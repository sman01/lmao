land-rover,discovery,2003,iward1, 08/05/2014,Find a good one,5,"I bought my 2003 Disco with 98k miles for $6000 in September 2013. Have a Land Rover specialist (preferably not a dealer) do a thorough inspection before you buy. Get a service history.
Expect a lot of work to have been done. The only red flag is a history of overheating associated with a very loud engine knock/tap.
In the last 10k miles I have replaced the power steering pump and done regular maintenance, about $1200 total. I'm not bothered since I paid so little up front. It's a fantastic truck with an old-school feel. I average 11mpg city and 15mpg highway. If you love it and treat it well, this truck will get to 200k miles and beyond.

UPDATE: Feb 2017. 126k miles. Total maintenance has been about $2k a year. Not cheap by any means but I still love this truck. I have learned a lot about wrenching! I have a baby now and as a family car it is good, though certainly not as practical as a minivan, but infinitely cooler. I stand by my earlier review.

land-rover,discovery,2003,Pat Mancini, 08/25/2002,Worth every penny,4,"Great SUV clean, turns heads, sexy 
look,fun to drive, very 
solid,everything a hummer offers but 
more practicle. 2003 comes with a great 
warranty and if still in doubt about 
british engineering get their extended 
warranty. Fuel economy sucks but if 
this is a major concern than buy a 
Honda."
land-rover,discovery,2003,Toyotas From Now On, 02/24/2009,Don't be fooled,2,"This was my first and last experience with Range Rover! If you want to throw your money away, this is your brand. Do your homework before you get caught in the hype of Range Rover. I've owned numerous SUV's (Mercedes, BMW, Land Cruiser etc.)and this brand is truly ""tall hat-no cattle!"" Never purchase this brand without a thorough pre-inspection by a certified Rover mechanic. Get to know him well because you will be helping put his kids through college! You've just met your new best friend. The ride quality and rugged good looks are the only redeeming characteristics that stands out to me. Toyota/Lexus is your stand-out best-choice every day of the week. "
land-rover,discovery,2003,atldane, 04/22/2011,You gotta love this Rover...,3,"I know, I know...horrible reliability, very expensive, low mpg..but I love this vehicle.
This is our third one, and this one I am going to keep.
I have 130,000 miles on this Discovery, I am pouring money into it, but I love it.
It was time to get something more reliable and better on gas, so I chose a new BMW 328i so I could keep the Rover.
I now have a new car, but have my boy to take to the lake and use for rugged adventures.
You know the saying ""if it isn't leaking then it is empty"" about Land Rovers. well it is true, true, true! But worth every penny...I really love this truck!!! Very Classic...."
land-rover,discovery,2003,vgardon, 10/29/2010,"Dream Car, but not quite a Nightmare",4,"I have always wanted this car and finally bought one in 11/2008. It was already 5 years old, but initially ran well. However, after having it for about 1 year, major issues arose (i.e., O2 sensors went, window motor broke, major ticking noise from under the hood, etc). This car is very expensive to maintain and after a while, it just wasn't worth pouring any more money into it. Thankfully, it has never shut down on me, but I don't think I would buy another one until I know much more about maintaining luxury cars."
land-rover,discovery,2003,Peter, 07/10/2008,The most unreliable vehicle on the road.,2,"As the owner of a 2002 Freelander which I traded in for a 2003 Discovery I can tell everyone to take seriously the ratings given by both JD Power & Associates and Consumer Reports magazine (among others).  JD Power & Associates reviewed 38 auto manufacturers and Land Rover placed right at the bottom for the reliability of all their vehicles.  Consumer Reports magazine ranks Land Rover vehicles as ""much worse than average"" for reliability but also displays in graph form how much worse than average Land Rover vehicles actually are.  When compared among 48 other midsize SUV's, the Range Rover, LR3 and Range Rover Sport all ranked between -129% to -195% in reliability (a score of zero is perfect"
land-rover,discovery,2003,Pete, 09/22/2009,DONT GET SUCKED IN,3,"Don't let this vehicles awesome look bring you to purchase one.  I bought a 2003 disco 4 months ago in pristine condition. Until after having it a weak the Lifters failed, the oil pump went and needed a total engine replacement at 58,000 miles. Local LR dealership put in a ""used"" engine in ""good"" shape and repair cost $8000. Two weeks after getting it back the head gasket blew on the replacement engine! Also a $3000 repair not covered by the warranty! I have never had a more terrible experience with a vehicle in my life. It's funny sitting in a million dollar showroom around all these high end vehicles,while they're telling you that these repairs are normal. I sold the car after 5 months"
land-rover,discovery,2003,My New Ex Boyfriend, 05/21/2007,My New Ex Boyfriend,2,"Yes, it's true...I ran to him when 6000 lbs or better meant notaxes that year! and now he has cheated on me. He got into bed with a gas pump and I just can't trust him anymore! He was quite the looker, but boy he has a drinking problem. Seriously, I loved the look of this truck, I like the classic stying.  The romance fades from here. Although it's never left me stranded, OK once - E means empty, there is no forgiving here.  Have already done the brakes and I am on my 2nd set of tires.  Front end is leaking as it is prone to do. O2 sensors have been replaced two times. Rear door latch failed and while rounding a corner door flew open and bent hinges"
land-rover,discovery,2003,please take it back, 05/05/2009,Oh God I've Made A Terrible Mistake,3,"I have never known true regret until I bought my 2003 Discovery.  There it was sitting in the lot gleaming, little did I know that the Devil can come in the shape of a car.  I should say that I bought it used, with 55,000 miles on it, it drove wonderfully for the first 3 months when my monthly sojourn to the Land Rover Service Lot began.  Every light on my dashboard has lit up like the 4th of July sky, I especially enjoy the ones with the exclamation marks.  Every gasket, every hose, everything except the engine, whose failure I am currently awaiting, has failed.  Anyone who comes across this vehicle should run, not walk in the opposite direction.  A demon lurks beneath the gleaming hood."
land-rover,discovery,2003,propertybroker, 09/30/2009,"Looks good, reliable, well-built",4,"I am very pleased with my '03 Discovery after 95k miles. It adopted the 2002 Range Rover's silky 4.6L engine, and is as powerful as it sounds. Shifting is smooth and quality- sounding. Sharp- looking inside and out. My friends, neighbors, and client like the luxurious look of it and think it costs much more that it did. Vehicle rides tall on the road. I get a good view of the road and feel safe in the vehicle. Surprisingly quick acceleration, plows through heavy rain and snow. I have had the vehicle for 4 years and have only had to do regular maintenance on it."
land-rover,discovery,2003,J Davis, 12/27/2003,dissapointed,2,"Well considering I paid $41,000 for 
this car I have to say I miss my old RR 
98 model.

The drivers window fell out, Alternator 
packed up.
3 sets of brake pads in 1 year. New 
jack didn't work when tire went flat. 
Insurance rate on this car is 
ridiculous and every service still 
costs $$$$$ for the smallest little 
repair. Gear train is noisy as hell and 
people constantly comment on how loud 
the whining of the engine sounds.
Fule economy is amazingly bad and 
turning radius is a joke for an off 
road vehicle.
Then a dealer tells me that after a 
year I would be lucky to get $20,000 
for it."
land-rover,discovery,2003,jeevanga, 10/17/2011,Engine damaged after overheating,4,Bought with 29k and whole year of warranty left for $22000.Used for 4 years and put on only 11k due to terrible gas mileage.Loved the ride and apperance.No issue for 3.5 years then 3 amigos appeard but did not fixed. Engine overheated due to coolent tube leak and seems to be head gasket blown or engine cracked.Sold it to carmax for $7000.
land-rover,discovery,2003,Stay away , 07/03/2010,Stay Away From Disco,2,"I've had my 2003 disco SE7 for 3yrs. Purchased at 50,000. Less than 2 months, I spent over $800 on axle job. Next it was $3200 engine gasket leak plus a host of other issues. It does not hold second hand value either. It looks great and people think it cost a lot but I will not buy landrover anytime soon. Poor engineering period."
land-rover,discovery,2003,Malvert, 01/02/2007,Love it or Hate it!,2,"Problems: Serpentine belt replaced three times, left front headlight twice, third brake light, leaking throttle body heater gasket replaced three times, rear brakes at 25k, now new brakes front and rear at 54k (doing myself). New tires at 46k. DVD screen wiring came loose, vacuum lines replaced at 53k. Horrible turning radius. 10 seconds 0-60. Vomit inducing cruise control.  My wife loves this truck. I personally hate it...but fail to mention this to her. The styling is great but the mechanicals and electricals are just terrible. LR would sell a ton of trucks if they could just improve the quality of their products.   Good things: Has never left us stranded. "
land-rover,discovery,2003,ROVER NO MORE, 07/28/2009,Disco is dead,1,"My wife saw this Disco and had to have it and just like the music it didn't last.  The real problems started last year when we replaced the power steering pump, then the head gasket went at 67k, then the throttle body heater.  The car never went off-road and we had to replace the transfer case at 88k.  So much for its legendary off-road capability.  And Finally after all that we were told after a flashing service light, one of many, that the engine had failed and needed to be replaced at 93k.  Six years old five years owned, bought with 8500 miles.  P.O.S car.  Never buy english V8s."
land-rover,discovery,2003,NancyF, 12/20/2009,Better than the 2009's,4,"I have had this car for 4 years and put about 35000 miles on it have done my maint and have had very few issues with it. The Land Rover dealer here in Co is beyond great!I have looked at a lot of newer cars and suvs to trade to but the quality isn't there. Cheap interiors 2 that ,very cheap looking hate it..junk. As far as reliability its just as good as any chevrolet those have had issues 2 no ind suspension checked out infiniti did not care for there interior either! comparison doesn't hold a candle to Land Rover or Range Rovers int is amazing. And all cars have issues my dad was a mechanic for 40 years.. Not a car you buy even a Honda will not break down. MAINTENANCE!"
land-rover,discovery,2003,Duke974, 12/20/2003,Best in Class,4,"while no vehicle is perfect, the 
Discovery seems to be the best all-
around of the SUV's.  It performs like

road.  "
land-rover,discovery,2003,Nitzervon, 05/02/2008,Run from this! Land Rover is the worst.,3,"There is not a seal on it that does not leak, in 90,000 miles: new motor (twice), transfer case (three times), both differentials, rear driveshaft, power steering pump, power steering box, hydraulic hoses, starter, replaced plug wires (twice, due to sparking between wires), Brakes only last 10,000 miles.  I averaged $900 each month in just repair bills. Not to mention 8 miles per gallon.  My wife has a Jaguar that is the same way.  No wonder every car company in England has to be sold every few years. "
land-rover,discovery,2003,Dr. Mars, 05/17/2020,Very Cushy Tank,5,"Bought mine (a somewhat rarer SE7) from the original owner with 113,000 miles. Crazy? Maybe, but I love this beast!!! Have put another 50,000 miles on it since. Yes, it does require expensive maintenance by someone who knows what they’re doing. I lucked out by having Southwest Rovers in Albuquerque do all of the work, including a recent engine rebuild. Routinely take 1,000 mile trips with it; goes anywhere. Ice cold A/C, definitely turns heads and gets thumbs up at traffic lights. With what I have invested in it, I might be able to find a crappy domestic SUV. Never selling it! I stopped to look at a new Chevy Traverse...$55,000??? Are THEY nuts? I had an Alpine deck put in, still using the original Harmon-Kardon speakers. Bluetooth, phone, the works. White with old British thick tan leather. Not for everyone, but then I never considered myself to be everyone."
land-rover,discovery,2003,sgriggs, 09/14/2009,To be avoided!,2,"I bought my '03 Discovery II with 75K miles after a local Land Rover mechanic (independent) gave it a careful inspection and discovered nothing immediately wrong.  In the 1 year and 7 months since, it has spent more time in the shop than any other car I've owned (including a vintage Bentley!) and cost me a small fortune in repairs.  When I bought mine, I figured that none of the horror stories I read about would happen to me, and that if I was careful and took good care of my LR, I would be rewarded with a reliable ride.  I was wrong.  These things are poorly designed and built.  The only up-side is that it looks good when parked outside my house.  Which is more often than not these days!"
land-rover,discovery,2003,l-i-v-i-n, 01/23/2010,No-Go Disco,2,"I was looking for a great off road vehicle; this is not it. Despite regular maintenance, and no hesitation in replacing parts as the mechanic suggested it, this car still let me down.  Blown head gasket, blown seal, exhaust leak, electrical problem, stuck window(s), and the little nickel and dime stuff here and there (wipers, filters, etc.) that all cost more than on a non-premium car.  The car performed well when it was working, and could work trails like nothing I've ever driven, but enter into this understanding your obligation as an owner is to spend at least $3000-$4000 per year on problems; not just standard maintenance."
land-rover,discovery,2003,Peter Taylor, 10/23/2004,I Love This Truck,4,"This is a truck - not a sedan!  Don't 
make the mistake of confusing the 
two!  This truck has been, over the 
past two years, simply the best 
handling, capable and fun to drive 
vehicles I have ever owned/driven.  It 
handles very well on any surface, in 
any weather.  The ride quality is 
superb!  Easy to drive, it takes care 
of you.  I've found myself in 
precarious situations and have made it 
through unscathed!  With plenty of 
power and pickup, I've a confident 
feeling in any situation.  To anyone 
who daily drives the DC streets, the 
offroad features make this vehicle a 
dream as it makes it's way, 
effortlessly, through arguably the 
worse streets in the nation."
land-rover,discovery,2003,loooooove it, 09/17/2009,absoloutely wonderful,4,"After doing much research on which vehicle I should get for my 16 year old I finally decided on a landrover discovery. I found one at a wonderful price and its still running strong after 120,000 miles. Regardless of what the other reviews say it is a very reliable vehicle... Those that have repairs all the time just don't know how to take care of a vehicle. My son loves the double sunroofs and the ability to haul his friends around town. This is a wonderful vehicle for any teen."
land-rover,discovery,2003,thesonnyjim, 03/27/2012,Whatever you do keep it awayyyyyy!!,1,"I was the second owner at 38k miles with existing warranty paid 16.5k from Private seller about 5 years ago. At first glance I loved the car but after driving it for 6 months, a Nightmare!! The gaskets went, luckily I had warranty but still had to pay labor.
Every little thing started to break down, cheap plastic pieces would break off and cost expensive for something that should cost very cheap & actuators go alot. Make a long story short after replacing the rear hydraulics (paid 4k & 2 months in the shop) I took the car to a dealer that took it in at a value of 4700 and traded it in for a 2012 Toyota Sienna SE. I'm very happy with that vehicle. A Land Rover...Never again in this lifetime!"
land-rover,discovery,2003,mimi1956, 01/31/2013,Defective seat,2,"Our driver side seat craked a couple of years ago on our 2003 Discovery. The same seat keeps blowing the adjustment fuse. We have been getting burnt a little when we turn the heated seat on. My husband just noticed that it is black like a
fire was starting, checked my coat and it is burned where I sit. Called the dealer said it's not their problem, called Lard Rover od America and was told the same thing. I sort of think this is a manufacturer defect. This is probably why the seat cracked and the fuse keeps blowing. Should we get a lawyer?"
land-rover,discovery,2003,saharatj98, 04/06/2009,The good in the bad,3,"Oh, the stigma... You always hear the complaints and not the praise. Land Rovers do have their quirks. I have to say though that I will never own an American made car for reliability, resale, dealer professionalism, quality and just general engineering mediocrity. That said, the Land Rover shines in comparison. Many of the complaints are due to mis understanding as far as how it is designed. Reliability is a crap shoot. Mine have all been great. 288k on a 89 Rangerover is above average for any make. You have to maintain them to keep them happy as any European car. Off road these things are incredible and I've owned Jeeps of all types. These were never intended to compare to a highway SUV."
land-rover,discovery,2003,casper, 06/19/2006,never again,2,Poor interior comfort.  Horrible gas mileage and performance.  Re-occurring mechanical issues.  Yugos still have better resale value than these overpriced tanks.  Never again!!!
land-rover,discovery,2003,weinsteinb, 06/07/2008,Bring it back!,4,This is by far one of the best looking trucks ever made. The ladies love its sexy looks and the interior! Fantastic sound system!  
land-rover,discovery,2003,JC, 05/09/2005,"All Name, No Game",2,"After running my 03 Disco for 44k, my vote is mixed but leaning towards the not worth the price and could use lots of improvements side. Nothing big has gone wrong, but lots of little items have. Both front windows failed in a week. Gas door has broken twice, horn buttons snapped off, leaking windows, two oil leaks after service, brakes need changing almost yearly, spark plug wires went bust, cruise control is poor and punchy, and comfort level in rear is horrific, front poor. A/C vents just dont seem to hit driver in face, a must in Florida summers. On the other had, great looks, powerful, off-road works very well."
land-rover,discovery,2003,styve, 03/16/2003,Worst vehicle I have ever owned!,1,"The Land Rover Discovery is the 
absolute worst vehicle I have ever 
owned.  It spends more time in the shop 
than on the road.  From an electrical 
system that does not work, to a 
windshield that breaks without being 
hit by anything, the reliability of 
this vehicle is horrible!

We drive this vehicle to VT, and have 
had numerous problems with its ability 
to handle the elements.  We have been 
told that this is due to the ""extreme 
conditions in Vermont.""  I thought that 
this vehicle was for extreme conditions 
(the extreme conditions were snow and 
temps in the teens).

If you are contemplating buying/leasing 
one, stay away.  There are much better 
SUVs out there."
land-rover,discovery,2003,dblake, 08/17/2011,DISCO x 2,3,"had a 04, HSE destroyed in Katrina, Bought an 03 right after. Typical issue as
everyone elses. But one thing you have to realize is if you want town this type of vehicle be prepared to spend the maintenance cash. Yes its expensive to maintain & i have found parts via ebay OE sellers, in addition i happen to have my own personal mechanic with 30+yrs of experience & a 65$
an hr labor rate, so maybe not to shabby for me.
For sure if i had to pay the dealer for all the work done so far it may have been sold long ago. I am @ 127k, replaced the Head gasket which is now leaking again 3yrs later.
& just routine work.
Its long paid off now & i invested so much in repairs i'll run in 4ever"
land-rover,discovery,2003,What a waste., 08/12/2010,What a waste,1,"Bought it used I am second owner at 75K miles the brakes are hard until warmed up. The Header gasket is gone. The worst thing is the car has a bad engine rap, diagnosed as a lifters issue. The dealer and HQ LR NA in NJ will not back it up. Imagine a luxury car whose engine is failing at 80K! Absurd. What we have here is a well wrapped interior and exterior with a piece of garbage BUICK engine."
land-rover,discovery,2003,usexpat, 01/15/2004,Realize what you've got,4,"I've had this car since 6/03 and 
it has been the most enjoyable vehicle 
I've owned.  Potential
purchasers need to understand 
what they are buying--an offroad 
vehicle that has been given the 
creature comforts of a family car.  
You'll be getting
the best offroad vehicle money can buy, 
but you will be giving up some things.  
There are reasons fo the apparent 
downsides of this vehicle (e.g., 
slow acceleration... so I don't fly off

line, its a great vehicle and a lot of 
fun to own/drive, but realize what

land-rover,discovery,2003,tester27, 10/14/2006,Land Rover Discovery Not Comfortable,2,"Drivers seat does not sit back far enough nor does the steering wheel lift up far enough for me to get comfortable.  Also - gas and brake pedals are too close together...  6' 1"" - 220 pounds"
land-rover,discovery,2003,brad, 11/20/2009,NIGHTMARE,3,"Bought the car with 65,000 miles.  It overheated on my cross country move at 67K (left me stranded with my family in Nebraska) and now there is irreparable damage done to the engine.  I need a new engine which costs $12,000!!! WTF this is a total NIGHTMARE.  Be careful Head gaskets go early and often.  Land rover makes a horrible engine.  I thought I was getting a unique car that would be a beast offroad, but it couldn't even handle on-road driving.  I would not use this car to tow anything.  It says there is a 7700 lb towing capacity but the weak engine shouldnt be forced to tow anything but the car itself."
land-rover,discovery,2003,Mark Harris, 02/14/2020,Not a good vehicle to me,2,"my 2003 land rover discovery is fun but the engine has sounded like a Maytag ever since I got it at 165,000 miles now 167,000 miles it just blew up.I know everyone has their favorite vehicles and I believe that ford had something to do with the welfare of mine.Well,that's just my opinion.Happy motoring.

land-rover,discovery,2003,Run Away Now!, 02/17/2009,"Bad, bad, bad",1,"Purchased this vehicle as a demo model. Has been nothing but unreliable since day one. Yesterday I had to junk it because the engine failed totally!  Beware of this year and model car.  Look online for issues involving oil pump engine failures. The car was in the shop more than out -- sometimes months at a time -- power window failures, leakage, tailgate failure, numerous mechanical issues and basically a very rough riding car. Since this model year, I will pride Land Rover in coming out with the LR3 --I have heard a much better designed car.  But don't buy a 2003 Discovery!"
land-rover,discovery,2003,Charles Renaud, 01/11/2010,Nice Vehicle/Awful Dependability,3,"What can I say, I fell in love with the design but quickly fell out of love with the constant time in the shop.

I love driving my Rovie thus far; classy, beautiful looks with refinements, all leather, and plush interior.  I get alot of looks from other drivers, envious perhaps or maybe its not their cup of tea.  Have not had any problems or issues, however I need to purchase the original oweners manual, since there was none at the time of purchase.  I am going to baby my land rover or at least attempt to feather the gas pedal...I used to have a 1995 Chevrolet Silverado ex- cab...this rangie still gets better gas mileage than most SUV'S.

land-rover,discovery,2003,saharatj98, 12/14/2007,One of the last real SUV's,4,"   I researched this vehicle extensively and was warned about reliability issues although later Discos were to be better. I grouped most problems to improper maintenance. Owning other European makes I am well aware of religeous routine maintenance or expensive repairs. So far it has been just fine and I use it off road extensively. Having owned Jeep Cherokee, Grand Cherokee, and Wrangler I would never go back. The Disco has more storage areas, is much more comfortable and much more solid than any Jeep. Interior materials are much better and the suspension articulation off road is amazing even stock. Not for everybody, but one of the last real SUV's built for off road use.      "
land-rover,discovery,2003,Paul, 12/16/2007,Love my dirt demon,4,"I am a little biased here, I used to be a sales manager for Land Rover so know that up front when reading this.  I do love love love my disco. This is my 4th Rover (98 Disco, 2x 03 Freelanders (his in black and hers in Red), 03 Disco),  and I've never been disapointed.  The thing about the Discovery is that you have to understand what it is before you buy it and be ok with what it is and what it isn't. What it is: - The ultimate off-road vehicle, go anywhere anytime for any reason. - IMO, tough. I've never had a big problem with any of mine, but then again I do my service and repairs (most don't!) - Expensive What it isn't: - A Mercedes-Benz - Fuel efficient - For everyone"
land-rover,discovery,2003,Peter, 06/28/2008,Good off-road but unreliable.,3,"Good approach and breakover angles, but poor departure angle will have you dragging your rear bumper on steep inclines. Very fun to drive, especially off-road. Reliability lives up to the Land Rover reputation, terrible. Several major and minor repair problems. Thanks to the extended warranty I have saved about $5,100 in total repair bills. It is now back at the dealership again with transmission and engine problems, total cost? Land Rovers are great if you literally have money to burn for gas and repair/upkeep costs.  "

land-rover,discovery,2003,BarryC, 09/06/2008,90K miles - time to replace every gasket,3,"I loved my 03 Disco until year 5.  After 90,000 miles (147,000 km) every gasket in the engine had to be replaced.  What originally appeared as a simple oil pan leak turned into the replacement of the head, timing assembly, and oil pan gaskets, plus radiator leaks and other miscellaneous hoses at the cost of CAD $2000 in parts and $1,300 in labor. Other annoying items: the passenger window motor self destructed, premature fading of wheel well fenders, excessive engine knocking even with regular 94 octane use, seat heater failing.  The vehicle was serviced religiously.  My advice - sell before the warranty expires.  I'm used to high maintenance vehicles but will never buy another Landrover."

I'm reading things like ""problems after 90K miles"" and ""poor gas mileage"". What huge V8 SUV 4X4 doesn't? If you want reliability and good gas mileage go buy a Honda Fit, If you want a rugged off road machine that has good enough looks to take to the country club or tow your boat then this is for you! Truly a classic for the outdoorsman, but not for the weak!"
land-rover,discovery,2003,Dr. French, 01/08/2009,In a market of its own,3,"I'm coming from a 2001 Wrangler Sport and a 2002 Infiniti QX4 and I must say the Disco is unique. For whatever reasons, I love the rugged, quasi- military/safari styling and how the truck sits, especially from the front, and especially with the newly designed front end and lamps. I bought it about 1 year ago for $9000 from a wholeseller (it was about a 7.5 out of 10 with massive head gasket and coolant hose leaks, a faulty oxygen sensor, a broken glove box opener and a slightly damaged rear bumper and a few dings) and was prepared to put money into it. $1800 later it's a 9/10, puts a smile on my face, and is still cheaper than a Jeep product. More regal than the QX4 also and better leather."

But I absolutely love my Disco!  I read all of the reviews out there before I bought it (so I knew what to expect but decided I didn't care).  Something about these you either love 'em or hate 'em. Just make sure you take into consideration the high cost of maintenance on this vehicle in conparison to an American or Japanese vehicle. As for the style or ability, there is nothing else like it out there.I hate all of these bubble crossovers. Bottom line I've had my truck for almost 3 years and still look forward to getting inside and driving around town especially in the snow.  "

Since the vehicle was first placed into service, the vehicle has been the most unreliable, frustrating and irritatingly expensive vehicle I have ever come across, let alone own.  Although the vehicle is only 5-1/2 years old with approximately 78,000 miles, it is worth no more than the market value for its scrap metal due to its habitual mechanical failures.Despite religious maintenance, the mechanical failures have included: Rear-end differential failure at  30,000 miles; Power window failure at 55,000 miles; Blown head gasket at 55,000 miles; cracked engine block at 78,000 miles.

It is a very capable off-road vehicle and can even tough a 4000 pound boat with relative ease (braking is not so great). The truck has held up relatively well, but I have had a number of major problems including a blown manifold gasket ($800 repair), blown axle seals (warranty), 02 sensor ($800 repair), and the window motor ($200, installed myself).  Alot of annoying minor problems have occurred also. The gas mileage really stinks (11-12 town, 13-15 hwy) for such a small vehicle.  The car is not very comfortable, as you feel pretty crammed inside it. I would not buy another one."
land-rover,discovery,2003,skibum232, 05/20/2010,"Beautiful to Drive, Awful to Maintain",3,"I would love to rate this car a 1 but honestly cannot.  Purchased used with 50k in 2006 and sold in 2010 with about 90k.  Routinely the car went in the shop from 2008 until I sold it and typically was $500-$2000 a time.  The car constantly had issues with pumps, leaks, brakes, gaskets. The MPG too was horrid, at one point doing neighborhood/city only I averaged 9.8 MPG.  Mechanical aside though I loved it.  Loved the looks, the way you sat, the space, features, handling in snow and Land Rover knows how to make a car look cool.  Would I ever own again? Probably not unless they overhaul how they build cars.  My next car purchase I was focused on reliability and MPG and not just good looks."

It's a lot taller and heavier than my 01 Explorer Limited was and yet it handles so much better.  I have had some troubles mechanically though.  If you're looking for an 03 Disco you should make sure that the previous owner had the ""brain"" for the ABS changed with the recall that went out.  If not, expect to cough up around $2500. Tires have worn well as have the brakes. It's not a racecar, don't treat it like one.  It goes everywhere I can think of without a single copmplaint.

having only minor cosmetic differences 
from the 2002, gives it a vastly richer 
look.  Had a problem with the sunroof 
leaking and had to get the headliner 
taken off to fix it.  Not very settling 
when purchasing a $40,000 truck.
Some features seem a bit cheap, such as 
the automatic shifting gear.  Turning 
radius is horrific and the gas mileage 
is as expected for a large V8.  If it's 
the overall look you're after, the 2003 
Discovery is exactly what the consumer 
ordered, but with the great look comes 
some necessary refinements (don't come 
out with another design too quick

The 2003 redesign appears to have fixed most bugs. I have not had any problems. This thing drives and performs flawlessly. I look forward to getting behind the wheel everyday!

I have the navigation system and love 
that, although I wish there was a

a wreck. Gas mileage could be better, 
but I surely understand why it is not 
that great; the vehicle is made of 
basically solid steel and weighs 
around 5000 pounds.  I am completely

bought a SUV and if she wanted a 
different ride she would have bought a 
car instead.  The car is fun to drive.  
Since we have only put 1,000 miles on 
the vehicle, the reliability is hard to 
judge at this point.  The gas mileage 
could be improved; however, the 
purchaser should know before shopping 
that the mpg will be low."

listen to the radio station of their

figure why they can't boost it to 
something similar to the Toyota 4Runner 
(16/20). Turning radius is awful, but 
the engineer in me suspects that's 
artificially governed, so the reckless 
among us don't make quick, sharp turns 
and end up on our sides in a ditch. 
Power's great, and the vehicle looks

Everything you could want except for some of the worst gas mileage in its class. We average about 12 MPG.

body lean during cornering (even 
without the touted ACE option) is 
minimal. As stable and sure-footed as a 
billy goat off-road, but refined enough 
to serve as a daily-use vehicle. Road 
noise is minimal, and the suspension is 
neither too stiff OR too soft. Drives 
like a wet dream in the rain on city 
roads, so don't let anyone ever tell 
you that it's useless in town. Whether 
towing, mudding or hauling, what a 
capable vehicle."
land-rover,discovery,2003,J. Linz, 05/29/2005,Great family suv/ real off road vehicle,4,Great vehicle! Has been well worth every penny I spent! Powerful and good handling. Only service has been oil changes and a few minor interior window rubbers - had some sun fade. A great family vehicle. 
land-rover,discovery,2003,guillermo islas, 12/07/2003,SE-7,4,"The Discovery 2003 incorporates the 
engine 4.6 and transmission from the 
2002 Range Rover, the brakes were 
improved also over the '02, the front 
suspension was reconfigured to reduce 
body roll without the need of the 
expensive ACE system, so you basically 
are driving a cool series II Discovery 
with all the better things that were 
just available in the expensive 
RangeRover that made it famous. It is a 
vehicle designed 100% for offroad, that 
transfers a great handling SUV for your 
daily drive in highways. Probably the 
only car that looks in place offroading 
in high mauntains and at the vallet 
parking at the Opera in the same

surprised at the drive experience on 
the Discovery.  With the larger 4.6L

that with the height and weight of the

land-rover,discovery,2003,Tom Mignano , 12/09/2005,Don't waste your money.,3,"Driving the vehicle during the winter months can be fun provided you get rid of the oem goodyear tires. They provide no traction with a vehicle this heavy.  Ownership is expensive. For example the brake system is inadequate for the weight. Expect to pay around $700.00 per year if you drive everyday.  The wiper arms for the year 03-05 are proprietary and will cost around $120.00 per year.  Considering tires. new tires lasted 22,000. I'm on my second set. So around 1300 more dollars for two sets during ownership.  This vehicle is underengineered, expensive to buy and very expensive to keep. Even insurance will cost you more because of the weight of the vehicle will cause more damage."

powerful as it sounds. Shifting is 
smooth and quality-sounding. Sharp-
looking inside and out. With a skilled 
driver and without ACE, it still 
corners remarkably well. Surprisingly 
quick acceleration - very deceptive at 
stoplights. :) Plows through heavy 
rain, puddles and soft sand like a hot

anything you can think of, yet is

people who are buying this rig...  Get 
the Old Man Emu steering stabilizer as 
a first order of business.  Especially 
if yours comes with the 18"" wheels.

I got out of a Dodge 2500HD diesel 4x4 crew cab into this and was looking for something substantial, and found it in the Discovery. I have had no major service issues.  

The ""command position"" seating is great because you can see almost everything. I feel very safe hauling around my precious cargo in the Discovery and would buy another. Don't get it if you are looking for good gas mileage, that isn't what these were built for."

It has been disappointing, though, due to the amount of times I've had to take it in for repairs (approx every 3,800 miles while under warranty). Maybe the bugs have been worked out?  It is a good working vehicle, not a lot of bells and whistles that most of today's cars have. Is the trade-off worth? I can't tell yet."

After driving across the Santa Cruz river and trudging through 2 feet of mud and silt... I'm totally impressed if not shocked.  So were the heavily modified trucks and Jeeps I drove past. Rocky terrain found here in Arizona is a non issue as my new backcountry driving experiences have taught me. This truck may not be refined (I've owed a Lexus and a baby Benz) but it's endearing, fun, versitile and more stares and positve comments than the shiny Lexus and little Red Benz. People just seem to gravitate towards its bold styling and appreciate its brutish stance. It guzzles gas no doubt, but the V8 sounds way cool, especially on start up"

I bought my Land Rover used in 2008 for $15k with 75k miles on it.  Dumped a ton of money into it in repairs i.e. ($12K, head gasket, suspension airbags, braking system, front drive shaft, tires, steering arm, etc.) and have at least another $2k on the list right now (replace valve lifters and door mechanism and right ABS sensor).  Now it has 82k miles on it.  So if you run the numbers I got 7k (82k - 75k) use out of it and had to spend $14 ($12 + $2) in repairs.  You buy this car and you better be prepared emotionally and financially, because its probably going to get really ugly especially if you are buying this vehicle used unless you are buying it from an owner like me that just didn't mind staying on top of it and dumping tons of money into all the problems.  In that case at least you'd have somewhat of a fighting chance of getting some miles out of it before you have to dump thousands into it.  I am an older guy (54 years old) and I just wanted to own a Land Rover and I enjoy it and its just a toy for me and I anticipated difficulties but to be honest I did not think it could be as bad as it has been nonetheless I am jut at the age where I don't get myself worked up about it and just enjoy taking my family on road trips for with it.  But my sister called me because my nephew (age 18) wanted a Land Rover for his first car.  I said he has to read all the problems and join a forum for Land Rover owners and anticipate all the repairs before they happen and really get into owning a Land Rover and that she should put $15k into an account as a reserve fund for any repairs.

The hate part - at 67,000 mi the oil pump exploded. At 77,000 the rear main seal leaked like a fountian, the head gasket and a few other seals were leaking. Two door actuators, window crank and front hub went all before 100,000. I had a mechanic friend tear the engine down and put new seals in it throughout. When he went online looking for some information about Land Rovers he said he never saw such lengthy blogs about leaking oil issues like any other car he researched. I ran synthetic oil since 30,000 - changed the oil in the engine, trans, transfer case and diffs religiously. If not for the crappy quality of some parts and cheap engine seals this is an awesome vehicle. Land Rover has the reputation of oil leakers and garbage electronics. I bought it new so every mile was mine (110,000 when sold), and I am anal about maintenance but even good maintenance cannot help faulty materials. Once all the issues were fixed I had no more problems. I almost cried when I sold it as it has taken me to some great places. I also own a 1960 Land Rover Series 2.  Purchase a another brand new one - never.

land-rover,discovery,2004,Rover Rover, 08/25/2015,Best...and...Worst Vehicle You Could Ever Own,4,"This Land Rover will run forever...as long as you keep fixing it.  First off if you can't work on your own (and I mean not just small stuff but in depth engine work) or can't afford to pay for frequent repair don't drive one.  You may fall in love with it as I did.  The ride (heavy vehicle which lets it ride smooth with a little roll), the 4wd (works great in slick mud/snow as long as sensors are working), the comfort (great interior), stereo, and just general coolness of the vehicle (even though it's kind of ugly in it's own way) will make you love it after driving it.  Take your time looking for one that has been well taken care of inside and out with records and has head gasket issues....yes this way you will get a good deal...you can do the repairs yourself fairly cheap.  Biggest problem is if it is leaking around the sleeve which is a $4k - $6k fix.  The vehicle drives and handles great no issues with braking as others speak of...even at 5,300 lbs it will stop on a dime.  Corners great with no tip over or feel of it as I've heard others mention.  Back doors do seem a bit small for getting in and out of so keep this in mind.  Only complaint I really have is the clock...why would anyone put a clock over by the passenger seat.  But even with all that said I love it and will keep it...but again I can work on it and have a backup vehicle....Good Luck

His passat was wreaked and my 00 discovery II was badly damaged but no oil or coolant leak, I was able to drive home 10 miles after all that. For 8yrs my discovery II never left me stranded, as long as I keep up with maintenance, she was good to me."
land-rover,discovery,2004,druidess, 08/20/2014,Style and Substance meet in the Disco,4,"I am the original owner of my beloved 2004 Disco 2, which has logged more than 220,000 miles, many of them hard ones in Maine winters.
I love this car so much that I put in a new motor at 180,000 miles, but sadly just learned that the undercarriage has rust. The plan was to get a new Jeep for me when my daughter got her driver's license, but she's getting the new Jeep and I am keeping my Disco for as long as we can keep the rust at bay. Although in very inclement weather she will be driving the Disco. Some time ago a massive Ford truck slammed into the side grate of my Disco destroying his whole front end, while Disco sustained a slight smudge. Looking for a replacement when this one goes."
land-rover,discovery,2004,Mik, 03/09/2016,Will be buried penniless in this car,5,"I bought my 2004 disco certified from Land Rover Parsippany almost 10 years ago.  It is the vehicle that has brought my children home from the hospital and have loved it from day one.  I first saw a disco at the Short Hills Mall and was in love.  At 123K miles I have a 3 inch binder filled with all the receipts including:  A new engine, head gasket, leaking everything, check engine lights and everything else.  Yet, I love it - My family wants me to get rid of it but my comment is if your brother broke his leg would you get rid of him?  It is a family member and ultimately it will be my downfall.  Last year bought an Infiniti for my wife as she is done with the Disco.  She still drives it in the winter - I put Blizzaks on her.  Last thought, I serviced the car religiously and it still doesn't matter.

land-rover,discovery,2004,twisties4me, 04/30/2013,A truly special car!!,4,"Great Car!! Most misunderstood car out there. If you're not into having maintenance done then buy one of those look alike disposable cars, do not buy a Landrover. Excellent on-road or off. In 115k miles I certainly have not had any of the nightmarish leaks and electrical problems that I'm reading about, but then, I've owned it since new and maintain it, with much affection I might add. I've never ceased to be amazed with the quality of the switch gear etc. which we have BMW to thank for. The car is as solid as a rock! Stangely enough, for such a tall ride, it also handles rather nicely too. I love my Landy!"
land-rover,discovery,2004,Holly Hughes, 05/12/2017,Love or Hate,4,"I won't lie maintenance cost is high if anything breaks it is really expensive to fix although I have a non dealer to your mechanic that is able to work on it for less. Even with the high cost of maintenance I still love this vehicle! I have four children and it's extremely easy to access the rear seats. Other SUVs are a nightmare to get to the third row! This vehicle gives you the ease of a minivan, but the cool appeal of an SUV. Smooth ride, and handles well. Is fun to drive. Could have a bit better gas mileage, and better acceleration, but it's perks make up for it's shortcomings.

land-rover,discovery,2004,mmr1, 07/25/2013,"Sorry, but no Cigar!",2,"I'm the original owner of a 04 Disco and it's been a living nightmare. It's had excessive oil/antifreeze leaks, consumption, blown head gaskets, axle replacement, worn cam lobes/lifters among many other things and now the infamous ""slipped cylinder sleeve"" rendering the block useless! All this at only 100k miles on a car which has been fully maintained, never over heated and has had the oil changed every 3-5k miles. Sorry, but complete engine failure at 100k miles is just unacceptable! Other Auto Mfg's. today hold a minimum durability requirement of 150k miles and have far exceeded this on vehicles costing half what this one did. So no cigar LR, I'll spend my money elsewhere! "
land-rover,discovery,2004,Blakslee, 10/08/2017,You will pray this car from my penny less hands,4,"This car was a ""gift"" from my aunt and uncle. My aunt took very good care of it (dealer took good care of it) but my uncle did not. When my sister was in college they gave her an 04 expedition Eddie Bauer which needed very little work. Fluids, tires, lots of vacuuming and washing. The land rover was given to me by side I'd lusted after it for 9 years...and it needed a transmission for which they were quoted over $4000. So they said if I wanted to fix it up I could have it. So far (first 3 months of ownership)my dad and I have: replaced transmission, transfer case, power steering pump, high pressure power steering pump hose, an a/c line (that we broke), front pads, rotors and calipers, crank sensor position unit, alternator, battery, tires, minor interior trip, full paint restoration and detail, wiper motor, all fluids, abs shuttle valve, electric fan, (radiator not far behind), all the bolts that hold the headlights in because I sheared every single one while replacing the bulbs.                                              However the car was neglected for several years and it is a joy to drive. I can't quite out my finger on it but I absolve driving this car. It handles very well actually (I'm on 18 inch wheels), is quite comfortable (although a bit bouncy. Maybe new shocks) and offers a very commanding view of the road. The car is very tall however the seats aren't that much higher than my zj. Steering feel is great. Forward and side visibility is great but the rear 3/4 blind spot is hard because the rear seats are a bit higher than the fronts. Also because of how hight the rear window is and the spare tire, rear visibility isn't great either. Many things underneath the car are much beefier than they probably need to be. For weighing the same as my zj, the sway bars are MUCH thicker. The best way I could put it is the driving experience is relaxing and very enjoyable.                                                               Now stuff I don't like. Parts can be expensive. Do NOT buy one of these if you can't do the work yourself or have enough money to pay someone else to do the work. Find a local land rover specialist mechanic and make him your best friend. Definitely get a code reader. Because I have 18s, snow tires are expensive so I'm looking as getting some 16s from an S trim level. The location of the window switches in the front makes no sense to me. The wing mirrors don't auto dim and are way to small. There are some features that my two previous cars (both older and less ""high end"" than land rover) have that this car doesn't. The wing mirrors don't dim and they're way to small. The window switches in the front are located in a really weird spot making them hard to operate and identify. The passenger seat only has power forwards, back and recline. No up down, tilt. No driver memory. Cruise control does not have a button to reduce speed and keep it engaged which my 02 Civic does. No CD in dash. Have to load the changer under passenger seat. Also, the car is SO SLOW. It really needs about 50-100 more horsepower.                                         Features I do really like. Heated seats work very well. Car has 2 sliding sunroofs and two curved panes over the rear jump seats (car is a 7 seater). A/c works really well. Heated windshield is a godsend especially when it started to fog up when the a/c is on. It's a little thing but I really like how the doors feel when you open and close them. Car also has Hill descent control and perhaps one if the most sophisticated traction control systems at the time.                                                                    This I think is the best looking land rover discovery generation and perhaps the coolest 7 seat car you can buy. I haven't been through a winter yet or taken it off road but those things are fast approaching. It is a joy to drive and I can't wait to
 take it on so many adventures. If you can find a good one, get it, just be ready to maintain it.

Regular maintenance seems to be the key element, and catching anything suspect early on. My 2004 SE has 202k miles and is clean as can be. Fixed early signs of lifter noise right away (at 100k) by doing an oil cleaning flush and new Castrol. Been silent since. I replaced a right CV joint on my '96 SE7 (my favorite because they were still putting 5-speed manuals in them). It drove my family for 265k until I was forced off the road one day at 65mph and rolled 6 times. I could still open all 5 doors. Landed on its wheel. Amazing. Had two others. Loved 'em all."

We made the correct choice! Yes it is an expensive vehicle to both purchase & to maintaine; however, if you DO maintaine the vehicle properly (just as you should any vehicle) you should be issue free. We have never been left stranded, nor have we had any catostofic failures. My Disco is fast approaching 100K miles & I intend to put that many more miles on it.

If I had a complaint it could only be the fuel mileage and it would be a minor complaint.  The rig tows my trailer with no problem, hauls up hills easily and I never realized how stout this rig is until I borrowed a friends Dodge pick up.  The Disco is every bit as heavy duty as the pick up ans actually handles the trailer much better. If I located another with lower mileage I'd buy it."

for trips to the off-road rally

exceptional and true off road vehicle

Although it needs a long list of

most noteworthy of the upgrades is in 
the technology department."
land-rover,discovery,2004,sphengolly, 11/17/2003,New Land Rover lover,4,"I like the ride both on and off road.It 
is a truck so it is not a smooth as my 
brothers Mercedes, but is nice. In rain 
it sticks on the road and gives you 
confidence you can control it. people 
complain about the difficulty of the 
differentfunctions,locks ,windows,air,ec
t. but can learn and use easy enough 
with practice, as with the key into the 
ignition takes practice. There is some 
wind noise on the highway , but only 
noticable to me at 70mph or higher. It 
handels fine at those speeds never past 
85mph. Rear air is a must and I 
recomend the SE (like I have)or higher 
se7 model."
land-rover,discovery,2004,dpscraig, 01/26/2004,Love the Truck,4,"The best way for me to describe the

truck.  Yes, It is definitely capable 
beyond most wanna-be 4 wheel drive 
vehicles. My wife and I purchased the 
Discovery because of its unbelievable 
off-road capabilites.  We may never use 
all of its capabilities, but it does 
provide great comfort when travelling 
in erroneous conditions."

like sitting up high-even my hubby's Z-

It handles well and I feel very safe in 
it. It only gets 3 light poles per 
gallon :-) but we were aware of that 
before we purchased it, so it's no big 
deal.  The doors don't open very wide & 
I was concerned about being able to get 
my daughter in/out, but it hasn't been 
a problem.  Overall,I'm extremely 
pleased with our purchase. "

in the 9 mos. of ownership.  While I believe the 
Jeeps to be superb off-road vehicles (owned 
every model at one time), the Discovery is 
phenomenal off-road. The dealership offers 
excellent service and many perks, such as a 
day of off-roading that is first-class and 
exciting.  The vehicle has a stiff suspension, 
but is comfortable on the highway with no 
drift.  This is made to go on safari but has 
comfort amd luxury for everyday driving."

(what most people know today at 
Defenders), and the off-road heritage 
that has been passed down to today's 
LRs is just as mud, snow, sand, and 
rock gripping as in the past. The daily 
commute in a LR bears little 
resenblance to the original LR 
tractor/all around farm vehicle the 
Brits first developed, and it hasn't 
lost any of its utility. The LR Disco 
may now be a people-ferrying vehicle,

utility vehicle. "

land-rover,discovery,2004,Skarfy, 10/17/2004,Great SUV,4,"The 2004 Disco, redesigned in 2003, is 
gorgeous.  Make no mistake though, it 
is a serious SUV...If you want a ""car"" 
that also has 4WD, this may not be for 
you.  I love it, but it is not as 
smooth as, for instance, our 2004 
Envoy.  However, the V8 blows away the 
Envoy, and the offroad ability is in a 
different league altogether.  The 
interior is wonderful - love the wood 
trim and the interior light.  The front 
is roomy, and extremely comfortable.  
Was thinking about waiting for the LR3, 
but the Disco is uniquely Rover, the 
LR3 looks a little ""ford-like"" to me.  
Plus a new Disco is an incredible deal 
now that the model is ended.  Much less 
body roll than you think in such a high 
vehicle!!"
land-rover,discovery,2004,Orl Land Rover, 10/19/2004,Discovery SE,4,"I bought this car brand new and have 
had a great time with it.  I tow a boat

is extremely stable, even when 
cornering hard.  Very fun to drive and 
not everyone has one!  "
land-rover,discovery,2004,JakeBarnes, 11/04/2004,Long Time Coming,4,"I've loved the Disco since it first 
came out and I finally made the plunge 
this spring.  The ride quality is great 
for an SUV and the styling (interior & 
exterior) is a cut above.  I've only 
had it for 6 Mos. but it has been 
maintenance free.  The only shock was 
gas mileage.  Going from an Audi A4 to 
the Disco was a big difference, 
especially during a time when gas 
hovered around $2.50 / gal."
land-rover,discovery,2004,Peeete, 11/15/2004,I Love My Disco!,4,"I only have driven it 400 miles so 
far, but I am impressed. Coming from a 
sportscar, I am surprised how agile 
this vehicle is. Its not fast off the 
line, but it has plenty of power on 
the highway. The visibility is 
outstanding, and the handling is 
better than two rigid axels and 
ancient steering should be.

The vehicle is solid as a rock, and 
the finishes in the cabin are WAY 
better than the new LR3 (oops I mean a 
Ford Explorer). 

I admit I had my concerns about buying 
such an antiquated vehicle, but it 
functions very well.

Sure its quirky; some ergonomics are 
lacking but the old-fashioned, stately 
British charm is a big part of its 
attractiveness! A local dealer to fix 
it helps too!"
land-rover,discovery,2004,Paul Gifford, 11/29/2004,"The last Discovery, the best Discovery",4,"Have enjoyed every moment behind the

I had a Mercedes sports car, too small and didn't do well in bad weather.  I got spoiled with ""luxury"" items and didn't want to give it up.  I wanted something that was ""higher end"" but could live up to being an SUV.  I bought an 04' Disco and I got just what I wanted.  Unlike other SUV's, you can take this one anywhere and not worry about ""hurting it"".  As tough as it is on the outside, it still has luxury inside.  The standard features on the Disco would all be options on any other SUV for the most part.  So do you want something that is a real SUV, or an oversized car that claims to be one.  Land Rover is the ticket"
land-rover,discovery,2004,NavalEagle, 05/23/2005,A truck for all seasons!,4,"I have taken this truck to the Holister offroad park, and this beast performed fantastically.  I have enjoyed every day in this truck, and could never part with it.  This thing gets down and dirty, and cleans up very nicely.

TRUE 4 wheel drive unlike the other wanabees.. Good luck getting this truck stuck! The only thing I don't like is the key position. It takes a while to get use to putting the key in so close to the dash. Other than that it's a winner."

What else do I need to say about that. I was stupid and bought a 2004 model in May 2008. Okay I know it's now 4 years old now, but it's only got 46,000 miles which I thought was pretty good. I can't drive it without lights turning on every second and a dinging noise going off all day. Driving it will remind you of Vegas. My check engine light won't go off because of the gas cap either. It's funny how they use Land Rovers in Jamaica for off road safari's from 1985 but my 2004 can't make it to the store. If you are thinking about a Land Rover just don't do it. Go buy an Acura."
land-rover,discovery,2004,f-f-e, 08/06/2008,2004 DISCO II SE,4,I bought this vehicle because of its super cool looks! So far it has been trouble free and a real pleasure to drive. The all wheel drive makes it an excellent vehicle to operate on or off road and it sticks to wet roads with no problem. The sound system is the best I've ever heard. I've owned several SUVs and this is my favorite!
land-rover,discovery,2004,spider348, 08/11/2008,Great Vehicle,4,"This is my third Disco and I am very pleased. Much better then the 2002 I had. Tighter turn radius and more power are the most notable pluses. Everyone likes to bash the fuel mileage - I just averaged 18  mpg on my last tank mixed city and highway. The trick is, don't drive it like a sports car (just take it easy use a light foot - it will coast on it's own momentum a lot of the time) and remember - it has a big 4.6L V8 and it is heavy ! As for reliability, learn what to look for in these vehicles and have the usual suspects addressed before you buy. 200k+ miles and I have never been stranded."
land-rover,discovery,2004,Velocity, 02/23/2010,"A killer,last of the BMW Rovers!",4,"Excellent in the snow, sand (on Lake Michigan beaches) and rain. Poor gas mileage, but what are you expecting of a SUV that can pull a 2 ton sailboat, a 4 ton sailboat a short haul and jet two kids plus gear around town. Traded my first 2001 Disco SE7 for the 2004 HSE7 (4.6l v8) and it was a great trade! The LR3 is a DOG!   Looks and feels and drives CHEAP!  Buy a USED DISCOVERY II or II.5!  By the way, the replacement parts are much cheaper too from your local import mechanic!"
land-rover,discovery,2004,AJ, 03/07/2010,Don't buy 2004 DISCO,3,"I had always admired Land Rovers and had saved enough money to buy a used '04 Discovery last summer for my new wife thinking it would be a safe, cool, and reliable vehicle for our family for many years to come. It only had 44,000 miles on it and the Coil pack went out:$750. Then needed new plugs and wires because they were damaged too:$300. At 48,000 miles the Cruise Control went out:$500. The downhill assist feature never worked, but I did not have an extra $1000 to fix that.  Then at 55,000 miles the Oil pump went out:$2300. I had taken all the Land Rover hits I could handle, and traded it in. Land Rover should recall many features on this model due to an abundance of lemon-like problems."
land-rover,discovery,2004,nicedream, 03/10/2010,Nothing like a Rover,3,"Bought used with 40k on it, put over 60k more on it in 3.5 years. A joy to drive, with an unmatched view of the road and surroundings. Can tackle any conditions, been through over a foot of fresh unploughed snow like it's nothing. Reliability for first couple years was outstanding with only routine maintenance needed, other than minor electronics issues. Around 80k miles started with frequent cooling system issues, culminating in needing head gaskets replaced, a very common issue in the Disco in the 60-100k mile range. It's a $3,000 repair, so beware. Some exterior body panels have deteriorated. Overall, a great truck, but expensive to own."
land-rover,discovery,2004,Warwick Dales, 04/24/2010,Every day Tank,3,"This vehicle is only comparable to a Sherman Tank when looking at its off road capability.Been very impressed at what its got me  through and out of.To be honest most of the places i thought only mad or insane people would get through,i've saunted through with this vehicle.Fuel consumption is the only hindrance,otherwise good to look at and my wife looks hot in it!"
land-rover,discovery,2004,Dr Ralph Krutulis, 12/17/2004,On my 2nd Disco,3,"I am on my second Discovery ( the 1st was a 1996 Disco I).  This one is #141 of the limited Camel's Cup G4 Series.  The machine shows the influence of the BMW design team; it goes a lot faster, a lot quicker, but seems less stable in snow withstock tires.  The addition of Nokian SUV tires improves the traction markedly.  It was one of the few SUV's that I can put my portable clinic in, and still have room for the kids and their stuff.  The fuel milage is worse this Disco (12.5MPG) vs 15MPG on the prior Disco, but it had a smaller (4.ol) engine. I would look at the LR3 next."

I find the Disco sluggish, have to keep it in Sport Mode most of the time, which further impairs the already embarassing gas mileage.

It has a recurring issue of brake squeak which the dealer said they could fix for $250.00, but that it was not covered under warranty (5yr 50000 miles).  It's had to have several oil leaks repaired (Oil pan, front differential) under warranty.

"
land-rover,discovery,2017,Ira, 10/02/2017,Do not buy a Discovery.,1,"Bought this car due to the VW buyback--we had a Touareg TDI, and wanted another diesel vehicle. The Discovery ticked all the boxes:  seemingly solid build quality, diesel efficiency, great handling, and plenty of storage space.  Its price was less than that of a comparably equipped BMW X5/Mercedes.  We also considered a Q7, but there is no diesel option.   We have put on just over 2K miles in the month we have had it--fuel economy with 50/50 city/highway is spot on at 25.1mpg.   Can't wait to take it on a road trip and see what it can do.  It is a great riding vehicle, we have taken it off road a few times at our farm and it handled great--looking forward to the snow to see how it does.  Again, this is the most expensive vehicle we have ever purchased, but getting our $ back from VW was a major factor in deciding to purchase it.   Complaints:  the rear driver's side door was not assembled very well-the arm rest is not flush, but the dealer will fix it.  There was also a rattle in the exhaust shield, but that was easily fixed.  Thus far, no leaks or other issues.  The car is very quiet, and handles well for a vehicle of its size/weight.  I would recommend this car.

****Update**** We now have nearly 9000 miles on the vehicle.  Here are the highlights:  the vehicle needs snow tires for winter driving in Wisconsin--the OEM tires are horrible in snow and ice.  The 4WD system is great, and the winter driving mode are incredible, but the tires could be improved.  

-We had an issue with the DEF sensor in the extreme cold (ewe had a week of -10F)--it was remedied after several days at the dealership.  

-Our family appreciated the heated 2nd row seats and heated windshield, washer fluid nozzles, rear camera and headlight washers. 

-Great on a road trip--got 31mpg @ 73mph on the interstate.  Plenty of room. 

-The vehicle gobbles up DEF. Have extra on hand, but don't overfill the tank, as it confuses the sensor, which could lead to an engine shutdown. 

-The navigation system suck-no voice commands-sadly, it is much easier to use Google maps on the iPhone. 

-The sound is great from the upgraded Meridian entertainment system. The interface through the Land Rover App sucks--it drops connection to the phone, causing the streaming to stop. 

-I wish it had apple car play. 

-The bluetooth phone system works great--very little background noise-very clear voice transmission.

-There is a voluntary fix for the suspension.  I have to schedule time to take the vehicle in for 45 min installation of a new part. Haven't done so yet. 

-Got the vehicle stuck in both mud and snow on our farm--but was able to get it unstuck using some the fancy 4wd settings.  Pretty cool. 

It's a good car, that could be great with a few tech updates and better cold weather tires.

********Update August 2019*******

~29000 miles

The car continues to have issues--glitches here and there, in the shop for a tailgate that was out of alignment, DEF heater/pump issues, interior panels coming loose, the back-up camera and entertainment system work intermittently.  Never could get the hands free tailgate to work consistently. Additional electronic gremlins. Took forever to get a replacement windshield after it was destroyed by an errant golf ball while on the way to meet a client.

 Still gets great fuel economy, questionable reliability, and the dealership service staff were very inconsistent.  

Worried about future issues, costly maintenance, and low resale value, we traded it in for a 2019 VW Atlas.  Now we don't have to worry about anything--other than crappy fuel economy.

land-rover,discovery,2017,Hojoon Song, 01/13/2018,Poor technology and poor customer service,1,"My problem with land rover started from the beginning. This is my first land rover discovery and I loved the look and ride. However, poor knowledge of salesman, poor service department support and poor management of the local dealership as well as corporate office is the worst I have experienced in luxury brands. As much as the car cost, you expect the best customer service from luxury brands which I have experienced with other luxury brands. However, Land Rover’s very slow responses from locan and corporate headquarters to their inability to address the problem quickly is making me very frustrated. It has been four months since I bought the car and I still have not able to use the activity key. They are still telling me it is a software issue that has to be addressed from the corporate. My problem is that why did you sell the car and made it sounds like that you only have to set it up to work. Back and forth between the dealership and the lack of knowledge of what is going on is absurd with the company of this size. I am still waiting and no apologies and they are just asking me to wait. What about the unreliability of their phone app. You will be lucky to have their app working once in may be 50 attempts. You constantly gets poor connectivity alert to just not working app. They still have not addressed the issue. I believe this is a false advertisement in their part that they are selling cars that they are advertising as if the activity key of land rover is working but in reality it is not. How long does it take to fix this kind of an issue? How about their service department? It might have been my local dealership but the difficulty of getting in touch with the service managers to lack of reponse from the general manger when you contact them just amazes me. this will be my last Land Rover. I wanted to experience Land Rover and I do like their car but bad customer service is big part of purchasing a car for me, and it is not worthy it in the future.
December 2018. I had this car for about a year now and had more issues then any other cars. Beginning of December, this car had leak from the front windshield that soaked the top of the interior and water through the inside of the car. When I took the car in, they knew the problem saying that landrover had problem with the front windshield and problem with the sealing. I was stunned because I didn't receive any notice from dealership or company. They kept the car because I cannot drive that car with leaking and soaked interior. It is not January 16th 2019, car is still at the dealership and dealership continue to have problem getting the windshield from landrover. They cannot even locate the windshield. I have the loaner but missing my car that has my XM radio and data is getting old. I just cannot believe they cannot even locate the windshield and also have no idea when it will be done. No phone call from the manager to apologize or explain the situation. Never getting landrover again. They don't have organization, service and reliability that is required for the supposedly luxury SUVs.

I finally got rid of the discovery. Trade in value was worst that I ever had with any other car. I knew it was bad but no dealers wants to give any money for this car. Excuses....hard to find the comparable value, there are not many cars to compare, nobody wants used landrover right now...
I thought the one of the selling point of landrover was that there are not that many. 
At the end, I was completely dis-satisfied with the landrover quality of the car but also the service of the company and dealership. I am not getting landrover in the future. I changed my car to BMW X7. Love the car. Love the dealership and service.

Overall Im very happy with this purchase and my kids love the 3rd row. Car feels very luxurious inside and navigation and all the technology works well. I testdrove Audi Q7 and it felt like a minivan, very low driving position and very small 3rd row. I testdrove Volvo xc90 and I loved the car but the small 2.0 engine concern me so in the end I choose the Discovery and I feel I make the right decision.

land-rover,discovery,2017,John from Arcadia, 07/31/2017,Land Rover has been very diappointing,1,"Initial quality was terrible.. just terrible. Do not believe dealer did anything to prep or check vehicle before handing if off to us. List of issues so far, after 200 miles: 1. Found unexplained loose clamp in engine bay 2. Wire hanging loose below undercarriage. 3. Rear cargo battery compartment cover totally broken. Nothing holding it closed. Major safety issue in my opinion. 4. Check engine light coming on for no reason. 5. DEF fluid low warning, should have been full. 6. Air conditioner only works on passenger side. 6. Infotainment system / Navigation was totally totally useless on first trip. Since cleared up but don't trust it.  7. Car shuts off when shifted to Park whether you want it to or not. 8. Impossible to check DEF, Engine Oil, or brake fluid levels in engine bay. 9. Panels in rear cargo area are very cheaply made. The Land Rover Discovery is currently at the dealer being worked on.

land-rover,discovery,2017,Nick, 01/20/2018,"Comfort, style, technology, and ride are tops",5,"This is my third Land Rover purchase. I traded in my LR3 and kept my LR4 and added this Discovery LUX. Since I wanted all the newest features I went for the LUX model and I am not disappointed. The new technology is excellent. The safety and parking features are a huge plus. The dealership pulled out all the stops when we got it home and found the pump for the windshield washer jets was not working. They drove us a loaner, picked this one up and drove it back to the dealership and fixed it, then brought it back the same day. My only complaint is the activity key. It is not working so the dealer has ordered us a new one and we will try that. I have to admit that having the back hatch open and close by waving my foot under it is a huge plus when my hands are full. And being able to see the car and all it's surroundings on my screen while manuvering the vehicle is a plus. But the best by far is the smart cruise control. No more braking and restarting the cruise when I come up on a vehicle but can't pass yet. The car slows down until I am far enough away and then it speeds right back up. The changeable ambient lighting in the car is fun too!

land-rover,discovery,2017,VL Fowler, 05/28/2018,Like Riding on A Cloud,5,"We have had our Disco for 3 months now and never for a moment have we regretted the purchase. Before ordering the Disco we drove MANY other luxury models and were leasing a Benz. Nothing compared to the comfort and capabilities of the Disco. We were trading in our pick-up that was used to tow our 22' sailboat, and the Disco has taken on that duty with panache---never a groan or complaint. The dealership and sales rep were very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. I am certain that we will be repeat customers of Land Rover. The quality and craftsmanship are unsurpassed.

UPDATE: After 15 months of ownership, my original evaluation stands. Our Disco continues to serve our needs admirably and still looks brand new. We continue to get many comments about the vehicle and gladly refer folks to the dealership in San Antonio, TX.

land-rover,discovery,2017,Nikki Meyers, 08/21/2018,Never Buy a Land Rover Discovery,1,"Picked my Disco up last August...it was flat bedded back to the dealership within hours! It is in the dealership right now...it is the SIXTH time, and they usually have my car for 7-10 days every time. Only has 5000 miles on it and have had non-stop issues, many that you have featured on here. The infotainment system has been ""update"" 7 times and is STILL very much broken. Cameras, sensors, apps, nav, bluetooth, gets stuck off then gets stuck on even when the car is turned completely off and I am out of it...you name it...it's broken. It was in for nearly 2 weeks, and within a week I had to have it picked back up. Right now they are trying to fix: Hood cable is too long and could be a ""very bad situation"" (their words), the infamous infotainment system disaster, no less then 3 warning lights on, windshield washer fluid spilling everywhere and always showing it empty (even though it has not ever been used), and this big one: Twice while driving down the road (not while at a light, etc..) the car randomly shuts off and goes into an idle mode! The service guy today told me that he doesn't know why no one ever called me because it could have been very unsafe and he was sure that it scared me (it did!), and that this ""should""take care of it. Apparently it was something with the ECM and their was a needed update to the engine control unit that is the Powertrain for the vehicle! Hand to God that's what he said!

land-rover,discovery,2017,Babak, 01/17/2018,2nd Update to my original review from Dec 2017,2,"Current mileage 35K, I have had this car for 2 years and 4 months. Here is the list of new issues since my last update:
1. This past summer the engine started losing coolant. It turned out that the water pump had a crack in it. The dealer replaced the water pump, issue was resolved.
2. After the water pump, the A/C started acting up and would not cool the car. After three visits to the dealer, it was finally determined that the A/C compressor had gone bad. By the time they managed to figure that out, fall had already arrived, so I have not had the change to fully test that.
3. Right before thanksgiving, one rainy morning, with no warning water started pouring down the upper corner, passenger side of the windshield. Called the dealer and they said that it is known issue with all 2017 and some 2018 Discoveries (talk about quality control). They said they need to order a new windshield for my Discovery. This was 2 months ago. I have called the dealer a number of times and they are still waiting for the part. Meanwhile the headliner is already destroyed the carpet is in a bad shape. Land Rover's customer service is telling me to park the car in a garage and not drive it. They are offering me $35/day for a rental. Not a happy experience. Good luck getting any kind of support from Land Rover. 

*******
This is a follow up to my original review from Dec 2017. Mechanically the Discovery has been a beast with no mechanical issues to report with 20K miles on the odometer. 
My biggest issue with the car was the infotainment system and also emergency breaking system (land rover calls it AEB) not working. In regards to the infotainment system I can report that after 4 software updates in the past 12 months, the system is finally working well. As a matter of fact I got the car back from the dealership yesterday (1/17/2019) and they even installed Apple Carplay on my 2017 Discovery ($350 charge for the upgrade).
AEB is another story, I finally found a way to test a system without damaging a car (using cardboard cut-out of a car and also a person). The system kicks is very late, only with few feet between the car and the object. 3 out of 10 tries the system did not work at all and I ended up hitting the object. The audible warning is almost non existence. In general I don't trust the AEB system in this car.
All said and done, I feel a better now comparing to the first few months of ownership of this car. The dealership support is very poor (at least for my local dealership) and same goes with Land Rover's customer service. They don't have much power over the dealer. So if you run into an issue with your local dealer, good luck getting any help from Land Rover.
******
I have had my Discovery for 4 months now and have driven it for exactly 4200 miles. I had this car special ordered and had to wait 4 months for it to be delivered. This is not a car that I just picked up off the dealer's lot. I tried to leave a similar post on Land Rover's own website, however they blocked my review twice. So here I'm. The support from Land Rover or the dealership is non existent. They love you up the point that you are purchasing the car. As soon as you pay for it, good luck getting any kind of support from them.  The car now has been sitting at the dealership for the past 10 days, due to TouchPro (infotainment center) issues. Nothing works. From slow boot ups (up to two minutes), to entire system locking up, to USB ports not connecting or rejection an iPhone after 30 seconds. Bluetooth music streaming has poor quality and has connectivity issues. Cameras continue to lock up and not available. The front parking sensors work only when you put on reverse, otherwise they don't work (unless you manually activate them for 2 or 3 mins). Navigation locks up. You cannot receive your listen to your text messages on infotainment system. The Bluetooth cannot support it. I
 can write a whole book about it. On the 7th day of the ownership a screw fell of the driver's side door. This is the screw that holds the door latch in place. It turned out that the other 3 doors had the same issue. The AEB (autonomous emergency breaking) does not work. I ended up setting up a soft dummy (that did not damage the car) and drove over it at about 10 miles per hour (the system should be active a 3 miles per hour an up). The system never kicked in. The dealer is telling me to continue driving and are telling me that they don't have a way to physically test the system. The only way to remotely start the car is to use the Land Rover app. Good luck getting the app to work. 9 out of 10 tries to get an error message about network congestion or poor cell coverage. The steering is very lose. You need a constantly correct the path even on straight high way stretches. Overall very disappointing ownership experience and would definitely consider off loading the car once it is financially feasible.

We purchased this for our large family of 6 after previously driving the Mercedes GL350 and Infiniti QX60. The Discovery doesn't compare with either vehicle - especially in terms of reliability. In the first two months of ownership, the car was at the dealership's service department for 40 days with a laundry list of problems: car was jerking during acceleration, infotainment screen freezes, air conditioning comes out hot, constant error messages on dash, DEF depleted quickly, etc. Land Rover America has been difficult to deal with - customer service is not worthy of the luxury price of this car.

To tell you the truth I hate driving it....the stirring is very loose... can't be fixed....Also filling the gas was so frustrating.  It would continually shut off the gas.  It would shut off several times...took forever to fill the tank.    Took almost a week to be fixed

land-rover,discovery,2017,Tim, 03/23/2019,Highs and lows,4,"So initially the infotainment was horrible but the latest update made it at least average.   The car rides great.  It handles snow with no problem.  Recently during a big rain it started leaking down the front center light area.   I have never had a new car leak from a rain.  Very disappointing
Update after 1.5 yrs.   overall love the Disco.   Some first model year quality issues - Infotainment much better but several times a year you have to go to the dealer for an update.   Windshield leaked during a rainstorm but the dealer quickly fixed it.   
This is the best vehicle I have owned.   Even with the issues Live It!

land-rover,discovery,2017,LandRoverOwner, 10/30/2018,2017 is a Lemon - Unfortunately,1,"Purchased the 2017 Discovery with high hopes.  Within a month the air conditioner stopped working.  It was in service for over 40 days of the 6 months I’ve owned it.  They replaced the AC, did everything they could yet it would not blow cold air.  When temps are above 100 degrees with a baby in the back seat, it gets very concerning.  Land Rover has emailed me they are purchasing the car back after I opened up a formal case and it taking 30 days of review, but are now taking their sweet time getting back to me with details on the repurchase (it’s been 2 weeks).  Car looks great, but us surpringly small inside, has a rough ride, and has the unfixable issue with AC.  Dealership was very nice to deal with.

The great majority of my cars were German, this particular car drives better than what I had but the reliability is questionable. The car had being in the shop now 3 times with only 16K miles. Biggest issue had being with the Turbo Management system, it had gone to Restrictive Drive 4 times and check engine light is now in the dashboard. Disappointing experience after I had spend $60K in an SUV. My expectation for the brand was much higher than what they are delivering. I'm hopping that I can get the issues resolved as I love the how the car drives.

land-rover,discovery,2017,Terri McCall, 04/02/2019,Landrover Discovery 5 Meltdown,3,"I purchased a 2017 Discovery Diesel in  November 2017.  I've had it at the dealership for multiple reasons since owning it. I also had the leaking windshield and it took months for them to get another windshield. After that was replaced I sill had condensation forming in the vehicle. The dealership took it back, removed the carpeting and ""let it dry out"". Now I have what appears to be a place that has melted on the rear spoiler just to the left of the LED light in the spoiler. The dealership said I or someone / something must have done it. I've shown it to a dozen folks and no one can figure it out. I don't know exactly when it happened as I don't always notice that spoiler. All I know is it happened between Jan 18th - march 03 2019. I wish I could figure out how it happen / what happened. Spoiler is said to be $1500 and then it has to be painted.

HSE Si 6 in Frienze Red Metallic with the blackout package.  The ride, comfort, handling and performance is excellent. Love it.  I have had no problems with it.  I have had it for almost two years now and the Dealer just upgraded the infotainment system like the new Velar to include Apple Car Play and Android something. It stills rides like new and what it can do off road is unreal.  If you are looking for a great riding, great looking large SUV, there is nothing better.  11/22/19 I've had it for 2 1/2 years now and it has not been in the dealer for any warranty work.  Its now the end of May 2020.  Runs great, no warranty work at all. 45,000 and all I did was change oil, filters, brakes and tires.  I use it to tow my 28' camper and have no problems.

land-rover,discovery,2017,landroversucks, 01/22/2020,They need a zero star review for this vehicle,1,"Leased brand new 2017 Land Rover Discovery HSE TD6 AWD.  Family of 6 so we need to have the third row and this vehicle promised to combine comfort, reliability, and luxury.  None of those things were true.  The vehicle was delivered to us with the interior drivers door panel detached and hanging from wires.  Windows would not open and radio/information panel acting weird.  Problems were repaired only to have water coming from upper center console leaking into cabin two weeks later.  10 days to repair.  Few weeks later car starts to surge and vibrate loudly when we travelled more than 65miles/hr.  Another few weeks of repair.  Over the past 26 months of ownership problems have ranged from the annoying to the absurd:

-leaky windshield/sunroof (3 times repaired and still leaking)
-electrical glitches with entertainment console 
-hood cable snapped twice - one time the vehicle would not start because I had to add DEF fluid but couldn't open the hood to add it!
-car found dead and unresponsive on driveway needing to be hauled away by dealership on a flat bed because they couldn't even open the doors (never was given a reason as to what caused this other than they've never seen this before)
-defrost fan screaming when turned to max (blower fan changed out twice)
-vehicle groans after 65 miles/hr and the noise is so loud the driver and front passenger need to raise their voices to speak to each other (problem still exists even though we've taken car in 6 times for repair - service says they have no idea)
-windshield wipers messed up
-whistling noise in cabin when on highway - service can't find air leak
-condensation inside cabin every day making everything moist and sticky

Save yourself the hassle and aggravation.  Most frustrating, annoying vehicle experience I've ever came across.  Dealership was zero help and never proposed any solutions or resolve.  I've spoken to the general ,manager, service manager, sales team and they all shrug tell me ride out my lease.

I personally contacted Land Rover and expressed my distress on this and they spent 2 months ""researching"" this only to come back with the obvious that the vehicle is a dud.  They agreed to purchase the vehicle from me (now only 11 months to go on the lease and most of the negative equity has been paid for by yours truly) BUT ONLY if I purchase a new vehicle from them.  So I guess they figure they can treat their customers like crap and then try to force them to get stuck with another one of their crummy vehicles and do it all with a smile on their face and make it seem like they are doing you the favor.

Then it started to leak through the windshield just like everybody else said. They replaced it within a week. 6 months later it’s leaking everywhere else now. The carpet is soaked everywhere and it smells. You can hear the water inside the panels of the car swooshing around every time I brake or accelerate. The dealer WARREN HENRY in Miami is TERRIBLE. They have a 6 week wait for service. I’m going to sell my car next year before the warranty is up. I probably won’t buy a Land Rover again. And I’ll never buy from Warren Henry.

land-rover,discovery,2018,Johnny Walker, 03/05/2019,Get used to driving a loaner,2,"We've owned Land Rover products for nearly 20 years, and 5 years ago we left for Toyota (we purchased a 4runner and a Lexus SUV) because the frustrations of owning a Land Rover were interrupting our life (the service manager and Land Rover and I used to joke, that I should park the cars at the dealership, because they spent more time in the shop than in my garage).  After, NEVER having any issues with Toyota or Lexus for 4-years, we made the decision to go back to Land Rover and give the company the benefit of the doubt and purchased a 2018 Discovery (new from dealer) and 2018 Range Rover Sport (new from dealer) and both in cash.   So, after racking up 7,000 miles and 5 months,  the Discovery has been in the shop 18 days, major brake issues (sticking), software issues, and AEB issues.  The Range Rover Sport is having the brake issues and software issues and has enjoyed about 8 days in the shop.  We have serious mixed emotions, the Land Rover products are awesome in the snow, off-road and as daily haulers.  But, once again I am sitting on two vehicles that have lost a significant amount of their value and I'm back and forth to the service facility.  The Dealership has been super responsive and helpful while the work on a DFT (Dealer Facilitated Trade) for the Discovery (but no promises).  Moral of our story will be to drive these for another 3 years, and trade them in for Ford, Toyota (Lexus) or Jeep.  The moral of the story for you is simple, don't buy a Land Rover product, this is our recommendation after driving them on/off for 20-years.

land-rover,discovery,2018,Carl Morgan, 12/19/2018,Don't ever buy a Land Rover,1,"We bought a brand new 2018 car from Land Rover. Within 30 days it was in the shop for repair. Over the next 90 days it was sent back for repair 5 more times. They told us it was a factory defect, and then over the next 3 months we were given a old, used, late model Land Rover while they came up with some ""options"" for us. All while we continued to make monthly payments on a $92,000 car. They finally got back to us and informed us that we could accept a lesser vehicle then we had purchased. Upon hearing this news, we simply asked to get out of the deal. They then said we would have to pay nearly $5,000 to get out of the deal. This seems insane to me so I contacted the corporate office and they told us ""that's their policy"". I am now paying $5000 to get out of this nightmare. From top to bottom Land Rover is a disgusting corporation, with terrible vehicles, and even worse customer service. I simply plead with anyone considering a Land Rover, that they hear my warning. DON'T BUY A LAND ROVER! Nn

First windshield leaked.  . . took about a month to get a replacement that wasn't broken.  Now in the shop for the FOURTH time for ""Engine Oil Critically Low"" warning on dash.  Oil has never been low when checked.  Sensors have been replaced to no avail.  Dealership has been terrific, provided great loaners and service, but I am tired of dealing with this error.

land-rover,discovery,2018,kevdi, 01/15/2019,DISCO LOVER,3,"JAN2020 Update: Change of heart - predominantly regarding Land Rover failure to honor vehicle warranty in a reasonable timeframe.  My 2018 Discovery HSE LUX experienced a failed front windshield seal (per LR maintenance tech) in early DEC 2019 that allowed significant rain water intrusion into the cabin - soaking the headliner, filling the center console with water, and soaking the passenger side floor board from behind the glove compartment (to be clear - all windows were closed).  Upon start up - the HUDS malfunctioned due to electrical system shorting from the water intrusion behind the dashboard (per the LR maintenance tech).  My LR dealer acknowledged this problem as not unique to my vehicle - and fixed the windshield seal.  However - I (and my LR dealer) have been fighting LR UK for six weeks now trying to get them to release replacement HUDS components for my SUV's repair.  In meantime - I found my passenger rear seat heating to be non operative.  Fighting similar parts battle with LR to repair seat heat.  For the record - the Voice Navigation system has never worked and is the absolute worst of any vehicle I have ever owned.  Repeated trips to dealer have yet to correct this Vox Navigation software deficiency, nor have they brought me any closer to correcting the other stated warranty issues.  I have recently submitted a Lemon complaint to LR USA Customer Relations as a result.  Awaiting their review and feedback.

NOV2018 Original: Wife and I went on a Land Rover off road excursion at the Biltmore Estate the winter prior to making the purchase.  Enjoyable and informative morning driving through the snow covered trails!  Worth the time if you're new to the LR Brand.  When we were ready to move into a new SUV - the LR dealer actually allowed us to test drive our new Discovery over a long weekend before making the decision to buy.  Beautiful design and color combo right off of the show room floor - an Eye Catcher.  Fell in love!  Has been a great road trip and weekend getaway SUV - Fun to drive - Comfortable and roomy.   Very cool HUD - Handles well - Quiet on the road.  Plenty of power - Surprisingly smooth transmission.  Functional - Has accommodated 7 adults, Carried my bikes, and towed my 6500 lb boat all with equal ease.  Take time to learn the infotainment system - you won't be disappointed.  Overall very pleased with our purchase!

I liked the taller rear window in the Discovery and the cargo area better than the Evoque.  My first test drive I was unimpressed by the car's acceleration. However, after about 30 minutes on the test drive, I noticed the vehicle seemed responsive to my lead-foot antics. At the end of the test drive for the Discovery, I realized it was a very good value for a Land Rover family of cars vehicle.  I purchased my Discovery HSE Sport and have enjoyed it very much. According to the Land Rover Service Manager the vehicle is fitted with ""adaptive driving"" function with the transmission which I believe has caused my Discovery to be much quicker in starting off-the-line acceleration.  The only thing I don't like is the ECO feature which you must turn off to keep the vehicle running at a long stop light.  Otherwise, all is good. I found out the vehicle doesn't come with a cargo cover which is about $400. Nevertheless, I'm impressed overall and now realize I had saved a bundle of cash buying the Discovery over the Evoque. I highly recommend this vehicle.

That did it for me! In 2 years time the car stayed in the shop for 45 days. I opened up a claim through the manufacturer and the best they could come up with was we will compensate two months of payments and did not approve a buy back. That is not good enough.

test drive the Evoque.  I spotted a white and black
Discovery Sport and basically, it was over for the
Evoque.    I had previously read
about all the ""issues"" with the Discovery and found not one complaint to be true.  I had no
trouble with acceleration or rough starts.
All questions and concerns were answered and
reviewed with the salesperson.  One test drive,
in the rain, was over 2 hours long.  I wanted to

"
land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Fazz Powell, 10/17/2015,After 4.5 years we still love our 2016 Discovery,5,"Update 2020: Edmunds wanted me to update my review. Not sure how this works with my old review, but I'll still loving this car. No complaints or issues since my last review. I have seen the new version of the Discovery and I can't say I like the view of the boot. Just not as sexy as before. These 2016s seem to be holding value pretty well. In 2016 I paid $41K off the lot w/tax, it's worth $29.6K today (Private sale).
Update 2018: After 2.5 years, 6K miles had my battery go up, but that's normal for Florida. Even tho I only I have 6K miles at 2.5 yrs I had the 30K mile check-up: $750. Original: We took delivery of a 2016 Discovery Sport this week and have to say we couldn’t be happier with this purchase. While waiting 3 months for delivery I was reading the reviews and frankly had been quite worried by the bad press. We also test drove the full-size Sport before buying the Discovery and found the almost twice as expensive Sport to have clunky breaking, albeit a luxurious interior. I had a Mercedes GL450, which we found too hard to get in and out of and quite a sterile interior, and compared to the Discovery it was not nearly as comfortable and the transmission was more cumbersome/computerized than the Discovery…by far. So I don’t get the bad reviews. The Discovery Sport in sports mode is super smooth in acceleration and I have not experienced any of the down-shifting issues mentioned in the many reviews. Granted I live in a small town and I didn’t buy the car based on its 0-60 rating. When I first test drove the Discovery I was taken a bit back by the sparse interior by Land Rover standards, but all the dealer had was black. One also has to consider this is a low-cost Land Rover product. I ordered an SE with a Glacier Brushed Aluminum interior and it was very nice and the steering wheel is much more comfortable than the $75K GL450 with the premium 2 upgrade package I had. On the SE the two-tone roof option was only $350 which really sets it off from the competition for look and feel. We looked at every car in this price range and would recommend it to anyone in this market. Fingers crossed on maintenance, but my CPO GL450 had to have a leaking shock absorber replaced with only 28,000 miles and it was not covered by the Benz CPO and cost $900, so I don’t think Mercedes offers any better in quality.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,i. scott, 02/10/2016,4 months In - updated after 3years,5,"This has been a great vehicle, meeting all my expectations. Have even taken it off road the way it was intended and it turned out as expected. Had it axles deep in mud and water:)  Really enjoying this for the daily commute as well as weekend trips

Have four months and over 3000 miles on the Discovery so far. Found the ride and finish to be excellent. Fuel consumption is better than expected, short trips to and from work in the low 20's, highway between 26-28. Managed 30.9 on a long highway trip thru NC mountains! Haven't taken off road yet, but expect to use the 4WD modes this winter.  Interior gets lots of positive comments, rear seats for tall passengers is great. Looked at the Q5/7, Infinity QX line, Porsche Maycan & Cayenne, found the Discovery to fit all my needs for passenger room, cargo area, and towing, as well as fit and finish. Did not expect it to be a speed demon, but the turbo kicks in nicely when needed. Ride is very comfortable on in-town roads, very smooth on the highway and a delight thru the mountain curves.  The pano roof makes the interior very well lit and roomy during the day.  I ordered the options and color I wanted, which took 3 months due to the end of European summer holidays, it has been well worth the wait.
I have had the Discovery almost a year now and 7800 miles, the SUV has been excellent in both reliability and enjoyment.  Average fuel economy is 22-25 in-town and almost 30 on the highway. The DS can be driven quite sedately, or push aggressively where the turbo really makes it take off.  the flexible and large cargo area has come in handy. Really glad I got this.
After over 4 yrs now, this still drives like new. All the things I expected are still valid.  Has been reliable, with just the usual, tires and brakes needed. Overall been a great vehicle so far.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Pat Kudo, 12/07/2015,Discovery Sport 2016 a winner for the driver!,5,"Before buying the 2016 Discovery Sport HSE, I had gone months of research and pricing with many dealers.  I am new to the brand as I have been a BMW customer for 15 years. Strayed away from mass German brand and found the smaller production British car to be what I was looking for.  I test drove: Audi Q5, Porsche Macan S, BMW X3 & X4, Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit, and Mercedes GLE300.  After the test drives, I knew the car that connected me to the road: Land Rover Discovery Sport.  
Be aware that JLR dealers outside your ""market area"" may not sell to you so you have to ask before negotiating.  I did all my negotiating between 2 dealers via phone, email and text.  Did not have to step inside the dealer's lot - I had already test drove the 2015 model earlier..  
As for the dealer, you have to find the one that matches you - they are all different - just like people.  Some dealers are snobby, snooty, rude, and others are very helpful, professional and patient.
If you are financing or leasing, it pays to find out what are the best bank rates before you negotiate  Some dealers are forthcoming and will tell you the finance rate or lease residual/money factors.  I dealt with 2 dealers that were very transparent in their sales approach.
The car has a bit stiffer suspension than the other cars I test drove, but the connection to the road is more important and the suspension is not jarring - it has manners....
The most important feature standard on this car that makes the drive so good: Torque Vectoring by braking.  Torque vectoring makes high speed turns, power acceleration into turns, and off road handling a must have for confidence if you are the driver type.
I love the car - it makes me smile again - like I remember when I had my first 4WD BMW.  The Discovery Sport is definitely for someone or a family that wants to travel almost anywhere safely and comfortably.

UPDATE: 2016 - New software loaded for the Powertrain and Infotainment has changed the car entirely.  Engine is now very quick to engage with no more laggy acceleration.  The navigation is reliable 100% of the time.  Fuel tank reading is now accurate.  I LOVE THIS CAR !

UPDATE: 2017 - Updates for the seat rattles, In Touch controls, Navigation, Auto Start Stop, and service reminder all done at no cost was EXCELLENT.  Good to see JLR changing their way of listening to customers and addressing issues with factory campaigns.  Service dept was very receptive to customer concerns. Good followup after the service work by JLR in England via written survey returned by post.

Since I have less than a year left on my lease, I am considering another JLR product to replace the Discovery Sport.  
Whilst at the dealer for service, I had a chance to speak to my sales advisor and he pointed towards the Range Rover Velar or the full sized Discovery that replaced the LR4. 
Both look very appealing and a great way to step a customer from the Discovery Sport.

So far very happy with the Discovery Sport and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a driver's car (not a mushy soft car like everyone else).....
"
land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Amy, 06/02/2016,Three things,5,"After debating for months between this car, the Mercedes GLC and the BMW X3 I went with this car and overall I am happy with it.  It has a unique style that people notice (doesn't look like a glorified stationwagon-hatchback), the seats recline in the back & thus are comfortable for adults to  sit in for longer than 20 minutes and the interior is not full of superfluous touchpads-mouses-etc so you actually have a place, that isn't the passenger seat, to set something down.
I have had the car for about 2-ish weeks and only have 3 issues with the car
1. There is no compass...for a car designed for off-the-beaten-path driving the only way to know which cardinal direction you are heading is to cue up the navigation.  I  miss the simple N/NE/E/S/SE/W/NW display I had on my rear view mirror in my Nissan.
2. The Heads-Up display is not bright enough to be seen on a Sunny day, but you will definitely see the reflection/glare of the screen that is generating it. 
3. The left-right arrow buttons on the steering wheel do not chose between the 18 preset radio stations instead they act like a radio tuner. (I.e. you end up going thru every single radio station that comes in, instead of the ones you know you want to listen to)  Kind of undermines the idea of convenience that goes with preprogramming your radio stations or putting buttons on the wheel to control the radio.   (If I am wrong on this, please someone tell me how to change it)

First thing no blind spot warning, we were told it was because we got the third row seats and they could not get the wiring in.  Got the black package but the material feels cheap and every so often it will pop out of place and i have to push it back in.  A lot of squeaking, cant change to preset from the steering wheel.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Jim R, 12/11/2015,Land Rover Discovery HSE - New to Brand,4,"Overall very happy with my new SUV. Drives great, looks great, and overall quality is very good.

Issue with turbo lag but I've learn how to adjust my driving to avoid unwanted turbo surges.

Disappointed in Land Rover’s Incontrol Apps and Hotspot.  The Incontrol Apps are glitchy and 50% of the time I have trouble connecting to my iphone 6. The JustDrive app that is suppose too be the ultimate in hands free but a is a 3 on a scale to 10; 10 being the best.  The Discovery 2016 has built in Hotspot, In-Control Apps, and navigation that require data plan with AT&T; cost less than $10 per month.  For this to all to work the SUV has built in cell phone with sims card.  The  kicker is the cell phone is 3G (NOT 4G LTE).  This means my 4G LTE iPhone connects to my SUV which is 3G service.  The 3G is significantly slower than 4G LTE, and definitely a huge step backwards.  Other auto makers are putting hotspots in the their cars with 4G.  I never would have guessed this was 3G.

I actually thought something was wrong with the vehicle after a few weeks of having it.  I wish I had given it a longer test drive before purchasing.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,BBN, 08/17/2016,Very Happy I got this,5,"Got this car (a loaner with 700 miles on odometer) a little less than a month and drove under 1000 miles.  So far, like the  car very much. Got SE model with Clmate package, Navigation and 11 speaker upgrade. Got the 19"" inch alloy wheel (without extra cost). Things to like - Handling is excellent. All around visibility is very good. Side mirrors are the best I ever had. Seats feel firm and nice. Feels very spacious inside.  Overall material quality has the luxury feel. I drive to work 16 miles each way - 8 miles highway and 8 miles local. Getting 30-34 MPG combined without A/C. 27-30 MPG average running a/c. 25-28 MPG with family of 4 and running a/c. So, much better than the 20-26 MPG listed. Engine is very smooth except when accelerating very suddenly. Radio / speakers are fantastic at higher volumes and with HD stations. Things not to like - The rear hatch feels flimsy. The panel below the glass squeaks a bit. No CD player. Radio is just OK at lower volumes. Rides a little truck-like. Other thoughts - Should suggest getting the higher trim level HSE to get many of the fancy features. SE does not get front fog lights. Wish it did.

Update in Feb 2020...

Had the car for 3 and half years and drove for 50,000 miles. The car has been trouble free. Needed new breaks at around 35,000 miles and tires at 48,000 miles.

Still drives like new. No squeaks and rattles. The service costs are a little higher than normal. My dealer currently charges 650 dollars for 10,000 miles service. Other than that cost, no complaints.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Raining in Washington, 12/04/2016,Low Quality Craftsmanship,2,"Been to the dealer to many times to count. After four months the vehicle check engine light came on; injectors had to be replace and black plastic on top of license plate had to be replace because of squeaky noise. About eight months, engine overheat when setting in traffic, cooling fan had to be replace. Also water got in the driver rear marker light and had to be replace. Ten months or so, check engine light comes on: it comes and go randomly (software had to be updated and problem solve). On the 11th month, rear passenger seats and plastic on A pillar made squeaky noise (parts are being ordered and will be replace in a few weeks). The driver seat is not very comfortable, had to get aftermarket seat cushion. I own this vehicle for about a year now and drove this vehicle in all types of road and weather conditions and there's a great amount of road noise in cabin, huge turbo lag and poor acceleration. A few pros: good exterior design, heated/cooling seats works great and huge panoramic sunroof.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Wes, 06/08/2018,Good Looks Bad Execution,2,"I have owned this car and put about 16,000 miles on it in that time. I fell in love with the way the car looks, its road presence and general cache. That is where the love affair ends. Actual gas mileage is abysmal, about 15mpg mixed driving. An NA V6 would get better mileage on a car of this size. The engine does have good torque and get up when the transmission is not getting in its own way so that you can merge or fight to the death on the 405 in intermittent traffic. The interior is very clean and no fuss, which I like, but it is a bit annoying. Since most things are digital, you have to pull your eyes off of the road to get anything done on the screen. I realize this is a trend going forward, but it is making people worse drivers, including myself in this confounded thing. The interior quality is appalling for a car of this price. Its on the level of older Korean cars, no joke. EVERYTHING squeaks, rattles or bangs. The center console creaks every time I accelerate, the rear bench rattles and squeaks on everything but the absolute smoothest road and the tailgate creaks over every speed bump or small rock. It is by far the best looking small SUV on the road, but after that, this package falls apart.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Mickey, 02/29/2016,Failed from 2nd week and no repair,1,"Dealer does not know how to repair the car.  The car failed after the 1st week I purchased it, then it went in and out from the shop for the following 4-5 months.  It should have rang a danger bell when we found out that the dealership was over 60 loaner vehicles.  They kept replacing the back up camera when the entire electrical system would shut off.  After I asked if they had tested the cameras they removed, I got  blank look and they said they did not know what do to.  They always have to wait for a technical adviser from headquarters to tell them what to do.  Battery error signals showed up and the dealership did not know what to do except blame us that we must be driving very short distances (not true) after 2 weeks they decided to change the battery.  Remember the Lemon Law if you are in California.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,neverbuyLR, 12/09/2017,Stay away!!,1,"I have had this car into the dealer several times starting with a coolant leak, failed water pump, computer system failures. The dealer didn't do all the work they said they did or the problems I had,  wouldn't have happened. One cylinder lost compression at 58,000 miles with no warning. After three months of dealing with Jaguar Land Rover USA, LLC they replaced the engine, however, everytime I picked up the car upon completion of repairs there was still problems with the engine. After the third time, Jaguar Land Rover refused to do anything. Everyone was so busy pointing fingers at each other that they forgot they were leaving a customer with no car. They wouldn't even offer me rebates to help me buy a new car.  Sad.   Even with their own mechanics and parts they couldn't even get the car running.  It was absolutely disgusting how badly Jaguar Land Rover, LLC handled this situation. You know when their own peers are shocked that they didn't replace the car, it is pretty bad.   Apparently, they only do the right thing when a judge tells them too.  Stay away from these cars. They are fun to drive, but Jaguar Land Rover will leave you high and dry if something goes wrong. I took an $8,000 loss on this car.  They know nothing about customer service and don't care if their customers buy another car or not.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Tesha, 07/18/2018,"A lot of luxury features, and superb driving",5,"This is the nicest, best equipped vehicle I have ever owned.  Motor was very strong with a slight turbo lag that just took some time adjusting to.  It was very picky on the premium fuel and would set a light nearly every other tank for emissions, no adverse performance, just annoying.  The adaptive lighting was phenomenal.  We drove this 4x4 5500 miles on a trip, did a little off roading and had it up to 110 on the Bonneville Salt Flats.  Averaged 24.7 mpg with 4 adults and 1 child in a car seat, plus our luggage.  The high altitude mountain roads are where it outperformed every other vehicle on the road.  The Navigation was worse than my 2010 TomTom and constantly rebooted.  That needs to be addressed.  We bought this vehicle used with 9k miles on it and saved a ton.  I would definitely own another if the price was right.  Longevity remains to be seen, but I personally will not own a turbo vehicle past 100k miles.

Only 30,000 miles and had to replace brakes - rosters and pads, twice! The car ride is terrible. You can literally feel every pebble in the road and it has a very hard time accelerating. Also the rear hatch inside panel keeps falling off and I have to snap it back in. I could go on and on. My suggestion, look into other suvs!

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Drew, 09/17/2017,The Worst Car I Have Ever Had,1,"This car is the worst car I have ever had. The gas mileage is not even close to as advertised. I am constantly fueling this car up and when I asked the dealer to help me he said there was nothing they could do that the car just gets bad mileage.  I am sure your gas mileage statistics must be fraudulent.  Worse off, the electrical system is also very poor and they are frequent battery drains  which caused me to have to get my car jumpstarted. I cannot believe I still have a year left on this lease as this is the worst piece of crap and completely unreliable.   I would never get a Land Rover again.   Buyers beware.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,OBX'er, 08/28/2020,"Good, could be better",4,"We bought this 2016 Disco Sport in 2020 with 44,000 MLS. We enjoyed our LR2 so much, we're giving Land Rover another try. The car looks great, very comfortable and roomy. It has a lot of features, handles pretty good and is fairly quiet. Although it's better in almost every way than the LR2, it's no better than our 10 year old Audi Q5. The Audi is quick, quiet and has better interior quality. I expected more from a newer car. If we had bought the Disco new and paid 50 grand for it, we'd be very disappointed. Of course, we would have taken a much longer test drive, also. But, at half the cost, it fits our purposes well . It has more leg and truck room than a newer Q5, otherwise we would have bought another Audi. The Disco has a smooth and quiet 4 cylinder engine, but don't love the turbo lag and the city mileage is awful. The ZF 9 speed transmission is pretty good, no complaints there. So, the Disco is good, but with a few tweaks, it could be great

The CX-5 GT has more bells and whistles than the Discovery Sport Se. The CX-5 handling is far more superior than the Land Rover. It’s been almost a year now and I haven’t regretted my decision for one second. The Discovery Sport is an overpriced, unreliable piece of %#% that has a Land Rover badge.

After that was done I did not wanted to buy another service package since it would be too much money. I drive this car off road in the desert here in the UAE some times and it performs great given it still have normal road tires and the 19"" wheels. No mechanical issues at all only a small vibration noise on the round gear selector knob, and vapor lock when refueling that is annoying. Had to replace the battery at 3 years of usage. Fuel economy is great here on mostly highways drive. Kids love the glass roof specially at night with a full moon. Happy with the car!

land-rover,discovery-sport,2016,Highegt, 08/22/2020,Smooth Machine,5,"Bought a 2016 SE off a dealer lot with 19K miles 2 years ago. Fiancé had a Toyota RAV which was an appliance that was traded on a great deal for the DS. Silver, black interior and like new. Almost immediately took into JLR dealer to have software updates done for PCM, infotainment and recall check even though all worked fine. Have driven about 30K miles in all sorts of weather also taking long trips. This vehicle is superb with linear acceleration, sure footed feel and comfortable ride. Heavy snow means nothing when mode selected - don’t even plow driveway. Torrential rain with high winds - same thing as you feel totally confident. Have experienced none of the complaints some other reviewers wrote regarding squeaks, performance and electronic glitches - all has been perfect. Replaced brakes and tires at 45K and maintain per JLR schedule. One weakness in SE trim are headlights not HID, but a set of Hella bulbs took care of that peeve. This is a versatile vehicle which always stands out from other small SUVs and will buy another LandRover when time comes.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2017,MKM, 05/20/2018,Ain't a Luxury SUV,2,"Although this car ranks as a luxury SUV and costs close to $50K with some options, this is not a luxury SUV in my opinion. I have owned this car for about 10 months now and the biggest issue that I have is the transmission - it is very jerky; it is so jerky that the passenger sitting next to me also felt it. I have taken it to the dealership many times, but to no avail. The other issue with the car is that the inside technology seems dated. The GPS  looks and feels archaic and is full of bugs. I am not happy with the user interface of the systems either. Lastly, the gas mileage is not that good. I am getting about 11 - 14 mpg during city driving. I can get it up to about 25 on highway.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2017,Kirk997, 04/14/2020,Great SUV,5,"I have a Range Rover Sport, this is big heavy mother, so I bought the Discovery for my GF.  I got her the Sport HSE LUX, and we love it!  This car is quick enough and great MPG, unlike my Range which is gas guzzler.  The Disco has plenty of cargo room, and quality materials and workman ship.  I looked at comparable SUV in the $ range, Jeeps too cheep and outdated, The Ford Edge was pretty cool, and a bit bigger I think and probably more features, the BMW's overpriced, the Benz way overpriced and smaller, and then the Disco, just a cool look, white on black trim and 19"" rims.  The LUX has better leather seating and a better sound system.  Overall, the Disco is hands down a better buy, of course I am biased to Land Rover after owning 3 of them.  But, I only buy quality and value.  I also have Benz and BMW for sport cars, but the Disco is just an awesome compact SUV.  You don't need the heavy and gas guzzling, I can get 30 MPG at 55 MPH.  Cool LED lighting in headlamp and a nice attractive dash, not to plastic looking like the other brands.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2018,Roberto, 11/28/2018,Very disappointed,2,"I bought this car for my wife, expecting it to be a great vehicle, being a Land Rover and all. What a disappointment. It is a very expensive car for what you get in return. First off, air conditioner presented problems with just 2K miles on the odometer. Went to the shop, took 3 days to fix. Same problem at 4K miles. Back to the shop, another 3 days. Same problem at 6K. Back to the shop, 3 days again. This is unacceptable for a brand new 50K car. Now car is at 8K and problem has not presented itself again so far. Motor is very weak, gear change is slow. Entertainment interface is poor. Trunk space is small. Forget the 3rd row seats, its cramped. Safety sensors surrounding the car go off all the time with nothing even close to the car. This car needs a major makeover to be worth the money. There are much better options out there for this price range. I can't wait for the lease to end for me to get out of this mess.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2018,Joe, 08/13/2018,Close but no cigar.,3,"We loved the style , size, and overall appearance.  We were going to lease the SE version(lowest end version).  We ended up getting another vehicle because most of the safety features and driver assist technology was absent on the SE model without spending very much more money to have them on this model.  Even the interior was sub par unless we jumped up to the HSE model.  We eventually decided against this vehicle because we would have paid as if we were driving a Land Rover while essentially getting a shell of a Land Rover.  One would expect a vehicle priced around 40K would be equipped with at least as many safety and driver assist features as a vehicle costing 10-15K less.  However, my wife's Mazda CX5 Touring has far more safety/driver assist features and drives just as nicely.  The Discovery Sport could be everything we wanted IF we were willing to pay in the mid 40K area.  It is nice but very overpriced for what you get.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2019,JD, 08/17/2019,"Great Car for the size, style, and performance",4,"This is a beautiful car at a fair price for a Land Rover.  It's a lot of car in a very small footprint!  (the Evoque was way too small for us).  The interior and finishes are great.  The glass roof is awesome.  The back seat is comfortable and spacious, and the seats recline which is great.  The gas mileage is not ""Like an8 cylinder"" as one reviewer wrote.  I know because I sold my GMC Denali 8 Cylinder before buying this one and my gas mileage is WAY better.  It totally depends on how you drive.  The greatest feature is the ECO mode which will automatically reduce all systems to lower gas and electricity usage. Very nice to just turn on and not think about it.  It will lower your performance and the strength of your AC.  It seems owners need to read their manuals because it explains this.  I get about 27-29 mpg on the highway and may be 15-18 city driving.  If you drive aggressively you mileage will drop dramatically.  The car is surprisingly quick with the turbo.  If you want full performance, AC, etc turn off the ECO mode - which I do when I want best acceleration, etc.  There have been issues with the Auto start/stop gas saving feature and with some random electrical/computer stuff but all is under warranty.  The transmission sometimes can be less smooth than others but it's negligible.  I don't think I would buy a high mileage used Land Rover because of this.  My biggest complaint is, it does not have the 'Activity Key' wristband for water-sports (locking your key fob in car and going swimming without fob).  It is not an option to upgrade to - which is really stupid. (still looking for a solution to this, short-sighted for and 'adventure car')  All things considered, all members of my family love this car.

It's very dangerous as when pulling into traffic or needed acceleration for lane changing. I've almost been killed many times.

land-rover,discovery-sport,2019,Dana , 02/17/2020,Very disappointing!,2,"I love the look of this car and that’s what really sold me.  I should’ve test driven it longer and in different conditions because I hate the way it drives.  I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the turbo lag.  I wasn’t sure what to call it or exactly how to explain but the car jerks.  Start the car, put in reverse and it delays and then jerks.  Does the same thing when you are stopped and accelerate.  Awful if you are waiting to make a turn at a traffic light!  After you pull into your parking space and put the car in park it will then roll forward about 6-12”.  Not good. 
When I brought it in for service they said that I have to “really drive it” (gun it) and it will get used to my driving and change.  Nope. Not true.  
I’ve been driving for 30 years and I feel like a teenager driving this car because it is so jerky!  It’s fine once you are accelerated and on a highway but I hate it for driving on town and actually getting on the highway.

I’m always afraid my morning coffee from the coffee Starbucks is going spill as I have trouble getting it out of the cup holder due to how tight it is.

Offroad performance which is a reason for my purchase is phenomenal and this is proven, living in Salmon Arm British Columbia. Overpriced but just buy a year-old unit, then it is a steal!"
land-rover,range-rover,2000,runtgun, 03/31/2007,Better than expected reliability.,4,"After buying a used 2000 HSE and putting about 40,000 miles on it, we've been pleasantly surprised by the reliability. In that time, we had the tie-rod ends replaced and the driver's seat heater element replaced. Nothing else has failed and it still drives like new. The Michelin tires are hardly worn (original!).  The small details (side mirrors dimmable, etc) are welcome, but it's the solid, unflappable performance on poor traction surfaces that makes it our favorite vehicle."

The first was a SE 4.0 1998.  That 
model was under powered but other than 
that very reliable.  The 4.6 HSE 2000 
model is a great improvement.  More 
power  with about the same gas milage 
as the 4.0. Navigation system is much 
better than my wifes 740IL.  Great 
highway car, supurb towing boats, and 
unmatched off road.  This is not a car 
to just drive around town in.  Buy it 
because you will use it for what it was 
designed for."

I can tow our boat behind, put a canoe on top, and drive in comfort down the highway. My kids and I love to take it off road. It really can go anywhere the tires can get traction. I have not had any breakdowns with it, however I do maintain my Range Rover religiously. If you are thinking of buying one of these make sure you get a certified Land Rover preowned with a complete warranty. They are very expensive to repair and maintain. My Range Rover is well worth the money- it is the most fun I have had with any vehicle, it can carry all my recreational toys with ease, go anywhere up mountains and through rivers, the kids love it, and it looks great too!"

It was a special edition, in which 25 were made (125 were planned, but 25 only made it out). I love the car, plan on driving it into the ground, however it still is a Range Rover. To begin with Rovers are not well known for their reliability. It isn't the question of whether you have a good one or a bad one, it is more like I have a bad one or a less bad one. So far during my ownership, I have replaced a fair amount, about $10,000 worth of work since new. I also know that since I came out of warranty, I need to put in about $4-5k. I would avoid a Range Rover and go Japanese, unless a Land Rover/Range Rover is a must have"

WORST! The first 2 years were fine ..

Don't let the extended warrany fool you.  You will spend 4 times the vehicle price to maintain the vehicle!  Don't ever buy a used Land Rover!  So many problems and not worth the headaches. Land Rovers are kind of like horses, the best two days you have them are the day you buy them and the day you sell them.  Get Ready for $1000 brake jobs every 8,000 miles.  Make sure you like the dealerships loaner car before you buy because thats what you will be driving most of the time.  Everyone of our landrovers has had MAJOR problems. Please don't make this mistake.  "
land-rover,range-rover,2000,CA Driver, 01/12/2004,Definitely NOT worth it,3,"Can't say too many good things about
this car.  Price comparison was similar
to an S-Class - should have bought the
S-Class!  Resale value is extremely poor
- it been less than 4 yrs and the
re-sale price has already dropped 60%. 
Can't even sell it if I want to - too
much of a loss!  Technology was really
old when I bought it compared to
available technology at the time. 
Unless you are into serious

VERY disappointed in fit/finish, quality, and warranty efforts for amount of money spent.  I am SURE it is off-road capable if you can suffer the repair work afterwards.  With only one dealer in most towns you are at their mercry.  Roadside Assistance?  A joke.  Rattles on a $60,000 car?  Sorry but not covered by warranty.  Wind noise?

Love the styling, but the reliability is horrible, resale value is pretty much zero. The electronics are so far outdated and the interior is still way behind others in the same class. I would never buy one again.  We thought our 745li was bad on reliability, but this thing is horrible.  Run and run very fast to something else. We traded it in for a loaded Lexus SUV and gosh what a difference!  Talk about creature comforts, yet still have towing and off road capabilities. The 745li is going to be dumped for a Lexus soon. "
land-rover,range-rover,2000,Apllw, 05/02/2007,Worst Car Ever Owned,3,The best day of owning this vehicle was the day we sold it. And even that was a loss. Vehicle was always breaking down. No heat on driver side. Brake job. Heated seats never worked. Driving around town I would get cramps in my arms from the effort it took to keep this vehicle driving straight. This vehicle was a gem to drive on vacation or long term trips- and the AWD was amazing.
land-rover,range-rover,2000,Mountain Man, 09/19/2005,Range Rover? In a heartbeat!,4,"This is a 5000 lb. truck, not a sedan. If you want a highway poseur stationwagon, buy something else. I've taken the RR camping in the mountains, & it simply goes wherever you point it; no drama. The only real competition for this vehicle is the Mercedes G-wagon, which rides like a tank on the road. I can go off-road with modified trucks, and cruise home on the highway like a limo. Absolutely, the BEST 4x4 by far! Find an independent shop that knows Rovers; only a fool would use a dealer for service!"
land-rover,range-rover,2001,Coolerking, 09/02/2010,Beauty and Beast,4,"I bought this to drive in comfort on the highway and never get stranded offroad. It excells at both. I hit a deer head-on at 65mph and was able to drive 80 miles home with all lights working and no steering problems-a very solid vehicle! Had the bladder leak on one of my suspension bags- replaced it with Gen III air bladders from Arnott and Bilstein shocks-now it's awesome squared! It's just a real pleasure to drive it anywhere. I want the most bang for my buck and I've got it with this. So far, except for more horsepower, the later model styles don't appeal to me as much as the P- 38. Turning radius and maneuverability is amazing. The first day I drove it I parallel parked it in ONE move! "
land-rover,range-rover,2001,wytex, 10/30/2013,Love/Hate Relationship,2,"I love the look and image of Land Rovers and Jaguars. The 2001 Range Rover that I purchased has had way too many problems, but it still has an appeal that makes me continue sinking money into to keep it rolling. The styling has a classic appearance that makes it's age irrelevant. I like to fly fish and this vehicle is a perfect match to my bamboo fly rod and Filson vest and waders. Once I reach 200K miles in this vehicle I will likely buy a newer Range Rover and go through the whole love/hate routine again.
--------
Several years have gone by and the Range Rover is still on the road.  It is a great off road vehicle and has worked well for our personal interest in Fly Fishing and Snow Skiing. We have given it plenty of chances to get stuck, but it seems to be up for any situation. Reliability is a continuous challenge and the gas mileage is poor. We now have 155,000 miles on the odometer and just got it out of the shop for $1,000.00.  We hope to get to 200,000 miles. Engine and transmission still doing well. A Range Rover is not for everyone. Sometimes I wonder why I still enjoy driving it. I guess it's because there is nothing else on the road like it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
It is now late 2018 and will provide more feedback. We still have the 2001 Range Rover and it has about 170,000 miles at this point. Within the last year we had repairs totaling about $2,500. It is running reasonably well but has a slew of minor/major irritations. We are still trying to get to 200,000 + miles and if/should we get there this will be our last Land Rover of any kind. Maybe this should be a warning. DO NOT buy a vehicle from this brand unless time and money is no object.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Hard to believe we still have this vehicle. We are even considering the purchase of a 2012 Range Rover SC to replace the 2001 RR. After all these years Range Rover still has a unique blend of qualities not found on any other vehicle.

land-rover,range-rover,2001,H, 06/03/2006,BestSUVin the World,4,"I have always admired the Range Rover from afar, and knew one day that I would have to get one. That day finally came and I must say that I love the Range.  I read people reviews and with any product your going to have the good with the bad.  The Range Rover is ""King of the Hill""  hands down. This SUV is in a class all by itself, case in point the next time you take that baby out for a ride count and see how many other Ranges you come across. You don't see them all over the place like the so-called- comparison SUV's BMW X5, Mercedes M- class, Cadiallac Escalade. You can pull up to the light and literally count about 3 BMW's and at least 2 Escalades. The Range reign supreme."
land-rover,range-rover,2001,Justin, 03/04/2016,BE..............................Aware!!!.......,1,"Possibly......No....... (it is) The worst vehicle I've ever come in contact with (my wife's truck). Thing was a ticking time bomb from the moment we purchased it. Wished I did more research on it before we bought it. She's always loved Range Rovers. I happened to be looking around on craigslist (probably the reason it was such a lemon to begin with) when I came across this nice 2001 HSE in (what seemed to be) good condition, with 110,000 miles on the odometer. Test drive (of course) went good. Truck started right up, shifted smooth, had plenty of power (thanks to that gas guzzling 4.6 V8), rode a little stiff but figured that was do to the air suspension and low profile tires. All seemed well, so we bought it and took it home. Maybe an hour goes by after its been parked from not being registered yet. Come outside and the front driver's side of the truck is dropped to the floor. Low and behold that infamous Range Rover air suspension (that I now know about). I should've been more worried about the up arrow (indicating an issue with the air suspension) on the cluster being illuminated but the fool (me being more of a fool) who sold it to us says ""I think it means its fully lifted"". So I look around online and see that the air bags are pretty cheap and somewhat easy to fix. They also refill and lift the truck after its running so I don't worry too much. I'll just do them myself when I have some time. About two weeks later, we drive the truck up to my father's house for a visit (1h 50m drive). All went well until it was time to go home. Started it up to let it warm up for a few minutes, then it randomly shuts down. Try to start it back up and nothing. It cranks but never fires. A couple minutes go by and it starts, but maybe 30 seconds later it shuts down again. At this point my wife is fed up with this thing since we just got it. I do a quick search on the forums and describe the issue. Crank position sensor is the culprit. We have it towed to a local mechanic my father goes to and luckily it was a pretty easy fix. All seems well again until the following weekend when the Mrs. goes out to the city with some friends. I get a call and she says ""the truck shut down, is in the middle of the street and is smoking very bad"". Now I'm completely pissed and ready to take this truck to a junkyard and get to crush it myself. I asked her if she noticed the temp gauge over in the red zone and she said ""yes"". Now I'm more worried since she doesn't know how long it was overheating before it shut down on her. She rarely pays attention to her gauges while driving. Her mother just so happened to be meeting up with her at the event her and her friends were going to so she wasn't alone since mom was nearby. A gentleman was walking by and helped pushed the truck off to the side of the road. Luckily she wasn't on the highway anymore but on a busy city street. After the smoke somewhat cleared he reveled one of the top radiator hoses came loose and popped off. I'm still home at this point since she said shes going to leave it where it is and her and mom are going to head to the event. Next day comes and we drive to where the truck is. I get the hose back together, fill the radiator with some antifreeze and we start on our way home. Not long after, its starts overheating again. I'll skip ahead since this story is already long enough. We eventually get it home from NY (we're in NJ) after repeatedly pulling over and stopping to let it cool off and refill. First thing I notice after getting it home is there is a huge hole in the Y connector pipe connecting two upper radiator hoses down to the lower radiator hose that also connects to the external thermostat housing (first design I've ever seen like that but whatever). Hole was more than likely a result from overheating. Anyways, get that replaced. Still overheating. Replace the thermostat, still overheating.
 Replaced the water pump (which was surprisingly easy), still overheating. I even go as far as drilling out the thermostat (from within the ridiculous housing that doesn't let you replace it the normal way) and running it straight open and the b**** is still overheating. All that trial and error and the head gasket was the cause from the beginning (which caused it to initially overheat and pop that hose loose). Antifreeze level was always good and wasn't leaking but hey I guess s*** happens, haha. All in all, maybe we just so happened to get a lemon and you'd never have those same issues. But after owning it and doing some extensive research, the bad faaaaaaaar outweigh the good with this truck. I remember one person even saying ""It should be illegal to sell this thing"". Sorry for the long story. I just wouldn't want anyone else to make the same mistake. If anything, buy one new and get a full lifetime warranty because apparently even the new ones are a big pain in the arse as well. You and your dealer will become very acquainted. Hope this story helps. ~peace~

But BE PREPARED for the maintenance costs-- they will kill your pocket--average visit to the dealership is about $2000- -and believe me this truck can go frequently of it wants to--the annual checkups range from about $1300-$1100 and are done every 15000 miles and there is always something extra to be done while in the shop.

Electrical system is a disaster. 3 times the car just died on me while driving my kids in our ""safe"" SUV.

land-rover,range-rover,2001,LA Rover, 10/18/2019,A joy to drive - worth the upkeep,5,"I absolutely enjoy driving this solid truck (body-on-frame) Mark II 4.6 HSE, P38 (“Pegasus” engineering block 38A), Bosh engine from BMW 7, with the solid-axle suspensions that made the RR king of the off-road, now discontinued after this model. Even my Prius driving husband loves being a passenger.

I’m a slight 5’4” woman, my visibility is awesome with numerous seat adjustments and massive window space, interior is sporty but luxurious (love the wood), great sound system, I feel in complete control driving Los Angeles freeways especially in the rain, and couldn’t live without the EAS that addressed the roll over issue. Had it totally replaced – no springs. I’m a dog performance enthusiast so going off road into the field with a 4-wheel drive is a pleasure. I lower it for my Labrador to hop in. Love the tailgate feature for unloading gear/stuff and sitting with friends at an event. 

IMO, the key ingredient is to find a mechanic you trust and enjoy working with. Someone that could rebuild this truck from the ground up. Mine is terrific. I was told to expect to put $2,500/yr into this vehicle. I purchased it just out of warranty with 60K mi? Currently at 132K (I have a home office. My mechanic says I need to get out more and drive it.) Took out an extended warranty which helped. I might be ahead of the game with cost. Did the headliner last year, and recently finally addressed the 3 oil leaks.
Ready for family road trips. 

I look every so often, but can’t find a compromial replacement. The LR4 with third seat would give more AC in the back for my dog, but hard to find with features and I’d be starting all over again with unknown issues. I just love the look and feel of my Rover.

It's an expensive vehicle to maintain, but it will not disappoint when its called to duty.  Yes, the vehicle has some quirks, but its something I have found in each vehicle I have owned.  Nothing is perfect, but this vehicle gets me and my family where we need to go regardless of the weather and most importantly it does it safely.

Besides the trips to the shop for maintanence it has been reliable. The door locks and windows will act up at times along with the check engine light. By the way the SRS light is ""haunted"", its goes off in warm weather. The engine and trans are perfect. The body is rugged and the interior still looks new.

Sturdy build quality, parts & paint keep her looking sweet and sexy, like the day she came off the truck. I bought it with 50k on it and now we're at 109k, nothing but routine maintenance. I bought the warranty through 100k and didn't use it once. I'm a true believer that if you take care of these Rovers, they'll last forever. My local shop says mine is one of the dryest underneath they've seen, for the mileage. "

It has had enough work to seem new still and rides like it.  It tows like a truck and during the worst Colorado winter on recent record was the only vehicle to get out of the neighborhood(including Hummers and a Ford f250 4 wheel drive). We have an SRX Caddy awd and an Audi w Quattro.  We keep the RR as a second car now, but, when it snows the Range is what my wife insists on having drives. It's quirky but gets the job done when we really need it.  "
land-rover,range-rover,2002,rockman, 07/11/2008,Better Buy Two,2,"Looking back, I should have bought 2 of these so I would always have one to drive while the other was in the shop getting repaired. It's great off road and reasonably comfortable on the highway. If I were to ever buy one again, not likely, I would sell it the day the warranty expired. Since the warranty expired about 3 years ago, I have averaged $3000/yr in repairs and I have all the receipts to show for it. Lastly, my RR leaks like a sieve when it rains and the dealer can't seem to find out from where.  I actually drilled a hole in the spare tire well to let the water drain out on its own so I wouldn't have to suck it out with a hose after every rain.  "
land-rover,range-rover,2002,Woody, 06/16/2005,Keep looking!,2,"Owned this vehicle one month.  Selling dealership was great, vehicle was horrible.  Many interior and exterior plastics fell off, loud transmission whine and clunk when upshifting, strange clicking noise from air conditioner, two bolts fell off onto the floor from the steering column (didn't know what they went to!), both door speakers fell off, had to glue them back in place, rear cargo light fell off, rubber door seals sagged letting water in when raining, and many other things I don't have space to write.  Vehicle was great on the test drive and the 5 hour drive home.  Nothing but problems ever since, traded the vehicle for a Porsche Cayenne and will never regret getting rid of it."

There Rover can go any where, if you need to go thru snow this the vehile. I looked at the Hummer H2, but it looked to cheat on the inside and just felt cheat.

It is over-priced and over-rated...I made my final payment on it in December..Today is January 20th, I am picking it up from the shop. The cost this time was $5500.00. I hate I bought this vehicle.."

Paid through the nose for an extended warranty (used some of it but, in general, it was a waste).  Car costs $1000 - $2000 per year to keep in good shape.  The BMW 7- series engine is fantastic and drives much better than newer HSEs with the Jaguar engine.  Transmission never hunts for the right gear like the Jag engine.  I replaced OEM tires with much better Goodyear HPs and the difference is amazing.  Much quieter and better handling.  The styling is great and the annual mechanical costs are worth it."

NOT been helpful in correcting these

Off-road:  Good but beware,  wheels go out 
of alignment extremely easily.  Even in city

Went to look at the LR3 and saw the new body style and knew of the partnering of BMW and Range Rover. It was all over after the test drive. The engine is the same as the one in the 7-series BMWs. Great pickup and when cruising feels like one is floating over the road. We purchased  the extended warranty to be safe re any major repairs. Overall the mechanical issues have been minor. Had one incident with the drivetrain yet all covered under the warranty. Have had one ""major"" service and was pretty costly. Overall very pleased and would buy again. Definitely would encourage buy the extended warranty"

I would be willing to pay more money for this truck if it were reliable but it isnt! The dealership that I take it to keeps it for 2 to 3 months when in for service.

They run the ""certified pre- owned"" crap making you think they will stand behind it. That's non-sense. From the minute I drove it off the lot it was nothing but a nightmare. Electrical issues became a daily routine. Lights flickering on and off. Then transmission issues of all things.

The HSE is wonderfully appointed and a prize to drive, but it is very temperamental and with over 60 engine sensors- the service engine soon light goes on every three months. To add to this, the labor and parts charges are a college tuition bill. A heavy SUV that burns through brakes every 20K.

begin to tell you how superior my new

completely different suv.  I owned a 
1997 a 2001 and now the spectacular 
2003.  The BMW technoloy is running 
through out the new suv.  It's 4x4 
capabilites are like no other.  The 
2003 gives you style and class.  When 
you need it the acceleration of the BMW 
designed V-8 will impress you.  I tow a 
6500lb boat.  The Range Rover takes 
this is stride with its 288 hp engine.

2003 Range Rover. After driving each

the 2003 Range Rover. It subjectively 
has ALL of the sophisticated electronic

characteristics, as well as most all of 
the convenience & luxury features that 
are found in even the FINEST sedans the

such a good quality feel to it (both 
inside, in the genuine wood - none of 
that cheesy Cadillac 50cent plastic 
fake wood) and in the way that it 
handles bumps.

It drives like a dream, and with the 
hyper-adjustable power seats & air 
suspension it just blows away every 
other SUV that I've owned or tested.  
I race SCCA showroom stock, so when I 
picked an SUV I judged it pretty 
harsh.  

I liked the interior room of my ML500, 
but the ML drivers seat is 
uncomfortable without lumbar or a 
usable armrest.

succeeded. I've been a BMW owner for 
years, and when I saw (and read) about 
the German engineering that contributed 
to the re-design of the third-
generation Range Rover I was intrigued. 
The BMW 4.4 liter V8 (tuned to the 
needs of the more weighty Rover than 
the 5 series) seems a plenty powerful 
match-up to the Rover. (Coming from the 
polar opposite ride, a 1997 M3, I can't 
be a good judge of handling, 
acceleration, etc. on comparison.) 
Actual fuel economy, reset for a 4-hour

I do take my RR off road and this on

My frind has a Lexus 470.  I used to

pleased with my choice then- especially
when I sw my neighbor with snow chains

the BMW fit/finish to my rugged ride.

I bought it with 103,000 miles on it but looked and drove 10 times better then one of my newer SUVd. I cant tell you how amazing and smooth the ride has been. Everyone over exaggerates repair and reliability problems but with a little bit of homework you can have things fixed easily. My left air strut died which is expected after 100k miles but easily found a refurbished one online and a month later my right air strut died as well and once again found and replaced it with a refurbished one. All I have to say is there are no amount of repair bills that could ever add up to the original MSRP and I saved over 70K!"
land-rover,range-rover,2004,reyes73a, 05/07/2015,The Best SUV I have Owned,5,I keep reading about people complaining about the build quality and reliability. That is all BS. We are talking about a car from 2004. Wait until the new 2015 models get reviewed 11 years from now and then we can compare who did better: Ford VS BMW.I bought it used with 77K and its been a wonderful car. I do all the maintenance myself and its actually quite cheap. I love to drive it. Gas mileage and outdated electronics are the two major setbacks for me. For highway driving gas mileage is good (25 mpg approx). The air ride its just great! People complain about the air suspension going out. The exact same thing happens on all +10yr old luxury vehicles that use it...
land-rover,range-rover,2004,pdxrover1, 06/04/2012,Pleasantly Suprised...A Gem,4,"We've owned this car for 3 years now. No major issues to speak of, must have gotten a good one. Only have 71k miles on it, but are looking forward to another 15k or so before upgrading to a newer model. 2004 is a great year with a fantastic engine made by BMW, not like later years where ford took over. Has never let me down reliability wise, took it to Alaska for a year, never slipped, got stuck, or had any kind of hesitation."

Comfort, the performance, the overall ride of the vehicle. I've been pleasantly surprised by the gas mileage. Not sure how I would measure by the gallon, but I will say that when I fill up for 75.00 a tank, I can go from central VA to North Jersey on one tank and still have some fumes left over. A full tank gets me roughly 476 miles total for highway driving. For my local 20 minute each way commute to the office and my around town stuff, I can get through an entire week on one tank. 
Due to lack of characters, I will need to continue in a seperate review."
land-rover,range-rover,2004,nutty123, 11/16/2013,Simply the best,5,"This is my 5th Range Rover and by far the best.
I still get that buzz every time I climb into the drivers seat. Comfort is absolutely outstanding, in fact there isn't a seat in the house that is as comfortable. 
The smooth gear change, build quality, and the envious looks you get from other drivers says it all.
Those little extras like heated steering wheel, parking sensors front and rear, and TV make it special. 
I have the LPG conversion which means that in real terms I get the equivalent of about 40 mpg which is amazing for a car of this size and quality.
Quite simply the best 4 x 4 in the world.

I have since bought the TDV8 Vogue 2007 and I didn't think it possible but it's even better.

land-rover,range-rover,2004,Mpanico2004RR, 05/19/2009,Transmission & Radiator Issues Beware,3,"For anyone buying a pre owned 2003-2005 Range Rover HSE, make sure that the radiator issues in the past have been corrected.  They fail and the electronic thermostat does not sense the overheating.  Thus, the radiator fails and the transmission overheats with zero warning. Over time, the tranny 50K on will eventually fail and cost you thousands to repair.  We are a loyal RR family owned 2 and one saved our friends life in a head on accident.

Road driving is also very smooth. The acoustics are a great thrill especially when connected to an Ipod. Trailer pulling was a pleasent surprise too! I didnt feel the car I was hauling behind me.

After I reached 60K it was downhill from there.
Had it in the shop countless times because of having to replace the suspension (which I converted to coil instead of replacing the expensive air suspension), had to replace the radiator twice, an alternator (because the coolant from the radiator that leaked caused it to malfunction), a fuel pump replacement, countless brake pad and rotor replacements, and top it off with hard-to-find tires.

Also when the brake pad sensors go off to tell you that they are worn, well that actually means that you'll need new rotors.  If the battery runs out when you leave your lights on, well it wont be able to be jumped by a tow truck slave and youll have to get a new $300 battery and new head gaskets (I guess they just wear out after 65K).

Hands down, this is the most unreliable car I've ever owned.  I bought it new in 05 and got the longest warranty they had.  I spent roughly 80k buying it, and including warranty work, over the past 13 years and 100,000 miles, this SUV has cost more to maintain than the cost of the car.  Yes, over 80k in service, and I have all the records.    Things started breaking right out of the gate - the nav screen, the air shocks, the waterpump, the transmission (which was fixed under warranty, but would have cost me 16k if it wasn't covered.  Things that had just been fixed broke over and over and over again within a year or two of being replaced.  At one point, the steering ""froze up' while driving, and I almost got in an accident.  I still own it, we use it as a farm car, it needs waaaaayyyyy too much stuff replaced to be worth fixing, but it still drives in 1st gear.  Wish I could tell you just my SUV was bad, two other family and friends had the same car from the 03-05 model years, and they reported almost EXACTLY the same problems.  Avoid one at all costs, unless it's free, and has extensive service records.  This SUV is the biggest piece of junk ever built.

I purchased the vehicle with approx. 68K miles and to my surprise it has been one of the most reliable vehicles I've ever purchased! Now I have ~109K miles on it a it runs just like it did the day I purchased it.  The only major cost was the front suspension.

land-rover,range-rover,2005,mscolej, 02/03/2010,Taking a Risk,3,"I took a bit of a risk on this one, 2005 RR with 90K, but I got such a great deal it was in such great shape that I could not refuse.  I have always admired these trucks and the ride is awesome.  I did get a warranty at a reasonable cost from warranties4wheels.  The 2005 seems to be put together better that the 03's and 04's I had driven and it was the last to have the BMW engine.  I have not seen any of the major issues or cost that others have seen and fingers crossed hopefully I won't the good news is it was such a good deal that I could spend a little and not be pissed."
land-rover,range-rover,2005,range rover hse, 12/07/2006,my rover,4,"This truck is a looker.  People often compliment me on my purchase.  However, it has more than its share of mechanical defects and glitches.  Part of the problem, I believe, is there are just too many cute electronic gadgets.  Thus more things that can go wrong.  I have just over 60k miles and have already replaced a major portion of my transmission.  (under warranty)  I don't think this is acceptable.  If you are looking for a conversation piece, this is it.  If you are looking for economy and reliability, not here!"
land-rover,range-rover,2005,Range Rover, 09/28/2010,Looks are very deceiving,2,Real quick review: this SUV is beautiful but the maintenance is very poor. I have owned for over 3 years and have been in the dealership service department as if I worked there. I don't know if its the manufacturer or the technicians but there is always an issue. If you have time or money to waste this SUV is right for you. I highly recommend purchasing extended warranty. 
land-rover,range-rover,2005,DaTB, 10/01/2009,Don't believe the (negative) hype,4,"We bought this truck a few years ago as a b-day present to replace my husband's aging '01 RR 4.6 HSE. After buying several brand new and slightly used cars, I decided upon a pre-owned, still-under-warranty '05 RR (which is THEE way to go since you let others pay $30k more for the same vehicle to determine if it's solid, or a lemon). And this beast is one impressive machine: it's amazingly torquey and can induce whiplash if you've got a heavy foot, it has a cavernous interior, gigantic, ultra-comfortable seats, intuitive and well laid out touch screen, insane, gale-force A/C, and unsurpassed build integrity. But, it is anemic at speeds above 30mp & could use a few more tech features. Love it!"
land-rover,range-rover,2005,DaTB, 05/11/2009,Rodeo Drive meets the Rubicon,4,"We traded in our 2001 Range Rover for a newer model & we found that certified pre-owned is THEE way to go: you have the vehicle's service history to see if it's a lemon, & we got roughly $35k off the original sticker price. HUGE comfotable seats, both front and back. The height of the driving position is captivating because you feel so in control of not only the vehicle, but all those around you as well. Integration of center console with the dash and the rest of the vehicle is beautiful. Super torquey engine that pins you to your seat but struggles at higher RPMs to haul this monster. This truck rides with more refinement than our previous '02 745i! Storage is ENORMOUS! Highly recommended!"
land-rover,range-rover,2005,George, 01/29/2005,Worst vehicle I have ever owned,1,"Throughout my life I have owned many high class vehicles and this is by far the worst vehivcle I have ever owned. It has more problems then can be listed in this 700 word review. Among some of the many problems were incidents such as disabled suspension, steering column failure, being locked in the vehicle, the windows mysteriouslty going down over night, the security alarm dosen't work, and Land Rover North America refusing to take responsbility for all these problems and admit ITS A LEMON. In short I would not recomend this car to anyone I personaly am getting rid of mine and purchasing an Audi A8L."

land-rover,range-rover,2005,Nautictalk, 03/25/2005,I LOVE MY NEW RR,4,"I had some terrific cars in the past.  I originally bought a MB convertible.  But when my son got a RR, I had to have one too.  It is so refined in everyway, and is lightyears from a 1996 model I once owned.  It's  fun and comfortable.  I had one minor squeak which was fixed in 5min at the dealership.  I really baby this car.  When BMW made this car, they knew what they were doing.  I hope Ford doesn't screw it up.  In my opinion, and for panache, the RR is more impressive than the Lexus and more fun to drive.  Drives surprisingly smooth. They could do a bit better with the rear storage.  Buy it and you won't be sorry."
land-rover,range-rover,2005,teamyonex, 06/23/2005,Perfect blend of Land Rover and BMW,4,"Purchased in May as dealer was anxious to clear inventory for '06s.  1% over invoice.  Wife drives a BMW 5-series, and the connection between the RR and BMW is unmistakable.  Very tight build.  13.7mpg overall.  Rear facing sight lines aren't that great due to pillar and head rests, which could be an issue for some.  Awesome stereo.  Plenty of acceleration for my tastes.  Considered a Cayenne S, but decided against it due to rear leg room.  RR is 7"" longer, and is much more comfortable in the back.  Aerodynamics are strange: water pools on hood even at 70mph, and rear end has an updraft that gets it dirty in about 5 seconds.  But a fine vehicle, one that I'll be hanging onto for a long time."

It is equal to sitting in a barcalounger and the view out the windows is your tv.  It is one of the smoothest vehicles that I drive.  I travel 11/2 miles on dirt road, and you would never know I have left the pavement.  I have had a few unusual mechanical problems; however the dealership has taken  great care of me.  Will most likely buy a 2006 or 07."

land-rover,range-rover,2005,Robert, 07/08/2005,Best in the world!!!,5,I have owned many SUV's!!! All imports. I had a cayenne for a very short time and an X5 for 2 years. I liked the BMW better than the Porsche but the Range rover has surpassed them both. I looked at these new redesigned models in 2003 and almost pulled the trigger but ended up with the BMW. It was fine but they are a little too common. I wanted something Big and comfortable with a timeless style. I think the Rover really fits the bill. This is the first purchase of a SUV...I have always leased in the past but I want to keep this one for a long while. It has everything I need. I was saddened to see someone trading off for an A8l...it is just a car afterall and audi is hammered on resell.

Well, most SUV's have that problem.  This vehicle is very reliable and very safe.  As a fun vehicle for children.  I would like to put back the ""James Bond"" feature which allowed you to use audio tapes by pushing a button to turn back the navigation screen which hid the tape dec.  I have audio books for my children which do not come in CD form. "
land-rover,range-rover,2005,W Winegar, 06/24/2005,Great Touring and Mountain Car,4,"We bought this to handle tough snow and mountain driving and long-distance higway travel in all weather conditions.  The 2005 Range Rover w/its strong BMW engine is by far the most comfortable and responsive vehicle for our needs.  We looked at the LX470, but too big; the Cayenne, too small; the Toureg, small and hard ride.  The heated front/rear seats on the Range Rover are a real plus for cold nights and loved by our dogs and guests.  We use every accessory and all the driving enhancment controls like hill descent, low range 4-wheel, etc., and trust them all.  A perfect vehicle for mountain and highway. Get the mega adjustable seats and leather dash.  Awesome."

2002, a BMW X5 4.6 2003, I moved to a
2004 Range Rover.  A big improvement
over previous model(owned a 2000 Range
Rover) and the BMW design and running
gear provide the performance for a high
end SUV.  Best is the comfort and
ability to handle towing needs,and get
up and go when required.  Off road
capabilities exceed most if not all
needs of the average user. A very
comfortable four passenger SUV/Sedan."

quality! The 5k pricetag for the
upgraded interior seems steep but is
worth the price .Handles great and is a
pleasure to drive."
land-rover,range-rover,2005,jed, 12/29/2004,Very satisfied,4,"I've looked for a new car for over two 
years. I wanted an sport utility 
vehicle and looked and drove the 
Mercedes (too small and minivan 
looking), the BMW X5 (too generic), the 
Lexus LX (poor steering response and 
marginal quality of some of the 
interior items), and the Lexus GX (too 
small and common). Waiting for the 2005 
Range Rover was definitely worth it. 
The style, build quality, and smooth 
ride are worth the wait. Power is good, 
particularly in the high end. The new 
navigation system and voice activated 
telephone (using Bluetooth) are 
excellent and intuitive with any 
technical background. The ride is the 
best thing about the new RR, smooth 
with stiff and responsive steering."
land-rover,range-rover,2005,tony, 12/31/2004,SUV/Luxury,4,"I LOVE my Range Rover.  I initially had 
a bad experience.  I bought my new 
Range Rover in 9/04 and within 1 week 
had issues with the steering.  After 
several (3) attempts to repair, Land 
Rover could not fix the issue with the 
steering.  I insisted that it needed to 
be exchanged and with a bit of help 
from Land Rover Corporate, I was given 
a brand new Rover at no cost.   

I love my new Range Rover and it 
performance is outstanding.  I now 
understand why people love the vehicles 
so much.  I was a Mercedes/BMW luxury 
driver before but, now I feel like I 
have the best of both worlds.  I just 
hope Jaguar doens't ruin it in 2006."

land-rover,range-rover,2005,chebli, 10/22/2006,beautiful car,4,this truck sound and ride like a car. very elegant and sufficient car.loaded with premium navigation system
land-rover,range-rover,2006,Justin Woodall, 02/07/2016,The Dichotomy of Land,4,"You'll love it, & probably buy it, for the obvious reasons; style, class, comfort, luxury, utility, & the jealousy factor.  But, in specific the leather, info touch screen, Harmon-Kardon stereo, & all options of the luxury interior package (an absolute must).  

You will grow to love the driveability, ride, & handling.  If you have the guts to try it, being so expensive, the off road capability of the Range Rover is amazing.  I sell ranches in Texas.  I can sell properties that others can't in my Rover.  Turn the suspension nob & lift the Rover 3 inches. It will now traverse the most challenging terrain with ease, & without feeling like it.  It's the love child of a Jeep & a Mercedes sedan.

You will HATE the repair bills!  In 4 years or so, both front airbags failed (although, I love the feature) rendering it undriveable, a door handle broke, sun roof jammed, & the nav map stopped working (I just ejected the disc!).  

I suggest finding a expert Land Rover guy near you (NOT THE DEALER!).  The dealer wanted $3k for each airbag, $1k for the door, $1k for Sun roof, & $500 for the nav map, that's $8,500!  It still cost me $3k with my non-dealer guy.

The 255 55 R19 tires are very expensive & the selection sucks.  Also, it has the most expensive battery I've ever seen.

Overall, the 2006 Range Rover HSE is an awesome vehicle.  Just remember, if you buy one be prepared to drop $5k for repairs at anytime.

land-rover,range-rover,2006,Primal28, 08/04/2006,Overpriced,1,"I began having problems immediately after purchasing the vehicle. The most dangerous problem was the lunging and hesitation (dealership claims it was a software / programming issue). I have experienced near death 5 times now! The navigation, radio, blue tooth & voice recognition malfunctioned and some were never repaired, just disconnected by the dealership. The car was lemon-lawed (hauled off on a flatbed trailer 3 weeks ago) and I still have not received my settlement payment as Land Rover has conveniently misplaced the paperwork. I'm still making $1,000 a month car payments and riding a bicycle around town."

Car was originally returned under California 'Lemon Laws' for a continuing computer error the dealer couldn't solve. Land Rover took it back, fixed the problems (whatever that was) and we ended up with it. Now, with nearly 80K miles, it still drives and rides wonderfully. Very comfortable. We are looking into getting our next Range Rover. "

It has the perfect combination of luxury, class, smooth and solid ride, power, sturdiness, quiet cabin, rides high, family size, storage, safety, etc., etc., etc.   Couldn't ask for more...  At 110k and going strong, luckily, I have had very few problems with this RR.

land-rover,range-rover,2006,Ash , 05/14/2005,2005 Range Rover,4,Owned this car for almost 3 months. My second of New Generation Range rover. Quality issues seems improved in comparison to the 2003. Luxury seating package made a huge difference in offering more comfort. New integrated phone system is a great feature and I just enjoy safer driving. Nav system is a great improvement. 2005 seems tighter than 2003. It's just a great SUV. I only wish it had more leg room in rear seat.
land-rover,range-rover,2006,Gem Elliott, 03/20/2016,Money pit,2,"These types are only good for one thing and that's leasing.  Make sure to get out of this vehicle by the time the warranty is up.  The engine works well but all of the peripherals along with electronics are suspect.  Also the air suspension will fail around 80K miles.  The dealer freely admits to this.  Each corner is $1500 to repair.  So you'll end up spending about $6,000 on all for corners at some point.  Then you will most likely get the dreaded steering column lockout.  This is actually a safety feature that eventually craps out.  Replacing this unit with a new one is $6,000.  If you're smart you can get a salvage unit for around $1200 and then spend another $500-700 on installation or try doing it yourself.  Of course that's if you get one that works to begin with.  The car's electronics are also very temperature dependent.  Here in Chicago it suffers from many cold related ailments.  The rear trunk section will get loose and will need to be rebuilt at some point before 100K miles.

My 06 RR HSE is great car to look at and drive, but the build quality and 'issues' really do bug me.  As a professional software engineer I would be ashamed to ship a product that clearly hasn't been finished and tested properly.  The Sirius satellite radio doesn't display the correct station information when you next start the car.  Already has a new audio control unit after 2000 miles because last one kept dying...dealer fiddled with it, but eventually had to replace the unit.  STILL have a rattle in the car which dealer can't find!  I will probably get an 07 RRSC but be aware of quality issue's if you want to get a RR."

We read the reviews on the 2006 just like you're doing, and people seemed to like the vehicle, so we traded.  I'm sorry for that stupid decision. At least the '04 was decent with the BMW drive.  Our '06 is an electronics monster that reared its ugly head when we drove off in it. We've had nothing but trouble with it. They've reprogrammed it and installed software upgrades 12 times and it still surged, shook, vibrated, cut in and out on its own. They can't fix it.  We gave up and bought a Mercedes.

land-rover,range-rover,2006,mike Marshall, 04/08/2017,Bought this junk to prove my daughter wrong 4/8/17,2,"Admittedly bought this 2006 RR with 135K miles in mint condition, 2 owners, proper maintenance ONLY because my 17 year old daughter is a car lover like her dad but knew RR's were horrible in quality and reliability and very expensive to work on. So, against my better judgement bought this RR. Within the first 2 weeks one of the front air suspension struts blew out. Cost $800 to repair. Basic oil change was $150. Front brakes due for replacement but British mechanic says CANNOT TURN RR ROTORS SO ONLY NEW ONES AVAILABLE. Got suspicious of this mechanic so took to my regular mechanic who simply put on after market brake pads, but still cost way less (still $250) than the $800 the ""British Mechanic"" repair shop was trying to soak me for. Rear view camera works about 25% of the time. SUV sits up so high with no running boards or handles on front pillar that very difficult to get in or out for us shorter people and puts heavy wear and tear on sides of both front seats creating upholstry tears and paint wearing off plastic trim parts that are very cheaply made. Even the rubber key was so worn it barely worked=poor design and material usage and they are $400 to buy and have programmed!  After 2 weeks and $1000 in repairs with more to come on those expensive air bags suspension ($800 PER wheel!) I decided to sell it. After driving a 2001 Lincoln Navigator which was of average quality, I would choose the Lincoln for less expensive repairs for both labor and parts. I myself bought a 2008 Infiniti QX56 SUV with 119K miles and cannot say enough good things about this SUV in EVERY category. It is a FAR superior SUV to the RR in EVERY way (and all others that I tested/researched). The RR's are currently the ""cool SUV"" to drive thus my young daughter's lust for it but knew it was going to be a mistake as is the case with most English cars. (owned a 99 Jag XJ8 for 5 years=huge repair bills done all at under 69K miles!) Owned an 86 Bentley Mulsanne for a year just for fun but just after one minor repair it costs $2000, so got that out of my car loving system. English make some beautiful cars but some of the most unreliable and expensive to work on. Got disgusted with American cars as well despite trying to ""be American, buy American"" but quality still not where it should be at any of the Big 3. Finally broke down and bought a Japanese car, something I swore I'd never do as they have always been so UGLY but many have finally figured out how to actually make a car look nice looking. If you want a really nice HUGE comfortable, powerful, high tech SUV. Def. try the Infiniti QX56 with almost 400 ft lbs of torque it does zero to 60 in 7 seconds, rides like a big Cadillac sedan in the comfort area and lots of room for hauling things when needed. Even my 17 year old daughter loves it, esp. with the technology upgrade package (BOSE, Nav, rear view camera, rear entertainment) and the roar of the factory exhaust is quite nice as well. One of the nicest cars I've ever owned and have  had almost 100 cars over the years.  Stay away from RR's unless you want to spend a lot of time at the repair shop spending ungodly amounts of repair money. Heck, I don't even like the looks of it! Too top heavy on windows making it look like a ""green house on wheels"" and interior is  WAY to small for serious Costco trips, minimal storage, many cheap parts at dash/console areas as well, esp for the high price that is charged when new. When driving it, it reminded me of driving something out of the 80's. Very outdated. Power is just average, esp. when compared to my former Lincoln Navigator and ESP. the Infiniti.  And note** your car insurance will increase significantly compared to other same year or older SUV's like Lincoln Navigator being that RR's are so expensive to repair. I got a $600/yr increase in premiums ""just because it was a RR"" according to my AAA rep.  Sold the RR
 within 3 weeks just to save my money and sanity! ""It pays to be cool"" but I ain't no fool! Sold the RR and got her an 2007 Infiniti FX35 which is also far superior to the RR in every way except the view height of sitting high in the RR.

land-rover,range-rover,2006,e owen, 02/08/2017,My second 06 rover,5,"I have owned two of these cars in the last 10 years,  about 3-4 years each and both experiences were wonderful! The first had a failed suspension at about 95k mile and that was the worst thing to happen to either. Finding an independent mechanic that understands these cars is key to maintaining them economically ...  I purchased the first off a three year lease with about 25k miles and drove it to 100k. I paid 34,000 and sold it four years later for 19k. The second had 60k miles, paid 21,000 and it currently has 130k miles. If I sell it for 8000.00, and  add all the maintenance cost and depreciation, my total cost of ownership not including fuel and insurance will be under 430.00 per month or .26 per mile.  I think these are great numbers for any car let alone a high end lux mobile... My daughters Prius has not done as well ( but way better on gas).  If I ""just got lucky"", I got lucky twice since my first 06 had similar numbers even with the suspension fix. I also averaged just over 20 mpg on the highway! I love these cars... Ive also owned a 1990, 95  Range Rover (really bad) a 2001 disco and a 2005 sport (both bought new) and I can say that the 06 range rover is by far the best of the lot from my experience, and one of the best  vehicles I've owned (136 and counting).

land-rover,range-rover,2006,Brian R., 05/11/2010,Good to GO,4,"Have always liked the styling, but never wanted to buy the 90's RRs for fear of build quality. Got a good deal and needed a winter vehicle. Had a LandCruiser previously and the RR gets much better gas mileage; more comfortable ride as well. Really enjoy the unique styling. I have only had normal maintenance so far, brakes, rear bushing, oil, winter tires, etc. The dealership is a little pricy, but not much more than Toyota. I put snow/all seasons on this winter and it performed flawlessly. I have owned 2 e320's, an XJR, a landcruiser, an acura CLS, a grand cherokee, and a cts-v. The interior build quality is the best I have ever seen or owned. And this is coming from a car guy. "
land-rover,range-rover,2006,Gulfvet66, 08/26/2006,No comparison,4,"Everyone looks at you differently than if you were driving Lexus (ho-hum, been there done that)  Best looking large SUV ever made.  Gorgeous color combinations.  Averaged 22 hwy when in cruise control.  Nav is simple, sound system is amazing.  Harmon Kardon 715 watts, Logic 7?  Stop it!!!"
land-rover,range-rover,2006,Champ214, 03/16/2009,Finest Lux Vehicle on the Planet?,4,"I love my supercharged RR.  It's silver over ivory with piano black trim, very sexy combination.  The ivory leather requires constant attention but looks great.  It's very nice leather btw.  Off the line acceleration is rather gradual, but once it's rolling, it pulls very strong.  I am averaging about 9.5 mpg which is acceptable for a vehicle this powerful and heavy.  I looked at the Benz S550 and prefer the ride, drive, and style of the Range Rover.  The only vehicle I can think of that combines ride quality, style, luxury, and class the way the RR does is the Bentley Flying Spur."
land-rover,range-rover,2006,David S, 03/26/2009,Range Rover,2,"There is no doubt that the Range Rover (RR) is the best looking SUV, but it is far from the best SUV.  In fact, it just may be the worst.  When you hear the rumors about the high level of frequency that the RR needs maintenance, believe them.  One of the most frustrating attributes of ownership is having an $80,000+ vehicle needing to go in for service every 3 or 4 months.  Not only that, but the service department at the dealerships are expecting the maintenance.  There are no apologies or concessions offered.  I feel that the time spent and the frustration used while owning this vehicle is highly unwarranted.  "
land-rover,range-rover,2006,YellowFever, 12/27/2009,Always amazing,4,"This is my 3rd Land Rover. I owned the Discovery I, a 2000 Range and now this. I love them all. They never cease to amaze me. You feel like a King in this thing. On road it handles like a sedan, off road (yes I use it for what it was made for) you can go anywhere. The Range Rover design has always been classic. No over abundance of plastic looking parts like the Asian SUV's. No crazy body lines to take away from the Land Rover look. Just pure and simple. The new Jag engine is plenty fast. The 6 speed trans helps out. Especially compared to my 2000 4.6 Range. Reliability issues, yea it has some but who cares. They are worth it to drive this car. Did I say you feel like a KING in this SUV?"
land-rover,range-rover,2006,salyg, 12/27/2005,A lemon,3,My husband purchased this car as a gift. It was a lemon. The engine was cutting off. They added a chip. Altitude problems they said. The navigation system went insane. Another chip was added. The radio got stuck on a single station and woul not turn off. It finally got fixed. the computer system was changing commands by itself...... the car was more at the shop that with us. Finally we got a new car through trade assist. We have has this one for 3 weeks. Engine light came on the other day. they said it was nothing. We will see...
land-rover,range-rover,2006,Sultan, 01/16/2007,Great car all over,5,"I bought this car based on an SMS message from the dealership, stating they have a special year-end offer. I saw the car first at the begging of 06 and it caught my heart but the price was over my budget. But with the new offer I could not resist. The dealer didnt have a test drive vehicle. So I bought the car anyway based on research done on the net,especially this site. I noticed a lot of reviewers complying of fuel consumption. To me its not a problem because I live in the middle east and gas is cheaper than tap water (you are more than welcome to move here &#61514;). I fill up a full tank for $20.  I recommend this car to any one with class and at the same time has some coolness left in them"
land-rover,range-rover,2006,hsm, 01/20/2007,Disappointed Again,3,"This was the Range Rover to make amends for the RR problems of the past.  It seems it is not to be.  Since buying new, I've had repeated problems with ""check coolant"" light, oil service reminder that would not reset and now a ""Suspension System Fault"" that they cannot seem to fix (Land Rover's build problem, my dealer is great).  The alarm signal sounds, the message light says drop speed below 30 mph.  I think I'm done with Land Rover, the is the second lemon I've had in three model years. Designed well and fun to drive, just don't go too far...the reliability is not what it should be for a car in this price range."

land-rover,range-rover,2006,New RR Lover, 10/17/2007,Really Nice Car,4,"Bought my RR used with 22K miles. It was a ""Factory Reacquired"" vehicle, better known as a manufacturer's buyback. I waited for 2,000 miles to write this review to make sure I gave an accurate response.  This is a really nice vehicle. The ride is a dream and I feel so safe in it.  I have the rear entertainment and satellite radio and both work well.  The reason for the buyback was a check engine light that would not go off for the previous owner.  Land Rover fixed the problem and gave an extra 12 months and 12,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty (minus a $100 per instance charge) so I thought for the price I would take a shot.  I couldn't be happier."

land-rover,range-rover,2006,John, 07/18/2007,The worst car I've ever owned!,2,"I love the look of the Range Rover and it's very capable off road.  Asside from that, this is the most unreliable and frustrating car I have ever owned.  I will never buy another one.  My service advisors tell me they are ""known electrical problems"" that they can not fix.  Eventually you give up on constantly taking the car back in and live with the headaches."
land-rover,range-rover,2006,itzsyk, 10/08/2006,awesome machine,5,"I just recently bought the 2006 Range Rover Supercharged a week ago. I didn't have the patience to wait for the 2007 model in november, so I got the car off the show room. I got the Chawton White/Ivory with Piano Black Trim and I love the clean look it has. Whenever I sit in the driver's seat I always have a smile on my face because you know you're probably the only person on the road with this car. The way this car just rides and steers just amazes me all the time. This car, even though it's a bit expensive, will satisfy your car needs in every way. It also rides better than my MBZ S500 4Matic."

land-rover,range-rover,2006,Ash, 06/26/2010,Old & Reliable,4,"I have about 53,000 miles and it's exactly 4 years in just a few weeks. We also owned a 2006 LS430 Lexus during the same period. Our RR outperformed the Lexus in reliability & comfort. We no longer needed 2 vehicles and we dumped the Ls 430 without a second thought. Kept up with the maint. and the car is running great. My only issue is the early wear and tear on the seats. You can thank our environmental wackos for that as the process for finishing(dyeing) the leather is not what it used to be because of some crazy environmental hazards. The new finishing process causes early wear and tear issues as explained by a number of upholsterers. We are enjoying every mile we drive this awesome vehicle."
land-rover,range-rover,2006,ru4god2, 09/10/2008,Only 2 Days Old,4,"Been wanting a full sized RR since 1989. When i saw the price drop on the 2006 models, I searched high and low to find the white w/sand I wanted. No frills, no heated seats, no entertainment, no luxury package, just the base line RR. I bought it certified with only 27k on it. So far, I can't stop grinning. Every time I look at it and hop in, I still can't believe it's mine. Finally. Audio system is a little clunky. Why so many different screens to perform simple functions? And the controls are a little out of arms reach (and I've got 35"" arms.) Some of the materials on the interior are cheap feeling (plastic) but that's all I can think of...."
land-rover,range-rover,2006,WB, 10/08/2009,A pleasant surprise,4,I am very happy with this vehicle and surprised with the mpg -- I have been averaging about 17.5 MPG.  Not sure how those getting under 10 are driving... Like any lux car it will need to be maintained but so far after 16 months the car has been very solid. So many opinions expressed about poor reliability that I want to express the opposite.   Interior comfort is very high with comfort seats.  Ride on the highway is solid and extremely comfortable on long trips.  It is a truck so it doesnt corner like my old BMW but this car will go anywhere.  Plus the truck is great to look at.  Highly recommended!
land-rover,range-rover,2006,New Owner, 08/17/2005,Rang Rover HSE,4,"I had the misfortune of owning a first gen Discovery which I traded in for a wonderful Lexus LX470.  The LX470 was my favorite ever but this Range Rover is very cool and definitely a competitor for the best ever.  Love the Lux Package comfort, Nav Unit and Integrated Bluetooth Phone.  Nice SUV.  A little pricy at the Dealer.  Saved from $84,000 MSRP to $68,750 on E BAy! 2000 miles!"

The power and ride of the Supercharged is a vast improvement on an already great truck!  The subtle styling changes are beautiful.  The luxury interior is relaxing and refined.  The power is unbelievable.  Range Rover did an incredible job.  The difference in price between the base and Supercharged is worth every penny!
land-rover,range-rover,2006,martin thomas, 10/09/2005,RR supercharged - wow,4,"Having driven diesel landrovers for 3 years to drive a s/c V8 beast was just fantastic. Acceleration is phenominal and you can quickly exceed national speed limits without noticing. Going around corners fast is somewhat an experience with such a large vehicle, but stopping power is really good (thank goodness). Fuel consumption is hideous with a max overall of 15 mpg and a town drive of around 11mpg. Best I ever got was 22 on a motorway. But what the hey! the overall drive is just fantastic, sometimes I just pull away flat out just to listen to the V8, even pulled a coach off the road once, surprised me too.  Performance is supreme, consumption terrible, but if you can affordone, go for it"

land-rover,range-rover,2006,Barry, 02/13/2006,Emasculated Range Rover,4,"We recently traded our 2003 RR for the new '06 RR.  This may have been a mistake.  The biggest complaint has been in the drive train.  The '03 RR was based on a BMW V8 from the 740 series.  It had 286 hp.  The car always seemed to have ample power and acceleration, no matter where you were in the RPM curve.  The new '06 is based on a Jaguar/Ford V8.  The spec sheet says 305 hp.  Frankly, I don't think the engine puts out half that much.  It feels anemic, has no pull through the gears.  When you finally make the transmission kick-down, the gears seem to have the wrong algorithm.  Land Rover probably couldn't afford the price of the BMW powerplant now that it is a Ford company.  I miss my '03."

The bluetooth telephone system connected easily with my iPhone and provided good call clarity (people are mostly unaware that I'm speaking with them on the handsfree system).

Yes, it does have a few reliability issues but my friends who have 2009 and newer have 0 problems but paid 75k. The pros outweigh the cons. If you are thinking about buying 1, do it!!

As long as Land Rover maintains the current level of quality control, I will never drive anything else.  The styling goes without saying, only surpassed by drive responsivness and passeger comfort.  Often labelled a gas guzzler, it is no more so than any other SUV in its league.  There is a reason the current Range Rover has become an icon.  It is just that good."
land-rover,range-rover,2007,OC Driver, 09/27/2009,"30,000 mile review",4,"I originally leased this vehicle for 30 months for a monthly cost of $1,375 (CA tax). The lease just expired and I bought the car (Chase financing 60 months $840 a month). I had owned Mercedes (E and S class)for 10 years and was nervous about getting into a LR. This has honestly been the most reliable and fulfilling vehicle I have ever owned (which is why I bought out the lease). I've had two problems:  electric mirrors got out of alignment (five minute fix) and driver side seat wiring failed (two day drop off). Service experience (Land Rover Newport Beach) is a joy - quick in/out - local Mercedes service was a good hour from drop off to rental car.  I am very happy!  "

I only had 2 minor problems with the car: front passenger headlight was fogging up during rain (dealer replaced it under warranty) and the steering wouldn't auto-decline to preset position when you start the car once in a while (dealer reset the computer and no problems after that)."
land-rover,range-rover,2007,David, 08/03/2007,Third time is the charm,4,"Bought an 03-had problems, bought an 05-it was a better vehicle. Just bought the 07 and I think Land Rover finally got it right. The new suspension is noticeably tighter with less body roll around corners and the new seats ""hug me"" better than my other 2 RR's. Also considered the MB S550 4matic, although it's comparing apples and oranges, I felt the RR offered similar luxury with more overall safety for my family. My only complaints are that the still too complicated radio/nav system is located too far away from the driving position, although I'm 6'2"" the stretch is uncomfortable. And the back- up camera picture quality is terrible. I'd also like to see a diesel option."

Of course dealers say they are not fogged when you take it in. So take pictures!"

There are all of the nice things that you expect on a RRSC, but hold on to your hats if you expect all of the bells and whistles to actually work.  Expect multiple computer failures and electronics not to work properly.  Plan on knowing your service manager on a first name basis.  When everything works, there is no better."

land-rover,range-rover,2007,Chris from Colorado, 08/22/2007,My Short-Lived Range Rover Experience,3,"I ordered a 2008 RR Supercharged but walked away after test driving it. One of the lower body panels was loose and pertruding; the passenger seat fan was noisy and obstructed, restricting airflow; and there were dirty smudges in numerous places on the white headliner. On a previous brand new RR that I test drove 3 doors had black wood trim and the 4th door had walnut wood trim--where is the quality control on these vehicles? I was also disappointed that Land Rover's $93K flagship didn't come with common options like: keyless entry/engine start, rear window shades; active headlights, and a power liftgate. For me, the aura of exclusivity faded fast after my Range Rover experience."

I am forced to compare this vehicle to the 07 Escalade AWD that I owned. As far as comfort goes - the Rover is more comfortable for the front passengers, but not as comfortable for the rear passengers as the Escalade. This is mainly due to the lack of being able to recline or adjust the rear seat. As far as driveability - the Rover wins hands down. The Escalade would toss the occupants left and right through corners - the Rover is very solid. As far as power - even though the Escalade boasts 400+hp - I feel they are very close in power."

I have had some problems - electrical (trapped wires when fitted).  This led me to buyer's remorse.  Once reunited all was forgiven and forgotten. Fuel ecomomy is hopeless (ave 15.8mpg) but Im past caring - I love the driving position. I love the comfort (solid ride).  Love the back up camera. Rear seats are small for passengers and trunk doesnt hold that much.  Who cares - love is blind! Although dont buy black - nightmare to keep clean!
land-rover,range-rover,2008,Lenny Ferguson, 04/15/2016,"So far, so good!",5,"I researched for months before buying my 2008 Range Rover HSE. I was worried about reliability reviews but there wasn't any other vehicle I wanted. I finally took the plunge and bought an 08 with 105k miles for $17k. I have to say I have been very impressed so far! My other car is a BMW 530i and the driving experience is very different (of course) but the Range Rover has such great character and comfort! I love it so far! I've put about 4000 miles on it in the first 6 weeks and it has averaged 19 miles per gallon with premium gas. My advice is to scrutinize the service history and always get a professional pre-purchase inspection! I nearly bought an 08 supercharged after the test drive, but the pre-purchase inspection showed it needed over $5k in work! Definitely worth the $150 inspection!

Apparently, I am fortunate in that I have never experience any major maintenance issues.
My only complaint is the $100+ it takes to fill it, but that goes with the territory.
These vehicles are fantastic in all conditions.
I live in the midwest and drive about 30,000 miles per year, so I see my share of nasty conditions including blizzards, ice and torrential rain.
I never worry if I am in the Range Rover.
Keep good tires on the car and it will get you there safely and effortlessly. Regarding interior finish and comfort, it doesn't get better, except on the newer RR's. Buy this vehicle....you won't regret it!"

Next problem occured while on interstate as power decreased while in fast lane.  Supercharer pump and electrical problem. Unfortunately, dealer where Rover was purchased went out of business and car must be sent 70 miles to nearest dealer.

Third time, I had to insist them to do a proper check and they found that there were residue in the transmission oil. They changed the full transmission (at least this is what they said) and released the vehicle after keeping it for 10 days. Was driving good for 3 months and then came the problem again.

But, living in AZ, we have taken it off-roading a few times. Very capable as that was what the car was built for.  It's too bad that most of these don't leave the pavement and parking lots, owners don't know what they're missing.

Car is rock-solid - like driving a vault, very BMW-esque.  It feels heavy (and makes my larger GMC Yukon seem flimsy in comparison).  Thought at first that it was underpowered, but at about 500 miles it loosened up - and the mileage got better too.  Suspension sporty but not too rough.  Build quality appears to be excellent.  Things that at first seemed not to work correctly were actually just a lack of knowledge on my part.  It's a complicated machine and it takes some time and effort to understand (but some controls are  just bizarre and unintuitive, i.e. radio tuning).  Owner's manual worth studying closely!"

The first week we discovered it had a cracked exhaust system that need to be replaced. The drivers ventilated heated/cooled seat was not working and after many attempts it had to be completely replaced. The rear brake light had filled with water after it rained so that had to be replaced. The adaptive head-lights that are supposed to turn as you go around a corner they ended up being ""cross eyed"" so they replaced the entire passenger side head-light assembly.

While appearing expensive, the Range Rover can easily do 200K or more miles without expensive repairs if driven with respect.  I would recommend replacement of the original Ferodo brake pads and rotors with ventilated EBC pads and rotors.  The cost is much less, they last much longer and performance is more linear.

land-rover,range-rover,2010,riversider, 02/08/2011,Trouble free 2010 Range Rover HSE,4,"Absolutely no problems with my 2010 HSE after owning it for about 10 months, none ! Yes the gas mileage is not good but I knew that going in. I have enjoyed the vehicle tremendously, and the admiring stares I get while driving it is an added plus. Brown/bronze color ( bourneville) with brown leather interior piped in cream has elicited many many compliments. If anything, the engine doesn't idle quietly and silently as some luxury vehicles do. I love the car, who knew driving a vehicle would make people turn their heads or turn around and look when they pass you ?? "
land-rover,range-rover,2010,CJ, 09/19/2009,Great first impression,4,"I'll revisit the review once I own this RR a bit longer, but I took the 2010 SC a couple days ago and it's incredible. I've used this site a great deal - and thought I'd share the initial impressions for the 2010SC RR.  Tons of power, actually rears back when you really step on it, a bit more body sway than you'd like, incredible interior, new nav/audio is best in class, (we have a porsche and bmw current year to compare with).  All together - classy ride, very smooth, don't mistake it for a sport SUV - but the best at what it is supposed to be. Power, luxury, comfort, and classic styling. Loving it. "
land-rover,range-rover,2010,Aglerote, 10/13/2009,Satisfied owner,4,"This car replaced an MB ML63, one of the best cars I've ever owned but the too-firm ride began to wear me down (and my wife). Fortunately, the RR has a new and nicely-powered supercharged engine for 2010, since it was so easy to get spoiled by and used to the ML. So far, I have been very pleased with the RR. It's not sporty and is all about luxury / comfort; different strokes for different folks. It's basically an S-Class SUV. The RR has only 500 miles on it so far, so I will need to update these initial impressions in a few months.  Also, I'll soon be putting on true snow tires (to substitute for the all-season stock tires) and giving it some real-world back-road snow tests."

This truck is FAR superior to the older model... I have had a couple of recalls ( computer updates only) so it has been back to the dealer twice in two months... but has been wonderful, other wise."

Better handling, horsepower and luxury features that should have been included in a car at this price point. My 2008 was a pleasure to drive, the 2010 is great to drive. For anyone who drives long distances or spends as much time in their car as I do, this is a great vehicle to bide the time away. The improved technology features are a much needed improvement over the outgoing model, as is the greater horsepower. The virtual display screen that shows the odometer and rpm is nicer than the old gauges but a little cartoonish. Ride could be a little quieter and fewer trips to the gas station would be nice..."
land-rover,range-rover,2010,doc1899, 04/01/2010,Let's try this again!,2,First I would like to apologize to anyone who purchased a Range Rover based on my first review.  I should have waited more than a month to write it.  I'm actually on my 2nd 2010 RR HSE because I had way too many issues with the first one.  My dealer was kind enough to get me into a new one with no hassle.  HOWEVER- I've owned the second vehicle for a little over a week and it has already been back to the shop for an equipment failure.  I fear that 90k just went straight down the drain.

This will be the third time in less than 15,000 miles they have been replaced. The brakes are not worn down. I will be opening up a Lemon Law case against Range Rover because of this problem that apparently cannot be fixed. Service manager said my driving habits have cause the rotors to warp every 5,000 miles. My 2008 Range Rover never had any brake or warped rotor issues in the 22,000 miles i drove it for the year I owned it (purchased in 2009 and traded it in for the 2010 model.

At 60K had head gasket issue, that the range rover only recommends to change the whole engine... 10K swap. This car is 80K new, it should not have these problems for amount of money you pay. Comfort and looks are great but re ability is awful. Stay away if you can as it is a money pit. They need to step their game up if they plan on competing.

land-rover,range-rover,2010,baron58, 06/16/2011,Range Rover Autobiography Surprises,3,"Last year I bought a R/R Autobiography. Stornaway Grey with Ivory hide/black stitched and Piano Black wood........and what a car! Land Rover have produced the 4WD Bentley.
The overall finish is amazing, perfect paint, near perfect body shut-lines. Not Lexus-like but amazingly close.......and this is a Range Rover!!
The 4.2l supercharged V8 is superb, the ZF auto brilliant. Ride excellent although a bit of body roll due to weight and high c of g. Does not handle as well as the Sport. Ride comfort and silence at all speeds and road surfaces is world class. High spec level for this model in Australia leaves nothing to be desired. At Au$230,000 Land Rover's pricing is over the top."

This will be her car (I have an S-Class Mercedes and a BMW M5) and is enough to entice her out of her Lexus RX 350. She drove the new X5 and the GL 550 and found both to be too harsh. She loves the smoothness of the Rangie, the spaciousness, the interior, and the outward visibility (she's small). I like the fact that it jumps when I give it a full boot and doesn't make me want to hurt myself everytime I drive it (like her Lexus does).  The Supercharged RR blends luxury, power, and style in a way that few others can. This really is a truly amazing car that I dream of fondly."

It is great to look and drive, has a solid, smooth ride, doesn't feel like you're driving a 3 ton car.I've had many comments from other riders about the smooth ride. Offroading is no trouble at all. For the price however, I've had too many little things go wrong. My back up camera has reset, so it is reversed its image and the lines that show where you are heading are gone. You don't know what station you are listening to when the Nav screen is up kills me. Voice activation of the system is poor.

It exceeds ALL my driving expectations and experiences, including my X Mercedes SL500 and an X  Cadillac Escalade EXT.   At the moment I am not concerned with reliability because I am enjoying the ride which doesn't come cheap, or easy! It was in the shop yesterday for an update to the computer and it pained me to drive their loaner HSE something.

land-rover,range-rover,2010,Steve S., 07/13/2010,Four Months into Ownership,3,"So 4 months after my first review I still like this vehicle but it has unfortunately been to the dealership for 3 major problems. Electrical problems, workmanship flaws (my entire LCD odometer display was replaced) and little rattles have put a bit of a damper on my enthusiasm for a car that costs so much. The car is beautiful to drive and extremely comfortable, but twice a week to the gas station is unbearable. I am averaging 10.2 miles/gal according to the car's internal meter. The AC is overly complicated. Bluetooth clumsy, I am told I am difficult to hear by the people I call. Navigation is a disaster. as I stated in my earlier review, my Q7 had a much better Nav & blind spot monitor. "

Rover has been back to the dealer going on 3 times now. The speakers rattle horribly & the BlueTooth has so much static & drops calls so often that I have unlinked my phone. The phone system would also allow me to pick up calls, but then my callers could not hear me & I would have to pick up & speak through my cell. The camera dies out sometimes, but always seems to come to life when I schedule service.  Pixels on display disappear or spread out occasionally.  The driver settings clear out everytime I get out of the car. It's a real shame because the car is BEAUTIFUL & so much fun to drive!"

land-rover,range-rover,2010,Harvard AMG, 02/06/2010,Fantastic First Car,4,"I love this vehicle. I truly adore it. The engine is sometimes hard to control, especially for a teen driver, but I still believe that using it for everyday use is not only feasible, but encouraged. There are a few issues with reliability, such as an issue with the gearbox. But, I love to drive it around town. Fuel economy is a little dismal, but the Supercharged engine is worth it. I recommend buying it used. My parents purchased the car for me with 2,000 miles on it. My other choices were the GL450 (the front grille of the 550 irritated me), The X6 M, or the E63 AMG Wagon. Given that Range Rover had the most prestige, luxury, and the most advanced technology."
land-rover,range-rover,2010,Mark Cohen, 09/10/2020,Nothing but trouble,1,"I bought my 2010 supercharged Autobiography three years ago. After looking it over and taking it for a test drive during the day all seemed fine. When it got dark while driving from FL to PA the headlights only stayed on for 30 secs. Found out when I got it home they were faulty. So the first full day cost me $4,000 for new headlights. Soon after that the RR started overheating. So another $5,000 + for a new head gasket. Then the gearbox fault indicator warning came on and the vehicle would go into safe mode when trying to drive up a hill. Another $6,000 for a transmission rebuild. Safety mode still keeps on coming and then will slow the RR down without being able to change gear. I changed out all the vehicles solenoids and still the same problem. The vehicle came with 22"" rims and that made the steeringwheel shake. Another $5,000 for new rims and tyres and the shaking problem was fixed. So after spending over $30,000 on repairs alone over the last three years my dream vehicle still can't even get up a small hill without breaking down. I've owned many luxury cars in my time and I can honestly say that the Range Rover has been the biggest piece of crap I've ever owned. I would never own another one. And to think these are now $250,000 new.

In that time I've had 2 major service visits that required the SUV to stay at the dealer a combined total of 3 weeks. On the first visit the engine had an oil leak. A gally plug near the started was the culprit but oil leak Oma brand new engine with on 3000 miles was surprising. At 9500 miles the started showing an error and would not move up or down. Turns out the compressor went bad. Ive also had both seals on the main windows replaced, on the passenger side the mirror had to be replaced all together

I needed something a bit larger, so opted for the HSE.
I am a bit more used to some technological bells and whistles, but still love this car.
First, i find it odd, there is no unlock in park, I later learned even the supercharged does not, just odd.
the Nav system's screen is not the greatest, but compared to my 2012 Audi A-6, maybe nothing would.
The driving of this car however is amazing, comfortable and powerful, I LOVE IT.

So I took a bit of a chance on a new Range Rover.
The new vehicle s significantly enhanced over the 2003.
Better stereo, now with iPod integration.
Bluetooth, needed horsepower (the 2003 was slow to accelerate on the highway), backup camera, etc.

Mine is white, with an ivory and black interior.

Before the Rover I had a GMC Denali I still have it.
The Denali has 105,000 miles and I still do not need breaks.

In addition the Rover Satellite radio and electronic system is a joke for the money you pay.


My recommendation is save the money or buy a BMW, Porsche, or Mercedes

Honestly it was the most exciting car I had driven.  It is fast, handles like it is on rails and is good looking.  So in 2015 I decided to add to my collection with the new HSE.  I decided to go for the supercharged 6 for fuel economy since I live in Los Angeles and I am not towing anything.  The car is very good looking and I have no issues with the interior finish but I did have an annoying rattle that the dealership can't seem to find and stop and the electronics have frozen up several times and I needed to turn off the car to reboot.  Additionally, it takes 1-2 minutes when you start the car to initialize everything so don't try multi-tasking until the car is good and ready.  For example, there is no chance of turning down the volume on the radio while activating your seat heaters while backing up.  By the way you will do that more than you think.
But the worst is my transmission has gone out three times and on the cars first birthday it got a brand new transmission.  Isn't that special.  Okay now 10 days after getting the new transmission, I pulled into a restaurant and couldn't get my car out of drive!!  It literally wouldn't shift into any gear except Drive and I had to shut the engine off to put it into Park.  Bravo the new tranny lasted almost 2 weeks.

It could have been 40 times (electrical issues) but Land Rover does not have a fix for the Navigation Screen that completely shuts down (43 times and counting). Causing a total shut down of any feature you were using until it reboots. Worse off they knew about this issue and sold me the car without disclosing this. But I have several other electrical issues with this vehicle ( radio malfunction, phone issue, but scariest when my distronic did not activate), the list is longer but you get the point. Dont get me wrong, nicest driving car Ive ever owned, but for the price tag you could do so much better. Whats going to happen when this car is out of warranty, SCARY THOUGHT. Plus Land Rover Corporate is the worst company to deal with. The won't even acknowledge my issues or concerns. My dream car that I waited 45 years to buy, has turned into a nightmare.

land-rover,range-rover,2015,Mark, 09/24/2015,Worst Electrical Ever,1,"Complete nav/computer reboots all the time. Buttons connected to computer SLOW. Takes 2-3 seconds every time you press a button to respond.  Navigation takes up to 3 minutes to initialize after starting vehicle. Worst computer integration EVER!  Doors have unlocked and opened while driving!  Wow!

Update:  Vehicle has been in service for about 50 days over the past 6 months for a multitude of problems.  The nav screen continues to reboot about every 2 hours of drive time.  They have no idea whats going on.  Have been told by service that this is a common problem.  The computer integration with all of the functions just blows!  To turn on the seat heat and massage, you have to go into the navigation screen!  I do not like my passengers touching my navigation screen.  Same with their climate control.  You can't just put all the functions into the nav screen.  Way too many steps to do much of anything.  I find myself thinking that I would like to do something, but it is just too much of a pain in the butt to do so.  The screens look like they were designed by a 12 year old.  A real pet peeve is that I like to see the navigation FULL SCREEN.  So, I press the screen to put it that way (getting rid of the road exit information).  Then every time I go to a different screen , or the navigation gives a direction, it goes back to showing the road exit information.  Petty?  Yes.  But just shows the lack of detail that went into this vehicle.  On the satellite radio, they put so much worthless info on it, that you don't see the name of the song, just the artist, and the channel number.  Really?  It's a large screen, plenty of room if they did it correctly.  I know that's minor, but, every little detail was ignored in this vehicle.  When you pay this much for a vehicle, it should be easy to use, fun, and informative.  Not at all.  My Hyundai Genesis has a navigation/computer integration that totally blows this away.  At less then half the price.  I prefer to drive the Hyundai!  That's pretty bad.

After putting 18,000 miles on this vehicle, I have found this to be the most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever owned.  The seats are HORRID.  Like sitting in the cheapest airline seat.  This is a common comment from many passengers I've had.  It hurts to drive this vehicle for more than 2 hours at a time.  Your butt is just killing you.  There is NO padding in the front or rear seats because they cheapened it up so much to save weight.  My 2012 Range Rover SC was way, way, way better and nicer.  Also, the dashboard, which in my 2012, people used to comment on how nice the leather was, has been replaced with PLASTIC!  The interior looks  and feels cheap when you really get looking at the details.  There are WAY better vehicles for $120,000.  I really feel ripped off.  On the plus side, the acceleration, is outstanding, though and the ride is very nice.

Update 4/7/16.  Land Rover has agreed to repurchase this vehicle under the California Lemon Law.  Good Riddance!  Many people have exactly the same issues with this vehicle...

land-rover,range-rover,2015,Craig F, 09/27/2018,Long term review,2,"Update to my previous review.  Well my truck reached 57,800 miles. The warranty expired at 50,000 but have a CPO warranty to cover major issues for a little longer.  The water pump failed and the dealer also said the front crossover coolant pipe is leaking.  Strange since I never had any problems before the water pump failure. I must be the most unlucky person to have the crossover pipe and water pump fail at the exact same time. The Water Pump was covered under warranty but not the crossover pipe. Warranty does not cover any hoses or pipes. Beware of that.  Apparently this is a VERY common problem in Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models.  According to the dealer, water pumps usually fail at about 30,000 miles and I'm lucky to have it last to 57,000. They also said that they replace water pumps and crossover pipes all day long. Sounds like a manufacturing defect and LR won't stand by their products.  If you are OK with very expensive repairs/maintenance then RR are great. Dealer wants $2,200 to replace the crossover pipe which seems a bit extreme for a truck with only 57,000 miles.  

I've owned my RRS for 3 years and have to say that reliability and comfort are top notch.   The only thing I've had to do is change the tires and oil.  I did change the brake pads to ceramic due to high amounts of dust on the rims.  Interior comfort is exceptional, I do wish the seats would recline fully.  I have front and rear climate control with heated and ventilated seats all work great in the South Florida heat.  Visibility is good and the pano roof is amazing.  The truck handles great.  Gas mileage from the 3.6ltr V6 is pretty good.  I'm in the low 20mpg on average.  The only negative opinion I have is the Navigation System.  It never understands my commands and programming an address takes minutes.  It's just easier to use google, and storage is lacking.  The center console storage is a cooler, which is great but leaves no other storage for stuff we typically have in a car.   You won't be disappointed.

land-rover,range-rover,2015,Michelle Kellams, 02/05/2016,Best vehicle I've ever had,5,"Currently also have a Mercedes S550, have also had in the past 10 years 2 other S550s, Mercedes ML, Cadillac Escalade, Porsche Cayenne, Porsche Boxster and recently bought this to replace my 2012 RR Sport. Loved the sport but this by far is the best SUV on the market. I never had one issue with my sport and I've not had any issues with this full size either. Gorgeous interior/exterior great ride and height on the road. Only slight negative I can think of is the infotainment is slightly slow when turning down volume/pushing a button. Like a second or two. Overall its pricey but definitely boss.

**update one year later- still love it, still have had 0 problems. The only time it's been back to dealer is for the 15k mile scheduled maintenance/oil change

Update two years later-still no problems whatsoever.

They stuck me with a $6700 bill. I tried to trade in the car post repair and the Land Rover dealership valued the car at $33K total. What a joke!!!  MSRP was $82K, 44K miles and 4 years later only worth $33K with a new engine.  Trust me, they don’t stand behind their vehicles.  Avoid buying any vehicle from Land Rover unless you want to throw money away.  Worse customer experience of all auto manufacturers!

land-rover,range-rover,2016,Chris , 02/03/2020,The Gentleman's Tank,5,"Picked up a used 2016 Range Rover Supercharged LWB in Indus Silver with the Ebony interior. Originally priced at $130K, I managed to find it for $72K with only 8,000 miles on it, in perfect condition. Everything about it is rock solid: the power, the luxurious cabin, supple leather, huge interior, massive trunk space. The deployable side steps are great for my (short) wife, and the Meridian premium sound system is spectacular. Biggest drawback is the electronics -- quite dated and laggy in terms of response times. Does feature Bluetooth for connecting to your smartphone, but lacks the Apple /Android CarPlay setup. If you can get a gently use one, I think you can reduce the huge depreciation hit from a new purchase, which is optimal. I plan on driving this one into the ground over time, and am hoping the maintenance is kept to a reasonable amount.

Longevity, use, off road and was frankly surprised how well people liked it. 25-28 mpg on a 5,000+ lb vehicles?  My test drive, I beat the snot out of this engine and wanted to try 0-60, and braking. Impressed. The vehicle has 40,000 and from what I’m told these engines can easily go 250,000.  Americans want gas , power 0-60 in 4 seconds. Just not reality   I’ll take this diesel all day long. Oh clean burning as well. So go ahead and race by me, I’ll get there safely and in fine luxury.  CHEERS!!!

Definitely don’t recommend this car despite how beautiful it is on the outside and the appeal that comes with owning one.

land-rover,range-rover,2017,JIM D., 01/05/2019,RARE MULTI-SUV COMPARISON,5,"We have owned several premium SUVs within the last 20 years, mostly of German origin. In the past 24 months, we had the unusual situation of  simultaneously owning 2-2017 RR HSEs ( a diesel and a V6 gas), a 2017 Escalade ESV (lwb), and a 4 year old MB diesel suv. The RRs were purchased to replace the Escalade and the MB. We had grown tired of MB vehicles, because of frequent warranty issues, maintenance schedules and dated styling.  The Escalade was bought to pull a large boat and to be used for long trips. Even though it became one of our unexpected favorites. it's overall size turned out to be a negative for everyday use.  Now addressing our RR diesel ownership..... we love the car.....the power of the high torque diesel engine, 22 mpg. in town, its rather compact exterior size and very lux/ comfortable interior has won us over.  The gas RR is basically the same car, but the gas engine is no match for the diesel. The noise levels are basically the same, but the gas engine has never achieved its EPA ratings of 17/23. Those who have a hesitation of owning a car with a modern diesel engine, have probably never driven or owned one. Neither RR has had any warranty problems as of yet and the suggested maintenance schedules are better than most competitors. I've seen some criticism of the ""build quality"" not being  competitive.....but in my opinion the build quality meets or exceeds all of its competitors. One suggestion....if you are ordering or buying an existing car, make sure it has the ""surround view camera system"".

land-rover,range-rover,2017,Nicholas Hill, 03/02/2020,Worse company I have ever dealt with,1,"I purchased 2017 Range Rover HSE Long wheel base brand new brand new in September 2017.  Starting in Jan 2018, I noted some odd thuds and clunks from the undercarriage and made mention of it to my local dealership in Richmond.  I had my car in total over 5-6 times with multiple attempts to correct and isolate this problem.  The noise became more frequent and worse as time went on and although attempts were made and documentation stating noise was present....there was no resolution.  I was continually disregarded in a manner that was not of a 121k purchased vehicle. I did purchase the extended warranty on this car initially.  Around 49k miles, my car went back to Richmond for a 2 week period of time in which no resolution was made.  They opened up a case at JLR (what I was told), and although the noise was present, they said JLR said that this noise was an acceptable thing.  From September 2018 the repairs were from bushings replaced and tightened, nuts tightened, ""transfer case judder"" with a double flush and fluid additive technique, and sway bar mechanism system flush.""  ALL which did nothing for the issue.  They documented that the noise was there and basically said ""we dont know what else to do.""  I have this documented from Land Rover Richmond.  Who does this....right?  So I called corporate myself.  You will never get past the customer service representative.  Now coming from someone who is a surgeon, when you have this sort of post operative difficulty and issues, your patients speaking to your front desk is an unacceptable thing to let happen.  Although my CSR was pleasant, nothing was ever done. She recommended taking my car to another dealership. Not easy for someone who works over 100 hours a week and LR would not come and pick it up.  I had to drive it 4 hours to Charleston WV where the new diagnosis was .......wait for it..........Bad front and rear sway bar arms that needed replaced, there was fluid coming from the rear sway bar arm, and the kicker is ""my drive shaft.""  Said the knuckle on the end of it was broken and slipping and this was what was causing the noise.  They said verbatim, that we have seen this on other Long wheel base cars.""  All of this finally got replaced over the 2.5 weeks that they had my car.  They said they drove it after repair for 20 minutes and did not hear anything.  My father returned the car to me and the car is exactly the same.  I cannot get Land Rover Charleston WV to call me back and discuss.  They also did not follow up with me regarding the replaced parts.  One may ask too, ""How come a broken drive shaft was not picked up by a dealership, how could a drive shaft of this size get broken anyway?""  I put 52k miles on the car, 100% road miles, over the last 2.5 years. 
 The same thud at low speed 10-17mph, usually in parking lots, stop and go traffic, driving through neighborhoods.""  Sometimes it is a single thump and sometimes it feels like it is stuck trying to get out of whatever transmissitory thing that it is stuck in.  It is a very loud noise, heard by all who have ridden with me.  It is a very frustrating issue.  I was just contacted by the CSR who just informed me that unfortunately, since it is out of warranty, they could not buy back my car.""  She stated because it is out of warranty.  I asked her nicely, ""dont I have the extended warranty?""  She said ""yes, but purchase backs dont work with extended warranty.""  Long story short, I could win a law case with Lemon law, but I am completely exhausted with this company.   I will never purchase another Land Rover/Range Rover.  Therefore, I cannot recommend these cars to anyone, regardless of their status, comfort, build out.""  Not everything is about ""buying the most expensive and best.""  Customer service goes a lot longer then any engine could.  Also, in case you dont know, V8 range rovers come with something called Dynamic
 Response, where these sway bar arms are working constantly to keep your car level.  Great concept, but if you research on your own through threads, you will find that they have been a problem since 2005.

The interior is sheer class and the ambience in the cabin is first rate. Fuel economy is great given its size and its competition. The Merridien sound system is a must, as is the black pack. I also got the 707 wheels in 22""s and they make the car! JLR have some great new colors - I chose Carpathien Grey and did not look back. Great car!

Not even a blinker to signal to any of the other cars on the highway that my car was broken down. It was the first time I had driven the car since bringing it in to the dealership for multiple faults.  Before this near death experience, my husband and I experienced issues with the screen, the driver side door not closing, no ability to clear windshield when it is fogged up, issues with parking camera in addition to all the fault messages like suspension fault. I put less than 1500 miles on the car. It was certified pre-owned. Hopefully, Land Rover will do the right thing and get me out of this vehicle. This is my second Range Rover purchase.

land-rover,range-rover,2018,Blair, 04/13/2020,Nightmare Ownership Experience,1,"In all the vehicles I have purchased both personally and professionally I can only good to excellent experiences with the vehicle ownership albeit there may be a hiccup here and there, but that's to be expected.

After experiencing multiple issues with the 2018 Range Rover vehicle in less than a month of ownership and only having actual possession of the vehicle for 18 days in that month long period due to the time the dealership had it for the initial repairs it became clear the Range Rover I purchased was a lemon. 

It broke down for the first time not but a few miles from the dealership on the date of purchase. The battery light came on even though the dealership said the issue was a fuel sensor which was repaired. They assured me this issue would not occur again. Then the check engine light began coming on and going off seemingly randomly. Not yet having a permanent tag for the vehicle while experiencing multiple issues in less than a month clearly points to this being a problem vehicle, right? Well Land Rover didn't think so... they only said my vehicle didn't yet qualify for a re-purchase because the dealership was continuing to service the problems I was experiencing. So, if I understand that correctly, as long as they're attempting to correct the problems, no matter how many I experience over how long a period of time, this vehicle isn't a lemon deserving of a re-purchase even though I can't drive it more than half the time. Yes, let's allow that to sink in a moment...

The initial breakdown issue continues to re-surface despite the dealership supposedly repairing the problem each and every time. I can't know when or where I will be stranded. Good thing Land Rover Roadside Assistance is open during business hours on business days... oh wait, that doesn't help me outside of business hours on weekdays or anytime on weekends. 

Save yourself, don't buy any Land Rover product. They may be pretty and be loaded up with features and tech, but they're simply overpriced garbage that will bring undue stress and frustration into your life.

land-rover,range-rover,2019,Chris, 06/22/2019,Electronic Nightmare,2,"The electronics (entertainment and climate control) started malfunctioning the day I bought the car.  Dealer picked it up, gave me a loaner and took car to fix it.  It apparently needed a software update - seems like that should have been on the pre-delivery check list.  Ok.  A week later, the lower touch screen went totally blank.  Then the two knobs that control temp stopped working.  Dealer picked up the car again and apparently, the lower screen was bad and needed to be replaced.  Now the radio source randomly changes and the climate control (lower screen) seems to roll through random levels of working or not - I am happy that I bought this in the spring and consistent heat or A/C haven't been needed yet.  Car is going back to the dealer next week to see if the third time is a charm.  Will be noting to the dealer that another problem will result in initiating a Lemon Law suit.  The dealer has been great and I really couldn't say enough about their responsiveness which is very much in line or even exceeding expectations (which were high given the cost of the car).  If it wasn't for this issue, I would give the 2019 RR 5 stars.  I love everything else about the car.  Unfortunately, I seem to be getting more experience with their loaners (none of which have had a similar issue) than my vehicle.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2012,Ryan G, 05/20/2019,"Great vehicle with tons of class, and just a few b",4,"Range Rover is known for luxury. They are also known (along with parent Marque, Land Rover and Jaguar) for bugs, glitches, electronic troubles and maintenance costs. Truth is, the first few years of the Evoque were heavily based on the Ford Escape, and they share similar components. This is both a gift and a curse. The pleasantries can be seen when purchasing filters, fluids, light bulbs, brakes and hoses etc.  That all worsens when some of those stock parts are cheaply made. Look at it this way, the evoque is an extremely comfortable and tech-laden (and capable) version of the Escape and focus (similar platforms).  I've had mine for 4 months and the purchase price was too good to pass on.  I ca  change the brakes, rotors, pads, bulbs, oil.  sway bar components, filters, exhaust and a few other things with ease and at a reasonable price (dont go to  Land Rover dealer ).  But it's going to  be tough when things that arent labeled FoMoCo start to breakdown (hard to find outside of LR service shops). Fuel economy isnt great, and you pretty much have to use 91 octane or higher. I can easily achieve 27mpg highway, but city drops to 18-20.  For such a small car, its weight really kills it (massive wheels and tires, tons of leather, tech, and a sophisticated AWD system).  Speaking of AWD...LR is legendary for theirs and the evoque is no exception. I've been through snow, sand, mud and even did some light rock crawling.....effortlessly. As for the entertainment system and HMI, it works, it's got some cool features (surround view camera is awesome and works while in drive and is great for offroading.) BUT, it's stupid slow.  To be expected for a lower class car in 2012, but a range rover? FCA has had faster units since 2007.  The bright side is, there are a couple of companies that offer an android auto/apple car play system/module that works in conjunction with the stock radio unit. Not too expensive and it's easy plug n play. Overall, I love my Evoque. It's been a dream car since 2011 and I wouldn't trade it for much of anything .

Driving slow or fast, the Range Rover Evoque handles it in style and comfort with a feel of total control and confidence.
Gas milage is 30% better than my 06 Carrera S and I don't miss the speed because the Evoque is plenty fast enough and has great off line punch.

Oh yeah, it had to have paddle shifters. This car does all of the above and is more fun to drive than I expected. Getting 32 MPG on the highway at 70 MPH, not nearly as much when racing through the hills. No problems so far."

Will let me start by saying that I'm 38 years old and have gone through about 37 cars already due to my love for cars , However I have never experienced such poor service then land rover.The major problem that we experienced was due to the shifter malfunction causing the car to engage in gear and running into my parked Car. Range rover had found 3 fault codes and replaced the electronic gear shifter.After calling range rover they are refusing to pay for damages and my demand of replacing the car. This car could have killed someone and they just don't seem to care . This was my 1st and last Land Rover

I am just shy of 2 months owning the vehicle for 3 years and oh my what a terrible experience I have had with the car. The car is also nearing 40,000 miles. 

So far what has gone wrong with the car: 

@ 07000 miles the radiator started leaking coolant
@ 11000 miles both front wheel arch molding popped out needed to be replaced. 
@ 12000 miles Engine check light on, sensor replaced
@ 12005 miles Engine check light on again (yes the very next day) said the crankshaft/piston was not working properly, had to get it replaced.
@ 13000 miles tail lights started to fog up, both tail lights replaced
@ 18000 miles head light not working, replaced headlight
@ 21000 miles same head light not working again!
@ 25000 miles power lift gate stopped working, reprogrammed. 
@ 28000 miles engine check light on, turbo failed, brand new turbo was replaced. 
@ 30000 miles rear wheel arch molding came loose again replaced new
@ 33000 miles car says coolant level low, topped of coolant
@ 35000 miles car says coolant level low again! This time replaced brand new radiator
@ 38000 miles car says coolant level low, topped of coolant
@ 38500 miles car says coolant level low, topped of coolant
@ 39500 miles car says coolant level low, dealer saying was leaking coolant! replaced piping / seals
@ 39505 miles (yes the very next day) airbag light came on!
@ 39700 miles (today) the infotainment console is not turning on! 

I'm sure I'm missing out on a whole lot more times I had to visit the dealership! but on paper that's 17 times to the dealership for faults and repair! if you average it out that means a trip to land rover dealership every other month! 

talk about reliability! after the warranty expires I must sell the vehicle because of all these problems! A very bad bad experience on my first new car! 

At least the dealership didn't have a bad attitude with whole situation! or else I will be very angry!

Around 30 mph if you are maintaing speed in traffic and give it just a little gas, it drops a gear, jumps the rpm's to 3000, the turbo kicks in, you yank your foot back off and try to slowly accelerate.
HORRIBLE, especially for a >$60k vehicle.
I have never had a more jerky ride, and it is making me hate this vehicle.
And on top of that, my tail lights filled with condensation after the first car wash.
6 months later, I am still waiting for the ""new improved ones coming out in 2014.""

No Carfax notification regarding the Turbo that had already been replaced in the TWO years the previous owner owned the vehicle, while under warranty.  Land Rover Corporate REFUSES to pay for the replacement of the Turbo that has gone AGAIN and won't acknowledge that it is a known issue with the vehicle.  Very, very disappointed in their stand to NOT warrant their product.  I was given every excuse in the book from Corporate as to why this is my issue, not a faulty vehicle or faulty part issue.  A bunch of crap for a very expensive vehicle!!  I've had better luck with Lincoln and Audi - and I'll go back to a company that stands by their product.

I truly loved and still love this vehicle.  Then 66K miles hit and it all went downhill.  I regularly maintained the vehicle.  At 66K, a gear became completely shredded, one that controls many functions of the vehicle and shouldn't have been shredded at that point.  3K to fix. I was willing to overlook it.  As I was willing to overlook the interior lights randomly coming on 5K miles into owning it, the stereo not always working until I stopped and restarted the engine, the steering wheel controls randomly working, the best MPG being 17, the brakes needing replacement once a year.  All good. Now, at 70K miles, I need a new engine, and neither the dealership nor nor second opinion, a trusted mechanic can explain why.  70K miles.  $15,000 to fix.  The dealership, one of three I have been to, are complete [non-permissible content removed], and are unable to offer any explanation or offer for a trade-in.  The fourth cylinder just all of a sudden stopped firing.  I guess that means new engine.  Again, 70K miles.  I really do love this vehicle, but I have heard the same story from a couple others.  Lease it.  Don't buy it.  What a shame.

Can only think of two minor issues 1) the turbo can be a little slow in kicking in, so don't count on making a quick pull out in front of traffic, but once the turbo kicks in it is truly a rocket car. 2) There is an exhaust smell that comes into the cabin upon start up for the first 2-5 mins.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2014,Regina Carver, 11/24/2017,Potential Buyer Beware. Updated: 08/26/20,1,"I purchased a brand new vehicle from this dealership, and unbeknownst to me, the vehicle has a faulty, defective and unsafe transmission.  The vehicle is a Range Rover, Evoque.  The dealership replaced the transmission with less than 10,000 miles on the vehicle.  I wish this was where the story ends.   The problem was not resolved.  The same issues of jerking into gear persisted.  This is scary!!  After the vehicle was returned to me on a couple of occasions, the problem was even worse!! While under warranty, this dealership told me there was nothing else they could do to repair the vehicle, knowing the problem was unresolved.  I was given no recourse on what could be done to rectify the problem.  Unbelievable!

Update: 05/27/18
I reached out to the CEO, Ralf Speth, no response from him.  As early as March, 2018, this manufacturer had a rating of ‘No Rating’ by the Better Business Bureau.  This business is not BBB accredited.  As in my case, the company did not respond and my case was closed and noted as such.  And at that time in March, it was posted that the business was in the process of responding to previously closed cases.  Their rating was changed to ‘B-‘, they were unable to resolve issues and did not respond in others.  In my opinion, do not be misled by the shiny object and purported reputation.  In my experience, this is a very unethical company.  Yes, things may go wrong with a vehicle.  But be advised, you may not receive the expected treatment that is comparable to the situation with this company.  I have a useless vehicle and the only way to get only part of my money back is to sign a falsely stated proposed settlement that was offered.  If you would like to follow this true story, you can check out my blog at: https://myvehicleexperience.com.  I recently discovered that this company sold over 22,000 vehicles with a defective transmission.  It is outlined in the aforementioned blog.  However, they do not participate in the Consumer Report Annual Customer Satisfaction Survey.  I will cover their response as to why they do not participate in a later blog post.

A car purchase is one of the primary purchases one will make in this lifetime.  Please, please do your research.  




Days later, I contacted the dealership to ask what could be done, since the problem still existed and the vehicle is under warranty.  With my persistence, I was told that I need to contact the corporate office.  Even though later I learned that this is not their normal protocol.  Normally when they cannot resolve an issue, the dealership will contact the corporate office for guidance.  That did not happen in my case.

Long story short, the corporate office has offered nothing but a proposed agreement that does not address the issues they promised to address.  So I am still in possession of a defective vehicle which is still under warranty.

I would not recommend purchasing a vehicle from this dealership or company.  I would have never in a million years expected this type of situation, dealing with a luxury car dealership or company.  It’s not only that the vehicle is defective, it’s the process that is being used to resolve this issue.  This nightmare could happen to you.  Don’t take any chances.  Use your power of choice and do your research to support your choice.  A vehicle is one of the largest purchases one makes, and you do not want to have it coupled with such an unpleasant experience.

Update 08/26/20
To my surprise, I received a notification from this company about the defective transmission issue this year and after the warranty expired.  If you would like to view the notification, I have posted it at: www.myvehicleexperience.com. Apparently, the transmission issue is a widespread problem and the company's answer is to offer three different options to the owners.  But there is a catch.  You have to sign the notification and return
 it.  And with the customer's signature in tow, the company is relieved of any liability.  The problem with this is: it's as if not offering anything because...as proven in my situation...the company does not know how to repair the transmission problem but they want to be absolved of any responsibility to the owners of these vehicles.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2014,Uphaus, 05/19/2019,Transmission Replacement Req @ 56K miles cost $16k,1,"Buyer Beware: I am not one to use social media to blast a company but in this case, there is no other option. I had a Land Rover when Ford owned them and the quality and service was beyond my expectations. My daughter has since bought one and the reliability and customer service are disgraceful. While on the expressway the transmission went into neutral because of a known defect that caused a recall on other models. Only 6,000 miles out of warranty and they want $16,000 dollars to replace a transmission that was obviously defective. $16,000!!! 
Neither the dealer nor the ""corporate representative"" has offered any resolution in spite of multiple phone calls and messages. In the meantime, she is paying daily for a rental car and has not been offered a resolution to something that should be considered a safety violation. When did Land Rover stop caring about their quality and customer service? How can you justify the higher costs of the vehicles, parts, and repairs with such despicable work ethics?

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,Melissa, 10/19/2015,Hands Down Safest SUV,5,"I leased a 2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (Pure plus with options) in February 2015. It had some software issues during the first month (key was locked inside vehicle so that was an issue that needed to be addressed early on) but the dealership was very accommodating. I never had an issue with the Evoque after that. I do find that a bigger engine would be better because it is a big sluggish to take off. It handled the road very well and it was a very smooth ride as well. It had very good gas mileage especially on long drives. Entertainment system is great!
****The most important thing that I will tell you is that 2 weeks ago, this truck was involved in a rollover accident and it was considered a total loss. Injuries to myself and the driver were very minimal as we walked away from the scene with minor injuries (cuts and scratches). For that very reason, I am going to get another one.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,Lynn C, 10/01/2015,I expected so much more!,3,"First the good:  This is a great looking car and there are so few on the road I feel special driving it.  Also, it handles quite well in snow and ice.

The bad:  It's small, you can't close the trunk from the inside of the car, the navigation system is horrible (I've been routed to dead ends more times than I care to recall), the front seats have no lumbar support, the rear window is way too small and the transmission is jerky.  The front console is too small and there are too many controls on the steering wheel that could adversely affect driving.  

The ugly:  New front and rear brakes and tires required after only 25k miles!   Cost of routine maintenance is ridiculous, and the excessive number of software updates required is unheard of and take FOREVER. 

Unless you like spending time at the service center and wasting money, move on to something else.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,Wakes, 09/02/2015,Unreliable Slug,1,"I purchased my Evoque new in February 2015.  Since the vehicle was purchased it has had a software update (at 1200 miles) for the transmission to improve performance.  Then the check engine light came on at approximately 2K miles.  Turned out to be a faulty sensor that took several days to repair, due to part being unavailable.  On August 1st, while in traffic the transmission froze up and the vehicle rapidly decelerated with the dashboard warning indicating ""Gear Box Failure"", resulting in the vehicle being towed.  Land Rover corporate claims they have since resolved the problem with another software update, however I have not had the opportunity to drive the car yet-33 days later.  While the dealership was addressing another issue- freeze up problem with the touch screen interface; the computer module blew out.  After 33 days the part has finally come in.  The transmission on this vehicle is very sluggish in the lower gears, and power is very limited from a stop position, which makes pulling out into traffic a challenge.  I really would love to recommend this vehicle, but the amount of problems and poor transmission and acceleration make this a poor and hazardous vehicle to own.  It does get good mileage, when working. I have never experienced a new vehicle with so many issues in such a short period. Land Rover Corporate's attitude has been less than overwhelming. Extremely disappointed in the vehicle and the corporation.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,BVA, 02/13/2018,Very Good SUV,4,"This is an execellent SUV, but you have to know what you are buying. This is not a large car, and it has quirks like all Landrover Vehicles I have had before. The most glaring positives are a very refined interior finish and quality. Very nice use of leather and other materials. On the outside styling is better than any other SUV on the road. The negatives are that the new flashy plastic panels used on the exterior are prone to scratching very easily and they should really be tougher. Even the car wash scratches them without the use of brushes. The tires are prone to quick replacement but have Porche type grip so no complaining here. Braking is excellent, better than any Range Rover before as well as gas mileage. Car, feels like it is supercharged. There is a need for improvement, the leather does not look like it will hold up like previous Range Rovers, and the car needs a bigger cargo area. Options add up quick and this SUV should come in under 49k with options in the next generation, as without doing so really makes the value proposition hard to support.  Note the car should be broken so that it is reliable. You can't drive very agressive for the first 1500 miles. The brakes and engine will not then be smooth.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,Mike Walsh, 04/05/2019,Rang Rover 2015 Evoque - Transmission problem (Gea,2,"Was excited at first, but the luster wore off quickly. Purchased a new 2015 Evoque and experienced numerous problems requiring 'Software Updates' which seems like a go to answer for everything. 51K miles and the Turbo died which cost a pretty $3,400 to repair, the dealership answer was 'well sometimes that happens'. Now as of April 2019, my wife was driving the transmission provided a 'Gear Box Fault'. Towed to the dealer who ran diagnostics. Service technician calls and says a full transmission replacement is required. Cost is $17K! Holy crap. The cars only worth $15K. History repeats itself, Land Rovers break too much and costly to keep. Buy 2 Hyundai for the price of 1 LR/RR and save yourself the misery. My Buick and Ford's have held up better then this. Bad investment on our part.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,Kerry, 01/20/2017,Don't buy this car!!!,1,"This car is a death trap. It has been in the shop more than in my driveway. Too many electrical issues to speak of. Bluetooth replaced and still works when it wants to. Navigation is by far the worst I have ever seen. Oh yeah and the whole shutting down while you are driving on a major highway and locking up for no reason thing. I took it in for the same issue with wanting to stall since the first week I drive it off the lot. I was given the car back numerous times with the ""We couldn't find anything"" speel every single time. It has now been put back in the shop after the 5th or 6th time only now it completely shut off while driving. Then there's the random throwing itself into park and shutting down while trying to pull into my driveway as well. I can go on all day with what a piece of garbage this almost $50,000 vehicle is. The customer service is a joke as well. You will bring it in and won't see it sometimes for weeks. They will lie about not having a replacement vehicle for you to drive and whether you have an appointment or not you will spend a minimum of 4 hrs there. However if for some insane reason you do buy this joke of an suv, when you bring it in take a look around and watch how many cars get pulled up to service while you are there. Some with 13 miles on them not 13000 but 13!!! Too many to count came through and when speaking to the valet they said more cars in service than on the lot. So there ya go. I hope whoever is thinking about buying this pos looks at all the horrible reviews and goes to toyota and gets a real suv.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,James, 08/04/2015,Not that impressed ! 11 month update!,3,"Okay, never wrote a review before so here it goes, I hope this helps others.
I'm comparing our new 2015 Range Rover to our 2013  GLK 350. They both costs us about the same. We wanted to try the new Range Rover this time around. Let's start with the outside, we love the look however, no roof racks. You have to buy them at about $1400. The GLK looks like a family car while the Rovers lines look clean and stylish.
The cargo door opens with the remote however, you have to push the button on the tailgate to make it close. The GLK you can just use the remote to open or close. The interior, the cargo bay is a lot smaller then the GLK. The driver seat feels okay not great. The finish work inside compared to the GLK , the GLK wins hands down. The steering wheel feels off, not sure why just yet. I can't put it into words, it just feels off. The sound system lacks just about everything, don't plan on rocking out while driving.
The take off is good for a 4 banger, yet the transmission shifts hard in and out of gear at times. The interior noise level is a lot louder then the GLK. The GLK has a nice wood finish while the rover is plastic. The backup camera sucks! seriously guys you need to give this some real attention. The ride? This is where the rover is really lacking when comparing it to the GLK. If you hit a good size dip in the road plan on losing your back molars, felt more like a tank then a luxury rover. I'll update this after I take it off road. The rover feels light and you feel more of the road while the GLK is a much smoother ride. The navigation? This is a 50/50 the GLK navigation has no clue what I'm saying and there has been more then one time when I wanted to tear it out of the car over frustration. The rover map it tough to follow because it show you going north, south, east or west and you can get spun around looking at the map. The controls on the steering wheel are terrible on the rover. Don't push too hard on the volume or you will change the radio station, very frustrating, and no mute button. The back window is tough to see out of. The lane assist is on the weak side. The GLK makes a noise inside if you try to change lanes with a car in the blindspot, the rover just blinks,,the GLK one has saved my bacon more then once. The rover does have sensors that let you know you are too close in the front and rear while parking. The GLK does not, if it did my wife would not have backed into another car! 
The Bluetooth for your phone. Your really going to have to have some patients with the rover, you say a command, the command comes up on the screen and it ask you is this the correct command, it takes forever to get though the commands to make one call. The GLK just say a name and it makes the call. Feels like talking to a 5 year old with the rover, don't have too much coffee when asking the rover to make a call or you may end up losing it? this clearly needs some work.
So why did we buy the rover? I lease a new car every 30 months and we really wanted to try the new rover. The new GLK won't be out until 2016 and I never want the first year of a completely new car. Just from the two weeks having the new rover and driving both side by side I'll most likely go back to another GLK after this lease is up. Glad this is my wife's car!

Update after 11 months. 
Off road? It is very capable, my only complaint was all the cameras coming on, this is a great feature I'm just not sure how to use it yet. 
We were having a warning message coming saying all wheel drive not working, after four times in the dealership they got it fixed.
The key fob stop working one day and I was stranded with no way to start the car. They sent a tow truck, at least their services department is on it and will take good care of you.
As I mention previously the GPS in the rover sucks! I cannot tell you how many times it has taken me the long way or in the wrong
 direction completely. Rover services said there is nothing they can do to fix it. Rattles? 
This thing has on and off rattles that are driving me crazy. And I mean crazy! I take it in for them to find and fix and it won't do it for the dealership. 
It sucks gas likes it's free. 
Other then the cool factor of the body I'll be leasing another Mercedes-Benz once our lease is up.  Sorry rover, you guys need to work on your finished product a little better. For the same price I can get a better product. I feel if they make some corrections this could be a great SUV.
Hope this helps others

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,Cliff, 08/22/2015,Stylish SUV,4,"The Evoque is a fun car drive.  It looks great inside and out.  The ride is comfortable most of the time, although larger bumps are not suppressed.  It is a great handling SUV.  My gas mileage is about 21 in mixed driving, although the Evoque on board computer says its 23.  The transmission has 9 speeds, and it can take a second for it to find the gear you want in comfort mode, it reacts faster in sport mode.  The paddle shifters work well.  I would not recommend this as a family SUV it's too small, but if it's just you or just you and a friend or spouse, it's a great size.  The panoramic sun roof is a great feature at night or when it's not too hot out.  The stereo and navigation controls can use some improvement, they are slow to react to touch.  The climate system is excellent.  Overall, after one month and a thousand miles, I'm happy with the Evoque, it could use some updating in the electronics, and the gas mileage could be better, but I just enjoy driving it.

I went out of state, more than an hour and a half from where I live. I cannot tell you the difference in treatment I was afforded.  The vehicle itself is overall a great vehicle to drive. I previously owned a lr2 before I purchased my evoque.  I have not had any serious issues. My 2 wheel traction lights has come a couple of times while I was driving and has caused the vehicle to slow down to a stop. So far Land Rover dealership, near me, has not been able to find out what the issue is. I think it is a nice vehicle overall.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2015,Joseph Teyssandier, 03/03/2016,A Ford Escape wearing a dinner jacket.,1,"All looks and no actions. A brand that I always admired Land Rover. My dream SUV turned out to be my worst nightmare and biggest disappointment in the automobile industry. As an avid car fanatic. I've had the pleasure of owning and leasing most of the high end vehicles in the market. From Mercedes Benz to BMW to Lexus both in sedans and SUV's. 
Until I decided that I was able and comfortable enough to finally afford my first Land Rover product. The 2015 Range Rover Evoque Pure Plus (5door). Well, my biggest mistake. I purchased the entity on 2/26/2015 as a Certified Pre Owned with barely 17K miles on the odometer. The vehicle looked show room condition inside, outside and under the hood. Rich leather scent inside gorgeous full glass roof and one of the most impressive infotainment systems I've ever seen. 
After driving it home and four days into my purchase I decided to google reliability of said vehicle and under Consumer Reports all reviews were one star and the horror stories were too much to mention from all over the world from the UK to Minnesota all over the US. People just devastated with their experiences A TRUE CAR BUYERS NIGHTMARE. Everything from engine stallings to sudden braking at high speeds causing driver and passengers injuries. To constant Check Engine lights and other notifications of malfunctioning all over the cluster. Repeated visits to the dealership days and weeks without their cars then getting back and the next day the same issues arising and the worst thing was the treatments by the dealer's disconcerting attitude. To the point they said to a particular owner. WELL WE CANT DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU .... CONTACT LAND ROVER. 
After coming across this unexpected and disappointing horror stories I decided to return the Evoque just today 3/2/2016 on the fifth day and I was fortunate enough that the dealership has a FIVE DAY Return/Cancel or Exchange Policy. 
So I got my 2014 Mercedes Benz E350 back (Luckily again it had not been sold yet) got my title back and PUSHED THE PEDAL TO THE MEDAL. Like a bat outta hell I rushed home. I was one of the lucky ones. 
Shame on you LAND ROVER and JAGUAR brand. You're selling RATS WRAPPED IN MINKS. 

Disappointed.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2016,Stephen M, 12/04/2016,Beautiful vehicle but oh the poor reliability,4,"UPDATE TO REVIEW 6-5-17: SInce the dealership completely rewired my car, I have not have had any electronic issues. It took a very long time to get there, but the car now appears to be reliable. It continues to be a pleasure to drive now that it is working properly. 

I really love my Evoque. Super comfortable and so many hi tech features that put this car in a class by itself. The high beams turn in and off by themselves when they sense a dark road.  The connectivity to my iPhone is amazing and my music effortlessly plays thorough the radio. The rear window is small, but better than you'd have in a convertible and you get used to it right away. Overall, a great vehicle. But the shoddy build really makes one rethink this purchase. My car came with a leak in the AC and spent 10 days in the shop. Then, the entire radio system went out. Got that fixed, too. Then, the map in the nav screen disappeared and it seemed that the car was incorrectly wired. When fixing that, we discovered that half the speakers were not connected. The sound was always terrible and suddenly it was like a symphony. Then the AC lost power (on a 110 degree day of course). More wiring issues. Kudos to my dealer who essentially rebuilt my car. Since then, it has worked like a dream but I have never had such a poorly built car. The factory in England where this vehicle is assembled should,d be ashamed of themselves. I suppose if yours is built right, you'll have a worry free ownership experience but I was not so lucky. They do give you a Land Rover or Jaguar loaner so it could be worse, but I'd much prefer they learn how to build a better vehicle. In balance I love my Evoque so that says something considering my repair history.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2016,Jezabel, 03/17/2017,"After much deliberation, I'm happy with my Evoque!",4,"I was looking at waiting for a 2018 Q5 or going back to a BMW X3 (I had had a 2011 and loved it) or an Evoque.  I decided the X3 needs a refreshed look.  The Evoque appealed to me because I wanted 4x4 to drive on the beach.   I was a little skeptical about the mixed reviews I read, but I still wanted it.  So I bought a 2016 with 12k on it that had been part of the dealers loaner fleet.  I didn't want to pay full price for a new one in case I ended up not liking it.  I've had it for three weeks and I am enjoying it.  I don't have any kids and it's usually just me in the car.  The back seat is tight, so it's not so conducive to car seats.  After having the BMW X3 with tech package, I don't know that any car's navigation/entertainment will impress me.  The way it operated with the joy stick was seemless and intuitive.  The cockpit in the Evoque is uncluttered and easy to figure out.  The response on the screen could be a little faster, but I am knit picking.  It works fine.  The navigation sometimes gets you very close to your destination but not quite there and says ""you have arrived, navigation ended"".  But again, it's usually close enough to figure it out.  I would not buy the car without blind spot detection (drivers assistance package) and any camera/parking sensors available.  I had a hard time finding a 2016 preowned with it, but I was determined.  Apparently the way it was packaged in that model year, a lot of people didn't get it.  The blind spot from the rear pillars is significant so you need it.   I didn't get the pano roof just because I was tired of looking and this car had everything else I wanted.  I don't really miss it.  I think passengers enjoy it more as it makes the back feel less clousterphobic.   Pano roof was optional on the SE Premium for the 2016 model.  It comes standard on the 2017 SE Premium.  I did not like the standard wheel, I got the 19"" split spoke.   I got white with the lunar/ivory two tone seat and I love it.  I had thought I wanted almond interior, but I love this.  Gas mileage is poor.  The gauge tells me i am getting 15-16 miles a gallon.  Seats are super comfortable.  Remote start from your iPhone is a cool feature.  Takes a little more time than from a key fob, but it's fine.  There is not a ton of room in the hatchback.  They purposely have a bump out in the interior lining of the hatch to accommodate golf clubs.  If you carry two sets of clubs, you may have to put part of the back seat down.    The engine does shift a little differently than I was used to but it's not bothersome.  The ""waistline"" on the car is high which is another reason cameras come in handy.  I'm enjoying the car.  I like that it's unique looking.  Everything is starting to look the same.  I test drove Mercedes GLC, Acura RDX, Lincoln MKC, Audi Q5.  I did love the Q5, it was very fun to drive; but I wanted to get the Evoque out of my system.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2016,Bruce, 10/03/2015,Range Rover vs. Porsche Macan,4,"I test drove the Range Rover and the Porsche Macan.  I couldn't justify paying 10K extra for the Porsche Macan. Sure the Porsche's engine was strong and had better pick up and felt expensive but was it worth 10K more.  I really like my red Eovque and it gets a lot of great looks and compliments.  I would like the pick up to be a little faster in the Evouqe but given the recent news about VW, I would give up power for better emissions. The interior is very nice and feels classy.  i acutally had to read the owner's manual from almost front to back to understand all the features.  The SUV looks comparably small compared to other SUVs and lack of trunk space is noticable (i had a Audi Q5 before).  Overall I am very satisfy with this purchase. i probably paid too much for it but oh well.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2016,Melissa McDonald, 09/17/2018,"Top ""RANGE"" Compact SUV",4,"It is still premature to provide a solid review having just purchased my 2016 Range Rover Evoque Dynamic HSE within past month. However, I have spent several months that involved many days and several hours of researching, driving Evoques, visiting dealerships, reviewing websites, asking questions, comparing answers, talking to other Land Rover owners, and obtaining as much available and specific information regarding Land Rover. I am extremely particular about purchasing vehicles and have experienced both good and bad vehicles in 25+ years of driving. Like many, I do not look forward when the time rolls around to start considering my next vehicle purchase. Being a mother of 3 with a demanding professional career I look for vehicles with reliability and dependability that will last me 10 years with the absence of repair headaches and provide confidence that the time spent servicing vehicle is only for standard maintenance requirements. I am happy with my Range Rover Evoque and hope it will meet my high expectations for years to come. One significant point I would like to share for those considering purchasing a Land Rover vehicle in the future is to expect high costs for extended warranties. It's no secret Land Rover vehicles are expensive to maintain and repairs are costly if required. If purchasing pre-owned and looking to purchase  extended warranty, do not be shocked at the price tag of $5K+ depending on year, make, model, current mileage, projected yearly mileage you intend to drive etc. It is wise to factor this expense into your purchase beforehand so your not left with your mouth hanging open in utter shock

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2016,Stupid is what stupid does, 12/06/2016,Don't be fooled by the good looks!,2,"Wow! Where do I start. If you buy this expensive ""Ford Escape"" be prepared for poor reliability. Really, read the reviews! This poor excuse for an expensive SUV is riddled with quality issues.
I wish I had driven it more than a couple of miles on my test drive. It rides as an off roader, it is NOT a cruiser. The lane assist
doesn't work half the time and there is no beep if someone is in your blind spot while using your signal...worthless.
The hands free rear hatch requires several off balance swings of your foot before it decides to open.
The car has a very heavy understeer. The ride quality is the worst excuse for a 50k SUV. 
The throttle response is pathetic, because of the worst turbo lag I've ever experienced. The transmission shift points are only
precise if you floor it, but why would you....after just 150 miles I achieved a whopping 17 mpg! The manufacturer says 24 combined. Why do you think it comes with an 18 gal. tank?. I returned it and traded in for an Audi. Stupid is what stupid does.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2017,Emily, 03/03/2018,Really Love My RR!!!,5,"I read another review the really throws this RR under the bus.  To be honest, there are a few quirks that need to be ironed out, but in general I LOVE my SUV.  It feels so solid and stable when you drive it, I do not worry about safety at all.  I live in a cold climate and heated seats are a must, but having a heated steering wheel and heated windshield - OMG! Love. Can't live without. It's true the app for the remote starts is pretty much junk, if they could work on that or offer an alternate remote start - it would go a long way.  Do my tires lose air, yep.  But that is very common in cold climates with this type of wheel.  Just pop into the dealer - they will fix it.  If the brakes get a little salt in them, they are quite squeaky and howly - again very common for colder climates albeit in super annoying.  In the last few sentences, I've told you all my complaints.  That's it. (Except that it does not have a garage door opener in  the mirror and also does not pop up text messages on the monitor - 3rd world problems.)  This SUV is the perfect height off the ground.  Not too low, not too high.  Friends with arthritis cannot say enough about the ease of access.  Winter driving?  Does anyone compare?  It was awesome. Easy. Safe. I would not have a problem lettting my kids drive the RR in a snow storm!   The 11 speaker Meridian sound system is amazing.  The back row seat are FULL SIZE!  Not a little kiddy bench.  Full size means a little bit less leg room, but just pull the front seat up.  My 2 boys, both over 6 feet tall, sit tandem all the time w/o complaints.  Plus the back seats are heated!  Cargo is limited, but still more space than a car. You feel like you are driving a car and not a school bus.  I really appreciate that because 90% of the time it is just me in the car.  I really can't say enough about my RR.  It was my first RR and I have been pleasant surprised.  I guess I thought it was a glorified name, but I was wrong!

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2017,Rick Pappas, 03/28/2019,Never again. Buyer beware.,1,"This car has been in the dealer more days then I’ve actually owned it. It seems Land Rover dealers fight you every step of the way until you threaten legal action.  I’ve never owned such an unreliable car, ever.  And I’ve had a lot of cars.  Eventually the engine seized on me last month in my 17 Evoque. It was in the dealer for 6 weeks and Land Rover was initially fighting me saying it was something I did to cause it, like not maintaining it. Which is completely not true. Had to get a lawyer. The car was under full warranty still. They wound up replacing the entire engine. It cost Land Rover corporate $15k in repairs, as that’s what the dealer was reimbursed by them.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2017,Rick, 01/07/2018,Shame on Land Rover,1,"10 months owned, only 4500 miles, wife does not feel safe transporting grand children to nursery school, truly hates This vehicle.
The ‘remote start’ feature is not on the key, ‘remote start’ Only works by iPhone app, has only a 25 percent reliability, and when it does start it does not turn on the climate control; so the vehicle is hot on warm days but more uncomfortably, it is very cold on cold days. A premium ‘cloth’ seat package would be helpful.
The seat belts are difficult to reach between the seat and the door; also they are very difficult to get down to the latch/receptacle between the center console and the seat.
There is a bright metal strip along the dashboard that reflects sun into the eyes of the front passenger.
The tires need to be refilled every 60 days, the wheels are easily damaged due to a poor choice of tires, those wheels will collect snow/ice and will cause a very unsafe ‘bounce’ at 25 mph as they rotate out of balance.
Shopping packages and contents will fall out of the vehicle as the lift gate opens.
Front brakes are making a medium-pitched ‘howl’ sound, or is it from the back brakes?
The value of this 2017 Land Rover Evoque has dropped $14,000 after only 4480 miles on the odometer. 
 Have been asking Land Rover for help pleasantly,  do not want to be put on a “forum” to evaluate future Land Rover vehicles, would like to receive a proper response from Land Rover … WTF !!    Where is the customer service?
“Happy Wife Happy Life”  is not working here.

Update:
    Two visits back to salesperson, three service department visits ( loaner car given), at least 40 Emails and verbal communications with Land Rover Corporate  about the continued problems  ...  Then, the wonderful and persistent “customer care representative” from Land Rover corporate” made good.    
    A total of 15 months passed  … received a call from the Land Rover dealership General Manager, had a brief discussion to confirm the dissatisfaction and unresolved problems with the 2017 Evoque vehicle, two weeks later a refund check was issued less a prorated use cost (which was reasonable). The vehicle was turned back to that Dealer and the check was received. 
   The “experience”  has come to an end. .

One significant issue.....windshield began leaking and soaked inside of car recently.  Since it had been leaking for a long time undetected and with days, weeks of rain, water was everywhere inside.  Dealership acknowledged Evoque and Discovery model windshield seals were failing.  However, wasn’t considered a recall issue because it wasn’t 100% of vehicles.  Windshields were back ordered though.  Hmm......

Have taken it on very long and short trips, and it has performed well for me. Fuel mileage ranges depending on the trip, but can expect 26 mpg on the highway. Subtracted one start due to maintenance issues with the cooling system; replaced some hoses and the radiator due to slow leaks. Never got stranded, but good to know there's roadside assistance with the CPO package. Probably will purchase at lease end because the new Evoque is a different vehicle from this 2017."

Towed twice in the last year. Complete engine failure, rear brake caliper replaced 7/2019 & again 6/2020 after 3000 more miles. I paid first one, 2nd one Warranty, as something, they don't know what, is causing it to ""stick"".  Prettiest car I have ever owned, but spends more time at the dealership than any car I have owned (I'm 59yrs young). Service dept always says ""can not recreate customer problem"". Do they really not understand when the car arrives on a flat bed tow truck not running that just maybe there is a problem??!! Trading it in end of this month. Found out today the trade in value after just 3 yrs (& did I mention 15,700 original owner miles),  down $34k from what I paid. Absolutely does not hold ANY value. DO NOT BUY IT. JUST PRINT OUT A PHOTO TO LOOK AT. Beautiful car that doesn't want to be driven.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2018,L. Friedman, 11/23/2018,The Elusive Evoque Convertible,5,"Very difficult to find.  Apparently Land Rover doesn't distribute many to the USA. I have never
had so much fun and enjoyment as I have with this vehicle.  At stop lights male and females
give me a thumbs up.  Some roll down their windows and say they have never seen a convertible
Range Rover before.  All seem to agree it is totally gorgeous.  Plus, it is amazing to drive. I am beyond
thrilled with it.

A year has passed since I own this vehicle .  It is hands down the best car I have ever owned.

Just regular maintenance keeps this vehicle running beautifully.  It continues to be an absolute joy to drive.

Overall, very comfortable, solid ride, low wind noise, decent power.  We did opt for the premium with the cold climate package, but getting a luxury car we figured get the amenities we want.  My only issues is that 1st to 2nd gear is a clunky shift.  Seems to be about 25% of the time which is off putting to myself.  A big plus is the servicing on 2018s went to 1 year/16,000 miles.  Our first service was under $250, and our next will be $400, so that was a nice surprise, even cheaper than our Kia.  Plus after getting rear-ended and needing just shy of $20,000 in work done, my wife walked away with only a sore neck, and the dealership was very helpful every step of the way.  Overall we have been very pleased with the purchase, and would recommend to our friends.

Never get one without the lane keeping feature as you can't tell where you are in the lines of the road.  I was worried about getting pulled over and getting a sobriety test as I was never sure it I was over the white line 1 way or the other.  Crude engine, loud as a diesel w/o the economy.  Trans. was jerky in upshifts and downshifts.  Brakes pulsated when applied.  Back seats don't go down in a very small trunk.  Rear seats really arn't usable for people unless the 2 kids are less than 11.  I had it for 8 mos. and 3,811 miles.  Lost like $8,000. on it.  It's like a $1,000. a mo. lease.  Think I'll take a Bently for that-Thank-You very much!  I still celebrated in getting out of it even with the loss !!  The convert. maybe a collectors item, probably only reason I keep it as long as I did.  With lane keeping feature, which mine did Not have, some of you may love this car.  I had the Optional $1,500. extra cost Windsor Leather seats=Very Nice, rich, leather odor.  Only thing that gave me a piece of luxury-in my opinion.

land-rover,range-rover-evoque,2019,Dan Cazukos, 01/21/2019,Very Disappointing Ride on Many Levels,2,"The transmission is horrendous around town. On the highway it’s fine. Otherwise rough shifting and jerking. It has the ZF 9HP transmission which is known to have this issue, it’s been around a long time but has never been fixed. Other bugs are road/wind noise from mirrors, poor storage space, nowhere convenient to put your phone, poor placement of USB ports, seats don’t hug you, the heated windshield option is very irritating and messes with your sight, no Apple CarPlay support, no wireless charging, weak headlights. Didn’t even come standard with universal garage remote or memory seats. The options, safety and tech you get at the SE level are an awful value, you’d get much better tech and options on almost any other brand. What is Land Rover thinking? Very uncompetitive - will be my first and last Land Rover. At least the design is nice (yet getting stale).

I still haven't changed the brakes (and they've got a good amount of life left), transmission shifts very smoothly. Never had a check engine or any issues.

Remember, don't go cheap on your gas quality, and use synthetic oil. change differential fluid every 75,000 miles.

Something very important to me is the fact it is chain driven, so no timing belt change is needed! tough suspension for offroading means very little problems regardless how many potholes you go through (youll feel every bump, but it's made tough). Gold"

I could be happier."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Barry, 06/19/2010,Dreams Can Come True!!!,4,"I purchased this very at a very high mileage and this is significant because it speaks directly to its reliability. Mine has a 73K (highway mileage)when purchased and people ask me if this was a 2010 model. It was customized by previous owner that some of its current features are incorporated in the 2010 models I saw for sale. Awesome SUV in and out. Great sound system, handling and lots of POWER. Quick stopping brakes. Needless to say its a head turner. If you gonna get one get supercharged, that's when you can feel the punch more. Previous owner had no major issues and vehicle is in excellent condition. One problem I have a couple of days ago is tire air sensor is bad. Good resale value."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Brian McK., 08/24/2016,Absolutely fantastic car !!! Beautiful lux used ca,5,"My search was nationwide and I found one with only 49k miles, one owner, 18 LR service records, in the rare and beautiful Rimini Red (only abou t3-4% of RRS's) on Long Island. I added some aftermarket bling of shiny mirror covers, stainless door handles $79 and pillar covers $69 to really set it off. Just the right amount of bling. also added running boards from eBay for $183. Northeast Rovers have them in the exact same pattern and charge $1150...??? Everyone that sees it loves the color and the added bits really make it stand out. I like the panache of a Range Rover in the Midwest. I drive all over from Madison, WI to Morgantown, WV and in 5,000 miles could count the other RR's I saw on the road on one hand. In SoCal you might see that many parked in one LA city block. The ride is smooth and super comfortable and in a late midwest snowstorm of 8-10"" it handled like a champ. Surefooted and secure. comfort and safety are primary concerns for me and being able to get to my destination. On the highway doing a steady 75 mph my gas mileage has actually been a pleasant surprise of 20.7 mpg. I added and aftermarket electronic module for $69 and my highway mileage is now an incredible 23.8 over 2000 miles. City mileage is 17.4 ! If you take it easy and pretend you are back in the 1980's and drive 55 mph you will find the mileage for the highway actually in the 27.5 to 28.3 range for the car. The sound system HarmonKardon is absolutely incredible and thoroughly enjoyed with my extensive music collection. The NAV system which is DVD based is dated and I do not evne use as I use my smartphone for this purpose. the only complaint that I have is the location of the Aux input is bizarrely and awkwardly placed behind the center console and requires connections to be run from the rear seat area to the front for use of my Ipod. Plan on being a RRS guy for life although the stylistic changes made in the 2014 especially to the front end rear ends and with the lights removed too much from the boxy lines and removed some of the character from the car model appearance. Could never afford a new one but a reasobable priced, well cared for car with records is wonderful to own.

Factory DVD system requires headphones with wires, but...they don't come with this $70k+ vehicle.  Adaptive cruise control makes interstate trips a real joy...set your cruising speed and forget about putting your foot on the gas pedal or brake.  Transmission downshifts around town for this heavy SUV take a toll on gas mileage.  Seats are adjustable, but still a little too firm.  Acceleration and exhaust note are great.

I get looks everywhere I go.  The interior really surrounds you and makes you feel like you are part of the car. The only draw back that prevented me from buying it the day that I saw it was the Land Rover's terrible reliability.

The Cayenne is too awkward-looking and cheaply made inside, the BMW X5 is just an AWD car on stills, not an SUV (and too ubiquitous at that). I've put 1K miles on my RRS, problem-free so far. Ride quality is superb. The steering is just right: easy but not overly so. Directional stability is impressive, feels like riding on rails. Build quality is excellent. I'm glad I opted for the supercharged version with all the bells and whistles (DVD at rear including) in the limited edition trim, it does give you that feeling of being treated as someone special."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,kungpao, 08/27/2005,New purchase,4,"Gorgeous car to drive and very luxurious interior.  My favorite is the body style.  I looked at several other luxury cars and when this version of the Range Rover came out I was enamored with the price point and I already owned a Land Rover Discovery so I traded it in for this one.  Body style really mattered to me so I loved this when it came out.  After all the bells and whistles/dvd/rear entertainment/aspen leather/bluetooth/navigation/heated seats etc...It came out to be 63k. It could stand to be a bigger as far as the rear cargo area is concerned, but if I had wanted the LR3 I would've had to give up the rear body style and it was just too boxy for my taste."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,a.ash., 09/24/2005,vibration.,3,"I love to keep it, But the dealer couldn't fix steering vibration for the fifth time, car factory adjustments is good for only 4 to 5 thousand miles, I'll try to call land rover again to get it fix. or call my lawyer."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,IROC, 10/21/2005,Computer Issues,3,"Bought the car 2 weeks ago, has been in the shop the last week because the stereo and navigation system keep going on and off.  The service people can't figure out the problem and seem like they are clueless all around.  Have always owned BMW's and regret switching.  I would wait a year before I bought this vehicle, let them work the kinks out.  Car is new so they are trying to fix problems on the fly."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,WWOOSSH, 11/03/2005,A Need For Speed,4,So far this vehicle has been the best performing SUV I have ever owned.  I thought my Cadillac CTSV was fast.  But the Range Rover Sport Supercharged now sits in the garage where the CTSV rested.  Kudos to Land Rover for an exceptional vehicle design.  I only wish I could keep my wife from taking it when I'm not looking...
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,RRS enthusiast, 11/03/2005,One of the greatest SUVS ever,4,"I bought my Range Rover Sport back in July and had to search high and low for one and use a dealer who is not a new Land Rover dealer. My local dealer told me they couldn't get me one. The SUV itself is great, however there are a few minor adjustments that could be made to make it even better. But overall it is fun to drive, everyone who sees it is amazed by it and very few people have them which is better. I have owned numerous SUV's and this is the best by far. It definitely beats its big brother the HSE as well as it is sportier and more fun to drive"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,LovemyRRS, 12/15/2005,This Awesome Range Rover Beats My Old X5,4,"I was fairly satisfied with my old X5 BMW until I drove this awsome vehicle.  It fits like a glove with a solid luxurious interior and confident road position.  I was particularly impressed with performance during our first snow storm when I engaged the terrain response system.  The Rover grabbed the road like a tank and showed no sign of slipping or sliding despite icy conditions.  Any vehicle this complex is bound to have some adjustment issues, and the dealer has been very attentive.  It stimulates autophile interest, and I have yet to see another one on the road."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Mountainman, 12/15/2005,Don't use a shotgun to kill flies.,4,"First and foremost, this is a luxury OFFROAD vehicle. Its onroad performance is on par with the best, but when ice hits the mountains or it rains buckets, I remember why I bought the RRS. I've been places on my property in it, that I'd only been able to hike into before. The interior is ergonomically sound and beautifully executed. The subsystems work quite well and most of the complaints I've heard come from folks who, seemingly, didn't bother to read the manual (s). Also, I don't mind the ""bling"" factor, but don't use the 20"" wheels offroad, or you'll run the risk of pinching a rim.  Overall, the RRS is head and shoulders above the rest.  If you want a luxury car, buy one, an SUV,the RRS "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Dave W, 12/27/2005,"Beats the competition, hands down!",4,"When I first saw the RRS I knew this was the one.  I remain impressed with the AWD technology as well as the verifiable reputation that Land Rover has for ""getting you there and back"" This is one of those cars that after you lock it and walk away, you look over you shoulder to check it out."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Freddie, 12/30/2005,Super Duper Charged,4,"After one week of driving this car, i am amazed at what it can do. The performance and handling are amazing. I looked at other performance SUVs and I know I made the right choice. The truck is fully loaded and is fun to drive. You have the feeling of complete control while driving."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,bp, 01/01/2006,FUN FUN FUN,3,"Traded in a Volvo XC90 for this Sport and that was a great decision.  Drives wonderfully and is a SOLID vehicle.  Love the nav sys., sat. and voice command.  British accent is so cool!"

Best in its class, best on the road"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Flyer, 01/03/2006,Best of Breed,4,"This is the fifteenth Land Rover I have had include RRs, Disco, D-90s and even another Sport.  It is the fastest, best equipped, smartest looking vehicle LR has made.   It performs well in all modes and brings to the driving experience the combination of luxury and on/off road performance with several driving options.  "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Charlie, 01/19/2006,My RRS HSE,4,"I bought this truck the weekend it was available to the public back in July of 2005.  I can't tell you the goose bumps I'd get when people on the street turned their heads to check it out, saying, ""I thinks that's the NEW Range Rover Sport"", and ""NICE TRUCK!""  I still have the same sense of excitement every time I start the ignition now at 5,500 miles as I did the day I bought it!  If you are looking for a sports sedan - scrap that - a sports car feel but in a full-time all wheel drive luxury SUV, this is your vehicle.  I challenge you this...if you have the means, just test drive it and I bet you buy one."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,jjs57, 01/23/2006,Spot On,4,"This vehicle was bought to replace the Lexus GX 470, it is far superior to the Lexus and it a real pleasure to drive. They thought of everything, already own the Range Rover and could not be happier with the new body style and cockpit design."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,jenni, 02/04/2006,awesome drive,4,"this is truly the most incredible vehicle i have ever driven.  when you drive it you do not want to get out!  However, It drinks alot of gas. Awesome car!"

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Jim D, 03/14/2006,Bullet proof,4,I bought two for my business. Both have had zero issues.  Handling not as sharp as my old FX35 but the car feels a lot more expensive.
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Happy Camper, 03/15/2006,Nice Sled,4,"I grabbed one of the first Sports to hit the lot in LA and have zero regrets.  This SUV is a superb driving machine.  But it's not until you het the rain, mud, snow, and ice that you know you got what you paid for - its off-road prowess is unequalled.  An unsurpassed engineering marvel!  And it looks and drives great, too.  Handles like a sport car and accelerates like one, also."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Poloboxer, 04/25/2006,Great Mix,4,"RRS feels so solid and has great acceleration.  The ride is a little stiff, but the payoff is the sport car like handling.  Very comfortable for its size - top quality materials!!!"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Brian, 06/01/2006,loving it,4,"Just took a quick road trip in my new supercharged sport and I LOVE IT!  I wasn't sure about buying an SUV but since my needs were changing & a RS4 no longer made sense I went looking for a sport SUV.  The Cayenne-S drive was a disappointment and the X5 doesn't really have enough room so the only option was the RR sport super.  Having gone on a road trip there is no question this was the right choice.  I wanted performance & this is total performance.  Acceleration, handling, braking everything is exceeding my hopes.  The interior is beautiful but the drive is what really counts.  If the maintenance isn't a prob this will easily be the best SUV for those that really wanted a sports car. "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Anela Olsen, 07/07/2006,Very satisfied,4,I owned a 2000 Range Rover and had nothing but problems with it but bought the new sport and love it the look is so sporty it looks very classy. I like it better than the big big body. 
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,rdnyc, 07/23/2006,"got the replacement, still suspicious!",2,Got my HSE in June 05 and had nothing but problems since day one culminating in total suspension collapse at 50 mph. Dealership replaced car and have so far done 4k miles without a problem. Keeping my fingers crossed.
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Tsai, 08/20/2006,Bonatti Grey RRS SUPERCHARGED,4,"Great vehicle, fun to drive, strong performance, great handling and turns heads everywhere I go. I have only had one consistent problem and that is a ""Faulty suspension"" indicator that keeps coming on and locking the vehicle in standard height. I have to then restart the car in order to get it to go away. It's finicky and can happen several times in a day. Other than that, one of the best vehicles I ever bought."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Aaron Yeung, 07/04/2005,2006 Range Rover Sport HSE Review,4,This has to be the best vehicle Land Rover has come out with.  The engine (4.4L) and transmission are improvements from the 4.4 and 4.6 L engines of the Land Rover Discovery II and IIa (1999 to 2004).  The smooth ride rivals that of the Lexus GX470.  The interior is well-appointed.
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Josh Williams, 07/05/2005,Fun To DRIVE,4,This veh is a great joy to drive. I think this is one of the BEST veh Land Rover has made.
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,maria , 07/16/2005,My baby buoy!!!,5,"I traded in my 05 ford mustang gt.For this 06 range rover sport. At first when i saw this vehicle it was love at first sight! To ever think i could afford a vehicle like this was just unimaginable. The ride, safety,and looks are out of this world. This is the best riding vehicle i have ever had and this makes 29 cars in my life time. We love it so much we thought of buying another one. For my husband. The horsepower is also 300 like the mustang so i didnt loose that.But the room is worth the trade. The options my range rover sport has is incredible too. Love the navigation system.The lights that move as you drive.Thats a plus too.This vehicle is the best! I cant' rate it high enough! I just love it!"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Faisal Farooq, 07/16/2005,Best of the Best,4,"I traded in my Escalade ESV for this RR Sport.  I just love it.  Better Ergonomics, much better quality and handling.  "

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,3lakeswi, 08/02/2005,Supercharged Would be a 10,4,"So far I love my RRS. The only thing I feel it needs is more hp - although more hp is available for a price. Compared to Porsche Cayenne V8, FX45, BMW X5 4.4 - this was by far the best ride for the money. Just coming up on 1000 miles and have loved every minute of it. It will be interesting to see how it works in Northern Wisconsin winters with the stock tires. Also hope the trade-in value will rival that of BMW."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Gary A., 08/09/2005,The Ultimate Rover,4,"This vehicle performs incredibly on any road conditions.Very responsive both in steering, handling, and breaking. I traded in my LR-3 to get into this vehicle. Although the same engine, RR Sport handled better and felt lighter (though RR Sport is about 500 lbs. lighter).The interior is impecable and with the ease of control access in ergonomics and voice activation.I do miss some of the LR3 features such as the additional cup holders located at all side doors and center console.Additionally,the ashtray pullouts in the Sport are limited to only one which cannot accomodate coins.I really enjoy my RR Sport. Get this vehicle with the luxary and cold climate package.It looks cheap/dif without it."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Aman Sabharwal, 08/10/2005,Turning Heads,4,"I am very happy with my new RRS. It is sturdy, and the build quality is superb.  It is fun to drive and fun to drive over things.  Nice turining radius and the air suspension is nice.  I applaud LR for using the Denso Navi system (like lexus).  Unlike porsche and other makes, there is no cheap plastic inside."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Darlene, 09/15/2005,Range Rover Sport,4,"Very sporty, fun to drive, A little small inside, but comfortable. Quick acceleration, turns on a dime. Super stereo system."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,reg, 09/16/2005,The Best of the Best,5,"So far I have had the privilege of a number of Discos, 2 RR, and LR3 and now the RRS.  It is truly fantastic.  Land Rover has always made a vehicle which truly could work offroad (unlike so called ""Sport untility vehicles"").  The RR has always been an elegant working vehicle.  Now they have managed to incorporate a sportscar into the package.  There are no comparable vehicles on the market today although there are many wannabes!  If you want true performance, offroad capabilities and luxury the RRS can do it all."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,G Fowler, 10/13/2005,RR SC Sport,4,"had no problems , feels very tight and fast for a RR. Very pleased so far."

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,RovX2, 11/24/2005,One was not enough,4,"We bought our Sport in Sept. for me.  The ride is smooth and the pick up is excellent.  I love our car, but my wife loves it more and I couldn't get her out of it so that I could drive it.  So we just bought her one also.  Two is definitely better than one."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Bart Chamberlain, 12/05/2005,An incredible vehicle!!,4,"I've owned my Range Rover Sport for a month...simply an unbelievable ride.  It's a perfect combo of luxury, refinement, and sportiness packed into one vehicle. Gets looks everywhere I  go and is a true joy to drive."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,James Daniel, 12/18/2005,My first Range Rover,4,"This is my first RR purchase. The reliability has been superb at 7000 miles.  What a looker! Turns heads of all ages. Maybe too small up front for a big guy (6'4"", 220lbs.), however controls and seats are top notch. Fuel mileage has averaged about 14 city and 20+ highway. I have tried regular gas for several tankfuls without any noticeable problems. Has the best nav system on the market, period. The infusion of BMW engineering (RR's previous owner) and Ford's money (RR's current owner) has created a desirable, competitive and trustworthy product line."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Randy, 12/18/2005,New Range Rover Sport HSE in California,4,"I have about 2,000 miles on the new HSE. Terrific SUV. Previously have had Yukon, GMC Envoy, and BMW X-5 3.0. This vehicle makes the others look, drive and feel cheap IMO. Love the styling, the ""Luxury Package"" option is a MUST! Much better grade/quality of leather in the luxury option, as well as the ""turning"" bi-xenon headlights. Wonderful german-made ZF 6 speed automatic. Great air suspension ride. Also have this same supension in my Bentley Continenatal GT and Mercedes S55AMG. Makes THIS S.U.V. drive like a car, not like a truck. IMO, RIP-OFF $130 for injection molded plastic ""cradle"" that you MUST have to mount the Nokia phone to this model! I love this SUV!"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Razor, 12/18/2005,Better than ever expected.,4,"I had previously owned an LR Discovery and wasn't too thrilled with the design or performance.  I thought I'd never own another LR until I saw the Sport.  I had to see it.  Then had to drive it.  Then had to own it.  The car is incredible.  Most nimble SUV on the planet and with classy style to boot.  Plenty of power, interior space, and creature comfort features."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,platnim, 12/20/2005,RR Sport SC,4,"I was hesitant to trade in my M3 for a family car, but have been extremely pleased with my RR Sport SC. It has more than enough power/performance at any speed to satisfy, has the ability to travel in any enviroment, seats five and has the ""park it in the front"" apeal to the valet parkers anywhere I go in sin city. Who could ask for more?"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,billb, 01/14/2006,RR Sport Rocks,4,"Simply a pleasure...Everthing about the car says luxury and cornering in this vehicle is a breeze.  This SUV is made for someone looking for that ""sport car feel"" with all the off road capability.  To me that gives you the best of both worlds.  That being said if you need the the absolute best from both worlds don't expect this car to deliver.  It is made to handle almost anything not outperform everything. "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,John Paul, 01/25/2006,Roving Rover,5,I can't say enough about how pleased I am with my Sport SC. Great fit and finish iside and out. Better than the 1997 full size Rover I owned which treated me well. I own a Vesuvius Orange and it turns heads wherever I go.  
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,PANOMARK, 01/27/2006,Cool Ride,4,"Great ride on the road and get lots of complements. Very comfortable and I love the looks.  Not easy to lay down the second seat due to front seat leaning back to far. If you don't need lots of room in the rear, it's a great vehicle.  Compared to the BMW, much more practicle and will keep it's value."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,smith, 01/29/2006,The best,4,"This land rover is just like its older brother but is more sportier in the inside and out. It delivers the best quality performance you would like in the price range for this SUV. During the test drive, we went on a 70 degree angle which I thought we were going to tip but the sales lady assured me that these cars were made to do this off road activity and give a sporty atitude at the same time. It's not very powerful, I would compare the power to a BMW X5 3.0. However the Supercharged is very powerful like the X5 4.8. I give this car an A+ in all its capabilities and performance.  "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,Dave, 01/29/2006,Very Happy,4,"I love my car!  I was really close to buying a garden variety 750i, but am so glad I got on the long waiting list for the Sport.  Every time I drive it I get asked about it, and subsequent nods of approval.  The interior is comfortable, and the industrial look rubber mats are perfect.  The touch screen navigation is much better than last year's knob control, and the variable traction settings worked flawlessly on my road trip from Portland down to the OC.    The new Jag engine concerned me while I was waiting for the car, but it is silky smooth.  Also, the infamous British electrical system has not given me one problem, so far so good.  All I can say is that I am one happy owner.Buy this car"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,lee crosse, 01/31/2006,Great Car,4,"I love being in my RRS. Writing from the UK where I drive a diesel. 29 mpg on a decent run. After 24,000  miles in 7 months (including a 2500 mile round trip to Poland after having taken delivery of the car 2 days before) I can safely say this is the best car I've driven. Quiet and smooth and when cruise control set to 100mph on German autobahns it's a dream. Very few niggles in my first 24,000 miles: warning lights often come on for no reason; dipping wing mirrors sometimes don't come back up, and problems finding the correct snow chains. But otherwise this car is FAB!!!!"

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,MGB, 03/06/2006,Our dream suv !!,4,Could not be happier with this purchase. I traded in my BMW X5 4.4 toward the purchase of this and I am so pleased to have done so. Never thought a Land Rover would drive even better than a BMW! The whole family loves it. The Best SUV I have ever owned. (Have owned 9 Previously). This vehicle is incredibly well engineered. Serious Curb Appeal! Can't Wait to take the first long trip with it. Only Problem with it is you don't realize how fast you are moving in a nearly 6000 LB vehicle because it is so smooth and quiet.
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,udman2, 03/06/2006,Looks great but disappointed!,4,"Love the looks.  Had to change out the Continental Tires that were stock.  3 of the 4 had side wall issues.  Dealership said must be abuse but I am 46, driven all prior cars with no accidents, no abuse and have done nothing but normal with this vehicle.  Chromed wheels at same time.  Looks great.  Went off=road 2 times into real estate development on new roads just cleared.  Both times in area where several other vehicles had 0 problems the RRS had issues and damage underneath.  CHEAP< CHEAP ALLUMINUM shield (not steel) just crumples if contact anything.  Underside sits so low (even w/ veh in hi) had damage at 2 - 3 mph over cleared area.   0 issues with Suburban. "

Very quite interior with just the right amount of engine noise under hard acceleration. Navigation system has worked perfectly every time. Exterior design is very eye catching. This vehicle does one thing most other import luxury SUV can't it is rated to tow 7700 pounds. No real problems in almost 3000 miles, only a check engine light that went off on its own ( I think it was the gas cap not on correctly) and a rear speaker cover that keeps falling off. "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,oohmali, 06/26/2006,vroom vroom,5,Awesome ride! Superior handling on city streets. Had somewhat of a slight inconvenience occur while out shopping. Had to FOLLOW the culprits. They were driving a Chevy Impala (Pursuit Package). I was driving my RRS. This baby gets UP!!! I was highly impressed with the performance of this sweet SUV. Only problems have been the reverse tilt-mirror feature activates on its own on some occasions. The suspension warning light occasionally activates and will not allow me to change the height of the vehicle without turning the vehicle off and then restarting it.
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,happy, 06/27/2006,excellent early experience,4,"I have had the vehicle for just over two months and 3000 miles.  I have been a long time SUV owner(14 years; five other vehicles), most recently in an FX 45. I spent considerable time ""shopping"" the Land Rover, BMW and Lexus vehicles. This vehicle was far and above the superior in the group.  Recently took a 1200 mile trip with the family and found the vehicle to be quite comfortable and a pleasure to drive.  At this point I would highly recommend strong consideration of this vehicle."

It handles great (for an SUV), feels solid and tight, looks great (you can judge for yourself) --- and wraps you in luxury and more options than I can count.    The sound system is outstanding - the best I have ever had in a vehicle (including high-end Mercedes).   This is my first Land Rover product and I have been very impressed by the overall quaity of the interior and exterior fit and finish, and the overall feeling of sportiness and luxury.   Also, it is actually very spacious on the inside.   "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2006,KRBJr., 10/16/2006,Sport Rocks!,4,Best looking SUV on the planet.  Ride and handling are close to the best as well.  A real head turner with the guts to do more off road than most are willing to try.  A keeper.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,bigpapa, 02/13/2016,"2007 hse commuter, tow, family wagon.",5,"So currently I have had my 07 have for about 2 years. Repairs are all standard maintenance stuff. Brakes, tires, oil etc. 
Find a local to work on these items or do yourself and it saves a bunch. 
The non standard items to watch is #1 the air ride. When air ride goes generally starts as a bag or valve and then will overwork your compressor and you will replace that too... This will run $2500 if you do the bags and compressor at the same time. Brake rotors are another one. If these go use the aftermarket upgrades out as they are far superior to the stock rotors.
Other item is the sidemarker light. 
This this once it goes bad will haunt your dashboard display.  This really needs to be a recall item...
I now have 138000 on my hse and it runs great! I have towed a small bobcat tractor in excess of 6000 lbs. Even though the vehicle is rated for 7700 the hitch is probably only good for 5500 as you have to use an extender which lowers the capacity rating. I really use my hse for daily driver, heavy hauler and Saturday night pimp whip (so it has been called). Don't let all the negative hype keep you from buying one of these. If you want a ride that makes you feel good, can tow and get you from A to B with some style.... This is the right choice.

This is a heavy car and should have a rear hatch that opens and closes via remote.  Also, I've already been through 2 sets of brakes and tires.  The dealership said this is normal.  Ugh.  A heavy car like the RR Sport really blows through the brake pads.  I had them replaced less than a year ago and they are already squeaking.  You can hear me braking from a mile away.  Kind of embarrassing."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Surprised, 01/09/2007,Perfection in motion,4,"This car has been perfect for me. I was originally looking for a sport sedan in the 50k range, but I couldn't find anything that fit my personality.  I wanted something that was comfortable and fun to drive but stood out.  I found the comfort in one car, the drivability in another.  But in this Range Rover Sport, I found both of those attributes plus the X factor in appearance.  This SUV really stands out.  I get looks and compliments everywhere I go.  Its big enough to look rugged and tough as well as being sleek enough to look sexy. Land Rover could have not made a better SUV. When I tell someone that I own a Range Rover, they congratulate me for getting the Sport and not the other one."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Dr. Morton, 08/04/2007,All Wheel Drive Bentley,4,"I recently purchased the RRS SC and this SUV has blown my mind.  I had seen them around, found them flashy and even considered buying one.  However, I never became serious about it until a friend of mine brought his home.  The first time I climbed into the RRS I was instantly impressed.  The classy styling on the outside transitioned well into the interior.  I was at the dealership the next week and now I'm a proud owner of the RRS SC.  If you can fit the bill, this car is worth adding to the collection.  I drove the BMW 7 Series for years, and I don't think I'll ever go back."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Jim, 04/14/2009,Outstanding Vehicle,4,"I have used the vehicle to travel 3- 400 highway miles a week. I have towed 20' boat 300 miles w/o effort, pulled boat full of water from sandy beach without trouble. I have driven through sandy orange groves...the vehicle performs as advertised. I use the lowering function for easier entry for the ladies, (still too high for elderly to easily access)parking in the garage and when using drive up banking services. I currently have 54,000 miles on the vehicle, 0 problems and I have averaged 18.6 mpg."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Jamie , 01/29/2009,Worst SUV ever,2,"I've had my Range Rover Sport for 15 months and I can't wait to get rid of the vehicle. I bought the SUV new and I've had radio complications, had to purchase 4 new tires, and replace brake pads after the 1st year.  That's not counting the times the SUV was in the shop to reset signal lights. I understand you have regular wear and tear maintenance problems, but I've never purchased tires or brakes within one year of buying a new vehicle. When I asked the dealer was this normal, their response was ""yes"". The back seat room is ridiculous (very uncomfortable) and the navigation system is a joke."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,G'day, 07/23/2008,Luxury at a price,3,"Well it's an eye catcher at a steep price.  A princely car, gas guzzler,  but the confidence you get when in it is not describable. It more than compensates for the shortcomings.  It cuts through snow effortlessly. It accelerates beautifully, lifting its almost 4 ton weight effortlessly, but it's not a sports car. Handling in corners calls for caution.  It has some plasticky attachments which lower the overall quality together with the fact that it doesn't come with bells and whistles of Japanese cars.  Eg the tail gate can be fully automated and there can be a rear camera without paying an arm and a foot. The power and control is great! Highly maneuverable for its size. Great car to own."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,OrthoDr, 09/11/2008,Nightmare. Don't Fall for the Looks!,1,"Despite my better judgment, advice of knowledgeable friends and my own happy history with German cars (Porsche, BMW) I went with the RR.  In the shop about 50% of the time: suspension, brakes, engine light etc, etc.  I now know that any real car enthusiast snickers when they see some moron (like myself) driving a Range Rover down the street, knowing they succumbed to great looks, marketing and desire to exhibit one's W-2 in vehicle form.  Please don't, unless your RR technician is a starving family member.  Buy a BMW X-5 or Cayenne instead.  And yes, I told you so."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,JBLove, 11/23/2007,Great SUV,4,"This is a great vehicle. It has all the options that you would want and has a great design/look.  Off road abilities coupled with the on road manners make this SUV a winner. Gas mileage is so-so but a good trade off and it is a 60k car. Has a very solid feel.  My suggestions:  one locking glove box, a little larger seat with the lower seating surface a bit deeper (like my 2002 7 series BMW), a navigation system that you can input on the fly, and easier to reach (when the door is closed) seat controls."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,blkwheels, 12/18/2006,First time to buy RR SC so far so good.,5,"I was looking for the RR Sport SC when I bought my gl450 but was to nervous to consider LR due to neg reputation. They just kept catching my eye and when I drove it, I had to buy it. What a car! Love the look, cockpit feel, howling engine and how it rides. A part is on order for the pass side dual ac not cooling but for now I'm loving every bit of my new ride. I only have 1k miles. I passed the gl450 to my wife. Which is also great suv but totaly diff than the RR Sprt SC."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Sin City Ferrari, 01/01/2008,Electronic gremlins,3,"With 13 months of ownership I can honestly say I'm seriously debating whether to get another one when the lease is up. The recent electronic gremlins, engine light turns on and off, and noises the vehicle is exhibiting is suprising for a vehicle costing 75k+. One day the radio and nav didn't work; I was ready to drop it off at the dealership when it miraculously started working again. The engine light intermittently turns on and off. There's also this ""crunching"" noise when I drive over large bumps. Definitely will have the dealership look into this. On a positive note, I enjoy the supercharged motor, the exterior styling and interior ergonomics. "

Performance: this winter had 3 major snow storms, had to be pushed out of snow three times in this ""go anywhere, do anything"" vehicle. Woefully underpowered, acceleration terrible, Burns gas like Boeing 757, I'm at the gas station more than the office, handles like an 18 Wheeler. Both front/rear brakes need replacement in 20,000 miles-not covered under warranty. Needs ""realignment"" about every 7-8k miles (not covered under warranty). Interior: displays are small, difficult to read, green backlite awful, ""mahogany"" console trim so uneven you can cut yourself, bill Gates couldn't figure out electronics, nav system is a joke."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,RT, 02/18/2007,"So far, awsome!",4,I was really in the market for a V-8 SUV and have owned a 3.0L X5 for the last few years.  I loved the new 2007 X5 look and on my way to order one last weekend I decided to check out the Range Rover Sport.  One drive and I was hooked!  What a ride!  If you are thinking of purchasing a new SUV you must checkout the RRS!  BMW has a great SUV in the X5 but the RRS was better in so many ways I could not pass it up!  
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Richard, 03/14/2007,I'm Ridin' Dirty,4,"I just purchased my Sport very recently; but I'm already in love with it.  My initial city/road mix is yielding 18 mpg, which is as good as my 6 year old Volvo S80...but a much cooler ride.  I have more features than I ever imagined and even added a few extra items such as the side molding, wind deflectors and rear lamp guards.   This is truly the way to roll; even if you'll never get off road with it.   As well, the service and treatment for purchasing a product like this was as expected.   And the bottom line, the gas mileage is weak, but if you have to worry about gas prices when you're buying a SUV for $62k...you shouldn't be buying it.  My favorite vehicle of 28 I've had!!"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Gordon, 06/15/2007,Best SUV for many reasons,4,"A car or SUV can always say it does something better than some other vehicle. It's a collection of hits or misses that makes a car great though, and the Range Rover Sport Supercharged has more Hits than misses. This SUV is unbelievable to drive along winding mountain roads. Power is there whenever you need it and brakes are better than almost every other car our there This thing stops faster than my friends Mazda 3 compact car!  I"

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2007,Chris P., 12/12/2018,"Fancy, maybe a little to fancy",4,"We bought the car used back in 2016 so this is an update and even though it is older it still has a lot of the comforts of a brand new luxury car. Now that Bluetooth is standard on new cars it is annoying sometimes since it’s older. It still rides smooth and looks amazing for a 2007. After about a year though the air suspension compressor needed to be changed. Then after fixing that a year later the starter went out. If you can do these things yourself it’s not to bad but a dealership is going to charge upwards of $1000. Great car just can be expensive.

I have a 3 year old and 4 dogs and have no complaints.  Fits my needs and this Alabama girl is not afraid to drive it in the snow or mud...hence what its made for. "

It is everything you would wish for, except the gas mileage. First you have to use premum. Then the engine is a v-8 so it burns a lot of gas which I don't like about my Range Rover.  Everthing else is excellent!"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,Peter, 09/16/2009,From good to bad to worse...sad but true,3,"This is an update to my April 2009 review.  Unfortunately I have no good news to report. My ownership experience continues to sour.  The clunking in the suspension returned again a month ago. The saga continues. Apparently the dynamic suspension is malfunctioning and the vehicle has been in the shop for two weeks now.  Not sure when the parts will arrive and will require a diassembly of the chassis to repair. I have now tallied the cost to repair all of these warranty items at almost $5,000 in the first two years of ownership.  Cat converter $1,450, sway bar repair $475, Suspension actuator $2,750. This vehicle will be turned in at end of lease, cost and reliability problems abound"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,Peter, 12/25/2009,Said Goodbye,3,Turned the vehicle in a couple weeks ago 5 months before the end of the lease.  Notwithstanding the fact that I was at the end of my mileage the continual reliability problems were just too much to take.  Since purchase this vehicle would be difficult to start once in a while and it became more frequent over the past few months.  After the suspension problems a few months back the ride was never as compliant as it was when I purchased.  Became very harsh and vechile began to rattle a bit at times.   I am very saddened by this turn of events.  I was thrilled for the first year but it ended in a most unappealing way.  I wish Land Rover luck under their new ownership.

They did not take it back the 5th time saying Land Rover said it was normal to have some water enter the suv. I spoke with Land Rover and they looked into it but have now closed my case saying ""normal"". This is not normal by any standards. Land Rover needs to build a better car! I only bought it because I loved the look of it. I am filing for help under the TX Lemon Law in hopes that they buy back the car so I can get into another car, not a land rover!!"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,David, 01/23/2009,Same Old Range Rover,3,Best Looking SUV in its class. Too bad Land Rover has not fixed it's mecanical issues. Wait till you get to 25000 mile and the dealer tells you that you need new brakes all around. Dealer won't help nor will Land Rover. They claim this is normal wear and tear. Right!
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,DCorey, 03/04/2010,Sad to Go!,4,"This RRS-SC has been an excellent car. Time to turn it in and will miss it. The performance and all around cool factor of this car compensates  for the back seat comfort, quirky nav system and cumbersome tailgate. This is my wife's kid hauler, but I drive it every chance I get. No problems with anything other than a window lift in the first month. If you want to drive an SUV with SWAG this is the one."

I replaced a wiper blade once after it froze to the glass last winter (it was - 25 degrees). It has been unbelievably reliable and a joy to drive. My maintenance is complimentary, so the only thing I've paid for is tire rotations. If you want the most dynamic, safe, and enjoyable sport utility vehicle, you would be doing yourself an incredible disservice to not consider a Land Rover. I average 17mpg and I'm a pretty aggressive driver. If I set the cruise control at 73mph, I average 21-22mpg. And that's from a 4.4 liter V8 with 300hp. Eat your heart out, Mercedes."

No problem, put in sport mode and it winds to 7000 rpm like NOW and you are flying. Want to climb an impossibly steep trail? No problem, put it in low range and up you go. Brakes feel like you threw out an anchor. Big control knobs and buttons fit my stubby fingers and just feel right. I love this rig."

RRS drives like a dream, it's a luxury SUV that actually handles all the elements and gives you the power & control all at the same time. I miss my M3 but after driving the RRS, I've found a new love. Also use to drive a Land Cruiser & compared to the RRS, the LC drives heavy & is hard to steer. It truly amazes me how easy the RRS steering is, it's effortless. it doesn't feel heavy or huge.  1 thing that used to bug me were the lines in the windshield (for defrosting), but you get use to it.  Also, it's common knowledge not to buy an V8 SUV if you care about gas mileage!"

There are no concerns about reliability for those of you who don't know land rover have the best four wheel drive system available.  Why do you think BMW bought Land Rover years ago.  For the four wheel drive system that they think is in the X-5.  Yeah right, the X5 couldn't hang with this vehicle at all."

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,bestdeal, 09/17/2008,So far so good,4,Range Rovers have a history of failing over time. The $6000 dealer cash sealed the deal for me. Although the Range depreciates faster than any other luxury SUV I feel it is still a good value. It just needs to be taken into consideration before purchased. Residual value is low. Don't let the TMV fool you!  You can get a Range for well under factory invoice. I got mine for $5500 because of the dealer cash.The advertised $795 with no money down can be beaten by a large margin!

The horn is another nightmare , good luck finding it when you really need it.The design of the interior is idiotic as well.Where is the button for the rear hatch? Opening the rear hatch is a challenge in itself. There is nothing nice to say about this truck and the next 30 months of this lease are going to be painful !!!"

Tried all the competitors and for the best choice for performance plus off road capabilities this vehicle won the contest.

The exterior is great, interior, everything is within reach.  I was quite concerned about reliability when I purchased but with almost 8000 miles, I have only had 2 problems.  Sunroof leaks and dealer cannot seem to fix, have replaced seal and sunroof twice but still leaks in the rain and car wash (this seems to be very common with Rover from what I have read on line).  Rear door seals falling off.  Only draw back is everything has to be ordered by the dealer and takes a couple of weeks to arrive.  Fuel mileage is not bad at all, I am averaging 18/19 city/hwy mix.

Don't be deceived by the scary reliability ratings, I've had more trouble out of Lexus and BMW products. The vehicles are sometimes quirky, but the issues are small and infrequent. Plus the dealer is great to work with and always gives you a Rover loaner.  Plus, this is the best looking SUV on the market. I have never had so many compliments.

Thank God Ford made a better engine, my disco was weak in the power area and this machine is a powerhouse.  It's not as interactive as a BMW, where all the electronics almost know what you want and everything works together, but it is a wonderful machine in it's own rights.

I have seen these with others on this site...suspension clunking in the shop twice before they could figure it out, check engine light on and off several times in the shop firt time for PCV valve then again for a new catalytic converter.

Selected RRS S/C in Black/Ivory. Very impressed with it - don't miss the X5. Drove it recently in heavy snow - it was better than my X5 was. Its also firm and fast on the open road.  Its not cheap on gas - but then there are other brands that cost alot less that have worse gas mileage. Doing about 5mpg less than the X5 was overall.  Did'nt find it slow to heat up, nor difficult to aviod the heated elements in windshield. Controls are all easily reached.  Great SUV - don't hesitate any longer!"

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,Dennis, 04/18/2008,Just pure fun - AMAZING,4,"This car is so much fun to drive. I replaced my 2004 A8 4.2 with 2007 RRS- SC and this car is truly amazing. I loved my Audi & enjoyed driving it - and this SUV is just as much fun as the A8! I also have a GL 550, but the GL isn't as fun as RRS. GL does have better ride quality - since RRS-SC is a bit stiff - it trades off with RRS' sporty nature & agility. It's a true driver's car. If you are looking for a sexy, sporty, driver-fun car - go for it! but if u are looking for soft, passenger-comfort car, go for the full- size Range Rover."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,ss68, 04/21/2008,Look Forward to Driving,4,This is our 1st luxury SUV. We sat in a number of them at the Chicago Auto show and had made up our minds before driving it. The dealer let us use one for the weekend and it sealed the deal. Also had a auto show discount going on. So far we have put on about 2000 miles and have not had any issues. The stereo is amazing. 
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2008,Peter, 05/11/2008,Outstanding,4,"Wonderful ownership experience thus far.  Was skeptical about purchasing because of historical reliability ratings.  I have been very pleased with the performance and quality of this vehicle.  No problems at all thus far. On of the best handling SUVs out there and acceleration/stopping power is superb.  Great off road (put some Nokians on for winter and off road use).  For a perfect blend of performance, styling and off road capability, this is the best offering available, in my humble opinion.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2009,Tb, 07/12/2020,DONT BUY USED,2,"I bought a 2009 Range Rover sport hse used for a cheap price with 173,000 miles and it has been pretty bad this last year. The key fob broke soon after I got it and it cost close to $500 to get a new one at the dealership. The sunroof broke and let’s water in whenever it rains and is about $3000-4000 fix at a dealership. At around 184,000 miles the gauge cluster is now broken and causes the car to say “vehicle system fault” or “hdc system unavailable” and the car will not start. I have tried many things to bypass this failure to start by leaving the key in the ignition for 30 seconds to 1 minute and usually the car will start. It also does this from time to time when I am driving and the infotainment system shuts off and the hazard flashers come on and the turn signals do not work. After about 14 months of ownership I have decided to get rid of the car. I have a love hate relationship with this car. It looks very beautiful but can cause the biggest headaches if you are too cheap and buy a used one for under market value which can lead to dealing with many problems.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2010,M. Gilmore, 09/28/2010,I love this vehicle!,4,"Even though I owned an LR3 with no reliability probs I was a touch nervous having read other reviews about the RR Sport. Sitting in the tow truck on my way back to the dealer after one week I was not too happy! Turned out a faulty cell in battery was why my car was dead. Changed it and since then a dream come true. I got black on black with the contrast stitching (a must) looks beautiful. Drives like a dream, such a comfortable seating position and great power I never want to get out of it. If you are thinking of this vehicle just get it, you deserve it. I have had only fun driving since the battery debacle of first week and highly recommend this car. Looks great inside and out,I love it!"

I love how the car handles; spent the first few nights taking the coast road home [Stop reading here if you only want favorable words]. The electronic/software issues on the other hand, are now making me think this is the Microsoft Vista of automobiles; nothing quite operates the same two times in row. Manufacture date is 09/09. This is my first LR vehicle, having spent the last 10 years as a Lexus owner with nary a cold, so maybe my expectations are too high. I'd like to loan LR the top notch Test & QA team from my company for a few months. Taking the car into the dealer for 7 issues (all but one are electronic/software related)."

The 2010 RRS has it all! Extended leather opt gives it as good a fit and finish as any MB, Caddy, or Lexus.  Ride quality is definitely sporty and European, but not at the expense of luxury, and the exhaust note is aggressive but subtle.  Surround camera system is a bit hokey until you need to parallel park in a tight spot. After a year and a couple dozen test drives the 2010 RRS beat the competition.  I've had it for a month and still tell people I like better the more I drive it. "

Fantastic driving experience as it is heavy and a very comfortable ride - and attractive.

The Harman Kardon sound system is the best I've heard in a vehicle.
It is very difficult to criticize the driving experience.
The drawback is the numerous service aggravations which have motivated me to sell it prematurely.
For a vehicle of this quality with 50,000 km, it has been in the shop far too many times."

My RRS HSE is white with a coffee or chocolate interior.  I love this truck.  First, if you were doubtful and have had a few probs, then why did you buy it?  EVERY new vehicle with all the electronics will have degrees of problems.  I had a few issues like some on here, but new it was the computer b/c it would be fine after it had been restarted (the truck), then LR had a computer upgrade and poof!  No more problems at all.  12000 plus miles and riding great!!  It's also the first time my husband asks to take my truck!!  Service has been wonderful and glad I purchased my RRS. "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2010,Joe N, 02/19/2019,My Favorite Mistake,4,"First off Let me say that when my RRSS (Range Rover Sport Supercharged) is working it is the best vehicle I have ever owned. it is keeping it working at 100% that is the issue. There are the annoying things like the rain sensing wipers not sensing rain, to the door locks working when they want to, always in my driveway, never at the airport parking lot; I say ""British Car"" and shrug these off. There are more serious issues like the satellite radio no longer working (cost to fix $700).a suspension airbag leaking causing a compressor failure (cost to fix $1600) to the latest issues which are the supercharger snout bearing failing and the dreaded PCV issue (cost to fix over $2600) Come on JLR, why design an engine where the PCV valve is built into the cam cover and takes about 13 hours to remove and replace due to the supercharger needing to come out? Why didn't you design a replaceable easy to access PCV valve like everybody else? As I said, when she is running well I can carve up the road keeping up with the Corvettes, carry a ton of stuff and go anywhere, all whilst being wrapped in the finest of English interiors. It is just keeping her running at 100% that is an issue. If you want a reliable but boring vehicle that does what this one does but without the bravado of 510 horsepower, get the Lexus LX. If you want to have fun but pull out your hair, get the RRSS. I have been pulling out my hair for over 75000 miles!

It is one of those cars that stands out from the rest. Over all the experience has been positive.
The car has been reliable, except for the earlier problems with the camera system, which I really think you only need the rear camera.
The brakes do wear early, got mine replaced at 21,000 miles."

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2010,LR Newbie, 10/26/2009,What the RRS should always have been...,4,"I always liked the idea of the Range Rover Sport but to me the interior was always too close to the LR3/Discovery and no where near the Range Rover.  The 2010 model has addressed this biggest flaw and at the same time brought the standard model up to a performance level which is worthy of the word ""sport"".  I took delivery on Friday and drove 500 miles over the weekend on a combination of highways and back roads.  The car feels very solid on the highway with great control on the more winding roads and the seats are superb.  Its a big step up in comfort from my old ML550 but performance isn't close to the ML but certainly on the right side of adequate.  "

The front NAV screen / display area went black (came back on next day).  Brought to dealer for inspection..but of course was working then.  This past week the radio audio went out (has not happened twice) came back on the next day and today a Tire Pressure Monitoring System Failure alarm came on.  Back to the dealer tomorrow.  They indicated they need to reprogram the car (and both keys).  I also had a ""Bonnet Open"" alarm.  Fixed by snapping connector back. All this in 6 months."

BUT The first day I drove it my ipod started to play music out of the left speakers only and I got really concerned coz I've heard alot about reliability issues with Land Rover. It worked ok 3 days later so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. The ride is so smooth 90mph feels like 50mph.My one complaint so far is the lack of compartment space.Do away with the cooler! Overall it is an Amazing ride!"

The supercharged engine is an awesome experience to drive. I haven't experienced anything falty with the car yet, but I do have a defect in the wood grain that runs along the left of the center console. Its very noticeable and the dealer agreed to replace that part. My range is metallic black with black upgraded leather package seats and ebony stitching (piano black wood). I sueded my head liner with high quality suede. I would recommend to anyone wih this car to suede the headliner, it makes all the difference in regards to the interior ambiance. Style 7 20'' wheels, all in all great ride."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2010,Laureate2, 10/05/2009,New From the Inside OUt,4,"I remember test driving the first Range Rover Sport, and leaving confused as to how they could name such a slow vehicle ""sport.""  Finally the 2010 version earns the name.  The 5 Liter engine provides plenty of punch which actually seems faster then the 7.2 0-60 listing.  Even better, the interior finally looks and acts like a luxury vehicle.  Big touch screen, leather & wood, keyless entry and the Ipod, USB docks.  I just wish there was a little more differentiation between this one and it's predecessor.  Only a trained and peering eye picks up on the subtle styling cues.  If you're on the fence about this car, have the salesperson take you on the off-road track.  You'll be sold.  Cheers"

My wife couldn't drive it since the seat was stuck farther back that her foot is unable to reach the pedals. Funny! Took it to the dealer and was told they had to order a new motor. Came the new motor after couple of weeks and had it installed. The driver seat still didn't work. LR service then told me that it must be the programming. They were puzzled on how to resolve the issue and kept my car for 2 weeks. Talk about reliability! Now I'm second guessing if this car was truly worth it.  "

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2010,Broskay, 11/23/2009,Nice All Around,4,"I have always wanted a RRS mainly because of its good looks. I decided against buying the 09 model because I considered it not technologically up to date. My 2005 Infiniti FX 35 came with a back up camera, which was still missing in the RRS as at last year. They sure did make up for all the short comings this time around. I really don't have a lot of problems with the fact that the exterior is not significantly differentiated from the old model. I've always considered the exterior look beautiful.I get to take it on a drive to Tennessee this weekend for Thanksgiving and I'm sure it is going to be a fun ride based on what I've experienced cruising around town so far. The drive is really smooth"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2010,BWB RRS HSE, 12/06/2009,Happy So Far,4,"I purchased a new 2010 Black RRS HSE last Nov. 201. It has the ivory leather on ebony carpet, the luxury package, leather package and 20"" silver wheels.  So far I am very happy. It is the first vehicle I have bought where I feel there are no compromises. On the Interstate, 80 mph feels like 50! The sound system is by far the best I have ever experienced. The heated steering wheel is sweet.  Only two nit pics - wish I had about 2"" more leg room and there is no remote start.  I am getting about 18 mpg on the highway traveling at 69 mph and about 15 around town(semi-rural area).  Could have saved $8K for a '09 leftover but felt the '10 was so much improved that it was worth the extra $."

It's Santorini Black with the Black extended leather package, 20"" alloys, HD/Sat. I've owned many luxury SUVs but this one is special. I visited my dealer with the intent of picking up a 2009 full sized RR SC but after seeing the improvements to the Sport, especially the 2010 interior and the new engines, I was sold. Even talked myself out of the SC unit since the 375HP standard Jaguar based engine is fabulous. What an amazing vehicle, 500 miles to date and since reliability is always a question for these vehicles I should report that mine is perfect so far. Please be as reliable as my BMW/Mercedes and you will be king."

No air conditioning, no Navigation no radio and has spent 20 plus days in the shop in less then 5000 miles. The windows don't always close and it may not find the ""smart key for 30 minutes which means it wont start until it does but the alarm is sounding for the duration. We know any drive is our last but if we don't get killed by the police because they think we are stealing it, some bad people will kill us while we wait for the ""smart key"" the alerts them easy prey.

It is a joy to own and drive. It turns heads everywhere I go. I have not seen a lot of it on the road yet. After taking a 500 mile trip, I did not experience any body aches or soreness. I just wanted to keep driving for the sheer joy of driving this automobile. I have not experienced any of these difficulties that some of the reviewers have described. Mine is a stornoway gray with almond interior and luxury package. The sound system is great. Actually better than the Bose I have had in my other luxury SUV.

2. The new standard 375hp V-8 is super smooth and faster from 0-60 than all 17 cars I have owned minus a 911 and a Mini Cooper S. The sport mode is really not necessary, but if you want to beat 29 of 30 cars off the line, sport mode is available to you.
3. The nav is noy super hig tech, but it works well and the is easy to use once you unlearn your old nav system.

I come from Toyota diesel Prado, then Volkswagen Touareg diesel, then BMW x6 diesel and after that the LR SS. 
Changed the BMW into a LR because the X6 is to low for the sandy roads here in Samana.

Bought LR new in sept 2010, model 2011. Changed tires from 40-45 for the roads here as well.

Very comfortable car in al ways. Always and very suffucient power.

This is the first Range Rover we purchased and I cannot find any other SUV on the market that I would rather own.  This car has been pristine and we have had absolutely no issues other than minor items that are easily repairable.  I love the fact you only have to take it to the dealer once a year for service and that is it!  It is a dream to drive and is versatile enough for a fancy date night, trip to the beach, or lugging kids around town.  I downsized from a larger SUV and wondered if I would miss the extra room but what I ended up NOT missing was having to park a huge SUV in tiny spaces!  I would highly recommend this vehicle.

This is bar none the most fun to drive SUV with a build quality that can not be matched.  With the 5 liter engine @ 375 hp definitely has enough power when you need it, the exhaust note sounds great when just at cruising speeds.

I am pleasantly surprised so far, however, I have only owned it for one month.  I like the ride and overall feeling, plus the 375 hp gives it some pep when you hit the gas, which has been reassuring.  I like the overall look and my kids seem to enjoy climbing in and out of it.

Maybe on the 2K mile odometer reading the car flashed a parking brake fault when I was driving it on the freeway that prompted me to find the nearest spot to stop.

We looked at the Cayenne, X5, & Q7 and though all of these had great attributes the RRS took the cake. We wanted something that was going to give us the luxury of the Cayenne with the build and reliability of the X5 & Q7. The RRS has everything that you could ask for we opted for the HSE LUX which provided just what we needed not going into the Supercharged. That was too much for the wife and with owning an M3 we didnt need that for our family.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2014,senator1971, 01/29/2014,Great Leap Forward...,4,"I collected the car in a blizzard 2 weeks ago.
Since then, I've only done a couple of hundred miles including a 100 mile round trip yesterday. Car is light years ahead of the previous model.
I was a little skeptical of buying the V6 due to the power drop over the normally aspirated V8 of the previous RRS, but the car feels much stronger than the figures portray and I don't regret not getting the V8. 

Design and finish are way ahead of last gen, as is the ride quality on standard 20"" wheels.
Capability in the snow and ice has been excellent as well.
Interior space, particularly in the back, is way up on the previous model."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2014,expatbrit, 10/21/2014,Unbeatable at almost any price,5,"The Range Rover Sport is not cheap; with the V8 engine and top-end Meridian audio, mine was all but $100k on the road. But you get what you pay for - stunning performance, great handling, the best driving position of any car I've owned, and a luxurious ride that can go anywhere ... and I'm getting 18 mpg in stop-start motoring. After 3 years this all remains true and there have been zero faults with the vehicle. After 6 years, I am just as satisfied as when it was new. No unexpected maintenance and still the best vehicle I've ever owned

Literally 5/5 in all categories with the exception of the infotainment system.

Fortunately I predominantly use my iPhone for music/GPS so it's not a huge problem for me.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2014,K-rags, 05/25/2019,Initial impressions,4,"Just picked up a used RR Sport 2014 Autobiography dark gray with red pimento interior.  Pretty easy to drive, plenty of power to spare, nice exhaust note.  The infotainment unit is a bit laggy.  Nice soft touch materials inside.  Seems like it will be thirsty at the fuel pump, but then again this may be the last of the big V8s before everything becomes electrified.  Got an extended warranty plan just in case, but hope to have fun with this one.  "
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2014,JR, 06/23/2018,Beats my Cayenne,5,"I was reluctant as others to go with RR after the years of horror stories.  I was in love with my Porsche Cayenne until electrical problems began after a water leak.  When finally they threw their hands in the air and couldn't get to the bottom of all the shorts that the leak caused we were reluctant to go into another Cayenne.   I set out researching the RR Sport as the looks has always had me captivated since 2002 or so.   This body style is sleek as heck and rivals any X5 I come across.  I have no regrets on our decision to go with the RR.  We went with the V6 and don't miss the V8 we had in the Cayenne at all especially with the nice increase in MPG comparably.   This car in fit and finish surpasses any M class I have owned and we still have our daughter in one, as well as our Porsche!   Total class and sporty looks at the same time.   We have not had ANY issues with the car other than a simple thing like the plastic cover of the keys coming loose, THAT IS IT!    Way to go Land Rover on your redesign of the RR sport............you hit the ball out of the park!

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2014,RRS2TSLA, 09/09/2016,RRS Supercharged Dynamic is a lot of hype,2,"I like cars. I've owned some nice ones. I'm particularly fond of Rover since my grandfather owned the British Leland franchise in Victoria, Australia. But I've completely divorced myself of Land Rover after two very unfortunate experiences with an LR4 and a Range Rover Sport V8 Supercharged Dynamic. Here's my summary of main issues with the RRS; I Won't even start with my LR4 needing a new fuel injection system and transmission at 54K miles: The RRS is FAST!!! Like scary fast. And I don't mean that in a good way because the car is scary to drive fast. Edmunds track tested my vehicle at 4.2 seconds 0-60. But what good is a car that can't break quickly, feels like it's ripping itself apart, and can't handle around mild corners while accelerating or going fast. When accelerating in mine, it felt amazing, but I never felt confident that I could turn, swerve or break quickly if needed. So anxiety ensued with most of my opportunities to accelerate during daily driving. Second, the car's build quality is horrible for the price point. My vehicle rattled at the glove box, at the center console, in the driver and passenger seats, at the A pillar of the driver door, in the ceiling somewhere, and worst of all it rattled badly if I turned up the premium stereo. If you like luxury, you'll love how the RRS looks. But take it for a 10 minute drive and you'll be bothered that your nephews Toyota Carolla is quieter and doesn't rattle. Third issues was the breaks squeaked the day I bought the car and through a set of break pads (my wife's LR4 did the same through 3 sets of pads). Near $100K for a vehicle that sounds embarrassing pulling up at a stoplight. Not cool with me. Fourth and maybe most important, the myriad of issues I had with the car were well overshadowed by the HORRIBLE service experience at Land Rover Seattle. I could call about issues and they'd sometimes never follow up. I would complain about issues at multiple meetings and be promised follow up only to have nobody contact me. To be fair, the staff was pleasant. But when I purchase a $70K and a $95K+ vehicle from the same dealership I expect exceptional loyalty and customer service in return and that most certainly did not happen. In the end, I sold both my Rovers in the same month and took a massive loss on the RRS. Then I bought a Model S Tesla. And that car... well let's just say every issue I've pointed out is no longer and issue and I'll never own another vehicle but a Tesla.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2014,joe493, 08/10/2014,After the initial love affair is over she'll bleed you to death,3,"The Range Rover sport is in my view an over priced V6 powered ego trip.
The poorly designed interior layout coupled with the least intuitive gps and entertainment system out there should give anyone pause. And why does the gps system point upward into to the sun?
The small screen is hard enough to deal with, let alone the excessive sun light!
Additionally you'll find that although Land Rover claims there SUV as being the best off road vehicles in the world, it's interesting why there tires only offer about 3/16 to 1/4"" clearance for the rim.
The best drivers will still curb the rims.

Handling and acceleration are excellent.  Handles at least as good as my previous five series and is considerably faster. Interior materials are top notch. so far my opinion is the electronics leave a bit to be desired for a vehicle in this price range. Meridian upgrade is pretty nice. I have not use the vehicle enough to determine whether navigation and other Bluetooth and iPod controls are good or bad but I will post a follow up after some time of ownership.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2015,Sydney Klein, 10/28/2017,Well worth my money.,5,"I bought my 2015 RRS Supercharged after having so many issues with my 03' Range Rover. I was a little hesitant buying another RR after my nightmare 03' I had for so long. I bought the warranty (well worth it) to help out if anything went wrong. This SUV is an absolute beast! As you can see, I have the 5.0 Supercharged V8. The acceleration puts a smile on my face every time is step on the gas pedal. I sometimes have my son's friends in the car and they beg me to step on it for the feeling you get in your stomach. It's absolutely crazy! The seats are very comfortable and the heated/cooled seats are amazing. My two main complaints with this car is the navigation system and the brake dive. Navigation has almost got me fired from my job on multiple occasions (I'm a sales executive for Hilton and work all over Los Angeles and San Diego). It constantly is leading me to dead ends and the wrong locations. The brake dive can just be horrible too. The car lurches, almost unsafely, forward when you slam the brake pedal down. I thought I was going to flip at one point. Those are my only two complaints about my car. I cannot complain about gas mileage as it's a supercharged 5.0 litre V8, and I have a lead foot, haha. I get compliments on it everywhere I go and it's truly cool to have that when you're just casually just filling up on gas. I love my car and do not regret buying it.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2015,Jerry Thompson, 10/04/2020,Exceeded expectations!,5,"When it comes to vehicles, especially buying a new/used one, everyone and their cousin seems to have an opinion. Especially, if you mention the title “Range Rover.” Let me tell you this, if you want something then go get it, or do whatever it takes to make it happen! Also, so your homework. Decided on. Range Rover Sport Supercharged. Never realized it was a vehicle I’d actually be able to afford, even slightly used with low mileage. Furthermore, the BS rumors that Land Rover is garbage and maintenance is astronomical. Do your homework. Research the vehicle and study the market. You’ll find out that most of what you’ve heard is #fakenews. Love my ‘15 RRS Supercharged! It’s super fast, handles like a Porsche, yet is as smooth as an Escalade and has every feature you’d expect out of a $96k MSRP luxury vehicle. Only complaint is the so-called 1200 Watt, 19-speaker Meridian sound system. One speaker is blown and it’s turned into a research program figuring out how to either upgrade the stock midrange speakers or replace OEM.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2016,Flaviu Budean, 12/04/2015,Loving my 2016 Range Rover Sport Td6 (Diesel),5,"What a ride... Ordered my 2016 and was delivered in October. I totally love the truck. The efficiency of diesel engine is amazing. I get 26-27 mpg combined. This kind of milage per gallon is the reason why most SUV should be diesel. I do not even use the smart on/off technology because I believe that diesel engines should have a minimum of ON/OFF for engine. Truly for a person to be fully satisfied with this RRS, they have to get all upgrades possible. Audio is garbage for the money you pay if you do not upgrade to the Meridian system. But this is a small sacrifice that is made up by the way it drives even if you are like me, bough the car without upgrading to Meridian System.
Overall I could not picked a better SUV. Very happy with it and my friends and family love it too, so now there will be other RRS purchases in family :)

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2016,Hugo Chavez, 09/26/2016,Overall good first impression,4,"If top of the line electronic interface and logic controls are important to you, look somewhere else. The car ride and comfort are great. The diesel engine has great torque and passing power making general driving for an SUV of this size enjoyable. The cabin has premium materials and the seats are comfortable. The stock sound system is cheap and only good to listen to the news reports and football games (which is what I need it for). If you are an audiophile you should upgrade to the max. The touch screen is at least 2 generations behind and the interface is clunky and poorly designed. I generally navigate using Google Maps and will continue to do so. Land Rover should promptly update this shameful interface.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2016,Bagman, 12/21/2016,Luxury economy suv,4,"The rrs diesel so far is very enjoyable to drive. Very comfortable ride and seating is also comfortable. The fuel mileage and range with the diesel is terrific with good acceleration and torque. My biggest complaint with the car is the primitive electronics! For an $ 80,000 care Land Rover should be ashamed of the infotainment system. If you went to a Honda CR-V or Ford Escape for 1/3 of the price you would have much, much better systems.

I still love the fuel mileage that the diesel give me. The ride, handling,  and comfort are excellent. Cost of service visit is ridiculously high!  The nav/entertainment system is inferior to almost any vechicle on the market. I think that it may have been updated for 2017.
"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2016,John Harrison, 03/14/2016,My new Range Rover Sport,4,"Great car, overall. It really is. Although, there are a few issues that you must contend with before entering into a lease/purchase. I have had an Audi before and I felt its infotainment system was bad. Well, nothing quite prepares you for the system in the current Land Rover/Jaguar range. It is quite simply, the worst I have ever encountered. So bad that the dealership were open about it and didn't even bother to go through it. The in-control offers new potential, but the screen resolution is dire and the traffic overlay in the GPS is simply laughable. I knew more about upcoming apps than the dealership did, and they are still woeful. Why Land Rover decided to do it alone is beyond me. They should have teamed up with apple or android for their far superior app service. I simply use my own maps for long distance driving, which is  a bit of an annoyance since I put out 75k for a car, who's entertainment system is worse than a 2011 Jetta (another car I owned).

The app store is a joke, they have nothing in there that people actually use. All the fanfare about an app that allows you to conference call in the car...really? Despite the fact that LR have put a ton of money into a new research facility in Oregon, it couldn't come soon enough. justDrive is a better alternative to using your phone, but it saps data and is clunky. It tires to filter all your functions into one easy application, but fails in poor quality graphics, and bad overlay. It also requires continuous cell coverage, which can be problematic when heading into the tundra. Sadly its inhouse sat nav is just not up to snuff, and has been around for years, but its stubbornly holding on. Last gripe on the tech front, is the screen size, camera quality and safety features. The guys at Land Rover should hire whoever designed the new Volvo XC90. That is what I call a car of the future. Amazing camera quality, and infotainment system. Why my car doesn't have a hotspot connection is beyond me. Most do these days, and its not exactly cutting edge technology. As for the sound system, I also opted for the base, which is piss poor. You have to turn the sound up really high to actually hear it, and there is no bass to speak of. I had the base sound system in the Audi and it was amazing. 

Onto comfort, it did take a while to break in the seats, but they are lovely now. It is hard to find a comfortable position for my arms, especially when driving longer distances. The door frame is eventually to high, and the door ledge is always to low. They should do away with the arm rest, its tiny, and is just an irritant. I always put it up and don't think I have ever bothered to use it since I got the car. The center bin, although large, is not easy to access, its so deep things get jumbled around. There is no space to put glasses, cell phones and cups in the center console. Space really is a premium up front. 

Now the first world gripes are out the way, the car is fantastic off the line. No real lag, and you pop it into sport mode if you need a quick entrance into traffic on the freeway, and it just goes like the clap. Worth every penny, and infotainment let down at that point. I have used it for some winter driving, and its 4x4 system is great. I couldn't have felt safer in this car. It just reads every inch of the road. No joke, its constantly adjusting to the conditions, and I was able to blaze past people doing 15 mph when the snow hit. Yes the ride is a little stiff, and you feel every bump, but I think that puts me more onto the road. A great feeling. It is well insulated and easy to reach the important buttons, climate and radio. 

Now, for reliability, It has been in a few times, but that was down to me thinking it was broken, rather than it actually was. Some concerning issues that Land Rover should fix is the hill roll. Most if not all cars stop the car rolling back on a steep
 incline. At a stop light or whatever. Not the Range, it slowly releases every 5 seconds. I took it in, and I was told that is how the car works, but ever since it has gone in, it doesn't release on an incline. Very strange. The other issue is with the cruise control. While you can set it, it is slow to adjust and you can get stuck trying to slow down. Best thing to do is to cancel the program and reset it at a slower speed. It is dangerous in its current set up. When going down a hill, on a normal highway I have noticed that the truck speeds up and never holds at a constant. The Audi never did that, and always held the car at the chosen speed. Again, I was told that it is like that and now it seems to have gone away when they had their top tech take a look. 

Since I have not had a full service, it would be unfair to talk about the price, or issues. I would note that for a car this price, there are a few things lacking. And some areas of real improvement. I would consider a new one in 2 years but I some serious improvements would have to be made for that to happen, from sales to service

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2016,BostonRRS99, 02/14/2017,5 months and 5k miles (Updated 17k miles),4,"So Edmunds was nice enough to send me an email asking for an update on my 16' RRS and I thought, why not? I actually traded the RRS in after 14 months and 17k miles. Overall, I loved the RRS. Incredible performance, handled great, gas milage was 21, seating was great/comfortable, Meridian sound was spectacular and generally speaking, a joy to drive in all types of weather. On longer road trips the RRS was very comfortable. I have a son in college 500 miles away (round trip) who played football, so 10 times (over 2 fall seasons) we did the trip - best ride and the RRS loved to settle in at about 78mph; quiet as a church mouse and stuck to the road like a bad reputation. The only issue I had was squeaky brakes (yes, you read that right); the high pitched everyone looks at you type. After 4 trips to the dealer, they finally got an ""upgraded"" set of pads (at 14k miles) from the motherland that didn't squeak. This was incredibly frustrating experience as RR knows or knew they had this issue, yet made me go through the steps and time for what should have been resolved the first time. My only other gripes (one which was changed for 17's on) was the small infotainment screen and the lack of storage. I can't believe a vehicle of this size has such limited storage up front and the hatch was rather small (my wife's ML350 has more space in the back). The short version of the review - if you want an SUV that handles like a Porsche 911 (well almost), feels incredibly safe/comfortable, accelerates like a rocket ship yet can go anywhere in any weather - get a RRS. Oh and I traded mine in for a GMC Sierra Ultimate Denali - just needed something more capable at hauling stuff (see storage gripe) around yet was great on road trips.

We are essentially looking at maintenance cost that would be triple of what was advertised. This car is a money pit, buyers beware!

I ordered my 2016 Range Rover Sports SE and did not upgrade the audio system because I did not think the standard radio will be that bad.  I am not an audiophile and I listen mainly to the Enya station on Pandora, classical's and Jazz.  My vehicle was delivered to me last week.  What a shock!!!  My Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge produces a better bass sound quality that the piece of worthless stuff they put in the vehicle and called speakers.  The enjoyability of a ride is always complimented by the ride's audio system.  This is such a disappointment!!!  All the false buzz about the meridian speakers sound on the range rover is plain total baloney.  I am so disappointed and I am now thinking of selling the car.
Also, the entire incontrol app is total nonsense.  There is no usable app amongst the 6 or 7 apps thereon.
The horrible audio and incontrol app system aside, the car drives well.  Its a Range Rover!

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2017,Garp, 08/29/2017,My best car yet,5,"After ordering my Autobiography, I waited a long 5 months (ridiculous) until collection day. After having finally received the vehicle, I can say I am truly impressed with the quality, ride, performance and design. Literally my only two minor complaints are that the rear seats are rock hard and after doing a six hour road trip, my back hurt compliments of the front seat. I never had that problem on my 2008 BMW X5. Perhaps the seats will break in over time. The second complaint was that I had to pay $650 to get a black Morzine fabric headliner. You get the same headliner in beige for free. After paying $108,000 for this vehicle, the headliner should have been Alcantara at the very least and preferably leather as on the big Range Rover Autobiography. That kind of short sighted decision by Land Rover to save a few bucks makes you feel a little cheated. You might want to reconsider that one Land Rover.   But in the end, I love everything else about this vehicle and it is truly the best vehicle I've ever owned. It looks fast standing still and people are awed at the perceived and real high-end quality that this vehicle exudes. I never thought I would love the Driving Experience of another vehicle more than my BMW X5. The Range Rover Sport is that vehicle for me. I was a little concerned about what I've heard about supposed reliability issues but I sprung for 3 extra years of the Land Rover extended warranty, and I felt that warranty was a good value.  So I feel confident that my experience with this Range Rover Sport will be a good one over the next seven years. I highly recommend this car.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2017,Kenyan Strong, 01/05/2019,Best Truck and Land Rover ever owned!,5,"We bought HSE with their expensive silver paint( called halcyon I think? Ridiculous cost $1650 or something? and black matte powdercoat beautiful rims trading in LR4 and really happy and impressed most with RR 6 cylinder diesel.  Our friend at a Ct dealer paid me what I paid  LR4 2016 so they must have wanted my safari rigged LR4? Our beautifu HSE l RR sport is now over year old with 11000 miles and flawless with great fuel economy. HSE is way to go with 20 inch rims and sunroof that opens.  Favorite Features- BLindspot syste., parking package sensors , diesel engine torque/ efficiency, and above all else HEATED AND COOLED SEATS THAT ARE VENTILATED in beautiful British stitched leather. That is huge and cannot believe I ever lived without this now looking back as I am 47 now. We like the simplicity of the touch pro system and  no non sense interior which in simply elegant.  Everything works when needed , smartphone integration seamless, and we are simple people with children and love all the safety features you dont even notice working for you until you need them.  Brakes and transmission best in  class.  Fit and finish top notch and this is our go to vehicle for family travel and taking the bikes,skiis, or boat on vacation or bags to airport.  Trailer hitch was installed by me aftermarket and easy to do yourself as truck has simple quick connect for wiring and saved a ""boatload"" of cash getting factory done.  Brilliant towing vehicle with diesel  for long trips and etrailer is great support if you use for hauling trailer with it.
We bought HSE off lot with makeover coming in 18 with every solid option minus Meridan upgrade because we use our phones and music sounds great  streaming on stock speakers.  I also saw this was rated top 10 for holding  resale value recently  as well for this model even though we never plan to sell.  Very popular here in CT.  Dealer gave us 4 year maintenance plan too free after bought car  which really makes this cheap to own and confident. The dealer /service network has been excellent no matter where we go.  Efficiency wise, wife and I are averaging 32 mpg to date since we picked up overall which Is amazing considering the size and heft of this  truck  as well as the fact we tow 5000+- lbs alot.  Highly recommend to own if you can trade up as RR lease awful and waste of money. This is certainly not the range rover of old we all think of.  I am tough customer to please and quality assurance much better under Tata and exceeds expectations. The truck is also a beast in bad northeast weather  and to take to the mountains.  We paid cash as upgrade and plan to keep this forever well maintained for children and stored in garage daily.  I dare to tell people here the truck is good value for all we get from it if you go in with right mindset and can afford it. Would buy again and my wife and I are both Jaguar Land Rover buyer /customers for life and passionate about the brand.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2017,Rover Realist, 03/21/2019,Fit For Anything But Mars,5,"This is a vehicle that is so much more than the sum of its parts.  A Range Rover Sport is amazingly comfortable on the highway, has handling almost as good as a Cayenne and is the best off-road vehicle money can buy.  Comfort, handling and off-road prowess all require very different mechanical elements and design,.  Therefore, the Range Rover Sport is an engineering miracle.  Add the British styled luxurious interior which is much more than even the best teutonic designs from Audi, and there is nothing that competes with the completeness of a Range Rover.  The only con is fuel consumption and the solution is the diesel variant.  Not only can you get 33 MPG on the highway the diesel has so much torque it is just as fast as the V8 Supercharged version when going from 0-40 MPH.  Since this is the speed range the vast majority of drivers drive in, the diesel option makes all the sense in the world.  If you want a car that no matter the weather or the road you are taking will get you safely and comfortably to your destination, this is it.  Every time I get in my Range Rover Sport it feels like the car is giving me a big hug.  As for reliability, there has not been a single issue.

The so called apps they have suck.   None of the navigational apps they have work for me, despite spending hours trying to learn them.  They simply don't work.  If I had known the programmers put this car on the market without a good navigation voice assist software, I would never have bought it.  Check this out before you buy, make them show you it works (which it doesn't).  They keep saying they will have an update to the software soon, but so far zap.

I purchase the extended warranty to cover my concern over repairs but so far it has more electronics than I can fathom so I had to read the owners manual. This car is Chic, Gorgeous and has an incredible ride"
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2017,Chris, 02/02/2020,Solid,4,"Stately, elegant, and cushy. The HSE is a trifle underpowered, but a great cruiser. Ultra comfortable and full of great features, this car has been hassle free for three years and 22k miles thus far, with the exception of quickly worn brake pads. Looking forward to driving this into the ground for the next 7 years... Range Rovers always have a timeless, classic quality unlike any other vehicle.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,Pat Q, 08/12/2018,Looks Great But Doesn’t Work Great,2,"I custom ordered a 2018 Range Rover Sport Supercharged Dynamic V8 in February 2018 and took delivery in late May of 2018. The vehicle looks awesome both inside and out. I test drove the V6 which was pretty unimpressive so I got the V8. Tons of power, fast and the exhaust sounds great. Now for the negatives. Nothing but problems with the electronics and infotainment system. Back-up camera did not work consistently. Visibility when backing up is limited using the mirrors so the camera is pretty much a necessity. It’s very nerve racking backing this thing up when the rear camera doesn’t work. One night the vehicle just would not start for about 20 minutes. A couple of times the Air Conditioner randomly decided to turn itself off. 3G WiFi frequently doesn’t turn on after starting the vehicle. I complained to the dealer and they had me bring it in for repair. They did a software update to the system to address the problems. After the update the back-up camera works most of the time - but still occasionally won’t turn on when I put the vehicle in reverse. After the update some new problems appeared that were not present prior to the update. The interior ambient lighting resets to the highest setting after the ignition is turned off - and sometimes the vehicle will randomly change my color selection to the white light setting. Radio presets on the lower touchscreen also developed a problem where they would appear for about a second and then disappear before I can use them. Other one off random glitches occur every couple of days. I contacted the dealer regarding the new problems and I was told there is currently no fix for them. Some sort of corrupt software problem that they are trying to sort out. The dealer put me on a list with other people having problems and will call when a new software update is available. Everyday is a new adventure in problems and glitches with the electronics. Do a quick search on the internet for 2018 Range Rover Sport Problems and it won’t take you long to see what I am talking about. It’s unbelievable that any brand new car could be sold with so many defects, let alone one in this price range. If I knew then what I know now, I would have bought another Mercedes or BMW. So bottom line, if you really want the vehicle doe to it’s awesome looks and performance, just be prepared to live with some glitchy electronics problems that Land Rover doesn’t know how to fix."
land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,Rico Magsipoc, 09/25/2018,Look Elsewhere to Spend Your $100k,3,"Bought a brand new Range Rover Sport V8 Supercharged.  While test driving the vehicle, BEFORE purchase, the center console went out.  I should have taken that as a sign how problematic this vehicle was.  Went ahead with the purchase.  Now, every 2 days, the center console goes out.  To correct it, I have to park the car, shut the engine completely off, and restart the car.  The center console is where you control the climate as well as the vehicle's driving characteristics (Eco, Dynamic, 4x4, etc.).  When it's out, you cannot control any of these features!  I went back to the dealer for a software update but that didn't fix the issue.  Now, a new problem has come up where the car no longer detects the keyfob.  You can imagine how nerve wracking it was when this issue came up as I wasn't sure if the vehicle would start if I shut the engine off to correct the problem!  I am taking it back to the dealer this week and will be provided a loaner.  No commitments from the dealer when the issue will be fixed.  This is a 2-week old, brand new $100k car.  Take your hard-earned money elsewhere.

Update:  10/03/18
Another trip to the dealer. Another software update. Same issue. As I drove home after picking up the vehicle from the Service dept, center console goes out again.  In the 3 weeks since I purchased this vehicle, I’ve driven it 2 weeks and it’s spent 1 week at the dealership for repairs.  No less than 4 trips back for Service due to center console and keyfob not working.

Update:  10/10/18
The vehicle has been with the dealership now about 5 days, since dropping it off 10/05.  The update is their technicians are working on identifying the problem.  Note that when I dropped the car off on 10/05, there were two other customers, one with a new Velar and another with a new Range Rover Sport having the very same center console issue.  This is a widespread problem.  Buyer beware.

Update:  04/10/19
After numerous trips to the dealership and multiple software updates, Land Rover finally swapped out the center console.  I am glad to say that the problem has gone away!  While their service is fantastic every time I went into the dealership, I am extremely disappointed that they didn't arrive at the solution faster.  In my first 3 months of ownership of this *brand new* $100k vehicle, it spent more time in the shop getting diagnosed for this widely-known problem (please do look up the center console issue online).  It has completely left a bad taste in my mouth.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that issues with the vehicle will be far in between.  Time will tell.

Update:  10/11/20
After the center console swap, happy to report that I haven't had any issues with my RRS.  Drives like a dream.  Loving how the supercharged engine growls when I give its some gas.  Updated my review from a 2-star to a 3-star.  Here's to hoping for long term satisfaction on this car!

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,Chris Cook, 08/15/2018,"Drives Fantastic, Technology Awful",3,"The Range Rover Sport is looks great, drives great, but the new technology is awful! I specifically waited for the 2019 model with the new touchscreen technology throughout, and this vehicle was delivered in May of 2018. It is clear that this tech had not been thoroughly tested. It is slow and VERY buggy. Some screens take a long time to come up and other times the screens are completely blank. I sent to dealer to update to the lasted version, and not much has changed since that update. My prior vehicle was a Tesla, which occasionally had to reboot, but otherwise worked seamlessly. The interior technology and the accompanying mobile apps are so bad, that it almost outweighs how great this car drives.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,Suckered customer, 09/03/2018,Junk Rover 2018 Range Rover sport,1,"Received order mid May 2018.  Had electronics issues day one.  Within first 24 hours parts started to fall off the vehicle.  Engine issues with warning lights started within a few days of receiving the vehicle. Had 19 return trips for ongoing issues. Trailer package never worked. Park assist never worked. Camera system failed while at the dealer. Touchscreen would not accept touch input.  Cruise control had total failure on the interstate with engine shut down. Engine failed on return trip to dealer.  In 4 months of ownership the dealer had the vehicle for over 3 months.  The engine and cabin were repeatedly torn apart to change out parts and boxes.  Land Rover engineers repeatedly played with software so one time the vehicle was not in English.  All the increasing electronic issues resulted in the dash being torn apart so many times that you could not open the glove compartment.  Filled “lemon law” under state statutes and finally Land Rover USA had to refund my money.  My parting comment is that the vehicle looks great but in my experience it is JUNK.  I personally would avoid Land Rover products.  I had to wait 5 months from time of ordering to receive my junk.  I ordered all the options in the Diesel engine and option packages all for one month of intermittent possession and 3 months at the dealer before got a refund.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,Kevin Pishkar, 09/15/2018,"My terrible, no good very bad experience",1,"I would like to describe my experience with my ""2018 Range Rover supercharge"" that I special ordered from this dealership (Land Rover Houston, North). I finally got the car in March after much delay. Since then the car has been in the shop total of 6 times. Yes 6 times!! By the way this is my 6th Rover and I know the brand well. But there is definitely something wrong with this year model. As they have described it like this: ""there is a ghost in this car""! The car has been at the dealer total of 2 months while they put me in one of their fancy Discovery loaners. Meanwhile I have made multiple car payments. Range Rover (Land Rover Houston, North) puts 50 miles on my car each way. They have driven my new car more than I have! The service department (Land Rover Houston, North) has been cooperative (Jason Baisden - Service Manager) but the issues have continued to happen. We discussed a ""buy-back"" option but the area Land Rover USA representative has refused and is now asking me to bring the car back AGAIN for another software update coming out soon. This is a disaster for the brand which I have defended for years. I strongly suggest to take your $129,000 and buy something else. It is a shame that Range Rover (Land Rover Houston, North) has decided to continue to keep me in this car which is a bundle of electronic disaster. NEVER again I would deal with this product or this dealership (Land Rover Houston, North) if they refuse to buy this car back. Gorgeous car with bunch of bugs!! They are about to open another Dealership in West Houston and I will make sure we pass the word to all friends to avoid the car!! My next step is a legal action and applying the Texas Lemon Law to my car. This manufacturer has failed to deliver a promise you make to the customer when selling a car. This car is a driving hazard!!

Update!
The dealer agreed to buy my car back and I ordered me a 2019 version of the same car which arrived December of 2018. As of this writing in March the new car has only been in the shop once due to factory recall which they took care of it in one day. This car is my 8th RR and am very happy with it. Can't wait to see the next one.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,San Antonio, TX,Do your homework before buying or leasing,3,"I bought a 2018 Range Rover Sport several months ago.  24 hours after my purchase while on a family trip, I started experiencing software issues.  The infotainment system has been a consistent issue.  The answer was to do a software update at the dealership once I returned.  The local dealership has been very nice and supportive applying these updates now monthly, but now we have given up.  Since these updates would correct the problem for about 24 hours, it was not worth the time or effort.    It is a product issue.

My issues are now daily and extremely frustrating.    The dealership helped me as much as they could and had to refer me to their Customer Support folks out of NJ.   I hope you NEVER have to interact with the team out of NJ.   The Range Rover team out of NJ are the worst support team that I have ever experienced.  My assigned representative denied further assisting me and basically stated by email that I need to wait for a new update to resolve my issue.  There is no ETA on this issue being resolved.  No call back to discuss this over the phone.  I had multiple emails and calls into my rep. trying to further discuss my issues.    I reached another representative, then no return call for additional assistance.  Again, calling and finally reaching someone who escalated my case with a promise of a return call within 5 hours.  Well, again no return call.  Calling again, I reached someone who did help me and a person who did call me back.  Basically, they are review my case and it will take at least 30 days.  So, I continue paying for a luxury car that is not working as advertised and share negative press.

I work full time, have a family and don't have time for these issues.  

I have been very patient and nice, but extremely frustrated and now sharing this experience with other's PRIOR to their purchase or support other's out there with the same situation.

This is a widespread issue.  Buyers beware. (I bought my car the middle of August 2018 - it is now the middle of January 2019.  Still no resolution!

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,SrS, 10/19/2018,Second Vehicle seems to work,3,"I purchased a 2018 Range Rover Sport Supercharged Dynamic for my wife.  It's an expensive SUV at over $100k.  We've had Mercedes, BMW, etc... in the past.  We got our vehicle the end of February 2018 and it had technology issues from the beginning.  Back-up camera was a consistent issue as well as other software related glitches.  The car always started and ran great but the technology/software issues were a nightmare.  I tried to get the car replaced but was told no by Land Rover USA so the car was at the dealer at least 8 times for software updates ect…  I got the name of a Lemon Law attorney from counsel for my company and shared with my dealer that if the next software update didn't fix it I was calling the Lemon Law firm. They knew the name and we just got our new vehicle.  The new one seems to be functioning as it should with the issues we were dealing with on the first one apparently resolved.  One nice thing is the new once had about $2500 of additional options that we got for free with the exchange.  Also the warranty and any packages purchased (wheel/tire protection, prepaid maintenance etc..) start new from the new delivery date so it's like you just purchased a new vehicle.  The first months were a pain in the $*% but now that we have one that functions as it should we're happy with the vehicle and love the power of the supercharged V8 and other Range Rover touches in and out of the vehicle.  Just make sure you get one that was manufactured after July of 2018.  Good Luck!

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2018,Peter S, 01/23/2019,Poor software ruining my experience,2,"This is my third RR Sport and the one with the most problems. Within days of leaving the dealership there with issues with the infotainment center - cameras not working, radio, phone, ambient lighting all intermittently failing. The dealership said this was the first time they had seen this happen - based on other reviews this must not be true - but the blame was put on my iphone. The car software was updated from v2 to v4 - again not sure why the sell a new 2019 model with old software - which has fixed some of the issues but gremlins still creep in without warning with the system shutting down randomly. To me not being able to use my phone hands free could be a safety issue as is not having the backup camera functioning when needed. I'm also worried about the reliability of the features like adaptive cruise control. The dealership did tell me all new products like computers or software go through a phase like this and should be expected. My computer didn't cost $83,000 so my expectations are much higher and this seems to be a problem that isn't new. I would avoid the RR Sport until they sort these issues out.

No parts in the US but yet car is sold here. Third visit to the shop was for a regular service call but when i thought car was ready, the engine light was lit. Another few days passed before I was able to take it home. Fourth visit, a water leak inside vehicle (driver’s side and seat behind driver) drenched in water and also a service was due. .

Unfortunately, there is no words to describe how unhappy and disappointed I am to own this EXPENSIVE JUNK of a car. I know I will not be keeping this miserable car for very long.

The exterior is stunning. The interior and infotainment is the biggest upgrade to me. Yes, the new touch pro duo isn’t perfect. But to me, it’s one of the best in class. My issues are minor. An occasional glitch on the screen or a lost connection with my iPod touch. Most of this will be resolved with the latest software update. Which will also add Apple car play!

I went with the V6 HSE Dynamic this time. I thought I would really miss the V8. Surprisingly, there is not much difference out on the road. Especially in Dynamic mode. I do want the growl from the exhaust. So next time, I will break down and get the V8.

As with any luxury car, you get what you pay for. Parts are expensive as the car ages. But you should know and expect this. 

For the cars I considered (Audi Q7, BMW X5 or X6, Porsche Macaan), this one checked all the boxes for what I wanted.

injured or killed. Our vehicle was going 40mph when we lost complete power. We were able to turn into a commercial  shopping area - that’s called pure luck! Owners be aware this is a problem LandRover America is struggling with. They need to immediately Recall the 2018’s & 19’s models. I requested after we brought the car into Service & had the vehicle repaired according to the manufacturer instructions, LandRover issue a  guarantee that they solved this throttle problem- they Refused! Even though we could have died because of loss of power LandRover placed the issue with the Dealer. The Dealer fixed the vehicle according to Manufacturers instructions & it’s the Dealer according to LandRover that holds the liability. This is nonsensical. Just like Audi who had a sudden acceleration problem years ago, LandRover better take notice that they Hold the Liability-they are the responsible party for this defect.

This has been the biggest vehicular disappointment of my life. The car has been in the shop over and over and over. The majority of the issues center around the infotainment system and electrical issue. The car has stopped recognizing the key. Interior lights come on out of the blue. The bluetooth connection is very faulty and will often freeze. You can not simply plug a phone in via USB to charge without it disconnecting the bluetooth. The control touch screens have burned out. Computer controls via the steering wheel have tons of glitches E.g, up goes down, right goes left etc. The reverse camera intermittently fails to come up on the screen. The tires lose pressure. It is routinely low on coolant.  We also had a total loss of power steering, rendering it un-drivable within the first 10 days of owning the vehicle. If you are considering buying a Range Rover.

Within months of owning the vehicle this car stopped without any warning in the middle of a five lane highway.  The car completely locked up.  I couldn’t even shift the gears.  Cars were speeding up on us and my daughter was screaming from the back. I called 911, but it took the police a half hour to arrive because of the holiday traffic.  Once they arrived, it took two tow trucks over two hours to figure out how to unlock the wheels to put it up on the bed. I filed a claim with corporate.  The advisor James Rochester said they would review the case and get back with me within 30 days.  Almost 60 days later he sends me a letter stating that they were sorry about the inconvenience, but because they fixed it they are denying my claim.  It took them two weeks to fix the engine failure and they added 50 miles to the car to make sure it was ok.  My car has a warranty and The added mileage was on me.  He stated it would have to be a repeat incident and possibly they would reopen my case.  They did NOTHING!!!  Not even a Reimbursement for the two weeks or the mileage.  A repeat case???

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2019,IB, 12/08/2018,V8 is recommended,3,"This is an updated review after 6 months of owning 2019 Supercharged model. 
I am still very satisfied with the performance of the V8 engine, the comfort and looks of the car as well. No mechanical issues at all. Had a flat tire and it was nice to have a full-size spare with matching rim in the car. 

Unfortunately, things I am not satisfied with are several.
- Inappropriate low-profile tires in this capable off-road SUV. It defeats the purpose. 
- The large panoramic moon-roof allows in too much heat, even after installing window tint on it. 
- Back up camera: low resolution and most likely wireless connection as it breaks up. The camera itself is mounted off center to the side of the license plate which distorts the dimensions when trying to back up. 
- The SIM card never worked. AT&T did not even recognize the car VIN number. 
- The car does not save my settings, simple things like A/C temperature, Wi-Fi password, or last audio channel I used. 
- The car does not have CD player. Trying to play music from USB stick does not work well as system will always restart in FM next time, and when going back to USB it will always start from song number 1 and will never recall where it left. 
- Rear entertainment system: this is subscription service over AT&T. No actual DVD tray. Connecting external DVD player to HDMI port did not work well. Very disappointed children.
- Navigation system: Hard to zoom in and zoom out in as it is completely touch screen.  The map graphics are not the best. The navigation screen is wide but too short (about 3-4 inches) only showing a small stretch of the road ahead of you. The font on the map is too small.
- Auto start-stop function would have saved some gas if it would last more than 10-20 seconds with the engine off. Apparently the battery is not sufficient to power everything and the car restarts itself very shortly after a stop on a traffic light.

I have had absolutely no issues with electronic screens or camera, though I understand that updates were made. I'm not towing or driving off road but I am impressed with the fit and finish, comfort, trying, technology and ride. The supercharged 6 provides plenty of power and torque. UPDATE....The automatic engine shut off when you come to a stop is a major annoyance and you can only disengage it for the current ride, not permanently. The park assist feature is not near as good the technology on most every other brand of car, it is very basic and ineffective technology. The process of changing the various dash screens is not at all intuitive and forget trying to update the home screen.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2019,from Personal Experience, 05/28/2019,Not Sporty nor Reliable,1,"For the price that is paid, one would expect monitor interface that does not lag, a back up camera that does not black out, a basic features such as an easy entry option for seats and steering wheel. Instead, the opposite is found with the Range Rover Sport. In addition, the car name ""Sport"" is misleading. Pressing on the gas, one feel no power despite the gas wasting turbocharger. If your interested in useless widgets and add-ons then look no further.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2019,ICEX2BB, 08/16/2019,Stoked with my new RR Sport,4,"This SUV is great in every aspect. Electronics could be a bit quirky but I'm not losing sleep over it; they sufficiently provide the functions needed consistently enough that if exceptionally something fails I'm not upset at the world.  Lots of luxury, utility, technology and plenty of power. Having said that, (i couldn't stress this enough) KNOW what you're buying, test drive it before buying. If you hear people complain is either a) lemon b) their sheer inability to understand options, failing to test drive or going for the base model to save money... (Facepalm)

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2019,Frank Milstead, 09/01/2019,Off the charts,5," I love this car. I purchased the V8 supercharged dynamic. The coach work is impressive, as the interior is inviting and sporty. The driving characteristics of the car especially in the dynamic mode allows you to have a sports car while driving an SUV. I really enjoy the sound from the Meridian system.  It makes you want to listen to most of your music loud. I love the Apple CarPlay feature as it allows me to use all of my Apple features hands-free. The heft and the solid feel of the car makes you wonder is built from the solid block of billet aluminum. I find not much to be offended by, I drove all of the new SUVs before buying this one and I have disappointments.  It has a ton of eyeball and the sound to go with it. Looking back I would’ve opted for a few more features, but this one is nicely equipped. My previous rover was the V6 with the supercharger and there is no comparison. I also had a Porsche Cayenne diesel which I loved as well. I thought about the diesel motor again for the Rover, but I wanted the sports car feel of the dynamic V-8.

land-rover,range-rover-sport,2019,Michael Furman, 09/16/2019,Range Rover Sport Autobiography,5,"It’s basically the best SUV period always will be and there is litterally no reason to ever think otherwise. The only actual competitor the Range Rover has is the G63 AMG, and that’s really for those who just want to try something different because they have owned multiple Range Rovers in the past or want second SUV. Even when compared to high end Rolls Royce, Bentley, and Lamborghini options. None ever come close to what a Range Rover offers as an entire package, IF YOU HAVE THE V8 SUPERCHARGED/AUTOBIOGRAPHY/SVR.

The only issue which technically is a positive for some, ALL Range Rover Sports look alike.
The upper models base price are 87,000 for supercharged and 97,000 for Autobiography/ SVR starts at 113,000 (estimated for 2019 models I’m not 100% sure off the top of my head exactly)  ALL but the SVR when you compared it to the cheap HSE model look IDENTICAL, I MEAN IDENTICAL. I can easily pick apart difference in all porsche generations and models, and these ranges are completely the same. 

I’m 32 and my second car as a family car spending 104,567 msrp I really would have preferred to stand out from the generic HSE for 70k. Although to be fair that’s more of a personal vain issue. While it is a massive personal annoyance, I appreciate the fact I fly under the radar completely.  Because 94% of Range Rover Sports in the DMV area (dc Maryland Virginia) are HSE. 4.5% are Supercharged 1% are autobiographies and .5% are SVR’s

The HSE model are for people who want to say they have a Range Rover and not much else. Options for that engine size is also limited. For Example, you WILL NOT be able to get 22 positions seats with Massage unless you’re spec’ing an Autobiography. 

6 cylinder for a car with curb weight wel into 5,300 pound range AND qualifies for over 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight being powered by 6 cylinder 300ish HP, just get out and push you’ll go faster, the worst part is you can’t even bring the luxury level up to anything acceptable at that price point. 

So in summary, if you buy the HSE, you will get a average product that everyone who understands knows you’re just a poser who can’t afford a “Real Range Rover Sport” aka the V8 versions.  Because with 517+ HP and a 0-60 time of 5.1 seconds ( that’s faster than a 996 porsche Carrera) or 4.3 with the SVR ( faster than my 2013 E92 M3 with DCT) PLUS the luxury PLUS the world class off roading. It’s not a choice it’s a no brainer. Lambo suv will be faster but less comfortable for all passengers and worse off roading performance and probably less comfortable seats. Bentley will be way worse off-road, marginal upgrade in comfort at best most likely no difference just style, better performance and way worse styling. Rolls Royce is just No! It’s really just an oversized phantom. G36 Amg is 167 (with options) shorter no air suspension more road noise and equal or better off road. 

So if you have, as near as makes no difference 100k to spend on an SUV buy a Range Rover Sport 2019. Yes there is some lag with the infotainment (but it always ends up working) but reliability is much better than expected from multiple stories of people owning older Rovers (2016). The Range Rover Sport and full-size is simply the greatest SUV ever created by man in the history of man. While all other car makers try and replicate it and come up short "

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,V. Thomas, 08/14/2018,Serious Velar Blues,2,"I purchased my beautiful (aesthetics) Velar on 1/28/2018. An eye-catching beauty that fit my personality and style. My vehicle has been to the service center 5 times, not for routine maintenance, but for the crappy HVAC, entertainment system and now the engine light is on. I was told by my service advisor that ""I should rest assured that I had a very sound vehicle and Land Rover stands behind each and every vehicle"". I made it through reading the first 4 or 5 reviews and immediately knew I had found a home for my Velar Blues. The best way to help you understand my issues and frustrations, please see the following list:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
1. 8/9/18- Engine light came on again at 0630 on my 45-mile (one way) commute to work, I called my service advisor and left him a message 
2. 8/8/18 Engine light came on at 1600, instead of going home I drove straight to the dealership, the light was cleared by my service associate at the dealer, he said it was an O2 sensor, if it came on again, call him personally!
3. Persistent issues with HVAC in the winter the windows would fog over while driving...had to turn on A/C to remedy...they fixed it (I think) but now when I turn on A/C it blows straight heat for 10 minutes then will cool
4. The seat warmer intermittently warms/cools when in off position 
5. Radio was making cracking noise when Bluetooth playing through my phone...they fixed it
6. The driver side rear passenger door sensor went bad and the part was ordered from the UK and has since been replaced, but the handle is now very loose like it will fall off with the next car wash
7. LIM mode activated while car was being driven and couldn’t exceed 20mph, the instruction book indicated that the feature requires multiple steps to activate but the dealer says I accidentally activated it from the steering wheel
8. The console blanked out “went completely black” while being driven...restarting the car did not fix the issue...2 hours later after car was parked...the issue self-resolved
9. Radio will turn on when car is off and parked and will remain on when the doors have been secured and locked, I have to depress the ignition button twice to get it to turn off                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       10. Currently, I am waiting on a new O2 sensor AND a ""part"" or ""update"" for the HVAC to stop blowing hot air and warming the seats when it's not supposed to!
I think that’s everything...Moral of the story...DON'T buy the 2018 Velar ever OR at least wait until the kinks have been worked out.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Lane Gleeson, 03/01/2018,Buyer beware,1,"I would strongly suggest anyone interested in purchasing a Velar to reconsider.  The vehicle’s defrost does not work which is the largest issue.  We’ve been told there is a temporary fix.. so we spent $75k on a car that is completely unsafe to drive.  The thing that upsets me the most is that this was a demo, whoever drove the car that works at the dealership for 3k miles should have known this.  Why wasn’t the issue fixed before selling it?!?  In addition the screens continually stop working while driving so we cannot see any of the necessary items while driving (speed, rpms, etc.).  Now the sunroof is refusing to close.  BUYERS BEWARE.  We will be trading in this car ASAP.  It’s just so unfortunate that we will lose money on it when these should have been non issues.  I will never purchase a Range Rover ever again and I will spread the word.  They were clearly not ready to release the Velar but did so anyways.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Natalie, 03/26/2019,"Beautiful vehicle, but completely unreliable",2,"There's no doubt about it that the Velar is a beautiful vehicle; I fell in love with it the first time I laid eyes on it!  But the look of the car is nothing compared to the ISSUES under the hood.  I've had the car now for just over 8 months and have had issue after issue with the displays and electrical system.  From early on, I started noticing my displays glitching.  Sometimes it would resolve as the car warmed-up; most times I would have to stop my car, turn it off, lock the car and then unlock/restart my car to resolve the issues.  This happens on a very regular basis.  Given I'm a professional with a very busy travel schedule, taking my car in for service is not something I have a lot of time to do AND one of the reasons I chose a car that only needed annual maintenance!  Since I thought I had a fix for these display issues, I figured I could wait to bring it in for service.  That was my bad- should have done it sooner than I did.  However, when I did take my car in for a ""complimentary top off service"", I brought this up to them and they had my car for 4 days doing a ""software update"".  Seems strange it would take that long for a software update, but what do I know.  Yesterday, as I tried to leave for work and I could not start my car and it wasn't because of a battery issue.  The car completely froze and locked up on me (the brake somehow depressed itself completely into the floorboard), I was unable to start the car (and the car was telling me Ignition ON) and my steering was pretty much frozen- all the while my displays, climate control and music were working.  The car had to be towed to the dealership where after having it for over 24-hours, they finally diagnosed the problem and have to replace the Telematics Control Unit.  They have to REPLACE a complete unit on a brand new car!  And they have to ask for authorization to purchase this new unit due to the price of it!   So I'll be without a car while this authorization takes place, then while they wait for the part to arrive and then while they install the new unit.  Who knows if this will ultimately fix the on-going display glitches (because those were still happening AFTER this 4 day software update).  The fact my car has had ANY service so far is concerning.  The fact that my car needs such an important piece REPLACED completely is completely unacceptable.  Do not buy this car.  Wait a few years for newer models to come out.  They don't  know how to fix or maintain them at this point.  And it's a total time suck and frustrating process for the owner.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Kevin Anahory, 04/14/2019,Major Disappointment,2,"Was one of the first to buy the Velar in 2018.  Love the look and drive of the Velar and must admit was all in on the prestige of owning a Land Rover.  Right away the issues started occurring i.e...windows fogging, infotainment system having frequent glitches and auto stop not working properly.  Within the first three months, I had to bring the car back in for a recall, where the dealer had to run an update on the system.  During the stay in the garage, the dealership rear-ended my velar which caused me to lose the use of the vehicle for approximately 10 days.  To make things right the dealer gave the use of Evoque (drives worse than an Altima) and a free oil change (which at the time I thought was laughable until I found out that an oil change in a Velar at the dealer costs $500).  When my car was returned, I chalked it up to bad luck.  The issues seemed to have been corrected (except for the auto stop, which my salesman told me was working properly because the system wouldn't stop in certain conditions (a lie!)).  After about a year, the engine light turned on.  I had to wait a month and a half for an appointment to get it serviced.  When I finally brought it in they had the car for a day and told me that a sensor was the issue and they had corrected it.  I went to pick it up and wouldn't you know it the engine light was still on.  The dealer took it back and after another week, I had my car back, but the interesting thing was that all of a sudden the auto stop was now working properly!  Again, while I was upset, I did love the drive of the car so I again chalked it up to some bad luck.  Two months later the vehicle issued a warning that only front wheel drive was available for my AWD Velar.  Brought it to the dealer where the Service Rep warned me that in his experience this leads to more issues (something to do with the transmission).  After another 10 days of not having my vehicle (Part had to be shipped from England) and driving a loaner (New Discovery, which again drives worse than an Altima) I got my Velar back.  This time I complained to Land Rover after my salesman indicated that possibly Land Rover corporate might do something for me in terms of getting me into another vehicle.  Followed his advice (don't know why?) and waited for three weeks to have the Complaint Department tell they'd be happy to give me some free oil changes.  Told them to keep the oil changes.  I'll be trading in my Velar for something that isn't constantly in the shop.  In my opinion they rushed the Velar into production, which is understandable however the failure to do the right thing, will prompt me never purchase a Land Rover again.

■Great looking
■Very smooth ride
■Dash layout is very customizable

Bottom line, I should have sat with the Tech guy before I made the purchase. The car has some great features but some things don't make since.

Spent $98k on a brand new velar and the thing has been to the dealer for repairs 3 times already. Everything I heard about ranger rover’s horrible reliability is 100% true. The remote start doesn’t work randomly. The infotainment system goes out randomly. I got stuck on the side of the road when all the instrumentation inside blacked out.

A few wks before bringing it in for the 6hr upgrade it needed, the Lovely Velar I left in park & running in my driveway decided to drive itself (while still in park) right into the back of my legs and garage. Since the garage door button was not working in the car i had to get out of the car to open it. Yup car literally pinned me against the garage.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Glenn H, 01/02/2018,"Velar looks good, feels great",5,"We were looking for a medium-size SUV with sharp exterior styling and luxurious interior, so settled on the new Velar as the best intersection of those qualities with reasonable cost. It seats five adults fairly comfortably and has enough cargo room for trips. We found a few other purchase options that were somewhat similar, but weighed at least 500 pounds more and cost at least $10K more. Only one option, the Porsche Macan, had a sportier look and drive feel, but it was compromised in terms of rear seat room and cargo space. We also like the bigger Range Rover Sport, but it's interior (at that time), while luxurious, was dated compared to the extremely modern, clean layout of the Velar's. We were reluctant to buy any four-cylinder car, but the surprising torque of the 247-hp Velar 250 won us over in the end. It's no hotrod, but we drove a long trip in it and never felt it was underpowered. We live in a moderate climate, so didn't care much about the Velar's cold weather features (four heated seats, heated steering wheel, remote start/warmup) , but they worked very well when we traveled to a colder area. The electronics may be the best thing about the Velar. The standard sound system is quite adequate and the navigation is good for an automotive system. (No built-in automobile nav is in in the same league as Google Maps on a cell phone.) But the three-section display of the Velar is as good as it gets. Big touchscreens and very configurable. The net result is a non-geek driver can set up the controls so they can actually be used without reading the manual every time you want to do something. Most modern cars have more electronic features than any driver can use, but the Velar's seem intuitive enough that someone can use the important ones. So far, we are getting a little over 21 miles to the gallon of premium gas. That seems subjectively a bit low, but for a 4200 pound car is acceptable. During the first six months of driving the Velar, the only glitch has been a dead battery, which is still somewhat mysterious, but very likely has to do with what I call ""pseudo-shutdown."" When in ""eco"" mode the engine can mimic a shut off when the transmission is placed in Park. The instrument panel does not give a clear indication of a problem (especially with lights in delayed-off auto mode), so it is possible to leave the car's ignition on in the garage. This will drain the battery completely within 36-48 hours. Or so it seems to me and the techs at the Range Rover dealership. The only other unwelcome surprise is the black roof trim of the R-Dynamic package. It looks great, but the pillars are made of plastic so soft that absolutely all brush-type car washes leave noticeable permanent swirl marks.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Alex, 10/04/2018,Don't do it. The negative reviews are spot on,2,"I leased the SE R-dynamic, V4 because the car was the only one with a modern design and great looks and I though it's a Land Rover what can go wrong?
The answer is a lot. Windshield cracked, JLR said it was because of a stone, it was not it is poor quality. Many people are having the issue. But the biggest issue is the noise level, engine vibration and interior ride quality. There is an unreasonable amount of noise in the cabin while driving and at idle. JLR dealer said this is normal, but at a $65K car this is not acceptable. The stop/start is awful, had it stalls and the restart is do jarring that my kids are getting car sick. So every time I start the car I have to disable it, very annoying and again for a $65K car this is not acceptable.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Jeff C, 09/17/2018,My First Range Rover,4,"I decided to lease a Velar SE Dynamic-R about 2 months ago.  The look of the vehicle really got me.  So far I have had zero issues with it as you would expect with it being so new.  I was initially concerned about going with the 4-cylinder engine after only having V8s for the past 10 years but the turbo and power from the 4-cylinder were very impressive and adequate for me.  The digital screens in the dash and console are amazing.  I love being able to project the navigation across the dash.  I really only have one complaint so far and that is with the Auto Start/Stop feature.  It is defaulted to be on every time you start the car and I have to go into the menu and turn it off every time I get into drive.  I wish it was defaulted to off and I only turned it on when I want to use it, which so far is never. I get lots of compliments on the car everywhere I go.  The red with the black interior and black out kit on the outside with the 21 inch wheels really stands out from the crowd.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Tim D, 12/11/2019,Velar Voice Activated NAV,1,"I leased the car in Nov 17....was told it had xm radio and that it would connect once we got it home to activate....it did not, and could not, we had to undo the entire transaction and take our trade back. Ordered new Velar with  the options we wanted. 


We were told that voice activation for nav would be installed in a few weeks, then in a few more weeks then in a few months. It's been 2 yrs and we still don't have this very important feature. We have scheduled several appts with the store both routine and non routine issues.  It's always terrible scheduling and trying to get a loaner.  They always tell us it will be few hours  then keep the car for another day or two. 

This note from one of the appts from the salesman, ""An Appointment here at dealership to re install in control and help with connectivity issues.

System reset email with vin has been sent to land rover and we should have that response by Monday."" We had 3 of these appts. My time is extremely valuable.

Finally last month after receiving an email from an executive at LandRover I responded. I was able to get the car in and get a loaner within 2 days. They said they could fix it.  They gave me the car back the next day and told me that the new software was installed and that  if my wife would follow the instructions to  ""teach the car her voice she would be able to use the ""in control"" Landrover voice activated NAV....She did everything and it still does not work. I wrote to the VP at corporate to share this yesterday....still no response.  They are either unable to communicate, idiots, or liars. I dont know for sure yet. 

I have always bought Mercedes and BMW, but this time, because my wife loved the look and lines on the Velar I  went forward...my wife and I hate the service and the seemingly endless inability to give us what we want and paid for in a timely manner.  The last time my wife traded phone calls with Richard who promised to call her back with the GPS voice activation software status and simply never did.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Dave Pettingill, 08/08/2018,Breautiful Velar That's Where It Stops,2,"Our Velar came with paint distortions which took the dealership 3 visits to finally get resolved.  We were promised that the car had voice activated navigation however very soon after taking delivery it did not have voice activated navigation.  The car is equipped but Land Rover has not provided the software to make it work.  You have to type on a screen in order to hopefully find the address you're looking for.  Finally after two months a new software release was installed which provided ""Go Home"", ""Cancel"", ""Navigate to previous destination"", that's it.  The car is beautiful, it's strong, and with the 380hp engine it really moves.  We are hoping to get voice activated navigation, we use that a lot.  Overall the dealership was a total disappointment, hopefully other dealerships in the nation will be better for this high end car!!

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,David, 06/02/2018,Great Vehicle That Is Step Forward,5,"I have owned numerous new Range Rovers over the years including all the body models they make.  Most recently was a 2015 Range Rover Sport SuperCharged.  The modern look of the Velar appears to have made the other RR's look dated.  I selected the 380 R Dynamic HSE.  Loaded it up like the First Edition - minus the First Edition Wheel since I like the Gray 21 inch wheel more (it shows allot less brake dust in the matte finish).   Performance is good - -and I would have said great - - if not for just having the RR S SC.   Other than that extra oomph of the RR Sport's performance I would say I prefer the Velar in all other ways - - from sound system, electronic interface to the lower access height (previous RR has deployable step but the Velar is still a more convenient access height).   For the technology blunt buyer there will be a learning curve.  Also, having the current MB S class I would actually say I prefer the RR approach on the technology interface - - more intuitive in many ways - - - additionally the customization of the screens and your personalize home screen is nice.  And of course, the humorous graphics are funny (when was the last you saw a iconic British Phone Booth used in a car's graphics).  Lighting at night is great, I was a bit fearful that high noon sun would minimize some of the screens but that has not been the case.  I was not impacted by the defroster recall although it seems like a simple software change (4 zone climate control might not be included in recall).   Now on to what is often the biggest concern of a LR or RR buyer - - - reliability -  - well other than one recall over the years and one dead accessory battery I have NEVER had an issue with any of my RRs.   However there are some things I always mandate - - low miles - - I mean LOW LOW LOW miles (if the vehicle has more than 20 miles) I won't take it.  I fear so many vehicles are abused in their first 100 to 200 miles on a dealer lot - so what should be a break-in period is really a 'ya broke it period'.   And of course, a demo is off the list because there is no luxury in a vehicle that had a hundred unknown butts all over its seats.  Also - - read a bit of the owners manual - - - many people can read countless gossip tweets and boring self absorbed Facebook postings but something you trust with your life,  you don't read.   I would strongly recommend the vehicle to a person who understands exactly what they are looking to purchase.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,K. Andrews, 11/18/2020,First edition...test lab,2,"Like other reviewers I too love the styling and design of the Velar. So much so that I purchased a First Edition. Like I others, I have also experienced the constant ongoing, relentless problems of the Velar. Interior fogging, infotainment system glitches, winter tires not calibrating, battery losing charge and needing roadside assistance to tow!

What is most disappointing is the LR attitude - quite simply put they don't care. Idiots like us keep buying. I have two Audi vehicles and one cannot compare the quality and service with that of LR. It is truly such a shame that such great styling suckers us in to spend thousands on such poor quality. Speak up LR what say you?

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2018,Sean Sarkar, 05/13/2019,Perfect for my needs,5,"Before the Velar I have had a BMW 3 series, an X5 and most recently a 5 series. It was time for a change to an SUV and I narrowed it down to the Velar, X4, Q5 and Volvo XC60. I was literally blown away by the handling, style and the interior. As an IT guy I love technology and felt the Velar had the best features for the buck, a nifty UI and center console that looks just amazingly uncluttered. Yes, (as noted in other reviews) there is a bit of a lag in the UI and it will be great if they can make it more responsive but considering how much features they have put into it I am A-Ok with it. If the X4's handling is hard and the XC60's is soft it sits somewhere in between a Q5 and X4 IMHO. I have only had it for a month and have loved driving every moment of it. Haven't had a chance to go on a long drive yet but with whatever city driving I have done so far it's been mostly in the normal and R-dynamic mode. You'll seriously fall in love with driving in the R-Dynamic mode and the only reason I still use the normal mode is to save on gas. Which brings me to my gripes so far... 1. the mileage. I am using premium gas but getting only 17.5 mpg while averaging 25 mph in all city driving. I dont really push on the gas after a stop either so not sure if my mpg is normal or not but am really hoping after a few long drives or with maybe more time it'll improve :). 2. The sound from the audio is rich and very nice but sometimes I get a crackling noise during phone calls and certain songs, this has been happening on and off and I haven't really been able to narrow it down to whether it's an issue with the song i am streaming from my phone, the bluetooth connection or the Velar's audio system. It's never happened while playing regular FM/AM radio but has happened a couple of times when playing Sirius so go figure.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2019,Rovering Rover, 12/13/2018,Technology galore,5,"If your looking for a mid size luxury SUV then you should at least consider the Range Rover Velar.  This is my first Land Rover and I'm quite impressed with the quality and workmanship of this vehicle.  Although they don't come cheap, I think that you will find the technology very rewarding and enjoyable.  The ride is wonderful and the 2.0 liter turbo is very responsive and provides very good fuel economy.  The age old concern is Land Rover reliability but I'll hope for the best in a second year model and cross that bridge when it comes but for now I'm very impressed with my Range Rover Velar.

Update to my first review still finds my Velar with no issues. The car continues to be a fun car to drive and even more so now that I’ve had time to figure out more of the technological features. Great vehicle and very satisfied with my purchase.

Update to my purchase- After 15,000 miles my vehicle is still a joy to drive. No buyers remorse at all.

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2019,Debcos, 12/16/2019,"This car is not reliable, don't buy it",2,"Unfortunately, since the time I bought this car (end of September 2018) I had many issues with my new Land Rover Velar 2019. First issues were mostly electrical (screen not working, error messages while being stopped at a red light, back camera not working, etc. I took the car in two opportunities and they explained these cars usually need software updates. I thought I should not waste my time taking the car to the dealer but did it…. I also had a weird noise with the breaks. They had to change them. Then I had to take the car for the Annual Service. They checked everything and in less than a month, my engine light was on! Took the car AGAIN and they said it was another engine software (not sure why no one update this when I took the car for my annual service?). But after taking the car 2 times, in less than a month my engine light went on AGAIN!! I was so upset and frustrated. The dealer suggested me that I contact Land Rover Customer Service for a Re-Purchase, as it’s obvious to me I have a defective car… After talking to someone for 38 minutes, she asked me many questions about my car, even if I have already paid for the car which we did, she simply said my case didn’t apply for re-purchase. She didn’t explain why or what was the criteria. Her only “solution” was for me to keep taking my car to the dealer. What type of solution is this? I asked to talk to her supervisor. She said he would call in the next 5 hours which he didn’t. He called passed the 5 hours and left a message saying I should follow this with the customer service representative, like ignoring my request of talking to him….
I’m EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED WITH LAND ROVER CUSTOMER SERVICE. My advice is: if you want a car that works and is reliable, PLEASE don’t buy this car, it’s gorgeous but it’s not reliable and customer service will not help you at all. They will just send you to the dealer and you will waste your time and money taking the car for service many times.

I received a velar as a loaner today while my Jaguar is in for service and I have to say the car is so amazing that I had to write a review for it. Yes, the car is expensive but I have to say it is comparable with BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. The interior is attention to detail and the technology has improved drastically. I have a $65,000 Jaguar and I was kind of disappointed that the interior wasn’t as great as BMW(my previous car) but I still love my Jaguar because Jaguar Land Rover drive is above and beyond with the handling and responsiveness. For those looking for a new SUV, you have to give the velar a try. It may not be reliable but neither are other German cars lol. This is truly an amazing car and the depreciation on land rovers are a lot better than German cars as well!!

land-rover,range-rover-velar,2019,Bon Fit, 10/22/2020,Worst vehicle I have ever owned!!!!! DON'T BUY IT!,1,"My 2019 Velar R has been plagued with issues from the day I drove it off the lot.  It was in service the next day!  The infotanement system which is also the heating, air, defrost controls is plagued with issues.  Many times it goes completely black.  You have to shut the vehicle off to get it to reboot.  This also happens when driving & the interface with Apple I-phone is terrible.  They say you need a Apple cord.  It does not help.  It is distracting when driving because it takes your attention off the road putting you in danger of an accident.  Transmission problems on-going from date of purchase.  The worst...I put it in park and was behind the vehicle, it shifted into reverse and almost ran us over. I had to rush into the vehicle and shift it back into park and shut the vehicle off.  The the transmission knob flashes yellow and you cannot get the vehicle to go over 30 mph.  When you applly the gas it slows way down... one of these times it was a fuel pump. Other times when the vehicle shuts off when you stop it will not go back into gear.  When i'm at a stop light I have to shut the vehicle off and restart to get it to go into gear.  This has happened constatntly since the day I got it.  NOT FIXED!  Then there is the issue with coolant fan revving constantly.  I have had it in for this everytime when I took it in for other issues.  Over a year into the lease it had a recall for this but is now doiing it again!  The lane change assist, when on a curved fwy tries very hard to push you into the other lane because it does not know the road is curved.  It is a fight to keep the vehicle in the lane.  tailgate foot swipe to open does not work 80% of the time!  The Turbo lag is the worst of any car I have ever driven!  Terrible engine!  The Land Rover Discovery has better pick-up than the Velar.  I have 15,000 miles on the vehicle and it has been in for service probably 25 times!  I have asked Land Rover ot buy the vehicle back.  They say it doesn't qualify.  I am filing a ""Lemon Law"" case againt Land Rover/Range Rover.  Biggest issue is it is extremely unsafe!!!

land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2000,Adam, 11/06/2015,"Before you buy, how handy are you?",4,"I've been reading a lot of the poor ratings, and I get that you've had bad experiences with the Discovery 2.  They can be fussy, but for very specific reasons.  Let me explain, and perhaps this will help prospective buyers.

Land Rover Disovery Series II is a one of a kind car.  You just can't find cars that do what they do anymore.  We looked at purchasing new SUV's, and you'd end up spending 80K vs 4K for a disco to find a car capable of what the disco is.  IMHO, they were bough for soccer moms in the late 90's and early 2000's.  They are not japanese cars.  They need attention.  They need a lot of attention.  It's when you ignore things that sound wrong, or don't pay attention to rattles or leaks that they go do hell.

Rather than paying a car note of 600 bucks a month to a bank, we decided to pay a good mechanic a third of that to keep our Disco alive and safe and have some gas money.  It works out.  Assume to pay 3-4K per year in upkeep.  That's just used car 101.  Don't subscribe to ""It's a land rover thing"" when stuff breaks.  All used cars break if not attended too.  Rubber deteriorates, parts go bad, you just need to have a budget for it.

Common issues with the Disco:

1: ABS - It's a well documented issue and you can fix it for 5 bucks and a half an hour, if you know what you're doing assuming all sensors are ok.  The ABS module has a short, which can be fixed or bypassed with some knowledge.  You can find all the info on land rover forums.

2: A/C Parts can go bad, but the main thing is that the fuse box can get corrosion, and there's on bad solder point.  again, some knowledge and you can get this fixed in 1/2 an hour for 10 bucks.  Simple stuff, and well documented. 

3: leaks - The head gasket is the big one.  It goes bad.  Most have been replaced by 2015.  I just had mine done a second time.  I don't think the original replacement was done right, but we drive ours everywhere, so who knows.  Rubber goes bad.  Most of the seals should be replaced within 15 years anyway.  Again, not a japanese car. 

Land rovers are technically somewhat complex in that the have many computers and sensors to manage everything.  But, electrical issues are fairly easy to diagnose with a multimeter.  You have to have some knowhow or interest in learning.  Those electrical issues are the expensive ones because you typically have to go to the dealer to get a good reading, and they will overcharge.  If you can learn the layout, you'll save thousands over time.

Here's the thing... now, cars are completely controlled by even more complex computers.  You're always going to have this hurdle unless you're driving a car from the 70's/80s.   

MOST IMPORTANT THING : If you're handy, it's fun because it's simple enough that you can fix these cars yourself with some  time and interest.    If you just want a car to go from point a to point b . .. you should get a Hyundai.

Many of the things that could go wrong with a discovery have to do with the driver's negligence or driving style. I have taken care of my disco and she has taken care of me. Driving position and view like no other vehicle, fantastic in the snow, and looks good to boot. Dual sunroofs still entertain me to this day and the sound system is really nice.

When maintained properly, these are phenomenal vehicles. It didn't stop being a premier upscale vehicle when you bought it cheap and used, so the maintenance requirements are still that of an expensive European vehicle. Buy one without records and you're rolling the dice. As for me, I have a 2000, 2002, and two 2004 Discos and none have ever broken down. Sure, they have had little problems like any car- broken door lock, wiper motor. Big deal- if you can't afford to maintain a car properly, don't get it."

Don't get ACE or rear air ride. Stick to coil spring model. It is fairly straight forward to fix, the galvanized body and all technical improvements make it huge improvement over Disco 1.

land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2000,Michael McCabe, 01/30/2019,My second Disco,4,"What I can say is that a Discovery will treat you how you treat it. Baby it, do ALL regular maintenance, especially oil changes and checking the coolant. 80% of head gasket replacements are due to failure to change the oil. If you’re in the market, look for one with a good service history, preferably a one owner and that has not been abused over the years. Also be sure to check the frame, especially the rear quarter as sat and dirt build up back there and rot it out. Find yourself a good mechanic who works on European cars and you’ll find that repair cost and parts are not as obnoxious as everyone makes it seem - many mechanics know the stigma that Rovers cost an arm and a leg to fix, it is simply not true, Discovery 2’s are actually very straightforward and easy to work on - most mechanics just take advantage of the stigma. Parts for my Nissan Xterra are more extensive than half the Rover parts! If you maintain it, it is a strong, sturdy truck that is excellent in the snow, off road and for getting around town. And, there’s something about them that is just fun to drive - nothing like it out there! But, select one carefully!

Being a V8 in comparision to the V6 Diamante© sedan I had traded the previously anticipated gas mileage were up there unlike the performance of the engine itself which we're an embarresment to say the least to be even called such

Updated Review 

Amazingly I still have this Vehicle 
Only because I hardly ever drive maybe to get weekly groceries now and then and of course just tow boat locally to boat ramp about five minutes away 

It's just too much of a pig on gas to use as an everyday wagon as I much prefer to either drive my light diesel truck or even better still motorbike

It's a great tower how ever and one time used to pull out a tree stump which in comparison to my brothers Mitsi RVR Awd trying beforehand and not even making a dent were an effortless task 

But then again were to be kind of expected but surprisingly as I were to find not with such ease 

But other than that can't really give a fair review as I hardly ever use other wise as I only really bought this vehicle to begin with for one intended purpose and were mainly for towing my boat for which I am satisfied even if it is only a five minute drive

Excellent off-roading skills .Awesome Harman-Kardon sound system. Very easy to change exterior lightbulbs. Front seats are comfortable. Dual sunroofs are neat. What I hate: Premium gas/bad mileage (12 mpg). It's too narrow or I'm too wide. Windshield wipers are horrible. Dealer service is subpar. Feels unsafe at high speeds. Worthless cupholders & no console space. AAA man hates the oversized lugnuts. Rubber mats around console/dash are difficult to keep clean. Backseat is not very roomy. I've never had any engine problems but little things break all the time.  Unless you have the extended warranty, I would be wary."
land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2000,NorthWestern, 06/15/2005,Fun but costly,3,"We love the car until you need work done- dealership repairs are eye-watering. (parts are reasonable- labor is rediculous). Cupholders are useless, even with small drinks. Gas mileage (14 all-around) is terrible- motor seems underpowered for weight of vehicle. (no wonder new LR3 has 300hp!) Great off-road, I'm sure most people don't use it as such, but as capable or moreso than a jeep. Front windshield is too short, difficult to see red lights if first in line, constantly ducking head to see light change. Rear view mirror not in a good spot- creates a blind spot in view of right hand turns. (I'm 6'3"" so this may be biased.)"

I love my LR but I have issues with a company that won't do recalls on parts they know are faulty. I am on several LR forums and we all have the same problems. Cup holders, head gaskets(I've had 3 replaced, 2 under warranty), ABS modules, etc. I will probably upgrade to the Range Rover when this Disco expires. I have never needed a mechanic till I owned a Land Rover! Now I see him once a month(no lie)!"

land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2000,TheCapn, 11/07/2006,British Steel,4,"Without doubt, a love or hate (or even love/hate) truck. I have not driven a vehicle that I liked or trusted more. This is 4800 lbs of British steel and is hard to break.  Sharp and distinct look. Still a truck, but quite comfortable. Creates sense of performance, reliability, and security whether under extreme conditions, traveling overland, or as a daily driver. Controls intuitive and the view cannot be beaten. Warranty is great.  That said, the mechanical problems one does run into with the Discovery are too common and quite expensive. And it is true, LR is apathetic at best about maintaining customers. Both are frustrating given how much fealty the Disco will inspire."
land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2000,gmoss, 04/26/2007,Great Vehicle,4,My husband bought the Disc II for me--I never would have thought of buying a Land Rover. So glad he did!  I've had it almost 7 years and have thought about a new vehicle but can't find anything I want to replace it with. Love the body style. Too bad the LR3 is so different! The first mechanical problem was just discovered--had to repalce a gasket.  No other problems.  Brakes lasted 60k miles.  A real trooper.
land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2000,DiscoIIOwner, 04/09/2007,7 years with a Discovery II,4,"I have owned this car for 7 years since new. It has the ACE active suspension. I had some initial problems with an electrical contact in the fuse box for the fuel pump. Once the dealer located the problem, the car has been rock solid.  I have owned a 4 runner and an explorer and this car is far more stable and more capable.  The 255X55X18 tires with 4 wheel disc brakes stop on a dime. Stopping distance is better than most other vehicles. Acceleration could be better but I did not buy this for it's performance. Winter traction is great.  I drive I fairly conservatively. The original brakes lasted 57k miles and the original tires lasted 62k miles."

only ""problem"" was getting new brakes 
and rotors at 23,000 miles, but that's 
expected when you live in a hilly town 
like San Francisco.  The scheduled 
maintenance is fantastic.  There are 
rough roads in SF, so I am amazed that 
there aren't more rattles and squeaks.  
The dealer is excellent and though I 
realize that parts and such might cost 
more than other makes, the track record 
so far offers comfort that these 
inevitabilities will be worth it."

Sunroofs rattle. Gas mileage about 16.5 mpg since day one. Paint and interior still look new.  It'll go more places than I'm willing to drive.  Feels like it'll last forever."

The truck is a beast when it comes to repairs, but nothing can match the unique style and upgrade abilities of a Land Rover.  I have suspension work, racks, tires, and a whole list of additional upgrades.  ""Stella"" might be a pain sometimes, but she gets the job done when I need her to.  I live in a cabin in the woods of North Texas now and couldn't imagine not having my Rover.  I am welding a new bumper for her right now.  I'll drive her till she dies, then throw in a diesel!"

My only regret is the resale value is poor, I'm only selling mine to get a newer RangeRover
The 2001 Disco is at an great buy, provided you do your homework.
The price is low because dealer service and parts are expensive, and everthing about the thing is complicated so you need a good mechanic.
Be sure you get detailed service records to be sure it is in good shape.
There are things that go wrong with any old SUV, like main seals and head gasket and tranny, good maint is the key to avoid these.
Take care to check the Disco drivetrain to be sure it isn't ready to go.
If you choose well you will get the best 4x4 ever for a great price."

I have owned her for about 3 months and have put well over 5,000 miles on her.  Yes, parts are a bit more expensive so do some research online for different parts and see if it is up to your budget.  If not, than this vehicle isnt going to be for you anyways. It has many quirky buttons, positions of where the buttons are and there are some interesting flaws of the design.  However, for the size of the vehicle its not all bad and it does handle much better than other SUVs I have owned in the past.

I don't know why people complain about routine maintenance- I did a simple oil change today with no problems. It performs well, its smooth, and its a TANK!

Land Rovers usually get torched by automotive magazines and cosumer reports, but my experience has been the complete opposite. This vehicle has all of the interior luxury you need with a unique body style. It has the british quirkiness but handles like a champ off road. It drives much like a truck on the road but handles suprisingly well for it's dimensions and heighth. I live near Tahoe and have driven it everywhere and back with and the beast does not flinch in snow or mud. Truly amazing experience in bad weather.

It doesn't handle ice puddles, those broke out the bumper and the fog lights, it doesn't handle a real good ice. Granted it didn't have studs which would help any car, but it sat in the even driveway (no hills) and spun and refused to budge to get me get out of 3 inch snow turned to ice.

The downside? $520.00 to repair the driver side window.  Premium gasoline only. Expensive and almost monthly ""little"" repair issues.  If you have a second vehicle as back up then you're okay. All in all, they are a dream to drive, but definitely a labor of love. Towing our travel trailer is not a problem at all.

I wanted coil springs and solid (live) axles on both ends as I like to go four wheeling. I also wanted one I could easily hook a CLD up (center locking dif-transfercase) to make four wheeling a little better. The Hill Descent Control works well, it'll let you crawl off a STEEP mountain by using the ABS, you don't have to touch anything. Being it didn't have a CLD from the factory, it uses traction control to make the four wheel drive work, and it does fine, although it's less of a sure feeling then a true locking transfercase would be. It's one of the best STOCK four wheel drives you can get to go in the dirt."

They truly are unreliable and very expense to replace parts. I have had mine in for service over six times in the last year. $4500 for a new transmission, $500 for new brakes, $200 for new windershield wiper control and the list goes on. Even though you might be tempted to buy this Land Rover for such a seemingly low cost, there is a reason for its huge depreciation. "

it back, they just gave me $200 
towards more service.  GREAT, thanks.  
If resale wasn't so bad I'd get rid of 
the darn thing.  This was a certified 
too, soon as the warranty is up, I 
have no choice but to get rid of it, 
it would cost a fortune to fix.  If

years ago that Land Rover has yet to 
successfully repair.  Service is

I will never feel comfortable in a smaller car again.  BUT when it comes time to pay the piper, I pay BIG.  Brakes and tires are very costly.  ""Routine"" maintenance will drop you to your knees ($800 for 65k checkup!).  It's an expensive car, so expect to pay for it.  You will pay an extra $100 a month if you average out your repairs and maintenance and $200 a month for gas. Get the extended warranty!!  I dropped a drive shaft @ 70k."
land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2001,John, 05/16/2006,The novelty can wear off after a while,2,"Though it's a fairly new car, it's outdated compared to the competitors.  The 4.0L V8 (188 hp) is seriously underpowered but I hear that the 2003+ 4.6L version does marginally better. Fuel economy averages 14 mpg...the vehicle is just too heavy for the engine which causes you to really tromp the gas just to keep up in traffic.  Expect oil/transfer case/transmission pan gasket leaks everywhere...long-term reliability has me a little nervous.  Maintenance costs are expensive & more frequent compared to more modern vehicles.  Expect around $900 for the 60k mile service.  For commuting, any other luxury SUV would be a better choice.  If I make 100k miles without major repairs, I'll be shocked."
land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2001,ericapb, 12/08/2006,I'll never buy another one,3,"The maintenance on the Discovery has been a pain and extremely expensive. I bought the extended warranty for $2,200 and it has already paid for itself 3 times over.  When the warranty runs out, I will be trading that car in as fast as possible. Plus the mileage is horrible (11 city, 13 highway on a good day) and the fact that it takes ONLY premium gas makes it much more expensive. Even if you try to put in Plus gas for one tank, the car starts vibrating.  All in all, the car was not what I expected from a brand of cars that considers itself LUXURY."

Other Disco owners will come up and talk to me when I'm out and about, and it really feels like belonging to a club or something.--I've never experienced anything like this in Houston before.

However, if you have more money, you should seek a Range Rover.  Whatever type of Land Rover vehicle you own, make sure your wallet can handle it.  With expensive repairs (My front cup-holders were $73 to have replaced), poor gas mileage and a ""boxy"" body, it can cause quite a dent in your finances.  All and all, if you have the money and want a vehicle that you can ""show off"" by being different, this is a great choice."

With all the performance upgrades and off roading accessories, I just couldn't say know.  Had do drop around 4 grand on the truck after working on the drive shafts, brakes, and cat converter.  Spent even more on the suspension, rack, lights, tires and so on.  Bottom line is this:  The truck can go everywhere I want it to and offers more room and better storage than the Jeep would have.  It's an expensive truck, but I like having the Land Rover history under my while I trail drive.  Plus, you can't beat the look of a dressed up Rover."

I am a kid in a candy shop with the added performance in horsepower so like I read in other reviews I'm going Disco until it dies.

There was a new one left in the truck. I replaced it in an hour. Should you get one, read the manual. Learn how to drive it. Learn to put liquids into it (they leak), change filters, change plugs and wires, thermostats and hose. Keep it maintained.  Change all of the plastic hoses with rubber hoses and so on. Change out all of the original parts with OEM parts. Don't take it to a dealer take it to a Rover geek and pay less.

I have put this Rover to the test off road and it surpasses any other 4x4 I have owned. These vehicles are particular and one should know it before you own one. There are quirks that come with ALL Rovers. I have spent money on mine over the 5 years, nothing too major other than a $3k ABS module(most common)-3 Amigos. Land Rover now sells a repair kit for around $100. I have always maintained my Disco very extensively and expect to continue, they are great in the sense that you can have anything repaired on them.

This is my second Discovery - my wife totalled the first at about 70 MPH (all passengers walked away) making replacement a simple choice. This has been an incredibly reliable vehicle, on road and off.  Sure, some services (particularly brakes and tires) aren't cheap, but it is the most solid vehicle I have ever driven and I am willing to pay for quality. Not a squeak or rattle in over 70K fairly hard miles.  Mine has survived Hurricanes Katrina & Rita in addition to several hard Colorado winters without a whimper.

My only big complaint is that the brake and accelerator are too close together. I am now used to it, but anyone who uses the car fresh could be in dangerous territory. My wife let her mother drive it a short distance. She hit the brake and accelerator at the same time (with the same foot) and ran over a mini-van and a handicapped sign!

land-rover,discovery-series-ii,2002,crbtrader, 07/21/2002,A real 4-wheel drive,4,"The Land Rover makes one thing only- 
SUV's.  Unlike other SUV's, it is built 
with the frame, body, and suspension 
that makes you feel like you are in a 
sturdy machine.  It does not drive like 
a boat, but instead has a suspension 
that hugs the road tightly.  Every few 
months the Land Rover company sponsers 
off road events, that let owners really 
go out and learn what off road driving 
is about.  So, for those who plan to 
drive in the city, stick with the 
normal, generic SUV's.  But, if you 
want an SUV that will truly go 
anywhere, anytime, then the Land Rover 
is for you."

used and have never wanted to return 
one until now.  The Discovery looks 
great (that's why we bought it) but 
drives terrible.  The transmission is 
extremely clunky, it feels like it's 
going to fall to the ground.  At 70mph 
an annoying whistle takes over your 
sanity.  Dealer says ""it's normal"".  
Normal for who?  Never had that problem 
with my Geo!  It's very uncomfortable 
and is hard to get in and out of, 
especially in the back.  Did I mention 
all the annoying noises?  Never again!  
Only buy it if you're going to STAY

Very comfortable and great to travel in.
Safe and secure in any kind of road conditions.
Have used it as a truck on the farm - had it in mud up to the hubs and never took it out of AWD high.
Great styling and a tough vehicle.

Only mechanical issues were cam sensor, thermostat, window motor (just took one from a rear window) and purge valve sensor - none of which were expensive to fix."

you have to be a contortionist just to

Make sure that if you are towing that the Dealer hooks up a wiring harness. If you get any check engine lights make sure you get the codes and find out what they are. The Factory made me come back 6 times to replace the intake manifold, and over a month to fix the CD player. Every time you get in and start the unit you are reminded of the terrible placement of the ignition Key. Just could not wait to pay $80.00 dollars US for a pair of wiper Blades, the Dealer comment was that they are good wiper blades! I dont mind paying more for quality, but this is an insult"

The company is a bunch of total [non-permissible content removed] now that have no clue. Sold it and never looked back. I have so much more respect for my LRD1 now! Trust me you will regret it.

on delivery kept the piece of junk in 
the dealers hands for the first month. 
When we finally got to test the vehicle 
on a longer trip, ominous clunking 
noises from the transmission kept us 
from trying it out. Engine noise, 
horrible performance and terrible gas 
mileage are  the price we are paying 
for keeping up with the Jones. The most 
disappointing thing in the whole 
landrover ownership ordeal is the truly 
horrendous way in which landrover 
ignores clients who shell out $40,000.
I do hope it is not Ford who has set up

over the Disco I with better build 
quality, including a roomier and 
quieter cabin.  The DII handles and 
rides quite well on the road, though  
it is sprung fairly tight for offroad 
use.  The DII is a pretty wide (and 
long) rig.  When offroading, the width 
of the rig can be a problem on narrower 
two-track trails.  Branches,rocks and 
other debris that may miss a narrower 
rig will snag your DII.  Surprisingly, 
some DII SD models are also not being 
equipped with a trailer hitch receiver 
as standard equipment--and it is a 
fairly expensive option.  If you camp 
(or smoke) you'll also miss the 
cigarette lighter--my SD came with a 
dummy plug."

I could drive right up a mountain.  My mother hates trying to get in and out of

common 
problem with this engine.  Watch out, 
Land Rover service staff will not

your head gasket is shot while your

thing, but it can, however, do almost 
anything from hauling kids, to cruising 
the highway, to trudging through snow 
and mud, to finding the most remote 
area of a forest, very well. The 4WD is 
uncompromising. The road manners are 
firm and in control. The brakes are 
intelligent and unrelenting. It will 
tow boats, ATVs, snowmobiles, anything, 
comfortably behind you. If you live an 
adventurous lifestyle, this is a great 
vehicle with some quirks or 
shortcomings that you might expect from 
a multi-purpose vehicle."

I always wanted one and took the plunge just recently on a 02 all black with new tires, this is going to be my winter vehicle and I’m driving it back and forth to work 30 miles each way, I knew going in these are a gamble and read all the horror stories but I never drove anything like it, sturdy smooth powerful and luxurious all on the most capable 4 wheel system on earth, fun to drive in every situation, all I can suggest is buy one that someone else just did all the maintenance on it if possible and don’t pick over this vehicle just drive it and be amazed.

land-rover,freelander,2002,tylo, 05/05/2012,Doesn't Live Up to Land Rover,3,"This car was expected to be an excellent car, but what we got was far from it. This car has had issues from day one. Each window, excluding the windshield, has had to been replaced at least once, for a total of seven times because they would not roll up or down. The car currently only has 60,000 miles on it, but only two years after buying the car, the transmission had to be replaced at a whopping $6000. Roughly four years ago, the engine had overheating problems, and since then, we've only been able to drive it short distances, which kept things at bay. This car wasn't built very well, but hey, it is a nimble little SUV, and is still fun to drive. I just don't touch the manual shifter.."
land-rover,freelander,2002,Budu, 10/16/2010,Night mare,2,"I have spent over $12,000 on this car, $7,500 of which at a dealership to fix the engine, with no luck. Then the transmission broke down and that took another $4,000. It has been out for less than 200 miles and the service engine light is on. This car is so lovable but such a nightmare. Are there new model engines and transmissions that can work on this 2002 Freelander?"
land-rover,freelander,2002,Patty, 07/08/2010,We love our Landrover Freelander,4,There's a Landrover club and many other Freelander owners love theirs as we love ours and have had no problems with it other than normal wear items.  It seems the only ones writing reviews are ones that have had problems but most Freelander owners I know have a good and reliable experience with theirs.  
land-rover,freelander,2002,wildrover, 09/11/2006,nothing but troubles,3,"I have had NOTHING but problems with my Rover. It has overheated 4X. Been in the dealership for overheating 3X. They tell me the overheating is due to something different each time. so this time it is in a different shop, since it is now not under warranty. I searched for mechanics - no one wants to touch it. I finally found a place to fix it.. & they are charging me $900.00. They say it needs a new water pump and they have to take apart 1/2 the engine to get to it. I owe the dealership that I bought it from $1000.00 for its MANY other repairs. I am a single mom.. & my credit is awful, so I can't trade it in. I am working to pay for my work transportation. ERGH ! frustrating !"
land-rover,freelander,2002,offroadfanatic, 09/29/2012,"Highly Recommend - Superb features, unbeatable value!",4,"I bought this car a few years back, primarily on the fact that I could afford it and it basically met my needs.
I had to put a little work into it, but nothing more than you would expect out of a car with 100k miles on it.
Minor things have stopped working like the cruise control but nothing that's worth bothering fixing.

This CUV has acceptable clearance and can accept tires 4 inches taller than what's stock (my estimate) and give it a lot more capability off road regarding clearance.
Now, the best part of this car is the amazing capabilities.
Aside from the luxury accessories - heated seats and windshield, etc.
The performance of this little guy is absolutely amazing - on & off road!"

land-rover,freelander,2002,My dream SUV, 09/08/2010,This SUV made me sad,2,"Land Rover Freelander 2002 was my dream SUV but I had sad news about this car. After 8 months and 60000 miles I had to replace the fuel pump and head gasket. Not mechanics were available to fix this vehicle, not guarantee. I had to pay $4,000.00 to fix this truck and I really was mentally affected for all the problems that this truck gave to me. I not recommend this truck to anybody. I had to give this in trading. Then, I received a letter from Land Rover about a recall part but I didn't have the freelander on my own. But, I had the all receipts, the answer from Land Rover was that if I don't have the truck with me I can not going to receive refund for all that I paid."
land-rover,freelander,2002,Shirley Allen, 04/11/2006,Coolant System and Transmission,2,"Transmission had to be replaced. Was still under warranty.  Had to have coolant tank replaced, then thermostat replaced because of constant overheat of engine.  Vehicle in shop. Dealer says engine needs replacing because of cracked engine.  Coolant getting into oil?  These are major problems for a vehicle with only 85000 miles and for the cost to purchase this vehicle. Also brake pad need replacing too often."

We now have over 110k and we've loved driving every mile with this SUV.
We did a lot of research before we made the purchase and knew about the many problems that others have reported with this vehicle, but we have been so pleased with the reliability and fun-ness of the Freelander.
We have not experienced any of the frequent problems that are reported.
Neither my wife or I take very good care of the mechanics of our cars.
We usually go 10-15k between oil changes, we've never changed the transmission fluid, and sparkplugs were replaced for the first time at 95k.
It still runs great and is very reliable."

If you are even thinking about buying a Land Rover Freelander STOP!  Dont waste your money.  Two weeks after I bought it I noticed the engine was over heating and that was the start of my problems.  From the motor, to the windows, to the heat, to the sunroof, to the door locks all had to be replaced with NO RECALLS. I know I put at least $6,000 into it.  The dealership doesnt exist anymore and the Freelander is a huge lemon. I repeat DO NOT BUY A LANDROVER!"
land-rover,freelander,2002,ak, 08/06/2010,Junk car,3,"I bought my freelander with around 42,000 miles on it. I didn't have any problems until the car hit 60,000 miles. Since then, this car has been breaking down like I have never seen before. I had to put a new fuel pump, sun roof, drive shaft, window regulator, cam seals, engine . The vehicle has only 80,000 miles on it currently. I maintain my cars and did all the factory recommended service maintenance. Also most of my driving has been on the interstate. I have a second car I do my city driving with. This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned. I will never by another landrover. Do yourself a favor and stay away from landrovers, unless you want a junk car!"
land-rover,freelander,2002,Ronda, 05/08/2008,What a nightmare!,3,Don't be fooled by the Land Rover name or how the truck drives. These things are a nightmare. I had a gasket replaced at 80000 miles and it seems that I was one of the lucky ones to have mine last that long. I have been told that eventually I will need a new motor. The truck drives great in the snow and will turn heads driving down the road. That is if you can keep it out of the shop long enough to enjoy it. Buyer beware!
land-rover,freelander,2002,Laura E., 11/16/2010,"It would be nice, if it'd start.",2,"I purchased this vehicle in January of 2007.  It ran fine for a few months but then started experiencing every problem you could imagine.  Would jolt from 1st to 2nd gear.  Electrical issues were vast.  Vehicle rarely started.  I could get up and drive it to work but then once you turn it off, it wouldn't turn back on - say if you forgot your cell at home, etc.  Was temperamental.  The air from the vents stunk like pickles."

land-rover,freelander,2002,Kate, 10/14/2009,2002 Landrover Freelander,1,"It's sad to say I must agree with all the negative reviews written. This by no means was the worst vehicle I had ever owned.  Within the first few months the sunroof went 3 times, after the 3rd time landrover replaced it, but the new one had issues too.  I stopped using the sunroof.  The driver side rear window broke 3 times.  After the 4th year of owning this vehicle hugh mechanical disasters, and finally the engine went, transmission started slipping and the diffrentials went.  I would never reccommend landrover products to anyone, waste of money and time.  Landrover should pay the customers to driver the vehicle."
land-rover,freelander,2002,Jake, 06/04/2010,A Terrible Car,1,"This is a terrible car! One month after I bought it the timing belt breaks and I spend $ 500 getting a new one put in. The next month, the motor needs to be checked again,  another $600 bucks spent on it! I was driving it in manual one day and the transmission loses all gears except for park and neutral. And I was on the interstate at rush hour, the car gets towed overnight because the tow truck won't bring it to my house, Land Rover wants me to spend $1000 bucks getting the tranny rebuilt, the Hyundai dealer where I bought it said to just sell it which I did to my brother for $200 because he would fix it someday. Bad SUV for anybody."
land-rover,freelander,2002,devynsdad, 08/27/2005,Nice little ride,4,"I had a 2002 Freelander for about a year and a half before we had a third child and traded up to a Discovery.  In the time I had it I had one problem with the coolant hose popping, but I was just pulling into my driveway when it happened, so no biggy.  We made three 1000+ mile roundtrips in the Freelander, and had no problems at all.  In a sea of Escapes, Libertys' Rav4s and CRVs the Freelander is a very sweet little alternative.  Plus Land Rover dealerships treat everyone so much better than other makes it's amazing."

This car has been nothing but problems since day 1.  Service people not friendly and overcharge you on everything.  Dealerships all very far away unless you live in a bigger city.  Engine went out at 50,000 miles, right after lease bought out and warranty up conveniently.  Brakes suddenly went out with no warning and ruined the rotors right away.  Heater never worked right and sunroof broken.  NEVER AGAIN will I step foot on a Land Rover lot or recommend them to someone else.  I wouldn't want someone else to be stuck like us.  Run away fast!!"
land-rover,freelander,2002,PeterJ4, 05/05/2006,A total lemon,2,"Leasing this car has been an absolute nightmare! From the brakes to the electronics, from the sunroof to the stereo, everything on my vehicle has needed to be repaired. LR North America rushed this vehicle to market and consumers have paid the price. Totals lemons! Land Rover could learn a lot from Honda about customer service and customer retention. Would- be Land Rover owners, BEWARE! My warranty just expired and LR refuses to fix my defective sunroof even though this is known to be a common defect."
land-rover,freelander,2002,Kenneth, 06/14/2006,The worst SUV on the road,1,"Ive never had a car with this much problems. It has been in ths shop 6 time in less than 2 years. First time the check engine light came on it was still under warranty. Then the cooling system went haywire. It took three times for the dealer figured out what the problem was. After repacing the hoses, cooling fan and then finally the water pump. Then the brakes wear out unusally fast tearing into the rotors, twice in less than 18 months. Then the sunroof clatters. The back door won't open it needed the motor replaced. Then finally with less than 75k the Transmisson went out the whole thing needed to be replaced. "

I have had this vehicle for less than a year and it has been the worst car I have ever owned.  The vehicle has been in the shop 7 times in 9 months and the transmission was rebuilt completely.  How can a car with 33,000 miles ever have transmission problems.  The service engine light comes on pretty much every month and the techs at LandRover never seem to understand why.

Must have a truck that I can get my scooter out of easily. I am not going to give my truck away. Understand that. It's still a LandRover.

The nice sales people and no stress atmosphere is what out me over the edge in getting the Freelander.  No hassles.  I know another satisfied customer as well who has had one longer.

We are now told that because the Freelander is no longer in production, the engine will be 'very difficult' to find and may take a month or so to locate... then Land Rover tells us that they will not pay for a new engine but will give us a $4500 ""credit"" towards buying a new Land Rover!

rule it out until I drove it. During 
the test drive I realized that the 
people leaving the bad reviews must 
never have driven one. The second I 
put the car in drive, I was in love. 
Ford, Mazda and Jeep should not even 
be in the same class. There is no way

So you can assume exactly what kind of ownership experience my family and I had to endure for over 5 years. When the motor finally dies at 58Kmiles, and the transmission had been slipping for 1 year, the car still smelled brand new when it was sold for scrap parts. Never ever buy a Freelander, unless you have a high tolerance for a cheaply built, outsourced funky japanese tranny and a Chiness built motor with epoxy glue holding the cylinder sleeves together.

I have replaced the engine, transmission, heater core, thermostat, exhaust plenum, rear window actuator (twice) and have had my car in the shop longer than I've been able to drive it! Land Rover will not take responsibility for this mistake of a vehicle. I was told the engine broke because the valves bent. They built the engine with ""Interference valves"" meaning they do interfere. If they are slightly off, the pistons will smash into them, causing them to brake- causing you to need a new engine. I only have 60,000 miles on mine and have spen more repairing it than I owe on it. Does anyone know of any class action lawsuits? Because I am on board. "

is a little expensive for whats its 
worth, considering a little more will 
buy u a Discovery...I tested this car

have taken it to many ski trips. If you 
are even thinking of comparing this to 
a Jeep or even toyota, you are

land-rover,freelander,2002,Kent Cys, 05/22/2002,Freelander Rules!,4,"And the rules are:

1.  Step up to the SE or HSE, 
especially the HSE for the sumptuous 
leather if you have the $$.

2.  Make sure your SE comes with a 
Sunroof, Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade, 
and Heated Seats (All standard on HSE).

3.  Dip your head and slide legs first 
across the front seats if you are 
taller than 5'8"" -- Freelander has 
LR's standard Command Seating position.

4.  Enjoy!  Liberty and Escape V6 
owners may dust you in a race.  But 
bumps that make their vehicles shake 
like Strom Thurmond covered in fire 
ants will hardly affect Freelander."
land-rover,freelander,2002,Dan_Keeney, 03/31/2009,Watch out when they reach high miles,3,"I had very good luck with the Freelander until I approached 75,000 miles. I had always followed the textbook in terms of maintenance, but faced a major problem requiring a replacement of the head gaskets, which would have cost $4,500. The vehicle wasn't worth that much on trade, so I got rid of it. The service tech told me that the '02 Freelander engine was over-engineered because they wanted more power for the American market than provided by the 4-cylinder version that had been used successfully for years in Europe. I also had constant problems with the sunroof as well, but otherwise it was a great vehicle until the engine went. Just get a complete diagnostic before buying at high miles."

At 35K Miles the Engine needed replacement and now at 73K Miles the Transmission is slipping and needs replacement.  Radio is shot.  Sunroof was replaced twice.  Brakes AND Roters wear easily.  Maintanance is costly.  Would not recommend buying any of the Landrover vehicles after their latest Consumer Report Reviews.

land-rover,freelander,2002,Never Again, 05/30/2009,Disaster on wheels,2,"I purchased the 2002 Freelander S several years ago. Within the first year I spent over $5,600 in electrical, engine, and exhaust parts - that doesn't include labor costs.  The rear door window and wiper broke ($500), front passenger lock malfunctioned ($300), my entire dash had to be replaced because the coolant system was spilling fluid into the dash ($2800), and the exhaust system went ($2000).  The Freelander depreciates in value by $2500-3000 per year. Highway and city mileage is dismal. Blue book value is only $6,000 right now.  I cannot wait to get rid of this vehicle. I cannot emphasize enough what a horrible decision is was purchasing the Freelander. "
land-rover,freelander,2002,j2thaw3, 06/22/2009,Lucky to Free myself from this trouble,2,"I bought my Freelander from Honda used vehicles with 1 previous owner, and all the maintenance records.  I assumed it was a great deal at the time.  WOW, after spending about what I owed on it to ""attempt"" to fix it, it still didn't work.  The last shop I took it to said, ""Get rid of it anyway you can, there are 7 major engine malfunctions.""  All this after spending the money to maintenance it regularly.  I would up trading it in for half of what I owed on it.  This vehicle was a nightmare that I don't wish upon anybody!"
land-rover,freelander,2002,Chai, 06/05/2002,First Impressions,4,"My wife and I happened upon the 
Freelander in the 2002 Vancouver Auto 
Show.

The deal clincher occured when we test-
drove through a demanding off-road 
track - it blew the other mini-SUV 
competition (RAV4, CRV, Escape) away. 
Then the on-road handling was also 
extremely impressive, hugging the road 
on fairly tight turns (although not as 
good as the Audi A4 or BMW 325i but 
better than the mini-SUV competition).

The ride is quiet and very comfortable.

We did ourselves a favour and got the 
wood trim, which greatly improved the 
appearence of the dash.

for a month."

The price of their timing belt replacement on the freelander is $2000, this is insane. Four people in my family have owned landrover's and realized it was a terrible vehicle and some have gotten rid of them and other's are trying to get rid of them.

When I finally got the car back, one of the rear windows wouldn't go up. Driving 3 hrs to the nearest dealership in Grand Rapids, MI, the engine seized. The dealership told me they had to call the factory in Europe to confirm that a head gasket had gone. In the last couple years, I've had the sunroof fixed 3 times, window motors replaced, speakers replaced & the air conditioner has NEVER worked. Now, at 60,000 miles, BOTH head gaskets have gone.

Recently the transmission lost 2nd gear (just skips right over it now) and the sunroof won't open, and the AC just died. However this Freelander was the first one sold in my state and has had a heck of a great run. Currently with 224,550 miles on it (not a typo), I refuse to put money into it at this stage in its life, so I guess its time to part.  After reading everyone's issues with this Land Rover model, I feel like I should fix it up and sell it to the Land Rover museum."

solved a major problem that I had! Most 
4x'4's you have to shift into 4 wheel 
drive mode. When you do not use it much 
the gera get dried out and it stops 
working right! With this it is full

problem is sloved!"
land-rover,freelander,2002,SCRUM HALF, 06/14/2002,"So far, so very good!",4,"This car is everything I wanted in a

complaints. First, watch your head when 
you get in. I have to remember to duck. 
Second, the driver's seat is fixed in 
vertical position. There is not much 
extra head room once you are in, and 
the rear-view mirror blocks a large 
portion of your outside field-of-view. 
Takes some getting used to. That said, 
the Freelander's on-road handling is 
superb. It drives like a sports car, 
and it seems to have plenty of power 
for my needs, even fully loaded with 
the family. It cost a little more than 
I wanted to spend, but I definitely

more than comparably-equipped Escape or 
Liberty but with features neither of them had, 
like traction control, steptronic transmission,  
and hill descent control. 

On road handling is simply awesome - this 
thing feels like a European sports car.  Off 
road, it still feels like a mountain goat.  I also 
love the quirky interior layout.  It is 
refreshingly different from other vehicles on

in a parking garage. Dollar for dollar 
the Freelander makes the most financial 
sense... It drives like a passenger 
car, has the off-road capability of its 
brothers and can handle a family of 
four with all the gear accordingly.... 
additionally, aside from the service 
you can expect to find associated with 
the Land Rover name it is always nice

It is annoying and if I hadn't already taken the car off road and loved how it

low and the engine VERY quiet. The 
Rover dealer was the best too. 
No ""vultures"" swarming you as you exit

It's traction is superb in slick 
conditions. We've been off-road a few 
times and our Freelander surprised 
every time with its electrifying

already excellent seat comfort by 
installing third-party armrest (found

go offroad, not to have tons of space for

If you want the former buy a minivan.  The 
Freelander rides the road like it has 
magnets for tires.  When it is raining, it feels 
like the pavement is dry.  The build quality is 
outstanding.  Some people have been 
negative about the interior design.  
However, plain it may be, it will last and take 
a beating.  The leather seats are amazing.

in my hands causing the other windows 
to open/close on their own and act 
wacky. The good news is that the 
dealer, after calling on my cell phone 
fixed it almost on the spot when I 
drove in. It was COLD with a window

vehicle as a daily driver. That was
until Land Rover invited us to a free
off-road school. In case you didn't
already know, buying a Land Rover makes
you a member of their club. After a full
day of driving the off road vehicle park
in Hollister, CA we came to the
conclusion that the Freelander is not a
car nor a truck but a real 4x4 off road
vehicle. Without any prior off road
experience our group drove our stock
Freelanders over black diamond trails
with minimal coaching from our
instructors. Even veteran off-roaders
stopped and got out there cameras as we
traversed some extreme terrain. Best
quote of the day: ""WOW!"""

the Range Rover, it's incredibly and

gets far better gas mileage than 
expected. I get 27mpg on the highway

few electrical problems with the

Just returned from another trip to the New England mountains in the winter. The Freelander is an all- weather vehicle that feels safe in all conditions as long as the tires are new or relatively little worn. Would not try to climb any rocks with this little SUV, but any kind of mud, snow or even shallow water is no obstacle. Strongly recommend rubber floor mats, trunk plastic cover and covers for seats. The vehicle has its problems with quality of manufacturing/reliability (numerous problems were minor, only one left it immobile for a prolonged period due to a problem with delivery of a specific spare part)."

most forein cars this SUV runs best at 
higher RPM's. Lack of power, was caused 
by my driving habits. I use the sport

I need.  We have taken trails rated for 
advanced or expert drivers, it never 
skips a beat. Last winter we were 
driving over Rabbit Ears pass by 
Steamboat they closed the pass while we 
were going over. We cruised right 
through.  If fuel economy is is your

comfort. We have had only a couple
electrical problems with the seatbelt

I have spent over $15,000.00 in repairs on the vehicle and there is no end in sight as to repairs that are still to come. The average repair done by the dealership cost upwards of $500.00. I have never got out of the dealership with a bill less than $500.00 and that was for replacing a small coolant hose that one day just exploded into several hundred pieces.

We have had no problems with the brakes so far (I put 10K since buying it used).  The parts replaced so far though (under warranty at no cost) have been the rear window switch, driver's door lock, thermostat, coolant reservoir.  Without a warranty that is $1200 worth of work.  I like the fact that this SUV is faster and more fun than our CRV, but the gas mileage pales in comparison (I get 18-20).  When the extended warranty runs out, I'll sell this car.

I would recommend this car as long as there is a dealer close by.  I do love the thing though and I have had other SUVs before and this one is by far my favorite.
land-rover,freelander,2002,Burn2, 03/24/2005,Happy with my 2002 Freelander,4,"Bought a loaner vehicle with 9,000 miles, so expected some minor cosmetic problems - only thing was the dash-mounted drink holder; replaced, no problem.  Now have put 20,000 miles on vehicle and only problem I've had was the transmission, replaced under warranty.  Amusing since this is a BMW-sourced item, and not a Land Rover part.  Other than that no reliability issues.  The dealer (North Point, Alpharetta) has been very good, no complaints with their service.  Gas mileage is as expected, 17 mpg all city driving.  In the real world the power is just fine for merge into highway traffic, take left turns on busy roads etc.  Feels solid without typical SUV porkiness, comfortable ride.  "

land-rover,freelander,2002,madin TX, 07/13/2006,mad in Texas,2,"I loved my Freelander until my first experience with the Rover dealership. I paid over $300 for the 45,000 miles checkup.They told me there was nothing wrong with the transmission.  Now that I am out of warranty at 50,000 miles I am having problems. I called them and told them that my brake lights just stopped working and I have to go out of town and I needed to get them fixed asap. They told me it would cost me $125.00 and they could not get to it for four days!  My husband paid $17.83 for the brake light swtich and fixed it in less than five minutes."
land-rover,freelander,2002,Jaybird, 08/10/2006,What are the complaints about?,4,"I have had this vehicle for about a month now and am very impressed with it. I am averaging 23 mpg and no mechanical problems. I have read many negative reviews about this vehicle and have figured out why. First, this is not a sports car. I can see why people have to have engines replaced. The engine requires synthetic oil only. It has enough power to do the job but can see people flooring it all the time because it ""just isn't enough"" and that takes it toll on an engine, as is also true for the transmission. The brakes are disc- front/drum back so you cannot stand on the brakes all the time and not expect to replace pads very often. It's a luxury SUV treat it good, it will reciprocate."
land-rover,freelander,2002,D, 08/30/2006,Freeloader not Freelander,2,"Felt like a solid vehicle initially, but it all went down hill real quick. Poor quality and no reliability.

Land Rover's are a high end SUV.  You can't stop at the local quick lube and the get oil changed, they don't have a filter to fit it.  They cost a ton to keep up, electrical problems, tranny problems, over heating problems.  If you buy this SUV, you are going to have problems with it.  Is it worth it for you to drive a Land Rover?

Too many electrical and engine problems and now there appears to be a transmission issue with this car although we have kept up with the maintenance.  Additionally, the dealership is NOT owned by Land Rover and they are less than helpful.

The AC is a little on the anemic side, but I knew that when I bought it - besides it's an open windows type of truck. This is not a luxury SUV, if that's what you want, look at an Acura or Lexus. It's a funky small SUV that will get you thru any bad weather conditions. I have never had the truck break down, fail to start, overheat, etc. It has made funky noises, odd warning lights, and burned out lights on occasion. I am thinking of replacing it with an LR2 simply because I would like a little more acceleration and I really like the flame orange color."

LR will do nothing for victims like me (estimated $10,000 or so loss in ""value"" from one day to next, as I now hold nothing but an engineless shell).  Strongly recommend against Land Rover due to poor quality."

At 67,488 miles, I had a manifold issue that (luckily) was replaced under the CA emissions warranty, or I would have paid $1700 (almost broke down). Now, at 70, 777 miles, my timing belt busted (broke down on side of road) and Land Rover is saying that, despite their scheduled maintenance at 72,000 when they replace the belt, it's my problem - regardless of the fact the belt busted before the company- mandated replacement mileage.  Two tow- truck drivers have told me that they love people who own these cars. They make their biggest profits off Land Rover owners. Do not waste your money."

So all in all I lost $6000 by owning this vehicle for a little over 1yr.

I also thought the Freelander was handsome, and unique among all the RAV4's and CR-V's. The gas mileage for a small ute was appalling. Some niggling problems with LR, even covered under warranty, were an inconvenience. $100 oil changes made me sick-a workaday Rover 2.5 V-6 really needs synthetic oil from new?

A very solid vehicle with a quiet engine, good acceleration, and plenty of room for four. The cargo space is fine with the rear seats folded forward.

land-rover,freelander,2002,ducati, 03/22/2002,The driver's choice,4,"We compared the LR to the Jeep Liberty, Mazda Tribute, Honda CRV, Ford Escape, and Audi A4 Avant quattro.  Out of those choices, only the Land Rover had excellent on-road manners (approaching that of a sport sedan) and off-road capability.  It is truly an excellent blend for the real world user.  I do think the dash is a bit ugly, but the quality of the leather (HSE) is 10 steps above the crap offered in the Liberty.  For only a few more $$ than Liberty, and with 4.9% financing (3.9% for cloth S), this is the vehicle to own for those who like to drive.  Interestingly enough, as we got down to our last drives, the Audi A4 Avant quattro was really the only competitor.."

land-rover,freelander,2002,joe, 04/28/2008,Fun to drive,4,Great car unfortunately you better have the wallet to pay for the costly and often repairs. 550 dollars air sensor went out that helps determine the amount of air to let into the engine. This caused the SUV to be unable to even start. Was very fun to drive and turned a lot of heads at my high school. Due to bad weather and my inexperience as a driver it was totaled in a high speed rollover. Very safe car however I walked off with zero injuries and the car held its frame perfectly! Its high mileage and broken axle/wheel rods ended up making it cheaper to totaled. Fun car though

land-rover,freelander,2002,supereks, 08/18/2019,"Nice drive, when not being repaired",3,"Owed it from 2001 to 2011, first 7 years in RI, then NYC.

Did not handle the RI snow like the Audi quattro A4 that I had at the same time. But did feel quite solid on the road, almost like a little tank. Handled quite well for a small SUV, was a pleasure to drive. I almost felt that BMW had designed a little race car; that is how it felt driving on dry roads sometimes (BMW owned LR while the Freelander was being designed, I think).

But, boy, did it have PROBLEMS. One winter it spent almost the whole winter in the shop getting fixed, while I was driving a rental paid by Land Rover.  I think that was for the broken engine ignition, this required all the keys and ignition/fuel cap to be replaced and it took 1-2 months for the replacements to arrive from England.

Then the rubber seal of the rear window leaked and had to be replaced when rainwater accumulated in the car.

One day the engine lost much of its power and banging was heard, 2/6 cylinders had somehow failed. Drove it slowly and carefully to LR for repairs and it stayed there for a while.

I was constantly worried that the rear door window lowering mechanism would fail (it did have hiccups at times), which then basically prevented us from opening the tail door, but it never permanently failed.

The fuel gauge seemed to get stuck at half in the beginning, so I would tank up the car every time it approached half, because after that it just stayed at half. This somehow spontaneously fixed itself after about a year. Or maybe LR fixed it w/o telling me in one of my many trips to their shop. I do not think I told them about this relatively tiny problem with all the other more serious ones they were working on. I already felt like a pest. I think the LR service chief was embarrassed every time I came, each time there was some serious issue after another to be addressed.

One of there rear brakes was ""stuck"" after release of the hand brake. They had to replace something.

Something was banging in one of the front wheels after about one year and this required some replacement too, but was fine after.

Cannot recall all the problems in detail, but I was so many times in that LR dealership in RI, it was ridiculous, I tried out all the loaners, I think, and went through all the Enterprise rental cars they had there, while mine was getting fixed. There was just one problem after another. All repair were under warranty in that period.

With that experience I got an extended warranty and put it to good use.

The transmission always felt a little ""sticky"" between 3rd and 4th gear, from the beginning, I mentioned this to LR during one of my frequent visits there, and I think they said something about having it ""reprogrammed"" (if I recall correctly), but the problem persisted. Some 30-40K miles later it became worse and when they did the transmission fluid change at 60K miles as part of the regular maintenance (the vehicle was at that point out of regular and extended warranty) I picked the vehicle up and drove it home with the transmission basically barely shifting. I called LR at that point to complain to them that they broke something and their response was that I need a new transmission for 7k. I later read that a lot of people had similar problems after such ""routine maintenance"" with transmission fluid change, and had I known this I would never have taken the Freelander to LR for maintenance out of warrantly. Got the transmission changed when it completely failed 100 miles later for another used transmission at an outside shop  and if was fine, until I rear-ended another vehicle and decided not to spend 5-7K to repair a vehicle that was worth only 3K before the accident. Donated it and got 500 dollars for tax deduction.

All in all, it was fun when it drove. It never left me stranded, probably because I would notice something different about the sound of the engine and had it
 checked and repaired before anything worse happened.

Oh, almost forgot: it did not have an electronic stabilization program and this cost us almost dearly one day in snowy Vermont. I was driving with about an inch of snow on the road, got over a small hill after which there was a bend in the road, and suddenly the rear end was going sideways, but fortunately there was no one else on the road, the rear end hit the pile of snow at the side of the road and the vehicle soon came to a stop. I learned to appreciate the ESP in the Audi A4 quattro when it kicked in a few times in similar situations, you barely felt anything going on, the vehicle just indicated that ESP came on and continued straight as an arrow. I learned to be very careful when on slippery roads in the Freelande!

There are some things that could have been built with a little more quality just like about anything else on the market. This is a European vehice, not a Ford, GM, or anything else people expect to change the oil every 25K miles and run it to death. It takes a certain amount of care and maintenence.

Everyone on here must not know how to maintain a vehicle because even after buying mine used with 58,000 miles, I haven't had any unexpected problems. People need to understand that this is a foreign, luxury SUV and requires more driver knowledge. You can't just put gas in it and expect it to maintain itself. I check the fluids every other week and change the oil every 3000 miles. Gas mileage is decent for an SUV of this age. Yes, parts are a bit more expensive but this is expected with any foreign vehicle. Personally, I think this is a safe, fun, and reliable vehicle that I am very proud to own."

Passengers in the back seat suffer. Seats at near 90 degree angles, and are hard as concrete. Not good for people who grocery-shop with the family, as the cargo area doesn't have enough room for two weeks worth of meals. I've noticed lately that the back hatch is having trouble as well.

Trouble with engine, tranny, door speakers, brakes, antenna breaks often, hard top rattles, soft top a pain in the neck/plastic windows haze, engine has no oomf, wide turning radius, dated interior/controls, poor instrument lighting, need a key for gas- cap, dealer not helpful. Never buy again!  Afraid to drive far from home."

land-rover,freelander,2003,Mike, 10/17/2006,Good for what it is,4,"I purchased the SE3 for my wife about a year ago.  So far we have not had any real problems.  The front brakes had a dragging problem but the dealership corrected the problem.  The detachable top is great, my wife loves stripping it down for the carolina summer.  The traction control works GREAT in snow and ice, we go to the mountains on the weekends and the freelander goes through the snow as well as my truck (and that is saying something).  The interior is easy to clean and works well with the jeep like feel.  All in all a great car for the wife and a fun car to drive."
land-rover,freelander,2003,AKfreelander, 12/27/2006,Class Action Suit anyone?!,2,"Bought the Freelander (FL) in 03, and, loved it.  As you can see from the other reviews, great car when it's not in the shop.  Went to the dealership for all service, oil changes, etc.  Six months ago, I started having overheating problems.  Dealer changed out the coolant tank, etc.  Kept having the problem over and over until two weeks ago when the car would not start.  Towed it into the dealer, needs a new engine.  $8400 estimate.  Do the research!  This car is a lemon.  The engine will blow out ~65K, good luck talking to LR if you are out of warranty.  It's a money black hole."
land-rover,freelander,2003,Sarah, 10/01/2009,Warning to all...,2,"I bought my car in 2005 and it was under warranty until 2008. While under warranty, they had to replace 2 window motors, the sunroof motor, a fuel valve and eventually they put a rebuilt engine in this money pit!  Fortunately, I did not have to pay for any of that-I just spend endless hours/days at the dealer. I should have been forwarned. In the past month (mind you I am 8 months pregnant)it's left me stranded on the highway twice. Battery was the first cause (ok, batteries need to be replaced) but 1 week later, here I am stranded without a car again (it died while driving and I'm waiting on the problem this time.) I am furious and WILL NEVER BUY any sort of Land Rover product again!!"

This car drives like my son's BMW three series on the road, and better than my old Hummer off road. People trip when they see this car; which is its only down side. There's constantly finger prints on my windows. The seats are really comfortable, even on a straight through 1,000 mile road trip. It handles great in all weather, and like a dream in the rockies. Only minor complaints for this car like the cupholder, but nothing to cry about. I've only had to bring it in to the dealer for the oil change."

towards the end of my relationship with the car however (aprox. 74,000 miles), engine lights began coming on due to an ABS sensor which costs $540 dollars for just the part itself! 
I also have read that these cars dont usually last much longer after 100,000 miles. 
my suggestion is to obviously buy this car with low miles in order to have an awesome car experience."

First, I had to have the ball bearing replaced (under warranty $3,000).  Then the engine ran hot 3x's, each time the coolant had run out and had to be replaced. The 4th time I had to take it in due to the coolant again, it turned out that I needed a new engine! Thank God for warranties ($7,000).  Now it's in the shop again because the gasket needs replacing.  I spoke with a Land Rover mechanic that told me to get rid of it.  He also said that there have been several problems with the Freelander in general. Further, he said that I will continue to have problems that are expensive if I keep it. "
land-rover,freelander,2003,uscarbuyer, 07/02/2008,I'm buying American!,2,"My Land Rover owned me. I have never owned a vehicle that required so much maintenance. I have never off-roaded in my Land Rover, nor have I had a fender bender or accident.  I purely drive on the pavement to and from work, and in town driving to the movies, dinner, etc. My car is a southern car and has only seen snow for two weeks in the almost 5 years it has owned me.  I cannot recommend buying any Land Rover!  Anything that goes wrong you are told it is the ""British design"".  Brakes and batteries are expected to last 10-20K miles.  I cannot remember the number of recall notices, too many to count. At times the windows won't power down. I thought I would enjoy the durability. Nope. All of the cap covers & compartment covers fall off.  My drink holder spring fell out for no apparent reason.  I am not tough on my car & it is literally falling apart.  I will find plastic pieces on the floor & have no idea where they came from. I'm buying American!"

It has been in the shop the rest of the time. The place I bought it from wouldn't even deal with me. Neither would Land Rover. A trailing arm split in half, wish I could post pics, from a pot hole. The new problem is the fuel system. It was replaced a week ago and malfunctioned, leaving me stranded on the highway. I have seen the truck on a flatbed more than I have seen myself behind the wheel. I had to get AAA because I ran out of insurance tows. Oh yeah if an extended warranty is your thought, don't think it because LR nor anyone else will give you one.  "
land-rover,freelander,2003,cb, 11/25/2008,Worst purchase ever,2,"I bought my LR used with 40000 miles & thank God I bought the extended warranty! It was in the shop 18 times in 16 months-1 time it sat there for 6 months waiting for an engine that cost me 15,000 dollars! Coolant leaks coils going out window motors broken. At 44,000 miles new engine-I waited 6 mos for that one. 5 months later same problem- I needed another new engine! Out of my 18 trips to the dealer 15 were the same engine problems. The dealer bought it back as a lemon. Oh yeah-it was towed 7 of the 18 times because it didn't run. Never again will I buy a LR. Buyer beware-you will have problems!"

The fuel pump went, upper air intake needed replaced and it too leaked coolant into the oil causing me to need a new engine.  All in a 7 month period.  The Land Rover dealer told me these cars are unreliable and they have this problem at least once a month.  He told me to get rid of it because I will only have more problems.

This car turned evil out of nowhere. There is a defect in the cooling system that should have been recalled and can't be fixed. I was stuck without a car for nearly 2mnths because of this devil. Had no choice but to have it repoed, because the cost of repair is equal to what I owe...not that it can be fixed anyways! Took it to 4 different foreign shops and they don't want anything to do with it. Now I'm stuck having to file bankruptcy over this mess. I would hate to see anyone go through this, wish I would of done some research before buying Land Rover."

The only problem i had with the car was a big warranty issue- nobody wanted to warranty because the price of parts is high, that is what i have heard, however i never had any problems with parts or the way it ran.

It's kinda loud, when you drive.  As soon as the warranty expired at 50,000 within a month I needed a new g filter $500 Landrover would do nothing.  And now at 70,000 I was loosing coolant car will not start.  Apparantly like everyone else I need an engine.  I called Landrover the day it would not start, they acted like they had no clue why.  Once I got on here I know they know what's wrong with it they are just trying to get me to tow it there so they can charge me an arm and a leg to fix it."

With regular maintenance and checking of the fluids we have not had a bit of problems with it. Remember to check the water monthly, it runs quite abit hotter than the normal American Brands.  We have not had any problems with ours it currently has 84,000 miles on it, and no major problems besides regular maintenance. Note that Land rover did Recall the fuel module and a stop light sensor and replaced/is required to have them replaced free of charge to us. Great Sporty little car! Ensure that dealer fully informs the buyer of the dos and donts.  Dealers like their money/mechanical fees so be sure to ask your questions before buying."
land-rover,freelander,2003,Dale Booth, 10/06/2009,A Nightmare in Sheep's Clothing,4,"Well, Where do I start - Land Rover ought to really be ashamed of the product they built.  This engine design is a total joke.  I had my Freelander approx. 1 year before I had to trade it in.  The problem was with a leak of the engine coolant into the engine.  This slow leak was unrepairable.  The only TEMPORARY solution was a new engine for a cost of $10K, according to Land Rover-Jaguar of Houston.  I had them put the SUV back together and drove it to the nearest TOYOTA dealership where I traded it for a 2005 Toyota 4Runner.  It has been happy driving ever since.   MY ADVICE TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING A NEW OR USED LAND ROVER.  DON'T DO IT; UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY FOR REPAIRS."
land-rover,freelander,2003,Mark, 12/28/2009,"Don't walk, run away",1,"We owned this vehicle for approximately 20 months.  Total cost of repairs exceeded $16,000.00.   No kidding.  The engine has inherent design flaws. The cylinder sleeves will fail, coolant will flow into the block, your motor will be shot.  You will experience electrical failures right and left.  This is the second and last product we will buy from Land Rover and Range Rover.  Utterly worthless vehicles.  Our Discovery was only marginally better.   Gulps fuel as well.  "

After the 5th month of driving it I was left stranded. The thing just completely shut down! Come to find out it was the fuel system. The thing sat at the mechanics for two months, until the part came in from the Dealer in Albuquerque. The fuel pump cost $595! The recall for the fuel system came in August so off to the Dealership we went! & they said the timing belts need replacing (cost: $1800 - it has three). The oil changes we do ourselves for $65 everytime! Or $100 if you can find a decent place that'll do it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE! Unless you like to throw away your money!"

Fabulous in snow, but bad for your wallet.  $3000 to repair massive coolant leaks, new fuel pump, ball bearing (??) needs replaced amongst other things.  Check engine light is on and vehicle is shaking and barely running.  I've only had it 2 yrs and it has 70K miles on it.  There should be a large law suit filed against Land Rover for this vehicle as it seems to have the same problems and even the Land Rover dealerships tell you it's a horrible car.

land-rover,freelander,2003,cross-country, 11/05/2003,I LOVE my freelander,5,"I purchased my Freelander in May of 
2003 and have driven from the East 
coast to the West coast and back again, 
stuffed full of possessions and a very 
drooly dog.  I found that it had 
everything I needed to deal with the 
mountains, the desert, and the cross-
country trip.  I also find it to be 
quite efficient around town.  It is 
lythe enough to handle Los Angeles 
traffic at rush hour, while being 
sturdy enough to deal with big rigs on 
the interstate."

front window heater did not work at 
first. I took it in and the fixed it. 
The ride is fun. It rides like a BMW. 
The leather seats and sunroof feels and 
look great. The Freelander is not so 
big that you can't park in a parking 
spot. It feels and drives like a large 
SUV. Being able to change the radio at 
the steerting wheel is a big plus. "

drive! the mileage is very good, handling is 
wonderful, the sound parallels the bose. It is 
fairly silent, purrs mostly.  Seats could give 
more thigh support, back could be bigger and 
most IMPORTANT: it needs some serious side 
and curtain airbags.  English ergonomics are 
fun, but not usual. Havent gotten it into snow, 
but it has gone in water pretty deep, with the 
New York rain.  Nice inner city car.  Long trips 
may be stressing due to lack of good seats."

built by scousers. I should have known 
better. 
This must have been a Friday vehicle. 
So far we're up to a new engine 
management computer, a new nav system, 
2 heads (for the stereo) and it's back 
in the shop for a problem with the 
airbags that they can't seem to 
diagnose. There have been other minor 
problems (faulty power windows etc). 
At least it's all under warranty...

If it hadn't lost 1/3 of it's value in 
12 months I'd be getting rid of it and 
going back to a BMW. As it is I'll 
probably amortise the cost over another 
year."

So far the battery had to be replaced, a vaccum hose has been replaced, the heater core went and when fixing that the vaccum motor had to be replaced. I am now on my 3rd radio due to problems with the radio or GPS. And my new problem is the lighter has quit working. Of course this has all been covered by warranty but should all this be wrong with a new car and an inconvience to me as I had to keep taking the vehicle to the dealership until my husband bought the LR3 so now they bring me a loaner and pick mine up. I really like the design of the vehicle but service was not good until we became a 2 Landrover Household."

buying and I found the Editor Reviews 
to be rather misleading. There is a 
great case to be made for the 
Freelander over the BMW, namely price. 
Sure it does not have all the extra 
bells and whistles offered by the 
luxury SUV but then this is not a 
luxury SUV, it is an Off-road vehicle 
that has been designed to handle well 
on the roads. The sport-shift is 
especially useful in snow/ice 
conditions as it allows the vehicle to 
be driven around town with minimal use 
of the breaks (helps prevent loss of 
traction). All round this is a great 
car."

After 2 years we had to replace 3 sets of brakes (every 17000 miles) the heater core, the thermostat, the antifreeze bottle and cap, the rear window, the moonroof,and to top it all off the engine. Although it was all under warranty, we were treated as second class citizens by not only the service department of our dealer, but by the land rover north america corporate offices as well. We find ourselves just waiting for the next thing to break. A friend that works in the service dept. Confided that the freelander is a nightmare to most who own it. Getting a lexus rx300 tomarrow.

all wheel drive vehicles, the superb on-
road handling and true off-road 
capability convinced me that the 
Freelander was really the best of both 
worlds.  It is fun to drive, reasonably 
economical (especially for an SUV), and 
mine has not yet gotten stuck in mud or

I came to find out from other freelander owners that the brakes tend to heat up fast and then it set off your traction control warning. it tends to create more of a problem in the summer.The gas mileage for an suv this size is not the greatest.one of the biggest problems is you can only get the filter from a landrover dealer you just cant take it to the nearest jiffy lube to have your oil changed.it  also doesnt have alot of room for car seats .

However, since buying (new) we've had all 5 window regulators replaced, the sunroof twice, all 4 brake rotors warped and had to be replaced, and most recently the car quit completely, with 6 different error codes in the computer, most notably that the camshaft position sensor had failed.  The dealer treats us like poor cousins to the LR3 and Range Rover owners and we can't get a loaner, even for the latest issue.

it should be.  After riding all three, 
the Freelander feel much more solid 
and designed for much more aggressive 
off road experiences while really 
giving off a ""European"" feel while on 
the black top. Weighing in at 4500lbs 
due to all the steel reinforcements, 
it can use a little more HP, but it 
still has a little punch 
accelerating.  The interior is all 
business but still has a conservative 
upper class feel.  All in all the 2003 
model gives much more SUV than others 
in its class and brings with it the 
prestige of Land Rover."

However, I was pleasantly surprised 
when we started filling up the back.  
There is a lot more room than you

Concerns about storage and on-dash 
cupholders are BS.  I've take a couple

limited seat travel and no height

All within 1 mo. of buying this. Then recall: Brake Light Switch Replacement Recall Action P004. Which came after 6mos of me owning this. Then 2/19/08 my engine over heated.

There are some annoying design flaws. The flimsy cup holder is in a place prime for constantly spilling. The steering wheel isn't perfectly centered and the back door opens into the curb instead of away from it. The seats should move electrically for a luxury line, but they are manual.

I've had this thing for 4 years and at 52000 miles I've had very few problems. I think you here more from people that do than from people that don't and I think this FL is getting a bad rap. It's a european vehicle not a chevy or a ford. It takes a little more care and driver knowledge than US cars for sure. Knowing how to drive and what to listen for mostly. I'll admit there are apparently some inferior parts in some of these trucks and it doesn't sound like Land Rover NA is concerned at all about consumer relations.

Coolant leak even after the dealership fixed twice.  Extremely high maintenance cost for a SUV/car that costs only mid $20K. When we purchased the Freelander, dealer was rude since it was the cheapest model out of all the LR models. The value depreciates quickly.  After having it for 4 years, I finally sold it.  "

20,000 miles, not one mechanical issue. 
The cargo room is small, but will 
suffice for runs to the hardware, 
hauling one piece of furniture, or a 
trip for four who pack light. I would 
buy this car again without question."

in Clearwater on 5/15/03.  Great 
dealer.  John the salesman is 
excellent.  I went from a Ford 
Harley F150 to this so I lost some 
features I was used to (not to mention 
power) that should be on this SUV for 
it's price tag.  Such as auto lights, 
keyless entry and a better sound system 
(Harmon Kardon is not very good despite 
what people think).  However, I love 
this and don't miss my truck at all.  
It is a little small (I'm 6'1) but 
still comfortable.  People complain 
about the power but I thinks it pretty 
quick.  It does shift a bit hard."

offroad, but if you aren't going to 
take it there, it isn't really worth

for someone who wants storage, wants 
offroading, wants comfort, and wants

wheel drive failed and when the dealer 
hooked my car to its computer it gave 
the wrong readings. After calling 
Rover about these problems they say 
the dealer will fix them. I can't go 
to the dealer regularly to fix 
these ""small mechanical problems."" The

The down side has been since my purchase I have had to replace my brakes twice, averaging every 16,000 miles!  Although covered under warranty, I had to replace the fuel pump, had the car towed to the dealership, upon pick-up, I was horrified to find that my SUV had sustained body damage while at the dealership!  Currently, it has overheated three times!  After reading previous reviews, and escalating fuel costs, I'm TOTALLY convinced on a Hybrid! "

A few months ago I've notice that the fuel consumption was higher than normal. I took it to the Lad Rover Dealer and they said it was the fuel pump. For my surprise, I did not have to pay for anything, since it was a recall. If you drive a 2004 Freelander, take it to the dealer to get the fuel pump replaced. I also noticed that after the fix, the gear changes are more smooth. "
land-rover,freelander,2004,azetterm1, 04/09/2010,Mine is ok,3,"After reading a lot of negative reviews on-line about the Freelander I decided to purchase one anyway, figuring that most people that wright reviews do so because they have had a problem.  I was right, I have had my Land Rover for 6 months now with no problems except a dead battery, which is normal after 6 years.  I checked the carfax report before I purchased the vehicle and there were no issues in the past.  Some common problems that I read online were brake issues, thou I have not had any problems I upgraded the brakes anyway just to be on the safe side. Brakes warp because of heat, so I added slotted brake rotors which improve ventilation and ceramic pads which create less heat and dust."

It is very reliable, I have never spent less on repairs, looks great. The AWD works extremely well in Snow and I feel very safe in all weather conditions - which is important with my kids in the vehicle. Maybe some Freelander's are lemons but mine is a GEM. The other good thing about this vehicle is that it is unique - not a lot of others on the road. Excellent handling and performance. "

land-rover,freelander,2004,surreyman, 10/29/2010,rotten rover,3,"Purchased in 2007 this 2004 model had done only 15,000 miles. The first thing to go wrong was a fuel pump at 15,500 miles. The lr dealer did not want to know neither did lr head office. Then the window regulators went within weeks in the back. Finally, having serviced the car every six months and at 35,000 miles the turbo went. The workshop said I should use an lr new turbo due to the quality so I laughed and said I had had it with lr quality. I found an independent shop reconditioning turbos and got one for another workshop to fit. That's $2500 instead of $3300 at the dealers. So about half the car value retail and close to trade in prices."

land-rover,freelander,2004,wildcats_fan, 12/18/2014,Worst Car Ever Seriously!!!!!!!,1,After owning one and spending thousands I couldn't begin to describe how bad these Freelander's actually are. If you read this and think your getting a good deal on one then take my advice and run.. It's a known fact that they are a ticking time bomb. I waisted thousands on it and never once felt as if I were going to make it to the next destination without it breaking down. If you really want to know how bad it really was... 17 trips to Landrover and that was under Waranty. After the warranty expired I spent about seven thousand on it at local repair shops and it was literally falling apart the day I traded it off. I was one of the lucky ones and actually got rid of it before it blew up....
land-rover,freelander,2004,philashe, 03/16/2011,Horrible reliability,3,"Bought the car at 63,000 miles. Donated the car to charity at 67,000 miles. Drove for 4,000 miles until oil cooler and transmission cooler failed within a week of each other. 

After the failures the car needed major engine and transmission work, estimated to be around $9000 to repair. This was after a $4000 service. Car cost $1 per mile in repairs on top of the regular expenses you expect (fuel, regular maintenance, insurance). 

Most third-party shops are unable to work on the vehicle, requiring trips to the dealer. Insurers consider this a luxury car and the premiums are very high.

Very expensive car to try to keep running. Buy a bus pass and good walking shoes. You'll be left stranded."
land-rover,freelander,2004,Woodstock36, 04/17/2010,Nothing but a headache!!,2,"It will get you out of just about anything  weather wise. Very expensive to fix, called land rover dealer $125.00 an hour for labor, not to mention the parts. It's a great SUV if you have tons of money to sink into it. 56,000 miles, both back windows are broke, keep falling down, back door closed, never to reopen, screaming belt, hanging muffler, now to top it off, its overheating, after sitting just a few min. In 40 degree weather. I have found this situation disheartening, that they would make such a nicely designed vehicle but such poor quality. I have had many vehicles, and have never had so many things go wrong like this, I would expect these things with 100,000 miles on it, maybe even more"

I looked on line and found this to be a cronic problem. Several webite dedicated to Freelander that were lemons sonme had replaced the engine 2 or three times. All my service was done at the dealership. After the engine was replaced the car overheated again. The dealership said the headbolts needed to tightened (can't belive they had the nerve to tell me that)...I am scared to drive this car.. Do some research .. dont buy one

Aside from not having a dealer close by, there is really nothing to complain about.  My wife drives her to work everyday and she loves it.  I get to drive her on the weekends and if we go out (instead of driving my gas- guzzling Tahoe).  We have not had any serious weather, but I am looking forward to driving it in snow, possibly make a roadtrip to Colorado for that.  Basically like everyone else has said; cup holders, interior is a bit cramped, but all-in-all a great, quality vehicle that is easy at the pumps.  Also has the safety of AWD when needed.

navigation system though. I give this

It's a sporty, competent, and sharp- looking little SUV.  It rides great as a commuter, and handles off-road (in our case beach and woods) adeptly. I'd feel confident going just about anywhere in it.  We've put a decent amount of mileage on it and have had only a handful of very minor problems.  We find the car comfortable and well- designed, although it's smaller size limit it's carrying capacity. We bought a roof cargo carrier to help compensate."

If you want a realible SUV, buy a

steptronic transmission which allows 
you to shift if you want to, otherwise 
just leave it in drive and go.  There 
is also a sport option which allows for 
a more lively driving experience with 
increased engine revs.  On the road the 
suspension is great and gives a smooth 
right.  The steering is tight and 
responsive, similar to what you would 
expect in a BMW sedan.  The Freelander 
is excellent off road as well and can 
go through some rough terrain with 
aplomb.  The driving seat is excellent 
and gives a great view of the road. 
Brakes are responsive. "

This is a far superior vehicle than the

good for LR:  Fantastic sales, service 
experience, vehicle is solid, powerful, 
weighty, fast and ez to drive.  Also a 
steal with my trade.  Best rated tires 
matched to the vehicle. The 5 speed 
steptronic transmission is great.  All 
in all with its Land Rover adaptablity, 
the only downside in the mileage.  But 
oh well. Cant help but love my lil

land-rover,freelander,2004,Randall Thomas, 01/21/2006,I really like my 04 Freelander,4,"We use the Freelander as a daily driver on pavement, with only a few off-road trips. It is comfortable on long trips, delivers gas mileage in the low 20's mpg, is fun to drive, and distictive.  It is very confidence inspiring on wet and icy roads here in the mountains of Eastern KY, handles great, and is easy to park.  We have had no reliability issues and the dealer experience has been outstanding--even organizing an off-road trip in West Virginia and a free restaurant meal! I'm only sorry that Land Rover has (for now) discontinued the Freelander in the USA, giving me something of an 'orphan' feel- -kinda like how I feel about my old MG."

A coolant leak caused me to need a new engine after only 50K miles. Land Rover fought me tooth and nail over this, although they admit that this was a factory defect. It took 2 months to get a new engine (at considerable cost to me, even with the extended warranty). This is the second Land Rover that died on me. This car also ate brakes and, like many Freelanders, the sunroof broke an hour after I drove it off the lot.  This vehicle was not worth the money that I put into it.

In addition I spent countless days at the dealer (while under warranty) and became really familiar wih my mechanic and his family. I think i put his daughter thru college. This car is a money pit. EVERYTHING breaks down from the simple like the cup holder to the complex, like the transmission. I loved the car at first but towards the end I had to quit driving the car in the auto transmission mode and HAD to change the gears myself. Even then it finally failed completely. The electronic were horrible! The windows, especially the rear one; the exterior lights (all of them); the doors; the brakes; even the coolant system REGULARLY failed! I am writing this to warn those tempted by Land Rovers. They can be VERY seductive and the new ones look and drive GREAT!

I can say this however: ANYONE who buys ANY Land Rover and who is not very rich are asking for years of GRIEF!

This is all below 100k miles and no rough driving with standard maintenance. the placement of pretty much every part is insane and appears to be designed to fail and be impossible to replace.

You name it it breaks.  The cost to make repairs is astronomical"
land-rover,freelander,2005,shamfam, 12/09/2008,Junk,3,"My husband and I have had our Freelander for almost 4 years. Two weeks after we got it, it stalled leaving me and my then 1 year old stranded. That was the first engine problem. Then we had three recalls, child safety lock on passenger side door, brake light and gas cap. We have had a ticking noise for over a year and for some reason the dealership mechanics can't seem to find out what it is. Mind you this was before the warranty was up. Now after the warranty has expired, they tell us we need a new engine! We've had numerous problems! The leaking of coolant that has now leaked into the engine oil, the resevoir has been replaced among many many other things. This car is nothing but junk"
land-rover,freelander,2005,Lynne, 04/12/2008,Lemons,3,"I love my Freelander, but damn reliability sucks! Brakes and rotors $500.00 every 6 months. Oil changes $120.00. Car is a gas guzzler add another $75.00 a wk. Come on Landrover, it's a Freelander not a range Rover and a regular station won't touch them. My car had anti freeze smell from vents. They say reservoir, I say heater core cover up. Sunroof replaced 2 times. Car towed in twice once ignition switch, second coils. Strange clicking from dash sounds electrical (they cant duplicate, ""anyone have an idea?) they told me they are having a ton of problems with this vehicle and not to let my warranty runn out. I'm thinking of paying it off and selling it. Lately I sell my cars every two yrs for lemons."
land-rover,freelander,2005,bbealko, 07/08/2009,Junk,3,This vehicle is junk.  It has been a headache for my family.  The fuel pump was recalled and still doesn't work properly.  Lights on the dashboard come on and go off randomly.  My back passenger windows will not go down.  Both broke on the the same day.  Everything is so expensive to get fixed on this car.  Would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.
land-rover,freelander,2005,Mr. Collado, 11/13/2004,Unreliable,3,"The car has stalled 2 times and the

breaking and traction control and the 
dealer has been unable to fix it."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Love It, 11/03/2009,Love My Freelander,4,"I read the reviews and bought mine anyway.  It had high miles but looked brand new.  I love it!  It is fun to drive, looks great, and mine really scoots.  Gas mileage is way better highway where I get 22-24 mph.  In the city I only get about 17.  What vehicle is ever cheap to repair?  If you maintain well, the vehicle will last.  I don't take mine to a dealer,  I use Columbia Rovers.  They know their stuff.  "
land-rover,freelander,2005,miaheartless, 02/18/2012,Wow!,4,"I love my Freelander...
Great for winter weather, mountain terrain driving.
Geared low, handles amazing in snow and icy conditions.
The only repairs other than normal wear for me have been two sensors.
The most expensive repair costed less at a small shop, Walt's in Gig Harbor, WA than the regular service at Land Rover and it was for the thermostat control sensor (going on memory for title of part).
On the other hand, not the car you want for consistant high miles, highway driving.
Driving like I have to now is a waste of this vehicle.
I've taken it through some scary bad weather including road closures and that's where it excels!"
land-rover,freelander,2005,Karen C, 05/09/2008,A Rose among the Lemons?,4,"I bought my Freelander even after reading the less than stellar reviews I found on the internet.  Now I wonder if people were trying to hide something - I LOVE THIS CAR!  The handling is superb, the leather interior, heated mirrors and seats, and awesome stereo system (6 cd changer) make it a dream to drive.  I'm getting ~22 miles to a gallon - way more than posted by others.  My only beef (and it's a small one) is that I wish it had a little better pickup when pulling out.  But at highway speeds it can't be topped, and I've easily avoided several dicey situations with it's fast, accurate response.  Buy one!"
land-rover,freelander,2005,dli6990, 03/26/2008,Great car....pick carefully,4,"I love my Freelander, my favourite thing is that it's very rare. I had read about thousands and thousands of complains out there, but mine had none of them. Is not the most reliable car on earth but I love living with it. My advice is that pick a good one if you ever want to buy one, pay careful attiontion to every thing when you test drive. After you got it, check under the hood often and dun let any liquid in run below the ""min"" line(definitely dun let it run dry). I think most major problem are caused by not paying attention to your car, and the service the car as soon as the service is up."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Brocktoon, 02/15/2005,My second Freelander,4,"I traded my 2003 Freelander in on a new 2005 last month. Going with the Freelanders is the best decision I ever made when it comes to cars. Why are there so many freelander complainers? Who knows, but it's the best selling truck in Europe, and they can't be all wrong.  The 2005 is a definite improvement over the '03 in terms of looks and comfort. Don't listen to people who say this is not a capable car, I had the '03 in mud up to the doorhandles and we made it out fine. Try that in any other SUV for the price.  If you are considering purchase, yes they do require some ""care and feeding"", but check out some web enthusiast sites first and get the real story."
land-rover,freelander,2005,baradlee, 04/10/2005,Worst Car I've Ever Leased.,1,"This SUV is designed wrong, assembled wrong and just is not worth the money. And to top if off, the dealership mechanics are unskilled ans shoddy AND Land Rover could care less. 3 Sets of front brake pads & 2 sets of rotors, by 16,000 miles. Complete transmission failure(flatbed) at 26,000 miles. Thermostat leaked and was replaced at 27,000 miles. Door hinges broke, windows fell out their tracks, cupholders broke, sunroof broke. The A/C is a noisy, worthless piece of junk. Fuel Economy 13 city, 17 Hwy NO LIE! And this thing is a DOG! Can't wait to be rid of the darn thing."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Jeff Makowski, 06/10/2005,Superior versatility,4,"I'd been looking for a compromise between a full-sized SUV, for off- roading and poor weather safety, and a sedan, for better milage and handling.  The Freelander hasn't disappointed.  Very smooth ride, with little to no body roll, great visibility, superior snow/mud/muck handling, and I'm still getting relatively decent milage (18-20 mpg).  The styling certainly sets it apart from most other vehicles in it's class.  Very unique interior material (Technical Fabric), with excellent seat support and comfort. Plus, the hardtop is easily removable, looking forward to adding many summer driving miles. The Freelander is the compromise that doesn't feel like one."
land-rover,freelander,2005,disappointed, 10/26/2005,Don't even consider this vehicle,2,"I owned a 2003 Freelander and had to get rid of it. At 65K The head Gasket went. It was to Land Rover multiple times and they could NOT diagnose it. I had to personally tell them that the coolant was going into the oil because I took an oil sample. After they diagnosed the head gasket , they would not garantee the repair. The total for the repair was $2800. It ate brakes and rotors , I had electrical probs including the radio cutting out when it rained. I thought Land Rover was reputable and they would sell a reliable vehicle. I was wrong. I can go on and on . . .buying this vehicle was a MAJOR mistake."
land-rover,freelander,2005,trburton, 01/07/2007,Freelander Lemon,2,"I babied my Freelander for 55,000 miles. Not a scratch. Never replaced Rotors & replaced pads only once. Loved the handling & snow traction (800 miles from TN to DC & back in 8 inches). No problems until transmission started slipping at 45,000. It was replaced under warranty. Engine made noise when I picked it up at Dealer. Noise continued in cold weather at startup. Dealer said ""not to worry"". In August noise started & engine disintegrated"
land-rover,freelander,2005,PabloM, 10/22/2007,Rolling disaster,1,"This car is a death trap.  It has completely shut down at highway speeds twice, leaving us coasting and weaving through traffic.  First time the fuel pump died and it seems that the second time this is the same problem. While these are the two biggest problems, it has had several others.  Brakes and rotors shot after less than 14000 miles (this, according to Land Rover, is normal). Runs lousy with various odd noises - it is in the shop all the time.  "
land-rover,freelander,2005,lyn, 04/05/2008,Still love it!!,3,"Bought new 2005 left over. Car has left me stranded two times. Once it was ignition switch, second coil. Road side towed it in. Air is spitting water at passenger side. Now I'm smelling something that is making me sick when heat is on for long periods of time. Smells like coolant. clicking noise like the like the locks are going by themselves. Need another appointment. I love driving the car, but have to admit when the car is out of warranty I getting rid of it. Just not trust worthy and to costly to repair. The oil changes and brake jobs cost way too much! "
land-rover,freelander,2005,A Let Down!, 08/24/2007,A Let Down!,3,The sunroof has been replaced twice so far. Drivers seat belt pretensioner replaced twice and seat belt light comes on when belt is buckled! The key cylinder in the read cargo door fell out and had to be replaced. Seats are hard to keep clean. I expected better from Land Rover and am now afraid to buy the new LR-2!
land-rover,freelander,2005,SE3, 01/03/2008,Finally! An SE3!,4,"The reason why I purchased this 2 door convertible SUV was because I didnt need a large vehicle since its just me and I wanted something that you don't see everyday. For the year 2005, they only produced 234 of these SE3 Freelanders! I also got this one because it had 1600 miles and an extended warranty till 2012. The cool thing is that the back can be removed and the sunroof glass panels can come off entirely for a really open air feeling. It is true that a Jeep Wrangler can become more open air than the SE3 but they are a dime a dozen. It looks very sporty and it gets lots of stares. It even goes off road fairly well although it is restricted on certain terrain due to no low range gear."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Suzanne, 01/30/2005,recent freelander owner,4,"I bought my car 3 weeks ago and I love it. The rides very smoothly...doesn't have that boxy feel that larger suv's have. I probably should do this review again later since I have only had my new freelander for a short time. Just got through my first snow storm and it drove amazing ease throught the snow. If you are a very tall person I would try getting in and out of it several times, you might find it difficult."
land-rover,freelander,2005,California buyer, 02/13/2005,Overall a satisfying vehicle,4,"I love my Freelander for its interior styling and reliability. It does have some quirks, such as the brakes make a subtle noise when I come to a stop but I am getting that checked out. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with my car. It's fun to drive and I feel safe in it."
land-rover,freelander,2005,S Tidline, 02/17/2005,owner,4,I have a 2003 Freelander.  I love the vehicle.  I had a Discovery and sold it because it was too big and cost too much to maintain.  The Freelander drives very smooth. It is comfortable and really nice.  The other great thing about this car vs. the DIscovery is is use 87 grade unleaded gas!  I love the car and hope to only upgrade to a later model one day!  
land-rover,freelander,2005,Brenda, 02/28/2005,So Far,4,"My New 2005 Freelander, so far, has not given me any problems.  It's spacious for a 5'2"", 110 lbs person and rides like a car.  I drive dirt-rocky roads everyday with weather conditions of snow, rain, and mud.  This SUV is the Bomb!  It handled the conditions with ease and makes me feel confident, so far.  Highly recommend if you live where I live and drive where I drive (So. California)."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Christina Sibul, 03/26/2005,unsafe and undriveable,2,"This has been a completely unreliable car.

It's simply unsafe to drive."

What I found is that it is fun to drive, reliable and a real head turner.  If you buy it knowing what you are getting then you probably won't be disappointed.  If you buy a freelander cause it looks pretty and you want a ""luxury"" suv, then you will be disappointed.  "
land-rover,freelander,2005,JustinTimeDC, 06/14/2005,It's a love/hate thing.,4,"I did a ton of research and came up with this car because it is FUN!  The t-roof pops off, hard top comes off, and you are out in the sun.  Seating is excellent, I have a bad back and the support is the best!  You can wipe down the entire inside with water or windex or whatever...keeping it clean is a snap.  It looks fun, and no one has ever seen one before, so it gets a lot of attention.  For a single person like me, it has tons of room for everything I need.  I am a nurse and have to get to work no matter what the weather, and it gets through anything nature dishes out.  I have had a computer/software problem but the dealership works with me and gives me loaners when needed."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Sharon, 06/24/2005,Happy So Far!!!,4,"I am having so much fun with this car! The interior is smaller than what I am used to (I have owned several SUV's in the past). But it's just me so I don't need much room! It has plenty for what I need! I have had no problems whatsoever and am loving driving this car! I have read all about brake problems, transmission, etc. I think every type of car has it's lemons that role off the line every once in awhile! Mine is not one and I am happy to see all of the good and realistic reviews on this vehicle!"
land-rover,freelander,2005,Bill Powell, 06/26/2005,Fun 4x4,4,"I owned a Land Rover Discovery before the Freelander. I find the Freelander to be very capable, comfortable and it does all I ask of it. I like the distinctive exterior style. Compared to the ""thirsty"" Discovery which required premium gas, the Freelander is economical as it gets better mileage and uses regular grade gas. I am very happy with my Freelander after owning it for 15 months and 14,000 miles. Frankly, it fits my needs much better than the Discovery did and is far more reliable. In short, the Freelander is a true Land Rover without some of the shortcomings of the bigger models."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Nichol, 07/20/2005,Run - Run Far Away,1,"Expensive Lemon City - Major electrical issues with engine. Left me stranded 2x for over 6 hrs waiting for LR road side assistance. Radio broke 2x, brakes squeal like pigs, air conditioner poured water on front passengers' feet and spit water thru vents. Engine still smells like it is burning despite mechanics check 2x. Everyone hits head getting into car including 5'0"" ft sister. Stabilizing bar feels off - heard others had problems here. Rear tailgate window drops when car is off, key out & no one is near. Took in 4 repair & mechanics didn't reinstall my rear door lock - took 2 wks for LR 2 fix it. They acted like it was my fault. Not nearly enough luggage space - 2 suitcases MAX."
land-rover,freelander,2005,LOSER, 10/31/2005,BIG joke---on me,2,"We have had the car for a year, and we have taken it in on 7 occasions, most of the things were repeats, squealing brakes, which are apparently normal! Sometimes sticky and sometimes mushy. The traction control turns itself on and off at will. The rear door won't unlock, the window goes down at will- pretty much all things electric don't work. The seatbelts don't work, and the airbag didn't deploy in a wreck. Also the speakers sound like they are blown and always have. The dealer could care less, the mechanics come up with completely assinine excuses for things- when they aren't being extraordinarily rude-don't expect help from the big co. either-nobody will help"

excellent car to have. It has a 
mixture of sportiness, luxury, and 
refinement that you can't find in any 
of its competitors.  Its great in the

great on-road performance. It is very 
stylish and feels great to drive.  The 
only complaint that i have is that it 
is about 20hp short of what it should

speeds and the feel is that of sliding

is the feel of this car.  It gives me 
cause for concern and is not a 
comfortable drive. I am very unhappy 
with these conditions."
land-rover,freelander,2005,Harry Schneider, 05/23/2005,Bad Dic Brakes,2,The Freelander has great visibility and layout. Very tall people cannot get into the cabin easily. Overtaking other vehicles is hard. Vehicle engine feels like a Diesel. Fuel consumption for the weight and slow speed is very high. However its weakest component are the brakes. Dealer says 20000km/14000miles is the norm.Then you have to replace not only the discs but also rotors.Heater and a/c very marginal !
land-rover,freelander,2005,Sadly Disappointed, 05/24/2005,Disappointed Buyer,3,"I absolutely love the look of my Freelander inside and out.  However, I am disappointed at the ergonomics.  I am only 5'5"" and I constantly hit my head getting in and out of the vehicle.  Also, in order to reach the pedals I have to sit so far forward that I cannot use the armrest and the sunroof ends up behind me.  Also, if I put the sunvisor down I can't see out the front windshield.  I have only had my Freelander since January 29th but I am looking at trading it in for something else.

The reason I traded in my 96 Cherokee was I was worried it was going to start costing too much in repairs. Should have stuck it out because I have spent around $1000 already on my Freelander which is probably more than I would have spent on my Cherokee and I didn't have a car payment. I have had the brake pads and rotors replaced twice already. The dealer says it is normal for the Freelander because of the weight. Not good. Also the windshield wipers stopped working. Driver's side in a snow storm and passenger side in the pouring rain. No big deal to fix, but not a good sign of quality in my opinion. Wish I had driven my old Cherokee for a few more years."

The Good- This car is my personal listening room; the sound system is incredible, one of the best I've ever heard in a car. I have the cold weather package and the seats warm up so fast and the defroster a for the windshield and rear are quick as well. Off road, this car is a beast! Even without mudding tires I have never had a moments hesitation, from knee deep mud to deep snow to off roaring on the side of a mountain. It's so comfortable and the way it handles has me weary to ever let the car go. The double sun roofs bring tons of natural light into the car and the visibility is excellent. I turn heads when I drive around town. Tons of small perks as well. I really do love this car. Now, 
The Bad-EXPENSIVE to have worked on. Most mechanics will not work on them as the software required is incredibly expensive for them to purchase. Since I bought the car I have had to replace- Brakes, rotors ($800), new key fob ($425), gear shift spring broken ($800), fob insert detector ($600), rear ball joints ($1200). Also, the spring is broken in my front right; sheared right in half. I'm driving with it now and it's fine: no sounds or decreased performance, but I'm looking at $2200 plus to have it (and the other front) replaced. Yow. That's a lot in 30,000 miles in my experience. Resale is rough on them because of the cost to fix. I love how this car drives and I can haul kayaks, SUPs, my dog, etc.. Without problems. I want to keep fixing it forever, but I will eventually have to make a smart fiscal decision. Oh, and for the gas haters--I get about 17 city and 23-24 highway. Not bad, considering the car weighs 2 tons. You will win if you are in an accident. That alone makes me feel so safe, and if you've ever been in a bad car wreck you know how important it is to feel safe afterwards.

Update-car is now at 126,000 miles and the rotors are toast. That's 30,000 miles on them. O2 sensor went out ($500) replacement and the exhaust is getting noisy. Someone also keyed my front right panel, but I'm not even going to try to figure out how much that will cost. Probably going to sell the car soon; cost of fixing everything will total the car out. It still drives nice and is so comfortable. I will miss this car, but not the expense.

Constant software and electrical issues.  There has been a code that trips the check engine light that is apparently cannot be fixed until new software is produced.  So the engine light comes on and off.  Now the latest which happened today.  Went to start the vehicle and its like it shorted out everything.  Will not start and would not eject the key fob.  This car looks great from the outside but what a mistake I made trading in our STS for this thing.  About to move cross country and now I cannot trust this car."

Glad I didn't listen to the elitist, jaded reviews of car journalists (this site included) and decided on a test drive. The LR2 is a 4200 pound truck, it is not meant to take off like a rocket ship or handle like a Ferrari. That said, anyone not pretending to be Mario Andretti should be well satisfied by its power and cornering ability. The ride is very comfortable even on cratered NYC streets. Had a great time passing people who were out of control and stuck during a recent snow storm. Good fit and finish to the interior.

I Love this LR2. I am short so as I love a lifted truck I no longer love to climb in or out of any vehicle. This, I just slide in and out with no trouble. Every control is within comfortable reach. Living in Minnesota and as cold as it gets here I was thinking of installing an automatic start to this beauty. I found it heats up so fast I shouldn't even bother, especially with the cold climate package. It picks up speed right away, highway driving is a breeze with lane changing, merging, she gets along great with all weather driving on the hwy too! The Alpine sound system is so clear I often thought I was hearing other noises, nope, was so crisp I never noticed all the sound in a piece of music in another vehicle. Best purchase of this year. Ok, for the tough love, if it is not taken care of properly, it will cost more than other domestic suvs/trucks but with all of the amazing features and feel, to me it is worth it. I will be looking for another when it is time. *****Update **** It has been one year now and I love this LR2 as much as the day I bought it!

land-rover,lr2,2008,LR2 Driver, 07/25/2017,"Over 230K and still ""truckin""",5,"This is an excellent value.  Vehicle maneuvers like no other, engine still very strong and does not burn oil.  We have had some smaller issues, post warranty expiration totaling $3000 out of pocket spend.  No complaints.  Car is paid for, and looks and runs super.  Would buy another LR2 in a flash.

land-rover,lr2,2008,Erik Rooney, 03/09/2016,I really like mine!,4,"I've owned my LR2 for just a couple of weeks.  I'm really impressed with the overall quality and craftsmanship.   I do my own maintenance so I can't say the repair cost is out of range.  I would recommend this to a family member.   I'm sure there are better SUV's, but if you don't want to blend into the crowd,  I recommend the Land Rover product.  I did have to have a pulley repaired. It cost $300. I don't necessarily agree with the engineering. It seems to be over complicated. I still love my Land Rover though. Also my starter failed. The engineer is have it right at the bottom of the motor. It took me about 5 minutes to change.

land-rover,lr2,2008,Monebyrd, 07/23/2016,My First Rover!,5,"When I went to the dealership in April,I was looking at an X5 but it was a diesel engine and I was nervous about put gas in it by accident. I was very skeptical of this Landie due to the poor reliability reviews. I made sure I was able to check the history of the truck and it was corporate for 9 months then the owner had it for 6.7years was serviced in the here in the Northeast. I bought it with a warranty as well as my mechanic went over it and changed the oil and brakes for me. I have the cold package with heated seats as well as heated windshield. Love how high it sits. The ride is awesome. Not quick as the Beamer but I luv the fact you can go anywhere in Style and safety. The previous owner took very good care of it! was not afraid of the miles. It does burn oil. I had to replace a quart before oil change (synthetic)premium gas.Plan on keeping it for awhile.update 9 months with 121k driver window regulator is going out but the truck is sound. Stay on top of maintenance. I plan on keeping this until the wheels fall off. If you find a well taken care of Rover, you will be fine. Update: 150 k no significant work except oil change. Runs great!!will keep until the wheels fall off!!1/25/18 Update 1/25/2019 truck has 156890 motor mounts replaced in October 2018. Oil changed on the regular. Battery changed in April 2018.Runs great. Have to change the muffler  but does not affect the truck. Luv it! If you take care of it, it will take care of you. Never left me stranded 🙏🏾Update 7/2019 synthetic oil change every 5-7 thousand miles. Replaced the muffler . Luv it! No problems🙌🏾🙌🏾Update 1/2020  Computer module had to be replaced at dealer bc my mechanic didn’t have the software. Key fob had to be replaced bc the original was worn out. Battery had to be replaced $1155 at dealership very expensive bill and that was a break bc the key fob is normally $500 diagnosed $205/hour then two weeks later starter went out towed to mechanic $540. Not including tow from my mechanic to Dealership $160. I really didn’t have any expensive repairs until going into year 4 . When they hit they hit hard so beware. I will Rock it . It is unique looks good and I wasn’t stranded anywhere( i was at home , nothing would come on) the alarm randomly goes off reading it could be a sensor so watching. Daily driver but I do have a 2016 Acura MDX for back up.7/29/2020.radiator system replaced $1500 and coil packs $160 each with spark plugs. Still got him but pricey.still got the MDX as back up. 174k solid truck still turn heads but now after 4 years of ownership. I am fixing things and the mechanic say it’s a Rover.

Love that car, reliable, safe, fun to drive and a great offroader. However, the visibility was horrible. Next, I looked at the Nissan Xterra. The price was very high considering the features. Then, I looked at the Acura RDX. I liked it, but found it small and didn't have a strong offroad capability. I also looked at the Jeep Liberty, but found the ride horrible despite the nice interior and features. So, I stumbled upon this LR2. I wanted to stay away from Land Rover because of the reliability. However, this car has it all. No problems yet! Look below at the features!"

Sluggish acceleration was only one thing bothered me. On a highway you can use a sport mode to go uphill or to pass another vehicle, but in a city it doesn't help. Soon multiple recalls and electronical problems started building up like snowball and that turned me off. Steering pump broke, heated seats element burned, sunroof went off the rails, check engine light, air pressure gages mulfunctioned, fuel gage drops on zero and ""Low Fuel"" warning beeps with more than half tank of gas. Dealer fixed it, after two weeks got same thing. Bluetooth drops signal very often "
land-rover,lr2,2008,BAD choice ;LR2, 10/25/2010,Reliability is the problem,3,"Once i saw this car i loved the exterior and interior and lots of extras it came with. So i dropped my first choice back then which was the vw Touareg, as i had a concern about the vw reliability. Unfortunately i was totally wrong cause it i never suffered with a car like this LR2, every now and then it should be towed to the dealer for electrical problems, that actually there is no real solution for them. Engine fault and transmission fault are keeping flashing in your face! tail gate got stuck more than once. What a great loss i had spent a fortune to own this LR2 and i cannot depend for long journeys in it."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Rick G., 08/24/2010,3 Year Report,4,"My 2008 Tambora Flame LR2 just turned 3 years old.  I am still completely satisfied with this vehicle.  It has remained very dependable, comfortable, and fun to drive.  Outside of regular maintenance, it has only been in for service for a couple of very minor issues over the past 3 years.  It still gets lots of looks and I still get lots of positive comments from people.  It is a really nice mix of a rugged ""go anywhere"" SUV and a comfortable luxury SUV at a very reasonable price considering all the standard equipment it came with.  I am still very happy with my purchase."

I broke down in SEVEN different states! From NC to CA! Left a LR service center in NM, 6 hrs later I was broke down again in CO! Constant PRICEY services, and with the sporadic dealer locales it can be a bit of travel. Inside, the car is very cheaply ""thrown together."" After 20k miles you never ride in silence!! With everything rattling inside and wind noise it can turn a grouchy morning into an epileptic fit! If you're looking for a car to look at then look no more! If you actually use and DEPEND on a vehicle for more than an eyegasm steer clear"

It is common in these vehicles:( After 3,500 dollars it is fixed and we ended up with 8,000 car at 11,500 + . The interior is falling apart also, sun roof leaks.

The only problems I have had over the past 2 years have been very minor and very easily and quickly resolved by excellent service at my dealer.  I still get many admiring looks and questions about my Tambora Flame colored LR2.  I would have paid thousands more for a comparably equipped X3, Q5, or RX350.  Considering that routine maintenance was also included sealed the deal.  Overall, I have been very happy with my purchase and am always surprised to hear stories of ""bad experiences"" with LR2's since my experience has been the exact opposite (dependable, comfortable, and reliable).

I had problems with air noise and with the front end steering from day one.   I have traded car for BMW that has showed me a Rover is not the way to GO.

We tested the MDX and Nissan Murano and as soon as we got into the LR2 and started it up, we were hooked. Our eyes said it all and our salesman knew  he hooked us. There are 2 improvements that I would have wanted, more horsepower for changing lanes on the highway and the bluetooth doesn't work with my blackberry. But all in all, I would highly recommend the LR2 it is fun to drive and is super stylish. "

For the better part of leasing this car I had trouble starting it.  I just returned again from the dealership yesterday and it stalled in the parking lot and now a new problem my driver window is no longer working. I really give up. I am putting a sign on this car to advise all never to own a Land Rover.

"
land-rover,lr2,2008,Mike, 09/09/2010,UNRELIABLE LEMON,2,"This is my wife's car. She acknowledges that it was a bad choice. Like someone else said, this is not a real SUV. This is a very low car that should really be a station wagon, but a wagon is better because it has more cargo room. The cargo room in the LR2 is a joke. What were they thinking? You could fit one stroller in there and that's it. This is a city car. It will get you from A to B in relative style, and it's easy to park. That's it. It is not a good grocery getter, not a good family car, nothing like that. This car is really meant for single young professionals who are frugal with their money and want to drive a brand name. Electrical left us stranded more than once."
land-rover,lr2,2008,caroline shek, 08/19/2008,Dont Buy!!,2,"This is my second LR2--the first one (brand new) needed a transmission overhaul after 2 weeks.

Its unsafe and unpredictable."
land-rover,lr2,2008,West MI Car Owner, 05/14/2010,Very Disappointed,2,"Good looking and fun to drive when it works.  However, this is the least utilitarian sport utility ever.  Clearly a vehicle designed as a tall station wagon for soccer moms and was a big let-down as my first Land Rover.  Second sunroof was a cool feature until I discovered that prevented me from having a roof rack, and bumper design made a putting on a hitch a very expensive custom job.  The seat heaters drained the battery if you forgot to turn them off and the crazy windshield wipers are $60 each.  Also, dependability was surprisingly poor.  2nd week off the lot the car stalled and died on me and wouldn't start again.  Pretty embarrassing as I was on a 2nd date. I will NEVER buy LR again!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,GeoSmart, 07/08/2019,Anywhere anytime,5,"I've always had beaters and when I had a chunk of money I bought it. It wasn't on the list of acceptable cars to buy but fell in love with its style.

land-rover,lr2,2008,unhappy customer, 12/08/2008,Worst Car Ever,1,"This is the worst care I have ever had. Land Rover is buying it back as a lemon. The car constantly cuts out while driving, the gas gage constantly tells me I have no gas even when the tank is full and I have taken the key out of the ignition and the car stays on and tells me the key is still in the ignition. I have had nothing but problems, it has been in the shop more than at my home and the guys at Enterprise are my new best friends. I would never, ever buy another Land/Range Rover again, or for that matter even take one if someone gave one to me."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Nick Soo, 07/07/2008,Love my LR2,4,"I got my LR2 as a winter car last October. I was well aware of Land Rover's past reliability problems. I have to say that I love my LR2. Some claim it has poor performance for a luxury SUV, but I think it does fine. I have a G35 coupe as well, and I don't think the LR2 is slow for an SUV, and I don't expect it to be a race car. Overall, it's a great ride for someone who wants a very comfortable plush smaller SUV with eye-catching style and lots of technological bells and whistles without paying a fortune. If you want a full-size SUV, it'll disappoint.  If you want a car-like SUV, probably not for you. But if you want an SUV for winter driving and occasional trips, the LR2 rocks"
land-rover,lr2,2008,Mary, 09/14/2008,Quality not so good,2,"I am very unhappy with the quality of my SR2.  The exterior paint is very thin, the drivers side seat has torn, the performance is horrible, the only good thing is the fuel economy.  I have never been this unhappy with a vehicle in my life, I paid approx. $39,000 in Aug. of 2007. I was recently offered $25,000 trade in from the same dealership I paid $39,000 only a year ago. Wow! I have to take a $14,000 loss on this vehicle. I am so unhappy with this vehicle I am going to take the $14,000 loss just to get out of it, however I will never ever purchase another Land Rover or Range Rover ever!"

I previously owned a Discovery and a Range Rover (no problems with these).  After 650 miles, the LR2 started to burn oil.  The dealer's shop said they could not find the problem.  After 1700 miles it started to burn oil again.  The car is in the shop for a week as they take the engine apart to find out why it's burning oil.  Not happy with this lemon.  My BMW has 56000 (3 years old) and NO problems ever.  I have opened a case with LR and have demanded they take the car back.  So much for being practical!"

Easy and fun to drive.  Best vehicle I have ever owned.  Sound system is great as well as the lighting system.  Not so sure about the key.  Several times if you install the key and hit the start button prior to getting your foot on the break the computer gets confused and it has trouble starting.  Take the key out and get the sequence right and it just resets.  Not a big deal if you know about it, but otherwise you could sit for a while.  Just a really nice small sized SUV."
land-rover,lr2,2008,MarkHalp, 01/25/2008,Fantastic SUV,4,"I traded ""down"" to the LR2 from the Range Rover Sport and love this SUV. In some ways it is a more enjoyable vehicle. It has more interior room than the Sport, a comparable stereo, looks and for 2/3rds of the price. Although I have only owned this vehicle for a month it has had no problems which is better than I experienced with the Sport in the same time period. Recommended."

I tried Tiguan, Forester, Patriot, GLK350, etc... nothing was ""the"" vehicle. I happened to drive past a LR dealer near work and the lightbuld went on. Test drove it and knew it was the one.  Great style, great off road ability, gas mileage I can live with. Very surprised by the agility of the vehicle on paved roads.

Had concerns about purchasing an LR based upon reports of mechanical and reliability issues, but after speaking to LR owners and mechanics, it appears the newer models have come a long way. Owner loyalty appears to be solid.  Positives: handles great,  comfortable to drive, great front seats, gas mileage (18- 24), Engine Power, Alpine Stereo, and Bluetooth Technology. Complaints: Need 1-3 feet of more rear cargo space to help with storage, and rear seating space to allow for rear seats to recline for passenger comfort. No roof racks  and no mud flaps came with my HSE model. "

The car looks great inside and out, but I have had nothing but problems with it and it is exceptionally expensive to service.  Even oil changes...can only be done by the dealer.  I would not recommend this car, unless you have a lot of expendable income you would like to blow on service issues!"

I live in Canada and going through the 7 months of Canadian winters you need a reliable vehicle. Aside from the schedule maintenance I haven't had a single issue with it, even after putting 30000 km on it in 9 months the engine still purrs like a kitten.

land-rover,lr2,2008,PC, 02/08/2008,Good! but could have been Great,4,"I bought the LR2 inspite of its poor reliability reputation. It was the right size, price and looked great. I compared it to X3, RDX, RX350,CX7 and it drove and felt the best overall. I would have rated it excellent but for some irritating issues that seem to magnify each day.  First off the gas mileage I've been getting for in-city is 12.5. . Secondly there is no storage area for the driver. All my other cars had something on the dash or below the right arm to store sunglasses,CDs, papers. The bluetooth on this car does not sync w Smartphones which renders it useless. And the Cold Climate package gets you a windshield that produces glare from oncoming traffic. Other than that it's great."

First time it was in for 2.5 weeks, LR didn't have have a P/N for the part that had to be replaced then when they did they shipped it all the way over from the UK.

For tall people, there is more than enough room in the driver's seat. I purchased the upgraded sound system and lighting package. I'm glad I did. Great sound and great visibility at night. My main complaint is with the bluetooth phone system. There are very few phones that are compatable with the LR2 and no PDAs. Hopefully, LR is working on a fix for this.

I got 24 MPG highway on my first tank on the highway up to northern Michigan with cruise set at 70 MPH. The bad part is my 2002 Ford Expedition can climb a sand hill way better since the LR2 doesn't have 4 wheel low but has the power to weight advantage. The second day I drove it there were three things wrong with the vehicle. The air bag system warning light is on, a 12 volt power outlet quit working and the MP3 jack quit working. The key (Landrover calls it ""the unit"") has to be inserted into ""the reciever"" and then you push the start button to start the vehicle. This process doesn't always work. Bad luck or quality?"

How does a key fob effect coolant being burned out of the engine at 2800 miles? Car would not start looked under hood coolant below way below minimum. Car in shop now for 3 weeks. Land Rover clueless as to what is going on and wants us to be the Test Pilots. No Thank you. Same problem happening with other buyers. Land Rovers Solution is that when your car stalls on the freeway to just pull over and take the key out and let it reset and then try again!

Looked at BMW and others, LR2 was hands down the best deal. Lease is up and gf is so upset about turning it in, we are looking into buying it. But I am concerned about maintenance expense as it ages.

land-rover,lr2,2008,rgosalvez, 08/23/2007,So Far So Good,4,"I have owned my LR2 for 3 weeks now. I am very impressed with the level of standard equipment on this vehicle for the price. Comparably equipped X3's and RX 350's are several thousand dollars more. After 3 weeks, I have had no problems at all. I have, however, had many people provide positive comments on the look of the vehicle. The ride is very comfortable and the fuel economy is about what I expected.  Most of the interior build and quality seems good except for some creaking I have noticed in the door panels.  "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Audiallrd to LR2, 01/27/2008,From Audi All Road to L R 2,5,"I must say that since I purchased 4 of 07 that the LR2 has been perfect in every aspect of driving pleasure, no problems or unexpected annoyances. This SUV is a great vehicle.  Land Rover is great!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,Paul, 12/07/2007,Great Rover!,4,Smooth engine and more power than expected. Sound system is awesome! Great turning ratio. 
land-rover,lr2,2008,Ray Moss, 06/10/2008,Needs a diesel engine!,5,I bought my LR2 (called a Freelander 2 in England) in the UK. I wanted a diesel engine so I opted for the UK version. It's strong and gets about 35 MPG around town. The manual 6 speed is smooth. I've been off road and up and down the highways. I love this vehicle.
land-rover,lr2,2008,Rick, 08/11/2008,1 year and going strong,4,I have had my Tambora Flame LR2 for just over 1 year now.  I have had no problems with my vehicle at all. I still get lots of positive comments about its looks.  The only time my vehicle has been in the shop has been for scheduled maintenance and 1 moonroof recall.  I am still impressed with all the standard equipment for the price and still very impressed with the ride and comfort for a compact SUV.
land-rover,lr2,2008,Dave, 04/24/2009,Surprised over-all; very pleased.,4,"I purchased an LR2 with a little trepidation due to the lack of reliability expressed by media auto sources.  However, the brand has one of the highest loyalty bases among car owners, so they must be doing something right.  I purchased it primarily due to the smaller size and potential economic advantages of a smaller SUV. I have been pleasantly surprised by the vehicle.  The mileage is outstanding for an all-wheel drive SUV.  I average almost 20 mpg in mostly city driving (Dallas area, and get 23+ on the highway.  The ride is not at all typical of a short wheel base SUV.  It is extremely comfortable while still giving plenty of control on the road. Fun to drive, and will take me anywhere!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,LTC, 07/27/2010,2008 LR2 HSE,4,I have owned it for just under 2 yrs.  All service free and one quick recall item while in for service.  Average 20 MPG with much stronger V6 than previous Freelander.  It handled the record DC snowstorm with ease.
land-rover,lr2,2008,rovergal, 06/04/2008,My LR2,5,"I've had my car for over a year now and still haven't found anything to complain about.  I'm getting over 25 mpg, it is extremely comfortable to drive, has lots of power when I need it, can traverse muddy, rutty roads with ease, and is just a great car!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,RoverGal, 06/05/2008,I love my LR2,5,"My LR2 is the very first one to be shipped into the US market-Numero Uno. Owned it since April of 2007. All that time, I've had no major problems. A hot restart problem that was fixed right away by the dealer  A couple of rattles that were also fixed right away. The car is incredibly comfortable for me to drive, avg 25 MPG on my daily 44 mi commute, is reliable, and can traverse even the worst of the Vermont ""mud season"" ruts (measured at 14"") with ease.  It looks sexy in Stornoway Gray with the black leather interior, woodgrain trim, and all the options.  I'm sorry others are suffering through ""first year"" syndrome for this.  I've treated mine like a baby and she loves me back!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,Mr. Bill, 06/14/2008,Very Pleased So Far,4,"After 3 months I have no complaints at all. It's the best riding SUV I've ever owned. The dark blue looks great on the outside and the alpaca tan leather looks fantastic on the inside. The build quality is excellent all around. After getting used to the ignition system, I don't even think about it anymore."
land-rover,lr2,2008,GSR, 06/21/2008,I Love It,4,"I love the Land Rover. I have owned Jags and Mercedes plus most of the American and Japanese cars. After 3 months, I am sold on the LR-2 HSE as a real winner. Certainly, I wish it got a little better gas mileage (I can eek out 17 mpg around town).  However, I find the ride quality superb and have absolutely no quarrel with the pick-up.  For over all quality, I believe the LR2 iS a stand-out and a fantastic bargain when compared with the BMW, Mercedes, or other top of the line compact SUVs."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Mike J, 07/02/2008,Stylish Beast,5,"The best looking crossover out there, with tons of safety features- in the safety department, second to none. Everyone thinks it's a Range, but it's half the price and does the trick for me. I've had it for over a month and still love getting inside to drive every day."
land-rover,lr2,2008,BAM, 07/02/2008,Great CUV with Offroad Capability,4,"This is a great crossover SUV, maintains offroad capability while still offering a very nice onroad experience. I spent quite a bit of time comparing to RDX and X3 and test driving each, and disagree with the Edmunds review about ""workaday"" interior with the LR2 compared to the X3. The seats are great and the interior is sharp too. Acceleration won't be winning any races, but it's just fine for what it needs, I never feel like the engine is straining at any speed.  Although the cargo space is listed as lower than the X3, it didn't really seem so after taking a look inside. I would definitely recommend this car to a friend."
land-rover,lr2,2008,horsedoctor, 07/05/2008,From an X5 to LR2,4,"Coming from an 03 BMW X5 makes it difficult to give this vehicle perfect marks in any departement. But a new X5 with similar options was well over 50K - my loaded LR2 was purchased for under 35K and as usual in life: you often get what you pay for. The layout and the interior design gets high marks-as well as comfortable seats and nice features such as satellite radio, heated windshield and seats, sport drive feature, security of full time all wheel drive - all while approaching 24mpg hwy and I'm getting 19mpg combined.  The storage areas are a bit lacking and I would have rather had a nice center armrest with more storage below it than the drop down ones. Overall this is a great SUV."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Fred, 07/12/2008,"LR-2, a great vehicle for all occasions!",4,"Car is a bargain for the money.  Lots of thought went into it, lots of standard equipment.  Engine is good, not overly robust, but good.  Road characteristics are great and car is quiet. Seating position is very good. HVAC system is excellent. Car should go a long way to erase old stereotypes of Land Rovers. Liked the fact that Ford owned company, don't know how the new owner, TATA will favor. High-intensity headlight option package is terrific, worth the money."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Mr. B, 09/07/2008,2.2 DIESEL LR2 but not in the USA,4,"My wife was transfered for temporary assignment in England last year and was provided a car expense fund. She chose a ""DIESEL"" LR2 (Freelander 2) that is available everywhere in the world except the USA. It is a 2.2 liter common rail, turbo charged unit with an automatic transmission. On a number of trips we took into mainland Europe, we averaged low to mid 30 MPG on the highway and low 20 MPG in city driving. The build quality was excellent and durability was bullet- proof. And the MPG was a shocker! Note: Fuel prices in Europe are considerably higher. She got a great small/mid-sized SUV with all the creature comforts - loaded - for significantly less money compared to BMW or Mercedes."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Jen in 5280, 09/12/2008,I love my LR2,4,"I've had my LR2 16 months now. I love it. It has never let me down. I have had a few minor problems that the dealer was happy to fix. They even fixed the minorist of complaints.  I asked them to readjust my windshield wiper spray and my headlights. The car is excellent in the mountains, excellent in the snow and an excellent daily driver.  I have great confidence in my Rover and wouldn't hesitate to drive it anywhere.  "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Love the LR2 HSE, 10/18/2008,Fell in love with Rimini Red,5,"Looked for a smaller SUV to replace Grand Crapokee Overland and test drove lots of others. Loved the LR2 and bought it. Rimini red/Alpaca is beautiful and the 19"" wheels are striking and not tacky. Kudos to LR for this excellent midsize SUV. Drives like a sports car. Return LR/RR customer. "
land-rover,lr2,2008,DH, 12/14/2008,30 K report,5,"Just took it in for 30K check up. Been flawless thus far, all I have done is the free service. Lots of fun to drive, 22 mpg. Very happy with this purchase."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Jason in California, 12/28/2008,Solid Small SUV,4,"I've been driving my LR2 in Northern California for more than a year and I've had no problems at all (and I'm surprised to read about othes who have had problems).  In fact, I'm quite happy with it. Acceleration is mediocre, but it feels confidently solid and smooth at speed on the highway. Steering can be a bit sensitive, but it is easy to get used to. I found the fit and finish pretty nice, with with leather seats and rubberized utilitatian knobs. Particularly for its price. It is sure-footed in the snow and has seems to have more rugged capabilities than others in its class. With the seats down, there's lots of room. I've been very happy with my LR2."
land-rover,lr2,2008,ccaparelli, 12/30/2008,"1st car bought outside the ""big"" 3",4,"Having owned 2 Jeep Grand Cherokee's and a Ford Explorer, this was the first SUV I've owned outside of the ""Big"" 3. Needless to say, I have been extremely pleased with my LR2 so far.  I've put just under 7,000 miles on it and have averaged 18 mpg city and 23/24 mpg highway, using standard fuel (87 oct) with no noticeable pinging/knocking. The interior may not be as pretty as a BMW, but it is very practically designed.  Vision from the drivers seat is fantastic,very few blind spots. The nav system is very interactive and works great, and the sound system, although a little light on bass, is very good. Acceleration is a bit sluggish, but it's an SUV with good fuel economy, not a corvette"
land-rover,lr2,2008,Nick S, 01/09/2009,Love my LR2,4,"I purchased my LR2 SE in October 2007 as a winter vehicle to get me around while in graduate school. I looked at Nissan Pathfinders, and a few other SUV's in the mid $30K price range. The test drive sold me on the LR2, and I couldn't be happier. It's a great car. Fantastic on road trips, and very easy to drive. The seats are very comfortable, and while it's not a tiny SUV, it's not huge either. Enough space to carry whatever I need, and compact enought to drive in town every day.  In bad weather, it gets an A+. The snow terrain response setting is phenomenal, as are the headlights and nav.  "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Kerstin, 01/16/2009,Worst Car I Ever Bought,2,"This is the 2nd Land Rover I've purchased. I had a 2006 LR3 and should have known better but figured the 2nd one couldn't be as bad as the first one. Wrong! The car was beautiful, orange, black leather, loaded. It was in for repairs more than I had it. I had some serious electrical issues that the dealer was unable to diagnose. Once the car stalled at a traffic light and I had to coast out of a major intersection. I only kept the car 6 months. It was not reliable and I worried constantly about being stranded in it.  Never knew if it would start up or die on me.  Only got 18mpg! (when it was running!)"
land-rover,lr2,2008,gerd Budden, 01/24/2009,love my LR2,5,"I leased the car Sept 07 and drive about 15k a year. We had a lot of snow this winter in Oregon. the 4-wheel drive system is outstanding. often I was the only driver in my family, could go everywhere. there are no blind spots, the finishing is superb. this is a quality car that pleases. I took some trips and got  up to 26.9 miles on the freeway. I give it a 10 "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Russ, 02/16/2009,"Love the car, but",3,"We bought the car in Oct 07 fully loaded. We have had the car in the shop 13 different time to repair things like sensors, temp sensor, tire pressure sensor, occupancy sensor on passenger seat (still not working right). We have had many problems with the bluetooth. They put a new module and microphone (still not working right). Navigation problem, not to mention weather stripping and other trim parts replaced.  Front drivers seat was replaced after leather cracked. Front windshield had a stress fracture that they replaced. The car has been in the shop the last 5 days they are saying it needs a fuel pump and maybe more. not sure. "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Daniel, 02/22/2009,"Great choice over BMW, Acura, Mercedes",4,"I get bored with cars quite often, but my LR2 is staying for another couple of years with me.  I love the LR2. Performance: Coming from a V8 Mercedes(CLS) just prior to purchasing LR2, I was worried I wouldn't be happy with the performance and the ride. Acceleration could be better, but it has plenty of torque for merging on to fast traffic. Ride: LR2 offers a good mix of comfortable ride and capability. I go to Sierra Nevada often during winter, and AWD system performs very well. Off-road capability is also outstanding for a car this size. Handling: Fun! A bit of oversteering around the sharp corners, but it's still great. Quality: Rivals other luxury brands (BMW, Mercedes, etc.)"
land-rover,lr2,2008,MAS, 01/25/2008,Love it,5,"Couldn't be happier.  Very practically design.  Have a black, fully loaded SE that I got for less than the wifes Highlander.  Looked at them all and if you want useful features, this is the most for the money.  Handles great, I get 19.5 mpg averaging 41 mph combined driving.  Very comfortable, Nav & bluetooth are great as well as the heated windshield.  Have to love the Volvo engines, 240 K on my last one and it still ran as good as the day I bought it.  You can tell it's built for the long run.  Only 3600 miles on it thus far no problems.  I didn't even know the LR2 exited when I was looking.  Saw it on Edmunds, ended up test driving it 6 times before buying."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Duane, 01/25/2008,LR2 - Excellent for new families!,4,"The LR2 is the perfect car for someone who is expecting their first child or travels out of the city.  The cabin fits 5 passengers comfortably with a good amount of room for storage. The engine provides enough power, but does not perform like a sports car.  The issue is whether that is what you are looking for. The fuel economy is fine, if you learn how to drive the engine. The LR2 is a great buy combined with the Land Rover no service charge for scheduled maintenance and other premium services such as road assistance are included with purchase."
land-rover,lr2,2008,John67, 01/28/2008,More bang for your buck!,5,"Wow! My new LR2 has been the greatest car I've ever owned. Where do I begin? Great styling. Other people love it also. Plenty of pep. I like the maintenence being included. I have yet to have any problems. What is there not to like about this car? By far the best in its class. A lot of great standard options. Sunroof standard. Not everyone has one which I great. I'm sure I'll start seeing more since they have only been out less than a year and only bring a few into the U.S..Just a great, fun car! Wow!"

land-rover,lr2,2008,Gary Wood, 07/04/2010,Love it!,4,"Other than one misalignment of the sunroof (which has worked perfectly after repair), the LR2 has been a gem.  I am completely satisfied and with close to 45K, it is still like new.  We have driven it across country a couple of times without a problem. "
land-rover,lr2,2008,mks, 02/06/2008,Great Little SUV,5,"Haven't been this happy with a vehicle in a long time.  Luxury, fun and practical all in one.  Averaging about 19 mpg with an average speed of only about 35 mph combined driving. Have a fully loaded SE that I got for several K less than the wifes hybrid Highlander and like it much better.  Feels more solid and handles much better. Love the stereo and Nav system. Very sure footed in the snow and smooth on the highway. Just fun to drive."
land-rover,lr2,2008,DPA, 02/07/2008,Great Buy!,5,"I bought the LR2 in July '07 and just hit 28,000 miles. Other than taking it in every 7500 miles for service, there have been no problems to report. It rides very smooth on the road, and handles well at high speeds."
land-rover,lr2,2008,PM, 02/16/2008,Most Bang for the Buck in this Segment,4,"It looks great, rides great and seats 4 or 5 more comfortably, with more elbow room and an overall more spacious feel than the BMW X3 or Acura RDX.  Body is very rigid and conveys ""bank-vault"" solidity. Acceleration is more than adequate in real world conditions (even if on paper it seems slow by comparison). Handling is more truck like than the others, but that has some charm. Braking is excellent, though as with cornering there's a fair amount of body dive/roll.  MPG is worse than I expected both highway and city. I average about 18 overall.  I have had multiple, though generally minor, problems that resulted in trips to the dealer. But overall a better deal -- and much more unique. "
land-rover,lr2,2008,newguy9, 02/19/2008,Just got it,4,"Just got it 4 days ago & love it. The gas millage is brutal, but love the truck! Can't believe that there are no floormats- that's crazy!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,mike, 04/17/2007,A winner for Land Rover,4,"Excellent vehicle so far! So glad we waited till these were available. Handles like a much smaller vehicle, but feels so capable! Very impressed and confident driving this SUV. Purchased with all options and the color shown on this web site. Excellent Volvo engine pulls very nicely with lots of torque. Nav is great. Wife and kids love it too! The size is just right without that big and bloated feeling we had with other SUVs. Must say the brakes are fantastic and build is top notch!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,mike, 04/25/2007,"Great 4x4, should have been a sports car",4,Very impressed with ths vehicle. Glad we waited for its release. The size is right and it handles like a sports car unlike what you might expect. My only gripe might be gas mileage which is increasing  as it breaks in. Otherwise we are pleased with all other aspects of this vehicle. My kids love the nav- (we have all options) and find it very easy to use. Would recommend to anyone who wants a real 4x4 and all the options without the big bloated feel of most other 4x4's.
land-rover,lr2,2008,Kman, 05/05/2007,500 miles and loving it,4,"I recently purchased the new LR2 and must say that at 500 miles I love this vehicle. It may to a little too early to tell but I am confident this will set a new bar for LR. The vehicle has the 3 options packages (climate, lighting and tech) which I was at first apprehensive on paying for. However when you consider that Honda's and Suzuki's come with leather, navigation and decent sound systems it only makes sense to get a Land Rover loaded. "
land-rover,lr2,2008,yeomancavalry, 05/13/2007,LR2 is solid,5,"Excellent visibility, excellent ride, and very little wind noise. Standard luxury interior, standard features are simply remarkable for a vehicle within the $35,000 price range. For a small ute it has excellent leg space and headroom. The wide body gives a nice distance between driver and passenger. Dependable terrain response. Fully more off-road capable than initially expected despite not being a true 4x4. GPS is awesome! Well laid out. Very solid doors. Lots of safety standards like driver's knee airbag. Related to the Volvo S81, so you know its safe! Peppy motor and easy access maintenance. Awesome 7.1 channel Dolby, 14 speakers surround sound!"

The finishing is superb, the look is awesome and we get looks from a lot of people on the road, both young and older. Ours is Narvik Black with tan interior and all the options, GPS, adaptive headlights, upgraded stereo. This true luxury, not BMW's faux luxury and leather""ette"". And what a great price difference!

The nav system is simple to operate. There is a lot of information available on the screen. Once you get familiar with it, it becomes easy to read on the fly. Off Road this car showed its Land Rover DNA. The sport mode makes it fun to drive. Great car overall. Very happy with my purchase.  "

Originally I was thinking about buying a LR3 but needed something a little smaller and the BMW X3 didn't cut it.  Overall the exterior and interior look of the vehicle is sharp but I wish the engine had a little more HP...like 275- 280. I primarily use the LR2 for work so it's mostly paved road driving which is very comfortable. However I recently took it off road and realized it was truly a Land Rover but it does have a pretty good sway over rough terrain. For myself, my wife and dog this is our weekend getaway vehicle and it is more than enough room and very fun."

I've owned 3 Jeep Grand Cherokees, 2 Audis and an Acura TSX and this has been the most fun to own and drive. Handles like a dream and to me the performance is just fine. In Sport Mode rocks! Don't be fooled by the motor trend article that criticizes the perf. Plus the breaking and handling of this SUV is wonderful. Great value when you consider a Toyota Rav4 Limited w/Leather and sunroof runs $30k. The LR2 with cold pack is $34. The X3 was way over priced and the RDX was way to harsh like my TSX was. I wanted smooth and posh, now I got it in style! Thank you Land Rover!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,nekemomo, 09/28/2007,I Love my LR2,5,"I have to say I was getting discouraged with some of the cross- overs as I was looking for a new vehicle. My husband sent me the link to check out the LR2 and I instantly was intrigued. We went and test drove the vehicle and it was a done deal. It handles exceptionally well, has a smooth ride and excellent technology. Whenever I am driving in town people check out my car, and I get tons of compliments. You don't see many of them on the road, which is another great thing about Land Rover. I couldn't be more in love with my car!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,Mike, 05/21/2007,"Great First Month, Bluetooth needs a fix",4,"I've had my LR2 (fully loaded) for about a month now.  I've been very impressed with the ride (as good as the X5 and much better than the X3).  The seats are comfortable and the sound system and tech package(upgrade) are worth the upgrade. My main complaint is the bluetooth technology. While the bluetooth connected with my son's simple Motorolla cell phone, you can't find a smartphone (ie, Blackberry, Treo, Q, etc) that works with any carrier.  What was Land Rover thinking? I'm told that other phones will be added.  Most auto manufacturers that offer Bluetooth will have at least a couple of smartphones that connect.  I'm very disappointed that this great option is useless at this time."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Mike, 05/18/2007,Fun little SUV,4,"Just purchased my LR2 a month ago. I love it! It's fun to drive, comfortable, and looks great. I'm making my first trip to Montana next month and will submit an off road review then. I'm sure I won't be disappointed. I traded my Audi A6 S- line in for this. I thought I was going to compromise some driving performance for a better fishing vehicle, surprise!  The LR2 has a very sprited inline 6 that won't leave you wanting for more power. Great job Land Rover!"
land-rover,lr2,2008,tom m, 06/08/2007,Love the LR2,5,This vehicle continues to amaze me with its incredible design features which makes it so enjoyable to drive. It is very comfortable to drive with precise steering and powerful brakes. The fuel economy has been much better than I had expected with  mileage rarely less than 20 MPG and as much as 30 MPG when driven at steady 60 MPH. My major problem is getting the car before my wife takes it.
land-rover,lr2,2008,Allan, 06/29/2007,Fun to drive,4,"This is my first SUV and I'm enjoying the experience immensely. The first 2000 miles have been a joy and the quality is amazing. This is definitely an excellent value. The comfort is better than the Mercedes CLK it replaced. The safety features are second to none. The upgraded 14 speaker sound system has a range that makes it a joy to listen to, especially the classical music, where the highs and lows are lost in most vehicles. The upgraded halogen headlights follow the steering wheel around corners and up and down hills. There is so much to recommend in this vehicle, I suggest you take it for a spin. This is my first Range Rover, but it won't be my last."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Dwheels, 07/19/2007,A little glitch but still good,4,"I bought my LR2 and took it home, unfortunately the fan module broke and the fan ran for an hour after I got home, I had to disconnect the battery and take it back in the morning. They patched it up and I was on my way. I work in Construction, and this car rocked out on the site, no problems in the sand or mud, it wa great! Got it a bit dirty, but handled great. I expect a few more glitches to come, but the service staff was great, so I didn't worry."
land-rover,lr2,2008,lakes00, 08/17/2007,Overall best luxury small SUV,5,"I checked quoted and test drove the whole small SUV market. I chose the LR2 on features, looks, comfort and warranty. Within price range my finalists were the X3, Tribeca and the LR2. The LR2 won on features, comfort and looks. Lease price was the hardest part to digest, BMW and all others offered much better deals. I do love this little SUV, as it is so much fun to drive. Fuel economy is pretty decent for an SUV (getting 21.3 avg MPG). The standard Alpine radio is excellent. I do not recommend buying the Technology package. Tech package is $4000. For $350 I bought a Garmin navigation with Bluetooth that fits perfect in the NAV space..and the bluetooth does work with my Blackberry."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Nikki, 09/19/2007,"Looks good, runs bad!",3,"I have owned the car for a little over 90 days now, and it has been at the dealership for repair for 35 of those days. Parts to fix the LR2 seem to be quite complicated to get, I have been waiting 2 weeks for a gasket on my new cylinder head. But then, who would think you have to replace a cylinder after 90 days? I also had problems with the car not starting/stalling out.  "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Roverette, 11/12/2007,Great Fun!,4,"Enjoyable car to drive. Handles well. Drive is comfortable. Not too hard, not too soft. You have the ability to change how the tranny works and the suspension changes, too. Very roomy, great visibility. Nice looking vehicle. Runs great. Quiet on the road. You can buy this and feel confident that it will be running well for years to come. Very solid automobile."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Eunice, 11/13/2007,"Great car & look, needs better mileage",4,I've had this vehicle for 5 months now and I haven't had any problem with it. I am impressed with how smoothly it drives and the turns are fantastic. It is very quiet and the seats are extremely comfortable. The car looks small but there is plenty of leg room.
land-rover,lr2,2008,Jean Orr, 11/07/2007,Great Choice When Off-Road is a Priority,5,"Have owned since the end of August, & have put 6,000 miles on the vehicle. I bought it because Im a Real Estate Broker and sell large acreage properties upstate NY and wanted a good off-roader that wouldn't break the bank in the mpg department. Also, something with alittle snob appeal to impress my clients. This vehicle fits the bill perfectly--great off-road over hill and dale (and the back 40-- acres--that is), but has a wonderful on-pavement ride, my clients find it very comfortable, love the climate control, visibility, good acceleration, sound system, easy-to- use nav system, and, the interior finish is understated but elegant with nice wood accents. Has been mechanically perfect so far. "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Stonefoxx, 11/07/2007,Excellent AWD Medium SUV,4,"2200 miles so far, I test drove everything in the med. SUV class, BMW overcharges for every option- many standard features w/ LR2 including real leather seats. This by far was the best overall ride and comfort. I have had a minor issue with the audio 2x when I put the key in the audio was muted- after I took the ""unit"" (lr2's name for the remote key) out and put it back in all was well. I highly recommend this vehicle to any one looking for a safe med. SUV "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Daniel, 11/18/2007,Excellent. I don't miss my Mercedes CLS,4,"I just purchased LR2 with all available options a week ago, so I cannot comment on reliability. Safety: I've seem some crash photos from UK, and LR2 seems to be a solid truck. Power: 230HP/234lb.ft. Number isn't impressive, but that's how the engine should be for SUVs;Torque. Plenty quick. Warranty: Meets STD 4yr/50K. Maintenance included for 4 years is very nice. Other things: It's unbelievably quiet for an SUV, its tech upgrades work well.(great nav system, bluetooth, etc.) Unbeatable off-road capability. Exterior looks top-class and interior is small but luxurious and super comfortable. I don't miss my 2006 V8 Mercedes CLS (trade-in) at all. Not as fast, but I love the new LR2"
land-rover,lr2,2008,NY / SI, 11/18/2007,Great vehicle,4,"Had it since April-no major problems (no sound from radio fixed by software re-load, small ratle in the door fixed during 6 mo. service.

land-rover,lr2,2008,Chris Nordstrom, 11/28/2007,Baby Rover,4,"It is sad to read the bad reviews by some owners. I have had many vehicles over the years (including other Land Rovers), but have to say this has been a great vehicle so far. I have owned the vehicle since April and to date have 12,000 miles on it with no problems. Ride, comfort and handling are all great. I average any where from 18-24 MPG depending my combined driving. Better fuel economy would be nice, but it seems to be on par with others in its class and engine size."
land-rover,lr2,2008,pressare, 03/10/2008,Would buy it again!,4,"I've had the LR2 for a little over a month (February- March) in Cleveland Ohio, so saying that, I've been impressed by how the truck both handles & performs in this harsh climate. I really like it & I've owned a BMW & Jeep's & neither truck comes close. The fuel mileage is bad, but who cares, it probably cost me an extra $300-$400 year (worth it!)  "
land-rover,lr2,2008,roverette, 11/30/2007,Very Happy with this vehicle,4,"Wow. After much research, I decided to purchase the Land Rover LR2. It's been a great choice for me. It's large enough to haul around what I need, and it still fits in the garage. Gas mileage has been averaging 22 mpg - that is a mix of highway and city driving. Comfortable interior, great visibility, tons of room."
land-rover,lr2,2008,EZ, 12/05/2007,Traded the 99 DISCO II,4,"90K miles later, we traded the 99 Discovery II for the LR2, SE, Narvik Blk, Alpacha, Cold Pack, Light Pack, and Teck Pack.  I drove all the others and kept coming back to Land Rover.  Had great service from the DISCO and have 550 miles on the LR2.  Fun to drive, much better MPG than the Disco.  The key system is a bit funky, but if you let the vehicle recieve the key instead of shoving it in, there will be no probs.  Added the roof rack, cross bars, mud flaps and trailer hitch for bike rack.  Drives smooth and plenty of power from the 6 cyl.  Not the boss hog SUV for sure, but for the mid-size it is a winner."
land-rover,lr2,2008,sww, 03/25/2008,New and loving it so far,4,"Finally bit the bullet and made a decision and glad I did. So far the LR2 has been great fun to drive and is a very comfortable ride. I purchased the cold climate package (love the seat heaters), Nav and stereo upgrade (I think they have me hooked on Sirius) and the lighting package, which might be my favourite part. The lighting package is like having a stadium's worth of spotlights behind you showing you the way. Added on the roof rails (they should be standard)"
land-rover,lr2,2008,Craig, 04/05/2008,Very Impressed,4,"The 2008 Land Rover LR2 is a great little car. I bought it 3 months ago and have put nearly 11,000 miles on it. Zero problems. Runs perfectly -- averages 22 mpg everyday -- 25 mpg on trips (no kidding). Comfortable with plenty of power -- can't believe it's a six. What's not to like about this vehicle! Get the nav upgrade -- the sound system is one of the best I have ever heard."
land-rover,lr2,2008,Rover Girl, 04/06/2008,"So far, so good",4,"Another satisfied owner, at least so far. Only owned two months & driven 1,200 mi., but absolutely love the vehicle! Gets lots of attention, yet have only seen one other LR2 on the road here since they existed. Love that - driving something unique, not the same vehicle in everyone's driveway. Just holding my breath that it proves to be reliable. Replaced my Montero Limited, which had only one minor issue over nearly 100K miles. Don't expect that from a Land Rover, but hoping for the best! Like most people, I considered nearly every other SUV out there in this class, but liked this one the best. Planned on an LR3, but the LR2's are actually more advanced, & look to be much more reliable."
land-rover,lr2,2008,slojas1, 12/11/2007,LR2 Gets the Job done,4,"The LR2 fits 5 passengers comfortably with a good amount of room for storage. The 3.2L I6 engine provides enough power for passing at high speeds. The fuel economy is passable at a combined 17.5 mpg. The LR2 is a great buy combined with the Land Rover no service charge for scheduled maintenance. Other premium services such as road assistance, and others are included with purchase. These features scores major points as they are services that are usable.  "
land-rover,lr2,2008,Charles Green, 04/14/2008,Fun Vehicle / Great Value,4,"Purchased mid August 2007. 6500 miles currently. Only dislike is the heated windshield. Embedded wires cause glare at night and you can see them during the day. This is a fun vehicle to drive. Fast and stable. Plenty of interior room for driver/passengers. The only time you know you're driving a small vehicle is when you back up and realize there is still plenty of room to maneuver. RIM has a download for their Blackberry, Bluetooth now works great. First SUV I've really felt comfortable driving. Many like the X5 feel too ponderous, you can feel every pound in the steering. Many other SUVs don't even pretend that they could go off road.  Added roof rails and mudguards. Lots of compliments."

I get stopped a lot by people telling me how sharp my car looks. I see a lot of LR2's around beautiful Santa Barbara. Kids love their own sunroof for the backseat !
land-rover,lr2,2008,Trooper, 05/17/2008,Adaptive Lighting,3,"Adaptive lighting failed whilst driving at night on the day I collected my new car. Dealership ""upgraded"" the software however, this did not rectify the problem. After several emails to Land Rover UK, the diagnosis is that one of the motors needs replacing as the light is not swiveling as far as it should. Identical issue as 'misswho'. Will advise once motor replaced if this solves the problem. I currently (touch wood) have no issues with starting the engine!"

land-rover,lr2,2009,W. Debley, 03/10/2009,Rent before you buy!,3,"The LR2 was my first choice because of the styling taken from it's big brother, the Range Rover sport. Thank goodness I rented before I took the plunge (I backed out). The LR2 is under powered and presents a problem when passing on the highway. The body roll is significant, and if you had to swerve to miss and object in the road , it could get dicey. The off-road capability is robust and it does about 90% of what it's larger counter-part can do, so, no complaints there. The seats are small, and hard as a board. The seating position is high and upright. The interior is small, without much cargo space. So forget bringing your buddies and their gear on an outing. The interior is pretty basic."
land-rover,lr2,2009,Bill, 04/14/2010,better postioned than the Freelander,3,"Having previously owned an Lr3 and Freelander, the Lr2 sits comfortably as the entry Land Rover.  Off road/Snow capabilities are very strong, and extended driving stretches of 8 plus hours with a family of four are certainly comfortable. Great driver visibility all around. Sun roof in front/moon roof in back make the cabin feel airy and spacious. Armrests are comfortable enough, but lack the plushness of the Lr3.  Adequate storage space in back, good sound system, great warranty.   Would recommend for those looking for a compact SUV with better than average snow/off road capabilities.  "

This vehicle is just awesome and towed brilliantly along with going truely off road through deep soft sand, over rocks and never missed a beat. Aside from a small steering rack issue that was fixed when it was a few weeks old the car has been perfect and my wife went from sceptic to Landrover fan!"

I have heard stories of the maintenance costs and suspension having issues but mine has 125,000 miles now and I haven't repaired anything other than your standard use items (brakes/rotors, tires). The ride is not luxurious but let's be real, a Land Rover is made to go off road. If you want a nice highway car don't get a Land Rover.

The interior works for this vehicle and is easy to control.  There is more then enough room in the back and excellent head room compared to any of the other vehicles that we looked at.

land-rover,lr2,2009,Thorsten, 11/28/2009,Back on the map,4,"A great car and great value for your money. So far I had no issues, the car feels well build and I love to drive it. For an SUV you can drive it very sporty (has enough power)without feeling uncomfortable or unsafe. The stereo system (Alpine Dolby Surround)is fantastic, bluetooth connects right away to any of my phones (con: could be louder). Navigation is terrific but the updates are very pricey. The breaks are great (I have the 19"" wheels) and the engine sounds awesome, Fuel economy is great on average 14-16 mpg city, 23-26 mpg highway (what do you expect it is an SUV). In summary it is a great all- round vehicle, which puts Land Rover back on the map"
land-rover,lr2,2009,Angela, 07/23/2019,DO NOT BUY,2,"This has been easily the worst car I have ever owned,! I bought used and it's been nothing but a financial drain. I have only owned the LR2 for 3 months and do far I've spent just over 5k in repairs. We took it to The Land Rover dealership to get the AC fixed and they said they couldn't do it. You know what they could do? They found 4,600 dollars in other non AC related issues. We figured we could find a local mechanic that would charge less so we went to pick it up. Tried to start the car and it wouldn't turn on. Land Rover dealership said they needed another $800 for a new starter. these cars are more work than they are worth and it's extremely hard to find someone willing to work on them. I think people are attracted to the name Land Rover and they shouldn't be. 100% overrated!!!!

It handles like a sports car around town and a jeep off road.  I have been driving 4X4s at work for near 35 years and can't believe how this rig takes all the drama out of muddy roads.  This is a real 4X4 and Land Rover stuffed in about every technical option available somewhere into this high quality rig.  No problems so far.

No, it is not as spacious as the Acadia, but drives like a pure luxury car.
The gas mileage has been better than expected. In comparison to the price of the loaded Rogue we well overpaid for, this vehicle feels more stable and quiet frankly is worth every penny. I love the safety features and the ride.
Land Rover made an affordable alternative for the Middle Class.
Always check your options on a nice pre-owned vehicle you love before settling for a new vehicle you hope will grow on you."

If you're not obese you will be o.k. with the armrest.
What the heck do people put inside a console anyway??
If your family does not resemble the Brady Bunch, you'll be just fine with cargo space, and with space in general.
The SUV is well built, rides smoothly and comes with tons of features for which you'll have to pop extra bucks on RX350s, X3s or X5s, ML 350s or GLK350s.

The arm rest is very thin and cuts the circulation no matter what height or arm position. If you put the arm rest up there is no where to put your arm. What is worse is that in the up position, the metal adjustment screw, (about 2"" x 3"")sits inches from the right temple area of your head. Scary.  The seat positions are limited, inability to angle front of drivers seat cuts leg circulation. It rattles alot and ""ka-thunks"" in several areas, over every little bump. I sure hope it has good off road ability to make up for the lack of comfort and road noise."

The only done to the lr2 lately has been tires and oil changes. It's basically a Volvo inline 6 cylinder but has ran great in the 6 years I've owned it. It could use a bit more horsepower and doesn't get great gas mileage, but it's still enjoyable to drive and we still take it on trips.

land-rover,lr2,2013,Tom, 02/10/2016,Great hidden gem.,4,"I have a 2013 lr2 which I bought used and its been an absolute delight to drive. Its tough in the snow and handles it with ease an expertise, easily navigating the accumulated feet of snow and ice collected on our streets here in Buffalo NY. It's got great pick up and can be described as peppy as the engine picks up pretty quickly with pretty good acceleration and passing speed. Everyone who gets inside of it is impressed by its understated class and prestige and its commanding presence. The seats are more similar to the cockpit of an airplane as you sit straight up with armrests that are similar to a planes with great visibility if the road from all windows. Despite its off road credentials, its a really smooth ride. The Bluetooth works great and its awesome not having to fool around with an aux chord. As soon as I get into the truck, it syncs and plays all of my downloaded music. It has heated seats and a heated steering wheel as well as a winter mode which automatically raises your wipers off the ceiling to avoid freezing to the windshield . For someone who doesn't want to dump the cash into a range rover, has a small family and doesn't need the 3rd row seating of the lr4 and if you don't like the newer rounded style that land rover is adopting in contrast to the classic  classy boxy lines still possessed by these, then it might be a great choice. Not sure why they never caught on in the US but now as an owner, I believe it's our countries loss.

land-rover,lr2,2015,Mike D, 09/06/2015,Great Vehicle for Anything,5,"I purchased my LR2 immediately prior to one of the most punishing winters in New England history and put 13,900 miles on it in a year of driving (mixed town/highway use as a daily driver). 

The all-wheel drive system of this SUV is unmatched by any other SUV in the compact market. When forced to drive in several of the blizzards with 1-2 feet of snow, I simply placed the vehicle into snow mode and had no issues driving on untreated roadways. The climate controls are all control dials, which made it easy to adjust while driving. The voice-activated navigation, heated steering wheel/seats were also incredible. The 4 cylinder turbo engine moves the vehicle, giving it a sporty and fun driving experience when paired with the nimble nature of the steering system. Another cool feature for cold weather drivers is the heated windshield. Land Rover wove miniature wires through the windshield that heats the entire thing when activated (which prevents just a small section defogging and instead rapidly dissipates condensation and ice development).

The negatives to the vehicle are its compact cabin (but it is a compact SUV and I am 6' tall), the presence of turbo lag when accelerating, the poor fuel economy when compared to other vehicles in this segment, the lack of a power liftgate (which has now become standard among LR2's competitors), and the small amount of legroom for rear passengers (once again; its a compact SUV).

In the 13,900 miles that I drove the vehicle I experienced 2 mechanical issues. The first issue was a ""low coolant"" message that occurred when it was -20 degrees out. The vehicle did not have low coolant however, and the message disappeared after running the engine briefly. The second issue was a ""service required"" message that came on after bringing the vehicle in for its first annual service. I had to bring the light to the dealership three times to stop the message from appearing. All of this was covered under vehicle warranty, however it was an annoyance and the service experience was not what I would have expected from a luxury car brand.

All said, this vehicle is incredible if you need to have the confidence to get through anything that nature throws at you (While keeping you extremely comfortable). If you're willing to compromise on that ability, other SUV's offer more technologically advanced features and much better fuel economy ratings.

land-rover,lr2,2015,Boston Suburban driver, 01/11/2017,LR2 replacement is the Defender.,5,"I bought a brand new 2015 LR2 HSE with lots of extras (navigation, roof rack, tow hitch).  Great car with truly unique looks.  Have gone on long trips (500+ miles) to Maine, no problems in cold, ice, snow, the occasional pothole and/or curb, etc.  Load up with surfboard and/or bikes, drives fine.  It's a high sitting SUV so absolutely no quick turning.  Handles very well in small parking lots.  It's a smallish SUV when you sit inside.  I use for myself mostly, but it can handle the family too.  Every time I pack it up, I think the luggage won't fit, but somehow it does.  If you have a few kids to move around a lot, it's probably too small.  We have just one and it works fine.  Would have upgraded to LR4 in a few years, but LR stopped production.  Tried the new Discovery Sport, and it's a glorified Honda CR-V.  If you want off-road, fine.  If you want on-road, that's OK too.  But, LR tradition and image is off-road, and the LR 2 & 4 replacement models are just not off road types at all.  Very happy with LR2.  Probably be a collector's item, as it's all steel framed (terrible gas guzzler), and has traditional LR suspension.  The new Discovery Sport is a sedan, so it's a car undercarriage with a bubble on top (like a Subaru Forrester).   I love my LR2; I've driven the Discovery Sport, RR Evoke, and RR Velar as loaner cars; I would never buy any of them.  Nothing unique; nothing special; nothing rugged about them. Those are trying to compete with BMW X series.  As a LR lover, I consciously want noting to do with a BMW x anything.  If you get a chance to buy an LR2, they are fun to drive, dependable, and good in congested areas.  If you live in a rural setting, it could feel small very quickly, but for tighter suburban roads, it's great.  With snow, absolutely NO quick turning.  Because it's a true LR, it has the traditional high front seats.  This provides unmatched vision for the driver.  The replacement models went with ""cockpit"" seating, which again is OK if you wanted it, but a ""cockpit"" has absolutely nothing, zero, zip to do with what most LR buyers are looking for.  Here again, LR just dropped one of it's key signature features to replace it with a run of the mill everyone is doing it type of styling for the driver.  Yuk.  LR2 is great car overall.   Shame they are stopping LR models.  LR buyers (like me) won't change into Discovery buyers.  They are very different vehicles... So, LR 2/4 buyers, maybe it's hello Tahoe, Land Cruiser, or luxury Wrangler (if they ever build one).  UPDATE: it's now over 50k miles.  still going great & drives very smoothly.   I've had no major mechanical issues.  small stuff, for sure, but the engine and basic parts are still working.  I have had the RR Evoke, the Discovery Sport, and the RR Velar as loaners.  All are inferior in one way or another to the basic & outdated LR2.  The Evoke is a Mini Cooper (clown car), the Discovery Sport seemed a bit ""tinny"" and the Velar is a sedan.  If you want an SUV, buy an SUV; the Velar is not an SUV.  I am hopeful that when the LR2 needs to be replaced in a few years, I can switch to the new Defender.  (If not, I'll look at a Land Cruiser, Yukon/Tahoe, or maybe a fully loaded Bronco if they offer one).  The boxy shape and solid construction are not present in the models I've tried at LR so far.  I'm not going to go from an SUV to a sedan.  I've tried a number of their sedans, and I just don't want a sedan.  I want the visibility, weight, power, and functional use of an SUV.  The LR2 is a great (small) SUV.   I'm hopeful that the Defender will be purposeful, useful, and practical (who cares about stylish and refined).  Example: if you get a flat tire on a trip to go skiing, you're going to need to change your tire, right?  If you drive those RR sedans, you'll be getting the spare tire that's located under the vehicle, totally unprotected, exposed to the road
 hazards, plus it's really cold out - enjoy!  Me?  In my LR2 I just open the trunk and there's my spare tire, safe, protected, dry, and easily accessible with all the tools.  That was a really smart decision decision that was amazingly practical.  Putting the spare out in the cold is standard procedure, but it's absolutely not optimal or even desirable. (Look what the G wagon does.  Does it put the spare on the bottom of the SUV?  The case is not just for show).   I've had 2 flat tires so far, so I have benefited from that design decision.

land-rover,lr2,2015,Javelin, 07/26/2016,Excellent SUV for long Road Trips,4,"Not long after we got our LR2, we took a long road trip from Missouri to Nova Scotia(Canada). No problems to report here and that was about 3k miles of road.   Our second road trip took us from Missouri to the west coast Seattle, Washington area and up to Vancouver, BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Canada. Coming back to the US through North Dakota and back to Missouri - the trip took 5600 miles!  No problems to report whatsoever. This SUV can accelerate when needed even with full-cargo in the back and four occupants; eg, coming out from a Rest Area and into traffic.  The braking is excellent.  I really enjoy this car's performance; when it's 100F outside and you have the AC on at full blast, I don't see/feel any noticeable engine performance degradation or lag...the car just go. Reliable SUV from personal experience."
land-rover,lr3,2005,bill4516, 10/11/2013,Overall a great vehicle!,4,"Bought a used 2005 LR3 V8 with 75,000 miles. Now just about to turn 100,000. Overall I love this vehicle and (knock wood) have not had any mechanical issues. Besides it's amazing appearance, it was cheaper than a used Tahoe 4X4. It rides very smoothly and has just the right amount of power. The a/c ( I live in Phoenix) works great. I'm hoping that it stays reliable. It hasn't however been problem free. The glove box door broke, the little door that covers the cigarette light won't stay up ( I don't smoke), the handle for the back storage area floor board came off and my side molding has come off twice. Once while four wheeling and once in a car wash (poor design). Still love the car! "
land-rover,lr3,2005,Will4516, 11/10/2015,The little things,4,"The ride, comfort and off road ability are amazing. It's the little things that are bothersome. All of these happened after 90,000 miles. Broken handle on glove box, broken radio button, handle on back storage compartment fell off, power front seat went out, drivers side power window button won't open back passenger side window, lost two rear exterior rocker panels in car wash and rear lift gate pistons went out. Not to mention the trip meter, gas mileage indicator, and miles till empty read out work some days and some days dont. At 120,000 miles this thing runs like it did at 50,000 miles. But the little things are incredibly annoying.

land-rover,lr3,2005,OoltewahLR3, 06/15/2010,Things to Look For in a Used LR3,4,"I bought this LR3 in 2008 when gas prices skyrocketed, and everyone was dumping their SUVs for better fuel economy. I bought a 2005 LR3 V8 with 30k miles for $20k with a full bumper to bumper warranty. Once I took it off- road with the dealership mechanics, I fell in love with it. I don't care that the sunroof leaks - at least not that much. If you buy one, make sure to buy it during a rain storm and drive it aggressively. That's when you'll notice a leak problem if there is one. Also - look for signs of leakage below the VIN number plate. There is a piece of paper below it (likely from the factory). If it is discolored, it is probably from one of those crummy sunroof drains. "
land-rover,lr3,2005,gr8song, 06/02/2011,Still holding on to my LR3,3,"In 2007, bought my 2005 LR3 used at about 45,000 miles and also bought very expensive extended warranty from Fidelity due to its bad reputation of reliability.

Ending up never needed the extended warranty. Never have had any major problems except a few minors like the rear window wiper and brake cable corrosion. The ""Check Engine"" light occasionally came on and was told by my dealership that I needed new battery more than a year ago. My local Interstate Battery store checked the battery out just fine, and I am still running with it. I did changed 4 brakes with brake rotors twice for the 4 years and 50,000 miles that I have owned it so far for almost $3,000 each time. That's expensive!!!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,jokawood, 08/02/2013,Can't find a better vehicle,4,"I use to go through vehicles every 2 years or less.
The first thing I look at when getting something new or thinking of getting something new is what compromise will I make when getting this?
I have owned my 2005 LR3 SEV8 since 2007 (when gas prices were high) and so far after 6 years of ownership I have done regular maintenance, changed the bushings in the suspension, thermostat housing, water pump, had all the recalls. You would do to any other vehicle just like an LR3.
But, I have NEVER had this vehicle leave me stranded on road or trail, never had an electrical glitch, or had a major issue.
Best vehicle I have owned and I would have to compromise to get anything else out there."
land-rover,lr3,2005,lisa123482, 10/30/2008,This truck talks the rest walk,4,"My Land Rover Lr3 now has 100,600 miles and going strong. I just out secound set of tires on it. I have had 2 alignments and finally one tune-up. Three brake jobs and nothing else. I just had a front Rover Winch installed and a Rover Push bar. I will drive this 05 LR3 to at least 200,000 miles. It's the most comfartable truck I have ever owned. I have changed all fluids and ready for the next 100,000 miles. I will still change engine oil every 5,000 miles and then junk the truck at 200,000 miles at which time well owe me nothing. At aprox. eight years old by then well have cost me about 7,000 dollars a year for the vehicle itself. This is a joke because if I keep it 10 years the cost well even be lower!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,kcslc, 10/12/2009,Warranty Only Please!,4,"My LR3 was a heartbreaker.  I just traded it in after only 18 months of use.  In that time it cost me nearly $1,700 at the dealer, and it was looking to need nearly another $1,200+ in work.  Air compressor died, keyless entry died, rocker mouldings fell off regularly, front axle bearing bad, undiagnosed HDC fault, pass door lock died.  This in a vehicle with 62,000 miles on it.  I average 20k miles a year and had more problems in 15k on this vehicle than any other vehicle I've owned!  If you can stand the maintenance, this is an awesome vehicle.  I almost kept it."
land-rover,lr3,2005,landroverjack, 01/29/2012,Purchased '05 in '10 (LR3SE),5,"I absolutely love this vehicle.
I've owned two 4-Runners, a Land Cruiser, an Audi and two BMW's.
This LR3 is far and away my favorite vehicle.
I will never own any other type of transportation.
Ease of use and it's generous driving proportions are a delight to the hands and feet.
I purposely sought one that did not have the navigation as they just a pain overall.
Especially when my iPhone can take me anywhere.... anyhow.
This vehicle has the cold weather package which I recommend if you live in the north.

I've been out in the boonies with this man-car a few times and have driven it cross country twice.
Did its duty and worked like a manly man car should.
I dig it."

This car has been in the shop more than it's been in our driveway! The LR3 was way over engineered. Keep the design and the luxury and get rid of the gizmos! Six computers? Come on guys! This car is so complex, the dealer couldn't figure it out! For example, the door locks lock and un lock at will. The stereo display will read total system shutdown, with the car running or not! All the dash lights will go out and the alarm will come on! On one accasion every warning light came on and the car quit and refused to start. Give me the car with a low range and a locking rear differantial and I would be happy. "
land-rover,lr3,2005,Brett Morey, 12/21/2009,2005 SE7,5,"Purchased this LR3 from a private party with all service records.  What a tremendous SUV.  Have owned a few MDX's and am new to Land Rover but thus far very impressed with the ride quality of this vehicle.  Honestly I expect that the cost of operation for this vehicle will be higher but the safety, features like Navigation and panoramic Sunroof with fold flat seats made this vehicle top on our list.  Whether it's a short trip to the store or a long drive up North we're thrilled to take the LR3 on an adventure."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Mtnplay, 10/30/2009,Would love it more without problems,3,"I bought one of the first LR3's. I love the vehicle, but I have had many problems. An undiagnosed HDC failure, and air compressor went out at 58,000 miles, rocker panels fell off in the car wash, now I have a yellow engine light on. They want $1000 to fix the HDC problem, and $1000 to fix the air compressor. I am replacing the battery this week to see if that resolves the engine light problem.  I absolutely love this vehicle for its looks, comfort,engine, and ability, however it could be built so much better. Would love to buy another one, but the dealer and Land Rover should have treated me better.  I now have 102,000 miles on the LR3, and I plan to drive it until it dies."
land-rover,lr3,2005,C.L.B., 11/24/2008,I'm in love all over again.,4,"Yep, just when I had given up on SUV's, along came LR3. I traded in my Mitsu Montero Ltd.(the full size one), for a Toyota Solara in '07. I wanted something sporty, fun to drive & good on gas. I got all of the above & had given up on owning SUVs. Then one day I decided to drive into a Jag dealership to take a look at the new Jag, when I saw a silver LR3. It was love at first sight. I absolutely love it. It has plenty of room for 7, handles & ride is A+, so many features, off-road A+, city & highway A+, luxury A+, my friends love it, complements all the time(could be because of the 22"" chrome rims), gas mileage, well, it's a SUV, but it's worth it. Heck, I have my Toyota when I need to save money."
land-rover,lr3,2005,texas retired, 10/08/2009,I love my LR3,4,"I bought my LR3 new and absolutely love it. I have had almost no issues with my SUV. There were a few warranty items in the beginning but smooth sailing now. It is about to go out of warranty and I am investigating extended warranty just in case. This is my second Land Rover, the last was a 2000 Disc II and I had no issues with it either. I keep hearing about reliability issues with these cars but I have not ever had an issue with the 2 I have owned."
land-rover,lr3,2005,kcslc, 11/02/2009,Heartbreaker,3,"I just ended an almost 18 month relationship with my LR3.  At the end, I still loved the style and comfort of the vehicle.  However, it's dreadful reliability finally won out.  In the time I owned it I fixed a suspension air compressor ($1,200), broken glovebox door ($250), broken keyless entry ($250), and rocker panel trim that fell off bi-annually. When I traded it in it had faulty HDC control, broken pass door lock, and worst of all a bad bearing in the front axle.  This was all between 47,000-62,000 miles.  On the plus side: good power, decent mileage for a V8 SUV (17+/-), real off-road ability, uniqueness, just right sized for my family. I'd own one again, but ONLY under warranty!"

Where can you find the spaciousness, On & Off road capability, safety, all weather reliability? No other competitor does it like the LR3! Purchased Certified to 6 yrs and 75,000 miles. Issues have been minor and covered by warranty. No suspension issues, ever. Tows up to 7716lbs with confidence. Handles up to 90 cu ft. of cargo or 7 full size adults! Replaced original battery at 53k! About to put third set of pads on frt.,rear o.k.! These units will operate to 300k, if you like. So, don't buy the poor reliability claims.

The LR3 has a huge cargo area and seats that fold flat quickly and easily. You can fit a six foot tall adult easily and comfortably in every seat. It's easy to see out of and park the LR3 because of its relatively small proportions and huge windows. Another impressive part of the LR3 is its extensive warranty and the dealer's service programs. The air suspension is a nice feature, because it means that the car can be low for access or higher for snow, towing, or off roading. This SUV feels solid, but suprisingly nimble on the road and in snow or ice sticks to the road like no other vehicle."

Nicely weighted steering and fabulous brakes. Quieter and smoother than the MDX by a country mile. It is true what the editors at Motor Trend said, "" 90mph does indeed feel like 55mph"". I didn't expect the gas mileage to be great given the vehicles mass but a little disappointed at 10.8 -11.4 mpg in city driving. The rear split gate design is a wonderful touch. And the third row is well worth if you have kids. It is superior to the Acura's in terms of comfort.  It is a quite different experience driving in sport mode. The truck feels much quicker than posted 0-60 times."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Amy Peterson, 01/06/2005,Love it so far...,4,"This is such a new vehical, the jury is still out, but so far it's terrific.  It drives like a luxury car, but it's so nice to sit higher in traffic.  It's so high-tech that there are features I know I won't use.  The third row seats are roomy and easy to fold.  When folded, there is a ton of cargo space.  When people are sitting in the 3rd row, there is little cargo space.  My kids think the best feature is the 3 sunroofs.  Great sound system too and very quiet ride too."

Also, lots of local driving and 2 Tahoe trips in major snow storms. From the silent ergonomic cabin, sturdy vault like build, crisp clear sound system & command style seating to the terrain response, navigation, & air suspension...each drive is an experience.  Driving to Tahoe in a major snow storm has never been more fun & stress free.  My wife loves the car & has never been more confident driving in bad weather.

The only HSE available was the floor model in silver/black interior. I traded my 2001 DiscoII SE7 and i'm so happy with the LR3. The vehicle is loaded with features and had everything i had in my old disco and then some. The LR3 has power, distinctive styling, comfortable and reliable.

After dialing in the appropriate setting, the best thing (and only thing you need to do is give it a little gas and steer. It goes anywhere effortlessly.

The old Discovery, of which I've had three, is positively prehistoric, by comparison. Without going into technical detail I can say that the ride, handling, dynamic looks and attention to detail are all first rate. In fact, I also test drove the Range Rover and preferred the LR3 hands down. The designers and engineers deserve the highest accolades for bringing the LR3 to market."
land-rover,lr3,2005,MARK HOWARD, 02/26/2005,Worlds finest SUV,4,"I read all the hype but I had my doubts so I went for a test drive. The salesman drove no more than 50 feet to the dealership test track which is rocky and narrow with tight, steep off-camber turns. I was amazed my wife was like a kid on a theme park ride. ""Let's do it again! Come on, let's do it again!""  One we headed out the drive way the controls were in my hands. My first impression was the comfort and drive feel of a large luxury sedan.  I had to have it and bought it that day. I could wait to get it off-road so I racked up the ""break-in"" miles in a couple of days and headed for the dirt.

Visibility is very good, especially if you fold down center rear seat. Sunroofs make the interior bright. Seating is very comfortable and roomy in every seat. Ability to lower the vehicle with one switch is very handy for shorter people & dogs to get in/out. Rear seats fold flat easily in many different variations. Transmission ""sports"" mode allows fast & easy merges with heavy city traffic. Very comfortable on long freeway rides"

week, can't decide whether it's a 
luxury sport utility or a rock climber- 
it does both so well.  Ride, quiet, 
refinement, power, ergonomics all 
superb, features are many and well 
thought out.  Quality seems excellent, 
no initial problems of any kind.  Feels 
solid as a rock, drives as quiet and 
smoother than our E320 Mercedes.  This 
car raises the standard way above 
anything else on the market, even the 
Range Rover!  Well worth the price, in 
fact a bargain.  "
land-rover,lr3,2005,LR3, 12/14/2004,"Problems with my LR3. 1,500 miles",4,"Great SUV to drive. Turns Head. But 
lately, there's been some little 
troubles with mine.

1) Loud rattle sound from rear upper 
tailgate over any type of bumps from 
big to very small bumps.

2) Driver's left side mirror won't 
work at times.

3) Driver's right side mirror - when in 
reverse the mirror automatically tilts 
down but when in Drive the mirror 
does not tilt back to 
the same position as it was before.

4) Cover for cigarette lighter would 
not close once opened.  I have to 
push lid around 13 times until the lid 
would stay closed.

5)  Radio:  When I turn on the radio, 
no sound will come on for about 1 minute.

I have gotten a lot of compliments 
about the styling.  My kids like it 
better than I do.  I have not gone off

 very comfortable like driving on air 
with big wide full seats
Owned 2 previous disco's which i 
always loved despite freq repairs; was 
totally psyched about LR3, funky, 
beastly, cutting edge technology
picked up SE blk/blk yesterday which

land-rover,lr3,2005,Kendall, 01/01/2005,My First New Land Rover In 30 Years,4,"I have owned at least 1 Land-Rover 
since 1974 when I bought a new Series 
III 88.  I vowed never to buy another 
new L-R as a used LR,RR or Rover sedan 
was,for me,a better value. 

The high-tech LR3 changed that.  This 
is the best one yet!  At this time, it 
is even more high-tech than the new 
RR. The interior retains features from 
the Range Rover Classic that were so 
popular in the P5 and P6.  The heated 
windscreen was first seen in the '67 6-
cyl L-R 109. Computer integration of 
engine,drivetrain,suspension, etc. is 
amazing! EAS bags are now protected 
from the elements. Navigation system 
is fantastic compared to 98 RR. WELL 
WORTH THE NEW STICKER PRICE! Best 
value of all new RR & LR models!!!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,Off Roader, 01/02/2005,Check Vehicle Carefully,4,"On the plus side, the LR3 provides the 
off road features of the Range Rover 
for a lot less.  Do not pay premium for 
HSE, SE with added options a much 
better bargain.  Do a thorough check of 
the vehicle for manufacturer defects 
and quality.  My car had a tear in the 
rear seat leather and numerous internal 
scratches consistent with dropped tools 
during manufacturing.  Rear parking 
assist didn't work upon delivery.  
Remember, you are buying a British made 
vehicle, not German or Japanese, so 
don't expect the same quality of 
workmanship.  Having said that, as a 
true off road type SUV it is the best 
on the market for the cost.  I also 
like the third row seating - much 
better than comparable SUVs."

Finally pulled them off tonight and the noise is gone.  Will keep you all posted."
land-rover,lr3,2005,micheal, 02/18/2005,A Great Land Rover,4,"What an improvement over the Discovery! This is a great truck; comfortable on long highway drives, able to get through the recent snowstorms in the Northeast, and up a very mucky 1/4 mile country driveway after the melting. We've put 7K on our SE, without a single problem (knock wood). It's versatile, fun to drive, and very well thought out. We tend to beat up our vehicles, and this one seems up to every task."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Anto, 03/13/2005,LR3 Fan,4," can't ever remember feeling so emotional about a SUV before, and I've had my fair share of machines.Both inside & outside, the LR3 reflects me in every way.  I just don't see myself in any other vehicle. At 6'1""-220lbs, I feel extremely comfortable inside. Being married with 2 kids, having a 7 seater is wonderful. Also being a business man needing trunk space comes in handy. I don't necessarily need the attention the LR3 gets, but it does make me feel nice. It rates in my books as one of the best looking machines on the road. "

I am shocked to say that I am enjoying the LR3 even more than the RR.  Very peppy ride.  So well thought out, esp. the seating design.  Can easily fit three boosters across in the 2nd row (caused bloody knuckles in the RR) not to mention the HUGE 3rd row. The entire cabin is light filled and airy.  The nav. system is definitely an improvement as is the in dash CD changer.  So sporty, I'm having a blast!"

Here in VA. we had a couple of snowy days and I put it through a test of what I need from an SUV and it handled great!!! For everyday driving conditions it is a fun, smooth driving experience. I didn't expect for an SUV to handle as well as the LR3 did, I mean when I'm driving down 95 switching lanes I feel comfortable and in control with not even a hint of swaying  I'm impressed. The Harman Kardon sound system is the bomb, and the sound is so richly toned and crisp like whoa!!! Great job Land Rover.                 "

It now has about 65,000 and I have to say overall I have been very fortunate. I've heard lots of things about reliability and to be honest and here my experience, tranny is starting to jerk a little when I slow down and speed up so I'm a little concerned but I bought the 6 year 75,000 mile warranty so we'll see whats up. I had to get the rear tailgate fixed...NOT CHEAP..latch broke and would not open. Also sunroof leaks out of overhead dome light... not covered under warranty.  BUT this thing rides like its on a cloud, and handles anything off road and looks are timeless. Overall I think I got one of the decent rovers and keeping it."

land-rover,lr3,2005,kwon303, 04/13/2008,Diamond in the Rough,4,"When I decided to buy this car I knew what I was getting into. Land Rover is known for off road greatness as well as luxury, but also very poor reliability. With that being said I still bought one and don't regret it. I love this car. I bought mine used because they depreciate so much that it just was not worth it for me. Not to mention you can find this car in L.A. at a dime for a dozen at a good price. I definitely got the extended 100,000 mile warranty to hedge my bet. Also you have to test drive it and check how it get out, transmission is key. No slips and your good to go also clean interior tells you everything you need to know. Gas is not great but what do you expect. Overall Great car."

I drove the range rover for two years and had zero problems and much admiration from my friends, this car(LR3) is so similar to it in the areas that matter. The differencs are few and far between little things that are mostly cosmetic and do not effect you on a daily basis. Off road driving is actually better, it's quieter, nimbler etc.. I can't recomend this car enough, period!"

Third row seat is a pleasure, best tailgate design ever, and confort beyond exspectation.  I understand that others have had trouble with a first model year, but that is typical and I was prepared for it (bought 100k bumper to bumper warrenty).  I have been off road with groups and solo and never been stuck yet.  The truck is truely more at home off road and my wife can still lean back an chat on the cell at the same time.  I even squeezed a larger set of tires on it and they worked great in sand"

Land Rover has done great things w/this new updated model. i've had it for almost 3 years & have zero problems w/it. It rides excellent & will dile you w/guilt if you don't take it off the road now & then. My wife had a Discovery & feel rest assured that you will have piece of mind w/this machine where as w/the discovery you just never knew.

It maneuvers well on all types of surfaces, from gravel to snow to icy conditions. It drives very much like the Range Rover, but for $23,000+ less. I gave up my fully loaded Mercedes ML430 for this, and have no regrets at all. Reliability is not yet known, as it is too new."

land-rover,lr3,2005,trm2, 01/31/2005,LR3 perfect so far,4,"The LR3 is powerful, safe, and spacious for a mid-sized SUV.  While the vehicle may turn out less reliable than some competitors, my experience so far has been delightful.  In a recent round trip from the Jersey Shore to Buffalo, NY, the vehicle performed exceptionally in both dry weather and driving snow, on ice and through slush.  I was able to maintain full control of the vehicle at a reasonable speed even in the worst weather, all the while experiencing the comfort and convenience of the vehicle's interior.  The only negatives with this vehicle so far are: the poor fuel economy (expected) and the lack of an 8-way driver's seat, which is inexcusable (esp. since LR promised it)."

It is rides smooth (like a Lexus), quiet (again like a Lexus), and handling is firm (like a BMW) both on and off-road - something most SUVs can claim. There were very minor problems when I picked mine up, but service corrected quickly. However, they should've done it beforehand. Not something you want to deal with when getting a new car. MPG is horrible, but already knew that beforehand. LRs has always been a favorite of mine, but always fell short of me getting one until now. The main reason is reliability. Hopefully, they corrected that or at least working on it. I'll see... "

After keeping the car for almost a month and mysteriously running up 250 miles on my car, I got my car back.  The car then would change height by itself.  They are still trying to it figure out. Lastly, the ride has this strange vibration which the dealer claims is due to the tires sitting overnight and should get better over time.  Go figure!!!  "

Incredibly fun to drive, great features. Only had it 6 days and can't wait to learn all the gadgets.  Terrain system far superior to the new Range Rover, and thus LR3 a better vehicle IMO."

It's fun driving the LR3, but I didn't have too many chances driving the LR3, because I end up driving the Freelander (the loaner car) more often. I paid $60,000.00+ to drive a freelander.  The LR3 was in the shop alot.  With about 8,000 miles on it. I ran into too many problems with the car.  I don't even feel like driving the LR3 long distances because I'm afraid it might break down on me again. Like the Air suspension, which broke twice already, maybe going 3. It rain today 4/28/05, and there was a leak from the glass roof at the 3rd row seats.  I'm just letting you know my problems so you won't have to go through what I went through."

A nagging vibration in the ride which the dealer claimed he could not feel.  The my entire electronic system malfunctioned.  The car spent the entire month of Feb. at the dealer.  Got the car back only to notice that it would change height by itself when in park mode.  After two more visits, I'm still holding my breath.  The vibration in the ride is still noticeable to me.  Oh, and finding a bag of garbage in the cargo area of the car after when I got the car back after one of many visits was not reassuring.  It's a beautiful car.  The veneer dash inlay for an extra fee is worth it.  All that glitters is not gold!!"

The hood latch required a minor adjustment, and a small rattle from the right rear of the vehicle disappeared when we adjusted and unrolled the cargo cover. Some minor tightening of screws was about all that was involved for the actual warranty work. The Java Black with black leather interior truly has an upmarket look and feel. Terrific to drive on dry pavement or snow and ice. No complaints. Finally an SUV with British manners, unique styling, and  go anywhere capability. With the exception of a Range Rover, nothing else to date seems to quite pack the panache of the new LR3 HSE! "

For $50K should be better esp. upon initial delivery.  I realize it's a LR which will be taken into the wilds but dings are acceptable new only on a Defender.  Drives comfortably but not sure if i'm confident enough to take it up to Bimmer speeds on A3 autobahn.  Still too new to review accurately.  Cross shopped with X5, XC90.  Nav system is intuitive but i've found systems such as the Portable Hertz ""neverlost"", easier.  Location of CD Nav player is ridiculous.  Not too concerned over the Logic 7; which carmaker really knows audio? Best in Class room."

In 10 months, it has stalled at least a dozen times, died and been towed to the dealer twice, locked out of the car with keys in hand in a snow storm, because electronic keys are faulty (twice) try to find the place to insert key  - it is covered with plastic and you must rip off molding. I have owned numerous cars and have had more problems with the 2005 LR3 then all combined.   When we bought it, we loved it for 1 month, then reality struck and the car is unsafe to drive by anyone and after all these headaches the dealer offered me $25,000 as a trade in on My $50,000, 10 month old LR3   Stay Away at all cost! "
land-rover,lr3,2005,SJB, 11/17/2005,Love our LR3,4,"We looked at and drove every 7+ passenger SUV before buying the LR3.  Our final choice was between the Lexus GX470 and the LR3.  Adults can actually sit in the rear seats of the LR3 and the seats fold completely flat and you wouldn't even know that they are there.  When they are upright they have a footwell.  I have more room in the back seats of my LR3 than my brother does in his Yukon and I'm pretty sure I could park my LR3 inside of his truck.  And that's really where the LR3 stood out for us.  I never feel like I'm in a truck.  The over the hood visibility is tremendous, the ride, while tight, is smooth and quiet.  We often get 20 mpg on the highway... on and on and on, we love the LR3"
land-rover,lr3,2005,F. A, 12/28/2005,Landrover LR3 HSE,4,"A remarkable vehicle that sets the benchmark for capable off-roading SUV with refined on-road capabilities.  Very ergonomic, has all of the features and more expected from a luxury SUV. If you want plush trim select another SUV e.g. Lexus GX 470. If you want a car with many intuitive features, without sacrificing the need for a ""go-anywhere"" SUV then the LR3 should be on the top of your test drive list.  The V8 is very adaptable and will not leave you wanting more power when you have to get out of the way quickly.  The terrain response is really neat and will help you avoid potential accidents.  A must in the colder northern US states."

I love this car but I've had repetitive problems with the air suspension and some other issues.  Unfortunately, despite mult. visits the suspension faults remain. Poor reliability on my particular vehicle (related to early build?. Also had the fuel tank recalled/replaced, susp. compressor replaced,  front speakers replaced (rattling), hood release cable replaced (failed), rear distance parking module replaced (failed).  And yet, I still would recommend this vehicle IF you buy a 2006/2007 and get the extended warranty.  Glad I bought the extended warranty!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,rs1, 03/24/2006,Gotta Like It,4,"Since I bought this vehicle I have gotten a lot of comments about it.  It is awesome to quote my kids.  It is a pleasure to drive.  The mileage is not great, but is what I expected.  Have slowed down a little on the highway in order to maximize mileage.  Not a real problem as the seats are comfortable and I enjoy the ride.  Average mileage has been 17.5 mpg plus with about 2/3 of miles on highway.  Everyone who gets in it likes how airy it feels with the rear moon roofs."

I have taken trips to Las Vegas and Mammoth from southern California. It drives like a champ on the highway and the snow. Very comfortable. I get 17+ mpg on long trips, 13 in the city. It feels like it was carved out of stone. Very comfortable. I have found the seats to be comfortable. Maybe my body type just fits. I see others have had trouble with the headrest position. I did not get the bluetooth, my only regret. I have the 5 seater and to date have not missed having the third row. Some say acceleration is slow. I've found using sport mode helps. If you want a hotrod SUV, go to the Cherokee SRT. "

Getting 14.8 in town and 22 on the highway at 75 MPH after minor mods. Holds 7 people no problem. Not much worse than our Honda Minivan. My wife loves it. Good complement to my Mini Cooper.
land-rover,lr3,2005,9k9, 06/03/2006,1st year status,4,The cooler is great but it will run down the battery.  We use it camping.  A queen air bed just fits in the back and the LR tent is great.  Gas mileage is not so good but we have a Fit for zipping about town.  We get suspension faults about once every three months but stopping and resetting the car clears it.  First trip was to LA from San Francisco down 5.  Cruising at 100 was like being in a jet in first class.  During last winter I hit patch of water about 6 inches deep at 50 mph.  The car was rock solid and carried straight through.  Off road it works well but be aware that steep slopes will cause you to have to reset it.

AND...the mirror casing and 3rd row seat latches have popped off and when searching for a coin I dropped the hardware under my seat was so sharp it cut a 3"" slit across my wrist. "
land-rover,lr3,2005,Erwin , 07/04/2006,Positive news,4,"This is my 13th Land Rover since 1987 and I can only say that the experience is getting more rewarding now the engine is ""loose"" and it really works like a gem. Interior feels great and works well and the profile of the car is a great design. The car feels solid and it navigates the Southern California freeways with ease. It is a perfect size for the busy roads. We have a 2003 Discover II (no problems whatsoever) and a 2003 Range Rover HSE in the garage. Other then the first Range Rover I never had any problems with the other Land Rover products. They are incredable vehicles, on road and off. Look forward to the new 2007 Range Rover as well. "
land-rover,lr3,2005,LR3Dude, 07/12/2006,21 months of experience - LR3 for sale,3,"I knew I was taking a risk.  My previous Disco II engine was replaced at 22K miles.  I have 14K on the LR3 HSE and no problems the first 6 mo.  Then everything broke loose.  First was electrical  every warning light went off when the LR3 was wet or below freezing, numerous sensors replaced, suspension faults, automatic door locks would open and close setting off the alarm (removed horn fuse), wood dashboard replaced, fuel tank replaced (recall), replaced fuel tank return hose disconnected and gallons of gas poured out on my driveway when I attempted to start the LR3 (my wife and kid had to step in the gas to evacuate), ash tray broke and awaiting parts, etc."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Combee1, 07/22/2006,"I want to love it, but it won't let me..",3,"I was so excited to get the new LR3 that I refused to wait for an HSE and bought a fully loaded V8 SE model, w/ navi, off-road, and 7 passenger seating. We have had problems with this vehicle from the start. Among them has been several suspension faults (requiring new air compressors), a bad seal in the exhaust system, leaking sunroof, recalled gas tank, bad sensor for cooling system, rattling speakers, broken lathces on seats and on glove compartment, and excessivlely quick and dangerously uneven tire wear. It often takes several trips to Matheny LR in Jacksonville, FL to fix each problem. Their behavior borders on rude at times, and they certainly do not stand behind their products."
land-rover,lr3,2005,rob, 08/09/2006,unreliable,3,I have owned my LR3 for 9 months and have been back to the dealership on numerous occassions.  I have had to replace broken components on the gas tank door.  I have had 3 recalls- they replaced the entire fule tank and internal components-they repalced the air compressors-they had to update software for a faulty ignition switch and I now have a water leak from the internal dome light.  I can say I agree with ALL the auto reviews that the LR3 is one of the least reliable autos on the market.  I had been a Nissan consumer for 10 years and I must say I can't remember a single problem with any of my past Nissian vehicles.  
land-rover,lr3,2005,SCEMARINO, 11/06/2004,What a Difference!,4,"I just traded in my 2003 Discovery for 
the new LR3 HSE.  Everything about this 
car is an improvement. It is so much 
easier and quieter to drive. More room 
and tons of extras - it will take me 
weeks to figure it all out! Glass roof 
lets in tons of light.  Seats are way 
more comfortable and the back seats are 
much improved too.    "

one of the best cars we have ever owned."
land-rover,lr3,2005,papillonpup, 11/16/2004,WOW,4,"What a difference from my old Disco. 
Waited for this one since the Auto Show 
and it was worth it. GREAT on-road 
drive but haven't had the heart to take 
it up to the quarry yet. Went over the 
test track at the dealership like a 
bump in the road."
land-rover,lr3,2005,MINISNMORRIS, 11/28/2004,On road off road it's a peach,4,"The performance of the LR3 is 
unsurpassed. Having been a past 
LandRover owner I thought it was just 
aDiscovery in new clothes. But it 
truely is completely new. It is heads 
above any other SUV on the new line up 
for 2005.The first bweekend we owned it 
we headed for the hills;my wife ,myself 
and 5 dogs.The fold down seats were 
perfect for them(the dogs not my 
wife,she insisted on sitting up 
front).My gas mileage was actually 
better than the ratings claim not much 
but still higher.The terrain response 
makes even the casual driver feel at 
ease in all types of driving.I think 
Land Rover has hit the nail directly on 
the head.It runs circlesaround the 
competition.DRIVE IT you'll LIKE IT."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Jo Jo C, 11/27/2004,Best Thing We Have Ever Done,5,"This must be the most advanced Land

the Discovery 3/LR3. Everything is 
just perfect, so well put together, so 
fast, and no normal person is buying 
this car to get good economy"
land-rover,lr3,2005,Anaheim Rover, 12/01/2004,Dealer support,3,"I bought a LR3 HSE about two weeks 
ago. So far, my experience has not 
been too good. I purchased the car on 
a Monday night, and the dealer said 
they needed two days to prep the car. 
I picked it up on Wednesday, and 
within minutes of driving off, noticed 
the Navigation System didn't work. So 
much for thoroughly prepping the car. 
This couldn't have been missed. It has 
now been two weeks, the car has been 
in the shop twice, and I am still 
waiting for, hopefully, the right 
part. We'll see. The dealer seems very 
interested in selling cars, but their 
customer care / support is terrible"

whatever you want. It's a pleasurable 
experience to own an LR3, if you own 
one, then you'll understand what I'm 
talking about; that's why the LR3 is 
rated ""the SUV of the year"" for 2005."

Great driving."
land-rover,lr3,2005,LR3 Lover, 12/31/2004,Love the LR3,4,"Just to be honest, I am happy with my 
Fully Loaded LR3 HSE w/ brush bar. Here 
are some experiences I had with my LR3 
right from the start to less than 3,500 
miles that I would like to share with 
you (Listed below): 

1) The drivers side door mirror 
wouldnt tilt up or down.
2) In Reverse, both side door mirrors 
will tilt but will not tilt back to 
normal positions as like before.
3)  Loud noises from upper tailgate 
when going over any size bumps, and 
when making turns.
4)  Sometimes, itll take over a minute 
for the radio to come on, or after I 
turned off the radio then on again.
5)  Suspension Fault.  Ive never 
driven the LR3 off-road, or even off-
curve (peoples most off-road exp)"

It's better than the Range Rover."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Craig Snyder, 02/07/2005,2005 LR3 SE,4,"Just purchased new LR3 this weekend.  I think it is an incredible vehicle, very heavy and sure footed.  Got a good deal from the dealer, they're starting to move off of the sticker a little now. Traded from a leased 2004 S60 which they bought out for me too!"

land-rover,lr3,2005,CapnCurry, 03/24/2005,Love my HSE,4,"Love this vehicle. My criteria was 1) had to have navigation, 2) good in snow 3) has good towing capacity 4) was a luxury SUV.  It met all of this in one nice package.  Believe it or not it's rated towing capacity is 7,700 lbs, that's more than a Hummer H2!  And the Jaguar engine is smooth and sweet.  This one is a keeper."

You may want your own personal mechanic when you buy this truck.  Good luck and maybe the 2006 model will be better, oh yeah, lose the Jaguar engine. Lots of power, no where to go but the shop."
land-rover,lr3,2005,MrMaster, 05/09/2005,'05 Tonga green with tan HSE,4,"Originally wanted a silver HSE, realized availability issues;  found a Tonga green due for delivery and not yet spoken for. I'm really happy with the color combo we got (tan interior) and actually feel it looks better than the silver, due to the freezer-box shape of the vehicle. Added a brush guard, door guards, and rubber mats."
land-rover,lr3,2005,klebsack, 05/23/2005,Land Rover is tops,5,This is a truly awesome vehicle. This is the first LandRover I have owned but will not be the last.  It is fun to drive and exceeds my expectations of an SUV.  I drove it on a LandRover course and was amazed at what it is capable of. It was definately a thrill to see it's manuverability on an off road enviroment.
land-rover,lr3,2005,Phil, 05/24/2005,"Trust me Buy it, I did",4,"I live in Germany and travel on the autobahn daily at over 125 mph. I would challenge any other production SUV to come close to the performance of this one.  This truck is a sports car with room to spare.  It is in a class by itself, trust me I have drive every other SUV from the X5, to the M class, the Volvo and the Explorer.  This one is the best.  Any you have to see the way the seats all fold into the floor independently."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Bannerzap, 05/25/2005,Better than Expected,4,"This is a great vehicle.  The offroad capabilities are superior, comfort is great, GPS is really nice, and the air suspension is just plain cool to use.  I find a new feature every day on this LR3.  I'm glad I spent (leased) the extra money to get the HSE because the memory seats, 500+ watt stereo and rear stereo controls are really sweet.  Makes a Grand Cherokee look like a toy compared to this monster."
land-rover,lr3,2005,TN-LR3, 06/03/2005,Excellent Vehicle,4,"The LR3 is a comfortable and powerful SUV.   It does so many things well.  It is filled with high tech edges and can go anywhere, any time in style and grace.  It is not cheap, but if you compare it to its competitors, it is a far better option."

land-rover,lr3,2005,amf, 06/17/2005,One Big Problem,4,"Big Problem : This is our family's third Land Rover. A Discovery in 1994, another Discovery in 1998. We loved them both and loved our Service Manager. We needed more power to pull a trailer, so in December we took delivery of a fabulous LR3, V8, HSE. Fabulous except for one thing that makes driving, especially long distance driving, really miserable: the driver (and front passenger) headrest is slanted forward at a really uncomfortable angle. No matter where the seat itself is positioned, the headrest is tilted so that the driver's neck is bent forward; it is impossible to sit up straight and have your back, neck, and head rest comfortably. Check this out before you buy or lease !!!"

land-rover,lr3,2005,John, 06/20/2005,Love this SUV!!!,5,I love this SUV!  It can not be compared with other mid-sized SUV's becasue it's not.  Not inside anyway!  Our LR3 seats 7 large adults totally comfortably...even more comfortably than the Suburban....the biggest of the SUV's.  But outside you wouldn't know it.  The turning radius is just amazing as well.  Parking is a sinch!
land-rover,lr3,2005,Kristen, 06/20/2005,Love my Rover!,4,"My husband bought me this car soon after we had our baby in December.  I couldn't love it more.  It's got amazing handling and pick up.  The steering is incredible.  It's full of cool offroad features that you can even use on road.  I use my ""snow"" setting in stop and go traffic."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Michael Stoll, 06/20/2005,LR3 & ME!,4,"In this case, the fourth time is a charm! Following a Discovery and two Range Rovers, I think they've finally got it! Rides like a luxury car, stable on ice and snow, and all the bells and whistles you would expect, save the comment noted below regarding sound system. While hesitant in the past, I would give the LR3 two big ""thumbs up""!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,chazfresh, 06/20/2005,Very Nice,4,"The truck is great so far. Many more amenities than the competitor. The statement that it only comes with a V- 8, is incorrect. We just bought the 6 cylinder SE model. Very comfortable. Quiet, and a smooth ride. I found that the sales people are all but useless. Read the owner's manual. This truck has way more than the dealers know about."
land-rover,lr3,2005,BinacoInc, 06/20/2005,Best Ride Ever,4,"I love this car. The only thing we do not like is that it has no protection from dents, no side molding. This is the best riding vechicle I have ever driven and I have owened some very nice cars."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Vivina, 06/20/2005,My LR3,4,"This our first Land Rover, and we founded to be excellent suv, It takes curves beautifully.  We are very pleased with it, we drove to Florida over the spring holiday and its very comfortable and roomy."

land-rover,lr3,2005,LandRover LR3, 06/20/2005,Love my Landrover,4,"Overall we couldn't be more pleased with this vehicle. It demands attention. The dvd player they installed is probably my only complaint. We have already brought it in for service..but that has nothing to do with the actual car. We have three little children and they learned how to put the seats up and down quicker than I did. The trunk space is a bit small when the the third row is up...but is still manageable. It is roomy, elegant, and worth every penny. The air conditioning vents are supplied throughout the car...and lots of cup holders. Great for the kids and great for my husband and I when we have a night out together.  We will forever be Landrover owners."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Chuck McKibbin, 06/21/2005,Best of the Best,5,"I have owned many SUV's and many, many vehicles. This is the best I have ever owned.  It will climb impossible peaks in Arizona, then hit the highway at a smooth 90 m.p.h.  Everything has been well thought out and user friendly and this truck has PERFORMANCE."
land-rover,lr3,2005,PlaneIce, 06/30/2005,I love this SUV,4,"I have drove several SUVs BMW X5, Yukon/Tahoe , Lexus lx470 and 330, but to honest the LR3 was really the most comfortable and the most head turning, it full of all the gadgets you would expect and would like to have it this rang of SUVs, I just love it."
land-rover,lr3,2005,pgf27, 07/17/2005,"Excellent Truck, did I mention Excellent",4,"Wow is a good word for this truck. I traded my Infinity 2003 loaded QX4 for this, not really wanting to, and I tell you I am so glad I did. This SUV has the engine to back it's size, so it actually moves like the cargo area isn't even full.  The creature comforts are there, just keep in mind it is designed to be a TRUE off road vehicle, so some standard features like auto lights are not a part of this car.  I've been over several terrain types, and the trucks program selection for off roading made the truck handle things easily (Like curb climbing, etc). The vehicle does use gas like any suv, but I am definately VERY happy and always excited to climb in for a drive!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,Colt45, 07/27/2005,Fun to Drive - - - When Not In the Shop,4,"My LR3 has spent more time on the road than on the road - - 3 weeks so far. (With 2 weeks parked while on vacation, and 2 weeks actual driving it.) - - There was paint peeling from the front bumper and the nav system isn't working properly. My local dealer has been excellent. I'm hoping LR will figure out what's wrong. I enjoy driving the LR3 during those times I've had it on the road. Sigh, maybe it'll be out of the shop by next week - - Week 4. "
land-rover,lr3,2005,Bammer, 07/29/2005,Missed some details....but a great truck,4,"I've had my LR3 for four months, having traded in a Range Rover.  Overall I'm happy with the car, but there are some ponderous details they overlooked, like you have to hold the wipers away from the window while washing.  You need three hands to wash the windows.  The lack of front tilt on the seats is ridiculous as has been mentioned before.  I've added mud flaps because the wheel wells don't catch anything the tires run through.  The black door panels ""chalk"" in less than a week, turning a whitish hue which no amount of cleaning seems to stop.  The radio accessory plug in the rear of the center console????  I carry my iPod in front not in back, so I had to snake a cable to the front."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Sunridgefarm, 08/04/2005,I got a Lemon,3,"I have had my LR3 for 8 months and it has already been in the shop for over 50 days.  First a bunch of lights went on for no apparent reason, the shop had my car for over a week.  Then I took it in for its 7500 mile check and the next day it started to surge forward then the engine would die.  That took 3+ weeks to fix (new fuel tank). I got the car back and within 3 hrs. the engine light went on.  Another 10 days and a new feul pump, the service manager took it home to test it and the light went back on. Finally got my car back and within 24 hours the check engine light is back on.  I have had it and am filing a Lemon Law claim."
land-rover,lr3,2005,KandG, 08/04/2005,LR3 HSE7,4,"We cross shopped the BMW X5 4.8is, X5 3.0 (0nly one with a manual) and Volvo XC90 V8.  LR3 won out over others for features at price point and legendary capability of the marque.  So far so good.  Mileage has been better than average (approx 19.7mpg) LR3 is very stable at triple digit speeds on the autobahn.  Utility, versatility and ergonomics are great.  Steering feel is perfect and not overboosted like the Volvo.  Only wishes really are for a manual tranny, cloth seats/rubber mats (leather is too much to upkeep) and Tdi options stateside.  Navigation could have better input control such as a column stalk/selector.  Touch screens tend to get tedious. Voice Command is really unnecessary. "
land-rover,lr3,2005,Jeff, 08/08/2005,Just Perfect,5,"After three Mercedes MLs, it was time for a change. The MLs kept getting better (1998, 1999, 2001 models) but were nowhere near as good as the LR3. The  LR3 is incredibly solid, with smooth acceleration and a great ride. Interior comfort is excellent and the kids love the third row, which offers easy access. Winter driving in New England was never better, with the LR3 handling snow and ice in a way that can only be described as awesome. Yeah, I like the LR3 a lot."
land-rover,lr3,2005,grendal_fly, 09/06/2005,Great Choice,4,"We also shopped the BWM and the Volvo, but in the end we wanted a SUV with lots of interior room that you could actually park in a normal garage. Outside of the poor gas mileage this delivers almost everything you can ask for in the price range."
land-rover,lr3,2005,mpn1, 09/20/2005,"LR3 - good, but....",4,"Had several stops to dealership after 2 stalls, rear sensor fail, and 2 engine faults ( one caused by gas cap!) I like the ride, and am trying to really feel comfortable about the purchase, but the reliability issues keep me from getting too attached..."
land-rover,lr3,2005,LRSC, 10/19/2005,Glad we bought it,4,"We are very happy with the LR3. It hauls our sail boat, take us off road to remote camp sites and gets us to the snow in comfort and style. The interior is very comfortable and suits our taste. We find the third row seats to be useful and comfortable for adults.  It has been in the shop twice.  The first involved a failed rear locker. The dealer's response was excellent. They swapped a rear end from an LR3 on their lot and got us back on the road within a couple of days. The second failure was a compressor. It was on back order but was fixed as soon as it arrived. No other problems.   If it continues to run well we will be happy. We plan to keep it for a long time."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Bruce Brown, 11/02/2005,Outstanding Car,4,"The LR3 has the versatility I need in a family car with the smooth and solid ride of a luxury sedan.  The Jaguar 4.4 liter engine is quiet and strong enough for this heavy car and the transmission is flawless.  The interior is perfectly designed, with the distinctively high Land Rover seating position and elegant controls.  Both the second and third row have more usable space than any other car or SUV in this class -- I can fit three car seats in the second row and two adults in the third.  Zero service problems after 6K miles. You should not expect this heavy and solid car to get good mileage and, alas, it does not.  But other than that understandable shortcoming, this is a terrific car."
land-rover,lr3,2005,UnbrknCh8n, 11/29/2005,"An awsome vehicle, on-road and off",4,"I had some fear about buying the first year of the LR3.  However, with almost 25,000 miles on my truck, it has performed flawlessly (except for the tires, but that's another story).  It is wonderful off-road, smooth on-road, stops on a dime, and is fun to drive. It truly does seat 7 adults, and the fold-flat rear seats are very useful. The terrain-response really does work (I've tried it in mud, snow, sand, and on steep, rocky trails).  If you are not ever going to off-road, there may be cheaper SUV's, but if you spend any time driving on anything other than dry pavement, it can't be beat!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,aesko, 11/30/2005,Better than the Discovery by a mile,4,"Purchased as a demo model, so it had a few miles on the odometer. We have previously owned a 95 Discovery, and a 02 Freelander. Land Rover seems to have done its homework this time. The overall fit and finish is far superior to LR's previous offerings,and the 300 hp on tap is just about right. For a SUV this size it handles great. However I'm not so sure about the  durability of the electronics. Overall we are quite happy with the purchase of this vehicle, however LR could have done a few things better, the third row should have come as a no cost option, and the lack of a SIRIUS radio system is well just dumb. I mean GM offers XM on even its base cars. I hope it holds up better then its previous offering"
land-rover,lr3,2005,Happy LR3 owner, 12/03/2005,The best SUV in its class,4,"Pros:  The new style, technology, on-road and off-road capabilities, and gadgets in general far exceed its competitors.  Not to mention, the outstanding, complimentary service for the first 45,000 miles.  I've been to two dealerships in different states.  The service is excellent.  Cons:  This SUV is the quintessential ""gas- guzzler"".  Note:  I have clocked approximately 20,000 miles since May.  Therefore, I expected to meet or exceed 30,000 miles before May, 2006.  Yes, I know high mileage does not help vechicle resale value, but I enjoy driving the LR3.  "

Big improvements over the Discovery Series II I owned for 6 years and put 183,000 miles on.  I loved that car. It was time for a change. The LR3 is landrover's way of saying we listened.  The ride, the interior, the 3rd row seating show vast improvements from the series II. The turning radius is awesome and I trust the cars safety record to protect my family.

The truck handles well for an SUV, and I have had most. The gas mileage is the only negative quality, but you are towing a great amount of weight daily...Kudos to the LR3!"
land-rover,lr3,2005,Rod, 03/02/2006,No one comes close,4,"Beautiful driving experience, out of all my vehicles Ive owned including other SUVs this is the best built, ride and handling of all. Makes me just want o get in and go for a ride no destination in mind. Ride comfort is accentuated when you feel as if all your troubles have been left outside the minute you close your door. The sound system is spot on, clear and very relaxing. There is no outside road noise to disrupt your travels, even in traffic jams I feel relaxed, compared to my previous vehicles this is like sitting in a sound proof room. My children love the seating layout and the sound system connect"
land-rover,lr3,2005,Janet & Dave, 04/03/2006,Love it so far...,4,"We have been a long time Jeep family (owned 4) and were looking at the Commander.  For the same price we were able to get a 2005 new LR3 - no comparison!  The ride is amazing, the level of service from the dealership second to none, and the third row is extremely comfortable.  I am 6'2, 240 and have ridden in the 3rd row - I can't do that in any other SUV in this class.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a comfortable, luxurious vehicle, whether an SUV or not."
land-rover,lr3,2005,maciosaig, 06/14/2006,Land Rovers best,5,"The LR3 has been nothing short of excellent. Its on-road performance is excellent for what it is. Off -road it surprised me, I do a fair amount of medium to difficult off-roading and the LR3 has not let me down yet. I use the LR3 to commute every day, so I wish it had a diesel engine option like the rest of the world has available. I hate the complicated voice activated navigation, it has difficulty understanding alot of commands, especially when asking it to find Italian restaurants. The off-road part of the nav system is excellent and very technoligically advanced. Passenger comfort is great and cargo hauling is excellent. More aggressive tires and manually locking diffs are needed"

Many times the onboard computer has affected the ability to drive, to raise and lower the vehicle, to operate the radio, and most importantly to shift. I should have known that the electronics would live up (or down) to their reputation."
land-rover,lr3,2005,David , 07/28/2006,No regrets whatsoever!!,4,"I bought my LR3 SE recently from a used car dealership who posted the car on eBay. I had CARCHEX.com review the car before the purchase and shipment.  I saved about $10K than if I had bought it at my local Land Rover dealership. The car is the envy of my friends, neighbors, and colleagues. I love the navigation, the large spacing, power and handling, and the amazing internal and external styling. The mileage is a definite issue; however I leverage my old car during the weekdays, i.e. for going to work. I drive my LR3 primarily on weekends, i.e., dinner date and going to church. This way I save on gas as well as preserve the value of my vehicle. "
land-rover,lr3,2005,ADM HALSEY, 08/10/2006,Hot fun in the summertime,4," So far, this vehicle is all it can be. The steering and brakes are excellent, ditto for overall handling & response at all speeds.  The sweet spot for maximum MPG on the highway is around 66-67 mph - I have cruised to the tune of 22.7+ MPG. Just don't drive like a fool around town and you may inch to 16 MPG.  Nothing major to take issue with, aside from petty annoyances that were more than answered on the web site - excellent training videos for all aspects of the car.  I came to aquire this car through a series of fortunate events, had I paid the full $62,000 I might be singing a different tune.  I have driven many vehicles since 1970, now I get it about LR. Nice car if you can afford."

Mileage 14/18 (for 3 1/2 tons) but tired of hearing people complaining that it doesn't get the same mileage as their previous economy car. Duh!

The car did so well in the crash that I couldn't get the driver's insurance company to total it.  The side curtain airbags worked like a champ, and since it will take 3 months to repair it, and I don't want to drive a near totaled car, I bought a 2006 LR3 and plan to sell my old one when it comes back from the body shop.  I took a client out last night (CEO of a company), and he couldn't believe how well made the car was.  I am thinking of selling my wife's suburban and buying a third onefor her."

Dealer fixed it all and I had a loaner but it took two trips to get it right.  Then developed a interior water leak, again took two trips to fix.  Land Rover US customer service has high school girls with an attitude answering the phones, no help.  The car is actually tremendous which makes this very sad.  Great ride, quite, great stereo, good gas mileage, super style, excellent off road.  Everyone that rides in has nothing but compliments for it.  Just make sure you love your dealer because it is built in England and they like to drink before they come to work."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Frustrated LR3 Owner, 11/06/2006,very poor quality & reliability,2,"I really want to like my LR3. It just won't let me. I've had the transmission replaced (after it shut down my ABS, stability control, dropped the suspension to where it looked like a low rider), the alternator & battery (after it shut down my vehicle while it was still driving), and had a water leak fixed early on. Now I have water coming in from just about everywhere possible.....great quality"
land-rover,lr3,2005,Ted, 01/03/2007,Looks great in the shop!,2,"Transmission failure, suspension failure, rear differential replaced, water in front head lamp, water leaking into cabin from sunroof, water collecting in floor boards, e-brake failure, right rear break 'shattered', leaking oil from oil filter connection, recalled gas tank, faulty coolant indicator.  That's 12 issues in a little over a year of ownership, and there are other smaller issues as well.  If my LR3 qualified for the Lemon Law (under 15k in mileage) I'd return it.  Given previous issues with the Discovery I would not spend money on a Land Rover again.  The quality is just not there.  At this moment it's being fixed again, then it will be traded in, not for another LR."

We drive from LA north for 200 miles and back again frequently.  We have found that this car is a delight to drive both in the city and the country where we need the 4 wheel drive.  It zips around the city and really does climb the slippery muddy roads on our property.  I feel very safe in all sorts of driving situations.

land-rover,lr3,2005,Pamela, 03/11/2007,frustrated,3,"This by far is the best looking SUV in its size, but have not had it since Jan 21 due to electrical problems. It was in the shop 3 times before this last one, a total of 4 times in 6 months. It has been in the shop for a total of 67 days as of today. The service department can't figure it out. It goes into crash mode while driving down the freeway. This means hazards light up and won't turn off, locks constantly lock and unlock, all service lights on the dashboard light up and the suspension drops no matter how fast or slow you are going.  They have replaced the CPU and harness, and check all circuits, it still has the same problem. I will sell it when I get it back."
land-rover,lr3,2005,Arch North, 05/01/2007,It's not just the cupholders,4,"We love our LR3 just because it's a great car to drive. It's unbelievably smooth on the highway due to the air suspension, and a push of a button raises it for off road driving. The engine barely makes a sound when it's idling, and is matched with the transmisson so nicely that you barely feel feel it shift. The sound of the engine under accelleration is symphonic!  We've owned the car for about a year and a half now, and still feel like we're going on vacation every time we get into it."

Alarm goes off randomly, doors lock and unlock selves as radio goes off and on (keys not even in car.) Sunroof leaks. Poor winter traction, especially when braking. Windshield heating element distorts vision at night. Brights activated accidentally with turn signal use, rear wiper, when working, activated accidentally when using windshield wipers."

This vehicle is built for the moon terrain and it will get you there in supreme comfort.  It's had its share of recalls, failures, and tweeks but when you are driving the ""first of"", you can't beat the construction, performance, and charm this ""Rover"" has.

I only drove the LR3 for about maybe a mile on test drive, and liked it but was strange feeling. Later after purchasing it that day the more I drove the more I loved the LR3! Then when did my first road trip to visit family, there is a lot of passing power on highway and for hills, the top was not heavy so it didn't lean bad at all, w/ 50/50% (close to) weight ratio there is not any under or over steer!

If it can't go over the hill, it will flatten it.  Great cargo room and the best family car hands down.  Opt for the HSE.

land-rover,lr3,2006,Zak P., 03/24/2016,10 years and still loving my LR3.,4,"The key is to find a good independent Land Rover repair shop.  Trips to the dealer repair shops may end up with follow up visits to repair other failing or failed items...in my case.  Started going to an independent LR repair shop in Bellevue, WA, and doing most of repairs myself, and I have not had any issues for several years (knock on wood).  If you air suspension goes out, consider investing in a coil/spring conversion.  Kits range between $1500 and $900; once completed, you'll never have to worry about failing air suspensions...but the air suspension cool factor is gone.  Get a tow hitch kit and you'll never need a pickup truck; just rent a utility trailer to haul your dirt or whatever suits you.  I'm having a hard time deciding on a replacement for the LR3.  Options have come down to...another Land Rover...LR4, RR Sport, or the full sized big boy RR. UPDATE...I'm now over 230,000 miles...so far so good...""knock on wood""...aiming for 300,000 miles.

So I moved forward and purchased it and I could not be happier!  My car has 60,000 miles on it now, I did in fact have an issue with the sunroof, and it was fixed about a year ago, it took a little bit but they did get it!  I only care about the performance and the fact that my car runs like its brand new! In swear by my LR3, and think that sometimes we all run into a lemon as I did with one of the five Grand Cherokee's I leased.  I would never buy a Chrysler at 30,000 your car starts to fall apart.

I couldn't be happier with my LR3!  It is everything it is supposed to be, commanding driving position, fantastic view from any seat (the windows are quite large and allow you to look out and down since they go lower than most vehicles.  I'm not tall but some of my friends are and there is so much head room you will never have to recline the seat to avoid hitting your head.  For a 6000 pound vehicle it drives more like a normal sedan, brakes are very strong (I can't even compare them to my old xterra, the LR3 is in another league), the 4.4l jaguar engine is strong and always seems to have a little more power when you need it.  The front and second row seats are large and comfortable, the fold flat third row are probably the best third row seats out there, and adult can use them and they aren't bad... I would compare them to a compact car back seat.  The only down side is repair costs are high and I do repairs myself, but parts can be costly too.  Fuel consumption is whats to be expected for a vehicle of this weight and I am only averaging 9-10 mpg with city driving (we only drive 5 miles a day average with this).  I did a little highway driving and got about 13 mpg.  That being said I honestly don't care about the fuel consumption because I love this vehicle so much that it is completely worth the added fuel cost.  The security and safety for my family is worth it.

The build quality is fantastic, tight, sound and poised; simple, yet elegant.  If you have been thinking of buying the Lexus, Acura, or Mercedes, do yourself a huge favor and test drive the LR3.

I now have over 20000 miles on it, and no problems. I average about 17.5 mpg in mixed driving. The 3rd row is more tolerable for adults on short trips than my previous Acura MDX.

But for the money, there are so many quirky things that go wrong, the tire pressure guage is faulty, had an issue with brakes, the issue with water coming in the car from the sunroof, etc. It is a solid car, but Costco is the only jungle I'm headed to. Too many off road features and not enough attention directed to designing a slick, ergonomic cockpit. Way too many buttons, and the nav totally stinks. A paper map is more useful.  My Acura TL has a nav that blows this away.  I'll be turning my lease in in 2 months and not getting another."

The SE7 can fit 7 comfortably.  The options work well and the window space provides great views and visibility.  The footprint is not so large like a Tahoe etc so its easier to park and maneuver.

I suppose Repairs can be expensive but contrary to what I had heard, the durability and dependability of this vehicle has been amazing and I have a fully optioned HSE. Only normal maintenance has been necessary. I was a Jeep Lover and this is the evolution of off-road prowess and luxury in one package. Low center of gravity due to the aluminum body which is tough as nails, despite appearing top heavy it is not. The capability of the LR3 is awesome. Everything inside is well thought out without compromise. It turns heads everywhere I go. I have had 100k+ Porshe's that didn't have the social panache and fun factor of the LandRover at half the price. Nicest daily driver I've ever had. Looks, drives and feels like it did when new inside and out and after 10-years of motoring fun I still love this vehicle. The LandRover attracts admiration without the sneers I use to get in the Porsche. Until Rolls Royce and Hummer collaborate on an SUV, I can't imagine driving anything else.
     After listening to everyone telling me to get rid of my LR3 (now 150k miles) I sold it. Worst mistake ever. It was still solid and probably would've ran another 10 yrs or more and I gave it away for wholesale value. What was I thinking.

Some improvements were made, but other changes were steps backward. It's MUCH smoother on the pavement due to a less stiff suspension, but the 4.4L 300HP engine (while zippy in passing performance) has a 1-2 second lag between the time I step on the gas and the time it actually responds. My 4.6L 217HP Disco SE has already taken off like a rocket while the LR3 is still thinking about it. Very quiet inside - the engine is nearly silent. I don't like that the LR3 SE trim is more industrial (and less ""classy"") than the Disco SE. Overall performance is great, but little tweaks were missed."

There are cheap plastic pieces that cover the front seat tracks affixed to the floor that have cracked in various places, kinda cheap. I have to agree the gas mileage is far from ok, likely $100 to $150/wk in gas. tons of space in the rear w/o the 7 seater, lots of headroom and cabin space. A good friend of mine had his LR3 declared a ""lemon""?? Be wary!"
land-rover,lr3,2006,hidlebac, 08/17/2009,The standard in 7 seater luxury SUV's,4,"It is solid, heavy, and safe. I feel comfortable when wife is driving it with our daughter. It is a solid car, with a slick, ergonomic cockpit. Lots of buttons but they are very thoughtfully placed. The Nav is great.  I would recommend a nav update DVD from Navteq for people who still have the original software. It makes things alot better."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Katie, 01/18/2006,My LR3 makes me happy!,4,"I test drove other SUV's and none come close to the elegant feel of the LR3.  It is hip, cool and exudes confidence.  I also like the fact that no one else in my neighborhood has one, but that will probably change since I keep getting so many compliments.  The turning radius is so cool and I love the look of the front end and overall styling.  Land Rover does a beautiful job of designing something truly unique among all the cookie cutter SUV's out there.  I feel good when I'm driving my LR3 and feel safe too.  Great combination!  I love this truck!!"
land-rover,lr3,2006,jclay1965, 06/14/2006,Love/Hate Relationship?,4,"After pondering the decision to buy a LR3 V8 HSE after renting one for a week in California last year, finally got around to doing it this week. I can already tell it will most likely be a love/hate relationship. Right out the door, had to bring the LR3 back to the dealership the very next day, as there was some noticeably bad wobble/vibration coming from one or more of the wheels/tires. Also the seat memory switch  #1 was DOA. While it was in being fixed, apparently the check engine light came on, and they fixed that as well, after running an 'engine diagnostic'. I love the car, but we are off to a rough start. The dealership, on the other hand, is fantastic!"

land-rover,lr3,2006,Dave P., 02/06/2016,Bought for the third row,2,"Bought this primarily for the usable third row. At the time no other vehicle had one like it. We were moving to an area where a vehicle able to haul 7 adults comfortably in any weather or terrain was useful. 
Other than that I feel the vehicle was overpriced, definitely unreliable until it had been in the shop for four months fixing everything wrong with it from the factory. Luckily that was under warranty, after warranty is gone you can bet on dropping a couple grand a year easy on maintenance if not more. Break jobs which it needs frequently because the damn thing is so heavy are very expensive if your not mechanically inclined enough to do your self which I am not. 
Overall it was an overpriced tank I put around my family to keep them safe, it did that but I would never buy another one. There are too many lower priced and more reliable alternatives available today.

When I pull a 5500 lb. trailer, I get around 12 mpg - not bad!  Bad news - Dealer ""forgot"" to replace the fuel tank, caused a transport to have it replaced.

Currently has over 245,600 miles and still rides as smooth and strong as it did in 2008 when I bought it with 32,000 miles.  Normal brakes, belts, tires, battery and oil changes. Only other maintenance has been, temp sensor, thermostat, air suspension compressor, MAF, and hatch cable, but they were all pretty minor DIY items. Radio and navigation recently went out due to mouse. Trying to find problem.

I bought it because I really liked the new styling inside and out and the more powerful engine, but didn't take into account the fact that it would be even less reliable than the 2003 Disco II that I traded in (which is really saying something). In my time owning it, I was at the dealership several times for the ""check engine"" light (not gas cap related), a total electronic malfunction (it said the e- brake was engaged when it wasn't and would't start for a full day), as well as a few other annoying issues. Overall, a miserable ownership experience.   "

So far the LR3 has been great. No issues. The LR3 is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. I have done multiple long road trips and multiple off road trips. The only drawback to the car in my opinion is the fuel, but what can you do about that with a V8. I have also done moderate towing (other cars on trailers and boats) and the LR3 handles it well.  It's only 2 yrs old so we will see how it holds up in the long run."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Jamie, 02/16/2006,Excellent SUV,4,I just purchased the LR3 HSE and it is the best SUV I have ever had. We just had a blizzard in the Northeast and this car did not even flinch. It feels extremely safe and it so much fun to drive.  It has so many great features that other SUV's don't have. I would recommend it to anyone.

There's been 2 or 3 items to deal with during the 42K miles, but the dealers have taken excellent care the entire time. I have clients that all drive high end cars and just can't stop raving about the LR3's. 5 stars!"

LR does not tell you about the TSB on its tires until after you chew through your first set at about 15K.  I am on the second set of $1000 tires and they are going bald in the back at 34K.  The vehicle is too expense to replace tires every year.  Not isolated, see class action lawsuit against LR.   "
land-rover,lr3,2006,Darley, 04/27/2009,LR3 Review,3,"This truck is driven mostly as a family shuttle and grocery getter.  But there's the occasional roadtrip up and down the east coast, when I really make use of the 300HP and command feature.  This truck comes alive at high speeds and the ride feel solid, but luxurious.  Poor on gas, but what do you expect from a 3 ton truck.  I suggest replace the air filter with a K & N for better fuel mileage and performance.  I really enjoy the LR3's blend of the utilitarian look with the luxury amenities.  If you're in the market for a purposeful luxury truck, the LR3 is the quentatiential vehicle for you.  It doesn't scream poseur, ostentatious, or whats the point like many competitors.   "

The headrests are so poorly positioned that I am spending a fortune on neck pain!!! Land Rover North America is not doing anything for me!! Tires, had to be replaced at 13,000 miles. LR3 broke down for no reason and they still don't know why. It is not a safe or comfortable vehicle. Buy a toyota, at least they hold some value!"
land-rover,lr3,2006,bgsntth, 07/02/2009,Fabulous Beast,4,"I just turned in our SE V8. It was a truly wonderful truck, and we fully utilized every aspect of its function and performance. We have had many luxury SUV's that performed the dual duty of soccer mom mobile and ranch truck. The LR3 exceeded beyond everything in both aspects, and was more reliable than all the others barring the Lexus GX. Cargo area is huge, rear seats are roomy and comfortable for adults, off-road capability with Terrain-response is w/o peer -barring my wife's '08 RR. Only wish it had the Dynamic Response and a diesel option."
land-rover,lr3,2006,bgsntth, 02/12/2008,Purpose built,4,"Have 10K on our LR3, and in that time it has seen duty on/off-road, snow, soccer mom stuff, and as a surf vehicle. The third-row seat is amazing for its room and comfort. The rear cargo area is like an enclosed pick-up. The ride is smooth and rarely bottoms- out, though the handling is somewhat ponderous and could benefit from the Dynamic Response System in the RRS. Off- road it is, of course, amazing. I took 6 people on an off-road tour, which included a 30 degree slope ascent over loose dirt. We use the air suspension daily for loading, extra suspension travel over speed bumps, and warding off door dings in combination with the side-steps. It is ungainly in appearance, but ungodly practical."

Rides a lot better than the lexus, handles well, tows my boat over anything where the lexus always felt strained. Advanced drive systems do work well in the truck off road. Alot of room and a great load carrier. If you need a real SUV and not just a road machine then this Landrover is the one to go for. It can be thirsty and so far i have only had one fault which was fixed by the dealer while i waited."

Mainly on road driving, but some off-road on iced dirt roads with inclines and sideways washouts. The Rover virtually drives itself with the auto programs and didn't hiccup.  In some snow/ice storms I was forced to drive through-I always felt safe and secure in the vehicle. Near sports-car handling in such a big vehicle-contrary to some writing it is not tippy to me at all under any conditions I've encountered."

While they are two very differnt car they both provide a great driving experience.  I have really enjoyed my LR3 for the 2 weeks that I have had it.  I look forward to taking it into the Cascades and testing it out a bit more.  I do think that where it is great for style and offroad it is lacking in luxury assets.  My Infiniti ($10K) less was much nicer inside and had a lot of standard features that the LR3 does not have.  Come on Land Rover, step it up in the standards.  Finally, GAS, are you kidding 12-13 mpg if I am lucky."

As nice and dependable the Fords were, My new fully  loaded 2006 Landrover LR3 HSE is a dream come true. So far it is an amazing piece of technology.  Unique things like the multi user entertainment system which  allows up to7 different users to each listen to or watch their own thing.  The refrigerated console is literally cool.  The voice activated navigation, phone system and audio system all work like a charm, once you get through the high learning curve.  It is an extremely solid, well handling vehicle, very well appointed. The 3rd row seats work perfect for adults."

Wanted to go back to sport utility for a change.  I learned a painful lesson at the fuel pump with this vehicle.  The LR3 rides great and is dependable.  Just don't get one unless you absolutely neeed a SUV.  The fuel mileage is so bad you will fill up $50 to $60 every 3 to 4 days.  Otherwise great vehicle.
land-rover,lr3,2006,Marloag, 08/23/2005,LR3: Driving can actually be fun,4,"My experience with the most recent LR3 I purchased has been great.  It is actually fun to drive.  It has wonderful off-road capabilities, as well as being very comfortable and roomy inside.  The three sun roofs make the whole car bright and even more spacious.  The navigation system is relatively easy to use, and very helpful.  The folding-down back seats has been very useful as well."

This is my first LandRover vehicle and I really enjoyed the purchase process and the dealership.  Being a previous Lexus customer I am very impressed with the LandRover philosophy in treating their customers.  My local Lexus dealership has lost its ""halo"" and I think their success is harming their ability to treat customers as well as they used to.  Thank goodness there are choices in the marketplace and I am so far very pleased with my new vehicle and the dealership.  They know you as a name not a number."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Fast Eddie, 07/28/2006,Good Ride,4,"I own a new LR3 and enjoy the ride qualities of this SUV, very smooth and quiet. On the freeway it seems a bit sluggish but once up to speed it really holds it's own and again the ride is very smooth. I have had some issues with the check engine light coming on and off, make sure you screw the gas cap on snuggly the MILS system is very sensitive and this will cause the engine light to come on.  One thing to be leery of is the vehicle only takes super unleaded (91 octane) that is a huge chuck out of your wallet with the price of fuel, the dealer will not tell you this. Overall I do enjoy driving and owning the LR3."

Thank god I only got a 2 year lease. I had to put all new tires at 16,000 miles. Every time it rains my wife gets soaked with water pouring in from the overhead lamps. It's been in the shop about 6 times in the last 18 months for various flaws. One day we were on a family trip in the winter and the LR3 simply shut down in the middle of the road."

The dealer, as nice as can be, has not yet been able to correct cruise control and ABS problems on the troubled LR3.  I'm on my third trip to the dealer.  Fortunately, they give you an LR3 free as a loaner.  That said, they are wonderful cars..maybe the best overall vehicles I've ever owned.  I live in the mountains near Telluride, Colorado.  Our home is off a rural dirt highway.  I often use the suspension height lever to clear deep snow.  You will love this vehicle..you will probably love your dealer (at least ours), but be prepared for some trying moments."

The windshield sensors don't work right and so you have to manually operate them which can be hazardous on long drives. (There is no intermittent control) I've had the car for three months and it has been in the shop for at least 3 weeks. Lots of trouble with the compressor and rattles we can't get rid of. There are a lot of blind spots. Should be more luxurious for the price. Hard to find climate control buttons. Doesn't have a lot of pick up for a V 8. Car has a nice exterior appearance.

Many of the problems have been minor (broken seat belt, gas cap fell apart, bright lights come on with blinker, etc.)but there are a couple of larger issues we are still trying to solve regarding suspension and the radio(which sounds incredible when it is working).

True to its Land Rover heritage it coddles you in comfort and protects you from the elements while taking you through all types of road conditions and terrain with ease.

land-rover,lr3,2006,dragos, 04/10/2006,standing out,4,nice suv overall... not your common look... could use some extra hp and some more mpg... a diesel version for usa would be desired for repeat customers... premium fuel is $3/gal... but... at 57K should not be a concern?!!!
land-rover,lr3,2006,bkalhor, 04/21/2006,LR3,4,This is my third LR and by far the best one to date!
land-rover,lr3,2006,Michael B, 05/18/2006,LR3,5,"I bought my LR3 through the Internet the process was painless.  I got the car at a great price.  Since I bought the vehicle I have not been let down.  I just got beck from the beach where I used the sand feature and it was incredible.  I was actually able to drive the car right through the surf. The car is comfortable with more than enough room and the features seem endless. From my reasearch of SUVs out there, the capabilities of the vehicle exceed most any on the market and the gas mileage is not that bad either.  We owned a Discovery prior to the LR3 and the two vehicles are like night and day as far as the comfort and features. They really have done a great job on this car!"
land-rover,lr3,2006,tstid, 11/22/2005,great veh...,4,"jsut purchased this month...great veh...owned ml, lexus...they don't compare...can't compare...the lr3 is in a league all by itself....roomy interior, great feel at the wheel...takes curves wtih a breeze...does well in crosswind and is very quite...true off road...looking for a true suv...it is the lr3"
land-rover,lr3,2006,bkalhor, 11/22/2005,2005 LR3,4,This is my third Land Rover and so far my best Land Rover!  I highly recommend it...however the gas mileage does put a nice dent in my wallet - it is still better than the mileage on my Series II!
land-rover,lr3,2006,Fatbob, 11/23/2005,Its a real Land Rover,4,This vehicle remains true to the Land Rover tradition of being capable off road.  In addition the new model has increased the on road drivablilty by a large margin over the old model.
land-rover,lr3,2006,Susan, 12/21/2005,Love It,4,"This car is great. If you want a unique car that is fun to drive and has functionality, this is it. I searched for a  7 passenger vehicle for my family and was two seconds away from buying an Acura MDX when we stumbled on the Land Rover. I am so happy and love everything about it."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Steve Baldwin, 01/15/2006,Land Rover Discovery III,4,My LR3 (Discovery III) is a wonderful vehicle which continues in the best Land Rover tradition of luxury and off-road leadership. This is my thrid Land Rover and certainly won't be my last. I am very happy with the design improvements and the fact that Ford has allowed Land Rover to remain Land Rover (Thank You Bill!)
land-rover,lr3,2006,CMHaverford, 01/31/2006,Awesome truck,4,"I've had Land Rover Discovery's for over 10 years and have always loved them.  The LR3 takes the experience one step closer to a Range Rover.  It drives very smoothly, more like a car than a truck, it's fast, and very comfortable.  Love the feel and look of the truck!"
land-rover,lr3,2006,MB, 01/31/2006,"4th Discovery in the family, big change",4,"This is our 4th Disco since 95, and this is a big upgrade, they have finally introduced the upgrades required to make this a better car to drive. Being a BMW fanatic, you can see the influence, unfortunately the ownership didn't last too long. Let's hope Ford doesn't ""screw it up""....  Love this vehicle, not as much as my Defender 90, but that's ok....."
land-rover,lr3,2006,retfalvi, 02/19/2006,LR V8 SE,5,"As expected the ""Queen of SUV""s. Love the solid feel and the quietness of the V8. Straightforward design, cannot go wrong with a Jaguar engine. Features are tailored to my needs. This will be a keeper."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Asif, 02/21/2006,Gas Guzzler,3,"Just bought the new LR3 SE. Love the drive and the feel of the vehicle. Probably one of the best handling and safest SUV's I've ever driven.  In the last 10 days I filled up the 23 gallon tank 3 times with the recommended premium gas. Each fill up ran about $55. The vehicle got about 250 miles to the tank full or about 11 MPG in city/highway driving. It is suppose to get 14 city/18 highway. Remember it is 4 wheel drive 24/7 and has a V8 300hp, and it is one of the heaviest SUV's out there (over 7,000 lbs.)  I would recommend that any potential owner rent this vehicle for one day and track the mileage based on the way you drive. If you're satisfied with the results, then buy this vehicle. "
land-rover,lr3,2006,D-man, 04/29/2006,Almost perfect...,4,"Had the Disco Ser II before this, wow what an improvement! They really got it right. The tight turning radius alone is worth the price, especially in tiny Los Angeles parking lots. Everything that was wrong with the Discovery was made right with the LR3. Fast, comfortable, fewer blind spots, fold- flat seats, impressive handling, spacious cup holders, really great stuff. The one-touch ride-height adjustment is great for those lower- clearance parking garages, and the stereo can deliver the goods when you're ready to rock out. Too many nice touches to mention in this review. We leased the car and will probably buy it when the lease is up. Just an outstanding SUV if you can afford the gas..."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Sierra Madre, 05/15/2006,Great and Awesome Car,4,"If you are looking at cars like crossovers or mid sized suv's save yourself some time.  This car is the bomb.  Sure, it's a gas hog and believe me we tested Camry hybrids and such but with the 2 year lease at LR it's a great way to hold 2 more years while the manufacturers get their stuff together on hybrids.  It's an awesome looking vehicle.  My wife is driving this one and it replaced an '03 4 Runner.  Get it!"
land-rover,lr3,2006,SF Dude, 11/27/2006,LR3 owner review,4,"This is a great SE V6 LR3.  My wife and I got rid of two cars and are sharing this truck.  She wanted to be high up, I like camping, we both wanted safety. This is our pleasure cruiser and grocery getter.  What a wonderful truck.  We are so happy every time we step out in it. Yes, it's a pig at the pump but I have been offroading twice in it and it's better than I could have imagined.  I love the Jag v6 engine, the Volvo safety items and am glad Ford owns it.  This car comes with a 4 yr 50k warranty and free scheduled maint.  This beat out the Cayenne, Touareg, A3 Wagon, Jeep Unlimited, Subaru WRX wagon & more."
land-rover,lr3,2006,GuyC, 01/08/2007,A Car with a Feel Good Factor,4,"On a whim went for a test drive & I have to say the ride surprised me.  I came away wanting to buy the car but needed to do some web research. I found so many negative reviews, the fuel economy & bad reliability that I rang the dealer & declined the deal we had discussed.  A couple of days later I felt the pain of non buyers remorse I dug deeper & found the fuel economy is really no different to any other SUV of this size and capability.  I went back, got the car, The fuel economy on commute is ~16mpg. When I drive, it feels like I should take a picnic to a polo game. This is without a doubt a car that makes you feel good and well worth the time to investigate properly."
land-rover,lr3,2006,David, 02/06/2007,Awesome SUV!!!,4,"This is a really fun truck to drive. We also own a Landcruiser and was actually looking to buy a smaller SUV like ML350 or X5, when we stumbled on this....Wonderful truck..This is now the truck of choice in my house. "
land-rover,lr3,2006,Ken Daniel, 03/16/2007,Great Vehicle,4,"What a surprise my wife and I received after driving the LR3.  WE drove all the other models including the new Acura MDX, the new Volvo and the new BMW X5. They were all good, but not great.  The LR3 drove as good or better than all of them.  It was very comfortable on the highway, tight and responsive, all the bells and whistles and more, including the GPS, fold down second and third seats, unique Europeon styling and one of a kind looks.  Give it a try before you make that final decision.  After 3 months, not one problem, as good as the day we drove it off the lot."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Rover, 03/31/2007,It is a LR afterall...,4,"The car is absolutely awesome. It is like having McGyver with you at all times. If you want perefection, I would look elsewhere (generic, blend with all, and is that my car?). Think of it as a thoroughbred, the care and feeding are most crucial."
land-rover,lr3,2006,Chris, 07/09/2007,"You only live once, buy yourself an LR3!",4,"I love this car/truck. It has all of the creature comforts one could want, but the designers haven't forgotten what a Land Rover is supposed to be about. It is great for towing, slogging through a blizzard, and 4- wheeling in the national forest.  It handles great, has a great sound- system, and ummm ummm, those heated seats in the front and back are great in Wisconsin winters."
land-rover,lr3,2006,upper midwest , 06/07/2007,King of the Road,4,"Was a Volvo wagon owner and follower but always admired Landrover. Was concerned about reliability, but after a bad dealership customer service experience at Volvo, I traded my vehicle in for a demo 2006 LR3. The ride is phenomenal. I'm 6'1, 205 lbs and there's nothing like Landrover headroom, they are second to none. The seats are firm and supportive, and the instrumentation clear. An extremely technologically advanced vehicle as far as stereo, electronic gizmos i.e. rain sensor wipers, backup alarm, air suspension, ride dial and things I'm still discovering! The lure was all servicing is complimentary during warranty. Can't wait for the Minnesota snows!  "
land-rover,lr3,2007,RM, 12/06/2006,Great all around Vehicle,4,"So far it has been great. I especially enjoy the feeling of security when driving around in the LR3. In addition greatly enjoy the Logic 7 sound system, the simple to use NAV/GPS, the integration of Bluetooth and Voice Command. Voice Command takes a little getting used to and can be a little frustrating at first.  When driving I enjoy using command shift. The brakes are amazing for a vehicle of this size and weight. The steering is precise and the ride is very smooth thanks to the air suspension.  The flexibility in seating/cargo configuration is amazing. The kids love just about everything about it.  Can't hardly wait to take it on a long trip. The more I drive it the more I like it"
land-rover,lr3,2007,Vance, 08/21/2009,No Worries!,4,"We needed a family utilitarian replacement SUV after all the negative safety issues with our Pathfinder.  We stumbled across an 07 HSSE with less than 17K on it while looking at an 09. This was our first experience with Land Rover.  We tried the Pilot and the Highlander, but then they are everywhere and very dull.  This was love at first drive!  Quite different than some of the negative comments read before hand.  It was smooth on the road and very comfortable, while having tons of room in 3 rows.  Better yet its not a ""manly man"" truck like a Tahoe or similar.  And the plastics are fine.  Much better than what we were expecting.  Yes, gadgets are plenty, but read the manual.  It works!"
land-rover,lr3,2007,pouladi1, 04/08/2011,Why drive Bland when you can drive EXCITING!!?,5,"I just purchased a pre-owned, mint condition 2007 LR 3 V6 , This is my 3rd Land Rover and to be frank the only thing I hate is why I waited so long to buy this SUV!?!
I was
lucky to find my deep green exterior, beige leather interior beauty!
The drive is smooth commanding and fun!
Fit and finish is perfect, The vehicle looks so gorgeous and the interior looks expensive. Dont look elsewhere, just drive a Land Rover and see what all this fuss is about, I guarantee you , once you drive one, you will not drive another vehicle!
coincidentally the day I bought it snowed and all i did was to activate the terrain response!
it drive through ice and snow like knife through butter!"
land-rover,lr3,2007,Brian , 07/21/2009,Love this vehicle,4,"I truly agree that this is not the best vehicle on the market for getting kids to and from school and day in day out errands, but when you baalnce that out with weeknd trips to the beach, hiking, mountain biking, and towing a boat there is no better vehicle.  I got rid of my first LR3 and bought a smaller fule effecient SUV and after 2 months went back to and LR3.  I can't see myself in any other vehicle.  During fishing and camping trips I have found myself in a few off road/water situations and have never had an issue even when the passengers doubted it could get to the place we wanted to go.  It polishes up well for days in the office, but also loves to get dirty and looks good doing it."
land-rover,lr3,2007,MC, 12/29/2006,LOVIN IT,4,We bought a Range Rover initially and loved it so much we bought the LR3.  And it does not disappoint.  What a great SUV.  Absolutely no complaints.  The Range Rover may have a sleeker style but otherwise the LR3 is very comparable.
land-rover,lr3,2007,ML, 06/04/2008,A soccer mom's dream!,4,"This is my favorite SUV! Waited to write review in case I had reliability issues that I had read on this site - 9 months/20K KM and nothing so far. Compared to my past Escalade, Denali, Touareg, Jeep GC ltd, and MB 430, my Rover is way more fun, sturdy yet nimble, tows with ease, has more versatile interior space, much quieter cabin, better road view & headlighting, most headroom, and all the luxuries to boot. Not quite as quick as Touareg (V10 mind you!), 5.4L Jeep, or MB430, but shift into sport and it provides more than enough power for the average Joe. Breaking is strong and confident for a vehicle this size. Purchased the LR3 over the Lexus 470 & Audi Q7 - glad I made the right decision!"
land-rover,lr3,2007,Pameal, 02/21/2007,"Great Car, Terrible reliability",3," I love to drive the car, but I have not had the chance to enjoy it. In the 6 months that I have owned this car, It has been in the shop for 2 1/2 months of it. The service department has been very nice but no one can fix the vehicle. "
land-rover,lr3,2007,grampulla, 06/03/2007,Love the LR3,4,Great car if you're buying it for the right reasons and not  for a soccer mom/dad car. Might want to look elsewhere for that but if you're looking for an SUV that will support and active outdoors lifestyle or haul around 7 adults with no problem then this is your vehicle. I owned a 2000 Disco which I loved to hate but still decieded to take a chance on the LR3 and so far I am happy I did. Being a LR I did buy the extended warranty to 7yr/100000 and we'll see how it goes.  Rear seats fold down completely flat and allow me to put up to 4-5 bikes in the back of the vehicle. I mounted fork mounts in the rear seats and now my bikes stay put.  
land-rover,lr3,2007,VincentET, 10/17/2007,So Far So Very Good,4,"People and magazines have said LR's aren't reliable, but so far not a single problem. I like this SUV better than any of my past vehicles- Jeep Grand Cherokee, MB ML320, Cadillac SRX, Infiniti QX4. All those trucks had numerous service issues(except Infiniti)."
land-rover,lr3,2007,Bradley, 12/06/2007,Outstanding Vehicle,4,"Each day of driving I am more pleased with the LR3. I have accrued 4000 miles so far and have enjoyed every one of them. The vehicle is a bit heavy, but has a very smooth & comfortable ride. The 4.4 liter V8 performs well in all normal day to day driving conditions. Some dedicated studying is required to make full use of the stereo & climate interfaces. Though overall, this vehicle gives its driver an incredible sense of poise & stability....rain or shine, but especially rain!"
land-rover,lr3,2007,Stephen, 11/28/2006,It Wows!,4,"This is one smart, hot, sleek, functional, stylish and rugged baby.  That is a disparate set of qualities and as a loyal Land rover driver, I didn't ever expect to have all these attributes in my vehicle.  Past Land Rover Discoveries inspired a grudging loyalty among devoted fans.  The LR3, well thats altogether different...  Unreserved and undiluted satisfaction.  I just love it."
land-rover,lr3,2007,uncle ollie, 11/29/2006,The best there is,4,"The experience has been fantastic. this is the best built vehicles in the world. i live in Maryland and since I've had my vehicle, I pray for snow."
land-rover,lr3,2007,Charles from Canada, 04/27/2007,Has not met expectations,3,"Replace our Honda Pilot with this and not sure it was the best move. At times the LR3 is great and a cool car with great features and technology, but the reliability and service has been poor. Also the handling is not good and the fuel mileage is a disaster. We generally enjoy it with the family, but glad we leased because this vehicle unfortunately has caused too many problems. Our Cadillac SRX blows this vehicle away in every regard and every day the short stick gets to drive the LR3."
land-rover,lr3,2007,gillz, 01/29/2007,Worthwile to wait,4,"Waited for the 2007 model so that could get the benefit of a couple years worth of production issues getting resolved.  LR also added the lumbar, seat movement without key in ignition and other improvements for 2007.  Only 1000 miles on the vehicle, but already in snow and on hwy, both cases proved to be a flawless performance."
land-rover,lr3,2007,cbm, 04/30/2007,Outstanding thus far,4,"The vehicle has been a pleasure. Great looking externally and internally, excellent layout and ergonomics, and incredible flexibility from an amazingly comfortable road trip / commute car. Prepared to take the beating of bad roads / potholes / merges....but clearly is just so roomy for moving and hauling people and gear while being right-sized for the city.  "
land-rover,lr3,2007,RM, 04/20/2007,12000 miles of Driving Pleasure,4,We recently went on a family vacation to the US (round trip was about 2200 miles) On the return trip we drove non stop for 17 hours with only four stops for fuel and creature comfort. I continue to be amazed by the LR3's smooth ride and comfort and felt relaxed after 17 hours. The features that were really handy during this trip were the very capable NAV. Voice command and bluetooth were very helpful and allowed me to concentrate on driving. Command shift minimized use of brakes on the highway. The flexibility of the HK sound system was a hit with the kids.
land-rover,lr3,2007,Gillz, 05/03/2007,First 5000 miles,4,"Have gone offroad (snow/rock) as well as 1500mi mountain / freeway drive so put the new LR3 through the paces. Result is a very comfortable, pleased customer. No problems to speak of, just a rattle behind 2 speakers which the dealer fixed."
land-rover,lr3,2007,SF Owner, 05/24/2007,"So far, I'm in love with this truck!",4,"The design couldn't be better, and they realyl thought of all of the little details in this thing. I bought it with 45K miles on it, so I'm hoping that anything that would have gone wrong by now has already done so. The company offers extended warranties as well. Great for road trips- very roomy."
land-rover,lr3,2007,Canuck, 10/03/2007,Great Ride Great Value,4,"Despite some initial hesitation, I am glad I went for the LR3 HSE. Overall it is a great vehicle in any driving situations. The comfort and ride is superb even during long trips with kids and luggage. The flexibility of seating arrangements is second to none. The sense of security and off- road capability of the LR 3 place it in a class of its own. My wife and I went to the Land Rover off-road driving school in Montebello Quebec and loved it. LR3 is virtually unstoppable. It is not a SAV,  Crossover/sedan on steriods it is a true SUV. If you are looking for sedan like performance..buy a sedan. V8 offers plenty of power under all normal driving conditions including passing and goign up hill."
land-rover,lr3,2007,Chicago's Car, 10/12/2007,Best Luxury SUV For The Money,4,"Everyone expects a lot of vehicle at this price point, $40k - $50K.  I had researched and shopped the Toyota Highlander, Buick Enclave, Mazda CX-9 and the Honda Pilot.  For the bottom dollar cost - the LR3 had the most standard amenities and safety features by a long shot at this price point.  At the upper levels of any of the models I looked at, they all came within a stone's throw of my purchase price. This SUV is extremely secure in all driving conditions. Driving in downtown Chicago, this car handles stop and go traffic with ease. Very strong braking and sufficient acceleration with the V8. Highway driving is whisper quiet - and there's no other SUV that has a better driving position."
land-rover,lr3,2007,steve, 07/10/2007,Landrover LR3 HSE,4,i have been enjoying this vehicle ever since i got it. It did well on our trip considering how many ride in it and handles well. If you are looking for a  mid size SUV and still want cargo this is the car to get. The 3rd row seat is good to have in case you find yourself carrying more than expected. Of cousre it handles great off road. 
land-rover,lr3,2007,lr3lvr, 09/24/2007,Recommended!,4,We are completely happy with our LR3. It's a real head turner and not to be confused with any other. I've owned other Land Rovers and this is the best by far! 
land-rover,lr3,2007,carz, 03/13/2008,Land rover quality,4,I love my vehicle. It runs smooth and no problems what so ever. I don't like the fact I get 15 miles per gallon. One stumbling block I have had is I bought a boat recently and now need a hitch. The dealer quoted me almost $800 for a hitch. If you don't need a hitch and don't care about gas mileage this is the greatest SUV.
land-rover,lr3,2007,Peter Conant, 08/29/2019,Still love the lr3,4,"I purchased a 2008 LR3 with 150,000 miles. I looked at about  four  LR3 and a couple Lr 4. Decided to go with LR3 because I New I would have some service issues that would be costly and hated to spend a fortune up front and turn around and spend another . 
I looked at car fax and car gurus for about a year. I could not buy a car without looking at it in person. I went on road trip to an area full of LR3 and looked at as many as I could. 
The one I wanted was in a run down lot , lthe only car in the lot that looked like it could start . It was the lone, shiny black LR3. Drooping down on it’s front leaking shocks.  In still had to have it. 
It was a Saturday, late morning, nobody around , just the proverbial dog barking from inside the locked,  trailer home office. 
Left a few messages. About two hours later, driving away from lot to look at next towns bounty, got a call to set a meeting later that evening. 
Nice guy, the LR3 looked pretty good in comparison to most I looked at.
Had a few issues that the seller said he’d take care of.
Decided to fly back when he was done sorting it out and drive home in my new LR3.
Four weeks later, “it’s all sorted out”
I fly in and get picked up from airport 
By seller. He’s driving a Ford Escape .
We get back to the trailer home office, 
The cars is getting a new brake caliper installed, it would be a few minutes. 
Let’s go downtown to the “ my mechanic”
The Swede . This is when I got to see the underside of my LR3 in all its glory. 
I still had to have this LR3. 
I got them to come down a little in price and I closed the deal.It made the four hour drive home with only a little rumbles. But all in all I was optimistc with my purchase. 
It is awesome. Cleaned her up real good, played with the ride hieght,  up and down,  up and down. Then took dad for a ride. 
We got home and passenger door would not open. No matter what I did, couldn’t get it to unlock.,
My 85 year old father,  walker bound, was trapped  in my LR3. I am amazed how such a large person could manuver around so much fragile plastic barbs and nothing broke. He will not ride in my Lr3 to this day. 
Two weeks later, after taking to service shop, declining the $850 estimate to merely open the door, which I stripped of it’s interior door  card and passenger seat for full access, the door just decided to unlock on its own. 
Ok. 
Instead of merely opening the door, this boutique car service establishment did take the time to let me know everything possibly wrong with my beautiful LR3 at the hourly rate of $189/ hour. So my $7000 car would now possibly be worth close to $12000. 
Ok.
I am amazed how much service information there is on YouTube for LR3’s. I guess this is due to demand of so many DIY’ers . I lived through keeping a e39 BMW running, now I get to cut my teeth on Land Rover. Even though it’s merely sitting in my car port for the time being, I can start her up. Watch the fire works of strange lights and gyrating tachometer needles doing what they may. 
It’s a Land Rover and I still love it.

land-rover,lr3,2007,skinnyheart, 07/20/2009,Do not buy this car!,3,"I love so many things about this car - but I hate many more. I have lost count of how many times I've taken this car to the dealership to repair malfunctioning lights, seat heaters, etc. (I think it's been 8 so far). The front window molding blew off on the highway 3 months after purchase. In the last two months this car has broken down twice - while we were on vacation both times - and it only has 25,000 miles on it. It is at the shop now, 400 miles from my home. Who knows what is wrong with it. It is very poorly made."
land-rover,lr3,2007,Prawdz, 05/21/2007,Enjoyable,4,"We really enjoy our Land Rover. We are first time owners and feel the realibility and service is teriffic. Because of the large engine and performance, the gas mileage is disappointing. As well all the offroad gadgets can get in the way. Really, do any of us actually use half of what the Land Rover offers in off- road performance."
land-rover,lr3,2007,ZCS, 08/02/2007,Love it,3,"Had a 04 Lincoln Navigator before. Time for something a little smaller. Owned a 1999 Discovery II for 4 years before the Lincoln. The Landrover is just built better. Better quality material. People complain about quality. Never had any problems with my Disco and nothing so far with the LR3. Funny thing my Acura RL was in the shop more than either of these two trucks. This truck is great. Outstanding looks and the dealers rock. Best Ive ever had. Better than my Mercedes, Acura, Lincoln, BMW."
land-rover,lr3,2007,bob, 05/19/2007,Great vehicle,5,This is the greatest car I have ever owned and I have had it for a few months with no issues. It has great space whenever I need it. It is great to have third row seat that fold into the floor because I dont need it that often.
land-rover,lr3,2007,e, 08/24/2007,"Completely disappointed, cheaply made",2,"We sold our 2 year old GMC Denali to get the LR3, and have regretted it every since the first week. We have had nothing but problems, one thing after another and live 3 hours from the dealership. The Land Rover is built like a car 1/4 of the cost. To pay 50+K for our land rover, you should expect more things standard like a navigation system or at least something that tells you which direction you are headed. It seems the LR3 is poorly made and we will not be upgrading to the Range Rover sport as initially intended. I would NEVER recommend one. I am a mother of three and drive very conservative, still after less than 20K miles we are having to replace the brakes and tires. WHY? Cheaply made."
land-rover,lr3,2007,kimabob, 06/23/2008,I do not recomend this car,3,My last 3 cars have been Land Rovers. I like them because they are so big and roomy. I dont ge't claustrophobic in them. So as usual I got a land rover when it was time for a new car. I don't recomend this car one of the worst things with high gas prices is the 15 mpg and premium gas. The first few weeks the engine was smooth and fast but now it is pretty loud and a little bumpy. All the features are a little hard to remember how to use. Folding the second row seats flat is a little bit of a struggle and there is not as much leg room as expected in the back seat. The third row is pretty comfortable but with the third row up there is only a couple inches to put bags. And only 1 of the three sunroofs open
land-rover,lr3,2007,robbymcc, 02/20/2007,So far so good!!!,4,"I changed from a Discovery II, Tell you all about it later, to the new LR3. I chose V6 because I really don't think I needed the V8. Excellent equipment, beautiful soft ride. Handles just as I thought it would."
land-rover,lr3,2007,Happy LR3 Owner, 05/17/2020,Wish we had two,5,"Bought our LR3 and we love it. Very versatile seating, makes it easy to have multiple seating combinations, no other vehicle we know of has this capability. The body is well built with solid body panels not a tin can. The frame and suspension components are a superior construction. Very capable off road and just as comfortable on the road. One minute you can drive through trails in the elements the next pull hit pavement like a refined performance vehicle. Great visibliity. Ive had an engine light for a MAF sensor only because in Vermont you can go from 60 degrees to 35 if you drive up over a mountain the changes of climate so quickly trips the MAF. Maintenance has been average no different then any average car. Just never want to bring to a dealer. The interior has plastic but less then Toyota and the fit and finish is clean and tight, on the up side easy to clean. I had a Benz GL 450 which was like a land rocket all the way up to the day it threw a tire rod and the cpu tried to drive for me to prevent a collision and bounced off two Jersey barriers. Air ride had bugs worked out and is leaps and bounds better then Benz. The air bags are covered with aircraft alum. Unlike Benz where the bags are exposed to elements. The rover is not as fast but lets face it with laws that enforce how fast you go the rover is just right. I personally get 21 mpg average with the rover. That's driving following speed limits and not hitting the highway like I'm about to take off. This is a great truck. We have one and I would like one in every color if I could.

land-rover,lr3,2008,fallout79, 05/24/2014,Best SUV,5,"I had always considered a Land Rover but been scared of the reliabilty. I finally went for a test drive and realized just how good this vehicle is. In terms of design, comfort, style, and capability there simply is not another vehicle that comes close. I bought an 08 with 70k on it and got an awesome deal. It had a full service history and was in mint condition.
I drive it all day for business in the week and get around 18mpg. At the weekend I can load it up for weekend trips to the mountains and go on offroad trails that are extremely challenging.
Othertimes I tow our 25' boat with ease.
I'm at 90k with no problems. I have it regularly serviced by the LR dealer who are great. Best SUV!

Edmunds asked for an update so here it is: Now at 124k miles with no problems.  Great car.  Still looks awesome even though it's 8 years old.  Hauls, tows, goes offroad anywhere you want to go.  Found another place to service it closer than the LR dealer.  Haven't had any issues - everything works great as it should.  I have no complaints about this vehicle.  It has been awesome.

Another update:  145k on the clock - no issues at all.  Still love this car.  Want a new one because they are shiny but can't justify it with this still looking and running great.  It is a great ride on the highway, and does anything you ever want to do offroad.  Also tows our camper and boat anywhere, anytime.  I strongly recommend this vehicle.  I keep waiting for something to go wrong, but nothing has.  Even the seats still look brand new which is pretty amazing with 145k!

land-rover,lr3,2008,maddog72, 06/27/2012,Not your average SUV,4,"This is my second LR3 have over 150,000 miles of driving in both. Present 2008 has 63,000 miles. I have extensive driving experiance in all types of vehicles from H1 Hummers to Toyota Prius. 
Land Rover LR3 is not for everyone, if trips to the mall or shopping is all you do get a mini van.
My LR3 is used 60/40 60 % on road 40% off road. It is the only vehicle that you can drive down the interstate at 70 mph and then go off-road and back on the interstate and do so with the easiest driver input.
This is a truck, it is big, heavy to get good gas mileage you have to drive it like you want good gas mileage. I average 18 mpg with highs of 21 mpg on trips in flat country. 
Off road this is a tool"
land-rover,lr3,2008,Rocky Mountain Roving, 07/16/2015,Sexiest Road Beast with a Soul,5,"This is not just a soccer parent/mall tripping machine.  It's not for lead foots who increase speed heading into a turn.  This is an adventure hungry, behemoth of a truck, with the DNA to clean up seamlessly for a refined night on the town.  

The LR3 is heavy...heavier than the average family adventure car on the road.  It's 2.5 tons of highly engineered assemblies fitting and working together, with sensors to monitor every lean, pull, push, and bump, all fitting into a sturdy, tank-like structure.  There are about 3 miles of wire linking sensors to computer.  And if the factory has a computer update, it's best to plug in at the shop and get the system updgraded.  An upgrade might reboot sensors to communicate more accurately for better driving experience.

This is not the kind of car for the kind of owner who takes maintenance lightly.  If you've ever let your car tell YOU when it needs its maintenance service, then this may not be a good match.  Once you've gone that far, there may (or may not) be other related issues effected.  Driving it is fun, responsible ownership is keeps the apprehension for reliability down.

Because she's an overly engineered wonder, diagnostics, repair, and maintenance are an involved commitment; read...$$$.  But these can be a minor issue if you look at the big picture:  You're an ordinary Joe who can reach EXTRAordinary locations with a stock Rover.  And stock means leather seats, great sound system, amazing all-terain-response capabilities for height adjustment, clearance, big windows for easy viewing, and an option for 3rd row that capably seats adults.  You can have an all-adult, off-roading excursion.  The cabin is quiet enough for civilized conversations.  And the views and experience are only as limited as your fear of the unknown.  And she can cross a body of water to a depth of the top of the doors with a snorkel...holy bagumba!!!  

Did you know you can mod a tent to the top of your Rover?

I can head down the highway on a road trip at a comfortable 70 mph, turn onto a rough road for a harrowing climb over a pass, and then ease myself down back to pavement without ever having to worry about ability.  (Note:  always try to travel the rougher passes with friends; they can hop out and spot you through your next move if the road is full of questionable obstacles or too narrow).

If you need to clean up for a special event, you're in luck:  the Rover exudes an elegance that no other 4x4 has.  Easily transform her into your personal, high-end private car for a night on the town, or even executive-toting, car-pooling daily driver. No trip is too big or too small.  The key is to play up the variety.  

Being able to drive a new Rover off the lot has built-in peace of mind with the extensive warranties.  Buying a used on will require a great deal of leg work to make sure the truck you want has been lovingly cared for.  

Don't let the city/hwy mileage scare you.  Always know that it's a combination of factors:  type of tire, breaking and speeding habits, city vs. hwy driving, etc.

I have 2008 discovery3/lr3 with the  luxury, cold weather, and heavy duty package with front parking sensors And rear entertainment center.  Best car I have ever owned!!! And I have owned alot, 15+ since I was 18. This one is staying around for a while. There is nothing it can't do.. well everything except gas mileage. It is quite thirsty guzzling down premium petrol.

land-rover,lr3,2008,Barry, 04/05/2009,Favorite vehicle to date!,4,"This is the first vehicle I've owned that I actually like the more I drive it.  I use it for every-day driving, hunting in EXTREME off-road conditions and even towing my 22' ski boat every now and then.  I own many vehicles including off-road 4x4 trucks and I've found the capabilities of the LR3 are MUCH better than the pickups for hunting - and way more comfortable!  Driving horizontally on steep hillsides is unbelievably comfortable due to the air-suspension self- levelling system.  This is my first Land Rover product but I think I'm going to ditch the '08 Lexus and replace it with the '09 Range Rover for the ""family"" vehicle.  "
land-rover,lr3,2008,Peterkin, 10/10/2008,Saved My life,4,I was driving my brand new Land Rover Discovery last week when the car next to was hit by another car and hit me. I was pushed off the road and hit a group of large trees at about 40 MPH. I did not even have time to hit the brakes. The car did everything right- all airbags deployed engine shut off etc. I walked away -the car totalled. You know all the other features are great but safety is number one. I am picking up my new Discovery soon!
land-rover,lr3,2008,kdflyer, 06/17/2009,Fun to drive plus much more,4,"Great vehicle, went from a fully loaded Toyota 4runner to LR3 and after way to many years in a Toyota found something more fun, limited owner group and great dealer support.  I recommend changing tires to standard SUV tires and watch fuel economy go up by 1 - 2 miles per gallons and better ride and longer life.  Put 2 extra pounds of pressure in tire and she really sails down the interstate.  3rd row is awesome design compared to everything else in this class.  Looking forward to the LR4.  Trade off from the Toyota is better space, better visibility and after changing tires better fuel economy.  Drawbacks is number of dealers but quality has been great."

Live where the snow flies 5-6 months of the year, Lr3 is a beast in the snow. Love to embarrass my two buds with hummers, not even in the same class. This SUV is not to drive to the mall or g-store. Love to drive this car, went on trip to florida with two kids.....great. The gas mileage was expected averaged 21mpg on highway. The car makes me walk funny, built like a tank."

Handling is precise with insulated road feedback and excelleent pot-hole dampening. The LR3 is underrated and is a great value for the money. This is our second vehicle and enjoy the comfort it provides in all driving conditions. Our last LR3 was involved in a highway accident and the truck provided adequate safety and protection for the family while absorbing some tremendous forces.     "
land-rover,lr3,2008,Wolfey, 04/02/2008,Great SUV,5,Bought my LR3 HSE a little over a month ago. Traded in an H2.  I absolutely love this truck!  It surpasses the Hummer in every way. I'm getting over 18 MPG. The build quality is excellant.  The ride is great and the handling better. Slap the selector into sport mode and this puppy hauls like a sports car. And I love that 550 watt stereo.
land-rover,lr3,2008,Vincent, 12/07/2008,Design Flaw,4,"Love it!  Contrary to some reviews, I like the lumbering feeling in the LR3. Very roomy, very safe. My wife drives my 2 kids around and about, and I am at ease knowing they are in such a solid and safe vehicle. Here is the flaw. After a severe fall rain storm, my wife opened the door of our LR3 and water poured out of the front passenger seat. The dealer told me that leaves clog the soffet for the moon roof drainage system. The H20 has no where to go, so it falls inside the car.  She said it is a design flaw for all 3 models. She knew exactly what it was when I called it in. If you garage your LR3, then don't sweat it.  If you have a garage that is too low for the LR3. Heads up!"
land-rover,lr3,2008,socalrover1, 09/24/2008,Amazing Vehicle that keeps giving!,4,"The LR3 is the most versatile vehicle I've ever owned.  We have two kids & a dog & we've had our LR3 for 6 months.  Interior space is very ample.  This truck drives like a car in the city.  It's easy to park.  Snow or mountains, the LR3 has blown me away at it's capabilities.  It can do far more than I'll ever have the guts to push it to do.  The LR3 is built like a tank.  I feel so comfortable with my wife and kids driving around in it.  I get about 17 MPG city & 20 on long trips.  Painful with prices where they are now, but not bad considering the size and weight of these vehicles.  We looked at Mercedes, Volvo, Lexus, Acura, and BMW.  No regrets!  The family loves the LR3 more each day!"

Piano-black wood...so nice but hard to really see it...so black. Ride is smoother, rock solid, no clunks, flatter in curves, less body roll (likely all due to 'newer'). Much less wind noise, virtually eliminated!!! 550W H-K sounds much better but likely due to less wind and road noise.  1st gear lurch is gone, likely transmission programming improvement. Plenty of power...doesn't need any more...it's no race car.  Love this truck. Suggest leasing...resale value stinks...surprise "

land-rover,lr3,2008,Nate, 06/25/2019,It's a European SUV,4,"Up front: European vehicles have different strengths/weaknesses.  This is my second LR3, my first being an '06 SE. As The motor and interior are fabulous. The high-revving jag 4.4 is eager to please and the air suspension modes find good positions in both regular and sport modes. Seating height, visibility, and cabin space are delightful. Plastic-y materials on the doors and console make for a cheaper feel but the ergonomics and design easily make up for it. Exterior design has aged well. The LR3 is an easily pleasing vehicle to drive and own, when it doesn't have common issues arising on a regular basis. Mechanically, there are some items to be aware of: chassis and drivetrain components seem to wear quickly as well as a couple of common electrical quirks (Tire pressure sensors finnicky, CD changer issues, rear hatch latch). Any forum search will show the common issues. In both my LR3's I've had to replace some common items that are pretty spendy. Between tires and mechanical repairs I spend about $2500/year in repairs (I get about 3 years out of tires). Granted I've purchased both of them at about 50k miles and all these parts seem to need replacement over the next 50k.  I have 115k on my '08  but I still love it.

For the money I don't think you can beat the performance or styling, with it's updated exterior it's a real head turner. Very pleased with the updated interior as well, the seats are higher quality and much more comfortable. It handles great and has plenty of power.

land-rover,lr4,2010,Terry, 09/12/2015,Almost Perfect,4,"First and foremost this SUV is beautiful and a pleasure to drive. Now for the bad! Air suspension is problematic! My air compressor took a dump at 50K right out of warranty. $1400 to repair. looks like LR knew about the compressor issue and upgraded the 2011+ models. nav/radio blanks out from time to time...easy fix. shut down and restart. last but not least, deep pockets for the service dept. Don't get me wrong, service(Land Rover Huntington) are very professional and are amazing. But....$200 for an oil change, that's out of control. Another issue i also had was the front control arm bushings going bad causing another $1000 deposit to the service dept. Now the good! Again AMAZING to drive. V8 has endless power, active air suspension(when it works) gives a smooth confident feeling. Its very handsome,its not the most expensive LR but it still gets the head turns like its bigger more expensive brothers. It truly is an amazing vehicle, just make sure you buy CPO or make sure you have it warrantied with a LR approved extended warranty company.

land-rover,lr4,2010,RoverAnon, 05/15/2019,A great SUV for the family,5,"We've driven this SUV for 2 1/2 years having put about 40k miles on it after buying it used with about 60k miles.  In that time  the only thing we have done is regular oil changes, a set of tires  and doing the front brakes (which I did myself).  We've had no trouble with it at all.  We homeschool with 3 kids and the rear is very spacious for loading all their stuff once a week for the co-op they go to. The extra seats in the back are also handy when the kids want to sit someplace  different or you have an extra passenger. The split hatch is very convenient for loading/unloading.  On the road it has great visibility and a very comfortable ride.  The V8 has plenty of power for accelerating to merge into traffic.  My wife loves driving it since it is a very attractive vehicle.  Gas mileage on the highway isn't great - about 20 mpg if you don't drive too fast.   It's also gives you the impression that it's a very safe, solidly built vehicle.  Our previous vehicle, a BMW X5, became a maintenance nightmare as it passed 100k miles.   So far the LR4 has had no issues as it passes the same mileage.  We've been extremely happy with this SUV

Speeding ticket within 3 hours of ownership! Outside facelift is a huge improvement, much classier looking, head/taillights, grille. Inside, overall much nicer and higher quality except a few pieces, better leather, inside of doors is a huge improvement. Miss the old headrests with the handles on them, adjustable headrests should be better, but love the old handles.  Off road is amazing, love climbing boulders in this thing.  No significant problems in any of the 3 LRs. Gas mileage is a little worse than previous LR3s. Sound system is improved somewhat, nav also...both are fine."

    I fell in love with it as soon as I seen it online and definitely after I drove it the next day.
   I've always loved the looks of land rover .
   Not so much the new discovery and others that look like the typical America SUV like Ford & chevy.
   But this LR4 is amazing almost went to look at two  LR3's until I seen this awesome looking machine. 
    I love everything about it.it was taken care of for one thing.has a couple little dings and scuffs but I have a paint and body man that is unbelievable at repairing these little blemishes. 
  Or he can redo your whole vehicle just had him paint my front and back bumpers on my 2011 mits galant.
  Matched colors like it was from factory. 
   But the only thing I hate about my new land rover is the damn stigma that comes from all the issues rover has had in the past and still has today.
 2015 model discovery has many recalls and issues.
   Why in hell cant land rover get it right.do they not care about the clients.theres alot of money wrapped up in one of these vehicles.
   Everyone I see says boh your going to regret buying that.there money pits.
   And what do they drive.junk Ford trucks and cars.
 And yes I know theres Ford influence in the land rovers unfortunately. 
   I will never ever buy a ford.my son in law and son have had issues constantly with the trucks. All I can say is I love my LR4 and  if I have issues with it I will de deal with them.
   I feel I may just be past all the issues  at close to 110,000 miles .the previous owners have had to repair replace and fix whatever has gone bad.
   It's as solid as any vehicle I've ever driven steering is tight no play in it at all.
   Suspension is smooth and works great the motor runs smooth and very powerful. And the interior is so plush and comfortable. It's just a great pleasure to own and drive. 
   Maybe my mind will change down the road but I truly dont see that happening.

The LR4 was more refined and less 'bread truck' looking than the LR3 so I decided to take it for a spin and what a spin it was!  I was hooked on the first curve.  The LR4 is spacious with an improved engine giving it plenty of torque to both hug and pull the road towards you.  The grill is downright sexy.  I love all the windows and height inside the cabin.  There are sensors for both the front and back of the vehicle.  There are so many places to store things like my sweater for when I go into a restaurant or my gym shoes for walks in the woods or the golf range. There are two ample glove compartments up front.

The look is clean and the drive is far superior to the LR3 series (quieter/tighter). Seats are reasonably comfortable. Some controls for navagation/cameras/dvd are a bit cumbersome but learnable. At about 3800 miles the first service visit was for a check engine light that we were told was a ""computer reset"" issue.  Two days later the light was on again and before we could get a scheduled appointment another ""impaired performance"" warning light was flashing. 3 WEEKS later the dealership calls to say the backordered injector has been installed. My wife gets in and the service engine light was on before she left the lot. Doesn't bode well for reliability!"

Owned an 08 LR3 which was bullet proof, pretty much brought it in for scheduled services and changed the tires.

Current LR4 is at 21K, and the only 2 trips to dealer were for the first service
and for an insp. sticker. 

Vehicle is refined and holds up well. 

17.9 mpg. on avg.

I have two friends that have Range and they are looking into picking up a LR4."
land-rover,lr4,2010,tjp74, 01/26/2010,A giant step for Land Rover,4,"This is no typical midlife facelift. I could see that Land Rover engineers and designers really poured their hearts into this new design. I could tell their efforts. I've got the top of the line, HSE Lux plus package that has standard 5 camera surrounding monitoring system. It's got black premium leather with no cost optional Grand Black Lacquer wood trim that makes the whole interior look so gorgeous. The difference between LR3 interior is like night and day. I also looked at new Lexus GX460 and to me, there is no comparison. Ride and handling is very good. My previous car was Lexus GS350 AWD sport sedan. LR4 doesn't feel like big heavy SUV. And huge room for the 2nd and 3rd row passengers."
land-rover,lr4,2010,MaineRover, 02/10/2010,Amazing Land Rover,4,"After having test driven the LR3, I was ready to be underwhelmed by the LR4.  A test drive sold me, after a few weeks of ownership - love it. The LR4 is much better riding and handling than the LR3, hopefully reliability will be improved also.  On road, it is gutsy, responsive and not too tippy (no more than my old 4Runner or FJ).  Off road it is sick.  Snow and ice are all I have had a chance to play in yet, and this thing is sticky and sure footed.  Recommend the upgrade to HSE package, esp for colder climates.  Have not had passengers in the 3rd row seats yet, so will see if they live up to the billing.  Finally, the tax benefits of the LR4 are significant. Makes it easier on the wallet"
land-rover,lr4,2010,LoveMyLR4, 09/27/2009,Fun and comfortable! I love it!,4,"I got it yesterday and can't get out of the car! Always wanted a LR3 but was stuck on a lease and then decided to wait a few month for the arrival of the LR4. Looked at the GL-450 and the Q7 and was tempted by their diesel option, but the LR4 offered the best value, the best ride and a very quiet cabin. It's very spacious inside but not big and bulky. I got the Lux Package. It's fun to drive and very comfortable. "
land-rover,lr4,2010,vimal1970, 11/14/2009,New LR4 LUX LOVE THIS SUV!,4,"I drove up from Virginia Beach to Richmond VA on 11/7/09 and bought a LR4 LUX. We just had a bad Nor'easter here in Virginia Beach, I can say that the LR4 made us more comfortable driving through the heavy rains and floods. LR4 was for my kids and wife's safety...over the low mpg. The kids and wife were able to see everything and clearly. The ride is amazing...I am glad I bought this over the Q7, GL- 450/320, LX470. A very well thought out car with seating for 7 adults. If you are planning to buy Land Rover in mid-atlantic...Go to Richmond Land Rover.I am already looking into a possible 2011 Range Rover for the wife so I can get her LR4 for myself next year."
land-rover,lr4,2010,mikee, 02/11/2010,Great Truck,4,"I have now had my LR4 for 2 and half months now. I LOVE the Truck. It drives great. Much better than the previous model.It's smooth, it's very comfortable and everything is laid out very well for the driver. It has great cargo room and seats 7. Visibility is great for driving and great for parking. Fuel is not the best, but this is a go anywhere vehicle. Beach driving is a breeze, snow is no big deal. If your looking for a 7 passenger and go anywhere vehicle and drive in luxury.This is the vehicle for you. I am very pleased."
land-rover,lr4,2010,Dream Girl, 03/08/2010,It is a Dream,4,I had 2 Pilots for a total of 7 years and just didn't like the way that they drove in the wet/snowy weather.  I test drove every 3rd row crossover/SUV in existence. Someone mentioned the new LR4 and once I drove it I could never look back.  It is an absolute dream to drive and to own.  I finally feel so safe and secure driving during this brutal winter.  I highly recommend this vehicle.  I have done years of research.
land-rover,lr4,2010,lr4fan, 03/02/2010,"LR4 after 13,000 miles",5,"The LR4 is one of the most practical and useful automobiles available for persons interested in off road capabilities, adult seating for up to 7 and civilized handling and ride manners.  The ride is firm but does not cause road fatigue on bumpy or uneven pavement.  The interior is spacious and the seating is plush but not overdone.  Heated seats and steering wheel have come in handy this winter (global warming aside).  Rear view camera and front/rear parking sensors are handy in parking lots.  This suv is easy to drive and has a small turning radius.  The nav and ipod electronics have worked well.  There have been no problems or warranty work.  Gas mileage: 16-17 in town and 20 on highway."
land-rover,lr4,2010,KCRover, 03/29/2010,The perfect Luxury SUV,4,I had a Denali for 7 years and decided on the LR4 HSE.  The more I drive it the more I love it.  The interior quality is unmatched and the ride is impeccable.  I love this ride.

It goes through snow like a knife through butter.Very comfortable , stereo is great , fun to drive and I feel very safe in it. I think it is the best value from Lexes to Mercedes. The power of the car is awsome."
land-rover,lr4,2010,Stephen, 05/29/2010,Best SUV in class,4,"I just bought my LR4 a few days ago.  I upgraded from an Audi A4.  The LR4 is so much fun to drive, and you will definitely catch people looking at it. I test drove the Mercedes GL but decided to go with the LR4.  I haven't had any regrets.  Of course, it is too soon to talk about reliability but so far I love my LR4.  It feels so strong and safe on the road."
land-rover,lr4,2010,FirstLR4, 06/24/2010,It's a head turner,4,"I am proud to say I have an LR4. The car is chock full of options and amenities that make it feel like it should be much more expensive. I test drove the Mercedes ML350 at about the same sticker price and it lacked several of the options and features of the LR4. Very happy with my decision and would highly recommend to anyone. Reliability was the only question in my mind, but the thing feels solid when you drive it. While I probably will never take my LR4 off-roading, its nice to know that no matter the situation, I'll likely be able to get out. Get to your nearest dealership and test drive one."
land-rover,lr4,2010,Alex, 07/18/2010,The good gets better,5,"I just exchange my 2008 LR3 to the new LR4. It's a great improvement, never had any problem with the LR3 but, this one it's quicker and interior is very handsome. I know, the gas is kind of low but what do you want for a big truck. The ride is supple and secure, and that is the important thing for me.  "
land-rover,lr4,2010,Skippy, 07/24/2010,Love it so far,4,"When my wife and I went shopping we looked at all the competitors. Decided to look at the Range Rover Sport but liked the LR4 more because it was so roomy.  (I am 6'2"" tall.)  Test drove and loved it.  After 3 months I still do. Great performance.  Poor gas mileage?  Sure but that is the trade off I was willing to make for the ride and power. The visibility is really great.  Inside it almost feels like a greenhouse with all the glass.  I am pleased with the sunroof shade.  I was wondering about that since it is not a complete blackout.  It has turned out to be perfect. I will use this vehicle occasionally off road but honestly doubt that I will ever take it anywhere close to its limits"
land-rover,lr4,2010,NaplesLR4, 08/02/2010,Best LR Yet - Lot of Vehicle for the $'s,4,"After 2 months, loving this vehicle more and more every drive. When storms and rain kick up it somehow makes me feel even safer than when pavement was dry. Great on the highway. Haven't been off-road yet, but if it handles like previous LRs it is sure to be amazing. 375 horse has some kick but supercharger would be nice option. Can't stand the heater elements in the windshield. They are less noticeable with sunglasses. Priced out a new windshield without them for $675 - we don't have ice on the windshield in S Florida. Stadium seating in the back beats all the competition. In fact, you can't find a vehicle out there for 7 with all the quality LR4 has for the price period. Nothing compares."
land-rover,lr4,2010,O, 07/30/2010,A British tank with same fuel mileage,4,"Had it for about 6 months, driven about 5000 miles.  Drove it over two curvy mountain roads during a blizzard with no problem.  Had to take it in twice. First time was for a vibrating noise during acceleration coming from the dash.  Dealer said it was a loose wiper motor.  Second time was for a tire pressure monitoring system failure (which cleared itself b4 getting to dlr) and for a ""software update"" which land rover insisted was not a recall in their letter.  There seems to be some build quality issues. Hopefully they don't turn into long- term reliability issues. Vehicle is very stately looking.  You don't see one everywhere like my old Ford Explorer. Wife loves it. Happy wife, happy life."
land-rover,lr4,2010,Crewcabrob, 08/27/2010,Extremely quiet and smooth riding,4,"This has to be the quietest vehicle I have ever been in.  My wife has a new Lexus sedan, and this truck rides better and is quieter inside by a large margin.  We just finished two family vacations with our 3 teenagers.  You know this truck is quiet when both of my daughters comment out of the blue how quiet it is. Power is available all the time and passing long strings of cars is not a problem.  My interstate mileage has been awesome.  The best has been 19.4 mpg at 75 mph for almost 200 miles. There is more than enough space for our family and everyone gets to spread out.  Nobody feels slighted if they sit in the third row.  I love the fact that the suspension self leveles for any load."
land-rover,lr4,2010,SWFloridian, 09/25/2010,LR4 after 5000 miles,4,"Have the LR4 now for 3 months - driven in mountains, on poor road surfaces and highways. Its fun to drive, very quiet inside and comfortable. Like the air suspension very much - makes it easy to get in and out without extra steps. Wish it was offered with a Diesel engine, the V8 gas engine is thirsty (14.5 mpg) but has good pick-up. Off-road performance is second to none. The NAV unit is not top notch - missing many smaller streets away from Metro areas. Also one has to ""agree"" every time the NAV display is turned on - that's a pain. In summary: great multipurpose vehicle, comfortable and quiet, roomy inside and has all the creature comforts one needs."
land-rover,lr4,2010,acpryor, 10/22/2010,Buyer beware. I tried to like it.,3,"Great seats. Power when you need it. Awesome stereo, when it works. And therein lies the rub. Routinely the nav/stereo/phone would go out, no sound, no screen, etc. Been to the dealership 5x and they still didn't fix it (or replace 1 part). Sent letter to lr intl pursuant to lemon law. They arranged for 1 more opportunity to fix it. Didn't fix it. Acted up again requiring me to drive over for the 7th time (with company in town for dinner no less). In the process of trying to get my money back based on ky lemon law. Dealership has been great (not their fault) but lr intl who approves warranty repairs hasn't done jack. I'd never buy one. If asked, I'd tell my friends never to buy one"
land-rover,lr4,2010,Karl, 10/27/2010,Close to being perfect,4,"Have driven 6000 miles in 5 months on all terrains and can't say enough about the comfort, utility and off road capability. The air suspension allowing the vehicle to be lowered makes getting in and out easy. Pickup with the powerful 8 cyl engine is great and one feels really safe in the LR4.  Wish it had better fuel performance or the choice of a diesel engine. Otherwise nothing to complain about. Great car."

I have had such great luck with it - It is difficult for me to find anything new.  I hate the auto shut off almost all autos seem to have now.  I am hoping the new Defender will have all that I am looking for.  If not I hope LR brings the LR 4 back!

land-rover,lr4,2011,red_rover, 05/14/2011,2011 LR4 HSE,4,"After years of debate, I finally bought one of these things despite the warnings of high costs, poor mileage, and electrical problems.
Now I have an LR4 and am experiencing high costs, poor gas mileage, and electrical problems.

That said, I love this truck.
On-road it is elegant and well-behaved;
Off-road it is unstoppable.
However, the LR4 is not for everyone.
It should be a purchase based on emotion, as it is primarily an off-road truck that happens to drive quite well on the road.
If you think you'll like it - you'll love it.
If you're worried about cost or reliability, or if you never go off-road, then you may want to consider something else.
But then again, life is too short!"
land-rover,lr4,2011,CAH, 02/21/2019,7 years and counting,5,"I purchased this one-owner certified LR4 with 27k miles on it. I had looked at it and driven it multiple times but couldn't pull the trigger because I was afraid of its reliability. Finally, I took a trip to New Orleans and saw a bunch of LRs and took it as a sign. Now, seven years later I still have my LR4 and it has been the best and most reliable vehicle I have ever owned. I still find excuses to go and drive it. It is fast, smooth, uber comfortable and there's space for 7 adults or lots of cargo. The generous door entry space and ability to raise and lower have been key in transporting my father anywhere he wishes to go. The turning radius is amazing and in our sometimes brutal Midwest winters, I feel safe and secure. Maintenance is expensive (tires, brakes mostly) as is the premium gas but worth it to keep it in tip top shape so I can own it for another 6 years. I rarely see another one where I live but when I do, stop and stare - I think it's still a gorgeous ride.

It is absolutely the most comfortable auto I've ever driven.
Everything w/in the cockpit is at my fingertips.

Despite the scare tactics which seem to abound even on reputable review sites I have nothing but praise for my Land Rovers (Dicsovery2, LR3 and now a LR4) along with my Jaguars (an XJL and my current XJ VDP).
Where does EPA get these MPG figures?
My Hondas NEVER got the predicted MPGS always falling a few miles below the hopeful predictions, yet my LR4 (and LR3) get a full 2 MPG higher than those on the EPA sticker!
Reliability in the first weeks through 2,600 miles has been perfect, not a single flaw.
My previous new cars from other manufacturers never accomplished that."

land-rover,lr4,2012,Jeff, 11/11/2017,I leased it so much I bought it,5,"Review based on HSE model.  It's everything you think it is:  very, very comfortable ride (my wife often says she doesn't want to get out of it when we reach our destination), roomy, seats 7, tows a good-sized boat, easy to park in the city, great on long (350 mile) rides, quiet, good sound system, good looking, reliable.  The electronics, especially the nav system, is dated, and a little slow.  The fuel mileage is awful (15 MPG average), especially if you drive above 80 MPH.  (At 55, it's close to reasonable, at around 25 MPG).  I leased the car for 3 years, and residual was better than the lease, so I bought if for 3 more years.  The interior is a little drab by today's standards, but certainly still luxurious.   2 glove boxes, lots of storage.  You don't get much more car with the  Range Rover - but you do get less seating and storage (!). The air suspension is stupendous - just swallows bumps in roads.  With 75,000 miles, i'm on 3rd set of brakes (city driving), second set of tires (Continentals came stock, were very good, Pirelli's on it now are great), 250th tank of gas (!).  Contrary to what I'd heard, the car is very reliable:  I replaced the air suspension compressor (under warranty), and a seat heater was improperly installed when we bought it; no other major repairs.  If this car had been electric or a hybrid, I'd never, ever sell it!

Of the hundreds of off-road adventures, it got stuck only once on a steep grade of deep gravel stone, which was to loose and deep to get traction.  I've towed a 22-foot, ~6,000 pound boat thousands of miles without an issue (though mileage went down to 11 mpg on average). On normal highway travel, I've gotten as high as 22 mpg (flatland in the summer with no load or passengers).  Otherwise, I usually get 19 mpg on the highway and 15.5 mpg city.  Have $$$ ready as repairs after warranty are stupid costly.  The bushings on the lower front control arms had to be replaced at ~90K miles (replaced both lower control arms myself and had re-aligned for ~$350).  The water pump went out along with a plastic part under valve cover at ~135K miles ($1,100 at a non-dealer shop specializing in Land Rovers, dealership quoted $1,600).  The stitching on the front seats broke on a seam and was re-sewn at ~145K miles ($225).  The exterior finish looks impeccable.  The interior, aside from the stitching, also looks impeccable.  Changing the oil takes 15 minutes and brake jobs are also easy for DIYers.  My twin daughters will be driving this vehicle in 3 years from now as the LR4 super safe.  I was rear ended by a Toyota Camry...totaled that car and only $1,200 of replacement plastic on the LR4's rear bumper. There's a limited selection of tires for the 19"" rims.

Now i just replaced the front control arms, water pump just went out and timing tensioners will be replaced in hopes of extending timing chain lifespan another 100k miles. My LR4 has been super good to me. Luckily my husband does the work so i dont feel the pain of repair costs. I will drive this car til the engine or transmission goes and based on my research that could be another 150k miles or more. Rock solid.

land-rover,lr4,2014,Mark Kalogeras, 03/06/2015,Leaked oil in first month,2,"I bought a new Discovery in December 2014.  In January, it started leaking oil. We took it back to LandRover and they needed 3 weeks to fix the engine, a major component of the engine had to be replaced. 

I really do not want the car back--it was obvious that it had significant defects when it left the factory. I asked LandRover to replace the car but so far they have refused and have not offered any other compensation for the fact that they sold me a defective car and all the hassle, grief and inconvenience associated with the whole mess.

Obviously, if I had any idea this would happen, I would not have purchased a LandRover.

Buyer beware."
land-rover,lr4,2014,KG, 12/14/2017,Original Owner LR4,5,"This is my 5th Land Rover and by far the best.  I still have relatively low milage (under 30,000 miles) but the SUV is solid.  Great interior space.  Great visibility.  Smooth ride.  Classic and unique styling!  Land Rover has come a long way in design, comfort, and technology.  It is what it is (not meant to compete with BMW or Porsche in speed) but a fine vehicle for the performance purpose.

land-rover,lr4,2015,J. Miller, 08/06/2015,Great car if you like high pitch whistles,1,"I bought a 2015 LR4 in March, and thought I would share some information with prospective buyers.    Land Rover USA has admitted that their is a problem in the air conditioning system of the 2015 LR4s, a problem that causes a high pitched whistle to be emitted from the dashboard area whenever the air conditioner is on (as it often is if you live in texas).  Land Rover says this is a ""characteristic"" of the 2015 LR4s, and have offered no fix for the problem.  If you are considering purchasing an LR4, I would seriously reconsider, until Land Rover has a fix for this issue.  Though the dealership has tried, they have been unable to fix the problem, and my car has spent over 40 days in the shop since I purchased it.  Update: car was in shop 100 days in 2 years and I had to hire a lawyer in order to have car declared a lemon.  I will never drive a Land Rover again, and I highly recommend no on else drive one either.  LR was terrible to deal with, was not concerned about me as an owner.

land-rover,lr4,2015,Tom Henry, 03/07/2019,Everything I expected and then some,5,"I am always hesitant to write or, for that matter, give to much credence to reviews as they are based, primarily, on a single encounter with something.  Rarely, does any reviewer have the luxury of ""testing"" multiple models of anything to be able to give a fair review of the overall product.  So here is my, singular in scope, review of my 2015 Land Rover LR4 HSE.  First off, are you freaking kidding me!!!  It's a Land Rover and deserves all the cache' associated with the name.  My LR4 is built like a tank and sports similar gas mileage as it thirsts for nothing but premium grade fuel, and upkeep can be a bit pricey.  So what!  I knew that going in.  It's huge and boxy, but I never lose it in any parking lot, as it stands out among the herd in its distinctive look and imposing height.  The interior is plush, sophisticated, understated, roomy, and never fails to impress any who have the opportunity to enjoy its spaciousness, even in the third row seats.  Fold the rear two seat rows down and the cargo capacity is phenomenal.  I was able to put a 65"" flat screen TV, in the box, lying flat in the back and still had room.  From the driver's perspective, you ride high in the saddle with a panoramic view of the world outside.  I have never experienced this in any other vehicle and it is most welcome whether navigating the insanity known as Chicago congestion or the wild country where roads no longer exist.  Not sure what everyone else has experienced, but in my opinion the only conveyance more sure-footed off road, regardless of terrain, is a Mountain Goat.  Is the navigation system slow and cumbersome?  Yep!  But, I usually know where I'm heading and have plotted my trip before leaving and.....can read a map if necessary!  One feature I cannot speak highly enough of is the Meridian stereo system.  I was lucky enough to get the top of the line and is CRANKS!.  Everything from Mozart to The Ramones clean, undistorted and loud.  I am truly sorry for those who have had a less than favorable experience with their Land Rover, but after all it is a machine and nothing is perfect every time.  For me, I wanted a Land Rover since I was 10 years old and watched Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom seeing a Rhinoceros slam into the side of one and it drove away.  Took me 45 more years to get one, but it was more than worth the wait and is everything I expected and then some!!!

land-rover,lr4,2015,Lmahler, 09/02/2015,2nd Land Rover,5,"We are a household right now with one and another soon-to-be teen driver. I have had a LR3 since 2006. In my mind as a mom it was known as ""the mobile command center"". With 5 seats in the back I could rescue kids at school from the school bus to become ""the Cool Bus"". Fast forward to high school.

We were in the market for a used car in a house with two teen drivers. My husband looked up my 2006 LR3 in the Kelly Blue book to find out it was worth about $10-12,000. I thought ""why are we lookig for a decent used car for under $20K when there was fantastic one sitting right in our driveway?"" I had one incident right off the bat with my LR3 with the power steering going out on our first road trip. LR took care of it right away, including the towing. From then on out I had no problems with my car-I loved Land Rover. I came to the conclusion ""why doesn't mom get a new car and let the teens drive my old tank of a car? ""

After building the LR4 online at the medium range with all the features we wanted, I tried out the same package at the Lux model range, only to go up $2000. I really didn't want the Lux for some reason but LOVE it and now have had it for 3 months.  Reading the other reviews, I have a few concerns/complaints. The weird whistling noise that to me sounds like it is coming from the stereo system was very prevolent in the first few weeks seems to have disappeared (fingers crossed) because it's annoying. 

The navigation system is really clunky, this is hands down my biggest question of ""what were they thinking?"". If you are entering an address  you need to start from the bottom of the menu. The keyboard is set-up in alphabetical order which is so counterintuative, who types like that??-NO ONE, LAND ROVER. And who in the world at LR said ""yeah, this is great, let's go with it."". As you are typing in letters the keyboard/screen goes dark for a second or so before the next avilable group of letters is availble, which is so slow!! The last time I used it my daughter and I were instructed to get off at an exit, we were now facing a traffic circle. The Nav system was silent for awhile while we drove in circles, then it instructed us to turn right on a street number that was not even on that traffic circle, it was just silent. We were so frustrated that we pulled into a gas staion, turned off the car, restarted it and reentered our destination. In the mean time we pulled out our Iphones to to direct us and it sent us on a totally different and better direction than the LR nav system.

We were lucky enough to have been in Europe this summer and staying at a hotel that had gorgeous BMW loner cars. There is no comparing the BMW nav system (which was all in German) to Land Rover's. BMW's was fast and sleek compared to Land Rover-I hate saying that because I really love my Land Rovers!! If we didn't have teen drivers I would still be driving my LR3-I loved it. I LOVE my LR4, I find myself feeling like a newly licsensed 16 year old  driver looking for a reason to drive my new car. 
I am so lucky to drive a car like this and my dealership in Portland, Oregon, Rasmussen Land Rover have taken amazing care of me. They were an enormous part of why I bought a second Land Rover and why I will probably buy a third one day.

land-rover,lr4,2015,Lynn, 07/19/2018,Run Don’t Walk From This Brand,1,"Worst car I have ever owned. Most expensive to own with out of pocket expenses ( on a lease), worst dealer support.  I had the engine go at 19,000 miles. Left me stranded two hours from my house. Waited for ever for the right tow truck because the dial shifter won’t move if the car is dead. Took them a month to find out the engine was leaking oil onto the alternator.  Eco Start worked for the first 5,000 miles than stop working. They fixed it when they fixed the engine and the car would randomly shut off when you stopped for a traffic light for example.  They refused to pay for a rent a car until I went to corporate and because I was over 80 miles from my house they payed because it was trip abatement but told me they would of not payed otherwise.  Dealer never returned my calls. I had to stalk them to get any updates. They treated me like pond scum. The dealer also told me to drive it the 80 plus miles home with the engine leaking once they fixed the alternator and put in a new battery I refused because they would of never paid for any additional repairs if something else would of happened. Tire light was always on when there was no tire issues. The car had low miles and was never driven off road and had two sets of breaks, two sets of tires, new struts, the parking break system failed because the parking break is in the center counsel under the cup holders and got moisture in it some how. That was 5 k.  The dealer only paid for engine all the other items were considered normal wear. Thats after they have had the car for 3 days. I get the breaks and tires but struts on a car with 25,000 miles. Also, the car was sitting in my driveway and all the coolant spilled out of it. no warning, no light on. navigation, dont bother. worthless. usb ports are in the glove box, which if you are driving puts them on the opposite side of the car with no where to put  your phone. Sirius Radio would drop out and random points and so would my cell phone I just thought it was a Sirius and a cell phone issue but I actually own a honda now and it never does that in the same areas with the same cell and Sirius. No apple car play , but when you play the music from your cell phone it would not move forward to next song   Random interior plastic pieces would fall off. Valet key is like a barbie butter knife and try as you might you can’t ignore the horrible gas mileage. Ride was great. Everytime you turn on the car your heart drops because half the time there is a warning light. Even if it is door open you are still alarmed because you are so used to seeing warning lights on in this car. Also, you have to always think of wear to park it because of the height

The first had multiple mechanical issues and I was given a replacement. Now my most recent LR4 Lux was also in the shop after less than ONE WEEK! I have now seen suspension issues, transmission issues, fuel pump issues and engine issues all within two brand new 2015 trucks and in a period of three months.

land-rover,lr4,2016,Lars, 09/26/2016,Organic Luxury,5,"2016 LR is in its last model year (purchased landmark edition). Driven 5K miles so far. No issues. Looked at new Q7 and XC90, and Mercedes GLS. Didn't test drive X5. GLS was too expensive and felt like a boat. XC90 had a noisy engine and road noise and marginal 3rd row seat capacity. Q7 was nice but 3rd row was horrible and almost too much tech and we didn't care for styling. Visibility was good in XC90 and marginal in Q7. So why the LR4? Visibility and ride height are awesome, engine quite and transmission super smooth, acceleration surprisingly adequate, road noise and ride comfort superior. Though body roll exists, tires feel planted. 3rd row has great leg room and seat height comfort. 2nd row, though not adjustable, 3 adults can sit shoulder to shoulder and comfortable. Navigation input outdated, bit slow, but functions very well overall and I use it quite a bit. Enjoy having easy to use knobs and buttons. Meridian sound good but not superior. Auto high beams work very well. No climate control sync. What are the two most important safety factors based on IIHS website? Weight (5600 lbs) and SUV. This machine hauls the 4 kids, wife and gear in what I like to call ""organic luxury"".

land-rover,lr4,2016,Jay77098, 10/24/2017,The sweet spot between utility and aesthetics,5,"I currently own a fully-loaded 2016 Lr4 ""Black Pak,"" and could not be happier with the vehicle. I traded in my full size Supercharged v8 for it almost two years ago because that vehicle did not have enough cargo space. The roof slants downward, which limits what can and cannot be placed into the cargo hold, and the back seats do not fold completely flat, which means that anything that has to slide forward must be picked up and pulled to the front area of the vehicle. My Lr4 has fold-flat rear seats that open the cabin area up to a size large enough to accommodate two sleeping adults! The materials are tough and rugged and ready for heavy-duty use. I drive the LR4 for both around-town, as well as off-road, something you have to do at least once with the Lr4. As for issues, I have encountered a roof  leak that happens in heavy rains, where the waters drips onto the driver's side floorboards. The dealership is aware of the problem and has a fix for it, but don't even think about trying to do it yourself as it's a major bit of work. The electronics are also a bit sluggish, and the sound system is good, but not great.

land-rover,lr4,2016,LR4 Owner, 11/09/2020,The Last of the Real Disco’s,5,"I’ve owned a 2016 HSE LUX Heavy Duty package LR4 for over 2 years. Have had only one issue with it (upper control arm bushings) at 45k miles which was covered by CPO warranty. 

 The Good:
 
 The interior is great, fit and finish is very well done. 
 Stereo is really good for a stock system. 
The Ride (Air Suspension) best ride around for a large SUV/truck 
 Off Road Capability is some of the best around PERIOD!
 Interior, the use of space, rear tail gate (great for sitting on), second and third row seats that fold flat! Best usable interior in an SUV. Stadium seating for rear rows, rear seats large enough for adults let along children.  
 Rear Skylight, perfect for rear passengers and dog owners. 
 Rear Heated seats and rear climate control including the third row. 
 Fridge in center console (Heavy Duty Package only)
 Driver Ads, off road drivers settings 
 Camera’s 
 Ladder box frame
LR accessories for your life style, also the available aftermarket support of parts/accessories. 
 Performance, not slow (V6 Supercharged) for a large vehicle. 8 spd transmission with paddle shifters that allow you to select the gear you want. 
 Best driving position, great visibility from the drivers seat (greenhouse), very few if any blind spots. 
Tow’s really well. 


 The Bad

This is not a soccer mom’s SUV, however people like to use them. I’m sure because of some of the advantages I outlined above, but LR4’s are never going to be a Ford Explorer/4Runner. A vehicle that weighs this much is going to have parts that wear, need to be attended to and can cost to repair if you don’t have a warranty or do the work yourself it can be more then what some are used to. But that’s shouldn’t scare people, just understand what your buying (a real off road people and gear hauler). It’s a shame that most people only write about a car when something is wrong, never when they are happy enjoying ownership, it’s just how things go! 
 Gas Milage, not good I average 13-17mpg
 Nav Unit, not great, slow but it works. 
 
 The Ugly

 The fact that TaTa changed the Disco so much, instead of building on its strong points. Not a fan of the new one. Interior is updates are super nice but that where the compliments ends. 

 Conclusion: This is the best family car I’ve had, sure there are things I’m not stoked with, but the “good” far, FAR outweighs the bad! 
These are becoming hard to find clean with the right options/milage/etc. grab one if you can, look for one with a solid history/ownership.

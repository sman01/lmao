tesla,model-3,2017,Paul, 06/29/2018,Worth the Wait,5,"Stood in line 2+ years ago before a reveal of a car was released.  Not because I'm a super Tesla ""fan-boy"", but the timing was right for when I'd be ready for a new car.  I wanted the Model 3 to be an option and hopefully still qualify for the tax credit.  I've been driving the car for more than a month now ... and WOW!  The acceleration and performance are beyond anything that I have experienced before.  The build is great.  Reviews of early release Model 3's should some issues but looks like those were corrected.  The single touch screen took a little getting used to, but now find it to be very intuitive.  Overall, a great car.

Update after one year of ownership

Can I give the car six stars?  Absolutely love this car.  Everything about it.

tesla,model-3,2017,Namafe, 04/24/2018,So happy to own and drive the best car ever,5,"You gotta be able to embrace some change if you want to enjoy this car. Controls, buttons etc, or the lack thereoff, are vastly different from what you might be used to. But basically you can still drive the model 3 like any other car, except it’s whisper quiet and super fast. Runs like on rails, hugs the road like no other. It’s lighter, smaller, and perkier than the model S or X, but still feels rock solid. Has plenty of space for a family of four, and road trips are no problem with a range of 310 miles and the super charger network. Charging at home overnight is so much more convenient than getting gas. Car gets better every month with ‘over the air’ software updates, autopilot keeps evolving. Would not trade the model 3 for any other car in the world! :)

tesla,model-3,2017,Pierre Monette, 07/08/2018,"Fantastic value, still is after 2 years and 34K mi",5,"My Tesla 3 has the extended battery, premium packages, 19"" wheels.    10,000mi review.                                                                                                                                                        What a fun car to drive, very fast, glued to the ground, corners like crazy, This is a sporty car by design, so the ride is firm but very good. The computer screen requires some patience to learn where everything is.....but after a few days, I like it.     The navigation is superb, the sound is quite good, I downloaded the Tesla app on my iPhone, now the car locks/unlocks when getting in the car or leaving, you can set the temperature remotely, the garage door opens within 100', closes when leaving,  storage is adequate  for this size of a car. It charges automatically after midnight for the lowest electrical rate.  I commute 100 miles so I don't have to use superchargers which are slow and pricey.  There is a lot of noise coming through on bad roads, can't wait to try some other tires, also significant amount of wind noise. I don't buy the Tesla story that since you don't have an engine, your hear more noise, simply poor design....I am sure the upcoming electric cars for the big boys will be a lot smoother. Since all the initial Tesla 3 are identical except for the color and tire size, I found a company that sells many options to make it yours (RPMTESLA).
Well 27000 miles stills works like a charm, no problem to report. I did buy a soundproofing kit, seems to help. I have purchased a set of Vredestein Quatrac 5, they have fantastic reviews

tesla,model-3,2017,George Hawley, 06/08/2018,Model 3 - still a winner in every respect,5,"Tesla hit it out of the park with the Model 3 4-door sedan.  As beautiful as the car is on the outside, it is an absolute joy to drive.  Even my wife, a non-techie, loves driving the car.  Virtually all the adjustments to climate control, seats, mirrors, steering wheel and other options are via the very well organized centrally mounted touchscreen.  Though smaller than the Model S sedan with a smallish 75 kWh battery pack, the Model 3 has plenty of leg room for 6 footers.  Tesla says 0-60 in 5.1 seconds.  It is more like 4.6.  Tesla rates the range at 310 miles.  The EPA says 334.  It is a great car on a road trip because of the efficiency with which it uses electricity from the battery pack and the rapidity of charging since there is less energy to replace. You will have trouble buying and eating a hamburger in the time it needs to charge, especially since they modified the charging software to shorten the charging time.

Around town it is very agile in traffic and parks itself, if you like, parallel and perpendicular.  On the road the Traffic Aware cruise control and auto steering are easy to use and work pretty well, though the driver must be alert at all times. 

Now with over 10,000 miles under its belt, the car has gotten better via over the air software updates.  The navigation system has been improved.  The car now can navigate itself off an Interstate exit, if you so choose.  The climate control operation is more intuitive and the touchscreen interface has even more flexibility.  All at no added cost.

Tesla decided they had to increase the processing power of the main computer in the car and add redundancy for extra reliability.  They changed our our computer board during a one day visit to their local Service Center.  The car now recognizes stop lights and stop signs to help navigate on local roads in addition to interstates.  Actual self driving is a ways off but the driver assistance features come in handy, especially on cross country trips.

tesla,model-3,2017,Rob, 06/16/2018,The future has arrived!,5,"I've owned some awesome cars, but this one tops them all.  If you have any doubt about the future of the automotive industry, go figure out a way to drive one of these.  Once everyone has experienced it, gas cars will be a thing of the past.  Driving dynamics, comfort, elegant and simple design, this car has it all.  One comment on the Edmunds review... I agree with everything except the low rating for smartphone integration.  One out of five because the reviewer(s) don't like bluetooth?  Everything is going bluetooth, and it's far simpler than connecting a cable.

tesla,model-3,2017,Rebecca Lee Perlow, 06/10/2018,Crazy Cool Car!,5,"I bought my Model 3 sight unseen or driven. Amazing and thrilling pick up, super smooth. The window views open and refreshing.   Remote updates are so fun to explore. Sound system is wonderful.  Love the simple voice commands ""Call""  "" ""Navigate to"" . Other Tesla owners so helpful! Someone asked me to roll down my window and said 'Welcome to the Family!' I looked quizzical and they laughed gently, smiled and said the ""Tesla Family!"" :) Friends have told me about the Easter Eggs, much more to learn and that is part of the fun. The drive is amazing. Great handling and turns easily. Support is 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Gives a smooth, quiet ride, air circulates well. Fits 5 comfortably. Charger installation was easy. I charge it about every 3 weeks. Charges in a few hours for  280 miles charge. Drove it from Los Angeles to San Diego on one charge with 100 miles left of charge! 
Definitely recommend this car. Goodbye Petrol! I'll never buy another brand!
"
tesla,model-3,2017,Jack Cunningham, 06/28/2018,Great car and a blast to drive,5,"In 50 years of driving this is the best car I've owned. Crazy fast and handling is great.  A little learning curve to learn to use the center screen but having all the controls in the center opens up the view of the road for the driver. Everyone who rides in this car is amazed by the performance. Worth the wait, go get yourself one.

tesla,model-3,2017,Rick, 08/07/2018,Love my second Tesla. Model 3 is a “game changer”,5,"I’ve been hooked on Teslas since 2016 when I purchased a Model S. I waited 2 years for the Model 3 and it’s everything I hoped it would be. Great acceleration, handling, and such a solid ride. The minimalist interior is very attractive and the technology is way, way, way beyond any other car manufacturer. You probably won’t realize it until you own one that you’re no longer driving a car but a mobile computer. The future is here and Tesla owns it!
"
tesla,model-3,2017,Zachariah Johnson, 07/25/2018,Better than an E46 M3,5,"My previous car was an older model (E46) M3.  The RWD Tesla model 3 is better in every way except handling in turns during spirited driving. However, keep in mind I have the stock high efficiency 18"" wheels. I assume having stickier 19 or 20 inch wheels would improve handling.
"
tesla,model-3,2017,John Schreiber, 10/05/2018,Skeptics—drive a Tesla 3 and see the future,5,"Now 12 months and 10,000 miles on my dual motor long range model 3. Pros continue to be the joy of driving a responsive well built car, the incredible technology the acceleration, the front seat comfort. The list goes on. Several long trips have been a pleasure since there are Superchargers everywhere that charge at almost 500 miles per hour. Updates continue free which add to the experience.
The only con in my opinion is the paucity of service centers.

tesla,model-3,2017,Pierre M, 08/18/2018,"quite a sport car! love, love it! 40K miles stil",4,"quite an unbelievable value, for the price of a Prius you get a real car, that looks good, fantastic performance, no engine noise, glued to the ground, with all the bells and whistles. There is plenty of room, I have taken 5 people on a ride, it is fine, as for storage again there is plenty of room. The acceleration is surprising it's like your on  a roller coaster ride, WHOOSH, your gone! I commute 100 mi, plug it in, it charges after midnight for the lowest electrical rate, I don't know how long it takes, I don't care, the car is ready the next morning. No more pitstops for gas, oil change, fantastic.
Update, March 2019, I have over 12000 miles, no problem to report, still in love with it!
Update September 2019. I have over 20000 miles, still no problem, still love it.
My only disappointment is that it is noisy, ie road noise, wind noise, I have installed the soundproofing gasket kit for the doors and trunks and the panoramic glass. All this is helping, but it is not an Audi....will change the tires soon, hope that will improve it some more.
I replaced the original Conti at 27,300 miles, which is very good for OEM tires. I replaced them with a set of Verestein Quatrac 5. These are superior to the conti. Softer ride, less noise, seems like they roll better, very good handling

tesla,model-3,2017,Susham Modi, 10/04/2018,Amazing,5,"This car is the future, love not only the tech with self driving like features on the highway, self parking and summoning the car but driving it is also ridiculously fun and makes you not want to use the self driving features. I had a Porsche before this and this 4 door car is both faster and somehow more agile. It’s a beautiful piece of work product.

tesla,model-3,2017,Joe, 11/28/2018,Everyone should own a Tesla!,5,"This is the easiest car to use EVER.......just need so break in use to figure all the incredible benefits of the car. I does everything with your smart phone or key card, Music system is amazing! You never have to start, just get in, hardly every brake due to regenerative braking, when you park, one touch sets emergency brake, shuts off the car when you get out and locks it automatically, set security system, even opens, and closes your garage door automatically!  I get in my wife 2016 ICE car and I feel like I'm stepping back in time 30 years.  The long range tesla @ 310 miles range helps completely eliminate ""range anxiety"" which I am sure you would get with any EV cars that get less than 200 miles per charge.  The Carbon footprint of this car is non existent when you use so you and everyone that owns a EV are helping ""Our Mother Earth and Global Warming Issues""  Thank you Elon Musk for moving the needle to get other companies to seriously address EVs and this Carbon issue.  Another thank you to the State of Washington people for voting in a Carbon Tax to help cut our Very bad Carbon issue on this planet.

tesla,model-3,2017,thecadean, 08/12/2018,"Hate to rain on the parade, good first attempt",3,"First I am a big fan of EV and have owed one of the first Volts and as an auto enthusiast I have either driven or tracked most every late model sedan on the road.  The Tesla Model S was a home run, certainly for the driver. Only notable down side was spartan interior, especially for back seat guest.  As for the Model 3, this would be a very nice $40k auto.  But let's be realistic, this is a $56,000-70,000 car and at that realistic price you have some stiff competition.  Many offer a fob, Leather seating with heat and cooling, Apple and Android Auto and a few other oversight like a simple driver side button to adjust the side view mirrors.  The door handles are annoying.  Both the flush exterior handles designed for either 2 hand entry or only left handers and the interior tiny button release are needlessly troublesome.  My corvette has the button- but much easier to reach and execute.  The biggest deal breaker is the constant need to look away from the road and search the center screen.  As someone who drives over 30,000 miles a year i am always keeping an eye out for distracted texting drivers now i have to be away of M-3 drivers trying to change their music or xm radio station as they reach across the dash.  Sure you can attempt to use the voice command.  Good luck, I have tried and just not that patient after 2-3 failed attempts.  How hard would it be to have a few steering wheel tabs?  Maybe on the Model 4?

But wait... you have to take midrange options only (which is $11,000 More) and they never announce price of mid range car when we book Tesla model-3. So taking our money , keeping in booking line , they are skipping to other customer to book added option car. this new customer are getting $7500 credit and utilizing all firs 200,000th car federal credit. when we actually get our booked car of $35000 promised price , there will be no credit left .

"
tesla,model-3,2018,Kevin, 12/13/2018,Best. Car. Ever!,5,"No degree of hyperbole could come close to describing how awesome and revolutionary this car is. Let me just state that this is the second best purchase I have ever made, after my house. I'll try to reign in my enthusiasm to provide a concise review.
Background: Coming from a 2001-era jalopy of an SUV, even a shiny new bicycle would have been a welcome upgrade. As a fairly tech-y millennial, I'd had enough knowledge of Tesla as a company when I plunked down $1000 to reserve the Model 3 in April 2016 to feel comfortable in parting with that money for a couple of years while awaiting the car. The higher profit long-range model came first and I had resigned myself to getting the short-range model at reduced federal tax credit, when low and behold, an unexpected mid-range was unveiled in October 2018 and I handed more money over to Musk & Co.
Transitioning to an EV: If you already drive an electric car, disregard this part. But most people buying the Model 3 will be buying their first EV, as I did. The transition is smooth. I do recommend having a reliable source of electricity to plug into nightly. Otherwise, a quick primer on amps, volts, kilowatt hours, charging stations, charger types, and battery chemistry isn't necessary per se, but it's good to have a working knowledge of what's going on in the car. Range anxiety goes away after a few road trips, and it's always lower in a Tesla than any comparable EV due to the extensive Supercharger network. I routinely use my mid-range model with 260 miles range to taken 4-5 hour road trips. Anything requiring more than 2 Supercharger stops (~550 miles, in my case) is annoying, and I'll usually use my gas-powered SUV for those trips. In my neck of the woods, home charging is 1/4 the cost of gas per mile (Supercharging is about 1/2 the cost of gas), so savings add up quickly if you drive a lot. The non-volatility of electricity costs reduces financial stress. I'm guilty of a bit of schadenfreude when my coworker complains about the price of gas going up (he has a BMW requiring premium gas).
Driving/Handling: Amazing. While I may not have much cred in this area, my brother in law (who has owned and tinkered with a Corvette-engined RX-7, Honda S2000, Miata, and a Datsun 280Z) was blown away by the instant torque, precise steering, and great emergency braking. And this is the ""slow"" version of the car!
AutoPilot: This is the number one best reason to own a Tesla. One may scoff at spending $5K on what amounts to a software unlock, but it's money well spent. In its current iteration, AutoPilot is accurate and greatly reduces fatigue during stop-and-go traffic as well as long boring stretches of highway with minimal traffic. I usually take over driving during heavy, flowing traffic, but I really don't have to. My only qualm is that I'm too impatient and want full self-driving capability NOW, but it's nice to know that my car can upgrade to that when it becomes available. I'd also like to see them reduce the alerts to grab the steering wheel as I truly feel that the system is fully capable of safe self-driving on highways in its current iteration, and that the nanny is there more to cover Tesla's butt (legally speaking).        Why you should get this car: Get this car if you want a stylish sporty ergonomically beautiful small sedan, if you are thinking about buying a battery electric car (there is no worthwhile competition to the Model 3), if environmental street cred is your thing, if you spend lots of time on highways and/or want to dazzle your friends with AutoPilot, or if you want the safest car available today. Also less maintenance / lower cost of ownership than comparable gas-powered vehicles. Most importantly, if you want a vehicle that could accurately be described as inspiring, made by a forward-thinking company headed by an iconic visionary with huge aspirations, I would look at a
 purchase of a Model 3 as a vote of confidence for this future and a big middle finger to the legacy automakers that drag their feet on battery electric vehicles and make cars that have no soul.
Why you should not get this car: Even at $35K, it's not the cheapest car on the market. And although it is bigger than one expects inside, it still is a small 5 person sedan, so if roominess is of importance, consider a Model S or an SUV. If you don't have the ability to install a level 2 charger in your home or routinely use a cheap/free level 2 public charger, you may want to consider gas-powered cars instead. Also, if you routinely are on the road for long road trips (600+ miles), the inconvenience of longer charging times vs filling up gas may become irksome.
Things I don't like about the car: The doors are incredibly light and require a firm smack to close properly ...even my old Mazda 3 had more premium feeling doors. Rear visibility sucks due to the high boot. Large turning radius. Voice control for music works only when there is strong AT&T signal; even in metro Orlando, there are gaps.

tesla,model-3,2018,Scott T, 07/24/2018,Silver Bullet - 2018 TESLA Model 3,5,"It is just a great car that happens to be electric.  I have had it since July 2018, after waiting two years, and I am glad I waited and did not settle for a lesser car.  The car looks great and handles like a road car should.  TESLA has done a great job to create a beautiful car that is fun to drive, safe and turns heads as it passes by.  The simple clean interior is not cluttered with knobs, as all the hidden high tech is handled through a intuitive touch screen, or by voice command.  The sound system is very impresssive. The charging is simple and mostly done at home with the TESLA wall connector.  Going anywhere is easy with the Supercharger network being everywhere.  I know I am never going to buy a gas (ICE) car again.  Great job TESLA!

tesla,model-3,2018,NIck, 12/06/2018,"I have a supercar for under $70,000 ?",5,"Update 6/6/19. Other cars are stupid.   How Tesla is pushing cars forward on so many dimensions and no other manufacture is even trying is beyond me.  It’s not about being electric that is most significant, its the software.   That is the big deal.  If Tesla mad an ICE car it would be so far advanced from others offerings they could not catch up.  They cannot even try, that is how behind car manufactures are in software, they aren’t even trying :(

I have a performance model 3 2018 which was traded for a 2016 Lexus RX F Sport.   $70,000 out the door.  -10,000 in taxes so around $60,000 all in all.   Some things you might not know.  Best stereo I have ever had in a car, including upgraded stereo from Lexus when the enhancement mode is on high.   The sound stage is invisible and completely immersive.  Full 5 bar graphic equalizer.  I don't know why this is not mentioned more, it is phenomenal for standard equipment.    There is no standard key, you use your phone or a ""hotel door card"".  So replacement keys are $5.   There is almost no maintenance.   If you don't follow the schedule the warranty still holds, this is because the car really just requires a coolant change and brake fluid changes (brakes dont get used much due to regeneration).   This is a major shift when compared to Porsche which has frequent routine maintenance in the 1000s.   The tires are excellent on the performance, but you will need winters if you live up north.  The seats are comfortable, fit me like a glove, better in comfort than the Lexus and the RX has great seats.  Coming out of a Lexus which has the settings divided all over the place in multiple systems, the configuration is very easy to use.  The dealer model is very different.  I picked up my car in 30 minutes with maybe 5 papers to sign.   No upsell at all !!!  The App that runs the car lets you do all kinds of stuff and makes the Lexus app seem ten years old.  It is so fun to use.   Plus there are third party apps that let you integrate into workflows and siri.  I can turn my AC on with a voice command.   Lastly, the performance of this car is beyond words.   You have to experience it.   It is so planted and fast.  You have to get into high end German cars to get this type of feel yet in some ways its superior.   Some  feel more balanced in hard corning but don't have the acceleration which is other worldly.  There is a place to put your phone with a charger that makes your phone accessible.   Lastly, the autopilot is so cool.   This car will off load much of the effort of driving especially in start and stop, where it can do all the work.   At $5000 it better be good, and its good and gets better and better.  Cons:  Door handles, some sounds from the cabin when it's cold outside, learning curve since it departs from typical car metaphors, Tesla is struggling with growth so the cars change from month to month instead of every year, UI takes a while to master but does become second nature.   And the car is fun, it comes with asteroids built in, a santa mode that reskins the interface for christma, cool names like ""chill mode"" (instead of eco mode).  Tesla has a fun vibe.  Lexus has a old vibe, taking itself so seriously in all manners.  I love this car!

tesla,model-3,2018,Paul, 10/01/2018,Amazing Car- Sketchy Buying Process - Some Issues,5,"Finally! I drove down to the Denver Littleton Dealer that calls itself “Tesla”. In a frenzy I picked up my new white model 3 amidst the 3 or 4 people that were running this giant dealership and feverishly delivering over 100 Tesla's that day to customers. The pace was frenetic. Plainly said, it looked like a business in desperation; about to go under, or desperately trying to meet demand. Everything prior to this day was done via email, no faces, phone numbers or names to remember, only random updates on my online account without notifications. Now, all the cryptic months of this had boiled down to one superficial moment of smiles from millennials handing off the car to me. I accidentally paid an extra 6.00, a refund of which I will never see, and I was “awarded” a car that had a different serial number than the one I came there to buy. The young attendants laughed as I asked for a test drive prior to handing them the check. I said ""how do I know I won't be buying a bag of groceries for my 54K?"" Their there was a blank look that only comes from the chasm that exists between people of different generations.  After I paid for the car I was given a short ""introduction"" of the car's operation by a woman who had one eye on the other people waiting in line that needed her services, I  finally drove off in my Tesla 3 while my wife took pictures!  

So, what did I think of the car? I haven't had it in the snow yet, but other than the maladjusted turning signal and 4 stripped bolts on the rear license plate holder  (and there is only one license plate on a Model 3), It is the best car I ever owned (and I've owned the very best BMWs, Mercedes. Porches etc.).  It is as stunning as the embattled Elon Musk is stressed out. No wonder every person on the planet is trying to defeat him. He just made the best car in the world. He and his car will be envied for a long time. And did I mention the acceleration? It knocks you back in your seat twice, advancing steady as a rocket on rails with the panoramic visibility of looking out of a fishbowl, and not a rattle could be heard...

Although the process and delivery was frantic, impersonal and distrusting, the 3 dual motor is indeed a game changer. A guy that designs a masterpiece like this can get away with a sketchy process and should be able to snarl at the SEC, quote dark poetry or smoke a joint any time he wants to. I only hope service is there when I need it….

OK, its been 1 1/2 years and 25K miles and here are my complaints: Don't leave your 3 in a cold parking garage at the airport and come back a week later. The battery will drain to near zero, just like when you leave your phone out on a cold day. The radio sometimes locks up and comes and goes, but Tesla says they are working on a fix. The streaming and Bluetooth play is seamless. The Bluetooth unlock-car feature is slow, voice commands are sketchy and the tires cost over 2K to replace and wear out quickly. The a/c in the summer is weak unless you turn up the fan all the way on hot days.  The sound system is radical. The service is seamless. Appts. are made through the app and for most issues they will come to my house. The acceleration of this car is remarkable. I was only beat twice on the highway by 2 modified WRXs (just barely). Summers are hot unless you by dual sunscreens that fit into the 2 full length roof window depressions. Charging at home through my 220V connection has been more than sufficient. I plug it in every night. Charging via the 110 adapter is very slow, but is adequate overnight and keeps me from having to visit a charging station. The car sits pretty low and I've scraped up the front underside bumper by not being careful. All things considered I LOVE THIS CAR.

tesla,model-3,2018,Matt W.M., 06/13/2018,First month from a former sports car owner,5,"I really like this car now. My first test drive was the day I purchased on faith about a month back. On that day I expected more out of it. My last car was a 350hp german sports car. While this has plenty of torque off the line, I thought it would be quicker. Now that I have driven this a few weeks I do really like the power, balance, and handling overall. It has grown on me. The stereo is great, but I end up using my phone or TuneIn, I hope there will be more popular options integrated into the car (Pandora or Spotify).  The tech is amazing in the car, the sensors, remote access, HVAC, and interior design all are great value. The build quality is better now than a few months back, I have a few minor items that seam cheap or misaligned. I'd prefer stiffer suspension. Autopilot needs to improve, which it will, but part of that is my own comfort using in urban freeways. Does it have minor issues? Sure, but that has been true with every car I have purchased, German, Japanese, and American. I prefer this over any EV or hybrid I have driven. This is truly a fantastic and futuristic car.

tesla,model-3,2018,Mark, 12/17/2018,Wow!,5,"I am one of the very lucky ones as I went into the Tesla dealer for a test drive on a Friday thinking if all went well I would place an order and have to wait for a few months (which I was OK with) only to find out the dealer I went to distributes more Teslas than any other location in the country after the main factory so they had a number available almost immediately.   I was able to get the exact model with the options I wanted for delivery in just two days.    While taking the test drive (or your first time driving one) it's a bit intimidating with so many features and things the car does not to mention using the touch screen for almost everything.    However, I found that on the way home with the car (only other time driving one was test drive) by myself I quickly felt very comfortable with the majority of the features.   Obviously there are a number that need more time to read about and learn (such as the autopilot features), but the basic car operations you pick up quickly.    I had very high expectations going into my test drive based on all that I had seen and read about the AWD LR Model 3 and I was totally blown away by the experience driving it and greatly exceeded even my lofty expectations.    The car is a technological marvel and performs incredibly well.   The version I have is rated at 4.5 seconds for 0-60 and on the test drive the salesperson had me stop on and then slam my foot on the accelerator (can't call it the gas pedal anymore!) and forgot to tell me to put my head back so like in all of the videos you see online my head snapped back to the headrest and the car shot forward at an amazing rate.   I know it's not Insane or even the Performance Mode, but honestly I don't see when you would need to accelerate any faster than the AWD LR version does.   The handling especially with the regenerative braking (which takes maybe a drive or two to get used to) is outstanding and the ride is very smooth and quiet.   Comfort is great both with the seats and all the features of the climate control system and the visibility for the driver is really good, especially out of the front window where the front end is a bit lower since there is no engine.   I could go on and on about the amazing features and how the car works, but one can read about them elsewhere.   The only real drawback I have with the car is its poor integration with your smartphone (android or iphone), it's certainly not a deal breaker as there are so many other entertainment features, but would be nice to have more integration with the phone so you can control playlists and other things from the screen vs the phone itself.   Surely there will be a fix for this in an update soon, but for now you the only thing you will be underwhelmed with is the phone integration.

6 Month Update:   After owning the car for six months I have to say I enjoy it even more than I did after first getting it.  Such a fun and comfortable car to drive.   The car has gotten faster since I bought it six months ago with a software update released in March plus we are getting new features all the time.   Have not purchased gas in over six months and that is a great feeling.   Have taken a number of 200-400 mile trips and the car has done well, supercharging is quick and easy and range has been very good.   Love being able to leave the climate on in the Summer when I got into a store or restaurant as I come out and the car is nice and cool when getting into it.   The only big issue I have with the car so far is the lack of availability of service appointments.    In the DC area there are three service centers, but it's almost impossible to get an appt with them.   This is the area that Tesla needs to focus on the most I believe or it is going to start to turn away owners.

tesla,model-3,2018,dave, 08/03/2018,Driving the Future,5,"Sold my C series MB to purchase this car.  As my first EV I didn't know exactly what to expect, but after waiting for 2 years without ever even having driven the car, it has exceeded my expectations.  The interior is unlike a traditional car as are some of the driving characteristics - most particularly the regenerative braking.  The acceleration is stellar and the suspension and steering above average.  It's hard to compare to any other car since - in many respects - you are driving an iPad.  Nearly every control routes through the center screen.  I'm old (50's) but it still didn't take very long to adapt to the lack of instrument cluster, etc.  Driving visibility is quite good.  Despite the fact that I've only had it 5 months, nearly every feature has improved through periodic over-the-air software updates.  This is revolutionary and someday will be the standard.  Right now, it just really cool to receive updates that improve the interface and driving experience.  Very happy to have this car and would buy it again and again.
"
tesla,model-3,2018,Mike in Raleigh, 10/24/2018,Worth the wait,5,"Bought the Tesla Model 3 to replace my 2016 Audi A3. I totally LOVE this car.  First, it's just a beautiful car.  Second, the truly outstanding handling and immediate responsiveness of both accelerator and brake, as well as great forward visibility, inspire confidence and a sense of security in negotiating traffic whether in congested city streets or at highway speeds.  And thanks to the intuitive controls and easy-to-read touchscreen, even a techno-idiot like me can master the navigation and entertainment systems in no time.  I have owned several luxury sport sedans (Lexus, Infiniti, Audi) over the years, but this car is in a class by itself.  This is my first BEV, and I'm NEVER going back to gasoline.

tesla,model-3,2018,Jonathan Lauer, 11/02/2018,Still a spectacular car,5,"There are some big usability differences between a Tesla and other cars. As long as you are open to change and don't mind investing a little time learning about the car for a few days, you will be joyfully rewarded. It's spectacular and amazingly responsive to the driver's feet and hands. I look forward to driving the car every time I go anywhere. It performs like a sports car, but with no noise. The smart cruise control and autosteer features work great. The biggest change is having most of the controls and all the info on the 15"" screen. While it takes a bit of getting used to, the user interface is well designed and intuitive. Handling is like a sports car. Interior is comfy, sleek, simple, and well implemented, including charging dock for two phones. With rear seats down, there is lots of space for stuff. With rear seats in use, the trunk is amazingly big. Getting serious improvements to my car with every software update is amazing. My phone is my key, which simplifies life. Many useful things can be done using the smartphone  app, including climate control. Charging is simple, range is a non-issue. People say it feels like you are ""driving the future"". They're not wrong. The only thing I don't like much, though I'm used to it now, is the exterior door handles. People who are not used to them struggle to figure them out. This is small compared to the awesome things about it and as the owner it does not bother me now; it's an annoyance for people who are riding with me for the first time. Also, I miss having a sunroof. It is sadly not an option on the 3.

Update at 28,000 miles:
My model 3 is now 2 yrs old. Other than a stress crack in the rear glass roof panel that Tesla replaced free of charge and painlessly, my car has been nearly perfect. Still has about 98% of its max charge capacity, drives like a dream and With literally zero repair and zero maintenance costs. No regrets, only smiles.

tesla,model-3,2018,Nicholas, 02/06/2019,Had to be very nit-picky to find faults,5,"Traded in my 2013 BMW 328i in December 2018. First thing I noticed while driving was the car's reaction time and acceleration. Zero lag-time from pushing the pedal to moving or increasing speed. This is a quantum-leap in technology, and does take a little getting used to. For me, the adjustment period was about 2 weeks. After that, everything is smooth and feels amazing! Using the Autopilot was very weird for the first month or so. While you still have control of the vehicle, it feels strange having the car steer and navigate on its own. The Autopilot is more advanced than I thought, and has caught potential incidents I didn't. Like the title says, I had to be very nit-picky to find anything I didn't like or would improve, but here they are: The phone USB design is a great idea, but doesn't allow for you to plug in the phone with an Otter Box (though you can still plug it in using the space designed for it with a 3rd-party cord). The 12V outlet I would rather have in front with the USB/phone dock instead of in the armrest. I'd also rather have a soft-close for the frunk so that the hood wouldn't get hand-prints on it between washes.

tesla,model-3,2018,Jesse Diller, 04/01/2019,Best vehicle I’ve ever owned,5,"We purchased a mid-range model 3 in 2018 and it is hands down the best vehicle I’ve ever owned, or even driven for that matter. Powerful, smooth and quiet. It has terrific power and as it is electric/gearless there is absolutely zero lag - ever - when you press the accelerator. You sort of have to drive one to experience it. It puts a smile on my face every time I drive it. Being able to charge in the garage at night is amazing. I love leaving the house with the equivalent of a full tank of gas every day. I’ve supercharged on road trips many times now and it honestly couldn’t be any easier. I’ve never loved a car this much. We are planning to trade in our 4Runner for a second Tesla this summer.

tesla,model-3,2018,Krishna Yalamanchi, 09/22/2018,Pure Joy driving this M3,5,"Oct 2019 - this is the best damn car I have. Software updates(Tesla theater in V10, Auto Lane Change, Enhanced Summon is way too much fun and a brag topic with friends and family). Every month when the new software is released this is what I look for. I upgraded to FSD by paying $3000 extra earlier this year and waiting for service to swap out my NVIDIA GPU to a T1 chip

I had my car since Apr 2018. In a way it is like the iPhone X, you don't have a password or Touch ID anymore. No Key fob nothing to unlock or lock, no buttons to press to start engine or stop. Here is what I like so far - Sporty Drive, Long range battery, Super Charger availability, Touch screen. Here is why I will not buy an ICE anymore - Software Updates, Auto Pilot, Traffic Aware Cruise Control, Simplistic design, no tail pipe emissions. Weather there is a Federal Rebate or not it is a great buy.

The buying experience rocks, you pay a fixed $$ for new and do all the paper work at home and sign 2 docs at pickup time and done in 15 minutes. Every body pays the same price for a new car, what a concept. Hate the haggling with dealership sales people.

Forget all the hoopla about Tesla & just buy the car.

I drove 32 miles to work every day and Auto pilot makes it relaxing and fun to drive.

Finally a full charge from 0-100% costs about $7.75 at home or work in CA at 10c / KWh. Home charge is about 4 miles / hour with the 110 volt(no modification to 220v). At work we have charge point and it charges 25 miles / hr.

Super charge full charge of 300 miles costs roughly $19. 

Annual charging in CA 390$ for 15k miles at home

This is my 3rd premium car, I have an 2012 X5 purchased brand new which costed me 10K in repairs not including brakes and tires and now I wonder why did I not buy the Model S back then.

tesla,model-3,2018,Kyle, 11/27/2018,Skeptical at first... but...,5,"I love this car!!! I was skeptical at first due to having to order the car and wait... the wait is torture. I have test driven a model S before which got me hooked on Tesla, but never a Model 3 prior to me ordering it. The process was simple, I honestly appreciate the limited options, since the base price of the LR AWD already includes all the premium upgrades I want in a car. It was cheaper than the Audi S4 I was also considering, but feels wayyyyyyyyy faster than the Audi, which has competing 0-60 ratings. I thought I'd miss the awesome exhaust sounds, but I now prefer the slight electric whine during quiet rides (without music) and the pure sound from the awesome sound system. They did a great job on the premium sound!! I have not found any issues with the car, although I did have to get paint correction due to swirls and buff marks, minor issue to me. I see no cons really, however, I hope with the increase in EV's on the road there will be more destination charging options, faster options.. like for people who live in an apartment with no access to ""at home"" charging. There is a Tesla supercharger nearby but for the longevity of the battery I really need to use AC charging, minor complaint right now, its really a personal problem. Can't wait to see the enhancements to software in the years to come.

tesla,model-3,2018,Anonymous, 10/21/2018,"Look at Cost to Own, not the Sticker.",5,"I still have another ICE Vehicle, after having this for just a few weeks I can't wait to get rid of the other ICE vehicle. This thing handles the road like I've never experienced. I own the performance model, but I typically keep it in chill mode so as to avoid learning poor driving habits and tickets. I'm getting approx 340 miles range in warmer months. When I feel like playing I put in sport mode. Make sure you warn passengers and don't play right after lunch. Incentives are going away. I got free supercharging (which I DO use) and full tax credits. That plus spending so little on fuel the total price to own comes down a lot. You also have to factor in safety. How do you put a price on possibly avoiding an accident that could hurt a loved one. Don't let the center screen scare you. It's very well designed. Lot's of in experienced people don't know all the shortcuts on the steering wheel and the user interface thinking ahead of you. It's not distracting at all. It's also huge so you can see things easily. No filling up with fossil fuel, No oil changes, rarely any brakes, no real tune up. My only complaint is it could be better on tire noise, it's not bad, but could be better.

tesla,model-3,2018,Docdeb, 11/02/2018,CAR GETS BETTER WITH ADDED FEATURES-FREE,5,"I was nervous about the computer screen, seeing it easily and maneuvering it.

tesla,model-3,2018,Alan Storch, 08/07/2018,Whisper quiet. Instant acceleration,5,"My thoughts before owning a Tesla M3 was always the range and the availability of charging on the road. All of that was for naught. I live in South east Florida and there are Super Chargers all around me. The car I purchased has extended range of 310 miles (more if you drive conservatively and use the regenerative braking). Every night the car goes in the garage and gets plugged in. Every morning it is fully charged to go 310 miles. My average daily trip is 50-75 miles. My ICE car is almost never filled and has considerably less range. Elon Musk has started the future of automobile travel. Luxury performance at a comparable price with 1/6th the fuel cost and with safety galore.
The car is amazingly quiet. Driving is a joy. Passing speed is amazing.

tesla,model-3,2018,MG, 11/26/2019,"Fun car, horrible reliability and service centers!",2,"First, as everyone says this car changes driving for the better in every way; BUT, and a huge but here is that this car is horrendously put together. Additionally, the parts break easy and the vehicles is comprised of many cheap plastic pieces. Once you get through that, the vehicle is constantly having parts fail which require to deal with the most absurd customer service I’ve ever dealt with in my entire life. To add a cherry on top, my warranty was denied on my seat stitching falling a part on my 9th month of ownership. I was told it was normal wear and tear. 

I loved this car and had been waiting for it to be delivered for over 2 years. I would never buy another Tesla vehicle on its first year of release. In fact, I’d wait no less than 3 years of the vehicles model before Tesla figures out the common issues. 

Take my advice and buy a Toyota or Honda.

tesla,model-3,2018,Chris, 01/20/2019,Nothing compares to this car,5,"I had been looking at various Hybrid cars, however a test drive in November and the excitement of my kids convinced me to get this car and I am glad I did!  Now I look forward to my daily commute and any opportunity to drive this car.  The Model3 is simply amazing – phenomenal acceleration, quietness, comfort, features, as well as a high-end sound system ... all in addition to the environment friendly concept of EVs.  Almost all functions in this car are customizable and the forward looking hardware design allows ongoing software developments (transmitted through wireless updates) to further enhance this car. In my opinion the Model3 does not only compete with much more expensive cars, it is also way ahead of its time. There is simply nothing out there that compares with the Model3 (with the exception of the S or X).

The car is comfortable for a family of four and has lots of storage space. Got very quickly used to the touchscreen functionality and charging with the Tesla wall-charger is super easy (44-45 miles per hour charge). All my driving is within the 300mile battery range and charging it over night gets me started with a full “tank” in the morning. Also with Tesla’s  Supercharging network I have no concerns of taking longer road trips. 

Just could not justify the extra $5k for the Enhanced Auto Pilot option. Tesla provided a 30-day trial period of the EAP function and I have to admit that this is a super cool feature. Not yet full autonomous driving but there is currently no other car that offers anything even close to Tesla’s EAP.  Still I did not purchased this option because 1) I enjoy driving, 2) my commute is mainly on country roads that are not fully recognized by EAP sensors/cameras, and 3) while the EAP system accurately keeps the car in the center of the lane, I prefer to maintain more of a safety margin when passing trucks, especially in NJ driving. That said, it works very well with stop-and-go traffic or less crowded long-distance highway driving. 

Anyway this brings me to my only critical point. While Adoptive Cruise Control has become a standard safety feature in much less expensive cars (e.g. Jetta, Accord, etc.), it is in the Model3 only available with the $5k EAP option.  As this feature is controlled through software it is unfortunate that Tesla does not offer this as a standard feature in a $55k+ car. Can only hope that this it will be added as a basic feature in one of the next software updates.

Update: July 21, 2019  - drove 8,000 miles since the above review. I am still super happy with the Model3, the car continues to get better and better with every software update! Since the last review Tesla listend and decided to offer Autopilot (with Adoptive Cruise Control and Autosteer) as standard feature on all new Model3s. I unfortunatley had to pay for the upgrade but the added functionality is worth it as it makes long distance highway driving much more relaxing. With Tesla's  supercharging there is absolutely no need for range anxiety. The navigation system makes it easy to find charging locations and charging is quick. It even gets better with the new upgraded V3 chargers that have a 1,000 mile per hour charging speed. Also with more Teslas on the road, the supercharging network continues to expand. While there are a number of new supercharging stations in my area (in service and in construction phase), I generally use my home charger to ""fill up"" over night.  The cost for a 100 mile trip is about $3.50 even in NJ where electricity costs are generally high (using the Supercharger is about $7.00). It also nice to no longer worry about engine service, oil changes, spark plugs, etc. ...

tesla,model-3,2018,Jim Stack, 03/27/2019,Tesla model 3 world leader,5,"We have had a Tesla model 3 since March of 2018. Some complain about the quality. Ours was perfect from day one. I think that was because we picked it up at the factory in California, so no transport damage or chips and scraps.   The first month we had it my wife's 3 relatives came to visit. We drove from Chandler to Tucson and visited both Saguaro desert preserves and back. They were from Seattle so we had the Air Cond on 68F. We went over 350 miles on 1 charge ,mostly at highway 75 MPH speeds with no problem. At a Super Charger it recharged in less than 1 hour while we got something to eat.                                                                          The only thing I don't like about our model 3 is the Sunroof that gets HOT and doesn't open. I have covered it with the Tesla solar screen insert but I still will cover the outside with a wrap to match the car and keep the Sun's heat out in our Chandler-Phoenix area. I would also like the rear to be a full hatch back with a larger opening. Other than that the car exceeds all my expectations.

tesla,model-3,2018,Armen Khachatryan, 10/23/2018,TESLA's DECEPTIVE AND DISHONEST SALES PRACTICES,1,". I have always liked Teslas and support the concept of clean electric cars. Elon Musk is a visionary and I want to see this brilliant idea succeed. When my wife performed a test drive recently, the local Tesla representative in Salt Lake City touted how they do things differently from other manufacturers. I took that as a positive, but as it turns out from my sister's recent experience, it is the opposite. They are more deceptive than other automakers. When I was visiting my sister in LA at the end of September, after months of deliberation and driving an 18-year-old Lexus, I talked her into ordering the Model 3. While normally she is not impulsive, she went online, designed her new Model 3 and could not wait to get her BRAND NEW CAR. Two days ago, on October 19, instead of getting a brand new car delivered to her, Tesla delivered a service loaner with over 2100 miles on it, with scratches, dirty interior and expected her to accept the delivery. If this is not worse than a cheap used car dealer bait-and-switch, dirty tactic, I don't know what is. The guy delivering the car even asked her if she knew that the car had over 2100 miles on it and her answer was ""of course no"". She tried all day calling her sales consultant but got no answer with a voicemail that was so full that would not accept any new voicemails. If anyone from Tesla is reading this post (her reservation number is RN109185359), please correct the situation or the bad press that I will spread will be my mission in life. And I will not shy away from spending my money to do so. My sister works much too hard for her money to deal with this kind of downright dishonest, deceptive, dirty car sales tactic. TESLA....I expected better from you. I am having a really hard time believing that something like this can happen and am truly disappointed."
tesla,model-3,2018,Ted, 01/19/2019,What Owners Aren't Telling You,4,"I have owned the car now just over a month and it is an amazing car. My review is based on what others are overlooking and not telling you. There are definitely some cool features with the car, but some do not come standard for a car that is being marketed as technology advanced. 

Edmonds gives the car an A in technology, but I believe this is deceiving, as you must pay for Enhance Auto Pilot (EAP), which is a $5k option. Traffic aware cruise control, also known as adaptive cruise control (ACC) is not standard, which is a shock given there are many cars under $25k that are now offering this as standard. EAP comes with some cool features, but beware that the features that make it semi-autonomous are in beta. Tesla gives owners who did not purchase EAP a trial period for 30 days, so it’s 100% software as all cars have the hardware. I would suggest not opting for it at initial purchase and do the trial period to see if it’s worth the $5k. I declined not to purchase after my trial period, as I just could not see the value at this time for an overpriced ACC and features that are still in beta. 

Auto Steer (beta) comes with EAP and the function works in straight line, but hate the swaying feeling like I’m swerving back and forth. The feature has trouble understand which lane/direction to go when the lane splits for highway interchanges, such as an HOV interchange. It’s not clear if using the turn signals would help in selecting the direction as instructions are unclear and had different outcomes when I engaged the feature. This function is in beta and it acts as such.

Auto Navigate (beta) comes with EAP and a cool concept, but the navigation did not recognize the HOV lanes in my area. My route to work involves several HOV interchanges to the freeways in the Phoenix area, but the navigation only routes using the normal interchanges. When I first tried the feature, which I do not suggest during rush hour, it scared me as the car started to cross 5 lanes to follow the route mapped rather than staying in the HOV lane and taking the HOV interchange. I tried it one more time during a lighter traffic day and same experience. Ever since, I have not engaged this feature as too dangerous to cross 5 lanes. I blame it on Google maps for not recognizing the HOV lanes, so if this is updated it may be worth it. 

Navigation as mentioned above does not always pick the best route and has trouble selecting HOV lanes. This is more likely a Google issue. I do love the big screen and it’s easy to see the map. I have had issues with the voice control on multiple occasions as it did not recognize my request. I either had to type the location on the screen or used my phone’s navigation and shared to the Tesla.

Braking – I can defiantly tell that it takes longer distance to stop the car unless the sensor’s engages emergency braking. This was apparent on two occasions when there wasn’t a car in front of me and when there was. Without a car in front of me it felt like the brakes did not full engage even though it felt like the pedal was as far as I could push. When there was a car in front of me I was concerned I was going to rear end them, but then the pedal went a little further right at the end and the the brakes fully engaged. It’s nice to know the car will stop in those instances, but it’s also scary that the brakes don’t fully engage unless it’s an emergency. 

The exterior paint is pretty, but it shows every finger smug so either you have to clean it constantly or just live with seeing fingerprints. This also applies to the center console as it has a glossy finish that shows fingerprints. This too must be constantly cleaned with a cloth unless again you can live with those smudges. The exterior paint is also prone to easily chip as within my first week of owning the car I had three rock chips in the hood. 

The phone app is the best way to access
 your car. The app allows you to access the climate control to either pre-cool or heat your vehicle, which is a great feature in Phoenix during the summer. The bad is that the car does take quite a bit of time to wake up in the app, which varies during the day between 25-70 seconds. It seems the longer times are during peak usage, but it’s not consistent. There have been a few times the car does not detect my phone even when I try to open the doors or access the rear trunk, so I have to take the phone out of my pocket and open the app for it to unlock. On two occasions the car still would not unlock, so had to turn off my Bluetooth on my phone and then turn back on for the car and app to recognize each other and unlock my doors.

There is no place to put your sunglasses, but you can purchase a tray that goes into the center console on Amazon.

tesla,model-3,2018,M.Martin, 11/27/2018,I've had the Model 3 for 2 years,5,"I've been a BMW driver for years. My last BMW was a 330e. It was a good hybrid, but not much range.. about 14 miles on electric. Still, a joy to drive.  The Tesla Model 3 is a revelation. After almost a month of ownership I still can't wait to get back in the car. Autopilot works, but you need to pay attention. But it reduces the load on the driver. There are little things that could be better, and I'm sure software updates will fix this. My iPhone doesn't really integrate well. Even though there are 2 audio equipped USB ports up front, music has to come via BT on the iPhone. There's no Siri integration. (My BMW had a button to initiate Siri.) Entertainment system doesn't drop in volume for navigation announcements, an easy fix, but not here yet. Overall, a great step up from my BMWs. Everyone who drives it wants one. 
********
Update: Now after a bit more than one year I'm still very pleased. My only physical issue with the car has been a loose interior trim piece. The Tesla Ranger came to my house and replaced it in about 5 minutes. Turns out Tesla had improved the clips and my older clips were replaced. Tesla has added a lot of tech in software updates. It's surely the best car I have ever owned and it has greatly exceeded my high expectations. Love it on long trips and the Supercharger experience is first rate.

Update- 2 years old now. Still love it. Best car and experience ever. Need to have 12 volt battery replaced. Was done under warranty. Was never stranded as I got an early warning on Tesla screen.

Beautiful vehicle. Handled the New England winter just fine with snow tires all around. Great fit and finish. Absolutely no complaints. Amazing technology.
Update: 04/01/2020
     Still impressed at 10,000 miles. Over the air software updates and performance updates have been easy and great. One service update done in my driveway by the Tesla mobile tech. Adjusted the frunk alignment and replaced charging pins.  No charge. I keep getting more impressed.

tesla,model-3,2018,Z, 02/24/2020,Best car I've ever owned in 40+ years of driving..,5,"My 2018 Tesla Model 3 Performance is simply an amazing vehicle.  Its combination of performance, comfort, versatility an efficiency is unmatched in the marketplace.
It's ridiculously quick, handles extremely well, is comfortable and has an outstanding infotainment system that immediately makes all other makers' systems seem quaint and obsolete.  The audio system is also among the best I've ever heard in any vehicle, despite it not being ""branded"".
The 2 things I'd improve if I could are the interior road noise level in freeway driving and the ride comfort over sharp bumps.  It's louder than it could/should be on the highway, but this is extremely road-surface dependent.  On smooth asphalt it's really quiet, but textured concrete is loud.
The ride is sports-sedan taught, which is fantastic for handling, but less so for passenger-ferrying duties.  It's not objectionable - it's just maybe not as refined overall as it might be.
Still, on balance even after 14 months of ownership, I still look for excuses to drive it, and it is indeed the best car I've ever owned.

Top that off with HOV access here in CA and we may be looking at the perfect car.

Ride, acceleration, handling, comfort, safety, autopilot (which is constantly improved with over the air updates) this car has the WOW factor. 1 year later, I still feel the same way and the car software  updates just keep making it better.

I never write reviews and will keep this short. The power rates where I live cost me $1.70 to go 300 miles in a thrilling car to drive with amazing thought, programming and comfort. I get to drive it like I stole it whenever I want with extreme instant torque. Every little detail seems to have been thought through, and if you’re contemplating this car and have the money for it, do it.

I can't speak to reliability as I have only had it 1 month and only driven it about 600 miles.

6 month anniversary update- It is amazing. I love this car. It is fun to drive, although you have to watch your speed.

Other things to notice is how you keep getting better stuff for your car with OTA updates, it is something unique in the industry, it keeps you excited with your car because you get new features in regular bases or range improvements, or fixes to existent issues.

tesla,model-3,2018,Keith Violette, 07/08/2019,Tesla Spaceship from the Future!,5,"Update 7/10/2020 ~19 months of ownership:
While there have been a couple issues, water in rear taillight, rear glass cracked, they were both covered under warranty.
Sentry mode captured on video when a coworker backed into the car and drove away. I sent her (& HR) an email of the incident on video, and her insurance company, Geico, covered the repair, but they were a PITA to deal with.
We now have 31k miles, and still love the car. There has been a second 5% power boost, and tons of other software updates that keep making the car better and better.
We plan to replace our Silverado with a Cybertruck, and have one reserved. EVs, especially Teslas, are the future.
End update.

WARNING - People should know that test driving this car will ruin them for all other ICE cars.

Purchase and pick-up:
We test drove a Model S and a Model 3 on August 8th, 2018, and placed an order for a Performance Model 3 when we returned to the showroom that same day.  It was only our second new car that we have ever purchased (I am my own mechanic and have been buying used and repairing for the last 28 years), and it was just over twice the price of our previous new car purchase, a 2013 WRX.  The WRX held its value well, and was sold private sale before we picked up the Tesla on November 9th.  Two weeks before the arranged pick-up, the price was REDUCED $5500 - Thanks Elon!  As there are no showrooms in our state (NH) so we opted to pick up the car near NYC after getting a Enterprise rental (covered by Tesla).  The first day we kept the car on ""Chill"" mode, but we haven't turned that back on since - it stays on ""Sport"".  The  instantaneous acceleration is very addictive, right from the start.  It's a rocket!  I do have to admit, there was some range anxiety at first, but that soon disappeared as we took a 800 mile weekend road trip with the car down through NYC and NJ before heading home to NH.  Plenty of chargers, no worries at all.  We even overnight charged at the Hampton Inn we stayed at.

So Far:
9 months and 13k miles later, and we LOVE the car even more.  It gets regular software updates - really UPGRADES regularly.  We now have 5% more power than when new, higher top speed, quicker acceleration, more fun video games, built-in dash and side cameras, amazing sentry mode, etc...  My wife and I negotiate who gets to drive it each day.  Yes, we both already want a second one.

What friends and family say:
I have taken dozens of friends and family for rides, all of them get the ""Tesla Grin"" when I mash the accelerator pedal and they sink backward into the seats, usually loudly exclaiming phrases I shouldn't express in a review.  Many of them are ""gear-heads"" having racing experience, some have meticulously restored Corvettes, built sub-10 second race cars, or built rally cars.  All of them are impressed with the car - the Tech, the performance AND the incredible safety ratings.

Operational costs:
It costs 3.4 times less per mile to drive than our Silverado truck, and NH electricity is fairly expensive.  For comparison, we drive this car 50% more than the WRX and it costs half that much to operate.  As we ordered early, it helps that we received free supercharging for the life of the car, so no ""fuel"" costs for road trips.  

Conclusion:
This is our favorite car EVER.  It has blown us away and we won't ever consider purchasing another ICE vehicle again.  I hope to sell our truck and upgrade to a Tesla truck or a Rivian once they are in production.

tesla,model-3,2018,Tommy, 06/15/2019,UNREAL car - update,5,"I have owned the Long Range RWD Model 3 for over a year now. It is hard to describe just how much better this car is than any other car created. It is something you just have to drive and see and learn about to appreciate. I feel compelled to write a review to inform people who are uninformed, misinformed, or do not give Tesla a chance because of the negative coverage and wild expectations of their cars and company. Tesla does not advertise-  so word of mouth, referrals, and reviews/information are very important. Anyway, now to the car: Unbelievable technology- perfect? No, but 5 years ahead of any other car on market. I love the 15” touchscreen- You get used to it quickly and forget about a normal car instrument panels within a few days. The Navigation is awesome. It is Ridiculously fun to drive. Dead quiet. Amazing sound system. Bigger than it looks- great storage space in trunk and great legroom in backseat, extra storage in the front trunk under the hood also. Very comfortable seats. So easy to drive and operate, no shifting or gears, hardly any effort to maneuver, you can even have it drive for you with enhanced autopilot (still need to pay attention and be ready to take over). Regenerative braking is awesome as it does most of the braking for you which preserves the life of your brakes. No oil changes ever, it’s a battery with a motor and awesome computer basically. Minimal service necessary, and if you do have a problem they have mobile technicians that come to you to assess and perform repairs. Over the air updates allow for periodic upgrades to software. This car when I bought it had less features than it does now in 2019. I receive the latest and greatest improvements whenever they are available. This creates less of a need to upgrade your car every 3-5 years since you are getting the same features as the latest versions continuously over time. Charging is so simple and far cheaper than gasoline- fill your battery in the privacy of your own garage/home unless you are on a long trip, in which case there are super chargers in many convenient locations popping up everywhere (also ridiculously simple to do, just takes longer than filling up tank of gas but cheaper and WORTH IT). People complain about high price tag of the Model 3, which is just ignorance. First of all, when is the last time you REALLY shopped for a car? Because Unfortunately $30K barely gets you a midsized sedan with basic essentials anymore. Frankly, the Model 3 for between $37-$47K depending on battery range is unbelievable. If I drove this car not knowing anything about the price or brand etc. I would assume it is a $75-$100K car based on finishes, drive experience, performance, features, technology etc. There is no comparison to the antiquated, inefficient, unreliable, arsenal of cookie cutter pieces of plastic with normal and/or luxury badging period. I would take this car over anything else, yes even a Lambo or Bugatti supercar- for obvious price differences. This is an exciting, innovative car, from an American company and I can’t wait for Model Y and pickup truck to hit the market in the next year or two.

tesla,model-3,2018,Srini, 05/04/2019,Thank god I did not buy a Porsche.,5,"I was angling for a Porsche 911 and than God I did not buy that car. This is an amazing car. Nothing comes close -period. I have owned five mercedes cars. This is awesome in terms of performance, fabulous in terms of acceleration and brilliant technology. Just went on a 500 mile road trip with auto pilot for most of the way. I have a steep ramp - a bit of a hassle to merge with trucks hurtling down. Now I zoom up the steep ramp at 80mph and slow down to merge -) Unreal. Several software updates. Just read about cool stuff in keeping you in lane even without auto pilot. Car is getting better all the time. Unreal. No regular maintenance. I barely use the brake due to regenerative braking - just foot off the pedal. Brakes may last 100K miles. Now they are saying this car will last 500K miles. As per Elon, 1 million miles. Eventually, this will cost me the same as a Camry. I will only buy Teslas and I have already ordered the new SUV. Most of my friends have bought one and they all love it. I know one who already has 3 Teslas (including a gorgeous white interior SUV) and has ordered a roadster! This is an amazing car. Test drive one before you buy a merc, bimmer etc. Just see the amazing reviews. Goodluck!

tesla,model-3,2018,Lester Haynes, 05/14/2019,Driving toward the future,5,"Every time I get in this car, it's with anticipation and excitement. After 8 months of ownership, this is still the case; driving the Model 3 is an experience that can't be replicated with any other car. When you're in the driver's seat, you feel one with the road. The minimal interior allows the car around you to completely fade away, as you find that you're somehow transformed into a being that exists to drive. Once you put your foot on the pedal, you'll realize that every whim and desire is immediately translated into action, as you find yourself exactly where you want to be on the road, rather than trying to get where you want to be. I've driven other electric vehicles, I've driven sporty compact sedans, and a share of full size luxury sedans. Nothing else balances the nimbleness of the Model 3's handling, with the fast-twitch response time of its pedals, all while providing a fully satisfying heft that gives you confidence that you could hold your own should something terrible happen out there. I have the Performance, but that's after trading up from a Long Range. Everything I've stated is true for both versions, with the exception of the amount of power at your command. The TechCrunch review stated ""this is a driver’s car, built not just for people who know they love to drive, but also for people who might not be aware of how much fun it can be"". Prior to owning this car, driving was just a way to get from A to B. But with the Model 3, you'll find yourself wanting to get out more, and (provided you source your energy from renewables), without the worry about this action harming the health of your fellow human beings. Notice that I've said nothing so far about autopilot (it's great and getting better every day), about delightful new features regularly dropping overnight (feels like I'm a kid at Christmas), or about the Tesla Supercharging network (you'll adore your new lifestyle of making your trip about the journey again, rather than just the destination). All these things are nice, and I see them as an immense moat for Tesla's competition to cross... but the reality is that even without them, the Model 3 still holds its own. Tesla as a company could completely fold tomorrow, and there'd be enough good about this car, and enough passionate owners to propel support forward for decades to come. As others have said: It's not without its flaws. The fit and finish could be a bit more polished than other cars in its price range, it has bugs here and there, but even with its flaws, and even with the potential to have to wait long periods for Tesla to fix them, there's simply no other car out there that inspires the same feeling. That's why I encourage everyone I meet to buy a Model 3, to support Tesla and our sustainable future, to take the quirks in stride, while simultaneously enjoying the best experience on the road possible as they drive (very quickly) toward the future.
"
tesla,model-3,2018,Lawrence Wierzbowski, 05/18/2019,Model 3 proves to me Electric is here to stay,5,"For superior performance, safety, style, reliability, and (surprisingly) economy,  the Model 3 is a car you *Must* consider for your driving needs. If you own a home or live in an apartment where you can install your own electric charger the economy of electric will be very kind to your pocket book.  Adding to economic efficacy, is that fact that service is essentially non-existent. I have only paid $80 to switch my winter tires to regular tires and that is the **only** needed service in over 7000 miles. This car is the safest  vehicle ever made and that is important to guard those close to me. Auto-Pilot assist when used as directed by Tesla, actually enhances the safety of your highway driving by adding the 10 or so visual cameras, the 10 ultrasonic sensors and the radar to your visual input and thus optimizes your own driving skills. In addition, the stress of driving in high traffic and stop and go situations in very minimized and you will be less stressed and less tired than driving the tradition car.  Without reservation, I give the Tesla Model 3 my highest recommendation.     The sound system rocks and is the best ever.

tesla,model-3,2018,Todd, 06/23/2019,Wicked performance,5,"Update: One full year later and love the car even more. The car has literally improves via continuous software updates. No other car on the market can match it in my estimation. 

I’ve had mine for a few weeks now and it never ceases to amaze me. Stepping in to drive this thing is a joy every single time. Never gets old. Off the line takeoff is truly wicked. Makes me smile every single time.

Update: The car is still amazing. In many ways, it feels as if I’m driving a newer car. OTA updates make a huge difference. Now have Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify integration. Faster performance, the new hold feature where you no longer need to use the mechanical brakes whatsoever. AutoPilot has gotten smarter with updates as well. This is all because Tesla pushes software updates to its fleet regularly.

tesla,model-3,2018,Louie, 06/28/2019,And yet... Edmunds editors recommend the Kona,5,"If you want a sedan, and you were planning on spending around $40k to 50k, this is your vehicle.  You can save a sizable wad of cash by not opting for the Full Self Driving option.  But you'll miss out on a lot of cool features.  Is she fast?  You've never heard of the Model 3?  It's the car that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. It's outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man.  0 to 60mph launches never get old.  If you want to spend time on the track or hang with the big boys on the autobahn, get the performance version.  Acceleration in that trim is said to ""hurt your eyeballs"".  The Kona does look good if you want a CUV.  If you just don't like Tesla but want quality, performance and range - look at a Volvo Polestar.

tesla,model-3,2018,Harold F., 01/19/2020,Love my Model 3!!!!,5,"I am not particularly a car guy, and I’m not even that big a tech guy. But this thing is awesome. I find myself looking for excuses to run errands just so I can be in the car.  The handling is great, the acceleration is amazing, the features are endless, and you get new ones added regularly with software updates.  I love the minimalism of the interior.  Some say that the center display is distracting, but I really don’t find it that way.  I prefer it to luxury cars that have buttons and lights everywhere.  It only took me about an hour of driving to adjust to the display.  It is slightly unnerving, particularly early on, that there are no Iights whatsoever behind or around the steering wheel when you are driving at light.  I read reviews that storage space is limited, but i completely don’t understand that - the trunk is huge, has a lower level storage space under the main trunk, has the frunk, and with the back seats down, you can fit a ton in the car.  The sound system is amazing.  The seats are super comfortable.  But most of all, it is just the overall experience. A friend who drives a Model S told me that he feels like he is going on an amusement park ride rather than a drive each time.  I get what he means.  Finally, there were definitely some glitches early on.  My phone didn’t open the car for the first three weeks or so, and customer service couldn’t help.  It finally cleared up with one of the software updates.  My charger had a defect and had to be replaced.  Every now and then, I’ll lose a non-critical feature for a few hours.  But that all pales to the overall experience.  I also had none of the fit and finish issues that others have complained about.  One tip: replace the flimsy floor mats that one with the car.  I have a rubberized one now that is custom fit to the car.  Great car!

tesla,model-3,2018,Downriver Detroit, 01/24/2020,Tesla redefines the car experience,5,"Owning my Tesla Model 3 has been a daily thrill for the past 13 months, quiet, smooth, efficient, no maintenance, handles like its on rails, unshakable traction control and stick that makes me feel like Mario Andretti. Every time I drive get into my car and drive out of my garage I hear Yello's Oh Yeah (see Ferrari scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Truly, it is that much fun. 

I’ve actually driven more miles this past year because my Tesla is so convenient and inexpensive to take on road trips. I routinely drive my Autopilot equipped (standard not FSD) private transport pod rather than jump on the cattle cars we call modern commercial aviation. I get to stay connected at the office, home, listen to podcasts and books on tape with my ultra-connected Tesla. Autopilot keeps me centered in my lane, away from slowing cars in front and up to date when I'll get to the next Supercharger. I've even conducted an online goto-meeting while stuck in bumper to bumper traffic in Cincinnati, Autopilot handled it all. I arrive refreshed rather than tired. When's the last time that happened on a long drive? 

Even though I pay each time I do Supercharge, the cost is low, $0.025/mile rate for electricity usually less than $10 for a full charge to get me to my next stop. (Detroit to Nashville was <$30 in Superchargers fees each way). Also I get to expense $0.56/mile mileage so I actually make money traveling (That trip to Nashville was more than $500 in my pocket AND less expensive than Delta flight.) I don't know who the super travelers are that think a 500 mile range on a gas car is usable when they have to stop every 3-4 hours for food and bio-break. A typical charge is 15-25 minutes on the V2 charges (150 kW) which is faster than I can hit the restroom, order a meal and be back on my way. The newest V3 Superchargers are 250kW rate are getting rolled out and will trim the average charge time to 10-15 minutes. (All Tesla Models 3s are equipped to use the future V3 Superchargers, Tesla seems to think ahead on many items.) Oh I only use Supercharger network on road trips because normal charge handled via a 240 volt charger (same as an electric oven plug) in my garage. Charging plug in literally takes 5 seconds after I park my car. I can't tell you how nice it is to avoid standing in the cold wind to fill my gas tank in Michigan winters! 

I've owned and driven some of the iconic cars: Mustang GTs, Corvettes, Cadillac CTS V, Subaru Outback AWD, Volkswagon Passat TDI, Chevy Volt Premium ( can you tell when the kids arrived?) and this car beats every one of them in their best aspect: Better acceleration than a Mustang SVT, more comfortable than CTS-V with more passenger and truck space, better track handling than a Corvette, better winter grip than a Subaru Outback (AWD); more efficient than my Passat TDI and more range than my Chevy Volt.  Add on to this virtually no maintenance, no oil changes. The traction control is so good even getting on it frequently (like every day) my tires are past 25k and still have 50% life. I used to spend $2000 each year on tires for my CTS-V, 2 x full synthetic oil changes at $90 each, all memories now. I spent $600 on added electricity charging my car at home in 2019 for more than, wait for it, 27,000 miles driven! Boom! I love saving money and sticking it to the oil company man! 

Ok, the last item is the Over the Air updates. My Tesla actually gets better with time, every 4-6 weeks I get a new software download (happens just like my computer update late at night while I’m sleeping) that improves charging experience, improved automatic wipers, adds more entertainment features (latest was Spotify), improves AutoPilot since its constantly aggregating all the learning from drivers (more than 500k on the road now), improves my connected cell phone app, (it tells me where in a parking lot I’m parked, accurate within 10
 ft!)…. And I don’t need to pay extra for this connectivity like I had to with my Chevy Volt for OnStar, so 1990s! 

Buy one you’ll not regret it.

tesla,model-3,2018,John, 02/01/2020,Technology integration second to none.,5,"Now that OTA has provided Bluetooth message integration, any pretense that Mobile platform integration beyond modern Bluetooth support should just be abandoned.

The built in phone charging dock is awesome and should get more credit in the reviews.  

The technology integration of the touchscreen terrific.  There is nothing I want from Android Auto or Car Play. The soft button bar along the bottom edge, looks and funtions like dedicated buttons.  I can use these while keeping my eyes on the road, and now the latest OTA updates to voice commands means that I can also keep my hands the wheel.  It is very infrequent that I change any setting while driving, but since OTA refinements have been disciplined, I never need to search for controls.

I have been thoroughly enjoying this car since May 2018.   Almost ready to replace original tires after 20 months and 39,000 miles.

Trips of over 600 miles each way are effortless.

In short, this car is still awesome!

tesla,model-3,2019,Cameron Garrett, 01/26/2019,"After 8 months and 40k miles, Best car ever!",5,"UPDATE JULY 2019
Still absolutely loving this car, in fact it’s the best car I have ever owned. I have 40k miles after 8 months so anyone who says “the range won’t work for me” just hasn’t thought it through. The EV paradigm is completely different from the gas paradigm. With a gas car, you drive until near empty, stop to fill up, rinse and repeat. With an EV, you take 30 seconds to plug in at night and wake up to a full charge the next day. For most people that’s it, way more convenient than a gas car (and “fuel” is much cheaper!). When you travel long distances, as I do every week, you stop at a Tesla Supercharger (which are now everywhere) for 15 to 20 minutes and then off you go. In the time it takes to use the bathroom and grab a cup of coffee or snack you’ll add 100 to 125 miles of range. And remember with the long range Model 3 you start with 300 miles so with just 2 quick stops you are able to drive 500 miles in a day. For me personally, if I have to drive more than 500 miles I’ll either break the trip into 2 days or take a plane instead. When you stay in a hotel overnight you simply choose one that has an EV charger and again you wake up in the morning to a full charge. With the exception of a few very remote areas (like North Dakota) you can drive a Tesla on any trip you want. 

And as I mentioned before, it is far cheaper to fuel a Tesla or any EV than a gas car. My Model 3 costs me $0.03 per mile for electricity (that’s a combination of home charging and supercharging, with supercharging costing more than home). The car I replaced (a Mazda CX-9) was costing me $0.12 per mile, so every mile I drive saves me $0.09 in fuel. I’ve driven this car 40k miles so far so in less than a year I have saved $3600 in gas. Plus no oil changes ever!  Is the car expensive?  You bet, but calculate the TCO (total cost of ownership) and this car is cheaper than a well equipped Toyota Camry. About the size and utility of a Camry and WAY more fun to drive!  

Bottom line, if you’re thinking about a Model 3 and can afford it, just do it!  You will never regret the purchase.

tesla,model-3,2019,CaliforniaMike22, 04/25/2019,"Amazing Performance, Technology, and Value.",5,"This truly feels like a car from the future. The level of performance, handling, technology, and the overall experience leaves me smiling every single time I drive it.

It's hard to overstate how much of a difference it is to drive a Model 3 when compared to a gas-powered car. My most recent cars have been BMW's and AUDI's and they've been great, however, this feels like a very difference experience.

It's quiet. The handling is intuitive and sharp. The acceleration is responsive and mind-blowing. And when you don't feel like dealing with traffic, just turn on the AutoPilot and arrive to your destination rested and feeling great.

If you're trying to decide between the different versions of the Model 3, I can offer you this helpful advice: just about the only meaningful differences between them are the range and acceleration.

Even the Standard Range model is plenty fast - the instant torque and responsive motor make the Model 3 feel like a much quicker car than a comparable gas-guzzler. However, if you appreciate sports-car like acceleration, you'll be very happy with the AWD or the AWD Performance.

This car is truly a dream come true because I didn't think I'd own such a high-performing car that is truly a good 5-10 years ahead of the competition. The amount of value you get for the money is amazing.

So if you're considering a Model 3 - don't think, go out and try one. You'll be hooked instantly.

tesla,model-3,2019,Ken, 02/24/2019,The most revolutionary vehicle in our lifetimes.,5,"This car is in a class of it's own. There are other BEV's yes, but this one has a range over 300miles and insane power and acceleration.  Unlike the Model S and Model X this isn't an ultra exclusive car, it's a car for the people, the VW Bug, or Model T of it's time.  This makes it more attractive to me than any ultra-lux brand. Ours has been 100% reliable, with zero issues. I love the minimalist approach, the connected features, the software nature of the car.  The personas of 'mad max' distinguish this car from the hum-drum brands and give it a real edge.  Interior quality is on par with BMW's MINI brand, and the seats seem to use the exact same vegan leather. The engineering is years ahead of most, including the battery and drive system, though BMW's i3 has a more advanced body shell. Auto pilot, with on-ramp to off-ramp control is exceptional.  The 1 pedal operation, possible with regen braking is awesome.  The ground clearance is low - but it makes it look so much better. Tesla's supercharging network is great - allowing 400 mph charging on trips, whilst 60AMP charging at home, allows charging 2-3 times per week for just 4-5 hrs on average.   With electric at 7c KWh it costs about $3 for 260 miles of range, that's just so cheap.  Lastly, not having to wait at the pump gives you valuable time back to use as you please.  Update 2/2020  still waiting for Full Self Driving capability, but still very pleased with this car.

tesla,model-3,2019,MarkN, 04/22/2019,Model 3 Plus/Minus LR RWD 2018 model,4,"Ok. My nephew convinced me to test drive a Model 3. I didn't think I'd go for it. But, oh boy. After one drive? With torque that beat the he!! out of my Ford Cmax Energi? OMG. I had no choice. Ok - here are the Pluses and minuses:

Plus:  
Excellent handling! 
Adjustable / adaptive cruise control
Immersive sound system
Luggage space is immense. Frunk/trunk/hidden spot in trunk holds heaps!
Easy to recharge at home - can be ""scheduled"" via phone
Phone app IS your car key. No need to turn ""off"" the car. Just put in Park and walk away to lock!
Reliable- no service visits (though the monitor will re-boot unexpectedly at times)
Over the air software updates w/new games, web browsers, new vehicle functionality
Summon - though limited now, it's a great parlor trick
Easy to drive, and addictive handling/power. 
People love the car. No one cared when I had the Ford Cmax Energi. They care with the Tesla!
Instant respect from the washeros at my local car wash - this car gets babied!
All-glass roof is fantastic
Autopilot is mostly fantastic, as long as  you don't trust it ""too"" much
Cheap to drive, great to drive past gas pumps
Comfortable seating with lots of storage in the front console
Sentry mode, dog mode, dashcam (all recently downloaded functionality!)
Regerative braking is intense and hard to get used to- but it's phenomenol!

Minuses:
No AM radio (HD on FM helps when simulcasting my local all-news station)
No SiriusXM (wtf). I can stream it, but why?
No offline navigational maps - I found out the hard way in the Mojave National Preserve)
Tesla superchargers aren't always functional nor as fast as expected. 
Occasionally glitchy monitor will reboot itself while your driving. Disconcerting at best, scary at worst. 
Outside door handles are stylish but when you need to push and pull to open?  That's too much, I think. One or the other, not both. 
No spare tire (Iknow, I know). 
Takes weeks to schedule a service check (though to be fair the car's never needed service, but what if it did?).
Going thru a hand car wash demands you sit in the car (tow mode isn't recommended) - costs extra to get thru the wash unfortunately. 
Navigation ""zoom"" is not controllable and often zooms WAY out, even though I prefer a close-up view. Why can't I get a close-up zoom and get it to ""stay"" there? 
No Apple Car Play or Android functionality. I get it - Telsa likes their apps. But I like that extra functionality. "

tesla,model-3,2019,Some Guy, 02/21/2019,Surprisingly Phenomenal,5,"Moved from a BMW 5 series to a Tesla Model 3 AWD Long Range. The Tesla sneaks up on you. It's smooth and refined in all aspects - exterior design, interior comfort, and driving experience. Hard to believe they got it all so right, so quickly. There is definitely a learning curve to this vehicle. The controls and instruments are definitely out of the ordinary, but within a couple weeks, you realize they've thoroughly rethought the operator's experience from the ground up. The level of performance of all things is way beyond expectations. The acceleration is other worldly. That instant torque plasters a smile on people's faces - every time. Braking is excellent but the regenerative braking is aggressive and takes some seat time to get used to. The interior is comfortable and quiet. The noises you do hear are tires and such, but even that is on par with a comparable luxury brand. Removing the engine noise is wonderful. Front seat leg and head room are voluminous. At 6'4"", I am no where near the ceiling and with the seat all the way back, I'm no where near the pedals. Back seat has decent room, about equivalent to a C-Class Mercedes Benz. Head room in the back is excellent - far better than the Model S. Charging has been easy and painless. Took 2-3 months to completely get over range anxiety, but I don't think it will ever completely go away until there are faster charging alternatives in many more locations. That said, it's incredibly easy to figure out whether or not you have enough juice to make your trip - made even easier by the fact I can plug my car in at home. Charging overnight in my garage is far easier than any stop at a gas station. There are a couple things to improve, most notably the windshield wipers - they aren't intuitive at all and the auto function is very unreliable. The gutters over the doors and trunk can be improved, too. Original tires are obviously designed for low rolling resistance and longevity, not performance, but they do well to be quiet, hold the road, and make it through the rain. Not sure about others, but my vehicle was produced in November 2018 and it's initial fit and finish were fine - no issues. Had one minor service issue with a pinched cable for the heating system after about 2 months, but the service center got me in quickly, gave me a loaner, and had my car back to me within a few hours. Overall, it's the most fun and enjoyable car I've owned in my 25+ years of loving cars, with my Porsche being the one exception.

tesla,model-3,2019,Trey H., 04/28/2019,Best car I’ve ever owned (of 30+),5,"Before buying this car, know that you will never want to drive a gasoline car ever again, ever!  The acceleration is amazing, ride is smooth and quiet; handling is great and there are no more stops at the gas station.  All I do is take 1 second to press the open button on the screen for the charge port and 5 more seconds to plug in to my charger hanging in the wall in my garage.  Cost per mile is around .03 worth of electricity.  No oil changes, no transmission fluid changes, no spark plug or air filter changes; brake pads won’t need to be done but every 100k miles.  Charge and go and every once in a while fill up windshield washer fluid.  Though the car appears smallish, the interior space is gigantic for a car of its size.  A/C is strong and handles the Florida heat.  Seats are the most comfortable I’ve ever sat in and are a joy on a long ride.  Everyone asks, “Aren’t you worried about running out of charge?  Absolutely not!  The stock navigation system shows you where to stop at superchargers along the way and for how long you’ll need to charge and how much charge will remain when you arrive.  Superchargers charge at 400+ miles/ hour!

Update:  we have sold our Model 3.  Even though we loved it, my driving was not conducive to getting the 240 miles of rated range.  Keep in mind that the EPA range, much like EPA fuel economy, is achieved when driving under 60 mph.  I was getting about 160 miles per charge when I drove 80 mph on I-75 and the Florida Turnpike.  If you are familiar with these roads, you know that driving much slower than this is challenging with 18 wheelers driving at 70+ mph.  In the city, I used the ample acceleration frequently so was adversely affecting my range in the city as well; getting about 170 miles per full charge.  I am reserving a Model S long range!

tesla,model-3,2019,Joe P, 08/31/2019,Smile Inducing Transportation,5,"UPDATED REVIEW:

7 months of ownership in the books. Still love this car. It's the only car I've ever owned that I've still enjoyed the same amount as the day I brought it home. 

Other than my initial fit and finish issues which were all resolved, the only problem I've encountered is a ""flutter""/""rattle"" coming from the front passenger door above 50 MPH. Can't pinpoint where it's coming from but I will have it checked out during my next service appointment. (which probably will be at 10k miles for a tire rotation.) 

I've used the supercharger network to and from New Hampshire from Philadelphia. Really awesome experience with insanely quick charge times. All of the stations are around places to eat/shop/etc.

I can't seem to charge past 232-ish miles. I should be getting 240. Tesla says this is normal but it's been this way since day 1. 

About a month after I wrote my initial review my heated rear seats disappeared (like all other SR+ owners). This trim is not supposed to have them but it's crazy that the hardware is in the seats. As of a few weeks ago I can now re-activate them as an upgrade for $300!

A few months ago, Tesla also released the latest software updates which include Spotify integration, Netflix/Hulu and a bunch of other features like improved voice recognition. Really nice updates all around. As part of this I can now subscribe to ""premium connectivity"" for $10 a month. This allows me to stream music/movies from the above sources over LTE instead of wifi. It also enabled satellite maps and traffic visualization (so i can now see the traffic on the map.) I don't feel like all of this is worth $10 at the end of the day. But since there isn't carplay or android auto, having spotify integrated is a really big bonus. 

Bottom line- I recommend this car and encourage everyone to explore an EV vehicle for their next purchase. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Almost one month of ownership and its been a blast so far. Here's the current pro/con list. 

Pros:

-Acceleration is stupid fun
-Ride is firm but compliant 
-Handling is tight and athletic 
-Interior is simple but beautiful 
-Storage space is awesome. Frunk/Trunk/Center Console/Glovebox/Seat Pockets/Door Pockets. Way more than the other cars I've had. 
-Glass roof- Does not open however it is really enjoyable for passengers and doesn't let too much heat in
-Rear air events- great for the dogs
-Touch screen- takes some time to soak it all in but everything is easy and enjoyable to use.
-Navi- this trim doesn't have ""visual traffic"" but it still factors in traffic conditions for routing. You just can't see it. Weird but maybe that will change over time
-Bluetooth works well for music. I don't miss Carplay/Android auto since the navi is so good. 
-Audio- not the high grade system but very good sounding 
-Charging- Have not used supercharging network yet but it's been enjoyable finding free places to charge away from home and work.
-App- remote app for ""starting"", turning climate on, locating etc etc works awesome.
-Includes adapter for normal level 2 chargers as well as a cable to charge with a 120v outlet.  

Cons:

-Fit and Finish- I was surprised that there were so many fit and finish issues right off the bat given that this car has been out for a while. Upon delivery my front speaker grill was popped out, various door window seals had wrinkles in them and the trunk liner was slightly popped out. A remote tech came out and resolved all these issues which was a great experience but I was disappointed these were not caught before shipment. Also, a few days later i noticed a rubber tube sticking out of the frunk area. Turns out one of the wiper washer tubes was never connected. I slid it on but... come on Tesla!
-The Tesla app is great but my Pixel 2 doesn't work great as the ""key' to get in and start car. Usually cant sync with the
 car. Hoping Pixel 4 or new iPhone will be better. The access card they give you works fine as backup. 
-Steering wheel controls- two roller balls do everything. They work great for everything except for skipping songs/tuning which require you to push side to side.. My hands are average sized and i struggle to get a good grip.
- This trim isn't supposed to have heated rear seats but as of now it does. Concerned a software update will take these away :( ...first world problems 
-Ordering and pickup process was pretty easy, very friendly and definitely different than a normal car purchase. However, the online calculators and portal for applying for financing is a little inflexible/vague and I had to lean on my delivery specialist to fix things on the backend. There isn't much of a corporate customer service network at play. 

Other Notes:

Range is great but if you drive ""athletically"" (which is hard not to do) you are not getting the 240 miles of range. However, my commute is short, weekend trips are within 100 miles and i have EV charging at work so no range anxiety.

tesla,model-3,2019,Mr. Huang, 02/25/2019,California Model 3 owner,5,"The Model 3 is the first EV that I've owned and I have no regrets.  Mine is a 2019, so perhaps Tesla has worked out initial issues that occurred in the first year - the build quality is as good as my other cars (Hondas) and any minor cosmetic issues were fixed by the service center. The power and acceleration, even in the normal ""mid range"" model (not Performance) is great. Being able to charge up at night and have a ""full tank"" of electrons each day is also a plus. In terms of the user interface, if you can operate a smartphone, this is no different. The car's safety features and driving characteristics inspire confidence. However, owning an EV is not for everyone, especially one as advanced and different compared to gas cars like the Model 3.  So test drive one, and ask your friends, coworkers, and neighbors for their opinions before you take the dive.  They will likely enthusiastically endorse the car and offer to test drive theirs, like mine did!

Update: 12 months later and no regrets! Sold my Acura and still have the Honda, but thinking about replacing that as well.

tesla,model-3,2019,Dennis M, 02/25/2019,Best car I’ve Ever Owned!,5,"Smooth, quiet, powerful, comfortable, top notch sound system and navigation, great handling. Mine was delivered in October and had great assembly quality and zero defects. I thought the single screen would be a negative and difficult to learn. However, it is very intuitive and easy to use and learn. I came off of a BMW 330e plug in hybrid and this car handles significantly better and is more comfortable too. The touch controls on the Tesla are hugely better than BMW’s system as is the navigation.  The sound system in the Tesla is noticeably better than the Harmon Karmon upgrade in the BMW. I like the BMW styling better but the Tesla hass grown on me. The torque and silent drive of the Tesla will make me never go back to an internal combustion engine car again.

tesla,model-3,2019,Marcus Schoepke, 02/16/2019,Owner - 4 Months in,5,"Overall the Tesla Model 3 is the second best car I've ever driven, best being the Tesla Model S. The large touch screen might be weird at first, but after getting used to it (within a week or so) every other car having buttons and displays scattered all over the dash seems weird to me now. I wish people would actually sit down and calculate the cost to own the car they have. I drive around 12k miles a year and my electric bill is on average $43 higher so far, which results in $516 per year, $2580 in 5 years. The fuel cost alone on my BMW 740i was $2625 per year / $13,125 in 5 years. My Prius was $913 per year / $4565 in 5 years, but a way less fun car than the Tesla. Value depreciation should be better than the Model S since the EV tax credits for Tesla will be gone by end of 2019, and the used car market is very very small compared to any other top 10 car model.

95% plus has been home charging, when we did use ChargePoint or EVgo not a problem. What's even better - some are FREE.....as in FREE electricity. Go to the outlet mall free charging...movies....free charging....

The best car I ever driven. Plug it in at your garage, no trips to gas station, no oil changes, no hoses, no radiator, no spark plugs, no engine coils. No need to worry about those stuffs, that is how you look at it. Over time, it is win win situation compared to gas cars . Gets better as it gets older because of software updates. Highly recommended by me because of my experience with this car. This is the best car I’ve owned. Driving every day, had 30,000 miles, tire rotation is the only maintenance I’ve done.

"
tesla,model-3,2019,LadyAlf, 04/08/2019,Best car I have ever owned,5,"This car is by far HANDS DOWN, the best car I have ever owned.  First, before I get into detail, I have no idea why Edmunds gives it an 8 out of 10 for acceleration.  Either they have never driven it before, or are comparing it to the model X, cuz this thing is fast instantly. 

Let’s start with the very few cons that I have experienced. 

Issues: Front driver side window was having roll up issues (would roll up then back down half way).  I had to roll it up slowly in little “bursts” to get it to finally stay up. It also wouldn’t go down or back up when the door opened.  This was resolved with a replacement of the Window regulator and it’s working fine now.  I have also had two instances where I got into my car and had a black screen, and another time the screen was completely frozen.  However, I just pushed the two buttons on the steering wheel for about 10 seconds and then eventually the Tesla logo came on and everything was working.  

Preferences: The worst thing about this car is the windshield wipers.  There are 4 speeds, and they are never what I need.  Also, the automatic windows wiper option is way to slow for how hard it is raining, I usually just push the button on the end of the handle unless it is pouring.  I really wish there was a sunglasses holder/compartment at the top, and the visors are so small, they don’t do much. 

Now, let’s get into the good stuff.  This car is basically like driving a computer.  I don’t know of any other manufacturer that updates your vehicle regularly.  Additionally, once I’ve had my car for several years, I’ll still be getting updates that will have the features of the new vehicles, which is absolutely AMAZING! That’s one of the best things about it! Also, this car is FAST.  I have never had anyone beat me at a light unless I wasn’t trying. I’m not a speedy driver, but I LOVE that I have a car that is environmentally friendly AND a race car in one.  It can be driven for efficiency or performance, you chose! That’s phenomenal because with ICE’s, you basically get one or the other (efficiency or performance), but not both.  I typically get better than rated wh/mi (I average overall since I have had the vehicle 250, but I’m usually around 200 wh/mi), which I believe the 250 wh/mi is what the estimated mileage is based on, so I’m getting better than expected.  I never got better gas mileage with a vehicle then what was advertised, except maybe occasionally. The stock stereo (premium stereo) is amazing, I did add a subwoofer and amp to the lower trunk cargo area just for some extra base, but left everything else intact, and it sounds amazing.  If you are a TRUE audiophile, then nothing will be sufficient that you get stock in a vehicle, but for me and my needs, the quality is great.  The app is a wonderful addition, I literally just walk away from my car and hear it honk once I’m a certain distance away. I can check on it charging, and a super cool feature I learned when they were fixing my window is that the app will show which door or trunk is open at all times.  I could see them closing my doors or opening my trunk, it was super cool.  The easy entry mode is very convenient, it moves the steering wheel up and lifts my seat up when I put the car in park and remove my seatbelt. And the absolute BEST thing about this vehicle: I DON’T HAVE TO PAY FOR GAS ANYMORE! I couldn’t WAIT to get a clean air vehicle and not contribute to the oil companies (as much) anymore. 

Lastly, the buying process was a whole new experience, everything was done online, all paperwork emailed to you, even your receipts from service appointments are emailed and signed online, no paper wasted.  I simply ADORE my Tesla, and I can honestly say I will never purchase any vehicle besides a Tesla as long as they are available.  😊

Update: I have now had the car for over a year and a half, and I’m still as in love as the
 day I bought it. Best car I have ever owned, and I will still never own anything but a Tesla.

tesla,model-3,2019,E. Orkin, 05/03/2019,Almost a year: still looking for excuses to drive,5,"I haven't had this much fun in a car since I was 17.  The driver assistance is the best.  Over the air updates keeps the car current.  Many other pluses cited by others.  The downsides: not great for long hauls if you will mind stopping periodically for charging.  Too few Tesla Service Centers.  Poor availability of parts for repairs.  Nevertheless, I would not want to own any other car.

tesla,model-3,2019,Jeff, 03/21/2019,Driving a car from the future,5,"After one and half years of ownership, I still believe this is by far the most excellent vehicle I have ever driven.  There is no other vehicle on the market than can be compared to a Tesla.  The car is faster and handles better than my BMW 4 series and seems significantly more advanced.   Additionally, its the only electric vehicle that you can easily drive across the country because of Tesla's supercharger network along most major freeways and the car's internal system of navigation directing you on your route.  When on I-95, I always feel safer using the auto pilot.  Although this is not full self driving, I feel its a good partnership between my driving skills and the computers ability to see 360 degrees.  It really helps relieve stress when driving in congested traffic.  At first I wasn't sure how I would like all my controls on a large screen, but I quickly adjusted to this and now strongly prefer this well organized system.  This alone makes other vehicles seem antiquated. This is an excellent car and I highly recommend it!

tesla,model-3,2019,Mike Buehler, 04/04/2019,Just plain fun to drive,5,"I have driven BMW’s for 26 years.  Never had a car this responsive and fun to drive.  Feels tight on the road and extremely quiet.  Great sound system and outside noise suppression.  As spacious and comfortable as my old 540.

tesla,model-3,2019,EJNJ, 04/14/2019,Nearly perfect and effortless to drive,5,"I have had the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus RWD with the partial premium interior for over a year now and it is phenomenal overall.  Not a single thing wrong with it so far; in fact, it has received software upgrades over the air and has improved - without added cost!  For example, now I can use voice commands to control the car and I can adjust the windows remotely via the app.  Because the car does so many things automatically, it is effortless to drive.  Examples: the wipers, radio, side mirrors retraction, headlights & high beams, wake/sleep mode, the climate, the fuel door, and seat position (tied to the key card).  The most useful feature is its ability to brake and hold the car at a stop automatically.  Add to these features an uncluttered dash and I have never been so relaxed driving in my life.  By the way, it has a ton of storage and the seats are the most comfortable I have ever had.  I have driven or owned a lot of cars, including exotic sports cars, but I would not want to own any other going forward.  We want to buy another.  For about $40K, you get the most advanced, safest, most efficient, most convenient car in the world.  When I worked out the numbers of the cost of ownership, the savings in fuel and maintenance (plus incentives) over ten years make it comparable to ICE cars $10K less.  Bonus: It doesn't spew toxic fumes while you are driving it!  Trust me: Just buy one or trade in your current one for a new one; you will see!

tesla,model-3,2019,ColoradoRon, 04/17/2019,"Fast, head-turning, and fun to drive",5,"I love my Tesla Model 3!  It is more than I expected.  The acceleration is amazing.  The handling is crisp, responsive, and leaves you with a sense of being one with the road.  You merely need to think where you want the car to go and it seemingly is there instantly.  The interior is clean, sleek, and modern.  The comfort of the seats rivals any car I have ever driven.  The control screen is a bit cumbersome.  I actually wish a few more of the controls were on the dash instead of the screen, e.g., wipers and lights.  For a car of such obvious quality, the mats for the car are disappointing.  The center console should be upgraded to match the rest of the car.  There are OEM mats, center console wraps, screen protectors etc - but those should be part of the car.  However, I still love this car.  It is a joy to drive.  I am very happy with my purchase!

tesla,model-3,2019,DRM, 06/29/2019,Expectations exceeded,5,"The Tesla Model 3 LR AWD is my first EV.  I had planned on another brand originally, but went with the Model because it was half the price and a few other reasons.  My car was built 6/19.  I am very satisfied with the build quality.  The panel gaps are a bit inconsistent, but totally acceptable.  I have the white premium interior which also great.  Fit is not perfect, but also very acceptable.  Very happy I went with the white interior, especially in the summer.  The premium interior is very comfortable, seats are highly adjustable and supportive.  The quality of the sound system is excellent (immersive sound).  I'm really liking the Slacker streaming radio.  You can pick your favorite genres of songs.  The quality and variety of the music has been enjoyable.  No commercials or DJs.  I think you get a free year?  Bluetooth streaming with my iPhone works well, but I think you have to select the music from the phone, unfortunately.  I have the 18 inch aero wheels and I think they are great.  The ride is very smooth and quiet even at highway speeds.  There is a little wind and road noise, but not intrusive.  I'm listening to music anyway.  There are no rattles, which is critical in an EV..  The power of the LR AWD is incredible.  Mashing the accelerator is like an airplane taking off - pinned to the back of your seat, linear, smooth.  The steering is precise and nimble.  If you drive reasonably, it is very efficient.  On my commutes to work on mainly secondary roads I've been using 160s-170 Wh/mile (36 mile round trip).  A recent 160 mile highway trip, speed set 70-75 mph, used 230 wh/mile, a/c set to 73 deg.  Part of trip was stop/go traffic, outside temp 98 deg.  The a/c worked well.  The nav is great, shows traffic, speaks directions very clearly, and chooses the best routes.  My other nav systems have chosen some questionable routes.  The screen is very responsive and quick.  The interior is minimalist.  I'm getting used to it.   It's bright and airy.  In an EV I don't think you want too many lights, bells and whistles draining your electricity.  Charging is flawless.  I'm using a Juice Box Pro 40 with the J1772-Tesla adapter, level 2.  Just charged using a Chargepoint charger and it was simple and flawless.  I have 1000 miles of free supercharging to use.  Homelink works flawlessly to automatically open and close my garage door.  The Model 3 has made the transition to electric mobility an easy one.  I have yet to drive in cold temperatures, so I can't comment on the efficiency in those conditions.  These are my early impression"
tesla,model-3,2019,Rod, 07/08/2019,"Offer me any other car, I would not take it",5,"I have never loved a product let alone a car, like I love my Tesla Model 3 - in 10 months I’ve already logged 16k miles, I want to drive it anytime I can.  When I want speed, it has speed, when I want an easy drive, it has auto pilot, when I want safety, it’s the safest car on the road.

tesla,model-3,2019,Douglas Watt, 05/18/2019,"Paradigm-shifting, best sports sedan available?",5,"The take home message, after 24+ months of ownership: the Tesla Model 3 Performance Version is an affordable four-door electric Ferrari that gets the equivalent of at least 110+ miles per gallon (sometimes way better – at least around town).  It's a total game changer.  It combines amazing efficiency with great handling, performance, and space utilization and a decent ride too.  With one person on board, it will get you to 60 mph in just a tick over 3 seconds but with no wheelspin, and no engine noise.  Its braking and handling might be just as impressive, particularly in ‘Track Mode’, where, with proper tires, it's faster around the track than even a 2012 (earlier gen) Ferrari Italia 458.  It not only offers this BMW M3-beating performance with very little noise, drama or fuss, it might be the easiest car to drive you can buy, this being one of the least expected pluses. How’s all that possible???  A clean sheet design starting from scratch, and applying all the lessons Tesla learned with the previous Models S/X.

It will make your expensive BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Lexus, Alfa Romeo, or ANY otne her premium sports sedan feel primitive, unresponsive, and underperforming.  If you just bought one of these premium sports sedans, a test drive of the top Model 3 could literally make you sick with regret.  

While almost nobody buying a premium sports sedan looks closely at safety data, the Tesla Model 3 is clearly the safest car in the world, both from an active and passive safety standpoint.  It’s the first car to win outright every crash test category, showing a significantly lower risk of injury in a potential crash than any other vehicle.  If one equally weights performance, safety, and efficiency/ecology, it might be “the best sedan in the world.”  If these collective achievements were not enough, the car looks like the car Ferrari would have made, if it made electric four-door sedans – but of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  While clearly all technologies are about intrinsic trade-offs, the Model 3 strikes a stunning balance, in which very little is compromised, and much is optimized.  Neither my wife who is no car enthusiast nor I could ever go back to an ICE vehicle, regardless of how expensive or well made.  

These cars are simply a revelation to own and drive. If you haven't experienced one, you have no benchmark for them. Both M3s have been exceptionally reliable

PROS/BENEFITS:

1) As noted above, an amazing dynamic envelope of performance, handling, braking, with a pretty decent ride – a fantastic driver’s car, easily the equal of any sports sedan extant in overall dynamics.
2) Equally impressive energy efficiency and, with free supercharger use, potentially way lower cost of ownership/daily operating expense – even without free supercharging, much cheaper to own and operate.  
3) Unlike ICE vehicles, the slower you go and the more around town driving you do, the better your ‘gas’ mileage.  Driving conservatively around town, you can get under 200 whr/mi, which translates to over 165 MPGe.  Even on the highway, at current excessive highways speeds, we get greater than 100 MPGe (<330 whrs/mi).
4) Comfortable spacious feeling interior, with exceptionally good front seats, (a glass moonroof adds to the spacious feel), with a strong ‘minimalist’ theme.
5) Better space utilization than anything in its class, with two trunks, including a useful front one, a ‘frunk’?
6) Will charge fully overnight from any house current 240 volt line, and one of Tesla’s Supercharging stations can get you 100 miles of range in 10 minutes, 170 miles in 17 minutes, and 280 miles (90% charged) comes in 40 minutes from 10%.
7) Low cost of ownership and daily operation, due to our lifetime supercharging benefit, plus federal and state tax credits.  These might cut ~$15,000 off the sticker, such that a $70K sticker is more like $55K.  Its
 lower operating expenses and maintenance costs save ~ $15k over a 10 yr ownership period.
9) Significantly future-proofed via updates to core system software, with easy updates over Wi-Fi.  Right now it's the only car you can buy that is guaranteed to get better over time. At 1 yr, it's now a way better car than when new.
10) Very well integrated operating system run through touchscreen control.  Menus are compact, well-organized, easy-to-understand, and don’t have too much depth, but not everybody’s going to like running all the car’s systems from the touchscreen.  But after having some concerns about it, I've accommodated to it easily.
11) Best autopilot and cruise control available.  The navigation system is also IMO clearly the best in the industry.
12) Massive convenience of controlling, starting & locking/unlocking your car without interacting w/ keys/key fobs, via smartphone encrypted Bluetooth connection.

CONS:

1) Range anxiety
2) interior materials not commesurate with price of vehicle.
3) Elon's drama detracts from his, Tesla's and the car's, collective genius.

tesla,model-3,2019,Ben B., 04/29/2019,"Love my Tesla, just got another one",5,"I’m so happy with my first Tesla model 3 Long range AWD dual motor, my wife borrowed it and she never gave it back to me so I bought another one, SR plus. Just  got 17,000 miles on the first one, all l needed to do is rotate the tires so basically zero dollar on maintenance so far. Me and my wife drive 70 miles each day, total 140 miles per day 5 days a week. Our electric bill with 2 TESLA model 3 ‘ s is $12.50/car/week. The performance, cost of ownership, interior, exterior, range, maintenance, efficiency, reliability, the technology, you name it we love our Teslas so much. I’m saying what I’m saying because I’ve proven it. I told my kids already that they should by TESLA cars too when they graduate from college and they agreed. You can buy it online, no salesman. No stress. I will never go back to gas car. I never knew anything about TESLA 8 months ago until l realized I’m spending too much on gas and maintenance with my Honda Odyssey and Toyota Tacoma. Just gas alone, me and my wife used to spend $800 per month on gas, now just about $100 per month, with no oil changes, no tuneups, no radiators, no ignition coils, no smog checks, no transmission oil changes, no catalytic converters, no hoses. Man, that’s how you look at it. The savings, thousands of dollars.  If I stick to my Honda Odyssey and Toyota Tacoma, we would be still spending $9,600 on gas per year. Now with our 2 TESLAS, that’s only $1,200.  The only maintenance that you do with Tesla is tire rotation. Please use this review to make your decision to buy TESLA cars. You will never go wrong. Again, I’m saying what I’m saying because I own 2 Teslas.

I have the AWD long range battery and so far have not had any major issues. The self-driving is great and gets better with every update, and not having to fill up with gas or perform oil changes is a nice perk. There is a weird noise here and there but they dont last long and I cant remember ever being in a car where there wasnt a noise coming from somewhere, however the service is sub-par. It takes a while to get a hold of or hear back from Tesla, and my car did come with a scratch when it was home delivered.

tesla,model-3,2019,David in DC, 05/23/2019,9 months in and nothing but love for this car!,5,"I was one of the first to receive the Model 3 Performance, fully loaded.  Every day this car is a joy to drive.  Whenever I get into any other car, it's just a sigh.  The handling, acceleration, fit and finish and electronics are not like any other car I've ever driven.  The range of over 300 miles is more than enough for 95% of my driving and when I need to plan a trip that includes recharging, it' becomes just part of ownership and not an inconvenience.  T

It does take maybe a week to get totally accustomed to the center display that controls virtually everything on the car.  Once you become comfortable with it, you'll realize that this is how car controls should be laid out.  And as with your iPhone, this car is updated regularly which means that the car I have is the most up-to-date Tesla on the road.  Let that sink.  It's that spectacular.

If you're considering buying this car, go drive one and talk with someone who owns one.  You'll get honest feedback that will help  you to understand that your fears are based on the unknown, not on shortcomings of this car.

tesla,model-3,2019,J. D. S., 08/29/2019,It's a great vehicle!,5,"I took delivery of my Model 3 in March and after 5 months I don't think I could go back to a non electric vehicle. I think you need to be somewhat of a technical person to really embrace this vehicle but I think that is true for most new vehicles. The ride is excellent, the interior is a bit spartan but very comfortable. I am 6'3"" and 210 and could ride in it all day. I do have the premium interior and Full Self Driving and would recommend those options. The acceleration is awesome as is the Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It really is one foot driving and I use it all the time. Autopilot is great for major highways and interstate driving but useless around town IMHO.  
Overall I would highly recommend this vehicle!
Feb 29, 2020
I purchased a separate app in April of 2019 called 'Stats: For Tesla Model S/X/3' by MaaDoTaa that keeps track of many things and one is the cost of charging your vehicle. In 11 months it has only cost me $175  in electricity charges based on charging at home at $0.11 per Kwh that the JEA charges. That's pretty awesome!! I have had zero issues with my car and would continue to very highly recommend it!

tesla,model-3,2019,Steven Birnbaum, 03/25/2019,The future is here now!!!!!,5,"The Model 3 continues to be best car I have ever owned. It handles amazingly, has blazing acceleration and a comfortable well made interior. Have had no significant issues in 10 months of ownership with excellent fit and finish, the best electronics on the planet and great practicality. I have adjusted to the touch screen with time and it is no longer distracting at all. Apple play would be nice but available streaming in the car is fine. We installed a charger at home with a 240 volt line which cost $1000 installed. Costs me $50/ month in electricity charges, about 1/3 of previous gasoline costs with no other maintenance costs. Rotate tires every 6 months and change brake fluid every other year....that’s it. The Tesla supercharger network is excellent and fast and the navigation system will direct to the nearest chargers given your range and destination.  The future is truly here now!!!!

tesla,model-3,2019,Elephant, 06/06/2019,Driving a car is now enjoyable,4,"After owning a Tesla Model 3 for little over two months, I can say that it is now enjoyable to drive a car.  This car is super easy to drive.  Some of the features that make it so pleasant to drive is the instant torque and smooth acceleration.  Regenerative braking is the highlight every drive as I rarely have to take my foot off the accelerator pedal.  Beside these awesome driving functionalities - the car offers a luxurious interior.  The sound system is super.  We now have a moving karaoke system when our family is on a trip.  So far - our family loves every aspect of this car.  We are looking forward to discovering/using features that we we haven't used yet.

tesla,model-3,2019,New Tesla owner, 05/09/2019,Why buy non-Tesla EV?!,5,"Have had the model 3 for 3 weeks, very happy with it. It's such fun to drive this car, the acceleration, the handling, etc. The touch screen is VERY easy to get used to, there is NO distraction. With model 3 now at such a low price level compared to other EVs, with much longer range and better technology, I wonder why people buy other EVs?
"
tesla,model-3,2019,Shepard Sherwood, 07/27/2019,Amazing car. Years ahead of any ICE vehicle,5,"I’ve driven the Model 3 2600 miles. I’ve driven from Connecticut to Boston twice and Connecticut to Long Island once. I commute in the car 60 miles a day. The car is extremely quick. However the more aggressively you drive the vehicle, the less efficient it becomes. The auto steer feature is convenient as well as the adaptive cruise control. I did not purchase FSD. 
  
The seats at comfortable. Radio is fantastic. No SIRUS radio. You can use your phone. Safety features good, however, no audible alerts for lane assist. You only have a visual alert of cars in the blind spot. Kia has a better blind spot warning system. No autonomous rear braking. Jeep has a good system. Musk can fix the two deficiencies with software updates. 

Supercharging not bad will get quicker on road trips. You will save money on fuel. Drive responsibly and you won’t pay that much in electricity.
"
tesla,model-3,2019,Brian, 06/04/2019,Nothing Comparable,5,"Wow, just about perfect.  This is my second EV; I had a Nissan Leaf previously.  Like any electric car, the Model 3 has numerous advantages over a traditional ICE car - virtually no maintenance, quiet, instant torque, low operational costs, lower environmental impacts.  But Tesla also essentially eliminates range anxiety with their extensive Supercharger network.  And Tesla's styling definitely stands out from other EVs. 

The Model 3 is truly a reinvention of the car.  If an EV sedan will work for your lifestyle, and the Model 3 is within your budget, I don't see how you would purchase any other car.  It is that far ahead of any comparable vehicle.  True, it isn't perfect, but it's darn close.  My minor complaints: the wipers would work better with an adjustable stalk, there should be a smart key option, proper frunk closing shouldn't be so particular, a heads-up display would be great, a heated steering wheel would be even better (my Leaf had one, vastly improving winter driving).  The car had some minor fit and finish issues, but then I thoroughly checked it after reading some early cars had bigger problems.  Overall the quality is quite good.   

I have the Midrange version, unfortunately no longer available.  I always look forward to driving it.  It can be driven very efficiently (less than 200 wh/mi) or like a great sports sedan when desired.  Cargo room is very good and you can sleep flat in it unless you are rather tall.  The stereo is great, and I'm happy with the music apps (streaming stations and TuneIn).  The seats are incredibly comfortable and very adjustable.  Of course acceleration is great, even for a ""slower"" Tesla.  

There are many reasons why the Model 3 recently received the highest owner satisfaction title from Consumer Reports.  It is that good.  If there's a chance the Model 3 would work for you, just drive one and talk to some owners.  It may well be your next car.   
"
tesla,model-3,2019,David , 07/23/2019,"Great tech, fun, but mediocre fit and finish",4,"Will admit, I was reluctant at first. I was able to find a comparable gasoline powered premium car (albeit slightly used, which is my strategy for dodging the depreciation cliff that happens in year 1 - I owned two G80's that I absolutely loved) for less money.  But I was so tired of the cars I purchased becoming so obsolete so fast, so I begin really digging into research around Tesla.  What did it for me was the almost fanatic way owners bragged about their model 3s. I had never seen this before. Tons of Youtube videos and written reviews are dedicated to people who will tell you why they love their cars so much. Now after a two weeks of ownership, I can honestly say that I see why people are so fanatic.  This is by FAR the best buying decision I've ever made!! I absolutely love driving my model 3. I literally find myself figuring out reasons to go out just so I can drive it! It is a joy for so many reasons: 1. Tech will blow you away. You quickly realize after only a few hours of ownership how unnecessary buttons, dials, knobs and gauges really are.  The autonomy features are amazing. The car is incredibly smart. 2. Comfort. It is so quiet its almost eerie. 3. Updates - the over the air updates (coupled with lack of knobs and buttons) means unlike other cars, yours will never become obsolete. How many other cars can you purchase that become 20-30% better each year!! 4. Accessories - holy cow. there are a ton of things you can do to accessorize your vehicle after you purchase it, which I'll admit, has been fun.  5. Performance. I watched the Corvette C8 unveil yesterday, and how they were saying the base model will do 0-60 in about 5 sec. I can do it in my daily driver in 4.7! And let me tell you, when you're getting on the freeway and need to pass, no gas powered car can outrun you! its simply the fastest car I've ever driven - and I don't even have the performance model. I literally find myself laughing at all the Mercedes, BMWs and Audi's I pass.  Now some things I have to live with for all the benefits outlined above: 1. Springs are a bit stiff. I wish there was a comfort suspension mode for times when I don't want to be as connected to the road. 2. Wish there was a moonroof option 3. Apple Car Play would be nice only because it's what I was used to. 4. Range mileage can be misleading, so you need to pay attention. Best advice I received was buy the most range you can afford. I did and don't regret that. 5. Streaming service sometimes cuts out, so I end up relying more on my Apple Music from my phone.  All that said, I will more than likely never purchase a gasoline powered car again! This is by far the best and most fun car experience I've ever had!  Would highly recommend!

tesla,model-3,2019,Fred, 11/29/2019,Good drivetrain but multiple areas for improvement,3,"I've owned the Model 3 since April of 2019 and have had mixed feelings about the car.  While the economy and performance of the drivetrain are outstanding, there are multiple areas where the car falls short for me.

The audio system performance is very good; however, on demand music content and XM radio are not included as part of the audio user interface and are only accessible via your cell phone, so that means having your cell phone mounted somewhere or having it in your hand.  Honestly I haven't managed my audio content in that fashion since 2006.  Keep in mind how unreliable cell phone coverage is in congested areas or areas out of cell phone range, so plan to be frustrated.  Tesla does offer a very vanilla version of on demand audio, and a dumbed down version of Spotify, but think Pandora as opposed to Apple Car Play.  Kind of a back to the past experience.  Hands free and phone free XM Radio, Apple Car Play, etc. are pretty much standard with the user interface of even most mid range and lower price sedans.  If you're used to this you'll be frustrated with having to fool with your phone when you want access to this content.

The car does not offer true keyless entry via a real key fob but opts for either a very cumbersome key card, or a 1990's type manual key fob that requires locking and unlocking the car manually.  The Tesla phone app ostensibly serves that purpose via Bluetooth, but can often take up to ten seconds and multiple unsuccessful pulls on the door handle to open.  Obviously this is not very convenient in the cold, rain, or an emergency where you would need to enter the car quickly.  It's honestly the only car I can remember where the door didn't open on the first pull.  BTW the futuristic door handles are cool but are annoying when having to explain how to use for every new passenger.  This sounds insignificant but it becomes extremely annoying day after day.  How about a car of the future that actually opens when you pull on the handle the first time?

The auto wipers work intermittently (as in once and awhile) so you usually go back to manual mode when you need them.  Instead of the wiper control on the stalk, it appears on the screen requiring the driver to reach over as opposed to simply turning the stalk control. Also, you can count on your wipers scrapping your dry windshield the next morning if you forget to turn auto mode off.  Doesn't sound like a big deal until you need them, then it is very disconcerting.

If you live in a cold weather climate you will likely be disappointed in the climate control.  The heater works OK if you don't exceed 70 MPH or if you keep it at 80 degrees or higher.  In either case, for some reason, the car never actually heats up at temps below 30.  I have a service call in to Tesla on it that I placed on Nov 27th.  The earliest appointment is for January 2and (36 day wait!) telling me that either Tesla is under staffed or overburdened with service issues.  Sure would be a bummer if the car had a drive train issue, huh?

For some reason I always seem to have to engage the stalk at least twice in order to go into drive or reverse, but Tesla can't validate why and declined to fix that.  It does eventually work so I guess that's good enough for Tesla.

The rear trunk is actually pretty spacious but without a hatchback is a pain to use with large items.  Also there is no cargo net for groceries and loose items and no back window wiper in the event of rain or snow.

Good luck with a flat tire as there are no spare or run flat tires Included with the car. 

The drive train and suspension are exhilarating and the performance is nothing short of spectacular but don't expect a comfortable ride.  The car is very low to the ground and the ride, while very tight, is very harsh.  This is not luxury car ride experience.  It feels more like a sports car than a luxury cruiser.  Great if you
 like it, but it can be annoying on bumpy roads or snow and ice and honestly can wear on you day after day if you like a smoother ride.  Adjustable suspension would be a good improvement.

I've had several service calls since owning it and had to have the entire steering wheel assembly replaced as the directional signals didn't work correctly.  The auto high beams sometimes work and sometimes not.  A couple of months  after buying the car the headlights wouldn't shut off and required rebooting the car.  Every day is a new experience with the Model 3.  I'll admit, it keeps it interesting.

Finally, after almost eight months of ownership, I would give the car a B- at best.  Great drive train but too many issues.  Annoying would be the operant term for me.  If you're looking for a reliable and predictably good driving experience, I'm not sure this is the car for you.  On the other hand Elon and the team are to be commended for trying to change the world.  I would just advise them to pay attention to the details while they're doing that.

tesla,model-3,2019,Henry, 12/01/2019,Loved it and hated it,2,"When you spend $65,000 for a vehicle, you expect everything to work. This was not the case with my new model three. The Bluetooth connection would not work. My phone and all other Bluetooth devices could not connect. The tech people could not correct this, so they re-downloaded the software. This did not correct the problem, and in fact stopped the rearview camera from working. It also stopped the audible Blindspot monitoring alert to stop functioning. While going through all this, I found out that Tesla vehicles do not have automatic rear breaking, and do not have rear cross traffic alert which is standard on most vehicles at this price. While this car is wonderful to drive, it functions like a computer which can malfunction at any time. I simply did not trust it, and returned it within the seven day period.

tesla,model-3,2019,Marc, 07/15/2019,Revolution!,5,"Tesla made the first real new car since the T-Ford. Our cars from 2019 are basically the same as the car made in 1919 and Tesla made an end to this. Nothing is the same, not even details like entering the car, ventilation, charging, navigation, interface, autopilot, etc, etc. I've driven tons of cars (barrels and Maseratis, clunkers and Aston Martins) but the Model 3 is by far my best car. It's fast, road holding is amazing, the interior is stunning and it's relatively cheap. If you consider the (huge!) savings on gas and brake revisions (compared to other fast cars) the Model 3 will be very cost effective. The reason for this are the powerful electric motors that regenerate energy when you lift the accelerator. The car slows down rapidly so you literally almost never will have to use your brake pedal. Traveling thru Europe is very easy, the navigation system guides you to the closest Superchargers and tells you how much to charge and how long it will take. Tesla started a revolution, but lots of people still aren't convinced, is my experience. See if I care! But if you drive it once you'll never by a combustion engine again in your life. 
Update after 6 months: no problems whatsoever. Updates keep making the car better and faster.
Update after 12 months: All OK. Drove my old hybrid Lexus last week. Incredibly old-fashioned, compared to my Tesla. Home charging works fine. I only use superchargers on very long trips.

tesla,model-3,2019,shrimptrader, 12/06/2019,I'm tired of apologizing for buying a Tesla,5,"My friends and neighbors are always used to seeing me drive the latest and greatest German Import.  As a traveling salesman I will short term lease either a Mercedes or Audi.  Now that I'm thinking about retiring soon I wanted to buy a car that would last, less headaches and was cheaper to maintain and operate.  The Tesla Model 3 was the answer.  However now all my friends are thinking- 'well la-de-dah - look at you buying a Tesla now', thinking that again I'm upgrading.  I'm tired of apologizing or explaining my thought process to everyone. Little do they know that this car is $20,000 less than the last Audi A6 I had.  Not only is this car cheaper than the last cars I had, it is twice as better. I will never go back to driving an ICE car again.  I've always loved driving manual shift cars with sweet sounding exhaust.  And I thought I would miss the driving control experience with a Tesla - Wrong.  This car is a blast to drive!  It handles curves better than any sports car I've had.  Mastering 1 pedal driving is as bit as much fun as juggling 3 pedals for a manual shift.  The acceleration always puts a smile on my face. You feel like you are in a roller coaster.  The sensation of the loud rumbling v8 has been replace with quite whirr that winds and winds the faster you go.  I really feel like I'm driving the vehicle we should be driving in 2020.  I was actually considering buying a new Camaro so I rented one.  I flicked on the radio (yes cars still have them) and on came Lynard Skynard's Freebird, I was feeling pretty nostalgic - being in one of my favorite cars from the late 70's, listening to one of my favorite songs from high school, when I realized hey wait a minute nothing has really changed with this car or any other car in 40 years!
Only a Tesla owner can appreciate this next sentiment - every time a friend of mine buys a new BMW or Audi I will congratulate them aloud on buying such a cool car, but quietly I am saying to my myself 'you poor sap - those things are soo antiquated.

tesla,model-3,2019,MarvinM, 02/04/2020,Tesla Model 3 Mix review,2,"The car is extremely fast, very comfortable to drive and very safe.  The first issue was picking up the car.  I have to drive 200 miles to pickup the car through Los Angles traffic.  Once I got to the Tesla dealer, the pickup went very smooth and quick.  I was not happy with car on my way back home and wanted to return the car within the seven day return period but I would had too many miles once the car had been return.  After the car first wash, I have found two dents on the top rear trunk and Tesla did not want to fix.  After 2 weeks, through the Tesla app, I made an appointment for service in Rocklin, CA (which was 200 miles away).  I updated for additional service and the app change to a later appointment date.  I updated again for more service and the app change the date again.  The car has a very serious unwanted sudden acceleration problem which Tesla service said it is operating as intended.  Currently my main issue is very poor service.  You have to use the app to make an appointment.  You can call to schedule an appointment.  They text you for any updates.  This is the worst of any new car service.

tesla,model-3,2019,Smith, 06/07/2019,"Best gas or electric car, period.",5,"Somehow Edmunds gave the Nissan GT-r a 9.0 rating on acceleration. Why not? 0-60 in 3.2 seconds for a $100,000 track car is fast.  Tesla 3?  $65,000 car?  3.2 seconds with autonomous driving and 80 mpg-e and 5 star safety gets 8.5 rating? Biased journalists. 

Tesla needs no launch control or effort to match a GTR & the GRR is nearly double the cost.  Jealousy from the fossil fuel club?  Of course. Tesla Rules. Edmunds has some biased journalism.
After two years of ownership I’m still more in love with this car than ever? 

If you offered to trade me a new M3 or E-series or GTR with all options?  I’d say NO WAY!

tesla,model-3,2019,James Brotherton, 07/27/2019,Revolution car,5,"I’ve owned dozens of cars in my nearly 30 years of driving, everything from sedans to trucks and especially sports cars and muscle cars. The tesla model 3 has just blown me away in what it represents. A complete rethinking of the car basically. The performance, drivability, comfort, and efficiency are unbeatable. I’ve owned my long range rear drive for about 6 months and nearly 10k miles and have already done a few longer road trips (~1000 miles in a few days) and the supercharging infrastructure is also revolutionary. The mapping program suggests the best stops and times for the shortest drive for you. I actually enjoy the supercharger stops because they’re usually in decent areas, with coffee shops, or near funky downtowns, and give me an interesting opportunity to walk around a bit (munch better than walking around truck stops let me tell you!!). Anyway, if you’re in the market for anything in the 30,000 price range you need to do yourself a favor and consider the baby tesla. It’s as roomy or roomier as any large sedan (Camry/accord) and for a similar selling price, it’s like buying a Camry vs a spaceship. Seriously! Anyway, enjoy the ride, that’s what life is all about.

Everything about it is in another league. Like the iPod transformed music or the iPhone transformed the world from thinking their Blackberry was ""all that"", the Tesla Model 3 for me (And I've owned dozens of super luxury automobiles) is ushering that next evolution in transportation. If you have never driven it, then the car looks cool, and drives nice...has some cool tech, but you'll never understand the accolades. Drive this car and you will feel like your stepping into the future.

tesla,model-3,2019,TN, 01/04/2020,"Best electric on market, but a bit too hard core",4,"I've had my M3 for 7 months now. Even though it's spendy, it's good value for the range and performance you get compared to every other EV currently available. It feels solid and well built, though the seat material does seem lame for a car in this price range. Longer distances are a breeze with the Supercharger network. Tesla has done a fabulous job of designing the end-to-end experience - they've distilled it down to the basics - for example, you simply press the brake to turn the car on where the legacy carmakers make you push a redundant start button. It's by far the best driving car I've owned. This is a Very Sporty Car. That said, the amazing handling comes at the cost of a punishing ride and it is uncomfortably loud on most freeway surfaces. The headrests are hard and can't be adjusted - if you are a passenger and the driver has high-regen set, the back of your head will hurt from hitting the headrest every time the driver lets off the accelerator. We've set the car to default to standard regen, chill mode, and comfort steering - it makes for a much smoother ride for passengers. The back seat is not very comfortable - the seat seems flat and unsupportive. What I love the most is never going to the gas station - charging at home is the best thing ever. I love the massive trunk and the streaming media for music. Overall, I'm very happy with the car and I appreciate how forward looking this Tesla design is.  
"
tesla,model-3,2019,DRM, 06/29/2019,Expectations exceeded,5,"The Tesla Model 3 LR AWD is my first EV.  I had planned on another brand originally, but went with the Model because it was half the price and a few other reasons.  My car was built 6/19.  I am very satisfied with the build quality.  The panel gaps are a bit inconsistent, but totally acceptable.  I have the white premium interior which also great.  Fit is not perfect, but also very acceptable.  Very happy I went with the white interior, especially in the summer.  The premium interior is very comfortable, seats are highly adjustable and supportive.  The quality of the sound system is excellent (immersive sound).  I'm really liking the Slacker streaming radio.  You can pick your favorite genres of songs.  The quality and variety of the music has been enjoyable.  No commercials or DJs.  I think you get a free year?  Bluetooth streaming with my iPhone works well, but I think you have to select the music from the phone, unfortunately.  I have the 18 inch aero wheels and I think they are great.  The ride is very smooth and quiet even at highway speeds.  There is a little wind and road noise, but not intrusive.  I'm listening to music anyway.  There are no rattles, which is critical in an EV..  The power of the LR AWD is incredible.  Mashing the accelerator is like an airplane taking off - pinned to the back of your seat, linear, smooth.  The steering is precise and nimble.  If you drive reasonably, it is very efficient.  On my commutes to work on mainly secondary roads I've been using 160s-170 Wh/mile (36 mile round trip).  A recent 160 mile highway trip, speed set 70-75 mph, used 230 wh/mile, a/c set to 73 deg.  Part of trip was stop/go traffic, outside temp 98 deg.  The a/c worked well.  The nav is great, shows traffic, speaks directions very clearly, and chooses the best routes.  My other nav systems have chosen some questionable routes.  The screen is very responsive and quick.  The interior is minimalist.  I'm getting used to it.   It's bright and airy.  In an EV I don't think you want too many lights, bells and whistles draining your electricity.  Charging is flawless.  I'm using a Juice Box Pro 40 with the J1772-Tesla adapter, level 2.  Just charged using a Chargepoint charger and it was simple and flawless.  I have 1000 miles of free supercharging to use.  Homelink works flawlessly to automatically open and close my garage door.  The Model 3 has made the transition to electric mobility an easy one.  I have yet to drive in cold temperatures, so I can't comment on the efficiency in those conditions.  These are my early impression

tesla,model-3,2019,J in RedWood, 07/19/2019,2 weeks and 500 miles in,5,"A move cross country from NYC, where car ownership is insanity, led to the decision to purchase a vehicle. Careful review of cars led to the Model 3 for all the usual reasons, no emissions, safety, fun factor, good for families, very good storage space.
I had the car delivered by a Tesla expert from the factory, we spent 45 minutes going over settings and idiosyncrasies of the Model 3.
Overall:
FUN, this car is loads of fun to drive and easy to drive. The instantly available torque, excellent acceleration and feedback through the steering wheels makes the driver feel comfortable and confident when behind the wheel.
Two car seats fit easily and are quickly and securely anchored with plenty of leg room for our 7 and 4 year olds. 
Driver and front passenger comfort is very good, with plenty of controls to optimize comfort.
Getting used to the central display is a matter of a few hours of use and driving. By the end of the first week I had no concerns or issues navigating to key controls while driving (music, podcasts, AC) and glancing over at the speedometer while driving becomes second nature.
Cons
I have a 14-50 Nema plug in my home. The car came only with the 120v connector which takes 14 hours to add about 20% to the battery. I had to spend $35 and wait almost a week, as they were out of stock, to get a 14-50 connector. For a $58,000 car this feels like a mistake.
Unexpected behavior after a software update: I received an update to 2019.15.104.1 with a couple of days of receiving the car. After turning on “Lane Assistance” I experienced some odd behavior when I was driving on the highway and changing lanes. I had to switch the setting from “intervene” to “warn”. Not sure how to mitigate this type of thing. Perhaps a video with each update that walks the owner through the update and what to expect.

tesla,model-3,2019,BW, 10/07/2019,From an Audi A4 to a Tesla Model 3,5,"With my Audi lease ending I was all prepared to get a new 2020 Mercedes CLA 250.  Loved all the new tech and have been very happy with my wife's Mercedes GLC.  Then I went to lunch with a coworker who has a Model 3.  That started all of my personal research on what was involved with owning one.  I had no idea the range was so good or how easy and cheap it is to charge at home overnight.  But I had really no idea that electric cars were faster.  It just seems counter intuitive and I'm sure a lot of people assume that an electric car can't compete with a v6 or a turbo 4.  But in reality, I'd be spending WAY more for a gas car that gets my Tesla's 0-60 time of 4.4 seconds.  This car is super fast and because of the instant torque it just flies off the line.  The giant super clear screen is amazing.  I really thought I was going to miss some buttons, but Tesla thought out the layout of their interface really well.  Things like radio presets are actually easier and can include podcasts, etc.  Also after a few days of one pedal driving with regenerative breaking I could never go back to a traditional car.  This is so much less stressful in stop and go on the freeway, especially with autopilot.  The only thing I miss is Voice control of text messaging that I had with Android Auto but Tesla says that's coming. (I'm keeping my fingers crossed)

tesla,model-3,2019,Scott Ceccorulli, 11/22/2019,Amazing Car!,5,"I have had my car for a year and still amazing and fun to drive.  In fact, I make excuses to use the car and drive (I forgot to get ketchup at the grocery store!)  I have the performance model and the acceleration is amazing!  Feels like being in a roller coaster, my stomach still gets the same feeling even though I am controlling the speed.  Many looks from other cars when I punch it. Never gets old.  My last car was an Audi S6 with a V10 engine and I thought that was fast.  Not even close to this model.  Three best features about the car. 1) Software updates.  Feels like Christmas each time updates come through. 2) Keep climate on.  Although the car does not have cooling seats, you don't need them.  With this feature I never walk into a cold or hot car anymore.  You can turn this feature on from the car or the app on the phone.  One summer day the interior was 102, after turning on this feature from my phone, 5 minutes later the interior was 70.  3) Regenerative braking with hold feature.  I literally do not have to put my foot on the brake when driving.  The car will slow down quickly and actually stop the car with plenty of distance from the car in front of you.  Like others, it does have its drawbacks, the biggest complaint is the lack of Satellite radio even though their other models have this feature.  Blind spot detection could be better, maybe this will be corrected in a future software update.  I would recommend any Tesla to everyone.  Never going back to a gasoline engine.

18 Months Later:

Still the best car I have every owned and continues to get better with over the air updates.  I can't tell you how many times I have received the thumbs up from motorcycle drivers who think they can out accelerate cars at the stop light when it turns green (be careful of the police radar!).

Anyone who is on the fence with deciding whether to buy this car or not I have 3 words for you.

Performance is impressive no lag or hesitation. The information display is easy to navigate and has been trouble free. 

The car was a little pricey 55 and some change, but not overly so. Most of the driving we within 100 miles of home, so we could’ve gotten by with one of shorter range variants.

All in all I would have to say it’s solid car, and am well impressed. The buying experience was different than conventional purchase, and was completed online quickly. We received the car within 48hr of placing the order.

tesla,model-3,2019,Owner One-Year, 07/12/2019,Super fun and great value,5,"Definitely a great car for all the reasons reviewers have given. Also great value. 

On performance metrics, the AWD long range Model 3 out performs the Audi S4 and costs $10,000 less. As a mid-size premium AWD sedan, the purchase price is about same as an Audi A4. The total cost of ownership over 5 years is similar to a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord. Over 250,000 miles, total cost of ownership is less than any gas-engine car even one you got for free. Create spreadsheet or search for articles that go into math in detail.

Powertrain (battery/motors) warranty 8yrs/120,000 miles. Based on 7 years of Model S battery data, battery capacity should be 80%+ after 300,000 to 500,000 miles. Electric motors are designed to last 1 million miles.

UPDATE: 1.5 years and 45,000 miles later - still fantastic; DIY maintenance tire rotation, cabin filter ($24), and adding windshield wiper fluid.

tesla,model-3,2019,Eitan, 09/27/2019,"Tesla, the worst car manufacturer there is",1,"I'm sorry Tesla fans for this post but bear with me. I do not make a ton of money but I saved up for a few years to afford the monthly payments for a long range model 3 with self driving. Since I got the car around 2 months ago:

There are scratches, I didn't see at first, all over the car. I take some of the blame for not thoroughly inspecting the car but still.... there is a huge jagged, circular scratch almost as if someone tried to take a bite out of it. There are scratches on the top window. There were scratches on the front of the hood.

The seal on the door is broken. The wind noise is as loud as if the windows were down. The seals around 3 of the doors are twisted and ""bubbling"" up.

There is a massive blemish in the base paint. You can't see it unless it's in the right light but once it's visible it's horrendous. The service center workers in Tesla were taken aback when they saw it and said it would be fixed free of charge. The managers came back and said they wouldn't because their policy dictates they don't fix issues after 72 hours. I asked why I would have to pay for an issue caused by Tesla and they said it's their policy and they can't help me.

The foam in the roof was exposed and coming out. The service tech had to come and fix it.

The wood in the panel was misaligned and I had to take a razor and tuck it back in.

The trunk was misaligned and rain water was getting in. They had to come and move it, revealing the steel base underneath. I have to repaint.

One of the door handles is indented further than the others.

Tesla fixed a few of the issues however the expensive ones they refuse to fix even after admitting they were factory defects and totally their fault. I will have to find a way to pay literally thousands of dollars to fix Tesla's mistakes.

All of these issues have occurred in the span of 2 months. Buying a Tesla was one of the worst financial decisions I've made in 2019 and I'd like nothing more than to return the car. I used to think Tesla was one of the good guys but their severe lack of quality control, their terrible manufactured cars, and their willingness to allow their consumers to pay for their mistakes was an expensive lesson as to how terrible the company really is."
tesla,model-3,2019,Petros, 12/29/2019,Best car I've ever owned,5,"This is a computer on wheels. Extremely quick acceleration, relatively long range, nationwide access to superchargers (that have always gotten me back on the road for at least another 250 miles after a 25 minute charge).  It's very quiet, which allows me to take advantage of the excellent sound system.  Lots of bells and whistles.

Although lots of gadgets and features are built in, the controls are intuitive. 

Best of all, every time there's a software update, I get new features to play with. It's sort of like getting a new car every few weeks.

The safest car out there. No keys, can set inside temperature from the app while car is in the garage. No oil stains in garage. Security systems that records video if somebody approaches the car. Autopilot greatly reduces stress especially in traffic, still need to pay attention,  but it's getting better.

tesla,model-3,2019,Nick, 11/15/2019,"Great all around car, wonderful for the family",5,"We got this car having never test driven a Tesla as we are environmentally conscious and have solar panels on our house and were looking to go electric.  In my opinion it is the only electric car that you can truly road trip with given the 300+ mile range and supercharger network that is unmatched by other auto companies at this time.  Hopefully that changes.  Considered a plug-in hybrid but this does have the added advantage of lower maintenance and hopefully longevity.  We have always driven Accords/Camrys, so this is definitely an upgrade.  It is wonderful getting 130 miles to the gallon equivalent, and love the fact that the crash testing results are so high (plus the accident avoidance even though we didn't purchase Autopilot).  Didn't expect so many people to ask me about my car but it's nice explaining all the advantages of an electric car to them as most people are really worried about charging issues which I have found to be minimal with this car.  I have only supercharged once on a long road trip; otherwise just use a dryer plug at a relatives house or hotel overnight.  We have 9,000 miles on the car in 6 months.  The driving experience is great and the tech is a nice touch, but these reasons were at the bottom of our list when it came to a purchase decision.  I think the Edmunds review about the touchscreen is a bit overblown.  After 2 weeks of driving the car, you basically have all your settings saved; Spotify is now available as well.  You get used to 1 pedal driving pretty quickly as well and the last update to come will now regenerate the car to a stopping position.  I hope the purchase cost continues to come down for electric cars as it seems this is the main downside (long-term cost of ownership is more appealing though).

tesla,model-3,2019,Emre, 12/03/2019,There are EVs and there is Tesla,5,"Sure all EVs share the same benefits over ICE cars, instant torque, no gear changes, one pedal driving etc but the Model 3 is the only relatively affordable EV that would still be a great car if it had a combustion engine. Nice chunky (BMW M-esque) steering wheel that is very precise, nicely weighted, and has a quick ratio. Overall the car feels very tight and handling is very secure. F/R weight distribution and center of gravity are both incredible. Simply put the balance of this car is second to none. Excellent visibility. Interior material quality is easily on par with German and Japanese premium brands. I have an October 2019 built car and the build quality is very good' cabin is significantly quieter than earlier cars and no fit/alignment issues. Amazing infotainment system with best in-car navigation system at any price point. Seats are supremely comfortable though takes a few weeks to truly break them in. Interior space is equal to BMW 5 Series despite exterior dimensions similar to the 3 Series. I can fit a rear facing car seat behind me at the driver's seat at 6 feet.

As for the EV related bits, range anxiety does not exist. I have a 60 mile commute and even in the worst weather conditions I am using roughly 20% of my battery capacity. Acceleration is ridiculous especially at the mile-high altitude. My fuel/energy cost has cut down to 1/5th despite coming from a 40 mpg car. Regenerative breaking calibration is superb. 

EVs are the future but Tesla is the future of EVs and it is available today. I am a car guy who owned many premium and sports cars (still own a Lexus RX450h) and Model 3 ruined me for other cars. I honestly do not think I can go back to a non-EV and currently there is no EV I would have over the Model 3 (including the aging Model S). 

One con (other than making every other car feel dated) that bugs me everyday is the lack of heated steering wheel. Such a simple thing but a huge omission in a premium car. Still the best car I have ever owned...

tesla,model-3,2019,Capn 22, 12/11/2019,Best EV for road trips,5,"Who should buy a Model 3 Performance:  Someone who wants to spend about $60,000 and blow just about everything off the road that costs up to twice as much.  The 20"" wheels are dope, but prone to pothole damage.  Probably best to change the wheels if you live in Pennsylvania.

Who should buy a LR Model 3:  Sedan seeker with a budget around $40,000 for an ICE.  You'll come out ahead, total cost of ownership with the 3, if you drive the average number miles or more per year.  Road trips are easiest with the LR 3. Fastest supercharging. 

Who should but a SR+ Model 3:  Someone who wants a sedan but does not intend to do road trips greater than 500 miles often, and is planning on spending about $30,000 on a ICE sedan.  Assuming you drive around 13,000 miles a year, you'll come out ahead on cost of ownership.

Who should buy the standard $35,000 Model 3:  Nobody.  The SR+ is a much better value.

Why Tesla?  Because it is not really a car.  It is something to maximize joy.  Everything else is just....transportation.  If you can afford the FSD option, get it.

tesla,model-3,2019,HonestAbe, 12/12/2019,Whole New Ball Game,5,"Sorry all you lovable curmudgeons at Edmunds but, despite your silly nitpicking, you know you loved driving this car. It's comfortable, stable, insanely fast and fun, and way ahead of the competition in technology. Still, it's kind of cute that you rated tech a 7 because it doesn't have the Apple or Android things. My wife gives technology about 30 minutes before she goes looking for a hammer to smash it and she took to the Tesla interface in about 10 minutes - that's how good it is. And with each effortless software update it just keeps getting better. And, really, the screen is a driver distraction? And the 20 or more buttons or knobs on a traditional vehicle aren't? You know this is an entirely new breed that blows away every ICE competitor anywhere close to the same price but you just can't bring yourself to say so. Someday you should post your requirements for the car that's gets your precious 10 rating. In the meantime, I will enjoy my Tesla WAY more than what you are driving. "
tesla,model-3,2019,Thisisthebestcar, 12/12/2019,Single best purchase I have made,5,"I have owned multiple German sedans and must say that the Model 3 is by far the most enjoyable driving experience. Even in the lowest spec trim it has enough acceleration to scare the bejeezus out of unsuspecting passengers when mashing the accelerator while the low center of gravity and tightly tuned suspension make it pure bliss to drive on curvey highways. The supercharger network makes long road trips a breeze with no need to fumble around with credit cards, as all is billed directly and instantly through your Tesla account. Waking up to a full charge every morning means no more trips to the smelly corner gas station for the weekly commute. I can't comprehend why Edmunds gives the model 3 a 7/10 on technology, when Tesla regularly beams new updates to the car adding features such as Spotify, Netflix and YouTube while also increasing performance by 5% and boosting charging speed with over the air updates. Name one other non Tesla car that has this? Plus I love the central touch screen! After some use muscle memory is able to find the quick access features that you would regularly use or adjust while driving. Anyone sceptical of this vehicle should book a test drive! It will introduce you to the future and you won't be able to go back to driving anything else without thinking that you are using outdated technology - see iPhone v. flip phone.

tesla,model-3,2019,Electric Buzz, 01/29/2020,The future is now,5,"In the past 10 Years I have owned an Audi S6, an Audi S5 and a BMW three series. We also have had a Mercedes GLS SUV.  These all were beautiful machines that were a pleasure to have a drive.  The Tesla blows them all away. First it is an incredible automobile to drive with it’s immediate throttle response and incredible acceleration.   Second it’s simple user interface is clean and highly functional and easy to use. The German cars are simply over engineered complex and expensive to maintain.   I used to be one of those guys that wanted a straight six and shift my own gears and I still think that’s fun. However now it’s about amazing battery technology, over the air updates and knowing that you are using a technology that’s better for our earth.  Oh, and it’s the first American car I’ve ever owned.  
There are a few things that I would recommend be improved. First, I miss the heated steering wheel I had in my other cars. Second, because the drive train is so quiet road noise is more apparent and any efforts to quiet the car further would be very much appreciated.   My other cars also had air suspension that was adjustable and I found that very comfortable and I know that’s available on the model S but it would make the model three even more comfortable.  The interior in the model three is high-quality plastic materials and I love the white interior but the German cars definitely feel more luxurious with the supple leather and chrome and wood. Some might call that a little old-school but it is quite cozy that way.   As beautifully crafted as the European cars are they end up having massive depreciation, and people don’t want to hold onto them too long because they are so expensive to maintain outside of warranty and so they end up becoming disposable in 4 to 6 years, something that’s probably not also good for the environment.
Bottom line is, I am a car enthusiast and I bought this car because it is enthusiastically fun to drive and comfortable to use every day. The energy efficiency is just a bonus.
I ended up not getting the full self driving mode but just the basic auto pilot which I find very nice. My observation is that the full self driving is really not ready for bad weather situations like snow or rain and when I drive by construction zones it can get confused.  However the basic auto pilot works much better than it did in my Audis.
Those of you doubters should just be patriots that American ingenuity is once again producing a breakthrough product.  Made in the USA and loved across the world.   Hope you enjoy the SUV and trucks that will be coming soon also.

tesla,model-3,2019,Kim, 04/03/2019,"Great car in the front, not in the back!",4,"We have only had this car a few months. And we have loved most features. The big screen is wonderful and the lack of maintenance is amazing. However...the door handles try to look cool but are difficult. Do not take a road trip in the backseat. There is no leg room. The worst was when I was behind the driver seat with my legs under the seat before the driver got in. The seat automatically puts itself into position and then presses down. So it crushed my feet not allowing ample time for the driver to know how to reverse it if possible. The seat continues to push down.
Self driving is too jerky for busy roads but is awesome for highways with less traffic.

tesla,model-3,2019,Andrew, 06/15/2019,Lower cost of ownership,5,"Yes, the MSRP is slightly higher than other traditional sedans, but with no/little maintenance costs, and low energy costs, it is a great value over the life of ownership.  After owning my Model 3 for a full year, I would never go back to a gas-powered vehicle.  My initial concerns over running out of battery charge never materialized. It takes 5 seconds to plug in my garage after my daily commute....better than having to pull into a gas station every week.  I take it on road trips too and charge after 4-5 hours of driving...which means it’s time to have lunch or dinner anyway.  Autopilot makes driving on the interstate much less stressful. However, when on the open road I prefer to take control since the handling and instant torque make this car so fun to drive.  I loved Audi prior to owning my Tesla, but this car is so far better.  My younger family of 4 use our Tesla comfortably and leave our Highlander behind...but the back seats will eventually be a little cramped when kids reach teen years.

A very underrated aspect to the car is we have a toddler who sits rear facing. With the glass roof she can see everything and points out clouds, stars, planes and the moon. She loves the Tesla so much. After having a Tesla it’s like going from a flip phone to an iPhone where you just wonder why haven’t all cars been like this.

The car shows its value in three ways: 1) you can't find a ICE car with 0-60 at 4.4 seconds below 50k. 2) with the federal and state incentive, plus the saving on gas (many free charge stations around, only paid $10 so far while on a trip to NYC), I estimate the final cost will be just slightly above 30k. 3) The auto pilot is a big help after 10 hours at work, and has been performed flawlessly (after a service call though)

tesla,model-3,2019,CMR, 06/29/2020,No support,1,"I just picked up my Model 3. I had to drive almost 3 hours to get it.  There was no delivery to my area. When I arrived, I was surprised that there was no help, no welcome and no support. I was on my own to figure out where the car was, how to get into it, configure it and of course drive it.  While Tesla sent a series of basic videos prior, I had no idea that I would be completely on my own. The 7 videos offered no detail on the things you need to actually drive 3 hours.  Basic things made this really frustrating such as: how do I change the upside down map, change the jerking absolute stop when not accelerating , how can I get sound working on calls going out and coming in, and how do I know if the partial charge on the car will get me home?!  The charge percentage has little meaning to me.  I've a 160 mile journey to make and my worst nightmares in considering this car might come true.  One by one, I Googled each challenge as best I could before the trip and made calls to family members while navigating back home.  I found my way to a supercharger but had no idea if I pay, how I enter or how long I'd wait.  It was getting dark by now, but after figuring out I needed to back into the site and got over the fear of what the heck am I to do, the recharge was super fast.  At home, I learned the car does not auto lock even though I set this configuration twice.  I also learned that my $51k car doesn't come with a garage door opener!  Crazy.  After a lot of research I see I can buy this for $300 and take it back 3 hours to have it installed! What?!  Customer service calls required a 20 minute wait to get to a really rude guy who insisted I knew I needed to purchase ""homelink"" and that it was available to add when I bought the car.  Nope, it wasn't, but thanks for the attitude.  So, so far I haven't actually enjoyed this car as the experience has been so awful so far...  "

If you are in autopilot and road has potholes, it will find the same pothole everyday.  Since it is auto pilot, 99% tire will go on same spot every day. 4. No detection of a car slightly in your lane.  It just goes blindly.  I do not know what will happen if a car is close by since I take out from autopilot before accident could occur.  I was living with all the issues fine but when I called customer service, I found I made a big mistake buying this car.

tesla,model-3,2019,Debbie K, 03/14/2020,AVOID A TELSA FOR SAFETY SAKE,1,"I returned this car when I realized just how dangerous the car is. 

The bright large screen requires you to constantly take your eyes away from the road. This includes basic items like windshield wipers in the rain, answering a phone call or changing the car status to a type of traction control in a critical situation.   At night, even at lower levels of brightness, you eyes can not adjust quickly enough to see the road properly.  The screen blinds you for long enough to hit something or someone. Fighting a screen in order to see out the front window is an unacceptable danger. 

Even if you can see the screen, frequently the controls to the necessary areas are covered up by pop-up screen displaying some other issue. 

Operationally, the windows have to slightly open in order for the door to be available. Windows don't work, you will not be able to get out the car. I hope this never happens to anyone in a accident, where the windows no longer are accessible, yet the passengers have to leave quickly.

Even in day to day adjustments, the layout and interactive function is not intuitive. My husband got trapped in the car, because he could not figure out how to open the door. Basics should be a norm not an exception. 

The car offers Karaoke, but not a basic such as AM radio or even the option of satellite, relaying heavily on WiFi for all features When you run low on battery, the car turns off features to conserve power. 

Driving, I found the acceleration rate caps out when above 50 miles per hour. Yes it takes off quickly, from a dead start, but when you need speed at the upper levels, the car loses the same jump.

Charging is a 8 hour adventure, if available.

Purchasing there is little opportunity to customize the car to your liking. 

Finally, the customer service is all about them telling YOU what YOU need.  Nor do they want customer feed back. I heard repeatedly customers wanting to return the car for good, because appointments are put off again and again. The company has a lot to learn from the big boys in customer service and design. 

In all honestly, this car is nothing more than a glorified golf cart. It is not ready for prime time. 

I wanted it to work. It was a good theory, but the company needs an education before they attempt diction. onto others.

Look at a BMW instead. Charging is faster and the interface is understandable and reliable. Price is in the same area.
"
tesla,model-3,2019,Shadow, 05/24/2019,Great car that's a lot of fun,5,"The model 3 is totally different then any vehicle I've ever drive. The user interface (controls) take a couple of days to get comfortable with, but once you get comfortable you will never want to got back to a more conventional vehicle.
The seats are the most comfortable I've ever experienced.  I experience less stiffness during a long road trip then other luxury cars I've owned. The only recommendation I have is to offer vented/cooled seats.  The performance can't be explained and has to be experienced.  Make sure your passengers aren't looking down at their phones when you hit the accelerator hard or you might give them a sore neck (happened to my wife when I first took her for a drive).
Electric car specific info:
- Charging at home is simple and inexpensive. I had 240v outlet added to my garage (cost $200 but depends on where your panel is...).  My home charging cost about $6-$8 for 300 miles depending on seasonal utility rates.  Charging on the road is fast and easy but costs around $15-$20 for a change (still less than gas). I usually charge for about 20-30 minutes and gain about 200 miles (enough time to get a quick but to eat). I've put 15000 miles on the car in 7 months so chatting hasn't held me back.  The lack of routine maintenance is refreshing, no oil changes..., just rotate tires and fill washer fluid so far. The reliability has greatly improved now that Tesla gone thru some learning pains.
UPDATE: I've had the car for 20 months and 37,000 miles.  I still love the car and haven't had any issues.  Long road trips do take a bit more planning and my typical 13 hour trip takes about 14 hours (an extra hour because of charging).

tesla,model-3,2019,YossRoss, 03/21/2020,"It's not a car, It's a spaceship on wheels.",5,"The near perfect 50/50 weight distribution is something the best of Ferraris have a hard time achieving, combined with the fact that the center of gravity is literally under the floor, lower than in any other vehicle, means the weight goes unnoticed and the overall feeling is of constant control and immense power which gives it very good cornering and makes it a true delight to drive.
Paired with the fact that electric vehicles receive %100 torque immediately means that no matter what or when, your power return is immense and immediate, bolting you off the line, or into the next lane.
The vehicle itself is comfortable, well built and clean, anytime I get back into a regular vehicle, I look at the 5000 different knobs, valves and controls with confusion and disgust. Why is all that clutter and mess even needed, why not have the clean elegance of the Model 3?
Unlike any other vehicle on the planet (aside from Tesla's range), this one gets software updates so this vehicle actually improves over time instead of just aging. which is a paradigm shift for the vehicle industry as a whole. This means you're constantly getting new games new features, bug fixes and actual improvements, such as increased range and speed boosts. And of course regular improvements to Autopilot and FSD.
Autopilot and FSD is a must and a true lifesaver in more than one occasion, it makes driving the car so much easier safer and fun, and alone makes Tesla vehicles the only smart vehicle to purchase. In addition the Model 3 is also the safest vehicle ever tested by NHTSA IIHS, and EuroNCAP.
The fact that it may be able to operate as a robotaxi in the future and make money for you while not being used, is just the bonus on top!
When you factor in the total cost of ownership of the vehicle, this ends up  drastically cheaper than any comparable compact luxury sedan, and if you do a lot of driving, it even ends up cheaper then a used Honda Civic.

tesla,model-3,2019,ChristianG, 04/02/2020,2019 Model 3 AWD,5,"I bought my model 3 in April of 2019.  I went for a test drive on a Saturday (loved the car), applied online for financing on Sunday (and was approved within minutes) and picked the car up on Monday!  Best car buying experience ever!  Luckily they had inventory at the time.

I have now owned my model 3 for almost 1 year and have 20,500 miles on the odometer. I can say without a doubt this is the best car I have ever owned!

Until you have owned one you really can't understand why they are so great!  You can't understand what it means to not have to go to the gas stations twice a week (in my case).  You can't understand what it's like to not have to go get the oil changed every 3-4 months.  You can't understand what it's like to not have to check any fluids (other than the windshield washer fluid).  You can't understand what it's like to have a fully charged vehicle waiting for you every morning with a preconditioned cabin (warm or cool).  You can't understand....I could go on and on but the point is....You just can't understand until you've owned one.

People have to stop comparing these cars to ICE vehicles because there is no comparison.  This car is fast, smooth, quiet and very comfortable.  Yes, there are ICE vehicles that are those things as well but they don't do them in the same way.  The minimalist design may not be for everyone which I understand. I personally like the design but it's not for everyone.  Having a single 15 inch screen for everything is fantastic.  Not having any dash lights right in front of your eyes when driving at night helps with being able to see.  I love getting over the air updates which continually improve the vehicle.  No more having to go to the dealer to have them install an update on the car.  My car's range and 0-60 time have both increased since I bought the car.  I can watch Netflix or Hulu while I wait for the kids to get out of school or while I wait for them to get done with practice.  The navigation is one of the best I have ever used.  You put in your destination on your phone and then you can share it with your Tesla.   I have taken this car on an 1,100 mile round trip using superchargers the whole way and it performed flawlessly!  The navigation tells you when you need to stop, how long you can expect to be there and how much charge you should have when you are done.  Every stop I was the only one charging and by the time my family and I were done in the gas station the car was ready to go (I guess I have been to a gas stations since I bought the car). It took no longer than stopping to fill the gas tank and use the restroom when traveling with an ICE vehicle. 

The one issue I had with the vehicle was a squeak coming from the front driver side wheel.  I had a mobile tech come out and take a look at it.  He removed wheel and dust cover to see if there was a rock lodge between the rotor and dust cover.  There was not.  He couldn't find the cause of the squeak.  I had to take the care to the service center where they determined the rotor had a small abnormality that was causing it to rub.  They ended up replacing both front rotors and all brake pads which fixed the problem.  Besides new tires at 14,500 miles (I was hard on the first set of tires) I have had to do nothing to maintain the car.

I would recommend that if you are in the market for a new vehicle and this is in your price range that you take the time to schedule a test drive.  They say the test drive is Tesla's secret weapon and I have to agree with them!  After all, I had my car 2 days after the test drive!

Safe driving!"
tesla,model-3,2019,Sidey, 01/08/2020,A Stealth...,5,"On the Tesla website, you'll find 3 trims... SR+ (260 range, 5.6s), LR AWD (320 range, 4.4s), and Performance (310 range, 3.2s). Whats not on the menu, a 'Stealth' or 'Sleeper' , which is a Performance without the appearance package (spoiler, 20"" rims, red calipers, lowered). This is also only 2k more than the LR AWD but 5k LESS than the full Performance but still gives you 0-60 in 3.2 (3s now after a recent OTA update!). These are built in small batches and you need to ask about them to secure one.. they are hard to find but worth looking for. 
This should not be confused by the new 'upgrade' option of 'acceleration boost' (also $2k) that LR AWD owners can buy... it is still not as quick as a Performance or Stealth...  
Cost of running ... even as heavy footed (and it's winter so i'm using a lot of heat and seat heaters), i'm running about the equivalent of HALF the cost per mile as a MB C300 or BMW 3 series... and thats not even factoring in oil changes (not required) and ongoing maintenance! 
And the quickness of these cars is staggering... everyone that's ridden in my Stealth states that it's like being on a roller coaster, when it's punched. 
Ease of use for the car is incredible, no key, no start, voice commands (latest update) to control almost all functions of the car (set temp/AC/seat heaters/media/telephony etc) makes it even easier now to simply enjoy the drive. Most seamless car and driver experience ever... 
All Model 3's now come standard with AutoPilot and Full Self Driving is available as an optional upgrade.. 
If you go to test drive one, be prepared to place your order :)

tesla,model-3,2019,HansM3, 03/03/2020,6 months and still amazing !,5,"Update 9/2020@12k miles: It’s been a year with the M3 and it’s been great. Zero problems and the car has gotten SO much better via Monthly updates. It now recognizes and reacts to stop signs and traffic lights, Self-driving has improved vastly and little annoyances like the auto-wipers have been fixed. New conveniences like auto-close Windows, sentry mode viewer, side-view addition to backup camera and so many more little things make the car better. It is so exciting to see what’s in the update when you get the software update notification!  Can’t recommend highly enough. Now that Model Y is available, may want to consider that since SUV-like and true hatchback if you need it. 

While not perfect, my Stealth AWD is the best commuter car I have ever owned.  I have owned many cars from econoboxes to luxury sedans to deal with my long commute.  For comparison, my last car was an Audi A4 which I drove 166k miles and really liked (and still have).  When looking to replace it, I really wanted to get a new or lightly-used 2018+ A4.  While doing so, I drove the Model 3 and that was it.  Here's my comparison of the 2 cars:
Build Quality:  Audi a bit tighter and substantial, really nice, high-quality fit, finish, materials
Driving: Audi suspension a bit better, but acceleration, cruise and regen braking is much better in Tesla.  0-60 around 3 seconds vs double in Audi.  Auto-Pilot great in slow traffic.
Economy:  About $40/month in electricity vs. $200 for Premium gas.  No maintenance so far.  Note that range drops significantly in winter for battery conditioning and heat.
Sound system:  Very Good in Audi, amazing in M3.  Do miss AM/XM radio sometimes and miss CarPlay,
Other:  Occasionally miss the sunroof in Audi vs. all-glass roof in Tesla.  Better than opening windows.  Annoyed that HomeLink option was removed from Tesla and could not have installed at delivery and had to make extra service trip since it required hardware install which was difficult to schedule (3 week wait I think).  Audi interior is more luxurious overall, but I like Tesla minimalist vs. say the Audi A3.  The A4 is much nicer space but I prefer the Tesla seats (Audi was not sport seat).
So, in general, really like Tesla over Audi and am happy with my choice.  Few additional positives to mention: App remote heat/cool, constant updates making things better or fixing issues like wipers.  Save FSD money, TACC + AutoPilot will stay in lane and follow any car while Enhanced Summon a gimmick at best so far.  Save the $7k and you can always add later.  A few quirks to mention:  door handles and button inside needlessly annoying, especially when cold/frozen.  Wrap the console ASAP as it scratches easily.  Car wash mode would be nice since car likes to put itself into Park if no driver detected in seat.
Recommended configuration:  AWD with or without additional speed option for extra $2k (can also be added after purchase from app). This gives you the 18"" wheels which are better on NJ highways and better range plus aero covers which do add about 10% range, even though I removed them and got the $50 lug/center cap set. The stealth speed option vs. Performance trim also omits stiffer/lower suspension, spoiler, upgraded brakes.
Be aware that there is a learning curve and if you're afraid of technology or don't like this idea of few knobs/buttons, this is not the car for you. It's more like your smart phone and changes with updates.  Give the center screen a week and you'll be used to it.  The open view ahead is worth it.
 If you have a place to charge at your home or work, doing so is so convenient and I would take the Tesla as the commuter's choice.  Hope this helps if you're still deciding : )

tesla,model-3,2019,rongreg13, 04/21/2020,Exceeded my expectations across the board,5,"Initially, I was concerned that the single central display screen would be difficult to get used to and distracting, but it has turned out to be the exact opposite.  It only took me a week or 2 to get totally used to having the screen as my main interface with the car.  The simplicity and intuitiveness of the screen is incredible and even executing tasks that are within an individual page or menu turn out to be simple and straightforward.  The same can be said about the relatively spartan interior with the lack of buttons and controls.  I wasn't sure if I'd be happy with this, but I've now gotten to the point that when driving my other cars it seems so distracting having so many knobs and buttons!  My main issues with the controls and interface is the poor performance of the rain sensing windshield wipers which should really have a sensitivity adjustment like pretty much every other car out there and the wonky turn signals which can be difficult to cancel out when you signal a lane change and accidentally push the lever too far.

The interior quality of this car is first rate.  Materials are super nice and the ""vegan"" leather feels just as nice as real leather in all temperatures and an added bonus is the ease of cleaning it.  I use unscented baby wipes and they will remove just about any amount of dirt or stain and return the seats to a brand new condition.  I'm not a fan of the shiny piano black trim, so I had that replaced with real matte carbon fiber which looks well and matches the external CF trim well.  Otherwise, the only complaints we have had are the lack of labels on the door openers which consistently confuse passengers who intuitively pull the emergency door releases in the front seats and are just confused in the rear seats, and the lack of a heated steering wheel as in the Model S.

The exterior fit and finish is by far the biggest disappointment on my car.  I know the Model 3s are notoriously inconsistent and mine has had a rear drivers side door that looks like it is open when viewed from the rear due to a slight mis-alignment and a hood that either was warped or misaligned.  I've had to force myself to overlook these as they don't cause any real problems and 99% of people would never notice.  There have also been a few blemishes in the white paint, but nothing major.

The driving experience itself is absolutely amazing on the Performance model.  Everything that has been written or shown on YouTube is correct as far as the extreme performance and acceleration of this car.  I've been impressed on the repeatability of its acceleration and power.  I only notice a real drop-off in power when my battery is super low.  Otherwise, the torque is absolutely intoxicating.

As far as range goes, my Performance model comes with the larger 20"" wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S summer performance tires, so I have not seen the same range as folks with the smaller (and much uglier) aero wheels, or even the 19"" wheels on the non-performance version.  I have a long commute daily between Cincinnati, OH and Columbus, OH which is around 100 miles and is mostly all on Interstate 71 which has a 70MPH speed limit.  In the summer on the stock wheels, my actual range for this commute has been around 270-280 miles.  On days when I'm not on the highway as much, the range goes up to ~300 miles per charge.  Since the stock Summer-only tires will not get me through the cold and sometimes snowy Ohio winters, I have purchased 2 additional sets of wheels/tires to experiment with different diameters and widths and their impact on range, performance, and looks.  

The first set are 18"" wheels with 235/45-18 Pirelli Sottozero 3 snow tires with the Tesla-specific acoustic foam lining.  These proved to be as quiet as the stock wheels/tires, and the ride is noticeable softer.  As expected, however, handling is also negatively impacted and I only
 have used these when it's super cold and snowy here in Ohio.  The second set I purchased are a staggered set of wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3+ all season tires.  The fronts have 235/35-20 tires on 8.5"" wide wheels and the rears have 275/30-20 tires on 10"" wide wheels.  These are by far the best looking and the wider rear wheels/tires provide a much more aggressive stance to the back end.  Handling is mostly on par with the stock wheels/tires although the stock Pilot 4S tires have noticeably more grip in corners and are quieter I think due to the Tesla-specific acoustic foam layer that the all season tires do not have.

I have seen a noticeable difference in range with the different tire/wheel sizes.  I try to bucket these into cold and warm weather performance.  Here are the averages I have seen from a range standpoint:

Stock 20"" wheels/summer tires - Warm: ~300mi, Cold: N/A (summer tires)
Staggered 20"" wheels/all season tires - Warm: ~280, Cold: ~190mi 
18"" wheels/snow tires - Warm: ~320mi, Cold: ~230mi

tesla,model-3,2019,Patricia, 05/29/2020,Emotional connection to a car again. FINALLY.,5,"I loved my first car which was a 69 VW Beetle I bought in 1979. Since then, I have had SUV’s, sporty cars, vans and in the last 15 years, hybrids.  I connected with my first car and no other until my Model 3.  It is the most awesome car.  Aside from never having to get gas again, the way it handles is an extension of me the driver.  Intuitive in a way I cannot explain. I love this car.  Smooth.  Super pick up.  Gorgeous.  And it takes good care of me when I forget something.

tesla,model-3,2019,Halley boy, 06/11/2020,M3 midrange 2019,5,"I’ve been driving the M3 MR 2019. Placed an incredible 35k miles (!) & had no major issues, just minor ones. There was a time where I would hear some small bangs while supercharging. So I called Tesla and had it serviced in a jiffy. They even gave me a Model S loaner because they had to keep the car for a few days to test it out after the service. Also, sometime ago I notice my rear left tire was loosing air constantly and had to be pumped up a couple of times. So I had it serviced again, & found out it had a nail. The shop was able to patch it up though, sparring me from needing to buy a new one. 

Long drives, even with the defunct midrange, is never a problem. I live in Texas & we have a pretty good number of supercharging stations here, some just opening recently (Austin). The car automatically calculates where the next charging would be & how long it would take. I did find the battery life had lesser range when long driving at night, with the headlights, a/c or heater, & sounds turned on. But still, the car would tell you where your range could take you farthest before needing to charge again. Also, I did notice the battery holds its charge better during the warmer climates over winter weather, though the difference is hardly a cause for concern. 

Speaking of charging, just for a heads up, charging to 80% of the battery capacity would take around 30 minutes or so. But if you want to have a full charge, it will take upto an hour. Charging slows down as the battery becomes packed with more juices. Keep that in mind for those long drives. 

Full self driving might be quite expensive, but is worth it (I chose it over the additional 60 miles of a long range battery). After all, its this technology that sets it apart from the rest of the car brands. The park assist, insane acceleration, and summon are an amusing & reliable trick & is a fool-proof method of impressing passengers & friends. But by far, driving assistance (especially on interstate & city traffic driving) is the best thing the car has to offer. Heck it makes long distance driving more enjoyable, as you have time appreciating the road even more. 

The over-the-air updates are also very much appreciated, making the car safer as well as packing it with more entertainment options. It comes unannounced, so just watch out for it regularly. 

All in all, its a car that would really serve you needs well. Whether it be casual driving or interstate, this car will not fail. With the outstanding features that aids you in maneuvering the vehicle safely and unparalled post-purchase & technical support, having any Tesla will without any doubt make driving a whole lot of a different level of fun, if just not one of a kind in itself.

Acceleration is immediately available on demand, and the 0-60 times range from 6.5 secs to 4.4(!), top speed 110-130 mph, depending on model. I also spent a half hour playing with the 17"" touchscreen at a Tesla store. It offers streaming music to Google maps and everything in between.

I drive a lot and hate driving hybrids with CVTs.  So when I could get an all electric performance car I took the plunge.  I usually prefer coupes to sedans, but since Tesla no longer made the Roadster, I went with the Model S.  I couldn't be happier.  The service is excellent, especially compared with my wife's Lexus.  If there's ever a problem, Tesla sends a valet out to get my car, leaves me a brand new loaner, fixes and washes it, and then brings it back to my house, all for free.  The car is big, but it still gets close to double Prius efficiency, all while I drive it as fast as I want.  Charging at home is also very convenient compared to stopping for gas.  The only drawback for me is it is slightly more prone to interior rattles than my past vehicles.  This could be because it doesn't make any engine noise, but overall it's still much quieter.

tesla,model-s,2013,txcattledog, 03/09/2013,Remarkable Car,5,"For over 100 years, cars have improved incrementally. 

That has changed. 

In the last year, the car has improved exponentially, thanks to the Tesla Model S. 

Everything about the Model S is better than an gas car - drive experience, design, engineering. The car has an intuitiveness and effortlessness that is unmatched - acceleration, handling, controls. It only lacks ease of long trips, but that is being solved with the supercharger network and is already irrelevant to many.

Daily, it excels - full every morning, at 1/4 the cost of gas, and 4 times the fun. We sold our Lexus when our Model S arrived and will part with our BMW for the Model X. Categorically. Unequivocally. Joyfully!!!"
tesla,model-s,2013,dwoodruff, 04/14/2013,"Fascinating, sickeningly fast, ultra-quiet, & no gas!",5,"I have owned my Model S Performance (P85) for 6 weeks. It is the most brilliant car I've ever owned (and I have owned a long string of very good cars, including Ferrari Cailfornia, Audi S8, Porsche 997 Carrera S, Infiniti QX56, Audi allroad, BMW M3...).
Automobile Magazine and Motor Trend had it right: it is a ""game changer."" The power delivery is unreal. It is dead silent.
It handles tight and flat.
It feels modern and well-assembled.
You can keep tabs of the car on an App on the iPhone, including warming it up from wherever you are so it is toasty warm when you climb in.
Park it in the garage and quickly plug in the charger, and it is full and ready to go every morning.
Just amazing."
tesla,model-s,2013,smccphillip, 06/13/2013,60 KWH Spring Suspension,5,"This is an initial quality review as we have only 1000 miles since we picked up the car last week.
The car has been flawless since we picked up in White Plains on June 4th and has exceed all my memories from the test drive.
Our wait was 2.5 months from the time of reservation.
I've formerly owned driver's cars like the Redline Saturn Sky an 530Xi 5-series sedan.
The Tesla feels even more refined than the 5-series and handles corners on rails like the Sky.
Its cargo room approaches a large SUV all while getting nearly 100mpg.
I believe our vehicle is one of the first without air suspension, and in my opinion there is no noticeable downside to ride and handling of the coils springs."

tesla,model-s,2013,Cord, 09/18/2020,104K miles and still a thrill!,5,"The silent mind blowing torque of the Tesla is second to none.  I get hopped up Mustangs, Chargers, Vettes at a stop light that try to jump ahead.  I didn't even see them trying until I hear the gas engines rev and before they even get to shift I'm gone.   So easy to drive and fits as much as my family minivan did.   I love cars and have had many, but I will not be going back to gas.    I have had no issues with the car and look forward to buying another one in another 100k or so.   I drove from Sacramento, CA to Maine stopping at as many national parks as possible and had free charging the whole way.  Then drove to Florida and back across the southern route through SoCal and back to Sac.   It was a comfortable easy ride.  We camped out some and stayed in hotels.  Every campground in America is a charging station, but we only used them for convenience.  There were plenty of Tesla Super charging stations all the way.     I found using 70,000 mile warranty tires works great because you tend to go through them in about 35k miles.  Just turn them in and get 50% off the next set.   My range has dropped about 10% in 104k miles.   Mine is a 2013 so it is was an early battery.   They have gotten twice as good now according to the specs.   My extended family drove mine and now they all have them too.   Lol!   Hope you have as much fun as I have!

tesla,model-s,2014,rickallen, 01/21/2015,American Ingenuity Electrified,4,"I have the P85D AWD. The powertrain alone is worth the cost of entry.  Faster than Ferrari performance, AWD, and every stomp of the accelerator doesn't burn a gallon of gas.  Flex your foot and your face and body are thrown back with nearly no accompanying noise.  The silence makes the acceleration somehow more rocket like, as if some unseen force is hurtling you toward the horizon.  This car is the future of powertrains.  "
tesla,model-s,2014,Joe, 10/24/2015,"""Free"" Green on green lightning",5,"30 Oct 2019 update.  Tesla corrected the app problem.  Nav is still background app, but you can now move camera view to upper half of screen.  Car is still performing as advised, great.  However, Supercharger is busy because of Model 3 sales.                         30 Oct 2018 update.  Just got Version 9 update.  Computer works quicker, but do NOT like the fact that you can no longer flip apps because the navigation app is the default screen and is always displayed in the background and only one other app can be displayed on bottom half of screen.  There still is no true emergency stop capability (will slow before impact, but will not prevent imact from happening) ... I know there could be and there should be.     

Traded in a '09 CTS-V.  Very similar in handling and performance ... S probably a bit faster and stable at high speed.  Plus, with much better mpg and silently sucks the headlights off the competition.   Love the body style and British Racing Green W/Grey Nappa leather interior color too.

We now have a Supercharger in Louisville, Ky need one in Prospect where I-265 intersects with Route 42 (Brownsboro Rd.) .  The title of my review needs to be changed to FREE Green Lightning.  Autopilot, parking,  and summon updates work as good, or better, (once you learn how to use them) as advertised.

tesla,model-s,2014,Randy Martin, 03/27/2015,Overpriced for what you get,3,"I have owned the P85D since December. Although the vehicle is incredibly fast and fun to drive the car is a disappointment. The front seats are very uncomfortable. We were promised new seats in February, didn't happen. The navigation system is the worst I have ever used except for the BMW.  Mr. Musk told us all the wonderful thing that the New D will do so I bought one. The car does none of these. My wife's Kia has more safety features than the D. It's coming we are told.,I am elderly and am hoping I live long enough to have my tesla have the features I was promised."

tesla,model-s,2015,hmp10, 02/01/2016,Zapped and Glad,4,"I'm a ""car guy"" and have owned 3 Audi R8's, a Mercedes SL55 AMG, a Corvette, and a Jaguar.  I traded in an R8 V10 Spyder for this car and haven't looked back.  This Tesla is significantly faster, just as sure-footed, far more practical (at least for local driving) and, in its own way, just as cool.  It is also has the structural solidity of a bank vault and the handling tautness and tactile feel of the best cars I have owned.

I thought I would miss the roar of the V10.  Instead, I find the barely audible whine and whoosh of the electric drive train just as appealing.  I thought I would miss the manual gear shifting of the R8.  Instead, I find the eerie silkiness of the Tesla drivetrain addictive to the point that driving my internal-combustion cars is now vaguely annoying.  I thought the regenerative braking would take some getting used to.  It took me about 30 seconds to adapt, and I now find it one of the best features of electric driving.  I thought the 17-inch screen would be distracting.  Instead, I find it the best driver interface I have ever seen in a car.

My biggest worry in buying the car was range.  Unfortunately, this is not a car I would take on a long road trip, as the supercharger network still requires too much bobbing and weaving off ideal routes to keep the car charged.  However, there is no amount of local driving that has left me anywhere near the end of the battery range.  I picked the car up at a dealer on the east coast of Florida and drove it home to the west coast.  I was driving well above the speed on which the range claims are based, I did some hard acceleration runs (this car requires no break-in), and I made a couple of detours for errands.  The car still had 103 miles of indicated range remaining when I got home.  Since then I have used the car for long days of running errands and lengthy pleasure drives and have yet to return home with less than 138 miles of indicated range remaining.

The downsides:

It's absurd to build a car with so little interior storage space, despite there obviously being room.  (This is the one area where Elon Musk's attempts to be stylistically chic backfire.)  Fortunately, EVannex makes a center console that matches the interior perfectly and helps with storage.  But I still miss door pockets.  On the other hand, the front and rear trunks offer immense trunk space for things you don't need to reach while driving.

Despite the car's large exterior dimensions, the rear seat is a bit cramped and difficult of entry and exit for adults.  Also, the rear seat backs (at least in the Executive Seating option) are not raked back quite enough due to the low roof line.  However, the upgraded Recaro front seats and the front seat accommodations in general are absolutely best in class.

Reliability and Service:

In 6 months of ownership the car has only needed service once, due to the failure of the door handles to retract.  I called Tesla service at 9:30 p.m. the evening it happened and, to my surprise, got an answer.  I was a bit aggravated at the prospect of having to take the car 100 miles to the nearest service shop.  But then I found out that Tesla had a service tech who works out of a truck in my town and who keeps a supply of parts in a local storage unit.  He was at my house before 9:00 a.m. the next morning and fixed the problem right in my driveway.  In short, it was most convenient and quickest repair I've ever had done on a car.  (It also turned out that the service tech was Buddy, the mechanic who worked on my R8 at the Audi dealer.  He had just moved to Tesla and was loving it.)

Since then there have been a few software glitches with the car, seemingly related to bugs in updates.  However, they have all disappeared of their own accord, probably as a result of correction downloads that came in overnight when the car is programmed to receive automatic updates.

Would I
 buy a Tesla again?  In a second . . . as long as it's not my only car (at least until there are more superchargers).

tesla,model-s,2015,Armand Mintanciyan, 01/08/2016,So far so good.....,5,"I went from a 2013 Mercedes SL550 to the 2015 Tesla P90D Ludicrous. I purchased (Dec 2015) all the options except for the extra seats and the winter package. Wish there was more options for exterior color, seat color, and trim. I chose Obsidian Black exterior , Black next gen seats, and piano black trim with white Alcantara Headliner. I was hesitant until I got the car but having driving in the car a few weeks now I am glad I chose the color combination I did.

I used to have Lunar Blue for the SL550 and burl wood trim and tan interior. I miss the wood/leather steering wheel (not available in Tesla).

Right before I committed to the car news came out about potential reliability issues. This did not help my nerves. No major issues (one minor one) but again only a few weeks driving.

The car is a beast. Super performance. Much better acceleration that the SL550 and much better transmission (Ludicrous mode). Smooth as silk. Alot more trunk space then the SL550.

Have had the car only a few weeks so I cannot compare reliability at this point. So far so good.

Things that I have notices as negatives from the SL550:

1. Headlights. In the SL550 when I made turns the headlights turned with the car. Doesn't seem that the P90D does this.
2. Windshield wipers look alittle ""cheap"" compared to the SL550. In fairness there have been pretty strong storms the last few days and they seemed to work well.
3. Sirius radio reception. I have been having problems with this. In the SL550 never had a problem with the Sirius radio. Have an appointment to have it looked at.
4. Front center console. I think this should have been standard in the P90D. I ordered this.

Had a 220V outlet installed in the garage. No issues charging. Have the car charge at 11pm at night with my tiered electric rates. Takes about 3 hours for a 60 mile round trip.

Would I do it all over again. Absolutely. This car is awesome.

tesla,model-s,2015,Nicholas Devaud, 12/05/2015,Best vehicle I've owned,5,"1. Driving an all electric vehicle takes a little adjusting as compared to gasoline. Once you get there, you'll never want a traditional gasoline/ICE car again.

2. Damage/repairs- an important factor in decision that is often not factored. This car has mostly aluminum vs steel constructions. It keeps car light, but it can cost more to repair. I would also caution buying if you are far (>75miles) from a service center. Services and repairs could be a hassle.

3. If you hate or can't adjust to new things - this car is not for you. 

4. Safety. My wife was recently hit by another driver who ran through a red light (estimated impacted was about 40-50mph). The Tesla was declared a total loss, but my wife survived the accident. In most other cars, I'm not sure she would have survived such an impact.   

5. No more dirty fuel (assuming your local utility provides you with clean energy)

6. Proactive service. The car communicates back with Tesla all the time. If it thinks there's a problem, Tesla service will proactively contact you to pick-up the car to have it checked and provide you with a loaner. When my wife was in accident, the first news of that accident I received was from Tesla service.

7. Remote monitoring. If you have kids... you can see where they are, how fast they are driving, lock/unlock car, pre-cool/heat the car before you use it, etc...

8. Charging - It's really easy at home and free while you travel out of your city using their supercharger network. By the time you finish your meal, the battery (which will give you realistically at least 240 miles range vs 265 EPA range) is nearly full again. We drive about 1,500 miles/month and electic bill is up about 30-40 / mth

9. No pesky dealerships, no negotiating. Buy online. Ask for help from sales or service centers. Just great modern service. Seems like most reviews complain about minor things in their cars. I've always found Tesla very accommodating to fix defects and make their customers happy.

About me - I've owned Lexus, Toyota, Nissan, Audi in past. I liked most of my cars, but never truly loved them. Tesla team - you guys are awesome.

* update 18months into ownership: love the car just as much than when I got it.

* update after 3years of ownership: I’ve had to service related actions over the last 12 months. One of my door handles ceased to function and a SW update bricked my car. In both separate instances, Tesla came to my home and fixed the problem. I was proved a loaner free of charge when my car was bricked and they could not immediately fixed the issue. I still love this car and we bought a model 3 earlier this year. We are now 100% free from fossil fuel.

** update Dec 2019: We still love the car even after 4 years of ownership. since last update, I’ve had another door handle break. It took a month to get that fixed. They just added another service center near me. It still takes too long in this area (SoCal) to get car serviced.

tesla,model-s,2015,Bernie Kuzava, 09/02/2015,Touch screen failure a major disaster,5,"I have now owned this 2015 (not 2013) Tesla Model S for 5 years and 65K miles. The major issues that required service included a door handle repair, a window that would not close, Steering U-Bolts required replacement, replaced weatherstripping deterioration on roof and currently the touch screen has failed rendering the car undriveable. This is a common problem after 65K miles. Parts are hard to come by. Car can not be charged and directional signal lights do not function. Cost of repair is north of $3,000.00.

However, one test drive in the Tesla on ""insane mode"" and I was sold. I absolutely love it. Fast (got my first speeding ticket in 10 years), sleek, quiet, comfortable and filled with great electronics, it makes me supremely happy every morning as I hop in for my commute. The fact that it saves me thousands of dollars in gas costs, has cheaper insurance rates and is 100 percent Electric is just the cherry on top. I immediately invested in Tesla stock, FYI. That's how much I love this car.

tesla,model-s,2015,V500, 01/04/2016,Love/Hate relationship with a 3 months old car,3,"Too many quality issues - our heating system did not work in our brand new car - we had to take it to the dealership twice (not a fun experience!!). We took the car for our Ski trip - the snow chains literally cut the car  - we haven’t found other cars having this issue. As per Tesla this happened because we did not use Tesla recommended snow chains but the Tesla recommended snow chains were out of stock. There was really no other option.
Repair/Dealership issues - Tesla takes too much time for any repairs because it takes too long for service centers to get parts and also service centers are really busy because there are so many issues with Tesla cars. Also from our experience the service centers guys don’t care much - you are locked in once you have bought the car as there is no competition (Tesla only sends parts to their own service centers). The service centers also have a long waiting line for loaner cars - again because they have too much work because of all the car issues. 
Battery Range Issues - Don’t believe the range that Tesla advertises or shows in the car. It never gives you as much miles as advertised and in our experience it could dropped down to as little as 55-60% of the listed range (happened to us because we had to go through a traffic jam)  
Interior Design Issues - In the interior the storage space is an issue - there is no storage on the doors (which other cars have). They have a big space next to the control screen but it is difficult to use as there are no compartments (Tesla sells you a console for $600 for that). The cup holders in the car are placed at a very inconvenient place - it is very difficult to put the cups there or take cups out
Big car with Good acceleration/Good for the Environment - Very nice cosmetic features which includes a nice screen with all controls, handles etc. It has a very good acceleration and fun to drive car.  It looks good from outside and it is good for environment. It is also pretty big with a lot of storage space (Frunk provides additional storage)

Overall it is a good car but if you are switching from a regular Gas car - you will definitely feel some pain on long trips and also with the current quality issues you probably need an extra car at home to drive around while your car is at the service center!

tesla,model-s,2015,JKB, 07/16/2018,2018 Tesla Model 3 or 2015 Model S 85?,5,"I was recently considering the purchase of a new Tesla Model 3. There were a lot of unknown factors in the Model 3 including cost, wait time, availability of federal tax incentive and inability to test drive the car. Additionally, since there haven't yet been enough resales of Model 3's, leasing is not an option. After looking at a Model 3 in one of the Tesla showrooms, I still plunked down my $1,000 reservation and explored the Tesla website learning about the cars. On the website I found a list of used Teslas including the 2015 Model S 85 that I ultimately purchased. The car is in flawless condition and is trimmed with deep blue paint, deluxe leather seats, sunroof, front console, Tech Package with Autopilot and Audio Package. It also came with what appears to be a new charger cable pack, warranty, unlimited Supercharging and AT&T connectivity. My loaded 2015 Model S 85 was roughly the same price as a new, well trimmed, long range Model 3 (before tax incentive for which I may or may not have been eligible). One downside is that the 2015 does not have the hardware to add autonomous driving capability when it becomes available. The driving experience of the Model S is like no other car I have ever driven and I am extremely pleased with my purchase decision.

tesla,model-s,2015,PZ, 09/07/2016,First 18000 miles with a P90D Ludicrous,5,"Before this car I had a modded 2008 Mercedes sl55 AMG with 670WHP.  I swore I would never sell the sl55 because it felt so special when I drove it.  After driving the P90D Ludicrous for a while I went to drive the Mercedes and it felt dated and slow!  So I sold the Mercedes.  Tesla has amazing performance and is the most practical car I have owned in a long time.  Autopilot is a whole new level of luxury.  The ride on my car with the sport air suspension and staggered 21 in rims is still quite good.  I think this car is an amazing value and I would recommend it to anyone.

I've had BMW 3,5,7 z4, and X5 series as well as several Mercedes S and the tens of thousand$$$ in maintenance bills that go along with them and they don't begin to compare.  I've cancelled my subscription to several car magazines because Tesla is the only manufacturer that interests me anymore for less then $100k...nothing beats a Ferrari in my mind but don't get me started on Italian maintence.   Tesla service has been excellent with me and although there have been a few items that had to be repaired under warranty (glue on window and a loose screw on the armrest) its no where near the list that's gone wrong on several ""new"" cars.  The Bimmers/Mercedes spent so much time in the shop eating money looking nice on the shop floor(because they didn't work) and that's no fun😢  So basically if you can afford one, get a Tesla.  If you can't afford one, sell your kidney... I promise you won't be disappointed.

tesla,model-s,2015,Pam Epstein, 01/31/2018,"""Not quite ready for Prime Time""",4,"The GOOD:  The car accelerates and handles beautifully!!  It is a dream to drive on the highway.  Its effortless and the technology is very cool.  I love the big screen. THE BAD:  The mileage available is about 1/4-1/3 less then what it says when you get into the car.  If your driving was strictly local it wouldn't be much of a problem, but for any trip over 200 miles, it is a big problem .  The heat and AC is very weak and inefficient.  You have to crank the heat to 80 and the fan on at max is blowing lukewarm air at best.  The car never gets comfortable temperature wise.  The heated seats and steering wheel also are not very strong.  For the price of the car, I think the interior is cheap looking.  Besides the awesome screen, the leather seats are mediocre and not the most comfortable  and the rest of the dashboard is just okay.  I wish I loved everything about this car, but its not quite ready for ""prime time"" in my opinion.

The reason everyone is crazy about this car is not because it is electric.  It is because this car far out performs every other car on the market.  Seeing is believing.  There is a reason that the car in a few short years has become the best selling luxury car on the planet. The car innovates in everything they do.

From self holding breaks when you stop at a stop light, to down loading upgrades, to the best user interface by far, virtually no maintenance, to batteries that still have 95% of original range at 200,000 miles on average.  The list of greats is too long to list here.

My 85D I have timed to 60 consistently in the 3.8-3.9 range with over 85% charge.  My battery only lost 5 miles from the original 270 on a full charge.  I can consistently match or beat the rated miles during the warmer months.  Winter I get a little below since the battery pack has a hard time staying warm. I charge it at home on a nema 14-30 and can recoup my average daily commute under three hours at home.  Only issue I have is with Tesla and not the car so much.  Tesla nerfed the supercharging rate on the older cars so expect to spend about 30% longer at a supercharger then the newer cars.  Wish it had the newer touchscreen which can play netflix and youtube but other than that wouldn’t give it up for anything other than a newer Model S. Very pleased.

tesla,model-s,2015,William Calfee, 09/14/2019,best car I have ever owned,5,"I bought this car new in 2015. Now, 4 years and 100,000 miles later, we still love it. It is still quick and fun to drive. even the old autopilot is wonderful especially for long trips on the interstate. Even this old technology has saved us from several crashes. I'm a geek, so I am eyeing the new Model 3... and we like to car camp, and travel with a Cello, so the family is pushing to keep the Model S...

tesla,model-s,2016,Tony Barre, 11/07/2016,Unavailable Repair Parts Tarnishes Tesla Image,3,"When I bought my new Tesla Model S in May 2016 and for months before I was proud to be part of “accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.”  I talked it up with my friends and family and even with strangers I met at Starbucks.  I got 2 of my kids to pre-order the Model 3.

Then I ran over a truck tire tread on the freeway, causing $6k of damage to the bumper and undercarriage.  Since then, the car has been at Kniesl's Repair Shop in Roseville, CA, a Tesla-authorized repair shop.  It has been there for 6 weeks now awaiting repair parts, with no ETA for those parts.  In fact, Kniesl's tells me that they have 3 other Teslas in their shop in similar condition awaiting parts for as much as 3 months.  After 4 weeks, I contacted Tesla using the form on their web site.  No response.  At all.

If “the world's transition....” involves no repair parts, I want no part of it, and neither should you.  If “the world's transition....” includes the inability to forecast a delivery date for repair parts, I am ashamed to be a part of it.  If “the world's transition....” entails a complete lack of interest in post-sales customer service, I am afraid of it.

What would you do if your car was unavailable for 6 weeks with no forecast for when it would be available again?  Would you feel like you were accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy?

tesla,model-s,2016,Peter, 10/05/2016,I'll never go back to ICE after having a Tesla,5,"I've had my Model S60 for three months now and its great. I have the smallest battery pack and its still plenty of range. The one time I went beyond its range I was able to quickly charge up with the free superchargers. You might knock it for the weight and size but the pickup is crazy for a car this size and the weight is all down low in the battery pack. The Autopilot is amazing for Bay Area freeway congestion. The only small knock is the lack of door storage. I have seen the Model X does much better here and I suspect in time they will add this to the S. I rented one on Turo for a long weekend and it really helped me decide to go for it.
"
tesla,model-s,2016,Mark Levin, 08/30/2016,We own 2 of the orginal Tesla Model S,5,"UPDATE Mar 2020
We traded the first Model S 60 for a 2017 Model S 90D. We had that car for 5 years and put 106k miles on it with the battery degrading only 10 miles from new. that car was sold within 3 days and the person is still driving it. Tesla was able to upgrade the navigation system for him and a few other improvements.

I now have 101k miles on my P85 and that battery has degraded about 20 miles from new. The Performance models tend to use more energy, I would not recommend purchasing it, as the car is outstanding without it. That and the 22in wheels are something that only costs money and energy and is a complete waste for most people. 

We still love the cars and will plan on purchasing another maybe in a few years. My son has had the Model 3 for about 2 years and loves it. Many improvements in the M3, it charges faster and has a better a/c unit. Cant go wrong with a TESLA.


We have 2 MS. The first one I ordered a smaller battery 60, with only 2 options, leather interior and pano roof. We received the car in May 2013. That car now has over 85k miles and has only been in the shop for one repair very early. Some guide clips on the Pano roof broke. It was quickly repaired and I was given a new MS to drive while the repair was being done. The car looks and runs like it did new and we have only lost 3 miles of range in the battery! We are told to charge the car 90% every night, and when new it totaled 185 miles and now it charges to 182 miles at 90%. My wife drives that car about 90 miles per day, round trip to work. I purchased a used one in Nov 2014, with 15k miles. It is a MS P85, at that time it was just about the most powerful car in the lineup. Today they offer 90D and P100D models. But I don't think they have anything on mine. The car charges to 230 miles each night at 90%. Realistically when driving at or above normal highway speeds you will only get about 80% of the range, so need to be careful when doing long distance trips. But around town, you never need to be concerned with range. The only weak point about the car is that it is rather plain on the interior. I don't mind it is nice enough for me. And the advanced technology over rides the lack of pizzaz. Like many people who own this car, I doubt I would ever go back to a gas car as my primary vehicle. Overall it is an amazing car.

tesla,model-s,2016,Tim L, 10/19/2016,Still Revolutionary,4,"Electric cars are here to stay.  Amazing range, acceleration and handling.  If you can afford the hefty price tag, these cars have little to no maintenance so the actual cost during ownership is small in comparison to non-electric cars.  The autopilot feature is a game changer for folks who drive daily in traffic.  Your right foot will be bored and your blood pressure will drop.  It takes the stress out of driving while being stuck for hours in traffic.  That alone is worth the hefty entry price for these cars!  
Beware of any body shop work that may be required because it takes forever to get basic parts from Tesla and when it's in stock they ship using slow ground transport from a warehouse far far away.
Tesla customer service is terrible! The product is exceptional but they do not care about how they treat loyal customers when they are repeat buyers. For Texas residents, they have the audacity to charge you for the right to fully pay for your car before shipping it which takes 10 days to arrive. So in conclusion, closing costs are higher and you get to wait 10 days for delivery. Win/win for Tesla but not for their customers!

tesla,model-s,2016,Eric H., 02/11/2019,AMG owner loves Tesla.,5,"I have a  2016 90D.  I bought this used from Tesla because with their certified pre-owned program, I got my car for a 44% discount from new with only 23,000 miles on it with a 4 year/ 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty AND it comes with lifetime supercharging!  It was only 2.5 years old when I bought it and because there is a Supercharger 2 miles from my house, I have been saving the equivalent of $300 dollars a month in gasoline.  This was a big factor in my buying the Tesla.  I decided against the P90D because I did not want to lose the extra distance in exchange for a quicker 0-60 time. I also own a 563 hp AMG SLS and it sits in my garage because the Tesla is just so much fun to drive. I have learned that if you see a Tesla on the road, and you are merging on to an on ramp or from zero, you just let them go first, because they will pretty much leave you if you are not in the perfect gear.  I had a spot on my screen, so Tesla sent a tech out to my house to replace it.  I was blown away with that. Time saver and no cost. It did take 2 weeks to get the part in. As much as I love the Tesla, there is no way I would ever have it as my ONLY car.  I think it is a great primary vehicle, but  I would want a backup , just in case. The fact that I just put solar on the house makes me feel even more socially responsible that I am using 5% of the gas I used to use, saving hundreds of dollars monthly, can charge the car with solar power and the car is a ton of fun and comfortable.  Now that used pricing is totally within the reach of most people and you can essentially get a used one for the price of a Honda accord, these make a great case for going electric!

tesla,model-s,2016,Dom33928, 03/24/2017,Best car I ever drove!,5,"I had a lot of cars in my life: BMW, Audi, Lexus, Porsche, Alfa Romeo; nothing can compare to my Tesla Model S 60! Acceleration and handling are phenomenal! The design outside and inside is superb. I am in real estate and the large screen and navigation are so helpful, so is the web browsing. The seats have an excellent support and are very comfortable. The car is extremely quiet! I also own a BMW Convertible and when I drive it, it seems to be a car from another era... Tesla Service is excellent (I had just to call them to rotate the tires so far) and when you purchase (or lease) the car hey are not pushy. I chose the S60 and I am doing 211 miles on full charge, which is way enough. I Have travelled through Florida and there is no range anxiety with the superchargers. The quality of the materials inside is ok but not perfect and there are a very small rattles sometimes but as there is no engine noise, you are more eager to notice them. It is really the best car I ever had! I will never go back to gas engine cars!

tesla,model-s,2016,terra firma, 04/25/2017,Misled by videos,3,"I was very enthused by the videos on the tesla website and the fact that the driver did not have to do anything, the test drive was very different. First off, on AP, it kept going over the double yellow line and the third time it did it the car coming towards me honked...I was scared for my life in the first 5 min of my drive ! Then the limitation of 35mph on back roads ! So there is no point A to B self drive yet. That was a con in the videos. Whole AP tech is still in beta mode. Self park was a joke. It just went half-way and then the dealer says he doesnt want it to hit bushes so self-parks it. Car essentially needs data and they give you 4 years for free after which you have to pay for it. Wasn't the least bit impressed, it was just a polished version of what my $30k Forester could also do; but going over the double yellow, 3 times, was a bummer.

tesla,model-s,2016,JOHN C, 01/02/2017,The Funnest Machine of My Long Life,5,"I have never loved a car before I started driving my 85 Model S three years ago. (I grew up in a dealer's family and had to drive one clunker after another every six weeks).                       The no-pressure, 12-minute buying experience has to be experienced to be believed -- it's like buying a computer (with wheels). NOTHING HAS EVER GONE WRONG WITH MY TESLA!  And the two annual test-check-ups in my home's garage were a dream.  Ownership is so cheap that it's like buying a $200,000 car for half the price -- if you keep it for 5 to 7 years.           Okay, that's the biggest problem with owning a Tesla. Sure, the car gets better every month with every overnight software release, but the damn hardware innovations entice most owners to buy a new one in a couple of years!

tesla,model-s,2016,John Franklin, 07/23/2017,OMG Game Changing Car...Part 2,5,"AT 39000 miles everything from my original review hold true:

Pros: Best car I've ever owned, driven or been a passenger in. Out performs any exotic car on the road for a fraction of the price and does it without making noise or burning fossil fuel. I have the first version Auto Pilot(AP1) and it's a technological marvel(yes you can text and drive safely...but of course don't;). Due to OTA(over the air) updates my Tesla is a better more advanced car then when I purchased it over a year ago. Cons: It will ruin every other car on the road for you. You'll no longer look at a Ferrari, Bentley, Maserati, Rolls Royce etc. the same way because the Tesla absolutely blows them all away.

Note: Just got completed 5000 mi road trip using AP1 99% of the time...so awesome!

tesla,model-s,2016,TeslaTan, 12/24/2016,"Better than my Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7 series, etc",5,"My second Tesla S, at 45,000 miles, still the best car I've ever owned. No repairs at all . . . excellent handling . . . superb service . . . Autopilot superior (I use it all the time). I test drove all of the other competitors, and all of them are more than inferior! Why would I pay close to $45,000 for a BMWie (with a range lower than the new LEAF), if I can own a Tesla 3 for the same price . . . or less soon? But the most important difference is the Tesla supercharger network . . . invaluable! I traveled from Portland to Seattle recently, and was visiting Chargepoint or Blink fast chargers close to my hotel. None worked, and some listed on Plugshare did not even exist! Can you imagine taking a Porsche or Audi on a longer trip relying on 220V chargers, or the few fast chargers around (that very often don't work)? I plan to drive to Boston early next year again, and I know I will get there without any problems! Keep up the good work, Elon! We all know the green-eyed monsters constantly attacking you, but we--the actual users of your product--know who is sponsoring them! Our information is based on nothing but first-hand experience . . .  and not on Bill Maurer's idiotic opinions!   


I bought a new Tesla S90 a few month ago. It is even better than my 2013 Tesla S which was sold to a Washington State car dealer who is very happy with it! I especially like the 4-wheel drive of the Tesla S 90, the Autopilot capabilities including the self-driving capability which I use for most of my driving (simply superb!), the HEPA air filtration system, the adaptive lighting, and the extended driving range (300 miles). Still the best looking car around! No wonder more and more car companies are imitating the Tesla S looks, but even Mercedes, Audi, and BMW cannot come close to the styling of Tesla S and X! Tesla S continues to be the best car I have driven so far. It is absolutely reliable with not a single repair bill for over 100,000 miles of driving. I reserved a Tesla 3, and cannot wait for it to arrive.

Earlier review (for my 2013 Tesla S):
My 2013 Tesla S 85 reached 90,000 miles last week! So far, the total repair bill for it was $29,00 for a flat tire. Unbelievable, my Tesla S still has its first brakes, and I just just replaced its second set of tires! I drove it over 8,000 miles to the East Coast and back (free-of-charge, using super chargers) with not a single problem. My batteries (at 90,000 miles) are at 95%! In comparison, my Mercedes S-Class had cost me about $10,000 in repairs at the same mileage, not to speak of the very high maintenance cost! There is no other car on the market that is so good-looking, practical, and reliable as the Tesla S! I just traded in my Tesla S 85 for a 90 D. What a different (pleasant) experience dealing with Tesla staff in comparison to the high pressure gas-guzzler-dealer-vultures! I felt like a valued customer and not like a persecuted victim! Taking my first trips in a new 90 D, I was in awe with all the improvement and technical refinement! My son owns a high-end AUDI, and his new car has been in the repair shop repeatedly for a total of 3 weeks due to problems with the software. My neighbor had so many problems with the software of his new high-end BMW that his dealer finally gave him a brand new replacement car. They both will switch to Tesla S cars in the near future because of my excellent experience with Tesla cars. No wonder the European high-end car manufacturers are utmost disturbed, to say the least, and are trying to catch up! But look at their first EV products so far: Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen E-cars without fast charge ports, allowing just pitiful 85 miles of range. Expensive and pathetic!  Keep up your excellent work, Elon Musk!

Really wanted to get the lastest model a and and she wouldn't trade her's for the world. So i broke down and gave up my beloved F355 and my BMW convertibles for the model s . Granted the P85 was faster than the F355 and the model S on day one . Would the 60d match up . The car is amazing . It keeps all the great aspects of our super reliable P85 while adding the surprisingly helpful even in Florida  all wheel drive . My first impression were the next generation leather seats that feel as good as the Ferrari and an improvement on the 2013 p85 . The 2nd is the new premium interior . Although the stock model s is nice the premium interior adds to already beautiful cabin . The 3rd has been the performance . The car with the All wheel drive has amazing acceleration and stunning efficiency . The number of miles per charge is much improved on an already very good number . With the super charger network here in Florida can't even imagine range ever being a problem .  Love this car although I admit I miss my Ferrari a little .

It's to the point that as my family grows, I'm going to be moving up to the Model X next. The car is lightning fast, thrilling to drive, fun to share and just a great experience every day I get into it. Tesla service is incredible, they've taken care of so much without even charging for it as I've brought the car in a few times for other services. Only minor glitches over time that were fixed very quickly. I highly recommend this to anyone who can afford it and live without the noise of an engine, replacing fluids, breaks etc. Seriously the only real maintenance is windshield wipers, rotate tires, alignment (if you're clumsy) and possibly breaks.

tesla,model-s,2016,2 Tesla Owner, 11/27/2019,Poor Service Ruins a Great Car,2,"This is truly a great car, with minimal moving parts to require service. HOWEVER, if you ever need service, the whole experience degrades to frustration and disappointment. I have had occasional alerts of ""service required - car may not restart.""  Fine, you just call the local service center and set up an appointment, right? No. 
In order to set up anything with service, you have to use the app. You can call the phone number, and the automated message tells you to use the app and then hangs up. Even if you have a ""your car may not restart"" message, you are placed into line for a service appointment - in my most recent experience 3 weeks later. Good luck. Last year, I had a critical message telling me to seek service immediately. I did some forum searches and found a different number to call, warning me that I will be on hold for a while. The timer on my phone indicated that I was on hold for 1 hour 35 minutes before a service rep picked up. He logged in, saw that I had a critical issue, and got me in the next morning.
Inattentiveness to customers like this is insulting, not to mention obnoxiously time consuming. I have converted from a Tesla advocate to a guy who warns potential customers of exceedingly poor service. I no longer advise friends, family, strangers in the parking lot to buy a Tesla. My current Tesla will be my last."
tesla,model-s,2016,drjnieto, 09/28/2017,Poor customer service,1,"I’ve had a tesla for almost a year. It had several problems that where fixed. Yesterday my rear tire was punctured with an object on the road. 
I called Tesla roadside and my car was transported to the service center. 
I called early to make sure I had my car back on the same day  
Unfortunately there where NO spare tire or inventory tires in stock. Then there where NO tesla loaners cars. 
For a 100k+ vehicle that doesn’t come with a spare tire the support is ridiculous and unacceptable. 
I’m left without a car for a problem that could be resolved in 5 minutes with a spare tire. I had a full day a Patients to see at different hospitals and had to cancel on them because I had no reliable transportation. 
I called management and I’m still waiting for a call back.

tesla,model-s,2016,Karen, 02/09/2018,Love it but...,5,"Drove my new MS for 5 days before someone rear ended me on the freeway.  Parts--like a bumper and underneath metal part--were a little difficult for a ""non-authorized"" repair shop to get.  I only considered this shop since they have done work before for me  and they do just do unbelievably beautiful  work and are very honest and since the Tesla service place does not do body work... .  Getting the paint--Tesla uses a thee-step process which makes for a gorgeous paint job-- was a problem as Tesla does not sell the paint they use--even to their authorized dealers.  The place I used finally  found a perfect match and I now have the car back.  Two and a half weeks in all for a $1500.00 job.

Then you factor in the acceleration ... wow ... the regenerative breaking and you almost never have to use your brakes again.... The car will direct you to supercharges and not allow to run out of charge... It can park it self ... it can drive itslelf. It can find music or call people in your contact list. It remembers all your settings for your seat, mirrors and steering wheel position. It has more trunk room than almost any other car. The rear seats fold down giving even more room.

I was going to buy a Jeep grand Chereokee,because I wanted something I could put my bike and my surfboard into, and still go on business meetings.  After I compared the true cost of ownership over 5-10 years, this car beat it.  Now I believe this car beats most ICE cars for 10 years +, in affordability.  I paid 64k after rebates.  I hear there are only about 4 moving parts in the entire drive train, including the pedal, and the wheels, vs. 100s of moving, breaking parts in an ICE car.   I heard that the motor lasts about 1 million miles, and the battery is averageing about 500k miles, and I would expect no other major problems, since there isn't much to break.

tesla,model-s,2016,Dr S - BMW Owner, 08/31/2020,Its not a BMW - but thats OK,5,"No way can this thing corner with the responsiveness of a BMW 3 or 5 series.  Single speed driving allows much faster acceleration and deceleration that materially changes the driving experience.  Take your foot off the ""gas"" and it feels like you are in 2nd gear.  If someone tries any annoying passive aggressive ""box you in maneuver"" you can pass them before they can pull ahead.  You can pretty much pass everyone - all the time.  Its liberating!   Having said that, I tend to drive it more cautiously than with my BMWs.  

Tesla has engineered so many small things into the driving experience that when I return to other cars I am reminded how much they are missing.  Free power for life, no key entry, radio that plays when you enter, light that set to your liking, stereo controls that actually work. Even so, I don't think I will ever use Autopilot and I can park the car myself. 

Overall, this is an entertaining, sometimes ecstatic, driving experience.
"
tesla,model-s,2017,Roger Peng, 07/23/2017,Never seizes to amaze,5,"I read a lot of rave reviews prior to purchase, and I come from a Porsche. Yet, this car still exceeds expectations and amazes me to no end. Power delivery is so instant and smooth that you almost feel like you're floating through air. After driving this car, any gas car now feels outdated. People say the car is expensive, but you get so much for your money, and you get stuff money can't buy elsewhere, such as the amazing auto pilot with lane change capability, parallel and perpendicular self parking, over the air software updates, free LTE web surfing and music streaming etc. Operational convenience and user experience is off the charts. I never use my key. Just go to the car; door handle opens automatically; sit down and drive. Some people say the fit and finish doesn't measure up to other high end marques.  That's not so much the case after the 2016 refresh with Model X style seats. The fact is that the interior is extremely comfortable. After a long drive you are guaranteed to feel more pampered than in a Rolls Royce, because most of the coachwork stuff is just visual, and doesn't really provide additional comfort. I drove a Jaguar sedan for many years when that was considered the magic carpet ride. Compared to a Model S it's not even in the same league. Besides the attributes of the car itself, there are just so many benefits to ownership, like never having to go to the gas station, never having to take the car to get a smog check, never having to get an oil change, reduced need for brake service due to regen, car pool lane privilege, etc.. As far as I can see, this car has no competition, and I can't see how anyone would opt to spend similar money on a Mercedes, BMW or Lexus.

tesla,model-s,2017,Bill F, 06/22/2017,Very Cool but not Cushy - 27 Months Later,5,"Original Review -Purchased a 75D that has far exceeded my expectations! The 75D is not the quickest of the Tesla bunch but I find it plenty fast for my needs. The acceleration is impressive, quick, and quiet. Compared to a similarly priced Mercedes or Lexus, however,  the seats on a long trip do not provide the same level of comfort. Everything else about the car is just plain cool and technologically advanced. The view out the glass roof is amazing for rear passengers. On the pricey side, but it's no longer on my bucket list.

Update - After 14 months of ownership I still find it impressive and fun to drive.  The visibility out the rear-view mirror isn't great so I always drive with the rear camera on and viewed on the top half of the iPad-like display - love this feature. Original navigation system had flaws but a recent software upgrade improved it - now powered by Google Maps. Occasional free software upgrades continue to improve the vehicle. Nice to have free lifetime supercharging on long trips. When using nav system the computer calculates if there is enough charge to get to your destination. If not, it will direct you to supercharging locations along the way. 

Update - Another follow-up after 27 months - Still an amazing feeling to drive after 2+ years. Had a minor noise issue with the front window but the service center took care of it quickly.  While there I requested a performance software upgrade (my model did 0-60 in 5.3 secs) and it was loaded free of charge (now 0-60 in 4.3) a huge difference. Once again not ""ludicrous speed"" but still plenty fast and more than I'll ever need.  The battery range has degraded by approximately 2% since inception but quite acceptable to me. 

So, would I buy it again? Definitely!

tesla,model-s,2017,Bill, 05/28/2020,Repairs are a problem,2,"When you need repair parts for the car they are not readily available.  In my case the MCU went bad after 30 months (2017 Model S) and Tesla has not even given me a date when a replacement will be available and it has already been almost 2 weeks.  This is the computer that controls all the car functions.  It's hard to believe that a major car manufacturer wouldn't have ready stocks of such an essential component of a $100,000 automobile that is not even 3 years old."
tesla,model-s,2017,James Malarkey, 11/02/2017,I've owned a lot of cars,5,"At an early age I had an unquenchable thirst from performance, reading virtually every single R&D from 1996 to 2017.  I pursued power buying the best options available or testing it on the track.  Having owned over 52 cars, and peddle time, behing the  Ferrari, 458 F40, Acura NSX, and Porsche 993 GT3RS I thought I'd hit the pinnacle, but none compares to the Tesla...  The Tesla to a car guy is a stealth bomber to the airforce, anything on the road expect a nuclear explosion. There's nothing like it!  in standard form it seats 5, has class leading technology, and weighs 4500 lbs, yet will shred 0-60 in 4.2 seconds.  It's so quite that when you speed people don't know how to react?  There is no way to justify the speed as there's no noise, it's quite, like a mouse farting... no-one hears it. Speed isn't it's only game, utilization is off the charts! The car has two trunks, front and rear. The front alone is enough to store the groceries, the rear is large enough to put your living room in it. It's literally that big, and seems to have endless room.  For me, and really the reason why I bought it was the enhanced autopilot, which allows me to dart down the road while answering emails and making follow up conversations, which gives me a leading edge over my competitors, and sets me apart from the heard. Bottom line I love it, and I hope it continues to impress.

tesla,model-s,2017,W.A., 09/29/2017,I love it.....but not perfect,5,"Things I love: styling, performance, large info center, smooth acceleration, no gas stations, low maintenance costs, incredible sound system, frunk and sub-trunk, rear cargo space, HOV lane, federal tax credit, summons feature, replacement parts seem nicely priced, my first Service Center experience was excellent, my first body shop experience was very good, many people think you are ""cool"" and environmentally friendly (and you are).          Things I wish were better: fit and finish of body parts (not up to premium car standard), auto pilot still not a wow...needs more development, blind spot monitor is below expectations for such an advance vehicle, difficulty getting in and out of front seat...if you are tall, the front seat goes behind the ""B"" pillar too far thus the entering and exiting is more difficult. Final Verdict. I love the car. I doubt I would ever buy an ICE car again.

tesla,model-s,2017,RJ, 04/24/2018,Thinking about a Model S? JUST WAIT,3,"The Model S is in many ways a great car...just don't expect all the functions to work all of the time. I've owned a Model S for 13 months. My salesperson told me that most Tesla buyers had never paid more than $40,000 on a vehicle. I was in that same boat. So, I expected a lot. Also, prior to the Model S, I owned Toyotas and Hondas, so I was used to reliability. But, two days after I took delivery, there was a computer glitch that prevented my car from moving and stranded me at work. Since then, I've had to call for service probably a dozen times.  Most recently, my touchscreen will just blank out while I'm driving. Tesla reviewed my car logs several times, but was unable to fix this problem. The navigation system has frozen a few times, my streaming radio does not always work and my bluetooth audio just stopped working yesterday. Every few weeks, you'll get an update that purports to fix the recent problems, but in my experience, seems to cause a number of new problems. I have memorized how to reboot the touchscreen. Tesla replaced the touchscreen and it seems to work fine now. On the bright side, the car is stylish, the acceleration is very quick and the customer service reps are polite (even if they can't fix the problems). Tesla is like a new computer-company - they still have to work out the glitches.  Also, my car has lost about 15 miles or range in 13 months and about 17,000 miles.

tesla,model-s,2017,Pete V., 02/14/2018,Just an Amazing Car!,5,"I custom ordered my car on Sept 1, from the factory and it was delivered on Sep 30, 2017. I have researched and saved up for the last 3 years to purchase this car. After owning it for the last 4 months, I enjoy every time I drive it, it's truly an AMAZING car! The power (0 to 60mph = 4.2 seconds for 75D), interactive functions, safety and the ride quality is unmatched for this starting price point (80k, with other options 90k) and ZERO emissions and Free Supercharging for life! That free supercharging alone can save you about $15k (100k miles @ $3.30/g super in CA), also no oil/filter changes. I also own a Jaguar, love to drive it UNTIL I purchased the Tesla, now I can't / don't want to drive it as it seems so outdated in all aspects. I would recommend anyone to test drive this car and see for yourself!

Update as of Feb 14, 2020, over two years now and this car is still AMAZING!!! I had several over the air updates that has added many new functions and increased the value of my car. The car's performance and function are better now then is was two years ago. I also have a Jaguar, that I love driving and now every time I drive it, I feel like yikes, I have to ""start"" it, wait for it to warn up, driving it seems slow compared to the Tesla (0-60mph 4s) and wait for the car to go and the Autopilot is AWESOME on the Tesla, LOVE THIS CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Test drive one and you will see the difference.

tesla,model-s,2017,Richard from Arkansas, 07/15/2018,Unbelievably superb car and loads of fun.,5,"The car is not cheap but with gas savings and the $7500 tax credit it gets much better. This car is a real testament to practical technology. During the year we have had the car we have received several updates that added thousands of dollars worth of ""accessories"" that would have to be purchased upfront with other vehicles. When new technology is available it is simply sent with an over the air update. My wife and I both love the car and thoroughly enjoy the totally different driving experience from an ICE (internal combustion engine) car. The one petal driving (because of regenerative breaking) and the true sports car handling are truly exceptional. The car (ours is a 90D) is blazing fast (zero to 60 in appx. 3.7 or 8 seconds). We like this car far better than any we have ever owned including Lexus, Infinity, Audi and Cadillac. Due for its first annual inspection in a few weeks and so far we have had zero problems (as well as emissions). Never having to stop for gas is a real pleasure - we just ""fill up"" at home with a few hours of charging and the next morning we have a ""full tank"". Someone once said, ""If you can't afford a Tesla don't drive one, it will ruin your life. :) Highly recommended.

tesla,model-s,2017,DT, 05/07/2017,NO LOOKING BACK,5,"I looked at everything. Went to Mercedes, BMW, Audi, VW, Volvo,etc. They really live in the 20th century. While I gave them a chance, all dressed in suits and ties in their fancy showrooms, they really don't want to give you the time of day if you don't want to drop 50k or more on a fossil fuel burner. They put down the Tesla where ever you go, but after asking them, none of them have ever gotten of their butts to even test one.well I tested model S's over 3 years. Right now, I can't afford to buy this car, so it's the only reason why I'm not in it . It would be really nice if you could drive one for a weekend. The salesmen don't push you at all. There is such an excitement among the people, buyers, and customers in the showroom. We went for a long test ride, and it's just phenomenal. The car will actually back into a space too. It takes a while to get used to, but after 3 tests I realized how things worked, and even though I hate touch screens, they showed me how to turn it off during driving. I actually over the years wrote Elon Musk to change a few things, and 3 ideas I thought of actually happened. Imagine me writing GM in the 1970's to put a 2 liter engine with a turbo in their cars, and 40 years later Saab helped them, after they killed Saab. So, after the test is the let down. You have to get back in your car where the engine was invented over 100 years ago. It's sad. You feel like you are getting into a horse and buggy. So now GM will build 10 electric cars in China, but Tesla, the worlds greatest American car can't be sold in 5 states including Connecticut. But we are allowed to have nuclear subs made in CT. Back to the test. What the other car dealers try to scare you, they don't know the Tesla will guide your trip through the charging stations for free, and so what if you have to stop for 20 minutes. Wouldn't you stop in a gas car every 300 miles to take a pee? So forget about the new auto systems on the car. Get it without now, it's cheaper. You can add them on later when the bugs are worked out. But it's hard to consider another car after testing this car. Image a guy coming from South Africa , Elon Musk, and building the best car in our country. That's the American dream. Support this company. We are on top again with this product. If you can't afford it, look for the model 3 to come later this year. There are around 400,000 orders in for this for about 38,000 dollars.and to conclude, I worked for the oil industry for years, I saw the pollution, and while we do need oil for planes, and plastics, but not for cars much longer.

tesla,model-s,2017,Don Lathrop, 01/09/2018,Impossible to compare to other cars,5,"I read some of these other reviews on Edmunds. Some people miss the point. Comparing my Tesla S100D to a Mercedes or BMW is like comparing a horse to a bicycle. It makes no sense to me. I have owned expensive cars from all those companies. Since driving off in my Tesla I hope I never have to listen to a turbo, dual clutch, 9 speed, piston driven ANYTHING ever again. Period. To me, that would be like going back to a '52 Edsel. Electric is better than any of that. There is no ICE that is as smooth. Spare me the ""Interior wasn't quite up to the standards of $100k car"" lines - my white (vegan) leather interior is gorgeous. I will take the Tesla over anything offered on any other car lot because it is the best electric car on the market. With solar panels on my roof I pass the gas station and laugh at the electric company. When I tromp on the skinny pedal I have no guilt because I didn't just burn a half gallon of gas for a little thrill. It's all good. With all-wheel drive I can drive slick roads without a single worry about grip, it holds on like glue. What about the life-span of the vehicle? Nobody wants a 4 year old BMW with 50k miles because there are a million parts that can wear out or break and they cost a fortune to replace. That's why the resale sucks. Tesla's resale is superior because there are a fraction of the parts to go wrong. They estimate the battery pack will still have 80% or more of its power over 300k miles. Simpler can be better, and in this case it is. As I stated, you can't compare an electric car to one with pistons and transmissions and a tailpipe. Electric is better and it has nothing to do with overly complex luxury cars trying to stack up to what an electric car does best: Go fast smoothly and effeciently. Porche can't match Tesla's low center of gravity, not at any price. Rolls Royce can't make a smoother engine. Toyota can't make a piston car as energy efficient. Cadillac can't make a car quieter. THAT is why I love my Tesla and I don't find it comparable to other $100k luxury sedans. I will consider them in the future when they offer me something without the archaic pistons.

Living outside of Detroit, I expected people to be upset that I didn’t get something from GM, Ford or Chrysler. This car is unbelievable and I tell people about it all the time. Last year, I had a 60D and someone hit me driving at 45 mph. The car is a tank, I walked out of my car without any injury. There was some damage to the car of course but wouldn’t get a different car. It amazes me every time I sit in it. There are constant updates to make things better. It’s performance is great. My husband will smile when he hops in to take it out instead of his truck.

tesla,model-s,2017,Matt, 08/29/2019,MOST AMAZING CAR I'VE EVER DRIVEN OR OWNED,5,"The Tesla Model S is an ingenious work of art. I have heard Model 3 owners and Model X owners also rave about their vehicles, but have yet to drive either. Having driven or owned an Audi A7, Porsche Panamera, an M5 BMW, and Mercedes S500, I can tell you that none of these ICE vehicles hold a candle to the Model S in performance (acceleration and cornering on winding roads) and especially, reliability (although the Audi was pretty reliable). I have put 51,000 miles on my Model S (in 2 years) and would absolutely never consider going back to an ICE vehicle. I get well over the gas equivalent of 100 mpg and supercharging (for the Model S and X) on road trips, is FREE. I plug my vehicle in at night, and it's charged and ready to go the next morning. You do need to install a NEMA 14-50 (220 v) plug in your garage/driveway, but that can be done easily by an electrician. Mine charges at about 23 mph (so that gives me over 200 miles of charge in 10 hours). My cost is about $1 for 200+ miles of charge, but I have solar panels. Before the panels, and in the winter when it's overcast, I'd estimate that it costed/costs about $4 per 200 miles of charge. I would say that Tesla has changed the way people think about electric cars 40 years ahead of its time. Tesla has also given away it's technology (by removing patents) for the greater good of our planet. I think that anyone who has the means to spend $50k on a car and does so without test driving a Tesla (or at least an electric car), is making a huge mistake. It's easy for ""us"" (baby boomers, Gen Xers) to go out and buy ICE vehicles without any regard for our planet, as the global warming problem may not affect us directly with that large of an impact. BUT, it will affect our kids and certainly their kids, but that's their problem, right? YOU should MAKE it YOUR problem too. Just TRY IT, YOU'll LIKE IT.  I would also like to add some comments about road trips in the Model S 100D. I've taken several 5-8 hour trips (mainly from Asheville,NC to DC and the panhandle of of Florida) without a charging issue. By the 4th hour of driving (I'm a 54yo male), especially if drinking coffee, I'm ready for a break. We plan our road trips to start by 8 (after breakfast), usually get on the road by 9 and stop for lunch between 1230 and 2 pm, depending on the location of the supercharger. Yes, we have to STOP for 30 minutes to charge, but in doing so, we allow ourselves time to sit and eat at a restaurant and relax a bit. My one recommendation to Tesla for their next 1000 superchargers is to put them near (within 1/4 mile walk) of a GOOD restaurant. There are usually a handful, or at least one decent place to eat near them, which is OK for a road trip, but it would be nice to have something a bit nicer. Having weighed in on all of these factors: IF you are spending $50k on ICE vehicles, I feel you owe it to yourself, your kids, and your kids kids to at least test drive an electric vehicle and my vote is to make one of those test drives, a Tesla.

tesla,model-s,2017,jim long, 05/09/2018,"""Range Anxiety"" is the rule of the day",4,"My wife and I loved everything about this car except for the gross overestimation by Tesla regarding the range that it would achieve on a full charge.  That range did not even come close to the estimation of 335 miles that Tesla advertised.  We were barely able to make a round trip between New York City and Philadelphia which is a little over 200 miles.  And if the remaining available power was in the area of 10% at the end of our trip, it would take 12 hours or more to fully recharge the battery with our home unit.  After owning the car for four months, we were forced to sell it at a significant loss primarily because of my wife's fear that she would run out of power and become stranded.  If you do not do a lot of high speed, open road driving such as on turnpikes and parkways, this would be a great car for you.  It's performance is like nothing else I have ever experienced, including the Porsche 911 that I own.  But if you drive distances, and especially if you like to put the pedal down which this car practically begs you to do, my advice is to STAY AWAY.

tesla,model-s,2017,DAYNE MYERS, 05/15/2019,Best. Car. Ever.,5,"The Tesla Model S is the iPhone of cars - a revolutionary product.  Like an iPhone, it’s expensive but worth every penny. Advanced technology, super quiet, and awesome acceleration and performance.  As an electric car, there’s very little maintenance (no oil changes, for example). You don’t realize what a true game changer this is until you have one.  Another review claimed charging is difficult and supercharger don’t work. I have had the opposite experience - charging is easy, and I appreciate not needing to stop at gas stations anymore. I’ve also driven numerous times between SF and LA and never found a single supercharger out of order in the three years I’ve had my S. In sum, it’s not just the best car I ever had, it’s one of the best products I’ve ever had.

tesla,model-s,2017,Dan F, 07/12/2017,Overpriced gadget,2,"This car was so different from anything else I drove in the past that I had to have it. It accelerates effortlessly. It's quiet. It's comfortable. It feels like a spaceship inside. It has that wow factor. But after only a few weeks of driving it, a lot of the novelty has worn off and now I'm not sure it was worth the hefty price. Tesla has done an outstanding job of taking all of the gas savings you get from an electric car and all of the government tax incentives and including them in the MSRP. So you end up paying all of those savings upfront to Tesla. You also need to plan to pay for an EV charger in your home or somehow have one available. I also quickly learned that the 259 EPA rated range doesn't apply if you want to have fun driving the car. You are also only supposed to charge the car to 90% or lower unless you want to ruin the battery long term. How does it drive? The acceleration is really fun, but it's a very heavy large car that drives like one. The handling and steering are unimpressive compared to a BMW or Porsche that you can buy in this price range. Don't get me wrong. It's a great car. But you are paying a king's ransom for it and if I had to do it over again I would spend more time considering the alternatives rather than being awestruck by my initial Tesla test drive. Keep in mind also that Tesla can introduce a massive change to your car the day after you take delivery so resale value in a few years or even after a few weeks will be terrible.

Just in 6 months the problems started with the mechanical and electronics.they were addressed several times and the service did not take care of them. They rather reply you back telling “we have not seen it. “ Meaning you are lying. The issue still exists. I have a maintenance plan but the vehicle was never taken care correctly. I had the issue with the central console right from the first service and was never adresssed. Finally it shut down excately after my 4 the service and now they say I have to pay for it because I am out of warrenty. They make you pay for the service and maintenance plans but the service is not at all justified. I have spend $150K on the care so far. It’s great as long as it runs with no issue. But running with no issues is impossible. I might spend so much on the care to drive it for 8+ years and now driving it for 2 years had been literally miserable. My order for Model 3 is in progress and now I am cancelling them also. I feel bad that I have referee many of my friends and now they have the same bad experience. The cost and maintenance of my P90D is more that BMW 7 series and Mercedes S Class. This is spending more money rather that saving. This review is coming after I have talked to several owners. The car was behaving weird and I was scared to drive it after after a week of my recent service.i had it in drive mode and it just reversed and hit the garage. The console was shut down and Tesla says they see that I reversed and hit the garage. This car is not reliable and not safe at all when it malfunctions like this.

tesla,model-s,2017,MattB, 10/16/2020,Most Amazing Car I've ever owned!,5,"I purchased the 2017 Tesla Model S 100D in Nov 2017. I got a ""deal"" and paid only $94k, saving about 7k because it was a demo with  3400 miles on it. The rated miles per charge was 330 when I bought it and I could go somewhere in the 315 range, if I didn't drive it hard. I have driven it hard for the past 3 years, putting over 70,000 miles on it. The same car, now with a rating of 402 miles, is now UNDER $70k! Incredible! Anyone who is going to spend $70k or more on a BMW, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche, or other performance sedan needs to look at Tesla. the only maintenance I have done is 3 sets of tires (like I said, I drive it hard), and 2 sets of windshield wiper blades. That is it. It's electric and a blast to drive. Mine is 0-60 in 4.1 seconds, which is plenty fast...but where it really excels is going from 40-70 (onramps)..instantaneous torque and power! If you are driving on winding roads frequently, like I do, I would consider the Model 3, just because it's more nimble on curves. You give up some long  distance comfort, but it's also about 20k less (nicely equipped at $50k). I have driven the model 3 (Turo rental) for a week and loved how it handles...almost 911 Porshe-like in it's handling. Just a fantastic car company...and , oh yea, it's American!

Put charger in garage and at ranch, and really only need to charge once a week. Sure am glad that I will never go to a stinky gas station again and risk being mugged, and raped for premium gas that would be needed to run a car that had anything close to this performance.

tesla,model-s,2018,Chris, 03/18/2019,Love it and hate it!,3,"Tesla is a great car with industry changing features. The technology is great but it is definitely not a full self driving car but a supercharged cruise control. Still much better than most any car out there. Having and electric car with no gas fill is great but don't be fooled by the advertised range. You will not get close to it unless you keep it under 35 mph and in 70 degree weather. Sales process was horrible for me. I was expecting a new car with all the advertised features but received an older version with a lot of features missing including satellite radio, heating steering wheel, etc. Tesla gave me some free perks to try to make up for it but when you pay this much for a car you expect to get what was advertised. Car also came with a defective wind shield. After replacing it and spending about 30 days in service over the last 5 months I'm still having rattling noises. Car also makes a grumbling noise when you floor the accelerator. Tesla says this is normal and there is no fix for it. One of the top features of this car is the acceleration. Too bad it sounds like it's going to fall apart when you floor it. Service is horrible compared to Audi. You make an appointment on-line (no one to talk to), when you bring in your car it sits for 3 days before any one works on it, when you call the service department no one answers your call, car comes back dirty and seems no one test drives the car after service has been performed.

Software is what will make a car unique, adaptable and eventually affordable. That Tesla can upgrade my software regularly means that model year of the car no longer has the same relevance it has for the legacy companies. Granted new battery technology might emerge but otherwise there is not much mechanical innovation on the Tesla horizon. We all wait for the 9.0 OS not a new engine or braking system or all the many gadgets that we used to get in our BMWs - half of which we never used.  Once you understand your car (and your car understands you), it is like a relationship with you computer only it takes you places. What is particularly cool is that for this particular moment in time the realization that you are in the most technologically advanced automobile in the world. I realize that this will inevitably change but for this moment that is the truth - not the most expensive automobile but the most advanced.

There is something for everyone in this car.  It’s fast, clean, classy, high tech, and it drives itself.  I have not owned my car long enough to speak to reliability but so far so good.  Customer service (Springfield NJ) has been excellent.  The Model S is pricey (even with incentives applied) but never buyer’s remorse.   In fact, every time I drive this car I am amazed by how much technology is at my fingertips.  Autopilot is by far my favorite feature.  The ability of the car to park itself into the garage is a major convenience.  My garage is tight.  Seeing the car perfectly position itself between walls and columns is impressive to say the least.  As much as I love the 75D, there is room for improvement.  Tesla needs to refine the operation of the Fronk door.  No need to simulate a classic car hood.  It’s a storage area not an engine compartment.  As it stands, the Fronk is not set up for high volume use.  The lack of Apple Car Play is a disappointment.  And although the bright white seats are a highlight (stunning in fact), the seats in form, control, and sophistication lag most high-end luxury cars.  In short, the value of this car is far greater than the cost.  Elon Musk created something very special with the Model S and the 2018 Model demonstrates Tesla’s commitment to excellence.  "
tesla,model-s,2018,Brian L-C, 03/18/2019,Smartphone on tires,4,"The acceleration is wickedly fun. Autopilot is hugely convenient in stop and go highway traffic. Where you live relative to superchargers and service centers could influence whether this is a good purchase. Besides the very occasional glitchy software function, or mechanical part function (for which there are few), there is almost no maintenance required. I would have gone just for an oil change 4 or 5 times in a year driving over 30k miles. I had just one routine check for the Tesla in a year. In temperatures below freezing the battery range falls dramatically. I use about 160 miles of range to travel 100 miles when the temp is down around 10 degrees. The cabin also gets very hot on sunny, hot days. Automatic temp features will keep the cabin under 103 when you're not using it (which will impact battery). As I never travel more than 130 miles/day for work, range is never an issue. Vehicle inspections are interesting. Most garage attendants have not inspected a Tesla before. Be prepared to walk them through every check they need to make. If they want to see under the car, inform them of the jack function and weight of the car.

tesla,model-s,2018,BLC, 12/02/2018,Buyer's remorse?,5,"No...I love the car. I went from a BMW 3 series xDrive to this, and the driving experience in the Tesla has been phenomenal. The OTA updates since March 2018, when I got the car, have only made the experience better. The features in today's Teslas will become common, and then outdated, in the near future, but that's just how things generally go.  Charging will get faster. Methods of charging will change. Fuel types will change. But you got to jump in some time. The current autopilot eases long commutes. Frustrating stop and go traffic isn't as frustrating because work tasks like checking emails, organizing schedules, and taking notes are possible. The car handles well in all weather conditions (wet, dry, deep snow).

The self driving capabilities relieve the burden and increase of the safety. The giant touch screen is very pleasing it convenient. Being able to pull into my garage and plug in rather than touching snotty gas candles has been my favorite.  I have never had to have it serviced. No oil changes. No engine to dips. Unlike the Boxee electric cars of the past this car is very sporty and a beauty to look at.

tesla,model-s,2018,drj, 02/17/2018,Terrible customer service,3,"I’ve had a tesla for almost a year. It had several problems that where fixed. Yesterday my rear tire was punctured with an object on the road. 
I called Tesla roadside and my car was transported to the service center. 
I called early to make sure I had my car back on the same day  
Unfortunately there where NO spare tire or inventory tires in stock. Then there where NO tesla loaners cars. 
For a 100k+ vehicle that doesn’t come with a spare tire the support is ridiculous and unacceptable. 
I’m left without a car for a problem that could be resolved in 5 minutes with a spare tire. I had a full day a Patients to see at different hospitals and had to cancel on them because I had no reliable transportation. 
I called management and I’m still waiting for a call back. 
I love the car, but I’m done with customer service. Last tesla I will buy.

tesla,model-s,2018,Dave LV, 12/18/2018,Musk is not a car lover and it shows,3,"Musk doesn’t want drivers but rather only passengers in self driving vehicles. He misses that a whole lot of us like to drive. Teslas lack: heads up displays, ventilated and massaging seats, door pockets, interior bling, leather, customizing design options, performance data recorders.  And unlike competitors Jaguar and Audi, going off road in a Tesla voids the warranty.  Teslas are more kit car-ish than real luxury.  And not to have satellite radio even as an option in the Model 3 just shows Musk and his team have never driven across country where there is no cellular service along long parts of highway.   Teslas are great for California but lack depth for most of the country.  Hopefully a major update will address the many flaws."
tesla,model-s,2018,Mitch98, 09/13/2019,The Future has arrived and it’s Awesome!,5,"I have owned many luxury sports cars - Audi, bmw, Lexus and Porsche and simply got tired of sitting in traffic getting 17 mpg, breathing in fumes when the window was rolled down or worrying about whether my kids would ever survive the global warming I was contributing to with my gas guzzling sports car. My next car was slated to be a 911 or A8. I decided to “rebel” and take a risk on this car. The Model S has exceeded all my expectations. Yes, those other brands are nicer inside, but you quickly adapt to the Tesla interior and it rapidly becomes very comfortable and pleasant. The performance is simply extraordinary- super car fast. The fact that I can drive it all week and plug it in at home whenever I feel like - never stop at a gas station again? No oil changes or maintenance? No more tail pipe emissions? I simply love this car and never tire of it after 10 months of ownership. Tesla simply has a massive technological advance and until others catch up, this is the only choice for me. Make the leap to an electric car and really enjoy the difference. To me it’s a similar leap as when we went from Old Cathode Ray Tubes (TVs) to LCDs or fro. Flip phones to IPhones/Smartphones. It’s just extremely unlikely you’ll regret the decision and miss your old car!

God help you when you call the dealer for service; expect to be put on hold for an hour.  If you schedule on line, they never respond to your emails.  I have never seen service this horrible for a car over $100K.  I tried to call and email dealer general manager and he could care less.

tesla,model-s,2018,Jeff Jones, 10/04/2020,Can’t wait to buy another one!,5,"I only have one regret regarding my my purchase of the Model S 75D, range. I should have purchased the 100D. For 99% of my driving the range of the 75D is way more than adequate. But for a 300-400 mile road trip, which is the maximum that I would ever drive in a single day, the 402 mile range “long range plus” is what I would like to own. I have driven the car for 18 months and 18,000 miles and have had no service issues with the car. I do have to say that customer service is quite lacking when one would like to simply call and ask a few questions about features or things going on with the car. The car has amazing amount of room for carrying cargo and passengers. I no longer take my wife’s SUV to Costco or Home Depot anymore. The ride, acceleration and seat comfort is spectacular. Charging at home is very cheap, maybe adds $30-$40 to my electric bill to drive 1000 miles a month. The convenience of charging at home is amazing. I surely do not miss driving to a gas station to fill up. Supercharging on the road is way cheaper than the cost of gas and only requires minor adjustments to your trip. The time saved over the course of a year not having to make special trips to the gas stations more than makes up for a little extra time on a road trip. I would like to see the option of real leather interior but to tell the truth most people think it is real leather until I t

The cars technology continues to be updated every couple of months... automatically like an iPhone. I have had the car 18 months and it hasn’t needed any servicing. Life without gas stations is wonderful! I charge the car in my garage and it charges within five or six hours. The stated mileage is very accurate, I get about 300 miles while driving 10 above speed limit. Super chargers are able to charge the car from near empty to 336 miles in about about an hour and 20 minutes. This is not a car for a long road trip, too much trouble lining up super chargers, but great for any under 300 miles.

tesla,model-s,2019,R Woodward, 07/16/2019,S - The absolute best car we've ever owned.,5,"We had a 17 S 90 D for 2 years and it only needed service once. Tesla came to our home (rural area) and promptly fixed it under warranty. No other problems. Loved the car. Fun to drive - a completely different world of driving from a gas car. 
Now have a 19 performance L and REALLY love this car. Blistering acceleration when needed, no gas/oil changes and absolutely no problems with Tesla service or getting questions answered. Best navigation we have ever had - simply tell it where you want to go (take me to the bowling alley - drive me to the nearest Chic-fil-A, take me to Myrtle beach, etc.). On trips the navigation guides you from one super charger to another, gives you sufficient charge to get to the next one with reserve and sends you on your way (saving time). All super charges we have ever visited have worked flawlessly. This car gets the equivalent of over 100 mpg so our fuel bill is roughly 1/4 what it would be in a gas car. Offsets much of the premium price of the car. Great audio and on the x-way it really does drive itself. I fully agree with the previous poster - I am completely spoiled - could never go back to an ICE car.
"
tesla,model-s,2019,Andrei Gasic, 11/28/2019,Best car ever!,5,"Let me preface by saying that my 2020 model S long range vehicle is my third Tesla. I traded in my 2016 Tesla model S (built with new facia August 2016).  My odometer was at approximately 46,000 miles. The car went to the shop once in the entire time that I owned it, replaced front rotors that became warped (probably from my rapid stopping).  I have a 47 AMP 220 V charging station at my home. I commute every day 80 to 100 miles round-trip. Over a three-year period my battery degraded 3%. So when it came time to upgrade to a 2020 model (Built November 2019) I knew exactly what I wanted. My long range vehicle achieves 370 miles versus my old model S 75D which had approximately 250 mile range.  I purchased a vehicle with white interior and blue exterior. The wheels were 19 inch carbon color(a must!).  I have driven almost 1000 miles miles on my vehicle thus far.  

Now comes the fun part. The 2020 model is a vastly different vehicle than the 2016. The acceleration, drive and interior noise has been vastly improved. There have been some upgrades to the interior that improve the overall comfort.  This model is equipped with hardware Version 3.  Driving and handling is absolutely amazing. I can compare this to my previous vehicles which include Porsche turbo Carrera (2015), Boxster S (2014), Mercedes CLS and GLC.  The only vehicle that approaches the driving experience and stability with handling is my Porsche Boxster, a mid engine vehicle.  Tesla benefits from a excellent center of gravity due to a monolithic battery pack that is under the vehicle.  Additionally, a computer controlled air suspension system provides handling beyond the reach of any vehicle I have ever driven.  Compared to an internal combustion engine, this vehicle is clean, amazingly reliable and potentially could be the last vehicle many people would want to own.   My old Tesla though I say I traded it in, went to a good friend of mine at the trade-in price.  After three years of use the vehicle had lost approximately 30% of its value. Very few top end luxury cars will retain this kind of value.  At almost 50,000 miles the car was barely broken in. My desire to trade up had more to do with technology.  

Auto pilot on the 2020 model has yet to achieve its full potential, but is a significant improvement from my 2016 model. I can’t imagine driving a vehicle without auto pilot on a daily hundred mile round-trip commute. I return home every day refreshed.  I am able to operate the vehicle all the while being able to conduct business calls, which as a high acuity physician working out of a level one trauma hospital center is a must.  

Finally, range-anxiety is a syndrome only applicable to people who own electric vehicles. I must say, my 2016 model S with 250 mile range did provoke some low-level anxiety on long trips.  However, with the long range version this has dissipated completely. I have never had any issue at any supercharging station on long trips. With a vehicle that now achieves close to 400 miles on a single charge, charging at a supercharger station is faster than before.  

I must agree with some of the other comments regarding frustration level when purchasing the vehicle and trying to reach customer service at any given Tesla store or repair center. However, I must say that this is the most responsive Company when it comes to servicing your vehicle. My Tesla app allows me to make an appointment almost seamlessly. For minor issues Tesla will send a mobile repair person to your home or work. They are able to do the majority of the common issues on their mobile unit. No other car manufacturer offers this type of service.  

I will never purchase another internal combustion engine vehicle and will remain a loyal Tesla customer because they are currently the leader in the electric vehicle technology and experience.

Seven months into my ownership I have
 racked up 8000 miles. The vehicle has performed flawlessly. I have had no mechanical issues. Several software upgrades later I am enjoying the entertainment center it provides. I now have Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services I can use when the vehicle is idle at charging stations or having prolonged waits. Additionally, the vehicle now recognizes stop signs, stop lights and other signs. Auto pilot continues to improve. It is getting closer to autonomous level.  I have experienced approximately 2–3% battery degradation, which is expected in the first 4-6 months. Overall, the range is exceptional.  Compared to my 2016 model S, this is a technologically vast improvement.

We still have the 85, at 85,000 miles now, and we have a Model 3 Performance.  It's very difficult to consider going back to any other car brand - BMWs before.  The acceleration is a blast!

tesla,model-s,2019,Drew-NY, 12/24/2019,Model S P100D,5,"I recently traded a 2017 Porsche for a Model S P100D and I can honestly say that I've never loved a car more than my P100D. This is my first EV and the driving experience is on another level. It's my favorite car so far and I've owned many fast cars in the past 20 years, including: a Porsche 911 Carrera S, 911 Turbo, Cayenne Turbo, Macan Turbo, Acura NSX, 2 BMW M5, BMW 650 Gran Coupe, Callaway Corvette, Audi S8, MB CL600, ML63, E63, CLS 63, and an Acura NSX (most had ECU tunes). So a year ago, I never even thought about buying an EV until the day I went to lunch with a client in his Tesla Model S. I was totally speechless and I couldn't stop thinking about that car in the days/weeks ahead. Long story short, I traded my Macan Turbo which I owned for less than a year for a P100D. Tesla's offer for my Macan was pretty low but I was told they would match a Carmax offer. I went to Carmax, they offered me $2,000 more, and Tesla matched their offer. The process was a little time consuming and annoying to be honest. Some of the things written by other reviewers in regard to Tesla sales people not returning calls right away etc are  true. So was the overall experience a little annoying? Yes..... Did I take a big hit on my Macan trade? Yes..... but when all said and done, was it worth it? Absolutely 100% YES and I have no regrets. I've been a car guy my entire life and I love my Model S more than any other car I've owned. People that know me, all agree I tell it how it is. If I hated the car, I'd have no problem saying it. 
Btw, I am 100% convinced without a doubt that 1 or 2 of the Model S reviews on here are not real reviews by an actual owner of a Model S. Probably written by a Tesla hater (or maybe written by a confused Tesla short-seller who has been getting mauled lately).

tesla,model-s,2019,CCharlie, 10/23/2019,Horrible Purchasing Experience - Do NOT recommend,1,"UPDATE: I was driving my (brand new) Tesla Model S on the highway. As soon as I got on an off-ramp, I heard a very loud screeching/grinding noise. I pulled over, and there was a large metal piece hanging from the bottom of my car. I eventually brought my car into the shop. They said that there is no evidence that I bottomed-out or hit anything. INSTEAD, I was informed that Tesla failed to properly attach a large piece of steel to the bottom of the car. They said either screws were missing or loose. I've only had this car for a few weeks and this is another ridiculous issue.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: The purchasing process was unprofessional and frustrating. Here are some examples of what occurred:
(1) A Tesla representative informed me that Tesla matches CarMax appraisals. However, despite having a CarMax appraisal, I was required to provide two more appraisals from CarMax in order for Tesla to match the trade-in value offered by CarMax (resulting in three appraisals total). This resulted in hours of phone calls (with both CarMax and Tesla) in addition to multiple trips to CarMax locations, which forced me to miss a lot of time at work.
(2) I asked many questions about Autopilot during the purchasing process. I also received documentation on Autopilot versions and features to make sure I understood what I was purchasing. Despite this, the features I received are subpar and I was expecting to receive many more features. (The version of Autopilot in my Model S is basically a glorified version of cruise control. It defeats the purpose of buying a Tesla.) I am incredibly disappointed in Tesla's practices of periodically repackaging Autopilot features with minimal to no visibility on the buyer's side. The documents I received describing Autopilot are very unclear and the conversations with Tesla representatives did not provide adequate clarity.
(3) My Model S arrived with a damaged door. I now have to take more time off work to make an appointment and get it repaired.
(4) My spare key does not work. It is unclear if they gave my spare key to the wrong customer. This is very disconcerting and I do not feel comfortable keeping valuables in my own car.
(5) When I contacted Tesla representatives about the above issues, I was ignored for multiple days and had to follow-up numerous times with different representatives in order to get an answer. The answer I finally received was along the lines of ""Sorry. Make a service appointment through the App."" It should not take a week for me to receive a basic answer like that. I also would've expected the Tesla team to be more accommodating considering how difficult this entire experience has been.

tesla,model-s,2019,Google Review, 12/01/2019,Comparable to a 1980's domestic...,1,"There is a lot of hype about Tesla.  Had my expectations been lower, I may not have been as sorely disappointed.

The body panels do not match or line up.  They aren't flush, and the gaps vary.  They appear to have been put on without any attention to detail.  The wheels sit irregularly in the wheel wells, like a cheap rebody.

The interior is gloomy, but the first thing that happens as you fall into the interior, is you hit your head.  The door sill is very high, but the bar for the roof is very low.  The interior panels also do not match each other, or the exterior.  The cheaply-made interior is covered in suede and plastic.  The gaps are uneven, and the panels appear to be warped.

The seat is maybe sized for a child, but certainly not an adult.  The sides of the seat dig into my back.  The safety belt buckle is in a hole that is difficult to reach.  It would be nice if the seat moved back another few inches.

The sun burns my head through the glass roof.

The Tesla drives like a boat, and parks like a bus.  The backup camera is useless.

The carputer rebooted numerous times, while I waited, and waited.  Waiting is a Tesla theme.  The carputer is very, very, very slow.  The spinning circle is the only thing you get, for 10 or more minutes, whenever you press something on the screen.  Speaking of which, although the screen is large, the icons are tiny, and counter-intuitive.  The ride height adjustment is erratic.  While the computer is rebooting, no backup ride height adjustment, so you have to wait for 2 reboots, to raise the height to pull into your driveway.  The side mirrors are useless.  When you back up, they adjust themselves, and do not adjust back.

The map would not move as I drove, so I drove off the map.

Everything you want to do must be done through endless menus.  The mrnus are scrambled, so you have to press one after another, waiting and waiting for the carputer.

Cruise control would not work.

Braking is poor, compared to modern beaking, but on par with braking 20 years ago.

The screen is too far away to resch.  As large as the dcreen is, the tiny icons could be larger.

The B-pillar blocks my peripheral vision.

On exit, there is an elbow-gouger on the B-pillar.  Ouch!  It is nearly impossible yo extricate yourself from the car, unaided, because you have to put your legs up over the sill, then try to squeeze between the wheel and the seat.

The Tesla died on the highway.  No power, nothing.  Apparently, this just happens.  Tesla didn't seem worried about this hazard.

It does have good acceleration, from 0-10 MPH.  After 10 MPH, it's about on par with a 1969 TransAm.

To sum it up, the Tesla is a cheaply-made, poorly-designed road hazard.

tesla,model-x,2016,Travis W, 10/24/2016,"Amazing EV, but Quality & Longevity Are Questioned",3,"Purchased an X in September 2016, coming out of a Model S.  The X is more comfortable overall, easier to get in/out of, ride height is better if you like that over a shorter car, etc.  The interior is nice, comfortable, and luxurious, but not as fit and finished as other luxury brands on materials (Audi, BMW, Mercedes) - just not quite there yet.  The car looks great overall on exterior and the large amounts of chrome do get dirty easily, etc.  Decent amount of black molding on car but improvements appearance overall.  On quality, ours was delivered with a number of misalignment of panels, doors, and the rear hatch was so bad it had to be disassembled and then replaced to be aligned well.  We've had a couple seals the protrude and also severe wind noise from the frameless windows and their seal design a few times.  Our car was delivered with an unbolted loose rocking/squeaking driver seat which was unacceptable and fixed.  Service with Tesla is very good but is getting less responsive as more cars are produced and on the road.  We do also have a few paint issues that are appearing on rear of car and will need to address potentially.  Overall, Tesla quality isn't quite there just yet compared to some luxury brands as these issues seem common on many of the Xs out there - but perhaps some new builds are improving as ours was a VIN 8000ish.  Having said all that, the car is awesome, drives wonderful, is faster than you need (even as a regular 90D), range is great 99.9% of the time more than you need, and the technology in the car is leagues above other cars as well as just easy to use due to lack of oddly labeled buttons, knobs, etc.  The X is an expensive car but saving on gas, the overall utility of it, and comfort do put it up there with other luxury SUVs that are not far off.  Our main concern is the quality (mostly resolved now) and longevity that goes along with that.  The first 4 years of warranty will be valuable it seems, and Tesla hasn't offered an extended 4 years just yet (but probably will at a cost soon).  After 8 years though, will have to see how well the car is holding up, FWDs holding up, etc.

tesla,model-x,2016,Patrick, 01/27/2017,Reviews seem fake. See for yourself.,5,"Took delivery a few weeks ago prepared for misaligned body panels, falcon wing doors that wouldn't work, and poor service. That's what you would expect reading all these reviews. I have had a great delivery experience without any car issues and now I have most incredible car I have ever been in let alone owned. I have two kids in car seats and I can tell you Elon's ""over engineered"" pain with the falcon wing doors is my gain. Makes me smile every time I place my kids in their seats thinking of all the times I had to tilt their bodies, squeeze through narrow door openings, and bump their heads on the ceiling while straining my back to get them in my sedan. When my wife is driving the kids I feel safe knowing they are in one of the safest vehicles on the road. The serenity of driving without engine noise will blow your mind. Other favorite features: enormous windscreen, touchscreen controls that make every other car seem 10 years out of date, waking up with a ""full tank"" every morning and therefore never having to stand out in the cold and pump gas, warming up car with the app. Only downside so far: I have to drive my gas car when my wife takes the kids.

Update:
Two years later after purchase remain very happy with my decision. In fact, I do not plan to ever buy another gas car again. Have had a Model 3 for about 6 months so I no longer have to drive a gas car to work :) . Convinced electric is the future (and its a better future), but not many people know it or can afford it yet. One of the falcon wing doors developed a brief squeak during opening or closing that Tesla service made go away by adjusting the seals. Took our first real road trip to a Great Wolf lodge about 2 hours away. Stopped at a Supercharger for 20 minutes or so and got a cup of coffee and a donut at a bakery nearby. Car was charged up beyond what we needed by the time we returned. Long distance travel takes longer, but is a breeze with the in car app telling you where to charge and for how long. Charging at your destination if there is no supercharger takes some planning, but getting better. Update: They just put in a Supercharger next the Great Wolf Lodge so wouldn't even have to stop (but I probably will as that bakery was too good to pass up ;)  Drove to Chicago in the Model X (~6 hour drive) instead of flying just to do it. Takes longer than in a gas car no doubt, but wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Met some nice people at the Superchargers and did some shopping at Meijer or had a bite to eat at Starbucks or carried out from a local restaurant while waiting on Supercharging. Travel has a different cadence, but I personally don't mind. The car has a bigger battery than my kids bladders anyway at this point.

tesla,model-x,2016,Jules, 10/23/2016,Why I went back to Tesla,5,"After writing a bad review about my first Model X and trading it in on an X5 I ended up going back to a newer Model X. I think they have improved quality a lot since my first Model X and I love it. I cannot go back to a gas car anytime soon. Now, in Pennsylvania road trips can be a bit time consuming and you have to plan out your trips more compared to states like California where Superchargers are everywhere, but it's a small price to pay for never having to buy gas again.

tesla,model-x,2016,Chris G., 08/29/2016,Great vehicle for anywhere that isn't hot,2,"I was super excited to drive this car. All the hype and hoopla, the superlatives written in the reviews really sold me. I was ready to buy it just looking at it. I live in Texas and test drove the car at around 10:00 AM. The car had been cooling for 5 minutes before I got in so I was immediately disappointed to get in to an overly warm vehicle. I figured we could crank up the A/C and we would be set, no big deal. The only problem was it had already been set to its highest setting. It just could not keep up with the August morning heat in Texas. Read that again. The morning heat. If this vehicle had been sitting in the sun all afternoon it would be unbearable. Actually, it would be nightmarish to me knowing that it would not cool off. To be fair, the car got comfortable at the end of my test drive 30 minutes later. It looks as if they put the same small vents from the Model S in the X which doesn't make sense. If you have a larger volume of area, you need a larger volume of air. Other than this one glaring issue, the car really seemed perfect. I loved the acceleration, the handling, and the interior was amazing. The windshield/panoramic roof is phenomenal. I have children and the second row seats that can slide and tilt forward for third row access was great also.

tesla,model-x,2016,DRD, 12/22/2016,Too many problems and poor service,1,"I really love the concept of a car built by a start-up from the ground up. However, I am not happy that I spent so much money for a car that has had so many issues plus a service center that schedules repairs 3-weeks out. I am getting used to my Enterprise Ford rental while I wait weeks for backordered parts. I would turn my car in for a full refund if I could.
"
tesla,model-x,2016,L P, 08/30/2016,not sure if worth the money,1,"We loved Tesla Model X when we test drove it.  The sales girl told us that the car would be ready in 2 month.  We ordered it!  when delivery specialist contacted us after that, he said that actually the car will be ready in October.  We said -OK, what can you do?  2 month later we got a call the the car is ready, (2 month earlier then promised),   we must come and accept delivery for it.  The time slots for delivery appointments are limited, and so we have to adjust out busy schedule to receive the car.  We have scramble to get loan-since we were told that we had 2 extra month before, also the charger is not installed, so that becoming  a pain. The car drove fine, fast p90d with ludicrous mode, comfy however; it started to fall apart on day 2-little parts on inside (decorative) things started to fall off.  The on day 5 the car shut down, with all warning lights on, and we took it back to service.  That's where the crappy service began.  First we could not get hold of the service person, -he was with other customers.  Now when i get a 160K car -I expect service person available, period!  Then they said that replacement car would come from Enterprise?! who promised me Chevy Impala.  of course i said that will not happen and after discussing this issue with service representative they somehow got fully charged Model S they could loan us.  It has been almost a week and car still not repaired, parts are ordered from somewhere...... no time estimates given.  So after owning Tesla Model X for 2 weeks, I am less then impressed.  I understand that things can malfunction, but lack of service is just that.....

tesla,model-x,2016,Aleksander, 07/28/2016,"What do you get from Tesla when you spend $113,000",3,"First, you will get a whole lot of excitement by watching pictures and videos on the Tesla website, while you are waiting for your car to arrive at the dealer. Then, for the first few weeks, you will think and tell everybody that you have the best car in the world… and then, reality sets in. You start realizing that many of those high tech gizmos simply don’t work. But, you understand, that this is a fresh concept car and you almost expect that. So far so good, but then you are going to get seriously shocked when you try to get through the service department appointment desk and eventually the service manager. 
Honestly, I never, ever, experienced such a bad service in any other cars I have owned, or am currently possessing now, even when the cars were worth a fraction of the $113,000 which I have spent on my Model X 4 months ago. I know that nobody will believe me if I will tell you that today, July 25, I called the Tesla Service Department in Burbank to request another follow up appointment to fix a list of problems (some of them serious safety issues) and was told, that if I was to waive my rights for a loaner car (per my contract) the fastest open appointment is August 25...basically in one month! How many issues does Tesla Model X have for the service department to have to wait for one full month?  It didn’t help to get over my disappointment with the car when I had a very unfriendly and rude conversation with the service manager Mr. Mines. I explained to this gentleman my problems and the reason why I asked for the service manager and I got interrupted with “Are you done yet? May I talk now?” Wow!  
    People! For your information...if I called the Maserati dealership (true story), with any problem, I will have an appointment the next day, and I will drive out in a brand new loaner car. That’s service! 
    I wish I never leased my Tesla Model X, simply because I don’t believe that anybody deserves service and should be treated that way.
"
tesla,model-x,2016,Andrew, 10/20/2016,Wait until quality improves,2,"I purchased this car and am so disappointed with the quality of the build. The 2nd day of ownership the drivers door didn't open. The door latch needed to be replaced. They damaged the door when repairing the latch. Another service call.  The wipers make noise,there is excessive wind noise, road noise, moisture in the rear tail lights and other problems.  There are so many other cars that are more quality and less problems. Forget about getting a service appointment especially if you want a Tesla loaner. That would be well over a months wait.

tesla,model-x,2016,ONEANGRYMO, 05/18/2017,Tesla is changing everything.,5,"I got my Model X delivered Dec 30th to my home at 10:00pm. Probably the most exciting new car purchase I have ever made.  It is fast, smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  Its range is excellent.  It is truly the future of transportation.  I have had only minor issues, Tesla customer service is first class. Much better than my piece of crap BMW x5.  That thing broke down all the time, and the service center locally was a pain to deal with.  I am very happy with my purchase.

1 year later update.  Awesome car. Some minor issues that Tesla swiftly took care of.  Best customer service on the planet. I am still happy with my vehicle. Smooth, quiet, fast, looks great, feels great.
"
tesla,model-x,2016,DFE, 10/27/2016,Not Ready for Prime Time,2,"I ordered a Tesla X in June of 2105.  It arrived in September of 2016.  All of the amazing things it does well have been described by others.  The electronics, sleek profile, lack of engine noise, acceleration, and easy to understand controls are all great.  But its not ready for prime time by a long shot.  The lack of engine noise is totally outweighed by a noisy, choppy, and rattle filled interior.  The tires are incredibly noisy. The suspension is downright awful and cannot be adjusted even with the air suspension option.  Only the ride HEIGHT can be controlled not the stiffness. I bought it for my wife to replace her midsize Mercedes SUV. So that was her baseline.  Her very first reaction upon entering the X was where do things go. The cop holders are awkward to say the least, the storage is minimal, the second row seats do not fold flat, and there is NO PLACE to hang clothes or even lay them flat. A bright sun is bothersome as it shines through the huge windshield and the visors are amusingly toy-like. The rear view mirror is tiny and the rear window small. Unsafe in my book.  The gull wing doors were fun for 15 minutes and then an inconvenient pain. The back seats are small and narrow and all the talk about legroom is just not true in the real world.  In short, it is not a workaday vehicle.

Update at 9000 miles. The vehicle has not gotten better with time. It’s ride is still harsh and the rattles are worse. I learned after one Midwest winter that an electric vehicle range is dramatically affected by temperatures below 40F. The range is reduced by at least 40% as are the regenerative brakes. The heater cannot keep up with the cold. The gull wing doors are especially annoying in rain or snow. I’ve had flat tires and learned they are a bit rare and quite expensive to replace. The local Tesla service center is good.
Three year update: A minor rear end fender bender. Six weeks in shop and $13,000 to repair. Automatic car wash now rips off side running lights.
"
tesla,model-x,2016,Brian K, 08/03/2018,4 years old and still amazed!,5,"We went to Tesla in 2016 to place our $1,000 deposit for a Model 3 but ended up buying this Model X 60D which was not on our radar before we test drove it. Compared to other candidates for replacing my wife's Mercedes GL the X seemed to come from 20 years in the future, In particular we loved the airy cabin with enormous windshield, the silent propulsion, the amazing off-the-line acceleration, and the lack of exhaust emissions. Autopilot 1.0 fairly blew us away. Two years and 35k miles later we still love all those features and we have been very happy with the support and service from Tesla where the repair center still feels like a fun garage with friendly helpful people. Not many downsides. I never liked the falcon wing doors and they are indeed a minor pain especially if someone is getting into the front seat and someone else into the back at the same time. They do however get a lot of oohs and ahhs even now. Build quality is fine, but it does not feel as solid as the best in class Lexus or Mercedes. Supercharging is awesome - I can go anywhere in the country with my puny 60 kWhr battery. Still amazed!
4 year update: Well the car just seems to improve with time. In some ways it has actually improved via over the air updates which keep the user interface fresh and add small useful features. It is also surprising to me to see how little progress the other car makers have made. Not to pick on Mercedes I just know them best, but you need a microscope to distinguish today's GLS from the 2008 GL that my Model X replaced. In other ways the Model X simply has not deteriorated as my Mercedes GL did around this time.  No bills for major maintenance, because all those complex oily bits simply don't exist. I look at my old 'GL maintenance log' in Excel with awe that I spent so much to keep that car in tip top condition. Tesla massively underestimate the savings on their website. The only small surprise is that I seem to use a 12V battery every year, so far at no cost to me. I had previously assumed that the big battery would protect the little one but it seems a lot of the user interface features run on 12V. More than ever this seems like a very smart choice. 
"
tesla,model-x,2016,OG, 12/12/2016,Test Driving a Model X P90D,2,"About the car: aside the electric part (which it is good or the best in itself) the price range with options (100-120 K) that makes Tesla desirable is not competitive with other cars in that range and same style. Cabin is not sealed at 65-70 m/h, tires are noisy too at that speed. Auto Pilot feature is misleading (I am sure it will get better) but just now it is nothing else than a dynamic cruise control.  Acceleration is very sensitive which it is likely to please certain group of people, but it is not practical for an everyday commuting car, making Model X a toy to enjoy and impress friends once in a while. Bottom line: Too much money for a good battery and decently good looking car.
About the service: it is not clear how maintenance would be handled. In case of having the car serviced for a reason different from scheduled maintenance, it seems there is a LONG waiting list to get hands on a dealer loaner. The alternative would be a gas operated car from a rent-a-car company. This is not acceptable, not for that price.
Summary: For more than it is innovative and cute, the model X is not ready to compete in the price range it has being marketed.
Suggestion to consumers: sleep on it until it develops in a better choice. It will for sure!

tesla,model-x,2016,Johny5, 04/21/2017,BEST SUV / Crossover vehicle EVER!,5,"Hello I have owned my 2017 Tesla model X 90D for 22 days I have over 4000+ miles on it already and driven every terrain except for snow.  This vehicle continues to impress and outperforms all other competition (Including my neighbors Lamborghini Gallardo!!!!) I have had zero problems locating superchargers along my route which are totally free! I thought having this car in my apartment on the beach would be a problem but it's totally not since I only have to charge it every other few days and charging is pretty quick. I have autopilot version 8.1 installed and I can honestly say that autopilot is a serious step into the future. 90% of my long term driving now uses autopilot with me only fully driving in construction zones or bad roads or city driving. Its so amazing it probably saved my life! I dozed off one late night driving back from Washington DC to Miami. Autopilot sensed my hands weren't on the wheel and woke me up with a chime all while the car was safely maneuvering thru traffic! This is hands-down the best and safest vehicle that has ever been produced for the public! It compliments aerodynamics and ingenuity so well that the feeling can only be similar to the shock and awe of the Citroen DS of 1955 that paved the way for safer more efficient quality cars. By the way the Tesla has no engine so say goodbye to gas and hello more trunk space! 😱🤗👌

tesla,model-x,2016,MHC, 10/16/2016,The model x is years ahead of the competition,5,"I have only had the car a few weeks so I can't attest to reliability but everything else is fantastic.  The car is quicker ( without Ludicrous) than my GL 63 AMG Mercedes that I traded in for the car. It handles and rides more comfortably as well.   Not to mention 90MPG equivalent versus the 16mpg I used to get.  The car is a technical phenomenon-- Teslas driver assistance autopilot is way ahead of Mercedes, Audi and Porsche.  Automatic doors are great.  The ability to control the car from your phone is best in class.  The helicopter bubble windshield has the visibility my wife loved when we test drove the Range Rover but the the tesla drives ten times better than the Rover.  There are a few quirky things that are different but clearly the future is here and the model x is it.

tesla,model-x,2016,Ed, 01/01/2017,You love it and hate it,3,"I love the car then again I dislike it.  The car is techy in every way but it seems the reliability does not back it up yes it's a very fast car and Uber techy but when your constantly in the service department it's not very pleasant I thought my Land Rover was unreliable this is on a different level. But it was expected buying an electric vehicle when the technology isn't very mature. But seriously that could of made the interior quality much better! This car feels like a cheap American car. But we know why we paid those expensive price tags! But tax savings plus the incentives that California gives and the potential gas savings! (I own a Landrover and a silverado 3500) it makes the car not that expensive! Overall an 3 star rating

tesla,model-x,2016,Tightend11, 01/12/2017,I test drove one and never looked back,5,"It's fast, comfortable, reliable, and relaxing to drive, if you don't want to buy one don't test drive it, that did it in for me. We have an 11 month old, super easy to get him in and out of his car seat with the falcon wing doors"
tesla,model-x,2016,George Hawley, 06/07/2016,Model X-Still Great after 4+ years,4,"The Model X is a crossover with motorized hatchback and up to three rows of seats, seven in all, built on the frame of the Model S sedan.  It is about 2"" longer and 10"" higher than the Model S.  It inherits the battery-powered drive units from the Model S with three all-wheel-drive configurations:  75D, 90D, and P100D.  The number indicates the kilowatt hour energy capacity rating of the big battery pack, the D stands for dual motors and the P indicates the super fast performance model.  Like the Model S the X is very quick 0-60, leaving all other comparable SUVs far behind.  I have the seven seat, 90D option.  With the two third row seats folded flat there is a reasonable amount of storage space.  There would be more had the second row seats been designed to fold, which they now do in newer versions.

The controls and Autopilot systems are inherited based on Mobileye Corp. software work quite well, but because Tesla broke up with Mobileye, will probably never be improved.  Because of its height the X is much easier to get in and out of than the S, especially the second row via the iconic Falcon Wing Doors.  The third row has limited legroom, okay for small kids.  The self-presenting front doors and spectacular rear doors have sensors to minimize the chance of banging into people or objects.  

The autopilot software features in current and recent models was developed by Tesla.  With 9 cameras, a radar system, 12 ultrasonic sensors and a far more powerful computer than I have, current models promise full self driving capability features as a future option. 

The windshield rises overhead to provide a spectacular vista for the driver.  The rear view mirror in my car is somewhat blocked by the second row middle seat head rest.  This is not a problem for taller drivers or the six seat configuration.  Newer designs have eliminated this issue.   

The Model X is a very comfortable car to drive on road trips, although it uses about 15% more energy per mile, depending on speed, than the Model S because it pushes more air and is about 10% heavier.  Driving 600 miles a day takes about an hour longer than with the S due to added charging time at the Tesla Superchargers.

If the idea of an ultra-safe, super-quick, up to seven passenger car that can park and practically drive itself for $100,000+/- appeals to you, go for it.  You will be sporting the Tesla grin every time you get into it.  After 4 years and 33, 000 miles, I'm still delighted with the car, not to mention the only things needed at annual service visits are cabin filter, windshield wipers and windshield washer fluid, if you don't take care of those items yourself.  The only other routine maintenance that I have done is to buy new tires at 25,000 miles.
"
tesla,model-x,2016,Bel Day, 10/30/2016,Best SUV ever,5,"If you have children, this is the best, safety, SUV around. Third row access is easy thanks to the Falcon wings, while middle row child seats can be accessed without hitting your head on the roof, or killing your back while hunching over. Add solar on your house and you can power it with sunshine. Amazing.

Update 6 months later - had a great 3,000 mile road trip. There's nothing this vehicle can't do. My husband and I fight over who gets to drive it.

Update 4 years later - over 60,000 miles on it. Husband got himself a Model 3. X is perfect, minor sensory tweaks by service required for ""Wings"". Still loving it!

Update - traded in for smaller Tesla Model Y. Still highly recommend if someone needs a large SUV.

Roomy interior!
No more gas stations!
Cons:
Falcon doors slow and annoying.  Sometimes they open only a few inches.  Front doors are slow to open, or sense things are in the way and won’t open.  SUPER annoying.
Cup holders are located too far behind the driver to use.  
The middle console makes no sense. 
Sun visors please!  Please!! Please give me a real visor!  Sun glare is very hard on the eyes.  Every single day I long for a regular car roof.
Wish Elon had simply put his battery technology on the body of a Lexus or Mercedes SUV.  
The interior layout of Mercedes and Lexis is far better than Tesla. If they come out with a long range electric car I’ll switch immediately.

tesla,model-x,2016,Lorraine, 05/02/2017,Wow to the tenth power!,5,"Breaking is not only breaking but it is also recharging the battery. And you really don't have to break. You just take your foot off the gas. It almost stopped by itself. But it's so fluid you really don't even notice it. Getting in and out was great for my parents who are older as the doors just lift up and all they had to do for swing their feet out. It was a little bit more of a drama or get it out of the third row but not too much hassle as the seat aisle is very large. I am in love with a car display option for GPS. My parents could see all of the information from the second row. There were no questions as to if I knew where I was going. So in love with his car!

tesla,model-x,2016,Aug, 09/28/2017,"Unsafe autopilot, poor door operation",1,"If you get ANY tesla's, DO NOT purchase autopilot.  As great as they market it to be, it's unsafe and it's seriously a matter of time before someone, whether it be a tesla owner, or another driver on the same road as a tesla, gets seriously hurt due to autopilot.  What's ironic is that Elon is using consumers to collect data so it can work out the problems with it's autopilot.  Autopilot is sold as a ""beta"" version. I bet no one knows about this before purchasing the car or autopilot.  It's a huge fraud what he's doing, and hopefully one of the lawsuits will nail him for it.  The doors suck and the sensors to detect how much space the doors have to open are placed incorrectly and are faulty. Have already had it replaced twice in less than 10 months of owning the car.  The sensors to open the front doors are placed where any normal person would stand to open the door.  This causes the door to not open fully, and requires extra effort and time to get into the car unnecessarily.  This, hands down is the most regrettable purchase I have ever made.

tesla,model-x,2016,Johnny, 10/24/2017,Best vehicle on this planet,5,"Attention! If you have problems navigating your smart phone (with the exception of anything apple) then this car is probably NOT for you. On a positive note, this car has changed my life! I have owned my 2017 X for 6 months and managed to put 21,000+ trouble free miles so far. I've taken this car up and down the mountains, everglades, dirt, rock, middle of nowhere and I loved every bit of it. The view from inside is better then my convertible! The cooling seats are great in the summer plus you can cool or heat the car from the tesla app on your phone before you enter + lock/ unlock doors + even move it forward and backward for tight parking etc. Adjustable suspension knows what to do on bad terrain. Autopilot sure helps in traffic or long trips just be alert since bad drivers are everywhere and construction or roads with no lines or faded lines can confuse the car periodically. I have the 5 seat configuration and my rear seat folds down. I heard all the new models do that now too. Charging is super easy and fast compared to stopping multiple times to fill up and the navigation is so spot on it has signal even when my phone didn't! I've heard of some people having issues with their cars I'm def not one of them and it's actually pretty rare. Again please read my first sentence and that should explain everything. Upon delivery you are treated with excellent service and a full introduction of the vehicle. It will take a few days to soak in all the amazing stuff this SUV (that drives like a lotus) can do!

tesla,model-x,2016,P90D Test Driver, 11/26/2017,"If you want quick acceleration, buy this car!!!",4,"Yes it's all electric, and yes, it's pricey around $90-100K for a ""used"" car, but if you can find a low mileage Model X P90D in excellent condition, then it's certainly worth looking at.  Most people will find the 2017 75D or 100D regular version (not the ""P"" version) to have about the same look & feel as I didn't see that many changes from the 2016 to 2017 for both the ""P"" and ""non-P"" versions, but the one option on the P90D X that I test drove had ""Ludicrous Mode"".   For those who don't know what that is, it's basically taking a very fast car and making it ridiculously faster.  Other than on a race track, I'm not sure how beneficial that option really is to the average driver, but at around 3.0 seconds from 0-60, you certainly can get a jump on others at the stop light or merge onto the freeway very quickly.   I guess it's one of those ""nice to haves"" but probably not used that often in a commuter car.  Best thing to do is test drive both the ""P"" and ""non-P"" cars at a Tesla dealer and see for yourself.  Keep in mind a ""new"" 2017 P100D with Ludicrous mode will probably set you back over $140,000.  So for a (1) year old car with under 10K miles, at a price of around $90K, a 2016 Model X P90D is a substantial $(50,000) savings, or on the other hand a huge loss if you bought it ""new"" in 2016.  By the way, I saw the sticker price of the car I test drove to add ""Ludicrous Mode"" was $10,000, and the total price of the car was $147,000.  Both have Tesla's 50,000 mile 4 year warranty and the 8 year on the battery & motors, but check with the Tesla dealer to confirm these numbers.  The only drawback was my test car had Autopilot v 1.0, and not the latest v 2.0 Autopilot, so the 2016 I drove could not eventually be a 100% self-driving car.

You will also save about $10,000 in the first 4 years based on current gas prices.  BTW, all currently new 2017 Tesla Model X vehicles and presumably the 2018 models come with fold-down back seats to add to the storage capacity of the vehicle, and the 5,000 lb. hitch is standard. Now have 28,000 miles on the vehicle without any problems. Have NEVER seen any powertrain problems reported by ANY Tesla owners. There are very few powertrain moving parts, and they are all sealed and maintenance-free. Have yet to bring the vehicle into the shop for anything. Powertrain battery warranty is 100,000/10 yr. but if properly recharged should last to 300,000 miles with only 20% reduction in range. Monthly software updates come thru your home internet system and add features including new driver assistance features, adding to driver safety. The fit and finish has been fine on the car. Be aware in weather below freezing your range will be reduced by about 20%.

tesla,model-x,2017,Dallen Ormond , 12/31/2017,Fantastic,5,"In the past 12 years I have owned 18 different vehicles. I purchased the model X 100D 2 months ago. It accelerates faster than my Golf R, Nismo 350 Z, or Infinity M class. The car is as luxurious as my MB E63 AMG and rides as well as my Cadillac CTS-V. Recently I had to take it off-road. I live in the mountains and had to pick up a sick child. The roads were unplowed and recommended chains only. I simply raised the suspension and easily drove miles and miles in 2 feet of snow. It handles as well off road as my Toyota Tacoma. Then driving down the canyon I didn’t have to hit my brakes once because of how the vehicle torque charging works. The canyon is a 65 mph 5-6% grade for 20 miles. Finally, because of the torque charging my battery charged on the way down the canyon. 

I can’t express how impressive this vehicle is. Elan Musk not only built a competitor he built a game changer. 

After 1 year this is simply the most amazing vehicle I have ever owned. My opinion is even better than last year.

2 years down. The only maintenance has been tire rotation.

Great Car!!! I love the software upgrades, and even better they update like my iphone updates. The vehicle feels new all of the time. "

tesla,model-x,2017,Bamboo, 06/21/2018,If only my X can fly,5,"Like most consumers, I've owned five different cars and wanted to try something different but also environmentally friendly.  As with anything new there's a transition period but in all honesty, I will never go back to gas cars!  Beside the supercharging and little to no maintenance, my X is just an incredible work of innovative technology matched with style, efficiency, and green consciousness!  The only issue is that for back seat riders you do feel the bumps a bit more because there's not a whole lot of cushion/shock absorption but let's just say given the all-around luxury features, my riders got over it quick.  Just love my ride and highly recommended!

tesla,model-x,2017,Richard Moore, 11/21/2018,"A $100,000 turd on wheels",1,"Purchased a 2017 model x in July 2017 nothing but problems I was told I would get 230 on a charge I’m lucky if I get 150 miles so forget road trips.  Numerous problems from defective start up batteries, bad key fobs, light bulbs burning out,air leaking from all the tires. The lastest issue was a flat tire no spare ok but their tow drivers don’t have a spare either ? So the car has to get towed to the dealership and  guess what?  The dealership doesn’t have a spare tire either so the car has to sit for 5 days while their own dealership orders a tire.                                               Positive nice acceleration and it’s quite but the instrument panel is strange.                        The sales people lie the updates  they promise and all those charging stations they promise are going to open in 3 months never happen. This car is nothing more than a $100,000 turd on wheels folk do not buy this car!! Go buy a Lexus !

tesla,model-x,2018,TN, 08/30/2018,Not for everyone,5,"Model X is unique. Either you like be it or hate it. To me, it is like buying your first iPhone. You won’t find the key pad. Things may be working today but won’t tomorrow due to the latest patch. You won’t be happy if you think you are buying a car. You will be very happy if you want to buy a technology. It is a toy that can be driven and it is fun.

tesla,model-x,2018,James P, 06/16/2019,No room?? No way!,5,"Someone in March had written a review about being 6’4 and not fitting. I’m 6’8 and fit extremely well, room to spare! Found it very comfortable and roomy.  For the taller folk, like myself, you have to drop the seat a bit as you do in every vehicle when that’s an option.   Zero fit and finish issues. The technology, acceleration and everything else about this car was on par for what can be expected. Wait, that’s not true, it exceeded all expectations.  I have driven and owned many various cars and suvs in my life and the Tesla experience is by far the most fun and rewarding.  I can’t see driving anything else from here on out.  If you’re unsure if this is the right vehicle for you, or any vehicle you’re considering, rent one for a few days. That’s a low cost way to make sure you’ll love it prior to a major purchase.

tesla,model-x,2018,Ryan W, 07/04/2018,"Crazy good, despite many small flaws",4,"A lot of the existing reviews online, including the 2017 and 2018 Edmunds reviews here are a little out of date due to the continuous improvements that Tesla makes to their production process as well as the after production updates via Tesla's amazing over the air update system. For example, the latest navigation and autopilot updates as of July 2018 make this car vastly superior to anything else on the road in these areas.  Also, based on my model that was built in late 2017, the fit and finish seems to be slowly improving as well. 

PROS: 
- As noted by many others, the handling and acceleration are better than any other SUV on the market. Driving a Model X feels like magic.

- Utility is excellent due to the huge amount of interior space, thanks in large part to the lack of engine and gas tank. Yes, there are no roof racks, but most of what you would put up on the roof can be stowed inside the cabin or in the fronk with much more convenience. For towing, the auto leveling air suspension, included tow hitch, and the vast torque allow the model X to easily tow just about anything. (Quantis just towed a 787 Dreamliner with a Tesla Model X for publicity). Technically though, the X is legally rated to 5,000 lbs and towing will reduce your range by roughly 20% depending on various factors, so you have to take that into account. 

- Range provided by the 100D is fantastic at around 300 miles. That along with the Tesla charging network, road trips have been a dream. 

- My favorite feature is Autopilot, which has gotten so good that I no longer want to drive without it. It feels a lot safer and easier to have both yourself and the car reacting to situations in real time. For example, if you look down for a moment and someone slams on the breaks in front of you, Autopilot will automatically slow down. I've also noticed that in dark, rainy conditions, Autopilot seems to be better at seeing the road ahead than I can due to the array of sensors, which was really surprising. 

- The built-in Navigation is the best I've seen in any car by a wide margin. It's just like using Google maps on your phone, but built-in and easily visible on the huge display. The voice recognition works amazingly well too, meaning you can just say; ""navigate to home depot"", and it just works. 

CONS: 
- The falcon wing doors are great to show off to your friends, but they are not practical. In a normal garage for instance, they can't open fully so you have to crawl under them to get into the car. 

- Tesla's push button door handles require a lot of force to activate and are irritating. I'd personally prefer the 3% hit to range to get back regular door handles. 

- My Model X was built in late 2017 and the build quality is clearly improving, but I did have a couple of small fit and finish issues that required me to drop my X off for repair immediately after pickup. 

- The X is not an off-road capable SUV. 

- The worst thing about the model X in my opinion are the seats. The Model X seats don't even compare to a top trim 2018 Honda CRV. My wife has a 2017 Lexus RX 450h which is half the cost, and the Lexus seats and about twice as comfortable and are much more luxurious than the throw away vinyl seats you get in the Tesla Model X. Since nicer seats can be be procured from the same vendors that make seats for the other car brands, it seems criminal to me that the Tesla Model X is so badly lacking in this area.  If you get a Tesla, you will have the best car on the planet, except you will probably have the worst seats of any car in the $40K+ price range. The included ""vegan leather"" seats, seem to be there to placate PETA and other environmentalists that don't like leather being used in cars. I get that, but at the very least, vinyl should be standard and real, perforated leather, similar to what you find in every other nice car, should be an option. 

Overall,
 the Tesla Model X is such a vast improvement over every other SUV on the market, it's definitely worth putting up with the small flaws to own one.

tesla,model-x,2018,SailorMD, 06/06/2019,Wow what a ride for an SUV,5,"We have owned this car for just over a year near.  It is nearly the best car I have ever owned (first is our Model S).  The car has a unique design.  it is incredibly fast and handles well.  the software is regularly updated and the new autopilot with navigation software is incredible.  Once on the interstate the car basically drives itself.  so much easier than having to deal with traffic etc.  the touch screen is huge.  the cameras give crisp clear images.  Recharging via the tesla supercharger network is even faster and ""refueling"" rates are starting to approach gas tank refills.  I am really looking forward to the continued upgrades in the autopilot!  I will never buy another fossil vehicle again.

tesla,model-x,2018,Jsmother, 09/28/2018,golfforfood,5,"Check the tires pressure at least once a week. I have been driving for over 40 years, and I have owned 16 cars or trucks/SUVs. This is the best handling, cars i have ever owned.  You will need to have a little patience learning how to work all the gadgets, however I have not got used to falcon doors in the garage.  I enjoy driving pass the gas stations.  Take the test drive before you buy. Special note: I only had the SUV when someone broke the front glass to get me brief case.  It took 27 days to get the replacement glass. Aside from that incident, I am very happy with the SUV, and I plan to keep it for at least 15 years.

tesla,model-x,2018,C. Hall, 02/25/2019,"Really enjoying this car, it's something special",5,"My wife and I have had our Model X75D for about 11 months. So far it's been great. Road handling and acceleration are spectacular, to the point that I can't bring myself to actually depress the accelerator to the floor. Front seats are super-comfortable, cargo capacity is amazing. Falcon wind doors are a hoot, and make backseat access super-easy. Things you should know? 1) It's a big vehicle 2) rear seats are just average comfortable 3) Bluetooth player is adequate, but just. On the happy surprise side, over-the-air updates are a real thing and can add real functionality. Maintenance? None required. Range? We're still getting used to the idea on long trips, but otherwise it's not a factor. For daily use just plug the thing in at home overnight once or twice a week. As others have mentioned, it's probably a mistake to think of this as just a car. It's the future and it keeps evolving even after you buy it.

February 2020 update: The car is still performing perfectly. Water in a taillight was fixed by a visit from the Tesla ranger under warranty. I still find the vehicle large when trying to park, though on a road trip it is superb.

tesla,model-x,2018,Deeps, 03/02/2019,Driving the future,5,"I had this car now for about five months. I want to give it some time before writing this review. Generally speaking the car is amazing. I wish I lived in an area where there was a service center however Tesla mobile service has been very responsive and very helpful. The only issue is that it sometimes takes a week or two to schedule a service appointment. The acceleration, the storage capacity,And the technology are amazing. I was a former Audi lover and I still really love their cars however the model X is still ahead. Yes there are some minor fit and finish issues but when I go back and look at my Audi I actually realize that it also had them I just never looked so carefully. In the end this is the best car I have ever owned and despite the steep price tag I have no regrets and can never see myself driving a gasoline vehicle again unless they were unusual extenuating circumstances. I also love the fact that they are software updates to keep improving my car. I never remember anything like that from prior vehicles I have on. For those of you who criticize the car I urge you the first to make sure you drive it and spend some time with it because it really is different from anything you’ve driven before.

tesla,model-x,2018,Bruce, 05/11/2020,Promises Not Kept,2,"I bought the model X to replace a Santa Fe Sport which I loved.  The SFS cost me $24,000 and I loved it.  The Model X $100,000 and I loved the promises that the sales person gave me.  

First, let me tell you what I like about the car.  I love the quick acceleration, The handling is excellent and the entertainment system and GPS is the best that I have had in any of the 30 or 40 cars that I have owned.

That is about the extent of it.  I bought the car prior to having a major surgical procedure that would lay me up for over a year.  I thought the self driving would be a plus, allowing me to remain independent in my recovery.  I paid for a completely self driving package which included a $3000 computer that would allow that.  They told me that it would be installed in the next 6 months.  After 14 months, I finally had the computer installed and it is still not completely self driving.  If you allow it to take over, expect to run stop lights, side swipe cyclists and run over pedestrians.  I thought that I would have free energy from my solar panels which regularly produced excess energy, but the car even when used just locally uses a huge amount of energy.  The updates that were supposed to increase functionality are a joke.  Instead of useful features, they send video games.  I now own the world's most expensive video game system.  

The features that I thought would be useful such as the sentry system which records events on the car's cameras, I found kept recording events that did not happen.  I would see events recorded and then take the car home, remove the thumb drive, put it in the computer and search files to no avail.  I finally had an incident with a car that backed into me and left paint on the back bumper.  I scoured the files to find nothing.  Fortunately the damage buffed out.  A recent update, supposedly allows one to view incidents on the car's computer screen, but, I will be damned if I can figure out how to make it work.  Forget getting anyone to help with phone support.  I used the sentry system when parking the car in a location for a week without charging capability.  I left it with a full charged battery and returned to find only 20% left.  Apparently, the sentry uses 200 watts which drained the battery.  I barely made it home.

Service is another issue.  I have had to have the vehicle serviced numerous times.  After a horrific experience at the service center, I have opted to have services done through the mobile service.  It is a nice convenience, but not the most knowledgeable technicians.  The wait time has decreased to about a week, but I have just rescheduled a repair for the third time. I had a key fail.  Put in a new battery and it still did not work.  The first time I had two repairs and the tech forgot to do the key thing.   The second time, he called me to let me know that he was on his way.  During the call, he developed uncontrollable coughing.  He reassured me that he was not sick.  Folks, we are in the midst of a pandemic.  

So...the car now languishes in the garage.  It does not serve the purpose for which I bought it.  I use it now only if I have to carry more than two passengers or large payloads.  I use my Corvette C8 as my daily driver.  It is much more fun to drive and seems to be much more reliable.

Since I wrote this review 5 months ago, a few things have changed.  First, I traded my Porsche for a 2020 Corvette which is now my daily driver.  Not much has changed with the functionality.  I continue to be frustrated with functions on the car which stop working and good luck trying to get help on this.  U tube videos are all about a year or so behind the changes and there is no phone support.  My best hope is my neighbor who has had Teslas since they first cam out and is an electrical engineer.

I am 6'4"" and you would think that a vehicle that has no engine in the front would be so stingy with the leg room.  The tesla has less leg room than many compact SUVs on the market.

Without Tesla world would not have known how good an electric car technology can be. Instant acceleration that would leave a Ferrari in shock, smooth quiet ride, outstanding autopilot, unbreakable motor and elimination of annoying car salesmen are some of the finest features of owning a Tesla. Car never feels old due to continuous over-the-air updates for software- just like iPhone. Range is impressive but suitable if your daily drive is less than 200 miles. Anything more and you would need some charging time. Interior is spartan, full of useful technology unlike many gadgety German cars. Rear doors are strange but kids love it. Supercharger network was fun to use and not busy at Barstow. 150 miles in 30 minutes, we got free overnight charge at hotel as well. 
After being introduced to this new world of driving experience, no Audi, BMW or MB will feel that good again.

tesla,model-x,2019,Mahmood Majid, 11/19/2020,Tesla model x is a failure,1,"i own 2019 model x. It is a $107K car brand new.  We leased it. Unfortunately we are so unhappy with the vehicle.  We cant drive the vehicle too far.  When it says fully charged at 220 miles range.  We are lucky to get 150 miles on the full charge.  I almost ran out of charge on the road since I went to the Harrisburg airport.  I drove only 150 miles and the full charge says i can drive 220 miles.  Thats with no heat running today when I realized I was not going to make it home.  I am stuck at a place to charge for almost 3 hours on 110 outlet.  And the charge has increased from 5 miles to 16 miles in 3 hours.  I cant even take the chance to leave until I have at least 20 miles charge.  Yes the mighty tesla is a complete and utter failure in my eyes for a car that costs $107K.  I would not buy this car again even if somebody gave it to me free.  So to the executives of tesla you have failed miserably.  Your battery charging system is horrible.

tesla,roadster,2008,Steve, 05/09/2010,Rewarding the early adopters,4,"I ordered this car two years before delivery.  There were plenty of snafus, but the final result is stunning. Incredible acceleration.  Not much impulse to go excessively fast if you can make a 911-owning passenger white-knuckled going from 0 to 45.  It's so effortless. Learned to drive without much braking - regenerative throttle behavior makes rotor wear obsolete. Driving: very low stance, and doesn't like rough roads. Ownership: the company works hard to make its owners happy, but living far from a company-owned store is tough. Early bugs and glitches were immediately fixed, even if Tesla had to fly a technician out to the car. "

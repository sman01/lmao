mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Brian, 09/01/2018,Mitsubishi is back!,4,"I just bought this SUV in the beginning of July so I had it for about 2 months now. The first thing your gonna notice is how sexy this thing looks depending on the color you get. I have the metallic gray and is shines just like the diamond red. The vehicle has nice black accents and black 18” alloy wheels. It also has tinted privacy glass on the back passenger windows. The performance is really good and the engine is pretty powerful together with the CVT transmission. 

The interior looks very nice and the seats are comfortable enough for longer trips. The back passenger seats recline and can be adjusted just right for child seats. They also fold down to the point you can put boxes and other wide items through the back and sides. All doors open wide and you get a lot of standard safety features that other expensive SUVs don’t. Apple car play and Android Auto is nice including a trackpad for navigating the 7” display up front. 

My only complaints is the way the vehicle turns sharp corners which has a little more lean then what I’m used to. Maybe it’s just me coming from a Lancer, but I would take it easy on the turns. The back window is split which gets in the way when you look through the rear view mirror, but you do get a backup camera so thank Mitsubishi for that! I would have liked some buttons for navigating the touchscreen but I guess that’s where these companies are going. I got used to it but I don’t know how old school people will react to it. There are 2 more trims levels above the LE but I feel for the price that I paid, I should have gotten heated seats and a sunroof. Other than that it’s very sporty, roomy, and good on gas so I feel like a made a good decision overall. I will do another updated review in the coming months if anything changes.

mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,William Scardanello, 03/19/2019,first time mitsubishi,4,"Just took delivery of our Mitsu Eclipse Cross last evening & literally drove the balls off this car today .      Overall looks are great ...ride comfort more than adequate .    No issue with interior room or layout... just some of the touch sensitive display & pad bit of a learning curve as i am "" old school "".      Performance seemed more than adequate , seeing we took this unit on a jaunt up & over the mountains where we live { south west p.a.  }   over to Maryland 's Deep Creek area & back .      No issues pulling the mountainous terrain , just keep it in the torque curve.   Turbo gives ya more umph when one needs it !     IDK, read reviews where the handling on this unit is sub par...i had no issues pushing this car through turns on the back roads under power while counter steering slightly .    Braking felt really good , evem under hard application coming down grades .    The CVT Trans is a bit of a learning curve .. seems like it's "" hunting "" at times .       Little noisy at hi way speeds ....can hear engine noise .....nothing i can't live with .     and the pricing we got from the dealer , couldn't pass this unit up .     Take into account that i am a retired ASE Certified tech with 30+ years under my belt...so this is an old car guy reviewing this unit .

mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,OrlandoLife, 11/19/2019,A great little SUV Ignore the so called Experts,5,"I was leary of test driving the Eclipse Cross after reading all the so called expert reviews that trashed this car. Most of them seem to not be able to get over the fact that its called Eclipse Cross, some reviewers even said they would probably like it better if it was called something else.  Really?  My other car is a 2015 CTSV that was my dream car when I bought it. I kept my 2011 Outlander I had at the time as a run around car and from the second I decided to sell that car, then did so several months back I missed having an SUV. Love, love, love my Cadillac but the best car for a daily driver it is not as is so fun to drive that the gas mileage sucks. So decided I was going to buy another Outlander so off to the dealer I went. I always liked the look of the Eclipse Cross (except the straight on back end view, buts its grown on me) but it wasn't even on my radar because of the negative ""expert reviews"". When I got to the dealer they had about 15 leftover EC sitting there all shined up with a big discounts sitting on the windshield. I decided to test drive both the Outlander and the Cross and I was really suprised with the EC....ended up buying a Black SEL and got 8600 off the sticker. It is smooth, quiet, fairly roomy and gets great gas mileage. I took in on a 2500 mile trip a few weeks after I bought it and got 28-29 MPG running 75-80 with the AC running. The safety tech works perfectly, better than my Cadillacs, love the bronze stitching on the leather. It's not a powerhouse, and yes it could use another 20-30HP...but its not as slow as the ""Experts"" and is peppy enough get out of its own way. (my CTSV has 556hp so I know what power is) In fact on my trip i took there is a stretch of road outside Wytheville VA that is a steep incline for about 6-7 miles going into the mountains and this car handles it like a pro no issues holding 75 MPH and just flow by the other cars. It handles well, the steering does not have alot of feel but has enough weight and it really sticks to the road with the AWD. OK the CVT is...well a CVT...my outlander had one and it was fine. At least this one has some fake shifts built so it mimics a normal auto a bit better. I would love for Mitsubishi do to a Ralliart version, add some more horsepower and put in their dual clutch. But as it stands for the price I paid it is a really good smaIl SUV that if like the Outlander will be bullet proof in its reliability and that I would recommend and buy again in a heart beat.

mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Ed Wysocki, 12/28/2018,Very satisfied,5,"Base model has everything i need at a great price. The warranties and Roadside Assistance give me confidence that i am covered for a long time !
"
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,SharonMitchell, 09/22/2018,Too short,5,"There is not enough leg room, front seats go as far back as possible but I need more leg room.  I still drive my 2010 Galant which gives me plenty of leg space plus space in the rear if I choose to sit while being chauffeured by my grand children but I still need higher car without going to Outlander Sport. Maybe next year you will give more leg room, other options are great including extra UB plugs in rear per my 10 years old granddaughter."
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Eclispe owner, 04/23/2019,Good Little SUV,3,"Has a lot more spunk/acceleration than other SUV's of this class test driven. Rides more like a car than the harshness of other's in this class. Is comfortable to drive, the arrangement of rear windows is a little odd but ok. I dispute claims of this SUV's driveability and ride on rough roads and outside noise. Has ride more to an auto than SUV, which most others test driven are harsh and stiff, for stability and handling they claim. Front seat room is very good and rear passenger seating is on par with all others  tested. All in all seems to be the best SUV value for my money, styling is a little out there, but price I paid overrides those concerns.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Arlita, 03/10/2019,Not very happy.,2,"I bought this car in September. I thought it was really cute and the diamond red gorgeous, but what I really liked about it the way the rear looked, turned out to be annoying.  That bar that goes across the back is annoying when you look through your rear view mirror. What I really don’t like about it is the acceleration. I do a lot of highway driving and 0-65 takes forever. It is like molasses running uphill on a cold winter morning.  Also, it cannot hold its speed. Maybe because I live in the mountains, but if you let up on the gas pedal just a little and your speed drops. Drives me crazy. I don’t like Apple play. I prefer the old navigation map, plus you have to use data and you are constantly losing the internet. Again that may be  the mountains , but I never had to deal with that with the old navigation.  Let’s just say I am already looking for a new car which is why I am on this site.

mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Jerry , 02/17/2020,Looks nice but made cheap,3,"First I dont want to get the wrong impression off that I'm completely bashing this ride. But here it goes. I truly believe all of us can attest that cars are not made like they was. They rattle more now... bend more and cry more. With that said it's to be expected that the intro year of bringing back the eclipse name will have some faults. I recently bought a 18 eclipse cross with 15,000 miles on it. I told myself 3 days later I should of kept my tacoma. It was pouring raining... I worked the 3rd the night before and was tired of being at the dealership (who really handled my whole sale completely wrong) Greer Mitsubishi is the name by the way. I will never go back there. But this car is nice. It just feels real cheap. The mind numbing cvt transmission is real sluggish taking off. There is alot of body roll in corners. Plastic everywhere. The driver seat makes noise. The door squeaks opening up. It could be a salvage for all I know that's how bad the dealership is. The sound system sounds blown or it could be just too weak. Mind you a 2 year old vehicle with only 15,000 miles should NOT be already showing heavy signs of wear and tear. It's time car makers be held responsible for what they are making these days. Money is tight for most of us. And the economy is tuff in these years. What happen to taking pride in building a reliable vehicle? Hey Mitsubishi... just a thought... dont put a sports car name on a power wheels car. And also Mitsubishi... may I say too... how about you drive the car your making for 10 to 15 years like most of us has too and see how much in love you'll still be with that oh so ""amazing"" cvt and sexy styling. I rest my case.

mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Vanna K, 03/20/2019,self reeving and ticking from engine,3,"I only had this SUV for 5 months and I'm hearing a ticking sound coming from the engine and while in park the car revs on its own. I called the dealership and was told that it maybe due to bad fuel (only concern is that this dealership has a habit of lying just to get the money). I tend to go to the same gas station when its time to fill up
"
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Sam, 03/14/2019,Every review Forgot to mention this !,3,"This car is loaded I have the SEl with the touring package. But the keyless remote does not open and close the lift gate. This is a feature which I thought was standard but it is not even there in the top of the line model. And it is considered as a SUV!!!! What is more frustrating is that the outlander has this function. Mitsubishi need to provide a solution of this. and  I mean ASAP. It is not only a safety. But could create problems for them if someone gets jammed.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,AJ Rivera, 02/04/2020,"Wanted a car just to get by, came out with gold",5,"I came from an '03 Kia Rio hatchback. Always having issues with it, so when the time came to get a new car, it was either this or a Jeep Compass. I checked the feature list on both, and a higher trim model with more features matched the base price on the Jeep. It felt like a no brainer to me. I don't really understand what the official reviewers mean by the car not handling well, it feels like a dream to me. Remember, I came from a cheap Kia, though, so possibly anything is an upgrade. But the space is amazing, the power's great, and I tend to get 40+ MPG on the highway when I drive. Maybe I'm nicer on the accelerator than most... anyway, I think I'll be keeping this car until it disintegrates!
"
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2018,Austyn, 05/06/2020,Great first BRAND NEW CAR,4,"I purchased one of these as my first BRAND NEW vehicle. Initially Seeing this car I noticed it was very attractive. I got the Mercury Gray Metallic color. I got the SE trim because it seemed to have many features without the big price tag. The paint is not the best and chips easy on the hood. I've gotten used to the CVT and fake shifts. One thing I have noticed is that if you go over a bump the car revs up high and tries to find out what happened. It's kind of annoying. I wish LED headlights were standard. The lines on the reverse camera don't move which is annoying. Overall 4/5 satisfaction for me. 
"
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2019,EC in PA, 12/21/2019,Good all around cuv,4,"First of all, this review is for the ES model. It has some very important differences from all the other models. It's the basic model with a manual hand brake and 16"" wheels. All other models have the electric emergency brake and 18"" wheels. This is important to remember because all of the ""expert"" reviews I have watched or read always test the more expensive models. Having 18"" rims with tires that equal rubber bands negatively effects ride quality and all off-road capability. 
If you're going to use this little crossover for anything other than maintained gravel roads or just getting to work in deep snow, you should most likely get the ES. My Eclipse Cross with 215/75/16 Yokohama Geolandar A/T tires have enough sidewall to actually conform to rough terrain and soften out the bumps.
Being a devoted Subaru fanboy, I really had my doubts about the AWD in this Mitsubishi. But I am truly impressed with it's capability. My wife and I have taken this thing where, in all honesty, we should have had a true 4WD with a rear locker. Even up on 3 wheels it still keeps going. Remember, I have all terrain tires that I can air down for more traction. An Eclipse Cross with 18"" wheels and all weather radials would never dream of following us.
You CANNOT get an Eclipse Cross with the electric E-brake and put anything smaller than 17"" wheels on it!  Smaller diameter wheels won't clear the E-brake mechanism.
Fuel mileage: Highway mileage is not all that impressive. In Eco mode, barely touching the accelerator, I can squeeze 29.8 mpg out of it. What's nice though is back rough roads and trails where were always in a low gear ratio I still get over 26. 
I find the motor to be zippy and the power more than enough. It's very comparable to our 07 2.5 Automatic Impreza. You won't blow anybody's mind with speed, but it will pass the people in the slow lane safely, even up hill 
So, why only 4 stars? It's because of the cvt transmission. It's the same brand used in Nissan and other cars. They're definitely not known for longevity. That being said, for some reason Mitsubishi hasn't had the problems with them others have. There are many Outlanders out there approaching 200k on an original cvt which is the same one used in the Eclipse Cross. Fingers crossed! Hopefully this transmission won't turn out to be a pile of crap.
I would definitely recommend this car to someone who understands what is is. It's NOT a sports car, a rock crawler, or something you want to tow with. If you want something with unique styling, more power than other compact cuvs that you can take camping and have some fun doing some mild off-roading (better known as soft roading) then get one. Just keep in mind what I mentioned about what makes the ES model unique.

mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2019,Vladimir, 09/29/2020,2019 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross,5,"A good small SUV. The ride is actually not as bad as advertised. I drove the care on mountain highway, and it held up pretty well, no rolling. I enjoy driving this vehicle. Front seats are very comfortable, and mold well to my body. Rear seats are sort of raised, and comfy as well. Visibility is good, although split rear windsheald  / window take some adjusting to.  I like the design of the vehicle. Quality of the materials used is above average. Small 1.5 litre turbo engine is peppy. It is not super fast and powerful engine, but it is more than enough. 
Overall, a great vehicle from Mitsubishi, and definitely an upgrade from RVR.

"
mitsubishi,eclipse-cross,2019,Robin Marsh, 10/27/2020,Eclipsee Cross,4,"Love this car we bought 1 year ago, however, there are some features that you would think would be included with its vehicle as most cars get these as standard.
1. auto-lock when your driving 5mph or more
2. light in the glove box
3. button to open tailgate
4. lights on the bottom of the doors
5. Bluetooth while on phone only comes out of 1 speaker
We do like this SUV a lot. I would recommend buying.

mitsubishi,mirage,2000,lalalaaa, 11/19/2012,I LOVE my car,4,"This car is awesome. I bought it used in 2008, it had 2 previous owners, one for a year or two and the other for about 6 years before i bought it. This thing is sturdy. I've hit things, I've been hit and it will not quit. I've got some pretty bad cosmetic damage. Like, really bad, but i just cant bring myself to give it up because i have not had any major mechanical issues. My mother has a much newer Mazda 6, that she has had both transmission and alternator issues with. The most serious thing i had to get replaced thus far is a bearing. I need to get my exhaust manifold replaced because it is making my car kinda loud, so that is next on the list, but i won't give this car up until I HAVE to"
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,excellent2, 01/23/2012,Really a good car,4,"Ive had my 2000 mitsubishi mirage for 6 yrs and and it has 267873 miles all ive ever done to it is change the oil and tranny fluid, put new tires and brakes this car is by far the best car ive ever had it is still runing strong it is better than my honda if this car ever goes under im buying another one."
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,Toya, 12/18/2008,Never Would Have Made It,3,"I got my 2000 Mitsu. Mirage DE in April of 2001 after I wrecked a Honda Accord and I was not happy about it. It was plain and cheap (I was 18 and wanted something sporty). However, when I got it, it only had 15,000 miles on it and I'm still driving it today over 7 years and I have a little over 192,000 miles on it. I put rims on it to make it look nice and a sound system for my entertainment. I have never ever had any major mechanical problems with it, it took 5 years before anything went out on it and I got it fixed immediately, I get my oil changed every 3 months(just because) and I love my car. I've taken good care of it and it is taking good care of me, and it's great on gas."
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,depawindu, 11/17/2009,Mitsubushi DE Coupe 2000,4,"I bought this great little car new and it runs faithfully with almost no maintenance. Its paint began to oxidize on the top and flat surfaces after 8 years. The electric windows both broke after 4 and 5 years. The turn signal failed at 8 years also.The DVD player broke after 3 years.  Otherwise, it has been wonderful. I've had one accident; it is incredibly strong and takes a hit and keeps going."
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,unc25, 07/08/2003,great!,4,"I dont understand the problems that 
people have with their mirages...I have 
owned two and im only 17!!!  I had a 
white 95 and nothing went wrong except 
the tranny went on me and had that 
replaced!!  I just recently got a 2000 
de sedan and other than it being an 
auto I have no qualms about it!!  Maybe 
if you people would change your oil and 
fluids regularly and do routine 
maintanence then you shouldnt have very 
many problems with your car.

Oh you do need wider tires!! They help 
out alot on the roads!!  I went and got 
some 17x7's and man it handles just 
fine besides the body roll which can be 
fixed with strut bars upper lower/ 
front rear!"
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,kycat52, 02/28/2013,STILL GOING STRONG AFTER 16 YEARS,5,"I bought this Mirage new in February 2000, I've driven it for 16 years and it still gets over 30 mpg.
I drove it in Washington DC from Feb 2000 to Jun 2007, 76 miles a day, in heavy traffic and on the beltway.
It got 40 mpg on the highway then.
This car amazed local mechanics in that it has NO oil leaks, everything still works and all I have done is routine maintenance.
In 2012, I had to put new struts all around and outer tie rod ends on both sides, other than that it has been routine maintenance.
I plan to drive it until it is out of service.
Then I'll probably buy another Mitsubishi to replace it.

mitsubishi,mirage,2000,MY LIL BUGGY !!!, 04/07/2009,Cell phone totals my MPG,4,"Bought it after 1 test drive ! I gotta give it to them, after 9.5 yrs & 41mpg's I did nothing but regular maint. and this car never let me down ! Thru 16""s of snow she just would not quit! Today 4/7/09 it was totaled by a cell phone in use! The power was slack especially w/ac on but other then that & some interior improvements would have been nice I'll never replace it for the money paid 13,000 & some change I never once had this car in a shop but for regular timing belt change @ 100,000."

I'm concerned if i was to hasty in buying a car. I really didn't want to make car payments. The car dealer seem very trustworthy and honest. 
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,Nice car, 08/04/2007,Good car,4,"I just got this car about a week ago.  So far it is an awesome car.  The only complaint that I have are the cup holders are really annoying trying to put them back in there place.  They get stuck and take like a minute to put in when it should just slide in.  The car has 93,000 miles so its very reliable just get oil checked every 3,000 miles and the car will last forever.  My next door neighbor has the same car and there's is up to 100,000 miles and still runs good.  But my red car looks a lot better then there tan one.  "

mitsubishi,mirage,2000,Dude From Clevland, 01/11/2009,Worst Car Ever owned,2,"Considering I have owned a Pinto, 2 Escorts, a SHO, and original Rabbit diesel, that is saying a lot. Bought new. First week engine light started going on and off, 4 years later finally did my own tune up and it went away. The car's paint faded after 9 months and the rust started 13 months after purchase. My wife was diligent at changing oil. At 80k it has been diagnosed as having bad valve seals.  Replacing anything is a hassle that requires isn't easy.  Lights for instance are held in by silly clip.     Now at 80,000 the car looks and drives like a car with 280,000.  The door leaks air, the CD even quit at 50k, the gas door has seized up, and it has an exhaust leak."

It kept me safe, after looking at it in the junkyard I'm lucky to be alive. The car runs GREAT, my second one the only work I've done to it from when I bought it was a timing belt and water pump along with an oil change. GREAT car and safe. The car shifts well, very smooth. Awesome on gas, mine gets 25 city miles. I do A LOT of driving, it's a cute car great for new drivers.  "
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,rasid, 01/20/2008,Mirage review,3,"I have had this car for over 4 years. It has always been reliable to me, getting about 30-35 mpg, even with aftermarket wheels that weigh about 3x more than the stock ones. The 5 speed manual shifts very smoothly and has some get up and go to it, and handles corners fairly well. The stock sound system is decent enough to the average driver. The interior cloth pattern is unique, but nothing special. The back seats are better suited for small children as they are compact. The instrument panel is easy to read, but most mirages don't come with a tachometer. Over all it is a reliable, fun, and has a great fuel economy."
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,ilhavenese, 12/06/2012,My favorite car (by a wide margin)!,5,"I bought this car brand new & have owned it for 12 yrs.
In that time it has had all regular maintenance done according to the owner's manual, & I've had 0 problems with it.
The car drives as nice 12 years later as the day I bought it.
I'm up to 133,000 miles & would drive this car anywhere in the country with confidence.
I've owned a Galant (replaced the Galant; I wanted a manual transmission & Galants no longer came in them), Prelude, & currently also own a 1969 Mini Cooper (classic version as opposed to a new 1), & this is by far my favorite car to drive (even with the fun appeal that the Mini has).
Of the cars I own, this 1 handles the best, is 100% reliable, & averages 40+ mpg."

I did 3 tune ups on the car, and oil change every 3-4 months.  The car never broke down on me, but as a preventive maintenance, I had the water pump and timing belt changed at 65K.  "
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,Mirage Convert, 02/18/2002,Good value for the money,4,"Good, reliable vehicle on a budget! I drove a Civic for 10 years, until  suffering sticker shock last summer when replacing. The Mirage, with its ""Civic feel"" has comfortable seats, good acceleration (113 HP) even with automatic, and handles extremely well in snow. Powerful A/C, heater, defroster, and stainless steel exhaust system. My '94 Mirage STILL has its original exhaust system and I live in the salt belt. As for MPG, expect 33-35."

mitsubishi,mirage,2000,TheNamesLisa, 02/03/2003,Argh!,2,"After owning a trouble-free Nissan 
Sentra for 8 yrs, this car is very 
disappointing.  I only got rid of the 
Nissan because it wouldn't pass my 
state's emission test.  Rides like a 
dump truck, has no ""get up and go"", has 
surprisingly poor fuel economy & is 
very noisy (lots of air noise coming 
from the windows).  This problem became 
more apparent after my son shut all 
four fingers in the door at the top & 
his only response was a calm ""oh...my 
hand is shut in the door.""  But I'm 
stuck with it for the next 5 years, 
since I owe more on it than it's

travelling (around 140 Miles a day). 
Excellent handelling on highways plus 
really good on gas. It gives me around 
33/gal. Fun to drive. But little too

feature is the gears can be used as a 
manual transmisstion to some extent. 
All 4 levels can be manually controlled."

is, come and look at this car. It is 
not expensive and it is so reliable. 
You should check out all the 
reliability test that several website 
do and this car is ranked very high 
comparing to other cars in the same 
class.  I think Honda and Toyota is 
over priced. This one is just right. Of 
course there is no leather luxury, no 
fancy stuff that you expect in a 
Beamer, but it's a 13k car, what do you 
expect. So far I have never had any 
problem at all. As I state again, if 
you are to buy a car that gets you from 
A to B, then this is the car."

any real problems except having to 
replace the battery, but that was 
expected after four years.  If you 
keep up with maintenance, as you 
should, getting a mirage is a good 
idea, but the resale value is very low.
Tighten your nuts and bolts every so

mitsubishi,mirage,2000,michaelg21, 11/27/2003,Excellent Small Car,5,"I have owned my Mirage for over 3 years 
and have never had a problem with it. 
Mitsubishi makes some excellent cars 
but are still relatively unknown by 
alot of people-quality wise, they are 
just as well built as any Toyota or 
Honda out there but are $1000's less. 
They give you far more for your 
money.Unfortunatly the resale value is 
poor-I think it is because many people 
are not convinced they are as good as a 
Honda or Toyota but for the money-I 
think they are better! Anyone who buys 
one will agree."

uncomfortable.  I have also had to 
replace the dash which quit working all

after purchased, and both rear hubb

major highway.  My little Mirage 
withheld the impact of TWO, yes TWO 18-
wheelers spinning me around on the 
highway.  I take some offense to those 
who say the car is built poorly.  I 
will miss my car, which is obviously 
totaled.  Now to deal with the 
unfortunate resale value my insurance

another Mirage if I had to."
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,Larry33, 11/24/2005,Good Car on Used Market,4,"I bought a 2000 Mitsubishi Mirage to replace a flooded car in Hurricane Katrina.  I expect that it will most likely provide good reliability due to its Japanese manufacture.  Its interior design is modern, useable and easy to understand.  The exterior is what you would expect from a '00 model year.  The trunk space is good.  The car drives well and its body integrity feels better than most other small cars, especially Kia or Hyundai models of the same year.  My opinion is this is a great car for anyone looking for a good used car that gets good gas mileage and is well built. The fact that this car historically depreciates quickly is advatageous to used car buyers."
mitsubishi,mirage,2000,PhillyO, 03/03/2006,Lots of Car for Less,4,"I bought my 2000 Mitsubishi Mirage with only 12,995 miles on it in April, '01.  Now, in March of '06, I have over 112,000 miles on it, and my only problem is that my AC does not work (it needs to be charged, that's all).  It has gotten me through snow, ice, and all that is not nice.  It's not the most powerful car in it's class, but it will get you around slower cars on the interstate without much effort.  Everytime I feel the need to trade in or sell my Mirage, I drive it once more, and I'm reminded as to why I still have it."

It was a great deal for a used car but 
I quickly realized that the car lost 
it's appeal on me when I noticed how 
sensitive the wheels were to the road. 
If anyone's driven on CA-580 knows the 
road is full of potholes, cracks, and 
whatever else. You must have a steady 
hand and heart to drive this 
lightweight car around the Bay Area.

When i first got her she had 100k miles and put me back only $1800. I work delivery, commute to college,
have another job that is 13 miles away one way, redline her daily (the 1.8l beast roars at high rpms) and shes been totaled THREE TIMES (only once in my ownership)

I only average around 23 MPG which isnt terrible considering my foot is rather heavy. Perfect for commuting, car is nothing exciting. "
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,herrstrauss, 12/15/2011,2001 Mitsubishi Mirage ES 4dr Sedan,4,"Hi,

I purchased my 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage ES 4dr Sedan back in August, of 2011.
I paid $1,500.00 cash for the car, the odometer read 160,000 miles, I thought I was buying a dying car, or a car on the verge of death.
(at the time I knew nothing about Mitsubishi).
But this car has been anything but a dying car, it has been a great first car.
I've even gone as far as naming my car buster.
This is a terrific starter car for anyone, old, middle aged, or young.
Almost little to no maintenance, get in and drive.
This car has never let me down.
The Japanese really built an amazing car.
I personally thank Mitsubishi motors for building a superb vehicle that was built with quality in mind."
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,Mike, 11/11/2015,Would buy another brand new if they re-made these!,5,"Truly unbelievably reliable.  Bought this from friends who were original owner and nothing but normal maintenance has ever been done to this other than some emissions things that needed to be done for living in Illinois (car came from Indiana).  Car now has over 211,000 miles on it and still going strong.  Only issues are so minor I don't even care (cup holders as mentioned are long gone), driver side door electronic lock wore out, keys are getting worn so only one will open the trunk.  Lever to pop the trunk is broken.. but all these are so minor for such an old car, that the fact that nothing major has ever gone wrong yet on this car is truly a testament. Having had many used Ford's, Chrysler's, with MUCH lower mileage etc over the years and having to continually put in tons of work just to get the thing to run long enough to get to work, and then having this has been amazing.  I will truly be sad when the time comes, and I wish more cars were this simple, cheap and reliable.

160,000 miles on it, I've had it for 2 years, and the occasional repairs are just wear and tear - break pads, spark plugs.
A basic but very reliable car."
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,mattwc1, 07/14/2008,follow up to earlier review,4,"I believe a truly accurate review on a vehicle should include proper time/mileage increments. I currently have almost 150k on my 01 ES Sedan.  My opinion has not changes since my last review. I average between 31- 35mph on mostly highway commutes. This vehicle has not let me down. The engine while slow is smooth and reliable. The transmission works well with the engine. The car is much more comfortable than its size belies. I do agree that cruise control would be nice, the paint chips easily, and a tachometer should be standard. However, considering that I have not had a car payment in  5 years and the car is so easy to keep and maintain, I will gladly live without. only 1 non pm fix; AC line"
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,Immortal, 02/22/2005,economical and fun,4,"This has been the best car I have ever owned.  63,000 miles and still running strong.  No repairs other than tires, brakes, fuel filter, etc.  Gets on average 30-32 MPG.  Extremely well built, well designed engine compartment, comfortable ride.  Does not fair well in accidents though, my g/f rear ended someone at 20 mph and did over $4000 worth of damage to the front end."

Civic, however, when I saw this car I

mitsubishi,mirage,2001,keatz85, 09/24/2012,Fantastic Car!!!,4,"After my first car, a Pontiac that gave me nothing but trouble, I wanted to get a foreign car that was dependable and affordable.
The Mirage hit a home run.
Drove it for 7 years and 122,000 miles. Barely put any money into it except for normal maintenance.
Parts starting wearing out more around 170k miles but what do you expect?
Liked this Mitsubishi so much I decided to upgrade to a newer Galant.
So far it's awesome as well.
This car's value is one of the best, if not the best.
If you can find one with 100k miles or so, i'd say you're good to go for several years."
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,Gary, 06/23/2006,Save money on gas with this Mirage,4,"This car was made in Japan and came with 94% parts made in Japan also. For 5 years, it gave me no trouble at all. I just drove to dealership to buy a little bottle of touch-up paint. Its average gas mileage has been 31 mpg in local driving (with the air on most of the time during the summer),.  I am not sure about the highway mileage, but it must be better. The only thing I don't like is that it's not equiped with cruise control.  It makes my leg sour over long trips."
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,manythemiles, 04/13/2012,Underrated and underappreciated,4,"Bought car used in December 2011 with 144k on the odometer. Have driven the car 10k since purchase and am very pleased with it. Car gets very good gas mileage and has so far proven to be reliable and simple to maintain. All required maintenance can be done by anyone who has a basic knowledge of cars. Engine is well laid out and the small engine allows easy access to most components. Interior materials are of high quality and would rival the best. Dashboard layout isn't terrible, but I would've appreciated a higher radio placement. Cupholder is small and it's effectiveness can vary. Blocks radio. Overall though, I think I will be holding onto this one for a while. Very satisfied overall."
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,ccmike25, 05/11/2011,Bloody Amazing!,4,"This car is amazing and it still suprises me when people have never heard of it.
First of all it gets great gas mileage and secondly its like an indestructable tank I have had this car for years when I bought it it had 70K miles on it at current it has 215K miles on it and have never had to replace anything other than standard maintainance. It may be small and cramped (or I am just way to big) but it makes up for it in reliability and ease of care i have had no problem doing all the maintainance to this car myself and it is a breeze."

I'm constantly getting over 35 MPG. I use regular oil (change every 5k mile) and regular gas. The only issue I had at 105k miles was the spark plug cables which had to be replaced. Actually, I should still call it regular maintenance. All I can say buying a new car always pays off on the long run. Of course Mitsubishi deserves a lot of credit and now I understand better why the Mitosis services are struggling - these cars are not breaking down! "

Besides routine maintenance and the a/c compressor it has been very reliable so far. I am a delivery driver and my other job is a long commute so alot of those miles were hard on it and i also have a pretty heavy foot.

manual vehicles, the Mirage shifts 
gears very easily. There is an issue 
with interior room if passengers are 
large or tall, but that can be 
expected with a compact car. The

mitsubishi,mirage,2001,mattwc1, 03/16/2006,excellent commuter car,4,"This is an excellent commuter car. I purchased this car to travel over 40 miles (one way) to work. It has had no mechanical issues whatsoever. It has almost 90,000 miles on the odometer and is still bulletproof. I bought this car from Hertz Car sales at a firesale price and have made an excellent decision (value/reliability/comfort).  The fuel economy averages between 30 -36 mpg highway. I get in the high 20's in stop and go driving. I do agree that the paint chips very easily (especially the hood) and the dashboard is a little funky (no tachometer and good placement for cupholders but puddles form below on storage cubby). It provides easy access to the engine (plugs/filter/oil changes) for do it yourselfers!. This car is an excellent buy obscured by popular Honda/Toyota models."

I get about 28 mpg on a normal day and got about 34 mpg on my road trip. It handles great and is pretty quiet for this class of car, though there is some wind noise around the windows. Its speakers are pretty good. It is lacking in low-end torque, but has enough juice to get me out of hairy situations.  I had one problem with the A/C draining water into the car, but it was a two second fix. The tube had clogged and a little squeeze was all it took.  Keep up on the oil changes!"
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,jimcsmith1988, 10/30/2011,Indestructible,5,"Astonishingly reliable- I purchased in 2011 used, and within three days a wind storm dropped a 5000 pound tree on the hood. After chopping the tree up, the car took off as if nothing happened. With a mileage intensive job, I've been heaping miles on it without issue. Just swapped out the timing belt after 100K miles to be safe, but it gave no indication that it needed it. It is small, and I'd recommend the 4 door. The mileage is beyond incredible, I get somewhere between 30-35MPG on average, and that's with a 10 year old automatic setup. The pickup is not fast, but it can maintain 90MPH on the highway without issue. I smiled a bit when I overtook a new Challenger on the interstate."

mitsubishi,mirage,2001,DREA38108, 05/26/2008,I love my Mirage,4,I bought my mirage back in July of 2007. It is a 2001. I love the little thing. Especially since gas is very high now. At price of 3.75 I can drive 300 miles off 37 dollars and thats speeding most of the time. The thing that I don't like is that I don't have any cup holders in my car and the fact that it does not have auto locks and windows or cruise control. Other than that though this car is great. 
mitsubishi,mirage,2001,David, 11/17/2016,GREAT LITTLE CAR.,5,"Hello, I have had many, many cars through out the years from muscle cars to Hondas, and I am also a Mechanic. I bought this mirage for only $500. It has 253,000 miles on it. Runs like a top. Gets great gas mileage. I just run 87 octane gas in it, and I'm getting 30-32 MPG in the city! Not bad . it's very dependable. I know it's going to start every time I get in it. The cons: the window regulators are cable driven and are famous for the cables to break. But it only take about 15 minutes to swap one out. I had to change 3 of them when I bought it. Got all 3 at the local junk yard for $60.and fuel sending unit was bad. But also so easy to replace. The access port is under the back seat. (3) 8 mm bolts and you're done. I love this little car! I would recommend one to anyone who is looking for an a to b vehicle, or first car.

mitsubishi,mirage,2002,Jules, 08/08/2015,"From Myrtle Beach, SC to Oceanside, CA",5,"I felt the need to pay homage to this amazingly reliable car. I bought this car in 2009, used for $1,000 cash. This is and will likely remain the deal of a lifetime. It had 90,000 miles on it and had been regularly maintained. The only initial issue was a broken front right axel and a dented passenger side door, both from hitting a deer. The front right axel issue was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase.

I have been driving this car since and the axel issue the previous owner created finally gave way to bigger issues. It is now at 229,000 and I just paid a pretty penny to give her a well-deserved and vital brand new 2015 sports edition rack and pinion. This, alone should sway any potential buyer.

I call her Ole' Bessie and she is my best friend. I have driven this car from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Oceanside, California, and halfway back again. She's gone over the Rockies, driven to Vegas, New Orleans, Miami. This car has taken me everywhere I wanted or needed to go for the last 6 and a half years. 

Aside from my left turning signal and horn going out, the only problems I have had have been regular, to be expected, and small repairs. The worst problems were so miniscule; starter once and distributor cap once.

Regular maintenance is vital to longevity of any used car. I have done timing belt change twice since purchase, new serpentine and fan belts once, put on new spark plugs at 200k miles, regular oil change, of course, and the like.

The A/C has finally gone and squeaks when I try to turn it on. If it still worked I would actually be more surprised. Luckily, my climate is very mild so it hasn't been a main concern, however this will be the next thing to be replaced.

Great gas mileage on the interstate. I do believe it to be higher than most sites have estimated. As long as the car is well maintained it is very quiet on the road. Brakes work great- had a few close calls and was very glad for that.

The storage is good for a 2-door, as the back seat pulls down and open to the trunk. My fiance and I have moved with all of our things in this car over 10 times easy. We are minimalists, but the storage is still exemplary. 

I don't think I can say enough great things about the 2002 Mitsubishi Mirage. I would absolutely recommend this car to any and everybody. I will drive this car as long as possible (which will be a long time with such a quiet, reliable engine) and continue to restore her as the years go by because she has been so good to me and my fiance.

*UPDATE*
I finally traded her in. We decided to make a big move Northwest and we knew in our hearts that our wonderful little Mitsubishi just couldn't do it- not again, anyways. That being said, I drove it for 7 solid years, age 19 to age 26- from coast to coast, over the rockies, down through the bayou, through the deserts, with her little 1.5litre engine. From 90k to 260k and only ever had minor and normal maintenance issues arise etc. A week after trading her in, her transmission went. I think her heart broke because I just couldn't say goodbye. It was a very safe car. Many times it's quick reactions and great breaks saved me from accidents- I never got into a single accident in that car and clearly I have done some serious driving. My fiance actually took her for the trade in. I loved that car. Now I'm in a custom 2005 Buick LeSabre which is a great car, and certainly faster with it's 3800 V6 but I miss the Mits. If you ever come across one of these, buy it and cherish it. If you know how to do general maintenance on a car, or don't mind replacing a part here and there for $100 or less, it will never let you down. Ole' Bess RIP.

It was a sporty looking car.  The back part of it looks like Honda Coupe. I am not complaining about the power.  It could have more, but that would make it more expensive. The car is very affordable, nice, and fun to drive of course.  It does not give a good milege on roadways but on highways it does pretty well.

 Car scores huge on all points there.

I reccomend the ES manual with no extra options.
CVT is for the lazy, and it adds a lot to the price of the car. 

It has a growly engine sound (I find this a positive not a negative).
Handling can be improved greatly by adding a $200 rear sway bar. Styling is so so.
Interior is hard plastic but seems like there is very little to break.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,dparris99, 01/04/2014,2014 Mirage ES CVT - Gets better with age!,5,"Mirage ES w/ CVT automatic, and Navigation. Excellent car, 62975 miles to date. Fuel economy- I average 44 to 52 MPG summer, 38 to 44 winter, mixed city / highway driving. In summer I've gotten over 60 MPG on longer trips at a steady 55 MPH, 72 MPG at steady 45 NPH. When new, MPG improves gradually as the car gets more miles on it, until 40K then stays the about the same. Ride, handling, and braking also improve gradually with use; German cars I've owned were like that. Great in snow, even without switching to winter tires. 6"" is deepest snow driven in so far. On glare ice the electronic traction controls are impressive.  Maintenance / Repairs - in 3 years I've had to replace one headlight bulb ($9.00). Though not necessary, I also changed fluid in the CVT transmission, installed iridium tip spark plugs, and added a K&N air filter element (clean/re-use type). In sub-zero degree weather the car cranked slowly so the 3rd year in fall I replaced the battery with a more powerful one (500 CCA). Replaced front brake rotors and pads at 62K miles, did myself, quick and easy, parts were $145.00 from NAPA Auto Parts. Other than that, just wash, wax, vacuum the interior,  rotate & balance tires, change oil & filter every 10K miles. Seats are very comfy even on long trips (e.g Madison WI, to St. Loius, MO and back, in one day) though at 50K miles I noticed padding on drivers seat cushion is less supportive than it had been. In general the interior is comfortable, and  well laid out, Controls are sensibly located, intuitive, and I'm 5' 10"" and 160 lb. yet it is easy for me to enter / exit the car, has plenty of headroom, shoulder room, and legroom. Seat base is height adjustable, very helpful. Great for parallel parking - small, short turning radius, and it has a backup camera. The tires show moderate wear at 63K miles and seem to have better traction than when new. I highly recommend this car, new or used, and you can get a nice used one at a great price if you shop online. That is because resale value isn't great, which may change as word gets around that these are great little cars, but until that that happens I'd say don't buy a new one if you don't plan to keep it for at least 5 years.

I, too came from a Nissan Versa, and while that was cheaper, it didn't get anywhere near this mileage.
I'm able to get it up to 56 mpg if I drive it right, and that's on the hilly back roads of NH.

I took lots of road trips through faLl .. Went camping .. Which we had a massive rain storm roads were flooded trees down .. That little car drove right over branches and through deep puddles zero issues. My mom is disabled having several spinal fusions she can't turn her head and her arms, neck and shoulders are in constant pain she LOVES my little Purpink (that's what I call her) we raised the seat up so its easier for her to get in and out it definitely doesn't feel like a tiny car you don't feel like you're sitting on the road and when the seat is raised it sits like an SUV. The steering wheel initially feels loose it takes small inputs to move it .. Once you get used to it every other car feels like so much effort to drive .. And I nearly take out curbs etc in other vehicles as I'm uSed to the tight turns Purpink can make with minimal effort .. My mom drives my car with ease .. She's even taken several 12+ hr road trips with me which she never thought she'd be able to do but Purpink is so comfortable and easy to drive. I'm 5'9"" and a large person my family/ friends etc are also 5'9"" or taller and no one is skinny everyone fits great .. We don't even have to touch in the front seat .. My friends who have ridden in back say it's not bad ..  I drove from wi to NY and back over the winter we spent more on tolls .. than gas .. On the way home we hit a 6 hr snow storm throug Ohio cars were spinning off the road .. We were totally fine .. Kept my speed down and she drove as well as my AWD suv.  This summer my friend and I spent 10 days exloring colorado .. All our camping gear, tents, cooler, etc us two large suitcases fit just fine without blocking any windows. We spent the majority of time on gravel roads and remote camping we drove up and down a nearly straight up and down rut covered dirt hill to get to our campsite on the river even pick up trucks had an issue making it .. We just went.. Up and down it repeatedly zero
Issues .. People kept staring at her all amazed that she could even make it there and she did it with ease .. I LOvE this car .. Even my guys friends and brother love my tiny purpink car.  Only thing is change is a center console/ arm rest for comfort and much needed storage for small things .. Plenty of cup holders tho

This is not a Cadillac, Lexus or Mercedes, and it's not a BMW or Corvette. So don't expect the luxury and handling you would get in one of those vehicles. Having come out of some very nice vehicles, this one is pretty impressive considering the price and the gas mileage.

At Western US highway speeds, 70 to 75 mph, with full load and air conditioner in the summer 16.6 km/l (39 mpg).  A bit over-powered for fuel efficient car.  Can climb a 6% grade at 120 km/h (75 mph) with a full load at 1700 m (5600 ft) elevation Â with alacrity.  Engines achieve best efficiency just below maximum power, so most of time it is operating with lower efficiency.  Feat requires over 50 kW (66 hp) so engine probably exceeds 56kW (74 hp) rating.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,sdaigle, 01/03/2015,Quirky and Charming,3,"*UPDATE 7.26.17""
My Mirage was totalled in a rear end accident back in March. Mileage was right around 56k. Nothing new to report on reliability or quality.

*UPDATE 1.26.17*
I've owned my Mirage now for over 3yrs and 52k miles. Still loving it. With that said, It's having first model year teething problems. On warm, humid days (rain or not), the car idles erratically upon startup with a cold engine. The RPMs ""bounce"" by a couple hundred RPM. It goes away once I put the car in gear and doesn't return until the next warm, humid day I start the engine cold. The other engine-related concern is a horrible rattling noise from the engine at startup when cold. It only lasts 1 to 2 seconds after startup. I've heard of some Mirage owners having to have their engine replaced under warranty. I'm wondering if my engine will become one in time. Thank goodness for the 100k mile warranty! From what I read, this is a common complaint with the 2014 models. The only other issue worth mentioning, which is also a common complaint, is that the glove box door rattles on rough pavement. It ""chatters"". Very annoying, but not a real problem. The issue being that the glove box door does not latch tightly enough due to the use of soft plastic that wears out quickly causing sloppiness. Otherwise, everything works like-new and the car drives well. My biggest complaints to date are still unchanged.

*ORIGINAL REVIEW* I stepped down to this car from a 2012 Nissan Versa SV sedan. That's my basis for comparison. I don't have a lead foot and quickly adjusted to having only 74hp in the Mirage. I find the power adequate...unless the air conditioning is on or I have to accelerate from 0 to 45+mph with the flow of traffic. This little car just can't accelerate fast enough to keep up without pushing the engine hard. Running the A.C. saps a lot of power from the engine. On the plus side, the auto climate control and AC work great, even in Florida heat.

I have to be frank about the transmission. It's pretty terrible. It clunks upon initial acceleration. It clunks when coming to a stop. While accelerating, it revs the engine unnecessarily high. I've discovered if I let off the throttle a bit, then lay back into the throttle, it corrects itself and provides more thrust with lower RPMs. I thought this is just life with a CVT. The CVT in my Versa was terrible as well, but for different reasons. Then I drove my Mom's 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and was extremely impressed with the behavior of its CVT. Always delivers power in a silky smooth manner. No clumsiness and seems to put the power to the wheels much more efficiently. This put into perspective just how unrefined the Mirage CVT is.

The ride is very comfortable due to the softly tuned suspension. Unfortunately, the handling is sloppy as a result. Contributing to the poor handling is the overly light and very slow steering response. It's only bothersome to me when driving on curvy country roads when it's most apparent. Thankfully, I live in a more urban area now where it's not an issue for me. Speaking of which, this car is ideal as an urban runabout. Incredibly tight turning radius and its tiny size fits anywhere.

The interior is fairly attractive and quite comfortable. Great ergonomics. Comfy seat and driving position. Controls are large, well-labelled, and logical in operation. My only interior complaint is that everything in the gauge cluster glows orange. Orange needles on orange dials. Looks bland and cheap. Very happy they corrected this for 2017. Otherwise very happy with the interior. Interior build quality is quite solid overall. No squeaks or rattles, except the rattling glove box mentioned above. The only other issue is the passenger airbag cover doesn't fit properly. I had it replaced under warranty and it still doesn't look right.

I'm terms of problrms, an airbag sensor failed causing the airbag
 light to come on. The rest wheels have poor alignment. It turned out to be a defective fear axle, which is a common problem on this car. Otherwise, the overall quality of the car is proving pretty good. MUCH better than my Nissan Versa. Read my review on that car for details.

Overall, you're basically getting what you pay for with the Mirage and you have to keep your expectations realistic and focus on the positive. Its low-price, good fuel economy, comfortable interior, and low overall running costs make it a good value for those who need basic transportation on a budget. If you want a small car and can afford a bit more , I recommend something like a Kia Rio or Hyundai Accent, etc. For the time being though, I am perfectly content with driving my Mirage. If the next generation Mirage is improved enough, I'll definitely consider another one for my next car.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,goreandglitter, 12/24/2014,Love my little car!,4,"After much debate and research I decided on the mirage as my new car .. My top reasons being gas mileage, cuteness and color.  I've had it for 6 months it has driven over large branches in the road, huge puddles and handles snow like a pro. I've tried making it slide without luck. 2 large adults fit comfortably in the front seats .. There is a substantial amount of cargo room in back .. And I have zero issue whipping past other vehicles.. The fact that it doesn't make the loud Vrrroom noise of other cars is misleading .. It goes .. Just quietly. Absolutely love my car and can't wait to take it on more road trips!!  I got hit hard 2 days after purchase..Kept all occupants safe and fought back"
mitsubishi,mirage,2014,dbrandenburg, 01/20/2015,It's NOT your Dads HOT ROD,4,"I bought One of thee Mitsubishi Mirage's, in late Nov. 2014.. The DE Model, (Automatic CVT), Sapphire blue.. For a First time buyer, It truly is a great car, Or for commuters.. It IS comfy driving, though seat adjustment/Steering Wheel could use a Improvement.. Noise Isn't really to bad, Annoying getting Off the starting Line, (green lights), though the Majority of the noise comes from the Transmission/Engine Combination, which IMOP could be Eliminated with noise dampening materials in the Firewall area(s), without sacrificing weight.. Going on Long trips, 600+ on I-40 is YES; is treacherously ""fun"",, Be prepared for the ""side draft"" from Big Rigs as they pass you, or them vice-versa.."
mitsubishi,mirage,2014,Michael, 07/29/2015,"Great economy car, but should have recall issued.",3,"Love this car, and it's decently quick with a 5 speed. It's light and flickable. Gets the job done, and there's aftermarket performace support.

BUT, there's a huge problem that Mitsubishi should be making a recall for.

The rear alignment is non-adjustable, and can't even be shimmed. The spindles are welded directly to the axle. So, if your rear toe or camber is out of spec (which 95% of these seem to be), they'll just say there's nothing they can do, and you'll watch your tires wear out unevenly and quickly. As this is clearly a manufacturer's defect, it should be addressed by Mitsubishi, and since it's affecting such a large number of cars, it should be made a recall. New rear axles with bolted-on spindles (not welded) should be manufactured and installed on every 2012- Mirage sold around the world with out-of-spec rear alignments."
mitsubishi,mirage,2014,TheCarPro, 11/10/2017,Great car for the money.,5,"The 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage is one of the cheapest cars you can buy new n the united states, but that doesn't mean its a  crappy econobox as some people might think. It is well equipped with standard features, like power windows, locks, bluetooth, automatic climate control, traction control, stability control, and more. The car isn't going to blow anybody away with performance, comfort, or refinement. What will impress you, however, is its gas mileage and overall quality. Sure, there are time when you are reminded that you have a cheap car. For example, the interior plastics are rough, but this helps durability and keep the cost down. Also, the exterior styling isn't going to get you noticed; however with the bright paint colors available, it can stand out from the crowd. The leg and head room in the front is great, and i'm 6'1"". Getting in and out of it is easy. The rear space is great for city driving, however i wouldn't want to be back there for a long trip. The cargo room when the rear seats are up is enough for getting groceries, and with the rear seats down, i've managed to get a 50"" tv in the back. It has been very reliable, with almost no repairs needed. I have a short three mile drive to work, twice a day, 5 day a week, and it has been two months since i last refilled the tank.Excellent fuel economy. In conclusion, the Mitsubishi Mirage is a great buy for almost anybody on a budget, who just needs  simple  means of getting from point a to b.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,Marcus, 04/01/2018,Barney Mobile,5,"Bought this new with every option available as a town car. Replaced a Scion xB. Much quieter interior. Great climate control.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,Eric, 08/18/2015,A modern take on the original VW beetle,5,"I have owned this car for just over a year now, and have approximately 22,000 miles on it. This car is a great value as it gets unbelievable to MPGs and comes with an outstanding warranty. It is also cheaper to insure than its competitors. I have driven this car  in all types of conditions nclude up Vermont snow covered mountains (with studded snow tires), driven on muddy dirt roads, and have taken numerous long trips on the highway. All of which it does well. I don't know what the reviewers are talking about when they criticize this cars performance. It does well doing what it was designed to do. It is inexpensive, utilitarian, reliable transportation. Think a modern version of the original VW bug. Its inexpensive, fun, quirky, and doesn't resemble everything else on the road. Being said, the car is also fun to drive. I think it goes without saying that this car will not give you the driving experience of launching you back in your seat when you hit the gas. It does give you the type of fun driving experience that is associated with driving a lightweight car that you can whip around corners, and in my opinion the car has a very nice exhaust note while doing so. Many of the professional car reviewers over dramatize this cars ability on the highway. It has adequate acceleration, and does fine at higher speeds. If you are the type who needs a fancy vehicle and a $500 plus car payment to feel good about yourself, this car will not fit the bill. If you are looking to save money while enjoying a fun little car, give this one a try.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,bigdav15, 10/01/2014,Great value. Fun cheap drive.,4,"Overall, a great fuel saver and a fun little ride.  Some complain about the CVT and its ""growing"" or sounding like ""an angry vacuum,"" but I enjoy its capabilities in the mountains and highway riding.  Driving easy (45-55 mph under 3000 rpm) I average between 45 and 55 mpgs.  Next to my old 2002 Cavalier 2.4, this is my favorite fuel efficient car to drive.  If I didn't have payments left on a Jeep Patriot (CVT also) I'd get a second one of these.  Only downfall is sudden braking with curves, but a good driver will not present them self with this issue."

Plus it's easy to find a place to park.
It's not real great on the freeway, but driving around town it's awesome.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,Bill, 04/06/2017,Buy this car!,5,"I bought my 2014 Mirage in 2015 with 7200 miles and paid $9k for it.  It has performed flawlessly and is extremely comfortable.  Get rid of the Dunlop Enasave tires immediately and put on new tires for better handling.  I now have almost 26k on it and have had no problems.  Don't listen to ""professional"" car reporters- they expect a Mercedes in every vehicle.  The Mirage is a super vehicle at a super price with super mileage-I get over 50mpg on every tank!  If you don't buy this vehicle, you are missing!!!   4/18- I now have 37K miles on it-no mechanical problems, still getting 50 mpg or more per tank, performs flawlessly, seats are still as comfortable as when I purchased it and have taken it on many long roadtrips-very comfortable, excellent mpg and will buy another when my wife's car dies!  Buy this car!!!

4/19-now have 46,000 miles and my take on this vehicle is the same-a super value, comfortable, economic, reliable, looks good and had had NO problems.  still under the 100,000 warranty-you can't beat it!!  I'll look for a new one when Mitsibushi announces the last year for this model or I have 100k on the odometer!

10/20- now have 55K on this vehicle, getting around 55-60 mpg going from home to town, about 10 miles.  NO problems and is totally reliable.  don't listen to the ""professional"" reviewers who don't like Mirages-they are super vehicles and will give you super reliable service at very low cost!!!

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,Chad R, 07/27/2020,I can’t find a reason to not love it,5,"Wanted to learn a manual and after almost buying a junker Aveo to beat up on, I found my silver mirage at a steal at a local dealer (it’d been on his lot for a while apparently). A couple small dents and someone was clearly careless with loading/unloading the rear. But I didn’t mind. $2500 for a car that I get 45 mpg in with ac on regularly. Handles fantastic and unless I don’t quite nail my take off (doesn’t happen much these days) I have plenty of power. No issues aside from a rusty caliper bolt that I accidentally stripped (had to get a new caliper). Seems that parts are hard to come by so I may pick up some wear and tear stuff ahead of time online instead of at the dealer. I’m 6’5” and 215lbs. I’m sure I look a little funny getting in and out but I have plenty of room inside. I can reach the pedals without feeling cramped and visibility is great except the small rear window. I’ve owned many makes of vehicles now and this Mitsubishi is probably my favorite vehicle I’ve had so far. Will buy another for sure when/if this one has a repair not worth fixing. Don’t buy into the “expert reviews” absolutely fantastic car for the price. Love the keyless ignition and entry.

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,Dirk, 06/17/2019,Hidden gem of the subcompact class,4,"Great lil car! Perfect for city driving and does fine on the highway. I bought mine used @ 45k miles on it for $7600 out the door price. It saves me alot of $ in gas and I love the toy like styling of my kiwi green hatch. It only feels slow at green lights for a second then it really moves. MPG is great on longer trips around town about 40 mpg. Little short trips and the mpg is going to suffer a bit. I recommend getting a center console armrest from Amazon. Its fun to drive in its own way, like a go cart. Ride is like floating on a pillow. Very reliable vehicle, just stay on top of maintenance, which is easy and cheap. Proper fluid changes every 30k miles for the CVT is critical! Mitsubishi has done a better job preventing premature CVT failure than Nissan, even though they both use the Jatco CVT7. Theyre simply programmed better and the Mirage is way less taxing on the CVT7 than say a Nissan Cube or Juke. The engine is so simple with a timing chain making it extremely reliable. Simple car, simple repairs, less money out of your pocket. Highly recommend this car for subcompact lovers.

Still a great ride!

mitsubishi,mirage,2014,silenthill2007, 07/31/2014,New Mitsubishi Mirage 2014,4,"2018 Summer
Had issues with front shock mounts. Hard to get the parts to fix it. Got rid of it and bought a 2013 Honda Fit Sport!

2018 February update:
Everything fine except problem with the front brakes not working.
There is a knock on both sides in the front.
Tomorrow I will be taking the car to the mechanic because of two broken lug studs! Oh and I had to replace my bulbs in the front.

2017 August 16 Update 2:
Managed to do 60.1 MPG stock! Can`t believe it!

Update on trade for a 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander:
Will not trade in my 2014 Mirage car because this car devalues too fast! Is worth $2,000 in excellent condition. I checked blue book and black book! I didn`t know about Mitsubishi cars devalue. If I buy a 20,000 new Outlander it will be worth nothing in five years. Not worth it! I will keep my car for now. Possibly buy a used car or Mazda CX5/9 next year. Not paying for a new car again!


2017 August 4 Update:
Almost 50,000 miles. I owe $4,000 left on the car. Never broke down except nail on a Potenza tire and busted shock absorbers because of pot holes. I have noted rust on bolts on the engine. Changed the rotors and breaks last month of July. Need to replace the wipers again. Those Bridgestone Potenza tires keep rolling! I am thinking of trading for a Outlander Sport! Installed Knight Rider light on the grill! The gas went up so $15 dollars to fill the tank!

2017 Update:
I still have it. I owe $6,000 on the car. Still with the Bridgestone Potenza tires. New hitch that I installed from Etrailer and it was hard as hell to install! About $12 to fill the tank here in Georgia. Full synthetic oil changed by myself and new air Wix filter. Doing 41 mpg lately. Possibly because I took out the fuel saving crappy tires.

Needed a cheap car that would save a lot of gas. Had to travel far in Georgia to find a Mitsubishi dealership. I was attracted by the 11,899 price from the Union City, Georgia Dealership on an internet website.

That is the price of the White, Manual with nothing, after all the incentives which I didn`t qualify.

I only got the $1,500 discount.

They screwed up the price. After I saw the numbers and calculated well I was able to afford the Automatic CVT one.

$600 to get another color/ NO
$1,500 for the automatic Transmission/ YES

I ended up with the Blue, Automatic CVT Transmission with Bluetooth.

At the end I am getting 54.1 MPG instead of 44!

The car has a horrible bouncing and looks like it is going to roll over with the regular tires.

Today in 2016 changed to Bridgestone Potenza tires, aligment, front right shock absorber (should change all of them but no money.), right wheel cover, Pyle Dvd radio, seat covers, mirror on right sun visor, new wipers, dome light died too soon and a better jack. Installed from ebay some nice fog lights. Changed to leds on the low front lights!

Tires at 38 psi.

Nobody locally sells parts for the car. You have to special order from Mitsubishi.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,distantthunder, 04/28/2015,Follow Up On Mirage ES CVT,4,"It's a 12014 leftover as as an fyi. I did my research...oh did I do my research on this car. I am truly grateful for all those owners that posted their honest opinions, likes and dislikes which were more informative than the jaded opinions of the professional reviewers. I am of the generation that wished for a simpler, inexpensive car that got great gas mileage with manual roll down windows. If I could have fit this car into that one Corvair body year I liked it would have been perfect. I absolutely love this car. I've seen Consumer Reports trashing this car (more than once). I'd like to think I have reasonable expectations when buying a new car (I've have over 10 in the last 45 years during that time driving about 40,000 miles per year) knowing what are the pluses and minuses of each so I don't know if I can be accused as having low expectations and/or if Consumer Reports has some sort of issue with their own evaluations of vehicles. It's almost as if they're being prissy about it as if they're being put-upon by having to explain to us lesser mortals what should be obvious to everyone. Well, it may be obvious to them, but not to me. If I want something that is a definitive sports car I'll get a Corvette; if I want something that defines luxury maybe one of those in the class of a Lexus, top-end Hyundai, etc. I wanted something this time as an economical alternative to the wife's very nice SUV as a practical matter. For 14 thousand, contrary to Consumer Reports, the car handles well-enough, has enough power if you drive it intelligently on the road (I used to own the original Volkswagen normally aspirated diesel which taught you to be aware of your driving conditions and to think ahead), the CVT works well with the non-hybrid 3 cylinder without the extra weight, added costs and complexity of a hybrid, has proximity sensors and a decent radio with mapping and Bluetooth. Of all things, the fit and finish is better on this car than ALL of my previous new ones-and cripes, it's made in Thailand. But then I did take the time on the lot to look for the one that looked the best to me in terms of fit and finish and took it for a test drive. Yes, it doesn't have a center console but with the space savings I found I didn't need it. Yes, it doesn't have Corinthian leather, but it saves me attempting to patch it when the dog attempts to claw it to death. Yes, it doesn't like potholes and bumps. But on a decent road it rides as well as the wife's SUV. Yes, it leans on turns and I would have preferred to have a sway bar, but not dangerously so unless you are stupid enough to try to drive it like a sports car. Yes, it has 14 inch tires and I would have preferred 15 inches. But it actually drives pretty good in the snow.  Yes, because the car is so light it doesn't like strong crosswinds and the CVT intrudes in the cockpit on heavy acceleration. So what? I'll take that for 50 mpg with the air off. And it has ""gasp"" a spare tire unlike the low end Hyundai and the newer model version of my previous Optima. You get a can of useless flat tire repair for that. But to my immense irritation, it didn't have hooks to hang laundry like on my last car. After grousing about that to the wife for about a week I ordered a hanger from Amazon that attaches to the back of the front passenger seat. All is good. As an update which was requested Update request by Edmunds: the CVT has been properly matched with the engine and is very smooth...for a 3 cylinder noise and vibration is better than most of the 4 cylinders from other cars in that class...and I test drove most of them...doors have stayed aligned unlike previous cars and there are absolutely no creaks or rattles...I have never had that with any other car and there are some really bad roads in NJ...I still can't understand Consumer Reports and other ""professional"" reviewers trashing this car...one of the few
 objective evaluations I have seen of this car came from MotorWeek...and from individual assessments from actual owners found on the 'net...I do like the ground clearance the car has consider it is a small car which works well in snow unlike a earlier Honda I had that acted like a snow plow...Third update requested by Edmunds: If you want me to say something as if it's a negative review that agrees with the professionals...oh yes...the ""professionals""...it ""ain't"" happening...no squeeks or rattles from their genius testers were using vehicles that were pounded to a fair thee well on in their ""tests""...again...when an economy car has been so railed against by a so-called consumer agency and it has worked so well for me at my age and perspective I begin to wonder if it's not the cars but the people that evaluate them that should be called into question. Re: requested Edmunds update 11/26/20...still perfect.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Bryan, 08/09/2015,"Most ""Honest"" car on the market",5,"Don't believe all the negative reviews from the media.  The Mirage may be the most ""honest"" vehicle on the market today. Simple, reliable transportation with a quality drivetrain that delivers excellent mileage. The 3A92 motor is a very good motor designed for longevity. Timing chain instead of a belt with a double overhead cam. You shouldn't be able to wear out either the 5 speed or CVT. Other than replacing the clutch on the manual and changing the gear oil it should last a really really long time. The CVT is way over engineered for the Mirage. The JATCO Cvt7 is designed for up to 150hp and the Mirage has 74hp.  Yes, with the CVT it can be kinda slow off the start but the Mirage just isn't designed to be a performance car.  Once rolling along I've had no issues with passing.  If you've ever owned a Colt, Metro, Fiesta, Swift, Echo, Aveo or any other low cost subcompact you'll love the Mirage.  Is it perfect? No.  The ride is soft and handling is a little wonky but I've gotten more than 50mpg on the highway.  Better than hybrid mileage for less than 1/2 the cost of a hybrid.  The haters are gonna hate this car no matter what.  I'll just keep smiling at every fill up knowing that my cost per mile factoring in mileage & price of the vehicle just can't be beat!

It's been 7 months now and I still love my Mirage.  It's been flawless in it's operation and no issues have popped up.  Once the updated 2017's come out I'm thinking about buying a second one used with a 5 speed.

Update #2-It's been 14 months of problem free ownership.  Has 74hp been enough?  Yes, but if I lived in an area where A/C usage was required constantly it would be more of a struggle.  Overall, my opinion still stands.  Great inexpensive, efficient car.  Not exciting, not powerful, not a sports car, just good basic frugal transportation.

Update #3-The Mirage continues to deliver reliable, efficient ownership.  27,000 miles now with no issues.  Combined overall MPG has been right at 40.  Still love this little car.

Update #4-It's been over 2 years of trouble free ownership.  36,000 miles now with no issues.  I've replaced the front tires but other than oil changes and two air filters no other maintenance items.  We continue to love our Mirage!

Update #5-Just hit the 50,000 mile mark and 3 years of trouble free ownership.  Replaced the rear tires and cabin air filter since last update.  Other than regularly scheduled oil changes no issues whatsoever.  Still highly recommend this little car for basic, inexpensive, efficient transportation.

Update #6-now over 83,000 miles and 4 1/2 years of trouble free ownership.  Replaced the front tires, got a front end alignment.  Regular oil changes and replaced the engine air filter.  No issues whatsoever.  Continues to deliver great economy with rock solid reliability.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,rooaru, 12/30/2014,The most fuel saving non hybrid go-kart ever!,4,"I bought the 2015 Mirage in Oct and I do not regret it. Before buying it, reviewers, including Edmund really put the car down. I feel most of them were unfair with the reviews. This car is no louder, rougher, or less quality built compared to other subcompacts cars out there and I drove quite a bit before deciding on the Mirage. Yes it is a little loud when revving, yes it can be bumpy on a bad road, yes it is small and compact but at $13,000 base, it's loaded enough and fun! I got it for a better price with some effort. Think of it as a Modern Geo Metro, better built! "
mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Speed-Timer, 10/23/2015,Perfect for those who just wanna get there CHEAP!,5,"I LOVE this car.  I have had it for ten months and have put nearly 25k miles on it, so I now feel as though I am in a position to comment on it here.  

I bought the Mirage mostly for the same reason people bought VW Beetles back in the '60s or Chevy Chevettes in the '70s.  Not for performance or handling, not for comfort or style.  But for economy.  The comparison of the Mirage to the original Beetle or the Chevette is not an unwarranted one.  Adjusted for inflation, the Mirage, the Beetle, and the Chevette cost about the same amount.  In 1970, the Bug was about $2000; in 1976 the Chevette was near $2,800...both of which would be right around $12,000 today.  Though I don't think the VW or the Chevy came with automatic climate control and power windows as standard equipment...in fact, they weren't even OPTIONS!

The average transaction amount for a new car nowadays is somewhere north of $35,000, so if a person is spending less than half of that they can expect to leave a few things ""on the table"".  This is not a fault with the car, but rather just COMMON SENSE!  Is the car a bit noisy?  Yes.  Does it handle well?  Not really.  Does it accelerate like a rocketship?  Nope.  Many other reviewers lament these facts (unfairly), but the Mirage simply isn't designed for any of that.  Though the one thing it IS designed for it does very well.  It is cheap to buy, cheap to insure, and VERY, VERY cheap to run.  Most critics of the Mirage simply expect too much for the car's incredibly low price point.

My 5-speed ES model was a shade over $14,000.  Could I have bought a 37k-mile 2011 Corolla with that money?  Sure.  But I wanted a new car with a warranty and without a previous owner's cigarette burns and dog smell on the seats.  And I didn't want the Corolla's 30-ish mpg, either.  Over the 25k miles I have driven, I have averaged about 48 mpg...that is not an exaggeration!  Driven correctly, these cars are almost unbelievably thrifty.  Creature comforts are in line with a 21st century car...even an economy car.  Fog lights, passive ""F.A.S.T. key"" ignition, nice stereo, Bluetooth, alloy wheels, automatic climate control, power everything, etc, etc.  I have had ZERO problems with the Mirage, and all it has needed is oil changes.

Not everyone wants or needs the classic ""A-to-B"" car anymore, and there are those among us who feel that we, as a species, should have evolved well beyond such humble cars by now.  But for those of us that DO still just want to get there without having a $600-a-month car payment, I really can't recommend the Mirage highly enough.  As an economy car in a bad economy, it truly has no equal.

***Original poster here.  Just an update on the Mirage.  It has been outstanding!  The car has needed nothing but oil changes, a set of front brake pads, and a set of tires over the 35,000 miles I have driven it.  Still averaging around 48 mpg.***

***Original poster again.  Another update on my 2015 Mirage, which I have now owned for almost two years.  I just rolled over 50,000 miles, and the car is as solid and trouble-free as the day I bought it.  No repairs of any kind have been needed, just oil changes.  Still averaging right around 48 mpg.  Would I buy it again?  YOU BET!***

***Original poster.  Nearing 80,000 miles over my three years of ownership, and the Mirage continues to impress.  Still getting around 48 mpg, and all the car has ever needed is brake pads, tires, oil changes, and bulbs.  If you want inexpensive, simple, reliable, and efficient...like I did...the Mirage is a great bet.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat, and that really is the best compliment any driver can give a car.

***Original poster.  Just under 100,000 miles now, and the mileage has dropped off a bit.  Used to be 45 to 55 mpg (averaging 48), now 40 to 50 mpg (averaging 44).  I am not surprised by this at all as it is simply due to mileage
 and normal wear (plus larger, non-LRR tires).  Mileage may improve a bit after I do the 100k mile service on the car.  Engine now consumes a small amount of oil between changes.  I wore out the driver's seat and had to replace it.  The Mirage has been absurdly reliable, and still has only required 'consumables'.  No leaks, no squeaks, no smoke, no rattles, no problems.  Not even so much as a ""check engine"" light.  Starts EVERY time.  This vehicle has redefined automotive reliability for me!  I fully expect to get another 100,000 miles out of it.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Arne, 02/23/2016,Amazing car for the price!!!!!,5,"I read plenty of relatively poor reviews by the official car rating companies, as well as relatively positive rating by consumers before deciding to buy my  Mitsubishi.  I decided to trust the consumers and I am very glad I did.  I love my car, and I am very happy I bought it.  I knew going in that it is not a luxury car nor will I win many interstate races with it.  I have a 60 mile / day commute to work so I bought it for that reason.  I have been incredibly impressed with the gas mileage, I am always getting 45 miles / gallon and much of that is over dirt roads and back road driving.  I live in Vermont and I have had no major issues with driving the car in the weather.  It isn't great in the snow but it isn't that bad either.  As far as the poor acceleration, I disagree, I have had plenty of power and acceleration for the type of driving I do.  I don't slow down on the hills etc.  I am impressed with the 3 cylinder engine.  It is a little noisy as your driving it, but I am usually listening to music anyway, so I don't notice it.  By the way, very nice stereo system.  If you are looking for an inexpensive car with incredible gas mileage and I think plenty of power despite the small engine, I highly recommend this car.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Edie Coleman, 02/09/2016,Six Months Later...,5,"Just wanted to update my original review because a lot has happened since January! I've driven to Cincy and Nashville from Indy so I have a little more knowledge about my Mirage.  I read A LOT of professional reviews and one of the many things they criticized was the acceleration.  Long distance driving was fine except I wish I did have cruise control.  My leg got pretty tired after 200+ miles in the same position.  Again, moving with traffic (or passing it) was not a problem.  I drive 22 miles to work each day and I have no problem moving in and out of rush hour traffic either.  After driving my mom's 2015 Chevy Cruze I will say my car doesnt' take off as quickly as hers, but I haven't had a problem merging into traffic. I also read a lot about handling.  Easy fix! I bought a $10 wheel cover and I can't believe the difference in the handling.  (The steering wheel is a little on the skinny side so sometimes it felt like the car was getting away from me.  Turns out it's all about the ""grip"".)  There was also something said about braking, which mentioned coming to a complete stop from 60 mph.  Really!  If you find yourself doing that more than once in a while, you need to retake Drivers Ed! My sturdy little racecar has taken a beating. I've been rear-ended, my windshield cracked by a rock flying off a truck and I've run over a couple of pretty huge curbs.  I have a few scratches, but no major damage.  Gas mileage is awesome, parking is so easy and my cargo space was adequate when traveling with my two grandsons and all their belongings last month.  The interior has survived several spills (including nacho cheese on the carpet) and cleaned up very nicely. Overall, buying this car has turned out to be an unexpected blessing.  Like I said back in July, ignore the haters!  I'm still loving my Mirage! (Read my original review below)


Three weeks ago I walked into the Suzuki/Mazda/Mitsubishi dealership (after having totaled my beloved 2004 Suzuki Vitara) needing a cheap car quick!  I don't care about features and technology and bells and whistles, I just need a reliable piece of transportation for getting to and from work and comfortable enough for my twice yearly 1,300 mile road trip to visit my grandbabies .  The dealer told me he had a 2015 Mirage with 1,200 miles on it.  My salesman took me for a test drive, but I was too busy chatting to pay attention to the actual ""ride"".  (Duh...I know! ) Anyway, it was a cold, snowy night and I just wanted to get the car and get the heck out of there, so I signed on the dotted line and rolled out.  It wasn't until I got home and pulled up reviews on my phone that I started having big time BUYERS REMORSE!  After reading the ""professional"" reviews, I thought to myself, what have I done?! (*$%#@)  Then I found ""real people"" reviews and instantly felt better.  Yes, the tires are teeny and the ride can be a little bumpy.  For sure I get blown around on the highway on a windy day (did in my Vitara too). Yep, the interior is a little cheap and no it doesn't look like a Maserati.  BUT, for someone like me this car is PERFECT!  I actually don't mind the plastic interiors because I'm a tad messy and I prefer wiping to scrubbing! I love the gas mileage, the ease of using the wipers, radio/cd player, adjusting the heat, etc.  Parking is a breeze! Mine is Infrared with black racing stripes (yeah, it's a little funky!)  So, if you're looking for a high performance, chick/dude magnet with nav systems, wings and landing gear--this ain't it!  If you want a reliable car that you can drive forever with a 10 year, 100,000 warranty that gets 37 MPG--then yes, this vehicle is all that!  Ignore the haters! Read the consumer reviews and judge for yourself.  I'm loving my Mirage!

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Olive, 07/09/2015,Forget the critics...,5,"...this little car does the trick!I love this car.  I've had it for four months now, and I was worried at first because of all of the negative professional reviews I'd read online.  It has great gas mileage, gives me a smooth ride, and I'm able to fit a surprising amount of stuff in the truck for such a tiny car!  Ok -- acceleration isn't stellar, but it's not nearly as bad as the professional reviews make it out to me.  I can easily maintain 70-75 on the highway without a problem.  The interior is great; comfortable seats, nice controls for stereo, temperature, etc.  

I should add: I'm a 23 year old female who just graduated from college, and this is the first car I've owned myself.  So I'm not super picky about everything being perfect -- just looking for a good car to get me from point A to point B.  This car really does the trick, and for the price point I couldn't be happier.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,jwbrooks, 04/16/2015,Better than the Pros think,4,"ORIGINAL  (We owned a Honda FIT for years and loved it.  But when it came time to get a new car, my wife got to choose and picked the Mirage DE 5 speed manual.  One year and 14000 miles later we have no regrets. Combined with great maneuverability, the proximity sensors make tight parking a breeze. The small engine does work hard at the new freeway speeds of 70 mph.  Our mileage drops to about 41 mpg at those speeds.  But at speeds at 60 mph or below, we routinely average true mpg of 50 or even higher.  (Note the mpg on the dash does often read a few mpg too high)  Because of the higher ground clearance, the performance in the snow is surprisingly good and better than the FIT.) ---------------  (UPDATE)  Now after 4 years and 67,000 miles,  I am still pretty positive about the car.  The true lifetime mgp is 44.2 mpg, a slight drop mostly because we have taken a few long trips pushing the speed limit a bit.  The only real repair issue was a faulty heater core that was replaced under warranty. My major complaint is that the stock tires will not last much more than 30,000 miles.  I am just about to purchase the third set at just over 67,000 miles.  I will be trying an after market brand with a mileage guarantee.  The winter traction continues to impress me, even with worn tires and minimal tread.  Living in the snow belt just a few miles from the Canadian border gives me lots of opportunities to test cold weather driving. It is a budget car, and should not be compared to cars costing almost twice as much. The current resale value is about 1/2 what a comparable Honda Fit would be, so it is not the best choice if you plan to trade every few years, but for a long term hold it is a low cost option for people who value the environmental plus of getting almost 50 mpg without the cost of a hybrid.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,douglas lafferty, 11/04/2015,Buy it already!,5,"Bought this car over the phone in New Hampshire on a Sunday afternoon. Two days later I rented a car drove from CT to pick it up and drive back. The only thing I knew about this car was it was affordable with great mpg's, had very poor professional reviews but extremely positive consumer reviews.
The first time I sat in it was after the transaction as complete and I was driving home. I was blown away on my 3 + hour trip back with how awesome this car is!
Everything that the professional reviewers say with the exception that it does feel ""slightly"" top heavy in highway speed turns as totally false.
This car is a blast! Did 70-75 mph all the way home, hardly touching the pedal and got 47.6 average mpg! It feels like a much bigger car and is way bigger than you think inside.
I love this car, I feel it is very well built a blast to drive and with the gas mileage, it's almost like driving for free! Mine is an ES model with CVT .

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Dawn C, 07/09/2015,So glad I went with this car!,5,"I've owned a 1998 mirage, still have it at 150, 000 plus miles it's still running great.   This is one of the reasons that made me initially interested in the 2015 mirage.    Things I love:   Compact, easy to park and turn around,  I can't even begin to describe how much the MPG impacts me, it's amazing, I got 42.5 mpg just city driving so far, I can't wait to take it on a longer trip to see how it does.   I love the temperature setting, you can adjust it as low as 61 and I think as high as 89, i can't remember I haven't had to use the heat setting yet (summer in AZ).     I got the ES model with the bluetooth, cruise control, drivers seat adjusts in height, I love that feature, it's not as low to the ground that way, makes it easier to get in and out of.  I love the fact that I don't have to use the remote if I don't want to, I can simply push the button my car and get in, as long as I have the fast key remote on me.   I LOVE my new car!!!!  I was listening to other people telling me what I should get etc. and so glad I went with my  gut feeling and got what I know and trust.  Plus, you cannot beat the warranty.      Now for the cons:   No center console, but I can probably fix that problem and buy something to work as others have, especially for long trips it would be nice to have that.   It has all sorts of warning lights that come on when there is a problem.  I like those, however I already dislike the TPMS light for low tires, I'm having an issue with that coming on even though the dealer just filled my tired 2 days ago, so back to the dealer I go with that issue.   That wouldn't sway me from buying this car, just an annoyance.   The back seat isn't real big, it's ok for children but I don't think adults would be to comfy on a long trip.     It does take a bit to get used to the steering, my first day it was horrible I felt like I was all over the place.  Now, I've got that figured out and happy with it.     I would definitely buy it again and recommend if you are wanting something small, great on gas and a great warranty.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,distantthunder, 04/01/2015,Professional Reviews vs Customer Ratings,5,"This is the best car for the price I have owned other than the original normally aspirated Volkswagen Rabbit diesel. My priority was mpg and I'm getting about 54 for this 2014 leftover. The build on this car is tight with all seams aligned. The CVT is not dangerously slow. You just have to think a little ahead in certain circumstances as I did with my Volkswagen. I out-accelerate heavier SUVs. This is a very light car so there is wind buffeting but I'll take that considering the mpg. Comfortable seating. No harsh vibration from the engine at idle. Better than most 4 cylinders in similar cars tested. Engine is smooth and the noise level is only intrusive at hard acceleration.  Good radio. Update requested by Edmunds 4/2/2019:  CVT is very smooth. Air conditioning and heating more than adequate. Car has remained ""tight"" with no squeaks and rattles with all seams still aligned. It doesn't especially like bumps and potholes but for what the vehicle gives me in mpg I'll ""suffer though it"" unlike the pansies at CR and the other car mags. I've had plenty of larger & heavier cars that rode worse than this. The car is nimble enough for both turns and off ramps if you don't try to drive it like a sports car. Ride in the snow was surprisingly good with decent underside clearance unlike my other other small cars that acted like a snow plow. Update requested by Edmunds 10/2/2020: Car remains tight with no squeaks or rattles. Car has been perfect. No issues.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,jiminmichigan, 07/07/2015,Love my 2015 Mirage ES CVT,5,"I wanted a cheap, but good on gas, vehicle. I bought my 2015 Mirage ES CVT for $14,119 ( plus tax/title/ect ). This is my 1st import, I have always bought American, but they had NO vehicle that compared to the Mirage in price with options and gas mileage.
The power to get up to speed is fine, no Chevy with a 454, but it gets the job done. 
I'm a BIG guy at 300lbs and my wife is 175lbs. We just took a round trip from Mid Michigan to southern Arizona ( 4600 miles total ) with our little Mirage. Now I have to admit, it needed a little more HP going up some steep mountains. It made it, but gas mileage dropped to 36mpg. Averaged 42MPG overall on the trip. I average closer to 50MPG currently.
UPDATE: 15600 on the odometer now. The gas mileage has improved. I now average 55+ mpg on the hwy doing 55mph. Getting 45-47 in town.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Glenn Scramlin, 02/28/2015,secound Mitsubishi mirage in the family,4, I bought a 2014 Mirage and loved it so much my wife bought  a 2015. these cars get great gas milage. they are great in the city and are comfortable on the highway. for the price you cant beat it. so don't jest read the reviews of those so called professional reviewers. take one for a test drive and remember its great value for the money and has a great warranty
mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Ted, 07/27/2016,I'm hooked!,4,"My little white Mirage is very economical and pretty fun to drive. I can get 42-46 with mixed driving. It goes way down with a head wind, but I usually find a truck to draft when that happens. I go from 37 to 42 when I draft at about 65 mph. I would have gotten a 5 spd if one would have been available, but am glad I got the CVT. When you get used to it you can kind of make it 'shift' and get your highway rpm's to about 2200 and save fuel. On hilly 2 lane roads I can get 48 mpg if I'm not in a hurry. I pop it in and out of neutral a lot. I also like the trans brake and really think it will save the brake pads. It has tire pressure monitors, hands free phone, high quality sound, auto, ac, PW,PB, alloy wheels and 100K warranty for $11,600 out the door! (Plus sales tax) I just went to Louisville a couple weeks ago (850 mile RT). It cost about $40 in fuel. My mileage check will be over $400! I did some drafting and didn't use the Cruise Control, but I'm a little OCD about my mileage now! Nearly the same mileage as a Prius and 1/2 the initial cost! My 'normal' commute is 160 miles RT. I used to need 11 gallons every other day in my Century, now its about 7.5! I had to fix a flat today, I was pleasantly surprised at the jacking points. The tire monitor probably save me a tire. My first couple miles is on gravel and I may not have noticed the rear tire was flat if not for the light. I'm hooked! Would recommend and re-purchase if a deer or other accident were to total it!

I still like the Mirage and now have 35,000 miles on it. I recently put a little center console in it. It was on Amazon for about $50 and is a great addition. I just replaced the factory tires yesterday. To get the 165/65/14 tires would have been $85 per tire but getting 175/65/14 tires was only $55 each. So be sure to ask! I haven't had a single bad experience with my Mirage and would replace it with another if it were totaled.
Update:
Nothing new, I still like the car at 55,000 miles. I've had no problems to date. The tires I installed at 35000 miles are wearing better than the factory tires but initially caused by mpg's to drop to 38 for a couple thousand miles. They were not the 'low rolling resistance' type. I did a little bit of internet research and found this is normal. Due to the price difference the cheaper tires will still cost less per mile to run. 
I am still running the factory brakes and they have plenty of life left. I am very easy on brakes though. My 2000 Silverado 2500 with 150K has it's original brakes!
The Bluetooth is great for listening to audio books on my commute and making hands free calls. I would still replace it with another and saw a grayish one at the dealership that looked sharp. I am kind of interested in the Kia hybrid though but do want to run the Mirage to 200K.
Now I have 72000 on the egg and still think it’s great. Getting ready to put the second set of tires on it soon. There have been no problems and I don’t notice any loss of performance or efficiency. It’s still a keeper and I would definitely look at getting another one if I were to wreck this one. It’s still looks new though!

I’m at 105K now and the car still performs as new. No issues at all, I haven’t done a thing to it except tires and oil changes. Still getting 40+ and still like it. I am very interested in seeing how long it lasts before it becomes unreliable. I’m still on factory brakes and battery also.
Now at 123,000 (August 2019) and still runs great and gets 40+ mpg. I did put front brakes on and will soon get the cvt fluid changed. No other maintenance besides oil changes and tires. My price per mile for operating this car is very low! Hoping for another 125,000 miles out of it before I have to start car shopping again.
February 2020 update: Now at 140k, nothing new to report. Still runs great and gets 42 mpg. Looks like a new car, tires wear evenly, no rattles or
 defects. I haven’t done the cvt fluid change yet but don’t notice any difference in shifting. I’m still a fan!

August 2020, 155k. Still runs great. I did have the CVT fluid changed at the dealer and I replaced the belt myself. It had started squealing some. It’s quiet now and I probably could have tightened the old one had I known the car doesn’t have a spring loaded tensioner. But Rockauto has the belts plenty cheap. I got a new air filter and cabin air filter on the same order as well as new wiper blades. I will probably get new spark plugs installed before 200k. It looks like it’ll be a bit of a job so I’m not sure if I’ll do it or let a mechanic. It still runs and drives great and I usually get 42 mpg. Hopefully it’s only half done and it’ll go 300 k economically!

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Erik, 09/21/2015,I still love my hatchback,5,"I have owned a Mirage for the past year and a half now. I traded in my Ford Focus ST for two of them, one for me and one for the wife. Let be honest in saying I couldn't be happier with my car. When I first drove it I thought ok it's fun to drive but it's just ok, the price point is right and my wife and I need a gas efficient inexpensive car so we made the purchase going these are ok; however three days later I realized that this little car is amazing, it doesn't pretend to be something it's not, it's not a 6 cylinder mustang with a shouty exhaust pretending it's a v8 race car. It has room enough for four people comfortably and five in a pinch when four buddy's and I make a lunch run. It has 2 ways to connect my iPod for tunes and a CD player for good measure. As far as the masses of people who say this vivacious little go cart is under powered, I have to disagree; I have the 1.2L standard transmission and have had zero problems accelerating off a stop light or getting up to highway speeds. That being said I have not driven the cvt model and can't attest to how it drives. The trim is adequate for the price and the controls are exactly where I feel they should be. The seats are very comfortable and the only thing I could ask for is an arm rest (I seriously want one). I have not treated my mirage like a weak little city car I fold down the seats and put several hundred pounds of tile in it for home improvements; I've taken it up logging roads unpacked, unpaved, and very up hill. This car has very much changed my view of vehicles and practicality, I don't miss my Focus, in my opinion the Mirage is more fun to drive it handles like a go cart you can do a u turn on a two lane road with out going off on the shoulder, you can park it literally anywhere, and finally they under sell the gas mileage I usually see 42mpg city and about 46mpg highway, my highway driving in Washington state is normally at 70mph. All in all this is my favorite vehicle that I have owed and the only changes I plan to make are adding fog lights and a roof rack.

***Update***
It's now been two years since my first entry to this review; my car now has 27000 miles and my wife's car has 64000. Both cars continue to run just fine with zero issues. The gas mileage we are seeing continues to be excellent and actually seems to get better as the engine gets broken in! Can't say enough good things about this car.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,RannyV, 01/25/2016,Rental Car Experience,4,"Much to the surprise of the rental car company, I recently requested the Mirage when on a 5 day vacation to the Bay Area.  After having noticed the discrepancy between professional and consumer reviews, I had to see for myself what the real story was with this car.  That, and I am a fan of basic, high MPG transportation.  My car was an uninspired silver DX with black interior and the CVT automatic and not much else.  I took the car over winding highway 17 to Santa Cruz and than back to San Jose via the most challenging, pot hole filled winding roads.  The steering and suspension isn't ideal for higher speed corners such as those found on Hwy 17.  It sways a great deal and the steering is sloppy.  It never lost grip, but I wouldn't want to do an evasive maneuver.  What was surprising was that the little 3 had decent power and the CVT did a good job of keeping it in the power band.  I've read that the suspension was designed for 3rd world roads and on my trip home over the rutted back roads, I'd have to agree.  It did a nice job of soaking up bumps and only hit the suspension stops once.  It also has a wonderfully tight turning radius which makes low speed driving in cramped spaces a joy.  This isn't a car to drive on winding roads quickly, but if you aren't in a hurry, it's quite alright.  I also too the car on longish (hour each way) trip up to the North Bay and it performed admirably and kept up with the swift Bay Area traffic without fuss.  In all, I covered 200 miles and got 40MPG as measured at the pump on fill up.  I'd estimate my average hwy speed at 60 - 65 with a max speed of low 70's.  It's an honest little car with personality.  Hopefully the revised 2017 will address the handling issues.  If you're not out to impress people or want to make an anti-flashy statement, the little Mirage is worth a look.  Were I shopping for an inexpensive car, I'd give it serious consideration.  I hope it's a success for Mitsu.  Cheap gas won't last indefinitely and when it inevitably goes up again, this car could be a rock star.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Rich, 03/10/2016,The best fuel efficient car around!,5,"Just bought a '15 brand new with a 5 speed stick DE model for $9588.00 plus tax.  Unbelievable!  Huge sale brought me into the fold and the car doesn't disappoint.  The car is packed with standard feature and Is easy to drive.  Professional reviewers mention how the handling and performance are sub par but in reality the car is fine on the road.  Sure it could be tuned to be tighter but it is fine.  Maybe the '17 model will include a USA tuned suspension.  Acceleration with the 5 speed is fine and the car is totally geared towards fuel efficiency.  On the first tank of gas the car pegged 46.3 miles per gallon in mixed driving.  I find the car super easy to drive and it's very comfortable on the inside.  The dash design is good and materials are par for the class.  The seats and auto climate controls are far above class average.  If your going to drive a small car you hope to get above 40 mpg.  In the Mirage you actually get that high mpg at a low price in a good package.  The car is a great value and I'm glad I waited to get one.  I almost bought one in the fall for around $11,500 but I waited and lucked out.  Now that I own one I would say anywhere between 9500 and 11500 would be a fair price for the Mirage.  On the upper end ES model prices can get up there pretty high and I would question the value of those models seeing that they have all the same mechanics as the DE model.   The DE model come standard with power windows locks and mirrors.  It also has a/c and a good stereo.  Look for a bargain and get yourself a Mirage.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,SuperTechie, 07/27/2015,Best for Buck,5,"In the 10K class of new cars (only looking at stick, as with small engines all other trannies have bad performance), I have looked at:
1.  Chevy Volt.  Totally rejected due to Onstar and the inability to truly disable it even when unsubscribed.  No spying is desired.
2.  Nissan Versa.  Off the line performance sucks bad, even though it has a bigger engine.  It seems like they have detuned it so that you can't peel out.  I wouldn't want to cross 4 lanes with this one.  Car is most comfortable but feels heavy and gets bad MPG.
3.  Mitsubishi Mirage.  Best bang for buck.  Great acceleration for size of engine/MPG with stick.  Seats could be a little more comfortable, but not bad.

I bought the base version as I did not want the proximity key/push button start that comes with the upgraded versions, since so many of the proximity keys have been hacked.  It would have been nice to have the alloy wheels and cruise, but I feel much safer not having the proximity key.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Kevin McKenzie, 08/01/2015,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage ES w/ Navigation,5,"I bought my 2015 Mirage ES with Navigation about 2 weeks ago and had to make a 3 hour drive back home from the dealer on I-495 (belt way) and had no issues going 75mph and keeping up with traffic.  I averaged 50mpg on the drive back.  The ride is amazingly smooth for such a small car!!!  I love the Navigation and Back Up Camera that I got as the $900.00 option package and it also has the $695.00 Sport Appearance Package which really makes it look sharp.  My co-worker purchase a 2015 ES with Navigation back in November 2014 and 5,000 miles later not one issue we both love our Mirage's!!!  I got mine in Starlight Silver and my co-workers is Infared.  The Interior is really spacious and the trunk is very roomy!!!  I had my choice of many cars and I knew hands down this was the car for me and I couldnt be happier.  All of the negative reviews this car has is just plain stupid.  It is full of features, power windows, locks, mirrors, push button start, navigation, back up camera, cd, dvd, automatic climate control, fog lights, fast key with keyless start, button access, ABS, Hill Hold Assist, TC, Stability Control and much much more!!!  You cant go wrong with any Mirage!!!!

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,YRLY59E@aol.com, 05/10/2016,"Great little car, critics aren't always right",4,"Critics hate this car. Critics aren't always right. A lot of critical reviews of this car malign the handling and ride. First the handling feels somewhat detached, but it is precise. Critics tend to want cars to handle like a sports car, which is fine if you're driving short distances and limited amounts of time but it becomes fatiguing over time. The nice easy steering and soft suspension make this great for long commutes. I can drive this longer distances than my Fusion without feeling stiff. It is a very comfortable car for its size to drive a long distance. Seats are decently comfortable. I'm not exactly a small guy and I typically drive larger stuff like say a Grand Marquis or F150. I'd even call it enjoyable to drive. If I had to say anything negative, the biggest drawback is acceleration.

I hear a lot of complaints about the road noise. While the engine isn't terribly refined the factory supplied tires are geared towards economy, so they're noisy. Once they wear out and you put some softer touring tires on or ones with better tread pattern, it would be a lot quieter. I've noticed that on the right highway surface even at higher speeds it's fairly quiet in terms of wind noise. 

The car offers a lot for the money. When you compare what you get for the money you get more features with the Mirage and a better warranty. Like your Bluetooth, automatic climate control, automatic transmission, push button start, power locks, power windows, power mirrors for driver and passenger sides, AC? Imagine getting all of them for under $12000, including fancy rubber floor mats, unnecessary chrome highlight package and alloy wheels.

Fuel economy will easily best it's rated number with the CVT, my wife and I took a road trip over hilly terrain last week and got 48mpg with the AC on (which has climate control too).

Serviceability of the engine compartment is good, there is plenty of room, the design is straightforward.

Cargo capacity is quite good if you fold the seats down. The rear seat is serviceable if needed.

While it has some quirks the controls are easy to use and adjust to. The cruise control and the radio controls on the steering wheel took the most adjusting as did the rear wiper (but I only own one other vehicle with a rear wiper and it's an 88 Aerostar).

Given the fact you can put yourself in a new one for less than the cost of almost any new car, many used ones and given its long standard warranty, it deserves more of a look. It offers fantastic fuel economy and great options for the cost. This is an excellent starter car for a first time driver (they won't be able to drag race), or just a sensible extra car with a great warranty.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,robert Sherman, 09/27/2015,Hated it at first..luv it over a year later!! :-),5,"I bought this car for it's excellent gas mileage and with a 74 hp engine didn't expect much..this little car can and will move and move fast..if your not afraid to drive it!! I have had it 36 months now and hv 42k miles on it.. and it has been 100% reliable..for what it is Im very happy..great little economy/commuter car..one thing I was shocked to see..it has a timing chain instead of a cheap rubber belt like most new cars now days have..this car might not be the best looking or best performing. But it definitely 100% gets the job done..still surprised at how zippy it is..it will flat out move if I'm not payn attention to speedo I'll be on highway outside of town doin 90/95 and not even know it. Says 140mph on speedo and I can confirm I was almost there once. Just to see if it could. I got scared and let off at 120mph..but still had not bottomed out my pedal. I had those squirrels workn hard!! Lol

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Dane, 09/29/2016,After one month with a 2015 Mirage CVT,5,"I started looking for small cars with great gas mileage when my 14 year old Hyundai Sonata hit 180,000 miles and I knew I was going to start facing some significant repair costs. I liked the Chevy Spark but it was almost impossible to find one in the $8,500 or less range that hadn't been used as a rental. I liked the Honda Fit and the Toyota Yaris, but anything in that price range seemed to always have at least 50,000 miles on it. I Briefly looked at a Smart Fortwo with less than 10,000 miles on it, but just couldn't bring myself to take that kind of size hit. I saw a 2015 ""Sapphire blue"" Mitsubishi Mirage with 14,000 miles on it. After a test drive and a little dickering I got it out the door at $8750. Here are my thoughts after 30 days with the Mirage. Is it as loud, slow, and unresponsive as the professional reviewers have labeled it? No. It's louder, slower, and less responsive than my old Sonata was, but it also gets almost exactly twice the miles per gallon. The key to owning the Mirage is all in expectations. If you're expecting a car that gets 45 mpg while still being able to do a 9 second quarter, handle like it's on rails and haul you and 4 other people around at 75 mph in the quiet comfort of a Mercedes 500 series, I'm thinking you may have a long search for your next car. My Mirage has had no trouble getting on highway entrance ramps at 35 mph, then accelerating to 65 by the end of the ramp in order to merge with traffic. Does it accelerate like my 6 cylinder Hyundai? No, but I've never had to put my foot to the floor to get it up to speed like some reviewers claim either. I do occasionally find myself checking to make sure all my windows are completely up when I'm doing 65-70 because there's a bit more wind noise than I'm used to, but it's not like it's loud enough to affect a conversation, or listening to the stereo. And of course the bottom line for me is that I'm getting 45 mpg consistently in real world driving with this car, which saves me almost 1/3 of my monthly car payment in gas over what I was spending with the Sonata. Now if I can get 185,000 miles of trouble-free driving on the Mirage like I did on the Sonata, I'll be more than thrilled with my purchase. One side note- the CVT transmission does take a little getting used to. The absolute key to this transmission is keeping your right foot steady. Slow, steady increases in accelerator pressure lets the CVT rev the engine up smoothly and relatively quickly, and then drop down the same way. Hitting the accelerator hard gives you the ""rubber band effect"" where your engine revs but you don't accelerate for a second, then suddenly catch up. The CVT also has an odd habit of ""clunking"" slightly when you come to a complete stop before the car settles into a fairly smooth idle. My opinion of the 2015 Mirage after 30 days is that this company did an amazing job engineering a car to get 45 mpg while still letting a person drive normally, in reasonable comfort.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,My Kermit, 02/15/2016,Professional Reviewers??,5,"I too read the professional reviews then on youtube  I decided to view MOTORWEEK's review of this car as they have been honestly reviewing cars for over 30 years as they too had qualms about this car which totally changed when the review was complete! This is one awesome little car! I really love my KIWI GREEN little Kermit! For a 3 cyl car it has plenty of pep! The fuel economy is nothing short of spectacular! I have never owed a car that got 40(+) mpg mind you in city driving. It fits everywhere. For the price with the rebates plus the warranty & Mitsubishi's reliability you can not go wrong! I just can not figure out why people go with the other Japanese car companies when this is Japan's real secret!! The handling is fine, the ride is fairly smooth as the car easily fits my 2 dogs, 2 kids, me & my wife. For the price of the DE I bought the car is well-equipped with A/C w/auto control, A/T, Tilt, AM/FM CD, Blue Tooth, Electric Remote Mirrors, P/S, P/B, ABS
P/W, 7 air bags plus so much more!! The Mirage is anything but a mirage...you won't go wrong!!!

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Rachel K, 01/18/2016,Great Car in a small package,5,"If you are looking for all the bells and whistles you should look elsewhere, but if you want a great warranty, reliability, fuel economy, and easy parking this is the car for you.  I had a Ford Escort back in the day and loved it.  Eventually got a Ford minivan but my kid toting days are over.  I don't haul a lot of stuff and I have no kids at home, so this car was great.  I take long road trips and the fuel economy is great.  52 mpg at some points.  Costs me very little in gas and now that I am experiencing my first Erie, PA lake effect winter in this car I am loving it.  I was very afraid of getting stuck but bought my snow tires in October and have not been stuck yet.  I didn't even shovel this morning after a 4-6 inch snow storm and got out of my driveway without a hiccup.  My Chevy Malibu I traded in for this car was stuck all last year.  No snow tires, but it was a heavier car.  Gas mileage on that was horrible and the interior was cheap and plastic.  And I paid more for that car even with it being 3 years old.  This was a brand new car with a 5 year 60,000 mile basic warranty.  Compare that to the normal 3 year 36,000 mile on most cars.  That was the biggest selling point.  I could afford a brand new car with no worries for 5 years and have no car payments.  It's small but very much a great car.  Go ahead and pay more for the Chevy Cruze (which has nothing on it for their base price) and see the cheapy plastic interior and how many times you need it serviced.  And our Mitsubishi dealer here in Erie could not be better.  They get 5 stars.  Gave me a loaner for an oil change.  Who does that?  They treat you as well as the person who bought a $30,000 car.  The Mirage is not the fanciest car, but it does the job and does it well.  No complaints here.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Jerry Smith, 11/25/2015,This is a great extra car.,4,"This car is great basic transportation. After adjusting my driving habits from a 300 Hp ride to a 74 Hp economy car I have no complaints. All cars have different handling characteristics and should be driven accordingly. While this car is capable of doing just over 100mph I recommend keeping it under 75mph. I did add some spring stiffness blocks to the rear springs and handling improved significantly. I do not know why the professional ratings are lower than consumers. They are either out of touch or do not have realistic expectations when it comes to basic transportation.

"
mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Keith, 08/09/2016,Incredible value.,4,"I went in to look at the 2017 model, but found that they had a 2015 leftover buried on the lot. It took a while for them to get it out (they didn't know they had it). It turned out to be a CVT (I wanted a stick) ,but I took it out anyway. After reading all the negative PROFESSIONAL reviews, I however was very impressed. (The so-called PROS act like this is the worst thing since the black plague.) It has plenty of room ,it drives well ,rides good, handles well, sure it's all hard plastic inside, but it looks good and seems to be put together pretty good. Yes it does have some tire noise, and wind noise. But it is no more intrusive than some other cars I've had ( focus). Acceleration (lol) is rather leisurely. It has PW,PL,PM,CVT,TRAC. CONTR.,ABS,CLIMATE CONTROL,NICE STEREO W/ USB CON.plenty of cargo room ,good room for 4 adults (5 no way) and a great warranty. I decided to go for it. It had 41 miles on it, sticker was $14,905 (too much, it is 2 model years old after all, there was no 2016). After some minor back and forth I was out the door at $9,400!!!!!!!!!!!. For a brand new car? Amazing!!  I have since driven the car over 2,000 miles and I like it even more. The CVT takes some getting used to, but I'm adjusting. I'm getting 38-43 mpg without trying. No it's not a Lexus, but it's not meant to be . It's basic transportation at a good price. I didn't drive the 2017 (it's supposed to be better) I don't know. DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING THE PROFESSIONALS SAY. Try it for yourself, it might not be your cup of tea. But it might impress you. If you can get a good deal go for it. I hope this will help you make an educated decision. I went in ready to hate, but came out with a car . Good luck with your search.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Meghan Puente, 10/14/2015,Great bang for the buck,4,"I bought this little Mirage DE in Mystic Black with the 5SPD and I couldn't of been happier. With rebates (Previous Mitsu owner, year end rebates, rebate from my job being partners with Mitsu) My final price was just over $11,000. Only option was blue tooth.
 
Good:
I drive 75 miles a day, so gas mileage was important, I average 42 mpg highway/traffic, and I don't have a light foot. trying to drive conservatively and a long highway trip I actually reached almost 52 mpg. As long as you stick in your lane and don't feel like you need to weave in and out of traffic, it keeps up just fine. 
The seats are supportive, and the ride is comfortable enough. I am 5'11"" and there is plenty of headroom. The piano black trim inside helps break up the matte black plastic so it doesn't look that bad. I do like how this car has 7 airbags and climate control.
10 year/100k mile powertrain warrantee and free oil changes for life are a plus from Mitsubishi.

Bad:
Suspension is soft though and some has some body roll. I wish the car came with a armrest. The Bluetooth works but when I play music through it, Pandora from my phone, the sound is low quality/tingy (AUX cable works better and my music sounds better then Bluetooth). Also I have the Bluetooth that is not apart of the steering wheel. Learning to use the Bluetooth button on the dash is like learning morse code. You have to press it once, twice, three times, hold for one , two, three, three seconds all to do 6 or more different functions. I just stopped using it for music, just to take calls. 

If you get the DE model, make sure you can live with the seat not being able to adjust up and down. I am 5'11"" and where it is at is ok, but any taller, I think it would be inconvenient. 

Overall: This is a fun little car to drive, you wont win any races but for the price, gas mileage, great warrantee, its worth it. Critics seems to be harsh on this car, but then again they are not usually concerned with the fact some people just want basic car that is reliable, and get them to work/school and back, and are not trying to set amazing lap times on a race track.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Conor, 01/30/2016,Great little car with even better mileage!,5,"OK, this car probably isn't for everyone but it is a great car for those who want a basic and reliable vehicle.  Forget about what the ""professional"" and ""expert"" reviewers say.  Not everyone wants all the frills in the world and some like us view them as a negative.  Not everyone wants a touch screen to control every system in the car.  If you are this way then this car is worth a look.  My girlfriend's old car recently started having issues with needing one repair after another and then 3 major ones hit at once and the cost of doing all these would have been about double the value of the car.  It was time to move on and get her a new car.

She wanted a basic small subcompact.  I had been looking into these as I do a lot of driving and like small cars like this for the handling and economy.  All the owners had nothing but good things to say about them.  We looked at several other cars but she didn't fall in love with any of them.  I thought the low cost, features, and warranty of the Kia Rio were good but she didn't like the car.  It had too many features such as a touch screen and the like that she didn't want.  It was love at first sight with this one.  It had basic intuitive controls that were easy to operate and the manual transmission model drove smooth and has plenty of power.  We did not test drive the automatic/CVT model.  I see other reviews categorizing this car as sluggish so maybe they are reviewing that transmission option.  The transmission in this one has appropriate gear ratios and has plenty of power.  The engine is TIMING CHAIN driven which is almost unheard of in a cheap 3 cylinder car like this one and has variable valve timing which produces a nice flat torque curve.  The engine is being further improved in 2017 with the addition of roller lifters/cams for slightly more power and economy.  Some engineering went into this one.

The car has room for 4 adults and doesn't bog down with the extra weight.  You wouldn't take a long vacation in this car with 4 people but there is room for a suitcase or two in the back hatch.  You could also fit several file boxes back there.

The car has one of the longest warranties in the industry.  It meets or exceed that of Kia/Hyundai in every category.  It is also great on gas.  We seem to get around 36 in town and 48-50mpg on the highway.  I suspect this might improve as the engine breaks in more.  Again, this little guy has plenty of power.  I drove it home on the interstate and it didn't slow down on even some pretty large hills.  I was maintaining speed and passing trucks in 5th gear without even really pushing it.  The ""Eco"" light never even went off.  Apparently this car switches to a more aggressive tuning that isn't as good on gas when you really punch it and this light goes off.

The engine is a little loud during acceleration but this isn't the end of the world.  It definitely idles very smooth which wasn't the case for past 3 cylinder cars that shake quite a bit.  Obviously the engine is better balanced.

The interior isn't fancy but simple which is appealing if you ask me.  Not everyone wants a complex touch screen to turn on the ventilation, radio, and more.  No, this isn't a fancy car and there are other good competing options you should look at for other cars in this price range compared to cars of this segment in decades past.  The Kia Rio certainly fits the bill.

This was purchased at Springfield Mitsubishi/Springfield Imports in Springfield, MO.  I highly suggest this location if it is near you as it was a low-key experience and you didn't feel you were in a mind game with the dealership the entire time.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Dean Saxon, 05/10/2016,FANTASTIC CAR! FITS MY REQUIREMENTS PERFECTLY!,5,"Being a recently retired automotive professional, I did a lot of research to get the biggest bang for my buck on a brand new car. I had quite a bit of experience on automotive reliability (42 years in auto parts sales). I knew Mitsubishi was second to none in that category. I wanted a vehicle that would let me enjoy life on a budget, yet be comfortable and meet my driving needs. That's what led me to the Mitsubishi Mirage. I'm saving lots of money every time I travel, whether I'm zipping to town or on a trip. I purchased an ES model with 5 speed manual. I traveled to Albany Ga. to get the exact one I had in mind. The dealer there made me feel like family and far exceeded my expectations. This was the second brand new car I ever purchased. The first when I was 18 years old, now this one at age 66. I have found the quality and reliability to be exceptional. The clutch is smooth and effortless. Transmission shifter has a close positive gate. As for handling, It may seem a little awkward to start, but no two vehicles drive exactly alike. With a little experience, if you can modify your behavior, you may just fall in love with the Mirage's steering and suspension. Some have criticized the noisy engine. On mine, you can only hear the exhaust lightly howling when accelerating out onto the highway. ( Personally, I like that)  When coming to a stop, sometimes I feel like the engine has stopped running (It's that smooth and quiet). Fit and function of controls are very conveniently located and easy to use. The comfort level of the seats seem better to me on the ES model, as they are slightly softer with premium materials, and the drivers seat also adjusts up and down to conform to the drivers height. The interior is exceptionally roomy and close to that of many midsize cars of today. I think the power level of the engine is sufficient. Living in the Appalachian mountain area of extreme North Georgia, I have no problem climbing hills or passing other vehicles, but I do know how to use that 5 speed transmission when doing so. If you are capable of doing any of your own service work, both major and general  components that may need attention at some time are fairly simple and easily accessible. No professional reviewers address that.  I understand the professional reviewer's comments on this car. Who else gets to drive and evaluate every car on the market. What's right for you may not be right for the next person. After almost 2 years of ownership I have absolutely no complaints. I'm still lovin' mine! Gas mileage is unbelievable!

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Mirage owner, 10/12/2016,2015 Mirage DE - fantastic car,5,"Bought new 2015 Mirage DE 5 speed for my daily driver. Price tag was under $10k off the lot. I have 8 months ownership now and close to 10,000 miles. Only major maintenance issue so far was bad rear alignment, which there is no adjustment for. Dealership replaced rear axle with a new one under warranty. I am 6'3"" 240lbs and the car handles just fine with myself, wife and kids in the car. Plenty of leg and storage room. Excellent MPG. A little rough on the long highway trips because I have the base model with no cruise control, but aftermarket cruise is an option. I LOVE just about everything about there car but I will list the minor complaints instead of all the awesome stuff . Complaint #1 - car rolls a bit in the curves. Soft suspension helps with the bumps but the cornering kind of sucks. Complaint #2 - plenty of storage room for luggage, but no actual center console. You have 2 cup holders up front center, additional bottle holders in the front doors, a small center tray for change and items, 1 cup holder for the rear and the glove box. That's it. Aftermarket center consoles are available however. Complaint #3 - as is with most new vehicles, the factory Enasave tires don't last long. I drive under normal conditions and my tires are expected to need replaced around 20-25k miles. 14"" tires aren't cheap and harder to come by in the states although some owners state 15"" wheels can fit. Complaint #4 - standard CVT model has no soul. Complaint #5 - the AM/FM radio sucks for some reason, but the overall sound system is fine. CD, AUX and USB all work great. Done with the complaints. Go 5 speed manual if you want a little bit of fun. Overall this car cannot be beat in quality, price and efficiency. It does exactly what it was designed to do, and does it VERY well."
mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Kevin M., 01/15/2017,2015 Mirage ES & 2017 Mirage G4 SE,5,"Hello :-) I own a 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage ES CVT w/ Navigation.  I purchased it brand new on July 24, 2015.  I knew I wanted a Mirage after I went with my friend on November 19, 2014 and she purchased her brand new 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage ES w/ Navigation.  I fell in love with the little car, there is just something endearing about them lol.  Now after 18 months and 13,000 miles I still love it as much as the day I bought it and have had no issues to speak of.  I owned a 2013 Hyundai Elantra before this and wanted something smaller and better on gas.  I looked at the Nissan Versa, Chevy Spark, Honda Fit, Smart ForTwo and Ford Fiesta but none of them could match the MPG, features per dollar, warranty, and optional features.  I did not want a bare bones subcompact, I wanted all the features I could get and that is where the Mirage shines. It gives buyers the option of a basic 5 Speed or a top trim CVT with all kinds of options not found in the class.  My Mirage has basically all the options and accessoried that were available.  Navigation & Back Up Camera Package ($900.00), Chome Package ($225.00), Color Keyed Bodyside Moldings ($155.00), Exterior Appearance Package ($695.00), Park Assist Sensors Front & Rear ($450.00), Cargo Package ($100.00), All Weather Floor & Trunk Mats ($175.00), Mitsubishi Gear Shift Knob ($120.00), Headlight & Tail Light Chrome Trim ($200.00) and more!  As you can see the options on this little car are unreal & even the base trim has PW, PL, PM, A/C, Auto Climate Control, Floor Mats, Keyless Entry, AM/FM/CD & USB & Aux Hook Up & more.  So in my eyes the Mirage was the perfect for me because alot of these customizable features were not available on any of the others and for a top trim model in the other cars it was thousands above my Mirage (I paid $16,500.00 after rebates & loyalty cash).  It has been great on gas averaging  40mpg city, 45-48mpg highway and I can go higher if I try which is kind of fun to see how good on gas you can do while watching the MPG number on the gauge lol.  It has been very reliable with only 1 issue and that was my Navigation System would sometimes lose its signal and Mitsubishi immediately replaced the whole unit under warranty with no fuss and I have had no other issues with it.  Has no trouble starting on really cold mornings and it warms up super fast & these cars have a heat pad wrapped around the internal part in the engine to provide heat quicker to the passengers before the car warms up (can look this up online is where I found it).  The hatch area is surprisingly roomy and deep which is nice so groceries dont roll out when you open the hatch.  I have fit $250.00 worth of marketing in the trun with no problems and was even able to keep the cargo cover on and shut the trunk.  Now if you fold the back seats down it really opens up for you like a mini SUV ready to swallow large items!  Now lets talk about the 1.2 liter 3 cylinder with 74 horsepower (2017 models get a bump to 78 horsepower).  When ai first drove the car it felt a little slow off the line but I quickly adjusted to it and now I dont even notice any difference.  3 cylinders have a unique sound to them when reving which sounds really neat and kind of tuff so its fun to rev the little engine up and the CVT does an amazing job holding the revs right around 3,700 to 4,000 rpm if you are climbing a steep grade say on the interstate (can hold 70 mph no problem).  Even when reving the engine like this it still delivers around 38-39 mpg numbers no problem.  The 5 speed manual is quicker (I drove one) but the CVT is the fuel economy king and I chose it based on that.  The CVT also has idle neutral logic to save fuel when stopped and you will feel it shift into neutral at a stop and when you let off the brake to go you will feel a little bump as it goes back into drive for you (this all happens so quick and does not
 interfere at all).  One of my favorite features is the Push Button Start and the Keyless Access Buttons on the Drivers Door & Hatch so you dont even have to use your FAST Key Fob to get in the car (just has to be with in like 2 feet of it).  This is a super convenient feature and makes for easy access and it even has a little place above the cup holders that your FAST Key Fob is made to slot into and if in this slot the car will beep when you go to get out to remind you not to forget your keys.  We just had about 5 inches of snow the other day and it had been so cold it all layed on the roads just as deep.  Driving my Mirage in the snow with the factory 14 inch Dunlop Enasave Tires I felt very confident at how well it handled the snow with out sliding or slipping even on hills.  I guess these skinny little tires make it easy to cut through snow because I felt very secure and just took my time.  All and all if you are looking for a cheap new car with a lot of standard features, class leading mpg, great warranty and reliability then the Mirage is a great choice.  Their owners love them.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Linda B., 07/18/2017,You bet I would buy it again.....,4,"It is my opinion that the manual transmission is much better than the CVT. My 5 speed has great acceleration which seems to be a complaint with the CVT owners. I have had the car for 17 months and been to the mountains of Tenn. and up to the Adirondack Mountains of New York twice with 2 adults and 3 children and a big load of luggage with no problems what so ever with acceleration, mountain climbing or handling. When using the air conditioner you do lose some power but it really is not a problem even with the mountain driving. The car gets about 35 miles per gallon around town and about 48 miles per gallon on a trip. When using the air conditioner, those numbers drop by a couple MPG. The noise level with the windows up is no greater than in any other car I have ever driven. I love my car and have had absolutely no problems with it what so ever.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Steve, 06/10/2020,Reliable and economical as my VW Rabbit diesel,5,"I'm a retired VW mechanic and have owned Rabbits, Jetta's and Dasher diesels and all averaged 45 to 48 mpg. Have owned other makes and models, mostly compact and subcompact models, all bought used. The last compact car I owned was a 2010 Toyota Yaris, base model, manual transmission and the best mileage I got was 42mpg. Good car but discovered after owning it for several months it had Toyota's 2AZ-FE oil burning engine. Stupid me, researching the engine after buying the Yaris. Toyota makes reliable engines but on this particular engine had a design flaw and on average after 50,000 to 60,000 miles the engine started to burn oil. The Toyota company had lots of unhappy customers who bought a Toyota with this particular engine. A quick online search will provide all the details on Toyota's screw up. Anyhow, I sold the Yaris and just wanted a small, economical car. Every subcompact and compact I checked out had lots of issues. Then I stumbled across a 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage and didn't know anything about this model. Never owned or worked on a Mitsubishi product so after reading every review I could find I decided to check one out. I happened to be wintering in Florida at the time and found that 2015 Mirage for sale at a large car dealership in Pensacola. It had about 42,000 miles on it, was the base model with a manual transmission. Now I've read all the negative reports from a lot of the major auto magazines and was expecting I'd get a mile down the road on the test drive and would be heading back, handing the keys over and continuing my search. Didn't happen. Long story short, I bought the Mirage. All those negative reviews from Motor Trend, Car and Driver, etc. A bunch of bull. For a subcompact it has a nice ride, cabin noise was quieter than the Toyota Yaris I owned and all those reports about the sloppy steering and difficulty keeping it headed straight down the highway. Think maybe they had a few adult beverages before getting behind the wheel. The Mirage performed fine and it has the easiest shifting manual transmission I ever drove. I drove the Mirage back to Maine, cruising along at 75 on occasion and still averaged 45 mpg. Sure, on long upgrades I had to shift down to 4th gear but I still kept up with the maniacs on the interstate. My other vehicle is a 2010 Mazda 5 van and in all honesty, the Mirage is more comfortable, has a softer ride and less cabin noise so I could listen to the radio or my CD'S without cranking up the volume excessively as I had to do in the Mazda. So for $6500, I got a car that still had about 7000 miles or about a year and a half left on the factory powertrain warranty thanks to the transferable warranty which wasn't as much as a new model but still impressive for a used car. I've owned about a year and a half and have had zero problems. No rattles, creaks or weird noises. As for the three cylinder engine, the negative reports it vibrates to much. Sure, at idle it's not as smooth idling as a four, six or eight cylinder but it's not half as bad as those reviews. When idling there's no vibration through the steering wheel and nothing else inside the car is rattling. Once on the road it drives like it has a four cylinder, not as fast when accelerating but it's not the dog those so called professional test drivers claim. Because of the bogus reviews about the suspension being to soft, Mitsubishi stiffened the suspension so the 2017 and newer models now have a rougher ride. My suggestion, get the 2014 or 2015 model year. Bottom line. If you want a reliable, economical car, nothing beats the Mirage. And oh yes. Before driving the Mirage, I test drove a used Honda fit and a Chevy Spark. The Honda Fit was terrible. Loud cabin noise, jarring ride. Felt every crack in the road and the engine noise was loud which surprised me. As far as the Spark. What a piece of crap. Since purchasing the Mirage I happened to
 meet someone who also had a Mirage, a 2014 model and his job requires lots of driving and his car has over 140,000 miles and he's had no problems. Just tire replacement and brakes. That's it. So as the saying goes, don't believe everything you read online. By the way, I'm averaging 48 mpg and have gotten up to 56 mpg once and in the low 50's several times. So if you're shopping for a used subcompact, test them all. Think you'll be pleased if you test out a Mirage, especially when you can buy one for thousands less than the other makes. Go Mirage!!!

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,aschreffler75, 01/10/2015,2015 Mirage ES,3,I have gotten 48 MPG as long as I stay at 55 mph or less. Don't use cruise control at freeway speeds 65+ mph or up mild to steep hills. The CVT transmission is like a slipping clutch and cruise control is not designed to handle this. It will reach RPM's over 4500 and kill your gas mileage instantly. The transmission itself can not handle 65+ mph. The gas mileage has been as low as 30 MPG at speeds of 65 mph. I should have bout the 5 speed. The Mirage is everything the Geo Metro should have been except that horrible CVT transmission. I don't know what kind of highways they test mileage on but even a level road at 65+ will not get you even in the 40's with or without cruise control.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Marko, 06/30/2018,Great little car,5,"I have owned a Mirage for more than a year. After owning two lemons (an '06 Dodge Dakota and a '13 Ford Focus) my Mirage has been a great, reliable transport. It has gotten some negative press for being ""cheap"" or feeling like a 1990s subcompact, but that's its charm! Anyway, it does NOT have 1990s tech inside. It's got Bluetooth, power windows, keyless entry and start, cruise, aux jack, USB jack, A/C, all the stuff you need...It's much-lauded gas mileage is very true: I get high-40s mpg with my manual without trying very hard. (My commute is about 75% highway.) I would highly recommend the manual version (if you can find it)...it's fun to whip the 1,996-pound car around corners, and you can park this little beast anywhere. It FEELS like 1994 when you drive her, and who doesn't want to re-live 1994 in this day and age? It's acceleration is a bit sluggish, but that is to be expected in a 74-hp car. But I regularly pass vehicles on the highway without much trouble, and man are some of those drivers pissed!...I have no criticisms of this car beyond it NOT being a Volkswagen Golf GTI. I would, though, criticize Mitsubishi for trying to move a new Mirage at 15K or more. This little tinpot needs to be at a base-Nissan Versa price point or below. It is the best value for your money. Which brings me to another frequent comment: while inexpensive, this is not a car for poor people. It is a car for subcompact enthusiasts. I am not poor. Keep this in mind, Mitsubishi! End of review.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,Pete_in_Pa, 06/27/2017,Vastly underrated vehicle,5,"If there were 6 stars, I'd give it 6, although I might wait to see the reliability after 100,000 miles.  First, the very few negatives.  Ride is a bit rough when going over township installed road bumps designed to slow down traffic, but that's to be expected with small cars.  Noise level is not good, both wind and engine.  Tire size is very unusual, leading to only 2 manufacturers and lack of discount prices, but that might change as the car becomes more popular in future.  Now the good- INCREDIBLE gas mileage, by far the best even when compared with other subcompacts I've owned and currently own, every bit as good as advertised.  Attention to detail is excellent; amount of cargo room as good as vehicles that get 2/3 the gas mileage or less.  Handling/control very good.  Interior room OUTSTANDING, better than mid size cars my company has rented for me when I travel, especially in back seat.  Controls in logical places.  Easy to service yourself when replacing filters, checking fluid levels, etc, which is not true with many small cars.  A/C and heating are powerful.  Warrranty is among industry's best- my Nissan Versa has a 36k mile warranty, and after owning it for over 60k miles I know why.  If my wife will let me, I will buy a Mirage to replace her Versa when the time comes.  Obviously if you have 3 young kids and 2 dogs, this is not a suitable vehicle for you, though I can easily carry 4 people or my wife and our 2 dogs in ours.  I have yet to have grocery or other purchases that won't fit easily in this car, including when I buy enough to stock up the basement freezer or when I buy stuff at the home improvement store. When the back seats are folded down, as Robert DeNiro said in that movie, ""you could fit two or tree bodies in dere"".    Great car, really.  Update after owning almost 1.5 years:  I now have a total of 40k + miles on it, of which I put on about 15k.  No major repairs yet.  Still love the car.  Road noise continues to be worst feature.  There are some additional tire brands available in this unique size, though most are made in mainland China.  However, there is a company in Taiwan, Federal, that Walmart occasionally carries in this size and that is offered on the internet, that has been making tires for major US companies for half a century and when you can find those tires they are usually under $50.   The company seems to only do a run in this size once every few months so the tire isnt always available.  For those of you who are history buffs, Mitsubishi made the famous WW2 Japanese Zero fighter plane, one of the finest carrier based fighters of its era.  Update June 2020: Now at 58k, not single warranty repair yet, only thing I've done is just replaced battery after 5 years as a precaution (Mitsubishi says original should last 6 yrs, I don't think it's worth the inconvenience if you get stuck in the winter), change oil, transmission fluid and air filters (did myself, dont even need a screwdriver).  I will change brake fluid at 60k.  Not a single repair so far.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,mikebike, 04/12/2017,No catchy title,4,"Shopped & drove several other vehicles/makes (including Hyundai since I traded in a 2005 Elantra), & am basically pleased, but more time/miles will have to pass before I give definite final review. As most customer reviews appear to agree, the gas mileage is great but pick up/acceleration is lacking but sufficient for all but emergency situations. Willing to put up with lower cost vehicle options for steady, reliable, economical, operation. Shopped a few other used car dealers, but couldn't find acceptable color or model (ES w/cruise control) till I went to a local Carmax. They had another similar vehicle, but I paid $99 shipping fee from another nearby Carmax because that vehicle had less miles & was cheaper (by much more than the $100 shipping fee). Used money from my retirement fund, so financing was all my own. Hope to make up some of the money paid out by gas savings. As long as you don't try to do tight lane passing, runs just fine so far.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,R.Lien, 01/13/2017,Excellent little car,5,"I purchased this car because I was looking for small hatchback with great fuel economy. After test driving several other vehicles in this class I went with the Mirage mostly because it seems to be the perfect car for a shorter person...Meaning I'm 5'2"" and no amount of adjusting mirrors or seats seemed to make the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit a realistic option for me when it comes to visibility. So if you're short like me, the Mirage is probably a great option for you.  This car is pretty basic and bare bones, but that's all I need. It's not a super quiet ride, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it seriously gets close to 50mpg most of the time and my biggest complaint is that the clock runs slow and has to be reset frequently. I've driven the car in MN winter conditions with no issues and have driven up and down mountains in OR...It doesn't do great going up steep hills. Overall all, it's a much better car than I expected to get with my budget. I've been driving it for a year and a half now and have no regrets about my purchase.

mitsubishi,mirage,2015,j, 11/28/2020,Pros and Cons,3,"I was just in a pretty serious MVC with this car after 5 years of daily driving (123,000km) and it’s a total loss. What I can say is that the safety features (e.g. airbags) saved my passenger and I from any serious injuries - we both walked away without a scratch, just some stiffness.
Overall this car was pretty reliable. I live in northern Ontario where the temperatures drop below -40C in the winter and I never had to plug in this car, It always started - with the exception of a couple times (in summer/fall) where it didn’t want to go, and I had to jiggle the gas pedal a bit to get it started. Could have been due to condensation in the fuel line or “bad gas”. 
The car is surprisingly roomy - with the back seats folded down, I was able to lug a lot, and helped several people move over the years. The gas mileage seemed pretty good - I think I got about 500km per tank, but I didn’t keep meticulous records.
At 6.3” of ground clearance it actually sits higher than a lot of other small cars, but I still had issues with the undercarriage after hitting some potholes - unavoidable in this area.
The 100,000km bumper to bumper and 160,000km power train warranties were a god send so many times. But the warranty maintenance every 8000k cost an arm and a leg. My mirage needed a new engine at 40,000k which took about 3 months to come in. I was told I’d be fine to drive with the failing motor during that time but obviously I avoided any extended road trips and stayed within city limits. 
I always had issues with the brakes screeching, starting at 4000km. I was told it was because I drove on dirt roads and the dirt got into the brakes. The sound would improve after maintenance was done, but would come back shortly after. Pretty embarrassing to drive around town with screeching brakes. I had driven many other small cars (read: Toyota) on dirt roads with no issues.
Also, the “eco” mode is a pain, as it turns itself on and off, especially when braking. So when the eco mode shuts off, the car kind of lurches. I could never get the swing of how to brake without this happening, and there is no option to turn off the eco mode.
The 165/65/r14 tire size is an oddball, and they’re hard to come by, and more expensive. The car was pretty shaky on the highway, but it could be because I went up to a 175/65/r14 tire to save some bucks. However, the car did shake quite a bit over 100km/hr with the 165/65/r14 tires.
Because its only a 3-cyl, the acceleration seriously lags when you’re running the A/C. So, for the most part I avoided turning it on, and just left the windows open.
I also left the hub caps off because they were flimsy plastic and got scratched up right away.
Overall, a reliable and affordable vehicle to get from point A to point B (minus the new engine, which thankfully was covered under warranty). It served me well and well within my budget. But it’s best to stay on the paved roads and avoid extended road trips on the highways. The shady and inconsistent acceleration and braking will mean that I’ll be searching for a Yaris or Micra this time around.

Update: Still loving this car. 7,000 miles and just had first oil change. No complaints so far. Still getting great gas mileage. Averaging 46mpg with mixed driving and mountainous terrain. Yes, it can be a little slow to accelerate up hills but I've never had any issue in traffic.

mitsubishi,mirage,2017,Zach, 10/04/2016,Try This Adorable Car for Yourself!,5,"You cannot find a better car in its class for your money than the 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage. While 78 horsepower sounds wimpy on paper, it's more than enough for what you're usually doing (driving to work, on freeways, around town, etc.). It's not like you were planning on towing an RV. Also, keep in mind that the Mirage is one of the lightest cars in its class, which lets it sail gloriously at speed. The interior is completely acceptable and if you want to improve it, there are wonderful seat covers available from independent vendors that will give you as much cushion as you need. My only reservation about the car is that it is a bit Mirror-Reliant due to the hatchback window being so small. Fortunately, the car also has one of tightest turning radiuses in its class, so it can maneuver through anything without trouble. Overall, I love this car! It's adorable and not a faceless blob!

(December 13th, 2016)
Here's a quick update after having for over 7 months and 8300 miles.

I am still very happy with my purchase. There isn't a squeak or rattle to be heard. I attached a Curt hitch just so i could haul more with a hitch carrier. The interior, although Spartan but some standards, shows no sign of wear or tear. 

We just had a snow and ice storm and this little car got around so well it surpassed my expectations. I am originally from North Dakota, so I know my winter driving. It handles great. 

Now it has Dunlop Enaslaves 165-65-14 tires as standard equipment. The only other tires in this size are Bridgestone Potenza, so stick with those brands. They are LRR so mpg won't be affected, but switching to cheaper, more common tires will decrease mpg. The least amount of road friction fit this little 78 HP the better. 

I did swap out the rear springs for Volkswagen Beetle rear coils for a ride rear height and stiffer ride. Just a thought. 

Also, check out mirageforum dot com for many of us who love our Mirages. Great info and talk on there. 

Still appreciating this car's purpose everyday.

mitsubishi,mirage,2017,gary greenwell, 01/17/2018,Retired mechanic loves the Mirage,5,"I started working on cars in 1968, doing bodywork. Later I bought and ran a repair shop. Also built close to 200 salvage vehicles over a career that ended in 1999. I paid cash for the car, have carried no debt for 21 years now at age 67. I can afford to buy more expensive, the wife can afford to buy even more expensive. I bought the Mirage after researching the MPG capabilities especially those drivers who could reach 60 mpg in this car. The rear seat leg room is ample for my parents (96&92) to ride comfortably up to 50 miles each way without any problem. with my 6 feet in the drivers seat moved all the way back.  Closing in on 3 years and 38,000 miles, the biggest problem was rear axle alignment which Mitsubishi finally fixed with a replacement rear axle. i had almost the same problem with a 2006 Corolla bought new which required a body shop to re position the rear axle mounts. The Mirage axle had camber and toe issues with the right rear wheel. Now I have a new set of Ensaves and a properly aligned rear axle and can really feel how well this car handles, with no modifications.  I can go around the turn into my neighborhood coasting at 27 mph without any problem except the gasp from the wife if I tried to do that with her in the car. I have driven almost any car you could imagine including a DeTomaso Pantera, Ferraris, Jag XKEs. The Mirage is not one of those but with the alignment fixed it's completely capable of doing things on cloverleafs that would make you gasp and that is with stock suspension components. As far as resale value, I have no intention of selling my Mirage so resale won;t happen unless I become physically incapable of driving a manual transmission, at least until the warranty expires, by which time I will be 73+ years age. I actually bought another car to keep the miles down on the Mirage so it will be under warranty for the full 10 years, or at least close to that number.  Still feel the same way as I did when I first posted this review.

mitsubishi,mirage,2017,Bill, 09/22/2016,The pro reviewers are on drugs!!,5,"These professional reviewers kill me.  It's a three cylinder engine, of course it is not going to be fast!!  Not everyone needs to do 0 - 60 in 5 seconds!  The base model is more than adequate in every way for this price point.  Perfect little car for going from point a to b.  I bought this coming from a Mustang Gt and can't wait to experience the fuel savings.  Had a fair amount of quality issues with that car.  Plus the warrant is so much better than Ford's."
mitsubishi,mirage,2017,mzcoleman, 03/20/2017,Keep Ignoring the Haters!,5,"I just read a review of the 2017 Mirage on MSN and I am perplexed!  The reviewer basically ended his scathing review of this car by saying owners would not take care of it because they won't love it.  What?!  Are you kidding?  Did he bother reading CONSUMER reviews of this car?  Probably not.  I don't know what it is about the Mirage that reviewers hate so much, but I couldn't disagree with them more.  Over a year ago, I wrote my first ever review shortly after purchasing a 2015 Mirage.  My review was titled ""Ignore the Haters"" and I detailed how I had extreme buyer's remorse because of the professional reviews. Thankfully, I started reading consumer reviews and instantly felt better.  My 2015 was a very base model, which was fine with me.  I'm not a car person.  Just like something reliable.  I had purchased the 2015 after I totaled my previous car (on black ice).   The Mirage was what I needed at the time and I planned to drive it for the next ten years (or more).  Unfortunately, at the end of last month I was rear ended on the highway and surprise-- my car was totaled! (Thankfully neither me or my passenger where hurt.  The Mirage sustained a 50 mph impact which first appeared as just a horizontal crack in the bumper.  However, when the bumper was removed, there was over $5,000 in additional damage.) I returned to the dealership in hopes of finding another 2015 Mirage.  I ended up with a 2017 Mirage with all the bells and whistles:  Bluetooth, backup camera, keyless entry, cruise, press to start, etc., etc.  Whoa!  I had never been impressed with the extras, but now that I have them I LOVE 'EM!  One of the main reviewer gripes concerns horsepower and acceleration.  If I was trying to win the Indy 500 that might be a problem, but I'm just trying to get to work! And maybe it's my imagination, but those four extra horses in the 2017 seem to make difference.   My Mirage moves when it needs to.  And the new steering wheel makes handling so much better.  Yes, there is still cabin and engine noise, but it doesn't both me because I'm usually playing the radio or a CD.  Yes, it's still lightweight, but I swear this baby rides smoother and feels bigger!   Yesterday after scraping off the dealer decals, I couldn't wait to take that Pearl White beauty to the car wash to clean her up and show her off.  I love this car! And if you buy this reliable piece of transportation that gets great gas mileage and also has some pretty great options for an awesome price, you'll love it too!  Keep ignoring the haters!

mitsubishi,mirage,2017,Dan F, 03/16/2018,5 Stars across the board for me!,5,"I wanted a reliable, super fuel efficient, easy to drive and park car,with a great warranty and with low insurance. The Mirage has all of that and looks great too! It doesnt look like every other car on the road and its easy to find in any parking lot as long as you dont park it next to a pickup LOL  This car turns on a dime. stops great, handles well enough to be fun,and loves to sneak around traffic! The engine sips gas and I love the 5 speed manual transmission too. The only things I dont like is the lack of a light in the glove box and the lack of an outside temp gauge, thats it! The room inside the back with the rear seats down is pretty damn big and the front seats for me are pretty damn comfy, Im 5 ft 8 and fit just right in this car! There is some truth in some road noise on the highway with the stock Dunlop tires, but its not overpowering and the new radio for 2018 takes care of the noise anyway! I can honestly say that I really like this car,it ndoes everything more than well enough for my needs, to take me wherever I want and cheaply too!

mitsubishi,mirage,2017,Mirage Advocate, 04/04/2018,"To all of the Mirage ""Pro"" review snobs!",5,"I am sorely tired of reading all of the ""professional"" reviews on the 2017 Mirage....enough already!  It's the mob mentality...pile on!  The car is perfect for what it was designed for...plain, excellent mpg, tremendous warranties...that's it!  No, not going to beat even an old person pushing a walker off the line...won't happen.  Won't ever be confused with the lavish interior of a Lexus or Infiniti...stupid to think it would!  Is it cheaply made (to a point) and have doors that are very light and non-substantial...yep!  Is the handling on par with the Porche and Mercedes?  Don't expect that to happen!  BUT, does it get exceptional mpg?  I got 46 mpg my first tank of gas....was amazed...middle of winter in MN!  Does it come with the industry-leading warranty?  Better than Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Chevy, and Ford....Yes!  Does it cost a king's ransom?  No!  You can easily (relatively) own this car new off the showroom floor and enjoy a decade of powertrain coverage, and, depending on the miles you drive....maybe even a decade of bumper-to-bumper coverage...unheard of!  If you intent is to be from point A to point B with the least possible cost, both in mpg and cost of ownership then this is your vehicle!  Unpretentious, not overpriced, full of value...that's what the Mirage was made to do and it delivers in SPADES!  So, all you snotty ""professional"" reviewers go take a hike!  Too bad Mitsubishi isn't paying you exorbitantly to overrate their vehicle like Nissan, Honda, Toyota, etc.  Show some integrity...call it like it is!  I know REAL jobs are hard to come by but persevere, maybe Mitsubishi will hire you to detail and prep the new Mirages to sell...it would be Karma at it's best!  I love my Mirage....no payments, fantastic mpg, industry-leading warranty, and, I'll pass most cars by as they refuel at the gas station!  Mirage Nation unite!

mitsubishi,mirage,2017,MB, 03/15/2018,Great Value!,5,"I paid $9299 for a brand new Mirage ES (manual) with added bluetooth/center armrest), & it was delivered to my driveway from a dealership that was over 200 miles (neighboring state) from my home.   We did the paperwork on my kitchen table.   ""Out the door price"" was $10,153.73 (including everything - tax, title, new WI plates, etc...) If I were a veteran or current Mitsubishi owner, I would have qualified for two more rebates.   Originally, I was considering a slightly used Yaris, Fit, or Mazda2.   None of those cars would have given me a 5-year/60,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, 10-year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty, & an added lifetime/unlimited mileage dealership powertrain warranty.   Plus, I have no worries about how my car has been taken care of from day one.  It's amazing how far a 9.2 gallon tank of gas will take you.  For a small car the Mirage handles nicely.  It ability to absorb bumps and potholes is amazing.   Strong winds do blow it around some, but otherwise it handles great!   The 5 speed manual shifts smoothly, & it's fun to drive.   78 hp is plenty of power for a car this size.   I like the fact that this car is a little outside the norm.    Some professional auto reviewers are missing the purpose of this vehicle.   It's a simple design/platform that gets the job done very efficiently.    Compare the customer review ratings (KBB for example) of the top 10 selling cars in the US & the Mirage.   People who own a Mirage are very happy with their purchase.

Update:  It' been almost 2 years of ownership & 28,000+ miles later, & I am still very happy with my Mirage.    If you are looking for an affordable, reliable, & economical 4-door hatchback, the Mirage is a great choice to consider.

mitsubishi,mirage,2017,Mark Andrews, 03/30/2017,Low cost of operation,5,"It's not a fancy car, but a practical car.  The ""expert"" reviews failed to recognize the best feature of this car - low cost of operation. First you get 43  to 46 miles per gallon.  Couple that with it's 5 year bumper to bumper warranty it makes sense for buyers who  need low cost of operations this includes young adults starting out, college students, and commuters.  Not having to worry about a major repair bill in the first 60 months compared to 36 months in a GM, Ford, or Honda is a big plus.  It is the  best bargain out there.  You can get I into an Base ES with CVT, blue tooth  and fog lights for $12.5k-$12.9k with the rebate. That translates into a $230 car payment (60 month). When my daughter's used car was in need of replacement our first thought was to buy a low mileage use car, but having a vehicle  without a warranty would require buying an extended warranty.  i never considered Mitshubisi, but when I learned that they had a 5 year warranty we decided to look at the Mirage.
"
mitsubishi,mirage,2017,Tom, 10/13/2017,Just what I expected & not a single problem!,5,"Unless you like to accelerate hard and make a lot of sudden high speed maneuvers, the Mirage lacks nothing in performance: easy to keep up with traffic, stops very well and is quiet and comfortable for this class of car.   Had it up to 100mph (verified on GPS) and passenger thought we were doing 80.  And it is lots of fun in tight places!  Super warranties and low purchase price.  I drive highway miles in east central Illinois where it can be very windy with no problems.  Shopping around is always a good idea, but I bought this because it has a three cylinder engine like a motorcycle I used to own!
After 3+ years and about 42k miles there is nothing significant I would change about the car that would also be cost effective.  I am driving more in town now and the mileage has gone up slightly!  Still fun to drive.
Mitsubishi warranty is better than Honda, Toyota, etc.: 5 years 100k!  After 3+ years and 42k miles not a single thing has gone wrong!!  Not even a bulb or a loose screw, NOTHING at all!  For me such reliability is way more important than high horsepower, big tires, etc.
Four+ years now and still no problems of any kind.  Almost a year and 58k miles left on the warranty!  Tires and routine maintenance only expenses so far.  Gas mileage low 40's all in town.

This car is exactly what I was looking for. I'm not trying to compete in a professional car race, so the engine power is just fine. I just wanted a reliable, stylish small car with nice features and great on gas..the Mirage did not disappoint!! I actually got more then what I expected. My vehicle is a cool Cooper Orange color with stylish rims, push button start, review camera, heated seats and Apple/Bluetooth sound system..all for less then $18k! But the best part is the excellent warranty.  Mitsubishi is also offering $1,500 cash back so if you are looking for a small, reliable, affordable car with really nice features, then I recommend checking out the Mitsubishi Mirage GT.

mitsubishi,mirage,2018,KECIA TODD , 04/05/2018,Love my silver bullet,5,"2nd **UPDATE))**
I have owned my car for almost 3yrs now and I still love it. Great on gas and ample room inside. Hard plastic inside is starting to show some wear (but not much).

** UPDATE **
I have had my car for 10 months. I now get up to 58mpg on calm days and driving on the highway at 65mph. Everything else is the same. Bad camera and  lack of nooks to place items. Other then that it is wonderful. 

I purchased my Mitsubishi Mirage in December 2017. I have already put 3600 miles on the car driving back-and-forth to the grandkids house. It has enough horsepower to keep up with other cars on the road and to pass when necessary. The interior of the car has ample space in the front seat and even seems larger then some full-size cars. I can park in tight parking spots and turn on a dime. I only have two issues with this car, one is there are no little pockets to put things in and the back up camera is not as clear as it should be. All in all I love this car and I think it’s fun to drive. If you’re looking for a small car with excellent gas mileage (41 highway 39 city) this car is for you.

mitsubishi,mirage,2018,Jake, 02/19/2018,Best Value,5,"Bought a 2018 Mirage 5speed in November of 2017 for $9988 plus tax/license. After 36,500 miles I consider it the best small car on the road for these reasons:  The 3 cylinder engine has been around for decades and is both refined and powerful for its size. The car easily keeps up with legal traffic and can hold 65mph on the highway with two adults at 3400 rpm, which is about half throttle. Engine red line is 6,500rpm. The interior is spacious and comfortable and the ride is surprisingly smooth. Handling is nimble and secure at normal speeds and interior noise is low to moderate. The car has bluetooth/USB and touchscreen controls, although I mostly use the manual controls and just listen to the radio using the steering wheel mounted buttons. It has power locks/windows and numerous airbags, and even a backup camera, which seems a little unnecessary to me.  Cold weather, extra weight, exclusive stop and go driving and air conditioning in summer (which runs the compressor)tend to lower the mileage by 2-3 mpg, but in all around driving in a hilly part of the nation I have averaged 45-47 mpg and 48-50mpg if its flat or I'm more careful. This is phenomenal for a non hybrid car. My wife had a 2012 Prius C and the Mirage has a similar 'feel' and fuel efficiency for $10,000 less. My only complaints-and these are minor-is that the manual transmission is 'notchy' at first and requires some practice and about 3,000miles break-in to shift smoothly. (The gear ratios, however, are perfectly spaced for the engine and allow the car to cruise most roads at under 3,000rpm. The  little engine is NOT straining as one would expect, rather has a smooth, surprisingly torquey power band.) The only other minor flaw is that the windows tend to fog up in winter unless the fan is on. I just replaced the original Dunlop tires (which wear out too fast) with a cheap $40 aftermarket brand that perform well enough for this little car. The car has developed One small muffler rattle when idling that is apparently a broken baffle inside the muffler. The dealer told me it likely would be replaced under warranty, but because they are 1 1/2 hours away and the minor noise disappears over 1500 rpm it is not worth the bother. Everything else is original and working well. I have changed the synthetic oil every 6,000 miles and changed the air filter at 30,000 miles. That's it. This car has a 10 year/100,000 mile power train warranty and 7 years rust through protection with a 5 year roadside assistance. It is solid all around transportation that is fun to drive-not in a Mazda Miata way- rather in a perky small car easy to maneuver way.My advice is to Ignore the 'experts' and test drive the car! For the price of a used car like a Honda Fit you will have a great little car with a fantastic warranty.
   So, as of September 2020..after 36,500 miles the car has been trouble free and I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. It is not the smoothest, fastest, quietest, biggest, best handing car on the road but it is NOT supposed to be- Remember that it costs less than $10,000 new and it does Everything for basic all around transportation... That's its purpose!

mitsubishi,mirage,2018,M Marshall, 06/14/2020,Long trip agony,2,"Rented this car for two weeks. It was the worse car driving experience I've ever had. The car felt unstaple, going around curves I had to really hold the steering wheel tight for control. Cracks in the road would sometimes cause the to skirt to one side. Going up hill, it would make it but it growled all the way, you knew it was stranding. On long distance trips, say 77 miles, by the time you reached your destination, I would be drained. It is not a pleasant driving car."
mitsubishi,mirage,2019,Greg, 07/09/2019,Absoultely nothing wrong with this car,4,"One can get a lower delivered price versus MSRP than probably any 4-door hatchback car sold in the U.S. with few exceptions. Better mpg than Spark, Versa, Fiesta and Fit. Lower ""real"" price than Spark, Versa, Fiesta and Fit. More cargo space than all competitors except Fit. More usability than the 3-door Fiat 500. With the standard wheels, it has a tighter turning radius than the competitors; better warranty than the competitors. Better still, you can find a heck of a deal on a one or two year old Mirage and still have a very generous warranty and the best mpg of the entire bunch. The only car I've found that competes on price 1-3 years old is the Fiat 500, but it's only a 3-door and has many more issues for driving dynamics, as I own one. The negotiated lower price is one huge feature missing from professional reviewers' analysis of this car versus the competition. This consideration is absolutely analyzed in most consumer reviews, which explains the huge discrepancy. I test drove a 2018 CVT ES model and could find nothing wrong with this car in any area for driving a car for transformational purposes. Accelerating normal results in normal acceleration with no fuss or much noise. Handling was fine; suspension was fine; seat comfort is/was exemplary; far superior to my F150 and Fiat 500; 14"" wheels results in very agile and quick maneuvers in the city and going up to speeds of 65 or below was completely without notice good or bad, which is what one would want and actually prefer in a basic city car. Other cars may be better at this or that or have more appealing appearance, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with this car driving it around that I could find whatsoever, and I drive many late model vehicles. I test drove a 2018 Mirage with 20K on the odometer from a dealer. They were asking $10K. They showed me a picture of my preferred 5-speed 2019 (used) with 6 miles on the odometer for $11.7K.  How in the world can reviewers be telling us this car is a bad choice except for it's depreciation? If you want a car to drive to 100,00-200,000 miles over 6-12 years that is completely fine and gets good mpg, this is your car.

For the price in 2020 on a brand new car---it is a solid choice.  The only reason I would say to avoid it would be the harsh resale value.  These cars have terrible resale values, but they ain't the only ones out there.  The power is fine---as long as you aren't expecting a race car.  It is just loud getting up to speed.  I drive a 19 Mirage hatch LE trim on 85 going towards Charlotte and it is fine.  The winds push it a little bit but seeing as how the car weighs about 2,100 lbs, it ain't gonna blow away.

mitsubishi,mirage,2019,WJ, 11/18/2019,The 'experts' are Wrong,4,"After 39,000 miles on a 2018 five speed purchased new for $9985 in autumn of 2017, I can assure any prospective buyer that the interior noise is not ""shocking"" as the above reviewer claimed, nor does the car wander around the road at highway speeds, nor are all the other negatives by which the so called 'experts' denigrate this car correct. I'm not sure what they expect but I traded a Prius C for this car and by most measures they feel equivalent-except that the MIrage costs $10,000 less. It is fast enough for all legal speeds, comfortable for 2 people, handles everyday driving perfectly well and averages 43-50mpg depending on outside temperature and type of driving. In all around driving I average 47mpg. It has been totally reliable mechanically and I changed the original Dunlop tires ( which wear out too quickly) at 25,000 miles with an economy brand costing only $34 dollars per tire.  My only 'problem' in 3 years has been a rattling heat shield that was easily corrected.The 3 cylinder engine has been around in one form or another for decades and is smooth throughout the RPM range. The manual gearbox is 'notchy'  at first but smooths out by about 3,000 miles. A Mirage is not the fastest, smoothest, most powerful car on the road but it is not supposed to be! Rather it is a good, reliable car with a lot of standard features at a fantastic price. Go test drive this for yourself- If it is not to your tastes, fine, but do Not be discouraged by the expert reviews. The people who actually Own this car love it. If something on this car does fail, the 100,000/10 year warranty is the best in the business.  I do Not work for Mitsubishi nor know anyone who does.

mitsubishi,mirage,2019,Tony, 12/11/2019,Refined for 2k19,5,"Although the 2020 gets a face lift.  The 2019 edition is the best since 2014.  Larger brakes, sound deaden insulation, steering improved, among other areas.  We own a 2017 5speed Nissan Versa, Mirages closest competitor in its price range.  Despite have less horsepower, the Mirage is more refined then the Versa.  The Versa also gets a face lift for 2020. The reviews on the Mirage have relatively negative, however, again the 2019 is the best refinement.  I average 50 mpg, the 5 speed shifts smooth and once you are comfortable for its power train, it’s para with our Versa.

Note: I purchased a 1987 Mitsubishi Montero new, before SUV were all the rage. The Montero was a great off road and highway vehicle.  15 years together and no problems. Mitsubishi is back in action. Consider the Mirage with its excellent value and warranty.

I will update review later on reliability but all of the other issues that the professional reviewers pointed out are pretty much non existent or inconsequential when looking for a first time vehicle for a teenager.

In general, this car is meant to be that. Practical, reliable, and excellent mpg. In my opinion, the way I feel about this car, is really fun! Engine noise is like music to my ears, acceleration is poor but having to rev up the vehicle in most driving situation is exciting. The car is like a big bubble inside so the view is large to see out. I am also a self mechanic and doing this work on a small car with so much space inside the engine is a walk in the park in the future repairs and I can go on and on. Now a days people want speed and never minds the mpg. And with so much technology in most selling modern cars these days, having to worry about something breaking down would not be fun for the wallet or purse. Keep it simple, keep it real!  😎

Update*
My car had 12600 miles and it has been doing what it needs to do taking me to work and errands etc. No issues at all And easy to maintain.

mitsubishi,mirage,2019,Chris Cornell, 11/20/2019,Excellent beginner car,4,"PROs
-The interior room is surprising for a car this size passenger seats and cargo.
-Fuel economy best for a subcompact car matches hybrids.
-Affordable the price for this car is low and even lower with incentives. 
-Cheap to maintain very little oil is needed.
-Small tire size which makes tire selection affordable.
-Warranty is amazing for its class.
-Good amount of options to choose from to fit anyone's needs.
-CVT transmission is smooth and efficient. 

NEGATIVES
-The 3 cyl engine struggles a lot passing other cars or when its on any kind of grade.
-Noises you can hear everything the road and the wind.
-There is nothing super fancy about this car it is kind of bland as far as styling is concerned.
-The attention to detail and materials are no where present cheap plastic lots of gaps.
-Options can pit this car into not worth it waters very easily get the bare minimum this is not a car to splurge on. 

FINAL IMPRESSIONS 
I'm going to drive it to see how long it last 3,000 miles so far not a single issue sometimes there's beauty in simplicity.

mitsubishi,mirage,2019,Thunderbolt, 07/13/2019,Decent little car . Roomy interior for it's size,4,"Hate to abuse an ol cliche ..... But for the money it's a great car . My first mirage was totalled due to a collision that wasn't my fault after making 1 payment . With the options and the warranty for the  price financed I think it's a great car . Someone with good credit could probably get one for 150 bucks a month . One on the lot I noticed was a little over 13,000 . Basic transportation at its finest IMO .

So with all the reviews from “experts” that complain about road noise and weak engine, you would expect me to hate this car.  BUT I DON’T

I am very comfortable in my Mirage Hatchback. There is ample head room and leg space.  I live in a city that requires merging onto a highway with 65 mph zone, and I have no problem getting up to 65 before merging. The interior does not seem cheap to me.  My daughter has a 2017 Mirage and her interior looks great with no cracking or damage to the seats, dash or controls.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2017,Mikeyt1818, 04/18/2017,Best bang for your buck!!,5,"I am never one to listen to Consumer Reports. They have no clue! This car is amazing! I'm getting 38.2 MPG with mixed driving on the crowded South Florida roads. I am 6'2 and this car is quite roomy. Plenty of room in the backseat as well. Great technology like backup camera, bluetooth, automatic climate control. Very comfy seats. Wonderful warranty. Looks nice in the wine red color I selected. Decent sized trunk as well. I am so happy with my purchase. Feels much bigger than it is. And yes, perhaps the 1.2L, 78 hp, 3 cyl. is a tiny engine but the miles per gallon and amazing turning radius more than makes up for it. Great job Mitsubishi!

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2017,Kevin McKenzie, 02/18/2017,Love my 2017 Mirage G4 SE,5,"I just purchased a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 SE CVT in Wine Red and love it.  I traded my 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage ES CVT with Navigation and the updates are extensive.  The interior on the 2017s has so many upgrades such as seat fabric material, interior piano trim, seat support, sound insulation, new gauge cluster, new steering wheel, new audio unit with apple car play and android auto, 4 more horsepower and a new roller cam shaft, new suspension updates, smoother idle, fender insulation, heated seats, auto dimming rear view mirror, wide angle rear view camera (G4), rear fold down arm rest with cup holders and even the way the shifter feels going into gear is much smoother.  The updates are amazing in making this car feel more substantial.

I got the Light Gray interior which adds a level of class to the interior and will be adding the Mitsubishi Center Console Armrest for $138.95 (my 2015 had it installed).  The room inside the G4 is unreal, its huge and the trunk is cavernous!!!  I also love the dark chrome alloy wheels and matching front grill.  This paint color (Wine Red) is so unique and classy looking.  

I had no issues with my 2015 and only traded for the upgrades and the deal I got on this 2017 Top Trim G4 SE.  It was $18,115.00 and I got it for $12,714.00 at Renn Kirby Mitsubishi in Frederick MD you should really check out their deals!  If you do be sure to see Tommy Moberly he sold us our 2016 Outlander Sport GT and our 2017 Mirage G4 SE and was amazing.  

While driving in town the ride is much more quiet and takes bumps with less of a thud and the idle is 50% smoother and quieter.  The seats feel extra stuffed and the material is for sure much more premium feeling.  The Apple Car Play alone is one of my favorite features and props to Mitsubishi for incorporating that!!!  Mitsubishis are very reliable and they have been making 3 cylinder engines forever and they will last a very long time with cheap maintenance.  
 
Keep up the good work Mitsubishi because I am impressed with the updated 2017 model Mirage and Mirage G4!!!

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2017,Val B., 01/12/2018,My little Blueberry,5,"I purchased this car because I passed on my 07 Endeavor to my teenager, and it was time for a gas saver.  I fell in love with the Sapphire Blue, and the model already came with the smartphone display package installed.  I do all of my travelling in this car.  I wish it had an arm rest, but I can survive.  It does get a little shaky in high winds, I just decrease my speed some.  Acceleration isn't the best either.  It is big enough for four people without being cramped in. The trunk is huge for the car.  We had our first wintry mix and I decided to take the car instead of the Endeavor.  It handled better than the SUV.  The traction light never came on and it braked so easily.  No spinning or sliding when I took off.  I love my G4 even more!! 
2019-Still loving this car. No complaints!
2020-Coming upon my 3rd year, still great! Brake pads are a little worn and time for a transmission flush. I'm at 423000 miles.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2017,Peter F, 09/14/2017,Love the Minibug!,5,"I bought a 2017 Mirage G4 400 miles ago and am completely satisfied.  The milage is unreal... coming from a Nissan truck... I filled up after 300 miles with $19.75 of gas.. and ran it all the way down to see what would happen.. the gas gauge (whole thing) flashes in its final gasps.  I didn't run out of gas though.. and think I had a gallon left.  Road noise a little loud.. drives like a very small car but still.. for my new commuter it's GREAT!  Again, coming from a truck, it handles very nicely.. agile.. and I love the reliable BT connection and it DOES play my podcasts on Audio Blu-Ray disk format (or through phone).  It remembers where I left off!  Other cars do NOT.   I average 38mpg.  38mpg x 9 gallons = 342 miles.  More than my 21 gallon truck that's for sure!  Roomy and spacious.. like the Tardis.. it just looks so SMALL from the outside.  Trunk huge too.  Super happy.  Time will tell on reliability but I have a lifetime powertrain warranty.  Bought it at 8000 miles.

I am a small person so the size doesn't bother me. It doesn't have alot of power, so be prepared to drive carefully. Since I drive like a granny anyway, this doesn't bother me.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2017,Lamar, 04/03/2018,A Certified Bucket,1,"Maybe because the particular car I was given had sat in a warehouse for an undetermined amount of time, but I am not thrilled with this car in the least. It is LOUD, the engine, however good on gas mileage it is, makes noise - a lot. All the time. It feels like the car is going to explode when you accelerate. It has some pep to it once you've reached freeway speeds but don't attempt to perform any overtaking maneuvers or creep onto the freeway - this car cannot handle it. The engine is so loud that you have to drive around with the volume pretty high on your stereo just to drown it out. Speaking of the radio - it turns off without warning. Having the car for 7 months, I've figured out that it doesn't like being hot - you can't park it somewhere on a warm day or in direct sunlight and expect the radio to turn on when you return to your car. If you are out running errands - let's say you go to the gas station, then the grocery store, then pick up your kids, then go to a park...by the 3rd time you turn the ignition, the radio will not come on. It's dead for HOURS. I've done this several times and sat in traffic for up to 90 minutes with no radio. In addition to that, the gas gauge isn't accurate. I've filled the tank up on numerous occasions and watched 20-40 miles disappear on the digital display after driving less than ten miles total. I don't feel safe in this car, it's like driving a soda can. There are better cars available for the money.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2017,jeffman, 08/06/2019,Interesting economy car,5,"Didn't like Mitsubishi before buying one but got a great price.  The engine and cabin noise is loud and struggles uphill but great reliability options and gas mileage.  I use for stop and go and short commutes and it's perfect.  If you take alot of long trips it may get uncomfortable for you.  The SE version is nice with the touchscreen, bluetooth, and digital climate control and the trunk is big for a small car.  Just had to get my first tire they are a little hard to find on the SE model but not impossible.  The ES model tires are different.  Most of the people I call can hear me fine on the bluetooth but some can't hear me over the cabin noise but that's rare."
mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2017,Pee pee pants, 11/12/2016,It's a new car with 12 miles on it,2,"It reminds me of a 1999 dodge neon I'll edit if the paint starts chipping and flaking off the roof, but that's really the best way to describe this car, a 16 year old neon, same plastic interior, same engine sound, same cramped driver space. There are 3 good things about this car, the price, the gas mileage, and the warranty, that's it. It's better than walking, taking the bus, or calling Uber or Lyft to get around, but something tells me I should have saved more money or waited until tax return time to get a better car, but for my situation, it's what I had to get.  Didn't think about how it'll drive in the snow if it's a bad winter, but we'll see. A good first car for someone definitely not speeding around in this.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2018,CEM, 02/11/2017,2018 Mirage SE,4,"After owning 4 of these, 2 hatchbacks and 2 sedans, One was a 5 speed manual, rest were the CVT. The only warranty claim on any of them was a cracked armrest on the door. The manual is more fun to drive and get more MPG. Only problem is if you want a loaded car you are forced to get the CVT. Reviewers online hate the car ( Consumer Reports, Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, ect) but owner give it one of highest consumer satisfaction ratings among its class. Why is this? Well, Mirage owners get what this car is about, great MPG without dealing with the  expense of buying a hybrid, Great warranty, Above average reliability, Great safety ratings, Cheap car to insure and maintain. Smooth ride, VALUE FOR THE MONEY. No other car manufacturer could come close on price. Example was the Nissan Versa, its was 3645.00 more money, had half the warranty. Don't pay attention to the sticker price, find out what the dealer is willing to sell it FOR! If your main concern  is going from point A to point B no one can do it cheaper than a Mirage.  My big concern now for Mitsubishi is Nissan owns the majority share now, Hopefully Nissan leaves Mitsubishi alone !

I was not looking at a mirage G4 at first, I thought I wanted a Hatchback or small SUV, I was looking at the outlander, then i tried the Mirage HAtchback, it was ok i was impressed by the gas mileage numbers, but thought it was a bit small for what i needed, so then I was shown the Mirage G4, I looked at many models before settling on a ES with several options, I wanted entertainment and comfort and great gas mileage. Thats exactly what it offers, great leg room and you sit up higher than you think you would, getting in out is a breeze. It has apple car play, android auto, bluetooth, DVD, HD Radio. I have gotten as good as 49 Miles per gallon, and average around 43, I mostly drive the interstate back and forth to work. I also Coach Soccer and trunk space is exceptional in this car.

Brakes are amazing but they are pretty rough if you have to do a quick stop. Gas mileage is gorgeous. Transmission maybe starting to do its dirty work. This is an automatic and when im on a hill it does the slight roll back then go .. literally that just started but I've also had one other person driving my car and they are a pretty rough driver. I really do not fill this car would do me any justice in accident. Everything is paneled and plastic. I took a dent out of my car with my bare hands.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2018,Nikki, 05/25/2018,"Great for first time purchase, not for comfort",3,"As a young adult buying my first brand new car, I was attracted to this car solely for its price tag. It's super affordable, both in terms of buying brand new and in gas savings, but definitely nothing special. For a tiny 3 cylinder engine, it accelerates pretty well. For being so light, it definitely doesn't get blown around quite as much as the comparable hatchbacks. However, the interior is very cheap and far from stylish. Lots of space between the seats, and the center console is in a very awkward place and might as well be nonexistent. The touch screen radio isn't very bright, so it is difficult to see even when turned up all the way during the day. Eco boost kicks on at the most random times and makes the car feel as though acceleration is slipping. A decent purchase for first time new car owners, but probably not the best investment if you're looking for a car you'll love driving for many, many years.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2018,Susan, 09/14/2020,I'm to tall!!,3,"I'm 5'7"" tall and the driver seat doesn't go back far enough to be in a relaxed position so I get pain in my knee and hip. I'm actually average height so this should've been accounted for when making the car. A couple of times I had to put the back of my seat all the way back just so I can position myself better for my legs but then I had no back support.  When the back windows are rolled down it is incredibly loud and sounds and feels like the car is going off the side of the road driving on the bumps that lets you know you are off road and shakes the car, it's creepy the first time I thought it was the tires going flat but nope just the back window was down. No Cruise control! The rear backup camera is always wrong and objects seem way farther then they actually are so watch for that. No frills on the screen so if wanted to use navigation from my phone it won't show it on the screen, other than the camera just a waste of technology! Oh and 14"" tires! Doesn't handle turns and corners well at All!! Plus tire stores no longer carry them and you have to special order them.. also it makes the drive feel unstable and rocking side to side and no weight to the car. I call her my putt putt or golf cart cuz she is slow to accelerate also it's an automatic but acts like a manual transmission so it revs up rpms and I have to take my foot off the gas so it can shift...often. so I have to spend an extra 1000.00 for all new wheels and tires, another 315.00 to get the actual key/fob cuz carvana only gave me a valet key and just for good stability I need to put 15's for tires luckily I won't have to do any kind of lift however The dealership wants to charge me 2000.00 for wheels and tires. Discount tire said 1000.00 and they have the same warranty as Mitsubishi does. But I love the sedan look she is great on gas even with the A/C on but the engine does always sound rough.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2019,M. McD., 05/20/2019,Pleased,5,"another update:  Lots of additional miles, no problems & consistent 42+ MPG in a mix of driving situations.  Dollar for dollar, this is probably the best automotive value I have ever owned.  Nothing exciting about this car unless squeezing every mile possible out of each penny in a surprisingly comfortable, utterly reliable little sedan excites you. We remain Very pleased with our G4.  UPDATE in June 2020: car continues to exceed expectations. After a job change, I needed a commuter for a 52 mile round trip to work.  The G4 has been great.  No repairs, low maintenance costs for the first 30K + miles & fuel economy over 40 mpg in a barrier mix of urban, suburban stop and go & highway driving.  While the car is a bit loud when driving at highway speeds and when accelerating, this issue is offset by comfortable seating and a great ride quality for an economy car.  We are very happy with our Mirage G4 SE. We wanted a car to run errands locally and (very rarely) to take an 80 mile round trip to visit relatives. We also needed the car to fit a tight parking situation & have a trunk that can hold a folding wheelchair. After looking at the Versa (dreadful unless optioned heavily) & the Yaris sedan (pretty good), we drove the G4 SE.  The car rides better than the competition on typical suburban streets and has very comfortable seats.  The SE trim includes upgraded seats and fabric as well as a driver’s armrest.  The exterior is simple, but attractive. The pearl whit paint on ours is quite nice. The upgraded alloy wheels on the SE also look good and come with larger tires than the ES trim level. Acceleration is slow unless you really stand on the gas pedal. The engine drones during moderate acceleration but takes on a surprising growl above about 4100 RPM.  I have no trouble getting up to speed on short on ramps, but highway passing requires a bit of advanced planning because 50 to 70 MPH acceleration is pretty slow.  Fuel consumption is awesome: I average 41 MPG in mixed driving and have seen 50+ MPG during extended highway driving. Visibility is great, the headlights are strong and the wipers are effective and provide coverage of nearly the whole windshield. Snow traction is very good and during the brutal cold of last winter, the car had no trouble starting at -22 f and the heat was adequate even at arctic temps. The A/C is great too.  I like the car much more after one year than I did when I first bought it. No problems/repairs for the first year and maintenance is cheap. Overall, great value for the money—we couldn’t be more pleased.

I am very please with my mirage g4 se. the savings on gasoline is amazing!... leaving more entertainment money :) Evansville In dealership five stars...

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2019,Wesley Green, 01/27/2019,Down sized for fuel economy,5,"It’s small and not much storage but I drive 80 miles a day round trip for work I drove a big Chevy truck costing me $125.00 a week in gas now I’m spending $ 35.00 a week the ride is great comfortable I’m tall so a little hard to see red lights if pull up to far but all my tools fit and my son  it handles amazing turns on a dime and stops really quickly it’s not a fast off the line car but it is real responsive at interstate speed and I have no regrets about size and power down grade from my big V8 truck especially when I’m getting on interstate at 70 mph 58 mpg and in town avg 45 mph at 66 mpg

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2019,emjaykay62, 08/05/2019,Great so far I hope it will be great till the end,5,"I do not see a problem with pick up but then I do not go over 70 often and if I am passing it is not normally that fast.  I love the phone hook up with usb port, the cam for backing up, and how high up I am when driving.  My sonata had me so low to the ground.  And the mileage is almost or just as good as my expensive sonata hybrid."
mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2019,Hellopandas, 07/24/2019,Great car,5,"Despite the bad reviews about it being noisy, I like how the car sounds and rumbles. I even named it rumbles due to that. It is small, efficient, handles great and if you know how to drive it, it isnt THAT slow. Amazing car.

It is NOT as gutless as they want you to believe. I drive the Interstate 300 miles every week. Click her into sport mode before the on ramp and you are there! Yes. It’s true. MSRP is close to a Versa. The good news? NOBODY pays MSRP for a Mirage. Check out Cade at Long Lewis Muscle Shoals Alabama for the best car buying experience of YOUR LIFE. I’m not kidding people.

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2019,Denny, 06/25/2019,Has no power for two passengers,1,"Dealer pulled a new car out the lot. I wanted it in white. I wanted to drive around the neighborhood, no highway because this would be my regular commute. I'm about 250 lbs and dealer was about the same weight. When I take my foot off the gas, car just stops. Hmm... We took another one and the same effect. I don't know how people write about this car, like this is almost BMW. I think you should try it yourself, don't trust 5 star reviews. This can be scam. I go with Yaris and I will never look back!

mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2019,MirageG4, 08/18/2020,A no-brainer purchase. Love it. 50 MPG!,5,"If you like high fuel economy, reliability and a super easy car to drive, this is it. 50 M.P.G. average. It is affordable, fun in its own way and even relaxing. Everything is light. It’s almost as if Japan built a bigger Kei car and sold it in the U.S. It’s as if anime came alive and wound up as this type of car. It has its own character. It’s actually nicer than you would think. Even this base model is so cool. Power everything, A/C, back-up camera, hill-start assist, touch-screen media. It even has Easter eggs (those interesting details). The back seat on the passenger side has a hook to hold a grocery bag or something not too heavy. The driver’s armrest flips back and makes another cup holder for the rear passengers. It has 7 cup holders. I love hill start assist (no more rolling backwards when letting out the clutch). The power is actually good. I’m shocked. The fuel economy is better than a Ford Fiesta SFE 1.0 w/manual I owned. In many ways the Mirage G4 is better than that car because everything is so light and easy to use. It’s super comfortable. You don’t fight anything with this car, it just works. No turbo, no excess. 
"
mitsubishi,mirage-g4,2019,Daniel M, 10/06/2020,Great little car!,5,"I will say I haven’t owned the car long yet, but Mitsubishi will give you 3-4k off the MSRP just for looking at it, I got mine brand new out the door with oil changes for life included from the dealer for 11k. The handling is often cited as poor because of the body roll, but I’ve pushed it pretty hard and never worried about losing traction, the handling is actually surprisingly predictable in spite of the soft suspension, I actually consider the soft suspension a pro because bumps don’t feel like an assault on your spine like they do in many subcompact cars. The car is reasonably tall and the seating position is pretty high, it’s easy to get in and out of compared to most small cars I’ve driven. The 1.2 isn’t fast by any means, but with the 5 speed I’ve had no problem keeping up with traffic, the engine is surprisingly peppy and responsive, and I’ve had no issue with large hills. You can get 2nd gear up to 50 without issue, but I’ve yet to find a hill I can’t climb in 4th gear traffic allowing. The gas milage is phenomenal, I’ve averaged over 55mpg on freeway trips when I take it easy. The back seat is large enough that I haven’t had any complaints and even going to this from my 91 Cadillac Deville, I don’t feel cramped. This car wouldn’t win any competitions in any single category, but overall, it’s probably the best bang for your buck you’ll find!

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,cm0805, 08/28/2013,Traded my Gallant for This???,2,"I didn't know when I traded that the same motor that was in my Gallant is also in the Outlander.
Good motor, but the Outlander is heavier so it has no get up an go.
It also doesn't track well, feels top heavy in the curves.
Inside is not plush, but looked good when new.
Both Gallant and Outlander had the same problems: after a couple yrs the A/C goes out and the temp control knob (the cheapest design I've seen) breaks off.
The good news: 10yrs, 260k mi and still running like a top.
Oil changes and a timing belt is all I've had to do.
My Gallant was the reason I stayed with this brand... 340k, oil changes and 1 water pump.
Awesome!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,ashgad, 08/09/2009,Great buy,4,"I bought this car in 2005, needed a larger car for our new baby. It has been such a great buy! It is super reliable, nothing has ever broken down on it and it runs like a champ. It has almost 90,000 miles on it now and is still running as great as the day I bought it. It is awesome in the snow, when we had a huge storm here 2 years ago, I was passing up every other SUV and truck left and right as they all got stuck or slid down a the hill. I would recommend this car to anyone, it has been great for us!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,molly, 09/13/2010,Handles all weather,4,"I have driven my Outlander all over the country, in Massachusetts snowstorms, New Mexico's wind storms, Pennsylvania's pelting rain, and Arizona's searing heat, and it has never let me down. It handles really, really well in the snow. I have not had to do anything other than routine maintenance. The original battery lasted for 7 years, and the paint still looks great. It has a few idiosyncrasies: It makes a strange chirping sound in cool, humid climates (in San Francisco, in particular). As others have noted, it's not the peppiest. It drags on steep hills (like the big one in Camarillo, CA, on the 101 southbound), and I have to stick to the slow lane. All in all, I've been very pleased."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,lionesse2015, 01/02/2015,Best Money I ever Spent,4,This is the most awesome car I have driven to NY and Ga on many occasions. I bought the car used with 14k mikes on it today 12years later and 13 years old it's at 214k. Awesome on gas unassuming and just an all around dream. I am in the market for a new car right now and fear I will never find something as good as my outlander.
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,PMB, 05/02/2009,Best Car I Have Ever Owned,4,"I have owned more than two dozen new cars in my lifetime, and this one wins hands down for being the most reliable one. Nothing else even comes close!!!  I had it for almost six years and had to trade it in at 165K miles due to insurance premiums on multiple cars. It still ran like a dream, and I hated to see it go. Of course, I faithfully changed my oil with high quality products every 3000 miles. This one is really easy to do it yourself."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,M. Taylor, 12/29/2016,Incredible reliability,4,"Mitsu has a poor image here in the US but the Outlander was a great car for my family.  We purchased ours new in the summer of 2003. It was the XLS model with AWD and all factory options. It was originally my wife's car and she chose it over the CR-V and RAV4 due to our positive experience with a prior Mitsu SUV (Montero Sport) and the availability of a sunroof along with heated leather seats. A year later, we got her another car and I took over the Outlander. We traded the Outlander in for new car in Feb 2016. It had 302,000 miles on the original engine and transmission. The Mitsu was extremely reliable for us with the interior and exterior holding up well through the those 13 years. My only gripes: slow acceleration, average fuel consumption, and timing belt had to be changed every 60k miles.
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Ellie, 12/06/2009,Old reliable,4,"I bought this car because the year-end price was too good to refuse  (despite not being crazy about the ext styling), but am amazed at the reliability. Almost 80k miles on it and only oil changes/checks & recall replacements. Now needs a new battery.  Roomy interior, comfortable on a 2k mile trip.  Gas mileage better than expected (average 23-24MPG overall). "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,gail, 07/21/2006,Saved our Lives,3,"Our Outlander saved me, my daughter's and her friend's lives!  Tonight we were in a terrible car accident where I went into a ditch and my truck flipped over three times!  We all had our seatbelts on, the back windows shattered OUT the car, the sides got bangged up, but the doors never caved in, the roof and hood were badly smashed.  When people passed the vehicle, they were horrified...and could not believe we were alive!  I am going to buy another...as I feel it truly saved us....I give it a five star safety rating...thanks Mitsubishi!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Jane, 10/11/2009,Solid car - very pleased,4,"We purchased our car 1 year used with about 12000 miles on it.  We've been very happy with it.  Like any car that is now 6 or so years old, it has a few rattles and such, but not many.  It has not had any major issues (regular maintenance only), other than a known issue with the dash AC/Heat selector.  Now I must switch from AC to heat from under the dash or pay to fix it (around $1500, so I won't do it).  Mileage is right around 20mpg for mix of around town and highway.  It's very comfortable to drive and ride in - we regularly make 8+ hour treks in the car and find it very comfy.  The car has held up well over the years.  Very happy with it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,btotherich06, 09/22/2010,Great car thus far,4,"I bought this car just recently with just under 76,000 miles, and am very impressed so far.  Only major defect I had was the moonroof motor was falling apart, which happened five days after I bought it.  Thankfully my auto broker paid for the repair.  Even though I have only had this car for almost a month, I can picture myself driving this car until well over 200k miles!  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,tballer1976, 06/27/2008,Pleasantly surprised in Hawaii,5,"This car was not first choice but it has been dependable for 5+ years! When on the mainland, it's been to New Mexico, Las Vegas, & throughout California with no problems. Driven through rain, fog, & desert too. It's great to have for long drives & the MPG is comparable to other SUVs of its type/year. The interior is well spaced, especially for back seat passengers, & the stock sound system is surprisingly good. A/C is still running great too. Only complaint is the front seat headrests. I feel like my head is jutted out too forward. Had to just turn my headrest the other way. Also, maintenance at Mitsubishi dealers can get quite pricey, but it is the dealer after all. Great car!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,john, 12/30/2007,Disappointed,1,"I bought this vehicle brand new thinking I was getting a good deal since it was the last '03 in town. Well lets see, the catalytic converter has been replaced, as well as they entire air conditioning system-which you can only buy the parts from the dealership. Also the cv-joints have been replaced and I only get 16mpg- combined city and highway. You would think it had 100k plus miles, but I just traded it in with 67k. There was no power, touchy transmission, a super disappointment to drive. I also felt every bump in the road and it was so uncomfortable. Also my partner was 6'4"" and his knees hit the dashboard and he could hardly drive it. It was cramped and a huge disappointment."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Robert, 12/30/2005,Outlander,3,"After three years of fairly trouble free operation the radiator in my Mitsubishi Outlander blew causing the enigine to overheat and sustain further damage. The problem was with a defective fan controller known by Mitsubishi. They elected to cover the cost of all the parts, but not the labor. Is that good customer service? I don't think so.  BTW, all this happened just one month after the warranty expired."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,roger, 01/06/2009,Good value,4,"I purchased the 2003 Outlander AWD new and have only had oil changes, tires and a couple recalls since.  It's been a very reliable, versatile and economical vehicle."

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,cturner291, 12/07/2002,Owner Impression of the 2003 Outlander,4,"Just recently bought a 2003 XLS front 
wheel drive model and first impressions 
of it are favorable. It has a well 
thought out design, solid Japanese 
quality, and very quiet and extremely 
smooth ride on the highway.

Handles well in tight traffic and is 
fun to drive. It has a comfortable 
interior with lots of leg room that 
won't have you cramping up with back 
problems after 300 miles or so.

Peppy but not great acceleration out of 
the small 4-cyl. but is more than 
adequate for most normal driving and 
the gas mileage savings offset the lack 
of the V-6.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,myke, 05/08/2003,Great Car!,4,"Have had our Outlander about 6 weeks 
now.  Haven't found anything wrong

Comfortable, easy in, easy out.  Bought 
it primarily to be an economical 
cruiser around town, handles that 
flawlessly.  On the highway, I've had 
it up to 80, cruised at 70, felt safe & 
secure.  First foreign vehicle, 
extremely pleased with it so far."

called ""crossover"" models and the 
outlander is by far the best choice. It 
gets unbelievable gas mileage and sits 
up high enough to feel like your up 
with the big boys.My biggest concern 
when buying this vehicle was all the 
negative reviews concerning the power 
to get up and go.At 75 mph you are 
barely at 3000 rpm! I guess if you 
wanna drive a 100 mph power would be a 
problem but for everyday comuters this 
is the best.  To give you a better idea 
as far as the size of the suv it is 
probably the same height and size a the 
old chevy blazer 4 door. Overall this 
was a great buy."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Mister Digger, 03/19/2008,The Most Reliable Vehicle I Ever Owned,3,"This is my fifteenth car in 20 years, so for this one to give me almost no trouble for 160,000 miles is truly remarkable. The AC went out at about 100K miles, just after doing a major overhaul as preventative maintenance (the timing belt was still good). The latch on the driver's side rear seat also went out at about 80K miles, but that was very minor.  With gas prices soaring and me griping about only getting 24 MPG in this SUV, I did the unthinkable and tried to trade it in on a gas saving economy car. Well, I should thank the sales manager for giving me an insult of an offer for trade-in. I canceled the deal and kept this vehicle. If it works, don't fix it! "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,ahinde, 06/17/2008,It all fell apart!,3,"I really liked my 2003 outlander when I bought in in 2004, but soon after that I found it had many problems. Every summer water fills inside my air conditioner and causes it to short out causing a new blower motor to be replaced.  This wasn't all covered by warranty and they could never figure out why it would do this.  Also my entire suspension has been changed and only a year later it's already squeaking.  Also our temp dial doesn't rotate freely anymore, the cable designed badly and has been replaced once already.  There are also numerous issues with this model and Mitsubishi won't do recalls on.  Overall I would not purchase another one!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,T'cha-Mi'iko, 01/07/2009,I it lots and bunches,4,"My Outlander started as a rental unit but now has a home. I drive it in East Idaho in the deep snow drifts we get here and black ice conditions with no problems. On warmer days it zips along nicely on the freeway. On railroad crossings and bumpy back country roads it does rattle a bit, but the reviews mentioned that and it is not a problem. It tracked well when I stomped on the brakes to see how they did on an icy road-tracked straight ahead and continued ok when I let off the brakes. It does build up road slush in winter conditions in the wheel wells but it is easy to clean out when I stop. A great vehicle, looks good, rides nice. Looking forward to seeing how it does in the summer."

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,jf, 05/07/2006,Outlander AWD SUV,4,"The Mitsubishi Outlander is a great mid-size SUV with lots of room inside.  It is very comfortable and has a very nice radio system.  The bass sounds very good for an SUV. It drives very well in the snow with its AWD.  This is a very reliable vehicle when it comes to bad weather. Also, it drives very smoothly.  It is not not bumpy. It's easy to control even for younger adults.  Its not too big and not to small.  The Sports-tronic tranmission is great too.  It feels like you're driving a manual transmission when you get bored with the automatic."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,jmercado787, 04/20/2008,Great Ride,4,"I bought the outlander thinking I was going to buy another car later. Yea right, I'm keeping this bad boy.

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,ikay, 11/13/2002,XLS AWD with leather package,4,"I got it and I love it. The engine has 
not been a problem. 140hp is enough for 
most people. Someone likes to compare 
with 200-hp+ SUV. We never get to use 
the full power anyway or you get 
busted. However, when speeding up, the 
engine is kind of loud as other 
mitsubishi. It did not bother me. The 
sportronic is very nice and it actually 
works well. It has a very good driving 
position in the car. you don't slide so 
much even with leather when turning

Every time it would happen again until the my warranty ran out and they thought they could refuse to fix it! ha!! LEMON LAW!!  Now I replaced the brakes on the front and guess what? I could not get the driver side brake to bleed!!  Took it to a brake shop!!  The master cylinder is out and I only have two brakes!! the part cost $374.  My payment is $500/mo.

alignment. However when I called the 
dealership, service told me the 2003's 
had a known defect requiring a major

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Hfelen Uhrmaan, 11/27/2002,Large small SUV,5,"The Outlander feels more spacious than 
any of the other small SUVs I 
considered. Despite the small engine, 
it doesn't struggle to climb the 
mountain roads of West Virginia, and it 
hugs the curves very well.  The 
combination automatic/manual shifting 
worked well to get me up my icey drive 
and the AWD seemed surefooted on the 
snow this morning.  The hatch is easier 
to open and close one handed than other 
SUVs.  The cargo area with the rubber 
liner tray option is great for my 40 
pound dog.  The exterior design lacks 
the safari feel of my old Montero, but 
the smoother ride and better gas 
economy, along with the luxury features 
make it a pleasure to drive."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Sibs, 12/09/2002,New Purchase,4,"Narrowed choices to the Outlander or 
the Honda CRV.  Drove both.  Did not 
like the CRV at all.  Good pep, but why 
anyone would put the hand brake on the 
dash is beyond me.  Didn't like the 
dash layout at all.  The headrest on 
the backseat of the CRV almost 
completely blocked your view when 
backing.
Wife and I both have bad backs.  The 
seats in the Outlander are great.  We 
like the dash layout.  The Outlander 
had almost everything we wanted as 
standard equipment.  Salesman was 
great.  Look forward to enjoying the

was not impressed at all,i found hype 
more than substance.then i drove the 
mitsubishi outlander xls and found the 
real thing a very comfortable and 
stable ride,suburb handling for a suv 
a very solid build quality inside and 
out.everything that i have read 
complains about this suv being under 
powered but thats only if you don't 
know how to drive,i can with the 
sportronic 4 speed auto if used with 
some inteligents you can make it get 
up and move with the best of them so 
don't beleave all the experts because 
they have ties to the suv's that they 
hype.the outlander is the best bar 
none just go drive one and you will 
see."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Congaman, 12/16/2002,Outlander outdoes itself,4,"I went in to buy a Montero Sport, and 
walked out with the Outlander.  It 
rides like a car, and has plenty of 
room for my stuff.  And my kid&#8217;s stuff,
Hula dancing, boogie boarding etc.  I 
realized I could do most of the same 
driving in the Outlander than in the 
Montero for less money and better fuel 
efficiency."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Mariano , 12/24/2002,Best in it's class!,4,"Exactly what my wife expected and 
need.  Nice high quality interior, 
superb sound system, adequate cargo 
space, great fit & finish, nice extra 
gadgets.  Of course for my taste I 
would've prefered a 6 cylinders 
engine, but then again this is not a 
vehicle for sport cars fans like me.  
Great car for it's price."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Linus, 12/27/2002,My New Outlander,5,"I would have given this car a 
perfect ""10"" but for two things:

1.  I wish it came in a V6 option.
2.  I wish it had XM satellite radio as 
an option.

Otherwise, this car is perfect in every 
way (OK, maybe I'm exaggerating, but I 
really love this car)."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Douglas M., 12/29/2002,My 2003,4,"Nice vehicle, well built"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,robert , 01/01/2003,the ride,5,"i like the fact that you can shift 
gears on the fly its a cool deal that 
mistibishi has come up with great 
turning and handling great on gas i  
like the heated seats and the pick up 
on the highway is great what a fun ride"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,bkey79, 01/04/2003,EXCELLENT!!!!,4,"We bought the car Dec 26th and already 
have put close to 2000 mi on it!  Very 
fun to drive, and handles very well! 
The gas mileage is getting better with 
every fill up!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,el dog, 01/13/2003,Nice mini suv,4,"The outlander is a quiet mini-suv that 
demands a test drive. It's a real 
suburban vehicle for shopping, picking 
up the kids etc. I enjoy the clear view 
of the road from the driver position. 
The acceleration in the lower rpm's is 
great for city driving. If you need to 
carry large items this is not for you! 
I've notice that cargo space in limited 
but other than that I have no 
complaints!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,javagirl1, 01/14/2003,"Fantastic, XTERRA ++++!",4,"very similar to Nissan's XTERRA only 
with additional features and better gas 
milage.  Only drawback is it is a bit 
less stable due to narrower roadbase 
footprint.  Had EXTERRA, like this much 
more for a comparable price.  Bettrta 
than Honda CRV too!  4cyl is 
amazing...skeptic 'till I test drove it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Gary Raymond, 01/24/2003,5600 miles,4,"At almost 6000 miles the Outlander is 
still impresing me. Power to spair on 
hills and on the ice mountains sure 
footed like a cat. this is a great car 
at a great price."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,mdt, 01/22/2003,super fun!,4,"We haven't owned our Outlander for 
long, but we sure are enjoying it. 
It's peppy off the line, despite it's 
4cl. engine. But the extras we got, and 
the way cool looking body, make up for 
that. If you are looking at a CR-V 
(like I was), take the time to test out 
an Outlander."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Dina Marie, 01/23/2003,What a Find!,5,"This is my first SUV. I love the 
control i have of the seat. I'm not 
used to the elevated position for 
parellel parking, that's when i raise 
the seat up so i can see all corners. 
I'm a city girl, so parellel parking is 
my only way to park. What i thought 
would be difficult is really a cinch.

i love the privacy windows. i love the 
nice smooth ride and the confidence of 
the pick up the Outlander has to it's 
horsepower.   The aero-dynamics of the 
front end are marvelous compared to the 
other competitors. 
This is quite exciting having come from 
driving a Dodge Neon with faulty 
engineering."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,JMErbrick1980, 01/24/2003,Checqued out Outlander-Good Choice,4,"The other day I went to look at the 
Outlander, since I needed a larger 
vehicle. My first impressions were for 
the most part positive, but would have 
been more positive, had Mitsubishi 
added the Galant V6 as an option. A 
little underpowered, but overall a 
good choice."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,tomcat14, 01/27/2003,Test drive,3,"Rides like a car, nice interior, lots 
of places for storage.
Did not like how break pedal works. 
Very soft and has to be pressed all the 
way down. And now comes the bad news: 
VERY UNDERPOWERED. Driving a 6 cyl. 
Maxima now, I would expect different 
performance from the 4 cyl. car, but 
140 HP (even with highly advertised 
torque) just enough for this car. The 
engine made a noise and struggled when 
I tried to merge into highway from an 
exit. At 55mph it was hard to find 
extra power boost for passing other 
cars."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,d-rab, 01/30/2003,Great Vehicle,5,"I love our new Outlander.  Everything 
about it is great including the price.  
My only request is that it had a V6.  
It has plenty of power with the 4 
cylinder but I am a big horsepower kind 
of guy.  It is still great without it, 
but it would be just that much better 
with it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Outlanded, 02/03/2003,Just got one,5,"I took the plunge on the Outlander.    
Similar cars (outback, rav4 etc) in 
it's class don't even come close on the 
amenities/ style.   This car has 
exceeded my expectations in every 
way.  I tested it out in the snow, 
freezing rain and I couldn't 
be happier with it.  Oh and BTW if 
you're concerned about the small 
(140hp) engine, don't worry.   I was 
initially concerned about this too from 
all the posts I read,  but these are 
from folks who are expecting a 200hp 
monster truck or a sports car.  IMHO, 
this car can handle its own...  But 
anyway,  it is so much fun to drive, 
why rush?!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,jnpchad, 02/05/2003,Great deal for its cost!!!,5,"I've had the car for a short time but 
it is truly fun to drive.  Its a 
smooth ride and very comfortable to 
sit in and drive.  For the cost of 
this car you really get more than what 
you pay for.  Prior to this car I had 
a Ford Expedition which I LOVED....I 
am just as happy with this car with 
the exception of the 4 cyl. engine...I 
am use to a V8 so this is quite a 
difference.  But overall, I am very 
happy about the quality and comfort of 
this vehicle for its cost."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,randyptl, 02/15/2003,Good in the snow,4,"Overall it is great.  Not much on 
acceleration, however, it rides well 
on the highway.   My kids love the arm 
rest with the drink holders and the 
back seat fits two car seats well."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Rustaman, 02/20/2003,Some fun eh?,4,"First the nits. No Power! Needs a turbo 
bad! You'll need a calendar to clock 0 
to 60 times. The Infinity stereo is 
horrible. FM reception reaches only 
about 40 miles. The speakers are just 
bad. The DC outlet is only powered when 
the car is on - my cell phone is always 
dead. Brake and gas pedals kind of 
close sometimes I hit both with my size 
9 feet. The Sportronic trans is just a 
gimmick. Gas mileage is a disappointing 
17mpg in mixed driving. BUT (really big 
but) this puppy is fun to drive. It 
handles like a sports car and loves 
curves. Goes fine in ice and snow too. 
Even with all the minor annoyances I 
love driving this car. Now, if it only 
had a turbo!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,JoJoFlyboy, 02/23/2003,Just got this SUV,4,"Nice 
car/SUV, meaning it drives more like a 
car than the others, Santa Fe, CRV 
ect.  Paid just a bit more than the TMV 
value on Edmunds for a XLS with ""sun 
and sound"" package.  Only negative is 
that you cannot seem to find one, 
especially in the south with ABS 
without getting the luxury package 
also.  Mitsu is one of the only 
companies around that ABS isn't 
standard or available as a single 
option.  Interior is very nice, except 
for the gaping hole below the radio for 
cell phones ect. Ample leg room and 
headroom, I am 6'3,my head scraped the 
top on the Santa Fe. Exterior, still
not totally convinced on. SUV is for 
wife and she likes it a great deal."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Bordell, 02/26/2003,"Great car, but....",4,"I bought an Outlander in November 
2002.  I love the styling, performance, 
comfort, and braking of the car. 
Acceleration is good too, not sure 
where Edmonds and Car and Driver got 
theirs from but mine is peppy.  I have 
had a problem with the car drifting to 
the right ever since I got it.  It has 
been back to the dealer 4 times to get 
corrected but they have not been able 
to get it right.  They tell me that 
there may be a recall on Outlanders to 
correct this problem when Mitsubishi 
gets the fix in a few weeks.  Have any 
other owners had this problem?  Let me 
know.  I have had no other problems, I 
really do like the car."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,dfrenchbk, 07/03/2003,Sleeper In a Busy Market!!,5,"After alot of research, I had settled 
on the Honda CRV - but decided to 
drive the Outlander anyway because of 
the great finance deals.  I never went 
back to Honda - the Outlander looks 
great (especially in silver) and drove 
very well.  The seats are excellent, 
the interior was very well though out 
and overall the car was just what I 
wanted for long (500 mile commutes 
with kids) and driving around town.  
Also a great vehicle for cyclists - 
getting a roof rack on the top soon!  
Overall, a great value compared to the 
higher priced competitors - check it 
out.

  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,bob bove, 07/13/2003,like it but,4,"the interior could be a little more 
cushiony seat is a little hard but 
overall a pleasure to drive"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,DACNA, 07/16/2003,Very good--not excellent.,4,"The interior is flawless. Honda could 
learn something or two from this 
vehicle. The seats are supportive and 
very comfortable. The rear seat and 
space is remarkable considering its a 
mini-ute. Yes, cargo and power are 
down, and fuel consumption is not the 
best. But the torquey punch is great. 
This engine races to the redline so 
first gear upshifts need to be guarded 
while going through the gears. The 
Freelander is the only other mini-ute 
to offer a manumatic shifter, albeit a 
5 speed.The stereo is clear, accurate, 
and thumps. The styling is great til 
you get to the rear (too quasi-
econowagon) You should pay about $200 
over invoice; I did.  "

comfy and roomy inside.  It is the 
best car in my garage!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,MellyG, 08/15/2003,Made a big switch,4,"My husband and I traded in our beloved 
Acura Integra for the Outlander in 
preparation for a family. I admit I 
miss the sports car, but other than the 
loss of power, I absolutely love this 
car/suv (my husband calls it 
a ""cruck""). We have the upgraded sound 
and sun package and the stereo sounds 
awesome! The sunroof doesn't open as 
wide as I'd like, but it's still nice. 
I love the interior design. Not many 
people have this car which is nice. We 
are the only ones in town to have the 
Green Pearl Color which I also love. 
The only regret is not getting the AWD. 
The 2.4 also make a funny whistle sound 
which I was told is normal...we wish it 
didn't do that."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,marcus mauceri, 08/20/2003,best value suv for 2003!,4,"i did my research and it paid off well 
i reccomend the leather and get sport

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,bobchiu, 08/20/2003,Fun to drive,4,"I saw a couple of these media 
Outlanders driving up from Kuwait to 
Baghdad, Iraq with big ""TV"" in masking 
tape.  I really wished riding the 
Outlanders instead of my G.I. Humvee.  
After coming back home from 
deployment, I took a 550 mile drive 
from Temecula to Sunnyvale CA and 
surprisingly was not fatigued.  With 3 
people, the ride is very comfortable 
and quiet, power is adequate enough to 
pass other vehicles up the I-
5 ""Grapevine"". Mitsubishi did great 
interior design on this, it does not 
give you the cheap feel.       "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,nancydollhouse, 08/20/2003,funtoown,4,"Great fun to drive.  Handles like a car

buy yours now!¡hurry!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,mccoygreer@aol.com, 02/28/2003,Love It,4,"I purchase my Outlander last month and 
I really like it. The only thing is I 
hear sort of a rattle type sound when I 
accelerate.  It truly sounds like a 
rattle underneath near the catylitic 
converter or something.  I've taken it 
back and they tell me that's normal in 
the 4cyl.  Has anyone else experience 
the same sound?"

Leased Galant. Price was right, had to 
wait to get the Pearl White with Sun

The only problem I have with the 
vehicle is that the steering wheel 
placement blocks top of speedometer, 
Sunroof did not open as wide as I 
expected, and power is lacking a little."

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,gold star, 09/08/2003,A Smart SUV,4,"The Outlander LSAWD surpassed our 
expectation.It's like you're riding in 
Lexus based on comfort and its rear end 
design.The height is lower Compared to 
Rav4 & Honda CRV so you are more closer 
to the ground in proportion to its 
center of gravity so you are more 
stable,its like riding in Subaru 
Forester.In regards with fuel its good 
it doesn't cost as much as other suv.If 
your looking in SUV which you can use 
in all terrain try the Outlander,I can 
say you won't regret it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,renae, 09/12/2003,exceptional small suv,4,"Driving this suv was like driving a 
sedan. It not only handled well, but I 
had an excellent view from every angle. 
Some may say it doesn't have a lot 
of ""pep in its step"", but it wasn't a 
problem for me on the freeway. I would 
like in the future for mitsubishi to 
offer in its pck. an alarm system and 
auto on daytime running lights. I love 
my outlander and so does my husband, 
and yes I would purchase it again."

handles like a car but feels and has 
the capacity of an suv.  The ride is 
extremely quite and smooth.  I picked 
this over the new honda element because 
of the ride.  It has great styling and 
the price is right!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Spakie, 07/22/2003,Wasn't even looking...,4,"I have had my Outlander for a little 
over three months, and really like it. 
When I first started looking for a 
small SUV, due to lower back problems 
aggrivated by my current car, I was 
primarily focused on the Honda CR-V and 
lookig at Pre-Owned. The price tag of 
the 3-year old CR-V with 38K and the 
brand new Outlander LS AWD were almost 
identical. I found the Seating in the 
Outlander far more comfortable. No 
brainer... bought the Outlander. Like 
everything thus far but, like many 
others, would like to have about 20-30 
more HP on occasion. The Sportshift 
mode does help."

of the SUVs in this pricerange.  CRV,

Not one of them could offer all of the 
extras for the same money that I got 
with my Outlander.  I got leather, 
moon roof, everything for less money 
than a stripped down Escape or 
Highlander.  The ride is incredible 
and very quiet. With the sport-tronic

couldn't get the right deal.  On the 
way to a 2nd Toyota dealer, we decided 
to stop and check out the Mitsubishi.  
She loved the style, it drove great,

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Pirate-King, 11/03/2003,"so far, so good",4,"like many others, I was NOT looking at 
the OUTLANDER...I was deciding between 
the PATHFINDER ( which is too expensive)
and the FORRESTER ( which is 
too ""soccer-mommy"" for me )
But after driving the OULANDER, I was 
impressed, and bought it on the spot. 
Saved THOUSANDS over the aforementioned 
autos as well. EXCELLENT handling, and 
smooth, effortless shifting in sport 
mode. The stereo has a little less 
wattage and thump than I like, but that 
is being kinda petty. Overall, I would 
recommend this SUV to anyone ( UNLESS 
you intent to off-road..this is NOT the 
SUV for that!! )"

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,John Logan, 05/12/2005,Mitsubishi Outlander - Love It!,4,"Bought it in 3/03. Drove it for 40,000 miles and gave it to my son. I took it the other day to change the oil, I miss it!  Great little truck! Fun to drive, gives you the feel of a bigger SUV (I have a 4x4 explorer too) gas mileage is good. Comfortable interior and stylish exterior at a great price, very reliable. The 4th Mitsubishi I've owned, I recommend them highly."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,cristine, 11/15/2003,outlander,4,"I love my Outlander, it handles really 
well, it;s very comfortable and great 
to run around and do errands in. The 
height is just right for getting in and 
out. I find all the controls easy to 
use, and the sound system is great. My 
only complaint is the gas mileage. It's 
not that great but maybe that's becasue 
everyone in my house wants to use it 
all the time. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,AVANANNA, 12/02/2003,More for a lot less!!,5,"This is a wonderful SUV and less 
expensive than traditional SUV's. I was 
very surprised at how great the gas 
mileage was and very happy about the 
roominess of the back seat. Both car 
seats fit perfectly with a fold down 
arm rest suitable and within reach of 
the sippy cup and bottle. Although the 
cargo area isn't very large, it will 
accomodate a bulky jogging stroller. I 
think the Outlander overall is a great 
roadtrip car, peppy, roomy, great gas 
mileage, SAFE and stylish.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,OutLanderer, 12/09/2003,Good Performance with Premium Fuel,4,"One thing I discovered in last few 
months is, substantial improvement in 
acceleration with Uleaded Plus or 
premium fuel(even better). I never 
used to believe in it. But the 
difference is day and night. The added 
bonus is 1 more extra mile gallon
(compensates for extra money spent)."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Larry Rushton, 12/24/2003,Like Mitsubishi But,4,"Mitsubishi builds solid vehicles. No 
exception here.  Design, comfort,

Sound system best I've ever had. 
Handles and rides in a very smooth 
manner."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,tweetybird, 12/30/2003,Great Vehicle,4,"After owning a Honda, Nissan & Toyota 
(all were great vehicles) I was a 
little nervous about Mitsubishi. I 
didn't know anyone with an Outlander. I 
test drove a Honda CRV and was very 
disappointed.  It was cheap looking. 
The Toyota Highlander was expensive 
with accessories.  I was totally 
surprised by the Outlander!  Super SUV. 
Fun to drive!  It's drives like a 
foreign sports car.  Handles well. Lots 
of PEP!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,litakhing, 03/04/2003,Good bargain!,5,"The Outlander has surprising amount of 
control and stability for such a 
budget-priced entry.  I love the 
manual ""Sportronic"" shift mode.  It 
makes the Outlander more fun to 
drive.  Nothing inside appears 
cluttered, but everything seems just 
right. The instrument panel is simple 
with a center-mounted analog clock 
above the comfort and sound system 
controls.  Overall, the new Outlander 
seems a standout in a field that 
includes the established likes of Ford 
Escape, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,MostlyCinical, 01/12/2004,All I Need,4,"After driving for a year, it has lived 
up to my high expectations.  I read the 
reviews of ""not enough power,"" but 
waited until I drove it to form my own 
opinion.  The clutchless manual gives 
the passing and highway entrance you 
want.  I the automatic mode is tuned 
nicely to the engine's power.  The ride 
is beautiful.  Take it on some windy 
country roads and go hard into the 
turns and it'll make you smile.  Tell 
your back seat passengers to recline 
and they'll smile.  I found the 
Infinity stereo to be OK, I had to turn 
the bass down or it would distort.  No 
mechanical or body probs.  Great 
entrance and exit height.  Range is 300 
miles between fill-ups."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Adam Barcant, 01/16/2004,A Reliable alternative,4,"This SUV has quality. You can feel it 
in the way it drives and feels. I 
would reccomend it to anyone who is 
looking for a good-looking small SUV 
similar to the Honda CRV but much 
better than the RAV-4. You must shop 
around first. Here are some choices to 
look at:
Jeep Liberty
Suzuki Grand Vitara
Mitsubishi Outlander
Honda CRV
Ford Escape
Toyota RAV4
Mazda Tribute

Mitsubishis are really good cars. So 
are Hondas. I would stick with either 
of them, but styling is a little 
different."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,tampabayzeta, 01/20/2004,A Great Decision,4,"My Rio Red Outlander is the cutest 
little thing.  It does feel more like 
a car than an SUV, but that's alright 
with me.  Had a Ford Escape before, 
and always felt like I was going to 
tip over in curves.  Very comfortable 
to drive.  Design is awesome!!  A 
great decision overall for the money!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,dougboy, 01/23/2004,my new outlander,4,"I just bought it but am impressed with 
comfort and quality overall.  Does lack

money i think it is very good in its 
class."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,bigdaddyhow, 02/09/2004,Outlander - Great Ride/Drive,4,"This is a very driver friendly 
vehicle, especially in the city.  
Quick acceleration 0-30, but 4 cyl not 
ideal for two lane passing.  One of 
the better body styles out there in 
it's class.  About 25-26 MPG highway 
which is pretty good considering."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,bekalynn, 03/05/2003,Love it!,5,"This is actually alot of car for the 
price!  My husband and I decided to 
just get the LS trim with the 
convenience and appearance packages, 
which gave that extra edge for 
sportiness.  The ride is extremely 
smooth and it's not so high up that I 
(as a shorter individual) have to climb 
into it.  The mini SUV has alot more 
cargo room that first appearance and 
there is alot of storage all throughout."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,Lily, 02/01/2006,First Car and an SUV,4,"I love the way the Mitsubishi Outlander handles on unpaved roads in good and bad weather, even in more than a foot of snow.  It is roomy from front to back but could use a little more headroom, even when the seat is totally down.  Also, its gas mileage could be better.  It does zero to sixty in about 10 seconds which is sluggish in some situations but livable. It has a smooth ride at any speed.  It is the first vehicle I purchased on my own and I wanted an SUV. I bought it used from a car rental company where it was well maintained. My maintence costs have been low.  It is large enough for what I need and small enough that it is easy to park without taking up extra space.  Sometimes it gets hidden behind other bigger SUV's in mall parking lots!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,avenger, 02/19/2004,Giddyup!,5,"  My wife & I were just looking at 
crossover vehicles. We stumbled upon 
the outlander & my wife fell in love 
with it! I wasn't sold until we drove 
it. It's actually enjoyable to drive!! 
We aren't looking for a sports car so 
the 2.4 gives just enough power. But we 
also don't deal with city traffic & 
highway merging issues. Overall we'll 
be driving it for a few more years. 
Hopefully we'll enjoy it as long!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,RCC, 02/27/2004,Great small SUV,4,"I'm 6'0"" tall and have plenty of 
room.  While I don't ride in the back, 
friend who are my height do with 
little issue.  The one thing I liked 
about the Outlander was the exterior 
styling.  While it is still and SUV, 
it looks more sporty than most.  It 
definitely stands out.  I also can't 
complain about he AWD.  I live near 
Pittsburgh, PA and didn't have any 
problems in the snow this winter.  The 
only thing I wanted that mine did not 
have of the lot was a sunroof, but I 
added a one-touch power sunroof and 
love it.  I wouldn't hesitate to get 
another."

the head light spreding light all over

market fog light and after market light

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,03ol, 03/18/2004,Safety First,4,"I have owned a few suv's and the 
mitsubishi outlander is by far the best 
i have owned.  It has great styling, 
perfect ride, plenty of room and the 
back seats recline, how cool is that. 
the only problem i have is the gas 
millage could be a little better. But 
the best thing about it is, i was hit 
in the front passenger side at about 30 
mph and i had about $4500 in damages. i 
know it sounds like alot but the other 
car, a 2003 nissan maxima was 
completely totaled (the engine even 
fell out).  i highly recomend the 
Outlander....."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,barbie3, 03/24/2004,mighty mite,5,"I say that my Outlander XLS is a baby 
SUV that hasn't grown up yet. It has 
all the power of a large SUV but it's 
not all big and bulky. It's super fun 
to drive especially since I can change 
between automatic and manual driving 
without the hassle of a clutch. It has 
a ton of interior room and that was a 
must as we are a family of 4 with a lot 
of hobbies. I was looking at the Toyota 
Matrix but I'm so much more pleased 
with my Outlander."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,mitsuman, 03/24/2004,XLS AWD w/ all options is a Great Car!,4,"I've had my Outlander since May, and I have 
enjoyed it ever since.  No problems, very 
reliable.  This is a well built, reliable car that is 
great for a small family. I have 2 boys and it 
works very well with the car seats.  It isn't a 
rocket, but it is more than suitable for what 
it's intended. We live in hilly, northeast PA and 
can't complain.  Interior is very quiet and it's 
great on trips."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,ryanclements, 03/30/2004,can't beat it for the money,5,"My wife and I have had the Outlander 
for a year now and we still love it.  
It has a very car-ish ride and still 
has many of the useful things we were 
hoping to get from an SUV (cargo space, 
roomy ride).  ABS should be standard.  
It's probably not the best SUV on the 
market, but the cost makes it, in my 
opinion, the best value--which is most 
important.  It's pretty good on gas 
anyway, but we added a tornado fuel 
saver and the hwy mpg jumped by 4-6 
miles/gal!  The sportronic trannie is 
a hoot too.  I don't use it often, but 
there's plenty of juice when I need 
it.  We love it, and anyone that would 
give it a chance most likely will too."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,M Furst, 04/04/2004,"Rough location, good performance",4,"While out of the mainstream, my 
Outlander is subject to unusual abuse -
- I live in China and run this vehicle 
over roads in serious disrepair.  I 
find the ride over rough serfaces to 
be pretty good (maybe a reflection of 
Mitsubishis's long off-road exp.). The 
engine is pretty good in this 
iteration of the Outlander.  Plenty of 
power (presumaly the 160 horse 
version), yet fuel efficient enuf for 
the high gas prices here.  I look 
forward to running it in the snow but 
will have to wait 'til next year for 
that."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,jhmh, 04/03/2004,"Great Value, Comfort and Reliability",3,"I find the Outlander to be comfortable 
and stylish. The 2.4 liter engine 
provides the power level I expected 
(what do you expect from a 4 
cylinder?). I think it is enough power 
for most drivers. 
After reading through almost all of 
the other reviews, I have found some 
common complaints. 1)The vehicle pulls 
to one side. I don't think this is an 
alignment problem. 
2)Under hard acceleration, the muffler 
or something in the exhaust sounds 
like it is loose or has a hole in it. 
I checked the NHTSA website for 
recalls on these two specific items, 
but there are not any. 
Overall, I think this is a strong buy 
for the money. "

Went immediately down to drive the 
Outlander while the experience was 
still fresh in my mind and the Honda 
was totally blown away!  The Outlander 
is more solid feeling, seems much 
roomier, is MUCH quieter on the road

I find the accelaration a bit slow when entering the highway, but at high speeds, no problem. In city driving, there is no lack of accelaration. Not sure what the folks who say this vehicle lacks acceleration are looking for, racing type acceleration? If so go to high end V8s, this is a great buy and fun to drive too. "

The clock on the dashboard has an art-deco appeal and everybody likes it.

I really, really love this car!  It is great in snow, rain, shine, fog, city, on freeways or on backroads.  I understand some are not happy with the horsepower, but what do you expect? This car is a 4-cyl. and costs under $20,000 used.  Nothing has broken and it has not broken down, unlike my friend who has to take her VW Golf in once a month because every little thing breaks on her car. I would absolutely buy this again, although I don't have much need for AWD...it is nice to have but I think it is bad for the gas mileage.

she really cared anything about was a 
PT Cruiser GT that our local 
dealership gave us a really good price 
on (absolutely loaded for $21,500).
The Outlander keeps up with most V8s 
on the road.  Unfortunately, it gets 
around the same gas mileage as the big 
motor SUVs.
The size is just right.  It looked 
kinda big on the Mitsu lot, but it's

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,rmoose, 04/22/2003,Love at 1st sight,4,"Saw the commercial & ran out to get it!
Loved it even more in person. For a
smaller suv, it has a look that
definitely separates it from everything
else out there. Engine power is more
than adequate--I'm not on the autobahn
and I'd trade a gas-guzzling v6 for this
anyday. Interior is extremely roomy,
especially the back seat. Friends have
4-runner & we have more passenger room
than they do. More comfort too. I've
also been dealing with the whole
drifting-to-the-right-fiasco. Mitsu
really needs to do something about this.
Overall, it fits exactly what I was
looking for and I get many comliments on
it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,LadyFaire, 09/10/2007,Terrific Little SUV,4,"If you are looking for a smaller, more fuel efficient SUV, you could not find a better one than the Outlander, whatever the year.  I have the 2003, in 2 wheel drive, and both my husband and I liked it so much that he bought a new Outlander (AWD) last year when his Subaru (his 7th) quit.  I never thought he would abandon his Subarus, but he actually defected to my Outlander's side.  The Outlander handles like a dream, has a really nice sound system (once you fiddle with the balance, etc), the intelligent wipers are great, the seats are comfortable, and the gas mileage is respectable once you break in the engine (after about 30,000 miles).  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,el cow, 04/26/2003,Great SUV for the price,4,"The Outlander is a great value. It has 
so many more standard features than 
other SUVs and it is cheaper than them 
too. I would recommend this SUV to 
anyone using it for daily driving. 
Unfortunately it does not come with a 
V6, so it is a little slow and would 
not be good for towing large objects. 
The exterior and interior of the 
Outlander are very well designed and it 
is pretty sporty for an SUV."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,ALANNA, 05/04/2003,surpasses expetations,5,"I had read a number of reviews re the 
Outlander re its supposed lack of power 
which made me some what skeptical. I 
have taken the Outlander up and along 
the Mountain Highways of Utah and have 
not experienced a lack of power. This 
small SUV is fun to drive and Well 
built.  I 
purchased The Outlander LS on Saturday, 
May 3, 2003 and with 0% finacing for 60 
months plus a 7/70 powertrain warranty 
I think that I made great Choice. As 
with all Vehicles not everything is 
perfect. I Highly reccommend the 
Outlander."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,jerry37, 05/06/2003,Great car,4,"My wife and I were quite impressed with the 
styling/ design of this car (inside & out). The 
engine performs well on both city and 
highway driving and it's got  enough zip for 
merging/ passing.  The ride is comfortable 
and the cabin is very quiet for such a small 
car.  Having downsized from a 00 Mazda 
MPV (which we loved) I must say cargo 
space is more than adequate for our 
needs.  My only comment about the stereo 
has to do w/ the faceplate.  I wish it  was 
more customized (with more options) 
for this car and it did not look so generic.  
Otherwise, so far so good."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,lczick17, 05/16/2003,Very Happy,4,"Had it 5 months now.  Very Happy!  My 
wife and I both have bad backs.  These 
are the most comfortable seats we have 
ever had.  Took about 2K miles for the 
engine to break in and give 20MPG 
around town.  The dash layout is great, 
it puts everything at your finger tips.
I've had many people comment on the 
looks."

the comercial, but once I saw it in 
person and drove it, my wife and I 
loved it.  Only have about 1300 miles 
on it and the only complaints so far is 
it pulls to the right and the rattling 
sound while accelerating.  It is a 
distinct seperate sound from the 
engine, exactly in time with the 
accelerator. Bringing back to the 
dealer for evaluation on 4/25. "

the way a can drive like ill drive a 
car, i can take turns real fast and do 
be worried at all, To conclude its a 
real good buy for the money, 

performance side, i already installed a 
K&N Cone intake and it feels a lot more

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,blutenchi, 06/24/2003,number one out of my last five cars,4,"I purcahased my Outlander in January of 
2003, and I love it. It's my fifth 
vehicle and my favorite.  Compared to 
it's competitors it lacks a little in 
performance power, but it's handling is 
great and it is one of the most 
distinctive vehicles out.  Since it is 
still a fairly new vehicle on the 
market many people don't know what it 
is but always comment on it's style and 
features."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,JMH, 06/27/2003,One of the best purchases to make,5,"I traded in my 1.8T for this (yes I 
am 'growing up' or whatever I guess), 
so to me it had no power what-so-ever, 
but I'm not the most unbiased based on 
my former vehicle.

Once I got used to the idea that I was 
no longer going to see the 
acceleration, I got quite used to the 
adequate engine.   Also, by switching 
to 'clutchless shifting' for freeway 
ramps you can keep the car in a better 
gear.

Cup holders are placed in a position 
where I have to take my eyes off the 
road in order to locate my can of 
Coke.  Maybe I just haven't owned it 
long enough though.
Small, small issues with an otherwise 
great vehicle."
mitsubishi,outlander,2003,NeenaGrayDick, 12/10/2018,Pick up,4,"I read how it needs some pick up. I first started driving this vehicle it was like a little old lady. But, after I drove it a couple weeks it adapted to my way of driving. Which it has no option but to preform. I can drive a 3 cycle and burn hwy up. This vehicle has now 180+ miles on it. It's been in an accident need baring, front brakes and tires. Prior to the tires after barrings and brakes it had been raining and car Began to slide, I slipped about half foot and felt the wheels grip and move forward. It was definitely noticeable and once I got tires the drives are effortless. I put permimum gas with gas treatment in it and it began to have issues. Allowed gas to get low and refilled back to normal. It climbs up hills with ease. Body has held up well as has the paint. I just bought this vehicle in October of '18 it's 15 years old and running like a champ.

mitsubishi,outlander,2003,litterditty, 05/26/2019,"Overall, one of the best cars I've owned",4,"This car is a rock star in the winter. I've driven it for 6 years in VT, and I haven't lost control once (knock on wood). There is quite a bit of cargo room, the interior is very durable, and I'm happy with both the highway and city drivability. 

At 170k miles, on-going repairs are needed, but I feel like I got my money's worth. 

The biggest downsides: an issue with the headlight covers fogging up and a pretty flimsy plastic bumper.

It has only done 106,000 kilometers, looks immaculate inside and out, is very comfortable, handles well and is perfect in every respect bar one -- suspension (or shocks). No one can find anything wrong, yet while very smooth on good roads, smallish bumps and accompanying road noise suggest very rigid suspension. Is this a characteristic?"

I don't usually buy new cars and I was a devout VW person.
I bought the Outlander because I was starting a new business, needed a car and I didn't want to be distracted by used car pailings.
so I bought the cheapest new car I could find.
I spent all of $15,000.
I have NEVER had anything go wrong with this car.
I have only spent money on brakes, oil changes and tires.
The cost of ownership has been spectacular.
I will never buy a German car again, too pricey to repair and even for regular maintenance."

Great traction, never needed chains. Also comfortable and roomy.

mitsubishi,outlander,2004,SF Paul, 01/01/2004,"Good Value, Nice Ride",4,"This Outlander made an immediate 
impression on me and my wife.  The 
first thing that stood out was the fit 
and finish of the interior.  Nothing 
about this car feels or looks cheap. 
Looking at the front end it has a more 
aggressive appearance, but the rear 
end doesn't seem to match.  The 
performance is good for a four-
banger.  It's nimble on the curves, 
and 160 horses come in handy when 
passing or getting on the freeway.  On 
smooth surfaces the road noise is 
nominal and you'd swear you were 
driving a six.  Engine noise is nicely 
buffered too. I'm averaging around 22 
mpg with plenty of city driving.  The 
mpg drops if you use the Sportronic 
shifter."

Nothing but regular maintenance has been required and it is an easy and even fun car to drive.  Some reviews talk about a lack of power, but I have found the acceleration to be sprightly and the only time wishing it had more umph! is when loaded to the gills and trying to pass on a hill.  This is the first Mitsubishi I have owned, but if it is a representative sample I am very impressed and wouldn't hesitate to get another when I need to replace this one."

I only planned to keep it three or four years but it is still running well and not giving me any headaches. It has not been in the shop for much of anything besides normal maintenance. It handles very well in the snow - I will not go back to FWD. The gas mileage has stayed around 22 mpg.

were passing me up!! But other than 
that, it handled the roads very well
especially in rain storms. Never got 
uncomfortable riding/driving in it 
either for over 4,000 miles!!!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2004,brbrsks, 01/03/2004,So Far So Good,4,"I have owned the 2004 Outlander for 
about a month now. I absolutely love 
the appearance of it from all angles 
including the ""pointy"" front which 
somehow doesn't look as nice in 
photographs. The bucket seats are 
comfortable and roomy. The radio 
controls are just fine. The many 
storage spaces throughout the vehicle 
are well placed and designed, inluding 
the cup holders with room for coffee 
cup handles. I have not yet had the 
chance to calculate my gas mileage but 
I estimate it to be in the low twentys. 
The all wheel drive with sixteen inch 
rims really seems to hold the road even 
in the rain. It's a great little SUV!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2004,Diane/dihp10, 01/23/2004,Wonderful Car,5,"I wanted a mid size car that could get 
thru the snow in New Jersey.  This car 
is it!  I have always purchased 
Chevy's, not anymore,  this car is 
great. It handles perfectly in the bad 
weather and I like the option of manual 
shifting.  I am not an expert in the 
snow, but this car give me alittle more 
confidence driving in bad weather.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2004,Mealster, 01/24/2004,Great SUV,5,"I just bought my Outlander a few months 
ago and I love it. The ride is smooth. 
The front & back seat have plenty of 
room. The only downside is that there 
is not much cargo room. A little more 
would have been nice. But overall, no 
complaints about this vehicle. I just 
wish folks would stop calling it 
a ""glorified station wagon"". =)"

mitsubishi,outlander,2004,skarst1, 02/07/2004,"2004 Outlander XLS, replaces our Spyder",5,"This is our third Mitsubishi and we 
have been very happy with all three.  
This has to be the best so far.  It 
replaces a 2001 Spyder GT which was not 
being used.  The Outlander has the 
power we need with the convienience of 
all wheel drive which comes in very 
handy during Pennsylvania winters.  My 
wife is no longer afraid to drive in 
the snow, she now enjoys it.  We don't 
even miss the Spyder, this is as much 
fun to drive.  Would highly recommend 
this SUV.  We chose this over Honda's 
CRV and Element"
mitsubishi,outlander,2004,dcpizz, 02/08/2004,Best value vehicle I could find,5,"After driving a Chevy Avalanche for 
two years, I needed a vehicle with 
better gas mileage.  After test 
driving about 10 small SUV's, I 
decided on the Outlander. In three 
weeks and over 1500 miles, the vehicle 
has been fantastic.  Fun, easy & 
comfortable to drive, plenty of power 
(I don't do 100MPH), great in the snow 
& ice, and it looks good too.  For 
under 20K, it has all the features 
that I need.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2004,OutlndrLvr, 02/09/2004,I love mine,5,"My Outlander is my baby.  I have never 
been happier with a car/suv and I've 
had a few now.  It's classy looking, 
comfy and stylish on the inside, gets 
excellent gas mileage and is a decent 
size for a compact suv.  
I have the XLS and love it.  I thought 
about the sun & sound package 
(sunroof/Infinity sound system) so 
that I could get the Infinity sound 
system but opted against it after 
hearing the comparable factory 
system.  I won't say it's Infinity, 
but it is a good system nonetheless.  
The price was more than reasonable.
You also get a nice ride out of it and 
I find mine pretty quiet-never have to 
raise my voice to talk to other 
passengers. "

Nissan XTerra & Murano, and Hyundai

mitsubishi,outlander,2004,SteveS, 02/04/2004,Mitsubishi Outlander,4,"So far, we really like the car.  
Negatives are fairly poor gas mileage

to heat up the passenger cabin.  The 
cabin itself is roomy and fun to be 
in.  The car handles very well, and the 
engine is responsive when needed."

some equipment on the inside.  I took a 
chance on the Outlander because it 
seemed like it had a lot of value.

It's been 3 months now and this car is 
more than I ever thought it would be.

for long but we just got back from 
driving it on vacation and we both love 
it. Plenty of power, low road noise, no 
water leaks, standard sportronic 
automatic transmission is easy to use 
and works great. My wife loves the 
style and has been asked about it by a 
lot of people when she fills it up. I 
can't keep her out of it now. This is 
the third Mitsubishi we have owned and 
they all have been great, a vastly 
under-rated brand. We checked the 
Toyota RAV 4 and the Honda CR-V also 
but the Mitsu beat them in the areas 
where it counts. If you want to stand 
out in a crowd try put this machine on 
your shopping list."

wheel aligment. Since the first day 
(tried to make make myself think, that 
the road is always drifts to the 
right). However the dealership was able 
to fix this, but since it's so common 
issue with Outlanders, Mitsubishi has 
something to think about.
Other than this there is only excitment 
and pleasure.
Strong AC (live in Florida), 
comfortable driver seat, lots of room

stable cornering and holds the road 
well. "

something that makes people want to 
look,with features such as a rear

coated rear lights and sunroof- the 
frame is not boxy at all. This car will 
make you feel like your driving a 
sportscar with all the amentities plus 
its all wheel drive and slapstick 
gearshift.Finally,an SUV for people in 
their 30's. It has a 4 cylinder engine-
HOWEVER, you can go up a hill with your 
a/c on full blast and you lose no 
power! It has a spacious and 
comfortable interior with ample hauling 
space when rear seats are down. If you

mitsubishi,outlander,2004,brbrskss, 08/03/2004,8 months of ownership,4,"I have owned my Outlander for 8 months

stellar gas mileage at around 20mpg, 
and a paint and clear coat that seems 
to scratch quite easily. I just came 
home from a 2000 mile road trip, 
mostly highway driving, and the trip 
with my wife and two kids was quite 
enjoyable. The car was a little 
cramped with all of our stuff. Part of 
the trip was in very heavy rain at 
over 70mph, and the Outlander AWD held 
the road with no problem. I love the 
cupholders, the powerful Air

the stereo. All things considered I 
would buy this car again, "

disappointed. We liked & checked out 
the Honda CRV & Nissan Xterra. We took 
the Outlander for a 24hr test drive. It 
actually 
feet like a 6cyl! The exterior is 
similar to the Lexus RX300. I got 
used to the interior, not much to look 
at. We liked the Pontiac Vibe's 
interior better, but it sounded like a 
wind-up toy. The Outlander has a nice 
amount of space. You don't see too many 
on the road. Purchased for $21,000 & 
5,000 miles + warranties."

you put a fingernail on it, you will 
get a scratch.  if you buy one, get a 
light color like silver or white.  
Mileage is very poor compared to other 
similar sized vehicles.  i don't think 
they were truthful saying 20/27.  I get 
19/22, if i donot run the air"

in the other cars. I have also 
previously owned two Colts which were 
built by Mitsubishi and they never let 
me down. I am expecting the reliability 
of the Outlander to be the same. I have 
owned it for 5 months so far and am 
very impressed with it. I park at a 
local commuter train parking lot and

gas mileage, ability to transport goods

 I got it all with the Outlander.  It
has decnet acceleration but I don't want
a car to go 0 to 60 in 5.2 seconds.  I
am a point A to B type of guy and this
Outlander has suited me well.  Gas
mileage is 25 or better with mostly
highway miles.  I am a big guy and I am
quite comfortable in the drivers seat. 
Passengers have remarked they are very
cozy in the passenger seats.  I looked
quite a bit before I bought and the

great pickup, and handles very nicely.  
Of all the SUVs I tested, I think this 
one comes out on top.  Some had more 
space but not enough to over take the 
pluses of the Outlander.  After 1000 
miles I feel positive that I made the 
right choice.  The warranty upgrade 
also made this an easy pick.  
Performance + handling + warranty = 
sold.  After 3 tanks I'm getting around

quality, seating, etc) along with the 
performance and fuel economy, i was 
impressed. 

we make long trips (500+ miles)on the

mitsubishi,outlander,2004,Laura, 01/14/2006,I Like It,4,"I used to have a Subaru Impreza Outback Sport which I absolutely loved.  However, the Mitsubishi Outlander is a nice change because of the larger interior space and more height for better visibility.  For those who are taller, the slope of the windshield can make it a little difficult to see.  It handles fine, but if you are changing from a car, be prepared for different handling.

mitsubishi,outlander,2004,Frank Trobirdge, 11/08/2007,Great car,5,"I love this SUV. I drive it 30,000 miles a year and has 95K on it now and still runs like new. I have used it to haul my small camper and have really abused this car, but it continues to work like a dream. While its design is pretty extreme, it allows the car to look as new and trendy as the other crossovers being released today. I will keep this thing forever if I can, and if it dies, it am so pleased I am likely to go out and purchase another Outlander. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2004,polok420, 04/25/2008,Snappy,4,When I went to get financed for a car they said this is all I could get. (had a dying 95 escort). Wanted sporty and got it in sleeper mode. Has awesome handling. I have driven trucks and SUV's before but this handles like a car. It's interior could use a little help. Every thing rattles when have the bass up on the stereo.
mitsubishi,outlander,2004,Green Devil, 09/13/2018,The Green Demon,5,"Oh boy, I've had my green demon for almost two years, and has been a tank!. I got the car with 190k and I've personally put about 22k miles on it myself. This is an amazing car especially this model year because its the most reliable one. The biggest cost for me for the car was the timing belt and the pump which can be done by yourself. I got into an accident where my strut broke which made my steering off which I later fixed. I drove with the wheel in the wrong direction for about two weeks and still didn't give me any issues. Great car for a college student who wants a fun crossover car that's cheap to maintain. The only downside at the moment is my car won't pass smog lol! Has over 220k miles so keep that in mind folks.

mitsubishi,outlander,2004,Dean, 09/09/2019,A Super Lemon?,1,"I ran across this Edmunds site, and was shocked at the great reviews I saw for the 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander.  I expected to find many problems that I have encountered from this car since I first bought it in 2008.  I have paid for this Outlander twice (at least) in repairs and parts during the time I have had it.  The car has 116,000 miles.  It seemed that I could not drive the car fast enough from one service center to another to repair or replace the next part of this vehicle that decided to quit working. I even had to replace the entire All Wheel Drive system. Of all then cars I have had  over the years (20 cars), this Outlander has been my worst nightmare. I would rate the car a ""0"", if possible!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Delma, 05/21/2006,Great SUV,5,"This little SUV is just right for me.  It's got everything I need.  It's nice and roomy in the front and rear. Bottom line, I love my Outlander."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,lucymo, 06/28/2012,Reliable so far.,4,"LS model, FWD, automatic.
I purchased this car when it was 2 years old and had 26K miles on it. Now it's 7 years old and has 82K miles. I have had only one problem - with the steering column - that was taken care of through 5y/60k miles warranty. I do regular maintenance according to the manual.

While the LS model has a very spartan interior, it handles well. I replaced its very standard radio/CD player with an all-in-one player.

It's perfect for a small family of 2-3 people or a couple with dogs. Not enough pwr with 4 adults.
Mine has gas mileage of 22 mpg in the city and 26 mpg hwy.
I am very happy with it and will drive it to its end, hopefully many years and many miles away."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Christina, 12/10/2015,10 years later,3,"I bought this car brand new off the lot in 2005.  Within the first couple of years I had to have it repainted twice because it was already rusting. I had the bushings, control arms, tierods, and brakes replaced pretty much every year I've owned this thing, since the first year I bought it. I don't mistreat my car or drive it rough because I'm too paranoid something will go wrong with it. At 7 years the motor blew and the dealership refused to honor the warranty, despite it having 93,000 miles on it (well under warranty). The transmission was bad after the first year. The radiator had to be replaced after 8 years, even though it leaked since the first year I got it. The dealership wouldn't cover anything with my 10 year/100,000 mile warranty except the bushings. My window motor died after 9 years. The rear window windshield wiper died after 3 years. I feel I'm replacing the lights every 6 months, and at $35 a light, it adds up real quick. I've pretty much replaced every single thing on this car since the year I bought it, without any help from the dealership or warranty.  Now it's paid off, you better believe I'm going to drive the hell out of it for another 10 years because I've rebuilt the whole thing.  I paid $27,000 for this car, and I refuse to let it go out of sheer stubbornness, and not wanting to have to buy another car. BUT, I sure as heck will NEVER buy another one again. Wasn't ever worth the money. And I didn't even get the nice packaged one, it's just plain jane boring. I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone. It's hard to find parts for it, and everything costs a ridiculous amount.

mitsubishi,outlander,2005,paintrboy, 05/27/2012,"It's not a ""quality"" japanese SUV.",2,"We bought our Outlander 1 and half years ago from the dealer. Only 59K with lots of warranty left. Worked like well for the first 4 months then, $800 of front end work. New ball joints, tie rod ends, sway bar bushings etc. Then the gas tank started leaking another $1000. Then the transmission drive shaft seals began leaking (should have been covered under warranty) $300. New clutch kit, $800, new rear caliper $618 (yes, 1 ). Still needs new windshield, 4 struts, all new bushings again, doesn't start well after fuelling up and recently the power steering rack began leaking. It currently has 91K and we still owe $7000 on it. Dealer we purchased from said they'd buyback for $2200 firm. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,mikec, 08/22/2007,Would buy it again,4,"With almost 40000 miles on the SUV we have had zero repairs or work done on the vehicle.  For a 4 cylinder engine, performace is great.  Quick acceleration even with the AC on, 5 people and a load of cargo. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Tabby, 07/15/2010,Amazing!,4,"I just bought this car used a week ago. I love it, it handles just the way I like, like the Lancer platform it was built on. Hugs the curves just the way I like. Holds the road with almost NO body lean. It's incredibly fun to drive. My first SUV, and I'm in love with it. Lots of room and plenty of cargo cubbyholes. Plenty of room for my big dog to ride in the back. I have the Sun & Sound package and I love my Infinity sound system. Great gas mileage for an SUV."

mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Julie, 04/11/2006,Review of 2005 Outlander,3,"I am currently a little unhappy with the vehicle and the service.  I am having an issue with an odor when the air conditioning is on. The dealer said it is condensation that is becoming moldy.  They did not offer much help except to change the cabin filter, for a fee.  It seems like this is a warranty issue.  I haven't had the vehicle for a year, why would the air conditioning be leaking and getting moldy?  The odor is bad, especially on rainy days.  I wish I knew if others had this problem.  I am a little frustrated, it's gross!  That's my big complaint."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,camusgirl, 11/11/2006,Outlandish,4,"This is my second Outlander in three years after an AWFUL lease experience with Toyota where I will NEVER purchase another vehicle! Mitsubishi is right across the street and is wonderful to deal with, both in sales and service.  The Outlander does everything I need it to do and more!  Its gas mileage is above average (between 25 - 28 mpg) and its comfort is excellent with the lumbar package in the front leather seat.  The Sunroof and sounds make the ride a joy and it is not HIGH off the ground so even in evening wear with high heels I can slide into the seat comfortably. I cannot wait to purchase a 2007 with a V6!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Chuck, 02/19/2008,Better than expected,4,"After ""trying on"" several small SUVs, I decided this one has the best seat comfort which was my main criterion.  I was pleasantly surprised with the mpg and ergonomics of the unit as well.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for a small SUV with AWD."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Kaelyn, 09/05/2005,Good Purchase!,5,"This smaller SUV handles like a car, which is what I was looking for.  So far, it's been a smooth ride, not as bumpy as I would've expected.  I really love the cargo space & riding much higher than I'm used to in a conventional auto.  I've only had the car a couple of weeks, but have almost 1,000 miles on it as it's been fun driving it everywhere.  It's a purchase that has put a smile on my face!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Teresa, 12/05/2005,Back seats kill me,4,"We take lots of long road trips. The Mitsubishi Outlander is great on gas. I love driving it, but I absolutely hate riding in the back seat. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Eric, 05/29/2006,Better than expected,4,"The Outlander has car-like handling with no bad manners. This vehicle is easy to drive, park and has good visability. I am very impressed with the quiet ride on the highway. There is no wind noise and the seats are comfortable.  Its ride is stiff but very very solid. Its controls are simple. The 2.4L engine offers adequate power and is smooth. The transmission is also well matched to the engine and shifts smoothly, sport mode is great in town and with the cruise on it prevents downshifts. The stock 4 speaker stereo is average. The rear seats recline and that helps when installing a car seat. All Wheel Drive has no computer management like a Subaru but still helps in the snow. My truck has not had one problem in 25,000 miles."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,jpatulak, 06/07/2006,Mitsu Review,4,"Except for the gas mileage - way below advertised figures - this has been a great car. The AWD is best feature - the vehicle is excellent in snow and ice - teamed with the standard Yokohama Geolander tires the vehicle has super traction in adverse weather. The interior is well designed for driver comfort & ease. The only amenities it is lacking are heated outside mirrors and cross bars on the roof . The dealer service, so far, has been excellent. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Mitsu fan, 09/26/2006,One Fun SUV,4,"I bought this truck when my cute old Mitsubishi Mirage coupe got totalled in an accident in 2005. I was a Mitsubishi fan due to the fact that I never had a single issue with my 1997 Mirage for eight years, and this vehicle has reinforced my liking of Mitsubishi. My wife drives a Honda-CRV, and the Outlander definitely feels roomier in comparison when I drive (I am 6 feet tall). Add to that the 5 year/60000 mile warranty and an unbelievable price when I bought it (about $6,000 below sticker) and I was sold immediately. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Mary, 12/05/2007,Love this Car,4,"I love this car. I shopped around for a good used vehicle. I bought the Mitsubishi Outlander sight unseen. It came with a great warranty. I am really enjoying sitting higher in the vehicle than in a sedan. It has plenty of power for me. I also like the height to get in an out. It is just right for me. I don't have to use a sideboard. It gets better gas mileage than I expected. It hugs the road while driving and has great braking. It has a somewhat plain interior, but it is fine for me. The sound system is great also. It does everything I need. "

mitsubishi,outlander,2005,R C, 09/06/2010,Good SUV,4,"When I saw this SUV, I knew this was the one. It was different than all the other SUVs I had looked at! The interior looked like a German Interior and not Japanese. I really like our Mitsubishi Outlander, it has been a very reliable SUV. Performance is ok for normal drivers, but if your like me, there's not enough horsepower! My wife loves her SUV. It has been such a good vehicle, that I'm going to buy a new Mitsubishi Lancer GTS for my daughter. Good luck!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,MADJIMMY, 04/14/2005,Mitsubishi Outlander,5,"Finally found a small SUV that doesn't need the V6 to climb a paved hill!  This little gem is a powerhouse that is a blast to drive, looks great and is very nicely engineered.  Love the Sportronic automatic transmission, a flick of the wrist, and you down and up shift manually. The engine is a marvel, plenty of power in the 160+ horses packed into the 4 cylinders, power to spare and power to play with.  Roomy, comfy, and did I mention it is a great deal of fun?"
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Ali, 06/23/2005,Great Truck,4,I picked my Mitsubishi Outlander when I compared it to its competitiors. It's amazing. I have droven 2004 Ford Escape but found this one to be a better value.

mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Marcus, 08/16/2005,Serious Competition for Honda and Toyota,4,"I reviewed and tested the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Jeep Liberty and Mazda Tribute.  All of which had their pros and cons, but the Outlander seemed to be more of a compromise of all the pros.  My first choice would have been the Honda CR-V because I am a Honda loyalist comming from a Honda family. I might have even paid more for it.  However, since none of the 6 dealerships in my area treated me like I was a loyal customer I actually entertained other competitor's products.  I have to admit that I didn't know what I was missing.  There are better options to an over priced Honda.  Their reputation preceeds themselves and they take advantage of it.  Don't be sheep like I was."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,jaybruinboy, 12/08/2004,Great Value for Money!,4,"I purchased a 2005 Outlander LS 2WD a couple 
of weeks ago, silver, with the 
Convenience Package. I've driven it 
over 350 miles around Los Angeles, and 
so far I have mostly very good 
impressions of it. First, the looks--
nice lines, definitely not cookie 
cutter, and somewhat broad shouldered 
for a small SUV. People do ask what it 
is and take a closer look. Also, it does not have a  
spare tire hanging on the tailgate 
(which could bring you great grief if 
you get rear-ended). It will 
definitely not be lost in a sea of 
look-alikes at the parking lot. The iInterior looks great --
it should have a sign that says ""designed by Kenneth 
Cole."" Driving impressions--more than 
enough power, quiet at cruise.  Nice!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,bill, 03/24/2005,more power = more fun,4,If this vehicle were equipped with a V6 it would be the perfect rig for me.Could also use a slightly heavier suspension.Tires seemed to be a car- type variety rather than a truck tire. Would also like to see a manual transmission option.
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,xe2ac, 04/23/2005,Great driving,4,"After doing a careful driving tests with competing brands (Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Xterra). The best driving experience was with the Mitsubishi model I decided for this vehicle because I rarely drive on dirt roads and needed more cubic space than the Toyota. The CRV and Xterra are driven by a lot of women and the Outlander has a more muscular view. Problem on my city is the large amount of speed bumps and a lot of rugged asphalt which the suspension filters out very well. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Hal, 05/08/2005,Great but I Didn't have a need for it,4,I bought my Mitsubishi Outlander in December 2004 and just now traded it in for a Scion Xb. I drive a lot and I can't justify 21-27 mpg for me. I don't have a family.

mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Regggie, 07/19/2005,Outlander Review,4,"I was very fortuanate to get a vehicle that has a wood like interior. I added a muffler tip and a chrome license plate frame. Which really adds to beauty. The vehicle sits pretty low to the ground which allows it to ride like a car, but it is still an SUV.  I would reccomend this vehicle to any other. It's a great vehicle because I can fit my bike in it and still have room for freinds."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Melanie, 08/02/2005,Great little SUV,4,"The Outlander is great for the person that wants a vehicle large enough to haul everyday things, but doesn't want the huge, gas-guzzling monsters that are out there today!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Gina M., 08/21/2005,2003 Outlander,4,"Great small SUV for the money. Dependable. If you don't mind a little bumpy ride, this is a very inexpensive SUV to own. I have owned it since their debut in 2003. Gets through the bad winters, high enough to see well. Not great for carry more than 4-5 adults. Small cargo area. I like the truck a lot."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,RandyWakeman, 09/19/2005,Surprisingly Good,5,"This is an SUV that I didn't plan on buying, but after an ocean of test drives with other vehicles...I really tried to find a reason NOT to buy it, but I couldn't.  I'm was pleasantly surprised at how peppy the 2.4L MIVEC engine is - it sure feels like more than a 4-cyl., and has a lot more zip than some 6-cyl. vehicles that I tested.  It is extremely stable at high-speed; at 105 mph there is still some juice left (top end is about 120 mph). It has no problem keeping up with traffic when fully loaded. It's easy / fun to drive, comfotable, easy to park, and the cargo area becomes a cargo area by just dropping the seats - no headrests need to be removed. Just driving, no special attention nets me 22 mpg."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,Dan, 01/30/2006,Excellent Vehicle,4,"I looked at every single small SUV on the market in the $18,000 to $28,000 range.  I purchased the Outlander XLS FWD, Phoenix Red and the more I drive it the more I really like it.  It has more than enough power, especially when using the sportronic.  I think the steering is quite good, the brakes are excellent and the fit and finish both inside are quite good.  I would recommend it to anybody who needs a small space vehicle."
mitsubishi,outlander,2005,arjjm, 02/12/2006,Outlander is Great,4,The 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander is a great vehicle.  It stands out in a crowd as no one around here thinks to buy one of these.

Currently at 132,000 + miles I've only had to do the usual wear and tear maintenance. I did however change the water pump about 8 months ago.

I actually cried when the adjuster told me it was totaled, because I LOVED this car! We put 80,000 miles on it over the 4 years, and not once did we need a repair, except to replace the brakes at 90k.
I wanted to write this review because of how well it held up in our wreck. We were rear-ended while at a complete stop by a guy going 50.
We were thrown into the guardrail, but the only major damages were in appearance. The car held up extremely well, and none of us was injured. I was so impressed by how safe it was, I'm planning on buying another one! "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,alycop, 10/13/2013,The car survived the college student but not the accident,4,"I'll be honest, I am a college student and I did not maintain the car well.
I received the car in 2011 at 67k and the tires, battery and brakes needed to be replaced.
Since then I had nothing more than a burnt out headlight.
It ran great, got good highway mileage for an SUV, and had plenty of room.
Sometimes it would take a second turn of the key to start, but that was because I procrastinated (big time) on oil changes and such.
2.5 years and 30k miles later I had an accident after my tire blew from hitting a hubcap.
We spun out, I over corrected, slid to a ditch and rolled over.
I came out with out a scratch, my boyfriend got a mild concussion, but my poor car was totaled."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,spudhikes, 11/16/2012,Not for off road use,3,"Perfect on the road, crappy off of it.
Tiny rocks get caught between the brake rotors and the brake rotor covers.
Had them emptied six times in one year.
Drive dirt roads with the occasional rutted out section 3 times per week.
Broke the suspension over and over again.
Everything was perfect on the road, but off of it caused problems.
Sound system was great.
Heated front seats were amazing.
Seats easily stain, even from water.
Plenty of room for a 6'5"" guy.
Can't complain about anything on the pavement.
Can't suggest you use it off of the pavement.
Second Mitsubishi.
Will buy an older montero most likely.
Mitsubishi still rocks, just had the wrong one for day to day use."

Average cargo space, very comfortable with more than enough legs, head and shoulders space for 5 adults (or 2 adults, 2 child, and a baby seat). As I am living in a very hot country I found the AC is very effective in summer. The automatic gear is very responsive. I tried many other SUVs nowadays (e.g. Acadia, Pilot, Explorer, etc) and can't find any match to its powerful & responsive brakes. I was near the Oman tsunami in 2006 (in Sharjah Emirate) and this car saved me from drowning in water in low streets while similar SUV drowned (CR-V, Sportage, Vitara). But very low MPG in city."

We were impressed by the 100,000 mile warranty, 5 year roadside assistance, all the standard features, and the great gas milage.  The ride is nice, it has has plenty of pep for our conservative driving style. The vehicle seems well made, solid, and comforable. Of course, we gave up some room, however for an empty nest couple there is plenty of room for the luggage we take on our many trips.  My wife, being 5 foot 2, loves to drive it because the driver's seat elevates to give her the driving height she likes.

My best tank since I've owned the vehicle was 30 MPG!! And my worst was still at 22 so I cannot complain. I'm a teenager so I do enjoy a sporty ride, and this car delivers. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Snoop, 08/07/2009,Great Car,4,"It still amazes me that the resale value of these is so far below the CRV and the Rav4.  Makes picking up one lightly used a no-brainer.  The SE model exterior design blows away the rivals.  Great looking vehicle (SE/LTD - LS OK) and you won't see many (if any) on the road.  The engine has plenty of power even when entering/passing on the highway.  The Infiniti sound system is great.  Plenty of room on the inside, slightly less cargo space than the CRV & Rav4, but not by much.  Expected to run forever (150 - 200K easy) with little maintenance."

It rides very quiet and is very comfortable. I especially like the transmission, allowing to shift up and down on the go. The sound system is great.  I found that the rear wiper to be almost useless. It does not clean a large enough surface to allow for a clear vue, The rear wiper is a pain to change.  The plastic on which mudguards are mounted is beginning to deteriorate.  Gas mileage is disappointing from a 4 cyl. car.  I find the tires 215/55/17 to be oversize and the 94V rating in unnecessary for this car with a top speed of 120 mph. The windows and sunroof freeze when cold."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,glorkar, 06/30/2010,A Great Vehicle,4,"Purchased Used with 66,000 miles.  When I started looking for a different vehicle, the Outlander wasn't even on my list. But after I saw it and test drove it, I fell in love. The exterior is fairly aggressive and the seats are very comfortable. The ride is nice and smooth and it has been able to haul anything I needed. I have not needed the AWD yet but with winters in Wisconsin I'm sure it will come in handy. The mileage is ho-hum at about 20 mpg and it's not very peppy off the line, but I knew it wasn't a race car when I bought it. The mesh cloth seats are great. Even though they are darker, they are cool to the touch even in 85 degree weather."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Alex L, 07/13/2006,The Best Bang for my Buck,4,"I had never even heard of the Outlander. I didn't want another Honda CR-V or Ford Escape like everyone on my block. The wife saw it first. The more I checked it out the more I liked it too. It was overall exactly what we needed at the time. The deciding factors were its good gas mileage, interior space, reasonable price, color and the desire to own something different. It could use more power and two more seats though.  I'm still more than satisfied with this buy. I love when people ask ""Hey what is that, its cool lookin."" I personally love the silver color. Well that's my rewiew"
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Ghost, 07/14/2006,Fun,4,"This is the second Mitsubishi I have owned, not including my TV <wink>... They are great cars and are very reliable. I test drove an Outlander a year ago, but was not quite ready to purchase one. Now I wish I had then. Even though this is a ""base"" model it has lots of perks like power locks, power windows, a decent stereo and rear defogger. This is stuff you would pay extra for on some of the other small SUV's.    The 5-speed transmission is pretty responsive and, in reality, it has plenty of power for a SUV this size. It is also larger than it looks. I was suprised how much the size was comparable with my 2001 Jeep Cherokee.  I really have enjoyed mine. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Tom, 05/03/2009,Compact SUV for cheaper price!,4,"We didn't really expect the power on this car since it is only a 4 cylinder but it's a great car for the city.  We like its rear where it is easier to open unlike Rav 4.  We also like that this vehicle is not so up high.  My wife is short and we also have a Tacoma so this is a good car for her.  Stereo system sounds great.  More room for small family.  However, the highway ride is a bit rough and noisy.  I am so used to my Tacoma.  The power mirror control is a bit out of reach when trying to adjust during the drive.  I also agree with some other reviewers that the radio needs to be closer, maybe on the steering wheel.  Interior material for LS is a bit cheap but the seats can be covered up."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Mawingo, 07/29/2009,"Unexceptional, but that's a good thing",3,"This is an after the fact review, as I just traded this one in. This car did nothing well, but nothing bad. It was just sort of there and didn't leave a bad taste. It's comfortable (the seats are very firm), got decent mileage, and didn't require a lot of non-routine maint; just oil changes, tires, brakes, and an AC recharge (common to this model). It's a little short on power, but proved to be reliable. The interior wore well."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,jam, 09/07/2005,Great small SUV,4,"The fastest SUV on the market for less than $40,000. The triptonic gear box works great, even better than my 2001 Audi A4.  This truck is smooth and fast, with young and sporty looks.  I love that is not very common. In fact is hard to find.    "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Maggie, 02/15/2006,Commuter's SUV,5,"If you want a commuter SUV, the Mitsubishi Outlander is it.  It handles like a car, is solid, has good fuel economy, and best of all a low price tag.  It hugs the road and makes the driver feel safe.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,djenkins, 05/29/2006,"Great value, overlooked SUV",4,"It is strange that this SUV crossover does not get better professional reviews.  Everywhere I look on the net, the people who actually own one are very happy with it while pro editorial reviewers usally give mediocre reviews.  It gives great value, luxury car level comfort and a modern, aggressive styling both in and out.  I have the Limited version with leather.  It really upgrades this entry level SUV to a luxury entry level and its double sunroofs are a nice feature. The 4-cyl. 2.4liter MIVEC engine gets the job done nicely and feels faster then it actually is. Its handling is tighter and more sport sedan-like than ALL of it's competitors including the new RAV4. I tested all of them and this one is tops, I have no regrets."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,bmwadam, 04/07/2007,Good for its class,4,"My wife bought this car back in December of 2005. We have over 30,000 miles on it now and have had any problems whatsoever. It has NEVER been to the dealer, I do all of the maintenance myself and the car is very easy to work on for the home mechanic. Good gas mileage for its class. All around a good deal for someone that is wanting a compact, SUV. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Luna, 07/20/2008,A lot of car for the money,5,"I just love the look of this car! I test drove all of the competition of  approximately the same year, 2006 and nothing looked or handled as well as this vehicle. I am still impressed with how solid it is, yet how sporty it is to drive. I also am astounded at the great gas mileage. My boyfriend has a Jetta and the Outlander gets a bit better gas mileage! I need the space to haul things for my gallery as well as a car to do errands and take clients out. This car can do it all. I am extremely pleased. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Nopamo, 11/21/2009,Mitsubishi weekender,4,"Bought this outlander in October and it has been a perfect fit since.  I was looking for a car like suv and found outlander fitting in utility and price.  It has fit into our lifestyle as a weekend and vacation get away mobile. It's perfect as a secondary car especially when you want to give your daily commute car a break.  The money you'll save could be used on enjoying your destination. Our outlander is adequately powered for getting here to there.  All the necessary comforts for the drive are present including a more than comfortable and roomy passenger space.  Four medium sized people will seat very easily.  Five is do-able for shorter trips. Back seats recline, but will sacrifice cargo."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,northsidefan, 10/11/2005,Very Satisfied - Great for Price,4,"For the little extra money, it was worth upgrading to the SE model.  The only feature that I wanted and was not included was a power moonroof.  Otherwise, I am very happy with the purchase."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Louana and Racquel, 12/25/2005,Most Fun for an SUV at Such a Great Price,5,"I love the way the 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander drives and I would recommend it to anyone that needs a little extra room without having a big gas bill. I have one other SUV, but this one is the most fun to drive."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Terri, 12/27/2005,Downsizing from Minivan,5,"I chose the 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander due to the 100,000 mile warranty - no other manufacturer came close. I keep my vehicles for at least 10 years so this was the deciding factor. It is a great truck, handles well and coming from a Plymouth Grand Voyager and the size is very adequate for my needs. Of course, we would all like to see a little better gas mileage with today's gas prices."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,WHW, 01/03/2006,Nice Truck,4,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander is a good, dependable, affordable alternative to larger SUV's. I very much like and enjoy driving this vehicle. I've always had larger SUV's but got tired of the gas prices and vehicle costs associated with them. The Outlander handles, rides, and performs very well for the price. It's worth looking into if you, as well, are tired of the high prices involved with the larger SUV's."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Bud, 03/09/2006,An Eye Catching SUV,5,"The Outlander is a great deal for the money with one of the best warranties out there on the market. This is the second Mitsubishi I have owned with my trading in a Galant for the Outlander SE. I reached for five months before buying the Outlander and what kept me coming back to the Outlander was the warranty, the outside look of the SUV and the overall qaulity of the SUV. It gets great gas mileage for an SUV with nice pick up and go with a stylish look inside and out."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,walter, 11/15/2005,Sharp Looking and Comfortable,4,"My 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander handles like a car, it takes corners nicely. The body looks like a mix of a BMW and a Lexus. The anti-lock brakes are a plus. It's mileage should be a little better though since its only a 4-cyl.  It still has good pep driving in the manual way.  The cargo area should be a little deeper and the back seats should lay flat.  The storage in the dash needs to change, it needs to slant it so everything doesn't fly out when you take off.  Overall, this is a very nice value for the money.  It's sharp looking and handles well."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,don williamson, 05/06/2006,2006 Outlander AWD,5,The 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander is exactly the right SUV for our needs. It performs better than expected.
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,jam, 10/18/2005,Fun and Fast,5,"My 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander has been an incredible surprise.  It is fast and fun. Price vs. quality, it is one of the best options out there in the American market."
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,lonestar1914, 11/11/2005,A Surpisingly Fun Toy to Drive,5,I was very surprised at the handling of the Mitsubishi Outlander. For a small SUV it really excellerates well.  This is a good vehicle for a first time buyer. 
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,T.CAGLE, 01/29/2006,Outlandish,4,"I have only owned my 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander for a month, but I have been thrilled with it.  It has quite a bit of pep and handles really well. I have been fairly pleased with the gas mileage. I am not disappointed with buying the vehicle  I would recommend the Outlander to anyone looking to buy a small SUV. And it just looks tough!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,meagain076, 03/06/2006,Love this truck!,5,"I just bought my 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander this weekend.  I fell in love with the design, and the sportiness of it.  It is well worth the low price tag, and it is very fun to drive.  It handles well on corners, though the pickup from start is a little slow.  The gas mileage is great.   Overall I am very happy with my purchase!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Ryan, 01/23/2007,Great Small AWD SUV...,5,I traded in my Mitsubishi Endeavor for the Outlander.  I love the Outlander's aggressive styling.  The handling of this car is amazing as well.  I'd recommend this SUV to anyone.
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Gooch, 02/09/2007,Great Crossover,4,"I bought a 2006 Certified Used Outlander AWD. I got the 100,000 mile powertrain and 5 yr / 60,000 mile bumper to bumper, no deductible warranties. What other car company has a warranty like that! ZERO..  I had a 1998 Ford Explorer with 50,000 miles prior to the Outlander. I put over $3,000 in repairs into it in the last two years. I was looking for a quality vehicle, I found that in the Outlander. I am sold on Mitsubishi. The Outlander is a great crossover vehicle, it is fun to drive and handles great.  I live in Western PA and the winters are nasty. I feel 100% safer in the Outlander than I ever did in the Explorer and the AWD hardly has to kick in.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,sarah, 04/24/2007,Happy Purchase,4,"When I was looking through possible vehicles to purchase upon a move to snowy Minnesota, I met with a dealership that found the Outlander would match my needs.  While I wasn't a big fan of the outer appearance, it was nice to look at a car that wasn't exactly the same as all the other small SUVs.  I ended up buying the car after checking out some of it's competitors (i.e. CRV, VUE, RAV4) and have found my Outlander to be a terrific buy.  I think it is very comfortable, with a simple, clean interior.  I would recommend this car to someone looking for a smaller AWD vehicle.   "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,Ebough, 09/11/2007,Love It,4,"I just bought my 2006 Outlander after almost eight years driving a Ford SHO. I wanted a truck, but we picked the Outlander as a compromise. After years of driving a very powerful, low profile car, the Outlander took a lot of getting used to. However, once I was comfortable I love it. I hate super plush cars, so this is a great compromise between a car and a truck - and honestly, with Mitsubishi's road rally experience, I expect to be able to get out of my driveway many mornings without snowblowing. Once I get my first scratch I might go down some dirt roads.  If you're looking for something with quick acceleration, this is not the car. But it does cruise quite nicely. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2006,fratomdev, 10/02/2007,What a Deal! A quality Vehicle,4,"I researched every mid level SUV out there on every car site I could find. What got me to look at the Outlander was that I couldn't find any complaints from people that bought a used one. The same was not true for the RAV4, CRV, Ford Escape or the Forester. I originally was going to buy a 2007, but decided to test a used 2006 LS AWD. Both my wife and I felt the 2006 was quieter and road better. I haven't driven in the snow, but I am sure it will be great up here in Syracuse where we get 160"" a year, thus why I wanted an AWD. The interior is big compared to my Camry. The quality is impressive."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,wymanc, 11/27/2006,Best Bang for the Buck,4,"I just bought an Outlander ES and was surprised by the performance along with the list of standard features.  Originally I was set on the new Honda CR-V, but felt it was too weak.  My second choice was the Toyota RAV4, but I felt that the V6 engine was way too expensive.  The Outlander is the perfect middle ground. I'm used to driving sporty cars and was surprised by how much better it handles than vans / SUVs I've driven in the past.  The only negative I can think of right now is the fact the second row seats don't fold all the way flat down."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Michael Graham, 02/22/2016,Reliable Reliable Reliable !!!,5,"I drove this car for 9 years without a hitch. The only money I spent was on Tires 1x Spark plugs 1x Brakes 1x Shocks 1X  OIl Changes Filters etc.
117000 miles and never needed a repair. The only reason I did not buy a new one is they no longer have a V6 only a 2.0 liter  four cylinder  or a 2.4 liter four cylinder. I loved the reliability of this car. I never owned a car for 9 years before usually buy new one every three years.

mitsubishi,outlander,2007,ANiceRide, 12/04/2006,Bang for the Buck!,4,"So far, I love this chariot!  It's a nice ride. I purchased an Outlander XLS 4WD with navigation, the Sun & Sound package, and the Luxury package. THE GOOD:  Engine power is adequate, (not afraid to pull out in traffic.) Fuel Economy is OK. (I'm seeing about 22-23 MPG in mixed driving.) Sound System w/ NAV is VERY NICE!  Leather, heated seats, Bluetooth, sunroof, paddle shifters - nice and roomy, excellent warranty - all for just under $30,000 MSRP. (That's a bargain in my book - even more so considering I paid well under MSRP). THE BAD: Yes, it does have some wind noise around the A- pillars at highway speed. (But I just turn the stereo up!) In FWD mode there is a good amount of torque-steer when footing it (this is fine in 4WD Auto Mode)."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Jeff, 01/20/2007,Wow!,5,"I currently own a 2004 Outlander, so I'm familiar with the quality of the brand. My wife traded her 2005 Subaru Outback for the 2007 XLS 4WD. We absolutely love this car. The ride is great and the vehicle is fun. I tried to talk her out of the navigation system, but we got it and it is awesome. The wheels, stereo, and of course the engine are all quite an improvement over the 2004 model. We compared it to the CR-V, Saturn, Toyota and Subaru (Outback and Tribeca) and nothing comes close to matching the engineering marvel of this vehicle. Note: there is no new car leather smell to this vehicle.  The odor absorbing headliner keeps the car smelling, well, clean. Which is nice, since we have dogs. Give this car a look"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Rick, 10/07/2015,Sporty Crossover,5,"I drove a lot of crossovers  before buying my Outlander. It was the most fun to drive with great handling and awesome acceleration . It has also been one of the most Reliable  vehicles  I have ever owned .  I've only had it in for repairs  for a minor exhaust problem, otherwise  just routine  maintenance . Update: in 2017 4 months after the emissions warranty expired, one of the catalytic converters went out. The Mitsubishi dealer wanted at least $2,000 to replace just the converter, another grand if the O2 sensors were bad. I took it to the local shop and had the converter and both O2 sensors done for $1200. I found out that Denso made the O2 sensors and Mitsubishi jacked up the price when they put their name on them. Besides the problem with my Outlander I still love it and love driving it.
BTW my friends Outlander saved her life when she was T-boned by truck.
After 10 years of ownership I still love this car.

mitsubishi,outlander,2007,TKO, 11/28/2006,A Lot of Car for a Little Money,4,"I have only had the car for a short time, but I haggled about what to buy for three weeks, test driving all kinds of cars. The only one I could compare this drive to would be the Subaru Tribeca, which was like $5,000 more expensive and took premium gas. I don't think you could get a vehicle filled with more features that drives as well as this for the same money. Don't be scared off by the estimated gas mileage either, I have been averaging around 22 MPG, which is not that bad."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,joe.arismendy@yahoo.com, 08/03/2015,Very Reliable SUV,4,"In terms of reliability this vehicle is tops, got it used with about 73k miles has been very reliable with no major problems did replace the front brake rotors and pads at about 90k miles but other thant just the basic service oil changes filters etc. the only problem has been the front door windshield gaskets let in a lot of road noise at speed have seen this reported by other people here and the turnn signal need a chime because they will remain on if you don't notice, again not so much to worry about with this vehicle and mileage is good for a V6.

mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Tim S., 11/10/2006,Exceptional Vehicle,5,"I am very impressed with everything about this vehicle.  I test drove the vehicle the day it came out (Friday Nov 3rd, 2006), and it blew my mind.  I test drove the Honda CR-V, the Jeep Compass, Toyota RAV4, and the Outlander blew them out of the water.  Its turning radius, acceleration, and handling are absolutely amazing.  The one thing I was a little skeptical about the 27/20 gas mileage until I drove it to work and averaged 23 MPG!  Are you kidding me?  A 220HP V6 SUV averaging 23 MPG that's not a hybrid?  All I can say is WOW."

So when I saw that Mitsubishi had a new Outlander coming out I test drove it and got rid of the Toyota. The quality amazed me. I didn't expect it from Mitsubishi. I read all the time about Mitsubishi doing things wrong. I think they're seriously underrated. I'm very satisfied. I love the fast key. The Outlander is big, but it's cool and the paddle shifters are NICE!  The 3rd row is more for kids than adults. The a/c is amazing!  In the previous review something was said about torque steer, I haven't really encountered it at all. I could go on about this. Mitsubishi has REALLY stepped up on this one. You can't beat the price and warranty!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Loveit, 11/22/2006,Good SUV,5,"My wife and I looked at the Outlander, CR-V, Santa Fe, and RAV4.  For the price and what you get it, the Outlander beats all of them.  It comes with a better warranty, 4 wheel drive, a good looking interior and exterior, great safety features, and it's roomy.  The CR-V we looked at had no 4 wheel drive, only a 4-cyl. engine, less horsepower, and a shorter warranty for a higher price.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,blackb13, 11/25/2006,This truck is awesome!,5,"Mitsubishi hit the nail on the head with this one.  I test drove the competition: the CX-7, RAV4, CR-V, Murano, Santa Fe and Tribeca.  Nothing came close for features, quality, and price.  The Murano and Tribeca had slightly more front legroom, but aside from the small details, I couldn't justify the price. The CX-7 was OK (no BT feature), but couldn't justify the premium fuel requirement. Honda and Toyota weren't willing to deal at all (nasty attitude). Hyundai had no features and poor gas mileage. Our Outlander came loaded with HID's, LED tails, Navigation, Bluetooth, heated leather seats, and a 5yr/60k bumper to bumper, 10yr/100k powertrain warranty. FYI, you can get beige or black leather depending on color."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,matterie, 08/20/2012,"Great, but beware the Paint",3,"Had this car for about 5 years now. Overall, we have been very pleased with it except for one issue: the paint.
The clear coat appears does not appear to be of quality resulting in a car that scratches easy and a result, looks pretty awful after a short period of ownership.

The built-in media center was cool at first, but is a bit annoying with expensive map updates and the inability to load MP3's on the hard drive. It will only load from original music CD's (or WAV files).

Minus the paint, reliability has been very good."

My wife loves the sunroof, and I love the sound system (subwoofer is my favorite part!).  Our daughter sits high enough to finally see out of the window and I have peace of mind with the Anti-skid control and enough airbags for any situation. The gas mileage is great for an SUV, but obviously not as good as our Nissan Altima. The XLS model is worth the extra money!  We love this SUV!  It has the best warranty available and the customer service is extremely pleasant."

We were almost going for the RAV4 , after evaluating CX-7, CR-V, Tribeca, when the Outlander came out. The Outlander is by far the best value for money for this segment. Its fun owning a car with a super cool navigation system, music system, Bluetooth combined with a V6 and not so useful but yet handy 3rd row seat. I am just waiting for the NHTSA crash test results, and if it gets a 5 star rating, then I am totally satisfied with what I got. Despite all the negative history on Mitsubishi, this vehicle rocks!"

I wanted a crossover for good gas mileage and handling.  Nothing else out there gives you the features in terms of safety, comfort, technology, and styling that you will find in the Outlander.  Don't get the ""It's a Toyota, or Honda"" name sell you.  The material quality is not a 10, but seriously feel its competitors and it's on par, but with a MUCH better execution.  It's quite and comfortable.  It's like driving a lifted car.  It provides sporty performance with great gas mileage.  The warranty is another factor to consider.  I traded in a Jeep Liberty and couldn't be happier.  Don't be scared about first year model, its been out in Japan for a couple of years."

After reading a lot of positive reviews of the RAV4 we test test drove it and it was a bit of a let down. The engine was great however everything else was not.  The interior design is very old ladyish.  My wife and I agreed on this. Also, the great gas mileage that the RAV4 sports is offset by the required premium fuel which translates into a 2.5 miles per gallon reduction from 29 to about 26-27 mpg when price adjusted for premium fuel when compared to outlanders regular unleaded needs. The Nissan Murano was nice, but way too expensive and interior felt too ritzy and not sporty enough. "

Turns out that it gets better mileage than the 4 cyl. and has tons more power.
I'm not a big fan of the transmission, which hesitates slightly when accelerating from a stop light (almost like a delay between gas pedal and actual go).
There are foot wells under the front seats, which are great for taller backseat passengers.
We now have 200,000 km on this vehicle (15,000 the first 10 days we owned it) and, aside from a transfer case seal and squeaky rear shocks (both replaced under warranty, it has been regular maintenance only.

I've only had it for less than a month, but this SUV is so much fun to drive, and surprises me constantly. I keep finding great features (see below). Engine sounds an looks great, build seems solid, great look, and an awesome value (especially used). "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,mikal69, 10/05/2012,awesome sleeper car,4,"only had my Outie for a few months, but she has been great, you get a lot of quality for the used price, liked it better than the typical Toyotas and Hondas, and better build quality than pretty much everything else in it's range, it's no BMW or Mercades though. sporty ride and steering, and perfect for those of us 6ft plus. lots of room. Love that the back seats recline and adjust, so that the person sitting behind me isn't cramped. overall, a really really nice Suburban Utility Vehicle, just wouldn't trust it off-road."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Ilikeit, 11/21/2006,Quality SUV for the Price,4,"We looked at the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, and Hyundai Sante Fe.  The pluses for Outlander include its 5yr/60000 bumper to bumper, 10yr/100,000 pwr train and 5yr/unlimited roadside assistance.  It also had the V6 engine and 4 wheel drive.  The CR-V we looked at had a shorter warranty, no 4 wheel drive, less horsepower and a 4-cylinder engine, with a higher price tag.  The safety features and interior were comparable.  So far we are very pleased with our choice for the short time we have had it. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,tommybo76, 11/30/2006,Best SUV for the Money,5,"My wife and I love this SUV.  It gets great gas mileage, has lots of great interior features, a 10 year warranty, and all the safety features standard.  This is a great SUV for the money."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Alvey, 01/08/2007,Wow!,4,"The Outlander an amazing vehicle all around!  It has lots of room, the back seats recline and move forward, and back and best of all is it has a left hand cup holder for the driver right by steering wheel!  The doors are hard to close and the u-joints are not very good, but other than that, this is an awesome vehicle.  It is so cool.  The third row seating is perfect for a young family!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,tnk, 04/20/2016,best vehicle I've haf,5,"It is so reliable...I have had cars in the past the need too much work. This car just needs your basic maintenance. I'm at 190,000 with miles still runs great (knock on wood).

mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Whitney, 12/19/2006,A Must Buy!,5,"I just purchased the Outlander XLS 2WD today!  I have to say, after searching for the past six months and doing some homework, this is the car to get.  I test drove the CR-V, CX7, and Santa Fe, plus the old Trailblazer (previously owned).  There is no comparison, this is the best and a definite MUST buy!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,evolander, 12/29/2006,Outeverything!,4,"The Outlander handles like a car - a good handling car at that. It's quiet, there is nothing is flimsy in the interior. The vehicle fully equipped is an amazing value with many features the competition doesn't even offer. The transmission is very adept at shifting and selecting gears.  Its gas mileage is right about what you would expect for a mid-sized sedan. With electronic brakeforce, all wheel drive, and a six speed trans, this vehicle is sure-footed to say the least. The sound system is fantastic. I could go on and on but it scores very highly across the board. There is a knock that we hear in the suspension and some wind noise around the mirror, but we're still happy and will get that fixed.  This truck has no real flaws and has had no failures."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,FST, 07/14/2009,Great vehicle,4,"Bought as a leftover model. Had a 2003 previously. Love the keyless entry & ignition. Key never comes out of my pocket. Getting 24 + for mileage. 3rd row seating useless for us, may never be used. Our 2 dogs like all the room available with the 2nd row seats folded. Liked the spare (2003-2006) up inside rather than under as with the models with the 3rd seat. We like the styling , and it is comfortable to take a trip with. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,rcpax, 12/01/2006,My new '07 Outlander,5,"This SUV has everything I can ask for, and much more. The engine gives a good response, the handling is superb, and the tech toys are abundant.  this truck is way more than I would imagine for the price. The overall package for the price cannot be beaten by any competitor. The Outlander has all the qualities I could want for an SUV."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,usafwifey, 11/14/2011,Best deal around!,4,"I purchased my Outlander used with 58,000 miles on it. I have put 2000 miles on it since then and I love it! This car is the best deal in its class! I shopped around for about 3 months before purchasing this car and looked at a Nissan Rogue, Xterra, Kia Sorento, and a Santa Fe previously. The Outlander is able to provide the best quality, most fatures, and best reliability for the money! I have a feeling my next car will be a newer Outlander!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,20vcq, 10/17/2007,Painful Like-affair,3,I want so much to like this vehicle. Drives well under 140 kmph and gets very floaty and a little twitchy over that. AWD is not up to quality and useability of either Subaru or Audi - not by a long way. But it's o.k. Road noise is higher than I would have expected and clangy doors are a disapointing sound. The auto transmission is my biggest disappointment. 6 speeds and paddle shifters are cool but the constant downshifting and that annoying 400 rpm drop after every downshift makes long trips less than as enjoyable. 
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,rdbmpls, 12/22/2010,2 year review,4,"I am a normal person in that I am not a car snob nor a gear-head. In a vehicle, I only want a few things first and foremost I want a reliable vehicle that gets me from point A to point B. I want a vehicle that makes me feel comfortable while driving in it. I live in Minneapolis, MN and am 64 so I need a vehicle that can drive through sloppy/snowy weather and this vehicle can get that done. It also gets good highway MPG(23-27Highway MPG)
(only ok if continually driving in the city:14-17MPG)
If you are looking for a reliable, small SUV, that offers solid features at a good price, purchase the Outlander. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Bill W, 02/19/2017,Best vehicle I've ever owned,5,"I've owned well over 20 vehicles, including several Datsun/Nissan ""Z"" cars, a classic 1987 BMW 325, Fords, Chevys, and VW's.  None has ever proven as reliable as my 2007 Outlander XLS purchased new on December 31, 2006.  11 years later it still looks and runs as new and has never let me down.  If I had a complaint road noise at 70MPH is quite a bit noisier than, say, a Lexus.  Then again it's far less expensive to buy, insure, and maintain.  I'd buy it again!

mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Dave, 10/30/2017,Yes yes yes.,5,"160,000 miles, a battery. An alternator, 2 headlights.  That’s it.  This is everything you could ask for in a rig.

"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,arwood, 06/18/2012,Love it!,4,"I bought my 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, used with just under 50k miles on it, in 2010 when I graduated college. The first month I had it I drove it from AZ to AK! Very Comfortable. Didn't have a single problem. I have now lived in AK for over 2 years and have driven in all the craziest weather conditions and couldnt be happier! It gets decent gas mileage, I love that I can switch on AWD whenever I need it, the sound system is AWESOME and I always get complimets on how nice it is. I went from driving a sports car to this and I love my Mitsubishi and would definitely buy another!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,lessygirl84, 07/23/2012,Love my 2007 Outlander,4,"I bought my 2007 Outlander from a Mitsubishi dealership in 2010. It was a used rental car and I was really concerned when I bought it but I have read so many wonderful things about them so I took a chance. The only thing I have done to it is maintinence. I have changed the oil, bought new tires, and changed the transmission fluid. It runs smooth and has almost 90k miles on it. My mechanic/Uncle said he was very impressed by how clean the undercarriage is. (It takes a lot to impress him) At Christmas my mother told me that I couldn't possibly fit my three children including my infant, in the car with their bikes and presents but I did. It wasn't cramped but there was not a ton of room left"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,gardengroveguy, 11/08/2006,A Bit Disapointed!,4,"This new Outlander is light years ahead of the outgoing one. It even rates above the new Rav4 and C-RV, in most respects. It is a better value, more stuff, and great quality. And here comes the ""but!""  This thing has the worse case of torque steer that I have experienced since I owned a 200 hp front wheel drive Fiat! Stomp on the gas and you better be holding onto that steering wheel, with both hands. And she wanders on the freeway, it feels like it's up on tip-toes...wandering! And bring your Dramamine, because the rocking movements caused by diving when braking and accelerating will cause sea-sickness! Nice effort Mitsu...but you missed out on the important stuff...like being able to drive it smoothly!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Anthony, 01/01/2016,Decent SUV but I'm never again buying Mistubishi,4,"I liked this truck from day one.  We lucked out getting it in such good condition.  The truck was getting older and I didn't notice the rust damage underneath.  However, the engine was good, the interior was clean and unmarred; she drove nicely.  Still, there was a lot that needed to be changed after the first year, being the truck was 69,000 miles in.  The tires, belts, filters, and battery all needed replacing.  Not the worst except the battery was annoying.  However the engine required a tune up; there was an issue with the timing belt which could have caused an engine seize and car being totaled if we hadn't caught it. Then the damned intake manifold went.  The truck is great the problem is Mitsubishi is one of the worst companies to deal with in regards to parts and service.  You have to use their parts and those parts are NOT CHEAP.  We lived with a non-working key fob (no lock/unlock) which would only have unlocked the front driver side door.  I have to say decent vehicle, but bad product support by the company.  This will be our last mistubishi, as a result. Traded her in after almost 2 years...and didn't get near anything to what we paid for her.

mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Andrzej, 04/30/2009,Very nice car I enjoy driving it,4,"It would be really difficult for me to say what I don't like about this car. Everything is in place and works very well. Driving is definitely pleasant. Engine is quiet and IMHO very powerful. I would buy Outlander again, however this time with navigation and video built-in. We have quite a lot of snow during winter and this car works perfectly on icy road. No complaints at all. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,So sad, 02/19/2008,So so,3,Not unhappy but not thrilled either. It is a truck with nice seats that you can't get rid of without a lot of time. The 3rd row is annoying waste of space and the paint protection is very poor. The car looks old now with a new paint job needed below the waist of the car. Nice engine though 
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,euler21, 12/29/2006,Extremely Happy!,4,"I just got my Outlander LS 4WD a week ago, and I think I just might be in love.  I've always owned GMs, but I needed an SUV for the headroom (6'4"").  Most SUVs have terribly boring styling, but this thing is beautiful!  It just looks like nothing else on the road.  I traded in an '04 Grand Prix, and I love the fact that I can fit in a vehicle, without it feeling like a massive SUV."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Pib, 01/07/2007,Nice SUV,4,"I hadn't planned on looking at the Outlander as I'd never heard of it.  I'm glad that I found out about it!  Compared it with CR-V, RAV4, Santa Fe, etc...which are all fine vehicles, the Outlander hit all the right points on what I was looking for.  What I especially like is that it gives me almost all the things I would want in a larger SUV in a smaller and more fuel-efficient size."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,gene guy, 03/07/2007,Redesigned Outlander,4,"Since buying the newly redesigned Outlander LS we have been extremely pleased with its styling, driveability, and quality. Many of the features that are present in this ""small SUV"" give the impression of a vehicle that cost more than it actually did. Its good stability on the highway and an excellent braking system lend themselves to a feeling of a secure, stable platform and ride. We really enjoy this vehicle. And one final thing, the low profile drop down rear gate really helps when you are trying to load things into the back cargo area."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,J, 10/05/2007,Great value SUV,4,"Owned 10 months, driven 11,000 miles, & this is my take. Solid, responsive, fun to drive, overall great vehicle for the price. Have done a couple of 1000 mile road trips & found it to be very comfortable & a great performer. Am astounded with morning commute fuel economy being consistently over 30 mpg. Freeway average is 23-24 mpg, which is okay but expected more given commute mpg is so high. Pet peeves - the all round low quality interior, hard to see orange display in sunlight, & wind noise on drivers side. Observations - can be awkward getting cup in/out of holder with arm rest pulled forward, & swaying in high wind on freeway. If improvements below were made, would definitely buy again!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Brian, 11/19/2007,A Great Standout,4,"This car is great for its class and offers more for the money than any of the competition's. It looks good and is very fun to drive. It is an athletic yet comfortable car that has always been great so far. It is faster and more agile than most other small SUVs and has a host of great standard features. I also really like the gauge computer and the 6-speed auto is unheard of in this class. Also, the 4WD system is great and I highly recommend it for buyers who encounter snow and slick road conditions like I do."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Mario, 03/16/2019,my hero,5,"Got it 5 years.Real blast to drive,very agile,excellent on gas,is doing what i need it for 100%.Every year im going on trip from east to west coast,no problem.Roomy,good storage,cheap to buy but very well made and durable,did not have any problem with it only oil and filter,thats it .3 litter engine is great and drive great on snow.Parts are cheap for it,too.Will buy new one with 3 .0 engine[i sad goodbye to GM long time ago].If  you considered buying one,dont hesitate get one you wont be sorry.update: 180000 and still going strong.no problems at all.loved this car.

mitsubishi,outlander,2007,100% Satisfied!, 12/30/2019,Best Of The Best 2007,5,"I have never been more impressed with a vehicle than I have with the Outlander. At 221,000 miles its been an amazing ride. Luv the power, the sporty driving, the multiple choices with the AWD and ability to lock front and rear drive..a huge plus in deep snow! Its been the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned with no failures of any components even at 200,000+ miles. Great interior, 3rd row seating. I passed it on to my daughter and it will remain in our family for many more miles I'm sure!
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,mchrist152, 01/17/2020,This has been a great vehicle,5,"I bought this car new and it now has 113,000mi on it. I have had no problems with the car and all I have had to do is standard maintenance. I haven't even touched the brakes yet as the original ones still work great. I have towed a pop up camper with it to no adverse effect. It's great in the snow, looks good and handles like a sports car. I don't know why Mitsubishi went away from this styling as they haven't come up with something better since. I changed the timing belt changed at 105,000mi as recommended by Mitsubishi. As a longtime owner, I highly recommend this vehicle
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Dan, 01/12/2010,Great for the Price,4,"This is our second Outlander (owned 2003).  Was happy then and am very happy now.  Bought this one used with all the options exc. Nav.  This car, even with substandard interior materials and pronounced road noise is super fun to drive.  My wife likes all of the storage in my Outlander.  Road noise is pronounced but the stereo is out of the world. If you live in a pot hole infested area I would not recommend the car, but the highway ride is super smooth. This is the best used SUV. Overall for the money this is the car to buy. While its not perfect, it offers more stuff and good reliability for not much money in used format.  I'm considering already buying a 2010 used in 2010."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Adam, 11/17/2006,The Best,5,The 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander is a very nice vehicle.  I think it's the best.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Mike, 12/24/2009,Middle of the road,3,"Overall an OK car. Took 3 kids and a bunch of camping gear 1100 miles over 10 days. Everyone did OK. My son, a newer driver, doesn't like to drive it - too twitchy. I drive it to go skiing and the 4WD/AWD is solid on icy roads with all-season tires - no studs needed. Road noise is too high. It sounds and feels cheaply made."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,starflare21, 01/22/2007,My '07 Mitsubishi Outlander XLS,3,"This vehicle's ""ups"" are the paddle shifters which make for fun spirited runs, aggressive styling cues both in and out, and a fairly decent engine. The ""downs"" are I personally do not like the choice of interior fabric. It is said to be better for stains, but in fact it attracts more lint and holds in stains/marks worse and takes much more effort to clean and to keep it that way. The 3rd row seat is useless and horribly uncomfortable. Other than the these things, I love that you can fold the rear seats for better room (though I wish they kept the power folding rear seats that's on the Japanese OEM model). Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase though it's a shame my local dealer is really rude and continues to be."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Justin Dover, 11/17/2006,Best Crossover Suv Every,5,"You will not find a better riding crossover SUV.  It has more features than any vehicle of it's type on the road.  It has the best navigation system built, the Lexus and the top end vehicles don't stand a chance."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,krafty81, 04/09/2009,Great little car!,4,"Bought this car used with 40K on it. Mileage a little higher than I wanted it but the car is in great condition. Dark blue, cream colored seats. Navi is very nice - I like it better than my Acura. Built in Sirius and music server - have already loaded 10 CD's. The car has great response and handles very well. Suspension is still because of that - you feel the bumps!  Love the keyless entry feature. Very pleased with the car overall - just a lot of fun to drive."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,20vcq, 02/07/2008,So so disappointed,3,Disappointment growing - lame awd - poor paint quality and road noise.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,leftbrain, 07/07/2011,Great little Crossover,5,"I bought this little 2007 Outlander just over a year ago - with just under 45K.
I've enjoyed driving it immensely - no problems whatsoever so far!
The only thing I dislike about it is the red dash lights - if I could change them to blue or green, I'd do that in a heartbeat.
Fortunately for me, though, I rarely drive at night, so it doesn't annoy me too often ;-)."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Bob, 05/17/2007,Nice car,4,Our recent trip of over 800 miles in our '07 Outlander was a pleasure.  We consistently got 28-29 mpg at highway speeds.  The manual shift option is fun and easy to use.  There is plenty of room in the rear for baggage.  how can you not love the exceptional 5 year bumper to bumper warranty?  We have downsized from ford Explorers and are seeing a big difference in economy.  I really like this car.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,exodeaux, 06/27/2008,Can't Get Enough!,5,"Simply put, I am happier with this vehicle than any I have ever owned. I highly recommend the Outlander LS. Quick, agile, roomy, and head turning. This baby is beautiful and sporty. I've shown it to three of my friends so far, and all three are headed to the dealer tomorrow to get one. I simply cannot say enough about this beautiful piece of engineering. So much for such a great price!! I have to keep going out to the parking lot just to make sure it's still there and I have to pinch myself when I remember it belongs to me. You will NOT be disappointed in this gorgeous, powerful, fun SUV. Get one today. It will honestly be the best purchase of your life. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Megan, 11/06/2008,Great Ride,4,"I had a 2004 Outlander and was going to trade it in on a used X5 until I drove the 2007 Outlander. I was very impressed on the improvements from 04 to 07. The engine, the interior and exterior design were all much much better. Glad they added the 6 cyl. engine and navigation system. The sound system quality is great. It was amazing how much more I got with the 07 for about the same price as I did the 04. It was definitely a good deal and I could not be happier with the vehicle. Mitsubishi worked great with me as well. I didn't have to make my last 2 payments on my 04 and they ""forgave"" me for going over on my milage, and even a little body damage where someone hit me in a parking lot."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Jo, 11/07/2008,Great Value,4,"I bought this car needing something with low miles, good gas mileage, but with more room (I am a horse person so I needed cargo space for my equipment).  I looked at all the usual crossovers (Escape, Rav4, CRV, etc) and found they were either too expensive, or did not get good enough gas mileage.  I found the Outlander, test drove 2, and fell in love with it.  I have never owned an automatic, so it took some getting used to, but I am happy with the pickup and passing ability on the highway.  Gas mileage is great- I've consistently been getting 27 mpg going 80 all the time on highway.  This car is a great value for the money- great options, safe, reliable, great gas mileage, and not boring!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,gamedad, 03/02/2009,Happy with it,4,"I've had this vehicle for slightly more than 2 yrs now. Had some minor issues when I first got it. The initial acceleration was a bit delayed but was fixed with a re-programming, about a 6-months wait. The side-view mirrors were rattling a bit and a cap beneath it was loose and fixed. The only thing not fixed is a delay when shifting from Reverse to Drive. There's always a couple of secs delay and will cause a lurch if the shifting is too fast. I've verified that this is not a problem on other vehicles. Other than these 3 minor stuff, it is a fun car to drive. Very responsive to acceleration after car is in motion."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,I. Macias, jr.,Love my 2007 Outlander!,4,"My 2007 XLS Outlander w/Sun and Sound Package, and the Luxury Package is still awesome and still very sexy looking. Recently put on 2,975 highway miles on trip to Las Vegas and San Diego, CA and my Outlander's V6 engine and 6-speed auto tranny handled it easily and very comfortably. Has many pluses and only a couple or real minuses... GREAT VEHICLE!!!  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,CErnst, 01/04/2010,Outlander is quality,4,"The Outlander has been a really solid SUV.  It hasn't really had any problems yet as it is relatively new.  The only quirk is a clunk from the ABS system when you start it and take off, but that's it.  Acceleration is REALLY good.  Braking is great.  Gas mileage is good, especially if you let cruise control do its thing.  It is sensitive to weight of the tire.  OEM tires, the computer said we were getting 27MPG doing 70MPH on Texas interstate.  Firestone Dueler tires get 23-ish, but they are heavier.  With new tires and traction control, this thing is a beast in the snow.  A very safe vehicle."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,M185, 08/16/2010,Great Value and Fun to Drive,4,"I purchased my 07 LS used with 44,500 miles.  It is the best value in a used compact SUV out there.  I shopped against Toyota RAV4 and Highlander, Acura MDX and RDX, Nissan Murano, and Ford Escape.  The Outlander with leather seating, V6 engine, AWD, rear seat DVD, and upgraded MP3 stereo was $3-10K less than the competition.  It is not the most luxurious, road noise is a little higher than the Acuras and Toyotas, and the suspension booms over some potholes but for the money, it can't be beat.  It blows away the 2003 Pathfinder we sold and I really liked the Nissan.  Highly recommended if you are shopping for the best value in a CUV.  My kids love it too."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Mylene, 10/24/2010,Very happy with my car,4,"I traded in my RAV4 with 200,000 miles for the Outlander. I had my doubts that I would be as happy with it or would get the reliability of the Toyota. I now love my Outlander. It rides way better than the RAV. The 6-cyl is real spiffy and I can actually pass cars now which I couldn't with the 4-cyl RAV. It handles great. I live in a mountain area and it takes the curves smooth. The gas mileage is real good. The cargo area is very roomy. I have not had to do anything other than maintenance on it. I am very happy with my Outlander."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,angela, 02/09/2008,Grandma loves her Outlander,4,"I love this SUV - have owned it for 15 months.  Shopped/researched many brands.  Almost bought a VUE or Equinox, then discovered this!  What value and so stylish!  I often take it to the mountains and  it performs beautifully, even in snowstorms!!  The gas mileage is fab - my best was 29.4 mpg.  I love the display and information panel.  Feel safe (both me and my grandkids in the back seat with air bags, especially the curtain and side air bags. Haul lots of stuff - the fold down rear seats and tail gate are great features.  "

The V6 is powerful and silky smooth, handling and breaks are tight , and the seats are very comfortable , just finished 900 mile trip. Car has the optional Rockford Fosgate stereo which is also very nice ..Oh and yes it gets great gas mileage and its loaded with safety features such as side air , front air , side curtain air stability control . In truth there is no comparing the underpowered poorly implemented 4 cylinder junk from buru , and hyundai , jeep has a weak v6 that guzzles gas .
 Would buy the Mitsu again .. "

This car has a number of great features and is very stylish inside and out. Drove a Honda CR-V and some others but this seemed like the best way to go.  Standard V6 blows away the competition and I also like the drive selector switch that lets you control 2WD, on demand AWD and full time AWD. I've been getting great gas mileage on mixed driving (I've even averaged over 27 mpg on my regular commute just the other day). Have felt some swaying with heavier winds which did surprise me. This SUV feels like a mid sized SUV in terms of interior space and with the V6 but gets the gas mileage of a compact."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Outclass, 08/11/2007,"Out Class, Out Run, Out Do, Out Price",5,"This is a great value compared to competitors in its class (Rav4, CR-V, Santa Fe).  It offers more standard and at better pricing than its competitors.  It's got more power standard compared to its competitors, and is roomy enough to fit 4 large adults. Exterior styling is excellent and doesn't look the part of a ""cute ute"".  I would recommend anyone looking into purchasing a mid to small SUV to look in to this vehicle if they want the most for their money."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,john e, 09/15/2007,Great SUV!!,5,"After looking at several brands we checked out the Outlander thanks to Edmunds information. We love it. It is sporty, great fuel economy, handles great and has a killer sound system (optional 650 watt). She was driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee w/a v8 and does not miss it. A Honda or Toyota this size will cost more and the Outlander is made in Japan!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Fish, 10/15/2007,Great value and best towing in class,4,I've had my LS 4wd for a month and I feel I made a good purchase.  The performance is only average.  It isn't nearly as fun to drive as the Mazda CX-7 that I test-drove.  But I think the Outlander is a much better overall value.  
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,SUVfan, 11/01/2007,The best SUV you've never heard of,5,"Bought the Outlander looking for a very safe, very well equipped family vehicle that still had the styling a young man would appreciate. This had it all. It has a great, fuel efficient 6 cylinder engine, a state of the art safety cage/ front and side airbags combination, responsive breaks, the best sound system I have ever heard (Rockford Fosgate upgrade is a no-brainer), soft, comfortable leather, and it rides like a dream. What a great discovery! "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,ddurham, 11/14/2007,Good Decision,4,"Great mpg if you drive conservatively which the info screen will help you achieve if that's your goal and at $3.33 a gal, it's becoming mine.  I noticed the throttle lag during a test drive but found a service bulletin on the forums and the dealer took care of reprogramming the ECM right away. The lag is no longer there."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Bob20vcq, 11/27/2007,Great Value,4,"4000 km drive to ""break it in"" showed that the road noise a little higher than we expected; the auto trans can be a little annoying, and it can scoot along with the best of them. The paddle shifter is a fun toy. In auto mode the damn thing is always trying to save gas with a very annoying rpm drop after every up shift. It drops off 500 rpm after the shift?! This is a truck and when I forget that and go romping into a corner at nine tenths it reminds me in in a controlled certain manner. But when dialed back to normal rate this is a very respectable handler well worth the money. Tried all the competitors and this is the best value. No regrets at all."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Seth, 03/28/2008,Fundamental flaws,3,"Vehicle has all the bells and whistles but does not have any useful features that don't cost much such as 1. Telescopic steering wheel or rather the lack of it. Cannot find a comfortable position even with arms stretched out and seat pulled forward, and I am of average size 5 10 with a small paunch. 2. Zero Cushion in leather seats for better distribution of pressure and back support. 3. Arm rest too low and useless. 4. No sound deadening materials. Noisy is the word. 5. Suspension makes for an extremely uncomfortable ride. Every undulation in the road is sent straight to driver's spine. 6. No door inserts or soft dash. Just a sea of hard thin black plastic."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,sfo_bayarea, 03/29/2008,great car but inferior interior,4,"Great engine, though inferior quality of interior features - easily scratched panels, no lights for button Windows except 1 -inferior seat cover - brakes are already squeaking at 7 mos old -prone to moisture, my front Windows have weird sound already- I am expecting them not to open anytime- informed dealers already - I am a Mitsubishi person though next time -I think I'll try Honda - my car was shipped from Japan- I noticed my tires are already worn out considering I just I take care of my car very well - I'll change my Yokohama tires in less than 2 years -maybe the u. S. Version is have longer mileage- who knows!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,mommytoo, 03/10/2010,Great Little SUV,4,"We found this while looking at the RAV- 4, but I knew nothing about it, so I looked up the rating-review. I went back to the dealership and test drove it, expecting it to be noisy and have a rough ride (consumer reports) - I was pleasantly surprised! It handles great, fun to drive, not that noisy (less than Honda)and a pleasant ride. It' a great all around CUV package  that met my needs better than CR-v, RAV-4,Santa Fe, or Murano. Yes, you can have a slightly smoother, quieter ride with a better interior quality in the Acura RDX/MDX or X35, for $20K more. You can have better audio in the Murano for $10K more. You can have great accel in RAV-4 for $10k more with few creature comforts.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,New Mitsu fan, 11/13/2006,Great Job Mitsubishi!,4,"I love the Outlander's peppy V6 engine. It has a quiet ride and is fun to drive. It also has a great suspension, not too firm, not too soft.  It comes with lots of features such as keyless ignition and Bluetooth that are not even available in other makes at this price. It is switchable between FWD, AWD and 4WD. Who else offers this at this price?  It has fantastic build quality. It's made in Japan with 100% Japanese parts content. After owning Toyota, Mazda, and Nissan products, I've got to say I'm impressed with the '07 Outlander. Mitsubishi really did well with the design of this product. I can see why this outsells the RAV4 in Japan. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,tim boyler, 05/01/2007,Before you buy that CR-V or RAV,5,"Despite its power, towing capacity, and sure-footed 4WD, this vehicle drives like a car. The ride feels solid, the features are great. I love the FastKey system, the stereo, and the abundance of cup holders. Seat warmer warms seat AND back. Paddle shifters for those who want more control. MP3 player jack too. The Outlander is really fun to drive, and the partial-zero emissions and great mileage make me feel environmentally responsible. I'm very happy with this purchase. You can get a 4WD, V6, superior stereo, sunroof, 3rd row seat (ok it's wimpy), leather, GPS navigation built-in with 30GB hard drive (10GB of which can store MP3s) for well under 30k. You can't beat that. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Poor man's car, 05/14/2007,Back to the drawing board,4,"Well where do I start, engine and trans are good, radio excellent, seats are are comfy but the material is awful. Like the drop down tailgate. Had the protection package put on to spruce it up otherwise it looked too plain."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,hramos, 11/27/2007,Excellent choice,4,"I did a good amount of research before deciding on the Outlander. The three crossover SUVs that were in the running was the Honda CRV, Toyota Rav4 and the Mitsubishi Outlander. The Outlander has a smooth ride and is quick! It can pick up speed on the highway fast and before you know it you are hitting 80 or 90 but its so smooth you wont notice it. Cool looking inside and out. Great car for the money."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,dipesh roka, 06/17/2008,Great car,5,"I have xls 07 outlander and am very satisfied with this truck. I used to have used car.  Every time I had to go long drive I would worry about that car. Now I have this car and have no fear to long drives. I been many places using this outlander, it's great car in my opinion this SUV is much more better than Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,sunshyndrmr, 06/17/2008,Great Vehicle,4,"What a fantastic car!  I had seen the Outlander but thought it was out of my price range and moved on.  After test driving the Scion Xb which I originally planned to buy, I was less impressed than I thought I would be.  I wanted something or more quality not just fun.  This is both!  I got lucky, they had 2 '07's on the lot that they were trying to get rid of, and I ended up with more options that I could've ever afforded"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,mchrist152, 12/15/2007,AWD system rocks!!,4,"I've been most impressed with the AWD system on this vehicle.  It has an electronically controlled clutch that engages and disengages based on inputs like wheel speed, steering wheel position, throttle level, etc.  Unlike other vehicles that rely on a viscous coupling, the front wheels don't need to slip before the rear wheels receive power.  This vehicle drives all four wheels from a standing start.  The end result is that this vehicle holds the road in winter conditions like no other vehicle I've ever driven.  It feels solid - like a Swiss watch - and looks good too.  On the down side, it is not as powerful as the RAV4 nor does it get as good of mileage (about 2mpg and 49HP less)."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,jnwafor, 09/09/2008,Pleasantly Surprised!,4,"Originally I was looking to purchase a Mazda CX-7; however, after doing a test drive and seeing its low fuel economy I was not impressed. Then I set my eyes on the Outlander. This car is dependable, GREAT fuel economy, I can get up to 30 mpg highway when traveling to work. (Can't get anywhere close to that with a Mazda). It has decent pick up with its standard V6 220 horsepower engine, I can definitely pass with no problem and keep up with fast lane traffic."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,jhill99357, 09/06/2008,Somewhat overrated,3,"After an extensive test drive and looking at the available competition, I thought that this was overrated.  I saw the great reviews by everyone and thought that it was going to be a home run.  Since the Outlander is based off of the Lancer, it definitely drives more like a sports car.  The ride is very firm and you have a tenancy to feel every bump in the road.   The interior left a lot to be desired compared to the Santa Fe and CR-V.  The plastic door panels looked cheap and the arm rest was made of hard to clean cloth.   The car itself is basically a clone of the RAV 4 in how it looks and drives. If you like that car, you'll love the Outlander.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,lady b, 12/25/2007,Love it.,4,"I love my new vehicle I cannnot get enough compliments. MPG was not as great as I hoped, usually around 24 on highway. It is much better than the 15 or so I got with my jeep cherokee.  The one draw back, although I like the 30 gb music  storage, I still wish I had an outlet for my zune/mp3 player and the system doesn't seem to have cd name and title for some of my most recent cd purchases. Otherwise I cannot complain. I am happy with this purchase. I am not sorry I passed on the toyota and honda so far anyway. I've had it for about 6 months now. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Love it, 11/15/2008,Love the Outlander - so fun,4,"I've been driving the Outlander for a year now.  Bought it brand new.  My favorites are the torque (very quick), fun to drive, turning radius, love the liftgate (perfect for changing babies diapers), backseats lay down easily, the upgraded bluetooth is nice, all the cupholders are handy, great setup in the front seat, and the long warranty are just some of my positives.  My husband likes the head space, yet it is small for tight garage. My only complaint is the seats are very sporty & not as soft and comfy as I would like.  After about 6 mo, I had a problem with the circuit breaker (I may have blew something out) and the dealership replaced everything free & immediately with no questions asked"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Gloria LaBrecque, 01/02/2009,Terrific Buy - I Love this Car!,5,"I bought this vehicle after 6 months of researching several similar small SUVs, like the Rav 4, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Forester, etc. I found the ride of the Mitsubishi very comfortable, the look very sporty and sleek and the overall driving experience to be superior to the others and the BEST part of this research process was the price piece - the ""Bishi"" (as my 3 year old calls her) was less than the whole bunch.  I have owned the car for two full months and have consistently gotten 20-21 mpg city driving and 26-27 mpg on the highway."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Duane, 01/03/2009,So So After 2 Years,4,"Overall, I still like this vehicle better than competing vehicles.  However, I do have a few issues.  First, the tires are horrible in snow and there are few choices available for XLS type rims.  Second, already have several squeaks and rattles. Third, exterior paint scratches easily and body panels dent easily."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Duane, 01/10/2009,Squeaky Outlander,3,I must inform potential buyers that this vehicle has major squeaks and rattles.  Mine is getting so bad that I'm considering selling.  I can't even enjoy the stereo since the whole interior is rattling and making all kinds of crazy back ground noises when I turn up the volume.  Also have multiple rattles when going over the slightest cracks in road.  Very disappointed with my 07 Outlander.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Moose, 02/03/2009,Great Auto,4,I had this auto 1 1/2 years and have had no problems. The looks are great for the inside and outside. Really stands out when clean. I find the comfort in the front seats very good. Gas mileage is about 25 - 26 highway.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,robxls, 03/30/2009,Love it,4,Well for the price it has all the features I wanted in a car. I have had it for about 2 years. Some of the parts are falling off like the plastic clips holding the back of the 3rd row seat and the driver side mirror shakes sometimes but the drive is great.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Jamie, 05/25/2009,Paint chips and plastic,4,"I was a happy owner of the 04 outlander and fell in love with the look of the 07. Got a good deal on a sun and sound package demo... I thought, until I noticed the paint chipping and rust on the bottom of the back doors.  Went rounds with mitsu only to find that since this is exterior damage that occurred after the vehicle left the lot, it is considered wear and tear.  I figured the person driving the demo was abusive, but have learned this is a common problem with the design.  This chipping paint is going to look terrible in a year or so.  The finishes on the 07 are of a much lower quality than the 04 I previously owned, which has left me with a negative impression of Mitsubishi.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,egiardie, 01/07/2008,Love technology? You'll love this car!,4,"Absolutely the best bang for the buck out there!  I purchased a 2007 XLS, with the three upgrade packages (luxury, sun/sound, and nav packages) during Christmas week (got a great end of year deal - payed only $28k!) and I couldn't be happier with this car.  The engineering, attention to detail, and high tech appeal is just unbeatable for the price - not to mention the 5 year/60k mile warranty!  Beats the competition hands down!  Do the research, take a test drive, and you'll probably end up buying this car - I did! "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,biscuit_xls, 01/26/2008,Very Fun CUV,4,"I've had my Outlander XLS V6 4WD for almost a year and 11,000 miles. So far it's been a really good vehicle. Fun to drive, handles good, decent fuel economy (20mpg+), and lots of great features.  I cross-shopped all CUVs, it came down to the Outlander vs. RAV4 V6. The Outlander won because of better styling and a lot of useful features. I think I like the Outlander even more after driving it for a year!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,mr. e, 01/25/2008,best suv out for the money,5,"I had 05/4cyl now I have 07/6cly.. better gas mileage, more room and great drive, good pick up and smooth shifting with the 6 speed auto transmission. love the tailgate when putting in the golf clubs, help so you bang or damage the back bumper..."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,MitsuLover, 01/28/2008,Great Competitor,4,"I've had my XLS eleven months now and am very happy with it; no problems yet & going strong.  It has a number of features usually found in much more expensive cars, but if Mitsubishi wants the XLS to compete against the higher-end SUVs in its segment, then they'll have to ""up the ante""; they'll have to install illuminated vanity mirrors (and improve quality of sun visors), programmable automatic locks, dual express-down windows, real fog lamps, mudguards, driver and passenger power seats, auto-dimming mirror w/built-in compass and HomeLink.  With at least these additional features, it would put the Outlander XLS more at the Acura/BMW/Lexus level as opposed to the Honda/Toyota level."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,jimbo52, 01/27/2008,Great value and great performance!,4,We have been looking for a compact crossover with occasional third row seats.  The XLS provided more than expected features and performance at a reasonable price.  No problems and a great warranty.   Anyone looking at vehicles in this class should try this one last.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,mikgyver, 07/31/2009,Outstanding Outlander,5,"I spend every free moment researching and driving cars, and then recommending them to others. After 24 used cars, the first to make me jump into a new car was Mitsu's 'Outty'.  Rock-solid reviews everywhere peaked my interest. The unique fold down tailgate got me to the dealership. The absurd amount of cool features for the same cost as a base CRV or RAV brought it home.  Obviously, the exterior looks darn good. Despite other reviews knocking the interior, my wife and I (both designers) love the it, and respect Mitsu for not putty phaux grain on plastic.  My Infinity FX35 driving boss had to borrow the Outty one day. 'That car is cool! You have a touch screen. I don't even have that."""
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,USMC VET, 05/05/2010,Nice Crossover,4,This Crossover is great.  No major problems.  I bought it used and it was in great condition.  Handles well with great pick up on the Highway.  The City MPG is bad but on the highway it is great.  I am currently thinking about buying one for myself.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Cuffy, 02/07/2008,Don't Overlook This One.,5,"Overall this is a top notch design by Mitsubishi.  As a complete package it outshines all other competitors in the segment and for a price far less than expected.  Performance, power, style, handling, comfort, convenience, technology, fuel economy and fun all wrapped up in a sharp looking CUV with big room on a small budget.  Nice fit/finish for this segment - tight seams and clean lines all around.  Interior plastics are on par with other manufacturers, but could be slightly softer.  The 6-speed is responsive and great for mileage, but can hunt for the right gear on long inclines.  Reliability shouldn't be an issue, especially with the outstanding warranty."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Cuffy, 02/13/2008,All-Around Performer,5,"Had the Outtie for a month now and like it more everyday.  Fun to drive, looks great, handles nicely, fits our needs well, is extremely comfortable for 3-4 hr trips, and consistently gets 20-22 mpg in mixed 4WD auto mode driving. What more could you ask for in a CUV?  Selectable 4WD, heated leather seats, moonroof, hard-disk 650 watt music server and navi system, auto-leveling HID headlights, v6 w/paddle shifting 6-speed semi-auto, roof rails, 3rd row jump seat, fold down tailgate, Bluetooth, more safety features than most luxury cars, and 18"" wheels.  Let's see any other manufacturer do that for under $30K."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,wen, 12/17/2006,Great Buy,5,"I purchased this car not to long ago and so far it has an awesome feel, an awesome drive, is very roomy, and is comfortable.  I knew after seeing it online I had to go and test drive it since then I have been in love."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,LuvMyOutlander, 12/23/2006,Mitsubishi has raised the bar,4,"When I started shopping for a new car this fall, I never in a million years thought I would buy a Mitsubishi SUV. BUT... I did and I love it.  Mitsubishi has raised the bar!  This vehicle blows away anything else under $30,000.  I wanted an Acura RDX, but couldn't swing the price.  This truck gives me most of the features, almost the same performance and size at $10,000 less.  I first read about about the new Outlander in InsideLine.  I waited for a dealer to get one and then drove it.  I loved it!  I loved the features, the looks, the interior, everything! For a die-hard Honda/Acura guy like myself, the fact that I bought one, should tell you just how good it is."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Arnold, 12/29/2006,Great Value for Your Money!,4,"I just bought my Outlander last month and I'm very satisfied with it.  I test drove the RAV4 before buying the Outlander, and my wife and I felt dizzy after.  It was not a smooth ride unlike the Outlander.  I got all the options and the navigation is very helpful and accurate.  The sound system is great.  The hard drive in the sound system is wonderful as I store all my music in it.  The vehicle handles itself well, even at high speeds on the freeway.  Its cargo room is impressive.  The fast key feature is wonderful and very helpful.  Add to that the 5-year standard warranty and the 10-year powertrain warranty, and there's no other deal that can beat that at it's price (for under $30,000)!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,evorg, 01/12/2007,There was no doubt which was the best!,4,"I tried all the SUIVs - Honda, Mazda, The Toyota RAV4, Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tuscon, and the Saturn VUE.  The Outlander blew them out of the water!  It is the best buy with the best options and best warranty."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Lantgeo, 02/01/2007,Great value for the money,4,"I traded my 2003 Infiniti FX45 for an Outlander. I needed a more practical vehicle. The good: I paid $25,000 for a demo model with leather, a sweet stereo, and navigation. It drives like a car, handles OK for an SUV, I love the paddle shifters, the 3rd row comes in handy for kids and short trips, and the fold down tailgate is a great idea. The Bad: It has pronounced wind noise from the driver's side window, it has initial acceleration hesitation, the fog lights cannot be used with hid's, and the doors have to be slammed to shut. These are all minor issues. This is a good vehicle overall."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Mickey, 01/31/2007,It's New and It's Fun!,5,"I just bought this vehicle a couple of days ago and I am very impressed so far by its quality and the fun to drive factor, while getting great gas mileage."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,hansp1, 01/26/2007,Great SUV,4,I've had this SUV for two weeks and can't say enough good things about it! There is a lot of bang for the buck here!   What you get for your dollar is not to be believed!  I had a Subaru Outlander that I loved and was quite honestly looking at a new one when I decided to check this car out.  It was really no contest!
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,jedidude75, 02/11/2007,Great Mid-size SUV,5,"We recently purchased a 2007 Outlander with everything, navigation, the Rockford Fosgate speakers, Bluetooth, 4 wheel drive, XLS and sunroof. The vehicle is a steal for its price!  The navigation needs some map upgrades, but overall this SUV is excellent!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,outout, 02/02/2007,Unsatisfied,3,"My '07 Outlander has excessive wind-noise...the worst I have seen in any vehicle. The wind noise just gushes inside the cabin.  I just keep wondering how Mitsubishi spoiled an otherwise great vehicle with nice value and features, because they did not take care of small things like proper cabin insulation."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Bob, 02/03/2007,'07 Outlander LS Praise,4,"My '07 Outlander LS has less than 1,000 miles, but it has already delighted me with its good gas mileage. I recently got 28.6 mpg on a 150 mile trip and for a while was actually averaging over 29. The vehicle is spunky when it needs to be.  Its controls are well placed and easily accessible.  The dash is easy to read.  The 6-speed tranny is great, and gives you freedom to shift easily into a higher or lower gear.  For example, down shifting for engine braking.  This is a comfortable car for even a 6 footer like me and how can you beat the 10 year/100K mi. warranty?  Weak spots in design?  Maybe it's a bit difficult to see behind yourself, but no more so than in most SUVs.  This is a very good buy for the buck."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Jennifer, 02/05/2007,Love My Outlander!,5,"Let me start off by saying I wanted the Nissan Murano or the Mazda CX-7, but my husband wanted me to look at the Outlander just to see what it offered. I was so impressed with the standard features and price on the Outlander that we walked away with a fully loaded one at just over $30,000. This is something that CAN NOT be done with the Murano or CX-7. There are so many features on this vehicle that I am still trying to figure them out. You must go see it for yourself to fully appreciate it. The 3rd row seats are small but I knew this when I bought it. My kids (ages 10 and 12) don't mind sitting back there on short trips. I keep the seat folded down for space but it's nice to have it when needed."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,TXHillCoutryFamily, 02/13/2007,Make Some Heads Turn...,5,"This is a fun ride.  It's not to big, not to small, and really eye catching. Nope it's not a RAV4, not a Lexus, guess again...it has a clean design inside and out, with great handling and zip.  My wife and I fight to drive it. The Outlander has great overall features for the price. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Happy owner, 02/16/2007,I Love It,5,"I wanted a small crossover SUV. My requirements were: engine on the stronger side, full safety equipment, including side airbags and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). Research this online, this is of utmost importance and will be mandatory starting in 2012. The RAV4 engine is a bit stronger but cost more and you get fewer features. I didn't like anything about the CR-V, not to mention the looks and the small engine. The Mazda CX-7 costs more and looks too much like a minivan. If it was only looks I'd take the Xterra, but it has the finesse of a truck (it's not a crossover). Jeep and the other American small SUVs that I looked at didn't have ESC. The Outlander has more than any other vehicle I looked at."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,John, 02/20/2007,Right Size and Great Value,4,"We compared cross-over SUVs and the Outlander was clearly the best value.  Our first requirement was front wheel drive or 90/10 AWD (which eliminated the Nissan Xterra and others).  Our second requirement was no premium fuel (which eliminated the new Mazdas, the Nissan Murrano, and most turbos).  Our third requirement was 6-cylinders, which eliminated the Honda CR-V.  That only left the Outlander, Toyota RAV4 and Hundai Sante Fe as options.  The RAV4 was too small and the spare tire on the hatch is annoying.  The interior of the Sante Fe was cheap/ugly.  The Outlander outclassed the competition, especially with the 100,000 mile/10 year warranty.  I am still very happy after a month of driving."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,LD810, 02/28/2007,Sharp SUV!,4,"I just leased an Outlander XLS five days ago, and so far I'm very impressed!  I got it with the Luxury Package and the Sun-and-Sound Package.  The ride is excellent and so are its cornering and handling in general.  The V6 engine is smooth and provides plenty of power.  The exterior and interior have great fit and finish, and interior materials look nice and of good quality.  It has plenty of storage space and it's full of great features.  It is very roomy and comfortable.  It has great bucket seats!  The 3rd-row seats are tiny, but I have no need for them, so it's not an issue. Overall, there's not much competition out there for the quality and price.  I think it's the leader in its class."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Michael Kroll, 03/12/2007,Vader,5,"I had wanted to replace my 2001 F150 Supercrew with a new Mustang, but that was not practical with one offspring still in collage.  The Outlander seemed to be the best bet for our needs.  So far this vehicle has surpassed all of my expectations!  I have hauled quite a few boxes (my mother is in the process of moving) and have torn up the roads using the F1 style paddle shifters.  They took a bit of getting familiar with, since I am used to manual gearboxes such as in my wife's mustang GT, but once I did, there is no way that I will use the full on auto, unless the wife is with me. (She likes good gas mileage).  Also, the Rockford/Fosgate kicks!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Linda S, 03/05/2007,Best Compact Available,4,"We test drove most CUVs and once in the Outlander XLS, there was no turning back.  Our second choice was the RAV4, but it didn't have the nice features and the swing tailgate/tire would be annoying when launching our boat.  The Outlander will be great with the lift gate and tail gate. The Navigation system is impressive and in winters, the Active Skid Control and 4WD are a must for ND winters. The warranty is top notch."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Mitsu convert, 03/05/2007,Near luxury at a Fantastic Price,4,"I did lots of research before buying my Outlander.  In a nutshell, I found that for about $10,000-$15,000 more you could get a luxury SUV with SLIGHTLY better performance, SLIGHTLY better handling, a SLIGHTLY better interior (if you like the fake wood look), and similar technology and safety features.  I figured I'd keep the 50% premium and get a great small SUV with beautiful styling (like a Lexus RX 300 with a boxier rear), great tech features (NAV, Bluetooth, phenomenal stereo w/Music Server!), a clean, simple dash and interior, all the handling/power/safety features I required, and the space and features I wanted (3rd row, lots of storage).  The '07 Outlander is a fantastic vehicle, I highly recommend it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,pitt4, 02/29/2008,07 Outlander,5,"Have only had the car for a week now but am extremely happy I made the decision to buy this vehicle.  Reliability is yet TBD, but I'm confident this one's a keeper."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Love It, 03/21/2007,Great Vehicle for the Price,5,"We have had our Outlander about three months now and love it.  My husband comes home with a smile on his face after driving around in his Outlander all day.  We looked at the RAV4 - too expensive with the V6, the CR-V - didn't have enough power, and the Jeep Compass - just not what we were looking for."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Michael Boyer, 04/01/2007,Best small suv,5,"I test drove and researched most of the new small and mid-sized SUVs available: Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav-4, Mazda CX-7, Acura RDX, Suzuki Grand Vitara, and the just released Land Rover LR2. I was really pumped about the LR2, but came away disappointed, with an SUV like drive, cramped second row seats, and small trunk. The CX-7 was the most fun to drive, but the Outlander is not far behind. It has a nicely revving engine and the manual shifting is very smooth. The Outlander simply was the best fit in terms of driving comfort and response, utility, and value. I passed on the nav  but got the sun/sound and luxury. I have only driven 300 miles or so, but am very pleased so far."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Amelia, 04/10/2007,A Great Competitor!,4,"I've had my XLS about a month and a half now, and I love it.  It's fun to drive and runs very nicely.  Compared to others in the same car segment, this one is the clear winner as far as I'm concerned.  Toyota and Honda don't offer as much at this price level, and to boot, I think the Outlander is a good-looking car, especially with the 18"" wheels and LED tail lights which are normally found in higher-priced vehicles.  Mitsubishi's attempt to include a 3rd-row seat is the only big minus I find with this car. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,MitsuFanCanada, 04/09/2007,Love my new 07 Outlander,5,"The 2007 Outlander providers the right balance between price and performance. Just had our first ""road trip"" GTA East out to Niagara Falls. Handled well, great travelling through the traffic on the 400 series highways and the fuel economy wasn't bad. I think I'll enjoy driving this SUV for a long time."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Archquark, 04/17/2007,Great Vehicle,4,"I just retired in March 07, 2007 and the wife and I wanted a vehicle for trips to Nova Scotia from our home in Ontario. We looked into several other SUVs but we both liked the Outlander right away. It has a lot things that appeal to us. Comfortable seats, ability to switch to manual control (we both drive manuals, mine 2001 Jetta TDI and her a 2004 Saturn Ion Quad Coupe) 4 wheel disc ABS with EBD, active skid control, great sound system etc. Just wish they had made third seat an option and left more room for storage for all us boomers whose children are in their 20s and 30s."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Alltone, 05/06/2007,One Punishing Ride,4,"A kidney belt might be a nice option, you will feel every crack and bump in that supposedly smooth black top. The ride is harsh and tiring, like a bicycle with touring wheels, otherwise the car is a joy.  We got the basic $20k model, upgraded to leather, moon roof, CD changer, 10 yr warrantly."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,JayWa, 04/21/2007,Best Kept Secret,4,"My Outlander marks the end of a long search to replace my 1995 Aurora. It stomps the Toyota Rav4 and Honda CR-V on looks, warranty and practicality; it is more driveable and gets better mileage than the Dodge Dakota; and it has more usable storage than the Dodge Magnum with much better visibility. Performance is not what I enjoyed with the Aurora's V-8, but the Outlander has acceptable zip (on regular gas) and gets better mileage - almost 22 mpg on my daily in-town/Interstate commute. The 650-watt stereo and 10-inch subwoofer are fun to show off, but if you aren't into rap then I would suggest you stick with the standard system and use the extra $$ to take this on a vacation. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,ARS, 04/27/2007,Great Value,4,"I like this vehicle more and more each day.  It drives nice and has a lot a cool features.  I find the engine a little soft on immediate acceleration, but find it very responsive afterwards.  The third road seat is not that useable and I would like to have that as an option to get the extra storage.  The clamshell rear opening is very versatile.  I found you can lower the tailgate and close the top hatch to haul longer items like boards.  I feel like I am driving a high class vehicle but not paying the high price.  It is a real value!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Pete, 04/26/2007,Excellent Value,4,I've had my Outlander for 3 weeks and so far I am very happy.  I have the luxury and s&s packages.  The ride is a good balance between sport and comfort.  I like the exterior and interior look.  It has tons of features for the money and is very versatile.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,ivan, 05/01/2007,Good Mom Mobile,5,"For the price it's great. My suggestion is to splurge and get the XLS with all the options. You will wish you had if you don't. Great mom car, better and much more style then a mini van. Handles well and has a safe feel."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Brett, 05/23/2007,"Great performance, great value",4,Have been driving my 2007 Outlander ES for a while now.  Styling is exactly what I'd always liked and build quality seems solid so far. Interior appointments are excellent even on my base model. A real pleasant surprise is all Outlanders come with car alarm standard (good for saving on insurance). Long warranty is generous and transferable to 2nd owner. Performance is the best part and what makes this SUV stands out from other compact to midsized SUVs. It's got enough zoom and zip to make driving fun. Great compact SUV!
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Great SUV, 06/27/2007,Much Better than RAV4 and CRV,5,The XLS with all the options easily surpasses both the Honda CRV and Toyota's RAV4. It comes with features one only gets on much more expensive vehicles. It's exceptional value for money and looks great. I spent weeks researching small SUVs and am very happy with my purchase. This car is really a diamond in the rough.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,jack, 07/13/2007,Very Satisfied,4,"I've received nothing but compliments about exterior and interior. It's perfect for me and my daughter. Would rather it had a little more power but it's more than sufficient.  Handling is great, and gas mileage around town is just about 20, not bad for an suv. Have not used the flip up seats, but have comfortably sat 5.  Rear seat belts are difficult to latch for an adult (narrow positioning). So far I love this vehicle. Mine was loaded with everything but a rear dvd player, all the toys are well worth it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,tonio, 07/21/2007,"Fast, fun and good looking",5,"Great small SUV, very quick and agile, fun to drive, quiet and fast. Great on gas and warranty."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,07XLSDiamond, 09/02/2007,2007 Mitsubishi Outlander,4,"This car had nearly everything I wanted in a small to midsize SUV.  I use it as my daily driver.  I got the Diamond White Pearl XLS FWD model with all the bells and whistles except the DVD package.  I got the navigation package with 40G hard drive, sunroof, leather, bluetooth, SIRIUS radio (I'd have prefered XM), etc.  The gas mileage is okay, around 21.6 average.  Mitsubishi owners are also a great bunch of people, this is my second Mitsubishi; I own an Eclipse too."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,klas, 09/13/2007,Best bang for your buck!,5,"I've compared them all, (RAV4, CR-V, Santa Fe, CX-7, etc.) and as soon as I test drove Outlander I fell in love. It's not just the styling, but everything else you get for the price. Go and price it!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,JPA1, 10/04/2007,Never thought of Mitsubishi,5,Thanks to Edmunds I added the Outlander to my list of SUVs. Also looked at the CR-V and the RAV4. I got it with the upgraded sound and navigation system. If you can swing them they are worth it.  Being 60+ my wife and I like not having hop up or crouch down to get in. All and all a good vehicle for the buck. Thanks Edmunds.
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,theddy, 05/19/2007,Everything you want,5,"The best looks on the outside. Inside is roomy and comfortable. I have the luxury package, sun & sound, and the accessory navigation package that I can't live w/out. Hard drive based nav is fast and the music server that expels the iPod is cool. It has a powerful v6 engine that outruns those four cylinders. but still very fun to drive. It has the best features in its class. Some standard features are additional costs to the competition. The split open tailgate liftgate is very clever idea that adds the best convenience in cargo handling, unlike those that open sideways with bulky doors with tires on it which blocks your way. The best bang for the buck, best SUV on the track."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,J, 05/24/2007,Buy this,5,"Ok, I'll make this short because I could go on forever. About a year ago I ordered a brand new 2007 BMW X3, it came with all the options I wanted, and boy did it go fast in a straight line. It didn't do much else, and I returned it and its $50k pricetag this March (after putting 5k miles on it).  Yes I took a loss, and yes you can laugh, but the bottom line is that I realized you can spend a ton less and still get great cars.  The point of telling you that is that I absolutely love my new Outlander that is $20k less than the BMW.  This time, I researched/testdrove/etc. every other small SUV out there and the Outlander beat them all."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Jerry, 05/23/2007,The Outlander made me a believer in Mitsu,5,"The Mitsubishi Outlander won me over with its great power, smooth acting 6 speed auto transmission, high technology car with GPS, blue tooth, fast key, satellite radio, high output audio, xenon headlights, MP3/6 CD changer, ABS, EBD, ASC systems, MIVEC, TPMS, HDD navigational system and DVD/CD player.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,hgarmarr, 05/31/2007,Amazing New Redesigned Outlander,5,"Excellent driving performance, good road handling. Stylish looks and very comfortable interiors.  Very useful features."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,SRR MAUI, 06/16/2007,Love it,4,"I have owned Toyota and Honda for the last 30 years and have no complaints. I test drove and researched the Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4 thoroughly before reaching the conclusion the Outlander far exceeds these two in quality, ride comfort, and value. The Outlander has great style, a 6 speed transmission that is smooth and perfectly balanced. It is quiet inside and has a fantastic Rockford Fosgate stereo and bluetooth."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Mother of Twins, 07/08/2007,Outlander 2007,4,"It's fun to drive. Handles very well in curves, even in really sharp curves. It accelerates quick and it is fast for a small SUV.  It has a lot of cup holders. It has more than one storage compartment, not only the regular glove box.  The seat hugs so you can't slide when turning. It is a fun SUV to drive and cool looking.   "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,marcjho, 09/12/2007,Out Everything ;),4,"I'm very happy with my purchase, and for the price paid it stands alone.  I'm a tall person (6'5) and I have plenty of room to spare.  It's a very smooth and comfortable ride.  I took it on a 3 hour road trip over labor day weekend and it's pleasure to drive, especially with the upgraded stereo system. :)"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Johnny Appleseed, 09/14/2007,2007 Mitsubishi Outlander,3,"The V6 engine is strong, but hard acceleration off the line results in heavy torque steer coupled with tires (Yokohama) that do not provide enough traction for the amount of power this vehicle delivers. Ride is silky smooth, but a bit loud by today's standards. Steering column controls are good as well as climate controls, but radio controls are too small. As deeply inset as the speedometer and odometer are, they still have glare when sunny. Seating is comfortable, but cloth is thin and feels cheap. The 2nd row seatbacks are a bit low for adults, but they recline and move fore and aft for added comfort. Front and rear armrests are too short even for average size adults."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,outlander driver, 09/25/2007,Sporty and Fun,4,"I've had my LS 2WD Outlander for one month now and love it so far.  It is getting great gas mileage, about 24 in the city, and it is so fun to drive.  Has all the necessary features plus some extras.  I did my research and test drove the CRV and RAV4 and didn't think they had near as much power.  They weren't as fun to drive either.  For the money, the Outlander is the way to go.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Dr. Ann, 06/05/2007,My first car is a total winner,4,"This is my very first car! Since I got it in January, I've been very, very, very happy with it. Every aspect is just right. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I just started working, but just needed a car to move my kid to school and places. Our Britax convertible car seat fits perfectly, and when I tell my friends this new Outlander has the latest-tech rigid anti-crash frame (called R.I.S.E.) as well as six advanced-tech airbags, plus 5-star frontal crash test result from the NHTSA, they are impressed. Great value!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,qqt414, 07/13/2007,Blk 07 Outlander (my perfect fit!),4,"After doing much research on the CR-V, RAV4, and other small SUVs, I finally chose the 07 Outlander and after a few thousand miles of driving I feel I definitely made the right choice. Love the sporty exterior and interior styling as well as features such as the Rockford system (best system in the class by far) and the great fold down tailgate design that I have used a lot. Also you get the best leather in the class plus all the tech gadgets that make me happy.  Sporty handling, well weighted steering, and a joy to drive. Decent fuel economy compared with RAV4 and CR-V, but the benefits definitely outweigh! Test drive it and you will be surprised!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Sunnyvale, 07/10/2007,Surprise winner,4,"We were looking for a green car with if possible style and performance.  Test drove the CRV, Pilot, Highlander and a hybrid Escape.  None came close to the Outlander in style and performance. In CA the engine is rated PZEM and is the cleanest non-hybrid SUV out there, I think. The big surprise was that we can fit both our road bikes in the back upright! None of the others could do this.  And the mini tailgate is very convenient. A solid, nice handling, luxurious little/big SUV."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,franchinboy, 07/11/2007,I dig it,5,"I've had this car for about 3 months now and I love it! Definitely not a mom SUV. I'm a 29 yr old male who has previously owned a Mazda RX-8 and Audi TT. Great transition vehicle for me. All the upgrades are worth it, wouldn't have gotten it without them. This car is very fun to drive too. I've never noticed any road or wind noise. The 3rd row seat is small, but my wife rode back there once, she is 5'7, and said it wasn't bad. Just couldn't do for a long road trip. Front seats are very comfortable, back seats a little more stiff. Fuel economy is great IMO, a lot better than my previous Mazda. All around, a very cool ride."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,RonK, 07/30/2007,Excellent driver accessibility,4,"First impression after 650 miles is that vehicle is built like a swiss watch, very precise. Compared to 4 other SUVs and features/price could not be beat. Very impressed with warranties/roadside assistance offerings. Speaks to manufacturer confidence in vehicle. However, having said all this, vehicle does have peculiarities, which I cover in suggested improvements. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,jeremydb2112, 10/04/2007,"My ""Winter Car""",5,"After being sick of struggling around in a rear wheel drive sports car in the snow I decided it was time to purchase a winter car and something with some room to transport items.  I debated just about every small SUV and drove quite a few.  I wasnt even looking at the Outlander until a good friend (Mitsu owner) told me I should give it a try.  The dealer let me borrow it for the afternoon and that is all it took.  The car drives great, rides as well as a family member's Lexus RX 300.  The MMCS (Mitsubishi Multi Communications System) is awesome and has just about every feature available.  I rarely drive the sports car now as this is a better ride and still great fun to drive!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,goldenboy, 10/28/2007,One Solid SUV,4,"I got the car late ma 2007 and I must say I'm very satisfied with the car's performance. The cabin & cargo area is very spacious. The interior geometry & functionality is superb, you'll have no problems finding extra space to store stuff. Despite its high stance, it rides and drives like a car w/very good handling and a comparably comfortable ride. Put it on 4WD lock & you'll be surprised how well it handles twisty roads at moderately high speeds. Power-wise, you may not take off like a rocket but there's a lot of it to pass and climb steep terrain. Overall, this is a great car. It certainly deserves more credit than what most other reviews give it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Flerurp, 03/06/2008,Love - Hate,3,"Noisy at times, front suspension geometry is lacking - watch those corners at speed! "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Russ, 11/25/2007,Outstanding Outlander,4,"One year of ownership.  Love the car, not perfect, but love it nontheless.  Very responsive, comfortable, and fun to drive. Lots of room and storage space.  Torque steer can be pronounced, but have learned to deal with it.  Have averaged just what the EPA says on fuel mileage.  Would buy again."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Gunther, 03/11/2008,Outlander XLS AWD - Best buy for the $$$,4,"Have owned the vehicle for less than 3 months and already have 5000 trouble free miles on it. Love the ride and handling and also the paddle shifters come in handy in really bad weather. You can select your gears without taking your hands off the wheel. Had a vibration at highway speeds due to a defective Goodyear tire, which was replaced under warranty by the dealership."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Eddie, 03/13/2008,Love it,4,"Great SUV and a lot of bang for the buck. Performance and gas mileage are great, stereo system rocks! Clean lines and styling. Only knock I give it is relatively high cabin noise at freeway speeds."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Twinmom143, 03/18/2008,2007 Mitsubishi Outlander XLS,5,"I haven't had my Outlander for long, but what an upgrade to the Mommy-van!  I was looking for a vehicle that is sporty when I don't have the kids, but one that would allow me to still pick up all three kids (and a friend if necessary).  Kids love the tv/dvd, great sound system, hard drive, navigation, handsfree phone, sunroof.  LOVE IT!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,anthony, 03/19/2008,My outlander,4,"Everything about this car is amazing. One being the exterior and interior design, my Outlander had the 18 inch rims which looked great with the labor black paint job. The car is so fun to drive. I even got this monster up to 125 mph with friend. The average gas mileage for me was about 24 mpg on the highway. I also have a 2003 highlander and it's no match, this outlander is just amazing."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,GREAT SUV, 04/01/2008,Awesome Suv,4,"Went in to actually buy a kia sportage and test drove the 2007 outlander 4 door 4wd and loved it, best decision I could of made. Reliable, fun to drive, lots of space and the back opens up from the top and the tail gate comes down, great stereo system, the only thing I can say is the gas is not as good as the paper said on the window. It gets about 22-23 miles to the gallon not 25-30 like it says. Comfortable when you have others with you and just a all around great vehicle. I do not see many of these on the road but I bet they catch on this year! "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,DKReviewer, 12/11/2007,Both Rich and Smooth,4,"The new body design is amazing as well as the interior. Driving the car is fun, handles very well, has great acceleration but the trans is not always in the right gear, once in manual mode the paddle shifters make it a whole new ride. Even with four fairly hefty passengers it performs well. Love the exhaust note on XLS, resembles my G35 (6gr-manual). The interior has a clean and inovative look to it with clever storage everywhere and crafty 3rd row seats. Soft cloth seats are comfortable and hold you in surprisingly well, and the std sound system is great. The keyless entry makes the car so much sweeter. Overall, nice car, great buy. Mitsubishi has done well."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,rhuang, 04/17/2008,Another Satisfied Owner,5,"This is my first purchase of a new car. I owned several used car and been to leasing for few years. I've been shopping around since Dec 2007. I read many reviews and done a lot of research before test driving the CR-V, RAV4, Element, RDX, and the Outlander. After test drove the outlander, I have a second opinion about Mitsu. It turns out that the Outlander has the best value, best warranty, and best incentives in its class. I pull my trigger on March and have been satisfied after driving 1200 miles. The car looks sporty and has many functions I like. I love my ride. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Found a best buy, 05/08/2008,You won't find better small SUV for price,4,"With over 22,000 miles, it is flawless. I test drove everything from BMW X3 to Rav & nothing in this class will match the Outlander in all categories.  I traveled routinely through the worst winter conditions imaginable & this vehicle is an awesome snow machine, even with the wide/street Goodyears.  The exterior design is perfect & it stands far above the rest in looks.  There are some minor quirks such as the torque steer which is easily fixed by putting in AWD or adjusting your starts.  The Goodyears wore fast & need replacing soon.  Anyone in winter conditions will experience lower ""sandblasting"" problems to the paint (apply addit clear protection & no problems or wait till 2008-fixed."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,dugger48, 05/13/2008,"Great Car, Great Price, Fun Extras",4,"I was researching mid-sized SUV' and Crossovers for approx. 2 years before I discovered the Outlander.  All the other cars that I researched fell short of what I was looking for. The Outlander met almost all my expectations. Appearance & design: nicely designed interior and sporty exterior.  Performance and good gas mileage:  220 hp + 6spd auto tranny.  Price: $25k w/options.  Drivability: ride quality (suspension, road noise, handling), interior comfort, visibility, and interior space.  The Outlander also offers a lot of neat std. and optional equipment (see Fav. Features). I highly recommend you consider the Outlander when researching/test driving similar vehicles, youll probably buy it"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Rachel, 05/16/2008,Love It!!!,4,"Never had a Mitsubishi before, wanted a CR-V, but after I drove the Outlander, the CR-V looked terrible. So much fun to drive, very cool outside look. Love it! I got hit by an 18-wheeler, and the Outlander took it like a champ! The side-curtain airbags saved my life! Very safe. Might buy another one!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,brad, 05/21/2008,Outlander paint problems,3,"Bought 07 Outie as alternative to Rav4. Liked a lot about the Outie - value, exterior and interior styling, instrumentation, sliding rear seats, tailgate and fun to drive temperament.  Not bland. Thirsty in the city, unable to get mileage #'s anywhere near what Mitsu quotes, however very happy with highway economy. Paint chipping is something terrible. I have driven vehicles for half a year before first chip, this car had significant paint erosion after a couple of weeks city winter driving pavement. Rocker panels and rear wheel flares need to have some rock guard and durability agent put into the paint.  Took vehicle to Mitsu dealer after two weeks ownership and 100's of chips to no avail"
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,nathanas85, 05/26/2008,Stay Away - Major Paint Defect.,3,"I researched for a mid-size SUV and upon my reviews test drove the Outlander, Nissan xterra, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Honda Pilot. I found after test driving the Outlander test drove more like a smooth sports car. I fell in love with the diamond black exterior paint and the spacey interior. Overall a great vehicle to drive, per performance wise. After one winter the paint chips near the rear panel on both sides of the vehicle. I have read other Outlander owners with the same problem, a paint defect, after I purchased the vehicle. I contacted Mitsubishi about the problem and just like other customers with the same problem, Mitsubuishi doesn't honor their warranty on the paint defect."
mitsubishi,outlander,2007,Nancy S, 10/22/2020,Incredibly Reliable,5,"I have 189,000 plus miles on this now. I bought it used at 94,000 miles in 2015. I had never even heard of it before! I had to research the dickens out of it and found only rave reviews. It gets regular oil changes. The V6 is amazing. I live in NJ so there is no room for pansy acceleration. This car meets the challenge of turnpike onramps. I have the Sun and Sound package, so I enjoy the sunlight and get to blast oldies through hoards of teenagers. 
 There is nothing not to love. 
I've been looking to replace it soon, but I'm going to hold off until the engine seizes. 
Just recently, it needed brake calipers replaced, boot and axle replaced, the radiator cap assembly and a new battery. Still can't beat it. I bought it for $5,500 and it owes me nothing!

Seats do get a little uncomfortable after a bit of driving.  Set the cruise and I get about 27 on highway and 19 around town, V6 front wheel drive, that's pretty good.  I call it my Pack Mule, fold the rear seats forward and there's plenty of room to load everything from a set of bunk beds to a six foot ladder.  Done all the preventative maintenance and it's never missed a beat "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,beachin2, 09/27/2012,4 years and no issues,4,"Owned the Outlander now for 4 years and we love it !
We bought the LS and added leather.
We run nothing but Mobil 1 in it and follow all maintenance schedules.

Average 23mpg in the city and 25mpg on the highway running 70mph and loaded.

Aside from a bit loud road noise we like everything else on the car.
If Mitsubishi had added a bit more insulation this would be a perfect vehicle.

We use this as our 2nd vehicle so it only has 35k miles so far. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,nagilbaz, 12/12/2011,Great Car,4,"We bought the Outlander in late 2007. The car has not had any problems so far despite the fact that it has been in major accident. I have read most of the reviews pointing to the fact that the interior has problems with the plastic parts and there is poor paint job, which is susceptible even to minor scratches and dents. Well it is absolutely true. Nevertheless, this is the great car and a great helper. We moved several times and overloaded it with furniture and other household items. It did well. Anyway the Outlander does not claim to be a luxurious SUV and saves you a lot of money over the time. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Chad, 03/30/2010,Great Car exactly what I was looking for,4,"Best priced, best looking, crossover SUV on market.  Great performance, great space, great options, great reliability, great mpg!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,s. mitchell, 01/05/2010,2008 xls outlander,4,"I Love it!!!! Got it a couple of weeks ago and I have nothing but good things to say about it..Runs great, looks great, so much fun to drive. Looked at several types of crossover suvs and this was by far the best one. I will say that the XLS Model is the way to go. All the gadgets are very cool. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Fritz Lindstrom, 10/11/2009,Great value for your money!,4,"I bought this vehicle for use instead of my useless Ford F 150. I was a bit nervous about my first backroad/offroad trip but the Outlander handled great. It is almost as high of the ground as a truck so you can go through potholes and deep puddles.  Highway mileage is good, city mileage is decent.  It is definitely good value for money."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,cooljw, 03/10/2008,Great compact SUV and great value!,5,"I considered all the other compact SUVs out there including the RAV4 and CR-V before choosing the Outlander. The Outlander definitely has the others beat on price, styling and overall utility. Plus its a great value and costs thousands less than a comparably equipped RAV4 or CR-V. The 4 cylinder is plenty of power for me and I can use the paddle shifters to quickly downshift if I need to. The handling is very good with excellent cornering. Its nice to drive a good looking car that you dont see on the road often  I get plenty of admiring looks from people."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,John Crocker, 07/04/2008,Special Edition means just that.,5,"We have had our new Outlander SE 4WD for exactly one month and close to 2000 miles now with absolutely no problems.  The number one priority for ourselves, and many other drivers right now, is fuel efficiency. The Outlander has delivered just what it promised with a mixed city / local driving average of around 25 MPG. For a vehicle that size and weight, sometimes carrying 2 - 4 people, that figure is more than acceptable to me and I feel it may improve even more when the engine is completely broken in. Can't wait to check it out on an interstate road trip.  With good fuel mileage and the rest of the package working flawlessly, I'd rate the Outlander as a smart choice. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Peter D., 02/04/2009,"Very good, could be GREAT",4,"My wife has 07 LS 4wd. She likes it and I drive it once in a while so when time to replace my vehicle took a look at 08 leftover.  The fun thing about this car is you have to drive it. It doesn't lull you to sleep and since I drive a lot I need to be awake.  Gas mileage varies and so far best is 25 mpg in 2wd then 24 in 4wd.  My XLS drives fine especially in the messy snow, wet and ice we've had this winter in NJ."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,LoveMyOutlander, 03/15/2009,Outlander #2,5,"I owned a 2005 XLS and loved driving all 101k miles that I decided to give that one to my MIL and buy myself a new 2008 with all the new features! LOVE IT!It came fully loaded with the Sound and Sun pkg, the Entertainment DVD pkg and the Nav and Bluetooth sys. Love the 6 spd automatic tran-really see a step up in fuel economy over my 2005 one especially when using the paddle shifters to accelerate! 5 cup/bottle holders in the front! OMG the tailgate! Steering wheel controls! A real electrical outlet! The Fosgate! In 2008 sticker was 32k, since it was a floor model, I walked out at 21k before my down pymt! Couldn't be happier! in the manual, it said the upper glove can heat and cool??? WOW!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,sshadel, 12/13/2011,It's Different,3,"Pros: looks nice, Fairly good Mileage

Many cons:
When excellerating from stop , can not do it smoothly. You have to push harder on the gas peddle and then the front wheel hop takes over and you are all over the road.
Front wheels spin out all the time when starting from stop.
 Told this is normal with Outlander.
I have gone thru 2 sets of tires now (Rotate every 6000 miles to try to save them), but 3rd set is needed and only have 70000 miles on Outlander. (Last SUV Santa Fe had
70000 miles on 1st set of tires). I cant let my 17 year old drive it because of the wheel hop.
 Also radio is nuts.
You turn on and 5 to 10 seconds later it comes on. You go from AM to FM or Vice versa,
it takes 5 to 10 secondes to change over.
(Was also told that is normal).
 As you ease into a turn and begin to
accelerate the steering wheel will not begin to return by itself you have to pull it back and sometimes jerk it back .
(Also told this is normal)
.

Will have to get rid of shortly to get soemthing My 17 yr old can drive. He has no problem with our other cars just this one.

Third party part was installed instead of original part. Went to dealer to ask for repairs to be done and to be de-damaged, answer = No! Called Mitsubishi motors Canada told the story, show pictures, answer = sorry, can't help! If the original part would have been installed, it would have been covered under the warranty but since it was a third party part, only 1 year or 20 000km or warranty! Thanks to the dealer for having installed a third party part and thanks for all the problems. In 1st year, went +/- 10-12 times to dealer for electronic."

Driving it gives me a headache and my clothes absorb an ""odor"" (been ionized 2 times in service no change), steering wheel noises with right and left turns, other things but the big one is I need a new transmission which I am now waiting for (for a new car!).  I feel like there are so many things going on with this SUV that I wonder where it was before I bought it. Never had a NEW SUV with so many problems.  Services has not been good either I picked my SUV up yesterday waiting for the tranny and all the other problems still exist. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Stephen, 07/30/2008,A Very Good Car!,4,"I'm from the Philippines, where the xls is known as the ""gls sport"". It's a nice cuv, with good suspension. The roads here are not too great, but after a long drive, I don't feel beaten up. Also looks good, & people turn whenever I pass by. The car's sound system is also good, and I don't have to buy anything extra just to enjoy my cd's. A lot of new friends are impressed by the exterior & interior looks of this car. It was a toss-up between this and the forester, and i have not regretted my decision in choosing over this one. the fuel consumption is ok, esp on long drives."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,wrightsumner, 08/08/2008,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!",5,"I've had my Outlander now for 4.5 months and have already put 2000 miles on it.  It's a blast to drive, comfortable, great handling, sporty.  Lots and lots of car for the money. I got mine with all the features, 30GBHDD, DVD player/Nav system, sun roof, Rockford Fosgate sound system, Blue Tooth, and still payed thousands less than I would have for a RAV-4 or CR-V with comparable options. I'm very pleased with the gas mileage.  I actually got as much as 32mpg on a recent cross country trip.  I average between 25-30 mpg (most of my driving is highway miles).  I like the fact that I don't see many on the road.  It feels large (I feel safe driving it) but also sporty at the same time."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Darrell, 09/05/2008,2008 SE new car comments,3,As for the new 2008 SE Outlander this one is a disappointment. Sluggish off the line. Yes it is a 4 cyl. But no low end torque to speak of. The CVT is my first and am not impressed in one area. Slowing down it feels like the brakes are being applied.  My first Mitsubishi with mechanical problems from day one. Turning left a clank. Same for turning right. Rear end screech when backing. Knocking noise mid vehicle. The dealer said they could not hear the clanking so did nothing. How about putting it up on a rack and turning the wheels? Said the screeching was the brake rotors. Normal. A first for me on any Mitsubishi. Average fuel consumption is not what we want. We want exact MPG.
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Jewels, 11/11/2008,The Sleeper of the Cute Ute's!,4,"Bought fully loaded with all the extras and have never been happier. Picked it up and drove up and over the Rocky Mountains, through snow and ice etc. I got a chance to test the 4wd, the anti-skid and the anti-lock brakes (on purpose :-)). Handling was super and it really hugged the road when I tested it on the dry hairpin curves.  Easy to park compared to the Dodge 3500 Diesel 4x4 I normally have been driving! Looked at the Escape, Rav and CR-V and feel like I got more bang for my buck and a great warranty. Just wait... you will see a lot more of these in the future"

mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Keith D., 02/16/2009,An Excellent Vehicle,5,"I was looking for fun yet reliable transportation.  The Outlander fits the bill.  With the luxury, navigation and sun and sounds packages, the vehicle is simply awesome.  Even during the break-in period, the gas mileage has been impressive.  It has a very solid feel when driving and exceptionally comfortable.  It fits my family's needs perfectly.  My first car in the 80s was a Mitsubishi and I am thrilled I found my way back.  Give it a test drive, you will not be disappointed."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Quinny, 02/26/2009,So Far So Good,4,"Took a long look at many small SUV's.  Honda CRV too sluggish, Forrester (used to own one) lacked wow factor, RAV4 V6 4WD was solid but cost $2000+ more with less features.  Worried about American made being around much longer.  Wanted to stay under $30k fully loaded.  Walked out at $27,255 with 0% financing for 60 months (rather than another $2000 off) - approx. $1,500 below invoice.  Sticker on car was over $31,000 MSRP. Fun to drive, looks good, great sound system, Fast key awesome - hope to have for a long time."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Tiffany G., 02/27/2009,Great Vehicle,4,"I was looking to upgrade from a sedan but didn't want the bad fuel economy of an SUV.  This car fit the bill. This has handled great in the show and I live on country back roads so this was important.  I was hoping for a little better gas mileage than it gets in the winter but as the weather warms up, it seems to be improving and I have gotten up to 27 mpg on the highway in 2wd. My 6 year old son loves it and thinks it's the best car ever!     "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,oldkrog, 11/24/2009,Covering too many goals,3,"I wanted an suv with relatively good mileage, as much room for my autistic son as possible, good handling and a v6. Got them all in the outlander. But inside,  plastic not very good, upholstery just so-so and there is Styrofoam under the floor carpets. Glad I got it,  but wish I had gone for the xls loaded. Accelerates kinda odd,  but you adapt to it. Turn on the air or radio, nothing happens for a couple seconds, like it has to think about it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Neale, 04/01/2010,Liked it so much I bought two!,5,"Great flexibility, good gas mileage!  I have a 90 lb. Doberman who loves to ride in the back!  Very dog friendly! I don't think I have paid anything in maintenance with my dealer sending free oil change certificates and rotating my tires for free!  Great sound system, hands free phone. very comfortable seating with good support. I am getting about 23 mpg with mostly city driving."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,gski, 11/12/2007,It's Great,5,"Just picked up the 08 and there's one word to describe it, WOW!  I'm impressed. It's my first automatic in over 20 years. I'm impressed by the pickup and the paddle shifters still give me that ""standard"" feeling.  It's very roomy both in the front and back."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,gopher, 05/15/2008,Most bang for the buck,5,"Most bang for the buck. Title says it all. I never thought I'd find an SUV with great towing power for such a budget price.

mitsubishi,outlander,2008,kathy, 07/22/2010,Bad Paint on Mitsubishi Outlander!,3,"I have had this car for 2 years and can accurately review it now. I have several complaints. 1-The paint and body quality is terrible.It looks like I've been in a hail storm from the side. I have had cars for 6 years that didn't have as many dings and marks as this car does. It's a mess. 2-I have found there to be large blind spots on the bottom front windshield corners. I have, on many occasions, just missed pedestrians or cars coming from the opposite corner. The corner joining metal and the rear view mirrors create too large of a blind spot. 3-The interior being black on the red model.  The other choice was light cream (on and SUV?). It is the hottest car I have ever been in.4-Gas mileage"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,not bad!, 12/02/2007,Not bad!,4,"I just purchased a 2008 outlander in staten island i like it. Pickup from a stop isn't great but once going you forget how fast you're going. When I pass on a highway, I have to almost put the pedal to the floor but it's ok."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Sean R, 06/01/2008,Best Features for the Price,4,"I've had my Outlander XLS for almost a week now.  I compared it to the Escape/Milan, Nitro, CX-7, and a few others.  For the price you pay, this truck has some nice features.  The FAST key is one of the coolest things.  It allows you to lock/unlock, and start your truck without ever pulling the key fob out of your pocket.  Great idea! The nav/stereo system is nice and easy to operate, and loud when you need it. Bluetooth hands free for the cell is a nice touch.  Rear seats not only slide forward and back, but also recline. Plenty of room all around, and I'm 6'3"", 240.  Engine power is just fine, and in-town mileage has been at 20 mpg so far.  No telescoping steering wheel, though."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,cs, 06/25/2008,Great Car dont overlook it,4,"So I drive a ton, and I mean a ton 25k per year.  This car is a daily commuter for me.  Why do I love it?  The car is just has everything I need.  Killer stereo, great seat comfort, easy to drive, even the stock tires have worn well.  Easy and affordable to maintain and it takes 87 gas with no issue.  I get 25 mph in my daily L.A. fwy/traffic commute which is pretty good. Great NAV sys, as well as a hard drive that records my cds automatically.  Environmental stats, and a calendar that reminds me of birthdays. Heated seats, solid control, good ac, wipers work well, brakes are solid.  For what you get this car is clearly the best value in the crossover SUV market.  Take a look, you wont be sorry."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,cbk2000, 06/25/2008,So Far So Good,4,"Just bought a base XLS less than a week ago.  So far, I really like it.  Very roomy, drives and shifts very smoothly.  Very good handling.  Love the paddle shifters.  Good storage up front, too.  Waiting to see how gas mileage really is and whether I need to protect doors and rear fenders from front tire splashes."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,DD, 06/27/2008,Sleeper SUV of the year,4,"After gas hit $4+ we decided a big SUV was no longer an option for us and traded our Mitsubishi Montero Limited. After driving an Outlander demo for the weekend, we picked an XLS (need 3rd row seats) and had them add dealer installed leather.  This allowed us to forgo the forced combo pkgs and pick the primary features we wanted.  Having driven large SUVs for many years and having a Honda Accord for our ""other"" car the Outlander is a pleasant complement to our family's fleet.  We enjoy the overall stability, quality feel, and overall look of the car.  Before you buy an SUV you owe it to yourself to drive one of these."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Donna, 06/28/2008,Keeps Locking UP,4,I've had the OUTLANDER long enough to put 6500 miles on it. I love the getup and go it has. Love the handling and the comfort it offers. The center armrest isn't very workable and the driver's side cup holder next to the window broke the first time my knee hit it. I've had a big problem with the steering wheel locking up. This is Saturday night and I'm stuck at the house because the steering wheels locked and I cannot get it to unlock.
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Edward, 06/29/2008,Where have they been hiding this car?,5,"Almost made a big mistake by looking at the CR-V, RAV-4, Kia Sportage, Hyundai SantaFe and making a decision then on which one to buy. Fortunately I drove by the Mitsubishi dealer and decided what the heck, I will see what they have. The Outlander is roomier, just as comfortable and has more standard features for a better price. Was equally surprised when I found out that Mitsubishi has the same 5yr/60K bumper to bumper warranty and 10yr/100K Powertrain as Kia and Hyundai do. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Mite, 07/09/2008,Nice,4,"Great car, best that I owned so far. Just came back from my 4th of July trip-2 adults, 1 kid, trunk full of camping equipment + food + beer + water + cargo carrier on the roof - 29 mpg...wow"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,cme4brain, 08/21/2008,Excellent SUV,5,"I researched all similar SUV's- CR-V, RAV4, Forester, Santa Fe, and this is by far the best.  The closest SUV to the Outlander is the Subaru Forester, but it is nowhere near as sporty, and has only a 4-speed transmission!  I traded my Mercedes C240 and could not be happier. I am getting 26.3 mpg driving to work (mainly highway)- more than I got with my small Benz!  The CR-V is too econobox, the RAV4 has no nav nor shiftronic transmission, the Forester is too soccer mom/housewife.  Both the CR-V and RAV4 A/C is poor- can't cope with our heat!  Reliability of Mitsu is outstanding for this model, could not be happier.  As with my four prior Mitsubishis, your value for what you pay is incredible"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,fernandofi, 09/12/2008,outlander,5,"By far the best suv for the price. It has all the cool tech stuff, like premium audio, air bags, shifters paddles and bluetooth without the high price of a luxury suv."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Eric, 09/15/2008,Nice ride for the price.,4,"I enjoy the room for it's size. Decent gas mileage. Comfortable ride and great sound system. I have sun and sound package. I just wish the DVD would work when driving if you desired. Overall been real pleased with the performance up to this point. I took it on vacation and avg about 25.7 mpg. With five people loaded down and still had room for nice comfortable ride. I would recommend the Outlander to anyone looking for a sporty look in a cute ute class. It's has more room than I expected and it looks much better than the RAV4 or CR-V. These two are good in this class, but I like the looks of the Outlander. So far the performance has been up to par."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,naseer, 09/22/2008,smooth operator,4,"I just got my new mitsu outlander and it is really good, the ride very smooth. my 2.4 lacks some power but that expected and is good for low mileage. CVT is my first and it is very smooth. Turning is like a sedan, information panel is quite accessible.Lots of cup holders and power outlets. Competes with CR-V and RAV4, with a good deal it is much better than both. "

mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Caroline, 10/05/2008,Very Satisfied,4,"I bought my Outlander about 6 months ago, after months of researching and test driving several small SUVs including Toyata Rav4, Honda CR-V, Chevy Equinox, and the Saturn Vue just to name a few.  I am not disappointed.  Although the 4 cylinder lacks initial get up and go power, once its going the Outlander provides a very smooth, sporty, fun drive.  Having driven a Landrover before, I am loving the fuel economy! I'm averaging about 24 mph in the city, on a recent 8 hour trip I averaged about 32 mpg/hwy.  I would have paid thousands more for the options I have, the SE model comes loaded with a lot of unique amenities the competition just did not offer.  Overall what a great buy!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Julie, 10/16/2008,Love it!,5,"I thought my Jetta was fun to drive.  I never imagined an SUV could handle better, be more responsive, and generally be more fun to drive.  Definitely didn't have to downgrade to get a Mom-Mobile."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,fillde, 11/14/2008,very satisfied,5,Car is easy to drive. The 4 cylinder has very good power. Plenty of space. Have driven it about 1000 miles and average 27 miles a gallon. 
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Mark, 11/21/2008,Honda Is In Trouble Now,5,"Best small ute in the US for sure. Mitsu got it right. 180 degrees from the old cars. Incredible performance for the buck. Seamless 6 spd auto. Great touch nav and awesome sound system. No CDs rattling around the car with the hard drive. 3.0 V6 has so much power, torque steer is an issue. Just a real nice ride. Super warranty."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,LissaAnn, 12/12/2008,Loving my Outlander,4,"I had never considered a Mitsubishi until I was looking online at Edmunds and read the other reviews on the Outlander.  I wanted a crossover but did not like the CR-V despite the fact that i've owned 3 Hondas before this vehicle.  I love my Mitsubishi Outlander SE FWD. I have just over 1,100 miles on it already and we love it!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Piper, 12/31/2008,Good but not perfect!,3,"Now that I have 5 month of driving on my Outlander, it's time to put a good review. First, the inside insulation is not at the top, your ear a lot of road noise and the exhaust system is a bit noisy. I get an average fuel economy of 18-16 in the city and 22-24 in the highway driving. It's a great suv during the winter season, you feel secure driving around. The seat are comfortable but a lite high. The warranty is great but after driving it for a couple month, if I had to choose for my new SUV now I would not choose this one. Before buying test drive it for a day or two, you will see what I am talking about."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Wheeldog, 01/08/2009,Very satisfied with my Outlander,4,"I bought my Outlander in December 2008 after researching a number of vehicles. I kept coming back to the Outlander for its combination of performance and utility, its value, and its unique features (hard drive nav, paddle shifters, tailgate). I am very happy with my choice. The V6/6spd auto combo is very smooth and plenty powerful for a vehicle of this class. Unlike other reviewers I'm completely happy with noise levels, highway or back roads. Exhaust noise is nearly imperceptible. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Mario , 01/07/2009,You better watch out!,4,"This Outlander is exactly what you paid for, you saved a couple of grand over Honda and Toyota and you get cheap plastic all over, cheap tires and a wind noise inside once you hit 65. Over all solid, powerful and predictable vehicle. Almost forgot the carpet is the worst I have seen in a while. I own a 2003 CRV and let me tell you this one is a keeper, as soon as we are done paying for the outlander it's out of here. Back to Honda it is not worth saving a couple of grand if you plan to keep your car for more than 10 years. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Shorty, 01/26/2009,Happy Owner,4,"First Mitsubishi, and very happy.  Great car for small family (I have the third row seat option) and ideal for economical trips.  I live in a hilly area, and the power is very adequate.  With care, and respecting speed limits I get over 30 MPG on a trip, and over 19 in city driving.  My driving is approximately 35/65 city, highway.  Comfortable, and fun to drive. Road noise is very low, and handling is quick, and responsive.  Based on this experience, I'll buy Mitsubishi again!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,bruce, 05/05/2009,Paint problems,4,"While I am generally happy with the 2008 Outlander with regards to performance and comfort, I am very unhappy about the paint on the exterior. This car is not even 6 months old and it looks like every kid in the neighborhood has been throwing rocks at it. There also is a body shape design flaw that allows road debris to sand blast the front of the rear wheel fender. Mitsubishi has disappointed me with their attitude of ""too bad, so sad"" when I bring the subject of paint durability up with them. I would not buy another Mitsubishi because of this."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,MITSUMAN, 05/28/2009,Cheap interior,4,"Chose the Outlander over several other small SUV's on the market because of bang for the buck. Love the performance of the engine and 6 speed tranny. Also very glad we opted for the sun and sound package. The interior however is cheap cheap cheap! Carpet is worst I have ever seen in a new car, plastic inner door panels and seat material are very low grade as well!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,macuis, 01/01/2008,"Overall an excellent, well balanced SUV",4,"I've driven cars exclusively since my learner's license when I was 16. From a 1985 Ford Tempo GL, to a 2001 Nissan Sentra GXE, it was time for something different. Now that I'm 24, I was looking for something with a little more cargo room, a little more power, and a little more comfort for driving friends around. So I decided to take a look at the compact SUV market, and had 4 on my list: Hyundai Sante Fe, Nissan Rogue, Honda CR-V, and the Mitsubishi Outlander. The Sante Fe has a smooth, quiet ride, but didn't have many options. The Rogue was pretty stylish, but felt underpowered and cramped. The CR-V has it right, but more expensive. For me, the Outlander had a good balance of everything."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,ultrarad, 01/19/2008,I love my Anime Supershuttle,5,"I purchased my new Outlander out of state and recently drove it back to Texas.  This little trek gave me a terrific opportunity to quickly become accustomed to this car's innate abilities.  Once home, I can't believe I didn't purchase this car sooner.  Everything about this car is exciting - the design, the way it drives, the technology - I simply don't have enough time to play with it all.  If you are searching for an off-brand CUV/SUV that has driving personality, utility AND techno-enhanced design, then the Outlander should be at the top of your list.  Go on, be different and check out an automobile that has inherent off-roading qualities perfected through years of Dakar rally challenges."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Mitsu08, 07/30/2009,Good Ride,4,"I have my Outlander for about 4 months. I was looking for a small SUV to change it for my Honda Civic. I found the Outlander for excellent price. Love the exteriors; interiors are ok. I have the base model and I love it. The outlander is good in gas, no problem with that, little change from my Honda. Has lot of space front and back seats. Little exterior noises, may bother sometimes. Overall is a good purchase, no regrets. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,mazzo, 08/11/2009,This Mitsu is excellent,4,"Had the car for almost one year, never a problem, I am fully satisfied with the car.  Drives wonderfully.  I love the engine sound, excellent handling, AWD on snowy roads, and using the paddle shifters when it is time to zip away.  The design of the interior is nice, offers lots of storage, and seats are comfortable.  The Rockford-Fosgate stereo is unbelievable."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Tomak, 02/03/2008,Goodbye Earth Destroyer,4,"I traded a 2006 Montero for a 2007 'Lander and I really like my new car. The Montero was, in my opinion, a thoroughbred SUV with a peerless racing record. But with gas near $3.70/gal. here in NE Illinois, when I got a chance to trade over to the Outlander, I swallowed and went for it. I am not sorry. The 'Lander is a much more wieldy tool in traffic, goes and stops much better, and uses regular gas (the Montero needed premium). I've taken one thousand mile road trip, and the greater economy was much appreciated. It was getting blown around on the return trip, but everyone was (8 degrees, 50 mph winds)."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Jeanne Haussler, 02/06/2008,Buyer beware,4,"I was absolutely pleased with the purchase of my 2008 Outlander.  Drove it home from the dealer approx. 150 miles & it was love at first sight.  Then I drove it in the slush & snow. AWD was great, but then I washed the car & looked at the paint.  The design of the body causes chips & sandblasting to take effect on the bottom half of the vehicle.  940 miles & my red mitsu looks bad.  Put on mud flaps, but didn't stop the effect.  Everytime I drive in bad weather I cringe because more paint is being stripped.  Mitsubishi is aware, but has not come up with any solution.  Gas mileage is good as promised.  Only drive it in Fla."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,08Outtie, 11/27/2007,Satisfied owner,4,"Only owned the car for over a week. For the price of a fully loaded 4WD SUV, it beats all the competitors in the same market segment (mainly RAV4, CR-V and Ford Edge). The interior is not excessively rich, but it is comparable to the competitors. The technology features are hands down the best out of the competitors as my XLS model is equiped with touch screen harddrive based navigation, bluetooth, HID headlights, full function trip computer."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Jerry, 03/08/2008,Our 5th Mitsubishi (2nd SUV),4,"Our last SUV was the 2002 Mitsu Montero Sport XLS. Our daughter now owns this and it is still going strong. We decided to ""trade down"" to the 2008 Outlander and love the car. Just like the Montero, 100% made in Japan to last. The 4 cylinder engine will not win drag races, but is peppy enough and CVT is smooth. The engine is a little on the loud side though."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Samuel, 03/09/2008,Ultimate SUV,5,"Lots of compartments for storage. Very spacious interior. V6 power is good. Only have 1200 miles on vehicle, average about 24 mpg, switching from 2 wheel to 4 wheel drive. Sound system is excellent."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,cooljw, 03/10/2008,Great compact SUV and great value!,5,I considered all the other vehicles in this class including the RAV4 and CR-V before choosing the Outlander. The Outlander clearly has the others beat on style and utility. The Outlander makes the CR-V and RAV4 look boring. Plus you can get it better equipped for thousands less than the competition. The long warranty provides great peace of mind. The handling is quite sporty with little body lean when cornering. The 4 cylinder provides plenty of power for me with good fuel economy and I can use the paddle shifters if I need to downshift quickly. Overall I am very pleased with this vehicle and might just be a Mitsubishi convert considering it's the first one I've ever owned.
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,CW, 03/13/2008,Not your cookie cutter small SUV,4,"It came down to the Outlander and RAV4. The Outlander looks a lot better, has a lot more technology and a superior warranty and provided more for the money. We really like the car and would highly recommend to anyone. If we had it to do all over we would buy the Outlander again."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,larry , 03/23/2008,interior lighting,4,"I owned a 2005 endeavor and was very happy with it except the gas mileage. I purchased a 2008 outlander XLS v6 3.0 awd and was sorry to see that there are not any interior lights in the glove compartment or on the dials for the temperature settings, and fan speed or positions for the vent direction. Cannot set any of the 3 dials at night while driving or go from 2wd to 4wd."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,New Mitisubishi fan, 04/21/2008,Love my Outlander,4,"I originally wanted a RAV-4, I'm glad I got the Outlander.  It has a lot of pick up for a 4 cylinder, like the braking, pretty smooth ride, like the big tires. Amazed at the gas mileage, I was used to driving an SL1 Saturn. Some days I average 30 miles to the gallon, never less than 25.  I really can't say enough good things about it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Marc, 04/27/2008,The truth,4,"Owned car since nov. 06/1500 miles was one trip. Owned Mitsubishi before so stayed with brand (no problems). Had hesitation problems but service bulletin cured that. On road trip car is outstanding just sit back and put on Cruise and front wheel drive (28 mpg) around town not impressed with mpg or noisy motor, like all available features (best bang for buck). I have had no problems with this vehicle at all, what you see and hear when you purchase is what you get. I was rearended at 40 mph (car stops on a dime) and lower tailgate still opened, car took impact really well. My main pet peeve is the interior fit and finish are starting to look sloppy/lazy. Where`s that quality Mitsubishi?"
mitsubishi,outlander,2008,Norsekid, 05/19/2008,Great Buy,4,"This vehicle is a ""sleeper"". Very sophisticated drivetrain, did I mention a 6 speed transmission? Tight handling, pretty quiet tires, could be better. Killer upgraded stereo, heated leather seats and the rear hatch has a lower section that drops down if you unlatch it. Great for sitting down to take off you boots, etc. Gas mileage is ""foot"" sensitive. Still trying to figure where it is but seems to be around 20 mpg city and some highway. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Jeff Launiere, 12/25/2009,Mitsubishi Outlander Rocks,5,"This is likely the best vehicle I have ever owned. As some say the low end acceleration is not great, but it is fine. The Outlander has a real quality feel and is fun to drive. I tried the Honda CRV, Mazda CX7, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Murano, Kia and Hyundai and this was simply the best. And the price is better than all of these. I absolutely recommend this vehicle to anyone, other than the Navigation System unless you use it in an area where no new streets are put in."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,nels79, 02/19/2013,Everthing I was searching for!,4,"After searching high and low for a family car, I came across the Outlander. I was tipped off by being the chosen brand for the Paris/Dakar endurance race as the support vehicles being that they were champs 10y in a row. That said, I wanted something that you don't see passing by you 50 times a day on the road. Its a pretty unique SUV.
This is my first SUV but I'm familiar with the Jeeps and Murano. So far I am very please with it, I got the lower end 4C engine for better gas economy. Still had all the power I need on and off the road. The paddle shifts work great when you need to downshift and take off! Snow, rain, sand and mud. No Problem! Great features and fuel economy at good price tag!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,hunh, 11/14/2011,Mitsubishi Outlander Lease Experience,5,The car was fine; the company is quite slimy. They did not respond to complaint letters. Then they tried to bill me thousands in phony repairs. They also tried to charge a late fee. The car was returned late because the person they asked me to contact was on vacation for two weeks. Then he turned out to be a slaesman from Mitsubishi trying to sell me a new car. What a mess!
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Nathan, 01/24/2019,Reliable and comfy but under-powered with the 4cyl,4,"I bought my SE 2wd new in 2009. What drew me to it was the price and styling.  After almost 10 years of ownership, I am happy with this car.  My only regret is not going with the 6 cylinder engine.  The 4 cylinder is embarrassingly under-powered.  Being coupled to a CVT makes it even worse.   The CVT hampers the engine with no real MPG benefits.  I get an average of 22.4 MPG, with about half city/half highway.  I would gladly give up a mile or two to have some more power with a regular transmission.  The power from a stop on this car is almost dangerous.  There have been times when I wanted to make a left turn in front of traffic and did not know if I could make it because I was hesitant if my engine would kick in.  In reference to the engine's power; I took it on a trip loaded with 4 people and luggage and it was an uphill venture.  The engine overheated twice and was running at top RPM the entire time.  There is just not enough power, coupled with the CVT.  This car has been very reliable over the years.  I have had no issues, other than dealer recalls.  The regular parts that wear out can be more expensive than American-made parts.  If I had it to do again, I would probably not buy this care because of the overpowered engine/CVT.  This car would make an excellent first car for a teenager or for a housewife who just shuttles kids around.

mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Tanya1921, 11/29/2010,"OK Overall, But 3 Warranty Visits in 1yr",3,"Overall, the Outlander is great. Awesome sound system (stock), but the doors don't automatically lock, and I have taken it in 3x in a year for warranty repairs: molding on kick plate came off, A/C adapter stopped working, and excess glue on the windshield which was causing all the wiring to be exposed. My Honda's never had problems like this. It gets time consuming and my time is worth something. Paddle shifters are useless-  no one really uses them in a 4 cylinder SUV. I have to yell at the bluetooth speaker to be heard."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,nicole, 05/18/2009,Just bought it,3,"I drive 30,000 miles per year in all kinds of weather.  I needed cargo space and 4wd.  This was the most reasonably priced, least ugly vehicle in this category.  I never buy new, but finding something with low mileage would've cost me close to what this cost me new.  I don't expect luxury in this price range - and I sure didn't get it, but it's decent looking, inside and out.  I'm not thrilled about the velour cloth seats, I don't think they'll hold up. Dash and side interior panels are a weird textured rubbery material that seem to mark up fast.  Maybe some protectant will fix that."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,nicole, 11/28/2009,Good value if you don't drive a lot,3,"Here is an update from 5/09.  If you are easy on the gas pedal you will be rewarded with avg mileage of up to 30+mpg.  Seat covers and rubber material on dash are poor - they are dust and hair magnets.  Bad choice.  I drive 100 miles, 5 days per week.  I do not have lumbar/back problems, I do now.  My back is aching, seats are extremely uncomfortable.  Good value if you don't drive a lot.  Otherwise, look at something else or get leather, maybe that helps.  "
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Becky Peterson, 06/23/2009,Tops all small suvs,4,I love my Outlander.  I've had it for 7 months and have just about 10k miles on it.  It was awesome in the snow with the 4wd option and has plenty of clearance.  I love the smart key!  The stereo is exceptional and I love the 6 disc cd changer!  The only thing that makes me a little crazy is the air leak noise when the sunroof is CLOSED.  This vehicle is fun to drive and easy to maneuver.  I wish I would've purchased the V6 but I was being careful with the gas mileage.  
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Nick, 01/28/2009,Quality & looks in one,4,"2009 ES in red and black interior -  2wd My wife loves this SUV. Did not need extra stuff like 4wd or navigation or high end radio. Handles great, good mpg, looks nice. Rides very smooth on highway. Radio works well, plenty space for five or six. Tailgate is nice feature for loading and unloading. Car feels and looks more expensive than is was. Interior looks sharp. 10 year warranty."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Greg, 05/11/2009,Happy customer,5,"The outlander has exceeded all my expectations.  I chose it for the technology features like the navigation, music server, sound system, and backup camera.  None of the competitors had anything even close in its price range.  Driving is smooth, quiet, yet powerful."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,IPC, 05/22/2009,More People Should Check This CUV Out,4,"3 Months of ownership with no issues at all.  Comfortable, rides smooth, responsive steering, fantastic sound system and great cargo space.  Looked at/test drove the Rav4, Santa Fe, CRV, XL7, Rogue, Equinox and have no regrets on buying the Outlander."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Brian, 06/07/2009,Very Happy Customer,4,"This is my first SUV. I needed more cargo space than my sedan could offer. I test drove the vue, equinox, escape, journey, nitro before looking at the outlander. This offered everything I was looking for and really enjoy driving it. I like the steering wheel radio controls, the in-floor storage (I don't have the 3rd row seat). I like all the safety and stability features. The 4 cyl is good, but because I have a lead foot could use a little more get up and go. I have to still get used to speedometer on left side of the display. Offers great warranty. Gets good gas mileage for an SUV. Great safety ratings. Not sure why you don't see more of them on the road. This is a great SUV especially for the $$."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Serge, 09/24/2009,Best Small/med. size SUV out there!!,4,"Purchased this Canadian version model LS AWD V-6 and realize it is the Best SUV that I have driven!  It is so smooth and comfortable on the road, you think you are driving a sport sedan.  You don't even need to floor it when passing 3-4 slower vehicles on the highway, it surges with such authority and speed...the engine revving sound will please your hears! Consumption: Did 9.6 litres for 100 kilom. on the highway at around 110-115 kilom.  Love this truck!!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Babs8, 10/01/2009,Why are there not more?,4,"It baffles me that I don't see more of these on the road.  Every time I tell someone about my new car, they've never heard of it.  But then they see it and they love it!  I researched vehicles in this segment obsessively, while I waited for the Cash for Clunkers deal to go into effect- I had been driving a '99 Jeep Cherokee for the past 7 years and when the A/C broke, it was time to go.  While I never considered myself into features (the Jeep had hardly any), I am amazed at how many features I got on the Outlander for the price.  Far better deal than any of the competitors.  After 2 months of driving I can proudly say that I have absolutely no buyer's remorse. Love it!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Calvin, 12/02/2009,Top notch on everything,4,"Ok,  imagine,  I purchase this Fantastic 2009 SUV not knowing that the 2010 version would be much improved...Lol!  Doesn't matter because this 2009 is just awesome,  top notch on everything, smoothness, superb handling, Power that will put to shame a Acura MDX (that costs 40% more) on the street.  Style, AWD system that LOCKs and is head and shoulders above the competition (the 2010 version is even more efficient). Mitsubishi is out to prove THEY are the best engineered vehicle in the world...period! Toyota and Honda's watch out. The King is waking up!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,gulati, 02/08/2010,Ladybug,4,"Our XLS AWD is Rally Red, and aptly named Ladybug! Wasn't so sure about leaping for a SUV, having driven cars for nearly 30 years, but the Outlander is very responsive and easy to drive. Not so sure about reliability yet, but after 20 years of sturdy Mitsus, I'm not terribly worried. Only concern would be mpg, but the trade-offs - comfort, utility, safety - seem to make it all worthwhile."

mitsubishi,outlander,2009,HG, 02/24/2009,Recommended,4,"I wanted a small SUV for under $25k that excelled on looks, warranty, standard features, and Edmunds Editor's Rating. Of the 10 vehicles I compared, the only one that landed in the top 3 on all 4 of my lists was the Outlander SE.  Then I test drove the Outlander and the Honda CR-V EX, which is often regarded as the leader in this segment.  The CR-V is more refined (quieter engine and ride, nicer interior materials) and has a better 5-year resale value.  But I was swayed by Outlander's equipment, warranty, and appearance.  As for resale value, by that time I'll be 70 and have bigger things to worry about.  Bottom line:  This is a nice vehicle, especially if you don't need a plush interior."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,cn, 01/06/2009,Great small SUV,4,"I have had my 09 Outlander for 2 weeks now and it's great. Handling is very good, I like the steering. Navigation is good but sometimes complicated to use, stereo has great sound strong bass. Fuel economy is just ok, but I expected that, I average around 23- 26MPG (highway). I enjoy driving it to work and all the features work great so far, glad I decided to buy it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,MrLoopy, 01/24/2009,Really fun to drive,4,Had the car for three weeks now. The car feels much more like a sports car then a small SUV! The suspension is very tight (as the reviews say) but I think this makes it feel like a low slung sportster. The seats are comfortable. Just love the way it drives. It is a small SUV though (we came from a Jeep Grand Cherokee) but has nice styling. Has enough power for fast acceleration. Very happy with the car so far.
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,TJ, 04/13/2009,Great lil SUV,4,"Just purchased my wife the XLS AWD w/ navigation. After reading a lot of expert reviews I was skeptical. But most of the complaints were that the V-6 was slow and the interior was really cheap. I would agree that the interior is not the most expensive materials used, but they are lighter weight and help reduce the total weight of the vehicle. We have no complaints with the engine, I mean it's not a dragster and it has plenty of pep. I am 6'04 and am able to sit in the back seat easily even with the driver seat all the way back. The stereo and navigation system are awesome, truly. Very hard to beat Mitsu's warranty and safety rating. Much bigger than it looks. All in all, great lil SUV."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,eelly, 04/21/2009,Outlander 2.4 2009,4,"I bought the outlander after test driving rav4 and crv. I like the outlander looks and its price of course, unlike rav which I believe is overpriced. Honda crv is better in acceleration, Rav4 is more car like when you drive. Outlander is heavier, but more stability in curve although a bit slow during start but can be faster if you use the techtronic options. Overall it's worth the money compared to Rav4 and CRV. Forget about resale value - just enjoy driving it... no regrets."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Cosme1, 04/28/2009,ES AWD Review,4,"This is my second day with this ""CUV"" and can tell already (as long as no problems come up) that it will be in the family for at least the next 5-6 years. It's comfortable, rides smooth, and it has all the space in the world as far as cargo. We test drove the comp. (rav4, santa fe, equinox, forester) and this was it - the Outlander took the prize."
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,Upstate Gal, 06/09/2009,Love it! Love it! Love it!,5,"I have been driving this vehicle for about six weeks and absolutely love it.  Was deciding between the Nissan Rogue and Outlander and glad I made this choice.  For all of the features and options, the price point could not be beat.  The exterior is extremely stylish!  The interior is decent as well.  The dash materials are so-so, but I use protectant cloths to keep them clean and scuff free.  Having two glove boxes is great for storage.  All of the cup holders and extra storage places are a bonus!  I have the third row seat which is small, but convenient.  When the seat is folded, you can't beat the cargo space.  I made the right decision on the 2009 Outlander and highly recommend it!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2009,AP_From PA, 07/07/2009,A g vehicle at a great price!,5,"I bought this outlander ES (FWD) base + Conv. pkg in Black on 28 June 2009.  This vehicle runs great and performs as expected or better considering that this is a 4 Cyl engine.  Fuel economy on a 70 mile straight highway was about 29 mpg, and my usual driving of a 20 mile trip (80% Hwy) gives about 25-26 mpg.  There seems to be a very faint buzzing sound, I need to look into that.  Lots of cargo room, and comfortably seats 3 avg. adults in the back seat.  Seats are nice and firm and are very comfortable on long drives.  I am happy with this purchase."

Good & plentiful electronics are intuitive and well thought out;  steep learning curve to use efficiently. Same for 2nd & 3rd row seat positioners. Hard to see instruments & Nav in bright sunlight.

I was driving a '09 Civic Si and was growing tired of a manual. The Outlander is one of the sharpest looking SUV's I've seen and the room inside is amazing. My salesman was 6'4"", 240lbs and with the front seats all the way back- sitting in the back seat his knees did not touch. IMPRESSIVE!!! The price was great for everything I got including the extras. I am very pleased. Only had it for a week and immediately packed it up to go camping- exceeded my expectations."

I love the ""sun and sound"" option, the rear door opening and ""tailgate"" and overall space for the ""stuff"" I cart around. I love that I can fit my bike inside, although I do have a usable rack if needed. Other storage room and cup holders are more than adequate. For the money, this is a great performing vehicle.

Only had mine for 2 weeks but it's proving itself the right vehicle for me. After 2+ years of not driving a 4WD SUV I had to get back to what was right for me and my dogs. This vehicle is spacious especially with the back seat folded forward. The fuel economy is better than I had hoped after only 2 weeks - averaging ~24mpgs combined. Handles well, can't wait for snow - actually I can wait forever for snow but by Lake Erie in northeastern Ohio it won't be long. A little hard to keep clean, the interior attracts and holds dog hair. Wish I had all leather interior. "

With a growing, athletic son and two large dogs, we needed to return to having an SUV for toting everyone around.  Having previously owned both a Pathfinder and a Highlander, we were familiar with the virtues/vices of both truck- and car- based SUVs.  We researched the Outlander thoroughly, and this model is recommended by both Edmunds and Consumer Reports.  In fact, this model gets the nod over the 6 cyl, and we agree with that assessment.  It is truly a great value purchase: fun to drive, very good technology, comfortable, and highly useful.  The vehicle is thoughtfully designed.  Yes, they could have used nicer interrior  materials.

mitsubishi,outlander,2010,macpower, 09/24/2010,Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon,4,Toothless because it feels a underpowered at first. Then you start to play with the paddle shifters and mold the performance to your liking. Now you have a really fun ride. Peak torque at 41-4200 rpm means you almost have a turbo-feel when you think the motor's starting to bog down. My wife and I are 6' tall and the interior boasts a lot of legroom. The drivers side has a slight height adjustment too. I stuck an ipod in the cup holder and wanted a small slot so I could access the A/V rca's in the console. I thought there should be a small slot for the wires to hang through - and there was one - right where I wanted it! That's the best part of this car. A lot of thought went into everything!

This is the best combination of style, performance, interior comfort, and reliability for the money.
You will not be disappointed.
Even with a distant dealer, I bought the car as it is so reliable- this is my 6th Mitsubishi.
The rear back up camera, the integrated Audio and NAV systems are excellent, as are the modifiable computer controls.

On paper it may seem slow, but you must learn how to drive it properly, it will do 0-60 in 7 secs and handles amazingly due to S-AWC. All my friends compliment me on how cool my car is. We use it to cart around the family, commuting, and road trips, its perfect for almost anything. The ride is smooth and comfy, the brakes and steering are great because they give good feedback. MPG is right there with the EPA, 18/25. Car is technologically packed!! The Nav system is worth it when you dig through it"
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,tvanbergen@charter.net, 11/04/2016,Only car I have had towed twice,2,"I bought this as we live in the snow belt and it was a 4WD.  It did go very well in the snow, slips on rainy roads though.  In 35 years of driving I have never had to have a car towed.  This has been towed from my house twice and this time the transmission is gone.  It is 6 years old with 120,000 highway miles on it.  It has never towed anything, been driven hard, etc.  I now do not have a trade in even and no vehicle.  I am going back to Honda's with my purchase that I am now forced to make this weekend as $9,000.00 to replace transmission and blue book is only about $7,500.00.  The Outlander does have good cargo space and was happy with that, easy to drive (when running) and as I said, good in the snow.  Seats are hard, we figured they would break in but they never did.  My bluetooth works on the drivers side but not the passenger side.  Very disappointed in this vehicle.

mitsubishi,outlander,2010,James, 10/30/2010,Much better than Ford Edge,5,"This is my 1st brand new SUV and I am very impressed by how it drives. Not to mention the unbeatable standard ""BUMPER TO BUMPER"" warranty not just the transmission like all of the American SUVs."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Emma, 08/21/2010,Love!,4,"I absolutely love this vehicle.  The technical features are outrageous.  It handles more like a car, not an SUV.  Have driven on snow and ice and feel very confident in this vehicle.  Very roomy in the back with the back seats folded.  Love the look, especially from the front. Wouldn't trade it for anything. By-the-way, this vehicle tells you if you need to switch from 2 wheel drive to 4 wheel drive when it senses a wheel spin or slip, how COOL is that?"
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Noeffectx, 08/24/2010,"Fun CUV, best bang for the buck",4,"The day after I bought my GT, have to take it back to the dealer, because the air compressor got shot, but knowing Mitsubishi's awesome warranty, I know I was covered. My local dealer Lasorsa Mitsubishi replaced my air compressor free of charge. I drove 700 miles on it now and I love it.  I was considering the Subaru Forrester XTi Limited before the GT, but after I test drove the GT's 6cyl w/ Rockford/fosgate sound systems it was no contest. Best bang for the buck! Outlander GT is the best CUV for the price and performance."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,icharles, 06/20/2011,Extremely disapointed,3,"I have had my Outlander since December 2009. While it is fun to drive and has very comfortable seats, I have been very disappointed in the build quality and reliability.

1) After 14k I started hearing a knocking/creaking in the rear right brakes. Dealer said it was caused by rust. After two failed brake services Mitsu replaced the rotors under warranty - fixed. Now, at 38k the problem is back. Mitsu again said the problem was caused by rust and would not fix it under warranty (new rotors only have 24k on them).

2) I have a multitude of paint chips on the front hood after only 1.5 years of driving. I had a Honda Civic for 4 years prior to this vehicle and never noticed one.

3) Creaky seat"
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,gmo, 04/05/2010,My First Mitsubishi is a great vehicle!,5,"My switch from a full size Ford pickup to a suv came when I needed a newer vehicle to drive in heavy Nashville traffic. The 2010 Outlander has been great so far with better than expected gas mileage and comfort. I researched the SUV line heavily between a Subaru Forrester,Toyota Rav 4, and the Outlander. I am 6ft. 3 and the Outlander by far is the most comfortable. I would recommend to anyone. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,michal, 05/06/2010,Finally,4,The car drives more like a nice size sedan than an SUV. Grips the road nicely and takes corners well.  Seating takes a little to get use to but once you find your spot and adjust your seat it feels great. Excellaration-just breaking the car in-you get a good response (a little delay) when you hit the gas pedal. I'm getting about 24.7 mpg at speeds of about 70 to 75. 
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,4DogsCon, 07/27/2010,A/C issue not even 24 hours of ownership,3,"I have had this vehicle for less than 24 hours and already in for service.  First time Mit. owner and maybe the LAST.  Never had this problem with others-- then given loaner and told ""make sure you put the same amount of gas in it.""  You kidding me?  I have to check in my brand new SUV for 3-5 days for service and you have the nerve. Unbelievable.  So far first impression is not too good.  Other than that I thought the value was good although I hope this isn't the type of value yet to come."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Annieb, 08/01/2010,Not a bad car!,4,"This is my first SUV and couldn't decide between the outlander and the Subaru Forester. Very, very close comparison. What put me over was the Outlander actually has better pick up (4 cyl) than the Subaru does. Seats are more comfortable on the Subaru (why do car makers not add lumbar support for all their cars?) The Outlander also has tighter steering which I prefer. Pound for pound, I feel the Outlander is a good car! So far, have not been disappointed. If you are considering a small SUV, don't rule out the Outlander. "

The terrain is a dry grass hill cover with about 15 inches of snow and incline about 20% (not so sure) and here the results:
4RUNNER :done it in 1 attempt,OUTLANDER :2 attempts,FORESTER:4 attempts,CRV:after about 10 attempts made it 30 feet ! What the hell...it's the most Awards and comments vihicle here,but not at this,I gess.Im happy with My Outlander after 45k.Here's a thing you need to know:To drive fast use the paddle shifter not the D drive."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Outlander Buyer, 08/10/2010,Stay Away From Mitsubishi,2,"I just bought 2010 Outlander XLS in one week and drove in 5 times, the air conditioner stopped working. There is leaking! Such quality."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Jim, 03/12/2010,Gotta love it!,4,"We've had our GT now for about 600 miles and love it! We thought about other SUVs but our last one , a 2003 Outlander, was flawless so we thought why beat ourselves up? We love the looks, and driving it's a blast. We owned a Subaru WRX before, so we know fun driving! Gas mileage can be fairly decent if you can drive like an old lady. I tried it once and got 27.2 on the cars computer! It just hurt to drive that slow though. Road noise is a minor complaint but the Rockford Fosgate stereo takes care of that.The third row seat is a joke but we don't need it so who cares? Like the drop tailgate too. There's too many good things to talk about so I'll just say we give it a 9.5-10!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,desarge, 04/11/2010,First SUV,4,"During the recent winter storms in DC the SUV rode so smoothly over the snow and ice, it was refreshing to watch everyone else get stuck while we drove around freely. The back seat has plenty of space for passengers, since my son is driving it with my wife, I spend plenty of time in the back seat. Cargo space is actually bigger then the space we had in our minivan; that was unexpected. Gas mileage is wonderful for a car this size."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Not a Zero, 08/28/2010,A Hidden Gem of a CUV!,4,"Just bought a 2010 Outlander XLS V6 AWD.  It's handling is sharp and the ride is firm but not harsh.  Good feedback from the road and drives like a car with a low center of gravity.  Acceleration is brisk and the 6 speed transmission is fun to shift with the paddle shifter. Body roll is minimal and I find myself taking corners faster and more confidently than I would normally be with a SUV.  A/C is very cold and much appreciated in 100+ degree Texas heat. Very satisfied with the purchase on 0%, 60 months financing and a longer than typical warranty.  The Outlander is a hidden gem of a CUV that driving enthusiasts will love."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,j ortiz, 09/20/2010,Bad front end,4,Love this car but it is horrible on potholes and dips on the road when it hits one it makes banging noise like metal on metal took it to the dealer they said nothing was wrong with it i have own many cars and never heard a sound like that one day i was on the expressway and the car in front of me jam on his brakes so i did to and it made the bang noise wish i could fix it would be the perfect cuv 
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,George D, 04/14/2019,At 100k no problems at all!!!,5,"Bought it brand new with 7 miles on it.Great commuter ,very reliable no issues !!!Only set back is that loses value more than other japanese brands.Highly recommended!!!

mitsubishi,outlander,2010,khm2010, 01/09/2010,Value and Excellent driving manners,4,"Purchased V6 XLS with luxury package 3 weeks back. Drives like a car has good cornering, road grip and no rolling effect. Does not feel heavy at all. Fuel mileage is as expected i,e 18/25 in 2WD mode but RAV4 has the best class mileage for V6. Like the contrasting leather, fit & finish. Lot of storage locations. Has a good usable cargo space due to length of the vehicle, but to gain more volume wish they made 3rd row seats optional in this package and body wider. 2nd row seats are the best in terms of configuring. Seats are firm , may lost longer."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,gabesta, 01/28/2010,2010 Outlander GT,4,"I've only had my Outlander for 10 days, but so far it is the best vehicle I've owned. I love the styling, both inside and out. I would not recommend this vehicle for anyone who plans on utilizing the 3rd row seat regularly, as it is quite small. However, with that stowed, and the 2nd row moved back, there is adequate room for 5 adults (even if they are on the tall side). The V6 is peppy, and the S-AWC handles aggressive cornering well. True 4wd would be nice on the GT (to save on fuel), but overall economy is still relatively good. I love the FAST key system, as well as the ease of use with the NAV package. Overall, it is an awesome vehicle."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,old and slow, 01/31/2010,Value,4,"I researched this very competitive market in depth, many good choices but none were a better value when considering everything.  MSRP $24,705 Invoice $23,333 Sale Price $22,199 and received full Blue Book Trade In Value for my trade in.  Also, 0% financing for 36 months.  Lastly,5 yr bumper to bumper, 5 yr road side assistance, and 10 yr power train warranties. Mitsubishi's however don't hold their value as trade ins, so a negative if you will sell or trade in after a few years, with low mileage."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,arelle20, 02/16/2010,My First Mitsubishi,4,"So far, I am pleased with the handling of my 2010 Outlander.  The 3.0V6 is nicely responsive on both city streets, as well as on the highway.  Fuel economy is not as indicated on the brochure but that may be the result of my somewhat aggressive driving. With the 230HP powertrain, it's so easy to enjoy the thrill of experiencing ""G-force acceleration"" without breaking any laws.  We haven't had much snow in our area, so can't say much about the 4WD except that I can hardly wait to put it through it's paces."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Argentum, 02/26/2010,Happy That We Bought IT,4,"With a recommendation from Consumer Reports and good reviews here at Edmunds and elsewhere, we were confident about the purchase. Also, we own an Eclipse GT which we love. So we traded in our trusty 2002 CRV and never looked back. The ride is a big upgrade from our Honda. It is smooth and composed, corners nicely and the steering feedback is excellent.  Though there is some wind noise."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,fushigi, 03/04/2010,3 Month/2200 Mile Review,4,Tomorrow marks 90 days of ownership. So far I have no complaints at all.  Best MPG: 24.7; worst 17.3; averaging 20 using regular gas.  I expect improvement once it's fully broken in and the weather warms up (no winter-blend gas).  Driving is a simple pleasure.  I've used the paddle shifters for passing power a couple of times; it's a nice feature even if it won't be used daily.  The audio system is just amazing.  The auto-rip of CDs is a great feature though making your own play lists takes a little getting used to.  Not sure if I could ever buy another car without a rear backup camera now (can spot small children behind the car easily; essential in my area).  S-AWC works great in snow/slush.
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Nikki, 04/06/2010,Great Sporty SUV,4,"Purchased a XLS V6 Outlander, had it now for 500 miles. Can't wait for the break in period to finish. Technology wise this car is packed with it. Rain Sensing Wipers, Keyless entry/starting, subscription- free traffic service, the list goes on. my family wanted something different instead of a typical Rav4 or Cr-v so we decided on this great Outlander. It has great in your face styling and has the power to back up it's look. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,BobJ, 04/09/2010,Tremendous 2 or 4 drive option!,5,The best thing about this car is the ability to drive in either 2 wheel or 4 wheel drive option.    I live in the Northeast and I use the 4 wheel drive in bad weather. The rest of the year I will use the 2 wheel drive option--- I get about 30 mpg with this option.  ALL THE SUVs should have this option.
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Bennett, 04/26/2010,Driving a Road Less Traveled...,5,"Bought AWD Outlander GT at Chicagoland dealership (live in MI... vehicle STILL very difficult to find here in upper-level trims)... at first underwhelmed by 'Rally Red' color- first choice was Quartz Brown with lighter interior- but I'm coming around to appreciate this classic ""mid-life-crisis"" colored vehicle. Looks fantastic in overcast skies: for some reason brings out its subtleties and various hues.  Mileage is WAY better than expected(about 2500 miles on it already).  My commute is long- 95 miles each way- across varieties of roads, including city stop-and-go, 2-lane highways(55mph) and freeways (70mph). Averaging on trip computer mpg 27-29!!! Also love its gadgetry, tailgate/storage."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,Glenn, 05/05/2010,Love Car but don't buy from Nashua,4,"This SUV has lived up to the good reviews I read before buying.  This XLS AWD V6 handles well on the roads and corners with decent acceleration.  I love the options with XLS and choose the XLS which includes the option of Leather Heated Front Seats, among other decent options including Satellite. When I negotiated the price of the car, it supposedly came with Satellite which was an option I was looking for.  However, after the dealership gave me a short demonstration on how to activate the options of the car, which I verified verbally and was given info from the dealership to activate. I learned it did not.  I had to pay  for it because it was not on the sales slip.  Big Mistake on my part."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,mastersarge, 06/05/2010,Wonderful SUV,4,The Outlander was purchased just before the great snow storm of 2010 in DC: Could not be timed any better. The Outlander rode on ice and snow as though the roads were clear and free. Handling is as good as you expect from a SUV. The sound system is wonderful and the finish is perfect. All the controls are easily accessible and conveniently located. The only item we wish we had: a compass. great feature: how many miles left on a tank of gas.
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,cp2010, 06/22/2010,I love my MO!,4,"I decided to get rid of my truck for something more practical but I didn't want to look like a soccer mom. So I steered clear of the more popular compact suvs and fell in love w/ the Outlander. It's a blast to drive! The sound system is great (6 disc changer was a nice surprise), but the cool new redesigned grill is really what drew me to it. It looks pretty tough going down the road! I've had it for just over 3 months now and I'm more in love every time I jump in the driver's seat. The visibility is really good and it's very easy to park. Overall, I am completely satisfied w/ my decision to get an Outlander and I plan to drive it for another 10 years. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,edwin, 07/09/2010,Impressive cuv,5,"We needed an SUV in the house, to join a Toyota sienna and a BMW 330i. The bimmer impresses with handling and refinement, the sienna with space and comfort. Looked at the Forester and outback before biting the bullet on the outlander. I must say, very happy with the purchase. This cuv continues to impress with just how well it does things, how smooth and refined it is, and all the bells and whistles mitsu was able to cram in this package. It's an absolute techno Wonder - with the handling that would put a lot of other SUV's to shame. Value for dollar - it ranks really high. The performance and the looks - bonuses! My wife and I love the outlander."
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,bdoura, 08/04/2010,Love my Black-GT,4,"I owned a 2000 Montero Sport prior to purchasing the 2010 Outlander GT, in February, 2010. Mitsubishi makes excellent product at competitive pricing. My Black GT looks great, performs very well, and not bad on MPG (About 20-21 average). My only suggestions to Mitsubishi are regarding the tires and doors. The Good-Year Eagle LS2 radials are not the best choice for rain or snow. I bought a new set of wheels and tires for winder driving (NOKIAN - Hakkapeliitta R SUV) they are the best tires at a great price. The doors on my GT feel light and must be slammed to close. They dealer said there was nothing that could be adjusted. Overall, I love my Black-GT"
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,1stXmitsuowner, 08/18/2010,"Not driven a lot yet , But enjoying it!",4,"Nice sporty ride, tight handling and good MPG so far!  Sharp looking and peppy for a 4 cyl. Wish I upgraded to moon roof and R/F sound system. But sound not bad! Bought because of value and warranty. Looked at Kia, Mazda and Ford prior to buying the Outlander!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,kurly, 09/23/2010,Very satisfied with my 2nd Outie,4,"Before this one, I had a 2005 model, which I loved, and was devastated when I totaled it in a rollover accident (from which I escaped with just a few minor cuts and bruises!). I couldn't wait to buy another one. I have it in Rally Red and it's gorgeous! It's not perfect, though. My air compressor crapped out a few months ago, a common occurrence, apparently. I also have somewhat squeaky brakes, which I had checked out and was told it's not due to mechanical defect. I'm only at 2300 miles, so maybe it will resolve itself. I also wish that acceleration was smoother when merging and passing on highways. Despite these gripes, six months into ownership, I am very pleased with it. No regrets!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2010,NL, 01/16/2020,It deserve more accolade,4,"As the title says, Outlander GT deserve better comment from professional reviewers. That's fine, cause I get better discount at dealers. Once I test drive the GT model, I am surprised at how well it handles. Plus, there is 5 and 10 years warranty, and at price 30% below its competitors. I bought a 2010 Outlander since new and still going strong, no problem at all. This is my third Mitsu. The other is an RVR.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,tmo411, 04/26/2011,Great Little SUV!,4,"I just got my Outlander recently, but I've put 500 miles on it already. It handles great, and the V6 is very smooth. It also has a nice engine growl when you gun it a little. I got the GT model, but without all the bells & whistles. The stock stereo has a 6-CD changer, 140 watts and 6 speakers - plenty for my use. The seats are cloth centers with leather backs & sides - they felt more comfy than the full leather. You can aim the HID headlights, and they're really bright. I love the paddle shifters, too. The back seat has plenty of room for my 6'+ sons to sit in, so they like it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,geezerman, 06/21/2011,Suprising vehicle,4,"I traded in a Toyota 4Runner on a 2011 Outlander, after checking out all the competition.
It was the only vehicle which met my criteria for interior/exterior size, power, mileage, warranty, and price.

I was suprised that I was able to fit all the ""stuff"" I had in the 4Runner in the interior bins and pockets, and was suprised to see it had two large glove boxes.
Also love the handy tool/stuff storage bin under the rear floor.

I am getting 24 mpg around town and around 30 on the hwy., and think this is outstanding in a roomy and adequately powered small SUV.



I told the dealer they need to have a better advertising program on this vehicle, as a lot more people should buy it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,pcar8, 10/26/2011,1st Mitsubishi SUV- Loving it!,4,"I bought a 2011 Silver Outlander a couple months ago. This is my first 'crossover' SUV. My old car was a Nissan Maxima (I've owed 2 of them) now I'm driving a Mitsubishi and absolutley love it! It is so comfortable inside and fun to drive with its fast acceleration, responsive handling and sleek design - I got more bang for my buck! Never thought a navigation system was worth it but boy was I wrong. Plus the 10gb of space on the music server really is a plus. No more dragging around CD's. I just load a CD, record it and I'm good to go on any long distance journey. Oh and the sound system is AWESOME. Did I tell you I love this SUV?"
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,gski1, 04/13/2011,No brainer,5,"I love being on the road and not seeing my car everywhere (had an accord yrs ago and hated that). Even better is that I think everyone in those ""other"" over marketed cars simply made an uneducated buying choice! The Oultander, IMO, wins in style, value, features, reliability and most importantly warranty to boot. 5yr 60K mile bumper to bumper is a great idea. It always bothered my when I bought Honda and Subaru that you'd still be paying for the car with 2yrs payments left! Of course those dealers said ""it's a Honda, you don't need a warranty""...Right, car dealers always tell the truth! If you go for the CRV, I'll be next to you at the light thinking ""you dope""...LOL."
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,tapachick, 06/01/2011,"Great value, great vehicle!!",4,"I researched small/mid-size suv's for months.
I test drove Honda's, Toyota's, Chevy's, Ford's, Mazda's and for some reason, the Outlander was the last vehicle we looked at. I don't think Mitsubishi promotes this vehicle enough. But... we fell in love with the estimated MPG, body style, and most of all, the price.
My 6'4"" husband loves the head room and comfortable seating. It handles great and I'm getting 22 mpg in city driving in Southern California.
You can't beat the warranty and I expect the MPG to get better since I've only had the vehicle for 4 weeks. Great value and a great looking SUV, we're loving it."
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,benneva, 04/06/2011,Not a cookie cutter SUV,4,"I have been looking for a new SUV for a year. When I went to the grocery I would see 2 more vehicles just like my 06 Honda CRV and in the same color. The Outlander is not a CRV or RAV4 and that is a good thing. I test drove Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and Hyundai. I traded my 06 Honda CRV for this car. The Outlander is sportier, has better seats, and it is fun to drive.
I am really happy with my decision. "
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,Alison, 07/18/2018,Prepare to replace an $8K trans at low mileage,2,"I bought this car 3 years ago. I would have really loved it if there weren't so many problems that have plagued me since the day I drove it off the lot. Most of them, on their own, wouldn't be a big deal. But when they all pile up on top of each other, it made for a really stressful car-owning experience. I bought it used in 2015 and was very excited about it. Good things: lots of cargo space, handles amazing in the snow (the 2WD to 4WD option was one of my favorite features) decent gas mileage for the size, fantastic Bluetooth connectivity, comfortable, good visibility for a 5'0"" tall girl. Bad things: (1) The check engine light came on the day after I purchased it (turns out the fuel pump was cracked and the Mistubishi dealer either didn't notice or didn't care), and basically has been on since, even though I've thrown over $1000 at different fixes. After two years, I just started ignoring it. (2) The vents for A/C and heat aren't properly controlled by the knob on the dash. I have to sit there and turn the knob back and forth until the car decides it wants to send the air out of the vents I want it to come out of.  (3) the headlights don't feel very powerful - I honestly can't even tell they're on unless I'm on an unlit road by myself. (4) Most recently (AND MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!) the transmission failed at 120K miles for absolutely no reason. It was fine one night and broken the next morning. Wouldn't shift or go over 55 mph and didn't feel safe to drive. Took it to a trans shop and they said it had failed for no discernible reason, and that it had to be replaced with a brand new OEM transmission from the dealer. It has a very specialized CVT that Mistubishi doesn't seem to allow remanufactured versions of. So I either need to pay $8K to fix a car that's worth less than $6K, or scrap the car and lose all the value of it plus what I still owe on it. I called Mitsubishi and they said it's out of warranty so there is nothing they can do and it just has to be an out-of-pocket expense. I found out afterward that it's not an isolated incident other people have experienced the same thing. Very poor customer service, and I will not be buying another Mistubishi.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,gtrallyracer, 01/09/2012,BEST JAPANESE SUV,5,"I purchased a GT without sunroof and navigation on August 2011. I purchased this great SUV for its reliability reputation, awesome S-AWC system, great ergonomics and powerful V6 engine. I have owned American, Japanese, and German brands, but this time Mitsubishi is offering excellent warranty and standard features to its vehicles.
I have driven already 4000 miles and fuel economy is great for this size of SUV averaging 23mpg.

We almost walked away because we were not thrilled with the White or the Black color options until I spotted one on the showroom floor that had been ordered but not purchased last minute.

The only car I've owned that was worse than this one was a 1986 Bimmer. I can't speak for the other trim versions, but the SE is complete garbage. The car had about 35k miles on it when we purchased it. It now has almost 200k and it's been a very painful journey getting this far. I'll start with the good points which aren't many: • it handles beautifully in the snow, • it has pretty good cargo space, • the third row seating is very handy, • attractive body design. Now for a list of all of the bad (repairs the car has needed within 5 years): • front wheel bearing needed to be replaced, • wiper motor died and had to be replaced, • climate control blower motor died and had to be replaced, • radio and bluetooth controls on steering wheel stopped working, • A/C has a persistent leak, • outer tie rod ends had to be replaced, • exhaust started to leak near the downpipe, • rear differential skips and causes the car to jerk badly at times when making a turn, • front end starts to vibrate and make a clanging noise at low RPMs at times, • one rear brake caliper seized and needed to be replaced, • vehicle staggers in traffic if the gas pedal is pushed down too quickly, • the car now burns through about a quart of oil a week and vibrates horrifically at red lights. Needless to say, we're ready to part ways with this vehicle now. Many people may say that you would expect problems going into 200k miles, but I have a 2007 Eclipse that has not had many of these problems and continues to be one of the best cars I've ever owned. It's also approaching the 200k mile mark. It still runs solid and seldomly gives me any problems. The 2011 Outlander SE has been the sole factor in my decision to part ways with Mitsubishi. At one time Mitsubishi made some of my favorite vehicles. It's a shame what the vehicle division of the company has become.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,cyndietx, 05/19/2012,Mitsubishi Sucks,2,"I bought a 2011 Mitsubishi outlander SE FWD grey in color in 09/2011. I have had nothing but problems! 1st the sunroof popped out of it sitting in the garage!!Mitsubishi 1st gave me the run around, and after much debate, they paid for it. Then a stress crack in the windshield. I paid for it myself because I got NOWHERE w/ mitsubishi. It runs terrible, I have to be careful getting out on the highway or I will get run over. the dealership says nothing is wrong w/ it! I can smell burning rubber, and so can everyone else! They say nothing is wrong! Now the PAINT is comming off!! Mitsubishi says its MY fault....driving conditions??? The running light FELL out going down the road,and low MPGs!!! "
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,Dana, 09/26/2018,Loved my car until transmission fail without warni,2,"I brought my 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander in 2015. It has been serviced to the owners manual. What the owner manual does not tell you is that CVT transmission oil has to be changed every 30,000 miles. Even when I went for my recalls back in May 2018 and also had service done at a Mitsubishi deal at the same time. Not once did they say the transmission fluid had to be changed. So, now today I am out of a car. No warning lights came on. My husband came to a stop for a red light and the car did not want to go up a little hill. And I mean little. I live in South Jersey. We did not have hills here. Please be very careful buying a Mitsubishi. Their transmission are very expensive and rebuilds do not have good reviews. If this was 2 days ago. I would I said I love this car so much. Hell, I was planing on keeping it a few more years. The back door is great for older dogs.

Just got an emailing asking what I think about this car today! (3/26/2020. I hate Mitsubishi's.. Will never buy one again. I gave this car away 11/18 and brought something new. We could not find a transmission for the Mitsubishi. Think twice before buying one.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,ldriver, 08/15/2011,"1st Mitsubishi, 1st 4-cylinder...won't be my last",4,"With only a few thousand miles on the Outlander so far, I'm extremely happy with the purchase. Based on professional tests, user reviews, historical reliability, and my own test drives, the Outlander was my by far my favorite. It looks tougher than the soccer mom CR-V and costs much less than the RAV4. The warranty is excellent but hopefully I won't have to use it.

The Outlander rides smooth and quiet. With the 4 cylinder I'm getting about 25 MPG around the city. I was worried about buying my first 4 cylinder but it does great on the highway and uphill. It is slow off the line but the 6 speed trans makes up for it when passing and climbing."
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,matthew H, 07/12/2017,BUYERS BEWARE!!!,1,"My wife and I purchased a brand new 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander, 2.4L automatic, with AWD. We bought it in 2012. Has been a good car until last week. 7/5/17 at 133k miles the transmission went completely out. Stranded wife and 2 kids on I-70. Towed it to a local transmission place. Come to find out this transmission is like finding a needle in a hay stack. Owner of transmission shop told me it is year specific, model specific, sub-model specific, engine specific, and drive train specific. He actually found 1 brand new transmission in his US wide search, but to buy it, have it shipped, and installed will cost us almost $10k....the vehicle is only worth around $7k. You do the math, plus we still owe money against it lol. Called Mitsubishi Corporate to give them my opinion of the matter. Nothing...sorry about your luck. Wow! I even said well i guess me, my wife, my children, my grandchildren, my family, and friends, and co-workers, and everyone I know on social media won't ever buy another Mitsubishi again, the guy from corporate said, sorry to lose your business. lol, i was like...mic-drop jaw open. Not once did Mitsubishi Corporate offer any assistance or try to help me find a replacement transmission, or offer any options for us to persue. Pretty sad to spend $31k on a vehicle that cant last the length of the loan to pay it off...plus we are paying it off in 3 months, 9 months earlier than the note.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,internetguy, 03/11/2013,One of the best SUV's you can buy!,4,"My girlfriend recently traded in her 2009 Lancer GT for a 2011 Outlander 4cyl AWD. Her Lancer was such a great car and Mitsubishi service is always fantastic. We recently moved into an area where we need a 4x4 so after looking at offerings from Hyundai, Nissan, Jeep, etc. we easily decided on the Outlander!

We chose the 4cyl because we did the not need the power or fuel consumption of the V6. So far we are averaging reviewed specs of 23mpg city and 28mpg highway which is great for a vehicle this size!

Please be aware that the 4cyl is for fuel savings and V6 is for power and towing. Choose wisely as some people seem disappointed by the lack of 4cyl power (168hp). Know what you are buying!"
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,georgechi, 04/25/2011,4WD Gas saver lot of fun,5,"Great gas saver, lot of gadgets (bluetooth, handsfree, satellite radio). 5 speed manual gearbox when I need it, nobody else has it. 4WD real not a ""awd"". Best car I have owned and the best warranty. great power for a 4 cylinder car. Looks great out and inside. third row when I need it. everything on this car is great.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,roj, 08/27/2016,AWESOME SUV,5,"I usually don't like to write reviews, but I see so many negative reviews about Outlander.  I had the car for 5 years now, it has some flaws like road noise and little jerk while you breaking going over 80 miles per/h. Besides that, it is a great SUV, its a beast on snow.(believe me I battle test this on several snow storms in northeast) great handling and reliable.  Well made SUV, don't let the reviews fool you, it's coming from an owner also I'm going to buy 2016 model.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,1lemon, 10/10/2013,Horrible No Confidence,3,"If you need a car to get to work and family this is not the car. Continued electronic failures which prohibit the car from starting will cost you money and time. Wait an hour and try again until the next work day and a trip to the car rental. Beware the Outlander is a bad deal. The feeling of no confidence overtakes you when you attempt to start the vehicle and nothing happens, and let me tell you it is not a good feeling everyday after work to go through that. If you have kids and need to get home too,
this auto may not be the best option."
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,ironvet, 05/27/2014,First SUV after 2-doors coupe',4,"Bought it second hand after arriving in Dubai. It is a small one compared to the others going around here. Very nimble driving at speed, but CVT transmission should be more responsive.
Very comfortable and often we use it in place of the big Mitsubishi Montero we also have.
The Outlander drives and feels like a car and I get most times 27mpg (highway) although mpg is not an issue here."
mitsubishi,outlander,2011,isophorone, 04/20/2013,"So Far, So Good",4,"UPDATE June 2020
The car has 112K miles on it and still runs strong.  The new spark plugs I put in at 100K give the car more power.  It is definitely noisier than our RAV4, though.  Fuel economy is still good, and there have been no oil or other fluid leaks.  The radio still works!  We maintain the car religiously.  I don't know who thinks that the manual says nothing about changing the CVT fluid, but I certainly saw that maintenance item listed.  I go to the dealership for that, but I find it easy to do other things like change the oil.

The main quibbles are that plastic pieces inside the cabin have broken, and we are prone to electric shock in the winter.  The car body definitely feels tinny.  The only non-recall item we had to replace was a CV boot at 90K miles.  The dealership to which we went did a faulty job (under warranty) and we got an independent mechanic to replace the same CV boot again because it was out of warranty by that time.

There are still few dealerships near us.  We plan to run the car into the ground, or keep it at least three more years.  It's sure easy to pick out in a parking lot!
======================================================================

We bought this Outlander new in late 2011 to replace a Saturn Wagon that was burning oil (and that we were outgrowing). 

Right now we have around 23,000 miles on the car.
It starts and runs well.
Since we are used to small engine cars this has enough power for our needs.
The trunk is huge, and the radio sounds great.
Seats are comfortable.
Handling is superb.
We get around 23 mpg overall in winter and 25-26 mpg in summer (suburban driving).
Highway mpg is 28-30 mpg.

The CVT is a bit growly and low speeds and RPM, but once the car is moving it is fine.

mitsubishi,outlander,2011,Blake, 06/08/2020,It does what it do as it should be,4,"I test drove this when it was released, as high school student I can not afford so I waited until I purchased  used 2011 Outlander 2.4L 4WD in 2015 at 74,000km (46k miles) for $14,000 CAD ($10,500 USD). So good deal and I paid it off in 2018. No mechanical trouble, expect CV axle was leaking in 2016 and was replaced under warranty and that was it. Currently at 170,000km (105k miles) and rolling. I love this thing as I'm 6'6"" and it comforts me and cargo size is amazing. If you take rear seats out, I can sleep in on a long road trip and numerous times I take headrest off, flip front passenger seat all the down to level the back seat to lay and sleep. I live in Canada with heavy winter condition and it is very reliable during these freezing time as handling is wonderful. I'm regilous in upkeeping maintenance and do these myself as it's not hard to do. Things I've replaced so far;
Brake rotors and pads
Outer tie rods
Rear struts
Muffler

Side note; I do off roadings so I basically abuse it a bit. Maybe a bit much of fun. I bottomed out the muffler so hence why the replacement. Outer tie rods was replaced just few hundred km ago when it became loose from tear/wear in my time out in the wild roads. Rear struts, on other note, I was in Manitoba with 3 passengers and a full cargo with suitcases/stuff. I crossed one of poorly designed train crossing, so bumpy enough to bounce my SUV up in the air and lost all strength in rear struts from all the impact and weight. It was just sitting lower in the back after taking stuff out with no passenger. 

It is a great starter ""newer"" vehicle for me to purchase this when I was 20 years old. Planning on keep it long as I could. Heard about CVT nightmare stories, I called my local dealership for a quote on CVT replacement just out of curiosity and was blew away with $12,000 CAD ($9k USD) bill.  Overall it's a really strong and reliable vehicle out of all vehicles I owned! I get lot of compliments about my vehicle, it look darn good!

mitsubishi,outlander,2012,Mike M, 10/28/2015,"Nothing fancy, but a serious bang for your buck!",4,"I have owned this vehicle for 4 years now, and have 88,000 TROUBLE FREE miles.  Never a day in the shop (outside of regular service intervals, oil changes, etc).  It is loud on the highway, the cabin is far from quiet.  It now has an exhaust leak somewhere, making it a little louder.  But the structural integrity is good.  It steers well, not sloppy, and offers excellent visibility.  The ability to switch between 2WD, intelligent AWD, or full time 4 wheel drive is very nice, and the transition between each is seamless (so far, I like this AWD even better than my old Subaru and Audi A4 Quattro).  Yes, its underpowered and is not going to rocket you anywhere (0-60, quarter mile, etc).  I used to get back and forth between Buffalo and Cleveland in the winter just fine (while others are careening off the road, I am going highway speeds with the Rockford Fosgate punched up high).  The cabin is comfortable, the cargo space is very good, and the feature bundle is pretty fair.  The windows are no longer aligned perfectly going up and down, but they work just fine.  The technology is simple, not great, but all the comforts and conveniences you need.  Its not a remarkable vehicle, its just a TREMENDOUS value - safe, reliable, roomy, great MPG, and low cost of ownership.  Still no signs of rust!

mitsubishi,outlander,2012,ron84, 12/21/2012,2012 Mitsubishi Outlander GT,4,"Just bought my son his second Mitsubishi Outlander (2012 Outlander GT AWD). We bought him a 2007 Outlander LS 5 years ago and it has been bullett proof. No issues at all.
We bought the 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander GT 2 months ago and thus far I have been very impressed. Although it is the same generation as his 2007 it has numerous improvements and has not dissapointed thus far.
The 2007 had a slight hesitation when taking off but the 2012 does not have the same hesitation and is very smooth on takeoff.
It is rated 10 HP higher than the 2007 and like the 2007 is very quick (and economical).
Very fun to drive."
mitsubishi,outlander,2012,K, 07/11/2018,So many better cars,2,"Took my Outlander to several several shops to get multiple opinions after the transmission started slipping. The going consensus is that the type of transmission this car has, a CVT, isn't possible to just fix. I have been told that this year in particular was one of the first years that this type of transmission was built so it's very problematic and buggy. My car is at 116k miles. The manual says to change the transmission oil at 120k. Aside from this issue, before the problems started there were many things I wished I'd noticed. The back seat folds down strangely where the seats fold up rather than down. If you're a camper like me and appreciate having the option to sleep in your car, you won't be able to do that in this car. I'm 5'4 and had to curl up my pegs to fit. Also, this car doesn't do hills very well, you can hear it really working. And add using the air conditioning, it really slows down the car. The best thing about it is the sound system, roof rack and back up camera. I wouldn't recommend buying this car though. Regular shops don't appear to work on these much and dealerships aren't that common.

mitsubishi,outlander,2012,ohiodoug, 07/27/2014,Pretty solid,4,"I bought this car at the very end of 2012 after my previous car was totaled and I had to make a decision pretty quick.
I really hadn't thought of a CUV, but this was advertised right at 19K as a leftover 2012.
I really liked to storage and room in the front and rear, and the ride seemed comfortable.
Overall a much better value than just a sedan for someone who needs to haul stuff from time to time. So far (19 months in) the reliability has been excellent.
No problems at all!
Fuel economy is about as advertised 23/28, with better city mileage than that under some circumstances.
However, if your highway speeds get up much above 70mph, the economy seems to drop off sharply.

Very suprised by the responsiveness of the 4 with the CVT.
Don't miss the 6 cyl!

It has everything I wanted in it, handles well, very nice sound system.
Plenty of features and a great warranty.

Both have 4wd systems. The value is very good, that was by far the best lease deal on any suv we could find, and they also gave us the best deal on our trade-ins we could find anywhere.

We liked the overall appearance, features and the test drive experience of both cars.

the fact that in one of them there are 7 seats, and it is a full 4wd makes it already quite unique.

Everything is good and fun about these cars, but 3 important areas: fuel economy is way below the advertised, especially in the city. Cheap, easily stainable/scratchable plastic used. CVT transmission is noisy and slow to react."
mitsubishi,outlander,2012,germanwolf41, 09/04/2013,CVT sucks,3,"My CVT transmission seized at 137,500 miles.
NO mention to change the fluid in the owners manual, just check fluid every 30k miles.
Mitsubishi also fails to tell you they expect you to have the MIVEC motor valves to be adjusted every 30k miles (a $400-ish job)
Due to limited Mitsubishi dealers I'd advise against buying any Mitsubishi.
Also, the CVT fluid is $19.50 per quart, 6qt roughly to change fluid once.
The ONLY place you can get the Diaqueen J4 tranny fluid IS at Mitsubishi.
NOT worth the hassle.
Odd size for the 18"" wheels, hard to find & expensive to replace tires. Only 4 choices"

You can do 30 MPG on the highway at 65-70mph, but I don't drive there often.

Not only did the it meet those requirements, but I got so much more. Initially, I was bothered because I rarely see an Outlander on the road, thinking it must be a bad car, nobody wants it; Have I made a mistake??? No regrets! I now say that it is a well-kept secret, because this car is a real gem!!! I love all the unexpected bells/whistles and sleek body style. I like cars that don't age quickly, like my old Jeep Liberty (had it 10 years and it still looks as good as anything else on the road).

Bells and whistles usually found on much more expensive cars/add on packages. V6 engine is a great compromise of being plenty powerful but still fuel efficient. AWD (not a cut down version like other cars, active torque vectoring), high end features that really make a difference in safety and comfort (e.g. automatic wiper, automatic HID lights, super large outside mirrors, backup camera, dual zone AC, keyless entry and start). 100% reliable to this date and I'm confident it will handle pretty much anything with ease, passengers, heavy cargo, towing, and challenging weather conditions. Fun to drive thanks to solid road feel, very spacious interior and virtually no blind spots. Since owning it, had a couple of long distance road trips with heavily loaded car or trailer. Pleasure to drive, much less tiring than with previous car and super easy to pass, even with load. Major complaint is lower back clearance in back with load. AWD was great with boat trailer, especially on curvy road.

I can't wean myself from Japanese cars. I shopped between the Santa Fe, Rogue 2014 and the Outlander 2014. Being a current Nissan and Mitsubishi owner, it was a hard decision between the Rogue and the Outlander. The current MPG averages 28-30 combined.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,sierram, 10/28/2013,A great small crossover suv,4,"Do not trust the reviewers. This vehicle deserves to be test driven. The material quality is fantastic inside. Mitsubishi did not cheap out and use tons of hard plastic like the rest of the competition. I think the exterior looks classy and is similar to the Land Rover Range Rover or 1st gen Cayanne. The 3rd row is usable because the second row can be moved up without losing that much legroom. I'm 5'5"" and I was able to sit in the 3rd row. I wouldn't want to sit there for long trips but it should be fine for my needs around town. I can't wait to try out the 4wd on the snow.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,foxwagen, 05/30/2014,L.O.V.E.,4,"Just picked up a 2014 Outlander SE AWD with the Touring package today.
I am in love with this car.
It could use a bit more power.
But, honestly, the power is more than adequate, I think I'm just gluttonous.


The exterior is more gorgeous in pictures than you can see online, and the interior is very well-crafted and classically designed - modern without being trendy.

For the price, the features and quality can't be beat.

Oh, and the 710 watt Rockford Fosgate stereo?
Ummm...insane."
mitsubishi,outlander,2014,Trace, 08/17/2016,Outlander ES Base 4 cyl,5,"This is an awesome vehicle for the the money.  Let me see I could have bought a Nissan Versa Note or a 7 passenger Outlander.  Our has been great with the exception of being rear-ended six weeks into ownership.  The OEM tires are junk, but the value provided by this vehicle is extraordinary.  We paid $19,300 BRAND NEW including TAX and fees in FL.  We can haul 7 people when necessary, and average 28MPG @70mph on trips.  I have seen as high as 31MPG in town.

Update: Vehicle was great but did not survive a large oak tree falling on it in Jan of 2017.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,ontarioman, 06/19/2013,Great Buy,4,"Overall, Nice vehicle. Nice handling in city and has decent power with the V6. Very fast pick up on the highway. The V6 makes a nice growl when accelerating. Handles rough pavement like a charm. Good fuel consumption for a v6. It is about the same as my 4 cylinder rav4. Very good brake feel.
Very nice well laid out dash. Out of all the vehicles i tested drove, The forester xt, mazda cx-5 and the outlander GT was in the running. The forester seat was not supportive and the steering was too loose. The mazda was very good and my wife has one. I think the handling is slightly better than the outlander but
the powe of the outlander cannot be beaten . The Super allweel drive system is legendary."
mitsubishi,outlander,2014,Laurel, 12/11/2017,"Thought it would be forever, nope, 4 years.",3,"Purchased brand new. Right after hitting 35k miles (about 2.5 years in), backup camera goes out. Talk to service at dealer, if it was just a fuse, it would still be covered. I'd have to pay an $89 diagnostic fee (wasn't a top priority as the backup sensors still worked). After hitting 40/45k miles, my radio speakers just cut out completely on a road trip. Next day they worked. Next week, the Bluetooth kept randomly going into call mode, it wasn't calling anyone, I wasn't calling anyone. I restarted the car several times at stop lights, same situation happened. Decided to take it to service for diagnostics. Whomp, whomp, it was the ENTIRE RADIO SYSTEM. It would cost about $1200 with labor to replace the radio (& that's without NAV). Figured I'd deal with it until it truly went kaput. Hit 55k miles & the compressor for A/C started making Darth Vader noises & A/C went out on, of course, a hot day, plus, I had a guest riding with me all day to my accounts for work (A/C warranty, amongst most others, runs out at 60k). I made an appointment ASAP! Compressor was leaking so I got a new one that day (they had them on hand as they said they have been having issues with them). I have been juggling with the idea of trading in before it depreciates in value even more from me packing miles on it for work (avg. 5k every 2 months) or buying an extended warranty for around $1,500 which would allow me to get a new radio (hopefully the Bluetooth would be smoother on that one) & I would have a backup camera again after a year without. 1st owner, would hit 4 years in May of 2018 if I keep it that long. I'm worried I'll be 2 hours away from home & the Keyless Push to Start won't work next. Great PRO is that Mitsubishi is the only company with a 100k mile Powertrain Warranty. Also, I get amazing gas mileage for a 3rd row SUV. That's where I struggle with my decision.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,Edbeasly, 04/27/2019,Look for something else,2,"I think this car provides a smooth ride over all. There are two major gripes I have about it. I don't feel safe in it when making turns. It loses traction no matter the terrain or weather conditions. I can't drive over 20 mph and make a turn without feeling like it might flip over. The other issue is the A/C. The compressor went out on it two years after I bought it. It went out again recently. I am told the issue is due to bad design. Oh, and while I'm here, I think the issue with any Mitsubishi is that they hold no value. Whether that is warranted or not, I don't know. Based on my experience, I wouldn't buy one again and would recommend others to look for something else.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,Omar, 08/21/2019,"Ok Suv, blehh",4,"I own a 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander ES model. I am the second owner and I bought it with 24,000 miles. What I like about this SUV is that you rarely see them where I live in the Palm Springs area so I took a chance and bought one. Everything was great in the beginning but the more I drove the car I started to see little things here and there and why the price was so low overall in all Mitsubishi vehicles. There is little to no soundproofing on most of the truck so I had to install some for a quieter ride. Also the model I bought came with those ugly steel rims so I purchased some lighter rims at my local tire shop and it seems to get better gas mileage, even though the gas mileage is okay or I can say good considering the size of a suv. Now at 79000 Miles I haven't had any issues with the car I've only done oil changes regular maintenance checkups but one thing that I did notice is that during our summers here of 120 or so these models always make a squealing sound when accelerating. I even went to the dealership and bought the pulleys and items to be replaced (500$)It stopped for a week or so but this heat makes them squeal like pigs LOL randomly the good part. If you're not into cars that much this is a great car for you or if you have kids and you know they are going to mess up your car this is a great buy. And if you are avoiding a minivan this is a good buy.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,Mike V., 09/06/2018,You get more than what you paid for,5,"I had the base model with the full upgrade package with the Fosgate Stereo and the 7-seater. Some may look at this as an average vehicle but personally I used to hate buying a car and all the accessories fall apart and the handles falling off the doors and the stereo systems not being very well and seats covers cracking. I have to say the Mitsubishi uses the best parts for the interior of the car because none of them ever fall off or fall apart and the seat covers look like new when we handle the car back in. The Fosgate stereo system with the bass booster was just awesome and it really didn't cost that much more to get the extra accessories when you actually see what you get. All-wheel drive would have been wonderful but the car handle pretty well in bad weather. The one thing that I agree with is the two seats in the back we're kind of useless facing forward. They should have had it designed so that the seats would be facing looking backwards so that you had good leg room. I just took out one of the seats and made extra storage cargo. It was fine for my needs and my family. Overall, this is the really the best bang for your buck at a great quality level. The tires that the car came with lasted 50,000 miles easy. The four cylinder engine also seem to hold up very well. We put about a hundred thousand miles on the car and never once had a major repair except one recall on the emergency brake cable. No cost to us. I love the Outlander series. As we speak I'm shopping for another one now.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,austintech, 02/05/2014,2014 Mitsubishi Outlander SE Great Value,4,"When you compare any vehicle priced under $25k that comes with 5/60 bumper to bumper warranty, 10/100k power train warranty, comes with back up camera, heated seats, bluetooth, roominess and 26 mpg combined, there aren't many that can compare. With the 2014 Outlander SE, you get all this and reliability of Mitsubishi. Yes, it's not a sports car. Yes, it doesn't have cutting edge design. Unlike other vehicles in its class, it's very quiet, is comfortable, handles reasonably well, and has all the safety features you'd expect for lots more. We researched lots of vehicles for what we needed and couldn't come up with a better solution for the money.

mitsubishi,outlander,2014,tr2v3l3r, 03/04/2014,2014 Mitsubishi Outlander GT,3,"I test drove several Mitsubishi cars and liked the way the car felt.
After driving the car for a week I was able to find a number of short comings.
The automatic transmission is unresponsive, traction control never engages in slippery conditions, loud road noise, and the car itself feels unrefined.
V6 engine has 224 hp at 6250 rpm, but power to weight ratio is 0.045 hp/lb.
The car is a bit too heavy at 5005 pounds.
My previous car was lighter at 4001 pounds and you can feel the difference.
This is my first Mitsubishi car, but I have been looking at them for 15 years.
A number of my friends owned Mitsubishi cars and were happy with them."

Doors are really light, back gate doesn't always open, a # of features are stripped out in the SE so some things you would expect aren't included. Bluetooth doesn't always work so I make a call, they hear me but I don't know it's even connected. Wipers spray over the windshield/crooked. Remote start is a joke, need to start again when in car. The only comfortable spot for the steering wheel will block your dash. Two days after leasing, had major mechanical issue. Second lease payment they didn't notify me of automatic payments starting so I made a payment and then they pulled as well,

In my experience, this car is well below average reliability. 
The vehicle is also underpowered. Mine has the 2.4L and if you have 3 adults, you might want to throw out some weight out the window. It is such a dog with 3 adults. In addition the 3rd row is a joke. Picture someone sitting on a paint can and bent over to avoid hitting your head on the roof.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Jesse Coley, 07/24/2015,Honest Little Family Car,4,"*Revised July 2019*
Condensed, edited, and simplified;
Purchased new for several thousand less than MSRP and driven hard for past four years on numerous road trips across the southern and central United States with multiple adults and multiple children.
Reliable: Stuff works and it always works, only been to dealership for safety recall on parking brake and standard maintenance stuff except for a weird thing that happened early on where a police lidar gun ""confused"" the keyless ignition (long story, dealership couldn't find anything wrong but suspected the cop had the gun set too ""hot""); 
AC: Mitsubishi makes automotive HVAC systems for OEM market, so you get top shelf stuff here at a discount; 
Fuel Mileage: Mid-twentys MPG around town, over 30mpg if you keep it under 70mph on the highway, but 26mpg at 80 is pretty good too;
Transmission: CVT is probably one of the best on the market- It is programmed to do what CVTs do best and that's keep the engine in the ""sweet spot"" (and not pretend it's a regular automatic which defeats the whole purpose), the droning noise can be annoying, the ""sport"" setting is useful for engine braking (the manual even recommends it!);
Engine: 2.4 liter long stroke four cylinder is typical Mitsubishi style powerplant- kinda noisy, paired well with transmission, loves to rev high, can cruise at 80mph all day long, plenty of torque for hills;
Tires: OEM tires are made for fuel mileage and nothing else, upgraded to Yokohamas around 30,000 miles and car handles and rides like a dream;
Stereo: Base stereo sounds great, not sure the Rockford Fosgate upgrade would bring much more to the table other than a subwoofer;
Styling: 2015 was best year in my opinion, I don't like the styling for 2016 and later;
Suspension: Tough! Potholes? This thing eats potholes (and curbs) for breakfast! Comfortable ride, too;
Interior: Seats four medium adults comfortably with two children and optionally a third child in middle row center seat in a pinch, seat fabric is durable and easy to clean, front seats are very comfortable for long trips, third row is easy to access and fold away, hidden storage compartments abound;
Exterior: Orange (copper) paint looks great but it is thin! Chips and scratches come easily, but I've come to accept it, besides- it adds ""character"";
Summary: This car is unapologetically Japanese. Not only was it made in Japan, but it was made for Japan. This is not a Toyota Highlander wannabe, it's not even a RAV4 wannabe, this is an OUTLANDER and I think its pretty cool. If you need a family car that can do a little bit of everything and take a beating, this is it.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,1sttimemitsubi, 03/27/2015,"Best CUV Value in it's class, hands down-Should have its own class.",4,"For the money, you can't beat the SE premium package.  What CUV has 3 rows of leather seats (yes the third is smaller but how often do you have 7 people in your car), moon roof, Harmon K. sound system with sub, heated seats, motorized rear hatch, 31mpg hwy, etc for less than $25k. Overall we could not be happier with our purchase.  Two minor areas they can fix, front passenger leg room, just a little more, and automatic running lights and headlamps.  This should not be compared to the larger 3 row SUVs.  This is a CUV+ comparable to the Rogue(no leather available w 3 rows).  The new 2015 design looks way better and they got rid of that horrible grill from the 2014's."
mitsubishi,outlander,2015,John, 10/25/2015,Awesomeness on 4 wheels,5,"I normally would never have purchased a Mitsubishi anything but, while in Europe for work, I rented this model on 2 separate occasions.  The first occasion was for a drive from Germany to Italy (11 hours from where I was).  The car handled great, was very comfortable and roomy enough (I'm 6'7""), and the fuel economy really impressed me. The second occasion was to travel across Germany from the most western part to Berlin (7 hrs with traffic/road construction). There were 4 of us and we thoroughly enjoyed the comfort, size and the easy transition from highway to driving into the heart of the city. When it was time to buy a new vehicle I had absolutely no doubts as to what I wanted. I'm impressed with the V6 power and I like the ability to choose what type of driving performance at the touch of a button. With the AWD I don't worry about any sudden weather changes in winter or rainy season.
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2015,mt, 10/06/2015,I like it.,4,"I wasn't in the market for a car.  Was looking for something for a 3rd row for my sister.  The Outlander GT caught my attention because I really liked its lines.  This car is like a big station wagon with some ground clearance.  I'll never use the 3rd row seat, but I have a great amount of space in the back with the third row folded down.  There is also lots of space for passengers in the rear seat.  Just had adult friends sitting in the back, and they had at least a few inches of space between their knees and the front seats.  

I just drove it from Philly to Cape Cod and back, and it was a very nice ride.  Back wasn't sore, plenty of power to pass, and no complaints from adults in the back seat.  Also had plenty of room for luggage in the back.  Only thing I noticed was that if you have to floor it to get our of a hairy situation, the engine is really loud.  That happened a couple times, but overall, cruising in the left lane and merging on to the highways was done easily and quietly.  I'll never use the paddle shifters, so I can't write anything about them.  Visibility is great.  It really feels like a station wagon inside, which I like.  It drives more like a truck, which I also like.  It reminds me of Jeeps and pick-ups that I've owned in the past.  It's probably less carlike than its competitors.

The audio system is great.  I have to take the time to read the manuals to figure some stuff out, which I'll probably never do.  I hope there are some overrides so I can make some changes to music or nav system while driving.  A passenger was trying to do some stuff that could not be done if I wasn't in park.  An Iphone was also unable to configure with the audio system while I was driving.  

I love the power lift-gate that can be operated with the remote.  Also like the push-button start, and being able to lock/unlock doors without taking key out of my packet.  

I've seen reviews that say the interior looks cheap, but it looks ok to me.  The fake wood is minimal, and the vented leather on the seats looks great.  I do hate putting premium fuel in it, but I drive less than most people, so that didn't bother me too much.  I got the car used.  It was a dealer demo, and I got a really good deal on it.  I would never pay the MSRP for it, but for what I payed, I think it's a great car/truck...whatever it is.  Hope to have it for a long time.  Going to add a remote starter, and then I'm happy as a clam.  The 2016 has the power fold in mirrors.  I miss having that feature.

April, 2017 update.  
I've put about 15k miles on car, and I still like it a lot.  Don't love it though.  Only complaints are that there is noticeable wind noise on the highway, and it takes big bumps pretty hard, especially the rear wheels.  Other than that, no complaints from me.  Car has plenty of space and it's very comfortable.  With seats folded flat I can jam in 15 - 20 bags of mulch.  I love the stereo, and that solves the wind noise problem for me.  Back seat passengers have great space.  I never use the 3rd row, so there is a ton of space in the cargo area.  I have the white exterior with light tan leather, and I think it looks great.  Maybe kind of soccer mommish, but I like how bright it is.  I got a comment the other day that it still smells like a new car.
I've had no mechanical issues, and twice I've left the interior light on overnight and it still started in the morning.  That really surprised me.
Had one big snow storm this winter, and it got through it like a champ.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Fazzster, 01/12/2017,1.5 years and 28k miles,4,"Being an auto enthusiast and having owned an embarrassingly large number of cars, I knew enough to ignore the so called journalist reviews and check this vehicle out for myself. I like the fact this Mitsu is 100% made and assembled in Japan. The build quality is excellent as a result. There is really no other vehicle for the price that offers a 3rd row and come with all the goodies. A Highlander will cost you nearly $10k more and Rogue only comes in 1 trim if you want the 3rd row. With $5k in Mitsu incentives plus a large dealer discount, this vehicle can be had for very cheap. Plus you get a 100k mile warranty. This is where ""you get what you pay for"" comes in. The engine design is over a decade old so if you care about the latest and greatest, you may not be satisfied. It operates very smooth and efficient in normal driving but when you tap into the power the noise can be obtrusive and is not helped by the nature of the CVT. But to its credit, it still remains relatively smooth under load and delivers excellent MPG. The suspension is a little harsh (which was addressed in the 2016+ models) when handling choppy pavement but otherwise it smooth and quiet on good roads. The AWD system is brilliant and the snow setting is excellent. I run dedicated snows in the winter and the grip and control is very impressive. Interior; the materials are very good and are on par with the class and wear well even with 3 kids. My wife and I are short at 5'3"" and find the seats comfortable with decent adjustability. Our Outlander has been reliable at 28k miles so far with no repairs to report. In short, most people would be pleased with the Outlander. However considering its poor resale value, crappy dealer network, and the competition that  keeps getting better, the Outlander is a value proposition only vehicle. Meaning, if you can't get it for at least $8k off MSRP then you maybe better off with something else. You are still getting stellar Japanese reliability/quality and a vehicle loaded with features that will serve you well for miles to come while leaving cash in your wallet.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Dutch Deblouw, 12/24/2016,Pleasantly surprised !!,5,"we bought this about 4k miles ago with a salvage title, spend about 10k out the door with only 9k miles on it, was a flood vehicle.  they had refurbed it and it still smells and smelled like a new car.  I had test driven a used one with equivalent miles to make sure all was on the up and up and when i picked this one up i fell in love. its the burnt orange color and has the bells and whistles, heated seats, gps, back up cam etc, love it!! solid feel to the car, our previous car was a 2006 mazda 5, so performance wise there wasnt much difference, yes, its a 4 banger and it is not designed to drag race, if i would like in the metroplex i would rather have a v6, but in small town texas a 4 banger is just fine... i routinely get 26-28 mpg when i decide to drive the speed limit, other wise it sits steady at 25mpg which is still better then our much smaller mazda5 did... seats are great, back is small, but thats to expected. love the push start and onboard computer stuff.

UPDATE:

After about 10 months of owning it i must say we still love this car, great gas mileage, good comfort, and we have the bells and whistles so back up camera and gps etc, Gps is cumbersome and we hardly ever use it, phone is easier to us, but, the screen is nice for settings, music info etc.

haven't had a lick of trouble out of it.

Update: about 20k miles later. Still no luck of trouble out of it. Crack in windshield. But that's hardly to blame on the car. I'm not a fan of how the engine sounds. But that's just because I like the sound of a v8. This sounds very little (which it is) 

Very happy with it though

65k update

We decided to get rid of the car. Not because it's bad. But because I found a great deal on a nice Buick envision. 

The only thing on the Outlander that bothered us was perhaps the road noise. And since upgrading to the Buick and me driving a k900. It's clear just how noisy it was. However. It served us well for many years.

The only thing that ever broke on us was a starter. Which was a pain to replace. But. Other then that they car was dependable.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,gladitsgone, 04/17/2018,What are people thinking?,2,"The only rationale I can come up with for people giving good reviews on this car is the sheer embarrassment that they bought it.  I know that's how I felt.  I should have listened to the consumer report review that said the only thing that works well in the car is the AC.  The engine was powerful enough to pull a lawnmower and the sluggishness made this car unsafe to drive on the highway.  The third row seat is pretty much a scam as nobody can fit back there.  I would feel I was endangering children back there as well.  Oh, and the fuel economy in my experience is also BS.  I never got beyond 27mpg and that was five hours on the highway.  Around town it is no better than a highlander or pilot.  The sacrifices are too many not to step up to a real vehicle.....unless you're broke and don't mind driving something this ugly.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Tammy, 12/02/2017,Best Car I've ever bought! Still...after 3 yrs,5,"I love my OUTLANDER!  It's comfortable to ride and drive.  It hasn't got the 'most' power but has all I need.  The 10/100,000 mile warranty was more than I expected but haven't had to use it.  It's only needed routine maintenance in 2 years, oil changes, tire rotations, that's it!  Mine also has a no-rust warranty which is almost unheard of and a great perk for any vehicle being drive in Maine.  Super reliable.  The back seats are all that comfortable but they're not used much anyway.  No kids.  Mileage is average.  The ground clearance is actually what attracted me to this vehicle.  It's more than my previous SUV that kept getting stuck in my driveway when there was a significant snow fall.  I haven't gotten stuck with my Outlander.  Heated seats....just awesome!  There are so many perks to this car, they far outweigh any possible negatives, not that I can think of any.  Truly the best car I've ever had in my 30 years of driving!

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Out backer, 04/25/2020,Lotta bang for your bucks 2015 SE (PREMIUM),5,"Aside from wanting the 4WD system with the V6, I got myself a 2015 Outander with 38k miles - 30k miles later i've only needed to replace wipers, battery, and four tires. Minor things like the low light bulbs have burnt once or twice on my right headlight. It seems to be the windshield has a certain defect after 45k miles. Smooth ride but it can get noise if it's really windy. Word to the wise treat your powerlift gate button nicely in the trunk!! The only downfall to this vehicle (at least in America) is the re-sale value - Black book is currently giving me around 9k on average condition & 1 minor accident in carfax (with specs). Stealership offered me 5G. Maybe it due to the incoming recession.. [non-permissible content removed]

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Dominick Scalcione, 08/25/2016,"Horrific A/C, Cooling; Poor Delivery",1,"Can't recall having these issues with any previous import.  To start with somehow the dealer delivered the car with all four tires over-inflated at 45 PSI pressure.  The SUV was all over the road as you can imagine and had an extremely hard ride over bumps.  Since this was my first car with TPMS, unfortunately I never thought to check the tire pressure.  The TPMS it turns out only monitors for under pressure tires, not over.  As a result I didn't realize there was a problem for 3 months.  On research I learned that some foreign manufacturers over-inflate to guarantee that the tires will not go flat in transit, and it's the dealer's responsibility to set them correctly on delivery.  But I think more likely this dealer prep guy had a brain freeze and over-set the pressure.  I just wonder how many other cars they sent out on the road in this dangerous condition?  

That was the first problem.  The dealer corrected the tire pressure, inspected the chasis and had to reset the wheel alignment.  The 2nd problem, was the odor of coolant around the front of the vehicle when it gets hot.  It could be smelled from up to 15 - 20 feet.  This went on for more than a year.  At this time the odor can be smelled from very close to the front of the car.  

The 3rd problem is the most serious.  When the ambient temperature is 95 or greater, and when the vehicle comes to a stop at a traffic light at idle, the A/C starts blowing HOT air.  At other times when the outside temperature is 85 and after a half hour or more of driving in the midday heat, the same problem occurs, at idle the A/C starts blowing HOT air.  In both cases as soon as vehicle motion starts, A/C is restored.  The dealer has not been able to duplicate the conditions for the A/C failure, so as yet no resolution of this problem.  I called a Mitsubishi dealer in St. Petersburg, Fl. after a hot spell.  They reported no issues with vehicles coming in for this condition.  Finally to be fair I should note that I got a very good price on this vehicle with a 6 year no interest loan from Mitsubishi.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Monique, 12/16/2016,Should have never bought this,2,"Never should have bought this car.  Have had people in Prius' and Smart Cars pass me from a stand still. Worst/Slowest acceleration EVER!!! I would hope that with such slow and strained get up that I would at least get good gas mileage but that was terrible as well.  Right now I'm getting about 20 miles to the gallon.  Some pro are: Interior, Seats, Technology and exterior is nice. But do not but for the 7 seats unless you have two children or ""little people"" riding back there. And once you put up the third row there is NO and I mean NO truck space.  I have a car seat in the second row. Have to keep third row folded down just to fit in average size stroller.  Will not be buying this again
*Update- have since traded it in for something else. Simply put, unless you want an inferior suv that has no guts and does poorly on gas mileage, this is NOT the vehicle for you.

mitsubishi,outlander,2015,Cindy Villarreal, 07/23/2017,Fun Car!,5,"Great car with wonderful styling, quick acceleration when needed, ECO for increased mileage, just fun to drive!   Sleek, modern styling with a great engine and history of low maintenance.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Tom Colosimo, 02/10/2016,Tommy's Red Rider Outlander GT,4,"UPDATE:  Now at 80K miles.  All going well.  Red Rider is still purring along  MPG averaging around 22.5 MPG highway and city.  Using 88/87 and 91 octane gas - all seems the same.  One thing noticed and brought in for checking out; outside push-button lock/unlock button on drivers door continues to be unresponsive at times during hot weather and cold weather.  Took into dealer a couple of times and, of course, it was 'normal'.  At least it is noted in my file for future issues.  I have extended warranty on vehicle until 160K miles.  Otherwise, no issues.

UPDATE:  Now at 63K miles.  All going well.  Just changed transmission and differential fluids as well as an oil change.  Very important since I do towing of my sailboat ongoing during the summer.  The V6 does very well with this work.  Getting around 22 MPG during the summer on average using 88 Octane gas.
Still agree with my purchasing of it 4 years ago as being a good value for the money spent!

UPDATE:  Now at 53.8K miles.  Getting a good taste of its capabilities in deep snow here in the Twin Cities.  Put in LOCK (VS SNOW for whatever reason) and it goes just about anywhere you need to go without any difficulties!  A real machine that seems to like to battle snows!  Otherwise, MPG slips a bit in the winter like with all vehicles.  Getting about 19 MPG around town now vs around 21 or so in the summer.  Still, view this as a great value for what you get in the V6 level vehicle and for maneuvring around in the snows.

UPDATE: Now at 46.6K miles.  Still enjoying this vehicle.  Tows my 24-foot sailboat very well up and down a steep ramp.  All features continue to work well as expected.  A bit disappointed with the Blue Tooth hookup for 'voice commands'.  Can't seem to recognize my voice to engage it but am able to work around that.  Wish it had more of the updated safety features such as 'blind spot' and circumference warning when backing up for side approaching cars.  Otherwise, the safety features works well.  Mileage is about 22 to 23 around the city on REGULAR gas!

UPDATE - approaching 40K miles on my red Outlander and still loving it!  MPG's are still the same for combo city/hiway of around 22 MPG.  I have continued to test using Premium gas and Regular and no difference in MPG's or performance that I can tell and I'm pretty anal about my car!  Only thing is that I wish I had some of the features that were added to the 2017 Outlander like; heated steering wheel, blind spot monitoring and backup/cross traffic alert!  Otherwise I love the safety features I have especially the interactive cruise control.  Very good feature that I did not think about when I bought this car!!
Love the sound system and riding comfort.  Still can't understand the terrible reviews on CR and other bases.  Owners seem to LOVE their Mitsubishi's!!

Don't believe everything you read!  The Mitsubishi Outlander is NOT a piece of crap!  I've got 25K miles on mine and love it!  I burn regular unleaded and get an avg. of 23 MPG's!  I've tried a couple tanks of premium and get the same MPG's and performance!  The vehicle is solid in snow traction, acceleration, quietness, steering, etc.  I love the LED headlights and tail lights - you don't get that on a 2016 XLE Rav4!

I did test drive a LOT of 2015 CUV's before I bought this model.  I recently drove a 2016 Rav4 and did not like the bumpy ride, noisy interior, poor acceleration and LACK OF TOWING!  AND the price for a 4 cylinder vs. my V6 was ALMOST the same with the same options I have!!   I think Mitsubishi messed up there marketing and some of their models over the past 10 years or so but this car is NOT bad!  I had a Mazda for 12 years before this and there is no comparison to that vehicle with the smooth shifting 6 speed the Outlander has and power over that Mazda that had a 200 HP V6.  So.....try it out before you buy something else!

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Christian, 10/11/2016,Best Bang for Your Buck,5,"As many others have said, the so-called ""experts"" seem to miss the true appeal of the Outlander -- an AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SAFE, FUEL-EFFICIENT family SUV with a load of features that would easily cost you thousands more elsewhere. We were able to get our 2016 Outlander SEL for $25,000, and that was WITH 0% financing for 72 months. Shop around, and you won't find another SUV in its class that comes even close when you factor in the features Mitsubishi includes as standard with the SEL trim level. So, what do you get for the money? Well, for starters we are routinely getting 31+ mpg on the highway, and up to 36 mpg in some instances. On hilly back roads and in town, you will run pretty close to the 24/25 mpg advertised mileage, which is still fine for a vehicle of this size. In addition to the economy, you're getting a 5-star safety rating, a 5-year/60,000-mile bumper to bumper warranty and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Again, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and all the U.S. auto makers don't even come close on warranty. And if you compare similar vehicles from Hyundai and Kia with the features you are getting from Mitsubishi, the price isn't close. So, on top of the economy, safety and reliability, now you can add a nicely appointed leather interior, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, 6-inch color touch screen entertainment display with integrated Bluetooth for your phone, fog lights, keyless entry, power driver's seat, 18-inch allow wheels, LED brake lights and daytime running lights and more. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the all-wheel drive on the Outlander is a full-featured system that allows you to switch to various modes and even lock the wheels. We haven't had any poor weather yet to truly test the AWD system, but based on other drivers' reviews, I am confident it will serve us well this winter on the mountain roads around our Pennsylvania home. As for the third-row seats, yes, they ARE tiny. You certainly would not want to ride across the country in them. However, I imagine most families are like ours and the third-row seats are not for everyday use but rather for occasional use when the kids have a couple friends along or when grandma and grandpa visit and we want to go out to dinner without the need to drive two vehicles. In such instances, the rear seats are more than adequate and represent a real convenience that most other vehicles in this class don't even offer, or charge $1,000 for as an upgrade. Plus, when the third-row seats are folded down, the Outlander offers generous cargo capacity, and with the second row seats folded, there is plenty of room for hauling even large, bulky objects. As for the driving performance, it is true that the 4-cylinder engine is a bit underpowered. Acceleration is sluggish, but that's the tradeoff for the great fuel economy. Besides, my wife and I aren't race car drivers, and we find the overall performance more than adequate. The overall comfort of the leather seats (first and second rows) is very good, the standard sound system is quite good and road noise is quite good. We are only a couple months in, but so far so good with the Outlander. Honestly, I feel this vehicle represents, by far, the best family SUV value on the market, and after looking at MANY other options, I just could not get away from the fact that Mitsubishi offers consumers a lot more for their money than other manufacturers. Add in the great warranty and I am confident that this Outlander will serve our family's needs for many years.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,PK, 10/02/2016,"Outlander excellent, auto media reviews are biased",5,"Biased and disconnected auto media... Why do the Edmunds owner reviews not reflect this horrible car you profess? Your credibility is doo-doo.  Real proactive lockable 4WD with torque vectoring and major ground clearance (~2+ inches more than most). You only get this grade 4WD (~Quadra Drive II) as a spendy option on a Limited or better Grand Cherokee. $50k for starters. Not even available with most other mfger's. You could stick with the cheapo reactive 4WD (a simple ABS mod actually) where it kicks in after the wheels slip. Great! AWD kicks in -AFTER- you're already sliding into the ditch! Shame on you Subaru for going this route to bump your fuel ratings. Oh well, join the club then. OMG, doesn't handle like a CX5? No kidding, it's biased for 4x4 capability, not car-like compromise. Unfortunately you can't evaluate 4WD capability in the ten minutes the auto journalists spend with the car in southern California. 3rd row seating is tight? How many SUV's in this class have 3rd row? Right, it's not a Suburban, why compare it to one? Low on power? Acceleration is the same as prior model Toyotas and Honda's, but nothing was said about them at the time. I'll take tried and true power train over ""experimental"" systems that boost power at the cost of reliability (widespread direct injection teething problems, Chrysler 9 speed transmissions, etc). It's criticized that Mitsubishi has the lowest output V6 available. How many of the small SUV's are available with a V6? Almost none. And the power to weight ratio is the same as a Grand Cherokee with the Pentastar, which is panned as ""more than adequate"" power. Notice the 100% ""built in Japan""? That means all parts are high quality. Look at US built cars. 70% US parts, with 30% coming from Vietnam,China, etc.. Have to offset the cost of the good stuff with some crap. Oh, and the crap is the stuff the mfgr has no warranty or accountability for. Wear parts; Shocks, brakes, ball joints, tires, tied rods,etc.. Plan on replacing those at 30k miles. The Fosgate audio system gets criticized hard too. Give me a break. It's the best sounding system out there. It destroys the Logic 7 in my old BMW. The head unit isn't a technical wonder, but oh, the sound... My biggest problem is that they are comparing MSRP to MSRP. To compare apples to apples you should compare -actual- average purchase price. What they are selling for, not what they'd like to sell them for. Throw in the 60k/10 year bumper to bumper and it's an easy choice for a lot of people. Problem is they don't even drive one after they read the 5 minute test drive review from the guy who re-printed the previous year review, who just got out of a Land Rover and a Corvette. This vehicle needs a proper review, unbiased, with attention to detail, with no comparisons to vehicles that are dissimilar. Mitsubishi is not getting a fair shake here.

Update 4/28/2018: Same opinion, no regrets. 43k miles without a problem. Yeah, it's a snowmobile in the winter. Lock the S-AWC into snow mode and forget about it. Still a smooth ride, bangin' stereo. The versatility of the fold down 3rd row seats has been more valuable than I thought. I won't buy another SUV without it. I have managed to deactivate the power hatch twice with the little button in the lower center console. I thought it was broken, but nope, my fault. I still like the looks a lot, it hasn't gotten old. It does seem like a much bigger vehicle than it is.  Roomy and can pack lots of stuff in it, but it parks easy and can fit into tight spots. Lastly, when I bring it into service at White Bear Mitsubishi, I see the two crashed Outlanders proudly displayed out front. High speed accidents with semi trucks. Both drivers had minor injuries. The ""Rise"" safety frame technology in these Outlanders is no joke. Gives me as piece of mind about my purchase every time I drive in. I'll be back for the PHEV
 version at some point. Happy camper. .

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Jeff W., 02/01/2016,Take another look.,4,"This is as honest as a car gets.   There's no flashy advertising, no crazy hamsters driving it around, you get the picture.   I bought this when we traded in our 2011 GMC Terrain.   Our Terrain was loaded to the gills with options but it was becoming unreliable.   We got the Outlander SEL with AWD and the safety package which comes with rain sensing wipers, automatic headlights, adaptive cruise and collision mitigation.    I was surprised when we were shopping to learn that this was a top safety pick, so we gave it a shot.  So far it has been great in this Buffalo winter and has had no issues in the slop that populates the roadway this time of year.   No heavy snow yet but I'm confident this will be fine.  The rear seat fits both our car seats with ease and I don't have to have my seat all the way forward for them to be comfortable (I'm 6'4"").   The passenger seat could use some more room for us tall folk but that seems to be the norm for this segment.   The warranty can't be beaten since it's bumper to bumper for 60k for 5 years and it includes free roadside during that time as well.  The financing options are very good also.  We have average credit and were able to get 3.5% for 65 months with the option to turn the car in at 48 months with 60k miles and just walk away.   (We had some negative equity on the GMC)  So if you're sitting there thinking you can't afford a new car, you really can and it will be worth it to have a warranty for 60k miles.   Overall you can't beat what you get for the money with this car.   If you're in the market for a crossover that gets decent gas mileage, take another look at Mitsubishi.   You'll be surprised what you find.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Michael Blades, 04/19/2016,Better than Reviewed,5,"I read a bunch of reviews but wanted something specific: a car that could hold an extra smaller kid when I needed it and 30 mpg on the highway.  Alternatives were a minivan...nope.  A ton of cash...nope.  Or a Journey or a Rogue.  The Journey with leather seats and AWD came out with less mileage and more $.  Plus they have not been reliable and have a short warranty.  The Rogue back seat was ridiculous, plus no leather with that extra seat option. 

-So I went back and forth on the Outlander because it got middling to poor reviews, particularly with Consumer Reports.  But I realized the poor reviews came in areas I do not care about because I drive like a grandma.  Acceleration slow?  So what.  Some lean on corners?  Who cares.  I stick the thing in Eco mode X 2 (AWC Eco and the Standard Eco) and get 34 on the highway with an AWD vehicle on a nice day.  
-It's also comfortable and quiet and my 35 mile commute in the am is incredibly pleasant.  
-The warranty is king, and I took it to the life of my payments (84 months...at 0.9%..Yeah, seriously)  for 1200 bucks.  
-The safety ratings are outstanding.
-It looks good with a metallic coppery brown exterior and beige leather interior.
-I'm happy.

I must tell you that the critics must not know anything at all based on what they have to say about the Outlander.

I will likely never buy another Subaru based on how much better the Mitsubishi Outlander is when compared to the Subaru Tribeca.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Priji Eapen, 09/14/2015,Great Improvements from the previous year model!,4,"I owned a 7 seater Outlander 2014 before. When I did a test drive of the 2016 model, I was quite surprised to see the improvements that  Mistubishi made in the 2016 model. I've noticed a considerable reduction in outside noise and vibration. They’ve made significant improvements to the performance of the vehicle as well. 2014 Outlander lacked the responsiveness you’d expect when you press the gas pedal. Mitsubishi addressed this issue and new model is much more responsive compared to the previous year models. Ride comfort is also better.  Although not significant, improvements to the interior and the steering wheel are also adding to the overall improved appearance of the interior. 2016 Outlander is fun to drive. Although the the third row seats are not ideal for adults, it serves its purpose when we have to occasionally transport 7 people in a single car.

I’d say there is room for more improvements. However, this is definitely a step in the right direction for Mitsubishi. Hope they keep improving the Outlander to make it even better. I feel that the SE model offers a great value for the price you pay for the vehicle.

In the 97,000 miles I had the car. It was a very good vehicle. Only routine maintenance and a set of tires was all the money I spent on it. It ran great and was a comfortable ride. The Rockford Fosgate sound system was top notch too. I never had any annoying squeaks or rattles which attests to the build quality. I did not buy another Mitsubishi, but I would if it fit my needs. This time around I no longer needed a 3rd row and I wanted something with a bit more pep. Had the eclipse offered something in the 250+ HP I would of considered it.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Sid L, 04/04/2016,A hidden gem,5,"First off - I have never reviewed a car on edmunds before but I want buyers to do justice to this car before coming to any conclusions based on the edmunds expert review. This is not a luxury car but gives a near luxury feel based on features provided. Safety test results are at the top most tier - IIHS top pick + also A sub 30K car that gives you forward collision warning , lane departure warning amongst other features is a no brainier. Most Japanese and German cars have this only on highest end models that are easily 40-45k plus. Mitsubishi has a best in class warranty. A practical 7 seater with excellent mileage & sufficient acceleration.

*** Updated April 2017***** Still
Going strong with 20k miles. No issues so far. Mileage has improved. Good all weather traction.. have driven in all conditions - rain slow ice ... Mileage is phenomenal for a 7 seater SUV 25 - 27 MPG. With the aditional safety features like lane departure warning and auto braking / radar cruise control - the pricing is a steal

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Colin, 02/14/2016,great crossover worth repeating,5,"Trade in a V6-GT and got a 2016 SEL. Ride is improved, the sport mode work great, and I did not miss the V6. We own CRV, and Forester, and tested RAV4 and Escape. The winner is the Outlander. It is more than just better value. It is a very good car. The car is made in  Japan, and except brake and tire, there are no service needed for the 105K drive. 2016 Outlander ride is better than the forester. The acceleration is better than CRV. It is not muddy like the RAV4. Mazda is always louder than all the above.
The 2016 SEL did not have HID headlight, but still plenty bright. The Bluetooth is not the best, but it work. It did not have big sun-roof like the Outlander sport or forester, but not deal breaker. The y are selling well, so we settle one in black.
Overall, a happy repeat buyer after two weeks.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Rob, 08/04/2016,Four months after buying and still loving it,5,"We shopped for a year before deciding on the 2016 outlander sel. When we started our search the ""Mitsu"", as my wife calls it, wasn't even on the list. One reason it didn't make the list was the horrible reviews from ""experts"".  After looking for a while we narrowed it down to the Nissan Rogue and the 2016 Mazda CX-9. The main requirements we had was a three row SUV that got decent gas mileage. Well once pricing came out on the cx9 that pretty much ruled that vehicle out. We owned a 2008 cx9 and loved it and really liked the new design but the sticker price combined with the mediocre gas mileage with premium fuel was just too much. So we test drove the rogue and actually really liked the way it drove but the options on the mid level trim were slim for the price. The mid level is the only trim with 3 rows and leather isn't even an option. So we decided to try the outlander and drive it the same day. I didn't think it drove as well as the rogue but it had a few things going for it. 1. It was bigger, much bigger in the 3rd row 2. It got basically the same mpg even with the increased size. 3. It had a TON more options including leather, sub woofer, moonroof, led lights... 4. It was cheaper than the Nissan.  We were sold. There are some complaints. The average mpg gauge resets after 8 or so hours so you don't actually get the average mpg per tank. The handling is ok but not great, 2008 cx9 was better. Thought it had led daytime running lights but it's just led parking lights in the front. Infotainment center is a little behind the times, still works fine but hard to navigate. Things we really like: third row is fine for kids even our 12 year old. Gas mileage we average around 28 but constantly get over 30 mpg on highway trips. The subwoofer is awesome, great stereo. The warranty was an added bonus especially when compared to the competition. The power is sufficient, I know many reviews talk about the lack of power but most parents don't actually need a 8 second 0-60 time, they prefer savings at the pump and I appreciate the fact Mitsubishi recognizes that. We leave ours in Eco mode and are more than happy with the acceleration. So the short version, if you need a 3 row suv that gets great gas mileage and has a long list of features, make sure to test drive an outlander.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Wayne O., 03/20/2016,"3 1/2 years and 40,000 miles",4,"Update at 49K and 4 1/2 years. Battery died a couple months ago, replaced it myself, easy job. Other than that just oil changes and car runs and runs. Took road trip recently and got 35 mpg using eco mode. It takes some getting used to running eco mode as it is more sluggish but the reward is great gas mileage for a 7 passenger SUV. May look at replacing next year. Would like more safety features like blind spot monitoring and collision avoidance. We'll see what we buy but definitely would consider another Outlander. Update at 40K. Vehicle continues to work well, no further issues. Just get in it and go. I don't know if I would go for the black leather interior again with our Texas heat. If the car has been sitting in a parking lot for a few hours it is beastly hot inside... Did replace headlight again. Tried some higher intensity bulbs but the did not shine very far ahead. They don't last long but they are easy to replace. I have several spares now. Update at 35,000 miles, still a very good vehicle. Had another recall and got that fixed. Had to replace tires and found out if you have a tire place replace the tire pressure sensors, they cannot program them. Only Mitsubishi dealer can. A $245 error on my part. The tire place said there were 2 bad sensors and charged me $60 a piece to replace them, then could not program them so dealer charged me $125 to program them and told me they would have been covered under warranty. Ouch. Runs well, gets great gas mileage and everything still works. Had to change a flat tire and everything worked flawlessly. Will keep this car for a long time if it continues to perform as it has so far.
Update at 26,000 miles. Needed a few manufacturer recalls done but other than that no major problems. Did have to change a headlight that burned out. It was fairly simple. I noted that the bulbs have expected life of 150 to 175 hrs. That is not very long. I suggest buying a 2 pack to have handy. The OEM oil drain plug started leaking and I replaced with aftermarket one and that fixed the problem.

If you have never driven a CVT it will take you a while to get used to it. We had a turbo charged vehicle with a 6 speed tranny before and it would really take off after the turbo lag. It takes a while to accelerate with a 4 cyl and a cvt. Other than that the car is really great. The Rockford Fosgate premium stereo system really rocks. I do wish the power lift gate was foot activated. Have not taken it on a long trip to check mileage but computer is saying around 30 mpg. Our much smaller car before would be lucky to get 23. The 3rd row seats are really only good for kids but nice to have in this size vehicle. This vehicle has been very reliable and we have taken it on long trips. Very well built. So tight you have to slam the doors to get them to close. Quality is evident.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Mohammed Habib, 11/17/2016,WOW!,4,"I spent 6 months researching cars. We rent a tiny little parking space in NYC width wise, and we were restricted to a car that is less than 75"" wide. The family also got a little larger, and we needed a car with at least 6 seats. SO logically I went and researched the top most 7 seat SUVs, which were the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and the Nissan Rogue. To be completely honest, a 5-10 minute test drive of each of those cars, they felt the same. After seeing the width of Highlander, pilot and pathfinder, I realized none of these will do. I went at the nissan dealer, got a final cost of a rogue which with tax came out to almost $31,500. The rogue came with cloth seats, navigation and some extra stuff. Then out of nowhere saw an advertisement for outlander. We went to go see it, and instantly fell in love with it. Now all those negative reviews on different websites, where did they come from? I am driving a FAMILY SUV, I DEFINITELY don't need it to go from 0-60 in 3 seconds, I am completely fine with it going in 8 seconds. I have the AWC, but keep it off most of the time because I want to save gas. I love the leather, especially since it has on every part of the trim. I opted in for the SEL AWC. One thing that is lacking is the screen. Nower days the cars come with touch screen vs buttons, but I will gladly press buttons and pay 6k less. All honesty this car feels and drives like its worth $35,000. I got 3k miles on it, and took a 900 mile road trip and everything worked wonderfully. ONE very little thing is the paint chip and scratches. You just gotta be careful how you drive the car that's all, and take any paint chip issues straight to the dealer and they will fix it right away.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Najib Wong, 07/11/2016,In a segment by itself,5,"Updated review - Jan 2018
Outlander is still awesome. We had a snow storm and even with all season tires, the snow mode gave me a lot of confidence. Other than oil changes, the car had been solid. Mpg is lower than advertised. The only thing I wished it has is heated steering wheel. 


Original review
What you should know is that the outlander is in a segment that has almost zero competition in North America. It is the 3 row compact class. It's just there outlander and the rogue. And the rogues dont come with a V6. Reviewers compare the outlander to 2 row CUVs or 3 row mid size SUVs. Regardless, no other car epitomizes value like the outlander. V6, power lift gate, sunroof, rain sensing wipers, wiper de-icers, 18"" wheels, fosgate sound, s-awc, power folding side mirrors, leather etc. All at a lower price point. I can't speak about reliability as I just bought the car but the handling and comfort is definitely at least a B+. It's not a sports car. It's a family vehicle. My kids love the car. We find a excuse to drive as a family.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Dokako, 10/21/2017,Don't believe the professional reviewers,5,"I have had my 2016 Outlander SEL for about 5 months now. We had a 2006 outlander  with 185XXX miles on before we purchased the 2016 and had no problems with it. I have thought for years now that the Consumer Reports test drivers are out of touch with the average driver. We don't all need Top of the line everything in a family car. I also don't need the latest electronic infotainment system, it will be outdated by next year anyhow. I don,t drive my car on a race track and I do not drive like an idiot on the freeway. The car looks great, handles great, has one of the best warranties, is plenty quite for me, has great quality and great features. When I tell people that I paid $21000.00 for an AWD fully loaded Outlander with a 10 year warranty from White Bear Mitsubishi they don't believe me.  People - do not take the Consumer Report review as gospel, try one yourself

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,charles, 03/08/2016,more than I expected in every way !,5,"Looked at a lot of SUV,s Ford, GM, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda, Hyundai, Kia. I was replacing a Chevy Captiva that was almost out of warrenty. Never considered a Mitsubishi before but seen how long the warrenty was on them. After reading the critics reviews on the Mitsubishi Outlander I almost didnt consider it. I sure glad I took the time to go look at one in person and drive one. I was sold in a mile !  The Mazda was noisy and road ruff. Ford Escape was ok but didn't like rear seat room or the packages they offered for the price. Hyundai and Kia are only 
a good value if you buy the base ones. GM Trax was really nice but again was too small. Toyota Rav 4 was very unimpressive and pricing was very high for what you recieved and the warrenty was half as long as the Mitsubishi. Nissan, well what can I say, again high price, worst CVT transmission I drove, Lots of consumer complaints .  If you go and drive the competition then drive the Mitsubishi and consider price and warrenty I think you will be driving one home like I did !!  Update..Been over 6 months now and i feel the same as I did before. Great on gas, very quite, smooth ride. Family and friends that have drove it can't belive that this didnt cost over 30,000 dollars. The only thing I could say needs to be improved is the voice link system. although the sound system sound great, the link system is not, very slow, touch screen is slow, some phones blutooth will not work with it. I hope in the future they will offer a update with android auto.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Morgan Dickey, 02/25/2016,Love My New SUV,5,"Traded in my Mitsubishi Mirage (2015) for the Outlander ES Feb 19. Fell in love with it immediately. The step up in brakes and steering alone was awesome.
The Mirage brakes were horrible, the steering fair. Sure there are better brakes and steering out there, but for a big SUV it's pretty nice. Have driven a Ford
Fusion (rental), it does feel similar, at least to me. The blue tooth is great in it. First Cruise control for me. Really like it. The seats are comfortable. Could maybe use
an extra adjustment on the seat, but it does feel comfortable. The biggest complaint is the big headrests on the third row seats, do block the rear view a little, but
they are removable, so not a huge deal.The radio stereo is the basic brand, but it's a huge step up from the Mirage's stereo. The Mirage you had to play your mp3
music at nearly full volume. The Outlander at twenty four the music is pretty loud. So far only really drove it back and forth from work, but so far I'm loving every
moment. This is no where near the top vehicle on the road, but it is a value SUV. The Mirage wasn't a bad vehicle either. The biggest downside probably would
be the gas mileage. From the Mirage I got around 37 MPG regularly, never less than that from fill up to fill up. Looking now at a possible 26 MPG area. I would 
recommend this SUV to people looking for a nice vehicle for family driving or light hauling. The towing capacity is pretty light on this vehicle. It's listed at only
fifteen hundred pounds. The Continuously Variable Transmission is fine on the ES model. You can punch it and go with little effort.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Casey, 10/16/2016,Great value & features,5,"I'm in my 13th year in the car business and I don't work for a Mitsubishi dealer. This is the best SUV in the class. The engine and transmission are time tested and solid. Yes it's still timing belt driven but this engine is going to last!! The ride quality is smooth and quite. The upgraded Rockford Fosgate sound system is fantastic, spend some time playing with all the different sound options and find the one that sounds best with your music. Plus you get one of the best warrantys out there.

Update: 2 years and 34,000 miles later and still no issues.

Almost 4 years and 56,000 miles this vehicle is proving to be one of the best purchases I have ever made. I still have not had any issues at all. It still rides smooth and quiet, I did put new tires on it a couple months ago. I just purchased a 17’ center console fishing boat. It weighs about 2000 lbs and it pulls in very nice. 
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2016,JT, 12/15/2015,"Great car, practical!",5,"This is my first Mitsubishi. We had a Mazda5 2013 for almost 3 years but decided to sell it after bad crash rating released recently and major warranty work on the engine tappets (not a good sign). So we were looking for an SUV with third-row that's not a full size or V6, and it boils down to Mitsubishi Outlander or Nissan Rogue (with 3rd row option and run-flat tires since the third row takes over the spare tire space). We test-drove our friend's 2015 GT and was quite surprised with the car and I was glad to find many improvements was done to 2016 version. The Rogue is out of question since we would rather have spare tire than using run-flat tires.

We ended up getting the cosmic blue 2WD SEL with roof rack, and exterior package. The car is primarily driven by my wife and she couldn't be happier with it and I also really enjoyed the car. I drove it to the mountain and the Bay many times, the performance is good. I'm not sure why the the reviewers from certain auto mag and review sites gave it such low mark (biased-much?). The engine power is decent, don't believe when reviewers slammed about how slow the car is getting into freeway ramps. I lived in CA and drove to the SF and the bay many times and it gets to the ramp fine even in fast paced traffic. Maybe those pro reviewers are so spoiled with testing high end cars and have snobby attitudes against more affordable car for the masses. I also used to own 2007 Acura MDX with technology package and I enjoy driving the Outlander more than the MDX to be honest.

I can't say anything about the warranty yet but the 10-year 100k miles warranty should give you peace of mind. All in all, this car deserves a look, it's a great people mover, fun enough for weekend driving and it's priced great for it's class.

PS: look for real world reviews in youtube and websites. This car is actually selling well in Europe and not sure why it's hardly heard in US (I would blame Mitsubishi North America marketing department for this). The plugin Hybrid version is selling like hotcakes in Europe and will come to US sometimes next year.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,C Sigrist, 12/22/2016,Exceptional vehicle despite poor reviews.,5,"After researching which car to buy for months, I finally decided on the Outlander SEL 2WD.  Most of the automotive magazines hate this car and I'm not sure why.  I love my Outlander! I have a fairly significant commute; about 60 miles a day so fuel economy was an important factor.  The Outlander gets the best mileage of any other non-electric SUV out there.  I put it in eco-mode and I'm getting an average of over 30 mpg. The acceleration is not zippy but it is fine.  I also opted for the safety package which gives adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance.  I really like having both of those features.  I would never have thought to buy a Mitsubishi but happened to be looking at a used car at a dealership and the salesman convinced me to test drive the Outlander.  This vehicle is an exceptional value.  The purchase price is considerably less than any other similarly sized SUV out there.  It comes with a great warranty and roadside assistance.  Do yourself a favor and go test drive one.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,JD Anderson, 10/19/2015,2016 OUTLANDER SEL AWD,5,"This vehicle has rugged good looks and sensible features. Where else can you find a third row AWD wagon under 30,000? Initially my wife and I  were drawn to the Subaru Forester, but after thorough review and test driving, determined that the quality of the Forester felt too small inside for our growing family and the materials not as durable as we would expect for the price. So, I continued researching all of the recommended models comparable to the  Forester. Subsequently I test drove the Outlander SE AWD and the SEL AWD. A local dealer was offering a manangers special on a 2015 SE AWD at an ubeatable price. I test drove and fell in love with the outstanding practicallity of the design and relatively understated body design- more about rugged simplicity than urban bling. I took the test drive alone, with my wife trusting me to come home with a ""managers special"". My wife would have been perfectly satisfied with the SE, but I couldn't help taking notice of the 2016 SEL AWD on the lot. I took a test drive, and I was definitely impressed. Still functional and spacious,  and the 2.4 L engine adding the power some may expect from this bigger SUV AWD wagon. I took it upon myself to go over our budget and surprise her with the  2016 Outlander SEL. I was a bit anxious, as my wife is more practical than myself and really would have lived with the winier 2.0 liter 2015 SE without complaint. For the price difference- I thought the upgrade to the SEL would be a good long term choice for the family. My wife is driving the vehicle daily and sends me messages throughout the day expressing her enjoyment the car. In my opinion, Mitsubishi is offering great AWD wagon packages for the value-minded that appreciate classic rugged good looks and AWD driving functionality. The expert reviews do not cover many of the positive attributes that make this SUV such an exceptional value, such as the alternative AWD modes- totally absent in most of the other SUV wagons. The Outlander is a unique SUV and deserves far more credit than the experts give it.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,clint, 08/27/2015,i'm in love with this car1,4,"This is my second car from Mitsubishi.  My first was the 2014 Mirage.  This is an upgrade leap frog years from what i had.  the vehicle picks up speed from a standstill like a jag, leaving other vehicles in it's dust.  The ride is smooth, handles well, downshifts like a race car, sound system is boss, beautiful 18 alloy rims, no need to get after market's there.  The look of the car is sexy, the grill reminds me of something from the Transformers.  Get this car! you can't go wrong!

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Deborah Garcia, 04/05/2016,Almost but not quite,2,"The third seat is difficult for children of any age to get into.  The seat belts are impossible for 5 year olds to get on by themselves and impossible to reach from outside the car! There are no charging ports Back there and the cup holder is only on one side. The 7th seat belt is a joke. 
The  paint is a very low quality,  it has already chipped all over the hood,  my car is 6 months old now but i noticed it 2 week's  after purchasing.  I emailed the salesman,  he did not respond, went in to talk to them but they pawned me off on a manager that acted like it was normal,  it's not.  So disappointed!

In addition to the above, now 1 years since purchase the paint on the car looks like I have owned it for 5 or more years and I don't know the point of adding these comments because NOBODY cares if they did someone would have contacted me by now to see how to resolve my issues with the paint. Why should I have to figure out where to get the money to repaint my car when it is barely 1 year old??? Why wouldn't the dealer (Firkins in Bradenton, FL) care about my comments regarding their lack of interest in looking into the paint issue??? I buy a new car every 3 or 4 years but I won't buy this one again and I definitely won't get it from Firkins!!!

Almost 3 year update:
every little plastic piece has fallen off and no matter how  many times you put them back on they won't stay. The car has gotten much louder. IN FL it is already near impossible to cool a vehicle down and there is NOT 1 vent past the front seats. The paint continues to flake off the hood!

4 full years update:
Mechanically the vehicle is still running very well. The paint, mainly the hood, looks terrible. I have looked at other cars of the same model and none of them looks like mine and I have never owned any other car that the paint chipped off of like this one. My grandkids are now 3, 5, 8 and 11 and the 8 and 11 year old's do not fit in the backseat which is a problem because the car seat the 3 year old is in can't go back there and 3 children DO NOT fit on the middle seat with the car seat. The interior has no plastic pieces they kept falling off and so I stopped putting them back on and some are now lost. The dealer has only since contacted me to see if I'm ready to buy another car, NOT from Firkin's in Bradenton... NEVER AGAIN!!!!

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Marly Simsuangco, 08/21/2016,Happy To Switch!,5,"I was looking for a car to replace my 2009 MB E350.  This is basically a company car that I use for work.  I love it but the maintenance cost is brutal.  The higher ups got tired of the expenses and ordered me to get a new car.  I actually picked a Mazda CX-5 and was ready to get the papers when I walked by the Outlander...... It sounds weird but it felt good to be next to it and I just had to test drive it!  Needless to say, I completely forgot the Mazda and bought the Mitsubishi Outlander SEL!  I brought my ""Navy Mitsu"" home the next day and love it!
-------------------
Well, after driving the car now for over a month and adding over a couple thousand miles.....the gas is great, savings galore since it uses regular instead of 93.  Pick up is a little slow but it is a 4 cylinder.  The 2nd row seats are ok, mind you, my son is 6'5"" and it is a little hard for him.  The 3rd row is a little useless so I just keep it down.  Overall, I do miss the luxury of my MB but this is worth the money because it gets you where you want to go and the gas economy is great, and the drive is smoother than you would think.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Mark Hunter, 10/31/2016,Tough enough for Australia,5,"Everyone gushes about how much they love their new car, of course. We were in Australia for three months, and drove two of these for just over 10,000 KM (about 6,300 miles). This is a useful seven passenger three row size, partway between the smallest and biggest SUVs. The Outlander’s third row seat is not the biggest, but it does offer about a foot and a half more room between the second row and the hatch. That means a lot to us on an extended road trip with lots of luggage and gear.

We drove the ES/SE (rental hybrid of trim levels) with the 2.4 CVT in Australia, and bought the SE S-AWC a month ago here in DFW. I had the same experience as other private reviewers. I don’t understand what the pros are talking about when they say this doesn’t have enough power. I never had to floor it to merge into traffic. It has plenty of power for passing, easily goes from 55 to 70 uphill in the mountains with a full load of gear, and tachs at 2,300 when cruising at 70. 

It has a very smooth stable ride, a good driving position with comfortable seats, feels confident when cornering, and brakes well. The interior is remarkably quiet. The salesman said it has acoustic glass. Who knows? One feature not available on any other small SUV (that I am aware of) is the ability to disengage the AWD system altogether, using just the FWD and saving a penny on gas. We test drove most of the manufacturers, and could feel the difference between the AWD and the FWD.  The Outlander’s AWD was not noticeable whether engaged or not. We spent a lot of time and miles in the Outlander ES/SE in Australia, and found it (and Australia) altogether agreeable. 

We test drove the GT (V6) and the Sport (shorter wheelbase). The GT and the Sport have firmer rides for different reasons. The seven passenger ES S-AWC 2.4 CVT is the way for us to go. It’s an all day driver, and carries our full load of gear without breaking a sweat.

Update May 2017. Still like the ride and drive. Worst gas mileage was 21 mpg going west on I-40 at 70 mph up from Amarillo at 1000 ft elevation to Tucumcari New Mexico at 6000 ft elevation into a gale force headwind that blew through the door seals. The cvt was bouncing the rpm’s to almost 4000. We were passing all the big trucks (for a change). The best gas mileage was 33 mpg coming from El Paso east on I-20 through the oil patch to Midland/Odessa. Speed limit was 80. Must have been a tailwind.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,John, 01/05/2016,Great for dad and kids in the city,5,"I needed a car with a third row for occasional use by young children (depending on how many kids I'm commuting with).  The car needed to be not huge -- something I can comfortably drive in traffic and park in tight spots.  I was happy with my venerable stick-shift Ford Focus, but it's now too small.  (At first I really wanted to get the 2014 Mazda5 6-speed manual, but crash test scores made me reconsider.)  After deciding that the Acura MDX was too expensive and the Dodge Journey a bit too bulky, I considered the Outlander along with the Nissan Rogue and the Kia Sorento.

Here's why I picked Outlander:
- Adding the 3rd row in the Rogue (family package) or 4-cyl Sorento (convenience package) adds roughly $1K to MSRP and rules out leather.  Maybe it's standard on the V6 Sorento.  The cloth on the Sorento is very sturdy, the Rogue and the Outlander pretty basic.  All the third rows are small (and fold away), but the Rogue's was extra small with very little vertical leg room (so knees go up).  The Outlander's third row is maybe slightly smaller than the Sorento's (but standard).  
- The warranty is better than Nissan (5 yrs > 3) and on par with Kia (slight edge to Mitsubishi on roadside assistance)
- During the test drive, the Outlander delivered comparable acceleration with less CVT screaming than the Rogue.  Power and handling seemed comparable to the base Sorento, but with somewhat less snap around center steering.  The Sorento also offers a turbo 4-cyl but without third row seat (sigh).   
- It's just a good looking car.  I really liked the ""cosmic blue"" and the ""quartz brown.""  The Sorento has a nice ""dark cherry"" though.
- Better standard sound system with HD radio.  
- If you like 4WD, it has selectable active 4WD vs the passive AWD I believe you get on the Rogue and Outlander.  I'm just leaving it on ""eco"" until it snows or something.

Here's how Mitsubishi could make me like the Outlander even more:
- One-push turn signal for lane changes (see the Sorento)
- Make auto on/off headlights standard (currently only with safety package or GT trim, I believe)
- There's a lot of empty space under the hood.  Maybe this space is used by the GT model, or by right-hand steering on Japanese versions?  Maybe it could be shifted for greater front leg room.
- Provide a non-CVT option (below GT trim)
- It was hard to find an SEL trim with FWD.  I wound up getting a 4WD I didn't really need just due to pricing and inventory.
- At least with Kia and Nissan you get final assembly in USA.  Mitsubishi just closed its only USA factory.

It's definitely bigger than what I drove before, but the kids and I enjoy it.  We were saving up for it, so I paid cash (there's a cash back incentive or zero APR, but not both -- also a nice military rebate) and still had a little left over for their college savings!

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,AL, 03/02/2016,HIDDEN GEM OUT THERE,5,"I currently own a 2014 Rogue and 2013 BMW X3 Msport. Comparing the ride quality, this suv beats both vehicle. Even if its a CVT, comparing it to my Rogue, when accelaration is needed, it does not hesitate and I dont hear the engine rev so much as compared to the Rogue. The CRV and RAV4 are overated.
There is nowhere that they are up to par with this vehicle. I believe the only reason why consumers out there dont even consider Mitsubishi when shopping a car is because of their bad reputation for the past 10 years but I will honestly admit that they have come a long way to improve it. I am so thankfull that I went to a Mitsubishi dealer ""just to see"" what they got and boy!!! I was in for the ride that instant. If you are shopping for a vehicle that fits budget and have the basic perks especially....""""ride comfort and style...Then I highly recommend to check this vehicle ""no kidding"" they say that the exterior style is ugly? I dont think so! Iit better looking than a CRV or RAV4 and it looks bigger too! If you look it sideways, its similar to a BMW X5 although..They could have done better in the vehicles front fascia.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Eric Vanhinkle, 06/08/2016,Great Car Horrible Paint,1,"I purchased this car with 4 miles on it.  I noticed after my first oil change that there were specs on the car's hood.  Very small at first then increasing to the size of a pea.  At my next oil change I mentioned it to service who took pics and sent to corporate as the dealer cannot make warranty decisions on leather and paint.  I had the regional director of service come out and inspect my vehicle who took more pics and turned into corporate.  I was told these were stones and not covered under warranty.  While I am not a care engineer, repair or sales person, I would think that if I was hit by something hit my car hard enough to chip my paint to the gray primer there would probably be a dent, which there is not.  As the chips are increasing in numbers and size, I am anticipating my entire hood will be gray and not the beautiful cosmic blue before the loan is even paid off.  So buyer beware and google mitsubitshi paint and I will assure you that one of the suggested phrases is mitsubitshi paint ""chips"" or ""problems"".

You'd think Mitsubishi spit in the face at all the reviewers at one time or another for them to raise such an eyebrow on this vehicle.  Edmunds rates it a C.  This vehicle is B+ at the least.  Edmunds claims the interior quality is cheap, but it is really no worse (better in my opinion) than many competitors that I drove.  Get into a Honda CRV and see how much racket you can make with your fingernails on the abundance of plastic haunting the dash, and then get in here and you tell me what you see and feel.  The AWD system is fantastic, one winter down with it and it absolutely crushes anything (within reason, of course) you throw at it.  Gas mileage is average, but pleasant for the size.  Acceleration is good, with the 4 cylinder I noticed if you do have a few people in the car it will feel a bit groggy.  However, for everyday driving it should be more than adequate to the average person.  Safety was a huge plus for me here too.  Overall, I have 12,000 miles on it, have been driving it for over a year and no trouble yet.  Props to Mitsubishi!  With the pricepoint and warranty toppling anything else that's out there, you owe it to yourself to drive one.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Rusty Shackleford, 12/13/2016,I am a noob MItsubishi owner.,4,"So I just bought the 2016 Outlander ES 4WD, a few days ago. At the dealership, I test drove many vehicles including; the Jeep Compass, & the Hyundai Santa Fe. Both Vehicles had more features than my Outlander but once I drove that thing, I loved it. To me, it had the best ride feel, great price, and it feels like a larger SUV than what it really is. Mine is all black with black accented rims, so it looks sharp. I'm disappointed in all the expert reviews saying this car is average because it does not come with all the latest in cabin features, but I don't need lane assistance, parking assistance, or even the heated seats. This is a fantastic SUV, extremely underrated, and great price. The one thing I do agree on with the expert reviews is the third row seating. That thing might as well not exist, because only my 4 year old can fit back there.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Value Shopper, 04/02/2017,Do you yourself a favor and check it out,5,"This is my 4th Mitsubishi (2 Outlander, 1 Outlander Sport, and 1 Galant).  I like them since they have Japanese quality but with a Korean price tag.  This spells value to me. This is important since cars just loose money so the name of the game is to loose the least amount.  

Value in a large purchase is the most important item to me.  It is not status, top rated, looks, cool factor.... Bottom line my personal view of a car's job is to get you to point A to B with no issues, safely, and with comfort.  To add the status or the cost of the car should not limit the use of your vehicle since its only job is transportation.   The Outlander does this very well.  I have also found that it is hard to buy a popular car with built in value since the market places a high price point on it so your financial value is eroded due to supply and demand.  

I think the best way to buy any car with built in value is to buy it used.  I like to buy a car with low miles and sell it at around 90k/100k. I have done this with three Mitsu's (in fact with all of my cars) and in my experience the cars just run and all you have to do is keep the fluids clean and tires rotated/updated.  

One of the main reason why Mitsubishi does not receive high marks from the professionals is they typically make one car for all markets globally.  In fact they sell more cars outside the US.  The markets they do well in are rugged 2nd world and 3rd world locations where the car needs to work and it will be exposed to extreme conditions.  They also do well in certain 1st world countries where the economics of owning a car are different than in the US.  Example the PHEV is the best selling EV in England due to the tax incentives and price point of the vehicle.  This leads to a car that has a gap in features (tech and comfort) compared to cars made specifically for the US market.  If you think reliability and value are more important than tech and comfort Mitsubishi is a good car for you.    

When I was looking for my latest car I did not blindly pick the Outlander.  I drove all the its competitors CX5, CRV, Rav4, and Impreza/Crosstrek.  I also travel a lot and drove many others including the Cherokee, Rouge,  Santa Fe, Tucson, Renegade, 500X, QX30, Frontier, Explorer, Audi Q5, and Enclave.  Many of them I ruled out for personal fit (size, ride).  The ones I liked I did research by checking consumer reviews and used a detailed financial model to buy the best car for the money.  Please do this research since there a lot of rotten eggs out there.  Just look at the reviews of the Cherokee.  Its a great driving car but a horrible transmission.  That is a deal killer on any car. 

All the research came to one answer the 2016 Mitsu Outlander. The added benefit is the 2016 is refined.  It has a great ride, quiet, roomy, great viability, comfortable, and the biggest surprise is getting better gas mileage than my Outlander Sport that had a smaller engine and is lighter.  The 2016 Outlander is a very good car so it is worth a look.  Don't let the moderate professional reviews and lack of them on the road deter you.  

I also think the that Nissan recent investment in Mitsu will ramp up the promotion on the vehicle. Nissan needed the Mitsu's leading technology with 4WD, Plug in Hybrid, and electric.  

In my opinion their 4WD/AWD system is one of the best on the market giving you options on what to do when you are in the crud.  Mitsu are popular in harsher locations in the world.  This mean they are made to take on more than the average 4WD/AWD, take a beating, and still run.  

Bottom line go check on out you will be pleasantly surprised.

Update: 

Very happy with the Outlander and honestly the best vehicle I have owned.  I even say that with getting into an ""act of god"" accident where a tree limb fell and hit my car.  It caused $3,800 in damage resulting in a new radiator, AC
 condenser, and bumper.  I owned the car for 3 weeks.  The car is running great even after the repair.  

6 Months of driving I am averaging 29.6 MPG compared to my Sport that got 28.6.  I allays have it in ECO and most of my driving suburban/rural areas so traffic is low but there are intersections.  

I have also debunked the ""its too slow issue"".  You have many ways to make it faster.  Turn off ECO or shift it to DS.  Either one will give you more then enough speed for any situation.  In fact even in ECO I can get the acceleration I need.  

I have seen more Outlander on the road so I think the value is being recognized.  We will likely see a few more when the PHEV hits the dealers in December.  The PHEV looks like a well appointed and significantly less than any other PHEV on the market.   The big question you have to answer to step up to the PHEV is does the higher price pay for it in lower fuel cost.  This is simple math when all the final numbers come out.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Nathan Davidson, 03/22/2017,"Ignore the ""Experts"" - Give the Outlander a Chance",4,"FIRST, and most importantly, ignore the so-called experts who have continually panned the Outlander (and Mitsubishi in general). I'm not sure what the problem is, but their treatment of the brand comes off as wholly unwarranted if you look at the value and quality of their vehicles. Sure, their lineup isn't as elaborate as it once was, and sales have suffered, but that doesn't mean the vehicles they DO SELL are that bad. I owned the original 2003 Outlander for 5 years and 90k miles and loved it. I've probably owned 8 vehicles since then, and I still kick myself for ever selling it. Best ""New"" car purchase I ever made. I recently purchased a 2016 Outlander ES AWD. I've driven it almost 2 months now and can say that it is one of the best values out there for a Compact-to-Mid size SUV. The features available in the base models are functional and competitive with rivals. The higher-end models can get pricey, but they're still below par compared to the competition. The ride is good. It feels like you're driving a larger sedan. That's one of things that cracks me up about some of the expert reviews (both here, C&D, and other places). IT'S A 4 CYLINDER FAMILY SUV. It isn't going to corner, accelerate, brake, or sound like a Corvette. The CVT takes some getting used, but after a couple of days you don't even notice it. The acceleration from the VERY fuel-efficient 4cyl is more than adequate for us mere mortal drivers who are never going to take a 7-passenger SUV to the skid pad to get G results. I drive in stop-and-go traffic, every single day on the way to work and back. It is literally stop-and-go the entire way (I live 7 miles from my office, and commute is regularly over an hour). I've averaged around 24 MPG up to this point. I'm not sure what else to say - if you came here to see whether or not you should look at an Outlander, just go drive one. It's either for you or it isn't. Just don't let what appears to be a biased car media steer you away from what could be a great vehicle for you. In the meantime, I'm just going to sit here and ask the ""EXPERTS"" to show me another 25-30MPG SUV with AWD, 7-passenger capabilities, and Japanese build quality and reliability (and a great warranty) in this price range. Go ahead. I'm waiting.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,A Mitsu Fan Wannabe, 08/19/2017,Great value & Unique. Terrible factory Paint!,3,"Listen up.  I want to love my 2016 AWD Outlander.  My son and I bought one at the same time.  Unique in an Outback world.  Great rear cargo space (BTW, get the roof racks.... makes the car!). HWY mileage at 30+ is great.  Driver controlled ECO and AWD options a good thing.  Rubber band tranny takes getting used to but all good otherwise... EXCEPT the paint application on the hood and pillars ON BOTH OF OUR CARS is flawed.  Google it.  You will start seeing more complaints. I have owned Porsches, Lexus, Jags, Saabs, Volvos and everything American.  I have driven some to 100K and have not changed my driving habits (I know to stay back from trucks, am not four-wheeling my Mitsu, etc.).  Both my son's brown 2016 Outlander and my pearl white continue to chip away upfront.  I have more marks on my car than I have ever had when trading in 5+ year old vehicles with 5 times the mileage.  The regional Mitsu guy suggested no coverage and would not acknowledge any flaws to the paint (despite the fact I have had several new car dealers and exceptional auto body shops all acknowledge that this is faulty application and is ""soft, not cured properly"" paint. So.  If you think of buying an Outlander, ask the dealer to put a note on your P&S agreement that this will be covered if an issue for you and DO NOT BUY without installing a bra / wind screen.  Paint-sticking $56000 worth of two new mitsus that are maintained preciously should not even be a thing.  Can you say ""class action?"".

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Tyler, 10/28/2015,Outlandish Surprise,5,"I needed an affordable SUV for my family of 5. I looked at all options including some large sedans and mini vans. Then I came across the Outlander. I've had the car  for only about a month but I am totally impressed. It looks great, drives great, gets amazing gas mileage for a full size SUV. I am consistently getting 31-33 mpg on the highway and 29 mixed. I can get my wife and three kids in this thing and jump on the highway and go! It also doesn't require Premium gas just basic unleaded. I have the base model but I love it for what it is. A simple clean performer. The bluetooth phone connectivity works great and much better than my last 35 thousand VW. The stock wheels look very nice and fresh. It's also very quiet on the road. It's a just a real good performer for the tasks that I use it for. My model doesn't have all the bells and whistles but honestly I don't need Nav. I have my phone and it works great. I also love that I sit up high on the road. It's as high as most trucks and higher than most vans. It's got tons of cargo space and is really flexible when you're hauling people or cargo. The build quality feels good.  The ride feels solid with nice balance of road feel and comfort. It has high clearance so although I haven't tested it in the snow, I am expecting decent performance. The warranty is amazing. I simply do not believe that there is a better SUV buy out there for $19,785 especially one that sits 7. The Outlander will haul people and cargo and do it with style and great gas mileage. Plus you get the added bonus that they are not a dime a dozen. In a way they are a bit like a boutique company. I read all the reviews before I bought it and many complained about the lack of power. I don't get it. It has enough power. Is it fast? Fast enough. Is it a race car? No. In drive mode with ""Eco"" mode enabled at can at times feel a little sluggish but it's not that bad. If you feel the need you can always drop the shifter in ""sport"" mode, click off the ""Eco"" mode and get much snappier performance. I actually like that I can turn this stuff off and on. That way I can get great mileage most of the time but get performance when I feel like it's needed. So far I am really liking the Outlander

After having this vehicle for almost 3 years now I can honestly say I am very pleased with the purchase. It has performed perfectly with absolutely no down time, no repairs and no problems. I love that I can get up to 31-33 MPG on the highway but I can also carry all five of my family members in relative comfort. Great value!

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Andy J., 01/09/2017,Vastly under-rated vehicle,5,"If you believe the so-called professional reviews on the Outlander, you would be led astray; a bias definitely exists towards Mitsubishi.  I own three Mitsubishi cars and I believe they make a better car than Toyota, but with more bells and whistles yet a much lower price.  The rebates on these cars are insanely generous.  I have the 4 cylinder which is good enough for me, acceleration is acceptable as I am not looking to race anyone.  Nice interior.  Ride is very smooth and quiet.  I got the Premium sound system with mine and it's spectacular.   I expect quality to be outstanding based on my prior experience, and the warranty is excellent as it exceeds most manufacturers.  You owe yourself a look at the Outlander if you are looking for a small SUV.  The downside of Mitsubishi cars is that they depreciate greater than their Japanese cousins, simply due to market share and not quality; I don't care about this as I keep my cars a long time.  I almost bought an Avalon and I am glad I got this one instead--saved a lot of $$$ and this car is more practical.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Former Isuzu Guy, 02/06/2017,"Listen to the owners, not the ""experts""",4,"I recently posted the following review on another site:  This review subject to revision as time passes, of course, especially since I only took possession in October of 2016 and only have a little over 2,100 miles on the odometer. I looked at a LOT of similar vehicles before making the purchase, read a ton of reviews and took a couple of test drives as well before I plunked down the dough for the GT version (no extra add-ons, but I'll get into that later). This Mitsu provides very good ground clearance and real 4wd for those occasions when my business travel takes me off the pavement. So far, I've only needed the 4wd once and it extricated me from a severe mud-hole where awd would have had difficulty. Visibility from the driver's seat is very good in all directions. At first, I thought the seats somewhat uncomfortable, but now I don't. Dash controls are configured effectively but I'm still finding new ""stuff"". The radio sounds good, really good, but I'm not sure I am benefiting from nine speakers. I do worry about the big woofer in the back hatch area getting damaged, and I may try to figure some sort of grill guard to employ. I do appreciate that I have the option of both key and keyless operation, for both starting the vehicle and opening the doors. There's a lot of room inside this vehicle, especially when the rear seats are down (easily done). Several rear-seat passengers have said they are quite comfortable and like the options of both reclining and seat travel (although the seats don't really move that much). This is not a heavy vehicle so all the road cracks and bumps aren't soaked up by the suspension and soundproofing, but all-in-all a pleasant drive. As for the driving experience, let me just say it's enjoyable.

The little V6 hums along nicely and quietly and propels the vehicle as fast as I need it to. The handling is crisp and the vehicle holds the road well. I'm not the type that worries about 0-60 acceleration stuff, but this Outlander has no problem merging into traffic on expressways and interstates. I feel safe. Mileage so far has averaged 29 mpg during some long hauls, but only 25 mpg during mixed local use. The owner's manual recommends premium fuel, but all I've put in the tank has been regular. One matter I am having trouble adjusting to are the LED lights; I just don't like the curtain effect that is projected into the darkness. The Outlander provides the driver with the ability to easily adjust the beam angle, and that has helped a little. Of course, the whole world is lit up when the high beams are on. As already mentioned, this vehicle comes well-equipped, and in some ways with more features than I really needed or wanted. Nonetheless, I did add an oem bug/stone deflector (that does actually work), and also, a set of oem mud guards (that don't do a very effective job at minimizing wheel spray onto the body). I will also be adding some 3M protective film on the tailgate ledge as well as on the door sills and door edges to help minimize scrapes and chips. Mitsubishi should have included these four items as standard.

Many of the vehicles I examined fell short when comparing my needs and wants. Several had deceptive ground clearance specs; some vehicles had protruding air dams, front bumpers or exhaust components just waiting to get snagged and torn-off. Other vehicles claimed good ground clearance, but didn't truthfully say whether it was ""maximum"" or ""minimum"". In my opinion, the Outlander stacked-up well to other similar vehicles, and in many areas, better, especially when considering the out-the-door price and warranty coverage. True, many of the reviews, especially those by the so-called ""experts"" minimized or trashed this vehicle. However, most actual buyers/owners/users provided favorable reviews, and, I intend to agree with them.

This Outlander replaced an amazing Isuzu Trooper that gave me
 260,000 miles of reliable service. If Isuzu was still selling a Trooper-type vehicle in the USA, I would probably be driving a new one. I'm hoping the Outlander proves a reliable successor.

As of now, I’m enjoying this new vehicle and becoming more comfortable with it as the miles roll along. I believe, like the Trooper, it will provide me with good value. Maybe another update down the road??

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Lowsidr, 11/22/2016,Had a 2007 this is a major improvement.,4,"""Update 12-3-20"" 100k now. Aside from a simple accessory fuse, brakes and two batteries, zero issues. Still runs and drives as new, no rattles or shakes, air still ice cold and everything works as it should. Solid car, incredibly reliable and relatively fuel efficient for it's size. 


""Update 12-3-19"" We are right at 80k now, the Goodyear's are proving a brilliant replacement. No issues, car continues to be bulletproof.

Update 6-1-19"" We now have 66k on the car. Still rides, drives and looks almost new. 

Update 11/30/2018"" Battery was bad, car did blow two fuses, both problems were easily fixed but still annoying. We now have over 52k on the car, just replaced the tires with Goodyear Assurance ComforTred's as the stock tires were nearing their end. We LOVE the Goodyears and they were MUCH less expensive than replacing with OEM, supposedly they are rated for 80K, if they get 50K like the stockers i'll still be happy. We still love the car, it's still SUPER quiet, still getting great fuel economy, no shakes, wobbles rattles etc, aside from the batter and two fuses this has been bulletproof. We like it so much in fact that we may sell the Mercedes and get the Outlander Sport as a second car. Still don't ""get"" why the professional car reviewers bash the Outlander but it doesn't seem to matter, we are seeing more and more of these on the road and everyone I have met that has one loves it. Keep up the great work Mitsubishi! 

""Update 5/30/18: 39k and still loving our Mits. The battery might be going as it sounds a bit sluggish as we turn the car over. The two accessory plugs have quit working, it's probably a fuse. Other than that it's been wonderful and we can get 30mpg on the highway at 70-73mph and average about 23-25 in the city. The 3rd row seats have come in handy on a few occasions but i'd prefer the extra cargo over the seats if I was given a choice. All in all we'd buy another in a heartbeat, a bit bummed about the battery issue and accessory plugs but it's very minor and the vehicle is still under it's bumper to bumper so no biggie. If it was a Toyota/Honda/Nissan/American we'd be out of warranty so let that sink in, gotta love the 5/50 and 10/100 warranty, blows most of the competition away.""


UPDATE 5/29/17: 12k miles now without any issues whatsoever. Believe it or not I prefer driving this to my Mercedes E350. The ride is smooth and the cabin is so quiet it's hard to believe this is considered a budget vehicle. As far as the 4cyl motor? No problem, it's not a HP winner but it is much more than just adequate. Loving this car!"" 

My 07 had 233,000 miles on it and still ran as well as it did when new. It was by far the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned and that's what led me to the new 2016 Outlander SEL. The new Outlander is entirely a different animal. It's so much quieter and the ride quality is vastly improved as are the materials used for the interior and soundproofing. This new Outlander is QUIET, the old 07 was noisey, tons of road noise and wind roar, virtually eliminated in this new 2016. Fuel economy is impressive, we are averaging a solid 27 combined and have seen as high as 32mpg while cruising open back-roads at 50-60mph.  Hopefully once it's broken in a bit the fuel economy will rise a bit as we are only getting about 27 on the highway at around 75mph. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is really nice, a bit muddy and punchy compared to my Mercedes E-350 but It's not really fair to compare a 60k vehicle to this, for the price point you would be hard pressed to do much better.  The exterior looks nice but to me  all crossovers look about the same, the 18"" alloy's are a nice touch though. The 2.4 motor coupled with the re-programmed CVT is lackluster but functional. I miss the power of the old 6cyl in the 07 but I don't miss the appalling fuel economy that came along with it. For our purposes the 2.4
 will be just fine and we have zero issue merging onto the expressway or overtaking. Comparing the two models the 2016 just blows the 07 out of the water, it's a huge improvement. As for comparing it to other crossovers, I just spent a day driving around in a 2017 Subaru Outback. The Outback was much more peppy and it's CVT more refined. Ride quality was better, it has a more substantial solid feeling as far as the suspension goes but road noise was about the same and the cabin was nothing to write home about, I think the Outlander is superior and more comfortable along with feeling significantly larger with a higher more commanding ride. Considering how much more the Outback sells for I am VERY happy with the Mitsubishi Outlander, it represents one hell of a bargain at $22k and if it holds up as well as our 07 we will be incredibly happy owners.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,David M., 09/11/2017,Great car. Except for mpg and resale value,2,"I purchased the Outlander for its supposedly great fuel economy and third row seats.  First of all, the good.  The vehicle in the SEL trim is luxurious and nicely put together.  The leather seats seem to be good quality and though the lumbar support is lacking they are reasonably comfortable.  Like most of today's vehicles, there is plenty of plastic on the inside but the fit and finish is nice, tight, and clean; a nice mix of chrome and leatherette.  The third row seat came in handy on more than one occasion.  You'll find other reviews stating that the third row is for emergencies only and those reviews are correct with regard to adults.  However, kids fit just fine and since kids are most likely to occupy a third row seat in any vehicle, I consider this a non-issue.  However, for infants and toddlers, though two car seats will fit in the third row and can be secured using the old fashioned seat belt technique (pull the seat belt all the way out until it starts clicking when you retract it), there aren't any car seat anchors or rear tethers and you aren't actually supposed to use the third row for car seats.  Handling is a little squishy and unlike my 2012 Chevy Equinox, seems tuned toward off-roading rather than sport.  Not a big deal to me.  Now on to the bad parts of this car.  First, the acceleration is sluggish.  You have to floor it if you want it to get up and go.  Not a huge problem since I drive like an old man and always choose fuel economy over horsepower.  Nevertheless, the slow acceleration is super-annoying when you are trying to merge in heavy traffic.  Next, the supposed fuel economy is no where close to reality.  Stated fuel economy is 23/29 for the AWD 4 cylinder.  Highway mileage has been about 29 mpg for me so I can't complain about that.  However, I average a disappointing 18 mpg in the city.  Since I do about 70% of my driving in the city, I find the 18 mpg to be a deal breaker.  Last but not least, resale value is TERRIBLE.  Just TERRIBLE.  I paid invoice for my SEL (a little less than $32,000 as I recall).  Eighteen months and only 11,600 miles later, two different dealerships offered me a measly $15,000 for my Outlander.  That's less than half of what I paid for it.  That's a $17,000 depreciation in LESS THAN two years.  I did take it to Carmax and was offered $18,000, but unless you're buying a car from them, you take the tax hit by not trading on your new car.  And that would still be a $14,000 loss in, again, LESS THAN two years.  In summary, if you're in the market for an 'OK' used car or just don't care about resale value, maybe the Outlander is for you.  Regardless, DO NOT buy it new and DO NOT buy it if you expect to get the stated fuel economy.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,PearlWhite, 05/10/2017,After a year still a pleasure!,5,"If looking for value and long term warranty this is it! Purchased 10/2015 new. Interior still looks new and easy to clean. Electronics easy to use with no issues. My wife is crazy in love with the sound system. Leather interior is nice. Second row seats are very spacious. Third row is tight but could be easily managed by adults for a short trip. The 4cyl engine is not fast but it's enough to merge even when loaded with passengers. The 4wd is excellent with several choices like snow-eco-lock. Exterior paint shines and no rock chips with 20k miles. We get about 30mpg hwy and about 25mpg city.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,sccjr51, 07/17/2019,16 outlander GT,4,"seriously, nice value for the dollar.  I needed a comfortable, good sized people mover and because i commute a TON, i needed something decent on gas and affordable (not expecting any car to last too long w/ my mileage).  purchased a used GT and love it.  granted it's neither; the fastest, best handling, largest, best MPG, but it's certainly a nice in the middle of everything on the market.  Car looks decent, I purchased the GT as i wanted to tow a small trailer and expect to fill the car w/ people so it's nice to have the additional capacity to carry.  I get in eco mode and in std AWC 4w drive about 25-27mpg on the highway.  One thing to note, the vehicle i purchased was built in Japan, not expecting any large defects, but one thing is the paint tends to be a little thin, so i'm accumulating a few nicks, scratches etc.  other than that, the leather interior, sunroof and electronics are all pleasing to me and the car has nice exterior lines.
If you're coming from a high end vehicle down, you'll notice a somewhat stiffer ride and sway at speed around corners, but you'll also enjoy spending about 10-15K less.  Doubtful i'd purchase the vehicle brand new, but that's just due to depreciation and value for any car.
don't listen to the experts, drive the thing!

Car continues to be just a great car.  Driving habits changed a bit, little more city routes, so mileage has dropped about .3 mgp or so.  Sure c an not complain.  Use regular fuel, not the premium stated for 'best performance'.  One of the best buys ever done.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,B. K., 04/09/2017,Experts have established their biases,5,"I was in the market for a new vehicle for my wife replacing a wonderful Mazda MPV we loved but after 11 years of wonder use it was time.  We shopped around and we found the 2016 Outlander for really attractive pricing and great options with the SEL model.  We drove to the nearest dealer an hour and a half away.   Before I going I went to the normal review site.  The 'Experts' seemed to have neutral to negative options.   It startled me.  Then I read glowing reviews from owners.   Quickly it was obvious that the 'Experts' with many of the so called leading review publications must suffer from established biases limiting their ability to have a fair, impartial or relevant view.  This still concerned me, but owners are the real experts, so I decide to make the trip.   We took the SEL for a drive and I wanted to see how it did especially on getting onto a 70 mph road.  As I turned right onto the ramp I focused on the traffic that I needed to merge into.   I thought to myself, gee this vehicle seems to be slow accelerating, so I looked down at the speedometer.  To my surprise I was already doing 70mph.  I guess the 'Experts' were expecting Porsche like performance from the Outlander vs what I experience, solid smooth and surprisingly good performance.   What impressed me the most was how quiet the cabin of the Outlander was.   This in fact is a part of the reason for it seeming to under perform.  There's little to no noise to indicate a highly rev'ing engine or whining transmission to make you to have a performance feel.  I guess Mitsubishi should do like some automakers by creating this sensation through the sound system.   We decided to purchase the Outlander.   With a drive back to our home with a rather challenging 4 mile mountain climb I thought to myself, we'll find out the Outlanders breeding.  The mountain is set to 65mph but most trucks are lucky to make it at 40-45.   We started up the mountain and concerned not to push a new vehicle beyond reasonable break in, I kicked of the cruise.  Without issue or pushing with a heavy foot the Outlander easily kept a 60-65mph pace even on the more difficult inclines.   The CVT transmission and engine combination out pace all my expectation.   I guess I should have had some of the 'Experts' along for the ride to have a real conversation and experience of what the Outlander is and can do.  Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the 'Experts' inabilities to understand that their biases are getting in the way of truly fair, impartial and accurate reviews.  Loving my Outlander every time I drive it and I don't feel the need to attempt to make it perform like a V6 or V8.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Josh, 07/17/2017,The SUV that checked all of the boxes,4,"I purchased a used 2016 Outlander ES AWD in February 2017 with just under 20K on it.  For the money I paid, there wasn't a better deal out there! I originally went looking at the Outlander Sport but quickly realized that with a young growing family, there just wasn't enough space in the Sport. The dealer suggested I check out the Outlander. I actually test drove a 2014 and found it was a doable option. When I found the 2016 I purchased I immediately fell in love. It checked all of the boxes I was looking for: AWD, Bluetooth, decent gas mileage, and space! The third row was the final check mark. It is a nice bonus to have in a pinch. Yes, it isn't the most comfortable third row seat but for what I need it for, it's a nice option. Is this SUV the most sporty or fastest? Absolutely not. However, for everyday driving and situations, this vehicle has plenty of power and get-up. Plus, you can't beat the 28mpg combined average I've been getting in a 7-passenger! The only reason it's not a five star rating, there are some options not on the ES trim level that I wish were there: automatic locking doors when in drive, backup cam, rear air vents. With that said I would definitely recommend checking out an Outlander if you are doing a search for a new SUV.

***UPDATE (1/17/18)*** Almost one year later and I would still say the same about the Outlander. I've put about 11,000 miles on it with zero complaints. Plus, I've now experienced an entire Michigan winter in the vehicle and can't say enough about the AWD abilities of the vehicle. Always felt in control and under control thanks to the S-AWC on the vehicle.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Sam, 12/27/2018,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander LS,5,"The gas mileage on this truck is the best I've ever had on a car plus the quiet cabin and the overall reliability can not be beaten. It is like getting the quality of Toyota without paying the price.  The only downside is the power of the engine especially when using the ECO mode, the engine tends to be weak. Third row seats are small but with the moving 2nd row seats, they can easily become comfortable.

The mileage is slightly lower than the advertised 32 or 33 mpg,, we average about 25+/- in the city and 27-30-31 on the highway..and we are frar from being an aggressive driver...Actually, the only drawback of owning a small SUV of this sort is the roadnoise at speeds over 65...I have replaced the factory tires with a good set of michelin tires, in which the road handling, driving comfort, and road noise was greatly improved.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,NH, 05/23/2017,very poor quality; horrible dealership service,1,"Our previous car was Outlander SUV Mitsubishi and we bought its new model in 8 years. WE MADE A MISTAKE!!! DO NOT BUY Mitsubishi, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THEIR SERVICE. There are other good companies and cars. The Mitsubishi quality of the car was horrible as well as its service.  Several cracks on the windshield appeared when the car did not have 500 miles. Visiting the  Mitsubishi dealership, I met other unsatisfied customers with the same problem on their brand new  Mitsubishi  cars. It is a waste of time to talk to Mitsubishi dealership or their management /Customer relations, Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. (888) 648-7820. I am surprised with service provided by Japanese. NOBODY CARES. They are interested only in money and their customers are just a source of their profit.

There were many minor but glaring faults that make me question how much road testing was done for this vehicle. Climate control was abysmal with no consistency in air temperature. It fluctuated from frigid to steamy humid constantly. Road noise was pronounced and overpowering, making long trips even more exhausting. They obviously never tested fitting a child seat in the rear because the latch clips were way too close together to get a solid mount. Cargo space was pathetic for the size of the vehicle. I fit more luggage in my Mazda 6 and nothing blocked the back window. The kids were much more crammed in this thing than in the Mazda 6 as well. You can't change the volume on the radio without brushing the touch screen and jacking up the settings. There is no auxiliary input and pairing with Bluetooth was a royal pain. The gas tank is tiny, restricting you to a maximum of 350-400 miles in perfect highway conditions. I'm glad I got to turn it in, good riddance.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,kmagman, 03/04/2017,Don't Overlook this SUV,5,"Just to be clear, I needed a car with these specifications and price point ... It was NEVER on my want list.  However, having said that, I bought this Mitsubishi Outlander GT because:  1.  It has a traditional 6 speed automatic, NOT a CVT (Contiunously Variable Torture).  2).  A very reliable and time tested V6.  3).  A squared-off cargo area that actually has very useful space ... in my case for 2 dog crates 4).  Easy entry and exit ... dealing with transporting senior citizens 5).  AWD .. a surprisingly sophisticated system with different mode selection 6).  Best in class ground clearance 7). Hill holding feature (awesome for urban areas with hills!)  7).  EXCELLENT headlight system 8).  EXCELLENT sound system and seamless handsfree connection with iPhone 8).  EXCELLENT seat heaters .  However, even the best vehicles have some CONS.  These are the things I don't like about the vehicle 1).  Very finicky automatic liftgate actuation ... on multiple occassions it baulks opening ... especially with key fob ... very annoying  and has a lock out feature if you make too many attempts ... MITSUBISHI, please make this feature more user friendly  2).  As for handling .... at least for me, there is too much body roll/bobbing on country roads.   I know I did not buy an Audi or BMW, but tighter handling would be better.  OVERALL - I give this vehicle very high marks and is a great VALUE.   I will keep for a very long tme.

Still a great car after 6 months.  Can get 30 gpm on long highway trips.
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Biff A., 07/26/2017,"Mitsubishi, not Mercedes",5,"Update:
After owning the car for a year and 12K miles, I would recommend the '16 Outlander to anyone looking for a compact SUV and 7 seats. The car is unparalleled in snowy weather, and is still a smooth drive at 70 MPH (eat your heart out Jeep owners). I can't think of a single other car this size that would get 34 MPG on a highway trip to Dulles Intl. airport that doesn't have some sort of electrical engine. The 4 cylinder engine still has enough  power to get you on the highway! This is still a new car, so I have yet to encounter any major mechanical issues. I will do my best to update this review if/when I do. 

I have owned this car for 6 months, and this is a summary of my experience. Do not compare this car to a Mercedes, as so many professional reviewers are in the habit of doing. I obtained my 2016 Outlander for just over 22,000USD brand new, which is over $10,000 less than other SUVs in its class, with the SAME exact feature set. It's shameful what other brands are charging, and the price gouging stops with Mitsubishi. Starting with the outside of the car, I adore the design, it's reminiscent of a Lexus RX series, but design is subjective. I bought the 4cyl model and it gets me 27MPG in inner-city daily driving, and over 30MPG on the highway (no I'm not exaggerating.) This car is roomy in the drivers' seat for a 6'1"" Male. I love the headroom, something other cars were lacking, and my knees can breathe as well. Many reviewers complain about the third row...this costs half as much as a Toyota Highlander, and goes twice as far on a tank of gas!! Those seats are intended for short adults or kids. I have taken teens and short adults on hour long road trips with no complaints. The only issue with the back seats is no ventilation, something Mitsubishi needs to work on, make sure you cool the car down before stuffing people back there. Kick the car into lock mode and it powers through snow. I had to go to work in 8 inches of snow (24/7 365 workplace) and this car drove right through it, I did not get stuck while driving in the tracks of other trucks. This car is a comfortable ride for a crossover SUV. It is not a Lincoln, or a Mercedes, but it IS loaded with features such as power windows and heated leather seats, it costs less than a Honda Accord and comes with more utility. The warranty length is fantastic (5-year/60K mile full vehicle, 10-year/100K mile powertrain). The lights work very well and LED DRLs are standard. Fog lights were a must for me and those are effective as well. If you want a car to carry you and a few others year round, that can be packed to the gills with either people or stuff on occasion, this should definitely be on your test drive list.

mitsubishi,outlander,2016,Jerry B, 08/29/2017,This is best $$$ value by far,5,"If you need rear AC.... Then look elsewhere. If you want a great economical safe and dependable SUV.... Then this is by far the best. The complaint about the backseat is garbage.. Truth is... All 3 rows adjust to make room. We needed 3 rows on occasion.. Gas mileage is awesome... We realize 32 mpg.... Loaded with 5 people and gear.  Get the roof rack option. I didn't... And ended up buying it later.  Rubber mats are necessary for black interior. 2 problems with car... 1st the sun visor lacks extension. 2nd...air vents for rear is under seats only. That's it. 21k Otd for a GREAT CAR!

The wheels are definitely more beautiful than anything comparable and it is so fun to drive around and zip around the city/region. Mine is quarts brown like a Mocha color and I love it. The car still drives sporty in eco mode and is way more economical than Toyota or Honda options for the same Japanese quality. I had a Mitsubishi Montero Sport previously in addition to my Outlander. After also owning Hondas and Nissan - I am a loyal Mitsubishi customer. People really should realize more the value of buying a Mitsubishi!
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Jason K., 02/07/2017,Exactly what I was looking for in a low-cost daily,5,"Update (8/8/17): I've driven this car over 10,000 miles now, performed multiple oil changes which are comparatively easy, taken her on a 3,000 mile road trip through the mountains and down the coast of California, and loaded plenty of cargo she probably wasn't designed to haul (brick, wood, etc.).  She's handled it all like a champ with a few exceptions.  First, the trip panels over the roof mounted seat belt and other miscellaneous interior trim pieces are easy to knock out of place and rather difficult to fit back in.  Second, if you store anything in the hidden storage compartment, you have no access to it unless you're not hauling cargo.  Third, with the 60% middle seat folded flat, the cargo storage area between the front seats only opens part way.  These are all tiny complaints but good to know, nonetheless.

New things I've found that I love are as follows: With the back seat cushions folded up (step 1 in folding them flat) but leaving the seat-back in place, the indents are a perfect place to transport a propane tank and you can even strap it in with the belt.  It's almost like Mitsubishi wanted it that way, it's fantastic.  I transport 2 tanks at a time to the propane store with no worries about getting the upholstery dirty or the tanks damaging bits in the back while rolling around.  Second thing is that if you move the front passenger seat all the way forward, remove the head rest, and recline the seat all the way back, then fold the 2nd row seat-back down (skip step 1, folding the cushion up), it creates a 2 foot by 8 foot area to transport 8 foot long lumber.  It still won't haul a 4x8 sheet of plywood but it'll handle 2x8 strips and any 8 foot lumber I can fit in there and that's fine with me.

Original Review (2/7/2017): I knew going to the dealership what the pros and cons were of this vehicle but I desperately needed to replace my 15 year old daily driver with something better.  I weighed the options and considering that this is the 3rd car in our driveway and didn't need many bells or whistles, so I chose the ES model for its overall value.  I truly enjoy driving this car everyday and it does exactly what it's supposed to do, get me from point A to point B with zero issues or worries.  She's a very nice looking SUV, has plenty of room for cargo, drives perfectly sound and true, isn't to loud, handles the elevation changes like a champ, and is very comfortable including in/egress.  The trip computer is nice but sometimes a little goofy as is the radio but it's nice that it has a 6.1"" touchscreen with bluetooth standard, not many cars include that in the lowest trim level.  I got a great deal on the car with the help of a pre-approval from my finance company and I've gone from filling the tank once a week with premium fuel to filling it once every two weeks with mid-grade fuel.  I'm very aware that many people will have complaints about little things but as I said initially, the total value and amenities provided by my Outlander are exactly what I was looking for in a tidy and attractive package.  Ownership level: 2+ months; purchased in November 2016; review written 2/7/2017

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Minnesota Driver, 05/04/2017,Great value for money - ignore the expert reviews,5,"I own this car and bought it after very extensive research and months of test driving cars. I drove both the 2.4 and 3.0 version, settled on the GT with touring package. I have previously owned Saab's, Audi's and still own a Honda. There is just no comparison of value for money - I fit three kids in the 2nd row, and yes the third row is smaller than my Honda Pilot, but manageable for the few days per year I really need it. Safety features are outstanding and work in real life driving. Ok, it doesn't drive at the same level as some of the new BMW/Acura/Mercedes models I tested - but realistically I am getting 90% of what I would utilize from those cars for 50% of the price. For my daily commute and moving kids around to and from school and weekend road trips this is an amazing car. I recommend people to actually research AND test drive this car - many people will find it surpasses most of the competition in value, performance, comfort!

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,John Ho, 12/15/2017,"Zen to drive, Zen to own.",5,"We test drove everything in and near the compact to midsize SUV segment and were surprised and most impressed by the Outlander and bought it after test driving everything else from the Rogue to the all new Tiguan.  
1yr Update: We still could not be more pleased to be driving the Outlander SEL AWC. No regrets, not one. Every part of this review still holds up, about 1 year later. 
Update: 2 years later-> Everything we’ve stated still holds true. This is a awesome vehicle. If I had one item for Mitsubishi to improve, it would be using thicker glass for the windshield, which seems to attract chips. 

*Maintenance costs are very very low. We dealer maintain our Outlander and the service is highly personal, with no stress.

It fits:
It's a really functional size, has good visibility, and gets 25-30mpg consistently which makes it great for commuting and being the family car. It's a car you like to spend time in. It shuts out the traffic and drama =zen.

The quality: The Outlander really showed a pride in craftsmanship and engineering that was steps above the rest. It is quiet, relaxing, well built/thought out, and is very sure footed. 

Engine: On paper, 166 hp doesn't seem like it'd be enough but the transmission does an incredible job of putting the power to all 4 wheels and it actually felt faster than many of the 200hp + vehicles we test drove in our search. 70 mph mergers are no sweat.
The Outlander is light while being sure footed and has a very strong chassis made from a proprietary Mitsubishi Steel alloy and you can feel it.
The Outlander being a 2017 IIHS Top Safety Pick was icing on the cake and piece of mind.

The cvt transmission: is shift point free in auto mode, very smooth, and absent of the delays in acceleration found in transmissions with gears. It reminded us of the LEAF. It keeps the engine in the powerband and isn't limited by set ratios. Tap the shifter over and it will hold the ratio and rpm which is great when it’s loaded up with 7 people and you are merging or off-roading.

The Outlander's 4wd system is simply incredible and keeps the Outlander in control in the snow/ice without drama. 
Off-road, this thing is very very capable. I took it up a loose gravel 40% grade at a crawl and it just went up it without pause even getting one wheel off the ground from a rut! On the stock all-season toyo tires! Impressive.

Interior usability is good: The 2nd row seats slide and adjust and are great for car seats. We keep the third row folded down mostly (it disappears into the floor) but if you are under 5'11"" it's actually pretty comfortable. You can put two child seats in the middle and left side leaving the right middle row seat open for access to the third row. You can also put 5 high back boosters in the 2nd and 3rd rows without much drama as well should the occasion arise. 
 The engine had way less plastic engine parts than the Nissans, Toyotas, or especially the VW which the entire front engine was plastic)
This is the stuff that degrades after 120k miles... ya know, out of warranty.

This is a well built vehicle that is fun and relaxing to live with everyday. We still love it 2 years on!

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,J Harvey, 08/02/2017,Severely Underrated and a Tremendous Value,5,"After much research I narrowed my choices to a Subaru Forester XT Touring and a Mitsubishi Outlander GT.  They both seem to have the best AWD systems in their class.  My first choice was the Subaru, especially coming from a 2013 XV Crosstrek, but I couldn't justify the additional expense over the Mitsubishi.  The biggest advantages the Forester had over the Outlander were steering feel/handling and resale value.  However, I prefer the Outlander's traditional 6 speed automatic over the Forester's CVT.  I also find the front seats to be more comfortable.  The Outlander's build and material quality is top notch.  I haven't found one flaw.  Engine performance is strong and the fuel economy has been surprisingly good.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  You really can't beat the value here for what is truly a quality vehicle with excellent safety ratings and best in class warranty coverage.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Will Deal, 04/27/2017,Real Review,3,"I purchased the 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SEL trim with the SAWC. It's a 4 cyl, and that part of the deal makes the vehicle light on performance. It's got this grind when taking off from a dead stop if you're on the gas, and in my honest opinion its just slow. The vehicle does offer a lot of bang for the buck, but not in the performance department. It is a stylish vehicle and i like that. The tech is outstanding! You'd pay a lot more cash for many of the standard options that come with the vehicle. If I had to do it over again I would not buy the 4 cly, I'd get the V6 hands down which is about 4-5G more. That may have come down some since I purchased mine back in December 2016. Oh, the paint is another problem. You will get paint chips when you first hit the road. I have the cosmic blue and the paint chipping stands out like a soar thumb. I plan to buy the hood protector, but Mitsubishi could have done a much better job with the paint coat, at least for the hood area. Trust me that issue really ticks me off. Like others have commented it is a very nice vehicle for the money, but look around before you buy this vehicle. I would recommend the vehicle to anyone is looking for nice standards, reasonable cost, outstanding warranty and a great stereo system this car get's five stars in those categories. Mostly everything else is about middle of the road, and performance is not great.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,norfla71, 08/19/2017,"I agree; do not listen to paid ""expert"" reviews.",4,"Just bought mine last night; traded out of a 2017 Jetta S and what a difference! Frankly, I wanted the Outlander first but got a better deal on the VW;  however, a good deal is not that good if you can't live with the car daily. We needed something bigger for road trips and box store runs that would fit a family of 4 and 2 dogs. After 3 days (2 night test drive included) we are over the moon, as they say. Had I listened to any number of negative reviews, rather than reading actual, real world owner reviews, we would have paid several thousand more for much less vehicle. The pros are awesome MPG (averaging over 35 combined, but I drive to keep the tree green), lengthy standard features list (especially in SEL trim, which is why it we chose it over a cheaper SE), comfort (front seats, ride, NVH; my 7 mile old Jetta already had a nasty rattle in the driver's door that no dealer could fix), great ingress and egress, very good infotainment system (base system rocks; IMO not worth upgrading to the optional system), easily garage -able and very good value for the dollar. The cons are mostly nit-picking; that smaller size limits interior space. However, we bought it knowing that 3rd row was not going to be used, and needed more space than the Sport model had (Sport also cannot tow, and we need that capability). It lacks all the current active safety features, which are included only in an expensive package. At least BSM and RCW should be standard. The camera lines do not turn unless, again, you upgrade to that expensive package, which included 360 surround. You have to take your eyes off the road to scroll through SXM folders as the wheel control will only scroll through what's on the current folder. Finally, there needs to be more info available in the dash. Even basic vehicles these days come with a minimal TFT screen, and it would be nice to see what's playing on the radio or what speed my CC is set at. Overall, as another review said, this is an undiscovered gem in a crowded market. I'm hopeful the Nissan really infuses some cash into this brand, and can't wait to see what the next gen will look like (though it will, most likely, also compete in a higher price bracket, taking another affordable option off the market).

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Lprima, 01/24/2018,Most under rated SUV,5,"Update**  I have owned my Outlander now for over two and a half years and I still LOVE it!!!  I would absolutely buy another one and was tempted with a 2020 at the Mistubishi dealer!  Ha!  The one thing I thought it really needed was AC/Heat control in the back seat and they have actually added it now!  We drive to NC quite a bit and back from CT and it is a breeze!  So comfortable- Cannot wait until I can get a newer one!  And then maybe I will have two!  Or get the  Eclipse Cross!

I absolutely love my car! I purchased it at the end of November 2017. It's only been two months but I feel like I drive a luxury vehicle for almost half the price!! The dealership is outstanding! I had a leased Mazda CX-5 and the Outlander blows it away! And I pay $15 more a month and I own it! I liked the Mazda CX-9 but never drove it as I was not paying almost 50k for a car. I stumbled upon the Outlander and I was very pleasantly surprised! Yes the third row is only really for kids. I had to sit back there once but we didn't pull the middle seat up. If we had, I think I would have been fine. And the acceleration is great. Don't listen to that review. It has a sport mode. If you want an extra kick just push it over to your ""S"" mode! It has great pick up with this mode. So so many features. I have the premium package but basic comes with pretty good features. The car even has snow mode for the SAWD and lock mode for more blizzard conditions, Apple car play, leather. It's endless!!! Don't be fooled by Mazda when they say they are the only ones with blind spot monitoring because the Outlander has it. The safety features and warnings are awesome! The side mirrors fold in - press a button if you want to do it when you park or it does it when you lock it. It's crazy!!! Sticker was 30k. I had some negative equity and I literally financed 29k. Absolutely do not look past this SUV! Even if your dealer is a little far away. It is totally worth it for only two - yes two oil changes per year!!! A++ now go buy it!

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Rick, 06/12/2017,Great Value,5,"My wife and I were looking for a third row SUV and were shocked at the sticker prices on most of them.  I had previously owned a Mitsubishi Lander and loved it so we decided to check out the Outlander.  After some negotiating we got the SEL for what they were asking for the ES and it was a deal to good to pass up. This is now my wife's everyday car and out family car on the weekends and we couldn't be happier.  While the four cylinder does lack the get up you'd like in an SUV the MPGs more than makes up for it.  We get 30+ MPG on any interstate trip; It feels like weeks between fill ups, and as much as we drive that's saying something.  The push button start and keyless entry means looking fooling with keys is a thing of the past.  My biggest complaint is the lack of places to put stuff like my phone.  Most vehicles have nooks or something to put your items in, they forgot about that when designing it.  All and all we couldn't be happier.  We would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an SUV who isn't looking to tow anything.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Glenn M., 12/20/2017,Great Vehichle and Overlooked,5,"2017 Mitsubishi Outlander is one of those mid-sized SUV that most overlooked. Took home a new 2017 Outlander over a week now and so far I'm very pleased with the purchase. I've had driven multiple SUV's in the past and its a must to have an AWD/4WD here in the US northeast part of the United States. One of the best decisions I've made this year has to be purchasing one of the Outlander and glad to get rid of the 2017 Jeep Cherokee only driving the vehicle just over 2 months. I did own a 2015 Highlander (great SUV, terrible in gas mileage), 2016 Crosstrek (too small and not much power) both love these SUVs but I needed something affordable and at the same time have the luxury feeling and performance of a V6. The Outlander is pretty affordable and have the looks and the ""techie"" stuff inside. Also, the warranty is one of the best out there with 10/100000 miles coverage. Highly recommend the Outlander to those seeking affordable and reliable SUV. The only complaint I have at this time is the 3rd row seat does not have much leg room, but if you just have more than 3 kids then that wouldn't be an issue because my sons just love to sit in the 3rd row and they seem pretty satisfied with it.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Michael Lacy, 03/22/2018,Had em all,4,"I have had CRV EX-L , Legacy sedan, Toyota 4-runner Limited, and now the 2017 Outlander GT.  Pound for pound it wins hands down.. Great ride, smooth engine, 24-31 mpg depending on the type of driving.  Do not listen to those asinine reviews stating how it doesn't stop like a M-5 Bimmer, handles softer than Corvette etc.  They are correct because it is just a very nice, smooth, nice handling and quiet underrated SUV.  My wife has a Lexus GS-350 AWD and believe me she loves driving this Outlander.  Couldn't get her in the 4-runner only under duress. The only thing I don't like is the power lift gate.  I've on 20K on it and still can't get used to it.  Acts like it has a mind of it's own.  As soon as the warranty is gone I most likely get another GT.  It is well worth it.  Remember it's built in Japan so the quality is there!

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,JD, 03/25/2018,“Expert” reviews miss the point,5,"Until a week ago I had never driven a Mistsubishi, let alone own one.  After owning the 2017 Outlander SEL for a week, I think I’m a customer for life.  Seriously, ignore the so called expert reviews.  They point to things like acceleration and inadequacy of the engine and fuel economy.  What they don’t realize is that most people aren’t using this car to drag race with.  For the normal everyday family, this car can’t be beat.  It’s whisper quiet, gets amazing fuel economy, and drives smoother than any car or suv I have ever owned.  I don’t even know what side of the car the gas tank is on because I haven’t had to fill it up yet.  It’s easily the best bang for your buck.  It feels much more expensive than it is.  It has awesome features like awd, Apple CarPlay, heated seats, etc.  It’s also very nimble and fun to drive.  I would recommend this car to anyone.
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Evan, 12/08/2018,Best SUV for the Money,5,"I have two 2017 Outlanders and I have had not any issues or need for warranty work on either.  The Outlander is made in Japan with mostly Japanese parts and the build quality is apparent.  After about 1.5 years of regular use, I have no annoying rattles and everything works great.  Contrary to what professional reviews say, the 4cyl CVT w/ AWC is a very good powertrain for a dairly driver.  The S-AWC gives amazing control in all weather conditions.  The S-AWC gives the driver a lot of options between ECO, normal, snow and even 4 wheel lock.  Additionally, the transmission also has an ECO button which helps save even more gas, so yes there is an ECO AWD mode with an ECO setting on top of it.   You do need to push the 4 cyl somewhat when you need accelerate fast, but it’s not an issue.  Engaging the CVT in sport mode makes the performance much more lively and keeps the engine in the power band.  I’ts fun driving around in Sport mode.  The engine and transmission work seamlessly together and are extremely well built.  There are no hard clunks and everything works seemlessly.  I have driven this SUV in some pretty deep snow and icy roads with no issues.  The S-AWC gives you a lot of confidence in hazardous road conditions.  The Outlander is easy to drive and maneuver around town and makes a great commuter car.   Fuel mileage, especially in ECO mode is fantastic. I get 31 plus on the highway and 25 mpg overall.  The third row is tight but it’s great to have when you have extra occupants.  I almost always have the third row folded down with gives you an impressive amount of space.  Mitsubishi backs this card with a huge warranty.  In short, this is a great product, at a great price that offers a lot of versatility for a family on a budget.  The Japanese build quality is excellent.  There are not of ton of these so you stand out a bit too.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Josh07-ATL, 02/03/2018,Should be rated at least 'A',5,"Update 8/2020: I keep loving my Outlander. It's always been reliable, dependable and low maintenance. Very satisfied with this car since we bought it. No complain whatsoever!

Update: My 2017 Outlander has gone super strong, and very reliable. No issues whatsoever; the only expenses were for the scheduled maintenance. On the interstate, we easily got 34-36 mpg. We don't need a SUV with a big engine, which unnecessarily increases our spending on gas. 

I have owned a 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander with 33K miles on it. This car is indeed a hidden gem! It handles great on the road, not to mention that the acceleration is decent and reasonable for a car with V4 engine, not like what so-called experts say 'kind of sluggish'. I owned and drove many different  makes and models in the past, including Honda, Toyota, Mazda, KIA, Hyundai, Ram and Ford. Mitsubishi and Ford are the best cars I have driven thus far. My Outlander drives so smooth on the Interstate, and very quite - the level of road noise is much better than Mazda or Honda. Also, once a while we need a couple of extra seats for a short trip. The fact that Mitsubishi Outlander comes with a third row seating, it serves our purposes. Overall, I've been completely satisfied with the way this car performs.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,New Mitsu Fan, 11/25/2017,New Owner Outlander,5,"Coming from loaded high end Murano to basic level Outlander was tough for about a day.  Budget drove me to look at the Outlander.  All the consumer reviews were pretty good, so I pulled the trigger.  Once I got past the more luxury aspect,  all is good.  For half the price of the Nissan,  cannot be happier now.  For a 4 cylinder I am amazed, cruises at 80 smoothly and still has acceleration, up mountain roads at 75 no problem.  Tight solid feel in the cockpit.  Leg space was only glitch for me, my big leg rests against the console, just have to deal  with that. For practical around towner and possible trips to the trailheads with lots of cargo space, giant warranty, and in 20k range, no brainer.  Sales folks were great, no bs.....I hate buying cars and this was not that painful, very happy with purchase.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,New Mitsubishi Fan, 01/11/2018,"Safe, good looking, roomy, gas saver and affordabl",5,"The value for money in this SUV is incredible. Pro’s where to start? 
Road visibility is great, the safety features are also awesome, super All Wheel Control is impressive and you really feel confident driving on snow or mud great on fuel, apple car play work's great, this is top safety pick and you really feel it when driving it, huge warranty with roadside assistance, you have a very decent cargo space with the 3rd row folded down but if for a reason you have to transport 7 passengers it is good to know that you have that possibility this is a efficient family hauler, not a sports car,. We are getting 29 – 31 MPG. The CVT transmission is not designed for aggressive drivers, but for those who drive sensibly. I can't believe I don't see more on the road, for the $$ hard to beat... Highly recommended SUV
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Tim J Ciulla, 11/30/2018,Excellent value,5,"If the Outlander had Honda or Toyota badge on it the critics would rave about it. From a value perspective I don’t know that there is a better deal. It’s well made, efficient and meets a lot of boxes of need and some of the wants. It’s a value buy. And a great job in quality for price and excellent for overall balance. If your looking for luxury or sporty performance look elsewhere. But for most families this hits the mark for most of our needs and some of the wants!  Nice fit.  And truthfully, the whole “rear seat is too small thing” is a bad argument. What adults are ever going to sit in the back for a long period anyway?  Do you know any families with 7 adults?  Yeah...
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Ibrahim, 11/20/2017,There should be more on the road!!,5,"Was on the market for 3 row SUVs with good gas mileage. We wanted the 3rd row only few times a year when our extended family visits us, so we did not really care about the 3rd row leg room. Like others say, the value for money in this SUV is incredible. This is what I would pay for other sedans. Remember this is a efficient family hauler, not a sports car, nor is it a SUV loaded with unnecessary creature comforts. I am a hypermiler, and if are one, this is the SUV for you. I always clock 31 + mpg on the gallon when I drive. The CVT transmission is not designed for aggressive drivers, but for those who drive sensibly. When others drive my car with a heavy braking/ acceleration, they got 25-26 combined mpg. Road visibility is great, the safety features are also awesome. I have lived in the middle east where Mitsubishi Pajero's (Montero) are legendary. I see that Mitsubishi has integrated some of its class leading AWD (they call it is Super All Wheel Control) into this SUV. Other awesome factors (84 month 0% finance, 10 year powertrain warranty + lifetime powertrain warranty from dealer, etc) made this a no-brainer buy. Remember that this is a unique class in itself (bigger than the RAV4's/ Tuscon/ CRV/ Rogue) but smaller that the Highlanders/ Pathfinders/ Traverse; which is why some of the experts confuse themselves while reviewing this SUV).

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,treva, 01/01/2018,Stylish and Performance built into one Mitsubishi,5,"At first, I thought I could not afford this car...I stopped in to take a test drive...and i was super impressed with all the awesome features!  I compared and test drove other models like Chevrolet Trax and Ford Edge.  The superior fuel economy and drive train warranty helped seal the deal.  I have had the chance to drive it in off road conditions as well....very smart handling.  The passenger capability of handling my whole family and all our luggage, and snacks while we went on vacation without sacrificing any comfort was probably what impressed me the most.  The basic car also has the high end features like blue tooth built in. The seats are nice, but i would have recommended the rear seats be adjustable as well.

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Raja, 04/28/2020,A Hidden Japanese Secret!,5,"5 Stars in Reliability, Dependability, Safety, Performance, Design, Warranty, Features and Price.  Nissan are part owners of Mitsubishi and they revised this car for 2016.  It has the same transmission as the Rogue made by JATCO.  It has a Japanese Engine built and made in Japan.  The top 4 cylinder model has the power like of a V6 when mated to the most up to date new generation CVT transmission.  It has a 10 YR\100K Mile Powertrain ,5 YR\60K Mile New Vehicle Limited, 7 YR\100K Mile Anti-corrosion Warranty and a 5 YR\Unlimited Mile Roadside Assistance Warranty.  It has received a 5 Star IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus Crash test award in all categories.  The Super All-Wheel Control AWD can almost handle any terrain capable for it's design and has auto sensing capabilities with 8.5 inches of clearance.  The top luxury 4 cylinder SEL model has options and features at a very affordable price as a new or used car.  This is a dream car.  My wife loves this car.  I had a chance to drive 3 hours from the NJ dealer to NY and it was really fun to drive.  The Outlander 4 cylinder feels like a V6 and I have driven a V6 for a long time and you can't tell the difference at times.  The engine is quiet at drive, but when accelerating to get speed it revs just like any other engine and goes quiet.  The CVT almost feels like driving an electric motor with it's acceleration without hard shift points.  This car is also a 7 Seater which the seats are adjustable to the passengers who are sitting in it by adjusting and sliding the  2nd row seats forward or back to get the extra leg room.  The car is never boring to look at and would look similar to a Lexus when the badge is removed.  The Outlander has also won the award for winning design concept by the Chicago Athenaeum: Museum of Architecture and Design.  I love the center console design on the 2017 models and above which makes the cabin upscale with an electric parking brake.  There is a spare tire located underneath the trunk area outside of the car.  This vehicle is truly a value and getting popular as we speak. Just look at the user reviews on every website and you will see that this car is a hidden treasure to own.  We love this car. - Model - 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SEL with Premium Package.
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2017,chris ghengeaua, 07/26/2018,don't buy this brand,1,"i've owned two (both V6 models...bought brand new from their dealers..2016 and 2017).  reliability is horrible...i though ""made in japan"" is the way to go....but to my surprise it's been very bad. Components failing, assembly issues, poor design. I lost the brakes while driving ...pretty scary. ABS pump was leaking and took air into the brake system....brakes got soft out of nowhere. Brake fluid leaked all over the engine bay and sub frame....peeled off all the paint. Took alot to get brakes fixed but all paint damage was ignored. Mirror broke, interior parts started squeaking and rattling (no offroad driving). All doors started getting stuck or misaligned. Too many issues to describe.  Based on my experience dealing with Mitsu USA,  the company has such a small foot print in the states that they don't quite have the financial resources to back up their flashy warranties (10 years)....they don't have the financial backing of a big company with large funds...and that comes through in all the dealings a customer would have with them....from the sale staff, to financing to service and warranty claims....to the quality of the product itself. At all steps , you feel like you're dealing with a mom/pop business....very low grade....as if the company can't afford any better.   As far as warranty and repairs,if it is not a minor issue, they do not even what to hear about it. So between a subpar product and crappy service, one should look else where. I live in a large city and the local dealer has one service rep and one mechanic. Imagine having to have major repairs done there.   i wanted something different than the usual honda and toyota....but i found out first hand why this brand is almost disappearing  from this market....their products are not in the same league as the ones from the other more famous manufacturers. I was ridiculed when i chose this car by friends and coworkers.....now i can't argue for it anymore.   I wanted reliability...i did not get it...not even close. Other details on this car: in city driving, i was never able to average above 15 mpgs (on either v6 cars) ...driving with EXTREME light acceleration. I used regular gas (87) after testing the car for a few months with premium....no difference in acceleration or fuel economy (or any improvement in engine harshness). I believe under a heavier foot, the car would burn gas even more. Winter times (miami) with ac off , fuel economy 15 or worse. Cruising on highway....19.5 to 20 mpg average (with or without cruise control). I've had one car for 15000 miles and the other one currently has 2500 miles....neither has ever seen average fuel economy better than 20 mpg....EVER....regardless of gas used, eco mode or not, ac on or not. i've had oil changed on average every 3000 miles (every time i was in the shop with issues)....did not make a difference on fuel economy.   V6 is very slow unless...you shift gears manually and almost floor it....than is pretty fast and sounds much better than any 4 cyl.   Transmission is tuned for fuel economy...and engine is low in torque. This combines for dangerously slow vehicle. All this at sea level...i can't even imagine a customer up in the mountains.  No vents in rear seats is a huge issue in south florida....i've added ultra dark tints on windows to try and mitigate weak rear ac..but there is no substitute for actual . interior is quiet if you keep it under 80 mph.....large side mirrors get noisy at high speed.   Suspension is very floaty....80 mph cruise on a highway that is less than perfect is very scary...car bounces and shifts weight around making it difficult to keep in lane..at speed car requires your full attention...tall , narrow and floaty.  Long highway drives are tiresome for that reason. Suspension set up is good in the city... soaks up bumps ok at low speed. Sound system is pretty great...more quantity than quality but
 for the price is pretty good. Sound system is what sold me the car (also good financing terms).  Both V6 cars had a weird ""hesitation"" at idle when at a stop light....as if the engine was choking....though it was a defect with the car, but both of them did it , regularly. Idle at 600-700 rpms than followed by a sudden drop of a few hundread rpms...jolts the entire car...as if the engine stalled for a second.  This was extremely frequent....in both cars...all the time. Engine would never stop so i learned to live with it.  Did it just the same when running the recommended premium gas. there were lots of recalls with the car but that's with all brands nowadays...just an inconvenience having the car in the shop for days.  From a technology point of view, the car is years behind the competition...engine performance, fuel economy, handling, active safety. Active safety in this car is just a marketing tool....they don't really work...just little trinkets added to an aging car...not really well integrated into the car's systems. Thirsty v6 under powered by 4 cyl standards .

mitsubishi,outlander,2017,Mike, 10/30/2017,Not worth the money,1,"We have 8,000 miles on the vehicle and so far have already received 2 recall notices from Mitsubishi Motors. The first one for faulty door latch components and just got another yesterday for defective relays involving the engine control unit. If the relay fails the engine will stall while driving and cannot be restarted. If the relay for the engine valve lift control fails, it limits the available engine power. If the relay for the radiator fan fails, the engine may overheat. We brought a vehicle that we thought we could rely on and with the recalls we are now in doubt. Because there are no local dealers in our area we have to drive 4 hours for a 1/2 repair or more to have the recalls taken care of. I'm disappointed in the reliability and lack of dealers. For the time we have to spend driving and the expense to get the recalls taken care of we do not feel that this vehicle is right for us and do not think I would recommend this vehicle to someone else.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Michael, 08/20/2018,Why the press hates these cars is beyond me,5,"My family has bought 5 of these cars (so far) a few Outlander Sports, and I have bought 2 Outlanders myself. This is the only vehicle on the market that can seat 6 or 7 people, has all-wheel drive and gets better than 30mpg. These are the criteria I use to make a vehicle purchase. The 10 year warranty (7 years beyond everyone else's) is an awesome plus. I routinely get 32 mpg driving around coastal Maine, and the only vehicle with a better AWD system is a Range Rover (which will set you back about 3x what this thing costs!). We live in Maine, where we have ice, snow, and slush 5 months a year, and a majority of people's houses are down long, un-paved driveways. This is the only car that has yet to get itself stuck! The S-AWC system keep the thing on the road really well, and adds a significant amount of control in everyday driving. The 3rd row seat IS tight, but I can ride back there in a pinch, and my wife and my kid can do so with no issues, and it is temporary! This is not a Caravan, or a Suburban, but for the 4 or 5 times a year when we really need to carry a bunch of people it is perfect. A far bigger impact is the fuel economy, which comes into play every time you start it- there is nothing on the road (that is not an EV) that can touch this car for efficiency. If the performance/acceleration of this thing bothers you, you should buy a sports car, not a mid-sized SUV. This thing has plenty of performance unless you need to drive like a moron, I have yet to get into a drag race with a Nissan Rogue or a CR-V, and my masculinity would survive if I did. This is not the fastest car in it's class, but it is the best. Your rational choice should outweigh whatever rubrik the automotive press uses to describe this type of car. Anyone who owns one of these will sing it's praises, and that should tell you something!

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Mac Jt, 10/11/2018,"Beware of ""professional reviews"" this car is a gem",5,"Like the heading, beware of so called expert reviewers who for some reason bash this car. The truth is this car is an underappreciated gem. I returned my leases car a year ago and a new job got me looking at new cars. I'm not into luxury cars so looked at Subaru Outback and the Outlander. The Subaru drove better but in terms of value for money the Outlander blew all competition out of the water. I really love this car, bought the highest trim for 25k and as of today cant say anything wrong with it. It drives smoothly, very intuitive entertainment system, handles the road well. It is true that the acceleration isnt all that great,but I'm not going to race anytime soon. The car I got has power liftgate, blind spot monitor and rear sensor all included. Unlike the other Japanese cars dont forget this one is 100% made in Japan so the workmanship is definitely good. So far no regrets. BTW im getting 27 miles to the gallon in the city!

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,SoCalMark, 06/19/2018,"Mitsubishi, the ""diamonds"" in the rough winner",5,"I was extremely skeptical of this vehicle and after so much research was heading to the Honda CRV instead. My wife has a friend that is a salesperson for a Mitsubishi store and after I test drove this vehicle I was not thrilled about it --- but now that I own one, it was the best decision I ever made. This car is loaded with technology features (although I have not gotten Android Auto to work with the vehicle yet at all). I was shocked that 'Car and Driver' gave this vehicle such a low score on handling and comfort. I had a Ford Escape before this and the Outlander is extremely wonderful to drive long distance with. I read one woman's review of the back seats and granted there isn't much space back there this should not be compared to a full-size SUV. If you want a full-size SUV then pull out your wallet and pay for one and stop your griping, this car isn't presented as this. U-turns are so simple and the vehicle sips gas very slightly. This is an awesome road trip vehicle to have with the family and as a soccer coach, I find the back with plenty of space for all our gear. One of the things that steered me to Mitsubishi is that I make several trips to the Philippines and in this country, vehicle maintenance on a regular basis is scarce and yet I see Mitsubishi cars and trucks that have enormous amounts of mileage on them and they just keep running compared to their Toyota counterparts that are falling apart. I love this vehicle and it feels and looks like any of the top end SUV's out there. Get the side windows tinted and you will be happy with the look and feel of the interior too.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,William Anderson, 07/11/2018,Beats Cadillac SRX at half the price!,5,"I just bought a 2018 Outlander. This car is an unbelievably great value. I had a Cadillac SRX before I got a 2016 Outlander in August of 2016. The Outlander looked good, but too good, so I leased it, figuring I'd get out of it if it went bad. It was half the price of getting another CRX! It was a great car! It was a little slow off the starting line, not an acceleration star, but I'm over needing that these days. It had plenty enough acceleration when I floored it when I needed it, like merging into speeding commuters on the highway. My soulmate loved it, said it wasn't any different from the CRX, ride, quiet and comfort-wise. It's a great quiet cabin, smooth and easy ride. The gas mileage was a big improvement, 28 on my commute, and 32 on a trip. My gas bill went down by 50% (I suppose not sprinting off at every light like I did with the Caddy had something to do with that.) I was so pleased with that car that I just got the 2018 version when the lease ran out. The new one is even better! I'm just learning the about new features -- blind spot alarm, auto-lights, 360 degree cameras (It gives a bird's eye view), great sound system with Apple play, I don't even know everything that's new, but it's great. Looks better too, nice accents. This is a great car at the best price for the best features of all comparable SUVs. And the dealer was excellent too. No monkey business, no games, no time-wasting ""stories"". They gave me the honest right price right off the bat (I've had a little experience with the business and this is my 23rd vehicle purchased for my own use). The service I got from the dealership during the 3 year lease was extraordinary too. My experience buying 23 cars over the years had me thinking bad thoughts about the dealerships and their people, but this dealership convinced me we still have professional and honest people with integrity in this business. The dealership is Sarasota Mitsubishi. --- William Anderson, LMHC, Sarasota, Florida

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Kandi Yams, 03/17/2018,2018 Outlander SEL,5,"I own a 2004 Mitsubishi Galant ES and I have had it now for 14 years, my son was 2 when I got it and now he will be 16 in 3 months. I was planning on getting him a used car but then decided my credit was good and I could get a brand new car and give him the Galant. I wasn’t planning on getting a car until December of this year (2018) but I went into the dealership to get an oil change on the Galant and ended up letting them run my credit and was able to get ANY CAR I WANTED WITH NO MONEY DOWN!!! Talk about going in for an oil change, a new battery for 1 of the Galant remotes and an extra key for the Galant to additionally walking out with a 2018 SUV!! I knew the car I wanted that I wanted to have: 1) leather seats 2) heated seats 3) power seats 4) Bluetooth 5) Blind spot monitor 6) Navigation 7) sunroof 8) Sirius XM radio 9) backup camera ...now out of those 9 things I got 8!! What I learned was every model has something the other doesn’t. I’m 37 years old and this is the 1st time I’m actually paying attention of what I want in a car vs. just having a car, funny thing is I was looking for another sedan and didn’t even want an SUV because I thought I’d be spending more money on gas, let alone I said I wasn’t buying another Mitsubishi. Now my Galant has not ever given me any problems but I thought I’d just get a different brand since this would be my 3rd and final car. When I was pregnant with my son I had a 1998 Mazda Protege and that was in November 2001 then I got my Galant in February 2005 and here it is February 2018 and I’m buying another Mitsubishi. I did t want a car note I was originally planning on going to an auction but figured I’d i was going to have a car note to try and have it paid off in 2 years by the time my son graduates from high school. When I looked around I saw the SEL sport model and thought it was cool cuz it had the heated seats and everything that I wanted besides the sun roof it had a moonroof. When she showed me the LE model yes it had the sunroof and multi camera view but it was manual seats and they weren’t heated so that was a no go. Then she showed me the SEL Outlander and had me park it right next to the Sport SEL model and that was it, it was 13 inches longer and had more cargo space which I needed because I shop at Costco. I was looking for a car that was no longer than 191.5 inches because I have a garage and we park both cars behind the other so in order for the garage to close I needed a car that was going to fit length wise. I looked at Honda’s, Toyota’s and Nisssans and I would’ve paid more for the Nissan Rogue with everything I would’ve wanted an additional packages, the Toyota CH-R had manual seats and the Honda HR-V didn’t have the Honda Sense safety features. I didn’t get the S-AWC nor 4WD because I don’t drive in the snow, mud or mountains, I live in Long Beach,Ca and having the V6 engine wasn’t needed for me. It was going to be more on gas and I’m just a regular driver so the 2.4L with CVT was suitable enough for me as I am a sensible driver. Then when it came to my car insurance it was CHEAPER than getting the other 3 brands I looked at and priced certain models so I am very happy with my car. To think I didn’t even have an SUV in mind and I came out with one plus got $2,500 in rebates so to come on here and see actual owner reviews made me happy because the expert revues were poor. This thing doesn’t need a V6 engine, I just put it in sport mode and I get a HUGE KICK in speed whereas the speed in the regular drive mode is good. I have an iPhone so the Apple car play is perfect for me and my son when we are in the car, I was bummed that my particular Mitsubishi dealership didn’t have the SEL model where I could’ve had the Touring package which had the Frontal collision mitigation and lane departure BUT when I was originally making my list I didn’t have those things in there for
 safety so the blind spot monitor with lane change assist and rear cross traffic assist are just fine, I tell you ANYTHING that I would’ve got was gonna be an UPGRADE from that 2004 Galant so I’m happy, I didn’t choose to get a sunroof in my model and I’m ok without that and the navigation really comes from my iPhone connected via USB using the Apple car play so it’s cheaper than the Nissan or Honda models which actually has Navigation in it because I’m using my cell phone so that’s ok to, I still say I have Navigation because of the Siri maps and GPS on my phone. I won’t really be using that 3rd row I just wanted it because other cars with this price range had the normal 2 rows and I know the Rogue has 3 rows but the Outlander has more cargo room overall. Besides it’s just me and my teenage son who now has his own car so now it’s just me and I’m ok with what I have, this car will last me 15 years just like my Galant, if I do get another car after this my son will be buying it for me.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Jason, 09/08/2018,great car for the money,4,"Third row is tight. Only good for small children. Lots of room when third row is down. Car seems well built. Solid chassis, no rattles. quiet cabin. Car may seem dated in design, which isn't a bad thing because it has given Mitsubishi time to fix any issues. Like the fact that the car is fully assembled in Japan and almost all parts are sourced there as well.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Taylor Walton, 06/23/2019,Aside swop collision rolling twice,5,"This car and my guardian angle saved my whole family. I have a family of 6 about to be a family of 7. 2 of my 4 children were in the accident. One was 1 years old in a rear facing car seat behind the driver the other a 5 year old behind the passenger. we hit another car cutting into our lane going around 70 miles per hour throwing our car into the air rolling us twice through an intersection. All the airbags deployed upon impact once we stoped rolling the car landed on its tires we hit in the passenger side leaving the front door unable to open me and my husband crawled out the front driver door quickly running to the back doors to remove our children who were extremely frightened but ALIVE! My 1 year old received bruises on her thighs and head my son cuts to neck and hips seat belt burns he was transferred from our local hospital to children’s hospital in l.a due to leaking fluid which they believe now was some internal bleeding that corrected itself no need for surgery thank god. My husband received a hand sprain and bruising and burns along his forearm and hips. I revived a broken wrist and hand seatbelt burns bruises and cuts. I am also 8 months pregnant the baby was monitored for 24 hours and has shown no signs of distress and no detachment from placenta. We were all wearing our seat belts I believe the combination of seat belts this cars saftey rating and a miracle saved my family’s life the fact that we walked away from this with such minor injuries blows my mind and also the doctors I would 100% recommended this car based on the fact that it saved my family Iv never been more thankful

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,R. Mumford, 01/20/2018,600 miles so far.,4,"LE is higher level of trim with fog lights, moon roof and rear radar. Not the slowest vehicle (2.4L) i have owned but it ok for merging on highways and scooting around. I find it fun to drive and very good on gas. Smart display a good size screen incorporates several options. Us your smart phone (USB or Bluetooth ) and you pretty much have it all!  Lots of room inside and seats for 5 adults & 2kids.  Ride and handling ok , to few miles on odometer to comment. When you take into account the discount the price was a big factor. Mitsubishi has been around a long time , My guess you will be happy with purchase of this Outlander. My friend Bob has the sport model.  Smaller but he's very happy ! July, now have 9k on vehicle. Great SUV. Update ( Jan. 2019)  traded in at one year old with 15,800 miles. No problems with car. Engine noise always caught my attention. The engine gave me no problems I always was noisier then other cars. Seem to be a lighter-weight car. The bad was trade in value was terrible!

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Amy, 04/26/2019,I am in love!,5,"I spend much time researching and test driving many vehicles before I make a purchase.  I do not go for bling or big names, I go for value and reliability.  My brand new off the show room floor Outlander was $7,000 + less then the 4 yr old Acadia, Durango, Explorer and Rendezvous I test drove and yet I liked it the most.  Its not a race car but plenty zippy, great handling and I love that it is true 4X4!!  The warranty from the specific dealer was the best I have ever heard of. Its not hyped up, but when I looked at it, drove it, and saw the price I wondered why everyone is not driving these.  We drove it from MN to FL and was plenty comfortable even for my 6'4""  husband. I love the versatility of the 7 passenger seating when needed, which is tight but great to have in a pinch, and you can configure the seats in many different ways to accommodate different passenger and load variations.   Not only was it great value but it keeps on giving with amazing gas mileage.  The resale value is not great, but I plan on driving it many many years and loving it!!  12,000 miles on it already and loved every one.  I will have to check in once I reach my 100,000 mark :)
4/2020 45,000 miles and still loving this vehicle.  I feel it is so under the radar and deserves so much more acknowledgment from the consumers and industry. It also helps that the dealership I purchased it from is amazing too :)

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,jon, 05/20/2019,Excellent Vehicle - Got a great deal - Get one!,5,"Things you should know:  IIHS Safety Pick with the GT model. Make sure to get the Touring Package when you get the GT model for all the safety features, such as Forward Crash Mitigation, Lane Departure Warning, Cross Traffic Warning, and Adaptive Cruise Control.  The GT comes with AWD/4WD that is adjustable.  Yes, it has settings for Snow and Locking the differentials, but it has an Eco mode. Eco mode decouples the rear, making the drive Front Wheel, to increase fuel economy, while allowing the AWD/4WD to engage when needed.  The GT model (please note: Outlander GT I am discussing is the 7 passenger Outlander, not the sporty little ""Outlander GT."" ) has leather, a 710 watt surround audio system, a 3.0L V6, and a 6 speed transmission.  The last 2 are the biggest difference between the GT and all other models. The CUV (oddly called a crossover, as Mitsubishi designates it as a truck) is well built, easy to drive, surprisingly quick, runs quiet, feels solid, and is fun to drive.  The Things I Wish Were Better:  Bigger fuel tank - range even though I get great gas mileage - is a bit short, Storage Space for the front seats is slim, No light in the Headlamp stem, Windshield Wiper stem is confusing, Side visibility is limited (mitigated by the Blindspot Warning) hard to get into 3rd row seats,  and the Menu and Settings of the tech is a learning curve.   None of these things are big issues.  Things I like: Driving position, ease of controls, comfortable seats (all 3 rows) Heated Seats, easy to drive, the Forward Crash Mitigation is amazing to behold - works faster than you can react, the Adaptive Cruise is exceptional, everything works, and works well.  Buy one if you can find it.  I got mine new (60 miles on it) for $25,900 for a $35k vehicle.  Excellent gas mileage (24 mixed, 32+ hwy.)  Eco mode that actually works, saving fuel.   Differences between the 2019 model and 2018:  Tuned the suspension for better control and ride, A/C Vent for center row seat, Passenger front seat is now Power.  Prices are nearly the same.  I suggest get the Tour Package with the Safety Features.  One drawback is there are fewer Dealerships for Mitsubishi than most major makes, though it seems they are opening more, thus the ""ok"" rating on dealership support.  Go get one, they are excellent and a great value.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,JRM, 10/07/2018,This is our 2nd Outlander,4,"After comparing every crossover & SUV with a 3rd row seat on everything from gas mileage to oil change cost, tire size and replacement cost, included options & more - the Outlander came out ahead.  Our 1st was a 2014 SE with touring package (leather, sunroof & Rockford Fosgate audio).  Drove that vehicle 55k miles in 2 years and only had to the the a/c compressor replaced.  Was relaxed under warranty & was in & out of the dealership service department in a couple hours.   Traded that one in on a 2016 SEL with touring pkg, leather, Rockford Fosgate audio, & appearance package (18” wheels, “ground effects” & LED fog lights).   Also added the roof rack cross rails & tow package (purchase from the dealer).  Have driven this vehicle 45,000 mi since Dec 2016 & not a single issue.  Just replaced the tires & the only maintenance has  been regular oil changes (dealer provides a $39.99 coupon for full synthetic) & air filter changes.  The only 2 complaints I have about this vehicle is 1. No rear climate controls & you need to crank up the climate control fan to get almost anything out.  2.  They appear to have changed something with the seats between the ‘14 & ‘16 model years because the ‘14’s seats were significantly more comfortable.  The cargo space with the 3rd row up is not great, but that is why I added the roof rails & tow package.  If they add rear climate controls or even rear vents & would probably continue to trade up to another Outlander in the future.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,vegascs, 02/23/2019,Best Overall Value For A 3 Row Seating Gas SUV,5,"First off I was looking for a 3 row seating SUV that was fuel efficient and wasn't too big and didn't cost too much. Went to several dealerships of different makes and compared all the 3 row seating SUV's I could find. I already knew about the Mitsubishi brand and that they do make durable and reliable cars back in the Philippines. When I test drove this, I was impressed at how awesome the interior was and it was all standard including the fog lights and sunroof of my 2018 Outlander SE. It shifted gears smoothly and ride was comfortable with a roomy interior. After buying it and having it now for the 3rd week, I am amazed at the the fuel efficiency for a 3 row seating gas SUV, I am getting about 25-30city and 40-45hwy depending on how I drive. Just like in any vehicle, turn off eco mode to get more power but you use up more gas. It also has a spare tire underneath so to get this fuel efficiency is awesome! Don't believe in the so called expert reviews, read reviews from consumers and test drive it for yourself to see what a great value these vehicles are. The seats are not as of heavy, but they are sturdy as long as its used properly and contributes to the weight of the vehicle which helps with the fuel efficiency. Its an awesome vehicle try it for yourself. After 20000 still lovin it, only regular oil changes needed and still runs great! If you need more power just turn off eco mode and you will feel the difference.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Sal, 10/23/2018,Mitsubishi Outlander GT,2,"I have had this SUV for about 6 months. It is a good performance vehicle, however one thing really bad is its gas range. On regular street driving conditions you get 220 miles per tank, which means you are looking for your next gas station just after about 100 miles of filling up. On long drives it gives little better but no where close to other SUVs in this class. If you plan to drive a lot or would like to take long trips THIS IS NOT YOUR SUV. Also the workmanship and interior design was done by someone who will never drive this car. Extremely limited storage space and badly designed space utilization. Mitsubishi missed the mark on this one.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,JLit, 06/12/2018,Best Decision,5,"Update: 7 months and 6,800 miles later - everything I wrote down below is still true. Drove it in snow here in Chicago a couple weeks and it performed very well. Best bang for your buck. Money was not an issue for our decision with this truck (considering we just bought a new home after buying this truck). We honestly shopped around for months and tested many small SUVs. This truck was not even in our top 3 cars originally considered. 
Original Review: Previously owned 2003 CRV for 8 yrs. Also owned 2007 Pilot which I used to trade in for this Outlander. Don't believe the so called experts.  Drive it for yourself.  Easily drives better than my old CRV when it was new.  The best part is owning a real 4WD for literally under $22k. Tax and interest included.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Former Mitsubishi skeptic , 01/16/2020,Love it - 2018 Outlander SEL S-AWD,5,"Researched throughly and test drove Crv, traverse, nearly bot a Buick Enclave, Highlander.  Bought a Outlander SEL S-AWC.  Find it to be well done.  As others noted...the “expert” reviews and rankings are wrong.  They compare 0-60 times and some random specs to $50k SUVs and say it’s no good.  There is plenty of plastic in even luxury SUVs, I have seen it and touched it.
I was More influenced by the owner reviews because people that have them love them.  I went to drive one and really did not want to like it, but I did.  The pricing for new or used is friendly, great warranty, good performance.  I have owned many GMC, Ford, Honda’s and Toyota’s over time and I find the Mitsubishi quality as good as anyone’s.
Cars have become an “appliance” for me, but I remain a sucker for the features of the Luxury and status brands.  I recommend you check out Mitsubishi.
Update 6 months later:  Even better than expected...not one issue. 30mpg in town with the ac on. Once you get used the CVT transmission you can get all the performance you want.  Small details demonstrate to me it is well engineered and true Japanese quality.  Check it out for yourself then look at the price.   
Still don't recall ever seeing a positive 'professional' review.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Wally, 12/19/2017,Underpowered,4,"Outlander is a nice vehicle but is sluggish to drive. To upgrade to a 6 cylinder brings the price up too high.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,badgirlruby, 10/29/2019,it’s true...this car is GREAT,5,"Someone said the Outlander is better than the Cadillac. I personally think this is somewhat of a stretch but I can see how it comes in comparison. This car is amazing! I love every feature about it. I have a 2018 Limited Edition and am in love it. I do not get tired of my car, everything I see it i’m like...damn, I love my car! It can pick up speed, but gradually. You just have to learn to maneuver it, it’s got its tricks. For a standard radio system, it’s got a darn good bass and audio projection. I love that my car brings an all black paint along with the interior and the rims included. Feels luxurious as can be. I love the fact that it lets me know whenever my maintenance is due, or whenever my wheels are running low. It’s a hell of a car, I don’t know why car experts claim it to be junk. I feel as if I made the right decision when I purchased the car and for the price, it’s an awesome vehicle and I believe it can hold up to its competitors. My car is sexy, and for the 7 year warranty, who wouldn’t consider that??

Runs great, plenty of pep for us but we know it's not a sports car. Gets great gas mileage, with 5 people, luggage, A/C on and cruise set at 81mph it gets 29+mpg. Even around town it averages 27mpg. After 9 months of loving this car, I bought myself one. Very impressed with the Japanese build quality and the value for the money. Only complaint is the A/C seems pretty weak but it works ok. Also, if you are over 6 feet tall, the driver's seat probably won't slide back far enough for you. I'm 5'9"" and drive with the seat all the way back. Got myself the SEL with leather and the big stereo, it's fantastic. Just hoping Mitsubishi motors doesn't leave America anytime soon. Don't know why the ""experts"" are so down on these cars.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,dennis in vero, 04/25/2019,best kept secret on the suv market awesome mpg,4,"My 2018 Outlander is awesome.. the only drawbacks is the a/c cycles on and off every 5-seconds on and then 8 seconds off resulting in a temp difference of 8-10 degrees I have had it to the dealership 3x for this concern and I was advised that's what  they do. It causes me to run the a/c on the highest fan setting to keep back seat passengers comfortable. the fan is on high so its noisy. My 2016 outlander did not do this and would freeze you out. The 2018 has the new 1234a Freon. I work in the auto industry and I feel the evaporator temp sensor is over sensitive im gonna give my dealership another chance if they cannot fix the issue I will enact lemon law procedures and offer a final repair attempt.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Neil Werner, 07/07/2019,Disappointed,2,"Bought this 2018 Outlander with no money out of pocket - zero down, 1% financing...a reminder of the fact that you get what you pay for.  This 4 cylinder, CVT is terribly under powered. Add 6 passengers and you wish the floor opened like the Flintstone mobile for help moving.  The CVT transmission is awful although I may simply not be used to the way it shifts...or doesn't.  The steering is terrible - Had the dealer check it and they told me it was normal for electric steering. You need to constantly correct your direction as if the steering box is over tightened even though it has rack and pinion steering. The steering was like this from day 1 and is very unrelaxing to drive on the highway. Just took the car on a long summer trip and the air conditioning cycles warm air intermittently as if the condenser fan or compressor cycles too often. Only 8,000 miles and less than a year old. To summarize, a poor choice of vehicles. On the plus side, my wife likes it and it has 4wd, although the switch is a button on the console and it easily changes modes if you rest something on the center console.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Evan, 08/24/2019,Love the versatility,5,"Bought base model 2wd with 3mi, and it’s surpassed all my expectations in 1 year and 15k miles. Handles, accelerates and brakes well, CVT “shifts” smooth as possible, 27 mpg, and the interior is pretty quiet at speed. With the seats down, I’ve had it completely packed to the roof with furniture, boxes and I’m quite surprised at how well it fit while still offering left over space. Seats are comfortable and easy to fold flat. Has everything I want and nothing I don’t need - great features even in base trim. I don’t love all the blank button spaces, the sun visors don’t slide out, and the cup holders are a little awkwardly placed, but all storage areas are large and extremely usable. I don’t know why the professional reviewers seem to hate this car so much: The rav4 engine sounds like a box of rocks, the CRV has an intrusive auto start/stop w/ turbo lag, and the Forester is more expensive for less a lot less options (4 speakers, ugly steel wheels in 2018-19?) The outlander misses all those flaws and is an extremely capable daily driver.

mitsubishi,outlander,2018,Daniel Gonzalez, 03/08/2019,Avoid buying a Mitsubishi,1,"A known issue that I had no idea about before purchasing a new Mitsubishi Outlander is the rocking driver side seat found in the powered versions (SEL trims).  At just 1900 miles, I noticed the movement. After several repair attempts, the seat is still rocking. There is over an inch of movement at this time. I'm now at 17,400 miles, and I'm driving this newly purchased vehicle that is defective. There is no sense of security while driving this suv as the seat rocks back and fourth over an inch. This seems dangerous, and I would recommend that anyone who may be interested in Mitsubishi vehicles to consider another manufacturer that will stand by their product with honesty and integrity.

Mitsubishi says thats how it's supposed to be because all the other new ones are the same.  To me that means they are all broken.

I came from a Ford escape titanium with 2.0 eco boost. This thing is very under powered for a V6. Very little horsepower and very low torque. Transmission jumps down 3 gears when hitting hills then keeps up shifting and downshifting all the way up the hill. Desperately needs more power and torque.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,TomW, 11/24/2018,Our third Outlander,5,"As the title says the new 2019 GT we have is our 3rd Outlander.  We can not see paying any more for one of the names that are ranked higher in the polls.  I have owned Porsches and other high end cars in my life but feel the Outlander is as well put together as any car that I have owned.  The warranty is the best in the industry and I have only had 4 recalls for all four cars for minor issues.  Never for anything like brakes or transmissions or motor issues.  At 6'3"" and 250 I need a car that is comfortable and the Outlander offers the adjustments to allow me to do so.  The leather heated seats on the GT are very comfortable.  My wife and I take a twice a year trip from NC to IA and back, 1700 miles roundtrip each time.  Very much like the fuel economy, right now after less than a 1000 miles are seeing 25-26 mpg on short trips, combination of country road and highway.  Can't wait for some long runs on a highway.  This is much better than our 2009 which we still have and is still going strong after 190,000 miles.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,John, 11/19/2018,The Best Cheap Mid-Size SUV,5,"I drove an Outlander in Africa through thick mud, deep sand, giant potholes, rocky roads and never got stuck. I travelled long distances through desolate areas and never broke down. Those experiences proved to me that this is a true off roader. I bought the newest model and its been improved even more. My GT is top of the line with all the high-end luxury options, but the price is half that of any of the competition. There is no hype surrounding the Outlander, so it's ignored by most people. Mitsubishi doesn't sell the elite Montero or Montero Sport in the US, so this is the closest substitute. I appreciate this SUV because it gets me home through even the worst road conditions.
"
mitsubishi,outlander,2019,DavidM, 07/28/2019,1K Rental - Part 1,4,"Part One
First of all, I rented this for a Midwest swing of 5 states and I put just a bit under 1,000 miles on it.   So while I'm not a long-term owner, I did put about 200 miles a day on this SUV and I think that I have a few things worth sharing on that basis.

For my little family of three, this smaller SUV (specifically, it was the Mitsubishi Outlander SEL w/AWD) worked out great for what we wanted it to do!  The back seat was roomy enough that my six year old wasn’t constantly kicking the front passenger seat all of the time.  Right away, this is a crowd pleaser.  The SEL trim is covered in leather which I think is always a bonus when little kids could be spilling stuff in the back seat.  We didn’t find this SUV to be particularly comfortable or unconformable – however my wife was pretty quiet about the whole 1,000 miles, so it couldn’t have been really terrible, either.  

The car did occasionally drone on freeway though, and we didn’t really care for that.  However, when it did, we were going pretty fast; I had the cruise set at 85mph through large portions of South Dakota where the limit on I-29 is 80mph.  The SUV really had no trouble at all maintaining speed once you got there, but as others have said, it’s not sports-car performance in any way.  I had never driven a CVT-equipped vehicle this far, ever.  Mixed emotions for me – the RPM’s would get right up there and the thing would start to pull itself up to speed.  I never felt like it was unsafe, at all, it just required a fairly heavy right foot, which I was more than willing to provide.  I wasn’t expecting a lot of speed out of the 2.4 inline four, and really at the end of the day, it was plenty for what I needed it to do.   If you are used to something a whole lot faster, then this would get to be frustrating pretty quickly IMHO.   The range on this SUV, at least on my road-trip was about 400 miles, probably a little more.  I never got much below a quarter of a tank before I filled it up.  MPG was about 27 for the entire trip.  

The automatic climate control in the car is worth mentioning.  It worked very well, including the vents in the back seat for my daughter.  My only gripe is that the vents cannot be turned on or off up-front using knobs or sliders.  We didn’t like that.  The ability to change their direction seemed to be limited as well.  Minor issues, but things that we noticed.  The SUV has heated seats, which we did not use as it was hot most of the time.  This car did not have a sunroof, so I have nothing to say about that.  

Overall, on the road, the Mitsubishi was competent on the road and comfortable.  I’d drive one of these again for 1,000 miles if I had to without (too) many complaints.   "
mitsubishi,outlander,2019,Debbie, 06/23/2019,My daughter is still alive and ok,4,"My daughter bought an Outlander Sport in Oct of 19. She hasn’t had it very long. She and a co-worker were leaving work a week ago, and she got hit from behind. Luckily they walked away with being banged up and bruises. The lady hit them coming off the freeway at a high rate of speed. It totaled the car but they are ok. The only complaint I have is when Finacing the vehicle is we wanted GAP protection and the finance guy wouldn’t give it to us, saying the car is worth more then owed on it. Not true! So now she will be without a car till then. I just wanted to let you guys know that your vehicle did what it was suppose to do in the situation she was in.

Test it for yourself and see what actual owners have to say.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,Robert, 02/13/2019,Spirit of the Montero,5,"As a former Montero driver, I wanted a new one, but they aren't sold here. I looked at many suvs until I found a unique Outlander made in Kamo, Japan at Pajero Manufacturing, where the Montero is built.  The Montero is a legendary 4x4 that can be found in the harshest places around the world and ranks as one of the best vehicles ever built. My Outlander is a close substitute and retains the overall feel of a Montero, but on a smaller, lighter scale. I will buy separate sets of snow and mud tires to enhance the winter/off road capabilities. I bought this because much of my daily driving is on dirt roads and I need a capable AWD with cargo capacity. If the Montero becomes available again I will upgrade to that.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,michael williams, 11/12/2019,Love our Outlander SEL,5,"Don't listen to [non-permissible content removed] writing the reviews. Just ask a owner like me. Ive owned many SUV and the Outlander drives better, handles better, awesome gas mileage, visibility is better, and price is better!. My last SUV was a Lexus before my wife talked me into the Outlander. It has all the gadgets that the Lexus had. Insurance is cheaper and the warranty rocks. The LED lights and fog lights really is impressive. The engine power isn't that bad. If you learn to drive a CVT you can really get the Outlander moving. Everybody knows you just don't floor a CVT you get a feel for a power band with foot throttle modulation. The big draw is that it is 98% made in Japan with high quality in compliance assembly. The huge touchscreen and Rockford Fosgate stereo blasts when you want and sounds great when you want easy listening. We bought the Outlander fully loaded at 30K while the competition for the same package was 40K.. The 10 year 100K mile warranty with Vip package and you don't have to pay for maintenance, tires, and oil changes!! Thank you Mitsubishi and so long to all the rest.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,LRod, 09/26/2019,My Second Outlander!,5,"I just bought a new 2019 SEL which was a replacement for a 2017 SE. We wanted the leather, sunroof, upgraded stereo, rear A/C vents and the safety systems included in the 2019 model. Like many others have stated, the Outlander is the best priced mid size 7 passenger SUV. We put 50,000 trouble free miles in a 3 year period on the 2017 and don't regret buying Mitsubishi at all. Best warranty, built in Japan and at a lower price than anything comparable. About the resale value: They lose the most value on year #1, after that they maintain the value like any other comparable vehicle (I've done the research!). Just keep it for at least 3 years! These things are built like tanks and don't break! Don't get influenced by non owner reviews. I'm convinced that those people simply promote other mainstream brands while being totally biased against Mitsubishi. When we bought the 2017, we test drove Toyota, Nissan & Honda and the Mitsubishi out shined them all when you see what you get for the price. Bottom line: If you want a fully loaded 7 passenger, Japanese built SUV with a super warranty, buy the Outlander. My second Mitsubishi won't be my last!

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,OutlanderDriver, 08/29/2019,Much better than what reviews say,5,"After reading all the ""expert"" reviews about the Outlander, an SUV shopper would pretty much be discouraged to buy one and look somewhere else. Anyway, I test drove a Subaru Forester, Honda CRV, Nissan Rogue, and the Outlander.  I ended up choosing the 2019 Outlander SEL over the other SUVs I test drove. The Outlander was the quietest and most comfortable one to drive.  It has the most features that come standard with the SEL. The second row reclines and can be moved forward and back and it has a third row that can come in handy. The Outlander also had the best price and warranty and even offers road side assistance.  The Rockford Fosgate sound system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto connectivity sounded much better than the sound sytems of the other SUVs I test drove.  It has almost been 3 months since I purchased the Outlander and have no regrets.  I love driving it and enjoy listening to the awesome stereo.  Although the 4 cylinder won't blast you to 60 mph in a few seconds, it is quite adequate and delivers better than expected gas mileage.  It rides smooth and is very quiet contrary to what I what car magazines experts have said.  Any complaints? Maybe one which is the deletion of the spare tire and putting a tire repair kit instead.  But other than that, I find it hard to agree with what car expert reviewers say about the Mitsubishi Outlander.  I'm happy I chose the 2019 Outlander and continue to feel the same way as time goes on owning and driving the Outlander.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,Bob W, 12/22/2019,2019 Outlander 2.4 SEL,4,"This is my second Mitsubishi SUV and to-date I have had very positive experiences with both vehicles.  My wife and I purchased the 2019 Outlander SEL with a 2.4 engine and we have had no regrets with our choice.  Gas mileage is good and although I really do need to be a little more scientific, the 2.4 in the Outlander appears to be delivering comparable if not better mileage than our previous RVR with the 2.0.

Acceleration on major highways is very good and cruising at 70 -75 mph is effortless. Going up steep hills at posted or above speeds on both streets and highways around Vancouver BC is easily accomplished.   The vehicle interior and exterior are attractive, functional and effective. The model we purchased came with all of the features that most drivers would demand and many that are nice to have but not heavily used.
We did not purchase the vehicle for its 7 seat capacity and the 3rd row seating looks pretty minimal and peerhaps best used in a pinch or for small children. We simply enjoy and utilize the cargo space behind the second row seating.   
Given our experience with Mitsubishi, our satisfaction with the Outlander and its ability to meet our needs in our driving environment, we would give the Outlander a solid 4.5 out of 5.  Our ownership experience has included some of the top names in domestic and imported vehicles and we have found that satisfaction should reflect what the vehicle was purchased to do, the value provided by the vehicle and its performance in meeting these fair expectations.  We have no hesitation in giving the Outlander the 4.5 it deserves.  As of the end of June 2020, my initial review remains accurate.  No issues, post-breakin, fuel consumption is now very good and performance has been excellent.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,G boyd, 01/28/2019,Nicely upgraded,5,"Despite the Edmunds review, the 2019 Outlander accelerates and shifts very quickly; much improved 8-speed CVT.

More affordable than ever with the best warranty in the business.  The shame is that there are not more dealers nationally, but well worth finding one.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,tfinvold, 11/12/2019,Great Little All Wheel Drive Crossover SUV,5,"I bought this vehicle for the highly rated safety on IIHS and after owning the 2016 4 cyl version I decided to test drive the 6 cyl and ended up trading it in for a 2019 because yes the V6 GT has a lot more power and doesn't have that annoyingly loud engine noise in the cabin that the 4 cyl does. The 4 cyl version of this car is mated to a CVT and seems to be about as weak as a lawn mower but in terms of performance the V6 will over take anything while merging on the highway. There is a huge difference with these engine configurations and it seems mitsubishi tends to focus on 4 cyl in the trim line up as you can only get a V6 in the GT trim. I did note that the fuel economy on the window sticker is a lie (as with most new vehicles) I only get about 16-22mpg in this car. The car has an excellent all wheel drive system that has never left me stuck despite off roading. The stock tires are junk and never cared for Toyo A24's that came with the vehicle. I recommend some off road tires if you do any excursions to the wilderness to really take advantage of the high quality all wheel drive system but because of the ridiculously large stock rims its difficult to find off road tires. I recommend going with smaller rims to give you better choices for off road tires. This vehicle reminds me a bit of my 97 Montero in terms of off road ability. The third row seat is really only for small children or very tiny short people less than 5'4"" The towing is pretty good with the V6 I pull my 3000lb camper without too much struggle and certainly no problems with over heating even during a hot uphill desert run in the summer. The towing on the 4 cyl is pretty useless at about 1500lbs so its not really more helpful than a compact car if you get the 4 cyl. I would recommend the V6 GT because of all the cool and neat features that the GT top of the line trim offers as its about the price point of a base model Honda Pilot, mind you that base model Honda Pilot wont have 4wd either. The fuel economy isn't stellar on either the 4 cyl or V6. Overall its a great car but you'll have to overlook its small short comings but for the price you can't beat it.

I went skiing on trip, parked over huge pile of snow, used 4x4 lock awd mode and got out easy as breeze. Yes it is cheap car but it’s overall been great car. I had 2016 Acura MDX so i know this car comes close to it. Average mpg is 24. Only downsize is there no spare tire smh. Best mpg on highway can reach 38 mpg. 2nd row seat can be tilted back for more comfort. Still has better warranty than all 3rd row suv.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,JimFromMaine, 10/12/2019,"Versatile, great for families, a great bargain",5,"I tested twenty SUVs (midsize and larger).  I am tall (6'3""), and wanted something comfortable to sit in.  VERY few midsize SUVs fit me at all (any with sunroofs were out of the question).  Even half of the larger SUVs, such as Flex and Tahoe, did not fit me well.  Forester was the best for midsize, but the Outlander is almost as good.  I must correct the notion that this car has no power or lags.  BECAUSE the Outlander is not huge, the 2.4 liter does pretty well with acceleration and overall power.  What really sold it to us (other than fitting my size), is how very versatile it is. The Outlander is a bit narrowr and a bit longer than the Murano that it is replacing. We can put all three kids in the second row if we ever need to pack a ton of stuff. It is cramped for the kids that way, but it will do in a pnch.  Carrying 7 passengers can also be done in a pinch.  We usually just have two kids in the second row, and one in the third.  This gives them more separation and space than if we only had two rows.  All of us are comfortable (partially because the second row seats slide forward and back to meet out needs).  Getting into and out of the third row is pretty easy for the kids (even I could do it if I had to).  The car is quiet, and all the controls are laid out well. (We got the SE version).   Material and workmanship seem good (better than many other cars that I tested).  Visibility all around is excellent. Handling is also very good (I have tested it under some unusual conditions).  The backup camera works well.  I also appreciate that it doesn't overdo the ""safe driving"" technology (where the computer tries to take over and drive the car).....we did not want that. And it doesn't have the silly ""auto shut off/turn on"" feature that kicks in at stoplights. We paid almost $10,000 less than if we had gone with most other midsize 3-row SUVs.  That's a lot of money, and if this car works well for us for 7 or 8 years, then I feel we will have gotten a steal.  Mitsubishi is clearly doing something right, as their sales numbers continue to grow.   I'll report back after driving it in snow, but I expect the Super AWC to work great. The icing on the cake is that the 2019 Outlander looks fantastic (we got the cherry red exterior).  Our local Mitsu dealer has been around a long time and has a great reputation for service, so we have zero concerns about after-purchase.  I did not originally even consider this car, but after driving it, I was so surprised by it that we ended up buying it.  I urge you to give it a chance.
**** TWO MONTH REPORT:  Did 50-55 mph yesterday on snowy roads, with SUMMER tires!  Amazingly good AWD. Getting 26 mpg (average).  I am 6’3” and rode in the third row for a couple hours.  Acceleration and power is very good.   I can’t think of a single thing we do not like about this car.  Amazing value.....costs at least $4k more to get the same quality and features elsewhere..

And I’m not sure if it’s final repair. The case manager from the Mitsubishi headquarters seems did not care that we are having such issues with the new car.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,D. Richardson, 09/23/2020,30.1 mpg on first 700 mile trip. Model is SEL V-6,5,"Bought a used 2019 V-6 SEL. Had 28k and no issues when I test drove it. This is definitely the best deal $ wise I found. I retired after 37 years in auto sales, and even surprised myself at the features this vehicle has. I’ve been getting 30+mpg on highway trips at 70-80 mph, and 25-26mpg around town. That was an unexpected plus. My only negative was it came without a spare tire, only a pump and fixaflat, but I got the dealer to throw in a spare, and I’ll buy the mounts to put it underneath where there is a place for it. I presume it originally had runflats, and when they were replaced they installed regular radials.
As someone that has sold almost every Make of vehicles over the years, I am extremely happy with the Outlander. I didn’t really need 7 passenger seating, so I leave the rear seats folded down and have ample storage space. Blind spot warning system, automatic wipers, hands free stereo and cell phone links make for the best safety features, IMO. Bought it with 28,000 miles, but Full warranty till 60k, and over 3 more years(5 from in service date). Never been happier with a personal vehicle, and I’ve driven hundreds of different ones in the past(demos), as I worked in sales management most of my life.

Compare the lower cost to other similar SUVs and this is the best vehilce for less. The highway gas mileage is much better than advertised.The comfort and smooth transmision is impressive. We are glad we did not spend $10K to $20K more. The brakes had safely helped us out several times to avoid the deer(s) or other guy(s).  We plan to look at Mits again first on our next purchase.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,Jeff, 04/01/2020,Happy Owner,5,"I’ve had many vehicles over the years, American made trucks, Subaru Outback’s, and I was an armour reconnaissance soldier driving off-road for over ten years as well. This vehicle, for the price point is great. It’s great off-road and handles everything our Canadian winters can throw at it. I have the GT trim and it hauls very nicely. Never had any issues with pick, speed, or handling. I think this is a great little SUV. We are a family of four with two dogs, and we all fit for day trips no problem. Only thing they could’ve done better is storage in front and rear. I got a roof carrier and it’s all good now.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,Harry, 04/17/2019,Terrible Resale Value,2,"if you are going to buy a Mitsubishi you better be ready to keep it for four or five years because if you trade that car in 3 months after you buy it you will lose your tail your shirt and your shoes. Horrible car to drive down the highway experiencing a crosswind.

mitsubishi,outlander,2019,Sea Captain, 09/29/2019,Performance is anemic,2,"As I write this I have a rented 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. It’s acceleration (4cylinder) is so anemic it borders on dangerous while accelerating while merging into traffic.  It’s reminiscent of the 1970 VW Westfalia Camper I had in college in 1971. You pray for downhill on-ramps and tailwinds. Other than that everything is acceptable. I will never again rent one.  PS, it’s gas mileage is less than my Mercedes SL class.

This car disappointed this Outback owner at every turn.  Lousy acceleration, sloppy, fishtail handling, mediocre mileage, a noisy engine, and downright dangerous in turns - didn't these have a rollover problem back in the '90s? - all make it a distant competitor to Subarus.  Then  there are the unnecessary gadgets that get in the way of each other and conspire to thwart the driver from having a decent driving experience.  I would never buy this car and recommend others not to do so.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Chris, 11/26/2018,"Comfortable, capable, affordable, electric SUV!",5,"We’ve had our Outlander PHEV for a month now and here’s my first impressions.  There really isn’t anything else like it available in the United States... I guess it has been sold in Europe for several years (top selling SUV in the UK, Netherlands and Norway) but they sent them to Europe as fast as they could build them (and sold them for more $) so we just had to wait.  There are several outstanding features to consider now that it is here:

1)  Price:  The well-equipped 2018 SEL model can be found in the US for $30K (perhaps less as the end of the year gets closer).   With a $5,836 federal tax credit, I’ll end up paying ~$24K after tax returns are filed.  Anything else on the market that can give you similar dedicated electric range, 4x4, and towing capability cost over twice as much.

2)  Range:  I’m seeing close to 30 miles of dedicated electric range, plus another 270 miles on unleaded.  I’ve taken it on two long trips now where the battery is mostly depleted and it’s using the gasoline engine to keep a basic charge level on the battery and move us down the highway.  I live in Utah, where there are long stretches of 80 MPH speed limit freeway.  Driving from Salt Lake to St. George (~300 miles) with the cruise control set at 85 for the majority of the trip, we averaged 24.7 MPG.  Granted, the 11 gallon fuel tank is on the small side for long trips like this, but that’s not really the car’s strong point (although 25 MPG is almost 10 MPG better than my last SUV).

The dedicated electric option on shorter trips is where this thing shines though.  My daily commute is 28 miles round trip, so I’m usually able to do it all on electric.  (Your electric range does drop a bit if you run the heater.)  I recharge it each night at home, so my first tank of gas lasted a little over 800 miles.  It has become our go-to vehicle for the quick trips around town.  We pay .11 a Kw and the on-board recharge cost calculator tells me it’s taking a about 80 cents each night to charge up.

3)  4x4:  All wheel drive for winter driving, with a 4x4 lock button if you need to break snow drifts.  I’ve only had it out in one storm so far this year, and just running errands around town, but it seemed sure footed.  I’ll update this as we get further into the winter months.

4) Passenger/Cargo Capacity:  Seats 5 comfortably, with plenty of cargo space left in the back.  The standard Outlander has two small folding seats in the rear for a 7 passenger capacity, but they are omitted in the PHEV.  This leaves you with lots of cargo space in the back, but it would be nice if they could find a way to put back in even one of those small rear jump seats.  The seats you do have are comfortable enough.  Front seats are both heated and fully adjustable via electric switches... these seats are standard even on the lower level SE model (which we own) and leather is standard as well.  Fold down the rear seats and you have a little over six feet of flat floor cargo space back there.  Automatic tailgate is also standard on the base SE model. 

5)  Towing Capability:  The Outlander PHEV is rated to tow 1500 lbs in the US, but 3300 lbs in Europe.  Same vehicle is sold on both continents, so I suspect the lower US rating has more to do with the number of lawyers here, rather than any actual engineering issue.  I had the factory Class 3 receiver hitch added to our SE.  That costs about $700, but well worth it to me to have the towing option.  We have towed with it and found it stable and capable for the short, 20 mile trip we made with it.

6) Warranty:  Mitsubishi backs up the drive train and battery with a 10 year, 100,000 mile warranty.    Mercedes GLC 350e gives you 4 years/50K miles on the drive train, 6 years, 62K on the battery.  Volvo XC90 4 yr/50K miles on both.  Tesla Model X has 4 yr/50K basic, 8 year/unlimited mile powertrain.  All considerably more expensive
 vehicles, each with their own range limitations.

The exterior of the Outlander may be a little dated, but considering how most manufactures over-design the body on electric vehicles (looking at you Nissan) I don’t mind the unassuming nature of Mitsubishi’s offering... just another Outlander from the outside.  From an engineering standpoint however, Mitsubishi has produced a unique vehicle here and perhaps it’s understated looks are part of the reason it has received so little attention here in the USA.  It may also be that Mitsubishi isn’t a big brand here, being one of the smaller manufactures by sales in the US.

I don’t work for Mitsubishi (or any other automotive company).  

I’m just a happy owner, who lives in an area that often has dirty air, and wish more folks new about this machine.

One year later we are still very happy with it.  No issues to report.  Highly recommend the car.  

Update: Sold after three years to upgrade to a Toyota Rav4 Prime... same concept, more battery/capability.  Never had an issue with the Outlander and still highly recommend it, just needed to tow more.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Nate the great, 01/13/2018,Great Test drives,5,"Figured something is better than nothing... so I'll post the first review in case some of you have no nearby dealer.  Test drove a silver GT and red SEL.  Impressions: 1) Gorgeous exterior, nothing not to like.  Nice to have 8.5 inch ground clearance, beats most other CUV's, except the CX9.  Stock rims look great.  2) Interior is also nice.  Seats very comfortable, good thigh support for a 5'11 guy... for what that is worth.  Both driver and passenger seats are 8 way power adjustable, which is very rare for this class.  Not having a third row is probably the deal breaker for my wife.  Between the black and brown leather, I liked black with silver stitching, my wife liked brown with red stitching.  3)  Performance.  Good not great.  Thought acceleration was a bit slow in the 30 to 60 range, although it was plenty zippy off the line.  Really loved the paddle shifters, adjusting the engine resistance when foot was taken off gas (for accelerated charging). B5 for tight city driving or hills made one foot driving possible.  B2 or 1 for highway driving.  Love the amount of control you have over the electric, or combustion.  I would recommend going combustion on the highway and electric in the city.  A guy who bought one at the dealer was in to get a tow hitch installed and told me he was getting 125mpg so far using that technique.   As far as sspension and braking, it was phenomenal.  Ive never experienced regen brakes that tight and smooth... did not feel like hybrid brakes.  Suspension was perfect.... firm but not crazy tight.  Definitely minimized body roll, but could be considered a bit rough for those used to a boat like cadillac experience.  Tech: I'm not a big fan of my car braking for me, so I could care less about that, but for SA, the GT trim has all this crazy safety, tech features plus the moonroof and Rockford sound system.  Android auto, Apple car play standard both trims.  Misc:  Surprised about the 11.5 gallon gas tank... deal breaker for me.  Unless you do all short trips, this is not the right car.  300ish mile range is no bueno if you have to do a cross country haul on occasion.  Worse range than almost any hybrid vehicle.  Still a five star vehicle... but I'd be traveling with a 5 gallon gas can in the rear. Overall great day driving Mitsubishi, and with a 2500 dollar rebate and fed tax refund this is a great deal.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,cvs, 01/12/2018,Superb Mileage and Performance for Daily Commute.,5,"I went to dealer on 30 december and trade in my Prius immediately. I was totally happy with the purchase and it has 5 braking modes which can stop the car by itself. It has three driving mode and if you are confused then dont select anything and the computer will do its job way better. The instant pickup is great (not like sports car). The mileage is good and it has better isulation and you dont see any road noise inside the cabin.  I handles better in the corner and i am driving daily i am liking more and more.  Keep in mind it is regular SUV and for daily commute. I go 20 miles one way daily.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Skylar Bulosan, 02/16/2018,Not your average hybrid!,5,"They gave me an amazing deal on a 2018 Outlander PHEV. This vehicle is a life-saver! I have had it for almost 2 months and still not needed to refill the gas. With my driving I am able to drive solely off the battery and that has been saving me a lot of money! We all know traffic is bad and with my HOV sticker, my commutes to work are cut in half. I don't spend hours in traffic on the 91 and when I go out somewhere that uses toll roads, I sure as hell take advantage of those toll discounts.
"
mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Mike S, 04/30/2018,Great machine!,5,"Overall, we are very happy with this vehicle. It's a great value, particularly when you add up all the federal, state, and local rebates that go with it. Compared to other crossover SUVs with hybrid or electric technology, this was priced very well. Corners that were cut to lower the cost seem minor to us (ie quality of some of the interior elements) but I do wish the front seats were more comfortable for longer drives. Lower back can get a little sore after a couple hours - we plan to use a lumbar support pillow for our next road trip. Battery range for EV only driving is good at ~20 miles - while part of me wishes that was a bit longer, that would mean more battery which means less cargo room and a heavier vehicle, so it seems like a good balance. Cargo space is very good. Safety features on SEL model are appreciated. Vehicle accelerates smoothly and switches between EV and gas mode smoothly and quietly. Car looks good too (though I would lose the huge PHEV stickers on the sides).  I'm surprised it took so long to get to the US after excellent reviews and sales in Europe, but I'm glad it's here now!"
mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Jonathan Paul Quick, 09/22/2018,Outlander Replaces Highlander,5,"UPDATE:

We installed an L2 home charger for the Outlander at a cost of around $700.   Home recharge times are now typically in the 2 - 3 hour range after a full day of driving.   On my 64 mile round trip work commute, I am averaging 51 MPG.   This vehicle is posting phenomenal MPG results far above the EPA average.   Fuel efficiency is truly astonishing given the fact that the Outlander is a mid-size 4WD SUV with 63 cubic feet of space in the trunk.  

We love this vehicle platform so much that I decided to trade-in a late model Hybrid sedan for a 2nd Mitsubishi Outlander SEL PHEV this weekend.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I've spent about a month driving the 2018 Outlander PHEV around 3000 miles around town and short road trips.    This vehicle was purchased as a replacement for a 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid Limited.   Fuel efficiency has been well above the EPA combined rating.   Our worst trip mpg to date was in the mid-thirties.  Recharge times with the included 110v wall charger are usually around 5 hours.   CHADEMO charging is available in < 20 minutes, but high local rates at area charging stations make this implausible as part of a daily commute.  As a daily driver, the vehicle offers all of the creature comforts available from pricier rivals coupled with rock solid build quality.   Front and rear passengers are coddled in the quiet cabin, which is free from squeaks, rattles, and jostling over rough roads.   Vehicle infotainment controls are logical and easy to operate while driving.  The audio system with integrated subwoofer and HDRadio support should satisfy most audiophiles.  Modern safety features such as blindside monitoring and collision avoidance perform flawlessly.   Outward visibility is excellent and the rear backup camera makes parking a breeze. The powertrain provides adequate acceleration with only a muted groan on heavy acceleration.   4WD is available if needed.  Braking distance is at par for the class.  Handling feels more truck-like than most crossovers.  The climate control system outperforms pricier rivals.   Cargo capacity and passenger space easily outclasses comparably price rival SUVs.  Although many vehicles are now sold with embedded modems that enable remote features, the Outlander is limited to WiFi connectivity with cellphones.   Many features such as remote start/stop, lock / unlock, and climate controls are controllable via cellphone, but inaccessible unless owners are with 10 - 20 feet of the vehicle.  At roughly $26k after the federal tax credit, the Outlander offers a tremendous value for the price when compared with rivals from Toyota, Honda, and domestic manufacturers.   I would strongly recommend that prospective SUV buyers take a test drive to see why the Outlander PHEV has been the #1 PHEV SUV in Europe for the last 5 years.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,PHEV_Mark, 03/28/2018,Once you do electric you will never go back!!!!!!!,5,"Ok, just test drive one. Once you slide into those leather seats and grab the shifting knob and roll your hands over her firm steering wheel then slowly ride her as she quietly drives with that electric drive....mmmmmm so nice.  Have driven 3K miles in 2 months. A quiet ride and smooth. Easy to charge but takes getting used to hitting a button and nothing happens until you shift and give her a little on the pedal. I achieve 25 miles on electric only and forget about that 300 mile range. If it is city driving I have surpassed 500 miles on a single tank on hybrid mode. Regeneration is the key. Let her slurp it back up when she is going down....hill. Quick off the line but a little slow when you want her to run. I bought her to help me lower my carbon footprint and Protect our Winters. My hope is that many find electrics our the way to go and abandon gasoline powered cars. My last car was a 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid. Now I have a 2018 Mitsu PHEV baby steps to full electric. I have driven the future and I like it. Ride is a little heavy but blasting through a snowstorm of heavy rains? This car is a car on rails. It never felt out of control througha 18inch storrm. My problem was getting past the idiots doing 25. I was doing 50 and it was letting me run her. Its a SUV. Lots of cargo space and fun to drive. I really like her.

 Update.... I have had her for over two years now. The mileage is now 34,712 miles. Mostly driven under electric but I take longer drives to go Skiing in Wisconsin and drove last September to Nashville. Can't wait to go back to Nashville. It is one cool city to have fun in but it has city issues with homelessness and drug abuse problems that it needs help with. If I ever get to retire I wish to go back to help. I go tangent, the PHEV outlander is still fun to drive. Gas mileage for me on long trips is 32-35 mpg. I need all the space for my gear and luggage. I have no gradation of the battery after two years. I charge 2 times a day. That is over 1300 charge and discharge cycles. I basically travel the same 24 mile route each way everyday. I get to work with 1 mile of e juice left and get home on 0. I charge at night and then they let me charge for free at work. When I went to Nashville they let me charge for free at the Hotel. Also in Wisconsin I can sometimes find an outlet. On a 220V home charger, It is 2Hrs to cahrge. When I get home I plug in. Eat some dinner walk the dog and then unplug. By this time I have 20 miles stored to run errands on. Works for me. At work it takes 7-8 hrs to charge on the 110VAC charger that comes with the car. I pull in and plug in. After my shift it is fully charged and I unplug, wrap up and drive home. I reduced my commite cost from 6 bucks a day to 1 dollar a day.   They say it can go 22 miles but I have consistently get 24-25 only on electric drive. Once in a great while, when the outside temperature is just right, I may get 27. That is rare.  I don't believe these stories about degrading batteries on this. I drive the same route everyday for two years and the same amount of battery use has been seen. 

 Still fun, still quiet and still loving it. In 20 years, the car will pay for itself in gas savings. No mechanical or electrical problems for the 2 years 2 months owned. Will keep you posted.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Happy Mitsu Owner, 01/16/2019,Make the leap to PHEV its worth it,5,"Updated 18-month review:

This is my 5th Mitsubishi, 1st new Mitsubishi, and 3rd Outlander.  Yes, I am a loyal Mitsubishi customer but I have owned other cars inclusive Toyota, Honda, Subaru, VW, and Mercury. I also looked at other cars during this purchasing process but came to the same conclusion. that Mitsubishi's to have the best value compared to other cars.  When buying a car I calculate the Total Cost of Ownership (purchase price, the expense to run, and depreciation) for different vehicles and time after time Mitsubishi wins.

It helps that I do not care to keep up with status or trends and view a car's main purpose is to transport me safely, efficiently, and without issues.   That allows me to look past the industry reports score Mitsubishi's very low.  I focus on customer reviews, what I want in a vehicle, reliability,  and the financial reality of operating the vehicle.  This makes the decision process much easier since you are buying a car based on your needs and real-world usage. I find both Edmunds and Fueleconomy.gov give you access to the best customer reviews/real-world usage information.

If you read the professional reviews you would be lead to believe the Outlander PHEV has limited range, gets poor gas mileage when the battery runs out, is slow, and loud.  I have found the opposite on all accounts when compared with both my gas Outlander and other Hybrids or PHEV that are rated higher.  My review below points out real-life usage over a year that debunks the negative comments by the professionals. 

Over the last year, I am getting 59 MPG for all of my drives which is double the MPG I had on my old gas Outlander. I work from home so my driving habits are the ideal match for a PHEV.  Most of my drives are short local trips of approx 30/50 miles and I charge my car after almost every local trip.  I am getting 60 to 100 MPG for local driving, a tank of gas takes me over two weeks to use, and I getting 700 to 1,000 miles on a tank of gas.  I  have done many long trips and I am getting 32 to 40 MPG and 250 to 350 miles in range.  The main variable is weather since the battery operates more efficiently in temperate climates.  Additionally, you are not using the heat or AC so the is less of a draw on the battery.   

Having a PHEV on long trips takes away any range anxiety and is more efficient than most vehicles on the road.  I have found long trips provided few opportunities to charge due to availability, time, cost, and ease.  When you have a PHEV that is not an issue since you just need to charge when it is convenient.  I tend to go to rural destinations however even in urban locations options tend to be out of the way, full, or cost more than gas.   On my longer trips, I use its default hybrid mode which gives you great MPG (36-42) and range (350-400 mi). Costs to charge at public charging stations can cost more than gas.  I am getting better MPG than my regular gas Outlander and even my other cars.  Before my PHEV I considered it a success if I got 30 MPG on long trips but now I am getting between 36 and 42 MPG average which is a big improvement and as good as regular gas midsize cars. 

Home charging has been easy and affordable.  A full charge costs around 80 cents and I am getting 20 to 30 miles on the charge.  You get better results when its warmer so in the late spring, early summer, and early fall I have gotten as high as 40 miles per charge but constantly getting 30 miles driving on local suburbans/country roads when not using heat or AC.    When you compare the cost of home charging to fuel cost you save over $2 per trip. I ran the numbers and I am saving over $500 per year on fueling my car with electricity and gas.  This number takes into account both my home electric and fuel costs.  Add this to the tax credit the value of the car becomes obvious.

Outside of the math is it is just a good car to
 drive. Not too big/small, comfortable, quiet, and it can get you anywhere you need to go (distance, weather, on/off-road).  You are not going to win a race in this car but if you need speed you can either hit the pedal and the power is there and if you need more take it out of ECO mode.  It has all the higher-end features you need but it's not over the top.  Most importantly its a car first with a lot of usable technology that makes it efficient and enjoyable to drive.  

My neighbor just purchased a Tesla Model 3 and it is a computer first that operates a car.  I prefer what Outlander offers which is a great quality car that will save you money and is pleasurable to drive.  

If you are in the market for a PHEV SUV or even Car you need to check out the Outlander.  Given that is one of the few PHEV SUV on the market and the only in its price range it will likely make it to your list if you do any research. I hope you decide to make the leap to an Outlander PHEV since based on my findings it is in a class all by itself.

Love the ride, silence, electric torque, versatility, and especially that the usefulness has not been compromised by absurd design. Visibility,  mirrors, ceiling height, standard moon roof with solid blind, self folding rear seats, folding rear seat head rests, touch screen, non reflective odometers and many other little things I do love. My only gripes are the gezillian warning beeps and of little importance, not a fan of shiny black plastic parts on the dash and front grill, even if you call it piano finish poly carbonate.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,EdwardL, 01/08/2019,"Plug in hybrid, comfort, but hope to get a turbo",5,"Its a plug in hybrid, SUV, heavier than my previous own Toyota Prius Plug In, but it is a very solid build car, the suspension and breaking is really nice.  I use to own Honda and Toyota, BMW, and I am surprise the quality of this Mitsubishi, very fine work they done.  But I have to admit, the only reason I buy this car is to get the California HOV sticker.  I didn't think about the HP from this 2.0 IL4 engine on this relatively heavy car ( may be battery and ev parts cause it to be heavier ).  When you still have battery power, the acceleration was ok, but when it is on gas mode, it lacks power and you can feel it.  Over all, I still love this car a lot, most of the time we have 21 miles of EV range after all night 120VAC charging, and if I don't visit customer that day, it is perfect that I didn't have to use gas at all.  I did use the CHARGE mode sometimes just want to keep the range available as much as I can, because driving on EV mode feels much better in this vehicle.  If you are looking for a Plug in SUV, this is the most affordable one, and the interior room is great, much better than Chevy Volt, Prius Prime and Subaru Crosstrek?    The only wish I have on this car is if they can put a turbo charge on the gas engine will be great.

After 1 1/2 year of ownership, it’s still a great car to drive.  Had 27500 miles on it.  There is one short point is the gas tank is too small, if you drive from LA to Vegas, you must stop for gas because it’s all uphill , there is no way you can get 300 miles range.  Either they put a bigger tank or bigger battery, otherwise no choice, you can’t get there.

The 2020 got hit w Covid-19, I don’t drive as much, the EV range is ok, don’t use gas that much.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,ChanZen, 04/16/2019,Great plug-in with good range AND cargo space,4,"Still loving this car. I researched every single plug-in hybrid on the market in 2019 and this was the only one with a decent amount of battery range AND cargo space. The Chevy Volt and Honda Clarity had the best ranges, sure, but their trunk space was limited, no good for trips to the gardening store, road trips, windsurfing gear, etc. And the plug-in hybrid SUVs with more cargo space -- the Volvos and BMWs -- were way more expensive and, to top it all off, rewarded you with LESS battery range. 

So, while not perfect, the Outlander PHEV was a perfect replacement for our Prius V, which got good gas mileage and swallowed cargo with its big trunk but was a dud to drive and fouled up the garage with its gas exhaust smell whenever the engine fired up, something you grow to hate after driving an EV (our other car is a Model Y).

While not overly exciting, I do like the Outlander's understated crossover styling, which aspires towards sporty. It's not too big and not too small, with plenty of room for the kids or other passengers in back. The interior on the GT trim I have is nice, though it is a bit dated as others have said. The tech features are decent -- Android Auto is great to have -- and I appreciate all the safety features, as well as the parking cameras, both front and back. I love the adaptive cruise control on longer drives. I had a home charger already for our first EV, a 2016 Leaf, so I also love topping off the Outlander whenever it's needed to save on trips to the gas station.

Of course, there are some things with the Outlander I'd change: 1) Get driving settings to hold. Right now they reset every time you start up the car, whether it's the regen level or the Auto Hold feature. This gets annoying, until you just give up using the less important features. 2) Bump up the regen for true one-pedal driving. The highest regen level -- B5, which goes all the way down to B0, which let's the car freewheel -- is just shy of bringing the car to a complete stop. I wish it did like the Model Y, Bolt EV or the new Leaf. 

But overall, I'm really happy with this car so far, and it's fit our needs perfectly.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Mark B, 06/21/2019,EV for life,5,"What this car is- an incredible fuel efficient SUV. What it is not- A full electric vehicle. This is a vehicle that you need to do your research before buying to know what you are getting. If you have a daily round trip work commute of less than 30 miles, this vehicle is mind blowing. Monday through Friday, I hardly use a gallon of gasoline. I can go 2-3 weeks on $20 of gas before a refuel. The other day I was averaging about 190 mpg at one point. The times that you get beyond the EV charge,  you have decent fuel economy for a 3000+ lb vehicle. I had a Jeep Wrangler before this, about the same weight, and it's a night and day comparison. The gas engine is quiet and had sufficient power. You'll hardly notice when it does come on. The best thing about this car is all the flexibility that you have when driving. You can charge the battery with a push of a button. My strategy on longer trips is EV to the interstate, then charge mode on highway miles. This is one of the quietest vehicles I've ever been in. When I drive our minivan, I think that something is wrong with it because I can feel the engine through the gas pedal and it's much louder on the highway. The handling of the PHEV is very good, more like a large car. The interior is very comfortable with plenty of room. We did a 6 hour ski trip this winter with 4 people in the car, skis on top and cargo area fully loaded. No complaints.  I highly recommend getting a class 2 charger. You can fully charge the battery in about 2 hours when it's fully depleted. The charger that comes with it is very slow, about 12 hours. You'll need a 240v line for the class 2. Not a big deal. I have a 6 kw solar array on my home so I'm getting free charging from the sun a lot of the time. My only complaint about the car is the limited EV range. If it got 30-50 miles on a full charge, that would be way better. People worry about EV's range but after you have one, you realize that most of your daily driving is short trips.  I highly recommend this vehicle if you have realistic expectations of what it can and can't do. If you want a full EV SUV, buy a RIvian next year. it will cost you about $40K more that the PHEV.

My wife uses it for Daly errands, we charge every time we get back home, on 1 gas tank we are doing between 750 to 1,000 miles! It is the perfect equation Size, Price, Real MPG. We did 1 long trip from Miami to NC and all safety features on our GT are an amazing help while driving, the adaptive auto pilot, and the automatic high beams are 2 features that I will not buy any other car without them! Then the automatic whippers helps a lot in South Florida all year heavy rains.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Warren, 10/06/2018,Dangerous Experimental Vehicle,1,"If you are considering purchasing a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV please look elsewhere.  I purchased this vehicle because I consider myself a proponent of innovative green technologies.  Furthermore, the promise of high mpg/gallon and a federal tax incentive helped me decide on the purchase.  I've owned trucks, SUVs, hybrids, and sedans and all drive similarly due to standard controls.  The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV GT has moved to 100% electronic controls.  This literally means no or little gears, buttons, or dials.  The intuitive instincts of driving are not helpful as this is an entirely new experience.  Most of this is annoying but you will adapt.  Now I said dangerous and here is why.  If you forget to unplug the car from the charger and push the reverse button a signal will appear on the dashboard alerting the driver to unplug the car.  This puts the car in a pause state but you must push the PARK button; otherwise, after exiting the car, walking around to the passenger side, and unplugging the charger will result in the car spontaneously reversing without a driver.  This happened in our garage and nearly killed my wife.  The car was also damaged because it hit my house.  Mitsubishi was unconcerned that a human life was in danger and said to file a claim with your insurance company for damages to the vehicle.  For reliability, let's say you need to get gas.  You go to the gas station to fill up.  You push the gas door button to open the door (remember everything's electronic) and a message comes up on the instrument panel that says fuel system malfunction.  I've never owned a vehicle that refuses to let me add gas???!!!!  Since I didn't have enough gas to get the dealership and the dealership was concerned this was dangerous, I had my 5 month old car towed to the dealership for repairs.  Turns out the car needed a software upgrade!  Bottom line, in my opinion this car is not ready for sales and unethical Mitsubishi is using customers as Beta testers.  Let me also say something about the gas mileage.  It's going to get anywhere from 14-100mpg.  Yes, 14 at the low end.  If you take a long road trip expect to get around 50-100mpg for 20 minutes on the freeway then it will go lower and lower.  The gas tank is very small too so you'll be filling up very frequently so this is not a good road trip or commuting car.  The gasoline engine is completely pathetic and very inefficient which makes no sense to me.   If you considering purchasing a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, just understand your buying an overpriced poorly tested software package and make sure you live close to a dealership because no one will else will know how to work on the car.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Joe M, 10/05/2018,Disappointing Technology,3,"I was excited about the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV.  It had everything I wanted, all the safety features, surround cameras, accident avoidance features.  I was ready to sign on the dotted line.  Then I learned it didn’t have an integrated navigation system.  I have had integrated navigation in all my cars since it first was introduced.  So, I convinced myself that I could live with navigation through the vehicle from my phone.  The I learned that when you are using a navigation app on your phone, you cannot use any other apply play features in the vehicle.  Come on Mitsubishi, what is up with that?  I am even willing to pay for integrated Navigation but it is not even offered as an option.   Very disappointing.

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2018,Horizon 95, 05/26/2019,Beautiful SUV I highly recommend,5,"I compared all the Hybrid & electric SUVs available in 2018 models.  I found this SUV to be the best choice financially and in performance wise.  I was debating between this and a Toyota Highlander Hybrid. After careful consideration of all the factors: price, performance, interior & exterior looks and amenities, and car reviews, buying the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV GT was a no brainer. I have owned this vehicle for 8 months and haven’t regretted my decision. I’m so pleased with this vehicle and I get a lot of compliments from strangers on it. I live in Hawaii where Toyota & Honda are the go to cars and dominate the market. 
I have short daily commutes and love all the perks, free EV parking, driving solely in electric mode, tax rebates, etc... Strangers compliment my beautiful baby daily. I bought the ruby black pearl color and it shimmers in the sunshine. All my family and friends love the exterior, interior, and driving performance as much as I do. I’ve owned BMWs, Toyotas, Fords, Saturns, and Hondas in the past and I must say, this vehicle comes in 1st place for me. The only downside is I wish it had better electric driving range but given everything else it does have, I still love it.

It's a simple vehicle in terms of gadgets and features but everything it does it does pretty well. Overall very happy with this SUV
mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2019,Happy PHEV Owner, 07/04/2020,"Listen to owners, not a professional car reviewer!",5,"I have to chuckle when I read the Edmunds review of the 2019 Outlander PHEV. Along with the Consumer Reports review, it nearly dissuaded me from buying this vehicle, which I did in June, 2020. I am so glad I overlooked the overall negativity of the ""professional"" reviews and focused on what was really important to me. If you and I have similar values, I think you will be quite pleased with this vehicle.First off, let me offer an alternative perspective on the ride and comfort of the Outlander PHEV. My first impression on the test drive was that this looks and feels like a luxury vehicle. I bought the base SEL, which comes with handsome leather upholstery. What other brand offers leather in the base model?! I fell in love with the comfy front seats, which offer four dimensions of electric adjustment to get into that perfect driving position. I'm 6'2"" and I find the driving position comfortable, with plenty of head room--even when I'm sitting on top of a two inch pad! The legroom in the front row is also generous. And I love the expansive view out the front windshield. The sight lines give me confidence.I have not ridden in the back, but my 12 year old daughter says it's comfortable and roomy--certainly better than she is used to (she has ridden Subarus in the past).I will also mention that an electric liftgate, auto sensing wipers, a blind spot warning system, heated seats, and Carplay/Android Auto are all standard on the base model. They work great and add to the luxury look and feel of the Outlander PHEV.So everything the Edmunds pro reviewer says about ""cheap appearances"" comfort can be thrown out the window, based on my non-professional experience!Next we come to the drive. Edmunds claims it has poor handling and is underpowered. I have observed the opposite, which may just say that I don't drive the same cars as the Edmunds reviewers. Compared to the four Subarus I've owned, the handling and power are superior. In electric mode, the power is downright pleasing and the ride is eerily silent. But going over a mountain pass in gas mode (which I did this morning), the vehicle delivered plenty of power and really wasn't loud and whiny to my ears, as Edmunds said. Edmunds also mentioned that the steering and braking are subpar. Honestly, I just don't understand what they're talking about. Of course this car is no Lamborghini but you already know that!So set aside Edmunds' complaints about the engine and handling. If you're a normal person like me, you'll find both satisfactory to pleasing.Finally, I come to the three considerations that ultimately inspired me to buy this vehicle: fuel economy, all wheel drive, and price:1. Fuel economy. Who wouldn't love a full sized SUV that can go 22 miles on electricity and can get impressive mileage on moderate-length trips? Most of my trips are local and so I really don't use the gas engine much. But when I need it, it's there to extend the range to about 300 miles, even with the""small"" 11.3 gallon gas tank. On trips of under 50 miles, you can expect an mpg of 40-110 depending on terrain. It then drops off, depending on how often you can recharge. On the 1,000 mile trip I'm just finishing up, I averaged 28-30 mpg with mostly highway driving and no recharging. In my opinion, that's still acceptable for a large SUV, especially if you, like me, rarely take such trips.2. AWD, baby! I mentioned earlier that I owned four Subarus prior to the Outlander PHEV. There was a reason: I live in a hilly area that can have rough winters and I love the security and confidence that all-wheel drive provides. I have been frustrated with the lack of choices that those of us who care about fuel economy (and who really want an electric vehicle) have when It comes to AWD SUV-type vehicles. Basically, we have a few hybrid options (e.g., RAV4, CRV) and very few PHEV options (the Outlander, the Ford Escape but it's
 only FWD, and the RAV4 Prime. I was going to hold out for the RAV4 Prime, but then I learned that it could be awhile before I got one and also that they will go for MSRP or higher because of demand. This brought me to the third consideration.3. Price. So, the 2019 Outlander PHEV retails for around $38,000--not much less than the much anticipated 2021 RAV4 Prime. However, the Outlander PHEV can evidently be had for WAY below retail. I bought mine in June, 2020 (it was the last 2019 on the lot) for $27,500! If you add in the $6850 federal tax rebate, I'll actually be paying under $22,000 for my Outlander PHEV. That's a real bargain! Of course, it doesn't have EV range of the Prime and it doesn't qualify for the WA State sales tax break (which requires 30 miles of EV range), but still... You'd be hard pressed to find a conventional sedan at this price point, let alone a PHEV SUV. That sealed the deal for me. Maybe it will for you too?

mitsubishi,outlander-phev,2019,LadyM, 10/01/2020,Great EV transition vehicle,4,"I've been commuting in this car for a month now (hilly 40mi each way, mostly freeway), and it's getting about 60mpg overall and 22-25mi of battery range when starting at 80-100% charge each way. A few trips taken without charge manage about 40mpg on the freeway. The styling and tech is nothing exciting, but it's a comfy ride with good visibility and tons of interior space. With no driver input, it seems to prioritize EV mode at all speeds under 85mph until the battery is depleted, unless quick acceleration or steep hillclimbs are needed. My main complaint is that the gas tank is fairly small and so it still requires frequent fill ups with my driving needs. Overall, a great car to drive before transitioning to full EV as their range improves.

I bought mine in fall of 2011 and, apart from regular maintenance, this car hasn't seen any time back at the dealership. The rest of the car, though, is rather unimpressive. Despite the sporty exterior, the underpowered engine makes this car beyond boring to drive and inspires no confidence when needed. The poor engine would almost be forgivable if the car achieved the advertised gas mileage, but after nearly 3 years of ownership I still average around 20mpg City and 25mpg Highway. This is mostly due to the fact that the pedal needs to be on the floor most of the time to keep up with traffic. Mitsu would have been much better off including their 2.4L engine."

Read some reviews indicating it is very loud and under-powered. I have found the power to be more than adequate and engine noise to be a non-issue as well. If you are a lead foot, engine noise will be louder than usual due to the CVT transmission. The car makes use of higher RPM's to power the car for quick acceleration. This has to do with the fact that a CVT does not ""shift"". It's basically one large gear. The car feels well made. I am very happy to own this car after trading in a Mercedes Benz ML320.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2011,darkcoupon, 08/03/2016,Update from previous review,2,"In the past few years the Transmission has started making a whining sound after driving for long periods of time on the freeway. Then it started happening after driving for short periods of time on the freeway, then it would happen after driving up any hill, then after just driving a few miles in the city, then I started getting a warning that said ""Transmission Overheating, Slow Down."" The dealership assured me this was a normal complaint with this year and model and it would go away after changing the CVT fluid at the 60,000 mile service. Had the 60k service done at 57,000 miles because I couldn't stand the transmission noise anymore, but it continued to be a problem. Took the car back to the dealership and they still insisted it was normal. The next time I took it in they said it was because I'm driving in 4wd mode. When the problem happened in 2wd mode I took it back and they said they couldn't reproduce the issue and decided that it must not be a problem. The final straw was after an easy 30 minute trip on the freeway. I got the warning and couldn't pull off to let the transmission cool down, the car completely lost power and stranded me. The transmission eventually cooled down and I was able to drive it again, but the dealership still insists it's either a normal issue or the problem doesn't exist. I sold this piece of junk and will be buying a more reliable SUV from a brand with better dealer service.

Other than this issue, I haven't had any others issues with it. It would be better with a 6 cylinder engine, and if the current engine didn't make the clicking noise, but its apart of the design. I haven't had any road noise issues, and she gets pretty good gas mileage especially when I'm paying attention to the green fuel efficiency line. The ride is comfortable for me, and others who are driving or are in the back seat, and the cargo space is enough for most needs."
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2011,Drosan, 03/07/2016,4 year owner,5,"I have had my Outlander Sport since Feb. 2012.  I absolutely love my car and I have been saying that ever since I purchased it.  To begin, the cargo space is much more than what it appears.  Moving twice with this car has been helpful, I have fit a table and 5 large stools in the back seat.  The key is that the seats go flush which is great.  I am also an athletic coach and this car comfortably fits all my equipment.  Even with the seats up the cargo space is still more than adequate.  The bluetooth comes standard and is simple and easy.  The blue lights the light up with the opening to the doors always receives many compliments and is functional as well.  The turning radios is amazing, I have never had a problem.

In regards to reliability, I have only had to take this car for oil changes and basic tune ups in four years and 75k miles.  Not bad.  

Pros: Bluetooth and sound system, cargo space, simple yet attractive design, great gas mileage, reliable

Cons: Noisy drive

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2011,details, 06/06/2011,"Great little wagon/suv, great value !",4,"I've had my Outlander sport ES with CVT for just over 2 months. I think it's a pretty nice little car/suv/wagon, whatever you want to call it.
I really like the way it looks.
The power seems more than adequate, it rides smooth and quiet, hardly any tire or wind noise, handles great, gets good mileage. At 1400 plus miles my MPG has ranged from 24.3 right after I took delivery to 27.4 on my last fill up in mixed driving, probably 35/65 City/Hwy.
If you look at all the various road tests, the base model with the 5 speed gets very good 0-60 mph and 1/4 mile times, but most of the road tests are done with the loaded SE model with AWD which weighs more and isn't as fast.
My 2WD ES with CVT is quite peppy especially in the manual mode using either the paddles or the shift lever. I've taken my car up to the mountains twice since I got it and the ability to shift it manually in the 6 power ranges of the CVT transmission made going up the hills and back down a lot of fun.
In the reviews they keep comparing the Outlander Sport to the Kia Sportage which is slightly larger and heavier, I think a better comparison would be with the Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe which is very close in size and weight. When I purchased my Outlander Sport in early April I got a super deal, they took $1675 off the sticker price, they gave me over low book for my trade-in, an 06 Kia Sportage, and they financed the balance for 4 years at 0% interest rate. There's a lot of other nice features, the electronics, storage space, dash display, great warranty, etc.
I,m very happy with the deal I got and the car."
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2011,Bill, 11/27/2010,"Don't believe the ""professional"" reviews",4,"Mitsubishi builds a very fine product but you don't hear much about them because everyone raves about Honda, Toyota etc, well they have issues believe me.  My only issue with the outlander sport is getting in and out of the backseat, they could have made the door openings a bit wider  This SUV is basically a Lancer on steroids. Sure its not going to take you from 0-60 in 2 seconds but its quick enough...very smooth and quiet ride.  The panoramic roof I wish would open in some fashion, the led lights are a bit on the trendy side which I could take or leave."
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2011,stanb, 12/16/2010,Outlander sport se,3,"Overall, the car is OK. It is fairly comfortable and stylish. Road noise is well dampened. It is adequate for a single person or small family.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2011,ivand1, 11/06/2011,Perfect City Cross Over,4,"I bought this car for my wife and based on her feedback the vehicle is simply awesome! I personally feel the engine lacks some power considering the weight of the vehicle; however, knowing how to use the paddle shifters do compensate for it, at the end, it all depends greatly on the driving style. On the other hand, features are above the expectations - got to love the blue Tooth connectivity,
it's also spacious and priced around right. 

At the end, I firmly believe this vehicle is conceived with a female target in mind and for that they did get it right!"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2011,strand83, 09/28/2011,Hard to decide if I like it...,3,"I am now beginning to understand why the Mitsubishi dealer had so many Outlander Sports and why I got a price under $16k. While this car looks amazing and offers a lot for the price, Mitsubishi definitely cut some corners. I have two main issues with this vehicle:

1. Suspension - Try driving one on the freeway at 65 MPH and you will feel the car be thrown around by the ruts and grooves in the road. It is much more noticeable than most cars because of the soft suspension.

2. MIVEC valve timing - My Outlander Sport has less than 2500 miles on it. I have had 3 check engine lights. The dealer says the computer needs a reset due to timing. Obviously the MIVEC hasn't been completely sorted out."

The Outlander Sport, which is different from the bigger Outlander CUV, boasts top safety ratings from the insurance institute and the government, very agreeable handling and acceleration, eyecatching styling, and high build quality. The drivetrain is smooth. It's not a race car, but it's got eager power and makes a comfortable ride. The value for the price is excellent. Sure it's no BMW or Volvo but buck for buck this is an unbeatable car for every day driving fun. I really love this car, every bit of it."

I now own Outlander Sport ES.
I've waited 2 months to write this review so that what I say here will not be just enthusiasm that I just purchased a new car
So far the crossover SUV has not let me down once for a lot of reasons... 
1.16 inch tires will be, in the future,
less expensive to replace.
2.I personally feel the basic package for the SUV is a very intelligent way to look at things, less technical devices, less possible issues in the future. 
3.The CVT transmission is very smooth and is not loud at all and very advanced including the MPGs are very economical."
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2012,zx_knight, 12/31/2012,Freshest crossover on the road,4,"Power-
Its lacking in this area in comparison to the others in its class but the CVT tranny really makes good use of the 148hp.
It gets a little fun when using the paddle shifter (The paddle shifter sold me on the car).
Only issue I have is that you cant tow anything, I dont know how that compars to the rest but its a forgivable issue.

Suspension-
This little truck could out handle alot of cars.
Definitely shines above the rest, especially in 4wd mode :).

Seating- Im 6""1 and have 2 children in car seats and we fit with little issue.
Im a lil cramped in the leg department but I could still do long distance trip in it easy. 

I even talked my sister in to buying one.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2012,happydriver82, 09/24/2012,Great Economical Choice!!!,4,"Great overall car for your buck! Before purchasing I read reviews that the performance was on the slow side however its not ment to be a rocket. Realistically it is a 4cyl and still gets more then enough power to take off and if you need more you can use the manual mode to get that more reponsive take off and for passing. But thats how you are getting the most out of your gas tank. Even the standard features such as the bluetooth, paddles on steering for manual, USB are not normally in base models and Mitsubishi is giving it away! Over all great gas milage, smooth ride, roomy, which I wasnt expecting, and sporty exterior. Great Price!"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2012,Carrie Hoeisng, 09/19/2015,I've put the miles on my 2012 Outlander Sport 4x4!,4,"I bought my 2012 Outlander Sport brand new and now, 3 years later, have 85,000  miles on it. Yes, I love to travel. I loved traveling in my Ford Expedition much better but this little Outlander Sport is much more affordable to drive! 
The front seats fit larger folks, no problem. With the front seats fully back the leg room in the back seats is a little tight. And this is a 4 passenger vehicle, not 5, unless it is 3 small kids in the back seat without car seats! The total weight limit of passengers and cargo is 875 lbs so keep that in mind if you are larger.
I have taken this car into the mountains on snow and ice and it did well for a smaller vehicle. It has decent acceleration for a small car. On my longer road trips I get around 30 mpg. Short driving around town knocks that down to about 23. I have never used the paddle shifters, cruise control, remote start, or blue tooth (I have a dumb phone) but can tell you that the seat warmers are a godsend on cold mornings!
At about 60,000 miles the car developed a squeal (at over 25 mph) that changing the s-belt did not cure. The noise has changed to more of a chirpy noise now. My Mitsu mechanic thinks it is the belt pulley. Guess this is a known problem with the 2011 model but they are not covering it under warranty for the 2012. That upsets me a bit as I feel that because I am a high mileage user I am being penalized. By the time this may come out as a recall issue I will already be out of miles on my 100,000 mile drive train warranty. 
I ended up trading this car in when it had about 100k miles on it. The intermittent squeal made me lose confidence in taking this vehicle on road trips. As a single middle aged woman I just can’t take a chance on being broke down on the road. The dealership wasn’t able to find the noise and it never was covered under warranty. I have gone back to a Ford product.

Dont trust the so called ""expert"" reviews, they are too severe with it, but if u read the consumers reviews they are very good.

I got my fully optioned AWD outlander sport in 2012 and have put around 10,000 miles on it. As far as reliability, its been great, though you'd expect that from a brand new car. The driveability of the car is far from sporty. While it may be AWD with paddle shifters, it doesnt offer much fun to the driver. The gas mileage on it is absolutely average. I do have to say, it looks pretty good on the outside, especially with the rim package! If you're looking for a car with good gas mileage or a bit more performance, look elsewhere."

I bought this Outlander Sport in 2012 and it drove from NC to VT on numerous occasions dealing with the salt water of Eastern Carolina and the salt roads in New England and the car frame never rusted (the muffler even lasted the life of the car).  The interior was noisy however, you hear the road quite a bit and the car has absolutely no acceleration despite being labeled a ""sport"" utility.  That said after 7 years (almost 8) and 185,000 miles the oil pump failed which is right around $2k to repair--but the blue book value for the car is only at $1600.

It was mostly me rather than my wife who was sold on this car's styling.
However, in less than a year, we decided to traded it in for a european station wagon and it turned out to be our best car purchasing decision. Having said that, our biggest complain was actually the ride height. The Mitsubishi is in fact a well put together package at a bargain price. We had drove the new Escape, MX-5 and Forester prior to the Mitsubishi but we didn't like any of them even they are more expensive.
We didn't pick the wrong crossover, we simply picked the wrong car segment."
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2012,James, 02/08/2019,"Ah, its ok.",3,"After driving this vehicle for 90,000 miles, I can say the best thing about this SUV is the styling; it makes the vehicle look like a much nicer vehicle than it really is.  The only other good thing about this vehicle is the mechanical reliability.  The rest of the vehicle is pretty mediocre.   The engine and transmission are honest; no mechanical issues, they just work as they should, but they aren't going to have any fun along the way.   Oil changes are extremely easy due to the ground clearance, and simple engineering.  Gas mileage is nothing special.  I've never achieved more than 22mpg in suburban driving, and I could get 28mpg on the highway if I just drove the speed limit.  The handling is okay unless I'm driving on the highway, then it is awful.  I don't know if its the 'sports tuned suspension' or the 18 inch wheels, but it always seemed like I was fighting with the SUV on the highway to keep it under control.  I had the alignment checked, and the vehicle looked over a couple of times, but was always told that it was just the way the vehicle drove.  In contrast to the mechanical components, the rest of the vehicle wasn't built to last.  This vehicle has more dings and dents than any other vehicle I have ever driven.  The only positive thing is, after six years there is no rust and I live in the salt belt.  The interior plastics of this vehicle are covered with light scratches.  It seems that any time I was brushing up against the door, I was scratching it.  It's the most fragile vehicle I have ever had.  Oh, and about every six months I would find some kind of plastic or metal panel from the under carriage of the vehicle in my driveway.  I don't abuse the vehicle, everything just seems to want to fall off.The controls in the vehicle are pretty easy and very basic.  My vehicle had automatic windshield wipers and automatic climate control, but they really weren't labeled to stand out.  The radio has a LOAD button, giving me the impression the vehicle had a CD changer, but alas it did not.  It does have a super complicated and complex Bluetooth voice command system that was probably ahead of its time when it was released, but it does not like my voice, and always messes up.  Ex; ""Call Mom."" =  ""Okay, calling 911"".  The adjustable HID headlights are amazing to use, however every other car that comes past me flicks their high beams thinking I have my high beams on, so they get annoying.  The big wheels look nice, but the tire size is weird, and tires are expensive.  That's actually the reason I traded the vehicle in; I didn't want to invest $1K on tires for a vehicle that had a rapidly depreciating value.  All in all, it's an honest vehicle that I won't miss.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2013,nyame, 07/11/2013,Great Value-Excellent Reliability,5,"I purchased the vehicle about 3 months ago and I have logged just over 3,300 miles on it. It has a galore of technology features, comparable to any of the luxury vehicles out there, at a much affordable price. It looks great from the exterior and drives very smooth. The mpg rating for this vehicle is 24/31/27 but I am now averaging a combined mpg of 32, better than the official rating of 27. I calculate my mpg by dividing the total mileage travelled for a fill up by the amount of gas needed to bring the gas tank back to another fill up and I have done this 3 times. Of course, my city driving is only 20%, back-roads is 60% and highways is 20%.

This is my second review after owning this vehicle for over 3 years. I am glad I made the choice to buy this vehicle. There has been no major problem with the vehicle and all that I have done in the past 3 years is to change the oil when the computer tells me to do so. I bought a case of the Mitsubishi OEM oil filters on the internet and have been doing my own oil change at home. The tires still look great after 3 years and rotate them every time I change my oil. I have had zero mechanical problems and this vehicles just drives. I have driven it cross country from Reno, Nevada to Vancouver, Canada without a sweat. All the electronics and technology that came with the vehicle are all working fine after 3 years. I actually get better gas mileage than the manufacturer rated mpg. I drive this vehicle every day to work and average 33-34 mpg and this is driving in the city of Reno-Sparks.
After 3 years, I can say that this is a great car, for the value, technology and reliability. I think this vehicle is under rated by the so-called review experts.

Car was running very good at hills with 3 people and such load in it. And since this is manual transmission, you get more power than cvt and probably more mpg if you put little more
effort on it. "
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2013,Sidra, 10/23/2015,So upset about the gas mileage - any tips?,4,"I traded in my VW Jetta Sportwagon TDI because I just wanted to move past the heart break of being lied to and ruining the environment, and didn't want the anxiety of waiting to see what VW would do to the car to make it pass emissions in a couple months... BUT I was getting about 40 mpg on the VW, and diesel was cheaper than gas (at the right stations). 
Well, I fell in love with the Mistubishi Outlander Sport (it had been on my short list when I bought the VW), and the dealership took my VW for trade-in so the Mitsu didn't cost me much (same year and pretty much same mileage as my VW), and I felt really good about the weight off my shoulders.  
I set the odometer, and needed a fill up at 270 miles - that's 20 mpg, or HALF what I was getting on the VW, and at higher cost per fill-up. I thought 'let me try the manual controls, and not run the a/c so much before I go marching back to the dealership'.  Well, next fill-up was today, at 260 miles! WTF, Mitsubishi? How can that be? What can I do differently to get the MPG you said I would get? The last thing I need is to feel guilty about my trade-in after the whole VW fiasco!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2013,captain766, 06/05/2013,Shoulda bought a Subaru,3,"I only had 2 concerns requirements for a new car, higher seating position and descent MPG.
With those requirements I completely expected the performance would not impress.
The Outlander Sport certainly delivers on that expectation.
Very unimpressive. 
The MPG rating of 28Hwy, 24 city, 26 combined is just a pipe dream.
I am averaging 22 MPG and my 100 mile round trip commute is 90% wide open interstate (no traffic to content with).
I always watch to make sure the 'ECO' indicator is lit and still only 22MPG.
Took the car to the dealer.
They 'checked it out', test drove it (with same results as my experience) and called Mitsubishi Tech.
Their answer, ""Yup, that's what you can expect"""
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2013,cwd986, 04/11/2013,Mitsubishi deserves to fail,2,"Where to start...rattles galore on a brand new car, idle that wants to destroy itself by jumping into the 3,000 rpm range after the first clutch engagement, that obnoxious chime that you can't disable when the temp hits 37 degrees.
Oh, and come to find out my ""new"" car was damaged in transit, repainted, and the damage was not disclosed.
When I called Mitsubishi about the body damage they wouldn't tell me how much they paid the dealer to fix the damage or sanction the dealer for non-disclosure; in fact, they were no help at all.
In my opinion Mitsubishi deserves to go the way of Suzuki and disappear from the American market."

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2014,Nik, 09/11/2015,"40k driven in a year, and still rocking it!",5,"I love this car. Seriously. I've had my fair share of crummy cars in the past, to the point that it left me paranoid. After having had the outlander sport for a year and driving it 40,000 in one year, I can happily say this car is a champ. Not only do I drive for business and need it to be reliable, but it's really comfy and looks fancy for the cost. 
I've been able to fit a recliner in it with the seats down, and one trip had two medium size dog crates in there too. It's surprising how much it can fit. 
Then there's the gas mileage. Last fill up cost me $27 and it goes about 320 miles on that. 
The sound is great and I love the subwoofer in the back.
Then there's the panoramic sun roof. Anytime a friend gets in the car that's the first thing they notice. 
As for the finishings, so far the interior holds up. I've had cars (vw's, Hondas, and nissans) that break apart or seems come apart. So far the outlander is in one piece. Oh! And I've accidently hit a few things and no Damage shown on the car. Major plus! 
I can't say enough positive things.
Only downside, is if the car is packed with people, cargo, and ac blasting- the acceleration struggles a bit. But not surprising. 
If you're short like me (under 5ft) the drivers seat goes up and gives you a clear view of the road. If you're tall like my dad (6'1"") you can adjust it and feel comfortable too.
I highly recommend this car.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2014,fazzster, 04/02/2014,Great Value,4,"My number one priority for this class is the availability of a manual transmission. Which narrows it down to CX5, Tiguan, 500L and Forester. I already have a brilliant 500L so i don't need 2. I drive 30k miles per year so the VW (having owned a few in the past) are not the most reliable for the long run. The Forester is a solid buy but pricey and boring to drive. CX5 is overall more polished and ""funner"" to drive. Bottom line, my Mitsu has a warranty that makes sense for a high mileage driver and $18k out the door is a very good deal. It drives very smooth and handles quite well for the class. I see 29-32mpg with out even trying and have achieved 34-35mpg on some short stints."

We love this vehicle! Great features, mileage (averaging over 28 MPG per tank, best 31), price, comfort and size capped off by a great warranty. It's not the fastest SUV out there, but it isn't any slower than most of the other vehicles in it's class and if you use the paddle shifters it ups the fun quotient.  I had 4 adults and 4 huge suitcases in it the other day and it didn't struggle at all. Consumer Reports rates this the ""Most Reliable"" small SUV. The hands free system in this car works much better than the SYNC in my F150 and is easier to use. My only complaint is that Mitsubishi cheaped out on the carpet."
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2014,kmgreen, 04/03/2015,Great gas mileage,5,"About 2 months ago, we traded in our Jeep Liberty for a re-po'ed 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. It gets better gas mileage than expected - about 29-31 in mixed driving. It doesn't feel peppy when accelerating but it's my first CVT and I think it just feels different, not bad.  The driver's side has tons of legroom and my knees never hurt on long trips.  The road feel is a little rough -- similar to the Jeep.  We live down a rough dirt road and with 8+ inches of ground clearance, the Outander Sport performs great.

Update: We've had this car for about 2 years and never had a problem with it. If and when we need a new car we'll probably buy another Outlander.
Update: We've had this car for about 4 years and have had to replace the wheel bearings in both front tires. Very expensive but otherwise, we've had no other problems.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2014,Paul S., 01/15/2018,Best SUV Value for the Money,5,"I bought a used 2014 Outlander Sport ES from a private seller and could not be happier with the SUV.  I wanted a 30 MPG SUV that was reliable had less than 50K miles for under $10K and the Outlander Sport is the only SUV that checked all those boxes.  Many reviews will downgrade the Outlander Sport because the 2.0L engine is under powered they say, but while this SUV won't win any 0 to 60 races it's has more than enough power for me and will accelerate adequately in all driving conditions.  If you drive like Mario Andretti and are an aggressive driver you should look elsewhere and expect to pay more both at the dealer and at the pump.  However, if you drive like a normal person you will love this SUV.  It has a great ride and while this is my first vehicle with a CVT, I'm very impressed with the smoothness of the transmission.  Every other SUV in the Outlander's class will cost you a minimum of $2500 more to purchase used and will not be any more reliable or pleasant to drive.  My only complaint is that the 2013-2016 Outlanders only come with a black interior which is murder in the south when your car sits outside in the summer time.  Aside from that I'm a very happy first-time Mitsubishi owner.

Drove it for a year in Ohio weather, then headed across country to Arizona.  **  Have loaded it significantly and it continues to handle well.  **  Tires have lasted well, no alignment issues.  Engine and transmission are smooth (not boisterous) and run out of steam around 65 - could really used a sixth gear.   Generally use PHX highways around 70mph.  No maintenance issues - oil changes is all I've done other than one visit for a recall adjustment by the dealer that was free and painless.  ** I bought the package shelf and cargo area liner at discounts via Mitsubishi and the original dealer, they are worth getting.  Did not get protection for the door sills or hatch sill, should have done that, quite a few touchups needed.  Seats are comfortable. AC works in AZ.

I can't believe this vehicle is below everyone's radar for anyone wanting a smaller crossover. I did all of the research and found that by far this Mitsu was ranked higher in customer satisfaction that all of the others. I decided to test drive this car and was really impressed with the performance and smooth ride it has. It didn't take long to make a decision when looking at the options for this vehicle. We got every option except for the navigation and the panoramic roof... the 6 speed paddle shifters and INVECS -III - CVT Sportronic transmission makes this a fun to drive, sporty compact SUV.

Update June 2017: This has been a great vehicle... The only thing we have ever had to do is put tires on it! No issues whatsoever... I am so glad that we made the choice to go with Mitsubishi!!! Looking at trading in maybe by next year (about the time we get it paid for... lol) and get another Mitsu!!!

Mileage is as good as my smaller HHR. It has good number of airbags. Most importantly, it was the only vehicle in my price range that came with All Wheel Drive.

In May 2018 (less than a year and half after purchase) the alternator went out of this vehicle and left me stranded for hours and hours, finally got it towed to the garage and thankful it was covered under warranty.  Now here I am in June 2020 (2 years from the last incident) and the Transmission has gone out of the car with just over 100,000 miles on it, so it's no longer covered under warranty....of course.  Oh and you can't get a rebuilt transmission so your only option is a new one at the tune of about $9,000 or a used one, good luck finding that.  Guess everyone is having this issue.  Currently I'm looking at over $4,500 out of pocket if I want to repair this vehicle.   So I would be very skeptical of reviews that state this car should last 200,000 miles or more.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Chad, 10/25/2015,Massively underrated,5,"Purchased this for my wife. We had test driven a 2013 two years ago and were disappointed with its acceleration. Thankfully, the 2015 is no where near the same. Mitsubishi refined the CVT and added the 2.4 liter motor which made a huge difference in performance. We love the HID headlamps. Since we live in the country, deer are always a hazard. These headlights have a tremendously wide angle allowing the driver to see deer much better at night. Love it. Also, the breaks are very responsive. Cruise control is great. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is worth the money...incredible for a stock system. We like the physical size of the vehicle...not huge and not too small. Perfect for a small family and easy to drive. Visibility and seating position is excellent...unlike rav4. Rain sensing wipers are handy and work well. The four wheel drive system is much more advanced than most of the competition. You can actually lock the differential unlike Subaru and Honda. Toyota rav4 does lock, but you can only go 25 mph. The dealership was great. And these motors have a great reputation for reliability. Warranty is unmatched by any Japanese brand. Proudly built in the USA. We have been getting 27 mpg in 60/40 highway/city driving. Wife loves the heated seats, auto climate control, and panaramic roof. We paid 25k. Give this suv a shot if you are in the market...don't be brainwashed by paid reviewers/journalists.

Update: car has been completely trouble free. Not a single issue (as it should be) in the 14k miles we have owned it. Still no rattles. Everyone still loves it.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Michele Knight, 09/23/2015,Outlander Sport Obsessed!,5,"I read all of the reviews before deciding to purchase the 2015 Outlander Sport SE.  I live in Florida, so having heated seats was not a big deal for me.  However, it did have to have great braking and great traction on the busy roads.  This vehicle does NOT disappoint.  My last car was also a Mitsubishi and it lasted me 13 years.  That, in itself, sold me on the Mitsubishi line of cars.  To be honest, Mitsubishi is highly UNDERRATED!  I see people complaining about the CVT and the torque of the engine.  It doesn't bother me at all.  The main thing that you must keep in mind is this SUV is NOT an off-roading vehicle.  Also, just because it has ""sport"" in the name, doesn't mean it's a sports car!  This car, for me is EXACTLY what I wanted without going into MAJOR debt!  The navigation system is great, the 9 speaker Rockford Fosgate with the 10"" subwoofer really kicks some music butt, and the panoramic moon roof is incredible!  This car drives like a dream!  The 4 disk brakes are highly responsible and the steering is spot on!  What I really enjoy about this car, is the fact that I can change from an automatic transmission to a manual transmission.  This works out great when you want to get off the ""red light line"" first or, you have to speed up on a highway on-ramp.  Unfortunately, not many people who come to Florida, know how to drive their cars and proper road procedures.  Currently, I am getting 25.6 mpg driving in the City.  Keep in mind, I am also not driving the car like I'm Mario Andretti!  I'm a 43 year old mom.  I don't need to drive like a maniac!  But when I do, this car has the needed ""get up and go""!  I highly recommend this car if you are in the market.  From what I understand, the 2015 will be the last made with a gas engine.  In 2016, Mitsubishi will be redesigning the Outlander Sport with a Hybrid engine.    Regardless of whats to come, I am extremely happy with my purchase!  I like having a vehicle that doesn't look like every other SUV on the road!

I find a feature not addressed by many of the 5 star ratings was the seat and steering wheel adjustments.  You can pump the seat higher and don't have an awkward look out your front window.  The steering wheel adjustment allows additional comfort.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Ron, 04/18/2016,Better than expected,3,"I bought a 2015 leftover in April 2016 because I got a real good price. I bought with some trepidation, considering the expert reviews I read, but noted that most consumer reviews were pretty good. Maybe the experts expect too much from a vehicle because they can compare the vehicle to many more expensive ones. I have only had the vehicle for a few weeks, but I'm fairly happy with it. It is not a sports car, but handles adequately for an SUV. Acceleration is decent, and the engine doesn't seem any noisier than on the Rogue I traded in. Interior is a little less upscale than on some competitors, but is practical and comfortable. The ride is a little stiff, but the vehicle has 18"" '55' series tires, so that is somewhat expected. Exterior is rather attractive, and I'm getting better than advertised MPG. So far, I'm satisfied

After 6 months, everything is pretty much the same. I'm still satisfied. I get about 25+ MPG locally, and around 30 on the highway. The ride could be a little better on rough pavement, but is not terrible.

18 months now. Nothing to add. Still satisfied

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Bravin Hughart, 09/08/2015,"Don't be fooled by ""expert"" reviews! GREAT CAR!",5,"Edit, after 90k miles, not one repair. Tires have been changed twice and normal maintenance. Car is awesome! Are you kidding? Buy it! We mulled around for two weeks trying to decide between the Honda CRV, Subaru XT and the Outlander Sport. The Mitsubishi had the best warranty by a long shot (not the warranty was much of a concern with Honda or Subaru). It boiled down to bang for your buck. We got a LOADED SE Outlander with the glass roof for around the starting price of the other two. We bought the Mitsubishi thinking we just got more bells and whistles but a cheapo car. Well, we were wrong. We just wrapped up a 2000 mile road trip and we were stunned. Economy: This car averaged 31 MPG over the full distance. (Keep in mind this is the 4X4) The insurance rate was lower than the other two SUVs we were considering. Comfort: I have a very bad back and that is the most comfortable I have been in a car since I drove a Lincoln. It rides, handles and stops very well. Power: Many people comment the power is lacking in this car. My wife and I feel it is just right. It is not slow by any means. 70 -80 mph with no issues through the mountains. Acceleration is actually impressive. MPG is the concern for us and this car finds that balance between power and MPG. The CVT transmission is a little weird at first but you soon get used to the shift or no shift depending on where your foot is on the accelerator. I have fun working with the transmission keeping the MPG maxed out. Design: The interior is not Lexus quality but it is as good if not better than Honda, Toyota or Subaru. We LOVE the Rockford Fosgate stereo system with the touch screen and deep bass. The illuminated glass roof is a treat at night. The exterior is aggressive and sporty. It turns heads. We had several people ask us what kind of car this was and they liked it. Value: We feel we could not have done better with any other car. The Mitsubishi dealers seem happy to have our business instead of considering it a chore to sell us a car (Honda, Subaru). We bought this car for work commuter duty. We have already decided it will be much more than that.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Drew Day, 11/12/2015,Diamond in the Rough,4,"Literally the only complaint I have is the finish quality of the interior. Too heavy on the hard plastics (we opted for more of a base model trim.) Everything else is par excellence! The CVT is silky smooth. The 2.4L engine offers plenty of pep. The ride is sublime, very quiet cabin. Solidly put together. Comfortable seating position. Nimble handling. Took it for a spin at elevation on a rainy, then slushy, then icy road - 4WD auto and 4WD LOCK are a must have - offers incredible traction. Confident around the corners and a great feel. Wish for a smidge more room in the back for our big dog, but we are exceedingly happy with our purchase. The dealer was eager to please. Subaru has more brand recognition, but we believe we purchased the better crossover for the money.

Well I had to use it at the 17,500 mile mark. A new transmission had to be installed! Tech at the dealership said he has had several he has had to replace and Mitsibishi knows they have a problem. So why not a recall?

  Will be looking to sell or trade come spring of 2018, mileage has fallen off since new tranny was installed, driver's side power window is acting funny. After 27 months of ownership and 18,500 miles on the SUV, I have come to the conculsion that the vehicle is under powered. It needs a 6 cylinder in it.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,real person, 01/28/2016,For the price nothing competes,5,"I've been looking for a  small cuv and used honda and toyotas are overpriced. Both are great vehicles but you can purchase a brand new outlander sport for what dealers want for the other vehicles used so they are basically taking your trade in for free. The outlander sport has a great warranty and rides really nice for a small cuv. The cvt trans is definitely different than what I'm used to but you can also manually shift it. The 4wd system is really advanced because you can run it in fwd (front wheel drive), auto four wheel drive or lock 4wd when the weather is bad. It stays in 4wd lock until 25 mph the automatically switches back to auto 4wd. I previously had a subaru and really didn't like the fact that it didn't have a similar option.  Fuel economy looks to be below average compared to similar vehicles but I opted for the bigger engine so I knew that. Some folks may argue that they don't have as good a resale but you are paying at least 3 to 4 grand less from the start, so the way i look at is how can it be worth more in the end. I keep a vehicle at least 10 years. I really don't think you can believe the expert reviews completely.  Better off looking at the consumer reviews.
Update 1 Year and 15,000 miles. Put in a k&n air filter getting consistent 29 to 30 mpg. Rear tires seem to wear more than the frontship but will easily see over 20k with them which is good for a factory tire. No real issues except seat cover coming loose. I just put it back in the track with a stick on adhesive. Could not see bringing it back to dealer for that. Do alot of winter driving and they lIke to use rocks as anti skid. This stuff easily nicks the lower edge right in front of rear door wheel wells. Notice 2017 come with a sort of moulding or flare. Mud flaps are probably a good option. Not regrets with the 2.4. Plenty of power and does 70 to 80 straight down the highway every day. Again for the price nothing competes!

Update almost 23k latter. Averaging just shy of 30mpg combined driving.  Just changed out the stock tires. Could of run them a little longer but were getting a little skittish in heavy rain. All in all good vehicle. Real only complaint is a little bumpy with the short wheelbase. For the price nothing compares. 39000 miles......still going strong. 44000 miles still 50 percent brake pads left! 52000 and going strong.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,JCLZEKE@AOL.COM, 03/06/2016,DON'T BELIEVE THE ''EXPERTS'' !,5,"This is my third Mitsubishi. 1991 Galant, 2003 Outlander we still own with 210,000 miles and this 2015 Sport GT. I've owned it for 4 months, 4000 miles and We LOVE it!  I've owned Honda, Toyota, Nissan truck and Chevy's. All good cars and trucks, but Mitsubishi NEVER gets the credit it deserves for a Japanese vehicle of Superior quality and lower price than its better advertised competitors. These are Wonderful vehicles, precision built and designed. Available in the U.S. at lower prices for who knows why? lack of advertising... Take advantage of these deals and get a Well designed, quality built Japanese vehicle for a great price! They run FOREVER with just proper maintenance, the exterior stays beautiful with minimum maintenance. how many times I've said to my son ""OH U washed the Outlander (03)?'' His answer ""NO it rained""...  it looked Great. I Love our new 2015 Outlander Sport, the Rochford Fosgate Sound system is Awesome. Performance with the 2.4L is great, mileage is about 25-26 around town. Took her out in unplowed 14'' of snow in 4WD LOCK No problem at all. Heated seats, mirrors, adjustable drivers seat, steering column... 4WD, glass roof, back up camera, much, much more for 20 something K? Plus 10 year/100,000 warranty.  I love it! All I can say is give it a chance? Don't listen to the """"so called'' Expert reviews?

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,btwells, 04/02/2015,New Outlander Sport GT,4,"I bought the new 2015 Outlander Sport GT. Wow! What a nice vehicle. I got a gray one with the Touring package, Rockford Fosgate sound system, panoramic roof, cargo package, and exterior side moldings. The GT version also comes with the 2.4 liter engine.
For me it drives beautifully. Nice pickup and acceleration with the improved engine. The black leather interior and matching black carpet make the interior fell rich and comfortable. The navigation system/audio system is LOADED with features and looks and sounds great. At the push of a button the ceiling retreats and panoramic roof with its LED backlighting appears-- very impressive!"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,CAL, 02/05/2016,Love my Mitsu!!!,5,"i have been a Mitsu owner for 25 years, and 4 trucks, 2 Monteros, and 2 Outlanders, i have never had any problems with any of them, adn still have 2 of them now. These is a very good CUV, i admit the earlier 2013 and 2014, had a sluggish CVT, but otherwise there were great, reliable cars. But like the other review they get NO RESPECT,  Mitsubishi created the CUV concept, long before Honda hrv, mazda 3,or those others, 
i Got a great deal on the vehicle, and fully loaded for $22k, BECAUSE OF OWNER LOYALTY, CAR WAS VALUES AT 28K.
The remote start, heated seats, auto climate, auto wipers, auto lights,  interior lights, awc, roof racks and 18' wheels. , and more,  and it has a simpe and easy  entertainment system,  and love the controls on the steering  wheel, simple and always works . Not a millions plastic buttons to push or turn. 

it is good in all weather conditions,  if you have the right tires, and have some knowledge of how to drive. 
I really wish they would bring back the Montero/Pajero, or others from the European market.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Emily, 06/27/2018,My best decision ever!,5,"I’m a college commuter, and was looking for a crossover size vehicle since I like the extra room. I didn’t initally plan on looking at the Outlander Sport, but I am so glad that I did! My car drives 40 miles one way, 5 days a week, and I have not had a single problem with it. I live in the hilly region of western PA where we can see some harsh winter weather conditions, but this car (4WD) takes on snow and ice with no problem. I even recently took it on vacation, a 530 mile journey one way, and had no problems. The only drawback I would say about this car is the power. Like I said, I live in a hilly region and I have to step on the gas to keep the speed consistent.  Also, power can be lacking while getting up to speed merging onto highways. These are just small drawbacks, however, considering the reliability and mileage that you get. The road handling is great, and it is an overall fun car to drive. Not to mention, in the event something does need fixing, you can’t beat the Mitsubishi warranty. Don’t underestimate this car, I am so glad I made the decision to go with it!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Paul, 01/17/2016,Love my Mitsubishi!!!,5,"I've had the Outlander Sport for 1 month now, and the vehicle is awesome!! I have the GT with the 2.4 liter engine (FWD not 4WD), upgraded stereo with subwoofer, navigation system, huge skylight and hid headlights. The hid headlights are incredible. The main light comes from a projector lens, but there's also a port for reflected light to shoot out the sides of the housing. Driving at night, especially in dark areas without streetlights, is where these headlights really perform.  I just drove on a 3-lane expressway at night, where streetlights were not on for a segment of the road. I drove in the middle lane, and the headlights lit up the center lane AND the lanes to the left and right. In another dark road I saw a fox on the road ahead of me (the headlights startled it) and I was able to follow the scruffy creature as it ran off the side of the road. Another night I saw a cat on the side of the road that turned around and moved further away from the road.
The cvt transmission really lowers the engine's rpm's when not pressing hard on the accelerator. Cruising at 40 mph, the engine is at a quiet 1400 rpm's; cruising at 60 mph the engine is just below 2000 rpm's, 70 mph results in 2100 rpm's (and the engine is still smooth and quiet).
The upgraded stereo sounds fantastic. The navigation system screen rotates out to allow cd's to be inserted into the stereo. Cellphone connects up to the car via bluetooth (done by car dealer the day I got the Mitsu). I thought my old mp3 player without bluetooth technology wouldn't connect to the car, but it does. There is a usb port in the compartment between the driver and front passenger seats. I hooked up the old mp3 player to that usb port (via the cord that came with the mp3 player) and the artists and albums populated on the Mitsu's touch screen, allowing me to choose what music to play.
I haven't had this car long enough to comment on long-term reliability but so far it has been fun to drive.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,G. R. E, 07/05/2016,Proffessionals are wrong!,5,"Could not disagree more with the Edmunds review. Did they even drive the car or base it on past models? For the money this is the best vehicle available in it's class. This is our fourth Mitsubishi and if this one is as reliable as the others, and I see no reason why not, we will be happy campers! No, it does not accelerate like a Corvette, but that is not what it was made to do. I am pleasantly surprised with how our 2.4 get's up and goes. Was hesitant about the CVT also but not only no problems but it is fun. A top of the line CUV with all wheel drive for a little over twenty grand that has a ten year warranty? Show me a comparison! I am willing to bet 99.9% of the naysayers have never driven one!!
"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Brett, 08/17/2015,Unbelievable car,5,"Update June 2020. Car has 70,000 miles on it. It has been my wife’s daily driver since we bought it new in 2015. 5 years and 70k miles of absolutely trouble free driving taken on very long trips, short trips, medium trips and whatever lies in between. We replaced tires at about 50k, the NPrez stock tires were not great in winter. Replaced with nankang cross sport sp-9s and the car handles even better than before. One issue so far, rust started on the back hatch which is addressed in a TSB issued in 2017. Hopefully dealer takes care of as warranty. Other than that we still feel like we’re in a dream!
Update 2018: just over 3 years from purchase our car has 50,000 miles on it. Not one repair to date, just oil changes and it now needs tires before winter. We could not be any happier with this purchase, mileage has steadily increased since we bought it. On the highway it’s pretty easy to get 30mpg. The car still looks fantastic and current, just could not be happier!    We picked up a 2015 outlander sport se 4wd. It is awesome. The backseat has more room for me at 6'2"" than our Jeep Grand Cherokee. People who think this vehicle has pokey acceleration were not taught how to use the CVT transmission properly. It's just like a snowmobile or automatic 4wheeler. It has a ""powerband"" in the 3-5000 rpm range. If you keep the Rpms in this range it's pretty dang snappy, even while moving at about 45. It has a great ride, it's quiet, it looks great, I don't know what more I can say. LED driving lights, fog lights, paddle shifters, auto climate control, touch screen stereo, backup camera, heated seats, adjustable headlights, I mean. What more can you ask for an suv that costs $21K?!? Oh yeah. 30mpgs and 4wheel drive! It's ridiculous. Knock it all you want, but I'll take a $300/month payment for a brand new suv all day. Try it with any other brand with those options. Good luck!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,jim_photog, 06/12/2015,Wonderful car and fantastic value,5,"I have a very basic Outlander Sport.  Just the type of car I like.  This is a wonderful car with gas mileage in line with the numbers (27 - 30 mpg for my daily driving).  I love Mitsubishi for their reliability.  This car has great acceleration (not sure what Edmunds did not like).  I drive in rush hour in Chicago with significant traffice going at 70 - 75 mph.  The Sport has no problems merging, accelerating to pass, handling, etc.  I have had to respond quickly due to some silly drivers and this Sport responds great.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,BTWells, 08/09/2016,WOW! 2015 Outlander Sport GT one year later,5,"I bought the 2015 Outlander Sport GT back in April 2015 so have owned it for more than a year. Wow! What a nice vehicle. I got a gray one with the Touring package, Rockford Fosgate sound system, panoramic roof, cargo package, and exterior side moldings. The GT version also comes with the 2.4 liter engine. 
For me it drives beautifully. Nice pickup and acceleration with the improved engine. The black leather interior and matching black carpet make the interior fell rich and comfortable. The navigation system/audio system is LOADED with features and looks and sounds great. At the push of a button the ceiling retreats and panoramic roof with its LED backlighting appears-- very impressive!

Best Features:
The sound system is too cool and if you like bottom-end bass you will learn to rock out! Night driving with the panoramic roof open and the stereo loud will make you want to take more night drives! It was easy to pair my IPhone to the system and having the system controls on the steering wheel is convenient . The leather heated seats are very comfy and the dashboard layout was nicely thought out. There is also ample leg room for rear passengers. The gas mileage is also good--my best is 33 MPG and it averages 26-28 MPG on my 19 mile commute to work.

Could be better features:
I am not yet sold on the voice activation of the phone or navigation system. Maybe it needs to learn my voice and after one year of trying you would have thought it would have my voice down pat? And, Mitsubishi should rethink the ""book"" it gives as owners manuals. I find the manuals to be confusing and contain too much info and printed in typeface much too small for my eyes.  And, after a year of driving, the shocks could be better. And lastly, the rear cargo area is small but certainly ample for most shopping expeditions as long as you don't buy any really larger size items. That being said, I really like the GT!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Luke Short, 02/27/2017,Ignore the reviews. This is a great vehicle.,5,"I read the reviews for this vehicle and just knew it was the worst vehicle since the Yugo.   But.....I decided to test drive it and determine for myself; I'm glad I did.    With almost 13,000 miles on the clock, it's only seen the shop for oil change and tire rotations.     HID headlights, LED taillights, Bluetooth, heated seats, climate control, power drivers seat, PW, keyless entry, and on and on and on.   It has every toy I could possible want and it does everything right.   Today we loaded 750 pounds of dog food in the back; 15 each 50 pound dog food.    There was room for more and I couldn't even tell the load was in the back.    I still got 30 mpg on the 30 mile  trip back home.    We drove from Phoenix some 200 miles up to the White Mountains at 75 mph and still got 29 mpg.    1200' above sea level to 7000'.   The seats are a little stiff and the interior has some cheap looking plastic, but it's $10,000 less than any competition and I can live with a few shortcomings for that kind of money.    I paid just under $20k and got this amazing vehicle with a ten year bumper to bumper warranty.   Great mileage, great storage capacity, almost every toy and the best warranty in the business.

UPDATE: Almost a year later, nothing has changed.  Rock solid.  No problems and dealer service from Mark Mitsubishi is terrific.   $39 for an oil change, tire rotation and car wash.   You simply can't go wrong with this vehicle.

UPDATE August 2020:   Nothing has changed.  This is a great car.  No problems; just normal oil changes and scheduled maintenance.

There are much better alternatives too choose from . Last , but not least , Mitsubishi is not interested in the US market , they give us sub par products . I do not recommend buying this small SUV . 
Cons :
Cheap plastic interior
Noisy engine 
Rides like a horse
Average gas mileage 
Average technology 
Too fam small of tear seats 

Pros : 
Great warranty 

Hope this helped.

Good style for what the newer SUV's are today. The ride is very comfortable. Dealer was good and we got a deal that we were happy with. We added the rain guards over the windows as they are great when it is raining. Easy to understand most of the controls and the dealer went through the controls inside before we left the lot. They set-up my Bluetooth phone. We are very happy and this will last us many years. We are retired and don't do much traveling and we have a second SUV. I agree that you need to test drive this to make a decision. Don't sell this SUV short.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Doug, 09/22/2016,best value in this category,5,"This is my 2nd Mitsu. I put 50k + on a 2014 Lancer and never had an issue. Great car. This Outlander Sport is fun to drive, unbelievably reliable and great utility. This is a very competitive segment and this Outlander Sport is very competitive. The value is terrific. We have owned for 3 months and put almost 9k miles on it. Very comfortable on long drives. Looks great too. Mitsub may not be real popular in the US but ubiquitous everywhere else. Definitely check this one out. Plus the dealer in Raleigh is fantastic. After 8 months of ownership we are still very pleased with our purchase. No unscheduled maintenance or issues. I'm seeing more and more of these Outlander Sports on the road so the word must be spreading. 1 year update - Still like this car. Runs great, still comfortable. Gas mileage is still good. no issues.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Robert F Dumlao, 07/20/2017,"sleek, aggressive looking, option packed 2015 2.4L",5,"I have owned about a dozen cars over the years, including two of the original SUVs, a 1975 International Scout II and a 1980 Ford Bronco.  I don't plan to go off road, but the 4WD is handy in Illinois winters, it handles well in wet/icy conditions.   The exterior dimensions are well balanced. Not too long, width adequate and height is just right.  The exterior styling is stunning from any angle, and the overall look of the vehicle is well proportioned.  I didn't need a larger vehicle, I don't do any major hauling, but with roof rails, it can easily handle larger items such as dining tables or bedroom sets.  The Sport performs as good as any mid level sedan or CUV, the 2.4L has very good acceleration and torque, so highway merging is not a problem.  Ride comfort is no different either, but as smooth and quiet as can be expected at this price.    
Interior materials remain basic, dashboard layout is functional, although a bit bland looking.  Where the Sport rocks is the Rockford Fosgate navigation system and 710 watt system with a 10"" built in subwoofer, which sounds awesome at lower volumes, and still keeps rocking at highway speeds without blowing my ears out.    This trim level has all the expected options, power everything, heated leather, moon roof with mood lighting, etc. 
Before I purchased, I read many of the reviews, Many were less than complimentary.  I can say as an owner for 18 mos that those reviews are unfounded.  The Sport not expected to compete with upper end vehicles.   Check out this Mitsubishi and see for yourself.

update 03 25 19:  I have added a Curt hitch with a 2"" receiver for a Thule 2-bicycle rack.  Installation was super easy.  Vehicle performance has not changed.

I am pleased with vehicle so far(500 miles in...) it has all the bells and whistles that I wanted at a most affordable price(compared to similar models and options) along with the best warranty bumper to bumper and powertrain in the industry(The dealer I purchased from adds a lifetime powertrain warranty).  Little things that I liked about this model are the heated seats(they heat up really fast and get quite toasty), backup monitor, parking assist sensors, mirror turn lamps, and fog lamps.  Fuel economy is around 25 mph between city and highway(a little better when I turn off the AWD to 2 wheel drive only.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,palebeachbum, 09/22/2018,Seriously Underrated,4,"We bought our 2015 Outlander Sport 2.4 GT new and have been very pleased with it for the last 4yrs and 42k miles. Absolutely no issues. The vehicle seems well-built, although an occasional interior rattle over potholes and rough pavement has developed. The 2.4L 4cyl. is smooth, peppy, and is reasonable on gas, averaging mid-20s MPG city and 31 MPG highway. The CVT is very smooth and does a nice job making the best use of the engine power. Though I've noticed some shuddering under acceleration at times. The only other drivability conplaint is if we're decelerating to a crawling speed, then step on the gas to go (even gently so), there is a noticeable delay in throttle response, followed by very harsh jerky reaction. It's especially annoying in city driving. The ride is on the firm side on rough pavement. The trade off is excellent handling. The steering is a bit too light and vague, but it's ok. We both find the interior very comfortable. The seat comfort is a great blend of comfort and support. Ergonomics are quite good. At 5'7, I find ingress/egress a bit difficult due to the seat height and prominent seat bolstering. Rear doors are very narrow and don't open wide enough. Backseat room is limited to kids and short adults. Definitely step up to the larger Outlander if your backseat will see frequent use. Cargo space is great for the compact exterior size. I was able to haul a 30""x50"" desk with the backseat folded. The cargo liftover is high. We dislike that, but that's life with an SUV. A station wagon or minivan has a much lower cargo liftover. The cargo floor is relatively flat with a little hump where the trunk floor meets the folded seatback. All in all, this is so far proving to be a great compact SUV for a family of 2 who haul cargo around often. It's a good budget-conscious subcompact SUV worthy of consideration.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Taylon, 09/05/2015,Traded in a POS Compass,5,"Traded in the pathetic Compass for an Outlander Sport. The 2.4 in the Outlander and the refined CVT make the Compass look like, well, a Compass. I was very skeptical after reading other reviews, but really liked the styling. After test driving the Outlander Sport, I was sold. This is a very nice vehicle with an attractive warranty. The Compass has the same motor size and a CVT transmission,  but there is a huge difference in the two. The Outlander Sport rides nice, has sufficient power with the 2.4 and is at least unique. Not one person in my county has the same vehicle. The dealership was outstanding as well. Go buy an Outlander Sport!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,crofoot50, 04/13/2015,NEW OUTLANDER SPORT 2.4 Litre,5,just picked up my brand-new 2015 outlander GT sport with the 2.4 L engine and the paddle shifters . the power this vehicle has for an all-wheel-drive model is amazing I can't tell you enough how great this car is to drive need to stop down and try it out what a difference from the original vehicles they have been complaining about with the small underpowered 2.0 motor . I just got it and cannot stop smiling get to your dealer and road test one with the paddle shifters. The only complaint I have is the real window visibility in the rearview mirror is kind of hard to see very small rear hatch window. 
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Jackie, 03/15/2016,Better than expected,4,"I had to get rid of my 2009 lancer ralliart because it needed very expensive repairs. I literally cried. I loved that car. However, I am pregnant and needed something more practical anyways. My old car had two 10"" subs in the back and no room for a stroller. I knew this car would not live up to that car since my old car had AWD and a turbo. I like driving fast. 

I've been pleasantly surprised with the ""get up and go"" this car has. Not comparing it to my lancer of course. However, a few years ago I had a 2008 Ford Escape and that thing was so slow to go. I haven't been using the paddle shifters, but I might give them a try. I also need to learn better how to really use the CVT transmission. I'm used to a SST transmission. 

I enjoy the upgrades on this model, but I'll admit that some of them seem kind of random. I would've taken dual climate control over heated heats. I think the HID headlights are pretty nice though and I like the accent of the led lights that are always on. The panoramic glass roof is cool, but it doesn't open for fresh air. So that's another upgrade that I don't really understand. The headlights are adjustable up and down , bluetooth audio, rockford fosgate sound system that includes tweeters and a built in 10"" sub in the back, mood lighting on the panoramic roof, rain sensing wipers, chrome accents inside, back up camera. The only thing I feel that I am missing is navigation (which I honestly wouldn't use much) and leather seats. 

Just putting the stroller in the back takes up a lot of cargo space. I kind of wish it was a little larger back there. I know my Escape had more room in the back. 

I plan on keeping this car for about 3 years and then getting my race car again. This time it will be a Subaru WRX STI since Mistubishi decided to end the Lancer Evolution. Kind of pissed about that! What's the deal Mistubishi?!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Jesse, 03/14/2016,"If you live with snow, stay away",3,"I live in Minnesota, and we get a lot of snow usually.  So I thought an all wheel drive would be a great choice for my commute vehicle. Well, when it snows I'm in fear of driving this car. It has the factory Nexen tires I'm familiar with. They are known to be cheap summer tires people put on custom after market rims for summer driving. They claim to be all season with light snow rating, could not be anymore inaccurate. I will be buying new tires before our next winter to see it it helps. But coming from the factory, this car scares me driving in any kind of snow. Even if it's only a few inches. It reminds me of my younger years trying to drive a car on bald tires in snow. Even in all wheel drive it does not handle or stop with 2 inches of snow. 
Aside from that, once the brakes locked up on me after driving through a snow 6 inch snow bank. I couldn't have been going more than 5mph and the brakes did not function and left me sliding 2 car lengths before I stopped. I had no control, luckily I was in a parking lot.
I am very lucky the one winter I drove this vehicle we seen a very low amount of snowfall and I have another vehicle to use.
Besides all of the awful unsafe winter use of this vehicle, it's not bad. 
It had one recall repair already for potential stalling when hitting the accelerator,  which mine never did.
Another problem I had multiple times was with long road trips and using cruise control. It would just stop working completely. When I would hit traffic or non passable cars and turn off the cruise control a few times within a short time it would stop working until I was done driving and had the car parked for awhile.
The acceleration is the worst of any car I have ever owned in my life. It is so slow from a dead stop that I will not pull out in traffic unless the next upcoming car is 2 or 3 football fields away. Once on the road acceleration is ok.

Summer driving is good. On average tank of gas I will average 26-28mpg with 80% highway. Every single fill up I hand dial to see. Winter driving averages 22-25 with 70% city driving.

Overall would I buy this vehicle know all that? That is a BIG NO. After a year of ownership I looked into trading it in and it depreciated A LOT . Easily worth 25% less than when I bought it. If I bought a new pickup truck I would see 25% drop until it was paid off.

This is not a safe winter vehicle, maybe new tires will help, but I'm not sure about the brake issue with snow.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,RaleighEd, 08/22/2020,"Great value, good vehicle.",4,"This review is for the base model, with a 5 speed manual transmission. A bit about myself; I am 6'4"" tall, approaching 300 lbs. I have been driving since 1989, and driving an MR2 at HPDE's at various east coast tracks since 2009. 
I purchased my Outlander Sport brand new after test driving it, despite the expert reviews. Thanks to those reviews, I was able to have the dealer throw in, and install fog lights, and spent only $16,800. This includes the ridiculous warranty they offer.
I've been driving it now for almost 5 years, and will most likely keep it for the long haul as my daily driver. I enjoy it's quirks.
It was the last model without the fancy info-tainment screen, and all electronics have been solid. Speakers are just ok, and the AC is ice cold, but noisy.
In terms of space, the front seats are extremely comfortable, and adjustable to give you a controlling view. The rear seats are cramped, but manageable, and fold down to let you carry quite a bit. Two cupholders in the center console, and two in the door. Nice storage area in the center console for any small things you want hidden. 
It is slow. You have to row through the gears quickly to go anywhere, however as most have you have no doubt noticed, no matter how slow you are, people around you in much faster cars are trying to out-slow you, and you end up being fastest by default... maybe genetics, don't know. The engine is loud accelerating, but otherwise not noticeable once speed is reached. Third gear is outstandingly long to help you reach freeway speed no problem, and there is no need to downshift to pass at highway speeds. I have had no engine issues, or any issues. Let's just get that out of the way, oil changes, and tire rotations have been the limit of my maintenance. Oh, and I changed the rear wiper... it dry rotted.
The suspension on this vehicle is what irks me the most, but I've grown to love the challenge. At times it feels like you're driving a Ryder box truck on the Autobahn. It's due to a soft suspension, skinny tires, and horrible spec alignment. I wouldn't change the suspension. If the Nexen tires that came with it ever wear down, I will install wider tires, and at that point, I'd have my alignment guy give it a slightly more aggressive stance. We're talking the cost of tires, and an alignment, to make this thing handle well, and maintain comfort.
Lastly, it performs well in all weather, and is especially competent in snow, again... on the factory tires. 
I understand people like fancy things. The Outlander Sport is not that, but it's been a reliable, fuel efficient, decently sized, adaptable vehicle, with a manual transmission. That's all I need.
"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,K, 08/30/2020,Reliable and inexpensive.,5,"I bought a 2015 Outlander Sport new at the end of the year 2015, paid roughly $16k before taxes/etc. Main selling point was the warranty and the fact that I could find one with a manual transmission.
I have run the warranty out and have never used it. Car has 107k on it now and have had zero issues. 
Admittedly, it isn't the quickest car in the world or the most feature packed but mine is the base of base models (ES, 2wd, 5 speed), but I would happily buy one of these again for how reliable it's been. Only other downside is it wasn't great in the first winter I had it but a decent set of winter tires cured that.
"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,urrrial, 09/05/2020,Overall a great vehicle,4,"I bought this vehicle brand new in April of 2016. I have 74k on the vehicle now and have had no issues at all with the car. The only thing I have had to do is take it in for a few recalls, plus normal maintenance. My main gripe with this car is the gas mileage. In the summer it seems to do okay. I average about 27 with mainly highway driving. However in the winter I am lucky to get 24. I'm not sure if it's just my car that has this issue because other reviewers have said theirs is much higher. The CVT is not great in this car and I do feel sometimes it is a bit under powered. I previously owned a 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer and the CVT in that was tuned much better. I definitely feel like Mitsubishi is a reliable brand and for the price you really can't beat it. I wish when I bought this car I would have gotten a higher end model. However, for the money you really can't beat it. This has been my daily driver for 4 years now and it is a nice place to spend time. Overall I am very pleased with the Mitsubishi brand. If I ever get rid of this car I would definitely purchase another Mitsubishi. Do not listen to the YouTube reviewers. Go drive one for yourself. You will not be disappointed.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,gfish556, 01/30/2015,Dont expect to much,3,"Does not get great MPG! I only get 16 MPG running around town. Traded in a large 6.0 yukon that got 13 MPG thinking this would do better. Noisy and cheap, They put 18"" tires hoping to give it a better ride but sill rides rough. Its a compact car trying to be a crossover SUV. But for a cheap 4x4 its worth  the money. It does has a great warranty. The SE is way better inside than the ES, But the ES is cheaper to. Dont expect to wow! anyone with this car. Nothing great about it? Except you cant by a cheaper 4x4 for the price. And no towing at all! No class 2 hitch for bikes are allowed, voids the warranty. So forget about taking bikes and kids someplace.

Car slipped and slid down the road less than a mile from my home toward my destination. The Anti lock system engaged and could not control the car.   These tires that the factory put on, are garbage.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,konatim, 01/13/2015,2015 Navigation system SUCKS,3,"The navigation system on the 2015 model uses voice controls for phone and navigation. However, I only recently discovered after buying my car and not being able to use voice controls to enter a destination address that for everything this super duper deluxe navigation system does it doesn't do the one very important function of a navigation system. Which is being able to speak the address you want to go to and have the car actually get you there. You have to manually enter an address unlike the many other cars out there with voice navigation. in my opinion this is one of the worst navigation systems i have ever seen. My little portable Garmin is better and actually works!"

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Kyle, 07/18/2015,It's not all it is cracked up to be....,2,"Firstly this vehicle is catered to a cheaper market i get it but it is none the less a vehicle that should have not ever left the drawing board.  Firstly I am luck to have only rented this vehicle and not purchased it.  That is really dodging a bullet.  Ok picture this a car salesman doing his job and trying to sale you a car talking about all the features in the car blah blah blah. With that being said there are things you would never pick up on when you are on a test drive. So lets get started...First the car is so under powered and is poor at accelerating I think my poodle can run fast than this car. Pretty much don't rely on this car if you need to get out of the way or move out of danger quickly. Truth be told I was getting on a highway on ramp and it took forever to accelerate. Secondly I think they rushed the design of this engine or at least the cruise control system....I'm sorry to say but it is garbage. Why is it garbage you might ask? If it is not busy increasing and decreasing rapidly the RPM's it's busy struggling to keep up with you speed change request. Not just that the way it engages it the most counter intuitive way to engage it. To engage it you turn on the master switch on the steering column, then while you are at the desired speed release the acceleration pedal the depress the set mode then hold the accelerate mode on the steering column for approx 8-15 second to see any increase in RPM, then finally it increases but just maybe 100-300 increase in RPM, then finally it gets up to 3000-4000 RPM. Mind you i'm going highway speeds at level ground give or take. It was more annoying to have the cruise control on than anything so i just left it off for the duration. The electronic information available to the driver is very minimal would be nice to know whats going on with the car while your driving. The entertainment system is an attempt to stay with the times but it has a ways to go....not to user friendly to driver in particular the satellite radio functions. Finally there is only on usb and that is in the central arm rest. Its funny that it has the option for a line in component such as a mp3 player but physically there is no location to plug in the line in... It wouldn't have been for those items to be corrected i would say this car could have the potential to last more than 5-8 years. I can just see the lemon tree grow......Good try Mitsubishi but i'm not convinced.  I'll give it to you though your partners on the lancer side of the house have got it down but this Out-lander Sport needs to be redesigned.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Rojas, 08/17/2016,Don't buy this car you will be sorry.,1,"The car has a metallic chain noise that comes and goes intermittently as you take off or when your going up hills or driving low. You have to use expensive gas 89 the dealership will tell you and you will still hear the noise chain (makes me think of a bike chain dragging) noise after. The dealership even told me to get the fuel injector cleaned and I still get the same noise with that done a few times and with octane boost put in with the gas. Don't buy this car. I want back to the dealer and I was told that the motor is making the SUV make that sound with all the power it need to run the car and it will always make that noise and it would only get worst in the winter time and get louder. I got a new car to have a problem free car not have a lot of new problems. The material that the seats are made with are cheap and the moldings at the bottom of the seats where made very cheap and will come off if you tap them and break. The SUV basically has no trunks you just have a cargo cover over your make shift trunk area and the bluetooth system is horrible you will be frustrated after the car asks you like four times whats the name of the person you want to call and then asks you actually want to call them over and over again. The radio is hard to navigate if you get the radio stereo stuck on repeat or shuffle you have to play with it a long time to get it off. Good luck and don't choose this problem car I want to trade this car in for something that isn't Mitsubishi now. First and last time buying a Mitsubishi. BUYER BEWARE. Don't buy it you will be sorry and in for a big head ache and disappointment.
"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Danno, 10/21/2015,Made in Illinois POS,2,"Pros: decent on gas. Small.

Cons: Small. Unreliable: In less than 3000 miles, this vehicle developed a transmission shudder (CVT), the airbag and seat belt warnings came on, and finally the tire pressure warnings came on. 
Comfort: It's horridly uncomfortable for an average American. Suspension bottoms out when the vehicle is loaded, and It doesn't have anywhere near the ground clearance needed. Obviously not designed for anything off road - not recommended at all. The Outlander might be an upsize for small-statured folks in the country of origin, but if you're over 6' or 250 lbs, fuggettaboutit. 
Convenience: The sunvisors don't extend. There's no aux audio input for an mp3 player. The A/C is weak and can't cope with 105 degree days. Bluetooth does pair up with your phone quickly and phone calls work good. 
Performance: Nonexistent from idle to 3500 rpm. The throttle needs gouged to spin the motor to redline. Highway passes made easily but the car sounds like it's coming apart when flogged. Transmission shifts are atrocious and a pronounced driveline shudder appeared in the first month.
Safety: given the cramped quarters in the foot area, in the event of a frontal crash, you'd be pinned in the car with two broken legs. Given that the airbag lights came on in the first three months of use, the car seems like a death trap waiting to spring. 
Reliability: nonexistent. The car accumulated more issues every month. Dealers are only located in metropolitan areas, for us a 150 mile drive. 
Overall: We turned this POS back into GSA and pray they don't ever, ever issue this model to anyone else.

Even if you have the dial on the last blue square you still get hot air coming out of the vents.  If you are sitting at a red light for any period of time you break out in a sweat.  When driving on a 50-60 mph highway you have to keep adjusting the dial. Even if you run the air condition you still have to keep adjusting the dial.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2015,Vince, 05/20/2020,Bought new for $18K with the 2.4 and happy,5,"My wife commutes to work 40+  miles a day and I'm not into throwing money away on racking up mileage on a nice car.  Been there done that.  So this one was on sale and I used trucar to get this for around $18K new.  I got the 2.4L, no issues with power.  It's a basic no frills Japanese compact SUV.  Decent comfort and had held up.  Almost no bells and whistles.  Storage behind the rear seat is below average, with the seats folded OK.  So why 5 stars?  For the money I couldn't be happier.  It's worked well as a cheap commuter and my repair costs have been $0.00.  Handling and braking is good.  Fuel mileage is average.  Paint and trim has held up.  Mitshu gets a bad rap, but in 50K+ miles I'm completely satisfied with how this has held up.  It's overall dynamics are exactly as it was when I drove it off the lot new.  Her previous Nissan Quest couldn't make that claim nor the Chrysler T&C from before that.  One more thing: you do your own oil changes, this may be the fastest with no jack needed and everything easily accessible. I get it done in 10 min or less.  So if you have your nice car at home and need a commuter on a budget I'd recommend this for sure.  I'm sure used these are dirt cheap.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,John, 06/15/2016,More Than Good Enough,5,"We have been 'watching' the Outlander Sport for several years.  We finally bought a 2016 Outlander Sport ES to replace our 2005 Mazda Tribute i.  The Outlander Sport is a much nicer vehicle and we paid less for it than we paid for the Tribute in 2005.  Why would we buy a vehicle that rates an 'a rare Edmunds ""D"" rating'?  Lets count the reasons:

1.  Safety - The Outlander Sport has 'Good' IIHS crash ratings except for an 'Acceptable' Front Small Overlap rating.  The old Mazda received a 'Poor' side crash rating.  Many newer vehicles do not pass the Front Small Overlap test.  
2.  Reliability - 2015 CR states that the Outlander Sport has excellent reliability.  Models built from 2012-2015 were made in Illinios.  2016 models sold in this country are made in Japan once again.
3.  Features - Comes standard with everything.  You won't need to upgrade or get an option package for Cruise Control which seems to be very common for vehicles in this price range.  Love the usb port, heated side mirrors, rear center arm rest with cup holders, easy fold split rear seat and the Hill Start Assist feature; again all standard.
4.  Performance - According to Edmunds 0-60 in 8.8 seconds(2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Road Test), 60-0 in 119 feet.  Reported best gas mileage to be 29-32 without trying too hard.  Comfortable seats and yes it does have a telescoping, leather wrapped steering wheel standard.  It rides better than the Mazda did and it is quieter too.  You can hear the engine during hard acceleration but it quiets down while cruising.  We don't have any issues with how it handles. Perhaps it is not 'Sporty' but even CR gave it a good (1/2 red dot) Routine Handling rating.  It has the nicest interior of any vehicle we have ever owned.  

Maybe it is true that 'the rate at which vehicles have been improving is staggering' but so has their price.  The  Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3 must be fantastic vehicles if they are really that much better than the Outlander Sport.  The problem is that for the price we actually paid for the Outlander Sport, they are not competing against each other.  In fact for the price we paid there are very few new vehicles to consider and the Outlander Sport beats them easily.  If you are looking for a vehicle capable of handling four tall adults and their stuff there are very few choices in this price range.

If you are the type of person who replaces their vehicle as often as their iPhone then the Outlander Sport is probable not for you. But if you are like many Americans who agonize over every dollar spent you need to at least consider the Outlander Sport.  Compare it to the one you are currently driving not to one that will put you in debt forever.

--------------------------------------------- Update -----------------------------------

We took our Outlander Sport on a trip.  We started where the speed limit was 65 MPH. It then turned to 70, then 75 and finally 80 MPH.  It made little difference, many drivers always go 10-15 mph above the limit.  At least the semis seem to stay in the 65-70 MPH range. We cruised at 75 MPH for a couple of days including mountain passes.  We then went up twisty switchbacks to 11,000 ft to get to a cabin.  The Outlander Sport did well.  Noise was something of a problem on certain sections of the highway while on other pavement it was very pleasant.  When the time comes we might try some different tires (Michelin Defenders) to see if that helps.  The Outlander Sport rode well.  I detected a little 'float' while driving around a bumpy corner once but no one else in the vehicle noticed anything.  After 6000 miles our best gas mileage was 34 MPG, our worst was 27 MPG.  Overall we are very pleased with our Outlander Sport.  It isn't a Toyota Camry on the interstate but then again I wouldn't want to take a Camry on some of the dirt roads we ended up on.  One improvement we made to our
 base model was to add tweeters to our front speakers.  The wiring and everything is already there so it was pretty easy to do and really added to the overall sound quality.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Rob, 08/31/2016,Hidden Gem,5,"This 2016 Outlander sport SE 2.4 AWD is the best kept secret. As others have said it is underrated for sure, it is quiet, good MPG, CVT transmission is far better than the DCT (duel clutch transmission) many makers are putting in their models. So called expert reviews are really lopsided on this vehicle, Before you buy one of the EXPERT best rated models, go with the consumer ratings and give this hidden gem a try, I did and I am more than satisfied I made the right choice.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Vermonster, 12/01/2016,Why aren't there more of these on the road??,5,"Update:  I've now have my car for a winter and spring and have nearly 15,000 miles on it and am still very satisfied with it.   This car got me where I needed to go in all road conditions with no problems - but I should mention that I did put studded snow tires on for better traction when my road is icy.  I would just add two downsides I've discovered.  First, slush, snow or mud on the inner side of the rims can cause the tires to be out of balance and make the car to shimmy.  When I wash it off, I still have to dig around the rims to make sure it is totally clean or it continues to shimmy.  I may try different rims.  Second, the low beam headlights create a distinct line so that only the immediate road in front of you is lit and nothing high (above car height) or in the distance is lit.  You get good lighting only on the high beams. Those things aside, I would still highly recommend this car.  

Original post:  I've been looking at cars to replace my 2009 Suzuki SX4 for a few years now.  That car's only good review was that it was the least expensive 4WD vehicle on the market at the time.  But it is still running great with almost 160k miles and hasn't a spec of rust on it.  Needless to say, because of that, I read expert reviews a bit skeptically.  I've always liked the look of the Outlander Sport and, in doing my research, kept coming back to it despite the mediocre expert reviews (these reviews seem to place more emphasis on things that are not important to me anyhow).  I finally bought one last month.  Basically, I needed a vehicle to get me to work and back.  I'm not going to be driving the Autobahn or loading up with gear or kids or am trying to impress folks with an overpriced luxury brand name.  I need a dependable AWD/4WD car with good ground clearance because I live in Vermont and have to travel 2½ miles on a hilly dirt road to get home.  This road turns to muddy soup in spring and, of course, we usually get lots of snow, ice, etc, for 5-6 months of the year.  A Renegade and a VW Tiguan were in the running but both didn't get great reliability ratings from customers (I always read the customer reviews!).  I didn't need any bells and whistles, but I ended up with the SE model and am having fun with the infotainment system and love the heated seats!  I like that this car has the push-button mode of driving like my Suzuki that allows to you to easily switch from FWD to 4WD to 4WD low.  I also like that there is a manual mode with the automatic.  I can go down my road in 3rd gear and not have to brake or give it much gas.  I don't notice anything different about the CVT shifting that the experts mention.  There are only 6 gears (unlike the Renegade, which has 9) so that mean less shifting, I supposed.  The MPG is about on par with the Suzuki at 25 mpg combined, but considering this has a larger engine, I'm okay with that.  I need the extra power to get home much of the time.  The car also just feels very solid - nothing tinny about it.  My only low marks are because of the back seats.  There is plenty of room back there, but they just aren't that comfortable.  Fortunately, I rarely have backseat passengers.  So, if you want a very reasonably priced, dependable, solid vehicle that'll be good transportation, this car is definitely something you should consider.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Valerie, 07/19/2016,Best compact suv,5,"I had a 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander but wanted a smaller suv with 4wd option. I looked at Honda HRV, Mazda CX5, Nissan Rogue, Kia Sportage and none even compare to the Outlander Sport. My requirements are good stereo and satellite radio. You have to buy top of the line trims with the others to get this. The SE trim also has push button entry which is a great safety feature and means no searching for keys. The chrome on the front makes it look expensive.   The AC is very cold which is awesome because we are having record high temps this summer. Lets not forget the 5 year warranty and roadside assistance (which I never used on my last one).  Please ignore the ""expert"" reviews and look at consumer reviews for past years.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,DB, 06/26/2017,Exceeding my expectations....A lot.,5,"I bought the Outlander Sport ES with the AWC. I checked on several competitors  and like the Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Patriot, Ford Escape, Honda HRV.  The actual selling price for all of these was far higher (Thousands). In addition, the Jeeps have people complaining about reliability issues.  I got the Outlander Sport with 4 wheel drive for about what a loaded Ford Focus would cost.  The build quality of the Outlander is very good, body gaps even, paint quality is great. Interior is well laid out and nice.  The seat materials look durable and though firm, the seat comfort is not bad. It is not a Dodge Hellcat performance wise, but again, It is better than you would expect from a 2.0 Four cylinder.  When you add a 5 year 60 thousand mile bumper to bumper and 10 year 100 thousand mile power train warranty, I just can't figure out why you don't see more on the roads.  I can recommend this great little crossover with zero reservations.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Lucky 7, 08/05/2016,"Objective review, I won this car in a drawing.",4,"I was not in the market for a small SUV and it is not really my thing.  I just sold an S2000 sports car, drive a BMW 328i and was shopping for a new Boxster so the Outlander sport was not really in my wheelhouse.  And then a telephone call came that I was a finalist to win one in a drawing I had entered online.  I went to the final drawing and won the car.  I had been helping my sister shop for a small SUV so I was very familiar with the Rav4, CRV, Mazda CX4 and the Escape having looked at all of them with her very recently.  We did not look at the Outlander Sport and that was probably a mistake, and the big mistake comes in value for your money.  After I won the base model 2.0 I was allowed to drive a loaded GT model with the larger engine.  First, skip the base 2.0 and go straight to the 2.4.  I drove around and the car did not have as much power for what I was used to and I had never personally driven a CVT car but it was decent.  I am used to cars with lots of power and thought I would be severely disappointed, but I wasn't.  I don't drive like a maniac and for a car to commute comfortably in, this car will do fine.  I spent some additional money to upgrade my base model to an SEL model which the dealer sells for No haggle at $23,500 with the current rebate structure. It has proximity keyless entry, leather seats, a backup camera, a decent touchscreen audio system, bluetooth, the larger engine and all the other common features like power windows and cruise, and I almost forgot, AWD.   The only features I did not pay extra for were the panoramic roof (kinda cool) upgraded stereo and Nav.   So the car was pretty loaded for a low price compared to the competition and has a very comprehensive warranty (10 years 100,000 miles on the engine and transmission, 5 year 60,000 bumper to bumper).   The car rides and drives well, is fairly comfortable, and has lots of features for the price.  There had been some quality issues in the past from a factory here in the US that was closed, and all Outlander Sports now come from Japan and the quality seems very good.    Of the competition, most have better engines, better fuel economy, some have better interiors, maybe a little more space, or drive sportier.  But the Outlander  Sport offers a pretty good little car for a very low price with lots of content and a top notch warranty.  I was going to trade mine but I am keeping it.  It is a neat little car that does a lot really well, just not very fast.  It could do with about 15 more horsepower and 4 more miles per gallon to better compete but those are my major gripes.  If you are in the market for a small SUV/Crossover and want a lot on a small budget, give it a look.  You might be very pleasantly surprised.  Just be sure to get the 2.4 liter engine.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Bob S., 04/19/2018,Authentic Japanese Import,5,"Outlander Sport/RVR/ASX is the best small SUV available worldwide. This has excellent all around quality because it is built at their flagship factory/r&d center. This SUV feels very foreign compared to the competition. This is an authentic Japanese SUV built mainly for Asia and Russia as demonstrated by the voice activated system speaking in Japanese and the driver information screen originally showing Japanese or Russian before being reset.  Paid less for a new Outlander Sport than I paid for a car in 2000. The only bad thing about this SUV is that it is only 96% made in Japan while the  2018 Outlander Sport is 99% made in Japan, and the 2017 Outlander V6 is 100% made in Japan. This is the best vehicle for quality and reliability I have ever owned.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Chuck D, 03/04/2017,Best kept secret!,5,"2016 Outlander Sport SEL. After looking over all the contenders in this type of vehicle none could come close to matching the low price of the Outlander Sport SEL.  The SEL was better equipped and thousands less with a better warranty.( I paid 23k out the door for it ) The ride is comparable to the rest, though interior noise is a bit louder. As far as room goes I brought home a 65 inch smart tv in the Outlander and it fit no problem. Fuel milage is averaging about 27 and that is in hilly Kentucky. Best was 32mpg on a road trip to Chicago.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Lisa, 01/07/2017,Great find!,4,"We were cruising through a car lot and said ""what's that?!"" It looked like something we couldn't afford but we were wrong. So far, we've really enjoyed this car. It's fun to drive and great in the snow. It also handles much better than our previous 2008 Honda CRV. Minor cons would be that the interior is very basic and the cargo space is limited. Overall, great value.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Mitsubishi driven, 04/04/2020,Not for the enthusiastic,4,"She’s sluggish on takeoff and drives a little stiff. This car won’t win a 1/4 mile drag, but it is a great all around vehicle that offers decent gas milage. I have 2 of these, I enjoy the maneuverability in tight spots and the sporty look that sets it apart from similar style cars. What it lacks in “fun”’ driving it makes up for in “reliability.” The push button 4WD option comes in really handy vs the AWD of it’s larger full wagon version.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2016,Buddy on the road, 11/19/2020,Buddy on the road,5,"I have been a customer since1989. I currently own a sport outlander, I love it. I don't need super fast acceleration, it's kept me from making risky maneuvers. If a theft is attempted, the car just breaks down. I love the understated style (incognito). I reside in Downtown Detroit and the car insurance rate is bearable. It safely gets me from point A toZ. Service from dealership is very good. Can't beat the warranty. A satisfied customer."
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,Mike, 05/16/2017,"Great value, nice little suv",3,"I've owned Toyota Corolla's the last 15 years, and after not being happy with the last one, decided to try something different.  I always liked the muscular looks of this car, and test drove all it's competitors before giving it it a try.  The 2.4 liter has plenty of passing power, and I get low 20's mpg, doing almost all city driving.   Highway is close to 30.    For under 20k, I got 4wd, push button start, tinted windows, heated seats, and 10 yr/100,00 mile warranty.  

*** Update.  After owning this car for 2-1/2 years I traded it in.  The seats are terribly uncomfortable.  I took it on a 7 hour road trip and my back was killing me half way through.   My phone's Bluetooth has connected with every car except this one.  So no hands free.  Gas mileage isn't great.   The USB port didn't work, so couldn't charge my phone or play music from it.   

This is a good, reliable, inexpensive car, but if you're looking for a better driving experience, I would go with another brand.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,GopinkGo, 03/05/2017,Underappreciated little SUV,5,"Mitsubishis are vastly underappreciated. They are usually LOADED with features, and they are animals in the snow. I drove a 2004 Galant until it just gave out, and we bought this Outlander Sport. I adore this car. There are really amazing features, like heated seats, that are available in trims below the GT. The panoramic roof is bada**, and it rides and handles curves amazingly. Plus with rain sensing wipers, the FAST key system, it has everything and more. Bonus, because they're so unappreciated, they're also underpriced.

**UPDATE** I have been driving this car for close to 7 months now.  I still love this little SUV.  My husband and I have hauled a ton of stuff, and the 60/40 seat split is super helpful.  All in all, a wonderful car!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,KG, 08/23/2017,Glad I purchased it,4,"I bought a 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport brand new for 16,990.00 .  I researched the hell out of it but never test drive one. Edmunds gave it poor reviews but I noticed owners have it great reviews. I test drive toyota rav4 and the new chr and then the outlander sport. I felt the outlander was way better than the toyota and the price was even better. It accelerates just fine for the small engine and the transmission seems great too. Ya it's not a Mercedes or BMW but that was not the prissy kind of vehicle I wanted.  I wanted a vehicle to drive. I am not a snow flake and know how to use mirrors to back up. I have a smart phone for navigation and those items were judt an added expense on other vehicles. Bottom line us I am honestly impressed with the handling acceleration and the look .  I could afford a BMW or Mercedes but am comfortable in who I am that I don't need a sub like that, the outlander is perfect for me and how I use it. 02/25/18. Still glad I bought this ride. The drive feature let's me choose front wheel drive, all wheel, or 4 wheel drive perfect for MN Winters. I was surprised on the stock tires it came with but do think an upgrade will be better.  Put another 4 k miles on.  Really line this vehicle. 02-25-19 Update review on my Outlander port, so I have basically had my Outlander for a year and half, I still only have 11,000 on it (have a work vehicle so I don't drive much).  I still like it and am glad I purchased it. Planning on a long road trip from MN to Colorado Springs soon and have no concerns, couple of back backs, camping gear and a dog will be no problem. I have hauled some loads in the back over 400 lbs- no problems

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,Jim D., 03/29/2018,3000 lb piece of crap!,1,"At first, I loved this car, but after 1 year, I was done! In that year, I've had the a/c compressor and condenser replaced, driver's seat replaced, headlight assy replaced, coils replaced, it would never shift, so I had to drive it in manual mode most of the time, it had ZERO pickup, so much so that I had to mash the accelerator to merge into traffic, then the torque steer would nearly pull you off the road. The dealer would always say ""it's normal"", until the parts finally failed altogether. Near the end, they replaced the transmission, which helped for about a week, then back to poor performance again. Two weeks after the transmission was replaced, all the dash lights came on, engine overheated! Pulled over and popped the hood, no coolant....ANYWHERE! Not a drop in the radiator, coolant tank, no spray in the engine compartment...none. dealer picked up the car, and after 3 days said I had a hole in the radiator, complete BS! I've worked with cars as a job for over 25 years, that was the first thing I checked. Called mitsubishi for help, THEY BLAMED ME FOR TAKING THE CAR TO THEIR DEALERSHIP!! They refused to anything but replace the radiator. I drove to the dealership and handed them the keys, told them it was their car and their problem and walked out. Worst car I've ever owned, and worst dealership I've ever dealt with. Avoid mitsubishi at all costs, the company refuses to stand behind their product, and will blame YOU for their incompetence.
"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,Richard, 06/18/2017,Better than expected,4,"The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES had gotten some poor reviews from professionals.   Had I read those poor reviews beforehand I wouldn't have bought this vehicle, but so far I'm glad I did.  I've had it 2 weeks, but I'm impressed with it.  Steering is much better and tighter than reviewers claimed.  Quick turn radius.  Front seats could use some more support for us with longer legs.  The very tall headrests are unnecessary and blocks view looking back but i guess are more for neck protection in an accident.  It is a small engine, but since i don't haul any cargo or any other people around often it is fine for me.  My daily commute is either 40 mph speed limit or 55 mph on the expressway, so who needs more power than that?   not me.   The ride at those speeds is good and smooth.  Braking is quite good and responsive, as I've found out already.  The CVT does take a little bit of time to get used to, as it's much different than my old Oldsmobile transmission, but nothing here to complain about.  I LOVE the standard 18"" tires on good looking alloy wheels.  No cheap plastic rim covers.  The stereo interface is a rather plain and lame looking (but perfectly functional), but the USB port and bluetooth works great for my MP3 player.  Standard armrest is cool (wish it was a bit larger).  Comes with 4 floor mats, which some SUVs charge extra for.   The big plus for me is the super warranty.  10 years on powertrain, 5 years roadside assistance, and 7 YEARS FOR RUST!!!  Rust warranty is important for me since I live in Chicago and don't have any indoor parking.  My previous car completely rusted out at the bottom.  So don't let the negative reviews bother you.  They should review a vehicle for what it is, not for what it isn't.  So far I think I made a good decision to buy this vehicle.  But as always, time will tell.  I paid $18,563 after taxes, title, fees and rebates applied.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,Slater Alden, 04/25/2017,Base with a manual transmission is the way to go!,5,"Just bought a brand new 2017 Outlander Sport and I must say that it is truly extraordinary when you consider the price of it. Although it is a relatively small car, it being a compact crossover, it feels incredibly solid and planted while driving. The steering feels great, I honestly thought it was a hydraulic because it's so communicative but no, it's just a really well done electric one. And the steering wheel itself ups the entire value of the car, it feels much nicer than others at this price. Seriously, I get more feeling from this Outlander Sport than new Mercedes and BMWs. Also the manual transmission is the way to go. If you don't know how to drive a manual then learn. It's worth it. The clutch throw is short and it engages near the bottom, where you would expect it to. The shifter is a little long but considering it's an SUV it shouldn't be short and notchy like a sports car. Pretty much the manual ups the useable power of this car because it's always right were you want it instead of having to wait for the CVT. I got everything bone stock and am very happy at all of the options is has. One of the things this car gets dinged for by 'expert reviewers' is that it doesn't hold up to all of the little tech features like push button start. Sorry but I just don't really care about things like that. It has a key fab so... yea, I'm good. All in all, do some research in a 200 mile radius from where you live and find a great deal. Drove 5 hours away to a different state but got 5k off sticker price. Very worth it.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,Ric Williams, 12/11/2017,fun,4,"I wanted my wife to get the Outlander but , after she drove both the sport and outlander, she liked the look of the sport better. We drove it for a week and were enjoying it but, after a day trip we took, we fell in love with it. You can not go by the professional reviews.  Read the one by owners . the wind , road and engine noise was not bad at all. Has good pick up. Great gas mileage. Using hands free phone and text has great sound. I enjoyed it so much, I went back and bought an Outlander for my self. I will say, Mitsubishi could make the seats a little more comfortable ( they are average). I have day running lights but, not auto( LE or SE package). They need to put auto with day running . They need auto dim on rear view mirror on the LE/ SE models. The price is 2000-3000 less then any other brand. Mitsubishi builds a great car for a great price.
"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,John R D, 01/12/2018,Actually bought it instead of the Subaru Crosstrek,5,"The visibility for the driver is great.  I backed out of the Crosstrek because it honestly was useless trying to look out rear window. The 2.4 is plenty peppy.  Seems every professional review comments on the power and they mainly describe to 2.0.  The technology is usually a reason the professionals down grade this SUV but I really did not want to buy all the expensive tech stuff (but much of it is available).  Ride is fine and i did not notice any real difference from the Subaru. The Honda HRC was another option - worse visibility than the Crosstrek.  I wanted a small SUV and found this body style way more useful than the fastback styles.  With Nissan buying 34% ownership in Misubishi in 2017 (by far the majority owner) I am comfortable for future service.  For a bit less than similar equipped rue and honda I got over 8"" ground clearance, 168 hp, very acceptable ride, noise etc. My purchase price included total coverage for 10 years or 100,000 miles with a vanishing deductible.  Mitsubishi has been a leader in 4 wheel drive systems for years.  Value for the dollar, reliability and warranty, a dated but still one of the best looking small suv forms are some of my reasons for buying.  In the end I could not be ""brand shamed"" into not buying this car.  We have owned the Imprezza before in our family - good car some flaws but over all reliability is average in most reviews.  I'm really glad I looked at this cat.  It is our second car our bigger vehicle is a Honda Pilot 2013.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,MNBobster, 09/28/2018,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SE 2.4L AWD,4,"If you are looking for a luxury vehicle, this is not it. If you are looking for a competent small SUV that seats 4 comfortably and 5 in a pinch, this should be high on your list. I got mine well-equipped for 19.5K with door jamb and rear bumper guards (well worth it). It is super smooth with the CVT transmission. No ""shift points"", just smooth power delivery. The heated front buckets are great in the Minnesota winter, but don't breath very well in hot, humid weather (black interior doesn't help either). The entertainment center has a so-so touch screen and it occasionally seems to reset itself when you shut off the car and start it later. The USB port is in the center console, and I wish it was in the dash. However, the sound is quite good from this system. Whoever did the TS interface for this needs to make it work better. The climate controls and heated seat switches are kind of a reach. I see they moved them up in the new SUV they introduced recently. The drivetrain is great, and it is very competent on snow and ice. The brakes are powerful and smooth. The backup camera is offset 6 inches, which makes backing up a little screwy, but it works. The keyless entry is a bit confusing. A lot of the entry alarms are programmable, but the easiest way to lock it and unlock it is by the buttons on the outside door handles and tailgate. It is my second Outlander Sport. My 2016 was totaled by a red light runner who pinballed a Cooper Mini into my grill in a snowstorm. I really like this SUV and would buy one again (I did right after the accident).
3/28/2019 After 1 year everything I wrote before hold true. One last criticism is of the wipers and washers. A giant blade in front of the driver and a smaller one on the passenger side works, but not well. The washer fluid squirts instead of spraying, which doesn't work the best. The rear washer squirts down one side, so you need more fluid to get the whole wiper area. Don't get me wrong though. I love my Outlander Sport. Like all vehicles, it could be better. 3/29/2020 I now have 42K miles on it and it has been very dependable. No issues whatsoever. However, it needed new tires and installed Goodyear Assurance All-Season tires. The original tires wore out rather quickly and were not confidence inspiring. The Goodyears are a major upgrade. Still don't like the 37 degree ""possible icy road"" warning. Very annoying and ridiculous. I think I can tell when roads are icy here in MN. We had a rental Ford Fusion while my wife's Toyota was in the shop and it's keyless doors worked a lot better (no button pushing). The Fusion also had wipers that pushed inside out (swipes from center to edge) instead of side to side.That works a LOT better. I still like the Mitsubishi and would buy one again.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,Justin Time, 08/06/2018,True Sleeper,5,"My 2017 Outlander Sport is the first ""import"" I've ever owned. Probably owned or driven [because of my work] over a hundred different vehicles and this is hands down my favorite. I bought an end-of-the-year base model with the 2.0 and manual 5 speed for $15,000. out the door price. The standard equipment on this car is impressive. Power windows, cruise, stereo with cd player, hands free Bluetooth for phone and that standard Mitsubishi warranty that's second to none. The first new vehicle I ever bought had AM radio as an option to be negotiated…..otherwise, just a blank plug in the dashboard! These cars were assembled in Illinois until late 2015, but moved their operations back to Japan after the U.S plant closed. I had done my research on Mitsubishi before that and thought I was buying an American built car- but, once I took it for a test drive, I knew I was going to buy it regardless. Stable ride, plenty of power with the 5 speed, quiet, nice climate control, great heater, availability of parts should be fine with Nissan being an international partner. They've been making automobiles since 1917 so..... not new to the game. Love driving this car!

We considered tons of other vehicles, from the crosstrek, to a rav4, and escape in the same range. What sold us was the price. With my corporate discount we got a brand new 4x4 out the door for $17k, no other 4x4/awd setup came close to that price. I couldn't justify an extra $6k for a competitor's option. Being in the Lake Erie snow belt we needed ground clearance and 4x4 to get through the 17ft of yearly snow. With a set of smaller 16"" winter rims/nokian tires it's gone through anything including a 2ft snow drift in the driveway. Mileage wise is not bad at 24 city/29 hwy, my older forester barely cracks 20mpg city. One negative is a car seat in the back is pretty cramped, we have to move our seats up pretty far to travel with our 4yr old niece.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2017,Jmoore, 09/07/2020,Great value! Buy a GT!,4,"I live in southwestern PA, so 4wd is a must.   I was looking for an affordable, reliable suv, hopefully with a sunroof, great stereo, and leather seats, and with a budget around $15k.   I did my research and decided to test drive one of these, despite the reviews saying the ride quality is poor.  I was very much impressed, this is not a luxury sedan, so expecting it to be is ridiculous, but it compares well with my son's Nissan Rogue in terms of drivability and road noise.  I have no idea why the reviews are critical in this area.   The 2.4 is very responsive, and I'm getting 22mpg around town.  The seats are firm, but comfortable, cargo space is very good, I added a roof rack and a tow hitch for a bike rack and have been hauling my bikes and a kayak easily.   I've fit two 15 inch Yamaha speakers, two 10 inch monitors, amp, a folding table, DJ lights, 4 speaker stands, and my DJ controller gear, plus a cooler in the back and could still see out the back window!  The Fosgate stereo is awesome, the best feature of the car, I love the many surround sound/eq options, and the subwoofer really works!

The reviewers saying it’s sooo slow the cvt sucks and it’s just errrr cheap. See what other suvs you can find for under 20k that are awd and not a complete base model... I went to Toyota Honda Nissan Kia ford Chevy dodge Jeep I spent months looking test driving just wasting time... I had a 2012 Ford and contrary to all the reviews who said it’s nice etc etc. the car completely fell apart it creaked clunked and rattled from every panel there was. Not to mention those funky curvy designs the rest of the manufactures have followed make its impossible to clean your interior. Especially in a dusty condition. Now I’ll be that guy and say these have better interior than a lot of the competion it’s simple elegant interior. Unlike most reviewers I love that about it! I don’t want some funky space ship looking interior that I cant find what button does what. The climate control on these period is how it should be standard on all of them in my opinion. Simple nobs with an auto setting and a knob for temperature.... heated seats are standard! I mean common sorry this 20k vehicle doesn’t quite look like your Mercedes’s bens inside that costed 3x that price tag... Really....who’s buying these to do 0-60 times or push performance. I got mine because I needed an efficient comfortable quiet ride that was both safe and reliable and plus that 34mpg highway over what it’s rated for in the first place is outstanding. Coming from a ford owner you couldn’t pay me to take another one. My family owns ford gm dodge jeeps and I’ve seen the insides of all of them I’ve rode in all of them. For what this is with this price it’s unrivaled hands down. Sure go get your ford cause you wanted a refined everything and all that new stuff they don’t know how reliable it’s going to be because it was released to sell. Mitsubishi doesn’t do that. They take something that was already reliable for years and build upon it trying to improve it. Not build a new car to match all the 0-60 times of new cars and all that. Again who buys one of these to go fast. If you want fast go get a Range Rover supercharged for 4x the price tag. Simple reliable safe and fuel Efficient is what I wanted and it’s comfy the steering is perfectly fine and the cvt though it’s my first cvt vehicle i love it. Smooth constant pull to 55mph at 2000 rpm argue with that!!! It indeed has shift points somewhat it really just seems to hold one rpm when accelerating as much as it can unless you let off and as your letting off it feels exactly like it’s shifting. I love it. 5 transmissions in my ford and countless times of getting boned by the stealership. No more! Take a test drive before you let the expert reviewers change ur mind cause they get payed by the competion. You may well just drive one home.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Josharoo, 02/18/2019,Still a Mitsubishi and that good!,5,"I have owned several Mitsubishi over the years including the horrible rated Mirage which was actually a fun little car to drive. I decided I wanted just a tad more power and room. I got the LE with the 18 inch black rims. This vehicle is a fun ride, has plenty of power, and some perks that are not common for the price. Yes I am aware that it's an ""outdated"" vehicle according to experts but they have constantly refined the Outlander Sports over the years. I remember what they look and felt like when they first came out and they were basic and cheap. The warranty is one of the longest in the market. The reliability has proven itself on its own by being Mitsubishi's best selling vehicle in the US. The best part is Mitsubishi is cheap for maintenance, and for parts. I also like that I can switch to front wheel drive or All wheel drive anytime, this allows me to save even more gas. My two complaints would be that the back seats leg room is a bit tight, and that yes I love my heated seats but I do not have heated side mirrors, come on Mitsubishi!  I got a great sound system, the ride is decent, the seats are comfortable, and I am getting decent MPG. I know I can enjoy this vehicle for 10 years and make my money worth. A new redesign Outlander Sports is coming out 2020, and it looks great, but I got an excellent deal off this one since they need to move the 2018/2019 off the lot. I honestly do not think there going to be much change, more refinement in a new look, with hopefully a more powerful engine to please the mass, even thought I think the 148 HP I have is NOT that bad, especially with the sports mode, and the auto sport manual mode. Tons of techs going on, yet all the professional critics claim they don't. Hmm!

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Kai Pothi, 05/30/2019,Daily Driver (> 70 miles/Day),4,"Bought 2018 sport brand new with 8 miles about a month back and put in about 1000 miles on it. Primary use is for Daily drive (70 miles/day) for me and my wife to go back and forth to work. Don't understand, what the paid reviewers are scaring off the public with there reviews. First learn and understand how the performance varies with CVT transmission and automatic. This car has classic Mitsubishi suspension. Gives me about 29 miles per gallon combined. Has 2.4 ltr engine with CVT transmission. What else do you expect from a 2.4 ltrs 4 cylinder and a CVT transmission, takes a couple more seconds to get to the speed, but once you get to the speed, it goes! Would definitely recommend this for daily drivers! FYI, I grew up driving Lancer's, EVO's and Pajero's lol !

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,MattC, 08/12/2019,Excellent Value ..Drive one and decide,4,"First off this isn't my car but my In-laws. They were looking for an all weather small SUV that would be easy to get into, easy to drive and comfortable. My Mother-In Law would be the primary driver as my Father-In-Law has unfortunately not able to drive any more.  She reached out to me for suggestions on vehicles.  Our family and my wife's family have had primarily Honda products for the last 25 years . However, I had an earlier 2001 Mirage that was a long distance commuter car that I proceeded to put 250k mileage on it in a few years (with zero non scheduled maintenance issues). With That said, The Honda vehicles have been good but we have all had issues with poor Honda driver seats.    I had an earlier Outlander Sport as a rental vehicle and came away impressed with the standard features and comfort. 

My In-laws test drove one and bought one the following week. They love it. 

Pros:

Quiet and comfortable ride. I do not know what the ""professional"" reviewers are talking about. I have taken this vehicle on several long trips with 4 people aboard. The car is quiet and comfortable. One can easily toggle the shifter to (s) to move it out of ECO setting to Sport if needed. Default setting is fine for the majority of driving. Hwy mileage is usually close to 30mpg 

The Interior is well laid out and screwed down . Driver's seat comfort is excellent with ample adjustments . Rear seats are  fine. The infotainment screen is responsive and easy to use. This particular vehicle has a safety suite of backup camera/ lane assist/forward collision alerts. Interior materials are on par with the competition. (again not sure what the professional reviewers are talking about.). Sight lines are stellar.

The warranty is  fantastic . The engine/transmissions have been in service for many years so any bugs have already been worked out. (see new CR-V 1.5L Turbo issues for context. Not slamming Honda but sometimes tried and true designs are fine for most buyers) 

AWD system is excellent with a dedicated ""AWD"" button on the center console to lock the differential of 50/50 split in really bad conditions. 

Finally, Value reigns supreme here. Mitsubishi is fighting with the big boys in this segment for your dollars. They offer a lot of features and a great warranty for less than the competition. There are many excellent vehicles in this segment and I feel the Outlander Sport holds its own .

Cons:

While the Outlander Sport drives well (My review is with the 2.4L/CVT/AWD SEL model). I feel that Toyota's 2.5L is the best standard engine in this class. A little more power or an slightly more aggressive retuning of the CVT would help. 

Rear storage is on the smaller scale compared to the rest of the segment.  

That's it really.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Joshua reedy, 09/21/2018,18 outlander sport le 4x4 2.0 love it!!!,5,"Don’t listen to the “professional” reviewers they don’t have the car but for a day or 2 and drive unreliable bmws as icing on the cake. The interior is awesome I for one don’t like the funky look curvy interior these new cars are getting I got mine for 19k out the door 100k Mitsubishi diamond warranty check that out bumper to bumper for 100k miles. Unbeatable imo. It has ton of space I’m 6”3 and ride very comfortable the awd system is outstanding right up there if not better than Subaru. I’ve had mine for 2000 miles everything from the simple yet classy interior the torquey 2.0 and cvt which I never have had before and used to hate cvts. When you can accelerate from a stop at 2000 rpm all the way to 55 in a smooth constant pull something about it is just nice makes me want to cruise. Gas mileage I’m over what it’s rated for I get about 32mpg Highway. No issue with acceleration onto a busy high way very quiet ride and again it’s very comfortable. For the price warranty and some of the best safety and reliability ratings out there hands down I’m very happy I got out of my ford and into this. I love hearing the reviewers oh look at this cheap plastic yet the same reviewer on my ford said the ford was very nice coming from an owner it rattled like crap door panels popped off when shutting my door. What a joke! They get payed to give a good review and hardly give one otherwise. The owners of these love em and you can’t argue with that. thank you Mitsubishi for getting me out of my unreliable 5 transmission having turd under 150k miles!!! Having peace of mind that you in something reliable is something many don’t know till they end up dumping thousands into a car and regret it.... like I did.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Dan McCabe, 08/21/2019,Better mpg than rating,5,"I purchased a new 2018 Outlander Sport 2.4 SEL(GT) 4WD loaded with collision avoidance, moonroof, Rockford/Fosgate 9 speaker stereo with 10"" subwoofer,  leather, heated seats, power heated and power folding mirrors, power sunshade for moonroof, auto high beams, rain sensing wipers in April 2019. On two recent trips I averaged over 30mpg, and in fact setting my cruise at the posted mph I was actually able to bump it up to 33.7 for the first 1 1/2 hours of the 4 hour drive. The second trip a 12 hour round trip from Saratoga, NY to Rangeley Lake Maine through the mountains of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine,....averaged 30.7mpg!! Great vehicle!!
Ditto on my wife's 2017 Outlander GT loaded!!
I will most probably always be a Mitsubishi owner!
"
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,CEM, 09/25/2019,Why I bought a 2018 Outlander Sport LE,5,"VALUE!  Hands down ! Don't listen to the professional reviewers go drive one yourself! Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy were 3 to 5 thousand dollars more and gets worst when you add the cost of a 2 more years of bumper  
to bumper and a 10 year powertrain warranty on the competition . How much more would that add to there cost. 

Here is my honest review good and bad about the Outlander Sport. Is it the most powerful, No, The 2.0 engine is fine for 90% of drivers, it's smooth and the CVT transmission is tuned perfect to make great use of its power and still return great MPG. In mixed driving I get between 28 and 30. For me it has a good combination of comfort and handling. It's very stable a highway speeds. Good road feel and brakes seem better than others. Wind noise also seemed better than other ones I drove at highway speeds. Front seat comfort was the best, they have a nice wide contour seat with plenty of leg room. Toyota and Honda and Chevy was the worst, hard, low, and very narrow. Reviewers complain about the interior for hard plastics and being very plain. Looking at the competition they have fancier hard plastics in there's. Outlanders interior might look dated and simple to some people but having simple easy controls is not a negative to me. I don't have to keep getting the owner's manual out to operate anything. Cargo room in back falls in the middle of the competition. Back seats fold very easy compared to some. Inside spare tire was a plus, some had no spare. Android Auto was a huge plus for me for smartphone integration, Some didn't offer it which means you have to buy a expensive nav system. Standard Stero was by far the best of any . Standard 18 inch  wheel again without having to buy another trim level to get on others. Fit and finish was as good as any others in this class. 
Now some negatives in my opinion. Road noise is not as good as some, a lot depended on the road surface how much there was. Back seat room is ok, some had more, others less. Wish the back seat had a recline adjustment. Sport mode for the CVT is too aggresive. Lumbar adjustments for the front seat might be useful for some. Very little sound from the backup sensors although backup camera is good. Doors when you close them sound tinny. Radio loads apps slow when you start up the car, like android auto, bluetooth. 2019 mits have new radio's that fixed that issue. Some complain there is no power liftgate option, not sure if that's a big deal for most. 

Don't sell this Outlander Sport short, Its a great value for the money compared to the competition, does better than most in reliability, and fuel economy and crash test.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Pat, 08/22/2019,Very Happy,5,"I agree with others that our writing on here, this is the 2nd Outlander Sport we have owned. We leased a 2015, and we were going to buy it outright but when we got to the dealer, they gave us such a deal that we bought a 2018. I love the ride, the looks, and the 4WD, which you need in Minnesota... It has gotten me through some wet and heavy snows, and for less than $20,000 how can you go wrong when other cars in this class are going for $25,000-$35,000 I would choose the Outlander Sport again...

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Kamran, 06/29/2018,Great crossover unless you are rear-ended,2,"I purchased this vehicle for my wife to get a safer vehicle than her smaller sedan. We were completely happy with it until we were hit from behind on the highway. Our driver and passenger seatback broke and were instantly thrown into the fully reclined position throwing myself and my wife into the backseat of the vehicle. We were lucky that our 2 month old son was placed in the middle of the backseat so we only struck the sides of his carseat as we were thrown backwards. If there was anyone sitting directly behind us, the injuries could have been catastrophic.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Tara, 04/05/2019,Great small SUV for the Money,4,I've been driving the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SEL for over a week now and overall am very happy with it.  I traded in a Mitsubishi Lancer for an SUV and I think the value for the money on both cars is fantastic.  You get some frills and thrills without the price tag.  The reason for 4 stars is because the vehicle is very loud on the highway.  Doesn't bother me too much but i can see how that would bother others.  Also I would love a power lift gate instead of having to always open/close the abck from outside the vehicle.
mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Satisfied OutlanderSport Owner, 03/10/2020,Why the bad press?,4,"I purchased a new 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport after test-driving Jeep's 2018 Cherokee, Compass and Renegade models, and most competitors' smaller SUV models including Toyota's, Nissan's and Ford's Eco-Sport.  Previous 4x4 vehicles I had owned through the years included Ford Explorer Sport, Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Patriot, Jeep Compass and Jeep Wrangler.  Due to lack of advertising and poor reviews I read online, I never would have considered a Mitsubishi Outlander if a nearby Jeep dealership had not acquired a Mitsubishi dealership and delivered some inventory to the location where I was about to purchase an overpriced 2018 Jeep Compass I was not particularly happy with after test-driving.  One road test in the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport proved its optimal value for me and I hesitated no further:  it demonstrated a much quieter and smoother ride than any vehicle among its competitors!  Its far-superior manufacturer's warranty when compared with competitors' offerings for ""extended warranties,"" further eroded the latter's price-competitive positions; and it fairly gleamed with sleeker exterior body styling compared with its off-road rugged-appearing competitors that demonstrated no superiority in off-road capabilities without extensive, high-dollar options packages.  In central New York state, I was not shopping for a sports-car nor an off-road utility vehicle--I was shopping for a reliable, responsive and safe drive in all weather and traffic conditions.  Standard features--back-up camera, body-painted dual rear view mirrors, remote start--further advanced its price-competitive position among alternatives; and its fuel economy with 2.4l inline 4 cylinder engine and 4x4 with lock automatic transmission were at least average among the vehicles I test-drove.  I have been very happy with it.  It has performed extremely well in snow and icy road conditions and driver visibility has been excellent.  My only regret is the Sport's ""incapability"" of towing even a lightest weight teardrop micro camper; so I am considering a trade for a larger Mitsubishi Outlander with towing capabilities.  I anticipate remaining a satisfied Mitsubishi customer through the foreseeable future.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2018,Thian, 06/08/2020,Great Compact and Affordable,5,"I purchase 2018 Mitsubishi GT Premium Octane Blue. I never regret. I used to own 2014 SE model. It was a 2L and a bit lagging in power. The 2018 GT is 2.4L is great perfect for the size. I had read so many negative reviews about Mitsubishi RVR, and sometime wonder myself why. I love the manual control for AWD with differential lock. It is a great compact SUV for a small family. The ground clearance is great too.

I needed a spare second vehicle with ground clearance and AWD. This is a rough ride and cheap fit and finish vehicle. It serves it's purpose but like I said in my title.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2019,Larry, 10/19/2019,Edmunds Opinion what?? we do not agree,5,"Last month we got a 2019 Outlander sport ES. We really like this vehicle. It is very comfortable and the fit and finish are excellent. So far it has been a very reliable vehicle. My opinions are MUCH different than Edmunds.
I have no idea why they give this Mitsubishi a bad/so-so rating. Below is what Edmunds says and then what I say.

1, Ride quality is very rough over bumpy roads<<not my outlander, it is smooth comfortable easy to drive and no blind spots thanks to a lot of windows and large side-view mirrors.

2. Many interior materials look and feel cheap to the touch<< what???  we think things are logically placed in this vehicle. the radio, climate control, and seats are all logically placed and the dash has a nice look and feel to it. It rivals many in its class and is, in my opinion, the dash is better laid out than the Rogue, Equinox and even the Encore. And certainly does NOT look or feel  ""cheap"".3. The transmission is aggravating due to slow responses
Raucous drone while accelerating, especially with 2.0-liter engine<<  not mine, we bought the 5-speed manual because the CVT""S transmissions are known for this common issue and it is not just Mitsubishi that has this issue with the cvt""s.
Mitsubishi stands behind what they built for 5/60 -10/100,000, none of the others accept Kia/Hyundai and VW  offer such a great warranty. We are very happy with this Outlander and paid THOUSANDS less than a similarly equipped Toyota, Ford, Kia, GM  VW and many others in its class. The Outlander Sport, in my opinion, is very underrated.
The only small things we wish this vehicle had is lighted door panels so you can see the window switches at night as well as a light down low by the brake and accelerator pedals. We also would have liked to see the Outlander have lockout protection so IF  you accidentally lock and close the door not using the keyfob, that the driver's door at least would not lock. And lastly, I would like to have the door locks automatically lock when you accelerate. Other than those small issues, The Outlander Sport is a great well-made vehicle I highly recommend taking a look at the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. 
Edmunds has no option when you select ""vehicle details"" to select the ES with the 5-speed manual. We do have the ES with the 5-speed manual.NOT the CVT.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2019,inuvik, 12/12/2019,Awesome Affordable SUV,5,"I own the rarest of the Outlander Sports- a 2019 5 speed manual transmission.  2019 was the last year for the manual transmission and if I was ever going to get one it was now or never.  Hands down the best decision I ever made.  The Outlander Sport with a manual transmission is an absolute joy to drive.  Plenty of power and loves to rev.   I can understand why with the CVT it’s far less satisfying.  The 2.0 Mitsubishi 4B11 is a “square” engine.  The bore and stroke are identical.  This means not much low rpm torque (which CVT’s always try to keep the lowest rpm’s possible).  But with the 5 speed it’s a absolute hoot to drive.  This engine transmission combination is simply the Lancer’s engine and transmission dropped into the Outlander Sport.  Driving it like a sport sedan will bring a smile to your face.  Once you hit 3500 rpm MIVEC kicks in and it just jumps from 3500-5000 rpm in a heart beat.  Since it s FWD only torque steer is a issue which makes it even more fun because it feels raw and at times a handful.  With the traction control off you cannot be reckless with the throttle because it will get out of hand quickly.

I’ve owned it about 6 months now and am approaching 10000 miles of trouble free driving.  My mileage has been excellent averaging over 30mpg with my best tank of almost 36mpg.  Is a manual transmission for everyone?  Of course not, it seems these days that in the race to automate everything all the joy has been removed from driving.  This my friends restored the fun in driving for me.

It is the base model (only version available with the 5 speed).  What do you get with that?
Comfortable cloth seats with good support.  Manual seat height adjustment (driver’s side only) which I prefer to powered seats because less to fail further down the road.  Cruise control, backup camera, AC, tilt & telescoping steering wheel.  The base stereo is a decent unit with Bluetooth which I use to stream from apps on my phone.  Of course being the base model it doesn’t have all the über fancy options but that’s just fine by me.

If you like soulless driving get a CVT anything.  If you actually enjoy driving and want to row your own gears and need/want a compact SUV then the 5 speed Outlander Sport should be on your very short list.  Oh and a final note, what was the cost of admission to fun driving for a brand new 2019 5 speed Outlander Sport?  $15,749.00 out the door.  That’s not a typo.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2019,Frank , 09/10/2019,Best purchase hands down,5,"My 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES FWD is a great car not just because of the price but also for those of us that look for a well balanced SUV. The performance and materials of the suv fits perfectly together for the price... my aunt bought a RAV 4 the same day I got my outlander and she likes the outlander better than her RAV 4. If you take care of your car with no doubt your car will take care of you and that’s ultimately the goal. 

The outlander is quite with barely any engine noise and transmission is smooth and fun. Independent suspension gives it a Mercedes type of comfort when driving on uneven surfaces. The size of the suv is perfect for city parking and driving. Side mirrors are big and gives you more viewing real estate. Power steering is super smooth and brake assist is awesome.  I love my outlander and would purchase it again and also recommending it to family and friends

Nothing fancy very straight forward rental car feeling it’s like something out of 90s with some newer tech added like USB and apple car play....but seriously do we need anything more? 

I checked price tag of this car at local car dealer and I would not pay full price but maybe a year old with less than 15k miles will be a good candidate to shop? That’s my take on this CUV.

I have just over 7000 miles now and I like the suv. But the cargo size is to small.

mitsubishi,outlander-sport,2019,Evan D, 11/16/2020,Don’t trust anyone who says this car is nice,3,"Where to begin? I just returned to Texas from a week-long trip to Seattle, WA, on which, I got a 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES as my rental. I willingly chose it over a Sportage or a Santa Fe, because it’s not a car that you see as often. Well, I can understand why no one buys them. Let me elaborate. 

1) Overall: My rental car was a base model, and so, I’m judging it fairly. Put this against a 2019 base C-HR, HR-V, Kona, EcoSport, etc, and you’ll soon understand why it’s not a segment leader. It gets you where you need to go, and, yeah. That’s about it. There are a few, I guess, “nice” touches that maybe not every base model in this segment comes with. But, they’re hardly major selling points when you evaluate the vehicle as a whole. 

2) Performance: It’s slow. There’s not much else to say. 148hp in the base 2.0 engine doesn’t give you a lot to work with. Pair that with my FWD model in rainy Seattle, and, let’s just say the car doesn’t inspire much confidence on the roads. Off a stop, it’s kinda peppy. However, always make sure you have a firm grip on the steering wheel if you’re going to hit the gas. The tires will spin, and the so will the steering wheel. My rental had almost 60k miles, and I meant to check the tire tread, but never did. So, with new tires that may not be as bad. When merging onto a freeway, or going up a steep hill, don’t be in a rush. Plan your merging ahead of time, and hope that the car gets you to where you hope to join the rest of the traffic. I took it up a very steep and tall hill in the Kenmore/Bothell area multiple times, and let’s just say the car wasn’t enjoying it, nor was I. My foot was on the floor as the car’s underwhelming powertrain screamed at me. The steering is also an oddity. It feels like it’s attached to a very loose rubber band. Keeping the vehicle steady around curves is a bit of a learning experience. 

3) Comfort: The cloth seats provided a lot of cushion, and I never found them uncomfortable. The adjustability of the seat and steering wheel allowed me to find a comfy driving position. Getting into the rear seats for elderly people can be a challenge, as the gap between the lower seat cushion and the B-pillar is fairly narrow. Ride comfort is ok. There is a high amount of road and wind noise when at highway speeds. But, for the class and price, you wouldn’t expect luxury noise levels. 

4) Reliability: I said 4 stars because it never gave me any troubles but I wouldn’t expect much from a Mitsubishi. From what I’ve heard, their reliability isn’t amazing. 

5) Interior: Cheap cheap cheap. That’s all you can say. There is soft touch on the majority of the dash, and the tops of the front doors. And there are some nice knee pads with contrast stitching that help a bit with the visual aspect. No exciting design cues in the cabin. Just functional. If you get a higher trim, the leather may improve the area. 

6) Safety: Hard to rate this category as I luckily never crashed it. However, as far as safety features on the vehicle, there’s not much. You have your standard stuff like airbags and antilock brakes. But no pre-collision, lane keep assist, auto lights, etc. And obviously, in the base model, no fancy features like adaptive cruise or lane-centering, things that may not even be available. But, it kept me alive, so thank you Mitsubishi. 

7) Technology: If I wrote out everything that it didn’t have, this review would be four pages long. So, here’s what it has, in the base model: automatic single-zone climate control, a 7ish” touchscreen without phone integration, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, buttons on the steering wheel for the infotainment, a 4ish” driver MID between the analog gauges, keyless entry (no push-button start), a backup camera (federally mandated so, obvi), variable intermittent windshield wipers, and a one-touch up-down driver window. That’s pretty much it.
 Not surprising, you get what you pay for. 

8) Value: Meh. It’s cheap and it shows. It’s slow and bland. If you want a nicer car, there are many. If money is super tight and you want a new car, and need a crossover, then it’ll get you where you need to go, probably.

mitsubishi,diamante,2000,Peggy, 01/10/2010,great car,5,"I bought this car new and have only had reliability. I have only done routine maintenance. Never broken down or replaced parts other than brakes, tires, and muffler. I have over 155,000 miles. It still rides it did new. Great riding comfort and pickup. I get about 27 miles highway and 24 around town. If they were still made I would buy another!"
mitsubishi,diamante,2000,MarkPenner, 09/26/2006,Happy with my Diamante,5,"I purchased my 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante in Dec. 2003. I did a lot of online research before purchasing and found that most of the people complain about its fast depreciation, but praise reliability of the car. I was looking for a good used car, so fast depreciation was a good news.  Why pay $36,000 for a new, when you can get a great used car for $12,000? So, I found a Diamante with 55,000 miles online and drove it home. For two years that I owned this car I just did regular maitainance (oil, transmission fluid, brakes, put new set of tires). I had no problem with transmission, it shifts perfectly. I didn't have any problems with the heat-core either. I spent only $480 in maintainance to keep this car in excellent shape for two years."
mitsubishi,diamante,2000,NoMaaM, 12/10/2004,Nightmare,1,"I have had nothing but problems with my 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante.  The last one is the famous heater core leakage problem.  Just google for ""Diamante heatercore"" and you will see It is a known problem and Mitsubishi knows about it but is not doing anything. This problem costs $700 - $900 to repair or you will be poisoned inhaling antifreeze.  Also, the 60,000 mile service costs $1,500 for a car not worth even $9,000.  I will never purchase a Mitsuibishi again."
mitsubishi,diamante,2000,WtbyCT, 06/02/2008,"Sharp looking, great performance",4,"I got my 2000 LS in 2003 to replace the 1993 Grand Am that my parents gave me as a first car.  For the first two years that I owned it I drove the socks off the thing but it easily took the abuse of a 17 year old guy and his friends. Once I got into college I took more interest in the car since I knew I needed a car that would last me into the beginning of my career.  With a nice wash and wax, this car gets me compliments everywhere I go.  Take care of this car and it will take care of you.  On the highway I find the acceleration to be amazing between 60-80 and I can hang with most Euro cars and blow the socks off the other JP cars. Only prob is at 60,000 mi it's going to be $1100+ service"
mitsubishi,diamante,2000,Eugene, 06/16/2008,Great Car for the money,3,Love the car but hate to see it losing value.  OEM parts are ridiculously expensive and aftermarkets are hard to come by.  Gas mileage is not all that great (20- 22 MPG) and heater core problem is starting to surface.  I would recommend this car if you can find an exceptional deal .
mitsubishi,diamante,2000,Lon611, 05/03/2008,Almost Perfection,4,"An amazing car, all around. I actually bought this because i loved my '93 diamante so much. interior quality + performance is top notch. only problem is that it can be slightly non-responsive from a stop (not a big deal). Exterior is sleek;the first time i saw it i was reminded of a BMW. B+/A- in my book. wish they still made these. "

noise however.  I went to trade this for
another Mitsubishi.  No deal with
financing work that much loss of value
$26,000 car new and was only offered
$9,000 in trade.  No resale value,
dealer was rude. (Not the original

than being noisy, the car is a running
dude.  My transmission works well, don't

mine is not a problem."

50,000 miles and it's worth nothing

mitsubishi,diamante,2000,mitmit, 01/05/2005,Hasn't Let Me Down Yet,4,"My 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante has been extremely reliable and fun to drive.  I've always liked the styling of the Diamantes, and you get a really nice car for a reasonable price.  The only disadvantages I've observed are their poor resale value, and some components could be of higher quality.  For example, I was told at 38,000 miles that my struts were going to need to be replaced soon.  (However, I haven't replaced them, and it still rides fine.)  The other quality issues were more cosmetic in nature, like a trim piece that peeled."
mitsubishi,diamante,2000,farazrehman, 01/27/2005,Great looking / performing car for the price,4,"I purchased my 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante last August for two main reasons, its price and features. I couldn't find a similarly equipped toyota Camry or Honda Accord for my $9,500 budget. A few months later, the heater core O-ring failed and coolant started leaking into the vent system. The fix was costly, about $1,100 but the car has been running without a problem since. The Diamante has lots of power under the hood, the acceleration is good but the transmission gets confused sometimes i.e. downshift may not happen immediately when you need a quick boast.  The interior is quiet and its ride quality is somewhere between good and excellent. The Diamante is clearly more biased towards comfort and doesn't handle as well as my previous Mazda Millenia "

has been excessive road noise.  We've

and I've really enjoyed driving it.  It 
has good power and looks really nice.  
However, some components aren't durable 
enough - at 42,000 miles the struts are 
already going bad.  Occasionally, it 
doesn't shift as nicely as I'd like.  
Plus, the rear window trim is peeling 
off, which looks bad.  The resale value 
goes down quickly after you buy it new, 
so buy this if you want to keep it for 
awhile.  But once you drive it, I bet 
you'll want to keep it for awhile.  "

mitsubishi,diamante,2001,christmas_tree, 03/11/2009,"Good car for money, BUT...",3,"Really liked the car when I purchased it with only 24,000 miles in 2004.  By the time it had 40k miles it had the very common heater core leak... by the time it had 50k miles rear/driver side abs speed sensor failed so abs brakes are non-functional since then, neither is the traction control... both ABS and TCL light stay on all the time now.  By 55k egr solenoid failed, not too costly to replace if you do it yourself.  By 60k miles the rear springs are worn out, with 3 passengers in the rear the rear bottoms out, replaced shocks which didn't help at all.  By 80k antenna motor failed.  Bottom line, even though I like the car I wouldn't buy a Mitsubishi again, with the other options."
mitsubishi,diamante,2001,Mike, 01/20/2010,Expensive to fix,3,"When I first purchased this car it ran great. Currently have about 90,000 miles on it and I am about done throwing money into this thing. I have some of the same complaints as others; wind noise, not a very smooth ride, and most of all expensive to fix repairs.  Inside door handle broke, I can only get from the factory they want over $200 for a piece of plastic. Back end has begun to sway. I have had over $600 put into it plus new tires and problem still isn't fixed. Probably going to need new shocks soon, most likely will get rid of it by then. "

own and drive. I believe that this 
model offers premium features at a very 
reasonable price.
The transmission is flawless, the 
design eye - catching and the engine is 
powerful and quiet.
The 1.9% financing was a bonus.

The interior is very well trimmed with 
much attention to detail. The sound

have owned. My first one a 1992 ran 
like a champ. After 120,000 miles all I 
need to replace was tires, brakes and 
battery. I sold it in 1999 and recently 
found the buyer still had it and it has 
160,000 miles and stil runs like a 
champ. He told me it was the best used 
car he'd ever bought.

My 2001 Diamante LS is all that I 
expected. A smooth ride, plenty of 
horsepower and smooth ride. I have 
friends with BMW's that kick themselves 
for not buying a Diamamte. They said 
the ride is as nice as the BMW's and I 
paid $10,000 less."

love is it has more HP than most of the 
muscle cars and 2 door sport cars you 
see on the road.  Main thing it could 
have is RWD or 4WD.  The front wheels 
spin to easy and when you are trying to 
get the car to go in the rain, here in 
the desert, it can be a problem.  The 
looks a great.  Gas milage is fine for 
what the cars compression is.  You 
can't ask for high gas milage when you 
have a car like this.  The only problem 
you will have is if you try to use 
Regular Unleaded instead of Premium."

not prove this to be true.  The car is 
about a eight on a scale of one to

I test drove a variety of vehicles at the time within my price range and options requirements.  Nothing else came close to the value of this car.  Pblms at 100k miles: 1.  One door speaker needs to be replaced 2.  Antenna no longer retracts. 3.  Roof Liner in back has started to droop  Minor issues, but lead to a problem; replacement parts are hard to come by due to the rarity of the car.  Mechanically its been a rock.  Zero Dollars past scheduled maintenance so far.  I am still in love with this car 4 years later.  "
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,jrbruner, 08/07/2012,Excellent Value,4,"I love this car.
I read all the reviews before I bought this car, and the power train was highly rated.
This car is quiet, comfortable, powerful and reliable.
I have the LS with the heated, 8-way power seats w/power lumbar and love it.
This car was virtually unchanged from 98 until last year, 2004.
The engine is smooth, and responsive and I get much better mileage than edmunds says.
I measured 30 mpg highway in SoCal.
Transmission failed at 75k (apparently common).
Had it fixed by the pros at SoCal Transmission in San Diego and not a lick of trouble since.
Heater core is recurrent problem w/these cars.
These sell for much less than comp. Acura CL or 3.2 TL."
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,Tribefire, 10/04/2009,Diamante,4,"The Mitsubishi Diamante Vr-X is a fun fast ride but since I purchased it I have had to put a lot of money into it... the heater core went around 75k, and it's conveniently place on the firewall so the job itself is a nightmare, I haven't met a Diamante driver past 80k who didn't have to do the same, now I'm having trouble with the 02 sensors, I replaced 3 last year and this year the fourth went.  I'd say the car would be worth it if it didn't cost so much to maintain.  About 1500$ for the heater core repair and about the same for the o2 sensor work."
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,john, 05/08/2008,i love it,4,"First I felt love by the look, but soon I've realized its performance. I wish we could buy this car in Europe. One of the best looking car I have ever seen. More luxurious than the price tag would tell you."

mitsubishi,diamante,2002,7Mick, 07/29/2008,Looks Great!,4,Overall I love this car. Like many others though. I too had the transmission problems. Even after the fix. Still not right! The car is so great to look at. Kind of a Beemer front and a Volvo back. But very unique. Drives like a much bigger car with its smooth ride. I am a chauffeur and when I get out of my town car I don't mind jumping into this car!
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,Frank S. , 10/08/2008,Vroom with a VRX,4,"This car has been a dream.  Lots of power when you need it and a nice sporty feel and sound. Speaking of sound the audio/radio is a great system. There has been no mechanical issues other than oil, brakes and tires. The tires on mine have only about 2,000 miles on them and they are top quality. I had automatic start installed which is nice in bad weather.    We no longer need another vehicle so I'm parting with it. "

Eclipse Convertible and was bowled over 
by the VR-X...all the comfort and quiet 
of the LS with a little more hp, sport 
suspension and exhaust.  I've never 
been this comfortable or had this much 
fun in a car.  While there is a 300M or 
Acura on every corner, you won't see

They made a really great car with lots 
of bang for the buck.  My wifes boss 
is upset. He bought a Lexus. 
We test drove it at 5 dealers and pick 
ours up tonight.  Love the VR-X 
package.  
Everyone looks twice and says what is 
that?  Then they get in and say wow. 
Its the secret luxury car, for less

driving. I love the car and it looks 
better than any Acura/Lexus/Infinity. 
After all the Acura TL is just a Honda 
Accord, the Infinity I30 is just a 
Nissan Maxima and the Lexus ES300 is 
nothing more than a Toyota Camry. Why 
pay big money for a slightly fancier 
version of their run of the mill 
vehicles.  The styling and the smooth 
ride of the Diamante, plus the fact 
that everybody and his brother doesn't 
own one, made the decision to buy easy 
for me.         "
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,justin, 11/05/2006,Watch Out for the Heater Core!,4,I LOVE this car.  It has great style and great reliability - except for the infamous heater core that Mitsubishi refuses to recall. Make sure there is no syrup smell to the Diamante you are looking to purchase.
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,bconboy, 12/28/2011,Started out ok,3,"In its early years this car was a good car, some maintenance as expected I guess (but pretty pricy for this imported car).
But as others have said, once things started going, they went fast.
Had to replace alternator, muffler, tires (worn on inside) and I don't know what else in a pretty short amount of time, and now it sometimes won't even start.

I've asked around and no one knows why, we replaced the magnet at the end of the crankshaft, because it had actually blinked out and died on me while driving, but seemed to be only a temporary solution."
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,never again, 01/11/2010,Big Mistake,2,"Worst mistake I made, uncomfortable ride, too much road noise, just generally unhappy with the car.  Didn't want to be upside down on a trade, so I kept it. Lots of little annoying problems, that I was not used to dealing with in other cars purchase. Due to road noise would rent a car if going over 100 miles.   Just bought 2010 Acura. I'll never go back."

Acura  and Lexus in it's class, it's 
roomy and confortable inside. Handling 
is a good cross between a sports and 
sedan, although the steering could be 
a tad tighter.  Wind noise is minimal, 
though engine could be quieter while 
idling.   Sound system is fantastic, 
with 8 speakers and ample power, but 
design on cd player is plain and lacks 
pause and mute functions. Trunk is 
huge and pass through at rear seat is 
handy. All weather package is great 
with traction control, fog lamps and 
heated seats/side mirrors.  For an 
approx price of $31,000 which included 
taxes and 5 year zero percent 
financing, this car was a bargain."

did not realize how wonderful of a car 
it was until I have gone through a 96 
Jag XJ6 and 98 Cadillac Seville.  
Ultimately, it was the best car I have 
ever owned.  Therefore, I am back at 
the helm of 2002.  For the money, you 
can't beat the equipment.  The style, 
handling and standard features match 
those of much more expensive cars.  In 
the state of the economy, I am 
definately for getting the most for my 
money.  I would recommend a test drive."

mitsubishi,diamante,2002,RStudley, 09/25/2002,I'd rather drive this than a Camry...,4,"Bought an '02 Diamante ES new for a 
couple reasons...  I owned a '97 
Diamante - a good comfortable ride.  I 
also like that I don't see myself 
coming and going - it's sort of a poor 
man's exclusive ride.  I like the 
power, but fun-to-drive quotient is not 
high - it wanders like a puppy, and has 
a bit too much body lean.  Even so, it 
is competent and well behaved (at least 
in normal driving).

The real reason I bought it was price, 
and unbeatable financing.  It also came 
with a 100K mile warranty, and auto 
alarm... 

Summary - not bad if your thing is to 
get ""there"" in relative comfort and 
style."

handles like it's on rails. I give it 
the highest score for it's uniqueness - 
cache, if you will. How many VR-Xs do 
you see on the street? About 1 for

looks - I've even been approached at a

doesn't have the horsepower of the top 
Maxima or Accord but the spunky torque 
takes you from nothing to something 
quickly enough. If you're undecided, 
here's a test - count the number of 
Camrys, Maximas, Accords, and Altimas 
you see in a day. Then count how many 
Diamante VR-Xs you see. That's the 
cachet you can't put a price on."

Rather good for a 3.5 V6 engine, in such a large car. The car rides very smooth, absorbing the bumbs in the road well. Handling is on par, and the car is very comfortable overall. Sure you can get an Acura, or Lexus for around the same price, but the cool thing about the Diamante is that you don't see them on every corner. I like having a car that is fairly rare."

proving to be a great alternative 
limousine to the generic Lincoln. Not 
only is it a great drive but,as my 
customers keep telling me, it is a 
great ride. I bought the ES and had the 
dealer installed leather option. Fit is 
great but one of the door trims is not 
up to scratch. However it has been a no 
quibble replacement. 100% reliable and 
drives exactly the same whether empty 
or fully loaded which suggests that it 
was engineered with integrity. Every 
day a passenger leaves my Diamante with 
the intention of putting it on their 
new car shopping list. I wish I was on 
commission!"
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,Sicilian, 08/25/2003,Could be a great car!,4,"The Diamante is a good car and could be 
a great car. A lot of noises from the 
rear suspension, old fashioned door 
design (no door frame) makes wind 
noise, low seating position, and most 
of all TERRIBLE RESALE VALUE!! This was 
a $28,000 plus car, barely worth half 
of the MSRP. Compare resale value to 
that of a Toyota Avalon or Nissan 
Maxima. Don't buy this car unless you 
want to keep it until the whels fall 
off. Mitubishi needs to either fix this

I have not had one single problem (other than brake job). Only pure enjoyment of this luxury/sport sedan. Everything that made me want this car to begin with still has me smiling today. My previous car was a Lexus LS 400 and I sold it due to high mileage and scary repair probablities. I had to find something that compared to its ride quality and luxury and performance for a reasonable price and this Mitsubishi fits the bill perfectly!

mitsubishi,diamante,2002,Diamante Driver, 11/08/2005,An Honest Review of the Diamante,4,"I bought my 2002 Mitsubishi Diamante new in 8/02, just over 3 years ago. It has very quick pickup and the heated leather seats are nice when it's freezing.  The traction control is great.  The car responds quickly. Its gas mileage isn't wonderful, but it's OK. The trunk is very spacious, but I would like to see a trunk cargo net as standard equipment. The only repairs that I have needed to make have been a lousy battery, and engine light stayed on unnecessarily, also some minor repairs.  The warranty is lousy! It should be 50,000 or 5 years.  I only have 34,000 miles on my car and the warranty is gone! Overall this is a very nice luxurious car but, it is priced too high."

mitsubishi,diamante,2002,atcdav, 03/10/2006,Just OK but the transmission stinks,3,"The styling is not bad. It has a descent amount of amenities for the price. The big seller for me was the 6 year 0% interest financing. That equals an unbeatable value. It has a roomy passenger compartment and plenty of leg room in the back seat. The memory seat function is flawed. It erases itself regularly. Alao, it has no home link for garage remote. The heated mirrors are poor. The worst feature must be the transmission. I have had in in the shop several times for the transmission. It has shift ""flairs"". It feels like it slips. I have had the clutches replaced, the valve body and ports replaced but the problem persists. Not 100% of the time but maybe 40-50%.

The LS series is extremely comfortable, three people easily fit in the back, and I receive nothing but compliments on the car. Standard, the car comes with eight premium speakers, which deliver great sound.  The body looks stylish and the front has a downward curve that makes the car unique.  In the winter on a cold start, the car would make an awful clicking noise that could be heard 1/2 a block away.  I hear this also happens to the same year Galants. The noise does die out once it gets heated up. Even after new breaks and pads I couldn't help to hear an awful clutch when breaking normally.  This didn't happen all the time."
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,Mary, 03/12/2007,Jury's Still Out,3,"I thought I would love this car, but so far I have put mucho bucks back in it already. The heater core died first - thank goodness we got the extended warranty. Then one of the auto window stops broke the first time I used it. Our Chevy full size truck and old Explorer got better gas mileage. I thought  we would be doing better in that area. The ride is very comfortable, but the wind noise is pretty bad. The sun visors are worthless for short people. I love the trunk size. The defrost is wayyy too slow. The stereo is nice, and cruise works great. There are a lot of cup holders, but they don't hold large sized drinks. If I had it to do again, I think I would keep looking. You win some, you lose some."
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,Dustin R, 04/25/2003,A Great Car often Overlooked,4,"This is a great car for the price.  Its 
roomy, has good performance, and looks 
good.  I have over 5K miles and no 
problems.  Lots of standard features 
leather, 10 way power driver 8 way 
power passenger seats, a great traction 
control system, and good brakes (a must 
have)."
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,p cola, 10/25/2007,Old but new,4,"I purchased my Diamante a little over a month ago w/ 94000 miles on it and it runs great so far. When I first set my eyes on it I had to have it. Even though it may be old to someone else it's new to me and I am glad I chose it over any newer car. I get tons of compliments seeing as though there aren't a million Diamantes in the area and I like that. I was very impressed with the stereo system. I love to play loud music, unfortunately I bust them. I love my car and I wish there was an 2007. I don't want anything else but a Diamante. Even my ex-husband gives my compliments. Gas mileage is not the greatest, but who cares. My car looks good and I look good in it."
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,RobbieHe, 05/06/2003,VR-X Great Car!,4,"I purchased this car in November after 
first test driving it back in August.  
I had two Gallants previously, a 1996 
and a 1999, both four cylinder 
versions.  I saw the VR-X off at a 
distance back in August and knew that I 
wanted to take a closer look.  It's a 
great looking car!  When I first test 
drove it, I realized that it was simply 
on a different plane when compared to 
the Gallants.  It's fast, tight, and 
super cool-looking on the inside."

mitsubishi,diamante,2002,Old 27 Lancer, 01/19/2003,Love The Diamante LS,4,"I've driven the Diamante LS over 33,000 
miles in 10 months.  The only negative 
feature has been the junk Goodyear GA 
tires now through the second set. 
Cruise at 80-90 with no problems.  
Speeds over 110 are dangerous with air 
lift under the car's fully enclosed 
chasis plate creating a wobble.  
Comfort is good; panic stopping has 
been a life saver. I'd buy another 
one.  The plan is to accumulate 200,000 
miles on this car for business; I think 
it can do it with no problem.  "
mitsubishi,diamante,2002,GLAB, 05/29/2003,Love this Car !!,5,"This is a quiet, smooth driving, Zippy 
car.  The high torque engine is 
fantastic.  Transmission shifts very 
smoothly downshifting when you need it

the automatic climate control is great !
The stereo sounds fantastic and gets 
rave reviews by every passenger that

I've had the car to the dealer several times to correct the problems only to be told it was ""tire noise"". I even went out of town and drove the same car. Same problems. I think there is design problems with the car. I have asked that the problems be corrected or give me another car."

Has plenty of go, we now average 27 mph hwy on regular gas and Valvoline hi-mileage synthetic oil.  Never a problem, looks and positive comments from others.  Very comfy on a + 6hr ride in front and back.  Leather is sweet and sound system is great.  Best buy for the money."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Scott B, 02/03/2003,Great Car,4,"After looking at serveral cars 
including the Nissan Maxima and 
Chrysler 300m i finally bought the 
Mitsubishi Diamante. The Nissan and the 
Chrysler handled well and were nicely 
styled but the ride in each was too 
harsh. The diamante did not handle 
quite as good but it seemed to stike a 
better balance between performanc and 
ride than either of the other two cars. 
The stereo was better and the car 
seemed to have a more simple yet classy 
interior. Overall i love this car and 
clould not be happier about my choice."

I maintain mine and do oil changes religiously so it is still in great shape with 65,000 miles on it. It hasn't spent one day in the garage. I love the appearance, all the options, and the size. I can have my son's car seat in the middle and still have room for adult passengers on both sides of him. I have more room for people and stuff than small SUVs. The trunk space is very generous. All the luxury items without the over-inflated price tag!"

mitsubishi,diamante,2003,kat, 04/17/2005,2003 Diamante vs. 1998 Diamante,3,"This is my second Diamante. Also own a 1998. When comparing the 2003 to 1998, Mitsubishi has cheapened up on the interior. Lower quality leather & poorer sounding stereo. Problems with highway driving when tractor trailers are in front of me. The front end tends to shift back and forth as if there are aerodynamics & traction control issues. Electrical system does crazy things. For example, doors lock by themselves. I say, stick with the older models. They are more comfortable and give a better ride. More like what you would expect for a $30,000 car."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,m bloom, 10/12/2003,Best For Value,4,"The looks of this car first got my attention. 
After a test drive I was hooked. You can't 
touch the performance or amenities in 
another car unless you want to shell out 
another 10 g's. This car truly is Americas 
best kept automotive secret. I just hope it 
stays that way so prices will stay as 
reasonable as they are."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,William Dunn, 01/10/2004,GREAT CAR,4,"The heated leather seats, heated 
mirrors, 7 CD in dash player and the 
Platinum white color made the car a 
must have.  After looking at and 
driving Infinity I35, Acura TL, Honda 
Accord, Lincoln LS and others the 
combination of luxury, color, 
driveability and the cash back made the 
decision for my wife and me.  The best 
car we ever owned was a 1991 Mitsubishi 
Mirage that finally had problems at 
more than 208,000 miles.  If this 
mitsubishi Diamanti LS is half the car 
of previous 1991 Mitsubishi, we will be 
very happy.  "
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,VM, 08/04/2003,Second chance seems good,4,"I was satisfied with my 2001 Diamante 
LS, but VRX version's tighter 
suspension and handling make this ride 
more enjoyable.  Interior hasn't 
changed much, but platinum trim is 
sharp (except steering wheel is a 
little cheesy). Getting one without the 
rear spoiler reduces cheese-factor, 
also. "

I've only had to change the oil.  My only complaint is that it could have more leg room for tall drivers (I am 6 ft 3 in.).
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Dennis Castor, 06/09/2005,Love this car,4,I love the way this car handles and the power it has when needed. It still looks better than most cars on the road today.

I have kids and the interior, with a little vacuuming, looks as good as the day I bought it.  The ride is Cadillac like, smooth and plush.  My only complaint is the depreciation of the vehicle.  I lost half the MSRP the first year.  It has stayed steady since then though, at least according to www.Edmunds.com."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,MikeD, 12/14/2005,"Cool Design, Poor Build",3,"The 2003 Mitsubishi Diamante looks great - it definitely gets praise for its ""coolness factor.: However, the build quality is terrible. Ive previously owned Toyotas so maybe Im used cars being tight and relatively maintenance free. This car has had constant rattles in the interior, the console is made of all cheap plastic materials, at 13,000 miles the front rotors were warped (not covered under warranty), I have three rust spots on the hood (not covered under warranty), there is squeak when turning sharply (dealer cant find), in cold weather the door takes about ten slams to get it to close correctly, and the glove box has somehow sagged,  This car is now worth less than half than what I paid (no seriously, in less than two years it depreciated by $16,000)."

mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Don, 02/21/2005,One of the best cars I've owned,4,"The 2003 Mitsubishi Diamante has unexpected, powerful, and quick acceleration.  It has smooth and very comfortable road performance after I changed to better touring tires.  You need to use only the best windsheild wiper blades otherwise they are noisy.  The specs require plus fuel, but I alternate with regular without any noticeable mileage or performance difference.  The fuel indicator shows close to empty when there is still more than a hundred miles left in the 19 gallon tank.  I average 22 mpg in the city.   It has a good stereo with controls on the steering wheel.  I don't understand why professional car reviewers do not rate this car higher.       "
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,R.L.Green, 03/07/2005,2003 Mitsubishi Diamante VR-X,5,"My 2003 Mitsubishi Diamante VR-X has been outstanding in every category. I immediately put on aftermarket wheels and tires.  Along with the optional VR-X package, I have one of the best looking and running cars on the road. The Infinity stereo system is awesome with an amp. There are several ways to improve the engine performance in this car. Just do a little homework.  It is really a shame that Mitsubishi discontinued the Diamante. What does that say about them when they discontinue their flagship model in search of something geared toward the younger buyer. I am a proud owner and will keep my Diamante for a very long time.  I plan to enter it in some car shows since it will be in a class by itself. It is a 10 out of 10 in my book."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Scott, 03/16/2005,Something Different,4,"There are too many Toyota Camrys, Honda Accords, and Nissan Altimas out there. I wanted something different. Is the 2003 Mitsubishi Diamante cutting edge? No, but it is a solid vehicle that has no weaknesses and it provides a lot of bang for the buck (if you buy used and avoid the depreciation hit.) I have had a lot of success with Mitsubishi products in the past. I am very happy so far with my Diamante ES. The car looks good to me and its engine, drivetrain and handling are very smooth and predictable. I have not experienced any mechanical problems so far after 15,000 miles. The car has an adaptive transmission feature where if you hop on the gas, it downshifts quickly and holds the shift point to a higher rpm. However, if you're gentle on the throttle, it shifts at a lower rpms. This is a great car if you can find one, they didn't make many."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Carolyn, 07/28/2005,Best kept Secret,4,"I just recently bought my Diamante, actually it is my first luxury car. I found the Diamante to be afforable for what it offers. The gas mileage is a little less than what I had expected and the steering can be improved. In the aspect of accerlation I was pleasantly surprised. I find the car fun to drive but am always asked ""Who makes the Daimante?"" I do have to admit that I am pleased that the road is not over crowded with them, so they do stand put more and I often catch people galncing over and checking out the car. "

mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Ray, 08/10/2006,"Diamante is ""Okay""",3,"The stiff ride improved significantly with the addition of Goodyear Assurance tires.  Overall the Diamante is a pretty good value for the money.  It is reliable but had little glitches initially and I spend several days at the dealer having noises fixed and things adjusted.  I am currently having trouble finding patch paint and misc. parts.  I would like more power but it's adequate as is.  A recent trip East gave me a low of 22 and high of 29 mpg -  overall 26.54 mpg at 70+ mph all the way - I'm pleased.  I will probably keep this one for a while as my ""work"" transportation.  Too bad they stopped importing the car."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Deborah, 07/16/2007,Beautiful Car,4,We bought the car new in 03.  Overall this car is so beautiful and rivals BMW and Lexus in my opinion.  It's designed beautifully both inside and out and is unique from other luxury sedans.   We have had some quality issues however.  The brake light in the rear windshield constantly falls and we've taken it to the dealer 5 times.  They still haven't fixed it.  We have to keep it propped up.  Plastics are very cheap looking. The black rubber molding in the passenger side door has had to be replaced in the front seat and the back seat is now having issues too.  Also issues with paint chipping and wind noise.  Glove box doesn't latch properly and hangs open a bit even when closed.

mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Nikki, 04/30/2008,nice car but could of did better,3,Well I bought my Diamante used.. I loved this car when I test drove it. Beware! This car carries a high symbol for insurance rates. This car is 5 years old and has a higher symbol than most brand new cars. Not worth it to insure it . Get insurance quote before u buy. Other than the high insurance and the 19 mpg on highway (which sucks with the price gas today) ---- I'm trading it in. For cheaper insurance and better gas mileage . On the other hand the car has a nice style about it. It runs smooth.  Oh and not very good in snow or slush. Parts and labor are more expensive
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,HIGH ROLLer, 01/02/2006,Worst Car Ever,2,"The 2003 Mitsubishi Diamante was the worst car ever.  I bought it to see what everyone was talking about and I have no idea what they were thinking. This car is pathetic. I returned it as soon as possible. I suggest the 2006 BMW 7-Series; that is the car I got once I returned that piece of trash. It has horrible handling, terrible interior comfort, and the outside is hideous.  If I were one of these owners I would pay Mitsubishi to take it off my hands. "
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,Josie, 09/03/2008,My V-RX Rocks,4,"I have 137K on mine and all I've had to replace is brakes and tires. (Bridgestone Insignia s-200's are a great replacement for the Goodyears it came with improves ride greatly)Plenty of power and if you use synthetic oil you can get 22mpg in town and better on the hwy. Since switching to synthetic oil it gets 22mpg consistently in town weather I lead foot it or drive like Grandma. This is the perfect blend between sports car and luxury car. Luxury usually sacrifices a bit of style and pep which this has both, and sports cars usually sacrifice smooth ride which this has too.This is the closest thing you can get to a BMW or a Mercedes for 30 grand. Camry and Accord feel cheap by comparison."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,BRANDEN, 06/17/2009,Diamante LS,4,"This car has been a blessing for me!  Cold A/C and very comfortable to sit in!  Just have a few complaints.  Fuel economy is terrible, especially in the city, and showing signs of rust and paint is starting to peel on the hood!  All and all this car's performance is awesome.  Transmission doesn't seem to shift at the right time especially when you punch it right off the line!  Using Full Synthetic Motor Oil has increased horsepower greatly and be sure to run only premium fuel in these cars to help get the most out of your gas tank!"

a big guy like me, very spacious.  It's
not as fast as I'd like it to be but the
looks cover that.  The car looks great.
 I like the light-up dash speedometer
thing.  Back passenger windows go down
all the way.  I also like the mirrors
attached to doors, something different
from other cars.  Another thing I like
about this car is it does have window
frames, it may be a bad thing after a
while but I love it.  Thing I dont like
about it, it's kinda slow at 200hp and
back seat doesnt go down.  Overall, this
is a great car."
mitsubishi,diamante,2003,bozo, 02/27/2003,Best Kept Secret,4,"I had not intended to purchase a 
Diamante until offered one from the

having all the bells and whistles of 
much more expensive models like the 5 
series BMW or the Lexus 300 series. It 
also has a great ride, handling,  
and ""kick""."

mitsubishi,diamante,2004,jivko atanassov, 11/22/2009,One of the top cars for me,5,"I didn't want to buy the Diamante initially because of size or fuel scares.  The Diamante has surpassed all my expectations, the car is luxurious, lots of standard extras  sometimes I need some engine power to get out of difficult road situations. This car has all the power needed and then some. The traction control has saved me a couple of times also. ABS is also there. The gets 20.5 mpg average. And this is a luxury full size sedan with 3.5 liter engine.  I got it with all extras for less money than the added cost for the same extras alone in another brand. Go figure. Nice product, poor marketing. For a family of four it is a perfect car  And if I have to chose again now? Yes!!!"
mitsubishi,diamante,2004,Not Bad, 06/26/2009,Not Bad,4,"A very nice vehicle, especially when figuring in the value.  Priced well below its competitors.  LS loaded with features.  Great engine.  Interior ergonomics are comical.  Surprisingly little thought put into switchology.  Can't see speedo behind wheel. I just can't get comfortable in this car, as nice as it appears.  Poor city  mileage.  Troublesome brakes.  Have redone front brakes twice in 20,000 miles.  Mitsubishi is famous for warping the rotors.  Much preferred the previous grille to the current one. "
mitsubishi,diamante,2004,TexasJoe, 07/21/2008,Great Car,4,"After owning several cars over my lifetime I can say this is definitely the best so far. The car is very reliable, inexpensive to own, gets great mileage (20-24 city and 32-38 highway depending on my lead foot). The engine has a lot of power if you need it to. Taking turns sharp will automatically throttle the engine to keep you from losing control (did I mention my lead foot?).  Interior comfort has really spoiled me on other cars. I have recently car shopped with a friend and wasn't happy with the interiors of newer cars in comparison. My only complaint is the leather is Black. In Texas, that makes for hot summers but the comfort makes up for it."
mitsubishi,diamante,2004,Satisfied, 02/09/2008,Satisfied,4,"Three-time Mitsubishi product owner (Eclipse '91, Expo '94 and Diamante) - all exceptional value for the expectation. Ran the first two into the ground. Bought this used with 16,000 miles,  and I have no reason to suspect that this model will not make the grade. Interior has a couple of flaws - seams splitting on back bench and carpet pullaways, and sound system seems to have been challenged by someone's bass setting, but it runs great and keeps up on the highway."

shop 9 times for repairs in six months. 
Once for lights, four times for brakes 
and three times to adjust the window on 
the drives side. (Door would not shut)
Three times to repair the lumbar in 
drivers side seat. Other than 
constantly having to return to the 
dealership(which is 30 miles away) for 
what they call minor repairs and 
adjustments, I love this car. Very 
powerful and an incredible drive."
mitsubishi,diamante,2004,captkirkstny, 12/19/2006,Diamante VR-X Rocks!,5,Purchased August 2004. this is my second Diamante and third Mitsubishi. My dealer is 100 miles away.  I only return there because of the free scheduled maintenance.  Otherwise this car has been trouble free.  That's how reliable these cars are. I did have to replace the driver window switch which is under warranty.
mitsubishi,diamante,2004,Grant stockdale, 04/29/2008,A great all round car,4,"This is my Third Diamante just love them I've had this one lowered 50 mm [2 inches] the standard rims replaced with 18 inch mags and low profile tires. WOW she looks so smart makes her just that little bit different than other Diamantes The car is a wee bit heavy on gas around town but I get great highway miles in absolute comfort good dash features and a good quality CD player stereo etc the one fault would be a little too much road noise above 50 mph the car has awesome mid range acceleration and is confident and sure on the road a good car for the family or put it in the ""sport mode"" and become 18 again WOOF WOOF"

like a Buick skylark in the front to me

feel! I like the options available on 
this car, but the front end just 
doesn't have the look of the newer 
sedans, however it does now on the 2004 
model.  I am leaning towards a SUV for 
perfomance, space, and options.  The 
SUV seems to be the new phase in luxury!
This cars is just a just car to me, I 
guess I am not as impressed with it as 
I thought I would be at first.  And 
there isn't that many on the road! You 
never see them.  What is up with that?  "

mitsubishi,diamante,2004,Bill T, 02/05/2007,A Good Deal,4,"I bought the Diamante for several reasons.  One is the warranty.  If you buy after 8-1-04 the second owner gets the balance of the 5 year or 60,000 mile coverage.  I also like the way it looks.  It has all the features of a more expensive car.  I looked at more expensive cars, but to buy them I would have had to go higher mileage, have no warranty, and get someone else's problems."
mitsubishi,diamante,2004,Educator, 04/02/2007,Unexpected,4,"Bought the LS model unexpectedly last Dec, and drove 7,500 miles in 3 1/2 months, mostly mixed city driving. It is fun to drive on interstates at high speeds, I did up to 110 mph on I-15. I never considered buying it but grow to like it more and more. Nice, powerful growl when briskly accelerating, strong a/c and Infinity stereo, interior power equipment, and good day-to-day qualities. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,master_pate, 03/29/2012,I miss this car,4,"Last year I had to sell my GT to make room for a family SUV, it was a very sad day. I owned the Eclipse for 6 years and never had a mechanical issue. It was fast, good looking and reliable... the perfect non-family vehicle."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Jose Rosado, 04/12/2002,2000 Eclipse GT,3,"I have not had any of the problems 
other people seem to be having with 
this car. I own one of the earlier 
2000 models with 205 horses instead of 
200 and a different manifold and 
exhaust (all factory) but strangely 
enough the engine seems to actually 
have more power now than when I bought 
it. This car does everything very 
well. Handling is good (not stellar), 
comfort is very good for this or any 
other type of car as long as you only 
carry two people, and the engine is 
the smoothest V6 I've ever driven in 
my life. I haven't had any mechanical 
problems except for a power window 
switch that was repaired under 
warranty."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,imgtgim, 10/14/2010,Sure do Like my 2000 GT Eclipse!,4,"Bought my 2000 GT Eclipse new in May 2000, and this is the first / only one I've ever bought new.  Still own it now in late 2010, and still love it!  I've never had any repair work, except typical maintenance to replace brakes, belts, tires, etc. Still runs great! When my wife tells me to ""wind-it-up baby!"" the engine purrs and the (original) muffler still has a deep-throat throttle sound.  It really is nice to drive anywhere, in-town or on the road, and I really like the pseudo shift from automatic to ""manual"" for winter driving (i.e., when bumper-to-bumper"" on snow & ice.  I'd think about trading-in for new but what's the point?  If it ain't broke, don;t fix it!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Christy, 04/24/2009,Sporty n good lookin car,4,"Bought this car in '07 with 70k, now it has 86k and still runs smooth. The only thing that I've had to replace so far were the motor mounts.. Other than that the car has been reliable and hasn't given me any problems *knock on wood* Of course, any car will last you provided you don't floor it every second and keep up with regular maintenance. Quick (v6) and fun to drive with the sportronic, nowhere near a manual tho, Decent ride on the roads. Believe it or not after 9 yrs it still turns some heads! Opening the hatch is great resistance exercise for my arms ;) Comfortable for me in the front but I feel sorry for whoever has to sit in the back but hey, that's a 2door for ya! "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,hot_karl, 05/15/2012,Best car I've owned,4,"After owning 3 Camaros I decided it was time to try something different so I went ahead and bought an Eclipse GT. I owned the car for 6 years and drove it hard all year round, did numerous cross country trips with it and had very few problems. It may not have been the fastest car out there but it was still very fun to drive. The handling felt great and the V6 sounded awesome when you revved it past 3000 rpm. Gas mileage hovered around 28-30 on my trips which consisted mostly of highway driving. I sold it about a year ago after I let a friend of mine drive it and he burnt up the clutch. Now I'm trying to find another car that was just as great as my Eclipse was. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,happyinIA, 09/07/2009,Where did my paint go??,4,"I've had my GT for just over four years now, and I absolutely love it! It's SOO much fun to drive and definitely turns heads. The only thing is, mine's turning heads for all the wrong reasons. Within a year of buying my black GT the paint started to fade, and is now almost completely gone. I've called dealers to check about paint recalls and there aren't any, but since buying my car I've seen many many other black ones with the same paint loss as mine. Other than the 'vanishing paint' I've never had to do a single thing other than routine maintenance (oil changes etc). This is a very fun car, looks great inside and out and gets surprisingly decent gas mileage. I can't wait to buy the new model!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,jetchik, 11/18/2009,I have loved this car (mostly),4,"Bought this car brand new almost 10 years ago! Mileage is 94,498. It's been good to me even though I have not always been so good to it. Have had no mechanical issues,except leak and battery. Performed all scheduled mx over the years. Had an oil pan leak last year--changed the gasket and good-to-go now. Have driven it USA cross country numerous times, and all over Europe as well. I have lived in many climates, cold, wet, hot, dry. 3500ft and it has been awesome in all. Heat and A/C work like champs! A/C cools immediately in 115+ temps! It has even been in storage for 1 yr while in Korea and sat outside for my numerous 4-6 month desert deployments. Hence the low miles/many long trips."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Ramesq, 02/27/2002,Gets Job Done,4,"It was not a difficult choice, $0 down and 1.9% financing for 5 years.  Decent acceleration, doesnt require premium gas, getting 26mpg combined, 39,700 with no problems whatsoever. Handles well and fairly quiet and comfortable.  Shifter could be smoother and abs and side air bags not offered.  Yes, there are other cars that offer more for the money (wife has Jetta with leather and abs and side airbags for same price) but in a cash crunch, Mitsu financing difficult to beat."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Alex, 09/30/2015,"250,000 and still going!!!",5,"I got this car for free with 160k miles when i sold my other car, anyways the guy drove it for 3 hrs overheating due to bad radiator so when i got it i replace the radiatorand put around 10k more miles...the car hold fine with no other issues so i decide to pump it up a little. Now it has 250k miles and dont even smoke!!! Great car but it has no $ value if you are going to sell it.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Skyler, 04/01/2008,Great Car!,5,"I bought it used at about 50,000 miles, and only had to replace the clutch and tires from the original. Believe it or not the brake pads have never been replaced in eight years!  No major problems, only maintenance costs. Very reliable car. Alright in snow.  And for some reason every girl that sees it falls in love with it.  Thats never a bad thing.  I drive all in the city and still get 25 mpg in the winter, and 28 in the winter."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,webmaiden, 07/29/2006,Loved This Car,5,"I bought this car brand new in 8-00. I have never had a minute's trouble except one time when the battery died. Other than that, I kept up with the normal maintenance, including oil changes, filters, tire rotations, tranny flush, timing belt, etc. I absolutely loved this car. I had it until the other day when a car ran a red light and I hit it. The airbags deployed and I walked away without a scratch. The car, however, suffered more damage than it was worth. I was very upset about having to give it up. I'd probably buy another Eclipse, but would definitely upgrade.

P.S. I got a great insurance settlement!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Bit, 09/09/2006,OK Overall,3,"When I first drove my 2000 Eclipse GT off the lot I loved it.  I loved the power of the torque pushing me back in the seat and the looks of the car. I even like the sound of the exaust note. A couple of years later, I still drive it and like the power. The engine is as reliable as when I drove it off the lot. The rest of the car has had minor wear and tear issues. But, the car has been the best new car I have owned.  I have not had major issues. I like the storage space in the back which shrinks away with the newer models. I can fit my whole mountain bike in the back without disassembling it and just go.  I do think the car could be lighter and be tighter on cornering."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Me Me, 01/12/2007,"2000 Eclipse, High Quality and Fun to Drive!",4,"I have driven this Eclipse for six years and have never had any major problems.  I love it!

I highly recommend it!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Eclipse driver, 11/08/2007,"I am still driving it and it has 36,868",4,"My car has never given me one bit of trouble.  I loved it from the first time I saw it.  It is red. I am the only owner and bought it new from the showroom.  The only problem I have had was the check engine light that has come on twice since I have had it. It is on now so I hope this is not the beginning of problems.  I did find out that if you do not screw the gas cap until it clicks at least 4 times that the check engine light could come on.  I think the gas cap is a little loose now, which may be the problem.  Had it checked today and said the engine was fine so don't know why the light won't go off.  I will investigate but it still drives as good as ever. I just love my car... everything!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,pjjackson, 05/07/2003,2000 Eclipse,4,"This car lacks the power of the 
previous turbo-charged Eclipse/
Plymouth Laser but the styling is 
nicer.  The 3 L six uses premium fuel 
but averages 32-34 mph on the 
highway and about 28 overall.  The 
suspension is a bit soft but, with 
good, well balanced tires, the ride is 
very good."

Before i bought this car I had a 93 eclipse with well over 220,000 miles and the only thing i had to do to it was replace the alternator. All in all these cars are worth the money."

beautiful, but being the last ""sports"" 
coupe mitsubishi made they really 
should have put a little more effort 
into it.  The quality of materials that 
have been used are very dissapointing, 
the glove box that doesn't properly

It is heavier than my friends RSX Type S, so it doesn't have the get up and go, but has smooth torque curve from the start.  The shifter is placed perfectly, and the engine revs easily.  Some design cues are hot, but the ugly plastic gas cover is horrible.     "

mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Oliver, 05/07/2003,2000 Eclipse GT,4,"After a shaky first year the car has 
been trouble free.  Two problems that 
I took the car in for: AC stopped 
cooling shortly after use (factory 
overfilled refrigerent) and remote 
lock failed (receiver).  Factory 
issued 5 recalls in first year but I 
did not experience the problems.  
This Eclipse has the Sportronic tranny 
which is convenient in the metro area 
and fun in the country."

comfortable, handles well, and still looks 
pretty good. The Tampa Blue  coke bottle 
green, really  stands out. Interior is very 
comfortable...for a sporty coupe. Mileage is 
fine, nothing special. Trunk release latch has 
never worked well, and the aluminum wheels 
are made from inferior materials: BIG 
problem, at $350-400/per. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,John D. Min, 05/28/2003,Eclipse GT 90K Still Prefect,4,"I bought the V6 GT loaded!  I know I 
might be the exception, but the car has 
been awesome and free of problems.  The 
new styling is beautiful and the car 
(manual) is fun to drive.  I owned a 
BMW 325i, but I enjoy this car more, 
the fit and finish is better and though 
the balance and control on the Bimmer 
was tighter, I paid thousands less.  
Now I have over 90,000 miles, I have 
had no mechanical problems.  I still 
have the original brake pads, timing 
belts, spark plugs, everything.
The only thing the car goes through is 
tire wear (17"" V), I am on my third 
set.  Hopefully I won't jinx 
myself, but I love this car."

power though. RS couldn't get up hill 
past 30 mph. Overall I'm pleased. I was 
already not expecting much, but it's 
more trustworthy then I thought it 
would be. Just make sure you do your 
homework."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,CoupeDriver, 04/23/2008,Fun but costly,3,I just sold my Mitsubishi Eclipse after owning it for 2.5 years.  The repair costs for this car in the 2.5 years I owned it were equal to 90% of the purchase price of the car.  I loved the car but just couldn't afford to keep paying for everything it needed done to it.  At least it never stranded me.  I miss my car; it was so much fun to drive.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,MarkBaker, 01/21/2019,"Great driver, fun and decent on gas",5,"Mine is a stick shift, V6, red with black leather interior.  It has 145,000 miles and runs great, shifts smoothly and handles great too.  I love driving this car, it has a nice sound system with a 4 disk cd changer.  It will pull decently in higher gears and you can generally drive it around in stop and go traffic in 3rd or 4th without lugging the engine, and it pulls very hard in lower gears, so much so that I'm going to pay attention since it is pretty easy to drive fast in this car.  The heater leaves a lot to be desired, research shows it has a 170 degree thermostat (that's so 60's, STOCK 170 degree thermostat), so on freezing cold days heat is barely sufficient  (it's between 0 and 15 degrees today, so I thought I'd mention it).  Other than that, I got it at a great price, and it has become a favorite driver of mine. It has SIDE airbags, rare for a 2000.  The 3.0 SOHC 24 valve is a beast, and this car is light enough that it will run with most vehicles on the road.  The trans is quiet and shifter is nice with smooth, accurate short-throws.  Back seat is actually a decent size for a normal sized person, unlike many other small two door hatchbacks.  It IS an interference engine, so the timing belt needs to be addressed since if it breaks while the engine is running it will probably lunch a few valves, at the very least-it could seriously damage the engine to the point it would have to be replaced if it damages pistons or cylinders.  The good thing is these engines are everywhere and are not too bad to install, but I will do the belt every 60-70 miles, it is not too bad a job.  Never had any issues with electrical system, suspension or controls for the seats, windows, locks, remotes, etc.  Very sturdy and easy to drive for a stick (I have 4 other cars with manual trans) and this is the easiest to drive.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,clrcode, 09/06/2005,Worst Car that I have Ever Owned,3,"Since buying my 2000 Eclipse it had the transmission re-built at about 30,000 miles, this took three weeks or more. The sunroof has never worked right. When car was under warranty it was in shop about nine times the first two years just for the sunroof. At about 65,000 miles the transmission is giving me trouble again. The car was in the shop dozens of times for different reasons. After complaining to Mitsubishi about the car while under factory warranty I was then told by the dealer if I did not stop complaining about the car they would refuse to work on it. This was said in front of Mitsubishi District Manager. Guess its okay to sell a car to you, but fixing it was another story. I would never recommend any Mitsubishi to anyone."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,say-no-to-mitsu, 06/20/2003,don't buy it...,3,"Because of this car, I will NEVER buy
another Mitsubishi.  This was the worse
car I've ever had - and that's compared
to the one I paid $700 for when I was a
teenager.

Reasons I don't like this car:
- Passenger seat wont lock into place.
- The buttons continually fall off the
dashboard and the sunroof controls
- The plastic cover over the back of the
seat falls off.
- The thing always sounds like it has a
hole in the muffler.
- It always stinks - it's got a slight
antifreeze smell.
- The glove box wont stay closed.
- too cramped inside.
- school buses have a better turning radius.

I had to terminate my lease 6 monthss
early - I couldn't take it anymore!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Tristen, 11/09/2015,BEWARE,3,"I've had this car for 2 years and it started out wonderful.After a year it started having air conditioning problems,and by problems I mean leaking in the floorboard.The clutch sticks and also the gear shifter.Its fun to drive but just isn't worth all the hassle.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Vasser, 03/18/2002,Keep Looking,2,"Initially, this car was kind of fun.  Bought it in the summer, opened the sunroof, and off I went.  Now, it is just annoying.  Not much pick up from this V6.  Clumsy handling.  The craftsmanship on my particular car has been poor.  Lots of rattles, little plasticky pieces breaking, and many general annoyances.  I should have done my homework before buying.  I hope you do."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,dacarson, 03/29/2002,A good sporty car,4,"The car has generally been quite good, except I am concerned that the clutch is not wearing well.
The interior is a little short for tall people (I am 6'2"").
The mileage has been excellent getting 24-25 mpg around town and 30-33 mpg on the highway."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,EricH, 04/03/2002,Don't buy this car,3,"This car was fun for about the first month. Then, it started falling apart a the seams. There are so many dash rattles and interior clunks and noises that I don't even drive this car anymore. Shifting is clumsy due to a poorly adjusted clutch. The engine weakens significantly with age. The handling could use work as well, cornering dynamics change badly with throttle changes. I've heard rust is also a problem, especially along structural seams in the engine compartment. This car was not worth the 22k I paid for it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,thomcat30 , 07/10/2009,Poor Interior Design and Materials,2,"The motor and transmission on this car have been reasonably reliable, there are problems with the motor mounts failing on this model, the car itself has never been weather tight meaning several leaks during rain storms etc. The car should get better gas mileage IE 25 to 27 mpg highway. The dash has been a flop. The plastic just crumbles into a heap of plastic. Don't waste your time on hiring Dr. Vinyl, just get a cloth cover and call it good."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,durbolie, 08/29/2003,Poor Black Paint and cracking dashboard,3,"Oxidized paint and 3 cracks in the 
dashboard. Black eclipse with oxidized 
paint. been painted now a few times by 
the dealership ( contracted out ). 
Paint is not oxidized, but still looks 
bad. dashboard still has 3 cracks, but

southeastern US caused it. anyone else 
with these problems...contact

I almost felt that I landed a lemon but was convinced other wise by Mitsu techs. Well, I will celebrate 8yrs of owning this marvelous car (my first ever new sports car) this 7th of June. Design - The exterior SST styling in this 3G GT - in my opinion - beats any G of the Eclipse.Performance - V6 with 205 hp - enough to pass quickly and stretch the odo (once in a while) Fuel economy - 26-27 avg on regular gas. Driving a 2000 Boxster S for the last 2 yrs, but the Mitsu is my daily road warrior with 157,000 mi and going..."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Jonathan, 06/26/2008,"107,000 miles and it's a beast!",4,The eclipse is my favorite car. At first I wanted the gts but since it was a 6 cyl I held off but I tuned this baby up I got a full cat back exhaust and cold air intake on it which makes it fly like the wind. The car is really fun to drive and handles great. My only problem was that I had to replace the slave cylinder maybe the guy who had it before me did not know how to drive but I had it for almost 2 years and I love it.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,GCW, 04/12/2002,"Not so cheap, but cheerful",4,"A great drive,always reliable (so 
far!). Good interior, feel, and stable

course, by a good quality sound system."

praise to say.  I've never had to take 
it into the shop for anything but an 
oil change, and it still drives smooth

I highly reccomend it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Mike in StLouis, 07/23/2008,Love at first drive ...,5,"I have owned this 2000 Eclipse GT since it was new.  Okay, it was a dealer demo, so it had 3k on it when I bought it but I've enjoyed every mile since. The silver bullet was a good choice for me.  From the moment that I sat in the scooped out driver's seat, I knew that this was the car for me.  I am happy to report that I've had to do VERY LITTLE unexpected work and I'm at 127,000 miles.  I've done the typical routine stuff, such as timing belts (important), tires, accessory belts, etc, but the really only unexpected repair came a few weeks ago in the form of a bad fuel pump.  Let me say it again, 127k and this was my first unexpected repair.  I'm still on my original clutch!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,MMTH4, 04/19/2002,2000 Eclipse,4,"This car is simply awesome! The new 
body style is absolutely great. 
Although it is a V4, don't hold that 
against it. It is quick, peppy, and fun 
to drive. Whenever you get ready to go 
somewhere, you get a rush of excitment! 
If you are looking for a reliable and 
fast sport compact import, this is the 
way to go! There is also a wide range 
of after-market parts available for 
those street racers out there!"

mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Michelle, 03/21/2010,"2000 GT - 146,000 miles",4,"I bought this car in 2002 with 35,000 on it. It has been a really good car. Just breaks and tires. The fuel pump did go out in 2009 and so did a bearing for my wheel. My hatch does stick, need 2 hands to open, plus the sunroof needs a hand popping open, that was like that when I bought it. I drive on the expressway to work back and forth 60 miles a day.  Not too bad in the snow for being a sports car, but looking into getting a SUV for next winter. All and all got real lucky with this car, no major problems!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,shep, 07/02/2010,Going strong,4, I bought this in 2003 with 28k miles. Always get regular service done on this car and I now have 104k miles on it. The car has held up well and it still looks great compared to others on the road. I plan to keep it going as long as I can unless something major turns up. It's been reliable and is still fun to drive. 
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,mrmd, 06/25/2002,Still as fun as day one,4,"Funny how there are a couple of 
reviews that complain about the 
interior workmanship.  I have put over 
20k per year on this can and it is as 
tight inside and out as the day I 
bought it...........not to mention as 
fun too.  It's not a Porsche or a

a Mitsubishi Eclipse."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Williams, 08/28/2002,Love My Eclipse!,4,"I love my eclipse.  It is fun to drive, 
and the fuel economy is great.  The 
only maintenance that I have had to do 
over the last 2 years and after 56K 
miles, is oil changes and tire 
rotations.  I have had to replace the 
tires, but not due to any front end 
problems or anything like that.  The 
downfall is that is sits so low to the 
ground that sometimes other drivers 
don't see you - I have almost been 
broad sided a few times - but that's 
what comes with the territory of owning 
a sports car I guess."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Kent Rebman, 08/31/2002,"Still fun, but I'm giving it up",4,"I have enjoyed driving this car a lot; it's the first car I've had in awhile with ""punch,"" but it has been troubled with oddball problems. The windshield washer sprayers quit periodically; the passenger's power window switch; the LCD panel. It's also 'invisible' to other drivers and I've felt like I've had a target on me since day one, so, I'm giving it up at lease end."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Dangull, 11/03/2002,Eclipse Rocks !! ...... For the money...,4,"I bought a used 2000 Eclipse GS as a 
second car, mainly my wife's use. She 
loves it, as do I. It is not a 
Ferrari... but it's priced like a 
Toyota!!! This Red GS really gets the 
looks. It handles very well and goes 
great with only the 4 cylinder. We had 
a 1995 and this car is even better. I 
would recommend an Eclipse to anyone 
who wants a fun car at an affordable 
price. Cheap insurance too....."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,krissie, 04/30/2002,Always trust Mitsu.,4,"Very skeptical when I purchased. Nice

then I put 65,000 miles on it. Overall, 
I am happy with it. The price for it 
was just under $18K. The 0-60 time is 
rather slow, about 8.6 secs. I would 
have liked it to be faster. The back 
seats are cramped. However, the front 
seats are rather comfortable and arch 
my back very well. I like the stereo 
system. It's loud and pretty clear for 
my ears. I like the looks of an 
Eclipse. In my opinion Celicas are 
plain ugly so I went with Eclipse. 

So far I havent had any major problems

oil, brakes, tires routine. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Great Ride, 02/13/2008,2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse,5,"I bought my silver 00 Eclipse GT in October of 99 off the showroom floor with 7 miles on the odo. I have 73000 miles on the car as of Jan 2008 and have never had any issues, just regular maintainance. It's been the most fun car I've ever owned. It spends the night in the garage so it still looks showroom new. The only minor warranty issues were that the left foot rest pad broke off, dealer replaced for free. Rear speakers lost some power and dealer couldn't figure out why. Original tires lasted 60K miles, and I replaced the rear brakepads early due to uneven wear. I would recommend a mitsubishi to anyone."

one it had major clutch - transmission

times, gearbox rebuilt and still shifts 
very hard. Dealer service never finds 
any problems. $2K in rust repair after 
being less than 2 years old and the 
list goes on.... www.deadeclipse.com

working out the bugs.  Fit & finish is 
slightly below average. Generally the 
car was holding it's own (just a 
transmission issue early on).Since the 
car reached 30,000 mi. & just after the 
36 mo. warranty was up, it's been  
really crumbling.Battery has been 
replaced, front struts are noisy, 
brakes are vibrating, hatch won't stay

good car. Few problem but covered 
through recall or warrenty.  (EXTERIOR)
Should consider 7+in wheels so there 
are more tires to replace with.  Metal 
gas cap should be standard on GT.  
(INTERIOR) I make several 700 mile 
trips and and drive 1 hr to work each 
day and I'm 6'3"". Comfort is good 
overall.  More leather would be nice 
and something to stop the noise from 
all the plastic in the dash. I average 
27mpg. I would most likely buy this car

problem yet and have almost 60k miles

I was very impressed when I slid in to 
a curb and hit one of my tires (very 
hard) and the alignment was still rock 
solid.

I have one minor glich with the 
stereo.  Sometimes the display goes 
blank but if you just turn it on and 
off, it comes back on.

Also, when the hatchback opens and it 
has water on it, the water goes into

some reason, I have busted about 4 
tires in that time period, but I doubt 
that is car related.  Just odd b/c it 
never happened with any other car I 
have had.  But its a lot of fun to

When I moved to Vermont I thought no 
way this car would last one winter.  
Now I'm on my third winter.  I put on 
studded snow tires and this car 
handles better than a 4x4.  People are

it off the lot. It was a new car with 
only 26 miles on it too. Only the 
engine and altenator were covered with 
the warranty, everything else was out

lasted up to 1 month. My out of pocket

is perfect for me, it's reassuring - 
not freaky while still fun.  The car 
also is a tank, I T-boned a vehicle at 
40 and walked away.  Car was 
rebuildable.  The final note is that 
the interior needs tightened a bit for 
world class refinement and a bit more 
firmness in the front suspension to 
keep the wheels planted in wet 
weather... otherwise a great companion."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,gmeeper, 02/28/2004,Fun and dependable,4,"When I bought this car it was only 
because it looked good and I didn't

the car for 4+ years now and am still 
amazed at how well built and 
dependable this car has been.  I've 
never had any problems with the car 
and for a sportscar is surprisingly 
spacious.  I once even crammed 7 
people into the car.  I make many 
trips to Lowe's and Home Depot and am 
still amazed at how much can fit into 
this car.  Even after all this years,

Although it's considered a bit older design now, it still looks pretty on the road and can proudly be displayed right up front in any parking lot.  With proper care and maintenance I've had no problems. She rides smoothly on the highway and has the power when I need it.  North American car makers should've taken note...the Eclipse is a sweet looking car that's fun to drive at a very reasonalble price.  This is a winning combination.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Mahaan, 06/09/2004,Great experience,4,"It's been a fun car *and* reliable & 
economical to boot.  Good-looking and 
practical!  Have not had any repair 
issues even at 75K miles.  It is 
sporty, yet can be roomy enough in a 
crunch.  Lower the rear backrests, and 
there's considerable luggage space.  
Don't like the rear visibility esp. 
with the rear spoiler. "

vehilce is very good driving through 
the snow."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,cjsmith, 07/10/2004,Still catches my eye,4,"This is a great looking, great 
sounding, pretty fun to drive car.  
When I brought it home the first day, 
my brother asked me if it came with a 
speeding ticket.  It just looks like 
you should be driving it hard.  

I mostly use it on weekends, but 
occasionally drive it to work on snowy 
days.  It handles surprisingly well in 
the snow.  

My only doubt in buying this car is 
whether it would hold up over the long 
run.  After almost five years, it's 
still doing everything that I expect.  
It's nice to have a car that still 
catches my eye and makes me glad to 
own it two years after it was paid for!"

conditions as well."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Swimster144, 08/07/2004,First Car,5,"I love everything about this car -- 
performance, looks, and reliability.  
The V6 w/ 5 spd is awesome.  The tranny 
is very smooth.  The infinity sound 
system is sweet!  The suspension 
handles well, although I wish it were a 
little stiffer.  I have aftermarket 
wheels on it, since the stock wheels 
were not my favorite, but other than 
that the exterior design of this car is 
awesome.  The modern look of the 
interior and dashboard makes it a fun 
car to be in."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,irish girl, 08/12/2004,Fun to Drive,4,"The first week I had this car I was 
rear ended at a traffic light.  I 
realized that this was a great car as 
it did not even get a dent.  It is 
built solid as a rock.  I currently 
drive 140 miles a day highway and the 
car can keep up with the best of them.  
I am looking to trade it in for a new 
Spyder.  I have no doubt that my 2000 
vehicle will give a new owner much 
pleasure for years to come."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Midwest Kid, 03/04/2006,Good for A While,3,"My 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse ran excellent for the first 50,000 miles.  Then it started to have a few little problems - the front tire kept going flat, brakes were bad, a water leak.  Nothing major, but annoying.  Mine has 75,000 miles on it and still has no major issues.  It gets great gas mileage and is actually quite pleasant on a long road trips, as long as there is only two people.  However, it surprisingly can carry a lot.  The ground clearance is minimal so I have bumper damage. "

I didn't have the car a month before I started having major problems.  The car has always run hot, even with replacing the thermostats twice, I've replaced the transmission, the sunroof has never worked properly, dashboard cracked when it was cold outside, both power window motors have been replaced,and many smaller things as well. I would NOT recommend an Eclipse to anyone"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,NeverSummer420, 04/25/2007,I love my car,4,"My car has really been good to me.  It only has 60,000 on it but it still drives like she was brand new. Granted you always have to do preventive maintenance to keep 'em running well, but it is very reliable and a very sexy car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,maverick74, 04/18/2003,RS Review,3,"After owning the '00 eclipse RS for 
3.5 years, overall i can say that the 
eclipse is decent car, its 
beautiful,reliability has been good,
but performance and handling are 
little better than my 87 escort. 
Acceleration is decent but the car is 
too heavy. The front brakes have been 
a constant problem since i have owned 
the car.(brake vibration coming from 
front) Steering is slow and body roll 
is pronounced...not too much fun on 
curvy roads. Lots of road noise at 
highway speeds.

The vehicle comes stripped bare in the 
RS trim so if you can afford it, go 
for the GS or GT. While i have fixed 
mine up, its better to get all the 
accessories from the beginning."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2000,Toledored, 04/23/2008,"Over 115,00 and still running",4,"I was third owner and bought with 68,000miles.  It is 4 years later and over 115,000 miles and running great! Very impressed with its high performance and handling.  Still zippy and fun to drive; handles very well in snow, as long as it's not too deep as the car sets low.  Have had issues with aluminum rims and having to replace tires that won't seal the rims.  Added a remote start so car heats quickly in cold.  Had to replace shocks initially, but no problem in 4 years."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,Jason, 05/16/2008,2001 Eclipse GT,4,"Bought this car when I joined the Air Force and it has been very reliable. I have driving across country three times and have never had a problem. The only down fall is that the car takes premium fuel only and it costs me 50 dollars to fill up. Was very easy to find performance parts for, and the car handles them very well."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,Steve O., 03/04/2017,16 Years & still in Love,5,"I'm the original owner, the tranny went at 120,000. I don't know why. I didn't beat it at all. Had a used transmission put it with 55,000 miles for $3000. I have 45,000 miles on the replacement tranny. I had the water pump & the timing belt & serpentine belt replaced around 130,000. The replacement water pump went in it in 2 years. I had an aftermarket water pump & it failed in a year & a half. I had another one put in it & it failed in 5 months. It was under warranty & had it replaced again. I had the EGR valve replaced & all the sensors replaced. After the EGR valve the performance picked way up & is running like new. I have 168,000 miles on her. I have no rust despite living in Wisconsin. The shocks for the hatch went bad a while ago, just too lazy to get them replaced. I had to replace the radiator at around 145,000 miles. The moon roof doesn't work due to lack of use, I assume. My struts need replacing but holding off on that. Reliable car except for the tranny issue. I still blow away other sport cars when they wanna try me. My 1st headlight finally went out 2 months ago...15+ yrs with the same headlights...pretty cool.

The v6 is torquey but still good on fuel. The manual transmission shifts smooth but has a direct feel. It leans a bit more than I'd like in sharper turns but never feels unsafe. I've never had to do any major repairs to this car. Only thing that broke was the EGR solenoid. A $40 part from the dealer. Very fun to drive and easy to to long trips in. I drive it 100 miles round trip everyday. I average about 28.5 mpg."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,luke12321, 03/01/2012,Good Car Overall but had minor issues,3,"I bought this car in 2006, it had around 45k on it.

I drove the car for about 100k miles when I owned it.

First, the car says to run premium only but I never did.
I ran regular in it the entire time and it never gave me any issues.

Issues with car:
Replaced 02 sensor, transmission was making a clicking noise, but never gave me any issues.
Sunroof gave me trouble with jumping, jerking, really rough to open.
I just stopped using it soon after buying it.
Back hatch would not stay up when opened.
Dash is cheap, it was cracked when I bought it.
 Wasn't starting well, I didn't want to deal with any longer so I sold it.

Glad I owned it, good car and low maintenance."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,Slowrider, 08/04/2007,"Great car, but do your homework.",4,"This is not a car for beginners and shorter folks. The gas mileage is decent usually 20-25 mpg, if you want v6 power you get v6 mileage. Make sure you understand repair cost if you decide to purchase this car for the long run. For instance timing belt is usually $300-500 depending on where you get it done and the MAF sensor is between $110-625 depending on where you go. It does take time to get used to seeing properly. If you are a good driver it'll take about a week. The car does understeer and takes some time to get use to but it can take bumps and bad roads fairly well."

first got it, it had alot of problems

The car itself was reliable for periods of time but when it would break, it was always expensive. Found a very low-price garage and had all of the work done there, reputable mechanic in my community but the car kept breaking down. I'm going to part ways with it since the computer died and continues to blow fuses causing the car to stall and lose power WHILE driving. Very dangerous. Clean record on the car, unfortunately whoever owned it before me abused the car. I'll miss her, kind of."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,jenni63, 01/30/2011,Poor thing...,3,"I've had my 01 Eclipse since I was 16, about 6 years now. I must say, I do love my car and have done my best to take care of it, but it loves the shop too much. Every year I have to replace the battery, and everytime it's gone out getting it to the shop is a piece of work. Supposedly the computer has to 'be reset' otherwise it completely shuts off while driving. We've replaced the battery cables, etc. but it still eats through the battery. Fortunately (from an optimistic view), when something breaks, other things (unrelated) break as well so it's killing two birds with one stone, but it's a hassle. Everyone I've known who had this car has already had to trade it in from far too many issues."

around town and around 35 MPG on long

tank makes for long legs.  This car 
has a great ride on long trips.  Very 
smooth.  You have to gas it a little 
more from the stoplight when the AC is 
running but that is to be expected 
with a 2.4L.  However, the power band

Dashboard WILL eventually crack due to cheap thin plastic, paint is fading fast(car is 2001!)bottom weather strip came off back window, shocks don't work well for the glass hatch. Other then that it looks alright and drives smooth and quick. For a car with under 60k and the price we paid there should be way less problems. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,rx8rotary04, 04/05/2014,Eclipse GT 5 sp mt,3,this was my first 5 sp mt car. it was a blast to drive for a first semi sports car. the handling was fantastic as well as the power (for what it is). a buddy of mine has the same car with not many major issues but i on the other hand got the lemon of all eclipses. bad belt bad motor mount bad tranny mount bad ebrake cable and many other things. before i sold it something would clunk and make the whole car feel as if it was about to fall into pieces but no one could figure out what it was so i had to sell the car and take a huge loss.

I read some other reviews that said the rear spoiler and small back window make it impossible to back up. WRONG! The window is HUGE, and I've never had a problem backing out in almost 2 years. She HUGS curves, and it's easy to make the tires squeal if you pull the wheel a little to one way (XD), even in the automatic. Sportronic is a MUST! SO FUN! Gas mileage is decent. The car just like great stock, and really shines with a few simple tweaks (darker tinting makes a bigger difference than you think!!!)"

Last summer I had to replace half an axle.  The radio stopped coming in and the a/c stopped working at about 90,000.  But nothing else major and I am rough on my vehicles.  I hear if you put weight in the back it handles better in the snow.  I recently crashed it.  I am having a hard time finding another vehicle. I might just buy another eclipse.   It is very comfortable to drive.  I am 5'11"" and not a stick girl either.  Be careful with the black paint. It discolors and peels off and the dealers won't deal with it."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,KC, 03/13/2009,An ok car...,3,"I have had quite a few problems with this car (most early on), mainly due to cheap parts. The headlights actually burned up the electrical wiring & had to be replaced & they're still terrible. The oil pump (bad part) caused severe engine damage. After a month of work, I had to get a new engine. The interior is the cheapest. It gets scratched up easily & snap on parts have all come off (& won't go back on). The hooks on the trunk for the back cover broke off. My windsheild wiper fluid doesnt work bc the clip that holds the tubing broke off from heat. Transmission is ab to go out w 112,000 miles.

Brakes lasted 60K, still original clutch, leather still looks great (garage kept). Still performs great.  I have been very happy with this car. I have read some of the other reviews and have had none of the issues mentioned in the negative reviews. Only criticisms I can agree with is the small turn radius (though not as big deal as some make it) and the hatch channels water into the edges of the trunk space when it is raining (only if you open the hatch all the way though).  I have had every Eclipse except the newest body style and have been the happiest with this one."

I try to keep it out of the sun, however the roof is still beginning to fade and crack a little bit. Great fun to drive, could use a little more power but that would sacrifice the decent MPG. Easy to drive. Rear spoiler in the way occasionally, but not too bad. Corner support beam could be a little smaller for better visibility, Great look, great sound. Performance alright for the price range, I would call it a very sporty car, not a sports car. Never had any major mechanical issues, it used idle a little quick but just a minor adjustment. My trunk 'lid' (part separating trunk from cabin) broke, no big deal. Not a bad buy."

I had to add lots of aftermarket parts to get decent engine performance (even having 0.4 liters more than the '97 model), and is a gas guzzler!

those cars that I have to turn around a

The interior isn't perfect, but close. 
It falls short with the steering wheel 
placement. The gauges are covered by 
the top of the wheel when the tilt is 
set for best comfort.

And this car is a blast to drive. 
There's just enough power, but the 
handling could be better. Then the 
problems start. The clutch rattles, the 
sunroof jitters when opening, the 
rotors warp VERY easily, the interior 
(dash, consoles) shakes  and I've had

The bad things about this car are the 
brakes squeal at low speeds (since day 
1),the sunroof jitters when going back

still happens). The rear hatchback

the sunroof shaking when it opens.  
This is a common problem that I will 
get taken care of.  The engine is the 
car's best feature; silky smooth with 
respectable torque.  Build quality is 
decent and have not had any problems 
with the paint so far.  The back seats 
are extremely cramped, really only 
suited for small kids.  Good value for 
the money but can be pricey if you get 
all the options.  Gas mileage averages 
26 mpg with a high of 30 mpg on trips 
driving the speed limit."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,Anna, 02/27/2002,Awesome and fun ride!!!!!,5,"This is a wonderful car.  I have the GT model and it is wonderful in the snow with the ABS, Front wheel drive and traction control.

It is so much fun to drive, especially when teenagers are trying to race you from a complete stop.  

I have not had one thing go wrong with the car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,dorothea71, 01/05/2003,2001 GS Eclipse-not a car of quality,2,"This is a sporty looking car and that 
is all that is sporty about it.  I find 
it to drive more like an underpowered 
sedan.  If you are used to a quality 
car you will be very disappointed with 
ths car.  I drove an Acura Integra 
before and I miss the quality and 
supurb handling.  I am disappointed 
with the interior quality and things 
like the doors never shutting quite 
right (the dealership just can't seem 
to fix them) and many other little 
annoying things.  Beware also if you 
buy these cars new they come with 
20,000 mile tires, so you will be 
spending the money to replace them 
shortly.  The car is hot looking, but 
overall I am very dissatisfied."

The handling is not as agile as Calica or RSX.  You should rather cross shop V6 GT to V6 Accord or Solara.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,dr_cadmium, 07/09/2003,Overpriced but lots of Fun,4,"Over all I love this car. The original 
price of $25,500 is way to high for 
what you get. Depriciation is 
redicules. The Stock RSA tires squeal 
like crazy and are burned up after 
22,000 miles. Brakes squelled from day 
one until I replaced them with power 
slots and Stillen semi-metalic brakes.

sun roof sticks and truck is heavy and 
sticks. "

the Eclipse GT will Dust most of this 
competition. It's a great open Highway 
cruise car. It only sits at 3000rpm at 
80mph. Unlike the Hondas and Acrura's. 
It has that bigger 6 torque pull. The 
inside is a tad different, and works. 
It handles good. In fact it can handle 
some nice curvy roads prety well. The 
style of this car is one of it finest 
points. It looks great. But it 
defiantly don't look like a bubble car

I've had it for 5+ years and am still learning more about how to unlock the secrets of handling and all out performance.There are fewer places now where you can open her up but, when I do, it performs like a true GT car. I'm 58 and started out driving MG's, this car is vastly superior to what those oxcarts could ever have been had they evolved to the present and embodies what a true GT car should be. I'm still enjoying it, in fact I just bought new mags for it.  James Bond wasted her Majesty's money on the Aston, he should have gone with the Eclipse."

I've replaced the oil sensor ($125), had the brakes re-surfaced 4 times (stock rotors are horrible), motor mounts, had to have the heat shield removed because it was making noises, there are rattles all over the car, I have 2 bent rims (each would be $400 from the dealer), the stock tires are junk, the clutch rattles when disengaged in netrual, and the transmission likes to grind for no reason!  Not to mention the bearing rattle that everyone has.  Do your research! There are many websites out there that will tell you all the problems these cars have.

Positive: fun to drive, stylish, V6 is really powerful. Negative: after 10K miles the heat won't work immediately (take 30 mins. This is bad during winter, especially living in NY), transmission problem after 75K (Costs $1200-$3500 depending upon the type of mechanic and new/old part used), there are minor electrical problems, mainly the headlight won't work every 6 months. The power steering takes larger curve. I could never make a smooth U turn in the last 7 years - it was always broken U turn."

car gets me to where I am going has a 
great sound system and is definitely 
fun to drive. The original sticker 
price was about 26,000 dollars which is 
way out of the market for what it is 
worth. If you can get it for around 
12,000 dollars your getting a good 
deal. My particular car was built at 
the Bloomington Illinois facility. I 
have learned a hard lesson on this car 
and about purchasing things overpriced. 
As far as the car itself goes it is 
reasonable in costs to repair needs 
little maintenance and is great to 
drive on the open road."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,Gerardo Ceballos, 08/23/2007,Fun Car,4,"Great car in my opinion, very fun to drive, mine is manual and the gears and the shifts are very sporty, the clutch is soft. It has a quick response when you switch to a lower gear, it has reasonably good acceleration for a 4 cylinder. I have had no trouble with the engine nor transmission.  The interior is comfortable for the driver and one passenger if you are not big or tall. No room for the back seats, maybe for a child.  The ride is very comfortable, the suspension is not that hard.  It has good grip around corners.  It is a bit noisy on the highway.  In general a great car, I would buy again."

The aggressive stance and throaty exhaust note were two of the first things that attracted me to it.  That, and all the looks I got from people when I would pull up to a store.  Now while I have added to it (custom cold air intake, short throw shift kit, lowering kit, custom cat- back exhaust, and after market wheels and tires) the car has needed little work to make it a blast to drive."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2001,Bradleyc, 03/14/2002,Hard to Eclipse an Eclipse,5,"This is an all around fun GT car.  No, it's not a ""sports car"" like a Porsche, it's a GT car like a Lancia or Alpha Romeo.  The car has excellent pick up and good cornering.  The car can be pushed much harder than most drivers realize.  As such, early body roll halts at .7 G's and then you can really feel the car dig in.  The torque band is very broad, but if you push the rev's a little bit (4200 RPM's) the car definitely takes off."

Other than that, this car is mechanically in great shape. It runs perfect, sounds good and just looks sexy. Mine has 152k and has just needed regualar maintainence. If you keep it up to date, then it will run. Ive seen many of these 4 cylinders hit 250k and still run great. Engine mounts and tranny are common things to replace a bit earlier than usual, other than though it runs and wont leave you with an empty pocket. Fuel econ. is decent though. "

We have not had any major problems- just regular maintenance.  The work done so far is:  at 80,000, we replaced the motor mounts and now it runs as smooth as it did when new.  At about 70,000, we replaced the radiator and some hoses.  We had to replace the brake pads a few times but that pretty much was it.  The A/C in the AZ 120 summers.  The auto trans is great.

But the car is reliable as long as you maintain it. And it is almost 20 years old. I love this car but I am thinking about replacing it and getting a newer car. Not because of any issues but because it's almost 20 years old. I think I need some updated safety features. 🌝

Anyways, this car is very reliable. Sure, after owning a car for 9 years it's bound to break down sometimes. Thankfully, my dear car has never left me stranded anywhere. What was wrong wit it? Usually after market things I had installed (like the alarm).

She is pretty old and replacement parts have been needed. The things that hold the hatch stopped working, so I got them at a junk yard for like $5. The A/C juuuust broke down on me, lol, i used that thing all the time, even in the winter. Dash had to be replaced, thats all. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2002,Zach, 02/16/2016,Great First Car,4,"Pretty damn good true first car. This is the first car i bought on my own. My sisters boyfriend is actually the reason i got one. He owned a 2007 Eclipse manually v6. I wanted one right away after driving his for awhile. I liked the look of the 3g Eclipse though and i bought mine before going to college with around 110k miles. Wanted to impress the girls so to say with the car. Love the way the car looks and love that its manual. This is a great car to put aftermarket parts in and make that 4 banger run. 

Pros:
Fun car to drive around in 
Great handling can pull turns going 85mph with breeze 
Very light car
Looks great
Fun car to put money into

Cons:
Interior is pretty cheap material 
AC is shot don't work
Cruise control is shot doesn't work
Back seats uncomfortable


Overall not a bad car if you can find one with low miles as these models tend to have a lot of problems when getting up there in miles. Car will run way better if you invest money into the car and its performance.

thats about it.  The car hums and

The roof leaks and my radio will not work.
I had to replace the rims because they ALL cracked.

I will certainly miss my '02 Eclipse, but it was time for something more family friendly.

First, the negatives, to get them out of the way (no issues for the first 5 years of ownership - all of this occurred after 5 years):

The sunroof was jittery when opening, had to be assisted in popping up, the hatch wouldn't stay up by itself in cold weather, the dashboard cracked on it's own, center speaker blew/dry rotted at 7 years, O2 sensor needed replacing and so did the A/C compressor condensor."

The 4 cylinder model was not very

Honda Prelude and the Eclipse, while 
not as fast or sleek looking, is darn 
good. The V6 can almost keep up. The 
interior is nice and the body style is 
kind of muscly, which I like. My only 
complaints would be that the doors are 
very large and heavy and are always 
falling on me getting in and out. And 
there is absolutely no head room in the 
backseat. But then it is a hatchback."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2002,christopher, 07/13/2009,Great car,4,"Great car. Bought this car new, had it about 7 1/2 years; car has never had any major repairs, just regular maint. I have never even had a tune up and it has over 150,000 miles. Gets average 25 miles to a gallon; on highway only about 27. It's been a great car."

I owned mine for 5 years and sadly I was in an accident last night and it is totaled. I am so upset - I absolutely love this car. The turning radius is incredible, it's so fun to drive, the sound system is great, the seats are comfy, the exterior is sleek, I could go on forever. Most importantly though - I've had absolutely NO major problems with this car ever in 5 years. The radiator cracked about a year ago but I patched it and it was fine. It had 133,000 miles on it and still ran like a newbie. In my accident - the airbags deployed and saved my face. The damage is impressive - I expected so much worse. This car is built GREAT. RIP my dear."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2002,MitsuBenji913, 08/01/2010,A fun car with minor problems,4,"I haven't had my 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT very long, but I already love it. The car itself looks great, I've had random people on the street comment on it and often see people watching my car drive away. The inside looks good too, with the leather and design, but the controls could look a little better. Appearance isn't everything but they know that. This car had a lot of power and is a lot of fun to drive. Most other cars are left in the dust, although this does hurt the fuel economy a bit. It's painfully apparent that Mitsubishi does make these cars cheaply, though. The previous owner had to replace the clutch and I've read about major problems this car has. I still recommend it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2002,dking, 08/10/2010,I love my Eclipse,4,"I've owned a 2002 Eclipse RS for nearly 9 years. For the first 8 this car was perfect. Only scheduled maintenance, not a thing went wrong. In the last 10 months things have started to go. Oil pan rot. Never heard of it and could be due to living in New England. That was expensive. Air conditioner compressor, again expensive. Front struts, VERY expensive! Slave cylinder for the clutch, low cost to repair but was a major inconvenience. Rear gate lifters went the first winter in Maine. car was 5 years old at that time. I just use a stick to hold up the gate. The car has 88,000 on it and just had it's first brake job. Not bad. It's up for sale. Just bought a new Altima but will miss my Eclipse."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2002,Happy Consumer, 06/29/2002,Very Tight Ride,4,"This is our 2nd Mitsubishi, first was a 
Diamanta.  Got a GT with manual tran (a

the V-6) and the premium pkg. Love the 
sport leather seats and dashboard 
design.  Must accept that this is a 2 
person car only; back seat is way to 
small for anyone not in a carseat.  
Mitsubishi must do something about 
there lifters; they go bad after 70k 
(right after you pwr tran runs out) and 
your tight ride start smoking. You can 
count on this ask any long term owner 
of a Mitsubishi.  Very Very Very fun to

a clutch/throw-out-brg issue. Check 
the web owner's groups to see.  Mitsu's 
warranty coverage is a joke - said 
owners groups are full of reports of 
people refused warranty repairs. Despite 
 advertising claims, it's no sports car, 
just a Galant with a body kit.  If you

mitsubishi,eclipse,2002,Ethan, 11/30/2015,"Fun to drive, but very unreliable",2,"Interior plastics are garbage.  My dash was so severely damaged from the sun, chunks of it were caving in.  I have seen 30 year old cars in junk yards with dashes in better condition.   Had to buy an expensive cover for it. 

Transmission got very loud at about 5 years old so I had all bearings replaced and new clutch.  Less than a year later the throw out bearing went and it was back for new bearings and another clutch within a year of it breaking.  

CV joint snapped while driving it about 5 months ago and took me it the oil filter which caused a big oily mess in the middle of a very busy intersection where it broke down. 
Clutch master cylinder broke and car had to be towed for that to be replaced. 

Axle seals have been replaced 4 times with after market and factory seals and still leak, huge mess in driveway from axle fluid. I had never even heard of a car needing axle seals to be replaced before this. 

Headlights were terrible from the day I got it so I drove around with high beams on all the time to see anything at all at night.  Replaced those with aftermarket lights and they are much better.  

Floor and rear wheel wells are rotting out along with bottom of rear quarter panel on passenger side.  Roof had some rust/rot forming that was repaired. 

At 4 years old the power steering pump died, $700 part alone.  Valve cover gasket and strut mounts also had to be replaced at that time.  

Sunroof motor has never been able to open sunroof on its own without me having to push it up to open it.  

Key fobs fell apart and had to be replaced after only a few years.  

2015 has had at least $4000 of repairs to this car with at least two dozen visits to mechanics in last 6 months.  I have probably forgotten to include many other repairs it has needed. I have now had the car for a little over 10 years and it has been a problem from the start.  Now, something new seems to break every time I drive it.  Currently at mechanics since exhaust pipe is rattling around slamming against car frame causing a lot of noise whenever I go over a bump in the road.

Great Exterior look, except the fake vents in the front.v6 engine good power for automatic shifty, not good for turbo boosting.Alloy wheels great touch and clean. Inside, Cheap plastic interior (which is good If you ever need to replace it). I like it. No leg room for people over 5'11. Very small in the back, good for newborns- preteens and adults, no. Seats are very comfortable for long driving. Gas mileage is good, 22 ct/27 Hw. $30 to fill. Slow start@shifting through 1st gear but gets better at 2nd. Expensive 6 cyl tuneup ($550). Timing belt+labor $640. Maintenance regular. Premium gas only. Mits is having a recall, don't get black."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,John Griffith, 01/05/2017,A great car that seems to last forever. . .,5,"What can I say about this car?  It has been an excellent and fun daily driver for the past 14 years and is still going strong.  I have owned it since new and it has never let me down.  Oh sure there was an occasional flat or dead battery but those are maintenance items.  Keep up with the maintenance on it and it wont have any problems.  I don't think the car has ever actually failed.  It always starts right up no problems, when the battery was good that is.  I've gone through oh 4-5 batteries on it.  5 timing belts and one transmission. The transmission?  yes that did eventually fail . . . at ~320,000 miles!  I don't really think of that as a failure, just wear and tear.  It was worn out.  The guy working on it said he had never seen such wear.  Even in that state It didn't leave me by the side of the road.  I was able to drive it to a shop,  it was just acting funny,  like taking 5 seconds to shift.  Even so, 320K miles for a transmission is hard to beat in any car.  I have no complaints.   I'm not kidding this car has 377 thousand miles on it.  Original engine, and never been overhauled.   It did have lifter tick (very noisy) at 220K but I replaced the lifters (lash adjusters), which is a job you can do just under the valve covers, and it has not been an issue since.  Overall I'd say the build quality of the car is super high given the longevity I've gotten out of it.  There is very little rust on the car too.  The ride is solid and smooth as can be, even at interstate speeds.  Just keep it aligned and replace the shocks when they are due.  Again maintenance.   I trust this car as my daily driver to get me to work every day.  The engine is still strong and can still accelerate hard when I need it to.  It still gets 26-27 miles to the gallon if you aren't a lead foot.   If you keep it maintained this car will last a long time.  It does lack a bit in the radio department compared to today's radios but still sounds great.  What the radio doesn't do is bluetooth or have an aux input or navigation.   If you want all that you can upgrade it easily as it is a standard 2-din (size) radio.  All the stock speakers save one are still in it and sound great.  The only speaker to fail me was the one in the center of the dash and that was due to direct sunlight and age drying out the cone.  If you disconnect that speaker however you really don't miss it.  I do think I will need to eventually overhaul the engine, one day, I'm not deluding myself there.   Just not tomorrow.  The last shop I had it at told me the compression is still good and within factory spec.  It is starting to leak/burn oil though.  What else can I expect  from it . . . it is positively ancient in miles.   I suspect the valve stem seals are the cause, I never replaced them. .  Again I have no complaints,  it has held up so well over the years that if it is only now in need of that after all those miles, I'll just smile and pay some shop to fix it.  Its better than a new car payment and this car still looks good.  Most people never guess that it has that many miles on it unless I tell them and they they do a double take and still don't believe it.  I get it a lot from the shops that service it.  One last thing, don't ever skip an oil change and don't put anything less than premium in it.  I put mid-grade 89 in it ONCE back in 2005 I think. . . never again.   The mileage dropped to about 20 MPG and it ran like a PIG.  I shudder to think what 85 would have done.  I saved 10% cost on the gas (30 cents on 3$) but had to use 35% more gas to get where I needed to be (27 vs 20 mpg).   It is counter intuitive to some, but you actually save money using the premium gas.  That and the car will behave better and actually pass other cars when you need it.  Use the gas it was designed to use.

I didn't have any mechanical issues besides the sun roof which is a known problem.
Went to get the car inspected this summer and was told the bottom of the car was rusting out.
The mechanic showed me the apple sized hole right underneath the drivers side floorboard and another spot below the gas tank and the fuel filler neck and the trunk lid!
The car has some major issues here as certain areas are prone to collect water.
Make sure you check these areas before you buy!"

It was February, and the salesman was discouraged as he walked me to the lot, and the car was under a pile of snow.
He said all he had was a 4 cylinder with standard transmission... I didn't let on, but that's EXACTLY what I wanted.
The car has been a dream to own.


I have performed regular maintenance with my own mechanics.
I never went back to the dealer, and never needed to.
Oil changes every 3000, and regular timing belt changes were the bulk of maintenance.
Also plugs every 60k.


I replaced two tie rods, and recently an axle (after 189,000).
Two sets of brake pads.
That's about it.
I love this car, and I don't want to part with it."

When that car was rear ended and totalled in december i purchased a 2003 eclipse GTS gun metal grey. It has 74k and running great. My 01 got up to 212k and was running like a champ. Just do your sched maint. and keep an eye on problem areas. Both have been 5 speed and the feel of the clutch and the way the shifter pops into place is great. Very fun car to drive especially in the summer with the windows down and sunroof open. as long as you take car of the car and keep up with it the eclipse will treat you right. even stock its a head turner.

Now the BAD.
The Flywheel and clutch went.
Replaced them at Don Herring Mitsubishi in Plano Texas Thanks JT.
Then the ABS light came on.
I'll go to Auto Zone and get the Code and fix it myself.
So far the second best used car I have owned next to my old 1999 Honda Accord CPE V6.
AGAIN I do not race. The only upgrade is an INJEN Intake system.
Hopefully I can trade it in next year for a 2011 Dodge Charger or challenger.
But my 2003 MITS GTS is one of the best reliable used cars you can buy hands down."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,vkmicro, 09/22/2014,Beautiful car and fun to drive,4,"Well let me start off with comparing it to different cars I drove and took for a test drive.
Before eclipse I used to drive 4 door sedans, and comparing to the sedans, Mitsubishi eclipse has much more maneuverability on the roads both on high speeds and around the city. Comparing to the Grand Prix 1997 which I used to have, it's slightly worse on the snow because it's a lot lighter weight, so have to drive with more caution. 
I have a GS edition with automatic transmission and it's awesome, it's really fast and like I mentioned before very agile on the road. Overall I give the car 9/10, wish it was slightly better designed inside (EX: Better cup holders) but it's fun and looks amazing. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,sara_huntley, 06/06/2013,Fun to Drive!,4,"I bought my Eclipse from a private seller in Aug 2012 with 119, 990 miles on it which turned to 120,000 on the way home. The guy didn't tell me all of the problems that came with it but that was expected. The car was over 100k and obviously needed some repairs due to its age. They were all minor fixes that were neglected.
Throughout the couple months of fixing these things the car ran very well. I have never been stuck on the side of the road! I love that it came with the power shift for accelerating even with a 4-cyl. With regular maintenance this car can go for 200k+ miles! "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Term, 04/06/2016,"My first officially owned car, totally worth it",4,"The 2003 GT Eclipse is great! I recently traded it in for a brand new Mazda3 which is also fantastic, but I often find myself missing the Eclipse even though my Mazda3 is fully loaded and is very fun to drive itself! The car drove extremely well but certainly was not meant to be tuned as it wasn't fast and the engine was.... interesting to work on to say the least. That's certainly not saying that it was not fast enough to pass other cars with ease when called upon.

She was an absolute head turner, I powder coated the stock rims black and put limo tint on the windows which REALLY made her stand out from the crowd. When I had the sunroof flipped out, she was one of the sportiest cars on the road. I didn't have the leather interior but it was still perfect with how Mitsubishi laid everything out. The sound package that came with her was fantastic and I never needed to touch it as it was spot on. I did, however, swap the head unit with something more modern (bluetooth). Mechanically, this car was partially sound. Downsides were replacing wearing parts such as the timing belt (yes, it has a timing belt in the v6) and maintaining the suspension which became a headache near the end of my ownership. The cruise control solenoid failed near the end too, which left the ""Cruise"" light on and the actual unit unusable.

Another issue that apparently a lot of Mitsu's have is the engine burning and leaking oil, which at 139,000 miles on mine was a serious problem, every gasket on the engine was leaking oil (head gasket, valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and even the main rear seal which was NOT WORTH IT TO FIX AT ALL). I did a lot of the maintenance work on it myself such as replacing a cracked radiator which resulted from road debris, the front bumper which a truck backing out of a parking spot poked a hole into with their hitch, replacing spark plugs and cleaning the intake. I can't say my knees didn't take a beating from doing this work as a result of the v6, but at the end of the day it was easy and Mitsubishi designed this car to be easy to maintain and allowed me to cut my teeth on car maintenance for the first time. It had very slight rust issues but that's easy to overlook because it only affected specific parts of the car.

I love this car and would recommend it to anyone. I enjoyed it and still really miss her, wish that I could have kept her but the dealer gave me a trade-in offer that I couldn't pass up. I hope if anyone ever owns my car in the future, they can fix her up properly and give her a garage that I always wish I could have provided. :)

mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,kobo1d, 09/09/2009,Underrated Car,3,"I've had my Eclipse GTS Automatic for a little over 4 years and it has been a very nice car. Bought used, still under factory bumper-to-bumper warranty, I've driven it hard (currently at 67000 miles) and have had very little issues with it. The only problems with the car have been some electrical issues: The factory 6-CD player completely stopped working, refusing to play and making a horrible crunching sound constantly. Mitsubishi wanted $450 to fix it, so I just replaced it with an aftermarket setup. The switch for the passenger side window only rolls the window up, not down, so the passenger has to roll down their own window. Sunroof switch is touchy. And yes, the plastic scratches easy."

It hasn't given me problems other than routine maintenance (brakes, tires, battery, belts).  The sportronic transmission is awesome, although I don't use it as much.  I am selling it now because I need a bigger vehicle.  Will miss it for sure.  Would buy a new eclipse again if the body style on newer eclipses are similar to the 00-05 models."

I've been driving it for only about 2 1/2 months now, but every second has been amazing. My friends tell me how good it looks, and how good it sounds for a 4-cyl.

poor quality engine components.  Wait 
until you go through a winter with 
snowy, salty roads and watch your

make it to 36,000 miles your 
transmission is likely to 
start giving coast down clunks and 
clicking noises.  Poor quality rims 
dent easily on 2002 models. Intake and 
exhaust systems are inefficiently 
designed, negatively effecting 
performance.  Beautiful car from the 
exterior, after a year looks like a

receive when driving it.  It's cool to 
see other's driving one. I do feel the 
car should have more colors.  I 
purchased the silver one and everyone 
seems to have the same color."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,kay juneau, 08/23/2009,My fun car,5,"I loved my car. IT has been excellent but one thing I don't like is the whole dash cracked on it other than that I would not give nothing for my car ever. I like my eclipse so much I kept it and bought myself another one, a 2007. I hope that I will enjoy it as much as my 2003 I still have."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Wilhite, 11/10/2009,Great gas mileage!!!!,5,This car gets great gas mileage! I get an average of  32.5 miles per gallon! My car is a V6 and it really packs a punch! Gets lots of compliments. Glad I purchased it!
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,netlisa22, 06/17/2002,Great Car! Superior Handling/Suspension,5,"Just got this car, everything is 
perfect. It takes high speeds like it 
doesn't feel a thing. Smooth ride, 
quiet, comfortable, fast. I love the 
body style, and sunroof. The interior 
lights are under the rear view mirror, 
no reaching behind you to turn them on 
and off. I like the orange gages. You 
hardly have to reach to change the 
radio station. There are places to 
store your stuff, and they even light 
up!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Jason2, 06/18/2002,2003 Eclipse GTS with Automatic Trans,4,"oh yes! It is what i want.
I uesd to have Honda Prelude. but it is 
better than Prelude. and goes very well."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,crumptown, 06/21/2002,Mitsubishi Eclipse for me,4,"I have driven several sports cars over 
the years and this one compares 
favorably to the rest.  The handling is 
excellent and it seems to grip the road 
like a larger car.  I was surprised to 
see it classified as a subcompact 
because it feels larger than that.  All 
in all an excellent buy."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,MC, 03/29/2010,One exellent Ride,4,"I bought my Eclipse GT @ 74k miles. Now 2 3/4 years later its up to 121,645 and not one major problem has occurred. I have done all scheduled maintenance as per the service manual, and I always use 91 octane fuel and synthetic oils. My car is a blast to drive especially with windows and sunroof open and the 600 watt sound system blasting my favorite rock music. My car obtains between 24/28 mpg and have recorded an astounding 32 mpg on one tank for a 1k mile trip one way on a 3.0L V6 automatic! For those who complain about bad mpg just remember what Jeremy Clarkson said ""it's not what you drive but how you drive it"" case in point Prius vs. M3 mpg test, Top Gear."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Flossem, 06/23/2002,You Will Love the Eclipse GTS!!,5,"This is a Fun sportscar...drives 
well...haven't come upon anything I 
don't like with this car yet! It looks 
great, drives great! I just love it! 
Having owned a GT Eclipse in 98, this 
is a huge improvement...on style, 
driving ability...just all around a 
real fun car to drive!!"

Very cool."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,superstar, 07/15/2002,2003 Eclipse GS coupe,5,"Just got an Eclipse GS coupe yesterday.  
So far it is a good car.  It's cute, and 
fun to drive but also practical.  
Mitsubishi's ""Zero zero zero"" finance 
program is great."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Patricia Gaul, 07/17/2002,Fun,5,"I have never owned a sports car before, 
so it is hard to compare.  I love the 
way it looks, though.  It is not a 
family car so you can't criticize the 
small back seat.  It handles very well 
and has lots of pick up for a 4 cyl.  
The gas mileage is also impressive."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,finfan, 07/24/2002,2003 Eclipse GT,4,"  This is the second Mitsubishi Eclipse 
that I have bought in the past five 
years.  This car is very reliable and 
its looks are great.  One thing I do 
suggest is put some money away for a 
new stereo because the factory one is 
terrible.  Also the v-6 is great but it 
is not as fast as the old turbos that 
were in the older Eclipses.  Even with 
those things being said I still love 
this car.  The new design is great and 
you will get some looks while driving 
in it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Darkillusionz19, 07/28/2002,The greatest thing since Snickers!,5,"In my personal opinion this vehicle is 
very SWEET! it handles like a dream, it 
has enormous power for a 6-cylander, 
the body style looks aggressive enough 
to scare down a stock car. The interior 
is one of a kind with it's technical 
style. As far as mileage per gallon 
it's great for a 6. Overall this car is 
extraordinary!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,StacyMarie, 08/28/2002,MY GTS,4,"I love my Car. It looks great drives 
great. Out of many compact imports this 
is a very powerful car. I LOVE IT. =)"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,CabindaJoe, 08/29/2002,2003 GTS has potential,4,"This new form of eclipse is rather 
impresive.  Just don't try and race 
redlight to redlight with the A.C. on.  
The 6 cyl. engine does have some pep 
and if you don't mind sweating when it 
is hot outside it is very fun to 
drive.  There is a severe blind spot.  
Aftermarket parts are hard to find 
right now, but I am sure they will come 
soon.  Gas mileage is good for a 
sportscar.  Insurance is relatively 
low.  It is not considered a sports 
car.  Same mitsubishi low rent interior 
condiments, but they look good.  
Overall this is a very nice car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,tprice, 08/30/2002,Zoom zoom? Please!,4,"Torque.

Even the Acura RSX R-type is
under-torqued, but in this price range
the Eclipse has THE most torque (215f-p
in the GT).  Now, if you're  a novice,
you're saying ""what's the big deal about
torque, what about horsepower?""  Well,
it's the torque that peels you off the
pavement, grips those nice 17 inchers in
to the tarmac, and pushes you back into
the seat with some G's to make taking
off from a stoplight a fun experience. 
And leaving the sportronic tranny in 1st
for the takeoff, upshifting in the high
5000s and hearing that exhaust race up..."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,MerleB, 09/05/2002,Never rec'd this many complements,4,"I bought this vehicle partially based 
on the rather negative review by the 
Edmunds staff. Basically the stuff they 
didn't like is what drew me to the 
vehicle. We don't do much ""canyon 
carving"" in Michigan.

My dealer had to go to Ohio to find a 
bright red GT for me, but it was well 
worth the wait as I've never had a new 
car that received more raves from the 
onlookers. 

I do miss the 40 miles per gallon that 
our '98 Eclipse achieved, but that was 
a 4 cylinder."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,NoMore Fords, 09/06/2002,Don't hesitate on this one....,4,"I traded my POS 01 Mustang GT in for 
this car after Ford refused to fix my 
transmission with 6800 mi. This car is 
great. Refined, elegant, and sporty. 
The GTS's variable induction V6 is 
strong and with the tranny in sport 
mode the acceleration is felt. The car 
feels slow sometimes because the engine 
is so smooth and quiet but then you 
realize you are doing 85 or 90mph. 
Noticed some vibration at the steering 
wheel when at speed, some torque steer, 
a rattle on the passenger side and the 
passenger seat shakes some. I will have 
the dealership look into these. Other 
than that great car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Rosa, 09/07/2002,Best car I've driven so far!,4,"So far it drives wonderful.I never 
thought that I will like this car so 
much.I love to drive it every where.I 
turn heads when I'm driving down the 
street.I love it!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Unhappy comsumer, 09/07/2002,Unhappy consumer,3,"Not long after I purchased the 
vehicle, I noticed that 5th gear, my 
window, my brakes, and my a/c were 
giving me problems. I took my car back 
to the dealer where they repaired 
fifth gear, my window, and attempted 
to eliminate the awful smell from the 
a/c. After receiving my car back, 2nd 
gear began to grind and I noticed my 
cigarette lighter was defective. So I 
returned the car to again have them 
work with the transmission, to clean 
the a/c, and replace the cigarette 
lighter. The dealer repaired the a/c, 
the lighter, but said they could not 
confirm the problem with 2nd gear. 
I've now been back 2 more times and am 
currently seeking an attorney."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Scott Miller, 09/15/2002,2003 Eclipse GTS,4,"It hauls ass! Very fast car for the 
money but i do suggest turbocharging it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,kswnfrd, 09/16/2002,"Wind Noise, Wind Noise, Wind Noise!!!",3,"The wind noise on both door seals as 
well as the hatchback is TERRIBLE!!   
The seals are poorly constructed and 
placed, and the overall door and 
hatchback seal is extremely poor.  Also 
leaks water above the door windows when 
washed.  Have been to dealer 3 times in 
4 weeks, and was finall told it was 
a ""design thing"" and was normal for the 
2002 and '03 Eclipses.  Have also 
talked to other Eclipse owners with the 
same problem."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Gonzo, 09/24/2002,Give this car more credit.,4,"Most car buying guides recommend a 
Celica over the Eclipse, and I have no 
idea why.  I test drove both, and 
while the Celica has a little bit more 
get up and go at lower speeds, once 
you pass 55 it starts acting like it's 
being tortured.  The sun, sound and 
leather package is well worth the 
money, and the car remains comfortable 
even over long road trips (there 
wasn't enough room for my legs in the 
Celica's front passenger seat). The 
engine is well presented compared to 
the reservoir-covered Celica, and 
feels more like a sports car.  The 
steering is very responsive, and the 
transmission is easy to manipulate.  
I'm very happy with it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Screenburn, 10/14/2002,If you are looking for a fast ride,4,"I have only had the vehicle for 3 days, 
and i still can't get enough of it i 
love just driving.  The best features 
of the car are the leather interior, 
and the massive amounts of torque.  I 
love the tan leather but realy don't 
like the two tone black on blueish 
black leather.  The two tone takes away 
from the sex appeal of the car.  The 
torque is great you don't have to be a 
race car driver to get into the engines 
sweet spot.  This car wil take most 
sport compacts off the line.  Even 
though the car weight in just over 3400 
lbs with a 5 spd it still handels well 
for a car of its girth."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,jendel, 10/15/2002,I fell in love,4,"When I first went out looking for a new 
car I had no interest in the Eclipse at 
all.  Then I drove it....and fell in 
love! Everyting about this car is great 
from the sleek exterior to the sunroof."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,JHope, 10/18/2002,What's the deal?,4,"So far I haven't found any reviews online of the 2003 GTS, 
and the old reviews seem to find the eclipse inadequate and 
""not fun to drive"" compared to other cars in it's class.  I test 
drove a handful and found the eclipse GTS the only car to 
put a smile on my face.  The pickup is excellent and it 
maintains speed easily - the car hits 100 like it's no big deal, 
no excess noise or vibrations.  Ride is very smooth and I 
love it for my long highway co"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Princessadri, 10/23/2002,5 Stars for the Eclipse GT,4,"I love this car cause not only does it 
look good  it rides good! All my 
friends are jeolous. It really beats my 
Grand Prix GT... I love the body style 
and the two toned leather. You sure do 
get some head turning on the road. Last 
but not least i also love the Euro 
lights in the back!That was a nice 
touch to the 2003!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,mb1982, 10/16/2002,I finally bought one,4,"Great packaging design on the elcipse 
good city car, plenty of room for two 
poeple in the front without felling 
cramped, unlike the previous 
iteration. Love the manual/automatic 
trany.  Great power and handling.  
Interior fit and finish are good, 
however texture of the platics bits 
should be upgraded for a 
higher quaity appearance.  Also have 
notice parting line flash on 
information pod located in the center 
of the dash.  Exterior fit and finsh 
are good, door and deck lid seems are 
even, paint quality is good little to 
no orange peel on the extieor pieces. 
Not paint variation noted between metal 
and plastic painted parts (I have a 
white eclipse)."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,clk_dlk, 10/12/2002,Buy It!,4,"Wasn't my first choice of car but after 
test driving the Celica, VW GTI V6, and 
the Mitsu, the Mitsu won hands down. 
Long drives are no problem and gas 
milage seems high for a car like this, 
but no complaints on that! Seems a 
little sluggish in the lower speeds but 
watch out or you'll be hitting 85 and 
not know it. Biggest problem is getting 
any after market items. Mitsubishi has 
that area cornered for now."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,melissa, 10/07/2002,Love to drive!,4,"I LOVE my '03 GS, it's everything I 
wanted in a car...fun to drive, cute,

Wish I had a longer commute to work.  
Does 55+ MPH ""like buttah!"""
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,ChristianGT, 10/11/2002,POOREST PERFORMANCE,4,"The eclipse's had a sharp exterior and 
interior design but the performance is 
not too good for me. Its a V6 engine 
200hp but not really kicks'in on the 
road. When i first drive the eclipse it 
gives me a little impressive but when i 
test drive the other sport coupes ive 
saw some more power to kicks'in than my 
eclipse But its ok i still love this 
car of course!!!=)"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Duke_BlueDevil113, 09/25/2002,Couldn't Have Hoped For A Better Car!,5,"What can i say about this car... not 
only is it a HOT car, but I got it 
under the zero payments for 390 days 
and zero interest ever, great 
incentive! Im a college student in a 
new location and I needed a car that 
would be reliable, but fun too... I 
debated between the Eclipse, Celica, 
and Acura RSX. After driving all of em 
I found that the Eclipse was the best 
car, and man am I glad I chose it! I 
got the upgraded stereo AND ITS 
AWESOME! Great young guy car! By the 
way... Edmunds.com was more than 
helpful when choosing the right car!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Rick3, 10/28/2002,Won Me Over,4,"I really did like the Eclipse because 
of the lack of power compared to 
others in it's class. The new GTS 
changed my perception. The extra 10 
horses makes all the difference in the 
world. The car is fun to drive and the 
leather interior is much improved over 
other models. It's very quick off the 
line and has solid handeling."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,dadive, 10/11/2002,not a porsche but close enough,4,"It gets up at any speed. I dhave no 
clue about the rear passengers, but 
the front is very comfortable and the 
shifting is very easy and the clutch 
is fast in response which makes it 
easy to shift fast. The sound system 
is good. Handling is ok but the 
suspension is not that great, but 
almost all sports cars are like that."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,rmob, 11/12/2002,Fun but comfortable.,4,"The GS is probably the best deal at 
around 19K plus change. I got mine 
with the sun roof and the upgraded 
Infinty CD and it was worth it. (They 
also upgrade the wheels with the 
package) I drives and handles well but 
don't expect to get whiplash. Overall 
I am very happy and would recommend 
it. Other than the bucket seats, the 
interior leaves a little to be desired."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Obi-Wan, 11/23/2002,Good combination of sport and luxury,4,"Looked at the Acura RSX, Toyota 
Celica, and Hyundai Tibutron.  The 
Tiburon was quite a value, but build 
quality was noticebly cheaper, and 
resale poor. Celica and RSX were nice, 
but somewhat plain, and the RSX had to 
be revved between 7-8K rpm to get the 
last 40 hp out of the 200 hp engine.

Eclipse is longer and heavier, but 
much more comfortable for front seat 
passengers, especially on longer 
drives.  210 HP is readily available 
at all speeds, and 5 spd manual is 
sporty enough for mountain roads.

So it's not ""fast and furious""  but it 
is sport luxury without having to rev 
like a formula 1 racer."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Jeff S. Ross, 11/25/2002,Enjoy Driving,5,"The acceleration will give you a rush.  
The sportronic 4 speed automatic with 
automatic overdrive is super, plenty of 
get up and go and when used as a 
manual, it is even more fun.  Front 
seating is comfortable and roomy.  
Styling is super, this car will turn 
heads."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,GARY, 12/02/2002,excellent,5,"I AM VERY SATIFIED WITH MY ECLIPSE.I

IN ITS CLASS."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,no0dle, 12/03/2002,GTS - only the best,5,"if your thinking about buyin an 
eclipse, a newer one, go with the gts 
model.  for the extra thousand or two 
its worth the sleek proformance and 
style.  I do a bit of street racing and 
it destroys all the measly civics out 
there. espically at higher speeds, its 
hard for a civic to keep up with this 
145 mph 210hp honda smashin machine! 
great buy"

mitsubishi eclipse.This vechicle not 
only rides and drives well but it makes 
you feel like your in a rocket. It has 
ample power to all wheels and very 
responsive engine with torque. I love 
my car and it will smoke the 
competation such as the toyota celica 
and acura rsx. 4 cylinder sports cars 
just doesnt cut it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,tinoruff, 12/18/2002,GOOD CHOICE,4,"Glad I bought it.  Excellent pick up 
and handles smooth.  I did take it pass 
100 without even knowing it at first.  
Love the leather interior.  My sciatica 
hasn't acted up yet!  The upgraded 
sound system is great.  Can't wait to 
take a long road trip in this titanium 
pearl puppy."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Mikeman1, 12/19/2002,Poorly built,3,"My Eclipse is fun to drive, and a 
pretty good performer, but the build 
quality is extremely low.  I noticed a 
ticking sound in the engine only after 
8,000 miles.  When I pressed the clutch 
in, the ticking goes away.  The dealer 
said this is normal wearing of the 
clutch!  Spoke to Mitshubishi directly, 
and they agreed.  The clutch is 
obviously bad.  They're just waiting 
for the warranty to expire (10,000 
miles) before telling me I need to pay 
for a new clutch.  Trying to get rid of 
this car ASPA.  Creeking, squeeking, 
etc.  Poor build quality.  I was warned 
not to buy a Mitshubishi.  Wish I took 
the advice."

was $2,000 under what the dealership

good so far."

between the RSX and my GT that I got.  
I'm so glad I got the Eclipse GT.  I 
have a 5-speed manual and I love 
opening that door every morning and 
sitting in the drivers seat.  The ride 
is a thrill and the engine roars as 
you take off."

it to anyone, and it is one of the best 
cars I have ever owned."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,rjmorgan, 02/02/2003,Suprised by an eclipse,4,"This was not the first car I drove. I 
used to be an Acura man but the GTS won 
me over. Most of the downfalls of the 
Gt have been addressed in the GTS. 
Better interior materials, slightly 
more horsepower at 210, A cold air 
intake and geared to be more of a 
sports car and an exahst that turns 
heads with it's mean sound."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Heatwrt, 02/19/2003,I LOVE MY GTS,4,"My Eclipse GTS is the best car I have

the persice handling. Everything is 
made so convient the controls to the

from the Eclipse compared to the honda for just a bit 
more money.  I have a AEM cold air intake and a 
Magnaflow exhaust, Upgraded wire kit and wire 
ground kit.  That is all you need to do to these cars to

practice however the rate I was quoted
then got the 2 point hold tacked on
after the contract negotiation. As far
as the vehicle is concerned, the doors
consistently sag I have had them
adjusted 3 times, the service engine
light continually comes on even though I
have it maintained my Mitsu's service
schedule. The vehicle is a horrible
choice considering I've had it 5 months

payed for it. If you are intrigued by
this vehicle think twice. "

The vehicle is a smoother and quieter 
ride but has more muscle than even a 
non turbo 3000GT.  It remains a head 
turner even though some of the girls 
are younger than permissible by law.  
The black leather interior with silver

are the transmission not going into

double clutch it), and some bizarre 
shaking when it is cool/damp and I am 
driving it in 1st gear in the morning. 
Also one time it wouldn't go into gear

I didn't buy this car to race it and my 
driving style is actually pretty 
conservative. Problems I've had in the 
past year: Clutch was completely 
replaced at 14,000 miles at MY expense; 
the sunroof is CRAP, it has a mind of 
its own and will open and close 
depending on its mood; the factory 
tires are CRAP... I had to have mine 
replaced at 12,000 miles because two of 
them had large bubbles in the 
sidewalls; the brakes are crap.  At 
10,000 miles, I had to have the rotors 
turned.

The trim paint on the door is peeling off, the seats are already showing wear, and you can never seem to get used to the clutch. The car always ""lurches"" at take off and it does not shift smoothly at all (maybe cuz its got lots of torque?) It has a few electrical problems, the moonroof has a mind of its own sometimes and reopens by itself after closing it.

After driving the mustang u will know

responsive on turns and doesn't slide 
easily. Drives well in the rain because 
of the front wheel drive. Not as much 
wheel tug as u would think on quick 
acceleration from stop. I would have 
like the mazda rx-8 but this car is the 
best price to car ratio and the monthly 
is not a mortgage payment."

was really impressed. The acceleration

reviews in magazines and I think they 
were far from the truth about this

build-quality issues.  The window seals
don't seal (wet windows after rain,
sometimes moldy smell), there are
unfixable rattles, the mirror motors are
weak, and the sunroof has minor issues
(sticks, control housing comes loose
periodically).  Reliability hasn't been
an isuse at all, it drives very
smoothly, and is very fun to drive.  My
only complaint about the ride is that
the turn radius is horrendus; worse than
the minivan I owned previously!

I'm focusing on the negative, though.  I
love my car, and for the price, there's
nothing I'd rather own.  It's fun,
comfortable, and is one of the
best-looking cars under $30K on the road."

very poor turn radius.  Also, the 
gearing needs revamped.  A lot of 
wasted gears.  I usually just use 1,3 
and 5. That's all that is needed.  Also 
my wife almost killed herself because 
she reached down to the console tray 
for something, and when she pulled back 
and the parking brake got caught on her 
sleeve.  going down the highway at 80 
miles an hour and pulling the brake is 
a recipe for disaster.  After a 360

I have no gripes at all with this car.  It has great acceleration, has great handling and excellent performance.  I enjoy the sun and sound package and the interior midnight blue leather combo looks great.  If you can afford a few extra grand, definitely go for the GTS model.    In my opinion, Eclipses blow Mustangs away; they are much better looking, more reliable and just made with better materials (Mustang is mostly fiberglass).   The only drawback is gas mileage, but we don't buy sports cars for mileage. "

The car now has 53k on it and I have only had to replace the front breaks. No problems since then w/ anything mechanical. But, for essentially a two-seat sports car it could be faster. The seats should also be more supportive and less cushiony.  The suspension is noticable soft/bouncy and feels more like you're in a sedan than a sleek hatchback. It also turns like a Mac truck (40+ ft turning radius!) overstear also becomes a problem w/ more spirited driving. Consider the Acura RSX as well if you are considering a Mitsu. "

I wanted a Celica but couldn't fit in one comfortably. The Eclipse is very comfy and easy on the back for anyone sitting in the front.  Definitely not a 4 seater.  Avoid 4 adult occupancy at all costs.  The acceleration leaves something to be desired but is decent for a 4 cylinder.  For the price I found this to be real good buy, styling and comfort were big for me and this car met those easily.  I don't know why everyone rips on the interior.  I personally like it.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,PTS, 08/08/2005,Mixed bag,3,"I bought mine in 2003.  I was torn between the Eclipse GT and the Acura RSX Type S.  I chose the Eclipse because money was an issue as I was fresh out of college and Mitsubishi was offering zero payments for a year and a lower APR than Acura thereafter.  Plus the RSX was in its first run while this model of Eclipse was in its second.  I figured Mitsubishi would have worked out some kinks by the second generation of that model.  Overall I have been pretty pleased by the performance and mechanical build of the engine and drivetrain.  I have issues however with the shoddy plastic quality of the dash, doors, trunk lining, etc.  The interior is a synch to scratch with keys, luggage & other cargo."

I've owned it for almost 5 trouble-free years now, and have loved it.  It got me up a steeeeeep, winding, thickly-snowed & untreated hill last winter (passing other, struggling cars), and on nice dry days it has plenty of muscle beneath the pedal when I need it (although the torque-steer took some getting used to).  This car is also perfect for short people (like me): the ""butt"" part allows quite a bit of vertical movement, so you can sit much higher than in other sporty cars."

I have wanted one of these vehicles for years, and I am loving it.  Yes, there are terrible blind spots, but not a problem in you use all three of your mirrors and stay aware of the road.  My main complaint is the already mentioned turn radius, which is practically nothing.  I would definitely recommend the V6 GTS.  I drove a 4-cyl. and it had no pickup, with the weight of this car.  My car is totally ""zippy"" and I have had so many compliments on the looks.  I have had absolutely no problems with it, and wouldn't trade it for the world!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Eric, 12/18/2006,"Some Trouble, but Overall Happiness",3,"I love the car - the way it drives and looks, but a few problems are souring me.  Water immediately got in the doors during rain and caused a moldy smell. Now the power windows are failing at 90,000 miles. The A/C went out at 80,000 miles.  The brakes are of moderate quality and durability.  The window tint started peeling within 50,000 miles.  The hatchback is tough to open and won't stay up in cold weather.  The interior poorly designed - I reach too far for many things.  The plastic interior takes a beating.  The plastic hooks for the floor mats break easily.  Also, the blind spot is a major issue and the A/C (when working) saps much engine power.  On small bumps, I bottom out the nose.  But man, at 60 mph, the acceleration is great."

I got the car used from a dealed about 7 years ago and put 90k miles of my own for a total of 150k (actual mileage). I gave all it maintenance and regular oil changes. The engine is not as strong as I would like to. I had to reapir it and change multiple valves, gaskets and resolve loss of pressure inside the engine. I live in CA and the smog regulations are strict here I had to get rid off the car for not passing the smog check because the catalytic converter worth more than the car itself.

It has a lot of road noise, huge blind spots (but that is to be expected on any sports car) and a turn radius so bad you have to drive it to believe it. Interior is plastic, but stylish. The back seat is merely for looks, but you shouldn't have a problem selecting takers for the front seat (everyone wants to ride in it). It is very reliable, no mechanical problems, although I would highly recommend better grounding wires since Mitsubishi stock grounds are suspect at best.

It's the best used fwd sports car you can get for the money.  It's a good looking car, great features, lots of cargo space, great gas mileage, plenty of power, comfortable seats, and great sounding stereo. There are only a few negatives. I had one blow out on the highway and then an air leakage, and the tires probably had another 10,000 miles left on them.  Another issue is how low the car sits.  Be prepared to ruin your bumper going into bad parking lots, and it has a horrible turning radius."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2003,Nate, 01/12/2016,Worst mistake I ever made.,1,"Bought this car for $4,000 in 2012, with 80,000 miles on it. I must have got a bad one. I had to replace coil packs shortly after buying it, and a main bearing in the engine went out as I was driving down the interstate and it began knocking. I barely got it home. Had to replace the engine, clutch, motor mounts, hoses, plugs, wires, coil packs, control arms, drive shaft, and a few other things by 102,000 miles. Then shortly after, the transmission had a bearing go out, and had to replace the tranny, alternator, and tierods by 112,000 miles. Had a few misc. issues, the hatch supports that hold the trunk lost pressure and had to be replaced, the seatbelt dinger stopped working, check engine light came on, starter became weak, headlights fell apart and had to be replaced (couldn't see more than 15 feet in front of my car), and for some reason the passenger side headlamp would burn out every 2 months. The front turn signals had to be replaced because they got water in them and corroded the socket, causing the turn signals to malfunction. This car just seemed like it was one problem after the next, and I lost my rear end on this car when I finally sold it, with 125,000 miles. I also noticed that the car had a weird shift link up. The engine would drop its RPM almost immediately after pushing the clutch to shift, then would jerk when letting it out after getting the car in gear. When starting out, it would vibrate really bad when letting the clutch out. The steering would pull to the left, unless I got on it, which would cause it to go straight, until I let up on the gas. The car was not equipped with ABS, and was incredibly dangerous to drive in snow. One inch would cause it to fishtail from behind, unless I pumped the breaks, which was difficult in some situations.

I never had any issues with it within those miles. Finally blew a gasket after 300,000 miles due to a water pump leak I didn't know about (more behind that reason) and had to get rid of it as it was unbelievably expensive to repair. This car will last a lifetime if you take care of it, I guarantee it.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2004,Andi82, 06/08/2008,Fun Car,3,I love to drive my car but it is having an issue and the dealer does not know what's wrong because there are not codes.

Despite the fact that I have been hit 3 times, even when the damage was extensive, I walked away. The current one may be totaled, in which case I will go on to a newer model, but my experience with this car leaves me no doubts about it's safety - just the invisible ""hit me"" sign which appears to come with the ones I've bought. AND, the mileage has been terrific. I avg 27 back & forth to work, and up to 40 on the highway! I LOVE this car! "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2004,Dave, 06/10/2016,"Used to love, now I hate",2,"I bought my 2004 Eclipse GT (5 speed Manual) brand new from the Dealership in April, 2014.  It had 6 miles on it when I test drove, 18 miles at sale.  Everything was great about it at first and it is still fun to drive, but the honeymoon is long since passed.

I had owned it for less than 1 year when the air hose came unclamped causing debris to get into the intake manifold and the check engine light came on.  I had to fight with the dealership to get it covered under warranty.  When they finally relented, they said that my warranty was voided due to an issue with the title.  So my manufacturer warranty never paid for a dime of anything that ever went wrong with the car.  It would turn out to not cover many other things.

After I had owned the car for 5 years (fall, 2009) there was a heavy rain.  A large amount of water got into the floor on the passenger side.  Conveniently, the amplifier for the stock stereo system sits under the passenger seat and was destroyed by the rain.  I had to disconnect the battery and remove the media fuse as it was making loud crackling through the speaker system despite the car being off.  Again, not covered under warranty and so I have lived without a radio for almost 7 years now.  The car still gets water in it during heavy rain so I have to park under cover whenever I can.

Around the same time, in 2008 or 2009, since the car is black, the paint began to peel off.  Most of the car now is primer gray, with a large amount of rust on the roof of the vehicle.  There was eventually a recall and if your car was covered under warranty, they would repaint it for free.  Since I had no warranty, I got an offer for about $130 to repaint which obviously was insufficient.  I never bothered to get the paint fixed since remediating the rust first was going to be expensive.  So my car is a giant eye-sore now.

Not long after that, I believe in 2011 or so, the check engine light came on for oxygen sensors and also for misfiring.  Apparently the electronic distributor had gone bad and needed to be replaced.  It had to be replaced again in 2015.  No warranty, big expense. 

Also in 2011, the heater started to quit working.  I paid over $3000 between a dealership and two other shops and they never could fix the issue.  The thermostat was replaced twice and a valve switch in the heater core was replaced.  It turned out that there was a lose solder joint in the electronics in the dash that needed to be redone, but I found and fixed that myself after the fact.  Never had an issue with the heat after that point.  I can't believe that they couldn't find that after $3000 of unnecessary repairs.  But driving in the winter without defrost is not an option, so I was forced to pay it.

In 2014, I think, my timing belt had failed while I was driving and needed replacement.  I had less than 80,000 miles on the car at the time (I was in the military and in college during the first 7 years I owned the car so I didn't accumulate many miles) but again, no warranty so I had to eat the cost.  The mechanic said I was lucky that the engine didn't throw a rod and destroy the car as I was on the freeway at 60 mph when it happened (I lost power and had to be pushed to the side of the freeway by a police officer).

For me, this car has been nothing but trouble.  I still love to drive it and it still runs great.  Although it has never handled well in rain or snow, the brakes lock up extremely easily (I thought it had anti-lock brakes but apparently it doesn't?) in even the smallest amounts of rain.  The MPG has always been terrible, even on long road trips on the highway.  In the city it barely makes 270 miles per tank and on the highway it's rarely above 350.  Since it requires premium fuel, it's an expensive car to keep fueled up.  But the car accelerates well, corners well, and has a great sound to it.  I just wish everything else about
 the car wasn't so cheap.

I will never buy another Mitsubishi again, that's for sure.

Just to remind buyers to be wary of this potential problem with the Eclipse as the condenser is poorly protected."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2004,moonbeem, 03/05/2009,Would never buy again,3,"Wheel base is poor compared to my Celica. I thought buying a 6 cylinder car would increase my power speed at take off, but my 4 cylinder Celica had much better power.

I love the car, I have it in Black.  I 
would definetly recommend the sun & 
sound package, it features an upgraded 
sound system (7-speaker infinity setup 
w/ 210 watts) and a sunroof.  I've 
rated comfort as the lowest because 
getting in and out can be a pain after 
a long day, and while wearing a coat 
it's a battle just to get the seatbelt 
on (although that prevails in most 
cars, not a big deal)  The styling is 
distinct on the car, alot of people put 
body kits on their cars, but in my 
eyes - mitsubishi did a great enough

mitsubishi,eclipse,2005,Drek Digital, 10/15/2015,Not So Fast Yet Furious,4,"""I bought this car 2yrs ago at 138,000 miles on it and the car already had a few mods. It had an AEM Cold Air Intake, Headers, & Performance Exhaust. It also had an ECU tune and that's important because with the ""sportstronic"" gearbox which has the manual mode, I am able to red line it without the car shifting for me before redline. 1st and 2nd gear pulls are definitely the strongest while 3rd and 4th gear pulls are typically weak. My 0-60 time is anywhere between 7.0 - 6.8 seconds which is pretty good for the price I paid for this car. You cannot find a turbo or supercharger for this car easily but if you are satisfied with bolt-ons you can expect to get a few gains outta this 3.0L. The most reliable car I ever had as I've only had to change the fuel pump since I got it. However be careful for engines that have the dreadful ""lifter ticks"" as it can get louder over time and become an expensive fix.""

mitsubishi,eclipse,2005,Chinpaint, 07/17/2010,Bad Paint Job,4,"Overall the car is a good car. It looks good and handles good. I have had no problems with either the engine or drive train. My three negatives, one because of space available between the seat, roof and steering wheel it can be a little difficult for driver to enter. Second engineering design has turn signal blocked by steering wheel.(move light or change steering wheel design). Last this summer two bad paint spots appeared. One between sun roof and back window, the second between trunk and rear window. "

The car extremey fun to drive and not something that becomes burdensome after a short while. The leather seating is comfortable, and the interior is roomy enough for the driver and passenger. I don't consider this car a true ""Sports Car"" by definition, but I would call it a ""Sporty"" vehicle. It has enough power and torque to get you where you're going as fast as you want, but don't expect to race your neighbor's flashy Nissan 350Z. Mitsubishi has definately upped their build quality since the '90's. This Eclipse feels solid and is extremely reliable. The clutch on the 5-speed models is very forgiving and easy to drive."

I've had it now over two years and I love it.  I still smile every time I see it in the driveway.  It runs great and is very fun to drive.  My only complaint is that shortly after I bought it, I bumped into a pole (too low to see at my son's baseball field) and it creased the bumper.  I thought for a hit that light, it should have not shown any damage but it did. So I think the body is not very forgiving.  Still wouldn't want anything else, it's a fun car."

I am very happy and feel like a kid again."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2005,lisa, 03/25/2005,Remix edition,4,"This is my 2nd Eclipse and is the Remix Edition. Eclipses handle very well, are quick, reliable and fun to drive. Drove the first one 150K+ miles/9 years. It never left me stranded.  The 2005 seems even better built and the warranty is excellent.  The remix edition came with a great option package for the money. Anyone buying an Eclipse won't be disappointed. For a female driver it is a perfect comfort fit size wise. The interior seems to be better put together than the previous body style was. Buyers should understand that with any Eclipse, they will have to handle the scheduled maintenance/parts replacement tasks very responsibly or the car definitely lets you know its time."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2005,Dtone, 03/28/2005,Sheep in Wolve's Clothing,4,"Had a Galant for two years. Traded it in for the Eclipse. Has the same 2.4l engine as the Galant. Comfortable seats, good gas milage, pleasant handling characteristics, surprising amount of cargo space with the rear seats folded down. Looks sporty, but is more a 'Mom and Pop' 2-door coupe. Sensible 'Midlife chrisis' car for relatively short money."

I find it hard to see what is around me though, whether I am trying to change lanes or back out of a parking space. I also have found the stereo system to be one of the worst I have owned in a car. For the price, a better system would have been expected."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,garyf2132, 01/12/2015,Wicked Awesome Eclipse,4,"I purchased a 2006 Eclipse GS Automatic with only 60,000 miles on it just last week. It came equipped with the Rockford Fosgate premium stereo system with subwoofer. I'm in love with this car literally. It's a real head turner. Acceleration is fantastic especially when pulling onto the highway or changing lanes, plenty of power to zoom around. The blue colored dash lights are a wicked cool feature. The bucket seats give it that extra sporty feel. The stereo system doesn't come with an AUX input jack unfortunately but I purchased an OEM Mitsubishi cable online so I will install it myself into the rear of the stereo system. Overall I love this car & wouldn't trade it for anything."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,joey45, 03/23/2012,Overall A Good Buy,4,"This is a fun car to drive and a headturner for sure. I have 62K on the car and have had virtually no problems except one big problem.

My breaks became spongy after 50K. Since it was past the 5 year warrenty I had to pay for the repairs myself. Bleeding the breaks worked for a few months, then the problem came back. Next, it was thought to be the master cylinder, that was replaced and then the problem came back after a few months. Now all thats left is the booster, which may be faulty. So overall this problem is going to end up costing me over $800.

Also outside trim/molding for this car is HORRBle. It was worn out after only 6 1/2 years. Cost to fix? $925"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Decseh, 05/17/2008,GT Auto,4,"Hot looking car, very fun to drive.  Car is hungry to go fast all the time.  The 5 speed auto with sportshift is fun to drive, if you leave it in auto mode it shifts fast to provide better speed/acceleration.  Awesome sound system.  Nice leather interior.  Great for someone who just rides themselves or maybe one other person.  For 263 hp the cars gas mileage isn't too bad.  I drive mostly city and I'm getting about 16-17 mpg and probably about 25 on the highway.  That's driving with a lead foot too.  I don't want to get rid of this car because there's not another car on the market that compares to it.  Goes great in the winter as well with the FWD system."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,TB Hart, 10/09/2008,Pure Passion,4,"The exterior style of this vehicle is a stopper, inch for inch, its sleek and impressive lines has on more than I care to count explicit compliments from ladies and strangers on the street.  The performance of this machine is so fantastic.  When one needs power, there is more than one could hope for in a smaller vehicle.  I have an automatic and can burn rubber when I punch it at 25 miles per hour.  One minor downside is its blind spot, but the mirrors are well designed to compensate.  When one sits in this car and turns on the dynamic sound system, one feels as if one is truly ""one"" with the vehicle.  I love driving  on winding, country roads..this baby hugs the pavement."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jayme, 02/16/2009,Dependability,4,"This was the 1st 2006 sold in the Middle TN area and my 2nd Eclipse. I now have 57,000 miles and is still going strong. The original brakes squealed and had to replace with ceramic brakes. It is extremely quick and fun to drive. The sound system is top notch but the display could be a little more sophisticated.  The original tires have lasted 57,000 miles and just now need to be replaced. If only the resale value was better."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,ink, 06/17/2008,I love this car!,5,"I bought this car in 2006 straight off the truck (literally). I'm one of about 5 people in a 50 mile radius that even owns a 4G Eclipse, there is no torque steer if you don't floor it from a dead stop. Handling issues are pretty much B.S., I took a turn going 60 mph with no problems haha, and I can go through curves at 75 mph, so whatever. Noisey exhaust? haha it's an import - hello!!!! "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,TxFemme, 01/14/2010,Awesome Compromise,4,"I bought my Eclipse used with 17K miles on it. I now have 29K and it has not so much as hiccuped. It's powerful, fun to drive, and I get compliments almost daily. The RF system is AWESOME, best stock system I've ever owned (and there have been many). It's a relatively comfortable ride for a sports car and I've taken it on several long road trips. The backseat is best suited for those under 5'4"" but at least it has one. The curb weight gives the car a substantial, safe feel. The stock tires are not as sticky as I'd like in slippery conditions. Probably the main negative point for me is the turning radius. Also, the powerful engine combined with FWD equals major torque steer at times."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,tombrater, 08/17/2011,Amazing!,4,"Okay...I have only had this car for a week. I bought it used with 55k miles. I will update this if I run into any problems, but I am confident that I won't have to. The car looks sweet and turns heads. I took the Eclipse lettering off of the back to create an extra clean look. It is extremely powerful and responsive with acceleration and handling thanks to the 6 speed manual transmission. The RF sound system is one of the best systems I have heard. The car feels sturdy too. No rattles out of the hatchback or anywhere for that matter. The blue instrumental lighting is nice too. As for the person that paid $300 per tire, I found good year 18in tires for $140, and that was brand new."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,randmanx, 01/06/2009,One Sleeper Of A Car,4,"I bought the car used for 14k. I wouldn't pay the price for it new as it's a loaded gt v6, but it's a solid choice for the price. It's very quick and puts a grin on my face every time I mash the accelerator! I had a 98 gsx that was totaled by a deer in December and never thought another car could top that one. But I'm sold, the 06 gt is way nicer."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jeremy, 01/19/2009,Explore other options,3,"I bought this car new and recently my car was tied up at a dealership for 4.5 mo. for an input shaft bearing that failed, ruining my input shaft seal, clutch and burned my flywheel. NONE WAS COVERED UNDER THE 10yr/100,000mile powertrain warranty you are supposed to get with the vehicle! The interior is easily marked, scratched. Cheap materials on panels and dash. Gauges are accurate, suspension is ok, I've driven better, and worse for stock. Wheel well gap looks a little funny unless you lower the car or larger rims. I would advise looking at other options or be aware of possible bills with this car. hope this helps."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Amanda, 10/28/2006,I love this Car!,4,I got my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse in January of this year and I love the way it handles on the road.  I also love the pick up on the highways.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,APB, 01/28/2007,2006 Eclipse GT,4,"This is my third Eclipse GT.  The additional horsepower and torque are a welcome addition.  The change to a sensor instead of manual throttle linkage spoils the driver's input on the manual transmission version.  When the variable timing will kick in, becomes a guessing game and can have some unpredictable results.  The lower first gear combined with 50-60 extra pounds of torque makes for a quick start, but during rush hour traffic, this is more of a hazard.  Add bigger brakes for the extra weight.  All of the new features related to computerization and sensors are probably better suited to the automatic transmission.  They interfere with those of us that actually want to drive the car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Erik, 07/25/2007,Quite a decent car,4,"The new Mitsubishi Eclipse is a hit. The four cylinder loves to rev, has adequate performance. I have 15k on the car on everything is great on it. Everybody loves my car. People think it is nice. The quality of the interior is fairly good. The optional Rockford Fosgate system booms with sound. The ride is comfortable. The steering is nicely weighted. But I hope you don't plan on using that back seat. Only children or small toddlers can tolerate it. I'm over six foot, trust me, you'll go nuts in the back seat. When it comes to cargo time, this car ain't too bad. I hauled a new boxed computer in it and monitor and it fit just right. The car in my opinion is a car that is a looker."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ømar Chafee, 03/31/2015,Amazing Car.,4,"I had a dark red 06 Eclipse GT with that ""rare"" black strip going down the front bumper. It was a beautiful car I bought a nice spoiler for it too. It really drove great, I had it from 75 K miles to 115 K miles until it was hit by a drunk driver, totaling it. It gave me small minor problems throughout the time I've had it but that's almost what's to expect from any used car near or over 100 K. My car door sometimes wouldn't close, I had to get it a new battery because the battery I had was very weak.. ect. The sound quality is absolutely magnificent. That speaker in the trunk really gives the overall sound an extra punch. Acceleration is great. I liked nearly everything about this car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,RICH J, 12/10/2019,2006 ECLIPSE ....YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!,1,"MY 2006 eclipse gt with the 263 horsepower v6 was one of the fastest cars you could buy back then, and it turned heads and got compliments every joyride in titanium gray. Unfortunately over a few years it became the worst car I ever owned. There is a known problem with the dash cover peeling away and this cannot be fixed, when it happens its ugly and takes away from how you feel about the entire car and its embarrassing. Interior plastic is very cheap and door handles and both the traction control and foglight buttons broke and fell into the housing. Then 2 seperate catalytic converter failures, I sold mine for parts. Enjoy yours while you can."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,alex195, 06/16/2014,eclipse gt,4,"Ive had my eclipse for 3 months now and it's been a bast to drive! Bought it used with 130 000km on it. Painted the front center black, fake diffuser black to make it look real, and the roof too, and put ralliart badges on. Had no problems with the engine, however... the cheap sh*t door handles did break and even the new ones make that bending plastic quealing noise, the cheap plastic key also broke, and so did the cheap plastic a/c control. But that's why it costs so little, you do get a great 3.8L v6 that could use a little more power if your used to driving high hp vehicles, but if your not its more then enough. It always pulls in any gear with no hesitation but road noise is horrendous!!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ronnie and Clyde, 09/12/2006,Very Fast Car,5,"Do not down shift at 80 mph from 6th to 3rd gear and expect the clutch to last, from a technician's perspective.

The fuel injection wasn't working correctly.  At first I though that the warranty would cover the problem, but it ended being caused by a bad tank of fuel. It caused a lot of damage to different parts of the car.  It shows the car is not reliable at all. And when I talked with a Mitsubishi rep. she said that the car needs to run a middle grade fuel or premium fuel, otherwise it will have problems again in the future and not be covered by the warranty."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,DrWankel, 10/22/2008,So So of a car,3,"Bought the new gen GT with sun & sound pkg when it first came out and was enjoying it for awhile till just after 2 months the front brake rotors warped.  Brought it in to the dealer and after threats I got the rotors warrantied. 2 months later again warped, replaced with aftermarket never again had a problem.  The Radio? what's up with the display? my girl's saturn has a much better read out, I mean top of the line fact Rockford come on, bad design. NOT EVEN AN IPOD JACK (dealer offers an ipod setup for a cheap $230?!)  For a car with its decent performance, the fact tires suck in every way I had to upgrade those too! Overall not impressed, I would never ever buy another."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,The Jaje, 06/15/2005,Sweet Car,4,"After reading the Edmunds review on this car, I had to see for myself, so i went to the dealership (after playing phone tag with the salesman) and they had two on the lot... an Orange and a Silver.  Well, thats that, I drove out of the dealership an hour later in a brand new Orange Eclipse on May 28th.  It has been a dream come true.  It's incredibly fast, but the ride is so comfortable that you hardly notice any roughness in the road.  A real step up from my last car ('95 Lumina).  I think I am in love with it, it's just a very well built car which is incredbly fun to drive.  Go out and test one for yourslef, you will feel like i did. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Lauren Bell, 08/19/2006,Stay Away from all Mitsubishi products,1,"This vehicle completely lacks any sort of quality and Mitsubishi is not standing behind their product.  The problems we have had with the vehicle include: 1. All four brake rotors warping by 9,000 miles, had to be resurfaced, now the brakes grind and squeak 2. The car has three rattles. We understand this doesn't affect the operation of the vehicle but it is disheartening to spend so much money and hate to drive your vehicle so much. 3. Paint chipping off and fading, all over the car. Mitsubishi says we got behind a rock truck, two body shops say the paint job is cheap and defective. 4. Two brake recalls, both of which could cause a crash. We were only notified by taking the car in for an oil change."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Puglove, 06/21/2009,Can't wait to sell it,3,I bought my Eclipse new and the second week I had a tick in the engine and my exhaust rattled.  The dealer had no explanation for the tick except to change the oil...did nothing.  My CD changer went out in year 3.  The air conditioning controls also went out...the fan works but no cold air except for #1 on the dial. I now also have some loud rubbing noise coming from the back end.  When driving it sounds like something is open as you hear all road noises.  When it rains something in the hatch leaks.  The gas mileage is good however and this car has pep even with the air on (if the air works that is).  This is my first foreign car and will be my last. Mits has made me frown on foreign.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,4gen eclipse, 07/03/2005,Another Disappointment on the 4th Generation Eclipse,2,"The performance is alright, not as good as advertised of course.  This car is not comfortable and gets terrible gas mileage with its 3.8L engine. if attention-getting is considered fun, then I suppose driving this uncomfortable 4th generation Eclipse is somewhat ~fun~.   This car has tire-chirp, understeer, small rear window (no wiper), blind-spots. The build-quality is just like every other Mitsubishi, poor.  I have so much regret for wasting time on waiting for this disappointment. I should've gone with either an Infiniti G35 Coupe, or an Acura RSX-S."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Moe, 07/17/2006,Hot Car...Equals Hot Chicks!,4,"The '06 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a great car, I just picked her up on Friday (7/14). It's been nothing but fun.  I get great compliments from random people.  The car is really quick.  Also, it's an official chick magnet.  If you want to be the guy/girl that wants to stand out on the road, this is the way to go!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Miguel , 07/16/2005,Naaa,2,"This car is a new model yes, but don't let the looks fool you. I rather perfer the '99 model, in all ways except for the stereo system, but as of now with all new cars, the stereo systems are at their supreme sound quality."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Tim Harrison, 12/19/2005,Horrible Car,1,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT couldn't be any uglier or cheaply made!  Mitsubishi has out done itself again by creating an even uglier car than the last.  I bought this car for my wife and it has to be a sign of the end for Mitsubishi.  We have had problem after problem with it.  The interior is a step up from a Dodge Neon, good luck with this junk."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ryan, 12/10/2005,I love this car!,5,"I have had my Eclipse for about five months now. I really enjoy this car! Once the 4 banger is broken in it really wakes up and has no problem leaving rubber! It drives very smoothly with very little body role. It allso has a remarkable stereo! The bass can shake the car next to you! Every time I look at the car it looks sleeker and more sexy. I sugest you go look at one up close and soak up the car from all angles and you will see what I mean.  Pictures do not do this car justice, you need to see it up close."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,sexie 06, 04/11/2006,Awesome Eclipse,4,"This is my 3rd Mitsubishi Eclipse in 10 years, and it is by far the best one I have ever owned. The design is on the money. It is HOT!  It is sporty, sleek, and just glides on the road.  It also is easy to handle (and easy to get a ticket in if you aren't careful).  I just tinted the windows and had a set of 'hook up' rims on it.  The Eclipse has always been my favorite car.  It is comfortable to ride in.  I would recommend to any single lady or guy (it is a great pick-up car)."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Kevin Perkins, 06/03/2005,Excellent,4,The car handles beutifully and is very powerful. The accelleration is overwhelming and it looks phenominal. I have had this car for two months and notice a difference from my last car. 
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,c130crewchief79, 09/29/2006,"Transmission Problems at 4,200 Miles",3,"OK, I love the car's design and it's fun to drive, but I got the manual transmission for the fun of the drive.  I know how to drive a stick as I grew up doing so.  At 4,200 miles my clutch decided to go out along with all the components associated.  Mitsubishi decided that it was aparrently my fault, not that it might be the design (which I had a Nascar tech tell me was going to be a problem three days after I got it, during an interview for school).  Anyway I forked out almost $1,000 and that's after I got a price break because I knew a maintenace person at the dealer.  Any way they fixed it.  Two days later it was back in the shop.  The flywheel was making a loud noise and in neutral my clutch is burning.  I rate the transmission pack a 2."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Chanel, 03/12/2007,My Eleventh Mitsubishi Eclipse,5,"Of all the previous Eclipses I have owned, my '99 Spyder GST was always my favorite, until now. The '06 Eclipse GT drives like a dream. I have it in Liquid Silver (I should have bought black).  I am thinking about having it painted Northstar White (the color of my '99 Spyder).  I have received more compliments with this car than any other. My vehicle has dealer dark tint, and Mitsubishi sport pinstriping included. So Hot! The iPod in the glove box is HOT! This car has style, is sleek, and five of my friends purchased one within a week of me purchasing mine. This is my second 2006 Eclipse and I love them.  BUY ONE!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,royce, 03/30/2007,Fun to Drive,4, I have thoroghly enjoyed this car my only problems have been the SRS system in the passenger seat. The car safety features are the most appealing. I was driving home from Cleveland when an ice/snow mix started  falling. A vehicle spun out in front of me and I applied the brakes. That along with the traction control prevented a major accident.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Alex, 04/02/2008,Eclipse Machoman,4,I am sales representative for computer products in Puerto Rico and my GT 2006 has 98000 miles without any problems.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,azkid, 06/01/2008,Stunning Car,4,"This is an extremely beautiful car. This would be my first car and i am very surprised by what this car has to offer. Sure the back seat is practically useless, but hey, it's a sports coupe! Go get a sedan if you're looking to haul around family and friends. This car gives pretty decent mileage and the turning radius is not as bad as everyone claims it to be. This car is an amazing value. Lots to offer for the price. The Gt has PLENTY of power and the sportronic  transmission works very smoothly. Also, interior is stunning at night time. Wouldn't want any other car for a first car than the eclipse."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Misty P. Toole, 07/26/2008,Tire Wear,4,"I really love this car! I am on my second Eclipse-just love the RF music system, and the way you just want to drive this car constantly!  The downside of the 2006 Eclipse GT is that the tires need to be replaced much too soon in comparison to other ""Low Pro"" enhanced vehicles.What ever happened to 36,000 miles for tire life expectancy? I have 11,000 miles on my car, and at $309 per tire? I hope that the new Chevy Camaro is out for my next purchase!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,tif, 06/10/2005,My dream car!!,4,"I absolutly love my new 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse. It is a very fun car to drive. My teenage years I drempt about driving on a back road going with the wind in my Eclipse and now it has come true! I absolutly love Mitsubushi and I would recomend it to anyone who wants a sporty yet confortable car It was the best investment I've made so far in my life and im only 21.  I thank Mitsubishi for making my dream come true by making such wonderful cars. Thank you, A very happy owner."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,diana, 06/27/2005,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse,5,"I bought this car for my daughter, and it is the best car.  It is a real beauty we are very happy to have this 2006. We are getting lots of compliments on it.  We traded in a 2003 spyder it was great too."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,MEL, 07/07/2005,Great car for the money,4,"This car is a head turner, fun to drive, has a great sound system, front seats roomy but back seat has no leg room and good trunk room. The GS is peepy for a 4 cylinder, does corners well."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,ny, 07/08/2005,12 year Mitsubishi driver,4,"The Eclipse is fun to drive.  Take a while to get used to the wide interior, dash, hood.  GT excellent choice for the price difference.  I bought it even with GM employee program available on other cars."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jennifer, 08/14/2005,Great Car,4,"I purchased this car a few weeks ago, and my only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. This is the first new car I have ever purchased and it has been great. I am a designer, so having a car that is well designed was very important to me. I get compliments all the time. I have the sunset pearl color so it stands out among the other sports cars. For a 4-cylinder engine, it drives very well. Living in a big city you need to be able to zip in and out of traffic, and this car is perfect for that if you are on a budget. But I had a hard time finding it. I traveled about 300 miles to go pick it up. Great car and I highly recommend it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Zabian, 08/25/2005,Sweet Ride,4,"I have only had the vehicle for a week, but I LOVE IT.  I owned a 2000 GT and the new style and engine is by far a vast improvement."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,averyjenn, 08/31/2005,Love this car!,4,The body style says it all.  This car is fun to drive!  I got the sport and accessory package and couldn't be happier.  One drive of this car and it was like it was meant for me - the seat just cradles you.  Great on long drives.  
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Bob MacMillan, 08/31/2005,Great Car,4,"I wanted a front wheel drive car -- I live in New England and this is my only car.  Had a Saab which I enjoyed but this car is much much tighter and more fun to drive.  Excellent power, engine sounds terrific, I feel like if I need to ""go"" into traffic, I can GO! After I read the review in early July in USA Today I was sold."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Mitch from DC, 09/21/2005,"Better Looks, Better Performance",4,"My new 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS has been great. With its new interior and exterior design, it causes people to ask about it and forces many stares. Pros would have to be that at least the front of the car is comfortable, but the back could use some more space. The Rockford Fosgate stereo with the 6-CD changer is a must. Other than a big turning radius everything else has been fine. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Mike, 09/27/2005,"Best Sports Coupe Around for $23,500",4,"I originally was looking to buy a Scion tC or Acura RSX until I went and saw the new 2006 Eclipse.  The new body style looks GREAT.  It looks more like how the old ones used to look.  The interior is nothing but stellar.  With a 162HP, it moves around pretty quickly...I'd say 0-60 in about 6.5 to 7.0 seconds.  The Independent suspension makes cornering childs-play even at high speeds!  The fact that it comes standard with side impact airbags, in addition to side curtain and front air bags is a big plus!  If you're into music, you won't be disapointed with some lame stereo system.  I have been rather impressed with the 650- watt Rockford Fosgate audio system with nine speakers and a 10-inch subwoofer.  A+++++++"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Chris, 10/30/2005,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse,5,This vehicle gets everyone's attention.  I'm stopped all the time and even asked if they can photograph my Eclipse because it's so sporty and appealing.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Adam , 10/31/2005,WOW!,4,"For the price, the 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT is the best car out there.  It has an awesome warranty, looks at least $10,000 expensive more than it is.  A dude at the gas station looked shocked when he asked about the price and I said that I got it for around $20,000. This car is nice and fast. It is one of the best looking cars out on the road.  It provides great comfort for front passengers, but the rear seats are just for show (that's why it's not a 10). It has a good sized trunk for lugging around my hockey equipment.  Mine is the awesome new color of pearlescent orange (think metallic orange that looks red at night and bright orange in sunlight)"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Very Hot Car, 11/09/2005,Powerful,4,The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT is at the top of it's class. it is great looking inside and out and has awesome power. I would put this car up against most other cars on the road today. it is extremely quick off the line and has smooth on the highway. It handles great. Did I mention the power? This is the perfect sports car. I had a BMW 328 Coupe before this car and by far the 2006 Eclipse is better and faster. I highly recommend it.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Marybeth, 12/10/2005,Car of my dreams...,4,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT is an absolute dream to drive.  It is fast and responsive.  It handles like a  race car.  You bearly realize the change from 80 to 100 mph. Curvy country roads become a challenge - how fast can YOU do them at? It drives well on slick or icy roads, too.  The traction control keeps it in line. The most fun part is that it is the first car I've ever owned that actually stops traffic.  People stop to look at it.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,pcmodem, 01/10/2006,"Minor Issues, but Still Amazingly Fun",5,"Everywhere I go, people ask about my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT, but that's not the only reason I bought it.  It's fast, more reliable in bad weather due to its FWD, large enough to actually fit people in the back (although not large people), and comes with a 100,000 mile warranty.  My only complaints would be some minor cosmetic defects that the dealer promptly fixed, and a lack of a comfortable place to put my left elbow while driving."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,tomickey, 01/23/2006,I Love My Eclipse,5,"I had my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS for about three months now and I love it! Every time I look at it I just have to smile. The drive is tight and it just cruises down the road. I couldn't ask for a better ride. I wasn't looking to buy a car right now, but when I saw the '06 Eclipse I just had to get it. Everyone one in my family wants to try and steal it. People stop me all the time to say ""Nice Car!"" people call it my Porshe but cheaper.  The interior is nice and who cares about the back seat it's just me and my car. The radio system is nice even for the basic model.  The visability is fine, that is something I expected in a sports car  I had a hard time finding my car in a 5-speed and blue."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Blue06Eclipse, 01/24/2006,Nice Machine,4,"Well It's been six months now, and my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse still continues to amaze me.  It gets looks everywhere, and compliments like you wouldn't believe.  I love just driving it to work, it's so comfortable.  it is a n nice redesign compared to the 2001 model that I had previously. It really is an amazing difference."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,300c_kid, 02/06/2006,FUN FUN FUN!!!,4,"I love my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT!  What a FUN car!  I traded in my old Eclipse for the new one.  I love the engine and way it sounds.  The manual transmission is a joy.  The suspension handles excellently and absorbs bumps.  The car is finished immaculately inside and out.  Mitsubishi used great materials.  I recommend it to all my friends.  It feels like such a much more expensive car!  It should have AWD, but one gets used to the FWD configuration.  Its gas mileage is pretty good.  I got the V6 with a manual transmission and am getting around 20 mpg driving it hard!  I love the sound of the engine...I hardly ever turn on the radio.  I have no complaints at all.  I am estremely happy with my Eclipse!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,D. Sun, 03/14/2006,No Brainer,5,"I was in the process of purchasing a Chevy Cobalt when I saw the new Eclipse at the auto show.  Mitsubishi saved me from a costly mistake.  While driving the vehicle, can't believe what you get for the price.  The amenities, including the amazing 650 watt sound system, are incredible.  Its ride is smooth and comfortable, allowing for enjoyable long trips.  The design is amazing, it definitely catches the attention of others when sitting at a light."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ryan, 04/09/2006,New Eclipse Owner,4,"L\I looked at the competitors, but when all was said and done, the styling, features and just the sheer driving experience in the 6-speed manual GT won me over.  The RX-8's reliablity (or lack of) in winter and constant addition of a quart of oil every 1,500 miles in the rotarty engine was a turn off.  The fact the Z didn't have a back seat to tote toys back and forth and the styling wasn't as aggressive as the Eclipse was a deciding factor. Plus teh Z was too cookie cutter in looks.  Just for the heck of it, looked at the Scion tC, but it's nothing more then a Toyota Corolla, although great price, really a sub-compact.  The Eclipse's stying and features made me a first time Mitsu buyer, and one for life."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Michele, FL,MANY improvements!,4,"I have been driving Mitsubishi cars since 1994.  Most of those years I have driven the Eclipse. (2004 I had the Outlander XLT, nice SUV!  But I did not like how an SUV is blown around on the highway by winds).  I have NEVER had an engine problem with any of my Mistsubishis, but did have problems with the quality of the bodies (only in the Eclipse) and loose handeling.  This year's model has MANY improvements from those in the past!  It has MANY more saftey features, like WINDOW airbags, as well as front and side airbags.  This year's body feels much more secure on the road, it is MUCH tighter.  The body is of a higher quality also.  It also has much more of a ""sports car"" feel and look. I have to say I love the car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,mecks one, 06/01/2006,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS,3,"The 4-cyl. version of this car isn't so bad, but it does have its problems. The fuel economy for one is garbage and I don't know when it will get to the actually mpg the sticker states.  The exterior of course is great and unique.  The engine is noisy when up to about 3,500 rpm and then worse when shifting.  I need to change the exhaust and the intake to atleast make the sound somewhat better.  The brakes already scream and this was at about 2,000 miles.  The fwd on this car may cause the steering to stick if you punch too hard on a turn.  Also, it is hard to start at times.  In all honesty this is a great car and with a few mods (which they need to come out with faster) things should be great.."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Kina k, 07/04/2006,Love this car!,4,"I bought the '06 6 speed Eclipse GT, and this car can move! I really like the fact that the car can accelerate to a high rate of speed so quickly. I have the aero kit, and it sets the car apart from the others out there, all of the ones I've seen did not have the kit. The Eclipse is a lot of car for the money. It is a better value than Nissan's Z; it is faster overall than Honda's Accord; and has a much better warranty than Ford's Mustang. What else needs to be said? "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Kia, 07/08/2006,Great Car,5,"I have this car for a month and I have put 1,200 mills on it. I love driving this car. It's beautiful, comfortable, and fast. I very much like the new designe of the new Eclipse, it very much looks like the 350Z and the Audi TT or even the Mazda RX-8. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,JMRO, 07/11/2006,Like my Eclipse,4,"I had been interested in an Eclipse for several years.  Now that Mitsubishi has built a serious sports coupe, I decided to purchase.  And, I am glad that I did!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Masahiro, 07/13/2006,Fun Sports Coupe,4,"I've been following the Eclipse since 8/05, and finally purchased the '06 Eclipse GT (6-seepd man.) in June after reading several reviews and a few car magazine articles.  I test drove the Audi TT Coupe in 5/06, and was impressed. Then, I drove the Eclipse the following week.  Again, I was impressed!  If money wasn't an issue, I'd buy the Audi TT.  Not because of any quality issues, but because it came in AWD.  For the price, however, the Eclipse was a much better buy.  It's also a sharper looking coupe than the TT - it really gets noticed!  In our household, we have an '00 Nissan Maxima SE and an '03 Nissan Sentra SE- R Spec-V (6-speed.man.)  But, they are not even close to my new Eclipse in performance!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Bob, 07/22/2006,Style and quality - the Eclipse,4,"The Eclipse is the most beautiful car on the road bar none, at any price.  It is a sculpted work of art that drives.  I love it. It has more of a head-jerk factor than cars costing $100,000 more. I am disappointed in the gas mileage it is giving me - I am getting around 16 - 17 in the city, tis is for a 4-cyl. stick without running the a/c and not getting on it. The results on the highway arn't much better - maybe 24. It is geared pretty low. But I can't not love it, even with the terrible gas mileage.  It is too nice.   "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Kryto76, 08/03/2006,I Love It,4,"The only thing I wish that Mitsubishi had done was let the fog lamps stay on if you pressed the button. Instead you have to turn them on all the time when you turn on the head lamps.  Also, this car needs an MP3 jack for the iPod. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Karen O'Sullivan, 08/06/2006,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse,5,"This car is AWESOME! It's great looking, handles great, has good safety features, has good fuel economy, has an incredible sound system, has great acceleration (surprising for a 4 cylinder!), nicely lighted guages, and is really really fun to drive!  It is definitely a great car for the money.  GO FOR IT!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,J, 08/19/2006,'06 Eclipse,4,The 2006 Eclipse is a beautiful car inside and out.  For a 4-cyl. car it is suprisingly peppy and has quick acceleration. The sun and sound package is a necessity with the GS putting out an impressive 650 watts. I am very pleased with the car overall and feel that it will give the compitition a run for its money.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,aburke80, 06/15/2005,It's Awesome,4,"The sales consultant was very knowledgable and treated me with respect even though I wasn't dressed in my everyday business suit.  Other than that, the car pretty much sold itself.  Must get the 650W Rockford Fosgate upgraded audio system.  It absolutely knocks your socks off.  It's been the best purchase I've made in a long time.  It's a serious reason to rubberneck."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,rolwesj, 06/16/2005,Just got it!,5,"I have been researching this car for about a month now and just purchased it yesterday. I expected a car that would be fun to drive (and it is), but I was pleasantly suprised at all of the safety advancements made such as a 6 airbag system, advanced frame design intended to absorb most of the shock in an impact, etc.. Ergonomically, sitting in the driver's seat is like sitting in a cockpit of a fighter jet (very comfortable and the car seems built around you). The ice blue backlighting for the instruments looks VERY cool especially at night! I would recommend staying away from the base model, as most of the really cool things are only on the GT with the acc. packages."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jason From Jersey, 06/16/2005,The way the Eclipse was meant to be!,4,"This car is a pure and powerful head turner. The perfect blend of style, performance, and personality. This is a car that tuners can appreciate due to its 263hp and 260 torque. This car rivals the likes of the Mazda RX-8, Nissan 350z, Infiniti G35, Acura RSX, Toyota Celica, and the Ford Mustang 2005. More spacious backseat then the Generation 1 & 2 but still maintains head clearance issues in the back seat. Overall however its a perfect car for a tuner or someone who just can't afford that new BMW. So go out and take a test drive today and you can be sure to see the value."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,pcmacbob, 07/03/2005,The new Eclipse,4,"I just purcased a new Eclipse and have fell in love with it with one exception.  The radio is suppose to play mp3 CD's (which it does) but after creating a few of them and inserting them into the 6 CD changer and trying to eject them all of a sudden one won't eject and know the cd unit won't even play anything.  I looked in the manual to  see if there is a way to manually eject the cd, but it says that you need to take it to the dealer.  This might and probably will be a problem for buyers of the Rockford system.  I did not see anywhere in the manual what CD manufacturer you should use for the stereo.  My first tank I got 25 mpg.  I have the 4 speed auto and love it also."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Gustavo, 07/03/2005,The Eclipse is Back and Better than Ever,5,"I bought a new 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT in May of 2005.  I have enjoyed it and continue to enjoy it.  The outside physical appearance is aggressive and mean.  The interior is sporty and sophisticated at the same time.  People stare at it while driving down the road.  If you like what it looks like on the pictures on this web site then imagine what it will look like once it is fixed up.  I have already tinted the windows and added 20"" rims.  I plan on adding a body kit once they become available to make it look even better.  I recommend it to anyone in the market for a new car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Seadofan, 07/12/2005,This car may very well save Mitsubishi!,4,"I purchased in mid-June. I just love this car!  It reminds me of my '95 Eclipse GSX.  This is the fourth Eclipse I've owned.  Interior style updated with driver ergonomics in mind.  Spacious interior (salesman says car is wider than Ford Explorer) with sexy body lines make this one a real looker.  Ride is firm with only a touch of torque steer.  350Z & G35 both exceed price of the Eclipse.  Living in the midwest, I have to consider performance in winter conditions. FWD Eclipse handling in adverse conditions trumps RWD 350Z & G35's handling.    Dealer called me to advise of recall on master cylinder, offered a free loaner so I could do errands during repair.  Kudos on customer service!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,usmcweathr, 07/14/2005,2006 Eclipse GT,4,"Have only had for 2 weeks and have only put 445 miles on it but so far I love it.  I like the red/blue dash lights.  The drivers seat is very comfortable although I have not taken it on any long trips yet.  Gas mileage could be better but if I was really concerned about it I would not of got it.  Forget about putting anyone in the back seat.  Where I have the drivers seat there is about 2 inches left.  It's very fun to drive and is fast.  The car really takes off in 2nd and 3rd at 4,000 rpm's.  I got the Rockford/fosgate system and it sounds great.  Overall this is a great car so far and I would recommend it to anyone looking at them."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Louis, 07/20/2005,HOT,5,"This car is so hot!  It has lots of power and the car looks HOT!! Plenty of room, love the sound system. 6 air bags + ABS."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Sandy, 07/19/2005,Love thec ar; it's fun and eye looker,5,"Car is beautiful. Went from a truck to this new look. It is fast, great to look at and fun to drive."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Randall, 07/20/2005,a real head turner,4,"I had an '01 Eclipse (version 3) and had no intention of getting another one.  It's not that it was a bad car, but just wanted a bit more.  Well... the '06 Eclipse (version 4) has that bit more!  Huge power increase!  Unbelievable stereo!  Fantastic new design modled after the Eclipse version two.  This version is slightly bigger than the past car so there is a bit more head room and leg room.  Other than two recalls (for the same brake problem), I am a very happy new Eclipse driver."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,EclipseGT01022, 08/01/2005,About as good as it gets,5,"For performance, comfort and style, there is nothing that compares to the 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT in its class. The two other cars that were considered (Acura RSX Type S, Ford Mustang V6), they were either slower or simply offed much less for what their asking price was. For $23,000 (base 6 speed Eclipse GT), you get WELL above average acceleration, gobs of low and mid-range torque, and super fuel economy (85% highway / 15% city nets my Eclipse @ 30MPG!, consistantly). Handling is very secure. The interior is simplistic, yet different with lots of character. Best of all, the quality is excellent inside. Long distance driving is second nature with its Recardo-style bucket seats. Buy it!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Newbie, 08/02/2005,Great Car!,5,"This car is a blast to drive.  Not only is it a head turner because of its wonderful exterior design, but it's very responsive and has excellent handling.  When I got behind the wheel for the first time, I was surprised, although it is a 4-cylinder, it truly is a sports car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,timm, 08/04/2005,Fun Car,4,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT is a really fun car.  It drives really smoothly, has great power and is surprisingly very comfortable."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,rasonjason92, 08/08/2005,2006 Eclipse GS Review,4,"The design and overall performance of this car are outstanding. However the craftsmanship is a little lacking. With in two weeks of my purchase the passenger side door started to rust, and now the dashpad has started to bubble a little. But overall I am happy with my purchase."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Luis, 08/18/2005,Amazing,5,"This is what I have been waiting for.  This car is so beautiful and the interior is just plain amazing with the Terra Cotta and gauges based off a motorcycle you can't beat it, especially at night."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,GThomas, 08/18/2005,Mitsubishi does it again!,5,"I own a 2nd generation Eclipse and when the 4th generation came out, I was put on the waiting list. The car is awesome, full of power and a great surround sound system to boot! The sport seats are extremely comfortable and headroom and visability are good as well.  Great styling rounds out this great ride.  It should do well."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,cpk, 08/21/2005,Pure Adrenaline,4,"So far this has been an incredible experience. The dealership was great, the car is a blast to drive both on winding back roads or the high speed interstates. The sport shift automatic transmission works great. The seats are comfortable on long trips and the controls are well placed. The fit and finish is perfect. The '06 Eclipse is the perfect combo of great looks and performance. To top it all off you can't beat the warrenty and the price for a car in this performanc catagory."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,SherriRhiannon, 08/22/2005,People stop me everywhere about my car!,4,"I get stopped by strangers everywhere so they can tell me how much they like my car! It looks like and sports car and drives like one!  The new body style is gorgeous and original.  The interior is made for the driver, not the passengers, no room for a backseat passenger.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,dee, 09/03/2005,My Eye Catcher,5,The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse is awesome!  I get plenty of people asking if they can look inside.  I even got a couple of thumbs up on the interstate while taking a weekend trip.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,neogeo, 09/03/2005,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT (Got Torque),4,"This car is just awesome.  It is the best Eclipse ever.  I put it in first, second, third, fourth, fifth, six gear and it just wants more power. The initial takeoff is amazing and it is an eye catcher if you're single.  It has great response, a great sound, and amazing control.  I just wish I can find ground effects for this car soon, before everyone has one. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jessica Nevins, 09/19/2005,Awesome Car!,4,"My Eclipse is very nice.  It gets awesome gas mileage, and I love the way almost everything looks.  The 6 disc CD changer is awesome.  I definitely will stay in the Mitsubishi family!!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Purchasinggirl, 09/29/2005,Zippity do dah,4,I love this car! I have had people stop and take pictures of it with their cell phones. I am always being stopped and asked if that's the new Eclipse. The interior lights are great. The down side is that it is hard to backup because of the rear visibility. There is basically no back seat and it is difficult for tall people to fit in the front. I would have liked to have automatic door locks which is not an option. I feel safer knowing my doors have locked for me when I put the car in park. Let's not forget the stereo rocks!
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,KWL33181, 09/30/2005,WOW,4,"I just purchased my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT 6-speed, and WOW. It is extremely fast, and fun. Finding a dealer to give me the price I wanted was the hard part, but know it will be not getting too many tickets.  I look forward to racing it in the SCCA, should be fun.  It took me four weeks to get this car, hard to get all the options I wanted, but it was well worth the wait."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,drc, 10/05/2005,Practically Perfect,4,"I have had three other Eclipses - a 1992, which I traded after a few months for an identical model that was turbocharged, and then a 2000 Eclipse GT.  This one is obviously the best of the bunch.  Every feature, from the radio to the door locks to the dash to the seats to the glove box - everything - is better than the previous model, and I liked my 2000 very much.  I can say that I have had absolutely no mechanical problems with any of my Eclipses.  I drove the last one over five years and only changed the oil and the tires.  They have been totally problem free.  I cross shopped this with the Nissan 350Z - too many tire problems, and the Chrylser Crossfire - which I decided was too small."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,XYZ, 12/06/2005,Nice GT Ride,4,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT is a nice ride. I have only done city driving, I can't wait for a mountain ride this weekend. It has lots of low end torque, and it pulls it to the right when pressing the acceleration. The sporty ride is comfortable for long jaunts and the 6-speed manual transmission is very very fun to drive. The interiors, are clean, minimalistic, and functional, including the back seat. You can only fit two adults comfortably, however you can fold the split rear seats for cargo space. It's a little wide, however it's a Galant with a different body, and sportier suspension, which is not a bad thing. The body style is modern, it's an American sized GT coupe. I am looking forward to a road trip to try it out. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ken, 12/07/2005,2006 Eclipse 6 SPD,4,"I put 135,000 miles on a 1996 Eclipse GST-5 spd.  I have waited for years for a satisfactory replacement in terms of performance, looks and being fun to drive. The 2006 Eclipse GT fits! It has so much torque at the low end! I love upshifting at 2,000 RPM, just to feel the incredible torque! VITEC kicks in at about 4,000 RPM. I hit 4,000 RPM so seldom I'm always stunned at the extra power. The owner's manual states max MPH per gear as 55 (2nd), 80 (3rd), 108 (4th).  This is ~6,000 RPM. These are reasonable speeds as HP peaks at 5750 and engine is red lined at 6500. At any speed between 15-100, the drive train is happy in any of 3 gears! Pay very close attention when down shifting though as it's easy to get cross the gate and get 3rd instead of 5th, or 2nd instead of 4th."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,EclipseD, 12/18/2005,Love it,5,"Had my Mitsubishi Eclipse GT since beginning of November and I absolutely love it.  It gets a lot of stares.  It has great power.  I love everything about it.  I can't really complain about anything.  Its a definite ""must drive."""
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Goran, 01/11/2006,"Wow, it's so much FUN",4,"I've been driving my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS for two weeks now and wow, what can I say...I love it. Everybody loves it. Heads turn wherever I go. It has excellent looks, power, and I love the stereo (I got the upgraded 650W).  It's a joyride. I do recommend getting a small mirror to extend your view. It does have a few blind spots...but sho cares.  ENJOY!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jennifer, 01/13/2006,"Awesome ""whip""",4,"I have had my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse for about 6 months now. I have not had any problem with it and I love it. I get lots of compliments and looks, a lot of them from the police! I have always wanted an Eclipse and I am glad that I chose this one. I agree with everyone else in that it is a ""driver's"" car.  There is not a lot of space in the backseat.  It also became a little pricey when I went to tint the windows, because there were so many ""little ones.""  I also think that the cost of repairs seems to be a bit expensive.  I had my car for 3 months and hit a deer. it took almost 2 months to fix because of the new body style, but it isn't the car's fault."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Linda Jones, 01/31/2006,My First Import,4,"I have never bought a non-American car before.  I have been driving Crysler's Sebrings and Dodge Avengers since the Avenger first came out.  I do like the previous cars, but they no longer make a Sebring with a manual transmission and I couldn't find a used one.  The Eclipse caught my eye with its stying.  I LOVE it.  It's very fun to drive!  I love the looks and feel.  We'll see about the reliability.  Time will tell. I sure hope it holds up as well as the Cryslers, as I have very good luck with them.  This car is quieter as well.  It does not have as much road noise.  It handles like a dream and is very comfortable to drive.  The lumbar feature is wonderful on the back on long drives!  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,argentum, 01/29/2006,We Luv It,4,"OK. So Car and Driver and Motor Trend hate this car. Consumer Reports didn't care much for it either. This fifty year old couple read the positive consumer reviews here and at CU, threw caution to the wind after test driving one, and bought it. Well, what's not to like? Aside from good looks, the Eclipse runs and rides just fine. It's way smoother and quieter than the Acura RSX-S that we just finished leasing. The five speed stick is a breeze, the ride is composed and handling is surprisingly tight. I prefer the good low end torque to high revving horsepower. Get the upgraded Rockford- Fosgate sound system. It blows away the Acura Bose. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Pam, 01/30/2006,**** Love My Car ****,4,"I love my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse, it don't be fooled - it's a two seater! The backseat is a place to haul groceries during the day and throw your coat on Friday night! I chose this car after test driving at least 20 different models, all makes. It is a great combo of gas mileage, cost, style and stereo. I'm the coolest mom at my daughter's school cause my stereo out thumps anyone's and my car looks good!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Roachie, 02/22/2006,I Love my New Eclipse,4,"I was trying to decide between etting a new Honda Civic Si and the Eclipse.  They both have about the same specs, although, the Eclipse is a much sexier car, much more of a ""sports"" car then a ""Honda.""   I love the Eclipse and I am so glad that I bought the it over the Honda.  I have enjoyed driving it, staring at it and owning it!  I made a great choice!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,wattage3, 03/02/2006,Addicted to driving it!,4,Its been three months now and I still am looking for excuses to drive my 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS. I get compliments everywhere I go. I do not way regret in anyway choosing this car.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Lauren, 03/08/2006,I Love This Car,5,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse is so much fun.  When I first bought it I drove everywhere just for the sake of driving.  I would find things to do just to get back into this car.  It makes driving a wonderful experience that you won't want to end.  Highway driving is the best, with terrific handling and controlled speed this car can do almost anything.  It definitely is a winner."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,MK, 03/19/2006,2006 Eclipse GT,3,"We have currently put 12,000 miles on our Eclipse GT. It's fun to drive, handles well (even on the icy roads), and accelerates nicely. The front seats in the GT are extremely comfortable for people of an average size, though can be restricting for larger people. The standard heated leather in the GT (front only) is wonderful for the cold weather. I won't even mention the rear seating - it's a joke really, even with the front seats pushed far forward there is no leg room for anyone in the back. Don't consider this vehicle if you plan on having more than one passenger very often."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,scott, 03/21/2006,this is the best Eclipse ever,5,"The new engine puts out about 270 horsepower about the same torque.  The Eclipse handles excellently for a car that weighs more than the pervious versions. The exhaust is sweet to hear growl when I start it up. The interior is great as well, with everything within reach"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,D Storm, 04/03/2006,Head Turner,4,"The first thing I can say is while sitting at a red light in my new Eclipse a guy in a new Corvette pulled up beside me, is all smiles and says hey nice car! The new styling is great. The power that the GS 5M delivers is incredible for a 4-cylinder. So they have it governed at a top speed of around 122 mph! It handles incredibly; the purr of the exhaust can be heard throughout your drive. If you love to drive and love to have a little bit of attention I recommend buying it.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,David M. L., 04/30/2006,23 years later and it is a whole new Mitsubishi,5,"I swore I would never buy another Mitsubishi after a disaster with an '83 Cordia; but, I was seduced by the looks of the brand new 2006 Eclipse.  I put aside my misgivings and bought a 4 cyl. GS -- And, I am blown away by the power, feel, quality, and so far reliability of this wonderful car.  Don't believe the reviews that say a 4 cyl. auto. has no power.  This car has plenty and with $3.00 + gas it is very thrifty.  I got the fog lights installed along with the very reasonably priced optional power & sun package and I have a car that is HOT!  People can't believe it only cost in the low $20's.  I love it and think I really scored!  It is sporty enough and my wife agrees!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,carol mcmenamin, 04/30/2006,What a Car!,4,"I am thrilled with the new design of the Eclipse. It handles so well and is fun to drive.  Everyone turns and does a double take when I drive by. The interior is so different, it has motorcycle gauges. This car isn't just for teens, adults love it too.  I even bought my husband one."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Mike R, 05/01/2006,2006 Eclipse - Buy It!,4,"This mid 40's male retires the family minivan to buy the Eclipse GS manual trans (couldn't afford a Porsche). I got both the Sun & Sound and Accessory packages, which both add nice features. The GS is more than peppy enough around town to get me into trouble, but it could use a few more HP on the highway to pass. It really begins to shine on twisty backroads. Its acceleration, handling, and braking are all excellent. This car is built very well - no squeaks or rattles. Its fit and finish are execellent. The ride is a little harsh depending on road surface, but hey, it's a sports car. It is a real head turner and it's even got a little growl from the intake/exhaust. It is very fun to drive!  Compared to the Mustang, RX8 and 305Z - this is a much better value."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Alejandro, 05/12/2006,Eclipse reborn,4,"The new Eclipse has been reborn and it brought the fun back.  It has been improved for the better.  It provides good control, good response, and has a nice design.  The automatic transmision responds well as the does the manual.  The 263 horsepower makes this almost as pleasant as the Mitsubishi Evolution.  It has really comfortable seats and more interior space."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,GTinSilver, 05/15/2006,The most fun you can have on 4 wheels!,5,"The Mitsubishi Eclipse GT is an awesome sports car.  The insurance is affordable and the car is loaded with extra features. The styling is similar to the second generation, and in 5 years I'm looking into getting the 5th generation Eclipse. I think they should call the convertible model - the Solar Eclipse, rather than the Spyder."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Michael H., 06/10/2006,Great Car!,5,"I had a 2003 Eclipse GT, loved it and hand no problems up even when I traded it at 96,000 miles.  Just got a new 2006 Eclipse GT with the premium package and I love it!  The stereo rocks, and everyone drools over it.  My girl friend has a 350Z and even she is jealous.  The premium package is a must!  It is worth the extra money.  This is my everyday driver and it is great for commuting and long trips."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,mplschemo, 06/12/2006,The 2006 Eclipse RULES,4,"I recently bought a 2006 Eclipse and man does it rock!  It definitely turns heads.  The torque that it puts out is insane for a car that size and can easily beat most stock cars on the market today.  Driving at night is awesome.  The interior glows a dark blue and everything is easy to read.  The only downside to the car is the gas.  I drive this car so hard and fast that I get about 15 miles per gallon in the city.  Sure, you can get the 18 mpg if you drive nicely but why would you buy this car if you were going to?  All around this is an excellent car and I will be driving it for many years!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,MIKE, 06/12/2006,The pursuit of perfection,5,"I love the looks and the handling of the '06 Eclipse, and the safety features it offers are the best, especially for a sports car. It is comfortable and fast.  My wife is in love with this car.  The audio system is excellent."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jonathan, 06/12/2006,Extremely Fun Car!,4,"The '06 Eclipse is one of the best cars around. I was about to buy a Scion tC but this car caught my eye before I almost got that. I'm so happy I got this! It's the best when your driving home with the windows down and everyone stares cause most people haven't seen it on the road! I've only seen two on the road since I got it, and I've had it for a couple months now."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,screwy, 07/14/2006,Incredibly fun to drive coupe!,4,From the first day I got this car until now I have loved driving it and watching heads turn. I have gotten so many compliments my only complaint would be that I can't look at how sexy it looks while sitting inside. It is a little pricey but when you consider those sleek curves and form fitting sporty seats its hardly anything to complain about. I recommend a test drive at night so you can fully appreciate the cool blue lighting within the simple and sporty cockpit. I just took this car on a weekend getaway and it fit both of our dufflebags in the cargo area even with the subwoofer in there. One thing is for sure this is a sporty car which is not meant for long trips yet is packed with thrills!
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ryan, 07/31/2006,"Sporty, Nice, Roomy, Sexy, Car",4,"This car is great! One thing to note is the 0-60 and 1/4 mile times. In Denver Colorado with a stock car I can pull a 6.3 0-60 and a 14.99 1/4 at 96.8 MPH at the track.  I raced an Audi A-6 2.7 V6 Twin-Turbo with an automatic transmission. The Eclipse is faster off the line and will hold the A6 through the quarter, assuming you don't burn out too much.  I also raced an '04 mustang GT with exhaust. We were neck and neck, I could not tell who was ahead. I love this car, I use it for work, It is an eye catcher. Everybody always complements me, and to be honest it rides nicely.  It's a tad heavy up front but handles quite well. I recommend jumping up to 18"" rims with wider tires."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,mike4usc99, 07/31/2006,Fun in the Sun!,4,"This car gets as many looks as a Ferrari.  I've had nothing but great things to say about my 2006 automatic Eclipse GS.  I purchased the Sun & Sound Package (sunroof and powered subwoofer) which makes all the difference if you're a music fan!  Many people have complained about the blind spots when changing lanes, but you pretty much get used to it after a while.  The back seats are really for small children, adults will be very cramped.  The back seats fold down which allows for a great deal of trunk space for those who need it!  The interior is great and the blue lights on the dash are something else.  I drive pretty conservatively and usually get around 23 MPG.  I love the car!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,travisfieldcop, 08/25/2006,VERY Impressed,5,This is my first Mitsubishi and my first sports coupe.  I was attracted to the new Eclipse as soon as I saw it.  It's incredibly fun to drive and turns many heads.  I enjoy driving and watching people turn to look and admire the car.  I have received several compliments on the exterior styling.  All and all I am VERY pleased and excited to own this car.  I selected the GS model because of the price and do not regret it at all.  It's a blast to drive!
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,JPudas71, 09/03/2006,Good Driving Car!,4,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a good driving car for someone like me that has a 80+ miles a day to work.  It gets really good gas milage, which is good now that gas is so expensive.  The looks I get are great and the car is so cute and stylish.  My kids think it's a race car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,RED, 09/04/2006,Style and Quality,4,"The Eclipse is one of the most beautiful cars on the road. I love it. It has more of a head-turning factor than cars costing $100,000 more. I am a little disappointed in the gas mileage it is giving me. I'm getting around 16 to 17 in the city, tis is for a 4-cyl. NOT GOOD! It's not what the sticker said and NOT what I expected from a 4 cyl vehicle. My old car was a 6-cyl. and I got the same gas mileage, but had more power."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Mike Soffer, 10/05/2006,Fun and Fast,4,"I have put about 4,500 miles on the car. The slap stick is great and its nice to just slip into drive when in heavy traffic. The car is great except for the ""back seat"" it is just for show or to punish your kids. Its handling is excellent. Its steering is very quick. This is a sports car for Dad. I have found that the car runs best on 93 gas. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Mr. Eclipse, 10/10/2006,My Review...The Real Deal,4,"I'm 17 years old and we purchased my '06 Eclipse back in July.  I love this car so much.  Plus, it helps me feel better about myself.  All my friends like the car too.  I love driving the 6-speed manual.  I wouldn't have settled for the automatic.  This is deffinitely a car that holds its own on the streets.  And it turns plenty of heads as you drive by in style.  Just don't plan on taking a few friends out for the night.  Maybe one in the back, but that's all the backseat is going to fit comfortably.  And that's if they recline in the whole seat with their legs up in the seat.  It's tiny back there.  But if you want to take that nice young lady out for the night alone, it is awesome."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ryan, 10/14/2006,Great Car!,5,This is a great car for the money. I have had it for about a year with no problems.  It gets awesome gas mileage and has awesome looks.  All of my friends are jealous..
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,dreamcar, 10/19/2006,dreamcar,4,"I purchased my Eclipse about a year ago, right when they came out and iIjust love everything about it.  I think it is one of the most stylish cars I've ever seen.  I mean it's been a year since it came out and people still turn their heads to look at it."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,okeedokee, 11/04/2006,"Not the Greatest, Not the Worst",4,"This is not the best nor the worst car I have ever owned. I have had many issues with rattles one in the rear suspension.  Also, the check engine light came on with a misfire.  The dealer is still trying to find one more rattle (possibly in the tail light).  I love driving it and its nice to look at, but I hate having to take it in every few 1,000 miles.  The dealership has been helpful in resolving the issues.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,eclipse6racer, 11/18/2006,Sweet Ride!,4,"First off, the obvious about this car...it looks sweet, it handles great, it's fast ,and has a cool interior design especially with the glowing blue leds.  What this car is not is a four seater, nor a three seater as the back has absolutely no room.  I'm 6'2"" and most of my friends are tall as well.  But hey, why buy a sports car if you have a family?  Go get yourself a minivan in that case!  Anyways, it's a very sweet ride and it is fast.  I love it,and if you love the sound of a race car, and I don't mean just change the damn muffler, throw a magnaflow exhaust on minus the resonator and second cat and it sounds better than any of those Fast and Furious rides from the movie yummy!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,TJ & Faye, 01/15/2007,Two Issues,4,"I have only two issues with this vehicle. The first is the lack of a locking fuel door. The second is the passenger leg room is totally limited. Otherwise, we LOVE this car. It's fast, looks great and sounds great. A lady followed us home the first day we got the car to inquire what it was and about the color. We got the sunset pearl. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Jason S, 01/25/2007,GS or GT?,4,When I drove the GS I thought it was a pretty neat car. Then I made the mistake of driving the GT and had to fork over some more money to take that one. The ride is fairly quiet and it is great to drive. The interior at night is very pleasant on the eyes. The front seats are very comfortable!
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,carlos vega, 02/14/2007,Girly Looking Car that Kicks Butt,4,The 2006 Eclipse GT is a great car.  It is a lot of fun and girls love it.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,eclipseboi4u, 04/12/2007,This thing is amazing,4,"This is an amazing ride. It handles great and has one of the best safety ratings. Stock, its component sound system is great. I have completely redone new speakers all the way around plus 2 subs which improved the sound, which is great still using the factory head unit. The 4 wheel ABS with front wheel drive is great especially for those tight turns. As for a 2.4L 4 cyl with 162 horses under the hood isn't bad for a stock 4 cyl. Hey the gas mileage is great if you use premium gas. If you use low grade, you will burn gas faster and probably reduce your mpg by 5%. If you want to greatly improve your mpg horsepower and torque do what i did... add a cold air intake & full exhaust."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Lilgabri03, 08/16/2007,Love this car,4,"I bought these car about a month ago and I have enjoyed it greatly. I am 22 and right out of college and I was looking for something sporty and nice, but at the same time that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Masahiro, 09/18/2007,"Still the ""Fun"" Sport Coupe",5,"It's been nearly one and a half years and 16000 miles since I purchased my Eclipse.  So far, it still performs like it did when I first got it.  It's running great!  I'm totally satisfied with my vehicle.  The only improvement I made last month was getting a new set of tires.  Got the Kumho ultra high performance (slightly wider than the original Goodyears).  And, it certainly was worth the money - rides even better!  I'm hoping to get many more ""fun"" years with this Eclipse."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Mitsuwomn, 11/17/2007,Best of Three Eclipses I've Owned,4,Looks like a 'future car' both interior and exterior.  The V6 engine is quite powerful & the car handles great.  It is much tighter than the 3g version. It's my every day driver and it makes my commute fun!
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,BartD, 12/03/2007,Happy With the Car.,4,"I have had the car for almost 2 years. I have had no mechanical problems with it and still has the same power as when I got it from the dealer. The only problem was my driver seat motor broke, and squeaky brakes. But all were replaced under warranty. I'm happy with the car, but I am getting tired of squeezing passengers in. The road/wind noise is also starting to get to me. When you first purchase the car your notice the wheel gap is huge. While on the mitsu posters/commercials there is none. Lower the car to make it look better. I have gotten nothing but compliments for this car. It is great,strong engine, quality seats, and fun to drive but it is not very economical"

mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Speedy Cowgirl, 12/05/2007,"Love my Eclipse GT Special Edition ""RV""",4,"After a decked out 300M ""couch on wheels,"" I didn't think I'd be happy with a small car.  The Eclipse is stronger than my 300M was, and very sharp looking with the ground effects.  I LIVE in my car (thus the RV part of my title). I drive 130 miles/day round trip to work. 2000-mile roundtrip road trips a couple of times/year, without disappointment; 50000 in 20 months!  It has excellent handling and performance, although difficult to park.  It consistently gets 28 mpg as long as I don't drive like a fool. Seat heat & ""vibrating massage"" from the 650w speaker are also nice on road trips.  The car is built for one person, although passenger will enjoy seat heat/leg room, but no power seat."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,LoCo68, 04/21/2008,Beautiful Car,4,Couldn't wait for this to come out and I bought one of the first 2006 models on the market in June of '05.  Owned an Eagle Talon in '92. Decided on the 4cyl due to the gas mileage. The car takes curves nicely and there is no lack of power. Wish I had upgraded to the 6c and the better sound system. 
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Ammar, 04/29/2008,Ammar,5,Nice car. Fun to drive. Very good looking and awesome stereo. Great for sports car lovers who r not willing to spend a lot.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Paul Workmaster, 04/08/2017,Driving my Eclipse makes me feel young again,5,"I bought a 2006 brand new and it has been a great little car. Very dependable and a lot of fun to drive. For a 4 cylinder engine it has a lot of spunk when coupled with my 5 speed transmission. I'm over 6' tall and still have adequate leg room in the front seats. The back seat room is non-existent though. On a positive note the trunk room with the rear seat folded down is big enough to haul some fairly large items. I previously owned 3 other Eclipses: a 1992, a 1995, a 2001 and this one. I'd buy another one but they don't make them anymore.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2006,Christopher (KING) Miller, 05/18/2018,Love it or hate it,5,"honestly buying this car was the best thing I've ever done. It's a sports car for somebody who can't afford high-end sports cars. the V6 engines got a lot of power the Transmissions very easy to use and regardless of what you've read on fuel economy I averaged about 22 miles to the gallon. The Hydraulics for the back hatch go out which is expected in hatchbacks. the clear coat on the paint has faded which is also to be expected at that time of painting. and it almost a hundred thousand miles the clutch needs to be replaced. all these things are to be expected from a vehicle that's almost a hundred thousand miles and over 10 years old. altogether if you find one in decent working condition it's well worth the buy.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Marilyn Jacob, 04/02/2010,I Love my Eclipse,4,"I'm a mature woman and love this car but young at heart! It handles very well in all weather conditions, I was mostly impressed as to how it plowed right through the snow and did so well on icy roads. My previous car was heavier but didn't handle well with icy conditions as it seemed to hydroplane, but not my eclipse. I got used to driving with the mirrors more and had no problems seeing other vehicles. Have no fear if you're considering purchasing an Eclipse."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Larry in Boston, 12/09/2006,Took Me a Month to Adapt,4,"This is the first two seater I've ever owned. I had always driven sedans. This car is a good value. Its styling is to my taste and the interior design is well thought out. This car is enjoyable to drive although not a high performance sports car by any measure. I am getting 27 plus miles to the gallon with only 2,000 miles on car so far. I am still adapting to the driver's seat. It took me one month to find a comfortable driving position. Getting used to the passenger side blind spot is no big deal."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Stephen, 09/02/2015,The poor mans porche,5,"This is an amazing car, I call it the poor mans porche because it has the looks and speed of porches but is affordable. I haven't had any issues with it other than a few minor ones. Its a fast beautiful car, it does't have alot of space but that is easy to live with.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Mark, 08/28/2006,Suprised and Pleased,5,"My wife and I were searching for a sporty car that gets decent gas milage at an affordable price.  The '07 Eclipse fits the bill very nicely.  We love the ""new"" body styling.  It had always been my dream to own a Porsche 911 someday. But let's face it, the average person will never be able to afford that. You can get a similar look for 1/4 of the price with the new Eclipse.  The performance of the 4-cylinder engine is really suprising. It has plenty of power for the average driver.  We took it for a 150 miles trip down the Blue Ridge Parkway this past weekend, and it ran and handled like a dream.  I am 6' 3"" and weigh 220 at 52 yrs old.  I can get in and out of the car with no problems."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Flatlandersteve, 09/25/2006,A Wow Car,4,"The 2007 Eclipse is a dream car.  It has the styling of a small speedster, the beauty of a classic sports hatchback, and the get up and go of a roadster. The 6-cyl. 14 valve, 260 HP engine, provide plenty of power to rock the road.  Do not hestitate to take it for long drives. The car hugs the road.  Its ride is very comfortable and there is plenty of room for luggage, the dog, the cooler and the golf clubs. Whether you go with the hard top with the sunroof, or the convertible Spyder, you cannot make a bad choice here. I was set on a two seat roadster so I drove the Solstice, the Sky, the RX-8, and the G6. The Eclipse won the day. There is no need to spend your life savings, you can have it all with the Eclipse. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Doug, 09/21/2006,Best Sports Coupe Value,5,"After testing driving the Scion tC, Honda Civic and the Ford Mustang V6 I test drove and purchased an Eclipse GS.  While it is more expensive than the Scion and the Honda, I felt the Eclipse delivered more value.  It has better acceleration than the Scion or Honda, has more comfortable seats, has a better interior layout, and a has much better exterior design.  I did like the Mustang's exterior design, but it's interior seemed cheap and poorly laid out.  Overall the Mustang (which was more expensive than the Eclipse) just didn't seem to offer as much value."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,MIcheal T., 07/23/2017,I love my 10 year old Eclipse,5,"Yes, I bought my 2007  Eclipse GS new and it is definitely the best car I have ever owned. It's fun to drive, beautiful and reliable I've kept up on all scheduled maintenance, kept her clean and out of the elements as much as possible. And now after 10 years (and 67000 miles) she still  looks and drives like new.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,liz85, 10/12/2013,Awesome car!,4,"This is my second car after my 02 chevy malibu.
Wow! I love it! I average about 27 mpg. I recently took a 3,000 mile trip and this car was awesome! It handles corners amazingly, however, it's not as comfortable as a sedan on long trips (I was expecting it) but it wasn't too terrible. Backseat is very small. The eclipse is a two seater car with backseats. I was hesitant to get the automatic, but the sportstronic transmission is actually a lot of fun. I can't say enough good things about this car and it's certainly a head turner! I always get people trying to race me. The 4 cyl. certainly has more than enough power to get you off the starting line. I love it!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,aris aponte, 05/15/2006,What a car!,5,"If you drive a 2007 Eclipse, you are in for a surprise!  This is the car that will put Mitsubishi on the map again. It has great looks, it is fun to drive, and it has plenty of power to go arround."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Shannon, 05/09/2017,4G Eclipse Gt,5,"This is the second 4g eclipse i have owned. Both were in bad accidents and considered totaled by my insurance company due to debt ratio of estimated repairs vs value of the vehicle. In both accidents, i was able to walk away without a scratch. I also salvaged and repaired both cars and can still say i feel safer in them then i do in most other cars. They are also very comfortable in the front seats. My back seats have never been used for anything but extra storage space cuz there is no room in the back. The radio and climate controls are all within close reach of the driver seat and easy to use. One of the most fun cars to drive. Handles beautifully and corners like a dream. Has a bit of a lag on acceleration, but can really move once it gets going. Highly recommend upgrading the brakes/rotors. Stock brake system was not always reliable, and there was a recall on the ABS system. Rockford fosgate sound system is great. Mechanically sound design.  Really is a fun little car. Lots of options to upgrade and modify. I hope they start making them again.
"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,JohnAZ, 12/08/2006,"What's Up with the ""Pros""",4,"I don't understand the poor reviews of this vehicle by the so-called experts.  I drove several cars (Mustangs (2), Miatas (2), Honda Civic Si, RX-8, Solstice, Corvettes (2)).  While this car is no Corvette (frankly the Corvettes were too much car for me), it is a lot of fun to drive.  In fact, given legal speed limits, I would say it allows one to jump on the gas and still remain at reasonable speeds, i.e., you can actually utilize what the car offers.  And, I liked it much better than the Honda Civic Si - which all the ""experts"" rave about.  If you're looking for a reasonably priced car, and don't plan on limiting your driving to pushing the car to the max on an oval, it's worth trying."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,mimi_the_mivec, 11/04/2014,Mimi the Mivec!,5,"I bought my 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT used from a dealership in which the one owner of the car worked there. I bought it in 2011 with 80,400 miles on it. It's now almost 2015 with a tad bit over 108,000 miles and I've haven't had any issue with it. I've forgot to do oil changes thousands of miles overdue. It's started in nine degree weather fine. I've done over 100mph plenty of times and it was fine. I've been cars price range of $3K all the way to $280k and mine was the best! Yay Mitusbishi! "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,beck_u, 05/21/2011,Great value for money,4,"Reliability: This is the third Mitsubishi in my family, and I knew this was going to be a very reliable vehicle as its predecessors were, we still own the 2002 Galant and totaled another Eclipse.
Fuel economy: I average about 25 mpg on daily commutes and 30.5 mpg highway.
Comfort: It is a great ride for two, especially on long journeys. Rear passenger needs to be less than average height to be ok.
Practicality: The trunk is big enough to easily fit any shopping and with folding rear seats it is huge.
Handling: It accelerates as fast as any other 4 cylinder, cruses effortlessly on highway speeds, and easily gets over 100+ mph. Elderly people may find suspension a bit stiff."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,adamcky90, 07/19/2011,Oh yeah!,5,"I decided it was time for a new car when my 93 Subaru Legacy crapped out. I had intentions on buying a Subaru WRX, but time was an issue so I picked up a 2007 eclipse on the spot. Of course me being a young kid (20) I had to tint the windows and put on a cold air intake (which really does make a difference). But I have had this car for 3 months and have not had an issue at 29,xxx miles. I highly recommend this car, Its a fun car to drive, and its pretty quick for a single over head cam. these cars run a 14.8 in the 1/4 mile and 0-60 in 6.9 seconds. Forget the American gas guzzling pieces of crap, get an import. The variable valve timing (MIVEC) is a great thing."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,drholland77, 11/03/2006,Get Some New Colors,4,"This is the second car of this style I've had.  The first was an Eagle Talon. It is fun to drive.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,godzilla87, 12/27/2014,Love the eclipse!,4,This is my second eclipse. My first one was a 2006 four cylinder. Unfortunately it was totaled in an accident. I missed it so much I went and got a 2007 GT. LOVE IT! The power and handling is amazing. People are always surprised with my takeoff speed. The Rockford fosgate stock system sounds amazing.  Fun car to drive and always gets compliments! 
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Sandi Lubisco, 07/31/2006,My Second Eclipse,4,"I Traded an '01 for the '07 Eclipse.  I loved my '01 model, but had to trade it in. My new car handles easily and is very sleek.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Stacy Wiley, 08/21/2008,"Excellent, Fun Car-Short & Long Distance",4,"I purchased this car brand new off the lot in 2006.  I have been driving it for two years now and would not give it up for the world.  I love the comfort, sportiness, and sexiness it gives me on the road.  The power is excellent for a four cylinder, although I do notice a sluggish start when running the A/C on high from a dead stop.  Long distance drives have not left me with the ""numb butt"" feeling.  That was a plus.  I average about 28-30 mpg in town, if driving casually.  If I romp on it, I can almost see my gas gauge move! Driver tendencies depend on gas mileage.  I love the interior, although the driver side door could have an elbow rest a little higher.  Absolutely great car!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,BaddBradd, 12/12/2009,I love this CAR!!!!,4,Ever since I bought my Eclipse it has been nothing but FUN... I love this car and the experience I've had since owning it. If you're looking for a Mitsubishi i recommend taking a look at the Eclipse. Trust me you will enjoy it.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,kemezei, 07/03/2006,One HOT Little Car,5,"I love my car! This is my second Eclipse, I traded my '03 model for the '07 and I have no regrets. I am always getting compliments on my car. If you don't want to be noticed this is not the car for you. I can't even pump gas into my car without someone coming up to talk to me about it. If you are looking for a family car this is also not the car for you. The backseat serves no purpose other than to put a purse on it when I have a passenger but then again I bought the car for me and being 18 backseats aren't important to me. Foglights are also a must because it makes the car look better and not so cheap with the black plastic inserts."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,fablesofthewest, 05/09/2006,Trading Up...,4,"Just traded my low mileage 2004 Spyder in on the new one - I now have the Sunset Pearlescence colored GT with the Sportstronic transmission (which lets you drive as an automatic AND/OR a five speed manual transmission). Initially I was worried about the trade as I was crazy about my 2004 Spyder. But after having the 2007 for a few days, all my concerns have been eased. The 2007 handles better, rides better, looks more like a luxury car and turns heads more than the previous style. I think I'm going to be a happy camper-so far so good!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Debbi, 06/21/2008,Hot Car!,4,"Overall the car is gorgeous and reliable.  It's heavy and built solid like a tank, which makes me feel safe.  The sound system is FANTASTIC!  It's fun to drive and I always get lots of looks when I'm out and about in it.  Luckily, I'm short so the car offers me lots of room.  I hauled a 32 inch 100 lb tv in the trunk 220 miles to my brothers and had room left over for my luggage and dvd player.  It's all in how you pack your cargo.   "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Scott Jacob, 10/27/2008,Amazing car,4,"I looked for a very long time to get this car.  I bought it with the Rockford stereo, which was a must, and complete with all the options.  I was reluctant at first to buy any car with a 4 cylinder, but was very satisfied after driving mine. It did not take long to figure out that it has an amazing ride, as well as, all the power and handling anyone could ask for. This will not be my last Mitsubishi I promise you that."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Poke, 11/23/2008,Phenomenal Car!,4,"Bought mine used with 17,000 miles on it.  I was just looking for an everyday runner, and this car was available. Simply unbelievable.  I never even looked at Mitsubishi before, but it's true that they've thought of everything.  I have the convertible GT V6, and this baby is a runner, alright.  Previous owner put a carbon fiber hood on her, 20-inch black spoke wheels, an air induction system to increase her horsepower, and all the options!  Wow. She's amazing!  The ride is incredible, the look is amazing, and the officer who pulled up alongside of me to tell me I was going too fast even gave me a thumbs up and a wave!  And my golf clubs fit in the trunk!  You won't be disappointed!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Goatboy, 11/25/2008,Excellent Car!!,5,"I traded in a Dodge Dakota because I wanted a sportier vehicle.  I did my research and after comparing the Mustang, RX-8, Civic-Si, and Eclipse, it was my favorite.  I have had it about a month now and it is the best car I have ever owned.  It's flashy, fast, hauls my golf clubs, and makes mundane trips to work a lot more exciting.  It is an excellent medium between a full on performance car and a livable, daily commuting or touring car.  The stereo is ridiculous.  I didn't know you could get a stereo that sounds that good from the factory!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Alyssa M, 11/26/2008,"Dude, I hit a deer.",4,"This car is amazing. I owned a Cadillac before, and thought I would be disappointed, but its a lot of fun and drives great. I have been rearended by a heavy duty truck, and hit a deer at 50 mph - not a single scratch on the car. It's very reliable and takes a lot of abuse. It's the best car I have ever owned.

I don't check my gas mileage cause the car is made to drive fast.  I make road trips often and the car is very comfortable.  Sound system is excellent.  Love the rear fold down seats.  Two sets of golf clubs and luggage will fit great.  I had a wind deflector installed on the sunrooof and the wind noise with the roof open is gone.  I have the orange one and it is such a head turner.  When driving alone, I recline the rear of the passenger seat and it helps with the blind spot.  This allows for a better view out of the smaller side rear window.  I suggest you buy one today.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Senior Citizen : ), 07/03/2009,"Super, Super Touring Coupe",4,"Best Sports/Touring Coupe 4 the $.  Not a Performance Car, but it does have decent performance/economy for a 4 cyl 162 HP Engine & the 5speed transmission is smooth. Average 25 city & highest MPG was 34 Hwy w/o using A/C. I usually trade once a year, but I'm keeping this one. It has a few limitations, but for your $ investment, you can't go wrong if you are looking for a great touring coupe with a super warranty & features. I've owned a Honda Si, Nissan's, Toyota's, Corvettes, and for the money spent, this is the one I enjoy the most.  Test drive one, & you will want one also.  Enjoy your highways of life more, in an Eclipse. : ) You get more then you pay for in a Eclipse."

I have the sun & sound pkg so I still have some open air. The hatchback has come in handy with our recent move, you can fit a lot in there. Love the exhaust note, comfort & all the looks I get. I have averaged 23 MPG for city driving which is the same as my wife's 04 Spyder so no complaints there. I don't ""get on it"" much because then you will see the needle fall.  I find it funny that the critics hate this car and all of the consumers love it. I'll believe an actual owner over a magazine any day. I expect it will do well in our Ohio snow as did my spyder. Great car and highly recommend!!!"

mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Sylvain Giguere, 07/26/2006,2007 Eclipse GS,4,"I bought the Eclipse GS model last week and it is a fun to drive car.  Its Sportronic transmission it makes you feel in control of the car.  Its acceleration is good for a 4-cylinder and it is a good looking car inside and out. The road handling is very good and makes tring to get more out of the car. So far, it is a very good choice."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Anthony, 08/07/2006,My Clipze,4,Driving this car is very fun and pleasurable.  The '07 Eclipse is a great head turner. Its styling is awesome.  Road trips in it are comfortable and its performance is A-OK even with the 4-cyl. engine and the A/C on. Overall the car is top notch.  We are very happy owners of this vehicle.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Jessica, 08/22/2006,Nice Sporty Car For The Money,4,"This is my first new car purchase and so far I'm really loving this car. The exterior styling is gorgeous and the interior is in two words ""simple elegance,"" not too overly done but eye catching none the less. The front seats are very comfy but the back seat is small with no leg room, but that doesn't bother me since I don't sit back there! :) It's got a peppy engine for a 4-cyl. but does get a little sluggish with the A/C on in my opinion. It takes turns like nothing and the the brakes are also wonderful, It it the best vehicle I've ever experienced. The Rockford Fosgate sterio is killer, a MUST have. All around I adore this car and it's a huge step up from my '01 Grand Am. Buy one, youu'll love it!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Rick, 02/26/2008,Fun to drive.,3,This is my commuter mobile. It has plenty of power and torque despite it's a 4 cylinder engine. Plenty of interior room for front seats but the rear seats are not for people - just extra storage space. You get a lot of car for its price - style and performance compared to its competitors.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Sarah, 09/12/2006,"Fun To Drive, But...",4,"Well I've had my '07 Eclipse GS for about three months now so I think I have a good enough feel for the pros and cons to rate this car and give it a review.  First of all the car looks GREAT. The design on the exterior is so innovative and curvy. The interior is a beautiful blue color at night thanks to the little blue LED lights inside the dash. However, the plastic on the doors and other parts of the interior IS CHEAP.  I barely knick the door and there's a scratch. I can't have anyone sit in the back if there wearing heels because I am afraid they might scratch the plastic. I really hate the fear of scratching my plastic every time I take a ride, but over all the car is nice."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,dave4408, 10/01/2006,Sweet,5,This car is very fun to drive.  The sportronic transmission resembles a ratchet shifter for an early model hot rod or muscle car in efficiency and the low-end stereo is quite sufficient for for most people.  I only wish there was performance enhancers to make it that much faster.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,mneddy, 02/11/2007,Best Car in It's Class,4,Love absolutely everything about the 2007 Eclipse GT. The design is the best. It is extremely fun to drive. It sticks to the road like glue. It is very good in winter driving. This car is absolutely comfortable and FUN to drive.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,mitsubishimot88, 04/04/2007,What a car,5,"Some people don't like this car because it's a V6 and front wheel drive, but it doesn't matter what they think when I'm passing Mustangs with their V8s. This car doesn't only look fast, it can back it up. If you don't regularly drive more than 1 person you should be fine, otherwise it might be an issue with the back legroom being absent. But the interior is great, displays all blue at night, has sunroof, 6 disc rockford phosgate system, displays the temp, cd track and time. I'm very pleased with this car."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,MitsuMadness, 08/06/2007,2007 Eclipse GS,4,"This is my first Eclipse and I love it. I get so many comments from so many people and it feels good. I wish the car was lighter and had dual overhead cams instead of a single because I'm 24 and I like to have a lot of power, but with modifications it could be a power house.  Over all I love the car, the feel of it on the road, the inspirated racing seats, the blue gauges astound me every time.  This is a very fun car to drive and fun to look at, its a real eye catcher."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Lisa-Marie Arpaia, 06/12/2007,My First Coupe,4,"This is a classy car. Eclipse SE 2.4ltr automatic (black). The 18"" alloy wheels on this beautifully wide coupe make a driver feel secure, especially in bad driving conditions, as well as make you look good while driving... lol! Very smooth ride. I've only had this vehicle for a few days. Although I researched my options with other makes and models prior to this decision, I must admit, I'm very pleased! "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Armin, 09/21/2007,Keep on reading... dont give up!,4,"For the price I paid for this car I think it was the best on the market. As far as toys and looks go it is a very very good car. If you are not planning to race around professionally, the performance is good enough for you and the stereo system, design, etc., makes the car look more expensive than it actually is."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,troff, 10/20/2007,Most fun for your money!,5,"I love this car. It's not as sporty as G1/G2 Eclipses, though it traded some of its sportiness to a true everyday comfort and that was a square deal. It's still fun to drive either it's mountain Colorado roads, everyday commute or 2000 miles vacation trip to Yellowstone. Ride is smooth but you have all the control through the corners you can expect from a n Eclipse. V6 gives more than enough power for civic roads, thanks Mitsubishi for standard stability control! In its price range Eclipse GT has no close competitors, you'll get most for your money."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Melvin , 04/07/2008,You must get one!,5,"Love the car. Sexy style, fun to drive, hot sound system, what's not to like? If you are thinking about getting one just do it! I am 6 feet tall and there's enough room."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Nicole, 05/10/2008,Amazing!,4,"Although I haven't bought the car yet, I have to say the two days I test drove it, I was so impressed.  I currently own a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am and have always loved the sportier cars and have to say the Eclipse is pretty amazing.  The get up and go is awesome, def. more torque than my grand am and the sound system is pretty awesome too.  I'm getting the green/silver/blue color and think it's a very classy choice.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,T. Currall, 10/17/2016,Awesome Car. Great Value !!,5,"You want to buy this car in the GT level.  Super great value and attractive car.  It's very reliable and a pleasure to own.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,lchhan, 07/07/2006,My Review,4,"My Blue Eclipse GS model is not bad for those looking to drive and have fun at the same time.  It is really nice around the corners and it has a smooth ride.  It gets people's attention when crusing the streets.  Also, the guages are really nice to look at when checking your speed.  The seats are comfy, too."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,BRIAN, 09/08/2006,"Fun, Fast, and Turns Heads",4,"The 2007 Eclispe is the best car I have ever driven, at the ripe old age of 45. I love the handling, the sylish look, as well as the speed of a 4-banger!  I feel young and get the young ladies looking!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Piano Man, 11/08/2006,2006 Eclipse GT Gas a Holic,3,"This is my third Eclipse and its flair seemed to fade less than two months after purchase.  Its fuel economy rating is not even close to its EPA estimates though.  I enjoyed my 1994 and 2002 models much more and am look to trade this gas guzzler before the end of the year.  The styling is truly unique, so unique that it will be out of style faster than ever.  The special ""aero"" kit required three adjustments and because it is difficult to see the front and back end, scraping curbs are unavoidable.  The steering and brakes are great, and so is the acceleration, but like an amusement park ride it is time to leave for something else."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,DV, 01/12/2010,Eh...,4,"Came from Honda's and Acura's so this was somewhat of a let down as far as build quality goes - interior has some rattles - brakes squeaked at first - paint quality is terrible - clear coat is coming off already on my bumper. Exterior design is great except for the hideous wheel well gap you can fit a small body into - what's the deal with Mitsu and their big wheel wells on eclipses?? As of right now, so long as I don't have any major issues and she doesn't leave me stranded, I'm happy. Going forward though, I'm gonna stick with what I know and that's Honda.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,deb, 07/23/2009,I will not buy another Mitsubishi,3,"The 2007 eclipse has 2 problems: some of the models sunroofs do not open all the way (mine does not) and my air conditioner has not worked properly and the dealership does not resolve my issue, only makes excuses. I will not buy another Mitsubishi; their engineers do a poor job in my opinion and that of the service rep I spoke with. BEWARE! "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,bsant, 08/19/2006,Great Understated Car,5,"On a long trip or short hop the 2007 Eclipse is just pure fun. I lose few stereo wars with its Fosgate 650W stereo and no off the line acceleration.  It is almost on par with the 2006 Mustang GT, which is faster than their previous GT.  I also looked at the Nissan 300Z and Mazda RX-8.  They are overpriced for what you get.  The 2006 'Stang GT is also overpriced when you compare it to the Eclipse's features side by side and plus everyone has one. This car is also a real ""head turner."" ' I have been on eleven hour straight drives up steep mountain passes and flat praries, the car is just a pleasure to be in and has amazing power when you need it to pass.  It is worry free. I also garden and can haul a couple of 1.7 cu ft dirt bags and many plants in one go. What a great Car! Also, it eats BMW 3-Series off the line easily."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,JB, 08/11/2009,"Beautiful, affordable, good not great",4,"The negatives on this vehicle are interior space.  Hardly any back seat.  Not good for extremely tall people.  I am 6'4"" and fit very snugly.  Worst is severe blind spots.  Very low to the ground.  Handles very well.  Average fuel economy for 4 cyl.  Decent acceleration/power. Always been reliable.  Speaker in trunk eliminates some storage space."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Aaron Parks, 01/28/2020,Value Performance,4,"At this point, this car has been around for a minute... we’ll see if I can add anything of value to this review. 

First off, it goes forward REALLY fast!  HOWEVER, the turning radius is pretty bad. You definitely need to enter every parking lot with a bit of pre-meditated strategy. 

Second, it is a surprisingly practical 2 door!  I can fit all of my drums in the back if I fold down the back seats.  The cargo space is pretty big for a car of its size. 

Third, the cost of ownership is okay. It takes premium gas; however, I haven’t had to fork over a ton of money for maintenance. 

The dash is starting to peel away because the glue is starting to lose its adhesiveness. It looks kind of bad. 

For an aging performance car, it’s a good value.  I put many a 350z to shame (with after market parts). With the stock parts, it still has enough power to keep you entertained!

It's not really a Sports car but its act like it. Sound System, design, Wheels, All around is good car. I did some long trips and very comfortable. It has more room then TC, Tibron for back seats, and really its an Head turner. I bought in 4 cyl. wish bought it in 6 cyl. and 6 speed Manual. Next Time. So if you like style Modifications Oh yes! Forget about Honda, Toyota, Get this one with 10 years of warranty... wowo... see you around.   "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,justinr321, 12/17/2008,"2007 GS Automatic, sun and sound package",4,"Bought the car back in November. Traded in a 07 Mustang for it and I'm glad I did. The car is pretty peppy for an inline 4 and gets great gas mileage (I usually averaged about 30 mpg). It has a cool design and interesting interior. It's also pretty comfortable as well. I did, however, wreck mine about 3 weeks ago and totaled it. It held up very well but the airbags didn't deploy, strangely enough. Overall, I liked the car and would recommend it for someone who is looking for an affordable, sporty car that gets good gas mileage."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Brian, 01/30/2007,Awesome Ride,4,"The 2007 Eclipse is an awesome ride. It has the styling of a small speedster, the beauty of a classic sports hatchback, and the get up and goes of a roadster. The 6-cyl. 24 valve, 263 HP engine, provide plenty of power to rock the road. Do not hesitate to take it for long drives. The car hugs the road with my all season Toyo Proxes FZ-4. Its ride is very comfortable "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,hahmed87, 04/03/2007,Steel Blue Mitsu,4,"I love the color that I got. The car is pretty quick for a GS. I like the style of the body, and most definitely love the interior light. I love the sub they included and plan on putting in my own."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,mrfagan68, 04/22/2008,"Great car, Great price",4,"I bought this car used with only 15,000 miles on it.  Used to be a rental.  I absolutely love the body.  The interior is great, mostly at night with the blue interior lights.  The car draws lots of attention, thank God this comes standard with security.  Surprised to find such power in a 4 cylinder.  I test drove a 6 cylinder, the extra pick up was better but not enough to make me want it.  The 6 also requires premium gas and when purchasing this, gas was definitely an issue.  The gas mileage is okay if you're not running and gunning.  I love the way the engine sounds and the handling is pretty good.  I like the fact that there is more room than in the older models."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,A, 05/06/2008,Don't drive to work,3,"From the day I bought the car, I just liked it, not loved it.  I didn't buy it for the gas mileage, so I wasn't expecting good mileage.  The power was fun (manual makes it better), but I notice all the other things like the blind spot, rough ride and road noise.  To top it off, when I took the car in for a shimmy while braking, I was told that it is normal for the rotors to have to be resurfaced every 10,000 miles.  So have fun with the car, just don't use the brakes."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2007,Rob, 05/11/2008,Eclipse '07 GS,4,"Purchased as a first car for my daughter but I'm driving it more than she.  Every time I drive it I'm more impressed.  Today I drove a combination of interstate and U.S. Rt 1 from Richmond, VA to D.C. in heavy downpours and lots of standing water  with my wife and daughter onboard and felt in control at all times.  Always looking for an excuse to drive.  Peppy, sporty ride and handling, great braking, tight steering, just overall fun to drive. Lots of compliments on styling with the sunset color.  Weird because I was looking for BMWs when my daughter talked me into driving it.  The price was $500 more than Kelley Blue Book TRADE IN with the balance of a 6 year, 60,000 mile warranty."

They were going 75 (the speed limit on this hwy).  They both walked away with minor scratches.  THANK YOU Mitsubishi for your excellent car - it saved my kid's life.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,argentum, 09/08/2007,We Love It But There Are Problems,4,"This car reminds me in some ways of the pony cars of yesteryear. It's heavy, wide and long and low to the ground. But of course it's way better. The 6 cyl is more responsive than most of the old 8s. The car handles far more sweetly and the inside is quiet. Even though the ride is tight, its not too hard. And all around mpg is always over 20. There are problems though. During fairly hard cornering on right turns there is a noise from the left side that sounds like a blown cv joint. Slowing down at highway speeds produces some serious vibration especially in the steering wheel.Interior fit and finish is awful."

I get compliments everywhere I go syaing how nice the car it and how it's perfect for me. Ity's has great speed on the highway which I love, but the pick-up is a little slow. It's excellent on gas (which is a plus at these prices). Its warms up fast in cold weather, but fishtails a little in the snow (which I do not like). Overall, for the price, it's worth it. I love it a great deal. A few little adjustments and it would be perfect!!!!! I recommend it."

I was skeptic at first but when I test drove the thing damn that thing hauls. I'm glad I got that Eclipse GT. Def get the GT V6 not the 4 banger cause then you'll be missing out on all the fun. The cars got speed its quick and peels out which to me is a good thing lol. You just gotta know how to drive it if you don't want it peeling out when you need it. The exhaust and engine sound good too and the rims are nice. Def. great car to buy
mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,fiveskin, 05/15/2008,"Big Engine, Sloppy Car",3,"This was engineered as more of a pretty car than a useful one. It weighs too much for a sport coupe(>3500 lb), the turning circle is ridiculously wide (40 ft) and that's pretty much SUV territory. It also has numerous blind spots such as wide pillars and tiny side windows. The side mirrors are also too small. You will definitely have problems parking this car in a tight space. There is a noticeable under steer. The interior also suffers from cheap looking materials even with the leather option. The plastics are all over the place such as the door handle and middle dash, it almost feels like you're sitting in a toy-car. The rear seat is expectedly only useful for storage. It needs a new design."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,EclipseOwner, 07/25/2007,Best Buy!,5,"I purchased a 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS with the sportronic transmission. My Eclipse has the 650 watt Rockford Fosgate sound system which is excellent.  I have had the car for 3 weeks now and it is an amazing car, it is fast even with the 4 cylinder and gets 31 mpg. It has a surprisingly spacious interior and I'm 6 foot 1 so it has a large cabin. The car is very easy to take care of and is a great buy. I used to have a 2006 Eclipse but I was in an accident in April that totalled it. The Eclipse is extremely safe because in my accident I was in a head on collision with a Cadilac Escalade and I was completely safe."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,chris, 08/23/2008,All around great car,4,"I am very happy with my purchase, car has been flawless so far. Great performance for the money and awesome styling. Visibility is a major problem though. Car also likes to get silly when pushed hard in corners when flooring it. Car should have at least came with a LSD or AWD. Interior also should have higher quality. Although nice enough for most people the interior materials don't belong on a 30K car. All around Great buy with a lot of potential. Just with a CAI performance and engine sound is night and day. In the end you get a little more than what you pay before."

I got the SE edition that includes the sunroof and the awesome Rock Ford Fosgate sound system (includes a subwoofer in the trunk).  It also has the nifty front and rear spoilers that makes the appearance very sharp.  So far I can tell a big improvement between this car and my truck I owned.  I am very glad to have purchased this vehicle.  :)"

Fun to drive, corners well, 4 cylinder is plenty fast. Excellent sound system, leather seating is a bit stiff but overall comfort is fine. Very quiet interior, which reminds me of a cockpit of a race car! Must know how to drive this vehicle as there are plenty of blind spots. Pricing is modest, the warranty is one of the best out there, period! Not to mention the safety features are incredible, what with 6 air bags and steel- reinforced doors. Overall, what a beautiful vehicle at a very affordable price! Mitsubishi and Toyota are one in the same as far as value vehicles."

I have the V6 GT SE, so mine has a few more bells & whistles than most.  It's a fun ride, not great in the snow, but not a death trap either.  I threw an intake on it to give it a bit more oomph and a nice engine sound.  With a few mods this will be a beast.  Stock, it's definitely a solid buy."

All were nice cars if you are 5'4 and weigh 98 pounds. At 6'1"" I found the Eclipse the easiest to get in and out of. The exterior styling of this cars is sleek and sexy. Back seat room is non existent but honestly, who really cares. Seats are comfortable enough. The non turbo V6 is strong with lots of torque and surprising little torque steer which makes for lots of acceleration fun. It doesn't have road rally/oval track curve hugging  ability that the Evo or Vette has but for everyday around town and nimble freeway driving it is great fun and hard to beat. "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,ChrisGT, 01/02/2008,A Tiger in Disguise,4,"Like a Tiger waiting to pounce, the Mitsubishi Eclipse GT, matches the same poise and agility. Cool and calm, it meanders through traffic, maintaining a firm grip on virtually any surface, but when the moment arises, can leap into the forefront, leaving others wondering ... what was that????  A head turner, it's exterior is quite unique to the market, and heralds the same design quality that made the Porsche 911 back in 1962.  Interior wise, all the ameneties point to the driver, assuring a comfort level that is always within arms reach.  To date, Mitsubishi has remained true to it committment in support of their products. For a re-design, it is quite impressively put together."

I have never been happier with my car, it's stylish enough for me and affordable, gets good gas mileage in my opinion, and is a smooth ride and yes I'll admit I've had it at its max 155 on a interstate, it rides very smooth even at that speed. If only it didn't have so much weight in it. 3550 lbs is a lot for a sports car and makes cornering devastating on your tires unless you take them extremely slow. Corning can use some work but even my last Eclipse turned like a Semi-truck so I'm used to it. All in all, I love my car and it attracts attention."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,mamiya, 02/02/2008,Likes & Dislikes Eclipse 08 2.4 auto,3,"500 miles so far, like looks, handling, fosgate sound, tires, int looks, DISLIKE noisy engine and interior like there's no sound dampening, maybe that's why they offer the 650 watt stereo! Hate the fact that if you get a flat you can't use flatfix, it will screw up the tire sensors!, and the key thing with the electronic code, it's like they want you to call for help!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,sandy57, 08/14/2007,What a car!,4,I bought the Sunset Pearl GT V6 with terra cotta interior.  What a beautiful car!  I got every option available and also got the Fosgate speaker package with sub in rear.  This car is solid and I get lots of compliments.  So far the gas mileage isn't that bad.  I am just getting used to the car.  Overall this is a great car for the money. It is really fun to drive.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2008,sportbiker3, 03/19/2008,Overall a good vehicle,4,"Had the vehicle for about 3 weeks now and overall I am very happy with it. V6 engine is powerful.  Exterior styling is unique and gets lots of attention, especially with the SE package. Also love the interior ""ice blue"" dash lights.  Only have a few small complaints. The satellite radio does not display artist/song information like it does in my other vehicles!! And the little blue light that comes on when you turn the highbeams on is way too bright and is annoying to the driver... no way to dim that light with the dash controls."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Chas, 01/30/2010,Love this car,4,"This car is the best performance and style value on the market.  I looked at many others before deciding on the Eclipse GT Spyder.  This car is hands down the most fun to drive for the money you can buy. Why this car doesn't get more respect from the ""Professional Reviewers"" is beyond me.  Buy one, you will love it!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Mulberrygal, 08/06/2009,Last Hurrah,4,"I have had 9 Nissans in a row, mainly Sentras. I was not happy with the new look they came out with so I checked Mitsubishi. One look at the 2009 Eclipse and I was in love. I am a grandma but not ready for the rocker. This car is fast becoming my favorite ever. Hot looking, (rave red) fun driving, didn't empty my trust fund to buy it and has one of the best warranties going. I am finding reasons to go out and drive it. My car insurance only went up $60 a year from my 2006 Sentra. How could you not love this car? "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Rob, 03/25/2010,Love at first sight!,4,This car is awesome. The price was great! Especially for a car of this year and miles it came with. Before deciding to go for the Eclipse I looked at the Mustang and the Honda Accord Coupe but both these car lose in looks and Warranty. I'm thankful I bought this car even though its the GS model it comes with many standard features. It drives like a dream very fast and peppy for a 4cyl engine. Miles per gallon are okay considering the weight of this vehicle and the safety features. Great car for the money!
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,ken, 09/20/2008,I love my car,5,Great car.  Handles like a much more expensive sports car with sporty styling.  Great acceleration for a 4 cylinder and truly a fun drive.  It is a 2 door hatchback that makes you excited to go anywhere.  I couldn't be happier with it.
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,David, 06/12/2009,About My Eclipse,5,"Drives very well, especially if have driven a manual before. Gas mileage is good 20-21 mpg in the city so far, haven't taken it out on a long drive. If you know how to shift properly you'll get better gas mileage and also know how to down shift to extend life on your brakes. I also have a motorcycle and that has helped me drive a manual transmission better. If you're complaining about your gas mileage it's because you're probably not shifting at the right RPMs. It could have used a few more compartments to place items maybe behind the seats etc.; other then that a very good vehicle. I love my car!!!!!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,ilikemoney3, 04/20/2014,Beautiful Car,4,"This car is pretty nice to have it is fun to drive but not the best unfortunately. I wanna start with the pros of this car. Looks are sharp! I mean my kalapana black eclipse turns heads all the time and gets me solid compliments. Its a nice little 4 banger perfect for me and my chick. Installed HID 8000k lights, LED interior and License plate LED,
modded exhaust, and Cold Air Intake."
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Nick, 01/21/2009,Good value,4,"I haven't seen a better combination of performance, looks, and price than the 09 Eclipse GT.  It has more hp than the other cars in it's class, looks better (in my opinion), and in many cases is less expensive than other cars that less to offer.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Mike Ferrugi, 03/30/2016,Slick Ride,4,"The only negative about this vehicle is that even with the air temp dial at max cool, there is a tremendous amount of warm air coming in through the vent around the petals.  I suspect that the outside air duct must run close to the exhaust and they pick up temperature from that and it is the sent into the car.  To avoid this I engage the interior circulation mode, which eliminated the air flow.  Also, the vehicle does oversteer or plow when making hard turns.

It is a very comfortable and enjoyable car for long distance driving.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,rayhallnc, 03/20/2010,Great Driving Sportscar,4,Lots of power and handles very well. GT with the rear fin gets a lot of looks and even questions as to what kind of car it is.  Read other comments and noted concerns about the short distance of the low beams. There is a switch on the dash to adjust this. I panicked the 1st night I drove mine.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Kenneth, 11/12/2008,2009 Eclipse V6 GT,4,"Runs smooth, good price with great power. 20 average MPG is reasonable with its horse power.  The 650W audio w/ subwoofer is really amazing! Good audio.  The truck is hard to close. Have to bang it real hard.   "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Delissa, 03/25/2009,Love this car!,5,"Two weeks ago we traded our 2006 Eclipse GT in on a 2009 Eclipse GT.  I really like the looks of the dual exhaust.  Our old Eclipse had the automatic transmission and this time we opted for the 6-speed standard.  It seems to have so much more power than the automatic.  I don't know if they have made the back window larger, but it seems easier to see behind you when backing.  I feel sure we will enjoy the sun-roof when the weather is nicer and the Rockford-Fosgate stereo absolutely rocks! I love this car and think I'm hooked on Eclipses forever!"
mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,Susan, 04/27/2009,Fun to drive,4,"This is the 2nd eclipse that I have owned.  I love this car.  I have had many sporty cars but this car is the most fun to drive.  I love the way it handles corners.  My only criticism is that I wish they could make the front end a little bit sportier.  I love the front of the Mazda RX-8.  I wish this front had more style like that but overall, a hot car that drives great. It's amazing in the snow.  People are always shocked to hear this but it's the truth.  If you want a fun, reliable car, I highly recommend the Eclipse."

mitsubishi,eclipse,2009,3g eclipse, 08/22/2020,Great find - used 2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT,5,"I previously had a 1st and a 3rd generation eclipse and always liked the styling of the 4th generation, specifically the 2009, 2010 and 2011 model years with the HID headlights and the rear spoiler. It is 2020 and just purchased a used 2009 GT in great condition. This car is so fun to drive. The engine sounds good. The exhaust note sounds good. And the car just goes. The brakes are also strong on this car. Handling is excellent compared to most normal cars and the body style looks fantastic. There are a few downsides. The car is quite noisy at highway speeds, and the vehicle does not have any of the latest features that come with new vehicles in 2020, such as a quiet & smooth ride, led headlights, hd radio, cell phone connectivity, large display screen, back-up camera, etc but has that classic fun-to-drive experience.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2011,dteezy, 11/03/2013,I love my eclipse.,4,"I am a young male who is freshly 21, and was in the market for a coupe to replace my troublesome 2002 Nissan Altima. I've always wanted an eclipse. So I found a 2011 Eclipse GS Sport on autotrader, and to my surprise, it was fully loaded (leather, heated seats, backup camera, bluetooth, sirius satellite, aux, 6 disc, moonroof, xenon headlights, fog lights, etc) WITH ONLYYYY 30,000 Miles!!! It was sooo affordable, & Im so happy I got this. I am 5""10, and I pretty much have to search for a comfortable position, but when I do, it is well worth it. The 4 cylinder is really fast or for performance at all, hence 4 cylinders. but the ride is smooth, quiet, controlled, and feels glued to the road."

Looked at them all but for the price and fuel ecom. this was the best for the the price--no question. Have had many from Corvettes to Cobalt SS's but for a 12 month car I think this was a good choice with front wheel drive. Just remember it's more show than go, but it does handle real well.  "
mitsubishi,eclipse,2011,tbeirlair, 01/04/2011,2011 Mitsubishi Eclipse gs 5speed,4,I bought this 2011 Eclipse when they came out in August 2010. I own a 2003 and 2005 eclipse also. I think they're great cars. Very reliable. The 2011 I bought handles great and shifts smooth. It's fun yet practical. I do have a problem with Mitsubishi and how they're packages are set up. You can't have any options with the manual. It must be an automatic to have anything in it. And you can't have a manual v6? It doesn't make sense to me and I think they're going to lose alot of business doing this. Other than that. I highly recommend this eclipse. It's a great car. Mitsubishi has great deals and awesome warranties. Lets just hope we can have luxury and a manual in the next generation eclipse

With a 10 inch bass cannon behind the back seat, the neighbors here us when we come and go. Lots of nice features with this car.

mitsubishi,eclipse,2012,Janice Kahn, 06/09/2017,Mitsubish Eclipse,3,"This car was listed as an automatic but it's a stick shift.   It made a horrible noise when I was driving it and the salesman said they'd have the shop look at it.  Although listed with blue tooth, there is no blue tooth.  Although listed with a sun roof, there was no sun roof. The stick shift's numbers were all rubbed off.  The salesman suggested I write them back on.  The car looked well enough cosmetically.  Just minor dings and scratches.  It was just ok, nothing special. The price was listed at one price and I was going to buy it buy they added on over $2000. for I don't remember what.  Bringing the price well over the original price.  When I told them that the price was listed much lower they gave me excuses but refused to lower it so I passed on it.  As I told them, it was a stick shift, when I wanted automatic, there was no blue tooth, so I'd have to change out the radio.  And the car was nothing special to purchase it at the price they wanted.  So I passed.

I have done a few upgrades and wow!, this v6 kicks but, but you gotta do a couple of things to wake the motor up. My ride has about 300 foot pounds of torque.

Bonus for the convertible top! And it's got a pretty comfortable back seat - hard to find that in a convertible. I have only had to make minor repairs in the 5 years I've had it. It's just a wonderful car, so much fun to drive, and I get a lot of compliments. I would recommend it to anyone."

This car should def be a 2 seater and what is going on with that trunk? Can't really fit anything that can't fold in there. The second cup holder inside the middle console was a horrible idea.

I've had the clutch master cylinder go out on me, but it wasn't a big deal to replace. Overall, I have to say this car has treated me well, parts aren't hard to find and are relatively cheap, when you actually need them anyway. It's a great, fairly cheap option as a sports car, not quite as fast as other cars, but other features more than make up for it, and it will out-handle more than its fair share. Enjoy it as I have."

just towed by AAA to Mitsubishi dealer

defects, such as:
Had to put bushings on rear axle do to 
crackling noise
Problems with front brakes causing 
loud popping sounds.  

RIMS cracking even though haven't hit 
anything and Mitsu won't admit to it.  
Hoping NHTSA will live  up to it 
responsibility and require a recall.
Just look at number of recalls and 
TSB's on NHTSA site to see the quality 
of this car is horrendous.
and last is the DEPRECIATION.  This 
car took a big drop in depreciation 
last year and now I know why. 

Won't buy Mitsu again because of all 
of the above"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2001,silver surfer, 09/01/2003,BIG BANG! (for the buck),5,"The Spyder handles great, picks up 
quick, is easy on the eyes and not too 
costly (to purchase or drive). My very 
first car was ""66 Mustang GT w/ a 3 
speed 289. Since then I've driven tons 
of musle cars: Chargers,Road 
Runners,Cobras,Novas,Cudas GTOs and 
many others over my 25 years+ and I 
gotta say, the Spyder while not as 
powerfully built as those past bangers 
it is just plain more fun! It's almost 
too easy to drive At 5' 10"" the cock-
pit fits me well. It's very comfortable 
with the controls easily accessable.

I have to say that they never gave me the type of trouble this car has given me. The car has cost me so much money in repairs it's ridiculous. So far I have had a rear differential pressure sensor short which cost about $500 to replace, a center speaker blow, a total new set of rims because they bend so easily (they are cheap and the new ones have already begun to bend at the edges), an instrument panel and center stack light burn out, and a fog lamp replaced. To add injury to insult, the rear differential pressure sensor blew because of a Mitsubiahi dealer mechanic leaving off the radiator hose!"

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2001,sam, 08/14/2006,2001 Eclipse Spyder GT,5,"I was never a ""big fan"" of the body style change of the Eclipse in 2000, but I must say the Spyder still looks good.  It is fun to drive and will get looks everywhere you go (and I'm not just saying that). With the top up it maintains a very sleek low profile. I have a burgundy GT with the tan top, which is very stylish.  The version GT with the 3.0L engine is a must!  Its gas mileage is almost exactly the same as the smaller engine (1 mile per gallon difference) so why skimp? The tiptronic auto is the best of both worlds, auto for in town and switch it to manual when it's time to have some fun. I highly recommend the car if you are looking for a convertible with extra seating.  The rear seats might be a little tight, just hope for small kids."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2001,DragFish, 02/27/2008,Nice Car,5,"Since I purchased my car back in March I have enjoyed it. I love just dropping the top during the day, driving through the city and just watching all the girls waving and smiling at me. The performance is wonderful. I have a friend that drives a mercury cougar with a 4.6L V8 sohc engine with a performance chip installed who thought he could beat me and I beat him at the strip by half a car length and the only thing I've added to the car performance wise is a cold air intake. It's the first car I've ever had and I'll probably keep it around for a while."

Convertible is one of the most fun 
vehicles I have ever had the 
opportunity to own and drive. The 200 
hp V6 engine with a 5 spd manual 
transmission has more than enough 
power. It accellerates rapidly at 
higher rpm. It launches from 60mph to 
100mph in 4th gear with ease. I've 
driven up mountain roads in Tennessee 
at 130mph with the top down and had a 
blast. The precise steering handles 
sharp curves easily. At 6'2"" I have 
plenty of leg room. The interior 
styling looks great from the drivers 
seat and I love driving this car."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2001,Mike, 07/10/2020,Straight forward convertible,4,"It’s a very cool looking car but it is very limited in modern technology, even for a 2001. It doesn’t have tire pressure sensors, mpg sensor, doesn’t make noise if your not wearing a seatbelt. You’re gonna want to upgrade the sound system because it is very “2001” with a cd/cassette player am/fm radio.  I’m 6’2 and out of all the coupes I have driven before this one is probably the most comfortable. With that being said you’d be lucky to fit one person in the back seat comfortably. It’s a sports car so it has the power you need but if you’re looking for a lot of it there isn’t a lot here. It does handle well but unless you upgrade everything like tires and coil overs and what not don’t go out and hit turns going 50 mph these cars are old enough to vote and something will break or worse. When you’re buying them you should be able to find one with 60,000 miles on it or more anything lower than that be sure to do a background check on the car. I found one with with 25,000 miles and it was rolled back a few times according to car facts. I had to change the roof on the car there was a really bad leak whenever it rained. Overall I am very happy with the car I was even happier when I got a sound system with Apple car play and I plan on keeping the car until it doesn’t wanna go anymore.

MAJOR complaint.the rims on this car 
are very susceptible to even the 
slightest potholes. i have had this 
car for less than a DAY, and already 
need to replace a dented/cracked rim 
from a minor pothole i hit. NHTSA has 
had a number of complaints about these 
rims. Mitsubishi is not willing to 
recall these rims, stating it isn't a 
problem, but the interesting thing is, 
why did they change the suspension and 
rims for the 2003 model if the 2002 
was fine? so my advice, is get the 
2003 if you have a choice and save 
yourself from needing to buy $350 rims 
the first time you hit a pothole, 
railroad tracks etc.   "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,SpyderGt, 12/22/2006,Great car for the money!,4,"I bought the car with 43,000 miles on it. The only problems I had were with the AC not cooling (it needed servicing - $600 for ""the works"") and a bad battery (I bought top of the line at Sears for $120).  The engine light was on due to a bad PCV solenoid and now it is good to go. Otherwise the car is fun to drive and looks cool. I don't know why Mitsubishi changed the model to the ugly looking new one. The new one looks like a souped up Avalon."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,matt6862, 11/15/2007,Eclipse Spyder GT,4,Great car at a great price.  Unsure when I bought whether or not it was the right car for me but it has eliminated all doubts.  I'm from Wisconsin and it handles superbly in the snow.  
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,ddouka, 03/26/2002,2003 Spyder GTS,4,"Yep, I just purchased a 2003 Spyder GTS on March 22, 2002.  This had been on the lot for only 5 days.  The styling is beautiful and turns heads wherever I go.  The 6-disc, 210 watt in-dash CD has a great sound.  The car came with virtually every option and priced out in excess of $30,000.  The 17"" wheels give it a great look.  The top moves up and down very nicely.  The boot is a bit cheap, but looks better than having nothing.  Performance is adequate and steering response is very good.  I find the drivers seat very comfortable with good headroom."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,jlj6670, 12/24/2005,Fun Car,4,"The Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder is a fun car to drive, but no one ever likes to ride in it.  Tall people beware - it is very uncomfortable.  It has good pick up when you need it.  However it is very costly to repair or maintain.  I seem to need new tires all the time because of the low air pressure and the tires are very costly.  Also, the rims bend too easily which affect the tires.  I like the ease of use of the convertible top."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,VJT, 09/30/2005,Like It as Much as the First Day I Bought It,5,"My Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder has been a fun car.  It is a good combination of power and pleasure.  It keeps up with the other cars in it's class speed-wise and it just looks cool.  People still watch these cars go buy with envy. It has blind spots, but no worse than the other convertibles that I looked at, the Honda S2000 is just as bad.  Besides this is only a problem in parking lots, not everyday driving. I love the ""manual"" automatic transmission. I've had no mechanical problems, fortunately."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,Shizz, 03/25/2002,"A great car, for a great price.",4,"Performance: Now the 3g Eclipse may not be a top notch performer, but it is pretty good.  Especially since it actually has torque compared to some other imports.  Compared to the old Eclipses though, with AWD and a turbo, the new Eclipse lacks.  There is some aftermarket for the new eclipse coming out though.

Comfort:  VERY comfortable!

Fun to drive:  Yeah it is fun to drive, but feels a bit like a sedan.

Interior Design:  A bit boring, but it beats the Mustang at least.

Exterior Design: You either hate it or like it.  The pictures of it don't give it much justice, up close the car looks ten times better in my opinion."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,a fun ride, 03/15/2002,fun and stylish,4,"At least to my eyes, the eclipse spider is one of the best looking cars on the road.  The powerful engine, tight transmission, and well-tuned suspension also make it amazingly fun to drive.  But this car really comes into its own when you hit the button to automatically retract the top- one test drive with the top down and I was sold.   This convertible top is very well designed and allows far more headroom in the rear than does the hardtop eclipse (although legroom in the back is still non-existent unless you push the front seats ALL the way forward).   If pure performance was the only goal,  I would have gone with the Suburu WRX.  But it wasn't and I didn't."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2002,Julia mashburn, 03/21/2007,2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GS,4,"I just recently purchased this car.  It is fun to drive. It also is colored a Pearl White.

The interior is brown cloth.  The car only has 35,000 miles on it. The topper is beige. The driving experience has been so fun. It rides really smoothly and the gas pedal is very sensitive.  That means you will be bugging down the road and not realize it.  The gas mileage for this car is about 25 mpg. The battery has just started to leak, I think the wires were it charging too much.  It holds one CD at a time and has a radio."

convertibles I have owned, e.g., the 
BMW Z3.  The size is more accomodating, 
but design features such as the huge 
right blind-spot and the raised door 
jambs make this car a little 
uncomfortable.  Handling is good and 
tight, as a sports cars should be.  
However, gas mileage on my particular 
car is lower than I have experienced on 
similar vehicles/engines.  All in all, 
a fun mid-level car that is probably a 
few thousand dollars too expensive

Now mind you this isn't a 300GT V/R4 (I owned one of those!! YOW!) or the fantastic EVO, it still holds it's own! There are also plenty of after market parts for it so personalizing it is a fun way to go!

I have the 5 speed manual tranny, and this thing has some JUICE, to the point where, despite having been through 2 fender benders with no repairs other than cosmetics, still beats the faster 2007+ mustangs and ricer hondas/nissans/scions. Oh, my 03 eclipse is completely 100% totally stock. It now has 178k miles and not only runs brand spankin' new but still beats new cars in accel. contests.

In the last 2 months it been in the shop 6 times to the tune of 4000 dollars in repairs.  I've had to replace the engine (no warranty) and now the computer is all over the place, turning off components such as the AC as it pleases. The car is awful in extreme heat! AC kills all horsepower. The top no longer works electrically. Just awful. If you plan on only putting only 5k a year in miles, then maybe buy it"

Had to replace factory brakes with some better ones as the rotors kept warping but since I usually drive 75-80 that may have been my driving habits.  NOTHING has broken in the car, paint hasn't held up very well but it isn't rusting so I can't complain.  The car is still as fun as the day I bought it.  With Sportronic and leather this car is as nice as cars costing twice as much.  Also own an Audi TT and if I were shopping tomorrow, I would be at Mitsubishi, not Audi.

I'll have this car for a long time.  The only draw back that I can see is the spoiler when the top is up, it creates even more blind spots. I also live where it snows A LOT, and would be nice to have side mirrors that defrost like my old VW Golf.  I don't seem to have problems with the turning radius that many people do, and have fixed most of the blind spot issues with placing a small round mirror on the side mirror.  I have a 4-cylinder engine with the standard transmission and the acceleration is great.  Given the chance I would buy another one tomorrow and tell anyone looking for a new car to check this one out."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,dmp225, 12/11/2003,Fun...but,3,"I have had so much fun driving this 
car..but there are a few problems.  
First. it loses value very quickly.  I 
put 25000 miles on it in one year and 
it is worth about half of what I paid 
for it.  The front end (under the 
car) ""bottoms out"" very easily and gets 
damaged.  Tires wear quickly, and the 
insurance is a lot of money.  But it is 
a reliable car..but not for the long 
run."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,MGL, 01/21/2006,Still Love it Like When it Was New,4,I fell in love with the style when this version of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder came out.  The front stylying was like a mini  Jaguar.  Just a fine style package.  It has never been in the shop for any repairs after 3 1/2 years.  this car is a perfect runner that still turns heads. Its quality has been excellent. It is a great car for function and fun.                                                            
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,elman1952, 02/25/2007,Great Fun!,4,"I bought my previously owned Spyder from a dealer, after driving the same model as a rental.  It is a really fun vehicle to drive, with semi-automatic 4 speed transmission and powerful V6 engine.  It handles very well.  I had a transmission fluid leak repaired, but that is the only mechanical problem I've encountered.  I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a fun sports car convertible.  Warning:  This is NOT a comfortable vehicle for more than a driver and one passenger."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,Brett Roper, 05/18/2002,First Convertible,5,"After comparing many convertibles, we 
settled on a 2003 Spyder Convertible 
(auto) for several reasons, the highest 
on the list being headroom as I am 6' 
4"" and found virtually all other 
comparisons left much to be desired in 
roominess department.  Although it did 
not have the horsepower of some of 
those vehicles we looked at, it had the 
best combination of features and came 
in less than 30k which we had agreed to 
stay under.  We just got back from a 
Florida driving trip (1600 miles RT) 
and were very pleased with how un-
cramped and un-tired we were after an 8 
hour drive."

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,DT, 08/13/2005,My latest purchase,5,"I have wanted one of these since I first saw one.  I finally got a used one last weekend.  I like the handling of the car, although the turn radius is big. With the top up, the rear window is really small, and the rear quarter blind zones take some getting used to. However, I love the size of this car.  I am 6'2"", and I still feel like I have plenty of room.  I drove it about 100 miles on a highway at 70 with the top down, and didn't get blown away.  Good gas mileage, as I got 30 expressway on the way home.  This was the perfect car for me!"

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,Donnain PA, 07/24/2004,Great for the money,4,"I am happy with the interior of the 
car, body style with the exception of 
the blind spot.  Can fit 4 people, back 
seat is a little rough with the top 
down.
Must use Premium fuel.  This is my 
first sports(type)car and I am happy 
with it and have had it over a year 
now.  Great in the snow so far too!!
All leather and 6 disc stereo with 
controls on the steering wheel, make it 
about all I want. (though seat warmers 
would be nice) Even has a Trunk that 
fits the family groceries."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,Doug Perez, 11/10/2005,The best car I have ever owned.,5,"I had very specific requirements when I was looking for a car:  a convertible, a 4-cylinder engine, and enough room to get away for the weekend if you wanted to take a bag with you.  This left me with the Eclipse and the Ford Mustang, and yes, the Mustang has 6-cylinders.  The Eclipse has been flawless, and very fun to drive with the 4-cylinder engine.  I took it on the Blue Ridge Parkway a few weeks ago, and the girl I was with asked me to slow down at first until she realized how well the car hugged the corners, so she just sat back and enjoyed the ride.  Nothing has broken in three years, and people even tell me they still notice a hint of new-car smell.  The back seat is more comfortable than you'd think."

Traded out of a 2001 Nissan Max 20th SE 
with one year left on lease.

Pull out of the deal even on the trade 
and 2 dollars over invoice on the 
Eclipse.  

Most wonderful purchase exp of a car 
ever. They bent over backwards to get 
me into this car and had a great 
attitude towards making it work the 
whole time.

Well if you are considering buying  a spyder...!!! Do it.. kicking car that is top notch racer... pedal to the metal. No more to be said. Parts are cheap and car is easy to work on. I feel blessed. We say this car stays in the family. replacing parts are easy, I'm at 160 + and haven't had to replace anything. This car is badddd!!!!  They won't make a car like this again, I got mine at $2000 blue book because a small 1x2 unnoticeable slightly paint difference patch on hood. no big deal...with no motor / issues which is amazing, I am on here only to tell good people go go go! This is ticket to good car. Every review talks about the dash board being cracked.... whatever? Mine isn't thank God, but big deal.. the car rocks in every other aspect. It's the nicest car I've ever had at40 yrs old now and get compliments every day. If u like driving fast. I do. It's a contender with all new vehicle out there. And sounds like a jet landing when the motor slows down/ trans shifts. VByea people. no joke.

NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS it!! I'll make a 
long story short (unfortunately, this 
is the short version): The top leaks, 
after 2 1/2 years had to spend $1,000 
for a new top - and still have problems 
with it going back smoothly, the 
window/door lock controller ""box"" has 
fallen into the door panel (twice, @ 
$120 each repair), A/C went out ($450 
to replace), cam sensor went out @ 
around 40,000 miles & the car totally 
shut down ($200 expense). Along with 
the un-necessary repairs above, I have 
had this car towed a total of 9 times 
in the past 2 years....times that by 
$50 and you decide if buying the

I
use the auto transmission but it also came with a switch over to manuel transmission feature which I have not seen anywhere else yet but I know they do exists. I am looking for a truck now because of free range horse/cattle in my area. I will miss this car forever. Held up well in & out. I had avalanche truck -entire dash board circuitry went out-thanks for not letting me know chevy co! I will buy my new truck elsewhere! not like U couldn't find me duh!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,klowhorn, 08/16/2003,Can I get some power please?,3,"Traded a V6 Accord coupe with all 
options. Biggest mistake ever! This car 
is affordable, but no fun. If I could 
do it all over again I'd get aGTS 5-
speed, and then maybe I could get 
decent acceleration and around town 
drivability. I have to drive my GS with 
the manumatic constantly revving to 
6,000RPM and I still think it is slow. 
Build quality is okay, and the interior 
has too many cheap plastics. I had to 
buy an aluminum dash kit just
to dress it up. I'm going to keep the 
car, so I plan to add headers, a new 
exhaust, new intake and throttle body, 
and either a turbocharger or 
performance chip. It's the only way the 
car will be tolerable."

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,Wally, 01/19/2005,Affordable Price yet Costly Upkeep,3,"I bought my 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse for the sole purpose of having a fun convertible at an affordable price. I was disappointed to discover that I was visiting the gas station more often, especially with the impractical premium gas prices in California. But despite all that, I still enjoy the car and I think its very attractive. I get a lot of looks and girls definitely enjoy cruising with me in it. Another disappointment was the price for maintenance. In the service manual, it says to replace the spark plugs at 25,000 miles. Just the labor itself for 2.5 hours is about $200. That is not including the six spark plugs you have to buy for $20 each. I guess that is what a high performance engine calls for. This car Earns a B- in my book."

who cares because face it, the Spyder 
is a ""ME"" car..not a ""WE"" car. 
  The 6 CD in the dash system is 
fantastic.  the speakers can make 
everyone around you listen to what YOUR 
listening to. Does the wind mess up 
your hair? Front seat passengers all 
agree..NO. The windshield comes high

rainstorm on I95 with a tall adult 
passenger in the back seat went well. 
The fit/finish seem great and I've had 
no problems so far.
And, obviously it's great fun on a 
sunny day. Acceleration is good; 
handling is very good, nice 6-CD

was initially happy with it, but as 
time went on I became more and more 
frustrated with the very poor low-end 
HP and torque.  Sure, once ya get the 
thing about 4000 rpm, it pulls fairly 
well, but getting to that point is 
torture.  Mash the accelerator 
anything under 4000 rpm and the thing 
just dogs.  The car handles corners 
very well and is fun to drive in that 
aspect.  Another compliant is the 
awful turning radius.  By far the 
worst in that aspect of any car I have 
driven.  Any U-turn is impossible 
without having to backup at least 
once."

was it quick, but it was comfortable to

Have to agree with the comments from other reviews on turning radius, but for the number of times that issue comes up, it's not a problem to worry about."

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,silkstocken, 12/18/2005,My first love...,4,"I love this car. Its style is gorgeous, it's built well, it's just down right spiffy.  It hugs the road, is good in snow (compared to cars), has enough room for two or three people with one tiny person in the back, which is sort of small.  The only downfall I see is the lack of passenger space for more than two people. But, if your looking for a family car then obviously you don't buy this car.  The back seats serve more of a shoppers bag holder. This car is a must drive, its gas mileage is good and its body is strong.  It is the love of my life."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2003,thesaxman, 03/29/2003,a super fun sports car,4,"The 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GTS--
you have to drive this car to 
appreciate how incredibly ""creamy"" it 
is. That's how my wife describes 
everything about this car. From its 
smooth, powerful 210hp v6 and computer-
controlled sportronic auto/manual 
transmission to its great lines outside 
and inside. A great 4 passenger 
convertible-you have to check this out. 
Nice trunk, and the backseat is totally 
functional--don't let the Edmunds 
review mislead you.
Go straight to the fully loaded GTS 
model--you will not be sorry.
A fully loaded luxury sportcar for 
$28,465, about $1700 under sticker, and 
you can't argue with that 2.9% 
financing. Go for it."

I had actually just bought a Subaru when I saw this car and fell in love with it (it's the light green one.) So I traded in the subaru and never looked back. The only work I've had to do is replace the battery after 4+ years. Oh and the shocks at 40,000, but that's my fault, not the car's. I lived on a long, very washboard dirt road for 2 years and drove that road every day. I've never pampered my car, I've taken it camping, on dirt trails, everywhere - it's great!

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,lisag, 05/15/2006,Doesn't handle like a sports car,3,"The design is very good.  Convertible top operation is easy and quick.  Its handling however leaves a lot to be desired.  It is not very responsive especially for a sporty V6.  Its ride is acceptable for a sporty car.  The turning radius is terrible.  Large trucks have better turning capabilities.  The visibility is also very poor with the top up.  Given these two factors, backing out of a parking space is always a challenge."

First off, it's loud since it's a spyder. it interior and exterior are ok for a sports car of those years. reliability is awesome since its at almost 200k now. its fun and very stiff ride, you will feel all the bumps. You will also feel body roll and over steer when going around corner's fast.
The main problems I have with this car is 1 it's FWD which I'm not fond of, and 2 it's hard to find performance parts for."

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,Brian, 12/01/2006,Great Daily Driver,4,"I bought this car to go 70 miles each way to work in Northern NJ.  I wanted a convertible and I didnt need 350Z performance.  I wanted good gas mileage and a car that I could put gas in, change the oil periodically and otherwise forget.  I am 63 so a lot of other cars were out.  This car has been a very pleasant surprise.  I have had no problems with it and it has been fun to drive even in the worst traffic with the worst drivers on the planet.  It has decent pickup (GTS 5 Spd) and decent handling.  I bought it two years old with 20,000 miles and it came used with a better warranty than almost all US cars come with new.  The Eclipse Spyder is a great car if youre looking for a fun convertible to drive that doesnt need a lot of attention."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,Raymond, 04/07/2006,Dream Machine,4,"I traded a Nissan 350Z for this car if you can beleive it. The Z was a lousy daily driver. This is a perfect compromise. It has a smooth as silk ride, decent handling, great fuel economy, and looks awesome. Not to mention the top-down fun. This car is really fun to drive. I love this car. It is the second Eclipse that I have owned, and I love it as much as the first. This car is underrated! Buy one and fall in love!"

ride of any of our vehicles.  There is 
no problem with hydroplaning unlike 
previous cars I have owned.  The 
interior was designed with every thing 
at your fingertips and every thing I've 
ever needed in a car.  The backseat is 
small but my two kids fit back there 
comfortably(my oldest son is 5'5"").  
The top is very easy to operate and 
even if there was something else I 
didn't like about the Spyder the sporty 
look with the top down would have sold 
it. "

I found a really well kept and maintained Spyder. I bought it with 52,000 miles. This car is sound, pretty, and fun to drive. I'm good with the gas mileage. I love the style and with the top down its just plain sexy. I like the sound system and the gauges in the cockpit. I really like the bucket seats and the handling. This is my poor man's Ferrari. I plan on taking great care of this car. First up is the 60,000 mile maintenance. It will cost me around $1500 to do the timing belt, water pump, etc... But because this car is so damn fun and sexy I do not begrudge the maintenence in the least. I hope to keep this car running strong until she is a classic lol. Should be soon, within the next decade.

I test drove several used Eclipses, but thought they were over priced in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. When I drove the Spyder, I bought it fifteen minutes later. I've had it for almost six months now and love almost everything about it. I did get ripped off on the GPS Guidepoint system and the alarm which the dealer talked me into buying for $2,200 only to find later the coverage would cost me another $500 a year, and they tripled the price from what I could have got it for privately.  Also, the CD Player started skipping the second day.  "

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,Lunar Eclipse, 12/04/2003,Great Design... poor performance,4,"First off I will state i have been 
totally loyal to the Mitsubishi Eclipse 
Eclipse since the debut, and in fact I 
have owned nothing but Eclipse's 
starting with the 1993 Eclipse. The 
2004 is an awesome body style, 
definitly fun to drive. You will love 
all the looks you get on the street. 
However, Performance has become an 
issue. Acceleration is really a drag 
from a dead stop, and if you buy an 
automatic the gears shift a lil early 
for my taste, so i recommend buying the 
5-speed. So though i am proud to have 
bought it, i'd say over all I'm 
disappointed with this years Eclipse, I 
say go back to the second generation 
Eclipse..those were real cars."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,Lynn, 06/27/2005,Impulse buy,3,"We drove the car once and bought it.The car is nice looking and feels like a good car. It has not even been 1 year, we have had to replace a fuel pump (on our road trip in FL).  The lock never worked properly, the seatbelts always getting stuck. The passenger side seat needed to be fixed. When accelerating the car bucks and when we brought it in to be fixed on Saturday they did not have the tech. to fix the issue. This car has been one problem after the other. There definitely is not enough trunk space or room in the backseat. One adult in the backseat makes everyone uncomfortable in the car. Also the air conditioner has had to be recharged already. No grill on the front pulls debris directly into the engine."

tight and sticks to the road.  
Dropping the top couldn't be easier,

children as well as a baby girl and we 
all enjoy the ride. The lack of rear 
room has never been a problem for us.  
It's a beautifully designed car - 
exquisite!  Since I am not a real

with the 4 cylinder although I still

amounts of metal shards in the fluid. At
45,000 miles the car shook. Took it in
for a brake job but the dealer said it
was just the rotors so I would be good
for a few months before I would need to
actually pay for any work.. 2 weeks
later I was on interstate 95 and had
ZERO brakes. Yeah, I said ZERO. Used
""e-brake"" to make it to the dealers.
Dealer wanted $850 for a new caliper.
LOL!  PS. if you REALLY want this car,
buy a big warranty."

and 19.7 in. chrome wheels and low-
profile tires...it looks awesome in 
torched steel blue!  Infinity cd

most but I traded a car with Bose so 
that was a downgrade.  Putting the top 
down is so easy however with the top

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,wildwestexpress, 12/18/2004,Spyder Man...,4,"The 2004 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GT
is the first new car I have purchased in many years. 
I saw one on the road six months 
earlier and thought it looked awesome. 
I test drove and/or rented cars for 
four months before I went to the 
Mitsubishi dealer and bought this car. 
I've had it for three weeks.  I'm in 
California in the winter and it's 85 
degrees out, the top is down, and my 
daughter is with me. All is good!I love this car!
It handles awesome, has the power to get 
you out of trouble in LA traffic, good 
gas mileage, looks terrific, and it's a 
head turner. The only negative would be 
the trunk size and the rear seat 
size...but who cares!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,shauna, 01/02/2005,Nice Sporty Car,4,"I have had the car for about 6 months, 
and I have had no problems.  The 4 cyl. 
isn't powerful (as most aren't), but it 
is plenty of for me.  I'm not really 
hugging any curves on any huge 
mountains in Indiana, if you know what 
I mean?  There is a huge blind spot 
when the top is up.  You kindof have to 
look the best you can and pray.  The 
top goes up and down with ease, and you 
get a lot of attention in the car. 
About every week, I get a compliment on 
it."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,Raymond, 05/26/2006,Worth it!,4,"As shocking as it may sound, I traded a 350Z for this car because I wanted a drop top again and better comfort and fuel mileage. I bought this with 4,000 miles on the odometer (in 2006)!  The chrome blue on midnight is amazing, it looks awesome. This car has very comfortable front seats. I have never gotten less than 27 mpg CITY (mine is a 5-speed stick)!  It handles pretty well.  It rides like a Benz (trust me I know I work for them).  It has decent trunk space compared to the  '99 model that I had a few years back.  I am having issues with a phantom front suspension noise and a ""click"" in my clutch pedal, but the dealership has been very helpful.  I love this car.  I never thought I would like a car as much as I like this one. I highly recommend it! "

Did regular oil changes every 5,000 miles.  Very reliable car and fun to drive.  Update: The drive belt broke and had to be replaced at about 180K miles. Everything else still working A-OK.

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2004,Jack Demyan, 10/27/2017,Love this car.,5,"I have to say that the 2004 Spyder Gt Convertible I recently purchased is, without a doubt, the most enjoyable car I have ever owned.  This is 2017 and the previous owner took immaculate care of it.  Inside and out are showroom quality and the mechanics of the vehicle are terrific.  Soooooooo much fun to drive and I've had my share of so called nice sports cars.  I was looking to purchase a fun car that didn't break the bank and this is it.  Too bad they stopped making them in 2012 but they should put them back in production.  The rest of their line is really lacking appeal in my opinion.

2 1/2 yrs later.  I am still enjoying the Spyder.   No issues other than general maintenance and service requirements.  Great riding car and would buy another if this thing ever wears out - which I doubt.

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,benz, 04/15/2005,Fun To Drive,4,The media will just not give this company any breaks.  The public needs to know this car is not only fun and comfortable but it looks great and is VERY reliable.  I have driven these vehicles since 1996 and have never had any problems.
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,Pebbles, 03/24/2005,Love It!,5,"I love my GTS Spyder.  Living in an area with many curvy 2 lane blacktop roads, it hugs the road beautifully.Since it is only me & my 100 lb dog that ride in it every day, comfort is not an issue.  I get great gas mileage and love the summer when I can put the top down.  It has great performance from a stop going from 0 to 60 in no time.  I have no regrets!!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,screeli, 09/11/2005,The She-Clipse,3,"This is my second Eclipse and despite the handful of negatives I had with my past Eclipse, this one has been great.  The exterior style in its class is well above par.  The car handles and performs well despite the number of cars in its class that may perform slightly better.  The reality is, however, that very few cars can compare in this price range that offer a convertible and don't look as if they were built for your grandparents.  The Eclipse is fun to drive, affordable and reliable.  To me that is all that matters."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,alan kay, 05/26/2005,"Comfortable, smooth eye-turner",4,"A luxurious ride for the money, with wonderful seats comparable to much more expensive cars I have owned, great stereo, ample power and smooth transmission.  A little slow out of the blocks and a not-so-tight turning radius are my only complaints.  Minimal wind sound.  Economical, extremely dependable--not a rattle, nothing to have them fix on scheduled maintenance trips.  And it looks great.  Oh, EASY to use top with a glass window which has a defroster. All in all, luxury in looks, feel, drive, and dependability.  "

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,Joshua, 09/15/2005,Great car,4,"After reading the expert reviews I was a little leary about buying a Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder.  However, I got a deal I couldn't turn down and have since enjoyed it immensely.  If I wanted a backseat and a lot of trunk space I wouldn't have bought a convertible.  This is a great car to drive.  The V6 engine accelerates smoothly and handles fairly well.  It is quite comfortable for the driver and passenger with easy to use controls.  The convertible top is easy and quick to raise and lower and with the top down, there is minimal problems with the wind.  Overall this is a great car and a lot of fun to drive.  I am glad I ended up buying it."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,Driver, 05/01/2009,Great,5,"I love this car it was my dream car... It was all i expected - fast, stylish, and an eye catcher. I often bumped curbs but other than that it was great - never had a problem brought it at 52000miles. The only thing i had to do is get a new battery at 79000 miles."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,andy dansereau, 02/17/2005,sporty and practical,4,"Contrary to Edmunds' review, this car is a bled of sport, and prticality. It handles resonably enough especially after repacing the Goodyear rsa tires with toyo proxes 4. Its fuel economy is good. The styling in and out is great, an easy car to live with. The top and windows go down with one push of the button.exhaust note is sporty. Its not super fast but it does go and the engine has great torque. Its not bad in the snow either.  The body integrity is much better than Chrysler Sebring or Mustang which I have had. It has some trade offs as an all out sports car but you get  is a tight car, decent handling and acceleration, good looks, space for and occational passenger and good quality. I reccomend this car."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,BobS, 04/09/2005,"Looks Ferrari, Cost affordable, Fun Car",4,"Everyday I climb into my Mitsu Eclipse Spyder, put the top down and play my Beachboys CD cruising to Malibu, I feel like I am in a Ferrari (Red).  The car design with the side tunnels takes people by surprise.  When it approaches from the front view, they think it is an expensive sports car.  When they see the rear, they know it isn't, but seem still impressed.  I cannot tell you how many people have said WOW!, that is a nice car.  I love mine.  I could care less what the experts say.

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,Melissa, 04/30/2005,New-used car,4,At first I wasn't keen on the idea of purchasing a convertible but once we had our first really nice day and I took it for a spin with the top down I LOVE IT. Although this car isn't practical if you have a family or do a lot of long distance traveling with other people over all in my opinion it's a eye catching fun little sports car that I'm sure will bring us many years of joyous fun. 
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,Car4me, 09/01/2005,Bad Vehicle,1,"I have had two of these cars and I would not recommend them.  My first Eclipse was a 2002 Spyder and was constantly in the repair shop for mechanical problems.  I thought I had a lemon so I traded it in on another Eclipse and I am having the same problems.  My advice - do not buy an Eclipse Sypder, they are nothing but trouble."

i didnt. after just 3000 miles, the 
lower contol arm went out. the 
dealership told me this was my fault. i 
didnt hit anything or get in any wrech 
at all. i had to pay 250 for the part 
and did the work myself, and about 1300 
for the tires because when the control 
arm goes out, so do the tires. did i 
forget to say this was the show room 
model?!?!?! the dealership did nothing 
to pay for any of the cost of the part

the dealership before you would buy a 
mitsu period."

I did recive a car when I turned 16, it was not a spyder. When I did get the Spyder I have enjoyed it ever since... It is so much fun to drive, and it has just enough power to please me. I would recommend this car to anyone. It truly has been the car of my dreams!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,tml, 05/28/2005,Spyder,4,"Handles well, rides well, runs well, nice support with leather driver seat. 5 speed shifts good and ratios are spaced well so you are not always shifting. My highway milage is consistently 31.2 mpg with the 4 cylinder. Better than rated average.  Very little convertible quiver on rough roads. My golf bag fits in the trunk. Factory infinity stereo is very good. You can spend more but this is just an all around fun ride for the price. PS Would you media reviewers get over the back seat size. You not reviewing your dad's Buick."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,JG, 01/23/2005,Front Wheel Drive,4,The vehicle is totally fun to drive. Downtown driving is easy for driving and parking. Buckle up and hang on because this vehicle has plenty of power.
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2005,OzzyGT, 06/09/2007,Spyder GT,4,"I bought my UV Blue Pearl right off the showroom. I have since installed several performance parts including intake, exhaust, springs, and new stickier tires - this helped a lot, and I have much more to do. This car is a babe-magnet and is wonderful with the top down. Hardly any wind buffeting at all. This is a perfect car to modify and customize. It will not be a rocket, however because the convertibles weigh a little more than average. Enjoy.  "

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Tommy Ketcher, 03/28/2016,Have Loved this Car for 10 +years now,5,"This is a really fun car to drive, The top comes down and back up in 18 seconds with no issues 12 years. Have not had a single repair in the 72,800 miles I have put on it. Replaced the Battery, Tires in 2013 and other than that nothing except the recommended services such as Oil Changes. Vandals sliced open the Convertible top in 2017 and I took it to a Company in Kansas City, KS under insurance. Top King specializes in that kind of work and it is flawless again. I have considered trading it in several times but can find nothing that I would like to have under 50k that would take its place. Paint is like new, some hazing on Headlight covers that I need to take to have detailed.

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Sluggish Hottie!, 12/17/2006,A Sluggish Hottie,4,"I have owned three convertibles prior to this one and it is by far the best value and hottest looking one I have owned.  It is gorgeous, fun-to-drive and and very spacious inside.  The top stowage system is superb and works flawlessly.  The brakes are great.   However, I am not happy that this is such a heavy car with the same horsepower as a Pontiac Solstice, which is half as big.  What gives?  My engine should have another 100 horsepower to really move.  All-in-all, there is no other car to compare at this price.  I drove the Miata, Solstice, BMW Z4, 300Z and none have the roomy interior, killer sound system, awesome top and ""drool appeal."" "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,James P Hooley, 10/11/2010,"What a ball, but read the owner's manual",4,"It's been a really fun car for 6000 miles in 2 months.  From Phoenix to Ohio and back, it was great.  Not quite enough leg support for longer journeys for tall people, but a small price.  I've read multiple reviews here, and those with certain issues should read their owner's manual.  It specifically conveys to NOT clean the car via an automated car wash.  It specifically conveys that if the CD changer ""overheats"", it WILL shut down to protect the system.  These are really incidentals in the grand scheme.  I do wish that I didn't have to take it to a dealer to change the gear box fluid of my 5 speed.   I've never done that in my life for cars that went 200K, but it is what it is."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Paul, 12/11/2016,Sporty,5,"Ten years and 55,000 miles, three batteries, 2 sets of tires. I just replaced the clutch which required the engine to be yanked and re-installed. The interior plastic is easily scratched - don't take dogs for a ride! Otherwise, the car has held up great. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is at 500 watts per channel is more than adequate with the subwoofer mounted in the back seat cushion. The car is very quick and agile on windy roads which makes it very fun to drive. Visibility out of the back window when the rood is up is limited by the small oval rear window, but at least it is glass and not Isinglass. The car is solid with no rattles after 10 years which is remarkable in and of itself, but being a convertible makes it even more impressive.

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Mike, 11/11/2006,Fun! Fun! Fun!,4,"When looking for a new vehicle I wanted a convertible with front-wheel drive that fit my golf clubs for a reasonable price. This car fits all four criteria.  My son always said,""Dad, get a fun car."" Well, that's what I got. This car is just a joy to drive-comfortable, quiet, and great sound system with fingertip controls. Personally, my complaint is that now when I need a car to fit four, I don't have one. The complaint about the car itself, though, is the blind spot. It IS difficult to see out the back and side of this car-no doubt. But my criteria was met and if I concern myself with just that, then I made a great choice. I get about 18 mpg locally and 27 highway. And don't forget, it takes premium gas. I get nothing but oohs and ahhs, with this car and I love it."

Since I was unfamiliar w/ it I wasn't looking for this model - styling and Sunburst Orange color caught my eye. It is very economical to own and often get compliments. I have never owned a car for so long nor so many miles - love driving it w/ top down in the summer. Never driven in the winter - but it does have front wheel drive.

I have been researching the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder online and decided to purchase a used one.  No regrets so far.  I haven't driven with the top down yet, so I cannot say much about it.

There is a heat shield that rattles because of the Ohio winters and the salt on the roads corroded it loose. It handles quite well for a 4cyl. but wish I had gotten the 6.  Gas mileage is good, not great, but what do you want for 170 horses.  Needs a place to put your left arm when it is not on the wheel. CD changer would not play some CDs when it got very hot outside, then it fixed its self when it cooled down.  Top is well designed and works very fast.  Top material seems to be high quality and does not make much noise at highway speeds.  Aerodynamics with top down are very good. "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,peter p, 07/11/2006,19 Seconds To a Smile,4,"I looked at several convertibles before going with the Spyder. At the end it the Spyder vs. the MINI S. The tonneau top, superior AC, and vastly more comfortable seats gave the nod to the Spyder. The MINI S, although a quicker and tighter ride, was left to someone else willing to pay a hefty premium.   The GT has plenty of power although it does not really kick in until the RPMs hit 4,000. Because of this I prefer that the TAC is on the left where I can see it. This comes in handy when playing with the Sportronic AT whilst driving with the top down and Rockford system UP.    Go leather and get the heated seats. My dealer loaned me a cloth overnight and the heat was sorely missed. "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Rockdoc, 04/29/2006,Turning heads - 2007 Eclipse Spyder,4,"Heads are turning as my new 2007 Mitsubishi GT Eclipse Sypder rolls down the road.  This new model year vehicle seems to draw a lot of interest from the public - and with good reason - the car is very attractive.  I purchased the GT 6-speed manual and have thoroughly enjoyed the power and smooth shifting-ability.  It has a nice growl to it as well.  This car makes sense for all convertible seekers, but value may be the key. While the back seat is smaller, one can easily fit two small kids comfortably, two small ladies for a drive around town, or extra luggage on a trip.  The trunk will fit two golf (mini) bags!  Excellent... finally, the stereo - It rocks.  Grab some music, flip the top and drive."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Slick, 09/03/2007,Slick,4,Drove several other makes and models before purchasing.  This is my first Eclipse. I knew in the first five minutes of the test drive that this was the car I wanted. Lots of power with the 260 hp.  Very comfortable seating.  I love it.

We saw the 2007 and needed a second updated Spyder.  They both sit in my driveway and I always get comments about the two.  The 2007 is much larger and they look cute together.  My husband now drives the 1999 and I drive the 2007.  He has to ask me to switch every so often.  I told him I get enough stares as it is, but with this car, it is amazing how many comments I get about me and the car.  Ladies, this is a great pickup car if your interested.

I owned a '92 Mitsubishi VR4, I missed it until October 2006, when I tested drove the 2007 Spyder, I drove out of the lot that night, while I was there to see another car with my cousin for his wife. The car drives with a feeling of hugging the road which is a good feeling when shifting yes the 6-speed.  Girls rule.  While the 9 speakers, heated leather seats 6 changer CD MP3 player along with the convertible brings it all into one place and time of being a wonderful driving machine. Oh yeah, should I mention the sweet purr of power with that V6 engine.  Sweet!  Girls rule with this machine (boys get jealous! LOL).  In all the car is a beast amongst the others and it's affordable."

I left the next day and went to Texas on a road trip and this car is amazing to drive.  It handles well and has plenty of power.  I went to San Antonio, TX so once there I was able to put the top down and really enjoy the car."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Teezie, 09/27/2007,Smiling,4,"Started shopping for a two-seater convertible; Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Skye, Nissan 350Z all great cars, but either gutless or too spendy. Found my Spyder, with 3,440 miles, 5 grand less than new and the previous owner had put on 245/35ZR20 low profile tires and 20"" rims. No brainer. This car is so much fun to drive, a little more room than a conventional two-seater, handles corners great, the wind doesn't knock it around and the top is much quieter than my Mustang convertible GT was. Comfortable on road trips, excellent exhaust note. Shifting is a breeze and a pleasure. Stereo adjusts automatically when you put the top down, lines are sleek and sporty. Love it all."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,HMehlman, 11/16/2007,Hottest Convertible,5,This car has lots of power ... and gets lots of looks!  Nice featues such as radio and placement of controls.  Decent ride. It's not a small car!  Park it next to others and you'd be surprised how big it really is!  Plus ... I eat Mustangs any day of the week!
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,sashotspyder, 02/28/2011,My New Hot Ride,5,"This will be my 4th Mitsubishi and I've said it before and I'll say it again...they are highly under rated!
I have no complaints about any of them.
I had two 30000GTs, then I bought an 06 Elipse that I loved and now I will be picking up my new 2007 GT convertible and I can't wait!
 It only has 25K miles on it so it's practically new.
Its red with black leather and 6speed!
 I'm going to have alot of fun this summer!!!!

I know already from reading all the reviews that this will be another great car from Mitsubishi!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,swaflyguy, 03/19/2007,Love It,5,"I was looking at the Solstice, Sky and the Mustang.  The quality and materials of the American cars are nothing compared to the Japanese.  Also, the shifting was much tighter in the Eclipse than any of the others.  Plus, you get 6 gears with the Mitsubishi and 5 with the American models."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Jimmy, 03/31/2007,Love the car but has problems,4,"Have had the car for nearly a month, but half of the time has been at the dealer with steering problems.  The car pulls to the left, pulls really hard in the left lane of a 5 lane freeway and as you move to the right, to the far right lane, still pulls left.  Has been test driven by several dealer service people including a Mitsubishi engineer and a frame shop alignment specialist.  The cars, as it turns out is designed that way, there is no correction.  The car is very fatiguing to drive.  The fabric seats are also very hot, don't breath. May have to return the car.  Test drove 5 of the cars, they all do it and the engineer agrees. Hard to believe but they have designed cars that pull left."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Chad, 08/08/2006,Never liked Spyders Until Now,4,My wife has always said she loved spyders and pushed me to get one until I finally gave up. I was driving by when I saw the 2007 Eclipse and decided to stop.  I fell in love with this car as soon as I sat in it. I took it home to the wife and she was in complete shock that I broke down and got it! Riding around town with the top down is just great and this car will turn heads!
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,James Hawk, 09/12/2006,The Honeymoon is Over...,3,"I bought my '07 Eclipse Spyder in June and it was great until the first incident in September. One rear Bridgstone tire separated the tread at 2,400 miles. Had it been on the front, I would have been injured.  This also damaged the rim.  I went back to the dealer who stated, ""not our problem, it's not covered under the warranty.""  They directed me to Bridgestone who ""did me a favor"" by replacing the tire. No one wants to cover the damaged rim due to Mitsubishi putting defective tires on their new car. After only 2,400 miles, I think the dealer could have been more receptive to this dangerous condition. I still love the vehicle, but don't trust my life to the tires. I'll use my own money to replace all four tires now."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,kra, 07/03/2008,"Fun to drive, bad blind spots",4,"Absolutely love this car!  Got it for better fuel economy (traded an Xterra), and I get about 300 miles to a tank, more on the highway (though not too much more).  The car is just a joy to own and drive.  No unscheduled maintenance needed yet, but the vehicle is young (9 months so far). The convertible top folds down very quickly - ~19 seconds. All that said, there are complaints. See suggested improvements"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,bajajanice, 08/29/2008,"Nice car, but",3,"I loved this car when I bought it brand new, however, there are too many blind spots when driving with the top up. I have had this car for 8 months and I have to take it in, the top hydraulic system is out already and needs to be checked. I feel the frame of the car is weak. The car is so low that the nose scraps on everything. This car is an accident waiting to happen with all the blind spots.  Other than that, the car is beautiful and gets lots of looks"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,James, 02/23/2010,My Spyder,3,"This is my first car. I have mixed opinions on this car. Mine is black with grey interior and tan roof. Some Pro's are -Good heated seats, - Good stereo system, - Excellent brakes, - Good Handling. The Con's are -Terrible roof, I have 8 tears in it from the roof being defective. Getting it replaced under warranty is apparently 1 in a million chance but a new one is $1600 + labor. Good luck with that. - TERRIBLE ACCELERATION, it's almost a joke. -Underpowered so much that when you have passengers gas mileage is about 17 to the gallon. -Rattles everywhere. -Backseat too small -Cheap to the touch. -Top leaks in car washes and can't be patched or fixed without buying a new one. Do not buy this car"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Mike Hesse, 09/23/2006,Over the Mustang,4,"We test drove the 350Z.  It had no interior room.  Then we tried the Soltice.  Nope, it needs a bigger engine.  The Mustang nice, but it uses old technology and gets poor gas mileage.  The Mini Cooper is to yuppy.  The Honda 2000 is a faster Miata, but it is too small,  The Mazda RX-8 is very unconfortable.  Its arm rest is too high, it has a quirky engine, and the air didn't work very well.  The Toyota Solara made for Grandmas.  The Corvette is too common.  At last we come to the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spider.  It is a fun, sporty car that my wife and I love.  It's our weekend cruiser.  It's fast, comfortable, sporty, and I love how the top is buried."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,eeyore320, 05/20/2013,Poor Top Quality,2,"I bought my car brand new in 2007 and have been nothing but disappointed since.
I had to take it back to the dealer 3 times in the first month, and had to fight to get anything fixed on it.
I noticed some slight tears in my top at about 60,100 miles and when I took it to the dealer and they told me the car was no longer under warranty even though I purchased it with 596 miles on it.
They refused to fix it even though it is obvious its their mistake.
All I can say is I will never buy any Mitsubishi again."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Practical sports car, 07/16/2008,Practical Everyday Sporty Convertible,5,"I live in Colorado and wanted a sporty convertible that could be driven all year, even in snow. I wanted a little extra room to carry things on a road trip. I wanted an easy roof to put up and take down. Lastly, good gas mileage. This car does it all! The front wheel drive got me through every snowstorm last winter. We just completed a 2500 mile road trip and carried a bunch of family heirlooms in the trunk and back seat. We averaged 26.5 MPG with the four cylinder driving 4 mph over the limit all the time. The top goes up or down in 17 seconds with no tucking or booting, can be done at a stop light.It is the only new car I have ever purchased that hasn't been back to the dealer for warranty."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,kevboy89, 01/05/2009,IN LOVE,4,"I have been wanting this car since I started driving.  I was looking at the previous generation models and they were nice, because I figured I couldn't afford a new one.  However, they are very affordable, and I was able to get a 2007.  So far I am loving this car as I knew I would, Sunset Pearlescent color is amazing, V6 is more than enough, very comfortable (except in the back seat, but I didn't buy it for people to ride in the back).  I got used to the blind spots within days."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,heliflyer216, 03/21/2009,Happy owner,4,"I bought this car quite unexpectedly.  I saw it in a Mitsubishi lot and the design drew me in.  After extensive test drives (and web research), I was pleasantly surprised.  It has power, comfort, handling, and style.  The convertible top is so easy to put up or down. The interior is amazingly quiet when the top is up.  I've had the car for 6 months and its still a joy to own and drive.  I highly recommend this car!  Consumer Reports doesn't have much nice to say about this car.  But actual owners adore the Eclipse. Listen to the owners! "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Witqueen, 06/03/2006,Good to be Me,5,"So far so good, This is my second Eclipse Spyder from Mitsubishi. It has a nice appearance.  I get compliments from all who see it, even strangers in parking lots. Hopefully the interior will hold up better then the '01 model.  I wasn't going to buy anoher one, I waited over a year for the new Pontiac G6 convertible...what a disappointment.  I left the Pontiac dealer and drove back to Mitsubishi. I went down to a 4-cyl. from the V6 I was used to driving, but the power was great. The V6 felt great. This car does not have a lot of people room, but it has plenty of shopping room. It has very sensitive controls.  I am glad they got rid of the Infinity sound system. Overall I give this car a 9.5."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Anthony Petitti, 06/06/2006,My favorite new toy...,4,"I must say I may be biased, as it took one 10 minute test drive to win my heart. Acually, to be fair, I think I fell in love with this car from the moment I first laid eyes on it's sleek lines and daunting 18"" wheels. Driving the car just renewed my faith in the ability of an attainable car bringing a smile to my face on all levels. From the well built interior to the formidable performace, this car will not disappoint."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,MikeZ, 07/01/2006,Awesome convertible for the money,4,"I purchased the new Eclipse after looking at several other choices in the convertible area, namely the 350Z and the Solara.  After test-driving the three cars I chose the Eclipse mainly because the bang for the buck factor.  The Solara was just as expensive but bland, slow, and ugly. The Z was great but too much money (it was a tough choice between the two).  The eclipse has tons of power and torque, a great sound system, and IMO unique but great styling."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,james, 07/03/2006,Great car...so far,4,"I have only had my '07 Eclipse for a little over a month. But so far..WOW. The design is nice. The back end looks great. The front end could use a little spicing up. The inteior design is nothing short of great. The sound system is dynamic. The top is easy to open and close and the it tucks away semlessly. The 4-cylinder leaves a little to be desired on power in takeoffs, BUT..again, I bought it for fuel economy. So the trade off is OK. The bottom line is: as a motorcycle rider, this is just as much fun and I don't have to put my feet down at a stop sign!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Zepplin pilot, 07/27/2006,2007 Eclipse Spyder,4,"Even the 2.4L four cyl. is fun but the power band does not even start untill 3,500 RPM.  This car gets great gas milage, which is the only reason not to get the 3.6L.  Maybe a cold air intake and a new chip will wake up the engine.  It also has a lot of torque steer."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Kim, 08/02/2006,Best Car Ever,4,"I was looking for a convertable and was interested in the Saturn Sky, since I was not able to get one of those, I started looking at other cars. I happened to test drive the '07 Eclipse day while looking at options, and I fell in love. This car is awesome. I have gotten more looks in this car and the way it rides is unbelievable. I would highly recommend getting this car to anyone who want a 4 seat convertable. I have kids so that is also what helped me decide."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,DebbieD, 04/05/2006,I love my Spyder!,4,"I purchased my 2007 Eclipse Spyder just 10 days ago and I'm still in love!  It's so much fun to drive - turns corners really well - and I love driving a 5 speed.  My only complaint is that the A/C knobs and temperature dial are not available to the passenger if the driver is shifting.  The stereo is also amazing.  Putting the top up/down is not only easy - but fun!  I don't drive very many miles to/from work - however, it appears that I'm getting pretty good gas mileage.  In a few months I'll write another review (once the honeymoon is over)!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Larry Reimer, 04/16/2006,A Blast to drive,5,"I traded in my 6-speed auto 2006 Corvette Coupe for the 6-speed manual Eclipse Spyder GT. I found the car much more ""responsive"" and easier to live with on a daily basis, and I've owned numerous sports cars, including 3 Vettes. After only 200 miles the care gets 21 MPG in city driving. It is a real ""sleeper""....and great has quality for the price."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Spyderlover, 06/24/2006,Spyder GT is FUN,5,"The Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GT Convertible is fast, reliable, and most of all FUN. It handles well and has a great look. It's a very smooth comfortable ride. It is definitely worth the reasonable investment."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,BigDaddyMoe, 06/26/2006,The Fun is back,4,"I hated the Eclipse Spyder from 2000-2005, I had a 1999 one that I loved but traded it in when my son was born.   I saw the 2007 and drooled when I test drove it.   I can't stop driving it and I live in Vegas so I have the top down a lot.    With all my driving I'm spending too much money on gas :(.   The stereo system is awesome and I love the blue back lit dashboard at night!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Michael, 06/27/2006,WOWIE!,4,"This is my third Eclipse Spyder.  I had an '01 and '03, and by far this is the best one ever! From the inside to the out, I am in love with the new style.  At 48 years old I feel like a school kid again.  And the comments that I'm getting on this car are remarkable.  It is more soild than the past Spyders and it is great to drive.  This car is a keeper in my book. "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,LCummings, 08/29/2006,Beauty Isn't Always Skin Deep,5,"This car is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well. I get stopped by neighbors every day telling me how nice my car is. The car drives very smoothly.  As far as the power goes, I stepped into this car from owning a V8 truck and with the manual transmission and I don't feel the difference except for in my wallet at the gas pump! I love my 2007 Mitsubishi Spyder."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,SPYDERMAN, 10/04/2006,My Pet Spyder,5,"I've owned my Spyder for two weeks and I'm in love.  I find it hard to keep my hands off her leather-wrapped steering wheel.  This car is very fun to drive with very responsive steering, amazing acceleration for a 4-cyl., a satin smooth suspension, and a stereo system so AWESOME that my friend described it as wearing top quality headphones.  With the top down, wind noise is no problem for the stereo system.  Can anyone find the 9- speakers?  I've only found 7 of the 9.  Everyone teases me about the basically unusable back seats, but I call it the dedicated sub-woofer space.  Everybody thinks this car cost twice what it cost me, in other words this convertible is a fantastic value too.  I'm lovin' It!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,dennis, 11/22/2006,Unexpected,4,"For the money the Eclipse Spyder GT is incredibly fast.  From stop light to stop light it makes 400 hp cars mad.  The service dept. said it goes 0-60 in 5.2 to 5.5 seconds.  The looks quality and handling feels like a $60,000 automobile.  I feel like I got more than my money's worth on this one.  It gets second looks every time I drive it."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,SUMMER0917, 12/13/2006,I Love This Car,5,"I love driving my Eclipse Spyder.  It's fast and just a blast to drive. It also has a great sound system, heated seats, and so much more. Mitsubishi has also improved the turning in the new Eclipse.  They have also made the car a lot more like a sports car then before. You will love this car."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Bob V, 12/13/2006,2007 Eclipse Spyder,5,This is a great fun car to drive. It has great handling on the roadways. I have had many compliments on the style. Some people had asked me if it was a Porsche.
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Evelyn, 12/21/2006,#1 Dream,5,"Everything about this car is a joy.  I am proud of the looks, the quality and the comfort."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,L. Lykes, 01/19/2007,Fun Car!,4,"This car is FUN! It has power and pizazz.  After driving a Corolla for 12 years, I was looking for something different -- and I got it!    "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,mitsubishievo, 01/30/2007,Mitsubishievo's Eclipse Review,4,"This car is so totally awesome.  It's the best car I could have gotten besides my Evo of course, but still it's a really good car to me."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,OrangeSkie, 02/28/2008,Car of my dreams,4,I have wanted this car for ten years and bought it brand new off the lot.  Have really enjoyed having it.  I have a four year old daughter and it is somewhat friendly even for her.  The top is easy to put up and down.  It handles like a dream and I drive it hard.  It is really good on the road with wind not blown all over the place and the safty features are great.  
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,bobcat27, 03/09/2007,Love It,4,"I just traded in my '03 Jetta GLI VR6 6 speed for my new Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder.  I was tired of the sunroof and wanted a drop top.  I wanted something with some speed.  I looked at the Solstice for its looks but I didn't want a GM vehicle.  I looked at the Mustang but they are everywhere.  Finally, I found the Eclipse and I fell for it.  It truly is my dream car.  There is very little I would change about it."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Badgirl, 03/13/2007,I am Back into the Spyder,4,"I owed an Eclipse Spyder in the past and I loved it.  This is still new to me and I have had the chance to drive it around the city and I love it.  It is a little loud when shifting, but it's awesome."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Uncle Harry, 03/22/2007,Great car - should have gotten one sooner,4,Just picked up a new Spyder after trying both the Spyder as well as the Solstice.  Spyder wins hands down in many areas not the least of which is comfort.
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Badgirl, 03/08/2007,The Spyder is Back,4,"I just purchased this car and I really have not had a chance to drive it much, but when I test drove the car it rode nicely.  I used to own a 2005 and I loved it.  I love the total makeover of the car."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,VegasMike21, 03/16/2007,"Fast, Fun, and Exciting",4,"What's more is there to say about the 2007 Eclipse Spyder than it's Fast, Fun, and Exciting to drive!  Everything about the car is great from the exterior design to the Rockford Fosgate 650 watt stereo with the subwoofer built into the backseat!  If you're in the market for a convertible check out the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, you won't be disappointed!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Jim, 03/30/2007,Great Car,5,"Great car, fun to drive."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Dick, 04/04/2007,Eclipse Spyder 2007 they got it right,4,The six speed manual performes smoothly.  Torque is impressive in all gears.  Convertible top operates like magic.  Rear seating is very limited.  Makes my daily commute to work a pleasure. The lines of the car are distinctive and will get you second looks.  Little torque steering from front wheel drive. 
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Paul, 04/13/2007,What a Car!,4,"Fifth consecutive Eclipse, by far the best. Hard to believe actually! So fast, and even with the 18"" wheels, rides very well in our rough NJ pavement. Cuts corners like a pro, shift throws are short, braking is strong. Fuel mileage is so-so compared to my last GT 5-speed, but it makes up for it in sheer power. Thanks Mitsu for finally installilng a REAL sound system, heated seats, a windscreen, auto climate control, and an automatic boot cover. Those few things totally transform the car and make it feel much more expensive than it actually is. Love this car!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,DG, 07/10/2007,Glad It's Back,5,"Before buying my 07 Spyder I first drove the Ford Mustang and then Pontiac GXP Solstice.  Great body design on the Spyder had me at first glance.  The first 3 minutes behind the wheel of the Spyder convinced me.  Lot's of power with 260 hp v6 engine, comfortable seats and just plain fun to drive.  I felt like a kid again. Something I was expecting from the Mustang or the GXP, but they failed to provide.  My first Mitsubishi, sorry it took me so long."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,SpyderMan28, 07/07/2007,Better than I thought,5,This car is more comfortable than my 2004 spyder and rides smoother.  It has more power and the gas mileage is incredible.  The best I've gotten on the highway so far is 31 mpg.  The worst I've seen in the city was 21 and I was moving pretty quick.  I just wish they made more kits for it.
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Daphne Streeter, 07/23/2007,Love This Car!,4,"I cannot tell you how much I have loved driving this car.  It is the best convertible on the market, bar none! It is gorgeous, drives smooth and fast, and safe to boot.  I have no hesitations recommending this car.  You will love it!!"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Spyder Man, 05/18/2007,Fantastico,4,"This car is a play toy for the wife and me. Got the automatic for her, but no regrets. Between the V6 and the Sportronic mode I can have my fun. Love the looks, power, handling and that awesome stereo. Plenty of room in the front seats. The back seat is for kids only, but hey it's a convertible. It's not supposed to be practical. A great fun car to cruise the scenic backroads with. The sunset pearlescent paint and the body style really gets attention. This is the most expensive car we have ever bought. It has all the options."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,jtrushmore, 07/21/2007,Fun To Drive,4,I recently upgraded to the Eclipse from an 02 lLancer.  I bought the car a few days ago and have already fallen in love with it.  Even with the 4 cyl. it has a lot of get up and go.  I was very surprised with the power that little 4-banger put out.  The leather interior and instrumentation are amazing.  
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Luis Guzman, 08/07/2007,No words to describe,4,"This car has the looks, the power and the reputation to hold its own on the road. Every person that sees me with this car thinks that it costs much more than it actually does. This is my first convertible, and all I can say is that I feel like a new person with this car."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Red Pearl, 08/29/2007,My Red Pearl,4,"I love driving this car! Love the look, the color, and the looks I get while driving it don't hurt either. I like the fact that my hair doesn't blow around very much with the top down. I'm disappointed with the nose mask. It's very difficult to put it on and it does not stay put! The paint is already damaged as a result. The mask is badly designed and unnecessarily complicated to use. I love the electric roof but so far, it has stuck in an awkward position 4 times. The 3rd time it was towed to the dealership, they found the problem and showed me how to fix it myself the next time! "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Daddy, 03/19/2008,"Once Again, I Love My Car",4,"The trunk is big enough for all of my and my son's luggage when we go to the airport.  The car is fun to drive, but most of all I love the stereo. I can fit about 140 songs on an MP3 CD, and the in-dash will take 6 of them, so there's no need for an iPod. After almost 18 months though, there is a rattle from the subwoofer at certain frequencies. Taking it tomorrow to get that fixed under warranty.  All in all, I love this car! It's not perfect, but fun to drive. "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Dennis, 04/04/2008,my spyder,4,"I own an Endevor and the quality of that made me look at the Spyder. I'm very happy with this car. The speed and handling is very acceptable. You don't buy this car for backseat space. Overall, so far I have really had no problems with this car. My wife loves driving it also and my friends are very impressed with the stereo and the sleek sexy look of it. The convertible drops down so smooth and tucks away in the trunk."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Jules, 12/11/2007,A car that looks and performs well,4,"This vehicle is fun! The lack of features excluded at purchase can be dishearting but can be made up in the overall performance of the vehicle. In my first year of ownership, regular oil changes have maintained a smooth running vechile. The only real problems I have experienced is with the steering radius and electronic drop top. Small cosmetic pieces popping off were an issue. Thus far, the eclipse is a realiable vehicle. "
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2007,Stan, 05/28/2018,A fun ride,5,"Bought the car used as a summer car for  fun outings.  There have been no maintenance issues. The car is peppy and responsive. The only down side is poor visibility to the rear when the top is up. I would buy the car again
"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,Glenn, 07/01/2017,Fun Car,5,"We were looking for a convertible to leave at our lake house and bought the Spyder.  Its been a nice surprise and great fun to drive. It looks great in black and get lots of compliments.  Money well spent.  
Update:  The car is still doing well. We enjoy driving it and are planning on keeping it for a long time.  
Second Update:  still enjoying the car with no issues at all.
Third update: car is still doing great. Always a pleasure to drive.
Fourth update: No problems at all. Still enjoying it. I’m looking forward to driving it this summer.

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,Rebecca, 09/11/2008,It aint my daddy's truck,4,"I have always bought and drove small pickup trucks (rangers, s10s) and this is a COMPLETELY new experience.  Although the turn radius is greater than my last pickup and with the top up you can see very little around you, it more than makes up for having to be extra careful with the fun of owning a convertible AND the really flashy look that draws everyone's attention!  I work at a school and the kids LOVE it when I put the top up/down because they think it looks like a transformer! I never dreamed I would own an orange car, but would not trade it for another color now if offered!! :D"
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,TopDown2, 12/29/2008,Consider this model,4,"This car is under-reported. Beautiful design turns heads, esp. with skirts all the way around. Great performance, steering, suspension; good brakes. Nice throttle note. Roomy front, but adults are really pinched in rear. Excellent stereo. All controls silky and intuitive. Wheels are set way out, and easy to scrape... watch out. Top functions and seals flawlessly; minimal wind noise. I love this car. My next step up would be a Boxster.  I do not like the changes to front end in 2009."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,andy, 08/21/2007,A champion right out the gate,4,"The 2008 Spyder GT V6 manual is a striking beast right out the gate - very powerful, torquey, yet a smooth and cushioned ride. I've driven the 2007 model as well. The 08 adds 18"" wheels in place of 17"". The handling is phenomenal. The smooth, quick stick and power make this an incredible sports convertible. The top operates deftly. Sirius sat radio is also standard. Downshifting and passing is joy. My car is black and I keep it washed. It gets stares wherever I drive in southern california."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,ric387, 12/06/2009,Poor rear and side visibility,4,The only negative aspects of the car are indeed the poor rear and side visibility pointed out by others when the top is up and the poor quality of the interior plastic that marks quite easily.  The car is so far totally reliable and I had excellent service at the dealer for the normal warranty schedule.  
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,Paul Hudgins, 08/13/2007,2008 Mitsubishi Spyder,4,"Just purchased the vehicle within the past week and love it!  It's fun, challenging, all the things I'm looking for in a new sports car."
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,Ted Kinney, 10/17/2007,Real Review on a great car,4,First off this is not a dealer review. I saw the Pontiac Solstice in a Bon Jovi video and it got me thinking I should have a new car. I went out and test drove the Pontiac. Next I drove the Spyder. There was no comparison. In the Spyder you have enough room in the truck to put a set of golf clubs and some extra stuff. Also you have enough room in the back seat to squeeze someone if you have to for a short ride or more realistically use for additional storage. I have no complaints except for the blind spot when the top is up. 
mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,tjs1963, 07/05/2011,Most Fun in the Sun,5,"This car is a blast... and a real head-turner.  It's probably the most under rated/reported  sports car in this price range.  I wanted the V6 because the car's weight seemed to justify the beefier engine.  This baby along with the manual 6speed can really push you into your seat when accelerating through the gears.  Much more power and speed then I anticipated... but great Fun!

Since summer the top is always down and the sound system rocks.  Hey this is what having a convertible sports car is all about.  I love it!"

mitsubishi,eclipse-spyder,2008,ric387, 03/18/2009,NICE CANADIAN SUMMER TOY,4,"Just traded a Miata for a 2008 with 9,000k. I agree with the purists: the Spyder is not a real sports car (front-wheel drive pretty much closes the argument on that). But it has good looks, great interior, room to spare in driving position and very good performance with the V6 6 speed manual transmission and all this in better than average comfort. The car also made sense budget-wise. I feel I have the best of both worlds: a car that offers sports-like performance and looks with more room and comfort than a lot of more expensive two seaters. Good-looking, but with brains! A word for the torque issue: real, but only if you really push hard the revs, otherwise OK. Mine is triple-black. Love it

Update 2020: still own the car. Summer driven, have now 50k. No reliability issues save for the heating/ac fan motor in the dash that became noisy and was changed. Did the timing belt last year as preventive action. That’s it apart from usual maintenance. Paint holding well. No water in light casings . Interior holding well. Top also. In short, still very happy with the car. You find one as well-kept as mine, buy ! Added a wind deflector, it’s worth it with the top down. Also looks nicer if you have extra luggage on the back seat on a long road trip like we did last year. They should still make it.

For a convertible the trunk is relativity large.
I can get two medium suit cases into it.
There is nothing better for spring, summer, or fall road trip with your babe.
The air flow in the cockpit is very minimal. The only knock I have (at 60k miles) is that with the top down & the windows down & the stereo up, there is an subtle intermittent rattle in the drivers door.

The kids are no longer at home and there was no need for a back seat. We have owned four-door sedans for the past 25 years and decided to take a plunge to the past and enjoy the sporty vehicles we once drove. We looked at a number of other makes. Our considerations included body looks, interior size, engine size, and cost. The cost eliminated many other vehicles, as well as the interior space. It seemed the more sporty, the smaller amount of front seating area. We have had the car for only two months and do enjoy driving it. "

The blind spot is a beast, but with attentive lane changes and side mirrors, it is possible to maneuver.  It's still early to be sure about reliability, but it seems pretty good with gas.  If you have children this car is a no no!  I am sure the back seats are just to get an insurance break on being a ""four seater"".

I love the convertible top and ease of operation. I got the GS instead of GT because of the lower octane (the GT requires 91). GS seems to have plenty of power for my use. Blind spot in right rear makes you really look when changing lanes though.   Also, beware of adding a factory spoiler, can't see out the back, even when top down... right in the way! I added camera back up. Standard fosgate radio,Gs needs better antenna, anti skip (would upgrade if doing over). Burned Cd's skip A LOT. Key had remote buttons and chip in it... pricey. Really fun to drive though and would buy again."

I'm having issues with fogging on the inside of the front window after it rains (don't have access to garage parking).   I'm going to get a cover to see if that helps.

Back seat for kids only, but my son loves it back there.  Handles well and accelerates great.  Tried the 4 cylinder first, but went with the 6 despite the octane needed.  Definitely more get up and go.  The car is definitely an eye-catcher and I just love driving it.  I put smaller concave mirrors on both side mirrors and that took care of blind spots.

My old car was 19 years old so to me everything about driving this car is new and exciting. The convertible top goes up and down with one push of a button. The car has so much pep and drives so smooth that I find myself speeding at times. The camera (new in 2010) that is used to help you when you put the car in reverse is great.  Merging to get off a highway while moving to your right is very hard due to the huge blind spot the convertible top gives you. Driving with the top off is the best. This car is fun to drive but it takes time to deal with the blind spots that are huge. The backseat is useless. The trunk is big even with the top off. "

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,endeavorlover, 05/20/2015,11/28/2018 Update Endeavor,5,"This vehicle has been the best I have ever owned. We bought used with 21,000 on it now here it is 2015 with 109,000. We have had up keep that is normal for a car this age, brakes, belts, hoses, shocks, etc. we also have had to replace the water pump, and all bearings on the axles. I would drive it across the U.S. Today without hesitation. It still doesn't use oil. Have always run synthetic oil since we owned it. It still runs like a sewing machine. We will keep it until we have it towed off hopefully many years from now. If you find one well maintained, BUY IT! Is very safe and dependable. The AWD is invaluable for rain, snow, and ice.
May 2016
After changing sparkplugs and changing in all belts and hoses for the very first time since owning my Endeavor, the motor runs so smooth and still very peppy.  This is now our second vehicle and does not see as much use as it once did. Still this vehicle has been outstanding. It does have inherited design flaws to contend with but they are not dangerous. If you can find a used Endeavor the 2004 model in particular you will have made a good investment. The key is well maintained. The motor still does not use oil, the transmission is very tight and drive line incredibly strong. I still feel this vehicle has been on of the very best I have ever owned. I would never find an equal anywhere that had the same miles. Still only one occasional squeak in the interior. There are some design flaws with the vehicle. Exterior door handles, exterior vent in front of the windshield, and paint is peeling in various spots.  I still feel and wish I had bought two of these 2004 Endeavors. Still a great vehicle and dependable anytime and anywhere.
Nov. 2016
We still own our dependable 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor. We just put I believe our fourth set of tires on it. Nothing much has changed. The vehicle is an outstanding daily driver. It is ugly as hell because of the peeling paint but otherwise sound. I still wish I had two of these vehicles. Just a bulletproof vehicle. One thing of note, the timing chain is something that should be checked and adjusted every 25 to 35,000 miles. Do not forget or overlook this very important item less you have aluminum shavings ruin your motor. All electrical still works et. power windows, locks, wipers, heater, A/C and blower. This AWD would be a great vehicle for a first for your teenagers.
May 2017. This old Endeavor is still as sound and not using any oil. I have to replace the rear drivers side exterior door handle. The second of four so far. These handles just don't handle UV rays! Other than looking like it has some paint disease it is sound. All electrical items work. It only has 118,000 miles. It has been regulated as my second driver. I think it has become part of the family and most likely be around for a long time to come yet. Got to get a paint job for it someday.
Nov. 28, 2018 Well here it is the end of another year almost and we still have our Endeavor. She, yeah it's a woman, is still humming along. Here are notable things we are dealing with so far. I truly wish the door handles were metal! Definitely not kid proof. They're made of plastic and UV is a killer. So I have bought three new handles and have decided to paint them before installing them myself. I believe once these are painted and clearcoat put on this will stop the brittelness problem for good. I will let you know on my next update.
As far as concerning the engine we only put 9,000 miles on it but ALL city miles. It still doesn't use oil. It is getting close to time to having the timing chain checked so we will have that done by a great local mechanic we trust. The paint job is still peeling and now small rust spots on top of the cab have appeared so it is time to head to a body shop for 2019.
The interior still is immaculate but problems found is the drivers side sunvisor has lost a screw and needs
 repaired. For some reason the back panel on the passenger side seat has fallen off. I highly suspect an attack from some children has caused this as one of the plastic clips is broken.
Exterior trim has been doing well other than the door handles.
I crawled under the vehicle to give it a pre-winter inspection and found light rust spots scattered about on the frame. They are not serious yet and very light but need sanded and primed to prevent further damage.
Maintenance has been key to this vehicle but every cent has been worth it as it is still a very sound and solid vehicle. I would still drive it anywhere without any hesitation. I was interested and decided to Google this vehicle and found so many others who have had great service with this vehicle. One sticks out who had 348,000 miles on their Endeavor. I believe it this is an incredibly well built vehicle mechanically.
One other thing before closing. I am getting ready to install a fourth set of headlights! To me excessive and really not sure why this is occurring. I would be interested to know if other owner has this problem too.

Mileage is average - about what I would expect for the body design and an AWD drivetrain.
The AWD has done wonders for tire ware - very even with quality tires.
Early on, had the classic water pouring into the passenger and/or driver side floor; 2 trips to the dealership to fix . I get maintenance done regularly.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Kevin, 09/24/2015,One of the BEST vehicles I have owned,5,"Me and my wife purchased ours in 2008, a 2004 Silver XLS model with 30k when we purchased it. It was used as our primary vehicle and traveled ALOT of miles since we lived just outside of Orlando and due to family and work we had to travel a average of 50-60 miles round trip for just work/family. During our ownership we had no issue with the Endeavor other than a rear drivers side window actuator going out which was only $70 in parts and extremely easy to fix yourself. The engine didn't give us a single issue and the transmission shifted smoothly like the day we got it. Interior materials are not high end quality, but still very good quality. The paint on the side mirrors and door handles are bit thin and showed fade/oxidation even though I hand washed and wax and sealed the vehicle. Interior cargo room is amazing...able to transport decent size furniture from Ikea many times and packing for long vacation trips with no issue and easy access too. 

Unfortunately a Toyota Tundra hydroplaned through 3 lanes on the opposite direction of traffic, crossed the median and slammed into our Endeavor during rain. Our Endeavor was totalled but did its job to protect my wife, mother in law and my 2 year old son who was sleeping when the Tundra hit us. We walked out with no major injuries..just a couple bruises but my son and mother in law walked away without a scratch. My wife loved the Endeavor and still after they discontinued them would like another one. Great vehicle and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a affordable dependable SUV.

It is our around town vehicle since we bought a new 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport Ultimate Turbo (great SUV).  I do 95% of maintenance and keep up with everything regularly. I change the Mobil 1 synthetic 15,000 mile guaranteed oil every 5k  - 6k miles of mostly HW driving (23.5k a year).  That mileage is now about 9,000 a year since my wife retired.  Wish I could buy another one just like it.  The only issues were the A/C condensation leaking into the driver's side floor and the P0431 code for catalytic converter slow to warm which causes the check engine light to illuminate.  For the A/C fix, I had to remove the seats and carpet and clean everything then added the extension hose to the A/C drain under the SUV per the TSB. All is fine now and has been for many years. One set of Firestone Destination LE tires ran 100,525 miles!  We have 90,000 miles on the Destination LE2 tires now. I wish it didn't need premium gas. Best vehicle we ever owned.  Plan to drive another 100,000 miles or more.  Update: I never did the timing belt work.  I always took to a shop and they messed up about four of the six times.  Currently, we have a small coolant leak from the metal tube leading to the water pump.  Shop says it is too hard for them to fix.  I ordered new seals but the leak stopped a long time ago.

Tire wear is even and not excessive
No leaks or malfunctions in sunroof or other windows.
Ride can be choppy due to the short wheel base, and this is a car that needs to be driven at a safe speed. Swerving at 70 mph on wet pavement would get dicey.

Once the paint started to give, I took the chrome off. I'm embarrassed to put nice wheels on an ashy looking car. Now the windows are up the radio is low and I park way I the back.

Appears to be other drivetrain-related issues besides the transmission so I'm bailing on the car. BTW: I'm an over 50 driver so don't hot rod it, gave it all scheduled maint and oil changes and 90% of miles were expressway. So I consider recent drivetrain issues a warning sign of further problems to come. I'd planned on keeping the car until it was time for another set of tires (probably around 150K mi.)."

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Kyle, 03/13/2009,Best Car Ever,4,"I've had my Endeavor for 4+ years and have very few complaints.  I get 18- 19mpg around town and 22-23 on the hwy.  It pulls our popup camper like it's not even there.  You will not find a mid-sized crossover with as much cargo space as the Endeavor.  I've had just two problems, both at 75K.  The window mechanism (they call it the regulator) failed on the driver's window ($250 to fix) and the ck engine light came on ($600 for O2 sensor and new plugs)."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,YACK6, 03/28/2009,A pleasant Endeavour,4,"I purchased this vehicle new from the dealership. I average 19 MPG in everyday driving. The only money I have put into it are for normal wear and tear items. I had a problem with the clear coat but the dealership took care of this at no cost to me. I have 124,000 miles on this SUV and it still looks and drives like new. It has a very responsive engine and transmission with a great highway ride. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone interested."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,gabby, 01/19/2010,Great SUV!,4,"I have had my Endeavor for 4 years now and have 115,000 miles on it. It has been one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.  It still rides very nice and I have not had any major mechanical issues.  One problem with struts right after I purchased it, but that is all. I can't recommend a vehicle more for reliability and good looks!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Cheu, 02/15/2010,Great SUV,4,"I've had my Endeavor for about 3 years now, bought it used at 48K and it now has 78K. I did alot of research before I bought it and test drove alot of SUV's before choosing it. All around it's a dependable SUV, no real problems with it, aside from the paint starting to chip on the roof racks and the extra noise you get when all the windows and sunroof are open. It's a very under rated SUV, I would have given it better rating's if not for Mitsubishi's horrible customer service. If you can tolerate the already mentioned horrible customer service, I would recommend buying an Endeavor."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,AngelaPenny, 11/04/2010,I LOVE my endeavor,4,"I am a little to in love with this car! I pack it full of people and beach stuff and head up to Tahoe with the a/c blasted and it performs beautifully. In reno NV it snows - and while everyone else is stuck on the side of the road, my endeavor just drives on past them NO PROBLEM. Because of the eclipse engine, it is fast and handles the road very well while not eating too much gas. Plenty of leg, head & cargo room for me and my tall family and all our groceries. It has been consistently reliable. The only con is I got a lemon drivers seat that I took to the dealer 6 (no joke) times to have repaired and it goes unrepaired to this day. One very hard to please person, recommends this vehicle!!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,taterlove, 04/22/2011,Love my Baby!,4,"So we bought 'My Baby' this time last year and have been in love with it! Right after purchase we did have to take it back to get the back tailgate fixed, it kept poping open. But the gas mileage and the driving and the handling is just amazing! There is noise with having the sunroof open, but I love having my music on so it doesn't bother me. Also, it fits 3 full size carseats! My friend has a 4Runner and cant do that! We've taken her halfway across the country and loved it! I just cant express how much I love my Endeavor!!!"

So I test drove one, did hours of research, came back the next day and bought one!  I am extremely pleased and happy with this SUV 16 months later.  Very comfortable leather heated seats, a blasting 6-CD changer stereo system, excellent trim and interior fit and finish with no squeaks or rattles, cool blue gauge lights, a rather torquey (although a bit raspy) V-6 engine, which moves the vehicle quickly from a dead stop and at highway speeds without much downshifting. The vehicle always feels solid and nimble, but not plodding. A very comfortable road trip vehicle!"

I bought my Endeavor, ""Endora"", in November 08 from Carmax 1) because the Lancer was totaled out and 2) because the Endeavor is more suited to what I need a vehicle to be able to do. I love the cargo space and my dog enjoys having the back compartment all to herself.
I can easily load up any of my camping gear, horse equipment or feed in the back and not worry about how the car will handle the load. I've also taken several trips across several states in her and she's handled like a charm. I LOVE this car. Even when we had a freak snow storm in Georgia I was still able to drive around."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Vaughn, 02/24/2007,Why Don't You Back Your Vehicle?,3,"This vehicle could be one of the greatest vehicles put on the road, except when problems arise no one is willing to look into the problem while the vehicle is still under warranty, God forbid they will have to pay for something that's wrong with it.  My vehicle has had a break problem since the day I drove it home.  I have to do a break job on the front every 15,000 to 18,000 miles. When I take it in for a brake job, they tell me it is because of the way I drive, but as soon as the warranty was up and I would have to pay for all the repairs, they found almost a thousand dollars worth of repairs to do.  This was with a Mitsubishi dealer and not the dealership I leased the vehicle from."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,So Comfortable!, 05/30/2007,So Comfortable to Drive! Roomy!,3,"Very comfortable.  Love the large area under the windshield, gives feeling of even more roominess.  The center button behind steering wheel works intermittently, seems like when vehicle heats up, button gets issues.  AC still blows pretty strongly when system turned to off - unusual.  Back bumper paint scratches and dings easily, plastic bumper tread raised and attaching hooks broke off, but still intact.  Black area just in front of trunk window area lost color (spotty), but covered under warranty.  Middle display for music and vents is a bit too dark - brighter should be standard.

I never ever EVER had a problem from it.  Nothing.  I could rely on it.  Also, very roomy.  I had to haul around a wheel chair and various other things and it had the room and more.  I only sold it because I needed emergency money.  My only complaint was that it really wasn't all that great on gas.  I got something around 18 MPG and that was just killing me.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,AutumnLeaves, 08/15/2019,PROS & CONS - READ THIS!! UPDATE: 05 - 15 - 2019,2,"READ THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO PURCHASE A 2004

----------------------------------------------------------------------
>>PROS:
I admit, I am overweight and many of the people in my family as well. The drivers and passengers side seats are big, very comfortable if you weigh 200-240 lbs. That's the #1 great thing about this vehicle. Comfortable and ROOMY.

The second is the A/C, it will freeze your ear lobes off!! 

Heated Drivers side and Passengers leather side seats, heats up fast but isn't super Hot, just right.

If you install a hitch, you can pull a 5x10 SA Enclosed trailer no problem, however, you need automatic breaks installed on the trailer if you have a 6x12. It can pull it but you will notice the weight there, especially going down hill on a highway. 

The brakes on the SUV are Excellent! 

Good Turn radius. 

Infinity Multi-CD changer is great and Speakers are Great. 

Last year I was sitting at a red light and was rear ended by a teen that was texting and driving. He tried to stop but still hit me while I was stopped at the light. I feel safer than the newer vehicles that have mostly plastic on them. His Prius was Totaled while mine had a small dent in my gate and frame was bent slightly. My mom and I has a little whiplash from it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>CONS:
When the Amplifier for your Radio goes bad, it will start drawing from the battery and there is no way to fix it, except replace it with another $600 amplifier which isn't even guaranteed to fix the problem. The Mechanic at Mitsubishi disconnected the amplifier which stopped it from drawing from the battery. Now you have No Radio or Bluetooth, don't buy those $60 ""clip-on2 JBL"" Bluetooth speakers at Best Buy, they suck. 

The Hydraulics in the back gate quit working, it is super heavy to lift and the window as well. 

Back Window Trim dry rots quick and window will leak in a down pour. 

The Sunroof is big and nice to have, but it has 2 tubes on the sides and they do get gunked up, no way to get rid of it without replacing them. Sunroof tubes replaced not but a year ago and already it's leaking again. Same with the back gate trim. Also replaced the whole ceiling fabric because of the sunroof tubes leaking and causing black mold. 

Transmission is going and it will cost $2000 to replace. I don't even have 100k miles on it! I do not off-road with this. I don't drive it but 2-3 days a week.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Thoughts:
Make sure it has a good paint job, because you can't resell it if you need to. Paint jobs are EXPENSIVE, unless you know someone... I would not buy this again if someone offered me another. Don't buy it. I'm looking at buying a truck, instead. The Mechanics said trucks are made for construction and those engines last forever, especially Toyota Tacoma Trucks. So that's what I am looking at. Do research for Cons before you buy, don't just read all the good stuff about a vehicle. Another thing, some of the reviews I read, the later models fixed some of the problems I had in this 2004 model.

Some food for thought:
If you buy from a private seller and they sold you a lemon, you are SOL based on what sheriff said. If you buy from a dealer, and the sold you a lemon, you have a 3-day lemon law in Florida for a refund.

Needs another set of mud guards.  Stays dirty but do not make for 2004 model. Front dashboard scratches real easy and cannot be cleaned or buffed out.

I have driven and sat in many other SUVs and our Endeavor by far tops my best experience. The Endeavor is light years better than same class SUVs and better than the Highlander and even 4Runner. It's solid in all aspects and well balanced in ride, steering, power, comfort, braking, appearance and quality.

The only quirks are that groceries in the back will fly around, no matter how slow you drive; and if you have the back window(s) down, you have to have a front window down as well or their is a very weird, unpleasant cabin pressure issue.

Gas mileage isn't very good, but I'm used to a compact.  I have found 18mpg city, but I'm not that aggressive of a driver.  The EPA claims 14 or so, which isn't true.  It will move if you put your foot down, and feels very settled even under hard acceleration.  Fuel economy disappears with aggressive driving habits.

The only maintenance we've had to do was preventive in nature.  Oil changes, replaced the tires, replaced the brakes and changed the timing belts at 100,000 miles.  The vehicle now has 115,000 and still runs as well as the day we bought it.  I HIGHLY recommend this vehicle to anyone who asks me about it.

When I drove to dealer service after 1st wreck, they checked it out and asked me if I was sure I even had a wreck. I did have to get a new (used) transmission around 120K, but that's all other than regular maintenance.  I want to keep driving to at least 200K."

The interior is a little noisy from rattles.  Common complaint.  The sound system in great!  The look hasn't changed and rightfully so.  With two kids, the back seat has room for both them and their toys (That's a plus!)  I've read complaints about the paint but haven't seen anything unusual on mine.  Also had a slight shake at 65 mph which an alignment took care of.  If you are luck enough to find one.  Get it and enjoy."

happy with my decision.  It's an 
excellent value for the money.  The

was very difficult to locate."

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,lemonjeep2, 08/22/2003,Love our Limited,4,"This is a dynamite vehicle. Very 
comfortable and enjoyable to drive. We 
test drove lots and lots of cars and did 
some research, but the choice was easy. 
This vehicle just felt much better from 
the drivers seat. It handles well, has 
great AC and stereo, and the seating is 
comfortable. The rear cargo area has a 
fair amount of room.

I was concerned about the dash after 
looking at photos, but is is really 
attractive when you see it in person. I 
previously had a Mitsubishi truck that I 
beat up for over 200,000 miles and it 
never broke down, so I hope this one runs 
as well. So far our mileage has been 
good, around 20 mpg for mixed use."

and we absolutely love it.  We went out 
on a limb, stopping to look at the 
vehicle on our way to a GMC dealer to 
look at Envoy's.  We did not have to 
look any further after seeing the 
Endeavor.  We love the exterior style 
and the roomy interior.  We get alot of 
looks and questions about the vehicle 
because there are not that many on the 
road yet...which is kind of cool. The 
ride is incredibly smooth.  I thought 
it may be bumpy or rough...I was 
wrong!  I will never regret purchasing 
the Endeavor.  A great SUV that doesn't 
break the bank."

the Endeavor by. We traded in our 01' 
Mazda Tribute. The idea was to trade up 
to something roomier, better riding and 
different. There is no comparison, the 
Mitsubishi wins hands down. The fit and 
finish are impecable. The ride is much 
like our Passat. The sound system is 
out of this world. We looked at the 
Pilot and Highlander as well and 
couldn't be more pleased with our 
choice. It is still early in the game, 
but I expect that this vehicle will 
live up to the high standards that I 
have seen so far. "

2000) that I've owned

I saw an early advertisement for the 
Endeavor.  Based on the photos and 
multimedia demos that I saw, I knew my 
wife would love it.  A day after it 
came off of the truck, we visited our 
Mitsu dealer and test drove a Silver 
XLS.  We bought it that night.  I was 
amazed at the job the Mitsu pulled 
off.  My wife really loved the deep

shifter. NO on several options that are 
not available - memory seats, garage 
door remote, third seat option, auto 
headlights, GPS, side curtains. Dash 
and door materials look cheap although 
I like style of dash overall. Could use 
a bit more oomph under the hood - 
adequate for city driving but lacking a 
bit up those hills. For the price, a 
good vehicle and a good buy. A few 
options could make this vehicle one 
heck of a situation."

a masculine buldgey line style that is 
not the common slim doorme too for the

the Honda Pilot, Mitsubishi Endeavor and

Endeavor had a better ride than the rest
of the bunch. The Pilot has a third
seat, but, we did not think it would be
a smart idea to put our kids in the
third seat for safety reasons.  The
Highlander was a nice SUV but the style
was a little outdated.  We were able to
buy the Endeavor a few dollars below
invoice, finance it for 5 yrs at 0% and
 get 7 yr free roadside assistance.  In

the styling, the interior, fit and

also impressed with the value compared 
to the others ( especially, when you 
consider the current $2,000 rebate ).  
By far, IMO, the Endeavor is the best 
in it's class.   This, at first, was 
difficult for me to accept because I 
am  a big fan of both Honda and

that did not look like a mini-van.  I 
think Mitsubishi has accomplished 
this.  The AWD handles nicely in the 
rain and has ""some"" kick. It seems

this vehicle and just a bit smaller 
interior then the Explorer, you cannot 
go wrong.  I have the XLS and the All 
Wheel Drive is great!  Do not pass this 
one by when shopping....you cannot go 
wrong, this is a superb SUV with a 
carlike drive."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,SYCAMORE, 11/10/2003,HAPPY_SUV,4,"WE ONLY HAVE THIS XLS ENDEAVOR LESS 
THAN A MONTH AND SO FAR, MY WIFE AND 
SELF WERE ENJOYING EVERY MINUTE OF IT. 
ACCELERATION IS VERY GOOD, SOUND SYSTEM 
IS GREAT AND RIDE IS VERY COMFORTABLE 
SINCE IT RUNS LIKE A CAR."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Susan Wasyk, 11/11/2003,This is a great car!,5,"I was looking at the Honda Pilot, but 
this offered me the same, but at a 
better price.  The interior is very 
roomy, especially for those with long 
legs, the sound system is great and is 
very comfortable driving, especially on 
long trips.  I would recommend this car 
to everyone."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,gofast, 11/13/2003,Drives like a car....,5,"I've owned a Ford Explorer and a Jeep 
Grand Cherokee and really liked them 
both; however, this is a different kind 
of SUV.  It drives soooooo much nicer 
than the SUVs designed for off roading.

This car is simply a blast to drive.  
You can push it hard into turns, it 
brakes great and the transmission is 
great for curvy roads.

If you want a SUV that drives great--
this is it.  If you want an SUV that is 
great off-roading--buy something else"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,zzeeker, 11/15/2003,LOVE IT!!,4,"I have only had the vehicle for a 
month and a half.  I am trying to find 
something wrong with it but I just 
can't.  The truck is solid as a rock 
and handles beautiful.  I love the 
more radical look of it.  So far I am 
extremely happy with my purchase."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Carl H., 11/16/2003,Awesome Smooth Powerful Ride!,4,"I wasn't even considering this car! I 
had been researching the Honda CRV, 
and was sold (in my mind) that it was 
the best car for my needs. I test 
drove the CRV, the Hyundai Santa Fe, 
and at my wife's urging, the Mitsu 
SUV's: Outlander, Montero Sport, and 
Endeavor. The smooth, powerful, STABLE 
ride the Endeavor has is what sold me! 
Every time I climb into my Endeavor, I 
know I made the right decision. I've 
had it 2.5 months. I recently went 
back to the dealership,and noticed 
that all their LS models (like ours) 
were SOLD OUT! My wife and I love it 
so much, about a month ago, WE BOUGHT 
A SECOND ONE! "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Don Vito, 11/06/2003,Super SUV,5,"excellent, fun to drive, very reliable, 
quick, the best SUV I have ever 
owned....recomended highly!!!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Chiefs22, 11/16/2003,Endeavor,5,"For the price of the lower model, LS, 
the consumer has many options already 
in the car.  Fun to drive, very smooth 
on the road, especially at higher 
speeds.  With its exterior lines, the 
new Endeavor gets plenty of head turns."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Snoopy64, 11/17/2003,Excellent Value!,5,"Bought my new 04' Endeavor for myself 
as a birthday present. I looked at a 
Durango, but it came only in an 8 cyl. 
and I didn't want a gas guzzler, but 
still pretty nice. Highly considered an 
04' 4Runner, but Toyota has a habit of 
adding on options a consumer my not 
want, therefore raising the sticker 
anywhere from $1000-$3000 and out of my 
desired price range and budget. THEN, 
one day I drove the Endeavor LS FWD, 
and it drove like a car. Comparable 
ride to the 4Runner SR5, but about 
$4500.00 less with a better warranty, 
and tires for life. My wife fell in 
love with it on the first drive, and 
enjoyed the roomy feeling."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,ALRON, 11/24/2003,Excellent Value for the Money,4,"I purchased this vehicle for my wife 2 
weeks ago and after driving it a few 
times I have noticed the great value 
that you get around for mid $22K with  
incentives and invoice pricing. It 
drives like a car and have features 
which are considered extras in 
competing models. It feels very solid 
and stable in highway cruising. 
Interior design blends in a 
contemporary pattern."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,tonym1963, 05/18/2005,love this ride,4,I have owned my Endeavor for almost 2 years I love it.  I would like a little more variety in option packages but it came nicely equiped.  I think the site lines inside are 2nd to none and the ride is like a car.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Scool, 11/25/2003,Endeavor,5,"This SUV drives like a sedan.  The ride 
is very smooth and quiet.  This car has 
big cargo space along with fold down 
rear seat that goes lower to level with 
cargo."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,ATL-L, 11/28/2003,Loving it.,5,"Previous owner of an Explorer...then a 
Lexus sports car. Missed the SUV so 
tried to find something that I really 
wanted. The Endeaver drove like my car 
and had some things better than 
before. After test driving the 
Explorer after the Endeavor it was a 
no-brainer. The Endeavor is 
wider...more grounded. better handling 
and just more comfortable."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Klubwithak, 11/29/2003,Mitsubishi Endevaor,5,"This is a great SUV and I recommend

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,stdb, 11/29/2003,endeavor,4,"My experience with the Endeavor has 
been great.  I love the way it handles 
and how smooth the ride is.  The 
visibility while driving is excellent.  
Comfort is a big factor and the 
Endeavor is very comfortable even for 
long drives.  The power lets you know 
its safe for passing others on the 
road.  I'm sure my next vehicle will be 
another Endeavor."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Valrud, 12/01/2003,Endearing Endeavor,4,"A solid and sporty upfort vehicle.  No 
rel frills, just plain honest 
performance and style.  After over 
3500 miles, no speaks, rattles or 
noises.  Vehicle came with NO exerior 
defects.  Stays on the road, for an 
SUV type vehicle like glue has got 
hold,  I like the crossocer typr 
suspersion and frame configuration.

Overall a pleaseure to drive and own."

awesome.The gadgets are cool,the 
comphort is desireable."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,UVADarden03, 11/21/2003,Ron's Endeavor XLS AWD,4,"Driving is a pleasure. Love the sound 
system and the performance though road 
noise can be somewhat of a bother. The 
design is great though the finish 
quality on the dashboard looks like 
cheap plastic. Wish traction control 
and stability control came standard and 
had a 5-speed auto instead of a 4-speed."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Craig, 06/10/2005,awesome,5,"This is the best SUV on the market in this price range.  I have had a 4Runner, Trailblazer, Xterra, and this Endeavor is better in every way over all the others."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Rich Lucido, 11/22/2003,"Good Car, Great Price",4,"Bought the LS FWD for just under $21k 
and there is simply no other midsize 
SUV comparable in that price range.  
Drives incredibly well and has more 
than enough power for daily driving.  
The lack of ABS is a serious drawback, 
as is the automatic locking doors.  
Day time headlights would have been 
nice too.  The build quality on it is 
much better than our 03 Trailblazer LT 
and it has more low end punch,a much 
nicer ride and despite being a smaller 
automobile it feels bigger.  An 
extremely nice car, at a very 
reasonable price."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Starfather, 06/14/2005,"After 30K, Still Luvn' it...",4,"Broke 30K today on the '04 Endeavor, my favorite car still. I have averaged 19 mpg, mostly at 65 on hwy, have had only two problems, both under warranty and fixed right away. First was odd whistle, sounded like belt but was actually something in drive shaft. Second was fuel injector sensor, they replaced injector. I installed K&N air filter, rear mud guards,and a standard black steel mesh screen for lower air intake, to keep rocks out of radiator, Great car!  "

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Melissa in CT, 12/15/2003,Good solid vehicle,4,"We test drove the Nissan Murano, the 
Honda Pilot, and the Saturn Vue, of all 
of these, we enjoyed the Endeavor the 
most.

Looking out of the windows to check 
your blind spots is hard especially if 
you are short.  However, the extra 
large mirrors make up for it.  "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Dawn , 07/21/2005,I love my Endeavor,4,"I have only had my vehicle for 45 days, but it has impressed me with the lack of rattles and squeeks.  For a V6 in really has a lot of get up and go.  I am very pleased with my purchase."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,joe middendorf, 12/22/2003,endeaver tire issue,4,"Have had this vehicle for about two 
months. Had to take it back to the 
dealer several times to address an 
issue with th front end vibrating. 
They eventually had to replace all of 
the tires because they were ""out of 
spec."" Recently have noticed that when 
I stop and hold the brake pedal it 
begins to get soft. I haven't taken it 
in for this problem yet. Other than 
these two items it seems to be all we 
expected."

COOL DESIGN"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,An Average consumer, 12/27/2003,Endeavors are awesome vehicles!!,5,"Ive had my Endeavor for about 3 months 
and it has easily been the best SUV I 
have ever owned. It handles better and 
is faster than the BMW X5 that I test 
drove before I bought my Endeavor. Was 
easily the best SUV I drove during the 
purchase process. From the drivers 
seat you get an excellent view of the 
road. Do not buy any other SUV without 
giving the Endeavor a try, you will 
not regret it."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,applelwa, 12/28/2003,Nice Vehicle,4,"Taking into consideration the 
discounted cost of the endeavor verses 
other SUVs, the unique style, quality, 
performannce and enjoyment to drive, 
you have a great combination for 
ownership. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Lancetroy, 08/28/2005,"Endeavor in Vancouver, BC",4,"Performance-wise, this SUV is outstanding. I like the car-like handling and of course, as most of you know by now, it's torquey 225-hp engine."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Manneth, 12/30/2003,Greate SUV,5,"This is my second SUV and when we test 
drove it, just fell in love with it. 
The handling is very good. The engine 
is a V6 with with enough hp for its 
size. Lots of leg room in both front 
and back. I have to say it does drive 
very much like a car with a very 
smooth ride. This is truly a driving 
machine."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Starfather, 01/04/2004,Leader of the Pack,5,"I wanted to buy what I considered the 
best mid-size and mid-price SUV for a 
tall person. I spent 3 months and test 
drove 11 SUV's. I read all the guides 
and compared all the specs. The 
Endeavor won on power, space, handling, 
quality control,ride, and features. 
Overall best SUV for under 30,000!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,englishtoy, 01/05/2004,2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor - Bakersfield,4,"I had a Montero Sport and this car has 
more room, power and class.  The 
interior has all the amenities you 
could ask for with power seat, seat 
heaters, and 6 CD changer and the motor 
has power to spare.  I have an 
octogenarian living with me and the 
access and rear seating are superb."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,RBENSON, 01/06/2004,I LOVE IT,4,"I WENT FROM DRIVING A SPORTS CAR TO A 
SPORTS UTILITY VEHICLE AND I LOVE IT.
I CHOSE THE ENDEAVOR OVER MANY OTHER IN 
IT'S CLASS DUE TO PRICE, LOOK, AND 
RATINGS. IT HAS LOTS OF ROOM AND VERY 
SMOOTH DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Owner, 09/23/2005,Very Good SUV,5,The 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor  is an awesome SUV. It has great power.  Some SUVs feel sluggish.  Don't be suprised if you have to say goodbye to that term when your driving this truck!
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,McCloskey, 01/07/2004,"I was sold, where do I sign!!!",4,"I have had my Endeavor for 8 months so 
far I have had to replace the rear 
differential (service bulletin) due to 
between 25-40mph nioses that sound like 
they are coming from engine. The 
acceleration is EXCELLENT. The price 
wasn't bad, I test drove the Pilot I 
just didn't like how it ran. Once I 
drove the Endeavor I was sold. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,mishel63, 01/16/2004,Endeavor,4,"I really like the look and handling of 
the Endeavor.  However, there are a 
few standard features that I miss from 
previous vehicles.  Heated mirrors. 
Auto locks at a certain speed for 
security reasons.  Otherwise, it is a 
wonderful vehicle to own.  Great on 
Gas!  Plenty of cargo room."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Lauren M, 01/17/2004,The Endeavor ROCKS!,4,"This is the third Mitsubishi that I've 
owned...two Eclipses before the 
Endeavor. There's obviously a huge 
difference between sports cars and SUVs 
but the Endeavor doesn't ride like I 
thought an SUV would. It's so, the 
interior is so spacious asmooth and the 
ammenities are astounding. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,clr5671, 01/19/2004,Awesome ride,4,"From the timew a test drove it, I loved 
it.  It is a great ride.  Comfortable

gotten a lot of compliments on the 
exterior and interior design. The 
performance I like as well, specially 
when taking a turn. "

real deal. The engine surprisingly 
quick and reactive and ride smooth. 
Good legroom and great looking dash! 
Keep it up Mitsubishi...Honda and 
Toyota may have their work cutout in 
the mid-size SUV arena in 2004! "

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,luckyjedi, 01/31/2004,fun!,5,"I just have fun driving this thing. 
Its a great SUV. It does everything I 
need it to do and it makes me feel 
like I'm in a car. I went around 
looking for a SUV for 3 weeks doing 
major research. Looked at Murano, 
4runner, Pilot, Explorer, Jeep, and a 
bunch more but settled on the 
Endeavor. The moment I saw it I had a 
great feel for it and did my research 
and found it was a solid vehicle and 
the rest is history.

BTW try not to trust too much of the 
editor's opinions. The most accurate 
information you can get it from 
consumers like me and everyone else 
posting here. You can get a great feel 
for what the vehicle is like by 
reading forums."

perfect. I would strongly recomend 
this vehicle to anyone interested in a 
SUV.  "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,smartbuyer, 02/06/2004,can't beat the value of this machine,4,"Best bang for the buck of any mid-size 
SUV I test drove, 0% financing to boot. 
Great leather heated seats, super 
300+watt stereo, a head turner when 
compared to the competition. Be careful 
in fast acceleration, lotsa torque 
steer. Who said Mitsubishi isn't a Tier 
One automaker? "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,apct, 02/08/2004,Reality check on this model,4,"Compared this SUV to the others 
expecially the Honda Pilot.  Side by 
side the Endeavor looks and sounds 
more solid than the Pilot.  Bigger 
stero knobs for easy control on the 
road, both heated seats, cheaper 
options and more base options.  Found 
several Pilots at auto shows with 
busted seat controls."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Meantiger74, 02/09/2004,Be careful,4,"My Endeavor has 7K+ miles now.  Around
6K miles, I heard a whisling sound on
the right side of the car when driving
45-55mph.  I brought it to a local
Mit-dealer and had them check.  What
they found is abnormal sound from the
transmission.  This is really let me
down.  Besides, Mit. says that I can get
17 mpg in city and 21 mph on highway. 
This is not true b/c my Endeavor gives
me 16.5 mph from driving mostly on
highway. Everything else is great!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Razorback in Tulsa, 02/13/2004,Love it.,4,"Have loved the Endeavor ever since our 
first test drive, finally bought one 
when our dealer made us an offer that 
was several hundred $$ lower than any 
Tulsa dealership.  Wife is primary 
driver, we all absolutley love the 
vehicle.  Great for family trips and 
for errands around town."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,Capt Zams, 02/15/2004,Best Car I Have Ever Owned,4,"I bought this car for my wife after 
buying a 2003 Outlander.  I love 
everything about this car.  The ride 
is similar to a big Audi or Mercedes 
and the acceleration is better than 
the Audi A4s I've owned in the past.  
Combine the performance with the great 
utility, luxury and safety and this 
car is in my opinion the best SUV on 
the market."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,ElleCristine, 02/16/2004,LOVE IT,4,"Im enjoying my purchase.  This drives 
like a car, handles well and is unique 
on the road of the usual SUV's.  It's 
roomy inside and has side airbags and 
the DVD keeps the kids quiet on long

recommend you test drive this one.  Was 
NOT overly impressed with the 
dealership after purchase."

it. Every part of the vehicle is smooth 
mechanically and design wise.  It is 
new to 2004 in the USA but for the 
price I think you get style, comfort 
and reliability for less than you would 
pay for BMW, Lexus, or Mercedes.  A 
caution for those not looking into 
buying a new vehicle, if you drive it 
you'll want to buy it."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,DawnForth, 02/23/2004,I really enjoy my Endeavor,4,"I've had my Endeavor now since 12/03

say very much for the dealership 
(Gillman Mitusbishi in Houston DON'T 
EVER GO TO THEM - GO TO CONROE IF YOU 
WANT A GOOD DEAL & LIVE IN THE HOUSTON 
AREA)
The style is very comfortable, fuel 
economy is better than most (gets 17/23 
which isn't too shabby compared to some 
of the SUV's nowadays), doesn't have 
huge height to it like the Montero 
Sports, and it's very luxurious.  I 
mean you'd be surprised, but not bad 
for your money.  I highly reccomend the 
Endeavor.  Regrets?  Yeah I wish I 
would have maybe checked into 7 seaters 
instead of 5.  Oh well, always next 
time."

person they know who goes in for an 
oil change and drives away in a new 
car. I couldn't help it, it was love 
at first sight.
We first met last Christmas. The 
Endeavor was parked under a huge 
Christmas tree at a strip mall and 
after staring at it for over 15 
minutes, I had to ask the owner about 
it's performance. She was pleased and 
I was drooling. In keeping with the 
rules of infatuation, I got home and 
looked up all the info I could about 
the object of my affection. Almost 3 
months later, I take my 1 year old car 
in for an oil change and drive home in 
my new Endeavor."

Toyota), but the Mitsubishi Endeavor 
LTD AWD kept calling me back.  I 
couldn't believe the comfort and

SUV to drive.  It's pretty quick and 
responsive.  The back end is a little 
high for putting things in the trunk.I 
wish it offered a few more  interior 
upgrades, maybe power seats on the 
passenger side and I miss the keyless 
entry key pad on the driver door.Aside 
from that, I'm really enjoying it and

mitsubishi,endeavor,2004,luvmyendeavor, 02/28/2004,Love my Endeavor,5,"I absolutely love my endavor! I've had 
some problems with my dealership and 
the quality of service. My stereo went 
out after about two months and I had to 
get a new one. I wish the antenna was 
retractable. But otherwise, the ride is 
smooth, the interior is wonderful and I 
get so many looks from other drivers.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,A A, 05/29/2016,most reliable car I've owned,5,"2005 Endeavor.  Purchased in 2008, is now 2016, so I've had the car 8 years and put 70k miles on it.  Acceleration is adequate, as well as handling and braking.  I'm not going to let this vehicle get out of my grasp until it is worn out.  Have done nothing except routine maintenance (oil, brakes, belts, battery), all done myself, and always easy.  Only repairs have been replacing the oxygen sensors.  Opted to have the timing belt changed, and mechanic mentioned it's one of the quickest timing belt jobs he's done. (which means you don't pay for a lot of labor!).  My ONLY complaint is the lack of an aux input on the stereo, and difficulty of replacing the stereo with an aftermarket unit.  Like the title states, this has been the most reliable of the 15+ cars I've owned in my life.

Update, still the most reliable car I've ever owned.  She's starting to show her age, and things you expect to wear out by 140K are wearing out.  I'll fix those things, and keep it till it falls apart.

Update.  Now at 155K.  Had tie rod ends replaced.  Everything else is still going strong.  Still keeping this car until it stops running.

Update 12/2019.  After having the car for 11+ years, I finally let her go.  She was finally starting to sound a little clunky when changing between drive and reverse.  Sad to see the car go, but sold it to family in need of reliable cheap transport.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Tanya, 02/24/2016,Dependable Vehicle,5,"We bought our Endeavor with about 75,000 miles on it in 2010. We have driven it across the country and back a few times and we just love it! It currently has 181,000 miles on it and is still going strong. We have only had to do routine maintenance on it except for one thing. The air conditioner started to drain into the vehicle instead of outside but we took it to the dealership and only ended up paying a couple hundred dollars. Other than that it has been a super reliable vehicle.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,marie0124, 07/30/2014,BEST VEHICLE EVER PURCHASED,5,I have owned my 2005 Endeavor for approximately 5 years now. I first thought it was a jeep from viewing from the street. i went to the car lot and was surprised it was not a jeep. I took it for a test drive up and down hills. It was a smooth ride and was easy to handle. I have purchased many cars in my life and found this one to be easy on maintenance only needing regular oil change.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Kristin Sharum, 01/31/2016,Saved my brother and sons life.,4,"When we bought the car in the summer of 2014, we rushed it.. I recently lost my car because of some engine problem and was looking to buy something fast. I went to a used sales lot and picked this up. I owned it for a few months and it was great. One problem with it, it had some engine noise that even my brother mechanic couldn't figure out what it was. But other than that, it was fine. Its not the best in snow with regular tires, I feel as we could get stuck on a leaf. But, the thing sure did pick up and go if needed in the summer. Sadly, I lost my car in April of 2015 when my brother was taking my son to school and they were hit head on. Surprisingly, the vehicles interior only had a pushed up dash and the vents slightly broken. The car was totaled, but at least my family was safe. The vehicle had reallyyyy cold air and hot heat.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Larry, 10/26/2010,Great Experience,4,"I have had my Endeavor for 5 1/2 years now and at 95,000 miles had my first problem--not even a new car bug. (have kept all service, minor and major up to date). Just had to have propeller shaft and bearing assembly replaced due to bad bearings.  But fully covered by 100,000 Mile powertrain warranty.  Feel great this is the only issue in 95K miles!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Brian Glover, 03/01/2018,We Love Our Endeavors!!,5,"We loved our Endeavor so much that we bought another one! His and hers! We live in Northeast Ohio and get a lot of snow - the all wheel drive Endeavors have been awesome in the snow! You just need to make sure that you keep good tires on them - so every September we go out and do the quarter test, yes quarter, not penny since we live in such a snow belt area and if we can see their head, then we purchase a set of new tires. We currently own a 2006 and a 2005. We bought them used from a Mitsubishi Dealership back in 2011 and then the other in 2012. They run fantastic, no engine or transmission problems, but due to the weather around here and their age, we are dealing with some rust issues - right now the 2005 is running very loud due to rust making a hole in the exhaust system. Unfortunately, they stopped making the Endeavors in 2011, but if you are o.k. with used and can get your hands on one, we highly recommend them, especially if you live in a snowy area.

4 years since then. No problems at 50,000 plus miles.
Comfy long distances.
Hwy mileage is very good, not so much in the city.
AWD runs great off-road, including the sand
--fun!
The least i like about it, noticeable muffler from the back of the 
SUV, and U-turns are wide."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Alex, 06/22/2009,Perfect Family car,4,"I have 3 kiddos, and I can fit 2 car seats and 1 booster in the back seat, and the kiddos love it. This along with a great ride, huge interior space, cool looks (for a suv) and so far, a blast to drive.  This car also performs well off road, tested right after purchase, I went about 20 miles in medium to rough offroad with very good results. The only quirk was that the ABS goes crazy when you only have 2 3 wheels on the ground. Nothing bad at all, just use the brakes as you would but the sound can be unnerving at first.  First long road trip was wonderful, the stereo sounds good, and if you want an mp3 player, just pick up an fm transmitter / mp3 player. Cost me $45."

In the last 6.5 years, I have put 111,000 miles on it and spent under $800 getting all repairs done.
Not bad considering I am always on the road.

All the parts were ordered by the dealer and were installed without any trouble.  We have 39k on the SUV now and have had Zero problems.  Our dealer is Lee's Summit Mitsubishi.  They have done a really nice job of taking care of our vehicle.  Most of our mileage is in town family and grocery hauling.  The vehicle does everything that we want it to do. We average about 18 mpg.  On the highway about 20/21. I am about ready to buy new tires as the stock tires are almost gone now.  We don't miss the 3rd row seat as we seldom haul more than four people.  "

Endeavor had everything I wanted and then some, plus the added 0% APR deal. Easy choice! Still prefer the exterior of the Toyota, but wouldn't trade my heated seats, steering wheel audio controls and other bells & whistles now for anything!  As far as value, I definitely feel I got the biggest bang for my buck. Extremely satisfied overall."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Russ, 06/23/2005,Best Value!,4,"I have owned several domestic and import SUVs, this is by far the best value! The ride is second to none, quiet and powerful. I love the techtronics shift, it is more responsive than the one in my wifes 2006 VW Jetta. The Endeavor has solid, in control feel over the road, be it twisting back roads or the highway. It has a solid SAFE feel. It's handling in foul weather is superb. The cabin is very comfortable. I love the milage, you do not need a V8 to get performance, this vehicle seems to have adequate power towing my 17' boat. I am very pleased and purchased this vechicle after driving the Toyota Highlander, Honda CRV and Pilot, Ford Explorer and Ford Escape. My Endeavor was the best buy!"

I wish there was a switch to turn of the daytime running lights when I'm just sitting in the car listening to the radio.  The back seats don't fold completely flat.  The rear passenger area should have a dome light.  The dash texture just traps dirt and dust.  The A/C vents cannot be individually switched off.  There are no vents in the back seat.  The gearshift indicators are not illuminated.  If we have that little computer in the front, why not have an available OnsSar, GPS, or nav system available? Or estimated MPG calcular? Or optional satelite radio? "

The motor is so ""torquie"" that often I spin tires when trying to get going quickly. The seats are nice and the added comfort of driving a limited with side frame re-inforcements makes the vehicle seem more truck-like. This is a nice one indded but the usual inconveniences from a manufacturer like Mitsubishi are there too. Molding, Molding, Molding.....Stuff does have a way of popping off of this thing for seemingly no reason at all. Sunroof privacy cover handle, radio/ ac knobs...Screw covers in the luggage rack..

mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Ronald, 10/27/2007,Sleeper SUV,4,I have had absolutely no problems with my 2005 Endeavor LS AWD.  It has plenty of power and is comfortable. It looks sporty and overall build quality is very good. It handles very well and is a fairly quiet ride.  It has not missed a beat and other than scheduled maintenace it has operated flawlessly. The AWD system is inferior to my Subaru.  The stock tires may be part of the problem.  I will install new snow tires and see if traction improves.

I had the sunroof fixed last year (leaking) and a power steering pump put on about 2 years ago.  I currently have water leaking into the driver's floor board and we have not been able to find the source.  Probably haven't put more than $500 in parts/labor into it other than ordinary maintenance. (oil change/tires, brakes, etc...) I put a hitch on it and pulled trailer/bike 2000K and I would do it again tomorrow.  I enjoyed the power at take-off and merging, hehe.   I've never hesitated to drive it to work when co-workers called in for snowy roads.  We were the only ones that got out of the mud soaked valley when all others got stuck.  (People sat on that side of the road to watch the show :) )  If I could buy this car brand new (but with the more modern features of Bluetooth and aux jack) I would definitely consider it.

It has a lot of cargo space in the back and the seats are easy to fold down to create even more.  I love the power this vehicle has and the transmission is very responsive.  The transmission does make a wining noise in warmer weather. This is a known issue with them - can't be fixed, so I deal with it.  It is very comfortable on long trips.  I question its durability, though.  The interior is very cheap.  The fabric, although comfortable, is already showing significant wear.

The Endeavor is perfect. It has all the power of a Porche (I know, it's sounds like an exaggeration, but just drive one...you'll see), the roominess of a bus (now there's the real exaggeration), the feel of a space ship, and the stereo system!

This is a incredible amount of car for the money, and it is not your standard SUV box.  Outstanding reliability, distinctive styling inside and out, and solid performance make this a serious contender for SUV shoppers.  The Limited edition's leather seats and premium audio system make this a posh ride, and the AWD lets me take this anywhere -- sand, snow, you name it.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Walter Sprowl, 11/12/2004,My endeavor,4,"It is turning out to be the best 
vehicle that I have owned and this is 
about my 8th Mitsubishi."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Chad Arnold, 12/17/2004,Move over Honda Pilot,4,"I can't be more happy with my 2004 
Endeavor. I researched both the Honda Pilot 
and the Toyota 4Runner / HIghlander. What I 
found was I can have a new SUV with a 
beautiful ride, sleek look and plenty 
of comforts AND not get killed in the 
pocket. The AWD system has been an 
added pleasure. The 315 Infinity 
system has a gorgeous sound. The ride 
is very smooth with minimal road 
noise. The warranty is out of this 
world. The look of the interior with 
the LCD displays and blue lit 
backgrounds are both futuristic and 
beautiful with a nice metal finish. 
Not having the 3rd row seat is a 
drawback for some. I don't need it. It 
also makes the 2nd seats roomier and 
provides nice cargo space. A lot of 
vehicle for the money!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Mandy, 01/03/2005,My Ruby,4,"These SUV's are for the people that 
want a SUV but feel comfort in driving 
a car. This vehicle is really nice and 
it is roomy. I had 3 children in the 
back seat and they still had plenty of 
room even with all of them in carseats. 
Definitely recommend to someone that is 
looking for an SUV."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,elenagracia, 02/05/2005,solid alternative to standard SUVs,4,"I did quite a bit of research before I decided to purchase my first SUV, and after test driving a few, I was afraid I would have to make the jump to the luxury SUVs when I decided to try the Mitsubishi Endeavor.  This is a beautiful SUV with distinctive exterior and interior styling, and an excellent carlike ride and drive.  It feels really solid -- being a bit longer and wider than the Honda Pilot - - and takes me everywhere (with its AWD) safely and securely.  This trim level feels lush and spacious, and carries five adults and plenty of cargo comfortably.  The Endeavor is a stylish, powerful alternative to the standard SUV box -- it's definitely worth a look."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Allie, 02/04/2005,fun & easy to drive,5,Nought this instead of the Highlander because of the warranty...it held up great when someone turned into the passenger side. More than enough space for 4 good sized adults cruising arount town or camping with friends.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,pmg, 02/19/2005,best ever,4,"Handles like a car, and has all the comfort of a luxury vehicle.  Love the visibility.  A pleasure to drive, and the AWD is 100% reliable in any weather."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Gary, 02/24/2005,Love it,4,"I find my Endeavor to be cavernous inside, mid sized outside and a good looking reliable vehicle in between."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Endeavor, 03/05/2005,happy to review,4,"Fun to drive and very solid.  The added ""stick shift"" feature makes it even more exciting and is really great for control on ice and snow."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Happy Endeavor, 03/05/2005,Happy Endeavor,5,"We've owned a Land Cruiser, 4-Runner, Blazer, Explorer and Expedition. The Endeavor is THE BEST! I think it's a well-kept secret. Nothing but praise for all of it...the ride's great!  People actually ask us what kind of car it is and can't get over all that's included...especially the loooonnnng warranty!!  Give it another year and you'll see more on the road...darn it!:)"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Dungeoner, 03/07/2005,It was this or a Pilot...,5,"And I chose the Endeavor. I can honestly say, I'll never second guess my decision either. The vehicle drives like a dream. I've driven the Pilot, Highlander, Trailblazer, Durango & Grand Cherokee(V8). All were wonderful, but only the Pilot & Endeavor drove like I wanted my wife's SUV to drive. The torque in this thing needs to be felt to be appreciated. It might not have seating for 7 or 8 people/children, but the 5 that do fit, do so comfortably. The steering is tight & responsive & the drive is stellar. If I had the funds, my wife & myself would be driving one. Everything seems solidly made & built. If I had to gripe about something, it would be the gas mileage on this capable engine."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Ed, 03/12/2005,Just got it !!!,4,"I drove it in deep snow and ice in Buffalo N.Y. My Endeavor is quiet comfortable, peppy, handles the road great. It turns heads."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Terry Dierks, 03/18/2005,Love my Endeavor,4,"We purchased our 2004 AWD Endeavor Limited for my wife to drive in November, 2004.  We drove it from Kansas City to Atlanta and back at Christmas.  I drove the whole way and never felt tired or uncomfortable. It is the perfect size for us inside and out.  I liked it so much that I purchased an Endeavor for myself."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Fredi, 03/18/2005,Endeavour does it all!,5,"My 2004 Mitsbushi Endeavour is the most practical, all-around vehicle I have ever owned.  It holds my greyhound, my granddaughter, a stroller and 2 other passengers with no proboems.  I like the fact that the rear window works independently of the rear door.  I especially like the upholstery - it is attractive and TOUGH!  Overall, the best car I have ever owned.  "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Gil, 03/19/2005,Fun SUV,4,Top Quality.  Fun to drive.  Great handling and road stability. I don't have any fears of 'tipping'.  Would buy another one.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,DEROCK, 03/24/2005,Great Reliable SUV for Smart Shoppers,4,No complaints - I am a Honda fan all the way but since I test drove this SUV to now I love it - smart buy over the Toyota Highlander all day long and the Honda Pilot if you do not need the third row seat. Test drive and you will see!
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Debbie Reeder, 04/26/2005,Best New Car on the Market,5,The Endeavor's design and detail were clearly thought through thoroughly by the car designers.  The designers were truly thinking about what the consumer would like to have in an automobile.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,ryan, 05/10/2005,Amazing piece of equiptment in every way,5,The Mitsubishi Endeavor is thrilling to drive and the inside is a major treat all the way from the power seats/heated seats to the amazingly nice blue gauges and console.  It is just simply unbeatable for the price and quality.  Mitsubishi just is crushing other competitors with style and performance now adays.  In my opinion Mitsubishi in general has some of the most kind and caring people of of course awesome cars. I'd reccomend an Endeavor to anyone.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Melissa, 05/23/2005,2004 Mits Endeavor XLS,4,"I like it a lot - great on gas for an SUV.  Sometimes not thrilled with a loose sounding noise from the engine when accelerating, and the interior has a ton of wind noise.  Also having minor problem with the trim on the bumper (under the liftgate.)  But overall a nice car.  Depreciated WAY too fast though - unsure why."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Mike, 06/02/2005,2005 Endeavor,4,"All around great vehicle.  Great in snow (AWD).  Very repsonsive and sporty, but also absorbs the bumps in the road very well.  I would buy this vehicle again."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Mark Breithaupt, 06/04/2005,Initial impressions/Endeavor,5,I had a radiator leak that was repaired promptly. Towing was quick. Customer service was fast and courteous. I like the ride and feel of the interior. Any concerns I had are put to rest by a positive experience with this first repair.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Interam, 06/16/2005,Ojeda's Opinion,4,"I had a Mitsubishi Montero for 10 years. I decided to change to another Mitsubishi as the experience had been fine. I went to see different alternatives though and still decided to stay within Mitsubishi. I did not know about the Endeavor until I saw it in a Car Fair and when seating in front of the wheel and feeling the inside I said this is the SUV I want. I have enjoyed it so far. Good response, confortable, fast in highways, stable. However not an economic vehicle."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Tom Picciani, 06/16/2005,Good vehicle,4,Overall this is a great SUV. It's snappy. It's manuverable. It handles 75 cu ft. of cargo and it has good visiblity our all windows.  Overall I love this vehicle! I'll get another when I tire of this one. 
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,amy morris, 07/05/2005,I love this car!,5,"I bought the Endeavor because I needed a safe and reliable car for my family. I have two small children and this car is perfect. It has a hugh amount of space in the back (enough to fit my double jogger with room to spare), and has all the amenities a family car should have. Front and side airbags, anti-lock brakes, DVD player, leather interior(which is great for those spills), it is so fun to drive and I really feel safe. I love this car!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,;Harris Reisbaum, 07/15/2005,I would by another,4,"I have the Endevor for 2 years and 40,000 miles.  I love it.  Roomy, reliable, great looking.  Peppy. I am an outside salesman and am able to strech out and do my work in the back seat.  I have had no problems with it and I enjoy driving it"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,facciman, 07/20/2005,The 2005 Endeavor,4,"The Endeavor is all that it is suppose to be, and more.  Mileage could be a little better, however.  I believe that it is one of the best values around.  Low end torque is amazingly similar to my BMW 528i."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Joyce Anatra, 09/04/2005,Blind spot,4,"Only one draw back, between the windshield corners and the front doors, thereis a blind spot that you have to get use to and physically adjust to compensate. Other then that, it is a very well built vehicle. I would recomend the Endeaver to my friends and familly."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,mitsulover, 09/07/2005,Why I will Never Buy Another Car,5,I have had nothing but excellent experiences with this vehicle!  I live in snow country NY and my Endevor doesn't even know that it is there!  I go all over my rugged terrain yard and I love how much room is available inside.  This is a great feature with kids!
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,Gary, 11/30/2005,Love it,4,"My 2005 Mitsubishi Endeavor's ride is secure and stable. The road noise can be a little harsh, but I feel safe in this vehicle. The versatility has been useful, carrying everything from groceries to furniture. My only beef with the vehicle is the premium fuel requirement."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,RYAN, 02/09/2006,Endeavor is Built to Endure,5,"Overall I have had my Mitsubishi Endeavor now for about a year and have put about 15,000 miles on it.  So far it has had no problems what so ever.  I have been on many different trips, some distances of 700 miles.  I also have been on many back roads and country areas and it still performs perfectly.  The snow is nothing in this thing, you have no problems getting around.  Only thing I wish was that  the interior was a little nicer, such as an improved dash and seats.  But overall I think its my favirote SUV under $40,000."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,northern lite, 05/13/2006,So Far So Good,4,"I have had a very good experience with the first 12,000 miles in my Mitsubishi Endeavor. It gets up to 19 mpg highway and 17 in town."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2005,dude2, 09/09/2006,Good SUV... but,3,"Overall my '05 Limited Endeavor has been a pretty good vehicle, but the initial quality issues I encountered have killed my opinion of the brand. I had the thing into the shop eight times in the first couple months.. since then I've had no issues. It drives awesome."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Mr. Mike, 09/22/2006,Love this SUV!,4,"My wife and I purchased this SUV several weeks ago. So far we really love it. It's quiet, fast, handles like a luxury car (that's a good thing), and has a great transmission. The sound system is very good and I love the display in the dash. I can't believe Mitsubishi is not selling these things as fast as they can build them. The dealership was willing to give us 1% over invoice and 0"" APR on the loan. It's incredible that such a great vehicle is discounted so much. My wife and I laughed all the way home. And we love that warranty!  Plus it got a great rating in Consumer Reports.  That's always a MUST!!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,RICK, 11/24/2006,Great Ride and Handling for an SUV,5,"I love the way it handles on curving roads.  It is a very soft ride, but no swaying.  It handles great and has tons of room for my wife's antique shopping.  The transmission is great, being able to shift yourself is nice, especially when going down mountain roads you can put it in 2nd gear and not ride the brake.  It does not have a top heavy feel.  Overall Mitsubishi did it right."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,gege, 09/26/2009,"After 3 years, still love it!",4,"This vehicle is Mitsubishi's best kept secret.  It handles with ease in all types of weather & road conditions.  We are quite comfortable traveling long distances, no back aches... no more leg pains!  We are tall people and having the leg & head room plus comfy seating is simply awesome!  I get exceptional gas mileage in town, averaging 19-24 and on the highway our best was 29 mpg!  Can't beat that for this sized vehicle.  The engine runs smooth, automatic shifts easily and steps right into passing gear when you need it!  "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,kc, 09/15/2006,Needs Paint...,3,"My wife was pregnant and we were looking for an SUV.  We must have gone everywhere and test driven every model made.  When we test drove the Endever I was shocked to find how quiet it is.  It was like driving the Acura or BMW.  The one bad point is that I have had the vehicle repainted twice because they refuse to paint the whole thing.  I found that the paint was bleaching in the sun.  My wife's sister also had to have hers repainted as well, because of the same problem!  The dealer is a pain to work with as well, so now I have a vehicle that paint does not match on.  I am trying to fix the problem."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,James, 01/06/2006,Awesome Vehicle...Great Buy,5,The 2006 Mitsubishi Endeavor runs great.  It stands out more than any other vehicle in it's class. It's an instant eye catcher.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Dano, 10/31/2010,Great SUV,4,"Performance has been great,comfort is very good, I have a very long torso and dont fit well in many cars and SUVs including Pathfinder. Could be a 9 or 10 with an adjustable up & Down Seat Fuel Economy could be better in light of premium only fuel. Great SUV drives like a car! The design is good the materials not as good (plastic interior) Exterior build great would be better than 5 if interior was better. Reliability has been great so far. Caution on the trans see below do the maintenance. I had been told to watch for trans issues. Probably would be eliminated with a bigger trans. EXT Design AWESOME A.W.D. and stability control Awesome 1st winter was very icy handled very well."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,ATee, 08/01/2017,Best Car I have ever owned,5,"First off,  this is an SUV that was ahead of its time.  Instead of a truck like feel - Jeeps, Explorers, Tahoe etc, this nimble SUV drives like a car.  Peppy, great acceleration, and the 6 cylinder engine gave much better gas mileage than the other larger SUV's.  AWD system is flawless, just be sure as with all AWD vehicles to get all 4 replacement tires at the same time.  I bought the car in 2006, ex wife put the first 90k milers on it.  The only maintenance we had were brakes and the Tire Pressure Monitoring System.  I still have the car, with 234,000 miles on it.  Mechanically it is sound.  Cosmetically there are a couple minor issues due to the long life of the vehicle.  Honestly this vehicle has been darn near bullet proof.
"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Kimberly, 05/10/2006,Terrible Idea,1,"I've owned my Mitsubishi Endeavor for approximately five months now.  It requires premium gas which I am not happy about and wasn't informed of when I purchased the vehicle. Already my air conditioner drain has clogged, flooded the front passenger floorboard, and because of a design flaw, the whole motor has to be taken out to get to the air conditioner. The dealership and the corporate office told me this is not covered under warranty. It is going to cost approximately $1,000 to correct a ""design"" flaw. Also, the paint is terrible and I have chips from touchless carwashes. I absolutely hate this vehicle. I wish I would have purchased an American made vehicle. Mitsubishi is not a customer oriented company!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Doug Kampa, 12/23/2005,"""Rishi""",4,"I really shopped for a new SUV; it was down to a Honda, Jeep and the Mitsubishi Endeavor.  I selected the Endeavor for its power, styling and ""feel"".  It is a very fun SUV to drive compared to the other canidates.  I am very satisfied with the Endeanvor, however it requires high preformance gas which I did not know until after reading the owners manual. I use my Endeavor as a real estate broker and my clients all seem to enjoy riding in it.  I think the quality of the sound system needs to be upgraded and some of the electronics seem to be style dated. The exterior styling is ""hot,""  the exceleration is excellent and the ride is very good. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Kwame, 05/05/2006,Impressive,4,"I am impressed with the performance, styling, and build of the new 2006 Endeavor.  I was happy to consider another Mitsubishi after five years with a Montero and I was looking for better gas mileage, the Endeavor hits the 'sweet spot' - it's a great car/SUV, lots of fun to drive, extremely comfortable steady on the road, and has effortless acceleration.  I highly recommend this vehicle to any mid-size SUV buyers and to anyone looking for great value for money - I know I'll enjoy this vehicle for years to come."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Rose, 09/29/2009,"Love, love, LOVE IT!!",5,"I owned a Land Rover previous to this, and had to call AMA about 7 times in the winter and it had problems every 2 to 3 weeks. I needed a more reliable vehicle, and was ecstatic when I found a 3 year lease return 2006 Endeavor (so, only 1 previous owner!). I've had it for almost a year and it drives incredibly, and I've had NO problems with it so far. Everything works perfect, plus it is a beautiful, spacious, comfy ride. I couldn't be more thrilled with this vehicle! Even if something did go wrong, I'm still covered under the 100,000 km warranty. No worries! "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Yonsson, 02/27/2010,"Great SUV, Slaughters Toyota",4,"The car has performed flawlessly since the get go and everyone I talk to says it'll go 200K easy. Those only problem I here of is a clogged A/C drain that backs up into the cab and its a $1,200 fix. A simple coat hanger or air gun up into the drain would do the trick people. Easiest car to maintain and cheap to fix."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Jerome Mincey, 08/23/2015,One and only owner 158880 miles and going,5,"The room and comfort of my Endeavor from me driving it from when it had 4 miles to 158880 miles. First from Augusta GA, to Lexington SC to Germany on the Autobon to Killeen, Texas driving back and forth yearly thru Louisana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. I am a very happy person because I know me and my wife  put those miles on the car. I am the only owner and still riding strong. Thanks Mitsubishi

I love that it has plenty of room, a commanding view of the road, and rides like a car. The engine has a lot of pep. The design of the exterior and interior with the blue dash lights give it a unique look. Now, all my friends want to ride in my car when we go places. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,go mitsu!, 01/15/2008,Nice ride,4,My wife and I purchased this vehicle used after looking at other new and used SUVs of this size.  We love it!  The ride and space inside is great especially for 2 kids.  Not one thing has gone wrong with it since ownership.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Rob, 03/27/2006,2006 Endeavor Limited review,4,"My Endeavor handles great and its ride is very comfortable. I love the audio system with the volume adjusters on the back of the steering wheel. Seats fold up very easily, with one hand. It has an excellent ride and is lots of fun to drive."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Brian, 02/03/2007,Great SUV,5,With a new baby on the way we needed to sell our Eclipse and get something with 4-doors. The Endeavor was perfect. It rides and drives like a sedan with the space and comfort of an SUV. It does not feel top-heavy like many AWD and 4WD vehicles do.  It gets better gas mileage for me than what was stated on the sticker.  It's perfect for someone who doesn't like the maneuverability of large SUVs but needs/wants more space than a sedan.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Happy in Chicago, 03/09/2007,Get One!,4,"We bought ours used (18,000 miles) and we are thrilled with the vehicle.  The 5yr/60,000 warranty means we still had more warranty on our ""used"" SUV than we would have had buying new for any other SUV.  The Endeavor has a ton of space and handles the snow extremely well.  "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Yash, 04/17/2007,Great SUV,4,"I am a true Mitsubishi owner. This is my second Mitsubishi SUV. I had a Montero Sport LIMITED and traded it for the Endeavor and could not be happier. The Endeavor is by far more of a smoother drive than the Montero, special when tracking pot holes. Very impressed with its acceleration and pickup. Also, you have the opportunity to adventure yourself with the Sport Mode by changing gears with its Standard alternative. Just a great buy and a pleasure to own."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Nelson Garcia, 10/21/2007,Mitsubishi,4,This car is very comfortable and also has a powerful engine.  Also is very reliable and it has a lots of space.
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,geneo, 11/14/2009,So far really good,4,"Bought our endeavor used last spring and it has turned out to be a really nice SUV for us. Haven't run it in the snow yet but it has a nice ride, good performance, decent mileage, and is overall a good car. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,JHENN, 06/21/2010,Good Vehicle for the Price,4,"I purchased this vehicle used from a dealership 3 months ago, and so far it has lived up to my expectations.  It has plenty of power for mixed city/highway driving.  The interior is very comfortable.  The center information display is a nice feature, but sometimes I get weird readings.  If the AC is on it will say the outside temperature is 35F when it is really about 80F.  Also, sometimes the fuel economy gauge will lock up and say I am getting 65 MPG for an entire trip. (If only it were true.)  My average gas mileage is  actually 23 MPG.  I bought my Endeavor for $5000 less than a comparable Honda Pilot or Nissan Pathfinder, and I think it was a good deal."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,lastman3, 07/25/2006,Best Secret,4,"My Endeavor gets 17 mpg around town and 22 on the higway.  Its V6 engine pulls the Sierras with no problems at all. It is a solid vehicle and it is dependable. It has had very few reported call backs. With the seats folding flat, it does everything I need it to do and more. My wife now wants a second one for herself - I can't think of another car or SUV that can do what the Endeavor does for the same price/performance."

mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Shadowtrax, 01/08/2008,Nice Comfortable Car-Like SUV,4,"A great vehicle that's much more nimble than its size appears - rides well on smooth streets as well as rough ones. Very good visibility and large front windshield is great - a person doesn't feel 'boxed' in. Nice dash and lighting. Good sound/stereo. Get's same mpg in town as similar AWD SUVs (15mpg) if you're light on the gas and stops/starts. Feels very roomy in front AND back seat. Has separate liftgate window (most other SUVs don't offer this). Huge sunroof is nice - allows better head room and feeling of openess. Comfortable leather seats. We live in a snowy area, and the AWD does GREAT in the snow - used it many times for ski trips! And of course, the 5yr/60K bumper-to-bumper warranty"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Sandy, 11/03/2005,Fantastic Crossover SUV,4,Our Mitsubishi Endeavor is everything we expected it to be.  The gas mileage has been consistent at about 19 mpg for combined city and highway.  We did take a trip through the mountains and got almost 23 mpg.  The seats are very supportive.  The stereo is fabulous.  The ride is very firm but soft at the same time.  The handling is excellent for this type of vehicle.  Had it almost two months now and there are no noises.  The car is put together very nicelt!
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,ERICS, 01/21/2006,Mitsubishi Endeavor,4,"My 2006 Mitsubishi Endeavor is better than I had expected.  It has excellent handiling and a nice ride.

It is extremely easy to move the seats front and back, and has it has the power needed when traveling throughout the state of Arizona with its varied terrain and altitudes. It is the first vehicle that has had all the features of a SUV with the ride and handling of a passenger car. I would recommend it to anyone shopping for a mid-size SUV.  "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,harry stewart, 11/26/2005,Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned,5,"I love my 2006 Mitsubishi Endeavor. I have owned Lincolns, Cadallacs, and lots of other cars in the past, but this is the best driving vehicle I have ever owned. I have 56,000 miles on it and have never rotated or balanced the tires, and it still hits the road like a dream. The only time its has been in the shop is for oil changes."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2006,Dale, 02/02/2007,2006 Endeavor LS AWD,4,"This is my first SUV, and so far, I am very happy with it. The ride is ultra smooth, it handles well in snow (I'm in Denver), and has a ""sleek"" look to it. Also, the gas mileage is decent as I'm averaging 19/24 mpg. The only thing I wish was different was it had somewhat more horsepower (it has 225), as its acceleration is somewhat slow.  Then again, with high gas prices, I would rather opt for the better gas mileage. All in all, the Endeavor is a solid buy."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,, 07/06/2012,"Not bad, but quite a few issues",3,"Pros:
Comfy on long distances, good power & acceleration, good storage, nice looking car and great for a family.
Both front seats have hard-plastic backs, so they're durable if you have kids who constantly put their feet on them.

Cons:
Liftgate is unnecessarily heavy, jack is hard to get to if you have a car seat.

Mechanical issues explained below:

Bought new, issues began with the A/C compressor (replaced under warranty).
Replaced the battery twice (also warranty) & continue to have issues with a short circuit on the driver's side brakelight.
 Engine requires premium fuel but still knocks & pings at times."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Brandon H, 02/15/2016,OK SUV with major design flaws,3,"Pros: It's AWD and handles pretty well. It have great acceleration for a V6. It's roomy for a midsize SUV. Has about a 400 mile range before needing more gas.
Cons: A/C is poorly designed. Water will eventually leak onto driver side floor. This can destroy the wiring underneath which will total the car. Luckily I fixed the leak before the wiring was destroyed, but it cost me $1000 to repair. Mitsubishi should had made this a recall. I've heard  the same issue happening in other Mitsubishi models. The hydraulic arms on the lift gate eventually go bad and won't lift the gate. The engine is an interference engine and uses a timing belt. The cost to replace a belt is over $600. If you do not change the belt, you put your engine at risk of being catastrophically damaged.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Lee, 11/26/2016,This car will ruin your life!!!!,1,"I purchased this car new in 07, and for the six years I was making payments on it there were few problems. At age six it began to methodically fall apart. The engine has had few issues, but the window systems will break and fail within 6-7 years after purchase, especially the rear windows. If you have a sun roof, DO NOT USE IT or you’ll be sorry like me, it will break in the open position and it will cost 2K to fix. I suspect I have no trade in value with this car, just in the past 6 months, this year alone I’ve spent 4K on this car just trying to keep the water from coming up through the driver’s side floor. Yeah, you see, Mitsubishi put their A/C evap tank in so that the entire dash has to be taken apart and removed to get to it. Mitsubishi did send out an advisory but not a recall. I suspect Mitsubishi’s reasoning for that is that there were not enough people complaining of this to justify a class action law suit so their position is [non-permissible content removed] You. Another thing I’ve been noticing is that you don’t see any Endeavors as old as mine on the road any more <g> I wonder why…</g>

Top notch reliability, comfort and build quality."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,Great Value,4,"Bought our 07 Endeavor with 15K miles on it for a terrific price.  Have put 10K on it so far.  Great car.  Black exterior and black leather interior look awesome.  AWD drives great. Only problem is that I recently found out from a Mitsu mechanic that it had been in an accident that was not on the Carfax.  Which is why my engine rattles a little bit louder than normal.  Nothing wrong with the engine, he said.  Just something I have to live with since there are non- original parts in there.  So, aside from a loud engine when idling.  I love it.  Also, battery died at 20K miles, but it was a quick fix."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Robert, 05/18/2007,Almost Perfect,4,"I tried a bunch of SUVs and did my homework before buying my Endeavor SE two months ago. I made the right choice. I just couldn't find a better deal for the money. It's got great looks, ride, terrific stereo, room for everything, torque and performance not to mention a great warranty. I got just about every option available, I plan to keep it a long time. Navigation system could be better by mentioning street names like the Gremlin, and not talking so much. I got a 2005 DVD navigation disc instead of a 2007 or 2008 version? Going to have to call. Folding the back seats I had enough room for several 6 foot long picnic tables inside and I could close the hatch. My girlfriend loves it. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,jameo, 04/15/2008,No Regrets Whatsoever- Smooth,4,"I bought this vehicle after painstaking research and test drives of so many others similar in this class. I have to say that have no regrets with my decision for many reasons. I had used this forum as the basis for my final decision and most of the other reviewers and I are in agreement. Overall one of the best deals out there. I live in a snow region and my first driving experience was during a blizzard. While other SUVs and 4WD vehicles where busy with low speed flashers, I cruised along effortlessly among the pack. Smooth ride, lots of midrange power, very roomy, and excellent driver response. Did I mention my insurance rates dropped lower than another vehicle I own, a 1997 Passport?"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,gameface, 12/28/2006,Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned,5,"The Mitsubishi Outlander is fun, fast, roomy, and affordable! I've owned numerous cars and SUVs. The Endeavor is the best riding and most ergonomic vehicle I have ever owned."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Great Deal, 06/06/2008,Great Deal,4,"Traded in a Buick SUV that did not make it past 85K miles.  Test drove the Honda Pilot and Outlander prior to buying my Endeavor.  The Endeavor outperformed the Pilot, had much smoother ride and comfort.  The Outlander was in the running but was just a bit to small.  After rebates got the Endeavor for the same price as the Outlander.  This SUV rides like a car!  Very stable and lots of room. Averaging 18.5 MPG with 50% city, 50% highway with 6k on the engine.  Hoping it gets a little better.   I only used premium gas for the first fill up (from the dealer). Runs fine on regular. "

I went by accident by the Mitsubishi lot because I was driving around the auto mall and saw the Endeavor and there was only two left, I drove it and was like WOW this drives just like a car I do go on occasional trips and its great. It has every thing I could ask for great sound great ride . beautiful interior and decent gas mileage for the size. I would recommend this car to anyone , and if i ever get another car it will be a Mitsubishi for sure."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,horsen1, 10/11/2010,Good mid size SUV,3,"Really like the exterior of the vehicle. Comfortable seats (have leather), love the heated leather seats in the winter. Fun to drive, outperformed the Pilot. Like the folding seats, prefer to the Escape where you have to remove the headrest. Fits two large dogs comfortably in the back (the main attraction for me as the dogs go everywhere). Love satellite radio. Wish that the wiper blades were quicker to respond to increase speed changes (live in the rainy Northwest, would love to have auto-adjusting wipers). Bought the ipod adapter - hate it!! It takes control from your ipod and is impossible to find your music once it's hooked up. Would rather have mp3 input jack."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Edward, 04/28/2008,Very nice,4,We have had the Endeavor for 1 year and is very pleased. We use REGULAR GAS in it without any ill effects. Averages 19-20 MPG... which is  better than My Honda Pilot EX. Build quality is not yet up to Honda standards.

I had a 2004 Tahoe z71 and traded it because I wanted better gas mileage and a better warranty.  This vehicle is so nice to drive, feels stable, great gas mileage, my kids and all their gear fits comfortably in this car.  And it can tow our four wheelers without a problem.  The sound system is awesome with the subwoofer.  By far better than the others for the price. We got the dvd system and the kids love it when we are on road trips.  Great investment.  "

Did I mention it is fun to drive, especially with the auto stick shift!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,devvon, 02/26/2008,Expensive to Own,2,"1- It needs PREMIUM gas or it runs very poorly (weak, and low MPG) 2- Engine has good power, but only with PREMIUM fuel 3- PREMIUM fuel is very expensive. 4- Cheap, tacky plastic fittings in the interior 5- Good interior room.  Comfortable seats 6- Exterior styling is hard to get used to. I bought this SUV and now I regret it.  Before you buy an Endeavor, be sure you know that PREMIUM fuel is required.  It gets VERY expensive to operate this, along with the poor gas milage (15 city, 20-21 hwy, that's with the expensive Premium gas)  I know other people like this SUV, but I can't afford PREMIUM gas all the time."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Erica, 05/04/2010,Not a comfortable CAR,2,"Well, My husband traded my honda accord in for an Endeavor.  They told me at the dealership that they will transfer my Sirius Radio into my new endeavor.  They installed it only to find out that All I can hear it Static.  Apparently they dont make a part that goes into the back of the radio to stop the interference with the radio.  So I was pretty mad about that! Then I kept hearing the radio changing volumes, Like it was go in and out? It would drive me crazy.   Next, I cant even keep a bottle of water in the cup holder without it flying all over the place.  It's uncomfortable to drive.  I just don't like it.  I'm sorry for all you endeavor lovers out there. "

Hated to get rid of it so I thought another Mitsubishi would be a good purchase.  Gas mileage has been 18 mpg consistently, less than what I got in my MS (which was 19-20 mpg).  It it a bigger SUV.  Seats are comfortable and great room inside.  I have used the back for moving large items and have taken several trips with dog crates so if you need cargo storage, this vehicle can handle the load.  Because I loved my Montero Sport so much, I do compare the two vehicles."

I love it, it is roomy, yet not to large.  There is enough room in the back for the kids and there uncle.  and they are comfortable.  The kids don't complain that there is no room.  There is also great leg room in the back for taller people.  My brother is 6ft and he fits back there just fine.  Never have a complaint."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Justin, 02/23/2009,Fantastic SUV,4,"We bought our Endeavor after owning a 2004 Lancer Ralliart to have more room and cargo space.  We absolutely love it.  It's comfortable, rides great, and has plenty of power.  We have also only run 87 octane and have not had any problems or noticeable loss in gas mileage."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Keith in Texas, 02/05/2008,Smart Purchase,5,The vehicle handles like a car.  Needed a vehicle big enough to ride a family with two big kids.  The kids first comment was wow they love the leg room. Everyone sits good.  Not clunky like other SUVs I owned.

The car ran perfectly, was SO much fun to drive and it looked and felt brand new even after a year of driving. In a snow storm, I was moving 15 mph and a simply tapped on my brakes slightly, the brakes locked instantly, caused me to slide across the divider into oncoming traffic. There was NO reason the brakes should have locked.  The insurance adjustor agreed with me.  The body structure allowed for my survival but it wouldn't have happened in the first place if my brakes didn't lock. Don't go for looks alone and be careful if you purchase it!   "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Brooks, 02/12/2007,Best Overall,5,"I have test driven all of the competition and found that the Endeavor is unparalleled in comfort and ergonomics.  If you are searching for an SUV that is an all around great bargain, search no further.  I still can't believe all the standard features and 10yr/100k warranty at this price! It is definitely worth your time to test drive one."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,EHAZE, 03/20/2007,Great Value,4,I am comparing this vehicle directly to my 2006 Honda Pilot EX. The Endeavor SE with Navigation is very easy to drive.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,TAG, 08/27/2007,Excellent Value,4,My wife and I have driven ours over 3000 trouble free mostly highway miles. We're more pleased with our purchase now then when we rolled it off the dealer's lot. This is a very good highway vehicle. One of my biggest concerns about a vehicle of this type was how well it would handle cross-winds and truck wash. Well it is no longer a concern. It's the most stable vehicle I've owned in those conditions. This SUV should not be the well kept secret that it is. The Endeavor is a must drive for those in the market for a mid-size crossover that don't require a third seat. 
mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Doc, 11/14/2007,Doc's Review,5,I traded a Lexus for this vehicle and it is one of the smoothest riding SUV that I have ever owned. Gas mileage is outstanding and it has so much leg room and head clearance that it is the perfect SUV that a person can and will ever drive.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2007,Clifford Foy, 09/13/2018,Unbelievable,5,"I bought my vehicle after having a very disappointing experience with a 1999 Isuzu Trooper I had.  Several persons told me not to buy the Endeavor and to invest my money in another vehicle. I bought it used with only 2500 miles. Today the car has 110,000 and I've never taken it to a repair shop. The only investment has been in a new air conditioning unit. The engine has worked great and flawlessly throughout all these years. It is the only vehicle I have and it is used continuously by myself, my wife and my daughter. Great for Mitsubishi for producing such a great car. Every time I read a negative report about Mitsubishi I laugh, mainly because it is a great car at a great price. It is one of the best kept secrets of the Japanese car industry. Keep up the good work.

Lots of storage pockets, and it has 4 cup holders up front."

mitsubishi,endeavor,2008,John, 03/07/2010,"Not bad, needs improvement",4,"I bought my suv with 11K miles. This lightweight SUV is good for what it is: ""A lightweight suv."" I previously had a honda pilot, that SUV was excellent in the snow, this Mitsubishi in the snow tends to slide a lot, even with the AWD option that I had. Towing capacity: 3500 lbs., not many boats you can tow with that. Interior is very cheaply designed, while the outside is not that much better. Premium gas requirement is a major minus especially in this economy. But you feed it it's premium gas and it performs very well. Steering is excellent, as the low engine makes this car practically stick to the ground, love that feature. An overall good suv if you don't have many expectations."
mitsubishi,endeavor,2008,TimmyD, 03/22/2008,New Mitsu for a GM loyalist,4,"As a loyal GM owner, I have to admit when I began began researching new cars to replace our GMC Yukon, Mitsubishi was not high on our list.  After a couple of weeks of searching we found that Mitsubishi had a generous factory rebate and decided to give the Endeavor a test drive.  We were impressed by the handling and lively engine performance.  We have two children and were concerned about interior room, since we were used to the spacious interior of our Yukon.  We were pleasantly surprised when we all piled in and realized that we had plenty of room and that the large cargo area had sufficient space for our large stroller and many other ""must haves"" for parents.  We took it home that day. "

On the highway I am getting an ave 25mpg and 18 to 20 in the city. I thought I was getting less than that, pleasant surprise. We still love everything about the Endeavor. Really hope that when I am ready for another vehicle next year, Mitsubishi will have come out with another SUV. I would gladly own 2 of these vehicles."

I got one in kaplana black, it has a great look and the exterior design is gorgeous. The interior blue lights are brilliant at night and the whole car has an understated elegance inside and out. I did not buy it for the cargo but I put subwoofers in the back and it fits great. The car can fit the look for anyone, mothers driving kids to school to just driving with your friends to a club."

I bought this 2008 Mitsubishi endeavor se in the beginning of my junior year of high school.  This car was great when I first got it.  But later in the first year it starting giving me problems.  It kept sering the mechanics frequently and running me costly to maintain it.  The first repair was the engine itself and secondly the shocks needed to be replaced a good number of times.  People might say here it ls because of driving habits perhaps.  But I beg to differ,  I don't drive crazy or too rough.  I don't take it off road for it even to need shocks often.  I'm not saying it's not bad,  it just that it'll run you costly later on.. But I think that's common for a older model car.  And it's not going to happen to every driver as well

The inside is very comfortable and quiet. The bright blue LED dash is awesome at night. The engine doesn't have a ton of HP, but the torque easily makes up for that. The engine hauls this suv around with ease, but with just so-so (17 avg) gas mileage. Overall, this suv does not disappoint at all."

The great reviews that the Outlander gets is wonderful however for a typical family where the emphasis is on comfort, convenience and ease of operation the Endeavor should be considered. The ride on the Endeavor is far superior with tight handling and great ride comfort. Interior room may on paper be similar, however again the Endeavor's layout is far more comfortable. The six speed transmision is smooth and has far greater low end tork. Love it!"

I love the drive, the comfort and its many features, including the Bluetooth, back-up camera and navigation system.  Prior to purchasing my 2010, I drove and priced the Pilot, Highlander and Veracruz.  The Endeavor was clearly the best value and the most fun to drive. My hope is that Mitsubishi continues to produce the Endeavor. I have had two friends purchase Endeavors after riding in mine.  A special vehicle. "

mitsubishi,endeavor,2010,dissatisfied13, 11/10/2011,NOT SATISFIED!,2,"I purchased a 2010 Mitsubishi Endeavour about 6 months ago.
About 1 month ago a loud wheezing noise started coming from the engine. The noise did not start till about a month ago and it only at speeds of 60mhp and above and only when the car has been running about 10 min.
I took it to Mitsubishi and the regional manager determinied it to be normal engine noise. I asked why the noise was not there for the first three months the all of a sudden started. He told me that is what his service engineeers told him.
I will NEVER purchase another Mistubishi car again as long as I live.
VERY disappointed in the service I have received from this problem!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2010,Hank, 11/04/2009,Navigation System for 2010,4,I am very disappointed in the Navigation System with the 2010 Endeavor which still has 2006 MAP DVD in a 2010 car. How can you call a car 2010 when you have 2006 parts in it? I phoned their head office in California asking when they will get an update but their reply was that they have not determined when the new map will be done. The dealer agreed to buy a new one once it gets in but no one can tell me when that will happen. You would need to decide whether to spend the extra money for 2006 Navigation System on your new 2010 Car.  Beside that 2010 Endeavor is a great car to drive.

Car has incredible ride, very nice rim and tire combination.  Truly feels like you are driving a 35k - 40k car.  Smooth transmission and love the looks of the exterior. Radio also is unreal. Only negative I can think of is the gas mileage. This SUV will drink some gas! Hope this one is as reliable as the 2004. Test drove Hyundai Tuscon, Nissan rogue, but endeavor was hands down winner.

Living in a snowy place, I like the AWD.
Also, I have two good size dogs, so I wanted a SUV that has a spacious cargo area; this car does.
The car has a lot of great feature (hands free blue tooth, heated leather seats, sunroof, rear vent control, comfortable seats, front windshield whippers clear a bigger area than most, and the blind spots aren't that bad).
Unfortunately, the GPS leaves a lot to be desired.
Even if you don't put in a category or city, it still greys out letters so you can't choose them, and there is no where to search for general stores, only shopping centers.
I still keep my Garmin in my car.
Lastly, this car has a poor turn radius."

I have driven many SUVs and Crossovers and the Endeavor is by far the best choice for anyone in the market for a new vehicle.
I absolutely love the quality, performance, and luxury combined in the Endeavor.
I got such a great deal on this vehicle that I can honestly say I have no buyers remorse whatsoever.
I am proud to drive this vehicle!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2011,raneesh, 07/10/2013,Value for money,4,"I purchased my Endeavor (2011 -LS, AWD) 5 months ago and so far its been a great journey with the car. This SUV drives more like a car, even though it has only 225 horses, you will be surprised with the acceleration
once floor the pedal. Always easy to merge to the freeways, good control even at high speeds. My wife loves the rear seat of this car, like someone mentioned in this review section - acres of space in the rear seat. The best thing is the price - I payed almost half the amount for a similar size year 2011 SUV. 

I get 16MPG on my regular office commute and about 21 on highways. Not too bad for an AWD 3.8L V6. "
mitsubishi,endeavor,2011,sharonboswell, 11/06/2010,"Oh my, best SUV ever!",4,"I bought the Endeavor yesterday in black with black leather.  I tested about 20 SUVs and this one just hit me!  It sits up high and rides really smooth. it looks almost like a Durango but a better drive.  It is so comfortable inside and I love the remote starter and the GPS system.  I got such a great deal on this 38K suv.  After the 4k cash back incentive, my trade in, 2k for paying cash, I had a price in mind ($29,500) and he gladly accepted it.  I was astonished!  This drives so smoothly around corners and has the best pick up.  In addition, it is just a beautiful SUV, the best!"
mitsubishi,endeavor,2011,Rosi G, 05/16/2019,I love this SUV,5,"I bought it because my Chevy SUV used up more fuel. The Mitsubishi is very roomy for moving. I was able to transport my three piece sectional in it. Patio set. Its drives like a car. Compared to my Chevy that drives heavy. My Bishi is fun to drive. I love the black interior. The controls are great. I dislike touch screens, my Charger has it and I prefer the older style. Ready to trade my Bishi in for a Challenger :( Im going to miss my Bishi. Two SUV’s are no longer needed.

mitsubishi,endeavor,2011,glenda5, 05/23/2014,Dissatisfied Owner,3,"Not worth the money I paid for it.
Have had it for 2.5 yrs now has a significant leak coming from the sunroof as well as passenger air bag light and emergency brake light on (they never go off.)
I so regret trading in my Subaru Legacy Outback Limited for a Mitsubishi.
I purchased my Subaru (preowned) paid 5,000.00 for it, had it for 5 yrs and never had any mechanical nor any other problems with it.
 Sometimes what you see isn't what you get and wanting a newer looking vehicle can lead to buyers remorse.
Should have stayed with Subaru. :( "

Retiring my Galant in late 2012.
 Mileage....
 273,000

THIS CAR WAS A BUY ! !!
 After driving so many miles, in so many different
weather conditions, with so many cargo runs
(Kayaks, Bikes, Skies, ) this car has NEVER
let me down. 
 How?

Great mechanic, keeping
 with the timing belt maintenance schedule,

changing the oil.
 So since she has been such a great car,
 I would say it is time to retire her even though
 she still starts EVERY time, no hesitation,
 no stalling.
If only we could all have someone
 or something so reliable.

mitsubishi,galant,2000,SarahG, 08/07/2009,On par with Toyota and Honda,4,"This vehicle has been in my family for approximately 10 years now, and has given us no major problems. Acceleration is better than adequate, handling is excellent, and fuel mileage is good. It was my mother's to start, and then when it turned 8 years old, she gave it to my brother, who has a tendency to break things. He hasn't broken this yet, which is amazing. Neither my mother nor my brother have taken care of it as they should. I can't even remember the last time its been in for an oil change. My brother only had to replace the shifter cable @ 130,000 miles, and the radiator @ 135,000. Other than that, only regular maintenance, or lack thereof. I will only go foreign."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,skally, 07/26/2013,Wasn't the best for me...,3,After buying this car I realized it was one of those cars the dealer patches up just to get off the lot. The instrument cluster had been swapped out which means the car likely had higher miles than stated. The transmission didn't shift into overdrive which I never did resolve. After a few weeks of driving it the upper rear shock mount broke. So I fixed those things and traded it in on something else.
mitsubishi,galant,2000,joesee, 02/13/2014,"Excellent Car, wish Mitsubishi hadn't cheapened the look",4,"I still have my 2000 Galant with close to 200,000 miles, always trouble free. The acceleration and ride for a 4 cylinder are great. The look still holds up, and is much better than later galant models. Unfortunately although the car is still awesome, the paint has lost it's luster and repainting doesn't make financial sense, otherwise I would keep on driving it. If Mitsubishi had maintained or upped their game on the details for later models, I would have considered getting another for my next car this year. "
mitsubishi,galant,2000,chrislex, 08/01/2015,Great Car,4,"I got this car from a person online so at first i really didnt know what to think. After driving it for a week or so i knew that this was the car for me. It has a good amount of power for a V4 and all the little things it does is great. It has 187,000 miles on it and i always know its going to start and get me to where im going. I will say that i have put a lot of money in to this car. I put a new timing belt, tirod, and sway bar links in it. There is also a lot more to be done to it. The flex pipe has a hole in it witch dropped my gas mileage and it is very common that this happens in this car. Take care of it and this car will run for ever.

I couldn't believe this car was still running so good. I kept the car for my father and today this car has 231,756. My father probably changed the oil 2-3 during his ownership and this car still runs great, no problems whatsoever. Mitsubishi did great with these, I really underestimated them."

I have had no repair problems. It was my first car, so I can't really compare, but I gotta agree it's fun to drive compared to some other cars I've driven like Subaru AWD and Dodge Sedans.  The Eclipse was as much fun to drive, though.  I agree it's a good car for females. I'm 5'4 1/2'' and this car is a perfect size for me.  I understand my 6'2'' husband has very little leg room, at least it has more than his Mirage.  And It must be not enough space for children in the back. "

I see one of these cars in every corner. They are very common. Exterior parts aren't glued too well. The interior parts are aren't either. Not lots of room in the back. I've seen lots of these cars with the exterior paint fading. To be honest I do not think this car is one of the safest out there. Besides all that, the transmission is great I've had no mechanical problems with it. Just the brakes. Ive painted it once already. This is like a Honda except it has cheap plastic parts."

I have to say, for the price I can't 
complain too much.  Quick acceleration 
for a 4 cylinder.  Brakes wore out 
pretty fast.  The car gives a little 
electric shock from time to time as the 
door is touched when exiting. Passenger 
door sometimes doesn't unlock.
Cruise Control malfunctioned, 
Dealership fixed it under warranty. 
During the daytime it is hard to 
determine if the AC is on, due to AC 
indicator light being colored neon 
green (someone was not thinking at all

It's been super reliable, I have not had any major repairs done to the car other than maintenance like brakes, fluids, etc. I would definitely buy another galant.

I still get 27-28 MPG and it starts as easily as it did in 2000.  The only maintenance I have done besides brakes, tires, oil, is timing belt at 85k and plugs & wires at about 100k.  I am starting to get some rust on wheel wells and around the bottom of the doors, but Ohio winters will do that to a car.  When this car finally does quit running, I will definitely consider another Galant, just wish they got a little better MPG."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Pete from NY, 09/25/2008,Fun to drive but has serious problems,3,"I bought this car brand new in Jan. 01.  It was great for the first 4-5 years.  Fun to drive, great pickup and sound system.  Traction control works great in the snow.  I did all required maintenance at the dealership.  First, the horn stopped working (sensor in the steering wheel had to be replaced in 04).  Then the hood started rusting from the inside out together with several seams in the engine compartment.  The hood was replaced by Mitsubishi but I had to pay for paining and installation ($400).  The struts had to be replaced at 105,000 miles together with wheel bearings and other parts of the front suspension (total cost with new tires $2,200).  The car is only worth $3,500."

never had one problem with this car

fluids and go.  After about 30,000 
miles the engine became nosier but 
still pleasant."

I don't know why, but don't care, I have had no other issues with the car.  I was going to trade it in, but my wife talked me out of it because it is such a low maintenance car.  I replaced the radiator because of a small leak, do my regular services after they are due and change the oil every 5-7000 miles.  The timing belt takes me about a half hour to replace and I have done it twice just as a preventative thing.  It is not the prettiest car due to a couple south Florida hurricanes and I will probably repaint it soon."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Brade, 12/10/2008,She Got the Job Done,4,"Well, I finally did it. I had a little fender mender with ole Bessie Lou, and she was totaled. But this was a fantastic car. I bought it new in '99 and it almost made it to ten years. I've always really liked the styling, especially for its class, and it proved to be very reliable too. Only routine maintenance (oil change, timing belt, brakes, tires, hoses) that never cost much. The only issues I had were build quality with the glove box (had to replace the latch) and the blinker switch that was weak plastic and finally snapped after 8 years (but it still worked). So if you see one of these on the cheap, hey, you could do a lot worse."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Irie, 06/10/2009,10 years and counting,4,"Purchased in 1999. Fun, comfortable car to drive. I needed quick acceleration because of commuting on the beltway. Am not giving this car up, will be passing this car down to my children."

The only consistent maintenance I have done is oil changes, replace tires and brakes when needed.  I recently replaced the alternator this past winter and did the timing belts at the recommended 75,000 miles. I am pushing to reach that 200,000 miles mark!!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Mary, 08/26/2009,EXCELLENT Vehicle,5,"My mom bought it in 2000, and gave it to me this year; has roughly 224,000 miles on it, never needed anything expensive done to it, just routine maintenance.  The tranny and engine still run just as strong as when my mom first bought it.  After getting this car, I will always buy a foreign made car, never American made again.  On the interstate it goes nice and smooth and I can't even hear the engine even though the car is turned on.  Excellent vehicle, I hope it runs for many more miles."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,davo225, 03/07/2010,Still going strong!,4,"Purchased with 16K miles, now at 135K and still going strong.  Mostly routine maintenance.  The radiator developed a small crack at 125K and was replaced and I had to have new rear struts a couple of years ago, but that's about it.  Fun to drive, very smooth transmission, quite peppy - even with the 4 cylinder transmission.  Still looks great.  Cons are minor: I have occasionally rode in the back seat on trips, and the back is not that comfortable for an adult.  The cup holders are awkwardly located.  This is on the small end of midsized cars (new Galants larger).  Gas mileage 22-28 - OK but not fantastic.  Overall, this has been a great vehicle."

No major mechanical problems.  Replaced brakes, tire, sway bar links at about 120,000 and then the radiator at 145,000.  Great in Iowa snow storms.  Unfortunately my model is black and the clear coat faded at about 100,000.  This is a common problem with black Mitsubishi's.  Other than that great car! Would recommend to anyone."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,GBC, 04/10/2010,Rated a Consumer Reports best buy.,3,"I purchased my 2000 Mitsubishi Galant in 2004 for $2400 (repossession). At the time it had 100,000 miles exact. Six years later I still have the car and the mileage is just over 243,000. The 2.4 Liter motor is bulletproof in my opinion and the transmission follows close suit. Aside from the necessary preventive maintenance I have had no major mechanical issues with the car. I call this one a good investment."

they are trying to unload the poor 
things off of dealer lots. This car 
was of poor build quality, has been 
recalled three times, and was returned 
to the dealer numerous times for 
various warranty problems. When I went 
to sell it, NOBODY WANTED IT!! The 
dealers offered 30% of original MSRP 
even though it was in excellent 
condition. No one would call on it in 
the paper, even though it was below 
wholesale NADA blue book. Don't buy a 
Mitsubishi! Spend more and buy the 
quality of a Honda or Toyota. In the 
end, you'll be happier."

So I bought the 2000 GalantES hoping 
for a similar experience. 2 recalls, 
very noisy ride, and a few other

Mitsubishi can do a much better job in

during breaking.  And I have affirmed 
this from other Galant owners (even GTZ 
owners).  When going over a bump, it 
feels as if the front axle just can't 
take it.
Too much torque coming from the V6.  
They didn't try to distribute the 
torque at all, simple switch of the 4 
cylinder to a 6 during construction and 
design...bad idea.  The car bolts 
forward if you're not careful.
Overall..a piece of crap and I regret 
buying it every single day.

My advice: Don't buy this car!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Spyboy, 10/17/2002,Most Undervalued Car,4,"I love my Galant LS.  The interior is 
phoenoemal, everyone loves the comfort,

great low end torque, with an amazingly 
smooth ride.  This car handles as well 
as the $50K+ European cars at a 
fraction of the price.   The sound 
system is equally amazing - what a 
great car for both trips and daily 
commutes.   If you are looking for a 
steal on a midsized luxury car this is 
it!   The low resale is due only to the 
fact that Mitsubishi runs such low 
financing on their new cars that people 
prefer to buy the new at the low rates 
rather than pick up a one or two year 
old.   The LS is hard to find but 
impossible to beat."

When it came time to buy a much newer car, I looked at the 2000 Galant and liked the way it looked. I also drove the Altima and the Mazda 626 and the Galant is by far the best. I feel Mitsubishi is trying to make a move against Honda and Toyota, so they built a car of much higher quality than the price class. If you are shopping in this class you have to drive it to believe it."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Sid, 03/01/2002,Can't Beat it for the Price,4,"Compared to the Honda Accord or Toyota Camary in performance, style, quality it it is neck to neck.  I think it is just a personal preference as to which one appeals to individual.  But when you talk price there is no comparison,  The Mitsubishi Galant is $2k to $2.5k less than the Accord or Camary.  If you trade frequently, you might consider an Accor or Camary.

car I have had since I purchased my
first new car in 1974. I had always
bought GM vehicles but after my last
experience with my Buick that was in the
shop 15 times the first year, engine and
trans rebuilt at 44,000 miles, seatbelt
that did not work and they told me to
drive carefully in case it did not
operate properly in an auto

minor problems and the dealership
rectified them immediately.LOVE MY
MITSI!!!!!!!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2000,golden, 02/03/2006,Great Car,4,"My 2000 Mitsubishi Galant is a great car.  I bought it after three years of going through different drivers and it was still an awesome car.  The only things I have replaced since on it are the brakes once, the battery once, and the tires.  The only problems that I have had are that it squeaks a little (which is probably just the belts getting old) and it needs a new alignment and this is a 6 year old car with almost 90,000 miles on it.  The exterior design is beautiful and very aerodynamic.  The interior is very comfortable.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2000,ES Galant, 05/18/2006,Galant ES,4,"I had my car for 134,000 miles when I sold it. It had no major problems except for the radiator thermostat that was replaced and other regular maintenance. I could have bought another new Galant but they lack the safety features that are available as standard equipment on other vehicles, like the side curtain airbags."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Jason in Laurel, 03/24/2004,GREAT CAR!,5,"I love this car! I bought the ES 4 cyl 
model with the leather, moonroof, 
and spoiler. Not only does it look 
great, but it is a great car! The only 
problem I've had is the timing belt. 
That was my fault. It's not a cheap fix, 
but it's the only problem on the car 
with 151,000 miles!"

mitsubishi,galant,2000,tjlarso3, 03/13/2003,"Wonderfull car, especially for the price",5,"I bought my Galant GTZ based on a 
review that Car and Driver had that 
year. I started looking at the base 
class and quickly moved up to the GTZ. 
It was a great value for what you get, 
leather, premium sound, back lit panel, 
etc. Since I've bought the car, it's 
been terrific. I have close to 53,000 
miles on it and have not had a major 
issue. It's been very reliable, a blast 
to drive, and it just plain looks 
great. 

In fact, I was so impressed, when I 
needed an SUV two years later, I bought 
a Mitsubishi Montero. 

Great car, I would highly recommend it 
to anyone. "

Still handles well and looks great. Would highly recommend.  I especially love the way it handles, and the engine is peppy enough to be a V6 even though it is only a 4-cyl. In fact, I bought this from a dealer and the sales guy was bummed because it was the car he was driving around... keep up the great cars! Looking to possibly upgrade to SUV but will certainly look at Mitsubishi - if it drives as great as this car, I will be happy!  "

Besides brake jobs, a new alternator, and tires, it was a great car.  I bought my second one last years, with 93,000 miles on it.  It now has about 115,000 miles.  I just replaced the brakes.  I would definitely consider buying one again. You could pick up a nice Galant for cheap and really rack some miles with no heavy maintence."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Joy, 05/15/2006,Hell On Wheels,1,"I've had this car for 3 1/2 years now.  At first the car was great.  I took good care of it. Then the trouble begin.  I had a major oil leak, had to replace the transmission, had to replace the timing belt, and the regulator on the driver door went out. This car is never ending trouble.  Never buy a Galant. The back seat is very cramped. The repairs are very expensive."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,FSUGrad, 08/15/2006,It was My First,4,"This was my first car. And for a first car it was a great experience. Despite its probelms, I had to change the radiator at 86,000 miles and had a minor leak, I have no complains. I have made several trips to my home (Miami, FL, a 500 mile trip) with no major issues. I had a little smoke once because of the oil leak. It has good pick-up after all these years. Plus it gets great fuel economy and is a good college student car to have. With regular maintenance, it drives just as well as the new Altimas, '06 Galants, and the Camry, all of which I have driven. "
mitsubishi,galant,2000,EFL, 12/03/2006,A lemon turned to lemonade,4,"I bought it new and had minor problems to start (the liner around the sunroof kept popping out). It is still not right to this day BUT, what a great car it turned out to be. I put over 207,000 miles on it with just regular maintenance and upkeep. But the one time I didn't do what I should have (change timing belt), wouldn't you know it, thats what blew. So now it's in the shop and I'm not expecting good news.  The engine is probably shot. But up to its last day it was driving great, getting 28-29 mpg and no issues. I got more than a few tire changes, brakes, normal wear and tear but overall I was very happy with it."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Deborahp, 03/27/2003,My first new car,4,"I love my mitsu.  Dont see a lot of 
GTZ's, in fact I had to purchase mine 
in a different state.  This was the 
most car for the money and of course 
the special financing of 0.9. I have to 
buy a new one now as I need to give 
this one to my daughter, but I can't 
find anything to compare with all this

the 5 are 10 years old or less. 

The ride is somewhat noisy - I made the 
mistake of driving this car after 
having driven the Camry.  

With those two caveats, this is a 
wonderful automobile.  After nearly 
three years of ownership, I have no 
other complaints - and I knew those two 
things (interior space and road noise) 
beforehand.

It is well constructed, solid, and 
attractive.  It has been money well 
spent, and has been as reliable as an 
anvil."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Britt, 07/18/2007,Fun car,4,"I have loved this car!!  I bought it a few years ago, and I have had minor problems.  The biggest one was probably that the coil went bad, but ever since then it has just been tightening of belts and routine maintance.  It takes a lot of abuse from me.  I have to admit I'm one of those aggressive drivers.  So I'm not the easiest on the car and it still does great.  It has a lot of get up and go when you need it.  I have put about 40,000 miles on it since I've had it and it runs great.  The A/C could be a little colder."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,summer, 07/13/2007,Runs Like A Top,4,"109,000 miles and this car runs like a top.  Other than oil changes and new tires (once), I've never had to do a thing to it, and I am not good about regular maintenance.  The exterior is showing some wear - passenger side door handles are loose, body side trim came off in the car wash.  If you are looking for a car that will start every single day and get you where you need to be all the time, this is the car.  The resale value is bad but works to your advantage as the buyer.  I'm looking for a newer one now.  I've never owned anything as reliable as this car.  Gas mileage is OK, accelerates quickly, ride is good.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2000,joecool69, 08/21/2007,Love it!!,5,"I have had mine for 4 years and it truly is a wonderful car.  I named him Jack because he's a jack-of-all-trades. Comfortable, I still get 24 mpg in city and 37-40 hwy, reliable and just a good car.  It's amazing.  Never any real problems.  I even was hit by a drunk driver going 57-60 mph and was not hurt except for a minor concussion and that was only because my car hit a tree in the back and I went forward. Had it completely restored and am still driving it now.  Amazing!"
mitsubishi,galant,2000,killertaco, 02/13/2003,Not bad for the money,3,"So far this car has been pretty good. 
We have had a couple of issues with 
the car including replacing the wing 
as it was loose when we purchased it; 
incidentally, I pointed this out to 
the dealer (Huntington Beach 
Mitsubishi), but they declined to fix 
it as they stated nothing was wrong 
with it, until I took it to another 
Mits dealer and they fixed it----go 
figure. 
Another issue is at low speeds there 
is a humming sound that comes from the 
front end, and this ""humming"" is 
really evident when turning sharply, 
but again at slow speeds. 
The driver side power window stopped 
working after a year, but the warranty 
paid for the repair.

mitsubishi,galant,2000,Gagan, 03/08/2002,Good sporty sedan,4,I like the styling and the steering of the car. It has given me no problems at all. The V6 engine provides this car a lot of spright.
mitsubishi,galant,2000,Nsdqmstr, 04/24/2003,Galiant Galant,3,"My other car is a Mitsubishi 3000GT - 
So the inherent ride quality of the 
Galant is a little cushy as I sometimes 
take corners as if I'm in the three 
thou.  There are many great things to 
list - Picking one, I'd say the styling 
vs. price ratio.  From certain angles 
(grill excluded) you'd think it was a 
BMW!  I like that."
mitsubishi,galant,2000,King George, 06/02/2003,KG's Galant,4,"Overall, I am happy with my Galant. The 
V6 is a sweet engine. Smooth with 
decent power. Too bad you can't get it 
with a manual. It's a good handler. 
I have realized that I should have 
bought the LS version since it would 
have been cheaper than going the 
aftermarket route for alloys and a 
decent stereo. This is my first 
Japanese car and I am impressed with 
its build quality and reliability. I 
have owned Volkswagens and American 
cars previously. Other than recalls, I 
have not had to take my Galant in for 
anything. It did have warped rotors and 
I have replaced them with Powerslot 
rotors and the brakes work fantastic. "

I've never had any problems and I love driving my Galant!  Great power, Excellent handling, and I love the way it looks.  Sure, Accord or Camry may be good too, but they are BORING and more expensive!!!  Why spend more money on those when you can get everything out of Galant!  I have never regretted buying my Galant and it's been 2 and half years since I bought it!"
mitsubishi,galant,2000,David, 03/05/2017,One of a Kind,5,"My sister bought this car in 2001. It was sold to me in 2004 for $900 (just had to pay tags that were not paid for ~ 2 years). It was given to me with ~ 40K miles. I still have this car and I  have had it now for ~13 years now. It was my first car in high school and till this day I still have it. It now has 196,858  miles and still running great. Major repairs I have done are the timing belt, fuel pump. I have also had to replace the starter and radiator. Besides that, just oil changes every 3K miles, break changes when needed, roter changes, O2 sensor change, back break leak. I plan on keeping this car until the wheels fall off. I have planned to take it on a few road trips coming up that will add a few thousand miles, but I am confident that this car will make it through. I hope it will last me till ~ 250K miles. Maybe it can be my child's car when I have one!

The V6 LS is such a smooth ride, I have only owned this car for about a month and I'm throughly impressed with it. I bought it at Arapahoe Hyundai for $4,000 and she only has 99,000 miles on her. She's a 2000 with that many miles?!? She was a deal! Her gas mileage is amazing especially for being my daily driver. Going to Colorado Springs and back to Aurora she hardly even had a tick mark down! This car definitely has potential to it. I'm so thankful that she has RIMS and not HUB CAPS. Overall AMAZING!

mitsubishi,galant,2001,Nish, 11/04/2008,Reliable Car,4,I have had the Galant for four years now and it has served as a reliable car.  The only complaint I have is that the fuel economy has gone from about  27 mph to 21 mpg over these years.  
mitsubishi,galant,2001,maddee2030, 09/17/2010,"Not too bad, but wouldn't recommend",3,"I bought this car brand new off the lot. I didn't have any problems for a very long time; just normal maint.  ~110K my transmission died w/ no previous indications there was a problem. Replaced a cracked radiator @ ~90K.  Never replaced windshield or headlights. 4 things I've always complained about. 1.The LCD display on the CD player is nearly impossible to read. 2.The fact that the CD player tells you when it's too hot is an extremely bad design flaw. 3. The top coat on door handles & side mirrors is gone. 4. Upholstery all the way up to the window? Terrible place to have fabric after 9 years of resting your arm there.

It handles very well (GTZ has sport suspension), and has a good amount of go when I want it. I have driven this car like I stole it from day one and it has taken most of the abuse. I have replaced the rear bearings once at about 90k, caused by cheesy caps on the inside of the rear hub rusting out. Blew up torque converter around 120k resulting in replacement boneyard trans (very, very rare issue, probably my fault). I have almost 180k on it now, getting some rust, need some bushings, O2 sensor, haven't replaced timing belt ever. Still starts and accelerates like the day I bought it every time.  "

mitsubishi,galant,2001,clee1138, 10/15/2004,"Decent enough car, poor resale value",3,"We bought this car during the '0-0-0' 
deals for when we were cash poor.  It 
has been a pretty decent car - fun to 
drive, comfy, and pretty reliable - 
but now that it's time to trade, we're 
taking it on the chin.  The V6 is 
peppy and responsive with OK economy.  
Handling is OK with the right tires.  
The interior is solid, but Mitsubishi 
cut too many corners - small console, 
no rear dome light makes the back seat 
DARK at night, and very limited 
storage space.  If you can find one 
used, it's probably not a bad choice, 
but let someone else take the new car 
depreciation hit."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,julie, 11/27/2009,Fabulous car,5,"My Galant is a great car, reliable, fun to drive, good on snow on ice, great sporty look; even 8 years later I get compliments. I have the V6 and the 3.0L engine and get at least 25 mpg commuting to work in the country. I will hate to see it go when the time comes.  Then V6 transitions smoothly and functions well on the highway when passing,even with the AC on. It has a great dashboard, easy to read; has room for adults to sit comfortably in the back seat. Great visibility to the right in front windshield, unlike other similar cars."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,tangesazen, 04/18/2003,Mediocre,2,"This car has ok looks, and I had 15
years of good experiences with previous
Mitsubishi vehicles.  I was looking for
a four-door car with good mileage and
good workmanship.  After twenty months,
I would rate this Galant as very
mediocre.  Mileage claimed was 33 Hwy,
27 City.  I get 25 avg with 90% Hwy miles.
Workmanship.  I've lost track of how
many things have fallen off this car or
no longer fit well.  And they must have
run out of money, the entire trunk looks
like it was made with the $15 left in
their budget.
There is a _LOT_ of cabin noise also.
My next car will not be a Mitsubishi."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,whale, 03/06/2002,Go ahead be different,4,"As said in the title of this review, don't be like your neighbors and everyone else and buy an Accord or Camry, get  the Galant. You will not fall asleep looking at it. It's less expensive, more fun to drive, and better looking.  It's amazing how many people look as you drive down the street.  I've had it for almost 2 months, bought new, the only problem is the front headlight gasket came loose on the right side, but it was quickly repaired under warranty."

It drove fine for a while. Then I realized, it gets 21 MPG on average. Really? For a 4 cylinder motor I expected much more. As for handling, it's alright. I've driven better and I've driven worse.

worked well in the winter (on ice).

Fuel economy is in the 23/24 in city

still average 25 to 26mpg with the A/C

mitsubishi,galant,2001,chinoloco93, 06/10/2002,Fun car.. air bag problems...,3,"I have owned my GTZ for a year and I 
have the SRS light on. It appears that 
the passenger side air bag is a known 
issue (at least that is what the 
dealership told me) and its a ongoing 
problem. So far however, its a fun car 
to drive. The engine on the GTZ really 
sucks because its the same as the ES 
V6. I mean, its got less HP than a V6 
accord and this car is screaming to 
have like 225HP. The 
suspension/handling on the GTZ is just 
super and very true. I can zip in and 
out of traffic with little problems and 
going up in the mountains, I feel very 
confident in the tight turning parts of 
I-80 into Reno."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,varand, 07/17/2010,So so,3,"I had that car for 21 month. When I bought it it got 176,000 miles and it was ok. It was good car at first year and I didn't spend that much as maintenance. But at second year it broke me down every thing was going wrong and I wasted too much money on it and finally i gave it to carmax . (don't buy any gallant with high mileage)."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,SiNTHETiC, 07/19/2002,"Fun to Drive, But...",3,"I have owned my GTZ for a year and half.
 Since date of purchase the car has
received one new side airbag, TWO new
rear speed sensors, a new battery, the
weather stripping over front head lights
has been replaced, and the 'Inifinity'
radio no longer ejects or accepts CDs. 
Additionally , I had to have the brake
rotors turned and the pads replaced
myself since the Dealership would NOT
warranty them!  The car is great to
drive, difficult to own."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,Chip Stewart, 07/30/2002,Great Car,4,"This car has done everything I've asked 
it to do and more.  I truly believe I 
could not have bought a better car for 
what I paid ($20,000).  It's fast, has 
incredible handling, and the brakes are 
unbelievably strong.  I conciously 
brake slowly, because cars behind me 
rarely can brake as quickly.  With 
9,900 miles on it, the only problems 
I've had were a bad key fob and an air 
bag that needed replacement.  Neither 
affected the reliability of the car, 
and were both replaced under warranty.  
This is my third Mitsubishi product, 
and I highly recommend their products."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,Shannon Stone, 08/02/2002,Interior Quality,2,"I purchased a new 2001 Galant in 2000.  
The vehicle runs great, but it is 
cheaply put together.  My map light 
falls from the roof, the side mirror 
adjusters fall off, the entire glove 
box lock fell out when I tried to lock 
it, and the vent on the passenger side 
fell into my dash.  It is not fun to 
pay for a car that you hate.  Also the 
side doors ding VERY easily if someone 
next to you kits your door in a parking 
lot."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,Kevin T, 09/12/2002,Fun Car,4,"We bought the LS brand new and we are 
not sorry we did.  Great car.  Growing

with a little more room. I would 
recommend a Galant."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,va3djl, 10/14/2002,Great Car,4,"I real nice car to drive.  Responds well
in the turns and has ample power to get
around your partners on the highway.  I
like the sexy look of the car inside and
out.  I have owned mine now for 9 months

 Absolutely no problems what so ever."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,GQqt, 05/30/2002,One Hot Car!!,5,"I am an 18 year old and have already 
owned 4 cars, and no, the others were 
not wrecked! My third car was a 1994 
Mitsubishi Galant ES, and I loved it! 
Great styling, ride (a biggie!), good 
gas mileage, and at 130K, no problems 
at all, just regular maintenance. I 
honestly think the Galant is under 
rated a lot! My Galants are the best 
cars I have ever owned, and many in my 
family. Galant is just as capable as an 
Accord or Camry with better styling, 
more standard options, and a better 
ride and performer. It would be nice, 
though, to have a little bit more rear 
seat leg room. Otherwise, this is a 
really HOT car!!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2001,miljam, 03/20/2002,great car!!,4,"i would recommend it's better  than a honda, great driving like on air..."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,Mike Smith, 02/26/2002,Galant offers pleasing alternative,4,I have had my Galant for a little over a year.  The car is absolutely beautiful and very fun to drive.  I have put about 17500 miles on it as of this writing and the vehicle has held up great.  The gas milage is good.  The front seating could be a little bigger and the road noise can be a bit loud at times.  Overall I'd recommend this car to anyone considering a Honda Accord or a Toyota Camry but doesn't want to pay extra money for a label.
mitsubishi,galant,2001,Rosy, 11/20/2002,my galant,5,"this is the best car i ever drove... it rides so smooth that some times i even forget im driving.... i love the design of it.. It was made to look sporty and drive like a luxury car.....smooth!!!

mitsubishi,galant,2001,Omais, 01/12/2003,i love it,4,"Overall, i think my gtz is real nice, 
the handling is great, the 7 speaker 
infiniti system sounds better than any 
factory sound system i heard, the 
exterior style is awsome. Engine is 
real quite, and styling is awsome. 5-
year 1.9 rate was the best deal around. 
I get so many compliments on this car, 
and the ladies love it.  A maxima or 
accord with all these features would 
cost way more, and doesnt look nearly 
as nice."

Mitsubishi 0%/0 down/0 payments 
campaign. I should have waited to get a 
Honda Accord. The car (4cyl)looks great 
and has good oomph when you step on the 
gas. Had to replace the tires at 35K 
mile and brake rotors needed repaired 
at 50K mile and now again at 54K.  
Materials used are cheap and has 
adequate fit and finish.  It's no 
Honda, but live and learn.  Depreciates 
faster than an Olympic sprinter. "

years.  I am happy on the power and 
handling of the car, even if the car is 
not a BMW.  I quickly wore out the 
stock tires at 33000 miles, I have had 
the brakes worked on four times.  I 
would not recommend going to the 
dealership for brake problems.  The car 
handles great in adverse weather, 
partially due to the Aquatred 3's and 
Dunlop Graspic snow tires."
mitsubishi,galant,2001,Dan Grandahl, 11/06/2003,The always underated mitsubishi,4,"Mitsubishi has been ahead of the 
styling department for 
years..innovative technology has been 
in their vehicles from the time I 
owned my first one in 1985.  I still 
have that car (a starion turbo) and it 
is going strong.  The 2001 galant has 
been mistaken by friends and strangers 
as a BMW and that suits me just fine.  
Excellent fuel economy and a big car 
ride. Abundant storage and a pass thru 
trunk that has come in very handy on 
ski trips.  I have owned 5 mitsubishis 
as well as various other vehicles 
since I began driving over 20 years 
ago and I seem to always return.  No 
problems and care-free driving."

mitsubishi,galant,2001,Larry72, 12/08/2003,Good value for l;ong term ownership,3,"I have driven this car about 28,000 
miles from new.  For a 4 Cylinder car 
it has very good pick-up and ability to 
maintain highway speeds.  The car's 
appearance in my opinion is better than 
the Camry or Accord but public 
perception (for trade-ins or private 
party seller) does not value a 
Mitusbishi as much as the others.

If you are buying the car for the long 
term, then by all means get one.  If 
you trade in every 2-3 years then you 
will not notice any trade-in value 
except for another Mitsubishi."

mitsubishi,galant,2001,pc2mac, 08/30/2005,Has Been a Pretty Good Car,4,"Just traded my Galant in after putting 86,000 miles on it. Still drove great. However, the resale values on Mitsubishi's are pretty bad so beware of buying a new one.  Never had any problems with this car with the exception of squeaky brakes that the dealer never was able to fix.  Pretty roomy for four people and it is comfortable and quiet for long trips. V6 200 horsepower engine is really nice. Nice looking exterior, the best of all the model years. Can't stand the look of the current Galants."

problems in 39,000 miles .The back 
seat is a little tight. The trunk is 
smaller then the Cammry but ok. The 
paint held up well. The car 
depreciated very quickly due in part 
to the 0% for 5 years and the glut of 
used Gallants being sold by rental car 
companies.        "

truck.  This was my first mistake.  
When I got in I noticed the tweeter on 
the driver door was missing from the 
Premium sound system.  It took 3 months 
to get fixed.  I then spent 2 months 
trying to get the airbag fixed.  After 
having the car for about 1.5 years the 
stereo went.  The dealer replaced it, 
but not long after the warrenty 
expiered, it would not read cd's 
again.  It cost me 300 to get a new 
stereo.  I have spent more time at the 
shop than I have on the road.  When I 
called Mitsu about the problems, they 
did not even seen to care.  I will not 
buy a Mitsu. ever agian.  "

great deal on it, as the Galants don't
hold their value the best. The 4
cylinder  makes decent power in the
midrange rpms. Rides very smooth and is
a quiet car compared to my old Saturn.
Good looks, handling, and doesn't feel
cheap or tinny like Nissan Altima and
Honda Civic. Labor costs for regular
maintenance are reasonable, although I'm
not one to ever visit the dealership. "

just mediocre.  Fuel efficiency is 
poor, I have never gotten 
better than 28mpg, even with 
conservative driving.  The lower price 
is attractive (as compared to a Honda 
or Toyota), but once you 
have owned it for a while you start 
noticing all the little corners that 
were cut to bring that price down.  
Not a bad car, but for $2K more you 
could get a Honda or Toyota and have a 
great car."

avoid when you park in a parking ramp

mitsubishi,galant,2001,Gratiful, 01/05/2018,can't give her up!!,5,"2001 galant LS V-6 automatic. Bought used 39,000 in 2001. Tinted the windows limo black asap. And always use a window shield in hot/cold weather. I've done regular maintenance (wear & tear) for 17yrs. Reliable, feel safe, dependable, great body design which will never look dated.  A lot of people thought she was an Mercedes, Audi, Infinity etc.  However, I had to replace the tranny at 170K. Got a used one 62K. Somewhat of a design flaw with the screen built inside. So, I recommend a fluid/flush every 25K which I didn't do. Always check. The leather interior is still perfect. No rips, tears, wear, etc. Inside is flawless. Only a small cracked line (2"") at the front of dash. Can't noticed it at all. The low profile alloy rims were included when I bought her, and they look great rolling down the street/highway. Clear coat started to fade about 5 or 6 yrs on top only. All I need is a paint job. Rest of car is great. Body is straight, no major accidents etc. However, the ride is noisy, but on a smooth road it's a great ride. Turning radius is too wide for a small car. It's light so cornering at high speeds is a no-no. My car now has 230k. I warm her up, and she has a little tap on cylinder 2 which goes away, and I put in a little engine treatment recommended by the Dealer. The engine leaks a little oil cuz of the miles but she keeps going. Gas mileage is ok but back in 2001 was a lot different. Especially if you live in California!!!!! Leonard at Dealership has been working on my car forever, and the guys said I should get about 300,000 on the motor. Couple people have always said to get rid of her. I've driven the car with low oil couple times cuz I need gaskets replaced. Still kepts running. I bought a Chrysler 300 but kept my Mitsubishi as my too go back by up car. Glad I did cuz the Chrysler had 3 recalls. So there you go..I've got my $ worth a thousand times over. Still driving in Calif and I'm going to replace the engine with a used 60k guaranteed 5k or 5yrs $980! Painted, replace fogged lenses, basically restore and a car cover cuz she is now parked. The value sucks but it's a timeless classic on her lines. And not a technical nightmare and reliable!!!!

The only problem I've ever had with the car is I had to replace one of the headlights. I can say with confidence that this car is just as reliable as any Honda or Toyota,as long as, you change the timing belt every 60,000 miles which is routine for all Mitsubishis.(This will run you around $600) Besides that this car had caused me NO inconveniences.

Japanese cars are the most reliable but this model has two major flaws. 1. the Galant's engine coolant system is made out of plastic, so after about 100,000 miles, it may melt and start to leak. Another is that brakes have to be changed often (about once a year). Over the last 7 years, no repairs needed! Parts are not that expensive. Other than that, enjoy Mitsubishi power"

The front end was unrecognizable. My daughter walked away without a scratch. This car can sustain major front and side impacts. We truly believe this car saved our daughter's life.

It had 100k miles on it.
It was the first car I bought with 100k miles.
My son has been traveling back and forth from college with this car and it's been a very reliable car NO PROBLEMS.
We have had the car now 4 years and it's hasn't cost a penny for maintenance other than normal oil changes and such."

So what if it's a BMW knock off, at least I paid half the cost.  Since I've owned it, driving has become fun again and I always feel safe driving it.  It may not have been your first choice...but it's #1 with me."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,Shizzleman, 03/10/2009,My best car yet!,4,I have had my Galant for 2yrs and I love it.  I have not had many problems.  The only problem I faced was when the heating coil got clogged and that cost about $600 to replace.  Other than that the mechanics say my car is flawless.  I do my regular oil changes and get maintenance and the car does the rest.
mitsubishi,galant,2002,Claren Megow, 07/10/2009,My 2002 Galant,4,"I love my Galant. I bought mine three years ago. I bought it used so there were some things that need to be replaced. It ran excellent the day I bought and continues to run great. I did have to take it to the shop to clean out the A/C filter. The heating coil is broken so there is no heat in the car, but where I lived that was not a major problem. I do want to get it replaced now that I have moved to a different state. But overall this is a great car."

I purchased a Black one, I did love it at first, then after about 3 years, the paint has started disappearing. Great big chunks of paint gone. I have had it looked at, and have been told, I i just look around at other black Mitsubishi vehicles, I would find that I am not the only one with this problem. Since then I look very closely at any Black Mitsubishi, and all of the older ones have the same problem with the paint that has just disappeared. I was told that the older models have that problem."

mitsubishi galant back in 2011 and it was by far the best car i've ever owned. We got ours from Vern Eide in Sioux Falls, SD and it had about 130,000 miles on it. The only we've had to replace in the last 3 years was a radiator hose about 6 months after buying and then just in the last 2 months had to replace the cv axle on the passenger side but that may had something to do with the way my husband drove it. Up until the accident i just had in the last week in which there wasn't nearly as much damage as there should've been, the car ran perfectly even during the -50 degree weather we had this last winter. It only
didn't start once! I will miss my car i certainly recommend it"
mitsubishi,galant,2002,TW, 08/15/2008,Most reliable car I've ever owned,4,"Yes I was one of ""those"" who bought this car brand new. Of course after two Fords and a Chevy, I'd wanted to give the foreign market a try. Honda and Toyota were too expensive and the Galant turned out to be a great commuter car. 146K miles later and I must say it's been the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned. No major work outside of schedule maintenance. Changed the oil every 5K. I'd rate this car just as high as any Honda or Toyota from the same year. Are there things that could be better? Yeah usually there are, but I'm very pleased with the Galant."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,Ralli_Rules, 01/17/2010,Pretty Decent Car,3,"I bought my galant in 2005 used with 56,000 miles. All in all it has been a pretty decent car, its not blazing fast but still pretty quick. I have left quite a few people at the line even with a stock engine. The outside looks nice, inside could use some improvement but its not terrible. Not too much interior space but thats not a huge issue. I have customized wit ralliart parts for more performance. Has been a pretty good car, I recommend this car as a great car for a first time driver."

Other than that a great, light, economical car.  My most recent check up they could not come up with anything that they could even forsee having an issue with in the next 6 months to a year, which is always nice."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,My first car!! rocks, 04/02/2006,"My First Car, It Rocks",4,"I bought this car like 2 weeks ago. I ahve not had any problems with it so far.  It has a sporty exterior but a so so interior. I agree with the fact that there is very little room for the backseat. Its acceleration is kinda poor.  I compared it with the Honda Accord that my friend has.  It is in the same class and everything. Perhaps I expect too much from my Galant. Overall it's a very good USED car. The value of this car went down like crazy regardless you buy it new or used. It comes with keyless entry, etc.  I love this car.  I am gonna hold on to it and I'll buy another Galant later on. Mitsubishi rocks!!! Of course, I wouldn't buy a new one."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,jmac, 02/27/2007,Good Car!,4,"I have had this car for almost a year now. I really like it so far! I haven't had any problems with it. My only complaint is that the back seat does not have very much leg room, as I am 6' 1"", so my passengers sometimes feel cramped in the back, especially if it's a long drive. I love the features mine has (see below). It has been a very reliable car so far and seems very safe. If you're looking for a Galant, I would definitely buy an LS or LTZ, the DS and ES just seem very cheaply made in comparison to my LS.  Just remember, you get what you pay for.  If you buy a cheap car, then you'll have some problems. I see a lot of people mad about their Galant purchase on here, but mine is great!"

I drive the crap out of it, and it never lets me down, now at 186k miles, im very pleased with the way it rides, and with the way it handles.

In the first two years alone, this vehicle was in for warrenty work at least 12 times. After having the car for 3 weeks they still never figured out what was wrong with it. While driving at highway speeds with the cruise on it would rev out as if someone slammed it into first gear. The dealer kept saying ""this car is so great and best rated car"" blah blah blah.

Superb handling for a FWD.
I've already avoided two serious accidents from idiots failing to yield to oncoming traffic.
I literally pulled some McGuyver moves on the road with this car.

However, the exterior and interior is plagued with cheap manufacturing and design.
This car is an absolute embarrassment to be top dog in the American Galant lineup.
Models overseas make this thing look like a POS.

The premium fuel gets extremely annoying and I wish I would have purchased a Hyundai or Ford Mustang for the same price.

My advise, get a used Chrysler Sebring v6 if you don't need to leg room"

I've had no issues at in in the last  six months and odometer reads 82,500. Having driven an Eclipse for the past decade (finally died at 172,000) I was comfortable with the brand.

Back room is really for kids and not for adults. It is fun to drive and it easily goes 90-100 mph on highways - stable and solid run. Great car for the money.

It has been hit 6 times and has always remained road worthy mechanically.  It has been 6 months after the most recent collision.

it has a quite nice system of car

really snowy time.  I have never seen a 
car easier to drive in the snow.  It 
has enough but not too many features, 
which is a plus for me.  Too many cars 
out are loaded with features that you 
never use but have to pay for.  We 
bought this used, so we did not loose 
the many off the lot value that 
everyone complains about."

I fell in love with the side profile and spoiler.  This is my second car (my first was a 1990 Mazda MX-6).  I would say most of these reviews are accurate.  This is an excellent used car to buy.  The only problem I've encountered required a new front oxygen sensor.  Otherwise it's mechanically sound.  Despite my inexperience with cars, I feel this car handles very well.  The acceleration is pretty decent too.  I can't wait to throw some moderately flashy 18"" rims on it to make it really stand out.  As far as the inside is concerned, yes the back seat is a little cramped, but its fine with me because I'm the driver..hehe."

tinted windows for free when we bought 
it from the dealer.  That helped the 
body style look more sporty.  Passenger 
front door sounds hollow when you close 
it.  Mitsubishi service dept said it 
can't be fixed.  Sounds like a cheap 
tin can.  Interior fabric is cheap.  
Car does handle well.  The back seat is 
very cramped- no leg room. Low 
horsepower compared to other cars in 
it's class.  We want to sell this car 
six months after we bought it, but it 
lost so much value that we can't.  We 
should have bought a Honda or Toyota 
because they hold their value."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,Pixie, 03/05/2002,Luxury for Less,4,"Excellent car for the price...with the optional premium leather, 8 way power seats, 210 watt Infinity 7-speaker system, you feel as though you are in a luxury car.  For the $22,000 I paid for this car, it is completely loaded.  My husband had a 1998 Honda Accord EX V-6 coupe and this Galant rivals it any day!  The ride is quiet and smooth and it handles turns well.  You can't beat the exterior design of the car either...a real head-turner!"
mitsubishi,galant,2002,jldude, 05/01/2007,A decent car,3,"This is a car that grows on you and the more you own it, the more attached you get. It's nothing spectacular in any area, but it's sufficient. The best thing about it is the quiet engine and smooth transaxle. It rides like a more luxurious car. I can squeeze 31 mpg on the highway so that's not so bad. Mine does feel a little cheaply made, that's probably the biggest turn off. The doors close like they're 10 years old and the shocks feel likewise, but it has a good loud factory cd player and despite the threatening rust in the engine bay from midwest use, it is still quiet and smooth and everything works. The brakes do squeal pretty bad though. If it had more modern technology it would be great."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,Galant owner, 07/08/2007,"Good, but not great",4,"I bought this car brand-new. I've never had accidents with it except one fender-bender where the side panel got bent (cosmetic damage only). Though I got a V6 for more power (gas wasn't as expensive back then), the car is very weak at low gears with SUV like fuel efficiency. But on the highways, the car is fun to drive and gets respectable efficiency (about 27-30 mpg). Hasn't given me any major problems yet, maybe due to the low mileage. Overall, this car is very solid, but is not very appealing. I bought it because of great financing options at the time. Probably wouldn't buy it if I had to do it all over again."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,ejmickens, 02/20/2003,What Resale Value???????,4,"I have no complaints about the actual 
car itself, except maybe the leg room 
in the front seat. My complaint is the 
way this car depreciates. I am 
currently about $8000 upside down. Who 
wants to try and buy a new car when 
you are facing those kinds of numbers. 
And as a former Honda owner this is 
the one thing that will make me go 
back to Honda. In addition I made the 
mistake of getting into a smart buy 
(aka: we tricked you - low car note 
now, pay out the rear later) so I will 
have to pay for wear and tear as well 
as mileage if I don't get out of the 
car soon."

Supreme gas requirement a total bummer...I refuse to abide by that one totally."
mitsubishi,galant,2002,vadim_st, 03/18/2002,Good transportation,3,"It is a mild, comfortable car for individual or small-family everyday transportation. The trunk takes a lot of luggage.

Small kids don't have a problem. It's fun to drive and good on gas. We have only had this '02' for 2 days but it seems like we got a great deal for our money. My husband is a mechanic and he looked it over good before buying it. We only payed $6800 and it looks new sounds great and runs well.

mitsubishi,galant,2003,richie6, 01/14/2014,Transmission Problem,3,"BEWARE OF MITSUBISHI GALANT TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS
(2003 for me) 

I learned the hard way from a excellent transmission shop about the flaw in my 3.0 V6 model with 4 speed automatic where these where a 'clip' deep inside the tranny breaks! This shop used to keep several extra trannys in the shop fully expecting to have customers come in for this very issue. He told me about it before he even opened it up and proved it to me!
These broken pieces, for one scenario, end up in the pump causing your tranny to fail and needs to be rebuilt. One main sympton is it will not go into any gear! Sometimes you hear the rattling as you run it. 
 
Get newer kit if you rebuild it!"

Good gas mileage, snappy for a 4cyl. After delivering Pizza's full time for several years and going on multiple trips to Yellowstone, it now has 235,000 on it. The only thing major was replacing the timing belt at just over 200,000. I will say also that it can get up the the 120mph that the speedometer says it'll go. (it just takes a while)"

Today Aug 2019 it has over 380k miles. Minor repairs like battery, starter a fuse here and there. It has never been wrecked and the paint is still great. I get so many compliments on a nice looking car and most can't believe it's as old as it is. The timing belt was not changed till around 250k plus miles only because it was showing some wear. It has never been to a repair shop for any work. My son graduated Nascar Institute and he's the only person to do any work on my car. Oil change every 3k miles. Best fuel economy car ever owned. Most miles are highway since i can put over a hundred a day at times.

It is 2019 and now I have close to 380k miles on this car. Its starting to burn some oil now but It’s still going strong.

I purchased the car with 42 mile one the odometer. Now it has 201,000 miles. My only complaint is the paint. Every time I see a Galant like mines, the paint is faded terribly. Also the Brakes seem to wear easier than most cars. The climate control needed to be replaced but luckily it was still under warranty. This car has taken a beating. It had been driven every day for about 110 mile a day. Never had a major problem. Engine and tranny has been solid. The one time the car didn't start was because it needed a battery. Mitsubishi has put together a solid car that can compete with all major car brands."

(Except battery=95,000 mi and starter=93,000 mi.) The GTZ is a great looking car with everything included. Great acceleration and handles great on highways. Drove this car to Lake Tahoe (HWY 80 and 5).Car had enough power to go uphill. Not good for city because of big radius U-turn. I normally get 22 around town and 27 on the freeway. Car uses premium gas. This car is comfortable, solid, reliable, fast and safe. Poor resale value, but it is good for buyer."

ft. from the windshield BUT I am COMPLETELY FINE and I have horrible back issues already. The air bags diploid and I was wearing my seatbelt correctly and I cannot even believe how safe that car type is. Nothing inside the car showed evidence of the crash (beside the windshield which got a spider fractures). When I got out the car I became frantic because I didn't realize before how bad it really was.
Safety ratings are important for cars and I'd say with much joy that this car choice saved my life."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Kelcie, 12/14/2016,Going to run this into the ground,5,"I bought my Mitsubishi Galant in 2013 with 70,000 miles on it. I just passed the 150,000 mile mark and wanted to just praise my Galant for making it this far. I have made one cross-country road trip in this baby, a trip to Death Valley and countless day trips. I've had a lot of mediocre cars and this used car has by far, given me the most bang for my buck. Since getting the car, I have had to replace my battery/starter, and my AC died on my cross country trip (replaced for $600 in the heat of August somewhere in Texas...eeks). I replaced the radiator on it, and replaced the brakes. I know this SOUNDS like a lot, but I consider this car to be the perfect vehicle for me. Prior to my move, I was driving around 80 miles a day on it. After the move, I'm still putting about 40 miles a day on my commute, and it just keeps hanging in there. This car has also weathered two bullet holes in my back panel from a random drive by in LA. I've never had any engine or transmission problems, which I consider to be the real risks of a used car. I plan on running this car into the ground, and believe with regular maintenance I can get to 200K easily, and 250K if I am really really nice to it. :)

mitsubishi,galant,2003,yuuuup, 10/22/2014,Love hate relationship,3,"bought it in 2008 with 39,000 mi., now has 160,000. A/C was clogged twice, heater door became stuck, and that's about it. I ride this bitch like a beast at an AVERAGE 80 mph on the freeway. The biggest issues are the maintenance issues that arise, such as the recurrence of misfires which can potentially damage your catalytic converter if not assessed ($900). This car is tough like a honda and can potentially be just as reliable at the cost of good maintenance. change the timing belt every 50-60 k miles. change the tran fluid every 40 k miles MAX! Make sure you put in luxury fluids, like amzoil, and mobil one. on my benefit, i bough it used with nearly new miles. used with high miles is iffy."

The cost of ownership is super low because the thing is so solid and reliable. Aside from a timing belt about 90K, I have had no mechanical issues at all. With 130K miles on it, it probably drives better than it did when I bought it.  I need some more room, so I am getting another car, but if Mitsubishi made a Galant wagon, I'd be on the hunt for one.

My V6 LS also looks great with 17"" wheels. If there is one thing I that hurts this car, is that they don't hold their values, so it's great for those who buy it used. Make sure to change the transmission oil every 24K miles and get the timing belt changed every 60K. You can get 180K miles out of these cars easily."

mitsubishi,galant,2003,Bergerman, 08/09/2006,"Like It, but Never Loved It",3,"The Galant is an overall good, solid, reliable car.  It was years ahead of its competition in exterior design.  As soon as the others caught up, they went and made it ugly again in '04. Its resale value stinks, I mean it's absolutely horrible, to the point that I cannot trade it in, so I just have to live with it, kinda like my wife.  She calls it the ""Grampa mobile"" because it handles like the '89 DeVille I drove in college."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,gsemike, 03/08/2003,It's Getting Long in the Tooth,3,"Maybe it was a sharp design in 98, but 
now it looks old and boring inside and 
out.  I've been looking for a 6 cyl 
sedan, and it only took a few minutes 
for me to know that the Galant wouldn't 
cut it.  How did it get up to $23,800 
and still have cloth seats?  I'm still 
shopping, but the Galant is definately 
behind the Chrysler Sebring and 
Mazda6.  The Chrysler and Mazda dealers 
were far more willing to deal and both 
cars are new designs and feel more 
solid.  Even though I asked twice, 
Wantaugh Mitsubishi never let me know 
what invoice was on the car."

mitsubishi,galant,2003,CNDN opinion, 06/01/2008,Canadian Opinion,4,"I bought the Gallant in 04 with just over 20,000 km on it,  it now has almost 180,000 km.  Not a problem or a let down yet,  just had to do some regular stuff to it.  Replacement parts are expensive and the gas mileage could be better but it's fun to drive.  The Galant is used as a highway commuter mostly,  and handles great in the wind and heavy snow.  The resale value is crap so if you buy one,  be ready to keep it until it's paid for."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Kay, 08/05/2008,Hate the gas mileage,3,"I bought this from a rental company. The car has basically been problem free except for the heater/air conditioner.  A co-worker who owns a 2002 model is  having the same problem.  I was also disappointed with the gas mileage.  Otherwise, the car has treated me well!"

mitsubishi,galant,2003,daddy-danny, 10/09/2008,decent 4th car,4,"Overall, I love my car. I hear these bad reviews on it here and there, but overall, the car has power. It is semi-comfortable, soft seats, easy to drive, nice body, and great responsiveness on the road. Gas isnt too good though, but it is sitting on 20 chrome rims which left the tire place to have to lift the car. I say I'm getting 16-18 mpg! Whatever you do, if you want to save gas, stay with stock. But it is a great car. Its a car that can be for both male and female, unlike the 2006 sentra! Guys, do not buy that, you will be considered a female! Another issue is how fast the resale price goes down on Kelly blue book! "
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Patrick, 11/01/2008,Galant ES. Great buy.. a few issues,4,"Bought this car for mom at the end of 03.  The car performed well for 4.5 years and required only routine maintenance.  Two problems came up at around 55,000 miles that I think you should know about.  Heater problem-  The heater began failing intermittently (vents would blow, but no hot air).  The problem was not the heater core, but rather a component (a valve or a switch) of the heating system.  I found that this was a common Galant issue and is not cheap to fix unless you diy.  The other problem was that the driver's power window began to fail intermittently around 57,000 miles."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Amit, 11/04/2008,Awesome Vehicle,5,"I have nothing but praises for this vehicle. It's built to last, has a powerful V6 engine and is a fun ride. I have had this vehicle for over 4 years now and used it for over 45K miles. The only other thing that I had to do besides the regular oil servicing was to change the brake rotors a couple of times (which is common to all vehicles, std life span being 2 yrs) .   "
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Kaisere, 12/26/2007,Love This Car,4,"I bought my Galant about 3 weeks ago. It had 32,000 miles, very low I thought for an 03. The interior and exterior were in great shape. I feel in love with this car as soon as I took it for a test drive. It was either between an 06 Malibu or the 03 Galant. The Galant drives so smoothly I'm glad I chose it. They style of the car is sporty yet ""mature"". My car already came with the spoilier so that's why it looks sporty. The interior looks like every other Galant, the greyish color seats. The car is very spacious, bigger then my neon. So far I dig this car and I hope it lasts me for a long time :) "
mitsubishi,galant,2003,xcore, 12/30/2007,I LOVE IT,4,"It's nice and easy to drive, comfortable seat, but it should install a handle for old people get in or get out the car. It has a 2.4L engine,it's quite powerful for a 4 cylinder car and it's very reliability. "
mitsubishi,galant,2003,HappyBum, 05/10/2009,Fine by me,3,"I bought my 03 new in February 04.  I can say it has been a good car.  I have 83K on it now.  I had to replace the battery (last week) the 02 sensor, and just replaced the brakes at 81000 miles.  Aside from that it has been fine.  I drive it mostly on the highway and get an average of 27 mpg.  For the money spent I have no complaints.  I like the soft ride and the car handles fine.  I have the 2.4 4 cyl, 6 would be better. However, it has get up and go enough for the commute to work everyday. Looks good, runs fine.  "

I basically know this car in and out now! All I can say is that it is an O.K. car. You can expect the least in this car as far as performance and handling, but at its age, it drives slick and smooth. The body seems weak, but the look of the body has an old school feel as far as classic cars like the regal and classic caprice. The last issue that I had to deal with owning this car was the jamming of the heater door (to where the car had no heat). Prior was the A/C leakage, and a common issue is interior noise, and the brakes are always squealing. Overall, the price is what you are paying for. "
mitsubishi,galant,2003,nd4spd, 01/21/2008,2003 Mitsubishi ES Galant,4,I bought 2003 Mitsu ES 4 door in 2004. It is almost 4 years and never had any single problem. It is fun to drive this car and it is picking up good when you press the gas pedal.

Drives grate, very smooth and reliable: It's a Japanese car! Most people just know Honda and Toyota but in fact these brands are not much better than other Japanese brands. I recommend this car to every one who wants to have a great car for the price. Exterior design is really beautiful and fantastic. The interior has everything you need. I love my Galant!"
mitsubishi,galant,2003,former owner, 12/02/2009,"Good car, but...",4,"I had this car from 2003 and just traded it in this past weekend.  Overall, it is a very reliable car.  I never had any major problems with it.  While driving it, I got rear-ended twice.  I also lost control of the vehicle once while attempting to avoid a driver on a cell phone and was hit on the passenger side.  I consistently walked away without a scratch and relatively minor property damage.  That being said, if you can afford it, I would go for a new car or one made in the last couple years.  While this is a good, reliable car for its age, the safety features which are standard cars today are SO much better than they were in 2003.  (Curtain airbags, stability control, etc.)."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,zc, 04/03/2010,03 galant,4,"bought the car at 60,000 and now have 140,000, no major problems yet. peppy for a 4 banger (with a cold air intake) and smoothest tranny i've ever felt. got brakes, tires and a tune up at 100,000 and with regular oil changes have had no problems. over all great car."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,bborrelli, 09/09/2010,"In most cases, a solid vehicle",4,"My dad and I bought a black 03 Mitsubishi Galant ES with the fun and sun package.  It currently has about 114,000 miles on it and honestly, I wish I could say it runs well. When we purchased it, we noticed the paint was degrading in areas on the roof, hood, and upper quarter-panels. We had it repainted at MAACO (Presidential service) for maybe around $299?  Well after that, I began noticing a ""bump"" while the car shifted from gear to gear.    Recently, I've been getting around 16 miles per gallon, city and highway driving.  I got the transmission fixed , but it seems the engine's shaky idle is affecting it.  I love this car so much, but I've spent too much money fixing it. :("

for the money that could be saved

others like the Camary and Accord.  The 
GTZ is a great looking car with 
everything included...V6, sunroof, 
leather, cd stereo, alloy wheels, power

If your looking for a car that has 
great performance and your not

It handles awsum and looks classy.  Its 
a smooth ride with great pickup.  The 
inside is a little bit prehistorc and 
uninspired though.  There's no style to 
the inside at all.  But after reading

mitsubishi,galant,2003,supervic, 12/30/2002,Smooth and Practical,4,"Before last weekend, I never thought 
that I would get a Mitsubishi car in my 
life.  The precise control is similar 
to and the ride is much smoother than 
my last car-'93 Nissan Altima.  I did 
some research and compared it to 
Accord, Camery, Altima & Torus that 
interest me.  In my opinion, Galant ES 
V6 is a practical family car with 
excellent performance and is the best 
bang for the buck.  Since not too many 
people desire Galant, there is much 
room to negotiate the price with the 
dealer. What impulsived me to get a 
Galant is because of its 0% Finance 
plan for 60 months."

Galant is still as perfect as the day I 
purchased it.  Fuel economy is much 
better than expected - I've seen 31 mpg 
which is several better than the EPA 
highway rating.  Engine is smooth and 
has plenty of power for passing. The  
transmission is fantastic, I never feel 
it shift.  All the controls are simple 
and logically laid out so they fall 
right to hand.  Reliability has been 
outstanding.  Never anything other than 
regular maintenance."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Greg02, 01/23/2003,ES V6 is Excellent,4,"I just love this car!  The V6 is smooth 
and powerful.  The seven speaker sound 
system sounds great.  The transmission 
works incredibly well with little 
hesitation.  The car looks great, too.  

The only thing that I dislike is that 
it does not have a 60/40 folding rear 
seat.

This car is definitely a great 
alternative to the boring Camry and the 
generic Accord.  I always enjoy being 
in the driver's seat of this car."

and am loving it so much. I have so 
much fun with the V6 engine. The car is 
on the go with just a tap on the gas 
pedal. It drives like a dream. The car 
is very quiet. The stereo sounds good. 
The seats are comfortable and spacious. 
Plus, I was treated very well in Carmax.
With the $2500 cash incentive, it is 
about $5000 less than a comparible 
Camry, and even more compared to 
Accord. It is the best you can get for 
the money."

drives the car and she loves it.  My 
only dissapointment is the sloppiness 
of the transimission.  When you need 
the car to downshift for passing the 
transmission takes forever to shift.  
The car has a good ride to it and 
isrelatively quiet at freeway speeds.  
The gas mileage sucks for a v6.  I 
normally get 22 around town and 25 on 
the freeway.  My 97 z28 camaro gets  
better gas mileage than this car.

Just don't be surprised when you are only getting 23 mpg on the highway, while your fellow Camry, Grand Prix, and Accord drivers are getting 28+.  I was sucked in by the 0% financing for 60 months so I caved in and bought it.  Now I'm trying to get a new car because my family just increased by 1 and the backseat in this thing is ridiculously small for a ""mid-size"" sedan.  It's laughable!

I like the exterior styling of the car, the front looks aggressive and the back looks a bit like the older BMW's. I have had this car for about 16 months now and have been very happy with it. Only a couple of compaints: 1) as mileage in the city stinks. 2) when I try accelerating aggressively it does this weird thing where it gets caught when the engine is revving at around 4,000 rpm. The Galant depreciates pretty quick for the quality of the car. I would rate it just behind the camry and the accord, but for the money you save, I would rather get this car. Great Buy!"

and this is s great car to drive. It's 
very smooth and responsive without 
loosing the feel of the road. The gear 
box adjusts to how you're driving the 
car. It'll let the car rev out more if 
you're having fun, and shift at a lower 
RPM under normal use. I have it 4 
months and still turn around to look at 
it after I park it. For the money it 
can't be beat, I still love it as much 
as the day I picked it up from the 
dealer"

basics when coming to a car. I seek 
most importantly Reliablity, Ride and 
Comfort, Safety, Power and Handling 
Dynamics. Of all the midsizers I 
tested when I was shopping for a car, 
I felt confident with the Galant. It 
is a very competent automobile, feels 
very European. In fact, of all the 
midsizers I tested, I got the Galant 
for myself and the Passat for my wife. 
Both cars are still great and I would 
reccomend it to anyone who is looking 
for what I am looking for."

The drive is really smooth, especially on winding roads. The gas mileage is decent. This car is way less expensive than Toyota Camry / Honda Accord models with comparable features."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,a galant driver, 03/18/2004,Its ups and downs,4,"Really, it's a nice, fun car to drive. 
Knowing that whenever you drive down a 
street, people are looking at your car 
wondering if it's a BMW is a nice 
feeling. However, before driving this 
car, I drove a 1993 Honda Accord. 
Another member of my family drives a 
1998 Accord. One thing I noticed is that 
on the Hondas (even on the 10 year old 
one), there are more features in the 
interior (pockets on the back of the 
front seats, glove compartment lock, 
easily accessed cupholders) than on the 
Galant. On my angled driveway, the 
parking brake tends to squeak and slip a 
little more often than my Accord 
previously did. "
mitsubishi,galant,2003,j.campbell, 05/22/2006,Excellent vehicle for the money,5,"For the money, the vehicle is better than a Honda or other comparable vehicles. I will gladly purchase another one in the near future. The one secret that the public is not aware of is its reliability. "

reach. It's so quiet while driving, you 
can actually enjoy the excellent sound

a rental when I got my car back, I went
out and bought this one. I have had 4

it. You can not beat this car. My second

mitsubishi,galant,2003,OldGuy53, 11/02/2004,Most Bang for the Bucks,4,"The Galant handles more like a sports sedan.
We have an Altima and a Camry in my
household. I prefer driving the Galant
as my work car, since I drive 100 miles
round trip.
The interior aesthetics of the Altima
and Camry are nicer. If the year was
1975 and the car was a BMW. The interior
would look just great. My point is at 53
years of age the interior aesthetics are
not that important. Especially, when I
would have paid thousands more for an
Altima or Camry.
I've put 2000 miles on it and the Galant
still has a new car feel about it at
33,300 miles."

mitsubishi,galant,2003,Baltimore Buyer, 12/12/2004,Satisfied Buyer,4," I am VERY pleased with the handling 
and how smooth the car is. Lots of 
space on the front seat (I am 6'02"") 
and the truck. Very comfortable and 
luxury interior.  Little space on the 
back seats (I think this was corrected 
in the new Gallant). The engine has 
very good power for a V4 and such a 
big car. Both a/c and heater do a 
perfect job. The only serious problem 
is the poor gas economy. The car makes 
24 m/g (average city/hwy), while my 
old Sentra with 160K miles regularly 
got me 30 m/g."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Huey, 01/03/2005,Outstanding Car,4,"Absolutely loved it. It handled as well as my 
taurus (which cost about 3 grand more than 
my galant) the gas mileage could be a bit 
better, but not bad, im averaging about 20 
city and 25 highway. The car is packed with 
features for the price. Can't be beaten. The 
front seats are very comfortable, the back 
can be a bit tight for adults, mainly for 
smaller children. Great acceleration, and 
great stopping time. Love the design. The 
""INFINITI"" surround sound system is 
awesome, clear as a bell at full volume. 
headreasts are comfy, the fog lights are a 
nice feature to have, The transmisssion 
perfoms like a champ, great dependablility"
mitsubishi,galant,2003,KSpec, 04/25/2005,2003 Mitsubishi Galant ES,4,"After 2.5 years of ownership, this car has been a real pleasure to own. Mileage is around 25 around town and 29 on the highway. Steering is precise and the brakes and accelerator are responsive. Even though it only has the 140 HP engine, Mitsubishi put the torque where it is most useful which makes the car more responsive than you would otherwise expect. This is the 2nd 2003 Galant we owned. the first only lived a few months before it got totalled, but saved our lives as we were hit from behind at a very high rate of speed. We're alive because of this car!"
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Tracy, 07/18/2005,Finally Got a Good One,4,"Although I've only had it a month.... I love it!  It is my dream car!  It's very classy and sophisticated yet still sporty and stylish for young peoples' tastes.  I'm still figuring the fuel economy, but so far, it's better than my past 2 Chryslers and my Ford.  I'm a bit curious as to the transmission.. it doesn't shift as smoothly or as quickly as when I first drove it.  Handling is very fun (on dry roads anyways, should've gotten traction control). AC is awesome, sun/moonroof is awesome, stereo sounds great except for a rattling speaker, overall I love it!"
mitsubishi,galant,2003,platinum, 02/21/2006,'03 Galant V6 - Excellent Car All Around,4,"I bought my 2003 Mitsubishi Galant ES V6 in April of '04 with 3,200 miles on it and driven about 2,000 miles a month every month since then (School 75 mls away & Work is 20) with a current 62,500 miles. To say the least, the car is EXCELLENT. Fast, comfy, reliable, and strong! The tires lasted 60,000 miles, brakes are still original and make absolutely no noise. Its engine, tranny, suspension, all lighting, and electrical are perfect and the interior is still perfect.  The 3.0L 195HP V6 engine is AWESOME.  It has quick acceleration and needed no maintenence.  This car also has a nice, clear stereo.  I average 22-25 mpg.  It has a very smooth ride even on rough roads and a very low noise level on the highway.  The galant is a very impressive vehicle, especially for the push it's been given."

The car looks brand new, the interior design is a little boring but I like the feel of the seats. Its accelaration is fair.  This car comes standard with a lot of great features like keyless entry, CD player, power locks, windows, brakes, cruise control, etc. The air conditioning is great! I've only had this particular model for two days, but I've had the 1996 model for about seven years."

I replaced the temperature control switch for the heat / air conditioning.  I have kept up with regular maintenance and it has paid off!  The only complaint I have is the gas mileage could be better.  I get about 22 or 23 mpg with mixed city and highway.  Compared with a Honda this is low!  All in all I enjoy my Galant though!"
mitsubishi,galant,2003,jsmith, 05/31/2007,Great car,4,"I bought this car July of last year, and have been very happy.  It's just a base model but has all the features I could need (power, air, remote).  My previous car was a Honda Accord, which I loved but I couldn't afford to buy another one at that point.  I have to say this car is very similar to my Accord.  It has nice acceleration, handling, and I actually like it more than I thought I would. The best part is that I have not had to fix it once all year, and I have put 25,000 miles on it.  I drive a lot and live in a harsh 4-season climate, this car has handled them all well.  I really would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an affordable, reliable car."
mitsubishi,galant,2003,Georgia Girl, 04/30/2003,I like it,4,"I""m relatively new to the design as my 
last Galant was a '94 and ultimately 
was crashed and totalled due to someone 
rear-ended me. The '94 sort of folded 
around me as the car hit me from behind 
and pushed me into a cement barrier. I 
was not injured. But the '03 has many 
of the same features as my old Galant 
and handles even better. The steering 
is tight and it handles like a larger 
car and not the mid-size that it is. 
The engine has got a lot of pep for a 4-
cyl. in my opinion and the new Steel 
Blue is just gorgeous. The a/c blows 
ice cold air and the gets good 
reception although the rear speakers 
don't seem to be of high quality."

The Heater gave out but the warranty covered the damages. The Brakes need to be services a bit too often. But other than that, this car is a gem. Always starts on point and has no issues to date. I do a lot of highway driving so gas mileage is OK for me. However city driving does tend to eat away at the gas mileage a bit faster. The horsepower is adequate. Sound system is great. Body is OK. Front bumper is very sensitive. Resale for the owner is terrible, but is favorable for a used car buyer. I highly recommend this car for someone wishing to purchase a reliable used car."

We live in the desert so to go without air is NOT an option. We have put more money into fixing the air than our car is even worth.

I purchased the 2004 Galant as a dealer car.
It had 12,000 miles on it.
This car has had 1 problem w/AC condenser around 80,000 mi and it cost us $800 to repair. I've never waited for parts.
At 130,000 mi we had the timing belt replaced and while engine was apart we had oil pump and seals replaced as preventive main.
It cost us $900.
We have 210,000 on the car now and it's going strong.

For one, the parts are usually very expensive and most shops will not have them on hand.
For special parts you have to order them from Japan and can only order on Tue and Thursdays and it takes about a week to get them in.
The major issue of all the issues I have had is with the brakes.
Have had 5 brake jobs in the last year and a half.
Have had the belt break, the power steering pump go out, had to get the alignment done several times and now I am having an issue either shocks are blown or sway bar link needs replacement.
The car looks nice, but it has been a NIGHTMARE!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2004,cory izzo, 06/03/2008,Should have bought one sooner,4,"I just bought my '04 Galant a week ago and i have just got to say how amazing it is. The ride is quiet and smooth. the engine is very powerful at 230 horses and makes everyday driving a joy. the exterior is a head turner. i really couldn't ask for more. I just got out of a '97 Cherokee with 203k on it and had nothing but problems. Though the interior could have used a few updates, i really can't complain, the overall ride is great.To anyone in the market for a new car, really consider a look at this car. drives awesome for not a lot of dough.

mitsubishi,galant,2004,Luv2hateit, 05/13/2009,Love To Hate It,4,"Love the car, except for a few issues. Had to do the brakes a few times, the tail lights and head lights constantly need to be replaced, car has a horrible blind spot and my sun roof stinks!!!!!! Every single time you open it  the headliner pops out of the trim. And when I took it into  the dealer I was told that they are aware of the problem but they don't know how to fix it! "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,chris, 08/08/2009,********BAD A/C********,4,I have had this car for five years and I have had to fix the a/c about 5 to 6 times. The engine is great but there is a big problem with the a/c.
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Andrew, 09/10/2005,Gas Hog,2,"I didn't buy the 2004 Mitsubishi Galant, mine was just a long-term rental while my car was recovering from an accident and waiting for parts, etc.  It is a nice car, but the seats don't have much for lumbar support, even the driver's seat.  There is plenty of legroom though (I'm 6'2"") and the power was nice.  I was disappointed that my 1996 Saturn SL2 gets a whopping 10+ more MPG than this newer sedan.  I wouldn't buy it for that reason alone.  It only churned out 17-20 MPG depending on my ratio of city / highway driving.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,tycosales, 02/29/2004,Best Galant since '91-'92 VR4s,5,"My wife needed to replace her 100K+
miles '94 Accord wagon so we looked at
the Sonata, Accord, Camray, Altima,
Maxima, Mazda 6, and a '03 Galant GTZ
(loaded)
While testing the GGTZ, a '04 Black LS
came out of the dealers prep area. The
test drive sealed the deal. I did Edmund
research for several days and had the $$
I'd pay. Before I whipped out my price,
the sales mngr offered $.73 over, sold.
I own a 1991 Mits Galant VR4 (awd,
turbo, a pre-Evo) and if it were stock,
the 3.8 v6 would walk all over it. Crain
Mits was very professional, no BS. Go to
them if in Arkansas.  

 "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Burg82, 08/05/2004,Mitsubishi's rebirth,5,"The Galant is an exceptional value and 
a great car to drive.  Pick-up on the 
LS Galant is terrific w/ no lag time.  
Handling is more like a sports car 
rather than a 4dr sdn.  Styling is 
sporty yet practical.  Roominess is 
great for a family of four.  This 
vehicle is the best vehicle I have 
owned to date."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Valentine, 08/20/2004,Best Car I've Owned,5,"We first drove the 2004 Galant as a 
rental car in Colorado. We were very 
impressed on how the 2004 Galant 
handled while driving in Rocky 
Mountain National Park. The car hugged 
the curves going up and coming down 
the mountain, very impressive. When it 
came time to purchase a new car the 
2004 Galant was very affordable for 
our family budget. The V6 has power. 
The inside is very roomy compared to 
other cars in it's class. The ride is 
quiet and smooth. This car is great!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2004,RK, 09/04/2009,2004 Galant ES Bought at 45k miles,4,"I bought a 2004 Mitsubishi Galant ES in July 2009 from a Mitsubishi Dealership (Schaumburg, IL). I had a fantastic experience with the dealer by the way. The car was at 45k miles and 1-owner when I purchased. Good used-car bargain. Came with great features including powered sunroof, infinity audio system, 17"" alloy wheels and leather strapped steering wheel. Excellent control and driving performance. Low on the mileage (I get around 22 mpg city and highway mix). Haven't used in snow yet... hopefully it will drive well. Love the exterior and the looks."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,CJ4482, 08/06/2010,Decent Nice Car,4,"This is my 1st Mitsubishi. It's a nice car, decent and I enjoy driving it. I've had A/C problems way too much and the back seating is kind of tight. I would recommend this car for a 1st timer, or a commuter car, poor gas mileage, although I do like this car, I will not be buying another one nor will I be buying any other Mitsubishi."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Silver Magic, 03/16/2004,Chemical X,5,"This car is faster and more powerful 
than the 99 Galant. My only 
disappointment is that all models did 
not have the fog lights like before nor 
did they have the woodgrain dash I 
love.Only the GTS has it.I will miss 
the Barcelona Red which is my favorite 
color but overall this is an 
outstanding remake and it's fun to 
drive."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,mRmill05, 07/20/2008,Sharp looking Reliable car !,5,"I purchased my 04` used with 20,000 miles. Great car. Mitsubishi dealer gave me double its trade in value when it was traded up to an '09."

mitsubishi,galant,2004,Simps79, 03/27/2009,I must have a lemon,2,"I bought my Galant brand new in 2004.  I've had more problems with my car than any other car I've ever had.  Within the first 6 months, my horn stopped working which is pretty dangerous if I needed it to prevent an accident.  I had squeaky breaks for months and paid over $900 to fix the problem.  After replacing them twice and they still squeaked I ended up having to buy ceramic brake pads and that stopped the squeaking but I had to get management involved to even fix the problem.  My headlights go out often! I've just been very disappointed with this car.  I'm trying to keep it until it falls apart because the value has decreased too much.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Last time owner, 01/02/2008,Mitzu not so great,3,"Have been very disappointed.  Mileage is poor, 21 mpg city, 26-28 highway, even after K&N filter and Mobil 1 oil, must use 89+ gas.  Ride is very choppy, there is no give in rear end.  The brakes, I almost forgot, brakes stopped working when temp. dropped below freezing!  Had to have master cylinder replaced.  On the plus side, there is plenty of room for 4 adults. Thye dash is great at nite. "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Jen, 06/08/2009,Love My Galant!,4,"I have had my Galant for 5 years now (bought it new from the dealer) and I am STILL getting compliments on it!  I had a co-worker recently remark on the blue lights in the dash and how cool they were, and another one comment on the color and how sporty it looked.  I still love the pick up with this car.  Very reliable car.  They only issue I have had with it so far are the brakes, but I just chalk that up to regular maintenance issues (I had to replace them after 35,000 miles).  This car is great in ice, snow and heavy rains along with nice, sunny days!  "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Peter, 01/06/2005,Galant,4,There is no equivalent vehicle in the same price range. 10yr/100k mile warranty is simply amazing. The car is solid and a pleasure to drive. Extremely happy with our purchase.
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Deidric S. Cave, 01/06/2005,Great!,5,"I owned many cars before becoming a full-time biker. I bought the 2003 Galant for my wife right before my travels took me overseas. This car makes me want to get behind the wheel again. Its styling is superb, in my opinion. It's a blast to drive. Even though I bought the basic DE model, I'm suprised with the comfort package that comes standard with the Galants... big 16"" wheels and room for a growing family of four. This car is pretty good on gas too. I'd recommend this car to anyone."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,rob, 01/11/2005,Happy so far,4,"I have a 4-cylinder Mitsubishi Galant ES.  It has plenty of power. This car is much bigger than you think. I was considering the Chevrolet Malibu, but the Galant is longer and wider. it is fun to drive and is very cool looking. I knew the gas mileage wasn't the best but it is a big 4-cylinder engine (2.4L). I have 1,000 miles on mine so far.  It handles the bumps in the road very well.  At 70 mph you think you are in a much bigger car. It is very smooth."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,jdm7018, 02/27/2005,Best sedan ever manufactured!,5,"This being my second Galant in 3 years should be enough to prove their impact on me personally.  I'll keep this short and sweet.   The new designed body style keeps the same Galant that we have all grown to love!  I tried an 04 Accord, and compared to my Galant, it stunk."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Stuckey, 05/03/2005,Huge Step Up From 2000 to 2004 Galant,4,"I always liked my 2000 Galant but after driving the 2004 model I feel like I've moved up from a small economy sedan to a very well appointed and substantial mid-size sedan.  I bought my 2000 Galant in part based on its very sharp looking body lines.  The 2004 model is not quite as unique as the 2000, but much more exciting than the generic body styles of the Camry, Accord, and 626s.  The Altima also seems to be the exception to the body blues.  Where the 2004 Galant really seperates itself from the 2000 model and the rest of the pack is in its absolutely gorgeous interior.  The car rides, tracks and steers nicely.  It has very good visability, comfortable seats and is EXTREMELY FAST!"
mitsubishi,galant,2004,kennyrogers, 11/17/2003,the best galant ever,5,"the 04' galant is the fastest, most

mitsubishi,galant,2004,Rick Pedersen, 11/30/2003,Japaneese Marvel,4," Over the last couple of years, I 
can't believe the level this automaker 
has reached. It is now award winning 
with their cars and their technology 
and deign is amazing. I gave a couple 
of midsize cars a run, namely the 
Camry, Accord, Galant, Passat and 
Altima. They are all great cars and 
but when deciding on the car for me, 
it was easy to choose the Galant. The 
new model feels so much like a luxury 
car. It looks different and has 
impeccable quality and feels safe on 
the road. The car is quick, very much 
like the Accord but had a more sporty 
feel. Well done Mitsubishi, and I 
think you may see a record year of 
sales of this well thought-out Galant."

moved this model up a serious notch from
2003.  While searching the web for a
$20,000 car, the new Galant popped up
and caught my eye with its new style and
much improved gas milage.  We intended
try the Accord, Civic Hybrid, and the
Galant.  After seeing the Galant, we
walked across the street to the Honda
dealership and found both cars to be
boring and tired in appearance and
performance. We returned to purchase the
Galant with fun packages like a moon
roof, 6 CD changer, 16"" wheels, etc. and
still stay in our price range.  Great
pick-up and smooth sailing!  No
irritating pings or problems either."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Beachnsunlvr, 12/23/2003,My 2003 Christmas Gift,5,"The new Galant is outta this world. I

The ride is smooth and easy. Its also 
been great in the snow."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Harsh Vyas, 12/27/2003,HarsH's GaLaNt,5,"Inside, it has a very roomy, and a 
luxurious interior, when you go with 
the leather package, The trunk is 
preety big too, and the head room is 
real good, not made for ppl over 6'4 
But for a normal 5'8-6'2 its perfect. 
And the sunroof works like a 
charm...Though the one thing that 
might disturb some is the new 
mitsubishi styling,the front nose 
piece. But if you learn to live with 
it, or actually like it like i do, You 
just got yourself a real real good car 
that stands out and is no match for 
those new accords or camry's and the 
altimas."

Mitsubishi Galant owner and this one 
out does the previous generation of 
Galants. The v6 engine really moves 
this car fast, lots of low end torque 
and very good handling for a sedan. I 
got a great deal at Capital City 
Mitsubishi, and I am the first to own 
an 04 Galant in my town."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Willyd, 01/03/2004,Galant GTS Great Car,4,"Have driven this car less than 1000
miles, but it is evident this is a great
car for my rush hour commutes. Good ride
/ handling compromise with a sporty feel
but not too jaring ride. The body seems
to be solid as a rock. You can hear the
engine when you push it, but it has a
great tone. Super stereo and a decent
sized trunk that is easy to access. I
got a light silver exterior color that
shimmers and the black interior. Great
looking combination. The most important
feature is a decent price for the car.
At a little less than the average price
car you get a Galant that is fun,
confortable, and loaded with great
options. Good job.  "

THE BEST CAR I CAME ACROSS IN YEARS AS 
YOU CAN SEE I AM NO LONGER A HONDA 
OWNER. I HAVE LOOKED AT THE ACCORD LX 
V6 AND THE CAMRY AND OTHERS AND AFTER 
DRIVING THE GALANT WITH THE 3.8 LITRE 
V6 I WAS EXTREAMLY IMPRESSED WITH THE 
POWER AND THE HANDLING. THIS SHOULD BE 
CONSIDERED A SPORTS SEDAN OR A DRIVERS

SPORTS CAR. "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,wagales, 01/12/2004,Very Pleased,4,"I was very impressed with the new look 
of the Galant online, and even liked it 
better in person.  Interior is much 
roomier than my 2000 Galant was, and 
styling, both in and out is excellent. 
You can actually read the gauges 
through the steering wheel.  Trunk is 
large and has a passthru area for long 
stuff.  Iwas somewhat aprehensive about 
the 4 cylinder, but it;s peppy on the 
Interstate with plenty of passing 
power. Ride is stiff and sporty, but 
this will probally soften a bit like my 
2000 did.  Very impressed and very 
happy."

everyone is driving such as the Accord

as the Mazda6, Mitsubishi Galant, 
Nissan Altima and VW Passat. Of all 
the cars I tested, the Galant proved 
to be the best built car out of the 
bunch. It has power like no other

car drives verey nice and looks 
decent. "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,GE04, 12/29/2005,Great Value for the Money,4,"I have owned my Mitsubishi Galant for about twenty months now.  It is a great car, yery fast with excellent handling.  However, I am not as happy with the ride at highway speeds.  The car tends to jump around with the road surface. It does not feel well planted.  Other than that everything else is wonderful.  I especially like the 280 watt Infinity sound system. The car is also a head turner with its agressive looks. Other people, especially those driving the Pontiac Grand Prix, always want to race. It's hard to beat 0 to 60 in 6.5 sec."

very well and that V6 is powerful yet 
smooth.  I was driving down the 405 
freeway going over 100MPH and didn't 
even realize it.  It felt like I was 
only going 65.  My little Focus has

years with a Galant, never had any 
problems. Good on gas, but this GTS has 
a 6 cylender engine, compaired to the 
other 4 cylinders that i owned. I don't

even better. "

the fact that it is not a top seller, 
the Mitsubishi image is very good and 
makes me proud to be a Galant owner. 
The car drives very smoothly and has 
alot of power. The quality is very 
similar to the Accord V6, so i'll say 
it's average for the price. The car is

It has 29,000 miles now. The brakes squeak 70% percent of the time. The dealer says there is nothing wrong and that's normal. I had the brakes replaced after 25,000 miles and they still squeak. Also, the interior rattles. My car doesn't even always start the first time. The sunroof scrapes when it's closing.  It doesn't have good pick up when trying to go from 60 to 80. It takes a few seconds to actually pick the speed up when doing that. Mitsubishi dealer service is terrible. The hubcaps get dirty quickly"

very quick with suck you back in the

nothing like the past model.  The 
vehicle is all new, bigger, wider, more 
refined.  The exterior and interior 
styling is very modern, yet clean.  
There is plenty of room for five 
people.  The new 4 cyl. engine with the 
Valve timing system provides 6 cylinder 
performance with 4 cyl. economy.  I had 
been to many dealers in the S. Florida 
area,  I finally bought at Phil Smith

with the deal, the service and the way 
I was treated."

i was 13 and i told myself i was going 
to get a galant i am glad i waited for 
the new galant body style before 
getting the older model i would have  
really been unhappy but never the less 
i am definately a mitsubishi fan i have 
2 mitsubishis before this one a mirage 
and galant and i will tell you what i 
will stay with mitsubishi as far as i 
am concern. I love the sportronic 
feature in my car it makes it a fun 
toy. Just word of advice if you are in 
the south florida area, don't get your 
car from Delray Mitsubishi their sales 
manager is really rude and don't put 
their customers as num.1 priority!!!"

mitsubishi,galant,2004,SomeCarReviewer, 05/10/2004,Rented the Galant,3,"I get a chance to rent different cars, 
this week it was this car.  I like 
Mitsubushi, but seems like the 
Japanese rip-off of the Chevy Impala - 
minus the ugly tail lights, 50 lb 
doors and GM craftsmanship.

Cost-cutting apparent. Good car for a 
spend thrift who doesn't care about 
looks and wants solid wheels. Probably 
low resale.

They need to pick better materials 
other than the cheap/hard/sand 
textured plastic.  Run your hand over 
this and then think about a three hour 
road trip  brutal.

Need gas cap lock, unless you want 
your gas siphoned or bake cookies in 
your engine."

my fiance has one and I had one until 
it was in a car accident and I had to 
go looking for another car.  I never 
considered the Galant because I didn't 
know a lot about it, I had seen 
commercials all over the place about 
the eclipse but the galant was an 
afterthought.  I have the V4 and when I 
test drove it I though I was driving a 
V6 and commented to the dealer that as 
a V6 it was a tad sluggish, they 
said, ""no, you tested the V4"", well I 
take it back, as a V4 its got a little 
bit of a zing then!  I am still getting 
used to it and continue to be a loyal 
fan of Nissan, but Mitsubishi isn't far 
off!"

good gas mileage in the city. Todate, 
that milage is about 35% less than what 
was qouted. The service manager told me 
the car needed to be broken in before I 
would see better gas mileage numbers, 
however, he also said that my city 
driving would only yield about 18 MPG 
instead of the 23 MPG as adversited; 
with the explaination, that the 23 MPG 
qouted was an estimate. So far I'm 
getting a little less that 15 MPG, in 
my opinion, a far cry from the qouted 
numbers. "

pleased with this car and would 
recommend you take a hard look if

mitsubishi,galant,2004,GW Altenburg, 06/12/2004,"Rating the 2004 Galant, 4cyl.ES Sedan",4,"  I felt an immediate adrenaline rush 
during my first acceleration.  The 
engine actually growled that deep 
throaty roar of a racing machine, my 
head snapped back, and my body was 
pressed into the seat.  All this with 
just a 4 cylinder.2.4 liter engine.  
The steering was a bit stiff, but very 
responsive to the slightest adjustment. 
The ride was not cushy and was even 
jarring at times on roads that were not 
perfectly smooth. This might be 
objectionable to those looking only for 
creature comforts, but for the person 
looking for the exhilerating driving 
experience, this is one mean machine."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Hovey, 06/12/2004,Check out the GTS--it's worth your time,4,"I have only one beef with my new GTS--
the gas mileage isn't great.  I'd still

is a head turner.  The engine is peppy

able to work a few dealer specials to 
really take a whack at the price.  I 
got 200 gallons of gas, 3 Years of 
Free Schedule Maitance, $2000 Cash

several months before buying in May. I 
test drove the new Altima, Camry, 
Stratus, and Accord. The Galant out 
does them all in performance and 
design. And, what a great price! If 
you are in the market to buy a mid-
size sedan you must test drive the new 
Galant.  Watch out for the gas 
mileage - you will not get 23 MPG!"

exactly what I wanted...The Mitsubishi 
Galant.  It has style, sophistication 
and sportiness along with comfort, 
roominess and reliability for the 
money.  Sure I could have gotten an 
Accord, Camry or Altima, but for the 
same money I get extra features in my 
Galant.  When I was finally able to go 
out to get a new car, I went right to 
my local Mitsubishi dealer, pointed out 
the 1 car I wanted to test drive and 
took it home that afternoon.

Mercedes-Benz vehicles, i was 
skeptical of buying a Mitsubishi 
Galant as a secondary car, which i 
would later give to my son.  However, 
this car has won me over.  I purchased 
with the warranty, saftey and power 
specs in mind, but the automobile 
itself is excellent.  I am impressed 
by the design, power and quality of 
the car.  This car is a great 
alternative to the Accord, Camry or 
Altima, for those who think the 
aforementioned three are just a tad 
staid.  This car has a sport-oriented 
soul, and i am pleased with my 
purchase."

Bought it 2 days later. I went on a 
test drive loved the new style and 
features they changed. More leg room 
and trunk. Saw it, drove it, bought it,
Love it!"
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Juiceman, 07/20/2004,"Good price, good car",4,"Coming out of an infiniti G35 it is 
hard to brag about this car but it did

got a car I could live with at a good 
price.  5 year 60K bumper to bumper, 10 
yr 100K powertrain and 3 yr 45K free 
service at no additional cost

Dealership is close to home, car looks 
good, interior is alittle low end but 
you get what you pay for.  LArge 
interior and pretty quiet ride.  Great 
family car.  Do not worry about how I 
treat it as it is a cheap car.  This

mitsubishi,galant,2004,S&L, 07/25/2004,"We love this ""crazy"" car!",4,"Before we bought this Galant we were 
looking for Altimas, Hondas,etc., 
except Toyota as we don't believe its 
worth the money they asked for.

Galant outperforms them all; it can be 
driven either gently or like a 
racehorse, accelerates very quickly, 
stable and reliable on the road, easy 
in maintenance. In other words 
excellent and very reasonable  buy for 
end user. "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,atl842, 07/26/2004,Great Sedan,4," I was a little bit unsure about 
purchasing the Galant over the usual 
Accord, Camry, or Altima. Today I am 
very pleased with the decision of the 
Mitsubishi. The car is quiet, fast, and 
comfortable and I don't feel like I 
just blend in with the crowd. "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Perdomo & Veloza, 07/30/2004,Amareno,5,"This is the fourth new Mitsubishi we 
have. This is top of the line for us, a 
colombian gay couple from Queens NY, 
excellent, beautiful, quiet, powerful, 
dependable, spacious in passengers area 
and trunk. 2003 Galant was wonderful 
but not roomy enough. This 2004 galant 
engine's makes sport car noises, 
different as the 2003 voitire. We are 
happy with it, thinking on next step 
needs to be a full breed german Audi or 
Mercedes, after experiencing this nice 
mitsubishi."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,SWERVIN, 08/05/2004,The best value for your money!!!!,5,"This car by far has one of the most

warranty that the car offers. 10YR/100k 
MILES POWERTRAIN, 5YR/60k BUMPER TO

No car out has this strong of a

helpful."

feel you are in a much bigger car.  We 
absolutely love this car.  We leased 
the others, this one we bought with no 
regrets.  Unfortunately, with the gas 
prices high - well we all know."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,TXDigger, 08/22/2004,Elegance without the cost,5,"I was astounded when I saw the new 
design of the '04 Galant GTS. Black 
exterior with black interior, so 
many ""options"" are standard, it's a 
deal waiting to happen.

The ride is smooth and quiet. The 
Infinity sound system with 6-CD changer 
and EIGHT speakers...it's like a 
concert hall on the road.

It beats Lincoln LS from bumper to 
bumper. The same is true with 
the ""little"" Cadillac (can't remember 
the letters). Don't go lower than GTS. 
For less than $25K after a bit of 
dickering, you'll love it."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Razo681, 08/30/2004,GREAT NEW LOOK,4,"I love the '04 galant I traded in my 
older '01 galant (which I loved) for 
this one and I am very pleased. the 
2004 has more pickup more standard 
features, and is great fun to drive. On 
top of it all its more roomy and 
comfortable. My only gripe about the 
new Galant is the engine noise. Other 
than that I'm very pleased with the car 
so far."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,buckayou, 08/30/2004,good car for the price,3,"I have my mitsubishi galant for 5 days 
and I'am disappointed with the bumpy 
ride.  The car drives very hard, like 
theres too much air in the tires.  I 
travel alot so the main reason why I 
bought  this car was because of the 
great warranty and the low price. "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,virtualyode, 08/26/2004,Mitsu Stands Out from the crowd,4,"I did a lot of research prior to 
purchasing my new Galant. I said that I 
would never buy a sedan until I saw the 
new Galant. The car is sporty, stylish 
and built like a tank. The 2.4 mivec 
purs like a kitten and feels like a 6 
cylinder. This car is different than 
most grocery getter sedans. Mitsu is re-
engineering their North American 
operations and their products are 
getting better and better. I would 
recommend this car to anyone."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Jaxx, 09/03/2004,"Great car, bad interior",4,"Had a lease on a 2001 Eclipse so I had 
to purchase another Mistu or take a big 
hit. Drove the Galant GTS a couple of 
times, great ride, acceleration, 
handleing, features, radio, and I also 
like the lcd screen. The ice blue 
lighting looks great at night. The car 
has a lot of room, I test drove a Grand 
Prix and the Galant is bigger or just 
feels like it.

As you can tell I like the redesigned 
Galant and this is my third Mitsu. but 
the interior is bad, a lot of cheap 
materials. The sand grain rubber that 
covers the upper doors and dash is hard 
and not comfy. I sat in the Diamante, 
very nice inside why does Mitsu not use 
these materials in the Galant!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Mose, 09/04/2004,Sharp and fun,5,"We looked at all other manufactures 
vehicles at this price range and were 
much more impressed with the Galant 
than the others.  The Toyota was a 
close 2nd but they would not come off 
the price at all.  We purchased the 
Diamond package and the sunroof 
package.  The Diamond package gives a 
completly new look making the interior 
absolutely beautiful.  A great sound 
system and stylish wheels.  Head room 
and leg room is great for a sedan and 
fits our 2 child seats with no 
problem.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Unkkafesta, 09/11/2004,My 2004 Galant,4,"We've owned this car for just over a 
month. We absolutely love it. It's 
roomy, plenty of comfort for the price. 
We own the ES in Titanium Pearl, dark 
grey interior. It feels like a sports 
car in a family sedan. It's not too 
flashy, but it does turn heads. Perfect 
for the wife in sales and business 
associate, with the sporty feel that I 
like. It feels like a safe car."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,jorn96, 09/10/2004,Jo's Baby,5,"I was able to ""test drive"" it for 3 
days. I fell in LOVE with it. Superior 
handling and response. Better warranty 
than the Camry and better price. It is 
so comfortable to drive. I like the 
all wheel disc brakes, I KNOW I'm 
going to stop. It's a very classy 
looking car, with nice lines and a 
flow to it that makes you think more 
sporty than sedan. I drive for a 
living so I needed the great warrenty. 
The salesmen were also more willing to 
talk to a female than Toyota was!! 
That in itself was a bonus! Get with 
the program, Toyota... you lost a life-
time customer to Mitsubishi!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Glenn Debeljak, 09/02/2004,Take - A - Look,4,"This is my 1st Foreign car I bought. I 
looked at many before I made my 
decision. The power out of a 4 cyl was 
and still is impressive. Im a V8 guy.

has a Neat look and clean interior. I 
fun car to drive in the city & on the

mitsubishi,galant,2004,Michelle Freeman, 09/12/2004,My,4,"This is a good looking car on the 
inside and out.  I am impressed with 
the smooth and strong acceleration of 
the 4 cylinder in the ES model.  Many 
friends of mine think it looks like a 
Cadillac CTS in the rear.  I think it 
looks like a refined Altima.  I have 
been very satisfied with it so far but 
I have only had it for 2 weeks.  My 
mother has a 2003 Galant ES model and 
I really like mine better especially 
the roominess of it.  I am nearly 5'10

past, but this car beats them in 
overall performance and build quality 
(especially the piece of junk Audi). 
It's very quick with great handling and 
balance on a solid and rattle-free body 
and suspension. The interior is great 
too; I particularly like the well 
shaped and firm power seat, great sound 
system, and everything within easy 
reach. On top of all this, a 5 yr/50K 
bumper-to-bumper mile warranty with 
free maintenance for 3 yrs/45K miles."

mitsubishi,galant,2004,Vegas Joe, 09/23/2004,NO PUFFING ALLOWED,4,"Car now comes with Yokahoma tires 
instead of Bridgestone. The Yokahomas, 
for some reason, provide a bouncy ride 
whereas the Bridgestones don't.

No workmanship like Smoker's package is 
offered by Mitsubishi. All they offer 
is a cupholder insert which can't be

10,000 miles) and I find it very
reliable.  It is roomy and comfortable.
 I live in Houston which has the worst
traffic in the country and I am
impressed on how much pick up it has.  I
step on the gas and it takes off like a
rocket.  I need a car to respond given
the amount of traffic I encounter daily.
 I would recommend it to anyone who
wants a decent car, with great warranty
and economic price.  My mother has a
2003 Galant ES and other than that
version having good pickup, there is no
comparison starting with the interior

mitsubishi,galant,2004,X-Honda guy, 04/01/2005,Stealth Cruiser,4,"You'll have a grin on your face and people will wonder why... I bought a new 2004 Galant LS (MSRP $21,992) for less than a Corolla or Civic, I recieved Customer/Loyalty rebates of $5,000 plus another $2,200 from the dealer delivered LS for $14,800. ReSale is a non-issue now.  It's not a boring ride, it's fast, handles well in corners. It loves snow and mountain roads. It has an attitude lurking under that mild mannered exterior. Gets good mileage (23+) and not a penny from me for maintanence (Free!).  Pearl red paint is Candy apple in the sun. For giggles just place your right foot all the way down transforming your Ho Hum commute into an amusement park ride. Wheee!"

mitsubishi,galant,2004,kopykopron, 07/19/2005,great car,5,"I love the fact that I owne the only Galant GTS in my town, I have had this car on trips over 600 miles and less and have had the best ride i could get. The GTS turns heads every where I go, I would not trade the GTS for anything else out there at this time. This has to be one of the best decisions I've made when buying a new car. It gives me the power as well as handling I want. Once you drive it you won't want anything else."

mitsubishi,galant,2004,sfranklin, 12/19/2005,Best Car Ever,5,The 2004 Mitsubishi Galant is wonderful to drive. It drives quietly enough to promote luxury and fast enough to perform as a race car. I love this car.

I like it because of its sporty design on the inside and the outside even if this car is clasified as a family mid-size sedan.  The 2004 model has a spacious backseat.  It is fast, one can feel the push back in the seat when you accelerate."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Craig, 07/31/2006,Impressed,5,"We almost bought an '02 Altima SL before we saw the Galant.  I am really glad that we didn't get the Altima.  The Galant is so much better in so many ways.  That and the dealership was better.  I like what it comes with for the money.  Although we purchased ours used, we don't get the 10 yr/100,000 mile warranty.  Oh well, not really a big deal."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,ice1012001, 08/10/2006,Poor Car,2,I have had my Mitsubishi Galant for less than one year and the O2 sensors and the catalytic converter went out.
mitsubishi,galant,2004,S L F, 09/23/2006,My G,4,"I've owned this car for 2 1/2 years and it still handles and rides great, and is as much fun to drive today as the day I got it.  Its acceleration is great and it has lots of power.  I love to hear the sound of the engine.  It has great interior and trunk space.  I enjoy the pass through into the trunk which makes it safe to slide my purse and packages into without being seen.  An additional safety feature is the illuminated release inside the trunk, which really works.  People still stare at it and ask ""What kind of car is that?""  I smile when I tell them is's a Galant.  It's an excellent car!  My son enjoys it as much as I do."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Mrs. Robinson, 10/07/2006,Love My Third Galant!,5,"This is the third Mitsubishi Galant that I have purchased; the first was used, the second I leased and then purchased and the third I purchased. Each vehicle performed beautifully! The first was involved in a serious accident and was demolished but the driver (my mother) survived! The second I sold to a friend w/over $100,000 miles on it ~ she still has it! The third my husband purchased because he wanted me to have a vehicle with a good warranty, etc.  The only complaint I have are the brakes.  Each car needed new brakes at about 35,000 miles...but that's my ONLY complaint! If you're in the market for a great-looking car that's comfy, fun-to-drive & good on gas, check out the Galant GTS!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Jennifer, 10/07/2006,I Love My car After Two Years,5,"I have had my Galant for two years and I still love driving it.  It has torque and is comfy.  I am considering getting another, but the GTS model with a leather interior instead. I recieve top notch service from the dealer as well."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,mikedwood, 06/26/2011,Blah!,2,"I like the way it drives and it's strong as can be for a non-turbo 4 cyl, but pray to God for guidance if you need to do much more than change the oil or air filter. This is my 2nd Mitzu and my last ever. 

Parts are hard to come by and expensive! My wife got it in 2009 and in 2011 before 80,000 miles it needed a head gasket, 2 struts and plates, front axle and two 02 sensors. Parts only avalible from Mitsubishi on all but the 02 sensors.

Fortunately my mechanic works at a junk yard by day and stripped the heck out of a wreck and we were able to get about $2,000 in parts for about $500."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,lindag3, 02/21/2011,Wish I'd chosen another car,3,"I just got my Mitsubishi Galant 2 months ago (used) and thank God I got the extended warranty with it!
I just took it in to dealership last Tuesday and the ABS sensors weren't showing on the dash.
They ran into needing more parts and I don't expect it back until end of this week (almost a two week repair!).
Thank God for the courtesy car I am able to use.
I sure hope this isn't a sign of things to come with this car.
I loved it at first but this isn't good two months into a loan!
I hope to trade it in as soon as that opportunity comes up.
It wasn't great in the snow so I bought two snow tires for the front which did make a difference.
The dealership has been helpful I must say."
mitsubishi,galant,2004,Sarah, 04/09/2008,Mostly quite pleased.,4,"Have only had the car a few days, but here's my contribution. It's a gorgeous looking car, smooth ride and super quiet, hardly any road noise. Daytime running lights a nice touch. Soft, comfortable seats. I usually prefer leather but the cloth seems updated and luxurious. Very impressive stock stereo, blew my 2001 Mitsu Eclipse's stereo out of the water. Bass you can feel in your chest.  Unfortunately, the plastic cover over the mirror on the sun visor snapped off with barely any force, I simply flipped it up and it came off in my hands, rather disappointing.  A very mature, classy, and still young looking car for a professional 21 year old woman.  Overall, very pleased with the car."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,X-Men, 11/22/2010,Great Car,4,"I have bought this car for 2 months as 2nd hand and I'm loving it so far. I gives me the power when ever I needed it on a highway/city and the comfort the car gives is imaginable. Great ""Infinity"" stereo sound system with 6CD changer."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,bluemidnight, 02/15/2006,Outstanding Performance,4,"I traded in my 2002 Galant ES 4 cyl for the 2005 Galant LS V6 and was instantly happy with the performance and acceleration.  Its power drivers seat is a great plus, although it should have a memory preset.  I am extremely disappointed with the fuel economy, I am only getting about 12-15 mpg city and about 19-22 highway.  I don't slam on the gas pedal, by am usually casual while driving to / from work.  Maybe the car still isn't broken in yet with only about 3,000 miles driven so far.  The interior design appealing, but the cheap plastic on top of the dash and doors is not easy to clean.  What drew me to this car was the bold design. Its reliability has been satisfactory so far.  The build inside and out seems solid."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Nibseysgirl, 03/15/2009,Love it!!!!!!!!,4,"I bought my Galant right b4 Christmas this past year...My present to me...YAHOO. Its the first ""new"" car I have had...I am so glad I got it. Have had no issues to speak of except that the windshield washer reservoir is broken (big whole in the bottom..didn't know that till I went to put fluid in...good thing it's CHEAP...watered the ground) I have literally had to do nothing to this car since I bought it but replace worn windshield wipers and put gas in it. I think this is the smoothest nicest car I have driven. I love it..."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Knights81381, 10/11/2010,Been a very nice car,4,"Bought my car used at 23,000 miles.  I have literally have 0 problems with it.  It has been one of the greatest cars i have ever owned.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,jk, 06/04/2007,Still happy after 2 years,4,Pretty much love the car.  It's been able to do everything I've asked of it.  People still comment on how cool it looks.  Pickup is excellent.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,M. Planas, 06/29/2009,Economical & Surprising 4L,4,"Looking for an inexpensive used four cylinder sedan, came across the Mitsubishi Galant. I was most impressed with the suspension and interior comfort.  This is as good as it gets for your money."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Alan Duke, 03/21/2010,Dukes review,4,Car has smooth ride. Throttle reaction time is awesome. wide open interior. Gas mileage 26-28 mpg in town 29-31 highway. Awesome 6 disk 6 speaker stereo system. Handles well for small/midsized car. Big trunk space. Great head room. Ive owned galants since 92. Extremely dependable                 
mitsubishi,galant,2005,al4me23, 07/15/2014,Was Happy Until,4,"Car was great until it hit 80k miles...then it went downhill. I had to replace the starter, all 4 rotors, timing belt and both catalytic converters(twice) and all 5 O2 sensors(yes 5). And then the transmission started to slip at 95kmi. After the 2nd converter replacement I found out the car had at least 2 bad exhaust valves causing the converters to be blown out. I promptly traded in it after I got the check engine light code cleared. It was a good car until the end..sadly the end was relatively young for what today's car should get you mileage wise. I bought a Honda and I love it but I'm never buying a Mits again because they closed the dealership and now the closets dealer is 60miles away.
"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Tanya, 03/04/2009,Love it,5,"I was skeptical about buying my used Galant because the mileage was so high, but so far, I have no complaints about my Galant.  As long as I keep up the regular maintenance up on it, all seems to be ok."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Joe Supplee, 02/26/2005,My 2004 Galant GTS is one fine car,4,Great car (silver finish) - love the way it looks and drives.  Especially love the infinity sound system and cobalt blue dash lighting.  Rear seating is a big improvement over my 99 Galant.  Pickup is great with the V6.  I think Mitsubishi really improved this car greaty over prior models.  Glad I bought it.  I hope the reliability is a good as my 99 (no problems at 102K when I sold it)
mitsubishi,galant,2005,DeekDeezie, 03/30/2005,I Love My Galant,4,"I received a 2004 Galant as a graduation gift and I love it. I searched from Nissan to Toyota to Honda. Not only was this in my budget, it was complementary to my style and image. I feel an obligation to always keep it looking good. When I first got it, I remember after getting out of the car always having to look back at the car in disbelief that such a beauty was mine. Love the big body design. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,GetSmartAgnt86, 05/16/2005,GALANT: The most unique and fun sedan,4,"I am in love with my new car. I bought my 2005 Mitsubishi Galant GTS for many reasons. First, and most importantly, the price was within my price range. Second, it is a great car to drive. I test drove almost every other car in its class, including the Camry and Accord, and the Galant drove much smoother with better handling and performance. I love the V6 engine. It is very powerful. Third, I love the styling. The look of the new Galant is head and shoulders above pre-2004 models and above the Camry, Accord, and any other 4 door sedan for the same price. In short, I am very happy with my purchase and I look forward to many exciting miles of road ahead."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Sarge, 06/29/2005,Awesome,5,"It was between the Mazda 6 and Galant and the Galant won hands down.  Engine: The Mazda 6 was sluggish around 3,000 RPM's. The Galant however has awesome response no matter what the RPM range.  I couldn't stand the stepped style shifter in the Mazda 6, the Galant had the same type transmission however a much smother shift pattern.  Handling: This car sticks like glue, I would love to get it on a closed course and see what it's capable of."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,maurice young, 09/22/2005,Very Good So Far,4,"My Ford Econoline conversion van broke down for the last time in August 2004.  I needed something to drive that day so I had my daughter take me to the nearby Carmax store.  I was going to buy a used car that was safe and that would get better mileage than my van.  After looking at several used vehicles with limited warranties, the salesman told me about the Galants that they sold that were new and had great warranties and prices.  The styling did not blow me away but it was alright.  The test drive was ok so I went with it.  23,000 miles later I've come to really appreciate this car.  It's comfortable, reliable, has a solid ride, and reasonably good looking. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,ES, 06/19/2006,My Galant,4,"The Galant is a great vehicle that drives well.  Compared to the Nissan Altima, the Galant wins hands down.  I have a newborn and the space, comfort, and drive of the Galant are excellent."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Very satisfied, 03/06/2005,A Terrific Car to Own,5,"Having previously owned a Galant for the past 15 years and had great performance and low maintenance from it, the car inside and outside held up extremely well so we decided to purchase the new 2005 model.  It is fun to drive, comfortable, very attractive both inside and outside (very sporty looking design).  We highly recommend this car and feel it is the best buy today and Mitsubishi offers the excellent warranty program around.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Glenn, 05/09/2005,"Wow, What a Car",5,"This car is fun to drive, comfortable and affordable.  Its a great choice!!  My Kids love it too, can't wait to go somewhere in the car!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Jay, 06/17/2005,Check This Car Out!,4,"I recently traded my 2002 VW Jetta for this car and so glad I did! I test drove the Honda Accord and found the Mitsubishi SE to be a better alternative with more incentives, 0% apr, rebates, and warranty is way better than Honda (just because it isn't as popular as the Honda's I am sure) so we got a car with the same features as the Accord for $5,000 less! It has unique look with a comfortable ride and handling. I think this car has been underated my the by most of the researchers and deserves a test drive at least...I also own a 2002 Mitsubishi SUV and have had excellent luck with that...so we will see but so far i am very impressed a lot of car for the $$$. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,carguru, 07/19/2005,Mitsubishi Galant,5,The Galant is amazing. I had a Nissan Altima before and the Galant is so much better. It rides and handles far better than any other car I drove in it class.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,El Paso Galant, 08/08/2005,Best family sedan at any price,4,"My 1999 BMW M3 was getting to small for my family, so I was looking at the new BMW 540i, Infiniti G35, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Nissan Maxima and every other car under $60,000. I picked the Mitsubishi Galant GTS, the 540i was my first choice, but the wife didn't like the dash. I don't care what the spec says, but I know  my GTS is faster 0-60 mph than any of the car I test drove. I love the stereo. I still don't understand why people say Bose makes the best stereo. The blue dash light is awesome. The shiftronic is so smooth, it's like driving a manual transmission. This car is fast and very comfortable. The only way to describe this car is WOW."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Shawn, 09/21/2005,I Love My Galant GTS,4,"I am very satisfied with my Galant GTS, other than with the sound system. Perhaps it needs better speakers.  Other than that, the gas mileage could be better especially with premium fuel Grrr!"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Carrie, 04/29/2006,It's Okay,3,"We bought our 2005 Galant used with 10,000 miles on it. It has enough horsepower and the interior is very nice. I don't really like the exterior though, it looks like all doors to me. I can live with that I guess. However due to the sloping down of the roof when I pull the seat up so I can reach the pedals I have virtually no head room unless I lower the seat and then I can barely see out. Its a nice car but not built for short people. I am 5'3"". I probably won't be keeping it long because I'm tired of hitting my head."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,StanBear, 10/31/2006,The Galant has Come a Long Way,4,"I must let everyone know how far Mitsubishi has come in this evolution. Having owned two of the previous style Galants ('99 and '02) as well as Maximas, etc, I feel qualified to make a judgment. The big thing they finally got right was the room.  This car has a fantastic roomy back seat, even more so than Maxima in past. Beyond that the quality is up to snuff, and the driving experience is terrific even though only the 4-cyl. engine. I enjoy driving it more that our 2004 Cadillac DeVille DTS. Though the 4-cyl is slightly on the noisy side, it is the best of breed.  There is always enough torque and power available (better than the '89 Maxima V6). The car moves out so easily it's hard to believe, even on passing."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,John Reyle, 04/25/2007,Loving My Mitsu.,5,"I drive in town and travel the interstate. I'm disabled,and this vehicle is comfortable, has plenty of room and is easy to get in and out. The more I drive it the more I like it. I was looking for a 6cyl. but found that the 4cyl. has plenty of get-up and go for city or out on I-75. As a mech. and instructor for more than 35 yrs I think Mitsubishi did a great job redesigning the Galant!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Happy in Ohio, 09/21/2007,"Great, Fun, and Safe",4,"Bought this car on the spot after a test drive, I am very pleased with the car, I have just turned 50,000 miles on it and it still drives like the day I drove it off the lot. It has great acceleration, I have had it in the Smoky Mountains and love the handling. Needless to say I recommend this car for anyone who wants to enjoy their daily drive."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,jeff, 05/03/2008,Worth a look,3,"I have had my GTS for just under 4 years.  It's fun to drive (very quick), pretty quiet, good interior room( and looks good too, decent trunk space, handles well.  Average fuel economy for an engine this size.  My ONLY complaint about this is the turning radius is just a little to large.  If they fixed that, it would be close to perfect.  I have owned Camry's, Accords, and American sedans and this is as good as any and better than most.  Warranty is much better than most also.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun to drive sedan."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Sammy, 09/20/2016,Great and fun car,5,"This car had been great to own and drive.  It is solid and reliable.
"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,MIKE BISHOP, 04/09/2005,Dud Car,2,Our experience with this car was not what we expected for a car with a new style. Although we loved the new design the quality of the car seems to have been put together with the cheapest materials Mitsubishi could find. The test drive was nice but two weeks into ownership there seemed to be a lot more engine noise than what we experienced on the test drive. This car's initial quality was pitiful.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Dave Cook, 07/17/2005,2004 Galant ES,4,"The wife and I love this car. It is roomy and fast for a four cylinder, with excellent fuel mileage. I recommend purchasing the alloy wheels, as the plastic hubcaps are somewhat flimsy."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Nate7771, 11/01/2004,Exceptional Car - Exceptional Value!!!!!,5,"Considered the Camary and Accord..the 
Camary was as exciting to drive as a 
toaster and the Accord is becoming too 
common.  This car beats the competition 
in performance, comfort, style and has 
a decidedly aggressive attitude the 
competition lacks!  Its extremely 
responsive engine is backed up by an 
intuitive transmission that makes the 
driving experience both rewarding and 
involving!  I've heard some complaints 
about interior materials or ""Robbie The 
Robot"" dashboard - I disagree!  The 
materials are of high quality and the 
dash / ergonomics couldn't be better!  
Then there's the Infinity 8 speaker 
stereo system....in a word, WOW!!! I 
love this car and very glad to have 
purchased Mitsubishi!  "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Dee 39203, 06/17/2008,AC Broke,3,"At first I loved my Galant, but since the AC went out, I've been in what has literally felt like hell. I have an all black leather interior which draws heat.   I took the car to the shop and my air conditioner is broken.  I was told that it would cost $941.00 to fix it.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Eugene, 12/21/2004,Car with the Spirit,5,I do not have any problems with this car after driving 12000 miles. 
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Tennessee driver, 01/07/2005,Great car for a great deal.,5,"We wanted to wait a little longer to purchase a new vehicle, but our old car would not wait.  We wanted a good car for a relatively low price, and after a little research, we found our car.  We have had many compliments on it, and the only problem we have had is the delay on the wipers was slightly off.  Otherwise, it has been a great car.  We love it, and our son loves that he has more room.  My husband is 6'2"" and I am 5'11"".  We are both able to sit with the seat all the way back, and someone of our size can still sit behind us.  It's great!"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Daryl, 02/15/2005,2004 Galant GTS,5,This is my second purchase of the top end Galant that is offered from Mitsubishi.  I love the control and power with out sacraficing comfort and luxury. I love the car.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Andrew, 03/01/2005,Worth Checking Out!,5,"I have owned my Galant for nearly 6 months, and I still find myself staring at it.  The exterior was designed for all ages.  I feel proud owning a Mitsubishi considering it is built in Bloomington, Illinois by UAW workers.  Ask anyone who works at Mitsubishi and they will tell you that they are proud of what they build.  The engine is very responsive and the torque put out is amazing for a 4 cylinder.  The 8-speaker Infiniti sound system is amazing.  The interior turns many heads at night with the blue dash lights.  I was also attracted to the Galant because of one of the best warranties around, 10-year- 100,000 thousand miles.  Plus I get 3 years maintenance and roadside assistance. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Fast Eddie, 03/27/2005,Nice Ride,5,We looked hard for several months and decided on the Galant. The Korean cars didn't have the quality of construction and lacked the performance and styling.The warranty and price were a big issue when compared to Toyota and Honda. 
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Matte51082, 03/27/2005,GTS,5,"This car is mint. When I first saw the 2005 Galant I thought they where kind of plain looking and there wasn't much to them and I love the the Galants, i had a 2001 model and I loved that car. When i saw the 2005 GTS Galant I feel in love with it. I have the black one with creme interior and i just love everything about it. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Kathleen Wheeler, 03/30/2005,Great Car/Good Price,5,"I have had my new Lancer for two weeks and absolutely love it so far.  It is stylish, seems well built, and gets good gas mileage.  This is my third Mitsubishi and may prove to be my favorite.  Six days after I purchased my car my best friend backed her SUV into the driver's side front fender of my new car. I have found that the Lancer holds up very well under attack and it actually relatively inexpensive to repair.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Joe Cowan, 04/09/2005,2004 Mitsubishi Galant ES,5,"This is my second Galant ES.  The first was a 2001 that I drove for 3 touble free years.  I particularly like the free roadside service, free maintenance and customer service. One of my sisters-in-law drove the car and thought (my 4-cyl) was a V6.  Even teenagers who hardly notice such things have commented how smooth the ride is.  I just giggle and keep on enjoying the ride, the Infinity 6 disc in-dash, six speaker stereo and the admiring comments from others. I am probably a Mitsubishi customer for life."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Dan, 04/14/2005,2005 Galant = Best New Mide-Size Car,5,"This car is the complete package.  It has a great exterior design,roomy and stylish interior, nice 6 speaker CD/AM/FM stereo, stylish blue dash lights, drives smoothly, low engine noise, and handles very well.  This is the best Mid-Size Car for the money out there.  This car has everything that a Camry, Accord, or Altima has but for a lower price.  Also, it has the best warranty out there today."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Patrick, 04/14/2005,Every Thing You Need,4,"As you can see the Galant has a very attractive design, especially for a 4 door. It has exellent acceleration and rides smooth at high speeds. The Galant has more leg room then some trucks and SUVs that I have been in.  I'd rather watch t.v. in my Galant then my lazy boy. The only complaint I have is its turning radius does not meet my standards."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Steven G. Johnson, 04/15/2005,good deal for the $,4,"peppy 4 cylinder, dealer added leather to the ES which we liked. Fun to drive and a good deal for the money. We traded a 2003 eclipse 5 speed and this car is quicker"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,doogienj, 05/01/2005,Beats Altima,4,"I work in the car rental business, so I often change cars that I use as company cars.  My previous car was the Pontiac Grand Prix.  The V4 engine is a bit sluggish with the acceleration, like there is a delay when you floor it.  But when you get it up to speed, it performs great and you are very comfortably at 80 mph.  The breaks are great right off the bat.  I'm not sure if it has traction control or not.  If it does, it's not great.  So it's a bit tough to accelerate from wet pavement.  I have previously driven the Nissan Altima as a company car and I'm not sure why it's hailed as the category leader.  It's nosier than the Galant, feels much lighter and flimsier. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,leftofcenter, 05/13/2005,My New 2005 GTS,5,"This car is awesome! I test drove a new Mustang, Atima, and an Accord.  The Mustang is hot on the outside but not really as comfy or functional as the GTS on the inside. I wanted comfort, luxury, and originality and boy, does this baby have it. I love the interior and the dashboard, especially at night - i'm not sure why there are complaints. It's bigger than my old 2000 Galant ES. My friend has a BMW 325 and i have to say i like my GTS much better. More legroom (i'm only 5'2) and functionality on the inside. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,MIKES, 05/27/2005,Galant ES,5,The only thing I don't like is the material they use for the dashboard and upper door panel. It is very hard to clean the rough surface. Other than that it is a great car averaging 22 mpg city and 30 on hwy. 4 cylinder is plenty powerful enough.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,LoveMyMitsu, 06/27/2005,Pretty as a Pearl,5,"I was considering the Chrysler 300, but didnt like it after the test drive (the viewing is really limited especially for the blind spot. Driving home a little depressed I stopped by the Mitsubishi dealership and was impressed with the style of the Gallants...went home did some research and a week later bought my car! The Dover Pearl color looks awesome and I'm saving to put some 19"" rims. I love the smooth fast ride. Gas is pretty average (28-32 bucks to fill her up) I got a crazy deal 0 down 0 APR which was nearly impossible at the Chrysler dealerships. Overall, I love my car, love the price, and love the warranty.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,TamaraJN818, 07/21/2005,Vroom Vroom,4,"I really like this car, I upgraded from a Neon :( and this car really has it all - even though its the base model, I don't feel cheated at all.  I used these reviews prior to purchasing this car - and I do agree, the car makes a really loud noise when you got to accelerate.  But fuel economy is great (got 475 miles of HWY on one trip).  The molding of the body of the car can sometimes make it hard to see other passing vehicles - but its all and all a great car and I would defintely recommend it."

mitsubishi,galant,2005,J. Haupt, 09/14/2005,I'm Impressed,4,"Sought a car for my daughter and looked high and low on the internet and at dealers. Bought the Galant at a great price and have been astonished by the features they have packed in this vehicle.  For a 4 cyl. it has amazing power and at speed it is so quite. No vibration at all from the engine and the body is so tight and the fit is perfect.  The interior is large and comfortable and the style looks high tech.  The materials appear to be high end and the dash is very modern and efficient.  I didn't want all the bells and whistles, but this car gave me so many. The radio/CD are first class. All controls are well designed and easy to reach. Wife drives a Lincoln LS and she loves the Galant."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Steve, 01/22/2006,Awesome Overall Car,4,The 2005 Mitsubishi Galant has all the features one would want without having a huge price tag to accompany it.  I love driving it and everyone I know has been very impressed by the vehicle appearance inside and out.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,walkerci, 10/17/2004,Best value for a midsize car,4,"What attracted me to the Galant is 
value for the money, style, 
performance, interior room, and the 
great warranty.   You simply cannot get 
more car for the money.

My Galant was built with UAW labor and 
more than 50% US part content, so I can 
even feel a bit patriotic about my 
decision.

My other cars are a 1999 VW Passat GLS 
and a 1997 VW Jetta GT.  I considered 
buying another Passat, but the 
difference in price didn't seem worth 
it to me. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Carl, 02/05/2005,Galant GTS,5,Handles extemely well and has good acceleration.  Very smooth at high speeds on the interstate.  The stereo is awesome.  Have had some problems with the sunroof but these were resolved by the dealership.  As of this time at 23000 miles it has been flawless.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Tampa Galant, 02/08/2005,Tampa Galant,4,"Great car, purchased it over a 2005 Chrysler 300 Limited, Nissan Altima and Honda Accord....Great car, great ride and handling, I purchased the GTS model and I dont feel like another ""cookie cutter"" car on the road....unique and fun, great warranty, and the dealership was no pressure and extremely helpful. Would recommend the car and the dealership to all my friends."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,mrtestcell, 03/07/2005,2005 Mitsubishi Galant,4,"This is a fun and smooth car to drive.  I had a 2003 Galant that I traded in for this one and there is no comparison.  A full size person can now fit in the back seat comfortably.  The 3.8 V6 rocks the house too, in comparison to the 2.4L 4 cylinder.  Overall Mitsubishi did a great job redesigning this vehicle but it is oddly similar to the new Honda Accord, which I also have.  Looks like a little industrial espionage by somebody.    "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Peppy, 05/07/2005,A fun to drive peppy car,5,"Having been owners of Mistubishi cars before and know how reliable they are and how long they last, we decided to get a new 2005 Galant LS.  Besides being an eye-catching car which has had many compliments, it is a smooth driving car, roomy, and with its airbags both front and side and a heavy body, it is a safe car.  Mitsubishi warranty is fantastic -- 10 years - 3 years of normal routine services (oil, change, rotate tires, etc.).  For someone looking for a stylish car that lasts, no one would be disappointed with the Mitsubishi Galants. "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Dan, 05/19/2005,Best Mid-Size Car Out There,4,"This Car is awesome.  It has a beautiful exterior, very sporty looking.  The interior is very attractive with titanium trim and 6 speaker infinity sound system. The alloy wheels are worth the extra money since the generic wheel covers are ugly. The upgrades are nice but are a little more expensive than they should be. I recommend this car to anyone looking for a quality, sexy, and sporty sedan.  The 2.4L engine is awesome and it doesn't make much noise.  The car is very sturdy and I feel very safe inside of it.  Also comes with the best warranty in the business, 10yr / 100,000, 5 yr / 60,000 bumper to bumper, 3 yr free maintence. Mitsubishi has a winner with the 2005 Galant!"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Clint Riley, 07/12/2005,Great Car,4,"I just recently purchased this car and I love it. I love the handling and its look. It is very comfortable and reliable. It is very spacious also. The acceleration is moderate, but I didnt buy a DE for the acceleration. The engine feels powerful and the transmission is smooth. I would recommend this car to anyone."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,HeidiB, 07/12/2005,"SE Galant 20005, A great purchase!",5,"I simply can't say enough good things about the SE model. The spoiler, exhaust, leather interior, rims and taillight upgrades are phenomenal. I enjoy the space and roominess of the vehicle and how luxurious it is for the price I purchased it for. It's a great change of pace from it's rather plain-jane competitors (Accord and Camry). Wish this vehicle was publicized the way those are, and the warranty is a huge reason to make this your car! I don't worry about it expiring prior to my loan being paid off. Additionally, can you beat 0% financing?"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,ray, 07/16/2005,the best car for the price,5,"The 2005 Mitsubishi Galant is great.  It has excellent looks, is macho, fast, economical, a great stereo, quiet interior, and last but not least great price and is maintenance free with a great warranty."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Tommy, 07/19/2005,Happy overall,4,"I can fit all three car seats in the back and still have room in between to buckle the buckels, and still can shut the doors with out hitting or bumping any of the car seats.  It gets up and goes when you need to get out of the way of anything.  Great gas mileage when you are traveling...but not around town. It is very sturdy and feels safe. The sensor for the airbag in the passager seat is great, since I do have little ones that sometimes have to sit in that seat.  "
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Happy Driver, 07/28/2005,Love my Black Beauty GTS!,4,"I've only had it a month, but this is a great car--looks beautiful,and the quality for the price is excellent. It sure can fly when I tell it to, unlike my last car, which thought about it for a while! It is so comfortable, and has even made driving to work a joy! I intend to take it out on the open road while I am on vacation and really drive it. Our son had a Galant ('01) until recently, and it was a super little car, too, which steered me toward getting this one. Only 2 things I don't like: 1)The driver's a/c vent is angled kind of strangely, so it doesn't blow on you like it should; and 2)t he sunglasses/garage opener holder is very stiff--ladies, it will break your nails!  This car is the best."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Mikey He Likes It!!!, 03/16/2006,Very Impressive.,5,"What can I say? For a great price, you get a great car. I am averaging about 26 mpg. The interior is very quiet. The ride is soft. It feels like an Acura drive. The car is a little sluggish though due to it's heavier than average weight. It does pick up after about 18 mph. I highly reccomend this car to anyone looking for a Camry or Accord. The price is a heck of a lot better for what ya get."
mitsubishi,galant,2005,kungfubaby, 07/18/2006,Great Car!,5,"What can I say - I love my Galant!  The first day that I drove it, it felt like I was driving a luxury car (I was so accustomed to driving a compact car before).  It is a comfortable drive and I like the fact that it has received high safety ratings.  I look forward to driving my Galant for a long, long time!"
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Zulma Munoz, 07/28/2006,Fun to Drive,4,This car saved my life.  I loved it and I'm looking to purchase another just like it.  I would recommend it 100 times over.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,JUSTIN WASHINGTON, 10/12/2006,I LOVE IT,5,I love my Galant.  The experience was wonderful when I purchased it.  The interior is sporty as well as the outside.  This is by far the best quality car I've had.
mitsubishi,galant,2005,Athens24, 02/10/2016,Reliable.,5,"I purchased my 2005 Galant with 27,000 miles in 2009 and must say this has bee my most reliable car I have ever owned. I recently traded in my 2005 and upgraded to the SE model, which is the fully loaded version and the last year( 2012) the Galant was made. I wish American cars were this reliable.

I purchased it New in 2005.

mitsubishi,galant,2005,Tokunboh Abayomi Owolabi , 09/13/2020,Best car so far!,5,"I have been using this car for the past four years now in Nigeria, I have no problem whatsoever with any of the parts, except that I had to change the suspension due to the bad roads we have in Nigeria. 
So far, this car is short of nothing, it's just perfect in shape, size, mechanical, electrical etc
The A/C is perfect, the lighting is superb, spacious trunk. 
What a perfect car!!!

mitsubishi,galant,2006,Matt L., 07/31/2006,Don't Overlook This Car,4,"I don't see many of them on the road.  The Galant is very under appreciated.  It is every bit as good, and in some cases better than an Altima, Camry, or Accord.  I think it looks better too, with an edgy, more modern styling, especially with the SE tail lights and spoiler.  This car looks smaller on the outside than it really is on the inside.  I'm 6'4"" and I have plenty of head room and leg room.  The interior has a very clean, modern look and the blue lighting is unique.  The hidden radio controls on the back side of the steering wheel keep everything looking neat and uncluttered.  Its four cylinder engine has more than enough power to move this car.  I'm getting 25 mpg in town, over 30 mph highway."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Josh, 05/22/2008,Awesome Car,4,"The Galant is a very under-rated sedan. It handles great, even with the 4 cyl. has plenty of power when needed and can get great gas mileage. It handles very well and looks awesome. It is very unique, not many people drive them. Despite its EPA rating being lower than other sedans, I still manage to get 25-26 mpg by driving it in town. The Galant is an awesome car. Even after two and a half years it feels new. The resale value isn't very good, but that does mean a used one would be a lot cheaper than a new one and still a great ride."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,AdamG, 05/04/2006,Awesome Car,5,"I purchased this car in Feb. of 2006.  I also got the protection options on it.  I love this machine.  It handles great, with tremendous acceleration, and outstanding options.  The car has tremendous room, agile handling, and the blue lights inside make this vehicle very sharp.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  The sound system works great even with my satellite readio hooked up to it.  The only suggestion would be to have dual power seats up front and back seats that lay down.  This is an excellent car to drive and own overall.  Great job to the employess that came up with this awesome car.  To answer the guy's comment on 2/1/06 it does come with heated mirrors on the exterior."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,dscarchick, 10/17/2013,Great car for the price,5,"I bought my used Galant 6 months ago and so far its been the most reliable car I've owned. It's the first import I've owned as well. Very comfortable to drive and I get 29 mpg with the 6 cylinder engine. Granted, it isn't a German luxury car but if your looking for an affordable used car with a good reputation, this is it. I like it so much in fact, i'm going to buy a 2012 model when my financial situation improves. I was bummed to hear 2012 was the last year but who knows, maybe Mitsubishi will make a new full size car with similar features. Overall, a good buy."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Joe & Nayra, 08/29/2010,Galant Lover,5,"This is the second Galant we've owned. The first one was a 2003 model. We bought it used with 140,000 miles on it and it drove very good for three years. With that type of dependability we decided to go for another one. The 2006 model we just bought has 60,000 miles on it but drives great and it looks like new inside out!"
mitsubishi,galant,2006,n ancy, 05/17/2008,Back slip problem,4,"This is my second Galant 1st was 2003 just purchased 2006. Love the improvements made to the newer model, but my 2006 backslips when on an incline. Brought back to the dealer and was told thats just how the car is and it was because the rpm weren't as high as the 2003 model."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Ohio Owner, 01/03/2008,GTS Fan,5,"Really like this GTS model-fun to drive, smooth ride after some new tires were put on and handles great for a sedan. Interior is put together well and very comfortable-best Mitsu I've had."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,T. Miller, 10/27/2005,Solid Sedan,4,"So far I have put 8,500 miles on my 2006 Mitsubishi Galant GTS V6 and have had not problems.  It gives great, responsive power and has a nice balance of comfort and road feel.  It is the roomiest vehicle in its class, comes with a solid warranty, and an outstanding sound system.  Its handling is a good balance between comfort vs. road feel, thought the car is not meant to be pushed to hard (it's a sedan - doesn't take to sliding around corners well!).  The abundance of torque and power make it a very comfortable car to be driven, it's hard to keep below 80 mph.  Its clear guages, and autoshift provide some additional ""enthusiast"" feel.  This is a very pleasant, reliable car - I look forward to driving it each day.  What more can you ask?"
mitsubishi,galant,2006,jkbolson, 12/26/2005,Great Alternative to Keeping up with the Jones',4,The 2006 Mitsubishi Galant ES is a really a great vehicle.

mitsubishi,galant,2006,JDeauseault, 06/15/2006,Excellent 4 Door Sport Sedan,4,"My driving experience has been excellent: good road feel, firm, not stiff or jarring ride. I would and will buy Mitsubishi vehicles from now on due to this being my 4th purchased from the manufacturer. All have had the same qualities: excellent fit and finish, above average powertrains with power and efficiency, outstanding, unique styling (many compliments from friends and strangers alike)."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Anna L, 07/19/2006,Glad I Found This Car!,5,"I bought my car after trading in my horrific '05 Toyota Highlander.  I was sure I was going to buy either a Ford Fusion or Honda Accord (never another Toyota). There happened to be a Mitsubishi dealer next to the Honda dealer, so I stopped in.  I immediately fell in love with the looks of the Galant SE.  I test drove it and also loved the comfort, handling, acceleration, and quality/design of the interior.  It's very sporty compared to the Accord, and is every bit as good in quality.  Also, it's union made in the US by the UAW.  This is important to our family.  This car has top notch safety and reliability records, and the longest warranty in the market. The Fusion's made in Mexico and wasn't as nice."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,sirvince, 11/18/2012,Great value for my buck,4,"I just changed jobs and had to give up my company car sooner then I thought and bought this car without even test driving it from a dealer. I just had a good feeling about the car..Now that I own it I just love it.. Even with the 98,000 miles on it I could tell it was well cared for. Not even one door dig on it so I know the last person watched were they parked it to avoid door digs. Why would someone do all that and not care for the car..Right? I was sad to hear that this car will be dropped after 2012. Just when I find a car I like it's discontinued. Sure a Honda or Toyota is a higher rated car but also a higher price..In these hard times the Galant offered me great value for my dollar"
mitsubishi,galant,2006,DeeDee, 11/29/2005,2006 Mitsubishi Galant ES,4,"I have not had any problems with my 2006 Mitsubishi Galant ES so far.  It idles a little low for my tastes, at about 500 rpm though.  750 rpm would ""feel"" more stable.  Also, it will not take you long to dislike the silver trim around the radio/heater console.  It shows a very bad reflection in your windshield.  It seems like I constantly am staring at this reflection in my windshield, does anyone else notice this?"
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Myprotoge, 01/04/2006,My First Mitsubishi,4,"This is my first Mitsubishi vehicle.  So far I must say, I am very pleased with my 2006 Galant.

The ride is awesome, it corners well, and handle bumps effortlessly.  "

mitsubishi,galant,2006,Gary T., 02/21/2006,One Fine Sedan,4,"A week ago I purchased a 2006 Galant GTS V6 and I am loving every minute I'm in it. I have only tallied 400 miles in it so far, but I am highly impressed.  It has fast acceleration, quick turning, holds the road through curves, and turns like shes on rails. There is plently of room inside to give four adults plenty of room. A few improvents that I would suggest would be to heat the exterior mirrors and upgrade the interior rear mirror with the autodimming feature that it available on Mitsubishi's higher end SUV's.  Also, the passager side seat needs to be upgraded to a high-end power seat.  Overall this is a very reliable and  enjoyable car to drive."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Jason Bittner, 05/11/2009,I Purchased Used,4,"I purchased this car used. It was a one owner lease and well taken care of. I never anticipated buying a Galant. I was in the market for a Camry or Accord. The value of this vehicle is great. I bought a 4 year old car with a warranty, Honda or Toyota couldn't come close.  I have now owned this car for one week and absolutely love driving it. "
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Miss Penny, 01/17/2010,I am Queen of the Road,5,I love my Galant!  It chose me at the dealership-I didn't choose it.  I didn't even test drive it--I simple drove it away and you have been unable to catch me ever since.  It handles great and I haven't had any problems at all with it.  It is very fast (or maybe that's just me)  I got a lot of bang for a little buck.  Used with 22000 miles it was practically brand new.  I'll never give it up!
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Lwilliams, 10/20/2006,Sexy Red Galant,4,"I purchased a 2006 Black Mitsubishi Galant ES in January.  The car was very nice but was lacking something. One month after I purchased the 2006 Galant ES, Mitsubishi introduced the 2006 Special Edition Galant.  A beautiful car, everything I wanted in the Galant: style, substance, and leather seats. The SE was the type of car I was supposed to have, so I got.  Love every minute of it."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Maxim Baddy, 03/14/2018,Wallet Deathtrap,3,"This car is horrendous. Parts to replace common things such as Exhaust Manifold, Radiator Senors, the Radiator itself, Water Pump, etc. They all cost an arm & leg. Mitsubishi needs to start taking notes from Toyota. Galants are terrible.

mitsubishi,galant,2006,Motherof two, 01/23/2006,Good Car for the Money,4,"I looked at the Galant on a whim, while passing a dealer.  I test drove the car and it felt very comfortable. I liked the style and the size (I did not want something too small)  So far I am happy with it.  I think it far exceeds the handling of the Honda Accord I test drove and is much more comfortable.  I have not had any ""glare"" from the metal plate near the radio!  I don't know what all the hype is about that.  The only thing it needs is a lighted shift console.   Other than that I have no complaints yet!"
mitsubishi,galant,2006,½mv², 03/24/2006,A little bit of everything...,3,"I bought the car without ever test driving it - I didn't even like the way it looked.  I used to own an Avalon XLS, which was the biggest and baddest luxury car I had ever seen.  I also owned a 1993 twin turbo RX7, which outran and outhandled everything but the Corvette Z06.  In February '06 I got in a crash that cost me both cars.  I needed a car quick, and I didn't have time to shop around so I looked for the best deal I could get on a reliable ride.  I've had the car for less than a week and I already love it.  The car glides along highways and satifies the desire for a luxury-car-feeling, yet locks down tight onto the road when you get the burning desire to rip around a 90 degree turn at 30 mph."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,vm, 06/03/2006,Great buy,4,I love the way this car handles. I needed a car that was more gas friendly for my job and am very satisfied. I have had Mitsubishi cars for 12 years and have never been disappointed.
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Eric M, 04/15/2006,Driven To Thrill!,4,"I purchased the car a few weeks ago, after checking out many others, it was between this and the Honda Civic LX sedan.  I went with the Galant because I liked the exterior look better, it felt more solid on the road, its acceleration is better, and the warranty is awesome.  It's been a thrill to drive so far!  One minor problem is the glove box does not close quite flush on the left side and the service manager is telling me it's normal. Of the twenty other various trims on the lot, not one is as out of whack as mine. I'll see if the GSM takes care of it, and I won't die if they don't, but expect better on a $20,000 car. Also, the silver console does reflect in the windshield, but it does not bother or distract me. "

mitsubishi,galant,2006,frank Sabia, 09/06/2006,2006 Mitsubishi Galant,5,This is my fourth Galant and this is the best of them all.  I like the interior with the information center.  The exterior is very nice as well.  I really like the tail lights.

mitsubishi,galant,2006,Mike Smith, 09/26/2006,A Great Buy,4,This is my second Galant and I really like the improvements over the 2001 model.  The seating is more comfortable and the car has lots of power for a 4-cylinder.  The controls are well placed and convenient.  The bold Mitsubishi design is a welcome change from the mediocre designs of the competition.  
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Gerald Zymet, 10/01/2006,A Very Decent Automobile!,4,"This was my second purchase of a Mitsubishi Galant GTS and probably my last.  Mitsubishi has poor quality control as both vehicles had major factory defects at under 1,000 miles.  The car does handle and drive very well, though the engine does give you some wallop when you accelerate."
mitsubishi,galant,2006,Kaarst, 05/29/2008,"Quick, sporty, more bang for your buck.",4,"I bought this car with 3,000 test drive miles on it. It was brand new. Almost a year later - it still drives like new. Quick off the line, quick stops, it hugs the road through cornering. It has the look and feel of a European driving machine. ""Poor man's BMW"" is what I call it."

mitsubishi,galant,2007,TripleKings, 12/28/2006,My Mitsubishi Galant,4,"I have driven the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Corolla, as well as the Nissan Altima.  For the overall driving experience/price/service my Mitsubishi Galant wins.  I recently traded a 2004 for a new 2007 model and I could not be any happier.  I never had any problems with the 2004, I just wanted a new vehicle.  It has plenty of room, runs smooth and fast, and gets good gas mileage.  It is all about the money and for the money - well go drive one for yourself and see."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Vinny, 09/22/2006,Very Good Car,4,"I previously had an '06 Galant GTS, but traded up because of the interior and exterior improvements.  The use of the mivec V6 from the Eclipse makes the car much smoother and more responsive than the previous 230hp V6.  The 5-speed automatic transmission makes slightly sharper shifts and has improved my gas mileage.  Probably the most notable improvement is the interior fit in finish, nothin' shakes or is lose, and the car is much quieter on the rode.  I opted for the navigation system which is much better than in the Accord and Maxima.  The Rockford Fosgate sound system is one of the best on the market.  Lastly, the suspension provides a better feel around the corners than the previous generation's did."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,RJB, 10/08/2006,Good So Far,4,This maybe one of the most fun cars I have ever driven.  I have had two Mercedes and they were not as much fun as my Ralliart.  It is a very nice car!
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Ron Eberhart, 10/26/2006,Love This Car,5,"This is my first Mitsubishi...and I love the way it rides and handles.  The 160 HP 4-cylinder engine is very peppy.  I bought it instead of the ""6"" for better fuel economy.  I'm getting about 22 - 23 MPG in mostly city driving.  It is very roomy inside.  The back seat has a lot of leg room.  It has air bags everywhere. Plus it has a 5 star front and side impact rating from the government.  I like that.  Try it, you'll like it."

It has a BMW-like feel and plenty of room, like a nice sized sedan.  It is still very new, so I have to break it in. Its engine was a bit noisy at first iat slow speeds. I love the visibility and ride."

Even though this is my first new car ever, I work in the auto industry and have seen, driven and sold many different vehicles. The 2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart is one of the best mid-size sport sedans. I think the gas mileage could be a little better, but then again that's coming from someone who is used to driving a 4 cylinder."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Mitsubishi PrOpHeT, 06/26/2008,I love this car!,5,"I've been driving Galants ever since I first started driving and this is the best one yet! My first car was a '95 Galant, my second one was a '00, and now I currently drive the '07. All in all, I can honestly say that this is a GREAT car. PERIOD! Probably will be the only type of car I will ever drive (unless I hit the lottery or something, lol!) I get great gas mileage, handling is pretty good, it looks sharp, and rides very smooth. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Before I purchased my car, I test drove the Dodge Avenger, the Nissan Altima, and the Chevy Impala, looking for something different, and none of these other vehicles, in my opinion, could come close to the Galant."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Help, 08/06/2008,Poor Paint Job,2,"I bought this car in Oct. 2007 just before the winter.  I noticed what looked like salt in front of the rear tires.  When spring came and i washed the car, i noticed it was actually paint that was missing.  The dealership contacted mitsubishi and submitted photos.  They said it was due to ""road wear"" so they would not repaint my car even though it was only 6 months old.  Shouldn't they use paint on their cars that can stand up to road wear?  I have filed a complaint with the review board but haven't heard back yet.  When i see another Galant in a parking lot, i always look and there is the same problem to some degree in the same place.  I haven't owned the car for a year and it is rusting"
mitsubishi,galant,2007,lreimer, 06/16/2011,Still the BEST,5,"Think I wrote shortly after my purchase - have now owned the car 3.5 yrs and have 40,000 on it. Speaking from experience the Ralliart is simply THE BEST - better than Mercedes or BMW - much more fun to drive. I get 18MPG City and 28MPG Hiway. Everything just ""feels"" right. Had an 07 Eclipse Spyder 6-spd before this - and SAME comments. Only reason I traded it was top ""slit"" twice in Miami Parking. A ""tip"" for Ralliart Owners - the engine runs FINE on ""Regular"" - Mitsu says ""Premium RECOMMENDED"" - but 3.8 V6 still perfect on Regular - one SWEET engine! One SWEET car!!!
A real KEEPER - and a REAL ""Sleeper"" !! Only about 2500 total made during 07-09 Model run."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Arlene Coleman, 11/14/2006,Wonderful Car,5,I love driving this car.  It has enough room to carry adults in the back seat. Plus it has a beautiful interior. It corners like a dream. I recommend this car to any body.  You can't beat the quality for the price. It even has a great warranty and after sales service.
mitsubishi,galant,2007,bbod78, 03/31/2012,2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart is expensive to maintain,3,"I purchased my 2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart as a second owner when the vehicle only had 11,000 miles on it. The car is amazingly fun to drive with excellent acceleration and handling, it is also amazingly expensive to maintain. The parts and labor associated with fixing this vehicle are out of control and difficult to locate. The gas mileage is unacceptable for today's gas prices (I average about 16 MPG city/22 MPG highway, non-aggressive driving). The tires, too, that come standard with this car cost nearly $200 a tire and last only approximately 30,000 miles. Frequently stores don't even have the tires in stock and have to special order them! This car was too much of an expensive."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,henry, 08/26/2006,Henry's Gallant GTS Review,4,I puchased a Gallant GTS back in April and the most impressive feature about it is its power. The Gallant does exactly what you want it to do. It has no problem speeding up onto the freeway when you need it to. The engine has a very nice roar when acceleraating.
mitsubishi,galant,2007,canadamorris, 01/29/2012,What a great car!,4,"I have owned the Galant for a little more than three weeks, and already I love it! It's great inside, has a lot of power for a four cylinder, and handles nicely. I got this car for a much better price than I could have an Accord or Camry, and boy am I glad I did! I'm a big guy, so it's hard to find a car that I can fit into, but this fits me like a glove! I also love the blue backlights on the dash and radio. I also really like the high crash ratings. I really don't understand the one negative review on the car, since the Galant is an absolute dream to drive! I would highly recommend this (or any Mitsubishi) to one of my friends, or practically anyone looking for a good, fun, car!"
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Mjkj, 06/03/2008,Absolute Favorite,5,"I purchased this car about 5 days ago after reading numerous reviews and having a friend who currently owns one. I have it say it is great car. I also have a 06' Dodge Stratus that is horrible on gas and bucks on the road when you pass the second gear, so this is a great step up!"
mitsubishi,galant,2007,MitsuMan, 04/14/2009,'07 Ralliart Joyride,4,"Bought my '07 Ralliart used with 13k miles. Still own a '97 Galant ES with 161k on it (awesome reliability). Have to say, I am absolutely blown away with the Ralliart; it's the most fun I've ever had driving. This car just begs to get out and run in the left lane. Cruises along smooth as silk at 40, 60, 80 MPH. Interior is immaculate and I love the leather and the high quality feel of the dash pieces. Everything about the car just feels right. From the way it drives to the way it looks to the solid, high-quality feel of the controls, seats, and movable parts.  Overall, this has to be the best car you never really hear much about. Buy one and you will not be disappointed."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,savingchris19, 03/04/2008,I Recommend It!!,4,"I just bought the brand new 07 Galant ES with the sport package. Seems like it runs great so far, fun to drive, has a good amount of power for a 4 cyl., the dash lights look amazing at night! 360 watt rockford sound system sounds excellent. I had an 03 lancer before I got this car. This car is wayyy better than that was. Only thing wrong with the galant is the disc changer, something is wrong with the number 2 cd slot, but the dealership is putting a new one in for me so its all good. Go get yourself one, I recommend it!"
mitsubishi,galant,2007,James Bozman, 10/11/2006,Love my galant,4,"Great vehicle, can't beat it. Very smooth ride and handling.  Would recomend to others."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,smogtek, 06/07/2007,Highly Overrated!,1,I can't help but wonder if these positive consumer reviews are being posted by mitsubishi dealers themselves. This car is a dog' A nightmare to park for a sedan! it's as wide as a truck or a van with huge blind spots at the rear flanks. Important controls that would be regularly adjusted on a road trip are not illuminated at night. The front windshield has a nasty glare reflecting the chrome accents from the dashboard (too many chrome accents)you need sunglasses to protect your eyes from interior glare. I test drove this car at night or I would have caught this major design flaw and passed. The majority of interior space in this car is all in the rear seating area. Cannot recommend this car!
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Dionnie, 06/15/2008,Love this car,4,This is by far the best car I've purchased. It handles very well. Lots of muscle and speed. The Sunset Pearlescent color turns a lot of heads. I'm keeping this one. 
mitsubishi,galant,2007,mithun2005, 06/08/2010,Quality and fun for bargain price,4,"I purchased this car in early 2009. Although dealer said it was one owner, I did not check anything officially (carfax etc). It is at 30,000 miles now from 12,000.  Not a single problem so far. Fun to ride. Excellent handling. great exterior look of SE compare to other Galant models. Excellent sound of upgraded audio system. First Galant for me, third in my family. Nothing else can beat the value of this car."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,michellemarie, 08/19/2010,Great value for the price,5,I traded a 2002 Audi A6 for my Galant and was hesitant at first.  After owning the car for awhile I realized that the value for the dollar cannot be beat.  It has all the comfort and driveblility I could ask for but is so reasonable to drive.  Low maintenance cost and high trade in value make it an amazing car for the money.
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Samantha, 09/26/2010,Love it!,5,"I bought this car used with 500 miles on it.  Am at 60k now and still enjoy this car.  Love the features, heated leather seats, navi, sunroof, and rockford fosgate sound system. This car is reliable. I only have to take it to Mitsubishi for oil changes. It is roomy and comfortable on long trips.  Gas mileage is decent. Love, love, love the horsepower! What a great car at a great price.  I traded my Volkswagen Passat for this car and glad I did."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Tinia, 10/20/2006,Loving It!,4,"I have never purchased a Mitsubishi before because I thought I was in love with Toyota.  Based on Edmunds reviews and more importantly, consumer reviews, I decided to give the Gallant a try.  The sticker price was excellent compared to Toyota and Honda and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I had no intention on purchasing an '07 model but with the rebate and other offers, I could not resist. I am a LARGE woman and I can get in and out of the car with NO problems.  The performance is great on the road and I love the way people stare!"
mitsubishi,galant,2007,mark mitsubishi, 01/06/2007,"Just Bought It on 1-5-07, Very Happy",5,"I have only have had my Galant for little more than a day.  I previously owned an '03 Galant and an '03 Eclipse. Those were very good cars, but Now! WOW!  The 2007 Galant is a great deal more refined especially and it has more rear passenger room and better styling than say the '04 model.  I'm lovin' it. Betcha heard that one before."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,galantbylisa, 09/12/2011,Wow!!! I never thought I would be this happy with car!,5,"I saw the one negative review on here about the glare of the interior and the blind spots in the rear flanks and how it is difficult to park.. and all I have to say is LOL!
I am IN LOVE with this car and I NEVER thought I would ever write a positive review for a car in my life, but the Galant has driven me to it (no pun intended)!

Yes, there are blind spots in the back (I have yet to drive a vehicle that does not have blind spots), and I have NO idea what he is talking about as far as the glare goes.
The u-turns are a little more wider than say a Toyota Corolla (a car I currently still have), but not at all difficult for parking (unless you don't know how to park).
HIGHLY recommended!"
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Eric, 04/22/2007,Great car with few problems,4,"I've only had this car for 3 days but love it. Plenty of room all around, including ample trunk space. The engine is very responsive and can push you back against your seat when you want it and it has a great throaty hum from 2K RPM and up. It looks great from the outside but it is truly gorgeous on the inside. The Rockford Fosgate system is an awe and you will blow out your eardrums way before you it becomes distorted. The sport suspension lets you hug the road around turns but still offers a comfortable ride. All around a truly functional car that can still make your adrenaline pump when you want it to."
mitsubishi,galant,2007,galant07, 05/30/2007,2007 Mitsubishi Galant,4,"This car is a bargain with a capital ""B"". I got mine with the sport package (alloy wheels, Rockford stereo w/changer and steering wheel controls, Sirius, spoiler and upgraded lights, security system). Handling is regarded as the best of the mid-sizers and the seats and legroom are fantastic (and I'm 6'3""). Another 20 hp would be nice, but hey, I'm getting 27 mpg with a city/hwy mix and it's peppy enough for most driving. The stereo is just unbelievable and the manual shift mode is f-u-n. "
mitsubishi,galant,2007,milos, 06/22/2007,2007 Mitsubishi Galant,5,"I just bought this car and I love it. Easy to drive, feels sporty, stable on the road, easy on gas. Mitsubishi is big in Europe and underappreciated in USA. Excellent warranty and real eye pleaser. Looks like a BMW, drives like an Accord, costs like a Chevy!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2007,Harrisburg Driver, 08/15/2007,Excellent Car,4,"I had a 2003 Gallant that ran beautifully for years, and this car is a significant upgrade from that one.  If the reliability and durability is as good, I will be extremely happy with this purchase."
mitsubishi,galant,2008,bosox1001, 03/24/2012,"Great car, great value",4,"I purchased mine with about 42k miles on it and a year later have it approaching 61k. It's a great car that is both practical for commuting AND fun to drive! As far as value within class, it blows away anything Honda can offer. Don't be fooled by it only being a 4 cylinder 4 speed automatic and think it has a weak engine. It gets a surprising amount of power for it's engine size, but since it's not a 3L V6, it gets very respectable gas mileage. Plus the tank is huge, I can get around 420+ miles per tank. The trunk is also HUGE, as I do a lot of tailgating and it can fit multiple fold-up tables, grills, wood, coolers, with room to spare.

Overall, it's a very great value."
mitsubishi,galant,2008,Happy Mitsu Customer, 10/03/2008,An Awesome Car!,5,"The 2008 Mitsubishi Gallant Ralliart is so much more car than I ever expected. Looked at Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, VW Passat and Mazda 6 and this car blows them all away. The navigation system is awesome and the stereo is one of the best I have ever heard! Not to mention this car is FAST!"
mitsubishi,galant,2008,lovemycar, 06/29/2010,Consumer Ratings have more value,5,"I love my Galant. It's stylish, nice looking interior. Great on gas. Had it for over 2 years now and still love driving it! I usually get sick of cars quickly, not this one, not yet anyway. "
mitsubishi,galant,2008,jtho249, 09/27/2011,never fails,4,"I have had my Galant for over two years and 40,000 miles. I've taken it on long trips and I obviously drive it every day. it is easy to drive. I have not had one issue mechanically. don't get the seats wet. the cloth they used will show a ring just from water. I have had to steam clean the seats to get the marks out. this car looks good and I will always recommend it to friends. as in most cases. treat your car well and it will treat you well."
mitsubishi,galant,2008,A King, 07/26/2008,Oh yeah,4,"I purchased this vehicle 2 days ago. I love it. It's a smooth drive and good on gas. It looks great too! I had my 3 nieces in the back seat; they weren't cramped (ages 18,14 and 9."
mitsubishi,galant,2008,rrivera, 08/12/2008,Great ride!,4,I'm so happy I bought this car. It has been an awesome driving experience. And not to mention the saving in y monthly fuel. I give two thumbs up.
mitsubishi,galant,2008,master, 05/12/2009,The Best,4,"One of the best cars driven in the mid luxury car segment. Ample leg room, good 4 side visibility. Stable. "
mitsubishi,galant,2008,jinsan, 12/01/2009,Hope it lasts as long as my Explorer!,4,"I recently purchased my '08 Galant with 30k miles and have now put 2k on it.  I just hope that it lasts as long as my '02 Explorer (152k trouble free miles).  I drive 20k miles per year, mostly commuting to work and 95% highway.  So far, I must say that this car rides and handles well...has plenty of power and is VERY quiet!  I am pleasantly surprised with Mitsu's build quality and hope to drive this car for 150k+ miles!  Waiting to see how it handles in the snow!!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2008,Jerry, 07/15/2009,Love my Galant,4,"Looked at the competition and felt the quality and pricing on this beauty was fair. I bought a nice base model and had leather seats installed. Still feel great tooling around in my Mitsubishi. It's a sporty, yet sensible commuter family sedan. Getting about 27 mpg avg. AC good, roomy interior, quiet ride. Have had a couple of trim retainers pop loose but not an issue."
mitsubishi,galant,2008,William Hernandez, 11/18/2007,Just Right,5,Engine perfomance is great.  I have ES model with a 2.4 and it has plenty of guts. Its smoothness on the road makes you forget how fast you may be driving. This cost me a speeding ticket the first week I bought the car.  I started using the steering wheel mounted cruise control feature to avoid any more tickets.  It handles steady and well around curves.  The 4 speed Sportstronic transmission gives me the option to change to a clutchless shifting mode for either a fast take off when necessary or to avoid heating breaks on down hills. I have many compliments from friends on its appearance.  To say the least it has a conservative and elegant but yet sporty look.  Perfect for my age bracket.
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Mngoodtimes, 12/02/2010,Superb Value,4,"Excellent acceleration for a 4- banger.  Wish the MPG were a bit better, have been averaging 22 miles with combo driving.  It's been freezing here in MN so I'm hoping the MPG will tick up a bit in the spring/summer.   Drivers seat is very comfortable and has great leg room (I'm 6'1, 220 lbs).  Rear leg room space is great but the seats are a bit low.  My 10 yr old has starting using her booster seat again in order to see out the window better.  Purchased new, the 2009 Galant ES was $22K.  I purchased mine a couple weeks ago with 49k miles for $9991...not too shabby!!!"
mitsubishi,galant,2009,sumncguy, 04/30/2013,Mitsubishi is a good option,4,"We bought our Gallant new in 2008 and have over 130k trouble free miles on it. NO. Let me say this again NO Major problems with this car. We simply do the planned maintenance. One downside is with the wrong tires, the car is loud. Alot of interior noise. Something just started rattling around in the trunk area .. sounds like something body related. I had a mitsubishi engine in my 1999 Grand Voyager and we ran that to almost 300k. 2 FOR 2, Mitsubishi has been good to me. A great alternative to the overpriced Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans. "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,diesengine, 01/02/2012,Overall a decent car - Needs many small improvements,4,"Overall quite pleased. Car yields about 25 mpg in 90% city, 10% highway driving. Like the sound of the engine when accelerating. Not that many on the road so it stands out with its sporty styling. Random noises occasionally come from the cabin. Can hear sound of gas sloshing around in back when filled full. Rear was redesigned in 2009 which looks somewhat like Lexus IS although with larger tail lights. Also added for 2009 was 4-wheel ABS, Tire pressure monitor, shiftable transmission and daytime running lights. The car sits lower to the ground than other midsize sedans and is more fun to drive than just about all except for the Mazda6. Has tight steering which lets you feel the road. "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Jamie in Las Vegas, 02/08/2010,Better than the reviews I've read,4,"I've had a 98 Jeep Wrangler for a decade. So moving to a sedan is an upgrade in most ways. Interior, styling, ride, acceleration; ALL are an improvement for me.  I know a Camry or Accord might be better outfitted, but so far, I'm digging it. It is at once distinctive AND doesn't call attention to itself. 2009 restyle fixes design incongruities from earlier models. 4 cyl engine does much better than I thought it would. I'm very pleased.  If you are moving from a lesser car you won't have many complaints. I test drove a 2010 Kia Optima before this one, and the 2009 Galant kicks its behind. But then, I guess it should. Love it right now. We'll see if I feel the same after 9 years."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,nick131, 06/13/2014,Very reliable vehicle,4,"Bought the car with 34k miles , now have 80k miles and still drives the same. The only maintenance performed have been oil changes and front brake pads once. Drives great on highways and passes other cars easily. Five speed speedtronic comes handy on snow days.
great car for everyday commuter. "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,John, 02/12/2008,Great job!,5,"Although Mitsubishi only made slight changes to the 2009 Galant, they seemed to pick the best features to improve.  The ride is smoother and quieter.  The new sport fabric seat is very comfortable and they even have power and 2-part heated fabric seats.  They did away with the cheap plastic console and it look very tastefully elegant.  A+ overall!"
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Laparry, 07/14/2016,Great Galant,5,"Extremely reasonably priced, about the best value for money out there. Very quick, reliable, responsive car which rides beautifully and just eats up the miles in comfort. V6 engine has all the power and ""get-up-and-go"" you need to get out of trouble.

mitsubishi,galant,2009,Rebekah T, 12/30/2017,Love My Car!,5,"I purchased my car when I was left with the engine computer going out of my Yota on the highway going 70+mpg in late 2009 when all the recalls were occurring. Safety and reliability are important for me...I took a huge loss as I had negative equity when I purchased that car and then again trading into my Galant.                                I’d say by far the Galant has been the best vehicle I’ve ever owned. It was made in my hometown state of IL.. and I’ve only had to do some minor maintenance on it and the factory tires.. are AMAZING! I’ve special ordered the tires three times from my local tire dealer because of how well they held up... and they are cheaper since they’re petroleum based. My Galant was purchased with SIX miles on it and I now have nearly 190,000! I’ve thought a couple times on trading into a SUV for my growing family but feel this car will continue to be reliable and safe for my family for a few more years! I commute to work daily (70 miles) and have taken 3 19+ hour trips and never once felt it would have any mechanical issues. Although my family feels it’s time to move on to something newer with less miles, I’m sticking to this Galant until it becomes too costly to repair issues.. I hope to see 300-400k miles out of it! Reliability: 5, Heavy Car With Peace Of Mind on any road conditions: 5, Roominess: 5, I absolutely LOVE my car.. not sure on the newer models but this one is a 5 star rating for me!

mitsubishi,galant,2009,Caddyboy117, 02/19/2019,Great deal!,4,"This car reliability wise has surprised me! Good car for the money. Interior is not an Accord or Camry and the Ralliart is not the best on gas but if you get a good deal, buy it!

mitsubishi,galant,2009,nick_ole, 03/26/2011,Could have been better,3,"I bought the base version of this car... It's very plastic, especially the trunk that sounds like a tin-can when you close it. 

Vehicle has lots of blind spots but for the money, it's still okay to drive. 

One morning, transmission started shifting heavy, took it to the dealer and after 2 days I find out that a squirrel had chewed off a wire that was supplying power to the onboard computer.. My question is, whey leave such an important cable exposed to the element through the vehicle design in the 1st place.

Most annoying issue was the squeal of the car when I reverse right after starting the vehicle. Dealer says is happens to all Gallants.

Just traded in..."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Placenshow, 11/26/2010,Superb Value,4,"Just purchased a used 2009 Galant ES with 49,xxx miles for $9991, brand new, this car was $22k! Traded in a 1999 Camry LE, which we loved, but were looking for a new model family sedan. So far so good. Plenty of space, decent acceleration for a 4 cylinder, and driver seat is quite comfortable. Doesn't have all the bells & whistles of Camry/Accord but pricing is a definite plus and reliability is above avg from what I've read on numerous sites. Looking forward to many happy years of worry free driving. "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Jetman, 07/03/2008,Nice little cruiser,4,"Overall the outer styling is top notch. The interior is nice but leaves room for improvement. The plastics are cheap and that cheapness is everywhere. The plastic scratches very very easily. My car has 4000 miles and looks like it has 50,000. It has only one 12 V adapter. Cup holders are way to far back, seat heater buttons are in a horrible location. The car runs and drives great with the 4cyl motor. This motor does take a bit to rev up but then the power kicks in. By no means is this car fast from the stop, if you want that get that Raliart model. I have already had the turn signal break and the rubber on the brake pedal fall off ( warranty items). The gas mileage is not that great in town."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Brett Gordon, 03/30/2009,I Love my Ralliart!,4,"The Galant Ralliart '09 is a very powerful and beautiful car; I love it. High points are acceleration, cruising power, sport leather seats, aluminum pedals, 20"" alum. alloy wheels, stereo system, GPS system with many additional (and helpful) applications. Low points include cheap plastic interior, VERY tight suspension system giving a bumpy (and noisy) ride, adjustable seat limitation set too high, rattling seat belt mechanism, over-sized tail lights, and the GPS DVD player in the trunk is set in a very poor location. However, the Pros far outweigh the Cons. As an all-around sport edition of a mid-size car, I'm very pleased with it, but hopefully, the 2010 will address the low points."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,funfolks, 06/04/2009,Fun Comfortable Reliable,4,This is our first Mitsubishi. It was a nice car at a great price at 0% financing. So far we are really enjoying it.
mitsubishi,galant,2009,GrandTurk, 09/21/2009,"Overall, Love It!",4,"I bought this car new one month ago and enjoy the ride to work everyday (city driving).  My 6'3"" tall but lean body build fits into the drivers seat with just enough headroom.  The ride is a tad noisy from the engine, particularly with the high rpm's upon acceleration, but not so much to be bothersome.  I don't care about the ""plastic"" interior comments from some of the reviewers.  I care more about the small side-view mirrors and wonder why nobody has mentioned this.  Also, the turning radius leaves a lot to be desired.  Why can't I turn into tight parking spots? The trunk is roomy.  The rear passenger space is roomy for a small car.  The good crash test performance gives you confidence."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,yubilo, 09/19/2009,Good contender,5,"This is my first Mitsu. Ive been driving it for about 2 months now in summer weather on both city and highway. Im combining about 25 MPG on 91 octane gas, which I think is great due to the elements. The car feels sturdy and 2.4 MIVEC engine picks up well on sportronic mode. It has a roomy interior and comfortable front and back seats. The controls are well laid out for easy access on the go. It comes with high performance all season tires which comes handy on the east coast changing seasons. This car is great buy! Everything sums up to a comfortable, reliable, spacious, sporty fun vehicle to drive. I would recommended this vehicle to a small to mid size family looking for a 4 door sedan. "

Have had this 2009 ES for one month and have put 2,000 miles on it so far. Not a problem, not a strange noise, nothing. Very nice car. Great styling. Nice to have something a little different than everyone else has. Nice ride, love that ABS is standard. Comfortable seats. Very roomy. Very pleased so far."

Not as refined as a Camry/Accord, but with rebate and deal, a far better value for the money.   However, I'll be bringing it back for third service to hunt down an intermittent engine noise.  Although disappointing on that one issue, it has been otherwise a good car (so far).  A comfortable fit for a tall person.  I purchase a car and drive it into it's grave. Camry's and Accords have gone the distance for me (10-15 reliable years).  I'm hoping the Gallant will go the same distance.   "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Brandon in Jersey, 05/19/2010,Impulse buy - turned out GREAT!,5,"I saw this car in the show room (black w/ black leather, 18's. )  gorgeous. Made my heart stop.  Sitting in it, I thought, ""I can't afford this"" . Killer sale, got it for like 22k and had them drive it out of the showroom.  So far, so good, been almost 13 months.  No problems, almost 14k miles.  I'm loving it.  Definitely a head-Turner.  Have not see others like mine on the road thus far!  Unsung hero. I think Mitsubishi has a lifer now.  Definitely would recommend!  "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,blb, 06/27/2010,SECRETS OUT - SMART MAN'S ACCORD!,5,"I've looked for over 4 months for a used mid-size car, I looked at 2008 Accord, I wasn't pleased with the road noise and the asking/selling price tag of $17,000+. My research began again, back to square one back to crash test ratings sites/edmunds.com and that's when I found the Galant. I liked how it drove more than the Accord and the price was over $8,000 less! Most used Galants for sale had been rental cars and with over 35,000 miles on them, but I kept looking and found some with less than 18,000 miles and for below $12,000! So I was sold! I couldnt be happier - I did my research and I have saved over $8,000.00! I may do an update review if Im still pleased with my poor/smart's Accord!:)"
mitsubishi,galant,2009,happykamper, 08/10/2010,Best car you might not know about,4,"I was reading all of these reviews and I wanted to agree with what everyone was saying. I have had this car for almost 2 years now. I bought it used with 17,000 miles. The reason why I purchased this vehicle was its low sticker price. I must admit I liked it from the beginning the 4 clyinder has power. The reliability is great all I have done is its recommended oil changes and that's it. Very roomy, let me tell you that's really important to me since I'm 6' 250 pounds! I live in Vegas and with all the driving through the snow on the mountains or the 100 plus degree temps. This vehicle has performed just great! I'm about to do my 60,000 mile service! Great buy and great reliability"
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Julie, 11/13/2010,I like my Galant,5,"I really like my 2009 Mitsubishi Galant. I have been driving it for a little over a month, and have no complaints. It had 29,000 miles on it when I bought, and now has 31,000 miles on it. I was driving a 1986 Lincoln town car, so it is a new experience. Other than feeling every little bump on the road, compared to the smooth ride of the Lincoln, it is a dream. The pick-up (acceleration) getting on the freeway is great, even before it's completely warmed up. The rear window defogger works pretty fast. The defrost works good, and the air-conditioning will freeze you out of there. The stereo system is good, with a nice cd player and radio, and the handling is good. I wouldn't trade it. "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,MikeMiko, 12/09/2018,Great car for the money,5,"Needed a car for work to commute into the city.  Purchased it used from a local mitsubishi dealer w 75,ooo miles.  Have owned many mitsubishi cars in the past and love this galant.  Shopped around for other cars honda/Nissan/Toyota, what I paid for the galant those other cars had double the miles.  Great car, heated and comfortable seats, stands out on the street, not like every other car that everybody's mother and grandma own.

mitsubishi,galant,2009,Angela Festini , 10/24/2019,I love my Mitsubishi,5,"I bought this 2009 galant used in 2011. 80000 miles at time of purchase.Paid 12 thousand dollars for it. I still have her now with 200000+miles. I drove this car all over America and she still runs amazing! And shes got balls too lol. I was told by many people 10 years ago if i kept up with the regular maintenance on this car it could run a long time. And they were right! So get regular oil changes, never let your gas get below a quarter tank. And dont be afraid to press down on that peddle. I know so many people who purposely he's in two speeding up because they think it's better for the car but every car I've owned I haven't drove it recklessly but I put my foot down when I'm trying to go and my cars of all lasted a really long time it ran great maybe it's my good luck maybe it's not I don't know. The only complained that I have about the car is that it is a very basic model meaning it only comes with a CD player and a radio no auxiliary and not too many features inside the car there's no keyless entry on mine.

mitsubishi,galant,2009,Chuck, 09/13/2009,It's just OK,3,"Mitsubishi did a good job on the rear end of the 09, but hardly did anything to the front. The Sports Edition that I have does have the chrome top to the grill and darkened headlights but that's it. Its ok on gas and ok on comfort. On a recent trip, my backside really got sore so I assume the seats could have been made better. I do not like the waffle like dash, I can already see where dust settles on it. When in idle, you can't turn the headlights off, like when you're waiting for someone. To me that's irritating. There is not an accessory adapter in the console like the prior years did. Engine is very noisy compared to my 08 Camry, and the doors sound tinny compared to the Camry."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,orotunds, 06/29/2008,Pleased as punch,4,"Having driven many different rental vehicles in the past two years, I had a good idea of what I wanted, and didn't want, in the vehicle I was buying. The 2009 Sports Galant from Mitsubishi motors is a great sedan with a moderate price. It reminds me of the Hyundai Azera but it costs several thousand dollars less. The 4 cylinder has good get up and go, and it accelerates quickly. The car handles well and the ride is very smooth. The car has a big trunk with the option of gaining more length by accessing the back seat interior. The car is the new canyon beige color and the exterior and interior is stylish. I am very satisfied with the car, and  would have paid even more for it if I had to"
mitsubishi,galant,2009,mRmill05, 07/20/2008,In time for 09!,5,"My wife and I are repeat offenders!  Just traded in our 04' for this new 09. Its a great buy, new body style, sporty shifter. The engine is more quiet.                  "
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Best Buy, 09/14/2008,Best buy in class,5,"I looked at the Camry because of styling, but after driving it I could feel the car felt more like a GM than a Toyota.  I then looked at the new Accord and was overall impressed with the car, except for the comfort of the vehicle and ease of access to the controls.  I even looked at Nissan which I said I'd never do again.  The plastic interior still needs major improvement.  Finally I figured I would look at the Mitsubishi Galant.  The sport edition pulled  me right in and for a 4 cylinder it has PLENTY pep.  The handling is great and the car is extremely comfortable.  Even the interior is top notch.  I love my Galant.  Toyota just lost another loyal customer and Mitsubishi gained a new one!"
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Kenneth, 11/29/2008,Mitsubishi wins again,4,"I just returned a Mitsubishi Galant ES '07 and was looking for a new car in or about the same price range. There really was no contest, Mitsubishi wins again. I purchased the 2009 Galant Sports edition 4 cylinder model. I am a big guy and have plenty of room anywhere in the car. The trunk space is huge. There are plenty of comfort features, heated leather seats, tire pressure. This model drives like a 6 cylinder and feels very sporty and has a comfortable sedan feel at the same time. The Galant is very reliable. For the money I feel this is a winner all the way."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Big Buse, 12/27/2008,Best Galant ever!,5,"The whole experience of the 2009 V6 sport is extraordinary! Extremely smooth ride, and when take off power is needed, it is definitely there! Very classy and luxurious look with its leather interior and sun/moon roof. Definitely puts my old 2007 to shame. Look out US and Euro competitors... you have a big problem on your hands."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,RocGalant, 01/08/2009,Happy so far,4,"I bought this car w/ 16mi. on the odo. And put just under 2k to so far. I really like the front grille and tail lights for 09. I'm about 6'1"" and it fits me perfectly. I had a 02 Eclipse and 00 Linc Continental. This Galant is perfectly wedged between those cars in terms of performance, ride quality, features, gas mileage and size. The Galant gets me from A to B with good sound from the 140w system, decent pep when passing hwys, great safety features."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Amanda, 03/01/2009,First new car,4,"After 3 used cars, the 09 Galant became my first new one and I love it! I came out of a 98 Galant and what a difference.  I've racked up over 12000 miles in 5 months so I have a good feel for all aspects of the car's performance.  I could nitpick and agree about the lower quality plastic interior and stuff, but that's not what I rely on to get me around town. The interior is driver friendly, spacious, and comfortable in any type climate.  It pulls well going up mountains, downshifts nicely in bad weather and has smooth acceleration.  I would wish for a few more horses on those short on ramps, but otherwise, it has plenty of get up and go."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,zjdewitz, 03/27/2009,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"Before I test drive my Galant, I had preconceived notions about the Mitsubishi brand. I'd always heard that they were unreliable, underpowered, and boring. But, once I put my foot on the gas, all of that flew out the window. The 2.4L has plenty of power, and has more pickup than my previous car, a 1999 Saab 9-3 turbo, even though it has less horsepower.  The Galant rides perfectly on the highway, with some wind noise that some of my other cars didn't have. But, it handles better than I could have expected. Braking, accelerating, and cruising are all top notch."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Victor, 04/27/2009,The car drives like a dream,5,The car drives like a dream. I cant think of anything that I don't like about this car - very sporty looking starting with the grill to the tail lights they look like the Lexus tail lights. As far as the engine - lots more power than the previous 4cyl plenty of power. I can't think of anything out there that can compare. Overall a very nice car for your money...
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Ralliart, 06/03/2009,Ralliart,4,Nice little sport tuned 4 door sedan.  Quick and responsive engine.  It possesses sporty exterior and interior look.  Very real on the streets.  Excellent car for your money and one of the best warranties for a sports car. 
mitsubishi,galant,2009,princmd, 07/26/2009,Value plus,4,"I just picked mine up today. After you factor price, 10 yr 100000 mile warranty, then Toyota, Nissan and Honda just don't  make sense. So far, I've enjoyed driving it around. It's comfy and the 4 cylinder feels as good as any on the market. If you are in the market for a comfortable, modestly priced, long term family vehicle, not another run of the mil ""Camry"" like the neighbors, then buy this car."
mitsubishi,galant,2009,Mitsu Believer, 10/29/2009,Best Bang for the Buck,4,"I am a car guy.  I bought the Ralliart used surprisingly.  It looks great, drives and is simply a rocket ship.  The Liquid Silver is a great paint and the wheels are nice.  Leather is comfortable.  The Navi is okay with accuracy but the features of the Navi and radio are terrific.  My wife even enjoys the ride of the car.  Winter is almost here and I'm curious to see how it handles snow.  I am averaging between 420-450 miles a fill up."

The other car makes were all test driven and some stood out more than others, like the Passat and Maxima sedans, and then my wife and I drove the 09 Gallant Ralliart. Well it rekindled our love for Mitsubishi with the build quality in the car plus the wonderful 258 horsepower 3.8 MIVEC engine and sport shift automatic transmission. All we can say is we recieved more for our money and fun for our dollar!"
mitsubishi,galant,2010,angel_ortega, 10/17/2011,Great Value for Price,4,"I must say that critic's review is harsh to say the least. I have recently purchased my 2010 Galant for $16K and am very much pleased with my purchase. I must say that the V6 option was a nice feature in the past but with gas prices where they are, I was in the market for a 4 cylinder anyhow. I researched the comparable Camry and Accord and the price margin was at least $3500. As someone that needs a daily commuter with great city and highway mileage (21 city and 30 hwy), the price difference helped with my purchase. Apart from great mileage, the car also has a torque happy 4 cylinder; helpful in lane-changing maneuvers, great cabin and trunk space, as well as, a great sound system."

mitsubishi,galant,2010,Chet Baker, 01/31/2010,Not Bad!,4,"I do agree with Edmunds regarding comparison with other vehicles in the 24K range, but let's put things into perspective... Mitsubishi is letting these cars go for about the same price that you would pay for a well equipped Civic! I was able to purchase the SE model for 18K. For the money, I know that a reliable, fun to drive, and not bad looking car was purchased. The warranty can't be beat. I do wish that the gas mileage was a little better, but it's not terrible."
mitsubishi,galant,2010,dan255, 09/25/2011,Great Value,4,"Edmunds review of this vehicle is REALLY harsh.
I test drove many other mid-sized sedans including the Camry, before I purchased my 2010 Galant.
A 2010 Camry with close to 20k miles on it would have cost me the same as the brand new 2010 Galant I purchased, with 12 miles.
I got a brand new 2010 left over Galant for just over 17k.
The sticker price is close to 23k for this vehicle.
You will not find a new Camry or Accord out there for anywhere close to this price.
For the price the Galant is a great value.
I would not pay 5k more for a Camry or Accord, I think the Galant is very close in quality after driving all of them."
mitsubishi,galant,2010,meeisdee, 06/07/2010,Nice Car,4,"This is my third Galant - I have owned a 1992, 2004 and now a 2010. I also own an Endeavour. To me, the Galant can not be beat. It looks good, drives good and is overall - reliable. My first car was topping 200K miles - 140K of which I put on myself. I never had ONE (not even one) major problem. The car was even rear-ended and held up beautifully with no injuries in the back seat. I am pleased with my new 2010 and hope to get as many miles out of this one as I have my others."

I must say I don't at all agree with the Edmunds OR Consumer Reports reviews. They seem exceedingly harsh. Although I would have preferred a 6 cyl the 4 cyl is quite adequate. Ok. It might not leap like a race car but it has a lot of pep for a 4 cyl. Handling and response is excellent. And, yes, the engine is slightly noisy at times but it's not loud by any means. The ride is very steady, smooth and even. The interior very stylish and the radio sounds great. As far as the quality of the controls. Everybody uses plastic these days. Seats are comfortable too.

mitsubishi,galant,2011,carriemae, 03/07/2013,Sport feel for Basic Sedan,3,"I purchased my red Galant as a 'prior rental'.
There is a big depreciation for Galants, so that is the only way I would buy one, as 'used'.
I like the sleek sides and look of the car.
The red is very pretty, especially just cleaned on a sunny day.
The car has a wide wheel base so feels good on the road, I think the power seem fine (I don't think it felt week like the pro review).
The interior, however, is very, very plain and cheap looking. ..charcoal cloth seats and black vinyl, holds dust.
Arm rests were separating and needed to be repaired by dealer.
However, engine seems fine...I think this is a great alternative to a Honda/Toyota for those on a budget if you keep it long."
mitsubishi,galant,2011,Tim396, 11/30/2018,Underrated and overlooked,4,"Tired of seeing poor ""cookie cutter, professional"" reviews for this car.  This is actually an excellent car and is my 2nd, new Galant (owned an '05 and now my '11).  After 180,000 miles of driving the 2011, I've only replaced one set of tires, front rotors/pads and the battery.    My only gripe would be that these cars only have a small pass-through from the trunk into the passenger compartment (no fold down rear seats) and that both my galants warped the front rotors after about 25k miles, but after installing a replacement set of slotted/crossdrilled rotors/pads on the '11 - I've had no problem after that.   I've enjoyed the car and continue to drive it daily with the only maintenance performed (outside of the typical oil/filter/air-filter changes) was that I changed the balancer shaft & timing belts, water pump/idler pulleys & accessory belt at 120,000mi. (required by the manual) and did it myself - that's it!  The SE has heated seats, remote start, backup camera, navigation, among other things and has a really nice vehicle monitoring/display system.  Too bad this car has been overlooked and underrated by the ""professional reviewers"".   I like driving something different and it stands out among the sea of Camrys and Accords.  Everything on this car continues to work and function as the day I bought it - very impressed!  Too bad they don't make the Galant anymore.
12/3/20(Update)- Just surpassed 215,000mi. and still going strong!  Performed another timing belt change at 190k, replaced RH tie rod and ball joint, new battery and tires.  No issues with original drivetrain and never a check-engine light.  Going for 300k+

mitsubishi,galant,2011,Mike, 07/13/2017,A great car for the money.,5,"I had a 2000 Galant before this, that my Niece still drives, the 2.4 motor is a good compromise of power and economy at 168 hp, the mileage is so so for midsize averaging about 26. The interior is not as nice as a Honda or Toyota, but the car is as reliable. It has many features for the price, and the car handles really well. although the car can give a choppy ride on bumpy roads, and is not as comfortable, except for 5 passengers is the most comfortable for a midsize car and better interior rooms then its competitor. There price can be really low compared to Honda and Toyota used. The model was discontinued in 2012.

mitsubishi,galant,2012,midway2, 06/17/2013,luv this car!,4,"I bought the 2012 Galant because i was looking for something that is reliable and got good gas mileage, and boy does it fit the bill.
But what really attracted me is you can get these only a year old at half of their original value, whereas Camrys, Accords etc. are thousands more.
The base ES model lacks some bells & whistles found on other cars, however the interior room,comfort and ride is surprisingly good. The body style is a tad dated (from 2004) but with the money I saved it doesnt matter. Power is adequate.
Overall a good, solid, reliable vehicle that can be had for a good price."
mitsubishi,galant,2012,Len Hilliker, 11/27/2016,Best kept secret,5,"In my opinion, the Mitsubishi Galant is one of the best kept secrets when it comes to a reliable vehicle. I absolutely love my car. It's a shame the Galant does not get better reviews. Best bang for your buck without a doubt! My only complaint would be that the 2.4 i4 is a little under powered. With that said, I still feel the power is adequate and the car is fun to drive. If you are thinking about getting a used car, save some money over a Honda or Toyota and test drive a Galant. I'm fairly confident that  you won't be disappointed.

The depreciation is high but not an issue for me since I keep a car for at least 10 yr. Reliability has been excellent with zero problems. SE ride is a little stiffer than base model but handling is excellent. I'm not sure what the other reviewer hated so much about this car."

I never had any problems with it besides basic maintenance: brakes, battery. The interior is comfortable and pretty. I don't understand why people are giving this car such a bad review. It could use a little more power but it still got me around without any problems.

My wife and I made the purchase in Virginia and drove it to Eastern Pennsylvania (our home). We drove through some wicked storms and a ton of traffic around DC and Baltimore and all I can say is this car is a dream to drive. We were able to stop at dealers (Nissan) for FREE charges on the way home. Our cost $0!! 169 miles for free!!!
I'll be using it for work and our average cost will be around $2.51 per 100 miles or $12.55 for 500 miles of driving. You can't beat that! If I fill it up over night, the cost goes even lower."

The car completely changed my way of thinking as EV owner and driver. Going to a gas station is now hassle to me. Range anxiety is non existent as I learned that I need to think just a little before going for a trip. If the expected distance is above 75-80 miles, I take our Jetta TDI, that simple. Very recently, I have taken my iMiEV for a long trip to test its range when driving up to 40 MPH w/o A/C. I was able to get 93.4 miles with 1 mile remaining. No need to reach for the hidden reserves.

This is the one that scares the oil companies and the car repair shops."
mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,ev_owner, 09/17/2012,Can you tell I like my car?,5,"So far I've only had one month of ownership.
No regrets.
My other vehicle has been used just a few times since buying this one.
There is enough torque/acceleration to pull away from the crowd at traffic lights if one wanted to.
The comfort is not perfect for all day driving, but for the hour max that the car would be driven, it's adequate.
The initial cost may be higher compared to other compact cars, but the eventual total cost of ownership is calculated to be lower.
(Pay a little more up front for greater benefits down the road.)
The vehicle is very stable since the wheels are located at the corners. "
mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,mitsulover, 08/16/2014,Not the only one in town anymore,4,"Lack of back seat leg room and basic seat design meant I could only give the car a ""3"" for comfort (but it's not advertised as a family hauler anyway).
I already had two Mitsus, so, I had to pick the I-MiEV over the Leaf.
But if you have a family of 4, buy the Leaf.
As with my other Mitsus, the Japanese built or designed models (think Lancer vs. Galant) seem to have a better build quality and design (this one has the ""J"" VIN).
Like my Buell, this thing is still rare enough to get lots of people coming by with questions, so be prepared.
At $0.15 per KWhr, I pay a little over $3 for a full (22 hrs @ 110V) charge which gives me a little over 60-miles on the freeway or 80+ in the city.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2017 update: got rear-ended by a Chinese student on a Visa driving a Maserati (and yep, had no insurance-forgot to ask mom and dad for insurance?), anyway, big heavy car just flicked the lil' Mitsu forward 20 or so feet.  Bent two brackets holding the bumper on and my bumper inherited a couple of dimples from his bumper, but otherwise I had to give it a high marks for safety.  Instead of 60 miles between charges, getting around 57 or 58  (ya, I notice because I drive pretty much the exact same route everyday-this is my work car).  I guess the battery has dropped-off a little.  Wow, didn't realize the resale value for electric cars was so bad.  Noticing 2 or 3 year old Leafs, 500's, MiEVSs, etc. selling for less than half of MSRP.  Not sure same is true for Teslas, but, if you are going to get an electric car, you would be crazy to buy one new.  Still liking it.  Spunky torque off the line, skinny enough to fit in any spot and not get door dings.  After an ordeal to get my front windshield replaced, I discovered that these cars are still really rare and if something needs to be replaced, it is a special order and a couple of weeks wait for just about any part.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2019 update.  Well, this may be the end of the line for my 7 year old miev. At 45,000, I don't think it was use that killed the battery pack, but just age (total range now 37 miles if I take city streets, a little over 20 on the freeway).  If I can't get the dealership to give my a new or refurbished battery pack under the existing warranty, it will not be worth the 10K to buy a new one.  California is all about getting you into an electric car, but, they seem to have no problem with sending them to the landfill after 7 or 8 years since no one (maybe Tesla owners excluded) is going to pay 2X what their 500, Leaf, or I-car is worth to buy a new battery pack.  I have been looking a the Eclipse Cross....

mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,sandange, 09/04/2012,Great little car,4,"We have had the car now for over 2 months & put over 5000 km on it. The car has performed better than we had hoped for, & it is our only car. Comfortable, great visibility, and quiet.

 We plan to swap for or rent a gas car should we need to go on any long trips.

 We are 2 drivers sharing this one electric car and it has already saved us a whole lot of money from
fuel bills. 




There was an adjustment period to get comfortable with the range limits, no prob driving our regular routes, Work commute, Shopping, Family visits.

Once we got familiar with the charging station locations, we started enjoying taking longer trips, venturing further and further.
A great all round car"
mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,carefulbuyer4, 09/17/2014,Best kept secret in the USA electric car market,4,"Had this car for nearly two years 10,000 miles. Better than expected. At the price, if Mitsubishi and its dealers had a clue how to sell these it should be the best selling EV in the USA. Worldwide there are more of these on the road (and have been on the road years longer) than any other commercial serious electric car.
In my opinion, if you're shopping for an electric car in the under $33K range if you're lucky enough to be able to find one of these you'd do well to grab it. The demand is low because of lack of public knowledge of this car, but so is supply."
mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,newb_i, 04/20/2012,After 2 weeks and 140 miles,3,"After 2 weeks of daily driving still as satisfied as the first day I got it. Easy to park, confortable for its size, and the best... NO GAS.

My recommended improvements for the i-MiEV Engineers: need to improve the noise isolation from outside, when in traffic, one can hear outside noise, with the windows closed as they were open. Thee suspension/stability maybe improved to make freeway commuting more smooth and minimize suceptibility to strong winds.

Overall, I am very satisfy with the i-MiEV.
I recommend it if your rutinary commute is within 50-60 miles in between charges. "
mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,DocJr., 07/21/2017,My experiment with the electric car just that,3,"If San Diego Gas and Electric is your utility, then this review applies.  I was one of the first adopters in my S. O'side neighborhood.  As I am a huge Mitsubishi fan (I have two others), and, since an electric car was an experiment, and no used ones available yet in my local area, I took a plunge on the $12K (you can get a $7,500 Fed tax rebate and a $2,500 California credit) 2012 Mitsu (Leaf was at least 5K more) I got from out-of-state.  But even with the special SDG&E EV rates (which require you to charge only at night or pay a penalty), I am averaging 20 miles/$.  The (albeit ugly) Mitsu Mirage gets 50 mpg which at the current (temporarily low?) price of $3/gallon, works out to 16 miles/$.  But here's the deal breaker.  At around 30K miles, my range is down about 10%.  I figure by 40K miles (next year sometime), the car will be not worth keeping unless Mitsu honors the battery warranty.  Since a replacement battery is $10K (or so), and the car is worth around $4K on Craigs List now, my car has depreciated around (I bought it in 2013) $2K/year.  I figure I am saving $195 (difference between a years gas at today's prices in the Mirage vs. the i-MiEV electricity cost).  I looked at used Mirages, and they depreciate less, and, are able to get you to work and back after 40K miles.  I wonder what California will do with all of the 4 and 5 year old electric cars that are just now trickling into junk yards (Leaf battery exchange is ONLY $5,500-parts only).  Will I buy another electric?  Heck ya, but let's see how the 200-mile latest and greatest (Chevy Bolt or Tesla Model 3) holds-up first.  Sometime in 2018, I'll have to switch to driving my Mitsu SUV to work.  One last thing, there are so many electric cars in S. Calif. now that the carpool isn't any faster when traffic is at it's worst.

Jan 2018 update: Just hit 30K and my range is down 20%.  I am just able to make it to work and back.  Car still looks great.  Too bad some third party doesn't make battery replacements.

July 2018 update: have not noticed any further drop in range.  Maybe it's because it is warmer and the car does seem to go father in warmer temps.  My plant manager won't let me plug my car in at work anymore (was using an outlet on side of building since we have no dedicated EV charger).  Now I have to drive my other car whenever I need to go somewhere at lunch or afterwork since my range has been reduced to getting my to work and back and not much else.  FYI: a lot of early Leafs are hitting the junk yard because CA hasn't grasped the fact that owners need help funding battery replacements, but, this means I can pick-up spare chargers pretty cheap now.

mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,A J, 09/10/2017,Excellent city car/second car or first Electric Ca,5,"I owned the car for more than 3 years and driven over 20,000 miles. Bought it used and got a great deal on it. After a couple issues that were resolved under warranty (long time at dealership due to parts availability). However, they gave me something else to drive for free so no major complaints. It is a basic car which serves it purpose well, for around town car and for small drives. I do not take it on the highway or long trips. Charge it overnight with the OEM charger and lasts me couple days due to short commute and occasional trips to the grocery store. Using the heat in winter causes about 30% dip in the weather, including defrosting the car while plugged in with the remote. The car has a good getup and go from stop, however not the best handling in slightly bad weather. I installed winter tires and survived just fine. The heated driver seat is extremely hot and I rarely use it. The car gets a lot of attention and comments. It is our primary car and have saves us a lot of trips to the gas station. Seats are very basic and not comfortable for long rides or bumpy roads, the storage space is very minimal; however rear seats fold flat. I have driven 72 miles with 6 miles left on the guess-o-meter.
Update** The car does surprisingly well in Chicago winter also with some snow tires. There is surprising amount of room in the car if you ever have to carry some cargo. I can fit a 7 ft Christmas tree or 15+ bags of mulch and 30+ folding chairs in the car. Excellent car for city use or for a work car.

mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,genec, 11/30/2015,A used one is the greatest secret in cars.,5,"Mitsubishi just upped their warranty on the battery to 10 years, 100,000 miles. If you can score a used Miev for under $10k and under 10k miles, you will have achieved something really valuable. All-electric cars have many less parts than a gas engine care counterpart, so expect much less in terms of repairs/maintenance. That's a dirty little secret about electric cars and the reason that car dealers don't push them, dealerships make 3 times the money in maintenance than they do in car sales.
So, beat the system and get an electric. And if you get a solar array on your house or in your backyard you will be transporting yourself using sunlight as your fuel source. How cool is that?
Oh yeah, there is no sales tax on used electrics. I saved another $700 that way.

mitsubishi,i-miev,2012,Jack, 08/10/2016,great alternative to nissan leaf,4,"Does the same thing as Nissan's leaf but costs less and has more headroom
"
mitsubishi,i-miev,2016,Barry L, 08/12/2016,2-1/2 years into owning a 2016 Mitusubishi iMiEV,5,"iMiEV is a basic modest simple vehicle - which is what we're used to (we also own a Toyota Yaris). Good for local travel, not long distance, although it does also have the 30 min. fast-charge port, if one wants to try for longer distances using public charging stations. But be aware that frequent fast charges age the battery faster - this is true for all lithium-battery EV's. 

Range:  During warmer weather, actual range on local roads is about 70 miles. Range gauge after a local road trip and then recharge will show as much as 85 miles. But I haven't gone this far - my longest trips are about 60 mi, and the gauge shows about 10 mi. left when I get home. Plus there's about another 5 miles of driving ""on the turtle"", maybe a bit more. The battery seems to holding up, no obvious loss of charge-holding capacity yet. The range-remaining gauge seems accurate, although its calculation is based on the last 15 min. of driving.  In hot weather, using the A/C may lop about 10 miles off the range, but often it can be run intermitttently.  In colder weather, the range drops; after a recharge range drops to as low as 60 miles (after off-highway driving).  Using the heater would knock this down further. Instead of the heater, I use a 12V heated travel blanket on my lap for winter driving, plus a warm pair of heavy wool socks and looser shoes. This winter also got some 12V heated gloves, very helpful.  But I'm can see why some folks install one of those little kerosene or alcohol burning heaters.

In very cold weather, the window defroster seems a bit underpowered. Under some circumstances, defrost is inadequate unless one runs heat plus AC. More range loss.

When the range remaining drops to about 10 miles, the gauge starts to blink as a warning that a battery recharge will be needed soon. Driving the car into a very low battery state triggers a turtle-shaped dash light, and results in somewhat reduced performance to save power.  I drove about 5 miles ""on the turtle"" just one time and got home without a problem - able to drive up to 35 mph, didn't try for more in any case. 

As for drivability, highways feel fine at 65-70 mph, but it's a small car, and you'll feel it on a windy day or when a big rig zooms past. 60 mph feels more stable. On local roads, it handles  a bit like a go-cart, and is fun to drive. It has good pickup: the motor is directly coupled to the wheels, and the car feels quite zippy. Another plus: the car is QUIET. Stability on snowy roads isn't bad, I think in part because the regenerative braking puts a drag on the rear wheels that helps keep the car straight. In this way, rather like driving a rear-wheel drive car with a clutch, in snow or ice.

We charge it overnight at 120VAC household, 12A, and this suffices for about 2 hrs of driving per day, my usual use. The car can also be charged at 240VAC (twice as fast) but you need a 240V line and a special charger unit that runs about $500.  (Price is steep, and there isn't that much inside these, they are just over-priced. In fact, the 120V chargers can be converted to 240V - people show how on youtube.) I have no 240V line to the outside of my house, and haven't needed faster charging anyway. 

I find the front seats comfortable. They are heated, although it's a mild warmth, not hot. Front side mirrors also have a heating option for winter. Seating and windshield are a bit higher than in the Yaris, and I like the better visibility.

Biggest negative to my mind is the poor safety rating of the rear seats. Also, the defroster could be more powerful. Lastly, for cold-weather driving, a bigger battery would have been a plus to compensate for range loss by use of heat. As a city car, the imiev is perfect. I have some commutes totaling around 60 miles. In very cold weather, I've avoided them by carpooling or taking the Yaris.

The rear seats can be lowered flat, and the car can
 then used to move fairly good sized objects. For us, that's included a dishwasher and a set of tall Ikea shelf kits. Very handy.

mitsubishi,i-miev,2017,i heart mi MiEV, 09/22/2016,Compare: what do you want?,5,"What do you want an electric car to do?  Better question--what do you want YOUR electric car to do?  Zip around and make you look cool?  There's a Tesla for that.  Practical wagon / hatchback that you can use for slightly longer range trips?  VW e-Golf, Nissan Leaf, or Kia Soul EV.  Small, practical, extremely economical run-around car for errands with the kids and groceries that's also pretty fun to drive?  This Mitsubishi i MiEV, Spark EV, and Fiat 500e.  For a cost-effective answer in this last category, I don't think you can beat the i MiEV, depending on the price you can pick one up for.  A few weeks ago, we bought a '16 after trying and crunching numbers on several of the other cars listed above.  Was it the best?  Depends.  Was it the most acceleration and range and best handling?  Clearly not.  Was it the most economical EV option we could find?  Definitely.  We got ours for what we think was a screaming deal (especially including the up-to-$7500 tax credit: check your own tax situation before you assume a $7500 rebate on the price of the car...) and it fits precisely what we need / want it for.  We have an amazing charging network around us and, yes, we wish our iMiEV would go farther and charge faster, but we weren't even considering roughly double the net price (after the tax rebate) for things that for us are pretty marginal considerations.  I'm risk tolerant and have already pushed the limits of range and proximity to a charging network when I've traveled solo (without family).  If you're using this to bop around town or for a reasonable-length daily commute as a second ""utility"" family car, I simply don't think you can beat the economics of the i MiEV it if you get it at the right price.  Charing overnight at home via the included charger isn't elegant, but it works fine and this car isn't really about elegant.  The included CHAdeMO fast charger is a boon for the unlikely / rare occasions when you'll want to go beyond its range (for me, driving it back home from the dealer many times farther away than the car's range--adventure!).  For what *we* need it for, the reduced range affects us not at all.  Although it's pretty darn fun to drive, it's not a Tesla roadster or even anything that imitates a sportscar.  It's not meant for a cross-country road trip (though as I've mentioned, I've already dabbled a little in that) as it's pretty obviously only a second car unless you live in an urban area and don't intend to venture far from it with the iMiEV.  If it's about $/kWh and the associated $/electrical mile traveled (including cost of vehicle...), this would seem to win hands down.  If you want a sporty car that makes heads turn and goes 200+ miles on a charge, get a Tesla...or wait and pay whatever they're going to fetch for the upcoming 200-ish mile range cars (range ~= battery capacity ~= cost...), but that's the tradeoff--it's unlikely there's going to be a free lunch (i.e. a 200-mile range car priced similarly to a current 80-mile range car).  The i MiEV is shockingly cheap to own and operate (again, depending on the net price you pay).  Pun intended.  $xx,xxx cost - up to $7,500 in federal tax credit - possibly $y,yyyy in state tax rebate = $z,zzz.  What, really?  A new EV car for a net of $z,zzz?  I'll take one, please...

It has a lot better acceleration than my 1988 Honda CRX and yet has 20 cu ft more storage area than a Nissan Leaf (50 cu ft with the back seats down). You sit high and the center of gravity is low so driving this vehicle is a delight! My wife an I found that 98% of our driving each day requires less than the 64 mile range limit of this vehicle. From great visibility to its heated front seats this can be the car for most people. It has high safety ratings and has been sold world wide since 2012... this is not a test... this is the real thing! In WA State there is no sales tax on an electric vehicle of this price and we were able to take advantage of the federal tax rebate of $7500 making this car $15,000. It has three drive modes. Most of the reviews must have been in the Eco mode whereas I drive almost exclusively in the B (for Blast) mode that gives me acceleration when I want it and is the most aggressive in recharging the batter when I let up on the accelerator or hit the brakes. You have to try this car for yourself, I know you'll love it.

mitsubishi,i-miev,2017,Barry Levine, 11/19/2018,"Great urban car or 2nd car, fun to drive.",4,"I've had my iMiev for over 2 yrs. First off, EPA range of 64 mi. refers to highway driving. On city or suburban roads, the range is as high as 80 miles, although in very cold weather this will drop to about 60 miles. ""Range Anxiety"" will dissipate once you're familiar with the car. Battery status and range-remaining gauges are useful. Planning your trips with Google maps is worth doing, if you're approaching the range limits. BTW, back roads are usually shorter, more pleasant, with less traffic. The car is responsive with good pickup, although this is more noticeable when moving than from a dead stop. But I leave plenty of folks in the dust when a light changes, if I need to. Pretty quiet but typical small car road noise at higher speeds. Not bad on the highway, but you'll be much happier at 70 than 80. Charging time (for completely discharged battery) is 14 hrs at 110V and I just charge it overnight, no problem. I plan my trips (musician, traveling to local gigs) and have driven home on ""the turtle"" (low battery indicator on) just once. No more gas stations! Charging time only 7 hrs if you invest in a 220V charger. The car also has the fast-charge slot (80% in 30 min.) but I don't use it. On the con side, the rear seats are not rated as safe as the front seats. Using the electric heat will pull the range down 10 or more miles (but it has heated front seats, and with a 12V lap blanket, winter in New England is tolerable.) The AC works well, and pulls down the range 7 miles or so if run continuously. Back seats fold down, so the car can haul plenty of stuff if need be. ""The little car that could.""

Adequate range, easy parking in tight spaces downtown, extremely economical and fun to drive.  No, it's not a Tesla, it's plain and a bit funky, but so what.  I love passing by the gas stations to recharge in my own garage.  It even handles snow on our steep driveway amazingly well.

mitsubishi,i-miev,2017,Tony J, 11/18/2020,MItsubishi will not honor battery warranty,3,"I bought a Mitsubishi Miev in 2013.  While it is basic, it was well designed and has given me years of service.  However, I counted on its 10 year battery warranty.  The range has declined to 35 miles to 40 miles, inconsistently and unreliably.  I only drive sporadically, so the car has been driven only about 28,000 miles.  The annual average for American drivers is  12,000 miles per year.  Despite the fact that the battery does not provide a useful range at this point, and the range is between 50% to 66% of the original expected range, and despite the fact that the battery has only been used approximately a third of what would have been expected by now, Mitsubishi has refused to honor its battery warranty.

The gas mileage both in town and on the highway is great, but the best thing about the car is that the only maintenance it has required has been regular oil changes and new tires. Considering the engine it has, the car has decent pickup upon acceleration, and is fun to drive. I expect my Lancer to last me for years to come. I highly recommend this car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,goosepsu, 02/08/2002,Convinced,5,"Just bought 2002 Lancer LS in black.  There were virtually none in the northeast (the dealer sent my sales rep via train and taxi to pick up the car on a snowy day... steve is my hero) but once we sat in it, we loved it.  It looks, feels, and is a great car.  We own a 2002 Toyota Corolla, and though the Corolla's history of reliablity is golden, it is not unique.  The Lancer is unique, extremely fun, and gets alot of double-takes on my morning commute.  I love it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,bina, 11/09/2003,Love this Car,4,"I Got into a major accident when this
car had less than 3,000 miles on it. I
was rear ended on the thru-way going 65
mile per hour because the man behind me
was watching the accident and not the
cars in front of him. My car had over
$9,000 worth of damage to it, and I want
you to know, every safty feature
including the crumple zone worked
perfectly. We had tons of presents in
the trunk and not one thing broke, The
whole trunk shifted to the ground,
leaving all of the trunks contents and
us perfectly safe. No one was injured
and I was happy I had chose this car!!!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,ksdclan, 02/17/2006,Disappointed,3,We loved our Mitsubishi Lancer until we found out that once we recked the vehicle in an accident that the air bag did not go off.  Our vehicle was totaled in the accident.  The whole front of the car was torn in half and sqished into the front tires and the air bag never deploied.  I am dissappointed in the car.
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Mitsu63, 07/12/2015,I wish I still had my Lancer!,5,"I bought a used '02 Lancer ES in 2005 for $8k. It already had almost 100k miles on it and had evidently seen some use, as there was wear on both the steering wheel and headrests. I was looking for something to drive for a couple of years and then trade up. I am so grateful I didn't get around to carrying out that plan before the crash in 2008, because after that I was stuck with every item of value I already had due to not being able to buy new ones. My Lancer came through for me in a big way! I hardly did any maintenance on it at all, spent the bare minimum, yet it lasted me until 2014 and I racked up almost 250,000 miles on it. Towards the end things started breaking and that was why I ended up selling it - if I had been able to afford the new clutch it needed, I would probably still be driving it. 

Things I loved about my Lancer:

Gas mileage! I was getting 33 mpg in mixed driving, I swear to god. 
Roomy and versatile - I used it to haul firewood, used it to move with (crammed all kinds of furniture into it), drove down dirt roads, up mountains and on freeways, spent inordinate amounts of time traveling in it, and plenty of time with the seat reclined taking naps at rest stops. 
Ease of driving - the clutch pedal is very light and took a minute to get used to, but once I adjusted to that it was easy to drive, very forgiving. Road feel was good, handled well, and a great turning radius. 
Safety - as much time as I spent on the road (I travel for my job) I had to make several panic stops and the car did great, kept me safe and unharmed. 
Bells and whistles - the Lancer had exactly the right combination of conveniences and simplicity for my taste. It had electric windows and mirror adjustments (not bad for a base model), a/c that worked great, a decent stereo with CD player, but none of the more fancy features such as headlights that turn themselves on and off, bluetooth, etc. that I personally have no use for anyway and find aggravating.
Ergonomics - the seat adjusts in several directions and the steering wheel adjusts as well. Everything is within reach and convenient. The seats recline all the way back for those rest stop naps. My only complaint is the resistance on the heat/cold adjustment knob - it was a bit tight and the knob eventually broke. 
Power - for a little econo-sedan, it actually had a reasonable amount of get-up-and-go, and I could pull away from stop lights quickly if I needed to, pass people, and keep up with people in bigger cars when needed. I had it up above 100 mph on more than one occasion, although I wasn't really comfortable taking it much above that. 
Value - let's face it, these cars don't hold a lot of value but that means you can pick up a used one cheap like I did. Expenditure-wise, mostly all I ever did was put gas and oil in it, brakes a couple of times, timing belt at 150k, and some new tires every couple of years. I think I had to buy a set of windshield wipers once. Towards the end, it needed more done to it but it was up over 200,000 miles by that point. 

I loved my Lancer and would buy another one.

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,OZ Lancer Fan, 11/15/2010,2002 Mitsu OZ Lancer,4,"I bought this car brand new. Eight years later, I have had no major problems with the car. I am currently at 145,000 miles and the car still retains the original timing belt!  Other than the timing belt, I've kept to the suggested maintenance schedule and have had no problems. With a regular waxing, twice a year, the car also has no rust. I would recommend for higher mileage cars ""Mobile Synthetic Oil- High Mileage"". I noticed that you get more power than other oils.  This is a low maintenance car, and I plan on having this as my daily driver for a good 200k-400k more miles. I believe this is doable with the lack of problems I have had with this car. I highly recommend Mitsu Lancers."

Been in three wrecks 1) old man cut me off and I trash is bumper all I did was crack my bumper and headlight. 2 hit a dear at 50 mph and knocked paint off and 3 hit a ditch sideways at about 85 mph flew out of thedmunds - once a weeke ditch and got stuck. Just had to replace a strut and some tires. Car looks like a mess but still gets me 40 mpg. Only change oil and tires. Have not even changed spark plugs or wires or belts and still pull strong like the day I got it. Clutch went out at 90k. Fairly easy to replace myself as it was my first try at clutch replacement. I drive a year on new tires without rotation."

I have been more than happy with this car - very little has gone wrong with it and I am almost at 197,000 miles!!!  This thing drives great,  with so many miles still gets around 35 mpg!!!  When this car finally dies I will most likely get another Mitsubishi."

I dont deserve it.  It looks, feels, 
like a luxury car.  The red gauges look 
BMW like, the interior is refined, 
huge, the outside is beautiful.  With 
the 2.0L engine, it has enough power 
accelerating and merging.  The engine 
is so quiet and the ride is as soft as 
any luxury car.  The corolla's engine 
is about 5x as loud and the ride seemed 
stiff.  The corolla seems way heavier 
and doesnt accelarate as fast and as 
quietly as the lancer.  The civics have 
a smaller engine then the lancer, the 
lancer looks kick 
ass while the civic looks conventional, 
and it is bigger then the civic."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,karl27, 02/16/2003,Lancer mania,4,"Lancer can be a formidable opponent of 
Honda and Toyota. The quiet engine, the 
functional power controls inside the 
cabin, and the cabin space itself makes 
the car cozy and fun to drive. I should 
say that making those sharp corner 
turns amazed me how this car kept 
itself on the ground and stable. The 
driver-adaptive shift technology on the 
other hand seems to not matter at all. 
I didn't  feel the difference between 
this technology and a regular automatic 
transmission equipped car. But for the 
price and the features of this car, 
it's worth driving."

months it has over 28K. I haven't had 
any problem so far. I used to have a 
1993 Lancer GLX, it was a very nice 
car. So, I decided to buy another one 
in 2002. I am very happy with that. 
It's very roomy and comfortable. It's 
good handling and the accelaration is 
adequate not great. It gets better at 
high speed, I hit 120MPH easily(sorry 
cops!!!). The quality is fine but I 
would prefer better interior quality. 
Not very happy with the gas mileage. I 
can say it is average. The wind noise 
is a little bit high but generally the 
car is quiet at highway speed. It comes 
with good standard package and it is 
very fun to drive!"

exhaust valve had to be replaced after 
a year and a half, but it was still 
running great and the service engine

love the turning radius.  2 adults can 
fit comfortably in the back seat for

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Lancer ES Review, 03/31/2005,Lancer ES Review,5,"The car is great, 50,000 miles and still going just as the day I bought it. Very spacious and has no problems. The Adaptive Shift Control provides precise shifts according to my driving. For immediate passing to being a gasoline saver, the adaptive shift control works great. Sure it only has 120 hp and 130 lb feet of torque, but when you step on the gas, the transmission will immediately downshift and you will feel the torque over the power band. Provides great reliability as well. Not one problem reported yet and it has 50,000 miles on it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Carknut, 05/14/2005,Bang for Buck,4,"Actually, this car is just a solid deal all around. Hands down better than any other compact on the road. I have driven it 12,000 miles in the last 5 months - averaged 360 miles per tank, love the seats, and overall ride. The best thing for performance in this car is the automatic tranny (wish I had a manual though). The auto is perfectly mated to the engine, so that it effectively uses the entire power range. I love driving the car, and I have no regerts with it. You'd be smart to pick one up."

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,RJK, 06/29/2005,"Dependable, Solid and Efficient",4,"After three years the only problem I have had with this car was its CD player, which the dealer replaced and reimbursed me for the CD that the player destroyed. Since then I have had no problems with the car.  I recently purchased new Bridgestone Turanza LS-T tires for the car and what a difference. The car was pretty stable before, with some road noise, but now it is really stable and with very little road noise. It is almost like a different car.  During these high gasoline price times I have come to really appreciate the gas mileage. I average about 29 mpg in town and 37 mpg on the open highway."

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,donald72, 02/26/2004,Headache-free Car,4,"This car is very reliable. It's drive-
and-go, worry-free. No breakdowns going 
almost 2 years now, factoring in 
reasonable maintenance. Power is not so 
good, wont make you grin on green 
lights. When it comes to uphill climbs 
its hearty torque shows, that's where 
it more than makes up for its 
inadequate horsepower. Ergo: slow on 
flat roads but nimble on uphill climbs. 
The car is rigidly built. That's why it 
weighs around 400 lbs. more than your 
Corolla or Civic due to more metals 
used.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,teknooh, 04/07/2006,Fantastic car for the price,4,"I have owned two Lancers, the basic model and now an OZ, and I have to say I love this car.  There's nothing spectacular about it, but for the money I feel like I own a quality vehicle that will take care of me.  I also disagree that it's severely underpowered.  Sure I'm not going to win any races, but it is faster than my friend's Ford Focus.  It gets gas good, mileage especially on the highway and generally is just a pleasure to drive.  Even a friend who owns an Audi said he was surprised at how well-put- together my little Japanese car seemed to be.  I would definitely purchase this car again and again, and I've recommended it to several people."

There has been no major problems, other than bad rotors. However, the interior is not holding up, everything is slowly falling off. The paint job is horrible, it looks like I have two different paint colors on one side. I rotate my tires with every oil change and check my alignment, yet it still shakes on the freeway horribly.

I added 18"" custom wheels, which made it look much better. The stock tires are tiny. The interior is bland but functionality-wise is great. A lot of interior space for a small car. The car has been very reliable. I've had zero major problems. Engine-wise the only thing I've had to replace is one ignition coil, which wasn't too costly. The car doesn't have much muscle - slightly more horses than a Civic - but it's what you'd expect for this class of car. I really like the stock sound system. It's fairly loud and clear, and after over 3 years still sounds the same as when I bought the car."

The reason why performance is not a ten is because it has slowed slightly in its old age due to the fact that I beat it up. Only basic maintenance has been done because that's all it ever needed. I am quite surprised since it is a first year model. I have never had to doubt my safety in it and have off roaded in it despite the fact that its a sedan. I don't even avoid pot holes and after five years, still great suspension! I get roughly 32-33 miles to the gallon w/126,000 miles and counting. I will cry when I retire it.  "

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,bradpepsi, 01/09/2003,Overpriced and Uncomfortable,3,"This has got to be the most 
uncomfortable car I've ever driven.  
The driver is very cramped and the gas 
pedal is far too sensitive.  The 
problem is you don't notice things like 
that on a test drive, its only when you 
go on a drive more than 30 minutes or 
so that you notice how uncomfortable it 
is.  Performance is much better than 
the reviews for it indicate, but the 
gas mileage is pathetic for a car with 
a 115 HP 4 cylinder engine (about 23 
mpg in the city).  At $17,300 for the 
automatic version, Mitsubishi is out of 
their mind.  I've had mine for only two 
months and am already looking to get 
rid of it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Anthony Morgan, 06/27/2019,A Decent Three Star Car,3,"I bought the car brand new off the showroom floor in 2002. I was between the Lancer and a Tacoma, but ultimately choose the Lancer. I consistently got oil changes and maintenance done. I had the car until 2010 when the engine caught fire(we’ll get to that). If I had the choice, I would not buy it again. 

It was the first new car I ever bought, and I immediately encountered problems. Driving home from the dealership, the engine began to smoke and smell. The dealer said not to worry as that’s what happens with new cars, but come to find out  it was all a lie. Within the first year, my power locks stopped working. I will admit that I have a lead foot, but if the car got anywhere even near 90mph, it began to shake violently. I have never had a car do that before or since. 

The car also had no get up and go whatsoever. There was no resilience from the car, and my rear  bumper crumpled when it should have only scratched. The car met its demise when I rear-ended an old pickup truck around 40mph. The truck had only a few scratches, but the entire front of my car instantly crumpled, immediately igniting the engine and the whole car quickly caught fire. 

I had the upgraded sound system, and it worked well. The car drove smooth at average speeds, and the interior was comfortable and the gauges were positioned nicely. The view out the back window was good as well. The rear seats folded down and there was ample trunk space. 

I since upgraded to an 09 Town and Country and have been much happier. All in all, if you gave me the car for free, I’d be happy with it, but it wasn’t worth the brand new sticker price.

more horsepower .at  least 160 horses"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,aka0014, 05/11/2002,Let's remeber what kind of car this is!,4,"I paid 15,500 for my O-Z (with the $500 
college rebate=$15,000).  What Civic, 
Focus, Sentra, and/or Corrolla can you 
get at that price with the 0-Z's extras 
and all around looks.  Secondly, the 
car is a compact car.  If you add more 
horsepower then it loses its purpose-a 
good, fun, affordable, attractive fuel 
efficient car.  Of course we all want 
more horses under that hood.  So just 
order the parts and put it in-problem 
solved!  This car is totally worth the 
money and then some.  Compare it to the 
top three in it's class, and you'll see 
how it by far surpasses the 
exterior/interior design and amenities 
that lack in its competitors for the 
same price."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,justin , 01/16/2009,My first car,4,"I love this car it had 101,000 miles when I got it, yea thats a little high but I have had absolutely no problem out of this car. Could use a turbo for a little more power but overall the only problem I see is it needs bigger rims but I love this car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,kjenning, 05/17/2002,I love this car!,5,"If you can find something wrong with 
this car then there jmust be something 
wrong with you. A little more power 
woudl be nice, but it gets me moving as 
fast as the law allows in short order.  
I have been supremely impressed with 
this vehicle.  The other cars in it's 
price range that I test drove were 
deplorable.  This car is a real class 
act and is beating out my 72' porsche 
as my most fun car to drive!  Now 
that's saying something!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Andrew Ciccolella, 05/17/2002,Incredible Car,5,"I have the OZ Racing Edition, and it is 
incredible.  The clutch is so smooth, 
and its performance is great.  It is 
loaded with extras for such a low price."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,vildal, 03/07/2009,Excellent car,4,"When purchased it was extremely zippy and quick.  At 100,000 miles it got sluggish until the ALTERNATOR belt was replaced.  The 2 spark plug wires that go into the engine made more spark too.  This performance of the Lancer depends highly on spark.  Great car - clutch goes out at 100,000 only.  No other repairs."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,OZZY Blake, 05/26/2002,Fun and economic!,4,"We just barely picked up our OZ and we 
love it.  It is fun to drive, looks 
great, and gets great mileage!  The 
clutch is very nice and extremely easy 
(a plus for someone with bad knees).  
It has lots of room inside, both front 
and rear and the rear is loaded with 
safety features built in for child 
seats!  This is by far the best deal 
in it's class.  It's quick, very 
smooth and quiet, sporty handling, and 
an economical family car!  If you want 
a sporty car, you got it.  If you want 
rally design, you got it.  And if you 
want an economical car, you got it!  
All for a great price."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,yeo_yeo, 05/29/2002,This car is ok...,4,"I'll give the OZ some credit...where 
credit is due. It's not a bad car, just 
not my kind of car. I've been driving 
Trans Am's all my life and the OZ just 
doesn't have the power that I'm used 
to. I really like the wheels, although 
16's or 17's would be better, and the 
look of the car is just furocious."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,deligreen, 06/03/2002,"Nice, but watch the paint!",4,"I just purchased my OZ a few weeks ago. 
The cosmetic problems have been 
associated with the side skirts.  The 
passenger side is not flush and needed 
to be replaced, and the top corners of 
both have to be repainted already.  The 
paint on the skirts is already 
chipping.  The radiator needed to be 
replaced because it was slowly 
leakingfluid. The only other problem, 
is that I find that the gears will 
grind everyonce in awhile even with the 
clutch all the way depressed.  I think 
this may be just because of a new 
transmition."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,AZ Lancer, 06/06/2002,Love the Lancer,4,"This car has been AMAZING!  Before 
deciding on the OZ Lancer, I test drove 
many cars in its class (Civic, Sentra, 
Focus), and nothing could compare to 
the Black OZ Lancer I have been driving 
for the last 6 months.  It is superior 
in every way!  I was sold on it as soon 
as I saw that it was styled differently 
than ANY other car on the road.  After 
half a year, it has gotten me from 
point ""A"" to point ""B"" with nothing but 
fun and energy in between.  A great buy!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Jason Rodriguez, 06/07/2002,Exilerating,5,"This car is one of the fastest 4 
cylinders, that i have ever driven. 
Very responsive and very stylish. More 
room than honda civic. I f friends are 
in the back, i still have the seat all 
the way back. Big trunk, good torque, 
good mileage! Couldn't be happier!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,GoodBuy, 06/08/2002,"Try One, Quality Car",5,"I have had my car about a month now. 
Feels very solid when driving. Turns 
corners very tightly which is handy 
getting into parking spaces. The 120 hp 
engine accelerates well and sounds good 
even when revving. I have the stick 
shift which I prefer on small cars. The 
car is put together very well. I could 
find no flaws. The interior is very 
well appointed for the price. All of 
these cars come with power windows and 
CD which is nice."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,vinod, 06/09/2002,Excellent----Simply Superlative,5,"This is my first new car and baby I 
love it. Always thought I would end 
with a Toyota or Nissan, but today 
would not dream of them. Excellent 
handling ooodles of power and most 
important 97% built in Japan. Very 
stylish looks and good fuel efficiency. 
Already put in 8000 miles in 6 weeks."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,lngtonge18, 06/11/2002,excellent car!,4,"I have had my OZ since November and 
absolutely love it. It's been flawless 
and the build quality is exceptional. 
Exterior is sporty and elegant, like a 
mini-BMW, and gets stares all the time. 
The interior looks great (love that 
brushed aluminum trim and the cream 
white gauges) and is so roomy. The ride 
is unbelieveably composed and 
comfortable up to 3 digit speeds. It 
handles good as well. My only 
complaints are the non-performance 
tires and the uncomfortable non-
adjustable lumbar sticking in my back. 
Otherwise, the Lancer is an excellent 
car and definitely worth a look."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Bankerman, 06/13/2002,Cheap and affordable.,2,"Nice little car, looks are ok and 
all...My only wish is that Mitsubishi 
would feel good enough about the car to 
give it a  3YR-36,000 mile bumper to 
bumper AND a 5YR-60,000 mile power 
train warranty like Toyota and Nissan 
does. If Mitsubishi doesn't want to 
STAND behind THEIR OWN VEHICLE for 
longer than 36/36,000...then why should 
I?
I mean, I could have bought an extra 
warranty, but why should I when Toyota 
and Nissan gives it for free."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,aerialcombat, 06/16/2002,Like my lancer!!!,4,"  Been driving my white lancer oz for 
about 3 weeks now. Got it for 16,500. 
and I must say i love it! The thing i 
love the most is the look of it. Most 
of the people get the yellow oz, but I 
got a white one, but i do not regret 
it. The car is smooth, and sexy. I 
love it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Jasper, 07/01/2002,Well Done,4,"Exterior and Interior are great for the 
price - if you compare to the Jetta - 
then you will be depressed, but 
compared to the Civic - coupled with 
the savings - winner every time.  The 
engine provides just what us econo 
shoppers are looking for - dependable, 
solid and pretty quick around the 
corners! Very happy with the purchase"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Timko, 07/22/2002,Kick asphault,5,"For the money I think this car iss one 
of the best out there.  But then 
again..the only rason i got one is 
because of the 0 down 0interest and 0 
payments for a year.  Top notch!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Lancer Guy, 08/06/2002,Super New Compact from Mitsubishi,4,"I wanted to trade in my 4x4 for an 
economy car since I am going to grad 
school.  I compared all compact mfgs.  
I&#8217;m 6&#8217;4, 245 lbs - Civic was too 
narrow, Corolla had poor driver 
legroom, and the Elantra felt a little 
cheap on some of the interior pieces.  
Protégé was roomy and nice.  However, 
ride was VERY stiff and jittery. Then I 
drove the Lancer OZ. It&#8217;s not going to 
satisfy the teen racer crowd without 
aftermarket mods,but in stock form it 
is a very peppy,solid, fun car to 
drive.  Very roomy upfront and in the 
back.  Excellent build quality, low NVH 
levels, and excellent IIHS crash 
results &#8211; it got a &#8220;Best Pick&#8221; rating."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,TobyG, 08/09/2002,What's with the performance complaints?,5,"OK, granted that I wasn't looking for 
a sports car when I purchased my OZ, 
but I'm still not sure where 
performance complaints are coming 
from.  When compared to the other 
compact cars that I owned in the past 
(a '93 Sentra and '87 Horizon), my 
Lancer is just flat out more fun and a 
better performer.  Add to that much 
better fuel economy (along with the 
other two) than the truck I traded for 
it ('96 Nissan Kingcab SE), and that's 
a recipe for an excellent compact 
transport."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,EazyEn16, 08/17/2002,my 02 ES LanceR,4,"This is a monster of a car in Japan. 
They tone it down for the US, dont ask 
me why. Lancer is on the cutting edge 
of what young people are looking for. 
Thats why i was so drawn to it. Im an 
aftermarket kind of guy, looking for 
performance out of my car. I know i 
could keep up with any Honda. Even 
though i just bought my car,like 4 
weeks ago, Im in love with it. The guys 
like it, and my gf loves it too."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,tthomas, 08/27/2002,GREAT LOOK NOT GREAT RUNNING,3,"I have had my Mitsubishi lancer for 1 
year and it has been back to the shop 3 
times since its purchase all major 
problem 1 the axle went 2 the radiator 
went 3 the material on the door panels 
is lifting and will need to be replaced 
I love this car for everything else but 
it's mechanical problems"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,bnnmalone, 09/04/2002,Lancer ES Review,4,"I looked at several different makes of 
cars and took the Mitsubishi Lancer for 
a test drive after I tested the 
others.  It was no comparison.  The 
Lancer was more responsive and had 
plenty of pep.  The vehicles exterior 
is very attractive and has smooth 
lines.  I really liked the OZ version 
but for around $3,000.00 more I can 
live with it and add to it as I go.  I 
couldn't be more pleased with this 
vehicle."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,TomK, 09/14/2002,Excellent value for money,4,"This car is a great deal! You get a 
lot for your money although I would 
have liked rear discs and ABS 
standard.  The build quality is 
excellent, lots of low end power for 
just 120hp, great stereo, rides 
nicely, handles well. Compared to the 
Golf/Jetta I also looked at, the 
interior is far roomier and the 
performance was better at least 
compared to the non-turbo versions. 
The clutch is very nice but the 5-
speed is a little notchy and is gated 
too close together."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Ken Martenz, 09/27/2002,AWESOME AND LOV'N IT,5,"I just purchased this car and I love 
it. I test drove many other cars in 
its' class and nothing compared. I love 
the ""boxy"" styling like rally cars and 
I think the car handles like a dream. I 
am getting on average 30mpg with the 5-
speed stick. The pickup is impressive 
for only 120hp while getting the 30mpg. 
I don't drive it easy either I'm going 
at least 70-80 on the highways to work 
and city traffic, let just say duck-and-
weave. The car is agile and very quick 
around corners. I've taken corners at 
high speeds and no tire squeel. Over 
all for what the car is, it is a 10, 
nothing added nothing subtracted as it 
comes."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Disapointed, 10/01/2002,Great Stlye poor quality,3,"I love the way it looks on the outside. 
very satisfied with the interior. 
Extremely disappointed with quality. 
I've had my car for 10months now , have 
22300 miles on it. So you can see I 
drive alot. About at the 9mos mark the 
car started to rattle near the rear. 
The service department has not been 
able to figure out why. This is 
something I would have expected from my 
last car the Plymouth Breeze. The main 
reason I switched to Mitsu, to avoid 
these ridiculous problems extremely 
disappointed."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,hmperz, 10/01/2002,lancer,4,"I love the look of the car.  It's 
different.  Sporty but not 
extravagent.  The engine department 
could use a little more power.  But, I 
am extremely impressed in the gas 
mileage.  The handleability of the 
vehicle is ok."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,x-beemerDrvr, 11/04/2002,Fun like my Z3,5,"Used to have a BMW Z3. Had to sell it 
because of my company's downsizing. Had 
to settle for the OZ but never regreted 
the change. Even having the automatic, 
the acceleration is fantastic even 
uphill. It's been 4 months now, and I 
am still hooked. Also bought my wife 
one but the ES version."

I HAVE HAD A CHEVY, DODGE, JEEP, AND A 
VW AND THERE IS NO COMPARISON THIS CAR 
IS SO GREAT. IT HAS EVERYTHING I WANTED

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Steven Lawson, 10/16/2002,2002 OZ Rally Edition is Great Overall,4,"Great Handling Car.  I took the car 
shortly after I bought it on a road 
trip through the mountains of Virginia 
and West VA at 70 miles an hour with no 
body roll and great handling.  Fun car 
with plenty of speed for your average 
driver.  The only thing that really 
needs improvement is the acceleration"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Misha, 11/16/2002,All's Good with the Lancer OZ,5,"I really have to say, I love the car.  
It looks good and its fun to drive.  
Its not as fast as the impreza wrx but 
for the 2.0 engine its decent.  I wish 
there were more accessories out there 
for it, but i think that in time that 
will increase."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,dasharc, 11/26/2002,A Nimble Machine,4,"After almost 2 months of walking away 
from testdrives that 'just didnt feel 
right', I knew the Lancer was for me 
the minute I sat in the drivers seat. 
Its comfortable, stylish, and 
nimble..not to mention fun. The car 
makes you want to drive because it 
simply takes to the road and wont let 
go! The highway is the best place for 
the OZ, but its just as much a joy to 
buzz around town in. The ride is smooth 
and effortless at any speed. Theres 
plenty of room for rear passengers 
without cramping anyone and with the 
fold-down seats this car is practical, 
too."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,jeffskibo, 02/27/2002,good/great,4,"great looks both interior and exterior.  Corners really well and a smooth ride, however severely lacks power which is a trade-off for great gas mileage."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,O-Z, 12/07/2002,2003 OZ,4,"I bought a 2003OZ.It's not bad compared 
to other vehicles in its class, but 
since the OZ is the 'Rally Racing' it 
could use a stiffer clutch, and a short 
shifter wouldn't hurt.The seats are not 
that bad, but could be lowered just a 
tad.There is a wind whistle when i 
reach 100kph,took it to the dealer and 
they did nothing. They said they'll 
call me when the part it need will 
arrive.It's been almost two weeks and 
no call yet."

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,grubgal, 01/06/2003,OZ Lancer,4,"I have had my Lancer for almost a year 
now.  It has been reliable.  Needs more 
horsepower.  I also think tires need to 
be a little more tacky.  And also come 
with 16"" or 17"" wheels.   Could be a 
little better on cornering.  Needs ABS 
at least as an option.  In the snow I 
slid because I didn't have them.  
Overall, though it is a good value for 
the price.  However, I think my dealer 
ripped me off because it seems that I 
paid more than everyone else...$18K?!  
The only option I got was the rear 
spoiler.  So who knows..."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Tamra, 01/11/2003,Superb compact sedan,5,"This is one of the best small compact

mitsubishi,lancer,2002,sr71, 03/03/2002,The OZ is pretty OK,4,"Fun car to drive at a good price. But this car just lacks the power to back up its looks. And the tires that it comes with are about a sticky as wet ice. The front end needs a strut bar as it does have some flex, and higher rate springs and dampers are needed. And the air box needs to be replaced, the poor thing is starving for air.  Great 3rd or 4th car. Tops for kids a lot of show but very, very little go."

roughly 25,000 miles, and gas mileage

I have beat the heck out of my car at the race track, both drag and sport track, and it just keeps going very soundly.  It is fast on the straightaways, really hard turns, and three wheels to the ground driving later, this car won't stop.  I was worried when I got close to my warrenty expiring, I tried to provoke anything that would go wrong after 60,000 before it so its under warrenty, and free.  Well, if anyone could make an engine bomb out, its me, and every morning I still find myself face to face with an excellent running car.  It needs more power though."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,RSGJR, 01/25/2006,"Great Car, but no EVO",4,"The 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer O-Z Rally is an absolutely great and economic car to purchase, but do not expect high performance.  It's a little above average in handling and comfort, but without ABS, traction control, and more than 120 horsepower - it is lacking.  I love it and wish I was a mechanic because I would do an engine swap."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Raul O, 02/03/2006,"70,000 Milles and still very happy!",4,"I have had my Mitsubishi Lancer for three years now, driving from Miami to New York, trailering my 850 pounds jet ski to the bay all weekends and the car still is like new condition. The only repairs that I have done besides oil changes, change spark plugs, filter and alignment, have been to replace the spark plug wires.  I am really happy with the reliability of this car. It has a lot of space, is strong enough to pull the jet ski or a boat off the ramp on the weekends, and has good interior space.  I am 6'2"" and fit perfectly and comfortably in the car. Thus far my Lancer has been a very dependable car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,drepp77, 03/07/2003,Excellent Car indeed,4,"The handling for this car is amazing. 
Comparable to that of a high end BMW. 
The turning radius (as almost every 
review has said) is the best of any 
auto of its class and those two 
combined have gotten me out of several 
tight spots in both driving and parking 
in nyc. LACK OF POWER is driving me to 
get the evo 7 coming out next week, but 
my current Lancer is outstanding 
nonetheless."

most comfortable car I've ever been in. 
That's because the seats Mitsubushi 
buys have been hands down awarded the 
most comfortable. I drive 365 miles one 
way every weekend, in any other car 
I've ever been in it would be 
unbearable. But I can't complain with

We're about to trade it in with 78,000 miles and when the salesman took it for a spin, he was shocked and felt that the car still drove like it was new. Quick. Responsive. Corners like a cat. We had a stick, so we juiced out more power by learning how to balance the clutch to take off at a light. Nice body shape- when I wash it- I still get compliments. Huge trunk.  I think Mitsubishi found it's Civic in the Lancer OZ Rally.  I'll miss it dearly."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Mikey the 4th, 04/26/2005,What a Car!,5,"I love this car's gas mileage. It's labeled at 28/35 mpg but I have been averaging 30/38mpg. But I guess it depends on how you drive the car. The horsepowe isn't that great but for being a light car the horsepower doen't matter too much. If it does for you, then go buy an EVO. I haven't had any engine or any other problems with it at all and I have 43K miles on it. One thing I have to say if you buy it is to put on some high perfromance tires. It drives smoother, quieter, and you get better gas too. Not much but enough. The interior is nice and simple, plenty of room interior, exterior, and engine to deck out. Mitsubishi + OZ-Rally = Awesome!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Randy G, 08/04/2005,Great Car no Go,4,"I really love my car - Lancer OZ, but the engine is what it lacks.  I've added a Injen Cold Air Intake, MagnaFlow Cat-Back Exhaust, B & M Short Shifter, Denso Iridium Plugs, Carbon Fiber Dash Kit, and a huge stereo system.  I only wish it had 200 hp.  Gotta recommend it though, grew up a Ford guy and switched to Japanese vehicles for better quality, less recalls, etc.  No problems 3 years and 45,000 miles later."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Missy, 01/31/2006,Perfect Car,5,I'm definitely a poor college student...but this car saves me some cash.  It is totaly awesome.  It only takes about $23 to fill up and it is so cute.  People always wanna race me!
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,jim, 06/03/2007,Outstanding gas mileage!,4,"34.5 MPG on a regular basis. No kidding. 106,000 miles. Awesome car. No maintenance other than suggested/standard stuff. Only one item has broken/worn out: the switch for the AC/heat temperature. That's it! Definite, high quality car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Dimitry, 06/14/2007,Overall is a good car,4,"I bought it used 1.5 years ago. In general, I am very satisfied - it has 65,500 and is still very reliable. City mileage is not great. I get only about 20 mpg, but on a highway its about 35-37 mpg. I did only general maintenance and changed the belts - at 60K they started to develop cracks (not timing belt yet). "
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Hizzank, 03/07/2002,Hank awaits the EVO VII,4,"So far, I've had zero problems with the car, it's great."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Slipperywhenwet, 03/12/2003,Great car on dry surfaces,4,"This is a great vehicle for only 17k 
dollars.  The only beef i have is with 
the extreme lack of power.  The 
transmission does not have any kick to 
it, it merely slides into gear when the 
pedal is to the metal.  Also if the 
ground is the slightest bit wet, grab 
ahold because the car will feel like it 
hit an icepatch.  The car is good on 
gas and very reliable.  I will be 
changing the tires shortly hopefully 
that will cause the car to stop sliding 
as much."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,rhannah, 03/11/2002,Great car for its class,4,"I love the car so far, it handles well, it's spunkier than the reviews give it, it has a fantastic roomy & classy interior too. I don't feel like I own a compact ""economy"" car at all. I also have yet to see one in my city, which makes it feel even more unique, instead of the dozens of Hyundias running around."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,nufftrouble, 03/11/2002,its aight,3,"I have the oz and i find for it being the top line of the car models they could have at least given it more horsepower or made the rims 16'. The car lacks power and has bad handling. This car has so much restrictions on it. Its a good car for the price but with the name lancer they should put whats known in lacers, horsepower"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,BRUCE, 10/12/2002,THE BEST THERE IS,5,"I HAVE OWED MY LANCER 11 MONTHS. I HAD 
BEEN SHOPPING FOR A NEW VEHICLE FOR A 
FEW MONTHS. I HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE 
CHRYSLER, JEEP, VW, EVEN FORD. BUT WHEN 
I SAW THAT CAR SITTING ON THE SHOW ROOM 
FLOOR IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SITE. I TEST 
DROVE IT AND THAT IS ALL IT TOOK I HAD 
TO HAVE THAT CAR. EVER SINCE IT HAS 
BEEN THE BEST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER HAD. 
I HAVE HAD A CHEVY, DODGE, JEEP, AND A 
VW AND THERE IS NO COMPARISON THIS CAR 
IS SO GREAT. IT HAS EVERYTHING I WANTED 
AND THE PRICE I WAS SO SHOCKED THAT IT 
WAS SO CHEAP. I AM SO HAPPY WITH MY CAR 
THAT SOMETIMES I JUST LIKE TO GET IN IT 
AND DRIVE FOR THE FUN OF IT."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,MistyKin, 03/20/2002,I love this car!!!,4,"I got this car and the only thing i can find that bothers me about it is that i cant figure out how to use 
the climate controls correctly the air only goes off if the little orange light is 
on is that a glitch?"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,rallyrally, 03/30/2008,great car!,4,All in all this is a great car. Good gas mileage and fun to drive especially when every one thinks your an Evo or something. Inside is simple nothing catchy but easy to use and comfortable. Sound system is great! This car is safe too! I wrecked it and the only thing wrong with it is the body! Ill miss this car!
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,ParCh, 03/21/2002,Lancer,5,"For $1,500 less than civic LX, we got a care which well equipped and fun to drive. Good power and fuel economy, nice interior and exterior and fun to drive. very happy with it specially since it was selected as best pick in crash test."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,ChiBob, 03/22/2002,Happy and Satisfied,4,"Stylish, nice build. Not ubiquitous like a Civic or Corolla, so it stands out, at least for now. Roomy interior with great ergonomics. Seats are a little hard, but support is good. Lot's of great standard features. And again, build quality is superb."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,ethan, 03/22/2002,My car's better than yours,4,"overall this car is pretty good for the price tag even though they mimic the rally car
but only put the engine of a civic into it.  The ride is smooth but the clutch needs
alot of work.  My suggestion would be to rent one if you can find one and drive it for
a week before buying one, still though i would i get just as many options on this as i 
would a civic ex or corolla le, but i only paid $15,500, those two are asking almost
$20,000 for the same thing! Wake up and drive honda and toyota this car is better
in every way."
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Chrisguy, 03/25/2002,car,5,My first car. And also the best I've ever driven.
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,Squirrelly Rascal, 03/25/2002,not too shabby,4,"people seem to slam this car in its performance. Two of my friends have cvics, and as far as I'm concerned this car is more fun to drive, and at least as peppy. I paid 16.5K and compared to the civic, golf, etc I think it fares well, sure more power would be great, but lets not forget the great interior, ride quality, check it out"
mitsubishi,lancer,2002,LYN TRAVIS, 03/28/2002,Positive experience,4,"After driving what seemed like every car in town, I bought the OZ Lancer because of it's great combination of sporty style and pure practicality. At 6 foot 2 inches tall, I found the interior to fit better than most of the competition. styling is sporty without being to over the top at least in white. The interior is very functional and sporty with all the necessary amenities. This car handles well and has really good ride. The adaptive automatic transmission does a great job of agreeing with your driving style.I would probably not buy this car if you are looking for real performance car but if your looking for a little pizazz without giving up any practicality, this is the car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,imanilove, 07/13/2012,"200,000 miles and still rolling smooth",3,"I'm a second owner, I had this car for over 6 years now. This car has been through the ringer and has been dogged out. Like most cars some issues have arisen such as the tie rods, and timing belt which I think is quite normal for a car with 200,000 miles. Other than that I just kept up on regular with oil changes and it's still riding strong. I would recommend a lancer to anyone looking for a long lasting car. It's certainly not a luxury car but it's a damn good car. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,jen, 08/28/2010,Watch for the heater/air switch,4,"I seen a review above me about the heater knob not turning to air conditioning. So I decided to chime in. I had the same issue and so did all 3 of my friends who own the same year lancer. Never on recall and they refused to fix it. 3k was the estimate. I traded it in this year got 2,200 trade because of the knob. It also had issues with the timing belt I had to replace it 2x's under 100k. Transmission started slipping at 90k. Lighted mirror cover broke off.  Don't let me deter you. Im sure some of that wear and tear was my fault. Light bulbs burned out quite often watch for water under hood. Drives beautifully in snow. Drove through snow storm, 1 ft deep snow and icy wipers and all."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,ashleemays, 09/11/2014,GREAT CAR!,4,"I've had my Lancer for over a year and so far I've loved it, it has only broke down on me one time the camshaft sensor went out than my battery went out but other than that it's been a great car. I did notice that people have been saying that they had problems with the temperature knob I have too ever since I bought the car!  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,ryans93, 02/20/2012,Great Car,4,"We have owned the Lancer since it was new and it has been a fantastic car. It still looks great, gets good gas mileage, is fun to drive, and little has gone wrong with it. The build quality is excellent and the interior has held up extremely well with almost no rattles and still tight after 9 years and 150k. Other than regular maintenance, few problems have arisen on the car, and it's been very reliable."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Mitsufreak, 11/13/2002,Its a okay car,2,"The Lancer is a okay car, it lacks in 
power, design, interior, and some 
other things, but it saves alot of gas"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Juan Rodriguez, 08/30/2009,Best 4 Cyl Car,4,"I've had this car for over 4 years now and I burn it up. Its 6 years old and it has the mileage of a 10 year old car and its still driving like a car of the year. Let me tell you, I floor it a lot too and this car has had no problems. Overall, the Lancer has made me stick to Mitsubishi pride. My next car, which won't be soon since my baby's still kicking, will definitely be another Lancer. :)"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Brad, 11/13/2009,Very surprising car!,4,"I've had this car for about three years now, and no problems. It is very comfortable, though road noise is a bit high. Performance in city driving is great, but needs a bit more ability passing on the highway. Very nimble, takes turns quickly and easily, the most fun part of the car! Had a Cavalier, immediately impressed by the handling of this car which, for a lower price, replaces that trailing rear axle with a great multi-link suspension that hugs the road and handles the bumps. Note: my car was originally sold in Guam, and instead of the 2.0L SOHC 4- valve has a 1.6L 16V SOHC. This changes the torque a bit, for some reason I get peak torque of 130ft/lbs but at 3000 rpm not 4250. Kinda nice!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Bkuhns, 12/30/2009,Till The Wheels Fall Off,5,I bought my car in April of 2008 after getting rid of my jetta (which was a lemon). This car is a terrific car to own! I have taken it on many roadtrips and it has no problems. My friends always have me drive cause they love to ride in it. It has amazing handling and it has some speed to it. For awhile I got bored of it and was thinking of selling it until I went and washed my car and I fell in love with it again. I live in Colorado and it handles great in the snow. This is definitely a car a buy.
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Cleveland, OH,My Lancer,3,"I bought this car used with 33,000 miles on it in June of 2004.  It is now the end of 2009.  The first 100,000 miles were okay, I had two recalls that I had to get taken care of and it's a good thing my mechanic is honest and told me it was a recall to call the dealership, one of the parts alone was almost $1000.  Well, now the last six months I've had the entire front end replaced, ignition coil, alternator, and the catalytic converter replaced.  The parts on this car are outrageous.  I will not buy a Mitsubishi again.  I bought a foreign car figuring I wouldn't need to replace these things before 150,000. Due to the cost of parts I might actually buy an American car!! "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,DR4eva, 11/14/2010,Happy with my Lancer!,4,"I bought a second hand Lancer ES from Dixie Mitsubishi for a great deal and ""AS IS"". Few things I had to fix were the tie rod, the lower bumper had a crack probably from a speedbump, new tires, and new brake pads.. nothing out of the ordinary!  Overall the ride is very smooth and humble. It doesn't roar like a mustang but it is quick to respond and drives very nice. My dad was equally impressed with the quality of parts (he works on our cars a lot) and I will buy Mitsubishi again!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,E-Bar, 11/23/2006,"Good Car, but Kinda Boring!",4,"I've had nothing but luck with my Lancer OZ, however after three years I am kinda bored with it.  It gets great gas mileage (27-33 mpg) and has had no mechanical problems.  It does eat tires and front brakes, I don't drive out of control or use heavy breaks.  I live in the country and don't do a lot of stop and go driving.  I wish that I had more room to haul things and passenger room.  I am 5'10"", however having somewhat tall people in my car is a problem.  For a good little commuter this is a perfect car.  For someone looking to start a life and a family you may want to keep looking."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Tarantula, 11/16/2010,Great first car I must say!,4,"Bought it about 7 months ago with 132k miles on it. Was a little skeptical about it but when I drove it, I couldn't believe its 7 years old. Great gas mileage (about 30 mpg combined), fun to drive (in short commutes but not on the highway), and great reliability. I drove like 12k miles in just six months of purchase and needed nothing other than regular oil change. There is some room for improvement such as, temperature knob is hard to rotate and I'm not the only one facing this, no abs/cruise. But other than these issues the car is great. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,wolfcry, 01/18/2014,a great bang for your buck,4,"I've had this for a year now, bought it used with about 130k miles. Very few issues with this car... I've mostly just had to do the regular oil changes, but I've also had to change a power window motor and rail, tie rod ends.

Gotta change the bushings on the control arms later, and replace the window tint since its kinda messed up right now; not saying that all Lancers gotta change their window tint, mine was bought with some small defects in the all of the window tint..."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,mpeters@niu.edu, 12/23/2002,Great Car & 0 Payments for a year.,5,"I bought this car in November 02, and 
I love it.  The interior quality is 
excellent, better then others in it's 
class.  Ride on the highway is smooth, 
and handles great.  Over all excellent 
quality, and a great value."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,gil, 01/12/2016,RUN BABY RUN,5,"Runs good. Keeps you moving.
"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,LancerCO, 02/17/2010,Amazing car,4,I bought my Lancer OZ Rally in April of 07 with 93000 miles on it and since then i have put on 30000 miles on it. I love driving this car in the summer and winter (as long as there is no snow). The Lancer struggles on snow and ice because it is so light. Overall though I love this car and plan on driving it until the wheels fall off. You won't be sorry you bought this car.
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Leslie, 03/08/2010,I love my car!,4,"I've only had this car for a few months, but so far, I love it!  The first owner of the car maintained it perfectly, so maintenance has not yet been an issue on this 78K mile vehicle.  Based on some of these reviews, my opinion might change once major work is necessary, but so far the car is wonderful, and the best I've ever owned.  It's fun to drive, handles well, and has enough zip to pass whenever I need to.  I'm planning to drive this car for years to come.  I'm a careful driver, and keep up on suggested maintenance, and don't see any problems in the near future.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,res, 11/22/2010,Still pleased,4,My wife and i bought this car with 11 miles on the odometer. Great feeling.8 years later we are almost at 60k. This car is mostly driven by my wife.We use to use for long trips and am surprised to hear people have gotten up to 30 mpg on the highway. I have seen consistent 25 mpg on highway. Anyway this is a great little car that is nimble but lacks a little power.
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,//Scrypt, 12/10/2002,Fun Commuter,4,"The OZ Rally may look like its Rally
cousin, but is more distant than its
appearance and name may suggest.  If you
are expecting a sports car, look
elsewhere.  If you are looking for an
economical commuter that looks good and
is fun to drive, this is your car!  Its
quiet, roomy, smooth, predictable, and
comfortable."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,GoSuperMatt, 12/13/2002,In general,5,"Over-all this is the best compact on 
the market. Outstanding Gas milage (28-
32 is what I'm getting) 
Interior/Exterior quality is far 
better then any other car in it's 
class,  Drove off the lot with 
39miles, and I'm at 11,000.  the ride 
is smooth & quiet. Horsepower even in 
the mountains was better then 
expected, (after reading negative 
feedback on some reviews)Great 
financing available the 0-0-0 sales 
event A friend of mine just got a 2003 
Corolla, and paid almost $3,500 more 
then I did, and the interiors are 
layed out the same, except the Lancer 
has more room in the rear, and a 
higher quality apearence."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,ozlancernut, 01/17/2003,Value for money,5,"I have brand new yellow OZ-Rally 
Lancer . Inspiration on top! Every 
driver on a road looking on this 
beauty, breaking his or her necks! 
Tinted windows, OZ-racing rims, all 
body spoilers, and this car is fast, 
believe me. You only have to try smooth 
short manual transmission shifts. It's 
like a poem. Racing sound pleases your 
hart on 4000 rpm. The only issue 
tracking is bad! I mean really bad, my 
tires loose tracking when I force a 
car, even on strait road. Wanna more? 
AirIntake will improve performance for 
another dosen hp, for only 200 bucks. 
For my opinion it is the best car you 
can get on this price."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Mark F, 01/17/2003,Great Buy,5,"The Lancer is a great car for the 
money.  Plenty of interior room, 
especially in the back seat where many 
small cars are too tight for adults or 
even for kids in car seats. Back seat 
is very easy to get in and out of. The 
ride is also very smooth and quiet but 
still with good, predictable handling.  
The engine is very smooth for a big 4-
cylinder and has plenty of power for 
moving about in daily traffic.  The 
cruise control is nice because its too 
easy to exceed the speed limit in this 
car if your not careful."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Bill22x, 02/14/2003,LancerLS,4,"I bought my Lancer in October and I 
love it.  So far I haven't had any 
problems and the gas mileage has been 
great. Especially with my driving style
(had license less than a year)."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Kid Lancer 7, 09/13/2003,The Lancer Rocks!,4,"I've been a fan of the mitsubishi 
Lancer / evolution series for a long 
while.  I felt i just had to own one.  
VERY roomy for its size.  Lots of space 
in the trunk.  Very comfortable to 
drive and loads of fun. I Thought it 
could be just a tad bit faster than 
what it is.  BUt with some basic 
Modifications, this thing will tear up 
the road!   Great car if u don't like 
Honda Civics (like myself!).  Id 
recommend this to anyone 18-29 yrs old, 
Anyone that wants to customize an 
import car, or any one that wants an 
excellent car, with out spending a a 
fortune!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,rod, 09/21/2006,Better Than Expected,4,"My 2003 Lancer was purchased used at an ""auto superstore"" in 03/2004 with 15,212 miles, for $9,988.  It replaced my 1998 Nissan Altima which had 217,000 miles and a fantastic service record, i.e., minimal problems and great fuel economy.  My expectations for the Mitsubishi were ""OK"" at best, I did not believe that it was in the same league as the Nissan.  iIwas wrong!  I am a medical courier and as of 9/20/2006 i have 200,867 miles on this little cracker-box car.  I change the oil (and filter of course) about every 5,000 miles, use only regular (87 octane) gas as recommended, and change spark plugs about every 30,000 miles using only the recommended ngk's (don't make the mistake I did by using other plugs)."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,tuner77, 11/03/2006,With Help...a Great Little Car,4,"I purchased my manual 2003 O-Z Lancer new in Dec. of 2002 and have 52,000 miles on it.  The only problem I have noticed is a delay in staring in the summer months...due to the higher concentration of ethanol in the gas.  It has no problems when driving, just starting.  I put in NGK Iridium plugs a few months back and that seemed to have corrected that.  If your not having the problem, I would not recommend those plugs, they are too expensive and the gain is minimal. Mostly though the car is a great everyday driver.  Comfort-wise, it's a very good deal for the money.  Its performance is lacking, but with the help of the automotive aftermarket and a $1,000 investment, anyone with a tool set can remedy that."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Kaitai, 01/13/2003,My Lancer,4,"Great little economy car, its not a hot 
rod, but has loads of room, is fun to 
drive and skips the gas station like 
the plague. Drove the Civic, Focus, 
Protoge and the Sentra, picked this 
becasue it had more room and just felt 
like it had more spunk, while being 
very quiet on the inside."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,asa0526, 01/16/2003,Good Car,4,"So far, have driven the vehicle for 
1000 miles... mostly highway driving 
up/down mountains and through city 
traffic.
The car is a pleasant surprise for me.
Good acceleration ... low revving, 
excellent ergonomics, excellent 
interior room, comfortable ride."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Mystery, 06/17/2003,Mitsubishi Lancer,4,"I have to tell you that at this time 
last year, I would have told you I 
would rather walk than drive in a 
Mitsubishi.  After my truck got broken 
into, and the rental company gave me 
this car, I wasnt too thrilled.  But 
after I started it up and drove it for 
a little while, I started to change my 
mind.  I love this car. As soon as the 
rest of my money is saved, I am getting 
the brand new Lancer. The turns in this 
car is unbelievable. Thank You 
Mitsubishi!!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,ryan ward, 06/29/2003,8.8,4,"this car is a really fun car to drive, 
its smooth, quiet,and it handles well. 
yes the engine is not that fast, but it 
is not the slowest car out there. the 
car is stylish and i think that it is 
diffrent than most of the cars in its 
class. though the jetta and the mazda 6 
are better overall cars, for the money, 
the lancer is a really good buy."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,souren, 07/26/2003,Thank you for bringing it to the states,5,"The lancer is a great car!  I think we 
should have had the car here in the 
states a long time ago.  It out-
preforms the civic,  sunfire, cavelier, 
sentra, focus and many other cars in 
its class.  There is a big aftermarket 
parts market for the lancer!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Toyota Fan, 01/16/2003,No More Mitsus 4 Me,3,"Hello there: I owned my 2002 Lancer a 
total of five months to the day. Its 
cold-start piston slap noise was so bad 
a co-worker actually called out he 
wasn't aware they were available with 
Diesel engines. The paint job was 
orange peeled, the brakes began 
squealing at approximately 5000 miles 
(70% of my commute is highway) and a 
leaking antifreeze odor had begun when 
I traded it in on a Toyota Echo."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,John, 11/17/2008,2003 Lancer ES,2,"This car is somewhat fun to drive. However, just pray that nothing goes wrong. Even a minor problem can be very expensive to fix. The reason is the car is constructed in modules, like a lego set. If one little piece of the module breaks, you have to replace the whole thing. For example, the plastic door on the heating duct got warped. (This is a small plastic piece that moves to switch you from cool air to hot air.) Cost to fix: $3000 because the entire heating/air conditioning module had to be replaced. My mechanic told me the same problem would have cost $100 to fix on a Honda."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,colembaw, 12/01/2005,Well....I guess I like it,4,"I like my Lancer, but I think that it is a little average. The fuel economy is OK, the ride is OK, I don't want to come across as an unsatisfied customer, but I just haven't been blown away by the car. The interior is above average, I like the standard features, but overall I haven't been thrilled with the pick-up or the way that I have been followed up with by the dealership (none). Being a car salesman now, I look back on the experience I had and see how to not sell a customer a car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Lancer Hater, 07/30/2003,Stay Away,1,"This is the worst car I have ever 
owned. At 35,000 miles I already needed 
a new clutch.  At 37,000 miles I needed 
new brake pads, shocks and struts, a 
new piston, new timing belt and a new 
head gasket.  Since I am so upside down 
on the car because of 
Mitsu's ""wonderful"" no 
payments/interest for 1 year, I had no 
choice but to fix everything totaling 
over $2200.  Do not buy this car!!!! 
You would be better off driving a Kia.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,kewl kid, 12/18/2002,Not bad at all- well... a little!,3,"I would recommend a Honda Civic or a 
Hyundai Elantra also!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,PT, 05/10/2003,Good car,4,"Got this car in January and chose this 
over the Mitsubishi Eclipse because of 
handling and fuel economy. The car 
hasnt let me down yet and it appears 
it wont. This car is manufactured 
actually in Japan unlike the civic 
which is made in the good ole' USA and 
the sentra which is assembled in 
Mexico. So this is actually an import 
with japanease quality."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,2003 Lancer, 06/24/2008,Dissatisfied,3,"I've had my 03 Lancer for 5 years now, and I only have 40,600 miles on it. Just recently the Horn-Pad assembly stopped working, is malfunctioning. Because it is connected with the airbags and steering component, I have to get the entire component replaced, which has cost me over $1200. Another unfortunate thing is that the part is not made in the U.S. The part had to be placed on backorder from Japan - not too happy about that!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Laura, 07/01/2008,Some problems,3,"I've had this car for two years and I do put a lot of miles on it annually.  It ran great initially, but since I hit 90,000 miles I've had to put about $2,000 in to repairs.  front and rear axle, exhaust system, break pads and shoes 3-4 times in the last two years, transmission, etc.  It is also extremely loud, the external noise I can hear with the windows rolled up is kind of ridiculous.  It is extremely comfortable to sit in and fun to drive but not worth it anymore.  Also, as I work in a city and have to parallel park, my car gets bumped around a lot be less contentious drivers.  The thing dents as easily as a soda can!  There's a dent from someone having leaned against it!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Jules, 10/01/2008,Reliable,4,"I bought my 03 Lancer ES new.  I drive to work 33 miles one way mostly highway miles and average about 31 - 34 miles per gallon.  I love my little car.  It is a five speed and handles great in the winter snow.  The only maintenance I have done is change the oil, had the belts changed at 100,000. I just had my spark plugs changed at $115,000, you think the dealer would have told me every 30,000 miles for the plugs, since that is where my oil changes are done.  I have never had a more reliable car. It still runs like new."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Ricardo, 11/21/2008,Great Car,4,"I really enjoy this car. I have not had any problems at all and I drive this car a lot. The only maintenance is oil change and things of that sort which I do my self. One more thing to add, this car has no axles."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,garlinghouse, 04/15/2009,A car that adapts to your life,4,"My Lancer ES was my first new car. Being young and immature I drove it like a rally car the first 10k miles of its life. As I got more responsible and mature I began driving it normally. After getting married and having 2 kids it made a great family car. My wife now uses it everyday to make long commutes to work and school driving at least 150 miles a day. This car still gets great gas mileage around 27mph average, has never let me or my family down even at 80k plus miles. This car can take anything you or your life throw its way. All it asks in return is follow its maintenance schedule by the book and this car will do whatever you need it to do.... within reason! Highly recommended."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,LancerGuy2003, 07/13/2009,A good solid car,4,"This was my first new car. Mostly the first 5 years or so no real problems with it. I have had some big expenses starting at the fifth year mark (65K miles). Still all in all, not bad. My mileage has been on the high side (26-28 city, 32-34 highway). It's at 94K and hoping to keep it around for another 40K or so. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,steve, 08/31/2010,Disappointing,3,"The vehicle itself is not a bad vehicle to own, low in perchance cost, easy to maneuver, and sporty looks tribute to its appeal. After owning this vehicle for a little while I find myself disappointed, the ride is quite bouncy, the engine is underpowered, and the fuel economy is nothing to write home about, I would say just below par for its class. The front is nice and grippy when you do get up to speed, sadly cornering fun is reduced by moderate body lean. If one is looking for a lancer oz rally my suggestion would be to find one with a manual transmission. As an automatic, a very good first car, looks good, is cheap to own and maintain, yet for the parents its not crazy fast."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,geralt, 12/21/2002,Simply superlative,5,"I have this car for three monts, and absolutly love it.
Have driven numerous small cars and 
none compare to this one. Room, ride, 
handling are outstanding.
Fun car with plenty of speed for your 
average driver.
Reliability is flawless, proven by 
German TUV. Lancer beats even a Mercedes 
and BMW. Have not had any problems at 
all with this car and would buy another 
in a second. Maybe even EVO VII."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,dkh5a, 12/23/2002,Like the Car,3,"I boughth this car as a cheap 4-door 
car that got decent gas mileage because 
of my commute. It has lived up to all 
of those expectations and ""knock-on-
wood"" has been the most reliable car I 
have ever had."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Rasputin, 12/30/2002,Worth a look,4,"I bought the Lancer after looking at
other cars in its class and settled on
it because nobody else had one, and the
price was right. After a test drive in
an OZ I loved it. It's only got 120 HP
but the torque's in the low-end of the
band so you can actually use it. Anybody
who complains it needs more power really
forgets that for a car that starts at
about $14,000 you're looking at an
econobox. This isn't to say that the
Lancer doesn't have potential; there's
plenty to be had if you're willing to
pay. Milage has been a steady 27 MPG on
my stick, and I've been very happy with
the car. The look and feel of the car
are great. Check it out if you're in the
entry-level market."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,keithu, 01/02/2003,Underappreciated compact car,4,"We looked for a good compact car and 
that is exactly what we found. The 
interior is sized like a mid-size 
sedan; adults are comfortable in the 
front or back. The trunk holds camping 
gear for a family of four. Fuel economy 
is in the low 30s highway, upper 20s in 
town. I think the Lancer gets a bad rep 
for performance, given the flashy 
exterior of the OZ Rally Edition. While 
it is not a true performance car it 
handles reasonably well and has plenty 
of power for passing on rural two-lane 
roads where we drive most. The car is 
100% reliable and easy to maintain."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Fer, 01/03/2003,Better than I thought,4,"Very good fuel economy. Easy to drive 
and comes with a powerfull enough 
engine. Transmission is very smooth. 
Its a little bit noisy at high speed. 
Comes with many options. Excellent 
financing options plus a 3 year bumper 
to bumper."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,asa0526, 01/06/2003,Not Excellent but Good,3,"The Lancer is not as refined as the 
2001 Sentra (engine/road noise, plush 
materials). Lot like the Honda and 
Protege in terms of refinement but a 
small notch below both in terms of 
quality of materials. The Protege has 
larger HVAC controls - and better 
plastic. Interior space wise, this car 
is the roomiest. Gas mileage - right 
now I am averaging 32 mpg - 90% 
highway."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,scopla, 01/07/2003,Excellent Car,4,"I just bought a Lancer O-Z 5 speed and 
I'm very impressed with it. And for 
everyone who says the mirage has power 
and the lancer doesn't, check the 
specs. It's the same engine!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Geralt, 01/09/2003,The best small sedan,4,"The best small car to drive. Handling, fun and design are outstanding.A lot of room inside.
The engine has enough power to enter 70 mph highway line and commute everyday.
Has good fuel economy and handling is awesome. You'll take 25 mph turns with 50 mph and not feel it.
Reliablitity poven by German TUV. For 5 years old cars Lancer is better then some Mercedes or BMW!
Great mitsubishi."

mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Joe Bethel, 01/20/2003,Love My Lancer,5,"I love the Lancer     of all the cars I 
have owned definately my favorite. It 
may not be the fanciest car on the 
market but for the money I spent I feel 
I got wayyyyyyy more than I paid for. 
The fuel economy is a great added bonus 
and the safety features on the vehicle 
are great. I even saw where the NHSA 
just picked it as the safest car they 
tested which only made me feel better 
about having my wife and baby boy 
riding in the car everyday."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,optimasone, 01/22/2003,What I think of the O-Z Rally Lancer,5,"The Lancer is overall a fun car to 
drive. It offers more passenger volume 
than a lot of other cars in it's class. 
It does need a little extra pep, but no 
more than other cars in it's class. 
It's great on gas mileage and very 
economical overall with all it's 
standard features."

mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Anez2, 01/23/2003,My Lighting Yellow Lancer,5,"I'm not interested in what the reviews 
say, because they are other cars out 
there like a so called ""Focus"" that 
keeps having recalls. Anyhow, I love 
driving my Lancer! It's like driving a 
family car with a little attitude, 
because of the yellow coloring. Of 
course i don't have any kids of my 
own, but there is more roomy seating 
for three car seats. Also it was 
affordable, I always had to look to 
compact cars, not anymore! My car the 
lighting can catch up to speed quick, 
I know because Ive stayed close to 
side of a Subaru WRX. You can either 
make it look like a family car or a 
car for show. Either way its better 
than the Mirage."

become more popular than the Civic."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,lisnun, 09/15/2003,I love my Lancer!,4,"I purchased my Lancer in February of 
2002. The reason for my low mileage is 
because I only drive it to and from 
work and occasionaly elsewhere. I love 
everything about it, except the fact 
that it is only a 2 cylinder. 
The ""pickup"" could be better only 
because it is very slow while going up 
hills. I have to get up to 45mph to get 
to 40 mph! That is the only thing I can 
say that I am not happy with. As far as 
everything else goes, I think it is an 
excellant car for me!!"

option on it, but most came standard
(AC,poer window, power locks, cruise
control,variable wipers delays...) the
sun roof is great, and works smoothly.
The rear seats easily accomodate full
grown adults! I have been in some mid
size cars where fitting in the back is a
tight squeeze.

then put rims on it, oz floor mats and

fond of the wing or the front grill.

I actually traded in my 1999 Honda EX

the Lancer style long before it was 
released in the US, the body lines are 
unique, which is what I like. 
    The lancer actually surprised most 
of my friends with the ability to push 
you into the seat off the line. It has 
been reported to have 120 hp, it seems 
like it has more hp that most cars in 
its class.
     I am 6'7"" tall and 250 lbs and the 
lancer is very comfortable."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,D.W. Stones, 07/06/2006,Good car!,4,The Lancer's standard equipment is great not cheap and flimsy like in some of the domestic cars I've had.  This car is fun to drive and can take the numerous potholes of the roads of PA with out jolting you around like a you're riding in a dryer on four wheels unlike my old Subaru. More than 120 horses would make it a little bit more exciting to drive.
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Drew, 07/08/2006,An OK alternative,3,"I bought my Lancer used, with about 36,000 miles on it. It's been a solid performer so far, but it should be for the first 100,000 miles. Any car should. The car should have more horsepower. There's no reason it shouldn't be in the 160-170 HP range when the Rally version is well over 200. The gas mileage is disappointing, it too should be better. I've experience high 20s when traveling on the highway - it should be in the mid-30s at least. All in all, the Lancer is a half-way decent alternative if you cannot afford the Civic or a comparable Toyota or Nissan. My only other concern would be the automatic transmission. I hope it doesn't give out before it's paid for. Go with a stick if you can."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,novbec, 04/23/2004,GLAD I DID IT,4,"I purchased my Lancer brand new. I

I LOVE that car. Granted, its' not the 
fastest car on the block, but it's 
pretty darn zippy, and I have no 
problems getting on the highway at a 
highway speed or faster.  I havent had 
the opportunity to take it to the 
mountains to see how it does (in 
colorado).It gets great gas mileage 
30-31 mpg combined. I really couldnt 
ask for anything more for the price 
except anti-lock brakes. The car comes

AND DRIVE IT TO WORK EVERYDAY.  IT GETS
AROUND 32MPG. I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED BIG
CARS WITH POWER, AND DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO
EXPECT FROM A SMALLER CAR, BUT SO FAR
I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED. MECHANICALLY, THIS
IS AN EXCELLENT AUTOMOBILE. I CURRENTLY 
HAVE 51,000 MILES ON THE ODOMMETER. I 
HAVE CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES 
AND HAVE SCHEDULED MY FIRST TUNE-UP 
NEXT WEEK.   "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Mikeandstuff, 03/11/2003,GREATEST CAR EVER!!!!!!!!,5,"this is the best car ever built. its 
comfortable,convenient, and just plain 
fun to drive. it hardly ever needs to 
go to the shop (other than oil changes)
and it's very reliable aswell. my 
lancer has great fule economy and 
accelorates like nothing else.(no 
engine work has been done) it handles 
great to. it turnes as if it was on 
rails. it can take a corner better than 
my old 1999 accord could."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,John, 06/03/2005,Ups and Downs,4,"I love my Lancer OZ but she has been a headache.  Note to drivers:  do not get into an accident.  After an accident and the car has no value left to it and the problems are irrepairable.  It still drives like a dream with 50,000 miles but it has noises like you wouldn't beleive.  Horrible in the snow and rain but on nice days, handels and zips like a dream."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,lancerchic, 06/03/2005,I love it!,5,"I have loved this car from the moment I test drove it.  It is a lot of fun to drive, and I love the sporty look.  I have taken this car on all kinds of long road trips, and it has never failed me. I like the feeling that I am driving a sporty car, but that I still have 4 doors and room to fit passengers and cargo, as opposed to a 2-door sports car that you can't fit anything in besides the driver.   Highly recommended!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,TomCat, 03/15/2003,Good Japanese Car for Great Price!,4,"So far I am very pleased with my new 
Lancer!  It rides very comfortably, 
performs well for a 4-cylinder, and 
there are plenty of standard features 
for the price.  I added a color-keyed 
spoiler and tint at the dealership at 
no cost!!!  The Diamond White Pearl 
paint is beautiful!  Can't wait to go 
on a road trip."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,tebeaudin, 09/26/2006,A Great Car,4,"This car has exceeded all of the expectations I had when I purchased it.  Mitsubishi is not known for its quality, but this car is very well built.  The gas mileage has been a pleasant surprise but I haven't given up any power.  The car has quite a bit of zip that lets me hang with cars with much more power.  It has a great ride overall."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,M J.DRAHL, 11/05/2006,"Be Intelligent, Give It a Shot",4,"My spouse and I were not seeking to purchase a new vehicle on that hot humid New Jersey afternoon. As we passed the dealer I noticed the Diamond White Pearl OZ Rally from knowledge on upgrade platform outside. We just had test driven such a vehicle.  Both my wife and I took separate drives in a five speed.  We were so impressed by its handling, brakes, outward vision, and tremendously smooth gearbox 4.04.1 that we placed our down payment on one in less an hour.  The vehicle was delivered as promised in less than three days. The sales staff and management were very business-like and extremely professional in all respects. We purchased another Lancer ES for our college bound son for his NY trips."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Jr Evo, 01/24/2007,My Super Car,5,"The 2003 Lancer is a great car to modify.  A lot of people complain that it is lacks prower, but all it needs is a high flow cat and muffler and a cold air intake with light rims and ngk iridium plugs.  I'm doing 0-60 in about 5.5 seconds."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,michield, 04/03/2003,The wizard of OZ turns heads,4,"The Lancer OZ Ralley is a head turner. 
A sporty car with a youthful aroma.  
Some critics say it's under powered 
with only 120hp in a 130hp class but 
the torque at 130lbs is what you feel. 
I tested the corolla, protoge, and 
sentra before deciding on the OZ. I 
didn't find any noticable difference in 
power or acceleration when driving.  I 
suggested that if you want to turn 
heads by the OZ.  If you are more 
conventional and wish to save a few 
pennies in gas by the corolla."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,bigspender, 04/08/2003,Just another Car,2,"OK car. Drives ok and handles nice. No 
power unless someone gets out and 
pushes.  They are very proud of it as 
they MSRP the o-Z at 18,000 and the 
dealer tries to sell $2000.00 more of 
scotch gaurd and pin strip."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,Barrone, 04/17/2003,Price and Power,4,"I have been waiting for years to 
experiance that feeling I felt when I 
purchased my first car. My search 
ended with the discovery of the 
Mitsubishi Lancer. This car is much 
better equiped than other vehicles in 
its class.
    The Lancer is only a little over 
13Kwith a slew of appointments such as 
Power w,dl,m. You also get standard 
A/C power steering and 145watt cd 
player. 
   The real pleasure is getting behind 
the whel. Who cares about horse power 
and tourque ratings when this car 
nearly shoves you through the seat on 
take of, turns corners like its on 
rails and brakes on a dime. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,threetri, 09/15/2007,Good ride,5,"It's been a good car in the two and a half years I have had it.  I have only had to replace the front left strut at 26000 miles because of speed bumps and crappy roads.  I put an K&N air filter and an aftermarket exhaust on and I get 38 miles to the gallon on the freeway.  It's not the fastest car, but sure is fun to drive."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,T310, 05/13/2003,Nice car!,4,"Everything is great except the engine 
is kind of weak, but it will work 
perfect for someone who doesn't care 
much about it.

It comes with CD, power windows, power 
locks, power break, air bags, AC as 
the ""BASIC""!

I got a rear spoiler for cheap from the 
dealer...overall...this is the car for 
you if your budget is under 17000. It 
just looks cool with the spoiler!"

its class (including the far more 
powerful sports sedans) and was not 
planning on buying the Lancer.  After 
test-driving the O-Z Rally, however, I 
was sold.  The power was decent, but 
the ride was incredible.  Great 
handling, comfortable seats and a feel 
for the road trumped all the reviews I 
read.  I didn't count on the 
reliability, though.  10 months and 
20,000 miles later I've had no 
problems.  Definitely consider the O-Z."
mitsubishi,lancer,2003,DirtBrokeMillenial, 09/20/2020,:'( It wishes it was a Civic...,2,"Great MPG, Awful o2s, awful Catalytic converters,  unreliable transmissions (same issues with Chrysler's around this age, share the same platform) Slow to start, (Merging onto the highway can be stressful, you punch it and it's like you kicked it in the nuts, I've found it's best to slowly accelerate to hopefully get higher rpms out of 1-3rd gear, If you drive one of these past 100k you know what i mean, awful transmission) I will gladly admit they're good looking cars, just hard to go from a v⁶ or a vtec to this pretty terd. Not impressed performance wise, which us unfortunate because every 16 year old in a 92 civic wants to race you and unless they blow s headgasket or die youre done for..
Save yourself some heart ache and get a Honda.  That being said great first car for a kid. Slow enough so they wont get in trouble, good looking enough they might get laid lol

It's very reliable, especially for being 12 years old.. cant even tell! Its comfy inside. I love how the cup holders dont interfere with gear shift. This car is amazing on gas... amazing!! Gas is about 2.13/gallon. $5 gets us close to a half tank.. amazing. We keep up on oil change. I'm sure the timing belt will need replaced (we are at 109k) We change the oil every 3-4k and shes always running like new! We recently had our first big snow.  It had no issue turning on even at 5 degree weather. I will stick with Mitsubishi for all future purchases. I feel blessed to own this car!

I drive the hell out of this car and treat it like a work truck, engine is great and one of the best 2.4's that was built during this time. I have kept up with my regular maintenance items (oil changes, brakes, transmission flushes, etc...) and the car has been great. Good acceleration and a responsive gas pedal compared to other cars. I know people with much newer cars in this category (Nissan versa's corollas etc ) and this car is way more fun to drive. Looks like after a 136K miles i will have to change the catalytic converter. My goal is to try to get this car to 200k if it holds up. "

especially engine with noisey valve 
tappit. However, still breaking in with 
only 600 miles on odometer. Interior 
nice except poor simulated woodgrain 
dash appears scratched. Very smooth 
shifting automatic. Nice radio/CD."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Mike L, 05/26/2005,The absolute best investment!,4,When I first test drove the Lancer Ralliart I fell in love! I was in the market to buy a compact car and this one is the best of its class. I can't help but smile every time I get behind the wheel. Allthough I think red is the best color to get because of the interior the black one that I got is equally as good. I love how it picks up on the freeway and how it eats up the Civic SI on the road and at top end.  The best investment I ever made.  For its price the Ralliart with all options is the absolute best buy. And if you haven't drove one you need to because it is fun!
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,karl, 02/17/2010,Great basic car,4,"This was our fourth Mitsubishi and third from this dealer.  I needed a car to get to/from work and the Lancer ES fit the bill.  Knowing that gas could go higher in price, I had donated my truck to charity and wanted a car that would be reliable, safe, and at least double the mpg of the V8 in my truck.  After driving a variety of small cars, I went with what I knew and got the Mitsubishi and I have NEVER looked back.  I have taken it cross country twice and averaged 30.5 mpg on the highway.  With a Yakima rack, I can haul my canoe and fit 85 duck decoys in the truck and back seat too.  Sure, I get a few funny looks at the boat ramp but it doesn't break the bank to fill it either.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,pchiobro, 11/17/2013,One of the best cheap Imports to get,4,"I am currently in high school and this is my first car. I've had it for over a year and with that have driven the hell out of the car. It is an amazing car and can take a beating. I have taken my friends in it across the state many times and it's about to see it's 7th Chicago winter. I'm sure for it's time it was the best ""economy car"" to have but as the years have past, time hasn't been to gentle with it. You can get a car with better MPG as well as more hp for about the same price but you definitely shouldn't over look this mid 2000's Lancer. It of course has the best body style and is the best gen Lancer Mitsubishi has made. They messed up the newest Lancer/Evo X."

5 hours) with a 2004 Ralliart.....I 
didn't even make a payment on the

mitsubishi,lancer,2004,MitsuDriver04:-)5spd, 11/30/2003,My Lancer,4,"It's a really Good car, So far i love 
it. I have the base model (ES) and it

keyless entry, Am/Fm/Cd stereo that is 
one of the best stock car stereos i 
have ever heard."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Samira, 10/10/2009,Great First Car,4,"Overall this is an excellent beginner's car. I have owned this car for five years and before I got it, it had 17000 miles on it from a rental car company.  I haven't had any problems with it other than standard repairs (oil changes, brake pads, new tires, etc). It is almost 6 years old now and it has just under 60000 miles on it. It is completely reliable and easy to maintain on my own and I'm a do-it-yourself kinda girl without much mechanic experience.  My only complaints about this car are primarily superficial. The only thing I need to fix is the ac/heat knob bc it won't turn to heat. Read my suggested improvements (which I think got fixed in future models, the 2009s are really nice)!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Driver, 11/14/2009,Needed a Used Car,3,"I have owned over 40 cars in my lifetime.  The current economy forced sale of a newer, nicer car for this one.  Not a bad car; quick, fun, excellent handling...not bad.  I enjoy the very linear ""go-kart"" handling.  Kinda slow off the line and plug ugly.  Very plain interior.  Nice shifter, outstanding midrange punch for a NA engine, and decent mileage.  MIVEC engine provides MUCH more torque than Honda VTECH.  Low production numbers make this an exclusive car; but parts and upgrades are hard to find.  Evo owners think you're a poser for driving one...until you compare gas and insurance costs.  I like this little car - it's a fun, solid everyday driver.  Resale stinks, so plan to keep it.   "

forever. Sometimes they give problems but they are worth it. I replaced the clutch after a good time taking the hell out it. I also had change starter, clutch slave cylinder but those are things that get old, no worries."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,hanars2000, 03/29/2005,Love the Ralliart,4,I've had the car for 8 months and its  only getting better. It is tight and its handling crisp. The interior is quiet compared to all the other in its class. I drove them all before I bought the Ralliart.

no other car in its class(Nissan Sentra 
SE-R Spec V, Honda Civic Si, Ford Focus

Gas tank latch is broken, It takes 2 people to fill up/open gas latch. Passenger front window motor has cable tangled up and same with rear driver side door. I have only 2 functioning windows out of the 4. Heater control knob has broken off ""Plastic  part"" cigarette lighter has no power. My car is a dream to drive in the winter with no heat & windows down with rain coming in on you. The trunk can only be open by latch, key is useless in the winter trunk will not open. WOW what a car!"

ride.  We also have a Hyundai Elantra 
which is okay, but the Lancer is a 
quantum leap above the Hyundai.  I know 
of no other car that gives you this 
fine a car for the price.  We paid 
$4,500 under the sticker price."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,donnat, 09/27/2004,Not Too Pleased,2,"The absolute WORST thing about this car 
is that both front doors make an awful 
rattling noise when you shut them. I'm 
told that it'll cost me $100 just to 
look at them...then the price keeps 
going up from there. Also, the paint 
job is HORRIBLE! I've never seen so 
many little scratches on a car of mine.
(Guess that's because I always had a 
Toyota).My bottom line is ...I can't 
see what all my teen's friends see in 
it. I guess they like the commercials."

A salesman tells me to get out after testing two cars, had a argument with him and their manager and will never buy another car from there again, period. I love the power in this car but after a while the car starts squeaking. Replaced front sway links and tie end rods then later, rear sway links, struts, and bushings. Parts that were used to replace were practically junk. Just recently replaced brake pads and now the car starts rattling by wheels. Brakes were bled and installed correctly though."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,a stevenson, 09/21/2008,poor parts availability,2,What good is the warranty if you can't get the parts. The air flow sensor went on my car 2000 km out of warranty and the co. refused to assist with cost. To make matters worse I have now been 8 days with no car while we wait for the part to be shipped from the States. Mitsubishi would be the last car I would ever buy. Warranty is all smoke and mirrors. The fact that they have no parts warehouse in Canada shows they can't back there vehicles and care very little about Canadian consumers. This car was a blast to drive but will be for sale if I ever get it back.
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Barry, 06/26/2008,Great Car,5,"I bought my lancer es used for $8,000 with 42,000 miles on it and have put another 10,000 miles on it. I have not had a single problem with it and I get about 28 mpg. Its been a great car and I put about $1,000 worth of parts into it and now its awesome! People now think I'm driving a luxury car because I put nice custom leather seat covers on it, halogen headlights, a spoiler, new deck, etc. Next, I want a turbocharger and some nice wheels, and it'll be perfect. I love how you don't see too many of these cars on the road too. It's also fun to drive and has good traction for a econosedan."

I am 20 years old and in college so I need a reliable, economic, fun, inexpensive car to drive and my OZ Rally Lancer is just that!  I bought the car from a dealer and it was a one owner with a clean history and had great service records.  I have only had one issue with it and that was with the A/C and my warranty took care of that.  This car is a blast to drive and I get around 30 MPG with my spirited Driving.  I have taken it out of state, to the beach, and to the mountains and it never lets me down!  It will be with me a long time!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,StangFan247, 01/10/2008,Great car for what it is,4,"I'm really power-hungry when it comes to cars, but I got this to commute back and forth to school and work while I'm saving up for a Mustang. It is a very reliable car with great gas mileage. Of course, gas mileage and horsepower are inversely related, so I don't expect a thrill ride when I punch it. However, the little 2.0 4-cylinder does have some pep to it, and has great throttle response. (It also does some nice donuts for front wheel drive :-D). It has solid handling (impressive for economic tires and stock suspension). It tracks very well on the highway, even in the rain. The brakes are also very responsive. And even being 6-feet tall, I easily found my sweet spot in the driver seat."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,AksJay, 08/04/2009,Impressed With Lancer,4,I spent 3-4hrs a day to and from work in Chicagoland traffic and weather. I was very impressed with how it handled all of these situations. Its now 4yrs old with 121000 miles and still have not had any trouble except for tire issues which is expected with distance and weather issues. It still has same back brakes and suspension is near perfect. Very happy and will probably buy a new lancer soon. 
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,KO, 08/26/2009,Awesome Car,4,"The reason I purchased a Mitsubishi was because everyone I know has one. Best decision I have made.  My car, brand new, came out to 10,000 flat.  I am the worst person to take care of a car and considering that, my car is still in excellent condition.  I will buy Mitsubishi's until I die. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,the man colin morgan, 05/21/2010,The cheaper evo,4,"This is the only Lancer in the out of all trim to have a 2.4 L engine displacement. Not even the evo is packed that tight. The engine is out of one of Mitsubishi's SUVs and is a tough cookie to crack although it has evo parts it front wheel drive. I have mine fitted with a magnaflow performance 2.25 inch exhaust tail turbo, waist gate, blow off and piping with a custom intake. Rrm cold air intake and intercooler. Tien BASIC coil overs. Irotors performance brakes and rotors. This car although not handling as good as an evo has potential to be quicker in a quarter mile. It very responsive and I would recommend it to anyone with a hope to race"
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,big spank dogg, 12/03/2004,Great Compact!,4,"My Lancer is an awesome little car.  I opted for the base ES, 5 speed, no options, but got most of the features I wanted anyway.  This car handles very well and is a joy on mountain roads; however, the base 14-inch tires are much to small and the Yokohama rubber offers no grip in the wet.  Fuel economy has been a little disappointing (I average about 27 MPG on my 120-mile round trip commute), but I drive it hard so that's to be expected.  The Lancer is an awesome compact that beats everyone else in price as well."

but once I saw the Ralliart I was like 
I want this car.  It handles nice, 
pulls hard all the way to redline and 
I can spin the tires in 1st and 2nd 
which I like.  The seats are straight 
from the Evolution GT-A and are really 
comfortable to sit in plus they hold 
your body while taking turns really 
hard.  This is what the OZ edition 
should have been, also I like how they 
re-did the front end so it looks a 
little like the EVO.  So if you see 
this car take it for a drive and I bet

It became pretty clear that I couldn't 
fit it into my monthly budget. I was 
shown the Ralli Art. The suspension 
makes it fun to drive. A new engine 
gives it plenty of power. Also, the 
looks are really sharp. Plus, its a 
pretty unique car. I havn't seen 
anyone with one. I love the car and I 
had a smooth experience buying."

mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Herbertt, 08/27/2005,One Great Little Car!,4,"I purchased this car as an anniversary gift for my wife.  She's an immigrant who has never owned a car before.  So, I wanted her first car to be a special one.  Safety, ease of handling and parking, roominess, having good power but not too overwhelming, overall value, powered features like keyless entry, remote mirrors and such were very important features.  The Lancer LS beat the Civics, Corollas, Mazdas, Ions, Neons and Ford competitors hands down in cost, value for the buck and in standard equipment!  The competitors charge $1,000's more in options for what the Lancer LS offers as standard.  My wife loves her car and I drive it often too.  A very comfortable car, even for my 7' 3"" tall frame."

I upgraded rims and tires with 9.5lb 15""s and Falken 615 205-50-15 auto-X tires. Using a G-force meter my best 0-60 time was 6.6  I just test drove a Chevrolet Cobalt SS and the best run I could get out of that pos was 6.7. if only more people knew about this amazing little car!  The only mods that I have made to it are, Injen CAI DEI rapped headder, road race ceramic coated 2-1 down pipe with magnaflow cat and wide open muffler."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Ralliart, 09/28/2005,Compact FUN!,4,"I totally love my Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart. The power is sweet (162 HP). The suspension huges each turn. It doesn't have a lot of tunk space, however the rear seat is larger than other compacts I've been in. At first sight of the dash you think that its plain, but it works well and is easy to read (no hunting through 50+ buttoms). The seats look great and also are very comfortable. The ratings I have seen on gas mileage have been 23 (city) and 28 (highway) yet I have been recording between 25-28 (city); I even like to race to every once in a while and still get these results."

was resolved quickly and to my 
satisfaction.   I purchased my car in 
October of 2002 and the water had been 
accumulating the whole time I owned the 
car.  It was only after there had been 
a torrential rain and I heard what 
sounded like a wave pool in my dash

there was so much water in the dash. "

it's size and has plenty of legroom for 
rear seat passengers. "

I test drove a Subaru Legacy and Impreza, Saab 9-3 all great cars in their own right.  I however found it hard to beat the fun and excitement that I felt when I was behind the wheel of the Ralliart.  The price was right, the fun factor high and the gas mileage great.  It fit all that I was looking for and to think I would have overlooked it had it not been for my salesmans recommendation that I take a look at it prior to making a decision.  As the father of four year old twins it works as a family car as well as a fun everyday driver.  Thanks Mitsubishi!  "

driving car, it kind of handles like a
sports car. It turns corners quickly,
you only need a soft touch on the 
steering wheel...these points I 
like,however there is alot of noise 
that's seemingly coming from the inside 
of the dashboard, a rattatling(just as 
if, the car has a bad chest cold)of 
sorts. The sound really drives me crazy,
I took it back, 2 weeks after I got it, 
I thought something was wrong, however 
the repair  clerks said something about 
the cooling system or something makes a 
shaking sound. Anyway,that's the only
problem as of yet I have to say."

work--having a fun to drive car is an 
absolutely necessity. I previously 
owned a 2002 Lancer OZ Rally and was 
very happy with it, except in two key 
areas--engine performance and braking. 
I just purchased a 2004 Lancer Ralliart 
and could not be happier. The engine 
provides quick response from a dead 
stop and while on the road. As 
for braking, the stops are short and 
solid--the vehicle remains stable and 
straight. All in all, I am extremely 
pleased with the vehicle.  Those of you 
who like the Lancer, but require more 
power, the Ralliart is the choice."

I have had this car for about 2 years now, and have driven it really hard. The build quality is impeccable and its reliablity is outstanding.  My car handles like a race car and the more miles you put on it, the faster is gets.  Its gas mileage is reasonable considering the power and torque you get from the 4 cyl engine. I have had Toyotas and Hondas, and I feel that this Mitsubishi is just as good if not better, plus it has a 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty and free maintenence to boot.  In my opinion this is the best 4 door sports car on the road for under $20,000! "

fun to drive, has good power, decent

interior is bland as well as the 
outside. I could do without 
the ""import tuner"" wing on the trunk. 
If I had to do it again with the same 
money, I would probly get the Mazda 
3.  That car has waaay more available 
options, same power, less weight, same 
brakes, and looks like a more 
expensive euro compact.  But like I 
said, the Lancer having lackluster 
features has great interior 
ergonomics. "

even with incredibly high gas prices 
(about $1.93)I am still paying under 
$20 to fill my whole tank. My car has 
better pick up than others in its class

feel you can beat the ralliart.  I have 
drove Fords SVT Focus and a few other 
slightly more expensive economy sports 
cars, none felt as fun or solid to 
cruise around town in.  Something very 
exciting about this car is the free 
maintenance and warranty that come with

cought a screw in my tire and the

it up the next day at no cost to me."

It really performs great in traffic and 
responds well to all manuevers. I 
really am impressed with how well it 
stops and handels in wet weather. When 
I test drove it it really was the

mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Ellen, 06/06/2005,Lovin' my Lancer OZ,4,"I have never enjoyed a car so much!  This is my first brand new vehicle and well worth the cost.  Although it is not expensive as far as cars go, it looks it.  People are suprised when I tell them the cost.  The highway pick up could be a bit better, but once it gets going, it moves.  The design is pleasing to the eye.  I have received many comments from strangers, young and old alike.  It's a wonderful, sporty car!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Azza, 10/04/2005,Great Car!,5,"This car is actually used as an all- rounder and it must be said that it's an Australian version of the CH Lancer LS, it's our family car come weekend & the commuter during the week. Each day of the working week the car travels at least 130 km or around 82 miles each way to work and back, over 800 miles a week! The car is flawless in its reliability, performance and features. It's great to look at & has plenty of personality like its predecessor (a CE Lancer which we traded after a problem free 5 years and 200,000 miles / 320,000 km). We travel fairly large distances every year and appreciate the equipment, reliability & refinement that is found in these vehicles!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Chris, 01/16/2006,Glad that It Came with a Warranty,3,"We have owned our 2004 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart for two months now and its a nice car but we haven't been too pleased with it. We bought it with 12,000 miles on it and got a great deal. Unfortunately, we have already had it in for new struts, motor mounts,and the clutch is starting to shutter a bit. On top of that we only get on average 18-21 MPG with a mixture of city and freeway driving. We love the style and the handling. The power is OK."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Tunnel, 04/03/2006,Good for commuting,4,"I am not sure how I ended up with this Lancer, but I don't consider it a mistake. You can find them used very cheap. Mine has been perfectly reliable. Get the 5-speed manual, because it will remind you of its bread-and-butter nature, and, ultimately, the reason you bought it in the first place. We could all finance better cars; you don't buy a Lancer because you necessarily -want- one (except of course the Evo). You buy a Lancer because you found a good deal."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,jjorgens, 08/27/2006,"Best Performance Car for $18,000",4,"This is the most fun car I've ever driven!  I absolutely love the cool look of the car and how it turns heads everywhere I drive it.  The performance is amazing and it accelerates *extremely* quickly in 1st and 2nd gear.  The stock Eagle RS tires were kinda junk tires, but were fun to abuse.  This was my first stick shift car and the drivetrain has sustained my abuse.  The stock sound system with the Sun & Sound Package is AMAZING!  The only problem I had was with the rear suspension squeaking in extremely cold Wisconsin winters which was fixed under warranty after finding a good service manager."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Kelly, 12/14/2006,My Lancer,3,"I had my Lancer for about two years.  I thought I would get good gas mileage, but I only got about 24 mpg on the highway.  Furthermore, I was in a rear end collision and over $10,000 in damage was done just in body damage, the inside frame of the car did not hold up.  This is not a safe car..."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,aralliart, 01/24/2007,The One to Beat!,4,"Mitsubishi has a superior car in the Lancer Ralliart. The tires should be 17"". I had a little rattle in the dash but that was temporary. I have had this car for two years and counting. It is a keeper, unless I trade it in for the all new '08 Ralliart."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Apple Juice, 02/12/2007,You Get What You Pay For,3,"So I got this car a few months ago, and for the price it's the best deal, but you are getting what you are paying for. Don't expect this car to be more than what it is, because for buying it used for about $11,000, it's basically an upgraded Honda Civic. You basically feel like you are driving a..cheap sports car. There's nothing to it, it's just a standard car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,EZPiano123, 04/16/2007,What's with the fake wood trim?,4,"This is a very affordable starter car. The standard transmission on this car is sensitive but still fun to drive. Stock speakers are nice, all I had to do was increase the flow of power to them with a new deck. The only thing that bugs me about this outstanding vehicle is that damn wood trim in the es model. It doesn't mesh with anything else in the interior of the car or the exterior. I just wanna rip it out and paint it to match the gun metal-ish color surrounding the deck. Grrr! Besides that, an increase in power would be nice and I'd like to get a cold air intake installed to get the gas mileage over the 30 mpg hump. And the tiny tires NEED to be replaced. Overall great car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,CarinErin, 03/26/2007,This is a great vehicle!,5,"I bought the Lancer because I wanted something similar to a Civic, but more unique.  Buying this was actually a better deal than a Civic!  It is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage, & looks great.  It is a GREAT value!  I love my Lancer!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,Ralliartchik, 04/10/2007,Love it,5,I have the Ralliart 5 speed and love it.  I had to trade in my 2 dr car when I got pregnant and I told my husband that I would only get a 4 dr car if it is 5 speed and sporty.  This car fit me perfectly and I love it.  If I could afford the Evo I would but this is the next best thing for a reasonable price.
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,ralifan, 05/21/2007,Gonna keep it,4,"I bought this car after test driving a Mazda3, and found the Mitsubishi roomier, more fun to drive, and with more comfortable seats. And the color (phoenix red) is as close as I wished. So far, no problems at all. It's still a lot of fun, the engine has plenty of torque just from launch - basically, it can be driven in 4th and 5th in the city, except traffic lights. The Infinity audio is about as much as you can stand in a car (315 watts with subwoofer) and the sound quality is great, though I prefer to listen to the exhaust sound - the best sound I ever heard from a 4 cyl., especially if not revved over 4000 rpm. I haven't tested the new GTS yet, I'd wait for the new Ralliart."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,jeffmiller32, 07/16/2007,Great for the money,4,"I bought this car brand new.  It drives great.  I have put over 40,000 miles on it in the last 3 years and have not had any issues with it.  I have done regular oil changes, and I recently changed the pads, other than that it runs great.  We take it on road trips quite often, we can fit four 6' tall guys comfortably.  Although there is zero room for luggage because I have to 10"" subs and two amps back there.  Sometimes the ride is rough, but right after I got it, I put 18""s on it.  It handles great, but on older freeways and roads it is a bit bumpy.  The interior design is practical,gas milage is adaquate.  It is a great car for the money.  The styling is modern.  Great value for the money."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,KoNi, 09/14/2007,My First Car!!,3,"I purchased this car a few months after graduation! As my first car, the Lancer was a great investment.  I haven't had any problems at all for the past 2 years, even though I bought it used.  Just keep them tuned and in good shape and your Lancer should last you with no problem."
mitsubishi,lancer,2004,jacendb, 07/24/2013,3rd owner and no problems,4,"I bought the car in October 2011. I was looking for a Mazda but this was the only available back then and I didn't have too much time to be picky.

Besides the radiator breaking one time, I haven't had any issue.

No loose interior parts, no shaking when driving the highway. It's 9 years old and it's still soft and steady. It has surprised me in a very good way.

I will have to change the catalytic converter eventually, but everything else seems to be ok.

Parts are a little more expensive than other cars, but you won't need many.

Update: July 2016, 150K miles and still running fine.

Update: Sold it on September 2016 with 152K miles and still no issues whatsoever.

mitsubishi,lancer,2005,lotte311, 12/28/2012,Excellent car for price,4,"I bought my car in 2005 with 12000 miles on it. I am now crossing the150k mark. I have not had any major issues.
I have performed all recommended maitaince.
The only major repair so fair was a LF inner wheel which was done last year at 125K miles.
I am now routinely making 1200 mile round trips to another state and this car powers through the drive.
Pretty good for it's value, not the prettiest car on the road but if you are looking for good value for your money then this is it.
I still get an average of 25 miles in town.
On my last trip out of state I did 30miles/gallon on highways."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,JVan, 11/15/2006,Fun and Pratical,4,"This car is practical and sporty. The four  doors are nice to have, I have no problem taking four friends anywhere. I have had it for two years now and haven't had a single problem yet. Its gas mileage isn't even that bad, with about 24 mpg in the city. It handles pretty well with upgraded tires. I don't like how high the RPM's are at highway speed, 3,000 at about 100km/h."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Alan, 09/13/2010,Most reliable I have ever owned,3,"So here is the deal. I have had a slew of other cars and non of them can match up to the reliability and fuel mileage of this car. I have owned it for about 3 years and I have only had to do the basic maintenance stuff (Brakes, tires etc). I also get 38 MPG at 65 mph on the highway and about 30-32 around town. Not sure why anyone who wants a small car would spend thousands more on a civic or corolla when this car is just as good or better in some regards. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,jooey, 02/28/2011,Great car!,4,I bought this car in 1yr after it came out and it only had 12miles on it. I've had it for 6yrs now and never had a problem with it. (During those 6yrs my spouse went through 2 cars). It is the most reliable car ever. Just keep up with regular maintenance and you should have no problems. 
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Cokey, 05/10/2016,Great Value Japanese Quality at Korean Prices,4,"A nice alternative to the run of the mill Civic, Corolla, Sentra.  Much better car than the Korean ""run em' til they die"" Hyundai and Kia's.  A quality made in Japan vehicle.  And yes, sorry America, they do build better cars than us.  This is our 3rd Mitsubishi, my wife has had a Mirage and a Outlander Sport, I got this one for our daughter who's  in the military and then off to college.  I owned a 2002 Hyundai that I drove for work, and will never own another Korean car, they're fine new cars when they are under warranty; in the case of this Lancer I shopped for a used one with around 100k on it so I knew I wanted Japanese.
  When you buy one with 100k miles on it get it for a price that will allow your budget to pay for a new Timing Belt and Water Pump Kit($600 at most shops) and replace the Spark Plugs and put a new Valve Cover Gasket on it($150).  People get rid of their cars at 100,000 and they hardly ever pay out for a Timing Belt Replacement(manual states 100k), if they break your engine is totalled(interference engine = valves and pistons collide).  And if you cant afford OEM Mitsu parts, get a GMB brand kit.
Good acceleration, handling, braking; at least for an economical 4 door basic sedan.  Engine design is proven and somewhat simple.  The biggest complaint with this car, as with most ""Mitsu's"", is the interior controls are fairly cheap and break easily.  Don't worry, you can find replacements on Ebay or at your local salvage yards.  Overall, I consider the 02 to 07 Lancer's a 4 out of 5 star car.  I bought mine for $3600, put $800 into it, now have a $4400 car that my daughter informs she likes driving.

mitsubishi,lancer,2005,s1n15ter1, 03/21/2010,"Great car, bad company",4,"Bought this car new for myself, drove the wheels off and enjoyed this car completely.  It had a 10 year 100k mile warranty that was rather reassuring but when the motor blew, Mitsubishi refused to honor the warranty.  I will never again purchase anything Mitsubishi and I advise all to heed this caveat."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Bruce B, 06/03/2017,Still a great car after all these year (and miles),5,"Most reviewers here only had a few thousand miles on their Lancers when they wrote them.  I'm a little different: Bought my '05 O-Z Rally used in 2012 with nearly 160,000 miles on it.  Knew very little about Mits cars and sort of held my breath because, well, it had 160K miles on it.  Six years and 82,000 more miles later, I've never breathed easier with a car.  Just passed 242K and it still runs great.  Not as powerful as a Ralliart, apparently, but I DID hit 108 MPH shortly after buying it and could've gone faster.  Gets about 31 MPG on highways, 25 MPG in town.  Engine's a little noisy, but not bad for a 4-banger.  Good stereo system, better after I put a Pioneer deck in.  Lots of interior room, especially in front, with comfy seats.  I've never had a real problem with it and it's a nice LOOKING car on top of that.  Considering how I was sort of rolling the dice when I bought it, I'm not sure I've ever had a better, more reliable car (and believe me, I've had quite a few).  I received a decent inheritance last year and thought about finally being able to buy either a Karmann Ghia or Honda CRX si, which I'd wanted for years, but why replace something that isn't broken?  Put some money into this one instead.
"
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,BURNTLANCER, 04/01/2009,Buyer beware,2,"I purchased this lancer b/c of fuel economy and style, Mits is a good name (so I thought) & 6 year 60,000 bumper to bumper helped. 6 weeks ago on a normal day with the car only running maybe 5 min as I made a left turn the car just shuts off. Next thing I know the engine is on fire - fire department comes & puts the fire out. Car is still under warranty so I call Mits -- they deny claim with out even looking at the car. They do not stand behind their cars nor do they honor the warranty. I would not buy any car from this company.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,leftysrule22, 04/09/2012,Value value value,4,"I've owned my Ralliart since January of 2005. I am about to cross the 90k mile marker, and I can honestly say every single mile has been a blast. You wont find a comparable 2005 of any make that can touch the value of this car. Other comparable cars have higher peak hp numbers (only slightly higher too), but cant match the ralliart torque. What other 2005 under $20k can do a standing burnout without bouncing off the rev limiter? What other car comes from the FACTORY with an upper suspension brace?"
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,bambamp3, 06/17/2009,"Great, Fun to Drive & Reliable Ralliart",4,"I purchased this car used, as I had a limited budget.  The dealer was selling it below kbb value and the carfax was clean, so I wanted to see why.  I test-drove it and didn't want to let it go.  Everything was clean inside, and was in excellent working condition.  The car is very strong, you won't even notice that you're doing 70-80 already unless you look at the speedometer.  The shifter is sweet!  Short throw and a perfect match to the engine.  I also liked the exhaust note.  The former owner of the car customized the sound system of the car, so that was an added bonus too.  I am planning on keeping this car until it's at least 10 years old already.  I am totally happy with this car!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,catfeeder, 12/13/2004,"Fun, but economical?",3,"I've put about 4000 miles on my Lancer
so far.  It was a bit of an impulse buy,
but I'm happy and I have no regrets;
I'll cover the few things I don't like.

After driving stickshifts for years, I
decided to go for an automatic.  I knew
I'd lose some power and efficiency.  The
car is not particularly fast and I'm OK
with that, but for a slow car I'm
disappointed with the fuel economy.  I
expected high 20's or low 30's for MPG;
I get low-mid 20's.  

One other complaint about the automatic
is that it's not decisive on its shifts.
 The shifts are not firm (sort of mushy)
and if you mash the pedal down, the car
has to think about it a bit longer than
I care to wait for the downshift to occur."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Brillaint, 04/15/2005,Good Car Build Quality,4,"I bought a Lancer ES (Auto) for a good deal with Mitsubishis standard 100K Powertrain & 60K bumper to bumper warranty. Before buying this one I checked Corolla and Sentra then I decided to buy Lancer. Because for lesser money it got more equipment like key less entry, power windows etc. Fit and finish also really good and it comes with worry free warranty. I had 5 years of Civic and I have an Accord also. Still most of the luxury Japanese cars got the final build in Japan like Infiniti, Lexus or Acura. Other than luxury cars I believe Lancer is the only compact car build in Japan and that show its finish and build quality."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Defero, 03/13/2006,2005 Mitsubishi Lancer,5,"After careful consideration against other manufacturers, I chose the Lancer and I must say I'm extrememly pleased. It gets great gas mileage (as long as you dont go crazy), and is very peppy for 120 hp. I bought the manual to fully capitalize on power, good decision. It has excellent performance around corners, and is suprisingly quiet on the highway.  Also, what took me buy suprise was the space in the cabin. I've had six full grown individuals in my car and everyone was comfortable.  I have the convenience package, cruise control, power everything, and its definitely worth the money, I do a lot of highway driving."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,eric, 05/23/2005,Lancer Ralliart,4,"I have to say that I really enjoy driving this car!  I went into the dealership to get my Eclipse's dashboard fixed, and while waiting I just started browsing the Lancer's and decided to take one for a test drive.  What a difference between the Lancer and my Eclipse (GS 2000).  The Ralliart has a nice stiff suspension that feels great going into curves, as well as the steering feels extremely direct.  The car also feels very peppy and light and the view the driver's seat makes driving in any traffic very easy.  Factor in those Japanese seats that hold you in and it's a great experience."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Jasidus, 11/02/2005,Great Car,4,"This car is an absolute blast to drive. It performs pretty well, one of the best in its class. The engine is very good with lots of torque.

mitsubishi,lancer,2005,LeAnna, 03/01/2005,Mitsubishi... I love you.,5,"I could not understand buying this car in anything but manual.  It allows you to get every ounce of power out of the 120 hp engine. The OZ, spec wise, is just a base Evo so it is great for a tuner car.  For all ages looking for something peppy and sporty without having to compromise comfort. This car has provided enough room to fit two 6' adult males in the back comfortably for a road trip. Turning radius: this car can turn circles without the inside tire leaving it's place.  Performance is definitely a 10 for the power out of the small engine and the great handling and soundness on the road.  Fairly quiet drive."

mitsubishi,lancer,2005,JMarsh, 06/12/2005,Decent import,4,"Overall, the OZ edition is a good buy. No one would be dissatisfied by the features.  Mileage is decent and the car is plain fun.  Plus I haven't yet seen another just like mine on the road anywhere I've been.  The audio is weak, but replacing the head unit makes for a decent system.  The car is also highly modifyable, though nearly every possible change voids the warranty.  By the way, the 10 year warranty is solid."

I like the full grill as opposed to the two quarter size slotts. The clips installed on the inside panels are perfect for power wire for trunk thumpers. This is the only car I've had where the seat didn't have to be all the way back to reach the pedals sufficiently and comfortably. I wish I would have gotten the Ralliart model though. The factory brakes seem to decipate too soon."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Brad, 07/04/2006,My Lancer OZ,4,"The only problem I have had with my Lancer now at 15,000 miles is that there's no aftermarket following for these cars.

But if you're looking for a tuner car go ahead and move on or at least consider the Ralliart version."

with the shifter that came directly 
from the Evo parts bin, or hugging 
through hair pins on a local twisty 
road, you are sure to enjoy every 
minute of driving this car. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Karen, 01/15/2005,Best Backed For A Reason,4,"I purchased my Lancer in May of 2004, and my husband and I were in a severe rear end collision on January 7th, 2005 with this car. I owe my life, and the life of my husband AND my unborn child to the safety of this car. We hit a large SUV doing about 40mph. Cars are replaceable, people are not. I cannot imagine the outcome of this accident had we been driving anything else. I HIGHLY recommend the Lancer to anyone who is concerned about car safety. We are already in the process of purchasing our second Lancer. Folks, Mitsubishi means what they say about being the best backed cars in the world. They truly are. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,james, 02/20/2005,cheap and fun,5,Just traded in a Pontiac Grand Am for my '05 Lancer ES two weeks ago.  The Lancer is such a better car.  I like the look and the engine is peppy for only 120 hp.  The MPG has been far better then my Grand AM wich was also a 4-cyl. engine but doesn't feel like I'm sacrificing power even though the lancer does have less then the Grand Am.  Excellent warranty and 3 years free scheduled maintenence helped sell me on the car.  
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,James, 05/20/2005,Handles like a charm,5,I just got my Lancer Ralliart last month and the handling is great. As for the performance stock my friends Spec V can take it but with a little money all he can see is my clear tail lights. This car is great around turns and rides smooth. The all around performance and handling is great for this FWD Sedan. You must drive it to understand.
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,PittPA, 05/23/2005,nice,4,"This is my first new car...ever. It's great.  Fun to drive on the back roads and economical. The stock stereo is great too. Manual tranny is pretty good, sometimes sloppy. This is a worthwhile vehicle for someone starting out in life after college or a cheap, fun 2nd car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Lane, 07/03/2005,Needs more ponies,5,I got my car brand new with 7 miles on it 3 of which I put on during a test drive. I just wish it came with more stock hosepower.  I have a DMT racing muffler which I got a ticket for so that helps a little. It handles awsome and is just a sweet ride.
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Tom Pounds, 08/02/2005,2005 Mitsubishi Lancer,5,My girlfriend has a 2003 Lancer and had no problems with excellent reliability. So I bought my 2005 and now I am very happy.
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Jole, 09/16/2005,Love This Car,4,"Since 2002 I was driving an OZ verzion of the Lancer and I was not aware of what I was missing until I took the Ralliart for a test drive. This car is priced way under it's value. The drive is pure luxury with a touch of performance. I had to buy it even though I did not need a new one. It was hard to beleive what improvements Mitsubishi made with this car. Some of the improvements include: a sunroof, 320 watt Infinity sound system, short shifter, 16"" wheels, rear discs brakes, ABS, a suspension that is out of this world, the MIVEC engine, fog lights, a super-sounding Muffler, a Rrlly trunk net, and sport seats.  There are cars out there which are selling for $15,000 more and are still a great buy, but this car will perform better."
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Dante, 09/07/2005,Best Value in its Class,4,"This car has been fantastic.  Mine has 4,000 miles so far, no problems, firm supportive seats are great on my back.  I am  averaging 29 mpg with air running constantly here in AZ. Don't believe the hype over Honda or Toyota.  I test drove Civic and Carolla and the Lancer blows them away as far as seat comfort, ride comfort, torque off the line power, and standard features, all for thousands less. Get an ES with the convenience package.  It gives you everything you need, power everthing, AT, cruise, all for $14,000!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2005,Illini Ed, 03/16/2006,Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart fan,4,"I LOVE my new Ralliart. I've only had it a week but it might already be my favroite car (and I've had at least 15 cars in the thirty years I've been driving). I purchased a new 2005 model in March 2006 with 60 miles on it. It is an auto transmission, Lightning Yellow with Rally pkg, Sun & Sound pkg, and dealer- installed Sirius radio and side air deflectors. The 2.4 MIVEC engine is FANTASTIC! It's silky smooth, gives immediate power on demand and gets good mileage . I'm already getting the EPA mileage and the engine isn't broken in yet! The exhaust note is a sexy growl when accelerating but nearly silent at idle."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,wranglerman59, 02/22/2012,A Fun car to drive,5,"Purchased new in Sept. 06, after shopping all the others, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, etc...
we picked the Lancer.
There is plenty of room for the driver, I'm 6'4"".
Will carry 4 adults and luggage.
Handles great, good performance, for a 4 dr sedan.
Very comfortable for short or long drives (took a 7 day 4k mile trip) gets 25-30 mpg around town and 29-36 hwy. have over 98k miles and still runs great, with only oil changes, tires and timing belt replaced, still has factory brakes!
one of the best if not the best car I have every owned/driven (have owned 36 cars/trucks)"
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Tim, 10/27/2010,Love my Lancer 3,5,"As of October 2010 with over 55,000 miles still loving my 2006 Lancer SE. I had to get new tires at 50,000 miles and the brakes are about due for service (at 58,000 miles!!).  I used to tell people my 1993 Honda Civic was the best car I ever owned, but I think my Lancer has beat it. Nothing but regular maintenance after 55,000 miles and 4 years, incredible!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Bagsy1, 03/15/2007,2006 Lancer,4,I recently was t-boned on the drivers side.  The Lancer was totaled but I walked away.  I am completely satisfied with the saftey and reliablity of the car.
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,JOE LANGLEY, 11/23/2005,Sportcompact Segment's Best Kept Secret,4,"I did not know of the exsistance of this particular Lancer model, but I was forced to research this car due to rising insurance costs. I went to the dealership and was handed the keys to the Lancer ralliart W/5 speed manual transmission, the moment I slipped the transmission into first gear and rolled away, I knew deep in my heart that my search for a car was offically over.  I took a left turn out of the dealership and headed straight for the interstate where I merged into traffic with authority.  The smooth clutch and short throw transmission were a pure joy to operate.  Torque is present in abundance with no need to downshift to pass.  The handling is telepathic and this car has a great sounding exhaust."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Tanzeem, 06/10/2006,Mitusubishi Lancer ES - Excellent Value,4,"The Lancer is an excellent value!  It has Japanese build quality, feels substantial, gets good fuel economy, has an above average sound sytem, and it absorbs bumps with ease. So far my car has been very reliable. I drove a 1999 Mitsubishi Lancer MX-Extra 1.5 4cylinder in Asia for 4 years and put 178,000 trouble free miles even under extremely heat, stress, and stop and go traffic.  My brother is still driving it. The 2006 Lancer feels much stiffer, has more power, interior room and should easily last 250,000 miles+ if maintained according to the owners' manual. Overall this is one of the best Japanese Econo Sedans money can buy. It has a solid build quality.  The best value is the ES.  Go for the Ralliart if you want to go 0-100 fast and then back down to 0 with all round disc and the 2.4L engine."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Doo-B, 12/23/2006,A little car that can,5,"I am really a Supra owner, but she has died, so this is what I purchased, brand new, while I rebuild the other car. And let me tell you, I am most impressed. It has a very spacious and comfy cabin. It has a well thought out design and lay out to the controls controls and dash. The stock stereo is not bad at all for being stock. In all there is a fairly organic feel to the cabin. The rear is very spacious. My kids dig it. The trunk space is decent. It handles like a charm. We just received a huge snowfall, and its handling was very quick and precise and though I really was wishing for AWD, I have to say that the FWD did its job well. It has great perk on the highway and drives very well. In all this is a great little car. I highly approve."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Abel Gonzalez, 04/02/2016,From me to my baby girl!,5,"Bought the basic model. After 118K miles full tune up, oil change , tires, struts, valve cover gaskey and seals. Plus all belts minus the timing belt. Car should run great for the next few years for my only daughter. She loves the visibility in the window design as a new driver. Only issue is AC compressor went out at 103K miles and out of warranty. $750 to fix.
"
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Carr, 02/28/2006,Good Fuel Economy,4,"I love my new 2006 Lancer. I have about 8,500 miles on it, getting approximately 28 mpg city/mixed and 31-33 highway. It is not the fastest car, but it is quick off the line. I put a lot of miles on the vehicle, and the ride is comfortable.  My only complaint is the wind noise/vibration when only the rear windows are down, but cracking the front window stops the problem.  I have the fully loaded ES and like the styling and amenities. I do wish it had more storage capacity, but I bought the car for its combination of good fuel economy and front leg room ( I am 6 feet tall) and have no regrets. I would definitely consider a Lancer if I was buying again."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,leo, 03/16/2009,Expected beter fuel consumption,4,"Very good handling, good finish like the interior and outside design very good reliability never been in shop, but fuel consumption really not what I expected for a car of this size - really thirsty."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,slkdjfod, 06/20/2006,Fun Drive!,4,"I've had my Lancer for 9 months now and love it more and more everyday!  The only thing I could think to change is that the car could use a 6th gear for highway driving.  My MPG is on average around 28 MPG, and that being equal city and highway driving.  The only other flaw I could think of is to place the interior light closer to the back seats, because at night there is absolutely no light back there when needed."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Burford60, 07/09/2006,Fantastic car for the money,4,"I bought this car back in April for my 17 year old son as his first vehichle. He absolutely loves the car. I purchased this car because car insurance was good for a starting driver, its warranty is great, and the car has great quality.  I purchased it with the sun and sound package and the sound is unbelievable. The car rides pretty nicely, especially for an entry level car, it's no Mercedes for sure, but it has great handling.  I read many reviews on Edmunds and Consumer Reports before considering this car. It was a great choice and Consumer Reports is always right.  Overall, I would give this car a 10/10."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,A Cheung, 11/26/2005,No Regrets,5,I absolutly love my 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer. Its price to performance ratio is the best.  Its acceleration is smooth and quick.
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Rafael, 06/09/2007,Excellent Choice!,4,I love Mitsubishi cars. My previous car was a 98 Mirage (original owner). I had that car for 9 years and 135k miles and never left me stranded. Awesome little car. I traded in for a new Lancer SE and I couldn't be happier. The Lancer SE has everything i could ask for. The car is so comfortable. Engine is quiet and refined. Fuel economy is good for the class. Fit and finish is excellent. Stereo sounds great. Sun roof and power everything seals the deal for me! I highly recommend the Lancer to anybody looking for a compact car with lots of room and excellent reliability. 
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,telkbear, 08/23/2007,Great Car for the Money!,4,"I have been very happy with Mitsubishi products in the past, so we thought it would be a good move to get another.  I am glad we have!  Lancer ES has surprisingly good power to get on and off the interstate when needed, and it is very easy on gas!  Visibility is great with all of the large windows.  The cooling/heating seems to be a good balance for the entire car.  A smart buy!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Shone Joseph, 01/27/2020,Good Reliable gas saving car.,5,"I bought a 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer used few months ago with 145K miles on it. The only reason why I got this car was because the engine and the transmission was still in good condition. This car is really reliable and is a good gas saving car too. I had a 2006 toyota Camry earlier and when compared to mitsubishi lancer I didn't knew mitsubishi was as reliable as a toyota. I would definitely reccomend this car to anyone. Before I got this car I went ahead and test drove a 2005 hyundai elantra and man that car had only like 100k miles and the automatic transmission already started slipping. Man thank god I didn't take the hyundai. I am glad that I was able to get mitsubishi lancer instead of the hyundai elantra. Japanese car's are really reliable , gas saving and also there cheap to fix too incase something goes wrong. Even their parts are cheaper too. I do my own oil change so I Make sure to Put good quality oil and oil filter too. I personally use Mobil 1 since it's recommended for American and Japanese cars. I also change the automatic transmission fluid every 50k miles for my mitsubishi lancer. As long as I follow strict scheduled maintenance service for my car I believe that it can last as long as above 300k. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Lace, 11/21/2006,Lancer Ralliart Review,4,"This is a very fun to drive car.  It handles well, even in the rain. I always get compliments on my ride."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,cmcoggon, 12/17/2007,Only Lancer better would be the EVO,4,"I didn't want to get another Lancer as my wife has an '03 OZ, but I was swayed once I test drove it. It powered into traffic without effort. I was pushed into my seat by unexpected torque. I was sold at that point.  The frills (sunroof and Infinity sound system) were just the proverbial icing on the cake."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Sarah, 05/07/2009,Very pleased,4,"This car is a perfect daily driver.  Fuel consumption is actually fairly decent, I average 26-33 mpg. It's a perfectly comfortable drive, even with 4 people in the car.  Although somewhat boring (it's just THAT easy to drive--almost drives itself!), I still like my little Lancer.  I haven't had a single problem."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,justicopimp, 11/27/2006,Giving Leeway,1,"I thought that the car was very much a cheap and quick rip off.  I wish I had seen this before I bought it because I now know it thoroughly. It is quick through town, but has slow acceleration on the highways."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Tim, 06/02/2008,Love my lancer 2,5,"After 25,000 miles I had to update my  review of my 2006 Lancer SE. Still love it! After reading reviews of Honda Fit and Kia Rio5 (by the way my first choices), reviews cite poor mileage (well below EPA estimates), and some quality issues with the Kia. My Lancer is still running strong, I've done nothing but regular maintenance, and even though I was originally disappointed with the mileage, after further research it looks good (above average). My Mitsubishi has been very reliable "
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Sebastien, 10/29/2009,Amazing,4,I used to have a 2003 oz rally and I decided to change it for 2006 ralliart. I completely fell in love with this car when I test drove it. I bought it with low profile wide tires and it is incredible how I could turn corners at high speed. The acceleration is pretty good. I got it up to 220km/h without any problems. If you are looking for a fun to drive or a useful car don't look anywhere else the 2006 ralliart has what you need. 
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Jhwk, 07/14/2010,Worth every penny,4,"Lancer bought brand new from a dealer. I've had it for 4 years and the car is worth every penny I paid for it. Very economical, high clearance (yes, you can park close to the curb and not break the bumper!), decent trunk for the size, quality build vehicle. What I don't like is noise at high speeds and not the best MPs in its class(probably because of high clearance) - I was averaging 28/31 (EPA 28/34), tight pedal compartment, long working diapason of the clutch."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,sam, 01/03/2006,Exactly What I was Looking for,5,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart is exactly what I was looking for.  It looks sporty and moves well.  For the price, it is more than expected."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Tariq, 04/26/2006,Lancer,5,"I think that the Mitsubishi Lancer is definitely one of the most underrated cars on the market.  It is a lively performer.  Its looks are a bit different as well, which sets it apart from the others vehicles."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Tim, 09/20/2006,Love My Lancer SE,5,"Being a former Kia owner I was shopping for a new Kia, but found a great deal on a Lancer SE.  It was a great decision!  It rides great, has all the options I wanted, and gets good gas mileage. Although the Edmunds.com review cites poor acceleration as a drawback, they must have tested an automatic, I think my five speed is pretty peppy. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,chaga, 09/28/2006,Bueno,5,My Mitsubishi Lancer es muy beuno.  This car is absolutely great.  There finally is a compact sedan at a price to compete with the Civic that has the performance and looks to match.
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Tam, 10/29/2006,Fantastic,5,"This car is fantastic. It has zip, is very comfortable, and has tons of room in the back. The trunk is a nice size. With the price of gas, the Lancer is the auto to own. Having had Honda's, Fords, VW's, and a gas hog Jeep, this is my best decision yet. The only thing that would make it better, hmm... perhaps add cup holders in the back."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Davidl, 11/02/2006,Great Car (Ralliart),5,This is a great car.  It has great handling.  It is one of the most fun vehicles to drive in this price class.  Just remember its not an EVO!  It does everything well!
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,davidl, 11/24/2006,2006 Lancer Ralliart,4,"The car does everything well!  Just don't think you have an EVO!  This is a great car, it handles great and is very fun!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,Bad in Cairo, 11/29/2006,Can't be Beat!,4,"Having had numerous foreign cars; Kia, Toyota, Lada and US cars; Chevy, Ford, Dodge, Jeep, I can't find any real issues with this vehicle other than the 1.6 liter engine (standard in the Middle East/African regions) which cranks out 108hp. I average 34-38 highway miles. Considering the roads out my way are not comparative to the US or Europe, I find this car soaks ups the potholes quite well and only time will tell how the FWD components last. But as Japanese cars are like Mercedes and BMW's here....worth the money, I'll buy another Mitsubishi again."
mitsubishi,lancer,2006,amrou_samir, 12/19/2006,It's a Very Good Car,5,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer is a very good and economical car.  It suits my needs very well, it is a comfortable vehicle for city driving with good gas mileage."

mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Tony, 07/29/2010,Check insurance price before you buy,4,"We bought this car for my 16 year old son thinking it would be a nice car for him to drive back and forth to school.  The car looks and drives wonderful, plenty of power and great gas mileage.  Our shock was when we went to get it covered with our local insurance agent.  The price was outrageous!  I now see on the internet, it is right at the top of the list for most expensive cars to insure.  Don't make the same mistake we did; Check with your insurance agent first!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,jgskains, 08/29/2011,Best car I have ever owned,5,"Although the it didn't have the horsepower I was looking for, it more than made up for it in every other aspect. It was more comfortable than other cars in its class. It was quick, fun, and handled like a dream. It never gave me any trouble and aside from the color I got stuck with I had no regrets. I don't recommend the automatic transmission I read lots of complaints about a lack of power. But my 5 speed had plenty of power. In the end it proved itself to be extremely safe. After hitting a retaining wall and rolling mine 3 times I walked away with out injury. I love this car and I will miss this car. Eventually I will come back to this car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,fdlbym, 09/16/2011,Just to let you know about some issues...,3,"In a nut shell, if you're not impressed with the exterior design, just don't spent time looking at this one. 

Mileage is okay but not the best (low thirties on highway). Handling is good for its class but you can find other cars handles as good if not better (Mazda3). Leg room in second row is one of the best but is it that important? When it comes to shortfalls the list is longer; Engine noise is something to pay attention. Interior plastics are not better than what you would find on vacuum cleaner (similar to previous generation US cars). Together with weak engine, CVT makes you feel dead."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,mba0006, 04/24/2013,5 Year Review 2008 GTS,4,"I've owned my Mitsu for 5 years now. I am trading it in for a '13 Charger b/c I can afford one now. This was a great car! The 150 hp engine felt more along the lines of mid 200's. The cvt transmission is a bit sluggish in the low RPMs but the lancer is a fun car to drive. I am 6-2 and 200lbs. I felt comfortable in the lancer. The back seats were okay, very wide but not much leg room. The GTS is very sporty.
The Rocksford sound is great! If youre expecting it to be like the Evo you will be disappointed, but the lancer is still fun to drive and has a practicle MPG and cost. Exterior noise was the one complaint (hwy speeds are noisy) but the RF sound can drown it out ;) For the price range A+"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,HK416, 12/31/2009,Glad it's GONE,2,"Glad my Lancer is gone & someone elses problem.  Would not buy one, would not recommend one, will never own one again. Extremely under-powered, not comfortable, cheaply build. The only redeeming factor with this car is the fuel mileage, other than that - stay away from these.  Heaven forbid you have to use the A/C because the A/C will use 3 of the 4 gerbils powering this car. Had mine less than 18 months; and oh so happy it is gone. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,pxabstraction, 09/30/2013,"Soured On Mitsubishi By This Car, Money Pit",2,"Bought this at 2 years old with 30,000Km. Now has 80,000Km, 5 years old and I'm selling it.

Pros: Good mileage, comfortable, everything still works.

Cons: CVT autos are HORRIBLE. Transmission is lazy and car is gutless. Engine is noisy. Chewed through 3 sets of 18"" tires. Transmission cooler had to be replaced at 80,000Km, $1,500, should have lasted years more. Rear suspension needed $1,000 of work last year, also should have lasted longer. TMPS system cannot be disabled, does not show which tire is down, cannot remember more than one set of tires, constant paint chips, awful service.

Car is a lemon. Very displeased. Will not buy Mitsubishi again."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Nebraska, 10/05/2010,Should have read here first,1,"Why oh why did I not check here first! This car is a joke; my kids RC car has more power and is in all likelihood more comfortable. For God's sake what is in the console armrest - concrete? Cause there sure as hell is not padding. If, and it is a big ""IF"" this car had ANY redeeming qualities it would be the mileage, but who cares about mileage at the great expense of power. If you plan on passing anyone, make sure they are either riding a bicycle (and it better not be Lance Armstrong) or they are a little old lady on a motorized cart, other than that, you'll never make it. Had the car for 9-months and I will never get those 9-mos back."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Hadeswolf, 09/10/2008,Fun for Teen,4,"Had the GTS CVT for over half a year now, and I have to say, this car is extremely fun to drive. I paid a tad too much for this car, but it was worth every single penny. This car is great, looks aggressive, perfect for those teenage drivers like myself. Although I have to say I'm a little disappointed in the engine power, it's a blast to drive. The 152 hp engine could be a little better, certainly the 09 GTS with the 2.4 L 168 hp engine will be much faster. The fuel economy is rather good on this car. I get about on average 21 to 22 MPG. But for me this is hard to obtain because as a teenage driver, accelerating slowly doesn't give me a rush of adrenaline. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,geobraun, 01/25/2008,"Great value for money, best kept secret!",5,"This car has to be the best kept secret in america. I bought the GTS with manual trans. This car has the looks and prestige of an Acura TL for many many thousands less, 650 watt stereo, 30 gig hard drive to store cds, navigation that is able to play DVDs! This is my third Mitsubishi vehicle, one of which I retired after 328,000 miles!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,sweetheartkillz, 11/02/2009,I love my Lancer!!,5,"I've had this car for almost a year now. I drove  my pile of junk 2007 G6 all the down from NW Iowa to Kansas City to get this car. I love it!! I've had no problems except some jerk keyed it. : ( My brother ran his car along the side of it, but that's been fixed. It's sleek, sexy, faster than my Bf's Mustang. I agree a 6th gear would be nice but that's the only thing! If you want a quiet car, buy the automatic. Manuals are naturally louder. I haven't added anything to this car, yet. Also has awesome speakers. And as for the rattling in the door that's only from the junk you have in there, if you take all the CD's and stuff out it stops. Mine is black by the way. No paint chipping."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Rob, 07/23/2010,Great Car,4,"Just bought it about a month ago, I got it with the mud flaps and hood deflector. The hood deflector looks sexy (adds a touch of design at the front while it protects). No stone chips at all from me driving but it did have 2 or 3 at the front from the previous owner who did not put a hood protector or mud flaps on. It is the CVT auto and I don't know why people say it doesn't have enough power, it's plenty and when I switch to the manual sports mode, it goes well enough. Unless you want to race with this car, it's gonna cut it, plenty. It has more power than my old 96 civic which still had a lot of HP left. The paint job, might be a little fragile but it should technically hold out."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Eric, 08/14/2010,Could have been perfect!,4,"Had the car for 3 years now, this car is like bi-polar to me, it can give me the greatest feelings on the road or just looking at it already creates emotions. It handles nicely looks like a shark and is pretty roomy for its size. What's sad is, it is near perfect but mitsu made cuts in bad areas thinking we would not notice. First thing I notice, rattles came in pretty soon, about a month after purchase they came from the road noise and when I turn the music at near half power speaker grills rattle and doors to. And this is the BASIC sound system not even with the sub-woofer in it. And the paint. Where is it? Oh! I supposed they put in more clear then. Nope! That's not what road hazards say. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,mike, 08/22/2010,Decent Car,4,"I bought my mitsu in 2008 and am very surprised I don't see more of these around. I love the sporty design on the outside especially with the dark gray color looks exactly like a shark. The interior is comfortable and clean looking but some of the interior plastics are cheap. I also don't like the upholstery a kind of felt material that my dogs hair clings too. I find the gas mileage adequate but power is a little low;although through corners it definitely shows a sportier side. The rockford fosgate stereo is awesome as well as the easy to use navigation system. The tires make the car useless in snow because they are summer time ones. Also, starting the car is a little rough in really cold weather"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Lancer, 06/06/2008,08 Lancer,4,"I love this car. It's my first ""new"" car and for the price I am 100% satisfied with what I got. I love the sound of the mivec when you get on it a little. There has only been a couple things I don't love about my new lancer: I wish the 5 speed had another gear; when I am cruising at 70 and my rpm are just over 3k, I feel like I am straining it even though I'm not. (it does have some crazy response in 5th though, jumping up into the triple digits with just a little push!) and gas mileage could be a little better especially with the way prices are going. But in all, I'm very happy with the car. Its a joy to drive every day!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,lancer 08, 06/26/2008,Lancer 08,4,"Me and my wife both love this car. 13,000 km on it now and preforms great.  The style is the best on the road for a sedan.  the warranty in Canada is the best on the road. Wish I could have had the 2.4 from the 09, might have more power.  Not an overall fan of the CVT. I drove this car in heavy snow all winter and it preformed great. Temperature hit -40 and relays blew with only 2000 km on it. Moisture out of the factory they said. The joys of a new car I guess. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,SixFeetDeep, 07/03/2008,"Updated review, 10,000 miles later",4,"My first review was under the name Adam S. Just an FYI to all reading this. The car has been holding up pretty well. My only issues with the car has been the stock Dunlops which the dealership swapped out. They had a pulling issue from day 1 & they put on Pirelli P-Zero Neros instead. Now the car doesn't handle quite as well. Hopefully they will be better in the winter. The Dunlops were pretty scary! The paint on this car chips very easily! The front & right behind the rear doors my car looks awful! The Navi system is only current up to 2006! That is ridiculous! Mitsu's customer service has been quite poor. But overall, 10K later, the car has never given me any trouble. A+ for that."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,khusin, 08/04/2008,Love my Lancer!,4,"Bought my GTS 4 months ago and i am really enjoying it! Exterior looks great, i get compliments wherever i go. It lacks a bit of power at first but fast once up to speed, and extremely fun to drive. I have taken it to a few mountain passes and driven it along the California coast and i couldn't be happier with it. The car handles very well with very good steering feel, although with the 18"" stock wheels on the GTS it can be jarring at times. Rockford system sounds great and the sun roof is a plus. Plenty of room for me and three friends. My only complaint is the use of some cheap plastics on the interior which tend to rattle a little with the sub turned up. Overall tho i LOVE this car!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,jjwarner, 09/19/2008,Lancer stick,4,"LANCER 5 speed is a cheap car with better gas mileage than predicted.  I get 25 in the city and 37 on the road.  It needs a 6th gear however, the rpm are high on the highway after about 60 mph. It's very peppy and easy to drive.  Has a horrible blind spot on left side. The ""fast key"" and map system are bogus and the time clock takes forever to display. However, it's economy and fun to drive make up for the blind spot (bought a blind spot mirror). This is my third Mitsubishi, the cars do very well overall. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,turbodreams, 10/29/2008,Silver,4,"Have this car in Silver without a wing. The wingless lancer looks classy especially in silver. Added limo tints to the back half of the car. This adds amazing privacy for that luxuriously large back seat area (if ya know what I mean). Also if you take time to notice, the fabric used for the seats is perfect and very cleanable (much better than leather would be). I couldn't ask for sportier gauges. Thanks Mitsubishi. If 152 HP isn't enough, slap an intake an exhaust on it, you'll pass TCs, Civics and Mazda 3s. I must say when driving this car, I feel very in control of it. Many other cars don't compare. I adore my cars spacious interior so much. It's not just a car. It's an adventure. Thanks Mitsubishi."

mitsubishi,lancer,2008,FAX68, 01/19/2009,My Best Sedan Ever,4,"I love my 2008 Mitsubishi Sedan ES Manual with 41,225 miles.  It never gave me any problems except for getting use on those computer gadget on the dash.  I live in the northeast and drive on Interstate 95 all the time 7 days a week sunny or nor'easter.  Who said it's bad on snow? I realized it is not the car it's the tires.  I almost hit the railing on 95 but the car tremendously responded on my driving and avoided a total wreck.  No power? Just use 4th gear all the time to pass cars. it can pass 2 to 3 cars in a second especially with a manual. The secret is learn to drive this car. ""You control the Lancer Don't let the Lancer control you.""  The Lancer is fast just be aggressive."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,sephiroth1386, 01/29/2009,Love this car,4,"I've had this car for about a year now, and I've never had ANY problems with it. Not even the paint chipping problems that some have had. The only reason I'd trade this car in, is for either the Ralliart version or Evo X."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,hayesd2, 02/09/2009,Great Car For The Money,4,"I bought the 08 new and have had it now for a little over a year.  I have the ""sun and fun"" package along with the wing on the rear.  The only real flaw I can think of is that the car should have had a 6th gear.  Gas mileage would have been far better and the wear and tear on the engine would be reduced.  I would buy it again "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Lori Claar, 02/27/2009,Hope you like spots!!!,3,"My Lancer looks awesome with the body kit straight from the manufacturer and the exceptional look of the front end.  But I live in central Pennsylvania and my car is not looking good after only three months of winter. I was told to purchase mud flaps to prevent chipping, and when I went to purchase the flaps after I bought the car, the dealership informed me they do not make them for the ES body type. Now not only is it chipping but there are 8inch strips of paint by the back doors that are gone. THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE IT WAS BROUGHT ON BY AN OUTSIDE SOURCE. Do you think it may have something to do with the paint or the way the car was designed????????"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Ssikpiyelnats, 05/07/2009,Affordable fun!,4,"I've had the 08 Lancer ES with the sun and sound package for a year now.  I've found it extremely enjoyable.  I added a K+N air filter, and an axle back Flowmaster 40 series exhaust, and noticed a performance increase and MPG increase immediately.  The sound system is great, gives a nice rounded sound without being overbearing.  The transmission is smooth, and the car can be tossed around with relative ease.  I love the interior design, there's beauty in simplicity.  Everything is integrated into the dash, making it flow wonderfully.  The only complaint I have is that after a year, the padding used on the rear dash to deaden rattles has worn out, causing vibrations with the music.  Annoying."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Shane, 06/14/2009,Good car,4,"Loved this car, I have the ES. Nice cheap car to get you around.  Have taken it to Dallas and back a few times which is about 4.5 hours away from me.  Loved driving it every mile of the way.  Haven't had any problems with it at all yet.  The engine doesn't feel that luckluster for a tiny 4 cylinder which is good. Car is amazingly sharp when just putting tint on the windows and giving it a good wash.  A real looker.  Gas mileage is awesome,  I drive the highway to work and back and get around 33mpg when I don't use the a/c.  Very very nice car, I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have kids.  Backseat is a little small."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Aaron, 06/20/2009,Love my 08 Lancer!!!,5,I have had my lancer for 2 years now and I work at a GM dealership believe it or not. I love my lancer. I was surprised to see all the problems that people were having with paint chipping and noise in the cabin as I have not experienced any of these. I have the GTS with AWD and it handles absolutely beautiful on the snow here in upstate New York. I'm going to keep this car till it hits 200-300k. In the meantime I am buying a 2010 Camaro for a toy. 
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Alfred, 03/28/2010,For those with good taste,4,"I have owned my Lancer GTS since late 2007 and it is my first car. I did get it keyed by some ******  dog a month after I bought it (hopefully karma got him). Besides that, this car is excellent. I am in love with the 650-watt sound system it has and its navigation system. As for the paint, It has chipping and scratches over the front bumper but that's because I live in the northeast. I have had no mechanical problems so far which is a testament to Mitsubishi's renewed oath to quality. I would recommend getting aftermarket performance parts to beef it up. I think that the 5-speed manual is better since the automatic does not exploit all of the engine's power. No rust so far ha!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,ElectroBuff, 04/03/2007,"Lancer GTS CVT, neck breaker",5,"Let me just start by saying, I never was a Mitsubishi fan. Most of their cars were small and dull. I actually went to the dealership to test drive a 2007 Mazda CX9. The price wasn't right so I found myself walking off the car lot, but I had to go through the Mitsubishi side of the dealership to get to my car. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a Graphite Gray Pearl Lancer 4dr CVT with paddle shifters and the Sun & Sound Package with Navigation and a 30GB hard drive calling my name. Needless to say I went home that night with the car.  And it has been breaking necks every since.  This car is pound for pound untouchable by Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, ScionTC, Chevy Colbalt, Acura NSX. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,simon, 04/08/2008,What an Awesome Car,4,"What a great car! It is excellent quality, fun to drive, great auto and it is so small and quiet. It is very quick too and you do not know that you are doing 75-80 mph at times! There is plenty of room for four and luggage and it carries them superbly. The sound system is excellent for a factory sound unit and really can be turned up. A joy to own."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Stcharlesguy, 05/07/2008,Lot of car for the money,4,"What a great car!! I cant say enough about it!! i was worried when i bought it, going from an Infiniti to a Mitsu. Boy was i wrong. Much quicker response, funner to driver, more sportier. Don't let the 2.0L engine scare you, this thing is flying down the road before you know it. The CVT really makes that possible! I Have the fully loaded GTS with nav. It's ridiculous how many options you get for such a small price. I paid twice as much for my Infiniti and got a lot less."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Keith, 05/07/2008,Great Car & Lots of features,4,I purchased this car in hopes of having a nice ride with optional MP3 & Sat Radio options for trips. Well i found out i can even watch movies on this Rockford Fosgate System w/ sub & i get 32 mpg on the HWY @ 80 mph. I traded an old civic in for this & it has definitely grabbed me. I would say test drive & see how responsive they are vs. a Scion TC or Corolla you get much more & better fuel economy for less coin ;) 
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Allen Fort, 05/21/2008,Great car,5,"Wow!! What is there not to say about this car.  I've had it for almost a year and already put 16k on the thing.  I can't leave it parked in the driveway, it's just to sexy for that.  It definitely needs to be opened up to get best results.  I have the fully loaded GTS, has nav, blue-tooth, great system and don't forget the paddle shifters.  The new Lancer gets great gas mileage and is extremely fun to drive.  I do enjoy the keyless entry, however, don't leave the car on and take the remote out too many times, soon it will tell you the key is missing even though its not.  This car is definitely a ""Head Turner""."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,ssikpiyelnats, 05/25/2008,This summer will be fun...,4,"The thing that I like most about this car, is that even at the base model the entire car looks aggressive. You didn't get that with the previous years. I have the ES 5 SP with the 650 Watt stereo and I love it. I'm 6'4"" and had to scoot the seat closer for comfort. The new forward swept windshield keeps the sun out of your eyes, great feature in Florida. The engine is quick to respond for a 2.0 L, and you're hitting 80 before you know it. The gas mileage leaves a bit to be desired, but it's not horrible. The interior is wonderful, doesn't feel like it was built with cheap plastic parts. And the AUX port to plug in the iPod, thank god. I'm able to carry my entire music library.  Great car!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,PJ, 05/04/2010,Never again,1,The most uncomfortable and most underpowered vehicle I have ever owned. Center console might as well be a concrete block. Paint quality is ridiculously poor; and need we even discuss engine power? Or rather lack thereof. While the mileage of the V4 is nice; having a V6 would be much better.  Hindsight is 20/20 and I should never have bought this vehicle. From about day 5 of ownership I tried to get rid of it.  Found some other sucker to buy it; never again will I own a Mitsubishi - stick to televisions.
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,FMF DOC, 06/29/2009,Very much underestimated,4,"I am in the military in the middle of nowhere, so I get a whole lot of highway miles. However, I am from Chicago so I am very much a city driver. The GTS fulfills my needs. My only after market modification is a K&N cold air, and my GTS is superb. Handling is definitely sharp, brakes and safety are more than what you can ask for. Lacks a bit of top end speed but with the right shifting you can overcome more than you think."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,LVnative, 03/09/2010,Good riddance,1,"Could not be happier its gone! The most underpowered vehicle I have ever owned; might as well mow the lawn. This car is a joke; would not buy again; would not recommend to anyone; STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR.  Getting rid of this car was the best thing I did!  Not comfortable, VERY underpowered!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,rwilliams148, 10/30/2010,You get what you pay for I guess,2,"I have had my 2008 Lancer GTS for almost two years now. At first it was great but at 61,000 miles trouble started. My blower motor has already went out and we just recently moved and now have a gravel road. I have dust coming inside the car from my glove box, all vents, my cd player, my steering wheel column, and all the doors. I contacted Mitsubishi about this and they will not do anything. It is a nice looking car but very cheaply made. My alignment has been fixed now 8 times (and I drive normally just more than most people). The steering wheel has started shaking extremely bad but the no one can seem to tell me why. Because of these reasons, I will not purchase another Mitsubishi."

mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Nick, 02/27/2009,There's much better,3,"Many complain that gas mileage is ""poor under hard acceleration, no HID lights, no leather option, etc.""  This is an economy car people!!!!  Of course mileage is bad when you drive aggressively, HID's come on cars that are typically $25K+ (as well as leather).  I will review this car for exactly what it is and against it's competitors.  The build quality is horrible.  Paint is very bad as well.  Mileage is excellent, though.  Interior materials rattle, interior noise can be deafening.  It's not ""exciting"" to drive, nor is it fast.  SUV's smoked me at on-ramps.  It looks good though.  For the same price, VW Rabbit, Mazda 3, etc are all better choices.  I got rid of my Lancer after 5 months."

Based on the reviews previously I had read & thought wow this car will have everything I've been looking for.  Afterthoughts of ownership - 1.5 yrs - car is lacking in quality at build. From day one I had asked the tech about engine noise above 2500 rpm. The cabin is always filled with noises of some kind. Recently, the rattles from the doors are killing me.  I warn those who buy this vehicle that any car that gives you a rebate will come back to bite you in the end. When they give a 5k rebate, that means you're now 5k down in what you paid for it.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,mcarm, 04/28/2009,Mitsu. does not back their product!,3,"Bought in 07-Drawn in by the great new design I decided to give Mitsu a chance.  They were rude from the start and never should have bought this car.  Had problems with tires, window leaking, sunroof, the car pulls to the left, TERRIBLY CHEAP paint- hundreds of tiny paint chips.  Brought the car in over 15 times in the 1.5 yrs I had it.  I was always upset over the problems and no one cared.  I spoke to everyone that worked at Mitsu and they were disrespectful and rude.  I have never been treated so badly.  I asked them to check out the paint and that was months ago and never heard back.  No matter how good this car looks, do not get it.  I hate the comp so much I took a hit and traded it in."

I first discovered just how scary this car was on a snow covered slight uphill driveway when the whole front end slid to the right! There was absolutely no traction from the tires and when I called the dealership, they suggested I get snow tires to the tune of $1300. They did offer to mount/balance them at a discount, however I was very disappointed. I was unable to drive my NEW car during predicted snowstorms and when I got caught in a few ""dustings"", I was unable to get up my driveway and once barely made it down the road! Has anyone used snow tires? Did it work"

The right front door rattled terribly and the dealership kept pretending not to hear it.  They also refused to print work orders for my car.  The windshield wipers went out on me in the pouring down rain for about 5 minutes on the highway during rush hour.   The subwoofer in the trunk became dismounted within the first week of me having the car.  Ended up getting an 08 Nissan Altima Coupe.  I love it.  Better quality car and comes with better customer service."

From the first time it was driven off the lot i noticed that it was a very noisy engine. From a stop there is no power, getting in the third from second gear is a different story. Overall, the car is very nice. It is a seriously big jump from previous generations of Lancers. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,IdleWanderlust, 12/25/2007,Not a bad ride.,4,"Bought a fully loaded Lancer GTS manual with sun and sound package and navigation, Love it, car gets better fuel economy that I expected, combined city/hwy of 29.3mpg and straight hwy at about 34 or so. Not bad when usually traveling at about 75mph. The only complaint I have is the car pulls slightly to the left and my dealership has stated there is no issue. I am hoping they will get it resolved soon as I went back and test drove another GTS and found no noticeable pull. I am starting to think that the suspension might need adjustment as the other GTS I tested had a much tighter steering which I preferred."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Desprate For Power, 11/22/2008,More Power,4,"Okay there is the DE Lancer the ES Lancer and the GTS, I own the GTS and I just don't see the point, because it looks just like the others.  I have the CVT transmission which makes the 0-60 an astonishing 11.7 seconds.  It is extremely underpowered and overpriced for that power, you can get the same car in the DE or the ES.  you can order the same accessories as well.  The car weighs 3100 lbs, and puts 139 hp to the wheels.  I put rims on my GTS and it looks amazing, but needless to say wouldn't they all. I would also say get it without the spoiler if you ever hope to see out of the rear window. It is a great car I can say that!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,LovelyNurseLindy, 01/15/2008,Never looked back!,4,"I did my research and test drove a lot of cars.  This car is by far the most car for the money!  I got a loaded Lancer for the base price of other brands (altima, etc.).  I've had my car for 4 months now and I am very happy with everything!  Love the car, especially the extras.  Get a lot of looks on the road and family and friends love it!  I haven't looked back since I got it.  It makes driving fun again."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,koolcisco, 01/29/2008,Mitsu got it right!,4,"Test drove the Mazda 3, Civic Ex and the lancer by far the Lancer was a funner ride and beats the others in styling and buck for the money. I bought the Lancer Es Manual Tech and Appearance pkg it was just funner than the CVT even with those cool paddle shifters. So far the car's been great sure we all want more power but for the money I think its pretty peppy of course low end torque could get more work but satisfied overall. Can't wait for all the upgrades since its the same engine as the Evo yay!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,mbcowboy, 01/31/2008,Great car for the Price,4,"Great driving car, starts well in -30- 40C temps. Warms up quickly without much pre-warming. The CVT is great, has the power that i need. Has a lot of features for the price compared to other vehicles. I had compared different sub-compacts for price and driving quality and the Lancer was still the best. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Jimmy, 02/13/2008,Excellent bang for the buck!,4,"This is a fully juiced GTS! For the tech-toys that come along with it, this car is a no-brainer. Having read many reviews in advance, I was concerned about the lack of power, but after test-driving the car, I found that it had all I needed. Anymore (i.e., Ralliart or Evo) would just get me into trouble. If you are more concerned with excellent looks and cutting-edge tech goodies at a great price, you cannot beat this car."

Everything from styling to creature comforts has helped raise the bar for this class of sedan. The car is a joy to drive, and the paddle shifters for the CVT transmission on the GTS model allow you to keep the engine in its sweet spot while carving through tight corners. The car is built tight with no squeaks or rattles of any kind. The optional 650 watt Rockford Fosgate audio system packs a punch, especially with the included subwoofer. I would recommend this car without hestitation."

mitsubishi,lancer,2008,JEFF_IL, 04/23/2007,Features To Price Ratio = Unbeatable!,4,"I intended to wait until next year, and get the EVO, but after asking the wifey, ... well, you get the picture.  :-)  First off, the suspension/handling package (on the GTS) is unbelievable.  I've driven quite a few cars, and I must say, this is the most impressive part of this car!  Word is, it's fairly close to the suspension that will be found in the EVO-X.  This car has more available features than any car in it's class (I got them all).  The Multi-Communication / Navigation / Sound package is something you'd expect out of a $100k luxury sedan.  Looks!  Got it in Electric Blue Pearl, and with the GTS package, it turns a lot of heads.  WORTH EVERY CENT!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,zunescene, 05/12/2007,2008 GTS Lancer w/ Sun & Sound,4,I really like the appearance of the car and how it feels spacious inside.  The paddle shifters are really really fun. The CVT does not like to run in high rpms or go fast but it does like to conserve gas.  I like to switch between auto and manual depending on my mood.

mitsubishi,lancer,2008,GNNR, 05/14/2007,I am IMPRESSED,4,"Love my 08 Black GTS with Sun/Sound and Nav/Tech.  It handles great, firm and sporty but not harsh, with precise steering and excellent balance with little hint of over or understeer even hard into a curve.  Fit and finish on the exterior is excellent, same on the interior (I question the carpet and 'crushed velvet' lint brush interior cloth).  The NAV system is precise, the stereo very good with lots of power but decent clarity.  Mileage so far is great too.  The MT/Paddle CVT setup is actually pretty good, but almost demands you manage it manually if you want a sporty drive. Definitely could use more HP, 10-20 more."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Brian, 04/20/2007,Amazing Car,5,"I have wanted a Mitsubishi for a few years now.  I am in college and I had an '04 Mazda3.  We had so many problems with it, it was time to get rid of it.  I saw the new Lancer and I fell in love with it.  I am a red guy, so I saw the commercials with the Rally Red Metallic paint job and I fell in love with the car.  I needed the Sun and Sound Package for sure.  The navigation was a little too expensive for me, but the car is great without it.  Within a week of looking at them, I bought one.  I have the only Rally Red Metallic GTS CVT with the Sun and sound package that was available in the state.  It was very hard to find, but the salesman did a great job at getting it for me.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,ChrisF, 05/09/2007,A lot of car for the money,4,"Plain and simple, can't get more for your money with any other car. Options match that of a Acura or Lexus. Fast key is awesome, navigation is easy to use, 650 watt sound system is the best stock system I have ever heard and the sunroof is, well a sunroof. Bluetooth is cool and music server is sweet. Interior is comfortable, exterior is slick with 18 in wheels to top it off. 6sp CVT has some giddy up and the paddle shifters makes it an overall fun car to drive. Its not an EVO so don't expect it to drive like one. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,BeGood, 05/10/2007,A Mitsubishi Lancer DE,4,"Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. The size is deceiving, the car has lots of room in the cab and trunk. Compared to my 2003 Galant ES, this car is a generation better in technology. However, the Galant is better (fun and comfort) to drive and has better fuel economy. Having said that, this car holds its own in terms of performance and comfort. The interior is basic. Cheap looking/feeling fabrics and hard edged plastics. Not a lot of amenities such as an additional power outlet (option), covered storage, arm rests, seat adjustments (has fore/aft & back tilt), coin holder, etc. I have to step back and tell myself that I purchased this car as a beater to drive to work."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,SpartanHelios, 06/01/2007,Best Looking Car Ever,4,"This is my first new car and I can't think of a better vehicle to ride in.  The car has the best character lines I have ever seen. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone even considering a Civic, Corolla or a Scion.  The most bang for your buck in this class period."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,ksampsel, 06/22/2007,Love it!,4,"I purchased the GTS model with the 5 speed manual, with the sun and sound package, and the navi and tech options.  Handles great, stereo system is awesome (Rockford), lots of features for your money.  You do hear a lot of road noise and engine noise.  I think they need a quieter engine.  It sounds like it's knocking.  They took away from the quality of the interior for all of the electronic features.  I love this car, though, it's fun to drive.  As far as power I thinks it performs well. I was doing 60 from traffic light to traffic light without realizing it.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,GypsyBlu, 07/14/2007,Coming from a new Civic....,4,"I checked this Lancer out, I had an old one and then a new Civic coupe EX fully loaded. The electric blue is amazing, it was the very first thing that made me want to look at the car. With the keys in hand I took a 50 mile test drive. The handling of the car was great, almost like my BMW. It is heavy and stays on the road. The sound system is awesome along with the bluetooth, all the info screens and the FAST key - love that I no longer need a key. The car does use a bit more fuel then my Civic, but the handling is well worth it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Geodude, 07/10/2007,Lancer GTS looks like twice the price,5,The Lancer GTS is a lot of bang for the buck! I looked at cars in the same class as well as some upscale makes in the same size. Hands down this car is the best value and absolutely the best looking including cars costing much more money. I've never had so many compliments at stop lights and convenience stores. Mitsubishi may well be on their way to moving up the sales  ladder with this fantastic car with Japanese reliability!
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Great Car, 08/21/2007,Love the new car!!,4,"I just bought the 2008 ES 5 speed manual transmission Lancer and I love it.  It has plenty of power to pass slower moving cars, has great design features and has tons of options that are standard.  This is a head turning car for sure!!  I like how it was built ready for after market performance upgrades as well.  Which are definately going on in the near future.  It handles great and I love the sound of the engine when you get the revs above 3500.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,AP in KS, 09/06/2007,Definitely built with consumer in mind!,4,"I was in search for a car that I didn't expect to exist: sporty enough to meet my high standards but would work for a future family car. That is just what I found in the new 2008 Lancer! We added the Sun and Sound package which is really fun for summer driving! Talk about built with the consumer in mind! Everything about the car, from displays and gadgets to handling and mpg, this car meets every one of my needs and wants!! The bluetooth, steering wheel controls, and multi-dash display make for a very safe and forward facing drive. This car turns heads more than my Eclipse! I absolutely love to show this car off, inside and out!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,GC, 09/11/2007,One thing missing,4,"The 2008 Lancer GTS is almost where it needs to be. It looks the part, but if it had more juice it could play the part. I have owned several cars and looked at/drove several others prior to this purchase. Bottom line up front: you get your money's worth with this car. The ride is firm and balanced, not too harsh. It looks interesting both inside and out. It is on the verge of replacing the Honda Civic, Scion tC and Mazdaspeed3 as the next tuner favorite. The CVT is a pleasure to have along with the other tech-worthy toys inside. Mine is a daily driver, but will also be my hobby to add upgrades to. My intent is to find the hidden horsepower that Mitsubushi neglected to give the GTS."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Adren, 09/20/2007,Slightly disappointed,4,"Going from my 2000 Eclipse GT to this car was a big difference, especially the power and acceleration, I am satisfied with everything but the power, I wish they offered a larger engine or gave the 2.0 a smaller version turbo compared to the EVOs, but other than that, as stated, I am satisfied with this car... for now."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,P$, 05/25/2007,I Love This Car,4,"I just recently purchased my 2008 Lancer GTS and I love it! I was the first person to purchase one at the dealership. My GTS is Graphite Pearl Grey, it has the sun and sound package. Drives very well and is very fun to drive. I got the CVT with the magnesium paddle shifters, they are so fun and easy to use! Definitely would recommend this purchase to anyone."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,James in VAB, 06/10/2007,This is a great car,4,I went for a test drive and ended up trading my brand new Nissan with only 7000 miles on it.  This is a great car.  The Bluetooth and sound system are awesome.  Sirius radio works flawlessly.  The CVT is amazing.  Safety features abound.  This car is perfect for weekday commuting and weekend getaways!  I would tell anyone looking for a car in this class to add the Lancer to the list.  This is the Lancer that should've been built 5 years ago.
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,AaronB, 06/07/2007,Lancer GTS is a great car for the price,4,"I did a lot of research before I decided to buy this car, and I couldn't be happier with my decision.  You get a lot of car for your money.  Some decent factory equipment (unfortunately mine didn't come with the nav system). Surprisingly comfortable for a small car with a driver who's 6'2 (3 inches of head room).  The new exterior redesign is just awesome.  Really a fun car to drive.  The only real complaint I have is that this car could use more horses.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,lucas from canada, 07/07/2007,New car on the block,4,"This car was love at first sight. I love the look, the drive, and most importantly the price tag. As my first car, this car has all the features a young businessman could want. Sporty with a touch of elegant, it's perfect for my daily commute and weekend drive to the beach. Mitsubishi made a statement with this car and they do have the most competitive price. Good job Mitsubishi Motors!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Dan, 07/19/2007,Great Car!!,4,Love this car.  Ever since I saw this car I wanted it.  Funny thing is I couldn't afford it.  But when my old car was totaled.  This was the first car I went to see.  I just love the look of this car.  Everything about it is great. The gas mileage could be better but other than that its a great car.
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,GypsyBlu, 07/22/2007,Miss my Civic... NOPE!,5,"Had a new 06 EX Civic with navi, and loved that car but went for test drive with my son, and fell in love with my new Lancer GTS, The lancer has everything a Techi Woman like me needs and craves. The handling is very solid unlike my Civic, and does not float on the highway at all, the bluetooth and fast Key are a big plus. The auto headlights and all the info screens are something the Civic should have, maybe next year. I loved my Civic, but the toys on this Lancer are too much more fun. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Sarahzsmyl, 08/23/2007,I wanted a Mustang,4,"I really wanted a 2007 Mustang, but I started comparing, and chose this one. I couldn't be happier.  I got an Electric Blue Lancer GTS with the nav system. The car runs smoothly, handles well, and looks great. With 18"" wheels, the ride can be a little rough, but that's ok. The car is gorgeous. I get looks where ever I go.  I've used three tanks so far and get good mpg, about 32 hwy and 26 city. The paddle shifters are fun, but prefer to use the stick to hold it into 2nd gear for acceleration. And so far, that's the only real draw back, it can be hard to get up to speed in auto-mode.  But, kick it into manual mode, and all that goes away. I don't regret my choice at all."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,tgriffaton, 09/13/2007,I wasn't looking for a new Lancer,4,"I wasn't looking for a new car, but a deer convinced me to look for a new one! So I headed over to the dealer... wow!! Love the styling of the inside and outside. Car shifts great, the handling and feel are much better than my 2004. This car is a head turner!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,SoSassy, 09/21/2007,Lots of toys for the money!!,4,"Traded my Montero Sport which I loved but it didn't have any toys in it. Shopped for weeks and no other car or SUV could offer 1/2 of the options my Lancer GTS has for the price I paid. I got everything including dealer aftermarket leather which I love. I almost went with the aqua but I am so glad I changed my mind and got the Graphite Grey with tinted windows. It looks so sporty but, still very classy. Even with the suggested improvements I note, I have no regrets whatsoever... okay one, I really wanted a nav system with real time traffic maps. Oh well, got to compromise a little unless price is no issue for you."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Andy, 09/26/2007,Slipped through Quality Control,3,"When I first saw the commercial for this car I was very intrigued.  When my truck died I needed a new daily driver car.  I test drove it and ended up buying it the same day.  Sadly, after a month the problems crept up.  Its been in the shop for 10 total days now because of warranty issues.  Anyone who has the nav system and the Rockford sound system try this: turn on the accessories but dont start the car.  Watch a DVD or listen to your radio for an hour.  Then start your car.  On two separate occasions, my car shorted out its throttle body.  8800 total miles on it, inexcusable.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Nate, 05/30/2007,Great Car,4,"This is a great, fun car. The GTS model with all the toys is the one you want. The GPS navigation is easy to use, the Bluetooth is a great convenience, the 18 inch wheels give this car a fantastic look. I just wish this car, the GTS variant that is, was given more power and I do agree with another reviewer that it should be about 10-20 more horses. Despite that, the car handles greatly thanks to a solid chassis that also is begging for more power. Honestly, with the Electric Blue Pearl color, I am also getting thumbs up everywhere I go. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Clayton, 06/14/2007,"Great options for ""econobox""",5,"This car is miles above others in the compact segment.  The power is adequate but leaves something to be desired.  Other than that, no complaints.  Looks at every stoplight."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,chewy1885, 06/21/2007,2008 Mitsubishi Lancer ES CVT,5,The car is a great choice for the money.  You get great performance with awesome comfort.  It is a sports car that is a great family car.  I got the silver with everything except the navigation.  
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,eric49er, 07/16/2007,Proud new owner,4,"Bought an electric blue GTS with CVT. Looked at lots of cars (Scion xB, Kia Spectra 5, Honda Civic Si sedan, Saturn Aura, VW Rabbit) and just bought this one.  I love the looks and all the features.  I bought nav option with Music server. Still trying to figure it all out, but I really like it so far.  One thing: MP3 CDs will not store in the MusicServer, but WAV files will store, you just have to type in the names of the track yourself.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Matt in Ohio, 07/20/2007,Very Happy Owner,4,"This is my first new car, and I am extremely happy with my decision.  Chose this over Scion tC and Honda Si because I love the sharp edges and corners of the Lancer, not to mention the extra room inside.  Went with the sun and sound package with the nav system. Everyone is intrigued by the FAST Key and stereo system.  Fun to drive in either automatic or with the paddle shifters.  I only wish there was some more power, but it is definitely sufficient."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,RkQue, 08/02/2007,Fun for this teen!,4,"I just purchased the 2008 ES with CVT and oh man is it fun to drive.  I got all the options including the navigation system, Sun and Sound package, and bluetooth.  This car is such an upgrade from my previous car (02 Chevy Malibu). It handles corners with a breeze, and its high speed pick up is very much unexpected.  My brother just bought a brand new Lexus IS 250, and my car has all the same options for less than half the price!  With a few performance upgrades coming in the near future, this car will be a fast, head-turning, teched out piece of automobile art!  Oh and by the way, it looks great in black!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Mike, 09/05/2007,Features/great looks for not much $$,5,"My wife and I recently picked out this car as we wanted to go from a two vehicle household down to one to save some money.  We sold her 07 Honda Fit and traded in my Nissan Armada towards the Lancer GTS w/ nav and tech package and sun and sound package.  Have not looked back since.  This car looks beautiful and turns lots of heads on the roadway.  For all the features you get (safety and tech-wise) you really can't beat it at all, not for the money anyway. Far too many Accords and Altimas out there, do yourself a favor and at least test drive the 08 Lancer GTS!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,justin, 09/24/2007,"No ifs, ands or buts",4,"While its not the Evo X,  it's still a great car and fun to drive.  The CVT is one of the best features on this car. While other cars lose speed when up-shifting, the Lancer w/ CVT just keeps gaining speed.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,john bell, 10/30/2007,The best looking car for under $35 K,4,"It looks great, has a lot of features for the price but it really really needs more power!! The engine is small and very noisy! Every time you try to accelerate from a traffic stop or even worse, at the toll booth the poor engine screams. Except for this, the car is really great. The CVT is nice, the paddle shifters are even nicer and in my opinion the next better looking car on the road is in the  $35/40k zone . The Lancer is really a head-turner, stylish, sporty, remarkable!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Kevin, 11/07/2007,Don't deal with Mitsubishi,2,"It was very nice at first then unusual stuff started happening to the car. Stuff Mitsubishi won't cover. For example, earlier this week, I was driving down the highway at 60 mph. There was no one on the road in front of me and there was no overpass. Clear skies. All of a sudden I heard an explosion right above me. It was the sunroof. Glass started flying off the back of my car from the sunroof. I had no idea what just happened and am absolutely positive that nothing hit the car. After getting the run around from the dealership and their hot line, and finding proof this happened to other people (there's an entire forum with people with similar stories) They still said they would not cover it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Adam S., 03/09/2008,2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS,4,"The car has decent room w/ comfortable seats for long trips (folding in the rear 4 more cargo space). It has great features like the GPS, hands free Bluetooth, 650W stereo w/ the 30GB hard disk w/ Sirius and especially the Fast Key!  The CVT is really smooth and the paddle shifting is fun w/its 6 dedicated gears. The 2.0 engine is surprisingly peppy, though just not off the line. Mileage has been much better than I expected w/ 33-40+MPG doing 55-65 mph on the highway and no less than 26+ around town. Overall ride is well controlled & neve r harsh. Handling is really fun in this car and the brakes are also really good."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Cheap Milwaukeean, 03/12/2008,Great Car for the Money,4,"Have owned the car for 3 weeks now and put fuel in it twice.  I am averaging 27.5 mpg in a city/hwy mix while being rather aggressive with the throttle. Not as good as I could get with a smaller car but I am 6-4 300 lbs and I'm  comfortable in the Lancer.  The car has plenty of HP and torque.  I have found myself doing 90mph on the freeway without much effort. Getting around town is effortless.  At 6'4"" I actually have the drivers seat up a notch which surprised me.  The back seat provides enough room for 2 kids (1 in a car seat).  Seats are comfortable too.  The gauges are laid out well and the car performs all the functions that it should rather well.  I need more room to write the review"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Jessechop, 04/03/2008,Love it,4,"Girlfriend and I just bought a new 08 Lancer and love it. Handles great, even in the snow. Fuel economy is ok, a lot better than the trucks we are usually driving. The CVT is really neat"
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,mrmspyder, 12/09/2007,I love this car,5,"I traded in a 2000 Firebird Formula on a 2008 Lancer GTS.  I was shocked at how great the performance was on the GTS. The CVT takes some getting used to, but with the paddle shifters I'm able to manuever in traffic fairly easily. The car feels faster than the specs lead you to believe.  The technology of this car is amazing. I got the optional DVD navigation system with the 30 GB hard drive. I'm able to store 100 CDs on the hard drive which is very nice.  I love the fuel economy too. I've been averaging 26 mpg and using regular gas, so I'm saving a ton of money compared to my firebird.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty practical car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Jacki Monnat, 05/01/2008,Paint chips,3,"After 6 weeks of owning the car and 3,000 miles I noticed Paint chips on the side in front of the rear tires. I took it to the dealer and they took pictures and sent them to Mitsubishi and they said they wouldn't cover it that it was my fault. The front tires kick off stones causing a sandblasting to the side of the car. They said they didn't make mud flaps for them yet. It gets worse everyday. I see more people are having the same problem. I am now filling out paper work for the attorney General. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Nic231, 05/02/2008,Awesome Car,4,I do have to agree with the snow thing. I live in Chicago and this car sucked on even a dusting of snow. But other than that this car rocks! I love the sound sys. Love the nav. Looks are good but the tires. Be careful not to bump the curb with these rims. It will grind up the rims. Car dose need more hp and the 16 more for 09 ain't cutting it! 
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,blu5092, 05/21/2008,Great toys for the money,3,"This car has lots of features that would cost some serious green with other competitors. The Nav and sound system alone is good enough for a purchase. The car itself, unfortunately could have have been better. I found it sluggish. The CVT is almost unbearable. It feels like it's being pushed to catch up with the engine. The car screams to get going from a starting position. I think that a regular automatic would have been a better choice. This engine is supposed to be lighter and have impressive HP for it's size. My Suzuki Reno is faster getting to 60. Other CVTs in the market don't feel like this. I crank the radio up so I don't hear the motor. It also gets poor gas mileage on hard acceleration."
mitsubishi,lancer,2008,Brandon Smedley, 11/30/2020,Fantastic For Its Class,5,"I got my 2008 Lancer GTS used with 180,000kms. I've had it for almost 2 years now and is now at 222,000. This car has been nothing but good to me in this time. Starts in -35c Canadian weather? Yep. Plows through snow? Yep. Looks away more aggressive than it actually is? Also yes unfortunately. However, I have gotten compliments on the car from those who don't know it's actually just like a regular economy car. The engine is under powered but I think it definitely makes up for it in handling; being able to take corners at high speeds with pin point accuracy is fun. While I'd prefer a manual, the 6 speed CVT is lightning quick on its shifts but you don't feel anything. Interior is cheaply made, but you can make it better with personal mods. Overall a great car and I will be looking to upgrade to a manual Ralliart within the year.
"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Brittni, 03/12/2010,This is a great safe car!,5,"I'm 19 and I purchased my 09 lancer a little over a year ago and I was so happy with the car.  Recently i was in a 4 car accident and I was hit from behind, and also had front collision.  Not only did i enjoy and love the car but it did extremely  well holding up in the accident. All the airbags went off accordingly, and I was very happy with the  safety of the car  so much I'm going to get another!!!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,jamster3, 06/11/2015,Fun to Drive and Dependable!,4,"I bought my lancer brand new 6 years ago.  It has 110K miles and still runs great!  In that time, I took good care of it (nothing extreme), but I replaced the air filter at least once a year, changed the oil about every 5500 miles.  Have had 3 sets of tires, changed the front brakes and battery once.  Changed the transmission oil twice and that's about it.

I still get between 30-32 miles on the highway and about 22 around town.  The car has great torque for what it is.  Though it's not a luxury vehicle (especially the interior), when I'm at a stop light, sometimes it's hard to tell if the car is still running.  that's how good the engine still is."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,RalliartOwner, 05/05/2009,Awesome Car,4,"I've owned this car a couple months and love it.  Its 230hp keeps it as fast and fun as just about anything out there, while the 4 door design maintains practicality for passengers and other daily uses.  The shiftable automatic transmission is a joy when you want it to be.  The AWD keeps the car stuck to the road.  Standard technology includes bluetooth phone to make calls without taking your phone from your pocket and a ""FAST"" key remote sensor that enables you to unlock and start the car with the key in your pocket.  The exterior styling is fantastic."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Mitsi Problems, 04/03/2009,Powertrain Problems,3,"We bought this GTS in Oct 08 from Northside Mitsubishi in Edmonton. The car looked great and seemed to be fairly tight. We were pretty excited being our first new car for my wife. at 4000km, the rear main engine seal half way through a 1200km trip. The engine needed to be pulled and the seal replaced. Roadside assistance did nothing for us and we limped 600km to the dealership, filling oil every 50km. At 6400 the transmission started packing it in and will be going in for replacement on April 13th 2009. The company will do nothing for us other then repairing the major issues even when they struggle in today's market. Replacing the vehicle would be the solution, which they declined. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,yokohomme, 08/31/2012,"Bought in 2008 as new, and it's still drives like new",4,"I bought it new from MT dealer in 2008. 

Mine is 09 model es, and it's extremely reliable daily commute car. I personally think this car is way cheaper and better than competitive model Civic and Corolla. My car has put 82,000 miles and never had any single problems. Brakes and tires are very sturdy because I have neven replaced brakes still today."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,bfrost2, 02/17/2015,Awesome machine,4,"Alright so this car is absolutely worth the money, I commute 150 miles a day round trip and it runs strong with decent comfort. The only negatives Ive found with this car are if you live where it snows you WILL be jamming out your rims with a snow brush every time you get out of the car or drive around with the car shaking so bad you cant read the guages, it also doesn't do as well as promised on gas I average 23ish. You 100% want the rockford sound system and the CVT transmission is complete junk so buy a 5 speed. (traded my automatic back after 2 weeks because it was so annoying). Other than that this car is amazing and I may buy another one when trade in time rolls around."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,TicoRico, 03/04/2010,Ralliart Vs Evo,4,"I think this car is great for the money you spend. its 10 - 15 grand cheaper than any of the Evo's (GSR/MR/MR Touring) for a difference of 50 HP (larger turbo) and different suspension, rims, and a transmission (Taken from older EVO) Your spending most of that 10 - 15 grand on the name, and the small differences listed above. I wanted the Evo, but i didn't want to spend 40 grand on the MR touring. This car is a great deal for the money. You could take that 10-15 grand you saved and make it alot nicer and or faster if you wanted to. The car is quick and fun, it gets decent gas and is big enough for a family, and can drive anywhere due to its all wheel drive and traction control."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,sedanfanman, 07/01/2013,Amazing vehicle,4,"I bought my 2009 Mitsu Lancer ES back in July 2009 and 70K+ miles later, I still love it! I looked at similar vehicles while shopping but fell in love with the handling, performance, and value of this car. I've taken very good care of it and haven't had a single engine problem. My one complaint is the paint. Due to a design flaw there is an unusual amount of paint wear on the side skirts near the rear wheels. Countless chips all over the hood (which, yes, happens. But there is a lot more than normal). One time, while washing the car, I was scrubbing off a dead bug and a decent size paint chip came off with it! That should not happen! Regardless, I'd still recommend this car to everyone!"

Bad:

mitsubishi,lancer,2009,t-n-t, 05/31/2008,We love our gts!,4,Just bought. We really like it.  CVT good comp for husband and me. He wanted manual but I drive in the city so he can still have fun with the paddle shifters. Love the look and gadgets inside.
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Hallie, 06/17/2008,Proud Owner,5,I just purchased my first brand new car and am very happy with my choice. The GTS has everything that I would want in a car!
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,BellaCroix, 08/28/2008,One to add to your shopping list,4,"This was my first NEW car (7 miles at pick-up) - traded my Dodge Intrepid.  I don't know how many times I've noticed people checking the car out even a stranger at the gas station who struck up a conversation with me about the car.  It's an absolute dream to drive, a ton of fun and so packed with technology that it's like driving INSIDE a computer sometimes.  Highway MPG is very respectable, city isn't the greatest but isn't that bad either.  It's not a car to challenge other sport compacts to a race but if you're looking for a fun-to-drive car with enough get-up-and-go to get up and go this is worth adding to your short list."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Gordo, 01/10/2009,Better looking than the other imports,4,"This is one sweet ride, for the price. I've had it a month & it has never let me down, even in the snow. The only option I added was Bluetooth which is something I will not live without in my next purchase. I've tested Mitsu power plants for the past 10 years, in my 97 Neon & my 98 Dodge Stratus, both engines never let me down & I have over 275000kms on the Stratus. I believe I'll get as much if not more mileage on my Lancer "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,kazax01, 10/25/2012,Love this car,5,"One of the best car you can buy for less than 30K new.
Car is fast. AWD makes it any weather car.
Exterior is beautiful and aggressive. Got a lot of compliments.
Interior is nice, maybe not expensive materials but great quality."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,robert, 03/07/2010,great car,5,"I drive the car daily to work it is great fun to drive and handles great, also took it on a couple of road trips it did great in highway, mountains, rain, uneven roads, and slippery roads. Really dependable will highly recommend good acceleration and good break response. Never had chipping problems or any other issues."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Bob, 03/30/2010,Ralliart Experence,3,"I have had this car since June of 09 and drove for about 13,000 miles B 4 selling it. I do think it is important to give a review after having a car for awhile to get to know it. The Ralliart for the money was a good car. Built like a tank, quick, agile, and had good looks. It felt like you were driving around in a shell, road noise permeated the cabin, stock tires were very poor. The car improved greatly when they were replaced with Toyo T1R's. Handling and road noise were greatly reduced. Good car for the money but needs some refinements. Happy with it overall."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Rich, 07/23/2010,LOVE it!,4,"I simply love this car. After driving for over a year now (just slightly) I can honestly say I have only ONE gripe with the car, as many here already said: THE PAINT! It has to be one of the cheapest paints on the market. The second day after I bought it, I already had 4 or 5 chip  marks on my hood. And of course, paint is not on warranty. People saying this car is bad in the winter simply don't know HOW to drive in the winter, or don't buy winter tires. I live in Quebec, and I've had no problem what-so-ever in the winter. Also, my car eats Civic SIs for breakfast, on a straight line, AND in the curves. People saying otherwise are Honda fan-boys or Mitsu haters, that simple."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,porcrynd, 05/22/2008,Great Car,4,"Very satisfied with this car. 28 mpg in mixed driving, 33 hwy. Smooth suspension, very comfortable.  Great warranty, great features.  Very fun to drive and great looking. The Hondas and Toyotas are ugly.  Try one and you'll love it.  The CVT transmission just kills the power but it feels very peppy with the manual."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Jldixon, 10/06/2016,09 Lancer sports,4,"Very dependable,low maintenance and average interior. Has great reliability. Ownership since new.
"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,etipp98, 02/08/2009,Problems!,2,"I purchased this car thinking it would be reliable and would outlast all the American cars in the same price range. Well, I have owned the car for about 4 months now and am not pleased at all. The car looks great, gets good gas mileage, but works when it wants to. This past month I have had to take the car back to the dealership for the same problem. The car doesn't want to run in the cold and the engine starts to act erratically. The service engine light comes on and the same code keeps coming up, ""Torque Monitoring"". The Dealership says they cannot fix my car and neither can Mitsubishi at the moment so I am left with a car that is brand new and won't run in the cold weather. LEMON LAW!!!!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,winter wonderland, 02/17/2010,DONT BUY IF IN SNOWY STATES,3,"I love my new Lancer but there are flaws that i have noticed. Because i live in Maine we sand and salt the roads in the winter. This sand and salt has been chipping away at my paint. It is chipping off in front of my rear tires. Much of the paint is worn off and because it is the design and paint is not under warranty i have to fight and i don't think i will win. I did buy Mud guard prior to all the paint chipping, but the mud guards only drop like and inch. In snow storms it STINKS the tires don't grip i think it is because there is not a lot of weight but. The seats are hard and the arm rest is half the size that i am use to. i have realized that the car kinda jerks when you go up a hill anyrpm"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Me, 06/29/2008,Awesome,5,"Bought the car yesterday, didn't want a dull looking family sedan. Wow, turns heads, stereo and navi is awesome. Black with tint and all options. Love it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Eddie, 02/22/2009,Mitsu,4,"Car runs great. Should've gotten the GTS since it has more power than the ES- Sport, but there is plenty of space between the engine and the firewall to add a few extra horses under the hood."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,goreyno88, 01/24/2012,2009 Lancer GTS reliability,3,"I bought my 2009 Lancer GTS in July 2009, it was running good until it reaches 39700K miles and my clutch just gave up.
I took my Lancer to El Cajon Mitsubishi and was told that my plywheel was worn out due to a regular wear and tear.
So I ask if it is still covered by warranty but the service advisor said it is not covered by the powertrain warranty since it is not part of the powertrain.
So I have no choice except to pay $ 1,700 to replace the clutch plywheel.
I have a 1996 Honda Accord but I have never had a transmission problem since I bought it.
I would strongly recommend to consumer Look at Honda first before going to Mitsubishi."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,bolshevik, 03/26/2013,One of the worst cars ever,1,"I bought this car used with little mileage, after a few months I've had to put around a thousand dollars in fixes to it. I had to clean the engine because it was clogged, it has instability problems when accelerating over 60 miles (it vibrates), I had to replace a valve and some other engine internals because they were damaged, had to do injection system cleaning, and the worst of all I have to add oil to it on a constant basis because it just simply consumes a ridiculous amount of oil.

My other car a Toyota Yaris 2008 has over 115K (I drive it hard and a lot) and I haven't spent a SINGLE DOLLAR except on the normal oil and tire maintenance which I do by the book."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Wolfman, 05/30/2008,Outstanding car,5,"Got my new Mitsu 2 days ago and I love it. Test drove 5 other cars that are comparable and this one was the best by far. GOOD JOB MITSUBISHI. Just hope you keep it up. The car has some amazing safety (good for my kids) features and lots of toys. It totally blew away most of the competition and at 6 foot 6 I enjoy the roomy interior. Lots of toys as well... Satellite radio, Blue Tooth, awesome stereo, and sunroof... Excellent warranty which gives me (new father of 2) peace of mind. Sales people were awesome as well. Let the car sell itself. They did not have any theatrics, drama, scripted tag teaming, etc.. Highly recommend the dealership. Great car and again, thanks Mitsubishi. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,joey, 06/24/2008,Great car,4,I own several cars and this was my latest buy. This is a very impressive car. Has a lot of toys and gadgets that make the car very fun to drive
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,ANGEL, 07/04/2008,Great Car!,4,"I love my Lancer.  I went to the dealership not thinking that this car would be what I wanted,  and I actually had an appt. with an Infiniti dealer the same day.  After test driving this car I fell in love with it.  The pickup is great in the 2.4 and the ride is quiet. I have the dark gray and people think it's the small BMW! I trade my cars in every 2-3 year (lease) and always went for the high end 6 cylinder cars.  This car is just as good if not better.  I love driving it, the ride is really wonderful!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Gene Nigrelli, 07/14/2008,Wow!,5,I can't believe that you can purchase a vehicle with all of these features for such a low price. Electronics are outstanding.
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,zontar19, 07/13/2008,Must test drive!!,4,"I bought this car a few weeks ago and am loving it! It handles and looks like a much more expensive car. Everywhere i go i get looks and compliments. It's way faster than I expected for it only being a 4 banger! I'm not getting as good of fuel mileage as im supposed to but apparently this car slowly gets better mileage as it breaks in, hope that's true."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,RallyRed09GTS, 07/24/2008,Awesome car but lacks something,4,"Mitsu could have made a winner with this lancer but have fallen short of the process. It has the looks, the killer instinct and presence that tends to say get out of the way am going through. Has all the bark but lacks some bite. It's not as slow as some people tends to believe. If it want to go fast it certainly can. It lacks acceleration though.  Highly recommended for freeway driving (goes fast and gives decent MPG). Hate it on City driving (horrible MPG). Don't get me wrong, I love my car and I have it for 4 months now. Just wish Mitsu made it a little better"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Boshi, 07/29/2008,Fun and Affordable,4,"The GTS is nicely equipped for a vehicle under 25k with nice pick up and go especially in the midrange rpm. The interior is fairly sleek with blue accent instrument panel. The 9 speaker Rockford stereo system definitely thumps with a 10"" woofer in the trunk. The mileage is pretty good for highway driving. I've been averaging 28 mpg which is what i was getting on my ford focus but this car definitely has the fierce look to it. A real head turner. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,fan4life08, 08/16/2008,Wow,4,This is my first brand new car I have ever had. I gave up my 2003 Pontiac Vibe for this wonderful car. I do work for carmax so I had a general idea of the competition for this car and I have to say that once I jumped in this car that I had no planned on buying I just bought it. What a great car. I'm very happy and I look forward to driving it everyday. It's quiet on the highway and seems to be pretty comfortable. My first tank of gas was 26 mpg driving in a mixed driving environment. I'm sure it will do 30 no problem on the highway. Great car if your looking for a new car under 15. I'd rather have this than a civic or a corolla.
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,J-What, 08/18/2008,2009 Lancer GTS,5,I just recently purchased a 2009 Lancer GTS loaded. It's great fun to drive extremely perky 5 speed.  My only complaint is it doesn't have a leather option and the 5 speed could easily be converted into a 6 speed which would be a lot more efficient! The car is great the performance on it is extremely good for a 168 HP 4 cylinder (beat my gf's 08 mustang (it's automatic)) the fuel economy is far better than what it's rated at! I can draft behind a semi on the highway going about 60 and get up to 45 MPG (instant icon read 50 once or twice) but it overall is an extremely fun car to drive and I would recommend it to anyone! The car is a little heavy but it handles like a dream! No cheap feel either
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Dean, 09/02/2008,Awesome car great handling,5,"When I first test drove the car off the lot, I was hooked.  The car turns on a dime and has minimum body roll.  The 2.4 L engine is a improvement from last year.  The extra horsepower if perfect for the 4,000 lb gross weight of the car.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,bassist48, 09/14/2008,Love my lancer,4,"I didn't choose this car. this car chose me. after 2 minutes into the test drive, the car was sold. it is extremely fun to drive with a tight turning circle and a performance tuned suspension. CVT transmission is great; very smooth. 2.4 liter sounds awesome and provides good acceleration. the car rides like a beemer; quiet in the city and on the highway with very little road, engine, or wind noise. I got it fully loaded with the nav, 650 watt sound system, FAST key, stability control and HID auto headlights. gas mileage is not the greatest, but the car makes up for it with how fun to drive it is. would recommend to any/everybody."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,trol1374, 09/19/2008,love it,4,"I knew about the low armrest in center and on door.  However, I still loved the car.  Nice sporty look and feel.  The car drives great.  The gas mileage could be slightly better, but all is still good.  The GTS vs the ES drive is night and day.  The ES motor feels like it is winding up and going to snap, the GTS sounds great while accelerating.  If you get that sweet spot on where to rest your arm, then you will enjoy the car.  Knobs are well laid out.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,CHensley58, 09/23/2008,A Real Quality Car with Perks!,5,"Ok, I just bought a brand spanking new Lancer as stated above. I just love this car. I've always been more on the bigger longer taller cars but if you're looking for a super fun to drive sporty fuel saving compact then this car is in a complete league of its own. I would recommend this car 110%. I looked and test drove many of cars before making my final decision. This car beats them all. From driving to listening to your favorite tunes to just doing everyday running, you just have to drive one to know what all of these reviews are saying. How many other cars do you see where none of the reviews can really find any real problems with the car? None that I have seen! Just buy one ;-)"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,darkness, 09/25/2008,The best car in its class,5,"I have had it for about two weeks now. And this car is awesome. Turning is awesome, get up and go is good. And don't forget all about the toys inside. Satellite radio is great. The nav is very accurate. All in all a great car inside and out."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,myself, 10/02/2008,my first new car,5,"Well I went to the dealership to buy a Kia Sportage. Then I found out that it was too small, and that I wanted something more sporty. I found the Mitsubishi lancer. And I loved driving for the first 5 miles, then before I got back to the dealership I new that it was my own car already. Its a fast one, with a lot of nice stuff. I got the sport package and the sun & sound package with the bluetooth, for only 19,300! I was looking at a Honda Civic coupe but the lancer is so much more worth it. And its a perfect size for a girl too! "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,lhvang, 10/22/2008,Impressive Car,4,"I own the GTS 4-door sedan CVT.  First off, I have owned my car for a little over 2 months now.  This car is great overall.  I have the nav package w/sun and sound, and those things are just amazing.  Don't get the car without it.  The bluetooth for mobile phones isn't perfect, but it's a great addition to the car.  People can hear me clearly, just at a low volume.  Also, the car handles like a dream.  I haven't driven it in snow, but it's great in the rain.  I've driven other cars in rain and always feel like I'm going to lose control, but not with this car.  Also, the mpg is better than the advertised value.  I am averaging 28 mpg city driving.  This car is one that's worth checking out!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Brendon, 10/18/2008,WOW! This car is amazing.,5,"I bought this 2009 Lancer GTS Automatic.  First, for what you are paying, this car is truly incredible.  I've research the others and read other reviews, the reviews speak for this car.  I traded my 06 corolla in for it and will never own another 'yota after this car.  For approx. $17200 out the door I got this car loaded and for what I paid, blows the competition out the door.  I drove easy on my way home from the dealership and averaged 32.1 MPG, going about 60-70 MPH, not bad at all, I drive easy however.  All I can say is, Mitsubishi, awesome job.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Xavier, 10/28/2008,Amazing car!,4,"It's an incredible car, I have it since last week and already I can tell you it was the best choice I could have taken. I love the car."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,oregonguy, 11/01/2008,Sweet car,4,"Bought my car a week ago and love it.  Got the car with sun and sound along with navigation.  I suggest that you get all these features.  The touring package is probably a waste of 1,000 bucks.  Best handling car I've driven.  Comfortable seats and great feel for fabric only interior.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,What a ride, 11/08/2008,What a ride,4,"When I started looking for a new car I wasn't sure what I wanted. I drove the corolla, the sentra, and this little baby. I knew that I wanted a strippo to get the price down and I was blown away with this car. It's relatively quiet, it has a fair amount of power and never feels slow on its feet. The thing that sold the car for me was the ride. It's never choppy and I could relate it more to a big car then anything else in its class. The clutch and the transmission is very smooth and easy to operate and to me feels like a manual transmission should. Being that I do live in the midwest I did have to pay the extra money for the A/C which was well worth it. Give it shot."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,AbbyB, 11/20/2008,I love my new GTS!,5,I bought this car on Saturday and I absolutely love it!
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Noman, 11/21/2008,An Awsome Ride,4,I was driving Corolla 2007. Also have driven civic. When I came here and saw the shape it was like love at first sight. However I must say it was the test drive and exterior shape due to which I bought this car. Fun to drive and very comfortable to sit in.
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,njcontreraz, 11/23/2008,I WOULD HAVE PAID ANOTHER $5000,5,"I think this is a fine buy for anyone looking at value.  Mitsubishi has to be one of the most underrated automakers. The Lancer has great pickup, good handling in the snow, and a smooth ride all around.  I looked around and did a lot of research on other cars in this class (including some above) and this won by a mile as far as price and value.  Give it a drive and you will be convinced."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Jon Pogi, 12/04/2008,"Smooth to drive, really a sport feeling.",5,"I got this last Nov and when I got it there is a small dent and the dealer was aware about it and verbally they told me that they will fix it and even give me a loaner car. Now they are giving me a hard time to have it fixed and the 6 CD is missing not even there. The specs on the paper, 6CD/MP3 is the deck w/ navigation."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Drew, 12/07/2008,The First Ralliart in the Southeast,4,"I owned my car for about 24 hours and I know that's not quite long enough to know all the in and outs. But this thing is amazing.  I driven an Evo, and for the $10,000 price cut, this will not disappoint. One thing though good luck finding one."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,brendan norris, 12/17/2008,2009 Lancer GTS!,5,I love this car!  It has good low end power and can get going when needed on the highway.  The only thing I would change is to add traction control for the snow.  One way you can get around this is to put the car into the shifting mode and when you push the gas shift up into third gear and it goes okay.
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Rolando, 12/19/2008,My 2009 Lancer GTS,4,"I just leased the 2009 Lancer GTS and looked at other compact, but sporty vehicles in this class, and I am sorry, there is no comparison.  The exterior and interior are ""A"" class and the other dealers do not have anything that comes close. This is a keeper!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Mike, 12/21/2008,Sold at First Sight,4,"My previous car, an '02 Hyundai Elantra broke down so I decided to trade it in.  I had been researching new cars and had considered this as well as the Suzuki SX4.  Test drove my Lancer and I was hooked.  I got the GTS with the standard stereo, no nav.  I kinda wished I had gotten it but I couldn't justify the extra cost.  As far as the performance, the car is quick and handles great.  The tires seem to be the limiting factor.  Everywhere I have looked people criticize the Dunlops for their lack of traction, especially in the snow. The car is comfortable and drives great.  The gas mileage is awesome.  Its better than the mileage I would get in the Hyundai, even though that engine was smaller."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Pantera, 01/01/2009,"Fun in summer, bad in winter",4,"First off I bought this car back in may. I really liked zipping around in this little car during the summer but then winter has come along and I can honestly say that this is the worst vehicle I have driven in the snow. The car does have decent pickup but I think it could use a little more HP. If you live in a warm climate and want a fun little car to zip around in then this one is for you. My best mpg is 29 on the highway and I usually average around 17 in town. Seats are comfy but the ride can be rough at times also. Overall I would love to have this car in Florida or California, just not in the Midwest."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Troy, 01/05/2009,So Far So Good!,4,"We've had our Lancer for six months. So far, not one complaint. No problems of any kind, and more importantly, we love to drive! It's got a tight ride, (glued to the road), takes a beating on terrible city roads, is peppy and looks sexy. It has more than adequate power and with the kicking sound system, it's more than fun to drive. I've bought 8 cars new since my 1982 driver's license, and by far I'm happiest with this one the most."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,jenniewray, 01/20/2009,"Some Good, Some Bad",4,"When we first got the Lancer in mild weather it was fantastic - we felt like we were driving a luxury car! We first noticed an issue with the radio/speakers a few months ago. The radio didn't actually start to make noise until the dial was at 15. Last week, anytime anything other than talk radio the speakers are now crackling. Since winter started the rear door windows are taking FOREVER to defrost (over an hour) and interior parts are rattling (locks on the doors, back window, silver stripe on the passenger door). We called the dealership and they told us there was nothing they could do about the rattling or the defrost issues as when it gets cold that's what happens. Nice response! "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Denise, 01/26/2009,Disappointed,3,"I love the look of the car but the interior is very cheaply put together. The trunk area almost looks like its not finished from the factory.  I live in Ohio and this is my first winter - let's just say it's going to be a long five years with this car.  It definitely needs traction control.  I neglected to ask about that when I purchased the car, needless to say had I known how poorly it would handle in the snow and ice would have never purchased it.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,scuderiams, 01/30/2009,Lancer GTS Sun & Sound Silver,5,"I just bought this car and it's amazing. I got the Sun & Sound package and it's worth every dollar. The performance is great for a 2.4l. I like the CVT with the paddle shifters. Fuel consumption it's good, not the best one but it's good and better than my previous car. Hands free system works great. The exterior design is great, it's an eye catcher. Handling and suspension work great together."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,AGKB, 01/31/2009,Great little car for a great value!,4,"I bought this car to escape the crazy gas prices a while back.  This car is the best bang for the buck.  I looked at a lot of cars in its class and none came close; most (Civic, Mazda3, etc.) were more expensive with less options.  You can't find a better car loaded with these options at this price.  This car is much better looking too; looks like Bimmers, Audis and Volvos in the 40- 50K range!  Not thrilled with the performance from 0-30, after that, it's great. I chose the CVT (convenience) over performance.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Dan, 03/27/2009,Best bang for the buck right now!,4,"I've had this car now for about 9 months and am very happy.  Eye-catching exterior and the interior is nice.  It runs great and I'm getting 30-35 mpg on the highway!  The CVT takes getting used to and the engine is a bit loud.  In normal city driving, it feels as if the transmission is slipping but you eventually get used to the CVT.  If you need to get up to speed fast, the paddle shifters give you everything you need WHEN you need it!  Sun and sound package is a GREAT upgrade!  My biggest gripe is the rather large rear spoiler- it blocks your rear view quite a bit.  Overall, a very nice car at a good price."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,steven, 03/29/2009,6 month update,4,"Well, I have owned this car for six month's now and it's been pretty good although I have had some issues in which iv'e had to return to the dealer for. As with any car there are pro's and con's. However, there are more pro's than con's with this lancer ES CVT. The pro's are great handling, very sharp looking, great mpg, good power, and a very quiet interior. I did have a few issues early on with the trunk light not working and the rear airbags cover came loose from the clips that held them in place. But those issues were fixed at the dealership. I traded in a 08 Honda Civic LX and I enjoy the Lancer much better. It handles better, and looks better and is more quiet interior and has more power."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Jim, 04/25/2009,Rather Pleased,4,"This is the first Mitsubishi I have ever owned. So far after 1000 miles it drives pretty well. No problems yet. I am getting very good mileage. Up to 34 mpg on the highway. Rarely do I get less then 27/28 mpg anywhere. Smooth ride and not too noisy. Yes, it's a bit underpowered but I can live with that for better mileage. Overall a nice car and fun to drive. The price was good too. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,cbull25, 04/27/2009,Just wait....,4,"I bought my Lancer in July, and like all of you, was very excited about the look, ride, value, and features.  That is until I washed and waxed it after a few months.  The paint on the rear side panels chips like you would not believe.  I searched on the internet and found so many other Lancer owners that this is happening to as well.  WHAT A BUMMER!!!!  If I would've known the condition that the paint would be in after only 6 months, I wouldn't even have considered a Lancer.  Oh yeah, you guessed it...""It is not a defect with the vehicle design or paint, so it is not covered under warranty."" Normal road wear....you've got to be kidding."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,bpd295, 05/01/2009,Too bad for the paint job,4,"After owning the vehicle for six months, the paint in the rear quarter panels is chipping by the rear doors.  I took this to the dealer and they nearly laughed at me.  The service manager encouraged me to file a fraudulent insurance claim to so that they could get compensated and repaint the vehicle for me.  Body shop people stated that this is a design flaw and a lot of Lancer's are having this problem.  I was actually told to just budget for body work every year.  Such a shame because I love the car otherwise."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,HK416, 05/06/2009,Less than impressed after a year,3,"I have had my Lancer GTS for nearly a year and let's just say - it is going away.  The power is not bad; but heaven forbid you have to use the A/C. It sucks SO much power from the engine. Mileage is as expected, but I can't get over the complete lack of power in this thing.  Interior is not all bad; seats could be a bit more comfortable on longer trips.  The NAV system is alright; but how about some updates for the maps?  My house is over 2 yrs old and my street doesn't even show up.  When I called Mitsubishi about updates; they told me this summer w/ a cost of $100 - are you serious?  It will be a happy day when she is gone from my garage."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,CK8408, 05/10/2009,Good Car/Good Value,5,"I purchased this car on April 30th as my first new car after graduating college. I considered the Subaru Impreza and Mazda 3 but was blown away by the price, standard features, and performance of the Lancer. The 5 speed is fun and smooth. The engine could have more power, but with average 28-30 mpg I can't complain. Build quality seems to be great so far. The ES comes standard with many nice features such as steering wheel mounted audio controls and alloy wheels. You don't need to spend a lot of money to get a great looking Lancer. The ES comes standard with many great features. Sure there are always improvements, but for the price it's hard to beat. I highly recommend it.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Joe Guo, 05/08/2009,A Hi-Tech Delight,4,"I was in the market for a fun-to-drive compact car with A/T. I liked the GTI's power and paddle shifters, the Civic EX-L with its stylish exterior, and the Zoom-zoom feedback from the 2010 Mazda3 hatchback GT. However, I've found that the perfect combination of these features exists on a Lancer GTS, with all three available packages (sun & sound, technology and touring). Sure, it hasn't got the power of a GTI, but who redlines their cars on a daily basis? It handles just like a Mazda3 with lots of excitement, and it looks much better than all of the above mentioned models. At a price tag of a mere 22500 (w/rebates&tax), I can see myself smiling and enjoying this sweet ride for years to come."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Chris, 06/04/2009,Great Car,5,"I've had the car for about 3 weeks now and could not be happier. Was able to get the 0% financing promo too, which saved me thousands over the term of the loan. The car handles great and is just fun to drive. I highly recommend the manual transmission, its smooth hydraulic clutch and short throw shifts really add some fun to the daily drives to work. Also the appearance package is a must, it gives the car a great aggressive look. The leather wrapped steering wheel has a great feel and quality to it. I think there is plenty of pickup to the 2.0. I passed on the GTS because of the 18in rims and performance tires. I live in NY I didn't want to have to buy snow tires and switch them on every year. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,lispfixer, 07/06/2009,A sweet little ride,4,"I bought my 2009 Lancer GTS in 2008.  I was shopping for a used, more fuel efficient car, as I was driving a BMW SUV. I miss having the SUV, but not filling it up with gas! I call my Lancer my little techno-bile.  That's why I bought it for all the latest ""stuff""-really the bluetooth. The sound system is great, but I miss having the Bose that my Infiniti had.  For the Lancer price loaded, you can't touch a BMW or Infiniti.  I miss the leather seating.  Love the Octane Blue color. Got a special coating put on it (aftermarket) to save the paint from chipping and fading.  Good investment. I also added a billet grill, as I thought the plastic grill was ""cheezy- looking"". "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,gtarb0rder, 08/03/2009,I'm impressed,5,"I bought this car a week ago using the ""cash for clunkers"" deal. I wanna add that the deal is a real pain but worth it. Ultimately this was an awesome buy, great car for the money. Its fun to drive, amazing looking, handles well, I'm averaging 26 mpgs and the warranties are great. What I have to complain about it the rear spoiler, although adds to the aggressive look I love, its does become a pain when looking in my mirror. Also this car needs a 6th gear, but then again what car doesn't? I'm so glad I got this over the Impreza, I just hope my opinion stays that way come winter."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Chris, 07/30/2009,2009 Lancer,4,"Positive: Very stylish with nice exterior and interior, great handling and braking. The ac works great. Fuel economy around 25 mpg in mix driving.  Negative: Noisy, acceleration could be better"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Bishop, 08/11/2009,Great Car for the Price,4,The car drives & handles great. Put 3k miles on it in the 1st 3wks we had it w/ not one issue! MPG was better than advertised. 32 mpg w/ the A/C on most of the time! That's from Calif to Colorado and back. Great hands free Bluetooth system. Cruse Control works well and the stereo is not bad for a stock system. 
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,09lancer, 08/14/2009,2009 Lancer,4,"Love the car so far.  Graphite Gray.  Had an old car with a huge V8.  Gas mileage is not perfect but much better than old car by a large margin.  Interior has nice style but the quality does lack behind.  I thought interior in GTS was better than the ES model.  It is a comfortable car for me, I'm 5""10.  Spoiler does block the view but you get used to it.  For a 4 cyl it is pretty powerful, but it could have more power.  The back seat has a decent amount of room along with the trunk for a compact sedan.  Overall a pretty decent car for the price.  Got mine for a great deal so can't complain.  If looking for a cheaper compact sedan that has a little bit of sportiness, the Lancer is for you."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,TONYSSAM, 09/01/2009,Should you buy it,4,"The lancer drives very well. It's as quiet as any of it's competitors, as corolla, etc. It soaks up most of the bumps with minimum effect in the passenger car. It's engine, a dohc with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and it's continuously variable transmission both work to make the ride pleasant. I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable, with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use. The car is very safe and sturdy - uses very strong steel. The only flaw is that the epa fuel economy is already below it's competitors and below the prior generation lancer 2007. And when you drive it - it seems like it's below the epa estimates also - especially city."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,kleo84, 09/18/2009,Fuel Milage,4,"I disagree with the other people saying the fuel mileage is bad. i drove this car from Kileen, Texas to Colorado Springs and averaged around 33-35mpg!!! Both trips. The only thing I don't really like about the base models is the HP. It shoulda been upped a little compared to the newer 4cyl. N/A cars out there, but nice car looks mean in the front."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,BC, 09/25/2009,A Phenominal Value for the $ (tempered),4,"This is an amazing car for what it is. Value and character. For one of the few AWD cars on the market with a straight 4 and the turbo provides amazing power from 20-120+mph and is a dead accurate vehicle. Shifts are precise, engine is solid, turbo  is ample. Just a true joy to drive when you are in the mood. However, it's not a great highway cruiser or Sunday driver, it's a harsh and loud ride with little insulation and driver amenities. I use this car for a 65 mile commute daily (round trip) and it has its downfalls. Noise, moderate fuel mileage, VERY SMALL GAS TANK and loud overall with performance tires. But it is what it is: performance car with  power to spare & character to match!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Ball, 10/01/2009,Sweet deal for the price,4,"I bought my car just over a year ago and I have no complaints about it. I hear some that say it doesn't live up to the fuel economics, but I drove from San Diego to Washington averaging 31 mpg. If that's not good enough for you then buy a prius. Car has been great and everything that I bought it for. Fun to drive and decent power for how much it weighs. Wish I would have waited for the Ralliart. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Chris, 11/15/2009,Fun but slightly problematic,3,"This car is solid, I've never had this much fun driving before, the handling and suspension are amazing and just taking a corner is an experience. Fuel Economy is fairly good when you're not too busy having with it. This car also has a few problems. I've had my clear coat start to come off, constant rattling in the car from when it's unlocked, very bad road noise and other tad bits. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,karron, 12/12/2009,Mitsubishi GTS,4,"Love Mitsubishis. Bought GTS on Government's cash for clunkers program. Love the handling, this thing handles, really is a joy to drive, & being a woman don't think I drive slow. Best looking car in its class, always get lots of positive comments about it."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Amanda, 01/08/2010,Not impressed,3,"If you live where there is snow, do not get this car! It tends to get stuck, even on the roads. It does not get any traction to get started, just wants to veer all over the road. Also, when trying to stop on slippery roads, it pulls the car hard left or right. I went from a 2007 Civic SI to a 2009 Lancer GTS, the Civic had tons more power and got tons better gas mileage.  Very upset with the whole car. The seats are extremely uncomfortable when taking a trip longer than 30 minutes also."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Dan, 02/17/2010,Very satisfied,3,"I thought I'd update my review after 18 months of driving mine.  I'm still very satisfied with this car- very sporty, great exterior looks, and excellent mileage.  I don't know how other people are driving but I'm still getting 30 hwy. and 25 city.  My biggest gripe after having this car for a while- THE PAINT!!!!!!  Geez, you can't drive thru a dust cloud without the dust scratching this paint!  Please, use a better paint/clearcoat Mitsubishi! All in all, I'd still give this car an overall solid 8."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,savvyguy, 03/02/2010,Decent car for the price,4,"This is a review based on 5 months of driving. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The styling was a major appeal, plus it does very well on corners. The only gripe I have about this car would be --> the paint <--, thin metal ( i have a few dents already), cheesy interior, and some-what slow performance from the cvt. The gas mileage was decent, about 23/30. Although I can't complain much since I got the car with the S&S and Nav for 22k OTD."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Keith, 03/08/2010,Worth the money,4,"I absolutely love my Lancer GTS because it is wicked nice looking and really just a blast to drive. However, I heard about the paint wearing around the back tires prior to buying it so I decided I'd get the mud guards and keep it real clean even in the winter. I would never let too much salt cake on it and yet I still see the paint fading there. COME ON MITSUBISHI! I also noticed the speaker covers vibrate a bit excessively though I do like the sound system. All in all I'd still highly recommend this car I would just suggest it in white or silver so you don't notice the paint wear as much."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,asharobinson, 11/15/2011,Mitsubishi Lancer Paint Issues,3,"I was initially overjoyed with my purchase of a 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer but soon noticed thousands of chips in the exterior paint. I first contacted my insurance company who said that it was a manufacturer defect and will be covered by warranty. Agreeing because of the large number of chips, I reviewed my warranty booklet and followed protocol. When the service manager shared that corporate has been choosing to ignore the paint issue I began looking further into it online. I was not alone.
Mitsubishi responded taking no responsibility for the defective paint.
I've also had issues with starting the vehicle which Mitsubishi blamed on the quality of gas."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,mross77, 01/18/2012,Fun and Good Value,4,"I bought my 2009 GTS used about six months ago and am really enjoying it so far.
The 5 speed stick has plenty of power and is quite quick.
Handling is very surefooted with little body lean and poised direction changes.
Braking with the 4 wheel discs is excellent.
Quick, short stops, zero fade and pretty good pedal feel.
I would recommend the Sun and Sound package as the Rockford Fosgate stereo alone is well worth the money - far and away the best sound in any vehicle I've owned.
I get 22 or 23 mpg around town and 31 on longer trips - not awesome but certainly respectable.
Nice roominess front and back for a smaller car and good ability to carry lots of stuff."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,loanshark_08, 04/14/2012,Almost 3 years going ...thats a record,4,"I must say this car is worth my money so far. Most American cars I buy are usually in the shop more than I get
to drive then trade them in and become upside down. In July it will be year 3 and that is the longest I have owned a car. This car gets me all over Texas as well as a daily commuter. The only negative I can say is it randomly won't start but then will fire right up. I thought it was a fuel filter but much to my surprise this car only has one in the fuel pump in the gas tank? Upgraded the sound system and w/ Bluetooth makes it one awesome lil car. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Adrian, 03/19/2008,09 lancer gts,5,I just bought this car yesterday and I love it! This car is very roomy and comfortable. It has nice interior and a nice body. The upgraded engine is the icing on the cake. It is awesome.
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Kdoske, 03/27/2008,Best Value of 09,4,"This car is great. I got mine fully loaded and I LOVE IT. Its spacious and has a great looking interior.  2.4L vice 2.0L engine definitely shows some gain, but not enough for anyone that has an 08 to go out and trade theirs in for the 09 model.  It drives fantastic all while not being to stiff over rough terrain. It really is a great balance between comfort and sharp maneuverability on the road.  Navigation option really puts the icing on the cake with this car. Its navigation computer is so incredible I cant even believe it is on a car at this price range. All I can say it wow! "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Kevin, 04/02/2008,Top of its class,4,"This is the first new car I have ever owned.  I have to say I'm very happy. The engine is a great balance between performance and efficiency, the 5 speed is smooth, good brakes, and is LOADED with features.  I have an ES with the sun and sound and sport package.  I wanted a GTS, but got a good deal, it has everything but the 18"" rims and the 2.4L.  The interior is minimal, yet attractive and roomy.  I love the stereo and steering wheel controls.  No other car in its class can compare.  I drove an 09 Corolla, for the same price it had 15"" hubcaps!  And the transmission sucked as it was slooooow.  This car is beautiful and has a great warranty.  I cant recommend this car enough.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,idlewanderlust, 04/28/2008,Had an 08 Now 09,4,"Traded in my 08 Lancer GTS for the 09 GTS, this is a much improved Lancer over the year. The HP gain is nice but what really helps is the torque gain. The care will actually pull you from a stop and has the needed thrust when entering the highway. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Vic, 05/07/2008,Best in its class,4,"Gorgeous car, gets a lot of attention. Drives very smooth, handles great and I love the response from the breaks. It has a great turning radius as well. This car is definitely not cookie-cutter, you won't see it along with all the Camrys and Civics, it's unique all the way from it's exterior to it's features. Great buy, I couldn't be happier!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,ajkassay, 11/12/2011,Great car! with a couple gripes,4,"I got this car used almost 2 years ago with 12k miles. now, with 35k miles, its still great. haven't had a single issue with it yet. gas mileage isn't the best, but it's fine. driving this car is great, the confident handling makes this car pleasing to drive. I just wish the engine had just a bit more power, and a little more quiet, but it gets the job done. I also love the interior and the rockford fosgate sound system, it's one of the things that make this car such a great value. However, my biggest complaint is the paint. It's terrible! It scratches very easily, which gets frustrating over time. And since i live in a hot climate, im worried about the suns toll on the paint."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Octane, 05/22/2008,Great all-around package!!!,5,"I just purchased the 2009 Lancer GTS with CVT transmission, navigation system, and Rockford Fosgate sound system. The car handles like a dream, is so fun to drive it is unreal, and the fuel economy is great so far. Mitsubishi has developed this car with excellent design inside and out. The tech features are amazing for this price range. I am very happy with this car!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,driveboston, 11/04/2011,Best Choice Under 20K,4,"I've owned this car for 2 years and 4 months, and have put 40k miles on it, so I feel it's kind of safe to say I made a wise choice that picked this car from this price range and bought it. Driving experience is very sporty. I espacially like the steering wheel which is tight enough and very accurate (hard to find on other cars I tried under 20k). Reliability is excellent, zero problem since I bought it and all I need is oil change every 3 months. Interior is no fancy leather seat or luxury things, but you can clearly feel Mitsubishi put the money saved here into things you don't see under engine hood. Overall this car is not comparable to bmw or infiniti, but best choice under 20k IMO."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Jamie, 05/25/2008,"Price, quick, safety, mileage, extras!",5,"Awesome, A looker, and so many air bags I forgot how many! Fun to drive, can't get enough. Never get lost again, No more CD's as they simply burn right into your library in 2 hot minutes, So much more."
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Mike, 05/26/2008,09 GTS 2.4l Lancer with 5 spd is AWESOME!,5,"I have owned the car for about a month now.  I got the 5spd manual with the sun/sound package and the navigation.  I love the car so far.  It has all the technology and features I wanted in a car.  I was considering used BMWs, audis, acuras, etc. but when it comes down to it, this is a much more unique car and very fun to drive.  I love that all the features and technology will last me at least 4 years of enjoyment while I drive the car too and from work.  Some of those used BMWs didnt even have ipod hookups, i can't deal with that, lol.  Anyways this is a sick car and is a blast to drive.  Great warranty and overall good deal when you compare run of the mill cars like the civic and corolla"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,chief, 05/26/2008,Better than expected!!,4,"I'm a truck guy, I bought this for my wife because I didn't want a ""family"" car. I couldn't even think of parking a Corolla, Camry, Sentra or whatever else in my garage. I love the aggressive styling. It's fast, don't get the wrong idea, using the paddle shifters will push you back in the seat and get you to triple digits fairly quick, I mean, after all it is a 4 cyl. We got octane blue, which is great looking in the sun. Fully loaded, every option available. Even had the dealer tint the windows and the car looks even better now! If you're on the fence, go drive one, you will buy!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,g0lfballer, 09/21/2019,miss the 09' Ralliart,4," i got the 09' Ralliart new after 03' Evo VIII needed an engine & stuff. decided to just switch up. very fun for a ""budget Evo"" type thing I'm glad Mitsu made. I wish they still made them especially since they dropped the Evo, at least keep the Ralliart turbo lancer, & add a stick option gosh! anyways I wish could have kept it. payments were high even tho I got a demo heavily discounted. but neg equity from trade in didn't help, & work situation changed. I'm open to getting a Lancer GTS,ES or another Ralliart if could find it. & they are much cheaper used now. The Evo nostalgia puts all of their used car prices in ridiculous territory for the age & mechanical wear. sub-10k for these other trims is reasonable, likely gonna throw it away in 5-10yrs anyway.
"
mitsubishi,lancer,2009,Lorenzo, 09/08/2020,2009 ES,4,"The car has been in the family since 2010 without a problem. We've done all regular maintenance - oil changes, tires, breaks etc. The car runs great with no problems. Fuel efficiency is best when the car is packed empty on the highway. In the city it can be a little more iffy.

mitsubishi,lancer,2010,senatejs24, 07/25/2010,2010 Lancer GTS (CVT),4,I love this car the dealer was awesome handled and new the cars very well was actually looking at a 2010 lancer Es model before they threw this car into the loop. It handles nice on turns and looks stylish.
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,jazket, 02/02/2010,"Incredibly reliable, a blast to drive!",4,"I bought a Lancer Ralliart in February 2009 and I now have 20,000 miles on it. I just can't stop driving it. It's impressive for 26,000 I paid I got A LOT of car. I rather drive my Ralliart than my brother's Benz C300 (unless I'm on a road trip of course) it's incredibly fun. Mitsubishi is really overlooked as a brand, and this car should be on your list when searching for a sporty sedan, it took last year's IntelliChoce for Best Overall Sport Sedan under $35,000, and well deserved!  If you're into modding you won't be let down unless you really want to go big which is where the marvelous TC-SST fails, it's still in its early stages and it won't hold more than 300wlbs-torque!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,karkai6, 05/29/2014,Not Bad for the price,4,"Got the car used at 36k miles.. Got it relatively cheaper than the other cars in the same range out there..

The gearbox is among the better ones I have used and the throw feels very slick.. The performance is not very bad, but then the engine doesn't feel very refined over 4-5k rpm..

The looks of the car are definitely a plus, and did influence me considerably against the Mazda 3.

So, overall, not a bad car at all, though there are definitely sportier ones out there at this price range. 

Just be a little wary about the manual transmission, as I had to put up with a car which seems to have been abused by its first owner..
"
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,dewaynej77, 03/12/2011,LOVE IT!,4,"I have had my lancer for 7 months now, and still love it as much as the day I drove it off the lot.
I LOVE the extra's like bluetooth, 6 disc changer, sub woofer, CVT trans, and stering wheel controls.
I get so many compliments on the look of my car.
I hope to keep this car for years.
I haven't had one single problem so far, and I hope it keeps it up.
Some people complain about engine noise, but I like the sound.
I really can't say enough good things about my lancer!!!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,nick93mac, 12/02/2011,Nice Sporty Car,4,"I purchased my Lancer new as a leftover model. I got a great deal, and it has almost all the bells and whistles. This is my first brand new car i have bought, and overall, I am pleased. It has been reliable and the Mitsubishi dealer has great service specials. I had to have the AC blower motor replaced shortly after purchasing, and they were great and hooked me up with a free rental car while it was in the shop. I recommend this car to anyone in the market for a fairly fuel efficient car, that doesn't look like a Prius. One word of advice, get the manual transmission. I wish I did."
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,PS3Fanboy, 03/30/2010,"Fun, quality, reliability and great valu",5,"I bought an auto DE last fall and have been extremely happy with the car. What attracted me was the loads of features for the price, including power everything, 16-inch wheels, 7 airbags (more than cars that cost twice as much), performance reputation, high reliability ranking (backed by long warranty), and high safety ratings from the govt and IIHS. I have not been disappointed at all, in fact everything has exceeded my expectations. I drive the car a lot, 50/50 highway and city, and the fuel economy is excellent (I don't hard accelerate). The styling draws a lot of attention -- which unfortunately got me a speeding ticket! In short, this is a great compact car, best in its class."

Mitsubishi dealer replaced my visors with new ones.  After about 4 weeks, they do the same thing.  I find it hard to drive toward the sun, holding the visor in position with one hand and steering, shifting and using turn signals with the other hand.  Other Mitsubishi models have better visors.  Mitsubishi seems uninterested in fixing this problem on the Lancer."
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,Joe M., 08/26/2009,Economy vs Comfort and Safety,4,"The 2010 lancer rides just like the 08, 09 lancers which are a new generation of lancers. The 2.0 liter dohc, 16 valve engine with innovative timing performs well but the 2.4 performs much better and is only available in the expensive gts, which doesn't have as comfortable a suspension. The cvt transmission is smooth and the car soaks up most bumps. The cheap plastics on the dashboard somehow make you wonder if they cheapened anything else. I've had prior lancers and they were all exceptionally reliable - as good as a Toyota."
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,Juledum, 04/22/2010,Waht a japanese car,4,"I bought a DE MAN and I am very happy with it. The performance is very good and it's fun to drive. I don't feel intimidated when a BMW or other fancy cars stop next to me in a Light. When they want to show the power of their cars, the Lancer response very well with it's 152hp and its light weight. It is a good car for long trips."
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,nkomn, 05/12/2010,lancer,4,"My Lancer ES is a beautiful car, it can use a little more power but is fine for normal driving. I think it should get a little better gas milage than it does."

Although this car may lack the gizmos of some of these cars, I'm still glad I chose it.  Love the exterior styling and peppiness of the car (ES Five Speed).  Bluetooth and Sirius radio make the highway driving more enjoyable.  Handles well on the curves.  Easy and fun shifting.  Good mpg, exactly what I was looking for.  And it was a bit lighter on the wallet too.  Time will tell, but so far, so good.  "
mitsubishi,lancer,2010,Greg, 06/22/2010,Everything you need,4,"You really can't find a better car for the price.  I've seen some complaints about power which confuses me.  I have a 5 speed manual and I have TONS of power.  You just need to learn your car so you know when to shift.  It's also very agile at HIGH speeds and slows down quickly too.  I drive quite a bit finding a car that's comfortable is hard since I'm 6'3"" and 285 lbs.  For me at least it's one of the more comfortable cars in it's class that I've sat in.  I actually like the interior as well.  It's simple.  I don't need a car that'll shave for me while I drive."

I read a lot of reviews about the car being down on power, but I think the cvt transmission is just that smooth that it doesn't feel the way some vehicles feel when you get on the gas, can't even feel it shift sometimes.The car has plenty of power for (normal) driving and not for those looking to go drag racing or something like that. this car was actually built in japan so the quality will be there unlike some vehicle's that have a Japanese but built in some other country. The car is pretty good on gas and if your driving mostly hwy you should see about 33 or 34 mpg hwy. I plan to put in a k&n air filter to get even better mpg."
mitsubishi,lancer,2011,venster, 08/01/2012,Sleeper,4,"CVT takes some time to get used to.
Has its quirks but helps with the mpg.
I bought the car for an economical commuter which it does beautifully.
Averaging 35mpg on my commute-80%highway.
Interior is decent-alot of plastic but mitsubishi pulls it off.
Exterior styling is nice.
Handles well.
It's not a BMW, nor does it cost as much."
mitsubishi,lancer,2011,jacks74, 03/17/2013,Pros and Cons,4,"This was my first brand new car. A couple months into purchasing it, I had an issue starting it. I took it in and they said that it was a computer glitch with my line of car and that they couldn't fix and to press on the gas to start it when it happens. Currently battling the dealership with that but looking at others comments, it seems it'll likely always do this. Other than that I love it. I would be more satisfied if the dealership could fix the starting issue. I wish I would have purchased it used because the used price of the car would definitely be worth it. "
mitsubishi,lancer,2011,Brittany, 12/11/2018,7 years,4,"The 2011 Lancer is the first car I owned and I still have it to this day! Has about 115,000 and has never gave me any major problems (been in 2 car accidents). After reaching 100,000 I noticed I was needing maintenance such as oxygen sensor went out and struts were getting bad but that's it. I drive this car on a daily basis and its great on gas and handles really well on my commute to work. I love this car! It was been good to me and I wish I can keep it forever.  *NOTE the transmission is very different compared to other cars.When friends or family members drive my car they find the transmission odd due to CVT, but that is something I have gotten use to over the years. Also, beware when changing the transmission oil! I had my transmission oil changed at a local mechanic and it started to over heat. I took it to the dealership and the switched it out (cost about 130.00) and everything went back to normal. I highly recommend you have the transmission changed at the dealer or buy he transmission oil from the dealer and change it yourself speaking from experience.

It comes with almost everything you need for the daily commute and has some room for the occasional spirited driving. The limited trunk space gives room for 3 laundry baskets. Rear seat room is decent. Car feels heavier, yet agile and nimble. Responsive engine sounds good, but CVT is loud and leaves you wanting/wishing for more. Acceleration is average. Handling and suspension is above average: light and neutral with quick turn-in. Understeer can be dangerous when entering corners too fast. Fuel economy is average, combined 30mpg +/-2. "

The power steering is making an unpleasant noise now as well. The headliner makes a buzzing noise when the road is smooth, worse when there are bumps in the road.
 We have noticed from A-holes in parking lots that there are no protective side moldings on the doors so we have a couple nasty dings in them now. There is a huge delay when operating the HVAC controls, dangerous when you are trying to clear the fog from the windshield. We have found that there are times when the car turns over but does not start right away, takes a few tries. Our last 2001 Lancer was better imo. "

But I'm sure I drive it harder then most while on the track. The car has good power and handles pretty damn well. I wax my car 2 times a month. Paint might be a bit cheap but just keep it waxed.

The best part is that it was in our driveway when the transmission failed. We had the car towed and brought back to the dealership. Now they want to totally replace the transmission on the brand spanking new car.

mitsubishi,lancer,2011,skater69, 05/24/2012,Rally Red Lancer GTS CVT,4,"CVT takes a little getting used to.
It's much quicker using the paddle shifters or manual mode if you want to jet off the line.

I put a Takeda SRI intake-cheap/easy mod and it wakes it up a little bit/sounds great

The GTS handles extremely well. It really does feel like a sport sedan in the curves and it's fun to use the paddles on the back roads.
Steering is great.
Cruises effortlessly on the freeway at 80+.

Seats are very comfortable.
Interior is nice if not spectacular.

My only gripe with my GTS is I find the gas pedal angle kind of uncomfortable.
It's too short or something.
I got some larger RAZO aftermaket pedals which I'll be installing soon to help alleviate."

It would try and turn over and after about 3 tries, it finally would start..barely. I took it to the dealership and they said they couldn't help since it wouldn't do it while there.

After some 20 years of Mitsu reliability, we figured an 82 year-old woman deserved a new reliable car with a bit of pizazz. Sure, the ES is no barn-burner, but the 16"" alloys handle well around curves, and there's plenty of gadgetry to keep mom busy till the end of her days! While I like the height of the Outlander, the Lancer does inspire more confidence around the corners. Of course fuel economy is a big plus. We we use to 35+ with our old Mirage. The V6 Outlander is lousy for mpg, but the Lancer ES is a champ!"
mitsubishi,lancer,2011,mitsumistake, 04/25/2012,Lancer CVT is really weird,2,"I bought a Lancer SX recently and have clocked 1600km and the CVT has behaved very strangely from day one. It lurches about dramatically especially when cold. Taking foot off accelerator produces sudden jolts, sometimes quite violently, and it then seems to want to brake on its own and slows down rapidly while coasting. Braking often produces a sensation like the car is fighting against the braking and wanting to surge forward. This is the weirdest drive I've ever had and have had no support from Mistubishi - the first 1500km service last week I gave the dealer a very concise report on this problem, and they had the car for TWO DAYS. They said the problem was fixed, but it has not. "

I was worried about the CVT transmission because i read online it was a bad transmission with no power. Wow, these ""expert"" reviewers must be test driving too many turbo mustangs and super cars. The CVT is just fine in power! If you are not used to driving one, it may feel different. So in a with a regular auto transmission, a sign of an underpowered car is when u push the gas hard, you will see the engine RPM go way up but the speed lags until it up-shifts a gear. The CVT sounds just like that so u THINK like it's underpowered but it's not true. Test drive one."

 I am particularly perplexed by their commend regarding the engine/CVT transmission combination, which in reality is smooth, quiet and powerful considering the excellent gas mileage (over 33 on the highway).
You can buy cars with better mpg, but it will come at the expense of power.
I have not problem going up steep hills at speed, with very little noise coming from the engine/transmission."

Gas mileage was better than advertised, rarely got worse than 30 mpg in combined driving and regularly got 36-37 on the highway. I'm 5'11"" and there was plenty of leg room. Good stereo, though nothing special. Didn't have to perform any maintenance on it other than oil changes, which are only needed every 7500 miles. No problems whatsoever. I got hit by someone probably going 40 and I was not hurt, other than my pride. (accident was my fault.) I highly recommend the Lancer to anyone looking for a good, reliable car with great gas mileage. I'm seriously considering buying another Lancer myself.

mitsubishi,lancer,2012,Arsh, 01/19/2018,Value AWD car if you can ignore the faults,4,"This is a great value AWD car if you can look past it's faults. Even with those, I'm saddened by the fact that I won't be able to buy a re-design model as Mitsubishi has decided to cancel the car for now. Pros: would be affordable, AWD, Blutooth works flawless, heated seats with cloth (i hate leather), and great handling. The biggest cons are the fact that while the 2.4L will get you up to speed and stay there easily, it's dull to drive and slow to respond because of it's rubber band effect. The 2.4L with a shiftable auto would have made this car loads of fun. Also the CVT used to be extremely jerky. This was remedied by getting the transmission fluid flushed, but I wish I had known that initially because it was miserable at slow speeds the first few years. Anyone buying used should immediately have the fluid flushed on it. Also road noise is not reduced in the least. All that said though, this thing eats snow for breakfast, handles road trips like a wonder, and is the best value car i've found. It doesn't have everything the big names have, but it's 1000x more fun to drive than most of them.

He told me to buy a Mitsubishi. He said they had stepped up their game on reliability and after owning mine for 3 years now, i couldn't agree more! I owned American cars my whole life and finally after the last one took a dump on me, I quit. I decided to only go foreign from now on. I walked into the mitsubishi dealership, test drove the lancer and bought it the next day and never looked back. In 3 years, I have been in for routine oil changes and 1 little thing that they called me to notify me of and was completely covered by them. The Alternator had a service ticket issue which did make a weird noise for about a month before they called me. Thats all cleared up now. It has started every time. It handles well but feels a little boxy. It is not the most fuel efficient ride in its class, but 30 MPG on average for me isn't bad at all. I wish it had a little more pep to get up to speed and the sound system is lacking but other than that I love it and I do not in anyway regret my decision to buy Mitsubishi. I would recommend it.

mitsubishi,lancer,2015,Car enthusiast, 11/03/2018,You get what you pay for,3,"We wanted a new 4-door sedan with a good warranty and a low price. Found our Lancer at an excellent price due to end-of-year discount. It currently has about 30,000 miles on it, and I would sell it today if I could but we owe more on it than it is worth, since the resale value is very low on these cars and we made the mistake of taking out a fairly long term for our loan. First problem we noticed is that the car's gear ratios seem to be off. It accelerates well in 1st gear, but once you shift into 2nd you lose all your momentum and the car crawls forward until you get into higher RPMs. The car has tan cloth seats that seem to get stained just from you looking at them. We have no kids and aren't slobs, yet somehow the car has stains all over the seats. It has stains just from snow falling on the seat and getting it a little wet. The car is a 2015 but feels like a 2008, Mitsubishi really has done next to nothing to modernize the Lancer since they released this generation. The car does have Bluetooth capability but it takes a long time to connect, and when I try to use the voice prompts to make a call it often can't understand what I am saying, even when I speak slowly and clearly. With about 15,000 miles on it, the car started having problems where it would have to crank for quite a while before starting. Now it has some sort of creaking in the suspension with only 30,000 miles on it. I'm just crossing my fingers at this point and hoping it doesn't need major repairs before we can pay off enough of the loan to justify selling it. This is the second Mitsubishi I've owned and I will never own another one unless I get something like a 3000GT as a project car, knowing I will need to sink lots of money into it.

It’s not the best car I’ve owned, I traded in my sonata which was almost perfect in its design but it was far more expensive.

mitsubishi,lancer,2016,Rob, 07/02/2017,Great Car- Easily Overlooked,4,"Lets be real about this review.  This is a compact AWD car for around $20k.  It is more of an entry level AWD car. But I think it is an all-around, excellent, fun to drive car.  For what you pay and what you get it is an outstanding value.  This car is easily overlooked in favor of other small foreign cars.  So far no mechanical issues  (63,000 miles and was purchased brand new).  I have a 2016 ES, AWD with the 2.4 CVT.  I love the (lack of) technology in the car.  It's simple and in some ways , ""old school"".  Controls are laid out well and easy to use.  Visibility is excellent!!  I never have any issues checking my blind spots or backing the car.  

Engine:  I have the optional 2.4 engine but this comes standard with the AWD system.  Mine is crippled by the CVT transmission.  This engine delivers very nice power (relatively speaking) especially at highway speeds. It was quite peppy and responsive when new but it seems to have quickly lost some of its punch.  Off the line acceleration is not bad from 0-30 mph;  but from 30-60mph, tends to drop off a bit.  I can manage a 0-60 time of about 8 seconds.  It was slightly quicker when new and may have dropped into the mid-7's from time to time.  This is not a race car and you will not win any drag races with it.  However, the engine is adequate for ""normal"" driving under most conditions.  

Fuel Economy:  I personally find the fuel-economy to be very good.  If you put things into perspective and consider the following;  2.4, CVT (automatic) with A/C and AWD. Then I think 30 MPG is outstanding!! If you can manage to drive around the speed limit on the highway I have even managed an occasional 32 MPG from time to time.  I don't know why other reviews on this car suggest fuel-economy is sub-par.    

Transmission: I don't care for the CVT automatic ( but to be fair, it has not given me any issues yet).  I think it holds the engine performance back too much and it never allows the engine to happily-rev to the red line, instead it allows for a leisurely stroll around the tach.  Also, the engine tends to operate in the same range of about 1500-2500 rpm for almost every driving condition.  I find myself forcing higher rpm from the engine, just to get it out of that operating range from time to time.  So I find this to be pretty disappointing.  For lack of better wording, I also find the engine trying to ""lug"" from time to time, especially if climbing a grade at highway speed.  This is among the worst CVT transmissions I have ever used.  It is far from smooth and VERY slow to respond to throttle changes.  Mine does tend to ""jerk"" from time to time, and has no problems letting you know it's unrefined.  

For the AWD system:  This car is AWD, ...NOT...  4wheel Drive.  Yes, there is a difference! During my snow testing of the car I used the ""4wheel Lock"" feature and de-activated the traction control system.  I feel this allowed the AWD system to have as much power as possible for the tests I performed with the car.  Other settings are available and many of you may prefer to leave the traction control system on during snow driving conditions.  
I finally had the opportunity to drive the car in some snow conditions.  (keep in mind that tires play a significant role in this area).  My tires are 205-60-16  vehicle.    I have replaced the original Yokohama tires with Continentials (and the Continential tires performed much worse than the OE-Yokohama's).  Most of the snow I drove in was approx 4""-6"" as we simply don't get the amount of snow we used to in my area.  I found the car to spin quite a bit, in anything more than 4"" especially when getting started from a stop (even more so on a grade)and even easing on the throttle.  (but... I did deliberately stop on a snow covered grade a couple of times in an attempt to get the car stuck, but with some wheel spin and good use of the throttle I was on my
 way)   I did have the opportunity to drive the car in some deeper snow (say between 6""-8"")  on a couple of secondary roads during the past winter.  The car performed well but there is room for improvement.  Again, I did notice a bit of wheel spin from the rear wheels under the worst conditions.  This is more than I would like for an AWD car.  It slips and spins, especially  in deeper snow but it did NOT get stuck.  It seems capable and got the job done.  I'm not sure I would take this car off road, and the owners manual does not recommend it either.  So better stick to roads on the map, just to be safe.    

Overall:   I'm very pleased with the car. I purchased mine brand new and so far no serious problems. It fits my budget, seems reliable and meets my needs. I am heart-broken to find that Mitsubishi no longer offers the car in it's lineup.

Update January 2020 - No significant changes. No significant problems; I stand by my previous reports on the car. Current mileage is approximately 75,000

mitsubishi,lancer,2016,Colt A., 09/20/2016,I love my lancer!,5,"This is the third Mitsubishi I have owned and it has been great, and the dealership I bought it from was also excellent. I got it for $14,000 brand new, have had no issues like all of my other mitsu's. Its disparaging see such poor reviews on vehicles like this that are clearly superior to thier american counterparts, like the dart, cruise or focus, that all blow up or the infotatinment system needs to constantly be messed with, or push button start going out at 20,000 miles or trannies going out @ 50,000 miles. Enjoy your fords that will rust out in ten months [non-permissible content removed].

mitsubishi,lancer,2016,Allen, 09/12/2016,Big Mistake,2,"I was excited to purchase the Lancer because it offered a sporty styling with AWC at a reasonable price. After owning a 2016 Lancer SEL for a little over a month I hate the car. Driver ergonomics are deplorable: - Leather seats that are uncomfortable (I feel like I've been sitting on a metal folding chair after a 20-30 minute drive. Lower back support and seating side support is almost non-existent. - A dead pedal foot rest gives no room to stretch out my left leg. The only way to extend my left leg is to put my foot under the brake pedal - not a safe thing to do - or keep my leg bent in a very unnatural position. The alternative is to move the seat back which then leads to over extending to reach the steering wheel. - Move the seat forward, and the center console arm rest no longer exists. - Without a telescoping steering wheel, arms must be almost straight to reach the wheel. (Note: I am an average size, 5'9"" male driver) - The clock is so tiny and so far away from the driver, it can barely be seen. Put on polarized sunglasses and the display screen for the clock, back-up camera, and entertainment system become almost impossible to see in daylight. - Move the tilt steering wheel down, and it covers a good part of the speedometer. - A tiny collection of icons between the tach and speedometer are busy and difficult to decipher at a quick glance. The fact that the outside temperature is part of this tiny display clutters the display and is not convenient for any passengers to view. - The self-dimming mirror is a joke. Street lights ""trick"" the sensors into thinking it's daylight and the result is blinding glare from the rear view mirror. - The sunvisors are extremely flimsy. They seem to be nothing more that plastic covered card board. And there is no extender on the flimsy visors for when the sun hits at just that annoying ""over the shoulder"" angle through the side window. - Significant lack of storage space and small cup holders are major inconveniences. - Leather seats and steering wheel are made of a rough texture leather - not supple or smooth. - At highway speeds, road noise is quite loud. - Headlights also seem dim compared to my previous two cars. Added to these horrible ergonomics, my car features a ""thump"" in the trunk when going over some bumps. The car was ""delivered"" with 17 miles on the odometer - dirty on the inside and outside, including pine sap blobs that ate through the clear coat. The dealer's fix was to have the finish ""wet sanded"". After 3 weeks I had a loud thumping in the driver's side rear quarter panel. Had to schedule an appointment with service department. The back-up sensor was banging around inside. They ""fixed"" it with double-sided tape. Only one ""outlet"" in the entire car; no usb port. Radio/entertainment center sounds very tinny and cheap. And the horn sounds like something that comes from a child's tricycle.
 I am SO sorry that I purchased this vehicle.

mitsubishi,lancer,2017,Justin Greer, 10/03/2017,So far I am happy with the purchase,4,"I picked a black pearl sedan right off the semi truck's trailer. The first thing you may notice is the seats. Mitsubishi did nothing to the comfort of their seats on this one. I would not say they are uncomfortable, but it is something that you get used to. My biggest grip about this car (any other mitsubishi's) is the paint durability. I have a 2011 lancer as well and the paint just chips so easy from road debris. I recommend getting a touch up pen in your purchase. The car runs great (just as my 2011 with CVT) but mine is a 5 speed and the shifting sync must be out our not broken in yet. Shifting into gear sometimes can be sticky and be jammed completely.  I will be making an appointment to see if the dealer can have a look just to be sure. Overall, I am happy with the car. I got a great deal on it and the manufacture warranty is crazy good.

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,BigTim, 05/26/2006,Modern Muscle!,4,"I have owned NUMEROUS cars, a'96 BMW M3, a '94 Mazda RX7, a Mini Cooper S, a Volvo 850R, an Audi S4, all of which were extensively modified... This car is by far the most honed instrument that I have ever owned. The only car which was even close to as fun was the Mini. This car is a beast in every way, I am Currently running over 400 hp, have had numerous encounters with the drag strip, and 35,000 miles on the still strong stock clutch. I have had some auto-X and the brakes are still strong and have lots of life left. I ask a lot from my cars and this has been one of the best, most reliable, and wicked cars I have ever owned. It is not for every one, just a select few who put driving above all else."

Eclipse GST (stock 4G63 engine and 
turbo). Now that I have a wife and 5 
year old twins, I need something 
larger. My wife wanted my to get a 
Lexus IS300.  I wanted a EVO.  Once I 
got my wife to test drive the EVO, she 
was sold.  Also, she doesn't mind the 
looks and comments she get from passer-
byes. This is by far one the most fun 
cars I have driven.  It is an absolute 
pleasure to drive... power, handling, 
brakes and exceptional feel.  I will 
continue to use my '95 Eclipe to 
commute to work, and see how many miles 
it will go. The EVO will drug of choice 
for the weekends... putting a smile on 
face each time I drive it."

car is, and yes the car is fast. The
seats are comfortable at first, but
after 3 hours it gets to be a little
sore. Steering is very quick to respond,
you sneeze and the car moves. The stiff
suspension makes the car very agile. "

cost ratio there is no other car like 
the Evo except the STi, which is a few 
thousand more. Everything you have read 
about this car is true. It's true that 
all of the cost of the vehicle is spent 
on performance and not luxury, but then 
ask yourself why you buying a sports car

straight line, but throw in some 
curves and GOODBYE!  I considered the 
Subaru WRX STI due to similiar 
performance, but the ""Corolla with an 
air scoop"" uncool styling turned me 
away.

The Evo is a true production race 
car.  I owned a Mustang GT years ago 
that was fast in a straight line, but 
that is all the former pony cars 
brought to the table.  The Evo brings 
the whole performance driving package

ALL-WHEEL DRIVE!)"

JDM power levels.  A simple reflash 
will fix that too!  The STI is a great 
car...but!, does not even come close to 
the toughness of the 4g63 engine.  The 
car handles astoundingly!  The STI 
really does not compare in that 
department.  Who cares about 1/4 mile 
times...how often do you drag a 1/4 on 
the street from stop light to stop 
light.....never!  The 0-60 time is 
where it is at(more of a real world 
time)and with the evo the time is 
awesome, 1 shift and you're there.  
Whereas the sub-a-who needs 2 to get 
there....what a marketing tactic the 6 
speed was.  The DCCD is not needed...by 
any means!  "

easily that it begs you for more.  And 
just if I ever think about getting used

under the hood that can be tapped for 
outrageous power gains.  I love how the

comfort level is above average,

a very quick car, and will shock most

hurt that theyve made & raced 7 prior 
versions of the car before designing 
the Evo8.   Unlike the cars that I used 
to modify in my street racing years, 
the Evo8 is well balanced blend of 
incredible performance and effortless 
handling.  The cars handling is so 
quick and responsive, it often feels as 
though all I need to do is think about 
making a lane change and the Evo8 does 
the rest by itself."

The EVO on the other hand is all about 
performance!  If you're seeking for a 
performance car and is willing to give 
up some comfort and give up creature 
comfort amenities the EVO is it!  
People complain about gas mileage... 
well, it's right on the window sticker

didnt buy it for that. Serious 
acceleration at nearly any RPM, eyeball

It gets regular servicing, and it never argues. This car hasn't let me down yet. I went to the Sierra Nevadas during the last BAD winter, didn't even need chains w/the tires that I had. I would recommend this car to anyone, and anyone that badmouths this car, either doesn't know how to drive it, or is too stupid to appreciate all that it offers, space, speed, comfort."

wonderful.  The wife hates it she says 
the seats are uncomfortable, steering 
is to sensitive, ride is to rough, 
styling is to over the top, and it is 
to fast.  This is a drivers car, not a 
pretender if you are looking to be 
pampered look elsewhere.  If you are 
looking for no holds bared preformance 
your car is ready and you don't have to

other compromises in their proper 
place - far in the background!  
Magazine reviews said the interior was 
cheap looking, but I don't find 
anything wrong with it.  I'll call 
it ""spartan"". The Evo web boards are 
rife with reports of bad clutches, 
fragile paint, and warped rotors - I've 
experienced none of that - in 140 miles 
of driving.
The ride can be jittery on bad roads, 
but such is the price of performance 
suspensions. The OEM tires are 
dangerous in snow, so dedicated snow 
tires are a must."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,teo2734, 01/04/2004,My Evo,5,"I picked a Rally Red. I test drove an 
STi just to feel the difference between 
two. Evo outran STi on all aspects. STi 
felt like a regular sedan vs Evo felt 
like a true Rally Race Car. Of course 
U.S. version STi is not the true WRC 
car because engine is too big (2.5 
liters, WRC regulates the engine size 
to 2.0 liters such as Evo's 
engine).Well so far I have 1900 miles 
on my Evo and I enjoyed evry one of 
those miles with great fun. No m,atter

outstanding.  Put them together on an 
empty winding road and it is an

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,EJEvo8, 12/11/2005,"Some good, some not so good",3,"The 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is a great performer for the dollar.  But what has been invested in the drivetrain appears to have been taken away from the interior design.  The interior is spartan at best, but anything performance related has been well taken care of.  The Momo steering wheel and Recaro bucket seats are in sharp contrast to the very cheap, easily scratched plastics that make up the interior trim.  The drivetrain is wonderous, a lot of power is on tap, but the factory paint job suffers from orange peel, and the clear coat easily scratches.  Focus on the performance and you'll be grinning.  Attempt to take a relaxing cruise and you'll be gritting your teeth.  The suspension is brutally stiff, and yet there is some body lean."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,Russell, 01/07/2006,Still in Love,4,"I drive 60 miles round trip to work every day, plus regular family trips and ""fun"" trips. The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is great. With winter tires it is very sure footed for New England winters. With the OEM tires (now worn) the car corners like a dream. The car is just at 21,000 miles and so far I have no problems with it. All the other owners I speak to, confirm that they are exceptionally happy with their choice too. Do not buy the car expecting a high comfort ride, the seats are great but in the end this is a very, very firm rally car."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,WRC4ME, 02/16/2004,EVO VIII,4,"This is not a car for just anyone.  
You must appreciate performance over

built, known in the Rally World as one 
of the most reliable cars in racing.  
Just remember to calculate your 
insurance cost involved before your

had to sell it.  I never thought that I 
would find a replacement for it, untill 
I bought my EVO.  It is a fun car that 
handles great winding backroads, fats

entertaining to see a person's reaction 
when they see what the EVO can do."

It can roll with the  Camaros and Mustangs of the world, while you throw your family in the back seat.  It has more than enough room in the trunk for whatever you need and the power to get you anywhere you need to go.  Without a doubt, this is one of, if not the best car in its class."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,Great Car!, 04/25/2006,You never find a car more fun to drive!,4,"All I can say is ""Wow"".  I thought Mustangs, Corvettes, and other muscle cars were fun to drive but once I got a hold of my new Lancer EVO, I'll never own another muscle car again.  Everything about the performance of this car is exciting whether you're turning a corner or flooring the gas.  It almost feels like your driving a go-cart and can do anything you want with it.  If you are someone who's into owning something fun to take out each day, the EVO is for you!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,bzadboy, 03/15/2004,Evolved!,4,"A true 4-dr sprts sedan for less than 
$30,000. Unbelievably fun to drive. If 
you thought a WRX was fun, wait until 
you drive this one. Cornering is 
phenomenal, no body roll and the 
steering gives you an 'in control' 
feel at all times. Acceleration is 
excellent, the car will push you back 
into your Recaro seat and hold you 
there as you wind up the speedometer.

had a few discrepencies due to a poor

i have done a few modifications to the 
car, and each one has really brought

use my EVO as a daily driver so I've 
had the opportunity to get a feel for 
the car. The handling, steering, and 
control of this car is amazing. On wet 
or dry pavement, this thing handles 
like a dream. Snow is a different 
story since the car is stocked with hi-
performance tires. The engine is so 
zippy. This car hauls like a bullet. 
After I bought this car, I read every 
article/review from every major car 
mag. Not one author gave a negative 
review and that says a lot about this 
car. Other than the WRX, there are no

this thing. "

nothing, be prepared to pay for all the 
speeding tickets you're gonna get.  If 
you need comfy pleather seats for your

need cruise control, your left leg is 
weak, and your right foot is soft -

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,NoVetteinOK, 05/11/2004,Caution!,4,"The Evo is by far one of the funest 
cars to drive on the market.  It's 
much more functional than a Z06 or a 
M3 as a daily driver (Due to 4 doors, 
plenty of space, and good gas 
mileage); however, the car will 
experience alot wear and tear.  

Average drivers find the clutch will 
not last more than 20000 miles.  The 
warranty on the clutch is only 12000 
miles. 

The car is not optimized for 91-92 
octane gasoline.  The owners manual 
suggests using 98.

The tires will not last longer than 
20000 miles.  The Yokohamas provide 
excellent grip on dry surfaces, but 
not in the snow.

The bottom line: this fast car with 
incredible tuning potential.  "

SERIOUS CONTENDER IN ANY COMPETITION.  
NOT MEANT FOR DRAG RACING, BUT AN 
EXCELLENT ALL ROAD KILLER.
  NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS.  THE CLUTCH IS 
CRAP.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR; ADJUST THE 
CLUTCH PEDAL AS SOON AS YOU GET IT.  
THE TIRES WILL WEAR OUT IF DRIVEN

one. It only requires a down shift and 
I'm in the turbo zone running down 
almost anything on the road. I love the 
looks on my friends faces when we take

exhilirating, you could do circles 
around M3's with this car, destroy 
corvettes, I mean... its mind boggling 
to refer to this engine as

The fact that it can take 4 tall adults 
in total comfort (at least in terms of

passed up Boxter S, 911, new M3 and 
even Ferrari products in favor of the

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2003,Jay, 03/24/2019,"Seventeen years and 200,000 miles later",5,"I am the original owner of a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII. I have taken the car countless times to the drag strip, track day events, and numerous automotive events and it has never failed. It currently has over 400hp at the crank with the original engine, transmission, transfer case, differentials and original turbo. Change engine and drivetrain oil, timing belt and water pump at factory intervals and the Evo will be fine. I check spark plugs frequently for ware however changes should be made between 3000-7000 miles. Interior has held up exceptionally well. I hear reviews of those disappointed with interior materials, however, in the long run the materials have stood the test of time. Recaro front seats are a great balance between track and street. I am 5'7"" and my back is supported and I have no aches after long drives. Rear seats are good. There is ample leg room and comfort is good. The only components I have needed to replace are as follows: alternator (at 155,000 miles) compressor fan (broken fan blade from ice at 190,000 miles) and starter motor (at 194,000 miles.) Check the driver side floor fuse box for signs of corrosion or water. There is a rubber plug on the firewall which can come loose allowing water on the fuse box. This is an easy fix. Simply glue the plug shut. This occurred to me 12 years ago and we sealed the pug at the dealer... problem solved. Many Evos unfortunately have been abused and this is where you will hear reliability issues. If you are on the market take care in finding a well maintained model. Best gas mileage I received on the highway was 27mpg on a trip from Atlanta to Philadelphia. The 4G63 engine has a long history stretching back to the Group B Rally Car the Mitsubishi Starion and it's nice to know the engine has constantly been refined over the years. I have driven BMW M3s, Corvettes, 911 Turbos and 911 GT3s, and the Evo is a great value for performance and long term reliability. And after seventeen years and 200,000 miles I will probably hang on to the Evo for an indefinite amount of time.

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2004,John I., 11/19/2006,Gone in 4.4 Seconds,4,"The Lancer Evo RS is a practical four-door sedan.  It is not a boring four-door sedan.  I wasn't expecting boredom, but I am continually amazed at how much fun the RS is to drive.  If I pick the right gear, response is great.  Its handling is beyond belief, especially on wet roads.  I replaced the Yoko Advans with Eagle F1 GS-D3's at 22,000 miles.  Turn-in isn't quite as sharp, but the Evo is now a little less frantic and somewhat more relaxed, with outstanding handling. The RS did not have a radio.  I installed an Alpine CD player and rear speakers only.  I've owned a series of MR 2's, a 1LE Z28 and an LT4 Corvette.  They were all great cars, but the Evo is a step above."

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2004,Brandon, 02/19/2006,Fun to drive and great deal,4,"The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is great car in all aspects. It's a quick car with a great suspension.  It's a great car for the track. It's lots of fun to drive on the highway, canyon, or the track.  It is not the greatest every day car and the exterior looks make everyone think your on your way to see the next ""Fast and Furious"" movie.  The interior is basic and simple, but great for the track.  Its suspension does a great job in the canyons and tracks, but provides a VERY bumpy ride on anything but smooth and new road.  Its steering is quick, which is great for salom or the track but on the highway can get you into some trouble.  If you're not paying attention, you can end up in the next lane. Its acceleration is very quick and you hit top speed of 149 in less than a minute, at the track of course."

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2004,2004EVORS, 07/26/2004,MY EVO THOUGHTS,4,"Love the nimble quality of the ride. 
Very responsive it can take off 
regular and jet out ahead of a torquey 
automatic. People do not think this 
car is fast so it is a sleeper. You 
will get respect when you shift gears. 
The best thing about it is the low eng 
torque that is very uncommon in a 4 
banger of 2.0 liters. You hit 273lbs @ 
3500 so you can shift at that 
comfortably. Avg 19 mpg is decent for 
the performance you get. Can stay in 
5th gear on the freeway, no need to 
shift, really!  Limited 
availability can cause problems.

Nice Recaro seats, momo steering wheel. I like the simple interior. Super fun to drive in city, although highway ride is a little rough and noisy, that's the only draw back. After market mods suggested: turbo timer, boost control, cold air intake, turbo back exhaust, HKS intercooler, blowoff valve, racing clutch (optional). The AWD system is amazing in this car.

drove a lot of freeway a 6th gear would 
help. This is a performance car that 
doesn't make compromises.  "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2004,Nelvitt, 02/19/2005,Evo Rocks,4,"This is a fast, great handling car.  It is not a Cadillac, it doesn't have a lot of toys, but bang for the buck it can't be beat."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2004,Joe, 02/24/2005,Great all around package!,4,"I thought I would be buying a BMW 330i when I could for the last three years. It came time and I looked at the 330i, G35, TL, STi and Evo. I only started looking over the Evo a few months ago. I always liked the WRX and thought it would be great own as well. After months of research, driving cars, etc. I went with a 04 Evo VIII w/SSL. I know without a doubt I made the right choice. This car is simply amazing! If you are unsure at least test drive one. I have never known a car to perform so well and to feel so confident doing so. Plus, you can take three other people with you. I would take a firm ride over a fancy clock any day..."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Jerry Smith, 06/03/2006,EVO 8,5,"Overall the car is a excellent buy. I have no problems with the car. It has outstanding handeling in all weather and traffic conditions that are present in the Houston area. This is not a young person's car, it requires concentration and skill, when you make demands from the car it responds instantly. It takes some getting use to at first, then traffic or open road driving is no problem. I am considering buying my wife a Evo 10 as soon as they hit the dealers."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Tim, 03/15/2006,This car has everything,4,"This is the ultimate car.  It is VERY fast, and handles like you're bolted to the road.  The seats hold you tight when taking the corners, and the Infinity stereo in it is phenominal for a factory system (optional Sun, Sound and Leather package - highly recommended).   However, it also has mounting brackets for my son's car seat, and the trunk is big enough so I can easily fit a few sets of golf clubs.  We have nasty winters, but with the AWD and a set of Blizzaks, this is the best winter car I've ever had (better than my wife's 4WD SUV).  Considering the performance the gas milage is outstanding.  I was looking for a daily driver that had everything, and this is it."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Timmy, 11/30/2008,Awesome - but you'll pay to play,4,"I've had my Evo VIII for 3 years now, and it's an awesome car.  Great power, handling, and braking.  The Recaro seats are awesome; plenty of room/trunk space.  The AWD is wonderful - especially for winter driving (but you need snow tires).   Downside is, everything about this car is expensive.  Premium gas only, and unless you drive like an old man, you'll rarely get more than maybe 20- 21 mpg.  Takes only synthetic motor oil.  OEM Brembo brake pads cost over $300 per side, and keep up with pads because replacing rotors will cost you over a grand per side.  OEM tires last about 10K miles, and cost over $300 per tire.   That's just the wearables - replacing components costs more."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Ozzman, 10/11/2005,What a car!,4,"The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution RS model is for those strong enough to handle it.  Ok, that might be a little dramatic, but when you're behind the wheel of this beast you feel as though nothing else can compare.  Your freeway cockiness sky-rockets as you start to toy with Mustang GT's, GTO's, Camaro's, or any others who ""claim"" to have power.  Timid youths soon become aggresive bullies of the road.  And then, then you add your air intake, downpipe, turbo manifold, exhaust, boost controller, and fuel injectors.  Now, this is when modesty sets in.  Modesty because you no longer feel like anything else compares, you now know that nothing else compares. With $2,000 you'll be eating Cobra's and Corvette's for breakfast."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Tim, 05/25/2010,After 5 years as a daily driver,4,"I am the same ""Tim"" who wrote a review on 3/15/2006, and I just sold the car.  It was a great car to have for 5 years, and it certainly is fast and fun, but the quality and reliability of the car was definitely lacking.  I had the AWD pump die 3 times, random sensors blew, and the car developed rattles all the time that needed to be fixed.  Not to mention, the car was kept clean and waxed every few months, but the paint developed rust in 5 areas after 4 years.  My wife's SUV is 8 years old, gets waxed probably once a year, and has no rust. Also, very expensive to maintain so know that going in or you're going to have significant sticker shock when you bring it in for service. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Chris Denning, 12/02/2004,Evo,4,"The Evo is one hell of a ride! Its ride is a bit uncomfortable and there is a bit of road noise but it's always fun to hear the engine roar. It has easily beaten my former Subaru STI sedan and now I can't find a car to match the Evo. The only ones I can think of are a BMW or a Mercedes or a Lotus which all cost about 30,000 more than this little baby. It's four cylinders provide the kind of power I would compare to a V8. Overall it's awesome. This little Evo is going to be my baby for a real long time"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,EVO Driver , 12/04/2004,EVO Driver,1,A good for the price vs performance.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,mythreesons, 12/04/2004,Bang 4 the $$$,4,"Bought the car not knowing much about it, my 16yr old raved about it so I bought it. I don't regret it. Nothing you can't pass on any road, more looks & compliments than my friends C4 turbo rag top, handles like a slot car and very much Harleyesque in that there are more websites for after market goodies to really personalize it (Examples: Carbon fiber, gauges, pods, exhaust, tricks etc.)The orginal quality build is very good, but its fun making it better. The engine is bullit proof, the transmission is good but can use improvement (stronger clutch). I think it a much better looker than the STI & much rarer to find on the street. Finally my dealer support is second to none."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Bob S, 12/04/2004,EVO the new sheriff in town,5,"This car rocks!I owned a 1999 Dodge Viper -- very fast,but this little 4dr with just a little tweaking will give any muscle car a run for its money,including the one I love to wax, the Porsche 911. Ad you pay, what, $90,000 for that?!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,ssupra96, 01/09/2005,2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Clutch problems,4,"My 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution runs great, even better on curvy roads. This is truly a comfortable performance ride. I have leather interior racing seats. They really do make a difference in the look of the vehicle. If the back end gets loose trust the limited slip and the four wheel drive to take you through a turn. In plain english, its fun."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,GTKage, 01/28/2005,2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII,4,My 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII is a very fun car to drive.  It is always comfortable and can be driven fast very easly in straight line or in turns.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Arizona MR, 02/11/2005,What a Blast!,4,"I have had the Evo MR for a month and have put 1,000 miles on it, and I can tell you that you have to drive this car to believe it. I took it up to the mountains last weekend, and hit the curves hard. Thrilling is all I can say.  I have driven some fast cars in my time, but this is the best mix of speed and handling that I have ever experienced. It also snowed six inches and I got to switch the all wheel drive center differential to the snow setting and the car performed beautifully. What was interesting is that I drove very hard on the way up and used a tank and a quarter of gas, but on the way down I drove conservatively and used less than a half tank! That turbo burns the gas! Great Car!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,wingnut17, 02/14/2005,Amazing Machine,5,The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII MR is a complete machine. It is everything any driver ever wanted in a vehicle.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Corty Mk III, 02/17/2005,Car you gotta have.,5,"This car is something that a car enthusiast should consider having. Powerful, fun to drive and very reliable-as long as you do not abuse it. I have put about 25,000 miles as to date and this car still drives the same since I got it from the dealer. Actually it seems to drive smoother as time goes by. Again, I dont abuse this car. I occassionally do power spurts. Zip here zip there. I still have the original tires on, which are very grippy in dry and still grips very good in heavy rain. The car sticks to the road which most cars could not do going around a clover leaf at about 50 mph!Owning this car is a chance of a lifetime for somebody like me!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,silver03evo, 02/26/2005,Lancer Evolution,5,"I wanted one for a long time and had heard nothing but good things about the car. When I was finally able to get one, I found out it was everything everyone had said it was. The car is the most fun car to drive I have ever driven."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,maikong, 02/27/2005,Evolution is Awesome,5,This car is amazing.  If you want a fun car to drive that can dust almost anything on the road this is it. By far the best car on the market today.  Picked over a Suburau WRX STi and I am very happy I did.  The handling on this car is amazing.  Nothing compares to the way this car drives.  It is a rally car legal for the street.  I picked the VIII instead of the MR becuase for 4 or 5 thousand more dollars the MR is just not worth it.  I have a smile on my face everytime I drive my EVO.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,vassago, 02/27/2005,EVO 8,5,"This is the best production car out for a reasonable price.  I test drove both the EVO 8 and the WRX STi, and the Evolution has less power and torque (276hp/286ft-lb. vs 300hp/300ft-lb), but a much better better suspension (much stiffer for better performance), a more advanced AWD system, and the Recaro seats in the EVO hug you, unlike the STi seats which were designed for fat Americans and provide no support.  I have not been beat in a race yet and it is the funnest daily driver I've had the pleasure of riding in, let alone owning."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Mike Valentin, 03/30/2005,Evo VIII - It GOES!,5,"Got my '05 Evo, and boy am I glad! I've had it now for 4 months. It starts beautifully, looks great and performs like a supercar (Too bad that Mitsubishi is not doing well). The acceleration is slow at 2k/rpm, then at 3k/rpm the turbo cooks and there is an incredible surge of power, which is manageable and easily modulated. When all else fails the Brembo brakes are there to slow you down, in combination with the ABS, in a quick way. The transmission ""snicks"" its way through the gates; the engine urges you on; the brakes back you up; the chassis is stiff and inspires confidence--more technical features that work together wonderfully."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,J.D., 05/12/2005,A must drive!!,4,"I paid MSRP+ fees, and it was worth it. I had to go 4 states away to pick it up because there is none of these cars available (MR, charcoal grey). The ride is rough, but I expected that. If you want a smooth and refined performance car, plan to spend over $100,000. This car will eat up anything on the road and still leave you with a 4-door practical car, and money in your pocket. If you want leather, fancy cup holders and a satellite navigation, go somewhere else. This car is raw performance, recognized by those in the know as a car to respect and fear off the start line or on the back streets. I am a huge fan!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Darryl Dowe, 05/17/2005,Evolution:n ot a car...it's an experience,4,"For the automotive enthusiast, the Lancer Evolution 8 is not just a car, it's an experience.  The ultimate expression of the passion and pleasure of driving can be found in one, 4-door sedan sold by Mitsubishi Motors and that vehicle is the Evo.  The Evo is the vehicle other vehicles would want to be if they had a hand in their design.  It's truly an amazing machine for those who can appreciate it's nuances...definately not a machine for the timid.  Get in it and DRIVE!!!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Visco, 07/07/2005,Exotic performance at a fractional price,4,"Hands down the best blend of power,handling and utility for the serious driving enthusiast.  A precision machine that is far more forgiving to drivers than should be expected. 2005 model is underrated from the factory and power output is in the 300hp and 315 ft/lbs. at the crank range based on 4WD dyno results on stock '05 models.  Only true competetor at this price point is the STI, of which every magazine that has done a comparison since '03 has choosen the Evolution as the preferred car.  "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Norio Kushi, 09/26/2005,The Best Stock Sport Sedan Available,4,"This is one sport sedan which does not compromise it's performance in any area in an attempt to appeal to average Joe.  This is one sport sedan which will be forever appreciated by those who know HOW to drive and LOVE to drive.  Forget those reviews which say this is not for long distance, I drive regularly between my two homes in NC and MA and this is definitely my vehicle of choice.  If you like to be isolated from the road, talk on your cell phone while you drive and have more attention on getting to your destination than having fun getting there, this is not the car for you.  No automatics available here. (I also drive an 18 wheeler and own a Honda Civic and Odyssey)."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Chick 'N Evo, 12/15/2005,2005 better than 2003!,4,"We purchased a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VIII in March 2004 and decided to trade it in for a more ""practical"" daily driver 8 months later: an Acura RSX-S.  Though the Acura is an all around great car, we missed the turbo charged, AWD Evo and went back to it.   The overall purchasing process was not bad.  We purchased from the same sales rep, and dealership both times.  The Mitsubishi ""special financing"" was a joke!  Buyer beware: purchasing an Evo includes Yokohama tires that are not winter-friendly.  The odd tire size puts snow tires anywhere from $150 - $200 each.  Overall this is a GREAT CAR - even as a ""family sedan.""  We couldn't be happier the second time around :).  It's comfortable for business or family, fast, and handles like a brick."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Organicwheels, 02/01/2006,A True Driver's Car,4,"If driving is just a necessary part of your day to get from point A to point B and you would rather spend the time talking on your cell phone, then this is not the car for you.  But for us serious enthusiasts who LOVE to drive and KNOW how to drive, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII may be the best car on the planet, at any price!  I drive an 18 wheeler all over the country, but when I'm in my own private vehicle, this is definitely my  vehicle of choice."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Ryan, 03/08/2006,Whats not to like?,4,"The Lancer Evolution is a blast to own, It has excellent acceleration, steering, and braking.  Its maintenance costs are higher than an economy vehicle's but no higher than any other performance wehicle."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Johnny Thor, 04/06/2006,Disappointed,3,"I thought this car was amazing, but it has a ton of turbo lag.  It handles like charm in the twisties, but in a straight line, it falls on its face at the top end.  I have been seen Cobra, STi, Camaro SS, and even lowly SRT-4 models that are faster.  Don't get me wrong this car is awesome for what it made for---rally; it turns like it's on rails."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,steve, 06/01/2006,Evo after 18 months,4,"I love this car.  Thanks to Mitsubishi for building such a fun, focused affordable car!  I replaced the Yoko. tires with an all season radials.  The road noise and all weater traction advantage was worth the slight decrease in steering feel.  The car seems to have gotten faster and just a bit louder after a few thousand miles.  I runs very hard. I have changed the oil, aligned the wheels, replaced the tires (due to road noise), and changed the oil.  It has never been back to the dealer for anything! Overall this car is an intoxicating blend of performance and reliablity at a reasonable price.  "

twin turbos kick in - it has a 
wonderful ""kick in the pants"" that

this is definitely not for you, same 
thing goes with comfort and quietness--
 go to a Lexus or an Acura dealership 
but for performance or fun to drive 
this is defintitely a must have. It's 
like purchasig a Porsche for under 
$35,000; raw brute power which is way 
forgiving on the previous version and 
so I read. The engine sound mixed with 
its high turbo notes get the feeling 
that you own the road, I live in Ohio 
where there's a vast space and less 
traffic so pretty much I can always 
test this car assuming I always get 
lucky with the cops hoping not to 
catch me. No leathers and advanced 
gadgets. Anyways, test drive one and 
you'll see what I mean"

turbotime it myself everytime I stop 
because I don't want to get out of 
it.  The handling is unbelievable; you 
really have to try, to lose control of 
this vehicle.  The driver controlled 
center diff is a great improvement.  
For a turbo car, the power delivery is 
surprisingly linear.  Besides the 
spoiler, the car is subtle for a fast 
sports car.  This car is not overly 
torquey, so it's not bad for driving 
around the family either.  Too bad it 
doesn't get better gas mileage...you 
can literally hear the turbo most of 
the time..just imagining all the gas 
getting burned with that air.  "

live up to the hype. It is a great car 
and the performance is amazing. The 
upgraded bilstien suspension is worth 
the price difference alone.  If you can 
get one at or around MSRP, you'd be 
foolish not to drive on and compare it 
to the regular GSR. The 6speed is silky 
smooth and a joy to row."

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Molly, 02/19/2005,The Evolution Rules the Road,4,"The Evolution will take you to dimensions on the road that you have never experienced in a sudan before. This car will  make you feel like you are flying high on Earth. It is fast off the start and going up a mountain is a breeze. Not only does it hold the road like a sports car but it will stop on a dime. I have two Evolutions, the MR and the VII, and believe me, I LOVE MY CARS!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Mark C., 02/23/2005,A Great Performer,4,"Having owned this car for 5 months, I can't say nothing but good things about the Evo MR. If you're looking for exceptional handling and amazing power, this is the car for you. Being an Edition, this car is a must have for hardcore Evo fans or those looking for a collector's car. I also recommend this car to people who want a fast car who are not interested in tuning it with aftermarket parts and are afraid of losing their warranty. Like I said, the Evo MR is a perfect balance of power and handling, and is very fun to drive. I honestly cannot stop grinning once I get to 6th gear."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Nelvitt, 03/16/2005,Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Rocks,5,This car rocks.  It delivers the performance of cars that cost two and three times as much.  Its handling is unbelieveable.  It is like it is glued to the road.  This is a great car.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Larry Landry, 04/01/2005,Most Bang For Your Buck,4,"When researching for a top perfoming & fun to drive car in the $30,000 range there is a lot to choose from. If you require 4 doors and for the car to practical it cut your choices in half. When they annouced the Evolution was coming I bought every magazine  ith a right up on it. It everything they said it was, its the most fun to drive car I've ever driven, not to mention you can leave all the choices of cars behind you wether in the curvy stuff, or straight line. Besides the Subaru which is a direct competitor there wasn't any other choice for me. Subaru was just missing something. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Emily, 06/07/2005,There's no car I would rather own...,5,"Just try to get me out of my Evo. Living in Detroit, I have gotten into many ""dream cars,"" such as the Viper, the Ford GT and others. Yet there is no car I would rather own than the Evo, even if price were not an option. Yes, it is a bit harsh (the MR is a softer ride, thanks to those Bilsteins), but I like knowing exactly what's going on with the car and the road. You adjust to the rough ride quickly and there is no other downside to this car. The seats are heaven and the set up of the car makes you forget that you don't have cruise on long trips. Superior handling, breaking & power make this car the envy of all who see it move. I am a (female) Evo owner for life. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,fitty, 08/09/2005,most fun car to drive period.,4,I sold my 2005 Pontiac GTO and bought this and it blows the GTO away!  I just purchased Buschur racing stage 1 and 2 and hope to have the car run in the low 12's.  If you want after market parts the sky is the limit for this car.  Great handling in the rain.  Most fun car to drive period.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,Miguel, 10/07/2005,Sweet Ride,5,The 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII is the best car for its price no questions asked.  Its performance is amazing and nothing is more fun to drive.

I had to pay to replace all of this at 3,000 miles.  Mitsubishi knows about this problem.  There are lots of articles out there about this, if you do a little research.  By the time I did my research it was to late, I already bought the car.  They give you this big warranty and look for reasons not to back their product. "

Out of all the cars, this car just blew me away. This is an enthusiast's dream. True it has a bare bones interior but who needs a stereo when you have 285 horses buzzing? Some have said that the 5-speed isn't as smooth as Honda's but it feels much firmer and won't feel like it'll snap off during power shifts. This car won't get girl's attention until you smoke their boyfriend's Porsche. If you want attention, buy an overpriced convertible, if you want performance buy an Evo. BMW's lying..THIS is the ultimate driving machine!   "

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,devildoc, 07/18/2007,Fun car,4,I love my EVO it has got to be the funnest car I have ever driven. I have had no problems with it at all. Even the cops seem to ignore it due to the lack of spoiler. There is plenty of space in the cabin for passengers or boxes. The only thing is due to the lack of fold down seats it is difficult to pack long items like snowboards in it. But if that is really what you are looking for then buy a truck.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2005,roadrocket007, 09/14/2007,Built with a purpose: speed with control,5,"I have driven much more expensive sports cars, with more horsepower, better looking (maybe), more luxurious, etc., but nothing will deliver the same performance package that the Evo does. This is a machine built with one specific purpose in mind: highest level of performance by combining power with precise delivery and control. No car on the road costing less than 100k will give so much road feel, precise turning and confidence like the Lancer Evolution. This car tells you exactly what's going on from the contact patch level to the steering wheel. You can increase the power, handling, grip, etc., for less money than other cars. This is a car for the purist not poseurs!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Amy'sMR, 09/20/2006,Nothing Better in Its Class...,5,"This is my third Evolution. I have test driven several Subaru STi's, but I keep coming back to the EVO. After smoking a Honda S2000 on the test drive...I fell in love with the MR. Honda drivers will not like the transmission, but red line racers will love every ounce of it. I bought this car for one reason and one reason only...PERFORMANCE! I have a loaded 2006 BMW 325xi for long drives. Everything else is my MR. Even my wife loves the car. Its gas mileage is awesome, considering the performance output. If you love performance...do yourself a favor and take a test drive before they are all sold."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,MAX, 11/10/2006,Monster Car,4,The Lancer Evolution MR is safe and fun at the same time.  With the four doors I'm able to fit my little boy in the back seat and three more adults.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,DarkEvo, 10/26/2006,Just Great,4,"This car is the best bang for the buck you can get.  I used to have an Eclipse, and this car builds on that fun factor.  It is very solid at high speeds and will get you in trouble if you don't watch out.  Its gas mileage isn't as good as it was in my Eclipse, but that is expected since you're on an AWD platform now.  I prefer this car much more over the looks of the STi."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,amilcar, 01/04/2007,Fun Car to Drive,4,"The EVO is the best car to drive.  The reason is that you will never have more fun than any other car while you drive. I had many cars and nothing compares to the EVO. However, if you don't own an EVO you should go and get yours now because they are almost sold out in the United States."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,veryslowdriver, 12/13/2007,"Well built, engineered like nothing else",4,"With a small investment in professional tuning - wider down pipe, cosworth cams,  reflash and AWD dyno mapping, this car rated 341 whp and turned 11.9.  This car was solidly constructed high interior and exterior build quality with plain materials.  Sadly, car was impossible to live with.  A small trip across Boston to drop off my son and pick him up from camp was always an unpleasant ride.  This is a car for enthusiasts in rural areas with garage space.  This is a truly fast car. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,PessimiStick, 09/12/2006,It is what it is,4,"So far, the car is exactly what I expected.  It's a race car in street clothing, and it acts like it.  The ride is stiff, the tires are noisy, and the steering will put you into a ditch before you can blink if you doze off.  That said, the car is fairly docile if you stay off the throttle and keep it under 3,000 RPM.  It drives a lot like my old Sentra SE-R under those conditions.  When you open it up however, it's a completely different car, and it more than makes up for any ""luxury"" inadequacies it has."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,On_T1ME, 10/31/2006,MR = Bomb.com,4,"The MR is one of the sickest cars on the road today.  Owning and driving one is like being in a video game.  Not to mention the fact that $1,000 - $2,000 in bolt on parts puts the car over 300 awhp at the wheels.  The MR is on the cutting edge of technology.  Get one while they are still left."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,bryan2314, 04/17/2008,It's amazing!!,5,"This car is by far the best car I have ever owned. It's practically the funnest car drive in the streets. I mean just by feeling the fast spool up,the control,handling, and even the looks, all in one is something you can't even complain about. This car gives you what you want. If you want to go fast, believe me, y'all go fast. It takes mods very well. Any little mod will make your car even more faster. Believe me I tuned this car to stage 1 and I ran 11.8 at the track in a quarter mile. Thats only about $1500 dollars into mods and I'm running in the 11s now. Enough said, this car is beauty!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Megatron, 01/16/2008,Too Good to Be True,3,"I could not be more excited to drive away in my new Evo.  Finally, a bang for buck value that I could enjoy everyday except for when the clutch system melted.  That was the beginning of the end for me.  Don't get me wrong, this car is top speed/handling and all the flash, but after 14500 the clutch is going out and that is not right.  To make matters worse, it is labeled a wear item, not a warranty item.  Simply put, ""buyer beware"".  I would have kept the car, but not knowing if the clutch would be destroyed after another 14,000 and having to spend another $1400 to replace all the parts... I have had enough."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,KT, 04/01/2010,Super Sedan,4,"I bought it new, and now after 80k miles the EVO still puts a smile on my face every time the turbo kicks in.  I never had any problems with it.  I AVG 27 mpg on the highway doing 70- 75 mph."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,PlastikSeraph, 06/18/2006,I Love It,4,"I can't think of a better car than the 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 9, espically for only $31,000.  It's definitely worth every penny you'd pay for it."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Harlow, 06/20/2006,New Evo IX,4,"This vehicle depends on what kind of driver you are.  Not just any old lady can drive this car.  If you are going to purchase it, then you already know of it's amazing capablilty and every word is true.  Scratch luxury!  Performance, power, and handling = fun.  This car is well worth it."

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,James, 06/29/2008,Sweet Ride!,4,This car has it all; big enough for a small family and the performance to make driving anywhere exhilarating!!! If this car doesn't come with the equipment you're looking for then simply look for one and have it installed; there are tons of modifications for this high performance family sedan.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Nawaaz Ismail, 09/04/2008,"""Super Duper Quick""",4,"High-performance ""dream machine.""  Basic mods for this car are a must.  Get a reflash, electronic boost controller, and a turboback exhaust."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,saetern, 11/12/2008,EVO IX,4,"Best bang for the buck.  Awesome car handles in snow better than most trucks I've driven with 4x4.  Power delivery is great, especially with basic bolt-ons and a tune.  This car will give you whiplash so watch out."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Joshua L Ferreira, 04/30/2009,Favorite Car,3,"Driving enthusiasts this is not a car to be ignored, at first drive I was hooked, it surpassed my performance expectations, just an unforgettable experience. You have not lived until u drive an Evo!! Just go out and drive one - you will not be disappointed."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Evo IX, 01/19/2008,I Love This Car!!!,5,"I love my Evo!! The mpg isn't bad at all for all the power. I get about 17 in town and about 28 on the highway. The power is truly addictive. It looks awesome and drives great too. I had a 3000GT twin turbo, but I like the practicality of this car much more, and it looks even better."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,JJsevol, 01/27/2008,Evo 9,4,"Owning the evo has been amazing and fun. The Evo makes the worst driver look like a pro. You buy an evo for performance not for creature comforts, with that said I dont mind the lack of style with the interior. Once you buy an evo you're in a community of its own."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Treston Lorenzo, 01/28/2010,Only the Best,4,"I have owned 3 Evo's Now. The IX MR is the Top of the line for the Evolution's, and is even better than the new 2008's according to a few companies. This model in 06 was the last year for this Body style, and for the MR Edition last year for the Manual 6 speed. Every Evo I have owned has never had a problem other than normal Brake changes, Clutch at around 45-60k miles, but don't forget this is a performance machine. Clutch isn't meant to last forever. Car looks great, Drives even better. You will get no breaks in this car from cops although... just keep it safe and you will be okay. Go to the track to unleash the BEAST!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Alexander roberts, 07/01/2010,Best car ever,4,"This car has made me very happy. I have never had any problem with it. very fast. even with light mods it still makes the car ran like a charm. But the cops will always be looking for you to make a mistake so take it easy and you'll be fine. anyone who drives this car will never be disappointed with the performance, it's a rocket ship."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,buddy#7, 07/02/2010,Got to buy one now!,4,This is my first EVO. And im gonna have to say this is the best bang for your buck. It gets looks from everyone. And yes that includes cops! But if you keep your foot out of it. You will be safe as kittens. It takes mods very well. With 15 to 22 gain in hp with bolt ons. They are also somewhat cheap. Great for 4 whenever you have them. But the power will give them whiplash. So save the power for alone time! But you wont be upset with the AWD its amazing. Its grip and go. Launching is the best. The transmission is great. Smooth. The six speed is a must.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Jim Davidson, 10/22/2005,2006 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution MR Edition,4,"My 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution MR Edition is the second EVO I've puchesed. My first was a 2004 Evo8 which I started tuning right away. I bought it befor the MR Edition was released so when it came out, I was bummed that I didn't have the patience to wait. Now a year later, I was ready to walk in and grab the first EVO9 MR off the lot in central California.  From the first moment you can feel the differnce in acceleration and a gruntier noise form the engine I've taken my EVO 8 to a few autocrosses and have driven several other tuner cars.  Nothing stands up to the handling of an Evo.  Sorry to all the Subaru WRS STi owners out there but the Evo will still beat you through the turns!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,EvoZilla, 10/26/2005,"Fast, Fun, and the peak of Evolution",4,"This vehicle is amazing.  Its is lightning fast, handles like its on rails, and is just exciting to drive.  It's a vehicle that is as fast as a Corvette, handles like a Lotus Elise, and yet can run in bad weather.  I couldn't recommend it enough.  "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,adam patrick, 11/04/2005,Mitsubishi Lancer,5,"Outstanding Car.  The interior isn't quite as stunning as the awesome exterior, but overall there is nothing wrong with this car.  Simply the greatest car I've bought."

Once on the road, press the gas pedal and feel the rush of 286 horses pushing you into the beautiful Recaro seats while the 3 LSD / ACD equipped AWD drivetrain keeps all 4 wheels planted (even in the twisties) solidly to the tarmac, or gravel, or snow!  Hit the brakes and hold on to your lunch as 4 piston front / 2 piston rear Brembos smash you into the seatbelt. This is a driver's car, pure and simple. Drive it and you'll never want to drive anything else again!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Dipakkumar Patel, 02/28/2006,"Don't Read About it, Drive It",4,"The 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution MR Edition is, hands down, the most rewarding and special car I have ever driven. If you love to drive, this is the car for you. There is nothing to distract you from the whole experience. The interior may seem sparse to those who care more for creature comforts, and they will overlook the careful placing of all the knobs and dials. Everything is intuitively placed - no need to look away from the road. If you want satellite radio, nagivation, heated seats, or cruise control - get the gorgeous G35, MazdaSpeed 6, or Subaru STi. This car makes you feel like a star, it feels so refined. It is no boy racer toy. Its ride is more comfortable than you think, incredibly responsive and predictable."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,evo_dex, 03/28/2006,"Impressions after 3,000 miles",4,"The Lancer Evolution MR has a smoother gearbox than the 5-speed, It is always in a perfect gear. 6th is _not_ a highway/cruise gear.  It gets worse epa mileage than the IX / RS. MRs have 30% softer shocks, which equals a better ride. The performance is top notch. Steering is perfect, but may be too twitchy for some. It's a heavy car, and not as planted as people say. slides through corners, but very controllable. even with a 50/50 torque split the MR is a little tail happy and just as unforgiving to inexperienced drivers. As mentioned previously this car gets stares from cops and people in the know, not girls. if you want style+interior get a Nissan 350Z / Infiniti G35. This car is strictly for performance. Also - Mitsubishi under rated the IX by at least 30bhp."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,$30K Porsche Killer, 04/22/2006,"A $30,000 Porsche Killer!",5,"Jump in, turn the key an make sure to leave the door open to hear that beautiful sound. Step on the gas an hear the turbo spool up an watch the needles quickly swing to the right. The speedo goes smoothly all the way to the top. In a canyon this car is like a race car. The steering is very light and insanely quick.  It is so quick that I misjudged a turn an got some curb rash. Taking those turns at the speed limit is much more than fun, it creates a new love for cars. The Recaro seats are very comfy and hold you in very well while pulling those high G turns. The steering wheel fits right into your hands and pedals are placed perfectly. Its a $30 ,000 Porsche killer!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Nobody, 04/25/2006,The best 4-door sports sedan ever built,4,"Where can you find a 2.0 Liter engine that puts out 286 horses and 289 pounds of torque? Only in the Evo IX. This car is the fastest grocery getter on the streets.  The only thing in its class that can be mentioned in the same breath is the Subaru WRX STi.  If you love driving, and I know I do, this car is fun, fun, and more fun.  It has an AWD system that keeps you safe on dry or wet roads, or even on icy roads. With the ACD button to switch between levels of traction there's no going wrong when choosing this car.  It is not for everyone though, because it takes lots of guts not to push this baby pass the speed limit, so if you're always tempted to do so, back off and go get yourself an STi. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,jeff, 05/08/2006,"""Had an STi, Have an EVO""",4,"After driving a '05 ubaru STi for 5,000 miles, I traded it in for a 06' Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The STi is a good car, but the Evolution is a great car! The EVO MR has a lot better every day driveability from stoplight to stoplight, yet the STi is a lot better cruiser."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,MattMR, 07/13/2006,The perfect street legal racing car...,5,"This car is my third EVO. Each generation keeps getting better. The Subaru STi is a close second, but is second. The EVO has better response, a six speedtransmission, a rear spoiler, and driver feed back. Remember that these are street legal racing cars we are talking about. If you want a navigation system, soft ride, and on board computer system that makes Bill Gates blush...you are looking in the wrong spot. If you want a car that will take a corner and accelerate close to a Lambo...look at the MR and STi. The STi has a little bit more ride comfort and Evolution MR is a little bit more race ready."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Event Horizon, 10/15/2005,"Stronger, Faster, Better!",4,"I can't even unleash the full potential of this beast yet because it's breaking-in, but it's already a blast. Its build quality is solid, which I expected since it's built in Japan. It's a solid improvement over the previous generation, even if the changes seem minor on paper."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Garrett P., 10/18/2005,"Lancer Evolution IX , The Legend Continues",4,"If you have been following this car for any length of time, whether it's since you raced it on the original GranTurismo, or saw it driving down the street, this car lives up to the street legend it commands.  One cycle through the gears and before you can blink this machine will launch you into a blissful whir of G forces.  It is everything you can hope for in a one of the most amazing AWD sports compact ever.  The discount on insurance for four doors doesn't hurt."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Purplegodzilla, 03/16/2006,From Skyline GTR to the Evo,4,"Well, this is my first Mitsubishi...I wanted something with 4 doors.  I was tired of having people getting in and out with a coupe.  I had a Skyline GTR R33, but it was totalled in an accident. So I had my mind set on either the Subaru STI or EVO..I chose the EVO because of its ease of tuning.  Aftermarket parts are readily available and cheap, however, I have heard of terrible warranty services from Mitsubishi with the EVO. So if you don't modify your the car, you shouldn't have a problem with the 10yr/100,000 warranty. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,J.G., 03/31/2006,Fun to Drive,4,The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX has amazing handling when driven on the highway. It has great pick up and is smooth when you open the throttle. This car does everything you expect of it to do.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,SDMitsu, 05/25/2006,Drive one before you rush to judgement.,4,"I have 7,500 miles on my Lancer Evo now and I am very pleased. The car is truly amazing whens it comes to starting, accelerating, stopping, and turning whenever and however you want to. I compare it to a cat on carpet. It gets 18-25 MPG depending on how you drive it and it is hard to drive conservatively! The five speed is a little high reving at 80 mph, but provides instant accelleration when prompted.  I have had several people drive and ride in the car since I got it and not a single person has walked away unimpressed. Before you judge this car by it's wing or it's image, drive it. You will be impressed by what it is, a true 4 seat, 4 door sportscar capable of hanging with any car out there!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,Jason, 08/26/2006,My New Evo,4,"This car is great.  It has great power and handling.  The radio isn't the best but it can be replaced.  At first, the ride was rough because the tire pressures were at 45 psi for some reason.  I lowered them to factory specs, 32 psi front and 29 psi rear.  That made a huge difference in the ride.  It is a lot smoother now.  It is not harsh except over railroad tracks or similar big bumps, but that's rough in any car really.  I love this car!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,ramonr, 09/08/2006,Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution,5,The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is very fast and fun to drive.  I would not trade it for any other vehicle!

I drove the Subaru STi and the EVO hard before I pulled the trigger on the EVO.  And, yes the EVO MR is worth the high price tag.  This is not a car for those seeking speed and comfort.  The EVO is a big, tough, raw bully car.  It has one purpose in life, to dominate all that stand up to it.  If making cars that cost 2-3 times as much shake in thier boots at a red light brings a smile to your face, then BUY THIS CAR, NOW!"

This was my dream car, but now owning it and driving it for a whole year, I feel that the price I paid for it I should have gotten more.  Don't get me wrong this car is really fun to drive - in the rain, snow, dry pavement, sand, woods, just about anywhere. The AWD on this is really amazing. The aggressive look of the vehicle is outstanding and I get people from male and female ages 18-60 giving my car the eye.  Oh and by the way I'm a chick.  This car usually appeals to males more than females. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,ydemidov, 05/16/2007,Exactly what it should be,4,"Bought my car a little under a year ago and am loving every minute I spend either driving it or looking at it. Don't be fooled by those saying the interior needs to be upgraded. This car is all about plugging in and driving. If you find anything about this car that you don't like, you should have bought another car. The Evo is so focused on what it does best that after 5 minutes of driving it you no longer care about climate control, cd changers or other creature comforts. This is a true driver's car. No ""ifs"" or ""buts"". If you are serious about driving this is the only car you can buy for under $100,000 that will surpass everything you ever imagined it to be. Simply beyond words."

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2006,ru4real, 11/15/2007,Budget Supercar!,4,"Driving this car opens your eyes to a new paradigm in performance value.  Few cars two to three times its cost can challenge the Evo in overall performance, and they're generally not as practical as this 4-door sedan that can seat 5.  Test drive one if you can find it.  The seating position, steering, power and handling response put you in total control and you always feel connected to the road and confident.  The car's dynamics and AWD system makes it very easy to drive spiritedly, and you must be careful not to exceed your own limits.  You glance away for a second and you might be in the next lane, and passing power is a heartbeat away.  The carbon-fiber wing really keeps the rear planted."

It truly is a great TUNER'S car and the 4B11T engine will easily handle 400hp to 500hp:) The interior is mediocre and the trunk is tiny, but the Recaro seats and RockFord sound system are excellent. Gas mileage isn't too bad, my average is 24-26mpg on the hwy. Draft behind an SUV within my 40 mile commute and my 450hp Evo can get 26-28mpg.

My commute is more city than hwy; MPG avg 14.7 over the yr. Interior scratches easily, esp the trim around the glove box & radio. Rear vis with wing is poor. SST autoshifts slow when cold. Storage space: It is what it is. Trunk for wknd trips is ok (two carry- ons); big items need to go in the backseat (dog carrier). Leather is easy to clean/just wipe down. Front seats are comfortable on long road trips. Perf in bad weather is confidence inspiring. Track (Willow Springs) perf is excellent! Turn off ASC and it's Point and Shoot.

I have the 5 speed.  You are doing around 3,000 rpm at 65mph.  It needs a sixth gear.  At 100 miles the Service Engine Soon light came on. 1) I checked the gas cap  and 2) I am sure it is nothing, but it is still a PITA to go to the dealer and drop it off.  On the positive side, the car is fun with 5 seats.  Give me a few weeks and I will give a good full review. Gotta break it in first."

My notchy went grinding and then ripping, I got a new tranny, im not grinding as bad now, but still grinding.  I love the overall car tho, just wish I had gotten a different one.  I realize people have a lot of notchy issues, hopefully this is something that will play out."

The handling is outstanding; I am amazed at what this car can do on winding roads.  The transmission in this car must be driven to be believed.  In Sport mode, the shifting is crisp and firm.  The downshifts are perfectly timed, and are done better then I can run a clutch after 20+ years of driving.  The logic that controls the transmission is very well set up; I haven't even touched the paddle shifters.  The car is always in the gear that I need."

mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,couldem21, 03/04/2009,Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X,5,"This car is a wonderful driving car. The car handles excellently, and if it is tuned, can put out an exceptional 400hp. Drifting with this vehicle is harder being it is All Wheel Drive but otherwise is a very fun car. The new 2008 mustang gt puts out 300hp and is 1 1/2 times more heavy. Stock this car will smoke all the other cars for the same price. Great on gas, great reliability. The Subaru WRX STI is a great car as well although the latest models of this car are hatchback which is not preferred and do not do as well with handling."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,X MR Owner in LA, 04/02/2009,Most fun with your pants on!,4,"Excellent perf out of the box! Handling is as nimble as S2000, slight understeer. Very little turbo lag as the RPMs climb effortlessly. The TC-SST is superb! Auto is great in LA traffic, and Manual Sport just screams for open pavement. Driven stick my entire life (I'm 29), I welcome TC-SST technology as an early adapter. Shifts fast! Don't have to give up the power as I would driving a torque converter auto! AWD noise is clunky sometimes, and turn radius is a bit larger than I'd like. Gauges need more driver info, but seats are AWESOME. Steering wheel is perfect size. 1 gripe: car has no ""legs!"" Small fuel tank means frequent fill. Overall very happy! Can't beat 0% APR & wife can drive it too! :)"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,JAY, 08/10/2009,Great For The Buy,4,Just bought the car. Put about 1500 miles on her. Runs great. Don't really care about the interior. Bought it just for outside look and performance. Drifted around 80 degree turn at 80mph. Handles great! This is a sports car.....Not made for comfort. Don't buy if you want comfort. I bought it for drifting.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Guitarist30, 11/15/2009,Nothing in the price range to beat it...,4,"Performance? Oh yeah.. I owned the Evo IX and this car to me is MUCH better. It still has the cheap interior, thin paint, and bad gas mileage, but the X is a MUCH more comfortable car overall. I'm not a big aftermarket guy, but a tune really goes a leap ahead of what is already an excellent car performance wise. The S-AWC makes the new safe Evo even more safe than it already is by letting you turn the car suddenly without it even batting an eye. Like others have said and will say a strong 6 speed manual would be nice, but I don't drive fast where I live... the speed limit is still 55 and with the tune and a bit of added timing I can get 24-26 on the highway."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,DrChuck23, 03/15/2008,Great track car; not so great commuter,3,"Lack of overdrive gear really kills highway mileage (3500-4000rpms); really bogs down below 3k rpms, still has turbo lag between 3-5k then starts to fall flat above 5500 rpm.  Redline might as well be 5500 rpm. Handles great but the only way to safely test its limits is at the track.  Don't bother buying unless you plan to track the car at least recreationally."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Seth, 03/27/2008,X GSR review,4,"I'm loving this car so far.  It's a bit heavier than my IX was, but it makes up for it with a vastly superior chassis and substantially better handling potential.  The fit and finish have been improved, the brakes are bigger (since the car is as well), the final drive is a bit shorter, and it now has Mivec on both cam gears with a chain driven system on the new 4B11.  No more timing belt!  Fueling is just pig rich stock.  This car will wake up substantially when an aftermarket ECU solution becomes available to the general public."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Kwiq Niss, 03/29/2008,Exceeds Expectations,4,"Lows Seats and steering wheel should be more adjustable. More choices should be available for interior prestige. Car is hard to find, selection does not exist. Needs a sixth gear on the manual and a tighter gear pattern. Tough to launch without burning clutch.  Highs Quick, Responsive, Amazing Handling, Comfortable (Racing seats are a nice touch, Great Stock Stereo (except lack of PIO adapter), attention grabber (except when its the cops attention)  I have the GSR with Sight Sound and Spoiler package. The car is amazingly fast and smooth. Its extremely fun to drive (which is the most important factor here), comfortable, and immersive. Highs are really high, lows are mostly minor."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,KwiqNiss, 04/04/2008,Exceeds Expectations,4,"My new Evo X GSR has blown me away, but before I get to why, I'll note what's wrong: needs 6th gear in manual, better clutch. At this pricepoint, I expect a few more interior luxuries. Sight, sound and spoiler should be stock. Also, why are the brakes not cross drilled, and why must they leave so much brake dust on my wheels? Highs: great stereo with sight, sound and spoiler. Comfort of drive is extremely high for a car that pulls a lateral G. Insanely fun to drive. Seriously stylish. Outruns anything in its class or the next one up. With Vishnu, HKS, K&N, and NOS, this car will be able to hit 600+ bhp. I believe I can get the 1/4 down to 10s."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,srikanth janga, 05/14/2008,Kicking and Screaming,4,"It's been about 2 months and I've put about 2500 miles of highway and city driving. No tracking done. The vehicle has performed wonderfully. I just transitioned from a 2001 Camry, so my expectations were easily exceeded with this car. I was able to get a test drive at a dealership in Pittsburgh and loved it. The Subaru guys did not let me have one, so I just bought the one I knew I'd like. I also took the 10 year 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty with a 100$ deductible since I do not intend to mod the car much. Its just lovely as it is. I knew before purchasing the car that it was going to be an expensive affair, but I was ready to pay the premium for the enjoyment since I could afford it."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Mike, 05/21/2008,I love it!!,4,"First of all, I am 30. I have owned Trans-Am's and Camaros my entire life. I was in need of a 4 door car and fell in love with the looks of the Evo. I am amazed at the power the little 2.0 liter engine makes with the Turbo. It is such a different driving experience than the torque monsters I am use to, but I love it! It takes turns and curves like it is on a rail. I miss fish tails and power slides, but being able to take turns at speeds my Camaro SS could never achieve makes up for it. I would recommend the Sight Sound and Spoiler package for potential buyers. The bad, seats are a little uncomfortable & need more adjustment options. Had to have factory CPU flash to help acceleration."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Sad Mitsu Owner, 04/02/2009,I will Never buy Mitsubishi again!,2,"We have now owned our 2008 EVO for four months now.  At first, I will say that we were very excited about our purchase.  That was until we waxed the vehicle for the fourth time 1 1/2 weeks ago.  My husband noticed a massive amount of paint chips above the rear tires on both sides of the car and also on the hood.  I searched the web, and found we are not alone!  Tons of people have this affliction, and Mitsubishi has done nothing for most of them.   Do not buy this vehicle unless you want your paint to chip off, or your windshield to chip with 3000 miles on the car.  Very poorly made and will not last. Worst purchase we have ever made as far as quality.  Huge regrets."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,adrock, 06/05/2008,Happy buyer,4,"I was worried about buyer remorse before I bought this car, but now that I have it, I'm glad I took the risk.  I was planning to get a reasonable car, like an Acura or something, but figured you only live once, so I got the Evo.  I have a perma-smile since I drove it off the lot.  The few things I don't like, the driver seat is not very adjustable, the shifts into 2nd and 3rd are kind of clunky until the clutch warms up, the trunk is tiny (not big enough for golf clubs w/ sub, and no fold down seats for snowboard) and the road noise is loud on rough surfaces.  The good, its sharp when you want it to be, and tame on your daily commute.  All in all, not a bad daily driver, and fast."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Evo Owner, 07/24/2008,Great Car but a few warnings,3,"I've had my EVO for about 6 months, and there are two really annoying things about it:  First the paint is super thin and scratches easily, after the first two repairs I've put clear bra on most of the car, so plan on spending $1000 or more on that, and do it before it scratches. (front, rocker panels, and trunk deck)  Second the windshield is wafer thin. Mitsu did this to save weight. I got a minor chip in mine and the windshield split when trying to repair it. I'm replacing it with a standard lancer windshield which is thicker, but heavier. Anyway plan on spending another $350 on that."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Bluesmaster, 07/23/2008,1700 miles,4,"I've had 3 Evo's, and this one is the most daily driver friendly yet. The 5 speed is notchy when cold, but otherwise the car performs well. The handling is truly the best thing about the car. The steering is telepathic, and the brakes are excellent. Power is fair, but the second factory reflash helped smooth things out and helped the upper rpm range. I fixed a rattle in the glovebox, other than that the interior is quiet. Tire noise is high, but the upgraded satellite radio/audio system is superb. Aftermarket parts and tuning solve the power issues quickly and easily."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Old man with evo, 08/15/2008,Make sure you want a sports car,4,"Great sports car, but be ready to make some compromises.This thing is a blast to drive. Most fun car I have owned. Just like the last review, I had to replace windshield at 800 miles.  BUY the clear 3m paint guard, especially front, and rear rocker in front of rear wheel.  Great stock stereo, but no steering wheel control, seats are great, if you fit their ideal size, because they hardly adjust, plus the material is cheap, and wears quick.  This isn't my only car, so it fits me perfectly.  Personally I could use it as a daily driver.  Just be prepared to pay extra for its performance in little items, like tires, windshields, upgrades,  you will want to tune.  Highly recommended."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Nergal, 08/27/2008,EVO X,4,"I have had the pleasure of driving my new EVO X for the last 2 wks and it sure has been a blast.  I Love the looks, handling, power and head turning it causes.  Some just see a lancer, but those who really know, see it for what it truly is: one heck of a driving experience.  I have owned BMW to RX8's and sedans/SUVs in between.  It was a toss between the RX8 R3, 350Z, G37, MB or BMW.  For the cost and driving fun I think it is a great value PLUS it seats 5 and I can take the kids and wife every blue moon to keep her content.  I have not driven it hard (YET) due to its low mileage (got it with 50!) but can't wait to hit 1K miles.  Interior is decent, not sure of the cloth arm rest. 21 again"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Bubba, 10/10/2008,Endless Smile,4,"I leased an 08 GSR two weeks ago and can't stop driving it. The car is amazing. Although it could use a 6th gear the car just wants to be driven.  I am 6'2"" and find the car to be a little tight and probably wouldn't be a wise choice to take on a long trip. The spooling of the turbo and shifting is precise.  It's flat out the best car for the money. I'm 32 and owned a lot of fast cars but I would rate this car at the top. Trust when I tell you it won't disappoint the buyer.   "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Yvette, 11/11/2008,BYE BYE MUSTANG!,4,"So I finally talked my husband out of his Mustang Saleen to go to an import.  Let me say after driving the EVO, it didn't take much!  The car handles amazingly well.  We were torn between the Subaru WRX STI and the Evo.  After driving the Subaru, we felt a bit ""lost"" with the six speed.  I would agree that this car having a sixth gear would not be a bad idea.  I also say that these ""all over the board"" quarter mile times that they are reporting are completely inaccurate for the car. Haven't has the chance to romp on it yet as it only has 200 miles.  For our first Mitsubishi, we are definitely NOT disappointed!"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,rskdsk, 12/07/2008,"Good, but wait for the prices to go down",3,"These cars are good, but not worth the premium over the GSR's.  These cars are overpriced in my opinion.  They are great fun, handle well, good power, and the AWD system is tops. The interior is just so so, the comfort is bad but it is not a cruiser, and the power is good but not great.  I am sure in the next year we'll see all the tuner parts come out hen the fun will begin!  If you have time, wait for the prices to come down.  "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,jimm, 04/02/2009,Great Spors Sedan,4,"After 1yr, still very happy with the purchase.  Easily better than the STi which is more expensive.  Did great through the winter.  Always gets looks and continues to be fun to drive. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,bneufelder, 04/28/2009,Super fun car,4,I bought my Evo and had it shipped across the country without ever test driving it.  I was a bit skeptical but read several reviews and bit the bullet.  Driving this car is exhilarating.  Every time I am behind the will I'm grinning ear to ear.  It's by far the fastest car I've ever driven and for the money it's a steal.
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Andersen, 07/01/2009,2008 GSR SSS/AERO,3,"No test drive, I knew what I was getting into.  First time driving it out of the dealer lot...WOW!  This monster has torque, seats are supportive but very difficult to adjust when reclining.  The interior plastic parts are below average compared to my 06 Civic. The plastics are flimsy and cheap to the touch.  The transmission is notchy [esp. upshifting to 2nd gear and when compared to HONDA tranny]. I've had 2003 WRX so this GSR's tranny isn't that much of a complaint to me."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Mitsu guy!, 07/05/2009,One of the best performance cars!,4,"I had this car for 1 year now and still love the drive feel of the car. One of the best performance cars I ever driven. Exterior looks stunning. Handling is fantastic. Not so good on the gas mileage, especially with small tank (means need to fill up more often), but looking performance wise not too bad. Need better quality interior for the price of the car. As for reliability, need to do something for the stone chips problems."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2008,Smith Chaiyakan, 07/16/2009,Lancer Evolution,4,"Well, this isn't your normal Lancer. Owned this car for 1 year and had no problem but the clutch... I don't even drive hard or launch the car, but around 12k I had to change out the clutch. I ended up getting aftermarket clutch and new flywheel because of the warp. Beside that I enjoy the car and the fun that comes with it. I joined a local car club and ended up mod a bit out of the car... Gas stinks, but it is a 2.0 pushing out near 300hp on a 3k pound car... Love it... Interior is so so if you got the base model, but an EVO is made for driving not luxury."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,notstock, 10/31/2011,LOVE IT! But don't buy it for the Build Quality.,4,"I unequivocally LOVE this car.
Squeaks rattles and endless, monotonous, cheap plastic and all.

I knew going into this deal that build quality and interior materials weren't going to be top notch and I was right.
HORRIBLE rattles everywhere!
I have 5 separate rattles that happen at all different speeds and frequency's. 
 I have a low speed rattle coming from the drivers side door panel, two acceleration rattles coming from the center console and the dash, and a cruising rattle coming from the passenger side dash.
I've been to three separate dealers a total of 7 times to try and fix the rattles with no luck.

But all I have to do is mash the throttle and I somehow forget about the rattl"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,psmith, 03/04/2010,2010 EVO GSR,4,"The handling on this car is amazing.  I was looking for the car that would be the most fun that could carry kids when necessary.  I looked at the BMW1, Mustang, Cooper S, etc.  This is by far the tightest car of them all by a country mile.   I personally really like the look of the car both inside and out and do not feel the interior is any better or worse than other cars, but I don't have much interest in that either.  I also do not think the car is much ""harder"" over bumps than other cars.  The irony is that this car was only supposed to have kids in it as needed, but my wife and kids prefer it over the Toyota Highlander.  They actually prefer the more inviting non-leather seats. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,Jeremy K, 10/08/2010,My Evo,4,"I took home my 2010 Evo MR in rally red after driving all the way to Costa Mesa, CA from Billings, MT. Mine came equipped with the Aero kit, Sport interior, and chrome packages. So far I have loved the car immensely and there is no part of me that expects to get bored with it at all. The SST transmission is amazing and the overall performance is always engaging. My only complaints are poor fuel economy due to the rich factory tune and the slight top-end power drop off due to boost taper (also from factory tune) I am preparing to tune the car which will fix both of these issues and will only make the car better. If you want an exclusive car which definitely makes you feel alive, this is it."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,maldris, 01/21/2013,Still going strong after 2 years,3,"I've had my Evo for 2 years, and it's still going strong. I've kept up with the oil changes and other maintenance check-ups with no problems. 

The Evo's acceleration is very nice - it will kick you into your seat once the RPMs hit 4k (and you can pretty much keep your engine at 4k if you wanted to).
Turbo lag exists, but I only notice it before 10mph - after that, it more than makes up for any time lost. Turning a corner is one of the best things to do in an Evo - it loves corners. When other cars slow down in a corner, the Evo seems to want to do the opposite. It's fancy rally-bred suspension and differential make cornering extremely easy. Simply put, this car is a blast to drive."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,yellowfever, 03/13/2012,Most fun you will have on 4 wheels,4,"I have owned Range Rovers (traded it in for the Evo) BMW's, [non-permissible content removed], have driven Porsche's, Lexus, and Mercedes. The Evo by far is the most fun I have ever had in a car. It just feels so raw. Like a car built for one purpose, to go fast in the turns. If you are particular about the interior you are missing the point of this car. BTW, the interior isn't that bad, at least not on the 2012 I have. Mine is only a month old. I get a rattle every once in awhile but to me that adds to the feel of the car. The vibration caused by the motor and tight suspension causing a rattle just makes it feel all the more ""serious""."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,Bob, 03/30/2010,MR Touring 2010,4,"I sold my 2009 Ralliart for the MR Touring. There is no contest in build quality, performance and comfort. I really have wanted this car since it I first saw it in August. The deal was great and so far for the $$$$$ I feel it is the car for the money. Reminds me of my Audi RS4. Not the interior quality but the performance and looks are all there for $38,000.  Too bad Mitsubishi does not put this quality into their lesser cars like the Ralliart. I know that this is their signature auto so I do get that and my son's GTS build quality was also better than the Ralliart also. I now have become a Mitsubishi Fan."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,m5anchez, 01/05/2010,2010 EVO X GSR (short term),4,"I Traded in my 05 Tacoma for the Evo. The car I drove in high school was 90 bhp Mustang so I may be going through a mid 20's crisis. The interior build quality isn't as good as the Toyota, and you will be filling up the tank every 5 days also cops will pay lots of attention to you. However none of these small concerns matter, I am now getting to work early just so I can drive on the road at 6:00 am w/o traffic."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,jason, 07/01/2010,Save your money or get an STi,4,"Reliability has not been what you would expect in a car of this price range. Plagued with a few issues, now that could cost you an engine,"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2010,snowman4us, 09/14/2010,STi to EVO,3,"I went from a 2008 STi to the 2010 EVO X. STi had a much more pleasant interior, however the seats in the X are amazing. SSS package is a must, and is well worth it. The biggest complaint is overall build quality compared to the STi and the lack of space. Buttons feel cheaper, seating position is not great, even though the seats are amazing. You cant go wrong with either car, but if you want the closest thing to the X you would need to buy a 2011 STi, as 08-2010 don't compare. Paint quality seems to be better then the Subaru, along with less turbo lag (even though its .5 L smaller motor). Probably the biggest difference is fuel economy. The 5 spd is to short and gets 8mpg less the STi got."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2011,bull12, 01/20/2011,the world in your palm,4,"what an amazing honor to be the first to write a review on the 2011 gsr. OK enough with that nonsense, . So as i pull out of the dealership into heavy traffic, it then dawns on me that I'm in a super car, just before a screeching to a halt to avoid hitting the car there in front of I.Now just out of pure luck I finally make it to the highway(30 minutes later). Yes pedal to the metal and as that twin scroll turbo unleashes all fury on that on that unmistakable 4B11, it throws me back in the seat to be overwhelmed with brain crushing torque, then I click to 4th gear, only to look down and see that I'm already splitting hairs at 120 MPH "" oh dang this thang can move"" then I have to pump fluid i"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2011,shaftnmn, 09/22/2011,A Grown Up EVO,5,"I previously owned a 2003 XIII (131K miles) so I have some experience with this model. I use this car as a daily driver so it is not a garage queen. The EVO still thrills after all of these years. The handling and control are amazing and the engine is first-rate. Plenty of improvements over the previous model. The new EVO weighs more and has more things in it but it still has the heart of an EVO when you give it throttle. IMO, it is a great alternative compared to a BMW 3-series, Lexus IS, or Audi A4 for a lot less money. I would recommend the GSR over the MR unless you want paddle-shifting or different shocks/struts and spending an extra $4K. "
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2012,aimwo4, 10/31/2012,Wicked is Right,4,"I spent a lot of time looking for a car with a stick and passing power (i.e., Mazdaspeed3, etc). The Evo unexpectedly has more rear leg room behind my driver seat, then other cars; attribute this to where I need to adjust the driver's seat in order to accommodate my physique. The Ford Escort and Mazdaspeed3 had very little leg room after I got comfortable in the driver's seat. This car loves the high revs.
If you just try to take it easy, it will fight you.
The tranny is only smooth up top.
Take your time shifting at lower RPMs. The ride is hard and the car isn't quiet. I swapped out the tires for All-season DWSs. If you enjoy driving, the Evo is for you."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2012,vampyre, 09/03/2014,2012 Evo MR to rule them all,5,"We traded in our 2005 Evo 8 GSR/SSL for this new 2012 Evo X MR in Wicked White , We purchased the car in Aug 2013 and it has been worry free. This is by far the car that does it all, if you wanted the best of all worlds this is the car to get.. I have owned many different cars over the years and the Evo just does it all. Great all weather performance and head turning style, some of the older folks will not understand what makes this car special, but if you know what an Evo is then you know why the car is special.
My current cars as of writing this list..
Evo X MR
Lotus Elise
Porsche Cayman S
Porsche Cayenne S
C3 Corvette
I like them all, but the best overall car is the Evo."
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2014,havevowillhoon, 04/08/2014,A future classic that you are falling in love!,5,"I brought Evo last winter after looking for a number of $40k range cars. What a great choice! Before, I relax by playing video games. Now, whenever I have downtime, I crave to drive the Evo.

Evo is a wicked fun car. I can say that only the 90-05 NSX, certain 911s and a few Italian supercars can give you more exciting experience. Even the GT-R feels less crispy and exhilarating for daily driving.

I have also learned a few tricked from the forum. When tailgated, take a ramp with cruise control on and watch the tailgater understeers like hell. Get winter tires, and a snow day is the best time to hoon around town and party while others are struck. What's not to love about owning an Evo?"
mitsubishi,lancer-evolution,2014,David Dietrich, 12/13/2015,A rocket on wheels!,5,"It's unfortunate that Mitsubishi is discontinuing the Evolution; it's a racing icon, but I guess all good things must come to an end.  I had my MR for about a year.  I opted for the MR because I didn't want the ""hey cops, look at me!"" spoiler, and I wanted the faster shifts from the TC-SST transmission.  It was a fun car to drive while I had it.  It did consume fuel at a prodigious rate, even if I drove ""nicely.""  However, you don't buy an Evo to get great mileage.  You want great mileage?  Get a Mirage.  You want a car that will grab you by the scruff of the neck and not let go until you beg for mercy, get an Evo.  It would do whatever I asked of it without much complaint, except really MOVE off the line.  MR or GSR, didn't really matter, off the line you have to deal with the turbo, unless you use launch control.  Who has time to muck about with launch control on the street?  Once the RPMs climbed over 3K, the boost kicked in, and then you needed to hold on for the ride and hope your eyeballs didn't pop.  Until then, a 1972 VW Beetle would be faster.  

Even though the interior styling was dated, the amenities were nice.  Power windows w/ Driver side auto up/down, power sun roof, heated seats, Bluetooth connectivity, satellite radio, etc., etc., etc.  No, it wasn't posh luxury, but it was surprisingly well appointed.  I fit 4 adults (3 average and my 6' 4"" 240 lb. large frame) in the car relatively comfortably.  The trunk was on the small side, but that's because the battery, differential fluid and windshield washer fluid reservoirs hung out back there.  So no folding down of the rear seats for extra cargo space, which would sometimes be annoying.

Ride quality ... my grandfather would have called it a ""mechanized buckboard.""  You would feel every little wrinkle in the pavement.  Often in your kidneys.  Sometimes in your teeth for larger bumps/rocks, or holes more than 1/2 inch deep.  However, if you want a car that will devour most of it's contemporaries in the twisties, you'll have to put up with a harsh ride.  Let's face it, you don't buy a car like an Evo MR and expect to have it ride like a Rolls Royce.  It just doesn't happen.

Let's talk about the tires ... the stock Yokohama Advans were pretty good tires.  Once they got broken in (took about 1000 miles for that), and once they warmed up.  Took about 4 or 5 spirited miles on Texas roads in the summer to warm up.  In the winter ... well.  They're summer tires, so it wasn't surprising that they were kinda like hockey pucks in the winter.  Also, after about a year and 14K miles, they needed replacing.  They still had some functional tread on them, but were REALLY close to the end of their useful life.

PROs:
Wickedly fast once the boost comes on; it's glued to the road with unbelievable handling; the Recaro seats make sure you stay put; great visibility; almost telepathic handling; nice amenities in the MR; blindingly fast shifts with the TC-SST transmission; looks better than the STi (honestly, the STi is looking rather dull these days).

CONs:
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty (forewarned is forearmed); stock tires take a while to warm up, but until they do, they're hockey pucks;  Recaro seats are rough on hips, even for slender people; convoluted process to engage launch control on the MR.

Overall, if you're looking for a car that is fun to drive, holds onto the road almost like it's using Velcro, but aren't looking for street drag racing, or you're not particularly concerned with MPG, see if you can get your hands on an Evo.  Just bear in mind, after 2015 you'll only be able to get used models, and odds are, they were driven hard.  You don't get one of these to putter around in it; you get one to DRIVE it.  Just keep that in mind.

So, why did I have the car for only a year?  Because my brother traded his Fiesta ST (a fun, fast hot hatch!!!) for a Mustang GT ... which would
 do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds ... without the need for launch control.  So, I got a Mustang, too ... yeah ... had to.

mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,craig24, 04/20/2012,A Great Sportswagon,4,"This sports wagon is perfect for me. It has everything I want and none of what I don't. 

I wanted; a used, fun-to-drive, reasonably priced, reliable, roomy, comfy, fuel efficient, wagon with great visibility, low insurance and a compromise between sporty handling and good ride quality.

I didn't want; expensive repairs & maintenance, electric leather seats, a sunroof, climate control (A/C button & dials are best), paying extra for a badge, a boring vehicle, an SUV.

The Lancer Ralliart wagon has all of this and more. It's a great car for; commuting, driving spiritedly (it's not fast but sporty and rewarding), highway cruising, moving furniture, grocery shopping, carrying sports equipment."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,ajl, 10/12/2006,Update 10-12-06,4,"My Lancer Sportback LS now has 63,000 mostly highway miles on it and is still going strong. It's been a much better car then my Ford Focus was, although I miss the handling from the Focus and I still prefer manual shifting.  But this is a pretty good automatic and the 2.4 liter 160 hp 4-cylinder runs strong.  My '89 Acura Legend was only 160 hp and it was a V6 that was 2.7 liters in displacement!  A very enjoyable little wagon that has been very reliable and rather fun."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,IowaRalliart, 01/22/2008,Long Term Review,4,Bought our 2004 Ralliart Sportback brand new in February 2005. Just turned 22000 miles (Jan 2008). Knock on wood the car has been free of any problems of any kind. Short of routine maintenance the only thing I've had to do is change a tail light bulb.  Car is comfortable but about 5 hours into a long trip I find myself wishing for just a little bit more lower back support.  Fit and finish is excellent inside and out. For a wagon it's peppy and handles very well. Gas mileage is what I'd expect for a sport wagon and the engine sings over 3500rpm which is when the engine kicks over to the second cam profile. Ride is stiffer but it's suppose to be - sport suspension.  Very happy with the car.

so many say."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,Mike, 04/02/2006,A sporty commuter that'll make you smile,4,"This is such a big change from driving my '00 Corolla. There's more space, the interior layout and design is far more stylish and I absolutely am in love with the sleek and boxy body. Wind has little impact on this substantial vehicle when traveling on the highway and you'll often feel like you're going faster than you really are. The seats manage to be firm, yet comfortable and provide the necessary support during highway trips. The interior looks classy and feels pretty sturdy and not altogether cheap. You won't mistake it for a luxury car but you won't mistake it for an economy car either. The engine delivers spirited performance overall and gaining speed in the highway or city  is easy."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,lighthouse333, 12/31/2014,Love My Sportback; Gets Me Everywhere,4,"Buying this car was a major improvement for me, and I previously owned a luxury sedan. The Lancer is extremely practical, I can easily sit five people and maintain ample comfort room, and in back I can store a great amount of groceries and packages (one of the many pros of having a wagon). I am around 112k miles and the Lancer hasn't failed me once, even when missing an oil change every now and then. Aside from the common Lancer issue with the climate control knob breaking, I haven't had to put much money into the car. Thanks to the reliability of my Mitsubishi I am definitely going to look into purchasing another from this company! (: "
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,MD driver, 03/04/2010,Buy it if it is cheap,3,"When you need a cargo space, there is no better choice than this car, really. Mivech works great and runs surprisingly good for a wagon.  In reliability and built quality, this car will not be as good as any other major Japanese makers, but again, this car got cargo space that no other matches, at least with good gas mileage of a car instead of an SUV.  So, there is only 2 reason to buy this car, cargo space, cheaper price, at least in used market, Mitsubishi goes way cheaper than Toyota or Honda. If money and cargo space is important to you, this car is for you.  "
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,Don Andretti, 02/08/2009,Storage and performance,4,"I bought this new. The seats are great, the head rests sit perfect so I can leave my head on the head rest while driving. The roof rack is great to hold cargo box. Suspension is stiff enough that the cargo loaded down for camping is forgotten about. I normal drive with a tool box in back and corners and pulls like a sport coupe. I bought this to keep up with my Datsun 280ZX that I still drive. The Sportback will out straight line and corner the Z but will not give you the precise feedback of the Z saying that about a wagon that gets the same MPG as My Z is amazing I now have 66k miles on the Wagon.

I like everything about it and the price is right, now I have two, I bought one for my daughter, I traded in a Fordd Focus Wagon.  There is no comparison, I wish they were continuing to make the Sportback but I guess they didn't go over and they discontinued the model.  Get one while you can, they are getting hard to find."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,GeoN, 07/08/2005,Very Sporty Wagon,4,"Wanted manual trans but only automatic was available. Turned out it is a great auto trans, always seems to be in the right gear and shifts smooth. Car is great for carrying bicycles with roof rack because it's low enough to put them up without a step ladder. Lots of room for sports stuff inside, too. Accessory soft cargo liner saves the interior & looks good. Motor is surprisingly powerful and seats hold you in place for spirited driving. Could use better fuel mileage: avg 20 in town. Open road trip mileage OK at high 20's. It is the best combo of fun to drive and practical livability I could find."

Have to say that I still love this car!
I've kept up with the annual maintenance, use fully synthetic oil and high-test gas, and it runs great.
Smooth and quiet. One major repair -- the A/C -- in all this time.
Everything else has just been regular maintenance.
Love that it has good pick-up when I need it to and that it's got enough power to handle mountainous roads.
Even after 10 years and 155K miles, I still get 25 MPG city / 31 MPG hwy."

mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,Ping, 12/29/2007,A fine vehicle,4,"I just finished driving it hauling a 1500 lbs 5 by 8 moving trailer from Florida to California in 4 1/2 days. The longest day was acroos Texas, 750 miles day. No problem what so ever!! If you can be really gentle on the gas pedal like myself, 24mpg with that kind of load is possible. On the hills it struggles a bit. The sweet spot for the rpm is arond 2200 to 2600. I found that at the 4th gear this would give you 50~63 mph and really efficient. 32~35mpg on the high way is possible if you do this constantly. I had the car for more than 3 years now. Admitted, it is not a luxury car, but it's practical and you can almost say it's fun to drive."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,Ralliart fan, 12/09/2004,Excellent sports wagon,4,The Ralliart wagon offers an impressive compromise between excellent well controlled handling and a comfortable ride. The engine is surprisingly powerful and the tranny downshifts quickly and smoothly. Build quality is exceptionally tight and the structure is very solid. I found no defects on my car at all. The cargo area has lots of storage nooks and offers quite a bit of space. The knee level liftover height makes loading extremely easy. The front seats hold you in place well but could be more comfortable. The rear seat reclining feature is nice as is the ability to fold flat without removing the headrests. Very roomy interior. The warranty can't be beat!

This baby scoots when needed, love the exhaust note, very comfortable, I love the simplicity of the guages and control knobs. I'd love to buy another and keep it for a spare in case this one gets hit. My only complaint is the gas mileage: 20 in town, 25 on the highway. "

suspension - handles great right out 
the showroom! Also, surprisingly good 
stock stereo. 

But after 300 miles, I got this

mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,Ajl, 02/22/2006,Update-2-22-06,4,"In my first review of the car (after just purchasing it) I said I was concerned with reliability.  After 30,000 miles in 6 months, my fears have been unfounded so far. I have only made one trip back to the dealer for a minor problem.  Its fuel mileage is OK, as mentioned the real culprit is the small fuel tank. I get about 25-27 mpg in the mix of driving I do (usually about 40% city / 60% highway).   Paint is irritatingly cheap tough. My car already has lots of swirls and scratches and I generally don't use automatic car washes.  As was also mentioned, road noise on the highway above 65 mph in this car is obnoxious. The seats are OK, but were never designed to spend hours in everyday.  It does seem to run better on high octane fuel."

The 6 speaker stereo system sounds amazing. There is so much room inside, sometimes I feel like I am drving an SUV or Pickup truck.  I would recomend this car to anyone who goes to the beach, or fishing, or plays sports, or goes camping or to anyone who likes to drive a quality car. Mitsubishi did I great job with this car, its a real shame they had to take it off the line.  I hope its brought back."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,Tim, 07/17/2005,Ralliart Supporter,4,Purchased in August 2004. Vechile has been excellent in -40 degrees to plus 40 degrees. Build quality is excellent. Service from dealer is very good. Only fault was squeeky rear bushings and fan door rotary switch. All replaced under warranty in a flash. Excellent winter and summer handling. Goodyear RSA's are poor versus Brigestones.
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,ajl, 09/02/2005,Get one if you can...,3,"I traded an '01 Focus ZX3 in on this car, which was a leftover '04 that the dealer was selling for $4,000 under sticker. At sticker, I probably wouldn't have bought this car, but I consider it one of the best bargains I've ever got. My only complaints are that the gas mileage could be better, the A/C controls feel cheap, as do some other interior pieces.  But I'm glad I bought this car instead of a Focus wagon. Someone estimated that there are only about 3,000 of these cars in the US, so it is rather rare to spot another Sportback.  My only question is long term reliability and durability, Mitsubishis seem to be hit or miss in that department."

I love the room in it and the way it looks...sporty and practical.  It has quite a bit of interior space...I am 5'10"" and my husband is 6' and there is ample room for our two children.  There is more room in the rear seating than a full size SUV that we were testing.  The cost was $14,500 out the door.  This is one of the best buys remaining out there.  My husband sold a roadster some time ago...but now he says that it has been recreated in this Lancer Sportback Ralliart.

I found a fully loaded leftover 2004 Mitsubishi Lancer Sportback LS sitting on the dealer's lot and after negotiating with the dealer ended up buying it for $4,000 under invoice.  Overall, I am very happy with the way the car drives and handles, but at highway speeds the wind noise can be almost deafening.  I have to turn the volume control on the factory stereo up to about 30 so I can hear it over the wind noise.  Other reviewers have complained about gas mileage but the real culprit here a fuel tank that is too small.  The mileage isn't really that bad. "

It has broken down on me twice with my two kids in the car. I had to wait hours for a tow truck. Thankfully the tow and repair were covered (yet the whole process still cost me $600 in ""necessary"" (according to the dealership) tune up fees, plus the cost of a rental car. Not four months after my tune up, my car broke again. The first time was a faulty crank sensor (whatever the heck that is) and second time was some accelerator sensor. Oh and they also had to fix a leaky shock and the mid rear restraint that never worked off the lot. Buyers beware. I;m done with Mitsubishi. "
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,Alex, 03/22/2007,"Good engine, poor interior",3,"This car has a smooth, powerful 4-cyl engine tucked inside a body of average quality. It runs quietly, great acceleration and quick handling, with plenty of power for nimble highway and city driving. The frame is moderately stiff, and the ride can feel a little rough at higher speeds. The exterior design is cool, looking almost like a Volvo wagon from the rear. However, the paint job is horrible, easily scuffing and flaking after the slightest scratch on the bumpers or quarter panels. The console and dashboard designs are logical, with controls well spaced and easy to access, but the function of the cheap plastic controls is terrible, as is the design of the windshield defrost vent."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,AJL, 06/01/2007,Update,3,"I have stopped using the car for business (see previous reviews) and have started using it for commuting. The car is still holding up very well and has been one of the best cars I've ever owned mechanically.  Still no squeaks or rattles, engine uses no oil between changes. The storage space is excellent for a small wagon and the overall performance of the car  My only big complaint is that fuel mileage is awful and has decreased big time since I began all-city driving. I'm now lucky to average 18-19 mpg around town, which is absurd for a small, 4 cylinder wagon. I'm fairly conservative driving it 90% of the time, although I do like to have fun now and then."

mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,R.Rollins, 09/13/2016,Great little grocery getter!,4,"Got my 2004 Sportback Ralliart in 2009 with 26,000 miles.  This car has been fantastic and is affectionately referred to as my Swiss army car.   Now at 106,000 it has had nothing buy routine maintenance.  Engine is still strong, interior held up very well with no rattles or squeaks from rubbing components.  The cargo space is great including the gear storage tray under the boot floor, which has been the permanent home for tools, climbing gear, misc. camping supplies and all those small things you should have brought but always forgot.  I can fold down the seats and fit my ski's and 29er Mt. bike or throw in some blankets and camp for the night with my 150 pound Rottie by my side.  It's no speed demon but certainly no slouch either.  Yearly 10-12 hour trips to the Carolinas have been comfortable and stable averaging 85 mph.  I can pass at high speed with ease & jump into highway traffic from a stop without concern.   The only cons I have experienced are the following: 1) The cooling fan has always run intermittently, even 2-5 minutes after the car is turned off. From what the forums say, this is known but never recalled for a fix.  2) I have had consistent uneven wearing of the break pads? 3) Factory replacement parts are stupid expensive from the dealer!  OEM exhaust was $1300 + & only one company makes a aftermarket stainless steel replacement for the down pipe (Eastern Aluminum) at roughly $375 with CAT+ $400 (+/-) for the magnaflow CAT Back in stainless steel.  While the aftermarket stainless Steel down pipe is less expensive, the flexible bend before the CAT  turns to [non-permissible content removed] after a year of harsh NEPA winter driving and was replaced 2 times under the 1 year Mfg. warranty.  4) Factory paint job was crap!!  Bare spots around hood edges and sun fading on all surfaces.  The only place the Ralli red color held was the plastic bumpers. With only 3000 or so imported to UAS in 2004 it's definitely a rare animal to see around town.

mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2004,David G, 03/02/2017,You will get noticed in this car,5,"We purchased this 2004 car new from the dealer back at the end of 2005 with 46 miles on it. Mitsubishi had done no promotion of it and it sat unloved for almost a year at the dealer. We were replacing our 2001 Honda Odyssey after it was totaled by a bad/unfocused driver on the highway. We test drove nearly 70 new vehicles before we drove this one. It grips the road and the driver feels very connected without being beaten by it. It lacks many bells and whistles, but there is something so pure about the experience that it is hard to explain. There are faster and better MPG cars all around, but few can haul as much and look so unique doing it. I get thumbs up and comments from EVO guys all the time. It is like a secret held between those that know. I had a guy follow us into a parking lot to ask about it. He first thought it was a Volvo C70 wagon that had been chopped. When I have it waxed and shining, it still looks good. PROS: It can haul nearly as much as our Honda Odyssey did, but it is smaller. It sounds tough (the kid in me likes that). It has enough zip to get you moving as needed. It grips the road and the sway bars make the curves fun. This is a very mechanical car making it feel very connected to the road, in a good way. CONS: Parts are difficult to find for this car and they are moderately expensive. It has some EVO parts, some Lancer parts and some Ralliart parts. The AC blew and it took two weeks to get some new and second hand parts to fix it. I hit a huge pool of water during a nasty storm and now we have squeaking from the shock bushings. The shocks are still good, but I may have to replace them. OVERALL: I would buy this car again without hesitation. I know a day will come when finding parts becomes too painful and I will have to sell it. I hope it will go to someone that loves it as much as we do.

I have an 2009 Audi TT 2.0/Quattro I drive when I'm not going to work.  When I'm driving the Lancer, I often wonder where the $20k difference in price is. The Lancer has many of the same features like auto. headlights and wipers, heated leather seats, pwr windows, ABS/ATC/ASC, 4 wheel disc brakes,anti-theft system, 18"" aluminum wheels(extra $850 on the TT), cruise control, paddle shifters, steering wheel mounted controls, automatic temperature control...  So where is the difference? The Lancer exceeds the mpg rating. I'm averaging 30 with mixed driving. Plus the Lancers 6CD sound system puts the Audi's to shame."

So far, great car to drive. 4WD is amazing. Drove this winter in Indianapolis with 8+ inches of snow and past countless SUV's and trucks. Turbo is great so far and no issues.

A few problems: The car has a sport pack option which includes an aluminum gas tank cover. If you live in a colder region, avoid this option. The gas tank cover does freeze under 25F. The Rockford navigation system is a bit awkward and takes some time to adjust. Voice command inside the car is hopeless. Also the rear window in the sport back has poor visibility. "
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,Tony Sam, 09/28/2009,I Would NEVER Buy it Again,3,"The ride is awful - its the worst I have ever experienced in any car Ive driven in the last 40 years. Very small bumps are okay and smooth roads great. But any other size bumps are bad jolts and very uncomfortable. Road noise is pronounced because poor insulation. The rear view is awful - obstructed by low hatchback, head rests in the back seats, and if people sit in the back seat, it's hard to see anything. And this causes problems parking and backing up and can cause the car to be accident prone. The stability control is not perfected as it doesn't always stop straight. Fuel economy is well below competitors, Toyota, Honda, Kia, etc. The cheap plastics on the dashboard cause easy scratches."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,Sport Sally, 10/14/2009,A Real Good Looker,3,"This car is more suited for long highway drives with very smooth roads. It is like a horse that needs you to let out its reins. It holds the road well at high speeds and the engine does not even labor a breath - even at 90. However this is not a good city car because of poor gas economy during non-highway driving and hard to park because it's wide and not too easy to see behind you because of an excessively slanting hatchback; and the imperfections on city streets shake the whole car making the city ride very unpleasant. Although the highway ride is much better, it is still below average in comfort. The dealer test drove me on a very smooth road. I was  unaware of this problem until after buying."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,scott90278, 10/24/2009,I love this car!!,4,"I just got my 2010 Lancer Sportback and I am loving this car! The car handles like a tight performance car. You will feel the road because it has 18"" wheels, but it is not uncomfortable at all. When I am at lights people give me thumbs up on the looks. You can't get a better car for the price. The dealer I got the car from gave me the car at invoice and it was the best purchase my wife and I have made in a long time. My neighbor loved my car so much he might go out and get one as well. This car is a good balance of value, cargo space and good mileage. Go test drive one today and you will not be sorry."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,Odin, 11/17/2009,Now we have an Evo-Hatch!,4,"Got the car a few weeks ago, fell in love with this Turbo-Hatch! No doubt about the performance, it's all from Mitsu rally gene: Never felt turbo- lag; Reaction is lighting fast (in sport mode with the twin-clutch); AWD lets the beast stick on the road all the time no matter how terrible the weather/condition is; Plus the brilliant Rockford stereo and Recaro bucket seats making the ride as such a pleasure... Well, there are tons of good things making you forget about the tough riding though. Besides, if you were enjoying the sporty driving, the engine ""noise"" would double the fun then. Since it's a Turbo+AWD, you need to save some pennies for the Premium gas and maintenance for sure. Good luck!"
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,polli, 12/06/2009,Lancer Sportback!,4,"The sportback has been a great vehicle and tool that I can use day to day and have a little fun while I'm at it.  The engine is strong, and the lower gears pulls pretty hard and therefore really quick. I just wish the 4th and 5th gear ratios weren't so close. Also it would have been nice if this was offered in a 6 gear manual transmission. "

I drove a few cars before landing on this one. I just could not find a car that matched the fun and sporty feel for the money.

mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,Adam , 05/16/2010,There is MORE to this car than you think,4,"This is a great alternative to the others in its class. Awesome looks, great handling & it is pretty quiet. The ride is very good on the expressway, but around town on less than average roads, it tends to buck a bit. The hatch offers more space than the sedan. But IMO, the taillights are the biggest let down VS. the sedans. The CVT is for the people who want mileage over performance. You can play with the paddle shifters & NEVER have to worry about over-revving the engine. It still steps out nicely, but you won't win any drag races off the line. My mileage has been for the highway doing 70-80: 29.3 mpg & keeping a solid 55 MPH pace I get usually over 35. Around town I normally get about 25"
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,donnie, 08/10/2010,Wandering steering,3,Car is nice and looks great but it bounces all over the road. Feels like the struts are weak and its really hard to keep the car going straight down the road. I'm taking it to the dealer lets see if they do anything.
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,joe, 09/07/2010,Great sports average car,4,"I think it's a great car.  It has a good looking design.  While it's not totally up to par with the Mazda3, it is still excellent.  The fuel mileage is not the best, but then again it's a sports car.  I've been told by the passengers that the room in the back seat is surprisingly spacious.  Great stereo system.  Feels great to drive"
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,David M., 09/28/2010,Really enjoy the car,4,"I was looking to replace my 2004 Mazda RX8 which was no small task especially considering I didn't want a dedicated sports car. I tried a lot of cars and kept coming back to this car. It is not the fastest but the AWD, the dual clutch transmission, and the look really sold me. It is fun to drive and handles fairly well and does not beat you up with an overly stiff ride like most sporty cars. I regret not opting for the Recaro package as I have a bad back and the standard seats cause discomfort on long drives (seat upgrade is in the works). I wish it had telescoping wheel, the turn signal is ridiculously quiet, and the horn is the weakest I have ever heard. Great car for the money. Love it."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,chefk, 05/30/2011,"Just bought a 2010 Sportback, still new on the dealer's lot!",4,"So I saw the local Mitsubishi dealer had a few 2010 Mitsus still on the lot. The 2011s are on their way out so I decided to see if I could get a bargain. I found my Black on Black Lancer GTS Sportback sitting there. Why it was still there I have no idea.

Beautiful car. Performs great, handles great, and I am getting great gas mileage. The dash display give plenty of MPG info to keep you driving smart and still maintains it's sporty nature.

Some reviews complain about the plastics in the interior. One thing the fail to mention is that the dull finish plastics do not reflect the sun. Glare is practically non-existant in this car. I think the interior is comfortable."
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2010,evsosa82, 07/07/2011,FINALLY!!!,4,"I wanted the '11 but the selection on colors and models was outrageously slim. They say it's due to the earthquakes, which I don't doubt, but I think it's mostly because they have SO many '10 models left. MSRP was 24k, bought it for 19K (excluding tax and license)+ tint + 4 yrs free oil change. The car handles really well, the look is what sold me, storage space is ample, leather seats are a minus, the paddle shifters are fun but I think the GTS should be comparable to the SI and SPEC-V. Overall, what I got for the price is more than I could have asked for. It has the sporty but classy look I was looking for. "
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2011,Candy Adams, 01/30/2017,I love my car!,5,"I had been shopping for another Honda until I found the Mitsubishi Lancer Sportback. It has easy access to the storage area in the back and handles wonderfully. It is also very fun to drive. I highly recommend this type of car.

mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2012,mitsu12, 02/10/2012,Bang for the Buck,4,"I wish that Edmunds would have been fair on the review of the Lancer GT Sportback.
Maybe they can explain why no Data is shown for performance times and braking distances.
While I do agree that the CVT Trans feels different, why don't we let the performance numbers do the talking.
If you want the vehicle to feel like a normal transmission just use the auto stick or the paddles and you will feel right at home. The car rides firm but smooth, the brakes are excellant, the back seat room destroys the competition, the cargo area with the rear seats down is class leading. Warranty is GREAT and the number one reason to buy a GT is of course its great looks!!! and you won't see one at every light"
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2012,CC, 06/03/2017,Underrated,4,"Very unique appearance.  You will almost never see another one.  Has been the most dependable car I've ever owned.  I've done nothing but routine maintenance. Driven 107k miles in less than 4 years.  Great handling, but needs more horsepower (148HP I think).  Not a fan of the CVT transmission, but acceptable once you get used to it.  If you want extremely dependable transportation with unique looks at a great price, this is a good candidate.  Sucks that the resale value is weak though.  I can't understand why.  I'm more than satisfied with mine.
"
mitsubishi,lancer-sportback,2012,Chuck, 12/14/2018,Old Faithful,4,"Solid vehicle.  One of the few remaining Japanese cars really built in Japan.  Very well built except for the plasticky interior.  Bought new and after owning it for almost seven years, this car has given zero problems.  Just the usual fluid changes, oil, coolant, tranny, etc.  One battery and brakes (Really impressed with the drivetrain quality)  I won't disagree with expert and consumer reviews on the interior design and materials... This seems to be the area where Mitsubishi applied all the ""Cost Cutting"" measures.  Lots of cheap feeling plastics mainly on the dash.  They could have improved this a lot with just slightly better design in my opinion.  Other area that is a letdown is the paint, it chips and scratches super easy and I mean super easy.  It's a good idea to keep it waxed and polished like I have.  All in all the car has outstanding quality and I never feel that is going to leave me stranded anywhere.  In general Mitsubishis depreciate a lot which could be a good thing if you are looking for reliable and cheap transportation.  I won't even be bothering trading in this car, luckily my teenage son wants it so he shall have it and I am sure it will provide another seven years of trouble free motoring.

It has a full frame and is a true off road vehicle.  Although we never drove it off road, it can handle the worst of snow storms any snow belt can offer.  Even though a full off road vehicle, its ride is very comfortable, and doesn't beat up the passengers.  It has pleanty of room for seven yet is not so large, making parking easy.  After 77,000 miles the Montero Endevor looks like the day it was bought, and has had no problems - not even minor problems except one.  Some or the original trim screws have had to be replaced with stainless steel screws because of rust developing on them."

mitsubishi,montero,2000,PacNWdriver, 02/04/2005,"Solid and a ""real"" SUV",4,"I did a lot of research on this one before buying and it is by far the most reliable aside the Toyota Land Cruiser, just as capable and much more affordable. The track record of the Montero speaks for itself when it comes to reliability. I traded a Land Rover Discovery for it and the Montero is by far a better SUV, inside and out. The 4 wheel drive is similar to LR with the locking differential, but much easier to engage and disengage than the LR. The exterior design of the 2000 year is a unique one-of-a- kind and a cross between the old and new style (2001+). It is still truck like, but is one of the most capable SUV's off road and on. Plenty of light and fresh air from the huge moonroof too."
mitsubishi,montero,2000,AlisaAnn, 08/03/2005,Nice Look---wish it was a smoother ride!,4,"We bought our 2000 Montero used in 2003.  I loved the way that it looked, people mistake it for a Land Rover.  And it rode very nicely.  But over time, the ride has become more rough.  I just put new tires on it thinking that would give me a smoother ride, but it really hasn't, and my mechanic cannot find any reason for it to be riding so rough.  But I do still love the way that it looks, and we have had no major mechanical problems--the only thing we've done in 2 years, besides the routine maintenance of course, is have the brakes worked on, and replaced the tires.  All in all it has been a good car."

It's been a great vehicle for me as a single mom offering value, room (7-passenger seating), comfort and excellent reliability.  At 160K miles (now remarried) my husband wanted me in something newer, but I would have been glad to keep driving it until it just fell apart. The paint still shines, the interior has held up well considering all that my children put it through.  Maintain it and it will love you back. BTW, I didn't trade it in, I couldn't let go and I'm not one to get emotional about vehicles."

Not a common problem though as I have not heard of anyone else having this issue. This vehicle is simply a perfect balance. The V6 is peppy though not a hot rod, gets decent fuel economy for a full size SUV. Can seat 7 if needed, or hold lots of cargo, and takes only seconds to go from cargo van to people hauler. Good quality replacements on the tires, and brake pads cure wear issues. Got 78K out of 1st set of tires, and about 40K out of brakes. I get 16 mpg city/21 HWY."

The headliner scratches VERY easily.  and the seat belt clips that hold the belts in the third row (from banging around) break off VERY easily if you don't remember to take belts out."
mitsubishi,montero,2001,Dan McKane, 03/01/2003,Poor build quality,2,"This is a nice looking & riding SUV. 
It's heavy and under powered with the 
200 hp V6. It is well equiped and well 
thought out. The build quality and 
manufacturer warranty are not 
acceptable. I have had a few problems: 
the paint on the lower part of the SUV 
was peeling/falling off, a part for the 
anti-lock brake system - it is on it's 
3rd one, the aluminum wheels were badly 
pitted after just on winter. I had to 
wait more than 3 mo. to get the 
district service manager to look at the 
wheels and they were finally replaced. 
(they are pitting again) Not what I 
would expect from a $36,000 vehicle."

any situation. It has provided me with 
all the requirements needed for driving

capabilities and adapts to any 
environment very well. The interior is 
top quality and the special features 
are incredable."

Front windows have extra tint to match factory tint.  The sunroof also has extra window tint to keep inside really cool.  The front of the SUV has a bug and wind spoiler.  Great Michelin Tires package.
mitsubishi,montero,2001,Bob TN, 03/30/2008,real 4x4,4,"Forget jeeps or land rovers, the Montero is better offroad than any car I've ever been in. The 3.5L engine coupled with its five speed auto gets 0-60 in 7 to 8 seconds. I have never had one single issue with it in 95,000 miles. great truck, with ultra low axle ratio, my Montero can light up tires in 2wd but only hovers around 12 and 16 mpg"

mitsubishi,montero,2001,Brian John, 06/01/2008,140k later,3,"I bought this with 17k on it, the dealer had replaced the brakes already. At the time it was the only 7 passenger SUV built on a car frame. It drives great but eats brakes and tires. Gas mileage is 18-22 with less aggressive road tires. I had an issue with the antifreeze disappearing because of a broken cheap plastic T that hooked up to the rear heat. This blew out the cam seals. Right front wheel bearings exploded under 100k. Overall, a good family truckster that should go another 150."

mitsubishi,montero,2001,Swediemom, 01/29/2010,Love My Ride,4,"My Montero is great. I like that it rides more like a car than a truck. I like the V6 engine because it doesn't use as much gas. I sold a ""Luxury SUV"" so I could enjoy the Mitzi more. No mechanical problems. The ""Luxury SUV drove rougher like a truck and often felt that it would flip, but the Mitzi doesn't.

mitsubishi,montero,2001,Zee-Montero, 08/06/2002,Average vehicle in its class,3,"The exterior is catchy and the interior is not bad. However the interior is 
anything but quiet.  Any pebble on the road will cause all sorts of noises to 
emit from the dash area, cup holder, center console and some mysterious 
noise in the rear that the dealer is unable to locate and fix. Imagine taking 
this vehicle off-road and the noise is unbearable. Lacks power. V6 is not 
good enough. Handled fairly well on the snow covered roads 
in Tahoe. For around the same price range you can get a Sequoia, Land 
Rover or a Tahoe. Which are better options for the price you pay in comfort, 
power and resale,"

reasonably priced vehicle to own. 
Problems with chipping paint on bottom 
panels after 2 months and fights with 
Mitsubishi to warranty/repair it should 
have been the first red flag. Since 
then, very poor brake design, pads 
expensive and require frequent 
replacement. Other expensive broken 
items; computer display (replaced 2x 
and still not able to adjust clock in 
all temps),elect.antenna, fuel door

ownership, all I can say is that I am 
glad I chose the Montero.  The dealer 
did replace the moulding on the 
driver's side passenger door (the 
driver's door was pinching the 
moulding).  The brakes have a tendancy 
to ""glaze"" after 6k miles.  When the 
brakes are clean, this thing can stop 
like it ran over super glue.  An 
inherent problem with every Monty (new 
body) is that there is a whirle/rattle 
sound from under the car when you are 
stopped and the car is in park.  The 
dealer thought it was a rock guard.  It 
turns out that it was some pulley 
tension mechanism in the engine that 
they are going to replace."

that I'd say.  The engine really doesn't give 
you enough zing when you want to 
accelerate hard.  And it's gas mileage 
doesn't make me exactly ""excited"".

That said, more power would decrease the 
gas mileage even more.  And while this IS 
an SUV, I knew what I was getting into when 
it comes to paying at the pump before I

mitsubishi,montero,2001,Tundrapie, 01/31/2005,"OK SUV, 12 mpg, Poor Mitsubishi Warranty Work",3,"Major gripe first.  My Montero had it's paint applied very poorly from the factory around the rear window.  The dealer acknowledge the problem.  Mitsubishi corporate though said since it was after the normal warranty period they would not be able to pay for a fix even though it was faulty workmanship from the factory.  That cost me several hunder dollars to fix on my own.  Frankly I wouldn't buy another Mitsubishi because of this.  Moving on, this is a very fun SUV to drive offroad, but it is as slow as molasis on road.  5 speed auto helps up to 50 then it just crawls.  Abysmal gas mileage.  I'm a stickler for these things and mine gets 8 mpg city and 16 highway (22 mpg if I drive 55 mph!).  Overall 12."

it's costly to purchase. What do you 
expect? It's a big, heavy, luxury SUV! 
It rides beautifully, is 
extraordinarily comfortable, has 
premium ""touch & feel"", and is just 
plain lovable!! I drove nearly every 
SUV built today (Hummer & Cadillac 
being the exceptions) before choosing 
this gem, and to me it rivaled a

loved the look.  The new curves and the
molding were very surprising. The
interior was very nice as I expected.
After driving it, I fell in love with
the nice ride.  It was also fun to have
people take a double look at the SUV
when they saw it riding down the road. 
After years of driving it, I must say
that I still like it.  Unfortunately, my
liking to drive it is overshadowed by
frequent visits to the dealer for
repairs.  With 60,000 miles, this
vehicle has had two brakes jobs, five
radios, and ten sets of headlights, just
to name a few.   Anyway, my point is, of
the vehicles I have owned, this one is
the most expensive to own. "

for obviously different reasons, the

I've owned. That comparison includes 3 
Toyota 4-Runners - great cars but 
lacking the creature comforts of the 
Montero. Apart from a few factory 
recalls and a failed O2 sensor in the 
emissions system (ouch) this has run 
flawlessly for 39,000 miles and 
carried me comfortably all over south

that after the exterior appearance, 
things appear to go down-hill in a 
hurry.  I read several reviews & have 
to ask all those people, how can you 
provide a ""performance"" value of 
greater than ""5"", & then state that the 
vehicle is wholly underpowered?  Yep, 
the gas mileage sucks a bit also, but 
to be expected in a 6,000 pound vehicle 
s'porting a whopping 200 HP engine!
Breaks are substantially under-
achievers if you consider all of the 
break replacements you'll need.  Paint 
is also a problem.  But the interior,

It's quite on the freeway, it has plenty of power to merge on the freeway, viability is also really good. The seats are comfortable too, and best of all the family is happy, my wife wants to steal it from me. It did have 2 manufacture recalls, one on the headlights and one for the gas tank if the vehicle should roll over. Both fixed by the dealer, I had them check out the suspension, shocks and everything else, they said it was all original but that everything was in perfect working order. I just put new brakes, tires and hose's and drove it to Santa Fe New Mexico from Phx, it was a nice 1400 mi round trip for our family of 4. 
A lot of people complain about milage, and I will say it's not the best, but I'm good with it. This SUV is better than my 98"" Expedition when it comes to milage and it's easy to maneuver.

He really enjoys driving this car because it was his favorite car when he did his research. For me I love this SUV. If Mitsubishi would add a V8 then the gas mileage would be much worse. But since it's a V6 you can actually add parts to the engine to make it faster. The best thing about this Montero is the moonroof it has. It's very big and stylish. You can also add stepbars to make it better looking and much easier to get in. No problems. Mitsubishi did a nice job on the Montero. But the 2003 and newer look uglier now. Also you can and I recommend install an alarm with car starter.

I've replaced bearings in the front on both sides and a muffler after 200k.
I've used it hard and it keeps on trucking.
I'll be crossing the 250k threshold in a month or so, God willing. I truly wish Mitsubishi was still making these. I'd get another in a heartbeat."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Rick, 04/03/2009,These are awesome!,4,"Hi folks! These Monteros are really great SUVs! They are very stylish. We put 67K miles on ours without a single problem. Their seats are roomy & it is loaded with features. Some Hondas need tranny work, some Toyota engines have sludge issues, some Nissans need frequent sensors, but we have had Mitsubishis since 1983 & they are so trouble-free. The ride was choppy & unnerving though. Power is adequate if you don't tow, but underpowered a bit if you do. Mitsubishi is under appreciated & they build an outstanding vehicle!"
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Grhythm, 07/30/2007,I'll be back!,4,"After all of the fright in 2001 and 2002 over reported SUV roll-overs, I found that Montero received higher than average ratings from the NHTSA tests, which are available on the agency web site.  I was conviced, the commercial hype was not what I should be basing an auto purchase on.  I have never regretted my decision.  The Montero has exceeded my expectations in dependability, durability, comfort, maintenance costs, and safety systems.  Although I've never crashed it, the brakes, lights, suspension and seat belts have given me no unusual issues.  I have been completely satisfied with the truck.  The engine, air conditioning, power roof and entertainment system still perform like new."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Klpm, 12/11/2015,Great for off roading & passenger riding too,4,"This has been a good running car.  Interior comfort is good but 3 row seat is tight for adults but grandkids fit ok.  Love the off road capabilities.  Have taken it places & have never had to use more than high 4.  Gas mileage is not great.  Average 15 miles around town.  Overall look is a little quirky but there is excellent visability all around with no blind spots. Windows appear slightly larger than other SUVs.  Too bad Mitsubishi quick making this model.

mitsubishi,montero,2002,L. Sandoval, 02/09/2009,Montero Limited,4,Bought this Montero brand new. Zero mechanical problems to date. Good first time Japanese car owner experience. I would recommend this truck to anybody looking for a good reliable SUV in this category. Truck has not been to the dealer not even once for repairs or under warranty. Third row seat is good enough for the kids and nephews.
mitsubishi,montero,2002,momof3, 10/15/2009,Love my Montero,4,"I have owned my Montero XLS for 6 years and I have never regretted my purchase.  Today I have 3 kids currently in car seats and my oldest (age 6) sits in the 3rd row.  Because the car seats in the 2nd row stay there permanently I let my son in and out using the rear door which has never been an issue.  I love all the space especially the tall roof.  It is perfect for my husband who is over 6 ft tall.  He borrowed my truck today and as I admired it as it drive off I thought ""Wow-I still love my truck!"" It has 96000 miles on it and I have never had any mechanical problems ever!  It has good pick up, it is a quiet ride, and has tons of storage when the third row is tucked away.  I love it!"
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Shifty, 11/17/2009,For some reason... we love this thing.,4,"It's a lumbering, slow, hulking SUV - therefore, it's everything I should hate to see sitting in my driveway. As die-hard VW owners for many years, we never quite understood the SUV thing but always liked the Monteros we saw on the road. When our second child came along we wanted a vehicle that could carry our entire family plus luggage and/or friends, but it still had to be fun (read: capable off-road). Suddenly the SUV made sense and we bought a Montero. It's been a great truck and we plan on keeping it for years to come.  "

We love the way it drives and it has plenty of power to tow my 4,000 lb. trailer when we go camping.  We looked at plenty of other SUVs, but the used cost of these are so low when compared that you really get a lot of bang for your buck on this.  The bad news for me...my wife gets to drive it most of the time and I'm stuck with our 2dr SUV (though I'm actually in the process of looking for another used Montero to replace the 2dr SUV I have to drive)."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Elizabeth, 10/27/2017,203K miles and still going!,5,"I LOVE this truck! 2002 XLS was purchased with 80k miles on it in 2011. I put 123K miles on this incredible vehicle in 6 years. It may leak oil here and there, but it runs great! Only wear and tear maintenance - Tires, brakes, outer tie rods, alternator, starter, cam seals, valve cover gaskets, and the exhaust so it passes state emissions testing. Its been driven in 115 degree heat index and -20 below 0, it never fails to impress me! I plan to drive this for as long as it will let me! Due to my distance to work I am changing oil every 6 weeks, but this is well worth it! The interior after 15 years still looks brand new, this vehicle in Chicago, IL USA has VERY little rust for being driven several winters with heavy snow/salt on the roads.

mitsubishi,montero,2002,Russ Chadwick, 03/19/2018,What a champion of a vehicle,5,"Incredible vehicle that has taken me on numerous cross country road trips, city drives and a few minor off road adventures. Great visibility, love the giant sun roof, so easy to get and out of, has been through the hot climates of Louisiana and the very cold negative temperatures of North Dakota. The bad side, it does leak oil, which from other reviews sounds like a common problem. I've been awful about trying to fix the leak which has caused it to drip down and require me to replace the starter....twice. Gas mileage isn't amazing for this day in age (at 15ish city and 18ish hwy) but I thought it worth it for the spacious head room and higher profile that's helped me clear over snow and some off roading. This thing is a beast though. I don't take as good of care of my vehicles as I should, had her for 6 years and still going strong.

preferred package and interest rates of 
1.9% for 72 months made this the easy 
financial choice.  200 miles and it's a 
better riding, quieter, and averaging 
better mileage than my Landcruiser.  
landcruiser had 28,000 miles on it, two 
electrical problems and many others 
problems.   This Mitsubishi seems to 
have a better build quality, more 
comfortable, and way more storage with 
the disappearing third seat.  Time will

there but for now I would rate it much 
higher than a Toyota."

worth it.  My brother-in-law has a 
Discovery and my brother has a 
Navigator, both wish they had gotten to 
the Montero before I did.  This is a 
smooth, capable SUV.  I would like to 
dispute the critics that say it doesn't 
handle well. If you want to whip around 
curves and do slalom testing, 
get a Porsche, leave the Montero to 
those of us who were looking for a 
luxury SUV, with distinct styling and 
superior appointments.  And relative to 
the useless third row.  I use it 
often.  True, I have smaller children.  
But if I wanted a bus I would have 
bought an Econline."

It is the most versatile vehicle I have ever owned.  I need a good off road vehicle that is comfortable for my daily commute.  The Montero is awsome off road.  I put around 1,000 off pavement miles on it annually and it kicks butt.  It was born to be driven in dirt, mud, and snow.  It has great storage.  I take the third seat out and use the compartment for storing camping and hunting gear year round.  I can't get rid of it because it still feels new.  My dilema is that they will quit making them after 2006.  I made up my mind that I will always own one, but I guess Mitsubishi messed that up for me."

When shopping for SUVs, I wanted a Suburban but didn't want to pay $40,000. I purchased my Montero with 11,000 miles on it for only $26,000. My wife drove it daily and she never complained about anything with this vehicle. Let me tell you this is very hard to do with my wife. We had a 2000 Grand Cherokee prior to the Montero and it was horrible in comparison. All of the reviews are dead on. If you're looking for speed, don't buy a Montero. If your looking for a reliable SUV that looks a lot more luxurious than the sticker than this is for you. I am thinking about selling it right now, but what other vehicle am I going to get with all of this for $13,000?"

Magically a third seat was produced from out of the floor! I piled all my kids inside and drove around town. I was instantly hooked.

Owner maintenance (light to heavy)  is fairly easy, and new parts & used parts (inp the USA) are readily available: hearsay is several Pacific Rim governments regular rehabbed their fleets of Monty's. Well maintained engine is good for around 300K, and one must properly torque pressures on many fasteners (bolts) . Recommend replacing OEM brake pads & rotor to lower end, Performance parts.  Likewise, change the oil filter regularly due to it's small capacity (my history is using synthetic oil and change the filter at 2K miles, the oil at 4K miles). Intake manifold system is a is a little tricky, oil cap leaks too much  (occasionally fouls the rear O2 sensor). Engine & transfer case replacement is really easy for this vehicle -- (my) 4x4 mechanic gave me a few freebies after the standard engine replacement labor charge.

style.  A *true* 3rd row seat in every 
way.  Styling and luxury of a more 
expensive car."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,jd431we, 08/19/2002,Great SUV,4,"The ride is some what like driving a 
car but you can tell you are in a SUV. 
The Veiw from the drivers see, is great 
you can see every thing. Except for the 
back tire cutting of some of you veiw."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,VicZ, 08/19/2002,a great SUV-best value,4,"The more I drive it, the more I love 
it.  The V6 is powerful and responsive. 
Just forget what editors say about 
the ""not so powerful V6"". My opinion is 
they just wanted to rank it lower than  
Acura MDX and Landcruiser based on 
sales numbers.  The truth is the V6 is 
more than adequate.  Montero is for 
smart people who can make an educated 
decision, who know what true value and 
what a practical SUV is. It's not for 
dumb people who know nothing other than 
Honda or Toyota. The third seat is 
usable, the ride is comfortable(kinda 
firm ).It doesn't lean much going 
around corners. It's an excellent 
alternative to minivans."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Afrikaner, 08/27/2002,Vaue for money,4,"good vehicle, compared well to other 
mid size suv's. Interior best of all

mitsubishi,montero,2002,Margot , 08/29/2002,Like the Montero Sport Lmtd AWD,4,"Had mine since June. It's done great 
and worked for every need we've had 
so far--big trips, urban commutes, 
hauling kayaks, plants, groceries, 
pets. Only wish is for better gas 
mileage, which holds for any midsize 
or larger SUV."

mitsubishi,montero,2002,BigRed1, 09/22/2002,Very Nice True Off-Road Vehicle,4,"No problem at all with stability or 
power issues.  As nice as it looks, 
this is a real off-road vehicle, not an 
enlarged 'autobahn' sportscar like the 
X5. The steering and braking systems 
are a true pleasure to use, along with 
the Sportronic gear shifter.  The field-
of-view is outstanding.  Unbelievably 
roomy for passengers in back(forget 
that 3rd row seat, use the space for 
lots of gear).  Fog lights and big 
windows work great in low visiblity 
conditions."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,BrendanCoote, 09/27/2002,Greatest SUV,4,"I live in Dubai, seconds away from 
great wadi's, desert Dunes and other 
fantastic off road scenario's. Self 
and friends frequently take our motors 
through the ropes in the desert. 
Without doubt the most capable car is 
mine (called a Pajero in this neck of 
the woods) versus Wranglers, 
Cherokee's, land cruisers and Patrols. 
I love it. Only issues would be some 
of the exterior frame is a little 
flimsey (My second trip in the car saw 
it limping home with a tailgate 
hanging off and a decapitated front 
fender. I love the car"
mitsubishi,montero,2002,park, 11/02/2002,simply the best,5,"I never thought this SUV was this 
great, but this car is simply the best. 
I had eclipse previously, and I didn't 
have any problem with the car, so I 
decided to go with mitsu one more time. 
before buying this suv, I test drove 
2003 toyo 4 runner, 2003 nissan 
pathfinder, and none of them can really 
match with montero. Engine is powerful 
enough, and I am not gonna race with 
this car, so I don't need more power. I 
love everything about this car."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,sam ash, 11/08/2002,New Fun,4,"Feels the quality of the truck. Great 
customer service at the dealership and

give more feed back as i drive it more."

and really only ended up at the 
Bigger's Mitsubishi for the cool FREE

to seal the deal on the CD, we looked 
at the Montero Limited and two hours

were sold on the room for the money!"

mitsubishi,montero,2002,sailing216, 02/03/2003,Great Vehicle,4,"We bought it 8 months used and we got 
a deal, 23k for a LTD.  36k miles

new Pilot(boring), MDX (pay sticker), 
Explorer (not sold on reliability). 
3rd seat is great, sunroof is AWSOME, 
interior is second only to the 50k+ 
Landcruiser.  It's heavier and bigger, 
but will keep up with the Pilot/MDX 
accelerating.  Really surprised by the 
great Ride, was expecting Truck.  
Reliability has been flawless and 
handling has impoved with different

mitsubishi,montero,2002,Todd2, 10/23/2003,My first foreign buy,4,"Great truck.  Would buy again, and 
really like the rate/incentives thru 
Mitsu Motors.  Distinct style going 
down the road.  Great climate controls 
cruise and stereo.  Needs a little more 
front leg room.  Interior trim on doors 
and seats coming off and loose.  Love 
the hiding third row seat (don't use it 
much anyway).  Needs a V-8.  Oil change 
is very difficult."

mitsubishi,montero,2002,Ali family, 11/09/2003,Cool Car,4,"We bought our car a month ago, We were 
looking for a lincoln Navigator or a

third row seat for the kids(kids love 
it), Roomy second row seat, infinite 
steroe and Magnificent exterior and 
iterior appearence."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Rodney, 01/08/2006,Wish I Had It Back,4,"I purchased the Mitsubishi Montero Limited.  The interior was very quiet and the ride was the smootest I have seen, except the Lexus LX 470 but at $30,000 with the price difference I chose the Monterro. I never regreted it. I recently replaced it with a  2004 Ford Freestar. It is a good van but it is no Montero. My wife and I really enjoyed it and plan to purchase a new one in the near future."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Diane Literski, 03/02/2004,"Montaro Ltd world rated #1SUV, USA#?",4," Purchased due to world 
acclaim (known less in USA). In 
Europe & Australia rated Overall Best 
Large 
4WD for performance, quality, 
safety and value. Toyota/Lexus 2nd, 
Mercedes ML320 3rd. First lge SUV 
with indep. rear suspension. Won Paris-
Dakar rally the last few years. Not 
liking big vehicles -needed one for the 
family, this large vehicle handles as 
if much smaller- more like a car than
SUV. Transmission as smooth as the 525i 
BMW previously owned. Good performance 
(V6). Fuel consumption good for size - 
a real 
15-17 mpg (city). Build quality very 
good. Dash a little plain. After 36,000

this vehicle, is is my second Montero."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,lfp, 03/04/2002,2002 Mitsubishi Montero,4,"This vehicle is much bigger and alot nicer than the 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited that I traded in. It has a unibody frame, just like the Jeep,but the interior is roomier and I like the rear seats that are fold-away. I just can't say enough about this vehicle, it's fun to drive, luxurious and the exterior body is an eye catcher. It just needs a beefier V6 engine or a V8. But overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and the 0% interest rate is an added bonus."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Jen & Mike, 04/10/2003,We Love Our Montero,5,"We were leaning towards a Ford Escort, 
Honda Pilot or Toyota 4Runner when we 
bought the Montero. Went with the 
Montero due to the great price & 
financing and couldn't be happier. It's 
super comfortable inside & has tons of 
convenient cargo room. The rear seat is 
small, but we just about never use that 
for seating anyway. We've been skiing, 
offroading, and driving on the pitted 
streets of Philadelphia and we've had 
no problems so far.  Plus, when we got 
pummeled with 2 feet of snow this 
winter, we had no parking problems 
since the Montero scaled huge mounds of 
snow with ease."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,South Tex, 04/18/2003,Wifey had to have it,4,"Now I just love it too. 14 months of 
pure bliss. We thought we wanted a 
Sequoia, but we drove this home because 
we LIKED IT BETTER and it was 
considerably less. I find the thrid row 
seating fine for our infrequent use. 
THe styling sets it apart from 
everything else on the road. I just 
love the thing. Wish it got a little 
better milage."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,emejia, 01/15/2003,A Short Review of XLT w/touring package,4,"Purchased to replace a Toyota T-100.

mitsubishi,montero,2002,cdub, 03/11/2002,Love it,4,"We were about to throw our hat into the MDX sweepstakes but could not stomach the extra five grand (as well as the yupster appeal)  Except for gas mileage, could not have made a better decision. Solid in snow and rain, nice ride, ton of space, very nice interior elements, intuitive gauges, great seats, nice stereo and 0% financing closed the deal. Take a very hard look at look at what you get for the $$ when you compare to Explorer Eddie Bauer and Envoy)"
mitsubishi,montero,2002,wallace, 01/18/2003,David's Montero,4,"Excellent vehicle, fun to drive. 4WD is 
excellent in rainy conditions. Sunroof 
is excellent. Turning radius excellent 
for an SUV 3rd row seats comfortable and 
well designed. Stow away feature very 
easy to use and efficient.

Only negative is gas milage. I think 
first gear is too low and doesn't shift 
soon enough. Overdrive should be set to 
allow lower RPM on Interstate use. 

Overall though, an absolutely wonderful 
vehicle with distinctive styling that 
sets it apart from the sea of Tahoes, 
Sequoia, Expeditions, etc. "

mitsubishi,montero,2002,forno1special, 03/18/2002,frank & gisel's review,4,"we feel this is one SUV that people have not taken the time to go see otherwise there would be more of them on the road its got sportronic transmision on the fly AWD plus 4HL,4LL exelent turning radius seating for seven electric seats trip computer w/digital compas the list goes on in other words with a few more ponies and a GPS it would be the perfect SUV."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,fiveover, 03/21/2002,Dare to Compare,4,My wife and I purchased our new 2002 Montero XLS with Touring Package and rear A/C a week ago and are very happy with it.  We have 2 young boys and there is abundant room for everything.  We haven't been off-road with it yet (trip planned in April) but according to other reviews this is where the Montero shines.  We compared it to other vehicles in its class and I don't think there is any comparison.  I think most people have a hard time accepting the radical exterior styling but that's one of the many things we love about it.
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Dennis , 03/23/2002,After 2 months of shopping around,4,"Very nice interior. Excellent paint job ( I got a blue montero Ltd.). Huge sunroof.  Very comfy front seats. Feets in my garage ( same size as wife's  Nissan Maxima)  Good sound system.  Foog lights work realy good. Good visability.  0-0-0 financing for a year  have sealed my deal. I have bought it for $300 over  invoice after 2 weeks of negotiating ( however paid $500 for running boards) Good acceleration for SUV (you dont expect it to accelerate like a spot's car ... do you?)

One more thing - you dont see it on every corner like  some of the ""cute looking SUVs""."
mitsubishi,montero,2002,phonos, 03/25/2002,One of the last real off-road SUVs,4,"Great off-road, much better handling and confort than my 1986 3/4 ton 4x4 Suburban.   Wife even like to drive it.

Beat out Land-Cruiser in one Austrailal off-road review"
mitsubishi,montero,2002,Guizer69, 03/26/2002,2001 Montero,4,I believe this is an excellent ride. These reports about fliping over is totaly rediculas.
mitsubishi,montero,2002,gparkjr, 04/02/2002,Initial feelings,3,"Very pleased thus far.  All the amenities I ever wanted.  Went through 3 dealers for the Limited and none would come close to the invoice price posted at Edmunds.  Do not know how feasable it is to get invoice price.  Power leaves something to be desired, but love everything else on the vehicle.  Comparing to other like models, I feel this is the best deal."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Brian, 02/04/2016,"Only owner, now 160,000 and still going strong!",5,"May not be the ""best looking"" SUVs on the road, but definitely excellent in dependability. I bought mines new in 2003 only because of an end of the year savings, which absorbed the negative equity of my “lemon” trade in. I wanted a SUV but knew nothing about this particular make/model. I didn’t even know what it looked like until they walked me over to it. Initially I was not impressed. Although leather seats, I thought the interior was cheaply designed, and it was a little noisy at higher speeds. As stated, I bought, but thought I would most likely get rid of it around 3yrs/30k. However, here I still own it over 13 years later, and I wouldn’t get rid of my baby for nothing! The only repairs I made to her are changing the oxygen sensors multiple times, a minor adjustment to my four wheel drive, and engine oil seals. Granted, I have stayed on top of the scheduled maintenance. Unfortunately, Mitsubishi no longer makes this model. However, they should bring it back with interior, and body style upgrades. I would certainly buy another!

mitsubishi,montero,2003,Mainer, 03/30/2005,2003 Ltd 20th Anniversary Montero,5,"We purchased our 2003 Ltd 20th Anniversary Montero used and absolutely love it.  We live in Maine and it dealt with the 100+ inches of snow we got this winter beautifully.  I can't believe the ""experts"" only rate it at a 5.6.  It has a lot power and drives and looks great.  It is always being favorably commented on by others.  We test drove Envoys, Trailblazers, etc. and they couldn't compare to the room and build quality of the Montero.  It has a ton of cargo room and the third row seating option is great for short distance dinner trips with 2 other couples.  We couldn't be more pleased with our Montero and for 10-15K less than our friend's Lexus, it's a steal.  Even the Lexus owner agrees!"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,mjd11, 09/15/2011,"248,582 original miles and still going strong!!!",4,"i bought my 2003 montero LTD in 2004 with 25,000 miles and since 200,000 + miles in the odometer and let me tell it has never let me stranded no where! only do the regular basic maintenance (oil, oil filter,air filter,battery,brakes, etc) and the off road capability one of the best off road vehicle you can buy.But where it falls short is in horseporwer is slugish when accelerating and the mpg i think can be improve im getting max and light footed on highway speed is 19.1.but overall is the most reliable (and i have had toyotas)and comfortable ,i would recommended it to everybody."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Bryan Calnton, 11/21/2008,"120k+, It keeps going and...",4,"I drive a steep and curvy mountain every day. At first I was a bit disappointed in the handling. I replaced the tires from the dealer and WOW! What a difference. I end up passing motorcycles over the mountain. (Do not try that at home.) It handles very well for a SUV. The gas mileage for what I put it through is great 17 mpg. I am a contractor, one day I pulled a tandem dump truck out of a steep driveway on one of my job sites. Saved me a wrecker bill. It was in 2LLC slow going but it did the job. I am so proud to own this Montero. Edmunds.com take another Montero out for a test drive, I guarantee if you change the tires you will change your mind."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Gino 3, 11/18/2009,Head Turner,5,"I have had a Montero Limited for 5 yrs and I love it. I actually preferred my montero over my Dad's Hummer H2 when he asked me which one I would prefer to have. I love the interior's quality and comfort. It does great off-roading with a rock solid frame. Has a good take off for an SUV of its size. Everywhere I go it always turns head and people are always asking what kinda of car it is and most even think it's an 08 or 09 model. Great sound system for being stock, I wish it would have the fourth generations 650 watt Rockford Fosgate system with a 10"" sub with 12 speakers and 240hp MIVEC engine though, but it will do. I would never choose any other SUV over my Montero besides the H1 alpha."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Chuck , 11/05/2002,Sturdy SUV,4,"I sold my 89 with 197,000 to a 
salesman. For the $ I think the ML 
series should be a comparable truck as 
well. I got a blk/blk leather fully 
loaded for under 40k (well under). It 
has a new 3.8l engine not the 3.5 that 
came in the 02's. The truck has plenty 
of pick-up. With all the standard 
equipment I ruled out the ML and QX4 
easily. Everyone loves it."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,tilolite, 08/18/2010,Best Bang for your recessionary buck,4,"I bought the 03 Montero 20th Anniv used for a much less than similarly loaded or capable SUV. I already own a 98 Montero Sport with over 155k mi which is still running great.  I expect the same or better from this one.  I was attracted to Montero's rally heritage, bullet proof engine and that I grew up with them in the Caribbean where they are known as Pajero. Although 7 yrs old, this SUV still turns heads since it is fairly rare.  It goes anywhere in style. It's reliable, comfortable and cheap to buy especially used leaving me with money for new mods. I have added wheel spacers for improve stability and look. Next I will add larger rims & tires, a cold air intake to increase HP and MPG."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Nick, 06/17/2009,Fun to Drive Monty,4,"I used to own a Honda Mini Van but wanted to upgrade to an SUV. With lots of research work, I kept coming back to Montero Limited. The Price/Feature combo sold me a 5k mile driven SUV for a huge discount. It's a dark midnight blue with black leather interior. It currently has 85k miles. Besides regular oil/filter changes, I performed a major scheduled maintenance at 60K. Flushed fluids thru dealer, changed front/rear axle oil and spark plugs (DIY). Changed front brake pads at 40k interval and rear brakes once so far. A very reliable truck/SUV with no problems at all as long as you use genuine parts and keep up with maintenance. Planning on driving it up to 300k miles."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,the potts, 07/14/2005,2003 Montero Limited,4,"We are so pleased with this vehicle, had to share the experience for future buyers contemplating the Montero.  Jeep Cherokee and Infiniti's were our comparison vehicles before finding the Montero.  Once we drove the Montero, the others paled in comparison both in price and style.  Third row seating is a super feature and used more than we would have expected.  No lack of power and the shift of gears in auto mode is remarkably smooth."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,hh 589 , 08/29/2008,Awesome SUV!,4,"I loved the build quality and interior at the time of purchase. A bit of remorse set in over the first year due to ""road wildness"" - read comments on the internet and found out I needed to change the ""OEM"" tires - changed to Michelin LTS and man what a difference - now I love everything about this vehicle - I now have 97,000 miles and have not had any major problems - agile , rock solid and extremely comfortable in and out , best visibility . My partner is on his third company car and I have still stayed in this one even though the company would buy me anything I want - nothing out there that interests me . "

mitsubishi,montero,2003,val, 02/23/2006,What a blast,5,"We checked out all the SUV's on the market. We were tired of seeing the same ones on the road, so we checked out the Mitsubushi Montero. At first we didn't like the full size, but fell in love with it after we drove it. My husband is long waisted. The Montero has tons of headroom and legroom in the front and back. The back door opens and closes like a car door - we'll never hassle with a hatch opening again.  Our friends & family are sold on it as well.  The back seats fold down for lots of storage.  The 3rd row seat is handy for kids. Its gas mileage is decent.  It is not cavernous like the Chevrolet Trailblazer though.  It has good visibility. It is better looking than the ""dog"" Durango, but not as expensive as the Toyota Land Cruiser.  One bad thing about this truck is that we have spent thousands of dollars on regular maintenance. We'll consider that next time."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Dwayne Roberts, 09/05/2003,DO'S AND DON'TS,4,"This is my first full size Montero, 
two others before were sports. This 
vehicle is all around a nicer vehicle 
with better quality materials used in 
it. I have the 2003 and I can see it 
is clear that many poeople reviewing 
this car as Mitsubishi sales people. I 
guess you can't weed them out. Nice 
car but not the right one for me. 
Mitsubishi was also horrible to deal 
with through the whole. Had no care 
that I already had two previous. Never 
again will I deal with them."

 With new engine runs great but now the drive train needs to be replaced.  Took very good care of this Montero, not sure why this all happened.
Not only that but had to replace alternator 3 times prior to finding out about the rings going bad.
Drove the Montero from Washington to Mississippi, not one problem!

mitsubishi,montero,2003,Denise`, 11/21/2002,Not Just For The Dogs,4,"After looking to replace my Ford 
Explorer with another I just wasn't 
sold.  Having three large dogs was a 
consideration as was having to drive 
clients.  Unlike my previous SUVs I can 
fold down the seats to create the dog 
barrier; no more of those bulky fences, 
and the dogs can be closer to front 
seat passengers.  The interior is 
classy and has drawn many a compliment, 
even from a pal who'd recently 
purchased the Benz SUV.  Handles like a 
dream in rain and snow; I ski so it's 
been put to the test.  We haul our 
motorcycle trailer with it and it 
doesn't slow us down a bit.  Oh, did I 
mention the extra large sunroof..."

mitsubishi,montero,2003,Fred Reithel, 04/22/2008,Excellent vehicle,4,"We have owned three Montero's, two new, one bought as a lease return. Other than the SUV type of gas mileage they have been terrific vehicles, great comfort, quality build and enjoying to own. Mitsubishi makes fine product and we will consider the next generation of smaller Mitsu SUV's when the time comes.  Buy used with confidence"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,dplumley, 05/01/2003,More than esctatic,4,"After testing about 10 SUVs (and no 
worthy candidates for purchase in 
sight), I was immediately hooked on 
the Montero Limited.  After owning it 
for 5 months, I love it even more than 
the day I drove it off the lot!  It 
drives as smooth and fun as it looks, 
and is also as tough and well 
engineered as it looks (tested this in 
a serious collision - I walked away 
without a scratch thanks to the 
excellent impact absorbtion design).  
I have no idea why reviews of this 
vehicle are poor.  I already plan, in 
12 years, to trade this one in for 
whatever Montero Limited exists at 
that time.  I only hope the price is 
as good then as it is now!!!!  "

like a GPS system and better gas 
mileage."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Doug Lieberman, 09/05/2003,Think Twice,3,"This vehicle is nice but still needs 
work. Big Sunroof and nice color 
choices."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Fairlane500_1957, 11/07/2002,Montero miles,4,"With less then 1,000 miles on my new 
Montero I feel I have a few things to 
point out. I like the way this vehicle 
handles tight turning radius, firm 
ride, good power. I'm anxious to see 
how it does pulling my camper. It's 
rated for 5,000 pounds towing and my 
camper only weighs 2,200 so it should 
pull it with ease. But we'll see when 
we hit the mountains. That's the only 
concern that I had was the V-6 having 
the power I needed."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,barracuda, 11/15/2002,the best of the best,4,"you can do anything with this vehicle 
except dive in the sea"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,eric287, 12/12/2002,so far so great,4,"Bought our Limited with the premium pgk 
just a couple weeks ago.  So far we 
love it.  We shopped and shopped and 
then shopped some more.  Came down to 
this and the Pilot.  This was a few 
grand more, and I know the Honda will 
have better resale, but its styling was 
so dull and boring; both inside and out 
in our opinion.  (A little more pizzaz, 
and Honda would have had us as 
customers I think.) Plus the Montero is 
a much more luxurious vehicle."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,EdwardTN, 01/21/2003,Love My New Montero,4,"Looked at lots of SUV's and chose the 
Montero for all of the standard 
features that seem 
to be options on the others...which 
made the price tag very comparable. I 
got the XLS with the touring package. 
I live on a mountain and the Montero 
performed unbelievably during a recent 
snowstorm. I literally drove straight 
up the mountain around stuck cars and 
trucks as if there was no snow at all. 
The infinity sound system sounds great 
and the sunroof is HUGE! I especially 
like the 'escaine' seating surfaces, 
whch can best be described as 
perforated suede. I will update my 
review, but so far I woould definately 
recommend this vehicle to anyone."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,ABS, 01/22/2003,Bang for the buck,5,"After driving the Montero my choice was 
clear, and I was spotted that day!  My 
trade was dying and I needed an SUV 
fast.  When the salesman showed me the 
fold into a bed seats it blew my mind! 
If Mitsubishi would advertise it more I 
know it would be a top seller."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Beetle, 02/10/2003,"Unique, Fun SUV",4,"This is my 3rd Montero. Also owned an 89
and a 94. Quality and Confort are great.
New larger 3.7 litre engine is a big
improvement. This is a HEAVY vehicle you
feel safe in. Had it for about 4 weeks -
and i'm not disappointed. A quality built
and unique looking SUV."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,markatz, 02/11/2003,My Fourth Montero,4,"I have had 4 Monteros, the last one is 
a 2003 Limited.  I have never had any 
work done except oil and filters.  Two 
warranty recalls done while I waited. 
We drive on the road 6,000 miles yearly 
and leave our Cadillac CTS at home. A 
great road car."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,corcione, 02/18/2003,A Good Choice,4,"Powerful and sturdy.  The heavy weight 
and wide track keeps the vehical glued 
to the road.

Rear spare tire sticks out further 
than the bumper, which makes it 
vulnerable to even a slow 5 to 10 MPH 
bumper bash.  This vulnerability could 
cause major damage to the rear door 
even at slow speeds.

Over all a great choice.  However, all 
SUV's are over priced and that is the 
fault of customer demand.  If 
customers were not willing to the pay 
big bucks, then prices would be lower."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Dubb28, 02/21/2003,Montero,4,"My wife and I were initially loking at 
Tahoe, Expedition, Denali, Navigator. 
Tested the Limited fell in love. Mitsu 
sales/service outstanding. Got a 
fabolous deal on new '02. Features 
match the top of line SUV with a better 
price. Plenty of room, handles great, 
and can be taken everywhere from 
shopping, to the park, to off roading 
and camping to a night on town."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,LaBelle, 07/26/2003,Happy,5,"When looking for an suv...we looked at
many models...and after trying out several  
different makes...we were most happy
with the over-all appearance and
performance.
I would buy another one tomorrow!"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Rolando Espejo, 02/27/2003,Trade for this SUV now!,4,"The interest rate is what drew us into 
purchasing this. 3.9% APR Simple 
Interest loan for 72 months! 
But it is an awesome SUV with off-
roading heritage not other makes can 
claim. It is made in Japan so assembly 
is tops. Very solid. No annoying 
creaks from vibrating parts. Very 
handsome looking."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,PHOnos, 08/26/2003,2003 20th Annversary Special,4,"Had a 2001 LTD.  Loved it.  55,000 
miles and decided to trade for a new 
one with 0.0% financing.  Hope this one 
is as reliable and as good off road as 
the 2001.

The 2001 had LSD in the rear.  Hope the 
new traction system works as well.

I changed out the springs and shocks to 
ARB OMEs and the tires to BFG AT KOs in 
265-75 x 16  Improved the handling but 
ride more like a truck."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,lxc, 08/13/2003,Love my limited montero - great for moms,4," 
 I really appreciate that I can
stow the rear seat under the floor and
gain that cargo space  And I love being
able to expand seating capacity so easy.
 I totally disagree that the rear seat
is useless My kids love it  Lets face it
Im not going to drive cross country with
an adult back there but who would  The
seats flip very easily to get the kids
in and out
Its great on the highway and around town
 And its not so big that I need a
flagger to get me into a parking space 
  Its great for lugging the kids their
stuff and friends around and looks great
 not the mother ship (aka minivan) and
its not like driving a grayhound (Giant SUV)"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Miko, 09/21/2003,Love my Montero,4,"When we were looking for a family 
vehicle we were testing Minivans and 
had decided to get a Honda however we 
fell in love with the Montero.  I feel 
that this SUV rides more like a car 
than other SUV's we've tested ie: the 
Pilot, CR-V and Endeavor. If you have 
older kids this was a better fit.  
There is lots of room in the front and 
second seat.  The third row seat meant 
for two additional passengers is really 
poorly designed, my ten year old has a 
hard time.  It is really comfortable 
when we travel with the family. There 
is plenty of room for bags and luggage. 
Overall we really love this SUV."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Stephen R, 09/22/2003,Fun to Drive,4,"This has been my first SUV's and after 
lookng at several this one suited my 
needs in terms of having a good amount 
of space and not spending the money 
for an Escalade or Navigator. It is a 
very comftorable ride and isn't as bad 
on gas as some other larger SUV's. I 
am a little dissapointed in the 
overall handling for highway driving 
and I think they could improve the 3rd 
row seating."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,hanse, 09/23/2003,understated,5,"good better best suv that ive driven

but its not true"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,babs62202, 09/25/2003,Great Purchase,4,"We test drove several SUVs (including: 
Mercedes, Volvo, the new VW) when we 
were looking for a new SUV.  No other 
SUV maker had the options that 
Mitsubishi had.  All were compareable 
on gas milage.  But the Montero had the 
fold down 3rd row seats (they don't get 
in the way like the Mercedes), nice 
interior features (I love that the 
front row armrest adjusts to the driver 
and it looks better then Volvo), and 
4wd standard.  I wouldn't change my 
choice.  Also I had a great dealership 
to work with."

accident where I was rear-ended my back 
was to sensative and not too many SUV's 
seats would make me comfortable. I sat 
and test drove many SUV's in mid-/high- 
30K's range and none of them could make 
comfortable a 6'2"" man. The only one 
that I like was a Toyota Landcruiser 
those seat were perfect but price of 
$58K quickly spook me away. Mitsubishi 
delear was extremely sweet and I was 
able to get a loaded Montero Ltd with

approximatelly 2 months since I own my 
Montero and I am completely satisfied."

(about 15 degree incline) in snowy or 
icy or slushy conditions, and that's 
why I bought it in the first place!  
At first, I thought the problem was 
the inferior all-seasons that it was 
sold with, so this year, I bought 
super-rugged Mastercraft Courser C/Ts, 
and my Mitsu STILL can't climb my 
drive (yes, we have already our first 
snow storm).  No one can figure out 
why - someone please help me if you 
can. I'm disappointed, as the 2002 
Dodge Ram climbs my drive with no

everything we have asked it to do.  I 
have been a reader of Consumer Reports

The exterior styling is attractive and the interior is just plain beautiful with high quality materials and design layout.  It will haul a ton of gear with the back seats down and go almost anywhere.  I am pleased with the acceleration, braking, handling and fuel economy (about 21 mpg on long trips).  Check it on Edmunds.com against the other 2003 competition, like the Ford Explorer, Dodge Durango, Chevy (any of their SUVs), Nissan Pathfinder and even Toyota 4Runner.

When the long-legged teenage boys didn't complain about leg room and say ""are we there yet"" while driving in it, I knew it was the next vehicle for me.  In 2003, I purchased the 20th Anniversary Edition and have not regretted it.  I get better gas mileage than the sticker that was on it said I would.  My co-workers love to have me drive for lunches as they have so much room.  Due to my lower back problems, many of the SUV's were too bouncy for me.

great sunroof, killer A/C, nice

and love it.  looked at all and kept 
coming back (i also own a 95 monty).  
you should know that the land cruiser, 
range rover, and monty were made to be 
suv's.  all others are built on truck 
(sequoia, yukon, explorer) or van 
chasis (pilot, highlander).  if you 
want a true suv and cash left over, 
consider the montero, its tough but 
still drives like a ""true"" suv should. 
outstanding 4 wheel drive system--have 
4 settings to choose from and can drive 
in 2wd until i need 4wd. this saves 
fuel comsumption. don't know why 
the ""experts"" are down on the monty,

my 95)."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Winston, 02/21/2005,Monty Number 3,4,"It is funny how Montero owners tend to be fanatics about their trucks.  It is also strange when reading complaints from ""experts.""  Anyway, I love this truck.  Not too big, not too small,  Beautifull Interior, awesome stereo. Enough power for me.  True truck but still has a great ride because of unibody construction and 4 wheel independant construction.  Overpriced when new, unless you get a big discount.  Funny thing, like the other reviewer I have '95 which has been incredibley reliable and is a big reason why I purchased a new one."

purchasing a Suburban or Expedition.  
For thoroughness we decided to test 
drive a Montero.  The refined styling, 
smooth performance and excellent 
visibility were instantly apparent.  We 
have been pleased with our purchase.  
The Montero handles well in the 
ice/snow, has adequate power to get up 
to the Mountains for skiing and has 
good cargo capacity without being 
overly bulky like a Suburban.  This 
vehicle feels like a Toyota Landcruiser 
for $25K less."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Pacebomber, 07/31/2005,Great SUV,4,"Bought a while back, needed to upgrade to something with a 3rd seat, my Isuzu Trooper just couldn't fit everyone.  After looking at may domestic and foreign SUVs the Montero won hands down.  Edmunds needs to lighten up on the lack of power, it does everything I need it to do.  If you have a really heavy whatever to tow then you might want a V8, but I'm guessing all the V8 owners are rethinking things with the gas prices the way they are."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,David Michielin, 03/05/2006,Mitsubishi Monterto 2003,4,"The 2003 Mitsubishi Montero drives well.  My wife finds the vehicle very easy to drive and park.  I particularly like its turning radius, it should be a police chase car. I'm also very impressed with torque the engine puts out, but it does come at a price for fuel. The vehicle is still relatively new and I hope I can get better mileage on a tank of gas. The seats for the 6th and 7th passengers at the back are relatively cramped for an adult but fine for my 7 and 10 year olds and their friends.The sunroof is large, which is great in the summer time."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,East bay area owner, 08/27/2006,Off-road champ that goes to the Opera,4,The Mitsubishi Montero is an awesome off-road vehicle!  I went to Hollister Hills SVRA and owned it!  It beat all of the other trucks out there. I washed it up and went to San Francisco to blend in with all the snobby folks out there.
mitsubishi,montero,2003,savannah1, 04/01/2003,i like the montero,4,"this is my second montero ltd.  i just 
turned in my 2001 - made some sense 
with the financing deals and i was 
eager to get the larger engine.  the 
3.8 is a big difference"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,miss salgado, 04/12/2003,wow what a ride,5,"I came in and though to my self ""It 
looks like a tank"" but when I got in 
it I though wow its a palace. I havent 
had it to long but I feel confertable 
in it and it feels like the truck 
ajusted to me not the other way 
around."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,madsforu, 04/15/2003,awesome vehicle,4,"I have had the ""Monte Boy"" as my wife 
calls it for 3 full years, picked up 
the 2001 Limited edition, finished 
50000 miles in every possible road 
condition, snow, desert, mountain, 
slush, u name it. It has been one great 
vehicle with no major repairs of 
problems so far, it stands out as far 
as looks go , the only thing I feel sad 
about it is it gets poor review from 
the so called Automobile experts but 
the customers always rate it as 
excellent!"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,dcmooreesq, 04/19/2007,Good bang for the buck,4,"Bought my 2003 Montero used (driven 1 year), so took advantage of a great price cut.  Was in virtually new condition.  Well put together, workmanship is very good.  Runs great.  V6 has adequate power for me, I don't tow.  Fuel economy is okay for an SUV.  Very reliable and roomy.  I rarely go offroad, but this thing is one of the more capable stock 4x4s.  Handles snow and dirt just fine.  The Infinity radio system is okay.  Controls and gauges are well laid out.  For what I paid, I'm very happy.  Too bad Mitsu has decided to stop selling the Monty in the US. "
mitsubishi,montero,2003,John G, 07/06/2007,Great SUV!! Best Exterior Design!,4,"I love my Montero XLS! Unbeatable exterior design and its attractive and practical on the inside too. Engine is powerful for a 3.8L V6 and the self-select 4WD has 4 settings for different driving conditions. Very comfortable and solid ride. Awesome sounds system and 3rd row seat. Good value versus the competition. I chose the Montero over the Pilot and 4Runner because of its styling, true 4WD feature and overall quality and value for money."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,George, 08/15/2007,Tough Comfortable Odd looking Suv,4,"I'm really impressed with  the off-road capablities of this vehicle, if not for somewhat low clearances, this truck could be unstoppable.  I've taken it places my friends have feared to tread, (pathfinder)  just in it's stock form. The gas mileage is unimpressive,  though from its size it's expected. Plus it was so cheap I can afford to have fun with it."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,mdp, 06/20/2007,Built for ME!,4,"This SUV is the most fun auto I've ever owned!  I love the interior styling and comfort.  People ask me about it all the time.  I tell them I'd rather have this than spend 80k  for a  few more bells and whistles on a Lexus, it's just as nice inside! It has plenty of pep and I have hauled trailers full of stuff.   "
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Todd, 11/12/2007,"Hands down, the best 4x4 for the money",4,"Just bought a 2003 20th Anniversary Ed. Love it! This thing will get you anywhere and in style too. At a time when luxury SUVs are everywhere, the Montero will still turn heads and boast serious off-road capabilities. All this at half or less than luxury SUV's above it's class."

On short trips and long, I have had zero problems with this vehicle. I have not done anything except routine maintanence tires oil changes wipers. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. The Montero is rock solid. I wish I would have purchased it years sooner "

Montero Sport lease not intending to 
get another Mitsubishi until I sat in 
and drove the 2003 Montero.  It is a 
solid, luxury ride with a beautiful 
interior, ample pick-up, easy 
handling, and a nicely updated 
exterior.  Everyone who gets in my car 
can't stop raving, and I love driving 
it.  There is plenty of interior room 
for my family and my work samples and 
the seats adjust easily to make more 
space.  Try one out - you'll love it!"
mitsubishi,montero,2003,Bob Bonville, 01/23/2003,Back to Back Monteros.,4,"Great vehicle overall. Its my second 
Mitsubishi that I have purchased new 
back to back. The first one was a 1998 
Montero Sport. Had a good experiance 
with it so I bought another one."

suv to do. it,s easy to drive for my

it for not only looks, but for 
convience for using for work, such as 
getting items in and out of the suv is 
not to big or to small it is just right."
mitsubishi,montero,2003,rkuch, 04/30/2003,ML430 Vs Montero,4,"I have both a Mercedes ML430 and the 
2003 Montero. The interior of the 
Montero is just as nice, if not better 
than the Mercedes. I like the third 
row seating and wood trim on the 
Montero. The area of view is better in 
the Montero and it has much more 
interior room. A great buy for the 
money so far. "
mitsubishi,montero,2003,DWHOUSES, 03/11/2008,Will miss Monteros,4,"This is my 4th Montero. I take them to about 150,000 miles & get another one. They are bulletproof, luxurious, reasonably economical (I get a solid 18 MPG) and distinctive looking. I will be ready for another in 2008 and am devasted that they aren't made any more. I can't think of any other SUV that provided the space, quality, comfort and style for anywhere near the price. Its a LandCruiser for 2/3rds the price."

little spongy on the highway."

family car. If you are looking for a 
nice confortable suv which is fun to 
drive and is a nice family car then 
this is the car for you. From its 
infinity sound system to its leather 
seats(if you choose leather)it is one 
of the best suv's i have ever drivin. "
mitsubishi,montero,2003,03 Montero Review..I own. , 07/15/2020,Montero's are awseome!!!,5,"Bought my 03 mitsu at 157,000 miles. Put some money into it. Drives great and smooth. Replaced egr valve today for fun, mass air flow sensor, coils, spark plug etc. She passed smog a while ago. Next one coming. Love this SUV, put Falcon off road tires on her and looks fantastic. Bought for $3000. I bought Bertha for running my Doberman pincher, she was tearing up my Toyota Tacoma...brand new. Drives great. Catalytic converters are getting harder to find. 
"
mitsubishi,montero,2004,SafeInSnow, 01/31/2010,Mountain Climber,5,"My wife and I call this the Mountain Climber. It's ability to grip the road in all conditions (snow, sleet, rain, mud) is amazing.  I really wish they would make a 2010 version.  Compared w/ all other SUV's, this is the hidden diamond (get it?).  3 rows of seating, HUGE storage, and awesome cabin feel."
mitsubishi,montero,2004,2 Time Montero Owner, 12/11/2004,hope this helps someone,4,"The things that keeps me from selling 
my montero with fuel prices on the rise 
is that it is awesome to drive, handles 
great, great driving visibility which 
makes me feel a lot safer driving in 
different types of conditions, 
comfortable driving on freeway or on a 
dirt road, and is as easy to park as a 
car. I'm not afraid to be a little 
rough on my montero because I know it 
can take it. Very cold A/C, lots of 
headroom, turns and handles like a car, 
high ground clearance. Downfalls are 
that the 3rd row seats are not intended 
for adults, is hard to wash, and carpet 
length is hard to vacuum. The good 
things still outweigh the bad. It is an 
awesome driving suv."
mitsubishi,montero,2004,Vicvizual, 05/26/2008,3rd Montero,5,"Why is this my third Montero ?? I've been around many vehicles and cannot find a better bang for my bucks, and great quality and reliability are by far its greatest features.  I have never had to worry about being stranded or inconvenienced with a breakdown.  Too many people have never had the experience to own a ""worry-free"" vehicle like this one.  Many have come to believe that changing an alternator, starter, or similar unit is a common maintenance procedure (Most domestic designed vehicles).  This is not so with a well-engineered such as Mitsubishi's Montero.  Even with delayed maintenance, the Monteros I have owned performed like new until the day I traded them in."
mitsubishi,montero,2004,FrankP, 01/28/2009,Work horse,4,"I purchased my 04 Montero with about 10K miles on it.  It now has 191,000 and still going strong.  I have been very strict with the oil changes - every 5k and most of the other suggested maintenance.  The vehicle has never left me stranded.  It is excellent off road with great clearance and easily goes where other mid-size utes won't dare.  The highway ride is good too and it does a decent job towing my camper.  Very comfortable seats except 3rd row is for small kids only.  I've had to replace the catalytic converter twice very $$$ and had the manifolds off both sides of the engine develop heat cracks which had to be repaired - other wise no issues.  Trans, 4WD and motor no issues at all."
mitsubishi,montero,2004,Shirley Price, 01/01/2006,Great all around vehicle!,4,"Tired of being pelted with cigarettes, pushed around by wind, and being srayed with garbage truck 'stuff' I traded in my 2004 Toyota MR2 Spider for a Mitsubishi Montero Limited. The Limited has great pick up, a luxury car ride, and every creature comfort. I no longer fear aggressive / distraced drivers, bad weather, not so safe neighborhoods, or buying too many groceries. Its gas mileage isn't great, but I knew this before purchase. My cost for insurance was a surprise, I guess the rate assumes if I were to hit something it will be flattened. Maybe that's why I like her so much; the Montero is a great mixture of luxury, beauty and brawn."
mitsubishi,montero,2004,DLRILEY418, 05/09/2004,BEST RIDE,5,"IN THE PAST I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL GM

mitsubishi,montero,2004,IanC, 06/12/2004,Mitsu rocks,4,"This is my second Montero - the first I 
traded after 120000 miles in 2 years - 
lots of driving and nevr missed a beat. 
The 3.8 has improved the power enough 
that when you need it it is there. I 
commute 45 miles each way daily and 
nevr get tired of the Mitsu - this 
vehicle is a hidden gem. The 3rd row 
seat we only use occasionaly and it is 
tight but for the kids they are fine. 
The turning radius is great - a lot 
easier to park than the domestic 
bohemouths like the Tahoe. If you 
looking for a compact well built, 
occasional 7 passenger that will fit 
easily anywhere - the mitsu has it !! 
Great Vehicle - compleely underrated by 
most. Will continue to buy."
mitsubishi,montero,2004,twinn, 07/09/2004,Exnlt choice,4,"I read reviews that the Montero lacked 
power.  Well, I am a senior citizen 
who no longer has to drive every 
vehicle like it is a Porsche.  This 
vehicle has enough power for me.  
However, during mountain driving, the 
5 speed auto will down shift to lower 
gears and it is a bit sluggish.  Gas 
mileage is not that great, but it is 
an SUV and none of them get good gas 
mileage.  The third row seat is not 
intended for adults to get in and out; 
it is for children or very flexible 
adults."

vehicle with an MSRP of $36,074 for 
$18,500 plus our trade-in, which was a 
2000 Montero Sport LS with 64,500

extremely reliable, particularly off 
road. Highway ride is smooth although 
this new one seems louder than my 
previous '98. With the 3rd seat out the 
rear is a cavern. The second seat is 
comfortable even on long trips. Even 
with the new larger engine it still 
seems a bit underpowered off the line 
but cruises effortlesly on the 
turnpikes. The 2 wheel/4 wheel/all 
wheel drive system is the best anywhere 
that I have experienced. It has the 
feel, fit and finish of a LandCruiser

nothing on the market under or around 
$40,000 that gives what the Montero 
gives. I've got an 03 and see no 
changes except for the DVD player vs 
the huge sunroof. I sure would like to 
see the montero compared to some of 
the other SUV's out there, or maybe 
there is a reason it isn't. It would 
put to shame some of the other dual 
color plastic interiors and exteriors."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,saundra Anderson, 08/16/2006,Montero #2,4,The Montero handles like a small car with SUV capabilities.  It tows 5000 pounds without a problem.  Its third seat is a bit cramped for an adult though.  I dislike the spare tire on the tailgate because it makes the trailer hitch difficult to access. I plan to purchase Montero #3 soon.
mitsubishi,montero,2005,hard2please, 08/25/2006,Love Monteros,4,"The only gripe I have is this vehicle should be two inches wider and two inches shorter.  I am not a boulevard cruiser and use this vehicle to get me to some pretty rough terrain here in Oregon.  This is my fourth one and I will snub Mitsubishi for not keeping this line going.  It is a tough truck with a quality build and it holds up well on USFS roads and trails, unlike the Endeavor, which cannot clear rocks and ruts.  Who supplies the paint for these vehicles?  It has a deep finish and holds up to backroad rocks.  Good job on the Monteros, Mitsubishi!  "
mitsubishi,montero,2005,CLALawDog, 05/27/2005,Montero,4,"This is my second Montero.  I have driven SUVs most of my adult life and the Montero is, by far and away, the best.  There are so many SU-wanna-a- be's on the market that few true 4WD SUV's are left to compare.  However the Toyota, Jeep, Nissan, and Mitsubishi are the top of the class.  If you truly want or need a 4WD, stick with one that has driver-selected 4WD, not automatic all wheel drive.  That is nothing more than a sales tactic and cost enhancement."

Towing a single axle with 2 small ATVs we get 6 miles to the gallon on the freeway.  Tthis truck is fun to drive and great off road, but if you try to tow anything you will be very dissappointed."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,sawlman, 04/22/2005,"So far, so great",4,"The Pilot, Expedition Ltd, Sequoia and Lexus LX were our first choices.  The Mitsubishi wasn't even a consideration...until we tried it. It looks great inside and out.  It drives wonderfully on street and highway (have not taken it offorading where it has received most of its accolades from 4x4 magazines and intl. races). It handles well: acceleration, cornering, braking.  Gas mileage is avg (14city/19hwy).  Price is low.  If you are looking for a mid to large luxury SUV this is worth at least a test drive. Price is very negotiable right now with SUV sales plummetting because of gas prices and Mitsubishi isn't doing well compared to other car makers.  Shoot considerably below invoice."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,gary krupnick, 05/09/2005,Happy Consumer,4,"This is our fifth Mitsubishi Montero and the reliability and value are the best out there, we have owned most of the competition and they generally don't compare in all respects"
mitsubishi,montero,2005,Bully, 06/06/2005,The mule,4,"This is my 3rd Mitsubishi Montero . I really love the vehicle. The only problem I have with all of my Monteros is gas mileage. I have been across the U.S.A twice, encountering, all kinds of good/bad roads/weather.and my Monteros never fail me. I am happy for the extra engine power my 2005 especially when pulling 5&6 percent road grades in Nevada / Colorado (faster than a 18 wheeler, slower than Grey Hound bus).  I am sorry to hear of the montero's demise in '06 or '07. There was so much Mitsubishi could have done to inprove it's Monteros. You have a very good vehicle."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,robert, 06/17/2005,my new Mitsubishi,4,"When driving my new Montero from Michigan to Florida and back I was able to find a lot of new reasons to like my new SUV. The head rest you can easily lean back on, the 7 disks of music I had loaded, the automatic air control for front and for back.  The leather heated seats is awesome in the winter and the sunroof is immense in the summer.  The ride is so smooth over the pothole and ruts of northern roads as well as easy over off road conditions. Power everything!   All the other joys I have yet to discover."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,Brian K., 07/17/2005,Montero,4,"Very pleased with overall performance of the vehicle.  One criticism the vehicle had was acceleration, and that is unnoticeable.  We have a family of four and with all passengers in car we have more than ample acceleration.   We are definitely pleased with the vehicle."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,chris, 11/03/2005,Love,4,"No one can quite explain the love someone has for their vehicle, but the love with my 2005 Mitsubishi Montero is unconditional.  The way it handes is wonderful.  It has sophisticated looks great torque.  This truck is great for all roads, with its different 4WD modes and shiftomatic options. I ablolutly love this truck it is the best and I would recomend it to anyone.  My friends say that it is very good looking for a sixteen year old vehicle.  Everyone tells me my truck is the hottest one in the parking lot.  It gets great gas mileage.  I say this proudly, it is not just an SUV it is a Mitsubishi Montero."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,BritishGirl, 07/09/2005,My new Toy,4,"I got this vehicle just last month and I have to say this meets all of my needs. It has the luxury I wanted.  The drive I enjoy, looks great, makes me HAPPY."
mitsubishi,montero,2005,woodley, 11/12/2004,SO FAR SO GOOD/GREAT,4,"My whole family has been thrilled with this SUV.  The kids love the DVD, my wife likes the visibility, and I enjoy the power and handling. I Owned four Explorers previously, the '93,'96,'98,& 2000 XLT's, and I didn't know what we were missing. Who knew that my big screen TV brand could top FORD. "
mitsubishi,montero,2005,B H, 03/14/2005,Underrated,5,This is a true SUV. Seats 7 for sporty issues with kids. Reliable in snow and secure on potholes. Great service from dealer. If you are looking for something country and city without the supper horse power (gets you tickets) this is the real McCoy.
mitsubishi,montero,2005,Bernard Herrera, 04/26/2005,Underrated,5,"Get the big bucks for your run. Reliable and robust. No hassle off road and on road. Beautiful for snow, rain and mountain. Fun in NYC buckle roads and streets. Confy for long trips as well as fun. Glad is under rated for it cost less and you get all the luxuries, leather, sunroof, 6 CD, third seat, alloy wheels, roof rack etc.... Have portable DVD and Magellan. Feels and rides safe as to avoid speeding tickets. Has all the power to pull boat and utility open trail. What else...?"
mitsubishi,montero,2005,TRACY, 01/07/2005,MONTERO,5,NOT a very powerful engine but just right for the package.  Got caught in sleet storm with more than an inch of mire on the ground and did not miss a beat.  Is kind of loud on the inside could use more sound technolgy.
mitsubishi,montero,2005,schaefer, 04/13/2005,Lovin' my Mitzu!,4,"I absolutely love the way my SUV looks.  I drive around town, carting my 3 girls here and there.  There is plenty of room, and I get tons of compliments from males and females.  My husband added some sporty wheels which really finished the look.  The only complaint I would have is that the side step rail is too thin.  It is harder to use than to just hop out on your own.  My favorite thing about it would have to be the HUGE sunroof!  I just love it, and so do the kids!  We can't wait to drive it to Florida this summer.  "
mitsubishi,montero,2005,Fred Wittmer, 07/21/2006,Great Mitsubishi,4,"Our '05 Montero Limited is a great vehicle.  It rides like a car. It has plenty of room with great amenities. It gets pretty good gas mileage on the highway, but it is no so good around town. I would recommend it to anyone. "
mitsubishi,montero,2005,john, 01/20/2005,Wow! What a bargain!,5,"My wife has wanted one of these since they changed in 2001.  She finally got it and will not even let me drive it, except to do oil change.  Very comfortable and responsive.  "
mitsubishi,montero,2005,Yvonne, 03/23/2005,New Owner,4,"I am a new owner and therefore can only tell you about 1,000 miles worth of information.  The interior is leather, warm and spacious. I use the SUV for shopping, beach and mini excursions.  I have grandchildren, so I need the space. However when alone or with a friend I have all I need.  One complaint is about the middle head rest on the back of the middle seat. It blocked my vision. So I removed and wella!  So far so good! I LOVE IT!"
mitsubishi,montero,2005,Ronald Elzy, 04/21/2005,Extremely satisfied,4,"This vehicle has only required routine maintenance. It has an extremely good ride and is very well equipped. I looked at quite a few ""mid sized"" SUV's the Mitsubishi has considerably more to offer!"

This is our third Montero (1992, 2001, 2005) Our other Monteros were so dependable we see no reason to buy anything else.  Every year we road trip our vacation and the Monte is an awesome vehicle for traveling; comfortable, spacious, decent fuel mileage and room for a ton of luggage. "

Nissan and to my knowledge most of SUVs and trucks with 4 wheels drive do this but I got this one I can do U turn or sharp turns with 4 wheels drive selected and won’t see any difference and no front wheel binding or truck jumping like a horse
It has a lots of power when I pull any thing U want even feel it 
If there is more 5 stars to give this truck I would give it the max 
Very high quality design and high quality materials

mitsubishi,montero,2006,WRM, 11/16/2006,Go Buy One - You Won't Regret it!,5,"My wife wanted her SUV back after a year driving an economy car. I bought her a Montero Limited and she loves it - it is just the right SUV for a woman, she says. It is easy to drive, has a great warranty, 5 years of roadside assistance, it is comfortable, roomy, has easy to use 4WD, etc.   She was so happy I brought this truck home. She had a Ford Explorer last time and said the Montero beats the Explorer by a mile. This SUV is well built, rides smoothly, looks great, and I like it too. I stand 6'3"" tall and I can ride in this SUV no problem. Take the time to test drive this SUV and compare it to what you want to buy. Oh, my wife loves the rear tail gate. It swings out like a gate and is very easy to use.  Try it out!"
mitsubishi,montero,2006,Ronnie, 12/30/2005,My Second Montero,5,"This is my second Mitsubishi Montero, I still have my first one 1998).  The performance is more than I need, I don't need more of a gas-eater when gas costs $3.00 per gallon.  This Montero is fast, shift smoothly, has good fuel economy and I feel safe in it. If I were to tow anything, I have all the pep that I need. I compared the Montero to the Dodge Durango, but I have had past service problems with Dodge dealers.  Ford Explorers' double timing belt costs $2,000 to replace.  The Volkswagen Touareg and BMW X5 are way out of my budget.  Even the Toyotas in this segment are expensive.  My Montero is a 2006 XLS.  I got it at a ""Buy It Here"" lot in Puerto Rico.  I paid $29,000 for it.  I decided not to pay $34,000 for the Montero Limited with leather, moonroof, and wood dash. I didn't need the DVD system either."
mitsubishi,montero,2006,seminole_67, 12/03/2009,Excellent Truck,4,"I wanted one of these when they changed the body style in 2000. I now have the last Black Limited in my area. It is by far a great vehicle. Comfy, roomy, leather, heated seats, moonroof, all a plus. It has excellent quality, no issues what-so-ever to date. I get many complements on my truck, as many people haven't had the pleasure to have seen the Montero Limited. Coming from a 1998 Expedition, this was big change for me. I had looked at the Toureag, H3, and Aspen, this is the one I came away with. I am truly happy. Would buy another one."
mitsubishi,montero,2006,Ronnie, 12/01/2005,Excellent Monty,5,"This is not my first Montero, I just bought a 2006 XLS model that I found for sale In Puerto Rico.  It's about $4,000 less than the Limited model, but I don't want leather, wood in the dash, or a sunroof for $4,000.  It has power.  This SUV can ""only"" tow 5,000 pounds with the V6 engine, but what the heck this is a luxury vehicle if I wanted to haul something I would buy a beefy gas eating pickup like the Chevrolet Silverado Z71 that I used to have.  The Montero is a winner.  I hope that the engine has stong seals, that is a well known problem with the Montero, but with a 100,000 mile warranty I can handle that."
mitsubishi,montero,2006,Beaulieu, 09/11/2006,Montero,4,"My wife and I love our Montero. The off-road handling is awesome, the independent suspention does a great job absorbing the bumps and keeping you in control. The engine has a bit less horsepower than other models but the gearing in the transmission makes up for it. The vehicle looks awesome, like your ready for the Paris-Dakar. With this one, we probably could run it!  We have approximately 50,000 miles on it and have had NO warranty or miscelaneous issues at all with the vehicle. We have 2.5 year old triplet boys, we can fit all three in forward facing car seats in the 2nd row and still have the rear cargo area left.  We picked the perfect vehicle for winter fun, beach fun and all round daily driving."

I fell in love with the entire structure and feel about this beautiful vehicle.  The funny thing is that I didn't want to rent a SUV, I wanted a luxury car to drive on my vacation.  I week after I got home I purchased a new 2006 Mitsubishi Montero for myself.  I love it. "

mitsubishi,montero,2006,Duncan, 09/20/2007,2006 Mitsubishi Montero,4,"Excellent off road performance; especially in snow and ice.  Top interior features, comparable to a Lexus.  Could use more power, maybe a turbo diesel engine for mileage and performance.  Uses 93 octane, probably a good thing but it does cost more, and makes me more fuel conscious.  All around I am pretty happy."

(all monteros have it)"
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Luke, 08/26/2015,Great vehicle 15yrs later,5,"Bought my 2000 Mitsubishi Montero Sport new in the fall of 2000.  It's been an extremely dependable and reliable vehicle for 15 years and 130,000 miles. Rarely has it been garaged or babied. It's driven 20-40 miles most days in all weather and is rarely off road. 
I keep up on basic maintenance and service like tune ups, oil, tires, brakes, etc but have let all the dings, scratches go. The transfer case shifts in and out just fine after 15 years of trouble free 4x4 snow and rain. Sunroof sometimes leaks if debris clogs the drip path. Engine still runs well without a noticeable decline in performance.  The only trouble under the hood was the A/C compressor went out in August 2014 during Indiana's hottest time of year -- I had heard it for weeks before it quit.  I finally had to replace the brakes rotors and calipers in 2014. The door lights don't turn on every time when you open the door and it doesn't always ding when you leave the headlights on or the keys in the ignition.  The Infinity CD player quit but the radio still works even though my wife broke the antenna years ago. It's getting rusty spots behind the wheel well corners. So far no wrecks. 
My 3 kids and I have spilled tons of drinks and food, but the interior is fine -- no rips in the leather. The back seat is a bit narrow for three car seats so and I had to buy Euro-designed car seats to fit three across. This was getting hard on the back and then we got a minivan. I still drive it anywhere like across the state line or farmers field and I plan to drive it a few more years. No regrets, I love it.

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Lukas, 02/26/2009,Truck truck,4,"Bought used w/ 70k miles, so far almost 30k miles later and still loving it, the only mechanical problem I have had was the small part in fuel pump (unfortunatelly I had to buy the whole unit $560 w/ repair). Nothing else done to the engine or the truck itself. I live in snow country - the bottom is rusty or should I say rustic... That amount of salt will eat alive anybody. Great comfort, great tow, perfect in the snow, 4x4 is fun to drive - I highly recommend to anybody. I've seen models w/ 160k miles on them - the only thing - do not put syntetic motor oil, I noticed lesser performance... Not sure how it is possible, but the truck works better on regular oil... It's a keeper!"

The only major complaint is an intermitant rattle that the dealer cannot locate."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,comatt, 05/04/2011,I love my Montero Sport,4,"I have had mine for about 3 years, it has 120,000 miles and love it.
It has been a great roadtrip vehicle, I have taken it on many 1000+ mile trips and it is comfortable, gas mileage could be better but it performs well.
I have had no service issues with it, and have done all the regular maintanence on it.
I recently changed the belts to find that the originals were still on it after 11 years of use.
The interior holds up well; my leather seats barely show any wear and the buttons and dials all still appear new.
This is a great SUV and I intend to run her for many years to come."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,good looking suv, 06/24/2008,good suv,4,"I imported this car from USA to Honduras three years ago when we become a family of four.

In this moments it has a strange problem, when I park it for about ten minutes with the motor on and a/c too, it doesn't move, like without power. I have to turn it off wait and then it will move.

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Brad, 10/18/2007,The best blend of everything,5,"I bought it when it was 8 months old with 19K miles, after a stint as a rental. As wary as I was at the time to buy a rental, I have been overwhelmingly pleased with its performance since. This SUV is solid, well-built, comfortable, and rugged. Still gets great gas mileage (24 on hwy), and has very low maintenance demands, even for a 4WD.  My Montero now has 101,000 miles and is still running strong. It is a strong performer off-road and in the snow.  I am able to easily navigate 2-4' of snow (no exaggeration) when many of my neighbors' more expensive SUVs and trucks remain idle or stuck. It has outlasted 2 other used cars in my household and I fully expect another 100K without concern."

I've driven her as far West as Texas, Orlando Florida, and numerous times to Philadelphia Pa. All 3 of my adult children at one point had to drive her when they needed transportation. I am pleased with her. Should she quit tomorrow. I can honestly say I got my monies worth and then some. I wonder if Mitsubishi will make me their spokes person. :)"

Comming close to 60,000 miles it has not failed me yet. Great ride, fun for road trips.  People I have driven places have complimented me on its proformance and looks(they wish they had bought it instead of there vehicle).

constant tick in the engine due to a 
flawed lifter design; seats are 
uncomfortable for any multi-hour trip.  
Back seats sit at such an angle that 
they jar your spine on any bumps.  
Unfortunately it is now really a 
Chrysler product under the covers, and 
therefore not reliable or supported 
after the sale. "
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Todd, 12/06/2004,Issues,2,"Although I liked my Mitsubishi Montero Sport for the most part, I don't belive it was constructed well.  I've had a large number of problems with this vehicle. Initially it was a little oil leak, which always seem to take a while to fix.  After it was repaired, some lifters were getting stuck.  After several failed attempts to get this fixed, I ended up getting a new short block.  With that repair, they damaged the bolt that one of the tension pulleys is mounted to, causing it to shear off a month or so later.  Now I have additionaloil leaks, from the head gasket to the cam plug o-rigns.  Other issues include poor shifiting from 3rd to 4th when accelerating quickly."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Myarw, 01/28/2006,Won't Buy Another One,2,"I have owned my Mitsubishi Montero Sport for four years and I can't wait to unload it.  It has many transmission problems.  It's very sluggish starting out and has an annoying slip between 2nd and 3rd gears.  It's a smooth ride once you get past 3rd gear.  The sensors are a big problem, I've replaced my O2 sensor two times at the tune of $189 each time only to have them go bad again within a year. Then the service engine soon light came on.  Now the 4 wheel drive is going bad too.  I am trading it soon and can't wait to be rid of it.   "
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Christopher Dunn, 04/11/2016,Have had for a month but love it already.,5,"I just bought it a month ago for $2000. The guy lied about some things, but I can't complain. And it was probably overpriced. It only had 156,000 on it and I've put about 600 on it. The only things wrong are that there's a loud squealing coming from it, we think it's the power steering pump, and the radio shuts off after 3 minutes and I have to press eject and the power button just for it to turn on for another 3 minutes. I was upset to find out that this one doesn't have 4 wheel drive, but it did pretty well in snow and does great in rain. The only time I got stuck was in mud next to a drive way. The gas mileage is great compared to the smaller jeep I used to drive. It fits a car seat pretty well. It's hard for me to put him in just because it's a smaller space putting him in than it is in a car with bigger doors. Storage is great. Suspension is pretty good. Overall fantastic SUV. Would love 4 wheel drive though. I would definitely buy it again.

it has had problems with oil leaks, my 
mechanic called Mitsubishi who said 
they have been making the 3.0 ltr. 
engine for 10 years and this has always 
been a problem.  If they know this, why 
don't they fix it?  The seats will kill 
you on a long trip, they are extremely 
uncomfortable.  The turning radius is 
terrible, just to park in a spot at the

in, back up.  I will never own another

WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Jasun, 07/12/2002,Great SUV for great price,5,"I got my Montero Sport XLS brand new in 
2000. The car looks great, I always get 
compliments. The power when i head up 
to the mountains is more than adaquate 
even with the air conditioning on full 
blast. Another great aspect is the fuel 
mileage. I am averaging about 20 to 21 
miles per gallon!!! The ride is 
surprisingly quiet for an SUV. Great 
SUV, highly recommended. If you are in 
the market for a used car get the 2000 
Montero Sport overt a 2001 or 2002. 
They have begun transforming the car to 
more of a Xterra type instead of a 
nicer 4 runner type. They offer less 
options in the newer ones. In my 
opinion the 2000 is the best Montero of 
all."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,javaman, 07/15/2002,"Problems, problems, and more problems",3,"I have always had a front-end creaking 
noise that the dealers could fix/find. 
Several of the switches have had to be 
replaced that had stopped working. The 
servicing dealership (Burlington 
Mitsubishi) overfilled the automatic 
transmission with fluid causing it to 
overheat. At this point I am going to 
trade it in on a Toyota 4-runner or 
Sequoia. The resale values are so much 
better for the Toyota's and their 
reliability is great (my wife drives a 
4-runner). I would not recommend this 
vehicle to anyone...getting good 
service seems next to impossible (I 
have visited 3 separate dealerships for 
servicing)."

tow a 21 ft boat around with it without 
any trouble. Decent fuel mileage for an 
SUV. Dealership are crooks.  Told me 
the brakes were almost worn out at 
18000 miles and they actually lasted 
another 30000 after that.  Has been 
very reliable - I have had no problems

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Timonfan, 08/07/2002,Rough Ride,3,"The only major complaint I have of my 
Monetero Sport LS is it rides too much 
like a truck.  For those unfortunate 
enough to ride in the back seat it is 
an extremely rough ride.  Every little 
bump jars your body.  I recently spent 
4 hours in the back of a Montero sport

hurting the next day."

worth. If your in the market for a used

funny but whom ever buys it used is 
going to get a heck of a deal. DONT BUY 
A NEW ONE, BUY A USED ONE!"

underrated SUV. The craftmanship is of 
quality, it is very reliable and priced 
very reasonably.  My wife and I test-
drove the 4 Runner, Chevy Blazer and 
Dodge Durango during the decision 
making process.  We found the Montero

owned (I traded in a 1997 LS) and the 
only cause for significant complaint 
would be the level of sevice received 
from Mitsubishi Dealerships.  The 
Montero Sport is quiet and rides smooth 
(for a truck).  The ""New for 2000"" coil 
spring rear suspension really made the 
ride quite a bit smoother.  In fact I 
will argue too smooth since I had to 
add air springs to level out the ride 
when loaded down for long trips."

new Toyota 4 Runner Limited, Dodge 
Dacota 4x4, a Murc.Mountianeer and the 
Mitsubishi 2000 Sport XLS 4x4. Of all 
of them we agreed that the Sport had 
the best road feel, body tightness and 
general responce and efficiency in the 
overall drivability. Last year on a

was brand new and we were afraid that 
it would handle better then the

  This is the only vehicle I've ever 
owned that my wife and I are able to 
use the same seat adjustments, 
however, in the lowest seat setting, 
my head is almost to the headliner, a 
drawback to having a moonroof.

year.  It's a great looking vehicle, 
very large cargo space (spare tire is

is the best 4x4 we have owned.  It is a 
great compromise between an all out 
heavy duty truck type 4x4 SUV (like the 
older 4Runners) and the newer Car based 
SUV's. It drives as good in the NW 
rain, snow, and ice as it does in the 
Hawaiian sun.  The power of the 3.5 V6 
is Outstanding as are the handling and 
ride.  We consistently get 20 MPG.  The 
reclining rear seats are nice (we 
didnt realize they reclined until this 
year) as are the storage compartments

down."

stereo.  Love the extra storage

exterior looks. You would never be
afraid to go anywhere with this truck on
or off road.You can rely on it's engine
not to leave you cold on the road.  Good
suspension. The downside is the large
turning radius. Can't maneuver quickly
in a tight parking spot in one approach.
The ac needs more time to cool off the
interior in hot summer, unlike the
Toyotas. Had some frustrating electrical
glitches; like the auto lights on (dome
light) when  I open the pass door side.
Alarm failed to arm during very cold winter."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Nicholas, 07/27/2005,Good midsize SUV,4,"The Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a solid SUV for $10,000 less than the Mercedes and a better truck besides. It burns regular gas. Tows a boat easily with the 3.5L engine in the Limited. Gas mileage decent at 17-21, a little less in winter. One problem with leaking fluid from the front transaxle due to a bad seal, but no other problems at all. None. I have tied huge things to the top luggage rack and drove home no problems. If you want a car, buy the Lexus for 35% more money, but for more of a truck look and feel, this is hard to beat. This is even more comfortable than the Toyota 4Runner I thought about purchasing."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,rsr72, 03/18/2003,held up well,4,"We have had the Montero Sport for three 
years now.  It has held up well.  Great 
interior, seats, and excellent paint 
quality. The gold paint looks almost as 
good as when it was new. Decent power, 
low wind noise and acceptable ride for 
a truck-based SUV.  The Montero 
compares favorably to the other 
vehicles we have recently owned - a 
Toyota Tundra (poor gas mileage, 
horrible seats and so-so paint quality) 
and a Honda Civic (poor paint quality, 
interior rattles."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,desertwitch, 03/20/2006,Love My Montero,4,"I love this SUV.  I've taken it on 500 mile plus trips and it's been very comfortable.  I tow a small boat with it and experience no loss of power.  The Infinity stereo system is really good for a factory install.  Security is great with a chip in the key.  It couldn't be more reliable.  I've had it for six years now and it's never had any problems.  I found it handles much better with slightly wider, taller tires.  Prior to that, it didn't handle well on wet roads.  For an SUV, I can't complain about the mileage.  It seems very well made which is good as parts are on the expensive side."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Stace, 08/25/2006,Reliable and Sporty Looks,4,"I bought my Montero Sport new.  I changed the oil every 5,000 miles and have never had a problem with this truck.

To date, we have not had to replace or repair any major components and it has been extremely reliable.  I have found that general maintenance at times tends to be expensive.  To replace and access problems requires many labor hours.  Its resale values are appear to be low, which is great for buyers but bad for sellers."

I bought it used and although it does need bearings which seems a bit early considering the mileage I can't complain. It is absolutely the most comfortable car that I have ever owned and I have owned many through the years, including luxury cars.  I am 5' 2"" and my hubby is 6' 2""  and we are both are extremely comfortable driving this vehicle. It gets very good gas mileage, too. I give it an A+++++++ all the way."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Derrick, 01/28/2007,Goody,4,"My Montero Sport has been a solid performer over the years! It has good pick up and steering response. It is a little short on the turning radius though and it started to burn oil at 60,000 miles.  Otherwise this truck has had very low maintenance cost. It has plenty of leg and head room for taller than average driver and passengers. The stereo is adequate and the heat/air is better than average. "
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2000,Aubrey, 10/16/2007,Its a TRUCK,2,"Beware! It drives like a truck, feels like a truck, and yes its a truck not your average passenger SUV. So far no major repair expenses but we have had some performance and usability issues on the 4WD. When brand new it was not worth the price! Also, big recommendation: disable the ""anti lock brakes"" feature or you will not have control over the vehicle on slippery roads or in an emergency need to stop event (you can unplug this on each side of the front disk brakes).

It has now become my favorite car ever. It looks great, performs well, and my brother, a professional mechanic, said that it is in amazing shape for a vehicle of its age. It is probably underpowered for towing, but that's not what I wanted it for. It has about the same pickup as my old 4 cylinder Outback, but with the increased size of the car and the 6 cylinder standard, I'd say that's pretty good. "

AMAZING:
Other than buy a new car battery after 4 years, do the brakes & Oil, and change an O2 sensor for DEQ - this car has ran like a champ with little to no down time in the mechanic shop.

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,E. Henderson, 08/04/2009,Great Purchase,4,"I purchased my SUV new as a lease in 2001. After my lease was up, I decided to purchase the truck. It was the best decision I have made on an automobile. I have kept up with the maintenance since day one. I have not had any problems, except the battery. I currently have 113,000 miles as of today 08/04/09. It only gets about 17mpg city, but besides the gas mileage, I really like my automobile."

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,MitsuDude, 07/25/2003,Good deal...except for...,3,"4wd, torque and stability are superb.  
Ride comfort...the seats are better 
than you'll find in most luxury 
vehicles.

Unless you have a 3.5l engine, you'll 
find the Montero Sport is severely 
underpowered. 

I have had numerous nagging electrical 
problems:
-replaced headlamps (bulbs) 6 times
-replaced right headlamp
-replaced front parkign lamps 
-replaced all brake lamps
-replaced taillamps
-4wd switch malfunctioned, replaced
-interior lighting shorted, repaired
-antenna needed replacing

I have had to replace brake pads more 
often than I would like.

The chrome grille began to peel, but my 
dealer replaced it for free."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,mlbrink, 08/19/2003,Great Vehicle for Small Families,4,"I bought this car new over two years 
ago.  My wife is the principle driver 
and she loves it.  Her only complaint 
is that it isn't big enough for our 
family of 5.  The kids need more 
separation.  (I told here she should 
have got a mini van, but she loves the 
way this looks.)"
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,Teclarosa, 05/30/2005,Best value I have found,4,"I could not have found a better deal than the one that I got on my Mitsubishi Montero Sport.  Its power lacks a little, but it drives like a well, not like an SUV, and it's a 'small' SUV that's easy to park but still has room for my luggage, supplies and a sound system for my gigs. I've had no major and almost no minor mechanical or electrical problems.  The interior is very comfortable, even the seats on the 10-hour vacation drives. HINT: look for a 'program' (rented) model if you can find one in good condition - mine was 1yr old & had 13,000 miles on it for $21,000. My long-time mechanic says it should last me another 6-8 years if I want it to."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,ctepedino, 01/02/2013,Make sure you have Triple AAA!,2,"We bought this car used a little over a year ago.
It is a 2001.
We drove it very little at first, but since August we have driven it everyday locally.
Since August, we have had it towed three times and drove it limping into the garage two times.
I have spent about $1500 in repairs.
The worst thing is driving it with the anticipation of when will it go out again.
The car had about 120,000 miles on it when we bought it.
We have put about 11,000 miles on it this year (which is a normal average). Very scary driving knowing you will be stuck at one point or another."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,Sue, 04/19/2009,Disappointed,1,"I must say after owning a Honda and a Toyota the quality of the Mitsubishi has been really disappointing. I had the timing belt, front main leak, rear main leak, O2 sensor and Transmission all fail under 65000 miles. I feel that Mitsubishi is a poor product. They suffer from poor customer service, and the book value has a horrible, horrible return when you go to sell it. So I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants longevity."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,Macadamia2, 01/09/2003,My 3.5XS rocks!,4,"I was surprised when I saw the 
(currently) low 7.2 rating.  I've had 
my MS 2 years now and love it more 
than ever.  I have yet to see another 
SUV (except for a much more expensive 
Cadillac Escalade) that I think is 
sexier or cooler-looking!"
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,VA Girl, 09/04/2003,satisfied,4,"I like the way my MS drives, especially 
the 4 WD!  No major probs.  The look is

better tires!"
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,California, 03/31/2008,...A great bargain overall,3,"I had a choice:  pay a 16k balloon payment to keep my beloved 4-runner (with 96k miles) after its lease was up, or pay another $1500 and get a brand new montero with no miles.  To most it would be a no-brainer, but the day I turned in my 4-rnr, my eyes got a little watery. 6 years and 110k mi. Later, I still think fondly of the Toyota, but if you have to ""settle"" for another Japanese brand, I have to recommend the montero.  With the exception of replacing the steering column at 60k (right when the warranty ran out) I have not had any Major problems with this vehicle.  Yes, the gas mileage sucks, but this truck is now a valued family member, & I'll miss it when I find a diesel car that suits me."

performed very well. When 4-wheelin'

have been in some hairy areas! I 
suppose my only complaint is that the

higher."

a year now and have not had one 
problem (knock on wood) other than a 
factory recall which was fixed 
promptly.  Sure, you don't get great 
gas mileage, but what do you want from 
a 4,000 pound SUV.  It has just enough 
power, rides so smooth for a truck and 
looks better than any other SUV around 
(in my opinion)!"

full size Bronco owner (a horror 
story.  Perhaps I was spoiled but the 
Bronco's almost perfect interior 
accomodations.  My expensive 2001 3.5XS 
sucks as far as performance, gas 
mileage AND most importantly interior.  
There are no real cruise control 
controls on the steering wheel except 
the on/off lever which isn't as good as 
Ford's control system. The driver's 
seat literally gives me a pain in the 
behind to the point of being unable to 
drive for longer than an hour.  I am 
going to dump it because of that pain.  
It looks great and is very reliable but 
it's the pain that will cause me to 
dispose it."

oily substance leaking from it.  I took 
it back to the dealership and I haven't 
had a problem since.  It was something 
that had jarred loose during shipment 
and hey it came from Japan so maybe a 
few bumps.  I love the ride and the 
kids love being up high.  You can be 
stylish or sporty all in one vehicle.  
The four wheel drive is great.  I lease 
it and am thinking of buying a new one 
and keeping it when the lease is up on 
this one if it continues to be just as 
great.  I have never repeated a make of

4 average adults going 70 mph on the

trade value. Our 1 year old LS trade in

as many compliments on this truck, as I
do my cars.

lot, and I recommend it."

it.  I had problems with the disc 
brakes and the computer went out within 
the first 12,000 miles.  It lags 
between second and third gear.  Resale 
value depreciates faster than I can 
make the payments.  I'll never buy 
another Mitshubishi automobile."

The acceleration factor is not the

It looks like a million bucks, very rugged and sporty.  The power of the 3.5 in the XS model is outstanding, at least compared to many other competitors in this class.  This truck doesn't handle particularly well though.  It is a bit sloppy in the turns.  I have had a problem with uneven tread wear on the tires, with the outside of the front tires really getting worn.  The air conditioner is very weak on hot days - you have to put it on full blast just to try and stay somewhat comfortable. I've also had trouble getting it into 4WD mode early in the winter, if you haven't used it during the summer. Overall this is a decent vehicle.  "
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,Monty Owner, 07/22/2005,Love this car,5,"Only maintenance that has had to be done is routine, an oil change every 3,000 miles.

'04, when it only had 14,500 miles on it, with some hesitancey, due to low the mileage because of the year.  The dealer assured me that there was no need to worry and showed me a carfax report of the vehicle that was prestine.  I now have 31,000 miles and it ALREADY needs a new transmission! It was to-good to be true!Also has very minimal power. the truck looks great, but as the old motto says...""looks can be deceiving""."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,Montero Limited 4 WD, 09/23/2005,The Little SUV That Could!,4,"We bought our Mitsubishi Montero Sport new, and it was love at first sight! Its my prissy looking SUV with a work horse engine.  I routinely run up and down the Sierra Nevadas to Tahoe and it takes on anything thrown at it. It feels rock solid in the worst snow and ice conditons due to a well made 4WD.  It keeps its blissful cool in the warmest summers with its fleible climate control. The huge sunroof lets the stars in at night. I hauled 6 (SIX!) middle school boys in a carpool for 3 years, with 2 in the jump seat. Now that is head room.  The dual linkage allows you to control gearshifting making small work of big grades(and V8's!). It fits surfboards to kayaks, kids, dogs and parrots, this SUV thrives under family demands."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2001,hkisner, 01/06/2004,"Dependable, Solid",3,"The Montero Sport is not exciting,

is nothing wrong with it. "

I am the kind of person who gets buyer's remorse after buying a snickers bar, but this truck is great.  It is fun to drive, and is pretty comfortable.  It gets average gas milage, but if you are concerned about that then buy a Honda Civic.  I live in Boston, and this thing drives awesome in the snow.  I have the white with the dark tinted windows and it gets looks all the time.  I've had a little problem keeping the steering alligned, and that could be due to nasty city pot holes.  The tires seem to wear more quickly than I'd like, and almost every person I talk to who owns one says the latch on their arm rest is busted.  I also think that it needs more power."

Overall, I wish I hadn't. The Montero gets good gas mileage and seems to be reliable so far (I have under 70,000 miles). It has an awful turning radius, the A/C doesn't work and this winter my 4WD stopped working when I needed it most. However, I haven't put money into it and it's very roomy, which is great for trips with lots of luggage. Also, it doesn't hold its value. I like it, but I'd go with a Jeep next time. "

Overall, I would defitely buy it again, and I have had a Isuzu Rodeo, a pathfinder and an Xterra before this one.  
By far the best of them all so far, the pathfinder is a close second, but the ride is best with the Montero Spt.  The features of the Pathfinder are better though."

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,casetractor, 05/03/2012,One of the best cars I've owned,4,"Having owned at least 20 cars in my time, the Montero Sport is hands down one of my favorites. It has it all in terms of reliability, versatility, dependability, and value, and it looks pretty decent to boot. Having just turned 140,000 miles, I can honestly say nothing has gone wrong with the car, it still gets around 19 MPG combined, and I've only done the recommended maintenance. The interior is simple yet durable, and stands up to the daily abuse my two young kids submit to it. If I could find another Montero with fewer miles, I would purchase another one without hesitation and own two."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,Reed, 12/05/2015,The most honest Montero Sport review you'll read,4,"My dad bought this car brand new in 2002. That was the golden era of SUV's, so I was surprised he picked the Montero Sport. Since the beginning, it's never been a ""wow"" car. The interior is extraordinarily basic. Looks very outdated now. The exterior looks cool, but not as cool as other SUV's from the same time. We took trips across country with it and it never gave us major issues. He passed it down to me two years ago with 147k miles. He never did major work on it. Routine stuff like brakes and fluids. But I think he replaced the entire rear axel because it went out. In the past two years I've replaced the thermostat, valve cover gasket, alternator, battery, struts, tires and spark plugs. After 150k miles that kind of stuff is to be expected. Never had major issues with the engine or transmission. Mitsubishi reliability is pretty good. The ride height compared to the wheel base is a little off. It's tall and narrow so it gets sketchy at high speeds. They come with a torsion bar suspension so I raised the front 1.5"". It sits much better and even fits 31"" all terrain tires. 

It's pretty reliable and has nostalgia to me because of the road trips we took with it. I even named mine ""Monty."" I've contemplated selling it but the resale value is atrocious. It's worth it to me to keep it. Most of the ones you see on the road are beat to hell. So find one that's been taken care of and has low miles. This is a basic SUV so don't expect luxury or anything over the top. But if you're looking for a good budget SUV, a Montero Sport is a decent choice. It would also make a great first car.

I know these are popular for off-road use and that's the only thing they'd be good for, it's uncomfortable and shouldn't be allowed to transport more than three small adults."

We drove several different brands, Nissan, Toyota, even a big Chevy & Ford, and the big Montero.   I liked the way this truck drove best.  But I do like a ""tight"" chassis better than a swaying, ""unconnected"" feeling ride.  I got that from the Toyota & big SUV's. Its accelleration is good.  We have never had a problem with onramps or passing uphill.  And I like the transmission.  It downshifts when I want it to, and holds the gear for as long as I want it to (almost reads my mind).  I hate automatics that upshift too early.  The build quality seems to be top notch, too, almost comparable to our 2002 Honda Odyssey. There are no rattles, odd noises, or anything to complain about."

Mitsubishi had a large financial incentive on the '02 Montero Sport (which hurt them later on) so I bought one.  While my wife can have the luxury and creature comforts in her ride, I use my car to get me where I want to go.  And based on that alone, the Montero Sport does that reasonably well.  It's basic transportation, nothing more or less. Its ride is OK, nothing spectacular.  The interior comfort is OK, nothing spectacular.  The engine and tranny are OK, nothing spectacular.  It's a gas hog. I wrecked it in 2004 and it was expensive to fix the front end.  I hope to get 125,000 miles out of it."

better, is quieter, and has more power. 
My 4Runner had a much harser ride. I 
wish the Sport had tighter steering. I 
intend to drive my Sport over 100,000 
miles. I think the re-sale at that 
point will be only a little less, and 
it cost $4,000 less, than than a 
4Runner similarly equiped. I pull some 
boats and find the Sport a perfect 
compromise between comfort and utility.

makes up for it!"

has 174,000 miles. I was so amazed with 
its performance bought the New 2002. 
I'm sure I'll get the same performance 
if not better.  The Mitsubishi Montero 
Sport
is quiet comfortable and has power when 
you get on the freeway you move. No 
Dogs here when it comes to engine 
performance."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,hlb, 02/27/2002,Content with my Montero Sport LS,4,"Bought my Montero Sport LS a year ago and I have been very please with it.  I have about 10500 miles on the V6 auto, 4dr. 2WD, LS.  I only changed the oil every 3000 miles.  NO problem what so ever has accurred.  I was attracted to the vehicle based on the style, room inside and the test drive.  I normally keep my vehicle for about 10 to 14 years.  I have a 1990 Chev. Silveroda, V6 with 151200 miles on it and it still runs great."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,slow cooker, 01/30/2003,my first SUV,4,"The Montero Sport LS is a very good 
vehicle.  It has style, good power with 
just the standard v-6, and seems quite 
reliable.  Of course, with less than 
6000 miles on it so far the reliability 
hasn't really been challenged yet. 
My major issues so far are only 2:  
1. Exterior finish. Quite delicate.  I 
put a small mark on the door just by 
touching it lightly with my keys. Later 
I noticed some other marks under the 
same door, and I've no clue how they 
got there.
2. Handling.  On dry roads it drives 
like a sportscar, but on a wet road 
it's scary. Don't know if it's the 
vechicle itself or maybe the tire 
design, but I don't like it."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,Satisfied Customer 9, 06/10/2003,So Far So Good,4,"I bought the vehicle used at a fair 
deal. I have had no problems thus far.  
It rides like a car, very comfortable.  
Power/performance is noticably lacking 
but I did not purchase the vehicle to 
tow anything so it is not something I 
miss.  I have yet to use the 4 wheel 
drive feature for any length of time. 
All in all it has been good to me."

with more luxurious appointments and 
general interiour finish."

major problems with the car so far.

The horsepower is pretty sad.  And 
there is no gas mileage advantage 
having the V6 3.0.  A V8 Toyota Tundra 
gets the same gas mileage as I do.  
Also, the brakes squeel and the 
Mitsubish dealership says its normal.  
I like the car overal but they 
definately need some improvements. "

around 2K negative equity thinking I 
could absorb the 2K over time. Boy was 
I wrong! I've watched the Montero 
decline in value below HALF of what I 
owe. These Montero Sports have little 
trade-in value...they got me hook-line-
and-sinker! I have no out for a trade, 
I owe over 10K more than the retail

it's paid for, then I'll donate it to a

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,Taxi driver, 07/26/2006,Just Okay,2,"I find this Montero Sport to be just okay.  It rides rough, even with new tires and alignment.  It is very noisy with the back windows down at speeds greater than 35 mph.  The V6 engine is ok, but it does not have much power.  Also, the back seat doesn't have much room.  I bought it for traveling with the kids, but am very disappointed."

upside down in what you owe and what it 
is worth in six seconds flat even with

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,cruzer2k3, 10/21/2004,montero sport 2002,4,"The Montero Sport 2002 is a strong, 
dependable vehicle.  I liked the 
interior and exterior of the SUV very 
much.  The one thing that bothered me 
the most though was the suspensions 
were a little too much on the soft 
side, which made the ride somewhat 
uncomfortable if you were going over 
bumpy roads.  Fuel economy was my next 
concern, as the Montero can eat up gas 
like it was air (which is true of many 
other SUV's aswell).  Overall, it is a 
great off-roading SUV."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,Darin, 02/21/2005,Montero Sport has been great!,4,"I picked a Mitsubishi Montero Sport because of the reliability and looks. It has a look that many SUV's lack nowadays...smooth, simple lines, while remaining tough and rugged looking. Many manufacturers are starting to add strange lines and countours that don't appeal to the eye as much...the best SUV's (style-wise) were built in the late 1980's to early 90's, such as the Toyota Land Cruiser, Mitsubishi Montero, the old Ford Bronco, and the Toyota 4Runner. I am not sure if anyone agrees with me, but I will miss seeing new Montero Sports on the road."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,shopnbarefoot, 03/21/2005,Cute SUV,4,"The Mitsubishi Montero Sport is great for a young, smaller family.  It's very cute, functional and drives nicely.  It's only limitation is the lack of backseat room for people 5 feet or taller.  The cargo space exceeded everything I ever needed with 3 growing boys.  Did I say it is so cute?!"
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,Anthony Ampudia, 05/07/2007,My Montero Sport,3,So far the SUV has been very good. I had to replace the front pinion shaft seal on the differential but other than that I have no complaints. It is big enough for my family and powerful enough to tow our camper. The only thing I do not like about it is that both front and rear bumpers are not metal and thus can be easily damaged by other vehicles while parallel parking.
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,Phillygator, 04/20/2003,Me and My SUV,4,"I love the truck. The style of the 
vehicle inside and out is very 
handsome. I got the SUV at a great 
price used, and I havent had any 
troubles since (knock on wood). I 
traded in my 2002 Nissan Altima for the 
Montero Sport and I am extremely happy 
that I did so. Most people think that 
Nissan makes a superior product to 
Mitsu, but in the 5 months I owned my 
Altima, it was non-stop trouble. The 
Montero Sport has been a pleasure to 
own."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,anthonyorlando, 05/02/2003,"Good Truck, Need Improvements",3,"The Dealer can no fix the alignment, 
everytime i bring it in, it will pull 
to the right or left when they are 
done, still need alignment to get 
fixed.  Fuel economy is expected to be 
poor, try to squeeze a lot of horse 
power out of a small V6, but it's ok, 
peppy.  I would have thought after 
spending 32K on this, I would have auto 
headlights, and heated side mirros, but 
these can be improved on.  Truck looks 
cool, great color combo.  Seats are 
really stiff, there are other SUV's 
around the same price that are more 
comfortable."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,hc7454, 03/09/2002,Great at first then it goes downhill,2,First my 4WD stopped working.  They had to change several switces to get it working.  Then my battery died after only 1 year.  Then my security system died.  They had to change the entire security system wire to wire.  Then my car just wouldn't start.  They have replaced the starter which helped but it still has  starting issues.  Then my Radio stopped picking FM signals.  Then 2 months latter my CD player stopped working.
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,DianeKrause, 03/11/2002,Love my new baby!!!,4,"Great looking vehicle and great incentive to purchase as well, with the zero down and delayed payments.
The interior is beautiful and easy to work with, but the acceleration -- well it's just not happening.  If you want to merge with any authority, you have to put it in 3rd - absolutely.  However, it's worth it and it's fun to shift.  Gives you a little of the standard transmission buzz. 
 You have to have the sunroof, definitely."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,friendwithan02, 03/13/2002,Sorry but I have to tell the truth..,4,"I have to tell the truth about the Montero Sport, it's not that great considering the rest of the competition.
Power is subpar, mileage fairly poor, build quality average, overpriced, overall just a below average vehicle produced by a below average company.  The best thing about the Montero sport is it's looks.  I'd have to concur with Edmunds on just about everything about this SUV."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,xxjeffxx, 03/17/2002,So far so good.,4,This is pretty good SUV. I was told it would be underpowered but that is not the case. I am very happy with the performance. It could be more comfortable on long trips but its not bad. The 60 months no interest was the clincher and I am very happy with my decision so far.
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2002,Montero, 10/28/2018,Very reliable,5,"The Montero sport is a great truck. Currently have 212,000 miles and planning on keeping my montero for a long time. The quality is top notch, zero complaints.

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2003,scott.76, 10/11/2008,very reliable,3,"It's been a very solid vehicle. Not a single mechanical issue. It now has 85,000 miles on it. Some complaints I have are that after about an hour of driving I've got to get out and stretch my legs. The seat height is too low. It's definitely not a vehicle designed for a tall person. The roof is also quite low. The side steps aren't really functional so my seat is wearing because I essentially have to slide in and out. It handles great in the snow and does well off road. My sister bought an '03 Jeep grand Cherokee at the same time we bought our MS. They've had nothing but trouble with it. There's something to be said for the simple design of MS. Not a whole lot of gadgets that can break."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2003,du sais, 12/08/2006,CR Magazine Rating is Questionable!,4,"I've been a subscriber of this magazine and I have been pretty much dependent on their evaluation when purchasing stuff, until I purchased my Montero Sport.  The reason for this purhase - I got a very good deal, cheap considering that it's a limited 4x4 . Being aware that this vehicle is considered poor in their rating, I was surprised when I happened to drive it. It looks like the CR ratings are backwards. We have five adults in our household and in our garage there's an '02 Honda CR-V,  '01 Toyota 4Runner SR5 4x4 (which I drove most of the time before the MT Sport), &and a '04 Toyota Sienna XLS AWD. I find the MT Sport much better in acceleration and cornering than my 4Runner.  Also, its ride is far better than car based CR-V's.  I have had no recalls or trouble with my Mitsubishi yet."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2003,rrf, 04/14/2012,Excellent family hauler!,4,"Those who have kids know that newborns need plenty of cargo room. This vehicle has plenty! My wife and I purchased this vehicle anticipating the birth of our first son. We made an excellent choice. 

The Montero Sport is the perfect family hauler for the following reasons:

-Plenty of cargo space
-Has the LATCH car seat anchors
-Rear hatch opens upward to shelter you from the rain when you have to change your baby's diaper.
-The deck height in the cargo area is perfect for changing your baby's diapers. (See the theme?)
-Toddlers get dirty! The rear cargo area roof is tall enough enabling your toddler to stand. This makes impromptu clothes changes very easy. 
-Privacy glass helps with naps "
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2003,Noel, 12/26/2006,A Very Nice SUV,4,I bought this a few months ago. The SUV is very nice to drive. The engine runs very smoothly for a three year old vehicle. There is enough room for five passengers and enough space for cargo too.  the controls are easily accessible.

I love this SUV because it is stylish but most importantly reliable. My sons father has one and I said if I ever had the chance to purchase another used vehicle this one is it because in it has never given him major problems. The only con is the gas consumption but I will take that any day over what I use to drive. The previous owner took excellent care of this vehicle and I will do the same. Everyone who sees it is surprised at how old it is because it still competes with newer modeled SUV's. It should have never been discontinued."

mitsubishi,montero-sport,2003,vermontergirl, 08/31/2006,My Second One,4,"Before the two Montero Sports, I drove a Volvo 850.  This truck has only needed one minor thing in it's 60,000 mile history.  Just change the oil and go.  One winter (I run studded Nokians), it made it up the last 600' of my very steep driveway with 22"" of unplowed snow!  It took about four passes, but did it.  My driving is split between city and highway.  For mileage, I usually get 21 mpg in the summer and slightly less in the winter (studded tires).  This is not bad for a big SUV.  Of course, if you want to go 75 mph all day you won't get the same results.  The 2003s are really AWD all the time (90/10), which probably accounts for the decent gas mileage, and lock into 4HI+LO when needed."

He said the steering was ""squirrely,"" and he was right!  You can't take your eyes off the road for a second--this car will take you right off the road.  And the sway in this thing makes my kids sick!  No sway bar is available to correct it.  Also, because the entire hatchback lifts up, it drips water right on you if it's been raining.  Then, when you get home, your groceries fall out! I bought this because I liked the way it looked, but don't do it!"

We were promised zero down. That was 
true.
We were promised zero payments for one 
year. This was not true. In actuality 
we only received 6 months no payments.
We were promised zero % interest for 1 
year. This is not true. We actually 
received zero financing for five months.
We were told that we would be able to 
refinance this car. Not true. The blue 
book is so low compared to what is owed 
no bank will even look twice at it.

Be very weary. These deals are only 
there to help THEM SELL YOU CARS. They

We have had no problems running them each 50,000 - 60,000 miles, except the '98 which had a driver's side window defect.  We do a lot of highway driving and live in very mountainous/rural Oregon.  They have performed well on long road trips and four wheeling on local rough mountain roads and trails. Consumer's Report gave them a bad rap because they drove like a truck.  Then Mitsubishi modified the suspension and they got a bad rap for riding like a car!  It seems like Mitsubishi cannot do much to please that magazine. The materials inside and out are high quality.

Unbelieveably reliable and extremely low maintenance costs to date. Has had much off road use and almost all rural highway miles. The newer SUVs are much more energy efficient and comfy, but this is one tough, reliable vehicle. Maybe that is why they are so popular at Ft. Bragg and Ft. Lewis army ranger bases. I have never had a wheel alignment as one has never been needed, even though I drive over logs and rough terrain on my property and on local BLM fishing holes. I am a stickler about doing maintenance ahead of schedule, such as fluids. Back seats fold flat for my 6 foot carcas to sleep when out with the bears."

Never had a single problem with any one and have been impressed by the 4WD capability coupled with decent (22 mpg Highway) mileage. The seats are a little short, stopping way before my knees, and it needs side bolsters for where I go. I wish the engine had a different drive belt. It rides rough, but it is tough! I cannot figure out why the resale value has been so low on these models. This is a much better off-road vehicle than my Yukon XL."
mitsubishi,montero-sport,2004,Reggie, 07/21/2008,Not a mere show piece.,5,"A solid off and on road vehicle. Bought it primarily for off road and touring. Ample seating and cargo. Take it to San Gabriel OHV, CA and Hungry Valley SVRA, CA (Gorman), up Los Angeles National Forest roads when it snows. Have taken it from Palm Springs to Joshua Tree N Park via the Berdoo Trail. It's a XLS A4WD and the rest. Majestically conquers terrain, climbs effortlessly, fords above knee deep, traverses narrow passes, handles well over snow and ice, amply protected underbelly and axles over boulders especially submerged ones, coasts effortlessly @ 85 mph on freeways and gives 18 mpg combined.

The v8 has more than enough power and the payload is great. I had 18 90 lbs bags of concrete in the back, 3 separate times! Didn't even bottom out. Truck is clean and interior is plasticky so it's easy to clean. Can fit my 3 18 year old buddies in the back with plenty of room, and my 6'6"" 260lb dad fits fine in it. The bed is a little short, and the worst part, the fuel economy. I only drive around town and the 22 gallon tank goes 200 plus miles. Would do better on the highway, but around town the mpg is bad. Great truck overall!"
mitsubishi,raider,2006,CTG in Seattle, 08/26/2007,"Nice Truck, Great Value, Poor Fuel MPG",4,"I've had this truck for most of this year and it's a good truck.  The V8 pulls the wave runners and camper easily.  The back seat with the double cab has plenty of room, it's a fabulous looking truck.  No problems so far.  The gas mileage though is very poor and I was hoping for a few MPG better than I'm getting with mostly highway driving.  Mine came fully and the 5 year warranty make it a great value.  All leather, V8, power everything, 5 disc changer, bluetooth, etc.  I like it."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,LC, 12/22/2015,"Good looking, quick, reliable. Excellent value.",4,"This truck was priced at half the cost of similar used trucks I looked at (Dodge Ram, Nissan, Toyota, etc) back in 2012. It has a cushy ""Cadillac like"" ride from the air shocks (pillowy I call it) and is surprisingly quick when you punch the throttle. Excellent brakes have saved my ass numerous times. A good looking truck though the bulging fenders get you dirty if you're leaning in to put something in the bed. Sometimes there's a ghost in the machine's electronics (cruise control sometimes works, sometimes doesn't). It has that annoying steering column problem these models have ($1300 to fix it, no thanks) that squeaks and clunks. The company should do a recall as I refuse to pay that much to fix it. Visibility is poor as the A, B and C pillars are thick (due to the 4 door cab plus configuration). It gets crappy mpg which is weird as the engine purrs along at only 2500 rpm on the highway (16-18mpg highway, 8-12 city). Quiet and easy to drive. I'd buy another because of the excellent used pricing and it has held its value since I purchased it in 2012. Well my dept is paid off so we'll see if I decide to keep it. Looking at Honda Ridgelines but boy are they pricey. I'd recommend the Duro Cross model, which is what I have.

Maybe a five or six speed auto would have made that better."

The timid sounding Raider opened WIDE! I also put a k&n filter on it, 33-2175. It costs about $40 for the k&n. Shortly after instaliing the goodies, the performance probably jumped easily 20-25 h.p.  So forget about the bigger h.p. Dakota or even the more h.p. V6 Tacoma and Frontier. Because the bottom line is that torque=power and the Raider beats them both stock. And do a mod or two and you'll smoke 'em. I contacted Hypertech about a power programmer also. I can't wait!  Another 25-30 horses await. But the bottom line is that you see a Tacoma, Frontier and Dakota on every corner."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,D , 11/14/2005,2006 Mitsubishi Raider Duro Cross V6,5,"Apples to apples the Mitsubishi Raider is as good as any light truck that I have driven.  The lovely thing about it is that it's cheaper. I have had great results with my Raider, and I use it for everything, I have filled it with firewood, and could hardly tell the difference. Driving it I forget it is a truck, it feels like a car."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Patriot, 10/06/2006,Excellent Truck,5,"The raider is a great truck.  I wasn't sure what to expect and was hesitant at first.  I traded in a Dodge Ram 1500 for it.  The Raider is very comfortable, comes with many more extra's than the Dakota, and it has an awesome 5 year / 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  It looks awesome too. I got an LS Quad Cab 4x4, with remote mirrors, power everything, auto, V6, appearance package and only paid $20,400.  Its sticker was $27,355.  The Dakota didn't come close in price with a lot less options.  It has plenty of room in the inside and a very functional truck.  I would strongly recommend it.  Definitely take one for a test drive if you are looking for a new truck.  This is my third truck and it is by far the most comfortable and functional.  "

mitsubishi,raider,2006,RICH, 02/19/2006,My Mitsubishi Raider Duro Cross,4,"I've never drivin a pickup that rides so smoothly.  The Raider is like a Cadillac. Plus all the power is right there for you when you need it.  The only problem I find is that I can't pass a gas pump. I know its a truck but, it could do a lot better than 13 mpg. I was so surprised when I drove it for the first time. It is extremely comfortable and easy to drive.  There is no wrestling with this puppy.  Everything is very easy to work, just a fingertip away . I found the Raider by accident but I couldn't be happier.  I got mine fully loaded, 4x4 8 cyl., and the only thing that you might want to think about is the engine - do you want power or gas mileage. I love the power! Good job Mitsubishi!"
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Casey, 06/18/2007,Big Bang for your Buck!!!,4,"I have had my Raider Duro Cross for just over a year and I love everything about it. The Alpine 508w system is awesome. The handling is great. Highway gas mileage is awesome, especially when you combine a K&N air filter with a true dual exhaust system. The power is nice too. This truck is worth every penny and nobody can beat the warranty that it comes with or the price! "
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Jim Anthony, 01/25/2006,First Month of Use,2,"My 2006 Mitsubishi Raider's gas mileage during the first month and half has been terrible, approximately 13mpg. the interior is very bad, lots of plastic. The ride is okay, but has a lot of bounce and the truck likes to roll on railroad tracks and hard bumps. I would not recommend it for the serious off-road person."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Dustin, 01/03/2006,Perfect,5,"I drove almost every truck out there.  And the Mitsubishi Radier is the BEST truck available.  Its price, dependabiliy, room, comfort all get an A+.  Tell me where you can get a truck for $23,000 with a 5 year / 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty and looks and drives like this.  The Raider is the best truck on the market!  If you are considering buying a truck you would be upset if you did not at least consider this one."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Jmartin, 01/19/2006,My First Truck,4,"I was always a car guy, until I drove the Mitsubishi Raider. The ride is very smooth and quiet.  I never thought a truck could drive like a luxury car. Well done Mitsubishi! It is also very durable too."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,truck boy, 03/13/2006,Mitsubishi Raider,4,"I called many dealers and got a killer deal on my Mitsubishi Raider in Rosevile, CA. I had to get it.  As far as looks go it is the meanest looking truck out there, but the motor feels a little weak for the V6. It only has 210 HP but I need the better gas mileage. It rides like a car but feels like a truck"
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Terry Mongeon, 03/25/2006,The Truck,5,"With the loss of the Montero Sport I wanted somthing that was different and bought the truck. Its been a great ride, lots of power and with Bluetooth and satellite radio ready, I am good to go."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,SJ Navy Recruiter, 04/05/2006,Nice Truck Among All Small Trucks,4,"I told myself that I would never buy a truck ever in my life. That was until I saw the Raider. I didn't even know Mitsubishi went back to the pickup business, 'til I saw the truck at the dealer. It's a nice truck and it rides nice. Everything in it is nice. Plus it comes with a good waranty. You won't pay a dime for the scheduled maintenance. I will enjoy driving this truck for a while."

mitsubishi,raider,2006,wiseold5, 02/18/2006,Beautiful Truck,5,"I recently purchased a Mitsubishi Raider.  I must say that it has everything you would need in a truck. Styling, grace of handling, power, a roomy cab, and plenty fo comfort. "
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Hilborne, 04/19/2006,Undiscovered Jewel,5,"The Raider initially sparked my interest based on appearance only.  It looked sleek and mean.  I've had mine for two and a half months now, and I continue to feel like it was tailor made for me. It is powerful, comfortable, and just the right size for all my needs.  The compliments keep rolling in, even from complete strangers.  I have already driven it on a 2,500 mile road trip, and was surprised at how comfortable it was after sitting for 16 hours solid.  I still have yet to see another on the road though.  It seems as if the word just hasn't yet gotten out.  More people need to know about this undiscovered jewel."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Paul, 06/22/2006,Nice,4,"I bought a Mitsubishi Raider for my son who is in college.  It has a beautiful design.  I also considered the Toyota Tacoma, Chevy Colorado.  The Raider was the best for the price with more features. The rebate made it even more affordable and the warranty was a plus. My son is very tall (6'7"") and the 4 door appeared to have more room than the others.  It rides as well as my Toyota Tundra and gets better gas mileage.  I am very pleased with this vehicle."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,millerandassoc, 08/31/2006,Trucks Can Be Sweet and Pretty,4,"I have owned this truck for three very enjoyable weeks.  It is rattle-free and squeek-free.  I don't know how anyone could make a more solid truck.  Its ride is quiet and stable.  It has a better ride that the Jeep Liberty I traded in. I love the looks.  It is a truly good looking vehicle inside and out.  I am averaging 17 mpg so far, which iss pretty good for a V8 but it should be a little better.  I wish the truck was a little lighter and/or a little smaller. The side step bars are just a way to get your pants leg dirty. "
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Jim Anthony, 10/10/2006,10 Month Review,4,"This a follow-up to my one month review in January.  The gas mileage problem is better. I have close to 8,000 miles on it now. The interior still needs work done on it, as the compartment that hold the jack in is poorly designed. The plastic fender coverings are also a major problem. I had the dealer work on them twice and they still come loose or leak glue. I have been waiting for new parts now for over a month and half.  The dealer claims that this is a national backup for the parts. Would I still buy this vehicle? Yes."
mitsubishi,raider,2006,mike, 10/13/2006,Raidin',4,"I love this truck.  I have never had any vehicle that gets so many second looks and stares. It rides great, drives great, looks great, it's just an all around great truck. No other truck that I looked at could come close in price when equipped with just the basics my Raider came with. "
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Michael, 11/03/2006,A Serious Owner's Review,3,"I have had this truck for under a year. Within the first 2,000 miles after driving a 3 hour continuous ride the truck overheated - next I have been fighting with my dealer for 10 months to get the LOUD rattling of the poorly designed and poorly secured rubber bumper to be fixed.  They say it's the design and normal noise.  If I paid all this money for a MAJOR loud rattle I would have gotten a cheap used car - under a year, also the molding around the wheel flares are ALL getting unglued.  I am going to proceed with my lemon lawsuit (DO NOT PURCHASE ONE!)"
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Macflo, 11/14/2006,It is a Shame...,4,"I heard this truck will no longer be sold. Mitsubishi will stop its production. It is a shame because this Dakota makeup is the best truck I have driven in years besides the additional benefits like 5/60k warranty and lots of toys included for a very reasonable price.  I owned a '02 Dodge Dakota equipped with the same engine; when I tested the Raider the salesman told me the trucks are the same. I only needed the demo ride to know this guy was wrong, the Raider is a superior vehicle  in all areas. This 4.7 engine made by Daimler is the best in all the Chrysler/Dodge inventory. I suggest adding a K&N filter to improve gas mileage and wow you will see the acceleration. Take care not burn too much rubber. "
mitsubishi,raider,2006,Bree, 06/15/2007,Nice Ride to an extent!,3,"This is a pleasant truck for the family to ride pretty comfortably in. The back seat is pretty roomy. Interior is black and shows up anything, which isn't good with a baby. But its design and styling are good.  There is some suspicious engine noise that my husband says is not good. We are getting rid of this vehicle soon hopefully."
mitsubishi,raider,2007,tmac, 03/09/2008,Raider Review,4,"Great truck for the money, excellent ride, and a lot of head, and leg room. Great warranty, nice six speed! Nice body features. Gas mileage a bit costly, but now days what isn't?"
mitsubishi,raider,2007,lajestut, 09/30/2009,Good deal,3,"Just bought the truck.  Was looking for value, and found it in this truck.  Original MSRP was $29.5K, but I bought mine for $13.2K, with only 21,000 miles on the odo.  Lucky to have found this one.  Used Dakotas are selling for more.  I guess not too many are aware of this truck.  If you're in the market for a Dakota, definitely look at the Mitsu.  It's the same truck underneath.  By the way, checking the internet is the way to go.  My truck was stickered on the lot for $17.9K."

mitsubishi,raider,2007,james2468, 08/11/2010,Good truck inexperienced service,4,"INQUIRY DETAILS I have a 2007 Raider extended cab trouble free for so far, 81,000 miles. It's like a Dakota but only 3/4 of the cost and a bit more style.The V6 does not have a lot of power for towing but it sure uses a lot less gas than my F150 did. Quiet and stable on the highway, good trade off between load carrying and ride. I would buy another one. The only thing I would change is the factory Goodyear tires wore out fast and had poor traction in the rain and snow.  This truck is basically a dodge underneath and the Mitsubishi dealership knows not much about them. When the truck has 17,000 miles they recommended that the transmission would need some work on warranty."
mitsubishi,raider,2007,Gil, 04/17/2008,2007 Raider,4,Great truck for the price. The only complaint I have is that it has some road noise. Other than that I love it.
mitsubishi,raider,2007,RicZ, 11/17/2008,Great Price - Great Performance,4,"I bought the 2007 truck one year ago.  I have never regretted it. What attracted me to this truck was the value.  I compared all other 4 door trucks - none came close to the price.  The nearest truck in its class was $8k more.  Other than the Sirius radio, nothing fancy.  Good fit and finish. Cloth seats are comfortable.  Smooth and quiet ride.  The low gear ratio gives it a gutsy feel.  The 6 cylinders make the engine responsive - not enough to burn rubber, but confident to pass on the highway. The only downside is the gas mileage - not bad, but not good either.  I average around 16-17 in the city and about 18-20 on the highway.  Overall, I'm very happy with the performance.  "
mitsubishi,raider,2007,Rik, 12/04/2009,2007 Raider 4WD Double Cab (3.7),3,I've now had this truck for over two years and have used it both as a truck and for transportation.  I've had no problems with it. As a matter of fact it is a well built truck with a great design inside and out.  I would like a bit more performance (power and fuel economy) and recently installed the K&N filter.  I'm curious if adding a performance cat back system would help.
mitsubishi,raider,2007,frank, 03/15/2008,Great in the V8,4,"I absolutely love the Mitsu.  I have had it 7 months and already have over 12,000 on the odo.  I haul my boat and trailer with ease and haul cargo around pretty nimbly.  It is a great truck to work in or style in, especially if you don't want the hassle of trying to drive around and park in a full size pickup."
mitsubishi,raider,2007,WorldBeFree321, 08/21/2010,After 3 Years,3,"I have had my Raider truck now for exactly 3 years, I have grown attached to it by now.  Last year the lights on the dash went out and the dealer had to replace the entire gadget board.  Then about 3 months ago the steering locked, the chip on the key was not longer being recognized by the computer and the steering column had to be removed.  It was not the chip on the key it was the computer ion the steering.  The worst part is that the Mitsubishi dealer in Fresno, went out of business and closed and the nearest dealer is now about 30 minutes away.  I still love my truck, but I probably would get a different truck because of all the trouble that I had with this one."
mitsubishi,raider,2007,Jennelle, 05/08/2007,Awesome Truck!,4,"I've owned my 2007 Raider since Jan of 07. I love it, trans. a little rough, brakes a little shaky. Those are my only complaints, oh and fuel mileage. For the price and having it loaded with extras I can't complain too much. I compare it to Toyota as that's all I would own other than Mits. for truck purposes."

It's cool Mitsu stylin inside and out. The SE Value Package has the 6500 lb towing capacity I need for my trailer and the right blend of interior power/comfort/electronics features inside for my daily commute. If you need a big but nimble midsize to tow with and were waiting for the right price like I was, find a Raider SE."
mitsubishi,raider,2007,Elwood, 04/07/2019,Disappointing,3,"3.7 v6, 6 speed manual. It's the only (seemingly) close ratio, long handled,6 speed bolted to a painfully under powered (yet terribly inefficient) engine in a 1/2 ton pick up, I've ever come across. Unless it was being towed, 16 mpg hwy is about as good as it gets. In hot weather (100 daily where I live) fuel efficiency fades even worse. The speed limit is 80 here, but it wouldn't stay there, and at 11mpg, I quit trying. (My 71 Buick with a 7 ltr engine got 13). Had it checked out repeatedly, and other than spark plugs (normal maintenance) the diagnosis was the same each time.. ""loose nut on the steering wheel"", for expecting more. I drive A LOT for work (50K a year). I'm definitely getting something ""economical"" next.. like a Suburban, or an antique Rivera. It's a great concept, but the engineering just isn't there. Heaviest load it has carried for me was groceries for a week. A/C evaporator absolutely floods the passenger side floor until you do the sealant mods on the firewall under the hood, passenger side, between the firewall and the right bank converter. (It's a job). 153,000 miles, 3 clutches (throwout bearing each time), 3 batteries, tail shaft seal, and pinion seal. It's gotta be a heat issue, and since I'm not an automotive design engineer, I'm going to buy a truck that had engineers on staff when it was built. Update almost a year later-I guess all I had to do was talk a bunch smack about it, because it’s been fine ever since, but hwy mpg is still embarrassingly low and painful at 75-80 mph=11-13 mpg. Those are normal freeway speeds where I live. When you’re  driving a truck that gets 11mpg hwy, that truck needs to be a 4wd, 1 ton, long bed dually, with a 7.5 or 8 ltr engine upfront. It gets 16 in the city, no problem, but it clearly doesn’t have enough torque in normal operating rpm range (2k to 2300) to push the box through the air on high speed limit freeways.

The look & style caught my attention as well as the price, but don't get e wrong looks aren't everything. The truck is durable from impact don't get me wrong, I was in a big car accident, & even through the crash was big, my car came out the barely damaged. On the other hand the other suv was a total loss. Performance is what lacks mostly. Worst truck to go to the mountains. Going uphill took a lot of power & a full tank of gas, as well on the freeway the truck takes a long time to get to the speed limit & a struggle to maintain. The only faults on interior is that the center console tend to break easily."

I have had mine for 9 months and I love everything about it.  The Handling is awesome especially on curves.  When I drive it if feels like a truck but it has the comfort of a car.  The stereo system is among the best for standard equipment, mine came with free satellite radio for a year.  The manufactures warranty is also among the best in the market.  My kids and I love the room inside the double cab.  We have taken it to the coast several times and have has lost of fun.  The only thing I would trade is the MPG but hey, its a truck.  If you are thinking about getting a truck take a look at the Raider."

mitsubishi,raider,2007,David T, 08/30/2007,Returning to an Old Friend,4,"The last truck I owned was a 1997 Dodge Dakota.  I was in the market to buy one again, the size always seemed perfect, but I don't like the styling of the new Dakota.  So I took a look at the Raider, which is its structural twin, even assembled at the same plant.  The handling has been improved vastly, and the new version is even lighter then my previous.  1997 Dakota weighed in at 5,480 lbs w/ V-8 & std. cab and Raider is 4,287 lbs w/ V-6 and extended cab.  Being 1,200 lbs lighter and only 20 HP short of my last, it accelerated very nice, and the economy is better, although like all of us I'd like to see it a little better.  Maybe they can bring the 5-speed auto to the V-6 next year."
mitsubishi,raider,2007,Eire, 02/24/2009,07 Raider SE 4.7L V-8,4,Was looking for a Dakota but like others did not like the new front end. After looking at other mid size trucks and comparing the prices decide to go with this one.  Love the V-8 and get the same mpg as a V-6 is great. Has good power and the truck rides great. Interior is comfortable and the kids love all the room they have in the back. 
mitsubishi,raider,2007,Disappointed, 07/03/2010,Disappointed,3,I had always been an avid  proponent of Nissan but thought this looked like a good deal.  And it was for the first 2 years or so.  Then it was one mechanical problem after another.  First was the cam sensor.  Replaced it twice.  Then the catalytic converter broke and had to replace it. Then it wouldn't go into reverse and replaced the rear torque converter and other things.  Then the front pump seal went.  That's when I called it quits. The worst part about it was I loved everything else about the truck.  Even with the full warranty coverage I was tried of taking it in for repairs that took a minimum of 3 days and being left carless.  So traded it in for a used Toyota 4runner. 
mitsubishi,raider,2007,IMDHulk, 02/19/2007,"So Far, I Love It!",4,"To anyone out there who is not sure about the Raider...I am a believer in it! I have come across a few bad reports of Raiders but for me, overall it's the baddest truck on my block for sure! It has handsome styling, a smooth ride, and a nice sound system.  It's everything that I was looking for and the price was decent for me also. I got it for $23,000 with a lot of extras on it.

mitsubishi,raider,2008,DWilder, 05/10/2008,Not What I Expected,2,"Have had the truck just over a month and fuel mileage is not what I expected. Have been told it will get more after some break in, but don't really believe that. Thought I'd get at least 24 on the highway but struggles to get 20. Take off power from dead stand still really slow. Transmission a little clunky. Traded in a 98 Ford F150 and got a pretty good deal but not much improvement on gas mileage. Truck does have nice body and does ride better on rougher roads. Interior features are OK. Like the white background speedometer panel. Has pretty nice interior room. Wished I had looked around some more since fuel prices are so high now and looked at something with better fuel mileage."
mitsubishi,raider,2008,1truck, 05/18/2008,First truck,4,This is my first truck and I like it.  So as for the mileage still trying to get a handle on it but it seems to be around 17 or 18 in town.  I thought the 40/20/40 bench seat would be awful but it surprised me and makes you believe that you have bucket seats.  Like the storage in the armrest.  So far I am happy with it and it looks good.
mitsubishi,raider,2008,Tim, 03/15/2009,3 years and Still Awesome,4,"I purchased my raider in 2006 brand new and after a while I took it upon myself to improve the fuel economy by installing a cold air intake kit that brought me up to getting as much as 24 mpg on the highway and about 19 in the city. The ride is great and comfortable, she's fun to drive and I am going to upgrade it with more parts to help make her more fuel efficient and fun to drive by switching to a performance exhaust and higher performance spark plugs and cables which will be an inexpensive yet effective upgrade. I look forward to many more years of driving my Raider."

mitsubishi,raider,2008,Mary T, 02/14/2019,Was my 1st truck and i still own it,3,"I first bought it in nov 2008. I elected to get the 4x2, but regret not spending the extra $3k in order to get the 4x4 b/c of where i now live. Comes with great tires (Goodyear wrangler) which i got a lot of life out of (at least 6-7yrs worth, down to 2/32 before i replaced them). This truck does NOT have traction control. Mine came bumper to bumper 3yr/36, 5yr/100k, and then 10yr on something else - i forget what exactly. I’ve had the truck for 11years and still currently own it. I have 117,000 miles on it currently. I’ve not had any issues w/ the engine or the tranny. Obviously owning the truck while under warranty the first few years, life is great. You’re mostly doing general maintenance - oil changes every 3k-3500 miles, and replacing brake pads. I off-roaded in this truck - that was FUN - but i got stuck lots due to it being a 4x2. My major repairs seemed to start coming around when the majority of warranty expired, b/t 60k-85k. I always regularly maintained it, but i noticed at that mark, i was starting to go thru wheel bearings a lot and i don’t drive it hard either. In the 11yrs i’ve owned it, I’ve done both back bearings once and replaced the front ones at least 6-8+ times. I also replaced brakes/rotors at least 3-4 times (can’t remember the exact mileage mark but it was b/t 60k-100k). Replaced a driveshaft or camshaft bearing when it was around 82k - not sure that happened. Corporate says O2 sensors never fail, but due to a dishonest garage, i had to replace mine around the 85k mark as well as the computer since they fried it (the pc was covered under emissions though). After 100k miles i’ve had to replace a couple tranny lines, a brake line, both calipers at least once (front brakes locked on me may 2018), just replaced another front right caliper a few days ago (as it was leaking brake fluid), another 2 front wheel bearings 3 wks ago (Jan 2018), and now at 117k i need a water pump since there is coolant leaking. This is my next upcoming repair along w/ rear brakes/drums that have been getting low since may 2018. Also due to a dishonest garage, i had to replace my rack & pinion in  Jan 2018. It’s been quite a ride. I honestly think if it wasn’t for some dishonest mech’s working on it, i prob wouldn’t have had to do the r&p, the 02 sensor or the driveshaft bearing. Imo, the body quality of the raider sucks compared to Nissan and Toyota. It dents/rusts easily. I agree that it does take a lil to get up/go on the acceleration end. It passes great when you need to pass someone though. Gas mileage is 16/20 to start, now maybe 18/22. It’s a v6. No issues w/ engine or tranny yet. Downside for most repairs on this truck, you have to replace the whole unit instead of just the part that has the problem. Bottom line, it’s not a bad truck but if you need something to tow or carry heavy loads - look elsewhere. If you just want a truck to get around town, or just to drive one, then look at this or a Subaru Baja. It’s served me well but the golden years are over and now it’s just all costly repairs that i don’t think should be manifesting themselves at the 117k mark for an ‘08. I’d think more like at the 150k-200k+ mark. I bought it cuz it was only $20k (the incentive was $10k) plus i had other discounts. I wanted a frontier, canyon, or Colorado at that time but they had horrible incentives and it was gonna cost much more. Kinda kicking myself for not getting one of those now b/c of what i’m going thru now. Considering trading in the raider for a frontier or Chevy though. Def not going w/ another mitsubishi that’s for sure.

mitsubishi,raider,2008,Art, 09/28/2009,Bought new,4,"Looks great-mileage is still improving, have only 3000 mi on it. Am getting 18 to 20 in town-no hwy. drive yet-handles great-ride is wonderful (car like). Roomy compared to my 02 Ranger XLT-if it proves as reliable as Ranger-will be terrific. Price was right. V-6 Plenty of power for me. Cruising along at 50mph results in no more than 14 to 1500rpm."
mitsubishi,raider,2008,raul, 09/29/2009,Nice pickup truck,4,"The ride is very smooth and quiet.  For the price I paid I am very happy, I really like this little truck. "
mitsubishi,raider,2008,smith, 05/07/2008,Strong truck,4,"Purchases this truck less then a month ago.  1st fill up got 19 mpg, mostly highway with ac on.  Acceleration is what I expected with a 6cyl, and the ride is very smooth, almost car like.  Owned a Colorado previously, and this truck surpasses the Chevy in every category.  Manual seat is still comfortable, and had no problem finding a good driving position.  Get many looks and compliments, plus the $5500 rebate off of the invoice didn't hurt.  Definitely do not regret this purchase.."
mitsubishi,raider,2008,fraggledrock, 06/24/2012,Most disappointing Mitsubishi,2,"I was a devoted Mitsubishi owner because my Mighty Max served me so well for 15 years & over 200K miles until it was totaled. I bought a 2008 Raider expecting the same durability & have never been so wrong! At 62K miles the Raider has major mechanical issues - bearing failure in the rear differential. To make matters worse the component isn't repairable & requires complete component replacement. Unlike most 2008 models from Mitsubishi, these units do not have a 10 year 100,000 mile power train warranty a clear statement of no confidence by the manufacturer."
mitsubishi,raider,2008,Aquawanticee, 12/02/2008,I Love My Raider,4,I have only had my truck for 1 day. I fell in love right away. My Raider  will be a farm truck and my personal ride to and from work every day. It has all the  power a sensible driver needs. I feel certain it will pull a two-horse trailer with no problem.
mitsubishi,raider,2008,Dave, 06/21/2009,Good option at a good price,4,"Although my Raider (rebadged Dakota) may not compete with some of the more refined trucks in its class, the Raider is an excellent choice for the price. The V6 provides decent power, the interior is roomy, and the features are simple to use. For the price and what I get in return, this vehicle is a good option."
mitsubishi,raider,2008,Kusch, 07/31/2009,It's a Truck??,3,"The only thing that makes this a truck is a bed and a bumper hitch!! Granted, at the time of purchase, I was looking for an SUV, after years of driving a Full Size F150. So, I settled for 50/50. I loved it, until I bought a boat. After a few months of towing on the weekends.......things started going wrong. I figured I'd save up the problems and turn it in for service and warranty at the one year mark. It's at the dealership now...and I'm waiting...and waiting...  The service and warranty are great, they just had alot of stuff to fix. Bottom line, if you want a truck, buy a truck. If you want a nice looking 4 dr, but this truck. Do not treat it like your last pick-up, as it won't last long."
mitsubishi,raider,2008,David, 04/15/2008,Just don't cut the mustard,2,"Had the truck for 3 weeks, 16 mpg no matter how you drive around town..18 on the highway.Truck seems to be solid built but extremely underpowered with the 3.7 v6. Small inside cab as an old day small import is but the outside will fool you as it appears to be a full size truck. Might as well buy a full sized Silverado or F150 concerning the gas mileage and engine size for weight ratio. Had it to do over, would not buy one with the v6 would opt for the v8- then price wise- a Silverado or Ford with a v8 would be cheaper and more comfortable inside. Feels like a 4cyl powered truck. Nice design power train leaves room for beter power to weight ration and definitely pick up-a VW bug will do it in!"
mitsubishi,raider,2008,joe, 05/05/2008,ok truck,3,"For most part, I like the truck, def. No power at all. Love setup, love the comfort and looks and love the height, I have a ram 4x4 with 3"" lift and the raider is only an inch or so shorter on height then my 3"" lifted ram, so love that. Comes with some good tires Goodyear wranglers. Rims are nice on it as well."
mitsubishi,raider,2009,Richard, 03/10/2010,Looks and options,4,"Saw the truck in the show room, had all the options and looks that I wanted in a pickup.  Drives nice overall, best on freeway with little road noise."

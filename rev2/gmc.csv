gmc,acadia-limited,2017,Dave J., 10/22/2016,My second Acadia,5,"Loved my '08 Acadia and I felt no need to change horses when it came time for replacement. So far, I have driven this only in good weather, so I can't comment at all on rain/snow driving. This model seems noticeably quieter than my 08, and seems a bit more peppy. Driving is smooth, I can't think of a thing to criticize in a major way but I have some  quibbles. The Infotainment system may have some improvements over my old system, but it doesn't seem as intuitive. For one thing, I can't figure out how to mark the location where I am sitting and if it's in the manual, show me where!  The feature was drop-dead easy in my old Acadia. The manual by the way, is poorly thought out and lacking detail. The electronics are great! Blind spot alert feature is very helpful and a must-have. Backup camera as well. Color we chose was Sparkling silver and it's gorgeous!

gmc,acadia-limited,2017,KAREN miller, 07/12/2017,Still love my Acadia,5,"Still love this car only thing is we are having problems keeping the back of the SUV cool enough for our two dogs.  We've brought it in several times regarding AC issues - seems to be the one thing about this car that is hard to resolve.  Front AC works great except for an occasional musty smell that occurs.  
"
gmc,acadia-limited,2017,Neil Birchler, 06/01/2017,A Great Vehicle at an astounding price!,5,"I owned a 2014 Acadia Denali before, but after purchasing the 2017 Acadia Limited, I find it to be every bit as good, if not better than it's predecessor.  The only thing I miss is the power tilt and telescope steering wheel. But the manually adjusted function in the 2017 Limited is easy to adjust and I'm sure it will not be any problem in the near future. The up grades to the 2017 Limited are really amazing. Wish they would have been available in the 2014 Denali, but that is the difference in 3 years of technology upgrades. I prefer the size of the Limited , as opposed to the new smaller 2017 Acadia. My wife and I just purchased our new Limited in March and drove to St Louis and back to Vero Beach, FL averaging 23 mpg. We are pleased!
After driving the Acadia Limited for 3 years now, my wife and I are both very happy with the Acadia Limited's size, and preformance. It is hands down the best car we have ever owned.
"
gmc,acadia-limited,2017,Gregor, 10/15/2017,Last Year for the Acadia Limited,4,"GMC has a great SUV with the Larger Acadia Limited.  This is the 4th Acadia we purchased in our family.  We had 3, 2014, my wife and two daughters.  Love the vehicle.  Great for hauling around our 4 grandsons, car seats fit great in the second row and large cargo space for strollers and all the stuff that goes with infants and toddlers. Not sure why GM decided to shrink the size down to that of a Ford Exployer other than maybe the Acadia had knocked the heck out of the Yukon and Tahoe sales. The older Acadias and the 2017 Acadia limited (same as older ones) had as much cargo space as the Yukon, 5000 pound towing, better fuel economy, easier to park and about $20,000 less.  This being the last year they will make the larger Acadia is why we sold the 2014 and purchased the 2017.  Hopefully this one will last for 10 plus years.  I drive a Yukon XL Denali which is great for towing and hauling, but the Acadia is a great family SUV for trips to the mall, grocery and short trips.
"
gmc,acadia-limited,2017,A Pedersen, 04/12/2017,Wow!,5,"I have only owned an Acaidia for a short time, we purchased a 2015 certified pre owned, which we love.  It needed service and we received a loaner which was a 2017 Acaidia Limited.  Both cars are amazing.  I hope that GMC doesn't  stop production of the larger size SUV.
"
gmc,acadia-limited,2017,Gemgal, 06/15/2020,My 50th Birthday Present to ME!,5,"I had admired the look of the GMC Acadia truck for over 5 years before I bought it for my 50th bday in 2018. In my 49th year, it was announced that the Acadia was going smaller in the 2017 model, but still offering the Acadia ""Limited"", the bigger model as well. GMC was phasing out the larger truck. I desperately wanted the larger truck, as I had 2 dogs, and desired more road trips.  Space was a necessity! I spent an entire year looking for ""the"" Acadia. Finally found it, and bit the bullet 5 days before my 50th. It was a fleet lease vehicle with low miles. I also negotiated a sunroof in the deal.
Lucky for me, the price was desirable. I am 2 yrs into loving this truck, more and more every day! Space, ride, safety and maintenance has all been a huge plus for me. From 2019 through 2020, I've made 4 cross country trips from beating hot desert, to rainy conditions to mountainous wintery conditions, this truck grooved along effortlessly.  
LOVE IT AND RECCOMEND IT! 
"
gmc,acadia-limited,2017,Dave, 08/10/2019,Nice,4,"Decided on the Limited primarily because the newer model had no CD player.  Is a little cumbersome but overall a nice vehicle.  No problems in snow.  I wish though, as with any car I have owned,  they would put some kind of lift retainer from the front of the passenger seat that would prevent things(groceries, CD, fast food, etc) from sliding off the seat onto the floor whenever making any kind of quick stop(deer, stop lights, pedestrians, etc.). 
"
gmc,envoy,2000,coby4, 03/07/2013,My Envoy/ Improved Jimmy,3,"I got my envoy back in 2006 for a good price of 4,790 with 119,000 miles on it. Its been very great and only had one problem with the audio controls which is getting fixed next month. The style is ok its kind of old S10 look. But the interior is amazing. Comfortable seats and wood and chrome trim makes it look nice. The ride is amazing except off-road it rock just a little. Gas mileage could a little better as well.Overall Its been a great vehicle to us."
gmc,envoy,2000,Ladystrdst, 06/18/2002,GMC Jimmy Envoy 2000,3,"Exellent vehicle, handles well, quiet 
smooth ride. This is my third Jimmy, 
previously owned a 95.  The 2000 has 
come a long way compared to the 95."
gmc,envoy,2000,DAPAR, 12/02/2002,2000 Envoy,3,"Beautiful interior /exterior, all the 
little extra's on this model made it 
seem almost too good to be true.  
Unfortunately performance hasn't been 
that great.  When I bought the vehicle 
I thought it only needed a front end 
alignment and was given $30 by 
dealership to fix, I bought it out of 
state).  I found later it really needed 
upper & lower ball joints, idler arm 
and front end alignment (cost over 
$1000).  After having it under 5 weeks 
the transmission went out... very 
disappointing. Doors also should lock 
when in motion, but don't. Temperature 
control needs improvement - doesn't 
seem to reach temperature setting 
inside vehicle."
gmc,envoy,2000,Mike, 12/07/2004,2000 GMC Envoy,4,"The 2000 GMC Envoy has good quality throughout and a very comfortable ride.  It drives more like a car than a truck.  I have not had any reliability issues in the five years and over 100,000 miles that I haev owned it."
gmc,envoy,2000,paul bauer, 07/31/2005,Love my SUV,4,"We found an Envoy that had been traded back to the dealer because it was too small for the original owner.  They bought a Suburban.  It had only 6500 miles on it.  We scored.  We love it, using it mainly for skiing.  It has been a real find."
gmc,envoy,2000,George, 12/02/2015,Jimmy #4 & I will buy more!,4,"When buying one or the Blazer Trannys & Ball Joints can be an issue around the 160k mark on the 4x4 models. Other then that pretty much good oil changes and turn key.  When I get around the 300k mile mark I usually give them to my bro and he puts another 100k.
"
gmc,envoy,2002,klr4isu, 12/06/2010,I MISS MY ENVOY,4,I bought my Envoy in 07 before gas prices went all nuts. I ended up trading it for a foreign piece of crap that now burns oil at less than 75k miles! I WANT MY ENVOY BACK!!! :(  I was actually in a pretty scary accident in the Envoy and walked away without a scratch. Did a 360 on black ice going up a hill (didn't have 4WD on because I didn't think it was slick out). The Envoy had some pretty bad body damage but was 100% by the time my body shop guy got done with it and it ran like a dream the entire time I had it. Only issue was a fan belt (I think that's what it was called) that needed replaced for $400. Sounded like I was driving a semi when it went out! :)
gmc,envoy,2002,khill23, 04/06/2014,High Mileage Envoy,3,"I have a 2002 GMC Envoy with 270,000 miles. I have had for 4 years and have had no major problems with the motor or tranny. I have had to replace the valve cover gasket, rack and pinion steering, ignition coil packs, front hub assembly on both sides, windshield wiper motor, rear shocks, air shocks (once and the second time I put on springs), air compressor, starter, and water pump. However, those go out on most makes around 200,000 miles I would assume. the four wheel drive was awesome for one bad winter, but has recently stopped working electrical problem or actuator switch I am guessing ,So I would have to say for 270,000 miles and having no engine or tranny problems I cant complain."
gmc,envoy,2002,swkntexas, 06/25/2011,"Very, very dependable!",4,"I am the second owner of my 2002 Envoy.
Bought it in 2006 with 52k miles.
It presently has 110k and had never once needed repairs.
I've had to replace the battery and tires, but those are expected repairs.
Yesterday, I took it in for the 90k service and also requested a complete check of all parts, engine and otherwise.
The original rotors and brake pads were due for replacement - but, I was told they could last another 2,000 miles.
The serpentine belt had minor cracks, and was told it would last a few thousand more miles.
Needless to say, I replaced all that was found after looking at the old parts myself.
After 110k there have been no major mechanical problems. Very impressed."
gmc,envoy,2002,kww8732, 08/08/2009,Reliable,4,I've never had any problems with this vehicle with the exception of several minor recalls.  I've been very happy with this SUV.  Have averaged about 17 miles/gallon of mixed driving with 16 in the city and 21 on the highway.
gmc,envoy,2002,Benjamin, 02/12/2016,Benjamin Iowa State,5,"Attractive features: 

This 2002 GMC envoy (blue) with just less than 150,000 miles and 270-horse power has several features which drivers of all ages would find appealing. This vehicle includes 5 available seats, 2 front heated seats, an automatic transmission, and a 6-cylinder engine that offers a quiet and comfortable ride. The dash interior comes with a stock CD changer; two power outlets, no sunroof included in the specific model, but does come included with power-adjustable seats.  

Review: 

I have no problem giving this vehicle five stars out of five stars. This early 2000’s model gives back seat riders a great amount of legroom, and is a wonderful vehicle to take the whole family in on long car rides. In between the two front seats there’s two cup holders. The back seat also includes two pull down cup holders that will hold any size cup or drink. 
I purchased this SUV with just over 100,000 miles on it and I’ve never purchased a more reliable vehicle. This vehicle has never been in an accident and does have two dents in the rear trunk door; otherwise there is no cosmetic damage. The SUV comes with a ball and hitch and is very good for towing. When not towing, this vehicle will get around 22 miles to the gallon. When towing, depending on the size of your load, the vehicle can get anywhere from 13 to 18 miles per gallon. The four-wheel drive comes in very handy if you live in an area where it snows in the winter and even without the four-wheel drive on, it does pretty well in snow. The size of this vehicle is smaller than your standard pickup truck, yet big enough to haul a trailer or small family with room to spare. The back seats fold down to allow the entire trunk to become open which you can use to transport numerous items that wouldn’t fit otherwise. 
Many consumers worry that the SUV is a 6 cylinder and not a V-8. In my opinion, the 6 cylinder has enough power and as a result, produces an extremely smooth ride. The main console is a bit undersized but the vehicle has no other major inconveniences. Although this model was discontinued in 2009, I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase another one with less mileage on it.

gmc,envoy,2002,chris, 08/02/2009,easy now,4,"Love the GMC Envoy. 02' couple of things! great seating, comfy ride, Bas location was the cup holders in front passengers and the rearview mirror,  Had to replace all ball joints, and bushings, now the water pump needs replaced,  Also the mirrors make a whistling noise when driving. Other than that vehicle is great.. routine maintenance is all that's had to be done. no major engine problems. knock on wood.. "
gmc,envoy,2002,Debbie, 07/08/2007,Can't beat it!,4,"Going from a Acura sports car, to a GMC Envoy, I was impressed. Both had the power and comfort I needed and enjoy. The kids like that they can listen to their own music from the back, when they forget to bring something along for the journey.  It's very open and roomy  I don't feel closed in like some SUV's. I don't have a blind spots, and the sunroof is perfect for more openness. Testing other mid size SUV's, I'm happy to say.... this was a perfect choice.  "
gmc,envoy,2002,Dick, 07/22/2008,Great SUV 2003 GMC Envoy,4,"Best vehicle I've ever owned, it now has 135,000 miles on it. The brakes and tires have lasted more than 60,000 miles, I'm on my second set of each now. The only thing I've had to replace is the water pump at 120,000 miles, not bad at all. I get 16 to 18 mpg city and up to 24 mpg on the highway. It's a very comfortable ride and a very useful vehicle. I will buy another one when or if it finally gives up."
gmc,envoy,2002,mommyof2boys, 02/18/2009,This vehicle saved our lives,4,"We bought our Envoy when I was expecting our 2nd child. I am so thankful we did. In December of this past year we were in an accident.  My Envoy was totaled but we all survived.  My 4 year old had to have 3 stitches above his eye and my 7 year old walked away without a scratch.  I had internal bruising from the airbag. We hit at 50MPH. It was a front impact then the other car spun around hitting my 4 year old directly in his door. This vehicle crumbled, but the inside structure stayed perfectly intact. Only 1 door would open. It was a bad wreck. We knew we wanted another vehicle like this and searched until we decided on an 06 Trailblazer EXT. I pray it's as good as the Envoy.  "
gmc,envoy,2002,emelton, 03/23/2010,Nothing but problems,3,I have a 2002 Envoy SLT beautiful with all the bells and whistles. I have had nothing but problems since I purchased the truck in 2004 with 30k miles. It has been at the dealership 18 times in the last 3 years. I am finally getting it fixed for the last time to trade it off. So many problems too many to mention. It has been a money pit for me.
gmc,envoy,2002,Ed, 08/14/2008,So far so good,4,"I bought a 2002 Envoy SLT at 93K miles. So far I've put 3K miles on it and have been very pleased. I use it mainly for towing a travel trailer and with the powerful V6 it does a good job. Interior is great, very comfy leather seats and I love the stereo. The ride is smooth and great acceleration.  Gas mileage (without towing) is surprisngly good too. Highway only driving is about 22MPG, city about 15. Not great but not bad for a powerful SUV. I was hesitant to buy a used GM vehicle. But so far after 3 months and 3K miles driven, I'm happy with the purchase."
gmc,envoy,2002,Laura, 08/25/2008,Buy the Extended Waranty,3,"First off this Envoy was the upgraded Denali version, which right off, was alittle more added to the price tag. I just traded this in after 3 years, and within this past year I had to have 3 tie rod ends, yes that is 3. Why do you ask, because I needed another ""knuckle"" replaced at 88,000. The first one was replaced at 47,000 just before my warranty ran out. The leather seats started to ""wear off"" at 15,000. This vehicle was in the dealership so much, they knew me by name. The dealer also never heard of replacing the knuckle, again, until they met me. I was getting about 20 mpg which isn't bad, and it never left me stranded. I just feel this truck had way too many issues for the money"
gmc,envoy,2002,Seadog, 04/11/2002,I Like it,4,"Great SUV, one of the best I have ever 
owned."
gmc,envoy,2002,dingo6120, 02/14/2008,Best Vehicle Investment I've Made,4,"I purchased this vehicle when there were no others on the road.  I was 1st impressed with its individual styling.  Very soon after I was delighted with its interior appointments and comfort.  I now have 125,000 miles and still no mechanical issues what-so-ever!  This SUV (other than gas) has been the most inexpensive vehicle 2 own.  I am not even close to looking 4 another SUV because most, even 5yrs later, are not as well appointed as mine.  Neither do they have the comfort I am used to.  The power I get from this inline V6 is remarkably strong.  I can drive in any situation w/confidence enough to lead the pack if the law would let me. I hope to keep my great looking GMC 4 another few year"
gmc,envoy,2002,mike288, 11/22/2003,Lemon,2,"I bought in June 2001. One of the 
first of a new model. Bad idea... Have 
had many problems in the shop many 
times... A/C still doesn't work right. 
Cools great when moving but if i'm 
stopped i.e. traffic, light etc. it 
stops cooling. Brutal in Boston 
traffic in the summer! Poor quality 
workmanship... Does look nice though 
but now that it's out of warranty I'm 
getting rid of it. Oh one of the other 
many problems is t he mirrors they 
never worked right even after to new 
motors.. memory!"
gmc,envoy,2002,beachbun, 02/20/2004,Needs alot of work,2,"If i had read the reviews before hand 
I would never got one. The engine blew 
at 7000 miles and continued to give me 
problems after being replaced. The ses 
light is always on with the reduced 
power light on also. The transmission 
blew at 18000 miles and was 
replaced.The car has been in the shop 
over 50 days.I am in the process of 
trying to get GM to buy back the car. 
Never another ENVOY.Its just one thing 
after another the rear window has 
leaked since my purchase and has been 
replaced.Many other problems also but 
I don't have enough space. GM should 
fix problems not run from them as they 
have."
gmc,envoy,2002,driver48, 11/27/2004,GMC Envoy Minor Annoyances,3,"The electronics on the GMC Envoy are 
not to be trusted.  I have had two 
warranty repairs of the electronic 
dashbord.  The mirrors have been never 
been right.  I have had them in five 
times an the ""curb view"" still does 
not work correctly."
gmc,envoy,2002,Maryland, 07/30/2007,A long 5 years,3,"I bought this in late 2002 new with a custom Denali grille. I had to choose between the Envoy, Acura MDX and Honda Pilot. I decided I did not want to buy that Asian rubbish and went for the Envoy. At 4500 miles I had severe engine failure. I needed a rental for four months. After that, everything was fine. On premium gas all I was got 11mpg! The interior is not that functional especially the seatbelts. Windnoise is tremendous. Ride is very comfortable though. I would not consider it a bad experience, I would gladly take this over an Asian car. I finally traded it in for a BMW X3 which is also a great car."
gmc,envoy,2002,mike h. , 12/18/2007,2002 GMC Envoy SLT,4,"This is a big, nice riding, nice handling, very comfortable vehicle. The leather seats are plush, and the climiate control features are easy to use and nice. My wife loves the heated seats in the winter. You sit up high and can see very well out of all windows in this truck. Problems, well it has the famous GMC Envoy piston slap...tick, tick, tick..when you start it up. Espeically annoying noise in the winter when the noise is louder. Also make sure you own a gas station before buying an Envoy. 12- 14 mpg/city if you are lucky."
gmc,envoy,2002,Bubba692007, 07/14/2007,GMC's Number 1,4,"I purchased my Envoy two years ago and am totally in love with it. I keep up with the maintenance myself at home. I have yet to have a problem with it. It has been a totally reliable vehicle for me and my family. In two years I have not had to fix anything on it other than a door that was damaged in an accident. It rides like a dream and is very comfortable for me, my wife and daughter. The amount of room in it is for the most part more than we need. I can see still having enough room if we were to have another child as well. I am a die hard GM fan, its in my blood  and the Envoy has reassured me that i will always ride with GM products. It is well worth the money."
gmc,envoy,2002,John Chang, 07/05/2002,Credit where it's due,4,"First off, Edmunds has an axe to grind 
against GM, and I can't fathom their 
poor review of this vehicle.  This is a 
superb vehicle, and compares well 
against the truck-based and cross-over 
midsize SUVs.  It looks sharp outside, 
drives strongly and smoothly and 
securely, and has a great looking 
interior.  I have put on 11,000 miles 
in less than 5 months, and I have no 
reliability problems with this 
vehicle."
gmc,envoy,2002,bigtalllefty, 09/12/2002,"So far, so good",4,"After 11 months of ownership, 
complaints are minor.  Top of seat back 
is too low for 6'5"" driver.  With tilt 
steering wheel in comfortable position, 
can't read speedometer (blocked by top 
of steering wheel).  Initially, fuel 
economy was horrid; improved to 
reasonably close to EPA ratings after a 
few thousand miles.  CD/cassette stereo 
and limited slip only options on our 
Envoy.  No mechanical problems.  Don't 
break a fancy headlight: cost a fortune 
to replace!  Oil changes are expensive: 
SEVEN quarts of oil!"

can not fix."
gmc,envoy,2002,Tom Simon, 07/30/2003,Don't Make My Mistake,2,"I like the styling & handeling of the

Maverick. I've had more things

We sold it due to an overseas job transfer but we're returning in July '06 and have already contacted the dealer to get another one.  We had some trouble with the A/C however, the dealer fixed it pretty quickly. With the current high fuel costs, I'll get a REAL good deal this year. The '02 SLT was nimble and quick. We averaged 18mpg over 2 years.  Not too terrible for a 275hp truck but always room to improve. "

Skiing in the winter, getting to trail 
heads in the summer. Totally 
dependable after 2 years & 23k.

standing behind their prod. I also had 
a faulty seal on the windshield  and a 
kinked gas line. There has also been 
other problems and the list goes on and

gmc,envoy,2002,vhanek, 11/29/2004,"Never, ever again",3,"Thanks to my cheap mentality I was 
looking for cheap, nice, quality SUV. 
I purchased used 2002 GMC Envoy with 50,000 
miles on it for ""only"" $17,000. What a 
mistake! This truck has terrible wind noise around 
its doors.  It literally souds like driving 
with an open window.  The wipers don't 
work well in cold weather. The heat stops 
working from time to time. The engine 
makes unhealty noises.  The memory mirrors  
never go back to their set positions.  The heated mirror
function does not work.  I get a maximum of 18 
mpg on the highways.  This truck is vibrating at 
highway speeds. I've only had it for a few months and
I an already looking to sell it even if I have to lose money.
If you read this review because you are considering 
buying one, please, think again."
gmc,envoy,2002,K Cooper, 08/08/2005,Envoy Nightmare,3,"I have had my Envoy since Oct. of 2002 and now have just under 50,000 miles on it.  I love the way it looks, rides and performs, however I have had way too many problems to list.  Engine failure at 5,500 miles, transmission at 48K along with the rear differential.  GM has covered most of the repair costs but the down time and reliability isn't good.  Hopefully they have worked out the bugs for the 05's and 06's. "
gmc,envoy,2002,cyberjax21, 08/20/2005,2002 GMC Envoy,4,"I've truly enjoyed my Envoy. It's true as they say ""It's not more than you need, just more than your used to"". For the first few months I didn't even realize it had a built in air compressor with hose. The comfort factor is amazing, it rides just like a car thanks to the air ride suspension. The power is great! I've had just 2 problems with the vehicle. The 4 wheel drive kept automatically shifting itself into geer. We went through 3 tries at the dealership until it was fixed. The 2nd problem was that the air compressor went out on my first use. Since it's been replaced neither problems have reoccured."
gmc,envoy,2002,ThumbsUp, 04/23/2003,Edmonds Doesn't Get It,5,"It is strange that the review put forth 
by Edmonds for the 2002 Envoy was 
replete with accolades for design, 
performance, comfort, style, etc. 
Indeed, it was most deserving of the 
2002 SUV of the year award.  Their 
review for the same vehicle in 2003 
seems to indicate that it is a much 
lesser product. Apparently the minor 
change to the taillight and a 5 HP 
increase destroyed their vision for 
2003.

Also contrary to Edmonds opinion, I 
have had a number of favorable comments 
on the leather interior.

Guess I am just too easy to please."
gmc,envoy,2002,goingforeign, 12/17/2007,6 years $6k in repairs,2,"This vehicle was excellent over the first 100k miles.  After which, I've had to replace the transfer case at a total cost of $1500. The airbag system failed due to a faulty modulator & master control switch and is $1400 to replace. I'm now at 205,000 miles and have to get the rear differential rebuilt for a cool $1700, along with a failed control module adding another $700. All of this combined with several other trim and mechanical failures have me up in arms. I might as well have a car payment with as much as this is costing in repairs. I drive the heck out of this vehicle, but have the fluids checked/replaced on a monthly basis along with other scheduled/required maintenance. This stinks."
gmc,envoy,2002,Citizen Z, 07/18/2016,"Junk, plain and simple, AVOID THEM.",1,"This is a classic ""throw away"" vehicle, it is not built to last longer than the factory warranty period. When it does have a failure it is always Major and cost a fortune to fix. With 150,000 it needs a new engine, the VVT solenoid and sprocket have both been replaced, the oil pressure sending unit has been replaced (it still will not hold oil pressure at idle), the oil pan seal (silicon, no gasket) is a $500 repair, the valve cover gasket is a $400 repair, front wheel bearings fail every 50,000 miles and are a $500 job, the transmission slams into gear after coasting for a bit which makes me suspect that it is failing too. It averages 8-13 miles per gallon, which is beyond a gas guzzler. The check engine light is always on for something different(not a ""loose gas cap"") and the cruise control will not work if the check engine light is on. It rattles, creaks, pops, squeaks, and has major major wind noise. Fix one thing, and something else fails within a couple of weeks.

the clock resets and the engine was 
roaring and the car would NOT 
accelerate. Decreased Engine

11/2002.  It has made over 12 visits to 
my local dealer in a year.  My memory 
mirrors, never remember.  My seat tried 
to kill me by going fully forward while 
I was driving. There is a constant 
squeak coming form the dash, exterior 
temperature sensor broke, rear wiper 
and defroster broke, I could go on.
I will never, give another GM car a 
chance to make me bitter.  $35,000 and 
it can't stay out of the shop for 30 
days.  Also, what gives with the 
horrible road holding performance?  
This thing handles like a wet pig.
Honestly, I fully regret purchasing 
this automobile, and will probably not 
own it for much longer."
gmc,envoy,2002,JayDee, 02/19/2003,No regrets,4,"I traded in a Ford Expedition for the 
Envoy - no regrets.  The Envoy rides 
great, is the right size, and is much 
more comfortable on long trips.  We 
haul lots of ""stuff"" and a 
big labrador in the back, and have 
plenty of room.  Unlike some other 
reviews, I am getting 
23 mpg on the highway at 75 mph, 
compared to 16 mpg for the Expedition.  
For a 4000 lb. plus car, that's not too 
bad.  So far, no problems with the 
car.  I do think GM builds a ""looser"" 
car than Ford or Chrysler, which I 
think are ""tighter"".  But I had GM 
products before, so was aware of that 
up front.  All in all, we really like 
our Envoy, and would recommend it to 
others."

Expedition.  But I do have a lot of 
trunk space now.  I get a lot of 
compliments on the look of my Envoy.  I 
also love driving with the sunroof 
open, the Bose stereo on and the 
woodgrain look accents and the leather

WITH KIDS!!!:) THIS CAR IS GREA AND I 
HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH IT.."
gmc,envoy,2002,JAY, 06/24/2007,Nice vehicle,4,It has been a reliable and especially comfortable vehicle for me. You could not ask for more options with the SLT package.
gmc,envoy,2002,driver, 08/14/2007,Best I have owned,4,"Overall, very satisfied. I travel a lot on business and put 25-30 thousand miles a year on my car.  Biggest problems: replaced compressor at 60K miles and at 90K a brake caliper fell off and damaged the rim. No complaints otherwise. It is the most comfortable and smoothest ride I have owned, surpassing my '93 Buick Lesabre. With 4WD it will go anywher I need it to go in any weather. And the versatility of an SUV body is great.  Good sound system and A/C. Good driver visibility."
gmc,envoy,2002,Jenvoy03, 04/29/2003,"Very Comfortable SUV, car like ride",4,"Its a big vehicle but drives like a 
car. I have had Ford Explorers a 94. 
and 97 and they were very truck like. 
GM always have seats that I feel are 
very comfortable and this SUV is no 
exception. I have the SLT 2 wheel 
drive, with running boards, sun roof, 
side air bags, Bose system. Big roomy 
vehicle. I came out of a 2003 Acura TL 
type S, I figured out I wasn't the 
sports car type plus I found the TL 
lacking in quality contrary to their 
reputation. The GMC seems to have 
built very well. My only problems so 
far was chattering wiper blades, 
dealer replaced under warranty, and a 
defective switch in A/C that caused it 
to work intermittenly. Dealer fixed."
gmc,envoy,2002,gtb32, 05/11/2003,my toy envoy,4,"    iv always drive sedans ,this is
my first time in suv ,so its been almost
two year""s this june.  love to drive it
im retired and take all over town.so
let me say love to drive ."
gmc,envoy,2002,Hornedfrog, 05/15/2003,Best Ride So Far,4,"I have owned many types of automobiles. 
68 Corvette Convertible, 91 Lincoln 
Continental, 93 Toyota Camry V6, and I 
traded a 99 Jimmy SLT in for the 
Envoy.  This is the best ride I have 
ever experienced.  The Engine is strong 
across the band width and quite.  The 
ride is as smooth if not smoother then 
the Continental and it has a turn 
radius so small (my wifes Rav 4 does 
not turn as tight) it is scary.  The 
only complaint I have is the fuel tank 
size and I wished I had waited for the 
XL for the extra people hauling.  I 
have not had one problem and believe it 
or not, not a single GM rattle has 
popped up. So far this SUV has been 
flawless.  "
gmc,envoy,2002,Seadog, 01/29/2003,Nice Drive but..........,3,"Since purchasing our 2002 Envoy over 14 
months ago, I would say it has been a 
pleasure to drive.The only thing I 
don't really care for is the computer 
controls on the steering wheel.

BUT, the quality and break downs have 
been more than one would expect. I have 
had my Envoy in the dealership to 
replace the following failed items.
1. Rear air suspension
2. Front bumper brackets
3. Memory module for seats and mirrors
4. 4 wheel drive module
5. Horn

I am still waiting for some more parts 
to come in for some of these repairs. I 
plan to sell or trade in my Envoy as 
soon as these are fixed."
gmc,envoy,2002,a name, 01/17/2003,Good Start,4,"The Envoy was my choice because of 
comfort and ride. I owned a 1993 Ford 
Exporer but the 2002 Explorers had hard 
seats and a rough ride. Also I didn't 
like the 3 bucket rear seat the came 
out with. I was very happy with my 1993 
Explorer but Ford needs to address 
comfort with the new Explores.

My disapointments with the Envoy are,
When you put the back seat down you 
can't but the front seat back the way I 
like to ride.
Had rattles, and I don't like the rain 
sensitive windshild wipers. I also 
don't like the auto dimming rear view 
mirror.
The cargo space is also smaller than 
the explorer was.
Sound proofing is also disapointing"
gmc,envoy,2002,Bernard Gonda, 01/19/2003,Best SUV I've had yet,4,"I have had MPVs, Blazers, and Explorers 
but nothing matches the ride I get from 
this SUV. My wife and I prefer to 
travel in it over our Bonneville.

I have only had one problem with it. 
Recently the load levelers failed 
because the check valve on the 
compressor broke. This was remedied by 
the dealer in 4 hours."
gmc,envoy,2002,Envoy_User, 03/09/2002,Wish It would work,2,"When traveling over 60 mph My truck has alot of wind noise.  The biggest problem I have is the ABS, Break light, and Traction Off light will come on while driving about 4 times a week. I keep hearing a rattle from the passenger side of the truck that the dealer cannot find.  When the truck is running right I do enjoy the ride even though I only get between 12 and 15 miles per gallon on the high way."
gmc,envoy,2002,april ravipong, 05/28/2003,excellent,4,"I love my Envoy. It is very spacious, 
and I can manage the vehicle very well. 
The style of the vehicle is good. Not 
to big and not to little."
gmc,envoy,2002,DGF, 06/06/2003,Envoy,3,"Quality of products used for the 
interior are poor. Handeling is poor."
gmc,envoy,2002,Doug Adams, 06/23/2003,Nice Product!,4,"After a year of owning this SUV, we are 
pleased overall. Very comfortable to 
drive, average mileage. I have owned 
Expedition, Explorers, etc. and am 
pleased to move back to GM. I'm having 
a little difficulty adjusting to size 
after Expedition. Only one small 
problem in a year (leaking water). Good 
performance in the 6 cyl engine! Very 
quiet to drive. Would recommend this 
vehicle to anyone."
gmc,envoy,2002,le, 03/31/2002,Great Vehicle So Far,5,"Just took delivery of a new Envoy. Last vehicle was a GMC Denali which traveled 35000 miles in 14 mo. It's a tough act to follow, but I must say in a lot of ways it's a better vehicle. I've put 1000 miles on it so far with no problems. Much better gas milage,almost as much pick-up and very comfortable. Actually the Envoy has more leg room in it than the Denali. I'm very impressed so far!!!"
gmc,envoy,2002,PLW, 09/07/2018,Great 02 SUV So Far,5,"Just bought my used 02 GMC Envoy with 198000 on it have had it for about a month now so far i replaced the shifter cable on it total cost 155.00 it came back loose and was just snapped back in place no charge by my mechanic but since learned to do that myself only takes 5 minutes or less it also  rides smooth  and handles  pretty good the air and heat works great everything inside seems to be good as well the downside gas mileage isn't that great a larger gas tank could have been installed, just have to wait longer after owning it for a review update.

gmc,envoy,2002,sugarmag, 10/04/2002,can you say lemon?????,2,"$32,000 down the drain!!!!

have been working the last few weeks 
trying to get a buyback from GMC.

this suv has been in the shop at least 
once a month since i bought it...all 
for the same problem.

they can not seem to fix the problem
(service engine light is on)

i've drove a loaner for 8 days in 3 
weeks....picked it up again today.

im tired of spending at least one day a 
week at dealer...

i spent over 32,000 on a car i expect 
it to work! i expect that they will 
know how to fix it.

i would NEVER EVER buy another GMC 
again."
gmc,envoy,2002,ron jones, 10/23/2002,final fix,4,"The only thing we did not like about 
the vehicle was that the passenger's 
seat belt would always lock up and not 
release. The dealer fixed this with a 
seat belt extension."
gmc,envoy,2002,hlj, 12/03/2003,Not so good,2,"In to the dealer for sensors in AC, 
Emissions system, and a couple 
other minor problems.  Performance 
reminds me of  driving a Japanese 
SUV instead of American Iron.  
Should have got a 5.3 V8 as is in my 
Sierra or better yet, a Yukon.  I call 
this my ""Graco"" (baby carriage). "
gmc,envoy,2002,harrydownsouth, 03/05/2004,"Good, but could be better.",3,"I am a commuter who drives 35 miles each
way for work. I like the size of the car
and that it has room to carry most items
but is small enough to look sporty
and it gets acceptable gas mileage. The
interior is fine except for one area,
its arm rests are hard plastic and are
very uncomfortable during long drives. 
The model has had several recalls, none
of which were serious for me. I am
able to use regular gas without problem.
I am concerned about the long term
expectency of the aluminum alloy engine.
 GMC did OK but the hard plastic arm
rests and the recalls make me think they
were not as professional as they claimed
and could be better."
gmc,envoy,2002,port1988, 06/19/2003,Good by GM,2,"I have bought 8 new vehicles in the 
last 5 years, 3 of them from GM , all 
of them have been nothing but trips 
back to the Dealer. My new Envoy 
$37,325 peice of junk, wipers stopped 
working twice in the middle of a snow 
storm (replaced censor) the front 
bumper had to be reattached the AC 
stopped working. The rattles 
underneath sound like the truck is 
old. (4800)The front drivers seat 
Squeeks and now a recall that the 
engine block could crack and the 
electrical system (dash board) could 
fail, Two recalls in the same month.  
I have only 4800 miles on this truck 
and I just sold it for a TOYOTA, never 
again GM."
gmc,envoy,2002,newbee envoy owner, 02/04/2002,Envoy Piston problems???,3,"Just a few weeks into buying an envoy, the piston cracked and the whole engine and new style of piston had to be replaced.  2 weeks in the shop already.

Anyone else had this problem?

Like the truck, except the cheap fake wood grain dash."
gmc,envoy,2002,duped, 08/21/2002,Lousy suv,1,"Having driven this car for 20k 
miles,I'm getting rid of it.  It is 
very uncomfortable, has poorly 
designed interior features, handles 
slugglishlyt and is lousy in deep snow 
and offroad.  Many things have broken, 
fallen off, or were installed 
incorrectly.  Quality is poor for the 
hefty price.  Never again!"
gmc,envoy,2002,JPK, 04/04/2002,Past Grand Cherokee and Explorer Owner,4,"We just bought our truck a week or so 
ago and really like it a lot.  After 
having a Jeep for 3 years and an 
Explorer prior to that, this is 
definetly the nicest of the 3...We also 
looked closely at the TrailBlazer but 
this one just seemed a little bit nicer 
and road a little smoother."
gmc,envoy,2002,Georgia Tuchscherer, 04/04/2002,Inside road noise annoying,3,"My only complaint with my Envoy is that 
you can hear the road noise penatrate 
through the vehicle.  It sounds like 
the tires or wind blowing though the 
rear windows.  We also have an air leak 
on the drivers window.  You have to 
crank up the radio to tune out the 
noise."
gmc,envoy,2002,2002slt, 04/11/2002,2002 GMC Envoy SLT,4,"The redesign has been long overdue. I 
think it's 100% better than my old '98 
Bravada. It handles much better in the 
Chicago snow, and has 80 more HP! The 
only gripe I have is with the rear 
plastic frame on the hatch\tailgate. It 
expands when the sun hits it and 
scrapes away some of the paint on the 
metal panel it's connected to. It's 
only noticeable if you're looking for 
it. Also, it leaves the primer, so no 
worries about rust. This SHOULD be 
solved soon. The new models now have a 
gasket installed between the two. It's 
by far the best vehicle I've owned."
gmc,envoy,2002,JMITCH, 04/11/2002,New Envoy,4,"Plenty of fun power. Nearly 20K miles 
and no problems.
A real winner"
gmc,envoy,2002,lubnag, 04/18/2002,Better than Jeep,4,"It's a great truck overall. Fun to 
drive, love the horse power and handle 
of this truck. Specially the look, make 
everyone take a second look when drove 
by them. The 6 disc BOSE system is 
awsome, plennty of power."
gmc,envoy,2002,Direct52, 04/25/2002,Fun Car,4,"Purchased in October 2001.  Have decent 
fuel mileage of 19mpg.  Mirrors never 
return to the preset position and seats 
frequently do not.  Cup holders are 
poorly placed and there is just not 
enough front seat storage.  Compressor 
failed with 10000 miles on car.  Having 
said all this negative stuff, the car 
has outstanding styling and is fun to 
drive.  The extras (Note taking, 
homelink, bose stereo, etc) make it a 
lot of fun.  All in all a good car."
gmc,envoy,2002,Fourroses, 04/28/2002,The BEST SUV,5,"This is the best vehicle I have ever 
owned and have bought many new vehicle 
such as Cadillac, Reatta, etc.  There 
are absolutely none that can compare to 
the ride, comfort, handling, and 
options of 2002 GMC Envoy.  This Envoy 
had every available option and would 
not own any SUV on the market today."
gmc,envoy,2002,envoyenvy1, 05/02/2002,Would I buy another? NOT,3,"Sorry I don't buy the first year vehicle
excuse. This is a bad reason for poor
quality build. While I like the vehicle
overall, there have simply been too many
problems. weather trim falling off,
transmission problems, incredible wind
noise problems, etc...and a geat deal of
excuses from GM. Oh it's suppose to make
that much wind noise...Right I'm sure
the designers set out to accomplish that
very fact!"
gmc,envoy,2002,clancy, 05/13/2002,Great Buggy,4,"Great drive, good looks, plenty of

whistles."
gmc,envoy,2002,Patrick Smith, 05/24/2002,I really thought I'd miss my Saab....,4,"Had 300 miles on it when I bought it 
(claimed a dealer trade, but more 
likely the sales manager using it.  In 
one week I've intentionally put another 
650 miles on it in anticipation of a 
long highway trip (sideline:  I've 
always believed for the first 1K miles 
you shouldn't drive at sustained high 
speeds while the engine wears in - any 
mechs. or engs. out there who can 
verify or debunk?).  Except for crummy 
gas mileage I love everything about 
this truck so far.  I switched from a 
Saab, so I was accustomed to 
performance and have not been 
disappointed."
gmc,envoy,2002,mjlmii, 05/24/2002,GMC Envoy,4,"Very comfortable and easy to drive. 
several comfort items are nice 
surprises. great off road, with plenty

gmc,envoy,2002,eyedoc, 05/24/2002,Enjoying my SUV,4,"Purchased my SLE in Feb 02, May 24 and 
13000 miles later, no problems.  Ride 
quality is really very good, sight 
lines are good also and the overall 
size is just right for my needs.  Gas 
milage could be better 14city,19 hwy. I 
have the air ride and the tow package 
which makes a soft ride and good around 
town response.  Have read many reviews 
from others, they all complain about 
the 4WD models and the SLT with the 
mirrors and the extra stuff you get 
with leather, seems the extras break. 
The SLE is basic and dependable so far, 
so purchase one with running boards, 
chrome wheels, sunroof and enjoy."

gmc,envoy,2002,S.Fla. Envoy SLT, 06/11/2002,THIS ENVOY IS TIGHT.....,5,"I have to admit this is the best, most 
technologically advanced vehicle I have 
ever seen GM produce. Black, Dark 
Pewter leather, 4wd, running boards and 
1SK-Professional Technology Package. 
The factory DVD player is awesome. The 
Bose system really sounds great. The 
vehicle handles great with the load 
leveling system. The quality of this 
vehicle is first class. I've owned it 
since Sept, 2001 with no problems at 
all. I always look forward to driving 
it. I get a lot of compliments where 
ever I go."
gmc,envoy,2002,TLCollins, 06/15/2002,7 months later and still happy,4,"I purchased the SLT with all of the 
bells and whistles.  15,000 miles 
later, and I am still whistling!  I 
have extremely satisfied with my 
Envoy.  The only repairs (other than 
routine) were to replace the pump in 
the load leveling suspension.  The bad 
pump was replaced in a day, and I was 
on my way.  Smooth ride, expected fuel 
mileage, lots of extras....looks great!"
gmc,envoy,2002,Frank J. Schmidt, 06/18/2002,GMC ENVOY Best SUV on Market,4,"Having owned 5 Ford Explorer SUV's, the 
GMC ENVOY was a surprising improvement, 
both in performance and reliablity. My 
last Explorer SOHC, blew the engine 
from the bad timing chain. 
I need an SUV, so I looked at them all. 
The GMC had this new in line six 
@270hp, more powerful than all the V8 
on the market. Hydro formed framing 
makes this a very solid vehicle. 
Pulling power is more, corning is less 
than every other SUV. Trans is smooth, 
rides like a car. Love it."
gmc,envoy,2002,luvmyenvoy, 06/21/2002,ok by me,4,overall i love it.
gmc,envoy,2002,envoyowner, 06/24/2002,Love My Envoy!,4,"This is a true luxury SUV for the same price as the mediocre ones.  You get 
features with this vehicle that I couldn't have even imagined a few years ago. 
 We love the memory seats and mirrors!  We have had no problems like 
those mentioned by others...maybe GM has worked out the bugs on the 
later models.   I also drove the Durango, and this SUV is much more refined 
and a lower price!  I feel like a millionaire driving it...no wonder it beat out 
even the Mercedes SUV in the motortrend competition!"
gmc,envoy,2002,John26830, 07/03/2002,So far so good... Love my Envoy,4,"Only have had it a short time but love 
all aspects of it, Test drove 5 other

and I liked the looks and ride of it 
the best.  It is a real fun car to 
drive and handles well.  Have almost 
7k miles with a few problems and 
holding my breath.  Love the seat 
recall as my husband is taller than

gmc,envoy,2002,GCrim, 07/13/2002,We are testing Envoys for GMC,3,"I was seriously considering buying an 
Envoy XL but the problem I have with 
American manufacturers, GMC included, 
is the fact they offer a new designed 
vehicle to the public for us to test 
it. We are paying to test vehicles for 
them. Has anyone wondered why Honda and 
Toyota have such high quality vehicles? 
Envoy's get bad gas mileage, small fuel 
tank, wind noise, rattles, too much 
body roll in turns, etc.. Even the 
Idler Arm brackets that control the 
steering were breaking causing loss of 
control and possible crashes. Foreign 
mfgr's test their vehicles first before 
selling them, therefore they are 
quality deluxe! I'm reluctant to buy an 
Envoy now."
gmc,envoy,2002,Elphyn, 07/16/2002,Stunning piece of work!,4,"I've been driving only Toyota products since 1980, but I fell in love with this 
vehicle at first sight (at a 7 Eleven gas pump). So, not to be fooled by a 
pretty face, I read everything I could find on it. It seemed my American-built 
vehicle had finally arrivedt. I got the SLT with plenty of options (Bose system, 
sunroof, polished wheels, etc.)  I love the look, the feel, the ride, the leather 
smell and the entire package. It's the best I've ever had. I visited a few 
dealers before I found the exact vehicle I wanted, but none compared to 
Moore. Everyone, was eager to please and got me in and out in a big hurry, 
without trying to push anything on me I didn't want."

miles per hour and got 22 miles per 
gallon."
gmc,envoy,2002,Paul Johnson, 07/24/2002,Overall,3,"I find the MPG very dissapointing.  The 
tank is too small for this MPG.  Light 
trailer pulling (under 2,000 lbs)VERY

gmc,envoy,2002,adadude, 03/01/2002,Envoy Rocks!,4,"This vehicle is wider and taller than the prior model year, and the interior is as comfortable as you could ever expect in an SUV.

The performance is fantastic, given the inline 6's output above even the V8's offered in this class.

Turning radius is astonishingly small.  The inline six allows this as the engine takes less room than a ""V"" configuration.

I recommend the Envoy.  The SLT model has every luxury appointment you could ask for, shy of an LCD screen navigation system."
gmc,envoy,2002,Polu, 03/02/2002,Beats the Explorer by 1.1 mile,4,"The Envoy obviously has the zest when accelerating, but did not feel too responsive in city stop and go.  There is also a noticeable body lean driving around corners.  However, overall performance, handsome looks, and the loaded features out weights all this; especially the Explorer."
gmc,envoy,2002,Never Again GMC, 03/03/2002,Never buy American Again!!!,3,"I looked at every make and model of SUVs, and sadly ended up with the Envoy. We did not even have the vehicle 24 hours and the power seats stopped working.  Then we had to return to the dealership twice because the engine was leaking oil.  Third, the weather stripping in the rear doors fell completely off.  Fourth, the cruise control went out.  This also caused the tail/brake lights to short out.

gmc,envoy,2002,Cordova Dave, 03/06/2002,Looks can be deceiving!,4,"On-Star stopped working, at night lights would dim to less than 30% if AC, radio, windows were used.  Cracked oil pan lost 6 quarts of oil, nice addition to drive way!  Transmission made lots of noise but went nowhere.  The lights are fixed, the transmission works better, and On-Star works.  4 months later, engine seal is badly leaking. I have no faith in my dealership and GMC as a company.  I think they employ the Cro-Magnon man to build their SUVs."

with it ! "
gmc,envoy,2002,kvilleboy, 03/10/2002,After 1 month some observations,4,"Offers comfort, power, utility, & style. Seats are comfortable & it is easy to get into and out of. Bose sound system is great. Air suspension is very smooth & bumps are well damped. Avg 18-19 mpg.

When started cold, there's a slight hesitation /flat spot on acceleration, that goes away quickly. Passenger cabin heats more quickly in morning.

Quality control at GM is better than it used to be, but they still have a lot to learn."
gmc,envoy,2002,Rodney Maerz, 03/16/2002,For fun buy the Envoy!,4,"I think this is a good bang for the buck. The outside appearance is classy. Body and frame are well built for a smoothe quiet ride. The interior is the most comfortable of all we test drove (Lexus RX300, Mercedes ML320, BMW X5). The only thing lacking in this vehicle is front seat cup holders (2) and easy to reach storage. Don't let that keep you from owning this magnificent SUV!"
gmc,envoy,2002,tgold, 03/16/2002,Update,4,"I gave a review earlier loving my GMC Envoy SLE 4WD, I do still love it but after driving it for about 1,200 miles my gas line disconnected while driving on a busy highway.  Luckily I pulled over in the breakdown lane.  The problem was easily fixed but should never have happened.  I consider this pretty serious and hope it is not an indication of other problems.  Will keep you updated.  Also, rear passenger does not shut as easily as others."
gmc,envoy,2002,funits, 03/18/2002,ENVOY WINS OVER HESITANT SUV CONVERT,4,"Being reluctant to buy an SUV (though I needed one -- living on a dirt road hill in NH), I am pleasantly impressed with my 2002 4WD SLT Envoy. It has matched feature for feature my previous Audi/VW cars -- auto climate control, rain sensing wipers, excellent stereo/CD, excellent seats (power/heated in front), excellent motor/power, smooth transmission, good brakes, lots of cargo space. Though a truck, it handles well and I am comfortable driving the Envoy on highways and ""twisty"" back roads (though some reviews said the vehicle is ""tippy"", I find it stable). So far the build and functional quality of the Envoy has been fine. If you need an SUV, check out this one."
gmc,envoy,2002,cstock, 03/18/2002,professional yes,4,"now have 6000 miles, very happy, great interior, lots of power, looks good, no problem with build quality, so far so good."

My daughter just wished it had rear seat center arm rest thar my previous SUV had.  I feel so comfortable on the plush leather seats.  The power 6cylinder is there when I need it.  I get nothing but compliments when people see it.  It looks nothing like a ""boxy"" American cars.  I also purchased the 4/60,000 mile top-of-the-line ext. warranty just in case."
gmc,envoy,2002,TomRector, 03/20/2002,Recommend the new GMC Envoy,4,"I previously had a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer and moving up to the new Envoy was a great choice for me.  I considered the Dodge Durango and Land Rover Discovery.  I also, looked at the TrailBlazer, just to compare before I bought the Envoy and found that the Envoy came with more standard options, for your money.  So far, after having the vehicle for 3 weeks, I've only one problem, the OnStar had to be re-programmed since OnStar could not establish a connection with my vehicle.  The Envoy rides smooth and has great accelleration and power."
gmc,envoy,2002,jackjrp, 03/24/2002,Excellent Balance,4,"Not perfect but it dusts the competition.  Especially quiet at cruise and a ride that equals/exceeds all competition.

you are considering an Envoy..well I snuck in here as I own the Envoy twin, the Olds Bravada..5700 carefree miles and the 60,000 mile warrranty is the Big difference over the Envoy, not to mention the Olds dealers are selling them at invoice since they aren't as popular nameplate as GMC ""suv of the year""..You'll love the ride and quietness over the Explorer!"

gmc,envoy,2002,Scubadog, 03/31/2002,I'll take it,4,"Have had mine for 11 months now, and the only two problems were the suspension recall (in effect before I took delivery, so mine was fixed before I got it), and a recall to reprogram the transfer case that took less than 20 minutes.  Excellent to drive, all features (mine's a loaded SLT) work as designed, plenty of power, and no problem with Chicago winters.  One annoyance, the side-view mirrors reset themselves to a different location each day, despite the fact that I'm Driver #1 in the program / key fob and the only one driving it."

There's aclicking sound under the dashboard (have yet to troubleshoot that as well as a clicking sound on the right aft side of the truck when I turn the defrost on. This is the worst vehicle I have ever own and I swear I will never buy GMC again.  The interior is cheaply put together rattles far too much and the interior lighting is poor lit."
gmc,envoy,2003,gord, 10/10/2006,2003 Envoy review,3,"At the end of the warranty, I had the car checked and all was fine. I was told nothing to worry about. 6,000 miles later and after the warranty expired, that same dealer provided me with an estimate of almost $2,000 to repair an oil seal, the links, brakes, etc. The SUV runs well, is a smooth running vehicle, but does not seem to be that reliable. Most of my mileage is highway between Canada and Florida, so we do not travel on rough roads that could affect this vehicle. Except for some trim problems at the beginning, a seat module control that had to be replaced (Cost of this module was (900$, but covered under warranty, and an oil leak, I have had no other problems with this vehicle."
gmc,envoy,2003,Cynthia Lampkin, 05/17/2010,I love the Envoy so much I bought anothe,4,"I owned a white 2003 GMC Envoy and that vehicle was the best suv around. Not only was my vehicle stylish it was very safe. I totaled my 2003Envoy and even thou I hit a concret wall that ruck was so safe that I walked away with jhust bruises. The a-frame was bent but the glass didn't break and because that Truck was so well made it held me in my seat and I didn't get tossed around nor did my truch flip over. I really loved those contour seats and the size, performance made me go out and buy a 2004 GMC Envoy same color. I shopped around for other SUV's but nothing compared to my Envoy. I really enjoy this truck and will purchase another GMC vehicle. I can not say enough about my Envoy's "

Everything works on the truck as it should. I read this vehicle is known for electrical problems but we have not experienced any. Previous owner took good care of it, as we plan to. Tried out the 4x4 the other night in the snow, and it was sure footed and felt safe on the road. Very pleased so far. Looking forward to towing our little trailer this summer for camping fun!"

gmc,envoy,2003,Armaheadon, 06/21/2004,Love It,4,"I bought a used Envoy. After reading 
reviews, I opted for the 2003 over the 
2002. I really love the truck and 
don't have any complaints. I did get 
the SLT with all of the extra options. 
The difference between the SLE and SLT 
are night and day if you like comfort. 
I wouldn't have bought the SLE 
version. 
It's a truck..not a car-based SUV. 
With that in mind.. there are only 
positive things to say about this 
vehicle. Comfortable, stylish, and 
very roomy for its class. I average 
about 20mpg..which isn't great.. but I 
wouldn't be driving a powerful SUV if 
that concerned me.
Over all I would reccomend the Envoy 
SLT. "

enough to make your head spin. I only 
have 5 knocks on the car so far....

How could GMC forget to put a remote 
gas cap cover release, and a remote 
rear window release in a car that 
otherwise has every gadget ?

How could they settle for sutch an 
oversize and ugly steering wheel ?

Why can't they make ONSTAR an option 
and lower the price ?.  

Why can't they make running boards 
standard instead of ONSTAR ?....

How about replacing that ridiculous 
sounding horn with a better one ?

Other than that I hope this one lasts 
me a long, long time...and from what 
I've seen so far....it should."

I have a 2003 SLE model and it has 235,xxx miles on it and is the best car we have ever owned , its never had any issues and continues to be a great daily driver. The GMC Envoy is a great SUV to buy, you will get more for your money than any other vehicle.

I have little to complain about, except for the past two summers, the AC unit would mot cool, but actually produced heat (Maximim). After shutting down for a period, the control returned to normal; like something had to be reset by 'going back to zero' on restart. Has anyone else beside me experienced this? I have not had the car to the dealer,as the original warranty has run out and it has not proven to be a continuing problem."

gmc,envoy,2003,ldonivan, 04/24/2011,Horrible Electrical Problems,3,"We bought this vehicle less than one year old- within 2 wks the CD player went. Within six months we lost the tach & the speedometer. Next to go were oil pressure and temp gauges. Then gas gauge. Entire instrument cluster replaced- very expensive dealership repair.
Within 18 months the heat & AC only funcntioned on driver's side, and the radio worked only intermittently. Have had to replace fuses and relays repeatedly- relays are @ $40 a piece. Now you can't run the fan at all or it dies & I don't even want to know what that will cost to fix.

Would not recommend anyone to buy this year of Envoy- unless of course someone would take mine off my hands. Please!"

This time the car just refuses to start. He checked the battery, alternator, and starter. Everything was fine. It just doesn't want to start sometimes. How about electrical issues?

such a roomy interior, they cheaped out

to speed (btw, it seemed as if it had 
170hp not 270) make a pseudo evasive

gmc,envoy,2003,snake , 03/17/2008,"Do not keep after 150,000 miles",3,"SUV was purchased in Aug 2003, it presently has 203000 miles 90% percent highway driving; no serious problems in the first 3 1/2 years, in the last year, replaced air conditioning compressor; transfer case; transimission; alternator; front wheel bearings; front differential and more."
gmc,envoy,2003,Colombiano, 08/25/2002,I absolutely Recommend the Envoy,4,"Rides great. Looks great. Fun to drive. 
Had two problems and dealer fixed both 
repairs with no problems to me. Feels 
and looks like it is built tough and 
sturdy. The gas mileage is bad. GMC 
states it gets 15/20, but I get only 12-
13 driving around my town and 15-16 on 
the expressway to work. Insurance is 
cheap. I feel that Onstar is too 
expensive. Would like to use it and the 
telephone , but it is cheaper to just 
have a cedular phone instead. GM should 
lower the prices for everthing related 
with Onstar and I am sure they would 
get more customers. Wind noise not that 
noticable."
gmc,envoy,2003,AZ TR, 08/29/2002,GM Truck Division Winner!,4,"Ride is terrific with more than enough 
power on hand.  The brakes are disc all

quality switch gear and excellent 
displays."
gmc,envoy,2003,myet01, 08/30/2002,Pretty Good!,4,"First SUV, pretty impressed so far!"
gmc,envoy,2003,ultrakim, 02/06/2008,A very well built ride,4,"We have put 40000 miles on our 2003 SLT 4wd since buying it used.The only problems we have had are a tailight bulb and one service engine soon light. the light turned out to be letting us know it was time to do a transfer case lube change. We love this truck and it looks  fly with 20 s on it. Bose system stock is better than most aftermarket systems with subs and amps etc that I have put in. The in town mileage is about 15 but it is a very solid and heavy, safe vehicle. I feel like we have thousands of more miles to put on it yet."
gmc,envoy,2003,Americano, 09/24/2002,Best Buy,4,"Love My Envoy. Glad I purchased it. It 
is roomy enough for me, not too bog not 
too small, just right. Rides great. 
Handels like a car. Forget the Explorer 
this is the SUV to buy. Spend the extra 
money and get the SLT version. Forget 
the 4X4 if you absolutely don't need 
it. I purchased the 4X4 for just in 
case the need arises. Don't pay 
attintion to those writers that are 
complaining, they are working tfor the 
competition. Trust me on what I wrote 
it is the truth."
gmc,envoy,2003,finnj, 09/25/2002,BEWARE,2,"I have a 2002 GMC Envoy.  The vehicle 
has been brought into the shop 4 times 
so far for a loud engine noise issue.  
They can not fix it.  The vehicle is 
terrible on gas as well.  Can not 
recommend this car..it looks nice, but 
does not perform well and GM can not 
seem to fix problems they know exist."
gmc,envoy,2003,envoy lover, 10/07/2002,ENVOY LOVER,4,"I traded in my nissan SUV for a more 
luxurious vehicle which I found in the 
ENVOY. My cousin has the Pathfinder, 
which I was condsidering purchasing and 
my best friend has the Lexus RX 300 
which I also considered purchasing but 
I am extrmely happy with my envoy, 
mileage is not bad could be better, 
looks are great,comfort, I even talked 
a co-worker in purchasing a new envoy"
gmc,envoy,2003,LEFTY55, 10/09/2002,ENVOY SLT REVIEW,5,"THIS VEHICLE IS ONE OF THE TOPS IN IT'S 
CLASS THAT I'VE SEEN SP FAR. THE 
TURNING RADIUS, THE HORSEPOWER, THE 
COMFORT, IT ALL ADDS UP TO ""A+"" IN THIS 
MAN'S EYES."
gmc,envoy,2003,miltonw, 10/17/2002,It's a winner!,4,"I LOVE my new Envoy...  I got a super 
deal on it too! $4,500 off from dealer, 
plus $2,000 rebate, plus $1,750 off 
from my GM Master card rebate (taken 
off sales price right at the dealer)! I 
test drove the Kia, Mazda, Ford(s) and 
Nissan (xterra) before I bought and the 
Envoy won hands down.  Just the right 
size too."
gmc,envoy,2003,JWR1996, 10/30/2002,The Envoy is Awesome!,4,"GM has really done a nice job with the 
Envoy.  It seems as thought they are 
actually taking some of the foreign car 
interior features and combining them 
with the old GM American options.  I 
think it has great styling and some 
really super features."
gmc,envoy,2003,vinthegreat, 11/01/2002,lost some features,4,"over all i'm happy with the truck but 
i owned a 99 jimmy that had more 
features like,power seat,mirrors and 
temp. gauge,pluss very little storage 
room 
you would think the newer car would 
have more not less"
gmc,envoy,2003,jday, 11/03/2002,Great car!,4,"Bought an envoy to replace 2001 
Pathfinder....Great vehicle.  I loved 
my Pathfinder and thought I could not 
get better, but this one has a better 
ride and better features.  I am also 
getting good gas mileage although I had 
read how poor it was.
I got the loaded W/everything...I would 
suggest this as this is one thing that 
makes the automobile GREAT."
gmc,envoy,2003,TrAvIs, 11/03/2002,Wind Noise,4,"The only problem with this SUV is the 
wind noise. It is very very loud. But 
the digital almost everything is good."
gmc,envoy,2003,Evan5555555, 11/03/2002,THE GREATEST IN ITS CLASS,5,"We just picked up the Envoy, and it is 
wonderful.  It handles like a dream, 
and has a preformance some V-8's can 
not match.  Its is a great vehicle, and 
I would recommend it to anyone 
interested in a mid-size sport utility 
vehicle"
gmc,envoy,2003,kfjr1, 10/27/2002,A V-8 WOULD MAKE IT GREAT,3,"This is our first SUV.  I think we are 
now converts.  The Envoy is comfortable 
on long trips thogh you it needs to 
stop to often at the fuel pump.  Just 
took it cross country and back with no 
problems except a V-8 would have helped 
in the mountains."
gmc,envoy,2003,Andreas, 10/11/2002,Love It,4,"Upgraded from a Rodeo to a 2002 SLT and 
I couldn't be happier. Kids (and I) 
love the stereo in the back. Seats are 
comfortable and roomy. So far haven't 
had a single problem.
Would recommend to anyone to at least 
drive it."
gmc,envoy,2003,muycutie, 11/18/2002,I love this car,4,"The ride is incredibly smooth and quiet. 
It's the perfect height, not too high 
but sits up just enough.  It's very 
comfortable as well."
gmc,envoy,2003,sable, 11/26/2002,Whacky mirrors,3,"I really love my car.  There are a few 
things that constantly bug me.  Once 
is the mirrors.  I love the fact that 
they adjust to the ground when you 
backup.  What I don't like is that 
I've been to the dealer 3 times to get 
them fixed.  The setting doesn't 
hold.  The second is it sounds like a 
truck when you first start it up.  
Especially when it's cold.  I think a 
new vehicle should not sound like a 
used vehicle when it's only 1 year 
old.  The third is the gas mileage.  
I'm only getting 15.9 when it's 
advertised 18mpg in the city."
gmc,envoy,2003,en4rcer, 12/09/2002,Awesome!,4,"This was my first SUV purchase and I am 
in love (or lust). I had test driven 
several other SUV's in it's class 
including the Jeep Grand Cherokee. I 
have had no problems with the Envoy and 
it is a fun vehicle to drive. I am 
about 15 years younger than 
the ""average"" Envoy driver - and it 
shows when people considerably older 
than me compliment me on the Envoy. 
Great ride, loaded with features, and 
has what seems to be a reliable and 
powerful engine."
gmc,envoy,2003,gnlhall, 12/19/2002,Very nice SUV,5,"I love my Envoy.  It drives great and 
is very functional.  The styling is 
much improved (inside and out) from the 
old Jimmy.  The ride and handling are 
superb."
gmc,envoy,2003,Bandit5, 12/24/2002,So far so Great!,4,"I bought this truck in July.  2 minor 
problems so small I can't remember 
them.  Great car.    I'd buy it again."
gmc,envoy,2003,Happy Driver 4U2C, 12/31/2002,Great SUV!!,5,"I just bought this 2003 SLT to replace 
my 2000 ""Exploder"" and what a 
difference between SUVs!  The Envoy 
drives so much smoother with none of 
the wind or engine noise like 
the ""Exploder"".  We bought it in 
Atlanta and drove to Michigan and back, 
through the snow, and the Traction 
Control made it handled like a dream, 
even without 4-wheel-drive.  Average 
gas mileage was over 20 mpg!  The 
heated seats also made it more 
comfortable!"
gmc,envoy,2003,USAFmilitary, 12/31/2002,First SUV,4,"My first SUV, took me over 6 months to 
decide. Test drove:Toyota 4-Runner
(2003),Honda Pilot(2003), Infinity
(QX4),Nissan Pathfinder, Jeep and Ford 
Explorer. Envoy.. best buy. Get the SLT 
(leather,woodgrain,major controls on 
sterring wheel,driver/passenger temp 
control etc). Love the way the SUV 
handles. Family more protected..side 
airbags and turn signals on the 
mirrors. DVD entertainment..overpriced. 
ONSTAR system.. overpriced. Free(yeah)
for the first year.  I choose to take 
the phone service in case of 
emergencies and no towers (reception 
for celluar phone was poor).  Don't 
really know if I will use the Onstar 
system after the first free year."
gmc,envoy,2003,jj10, 01/24/2003,Great Ride,4,"The 2003 Envoy SLT rides like a real 
dream.  So far so good.  I look for 
excuses to go on a drive.  I traded in 
a 1999 GMC Jimmy on this vehicle.  What 
a difference, and I liked the Jimmy.  
The Envoy beats it in every category, 
especially that it rides smoother.  Gas 
mileage is pitiful."
gmc,envoy,2003,RICHARD EDWARDS, 01/31/2003,GREAT SUV,5,"THIS IS THE BEST SUV I THINK ON THE 
MARKET .FEELS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE 
BMWS OR OTHER CARS THAT I HAVE EVER

ENVOY WAS THE BEST"
gmc,envoy,2003,neoutdoorsman, 02/03/2003,excellent envoy,4,"So far very fun to drive, wifes daily

gmc,envoy,2003,hooverj, 02/08/2003,Not Tippy or Numb,4,"After having spent months looking at 
and driving all the other major 
players in this class, Envoy was 
overall and in most areas superior.  
Don't know what reviewer decided ""numb 
steering"" and ""tippy in the twisty"", 
the only one close in quality and 
handling but with better gas mileage 
was 4-Runner!"
gmc,envoy,2003,Fi, 07/12/2003,Love it!,4,"I like the big feel I had a Lexus RX300
I had to get use to the truck verses 
car frame but now I like it better than 
the Lexus I still don't know about the 
mileage yet it is still so new I got 
alot of stuff but opted for cloth seats 
I really think they are more comfy than 
leather, leather is so hot in Texas. I 
love the stainless trim on the interior 
it's different.I got a really good deal."
gmc,envoy,2003,Ben Meyer, 07/28/2003,Zero Defects,5,"Traded a Mercedes ML320.  It was an

Dealer treats me better too."
gmc,envoy,2003,Revilo, 07/31/2003,Great SUV,4,"The Envoy has been ALMOST trouble 
free.  The glovecompartment box fell 
out onto my wifes legs.  The real 
pinion gear seal developed a lead at 
4000 miles, but was repaired on the 
second visit. Handles and rides great.  "
gmc,envoy,2003,S Livingston, 08/04/2003,Last Time to Purchase a GMC Envoy XL SLT,4,"luv my Envoy, but w/all the problems, 
I'm ready to disown. Liftgate panel 
broke in wk. Brake knock & let go on 
roads under construction or uneven. SVS 
says OK. Feel uneasy when braking, 
might hit something/someone. Sensor in 
driver panel had buzzing noise. Took 2X 
for repair. Rotten mildew odor in the 
AC. SVS says to turn off recycling; 
however been doing their way & still 
smells. Looking for another dealership. 
Lining around the windows are starting 
to sound like the windows are open, so 
when driving at 65 mph sound like an 
open window and you hear that annoying 
wind sound. I should be picky for the 
kind of money spent on this vehicle.    "

gmc,envoy,2003,Mgadson99, 08/05/2003,I love the Envoy,4,"I am home health professional.  I drive 
more miles than most people.  The Envoy 
is a pleasure to drive.  It is quick, 
quite and has all the toys I love to 
play with.  As I compare it to other 
SUV's it appears to overshadow them. 
The style is ""All That"" and when my 
Black Envoy is clean!  It is a show 
stopper."
gmc,envoy,2003,Norma, 08/13/2003,Love it!,4,"Have had no problems with this SUV. 
Only returned to dealer because of a 
recall notice. Mileage is what I

me stranded twice-I am thrilled. I have 
had this Envoy for 6 months without a 
care."

it is the best constructed USA built
vehicle I have owned, Build quality
rivals Nissan, Infinity and Toyota all
of which we own.(which really surprises
me). Purchased this on over a 4Runner,
because for $3000 less we got the same
features, more horsepower and onlt 7 ft

less than Toyota and does not require
premium fuel."

vehicle.  "
gmc,envoy,2003,redsoxfan2, 09/09/2003,Great SUV,4,"After much research, went with the 
Envoy vs a 4 runner.  Much better 
price, and has all the options.  Love 
the power, and very smooth.  No issues 
so far, Bose stereo is great.  Looking

new 4 wheel drive.  Nice SUV at a good 
price."
gmc,envoy,2003,Michael - Denver, 09/13/2003,GMC Envoy,4,"I love this SUV. THe only probelm that 
I have had, and it does concern me, is 
that the vehicle has already been in 
the shop twice in the short time I have 
owned it to repair a pressure value on 
the air conditioning unit. Outside of 
that, I am very happy with my new Envoy."
gmc,envoy,2003,wontonandrocky, 07/20/2003,Excellent,4,"The perfect SUV for the money.  It's

gmc,envoy,2003,Mr Ed, 09/19/2003,"Good, but not the best",4,"Overall we are happy with purchase. 
However, it has been back to the leaker 
twice for warranty repair. One repair 
was for the high-pressure A/C switch 
inoperative and the other incident was 
for the engine fan clutch stating 
engaged all the time{ sounded like a 
jet engine under the hood}."
gmc,envoy,2003,Carlmast, 09/20/2003,Disappointed Buyer,4,"I purchased the it to replace my Isuzu 
Trooper. I have had 4 Isuzus over the 
last 8 years with 1 warranty service. 
This is the replacement for the 
Trooper. This Envoy has had the A/C 
repaired 4 times, the power mirrors 
actuators replaced and the O2 sensor 
replaced. I have also had problems 
with the automatic wipers and the 
memory for the radio and seats. All 
this with less than 16,000 miles."

received an offer in the mail from GMC 
that we couldn't refuse(Think ""The 
Godfather"" lol). GMC would pay our last 
5  lease payments on my 2000 Jimmy and 
there were like $3,000 in rebates. So, 
we went up to the same 
salesman/dealership where we leased our 
Jimmy before the end of the month and 
took home our new Envoy. It was my 
first buy after years of leasing. I 
loved my Jimmy, but I really love my

great gas mileage - around 22-23 MPG.  
It is perfect for our 3 member family - 
however the backseat has its issues.  
The seats are too straight - can't get 
comfortable.  The front seat is a 
little tight as far as arm space but 
over all the vehicle is a pleasure to

look of the envoy, and like the GMC 
brand. This truck is smooth, has lots 
of pep, and is very comfortable. Also 
built very well. I love how it 
handles. Sure, it's not the handling 
like I'm used to (Dodge Avenger my 
most recent car) but for an SUV it is 
excellent."
gmc,envoy,2003,bceledon, 10/19/2003,new envoy 2004,3,"Good exterior looks, interior space,

I found it! I needed the convienence of 
the third row seat for carpool,etc but 
I also wanted to find something that 
wasn't quite as ""mom-mobile"" as my van. 
Needless to say, the  sleek looking XL 
grabbed my attention and won me over 
when I drove it. There isn't really 
anything I can complain about. I feel 
secure, my kids have ample room and the 
cargo space is generous when all 3 rows 
are in use. I would have liked arm 
rests and a larger storage compartment 
between the seats (which my husband has 
in his Sierra) but as far as all around 
looks and function..I am one happy

My husband works at the facility that 
makes the engine so we knew that it was 
well made. Was disappointed with the 
gas mileage for such an efficient 
engine. But it has a 16-17 gal. tank so 
I guess it performs about average. 
Would recommend it to others. The 04's

When you get in a strong cross wind 
your wind noise can drown out a cell

entire truck has been re-ground 3 times 
and the rear window leak has been fixed

my size (62  220). It made its way 
through our last 8 snow storm with no 
problems and has handled some light off 
road snow covered trails with ease. The 
only improvements would be to have 
Heads Up Display (HID), which should be 
on every GM product with a base price 
over 28,000 and have the CD options on 
the steering wheel instead of the HVAC 
controls. Most drivers change their 
radio stations and flip through the CD 
tracks far more often than changing the

gmc,envoy,2003,Bill C, 11/28/2006,Florida Envoy SLT,3,SLT/2WD has been a great option for 4 years now. Oil and tires changed/rotated every 3000 miles. 48000 now on original tires! Battery went Dixie after 38 months. Trip gas mileage has been respectable with the vehicle loaded at 22-26 MPG.  All in all have been very happy with our Envoy!
gmc,envoy,2003,Andrew_jad, 03/28/2003,Not bad!,4,"It's my first SUV and overall, I like 
it. GM could make few improvements with 
better quality interior components such 
as seats and plastic all over. A better 
and tightly-fit exterior parts (uneven 
edges and wide gaps) would make it 
nicer. Experienced rattling/roving 
noise after using 2/4WD switch. Dealer 
couldn't figure out.. happens on and 
off.."
gmc,envoy,2003,GAD, 04/03/2003,Good SUV,4,"This SUV is Comfortable with the 
leather option. Ride is good and 
interior quiet for an SUV on a truck 
frame. The Handling is good and doesn't 
feel like it will roolover in turns 
like it's sister the Trailerbazer."
gmc,envoy,2003,MIkeOrangeman, 04/03/2003,I love my Envoy,5,"Unquestionably the best new vehicle 
I've owned.  The Envoy has ample power 
and great maneuverability.  I'd put 
this vehicle up against anything a 
competitor has to offer.  Its very 
solidly built and I'm very pleased with 
it.

Bravo GMC!"
gmc,envoy,2003,sweigand, 04/06/2003,GMC Envoy,2,"The 2003 GMC Envoy is an insuperior 
product and value in comparison to the 
competition.  The engine has large 
amounts of vibrations that come through 
the foot pedals and give your feet a 
tingling sensation.  GMC claims this to 
fall within specification on the Envoy 
and cannot eliminate the vibration.  
The fit and finish on the vehicle is 
also poor.  The average MPG I have been 
getting with the truck is 14 to 15 MPG 
which GMC also claims to be within 
specification.  I would highly 
recommend checking out alternatives to 
the GMC Envoy when purchasing this 
class of vehicle."

8 power with V-6 economy'."
gmc,envoy,2003,EDLee, 04/20/2003,NEW SLT,4,"We have owned SUVs for many years. So 
far this is one of the best. Lots of 
power and looks classy. Pewter Metallic 
with pewter leather interior. Plenty of 
goodies to play with and Bose system is 
great.  Just got it so time will tell 
with the reliability issue. Have a 96 
Blazer that has been a great vehicle.  
Traded in a 2000 Tundra, not sorry to 
see it go. Test drove a Volvo XC70, was 
not impressed.  Volvo dealer was the 
worst I have experienced to date.  GMC 
dealer outstanding."
gmc,envoy,2003,BMK, 09/16/2007,"One of the best, the Envoy.",4,"The GMC Envoy is, in my opinion, one of the best SUV's on the market today. It has great interior and exterior styling all around. It has a very powerful, yet fuel efficent, Inline 6cyl. Engine. It has plenty of cargo room for all your needs, and the four wheel drive works excelent for where ever, or whatever the conditions maybe. The Envoy is also an excelent SUV to drive in the city, where you can just buzz right around with-out feeling like your driving a bus! The only downfall of the SUV is where the seat belts are located in the front two seats. They are hard to reach. "

final discission to buy this car. I did 
not care what SUV I got only that it 
was a new one.  After driving this car 
I can only say one thing ""beautiful"". I 
don't only mean how it looks...but how 
it rides.  The ride is so smooth, it's 
like riding on air.  I dont know if 
it's just that I have not been driving 
my Jeep Cherokee for so long I never 
knew that a SUV could be so smooth.  I 
can only say that I feel beautiful when 
I am in it.  What a CAR.  "

awful.  Fun to drive but you can't talk 
to the person next to you because of 
all the wind/road noise.  The stereo is 
pitiful especially if you have a window 
open.  CD was eaten by player, lites 
flashed on/off first week, had to have 
door realigned , seatbelt locks up, 
ticking from tailgate unfound,loose 
weatherstripping and sagging headliner

America, I tried."
gmc,envoy,2003,skydo, 02/26/2003,03 Envoy,4,"I really enjoy driving this Envoy.  It 
looks great and has a Cady ride.  I do 
agree the it is a bit ""tippy"" feeling 
when cornering hard but it is a SUV 
after all.  The I-6 power is great and 
doesn't have a soft spot.  The 4WD 
system is easy to get to when needed.  "
gmc,envoy,2003,jlem, 02/13/2003,Best vehicle I've ever owned,4,"Bought my first SUV six weeks ago and 
opted for the Envoy SLT, fully loaded, 
mostly because I liked its lines, but 
also because of what I'd read about it.  
Test-drove it and found it comparable or 
superior to other SUVs I tested, 
including Land Cruiser.  

It's solid on the road and quiet, even at 
80 mph, a very comfortable. The only 
negative, a small complaint, is the poor 
city gas mileage - about 14 mpg, 
sometimes less.  But on the highway, I 
get better than 20 mpg, even at sustained 
high speed."
gmc,envoy,2003,ranchan80, 04/10/2003,My first SUV!,4,"After looking at other SUVs, including 
the QX4, the highlander, and the RX-

needs the best!  The looks, the 
performance, and the price won me 
over.  I have had it for about 6000 
miles right now, and not a thing wrong 
with it!  Just experienced a horrible 
Nebraska winter, and the Envoy handled 
it with ease!  Glad i bought it!"
gmc,envoy,2003,andreas, 10/11/2002,Love It,4,"Upgraded from a Rodeo to a 2002 SLT and 
I couldn't be happier. Kids (and I)

comfortable and roomy. So far haven't 
had a single problem.
Would recommend to anyone to at least 
drive it."
gmc,envoy,2003,Uncle Chuck, 05/07/2003,"""Tippy"" ??? That is crazy!!!",5,"The Envoy is a very stable and safe 
feeling drive.  At no moment have I 
ever felt it to be ""Tippy"". Perhaps who 
ever described it that way was 
referring to an older model like a 
2000. If you are reading this, call 
Allen GMC in Laguna Niguel, CA for a 
test drive.  I'm sure you will agree 
with me."

long trips.  Very nice interior."
gmc,envoy,2003,Jimmy the Greek, 06/01/2003,Great comfort and towering views,4,"I'm pleased with the ride and control I

issue is base radio is not that good

the radio for better sound on base."

from the rest in every respect.  It has 
been a great vehicle and a eyecatcher.  
Pewter out and in.  Sound system one of 
the best I have ever heard (Bose) and 
it has plenty of power with a luxury 
interior.  Before you buy, check it out 
or you might regret it. "

The engine 6cyl is still not burning oil, have used mobil 1 and fram filters and have always changed oil at about 7,000 mils, , hope to get about 160, miles out of this suv Had two pont that were sold at 15000 mils and 164000 miles still in excellent shape.drivers seat has cracked and the rest have small white cracks, dash held up well, always had covered. .

gmc,envoy,2004,04ennyslt, 12/11/2014,Best Truck on the Road,4,"After reading others' reviews of the Envoy, I have a few comments. For people complaining of ""knocking underneath, rough shifting"" get your front suspension checked (tie rods/hubs...) I'm 20, make $10 an hour, These are NOT EXPENSIVE TO FIX (Cheapo's, come one, seriously, though.) Not only is this truck WAY better looking than any 4Runner, Explorer, Whatever; but it has THE SMOOTHEST ride quality out of any Comparable SUV I have ever Ridden in (I've ridden in a ton of SUVs). My Envoy has 170,000 miles and I have yet to experience a smoother riding vehicle. If you go to a reliable service center, you will realize this is one of the best late model trucks on the road today."
gmc,envoy,2004,ron9311, 08/18/2009,94000 miles of no repairs,4,"Bought it new, 94k+ miles and no repairs 1st set of brakes @ 60K, 1 battery, 2 trans flushes. It's seen the dealer once for a small recall item and headlight bulb replacement.  This vehicle has a dual personality.  The body is a rugged truck-like body on frame design but the in-line 6 is more like a BMW engine. It's smooth and docile until you punch it. Once it downshifts all hell (and the 290 hp)breaks loose. Unlike most SUV engines its torque peaks @ 4700 rpm and it loves to rev.  All and all its been a great vehicle."
gmc,envoy,2004,jbmiller, 07/07/2008,A good SUV,4,"I was leery of the I6 but it performs well at 275 hp. Gas miles are good for a vehicle of this size. If you've never had a information center option-get it, it's great. Controls mirrors, seats, lights, headlights, tilt down rear view mirror, etc. Mine has leather but it's not necessary. All in all the only problem I had was a bad temp sender for the driver/pass ac control. They fixed for no charge. Ive had a good experience with this vehicle."
gmc,envoy,2004,Ray, 07/14/2008,Good and Bad,3,"I have enjoyed a lot about this car. I got it Jan of 2007 and it has been in the shop 2 or 3 times totaling about $2000. It's fun to drive and looks great but has broken down on me enough that I am now shopping for something else. The first repair was $1000 to reprogram the computer something or other. Then the battery died. The rubber around the doors has almost all fallen off, the power seat control panel just fell of the other day, and the cd player does not work. All sorts of check lights go on and off in the dash all the time and I still can't figure out how to work all the lighting! Like I said, pretty car and fun to have! And not all bad but personally not worth the monthly note!"
gmc,envoy,2004,Rod, 08/08/2008,Like My Envoy,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this mid-size SUV, my first such vehicle. I bought it because I needed to tow a fiarly heavy boat and the Envoy with its standard In-Line 6 engine and standard towing package would tow just over 6,000 pounds, and only a few hundred pounds less than choosing the optional V-8. I've taken care of it and have driven only 10,000 miles per year, but it has rewarded me with no problems at all--not the first rattle or squeak.  I beleive the style has ""held up,"" too and even at 4.5 years it still does not look old."
gmc,envoy,2004,Raleigh, 08/29/2005,The Envoy SLT,4,"This is a solid, body-on-frame truck -- no jacked-up-car SUV wannabe.  I also think it is one of the best looking SUVs on the market.  GM went to great lengths to create a soft ride, but with the result that it compromises handling.  I installed aftermarket shocks, springs and sway bar to lower it and give it the handling it should have had from the factory (see what Saab has done with its version).  The engine and transmission are great, but do not work as well together as they ought to.  I'm looking forward to a Hypertech or Superchips programmer.  So far, however, I have had zero problems and this is a very comfortable, entertaining vehicle.  My dogs love it!"
gmc,envoy,2004,Dennis, 04/08/2008,Good old 2004 Envoy,4,"This has been a good experience from the get go. No problems, followed GM maintenance schedule, not dealers. It is high enough that you get good visibility, comfortable ride and interior and exterior paint have held up very good. The gas mileage could be better but it gets 20mpg on a highway trip. Not great but acceptable. Around town, rural area, it gets 17-18 mpg."
gmc,envoy,2004,MARK, 05/02/2008,Unhappy driver,2,"Trasmission lost second gear @ 30,000, on a trip to Louisiana. Dealer repaired. At 33,000 transmission failed again vehicle out of warranty. Cabin very noisy at highway speed."
gmc,envoy,2004,gaines, 05/20/2007,Best kept secret is the GMC Envoy,4,"Great vehicle! Has power, comfort and safety features galore. Fuel injected v-8 can run with anybody, yet if you keep your foot out of it gets relatively good mileage. We have the SLT XL package. It's loaded with leather and all the other bells and whistles. Do yourself a favor, drive one when you get serious about looking for a quality ride."
gmc,envoy,2004,Steve, 06/12/2008,Perplexed,3,"Ran well for 1-1/2 years until the transmission needed a $1000 repair and the catalytic converter needed replaced.  Since September '05 have replaced the catalytic converter 3 times - GM says nothing is wrong - I beg to differ. The car clunks despite changing stabilizer struts. The car rocks forward to back which is a little annoying. The 4WD service light is coming on intermittently. Gas mileage is okay until the catalytic converter goes bad then drops significantly. Enough wind noise that you can't talk to the third row of seats without yelling.  The engine sounds like a diesel when it is first started and the transmission isn't very smooth, especially during acceleration."
gmc,envoy,2004,DLP, 02/05/2008,Get out your checkbook,3,"Bought this vehicle as new because of the spacious interior (had third seat option) and ability to pull a boat. Luckily, I purchased and extended warranty.  However, I still have a $200 deductible to pay for each repair.  Thus far, I have already had to replace the radiator and water pump.  The vehicle is back in the shop today for replacement of the back lift gate window hinges, and for an engine rattle.  I have also had occasional problems with the ""Service 4WD"" coming on at random times.  In addition to mechanical issues, the highway and air noise when driving is fairly annoying."
gmc,envoy,2004,brent, 05/14/2006,Transmission,3,I went thru 2 transmissions in one year and GMC claims there company to be professional grade.  More like Fisher Price grade to me.  Thank God for warranties!  
gmc,envoy,2004,POPO Rivi, 07/31/2006,Second Review,4,"I've had this Envoy with V6 engine SLE for over 2 years.  The ride is still smooth as butter.  This vehicle suprisingly, still handles the bumps very well.  Like if I've just purchased her yesterday.  Haven't had any major problems with her.  Being a home owner, I'm constantly making trips to Home Depot and I'm glad I have the Envoy.  The snow is never a problem for the Envoy.  The running boards are a big plus to have.  Did I mentioned the power...love the power she has.  I've driven other SUV's and so far, none can compare to her power."
gmc,envoy,2004,Happy in Huntsville, 11/30/2007,Outstanding SUV!,4,"I bought this one used a year ago. I have driven it to and from work and on long trips several times and am very pleased with everything about it.  After putting 20K miles on it - I have had zero problems. I average 18 - 19 mpg work and back, 21+ on long trips and 16 pulling a bass boat.  Love the power and ride!"
gmc,envoy,2004,Dustin W., 11/02/2008,Good for the family,3,"Good reliable SUV overall. Works well for hauling the kids and getting groceries. Tows well, very happy with the 4 wheel drive system. Fuel mileage decent for mid sized SUV. Nice leather interior, easy to use instramentation. Only downfall is poorly fitted shell and bumper, lots of air noise at higher speeds, not very exciting to drive. It a great family car to get you from point A to B, but the trip between is predictible and boring."
gmc,envoy,2004,Ivyrose, 09/10/2009,Lovin IT!!,4,"I purchased a used Envoy in 07, no major problems at 96K, keep the oil change and enjoy the ride! "
gmc,envoy,2004,Dee, 05/10/2007,Awsome ride!,4,"I bought my Envoy new and I absolutely love it! I have had minor problems. Driver window sticks 2/3 of the way down and will not roll up or down. It has been in the shop 19 times and everything has been replaced but the wiring and the window.  The 4wd light is starting to flash for no reason so it is going back to the shop. Other then this, I love the Envoy. The Envoy with the 3rd row seat has a much better ride the the ones without! It glides down the road just as well as a Cadillac. My husband refused to drive it because he is afraid he will fall asleep behind the wheel because it is so smooth.  "
gmc,envoy,2004,Angie, 01/15/2010,Good Experiences ?,3,"""service engine, service 4wd, change oil"".......my dash looks like a lighted christmas tree and no one can find anything wrong.  Door moldings falling off.  Rear wiper washer broke. Knocking noise underneath. Shifts hard and clanks often. No recall for hole in gas tank or cracked gas cap compartment.  Fuel mileage stinks.  NEVER AGAIN.  Going back to a Nissan or Toyota!"
gmc,envoy,2004,Lori, 04/09/2008,2004 GMC Envoy SLT,4,"Love this vehicle!  It rides like a car and is big enough to make me feel safe while driving it while not be a huge gas hog.  Granted, it's not great, but not that bad.  Love the leather and the XM radio, and the heated seats rock!  So happy I went with this after looking at TrailBlazers, Equinox, Tahoes, etc.  "
gmc,envoy,2004,Mark, 02/23/2018,One Thing Goes Wrong...Then Another...Then Another,1,"We bought the Envoy used, trading in a Toyota minivan with well over 200,000 miles on it. Boy, that was a mistake. We owned the car for about a year and a half and in that time I had to replace both front tie rods, the steering rack, the power steering pump, the control for the blower fan, the front upper and lower ball joints, and the water pump. When I took the Envoy into the dealership for an oil change I mentioned that the brakes were pulsating, which was interesting since the dealership told me that they had replaced all four discs, all the brake pads, and the front calipers, doing over $2,000 worth of work just before I bought it. The dealership inspected the brakes and told me that all four discs needed replaced as well as the brake pads at the cost of almost $800. On less than 10,000 miles of driving. We're not the slam on the brakes type of people. So that was the last straw. We traded the Envoy in at a loss for a used Hyundai which has only needed a new battery in the six months that we've had it due to a VERY cold winter. In that year and a half that we owned it we spent over $1,800 in repairs to the Envoy. In the ten years and 180,000 miles that we owned our Toyota minivan we didn't spend half that. Do yourself a favor. Don't buy a GMC. Don't fall for the ""American Made!"" patriotic bologna. If GMC made reliable vehicles they wouldn't have to wave the Red, White, and Blue to sell their cars. Besides, Toyotas and Hondas are made here in the USA too.
"
gmc,envoy,2004,twilene, 01/13/2009,Love my Envoy,3,I think Envoys are the best. I will buy another one after I get out of school. The only real problem I have ever had is that if there is a bump or crack in the road and you hit it too fast the car will feel like it is out of control and the gear shifter nut always comes loose causing the car not to move. I know when it acts up just to crawl under and tighten up the screw. The dealer wanted 200 for the part and I made my own.
gmc,envoy,2004,Jim, 10/02/2006,Great ride except for long trips,4,"I special ordered this vehicle with specific intent to travel with it. To avoid extreme temperature changes, we ordered cloth interior with dual power seats. I have this vehicle over 2 years and have not had one thing go wrong with it, even one rattle. I average 19.5-20MPG with even a little more on long trips. The power reponse and ride is excellent for a truck. My biggest complaint is that the seats are just not comfortable at all. We tried both the leather and cloth and thought the cloth was more comfortable."
gmc,envoy,2004,walt7873, 06/10/2008,Great SUV,4,"Purchased my Envoy new late in 04. I haven't had any major problems with my SUV. The engine was running rough at 40,000 and the dealership repaired no charge. (sensor failure) Other than that it has never been in the shop and we now have almost 60,000 miles. It is very versatile and functional vehicle. I am a homeowner and going to Lowes or Home Depot I can buy almost anything and don't have to think about how I can get it home. I love the back glass opening as it makes it easy to hual my surfboard without having to put it up on racks. When I go golfing I can put transport the whole foursome with clubs and everyone is comfortable. I love my Envoy! "
gmc,envoy,2004,Wind Tunnel, 09/15/2004,Wind Tunnel,3,"please NOTE:  I have the GMC Envoy XL 
V8.  Plenty of power, smooth V8.

There is a wind noise problem.  Inside 
the Envoy it sounds like you are riding 
in a Wind Tunnel or a convertible with 
the top down.  It starts to get""windy"" 
at 50 mph and by 65 to 70 the wind 
noise is unbearable.

Only the Bose stereo can drown it out 
and it needs to be ""crankin'"".  You can 
hardly hear yourself talk or think.

GM can't fix it.  The Dealer has tried 
a bug deflector, but that did not work.

Poor design in and around the 
windshield area."
gmc,envoy,2004,hotreese, 10/23/2004,Cool,4,"I love my Envoy. Looks great! I feel 
like the king of the road when I'm 
driving it. However I have heard both 
the regular sound system and the Bose 
and I HIGHLY recomend the Bose! And I 
wish that I would have got the XM 
radio. But the Envoy is awesome, much 
better then the Trailblazer (I've had 
both)."

Also i had to replace all seals in the rear-end,some how water got in it with the other owner and around later November of 08 i started to hear a loud noise,i took it to the garage and they found i nice chunk of ice the belly of the rear-end. It cost me $1200.00 to replace all seals.I had to change both front wheel bearings and a left tie-rod at 89,000KM. I love my Envoy but they are very costly to repair.."
gmc,envoy,2004,Laurie, 01/08/2016,I Hate This Car,2,"At 30,000 miles the movie player died.  At 85,000 miles all gauges, power/heat for seats died.  Gas mileage is horrible.  I get 12 miles city and 16 highway (V6).

I cant understand why their isnt a recall on the dashboard gauges, its infuriating.  Has completely turned me off to all GMC products.
"
gmc,envoy,2004,Brent, 12/13/2006,Now I'm stuck,1,"I would love to trade this thing in but, the dealer just laughs and points at an endless line of used Envoys that they're also stuck with. Now I know why they were giving these away. My motorcycle has less wind noise, and there is always some sort of rattle. There has been a clanking sound, like something's loose under it ever since we got it and even with the numerous trips to the dealer for all the other problems they never found it. And now that it's out of warranty every time you start it the reduced power light comes on and runs rough until you shut it off for a few minutes then start it again. I advise against buying an Envoy, but if you still want one I have one for sale real cheap."
gmc,envoy,2004,SMosley, 02/04/2010,"Problems, Problems 2004 Envoy",3,"I purchased this car new and it has been nothing but problems.  Every month their is some problem.  The sensors are always going out.  The lights has went out.  Right know, another sensor has went out and know there is a crack in the gas tank.  The service engine soon light stays on, for any reason.  If you don't have the gas cap screwed on the right  engine soon light comes on, if you leave the car running and put gas in the check engine soon light will pop on.  Oh and yeah the fuel pump is going out also.  I wish that I had taken out the extended warranty you will really need it. I did not think that you would considering this is suppose to be a top level vehicle. My Kia was better.  "

good gas mileage.  Averaged between 23-
24 mpg highway."
gmc,envoy,2004,happy in Jax, 10/27/2003,Explorer to Envoy,5,"Brand new, but so far we have enjoyed 
the handling and performance. We have 
gone from RAV 4 to Explorer now to 
Envoy and this is the best of the lot. 
We are high mileage users and the gas 
mileage is outstanding"
gmc,envoy,2004,commander, 11/11/2003,Egg shell front,2,"I was very disappointed in the 
survivability of the front bumper and 
grill. If you check the grill is held 
in by two plastic snap-on clips. I 
accidentaly hit a bird at 60 mph and 
the grill came apart. Very poor design. 
No...it was not a frozen chicken! So 
much for GMC Truck like ruggedness."
gmc,envoy,2004,Chris Da Greek, 01/19/2004,Pretty Damn Nice Car,4,"I bought this car recently and I looked 
at the other cars which caught my 
eyes.  Went to Nissan, Ford, Cadillac, 
and many others.  Everything was either 
too pricy for nothing, or nothing in 
it.  Since i had this car everything 
has been better for me.  The ride is 
smoother, it didnt put a major hole in 
my pocket, and it fits me and my 
friends comfortably.  The only downfall 
is, it drinks a good amount of gas.  
Thats the price you have to pay for 
reliability and a great SUV."
gmc,envoy,2004,Jackson, 03/12/2006,2004 Envoy,3,"Like the look and drive of the car.  My main problem has been reliability issues.  I have had the fuel injection system replaced along with issues with the air pump.  Also, service four wheel drive light has come on teice and was unable to put the Envoy into 4wd.  Envoy currently has 35,000 miles and I am questioning whether or not to keep it.  "
gmc,envoy,2004,Nicelilfox, 03/02/2004,I Love My Truck!,4,"I traded in a 2003 Durango less than a 
yr old. A gas hog and rode like a tank. 
I drove and researched SUV's for 3 
months. Hands Down this truck takes'em 
ALL :)It's gas mileage is 16-18 city/20-
24 hwy <if you drive like me ö¿~ > and 
handles like a charm expecially in deep 
snow and mud.  I haven't had any 
problems and I'm looking forward to 
future models. I can only imagine it 
gets better from what I've read so far.
YOU GO ENVOY!!!"
gmc,envoy,2004,rednekdiva, 03/24/2004,Love the Envoy!,4,"This SUV rides better than any other 
I've driven in its price range, even 
better than the Intrigue or Regal! Tons 
of power. Gas milage is more than I 
expected, though...about 16-21/gallon. 
Looks sharp, built tough, and very 
family friendly. "
gmc,envoy,2004,gmeeper, 05/10/2004,Almost perfect!,4,"Beautifully designed SUV with all the 
features anyone could possibly want.  
Only downside is the low fuel economy 
(15 city/20 highway), but than again 
that's true of most SUVs.  I would 
recommend this car to everyone.  
Spacious and well priced!"
gmc,envoy,2004,GMeep, 05/25/2004,Fun & Functional,4,"I traded in a 2000 Eclipse because we 
didn't have enough room ever.  I 
thought it'd be the end of driving for 
fun now that I was getting a 
more ""grown-up"" vehicle.  Was i 
wrong!  The Envoy not only is one of 
the best looking SUVs on the market 
but is one the best I've ever driven.  
The handling is better than most and 
with 275HP it can keep up with just 
about anyone on the road.  The 
interior design is just as nice as 
those luxury models with having to pay 
an additional $20k.  If you've never 
driven one, get to a GMC dealership as 
soon as you can and check one out for 
a 24 hour test drive!"
gmc,envoy,2004,RUEnvoyous?, 06/29/2004,Van to SUV,4,"Yes, we traded in the family van for an 
SUV.......looked at many, decided on 
the Envoy XL because it has so many 
features that are still compatible with 
having children.  Love the styling, the 
ride is great and the storage more than 
most of the mid-size SUV's we looked 
at.  Very happy with our decision!"
gmc,envoy,2004,OGauge, 09/18/2004,Satisfied GMC Owner,4,"My GMC Envoy has been a pleasure to 
drive.I like the way it handles on 
curves,very smooth! Interior design was
well thought out,before manufacturing.
Automatic transmission is one of the 
smoothest shifting, I have ever driven.
Exterior design caught my eye,because
it wasn't overdone, like some SUV's I
test drove."
gmc,envoy,2004,rgdircks, 11/07/2004,Envoy 2004,5,"I use the SUV as a around town car and 
a tow vehicle for an RV.
Ease of towing was pprime reason for 
buying but I was pleasantly surprised 
when I started using it all the time. 
Ride is nice but firm enough for good 
control. Seat back has lumbar support 
for my bad back and is great. An all 
around great car for what I use it for. 
No problems with it at all."
gmc,envoy,2004,kmbsuv, 05/25/2005,Solid SUV,4,"I have owned my 2004 GMC Envoy for a little over a year now and I'm very pleased with it. The ride quality is great for long trips and I love the exterior styling. It's been fantastic for my many trips to Home Depot.  The wide cargo opening is definitely a plus.  The dual climate control is great because my wife is always cold and I'm always warm.   I have brought it back to the dealer a few times for a few problems that were fixed under warranty immediately. The gas mileage could be better, but I knew about that before I bought it. Since I don't drive too much, it hasn't been a problem even with the high gas prices."
gmc,envoy,2004,kws51359, 01/05/2007,Great Vehicle,4,Since I purchased this vehicle it has totally changed my opinion of GM products. This is a very comfortable and smooth riding vehicle
gmc,envoy,2004,dburch, 01/25/2007,Running into electrical problems,3,"We have had our Envoy for about 2.5 years. We started noticing electrical issues last summer. We noticed the lights dimming and blinking and one day completely dead, just a click. They towed it in and replaced the battery. We still had the blinking lights and eventually replaced the alternator after initially telling it was a normal condition?  All OK untill this week when it was dead again. We had noticed blinking lights a couple weeks ago, also. The dealer had it 3 days and couldn't find anything wrong. I picked it up last night and in the dealer lot the lights went dim, also this morning. We love the way it rides but reliability? Dealer admitted they've had lots of problems with these."
gmc,envoy,2004,Safety, 04/15/2010,Been good with some problems,4,"I have had this envoy since April 4, 2004 it has 172,000 miles on it, been across the states east to west and north to South. Had an emission sensor problem when it was new, a computer problem about 3 years cost approx $2400.00, just tried to have it smogged in Calif and it has a bad valve in the 3 hole and a bad left front bearing. All in all it has been a good vehicle and I believe we have gotten our moneys worth would buy another if I ever get rid of this one."
gmc,envoy,2004,V.L., 06/22/2019,GMC Envoy is Comfortable for Everyday or Vacations,5,"The Envoy is extremely comfortable for front seating as well as roomy for rear passengers. It has A/C temperature  individual controls for driver and passenger. Great looking radio with usb charging and bluetooth. The cargo space is roomy with a privacy screen and cargo net, the rear seats fold down to give extra cargo space if needed. The fabric on the seats is visually appealing as well as long-lasting and durable.  It has runners to aid in stepping into and out of the vehicle if needed and a trailer hitch. The engine runs great and has needed only regular maintenence. A very reliable car.

Envoy. It started from the day I drove 
off the lot. The envoy is sitting in my 
back yard and has been for close to a 
year. GMC will not perform ant warrenty 
work on it. They also will not perform 
any recall work on it. The complete 
experiance has been awfull. I have a

on an SUV regardless of brand or 
ultimate price - hey, I like to save 
LOTS of cash on a vehicle I like.
Without influence by sterotype reviews 
that always seem to bash American-
designed products I went SUV shopping.
The ENVOY won my game. I got a great 
price ($25,222 out the door including 
all taxes, etc.) for a vehicle that was 
priced after taxes at around $35,000.
AND IT IS A WONDERFUL VEHICLE TO DRIVE--
AND LOOKS GREAT.
I have had some time to inspect the 
interior and exterior build -

IMPRESSED."

it is an overpriced test car for GMC.
I have had too many problems with this

interior design, appears nice, but is

gmc,envoy,2004,crabman, 02/18/2004,Envoy: Spanish for garbage?,2,"Here's a partial list of problems I've 
had:
Air conditioning went out. Stereo goes 
out intermittantly. The air shocks 
won't level, so the compressor runs 
constantly and when the car sits for 
more than an hour it lists like a 
sinking boat. (it's been in the shop 4 
times for this and still isn't fixed) 
Rear hatch moulding shrank into the 
inside of the door. I currently have a 
water leak in the driver side. (I live 
in Seattle, so it's wet a LOT) The 
engine hood latch squeeks and must be 
lubed every couple of weeks. The car 
lurches occassionally at a stop light. 
The fit and finish of the vehicle is 
lousy. Body trim has had to be re-
glued etc."

in to be fixed every month. So far so 
good with the Envoy. No problems, 
except for the ""service 4WD"" light on

18-19mpg on the highway and only 14 or

several months for an SUV.  We have a 
4 1/2 month old and we were so 
concerned about safety for him and 
comfort for us and the Envoy was the 
right choice for us.  We looked at 
many different SUV's...All american I 
must say..Jeep, TrailBlazer, Grand

pleased with everything but the 
mileage, it was 14 mpg.  I-95 is known 
as a very hard drive from Washington 
south, sometimes with 4 lanes of big 
trucks and everybody is running 70+. 
The Envoy had plenty of road 
acceleration to get up and go when 
needed and the vehicle handled very

had to have it.  So I traded in my 2001 
F150 and have never looked back.  
Neither has my Golden Retreiver Tigg.  
She and I both like the ride and 
roominess of the Envoy.  The 
performance of this thing with the 
straight six kicks butt on the Grand 
Cherokee V8.  The performance and 
styling beats the Explorer hands down.  
I am most happy with this vehicle.  I 
have always been a Ford man, but the

smitten.

Have two minor problems, one is I can't 
get any water to come from the rear 
window washer, and the other one of the 
turn signal illumination lights will 
not light. I'm sure nothing major, just 
waiting for a few more miles to get 
that adjusted. Only other problem is a 
little wind noise around the drivers 
door. "

gmc,envoy,2004,netnut, 12/29/2003,My SUV,4,"I love this SUV. Although it is my 
first I am very happy with this one. I 
have the SLE with the B package and a 
power sunroof. It rides as smoothe as 
my 2002 Camry that I traded for it. I 
tried the Chev Trailblazer that my 
husband wanted and it was the bumpiest 
ride ever and cheapiest looking 
interior. Also it was the second 
Trailblazer that had a puddle of water 
in floorboard of driver side. One was a 
2003 on a lot with only 6000 miles on 
it and on a different lot, different 
city a 2004 (NEW)with same 
problem, ..so beware of Trailblazers!! 
Overall stick with the Envoy for 
comfort and pleasureable driving."

this has on star which i can use if i 
get into an accident i now that on 
star  automaticly  calls for help and

more bump and the body was tinny.It's 
not as solid as the Envoy.Envoy rides

can't diagnose this!).  Check Engine

so far. Purchased 9/28/03. I have taken 
it in because the service 4wd light 
kept coming on & turn signal freezing. 
Outside of those 2 things it's worked 
fine. You'd also expect a car that's 
$33k+ to come with more standard 
features ie lighted vanity mirrors& a
light in the glove box. Also, gas 
mileage wasn't a shock 
to me because my Grand Prix GT cost 
about the same to fill up. All around 
it's a nice truck and I get many 
compliments. I love the 4wd in the 
snow. It's very responsive to hwy 
acceleration. I may try another when my 
lease is up, probably the SLT XL model 
unless Buick offers a bigger Rainier."

but I feel GM still has room to 
improve.
The foreign auto industry is making a 
much better SUV overall.
The defroster system is poorly 
designed, during a recent snow storm 
and cold weather I could not keep my 
windshield clear of icying up. The 
defroster vents are only positioned in 
the center of the windshied, poor 
design.
The cup holders are poor also, this is 
the second GM product I purchased in 
the last 4 years where the cup holders 
were of a poor design and not enough 
of them.
Would I buy another GMC Envoy again, 
probably not.
I will look at other auto makers."
gmc,envoy,2004,DRBLUE, 02/06/2004,Critics Hate this vehicle...,4,"The vehicle could have better mileage,

esp. around the driver. I don't have 
much space to place sunglasses, 
cellphone,etc.
But I like the engine power, optional 
choice of drives, space for a family of 
four, and the handling. The handling is 
surprisingly good, in 2WD or 4WD, esp 
while cornering or parking.
My rear windshield wiper has been 
replaced, as part of a recall. No other

cargo area which doubles the limited

The ride is smooth, the power is there 
when you need it.  The trim level I got 
is the SLE.  There are two cup holders 
in the front and two for the rear.  
Mine came with onstar, which at first I 
really didn't care for it until I first 
heard how clear the onstar rep 
sounded.  My Envoy came with the V6 
Vortec engine.  However, it eats up a 
lot of gas, but I wasn't looking for 
economy on fuel, so I got over that 
real quick.  My Envoy came with running 
boards, a big plus with the height of 
the Envoy.  And a power sunroof."

more classy and stylish too! Another 
thing that I like about the ENVOY is 
the fact that it is the only SUV that

this Envoy because of potential 
economy with 6 cylinders, yet plenty 
of power with a 4.2L. Also when 
younger (now age 68) I drove a lot of

Yukon.
Now, I feel cheated because the Envoy 
burns more gas than the Yukon. Sure, 
the Yukon has a larger tank but the 
Envoy burns more gas!!!! I drive both 
vehicles regularly so I know this is 
true. I paid the same amount for my 
Envoy as my Mother paid for her Yukon

end. I recommend the 3.73 or 4.10 rear 
end because city mileage seams about 
the same and the 3.42 is sluggish 
compared to the 4.10. Get the 
intermittent windshield wipers, do not 
get the RainSense wipers. Get the 6 
disk radio upgrade with Bose Premium 
Speaker System. Get XM satellite radio."

gmc,envoy,2004,jayoh, 05/29/2004,A Superb SUV - Superb,5,"GMC Envoy handles like a large sports 
car.  I have no idea what some 
professional reviewers are complaining 
about.  The car does not lean in 
turns.  The steering is a good blend 
of smoothness and ease.  The seats are 
the best.  The off-road capability of 
this SUV is on par with the very best 
off-road vehicles in the world.  
Highway performance is great, but 
there is a little wind noise.  The six 
cylinder engine is very powrful and 
you dont need the eight unless you tow 
a huge boat.  The conveniece package 
is great and On-Star is the best idea 
in finding your way around the 
country.  Overall, this is ten.  I 
just wish the sun roof was larger and 
less noisy."

this."

all my friends are amazed that it

neither is comfort!"

11 months. High mileage for work and 3 
travel hockey players. After the first 
three trips back to the dealer for 
engine problems the vehicle is running 
great. 4wd with enough room in back 
are a key for me. The cup holders are 
pretty ridiculous though."
gmc,envoy,2004,jcreason, 07/20/2004,I love my Envoy!!,4,"I am so thrilled with my 2004 Envoy 
with V8. It handles great, comfortable 
drive, very roomy in the leg area even 
with the third row of seats. Will never 
live without a navigation system again. 
Only wish I could play CD's while using 
it. The interior suits me fine. Feels 
solid. Love the automatic headlight 
feature since I always forgot to turn 
my lights off. Everything about this 
vehicle is great. And everyone ooh's 
and aaah's when they see it. We have 
made three long distance trips in it so 
far (over 7 hours) and get about 21 mpg 
on the open road, 15 around town. I am 
a ""fearful"" driver and I feel confident 
in this automobile."

No problems.  Ride is excellent and

Explorer or the 4Runner."
gmc,envoy,2004,KBuchanan, 08/08/2004,LOVE IT!,4,"I just love our new Envoy!  This is a 
great SUV for the price.  I compared 
the 4 Runner, which was easily more 
expensive and found this to be much 
more comfortable, especially for longer

and the exterior is gorgeous.  I 
couldn't be happier about my choice. "

gmc,envoy,2004,igoldberg, 08/23/2004,The Envoy is Awesome!!!!,4,"I have dirven my new Envoy for one

Prior to my Envoy I have owned Jeep 
Grand Cherokees. There is simply no 
comparison. The ride is smooth, the 
seats have great support, and the 
features are extremely well thought 
out. In fact, to date I have yet to 
listen to any local radio station 
because I have been enjoying XM that 
much. Oddly enough, I haven't 
experienced the windnoise that other 
reviewers have mentioned. I strongly 
recommend this vehicle to anyone 
shopping for an SUV."

gmc,envoy,2004,mpensing, 08/31/2004,Envoy has no equal,4,"My wife and I love our Envoy! It's the 
sharpest looking SUV on the road and 
the inline 6 cyl. engine has great 
power and excellent performance. We 
tried the Explorer and 4 Runner, and 
there is really no comparison. The fit 
and finish on the Envoy is far superior 
and the interior really sealed the deal 
for us. I'm sure we'll get another one 
when the lease runs out."
gmc,envoy,2004,lorene braun, 09/06/2004,My new fun vehicle,5,"I enjoy driving my envoy very much.  I 
like the feel of being a little higher 
than someof the other vehicles and I 
think it handles very well.I have had 3 
new pontiac Bonneivilles with all the 
bells and gadgets. I enjoyed them very 
much, but there wasn't enough room to 
take what I needed to with me to winter 
in Florida. I really feel my Envoy 
compares with my previous cars very 
well.  I hope I have as good luck with 
this vehicle as I did with my 
Bonnevilles. I like this one very much."
gmc,envoy,2004,Envoyowner, 09/11/2004,Good Car and fun to drive,4,"This is a great car.  There is alot of

Only problem is it uses alot of gas, 
but we expected that."
gmc,envoy,2004,RochesterNY2004, 09/14/2004,I love it,4,"This vehicle is fun to drive and has

programmable settings for two

Cruise unsafe going down hills. Ride 
has went from good to bad. Suspension 
not as firm as in 2002. Bose sound

gmc,envoy,2004,Cory, 12/11/2004,Overall Great Vehicle,4,"I changed from a '95 Blazer to the 
Envoy, it was like going from night to 
day. I was intially dissapointed with 
the fuel economy, but after a 1,000

I went from 14 mpg to 17 mpg of

I buy another, absolutly,"
gmc,envoy,2005,Michael Petti, 02/20/2015,Known Issue / Got rid of it,3,"I had Leased a 2004 Envoy, mostly highway mileage. Towards the end of the lease had engine code for misfire cylinder4. Vehicle was turned in as the lease expired and I thought nothing of it. 
Purchased a Pre Owned Certified 2005 GMC Envoy SLT, in 2008. In 2010 had to replace Cam Shaft sensor, (this was early warning of problem to come). A few months ago had misfire cylinder 2, replaced the coil & plug, code cleared engine light off. Problem resolved or so I thought. Last month misfire cylinder 4, replaced coil & plug, still misfire. Had diagnosis done via computer. Low pressure in the cylinder. From the blogs on all the sites cylinder 4 & 5 seem to be issue. GM knows but dosent care
Soon after the original post above. 
I traded in my Envoy and purchased a Honda Pilot 2012 EX-L 
It was a pre owned certified vehicle. I took the extended warranty with roadside assistance.
All I can say is Honda stands behind thier products. There was a misfire issue Honda - Paul Miller took the vehicle gave me a loaner no questions asked. Two and a half days later I had my truck back. They also found bushings that prematurely wore out, replaced them, did a front wheel alignment, changed my oil rotated my tires and replaced a tail light. 
Great Service Great Product
"
gmc,envoy,2005,Bruce Strickland, 12/05/2015,2005 Envoy is a Keeper,4,"I bought this SUV, certified pre-owned, in 2008, preparing for a move to rural New Mexico.  This Envoy's reliability has been flawless.  It's gotten us through miles of extremely muddy roads with no problem.  Last summer I had an Alpine car stereo installed for the USB and Bluetooth capability.

My criticisms are rattling door panels and a poorly placed cupholder on the console.  

We had a painter do our interior last summer.  He drives an older Envoy.  243,000 miles on the odometer, which tells me I can drive this one for quite a while.

We moved to a more suburban location in Arizona last year.  Much less driving.  Now that the heat is on, the A/C is ice cold.

The trade-in value looks pretty low; there's no need to trade it  for something newer.  It's still handy for carrying the occasional large item.
"
gmc,envoy,2005,Johnthegmclover, 06/30/2016,Great idea but poor execution,3,"I own a 2005 XUV v8 with 121,450 miles on it.  I have had to replace 11 window regulators, drivers side front, mid gate, and tail gate.  Funny thing is GMC says they do not have a problem with these, what with the $450 plus replacement I guess they don't have a problem.  I also had to have the suspension air bags replaced at 80,000 miles.  I will never buy another GMC or recommend one.
 The newest problem with the car (7-16-17) is with the tailgate.  I have had the swing out latch replaced twice and now it is defective again, as well as the let down latch.  The dealer tells me that GM has an updated latch, and I should replace all 3 of them (the price for 1 is  $470.00 dollars) , they got me again.  Right now my tailgate window is down and the tailgate is held closed by a strap.  Seems like the replacement parts don't last to long. Will be looking to trade in on a Dodge pickup.

gmc,envoy,2005,flexiblesink61, 02/10/2012,Fuel+Oil Sending Unit Failures,3,"It is truely amazing why this issue does not cause GM to issue a Full recall on all cars in this line GMC, Buick and Chevy for fuel and oil sending unit replacements.
You are driving blind.
This issue alone has convinced me that I will never buy another GM product.
Service department in dealerships are terrible and their systems don't work most of the time.
They told me to keep driving with the problem and call them back in a few days to see if their systems come back on line.


Toyota did the right thing when confronted with their issues.
I own part of GM and I insist That GM should take responsibility and fix these issues, since both my trucks have the same issues."
gmc,envoy,2005,Lula, 08/21/2004,Great SUV!,4,"This is my second Envoy.  Great 
handling, super comfortable ride, 
plenty of interior room, and decent gas

it right up there with the luxury

gmc,envoy,2005,EnvoyOwner, 02/04/2009,Not too bad,4,"My Envoy has treated me well. I have put it through hell and it has been treating me like it's new. I do have a complaint about the wind noise from the doors and a rattling in the driver door and the back doors creek when you open them. The fuel economy isn't all too impressive either. All in all though, it's been a great vehicle and is very reliable. The 4.2 Vortec is almost bulletproof!"
gmc,envoy,2005,Terence H., 04/03/2010,Envoy is better than benz.,5,"I have owned my Gmc Envoy for about two years now. I bought it used with 33,000 miles on it. This SUV has so much power. I love looking at the cars in my review mirror after I have left them in the dust. My envoy has been very reliable. I hear so much about how mercedes has gone down in quality. Well with the envoy you get the upscale look with great power style and comfort. Buy an envoy you will be happy."
gmc,envoy,2005,doc465, 07/25/2005,Envoy,4,"Great ride and handling. The turn radius is excelent for the size. it has all the bells for fun, but also serious power when needed. There's safety in size. Suprisingly good gas mileage for size and type."
gmc,envoy,2005,gigigran, 08/10/2008,My favorite vehicle,4,"I traded a Caddy Deville for the brand new '05 SUV and still love it after driving for 3 years. It's driven mostly around town with a few out of town trips. I am happy with the comfort, safety and style.  The only disadvantage-the gas mileage of 15mpg. Other than that I can not think of any other drawbacks. It is absolutely a great vehicle to drive. If there are no big mechanical problems I plan to drive this vehicle for many many years to come. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Echo, 11/26/2008,I'm in love!,4,"I've gone from a Ford Probe to a Saturn SC2 Coupe to an Impala. What took me so long to find this one? I love they way I can actually see the road. I'm in the nosebleed section! Love it!If someone had said I'd own an SUV, I'd have laughed. I'm a convert. I love the Envoy and all it has to offer. Comfort and parking lot friendly. The color is beautiful, too. My only complaint? The seat belt hits my neck, but then again, they all do...I'm short. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Jane, 08/01/2009,Love My Envoy,4,"This was my first SUV and after test driving it, I was hooked.  The ride is so smooth and it handles so well.  Parking in tight places was very hard to get used to, and I usually park way out from where I am going to keep other people from banging it with their doors.  I am very protective of it because I love it."
gmc,envoy,2005,Ken, 02/18/2008,Great American Vehicle,5,This is a great American made SUV. V-8 Horsepower is tops. Great MPG around town and on the road. Drives like a dream and turns on a dime         
gmc,envoy,2005,B. Lowery, 12/10/2004,Smooth Quite Ride,4,"After much research I selected the Envoy SLE,enhanced package with almost every feature I could get without leather. Very quiet, smooth ride. My wife was hesitant having never driven an SUV. It was to be her vehicle. She loves it and already feels very comfortable and secure driving it. It has good visibility,a  very short turning radius like a car,and she indicates it feels like it hugs the road well. Great pick up, with the 4.2L very comfortable interior with all the amenities. No squeaks,or rattles, very tight.  Able to hear rear seat passenger's conversation well when traveling. Plenty of leg room for rear seat passengers. Solid sounding doors when closing. Not one problem to date. Would recommend it."
gmc,envoy,2005,jan sankey, 12/16/2004,Envoy SLT Excellent,5,"I have been driving my Envoy since August and even though it was used when I bought it, it performs and looks like a new Envoy.  It is a delight to drive and the ride is fabulous.  I will never buy any other brand of SUV.  It is A+++"
gmc,envoy,2005,James Britland, 02/17/2005,My Envoy,4,"On February 10th, 2005 I forgot to remove a coffee mug from the rear bumper where I left it. Later, I drove 16 miles round trip to visit a relative in the hospital. A short time later my son walked in with the mug asking how long I was going to leave it on the bumper of my Envoy. That is a true test of a smooth ride and handling. I would add that there are a lot of potholes in New England in February."

I owned it for 3 years with 93K miles on the ODO, This truck is a hero, minor problems happened like leaking front diff, AC blower and .. that is ... just pay attention to regular oil changes and maintenance and drive it any where you want ... Best thing, you can fix many things by your self and few simple tools, it is incredibly simple"
gmc,envoy,2005,ed and angie, 05/24/2005,What an SUV,4,"This is unlike any SUV I have ever been in or driven. It's great for the money,and I will never drive anything else. My 3 year old son loves it. Everyday he asks me to go for a ride. Everyone who has been in it has wanted it. The sun roof is great. My sister has a Cadillac SUV and is now trading hers in for this. you don't need to spend an arm and a leg for luxury."
gmc,envoy,2005,tilave, 01/29/2012,"Great car, few major issues",3,"I've had this vehicle for about six years now, I really have grown attached to it and can't seem to get rid of it.
Over the years it has not given me any major issues except for two things.
One being the starter switch which I replaced three times and the other being the air suspension which started leaking at about 80k miles.
Other than those things the car is rock solid.
Great for camping and long trips."
gmc,envoy,2005,Terence H., 03/20/2010,Best Truck EVER.,5,I Love my GMC ENVOY. This is the best SUV ever. I have owned this SUV for almost three years now I bought it used in 2008 and I have not had any problems. It still drives smoothly and it looks great. I love my envoy so much. I love to let the windows down and turn up my Bose sound system. I guarantee you this SUV will last longer than most new Mercedes. If your looking for a great SUV go with the envoy. The v6 engine is very very powerful. This SUV goes so fast when needed. I am very happy with this SUV. I wish they kept the envoy nameplate the Acadia should be the new envoy.
gmc,envoy,2005,cowboy, 07/29/2005,Envoy,1,"Marshmallow springs, licorice whip sway bars...maybe with hot fudge it would be a treat, but for driving down the interstate or up a two-lane mountain road, this thing is scary."
gmc,envoy,2005,RCNG, 04/13/2009,Disappointed,4,"I have always wanted an SUV and when I test drove this one I loved it.  Reviewed everything inside and out and was impressed with the vehicle and the price.  I had minor problems that got replaced in the first year or two - seal around the doors, light switch inside, seal around license place frame all covered under warranty and with purchasing a new vehicle you have to work out the bugs.  Anyways in my 5th year of owning it the idle pulley went out and now the bearings in the water pump which is very disappointing.  After reading other reviews what else is going to go wrong.  My next vehicle will definitely not be a GMC.  "

Since there is no fuel filter, i am wondering if there could have been something restricting the fuel flow!!!.  Year 4, tensioner pulley bearing went out, Year 4.5 traded the Envoy in for a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  Probably never buy this model again, it was transportation and cheap.  Sticker was $29,500, after discounts and rebates i paid $19,500.  it was a good price on a SUV to haul my kids around."
gmc,envoy,2005,jaduca, 12/12/2009,Excellent Vehicle,4,Very smooth ride!  I also test drove the Equinox Trailblazer and XTerra but the envoy had my vote from the first.  Very comfortable very roomy.  My dog likes it and he hates road trips.  Definitely wouldn't trade it for anything else on the market.
gmc,envoy,2005,David, 04/28/2005,This truck is solid as a rock.,4,I purchased my Envoy for its good looks and power. I really enjoy blowing by the import trucks.  The ride is awesome and it's not that bad on gas.
gmc,envoy,2005,Eyedoc164, 10/25/2004,RE: 2005 GMC Envoy SLT,4,"GMC was always under the radar screen 
when I leased SUV's.  Only test drove 
it because of a GM promotion.  Have had 
the car for only 500 miles and am 
incredibly impressed with its size, 
comfort, carlike ride,  and amazing 
luxury features.  As a 15 yr 
lonstanding driver of Grand Cherokee 
and Ford Explorer, can only say that 
this vehicle is in is every way 
comparable and more comfortable and fun 
to drive.  With more bells and whistles 
than my Eddie Bauer: Onstar, XM 
radio/telephone, rainsensing wipers, 
headlight washers, can't think of 
anything they missed.  Can only say 
that this is a ""  must see "" if you

gmc,envoy,2005,CharlieChan, 06/12/2008,Best Ride of My Life,4,"We just bought this used 2005 Envoy-XL, we traded in our mini-van, which I have driven for the past 11 years with four kids and all.  It was like a 360 change, I love the interior room for the kids, it rides smooth and quiet and looks sharp too. We love it!The gas was what we expected, but we had to compromise, either get another van to make all the room or pay for the gas and make use of what we want.  All in all I am very pleased with our purchase and I swore I would never buy from GM again, was even looking at Honda or Nissan.  "
gmc,envoy,2005,taylor, 08/13/2008,Awesome,4,"Got this vehicle in May of '08, can't be happier. Has the power I need, the 4wd option is great, and when I drive it nice I have gotten 23mpg with it. If you complain about the mileage, be easy on it. When I drive hard I still can get over 15mpg with it. Overall, the best decision I have ever made was to purchase this vehicle. Good Bose sound system, perfect amout of room, and overall an awesome vehicle!"
gmc,envoy,2005,Phil, 10/18/2008,"Not bad, not bad at all!",4,"Had been a Grand Cherokee owner for 8 years but needed something with 3 seats (which is outstanding feature) with excellent access. I never was an ""off roader"" so the Envoy, which is truthfully a street SUV was a good replacement.  Terrific smooth, quiet ride on highway. OnStar is a great safety feature, but ditch the XM radio (too expensive). Gas is disappointing, but what do you expect.  Dash features (e.g. wiper, speed controls, climate control) not logical and took long time to understand. Excellent storage, even with all seats up; although front cup holders very disappointing.  Have been thinking about hybrid SUV, but very unimpressive choices in the market today."
gmc,envoy,2005,william mattingly, 07/18/2009,XUV ENVOY-A RARE ONE,4,"I bought my XUV used w/32000 on the clock. So far, it's been a fine one.  I used it for hauling things to Goodwill, etc.  For road trips, I drive my Bimmer so the XUV doesn't see many freeways.  Of course, it's no Porsche so I have to take it easy on crooked, hilly streets here in Sou. Cal.  Overall, I like it!  Also, the used price of $12,000 was fine!"
gmc,envoy,2005,hockeyatd, 10/20/2009,Great Vehicle! Glides on the Freeway,4,"I've been looking for an SLT Envoy for about three months, and let me tell you they are hard to find. Only had it for a week but no problems thus far. Smooth drive, feels like it glides on the freeway. Feul Economy has been less than I had hoped, only getting 14 in town, 19 on freeway thus far. Test drove many 4Runners and Trailblazers and always came back to the Envoy."
gmc,envoy,2005,Reggie, 02/18/2010,Good SUV,3,"This is my first GMC, and it is better than i expected. I owned a Nissan Pathfinder for 18 yrs and I hope this one can last like that. I am very pleased thus far. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Jim, 02/11/2008,Happy Driver,4,"Drive mostly around town and occassional highway trips.  Handles very well for a 4WD SUV and is excellent on the highway.

gmc,envoy,2005,rcelen4hp, 02/16/2005,Bad Choice,2,"I have had nothing but trouble with this SUV. The overall design is great and the features are also attractive. Mechanically the engine & power train are respectable. The electrical is a nightmare. I have had just about everything replaced in this truck. I am on the third ignition, all of the micro switches on the tranmission and theft deterrent system have been replaced! There has been a rattle under the truck that sounds like the entire suspension is about to abandon ship but dealer has not been able to correct. The gas mileage is terrible for a six and the fuel tank way too small. Always stopping for fuel. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Matt, 04/29/2005,This car should be rated higher,4,"Being a former Land Rover owner, this car far outperforms its competition. It has the acceleration of a car with many feartures most other SUVs do not offer, without charging an arm and a leg. Certainly a vehicle that should be considered when shopping for a durable SUV."
gmc,envoy,2005,pbflorida, 05/02/2005,Best In Class,4,"Best size and options for the money  in the Denali XL version. I love it.  It's not too big (i.e. Yukon or Expedition), but is large enough to really seat 6 - 7 comfortably (unlike Pathfinder, etc), or to seat 5 (or 6) by using the 3rd row seat down entirely or split, and still have LOTS of room for luggage and baby stuff (like a stroller). Took it for a 1000-mile trip over the weekend. Great ride, not like a truck, very smooth, comfortable, and steady, with lots of power in the V8. Wood trim and leather add a luxury feel. Power and heated seats (driver AND passenger), voice navigation, sunroof, XM radio, Onstar, all add up to ""what more could you want""? "
gmc,envoy,2005,Monti, 05/15/2005,2005 Envoy,4,"After driving sedans for 30 years, I have found the comfort of the Envoy to be superior.  I needed comfort and enough room to carry my family of 7 in one vehicle.  The kids love the 3rd seat and I like being able to carry items without having to borrow a pickup truck.  The XM radio and OnStar is also a plus. Depends on who's riding with as to what we are listening to.  My mother is 81 and finds it very easy to get in and out of with the running board.  She likes 40's music and sitting up higher than a car. it's a plus for her.  ""I can see things better!""   "
gmc,envoy,2005,Larry Seward, 05/27/2005,My '05 GMC,4,"Great towing vehicle. Not a luxury ride, but better than most SUV's. it has a very comfortable interior. Comes with all the right options to make it ""your car"". This is my 4th GMC... they continue to improve. One drawback, there is very little storage space for personal items near the driver (compartments, shelves or pockets). The engine is strong enough for most of us and trouble-free. Back seats are comfortable and roomy. OnStar and XM radio are great and sound system is excellent."
gmc,envoy,2005,drweby, 06/10/2005,First American Car - Very Impressed,4,"2005 Envoy Denali - I've owned a lot of cars but this is my first American car.  The interior is beautiful, solid, and very comfortable.  There's a button for everything, and I love that!  I love the look of the chrome accents on the outside, and the grille is an awesome design.  The lamenated glass and sound proofing in the Denali edition make the inside very quiet.  The only thing I kind of have a gripe about is the paint isn't as smooth as it could be.  In that department the imports still rule."
gmc,envoy,2005,adidas4089, 06/13/2005,Pros and Cons,4,"This is an excellent SUV, however with all SUV's there is the drawback of horrible gas mileage.  Although the Envoy isn't the worst in its class in terms of gas mileage, it doesn't impress in town.  Highway gas mileage on the other hand, is quite bearable. My tank holds about 20 to 22 gallons, and I usually get about 350 miles to the tank on the highway.  "
gmc,envoy,2005,Thomas Gray, 06/13/2005,Best I have ever purchased,4,This midsize SUV has to be one of the smoothest riding American built SUVs of its class.  It handles extremely well.  Vision of the road is superior as well.  The leg room in the front is the best that I test drove.  Very happy with it so far.
gmc,envoy,2005,Lori, 06/13/2005,I love my Envoy!,4,"I absolutely love the GMC Envoy.  I shopped for 6 months looking at similar vehichles and am very happy with my choice.  The dealer was wonderful and so was GMAC financing.  There was a little ping sound with my interior lights, so I just took it in  and they fixed it right away, while I waited for free.  There are no loopholes in their warranty, unlike my husband's experience with his Ford Explorer a few years ago."
gmc,envoy,2005,Bob Larson, 06/15/2005,Test drive for yourself,4,"Our GMC Envoy is an outstanding vehicle. The ride quality and quiet interior (thanks in part to the power rear glass that separates the cargo area in the XUV) are soothing on the highway. The chassis and steering are more-than-competent in real world driving--this is not a track racer! Amenities are first rate. The new leather seating impresses, the V8 is silky sweet, and the value of OnStar should not be underestimated in comparisons. We like the new touchscreen Nav system and XM radio. It's sad that the XUV roof is being dropped in '06, being a major leap in versatility and beautifully executed. Lovable!"
gmc,envoy,2005,ed nasrey, 06/27/2005,Envoy Envy,4,"This is one of the finest vehicles I've ever driven.  The vehicle looks great and handles perfectly.  I feel proud driving my Envoy, and it seems I have plenty of other Envoy company on the road as well.  The vehicle is sporty, has good design features and is loaded with fine accents."
gmc,envoy,2005,Metallicred Mama, 06/27/2005,"Style, Beauty, Comfort, and Power",4,"The Envoy Denali is an SUV with luxury car performance and style. The car has spacious back rows for taller people, and has well designed folding seats. The rear controls for the air and radio are also a great feature. The Envoy denali is also very powerful. The motor has the power of a sports car for good handling. This is the car for a sports car lover with a family who cares about comfort, safety, and fun."
gmc,envoy,2005,Tonya, 06/27/2005,Envoy,4,I went from a full size Yukon to the Envoy. I love the car and it performs and handles much better than the larger vehicle. If you have more than one child this car may not be for you.
gmc,envoy,2005,Patrick Hernandez, 06/29/2005,Envoy is a good buy,3,"This is my second Envoy that I have purchased, and it stills makes me happy to drive it. It is a comfortable SUV, that has more than enough space for my wife and three smaller children. It is the first vehicle that I have absolutely love."
gmc,envoy,2005,jctomgal, 07/06/2005,Good value for the price,4,"Rides nice, and all the options are integrated into the vehicle very nicely.  The dash features are easy to use.  The vehicle handles well, has a smooth ride, little engine noise, and has great power on highway."
gmc,envoy,2005,yar1260, 07/09/2005,Higly Reccommend,4,"Great overall SUV. Uncompared appearance, a great ride, and a joy to drive. The only thing is the quick response steering is difficult to get used to."
gmc,envoy,2005,Nancy Hill, 07/10/2005,Great vehicle,5,"I really enjoy driving the Envoy. I feel the handling is great, and it is very quite inside when the windows are up. The ride is smooth, and love the v8 for acceleration.  The only faults on the interior are the clock is too small, and it's hard to get to the cup holder above the gear shift on the console. I love the room in the back, but I wish the seats folded down a bit flatter. I love the idea of the built in air compressor."
gmc,envoy,2005,R. Neall, 07/25/2005,Clearly a Winner for GM,4,"Having owned a Ford Explorer, I have that as a comparison for my new Envoy.  To be honest, there is no comparison.  The ride is light years smoother, and despite the professional's viewpoint, it handles corners just fine.  It is not a sports car.  I'm very pleased with the interior room, and it has a great sound system.  The XM radio is great on trips.  My wife is the truck's prime driver, and knowing that she has OnStar puts my mind at ease.  I highly recommend this vehicle. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Rick Cornwall, 07/25/2005,2005 GMC SLT Envoy XL,4,"What a great SUV! Terriffic ride and performance. Gas mileage is about what I would expect (14.4 / 17.2). The interior and exterior are nicely finished. With the 3rd. row of seats down, I can carry all my fishing gear and passengers without a problem. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Michael Milbourne, 08/12/2005,SLT Review,4,"My wife brought this automobile home from the dealership. At first look I wasn't impressed at all. Then I got in and drove. WOW, I was impressed. Satellite radio, leather, sunroof, adjustable pedals, and nice ride. I had rented a Ford Escape for a recent trip to Fla. and was glad to turn it in when the trip was over, but I really liked the Envoy. I find myself finding excuses to drive it. And the GM incentives (employee pricing) made it a no-brainer. I would buy another tomorrow if something happened to this one. "
gmc,envoy,2005,MPG, 10/19/2005,Build Quality,4,"I purchased the Envoy XL (SLT V8) in March 05 and have covered 2800 mi mostly around town. We recently had twins, and now with 4 kids total needed an SUV. I like the quite ride, and have upgraded the rear sway bar for better handling (highly recommended). The V8 has good power and sounds good too, but idles a little rough compared to others. My main concern is with the build quality of the vehicle. The paint job is very poor(Carbon gray) and also I have a warped/distorted windshield. The A/C performance in hot/humid weather is useless below 1500-2000 RPM. MPG is 11-12 around town! These issues will be brought up at the first service. Check out trailvoy.com if you have an Envoy/Trailblazer."
gmc,envoy,2005,Phillip, 12/22/2005,Great Value,4,"I looked at several SUVs including Grand Cherokee,Commander and Explorer, but for the money you can not beat the Envoy XL.The 3rd seat has more leg room than our old '99 Suburban.It drives great and for the money you get a whole lot more options."
gmc,envoy,2005,bmarkdc, 12/31/2005,One Great Truck,4,"I bought my truck in June 2005 and absolutely love it.  The power is great the styling is sharp and the quality is impressive.  A week after I bought it, I  was sideswiped by a semi.  The crash protection is amazing.  The truck stood up very well and had I been in my old Camry not sure what would have happened."
gmc,envoy,2005,rainney22, 03/27/2006,Fun to drive,4,This SUV is fun to drive and comfortable. Very stylish with nice luxury options.  Smooth ride.  I would highly recommend to anyone on the market for an SUV.
gmc,envoy,2005,The Ward's, 04/20/2006,Gas Hog,3,"While the GMC is a sharp looking SUV, the gas consumption is terrible. No where near the quote on the window sticker. And for the amount you pay, you'll have to choose between the payment or the gasoline. Just make sure you check out the service dept. of the dealership. All that is promised in the sales pitch isn't necessarily going to be full filled by the service dept."
gmc,envoy,2005,GM GUY, 04/24/2006,Lost the Suburban,3,"Got really freaked last year when gas started towords $3. We had a '99 4WD GMC Suburban (which I loved), but at $132 a tank twice a month, we figured get rid of it while we could. We wanted a Highlander at first but it was major small on the inside. Then because a GM dealer was nearby we pop'd in to look at the Envoys. After having test drove Highlanders, Hyundai Santa Fe's and Pathfinders we  were pleasantly surprised by the Envoy. The interior and ride were far superior to all the other SUV's we test drove, and quite! That in addition to the  ride and power sold us. Room was an issue after having had a Suburban but we have adapted nicely."
gmc,envoy,2005,Sniles32, 05/08/2006,One of the best mid-sized SUVs out there,4,"Had my Envoy less than one month, but thus far it is performing wonderfully.  Acceleration is much speedier than expected, and the ride is smooth, particularly when compared to the Jeep I traded in for this.  Yes, the gas mileage isn't stellar, but what SUV (excluding hybrids) has great gas mileage? It's right on par with similiar vehicles, so don't let people fool you when they say it gets bad gas mileage.  The handling is a bit mushy -- definitely watch it on corners -- and the backseats don't fold completely flat for loading, and there isn't much center console space, but all in all this is an excellent SUV for the money and I look forward to driving it for many years to come."
gmc,envoy,2005,Nooper pooperson, 06/30/2006,Enjoy the Envoy.,4,"I bought my Envoy because I needed a cheaper car than what I had so I didn't expect much. But this SUV is unbelieveable. The power from this 4.2 I6 is outstanding (290 HP) The ride is the smoothest of any SUV I've ever ridden in. My Envoy Is Superior Blue Metallic with the gray interior and when cleand up this car shines, especially the 17"" polished aluminum wheels. The only drawback is gas mileage. Around 13MPG in town which is not what I expected out of a 6 Cyl. But all of the standard features make up for it."
gmc,envoy,2005,Jackie Woods, 09/11/2004,Fun,4,"I have really enjoyed this SUV. It is a 
smooth riding vehicle and I was able to 
carry 6 people w/ a baby car seat. I 
love this SUV and I plan to keep it for 
a long time."

we have to go anywhere. "

design, great passenger and cargo space.
Great power combined with fuel economy
rarely seen in vehicles of this size. 
I don't think the editors that rated
this at 6.x have even driven one of

cuz this kicks butt on pretty much
everybody else."
gmc,envoy,2005,plbldr1, 10/09/2004,good suv,4,"the vehicle appears to be well built

GMC buyer I am very happy."
gmc,envoy,2005,Lorie Andrews, 10/16/2004,Overall performance,4,"Overall so far this has been a very 
nice SUV, It could get a little better 
mileage, had a couple of little things 
needing attention, seatbelts, leather 
split in back, also where the seats 
fold down on second row, not tightend 
down securely, been fixed, only thing I 
notice differently is the engine not 
being a V-8, had a Town & Country 
Chrysler Van, did get better Gas 
Mileage and seemed to have a little 
more go when going up hills, but with 
my busines I really thing it will do 
fine, love the body construction, only 
thing is, the make the trim out of this 
black hard rubber which kind of fades 
and looks a cheap, especially around 
the windows and the roof rack, love 
the ""Moon Roof, otherwise OK!"
gmc,envoy,2005,ItsMeCyndi, 11/07/2004,Love my Envoy,5,The best vehicle I've ever owned.
gmc,envoy,2005,SMBloom, 11/08/2004,Great Car,4,"I recently got an Envoy - and I love 
it! Its a great vehicle, drive 
fantastic, and drives more like a car, 
rather than a truck.  It has a 
beautiful leather interior.  The only 
negative is that it goes through gas 
quickly."
gmc,envoy,2005,Anincrv, 11/17/2004,WORST SUV EVER OWNED,1,"BEING A LONG TIME OWNER OF SUV'S I find 
my new envoy to be the worst one yet.  
The front bumper cover doesn't sit 
straight,back to dealer 4 times in less 
than a month for that.  It rattles and 
makes all kind of strange noises. It is 
really underpowered with that 4200 6 
cyl. that feels like a 4 cylinder under 
my foot. It is being serviced more than 
it is in my garage ! all this trouble 
and only driven it 275 miles and owned 
it less than a month. I am VERY 
disappointed with it and my selling 
dealer will do nothing about it !!"
gmc,envoy,2005,dougp, 11/30/2004,2005 is a good year for Envoy,4,"I've only had my Envoy SLT vehicle for 
a short time, but, am very pleased.  I 
looked at the Explorer (small inside), 
4-Runner (rough ride at lower speeds), 
MDX (nice but very pricey), & Trail 
Blazer (didn't care for).  Maybe it's 
personal preference, but, these other 
vehicles don't even rate in my eyes.  
Both luxury & performance in the Envoy 
are exceptional.  Beyond the MDX there 
is no comparison between the Envoy & 
the others.  If Edmunds feels the 
interior is cheap or full of plastic 
then they better go look again.  I saw 
exactly the opposite with my 
evaluation.  The ride (on roads) is 
very smooth and the vehicle turns 
quite nicely; I don't off-road."

gmc,envoy,2005,George Mulder, 01/23/2005,"Strength, Power, Luxury, and Style!!",4,"What a great surprise!  After having a Jimmy and being bored to tears by the Ford Explorer, the Envoy is such a refreshing change.  Great luxury car appointments, powerful engine, good handling, and now more stylish than the Jimmy or what is available today in other SUV's.  Feels and handles like a car but gives the 'highup' ride advantages, and though I will probably never use all the capacity can tow 2,500 lbs about 2,000 pounds more than the Explorer.  Fit and finish is great, the interior is very stylish, yet sporty, love the wood trim everywhere!  Thanks GMC, I'll hate letting this one go at lease end!  Truly the 'Cadillac' of Midsized SUV's!!"
gmc,envoy,2005,Dan, 03/05/2005,Envoy- Awesome Vehicle,5,"Envoy is a wonderful vehicle with a luxurious looking interior.  Very quiet ride, and the vehicle is the perfect size for a family of four.  Handling in the winter is excellent in Auto 4WD or in 4WD.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone considering a midsize sport utility.  The inline 6 cylinder engine is a quiet and smooth operating engine."
gmc,envoy,2005,Brian Cable, 03/19/2005,Affordable,4,"  It's been one of the most comfortable vehicles that I've ever owned. I've owned a Suburban, a minivan, and new pickups, and so far it has been one of the most stylish, comfortable and most accomadating vehicles that I've had. "
gmc,envoy,2005,George Mulder, 04/02/2005,It's a fine ride!,4,"Have had my Envoy for about 6 months now, and I really enjoy it!  I love the new Steel Gray color.  The leather seating is very comfortable, and with all the adjustments, I have a world of seating options.  The heated seats are one of my favorite features.  Everything works very well and makes sense.  If I had to complain, it would be that there are too few special storage spots in the vehicle.  But I'm a bit of a carry it with me kinda guy, so I like to be able to have a couple extra small places for things like sunglasses, money, etc.  But, that is not much of a complaint.  So two enthusiastic thumbs up from me.  "
gmc,envoy,2005,Steve, 05/19/2005,Envoy XL,4,The size of the Envoy XL is the main selling point.  Third row is large and confortable with still enough room for storage behind the seat.  Good pick up and performance.
gmc,envoy,2005,Sue, 06/05/2005,Owner,5,Smaller than the Yukon and easy to drive and get into parking spaces. Gas mileage is a lot better than the Yukon too. it has lots of bells and whistles and a wonderful sound system. (Bose)
gmc,envoy,2005,RickG, 06/17/2005,Gas Hog and GM Quality is sub-par,3,"Nice looking with a powerful engine that tows my bass boat with ease. Unfortunately, GM cut corners on the upscale extras in the Denali and it is obvious. The nav system is primitive and 1st generation. It uses a DVD which means you cannot play CD's while navigating. The nav DVD only finds 50% of the destinations so good luck. I reverted to the after-market Garmin nav system I used in my 2003 Envoy. The sound system is poor quality, the rear view mirror does not have the auto dim feature found in earlier Envoys and there isn't even a coat hook in the rear seat. GM saved nickels and dimes and raised the price by thousands. The older Envoys were a better buy, more comfortable and not gas hogs!"
gmc,envoy,2005,Paul, 07/15/2005,Much better,4,"As far as build quality and reliability so far, there is no comparison to my previous 2003 XL, it's much better. Some road bumps can be a bit choppy, but that was to be expected on the standard wheel base versus the XL. Handling is gererally very good. The ride is very smooth and exhibits very little body roll when cornering. Ground clearance is quite low for an SUV, so this vehicle is better suited for roughing it out in horrible weather than going off road. With the 5.3L V8 and the short wheel base, performance is better than most vehicles in it's class. Also, it's just so quiet inside, great sound deadening. Interior and exterior looks are really good. This Envoy is so close to being luxury, nearly!"
gmc,envoy,2005,Paul D, 07/15/2005,Better Than Expected,4,"It was a toss up between the MDX and the Envoy. When GM announced the employee discount, that pushed us over the edge. In the end, we are thrilled with the SUV. We took it on a 2000 mile vacation and loved it. Comfortable, very quiet, powerful, roomy. I truly look forward to driving it. "
gmc,envoy,2005,rob galla, 07/16/2005,Nice car,4,"This SUV has a great ride and handles more like a car. Moments into the test drive, I knew I would purchase this vehicle. I bought a black one with gray interior. The interior is roomy for the front and rear passengers.The A/C is great front and rear, and the stereo is also prime.     "
gmc,envoy,2005,R. A. Pasheilich, 07/18/2005,Nice Vehicle,4,"The Envoy is a very comfortable vehicle. I traded in a Ford Explorer with 58,000 miles on the odometer. The Envoy is a much more comfortable ride. The navigation radio is easy to use and the DVD player is great for the kids. The 275HP six is best in class. I considered a new Explorer, but found the features and ride of the GMC to be superior."
gmc,envoy,2005,Mark, 07/17/2005,Gas Guzzler,3,"Comfortable, quiet ride quality. Strong acceleration. Leans a little too much into turns. Weak brakes, especially when towing a trailer without brakes. Rear seat is a little cramped. Interior materials are cheap, especially the center console. Limited storage within the driver's reach. Rear seat doesn't recline. This should be standand when equipped with a rear DVD entertainment system. 410 gears along with the 4200 engine are a good match. Poor gas mileage. I don't get anywhere near the 15 mpg city to 21 mpg highway as listed on the window sticker. Good stereo system, however, poor sound quality. The BOSE speakers should be standard on all Envoy trim levels. "
gmc,envoy,2005,charle a duke, 09/15/2005,Envoy enjoyment,4,"This is my second GMC Envoy purchased since it was first introduced. The 2005 offers exellent ride qualities and performance. The 4.2l i6 is smooth and quiet with acceptable fuel economy. The Bose sound system eliminates any wind/road noise that may exist. The self leveling rear suspension works great, but the compressor sounds somewhat strange while outside the running vehicle. I have changed the SLE grille to 2006 Denali version for an added styling que. GM has done a great job as far as I'm concerned. Due to a hard to find package I was trying to locate, I compared the Ford Explorer and found that the Envoy is by far the best bargain in its class. "
gmc,envoy,2005,ehackerson, 09/20/2005,2005 Envoy Denali XL,4,"We have had this truck for one month now and love it.  There is plenty of room for the three kids and it drives like a dream.  I was nervous about moving from a wagon to an SUV, but the Envoy XL is so easy for me to handle...it drives more like a car than a truck.  The third row of seats is large enough for adults so plenty of room for the kids as they grow.  There are so many conveniences for the driver: the passenger side mirror automatically adjusts during back-up, can set pedals for comfort, the seats are super comfortable.  The best thing is that it is not guzzling a lot of gas...the Displacement on Demand must be working!"
gmc,envoy,2005,Theroider, 11/30/2005,2005 Envoy Denali,4,"Drives like a dream.  Solid ride.  Extremely quiet at cruising speed.  Very agile to maneuver.  My wife, who never thought she would care for a truck, now only drives the TRUCK!  I cannot get her out of it.  It is extremely stylish and not very common on the road (Denali version).  Interior design is exceptional.  It's not typical GM plastic on top of fake wood.  There is actually real wood on the steering wheel.  Nice touch!"
gmc,envoy,2005,mark, 12/18/2005,Job well done,4,I came out of a 99 Mountaineer AWD 8 cyl which I loved.  I was not thrilled with the changes Ford made.  I find the Envoy more sturdy and has more creature comforts.
gmc,envoy,2005,DMT, 03/03/2006,Female Point of View,4,"As a short female, this vehicle isn't totally adaptable to my size, but it does have great handling abilities. I have owned SUV's for years and this is very comparable to the top of the line Jeep I used to own.  It has tricks and gadgets that even fascinate my husband.  I am glad I own this vehicle."
gmc,envoy,2005,mkquigs, 05/11/2006,GREAT SUV!,4,"I have had my Envoy for about a year and other than one glitch with the fuel gauge, it has been a pleasure to own.  It drives great, looks awesome, has great space and the fuel consumption really isn't that bad.  Note to people who want great fuel efficiency:  Don't buy an SUV!!  Duh!  I love my Envoy and would recommend one to anyone.  This is coming from a guy who swore he would never buy an American car!"
gmc,envoy,2005,nick, 10/30/2006,Good Overall,4,"Since I purchased this SUV in March of '06 I really have enjoyed owning it.  Yeah the gas mileage in city driving is horrendous (12mpg going easy on the gas pedal and the brakes), but you can't really expect much more from a 275 HP 6 cylinder.  Gets about 17 on the highway.  I really like the the comfort of this vehicle.  Lots of room, great ride, and very quiet.  It looks really nice as well.  The power is also more than I expected it was going to be.  Passing isn't a problem.  Overall a really sound SUV."
gmc,envoy,2005,Mike, 11/12/2006,Less for More,2,"Good Looking SUV.  Poor mileage, poor fit and finish. Seat belt not adjustable, high tension. Noisy ride due to air leaks. Transmission shifts from 2WD or AWD into 4WD on its own. Seats are not as comfortable as in my 2003 Envoy. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Steve, 12/29/2006,Very Happy,4,"Bought our Envoy in September and have loved it ever since. It has lots of power and great acceleration, and has no problem towing our boat and snowmobiles. Very comfortable interior with more space than our old Venture in the rear seat. The Envoy seems to be very quiet driving, all though it has a beautifull growl when you really floor it.  Auto 4wd is great in the snow. The only problem is that the Envoy is a pig on gas, were only getting approx 14mpg and that's stretching it. Overall we are very happy with our Envoy. "
gmc,envoy,2005,gm_jeepforlife, 01/03/2015,Awesome,4,Very Comfortable for long distance trips and reliable I have had this vehicle  since 2006 and it only has 95k miles and will never get rid of it
gmc,envoy,2005,Lori, 04/21/2007,2005 GMC Envoy SLE,4,Very bad gas mileage but rides better than a car. Minor mechanical problems that can never be duplicated when taken to the dealership. Great for driving in rain. Handles well.
gmc,envoy,2005,Elijah Marks, 04/26/2007,Great truck,4,This is a solid truck. The power is awesome. It is comfortable on long trips and has a good amount of room. It is fun to drive and handles well and has excellent brakes.
gmc,envoy,2005,Pauld, 08/10/2007,Great Car,4,"Coming from a Honda fan, I couldn't have been more surprised to how much I have grown to love this vehicle. I purchased it when you couldn't pass up the deals and I have been glad ever since. Only back to the dealer once for a very small squeak that was taken care of. Tows our travel trailer as if it wasn't there. Quiet, smooth, powerful, very comfortable, good looking.  I believe GM has won me back for future consideration of cars.  "
gmc,envoy,2005,bellms, 10/14/2007,Could be better,3,"Overall, a pretty good SUV. The cabin is comfortable. Although not super quiet inside. The front seat sits a little high and the back does not tilt.  The pickup on the road is decent but underpowered at times of steep incline. I definitely believe there should be a V8, but there is not. The gas mileage for the daily traffic is horrible in town. Usually 12-14 at best.  Highway, impressively up to 22 at times. The Envoys center of gravity is righ at the armrest, which makes for good turning. Last but not least, not very good use of space for seating."
gmc,envoy,2005,NVmy ENVOY, 08/11/2007,I love my Envoy!,4,"I've owned my Envoy for about 2 years now and I couldn't have picked a better car! I drive from Ohio to Georgia a lot and that long drive is tolerable because I am comfortable! I only fill up once to start, then once on the road and still have some gas left over when I get home. Great purchase!"
gmc,envoy,2005,Achris, 05/25/2008,Better than what I expected,3,"Bought this Envoy used at 48K miles. So 10K miles later no complaints. Easier to drive than most other SUV's. Good acceleration, however don't expect a lot of MPG if you tend to speed. Though looking at these other reviews I get about 19mpg on this with normal driving. "
gmc,envoy,2005,Anita, 02/21/2019,Absolutely love my Envoy,5,"Ive had my Envoy for 4 years now and when I say this baby has never ever broken down on me it hasn't🙌🙌. My 2005 GMC Envoy SLT is bulletproof. At lease that's how I feel. I've totally mistreated this truck and it still rides like a Champ!! I've drive it from Houston Texas to Las Vegas with no problems. All over Texas. It now has 226 plus thousand miles. I have replace control arms, tie rods, brakes, rotors, calipers, tires and spark plugs but that was just because I was towing my Honda from Texas to Vegas and I wanted to do some maintenance. I did have to replace the throttle body because it was stalling and my ac wouldn't work. Everything I turned my ac on my truck would stall. Changed my throttle body after cleaning it a few times and no longer have that issue. Now I'm starting to have some electrical issues with my instrument cluster. When it acts up my radio turns off. My windows won't go up and all my lights on my dashboard turn on. Im going to replace that too. No need to buy a new car when my paid off suv is a champ!!!
"
gmc,envoy,2006,Ian Brown, 04/12/2015,2006 GMC Envoy 4.2 I6,4,"I used to have a Jeep Wrangler with the 2.5 liter engine and the AX5 transmission. Tons of fun to drive, but the transmission is not a drivers transmission, I smoked two of them before trading it for my Envoy.  The 4.2 I6 feels stronger than what GMC gives it credit for, the Envoy has a tighter turning radius than my old Jeep! And it is absolutely wonderful to drive! It has excellent driving manners, and you can feel vehicle response in your feet and hands with nothing left vague. My cockpit space feels luxurious and my daughter cant quit raving about the lavish wood grain interior, ventilation, leather seats and well appointed use of chrome.  I don't miss my jeep in the least.   "
gmc,envoy,2006,envoydenali, 03/01/2011,Great Car for the first 3 years,3,"This was a great car for the first few years. I bought it new a month or two before the 2007's came out and got it for right around invoice price. The interior is nice, performs well, tows well (but I've never towed anything super heavy). However I started having problems shortly after the warranty ran out.

-At 40K the fuel level sensor went out, the dealer wanted $700 to fix. I had it done with a $35 part from ebay and $200 labor.

-At 72K the transmission went out, $2300

-At 92K the engine had to be replaced, $6700

-At 93K the throttle sensor had to be replaced

Even though it was great at first, the last 1-2 years have made me regret buying this car."
gmc,envoy,2006,CJAvon, 05/17/2006,2006 GMC ENVOY SLT,3,"Have been driving my Envoy for three months now, had Jeep Gr.Cherokees for the last three years so that's my basis for comparison (maybe a bit unfair).  The Envoy has a smoother ride but the difference in power vs the V8 Jeep is like night and day, towing my 2500 lb boat was sluggish. Head room is tight with the sun roof, only 1/2"" headroom (i am 6 foot)with the seat down full. Very comfortable to sit in and visability is good.  The floor mats are on the cheap side.  2nd row legroom is better than the Jeep.  I get 18.7 mpg average with 85% highway driving.  Considerably less expensive than the Jeep so if you can do without the towing power I would recommend it."
gmc,envoy,2006,Peter, 10/16/2006,Happy with my Envoy Denali,4,"Tows my boat and my trailer with no problem. I believe the 6000 lbs load capacity.  Originally I wanted a Denali Yukon but the Denali Envoy fits better in my garage - a key purchase decision by the way.   Lots of power and with a family of five with two big dogs, the trips to the cottage are easy.    Fuel consumption is fine.  I get the same mileage as I got on my 2000 Ford Windstar.  The DOD works as advertised.  I would buy this vehicle again.  "
gmc,envoy,2006,3magana, 12/07/2012,In the shop every 2 months! ouch ;(,2,"This car looked so amazing, and being young my husband and I thought we needed a beautiful car like this.
It w
as 6 months old when we bought it.

Fuel card gone out twice. 
The air bags that lift the car got a leak and had to replace with normal shocks. (Expensive!)
Air conditioning went out driver side.
Front suspension needed replaced, would not turn.
Not all our issues list :(
NOW:
All of a sudden when driving home from work, at night, my headlights completely turned off!
I thought it was just a one time thing but happened a week later with my kids in the car on the highway! Oh my goodness...I am so upset, haven't driven it at night or hardly at all. "
gmc,envoy,2006,William Michael Scott, 03/03/2019,2006 Envoy Denali,5,"Bought an Envoy Denali 4x4 Feb of 2018.  Truck had 121k miles - one owner and the car had a solid maintenance record.  I paid $6k for the car and I was worried it wouldn't be worth it as an older car with miles on her.  I am 13 months in and I have not had a single issue.  Heat works great here in Chicago where it's been -40° C/F.  Car is smooth and quiet with minimal road noise and no vibrations or rattles.  Very comfortable towing 4,200lb boat.  I made upgrades to the radio deck and having Bluetooth and Android auto is great, also added a dash cam and back-up cam to keep her current.  Car accelerates well from a stop and moderate speed and does it smoothly. Has very little pick up from 65-80mph, even less from 80-90.  Rear seats need to be adjustable, but folding down seats in the back works great for my three dogs.  I am hoping this truck continues to treat me well.  I would recommend a well maintained used Envoy to anyone.
"
gmc,envoy,2006,Mike, 10/04/2005,One of the best SUV's out there,4,"I love my Envoy Denali.  It not only looks great, it rides extremely smooth.  I recently was involved in a car accident, a car ran a red light and smashed up my front end.  My SUV spun 90 degrees and I felt completely safe. The moment I sat in the drivers seat at the dealership, I fell in love.  The interior, design and looks, sold me not to mentioned the 300hp engine.  I could not have ask for more in my first SUV purchase."
gmc,envoy,2006,Darwin M., 10/23/2017,Lemon Envoy,1,"Don't buy this SUV, Had already bought before finding out that there are many many owners having the same problem with vehicle shutting down, left GMC dealer today after service request for problem with no fix as their mechanic said he can't figure out what electrical parts are bad as code did not tell him, He said he could start replacing electrical parts but no guaranty that the problem would be fixed. Called GMC customer complaint line and told to call National Traffic Saftey to register complaint, Everybody that owns an Envoy with this shutting down problem has to file a complaint with them before a recall can take place. Please call to file. This is year later and still having to dump money into Envoy to keep on road.
"
gmc,envoy,2006,tall one, 01/01/2006,Great Vehicle,4,"This is a well designed SUV. I am 6'5"" and fit in it with no problems - one of the few trucks that I can. There are a few recalls out on it - get those taken care of - and you have great vehicle. More then enough power to get you down the road. Plenty of useful options too."
gmc,envoy,2006,Rich Streeter, 08/23/2016,Great ride best vehical I ever owened,5,"tried bmw  mercedies  the denali was and is smoother quieter and more truck than any I have driven, that is why I still have it.
"
gmc,envoy,2006,Angela, 07/20/2009,Love it!,4,"I picked out this SUV for my husband. He had an old Chevy Blazer in high school that he really loved and missed it. The Envoy was the closest thing I could find that would suit both our needs. We test drove it and immediately fell in love with it. Drives just as smooth as the Chevy Impala we had and the engine was quiet yet powerful. Very comfortable and the interior design was exactly like the Impala as well. So we didn't have to get used to finding everything. I recommend this SUV to anyone who's looking for a powerful engine that gets great gas mileage and is reliable, comfortable, and sporty."
gmc,envoy,2006,Anonymous, 12/24/2005,Greatly Improved,4,"I traded in an 04 Envoy XUV. This Envoy Denali is so much better. With a few improvements this could easily compete with any luxury SUV on the market. Even though this is considered a Mid-Size SUV, it is still quite large. Gas mileage is actually slightly better with the V8 than the 6 cylinder because of the Displacement On Demand (rated at 16 city  22 hwy). I dont understand why people complain about gas mileage. They should buy a small compact SUV. With the air compressor you can put air in your own tires. It's smooth riding with the Luxury Ride Bilstein Shocks and quieter with added sound proofing. Color keyed assist steps are a nice touch. Compaired to an XL, this handles much better."
gmc,envoy,2006,desilynn32, 03/19/2013,Annoyed,2,"I own a 2006 GMC Envoy Denali. I bought it 2 years ago with 65,000 miles on it. I had it less than a year and the oil started disappering. Took it into the shop $600.00 later it was fixed, supposedly. Shop guy told me that if it happened again I would no doubt need a new engine :( Guess what it happened today, oil pressure dropped to zero and the check engine light is on and I was only down 1/2 qrt of oil. This vehicle has nickeled and dimed me to death and isn't worth crap for trade. Very disappointed in the GMC. Also GMC will not stand behind there product."
gmc,envoy,2006,aplymate, 07/06/2011,2006 GMC Envoy,1,"I purchased my 2006 Envoy used from Carmax when it had 32,000 miles on it. At the time we bought it, it was making a whining noise from the motor, which the salesman assured us was normal. It was not normal. Left me broke down on the side of the road when the idler pulley broke and tore up the sepenteine belt. Fuel gauge no longer works and check engine light stays on. More recently my driver's side door squeks badly and one of the shocks on my back hatch blew out. I wanted to get a brand new Acadia but not sure I want to purchase another GMC. They do not even have any recalls for any of the problems. Do not buy.."
gmc,envoy,2006,SouthwesternNative, 05/31/2008,Love my GMC,3,We weren't even considering GMCs when we came across this SUV. We love it. We were actually test driving a Buick Rendezvous at the time. It is a heavy old-school SUV but for the price range it was very nice and solid inside and out. Gas is $4 a gal now and we are rethinking it but still a great car!
gmc,envoy,2006,Reliable and Love it, 08/02/2010,Reliable vehicle,4,"I really love this SUV.  It has been very reliable so far and have not had any problems.  Of course, it is the DENALI, everything is top of the line. The leather seats are comfortable, the vehicle rides smoothly and haven't had any problems these four years.  I would also like to point out that the regular mpg in the city is 16.5 / 17 but on the highway I noticed that on our last trip it did 22 mpg, which I think that for the size and weight of this vehicle was pretty good.  I definitely would recommended.  "
gmc,envoy,2006,Jodee P., 07/10/2006,All American Vehicle!,4,"When I first sat in the Envoy, I loved the way it felt. The ride was so smooth. I drove every other SUV out there, even the non-American owned, and by far this was the best ride out there. The interior is by far the best in the price range. I love the chrome wheels and front grille! I am a faithful GM buyer and I get so annoyed out there that Americans don't buy American cars. Well, maybe I helped save 1 American's job in Illinois with the purchase I made!"
gmc,envoy,2006,Ron, 10/19/2007,2006,4,"Very comfortable on long drives. V8 has lots of power and good gas mileage for the size. Been averaging 22 highway and 18.5 overall. Back seats could be set further back to allow more room for passengers, and would allow seats to fold flat with front seats back."
gmc,envoy,2006,GREGORY WESTER, 06/03/2006,Denali,4,"It is a great SUV. Gas mileage is fair with DOD fuel management but it is an SUV so what do you expect?

gmc,envoy,2006,Denali, 10/22/2008,Not too bad.,4,"I've had my Envoy for a little over a year. Definitely the perfect family car for long trips. Smoothest car I've ever driven. Gas mileage is surprisingly decent for a V8 SUV (highest is 20+ on highway, average is 16) Definitely a smooth smooth ride but a little sluggish accelerating off the line. Stabilitrak is an amazing option in the rain. Downsides: narrow spaces between console and door and the seats. Center console is very sub par and constantly loose or breaking off entirely. Low ground clearance makes it look minivan-esque. Nav system is so so and can't listen to a CD while using it. Slow windows and moonroof when closing. Resale value is awful. Plan to keep this car for a while."
gmc,envoy,2006,volvo2robot, 12/28/2009,Could be better....,3,"i am impressed with the v8 like engine and rain sensing wipers. The stability control proved it self very useful when it saved me from a 60mph accident... it handles superbly on the snow and mountains with minimal engine groans... i happened to lean on the center console and the whole thing came up and dislodged itself i simply clicked it right back. i HATE the rear seats there is very little leg room and are very inconvenient to fold. after a year of owning it, we heard an odd buzz we took it to a dealer and it turned out to be a sensor. Another complaint is that the power adjustable seats broke down on the drivers side and the doors screech and the lift gate window opens when it wants to."
gmc,envoy,2006,Ross, 09/15/2010,Love It,4,"I can't understand all the complaints about the Envoy. Must be other brand dealers trying to kill sales. I have had this one over 2 years and presently have 113,000 miles on it with no issues at all. Bought it used with 46000 on it and will buy another if I can find one. The only mistake GM made was going from this to the Arcadia. Mine has the 4.2 4wd, will go anywhere and pull anything I want to."
gmc,envoy,2006,BJR, 10/05/2006,The Best Mid SUV From GM!,5,"I have owed 4 Chey TrailBlazers and the Envoy beats it hands down.  The ride is beyond smooth and it drives and handles like a car.  Chevy needs to learn from their sister company GMC.  This SUV sticker shows 21 mpg on the highway, but mine averaged 26.5mpg over 20 miles at 55 on cruise control. You can't beat that TrailBlazer.... GMC great job!"
gmc,envoy,2006,love it, 12/07/2006,Happy Driver,4,"I love my Envoy. For a truck the handling is wonderful. Great pick-up in the 6 cyl and a very comfortable drive. I splurged on top of the line interior and it is well worth it. My biggest complaint is the very noisy air conditioning system. Unless you have it on low it is very noticable and annoying. Also the back windows cannot be opened unless the front are also open or you have a very uncomfortable air compression going on. Small problems to put up with compared to the very positive performance, style and comfort. I love the OnStar feature. Well worth the small cost."
gmc,envoy,2006,JJ Bookman, 12/17/2016,Reliable family truckster w lots of nickel & dimes,4,"Engine and tranny are very reliable but the exterior trim and interior bits require a lot of fixing, typical GM.

Lots of DIY fixing if you are a handy man or shade-tree mechanic. Part are abundant and cheap, something else broke? ebay here I come!

gmc,envoy,2006,D P, 01/11/2019,Lots of work but still runs,4,"I have over 170K miles on my GMC Envoy that runs great right now but it’s been a long rough road.  Engine, transmission, body and interior are all still great but there have been plenty of ridiculous problems I’ve had to fix - fuel sending unit (twice), tensioner (twice), water pump, fan clutch (twice), thermostat (which was a PAIN!), oil pressure sensor, crankshaft position sensor (twice), steering position sensor, fan blower motor resistor, wheel bearing (twice), ABS sensor, and the traction control light keeps coming on if the tire pressure isn’t perfect.  The vehicle was a solid try by GMC but it seems like a lot of the stuff that broke on it was designed by amateurs or designed to break on purpose.  I learned a lot about having to fix my own car and it nickeled and dimed me constantly.  I can’t imagine how much I saved by doing the work myself but spent many Saturdays doing so.  "

I didn't bother to get the extended warranty because of my false belief that I was buying a quality product that would last. GM has graciously picked up half the transmission cost ($1600) and all but $1650 of the new motor job. I have put 4000 dollars in repair costs into this car in the last 2 months. Not at all happy about this. Love the vehicle..just bummed out about the problems...will probably go foreign next time..Benz or BMW"

Things went well for a while, but after the first 6 months of driving, been nothing by problem after problem. Engine had high pitched squeal which was bad bearings in idler pulley.  Then the spare tire would not come off the underside.  Had to cut the cable and replace the entire spare tire holder. Fuel gauge quit working.  And most recently, had to replace water pump.

I will NEVER buy another GMC and I hope GM goes under because of their selling of product with such horrible reliability."
gmc,envoy,2006,Never Again, 03/21/2010,Never Again,1,"I purchased this car about two years ago and purchased an extended warranty.  The first year I had this car the interior started falling apart. The panels around the passenger seat broke, the lights on the stereo are out and the carpet has a rusts stains alone the back doors(not sure where this is coming from). I've recently started having mechanical problems.  I had to replace two coils and the electrical line to the front light has burned. The worst part of all of this is nothing is under warranty.  I paid 300 for a 60k maintenance that did not include a tune up.  This is my first American made car in a long time and I must say I will never buy another GMC!"
gmc,envoy,2006,Ginger, 03/18/2019,2006 GMC Envoy,3,"I loved loved loved the Envoy at first. After about 2 years of owning it, the seat adjuster went out ($600 to replace), then the window stopped working on the driver side door, the ac went out. There are 6 shock things in the engine....had to replace 1-2 every 6 months ($300 each). Then 4th year, motor goes out ($6000 brand new or $4000 used). Would not recommend to anyone. Also, as your driving, the headlights go out.....for no apparent reason. I was going down the road at night....NO STREET LIGHTS.....I could have been killed!"
gmc,envoy,2006,Tom, 08/04/2009,Poor GM Customer Support,3,The Envoy looks nice. Looks can be deceiving. Fuel gauge quit working. Expensive to repair. Water pump gone out.  Expensive to repair.  GM is aware of the problem history with these vehicles but puts the burden on the owner.  GM knew these parts were not performing up to par and chose to still use them.  Defective parts equals lots of repair bills at the dealerships!  No reliability + no responsibility = No General Motors!  
gmc,envoy,2006,Turan Kul, 04/11/2006,A Horrible Experience!,2,"This V6 Envoy turns out to be a lemon! From the beginning it had that terrible engine smell. My  3 year old goes promplty to sleep within minutes during the ride.  However, we were alarmed about the noisy brakes, oil leaks & being a gas guzzler! (The old rental uses much less gas and has smooth brakes!) We took it to a shop and found out about the AC leakage. Probably that's why my son always ends up sleeping! The mechanic had to order a big part from GMC - I think it's the transmission. He'll fix the gas guzzling problem too! However, I'm afraid to be in this vehicle. I wanted a refund or a new vehicle.

gmc,envoy,2006,LArnold, 07/03/2008,2006 Envoy Problems,3,"I purchased my 2006 Envoy in April, 2006. Unfortunately, I have had numerous problems to have only had this vehicle right at two years. In fact, it is at the dealership today because all the controls on the driver's side door do not work.  They have to replace some switch that is costing me another $350. The gas gauge sensor messed up, and I could never tell how much gas was in my car.  After much controversy, they replaced the sensor without charge.  It was going to cost me $2000. Then a belt was replaced, that led to the water pump having to be replaced. It has been a lot to replace, only having my new car for 2 years, and a lot of money. I will never buy a GMC again."
gmc,envoy,2006,gtp, 05/03/2009,Disatisfied buyer,1,"I have had nothing but problems with this vehicle. From simple door locks to noisy windows to steering columns, transition 5 times, hatch shocks, ignitions, electrical, engine (multiple times)....It has left me stranded many times. On windy days it will switch lanes with out you even realizing it. I was disappointed in the power of the 4.2L V6. It works way to hard. Get the V8 (Gas mileage will even out). It does however handle well in the snow. I couldn't even sell this to sum one I would feel guilty knowing it's a piece."
gmc,envoy,2006,Lola R, 02/22/2010,I know why they are going under,2,"We bought this as a second vehicle last year.  We only use it 3 to 4 months in a year.  So when I got it out for the winter season, this year we had to start fixing it.  1st, the weather stripping is falling off the back door, 2nd the steering rack must be replaced.  The suv only has 39000 miles on it.  I should have know better than to buy a GMC.  I also had to have the fuel gauge replaced second day we had it.  Thank God it was under warrenty.  Stereo speaker blew out also."

I had to replace an idle pulley, fan belt, fuel pump, and just recently I had to rebuild the transmission. Way too many problems for a 2 year old car with only 75000 miles on it. Other than that, the ride is very quiet, step on the gas and it seems to glide on the highway."

Believe me, I looked at EVERYTHING! I eagerly decided on this '06 Envoy Denali. The looks had me from across the lot. I test drove it, and then my husband. We were immediately impressed. Interior to die for, comfort plus.Every option I could hope for. Rides smooth as can be. So we really, really test cars. Straight aways, up and down hills, in and out of town, highway. I was so impressed by the power. It's a pavement eater!  300 HP, and switches to 4 cyl. for HWY cruising(gas saver) and can tow up to 6500 lbs. Looking for a mid-size SUV?  This one's for you!!!!!"

gmc,envoy,2006,Eric, 05/20/2006,Marine Can Do Attitude,4,"With full size SUV's costing an arm and a leg and gas prices just as bad. Our family looked to the GMC Envoy XL with 3rd row seating and was sold on it the moment we sat in it. Great interior quality with the leather package. Performance, it is not a race car but can handle any of the riggors found within the city limits with ease. I found no problems with the steering, its just very easy to manuever. This quality has sold me on the Envoy and GMC as a whole and will be looking at them for my next vehicle purchase."
gmc,envoy,2006,Bunnie, 08/03/2006,I Love it!,4,"I am so thankful that I purchased my Denali! I went from a convertible which was fun to drive to an SUV overnight! I compared so many and found it to be priced very well, appointed luxuriously, & easy to drive. I have to admit, I was nervous about the fuel economy, but with the V8 and fuel displacement, it is not bad at all! I drive a lot of miles and this car makes my commute so much nicer."

gmc,envoy,2006,Jerry G, 11/22/2005,Great car -- just got my second one,4,"My new 2006 Envoy replaces my 2003 Envoy which just come off lease. I never took the 2003 back to the dealership for ANY type of repair. The styling is great and the ride is very comfortable. I drive 99% on open roads and want a vehicle that rides smoothly, which the Envoy does. I also own a 2005 Corvette (I know - a bragger) but I just want to say I often use the Envoy because it's just easier and more relaxing to drive. GM might go Chapter 11, but they are making very good cars! "

I was sold on the red tag promotion from GM. This SUV is powerful, comfortable, user friendly and has plently of features for the price. The satellite radio is great and the OnStar for a year was also a great selling point. I would definitely recommend this SUV. "
gmc,envoy,2006,Carol Drago, 01/16/2006,Denali,4,"Fun to drive, solid, and overall pickup great. A firm ride with all the comforts of the higher end vehicles. This vehicle feels solid to drive and great handling."
gmc,envoy,2006,dbgindy, 03/17/2006,Really enjoy the Denali,4,"This is the third SUV I've had in a row and for performance, ride & features this is by far the best. Sure the gas mileage could be a little better but that's the case with almost all mid size SUVs. I've had mine now for about 6 months and put almost 9500 miles on it with zero problems. I've not regretted my purchase at all!"
gmc,envoy,2006,Tim, 04/03/2006,What a great MidSize,4,"The Envoy rides incredibly smooth and handles quite well. I read the reviews prior to buying and wasn't expecting much in the way of handling so maybe my expectations were low; However,I think the Envoy handles quite well for a vehicle of it's size. I am equally impressed with the power.  It accelerates very smoothly both from a stop and highway driving.  The tranny shifts smoothly and it's tough to even feel when it ""kicks down"" to pass. The interior is roomy, quiet, and comfortable.  Controls are easily accesible and the Bose stereo system is flawless. The interior looks very nice, but I can see quality becoming and issue if it is abused, but normal use shouldn't be an issue."
gmc,envoy,2006,Joe M., 05/01/2006,Envoy,4,"My Envoy rides and drives great. I owned a Trailblazer before the Envoy. The In-Line 6 cylinder is peppy, not a gas hog and great on the highway."
gmc,envoy,2006,Jen, 06/24/2006,Denali...great buy,4,"I researched many SUV's when I was going to buy my vehicle. I test drove many SUV's including the luxury ones. This was one of my smoother test drives and I just fell in love with it. Great new design on the outside and the ammenities inside are outstanding. i have had my Denali for about a month and I have gotten so many complements on it. Smooth, reliable,safe, stylish and its just an all around smart vehicle. I love it!"

gmc,envoy,2006,DEHayes, 07/20/2006,Great SUV,4,"We researched this vehicle for about a year and were drawn by the amount of luxury for the price. We purchased (with the rebate and GM Employee discount) for around $31,000! We have been hauling Little League All-Stars around all of June/July and they argue about who gets to go with us. Best SUV I have ever owned. Love the Navigation system, the DVD, the sunroof and the ride!"
gmc,envoy,2006,Cindy Barranco, 11/25/2006,Affordable comfort and luxury,4,"It took me 3 years to find an SUV with the right price, comfort level, features, interior and exterior appearance and driving experience, but when I did, I knew that this was the car for me.  Not once have I ever had buyer's remorse. I hope this GM vehicle continues to make me proud.     "

I have returned it to the dealership 3 times with complaints of excessive wind noise on the driver side. No matter what is done to it, it seems the noise level increases. I have been told that this is an inherent quality of large mirrors. I traded my Yukon Denali with large mirrors. I did not have this problem with the Yukon. I would like to know if other owners of this vehicle are having the same issue. I am at wits end! PS- What happened to a courtesy light under the hood and in the glove compartment?  "

The Highlander and Pilot are so ugly, and the quality was questionable.. I thought Toyota and Honda were supposed to have good quality? The Envoy Denali has superior performance.  The wood trim looks far more premium and the chrome looks fantastic!  I will never go back to a Japanese vehicle again."
gmc,envoy,2007,curtis love, 07/13/2006,Good value for your money.,4,"I think this SUV for the money is very well built. If you look at other American SUV's costing way more, I think the SLT 4x4 Envoys are about the best out."
gmc,envoy,2007,Patrick's Denali, 12/28/2006,Loving it!,4,"I absolutely love driving this vehicle. That V8 w/302 horses under the hood ensures your entry onto the highway is a seamless transition. The ride is extremely comfortable and quiet. It rides just as smooth as my 2006 Lexus GS300 AWD!  This is a well built vehicle with nice amenities. The Nav system does eliminate the 6 disc CD, however, I never listen to CDs in the car. I listen to my XM satellite radio. My wife and I test drove all the competitor's product and decided to purchase the Denali. What a great decision!    "
gmc,envoy,2007,El Paso, 01/15/2007,Love it,4,"Test drove Ford Expedition, Explorer, Edge along with testing Nissan, Toyota among others. GMC Envoy Denali had the best comfort, get up and go, and look of all the rest. I chose the CD changer and kids love the entertainment system. XM satellite also complements vehicle.  Drives nice and quiet."
gmc,envoy,2007,bittymist, 07/30/2014,"LOVE IT, but the wheel bearings",5,"After testing the cars I wanted first,(a Nissan Maxima and a Buick Enclave, plus a few others) I decided to give this a try. The sales lady had me take it for a whole weekend. (I think I may have frustrated her with my pickiness!) Omg! This was the best suv and downgrading from a full size pickup to this wasn't much of a change either. I got a great deal and it had under 100000 miles, it will probably still run like a top after the next 100000 I put on it. Just one weakness other than the window regulator recall, wheel bearings go bad if you use 4x4 a lot, which I do, oh and they aren't serviceable you have to replace the hub assembly. Other than that this is better by far than I imagined.
UPDATE>>>going on my fifth year with this same vehicle and its still running strong, the straight 6 is amazing for my gas mileage and I am getting ready to roll over to 170000 miles still purring like a kitten.  ALAS the hub assemblies every other year....rear wiper motor, window washer sprayer, and head lamp relay, only other problems so far;)

At 34,000 miles the fuel guage stop working (i had it fixed $800 because I have small children and did not want to be standed with them).
At 45,000 my battery, alternator and now the computer just went so nothing will blow out the vents,
In the past 3 weeks I have put $1,000 into the car.

gmc,envoy,2007,jap, 08/01/2007,Love it!,4,"After many weeks of searching the internet for the perfect vehicle for me, I finally chose the GMC Envoy. Not only did I love the looks, but the ride is very quiet and smooth. "
gmc,envoy,2007,tireguy, 11/15/2016,They don't make them like this anymore!,4,"A lot of people can't tell the difference between what they're calling full-size SUVs now, and what they called mid-size SUVs in the 90s, but there is a major difference.  When the popularity of SUVs exploded in the 90s, vehicles like the Pathfinder, Explorer, and Durango were based on truck frames, meaning the body basically bolts onto a ladder which has a big engine in the front, a transmission bolted behind it, and a driveshaft going to the rear axle. Now those same vehicles have much more in common with minivans than they do with trucks.  Their construction is of a unitized body, which, rather than being a body bolted onto a proper backbone, is just a bit cluster of sheet metal with some stressed areas stamped with thicker stock.  It saves weight, which in turn saves gas.  In standard crash tests where it's the vehicle vs a concrete block, the safety compromise is negligible, but when two SUVs collide, one has massive beams spanning from bumper to bumper and a 500+ lb advantage in structural steel, and one has a body which is optimized for weight savings, how do you think that turns out?  The powertrain is also different, going from a large longitudinal-mounted engine powering a rear axle and an optional front axle, to a small transverse-mounted engine with a combined transaxle powering the front with the rear being the option.  So here you have the Envoy, the last of GMs mid-size SUVs possessing the guts of a truck.  It's built on a ladder frame, with the same basic engine (5.3L V8), transmission (4L60E) and rear axle (GM 8.6"" 10-bolt) as the Sierra/Silverado line of half ton pickups.  It's an expensive way to build trucks, and GM abandoned it with the introduction of the Acadia/Traverse ""SUVs.""  Most of the other mid-size SUVs, such as the Explorer, Pathfinder, and Durango have followed suit.  Only the Toyota 4Runner still uses a ladder frame.  The true full-size SUVs (Suburban, Expedition, Land Cruiser) have retained the ladder frame, for now.  As far as our Envoy Denali goes, it's a fun vehicle to drive.  It's not especially spacious, not a fuel sipper, not the most luxurious, it's just a really cool vehicle for active people who don't have to carry a lot of stuff. Having owned this vehicle for 13 years now, I did two modifications to make it suit our needs: first, I added a jump seat in the rear from littlepassengerseats.com, which made it into a six person vehicle while still retaining a decent amount of cargo space.  And second, I installed a lift kit from BDS to allow larger tires.  The Envoy Denali is the only vehicle I know of which came with 245/60R18s, meaning there is almost no selection, and certainly no truck/SUV tires.  By raising it up 2 inches, and adding 1.5"" wheel spacers to the front, I was able to install the standard Chevy Silverado tires: 265/65R18.  The vehicle looks awesome, but still stock to the casual observer.  If you get the SLT, with the standard 17"" tires,  you'll have no problem finding tires, and the lift won't be necessary.  Personally, I only got the Denali because I wanted that beautiful LS-variant V8 in the short body (305 hp based on the Corvette LS motor of the early 2000s).  I was never really a fan of the bling, but love the bang.  Toward the end, they did make some SLTs in that configuration, through they seem kind of rare.  As far as major maintenance, it's needed nothing other than new rear suspension airbags at one point (about $200 each), and new front wheel bearings ($100 each).  It does have three annoyances, however: 1) the driver's door always made a ""thunk"" when going over large bumps, especially while turning left.  2) I've found the decapitated heads of three of the 10 exhaust manifold bolts on my garage floor throughout the years, all from corner positions--it's not leaking yet, but when it does, the job will be a real pain with that huge engine shoe-horned into that
 tiny compartment.  3) The Bose system makes a buzzing, interference sound from time to time, which goes away with a good whack of the center console.  I can live with those minor issues.

gmc,envoy,2007,j_eng, 02/15/2013,2007 Envoy 6 cycl,4,"There is no label for XT, SLE, or the other ID for the same 6 cyclinder Envoy. The 6 cyclinder provides the power and towing ability, gas mileage that I expected. I
get
18 city 21 on level highway. With 3 people ski gear, driving up mountains in thinner air it drops to 15.5 - 17MPG and that is with 4 snow tires. With 1 person and reducing weight by never carrying over 1/2 tank of gas and 35 PSI in the summer tires the mileage goes up. Loosing 4-6 MPG and gaining the power and towing ability for
mulch, logs, motor boat is worth it. The Suburu and Toyota Highlander's rating was false. with the weight of people, air drag it proved to be 25 MPG, never in the 30's."

This is a vehicle you can fall in love with.  It's a truck, on a ladder frame.  It handles like a truck and I like that.  It's got beautiful lines, lots of power, room inside, and a real hi/lo 4 wheel drive.  No compromises.  It's an all around great vehicle, and fits into my standard 2 car garage next to my Yukon XL perfectly.  It's really sad that they discontinued it this year.

High BB value.
Wanted SUV that ran like my Lexus.
Sounds like a tall order, but it does, mostly.
It has fast acceleration (@ 80 before you know it), smooth ride, comfortable, and a reliable motor.
My dislikes are: the 2007 doesn't have the wood trim like previous years, cup holders are weird, and I have the Base trim which means I lack a bunch of features (steering wheel controls, rear radio controls, heated seats ans mirrors, etc) which I hate.
But, overall I love my Envoy.
It's gorgeous in white with chrome trim (not sure why it doesn't have the Envoy nameplate on the door).
For my first SUV, I chose very well.

gmc,envoy,2007,mdelatorre, 08/23/2012,Gas Gauge Issue,4,I have reviews several reviews and know that I am not the only one experiencing this issue. I have a 2007 Envoy and have had issues with the gas gauge for a few months now. The gas meter will indicate that I am empty but I will have gas in the tank. I have determined that once i get about 1/2 a tank it tells me i am empty. Are thier any plans on recalling this problem that several of us are experiencing?
gmc,envoy,2007,Laz Castellanos, 07/10/2017,Envoy Denali,4,"If you are a GM fan you will love it, but if you are looking for an SUV that will satisfy your needs a little better go for a Ford Explorer. My Denali is a 07 and I like it don't get me wrong but I should have bought the Explorer,  let me start the compariso. My Denali has a 4 spd tranny the Explorer 6 spd, Denali side air bags optional, Explorer standard, Denali 5 passenger SWB Explorer 6-7 passenger, Denali tech ok, Explorer excellent, Denali handling not the best, Explorer very good (I've driven one of my customers 08 Explorer Limited),  back up sensors are not available on Envoys and come standard on Limited trims on Explorer and the list goes on. The active fuel management on GM products it is garbage and Denalis come with it not mentioning the suspension noises here and there even after replacing every single suspension component. Envoy Denalis are grate for long trips  (I live in the bay area and I've driven mine to Portland Oregon, Boise Idaho twice to San Diego CA six times and to Guadalajara Mexico once with zero problems) and they are ok for city driving. Guys I make my living  repairing automobiles and my Envoy gets the best of the best for its maintenance but I wish GM worked a little bit more on it before releasing it. By the way if you go for the Explorer get the V8 (bullet proof engine) instead of the senseless V6 (1mpg more on the V8). The Denali has been working for me because I'm able to fix the few things that go wrong my self and even as a technician I make mistakes purchasing vehicles but you don't have to. Envoy Denalis are not bad SUVs but drive a Explorer Limited if possible before pulling the trigger on the Denali.

 Purchased new in 8/07= 180,000 miles and the only thing I have ever had to replace is the Fuel Pump @ 70K.
I have routinely changed with
Synthetic Oil and Lucas Fuel Treatment additive.
I believe this truck easily has another 180,000+ miles left in it! "
gmc,envoy,2007,luvmytruck, 09/21/2007,One of the best I have ever owned,4,"I bought mine 1  year ago and now have 31000 miles on it. I have had all kinds of cars and one other SUV in the past 25 years ranging from Fords to Mercedes. The comfort is fantastic. The ride is solid, secure, sure,and quiet. You get behind the wheel and you feel safe, confident, and in command. It is not fun but I do not think it was meant to be. It is hardly a sports car. But, if you want something that is comfortable on the road for long stretches, solid, safe, roomy, powerful, versatile, this is it. Even my dog loves riding in the back (sometimes with one of his friends). I recently drove it from NY to NC and back with my fiancee and her son. The drive was so easy. I just love it.  "
gmc,envoy,2007,Ralph, 11/30/2006,Owner,4,An excellent all around vehicle. Very nice ride and very comfortable. Rides like a luxury car 
gmc,envoy,2007,Easy Choice, 05/11/2007,Easy Choice,5,"Purchased new the day after big snowstorm.The 4WD is awesome and unobtrusive - really gets the job done. Also took from Ohio to Florida and back, great road vehicle. Fuel economy didn't suffer despite speeds of, well, lets just say well north of 70 MPH during the entire trip. Tire pressure monitor system saved our bacon when we picked up a screw in a tire in GA. The alert allowed me to change the tire before it went down and destroyed itself. Really nice vehicle. This thing has awesome legroom. I'm 6"" and can totally stretch out. "
gmc,envoy,2007,Bill, 03/22/2016,WORST VEHICLE EVER !!! BEWARE OF GM/CHERVOLET !!!!,1,"Gave a 1 star because you have to pick something ! Purchased used with records, always in the shop ! Plagued by sensor, wheel bearing  & rust issues ! That is just the start ! I will never buy another GM/Chevrolet product ! They do not stand by their vehicles ! 2007 GM Envoy has nothing but problems !  I do not usually write reviews, but felt that  I  had to try and save perspective buyers of the aggravation ! I'm selling my Envoy for 3k less just to get it out my driveway !
"
gmc,envoy,2007,Salex, 10/11/2006,Great SUV. Bad Options,4,"You hear all the hype about GMC being ""Professional Grade"", don't believe it.  I purchased an '07 Envoy with a Nav System.  This Nav system is a waste of money.  It is DVD based like most, but the one thing that GMC did that all other makersdecided not to do was to only allow the in-dash unit to accept one disc at a time!  For a $2000 option, don't waste your money if you want to Nav and listen to your CDs!  Get the 6-disc in- dash and buy a TomTom or Garvin that rides on the dash. It is cheaper and better that way!"
gmc,envoy,2007,Justin, 09/17/2010,Air Bag Problem - Beware,2,"My 2007 Envoy Denali has had numerous computer/sensor issues. Reads tire pressure and gas incorrectly. Recently the air bags deployed without cause. The interior has $3,000.00 in damages caused from the driver and passenger side airbags deploying. The air bag deployment also resulted in my girlfriend being sent to the ER. There is absolutely no damage to the exterior. Poor manufacturing - beware!"
gmc,envoy,2007,Gary, 08/22/2008,I love this car,4,This is the 6th SUV I have owned. The others were Fords. I hesitated buying the car because of some review I read but I liked the looks of it so I bought it anyway. I have been extremely happy with the car. It drives and rides well. I have the Denali so it has about everything on it. I wouldn't call it a workhorse but in the Oregon where I live it fits the needs of the typical small family. 
gmc,envoy,2007,DWinMN, 02/06/2008,Envoy,4,"I purchased the Envoy after driving my 99 GMC Jimmy  nearly 200000 miles. After test driving competitor models, I returned to GMC for a vehicle with more features and more for my money. The Envoy has been flawless in performance. The mileage isn't the greatest but accelerating easy has me exceeding the estimated mpg. I am getting 16.5 mpg city and 22-23 highway. The Envoy has good visibility and drives off road reasonably well. I am still impressed by how comfortable the seats are. Storage and space is impressive. GMC just needs to add some of teh features of the Acadia and they will have the perfect mid size SUV."
gmc,envoy,2007,Lav_tip, 12/19/2006,Denali = Outstanding Value for your Money,4,"I really enjoy this vehicle.  I personally like the nav system and don't really care about the whole ""CD"" issue.  Oh by the way, I also own an '06 Lexus GS300 AWD and my wife owns an '06 RX330 and neither one of us listens to CDs. We do however enjoy our subscriptions to XM satellite radio. I test all the competitors products and found that the Denali was equivalent to the 4Runner, Pathfinder and the other American products as well.  I love driving this vehicle. I drove it from Herndon, VA to Knoxville, TN and it performed extremely well and was a very comfortable ride.  "
gmc,envoy,2007,Joe, 07/17/2007,Nice Ride,4,"I was hesitant to by an American made car since I always have driven a Toyota but so far I have been very impressed. The Envoy is very comfortable, has great pick up and go while sustaining very little road noise. So far, I am really impressed."
gmc,envoy,2007,alventura160, 11/06/2007,Better than the 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser,4,"I was very hesitant to purchase the Envoy because I was driving an extremely reliable 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser at the time. The FJ Cruiser was a fun vehicle to own, but there were a lot of design flaws I could not get past.  Most of all, the suicide doors made it very difficult for people to get in and out of the back seat. The Envoy provides such a quiet and comfortable ride.  My wife and I carpool to work most of the week, and we look forward to our morning and afternoon drives in our Envoy. I am fairly sure that the next car I purchase will also be a General Motors vehicle. I encourage anyone that is shopping for a safe and comfortable SUV to test drive the Envoy. "
gmc,envoy,2007,Ray, 11/09/2007,Luxury and power for a great price,5,"The Envoy Denali is a pleasure to drive because of it's luxury and performance.  Build quality is outstanding and the option packages include the DVD and Nav systems. Even though the Envoy is going to be replaced by the Acadia, it's still a great vehicle at an affordable price. I love the creature features and the safety and security of the front and side air bags."
gmc,envoy,2007,nettieg, 03/25/2012,2007 GMC Envoy Fuel Gauge,4,"I have driven (and love) my 2007 Envoy.
The truck is so comfortable & it has been 100% reliable for me.
I currently have 35,600 original miles on it.

It is a total disappointment to me that GMC refuses to pay for a replacement fuel gauge.
I sure can't afford to pay half ($325.00) for a new gauge anymore then anyone else can.
I tried to appeal to GMC because I am 60 years old & on Social Security Disability, but to no avail.
The company evidently does not care what sort of ""American made (???)"" parts suppliers it deals with. So for now, with gas at $3.95/gallon, I just top off the tank every 5 days.
I hope that at some point, a GMC executive drove the Envoy & ran out of gas. "
gmc,envoy,2007,suzie_q_757, 05/11/2012,Will never buy another GM!!,2,"I purchases my envoy about 1 1/2 yr ago and about 1 month later the airbag, oil pressure, stabli link, and gas sensors went out in it!! About 6 months ago I noticed that the bottom of the rear doors are rusting. I called GM and they say that since it is not rusting completly threw the doors yet it would not be covered under the corrosion warranty, but they will cover it as a courtosy? Really?!? Okay so after getting the approval I asked what im suppose to do while my vehicle will be in the bodyshop for a week and they said they do not cover rentals or loaner vehicles under the corrosion warranty!! [non-permissible content removed]! This vehicle has caused me nothing but headaces!! I will be trading this in! no more GM"
gmc,envoy,2007,Charles Gatewood, 09/29/2017,Cookie Cutter interior,4,"If you like cookie cutter interiors when it comes to colors then buy General Motors, I think people do it because that's all that's available. I have talk to people who think as I do the interior should be all one color, dashboard, headliner door panel steering wheel, seats, seat belts, carpet and roof support post. Back in the 70's I bought a 1973 Grand Prix Red On Red it even had a darker red Vinyl top everything inside the car was red. I took it in for service in 1975 and I fell in love with a 1975 Grand Prix that I saw on the showroom floor it was two tone Honduras red and Burgundy with a burgundy vinyl top the whole interior was Red I loved the looks of this car so much I ordered one I also ordered a Firebird for my wife beige with a light brown vinyl top and all beige interior. The Interiors and paint colors for most cars today are crap.  I think Kia and Lincoln finally got it somewhat right I just bought a 2017 Kia Cadenza Limited Brown on Brown and I saw a Lincoln Navigator that was cream color with all brown Interior.  Looks like some manufacturers are trying to bring it back where it should be GM should take notes.
"
gmc,envoy,2007,Lynda Smith, 04/02/2008,Not your quiet ride,3,I bought this SUV because I was really drawn to the style and outside appearance of the vehicle  I also fell in love with the interior. I have leased Nissan vehicles in the past and my husband talked me into looking at GMC. I thought it was everything I wanted in an SUV so we purchased the SUV instead of leasing. I travel on the highway 90% of the time and I was so disappointed in the wind noise of this vehicle I knew something had to be wrong. Why would you make such a classy vehicle and forget about quality. After taking it to the dealership three time we were told nothing is wrong with the vehicle that is just the quality of GMC.    
gmc,envoy,2007,Robert, 08/18/2018,Wonderful mid-size SUV,4,"This has been a very good vehicle for the 2 of us and our 2 dogs. Plenty of room and very comfortable. It rides high enough to see over many cars. I wish it had the ""driver assistance features"" available/standard on today's vehicles. As we've gotten older, we've found the running boards to be important. Our son has shown interest in getting this SUV when we are ready to move up. Might be soon!

gmc,envoy,2007,carlapappy, 07/13/2008,2007 GMC Denali,4,"I have to say, I went from a VW New Beetle to this beautiful GMC vehicle. I've only owned Chevy's in the past (excluding my short stint with the Bug), and I am so pleased that I purchased this SUV. No, the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but the satisfaction and pure enjoyment that I get out of driving everyday makes up for it.  I hope to have this car well over the 100k mileage mark as I travel from duty station to duty station across the U.S.  I am a proud owner of this GMC!  "
gmc,envoy,2007,40yearfan, 01/23/2008,Great work vehicle,4,"I just love this car.  It's like driving a Cadillac on a GMC budget.   Quiet, powerful and handles like a sports car.  It stops on a dime, corners better than any SUV I've ever driven and sticks to the road like glue even on rain-slicked highways.  With  it's high body placement, I have no problem driving on construction sites and don't have to worry about driving through a heavily rocked area or up/down a dirt embankment.   My last vehicle was a 2004 Buick Rainier.  This is the same GM body but it is miles ahead of the Rainier in every catagory.  If you want a truck with class and comfort, this is your ride."
gmc,envoy,2007,Jim Garrett, 07/27/2009,gmc Professional Grade? ? ?,4,Drastic improvements needed with cup holders - terrible wind noise - larger brake pedal - seat belt B pillar should be adjustable.  Good power good audio difficult GPS system throw it out and start over.  Use Mapqwest as a model. Nice interior fit and finish. Easy to drive and park. Inadequate sn visor size Use same as Tahoe. In general its a pretty good car with all the goodies but definitely NOT professional grade.
gmc,envoy,2007,Pat, 11/07/2009,I love my GMC Envoy Denali,4,"I purchased my GMC Envoy Denali a year ago. I looked at the Acura, Lexus and other SUV's but decided I liked the extra room the Envoy offered. It had 20,000 miles on it and it came as a pre owned certified vehicle. I LOVE it so much. There's not one thing that I dislike about it. I'm so glad that I purchased the Denali model as it offers so many outstanding upgrades, it's worth every dime that I paid extra for the Denali model. I have had no problems and love everything about it. I also love the OnStar option. It provides so much for the monthly cost, I could not live without that either!!"
gmc,envoy,2007,Cpersons, 02/04/2010,Love The Ride,4,"Leased this vehicle for 39 months and couldn't be happier! Love the ride love the dashboard, love everything! This car never gave me a problem, the only maintenance done was oil changes and tire rotation and car ran perfectly. I had to turn in the car 2 months ago and it was one of the worst days of my life! If your looking for a reliable suv this is the one to purchase"
gmc,envoy,2007,Linda, 03/01/2007,"Yeah, I found what I was looking for!",5,"Compared Rendezvous, Buick's new Acadia, and TrailBlazer. I was looking for smooth ride, and a vehicle that felt like if I step on the gas I wasn't taxing the vehicle.  \As soon as I test drove this I said ""this is it!"" Traded a 2005 Nissan Pathfinder LE with 30000 miles, don't miss it at all! Tried some foreign models, never felt like I had a solid car. You must try this vehicle if you are looking for a SUV. Not too big, not too small. My husband liked it so much, he traded his 2006 Ford for a new GM Sierra.  We will keep these for a long time. Both have the solid feel 40 somethings are looking for. Paid about the same as low and mid end foreign vehicles. Got better ride and quality."
gmc,envoy,2007,Orange County Cali, 04/05/2007,HighlyRecommend Envoy,5,"I would  highly recommend purchasing an Envoy Denali. I test drove a Toyota, Honda, and Nissan and were really dissapointed their quality of exterior styling, ride and handling, and est EPA. I love the 100,000 warranty, XM satellite radio and how quietly it drives with all that power!"
gmc,envoy,2007,Shuttle Bus, 03/30/2007,Recommend Envoy,5,"I would absolutely recommend an Envoy. The guy on the next review who can't figure out the NAV should take a second and read the owners manual. My 8 year old read the manual and figured out the NAV in 10 minutes. I have not had one problem with my Envoy. The quality is outstanding and it drives excellent. Compared to the Toyota, my Envoy is affordable, looks great, and I feel very safe driving it. GMC gives me a 100,000 mile warranty, and sends someone to fix my flat tire, for free! Now that's professional grade."
gmc,envoy,2007,RICK, 04/06/2007,Best value for your money,4,"I was very impressed with the comfort and performance of the 2007 Envoy, so I bought it. It drives very smooth and my kids enjoy the ride in the back seat. Even on railroad tracks or on pot holes, you almost do not feel the bumps. I am impressed with the fuel economy even though it has a lot of power. Excellent air conditioning for the hot summers. Great vehicle for the price, you won't get a better deal."
gmc,envoy,2007,JohnnyG, 04/12/2007,Roadmaster Delux,5,I bought it 03/22 I have about 2200 miles and they are excellent miles. This is a road machine. You sit up in a commanding position. Ride comfort and handling prowess are superior. It has a very confident and agile feel to it while rolling down the highway. Has 18 wheels and responds very well to rapid moves. The inline 6 cy 4.2 liter with 291hp is extremely responsive when you need it. The Envoy is a very quiet comfortable ride. Wind and road noise are minimal. Gas mileage is not bad. This is an outstanding vehicle for the price.GMC has built a quality vehicle with quality parts. Fit and finish is second to none in its class

gmc,envoy,2007,adam, 06/30/2007,Ready to sell,3,"This is my second Envoy, my first was a 2002. It had massive engine problems at 2000 miles and after I totaled it from hitting a deer, I got a new one. I primarily got it for the high comfort great looks. It has little problems that make it spend days at the shop. It has also lost most of its value over the 5 months I've owned it. I would not buy another but I would rather buy an American car rather than some Honda or Toyota."
gmc,envoy,2007,r wind, 06/16/2007,A pleasure to drive,4,"After driving a '98 Tahoe for 9 years, with its poor brakes, poor gas mileage, and sloppy handling, it has been a real pleasure to experience the performance of my 2007 Envoy Denali. The 5.3 litre V8 out performs the 5.7 in my 98 by far and the gas mileage is at least 30% better around town. I haven't found anything I don't like about the car. Well, just one, no glove box light."
gmc,envoy,2007,bobo, 11/10/2007,Happy In California,4,The Envoy performs very well. It is Great on handling and is roomy. The Navi and back seat radio and air conditioning only make it better.
gmc,envoy,2007,John K., 04/30/2008,Does all things well and looks great,4,"We've had mostly fords,after 10 yrs with a 97 GMC Safari AWD & no issues we decided to look at GMC. Our 96 Lincoln continental 96 was nothing but trouble & poorly built so we didn't consider Ford. We tried the new Saturn Outlook and found it to be ""too large"" & the cost w/options too high. We test drove the Toyota Highlander & offroad Toyota as well as the Nissan SUV. The Toyota was souless & they wouldn't negotiate. The Nissan was ok but the interior was bland. We chose the Envoy Denali because we wanted the towing capability, durability of a truck and the better fuel mileage the Denali's 8 cylinder with 4 cylinder cutout offered. We average 18 in city and 22 hywy. 1 yr later we r 100% hapy"
gmc,envoy,2008,phoenixiv, 02/25/2015,2008 Envoy Winter Driver,3,"Just bought the wife a winter driver because the Toyota Corolla Sport can't even make it out of the driveway if it has 2 inches of snow or more. The Envoy is stable, dependable and with automatic or full time 4 wheel drive it plows through snow and ice covered roads well. Most of the time it turns around in the drive with 5-6 inches of fresh snow without 4 wheel drive engaged. The vehicle has a smooth heavy feel on the highway more like a 1/2 ton truck which we both like but it has a softer ride. Great leg room for me for a change which fits my 6' 1"" frame better than most of the smaller crossovers or SUVs. The 4.2L inline six has good power and torque at both low and high speeds."
gmc,envoy,2008,Bill Poindexter, 07/08/2015,ENVOY SLT Solid as Stone Mountain,5,"We purchased our 2008 GMC Envoy SLT with 10,000 miles on it and one year old.  Now we have over 250,000 on it and would not trade it for anything new and free.  The best way to describe the old school, body on frame, straight six SUV is SOLID.  For work I have the opportunity to rent many vehicles and nothing comes close to the solid feel and stump pulling power of GM's Envoy and Trail blazer twin.  My brother in law is a master mechanic and shop owner and rather than purchase a new vehicle (which he could easily afford)  he chose a well cared for Trail Blazer.  He is highly impressed with the bullet proof power train rugged body on frame design.  I can attest it feels like you are driving a SUBSTANTIAL vehicle.  The mass of power available at the slightest touch of the gas verifies what I read.  The truck engine in these SUVs were over built by GM.  The solid axle always stays put and signals when you are adrift in the lane resulting in a reassuring ride and stable tracking regardless of the highway condition.  Newer vehicle designs may give you more storage pockets and cup holders but I value solid construction and indestructible power train as more important for getting you from A to B.  Comfort is exceptionable and everything is quiet and solid inside the car.  Repairs have been limited to a cracked exhaust manifold and wires chewed up by a demented squirrel.  I would strongly lean toward buying a well cared for Envoy over a new vehicle just because they simply don't build them like this any more.  UPDATE AS OF 1-13-17----  Our Envoy has now 250000 miles on it.  Everything still works.  Have not had to fix or replace anything, (no lie).  Still has the original muffler, shocks, A/C freon.  I change the oil and have had all other fluids changed as advised by GM.  A great great car.

gmc,envoy,2008,flyer1977, 07/25/2013,Love my new Used Envoy,4,"Just a couple days old, I bought this 2008 Envoy with 65000 miles on it.
I went to purchase a 2009 Chevy Equinox.
Ironically both sat side by side and were the same price, yet the envoy had 20000 less miles.
From the exterior, the GMC looked to be more solid of a vehicle, it doesnt have that plastic look to it like the Equinox.
Test drive the transmission shifts smooth and no fear of passing on the highway.
Equinox was otherwise.
Gas mileage better than I expected.
Last night did a 115 mile drive on the highway at 65-70 mph, got 22mpg with the air condition on.
I was expecting a SUV of this size to be in the teens, its a truck no one should expect 30 mpg.
So far I love it"
gmc,envoy,2008,Stonebank, 10/08/2016,Own. Purchased with 3K miles in 2008 at dealer.,5,"Maintaining this vehicle is not cheap, but doing the preventive maintenance is a lot cheaper.  Having a four wheel drive vehicle gives you two differentials to maintain instead of one plus the transfer case.  I have run nothing but Mobil I oil in it, and perform the recommended mechanical work earlier than recommended using the best material possible.  My vehicle looks new, and runs like a well tuned watch even with 157,000 miles.  I have my own maintenance schedule that has kept every car I have owned in great shape for many years with hardly a breakdown (which I blame on ethanol).  Change hoses every three years with a coolant flush, change the battery every three years with the best you can buy, replace any potential defective wiring as noticed, and change oil every 5-7000 miles running only synthetic regardless of climate.  Replace all brakes before damaging rotors, and ensure the rotors are the best duty you can keep on the car, rotate tires with every oil change, and put the best tires on the vehicle possible.  A few extra bucks here can save thousands.  Update mechanicals as noted by a GOOD mechanic.  I use a high quality dealership, and the repair prices are not really any higher, and the mechanics are well trained and supervised.  My only real comfort negative is short seats which is common in most cars these days.  I have long legs and lack of proper thigh support creates a painful butt and hamstrings on longer rides.  My car has performed pretty much flawlessly.

over again.  She is an absolute sweetheart - the Envoy Denali is a great road-suv...hugs the road - runs down 
the road at 80 mph - 2,000 rpm - 20 miles per gallon - comfort and just plain FUN TO DRIVE.

This is my 7th GMC product and I am just now ordering a new GMC Acadia Denali - 2017 - I just hope the new

Monthly payment was getting to much so had to downsize to a small car again, but looking forward to being back in a FORD Focus again.  Anyone who has mentioned the seats don't fold down flat, WELL THEY DO.  We didn't think so at first either until my husband went out one day and figured it out, reading the manual really helped too.

gmc,envoy,2008,Mrs. T, 04/28/2008,Nice Ride,4,"I know I am not the norm, I had my previous car for 12 years.  Yes, 12 years.  I only had 106,000 and cried like a baby when I sold it to a friend of mine.  I have looked at the Envoy since 2004 and decided this was the year to buy it.  (Also the last year they are making them)  I love my Silver Mist color, have had many a compliment when out driving.  I have a sunroof and the nice stereo.  I just put 1000 miles on it this weekend.  I am kinda disapointed in the gas mileage but I guess it is to be expected with an SUV.  I love the staightline 6 I have, it has a lot of get-up-and-go.  So in short, love it!!!"
gmc,envoy,2008,vallywally, 11/08/2009,Love the Denali but not the Mileage,4,"Hwy mpg is OK but city mpg is very poor. The seat belt cuts into my neck and needs to be repositioned. Denali exterior is an eye turner but the plastic ""woodgrain"" console looks cheap and tacky. Seats are comfortable but would prefer a softer leather. When I'm stopped for a light, after 10+ seconds there's a thud-like jolt & sound from under the car. Dealer has no idea what is causing this but has heard others complain about it. "
gmc,envoy,2008,russ weaver, 04/24/2016,why don't they build this anymore?,5,"This vehicle is a mid size suv on a solid full frame. Handles rough terrain and freeway speeds equally well. I'd buy a new one if I could.

gmc,envoy,2008,John J, 11/12/2019,Awesome SUV,5,"I love my SUV. I bought it Used with 143,000 +. service Engine Light was on for Secondary  Air Injection Pump. I read up on that part and found out about condensation in hose under the truck. I pulled he hose off and got a little over a pint of water. I ordered and replaced that part for 56.00. Not $700 as I saw in 1 post. As far as gas mileage it's not as bad as what everyone is posting. Local driving isn't the best but what car really is driving short distance with stop & go traffic. On the highway using Sunoco gas I can get 325 to 360 miles on a tank of gas because I always use the cruise control and keep my distance from other vehicles by going 5 miles slower so I don't have to keep hitting the brakes. I LOVE this SUV. It's an 04 with 159,350 miles on it. Rides just as good as a new Cadillic or other fancy cars. GMC should start building these again with the Inline 6.. I don't know what gas the others are using in their.

Stabilitrack service light, dealer changed a sensor; 5. occasional loud Bumping/growling noise at RF wheel, dealer said normal operation; 5. speaker buzzing (out of warranty), Non-dealer replaced rear HVAC control; 6.

gmc,envoy,2008,Milez5858, 10/20/2009,Good power but that's where the good end,2,"I bought the Envoy as the most powerful 6 cylendar for towing.

The air shocks were constantly pumping up, the fans for the climate control extremely loud, there is no vent setting so it was either blowing hot or cold air, wind noise was excessive, the gas tank is configured such that it always spilled over when filling no matter what gas station I went to. Passing gear was great but taking of from stopped was very slow for a 280 hp engine."
gmc,envoy,2008,mph33, 06/10/2008,NIce vehicle for the price,4,This is the second Envoy we bought. My wife is the primary driver. The last one we had was the 4 wheel drive SLT. Very pleased with the pricing and is an excellent family SUV. The 8 cylinder gives it more power and does not really effect the gas mileage. Much better than the 6 cylinder in our last one.
gmc,envoy,2008,bellasarah, 12/15/2007,Love my GMC Envoy..but not the gas..,4,"I love my Envoy, but want to just say that I filled it up to full just two days ago and only put 120 miles on it and am already on a half tank. I just bought this SUV and I knew that the gas wasnt that great, but at this rate I am going to be filling up probably every week just to get to work and back. If GMC came out with a hyrbid Envoy that would be awesome."
gmc,envoy,2008,mmchis, 03/30/2008,Love my 2008 GMC,4,"It rides very smooth. I enjoy the comfortable seats. I like all the extras! The wood grain center console and steering wheel are beautiful. I would like more storage available in the center console. I like that the vehicle uses 4 cylinders, until it needs the full 8. It helps with gas mileage."
gmc,envoy,2008,hiflier, 05/07/2008,2008 Envoy Denali,4,"I got the Nav Package. In contrast to another review, I think it works great! Yes, there is a learning curve, but once you are proficient it works fine! Save for the XM traffic report - it does not have. I have owned previous Nav systems with this feature and it is great! We get comments all the time on how wonderful the vehicle looks - it looks like GM hit the mark on this vehicle. My wife drives is the primary driver and she absolutely loves this car over the Saturn ION we traded for it. Yes, the gas mileage went down with the trade, but the ride and the sense of feeling safe in a larger vehicle was worth the trade-off!"
gmc,envoy,2008,Willie Ringstaff, 10/10/2019,I love the hell out are this suv,5,"Buy this SUV it a great ride
"
gmc,envoy,2008,alc13, 07/22/2009,2008 envoy,3,"Not sure if I have the SLE or SLT. I rated the gas milage poor because it is extremely inconsistant. I travel 6 hrs interstate/highway time per week and I go the same speed every time.  Some trips I go through a little over a 1/4 and sometimes I go through a whole tank. Thats a huge difference! Also, it should get better milage than a truck 17mpg just doesn't cut it for its size. I rated the interior design poorly also because there is only one cup holder, back seats don't really fold down, console is tiny, and the computer system randomly turns on and off the change oil light.  As far as build quality stuff I had to have the powertrain completely replaced when I first bought it."
gmc,envoy,2008,Mary kay, 10/09/2018,Fixer upper,3,"Not great cant read the codes computer reading error. Like its been wet. Speedometer went out.

gmc,envoy,2008,Don't get the NAV, 12/17/2007,Don't get the Nav,3,"Spent the extra money on a NAV system only to find out that to use the nav system a dvd has to be in your cd player anytime that you are using it. In other words FM or XM only while navigating. I have used many different portable navigation devices that are so much more user friendly than this one. It is all that I can do to figure this thing out, my wife gave up after several very frusterating attempts. Save the money and buy a garmin! Also cup holders are a joke in this thing.The money I saved still outweighs these setbacks. GM blew away competitors prices! If I had to do over again I would buy the same vehicle without the nav,We would miss the touch screen FM/XM that comes with the nav."
gmc,envoy,2008,Smokey, 08/28/2008,My Envoy,4,"I traded in a 2007 Chevy Silverado crew cab that got 24 to 26 miles per gallon. My Envoy gets terrible gas mileage which is a bummer. Steering is hard to get used to, my truck was much smoother. Envoy is quiet as was my truck. I guess if you want something that is quiet, smooth, and gets good mileage buy a Silverado crew cab. Costs less than the Envoy and has much more room inside."
gmc,envoy,2008,choppers70, 04/22/2008,My favorite in the price range,4,I drove just about everything I thought I could get off the lot in the low $20K's. Everything felt like plastic junk. When I got in the Envoy I knew it was the one I wanted. Felt like luxury but in my price range. So far so good.  Some minor issues with rattling noises that need fixed but other than that I'm pretty happy with it.
gmc,envoy,2008,Glenn, 08/18/2008,Never Thought I Would Buy A GM Car,4,"Never thought I would buy American let alone a GMC car.  Drove the Envoy and it knocked my socks off. I'm hooked.  OnStar is a winner and the car is fantastic. Only problem, I understand it goes away next year. The Arcadia is the replacement and a car I would never buy."
gmc,envoy,2008,woodbine, 09/10/2008,Envoy Denali,4,I find the Envoy Denali to be a very wonderful product from GM. I recently had a 04 Trailblazer and the Envoy has a better ride style and the Denali package is excellent.  
gmc,envoy,2008,bigb4334, 11/18/2008,Nice Value SUV,4,"I love the power that the V8 offers in this size of an SUV. I would agree with some that turning is very soft with this vehicle, but some like the smoothness that it gives you. I have yet to tow something with it, but can't wait. Bose stereo is great, and OnStar turn by turn is also great.  With the pricing that they have for these vehicles right now, there isn't a better deal.  "
gmc,envoy,2008,215Denali, 03/09/2008,Great Truck,4,"An excellent truck for the price. The Denali trim level looks great, we get compliments all the time. Great looking interior, we have the black leather with wood grain."
gmc,envoy,2008,WD, 03/23/2008,Smooth & Quiet,4,"I previously owned other SUVs which road like trucks and were noisy on long rides. The Envoy has great power and better than the sticker fuel economy, 18 average, 20 or better on a trip. Seating is comfortable and OnStar works well.  "

"
gmc,envoy,2009,big red, 12/31/2009,Why did they stop making the envoy,4,I have owned new suv's for almost 20 years.  Many makes and models.  The envoy is the best in it's size. Where else can you find a  4x4 that will pull over 5000 pounds and still have all the creature comforts. I was driving a low mileage trail blazer when i found out they were stopping the envoy and trailblazer.  I immediately started looking for a 4x4.  it took almost a month before the right suv and deal came in. Why GM stopped making it is one of many reasons GM is in trouble.  They felt that the Acadia was a replacement...Go drive one and you will find out how bad it's visability is and lack of towing.
gmc,envoy,2009,Jim Nolan, 04/01/2019,Great vehicle,5,"I own a 2009 GMC Envoy. I pull a 22ft Key West boat with it. I would like to replace it but can't find any SUV under $55k that will measure up to my Envoy. Its very comfortable and is a great vehicle.
"
gmc,envoy,2009,RMS, 01/08/2009,2009 4WD GMC Envoy SLT,4,"I enjoy the upgraded cabin and seating. Controls are very ergonomic, and bluetooth is a real plus for this car. Sound system is top notch. Good acceleration and braking. 4WD is a dream. Broke the SUV in with a 2000 mile trip and initial gas mileage was 18 mpg for city/highway. GM finally got the Envoy/Trailazer right, and they discontinue it. Go figure."
gmc,envoy,2009,wns808, 08/30/2011,"Good, but more could've been done from '02-'09",3,"Used to have an '09 Envoy SLE 4 wheel drive, loved the car but due to financial reasons I traded this vehicle in for a more affordable, efficient vehicle.
 The drive was smooth, Bose stereo was good, even a Hitch came standard although I never used it."
gmc,envoy,2009,Shay, 07/21/2009,Love My Denali,4,"We had a 2007 Envoy Denali and liked it so well that when our lease was up we purchased a 2009 Envoy Denali  -  Cream of the crop - dependable, decent gas mileage and ride.  No problems here!"
gmc,envoy,2009,John, 03/02/2010,Needs more cup holders,3,This vehicle only has 2 cup holders for driver and passenger.  The trailblazer has 3.  There is only carpet for your left foot bump out on drivers side.  The trailblazer had a cover over the carpet.  The drivers seat is to big.  It makes it difficult to get at the pockets in the door.  The front bumper is flawed.  There is no foam behind the bumper.  In two spots where there is a support the metal pushes against the bumper causing it to bulge out.  Car was only 2 months old when this was noticed.   Dealer was suppose to replace bumper but they bondo'd the bumper.  You could see where it was bondo'd.  I had a fit.  
gmc,envoy,2009,Terry G, 08/23/2020,Denali is classy,4,Just bought a used Envoy Denali. Sharp looking inside & out. Powerful 5.3L 8 cylinder engine provides plenty of zip. Negatives- cup holders are too small as are the front door pockets. Wish this vehicle came with a backup camera. 
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,michael l, 09/06/2008,How do you treat your GMC?,3,"I purchased my 2002 GMC Envoy 4 years ago with 43k miles on it. The only maintainance I have done is change the oil, brakes, and tires. Sometimes I will wash it. This has been the most reliable SUV I have ever owned. How do other people drive and maintain? Easy on the gas and this SUV will take care of you. I currently have 188,468 miles on it and still runs as smooth as butter. It is a 2002. 8 years later and still runs like new. Time to buy a new and pass this to my daughter."

then the heated seats went out, then it 
was the power mirrors, then it was the 
windshield wipers.  Sorry to say that 
for the commercials on TV this is far 
from professional grade.  I plan on 
trading mine in as soon as I find 
something other than a GMC to turn my 
head.  Hope everyone elses is ok I

Everything works fine, ride is great, carries 7 avg. sized men with room for a large cooler. Great gas mileage, 24+ highway and 17+ around town.  On occasion will shift from 2wd to AWD for no reason. Mechanic has looked at twice. This has actually been in the shop less than my friend's 2002 Acura TL. I have back problems and the driver's seat is the best around for the electric adjustable lumbar support. Overall very pleased with this vehicle."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,Graciegurl, 08/08/2002,Professional Grade???,3,"After wanting to move out of minivan 
land and into an SUV I chose the Envoy 
XL.  As soon as I test drove it I knew 
this vehicle was for me.  Mistake 
number one.  Although I love the ride, 
comfort and convenience it offers the 
GMC professional grade claim doesn't 
hold ture.  My Envoy XL has been 
plagued by trouble as soon as I wrote 
the check and tried to drive it off the 
lot.  Trusting they would repair it and 
make it right was mistake number two.

year the car has been in the service

working, a/c broke twice and still 
having problems with it, car 
turned off by itself a few times, rear 
noise (transmission or differential 
joints were replaced), fan clutch 
replaced; wind noise is terrible in 
this vehicle, cracking noise on the

taken to the dealer for this problem)
and a few other items I can't remember

quality wise sucks!!
GM could have done a better job."

that stopped working; two recalls; 
running boards falling off; possessed 
wipers that do what they want when 
they want; a speedometer that says I'm 
driving 100 mph in my neighborhood.  
Absolutely ridiculous stuff for a 
brand new car. And the service tech 
said all I have to do when the a/c 
goes out is take out the fuse, wait 5 
minutes and reinsert it!!!  If that 
isn't adding insult to injury, I don't 
know what is! "
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,Tris, 04/30/2005,"Good Truck, but has problems",3,"My family got this truck about three years ago and for the first year and a half the truck was wonderful with no problems. Soon after that, we started having many problems. The brake lights go out all the time because of the wires or something. That problem was on going for about a year, I know they recalled it. Know problems under the hood are starting to surface and the things that are not working are very expensive. The car overall is good for that first year but after that it might be a good idea to trade it in, but is a great vehicle other than the problems. Overall this is not a truck you would buy if you were planning to keep it and then give it to your kids. I was expecting to at least get five years out of it."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,Raven789, 07/14/2004,Non-Professional Grade,3,"Bought my Envoy XL in Aug. of 2002 and 
it has been in the shop 9-times.  Had 
the A/C compressor replaced twice, 
power steering pump once, rear shock 
replaced, On-Star system repaired, 
cracked fuel tack replace at 5k 
miles.  I am very unhappy with GMC and 
this truck.  I went from a 4Runner and 
will never buy a GMC again!  Marketing

The dual memory feature has been a joke! The passenger mirror is in a new position everytime you turn the key! The dealership as normal is less than helpful. Will definitely trade for a European or Asian AWD vehicle and never look back. Nice Job GM, you lost another one!!  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,MCliff, 10/09/2002,Disappointed in the Reliablility,3,"We purchased our Envoy XL SLT 
approximately 2 months ago after much 
research into 7-passenger SUVs.  
Although we love the comfort, styling, 
and features of this vehicle, we have 
been very disappointed in its 
reliability.  We have had it in for 
service 4 times in two months.  The 
problems have involved the fuel line 
and fuel system (2 separate repairs), 
the solenoid, and the wiper mechanism
(replaced wiper module after wipers and 
windshield wash squirters would not 
turn off).  Needless to say, at this 
price and with a brand-new vehicle, we 
have been more than disappointed."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,JB14, 07/03/2004,GMC Envoy XL SLT,4,"This vehicle is excellent in winter - 
it's a good solid vehicle and very 
dependable as well as comfortable.  

I always had a problem with the view - 
some very big blind spots, which are 
to be expected with a bigger vehicle 
but, they also existed when looking 
for traffic when crossing a road.  I'd 
look one second and not see anything 
and look again and a car would be 
whizzing by me.  Maybe it's just the 
way I sat in the car but, it was also 
the thickness and tilt of the window 
as well as the oversized mirror with 
the Not Used OnStar stuff - a smaller 
rear view mirror was not an option at 
the time of purchase.
I liked the vehicle but never 
got over the view"
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,toytruckman, 09/08/2008,Another great GM vehicle,4,"I bought this Envoy XL new and love it. It has hauled trailers, doors, 2X4s, furniture and many other things including 7 passengers. This vehicle has only been back to the dealer twice and once was for a beauty item that I didn't like the looks. Sadly, it is time for a new vehicle (every 7 years as the GM credit card dollars start to expire)and I do not like the replacement Acadia due to the back glass not opening."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,okie, 07/29/2002,gmc envoy xl one fine vehicle,5,"Purchased XL in late June and drove on 
400 mile trip one week later. The Envoy 
was a pleasure to drive. It is very 
comfortable, rides extremely smooth and 
quiet, gets good mileage for its size 
ant the DVD is a cool extra. My wife 
drives it daily and loves it. Only 
problem so far is water leaked into 
left rear tailight assembly. Would 
highly reccomend the XL."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,C17 Load, 08/02/2002,Envoy XL SLE The best,4,"My wife and I recently bought our Envoy 
XL SLE with the 1SJ package. I must 
tell all of you that this is by far and 
away the best SUV that I have ever 
bought or owned. We also tested the 
Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT, but it did 
not compare as far as ride, options for 
the price, and it did not seem as well 
built. The 1SJ package is basically all 
the works to include the DVD player for 
the kids. Well worth the money, 
especially if you have multiple 
children. Plenty of room and a dream to 
drive. Would not consider any other SUV 
for the price, room, options, or ride. 
Simply put, the best SUV for the 
price!!!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,uncleb20, 08/16/2002,Moving along,4,"I waited until GMC came out with the 
XL edition for the third seat 
capacity; however, the biggest 
advantage is the smoother ride that 
the additional wheel base offers.  
Exterior detail is easy on the eye and 
makes the truck look bigger than it is."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,DarkCat44, 04/11/2002,WOW !!!,4,"We purchased the Envoy XL with the 1SJ 
package.  The ride in the Envoy XL is 
incredible.  Bumps, train tracks are 
non existant.  I am more than pleased 
with the comfort of all the seats.  My 
kids love the DVD player.  Callers on 
the cell phone have to ask if I'm 
driving because they don't hear any 
road noise.  I'd tested the Explorer, 
Durango, Trailblazer and Highlander 
they don't compare to the XL.  The best 
feature according to my wife is that it 
still fits in the garage.  After all 
the research and time spent testing I 
know that we made the best choice."

gmc,envoy-xl,2002,zinkv, 04/25/2002,GMC's Best Yet,4,"Envoy XL SLT w/4WD and all options 
except DVD and chrome wheels.  
Ride is exceptionally smooth and the 
handling is good, if not X5 caliber; 
the 270 HP V-6 pulls strong and steady 
without hesitation.   Only complaint is 
an occassional squeak on rough 
roads...not sure if it is from a seat 
or the chassis.  Otherwise, the vehicle 
has exceeded expectations except fuel 
economy.  Rated 15 City and 
20 Hwy, but so far getting 13/19.  
Expect that will improve with break-in 
(only 600 miles).  Considered the Acura 
MDX, Sequoia and Mountaineer.  At this 
point, I'm happy with my choice and the 
value for the price paid.  I still 
worry about eventual resale value."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,Rick Ruth, 05/08/2002,The Best Vehicle I Have Ever Owned!,4,"For a sport utility, the Envoy XL rides 
like a luxury sedan, and has all the 
comfort of some of the best luxury 
vehicles.  It is easy to drive and 
rarely ever feel a bump in the road.  
My wife insists that her back feels 
better after riding in the Envoy.  I 
originally intended on getting the 
Yukon, but after driving the Yukon it 
felt more like a truck and did not have 
the comfort of the Envoy.  In addition, 
I do city driving and the Yukon is much 
wider than the Envoy, but the Envoy 
with a third row seat gives you the 
same seating without the bulky size.  
Overall, an EXCELLENT sport utility."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,Healthguy, 05/09/2002,A bute!,4,"This vehicle is sooooo nice.  Just 
about every feature you can think of is 
laid out in a consistant, sophisticated 
manner.   I am very tall and the XL has 
great headroom.   With the regular 
Envoy, my sightline had me looking into 
the bottom part of the visor.  The XL 
is taller, even with the Sunroof.   The 
back seats are incredibly easy to get 
things in and out of.  The 3rd row has 
more room that most Standard SUV's 1st 
row.   Very excited to have this loaded 
XL.  Have the Black SLT with moon roof, 
chrome wheels, and Dealer installed 
DVD.  

Pleasantly Surprised that I average 
about 15mpg.  Thought it would be more 
like 12."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,rj12345, 05/21/2002,Terrific so far!,5,"I just bought an Envoy XL with 1SK last 
week, much to the horror of my import- 
loving friends and family. So far, I 
can't find any faults with it. Very 
powerful engine - accelerates smoothly, 
handles and drives like a car, with the 
capacity and towing capability of a 
true SUV.  The only thing better in the 
Acura MDX is the navigation capability. 
The Honda Pilot will be similar but 
lower priced (before greedy dealers 
start marking up over MSRP). The Toyota 
Sequoia is a little more spacious but 
to get it similarly equipped will cost 
almost $8K more, and you lose about 4 
MPG. Other 7-seater SUVs: Ford Explorer 
and Dodge Durango - their designs seem 
dated in comparison to the Envoy."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,Supamonk, 05/29/2002,WOW!,5,"This has changed my entire outlook on 
SUV's! Previously i had a '97 Chevy 
Tahoe LT and i always felt that it was 
too big. The XL is the same size, but 
the way they designed it made it feel 
much smaller. I've gotten it with 
nearly as many features as my husband's 
LOADED Cadillac DTS, and it drives 
almost as smoothly. Its sold at a great 
price too, several thousand less than 
most comparable SUV's. This is a great 
car and I love it."
gmc,envoy-xl,2002,Kevbo, 06/12/2002,"So far, great",5,"Once I got used to driving a much 
bigger car than the old Jimmy, I 
couldn't think of any other car to 
drive!  My wife and I are now fighting 
over it, and the kids want to just sit 
inside and watch DVD's.  So far, not 
one flaw and seems to get about 22 mpg 
on the fwy. GMC seems to have a winner. 
My only comlaint is that they added a 
new incentive AFTER I bought the car!"

is an attractive and comfortable SUV 
that delivers in smoothness and fuel 
economy.  The ability to carry 7 
adults is a big plus. Unfortunately, 
GMC's spotty reliability keeps me from 
recommending this vehicle to anyone.  
We have had vehicle for three months 
and it has been in for service 5 
times.  First, alignment was out, 
shortly afterwards the vehicle 
developed a vibration at around 70 
mph, two weeks later the AC quit 
working and just recently the rear end 
started making a humming sound and 
will need to be replaced.  Get an

I stay up on all maintenance: fluids, S-belt, brakes pads & rotors, coil overs, shocks, fuel filter, ball joints& driver front wheel bearing (I consider maintenance). The only non-maintenance repairs have been replacing plastic upper molding on rear door the power steering pump (reservoir leaking, did not fail), tensioner pulley & water pump, all just this year 2014. I really cant say enough good about her. One of the best SUVs ever built!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,JMellies, 01/12/2016,Used Purchase,4,"I've only had my Envoy for a couple of months & did not buy from a very reputable used car dealer, but I love this vehicle. It's got enough get up & go off a stop to keep me from laying my foot into the gas too heavy. The previous owner seemed to not care much about the mechanical integrity of this vehicle since I had to make the dealer replace the wiring harness, then I ended up having to have the transmission completely rebuilt a couple months later. Despite that, this engine is as solid as a tank. There is nothing like an inline 6 motor! I fancy myself a shade tree mechanic and this is by far one of the easiest engines to work on. With 162k miles on it, & counting, I plan to keep her around for another 162k now that she's got a new transmission & a solid engine.

As a short-waisted woman, I LOVE the adjustable driver seat. I can see all around me, I get proper lumbar support, I don't have to be on top of the steering wheel to reach the pedals, & don't need an extra pad to raise my short self up to see past the end of the hood. As a Lyft driver, I get a lot of compliments on how comfortable my vehicle is & how easy it is to get in & out of, even from the rear set of seats. I plan to use this beast to do some beach camping this year.

Update: she's still going strong with 190k miles on her now. The cables for the odometer, speedometer, & gas gauge need to be replaced. Her age is starting to manifest in the little things, but still a very solid ride.

2and update: still love my girl, but damn these emissions sensors! Haven't been able to get the damn check engine light to shut off in 3 years. Replaced every single sensor in her. Most likely due to the two broken bolts in the exhaust manifold which you can't get to without special tools or pulling the engine. Neither of which is an option for me. Even tried using right angle drill. Broke a bit & stripped two extractors to no avail. Thank god for high temperature gasket seal, but my stupid self only sealed around those two bolts thinking the normal gasket would be fine around the rest. Soooooo, I have to pull the whole thing a third time & seal the whole mess this time. Hopefully that will buy me time to save to fix her up since I'm in the process a conversion for camping. Ripped out the two rear seats & built a small bed frame, cut down my old tempurpedic mattress & now have a very comfortable but tiny RV for my trips. Solar on the roof with battery & converter for powering my laptop for business on the go from wherever I want to be.

I've had to replace the fan clutch ($600), the arm rest (my fault - $70) and something else that I can't remember the name of but it may be called the driveline (?).

In which I had to purchase myself (dealer did not pay for replacing them the day that I bought it). That should have told me something right there. Well, few days later, I notice the emergency brake doesn't work either. Shortly after, my air conditioning motor quit working. That cost me over $500.00.

We already have the electronic circuit needing replacement.  Apparently, that's to blame in the repeated blow out of the rear break lights.

the group."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,spinky, 06/10/2003,03 Envoy XL,4,"Compared all of the six to seven 
passenger vehicles including Ford, 
Chrysler, Honda, Toyota and the 
features of the Envoy, looks, comfort 
and towing capacity was superior to 
others.  Dealer discounted 
substantially with approx. 8k off of 
MSRP.  Much better value than 
overpriced alternatives with less 
options.  Good ride, lots of power, all 
amenities and options for same price as 
an LX Honda Pilot.  GM's low financing 
rate is less too. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Stacy, 06/11/2003,I Love it!,4,"I researched vehicles to purchase for 
more than a year and this is the only 
vehicle in the price range I was 
willing to spend that fully satisfied 
my luxury and people transportation 
needs and my husband's truck needs."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,tran, 07/29/2003,Not Bad...Actually Pretty Good!,4,"I like my first GM purchase.  The V-8 
has a lot of power. In comparison to 
all the SUVs out there within the 
price range, the Envoy beats them all 
in terms of price, features, power, 
and comfort.  The Envoy rides much 
smoother than the Expedition, Tahoe, 
or Sequoia."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,buffy_flyer, 08/15/2003,Suburban Replacement,4,"Best option for being able to tow but 
being smaller and more nimble.  So far 
very impressed with the 6 cylinder 
engine, both from a power standpoint 
and gas mileage.  Concerns about mushy 
handling have not been realized.  Wife 
likes it better than Suburban because 
it is easier to handle around town.  
Try it, you'll like it!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,V-MAN, 02/27/2003,WHAT A DRIVE,4,"This is my second GMC vehicle and I 
love it more than the last.This SUV 
rides like a car. Comfort is great.I 
love the I6 engine, plenty of power 
when you need it. So far it's been a 
blast to drive. I put about 25 to 30k 
miles a yr so comfort, power and 
reliability are very important to me 
and so far my Envoy XL has lived up to 
my expectations. Fuel ecomony so far is 
avg at best. Looking for mpg 
improvement as soon as the weather gets 
a bit nicer"
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,bikerscape, 08/31/2003,untweaked,4,"Outstanding SUV.  Suffered items that 
should not go past final assembly 
inspection/delivery.  Cmn A/C issue 
resolved after taking back, but well 
known about (fix it before it 
leaves !).  A couple minor build 
issues (Folks in OKC -- Wake UP !!!).  
After resolving minor issues it's been 
great.  Amazing the only car I never 
had any problem with was metric.  
Americans are doing great eng and 
design.  It's the execution that's the 
problem.  Assemble to 100 % - dealer 
run interference on minor issues 
before delivery.  Learn something in 
100 years !"
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Dave in CO, 09/05/2003,Great SUV...but it's not a minivan,4,"Just bought the Envoy XL SLE. I love 
it, but it's not a minivan. I bought 
it with the idea that my wife and 
three kids (2, 4, and 6)would use it. 
Great idea...it sits way up high, 
handles/rides superbly, nice quality 
(and I am leery of GM products) but 
the execution didn't pan out. The 
Envoy is too tall for her to get in
(solved: purchased running boards), 
doesn't have nearly the functionality 
(cubby holes, cup holders), and the 
tumbling seats are a nuisance to pile 
into/out of every time for my three 
little kids. Don't get me wrong, I 
like the XL...but it's not going to 
work out for the ""wife car"". "
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,ATLIAH, 09/06/2003,Alot better than the Explorer,4,"Purchased the Envoy after four bad 
years with 2 different Expl. XLTs. 
Interior is excellent especially the 
room for the third row. No major 
problems, 1 recall. Ride is very smooth

in the back for the kids is great."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,ff0101, 09/06/2003,Great SUV...but it's not a minivan,4,"Got the SLE XL in hopes of replacing 
my minivan. Not a good idea. Yeah, it 
sits 6 adults...but I've got three 
little kids. Tumbling the second row 
is a pain, especially with all the car 
seats. Not a good idea. Now, in a few 
years it'll be ideal. And I love to 
drive it myself. My first GM product 
in a while (I swore myself off years 
ago after getting burned) so I'm 
crossing my fingers and hoping for the 
best."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,emn, 07/20/2003,Regretting this purchase,3,"We purchased a new Envoy XL 11 months 
ago and have had it in the shop for 
repairs 8 times.  Although we love the 
comfortable ride and attractiveness of 
the vehicle, we have been sorely 
disappointed by its reliability.  The 
problems we have experienced include a 
cracked gas tank, failed 4WD, failed 
windshield wiper mechanism, failed seat

computer system glitches, as well as a 
couple of recall repairs.  "

suvs"" I was sold on the Envoy. The 
Acura MDX and Volvo were not true 7 
seaters. I was impressed with the ride 
and features available in the Envoy. I 
receive many compliments. I think the 
interior, as well as, the exterior is 
very attractive. The ride is quiet and 
smooth, and there is power when you 
want it. I am very satisfied with my 
decision.       "
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,ravengotu, 09/19/2003,Good vehicle but cheap interior,4,"While this review covers the VORTEC 
V-8 in my envoy, the inside materials

happy as i would have been and hope 
that GMC will change these in the

Expedition, Trailblazer, 4Runner, 
Pilot, Sequoia, Durango, Grand Cherokee 
and found the Envoy XL far superior in 
roominess, power, features, & style.  I 
wasn't even considering a GM product 
after past bad experience, but just had 
to try this one because of all of it's 
advantages over the competition. I have 
had mine for 3 months and have enjoyed 
every minute so far.  SLE version 
offered all the important options I was 
looking for (& then some) -- don't 
believe the SLT version offered much 
for the extra cost.  Good job GM!     "
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,John Davison, 10/25/2003,Best Vehicle I've ever owned,4,"The Envoy was portraied to me as a

gmc,envoy-xl,2003,judykgwtw, 11/29/2003,Terrific handling and design of features,4,"To this SUV is easy to get into and out 
of, low the ground.  Fun to drive and 
easy to park in any space.  It is 
smooth on the highway and handles 
great.  This is the first SUV I have 
driven and definetly will not be the 
last.  The reason for buying this one 
was the styling and the third row 
seat.  Then after test driving it, I 
was sold.  Knowing about the safety 
features, side air bags, etc. also 
helped make my decision.  I would 
recommend this SUV to everyone.  I'm 
only 5'2"" and it is very comfortable 
for me.  My father is 6' and there is 
plenty of shoulder and head room."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Textallguy, 05/28/2005,Great family car,4,"We ordered our Envoy from the factory with everything we wanted at the SLE trim level, and outside of a fairly early problem with the A/C (took four trips to the dealer to finally fix it), we have been very satisfied with our choice.  The zero % financing was a definite plus as well."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,soccermom1013, 12/29/2003,Loving it so far...,4,"As a mom with 3 kids under 6 years old, I 
needed something that could comfortably 
accomodate all of us and all our stuff.  I had 
grown tired of my mini-van and longed for 
something fun to drive.  After an accident in 
the mini-van, I was forced to rent a car while 
the van was in the shop.  I told the rental 
person I needed something with 3 rows.  Enter 
the Envoy...I had it for a week.  There's no 
better test than trying it for that long. We'd 
always driven foreign cars and really seriously 
thought about buying the Envoy since we 
really needed another car to fit our large 
family.  The financing deal was too good to 
pass up and so far, we are very happy."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Dennis DeFelice, 12/31/2003,Ideal Family SUV,5,"I drove every competitor and near 
competitor, and this was the most 
versatile SUV of all. Get ECAS for 
leveling the ride.  It delivers 
superior performance, comfort, 
driveability, and features. Better gas 
mileage with more horsepower and torque 
than most.  Comfortable and easy to 
drive while relatively quiet.  Load it 
with features and still pay less than 
many competitors and a total cost of 
ownership reviews less than any of its 
competitors."

have the older model,'92 GMC Jimmy SLE,
it was a little bumpy, but once we got
the new Model, we were hooked.  Ours is
a Pewter with the 3rd row.  I just
simply love it."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Jeff Davidson, 01/12/2004,Do your homework!,4,"I've had my Envoy XL for a bit over a 
month...however I do about 3,000 miles 
a month so I've had some time to get 
to know it.  This vehicle is extremely 
comfortable, especially for a person 
like me who does many highway miles.  
I like the interior features of the 
vehicle.  Everything is truly at your 
fingertips.  As I mentioned...I do a 
great deal of highway mileage so my 
average MPG is about 17.9, which is 
much better than other SUV's I've 
owned.  Oh, by the way...I have the 
V8.  My business partner bought one a 
week later with the V6 and is 
averaging worse mileage under the 
relatively same driving habits."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,MattATL, 01/13/2004,A excellent choice so far,4,"Its a comfortable people hauler. Have 
been on five trips and it rides very

are Lexus like. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Grego, 01/23/2004,Something For Everyone,4,"After selling the Plymouth Voyager mini-
van we were ready for a family vehicle 
that was fun to drive.  Our new Envoy 
XL is great for getting groceries, 
going hunting, and hauling around the 
kids plus friends.  I have long legs 
and my wife has short legs so the 
position memory for the seats is great. 
The great stereo, leather interior, 
rain sensing wipers, and onstar make it 
a great ride for a long road trip. We 
had some problems with the 
transmission, but GM has replaced it 
with a new one (after atempting a fix 
that didn't work)."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,BAA, 01/24/2004,Best Car I've ever owned!,4,"By far the best car/suv I've ever

Automatic four wheel drive is a joy 
during Michigan winter.  I test drove 
Fords, Toyota and Dodge.  Their not 
even close to the Envoy."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,J, Carucci,Happy with Envoy XL,3,After owning the Envoy XL for a little over 2 years I am happy with it. Except for the minor electrical problems with the memory switch and radio the truck suits our needs. Handling and power are fine and the room is more then enough for shopping trips. On long travel trips it is comfortible and easy to drive. Overall I am glad I got the Envoy XL instead of the competitors. Looking forward to trading up to the Denali Series.
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Trish, 12/13/2005,My Envoy Rocks!,4,Love this car! Have had SUV's for years and this is the best yet. Great for long trips (I don't fly); lots of room; heated seats are wonderful. 
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Rick in Colorado, 03/04/2003,"Great ride, terrible gas milage.",4,"I have had the Envoy XL for a month 
now. Looked at just about everything in 
it's class, but chose the Envoy after a 
test drive. What a ride!  It's as 
smooth and quite as anything we looked 
at. My only complaint is the absolute 
shock over the horrible gas milage. Our 
first tank was a trip to Denver and 
back. It barely got 17 mpg.  The most 
recent tank has been all city, 10.8 
mpg. The dealer tells me the oxygenated 
fuels we are forced to use in the 
winter really hit the gas milage.  But 
it hurt to fill up that tank at $1.80/ 
gal."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,BCB, 12/30/2005,Overpriced Junk/Always Broken,2,"After 30 months of ownership, the Envoy was in the shop a total of 99 days on 19 different visits.  All kinds of problems, front differential 4 times, AC 4 times, rear window/deflector 5 times, weatherstrip falling off, door panels separating, and much more.  Something was always broken on this truck.  Seats look good but aren't very comfortable, handling is poor, waddles down the road and leans badly in the corners, ride is mush.  Envoy does look good and I-6 delivers exceptional mileage and performance (18 city and 23-24 hiway with 3.47 differential).  Bought because it really fit my needs for space and seats, easy third row access and space, but always a problem needing repair."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,frania23, 04/04/2004,envoy fan,3,"This truck is great for an active 
family.  It is great for carpooling and 
the 6 cylinder helps with gas 
consumption.  I have had a problem with 
the radio where it had to be replaced.  
Also, I hear some rattling from the 
rear.  Overall, I would purchase this 
truck again because it fulfills our 
family needs by being a 6 cylinder, 
American company and good 
passenger/cargo space."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Dona, 07/10/2006,No problems here,2,"Needed the cargo space for wheelchair to haul elderly parent around town, & on trips. It suits my needs nicely. It's such an easy drive & smooth ride for passengers. "

Fit and trim pretty good.Overall vision is OK, hard to totally elimitate some peripheral blind spots.

What a great vehicle & joy to drive. My 
search compared the Honda Pilot, Tahoe,

experienced in an SUV (of the ones I 
could afford.)   The suspension is 
incredibly smooth for such a powerful 
engine.    This SUV has many luxury 
features without having to pay the 
luxury price.   The front has great 
passenger head room and leg room easily 
allows for a 6'2"" passenger to stretch 
out.   However, the leg room in the 
second row seems a little tight.  The 
only drawback is the gas mileage.   I 
feel like I am always putting gas in 
this vehicle.  All in all, this is an 
exceptional vehicle that gives this 
family man a little ego boost when 
driving and provides good features for 
the family to enjoy the ride."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Skicar, 04/01/2003,Skicar,4,"Very smooth ride.  The V-8 has amazing 
power which I highly recommended.  The 
XL also has the capacity of a full-
size truck (Expedition & Tahoe) but in 
a mid-size SUV.  The width of the XL 
fits perfectly in my garage compared 
to the full size trucks that are 3-5""

It had computer problems at 50,000 miles and it took three different dealers to find the problem. No issues since then.  ery high level of features for the price. Very few compromises required.  I moved from an Explorer to this GMC and it was like going from a Ford to a Cadillac in comfort, ride, and features. Handling is not that great, but on the highway it is limosine comfortable.   The engine is adequate and the mileage with the original tires averaged 20 mpg.  (Stick with the Michelins). I expect to put 300,000 miles on this Envoy."

experience.  Only time will tell if it 
performs, mechnically as well as the 
Explorer, but it can't be touch when it 
comes to handling, acceleration, 
cornering, road noise, and most of all 
comfort and convenience.  This vehicle 
is professional grade!!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Andy C, 02/05/2003,I Like It So Far,5,"I have only had my Envoy XL SLT for 
only a week but it is a great vehicle 
so far.This is my 3rd SUV and bye far 
this is my favorite so far. I have had 
a 1999 Durango loaded and a 1996 Nssan 
Pathfinder and this beats them both 
hands down. The Envoy rides much 
smoother than either one of them and 
is very much quieter than the other 
ones. Well we will see if the gas 
milage will be what they say it will 
be. Very impressed with the 6 cylnder 
with 275 horsepower. My Dodge was a V8 
360 and only had 245 horsepower and 
averaged 16 miles on highway and 12 in 
town. Well this is my first GMC and 
hope it will be a great experience for 
my family."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,jolat, 03/12/2003,Best Mid-size SUV on the road,5,"I bought an Envoy for my wife last 
august. Best auto purchase we've ever 
made!!  Runs good, plenty of power, 
super comfortable, total and complete 
satisfaction.  Highly recommended!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,silvergt02, 05/21/2003,Great Truck,4,"After looking at the full size trucks 
(Suburban,Tahoe,Yukon)I decided that 
the Envoy was the truck.  We have had 
it for 4 months now and are very 
happy.  This truck rides so smooth.  
Its like riding in a town car.  I opted 
for the V8.  There is no shortage of 
power.  I loaded mine up with about 
every option and walked away with the 
truck for 38,000...Better than 50,000 
for a Denali.  The rear seats are more 
comfortable and have more leg room that 
the other full sized trucks.  The 
interior is nice than its sisters
(Chevy) I own a 2002 Mustang vert and a 
2001 Dakota pick up and I always find 
myself driving this truck over the 
other 2."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,BillT, 06/05/2003,2003 Envoy XL,4,"Engine is torqey & powerful. Even with 
the standard Bilstein shocks, I feel
the ride is a bit unbalanced. Feels a 
little harsh over sharp bumps, yet 
truck has more than its share of body 
roll and unresponsive steering. Brakes 
are excellent, interior comfort is 
excellent. Seats need way more side 
bolstering. Lots of interior room and 
nice sounding sound system (even the 
base unit). Overall a very nice truck, 
though I think for $40,000 there are 
other choices available. I needed the 
towing capacity the Envoy has. "

plastic.  Engineered poorly.  wind

pulled hinges up. back window moves 
making it difficult to close.  Rear 
door difficult to close.  I made a

this model.  I am sure they will work 
out problems on the next years model."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,ehunteriv, 06/17/2003,Very nice vehicle,4,"Owned now for almost 1 year, everything 
is GREAT except:  One recurring problem 
is with the automated sideview 
mirrors.  They have replaced the part 
that is supposed to provide a curbview 
when you put the SUV in reverse.  Also 
had a problem with my dashboard 
lighting going out which turned out to 
be a 3 day problem to fix.  Also had a 
problem where in the mornings, I would 
step on the gas peddle, the SUV would 
rev up very very loud, but the tach may 
only show perhaps 2500rpm's, and the 
Envoy would barely move, then it would 
just go away.  They did a fix, and 
haven't had the problem since. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Swede, 06/17/2003,I got what I expected,4,"I love my Envoy XL.  I have the inline 
6 cylinder and it has plenty of power 
pulling an 18 ft. fishing boat fully 
loaded.  The mileage is better than I 
expected, I am getting about 20 mpg. 
The AWD function performed great last 
winter on the ice and snow.  I have 
yet to engage 4wd to pull the boat up 
the ramp."
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,weldonm, 06/22/2003,A year of +'s and -'s,3,"Good ride, a fair amount of bells and 
whistles, but with that comes the 
inevitable price.  Overall, I like the 
Envoy, but there are a few things I 
would change. I would not get the moon 
roof as it restricts head room for me 
(6-1) and the leg room is a bit cramped 
for the driver.  My mirrors get lost 
and look up from time to time and we do 
have some squeaks developing at 30k 
miles. I will not be a repeat buyer, 
simply because it isn't all that 
comfortable for me on long trips."

gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Robert Wayne Miller, 01/01/2019,2003 GMC Envoy XL V-8 engine super suv,3,"Replaced a computer twice under within first month of ownership that was covered under warranty.  Toured Alaska for 2 months driving over 10,000 trouble free miles while pulling a 22 foot camping trailer.  I installed a transmission cooler just for this trip.  I always used Mobile One Synthetic oil and changed the oil every 2000 miles. At around 60,000 miles catalytic converter went bad.  At about 90,000 miles stereo stopped working. I did not repair.  Head light relay had to be replaced at 101,000 miles. At 102,000 miles I hit a large buck whitetail deer doing extensive damage to grill, radiator, power steering pump and probably more as vehicle is in garage for repair.  I was extremely pleased the way this vehicle handled this collision.  Remained stable and handled great. 104,000 miles the gear shift cable broke and I could not shift out of park.  Triple A sent a wrecker to take my vehicle to my dealer.  The repair cost about $250.00.   I will trade this vehicle for a 2020 Subaru Outback.  My Envoy is just too unreliable.
"
gmc,envoy-xl,2003,Crystal, 05/05/2020,Money Pit,3,"I should start by saying this is like a relationship with a man who you love with all your heart, but he is financially abusive. I am SO in love with my XL. I have 5 kids. There is plenty of room and came at a much lower used price point than a suburban or Yukon XL. It is SOOO comfortable and rides like a dream. It has every feature anyone could ever want, and my hubs who would normally want to put $1000 worth of speakers into any new ride we get, gave the thumbs up on the factory Bose. with the 5.3L, I can't whine about the gas mileage, but we have gotten upwards of 21mpg on road trips which is above the published 18 mpgs to expect on highway. Despite the disappointing ground clearance, it also does really well off road and the 4 wheel drive has helped me climb out of some precarious places I probably shouldn't have gone into. 

Now for the ""not happy"" stuff that goes on behind the scenes.  

My Envoy XL sprang a leak around 95,000 miles.  The entire engine is leaking - from everywhere. Over $5000 in various repairs to fix the 5 sources of the leak, and for that cost I could have put in a brand new engine. 

My only other pet peeve is the lack of cabin filter. The Trailblazers have them, why not these? We do a significant amount of offroad travel and can't have the A/C on or dust gets blown into the interior. Makes for some unpleasant trips where we have to choose between choking on dust while staying cool or cooking with the windows open and still eating dust. 
"
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Matt, 09/20/2015,"A great vehicle, when it's not falling apart...",3,"There are some things that I really appreciate about this vehicle and others that are extremely frustrating/disappointing. 
After the warranty was up it's been problem after problem with many parts of the vehicle. Dash/gauge failure, HVAC failure front and rear, the air suspension in the rear has failed multiple times, rack/pinion broke, power steering cooler rusted out, passenger interior door panel has come off twice, the CD player has jammed,  exterior paneling on the back hatch broken. 
However, the engine has always performed beautifully for me. There's a lot of power to it and plenty of ""oomph"" to it. It cruises very comfortably, shifts smoothly and handles well. It's heavier weight (7-passenger trim), low center of gravity and 4WD make it extremely adept at getting around on snowy roads, which has been a huge positive as I live in an area with a lot of lake-effect snow every winter. It's reliably started easy 100% of the time as a daily driver. No repairs needed on the engine/transmission itself, only steering. 
It's tough to hate on a vehicle that has been quite reliable in it's essential components and getting where you need to go but all the ""comfort"" aspects of the vehicle seem to be extremely cheap. 
Probably not a lot of resale value on it for this reason, but if you can snag one for a few grand it's definitely a good vehicle for a teen or an everyday get from point A to point B in wintery conditions.
"
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,chilldick, 03/12/2015,Money pit,3,"Bought this one brand new back in 2004. Cost me $35,000 and now I'm lucky if I get 2 grand for it. 800$ for rear ac repair. I need another door switch and will be another 250+ and also it needs to be programmed! So that's another 50$. Oil gauge is out of whack. Replaced motor mounts thermostat alternator and other things I can't recall at the moment but paid about 1300$. The latch to the glove compartment fell off, and now I need another engine! 
(I'm pissed!) got no choice but to buy it. I have to much invested in it. And I'm sure after that the freaking transmission will go out on it. I don't recommend this suv. Very poorly made. Engine has only 150k. To soon for new engine! "
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,DJ, 05/22/2007,Envoy XL Review,4,"I love driving my Envoy XL. It handles easily and even with the base 6 cylinder engine has more then enough horsepower for driving around the city. It has performed extremely well in trips to the coast and through the mountains. The only complaint so far has to be a terrible odor that comes from the air vents. It is extremely noticable in the summer time, and seems to be caused by mold build-up. My GM dealer has cleaned it out several times, but hasn't found the cure for it yet. Otherwise a strong and family- friendly vehicle with enough room in the 3rd row seats for my 2 boys to stretch out in and actually be comfortable."

I love the ride on long trips.  It's not a Porsche, it's an SUV, so it will be a tad numb in the steering.   I've just hit 60K miles, 5 years later & the transmission is slipping........  Neighbor had her 2005 Envoy tranny go @ only 38K miles.  WHY can't the American car builders make a reliable transmission???  Past Chevy's I've owned at least waited til 100K miles til the tranny died.  Nissans, Hondas, all go 200K without hiccups.  I'll fix the GMC & keep it another few years but will look to the Japanese or German for my next vehicle.  "

It seems that the car ran pretty well until the warranty ran out and then the flood gates opened on a myriad of problems. I've never missed and oil change and the car has been serviced properly. Yet, I have already spent 2000 to replace the lifters in the engine. The oil pressure sensor has broken twice and is broken now. I'm also having to deal with a broken gas gage for the second time.
Shocks have been replaced. Stabiltrack has never worked right. And now my mechanic says my engine is skipping and will need replacing because apparently there have been alot of problems with the GM V-8 engines. "

gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Bill Kulling, 10/17/2008,My 2004 Envoy,4,A very comfortable highway cruiser. Great family auto. Shifting is seamless and quiet and the ride is excellent. The fuel economy is a detractor but since it is not the daily driver this is not an issue. The 3rd row seating is roomy enough for full size adults. Many thoughtful amenities throughout car. If you can afford to fill it I highly recomend it.
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Starino, 09/02/2003,Outstanding,4,"Overall it is a great SUV!!  Here are 
my few +'s and negatives:

+
1.)  It is powerful!  Get the V8 if you 
cna live with the 1 mpg gas hit.  It 
gives the truck that extra bit of power 
it needs for ANY stituation.
2.)  Smooth car like ride!

-
1.)  Leater seats are cloth on the 
sides of the vechicle to save money.
2.)  Leather on the seats don't seem as 
durable as past GMC prodcuts I have 
owned.
3.)  One display!  With all the info 
they give you on the car tehy should 
give yoau larger display area
4.)  For the price range a GPS mappign 
system should be available!
5.)  Cruise control shoudl be on the 
wheel not on the steering column."

underpowered, cheap interior), and 
finally test drove the Envoy with the 
4.2, strong motor, smooth ride (not on 
twists, but hey, it's a truck!). We 
were very impressed by the total 
package."
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,bluez, 03/18/2004,Luv my Envoy,4,"I love the power, color , stereo 
system, heated mirrors and seats.  Well 
I like everything about my Envoy. I 
love being spoiled by the immense 
features. Ford can not compare to the 
Envoy neither can the Honda Pilot. I 
have test drove both.  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,dzheng, 03/25/2004,A solid performer,4,"After drove the Envoy XL, I could not 
understand why Consumer Reports gave a 
low rating for this vehicle. It has 
lots of seat and cargo space, a 
powerful engine, good exterior styling, 
and a very smooth ride. I noticed the 
the structure is very solid, and found 
no resonance as I go through potholes. 
(This car was GM company owned vehicle 
which had already been driven for 8600 
miles on the mine-field-like Detroit 
roads)"
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,djuergens, 03/29/2004,American Engineering at it's Best,4,"Seating comfort quality is as good as 
they come and ride comfort is 
absolutely amazing.  Rides and handles 
like a big heavy car.  Honda engineers 
should drive one of these.  They have 
the real luxury feal and large 
wheelbase.  Can't imagine why Honda 
Pilot is in this ""compare to"" 
category.  Just because it's a SUV 
dosent mean you have to feel the 
pavement and every little crack."

SPEED PICK-UP IS EXCELLENT.  THE 
SUSPENSION IS REAL GOOD.  IT DRIVES 
SMOOTH JUST LIKE A CAR.  THE STYLE OF 
THE CAR IS BEAUTIFUL.  AS I DRIVE BY, 
HEADS TURN EVERYWHERE NOTICING MY 
ENVOY.  THE CAR PERFORMANCE IS 
EXCELLENT."

met or exceeded all my expectations.  
It performs well when towing a covered 
trailer plus two ATV's.  Mileage 
suffers of course when towing.  
Averages 17 miles p.g. otherwise.  Has 
air lift suspension. Very comfortable

with four sets of golf clubs not 
stacked all over each other."

gmc,envoy-xl,2004,derrihar, 05/13/2004,Fist Time GM buyer,4,"I went to look for a Honda Pilot.  
After test driving both, the Envoy 
blew it away.  The smooth ride and 
comfort were far superior than the 
Pilot.  There is real room for 7 with 
the 3rd row seat, and when it is not 
being used, the Envoy provides tons of 
cargo room.  I am also impressed with 
the inline 6 cyl Vortec engine that 
comes with the Envoy.  Plenty of power 
and acceleration.  "

perfectly, heats and cools without

looked at Pilot, Trailblazer, Yukon, 
Explorer, Durango and 4Runner. This 
vehicle tops all the others. It run 
perfectly and while being an american

gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Chris Cheek, 08/29/2004,Envoy Experience,4,"The Envoy XL is an outstanding luxury 
SUV with lots of room for full grown 
children (6' plus) and adults. 
The ride is outstanding and better than 
any luxury car (mercedes, cadillac, 
buick). Love the moonroof feature with 
the tinted glass and being able to open 
up.  Superb handling in a SUV. Have had 
a great experience with the car, but... 
have had a ""Service Engine Soon"" 
light.  The dealership has worked on it 
4 times and it keeps appearing, but the 
SUV has not shown ANY degradation in 
performance and handling.  GM has said 
this is one of only four to have this 
problem.  Other than the light, I have 
loved driving it, and plan to continue 
to or have another."
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,sdr728, 09/13/2004,Luxury at a great price,5,"My wife and I were looking for a big 
vehicle for all of our hauling and the 
two children and their friends. We had 
the opportunity to drive the Envoy and 
fell in love. We were a little 
concerned with the Six Cyl 4.2 Engine 
but WOW are we impressed now. We have 
never felt like more power was needed 
and the fuel economy is outstanding!!
I have friends that have driven these 
veh's hard and the mileage is in line 
with the V8 models but I drive very 
conservativiely and love the ride. You 
drive this truck like you should with 
precious cargo on board and you will 
love the ride, power and MPG!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,DKAWAY, 09/14/2004,Family Cruiser,5,"Terrific for trips with children given

gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Elizabeth Drew, 09/14/2004,Great Envoy,4,"I was concerned the Envoy XL would be 
too large for me, but it handles so 
well, it was as comfortable as my old 
car. The feeling of safety and security 
is great. I feel very secure driving my 
Envoy because I can see traffic so 
well. GMC did a great job on the 
interior - very luxurious! "

well - have not had any problems with 
it."
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,dariet, 10/03/2004,Fun Ride,4,"Just an overall joy to drive and be a

one or two........."
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Chuck Spieser, 10/06/2004,Swiss Army Knife of SUVs,4,"Super truck that gets it done for the 
whole family.  Storage and 
functionality is fantastic.  The truck 
also looks great even though there are 
many of them on the road.  
Personalization is also key with grill

I am very happy with the Envoy."

gmc,envoy-xl,2004,techieguy, 12/07/2004,Great SUV,4,"Wonderful vehicle.  Ride is top 
notch.  Had a Honda Pilot for a while

Honda and the Envoy.

Build quality is every bit as good as 
the Honda and it is much more

adults in the truck and take a long 
trip!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,by momy247, 03/07/2005,Awesome Envoy!,5,"I traded in an 01 Toyota Sienna for this Envoy because I got tired of the mommy van.  I looked at the Honda Pilot first and thought I was ready to buy, then I looked at the Envoy XL, and there was no comparison.  The vehicle is very comfortable and the interior is very inviting. The Pilot interior seemed smaller and not comfortable at all.  There are also better rebates when you buy domestic! Foreign cars do not offer these great rebates! I saved a lot of money and it was well worth it! This seats 7 people very easily. I have even sat in the 3rd row myself on a long drive and there is plenty of legroom for adults. I had a DVD system put in for the kids and its perfect! I love this vehicle!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Gene, 03/19/2005,American Made,4,"Great American made SUV. it rides like a Caddy. Bose sound system, leather heated seats and sunroof are 5 Stars. Gas mileage is a let down and I believe people need to get loud on this subject. Take care of your customers and they will come back for more.  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Mrs.Green, 01/28/2006,My Envoy,4,My husband bought my 2004 GMC Envoy XL from a Chevrolet Dealer but it was a tester from GM. This meant I had every option on my Envoy. Although at the end of this year I will probably trade-in I might get another Envoy XL. I also like the 7 seats for when I'm hauling my grandkids. 
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Josh, 03/30/2006,Problems,3,We have had our Envoy for 2 years and we have had the ignition switch go out about 3 times an the front and rear air conditioning quit working about 2 times.
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,NPR_Florida, 09/19/2006,The first/last GM vehicle I will own,2,"This vehicle has some great features.  I really like it.  However, it has had some huge electronic issues such as the fuse module welding itself to the brain of the vehicle (almost a fire hazard), constant AC problems in both the forward and rear modules, and many other problems. Should have gone with Europe/Japan, will know next time."
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Anita Green, 07/12/2007,A GMC Lover,4,My husband bought me my Envoy XL as a GM demo. I love my Envoy XL. I have every option available and have had limited problems. I also like having seven seats to haul my grandkids around. Everything about my Envoy says luxury automobile.
gmc,envoy-xl,2004,Alan & Pam, 03/21/2008,Love the car. We hate to see it go,4,"We've had our Envoy XL SLT for 3 1/2 yrs and we are trading it off today. We love this car, and it is so comfortable and roomy, but I have been out of work now for a couple of years with health issues, and we cannot afford the high payments any longer. We were on the top when we bought it, but not any more. We held out as long as we could. Also, with the gas price craziness, we cannot afford the 16 mpg. I will be so sad when we drive off the lot and leave it there, but I will be so happy to have lower payments. My grandchildren loves this car too! To all of you that can continue to drive your Envoy XL SLT, we are happy for you. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Beth Mc, 05/04/2010,Love my Envoy,4,Bought my Envoy brand new in 2005.  Was my first car that had EVERYTHING I wanted on it.  Absolutely love sunroof and satellite radio.  Car has been very dependable.  I've only had to replace belt and do routine maintenance.  Very comfortable inside - especially on a 13 hr ride on vacation!  Would definitely recommend this car!  Lots of room for luggage and carrying capacity.
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Jo B. Gurganus, 05/27/2005,Loving my XL,5,"I had my Envoy XL for four days when a drunk lady rear-ended me. I was stopped at a red light. She hit me going about 35mph. My baby boy was in the back seat. The seatbelt his carseat was in stayed tight. We were both safe. And like the lady on the freeway I only needed a new rear bumper. Although greatful for the safety of my son and myself, my feelings were sure hurt. Thank you GMC for your safe cars. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,J. Stark, 03/18/2006,2005 Envoy XL,4,No major problems w/ vehicle.  Only service work done to date was to replace the original radio in dash.  
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,JJS, 10/07/2006,2005 Envoy,4,Really good experience overall.  Only trouble was satellite radio system. We had to change it out under warranty at dealership.  No other problems encountered.  
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,ben kinsman, 09/23/2005,2005 Envoy XL 3rd row,4,"The in-line 6 cylinder has good pickup with its 275 horsepower. We went on a trip the week we bought our Envoy, so I filled the 25 gal. tank and hit the road. To be as big as the XL model is, it did great on gas. We drove from Columbus GA. to Chattanooga Tenn. and back to Atlanta before we had to get gas. That's about 450 miles or more driving on the highway and around downtown in traffic. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,envoy05, 02/07/2012,2005 Envoy XL,2,"Here is something funny! I have a problem with the fuel sending unit.
I get it fixed under warranty.
I have another problem with fuel sending unit. (Funny right)
I have to fix it by myself because it is out of warranty.
I have a third problem with fuel sending unit.(Not Funny)
I call GM and complain.
I write numerous emails. Nothing.
I call the dealer to get an answer. Nothing again!
They go out of business because of GM closing down dealers.(Great)
I get a letter in the mail from another dealership saying they know there is a serious problem with the fuel sending unit and they are willing to pay for half, yes half of their crap sending units!
Toyota or Nissan here I come!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,D. E. Nali, 08/06/2005,"Worth the Test Drive, Worth the Purchase",5,This vehichle is by far the best mid- size SUV I have driven.  The XL version has more cargo room than the Chevy Tahoe and gets great gas mileage (compared to others).  The Denali trim is aesthetically pleasing and detailed and provides one of the smoothest rides you will experience.  The optional sunroof will take the place of the rear seat DVD entertainment system but provides a fun-in-the-sun experience without the hurricane wind affect you will find in other vehicles.  Highway fuel economy averages between 19-20 mpg with an empty load and 18-19 mpg fully loaded.  At one point I was messing around with the Average Fuel Economy button and I was getting around 25 mpg at 45-50 mph!
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Skiwhack, 11/14/2005,Highway MPG not as promised,3,"I traded in my 2001 Isusu Trooper anniversary edition for the Envoy XL for the 3rd row and better highway mileage est. of 18 mpg., o4 better than I was getting with the trooper. I drive consistent hwy speeds for 39 miles each way and only maxed out at 14.2 mpg.  Anybody else experiencing the same thing?  I'm considering having the dealer look at this because that is the claim for city mileage not highway and will trade in the lease for something with better fuel efficiency.  "

Have owned dozens of vehicles in my lifetime.  I wouldn't sell this POS to my worst enemy.  Update:  I own 2 Jaguars which COMBINED have cost me less $$.  I have sunk over $20K plus in repairs.  Constantly in the shop.  Silver lining . . . last repair would have been $3K . . . sold it for scrap for $300 . . . best financial decision I ever made!!

gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Sandra, 08/13/2005,My First Experience,4,"Amazing car for the price. Lot of amenities. I was blown away by the interior design. I was looking for your typical color (grey), not so!

gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Rick, 11/07/2005,Great on Long Trips,4,"We recently drove from CT to FL & back. A very good experience. Seats never got uncomfortable & multiple adjustments & heating are great.  The ride was pretty smooth & quiet. Very easy to drive for long periods.  You feel some vibrations/bumps, but this is a truck and not a true luxury car. We wanted the extra cargo space of the XL vs. the extra seating, but it is nice to know it is there. We actually think there is more leg room in the 3rd row than the 2nd. Plenty of gadgets to keep everyone busy (rear DVD especially). We averaged about 20MPG (up to 22MG at slower speeds) even when fully loaded & going 70-75 MPH. Has the cargo & people space of a large SUV in a manageable mid-size package."

great.  The ride of the compares with 
those I have done in luxury sedans. 
The Bose sound system, satelite radio, 
and moonroof are GREAT options that I 
enjoy.  The rear seat can hold a 
person six feet plus without touching 
the ceiling. The fuel economy actually 
gets better as the engine is broke in,

gmc,envoy-xl,2005,jjones64, 06/05/2005,GM has some catching up to do,3,"Overall, this vehicle is nice, but when compared to Nissan and Toyota build quality, styling, and engineering, the Japanese vehicles win hands down - without question. I bought the Envoy because GM is making serious deals on them right now. It was the right financial move, but not my first choice in vehicles. The Nissan Pathfinder is most definitely the better vehicle, albeit smaller"
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Maria, 06/07/2005,Love my Envoy XL,4,"I have had my car less than a year.  I have had two problems:  first-the fuel pump had to be replaced.

Most leg room in the third row seating of any competitor in its class.  My first SUV and I'm satisfied.  Looked at the Pathfinder, Explorer, Murano, Pilot, and 4-Runner.  Couldn't beat the features and roominess of the Envoy for the price they were offering.  If they didn't have the employee pricing, I would have gone for the Pathfinder. Still, the Pathfinder does not have as much third seat leg room.  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Bob Anger, 02/24/2017,Great 2nd,4,"Poor MPG (17.5) , but it is a V8 and will fly when needed to go around another.

I did have to replace the battery in the key fob, it only lasted 13 years

As far as I can determine after driving and close inspection I feel that the Envoy compare very well with any vehicle of Japanese manufacture.  As a registered Quality Engineer, I feel that that in the Envoy the American manufacturer has met and exceeded the quality from Japan. I feel that anyone purchaceing the Envoy will be completely satisfied with the quality and workmanship on the GMC Envoy."
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Herbie, 10/09/2004,Buy your own Envoy,4,"The Envoy was the most expensive 
vehicle I ever bought and I would buy 
another if I had the need. I am asked 
questions about it almost everywhere I 
go and I tell everyone, with this truck 
you have alot of space, power, what I 
think is good fuel milage (20 Highway), 
quiet ride, the turning radius of a 
small car, and will pull a trailer like 
its not even behind you. Visibility is 
great, and I feel good knowing that my 
wife and 3 children are riding in this. 
So to sum up what I think of this 
automobile, I say ""buy your own and you 
wont regret it""."

become my absolute favorite to drive.  
It is stylish, elegant almost, has 
beautiful lines and the interior is 
nicer than my sister's BMW X5; in fact, 
it rides better than her BMW X5!  There 
is plenty of room for the kids and for 
carpooling to and from school and 
hockey practice.  The DVD player is a 
godsend and the fact that it comes with 
OnStar® and XM Satellite Radio® pushes 
it way ahead of the so called

gmc,envoy-xl,2005,GLH, 01/03/2005,Love my Envoy,4,"This rating is actually on an '03 Envoy 
XL-SLT V8, purchased 12/2003. The only 
real complaint I have about this SUV is 
the handling, and although it's good 
for a large vehicle, the Tahoe & 
Suburban are still better (even though 
larger).  Hopefully in time the Envoy 
will get more attenion in this area, 
but overall for an American SUV I'm 
very pleased, and I chose this over my 
BMW 528 which I sold.  I would 
recommend this or the Trailblazer over 
an Explorer or Expedition anyday, the 
Envoy is very capable."
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,DebMcDon, 04/27/2005,Love My Envoy,4,Historically GM products in my family have been the most reliable product we have every purchased.  We have taken my Envoy on 3 long road trips and we were very comfortable.  I also pulled a boat with it and had no problems with accelleration uphill.  I beleive this is the best vehicle I have ever owned.
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,Aspete, 07/14/2005,Not to Shabby!,4,"We've had our Envoy for about a couple of months now and have gone on 3 long road trips in it. It runs like a champ.  Even with the V6, it has well enough power to get going. Nice, quiet ride along the highway. I don't know about the other models, but on my XL, to me it's difficult to determine where the rear is when backing up. It is kinda hard to see the blind spot and the rear, but then again, I did drive a smaller car before. The gas mileage just plain stinks, and averages 14 city and 20 highway, but what SUV gas mileage doesn't? "
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,R. Rich, 08/04/2005,2 Envoy XL's!,4,"I actually leased a fully loaded Envoy XL in Jan. 05 and the Denali version in June 05, so my wife has one and I have one! I gave up a Jag XJ for an XL because I needed the 3 rows of seats.  It was the only SUV that had the ""ride"" I wanted. Both have the V8. Except for some minor trim changes both are identical. The Denali version does have an ""obvious"" quiet package.  They are good strong vehicles and the quality appears to be very good. I am obviously happy since I've got 2! "
gmc,envoy-xl,2005,W, 09/21/2005,Love my new Envoy XL!,4,We traded in my Lexus GX 470 since we car pool a lot and frankly needed more room.  I was worried that it wouldn't handle as well as my previous SUV.  It's a gem.  It rides so smooth and the interior is extremely comfortable.
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,gm_dave, 02/10/2013,Used Envoy XL Denali,4,"We purchased ours 3 years ago so it was 4 years old when we got it.
It was GM certified and one owner with about 45,000 miles.
We've put on about 40,000 miles.
it has been mostly trouble free except for the rear air suspension failed early on.
This was covered under the GM Certified warranty so that was a relief.


Performance and power is decent with the standard 5.3L V-8.
One other problem was excess oil consumption, which was due to a faulty valve cover design.
This was replaced at our expense by the local GM dealer."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,lemonsuv, 12/18/2012,How sad :(,2,"I cringe when I learn friends have purchased a used GMC Envoy.
I feel like I should just 'scream' to let them know how much money they will be spending for stupidness.

The first brand new vechile I ever purchased.
I can't begin to tell you the amount of money I have spent on it.
A lemon it is.
Stupid things go wrong that should not go wrong.
Stablity track 6 times needs to be fixed.
Window motor...3x's
Now the ignition switch went...my fuse box gets so hot my kid in the back can smell it. Light bulbs blow every 2 months.
Oil gauge went, fuel gauge went.
All and all, I spent over 6,000 in repairs since I bought it.


Does GMC care?
I highly doubt it.
Would I purchse another...NOPE!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,LovemyDenali, 06/17/2010,LoveMyDenali,4,"I have own this vehicle since new since the end of 2005 and it has been great.  I have never had a problem, it drives and handles well.  It is a Denali, so is loaded and very comfortable with leather interior and power and heated seats.  It does not have the best mileage but for the size I think it does pretty well.  On the highway handles well and give a lot better mileage at 22 mpg.  I have no complaints but just praise about the vehicle and is a keeper in my book. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,macattack, 02/10/2017,Don't BUY,2,"The vehicle will abruptly go from 70 mph to 30's (semi-trailer closing in fast) and I can't do a thing about it!! SERVICE STABILITRACK has been a thorn while under warranty and persists to be a problem now that it is out of warranty! From early on, <10,000 miles and OVER 10 times since, this vehicle had been in to two different dealers and the problem, though intermittent, still exists and is a HUGE danger to me and my kids but I can't just go buy another car or trade this is like some people (including the car dealership managers) portray is the best option when I should be able to get GM to fix the car or replace it when they can't seem to figure out why the problem persists. But that hasn't been the only problem:Gear band broke twice on the transmission, had to have Transmission rebuilt because of faulty radiator, and other issues however none of the problems remotely compare to having taken it in for service because of the repeated unexplained de-acceleration and loss of ability to make the car do anything except pull to the side of the road and give it ten minutes to stop having a ""tantrum"" of sorts while traffic whizzes by and thankfully didn't hit us (YET).  Exterior / Aesthetics, I love this vehicle but poor function and even worse service of problems. I've reported it to corporate but they don't care and despite it having had been into the dealership numerous times prior to end of warranty, now they just want me to start paying them for all these fixes that haven't fixed anything."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,envoyshow, 03/28/2011,Best SUV I have ever owned,4,"This is my 5th SUV and by far this one has been the best. I have owned a few Jeeps, a Pacifica, and most recently an Acura MDX and this one by far has been the best one. The ride has been much better than all of them, the interior design has been the best as well. It is bigger than all of them but not too big. Lot's of cargo space when 3rd row is up. Mecahnically the MDX was by far the worst with the 4X4 going out and the transmission. The Envoy mechanically has been great. The only issue we have had with it is one of the power windows but that was covered by the extended warranty we bought from National Vehicle Headquarters. We think we will keep this to 150,000 miles at least!!!!!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Ecobuilder, 07/11/2007,Best SUV I could find!!,4,"Powerful engine and love the DOD. Seamless! Excellent nav/stereo system except I wish it could play MP3's. Very comfortable in all rows, especially the 3rd row, my favourite seat. Rides and handles awesome for a vehicle its size. Tows effortlessly. Quiet in city or highway driving. Appreciate the side curtain airbags for my little girl. Best vehicle I've owned. Had some quirks in the beginning (engine ended up being replaced) but excellent since. Too bad it's not around after '07 although the Acadia is somewhat similiar."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,RT-OH, 09/30/2008,Overall - Good SUV,4,"I have enjoyed my 2nd Envoy for the last 2 years. It has a nice ride, enough power and the XL fits my kids comfortably while still allowing enough room behind the third row for golf clubs, groceries, etc. I wish this model had an adapter for ipod, but had to get aftermarket parts. The cup holder placement was not well though of with the front one being very awkward. Also, could have at least one more in front. The removeable, adjustable shelf in the rear is a nice feature. Might have a bit too much wind noise on highway speeds for me."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Second driver, 07/25/2006,Excellent Value,4,"This is a great vehicle. We chose because we wanted great 3rd row comfort, storage behind the 3rd row and a good number of safety features. The Envoy XL has about the best 3rd seating out there. We like the dash layout better than the Chevy. The ride is very good for a truck base SUV. Cornering gives a good lean, but is OK. Gas mileage has been right on target. I'd still take better. We have enjoyed the XL very much and have no regrets in buying. The SLT2 trim is a nice trim level. All the creature comforts and still not ""too"" pricey. I could not find a good enough reason to buy a Denali trim. The insurance for the '06 XL is cheaper than our '03 VW Passat! I will recommend to anyone without hesitation"
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,J. Hicks, 01/12/2006,The mini Suburban,4,This vehicle is a great value for the money if you need to haul a large family and still have some decent cargo room.  Very smooth capable powertrain and excellent ride and comfort.  This is the best value out there for a large family that needs a vehicle that can still have reasonable towing capability.
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Kjeter, 08/10/2010,Bordering on Lemon,3,"Within two weeks of buying, the vehicle was backfiring on engine start up.  Electronic control module had to be replaced.  At same time, engine was producing blue smoke on start up...entire engine had to be replaced. Since then, load balancers went out of whack and had to be fixed, ECM had to be replaced again, Heat and cooling module had to be replaced, signal light indicator in display panel has failed, rear hatch lock assembly had to be repaired, and now I'm dealing with engine ticking and loss of power that service bulletin is attributing to a lifter problem.  Seems like this latter problem should be a GMC recall vice just service bulletin notice."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,farmer72, 03/17/2009,Long Term SUV,4,"The car is a joy to drive.  Reliability is outstanding, handling is good, and mileage is good for a large V-8.  My family likes the features that set it apart from other similar vehicles.  On the road, it is a great vehicle that is comfortable on very long hauls."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Tish, 05/13/2009,Good SUV with minor problems,4,"I bought my truck in the summer it was a nice vehicle the was very smooth.  First my rear wiper motor went out then a month later my Body Control Module starts acting up along with my six-disc changer not working.(ABC Computer)This parts are not covered under warranty when asking the price I was given $2100 to fix both of them.  My suv will not start sometimes, the security system locks me out of dosen't read my key or keyless entry.  I don't this have that kinda of money to put into the truck.  I have to pay for xm and park the truck in the garge most of the time. I took it to the dealership and they looking like you have to pay out of pocket why isn't it covered it's an electrical problem."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Zut, 05/17/2010,Nightmare,3,"I have owned this vehicle from day one. Within the first year I experienced broken door handles, power door module caught fire, broken rear defroster. SInce, I have had 3 ingition switch failures, had to replace all lifters to due poor design. Most recently, the rear hatch plastic cover above window with the center brake light flew off while driving. This was an absolute nightmare of a vehicle and goes to the problems GM has. I bought it because I wanted professional grade. I was so wrong. Also own 2 G5's for my daughters and replaced both engines within the first 3,000 miles. Nice."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Matt S, 09/08/2005,Outstanding SUV,4,"I bought this vehicle last month and haven't had any problems with it at all.  The third row seat is a great extra and I love the  amount of space inside.  The larger V8 engine really helps with pickup and performance.  Unfortunately, it doesn't help with gas mileage.  In town I'm only getting around 14 mpg.  On the long trip though I was able to get 21 mpg.  But fuel economy wasn't a concern when I purchased the large SUV.  Having room for 2 adults, one child, 3 dogs, and luggage was my concern, and this vehicle provides more than enough.  Plus all the luxury of leather, navigation system, etc.  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Michael T, 12/10/2008,Exactly what I wanted,4,"The inline 6 cylinder engine is very powerful and sacrifices little fuel economy. The ride is sublime. More cupholders upfront would be nice. The seats are very supportive and the 4 wheel drive is capable with its auto feature. The transmission is competent, but would have done better with GM's superb six-speed. The interior layout is intuitive and there are no major plastic creaks and rattles when driving. Steering is light and agile, possibly too much for a large midsize truck? The back is cavernous and can haul almost anything."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,budlite1013, 11/21/2009,Nice SUV,3,"I really like my 2006 Envoy, but since I bought it in April 2009, I've had to replace a regulator for my fan, and a drivers door switch, for a total cost of about $1000.00. I'm hoping this is the end of the electrical problems. I suggest you buy extended warrenty and make sure it includes electrical. I wish these were as reliable as they Jimmys!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Jaime, 09/14/2005,Great Family Vehicle!,4,"I wanted a smaller SUV...traded in my Ford Expedition, and decided on the Envoy Denali for my family vehicle, and also to pull our boat.  It handles like a dream, and we don't even feel the boat when we're pulling it.  The only complaint with the whole vehicle is the lack of legroom in the backseat when adults are in the front seat....otherwise a beautiful SUV!"
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,JW, 11/21/2005,Disappointing,2,"I drove a 2002 Envoy for 50,000 miles-- Drove like a dream. For 1000 miles and 3 sets of tires this SUV handles very poorly on the expressway from 60-80 MPH. I would not recommend this SUV-- apparently GM thinks sloppy vibrating SUVS are acceptable.  Trying to return under the Lemon Law. Not sure what they changed from 2002 to the Envoy Denali XL--just buyer beware.   I regret that it is a miserable ride at higher speeds and my worst lifetime auto purchase. I would recommend that you buy something else until they fix this problem or GM begins to care about their consumers again.  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Charley, 01/03/2006,Most vehicle for the money,4,"I looked at several mid-sized SUVs including the XC 90 and the MDX.  The Envoy, by far, gives you more for your money than the others.  A wonderful vehicle that is a joy to drive."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Mona, 08/20/2005,Check it good before you buy,3,"I had always wanted an Envoy. I liked the style and design.  When the employee discount came on, I thought I would take advantage. I got it at the beginning of June and 2 weeks later I had it in the shop. The AC compressor was no good so they had to exchange it. A month later i had to take it back in because the passenger side would leak in when it rained outside. I'm not to happy about it but, oh well."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,TK, 11/11/2005,Denali 2WD - WOW!,4,"We transitioned from a van and didn't want to decrease the interior comfort. The Denali is unbelievable - my wife has spent the last week learning all the programming. For buyers, the 2006 Denali is the only way to get V8/DOD, and is only $150 more than comparably equipped SLT version once you figure V8 price into it. Rear seats recline - Tahoe/Yukon don't. XL version allows for open 2nd row, with exit over main floor of car instead of wheelwell. Same price range as Honda Pilot but no comparison. This is true midpoint between full SUV and van. DVD headphones are cordless, BOSE speakers awesome, exterior look is clean. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Eddie, 12/18/2005,Excellent Car,5,"I had the 04 Envoy XUV, it was good but need something with seating so I got the Envoy Denali. It handles great in all kind of weather and is fun to drive."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Johnny Dayton, 01/11/2006,Best Overall SUV for $45k or less,4,"I test drove ALL SUVs that could carry 6+ passengers and drag at least 5,500 lbs.  This is the best overall vehicle for the money.  Reviews about the soft suspension tuning are right - which makes it ride extremely smooth on the road (which is where it will stay for most of its life).  Big V-8 engine is great, with mediocre fuel economy.  User selectable 2WD or 4WD and self- leveling suspension in the back are great.  Interior quality is good.  Getting the same vehicle in a foreign manufacturer would cost $10k more - with a dubious return on that investment."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Brandon, 01/31/2006,Very happy,4,"I recently purchaseed a new, GMC Envoy XL Denali for my wife.  We absolutely love it.  We replaced our Infiniti with it and are extremely happy with the GMC.  The ride comfort is far superior to the new, Ford Explorer.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone searching for a new SUV. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Bob, 03/21/2006,A lot for the money,4,"Test drove Nissan, Toyota and Dodge 6 Passenger SUVs.  For the money this should be a number one consumer choice.  The absolute comfort and drivability of this vehicle is dynamic.  Build quality is equal to Toyota and superior to Dodge and Nissan.  Engine is superior in power and equally as smooth as Toyota 4.7V8 with same gas milage. One draw back on our purchase is no back up alarm or camera with Nav system.  Interior is roomy for adults and again superior in comfort. Full spectrum of options with great layout and nice quality touch and movement.  Simple and sold well designed and priced vehicle.  Highly recommended for a family.        "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,David Borchelt, 05/31/2006,Great Performance and Comfort,5,Vehicle handles well both on the highway and in shopping malls. The dispalcement on demand saves on fuel without any loss of performance. As a bonus the engine is E85 capable  The nav system is easy to use and the xm radio makes trips more enjoyable.Third row seats provide plenty of extra room for the family and easily flip down to accommodate large packages. Interior is well designed and the front leg and headroom are more than adequate.  
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,DB, 06/10/2006,2006 GMC Envoy,4,"I purchased a GMC Envoy XL (SLT) in March of 2006. My criteria included stability control, 7-passenger seating, side curtain air bags, and decent towing. I also looked at the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota 4 Runner, Toyota Sequoia, Ford Explorer, and Chevy Tahoe.  I ended up choosing the GMC Envoy for a combination of value and capabilities.  As an avid Consumer Reports subscriber I was hesitant in purchasing this vehicle but I am very pleased with my decision.  I obtained a very good price with a combination of GM dollars, incentives and a discount from the dealer and the vehicle has more than met my expectations in providing a smooth and quiet ride into work with decent MPG."
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,gl, 09/21/2006,Great Style,4,"Like the interior and dash layout.  Love the way it drives, very quiet and feels solid.  Looked for a long time for something with 3 rows that was not a V8 and was roomy enough for my family and their legs.  This has fit the bill. First brand new car I've ever purchased. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Andrea, 11/16/2006,Great SUV,4,"I've had my Envoy a few weeks now and love it.  After test driving the Mountaineer, Sequoia, Rendevous, Yukon, and TrailBlazer, I knew this was the one.  My kids love it as well.  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,CLAUDIA RATLIFF, 12/12/2006,GMC Envoy,4,"I find that this vehicle has superior handling, really smooth.  The inside instruments make this a driver friendly vehicle.  Also is a ""10"" on personal comfort zones. "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,ToJo3194, 12/19/2006,Envoy or Envy ? You decide,4,"Car rides great. Interior could use some improvement on the SLE Package, since I would have expected more for a $30K vehicle.  I am a little worried about the reliabilty of the engine and power train, since I heard both good and bad reviews.  "
gmc,envoy-xl,2006,Mark Brown, 12/31/2006,Reliable Family Vehicle,4,"Within 30 days of purchase, the power steering pump went out. I thought, Oh no, not a lemon?  Fortunately, in the 18 months since purchase, this has been the only repair. A far cry from my days of owning a Land Rover Discovery! Anyway, we live in a high alpine ski resort (Telluride, CO) and with a family of 5, we are tough on our vehicle. The gas mileage is consistently 16.5mpg and the peppy engine has plenty of power for mountain roads. Extremely quiet and comfortable ride on what can be punishing highways. Love the heated seats. Fold down seats are great for hauling larger items. Very pleased with our purchase! Highly recommended! The OnStar system is super in the mountains too."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,newfnlab, 01/06/2012,It's a LEMON!,2,"I bought this vehicle new (very expensive). I have replaced over $1000 in rear door latches, obviously a defect,they only warrant 1 yr or 20K km, what does km have to do with a latch. GM head office doesn't like to return phone calls..
I finally spoke to her again & their decision was ""your on your own"".
I have replaced the transfer case 1 1/2 yrs ago, now I have to replace the motor in it.Stranded again when gear shifter broke (it's plastic) go figure. No speadometer for over a year now (called cluster) would cost over $1000, neither heated seats work. My list goes on. I take care of my vehicles but this is ridiculous. GM does NOT stand behind their products. I will NEVER own another one."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Faith, 08/12/2015,Smart Idea - Poor repair record,3,"The SUV that literally turns into a pickup is a great idea. Being able to lay a full sheet of drywall or plywood flat in the rear cargo area is another great design. My issue with the vehicle is all the repairs that have had to happen and I barely have break in mileage on the vehicle at 78,000. I've had to replace the thermostat; it's had 3 sets of tires; the front and rear sway bar links have been replaced; when I am sitting at a stop, the speedometer reads as high as 40 (this number varies at different times). Other instrument panel gauges often show the wrong information. And last but not least, I am now experiencing issues with the transmission. I've owned other GM vehicles and this has been my least favorite experience as far as repairs. I like the vehicle overall. I just don't thing I should have so many repair bills for 78,000 miles.
I did have to replace the transmission ($2,900). I also had to have the instrument panel overhauled ($200). In addition, the midgate window regulator had to be replaced because one day it went down and wouldn't go back up. The vehicle recently turned 95,000 miles and finally seems to be in good working order. We'll see! Recent repair (08/2020) was a cracked fuel tank.It now has 106,000 miles.

gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,chris2004envoy, 11/22/2012,2004 Envoy XUV SLT,4,"I have owned this vehicle for 6 years now,
use it to tow skidoos in the winter,
hauled just about everything in the back,
drywall, garden supplies, wood,
fridges,
an oven etc.
It now has 160,000 km on it and has suffered what I would consider less than average issues.
Common problems for all Envoy models are the front bearings, instrument cluster and the inline 6 has a fairly light duty exhaust manifold which in my case cracked.
The good news is the parts are easy to buy aftermarket replacements and I replaced the bearings myself.
I found a guy who replaced all the faulty motors in the cluster too for 200$ cash and the exhaust manifold was 1000 dollar fix.
Not bad for 9 years +"
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Baldbcool, 05/08/2004,XUV is the place to be,4,"I really love my XUV.  I went looking 
at the Durangos, Trailblazers and 
Volvos.  The interiors were all 
cheesy.  As soon as I say in the XUV I 
was hooked.  The leather heated seats 
keep you warm and wrap around you.  The 
retractable roof is a plus since I 
traded in my Ram for it.  The V6 is 
powerful enough for what I need.  The 
only negative is my own fault.  I 
bought a black one and black is no fun

the tailgate regulator has broken 3 times and been replaced because it locks us out of the trunk, the mid-gate regulator is currently broken, it has always had some mysterious shake at idle, gm told us that was just part of the car. The speedometer has been stuck at 120mph for the past year, the drivers seat (power) only works sometimes. and its only got 100k miles, it does have one of the best rides i have ever seen, and the 5.3 v8 does have great power..

gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,DRS, 08/12/2006,Exactly What I Wanted!,4,"I got the XUV to have a new vehicle to drive to my son's college graduation in May 2004.  We fell in love with it during the trip.  We had 3 rather large adults for the 1000 mile trip out to the college and we all were amazingly comfortable.  After 3+ years the automobile continues to please the family.  I have had it back to the dealership only for the recommended service at 6000 and 12000 miles.  The OnStar phone has become a necessity. Beware the phone on my OnStar uses analog technology and will need to be upgraded to digital by 2008.  This ""conversion"" costs about $400, but gets you OnStar telephone service for 3 years, which appears to be a good deal if you are going to use it."

Can't remember what it was that was replaced but it was pricey.  A year later, same exact thing.  We've been able to get by, since then, by carrying a battery charger with us.  If the system shuts down, we're stranded.  Yesterday, the battery would not charge and we were towed to the dealer, again!  We've always had Hondas and have never had any problems whatsoever.  My husband was reluctant to buy a GMC product.  Only reason we bought this was because of the sliding roof feature, which we've only used once or twice in 6 years.  We'll stick with Hondas next time.

Do not know what is wrong with it yet. It is a good truck for long trips, Vacations and picking up supplies and items.  I like the style of the body, and the way it handles the road.

gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,JAMFRETE, 03/08/2010,"Don't buy, bad instrument cluster!",2,"GMC has a known instrument cluster problem whereas all gauges stop working, the speedometer does not register correctly, but GM will not perform a recall even though it is a factory defect.   $500 to $1000 to fix the problem out of the consumers pocket.  GM should be ashamed of themselves!  Never again!"
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Tim C, 01/06/2005,Envoy XUV - ALMOST PERFECT,4,"We were going to buy a Nissan Murano but after test driving the XUV we went with it. The best thing about this vehicle is the retractable roof and it offers a SMOOTH ride, something we didn't expect. This vehicle compared to the Murano wins hands down. The price is pretty reasonable for this vehicle. The blind spots is what keeps this vehicle from being perfect. Its very hard to see out the back and even harder to see small cars but even with this flaw its still a great vehicle."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,PhilipJohn52, 12/20/2003,Envoy XUV - The NEW KING of the Road!,4,"This vehicle rides like a luxury car 
but hauls better than a pickup, with 
the ability to haul an enclosed load or 
an open, tall load...true versatility.  
The durability of the rear bumper cover 
is questionable, and useful life of all 
the motors/switches used to power the 
retractable roof and cargo-area windows 
is yet to be determined.  Only time 
will tell, but if the watertightness of 
the roof seals and the overall 
quietness of the passenger cabin are 
any indications, GMC has delivered a 
real winner!  If your kids are grown 
and you don't need to haul the entire 
soccer team to practice and a five-
passenger capability is sufficient, 
then this SUV is for you!"
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Casper04, 01/08/2004,Did not want a truck...,4,"The XUV is great. It hauls all my DJ

gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Mondoro, 12/28/2006,Best truck I have owned,4,"I owned a 2005 with all the bells and whistles and loved it.  My son totaled it and walked away without a scratch on him.  I was only able to find a 2004 to replace it that had some of the options I wanted.  Would not have been satisfied with another truck style. Everything else I even remotely liked was over $50,000. One terriffic truck to own and drive. By the way the 2004 has a V8 that gets better milage then the six in the 2005."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,nikkole, 05/05/2008,Love it,4,"I bought this truck because I own a couple of properties and I have to occasionally lug around doors and things. So this truck isnt my everyday car but I love driving it. It is so comfy and I love the design with the fold down seats and the roll off roof. I already moved a huge cabinet and it was perfect for the job! Its also a great ""dog"" truck. I have 3 dogs and love to take them for drives. I havent rinsed out the back cargo area yet but I was told that was an option. You can't fit seven people but when do you drive 7 people around? Its great for people who want the utility of a pickup truck but want the ""wholeness"" of an SUV. I love it!"
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,rwedens, 02/22/2004,Very Nice SUV,4,"This is the quitest SUV I have ever 
driven.  Even with the rear glass down 
and the roof retracted there was no 
increase in road noise.  The ride is a 
little soft but it takes bumps and pot 
holes very well.  I had no trouble 
picking up a new dryer in it's box.  
Just retracted the roof and instant 
pickup bed.  The straight six with 225 
HP has plenty of power.  Make sure you 
get the optional Driver Information 
System with steering wheel controls.  I 
got 16 MPG on my third tank of gas (in 
2WD HI range)."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,heatherc, 07/26/2010,"OK vehicle, but would not buy again.",3,"We bought the XUV because it was very unique and fit our needs at the time.  It was great at first, but over the past few years has had many issues.  The midgate glass window shattered when raising it one time.  The reargate window motor has broken twice in the past 3 years and gets stuck down (and then you can't open the rear door.)  The rear door ""sensor"" has malfunctioned a few times where it takes me about 5 minutes of messing around with it to get the door open.  And the instrument cluster is bad (according to the dealership).  My speedometer and oil pressure gauges don't work.  Currently debating whether to spend $1000 to get it ""fixed"" or buy a different vehicle. "
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,r.brown, 08/11/2005,What a great ideal of an open cargo roof,4,"This is a great all around SUV. I needed a pickup truck to haul things every now and then. So the XUV fit the bill, almost to a T. The only problem is you need to leave the tailgate down when hauling 8ft. drywall.  But it's a great vehile. I recently, sold it because, I have Range Rover as my daily SUV and I have a pickup how to haul 8ft. stuff. If the Yuhon XL was avaliabe in an XUV, I would have one."

everything you will need for

the back with a hose. Much more 
comfortable than our former Ford

excellent. I don't know what the 
review that said it was spongey. You 
want spongey, drive my old Ford 
Explorer.  The turning radius isn't 
great when making those u-turns for 
garage sales, though. Also, mileage is 
averaging 13 MPH town and 16 MPH road, 
not that great.  A problem with 
visibility out the back window, it's a 
bit too high to see those little cars 
behind you. "

vehicle, all the creature comforts you 
will ever want or need. With sunroof, 
midgate window, backdoor window & roof 
open, it feels like a pseudo 
convertible. Trunk door is ingeneuous. 
An engineering masterpiece. The 
flexibility is fantastic. The shape is 
similar to an ACURA MDX (at quick 
glance) which is a simple & pleasing 
shape. Very balanced in terms of its 
masculinity and feminine design appeal/ 
image. Nice color selection. Since it's

gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,dsharone, 03/31/2004,Definitely A Vehicle Worth Having,4,"I purchased my XUV in March 2004 and I 
have not been disappointed as of yet. 
GMC did a great job on designing this 
SUV (XUV). The roof retracts 
flawlessly. The ride is cushiony; 
handles bumps and potholes like the 
more expensive vehicles. My truck has 
the 1SB package (Onstar, built-in 
phone, heated mirrors, etc.)but even 
without all that the vehicle would be 
an excellent choice, because it comes 
standard with goodies. I have not 
regretted my decision in the least. 
The midglass that separates the cargo 
area is a wonderful addition. All I 
can say is, get it before GMC realizes 
the goldmine that they have and raises 
the price. "

like those in a limo - best thing for 
pet owners.

I'm REALLY satisfied with the customer

untouchable for a vehicle of it class. 
If GM continue with this pattern of car

like a car than a truck which surprised 
me due to the size and weight. Great 
for our dogs and easy to clean up after 
them. Very quiet with the mid glass up. 
Only complaint is that you can't leave 
the top open and the rear window 
closed. That would work best for the 
dogs to give them air and still be 
enclosed. Lots of neat programable

The versitility of the back end is great.  Our dog rides back there most of the time and we don't have to worry about her muddy feet.  The only problem we had was a high pitched whine in the passenger side speaker.  They replaced the battery cable and that fixed it.

Check engine light keeps coming on, keeps stalling, and has had many parts replaced, such as egnishion, flush of fluids, they had to take apart my transmission, the brakes keep jumping, sometimes things work sometimes they don't.  I love the look of the SUV but that is it!  Too many problems for a Brand New SUV."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Bill Stryker, 12/18/2005,GMC Envoy XUV,5,"My XUV is a very versitile vehicle. I love it for hauling dogs, tall cargo like trees from the nursury and other big or dirty stuff in the back cargo area. The passenger compartment is first class and comfortable. I love the automatic windshield wipers. I have the V8 version which has plenty of pick up and really goes. I think the fuel mileage is very good for the size of the engine and vehicle. I really will never have another vehicle without OnStar. When my lease is up I am going to get another just like it.  "
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Ron, 03/22/2006,GMC XUV,4,"Extremely versatile vehicle.  I needed something that could double as a pickup truck, carry 5 passengers and still have the option of leaving open the rear area like a pickup.  Large items can be placed in rear with moderate ease, and still be able to tow a reasonable Gross Vehicular Weight. Very comfortable drive but slightly underpowered with the V6 engine.  When towing the V8 would be my choice now.  Overall I can't think of another vehicle that would fit the need."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Nutreo, 03/19/2007,Best Truck I'Ve Owned,4,"I've driven this truck for nearly 3 years and love almost everything about it.  It' the most versatile SUV on the planet.  Whether it's taking my dogs to the beach, pulling a 7000-lb. boat, taking Boy Scouts on a campout, going skiing through feet of new snow, taking recycling to the dump or anything else, nothing handles it like the XUV.  I got the V8 4x4 with air suspension, navigation, sunroof, heated seats, Bose, etc.  Very comfortable, very reliable, gas mileage improves with age, retractable roof and a midgate with electric window (the way the Avalanche midgate should be!) allow for incredible shifts in function.  Can't understand why GMC only made it the one year."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,John Maloney, 04/12/2007,GMC Envoy XUV,4,This is a great vehicle. Smooth riding and not too bad on the gas.17.5mpg average for 3 years. The only problems I've had have bee electrical and they have all been fixed with a minimum of time and under warenty. When you open the sunroof and put down the windows and rear top it feels like a convertible.
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,stephanie, 08/13/2007,Awesome,5,"OK, so this car was like my first car and it's so awesome! At first I thought since it was kind of big, and clunky, and costs a fortune to put gas in, (which it does), that it was going to be horrible. But, its so fun! I love how I can fit all of my friends in there, and just go out for a night on the town!! Its amazing! (I dont recommend it for older people though). But yea. Ive had it 4 6 months now and its been like a friend to me. The seats are comfortable, it rides smooth, and its gorgeous. And after my parents kicked me out of the house, I had to live in my car for like about a month, and its so comfortable to sleep in. I love this car!"
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Tiny Feet, 03/06/2008,Love My XUV!,4,"I love everything about the Envoy XUV.  It's extremely dependable both for performance and comfort  My friends also say how comfortable it is to ride in and drive.  I have a 2004 model and have never had 1 problem with it! And I have about 65,000 miles on it.  "
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Vinnie, 03/18/2008,Pretty Cool,3,Very well equipped vehicle. I love the handling as well as the comfort of the ride. Seats five comfortably with room to spare. The only downfall is wheel bearing and ball joint problems. Underpowered and my full size pickup with a V8 gets better fuel economy.
gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,Jamsheri, 02/27/2018,A gem with a fatal flaw :-(,4,"This is a very well appointed vehicle but I believe the programmer who designed the rear technology for this vehicle suffered from delusions of grandeur. The roof mechanism and tailgate/ glass components are fatally integrated and when one goes bad it renders the other useless. When that happens an incessant dinging  alarm sounds continuously while the vehicle is moving making it annoying to drive. Unfortunately, most of the websites that offer any clues on how to fix these things haven't been visited by anyone who can help you since 2014. Even the dealership service department doesn't have any answers without paying whatever they charge to troubleshoot the problem.

gmc,envoy-xuv,2004,DJ, 07/18/2018,Long time buddy,5,"I've owner this great SUV with very little repairs. This year two sensors went. Everything else is basic care. Love the double hatch opening and the ability to carry big objects vertical or horizontal.

I will keep my XUV until it dies, because of how versatile it is (SUV/Pickup). Not to mention how enjoyable it is to drive. I've taken it to the Smokey Mtns, the Ozarks as well as traveled home to Wisconsin from deep South Texas without any problems. To me this is the perfect travel vehicle. "
gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,Joel Larson, 05/25/2010,It only happened to you,2,"At 40,000 miles my my gas gauge quit working and went I went to the dealer he said it's not a warranty and it would cost me over $600.00 to repair. Then, a week later, my control for my fan went out on the 5th speed and a week later the 4 speed went out. again the dealer seem to very surprised and said wow this never happens either and for 500.00 they could fix the switch. What I find amazing is my wife's van made by Chevrolet  has the exact same problem. GMC have to be aware of this problem but they don't care and people wonder why imports are doing well. We also have a 94 Honda in our family with 200,000 miles and we've done nothing except oil changes and tires. "
gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,GREENER, 11/19/2005,"If you find one, buy it!",4,"Rides like a dream.  Looks exceptional, performs like a top of the line SUV should.  Handles great in bad weather.  OnStar gives me an added feeling of security, knowing that my wife and children are safe @ all times and just a push button away from help, allows me to rest easy.  Sheer comfort!  A joy to drive and plenty of room for all of us and our things.  Towing capabilities are huge.  I tow a 22 foot fishing boat with no trouble.  The sliding rear roof feature has come in handy for my wife a couple times already.  Bringing home large trees and shrubs for the garden, and I used it to bring home a new refrigerator.  The only knock I could give, the gas mileage could be better.  "

gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,BJ, 03/17/2006,Love It !,4,"We have used this vehicle constantly since purchase. It has been used for trips and pulling our trailer.  It is not quite 7 months and we have over 18,000 miles on it.  It has not failed us once!  The far back area is used for our 4 dogs.  With the window separating it from the seating area the flying fur is no longer a problem.  To clean it you just need a hose.  What a pleasure this vehicle is.  The best ever!!!!! "

gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,dakotaqueen61, 08/20/2005,My XUV,3,They poorly planned the console/CD holder area.  It's not convenient or safe to use while driving.  CD's do not go in and out easily
gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,Gordon, 11/08/2008,Dependable Alternative,4,"I purchased the XUV after owning a 3/4 ton Avalanche. When gas prices started soaring, I worried about the 8.1L engine, but still wanted the utilitarian rear area. I have the 5.3L DOD (Active Fuel Management) engine and have owned the vehicle for a little over three years. I have had no problems with the vehicle and highly recommend it. I own a 22ft Toy Hauler trailer that weighs in at about 5,600lbs with water and ATV and use the Envoy to tow it.  I have towed from Idaho to South Dakota and over 6% or better grades in the mountains around the area, and the truck tows great! This is a great alternative to a 1/2 pickup if you don't need the bed."

gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,Sleepy, 11/24/2009,Swiss Army Knife of SUVs,4,"I'd seen these for years and finally bought one. Very handy for a pet owner with 2 big dogs. Used the sliding roof several times when getting items home. The cylinder deactivation probably helps some, but not huge. V8, heavy vehicle, & still 19-20 mpg highway - not bad. Plenty of power, even when loaded. Very comfortable on road trips. Tons of interior space, always enough room. No storage compartments in the cargo b/c of hard plastic, so I made a wooden truck box for jumper cables, first aid kit, tie downs, dog ramp, etc... Also, the tailgate won't stay open when swung open like a door and parked on a downhill. "
gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,Gillian Trojan, 07/07/2005,2004 Envoy XUV,4,"I love my Envoy XUV, but I do agree that the suspension is a little soft when cornering.  My biggest complaint is that, for a woman, there are no little cubby-holes for stuff - sunglasses, pen, etc.  There's the armrest, but that's not convenient to reach and dig around in when driving.  There might have been a compartment over the mirror, except that with the XUV that has been taken up with the buttons to operate the moving parts. The other item is that there are tie- down rings, but not enough - you have to move them if you want it in another angle - couldn't GM just add all the tie-down rings?  Other than that, I love my XUV."
gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,Bill, 09/26/2005,Great - Except...,4,"After about 20,000 miles the check engine light came on then off.  It does this reguarly about 1000 miles off and 100 on.  By the time I get a dealer appointment it is off again.  Other than that an excellent buy."

gmc,envoy-xuv,2005,Jurban, 11/11/2004,2004 Envoy XUV SLT V8,4,"Overall, this SUV is a very nice 
vehicle and pleasure to drive. 

I choose the 5.3 liter V8 option; not 
so much for the towing but for better 
acceleration, slightly better city gas 
milage; plus when loaded down it pulls 
with little effort.

Additionally, I find the vehicle has an 
extremley ""Big Car Like"" ride. However, 
the vehicle does tend to lean a bit 
around turns and could perhaps use some 
sort of anti-swaybar system.

Would I recommend the Envoy line of 
SUV's absolutely!  I think It is a fine 
choice for anyone who wants to have a 
classy ride and great utility features 
to boot.  "

I really like the ride package, seat comfort, and handling characteristics. Fuel mileage has been getting better with additional miles on the clock, and I'm getting almost 18MPG in mixed driving.  I bought a rear carpet/floormat and a tie down package at the dealership that gets you more rings to attach stuff to. Too bad these trucks have been discontinued.

I have spent $3500 in repairs in the last 6 months. I've taken it to three different mechanics and technicians.Every single part on my brake is brand new, and the ABS light is still on. I can't afford to keep it anymore, so this is a good car if you are a mechanic or have a mechanic who knows who he is doing.  

BUT this has saved me through the winter. With All-Season tires it plowed through 2 feet of snow and 2 inches of ice. No weather condition stopped me, and I was incredibly thankful. (Maine Winter of 2014-2015)"
gmc,jimmy,2000,mike, 03/09/2009,2000 jimmy,3,"This is for all jimmy (2000) owners,that have a noise in font that knowone can find. In this model it's the condenser/heater core loose in it's housing. The gas gauge quits working properly because the fuel in Canada still contains a particular addative that has been removed in the US, where these fuel tank sensor where made,they get corroded in places and fail. Early failer of the front wheel bearings are do to just plain old ""bad design"" and low quality."

Then I had to replace the rear wiper motor and rear door lock, the front wiper motor, the radiator, the spider injectors, the front wheel bearings, the window and lock controls never worked right, the 4x4 actuator has to looked at before the first snow fall because it has failed me many times. Thanks to gmc I'll never never buy an American car! Again"

Brakes yearly. Fuel pump. Major valve job. Alternators every 18 months. New battery every 3 years.  Fantastic to drive, (live in Western Canada)  Horrible to maintain. The double edged is that it does what it's supposed to but at high maintenance. Rear wiper motor is absolute rubbish. Shocks are on their way out. Put the best tyres you can afford on it and it stays on the road in the worst conditions.   Gas mileage leaves something to be desired."

Let's not forget to mention that I have to replace brakes every year and the fact that my fuel light comes on at about 170-180 miles on a fulltank of gas. Stay away from this truck.

SLS, 2dr, 2w dr.",4,"The main issue I have with the SUV are the blind spots, very hard to see people coming up beside you, in parking lots, etc., you really have to turn your head, because I don't trust the mirrors, all the time, esp. in heavy traffic, when driving. I had a problem with the radiator early on, because GMC told customers to put the wrong antifreeze in it, after pouring stop leak in for yrs & replacing coolant way too much, I finally replaced the radiator in 2012. It does go through alternator's, fairly quick, over 20yrs, I've replaced the alternator 3x's. I also replaced the fuel pump in 2013, the drivers side motor for the electric window, & once the orginal distributor cap goes(mine lasted for at least 12yrs), you will have to replace it about every yr, but I got one from Autozone, priced around $50, cap & rotor, w/ a lifetime warranty & they replaced it for free. Everything else has been basic repairs for its age. I do think for a $20,000+ SUV, the interior could've been built a little better. I have really made the effort to take care of the interior, replaced sm. broken pieces or had them repaired, so it doesn't look like its 20yrs old! This truck has only left me stranded 1 time & it was my fault for not having it looked at when the alternator started to go the 1st time. I can't say that about many cars, esp. at this age!

this vehicle has had so many

rear pinion seals TWICE recurrent

The first six months we owned it, it was in the shop for 8 weeks total because of nagging problems with the anti theft system locking up and making the engine shut dow or not start at all.  Loads of rattles, brake noise and squeeks.  Plus the infamous ""vortec"" engine sounds worse than a John Deere tractor...lots of metalic thrashing when under acceleration."

Seats suck back hurts after 30 minutes after driving. the dash is cracked very bad. Door panel rattles and ripped off when i closed the door one time. Dash lights broke twice. pivment arm went out.

Yes, it's had a few problems, but it was just normal wear-and-tear (rusty differential cover, O2 sensors, old block heater line). Overall, this vehicle is good, but not for its city driving. On average, I received about 9 - 12 mpg city, 13 - 16 highway, which is about what the much larger Tahoe/Yukon gets now. Offroad, it is extremely fun. I do prefer the much larger SUVs though, and that was my biggest regret in buying the Jimmy, although this so-called ""mid-size"" SUV (it is pretty long, actually) has proven to be extremely substantial and capable. Just take care of it and it runs fine!"
gmc,jimmy,2000,Teach2010, 03/24/2010,A Solid All Around Vehicle,2,"It doesn't have the greatest style, highway wind noise is way too loud, the plastic interior feels very cheap and the exterior design is very basic. Those are the cons.  The pros are that it is a very reliable car. I have not had one problem with it. It's driving comfort is quite good and it is good for hauling.  If what you want is a solid vehicle that is reliable and piratical for yourself or a teenager's first car. You would do well with this one."

It has suddenly quit after on a couple instances of long trips-always during hot season- just all electrical quit, had to call AAA once--another time just waited side of the road 1 or 2 minutes, and it started right up and ran ok. Seemed like when it heated up, air running, etc. it happened. No one could ever explain or figure out the problem. So, consequestly, I do not have the confidence I should have in this particular Jimmy. Always loved them before."
gmc,jimmy,2000,SargeWolfe, 04/20/2002,I LOVE this vehicle,4,"37,000 miles in 2 1/2 years and not a 
lick of trouble.  Reliable, strong, 
comfortable, attractive.  Great in snow 
and offroad.  Would definitely buy it 
again.  This vehicle has needed nothing 
in all this time."
gmc,jimmy,2000,dmills77, 11/02/2008,"This is a lemon, buyer beware and read up",2,"We have had nothing but problems with this car. Buyers need to really review what others are saying as they seem to have all similar issues. 4 wheel drive engages itself as you are driving. Heater issues, wiring issues, the list goes on and on. I will never buy a GMC again. Really do your research! Google the make, year and model and read up on them. I can't believe that some of these things that we are having problems with haven't been recalled its obviously issues many are having and over and over again once they are fixed. The worst car we have ever owned!"
gmc,jimmy,2000,terri, 11/20/2008,It's an okay SUV,2,The front interior is too small needs to be roomier. The gas mileage is terrible. The heater core is going on it and it will take eight and a half hours to fix it and more than $800. Why does it have to be that hard to get at the core. The shocks are terrible and I had to replace the ball joints. I like driving it  It has lots of pep I like the looks of it and it has a great heater.
gmc,jimmy,2000,Nicole, 12/16/2008,Piece of Junk,1,"The first year we bought this vehicle, we had no problems. Then it all happened. It only has 95000 kms now and was bought with 75000 kms. There is a knocking noise that happens intermittently that no one knows what it is, the brakes and rotors have been replaced, wheel bearings, the gas gauge hasn't worked for 3 years, the seat handle snapped off, the power window switch on driver side doesn't work, front speakers have blown for no reason oh and we get 200 km's a tank! This is a piece of junk and i would never buy one or any GMC again!"
gmc,jimmy,2000,lucas, 02/03/2009,Happy with my Jimmy,5,"My Jimmy drives very smooth after nine years of straight ownership. No major repairs nor problems with it. I like the way it sits high, but not too high. I also like the gas mileage I get from my 4.6L."
gmc,jimmy,2000,redman, 04/25/2009,Time to unload it,3,"Bought it in 01 with 19000 miles and overall has been a good, dependable ride. Gas mileage is a surprising 23 MPG hwy. Fuel gauge failed, brakes every 20000 miles, and currently having electrical problems(windows, door locks and mirrors quit occassionally). My daughter hit a deer last night so may take insurance settlement and unload it. Will buy another GMC however."
gmc,jimmy,2000,cranky, 05/23/2009,fuel pumps stink!,3,I have put more into the jimmy then I paid for it. Im surprised I didn't see the fuel pump mentioned more.  It has cost me 1200 alone. The ball joints are also a problem but do to roads where I live. I replace them myself to cut cost. I also had electrical problems and replaced the mass air flow sensor 2x. Over all gas mileage good comp to 98 ply voyager mini van. I enjoy driving it when it's running and it hasn't left me stranded w/ 3 kids. Also back seat too small for 2 kids w/ car seats.
gmc,jimmy,2000,Norb Turner, 01/15/2008,2000 GMC Jimmy,4,"This truck has been nothing but great to me.  I take excellent care of it, and in the four years I've had it I've minimal problems.  I've also been able to do a lot of customization to the truck.  "
gmc,jimmy,2000,gmcjimmy2000, 06/13/2009,Average in all regards,3,"Got my 2000 Jimmy when it had 32,000 miles. Overall, I've liked it, although it's been about average in all regards. Had to do little maintenance repairs pretty frequently ($100 here, $70 there), and ""major"" repairs have included front rotor and fuel pump, which hurt the pocketbook. Also own a Toyota, which has more miles on it but has required fewer repairs, which doesn't build confidence in the Jimmy. Like the engine for a V6 and the vehicle is fun to drive. Interior is average, back seats not too comfortable for full-sized person. Lots of room with rear seats folded down. "
gmc,jimmy,2000,HEIDI, 07/24/2009,Not a favorite,3,"Bought this used.  Had a 1995 Villager that need some money be put into it so figured would be better off with a newer vehicle.  Well I was wrong.  In the year since I have purchased this I have spent more money in repairs then I would have had to do to the Villager.  Plus now a monthly payment.  Fuel pump, hubs both sides, passenger needs it done again. Ball joints, brakes done right before I bought, needs COMPLETE brake job again. It's nice looking and good in the snow but that's about it. Dont buy. They are horrible."
gmc,jimmy,2000,barnold, 08/03/2009,lemon,2,"Replaced ball joints twice, ignition switch, oil cooler lines, drivers side door window actuator, brakes every year, broken gas gauge, blown speakers, overheating problem with a/c, transmission at 60k, squeak problem from front end, door hinges,  if this thing was worth anything I would drive it off a Cliff and collect the insurance. I want my money back. Also who let this off the engineers proof w/ out further inspection. "
gmc,jimmy,2000,gtsxtt, 01/10/2010,GMC,4,"This SUV has only left me stranded when the alternator went out. I bought a new one 100$. The pitman arm was bad and caused swaying all over the road and unresponsive steering replaced it and it was all fixed. I am now at 102,000 miles and have had no other problems. I have maintained it myself per gm suggestions and it still runs like new no smoke or anything, I get 25mpg on premium when light on the throttle. Not much bad I can say about the vehicle. just maintain them and they'll run a long time. It has got me through 6 winters some snow ice and mud and a bunch of hills."

the family LOVES, so my little Jimmy is 
just used to haul me to work and back.  
It's just the right size for me (the 
Yukon is a little scary to drive for 
me).  We had an oil leak from day one, 
and took 4 trips back to the dealer to 
fix, and the headlights were WAY out of 
wack, but other than that, no real 
issues.  My lease is up in 8 months, 
and will probably turn it in.  I have 
my heart set on the RX300"

repeated repairs including wheel 
bearings, pinion seals, electrical, 
ignition switch, brakes, the list is 
endless.  Finally took a beating and 
traded it in (with 3 more problems) 
for a Honda CRV and what a world of 
difference.  I am sorry I every bought

poor quality."

it to Maine.In 2 years we have had no 
repairs, just maintanence. We have

This last year was by far the worst, everything my diagnostic a few years ago told me would go wrong: did. But what do u expect?

Main repeat issues: both doors kept breaking hinges. Both seat adjust handles were broken off from the time I bought it & it's an impossible to fix, so no reclining my seats for 7 years. Heater stopped working 2 years ago (expensive fix to lift engine & change a $5 part). Engine light always on due to fuel cap being loose."
gmc,jimmy,2000,BigDad77, 03/02/2002,Rattle Box,2,"I leases this SUV new in 2000.  All I can say is it spark knox, every piece of cheap plastic inside rattles, the tailgate release broke, the steering makes a popping snap sound, the handle to recline the front seat snapped off.

going bad, trim was peeling on roof 
rack."
gmc,jimmy,2000,Ben, 07/23/2005,Love It!,4,"A great SUV! I bought it 2 years ago, and never had a major problem with it. I drive it a lot. It now has 87,000 miles on it and it still runs great. The only things that have gone wrong are the back window had to be replaced (seal was broken) and I just had to replace the battery. The drivers door sqeaks a little and I wish the fuel tank was bigger. All in all, it's been a great running, comfortable vehicle for me and my family."
gmc,jimmy,2000,Bin Good, 10/27/2005,It's been good... few flaws,4,"I purchased my Jimmy brand new, and have enjoyed it so far.  The leather seats are super comfortable, and it has a good ride.  So far, most things have worked.  The defects I've experienced are the battery and the turn signal switch.  The factory battery was defective, and to make a long story short, I'm on my third battery!! Acid leaked out of the other two.  I can't really blame Jimmy for that...  After 91,000 miles, my turn signal switch has gone out (I think) there is a blinking noise eventhough the blinkers aren't on."
gmc,jimmy,2000,DON'T BUY THIS SUV!, 12/14/2005,"Horrible, Horrible SUV",1,"This SUV has been nothing short of a horror story for me. Quickly running down the problems/repairs: wheel bearings (too many to acurrately remember), rear wiper motor, fuel pump,defective gas guage, ball joints, turn signal defect, blown both front speakers, handle to raise/lower seat back broke off, horrible accelleration/power, and very low heat that keeps recurring even after I get the heater core flushed. The car rides so horribly that it feels as if the wheels are going to fall off. I bought the truck w/ 22000 miles and it's been a nightmare since day one. Do not ... I repeat Do Not buy this SUV!!  Ask any mechanic .. these things are notorious for all the problems I've listed and more"

it..other then that i love this 
thing..."
gmc,jimmy,2000,Mixed Bag, 03/13/2006,Mixed bag,3,"Bought the vehicle used for work. Gotta love those GM engineers! $800.00 for wheel bearing replacements every 30,000?!!!? Shoulda read up on the Edmunds Forum! Otherwise so-so performance. 4WD works well. Tight fit for a big guy. Milage for this type of vehicle is not too bad. Avg. 16 if I don't use the 4WD. I bought this based on my excellent experience with a 1999 Silverado, but I don't think I'll buy another Jimmy."
gmc,jimmy,2000,BJ, 08/02/2006,Diamond in the rough,3,"Overall, the Jimmy is a good SUV. The main problem encountered with the car was front end repairs and numerous brake replacements. Good performance and average comfort. For the money not a bad buy."

probs what so ever. "
gmc,jimmy,2000,figgy, 07/31/2004,UPSET,3,"Loved it until last week. With only 
32,ooo miles on it the engine seized 
up. It will cost almost $4,000 to 
replace the engine. Don't know why this 
happened. Oil was changed as 
recommended and vehicle was not 
mistreated in any way. It was running 
fine before and then just died in the 
middle of traffic. Of course the 
warranty has expired so there's not 
much I can do but fix it. I'm not happy 
and will probably not buy another GMC. 
I could understand this happening if 
this vehicle had 75,000 miles on it or 
was over an older model and not taken 
care of. WHAT'S UP GMC?"
gmc,jimmy,2000,The Milbers, 03/10/2003,"Something good, something bad",3,"Problems have included; a squeaky 
clutch, leaking rear wiper hose, small 
hole in body, heat is always on, frozen 
emergency brake line, poor gas mileage. 
All probems fixed except the heat 
always on and the poor gas mileage. 
I've owned 2 other Jimmy/Blazer types, 
1986 and 1994. Both older ones were 
better on fuel, 26 to 28 mpg, and no 
problems with heat. The 2000 gets 22 to 
24 mpg with the 5 speed (clunky 
shifting)standard transmission. Make 
the centre drivers side spark plug 
easier to change and angle the grease 
nipples for easier access on the tie 
rods. An average vehicle with an 
average price. You get what you pay for."
gmc,jimmy,2000,Hoosiersec, 01/01/2005,Nightmare Finally Over,1,"I finally unloaded my Jimmy.  Took a big loss with trade-in. SUV was the biggest money pit I have ever owned.  Performance through first three years was good, but as soon as the warranty expired, bang, the problems occured.  GMC had to know this car was substandard by only offering the 3/36 warranty.  Wheel bearings/ball joints went at 60k-dealer told me I was lucky, as he had seen them ""as early as 14k."" That was $1300. Other problems: driver's door joint fell apart/replaced; rear window hatch rusted/replaced; alt. replaced, etc. I maintained this car meticulously with no off-road. Much of the miles were highway. Reading other similar ownership reviews leads me to believe this car is a lemon!"
gmc,jimmy,2000,Carol Evans, 01/02/2005,Love my Jimmy,4,"I love the handling in snow and ice, the reliability starting in heat and freezing temperatures. Very responsive handling, good cargo room.  I wish the gas mileage was better. This vehicle has a small gas tank just like the Chevy Blazer, and Chevy Trailblazer. This product needs better gas mileage and a larger tank or a hybrid design."
gmc,jimmy,2000,Cat, 02/21/2006,I must be lucky,4,"I bought this truck with 70,000 miles on it already about 3 years ago. I have not had any major problems at all with it since I've owned it, and it's now over 100,000. The only thing so far has been the audible turn signal thing is broken so it clicks even when you don't have the signal on - I've gotten used to it and barely notice it anymore, so I haven't bothered to get it fixed. I like the ease of switching to 4x4. I don't think it handles as well as the Jimmy's previous body style in 2W or 4,but is less bumpy. (I had a 94 Jimmy prior to this one.) I think it's very comfortable and like the power driver seat although passengers don't like the 'lump' in the floor."
gmc,jimmy,2000,gpbacker, 04/28/2006,Would recommend,4,"Reliable vehicle.  Bought used at 50,000 miles.  Had to replace brakes at 75000.  Would like better fuel economy than current 18 mpg, but the initial cost was low enough that it does not matter. "

At 52,181 the ABS pump and master cylinder had to be replaced.  The driver's back seat rest handle broke off and the mileage is horrible.  It also is the noisiest vehicle I have ever driven.  In essence, I have only driven this car 18,339 miles in 4 years (purchased in 2002).  After reading the article in the Detroit Free Press, dated May 23, 2006, re: Dex-Cool, what might happen next??? I also got a printout of previous repairs and it's 2 pages long.  Ford Fusion here I come! I have been a GM customer for 40 years and have always had problems.  I'm DONE.              "

beginning, secondday we had to get the 
antenna wire re-connected to get FM.  
We've had problems with the wheel 
bearings and $800 later it still makes 
a noise.  The windshield wipers froze 
one day and they started crash into 
eachother and I'm afraid to drive in 
the rain now. Sometimes when control is 
in off position they stay up. Rear 
windshield wiper doesn't always work.  
Rattles come from everywhere with all 
the cheap plastic. The suspension 
creaks.  The plastic panels in the back 
fall off for no reason other than the 
little fasteners don't hold.  It has a 
rocky and unconfortable ride, and 
backseat is small."

the extra $$$ for it when I probably wouldn't use it for anything practical.

Fuel pump went just after warranty expired. GM did pay for parts, but there was $300 labor paid by me. Still only have less than 40,000 mi on it. Highway mileage has been as high as 23mpg. Averages about 20. Pickup is very good. Paint and finish still like new, but then this car is stored inside winters. It is 2wd, but we take it everywhere on dirt roads and such in NH. Has never stranded us yet. Ours has overabundance of factory cladding and running boards. With that good finish, and those extras it passes as a new vehicle as no-one is sure what it is."

I bought my beautiful truck used with 100,000 kms and I've had no problem with it other than a few minor things like replacing the battery, very little paint coming off the roofrack, small coolant leak which was quickly fixed by the dealership I bought it from. I love this truck even though the gas mileage stinks bigtime for city driving. Love the cold air, sunroof, and heated leather seats."

gmc,jimmy,2000,Jimmy Hater, 10/28/2007,Do not buy,3,"I have put well over $8000 in repairs to this vehicle. It is a very sharp SUV that was poorly designed. I have replaced ball joints and well bearing hub assemblys multiple times. A small fortune was spent to fix a secondary air induction pump. I would recommend everyone to stay away from purchasing this vehicle. I am not the only one that has these problems, everyone I know with one has the same problems to some extent."
gmc,jimmy,2000,Wyn, 04/11/2008,Worst SUV ever,3,"This SUV was bought brand new. Not a month into driving it had to have the ball joints done. The problems just kept going from there. In total, the ball joints have been replaced 8 times. The master cylinder has been replaced 5 times. Brakes every year and rotors almost every time the brakes get done. Gas gauge sensor had to be fixed. ABS module is broken. Heater core is broken. Shocks need to be done almost every year. Multifunction switch had to be replaced. New battery about once a year. 4x4 gets stuck. There are so many things that need to be done, I don't think I've listed nearly all of the problems. I used to think that this Jimmy just happened to be a lemon but now I know better."
gmc,jimmy,2000,eb, 04/22/2008,Never again,2,"Although I love the way this SUV looks it's been nothing but problems since buying it new. The hazard switch was replaced, 4 wheel drive speed sensor, rear main seal and oil pan gasket, pinion seal and now there is another oil leak in the front of the vehicle. This is the third Jimmy I've owned and will not purchase a GMC again since each one has had succeedingly more problems. This 2000 has been the worst for mechanical problems."

I keep a tune up on it regularly, change the oil every 3000 miles, brake change every year. Great 4WD, I put big tires on mine so goes great through the snow, only complaint I have is the driver door pins keep failing have to replace every 3 or 4 months. Has over 200,000 miles on it and if the engine goes I will probably put a new in, same with the transmission, love my Jimmy!!!

gmc,jimmy,2001,dave, 04/28/2010,good vehicle,4,"Very funny to read comments from those suckers who have been getting ripped off from shady mechanics and blaming GM. 3 waterpumps and you blame GM ? They were garbage aftermarket parts. And ball joints ... get good ones that can be greased and have oil change people lube them -its called maintenence.Your mechanic uses garbage parts and charges you top $ and it's GM's fault ??.. get a clue. Yes you have 125,000 miles and need to get repairs - big surprise. Quit getting ripped off, spend the time to find an honest mechanic -many of you sure don't know one. This is a decent , fun 4 wheel dr that goes great through snow. Love mine."
gmc,jimmy,2001,ramdaddi, 03/15/2013,Money Pit,3,"Yes, very reliable OVER SIZED STATION WAGON.
Awesome in the snow with the original Good Year Wrangler tires but a very expensive vehicle to maintain.
Sealed front wheel bearings and brakes always seem to fail and are costly repairs.
I've had mine for 10 plus years and I just put $2,000 into the breaks, bearings and idler arms or some crap like that and honestly, I'm glad I did.
This ""truck"" is a great work horse, 144k miles, and I love to beat the hell out of it off roading at the farm.
Maintain it and the mechanic said I can go another 100k miles easy.
beats a car payment and insurance on a new vehicle!"
gmc,jimmy,2001,jjb99, 03/23/2011,NOt bad over the years,3,"I wanted to pass along my thoughts on this car. I had bought new and had the following replaced:
Ball joints, intake manifold gasket, door hinges.

That said, until now I have not had many issues other than fuel economy. The doors have awful hinges that are not adjustable. If they are used a lot, they fail and need to be drilled out and re-bushed. Terrible design. 

Lastly, I am now in the looking for another SUV because the Jimmy needed a Crankshaft Sensor replaced because of fouling caused by the intake coolant leak. Well it needed a computer ""reset"" to fix the erratic engine and now I think we killed the motor. Oh well, 160,000 not bad."
gmc,jimmy,2001,collegekid20, 09/15/2011,good vehicle,3,"my jimmys a 2001 that i received as my first vehicle a couple of years ago i put around 20,000 miles on it myself and its still below 100,000 miles and it runs amazing the only major problems ive had so far is my brake calipers seized up which is my fault for letting it sit too long, my spedometer doesnt work quite correctly and my fuel sensor is a little dirty but other then that i beat the crap out of it especially in winter and it still runs amazing, but if you dont keep up with it maintence wise then yea youll have problems, but thats with all vehicles"
gmc,jimmy,2001,Pat S., 11/10/2010,Good Vehicle,4,"I bought my 2001 GMC Jimmy SLS used in 2004.  It was a dealer buy-back because of electrical problems.  I have 118,000 miles on it with no serious mechanical repairs.  Yes, it has needed brakes, but that's normal.  Had a serious vibration problem which was found to be missing washers in the hood hinges.  A cheap repair and it's quiet.  I like this vehicle a lot.  My only regret is that it isn't 4 wheel drive.  "
gmc,jimmy,2001,MK, 10/29/2009,stop replacing ball joints!!!,4,"Seeing all the other reviews and my own experience (GM Tech)  DO NOT replace ball joints on this vehilce.  GM specs allow for ALOT of 'play"" or movement and 95% of independent shops will tell you you need ball joints replaced when you do not. If you think you need them or are told by a mechanic, take veh to a GM dealership and have them  check and compare to allowed specifications. Most Jimmys and Blazers can go 150,000 miles + without needing replacement of ball joints!"
gmc,jimmy,2001,jimbo4x4, 12/24/2012,TLC goes a long way.,4,"I've had my GMC Jimmy for about 6 months.
When I bought it the trans was rebuilt the oil cooler lines and the coolant was just flushed.
Me and my Jimmy had a rocky relationship at first, I had to replace intake gasket, fuel pump, front hubs, and some other more minor things.
But now that I gave my Jimmy some TLC it is a great workhorse.
It has a strong engine, it can tow a trailer sufficient for my needs, and I can fit all my tools in the back.
The four wheel drive is excellent. I'm 6""3 and can sit comfortably in the drivers seat. .
I change my oil regularly and take care of any maintenance right away.
Its a great SUV.
Take care of your car and it will take care of you!"
gmc,jimmy,2001,missle711, 09/06/2009,Are you kidding me!,2,"Wow, and I thought I was the only person who absolutely hates this SUV! Single mom trying to make it and this suv keeps putting me further in the whole. When my transmission went out the repair shop told me they replace at least two or more of these models of transmissions every week. They recommend that you buy a new transmission and have it rebuilt. Yeah $1500.00 and 1 1/2 years later the transmission is just about shot again. I have replaced almost all front end parts 2-3 times (yes, the same parts) I was told after buying it that it is a high maintenance suv. Wish someone would have told me that before I bought it...lol ABS/brake lights stay on wipers always break I could go on for days"
gmc,jimmy,2001,Chris, 12/02/2009,No complaints,3,"We bought our SLE 4x4 new off the lot and still own it.  Its had it's share of leaks and general wear and tear but overall has been a good vehicle.  Got about 110,000 miles and most of the leaks and issues started after 100k. It's been babied the whole time, always parked inside and oil changed regularly.  Gets around great in the snow and used it to tow quite a bit of stuff (doesn't do real well at highway speeds with the AC running).  We've been happy with it and the wife is still using it as her daily driver.  Mileage ranges anywhere from 15-20."
gmc,jimmy,2001,Tom from jersey , 10/10/2019,Vehicle for mechanically incline,4,I'd give this suv a 4.5 star in satisfaction. Here's the deal honestly it's a fairly reliable vehicle if you take care of it. I find parts are extremely well priced as long as you can do the repairs yourself it's a excellent purchase. For me I bought my 2001 gmc jimmy SLE 4wd from a coworker for $300 he was fed up with the vehicle. It had about 152k on it at the time. After a complete refit of the tune of about $2200 the truck is perfect. I now have around 226k and have not had a single issue other than normal wear n tear. Personally I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone who knows there way around a vehicle and needs a reliable vehicle to get back n forth to work. Had vehicle for 4 yrs and never let me down. After market is the way to go on parts with lifetime warranty. I love this vehicle 4.3 vortec is definitely a work horse just fix the intake and spider injection right off the bat and your good for yrs. Highly recommend 
gmc,jimmy,2001,Peter, 10/05/2009,From one problem to next,2,"Bought it new. Replaced water pump, many bearings, idler, pitman arms, every kind of leak possible due to Dex- cool GM problem and had problems with 4x4. At least the body has held up over the years."
gmc,jimmy,2001,margaret, 03/14/2010,2001 gmc jimmy,3,"When I first got this Jimmy it was great. now within the last 4 yrs I have put in 5 fuel pumps plus other parts but I understand the wear and tear other parts but five fuel pumps. I put two fuel pumps in the last two years. Maybe I will get lucky and gm will bail me out with some help to purchase a fuel pump which I desperately need with this economy. I really need a bail out like gm got.

Heavy 4wd vehicles are though right.  I'm loyal to this SUV though the worries tell me never to buy another and possibly never another GMC. From a rebuilt transmission, gasket replacement, bearings, and water leaks plus alignments? How should i feel?"
gmc,jimmy,2001,Kat, 09/17/2010,"3 transmissions, and 3 fuel pumps",2,"Hi I bought it used.  Now have 191,000 and if you throw enough money at something it will keep running,  This is the only vehicle I have ever had to have towed 7 times and I have been driving over 40 years.  AAA is a must if you drive one of these. The body still looks great. Now there is something major going on with the front end.  Afraid to take it to the mechanic. This is the third transmission, one radiator, fuel pump has been replaced 3 times.  The starter, brakes and rotors several times.  The 4 wheel drive and a/c works perfectly have not had to do anything with either too bad the whole car wasn't like these components. "

I get around 18 MPG city and 22 highway and I love to hit the gas. The biggest problem I had, was needing new tires at 28,000 miles. Was told that it helps keep the cost down to build them. This is a great SUV and will keep it for a long time.  "

gmc,jimmy,2001,Umper, 03/08/2010,Very Disappointing,2,"My wife and I purchased this vehicle brand new. Loved the car; had wonderful amenities. SLT with heated leather seats, moonroof, onstar, the works. We've performed all of the scheduled maintenance. It's been garage kept for its entire life and driven less than 10 miles a day with the occasional trip out of town. Drove great UNTIL the warranty expired. Ever since then $$$. Heater stopped working. We've poured over $3500 into it and it still won't blow hot. The GM mechanic had the nerve to come show my wife how to ""properly"" turn the heat on. What a jerk; never buying GM again. Too many problems to list. Can't wait until its gone. This was a $35,000 piece of crap. No wonder GM needed a bailout."
gmc,jimmy,2001,ed smithle, 01/07/2003,Wasted Money,2,"This suv is a waste of money.  I haved 
nothing but problems.  Buying GMC, I 
thought I was better off than Chevy.  
That was a lie.  All I bought was a 
expensive hunk of junk.  From pins in 
the door squeaking to terrible gas 
mileage and Gmc customer service and 
dealerships that give poor service to 
you.  In summary look at something 
different.  I've owned this suv for two 
years and want everyone not to have the 
same problems as me.  I diffinately 
would recommend something else."
gmc,jimmy,2001,Al, 06/27/2008,Impressive ride,4,"Excellent vehicle for an outdoors type of guy. Handles well for the most part, leans a bit at high speeds in curves. The vehicle at times had a raddle in the rear, although not annoying.  Gas mileage is typical for a SUV, not a Geo metro. If you are buying a SUV, isn't for the hybrid driver. Go out and buy this vehicle, mine has close to 100,000 miles and will make it to 200,000 miles!"
gmc,jimmy,2001,Phil, 09/06/2008,I hate my car,3,"I have had this vehicle for 2 years now. It has 113,000 miles.  Replaced the ball joints 4 times and they need it again after just replacing the fuel pump at $900. I have probably spent at least $4000 on just repairing this vehicle. The 4 wheel drive switch went wacko. Now the brake lights are on and staying on.  Fuel economy is rotten. This car has been in a repair garage more than it's been in my garage. I'll definitely not buy another GMC product again."
gmc,jimmy,2001,The Jimmy, 09/13/2008,Wouldn't buy again,2,"I have had my Jimmy for about 4 years now and I have had some basic problems check engine lights on and no one can figure out why, blew a head gas get. I have been good to it always get oil changed on time. It feels like the car is made of plastic and it makes terrible noises when you drive. I guess all in all it been OK to me. Also terrible gas mileage I don't even want to check and see what it is now with gas $4"
gmc,jimmy,2001,senseiccol, 11/14/2008,Expensive to maintain,2,"I've had to replace the alternator 3 times, the battery 2 times, both of the front ball joints As well as the idle arm have gone out, and the electrical system is junk. The door hinges and pins have gone out. I have also had to replace the fuses a couple of times. It stinks on gas. Nothing lasts very long on this SUV, and as soon as you fix one thing another thing goes out on you. Don't buy a Jimmy! Unless you like spending money on the same thing part again and again. "
gmc,jimmy,2001,applered, 11/14/2008,Security Stinks,3,"I bought my 2001 Jimmy in July 2007, it was a used Jimmy. It has a good engine has always started but the security systems stinks. We drove the Jimmy a week after we bought it to Georgia. We get to Chatanoga TN and we started having problems with the Jimmy stopping and the security light coming on. We get back to Indiana where we live and the horns start going off and lights flashing in the middle of the night.  We stop at a gas station shut the engine off, put in gas, pay for gas, get back in the Jimmy start it up and the security light comes on and we can't move.  Now over a year later, the Jimmy runs but only for about 10 minutes and shuts off, won't run. Trading off as soon as I can."
gmc,jimmy,2001,ex-GMC'ers, 12/16/2008,Never again!,2,"This was the worst choice we ever made! Things replaced: transmission module, overhead compass/temp, ignition switch, turn signal levers, oil cooler lines x3, door hinge pins, heater door, 4x4 buttons and front wheel bearings. Items with issues: transfer case removed d/t shifting fork lever sticking, transmission sun gear out, jack cover falls off constantly and speakers are crap. Depreciation is terrible. Definitely learned something from this purchase. Research, research, research. I wonder why GM is needing a bail out when they built crap like this but, attached a $31,000 price tag? Definitely expected more bang for our buck! If you're mechanically enclined this is a great vehicle to disolve your time on. Looks good on jack stands."
gmc,jimmy,2001,miladyelaine, 12/23/2008,Here we go,3,"Well, I must have gotten a GMC super lemon. I picked it up with 10 k miles and thought I was in heaven. But the the honeymoon didn't last long. After 30k, we had replaced both front hubs and the 4wd decoder motor. After 60k, another set of hubs.  90k, transmission, fuel pump, and serp. belt at least twice a year. Two days ago, the fuel pump went again.  By the way, make sure you change the engine coolant on mfr's schedule, or you are in for a nightmare! Great ride but this vehicle will dip deep into your pockets. The only guarantee on this car is that every trip to the garage is going to cost you at least $1,000, and you can bank on four to six trips per year. "
gmc,jimmy,2001,Randy, 12/29/2008,Good luck,2,"I have always had good luck with my GM cars and trucks. Not sure if I got a lemon or what. I bought the Jimmy for my wife. In the past 6 months I have replaced the rear end, followed the next month by the transmission and two weeks later a fuel pump. Needless to say none of it was cheap. The door locks have stopped working. The driver's side window sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Now you have to turn the key on and off twice to get it to start. The Jimmy has pretty much been a disappointment and a money pit. I could understand if the car was driven hard but we live in the city. It's used to pick up the kids and in town use."
gmc,jimmy,2001,cjammerman, 01/08/2009,"Engine Reliable, other parts unreliable",3,"Engine still running strong at 124,500 miles, but I have gone through front end parts like crazy. 6 wheel hubs, ball joints replaced twice. Fuel pressure sensor and purge valve went out.  It has been in the shop a lot for suspension/front end parts and wheel hubs are not cheap. I also have issues with the car shaking/shimmy-ing at low speeds/reverse when in 4WD.  Read an information bulletin that there have been complaints on this problem but no recalls."
gmc,jimmy,2001,K.P., 01/23/2009,Nice Vehicle,4,"We bought this Vehicle in 2007, because of the design other amenitites it came with. It only had 49,000 miles on it when we bought it. It now has 81,000 miiles and it needs lower ball joints, seals on the motor cause it leaks bad and other minor stuff. We keep the oil changed regularly. Now, we don't drive it at all. When we bought it, it still had a warranty and I took it back to be fixed, of course the warranty doesn't cover any of the things wrong with it. I would like to trade it. I won't buy another one. It has heated seats on both driver and passenger side in the front and memory seats on the driver side. Both of these options were what sold us on it,including leather and other options"
gmc,jimmy,2001,vince_27, 03/09/2009,Junk,2,Never buy a 99 GMC Jimmy 2 Door 4.3L Sport. They are Junk! I had to put a new trans in it $1500. Plus upper and lower ball joins on both sides $426. They heater dont work. Also the rear end needs to be rebuild $700. The pinion bearings and gears are bad. Make lots of humming noise when your going down the road and let off the gas.

I've repalced in the five years owned the water pump, breaks, rotars, Thermostat, wheel bearings, tires, a/c condensor, fuel pump, alternator, fuel gauge & battery. It has over 130,000. miles on it and runs great. With the money I've put into  it I feel like I have a whole new suv. What else could go wrong? I love my Jimmy! Comfort and ease. Love all the little gadgets and stereo system on the steering wheel. Bose stereo! Excellent system.  "
gmc,jimmy,2001,Amadeus, 06/12/2009,Clanker,2,It looks nice but the fuel economy is bad and the constants check ups makes it no realiable.  The heater core failed and I had engine coolant steam inside the cabin and to fork out $$$ to repear. I wish I had not bought it.
gmc,jimmy,2001,Run Away, 06/12/2009,Total Junk,1,"This car has been nothing but one problem after another. Bought it for my wife to haul the kids around in but it seems like im working on it more than it runs. We have replaced rear end, month later the transmission went out, next the fuel pump quit, then the lock quit working, and now the thing wont start half of the time. Had it checked today and its the spider coil. It has been nothing but a money pit."

the Service dept 3 times in 14000 
miles. The first visit was for the 
service engine light being on since 5 
min out of the lot. The second visit 
was for the same thing a day after it 
was supposed to be fixed. The third 
visit was for a brake light recall and 
rear washer/wiper (washer did not 
work), speakers sound funny especially 
for Bose, and cd changer not turnung 
on, and last the security light coming 
on while car is running. All were fixed 
under warranty, but I had to rent a 
car. Also high depreciation."
gmc,jimmy,2001,jim, 08/01/2009,Worst reliable truck I ever owned,2,The truck was great looking. But broke down on a regular basis. Electronics and engine problems. Even the dealer was tired of fixing it! Finally traded it in for a more reliable truck . 
gmc,jimmy,2001,Lexmark, 01/09/2010,"Expensive to Drive/Radiator, Heat Proble",3,"Lot of problems with radiator, water pump, thermostat and heater coil because of red antifreeze damage. There were recalls by GMC on red antifreeze and law suites against GMC, but I bought used, did not know about this an the dealer of course never mentioned any problems.  Car was owned previously by a Doctor who could afford the extra maintenance. One month after purchase, It needed a water pump. It Needs a 120.00 radiator flush every 3 mo. or so to keep down rust build up in raditor. Red rust is so thick it looks like wet red clay dirt and clogs up the heater coil and water pump, heat won't work.  I would not recommend that anyone buy a car that uses red antifreeze. Don't walk, run away!"
gmc,jimmy,2001,Alex, 01/30/2010,"YES, THIS IS A PIECE OF TRASH",2,"Bought the car as a demo, less than 10k miles..., Nothing but problems...Had to bring it back to the dealer over 15 times prior to the warranty running out.  First it was Fuel Pump, Air Pump, and basically the whole engine... Then it started leaking oil out of the engine gasket.  All this when it was under 36,000 miles.   Total trash..... No more GMC for me.  No dealer want this piece of trash for a trade in.  You'd be lucky to get 1,000 for it....."

This truck has been absolutely nothing but a nightmare.  I've replaced the transmission $1800.  Drove it home to Michigan from sc and it actually died two blocks away from my in laws driveway. The plastic manifold is a joke it has melted twice with flames destroying gaskets so here goes another $400 in repairs. The driver side window works when it wants to, the gas Gage at 1/4 tank goes move up to 1/2 tank so you really never know how much gas you have in it.

something bigger than the Plymouth Breeze I had. 
I was disappointed. The front seats 
were smaller and cramped at the feet. 
The radio is not very good. The back seat not 
really made for three. However, it 
drove nicely. I liked the high ride and 
engine power it provides. It also is easy to park and 
hasd great visability.  It does feel like it leanes too 
much when going around curves though.  I'm not a big
fan of the exterior either.  I should have gotten an Envoy."
gmc,jimmy,2001,Robert Marks, 07/02/2005,Nice Small Truck,3,This truck never failed to start. Gas mileage was not the greatest but there is lots of room especially with the back seats laid flat.
gmc,jimmy,2001,capelt, 01/26/2006,Good workhorse,4,"I have been exceedingly satisfied with my Jimmy, having pushed it a bit further than most city dwellers might. It has hauled heavy loads cross-country more than once, and has performed almost as well as a full size truck (and coming from a ranching family, I know trucks). I have been a little disappointed at some of the electrical problems with the gauges. That said, I enjoy driving this truck very much, and it has responded well to every curve I've thrown it, from rural snow drifts in Maryland, to rocky ranchland in central Texas. It's not a glamorous vehicle, but it's a workhorse in true GMC fashion, and I plan to keep my truck for a long time to come."
gmc,jimmy,2001,Love it!, 10/08/2007,"Fun to drive, easy to handle",4,"This is the second Jimmy SLT 4x4 that I have owned.

It now has over 100,500 miles on it. Now the brake light warning stays on, and the ignition switch is going out. I think that's what it is. Other than that, I love it. It is easy to drive, great sound system, comfy seats with dual seat warmers."
gmc,jimmy,2001,jimmy drivin woolley, 11/03/2007,Just what I expected,4,"All the repairs I have read in this forum about the Jimmy are typical! Don't whine about it! The Jimmy is a heavy truck! Replacing wheel bearings/hub assembly is normal.  Gas mileage isn't the best, but the Jimmy is an SUV not a Ford Pinto.  Every vehicle has pros and cons, things don't last forever! I service my own vehicles, If you are car savy, I recomend this vehicle as you can probably do most the maintainance and repairs yourself. The only bad experience i've had is paying a dealer $900.00 to replace the fuel pump.  Take care of this SUV and it will take care of you.  If you had a bad experience, I'm sorry.

All in all...a true winner.  The excellent 4wd, powerful v6, high ground clearance, and sporty suspension makes for a great driving experience offroad or on."

over 2 years, and it's still a great 
family vehicle.  It has all the 
features you'd ever want, and the 
build quality is excellent.  It rides 
well and handles well in all weather 
conditions.  In all, an excellent 
vehicle."
gmc,jimmy,2001,Sheena, 03/07/2008,Fun and Nice to Look at but a Black Hole,3,I like the GMC Jimmy just fine. I am am not big on fixing my own cars personaly though but I love fun & tough cars and SUVs. The GMC Jimmy is tough and reliable to a point. Yes basic maintenance is required most definitly but wear and tear and a bit of cheap parts make that go a little more quickly than one can keep up with. Money is definitely needed to own this car because big items do go on it and sometimes all at once. 
gmc,jimmy,2001,Tom, 03/19/2008,Worst buy,2,"Worst purchase I've ever made.  Never better than 12 MPG on highway.  Very little support from untrustworthy dealership.  Required front ball joints at 60,000 miles because ""southern hospital"" mechanics failed to lubricate chassi properly and dealership refused to fix. No room in vehicle back seats.  Have back seat belts for three, can only fit 2 people.  Transmission gone at 140,000.  NEVER ANOTHER GMC PRODUCT"
gmc,jimmy,2001,ramdaddi, 12/11/2007,better have a second car!!,2,"you will need a second car while this one is in the shop!!  bumper to bumper, this ride was designed by a bunch of engineers who see cheech and chong as THEIR role models!!  i thank God that i purchased an extended warranty, or i would easily be out over ten grand! the service engine light keeps me company.  finally went off with a new injector pump in mid summer, but now it is back!!  EXTENDED WARRANTY!!"
gmc,safari,2000,pacey, 05/10/2005,Not too bad!,4,"This is our 1st van.  It is comfortable, handles well and easily sits 7 average sized adults.  The rear AC is a must in south Florida.  We use it to tote scuba divers and their gear as well as a personal vehicle.  Some of the interior features need to be beefed up to stand normal wear and tear--The hand grip on the pax side dash-the covers on the hinges of the rear seats-the vent covers on the rear AC outlets and the covers on the seatbelt floor attachments."

gmc,safari,2000,minneapolismarc, 03/31/2007,Best mileage for a vehicle this size,4,No vehicle that can tow 6000 pounds gets better MPG than this van. I bought the 2 wheel (not AWD) version for the mileage. I drive 75 on the freeway with the cruise on and with the city stop and go I get 19.5 mpg on every tank. Less of course if I tow my boat. I work as a mechanic and did not even bother to inspect the van for more than 10 minutes as the original owner had the maint. paperwork. The only things I have had to do is replace the metal strip that holds on the lower trim between the front and rear wheels cost $125. Plastic line cracked under the hood for heater fan selector- free fix and common problem. Oil cooler lines seep but who cares it is common + cheap fix if you do.
gmc,safari,2000,Nate, 08/09/2008,Great All Wheel Drive Van,4,Bought for dog shows. Removed third row and put in my crates. Enough room for 4 people (Captain chairs) and all our stuff for dog shows. Very comfortable to drive and ride in. Must have all wheel drive if you live where there is snow. Gas mileage 15 to 17 in city and 20 to 22 on hwy and 18.9 average. Plan to drive it to the wheels fall off literally. 
gmc,safari,2000,Devo, 01/09/2010,I'll be sad to see it go,4,"And here I promised myself I wouldn't get attached to this vehicle! We bought it less than 4 years ago when we were expecting our 5th child, knowing we would likely outgrow it in a few years. But I LOVE this van. The battery & alternator have been replaced since we bought it. Otherwise, nothing but regular maintenance. After our 1998 F-150, some of the peripherals like door handles, locks, seatbelt guides feel a bit ""cheap"" (lighter weight plastic, a few rattles), but it's still holding up fine at 150k. We are now expecting our 7th child so will be moving on to a 15 passenger."
gmc,safari,2000,Paul adams, 03/25/2019,What a mini van should be,4,"The only downside to this van is the poor quality of the interior trim components very flimsy for my likes and the short step to the running boards can prove tricky
"
gmc,safari,2000,Mike, 04/19/2005,"I'm happy, great AWD.",3,I bought the van with 47k and have 65k now. Other than the alternator and a gear position sensor that was sending power to the starter when the van was running($50 part and an easy fix!) It has been very good to me. Went to FL with 3 adults and 3 kids in July and having rear A/C and rear bucket seats is nice. Also has a roof mounted TV with a VCR. The AWD works awesome. If you drive in snow don't get one without it! 
gmc,safari,2000,Pame, 12/02/2003,Loving My 3rd Safari!,4,"Since 1992 we have owned 1 used and 2

gmc,safari,2000,Darren, 09/02/2005,Lots of room and a good tow vehicle,3,"We bought the van new and had it for 5 years.  It always had enough power and plenty of room for our family of 5.  We camp a lot and tow a boat. It did have an annoying habit of little things breaking.  Power window motors, power seat motors, etc.  Also, being so big, expect to spend alot more than the average amount on brakes and shocks.  Overall, expensive in gas and maintenance but always big and powerfun enough."
gmc,safari,2000,L Mummau, 06/17/2003,Good Van,3,"Bought New as leftover, had minor

Not so.  Had transmissions at 8500 mi. 
and at 22000 mi.  A/C compressor has 
been replaced at 5000 mi.  Engine has a 
random stumble and sometimes dies, but 
dealer cannot duplicate and repair.  
The exhaust tone in the rear of the van 
is obnoxious.  I also find the 
drivability of the drive train less 
than it should be."

and spend very little time in the 
repair shop.maintenance costs are super 
low if you stay away from the awd. i 
purchased an extended warranty but i 
know I'll rarely use it. as long as you 
understand its a dinosaur to drive 
around town pot holes. also note that 
it is a durable ""truck"" that can get to 
be a handful when the fuel tank gets 
close to one quarter full when the 
pavement is wet. adding weight during 
the winter with the correct truck type 
tires will keep you unstuck. the engine 
power could be stronger, but the smooth 
power band and not too stiff suspension 
makes it pretty effortless to drive. "

second Safari van.  Now if they would 
have power door openers for the side

This is my second I purchased the first on brand new in 1990 with a high top, swivel seats, TV, VCR... after 156,000 miles I bought a 2001 in 2002 and still have it today. It has 163,000 miles and still going.  I'm 6'-8"" tall and 360 lbs.  The van is a work horse. I fit like a glove It has gone to Florida and all parts northeast.  I used it to move my tools and merchandise in both of my businesses. Why oh Why did they stop making this creature of love!!! I will miss you and will with all my heart try to keep what I have for as long as it will run.  I have replaced many components, but that OK I want to keep it for a long time.

gmc,safari,2001,Happy Safari Owner, 08/26/2010,I LOVE my Safari!,4,"I have nothing but good things to say about this van.  Maybe I just got lucky with my particular vehicle, but I have had to put nothing but tires on this thing!  I bought this 2001 SLE in April of 2009 and it had 120K miles already, so I brought it by my mechanic's shop and it passed with flying colors.  It's now over a year and 25K miles later, and I had to put tires on it.  Runs strong with 145K miles, no smoke, plenty of power, handles wonderfully, very comfortable for my bad back with 4 herniated discs, and I use it almost every weekend to haul a large amount of musical gear to the stage.  I really don't understand why they are disc'd, but a 2011 or 2012 return would be VERY SMART!"

gmc,safari,2001,Joe V., 08/23/2005,"Versatile, But Unreliable",2,"The Safari is arguably the most versatile vehicle on the market. No other vehicle can carry cargo, 8 passengers and occasionally tow a trailer. I did all of the above with my Safari and it was great.  Unfortunately, the Safari was not as reliable as I expected. During the 4 years I owned it, I had to replace the transmission, power lock actuators, vacuum diaphram, rear heat control, dashboard switches, mass air flow sensor, exhaust system and give it a complete tune-up.  I also had the interior carpet replaced along with the weatherstripping because water leaked in from the dutch doors. I was so disappointed in the quality of the Safari that i traded it in and bought a 2005 Ford E-150"

gmc,safari,2001,Ron Snopek, 06/27/2017,"Quite the vehicle in its prime! Up to 100,000?",2,"It has an excellent transmission! Maybe someone else replaced it. I paid $5000@108,000 miles for my Safari in 2012 and in 5 years and 32,000 miles it has nickeled and dimed me for $9,570 total in repairs (of the receipts that I kept) not including oil changes. 8 times I was towed and misspent $1,175 of that total for tune-ups, sensors, distributer caps, etc. when it turned out to be a loose wire in a harness, which needed to be replaced, of course.  Those repair guys loved me. I had to replace the head gasket, fuel pump, rear differential swap-out, brakes (twice), oil cooler lines, power steering hoses, ABS module, the door handle broke off, mufflers, exhaust system and cat converter, front sway bar and links, EGR valve, and the windshield leaked so I bought a new one--that was a minor expense. Now my '01 Safari has a bad ABS wheel sensor and the dome light defeat button is shorting out. The vehicle is worth $1,500 after I have the wheel sensor replaced.  It burns no smoke, however, and has 190hp@only 4,400rpm and 250lbs of torque @ only 2800rpm. Mine sat 7 people a few times. It's junk!

The truck based Safari was the perfect answer and it has proven to be just that. After 108,000 miles, the only repair it has needed was a an alternator during the first year covered by warranty. Too bad there isn't a comparable vehicle available today. Guess I'll keep it. It's still strong and I expect at least 250,000 miles out of it."

a few minor problems. We had to 
replace brakes at 15,000 miles and GMC 
wouldn't cover it under warranty which 
made me angry and made me wonder what 
the warranty was for.I like the truck-
like sensation and this is no woss 
minivan. The ride is harsh over rough 
surfaces and it doesn't handle as well 
as car-based minivans. The interior is 
cheap plastic and poorly made. Even in

cargo room, even when traveling with a

GMC Safari. 

The Safari does it all and does it 
well.  It has more cargo room than a 
Ford Expedition and a Chevy Surburban 
and it was $12,000+ cheaper than either 
of the two.  The only options I did NOT

It is quiet, smooth riding, seats are GREAT but could use better leg room in the front Captain seats.  Also My legs are shorter so I would like the gas pedal up higher. some times I use my tippy toes to reach the gas pedal. but in order to have leg room, I have to have my driver seat back as far as it goes.

We had to pick them up and bring them to the camp site. You can drive it anywhere and carry 6 adults and luggage and shopping back from the road trips. Just finished trip down to have upgraded brakes to cross drilled vented front vented rear. Really stops now. Looking for new tires next. Only 65k on the van so will be around for awhile. "

minivans.
Bad: Interior quality, fuel economy, 
rattling, reliability, stiff ride, no 
driver side sliding door.
GMC/Chevy should offer a optional v8

shows dogs and a standard mini-van was 
too small and she didn't want a full 
size van.  She has found the Safari to 
be just right.  Have over 150,000 
miles on our first one with virtually 
no problems - most reliable vehicle 
we've ever had (yes, we had a Toyota 
and a Nissan...not bad vehicles but 
not Nirvana either).  One additional 
note, the Safari gets surprisingly 
good mileage."
gmc,safari,2004,GWD, 03/19/2004,safari,4,"low upkeep costs. parts are cheep, alot
of cargo room, good head and body room.
Can fit two adults and car seat in same
row and still have moving around room,
no other mid-sized van has that. 8
passenger spaces with luggage for 8
people inside the van. Can fit 8' 2x4 on
floor and 10'
on top of dash with all doors closed.
4'x8' plywood fits inside with doors closed."
gmc,safari,2004,msterk, 12/10/2003,2nd one I've owned,4,"This is my 2nd Safari.  My husband is 
driving the other one now.  It's a 1996 
and I liked it so much I bought another 
one.

It's all wheel drive and available 
cargo space gives it more bang for the 
buck compared to other mini vans or 
suv's when price does matter."
gmc,safari,2004,Michael Deveroux, 09/27/2003,Not Worth the Money,2,"The GMC Safari is no bargain for your 
money. Its ""old - school"" exterior 
design has people guessing whether your 
driving a brand new van. In fact they 
have made very little exterior changes 
to the Safari/Astro van since 1996. Its 
clunky and boxy style adds to 
increased ""top heavyness"" when driving 
in windy conditions. The interior of 
the Safari is almost as bland as the 
exterior. With the bare minimum 
avaliable in features, again, makes you 
feel like your driving a 1996 Safari 
van rather than a 2003-04. One of the 
only high points that I have found this 
van to have is above average interior-
space. "

gmc,safari,2005,PoppaRick, 07/25/2005,Practical good Van,4,"The Safari is a good practical van with AWD capabilities.Not fancy, but able to handle three kids and their sports stuff plus friends. Snow, and spring mud are not enough to stop it delivering service to our family."
gmc,safari,2005,BCA, 08/27/2004,Safari Review,3,"If you want to carry six people with 
AWD this is the ticket.  This is the 
second Safari we've owned.  While the 
interior could use some work such as 
larger front leg room, driver side 
passenger doors and a few more 
cupholders, the overall functionality 
of the van is excellent.  The larger 
size more than makes up for these 
shortcomings.  It is great for long 
(800 mile) road trips with 4 kids.  Not 
only that, it can carry all the gear.  
The AWD works great in snow and the 4.3 
L V-6 has sufficient power.  We've had 
no major mechanical problems with this 
van or its predecessor.  However, there 
have been some interior trim issues.
   "
gmc,safari,2005,Karl, 09/03/2007,USA Travler,4,"The Safari is the best van on the market. I can't imagine 2005 being the last.  It is extreem comfort and space in travel. It will carry an elephant with ease!  This is my second Safari. If they were still sold I would not consider any other vehicle.  The previous one I had for 223,000 miles, got 28 - yes - 28 miles to the gallon (tbs fuel injection)With steel bumpers it was a tank with zip and personality. Nothing in the mileage other than tires and brakes ever needed replacement!  My new 2005 is somewhat more refined in interior - but I feel that negative as space was removed.  It gets far less milage. My only serious fault is that the sterring radious is very slight."

Pros: Save thousands and all the bugs are worked out. Cons: You don't have the latest (not always the greatest). Thus far, the Sierra has really surprised me. The comfort of this truck is amazing. This is one of the quietest vehicles I have owned. Quieter than my Camry's, Nissan's,and Honda's. And it's a truck? "
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,DOUG, 11/11/2006,Sierra 1500,4,"The overall quality of this heavily discounted truck is finally approaching the Asian level. Fit is rather OK, but the finish is excellent, both inside and out. Engine is very quiet, smooth, and the power is more than adequate. A/C is superb, and the full compliment of gauges is quite welcomed. EPA shows 16/21 and thus far I'm realizing close to that. Have always had 4WD trucks for useless reasons, and the difference in 2WD ride quality/mileage is astounding.  I would recommend opting for the locking rear axle though, as the low end torque placed on the standard axle simply overwhelms the drive tire in certain situations. So far this very handy vehicle is all and more than advertised."
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,2007 SLT SIERRA, 06/21/2008,Great truck for families,5,"MY husband bought this truck for me. We have three kids, and it fits everyone comfortably. They are kept busy with the DVD system and separate entertainment system."

I have a 2x4 but didn't get stuck in our large snow storm so with good tread depth it isn't too bad. I bought it for work but know I just use it to commute. I am glad I like it because truck/SUV market is in the dumps. At least my truck is a V6 so it gets about 16 city 20 freeway.
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,Steve, 08/11/2008,I really like this truck,4,"I have made four trips from Houston TX to the DC area, a trip to the mountains (off-road) in Colarado, as well as my daily commute. This truck rides and drives great with a comfortable cab. The 5.3 liter V8 provides the power I want without losing the MPG of a larger engine. Could it be improved, sure.  Probably has in the newer model. I would add storage capacity in-cab, as well as more functionality for cup holders and the like. I consistently get 15 MPG in town, and 20 MPG on the road. Who would not want more? But that's probably as good as any full size truck.  Would I buy again?  You bet."
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,wreckerman9, 04/09/2009,i like mine,4," So far I'm satisfied with the ride, handling, comfort, and dependability. The mpg Is awesome, as I'm getting 25+ hwy, and 23 around town, with the v-6,4. 3l,  I recently went thru 6 states, to see a sick family member, and the long range fuel mileage was great. The trucks seems to be well worth the price I paid, and I've had no problems in 2 years. "

Only options are cruise, A/C and Limited Slip Differential.  After over two and a half years and 34,000 miles I couldn't be much happier.  I have yet to have a single problem with it.  It has a lot of utility, ride is smooth and it's quiet for a truck - and more comfortable than any car I've driven or ridden in.  Fit and finish is outstanding.  Ergonomics are excellent Highly recommended"

gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,George J. Murphyi, 02/12/2010,Can't beat it at 40 below,4,"I have had a lot of trucks, Dodges, Chevy's etc. This truck has never disappointed me. First year I had it I took off down the Alcan to Minnisota to pick up a camper trailer. I towed it to Seattle, and then back to Fairbanks, AK, where I live. This was in January, and all the winter frills to go with the trip.It didn't miss a beat, and when it is -40 I just heat the remote start, and warm it up. The auto 4WD is a great feature, especially here where it is slick from time time. I've been eye balling the Terrain but my wife hid the checkbook, says my GMC Cadillac in disguise is enough."
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,Stokes, 12/19/2006,Sierra 1500,4,This is my first GMC and it seems to be a very well built truck. Very spacious interior and inst.panel layed out well. Smooth ride and very quiet. Have not pulled a trailer as yet but power seems to there if needed. 
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,uc_husky, 06/15/2007,Awesome truck,4,"This is a great truck with a comfortable interior and an impressively smooth ride and quiet engine. The Z71 package helps on the bumps. The engine is powerful, sometimes it feels like I'm driving a large sedan with the acceleration and braking.Back seat in extended cab is acceptable. Awesome truck for the price (cheaper than the new styles)."
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,Howard, 10/16/2007,207 GMC 1500,4,"I puchased this GMC for the ride. I had a HD 2500 Diesel before. Bad back! I really like this truck, not just for the ride but for all the things it brings to the table. This truck is really loaded, leather,auto wipers, memory seats, adjustable brake/gas peddles, etc. The ride is wonderful! Very comfortable!"

 My GMC has never broken down and has never left me stranded. it's not the fastest truck I've ever owned but it pulls anything I wanted to and does it well.
"
gmc,sierra-1500-classic,2007,Brad, 03/06/2019,Good Truck that serves my needs,4,"My truck is an SLT with a 6.0 V8 that feels like it could move a mountain.   I pull a 20 ft enclosed trailer with it and you would not know it was behind you.    The only real issue I have had was with rear tail light assemblies and both were replaced twice under warranty and the last time they had a design change that has held up another 6 years.   Fuel mileage leaves a bit to be desired but it averages about 14 when not pulling the trailer, in stop and go traffic.     My truck is 11 years old and I still enjoy driving it.    I did upgrade the electronics, added a backup camera and covered the bed with a camper shell.    It is garage kept and when clean, still looks like new.

gmc,sierra-1500-hybrid,2009,Cali, 08/29/2009,Welcome Addition Update,4,"Just a quick update on my previous review.  First, my problems with dis- engaging brakes and abrupt transmission shifts have been solved.  The dealer where my Sierra Hybrid was sourced neglected to update my software.  Updating software fixed the brake problem and a faulty transmission pump fixed the gear shifting problem.  My Sierra now drives just like a standard Sierra and I'm a huge fan and I can confidently say that I would absolutely recommend this truck."
gmc,sierra-1500-hybrid,2009,Cali, 08/14/2009,I Welcome Addition,4,"I recently purchased a 2009 Sierra Hybrid, 2WD truck.  My initial impression is that this is a great vehicle.  I have all of the standard features of a Sierra with gas mileage averaging 21 MPG combined City/Highway.  Outstanding!  Contrary to Expert reviews, I would not agree with assessments that transitions shifts between electric and gas as seamless.  On the contrary, these transitions can be felt-- abruptly in some instances.  I also have concerns regarding the transition between regenerative and hydraulic brakes.  In some instances, my brakes have actually disengaged momentarily making me feel as though I might roll into the vehicle in front of me.  A very uncomfortable feeling.  "
gmc,sierra-1500-hybrid,2009,Melvin Brandstetter, 01/23/2010,Great Truck,4,"Cruise control doesn't work well if at all down hill. Tried Asking GM customer service VIA the phone about it. But the problem with this is, they just do not know and try to read the owners manual to you,  Their is no information on how it works or even if it works in the owners manual. They are providing this support from their centers around  World.. (One insisted Hydromantic meant Hybrid transmission). My Dodge manual - states clearly + or - 2 MPH down hill. I took it in to my dealer and said it doesnt hold on any hill I drive (unlike all my other vehicles. They said they can't fix it as their GM Tec paper states it may work or it may not, depending on the hill, and to down shift. "
gmc,sierra-1500-hybrid,2010,Jeff, 08/09/2010,I love this truck,5,"I tried a small car and it just doesn't work for me.  I wanted a big truck with the best mileage I could get and the Sierra Hybrid delivers big time!  I am averaging between 20 - 21.5 MPG in the city and about the same on the highway.  I have taken the family to the beach twice and it handles deep sand with no problems at all.  The kids love all the room in the back seat.  It is fun to drive.  Drives really well on the interstate, plenty of power.  Don't let the hybrid fool you.  Had the vehicle for 3 months now and would buy it again today."
gmc,sierra-1500-hybrid,2010,eStaR, 04/01/2010,Better Than Critics Give Credit,5,"This is a surprisingly nice vehicle and the savvy negotiator can get a good deal, make a few add-ons and end up with a really nice truck with great gas mileage.  I am amazed at how quiet it can be and how real the improved gas mileage is.  I think that professional critics miss the fact that many people will be coming from older trucks and so any new truck today has a lot more to offer than trucks from days past.  This truck has a very solid and quiet feel to it while maintaining the versatility of a full size pickup.  They run e85 Fuel as well and in KS you can get a $750 credit if you use 500 GL in a year.  I am very impressed overall with this truck!"
gmc,sierra-1500-hybrid,2010,TxTruck, 07/24/2010,Sierra Hybrid 4WD 2010,5,"This is a great truck, we like it better all the time and would recommend it to anyone needing a truck for work and family.  Acceleration and ride are very good.  The 2010 model brakes have a linear response, gear changing and engine stopping/restarting are smooth and quick, and there are more cup holders and storage compartments.   After 6400 miles we had 20-22 mpg hwy (at pump), 20 mpg  mixed local driving, and 19 mpg city. Gas savings estimated to be $600/yr at $3/gal and 10K mi/yr. Subtracting out $2200 hybrid tax credit, savings would pay for the difference in price in 3 years.      Only one minor problem, a tire pressure sensor went out. Has an 8 year warranty on hybrid components."
gmc,sierra-1500hd,2001,lilred289, 01/16/2008,This is a perfect truck,4,This truck flat out rocks.  The 6.0 will do 0-60 in about 10 seconds out of the box and that is with or with- out pulling a 7000lb car trailer.  The AWD option is absoultly genious especially here in ND where it gets a little icy.  The interior is the most comfortable truck I have ever been in.  It is like driving a caddy with a box behind it.  For being almost a 3/4ton truck it out handles my little S-10 and it is almost effortless to drive.

gmc,sierra-1500hd,2001,Matt, 08/08/2005,Would buy it again,4,"I hope my next truck will be as good as this one!  I put about 20K per year on it, and pull a camper or a loaded utility trailer often.  The heated seats are great when it's cold, and the AC cools off the roomy cab quickly, even when it's 100 in the shade.  The factory tires are good, and I have replaced them about every 40K miles. Tranny is smooth, and this truck is MUCH quieter on the highway than my previous '95 GMC extended cab, with much less wind and road noise.  The six liter powerplant pulls easily, and hwy mpg is about 16-17. In Dallas traffic, I get about 13.  The back seat is so comfortable, that it is our preferred road trip vehicle."

Most all towing would be in the mountains. I have alway driven GM trucks, so I was already use to the body style and interior, both of which I love. However, this is my first GMC. Ride is good for a 3/4 ton, power was good, although I knew I could better it later. Has the typical piston slap of this era of Vortec engines, but has not caused any problems. I run Amsoil synthetic oil, I change the filter every 5000 and the oil every 10,000."

I'm averaging about 14.9 mpg.  On a 
long highway run it will go to 16mpg.  
I have had two minor issues fixed under 
warranty.  Exhaust resonance, and a 
steering wheel ""clunk"".  Both taken 
care of.  I have 3 boys and we all go 
camping a lot.  It hardly even knows it 
is pulling a camper and everyone has 
plenty of room.  Rear seat passengers 
have their own heat and a/c vents for 
comfort.  The ride smooths out once the

trips are a real pleasure."
gmc,sierra-1500hd,2002,keithcitty@sbcglobal, 12/24/2006,little ttrouble,4,I really only have one gripe about the best truck I've ever owned and that's this: GM will not recall a 6.0 for a oil pump seal that causes the oil to airiate and leaves the owner with the impression that there's a collapsed lifter. Anyone else hear that annoying ticking? Check the GM service records and you'll see that its a 300.00 fix/maybe kind of thing.

this truck, and I haven't regretted 
it.  At this point, I have 5200 miles.  
Ride is a bit more jittery than the 
Ford.  Power is excellent.  Fuel 
economy is 13 in town, 15 on highway, 
thought I don't feel it is completely 
broke in.  The truck feels very solid.  
I just performed my first oil change, 
it came at 5100 miles, as was indicated 
by the oil change light.  I had been 
checking the oil level religiously and 
it never required any additional oil 
from new to the first change.  Overall,

I think the Chevy/GMC 1500HD 6.0 4x4 QuadSteer was the greatest pick-up ever built.   My job requires travel, & it's a dream on long trips. Plus, it's fun to run Civics & Mustangs around town!  Testimonial: It pulled a 1 ton Dodge diesel towing a 65 hp tractor & implements on a gooseneck trailer, about 500 yards out of a muddy pasture in the pouring rain. It was buried to the axles. Even when I initially freed him he still couldn't move an inch. The owner said ""that 6.0 can tot the mail but"" His jaw dropped when I pulled him all the way to the road.

Smooth, quiet, comfortable ride with plenty of room for 6 people. Gas mileage is around 16 mpg in the city, which is about all I got from my Blazer on the highway, so comparitively speaking for it's size it gets pretty good gas mileage! Very powerful engine, good steering & control features. If your looking for a truck that has it all then test drive a GMC...kids can even watch tv with the optional DVD player but you would lose your 6th seat! A+ to GMC ."

While I appreciate it's [power and towing abilities i did not expect to take such a hit on fuel economy. I traded a 1500 with the 5.3 which was getting 22.7 at highway speeds.

gmc,sierra-2500,2000,Vince, 10/25/2015,Great truck for work or play,5,"I picked this up to replace a 1999 Dodge Ram 2500 V10.  I use my trucks for towing my toys and for getting to my hunting camp.  I bought the GMC used with very low (50K) miles and I received the service records. The previous owner had a few problems with the worst being the door handle. I have had no major problems.  Mine is the 3 door 2500 4x4. The interior is good with very comfortable seats.  The seats have some play in the tracks and I have a kit to fix it, but never got around to doing it so I'd rate that minor.  Gauges are great with tranny temp and steering is good.  4 wheel disk brakes are excellent.  HVAC works well and has not had any problems. Ride is above average.  Fuel economy is 15 -17 with the 3.73 gears.  The 4L80E transmission (TH400 descendant) is excellent and is heavy duty.  It has push-button 4x4 shifting.  Auto, high, and low.  You can from high to low on the fly, and to low below 5 MPH.  Auto works well on wet roads.  My 4x4 shifter has not malfunctioned. Mine has the rear locking differential and gets through sand very well compared with the Dodge.  This truck has a nice off-road feel and feels very capable  The 6.0L LQ4 engine does make the piston slapping sound at start-up, but goes away when warm as designed.  Engine makes good power, but power is a bit too high in the RPM range for serious work with the 3.73 gears.  This model uses the power steering pump to boost the brakes and my unit had a bit of a leak.  Flushing the power steering unit with Prestone anti leak pwr steering fluid fixed it.  The stock radio is below average and the speakers were blown when I got it.  The body has not rusted, but the black paint is starting to fade on the hood. The 3 door is kind of a pain just having one door and when putting groceries in the back seat since you can't fit the cart in the opening.  Other than that I like this truck very much.  I've only performed maintenance. Oil every 3K, brake flush, transmission flush, and diff fluid changed.

Had to replace the intermediate steering shaft the first year. The vehicle constantly looses prime and shuts down. Here's the kicker . The oil pressure gauge flutters and the annoying chime rings constantly indicating low oil pressure. The cluster panel has been changed twice, the oil pressure sending unit has been changed three times. They even changed the oil pump? Still, no fix. This truck has been a nightmare from day one!"
gmc,sierra-2500,2004,Roscoe, 09/03/2010,Not Happy!,2,"This vehicle became a nightmare after about 10,000 miles. First the steering shaft failed ... ? That's right, the steering shaft! Next the instrument cluster had to be replaced since the low oil pressure warning kept chiming. It still chimes uncontrollably after replacing the oil pressure sending unit three times, the oil and filter five times (when it didn't need it), and get this ... they changed the oil pump and the thing still chimes at will! The truck rides like a tank. Now the steering gear box needs to be replaced. There are less than 85,000 miles on this pig!"

Rear seat area is huge. Seats are very comfortable. Ride is a little choppy unloaded, but that is to be expected. Smoother ride than GMC 2500 Heavy Duty. Tracks down the road very nicely. (This next comment is not a flame, I'm a truck guy, not a ""brand guy"") Much better than Ford 250, which tended to wander a bit - that may have been due to the more aggressive off- road tires on the Ford. With a bed cover in place, gas mileage went from 17.5 mpg highway to just over 18 mpg highway. Every bit helps. XM radio is worth every cent. On-Star is invaluable.

It's a good looking vehicle. Has more ground clearance than Ford or Dodge without being too tall to go in a parking garage. Build quality and materials/ components used are better than competitors also. I've heard (for example) Ford doesn't put grease fittings on a lot of they're front end parts.

So far it stranded me once (due to a clip of some sort coming loose and the computer not knowing enough to send fuel to the engine) and that was at about 7k miles. OnStar answered quickly and got me a tow truck pronto! The dealer easily found the problem and my cost for all this was $0. The Bose system is very enjoyable.

I was amazed how much better the ride is in the 2007 Sierra Classic. Duramax/Allison combo a real delight to tow with. The Allison 6 speed works incredibly well with the Duramax to couple all of that torque to the ground as well as assisting in stopping the whole load. Torque comes in at about 1500 RPMS and this thing launches like a rocket. Great fit and finish. I researched all other diesels and I'm happy I stuck with GMC.

The ride quality will rival expensive luxury cars. People ask me all the time if it is really a diesel because it is so quiet.

After 11 months of trying to like this truck, I would take my 4 year old Ford back in a heartbeat. The much-touted Allison tranny screams like a banshee when I am towing up the long steep mountain roads in NM and AZ. It's clunky and jerky. Trips to the dealership have found nothing wrong. The mileage runs around a dismal 13 mpg vs. 18+ for the '03 Ford.  This heavy duty truck came with puny 6 ply road tires on it, which I think is ridiculous. I resent having to shell out for 10 ply Michelin all terrain tires at 6000 miles because the truck tires couldn't get a grip on our muddy winter roads, even in 4WD."

From the Dealer using my truck to tow the owners horse trailer (when turned in for maintenance) and adding 100 miles to it...to the more than $3000 I had to put into the electrical within 3 months-to the instrument panel stopping to work (speedo, then oil pressure, then battery-which comes and goes) $900 fix it so I just use a GPS for my speedo-to the rattle in the steering because of design issue always going out....to the electric seat positioning clicking 7-8 times before settling into place-to now the heater/AC blower stopped working and a cost of $750 to fix it at PEP Boys.
Thanks to youtube the heater fix will only cost me $150 in parts.

The heater went out again in a couple of weeks.  replace resistor again, heater stopped again!
Either this truck is a lemon OR my favorite GMC's are on their way out of business.
(I am in Quality management and would not have allowed anything close to this happening where I work)

pull a 8'x12' trailer with it loaded 
with ATV's and a motorcycle and the 
truck does all I want it to.  I traded 
a Powerstroke in and I am pleased that 
I did.  It's quite and rides and 
handles a lot better then my old Ford. 
I am getting around 12mpg at freeway 
speeds with this load."
gmc,sierra-3500,2004,Pilot, 04/18/2008,2004 3500 Duramax 6.6 SLT DRW Crew Cab,4,"I've had this truck for almost 4 years, and I have nothing but good to say. I have a 37' 5th wheel, which when loaded is right at 16300 lbs and it pulls it great. Now I'm not going to tell you that I don't know the 5th wheel is back there, but this truck is a joy to drive while pulling. She'll be paid for in a couple of months, and I plan to keep her for a long time."
gmc,sierra-3500,2004,Rich in suffolk, 01/20/2004,GMC Sierra duramax,4,"You can always ask for more, but this 
truck gives the best of all I have ever 
driven. The Duramax is quiet and it 
seems to have more pep than my old 350 
gas. Over the road unloaded I have 
gotten 22 mpg at I-95 speeds. Pulling a 
medium size 5th wheel is a pleasure. 
The allison transmission is absolutely 
super. I will buy another. By the way 
my other car is a Ford ambulance 
(diesel), the powerstroke is great but 
can't hold a candle to the duramax. The 
Dodge is just too loud."
gmc,sierra-3500,2004,Gilles, 06/07/2006,Duramax Dually 2004,4,"I purchased the Sierra dually Duramax (LLY - 310hp & 605flbs) to pull a heavy fifth wheel and so far my experience has been trouble free.  So far I am fully satisfied although I only have 30,000 km and time will provide more information on reliability of the Duramax.  I find it fun to drive and fuel efficiency is good compared to the other diesel (Ford & Chrysler).  It provide plenty of performance compare to a gas engine. The interior is perhaps blend as per the critics but it provides a price advantage compare to the Ford's King Ranch.  It does not take away from the performance."
gmc,sierra-3500,2004,Ryan S., 06/21/2020,Amazing truck!,5,"In my opinion the Sierra is one of the greatest GM vehicles ever made. From how comfortable it is all the way down to the quality of the cv shafts and control arms, this truck is all around amazing. Lots of low end torque! I would definitely recommend this truck to anyone!

gmc,sierra-3500,2005,Crusty Codger, 09/15/2009,Best of breed,4," Except for the cruise control switch that failed early on and the really poor tires that were provided I have had zero problems with my  GMC 3500 long bed duramax allison crew cab dually that I purchased in 2005.  My GMC has largely been used for hauling trailers, including my 35 foot fifth wheel, a car hauler and a 20 foot box trailer.  The diesel never falters, even on fairly sharp inclines. And compared to Ford or Dodge the engine remains quite quiet."
gmc,sierra-3500,2005,drew, 04/12/2005,'05 GMC Sierra Dually,4,"Great truck! Traded in '01 F350 7.3L for the GMC. The GMC is much more driver friendly with comfort and a more car like feel. Power from the Duramax is very good as compared to the ""chipped out"" F350. On the downside, the truck, although a softer feel overall, is a bit more bouncy than the Ford. Interior room is much smaller in the front and rear of the crew-cab. "
gmc,sierra-3500,2005,ronshoney, 06/06/2005,GMC 3500,5,"It's a beautiful truck, feels like your riding in luxury.  We have the TV/DVD package and that works great for our 4 kids who fit comfortably in the back on long trips.  Good on gas for something that size, always runs and drives great.  Have also used it to pull out the tractor when it got buried plowing the field, was not a problem it came right out and the truck barely had to try.  Also pulled out a boat hauler that was stuck in a field, no limit to this truck."

gmc,sierra-3500,2005,DREW, 08/06/2006,2005 GMC 3500 SLT DRW,3,"The comfort and drivabilty beats the Ford 350. I had an '01 F350 which was a great truck, but had some reliabilty problems and the brakes were not up to the task. The GMC is much better overall with towing and the interior is more car like. My biggest complaint about the truck is the gray steel rims with cheap trim rings. For over $40K the truck should be outfitted with Ford/Dodge similar rims. I almost went for the Ford again because of this."

It hauls my 42' 5th wheel with no difficulty and my daughter enjoys the DVD system w/the wireless headphones only a little more than I do. Great sound system and entertainment system. Shocks are a little stiff but only when I'm not hauling. I did a lot of comparision shopping and my GMC had the most options for the best price."

I have hauled volleyball teams, 15000lbs 5th wheel up the Cascades, to work everyday and a multiple runs crosscounty and I smile everytime I start this truck up. Do I have complaints? One, the roof liner fit and finish leaves alot to be desired :( I have drove the rest and this is hands down the best. A Quiet diesel that can smoke the tires. I laugh when the Toyota boys try to pull something heavy up the mountains, they just don't have it. It will be the last truck I own. "

I bought an aftermarket engine program to increase performance, and with this chip I get 20mpg empty, 15mpg with boat or camper, 13mpg with boat and camper.  Programer takes 5 minutes and allows me to program for specific loads or to put it back to stock settings, recommend this. There has not been 1 problem with truck and have already put on 12,000 miles in the first 4 months. Very happy customer. "
gmc,sierra-3500,2006,MyGMCLemon, 04/28/2006,A disaster,2,I am absoultely horrified that I have a brand new vehicle that actually just shuts itself off while I am driving. It has now been into the dealership twice with only 1200 miles on it. Since they can not get codes out of the computer they can not isolate the problem and fix it. This truck has been a nightmare. It has been to the dealership twice now for repair. I still do not have it back and they still can not figure out what is wrong.
gmc,sierra-3500,2006,my86gmc, 03/16/2009,My retirement truck that I love !!,4,"Best truck I have ever owned, period. Not sure what these other bad reviews are about? I have had no major problems. This truck pulls my 5th wheel better than anything on the road. Many Diesel magazines have given this truck its best in class award, and for good reason. Its a very comfortable truck to drive and loves to be hot rodded around.  I'm at 45000 miles looking forward to many years of driving and towing with this. I added a Delco navigation unit plus a Delco 6 cd changer, it was well worth the price. "
gmc,sierra-3500,2006,rick, 08/31/2009,Great Truck,4,"Excellent drivability. This truck has more power than the comparable Ford or Dodge, better mileage, and is MUCH quieter! (I'm a Dodge man) Mileage varies from 22 (cruise at 55mph, no load) to 12 (90mph with truck loaded and 14,000lb trailer). Plently of room in the cab and a full length bed too! Only problem with the truck is the moonroof has stuck open 3 times and lots of wind noise when open. The moonroof cover is designed more like a screen - the sun sure gets hot at an angle that directly shines on driver. The original tires had sidewall integrity problems at 55K. Goodyear great with warranty issues. The fuel gage takes a while to show that the tank is actually full (10min - 1hour)."
gmc,sierra-3500,2006,daveo08, 11/29/2007,2007 GMC 3500 carbon monoxide in cab.,1,"Having driven this truck only a short distance, 2400 miles, problems are already evident. The worst being a diagnosis, from a blood sample test, of carbon monoxide poisoning due to cab infilteration. This is caused by the missfiring of the injection electronics package and the poor cab fit and finish allowing the engine exhaust to get into the cab unless the recirculate mode is used on the heating system. Recirculate is defeated by the controller which will not allow the recirculate mode to be engaged except on max ac. The engine has very poor throttle response and smokes excessively under heavy acceleration. The engine has a propensity to consume oil. "

liked the looks. I could have lived 
without the two tone leather, in-dash 
six CD changer, stereo controls on 
steering wheel, wood grain dash bezels, 
etc but after driving the truck I just 
had to have that big 6.0, 325 HP, 370

hauls butt and with the all wheel drive 
I never worry about smoking the tires. 
It pulls my boat like it wasnt even

First impression: The best looking truck I'd ever seen. (I have the black one.) Second impression: The most powerful truck I'd ever driven. Third impression: The most versatile vehicle man has ever made. I can't say enough good things. If I want to go out on the town, I get it detailed, and it turns heads. If I need to tow 9000 lbs through the mud, I don't hesitate, and neither does the truck. I bought my C3 with 25k miles, and now have 122k miles. I've owned 15 cars/trucks - this is the best by far. From the other reviews, I'm not alone! "
gmc,sierra-c3,2001,BK, 12/17/2009,Still Truckin',4,"This is the best truck ever.  I slammed the original tranny last year hauling the RV, but that wasn't too bad to replace.  Horsepower is awesome.  Dual Flowmasters sound deep and strong.  111k on this bad boy and I'm not about to give it up now. Bought it with 80K. Hauls our 29' RV w/out a problem, pontoon boat doesn't even make it breath hard.  My 10yr old son wants it when he turns 16.  We'll see about that.  I would like to see how it matches up to the new GMC with 402hp.  I bet with AWD it will keep up or beat it.  "

wheel trailer.  I towed the 5th wheel 
very little because my son wanted to 
pull it with his truck.  I did pull 
flatbed trailers with farm tractor and 
pulled loads of feed and hay.  This

It is tough, fun to drive and classy."

bought this truck, because it's 
beautiful. In a class of it's own 
beautiful. That and its exclusivity, 
mine is the only black one I have ever 
seen and I live just outside Chicago. 
As far as the ride, the motor is ample 
(a whopping 6L V8) and road noise is 
minimal. Handling is exceptional for a 
2 1/2 pound truck. The suspension is a 
little bouncy on concrete roads, but 
that is the only driving complaint I 
have. With a payload weight of 1800 
lbs. and a tow weight of 8800 lbs, 
this truck is a workhorse too. I feel 
lucky to have one every day that I get 
in it."

I have never spun a tire with the full time AWD.  Solid tow vehicle. The weight and balance is such that the ride will amaze.  A different league from my prior Z-71. The window sticker said 14 and 12 mpg, thank goodness it was wrong.  I can get 17+ on highway at about 70mph light load, but 16 is more the norm. For 80,000 I have averaged 15.5 per the computer which is pretty accurate. If you tow something heavy look for 11-12.  GM pretty well hit the nail on the head with this truck. Good paint, still looks new.  "

gmc,sierra-classic-2500,2000,Grant, 01/12/2007,Daily Driver,4,"Bought this truck to replace a '97 Chevy 1500 extended cab.  Family was getting older and it made sense to get evry body their own door. Full size rear seat. Tons of room between back of front seat and front of back seat. I checked a bunch of crew cab trucks and this one really had a full sized back seat with lots of knee room. We take the boys with the local scout troop on outings sometimes and the boys refer to it as ""the boat"" . you can sit in the back and marvel at how far away the front seat is. A 6 footer can sit in back and cross their legs! A 30 ft travel trailer, 2 bikes, 2 kayaks and a sunfish sailboat and there's still room for more."

transmission.  Cost 2000 to fix.  GM 
paid half.  Repair was done at about 
70000km, just beyond warranty.  OK 
since.  If you notice any tranny 
clunk, insist dealer fix under 
warranty.  Don't wait around like I 
did.  6 litre engine is flawless.  
Front end has never been touched-still 
tracks straight.  I just did front 
brakes for the first time.  The old

I took it in to the dealership for repairs and they told me they had to replace the instrument cluster and they did not guarantee that it would solve the problem. A co-worker had the same problem with his. I expect better reliability then this from a 2000 year model.

gmc,sonoma,2000,Joe, 04/01/2006,Too many problems,2,I bought this truck used when it had 90K.   After having it for only a year the transmission blew on me.  I had just replaced the clutch and when the transmission went out it took out the clutch too. I spent $2000 repairing it. I only had the truck for 2 years and I regularly maintained it but in those two years I spent about $4000 in repairs. This can't be normal for a newer model car.  
gmc,sonoma,2000,ASI FD, 06/21/2002,Will never purchase another one.,1,"I have had nothing but problems with

contacted GMC to discuss my concerns 
about the vehicle and they have yet to 
offer any type of an solution.  The 
problem is that the Maryland Lemon Law 
is only good for the first 10,000 miles 
on the vehicle.  I put 10,000 miles on 
the truck in the first 6 months that I 
owned it.  Just another case of a 
company taking advantage of a consumer, 
how is one person going to make a 
difference to out total sales?"
gmc,sonoma,2000,Ray, 11/16/2006,PEE-UUUU,2,"Bought with 74k on it. 1st and last GMC. Poor gas mileage. AC leaks out in a week and now bad heater core that requires total removal of dash and disconnect AC lines under hood just to remove heater core. Dealer wants $1,100 to replace. Lost my shirt on this truck"
gmc,sonoma,2000,jgcops, 09/15/2006,Anyone else run out of gas,2,"After 6 days with the truck I ran out of gas becuase the gas gauge didn't work.  The dealership was very helpful until they had to pay $2500 then they said sorry you are on your own.  Upon further review of S10/Sonoma web sites I see that this gas gauge problem is not just mine.  My rear passenger door handle also broke after a couple of months.  It does get good gas mileage for a truck, and the 4WD works excellent.  Overall, this is not a bad small truck, but everytime I get in and see the low fuel light on and I know it is full, I become angry and want to get rid of it."
gmc,sonoma,2000,Thom Kolesar, 08/08/2002,The 3 year lease...,3,"Make no mistakes, the vehicle rides 
like a truck, not a car.  The feel I 
was looking for, you may not want that 
up higher feel like a truck mode?  
There were 7 return trips to the 
dealership for what I see as Q.C. 
issues. Such as a loose shock mounting 
bolt, a third door latch that spit the 
spring out 3 months after purchase, 
both seat back handles snapped in 
regular service, an obvious flaw in 
manufacturing and most recently the 
fuel pump needed replacement @ 33,400 
miles."
gmc,sonoma,2000,LAH, 08/20/2002,Love my Sonoma,4,"I have owned my Sonoma for over two and 
I can't think of much to complain 
about.  The only problem I've had is at 
one point, the rubber seal around the 
windshield started coming off.  This 
was fixed and covered by the warranty 
and has not been a problem since.  No 
mechanical problems- still runs like 
new.  I definitely recommend opting for 
the V6.  It's a lot of fun to drive but 
the city gas mileage isn't so great.  
Overall, I have really enjoyed driving 
this vehicle."
gmc,sonoma,2000,Robt, 03/15/2003,Junk,2,"Never again...This is the worst vehicle 
I've ever owned (with the exception of 
a 77 Dodge power wagon) as far as 
reliability goes.
Mine has a lot of miles but they are 
all highway and I have serviced it 
regualary. 
Shortly after warranty expired I had to 
put a $750.00 fuel pump on it, now 
theres either a wheel bearing or 
differential going out and howling like 
a banchee, the transmission is giving 
me troubles.  

The interior quality is awful, the 
steering wheel looks like it has 
leprosy, the power windows make noise 
and sound like they are falling out. 

In brief....I'll never buy another GM 
product as long as I live."
gmc,sonoma,2000,RONL, 03/19/2003,GMC be ashamed,2,"This vehicle came out in about 1995. It 
had problems with handles breaking off 
and very bad front ends. At 60000 miles 
I had to put $2500 in the front end. 
Both wheel bearings gone and the 
bearing are in a housing that requires 
the replacement of the whole housing.

GMC knew about the problems and instead 
of improving the design over the years, 
just ignored the problems and allowed 
us to keep paying to keep this junk 
running."

The gas destroyed my engine. From 25 hwy/18.5 city to 14.5 hwy/12.5 city. In 9 months. The roads are so crappy they shook the speakers off their mounts and the asphalt ripped up my tires. They were pristine at 15,000 and needed replacing when I traded it in at 25,000 in 2006. It broke my heart to let it go but I couldn't afford whatever would happen next. Sparkplugs, EPA accessories, hoses, and belts were all replaced at 23,000, but the MPG didn't recover. WARNING!! Don't bring a midwest vehicle to California, sell it and buy one made for out here."

The fuel pump goes out about every other year, the power windows stop working, cd player stopped working. Had 38000 miles when I bought it (5-6years ago) and I only drive to work and back no heavy hauling it now has 100000 miles and the rear end is going out the transmission is going out couple of sensors in the motor are failing and it sits behind my garage..not the best $18000 spent! Really like the truck when it's running and not costing me money."
gmc,sonoma,2001,Sonoboy, 12/15/2009,sonoma review,3,"Great little truck.  Have a plow mount for it and it works great.  Easy sight lines in reverse.  Nice, comfortable interior.  A/C works good, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, reading lights in the mirrors, mirror defrost option is really handy!!!  Decent leg room, a little crampy on longer rides for big guys.  Powerful motor that gets the job done.  Nice package.  Plenty of bed room and the extended cab provides a nice area for extra storage when you need it."
gmc,sonoma,2001,truckkid, 03/01/2007,Respectable Little Truck,3,"I was given this vehicle after my first vehicle's engine died. This is a stylish and smooth riding vehicle, but this is not the type of truck I wanted. I prefer trucks that are raised and larger. Overall, through the 2+ years i've had it, it has been mostly reliable, except i've had to replace the starter 3 times!! I would suggest this as a perfect truck for a beginning driver, because it is only a 4 cyl, has good gas mileage and wasn't an expensive purchase. This truck should be a parent's best friend, especially if they purchase the 4 cyl model because it is hard to speed in a truck equipped with so little horsepower!"
gmc,sonoma,2001,dale_3, 08/03/2002,Super Sonoma,4,"I bought this Sonoma after a crazy 
woman turned directly into the path of 
my '96 Sonoma.
The only complaint I have is with the 
stock General tires. Replacing with a 
softer compound increases performance 
and ride. No problems at all with my 
truck, I have a long commute to work 
and it has performed flawlessly.
I do find just a bit of weight in the 
bed helps with everyday driving. The 
controls and comfort are good, the 
engine is incredibly strong. I highly 
reccomend this truck."
gmc,sonoma,2001,rreed2000, 09/28/2003,Mixed Feelings,3,"Fan clutch had to be replaced and hood had to 
be repainted due to loss of glossy finish 
immediately after purchase, valves are noisy at 
1,700 rpm - but dealer says ""yeah, they're 
noisy but that's normal.""
Other than the items listed above, poor over 
build quality and less-than-stellar gas 
mileage, I'd have to admit that the truck has 
been reliable.  But I will probably never buy 
another GM product because of my 
experiences with this one."

The biggest mistake was getting one 
with California Emmissions, I have had 
the Airpump go out 3 times on me and 
the last time wasn't under warranty, 
it cost me over $300 to fix.  Also,

gmc,sonoma,2001,Icebox, 04/23/2009,'01 Sonoma SLS,4,"I own a 2001 GMC Sonoma SLS, 2.2L 5spd Reg. Cab with the short-Stepside bed. It's a great little truck, a bit on the small side if you're a bigger person, (I'm 6'3"", 280lbs) but I still seem to fit in there alright. It handles pretty well in town and it's easy to park because of its size, but when you're traveling at high speeds or going down windy roads, you can tell it's a light truck. Repair bills aren't usually too steep because the Sonoma shares parts with the Blazer, Jimmy and S-10 so getting cheap parts is easy. All and all, it's a pretty good little truck."
gmc,sonoma,2001,scott S, 01/24/2010,not bad for GMC,3,"What can one say about a underpowered truck. It drives great but maybe you should have bought a Honda engine to power this beauty. I'd suggest the 2.4 Honda crv engine. This truck drive great and gets ok gas mileage as long as you stay off the highway. Whoever thought of butting 4/11 gears in a underpowered truck. Oh, maybe that's it, I see you have to compensate for the lack of power by gearing the truck low.   The lack of quality is amazing, I've had to replace the third door handle three times until I fabricated and metal substitute. the emergency break actuator two times.   "

only replaced the battery.  (delco 
batteries aren't top quality).  Gas 
gauge failed at 41k, thank god I bought 
extended warranty. I still paid $140 
out of my pocket to fix gauge. I paid 
18,600 used, 14k miles on it

Powerful V6 engine - a bit noisy but very high torque and towing power for a small truck. Very quiet cabin and smooth ride for a truck. Edmunds must have been looking at a lesser trim package. My loaded SLS Crew Cab has a very nice interior, very nice upholstery and I always receive compliments from people."

Rides better with a load in the bed. Very reliable. Interior gauges easy to see. Daytime running lights & it switches automatically to night headlamps, very useful. Comfortable. Perfectly engineered for its purpose. Good looking exterior. I added a soft tonneau, then a cap when I could afford, which helped gas mileage 1-2 mpg. Great visibility without cap, limited but acceptable with cap. Small bump in bed where gas tank is, not a big deal. Good turning radius."

it the most dangerous pick-up truck I've ever driven. Low unconfortable seats

gmc,sonoma,2002,Matt, 10/28/2015,Good little truck.,4,"Bought the truck used with 120k miles for a steal, it's pushing 180k now and I've done nothing to this truck other than basic maintenance. The only issues I've had with it are a crap radio (which is a common GM problem) and the typical rust on these little trucks.
As far as the rust goes, the fender wells on the bed are for the most part completely gone, but the stepside trucks seem to be plagued with this issue. Slight rust on the cab corners and rockers, and the spare tire cable rusted and the tire fell off. 
As far as reliability, it's been among the best I've owned. It's not a powerhouse, but the little 2.2 does well when mated to the 5 speed. It doesn't seem to like interstate travel, as its runs about 3k rpms at 75 mph, but it cruises right along. 
The engine is noisy, it has that trademark 2.2 timing chain noise, but it has no effect on performance. Replacing with oem parts will cure it, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Overall I love my little truck, and wouldn't hesitate to buy another. May go for a 4.3 next time for more power.

gmc,sonoma,2002,Wishbone, 06/20/2008,170000 mile review,3,"I bought this truck new. The biggest complaint I have is the warranty is not good. At 30000 miles the rear axle went out. They rebuilt it with no questions asked. At 40000 miles it went out again, again they rebuilt it and no questions asked. I never towed anything and never abused the truck. The mechanic said he heard a whine at 50000 miles and he was overriden by the rep that was deaf and said he heard nothing. At 52000 miles the rear axle crapped out again and GMC said it was out of warranty and I was on my own. Got a junk yard axle and have had no problems with it since. I've replaced the A/C compressor and the fuel pump, but no other major items and am at 170000 miles! Love this truck"

The performance is great with the 4.3 engine. We drive for 7 hrs to get up north in the summer and we both feel fresh, even tho we each sat in the same position all the way. We make sure that it is maintained regularly. We are seniors and are depending on never getting rid of our 2002 Sonoma 4x4 extended cab. "
gmc,sonoma,2002,BigD, 05/29/2009,Great little workhorse!,5,This is a little truck with an attitude...I have the 4.3 V6 and it will take on those big boys like the full size fords and dodges and stay with them. now this is a stock V6 and it has the sound of a big boy! it tows real good and can carry a big load and still do 70mph...so if you are looking at this model of a truck you will not be disapointed if you buy it!
gmc,sonoma,2002,wgraham, 06/12/2002,Good so far...,4,"The only complaint I have is the 
vortec V-6, while more than enough

these though and am very happy overall."
gmc,sonoma,2002,ChadneyG5, 04/24/2010,Awesome. Wish they still made them.,4,"I bought this truck new. I drive it every day & have ridden it hard with frequent off-roading and towing. It has had almost no problems. I now have 130k miles on it (in 2010) & it runs like new. Other than regular maintenance, I've only had to replace the fuel pump & water pump. There is a door hinge pin that is a design flaw that must be replaced approx. every 100k mi. for $40. I've owned 3 Toyota trucks previously and got this because of the 0% 60mo. financing. None of my Toyotas ran this well for so long, with such comfort. The MPG was about the same. I average 16-18."

great truck. I just traded my 2002 
Sonoma SLS Extended Cab( 4 cylinder ) 
for this. There is alot more room 
inside the truck, it is LOADED with 
everything. The biggest let down for 
me is the gas mileage. The Sonoma SLS 
Extended Cab 2WD( 4 cylinder )was 
worse on gas than our 2002 Grand Prix 
GT and the ZR5 is just a little worse 
than the 4 cylinder. The truck is a 
little overpriced( $28,000 ) but is 
really worth the extra money. The 
Flame Yellow color is extremely bright 
and it catches alot of attention."

When the lease ran out, I was totally prepared to lease my third 4x4 Sonoma, only to find out they discontinued it for a goofy 5 cylinder replacement. So I bought my lease truck with 29,000 miles on it. The only trouble I've had is needing to replace the instrument cluster at 34,000 miles because both the temperature and fuel guages became intermittant. But,I really love this little 4x4. It's been reliable and tough, with gobs of smooth power. It still gets 19 mpg in town and 23 on the road, not too bad for a big v6, 4x4.This truck has not developed one single rattle or squeak since I first got it. All in all, it's a dandy. "

gmc,sonoma,2002,foster, 03/16/2009,love my sonoma,4,"expensive truck to fix, only 85000 kms, changed o2 sensors, battery, brakes, front bearings, front bushings, 4x4 actuator valve, around $3000 so far in repairs, paint is chipping off bottom 2 inches of the 3rd door, still love my truck, 4x4 does not engage properly when its below 0 degrees C. Moisture buildup in the air line."
gmc,sonoma,2002,dustin, 05/20/2009,Great little truck,4,"I haven't had this truck very long so i can't say about the reliability. But it seems really solid. I have the zr2 package. It rides really good for a 4x4. The gas mileage isn't horrible, it is a truck after all. It will get up and go, but my moms minivan will go faster. But her van can't go thru mud!!!"
gmc,sonoma,2002,N. J., 06/15/2002,Vibration buy-back,3,"This is a follow-up to my earlier 
rating. The truck IS unrepairable. It 
has taken GMC TWO MONTHS to admit this 
and authorize a buy back. They started 
to charge me useage for the 400 
miserable miles I drove it. Unmitigated 
gall! Now I'm told they don't want to 
re-imburse me for the sales tax. I'm 
out of patience and looking at other 
brands, GM card be damned."
gmc,sonoma,2002,GRB, 07/27/2002,ZQ8 Sport Suspension Review,3,"The Good:  Sport suspension improves 
the appearance and handling of the 
truck tremendously.

The Bad:  Inherent to the sport 
suspension is a rough ride and frequent 
vibration from the rear of the truck.

Conclusion:  Buy this model only if 
you're willing to sacrifice ride 
comfort for performance."
gmc,sonoma,2002,gordon1fan, 08/09/2002,My 2002 GMC Sonoma Regular Cab,4,"At the time that I was writing this, 
my GMC Sonoma has about 450 miles.  My 
2002 GMC Sonoma SL Regular Cab 
features a four-cylinder Vortec 2.2 
liter engine with sequential port fuel 
injection that is powered by producing 
120 horsepower and 140 lbs-ft of 
torque. My vehicle also has Automatic 
transmission and all-season SBR tires. 

I really did not get the truck that I 
wanted.  I was shopping around for a 
extended cab, automatic with a 4.3 
liter V6.  I had to get what I could 
afford, so I test drove and bought 
this 2002 GMC Sonoma SL Regular Cab."

Cold air intake and a hypertech chip and you've got a sport truck.  I love blowing away the occassional sport compacts and full- sized ""accessorized"" trucks!  Power-to- weight ratio...you do the math (275hp+small, light truck= HOLD ON!)"
gmc,sonoma,2002,Walt K, 07/11/2004,Solid reliable truck,3,"I have almost 50,000 miles on my 6 cyl
extended cab SLS and it has performed
perfectly ever since it was driven out
of the showroom.  Absolutely no
mechanical problems at all.
The ride is a little rough and the seats
are not as comfortable as I would like.
 But the V6 is strong and the auto trans
shifts nicely.  I drive on the highway a
lot and my gas milage averages just
above 20 MPG."
gmc,sonoma,2002,B-man, 09/15/2004,Like it...... but,4,"I like my truck and plan on keeping it 
for a long time. The 4.3 has plenty of 
power for me although it is a bit 
thirsty. I haven't had any reliability 
issues at all. My complaints come from 
GM's classic little things like, I'm 
on my 3rd radio and this one is 
messing up. (out of warranty now) Wind 
noise from drivers door weather 
stripping. (that the dealer couldn't 
hear when it was under warranty)
Intermittent wiper switch slowly faded 
and is now on a mood basis. Noise from 
the front right wheel well when I turn 
left and accelerate hard. Scared to go 
to the dealer on this one!! Only other 
complaint is gas milage. Tows plenty, 
but hauls nothing!"
gmc,sonoma,2002,hoss II, 10/13/2004,gmc items,3,"Vehicle needs aproximately 50 more 
horse power to be a good work truck.  
It suffers from a blind spot over the 
right rear corner due to the location 
and size of the c pillar and rear seat 
headrests.  The fit and finish of the 
sheet metal (out of Linden NJ) was less 
than stellar.  Warranty repairs to AC 
compressor, transfer case electric 
shift solenoid and air distribution 
system vacuum motors required"
gmc,sonoma,2002,SwampRat, 11/11/2004,Drinks like a fish,4,"I like my 2002 GMC Sonoma, but it has terrible gas mileage.
It averages about 13 mpg for me.  My 
1984 full size 4WD truck got better mileage (and 
that was a V8 compared to this 6-cylinder).  
Aside from that, it's been a good truck.  It's 
comfortable, rides well, and I've had little in 
the way of problems.  The rear left side's 
window's weatherstripping cracked, but it was 
replaced under warranty.  As long as you 
can afford the gas for it, I'd highly 
recommend this truck.  I've also driven Dodge and 
Ford compact pickups, and I'd definitely recommend 
the Sonoma over either of them.  If you're going to get a 
truck like this, DEFINITELY get a 3 door.  It's 
worth it!  "
gmc,sonoma,2002,Linda, 08/02/2006,Poor gas mileage/repairs under warranty?,3,"I have a roar in the engine from time to time that sounds like I have shifted to 4 WD when it is definitely in 2WD. Taken in to the dealer and he can never hear that sound. Does not do it all the time but when it does it sounds like the engine is going to come out from under the hood. Been in the shop 5x with shifting problems, shims, water in headlamp, wind noise both front doors, very poor gas mileage empty load or pulling trailor. Would not recommend this truck to anyone.Center console is too small and tight up front. backseat leg area too small. Just me and the dog and still not enough room.Bummer cruise control. Cheap, would have paid the difference for a good cruise controller."
gmc,sonoma,2002,Kent Bryant, 12/01/2006,2002 Sonoma 4wd Ext. cab OK but w/caveat,3,"I have no idea if they made the shell flimsier or not with this year model, but I had two previous Sonomas which did not receive anywhere near the small body dents.  Also, the older models actually had better accessories than this new one such as rear defrost and sun visor mirrors.  Also, the 4WD switching buttons on the inside console predictable failed at my 3 year ownership mark, so now I am limited to 2-wheel drive even though I own a 4WD truck.  Have no idea what it will cost me to get that fixed.  It was always troublesome from the beginning.  Other than that, pretty reliable vehicle after 4 years."
gmc,sonoma,2002,safeman, 07/26/2007,Love it after 100K miles,4,"Have had the truck for 5 years and have a little over 111,000 miles on it. Other than regular maintenance, have not had to repair anything. Got 105,000 miles on the original tires!  Extremely reliable. Rides as well today as when I first bought it.  Had an accident in it at 80 mph on I-95. I was hit in the passenger door, spun 180 degrees and slid across 3 lanes of oncoming traffic. I ended up facing the wrong way on the opposite shoulder of the interstate. The truck was rock solid during the entire ordeal.  The truck still looks good, runs well and is comfortable. It still  gets 20 mpg. After reading some of the earlier comments, I wonder whether we are talking about the same vehicle."
gmc,sonoma,2002,bigwarranty, 05/08/2003,Once the problems were fixed...,3,"The first 5 month of ownership were
hell.  The truck had water leaks like
you would not believe.  They fixed 5
different leaks 4 times, and replaced
the rug and jute 3 times because mold
from the water getting under the rug
made the interior unhealthy to even sit
in.  LSS, the Division Manager met with
me and gave me options.  I wanted them
to buy back the truck, but they wanted
to charge me for miles.  No way!  In the
end,  I let them fix this truck ""one
last time"" and I would agree to keep it
if they gave me a 7 yr./100,000 mile
bumper to bumper warranty.  Once
everything was fixed, I fell in love
with my truck... and it smells like a
new truck should."
gmc,sonoma,2003,Deer Slayer, 03/15/2006,Truck I have Always Wanted,4,"I came to the dealership to see a ZR2 S-10, next to it was this Bright yellow, 2003, GMC Sonoma ZR2.  I FEEL IN LOVE WITH IT.  I always wanted this truck, this style, this color.   Since I bought it I have done some off- roading and some highway driving and have been pleased with it on both ideas.  I look forward to driving my truck everyday and find myself, more times then not, when i park it and walk away, turning around and looking at it thinking, WOW!"
gmc,sonoma,2003,Elwood Noble, 01/15/2018,Still doing it!,4,"Still a good truck and again, though we paid a pretty penny for it and have had the normal repairs that come from an aging truck we have found that it has performed very well and aged very gracefully. I have read all negatives here and elsewhere but very few have talked about the core of this truck, its perseverance and continuation! Our Sonoma has served not only myself and my wife but our daughter who is in the military who took the truck not only from California to Washington D.C to North Carolina to Europe and then back to California and all in all it did and is doing a very great job! I am not saying that it is perfect, doors do not completely seal, certain electrical issues have arisen, gas mileage stink, tends to burn up brakes quicker than other vehicles we own but dealing with that stuff, which is very small in incident, the truck has held its own! Yet in my book, between a 1, lowest, to a 10, the greatest, I give it a solid 7 so know that this is a very good score for a truck that is now 15 years old and over a 100k miles! Go GMC! American made all the way (only one plant in Canada!)

The driver's seat is comfortable for long trips, but the back seat will only hold adults for short trips.  The radio is good for stock.  This is a good truck. It always starts easily, even in cold weather, but I'm not sure I can afford the gas."

gmc,sonoma,2003,Bruce, 10/20/2005,Terrible Attempt at a Truck,2,"I've had this truck for 2 years now and I absolutely hate it.  A friend had one and I thought that it looked good, so I bought it without testing it at all.  What a dumb move.  It gets terrible fuel economy.  Has absolutely no power, terrible, no passing power at all, no bottom end.  Have to put it into 4X4 low to get any power.  That is where it is actually good. In the mud it is great, cause it is so light. The 4X4 low will crawl along at 200 rpm.  However, the interior is way too small, and I sit so that my hip is bent and bothers me amazingly on long trips.  But, it is in the shop as we speak having the transfer case replaced (50063 km). "
gmc,sonoma,2003,Conserned Customer, 12/30/2007,I could design a better truck!,3,"First off, bought the truck on GM's reputation.

it.  Windshield seal came out at 
highway speed a week after I got it.  
Dealership said it happens allot in 
warm climatesHELLO GM HOW ABOUT 
FIXING THE PROBLEM IF IT HAPPENS 
ALLOT.  Interior is cheap and truck 
has already been having electrical 
problems (shorts causing check engine 
light to come on).  I spent more time 
in a rental Neon than in my new 
truck.  It is very capable off road.  
I think my problems are more from 
cheap workmanship than faulty parts.  
GM should slow down their assembly 
line and pay attention to what their 
doing."

Had 4 miles on it, when it was delivered to dealer. I test drove it first right off the truck. It was listed for $23.1k , w/ discounts $17.4k> on the window sticker, just another inflated mark up gimmick. @6am that morning   the t v promo price was $9995, I called the dealer to make sure the offer was valid. Taxes, fees was extra. I also asked him to fill the tank so I could make a 2 hour trip home. I forgot to bring any extra cash. My wife insisted she will drive it home, I drove her car. When getting home she bashes it into the mail box entering our driveway. OH! &*^$ . I've never heard it misfire. Never needed a tune up, it will still bark the tires when I hit 3rd gear, (my 11 year old son grins when he sees his 67 year old dad burning rubber, priceless). Never waxed it, rain rinsed only, has scrapes, scratches, chipped paint, small dents, and bare metal exposed, but has no rust! The bed and body are both galvanized with heavy metal. I do change the oil and filter every 3 k miles & lube about every 10k miles. Often when inspecting under the hood I bez thinking this PU may outlast me. Never broke down, very dependable. and going on strong.

gmc,sonoma,2003,Will, 07/27/2018,Great truck and looks good too!,5,"I am very happy with my ZR5 package truck that I have had for about a year now.  It drives great, shifts smooth, and handles very well.  As with everyone, the 4.3 has a lot of power but terrible on gas.  I know people complain about the acceleration but this is a OHV designed engine so that is to be expected plus it is a truck! I love the amount of customization you can do to this thing, and it drives great on and off road.  The looks are awesome, you don't see a lot of the crew cabs around so its nice to show off when everyone else drives the same boring standard trucks (tacomas, colorados, rangers) you see now.  The big issue  I have had so far with mine is the ABS control module since the solder points were not done very well on it, easy fix though.  I do oil changes every 5k and transmission fluid and filter every 15k.  Currently going on 190k miles and still starts up every time and runs like a champ.

gmc,sonoma,2003,St Louis Ex Owner, 01/28/2005,Very unreliable truck,1,"Just traded this piece of junk in for a Nissan pathfinder, hopefully I have better luck with the new vehicle.  I don't know where to start.  To begin with it was in the shop more than on the road.  First it was the blower motor, then the transfer case, then the brakes (all under warranty).  Finally when it was out of warranty the ball joints in the front which was $500 at 39,000 miles.  Enough was enough so I am through with this money pit.  Thank god.  Sad thing is this was the first vehicle I really tried to baby."

This car has been driven only 17000 Miles and transmission started losing oil. The power steering makes noise and the car runs rough on turns. This is my second GMC car and the last  one. I hate cheap workmanship, crappy design and horrible engineering. How can a well maintained car (by dealer every 3000 miles) has to have transmission problem after only 17000 miles? Please save yourself a lot time/money and buy a decent car and I urge GMS to send their designers to Honda or Toyota for through training.   "

I dont drive it much at all, just to school or town or what ever so there's only 40,000 miles on it. Its the funnest vehicle to drive off roads and on jeeping trails, the 4wd is great for winter too. my only regrets are that i have had to put in a good deal of money to keep it running up to par.  it seems as though every year i have to change wheel bearings and the cab door has been giving me problems for the last few years. Its a tough little truck and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a great looking fun truck to drive."

Dealers cannot find and fix the shaking and the wandering on these vehicles and are denying a problem even exists. It appears the frames or the design of these vehicles are in question and appear to drive very unstable down the road. Not all Denali's have this problem but there are a lot that do. I feels like you are driving down a bumpy road when the road is not. read the forums at http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com I can deal with the paint problems on the console and the Speedometer issues and all the cosmetic stuff, but I cannot deal with the real problems like bad welds in the frames and the wobbling down the road.

the front driver side heated seat quick

worked through a dealership and they 
have taken care of everything with no

On another note, the ride is great.  It 
is a Cadillac ride without the car

I looked at Cadillac Escalade  the high price tag. Will the real truck maker please stand up.The Denali was the better buy unless your hung up on the wreath and crest. It is like traveling on your favorite couch. So the gas mileage isn't the greatest but its worth every mile of what it cost.

I drove with a feather touch, and watched the economy meter regularly. On the hwy, I only used Cruise control for maximum gas mileage. With all my attempts, these are the best numbers I could do. I was so upset (and embarrassed when asked by friends what my mileage was on my new Yukon hybrid), that I sold it at a huge loss.  Better to get it off my back now than later.

I bought this car last weekend because of the employee pricing, that did away with the proclaimed ROI that all the web sites said for the price make sense. Wow, what a car! I put over 400 miles on it in town, which would have equated with two tanks in my Expedition. When I did fill it up it was 15.00 cheaper than my Expedition.

Driving under normal conditions (acceleration and braking), I am averaging just 16 mpg, or less. The sticker on the vehicle said EPA Estimate of 20 City/20 Hwy (However, the fine print says ""16-24 depending upon driving conditions"" (paraphrasing), which give GM a great deal of flexibility, while disappointing the buyer!

Have also had to take it to the dealer twice for brake issues.  Covered under warranty, but still a hassle.  Interior is laid out nicely, but materials seem really cheap.  Driver's seat has great leg and head room, but comfort of seat is lacking on long trips.  Overall, pretty happy with it.  Has a very good ride even at 75-85 MPH.

The hybrid takes some getting used to--it sounds like a golf cart when starting out.  After considerable research, we replaced a 4WD Tahoe and the difference in the mileage is startling and pleasing. We anticipate the difference between the conventional and hybrid will be obliterated in three years or less because of the gas. The interior is comfortable although the seats are harder than the older Tahoe.  We took out the 3rd row of seats (not getting them was not an option)for more storage on trips.

The hybrid system, and instant economy display really encourage you to drive light-footed, and I have never been light-footed until now. It is a hoot to drive - the hybrid system is virutally seamless in transition, and the V8/V4 cylinder deactivation system works really well.

There is simply nothing else like this truck in its size/weight class."
gmc,yukon-hybrid,2008,Frank, 06/26/2009,Love the truck,5,"bought the 2008 Yukon used  in 2009 with only 1500 mile on it. What a truck! Averaging around 21.7 and I have a prtty heavy foot. Very Happy with the truck, getting better gas milage than my BMW x3 with a weak six cylinder."
gmc,yukon-hybrid,2008,Ewc, 09/07/2020,Best SUV I have ever had,5,"I have maintained my Yukon since purchasing it in 2008. I now have a little over 200,000 miles on it. The battery pack was replaced about 125,000 miles. The transmission has been outstanding. The key is not to fool around with puting additives in the transission. It should be sealed. The engine has been soild. I use Mobil 1 long distance motor oil and still change it when i hit 20% oil usage left. Fuel mileage  has ranged from 20 mpg to 28 mpg on the open road. I ran an experiment  between Albuquerque to Santa Fe and back. At 80mpg i got 20.8 mpg. I ran the course again holding my mph to 65. I got 24.5. To San Antonio  round trip i will average around 23.5 mpg. It varies based on driving conditions, habit and how much ups and down hills. I plan on hanging on to my Yukon. It has been so goid to me may family and dogs. Lol. Great vehicle.

gmc,yukon-hybrid,2009,Tom Young, 09/10/2009,Good Choice,4,We did our research on a large SUV which could accomplish the flexibility in travel and towing. Along with the gas mileage for our family. After extensive research we felt the premium paid for the Yukon Hybrid was the choice for us. It is a superior family vehicle for city pick up and delivery of children and a great vacation transport.
gmc,yukon-hybrid,2009,alex170, 04/22/2013,So disappointed,2,"I bought the Yukon new in 09 thinking the hybrid would save me some money on gas, well it did not preform nearly the way it was proclaimed to.
It seemed to be cheaply built.
The remove-able 3rd row was almost unusable as they were so heavy to put back in that it took two people"
gmc,yukon-hybrid,2010,JRW, 06/01/2010,First Time GMC Buyer,4,"Quiet, comfortable ride.  All you would expect from a full size SUV.  Getting right at 20mpg, so again for full size SUV, can't complain.  Packed with features and absolutely beautiful exterior.  Interior moves easily from an executive vehicle to an off the road partner."
gmc,yukon-hybrid,2011,txdenalihybrid, 04/22/2015,2011 Denali Hybrid 4x4,3,"There are lots of things I really love about this truck but also many things that leave you scratching your head.  This truck really only seats 5 adults.  The third row is totally unusable for adults.  And the second row is really only for shorter people.  Not having a spare tire is very scary.

This thing tows great- No issues towing 9,000 lbs and you really can't even notice you are towing.

Hybrid system does not work logically (always kicks off at 12 mph so very little benefit to it at the stop light.)

Overall, I love this truck but it's exaggerated fuel efficiency, illogical third row of seats, lack of a spare tire (and place to mount a spare tire, almost makes this a no go."
gmc,yukon-hybrid,2012,mattharrisa, 11/19/2011,"Best truck ever owned, great off road but no hummer",4,"I love this vehicle .I got 13 city mpg in my previous all wheel drive 2005 denali and consistently get 19 city mpg in my Denali hybrid 4 wheel drive. I get about 20 mpg highway now vs 17 mpg in previous non hybrid Denali .
I frequently go off road and had my doubts about the 22"" wheels but hasn't presented a problem, although I'm not pushing it off road.
I do frequently ford a wide river that I need to cross to
Get to my cabin up to about 18"" water depth in 4 wheel drive, but won't attempt it at higher water depths. I usually ford about a foot of water with absolutely no problems. I have 22,000 miles with no problems except having heated seat replaced under warranty. "

lotus,elise,2005,mark Greenblatt, 03/28/2006,2005 Lotus Elise,4,"Anyone who is serious about sports cars should put this car on your short list of cars to test drive. I have had 4 Porsches, much more expensive than this car, but I will never go back to Porsche again. They are so boring and bland compared to this car. A purchaser of this car should be aware that it is one of the most raw cars for sale. Raw meaning it has a loud engine (1/3 of my reason to buy a car is the sound it makes), the interior is spartan with a lot of exposed chassis metal (which I think looks so cool), it is a simple car designed to have balanced handling and performance, low weight, and will give you grins every time you get in it. It has a Toyota drivetrain to boot."
lotus,elise,2005,WC Kelly, 06/24/2008,Lots of Bang for your Buck!,4,"This car is a true head-turner.  There is absolutely, positively NO other car that competes with the Lotus Elise in either looks or performance for the price.  An absolute PLEASURE to drive, this car will give you a perma-grin.  I have parked my Chrome Orange Elise next to cars costing twice as much, yet the crowd seems to gather around the Lotus.  If you are shy, this is NOT the car for you, unless, perhaps, you are looking to come out of your shell.  This is an excellent car for for women or men with small feet, as the pedals are located close together.   It is certainly not the most graceful car to enter and exit... (don't wear a skirt ladies!)  All in all a fantastic car to drive!"
lotus,elise,2005,dk, 12/21/2009,Pure Fun,4,"If you just want to have kick butt driving fun, this is your car.  Don't expect posh comfort but do expect the most fun that you have ever had driving a car.  No cup holders but then again, it would spill anyway.  You will also become a minor celeb as people will take your picture, and will follow you all over the place.  It can actually get a little annoying but once again, fun.  No matter what other cars on around you, you will become the focal point.  I have had mine for 4 years and I still love to just look at it.  The temptation to drive too fast is overwhelming but it looks fast just parked so you get over it.  Fantastic car."
lotus,elise,2005,JohnRocket, 06/04/2007,Dump your Ferrari!,5,"Having owned virtually every dreamy sportscar imaginable (yes, I HAD an Enzo), this car is BY FAR the greatest thing that has ever happened to a sunny Sunday morning.  Though tough to get into, once inside, you get a comfortable driving position, phenomenal fuel economy, unfiltered communication from the car, and the most pure ""street legal"" driving experience.  Plus, the added benefit of very low cost of ownership, and not worrying if something is happening outside to your Lambo/Ferrari while it is unattended, be it valet or street- parked.  Plenty of fans on the streets, but more are curious of what it is, rather than what it costs.  Very cool, very fun."
lotus,elise,2005,Bill, 02/11/2006,Like nothing else,4,"I've had the car for 9 months and can't rave about it enough.  I've had my experiences with other exotics and this car just amazes me every time I drive it.  My Ferrari is just a memory! I can't believe we're fortunate enough to have this genuine hard-core exotic sports car in the US. The build quality is excellent, especially for being hand-built. I have had zero trouble with it and it never fails to bring a smile to my face. If you live to drive quickly and efficiently then this car is for you. "
lotus,elise,2005,lotus racer, 09/23/2005,Track this car... please!,4,"Unbelievable, but my wife bought this car because it looks great and she lets me take it to the track.  Drives like a race car because that's what it was built to do.  Take a racing class if you've never done such a thing.  Then take the car out and have some fun on the track.  But don't try this on the street.  You'll get squashed like a bug when you move fast into the blind spot of just about any car and every truck. Hold on to your seat because you've never had a ride like this before."
lotus,elise,2005,Paul, 02/05/2006,The most amazing car I've ever owned,3,"This car is absolutely amazing. It handles like no other street legal car you can buy. I looked at Porsche, BMW, Corvette, Ferrari and others. Handling-wise it blew them all away hands down. In a straight line there are faster cars but nothing handles and connects you to the road like the Elise. It's a true drivers car. This was not intended or designed to be an everyday grocery hauler. If that's what you're looking for, buy something else. But if you want the real ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" then the Elise is it."
lotus,elise,2005,RedElise, 02/15/2006,Unbelievable Ride,4,"Clearly this car is not for everyone, but if you are under 6'0"" tall, 200 lbs, and have a size 10 or smaller foot then this is a tremendous amount of fun.  It is extremely difficult to get in and out of (words cant describe it), but there is nothing out there that handles like it.  The stereo is poor, but usually you have the top off and you are listening to the purr of the engine behind your head.  This car really lives up to all the great magazine reviews it has accumulated over the last year."
lotus,elise,2005,Jerry, 12/13/2006,Nothing else even similar,4,"This car is such a total departure from any other street car that I'm shocked it made it to production, much less DOT and EPA certified. The car is so light, rigid, and responsive to input that the driving experience is simply not comparable to driving anything else.  The noise and ride aren't as harsh as you would expect and the driving position and seats are excellent. 30+ mpg. Terrible radio and alarm. There is a rattle in the gear box the dealer says is not normal but they won't do anything about it. Fit and finish are pretty good for a low production hand built car requiring unconventional materials and manufacturing processes."
lotus,elise,2005,JK, 02/17/2007,A True Weekend Racer,3,"The Elise is certainly not for everyone.  It is not a luxurious vehicle, a daily driver (for most people), or extremely powerful.  However it is very unique, very light, very fun, relatively affordable, reliable, and pure!  This car weighs 25% less than a Mazda Miata, and maneuvers precisely.  The steering car is very communicative, through its steering, ride, and pedals.  Because of its light weight and low center of gravity it sticks to the road like glue.  The engine isn't too powerful, but it is reliable with Toyota's 1.8L VVTi engine.  At 6 RPM the VVTi kicks in and the car pulls very hard to redline."
lotus,elise,2005,Ken, 09/11/2007,Lotus Experience,3,"Back in the sixties when I was driving MGBs and Triumphs the car that stood out for me even then was the Lotus, particularly the Europa.  This was a car that a true enthusiast would want. I never did get that Europa but, finally,in my later years, I was able to get the new Lotus Elise (an 05).  The car has been a joy to drive and its handling and braking rival that of any sports car at any price.  I can't count the number of times people have approached me with questions about the car and how much they liked it.  I have had complete strangers come up to me and ask me if it was OK to take pictures of the car.  The car has been a true driving experience, unlike any other sports car."
lotus,elise,2005,Erich, 11/26/2007,Wow!,4,"This is a car only for those who love to drive and KNOW how to drive well.  This car will outperform most everything out there with the exception of some super cars.  It is not for the driver who wants creature comforts... not a cup holder, climate control, heated seat to be found. This is essentially a street legal track car.  The cool thing is that you can drive her to the track, put on your helmet and eat up a 911, Miata, Cobra, or what ever else gets in your way.  Then have a nice drive home.  I use mine as a daily commuter for a 110 mile round trip.  It makes the drive fun and economical.  "
lotus,elise,2005,Sal , 10/17/2007,Sold for a better car,3,"I owned the Lotus Elise for about 7 months. I enjoyed the car and thought that there was no better car for the same price. Then I test drove a Honda S2000. Every feature that the Lotus lacks the Honda makes up for it. more horse power, higher RPM Redline (9000RPM) and the handling is just as effective. 0-60 time is a little bit slower but 0-100 time is quicker and thats really what counts in my book. Lotus was okay but the S2000 beats it in speed and handling. "
lotus,elise,2005,Jud, 09/06/2008,WOW!,4,"I purchased a 5,700 mile Magnetic Blue Elise on eBay, during a hurricane.  Once I finally got the car, I never wanted to get out, and did but only to sleep (although I did sleep in the Elise on a long trip and found the high sills to be an excellent perch for my feet as I spread out across the cabin).  I cannot explain the fun, the performance and the economy in running one of these fantastic machines.  At some point every gearhead must own one.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  I may have to sell to buy a Ferrari but it is only to get more luggage space.  Yes, a Ferrari can be the mature choice; but you have to start in an Elise."
lotus,elise,2005,Magnetic Blue Elise, 09/10/2008,One wicked car!,4,"Bought this car 6 months ago and have the only complaint of driving it too much! Nothing has gone wrong so far and I do my own oil changes with Mobil 1 5w40 synthetic oil. On curvy roads it's unbeatable. Me and my friends with fast cars (08 evo, 05 vette, 04 G35 Coupe, 04 STI) go cruising on local back roads and none of them can keep up with me. Try taking a tight turn on the hwy at 130mph... this car can do it! Has a very unique design that is eye catching for all ages!"
lotus,elise,2005,JLElise, 12/02/2004,Exhilerating,4,"Picked up the car 2 weeks ago.  Performs exceptionally well.  Handles like it's on rails.  Very quick.  Comfortable driving position.  Exterior styling is second to none.  Interior is a bit sparse, but, heh, it's a sports car.  Amazing how many ""thumbs up"" one gets!!  Can't wait until the spring and do some real, open air motoring."
lotus,elise,2005,Raymond, 12/21/2004,"Best sports car, period.",5,"Pure performance, adrenaline pumping, and fast, real fast.  After driving the Elise, the Boxster feels like a sedan...  The Elise gives you a unique experience that is hard to put into words.  It is a fun car, not for daily driving since the suspension is hard (race-tuned) for fast curves"
lotus,elise,2005,Dion, 01/12/2005,Elise,4,"Wonderful car to drive, if you are realy into driving and enjoy track days. For the price this car has no equal. The Elise puts a smile on my face every time I drive the handling limits are so high It is impossible to explore on public roads, realy is a wonderful track car. I can't believe Lotus deprived us of so much fun for the past 7 years."
lotus,elise,2005,Adrian, 01/31/2005,Purest Sports Car,4,"This is absolutely the most fun to drive car in the world. All around performance acceleration, handling, stopping are all remarkable.  It's also a beautiful work of art to sit an stare at. A true Exotic car at a bargain."

lotus,elise,2005,Miguel Parra, 02/11/2005,Yes I did put a 10 in confort,5,"Most people think this car is unconfortable, specially in the ingress/egress, but every person that gets in and out of my car comes out with a big smile on their faces.  Rating this car as a driver car makes more sense to me so I do give it a 10 in all aspects. No other car can comunicate the road to the driver like the Elise does."
lotus,elise,2005,SP, 02/14/2005,Pocket Rocket,4,"Really a fabulous sports car package: lightweight, fantastic performance, Kart like handling and high tech construction."
lotus,elise,2005,larry, 06/11/2005,proud to be a member of this elite club,4,"if you want a car unlike anything you've ever seen or driven before, this is it. If you are shy and introverted and do not want to draw attention to yourself, this is not your car. It stands out in the crowd of cars 3-4x more expensive. It is very quick and handles better than any other car i've ever driven. getting in and out with the roof on is initally a little challenging, particularly if you are tall. It was definitely worth the 17 months i had to wait to get it."
lotus,elise,2005,chris murphy, 12/28/2005,great car to drive,4,the Elise is the most fun car to drive I sold my Ferrari 308 gts 3 weeks after i got my elise and the elise is a better made car and handles like a dream.you get more looks in the ferrari and is a lot easier to get in and out of but not as much fun to drive
lotus,elise,2005,Chris, 03/26/2006,Fits like a tailored glove,4,"An awesome handling car.  Sometimes it seems the car anticipates what I am going to do.  The biggest problem I have noticed with this car is all the attention you get.  Sounds like a cool thing but try changing lanes rapidly (you will understand if you drive one) to get set up for that nice curve you want to accelerate through and you can't because all the cars around you are slowing down to figure out what type of car you are driving.  Not to mention wanting to run a quick errand and being stopped by everyone as you exit the car asking how fast, how much, can I ride (women love this car)....  Just buy one, you won't regret it. "
lotus,elise,2005,Jim, 08/20/2006,Great Car,4,"I purchased the car with the idea that I wanted a fun car with a performance bend that I would get good gas mileage and be a good everyday driver.   The Lotus met my needs! It's a lot of fun. While it gets good mileage, the small tank needs frequent refills. The interior size is something you have to experience to understand.  Once in, it's very comfortable.  Highly recommend the car!"
lotus,elise,2005,German Elise Driver, 07/07/2004,Fun toy but rain not allowed,3,"Great fun. BUT - rear tires last only 
5000 miles, water in cabin when 
raining, VERY difficult to get in or 
out with top up. GREAT FUN on twisty 
roads, but every bump felt. Had to cut 
hole in undertray to repair muffler, no 
access from above.

Summary - great go-kart in good weather."
lotus,elise,2005,wade lee, 09/11/2004,get one before it's too late!,4,"it's hard to overcome paying $6000 over 
msrp to drive one off the lot right 
now, but i did. and no regret, it's 
worth it, the fun factor, the attention 
and the sense of haha, look at me i 
have one while you still waiting. "
lotus,elise,2005,Walk, 11/08/2004,Good Times!,4,"Wow!  Unlike any car I've ever 
driven.  Fast, fun, great engine, and 
awesome looks!  Not a car for those 
who don't like attention.  This car 
keeps a 4 foot wide grin on my face.  

You feel very connected to the road 
and there's no need for a radio 
because it's more fun to listen to the 
engine and the car as it reacts to the 
road.  

I still can't get over the fact that 
Lotus was able to get this car into 
the US.  After all, the US is the home 
of the giant SUV and a small, 
responsive, light weight roadster is 
such a welcome breath of fresh air.  

If you want one, you better contact a 
Lotus dealer to get your name on the 
waiting list.  Waiting stinks, but for 
the Elise, it's worth it."
lotus,elise,2005,Frank C. Robles, 12/15/2004,Lotus Value,3,"Great performance. Very difficult to 
get in and out."
lotus,elise,2005,Tim, 08/07/2005,"Must have toy of the year, poor service",4,"This car feels like all Porsches should feel -- elemental. Best handling car that I've ever driven (all Porsches, BMW M3, S2000, 348, 355, 360, Corvettes, etc). Must get it while you are still young enough to climb into the cockpit!"
lotus,elise,2005,Mike, 11/22/2005,Mountain Drive,4,"This is my daily driver.  The handling is unbelievable on the narrow mountain roads in Western Virginia.  It is the best handling car that I have owned.  Interior is scarce, but more comfortable than it looks.  Takes some time to get use to getting in and out of, especially with the hardtop on."
lotus,elise,2005,JimmyJoe, 01/15/2006,So Much Fun It Must Be Immoral,4,This car is a no-compromise toy that can be used to actually get you from one place to another when that's what you need. The main thing though is that it's obscenely fun to drive. Others have said it before and it's true: The Elise is a perfect combination of jumbo-sized go-cart and wannabe race car. And it's so fantastic looking that people can't help but smile and comment and ask about it. The only real problem is everyone is always looking at you.
lotus,elise,2005,jkbrill, 01/17/2006,Perfect Sports Car,4,"This car is so fun to drive.  This vehicle makes everything else I have driven seem like a RV.  The car handles, brakes, and looks like a sports car should.  The ride is surprisingly good; however the Elise is not a daily driver.  However, it is an amazingly fun toy, that is well constructed for a handmade vehicle.  It is also pretty zippy, and loves high rpm's."
lotus,elise,2005,rob, 01/28/2006,A big go kart for the street,4,"This car is all about the handling.  It has the most direct steering response car I've ever driven.  The interior is spartan, but has everything I want, good track seats, radio, AC/heat, and a fun 6-speed transmission.  It accelerates very well, but at freeway speeds cars with 350+ hp will finally get their edge.  The handling, acceleration and braking are all helped thanks to the car's lightweight design, 1984 lbs."
lotus,elise,2005,Mike C, 10/25/2009,This car begs you to drive it HARD,4,"I cannot state how happy I am with this car.  It rewards the driver at every level.  This is my first high performance sports car, and initially behind the wheel I didn't know what to expect and drove it very conservatively.  It rewarded me at this level and drove very easily.  As my sports driving skills have grown, I find there is continuously more ability in this car.  As I learn to exploit it's performance more, it shows me it has more to give.  So far I have not found the bottom of this tall glass of fast and agile!  My wife loves driving it too, and she was previously not a car enthusiast.  That has all changed.  You will fall in love with this car!"
lotus,elise,2005,rbalboa, 11/05/2004,"Best sports car, period.",5,"This is a pure sports car, no frills 
just raw power in a small package that 
will shake you up with a great smile."
lotus,elise,2005,zleduc, 05/22/2004,GOOD CAR,4,"This is a really reliable car! Fun to 
drive and makes everyone go wild."

lotus,elise,2005,Vance, 06/10/2005,Lotus Elise 2005,4,The car of my dreams.  It's really a fun car to drive and the sexiest car on the road today.
lotus,elise,2005,tra, 08/12/2005,Extreme Toy,5,Just an extreme fantasy car - nothing drives like it. Nothing handles like it.
lotus,elise,2005,Robert Hoar, 08/15/2005,"""Grin""",5,"If I were to get a vanity plate for this car it would be ""GRIN"".  It is so much fun to drive that I come up with the most ridiculus excuses to take it out. The car is beautifully engineered, very well built, and handles better than any car I have ever driven.  And it has show-stopper looks!  The Elise makes all but the most exotic cars look ""normal""."
lotus,elise,2005,Kat, 08/29/2005,Kat's Toy,4,"Much more than I ever expected.  Waited a long time for it, but more than worth the wait.  So much fun to drive, it's hard to get anything else done.  Cornering is unlike any other car or motorized vehicle I have ever driven. "
lotus,elise,2005,Eric, 09/13/2005,Colin Chapman LIVES!,5,"What a stunning car- Lotus has really done a super job with this Elise. It's a very evolved car to be used for one purpose: driving. Whiners looking for more room, more features, more whatever-  hey, there's an Acura dealer just around the corner from your house. Paraphrasing the words of Mr Chapman, more power is faster in the straightaway, less weight is faster everywhere. Hee-YAH!!!! "
lotus,elise,2005,Tom, 09/22/2005,Dream Come True,5,"I had anticipated a great car, but was unprepared for how wonderful the Elise is to drive. I've driven a Fiat Spider for 15 years, so I'm already used to the usual array of sports car quirks. This car has none of those. Aside from the way you have to enter the car (sliding in backwards and swinging your legs over the high door sill), it's a pure joy. As I say, ""It's a little hard to get in. It's impossible to get out."" Things like a reliable starter and 29.5 mpg combined so far make this car the perfect way to go for me. It's my every day driver -- in two months, I've put 2000 miles on her already!"
lotus,elise,2005,rayenet, 10/21/2005,Simply Awesome!,4,The most incredible exotic car under $50K.
lotus,elise,2005,MattB, 12/13/2005,Awesome Car!,5,If you are looking for a weekend sports car with no compromises- this is it!
lotus,elise,2005,Les Albin, 05/18/2006,Lotus Elise,4,"The Elise has been absolutely reliable in all types of driving.  It has looks and performance that compare favorably to the most exotic cars around, but at a fraction of the cost to purchase and operate.  Handling and responsiveness are better than any other car regardless of price.  On the track or on the street the Elise gets more smiles per gallon than anything else around."
lotus,elise,2005,Daniel Dudak, 06/15/2006,On Rails!,4,"If you want to be removed from the road, to be lulled into comfy oblivion, don't buy this car.  If you want to experience the raw thrill of the road unlike any other street-legal vehicle, then this might be the car for you. Yes, it can be difficult to get in and out of, but like a pair of racing gloves or shoes, you don't really ""get in"" the car, you ""put it on"". "

lotus,elise,2005,Eliseiak, 10/29/2004,The Driver's Masterpiece,5,"How can the Elise be described other 
than as the best handling, most fun 
piece of art on the roads. Not only is 
it one of the most beautiful cars 
available, it can't be beat for smiles 
per mile. It hugs the road in the 
curvy bits and settles right down on 
the straights. It is surprisingly 
comfortable to drive for long days, 
after three 500+ mile days, I still 
wanted to get right back in her and on 
the road again. This car is worth 
every penny it costs and every day you 
wait for it to arrive."
lotus,elise,2005,Leno, 11/10/2004,"Ridiculous handling, awesome reliability",5,"Unless you have track driven much more 
expensive world class sportscars you 
can in no way begin to appreciate the 
value of this car. Amazingly is 
doesn't grow uncomfortable, and the 
Toyota drivetrain is bulletproof, 
proven, durable, servicable, and 
torquey. No downshifts required. And 
the exhaust note is second to none. 
I'm not sure how they get that throaty 
roar from a 4 cyl, even my M3 with a 
Remus didn't sound this good! Don't 
know why I got the MP3 player, I'd 
rather listen to the engine. Rides 
suprisingly well, road noise not bad. 
No buffeting at any speeds with the 
top off. No room for storage but who 
needs it, and this much fun is 
reserved for small people, or you'll 
bump shoulders."

driving returns with the new Elise.  
Colin Chapman's ghost would be ecstatic 
about this newest Lotus.  Lithe, with 
spectacular handling, unbelievable 
weight to power ratio, beautiful 
sytling. And all for far less cost than 
either a Boxster or a Corvette.  No 
wonder I remain an Anglofile!"
lotus,elise,2005,April G., 01/15/2005,Cooler Than I Thought,5,"I had no idea....this car is so much 
more fun than I thought.  I have a very 
active lifestyle, and driving has 
always been something I just had to do -
 until now. Now I LOOK for reasons to. 
I love being first ""in line"" at the red 
light, so when it's time to go, I can 
red line it through the first couple 
few gears before I bring it to an 
acceptable and legal speed. :-)  I get 
so many looks w/ this car.  When I come 
back to my car after parking somewhere, 
inevitably there is more than one 
person crouched over looking at ""my 
girl"".  (I've had people actually take 
pictures of her on several occasions, 
which one of you ""Big Boys"" can say 
that?)
Good decision buying this girl, she's 
uniquely mine"
lotus,elise,2005,Jay, 02/09/2005,Remember what it's for...,4,"The Elise is a pure, unadulterated 
sports car. It does not try to be 
anything else. It is one of the fastest 
street legal cars, and handles arguably 
better than just about anything else on 
the road. It's form (all the vents are 
real and needed) is functional - you 
can like the look or not, but there is 
nothing extra, e.g. a big rear spoiler. 
That it manages to do this for under 
$50K is stunning.
It does this by sacrificing weight (e.g 
size,gadgets, electronics, ""comfort"" 
stuff) and by designing to the best 
ergonomics once you are in it. My Elise 
puts a grin on my face every time I 
drive it, and feels as comfortable as a 
glove. Complaints about cupholders, 
ease of entry, etc. miss the point."
lotus,elise,2005,Tom, 04/23/2005,Handles great,5,"Tired of feeling like you are driving your living room sofa around? This car handles great and gives more sense in being in control of the driving situation than any car I have ever owned.  You feel connected to the road, and the ride is not bone jarring.  The car can go from 0-60 in under 5 seconds and still get over 30 mpg on the highway.    "
lotus,elise,2005,Brian, 06/18/2005,"Ubelievable fun, not an everyday driver",4,"I have had a lot of sports cars, and this is the most fun pure sports car I have ever owned. If this would be your only vehicle I would not recommend it. Ride is very stiff; daily potholes into the city may rattle your fillings out.  But as a toy, there is no more fun to be found for under $100,000."
lotus,elise,2005,bryan conlee, 07/20/2005,111R,5,"I am very impressed with the performance and build quality for this low production, hand built, semi- affordable automobile.  The interior is a bit Spartan, but it's really all you need.  This car is meant for driving enjoyment, not cruising in the lap of luxury.  Ingress/egress is a bit tricky, but once inside, the car fits you like a glove, and the seats are surprisingly comfortable.  The stereo leaves something to be desired, but that is minor and can be changed.  The exterior design is one of the most beautiful ever dreamt up, in my somewhat biased opinion.  Performance is incredible, even with its mere 190HP.  I plan on enjoying this car for a lifetime..."
lotus,elise,2005,John, 07/30/2005,Amazing.,5,"This is my third Lotus, and they have done an excellent job with this design."
lotus,elise,2005,Joel, 08/01/2005,Cheap at Twice the Price,4,"I have the Sport-track model of the Elise.  This car is for people who want a RIDE, not transportation. Having said that, though I have an additional car that I have put only 200 miles on since getting the Elise. To be blunt, driving any other car is just a chore. I can't keep a smile off my face when I drive this car. People should have to pay an entertainment fee just to look at it!"
lotus,elise,2005,seven, 08/21/2005,Elise,5,I am thrilled to own this car.  It is fast and gets looks constantly. 
lotus,elise,2005,jonf_so_fla, 09/16/2005,rocket w/ 2 seats,4,"i have had the car for about three and a half months, and i enjoy it just like day one! purchased new, now over 10,000 miles, runs like day one. small rattle in drivers door, front speaker grills needed to be replaced the dealer has been great! all performance and fun! my other car is a surburban 2500, guess what i drive most days. i ordered and waited for this car a year and a half, i would do it again!"
lotus,elise,2005,dave jackson, 09/20/2005,Fun to dirve,5,"The Elise will make Colin Chapman smile .Lotus is back and better than ever.This is our 4th Lotus (after a ""real"" Dodge Daytona, with all its muscle. The Elise is reminsecent of our Europa Series 6, but is mnuch better constricted, with much better performance and much more striking beauty.  I have never driven a car that handles this well, combining sub 5 second  accelleration with ultra-responsive handling and eye turning beauty.  One does have to take care getting into the car, especially if you are tall like me. But once in driving position, it is quite comfortable.  The air conditioner works here in Florida. All in all, the value and fun quotient for the Elise is unmatched anywhere"
lotus,elise,2005,Stewartbp, 12/20/2005,Lotus Experience,5,"The car continues to amaze and thrill me.  The control and power combination is unequalled.  I have not had it on a road track yet but I'm looking forward to it in the near future.  This is not the modern sports car.  Spartan and no frilles interior, but I didn't buy the vehicle to live in.  The Consumers Report review of this vehicle must have been done buy some soccer mom, so I have lowered my expectations as far as their reviews.  A must drive vehicle, if you can find a dealer that will let you test drive one."
lotus,elise,2005,Chris D, 03/30/2006,Way Too Fun,5,"Driving this car is very comparable to riding on a roller coaster: same sensations going around curves and accelerating, an occasional hard bump, etc. Other ""sports cars"" seem pointless in comparison. Best toy I've ever owned. It makes me feel like a teenager again. Beats other exotics more than twice the price in many ways. Love the body lines and the handling. Absolutely a blast to drive."
lotus,elise,2005,larry, 05/27/2006,my 2005 Lotus Elise,4,"Handles better than any car I've ever driven. Excellent brakes. With top off, easy in and out but requires a good back and knees to get in and out with the top on. Air and heat work great."
lotus,elise,2005,Zack Jones, 01/31/2007,Lotsa fun,4,"I have felt the need to have the dealer do the service which tends to be expensive.  I was involved in a minor accident (not my fault), but the repairs were extremely expensive.  That said, it really is fun and will turn heads and have lots of people asking what it is and how much it cost."
lotus,elise,2006,jhill, 01/21/2007,Best Sports Car!,5,"I have been an owner of five Porsches over the past 14 years.  I have driven a 968 convertible, '86 911 Carrera that had a race suspension and performance engine, '98 996 S w/turbo body, '03 997 turbo and a '06 Cayman S.  All of these cars were amazing and unique, but the Lotus Elise is truly the ride I have been looking for.  Yes it is not a Porsche uni-body design and it does lack German engineering, but the feed back and handling is so much like a race car it is truly awesome! The light weight chassis design along with the independent suspension makes this vehicle very unique. For the driver that wants a sports car experience, Lotus is as close as you can get to driving a formula one. "
lotus,elise,2006,KH, 09/29/2006,Simply sublime,5,"My first car ever purchased, and I would have it no other way.  I test drove the Cayman, 911, Corvette (base, not Z06) and had a Z3 in college, but this car blows all of them away.  After driving it, I knew I couldn't pass. I live and work in Malaysia, but was home in the US for 2 months over the summer and took that opportunity to purchase this car and drive from Houston to Chicago overnight to drop it off with my family. 1000 miles in 15 hours was a breeze; I felt very little discomfort the entire trip.  My only pain was from my left arm resting on the door sill for hours on end. But for the thrill of driving a car with this performance and still getting 28 mpg, the discomfort was worth it."
lotus,elise,2006,CC, 10/12/2006,The Ultimate Rush,4,"This car is amazing, BMW calls their cars the ""Ultimate Driving Machines"" but this car truly is, no other car comes close. I bought this car to drive to and from the track, and on weekends. After owning a 1986 BMW 3-series track car, two highly modified VW GTI VR6's, a 2000 Audi S4 with over 400hp, and a 2003 Mini cooper S, and I currently own a 2006 Infiniti G35 Coupe as a daily driver, and I've driven several Porsche 911's, but the Lotus is bar-none the most exciting sportscar I've ever owned. I race shifter karts, and it seems like that's the only type of machine anyone will ever out-handle an Elise in! Plenty quick stock but Forcedfed 275 turbo kit is going in when the warranty runs out."
lotus,elise,2006,Brian , 11/08/2006,1st Month with My New Lotus Elise,4,"This is definitely a car for the person that likes to get noticed, and enjoys performance and handling.  I bought a black Elise with a hard top and the neighbors thought I was driving the Batmobile.  If you want a car that has a fun factor of 10+, it's a no brainer; however, it is a bit of a challenge to get in and out of, and if you're a large person, or over 60, I'd say, don't even try to get in and out of it.  Braking and acceleration are great.  Love the exhaust sound as your driving.  Beware, it's an attention getter!  For people with large feet, it may pose a challenge to operate pedals, I have to wear certain shoes when I drive as the pedals are close together."
lotus,elise,2006,Ian, 12/04/2008,Very fun car with some drawbacks,4,"This car was built for the track. If you buy this car expecting anything more than a driving machine, you are looking at it for the wrong reason. The combination of aluminum and fiberglass that make up the Elise provide a very high power to weight ratio, even with the very small 1.8L Toyota engine.  After pushing the car past 6200 rpm you feel a boost in power as the car switches to the second cam. As you redline in second at 8500 rpm, the shift into third pushes your head back into the seat. At this point you realize that you're on the freeway inching toward 100 and need to slow down. What a killjoy.  Amazing handling and road hugging tires make freeway on ramps the best part of your day."
lotus,elise,2006,Ryan, 05/29/2009,Best Attention Getter,5,If you choose to buy a lotus Elise you are also making a commitment to people wanting to know what it is. I have seen more Ferraries and Lamborghinis than lotuses. That truly makes this an exotic car. It sounds like a formula one car under an over pass!  This truly is the best bang for your buck you can get.  Touring and sport packs are great! Worth the money.
lotus,elise,2006,Clint, 05/31/2010,This car is sick.,5,"Instant celebrity status, whether you want it or not.  You will begin getting gas at night just to avoid all the questions and strangers chatting you up for 20 minutes. I have learned more about the car from others than I knew before I purchased it.  It is alarmingly quick to 100 mph and I have not had one problem with it.  Not one, ever, an extraordinary feat for a hand-built vehicle.  The interior is simple and clean, with only the essentials.  The high RPM power is addictive.  I would equate driving this vehicle with how a great white shark must feel swimming along out there, knowing there is nothing out there that can touch him. Lotus is ahead of its time with 30 MPG and iPod hook-up!"
lotus,elise,2006,ME, 08/21/2006,I'm stuck in this car,4,"Had a little trouble first getting into the car.  I haven't actually gotten out yet for 2 reasons.  First - this is the funnest car with the best response and road feel that I have ever been in, really making me NOT want to get out.  Second - I physically can not get out of the car.  I'm typing this on my wireless laptop that I threw in the passenger floor board.  If my wife reads this, please come help me get out.  By the way, I am NOT fat at 5'10"" and 160 lbs."
lotus,elise,2006,B, 09/03/2006,You'll Love It!,4,"I just purchased my 2006 Elise three days ago.  It has the touring pack, sport pack, hardtop, metallic paint, and Starshield.  I have already put on more than 500 miles and here are my thoughts. I am 6'1"" and about 200 pounds and I fit quite well in the seat.  Yes, getting in and out is a pain, but well worth it. Power and handling cannot be beat.  Love the exhaust note and power curve. Can't wait to get out of the break-in period. Interior storage is minimal, but the net and shelf behind the seats can hide many little items. The exterior looks and shines like no other. My previous car was a Porsche Boxster S and it felt like a Buick compared to the Elise. Get it, you'll love it!"
lotus,elise,2006,mikeebear, 08/13/2007,Don't judge. It's better than you think.,4,"This car is amazing. It is like a street-legal road rocket. A race car. A go-kart. It's so fun to drive. I have driven faster cars, but none more gratifying than this. And it's no slouch either! Once you're inside, it's pretty cozy and roomy. Easy to get comfy in. I have never been in a car that garnered so much attention. Every day I get compliments, questions, comments, and non-stop looks. I don't imagine that Ferrari owners get nearly this much attention. Take this car to some twisty back roads and the magic will come to life. That is where this car belongs and that is where you will have the most fun with it. It's no dragster and if that's what you want, move on, this car isn't for you."
lotus,elise,2006,ACURAMAN, 12/20/2006,Finally a car to replace the Acura NSX,4,"The Lotus Elise is the most pure sports car experience on the road today. I have never driven a car that is more responsive to the touch than this one.  It is as though this car is an extension of your mind and body. It is a blast to drive at high speeds through twisting, turning roads, passing muscle cars with 500 hsp plus motors that simply cannot hold the road. My last toy was an Acura NSX and after test driving Corvettes, Porsche 911's and BMW's I thought I would never find a car that would touch the NSX. Just as I was losing total faith in finding a replacement for the aging NSX it was announced that the Elise was finally coming to Canada! In the true Campbell tradition less is more!"
lotus,elise,2006,Brandon, 02/20/2006,A real race car for the road,4,"Probably the most fun car I've ever driven and owned. Holds to road like super glue and tar combined. Steering is quick and light and you can move with the flick of a finger. Hard top is easy to remove and very light since the car only weighs about 1900 pounds which is less than a Mazda Miata. Soft top can be removed in a matter of seconds and rolled up to fit in the trunk. There's enough room in the trunk for enough stuff for a weekend trip if you go alone. It's tough to get in and out of this car, unless you take the top off and jump in. Interior is simple and basic and comes without all the non-sense some cars bring. Overall a great value and the most fun I have ever had in a car."
lotus,elise,2006,Mackspane, 02/16/2007,Bang for the Buck,4,"In 1998 I was finally established enough to buy a nice new car and purchased a Boxter and I enjoyed it, but 8 years later, after only 22,000 miles, it died. In 2006 I was looking, quite honestly, for the best bang for my buck.  I'm single and don't drive much and never used the back seats in my old cars, so a 2 seater was ideal for me.  Upon seeing the Elise I was sold. In Chili Red with the Sport and Luxury upgrades, I purchased a 2006 brand new and it is quite literally the most amazing car I've ever owned. Between beauty, performance, and even reliability (with the Toyota engine), this car blew and still blows away anything from twice the price on down. It's truly an awe inspiring vehicle"
lotus,elise,2006,Joe, 03/30/2007,9000 miles in an Elise,4,"A fun car that takes a little getting used to. Getting in and out for me, 6 foot 2 inches, 205 pounds was a little tricky at first, but now feels normal, taking about 2 weeks to adjust.  Driving the Elise is tons of fun and manuevering it is easier than any other car I've ever driven. It is very forgiving, especially for a RWD sports car. Over rough roads or on long trips (with the stage II exhaust fitted) the Elise is definitely not at home. You will feel every bump and the drone of the engine will likely wear on you.  Nonetheless, the Lotus is an amazing car, even as a daily driver. There is nothing on the market that comes close in performance and looks for anything near the money."
lotus,elise,2006,PT Abbott, 06/30/2007,LOVE,4,"It's nearly impossible to get into with the top on, almost as bad with the top off. But once you're in it getting out doesn't matter, you just want to stay in it forever.  No better bang for the buck, most attention getting car ever owned, and I've pretty much had them all.  A street legal race car that makes you SMILE SMILE SMILE.  There's no better handling, braking or accelerating car on the market, sure some go faster in a straight line, and some may brake a little better, but nothing else has the package the way this car does.  God bless Colin Chapman, may he rest in peace, his legacy lives on and on and on."
lotus,elise,2006,chapman, 05/19/2008,"Pound for pound, $ for $, best deal",4,"I have owned a number of other so called sports cars over the years.  I went through a Corvette stage, a Viper stage and a Porsche stage.  Pound for pound and dollar for dollar no car can touch the Lotus Elise for pure fun, driveability and performance.  Yes it doesn't have a 600 hsp engine and yes it doesn't have a 6 figure price tag but take the Elise out on twisty winding roads and watch the power cars eat your dust."
lotus,elise,2006,Rugbyduck, 07/15/2006,Elise 06 Review,4,I have found the Elise to be quite comfortable for extended trips.  Where the 05 falters in poor seats and poorly spaced pedals the 06 makes up for.  I've never driven a car that puts a smile on my face for so long.  It's like having a new toy everyday of the year for the rest of my life!  Dealer cooperation leaves a bit to be desired.
lotus,elise,2006,John Grage, 01/05/2006,Fast and Fun,4,"An absolute true sports car. Not only all show but more than enough go. Tight interior that holds you snug for those twisting roads that push you to the limits. A real eye catcher, lots of looks and plenty of camera phone shots on the road. A bit of trouble entering and exiting but well worth the effort. Excellent power to weight ratio. Not quite a vehicle for winter conditions, which makes one pine for summer."
lotus,elise,2006,Lee, 08/25/2006,First 1200 miles,4,"I own 10 vehicles, including a 2003 360 Ferrari, 2005 Ford GT, 427 Shelby Cobra 1965 kit car, 1999 911 Porsche cab.  Each car has strengths but the Lotus is a hoot to drive on a shoestring.   My model is a Sport with a sport muffler.  The power is good but takes higher RPM to get performance; the flickability of the car is outstanding.  Gas mileage (who cares) is high 20's.  The sport muffler is too loud in my view but sounds aggressive.  My dealer has been awesome."
lotus,elise,2006,Steve, 09/28/2006,Best experience ... LOL!!!,5,"Have owned many other performance cars including Porsche, Ferrari, Lambo...etc.  This is just an honest race car for the street.  I have a touring pack, sport pack, with two tops.  The only complaint is that I had to index the tires to stop a high speed (120mph+) shimmy when I bought it. Big deal.  I had to do that in the Ferrari and Porsche 996 GT3... it's not uncommon.  Just ordered the Turbo kit from Force Fed to bring the hp to 275 from 190.  Does it need it?  Not really...it's just more fun to be had.  Car handles stock better than most prepared gt3 cars.  This is the best ""bang for the buck"" out there bar-none. "
lotus,elise,2006,ALLAMAN, 06/12/2006,Almost Perfect,3,"Do not buy this car if you are looking for comfort.  The Elise is a purpose built machine. The purpose is sublime handling, which is evident on any backroad or cloverleaf.  This handling could not have been achieved if the car were packed with (heavy) luxury features.  The seats have no padding and getting in/out of the car requires advanced yoga training.  You should only buy an Elise when performance is the ONLY thing that is important to you.  I love my Elise."
lotus,elise,2006,JSC, 01/06/2006,Electrical nightmare,3,"Fun to drive, but hard to get into the car even with my height 5'7"".  Second day after I purchased the car, had a fuse blow up and electrical problem occur so very disappointed with all the excitement only to last one day."
lotus,elise,2006,Phil, 02/15/2006,Awesome,4,This car is awesome. It handles well and it's a thrill to drive.  Even though the gas mileage isn't the greatest it's worth it.
lotus,elise,2006,Patrik Lori, 03/31/2006,Patrik,4,"Driving and ownership experience with this vehicle is superb. The power of the small 1.8L engine fits excellent to this super light car. If you don't need really all the silly comfort from today's cars, and just look for free driving experiences, it is one of the best car to drive with. Forget Porsche just drive Lotus."
lotus,elise,2006,pw378, 05/31/2006,Dream car...,5,"This is the most exciting, exhilarating car I have ever known.  My daily commuter is a BMW Z3 that I really like, but compared to the Lotus Elise, the Z3 is about as exciting as a 1960's Volkswagen Beetle.  From the body styling, to the acceleration and cornering, this car simply cannot be beat by any car under $150k.  If you love driving, get this car!  Sell everything you have if needed, but this car is not to be missed."
lotus,elise,2006,mms, 10/31/2006,Pure Sports Car,4,"In sum... a Pure Sports Car. Don't come looking for luxury or comfort, but that's not to say it isn't perfectly comfortable for 1+ hour commutes. Couldn't be happier with the performance and handling.  Had to upgrade the stereo. Also must watch out for potholes and steep inclines. Great fuel economy... it's working out as our only car (for now).  "
lotus,elise,2006,Adam Horak, 02/12/2007,new car,4,WOW is all I can say! Looks outstanding drives amazing.
lotus,elise,2007,fishman76092, 11/12/2012,Nothing else compares in the price range,4,"I've had mine for about two years.
No issues thus far.
Hear some build quality complaints on forums- its hit and miss.
Its a hand built car that costs $25-40k.

The good:
Closest thing to a race car for the price, Toyota engine/transmission, so much fun to drive above 5500 rpms.

The bad:
Getting in and out with top on, people looking at you- wanting to take photos, etc, not many creature comforts.

Long story short:
If you want a smooth ride, a great stereo, isolation from the road, and a long trip cruiser...buy something else.
If you want to enjoy every mile, drive a roller coaster, rip through the gears, wind it up to 9k, turn the stereo off and listen to the engine, buy an Elise."
lotus,elise,2007,tbd, 08/28/2010,Beware,2,Beware! I bought mine brand new and only put on 2200 miles per year. When the car was one week old the headlight flew out. The radiator hoses have blown 3 times stranding me on the side of the road. The build quality is terrible. Good luck going up-market lotus! People paying six figures for a car will not tolerate these issues.
lotus,elise,2008,csrvices, 06/23/2008,If You Want to be Different,4,"If you do not fit in the same common human mold like most folks do, then you may want a different kind of car... consider a Lotus Elise if you want to be truly in touch with the road while plying the power and handling of your vehicle to it.  The Lotus Elise built like no other vehicle I know of for the consumer market.  Lotus has taken years of specialized racing builds turning their experience into a well built, well tuned, well heeled and well, a good-looking automobile that can turn heads and flat dust the next Guy.  It is a race car built for the street, Lotus has produced a competent vehicle, a workhorse that wants to run hard as a different kind of daily driver."
lotus,elise,2008,perfectpant, 04/12/2010,Sling shot,5,"Look, if you want the best handling car on Earth today, buy it. If you want the best fun on road buy it, if you want a family car skip it. If you do not want driving enjoyment skip it. After owning 30 cars, trucks, sport cars, the Lotus is the best sport car ever build. Consider performance, price, economy, driving. I'm 6'2"" 184 lbs and has no problem to get in and out. Most Ferraries the same. I also have the F 430. The Lotus I can drive every day, but not the F 430.  "
lotus,esprit,2001,Owner of 2003 Esprit, 08/28/2003,An Owner's Review: 2003 Lotus Esprit V8,4,"Frightening fast car, difficult to 
drive slow. Don't mean b/c u ""want"" to 
drive it fast, I mean b/c IT wants to 
drive fast. The gas pedal is either on 
or off, as is clutch. Brakes similar, 
risk a face plant if not careful to go 
gentle on pedal.  Not easy to drive, 
but has its rewards. Downsides: (there 
are several), forget about getting it 
if you are shy, everyone WILL react to 
it, sometimes positively, sometimes 
not. This leads to things that weigh 
on your mind. As in, can I just park 
this car anywhere?(ans: no). Do I need 
to plan my trips? (ans: yes). The car 
nose is unbeleivably low. Remember 
this is not a Porsche911, it is a 
supercar."
lotus,esprit,2001,Dirk989, 06/17/2003,Esprit V8 is a winner,4,"While not a well know marque, Lotus has 
produced one of the top supercars in 
the world.  Handling has been described 
as the greatest ever.  I don't 
disagree.  Performance is unbelievable, 
especially with a few reasonably priced 
mods.  This car will glue you to your 
seat and handle curves at speeds 
previously reserved for video games.  
The styling is not as outrageous as 
otherrs, but this is a car that looks 
much better in person than in print.  
Beautiful, exotic, good fuel mileage, 
unbelievable performance and handling 
for a fair price.  The only flaw is 
that the interior, while very well 
made, is that of a typical British car -
 small and tight."

lotus,esprit,2002,tim hayden, 12/24/2007,over 3 yrs ownership,4,"I have driven it daily for over 3 yrs and has been extremely reliable. I am so use to people making double takes when they see it on the road that it feels strange on the rare occasion when it does not occur. The performance is way beyond what I can explore and the exhaust note with the center exit U.S. exhaust is phenomenal and sounds only like exotic european cars can. The interior is very intimate and memorable and feels very nice once settled in.  I think the exterior is one of the most beautiful, exotic shapes to date and still looks modern after all these years.  I have owned Porsches and Ferraris and this is the most satisfying car yet. Don't be scared to take the plunge and get one."

interior is gourgeous in tan and the 
wheels are the most beautiful I have 
ever seen.  The twin turbo 
acceleration is the best I've ever 
driven and the exhaust is pleasantly 
loud.  Major service is maybe $1200 
and was $5000 on the Testarossa. Other 
accessories and parts much more 
reasonable also.  I am using as

lotus,esprit,2002,Jer, 07/05/2003,A Real Review,5,"In my opinion as a long-time Porsche 
owner I can make an honest comparison.  
I feel that from 1998 onwards the 
Esprit is a very usable and reliable 
car that is even more fun to drive then 
then nearly every Porsche, Ferrari 355, 
corvette and a viper.  I have had 
nothing but pleasure without any 
headaches.  Keep care of the Exclusive 
Lotus and it will keep good care of 
you. From reading some reviews, it is 
painfully obvious that the ratings are 
performed by individuals that have 
never owned any of the cars but just 
had an hour or so of driving."
lotus,esprit,2002,mikel, 03/29/2002,Italian flair meets British panache,4,"The Esprit is an icon among exotic sportscars. It's limited production numbes ensure exclusivity and first rate personal support from the manafacturer.

It has fantastic looks, and is now very reliable which is significant in this car class, second only to the NSX I would say.

The car has superb handling which requires some getting used to as it's uncluttered by electronic traction control gizmos. It can easily out perform the NSX, 911. Against the Ferrari 360 it's a close affair. 

It is surprising comfortable on long journeys although getting in and out can be cumbersome. So for returning your videos you might want something else. Then again it's worth the trip !"
lotus,esprit,2002,Abuser, 04/23/2002,Outdated,2,"Esprits are sorely in need of a

keep up with cars half there price,

lotus,esprit,2004,jbrookstone, 02/20/2006,Musclecar in Exotic Clothing,4,"Only 33 2003.5-2004 Final Edition Lotus Esprits were made and shipped to the United States.  Equipped with a turbocharged 32-valve flat-plane crankshaft V8, they start, idle and sound very much like a '60's era musclecar with a hot cam.  Exhaust note is very good from a low grumble at idle to a roar under acceleration.  There is almost no turbo lag, tons of torque above 2000 rpm allowing the Esprit to easily burn rubber in its first 3 gears.  Steering is very, very fast and precise - plus the turning radius is exceptionally tight. Cockpit space is adequate for those under 6 feet and trunk space is surprisingly generous. Handling is outstanding, as in all Lotuses.  Front spoiler seeks bumps."
lotus,evora,2010,mkovalsky, 01/28/2011,Best Lotus Yet,4,"A Lotus you can actually live with everyday-the interior is all leather and fits together properly, no squeaks or rattles.
Instrument cluster is perfect and the touch screen stereo/navigation works well.
Lotus even made it easy to get in and out of, relatively speaking.
Handling is second to none, it is like driving a larger Elise.
Interior is quiet under normal driving and you can actually hear a phone call using the built in bluetooth.
Exhaust note is quiet at low rpms but becomes a fantastic wail at full throttle.
Handling in the wet is scary at best but it has incredible grip when dry.
Absolute head turner, expect to get a tremendous amount of attention everywhere you go."
lotus,evora-400,2017,Steve Meeks, 01/14/2018,Lotus Evora 400 Red with Black pack,5,"The 2017 Lotus is not only an eye catcher but it has complete drivers feel. The car is larger and more roomy than other Lotus models. I have the manual transmission I wanted back to drive a true sports car. I have owned Porsche's and the new Porsche's have lost the fell of the road and the fun of driving the same as the new McLaren. The McLaren is beautiful and fun but the new models take away again that sports car feel. I have 3000 miles on the car and use it as a daily driver I have only had the car for 2 months , no problems. The Toyota supercharged engine has plenty of power and the shiftier is very easy to use . The clutch has  a very soft feel I prefer a clutch to be a little stiffer but you have to look at the general public. There are very few autos today who give you driving pleasure and the true feel of the road that is why I went back to Lotus, driving excitement and simplicity in a great sports car.  Update review I now have 15673 miles on the car and it has been trouble free . My wife likes riding in this car rather than the Porsche she feels more comfortable riding in the Evora 400. This spring we took a trip to Idaho 2600 miles round trip and no problems, everyone we met on the road asked about the Lotus due to its limited production. Last week a 911 wanted to race us and the Porsche was no match for the Lotus. The Porsche has 370 hp and 285 lbs of torque at the crank where the lotus has 407 hp with 350 torque at the wheels from a dyno machine. If you are looking for a true sports car with precision and balance then go with the Lotus. If you just want to be seen in a Porsche and pay more money for less handling and higher service costs then buy the Porsche.  This car is great on country roads where driving sport cars are fun if you just drive around town then the Lotus is not for you. Up date the car is still magnificent,. Drove the car to twin falls Idaho and so many people commented about the car and no problems a more comfortable ride than the Porsche 911. I just traded this car in for a new lotus gt. The car held its value on the trade and the new lotus gt is incredible

lotus,evora-400,2017,steve m, 01/16/2019,Players special 410 Lotus,5,"This car is my second Evora this one has the IPS automatic due to my wife wanting to drive the car. The handling and performance of this car is amazing. We have friends who have Porsche's and corvettes and they can't believe the cars power,  handling, and a lot less price. The Lotus looks good and gets a lot of questions since this car is not produced in large numbers. If you are thinking about a pure drivers car then you should drive a Lotus before other sport cars. The new Porsche is not he same it handles like a puffed Buick. Service costs are less than my Mustang and Porsche 3 years free maintenance. Alpine stereo system  is better and more responsive than the corvettes. Save money 84k have fun and better driving enjoyment drive a Lotus. Yearly update still love this car if you are looking for a street and track car combination then look at the Lotus.The Lotus has more horsepower than a carerra,and better handling and performance. People will have to get used to the IPS transmission in that there is no hesitation in down shifting or up shifting.You get instant results unlike most automatics where the consumer wants smoothness you lose rpm the Lotus keeps the rpm's up and you don't lose performance. This car is my daily driver and pure driving enjoyment.If you are a true driving enthusiast you will love the Lotus if you don't want to improve your driving skills and experience then buy a corvette or a Porsche where the electronics and computers are there for you. Lotus cars are meant to be driven not, 55 in a 70 like corvette owners.

lotus,evora-400,2017,RacingGreen, 08/13/2019,2 years later,5,"I've owned this car for 2 years.  Everything you've heard or read about how much fun this car is to drive is true. I didn't find a better driver's car for my money when I bought mine and now they are coming to the used market.  In the long run the 400 has proven to be a good buy for me because I like driving it so much.   The 17s look like the good deal  

My car has not cost a penny in repairs although I have had to use the warranty.  Not much different than other cars I have owned, and better than any BMW I've had.   I wouldn't hesitate to take it anywhere and have done three 1500 mile road trips, two with my wife.  Very comfortable, works far better than you'd think on the slab and knocks it out of the park on fun roads.   I pretend it doesn't have a rear seat and just enjoy the extra cargo space.
 Features?  I don't need a complicated car, just the usual.  Nav, proper HVAC, comfortable seats, tight construction, no shakes or rattles, supple ride, great steering and handling.     You have to really enjoy driving something unique more than you do auto dimming lights, power seats, the latest tech, and a sumptuous interior. The interior suits the car's purpose but it is not sumptuous, although I like the generous use of leather and everything does what it is supposed to do.   The interior looks like it was indeed hand stitched in England  in another era.     It charms me and it is a pleasant place to be by any measure.  

Keeper. 

My spec: manual, racing green over tan leather, forged rims, std. Alpine, rear view camera  and subwoofer and factory ppf.  It's all I need

lotus,evora-400,2017,Chris Waggett, 09/22/2020,Lotus Evora 400 is #forthedrivers,5,"I have a 2017, white over red Evora 400 & it’s a simply brilliant car that is my daily driver during the Spring-Summer-early Fall; I absolutely luv driving it.
Placid below 3000 rpm, it comes alive above 4500 rpm, with sensational steering and incredible handling. Nothing comes close to it as a drivers car. Nothing!
The engine note is delightful, the seats, controls & stereo work as required, but nothing distracts from the total driving experience. Every drive puts a smile on your face.
A Lotus spoils you and no other car comes close, irrespective of the price.
If you want to pose, go a Porsche, Ferrari, McLaren or Lamborghini. If you want an involved drive in an utterly absorbing car, go Lotus.
Reliability is better than my BMW X5, servicing is cheaper too, as are the running costs.
It’s the best kept secret on the market and is rarer than anything, being known only to drivers who know and they acknowledge you with thumbs up and smiles wherever you go.
If you don’t test drive one you’ll never know how much your missing out!

lotus,exige,2006,XEEEJ, 03/22/2006,An Amazing Car - But Not For Everyone,4,"The Exige is an amazing machine.  Steering feel, braking & cornering are all phenomenal.  The car is also beautiful to look at while being functional.  I love mine, but prospective buyers need to know what they're getting.  The car is not for everyone and you have to be willing to deal with its total impracticalities.  It's basically a 4 wheel motorcycle.  The car is best used on twisty back roads or on track.  Commuting or highway cruising is a waste, in my opinion.  You have to accept the attention that the car draws.  It's a surprisingly comfortable car once inside.  Ingress and egress are tricky but get easier with a little practice.  Nothing comes close to an Exige for the money. "
lotus,exige,2006,Al B Bach, 05/21/2006,"Exige, Mighty Mini Supercar",4,"Exige will take you're breath away. Not a practical utilitarian car by any means. This car car is designed for one purpose: to be driven on back twisty roads where the adrenaline flows through your veins. This is a ""me"" car that spells out individuality with F1 roots. This car is for serious drivers in a small niche track drivers, car enthusiasts and those that want pure performance without killing the pocket book. From its 150lb chassis to the hand layer fiber body it is definitely worth the wait for an order to be processed for the US market. I waited since 2004 for mine since the first US announcement for ramp up in Nov 2005, delivery was Feb 2006. Only 300 made and I'm glad I got mine."

lotus,exige,2006,jeff pearce, 03/08/2007,new lotus owner,4,"I researched this car for a while before I bought it. The car is fantastic to drive. The interior space is comfortable but yes it is somewhat spartan. However, it is a sport car and not a luxury car. The acceleration is crazy fast. The feel of the car while driving is like being part of the car itself. I have the upgraded stereo and the touring package so I can listen to great music and smell the wonderful scent of leather. Imagine a smooth ribbon of highway, the sun on your shoulder and your hands wrapped around a machine that is capable of unleashing a fury of raw energy and you are in command. This car is worth every penny and the few negatives, like high maintenances charges are worth it."
lotus,exige,2007,"""Mr Lotus""", 07/30/2008,EXIGE S - PURE RACER,4,"My 2d season with the '07 (1st year) Exige S. This is a pure race car on or off the track and is built around acceleration, handling and braking - it is arguably the best handling car on the road.  This is why a strong driver who knows the car's capabilities can win over other high end cars both American and European.  It must be understood that to arrive at the final equation of this car's performance there entailed certain cons built-in.  But you must maximize the car's capabilities to overcome its modest top-end when competing with other racers.  And get a Valentine 1 or be prepared to get multiple tickets or -- be prepared to ditch the 5.0 as the ol' chap found out last night - not rec. "
lotus,exige,2007,AZExigeS, 06/18/2007,The most fun on four wheels,4,The 2007 Lotus Exige S is very quick and handles like its on rails. The only other car I want is a Pagani Zonda. My comments: do NOT buy this car if you want luxury. There is hardly anything inside except bare aluminum. Buy a Cayman S instead. DO buy this car if you are a real enthusiast and intend to take it to the race track on the weekends. This is a race car built by a company with Formula One heritage.
lotus,exige,2007,Exige_S, 07/02/2007,Take It To The Track!,4,"This is it. THE car I've wanted for so many years. I've had everything from a '68 Shelby GT350 to a '66 Sunbeam Tiger, even a pair of '02 Miata SEs, but this car shines above them all.  The control you have is beyond anything else on the street. It's not the fastest or quickest car, but it feels like it is. It even looks fast sitting still.  Everyone wants to race, talk about, touch or drive it and lots of people take pictures of it.  Even kids love it.  It's one of those cars that kids of all ages get to ""drive"" in video games, and when they see it on the street it's almost as if you're looking at a Matchbox car.  It has race-car looks but you can drive it on the street... AND the track!"
lotus,exige,2008,SanDiegan, 03/11/2008,Street Legal Race Car,3,"This is my second Lotus. My first was an 05 Elise with 190bhp, a soft top, and standard (""Touring"") suspension. My new S240 could not be a more different car. This Exige is serious business. The acceleration is spectacular; when you get on the throttle the supercharger sounds like a jet engine and you quickly become one with the driver's seat. I really enjoyed the handling and cornering of the Elise, but the Exige S240 with the Track Pack is not to be believed. The capability of this car to corner hard with minimal body roll is unlike anything you have experienced before (including 360 Modena's and Gallardo's that I have driven)."
lotus,exige,2008,Al B, Bach,And I thought my N/A Exige was HOT!,4,"Well, this is the second Exige I've bought and for those that thought  the S version was hot in 07, this limited 240S for US release in 08 is just outstanding. I'll put this simply, this is the street version track car. Not much has changed overall, unless you count the interior is redone, has the launch capability, better, bigger brakes, 4 piston calipers and (gasp) a cupholder! Now, I didn't think that Lotus could improve the Exige, even with the superchager in 07. I waited since my first one was the first release without the SC. I was going to buy the track version, but heard that I should wait. I'm glad I did... so worth it! This Exige is is the BEST! Words can't describe the feeling"
lotus,exige,2009,DM, 05/25/2009,"Great Track Car, If You Can Fit",4,"This car excels on the track - fast, great grip, tight steering.  This car would be difficult on public roads given the small size, hard suspension, and low center of gravity.  The small engine works very well in a car this light.  However, it can be very loud and a radio is not going to help.  I am 5'6"" and find it very difficult getting out of the car.  For serious racers, this is a great all-around package.  No creature comforts."
lotus,exige,2011,scm6079, 04/07/2012,"Incredible car, may be the last car like this ever",4,"The Exige is an amazing car that Makes you forget about any shortcomings when you take the next corner.
Mine is not a daily driver, and although I love the car there are days you need to carry passengers and cargo.
This car is incredibly light weight and a type of car I fear may be dissapearing forever as cars continue to grow in size and weight and even lotus themselves is talking about transforming into a Ferrari competitor with much heavier cars.
 Although cliche, this car really is a useable go-kart for the street."

maserati,ghibli,2014,Jason S, 10/13/2017,"Budget Maserati sound, handling, and performance.",4,"If you are looking for all the excitement and panache of a Maserati, but on a tighter budget, you will be very pleased with this vehicle. If you think you have somehow stumbled across a $150,000 car for half price, you will be disappointed. On the used market, these cars are a great buy, but don't expect the hand crafted interior of a Bentley. A high end Italian sport sedan on a budget has to have compromises, and they can be found on the quality of materials, Chrysler sourced components (the nav interface is actually quite good, albeit cheap looking), and lack of high end features. The driving experience however, is all Maserati with one of the most intoxicating exhaust notes I have ever heard. The power, sound, handling, brakes, and overall performance are everything you would hope them to be. Let's be honest, a major reason for buying the car is the name, and I can say it does get just as much attention as you would expect. When it's time for service, do your self a favor and take it to an independent, although the aftermarket parts market is all but nonexistent. Hopefully this will change as more of these cars reach a mature age and numbers increase. While I think this car is tough to justify at the new price of competitors, it is truly a great buy on the used side and the chance for the average guy to own a real Italian exotic super sedan.

maserati,ghibli,2014,Ari, 11/05/2016,FEAKER,5,"WYSIWYG.  Not bad at all.  There is considerable lag when you punch the gas, unless you pre-rev it.  The power is, however, astonishing for a car weighing over two tons.  Comfort is better than many snobs acknowledge, as are the controls.  I have hit nearly 30mpg on the highway at 80-85mph over distances, so the fuel consumption is better than expected.  The handling, even in rain or snow, is very good.  Obviously, it looks great.  I have not had much in the way of maintenance trouble, though there have been a number of recalls (fixed for free).  The pain job is unfortunately susceptible to dings, especially on the hood, and Maserati to date has not offered any touch-up paint, so one would need to get a clear plastic protector or periodic paint jobs.....The bluetooth is not the best, as it is much better in cheaper cars like Acuras.  It requires much effort to set up, and the quality is not the greatest either.

maserati,ghibli,2014,johnfsteph, 12/03/2014,Perfect lease car,4,"I've had my car since mid October 2014 and so far no major problems. The car drives really nice and the exhaust is fantastic. My only complaint are the small rattles in the car. Nothing too big, just a little annoying.  I am confident the dealer will resolve when I bring it in for service..."
maserati,ghibli,2014,Chuck Easttom, 04/10/2015,Wonderful Car,4,"I always drive upper end cars and trade every 2 years...I think I will keep this one. It is great to drive and feels wonderful. I have had Jaguars, Cadillac's, Mercedes, even a Bentley Continental...but the Ghibli is a sublime combination of Jaguar performance with Cadillac comfort and Bentley curb appeal."
maserati,ghibli,2014,Kingsley Ozoude, 02/22/2015,Still Not Impressed,3,"I have had my Ghibli QS4 since July, 2014. The car has the worst 'upgraded' radio of any car most readers of this review has today. The dealer replaced my amplifier but the problem persists. The airflow to the floor is terrible, comes out mostly at the windshield. That they also don't know how to fix. The seat belt clip is low that it takes spraining ones back just to click the seat belt. The car even would not start on 2 occasions, embarrassing! It's a shame that since 1914, Maserati has not figured out these seemingly simple things. If you have more than $75K to spend, you better spend it on a car with luxury and performance. I own high end BMW, MB, Porsche, AUDI. Ghibli is a disgrace.

In addition to the above, none of the above issues have been resolved. I now have a few more years of driving this car since my last review. Unlike other new, high end cars, it would be nice if adaptive cruise control, touchless homelink and touchless start could be incorporated into the vehicle. Most of these could be done by computer updates, I have since bought a new Tesla Model X. Only a nimble car company will survive in the future. 

The car still has an awesome engine and braking system, but that's about it. I will not buy this car today!

I almost forgot that there is NO good way to charge your phone or other electronics because it does not have a charging USB port and the cigarette lighter receptacle is too shallow that I have literally tried more than 8 different ones and none of them fits well. Even something as simple as that is beyond this mess called a car! I took it to the dealership and they had no solution.

This is an update on August 28th 2019. None of the issues listed above has been resolved to date. I still will not buy this car today based on the competition that is out there. Only the engine and the braking system are still the great parts of the car. Everything else falls seriously short.

maserati,ghibli,2014,Fernando Mazzoni, 06/09/2016,My worst luxury car experience,2,"If you are looking for a reliable car, this is not the one. Don't let you drive for the awesome exterior design. 
In six month has been 4 times at the dealer because of several issues. They said the car has 400 horse power. My mistake was not to ask what kind of horses were those. Looks like they are hungry small ponies. The fuel consumption is insane for what you get. Forget about acceleration. I had a Diesel Porche Cayenne before and that was really fast. I've paid for an upgrade for the sound system ... the sound is worst than a cheap Korean car. The quality of the screen for the rear camera is the same one I got with my old Commodore 64 in the 80'. If you want to buy something to drink do not expect to find a cup holder where your drink will fit. 
The mats are going to be wherever they want, the clips are not going to hold them. Sits are design to drive short distance. Diver sit couldn't be more uncomfortable. If your plan is to travel and leave the car in the Garage, make your trip shorter than 3 weeks otherwise you will need a battery charger. 
My advise...with this money you fill find sever other options better than this one.

maserati,ghibli,2014,Sam K., 06/01/2016,2.5 Years in and I've learned my lesson,2,"I've been an S-Class owner for 15 years, but decided that I wanted to go small. The Maserati Quattroporte was a looker, but I was familiar with its issues. Hence, the Ghibli made a lot of sense on paper. Price was right, size was right, looks were right. Ordered the car without knowing the price. When it was delivered, my word it was like the first time I saw an R8, it was gorgeous. However, after owning it, I've found it to be a Chrysler in an Armani suit. 

The transmission is clunky and slow in comfort mode, but too aggressive in sport. It'd be nice if there was an auto mode to filter that issue. The car is TOO LOW. It scrapes everything. For a mid-size sedan, why must I treat every incline like a Ferrari. A lift-system is necessary. The brakes are the most sensitive and inconsistent I've ever felt. I thought that my A8 was difficult to modulate, but this Ghibli is another animal. Lastly, the maintenance....it's a sub-$90k car full optioned, so why is the maintenance the same as a Bentley. You'll be paying easily $1,200 for an annual maintenance. Save yourself the money and purchase a proper German vehicle..unless you enjoy teenage boys taking pictures of your car wherever you go. 

That's my two-cents.

maserati,ghibli,2014,talegadr, 06/12/2015,Stay away from Maserati,1,"I have owned a Maserati Ghibli Q4 for the past year. As a 53 year old man who has driven many luxury cars in the past, my word of advise is to stay away from this car. I have never experienced so many problems with a car as I have with this one. And it's not only the car, their costumer service is absolutely ridiculous. I get a lot more service from the Toyota dealers than the Maserati people. Save yourself a huge headache and maybe a suicide note. Stay away from the name Maserati. "
maserati,ghibli,2014,drdom80, 04/03/2015,No all weather tires???,3,"I leased the 2014 Ghibli and what they neglected to tell me is that it doesn't have all weather tires. You need winter tires and summer tires. If the weather drops to 50 degrees or below, the tires sense the cold and cuts the fuel to the engine causing a severe ""bucking"" feeling when pulling onto a main road from a stop street. Masserati isn't doing anything about this issue and they have been the worst customer service company I have ever dealt with. I would not recommend Maserati to anyone. I call to speak with someone and all you get is a voicemail or they are always in a meeting.  If you leave a message you're lucky if they call you back. Horrible customer service.  
"
maserati,ghibli,2014,Pier Barattolo, 04/26/2017,Don't waste your money!,1,"We leased a Ghibli 2.5 years ago worst mistake we have ever made - the car has had endless recalls, spends more time on AAA truck being ferried to the dealer and at dealer than us driving it.

We had issues with the gas pedal where it would get stuck and suddenly accelerate at full throttle - nearly got killed. Totally unreliable.

No one in the house wants to drive it, not even my 17 year old!

Maserati USA washing its hands of it because they keep fixing whatever goes wrong with it, and it is always something else!

Total waste of money, would never drive one again. You should think twice before parting with your cash.
"
maserati,ghibli,2014,Doug, 02/10/2016,Nice Car But Expected More,4,"The car is a beautiful design and it comes at a fair price point. However, at the same token, I expected a lot more for the price. I traded in a 2012 Merceds-Benz C300 4Matic and the Mercedes had more reliable features than the Maserati! And aside from the power of the Maserati, the performance of the Mercedes was comparable (and much less costly). 

I do hear a slight rattle at time in the front that of course the dealer can not replicate. Additionally, I hear a ""swooshing"" sound at all speeds (perhaps this is the Turbo intake but it is distracting and seems a bit odd to me. Dealer denies any issues found). By far the worst feature on the car is the Garmin navigation. It is horrible! It often just shuts off (very annoying when in the middle of finding where I am) and resets. Literally happens at least 4-5 times in a one hour trip. Never had a single time where it did not do this. Horrible. The Mercedes GPS - 100% reliable, 100% of the time. 

I understand most cars are going to this but the lack of a hard copy user manual is a bit frustrating. The Sirius radio also does not have as many available features as I had on the Mercedes. 

All that said, it is a head turner and I really like the design and it does not give me much trouble. Would I buy one again? Probably not, but again it is not a terrible car.
"
maserati,ghibli,2014,KED, 11/22/2017,THE BEST SOUNDING Chrysler you cant afford,3,"Pros: Sounds Great, Has Maserati badges, big trunk, decent front seats.. EVERYTHING else is a con. $11000 repair because a bolt on the sub-frame connector broke because the car is so low. $4800 brake and tire job. Ive had 4 alignments in less then a year. The customer service is brutal unless you pay out the ass for their premium customer service. I CANT WAIT for this lease to be end. It would take an INSANE deal for me to even entertain the thought of getting another Maserati and even at that it would only be the Levante. This is not a good everyday driver. The minute there are more than 2 people in the car it bottoms out when you hit a rock. The Front end constantly feels like its on ice skates. If you are willing to spend the money go for a German car OR even an import. Shoot I would go as far as saying get the Genesis 90 over this car.
"
maserati,ghibli,2014,csperling, 02/18/2014,I love the performance,4,"I love the sleek and sexy look of the car....performance is incredible and sound is amazing...it ends there...
...inside the vehicle you would not expect to find the following lack of quirks and lack of details from the manufacture; THOUGH HERE THEY ARE: constant rattles from the glove box, dashboard, rear doors, windows and
rear seats. Window seals inviting in the open road air in as you drive. The worst sound system I have ever had in any vehicle. Car floor mats which are of the lowest quality I have ever had.
The CHEAPES PAINT ""MICA' which scratches if you blow on the vehicle too hard.. 
Even with all of the above conditions, driving the vehicle is still a pleasure and an art.

maserati,ghibli,2014,lordselkirk, 10/15/2014,My Favorite Car Ever,5,"We've had our Ghibli for over seven months now and absolutely love it!  It is everything we expected and more.  There has not been a single second we've regretted the purchase.

This car is just what we wanted - very sexy inside & out, very fast (easy to hit 100 without knowing it!), and very comfortable. The shape excites my eye, the leather smell excites my nose, and the sound excites my ears.  It is a joy to walk out to this car each day."
maserati,ghibli,2014,Alex, 08/22/2017,waste of my money,3,"I leased a Maserati Ghibli SQ4 in 2014.The first week this car developed electronic issues and I had to go to dealer few times and drive a loaner for 3 weeks to get it fixed.  The transmission stops at Reverse mode and does not go all the way to the Parking mode easily after you park your car, A few times car moved back caused dangerous situations for me.It was a recall on it but they could not fix it.The mirrors has a larger blind-spot area compare to other cars.Sound system and Bluetooth stops working sometimes and I have to turn the engine on and off to makes it work again and dealer did not find any solution for it.There was about 10 recalls on this car since 2015 and I had to make appointments to drop it off at dealer to fix it.It is very inconvenient if you have a busy day schedule to commit yourself to amount of services that this car requires.The loaner from Maserati while your car is in the dealer for repair or service is from car rental  companies and it is not even a Luxury car usually.The appointments to fix this car was long and I had to drive my other car in between when there was a major problem with this car. For example the engine oil pressure light went on and the the dealer was booked for the next 2 weeks and I had to drive my other car meanwhile .Very disappointed with Maserati and I do not recommend this car.

maserati,ghibli,2014,jay, 12/11/2019,"looks great, sounds good but quality .....",1,"bought the SQ4 with 20k miles on it, loved it, took good care of it, did all the service. the car looks really nice and sounds great, decent amount of power actually pretty good in snow BUT I owned the car for about a year put on around 10k miles on it, didn't abuse it or redline it much, every month or two something breaks on the damn car, some things like A/C don't work due to a tiny leak, the build in sub for the sound system rattles like crazy, burns oil like crazy (dealer told me it was normal? yeah right), nav system freezes and glitches, some times the screen just won't turn on, steering wheel clicks when turning and the thing that made me get rid of the car was valve train issue, hear a metal on metal sound that match the rev, pulled the oil filter and saw shiny metals in oil, was told warranty was over 2 weeks before this and it would need a new engine at 30k miles. I love the car even with the small issues but new engine at 30k made me give up on the car.
"
maserati,ghibli,2014,pluther, 12/02/2013,Ghibli SQ4,4,"Purchased the Ghibli SQ4 after being a BMW 5 series driver for over a decade.
There are so many
BMW's on the road now that they are just not that unique anymore.
The Ghibli seemed like a very unique option and I am overall very pleased.
 I only have 500 miles on the car but it has been a lot of fun.
The Ghibli is not a luxury car...it's a true sports car that is built do drive.
It has a firm ride (which I love) and it's pretty noisy compared to BMW or Mercedes but that's what I wanted.
It's handling and exhaust are second to none in this class...really awesome.
The paddle shifters work terrific and shift instantly unlike many competitors.
The car design is beautiful!"
maserati,ghibli,2014,Olliesimone, 03/11/2017,Chryslerati.....no thanks,1,"German cars are in a different galaxy.  An m5 or S6 humiliates this car. Heck I have an x5 diesel that Drives waaay better than this. A supper laggy throttle, Parts from the Chrysler parts bin throughout the poorest stereo of any car I have ever been in this includes a rented Nissan Versa ( worst car ever built) etc etc.  I dumped this thing after 4000 miles. Chrysler running the show is a huge mistake for this iconic brand. Stay far away and until they make a sea change in the design and approach just stick with a German brand.

maserati,ghibli,2014,Tincho45, 07/20/2019,what did we expect?,4,"I bought a used Ghibli sq4 with 28k+. Apart from the Nav system and the sound, yes it lets you down for quality and ""luxury"". I have not had a problem with it. Yes it is pretty low, not suitable for cities roads with a great amount of pot holes, suspension travel is limited. The looks are great, the tan interior is wonderful. The power band in ""ICE"" mode  is not the greatest. Things start to change dramatically in manual or sport mode, the electric steering has a little ""hole"" in the middle of going left or right, but it gets stiffer in the sport mode, as expected. If you are looking for a confortable smooth ride, hardly no noise from the road, etc, then yes go for a mb or bmw with a higher ride Hight, bigger profile tires etc. I love it.... mop reported limp mode from transmission or any other problems that I could find after spending 1 hr inspecting it before purchase on a lift and then on a 10 minute dirve.

maserati,ghibli,2014,David, 02/16/2020,Italian Beauty,4,"Did a ton of research before purchasing used 2014 Ghibli with 70k miles.  So far car has been great and I'm not sure why there was so many negative reviews.  I like the fit and finish, car is solid but weighs ~5500 lbs.  Great exhaust sound and  a joy to take on long trips.  Only negatives - entertainment system lights are too bright at night and backup camera image is grainy.

maserati,ghibli,2014,unhappy, 07/28/2016,not a good car,3,"The worst when it comes to how low it is. It scrapes everything and then we are required to pay for the fixes.  It must be raised!  Car is shop constantly.  Not a safe car!

maserati,ghibli,2015,Jon Peterson, 09/15/2015,Ghibli/Ferrari!,5,"The car magazine guys are crazy . This is a great car. for the price of a 5 series or  boring E class you get an all wheel drive Ferrari powered car and you can pre-pay for all service costs for 4 years for less than $2000.00. People complain about Chrysler parts ... but they don't call these same parts Chrysler when the see them in a Mercedes! (most modern Chrysler stuff is from when Mercedes owned them) Certified deals are out there making it an even better choice (5 year 100,000 mile certified warranty). When in Manual setting it STAYS in gear . When in Sport the engine sound is as good as it gets. Drama + head turning + Ferrari ... this car has a soul... go drive one! Ferrari engine built on a Mercedes/Chrysler block .. Italian style ... American electronics that work .. German 8 speed manu/matic transmission... what is not to like?

maserati,ghibli,2015,Danny Forge, 03/06/2016,Maserati Ghibili S Q4; It's That Car You Will Love,5,"The new Maserati Ghibili S Q4 will have you taking rides that you normally would not take. It is Q4 quick, handling is fantastic and the interior is plain but elegant. Many will notice this is not the typical everyday Mercedes that are all too common. Many will notice this the Ghibili is packing some power simply at start-up. Many will also like to go for a ride. I really like the trunk space! The lines are unequivocally unmatched with a simply beautiful paint job that was meant to last. The wheels are sweet and the stagger is perfect. Now, for the just ok. The stereo needs aftermarket help and the gas mileage is not that great. Anyhow, go drive one and get to know it! The Maserati Ghibili and I think you will find that it really is a car that you will love.

I put in a 10"" JL sub and amp. Lots of cutting but came out fantastic.

UPDATE:  after owning this car for a couple years now I've put a set of Michelin 3+ and the ride even better than it was before !  I am very pleased with my purchase and happy I did not buy an Audi, Mercedes or BMW.

UPDATE:  The more I drive this car the more enjoyable it has become.  There is nothing new to report. I am pleased with my choice over the other noted above.

maserati,ghibli,2015,TBayFlorida, 05/22/2016,Extremely happy with our 2016 Gibli S,5,"While our GHIBLI S may be at the low end of available Maserati's, this vehicle is as much fun to drive as any vehicle we might have considered within our budget and by fun, I mean not only a sexy eye catching style inside and out, but a head turning beauty that wakes-up lookers with a sporty roar from those quad pipes which competing vehicles just can't match, all with a comfort that makes my wife and I smile ear to ear with every mile we drive.  In our younger years, we've had a brand new Corvette and some Mercedes too, including a 560 SL, all of which we have grown tired of over time.  We briefly considered a BMW, but it seems nearly every college kid has one now or at least a friend who does and quite frankly, there are so many BMW's on the road today, they  are even becoming boring to the eye.  So, this time, while we had our eye on the upcomming re-styled 2017 Porche Panamera, we just got tired of waiting and found ourselves attracted to the Maserati Gibli.  Not only did we save some cash, but we are convinced we made the right choice when chossing the GIBLI S instead of the Panamera.  We just took our first long distance road trip (about 2500 miles) and we probably received more compliments about our Maserati in a week, than in a lifetime of driving other vehicles, because it is simply the nicest vehicle we've ever had.  We love ours!!!
"
maserati,ghibli,2015,Paolo, 09/04/2015,Perfect balance between a smooth and sporty ride,5,"If your priority is a very smooth ride there might be other good choices, however, if you (like me...) actually also enjoy driving,  this is a GREAT choice.  I agree with some criticism about the interior, a few marginal features could have be done better, but overall I tested many other cars in this class and no one came close to offer the same emotions and pleasure.   

Update: after 36 months still very happy and deeply in love with this car !!  Best vehicle I ever (& proudly) owned.

maserati,ghibli,2015,Romolo Battisti, 09/21/2015,Stop vile excuses !,5,"Before I bought my 2015 S Q4 I was very concerned reading reviews with some level of criticisms for this car.  At the same time I was also very intrigued by other very positive reviews and comments. It looks like objectivity is not a parameter commonly used to review the Ghibli !   So.... I tested (test drive) against other upscale cars I was interested in and decide to buy the Ghibli based on my own taste and driving experience. As of today I am sooooo glad....    Yes, objectively, there are aspects that needs improvement (gear paddle, belt locking mechanism easier to reach, quality of audio system) but compared to the car style (class on its own), the performances and (sublime) handling these are just minor issues (or vile excuses for a few detractors).    I have only 1200 miles on the car and cannot completely  assess the reliability, but as far as brake,  handling and overall performance (these not subjective...)  I really cannot (logically) explain negative comments in those areas, go figure !
"
maserati,ghibli,2015,will, 04/25/2016,One of the best I have driven,4,"I really love the way this car drives. It is very comfortable.  I have the sport suspension and it really is about perfect. The engine is really spectacular.  I have read some reviews that mentioned that it did have to build boost,  I can sometimes feel the hesitation when starting from a stop.  It has incredible acceleration.  The exhaust sounds fantastic.  
My main complaint in this car is the stereo.  It just really does not sound that great.  The infotainment system works really well.  I have read where some critics have blasted using the same system from a Jeep Grand Cherokee,  but I think it is one of the best I have seen.  It is very easy to use.
My last complain is the parking sensors.  It would be nice to have a switch to toggle it on and off. 
The car really looks good and I get tons of compliments.  I also think the interior is very nice.  The seats look and feel great.  If it weren't for the stereo,  I would say it was the best car I have owned.

maserati,ghibli,2015,Michael Harper, 03/02/2016,The Maserati Ghibili Is That Car!,5,"I have owned a Mercedes for over 10 years, test driven few of the new models and spoken to the mechanics a the Mercedes dealer. Why? Because once you own a Mercedes it is very hard to change to a different sedan much like Corvette owners. After testing the Maserati Ghibili, inspecting as much as possible with an eye for detail and speaking to mechanics, I have a feeling that some of the reviews on this car are written by the competition. I do not know this for sure but I have to tell you I have decided to make the switch to the Maserati S Q4. Here are my reasons. The power is flat out amazing. The exterior and interior is very unique and absolutely stunning. The leather and comfort in the front two seats is fantastic. My kids are happy in the back seats. The gauges are very easy to read and the handling is better that most in its class however the ride is a bit stiffer vs many of the Mercedes models but not by much. The trunk has quite a bit more room that you would think. The stereo needs work but I will get that straightened out somehow. The gas mileage is not great but with gas prices so low, I am fine with that for now. I wish I could speak toward the reliability of the Q4 but I can not at this time. One of the main decisions that I considered was that every day while driving I see soooo many Mercedes-Benz vehicles on the road that they have become a bit boring to look at. Anyhow, good luck on whatever you decide :)

maserati,ghibli,2015,Richard DeLoskey, PhD,Very nice luxury sports sedan,5,"I have owned this car for about 6 months and have driven it just under 6,000 miles.    I have driven a Porsche Panamera for about 120 miles.   Both cars are excellent and a blast to drive.  The Maserati Ghibli is not quite as responsive as the Porsche Panamera, but it has a softer ride and nicer interior.   The navigation is the best I have ever used, very user friendly; you don't have to read the intruction to use, it is that intuitive!!!!!   I do not understand the complaints by reviewers about the shared Chrysler knobs and similar navigation system.  None of the other manufacturers (Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi, or Porsche) use significantly better knobs and most have less intuitive navigation systems that require one to at least read part of the instructions.  If your only compliant are the knobs and the easy-to-use navigation unit, then I would say, it is a great sports sedan.   I chose the Maserati Ghibli over the Porsche Panamera mainly because of the price for two very comparable cars;  these 2 luxury sports sedans stand out from the others in style and driving performance on windy roads.  Don't believe the reviews, drive it for yourself and experience the Ghibli or the Quatroporte.  If you like to drive spirited, then you will love the Maderati Ghibli, the Quatroporte Q4 and the Porsche Panamera 4/4S.  The others luxury sports sedans just aren't the same, even though they are nice, just not as exciting.

maserati,ghibli,2015,Coldasballs, 01/30/2019,Ghibli SQ4 - Not meant for the cold!,3,"Have had my 2015 for two months. Have really loved it until WI was hit with the coldest snap in decades. The car had sat all day while at work. The car sat in 0 degrees temp all day. Struggled to start after work but did and I warmed it until the temp gauge began registering. Drove cautiously about 1/4 mile to daycare to pick up my 3yr old. We pulled away and then the car started sputtering and white smoke began to pour out the exhaust as I tried to keep it running. THEN it went dead. Deadly temperatures and a small child aboard! I began to panic. Hazards on and cars lined up behind me, I tried starting it. It came to life but continued to sputter and smoke. I was able to get to a near by parking lot. There it sat to be towed. We got an uber to the dealership and got a loaner to get home safely. This wasn’t th first sign she doesn’t like extreme cold. Earlier in the week the power steering light had come on until it warmed up thoroughly and the radio had started working intermittently. It’s a fun car but not meant for the cold. I’m undecided if I’m going to throw in the towel on her.

maserati,ghibli,2015,Vito Fontanelli, 11/10/2018,The Thorobred of saloons with a Ferrari engine,5,"You can tell the quality, tradition, elegance and style the moment you step in. The sound of the revving engine is an Italian aria, the body design stands out in comparison to any saloon on the road today. When I visited the factory I was amazed, it was like a surgical theatre with the assembly line technicians in white gloves working in complete silence. The history going back over a hundred years shows in the classic badge representing the Neptune fork of a great statue in the center of Bologna (the three prongs for the three Maserati brothers),the oval analogue clock, 9 international race victories in the 1930’ 40’ and 50’ . This marque is all about class and refined technology without compromise.

maserati,ghibli,2015,Alberto Arias, 12/12/2018,Elegant Look & Excellent Performance,5,"When I traded my 2011 C63 AMG, I wasn't sure what I was getting into. but after driving this vehicle for the last 7k miles, I've noticed how pleasurable and enjoyable it is to drive. The car is fast and response almost instantaneously during acceleration. the braking system is also very quick to reduce and bring the speed down. the car feels strong and very quiet at the same time. the sound of the engine through the exhaust pipes is just music for the ears of any car enthusiast. The elegance of the vehicle is a neck breaker. Definitely an eye catchy. I was very skeptical when I purchased this vehicle, but I can say today that I have the pleasure to experience owning this masterpiece. Elegant and Performance are not enough to describe this car..... Simply, Perfect!

maserati,ghibli,2015,Rich A. , 08/11/2019,With all the bad. Still best car in it's class!,5,"I have owed the Ghibli for a few years now. White/Cuoio (brown), all add on's (97k msrp)
Pros:
Sound, comfort, exclusive, power, column paddle shifters, stance, curves, front facia, quad exhaust tips, visibility, info screen, and much more. 
Cons:
After warranty expires, part expensive, maintenance is about avg $1500 a year, insurance is a bit high compare to BMW and Benz, If not daily driver don't buy it!, battery drains if it sits. mpg pretty crappy about 17 avg. is very low, so you cant get in everywhere, be careful.

Summary: you pay about more on cost of ownership, but the feeling when you drive it, is the best. And everyone looking at it enjoys it (sometimes hates it) as much as you do.

maserati,ghibli,2015,Douglas W. Bush, 03/08/2020,Love it!,5,"I recently purchased a 2015 Ghibli S Q4, sapphire blue with Sabina interior and I absolutely love the interior, exterior, as well as all of the bells and whistles that this car has on it.  It drives amazingly well with traction and handling that makes the car comfortable for both city and highway.  I immediately had the windows tinted and the car ceramic coated to last for many years to come.  I also did my research and purchased a 5-year warranty should anything go wrong.  That’s how much I love and intend to keep this car.  The only drawback, and I still do not understand it, is just why the Maserati cars lose their value so quickly in spite of just how good they really are.  I highly recommend this car.

I highly recommend to test drive it.   Most dealer will give you great leasing options.     base model usually starts with $500/ month for 3 year lease.   I owned Audi A4 and A6 before,   this car is more beautiful, and fast!       Head turner as well.  Swooping Italian design, front grille with large Trident symbol gives it aggressive look.   If you want the high tech gadget car and comfortable seat for 5 with leg room, then its not for you.    This definitely is Italian sports car with 5 seats for $70k.!!!     Only negative is, auto insurance and maintenance fees are higher than other car in same price range.

a car like this repairs are the same as on Porsche or Mercedes. The feel of driving a car like this is well worth it.

maserati,ghibli,2017,Robert F, 10/28/2018,Avacar Italian Beauty,5,"I love this car, where I call it my Avacar (in reference of the movie Avatar), where this car is the expansion of the best of me in a vehicle.  I Love the overall handling, the sound of the engine (when in Sport), and the acceleration is awesome from 0-60, but also and especially 60-90 mph, even up steep grades.  The control systems are easy enough to figure out (the navigation kind of sucks), but everything else is high quality, simple to use and can be controlled either on the large screen or manually.  Also, the front seats are roomy where I am 6'-6"" tall, 300 pounds and I fit comfortably in this Italian Beauty; although the backseats are cramped, where I don't even try to fit in the back, but use the backseats for storing items.  The trunk is large and wide and the seats fold down when items are longer than 4 feet.  The exterior of the car and rims looks slick; we got the color in champagne and it looks both sporty and luxurious.
"
maserati,ghibli,2017,JBR, 12/09/2017,Worst seats in history,2,"The front seats are so painfully uncomfortable they could be used to coerce confessions. The upper part of the seats, behind the shoulders, is too narrow and sticks out way too far, so you can't really sit back into the seat without feeling like you have two fists in your shoulder blades. I can basically drive the car for five minutes without being in pain. And there's really no fix to this, especially because the corporate office is totally nonresponsive, and the dealer is just happy to have one less of these things to have to move.  I guess I should've leaned back more into the seat during the short test drive.  And that's just the front seat.  Back seat passengers have difficulty getting in and out, and then complain that the seats are too wedge-like, like their butt is being pinched together. Anyway, I've been trying to sell this car from the moment I leased it. I know I'll take a hit, but it's better than being in pain for the next three years (and maybe I'll just sue the company). Next time I'll just spend a little extra money and get a proper Mercedes or Jaguar or something like that.

I finally went for the Ghibli S Q4 MY2018 with all the most recent updates. I come from Porsche, BMW and Audi ownership experience. I can say that the Ghibli has been the best experience so far. The uniqueness, the style, the emotion and the driving pleasure is incomparable. The platform and the engineering has been improved over time and it is very solid and reliable as of right now. The interior has been improved since it was introduced. Same for the driving assistance features. Exterior style has been improved as well with some slight, but very effective, changes. The ride is refined and the pickup and progression is impressive. Acceleration is great, because we are talking about the V6 Twinturbo 424HP... I am not a fan of the base engine, it doesn't seems to be the right choise to keep with the prestige and performance heritage of Maserati. So the SQ4 is the only way to go for me. The car does receive a lot of attention and it differentiate from the mass and Germans.

The GPS is incredibly horrible. It is not touch screen and there are no street names listed other than the street you are travelling on. If you purchase Sirius radio, the real time traffic option will not work with this 2013 vehicle. 

The sound system is not loud enough when travelling with the top down. In terms of comfort, it is wonderful. The acceleration could be a lot better. This is a heavy vehicle. Very smooth ride. 

Engine sounds amazing and the vehicle definitely draws attention. The top takes a little long to retract compared to other convertibles."
maserati,granturismo-convertible,2013,Andrew Beyzman, 10/24/2015,STAY AWAY!! MAJOR RIP-OFF!!,2,"I leased my 2013 Maserati from Maserati of Manhattan.  Initially there was some issue getting the lease approved because the dealership didn't provide the proper paperwork.  More importantly, the battery on the car died 4 times in 2 years.  One was replaced a year ago and now the Maserati service is telling me it needs to be replaced again.  What's more, they're charging me $500, claiming that the warranty doesn't cover it because the mileage on the car is TOO LOW!!!!!! Also, about a year ago they had to replace tire that formed a ""bubble"" and returned the car to me with the tire inflated to twice the normal pressure!! I contacted the Long Island Maserati service and basically was told they they ""forgot"" to balance the tire pressure.  They haven't, however, forget to charge me in excess of $500!! I have already registered a complaint with Maserati Headquarters about 1 year ago.  I'm currently in process of consulting a lemon-law attorney to break the lease.  Add to that the disasterous GPS and screen control, a poorly-functioning iPod connector and rain wipers that had to be changed twice in less than 2 years, and you'll get the picture. 
  The biggest mistake I made was to swipe my beautiful Jag XKR that ran like a dream and didn't give me any troubles at all for this insanely overpriced, worst-serviced car.  Stay away!!

Not having owned an Italian car before, it took me a while to get used to some of the quirky design features. Sometimes you wonder what were those Italian designers thinking. Like for example: there are no controls for the phone or the stereo on the steering wheel. Want to answer or hang up the call on your phone? Need to do it on the screen. Want to change radio stations or the volume on your audio? Need to go to the screen. Can get distracting while driving. Outward visibility is kind of restricted also. And, fuel economy sucks. But, there are so many high marks: comfortable seats in front and back, great riding and steering, good cargo space, gorgeous looks inside and out, and of course that sexy growl of the engine. All in all, I am extremely pleased with my Levante. I had a Range Rover Sport before, and I really liked my Range Rover, but I prefer the Levante now.

maserati,levante,2017,Sue from Atlanta, 11/04/2017,LIKE A FINE ITALIAN LEATHER PURSE ON WHEELS...,5,"trading in a Porsche Cayenne this was a surprise gift from the husband. I have been wanting a Maserati for years since he purchased his first Ferrari....I was jealous!! I met him at the dealer to pick up his car that was being serviced when I saw the Lavente on the showroom floor. A 2018 that had just come in it was stunning. Dark blue in color with the most beautiful dark gray/dark tan leather interior it reminded me of a beautiful leather purse....Hey I'm a women what else would I think of. It had beautiful dark gray wheels that complimented the dark blue of the exterior. The dealer let me drive as many cars as I wanted (4 in all) before I decided on the one that first caught my eye. The smaller horsepower of the two models I felt it was fast enough for me to drive around town. The ""sport"" feature kicks it up a notch giving it that fabulous Ferrari exhaust sound. My husband was sold the minute he heard two things. It has a Ferrari engine and is chain driven. I fell for the gorgeous interior and loved the fact that the car raises and lowers a whole 9"" for ease of getting in and out. Not only am I a women but I'm old! And one last really fabulous feature this car has...if another car is passing you in your blind spot a light along with a ""ding""l goes off on the side mirrors of the car alerting you someone is there. A safety feature every car should come with. Go drive one and you will be sold!
UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER......
The car is still fabulous.....not one complaint or issue with it in the past year. I love that in a year I have only seen one other on my side of Atlanta. My old Porsche Cayenne was a dime a dozen. The gas mileage has leveled off at about 14-16 mpg. I rarely drive it on the highway this is mostly local driving. Every feature works just fine. The sound of the engine sold me then and I still love starting it up. It sounds just like my husbands Ferrari. I highly recommend this SUV.....one more thing I love the feature how the car raises and lowers by a full 9"" so it's very easy to get in and out of....especially at my age....it keeps me young!

maserati,levante,2017,Al, 12/01/2017,Service is HORRIBLE--Nasty people. Stay Away!!!!,1,"Dealer, Maserati of Bergen County, Rt 17, Upper Saddle River, NJ  is obnxious---service is horrible, never have loaners available, do not fix problems ( service guys will argue with you and say there is  nothing wrong). My battery is replaced almost every time I bring it in for service. Battery replacement is  their fix for everything,----only thing is the problems never get fixed.I had to start a lawsuit to try  to get anything done. They can't survive much longer. NYC dealership already went under. I will trade in my Levante ---- probably for a Porsche---now , before Maserati is out of business and their vehicles are worthless------just like a Saturn. 

I have brought it in for repairs (which have still not been  performed) about 25 times. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND ATTITUDE.  There is no one in service dept at Maserati of Bergen County until 10:00 AM, although they CLAIM to be open at 8:00 AM-----NO WAY!!!
When they finally arrive for the day, or part of the day anyway, they immediately moan and groan when you tell them whats still wrong with the vehicle----then the aggravation begins---and its endless!!!


WHAT A JOKE!!!!!

When I bought it, it would appear that absolutely no ""dealer prep"" was performed on my Levante (except for a car wash). When it was turned over to me it had a series of problems:
-each tire was inflated with a different air pressure ranging from 51 psi to 34 psi.Fortunatelythe sales person realized it and  had it corrected while I waited for my new Levante.
-steering column had a terrible vibration in it that I realized on my drive home
-interior lighting would not shut off when I got to my driveway
I called the dealership and literally had to ""beg"" the service department manager  to get the steering and lighting corrected and was told by him:
     -No loaners are available
     -I would have to ""wait "" for the car to be serviced. He did no know long it would take to make the repairs.
     -I suggested instead that someone pick up the car at my home and bring it to the dealership. He felt that was a really good idea!
     -A t first I was told the tires had to be rebalanced  
     -I was then informed that  the balance machine showed that the tires could not be brought in to proper balance and 4 new tires were requested from maserati but i would have to wait for their response. 
     -A few days later I was told that  it didn't need new tires and the existing tires were able to be rebalanced and the car would be ready that day. That didn't happen.
                        -no one called me for 2 more days 
    -Afer my Levante spent five (5) days in the ""shop"" I picked it up.   The service manager told me that since the vehicle sat at the ""shipping port"" for a while when it entered the USA, the tires became uneven. A simple rebalancing was now performed...the problem was fixed  and I was good to go. 
 (Not quite)
    - The problem still existed exactly as before and I had to get it over to your service people for the 4th time for the same problem.
Finally after 4 trys I was told that it needed new tires (around and around we go), BUT , Maserati had to approve it .........and lo and behold they finally did. My brand new Levante spent 15 days in the shop, seemingly spun around on a merry go round and after 4 trys  the steering column and lighting finally were repaired.

maserati,levante,2017,David Handler, 01/07/2018,sold after 5 months,2,"My wife drove a BMW X5 for 6 years, and this last August we traded it in to lease a Maserati Levante.  Last week, we took at $20,000 loss (got $13,000 for the trade in and had to pay more than $7000 to get out of the lease) to get out of the lease, and bought a new BMW X5.  So many problems with the Levante.  Most of all, the controls are terrible.  You can't see/read the stick behind the steering wheel that controls the wipers without leaning over the steering wheel.  The button on the steering wheel doesn't switch between your preset radio stations, but only scans all stations!  To go to your presets, you have to use the touch screen:  hit radio, and then reach out to touch the station (or use the wheel between the front seats).  Either way, you have to take your hands off the steering wheel.  The engine turns off when you stop at a light, but the dealership told us we can turn off that function.  True, but every time you start the car you need to click through 4 menus on the dash to get to the spot to turn it off, and then click back to display the speed digitally!  Huge nuisance.  I am 5'9"" and drove with the drivers' seat as far back as it can go.  What would someone do who is 6' or taller??  We found the seats to be relatively narrow and tight, and my wife is only 5' and 105 lbs, while I'm 5'9"" and 170 lbs (i.e., we aren't big people).  We got leather seats, but if you reach between the console and seats (e.g., when you drop your phone in between), you feel/see that they put cotton in that area rather than finishing off the seats with leather.  There are heated seats but no hard button to turn them on and off-- again, back to the touch screen (go to main menu, hit ""controls"" and then hit the seat heater buttons).  The seat heaters turn off after 5 or 10 minutes, so you need to repeat those steps to turn them back on (assuming you put your screen back to radio, Apple Play or navigation in the meantime).  Turning radius is not good-- we had a hard time turning into parking spaces without backing up.  This became even more apparent when we got the new X5 this week-- we really see the difference in the steering between the X5 and Levante.  Also since our first snows here in Chicago in December, the X5 handles far better than the Levante, which we always felt sliding.  We spent around $80k on the Levante and hated it so much that we took a $20k hit to get out of our lease and avoid driving this car for 3 more years (took a 39 mo lease).  The X5 has none of the deficiencies mentioned above.  Everyone thought the Levante was cool, and valets always parked it in front of the restaurant, but it was a terrible experience for us.  I was considering a Maserati Gran Turismo to replace my BMW 650ix convertible next year, but not after this experience.

Few issues: the ac system stinks, as it is too hot when should be cold etc. The parking system with video cameras in front turns itself off when one gets really close (!) so one has to go back and manually reactivate--annoying. So small problems I hope they will sort out in the subsequent model years. Highly recommended.

maserati,levante,2017,QC, 12/14/2016,The Maserati Lavente Is As Beautiful As The Ghibli,5,"I believe this Lavente  May take away sales from the Ghibli but not many.  If you compare both vehicles side-by-side there a different experience altogether.  Certainly, you cannot go wrong with the Gibli as it continues to be a stunning, luxurious and comfortable ride. The Lavente has most of the amazing featurs and appearance as the Ghibli and also has more room inside. Personally, I think it's a tossup! Both are amazing and much better than many of the other cars in their  respective theaters. If you are considering the Ghibli luxury sports car,  I would suggest you take a hard look at the SQ4.

maserati,levante,2017,Arman M., 06/25/2017,Pure Luxury,5,"I have a Ghibli and Levante they both are amazing cars. Levante is the best SUV I ever had. Love the sport future when you go fast on the road is lowers the car suspension and make you feel like you are driving a sport car rather SUV. At some corners Levante takes a better turns than my Ghibli. It is much better car than any other luxury SUV's. The technology is unthinkable. There are so many little details that I learn something new on daily basis and get amazed how they thought of every little detail. Words can not describe, it's better to drive once then hear me talk about it.

maserati,levante,2017,Ivan Miller, 01/14/2018,Great SUV,5,"My wife traded in a Porsche Macan S for a base Levante with full leather. The seats are most comfortable we ever sat in. She had BMW X-3 with M-Sport PKG and that seats were very narrow...yes the inside side of front seats have fabric, so did Porsche. The Sport feature is awesome. I have a Dodge Charger and noticed the steering and NAV are from same supplier....people who complained no steering wheel controls, read your manual lol...like my Charger...radio controls are also on the back of the steering wheel...volume, mute, change stations...plus voice activation lets you control phone, radio and climate control. Of course, this is limited production car, so dont expect 25 loaners waiting for you. But also, you can pull into a lot with 25 BMWs and your the only Maserati...  :-P

The stereo sucks, the front tires rub the inside of the front end when I go in reverse and a really nice rattle at 20 miles an hour lets all know I am coming home! Hit the gas and go.... yes except for the delay before it decides to go! At 70 I can feel the road in the steering wheel and the gas pedal... don't worry the squeaking breaks do stop on a dime!  The best part is I am the ""only person in the world to have these issues"" I have been told. They gave me a temp Levante that was new and had to get jumped 3 time in a 24 hour period before they took it away.  So don't worry go buy one because I am the only one who has any issues at all....  My answer to the problem was presented to me... trade it in and buy a better Maserati!!! Sure I guess the $20,000 I will lose in the trade is just the cost for thinking I was getting a badass Maserati!

maserati,levante,2017,Winston, 08/03/2019,Rides like a sedan,5,"After test driving a Range Rover Sport and Levante on the same day, my wife and I both liked the Levante significantly better.  I particularly like the rear seat legroom, much better than other SUVs in its class; it's a great car to go out to dinner with another couple or your teenage kids.  My wife never enjoys driving my Cayenne Turbo, but feels much more comfortable in the Levante.  We've had our Levante S for almost 2 years with no issues.  I was a bit worried about owning a Maserati, so I bought an extended warranty, but in hindsight, this car is very well built, engineered, reliable, and the interior finishes are awesome, so probably didn't need the extra warranty.  In contrast,after numerous trips to the service department, totaling over 60 days last year, our friends just gave their leased 2017 Supercharged Range Rover Sport back to the dealer under the Lemon Law, and that $120K car will be taken to the junkyard and crushed.

This is my 2nd Maserati and likely the last.  Although I had no issues with the first one (Granturismo), I only owned it for less than a year.  For a 6 figure car, this is just unacceptable - Maserati service refuses to do anything about the squeaky brakes, and I can’t get my sales rep to return my call.

THE BAD: Can’t permanently shut off 'start and stop' feature. No seat cooling. Need to press accept on the screen every time you start the car, even Lexus corrected that. For calls, need to press the button to talk on cell every time entering the car, it should let you automatically, so annoying! Start button is on the left side, most people are right handed.

After test driving several sporty suv’s, we chose the Levante. The interior is gorgeous. The Levante has the speed, the looks, the vroom-vroom that makes it feel like a sports car but is way more comfortable. Much more so than the Porsche SUV. We always took our Tesla or my husbands Chevy Silverado  (never the 911) for road trips, but now the Maserati is our favorite. It’s so easy to pack the back with luggage and go! It’s Our favorite! Even our two dogs like it.

maserati,levante,2017,Matt C, 10/26/2020,"Ultra-Luxury Driving Experience, Exceptional Deal",5,"The depreciation is fierce on Maserati's but the driving experience is exceptional. 

I made it a goal to buy a Luxury car - a step above BMW/Mercedes/Lexus - something I could feel proud of driving around in. My choice was between a 2017 Porsche Macan S and 2017 Maserati Levante. I went with the Levante for a number of reasons and have enjoyed every minute owning the ride.

LOVE:
*Interior space, comfortable seating - Passengers love riding in this car, it's spacious with cooling/heating seats.
*Ferrari-built Turbo V6 Engine - Acceleration is satisfying, the Italian sports car / Ferrari engine noise when your accelerating.
*Dynamic suspension - A unique feeling to feel your car move up-and-down for an optimal driving experience.
*Cooling seats is a neat feature.
*Front of the car is honestly sexy af. I love the look of the grill vs a Range Rover or Porsche Macan/Cayenne. Back is mediocre - I'd prefer at Range Rover in styling if you're looking at the back or side of the car. Side of the car with the signature ""Maserati vents"" are nice.
*Driver's experience - Truly feels like driving a sports car but it's an SUV.

CONS:
*Infotainment is a little bare, ApplePlay makes a big difference. 
*Maintenance is expensive, especially if you go to a dealership. Need to buy mostly OEM parts if you want to fix anything as 3rd-party parts don't really exist.
*Trunk isn't huge but it's serviceable if you need to carry around large items.
*Not worth the original $75-$100k+ price tag. Value depreciates around 50% by year 3 or 4 of the car, I purchased at nearly 50% value at 3 years and 45k miles - very satisfied with my deal.

If you're shopping for ultra-luxury car brands - Porsche, Ferrari, Maserati, Range Rover, etc -- look at something 2-3 years old with low mileage. The depreciation has leveled off and that's when you can find some real diamonds. 

Purchased my Levante during the 2020 COVID-era, deals were abundant and I felt like I found the best deal on the planet buying this car. Listed for around $38k on Edmunds via an online-only dealership called Shift.com, the Levante came with 45k miles / no accidents / Base model.

maserati,levante,2017,Mike, 07/07/2018,Does anyone else have poor paint quality?,4,"I have a new 2017 Levante that has spots under the clear coat on the paint.  Some of the clear coat is pealing but the other spots appear to be primer contamination.  A high end paint shop says the entire car needs to be stripped and repainted.  I am taking it to Walnut Creek Maserati next week and will see what they say.  Only 4,000 miles on it, I like the way it handles and drives.  Nice fast car, 14 MPG.
"
maserati,levante,2017,CAM, 08/24/2018,Disappointed,4,"Overall the car is nice. The performance is good, although it feels like the turbo lags when starting to accelerate. The engine is always wanting to be pushed. Sport mode is fun. The exhaust noise and climate control(fans) make the noise level a bit unpleasant. I was sold on the exterior styling and a short test drive. Also liked the idea there are not many of them on the street. Had I had more time to test drive the car, I would not have leased it. There are many good options at this price level. Now I am upside down on a lease and will be regretting my decision for the next three years.

maserati,levante,2018,Danno1, 02/17/2018,Exotic SUV?,4,"I have had my Levante for one month. My last car (Jaguar XFR) is a great comparison for someone who needs an SUV but wants the performance of a sports car. The answer is yes and no. It's not a sports car, BUT, you get the thrill of one. Firstly, the reviews you read are usually about the base Levante. Which is crap. The S is a real Maserati though.You shouldn't buy this car if all you care about is cargo space, tech, finish etc...etc... You only buy this SUV if you want a thrilling ride because you care about the engine. I've never owned a maserati before, but I can tell you the following: This car is more thrilling than a 510hp Jag. It's all in the exhaust and Ferrari engine combination. Somehow it works better than the Ghibli and the Quattroporte (I test drove both) because it's an SUV. So.... Positives... after about three hours you learn how the car performs, and using the best in class (by far) paddles, and/or the sports mode, you learn that this car is a real Massa, and a cousin of Ferrari. This is where this car begins and ends. I test drove the Macan GTS (amazing) and the Cayenne S (fine) and they were both great, with better finish to interior* and tighter handling, and at around the same price. But here's the thing, neither had any personality whatsoever compared to the Levante S. The handling was tight and controlled but boring. I'm no race driver, but I understand my cars, and the Levante S is an exotic amongst SUVs because of the engine, handling and exhuast note. You'll need to pay a LOT more on insurance for a Levante because it really is an exotic. The negatives on this car are that every reviewer has mentioned that it shares buttons with jeep etc. but I've never known anyone who shops for this car who's even sat in a Jeep. Anyway I can tell you that the tech. is fine (compared to a 2016 mercedes e400 cabrio that my wife drives) and the interior looks more luxurious than any porsche, but to touch, porsche wins. Here's the thing, if you want a luxury suv but don't care about performance, than forget this car. If you want performance AND luxury, the only cars better than this are the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and/or maybe cayenne GTS. The thing is, they just don't have the exotic feel of this car. This is a drivers car, not a driver's, partner's car. 3000 revs and the exhaust expoldes like a Ferarri engine should, and it will blow you away. Now another downside. Maserati after sales are [non-permissible content removed]. Another one, it's insurance group is the same as Ferrari, Lambo, Aston etc. even for a V6 production SUV so be warned. It's worth it, but be warned, you're not buying a Lexus. Oh and it drinks gas like CRAZY.

maserati,levante,2018,Paul, 03/21/2019,Buyers be ware 2018 Maserati Levante,2,"Buyers be ware 2018 Maserati Levante
If you are thinking of buying or leasing a Maserati read this first
This is a 4 month review, I wanted to drive the car for a while before giving my opinion of the car and of my experiences to fellow car enthusiast who might be in the market for a sports SUV.  
The buying experience was as good and easy as expected from a dealership of this caliper. Helpful sales staff, water espresso, the works.
The Levante: The car started falling apart the first week of ownership. Plastic windshield molding literally came out and started flapping about the first time I got on a freeway.  On top of that the USB port didn’t work at all. Being disappointed I took the car back to the dealership and the sales person drove with me to service and told me that all will be taken care of. The service dept. gave me a loaner and I didn’t hear from them for 4 days. Finally I called. They told me they were waiting for parts for the stereo system. It had to be completely replaced because of a short in the USB port. When I picked up the car one of my rims and tire was damaged. It had a 3 inch gash. Of course service manager said that it wasn’t them, but agreed to fix the rim only not willing to change a brand new but damaged tire. 3 days later molding popped out again and I was right back again.
I have since made 6 more trips to service department for various noise/parts reasons. Service manager refuses to fix factory defective brakes. Brakes make a lot of grinding/squealing noise when braking. Service department is not what you would expect at a Ferrari. Its 10x10 ft room with a kitchen, sofa, tv and a coffee machine and it doubles for employee break room. Also Ferrari service doesn’t have any loaners. One of the times I was there I had to rent from Enterprise and now they broke it off with rental companies and it has became impossible to get a loaner. Service manager tells you to expect a call when loaner will become available and weeks go by without a phone call.  Ferrari service center in long island gets 1 star at best.
Cons:
1. Noisy/squeaky brakes (factory defect)
2. 1 second delayed acceleration (better in sport mode)
3. Transmission gear shifter constantly gets stock and is very hard to get into the right driving mode. Pops into Reverse instead of Park or N instead of drive. 
4. Infotainment screen auto dimming and brightness adjustment for day/night doesn’t work
5. Standard speakers produce very plain and empty sound especially at low-mid volume, not very loud at full volume.
6. For the exterior size of the car the interior accommodations are very tight and trunk is smaller than most sedans.
7. Very poor communication and customer service Long island Ferrari/ Maserati Service center
8. Eats a lot of gas, even in eco-mode (ICE MODE) 350 miles per 20 gallon tank
Pros:
1. Air suspension provides a better ride quality on New York roads.
2. Infotainment system is lag free well thought out. Easy to use while driving.
My advice is stay away from Maserati cars and especially from NY Long island branch.

maserati,levante,2018,Milco, 06/06/2019,Best car I have purchased so far,5,"The quality of the interiors is outstanding. The car came equipped with all the Adas (Autonomous driving Level 2). Concerning the road holding, equipped with 4 Pirelli Sottozero, she has been lake effect proof (I live in West Michigan). Honestly on dry I cannot even get close to the limit without risking to get my license burned. Concerning the engine, well it is a Ferrari engine, anyway my Levante towed my race car several times even down to Georgia, I have experienced plenty of torque and towing at 70mph (this is the max speed I can publicly declare isn't it?) the transmission temperature always remained in the normal range, even in summer. I never did any serious off road, but driving in some muddy road, so I cannot express any reliable judgement, even if the pneumatic suspension allow to adjust the height from the ground allowing pretty deep fords. The downside of buying this car is the fuel economy, she does everything (even racing in a track) but you just need to feed her. An other characteristic which should be improved is the storage volume which is slightly bigger than my previous Lexus RX350.
Unfortunately we have been hit by a violent storm, so I could test the off road quality of the Levante using the vehicle to clean my propriety: I could tow a cart full of wood uphill of a wet and steep trailer without any issue

maserati,levante,2018,Rob, 11/19/2018,Sport and luxury under one roof,4,"After owning BMW X5’s, Porsche Cayenne S and Macan Turbo, the Levante is more luxurious but drives much heavier and feels like a bigger SUV.  These other cars were better driving cars. Engine sound is great but sounds better than it performs, although it performs very well. Priced too high vs competition and resale value and gas mileage are poor.  Dealers offering huge discounts which tells you something. Having said that, it is a great combination of sportiness and luxury and it’s styling stands out. No service required over the first 4 months.
"
maserati,levante,2018,TJ, 03/18/2019,Nice Vehicle But There Are Better Choices,4,"As previous reviewers have posted, this is a nice vehicle but there is nothing that is truly outstanding. First, it looks and feels great upon entry. This vehicle  exudes a very simple refined elegance. Driving in sport mode is a must. The ride quality is nice but not overtly intrusive. The technology is fine but is a bit dated as there is no TFT screen nor heads up display which is disappointing. The breaking and the suspension are extremely capable. The exhaust note is quite nice and in sport mode the baffles open up when idling but upon acceleration, they close a bit so you get a great but not overwhelming exhaust note.  Also the seats although nice are not as functional as other in this class as there are no thigh / side / shoulder bolsters. The rear space is also capable and provide more than enough room for a long weekender or the empty nesters. Quite honestly, this vehicle feels more like a super refined QX70 which I really enjoyed but per the competition, the BMW X6 50i, Audi Q8, and Cayenne S will offer more / better technology, much better seating and a sportier ride.  This being stated, this vehicle has it own niche environment and there are some great deals as sales are very sluggish.  Also note any vehicle in this class will take a major hit on depreciation and will prove in the end to be a gas / maintenance hog. Hope this helps!

However, the transmission is clunky, brake pads and rotors need to be replaced every 10,000 miles. I’ve had a problem with the plastic trim pieces (and fake chrome) falling off while driving and going through the car wash. Overall I think there are better choices for a performance SUV.

maserati,levante,2019,Greg, 09/08/2020,Blown Away,5,"I went from a 2014 MB CLS 63amg and didn't think I could find an SUV that would make me this happy. The CLS was/is a great car; comfortable, fast, fun to drive etc. but with the miles hitting 100k it was time to swap.. Needing a bit more space, I was looking at the SUV's in this space; Cayenne, G63, Rover Sport SVR were the ones I was leaning toward and then at the last minute I drove this one and it was all over.

The V8 in this car not only sounds great but it such an incredible flexible and overall pleasing motor that I just can't drive it enough. On top of that, the ride is so smooth and so tight I don't even remember my CLS.

Quality so far has been great, no issues (new car) but fit and finish are excellent... Yes, it doesn't have the mega-computer sized dashboard of the Audi/MB/BMW/LR etc. but what you get is a very good intuitive technology with a motor that blows the others away. Smokes them, period.

So many people say bad things about this car and they may very well be true. However, buy a low mileage older car where the kinks are already worked out and you get a Ferrari for the price of a Ford. Will it cost more to maintain? Sure. But the driving experience is worth every penny! Mine has 38K miles and there are a few idiosyncrasies but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

Apparently the notion of competitive benchmarking isn't known in this company; it lacks some features that have been standard in other luxury cars for a decade. I'm praying that the problems will cease because, when I've been able to drive it, it's a really fun car to drive--and I don't mind the head-turning effects, either!  (I'm old enough to know it's the car, not me, causing the head- turning.)"
maserati,quattroporte,2005,murrayr1, 07/28/2005,A Not Ready for Prime Time Player,3,"I have had two, count them two Quattroportes. My first was a disaster. Computer, sensor and transmission failures.  The bright shining star has been the dealership and support. They have ALL been wonderful and tried very hard to make things right.  BUT, my second Q is currently having the transmission re-built. This car is a beauty and fun to drive. It cannot, however be what Maserati would like it to be, an entry level exotic.  I don't know what they are smoking on the other side but someone needs to do some serious re-thinking about quality control in a 100k car.  What I will do? Ball is in Maserati's court to make me real happy.  For now, this is not a prime time player."
maserati,quattroporte,2005,Pennston, 08/11/2005,Class with Flash,4,"This car gives you the feel of the powerful muscle car going thru the gears, but has the luxury features never imagined available with this type automobile. I have yet to take the car out and not get a double take or the typical shout ""What kind of car is that""  The performance and features of the car live up to the impact of the look.  "
maserati,quattroporte,2005,Sobrrr, 05/14/2005,Wow!,5,"I purchased my ""Limited Edition Neiman Marcus Quattroporte"" from the newly opened Penski Wynn dealership in the new 2.7 billion dollar Wynn Hotel Casino and no less than 500 of the people in the crowd to see the new hotel left the crowd they had been waiting in for hours to come over and check out this fine car. One gentleman had his wife take his picture next to it instead of the hotel! This car is a masterpiece of craftmanship. The interior is laid out very well, the leather is incredible, the guages set up in the right places and easy to read. The available features make for a very luxurious car.  The handling is of course superb! "
maserati,quattroporte,2005,LAFORZAGOP, 10/31/2005,The car for real enthusiasts,4,"This car is sick.  My dad bought his this July after driving the likes of the Mercedes-Benz S500, S55 AMG, BMW 745Li, and Jaguar XJR.  Of these cars the Maserati is definately the most special.  It looks like nothing on the road and people will constantly stare and give appeasing gestures.  It drives like a dream.  It corners absolutely ridiculouslt for a 5,000 lb. + four door sedan.  In fact I think it handles better than my Dad's heavily modded Porsche C4.  After driving this car I just don't think its possible to go back to the mass produced German and British cars.  It makes you feel special and you will find yourself just going outside just to look at it.  This is by far the best designed sedan on market today.  "

maserati,quattroporte,2006,massimovolo, 12/24/2011,poorly manufactured,2,"i bought this car in 2010 it was used. 
Im more disappointed in the quality of the equipment. in the same year i was driving from VA to NJ my car broke down halfway there- air condition pump went bad with only 17,000 miles on it. Also I felt a hesitation in cruise control when i was going downhill so I took it to the dealership. They said I had a bad clutch at 17,000 miles also. I am 100% Italian, born in Italy, I am ashamed to say this is an Italian made car. Its already cost me 3,900 for the compressor for the air condition and it's going to cost me another $5900 to replace the clutch. I can't believe that 140,000 car has this kind of equipment in it. "
maserati,quattroporte,2006,demon5332, 06/09/2015,Horrible quality,2,"I bought car with 38k miles and now have 45k miles. Car history looked like it had regular service as late as 36k miles at a Ferrari dealer. Since purchasing it I have replaced a shift actuator (10k part) an f1 pump, driver side door handle. The window wash sprayers do not work so some switch inside steering wheel broken. Massage seat on driver has not worked since purchase. Just started hearing air in back window and it wouldn't roll up so back window I've never used probably now needs a new window regulator. And clutch needs replacement. Off a stop the car has horrible at best acceleration and lurches even when using the manual and sport mode properly. Also interior in rear falling apart."
maserati,quattroporte,2006,Jay Huffaker, 06/18/2006,My second Q-porte as a daily driver,4,"This Italian creation is all that style means to the Italians.  The car draws admiration from all ages and economic strata.  This is my second Quattroporte, the first ('84) I drove daily for 8 years.  The build quality has improved beyond belief.  I drive this car hard and enjoy it the way I imagine it was intended.  So far there have been zero problems.   The performance is amazing.  Once you get a sense of where the limits are you can really have a sports car experience in the morning and enjoy the luxury as you and friends arrive at your favorite 5 star restaurant. that evening.  The controls are easy to use and well positioned.  But, remember the trany is a standard when on hills."
maserati,quattroporte,2006,Dominic, 09/21/2016,Drive it right and it will treat you well,4,"I purchased my QP used with 7k miles - the warning was clear about replacing the clutch at 30k or less. I drive a lot and have always used the manual/ sport mode. My first clutch lasted to 96k miles and then at 150k I replaced the clutch again. I am at 170k and going strong. I have had to replace the A/C compressor twice and the A/C actuators. I love the car but even just regular maintenance is costly.

maserati,quattroporte,2006,Briik, 03/05/2009,The Perfect Italian Saloon,4,"Title says it all.  This car makes me feel like the Godfather every time I drive it.  The styling, inside and out, is a perfect creation by the masters at Pininfarina.  The seats alone are like $10k Italian furniture pieces!  The engine is wonderfully powerful, with a huge torque curve maxing-out at over 7000RPM.  The SOUND from this car is totally out of this world and isn't comparable to the noise of any other 4-door on the planet.  All of the seats are adjustable with massive leg and head room (I'm 6'5"" tall and 250lbs and I fit perfectly).  Only complaint is that the head-rests on the seats don't raise up high enough for me.  Service is great in general, price for the work is exotic tho."
maserati,quattroporte,2006,bruce bordelon, 03/31/2006,Fun and Fast,4,This car is very interesting to drive. The suspension and handling feel like you are on rails and the car is drop dead gorgeous.

This is a rare and beautiful bird that you will find expensive to fix, but they don't break often..mine has had all the recalls done, and I found the clutch wear has been very acceptable....and clutches will be your most regular, costly expense ($5000 or so) very 30000 miles if you drive it smart, and in manual-sport..which listen that was this was designed to be driven in..if you need to used the AUTO button, get a 2007 or later with a true auto tranny.

DI've driven everything from the new Bentley Continental GT, Porsche 911 4S, Mercedes S550, BMW M6, etc...  Nothing compared to the styling, performance and price of the QP Sport GT.  It's the hottest car on the road and turns everyone's head, including my friends with Lambo's and 430s..."

It is better, much better than our Mercedes S class. It's more like an SL in a more comfortable CLS body. I'm now an ex-Mercedes-Benz customer (except for my SL)."
maserati,quattroporte,2006,jhuffdoc, 03/18/2012,Love my Mazzio,4," This is a manual transmission car which was not available in the list.
All 2006 QP's were.
I bought this with 1200 miles and have driven it daily.
I still love to look at it and drive it!

I was surprized at my first clutch and rear brakes having lasted only 12,000 miles, but chalk that up to showing friends the new car performance, it's been much better since.
It's rear brake biased and
those brakes and tires wear twice as fast as fronts, which was not expected.

There have been some irritations such as window regulators going out, a short in the wiring to the trunk lid, and valets breaking the reverse switch.

Regular maintenance is important and pays off in the long run."

maserati,quattroporte,2006,cucuza, 01/28/2007,Needs Design Help,2,"The car is beautiful...probably the most beautiful sedan out there. However, the dealership we use is awful.  They have no mechanics for the car.  Once I had an appointment and they told me that their mechanics were at the races and could not take care of my car.  It was the November 2006 at Homestead Speedway.  All American cars...go figure.  The mechanics were more important than someone who paid $130,000 for her car.  The car has a tire error.  If you u-turn tightly, the tire gets slashed by the body.  The 2005 transmission take time to pickup.  Hopefully they perfected it.  The 6-CD changer rattles like crazy. The car is meant to be driven on long trips/highway, not the city. It is a gorgeous car though."
maserati,quattroporte,2006,RAF, 03/14/2006,Wow!,4,"Unquestionably this is a car that makes driving more fun than I imagined it could be.  It requires more involvement than most and rewards accordingly.  Thus far, its reliability has been decidedly un-Italian, but everything else is decidedly so."
maserati,quattroporte,2007,Charlie Hawkins, 03/25/2016,I love this car!! It just draws you in...,5,"OK, I'm going to try to do this quick. If you are considering one of these cars, You wont be disappointed. I sold my 2002 911 cab and my 2004 BMW 7 Series and moved to this 2007 QP Exec GT and 07 Escalade. This Maserati is so cool. The engine with 400 hp and lots of torque, the sound of the exhaust (it gets louder on Sport Mode) the handling, interesting interior and the exterior styling are like no other in its class. The engine block in these cars was shared with the Ferrari F360 and F430 however the tuning and resulting HP output is higher in the final Ferrari versions. These QP's  are not mechanical nightmares at all. I have had nime for 4 years (from 2011 through present/2016) and have had no problems. Maintenance prices at the Ferrari/Maserati dealer are more than at Cadillac dealer but that is one of the trade off for driving a hand built Italian semi-exotic. The way this car drives above 50 MPH is hard to describe, All I can say is that it feels better than my modern day 911 did at speeds over 80, it seems to beg you to give it more gas. I know this really sounds weird, I find myself taking care of this car likes a living pet or something, I like it that much. If you are ""car"" person, these 2005 - 2008 pre-face lift (minor changes to bumpers and lights) are a steel right now! The list price on mine was $128,000. You can find good, reliable versions these cars now for between $30k and $45k. The ""duo-select"" same tranny as the Ferrari 360 paddle shift with clutch, but has an automatic mode is less sought after and expect to replace the clutch for about $4k every 35,000 miles. Conversely, the fully automatic transmission was released in 2007 models and it is flawless.  It is made in Germany by the same supplier that makes the Mercedes and BMW transmissions. Its one of the smartest  things Maserati ever did. These cars will sell for more and hold there value better than a duo select. 
If you aren't limited in your budget, then also consider Quottroporte 4.7 Liter ""S"" model. That engine is very powerful and am told it makes the driving experience even that much better. I believe the ""S"" engine option was available starting in 2011 I hope this information has helped any of you that are considering buying a used Quottroporte.
"
maserati,quattroporte,2007,ARG, 11/04/2016,Six figures on my QP's odometer,5,"First off, one needs to realize that owning one of these cars isn't going to be like owning any of its German competitors. Parts and service costs are higher, wait times are longer for parts and consumables like brakes and tires will go at double the rate they would on an S-Class or 7er. That said, the fifth gen QP (in Automatica spec) has proven itself in the field of reliability. My own car, an '07 Sport GT Automatica, has a shade over 100K on the clock at the time of this review and everything works as it should and the car still feels well screwed together. Yes, the quality of some of the interior trim is not quite as good as the Germans, however the hide on the seats holds up very well and the seats are supremely comfortable on long hauls. My only wish would be that they would raise up a bit higher to allow better legroom and a little bit more thigh support would be nice. Otherwise, no complaints about comfort at all. The suspension system does have a tendency to eat bushings rather quickly and they're expensive to replace and handling can become a bit ""wet noodle-like"" over certain imperfect roads but I put that down to my car needing new Skyhook strut assemblies. Maintenance is very straightforward; a major service every two years which covers all fluids and filters and both belts and otherwise just keep up with oil changes every 5K miles. The only major engine issue you may face is replacement of the intake cam timing variators which, if done out of warranty, is a $9K job at the Maz dealer. My car had them done at 54K miles and once they're done, they're done for good as the new parts are re-designed. Otherwise, the ZF six speed is bulletproof as are the electronics with the exception of a few niggles here and there but those can just as easily happen to any German car too. So in summary, if you've always wanted one, do yourself a favor and get one! They're tremendous value now that depreciation has taken its toll and as long as you have either a competent (and fair) dealer or a good Italian car indie nearby, you'll have no problem using this car every day. Just be prepared for frequent replacement of the rear tires and brakes. Remember, go into Italian car ownership with expectations set! It might be more maintenance but as they say, nothing beautiful is easy to keep!

Update as of 5/7/17: still going strong, front end bushes have all been replaced along with anti roll bar bushes and also had front skyhook strut assemblies overhauled with new bushes, spring pads and upper mounts. Front end now tight as a drum and I figure on seeing this car through to 200K miles barring any major failures, of which I expect none.

UPDATE: 117K Miles as of November 2017 still going strong with no failures and four big trips this year. 200K here we come!

UPDATE: 124K Miles as of May 2018. No issues whatsoever save for one oil leak fixed at the recent oil change (o-ring on the oil level sending unit in the oil pan and also valve cover gaskets replaced). Still love the car, still as reliable as anyone could ask, still beautiful!

UPDATE: 139K miles as of November 2019 and still no major issues. Had to put a drivers door window regulator in which I would expect any car of this age and mileage to need at some point and I did have to replace the drivers door main window switch pack as one of the buttons came loose but other than that the car is still flawless. Edmunds must have been reading my mind as I was just thinking the other day what a great car it is and this morning I got an email in my inbox asking me to update my review. Still feel the same way about the car, plan to drive it until it is no longer practical and will probably just replace it with a newer version of the same car.

Smoother, quieter, even better inside and out.  Love the 20-inch wheels, the suspension and gearing in sport mode, and my wife loves the full automatic.  This car gets lots of attention - my wife reports she gets more attention in this car than out of it!  Handles perfectly, tremendous power and responsiveness in both automatic and manual modes.

I have owned 2 Lambos, 2 Ferarri 360s, an S600, an Arnage, a 745Li, and the QP is the best all around car I've ever owned. It is built along side the 612 Scaglietti and the minute you drive it you can feel Ferrari in its blood stream. The understated elegance and amazing drive train/suspension make this car my top choice in a crowded field of luxo/performance sedans. Mercedes and BMW simply don't have a clue compared to the Italians!  "

Thinking I was under the radar in a 'sedan' I get thumbs up from every male between 12-60 years old.  Super cushy interior, roomy back seat for passengers, cool analog clock in the dash make this a sylish ride.  Beating every souped up honda off the line with a light push of the gas pedal also has its perks.  Trunk space seems limited, weird portholes on the side made my mom comment it looks like a Buick (thanks mom).  Gas mileage in sport mode is a whopping 9 mpg, 12+ in regular mode, but it's not as fun.  Best things my kids like are the ability to control the passenger seat from the rear center console.

maserati,quattroporte,2007,Limacs, 01/08/2008,Maserati QP is a Four Door Ferrari,4,"I recently purchased the fully loaded Executive GT Duoselect QP by Maserati. To me, QP is a Four Door Ferrari.  It's got all the power it has in a 8 cylinder ferrari plus more interior space.  It rockets to 60mph in just 5.2 seconds and it has the most comfortable frictionless left and right turns you can make with any upscale sedans.  Its got the sexiest engine noise you will ever hear in any car (since ferrari makes Maserati) and has brembo brakes that won't let you down when you really need it.  The exterior design of QP is absolutely beautiful and it turn heads wherever you go.  The only problem I have is the cabin noise.  It is not as quite a Lexus or Merc."
maserati,quattroporte,2007,philr43, 07/04/2013,Bad news,4,"It is with great disappointment that I have to report that a car I have enjoyed greatly for two and a half years was shown upon it's 62500 mile service to be suffering from very severe chassis corrosion. The Masarati Quatroporte 2007 is a brilliantly engineered and great looking car but sadly of inferior build quality. 

Having been so impressed prior to this service inspection I was ready to put in an order for the new Ghibli Maserati
however now some assurance that build quality has improved is necessary, also I expect other owners to cars of similar age to mine to be advised to have a inspection done. This may catch corrosion in time and preclude the great expense of chassis replacement."
maserati,quattroporte,2007,jdt, 09/10/2007,Maserati... Not Ready for Prime Time!,3,"I bought my car in May and it's been in the shop for a total of 3 out of the 4 months I've had it.  Computer problems, leak in interior (that Maserati can't reproduce but is reproduced every time it rains), bad CD player.  The quality of the car is poor and Maserati does not have the maintenance supply set-up to handle mass produced cars. (They're used to Ferrari owners whose cars aren't needed on a daily basis.)  For example, it took 2 weeks just to get the window leak fixed.  While the engine and the handling of the car are excellent, Maserati is 5 years behind in terms of electronics and gadgetry that is common on most other mid and high end vehicles.  I do not recommend this car! "

It is one of the best features of this car, smooth and very easy to master.  I have owned BMWs, MBs, Jags. Nothing attracts as much attention on the road.  It may be one of the most beautiful cars ever built!  The engine sounds terrific (it is difficult to keep the revs below 4-5000 rpms on the upshifts, the engine is so willing to sing) and the interior would put a Bentley to shame. Gas mileage has averaged about 14 mpg overall.  No problems so far after 2 months and 2800 miles.  I would highly recommend this car for anyone who wants a car with real personality.   "
maserati,quattroporte,2008,Minneapolitan, 12/03/2008,Better than expected,4,"I was very much ready to lease my third S class when I decided that I should at least explore the possibility of a Quattroporte. Now I cannot fathom ever buying from the Germans again.  The car was bought for the looks and sporting credentials but I have been surprised by the quality and reliability. Despite the 20 in wheels the car rides well in the city where it spends most of its time. On the freeway there is plenty of power on tap though the car is downright lazy compared to the AMGs of my past. Regardless, the car is so well balanced, I prefer it. I've always loved cars but now I really love MY car."
maserati,quattroporte,2008,Bob, 10/04/2016,A true Motorhead's car!,5,"I'm an old motorhead, former race driver, etc., having owned many performance cars over the years.  I had a 2003 Mercedes-Benz CL600 for 5 years and it was braking the bank!  For reliability, it was the worst car I have ever owned!  I looked for many months for a good replacement and also decided to go with a 4 door car.  I found a stunning bespoken 2008 Quattroporte Executive GT car with the most beautiful paint job . . . ever.  It has the very rare ""blu malogo"" paint.  For our crappy road conditions in California I believe that 18"" wheels would have given a more comfortable ride.  My 19"" wheels are a bit too stiff, with their low profile.  The 4.2 Ferrari V8 performs quite well, especially when you give it some revs.  Keep in mind, this is a street car, not a track car and you will be very satisfied.  One of the best things I discovered, after owning it for three years, is that, so far, it has been extremely reliable.  In fact the only problem that I had was the driver's window-regulator had to be replaced.  I chose the 2008 model over newer ones because I thought it best represented the true Maserati sedan styling, such as the classic grille, headlights and tail lights.  So far . . . this sweet sedan is a keeper!

Its styling, by the legendary Pininfarina, shows them all how it should be done, without tricks. The lines are so shapely they're striking.   Its cabin is roomy for a car this low and stylish, but it's really all about the quality of its materials, with nine shades of leather and six types of wood to choose from. The controls could and should be simpler, but that's true of all the top luxury cars today.  "

At first, the car looked stunning in the dealer. I took a test drive, and it drove well on the streets. I wanted to experiment with Maserati. I thought this car was great, until I saw the Mercedes Benz CLS 63 AMG. My lease was nearing an end, and I already had complaints with the car. The rear seat comfort was not acceptable. I didn't realize this, since I am normally the one driving. Also, the Navigation malfunctioned. The power is lacking compared to my former Mercedes Benz E55 AMG. Overall, I think it was a good experience to try the Maserati, because now I now to stick with Mercedes AMG."

It's basically a four door Ferrari - With power, melody, practicability and comfort. The car has only been driven once a week for leisure, and was parked in the garage for the most of the time. I've never done any repair except every 3000 miles oil change an semi annual service tune up. Just like another review,  the only complain I have for this car was the distance between the gas and brake paddles, they are too close to each other. Other than that, this is a great vehicle. ***Still runs strong. ***

This is the first car I have not thought twice about getting. I knew I wanted one. So, back to the QP. The car is a dream to drive. Seriously. A head-turner and a rubber-burner. The car is fast, but I never can really ""open 'er up"" on the freeway. Which really stinks. In any case, the car is great looking and sounding, inside and out. But with all great things, there are a few kinks Maserati should iron out. "

I'm still pinching myself.  The wife took my last car and traded in her Cad EXT for a Honda Civic Hybrid which she promptly gave to me..  Fuel econ driving up to the Bay area was better than I had read.  Taking into account the grapevine and the occasional tendency to do well over the speed limit. lol.  I do have to agree with a prior review.  The fuel and brake pedals are too close.  Remember to make a concerted effort in braking.  Otherwise you can find yourself in a whole heap of trouble real fast.  

After a year and a half.  I have found this model with the 4.7 Ferrari engine to be bulletproof.  I do not abuse it, and it has been very dependable.

Incredibly quick, quiet, smooth, & gorgeous! Only two minor complaints:1-the lane change lever is too far from the steering wheel and behind too large paddle shifters. 2-accelerator & brake are too close together. We haven't been able to activate my bluetooth phone and I'm 90 miles from the dealer so we're dealing by phone!                                                    "

Car has run very well as a daily driver averaging 15k miles per year. Has broken down only 2x in 6yrs. Every breakdown is expensive; $2.7k for alternator failure; $2.4k for coolant hose to heat exchanger failure (behind engine). Overall a great car; technology could use major upgrades. Looks like a new model QP and runs just as good as new! Only complaint would be horrible suspensions parts - have gone through 3 sets of bushings and ball joints which last around 30-40k miles before replacement is needed from banging over potholes and bad roads. Rotors can be hand turned 1x, 2nd time needs replacement - spent $2,500 for brake job last summer replacing all 4 rotors and pads. Rotors are very expensive. Set aside $2,000/yr for maintenance.

maserati,quattroporte,2011,Maserati Man, 04/28/2017,The Black Panther,5,"It is very the most beautiful car on the road, still! Definitely buy the 2010-2012 years Quattroporte-S with the 4.7. Talk to the dealer mechanics and the sales pros, the 4.7 engine is bullet proof. It drives and handles way better than either a Jag XJ or Mercedes E550 or S series. Truly fun to drive and you can get 22 mpg at 75 mph on long hauls. There is no need to dog it in sport mode, why? From 40 mph to 120 mph+, the car is really quick in normal mode. I bought my 2011 in July 2016 with 12k miles and have put 9k trouble free miles, I choose to change the oil every 6k miles and use a German synthetic called Liqimali, my exotic repair specialist recommends it, better than American synthetics. Every time we take this car on a trip we always get horns honking, thumbs up, and people want to know what it is, most incredible car I have ever owned. Very satisfied.

maserati,quattroporte,2011,Maserati Man 2, 06/21/2018,Maserati Man 2,4,"The driving experience is like no other 200"" Sedan with 4 doors. Amazing, you feel like you are driving a coupe, which ironically the Gran Turismo is and they use the QP platform. The 4.7 engine + the 6 speed ZF tranny is as good as it gets, and the paddle shifters are very user friendly in sport mode. The quality of the materials is top notch inside, the leather is way more durable than the Jaguars and BMW's we have had, the Mercedes E and S Class are almost as good. The navigation sucks as does the Bluetooth. I did not buy the car for these items, if they are very important to you, this car is not for you. The maintenance is not bad except you are forced to buy the parts (air filter, oil filter, light replacements, etc...) from the dealer. You can't buy Maserati parts at retail outlets like Autozone or O'Reilly's for  instance. The bushings are another hidden issue that creep up on you, because the car weighs 4389 lbs,  if you run the car hard you will be replacing them and other suspension parts in less than 30,000 miles. I bought mine with 12K miles 2 years ago and will hit 29K miles this weekend. Will put front brakes on at 30K. Have Michellin Pilot Super Sport tires and hope to get 15K to 17K miles off them. May have to get an SRT or Hellcat next. Still love this car

M's, 5 Vettes and a few others I've built. The Sport GTS takes a few miles to learn to drive, and appreciate, but in Sport Mode, Manual shift using paddles it is absolutely excellent in every aspect. Handling - bearing in mind it is a 4400 lb car - is every bit as good if not better than my EX 2011 M3 with competition package, much smoother on corners than any Vette. and definitely not lacking on power. Granted it does not have all the stupid stuff no reasonable person would want (as offered with S550 or 7 series). But talk about attention getting. Wow! "
maserati,quattroporte,2014,Kevin Ode, 12/03/2015,The car is fantastic!.,5,"This car is absolutely fantastic!  It drives great, is blazingly fast (much faster than the specs would indicate) and inside and out gorgeous.  We have driven over 6k miles now and the quality is much better than expected (no rattles and everything feels solid; Feels German, looks Italian, great combo!).  There are only 2 complaints: 1) The 21"" wheels come only in summer tires (there are winter tires available, but why not great all weather tires, like my 911 has?), and the traction is terrible when temperatures are below 40.  You really have to deal with the nonsense of winter tires, even in Atlanta (must be the global warming...).

The 2nd and much bigger problem is the terrible support from the dealers.  We have 2 dealers here and they don't seem to be too interested in returning phone calls.  Even the Maserati Importer cannot get a hold of them.  Just go there, get in their face and they will tell you that the (simple) recall items will take 3 days to complete and they will give you a nicely equipped Mazda 6 as a loaner...  Their service is worse than that of a ""reasonably priced car"" dealer, absolutely unacceptable for a luxury car brand.  Maserati, please go see how Porsche, Mercedes, BMW and Audi do this.

I have seen many complaints about borrowed parts (such as the Navigation system and window buttons, which come from Chrysler), but I couldn't care less.  It all works well and other car companies (VW - Audi, Chevy - Cadillac etc.) do the exact same thing, no biggie.

Update: still loving car, Dealer support has been greatly improved. They now have Ghibli’s as loaners and response time is good.

Maintenance, as is to be expected, expensive: New tires, every 10 to 12,000 miles, $2500, oil change every 12,000 miles, $500, new brake pads every 20,000 miles, $1700 (front and rear).

maserati,quattroporte,2014,RJN, 03/06/2017,Haven't lost yet!,5,"My GTS is fast, very fast. 0-60 is less than 4 secs. Top end has exceeded 200 mph three times. Looks like a million and turns heads everywhere I go. Comfort on long trips is exceptional. Don't need the massaging seats. I am 75 and love to race anything at the right time. Have beaten Corvettes,  Mercedes and Porches'. So far unbeaten at any speed. I am very particular who and when I race. I will not put anyone in jeopardy and I am always alone. Sound system is extraordinaire. Bowers and Wilkens. This GTS has every option! and listed at over 175,000. I wouldn't buy a new one. Just waited a year and saved over $100,000. The best deal I have ever made on an automobile. Owned many classics and many race cars but this Maserati GTS is the best of both worlds. Have fun.

ZERO problems.

The Maserati is a drivers car, the wind noise at 60 and above is surprisingly loud but the roar of the engine is louder. My S550 was so comfortable, quiet, smooth & responsive but the day I traded it & I left the dealership in the Maserati I felt special. If you want a car that makes going to the market an event test drive a Quattroporte. One caveat though.... more expensive than my Benz for all service,parts & repair

But, my Jaguar XJL, at half the price, is more comfortable, spacious, tech forward, and stylish.  And this one is really a head turner.

So for style, comfort, pizzazz, it's the XJL.

But if you want a head turner with a race car spirit that is shear joy to drive, hear and walk out to morning and night then the QP6 should be at the very top of your list.  Forget the naysayers, I’ve found most negative reviews are from people who are either not really able to buy and retain the car, have jealousy issues and/or are looking for the car to be something it was never trying to be.

It has been about a year and I have now noticed a few small items that seem to be gremlins that my mechanics cannot figure out.  Because there are no dealers around here this has been a real pain.  I've also noticed some issues with the dash that should not happen on a car that costs this much.  I've had many cars before and never had a bubble form in the dash...but alas no warranty and no dealer so I guess I'm stuck with it.

2 years later: still a great car but does come with technical/mechanicals difficulties and if you do not have a dealer nearby that can properly service the car; it will cause you great complications.

maserati,quattroporte,2017,Ryan, 10/09/2019,Hated it!!,1,"While the allure of a big Ferrari engine and the luxury of a beautiful leather and carbon fiber interior seems like it should be love at first sight, the unfortunate truth is that this car also has some terrible flaws that you should be aware of. First and the worst is the Auto Stop/Start function. This gas saving feature is terrible and there is no quick and easy button anywhere to turn it off, instead you have to scroll through the menu on the steering wheel to find it and turn it off every time you get in the car. If not, when the engine stops at every light, the AC starts blowing warm air and it becomes very uncomfortable. Add to this the Air recirculate button does not stay engage, so you are greeted with warm exhaust. Whoever designed a pull out tray to put your phone on should be fired. It has a folding door that you can not close if you actually plug your phone into the car's USB outlet, why? Terrible design. The cup holders are too shallow and small to put your large iPhone in and there is no other place besides inside the center consul to put your phone. The Apple CarPlay integration is terrible to switch between it and the Maserati controls. 

Yes, it is fast, but it also feels uncontrolled. This is no Porsche 911. It is a monster and it drives like one. Add to that it gets about 8-10MPG and it will cost you a quarter tank of gas every time you go out to dinner. 

Went back to driving my 6 year old Volt and sold this POS at a local car auction for half what I paid for it just 16 months before. Worse car ever!!

The color is type of gray named as ""Grigio "". in side is mixed brown leather and silk by famous Italian suit designer Ermenegildo Zegna. It is a heavy large sedan. It is very roomy inside. Although there are few parts from Chrysler, but those mixed with very nice stitched leather, and it really doesn't bother me. I enjoy much every morning turning on the engine and hearing the load raspy sound of Ferrari built engine !  The seats are not too sporty like BMW or Porsche with lots of side support. They are just fine ! It takes time to learn how to use the shifter. Now after 9 months I am doing great on changing gears with shifter- no steering wheel shift paddle-  If you drive more than 30 miles a day you will pay much for gas, and need more maintenance , and maybe not a every day driving car !  You don't need to show off and push the sport button for loader engine note, other cars will slow down to just take a look. Many times I heard "" This is a really beautiful car "" !  Formidable luxury the original race-bred luxury sedan you can drive everyday- so far no single problem.  I pay about 6o $ every 2 weeks.

Very reliable with road couth for a high performer and still a head turner after 5 years on the road.  Creature comforts but will still make the hair on the back of the neck of the dude in front of you raise up as he respectfully pulls over into the slow lane.

Has hooks a for child seat.  My four year old LOVES to ride in it. She calls it Daddy's ""race car"" and urges me to go faster.  So far it has been extremely reliable.  It did have one major repair, the clutch.  This was probably from pervious owner abuse, but dealer replaced entire clutch under warranty - which, by the way, is five years! "

It is an absolute pleasure to drive.  I love the sound of the exhaust and the acceleartion is breathtaking, just don't floor it on wet pavement.  In automatic mode the shifts are very clunky and need to be smoothed out.  The paddle shifting in sport mode is a blast and is extremely fast at high rpm.  Maserati needs more dealerships.  Mine is two hours away and I'm in an urban area. I have had a major failure of the cambio gearbox twice, requiring towing from the freeway (scary), and two weeks in the shop each time.  I think one more will qualify my car for the lemon law.  I love the car, though I'd really hesitate to get another one, given the gearbox failures."

maserati,coupe,2004,RMK, 12/02/2004,True Exotic Sports Car,4,"WOW! Get behind the wheel of a Maserati Coupe Cambiocorsa and you will understand the hype and accolades. I turned in a Porsche 911 C4S to buy one. I have driven a BMW M3, BMW M5, and the Porsche, and the Maserati is definetely the most fun of them all to drive. The M5 felt more refined and had more spontaneous raw power (6 speed), and the Porsche was all around more precise and smooth, but the Maserati is a true sports car!  It has great power and handling with the most appealing looks. It has a great exhaust and engine sound even without the tubi exhaust.  The F1 paddles gives the driver a formula track feel. Everyone stares at this Italian beauty.  If you can, indulge.  As Ferris Bueller would say, I would highly recommend one for anyone who can afford to buy one!"

It's sound is peerless. The feeling of the climbing revs is better than the most exquisite foot massage. The interior is impeccably and tastefully finished. Although it's a no-gadget car, it is not in the slightest utilitarian (as is the competition). It is  the best value car of its class. The head mechanic says it's a Ferrari at half the price (this engine is put into the F360, mfg'd by Maserati) Sweet!"
maserati,coupe,2004,Juan Colombo, 11/29/2006,"Style, Class and Fun",4,"A car that does not drive itself, it requires an understanding of standard shifting.  This car is hungry for speed, but once you get acquainted with it provides a fun driving experience even at low urban speeds.  The engine is a Ferrari, so you are driving the best there is.  It is surprisingly spacious for 4 passengers even as it looks definitely like a sport coupe.  Quality design and finishes are noticeable throughout."

maserati,coupe,2005,Tom R, 07/07/2006,Bonding with my Maserati Coupe,4,"Just completed a 2,100 mile round trip from Florida to Tennessee.  During this time I got a chance to experience everything the Maserati has to offer.  My car was extremely comfortable on long highway in Florida and Georgia were I averaged 80 mph. The Skyhook suspension is amazing, even with ultra low profile performance tires the ride is never harsh in normal or sport mode.  In Tennessee on the curvy mountain roads the Shyhook suspension kept the car flat and predictable.  It is much easier to drive at high speeds in the curves than my wife's Corvette.  Its overall gas mileage for the trip was 21.2 mpg, which is really not too bad especially with the aggressive driving done in TN.   "
maserati,coupe,2005,John F., 05/07/2018,"Everyone should own one, but only briefly.",4,"This car reminds me of the joke about yacht owners:  the two happiest days in a yacht owner's life are the day he or she buys it, and the day he or she sells it.  Owning a Coupe teaches you any number of advanced-level life lessons:  you have to pay to play; be careful what you wish for; and Italian cars really are as good and bad as people say they are.  It's a remarkably affordable exotic, considering its prestige value and premium drivetrain, but mine lived up to its Italian-ness.  During the thirteen months I owned it, it was in the shop every month or two, all but once for minor things.  And the funny thing was, I didn't really mind--until one day the car's bad points outweighed its good points and I decided to bail.  The only big repair was replacing the clutch, and I knew going in that they're good for about 20k miles on average.  You really need to know a good independent repair shop--having a dealer replace the clutch would have been three or four times as expensive.  Aside from that, the drivetrain is reliable and appears bulletproof.  It's the small bits that are always breaking in your hand or falling off.  Don't buy a Coupe just for its acceleration or handling:  it's fast (and makes great noises), but there's faster, and while the factory sorted out the handling by the end of the model run, they're too heavy to handle great.  It's a GT, and a striking one at that, with even more personality than the GranTurismo that replaced it in 2008.  Additional perk:  people will think you paid way more for it than you did.  Besides eating clutches, the Cambiocorsa automated manual has a few rough edges, but I loved it--it shifts with *authority*.  And by all means, do not--repeat, DO NOT--actually drive the car.  Put miles on it and its value plummets.  I bought mine with 12.5k, put 8k on it in one year, and took a beating when I disposed of it.  I guess the market expects these cars to be garage queens.  Maintenance costs, while frequent, aren't terribly expensive when done by an independent shop, but judging by how impressed the local Maserati dealership was by all my repair receipts, I get the feeling many owners just live with the broken bits and pieces.  Finally, be aware that the market for these cars is extremely thin.  That's why you get an apparent (but largely illusory) discount on these cars when you buy, and why you give a very real discount when you sell.

maserati,coupe,2005,e, 01/20/2008,Ever see a lemon on wheels?,3," First a blowout then the sensors couldn't differentiate between a stop sign, red light and intentional turn off of the car. The result was the car spent more time in the shop and with AAA roadside assistance or Maz roadside assistance than on the road with me. The little gear shift is easily broken (esp by valets @ $1500 a pop ) and you can get service for an easy $500-800 anytime it is due. The 1st 2000 miles were awesome. The rest absolutely stunk and I felt extremely insecure. Maybe if I rotated the tires every 5k miles it would have handled better but this turkey is not recommended. "

It has software problems that cause stalling and no real answer. For $80,000 or there abouts, it is a bit rough (and I am just referring to the time it takes on the phone).

useful and holds two children.  I find 
myself looking for places to drive in

My neighbor has a New BMW M5 with the V10 505 HP engine, and although it is a bit quicker than the Gransport or my Quattroporte, it doesn't come close to the feel of driving an Italian piece of hand crafted artwork. Keep in mind my Maserati, even after two years, sees the mechanics only for routine service, whereas the M5...well, let's just say it is a very lonely automobile, constantly craving companionship at the dealer. The biggest bonus is the sound...nobody can duplicate the sound of a Ferrari engine (yes it is a Ferrari engine) purring...just waiting to pounce.  It's like listening to a symphony at the Hollywood Bowl.  This car is pure sex appeal on wheels!    "

All the cars are stunningly beautiful, ferocious driving machines, and comfortable GT cruisers.  The problems with transmission that were evident on the 3200 (pre GranSport) have been fully resolved to the point where Ferraris now use Maserati's Cambiocorsa F1 transmission.  The ride is smooth unless you utilize Sport mode, which also acts as a volume and power control for the exhaust system.  Responce is superb, shifting is fast, acceleration is amazing for a 4.2 liter v8.  Compare the GS to the v8s of other makers, and you will wonder why non-Italian builders bother trying!"

When a friend suggested I look at a Gransport or Gran Turismo, I drove them both and loved both of them. Easy to say, the Turbo is much faster but the Gransport is just much more satisfying. I chose the Gransport for a couple reasons; 1st, at $32k it's an incredible value 2nd, it's lighter and unless you buy the 4.7, the GT feels much slower.  The sound, the engine flexibility, the way it revs... it's just an awesome vehicle. You hear, usually from internet warriors who've no idea what they are talking about, that these are unreliable or poorly made but my experience has been the complete opposite. I'm not sure if there is a real downside to this car, the stereo sucks but seriously is that even worth mentioning?

maserati,gransport,2006,Italian Rosso, 07/30/2007,True Sports GT,4,"The vehicle while not a Ferrari, is a very liveable sports car.  In 'Normal' mode it drives refined, much smoother than expected.  In 'sport' mode it gets going in a hurry, with shifting up like a madman (I am not sure if the new automatic transmission is as fast) and the roar of a jet. It has no trouble handling BMW 6 Series Ms or most Mercedes Benz AMGs through the mountains.  While its 400 horsepower seems light compared to the V10s or massive V8s of MB those cars are also have several hundred pounds heavier than the Maser. While not a Ferrari, it is infinitely liveable, and has the hp/weight ratio comparable to the best in its class."

Even with the top down on the highway you can carry on a conversation without raising your voice.  It's a one of a kind vehicle that draws a lot of attention.  In sport mode, the Cambiocorsa gearshift works beautifully; it's a bit sluggish in normal mode.  Turn off the MSP and it definitely lays rubber down.  The seats are supportive and comfortable.  The automatic soft top is a very nice feature.  I wish it had a better stereo, that's about my only real complaint."

If you need four seats and a supercar you can use everyday, this is it. I own and have owned several BMWs, Ferraris and Maseratis, and the Gransport is one of the best balanced cars I've ever had.

I attended the Master Maserati Driving school, which used mostly Gransports.  I was amazed at how stable the car was on the Road Atlanta race course.  It was almost impossible to get into driving trouble. I saw the spy photos of the new Maserati Coupe for late 2007/2008 and thought the car was going too large and too much like a 2-door Quattroporte, despite the 470 (est) horsepower.  So my warranty was running out and I purchased a new 2006 Gransport LE. I could not be happier or be having more fun. It seems to me, that if you want a true GT coupe, who wants bigger rear seats."

It's quick in the straights, brakes well, and quick in the curves, but it lacks the swiftness and agility of a track car like say, the Porsche GT3 or Lotus Elise. Although this is probably good, it's soft over bumps yet turns in sharply on the corners. F1 shifting is very fun, hitting 0-62 in 4.9 seconds an the needle swings to higher sppeds very quickly. The seats are comfy an hold you in while manuvering like a fighter jet and look, oh so nice. Hit the sport button an the sound of the exhaust becomes a beautiful symphony.

After my third blow out late at night in a not so wonderful location I purchased the inflatable spare kit from the dealer. It takes up about 1/t the trunk and cost over $2000.

I was looking real grand touring auto, something for trips to the Lake, Chicago and Kentucky.  This new GranTurismo fills the bill for me. The only drawback I can find so far is the seats tend to get really hot when parked in the sun and take a while to cool off (Bourdeaux).  Ventilated seats would be a great option."
maserati,granturismo,2008,Kevin Dorgan, 02/28/2009,Prop shaft defect,3,"Stunning looking vehicle and quite rare to have 4 usable seats in this style of car. Gear box is excellent in manual sport mode, brakes only average, perhaps a little under powered, but no doubt S model will resolve these issues. It really is a joy to drive long and short distances. Engine has an enjoyable sound and in most areas it does what it was designed to do, and really quite well. However I have experienced unacceptable problems with the prop shaft. The vehicle is presently having its fifth shaft fitted. The rear tires are also wearing unevenly and at an unacceptable rate. Maserati has not been able so far to identify the cause or solution to the problem."
maserati,granturismo,2008,The Sexy Italian, 04/29/2008,Everyday Driver,5,"A bargain considering Pininfarina styling and Ferrari based technology with a 4yr/50,000 mile warranty.  The 2+2 seating is larger than the BMW 6 series and the hand assembled interior is awesome.  Of course, the engine sound is intoxicating and everyday driving is a pleasure.  I enjoy this car more than my 911 and Lamborghini Gallardo."
maserati,granturismo,2008,Palo Alto, 10/21/2008,Most Excellent,4,"You must see this car in person. Photos do not due it justice. Rarely does a day go by when someone doesn't stare or yell out the window about my car. This is the ultimate executive car. Comfortable, luxurious and fun. Back seat can fit 2 full size adults but, the car does not look large from the outside.  Interior is so Italian. No German car can match. The best part, no one else has one."
maserati,granturismo,2009,Paul, 07/07/2010,King of its category,4,"Driven BMW 645, 750, 545, Mercedes 550, Porsche Boxtser Spyder and many, many more.  Rolled the 550 and Porsche immediately following a test drive of the S.  Never regretted the move, the car is special and if having to respond constantly while driving what type of car this is I'll take that as cost of ownership.  Wonderful ride each and every day on the road."
maserati,granturismo,2010,lionking730, 10/01/2011,"Nice looking, great customer support, but question mark on Reliability",4,"Got mine in June 2010 and after 15 months, I only put 2600 miles on it. However, ENGINE light came up twice in the 13th month, 1st time it was cleared by computer but 2nd time, had to have it towed to dealer to fix a faulty valve. Then within last 3 weeks, I had both side mirror's glass piece separated from the base/frame with cord attached (driver side first then passenger side 3 days later). Dealer said same mirror glass problem only happened to some 2010 models, I guess I am the ""lucky""one to have both sides failed. They determined that the adhesive between glass piece and base was weak, new replacements had them glued together. Well, funny issue with this luxury car."
maserati,granturismo,2011,maser4me, 02/26/2012,2012 GranTurismo,4,"I recently owned a BMW M6 for 3 years and looked at several cars (Jag XK-RS), AMG-C63, Porsche 911) before buying the Maserati.
Other cars are faster, but the GranTurismo is an exotic compared to the rest. The interior is better than the other cars I looked at, only the Jag comes close. As far as gadgets the Maserati does not provide all that the M6 did (Heads Up Display, multiple levels of tuning the suspension and gear box). The engine is the difference with this car, exhaust note and torque. The sport mode can be felt instantly in the tighter suspension and throttle response.
The paint finish is higher quality than the rest, leather is also a notch above. Color combo is great too !"
maserati,granturismo,2011,the_owl, 09/30/2011,Equal parts of fun and class,4,"I normally research a new car to death before making a purchase.
All it took with this car was starting the engine one time.
The exhaust note negates the need for the high end stereo, the exterior lines are sensual, and the luxurious interior is comfortable with four adults.
I have owned the car for two months and it is always parked front and center by parking valets, who I have seen scuffle for the chance to drive it.
This car is elegant, perfect for anyone who wants the performance of an exotic without the ego of a Ferrari or Lambo.
Fair warning, it will be photographed, people will mill around it, and pretty women will smile at you.
Buyer beware!"
maserati,granturismo,2011,slimbob, 04/22/2011,I love my maserati,4,"I drive a red maserati s automatic and love it. I also have the cadillac CTS-V wagon, which is much faster, but the maserati blows it away in style, class and fun. No car in this class can match the purrrrr of the ferrari engine and the beautiful lines of this car. Only Italians can build a car like this!"
maserati,granturismo,2011,mastersj, 02/26/2011,Great used buy luxury GT but slow car,3,"I love this car except it is VERY SLOW and heavy and lacks the performance of similar cars like the Mercedes SL63 AMG and BMW M6. I mean come on Maserati, 0-60 in 5.1 seconds! Thats slow as can be considering my BMW M3 costs half as much and is much faster!

Also, Maserati drops like a rock in value. Best bet is to buy a
1-2 year old car and save 50%! The looks and interior are superior however to BMW and Mercedes in price point however! So if you want a great cruiser and not a performance coupe, Maserati is the ticket. Otherwise, I would look at an AMG Mercedes like the CL63 AMG or SL63 AMG or maybe a Porsche 911 Turbo for same amount of money. Perhaps even an Aston Martin V12 Vantage."
maserati,granturismo,2011,Akinwumi Aladesawe MD, 06/04/2019,What’s not to love,5,"Absolutely gorgeous rolling sculpture with looks that can make a grown man cry
Designed by the famed Pininfarina and with a Ferrari sourced engine that sounds out of this world 
Buy a well maintained low mileage one at the lowest curve of depreciation and you have a winner"
maserati,granturismo,2011,Kboyz, 07/26/2019,Love mine,5,I bought an S coupe last year with less than 30k. It is the most comfortable car I have ever been in. Sounds great and while it isn’t as fast as some of the other high end cars out there it is more than fast enough and drives like a dream. Being 8 years old the price I paid was very reasonable compared to what they are brand new. 
maserati,granturismo,2013,tekman69, 06/16/2013,Two cars in One,5,"I have driven sports cars in the 60-100K range before, and have enjoyed the speed yet didn't always enjoy the stiff suspension driving on the pot hole filled streets and highways in and around New York City.
 I just upped the ante and purchased a new 2013 Maserati Granturismo Sport about 1000 miles ago and it is worth every last penny and then some.
This is two cars in one.
A sports car with plenty of power, great handling and a sound that you never get tired of (sport on).
This car is beautiful and will not get old. But the absolute best thing about this car is a push button on the dash that turns this car into the most comfortable long distance luxury tourer for the entire family of 4"
maserati,granturismo,2014,Charlie Hawkins, 03/25/2016,The best care we have ever owned!,5,"We love this car more than anything we have owned yet and that includes the Porsche 911 Cabriolet, Range Rover HSE, Mercedes s550 and BMW 7 series. 
First of all, the thing is just drop dead gorgeous. We bought ours in White with the Pearl Beige leather interior with the black dash and accents. The car has plenty of horsepower (454 hp) and lots and lots of torque. The sound of this engine is like nothing else we have heard from other manufacturers. Throaty and sensual, loud but still classy.  You can keep the sound lower if you stay out of SPORT mode (which opens electronic baffles in the exhaust, adjusts suspension, for speed and cornering (adjusts shock and other components),  changes the electronic mapping for the ZF transmission shift points and advances ECU) mapping a kin to putting a ""chip"" in the ECU. pretty cool! Dou you know what I would have been willing to pay for that if it was an option? Lots of money. Luckily its standard. The cars handling is great, its heavier than the 911 but much more predictable on the edge because the engine is in the front.
This Maserati allows us to take our kids (middle school and high school) with us at any time because there is plenty of room in the back seats. Small to medium sized adults are fine too. The front seats automatically (+ electronically) slide forward to create a comfortable in/out process for a two door, four passenger car. The trunk is not optimal for a Costco run, that's what a bigger car or truck is for anyway. In my opinion, this car is a sports car with eye-popping good looks that provides the luxury ride when needed and its a back road eating exotic when desired. 
We loaned it to our friend for a couple of days and when she brought it back, she said ""the only way I can describe this car is that its like great sex! , I have to buy one"".
Btw, we have not had a single problem with the car in the 2 years we owned it. Its been to the dealer once for a scheduled maintenance.
"
maserati,granturismo,2014,Rob, 11/08/2017,Have owned them all and LOVE the Mas G-T,4,"I have always purchased cars as a true car and driving enthusiast vs. any status considerations.  After my BMW phase (Z4, 7-series, X5) came my MBz phase (ML, CLS, E, S) and then my Porsche Phase (Panamera, 911, Cayenne, Macan) and then the Jag phase.  The 911 and Panamera are great cars but the 911 is not a touring car and has no real backseat or cargo room (just had to have one once) and the Panamera's overall styling, especially the side view, didn't hold my interest. The Jag F-Type V8 was very good overall and I enjoyed this car more than the others, especially the exhaust sound, power and overall styling.  However, with consideration to drive comfort, power, sound and overall styling, the Maserati GranTurismo is my favorite so far.  State of the art technology is not my primary reason for buying a car of this nature, as long as it has the basic requirements such as parking sensors, navigation, etc. and the Maserati G-T does, excepting a rear view camera and blind spot detection which I truly miss in this car.  The car feels much heavier than the others but provides a truly comfortable ride and it is a beautiful car.  In ICE mode, I recently got 25-26 mpg on a 100 mile highway trip which was a pleasant surprise.  Have not had the car long enough to assess maintenance or reliability (bought it used as second owner), but I am expecting huge eventual costs for tires, brakes, etc.
"
maserati,granturismo,2015,Ghalib Wardak, 03/15/2016,"Good from far, far from good.",4,"Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic vehicle, a true head turner. Engine sounds, driving, control fantastic. Acceleration: can be improved. Major disappointment: electronics. No kidding, my Prius has much better technology in terms of sound, stereo, blue tooth connectivity, etc. I honestly feel the GTS technology is at least 10 years behind time. At 120+ K price....I want everything....just a fantastic drive is not enough. Had I known how crippling the electronics are, I would have opted against GTS. Thank god for iPhone.
"
maserati,granturismo,2017,Dr. Mark Edward Hatfield, 03/01/2018,Beautiful Italian Beast,5,"I researched this car for years before purchasing. What has emerged is an incredibly reliable automobile that has the perfect blend of refined luxury and a sensual, thrilling driving experience that you can share with another couple. The silhouette is classical pininfarini svelt. Fit and finish is superb. The cabin wraps you in fine Italian leather that fits like tailored suit. The electronics needs updating (add a backup camera and interface smart phone and you are all set) but the sound will arouse your primal instincts every time you hear it. Paint is what you expect from Ferrari and power gets to the rear wheels like a race horse claws at the ground. Destined to stand the test of time and reveal itself as a pinicle of automotive engineering.
"
maserati,granturismo,2017,Stuart, 02/21/2019,Sexyist sounding car and beautiful,5,"This is an exotic car through and through!  I was in the market for a Porsche 911 but by stroke of luck saw this beautiful 2012 Maserati Granturismo S with only 24k miles.  Never considered owning a Maserati because this car MSRP was $135,000.  The quality of this car is incredible, 4.7 LTR Ferrari Engine which is stunning when you pop the hood.  The only negative, wish it had a backup and forward camera but that can be added. The front of this car is classic, just love looking at it.  Maintenance is in line with other exotic brands but only scheduled every 2 years.  I add an oil change every year.  Costs can be reduced by buying oil, filter, engine air filter and cabin air filter.  I change the air filters myself and have the dealership change the oil/filter labor only and they do a multi point inspection free to make sure everything looks good.  By doing some maintenance myself and provided oil/filter almost cuts costs in half.  Driving the GTS is an experience and turns heads. I had a Corvette driver come up to me and said it was beautiful and the best sounding car!
"
maserati,granturismo,2017,Tridente , 12/04/2020,Best grand tourer ever,5,"Best sounding V8 ever made. Timeless Pininfarina design. Great comfort during long journeys at very high speed (up to 187Mph). Amazing steering and cornering. Handcraftmanship not easily found in modern production. Wonderful materials and build quality. 
"
maserati,spyder,2002,mike mansour, 11/20/2007,Itallian beast,4,"I purchased my Spyder used in august of 2005 and it has been my daily driver ever since. The thrust of the V8 is incredible and the sound is very satisfying. The electric top neatly stows in within seconds. I previously owned a 2002 BMW M3 convertible, and their is no comparison. My M3 struggled in winter driving as I live in Minnesota, but the skyhook suspension on the Maserati makes winter driving suprisingly pleasant, I have driven this car through the 2 winters without a problem. The customer service could be better with Maserati, my car has had numerous problems with the windshield wiper motor, and needed to be replaced, but thats it, great car would highly recommend."
maserati,spyder,2002,Vinny Deglisitelli, 04/03/2002,Sexy Italian Beast,5,"I recently bought this car trading in 
my 2000 Jaguar XK-Series. My Jaguar was 
a great car too but I did not care for 
the GPS. I paid more for this car then 
I should have due to the shipping in to 
the US from Italy. This is a great car, 
though it is not a family car. So for 
my wife I bought her the S80 T6, in my 
opinon it is one of the better luxury 
marquees. Supposedly Maserati will 
release a sedan around the same size as 
the Mercedes S-Class, which should be 
nice."
maserati,spyder,2002,joseph Herman, 08/10/2002,Just One Problem,4,"Everything about the car has been up 
to, or exceeded my expectations. I have 
been very surprised by how many people 
recognize this rare and unfamiliar car, 
and by the number of unsolicited 
compliments I have been getting from 
total strangers. The most frequent 
remark is about how elegant the car 
looks on the street, compared to 
photographs."
maserati,spyder,2002,Maserati Spyder, 11/11/2005,Ferrari substitute?,4,"Dealer service was expensive but good, and many items were upgraded and checked. Engine is wonderful both in appearance and performance. Wide rev range and great Ferrari sound over 5K. A chain belt gives a Ferrari- designed engine performance without the superexpensive belt changes.Interior is beautiful, throttle progressive, brakes good, steering and clutch light, but first and second gear are baulky. Free dealer upgrade helped a bit, but still not as good as Porsche. Scuttle shake is the only other issue, especially when starting off for some reason, but overall this is a super secondhand value and a fun ride. "

Spyder.  They arrived at the same 
time and I test drove them back to 
back.  The plastic interior, cheap 
feeling switchgear and contrived 
exterior design of the SL compared 
poorly with the Maserati (and with the 
previous SL).  The real difference 
was in the driving.  The SL was 
subdued and perfect-- the Maseati 
was alive and fun! "

maserati,spyder,2002,JBerto, 04/24/2002,Great Car,4,"Last car I droe was a 996 cabriolet, 
and it doesn't compare to this. I've 
been a Porsche fan for my whole life, 
and have owned 3 overall, but would 
rather have my Maserati. My wife says 
it's too aggressive, so I'm the only 
one in he house who gets to drive it.I 
hop that the Quattroporte, the new 
sedan, is just as good; I'd buy one fo 
my wife in a heartbeat."

a 1998 MB SL500. The two could not be 
more different. This car has soul! It 
also drives beautifully,My wife mostly 
uses the auto mode which works great 
around town. The interior is as 
beautiful as a Ferrari and the 
performance is outstanding. It has a 
softer ride than Ferrari's 360 but has 
almost as much power and much more"
maserati,spyder,2002,MJC, 04/28/2002,There's nothing like a fast Italian!,4,"At long last I'm back in a convertible, 
and what a convertible it is. 
Everything about the look of this car 
is fabulous inside and out. But for 
those who believe that beauty is only 
skin deep, get in, hit the gas and hold 
on. This car is not only fast but it 
corners ""as if it's on rails"". Another 
nice feature is that at six foot three 
I fit comfortably in the car and also 
can get out gracefully. I was on a 
waiting list for the new SL500 but saw 
the Maserati at the car show.  With the 
luck of the Irish I was in my new 
Spyder 2 weeks later. If you enjoy the 
drive more than the destination, get 
this car it's a GREAT ride!"
maserati,spyder,2002,Raf Aviner, 07/19/2002,A wonderful convertible.,4,"Pros: This is a car that shows how 
Porsche cars should have been built 
post 993 model. Interior is gorgeous, 
and the performance is immense. The 
body styling is classic so it's looks 
won't fade. Handling is very good, and 
many thoughtful designer touches are 
added. Engineering is excellent.    
 
Cons: Why could the engineers not 
reduced the cowl shake???    
 
Overall Review: A great convertible 
that would have been perfect had 
Maserati managed to reduce cowl shake 
to the level of a Porsche Cabrio.  "

interior.  The car is fully optioned.  
The interior is the best looking 
interior of any car I have ever been 
in.  Leather is everywhere and it is of 
the highest quality.  While ferrari 
does own maserati they are very 
different cars. This car is a GT car, 
smoother ride and without the wild 
looks of a ferrari but it still gets 
tons of attention. It is in the same 
price range as the SL500 but much rarer 
and faster.  Do not get the nav system 
it is almost useless,  barely showing 
any information.  The paddle shifters 
are amazing, though the 6 speed manual 
is very smooth too."

It's great to drive a car that is unique and not typically seen on the road.  Now my Porche spends much more time in the garage. The only problem I have found is in the design of the soft top.  When the lid is up there is an over the shoulder blind spot that creates a problem. But who cares...when is the lid up anyway? Other than that, this car is well worth the price tag."

maserati,spyder,2005,mbutter104, 11/29/2009,My 2005,4,"After several months I love this car. Do not let others talk you out of this great ride. Ride is very nice, performance is better than average, get the tube exhaust. I am going to replace the audio system as this is the only thing that is NOT GOOD. "
maserati,spyder,2005,maserati owner, 02/08/2005,masearti ownership,4,"The Maserati Spyder is terrific to drive, it feels like 
it has unlimited torque.  You can floor it at any speed 
and are nailed to your seat. It is a beautiful, comfortable,
elegant car. I wish the exhaust was louder though."
maserati,spyder,2005,mbutter104, 05/24/2009,Fun to drive,4,"We just purchased a 2005 spyder with 9,500 miles. Half the price of new and all the fun. So far LOVE IT! Fun to drive and the quality is better than I had expected. As a corvette owner this is a blast to drive and very unique. The overall quality is very good. Not many around and a real head turner. The auto makes it easy to drive for those who just want to cruz."
maserati,spyder,2005,Cynthia Edelman, 05/01/2005,"""My Baby""",4,"I bought my Maserati Spyder on the Internet.  I have driven many different, high-end sports cars and my Spyder is the most fun to drive because of the Formual One transmission.  The car can be driven in automaic mode or you can shift manually with the paddles on the steering column.  The top goes up or down in about 30 seconds with the touch of a button, and it is really a head turner on the road.  I had the Tubi Eghaust put on mine and it souds awesome!  I love it!"
maserati,spyder,2005,scortgt, 08/02/2005,1 year of ownership,3,"I have owned my Maserati Spyder Cambiocorsa for a year and really enjoy it.  The engine is the highlight, 400 horsepower with a Tubi exhaust, sounds great and it is pretty fast.  I like the looks quite a bit but that is personal taste.  Interior is well done, but fit and finish is average at best.  I understand buying a car like this will have some flaws and so far the car has been in twice for issues.  I like this ride because you don't see many of them on the roads, like Mercedes SL 500's and Jaguar XK8, and Porsche 911's.  This car is understated compared to pricier exotics."
maserati,spyder,2005,Kevin Calvert, 08/10/2005,The affordable F430,4,"This car is simply amazing, amazingly fun to drive, very powerful, and very comfortable. It's the best all-around car I've ever owned."
maserati,spyder,2005,GC, 10/07/2005,It's a Blast,5,"I have been an exotic car dealer in the past and have driven a number of expensive cars.  This new <Maserati is just a super, fun car to own and drive.  It wants to be driven.  So far, its quality seems very good.  My only complaint is if you are over 6 feet tall it could be tight to get into the car, but with the top down, who cares."

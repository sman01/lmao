volvo,s60,2001,slcraft, 01/15/2012,"153,000 miles and still tight as a drum",4,"I bought this car and have owned it for a year.
It was bought used as a two owner of lease.
For the year, miles, safety features and modern amenities/luxury items if offered it was the most car for the money I could afford that was also the safest. Mine is still super tight and rattle free.
I was able to get the TPS (throttle position sensor) which is about a 1000-1500 repair done free at my dealership because it was a recalled (ww.vexedvolvo.com) and DO NOT buy a car that hasn't had it replaced, they all fail.
They warranty is 10 years and 200,000 miles for replacement.
Other than that it has been trouble free.
Make sure tranny fluid has been changed and timing belt done too!"
volvo,s60,2001,tfoster123, 05/02/2012,I love my S60,4,"I actually recieved this car at 192,000 miles, but I had been driving it as a family car from 168,000. We LOVE this car. My father and I do all the maintainence ourselves because let's just face it, Volvo's prices are nuts. At 198,884 (as of today) there are a few problems. My A/C cuts out after about 15 minutes, and I cannot turn it on if I want to get on the freeway. I also have a very rocky shifting, but have never had any real transmission issues as of now (knock on wood) and the suspension is less than desirable. However for a 18 year old? This was a great car to inherit. Other than the problems listed above, I love this car. "
volvo,s60,2001,VOLVONUTT, 03/02/2002,S60 IS THE BEST YOU CAN BUY,5,THE CAR WAS EXCELLENT WHEN I PICKED IT UP AND JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER WITH EACH MILE!
volvo,s60,2001,Stell, 01/05/2010,Volvo for Life,4,"I have owned my S60 since 2001, just hit 70k miles. It has been reliable and saved my life in a highway spinout at 70+mph. I have been lightly rear-ended twice and I felt nothing, barely any damage, this car holds up and I feel SAFE! It does well on gas mileage for long highway trips but is a total gas guzzler in the city.  It performs well in winter weather. I change the oil every 3500 miles and keep up routine maintenance. Car is really spacious and the trunk holds a lot. Overall it has been a reliable, safe, easy-to-drive car and I receive many complement on its looks."
volvo,s60,2001,82airborne, 09/27/2011,My Volvo,3,"I have to be honest I read some reviews and was quite in disbelief of the what people said. I just bought a used Volvo that has 217,854 miles on it and it runs perfect. Basically what it boils down to is that my car had 1 owner who bought the car in 2001. If you dont take care of your car it wont run 217,000 miles..period!. i want to hear stuff like the light bulbs are easy to fix but the housing is brittle so be careful. I dont want to hear ""this transmission sucks i bought the car in 2001 owned it for 4 years and never changed the oil in it and it blew up..Worst engine Ever!"" because then you sound dumb and I learn nothing....so thanks and no i dont work for volvo im in the army i work"
volvo,s60,2001,Proj, 06/23/2009,Not bad,4,"This car is ok. I'm a true Volvo fan and this is a little disappointment in the reliability department coming from my '88 760 GLE. But it's so much fun to drive and very comfortable. If you get one of these, make sure the transmission fluid is clear and red and the transmission control module has up-to-date software! If the fluid is not clear and red, only use 3309 ATF when you change it. The transmission is very sensitive in these cars so be prepared for some serious upkeep on it. I've been fortunate so far."
volvo,s60,2001,Kathy, Mtn View,at 68K need to get new car,3,"I have had the S60 for 10 years now, it has never left me stranded but I never get more than 20 MPG, even for a long trip.  Had to replace the sunroof, now it seems the radiator is leaking, the transmission seems quirky, it has trouble shifting into higher gear so that may be sign of trouble, at 68K would not expect any of those items to be an issue.  So at this point I am in process of looking for a good used car, will trade this in.  "
volvo,s60,2001,manofsteel05, 06/14/2011,I HATE this car!,2,"This car is an absolute nightmare! I've had this car for 5 months and its spent most of the time in the shop.
This car has MAJOR transmission problems.
$3200 to rebuild the transmission and its still not working properly.
The front suspension stinks, it has major design flaws and wears out prematurely.
I just replaced the right side CV joint, control arms, sway bar links and tie rod assemblies.
$1000 plus.
The cooling fan went bad (previously replaced in a recall) and blew out my heater core
$1200.
I haven't dealt with my ETM but from what I heard its only a matter of time until mine dies. $1000
Do not read any of the early posts, the most recent posts are when the problems begin."
volvo,s60,2001,Michelle, 09/17/2008,I love it!,5,"I bought my Volvo S60 new in 2001 and just turned 92,000 miles. For the most part, I have taken the car in for regular service maintenance. It has been a solid, reliable and fun to drive car. I have read some of the reviews below and I don't know why I haven't experienced any of the issues. The only thing I can say, is my car was maintained through the dealership. As the salesperson suggested, I changed the oil every 7,500 miles not the 3,500 recommended for most cars.  Volvo has truly delivered with this car! The seats are comfortable. I have sat in the drivers and front, passenger seat and have absolutely no complaints.  "
volvo,s60,2001,Matthew, 04/02/2008,Great car,4,"I purchased this T5 with 50K on it from a Volvo dealer figuring they would have auctioned it off if it was bad. This car has been a joy to drive, fast and fun, with no machanical issues.  At 113K, it still feels new. I have had a few repairs but no big deal over all. I will be looking to buy the R once I reach 200K on this one."
volvo,s60,2001,Chuck P. Sacarmento, 12/16/2008,A most unreliable great car,3,"Stay far away from this great car!  Its reliability and Volvo support stinks! This was our 2nd Volvo and our last! Suspension components that break every two years, oil leaks, constant bulb failures, gas door, trunk lock, and a failed transmission!  The transmission was a known problem early in life of car that reduced its life. Volvo created a feature that resulted in premature trans failure. This is well documented. If your trans fails out of warranty, which it will, Volvo and the dealer will say tough. "
volvo,s60,2001,David, 03/03/2010,Very Unreliable + Expensive to Maintain,1,"This is the worst car I've ever owned without question of the six total.  It has expensive issues constantly popping up and has terrible rattles.  I will never ever consider buying another Volvo.  I can't wait to get rid of it.  What a total disaster it has been.  I regret the day I bought it.  I don't normally complain about things, but they earned my scorn.  "
volvo,s60,2001,Ariel, 06/11/2008,I Love It,5,"I bought this car new in 2001 after having 3 Mercedes in a row. I love this Volvo! Zero problems in 7 years. Only have had scheduled oil changes, etc. I bought this car because I demolished my husband's Volvo Wagon on a trip, flipped and rolled it down a ravine -- and opened the door and walked away. I wanted that feeling of safety for myself and have not been disappointed."
volvo,s60,2001,Bet, 02/14/2009,Drive it 'till the wheels fall off,4,"I love my car however it has been costly to maintain.  Many problems occurred during the warranty period which thank heavens were covered. I now have 164,000 miles on it and hope for 100,000 more at minimum! It is beautiful however it is hard to see out of the back, turning radius is too big and handling is not as tight as I would like. I have also experienced interior issues including loose door panels, broken dash knobs and broken gear shift knob! All in all I would recommend Volvo to others however the overall quality of the car needs to be improved to compete with other cars in its ""class'."
volvo,s60,2001,Sonja, 11/30/2009,A good BUY,4,"Bought the S60 2.4T 1.5 years old (used) with 25,000 miles, because of it's good ratings and great price.  Comparable Audi and VW models would have cost me $10,000 more and seemed harder to get.  It's an overall excellent car.  The ride can be a little hard due to it's suspension.  This model EATS light bulbs with the dealer not being able to fix it. Overall very reliable and save vehicle!   "
volvo,s60,2001,Sara, 07/25/2005,Lots of pros and cons,3,"I bought a certified used S60 T5 from a great dealership. Unfortunately I moved and the dealerships I've dealt with in Los Angeles are pretty bad with customer service. Calabasas Volvo in particular is horrible. Anyway, I do really enjoy the car, but have been frustrated with some random problems that I think are unacceptable for a ""luxury"" car. Pros: 1) Very comfortable, wonderful seats and beautiful interior 2) adequate power and muscular feel 3) safe and stable Cons: 1) The turning radius is AWFUL. I cannot make U-turns, period. Ever. Even turning around in a parking lot is tough. 2) Visibility is really poor. 3) CD won't play burned CDs, often gets ""stuck"". 4) random electrical problems"
volvo,s60,2001,william newman, 12/10/2006,fun but slow,4,"As an accident reconstructionist, safety is #1.  Volvo has always been the leader and that's why I drive one.  Volvo's build quality is always 1 step up from most. Our 60 was used but certified with an extended warranty. The standard motor is adequate but not much acceleration. But it makes up for it in fuel economy 30mpg.  The ride is a bit stiff.  Would not recommend for long trips. Volvo replaced the transmission at 48k but it only cost of 50.00. I wouldn't buy any vehicle without an extended warranty. Volvo for at least part of my life....."
volvo,s60,2001,Sara, 01/15/2007,The Lupus Car,2,"This is the most unreliable car I have ever owned, in the few months of ownership the car has been towed 3 times. I fact it reminds me of the ford ""exploder"" I once owned. Where should I begin?  at approx. 70,000 the rotors had to be replaced, the sunroof broke, both headlights and license plate lights burned out with the plastic casings needing to be replaced, the fuel injection caused the car to stall into limp mode (the first tow), the battery cables were loose causing (the second tow) the transmission is slipping causing the car to lurch forward, and the third tow is do to another stall with unknown causes. I have owned this car 4.5 months. I will never recommend a Volvo."
volvo,s60,2001,kelleyga, 04/02/2007,Run away,3,"Very dificult car to keep running. Averaged around $250 a mo to keep running. Kept losing its memory. Brake booster went out, suspension shot, transmission problems, turbo problems, oil leaks, multiple brake problems, wiring crumbling. And no one one knows how to work on it, they just throw parts at it. Dealer always says its mass air flow sensor, how maney in one year! Lost 15k in value in 2 yrs and still falling. Finally gave up and traded it in.   "
volvo,s60,2001,turbos60, 03/07/2008,A good car to own,4,I'm 24 years old and I got the car when it first came out. I have never had problems with the car except the fuel door falling off. I have over a hundred thousand miles one the car and never had any issues. The next one I'm going to is going to be the volvo s60 R. I love the car and would not trade it in on anything.  I purchased the evolve programmer and the advanced exhaust system and it opened the car up. if you have the money def get get the evolve kit.
volvo,s60,2001,Kern Barrow, 02/12/2003,Volvo S60,4,"This is a wonderful automobile great 
styling comfortable tight 
construction.Volvo has done a very good 
job with this car. It really is fun to 
drive. It has a Swedish austerity and 
insouciance that I find quite 
reassuring."
volvo,s60,2001,Senior, 06/30/2003,Full Package,4,"I love my car so much - I never even 
considered a Volvo until I drove the 
S60 T5! It handles great, even on ice, 
and has quite a kick to it. Of course, 
there are slight problems - I've had my 
car in the shop to repair the CD player 
twice already in 6 months, a rod has 
been replaced and my alignment is off. 
Random things seem to go wrong and I 
hate the fact that there is no trunk 
release inside the car!! Still, it's a 
smooth ride and I love it despite its 
flaws!"
volvo,s60,2001,Erik , 07/07/2010,A good car with some things to know,4,"I love this car.  The suspension is not sporty and the seats are like home theater recliners, so I get a nice comfortable ride.  At 6'4"" 230 I fit easily in the front seats.  The fuel economy is also surprisingly strong, I get about 27 MPG.  So what are the drawbacks?  The electrical system hasn't cost me any large dollar figure, but I always seem to have to replace bulbs.  And when replacing a front head lamp, be careful, the housing is brittle and easily broken.  Also, adults can't fit very easily in the back seat.  I'm glad I bought it, but I will look for something with a little more engine kick and a more spacious back seat in my next ride."
volvo,s60,2001,TURNER, 05/28/2008,Worst car I have ever owned,3,"This car had more problems than I care to think about. I babied this car and still had sensors go bad, sunroof broken, transmission go bad at 80000 miles, lights burnt out and impossible to adjust. And last but not least, the car's engine was shuttering when I traded it in, my guess, bad turbo charger. The gas mileage was decent, but nothing spectacular. 19 city and 28 highway."
volvo,s60,2001,John, 12/14/2007,Former volvo lover,3,"I started with a 122s, then a 240. Loved them. Not this car. Bulbs constantly burning out from day 1. Dealer replaced rear control arms at 30K. Since then we've replaced another $2000 in suspension parts. Problems with air conditioner vents on hot days. They close, even though cold air is still present. Door lock system sometimes fails to lock the passenger door. Will never buy another Volvo. "
volvo,s60,2001,rrh, 07/27/2009,1st and last volvo,2,"Bought this s60 for looks, quality, safety record and name. Very bad decision..i have been replacing bulbs since i bought the car...any dealer service fee is outrageous..can't find anyone that wants to work on the thing...""limp home"" throttle body experience was maddening and very dangerous..fuel pump o-ring seal is a terrible design..gas fumes inside the passenger compartment..i am now having a really crazy electrical problem..drive the car, shut it off and come back a few hours later to a totally drained battery..nothing left on..no evidence of what the problem might be...just a dead battery... really can't explain why i still own this car..absolutely the least reliable car have ever owned."
volvo,s60,2001,high school speedste, 12/16/2003,high school speedster,4,"Since my dad crashed the car I was 
going to drive he went out and 
boughtme the 2.4T for safety, and I 
love it.  It is the most comfortable 
car ive ever been in and it has a 
spectacular 10 speaker sound system. 
It is kind of a soccer mom car but 
still the kind of car thats perfect to 
own and all my friends are envious."
volvo,s60,2001,salbfone, 05/04/2003,sweds build a nise knife,3,"nice car abit small in side, brakes to 
quick to grab, wish volvo had a v6, gas 
door does not lock, no trunk or gas 
release lever very annoying, radio 
reception not great, but besides these 
small but important things a very nice 
car with very good promise.  "
volvo,s60,2001,scott, 08/30/2010,Expensive junk!,3,"Do not be seduced by the wonderful design and comfort of the '01 S60- it is a complete piece of junk! Transmission has failed, the interior is falling apart, front suspension is garbage (I have spent almost $4000 in front suspension repairs alone). This car is a money pit. And I only have 82,000 miles on it! I am done with it, and can't even sell it, so there it sits in my backyard collecting spiders. Do yourself a favor, buy the BMW 5 series instead, I should have!"
volvo,s60,2001,mbecker, 04/25/2002,Highly Recommend,4,"This car has a very tight design.  Its 
like you're driving on a cloud...you 
dont feel the turns or the fast 
breaking...."
volvo,s60,2001,lisaX3, 05/07/2002,s60 3rd volvo,4,"S60 my third Volvo. Had 240, then 940. 
S60 has driving fun, but interior is 
small compared to previous Volvo. Doors 
dent at the slightest pressure. 
Previous Volvos exterior body structure 
was sturdier. Rear view visibility 
obscured by rear headrest. Have the 
auto drop for rear headrest, but that 
looks  funny. Fearful that Ford has 
diluted Volvo's character& reliability."
volvo,s60,2001,Braces, 05/27/2002,Volvo for life,5,Best mid-priced Volvo to date
volvo,s60,2001,Volvo Fan, 07/16/2002,My First Volvo,4,"I was impressed with the new styling of 
the 2001 Volvo. With our first baby on 
the way, I purchased the 2001 S-60 2.4T 
because of the safety record of the 
Volvo. 3 months later we were involved 
in an accident which literally took the 
front off of the car. Our 3 month 
old was asleep in the back seat, and 
she never even woke up!!  Since 
then, we purchased another Volvo, the 
2002 S-60, 2.4T. I can't say enough 
about this car. If you are looking for 
a safe, well performing mid-priced car, 
this is it!! I suggest the Turbo over 
the standard car."
volvo,s60,2001,IzMo, 08/19/2002,Could be a great sports car,4,"Overall I like the car but thought it 
was more sports oriented than it 
actually is - it sure looks the part. 
The drive train is fine, just that the 
suspension is weak. I love the fit and 
finish, the seats are incredible and 
the optional sound system is the best 
I ever heard."
volvo,s60,2001,s60driver, 08/30/2002,Satisfied Driver,4,"Went from a 1999 Lexus ES300 to the 
Volvo S60.  Was surprised to find that 
the ride is actually better.  Have 
been extremely impressed with the 
quality and design of the S60.  After 
nearly 15000 miles, the car drives as 
it did the day I bought it.  Would 
definately consider another."
volvo,s60,2001,Tucker, 09/22/2002,S60 in Alaska,4,"Love the car. Manual transmission gear 
box a little notchey in feel.
Gas mileage not much better than a V6 
so it might as well be a V6.
Great support from local dealer for 
maintance."
volvo,s60,2001,Genny6, 09/29/2002,New Volvo Owner for LIfe,5,"I did a lot of research, shopping and 
driving of comparable cars.  The T5 is 
a fantastic combination of safety, 
performance, comfort and luxury.  I had 
seriously considered the S70 (boxy body 
style) a couple of years ago and now 
much prefer the sleek and sporty look 
of the T5.  I have put many town and 
highway miles on the car in 11 months 
and I enjoy every day on the road.  I 
love the turbo power.  It is great fun 
passing other cars on big hills and the 
highway with power to spare!"
volvo,s60,2001,yomendos, 12/09/2002,All around good vehicle,4,"Although I have had to bring the 
vehicle into the shop for a few minor 
adjustments (covered under warranty), 
for the most part this vehicle has 
been everything that I expected of it."
volvo,s60,2001,Sasha 1, 01/08/2003,ok,4,"Nice car for normal driving.  Not 
enough power in 5 cyl.  Dealer service 
sucks in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn!  Parts 
expansive so get extanded warranty."
volvo,s60,2001,L. Gebhardt, 01/10/2003,"move over bmw, here come the swedes",4,"Fantastic Automobile for trip up to 500 
miles in distance. Arm rest could be 
positioned better, with would assit in 
longer drives. Car has been to shop for 
both rear shocks, but that is it, with 
the exception of oil changes and tire 
rotations. Dealer (Guiffre Volvo 
Springfield) is exceptional on

volvo,s60,2001,confussed veteran, 01/20/2003,Bad Bad Tires!,4,"I owned a 240 dl,850,940,andloved them 
all!I thought the s60 would be a step 
up!I love the bodystyle,heated seats,& 
gadgets.But there is a HUGE problem 
with the car,it haslow profile tires!5 
blow out/flats in 1.5years!I beleive 
this is directly related to the wheel 
base size and the tire size.In my 
total driving experience with a volvo 
I have never had a flat or blow out! I 
fear this is a serious design flaw and 
would warn anyone about purchasing the 
car with the low profile tires on it! 
They are very expensive and replacing 
the tires is making me have a bad 
taste in my mouth with a company I 
have loved for so long."
volvo,s60,2001,BuckeyeBob, 02/15/2003,Buckeye Bob's Black Beauty,4,"I had owned a BMW525 for eight years. 
My wife had a 740 wagon and V70 R. So 
I thought I mightspend my money where 
it would come back to America (Ford 
owns Volvo)Although very peppy vs. the 
BMW, the turning radius is'nt that 
tight. I'm over 6 feet tall, so I 
never have even small children in the 
back seat and expect a comfortable 
long ride. Dealer service is Poor in 
Dayton, Ohio, so even though car in 
warrantee I pay mechanic to do 
service. Volvo on demand roadside 
assistance is average at best, both 
times were a dissapointing 
experience.I love to drive this car on 
a long highway drive. The upgraded 
sound system was worth the $'s."
volvo,s60,2001,emac2002, 02/18/2003,My first Volvo,4,"My first Volvo and not my last! Some 
minor problems in first 18 months' of 
ownership--rubbing tires, squeaky 
windshield wipers, rear taillight bulbs 
that keep burning out. However, an 
overall excellent car even though 
maintenance is a bit expensive."
volvo,s60,2001,Scott A, 07/31/2003,S60 2.4T I love it!!,4,"I bought the car 2 months ago with 27K 
miles....absolutely love it...most 
comfortable seats of any car I've 
driven.  My only complaints are with 
some of the plastic dash material, 
radio control functions, and at times 
rough suspension over city streets.  
Still, I absolutely enjoy driving the 
car which is a huge step up from my 15 
yr history of driving Hondas.  Finally, 
the 2.4T provides plenty of power with 
minimal turbo lag....glad I didn't 
spend xtra for the T5."
volvo,s60,2001,Falstaff, 08/22/2003,Great cruiser,4,"I've been really pleased with my 
commute since getting my S60.  It's 
quiet, has good highway passing power 
(better than it is off the line) and is 
both fun and comfortable.  The mileage 
has been much better than expected.  
All in all, it's a great buy.  The A4 
is much more cramped in back and the 
BMW 3 is muc more narrow in front.  
It's the roomiest ride in its class."
volvo,s60,2001,Christopher Taylor, 08/24/2003,My 2nd Volvo,4,"I must say that this has been the most trouble 
free car that I have ever own. It has the best

M&L system. This the perfect car to drive from 
Ct to GA in total comfort. "
volvo,s60,2001,das2ski, 02/28/2003,Great Car,4,"I have been very happy with the 
performance and reliability of this

I always get two positive comments from 
passengers. ""These seats are amazing""

volvo,s60,2001,kris, 08/09/2003,NOT THE FAMILY CAR WE WERE LOOKING FOR!!,3,"Great car, if you don't have young 
children, in car seats!  Only one rear 
facing car seat on the market fits in 
the car, and it can't be placed in the 
center, (the safest place in the car 
for children) by the way the car seat 
costs $300.00!  If you use any other 
car seat, the passenger seat cannot be 
used.  So much for our family car.  
Doors dent and scratch very easily.  CD 
player has problems, fuel gage says it 
has gas, but car won't start?"
volvo,s60,2001,NICSTA, 09/20/2003,VOLVO FOR LIFE,5,"NO WONDER MOST PEOPLE WHO BUY A VOLVO 
END UP BUYING A FEW MORE IN THEIR 
LIFETIME. MY S60 HAS BEEN A PLEASURE TO 
DRIVE OVERALL. I'VE GONE THROUGH TWO 
WINTERS AND SEVERAL LONG TRIPS AND THE 
S60 IS AN ETREMELY NICE PLACE TO BE IN 
ON A LONG DRIVE...BEST SEATS IN THE 
WORLD!"
volvo,s60,2001,fish man, 10/12/2003,"Overall, best luxury and perf for the $",4,"I am a car guy, and I tested a lot of 
cars. Narrowed down to Lexus 300 
(balnd suspension) Infinity I35 (tons 
of power, boring looks) Mercedes C320 
(inferior car) and The BMW 330i (road 
manners are excellent, but lots of $ 
with similar options).

I chose the S60 2.4T because the 2.4 
is a slug and I did not notice the 
extra horses or torque in the T5. Lag 
is about what it should be, and torque 
curve is good. 

I bought every option imaginable 
except for the navi system, because 
it's just not worth the $$$.

Outside looks are awesome, much better 
than the others I considered.  
Definitely recommend 17 inch wheels.  
Enhances ride and looks nice."
volvo,s60,2001,alex, 03/17/2005,Don't get a Volvo!,2,"Owning this car made me realize what kind of company Volvo is. First of all all Volvo dealers are franchased independant shops, that means Volvo has NO control over them. I had bad experience with Bay Ridge Volvo - American Inc located in Brooklyn NY. My s60 was fine until 110k miles. I started having engine idling problems. This BayRidgeVolvo dealer told me, first we will change all 6 injectors $1600 then maybe catalytic $1000+ but didn't promise that this problem will go away. I went to another shop who changed PCV valve for $150. Before they tried to shut off the check engine light 4 times, charging me each time for something new. I had to fight to get my $ back, but did not get all of it."
volvo,s60,2001,mikesvolvo, 10/28/2003,Loved it... with one kid,4,"We loved the car with one kid.  This 
back seat was not made for multiple

I have poured more than $3,000 into repairs in just 10,000 miles past the 4 year/50,000 mile waranty.  The throttle modulator went out at 50,750 miles.  No help from Volvo and $500 to repair.  Then a piston went out in the transmission at 54,000 again no help from Volvo, paid $2,000.  Then at 56,000 the passenger door lock panel went out to the tune of another $400. Just recently I was getting gas and the fuel door fell off.  $125 later I was back on the road to dump this dog. The biggest problem is that these are common problems with the S60s and Volvo (Ford) is ignoring them and the owners.  "

The safety features are amazing even the sunroof is safe!  My s60 is quiet inside, except on bad roads it can get a little rough over bumps with no weight in the car.  Cornering is actually pretty good, but bumps may require a bit of correction. Its smooth for a front drive car.  My non turbo is actually really spunky.  Maint. is a little expensive, but talking to other Volvo owners, they swear by the dependability of their cars...so far so good.  I like the Volvo because not everyone has them...I'm very happy overall with my car"

My only complaint is the gouging of 
Volvo for scheduled maintenance. You 
bring you car in for each of the 
scheduled maintenace and walk out about 
200 bucks lighter each time. The 
whopper is the 30,000 mile maintenance

a Mercedes C-Class or a 3 series BMW

We had a few very minor issues after purchasing but the sales and service staff dealt with everything as if we were their only customer, perfectly. AC compressor kicking in is a little rough, gas mileage is great for the car size and weight (29-33 mpg). I traded my Mitsubishi Eclipse for this and never lost the sporty fun.  I'm at 64K now and no issues.  My 13 yr old wants it when i'm ready for my next Volvo."

It is an amazing car that my friends love to ride, drive, and be seen in.  The optional sport shift is great for passing and provides better control of the vehicle in all weather.  Interior is sporty. The optional 4 disc indash cd and Dolby surround system is amazing qualtiy, even for the most picky of ears (whether you are listening to RENT or Van Halen).  Plus, you have the ultimate car for safety with all safety standard.  The only complaint is sport tires/wheels can rub against the wheel wells if turned too hard.  Otherwise, the car is exceptional!"
volvo,s60,2001,joeyedgins, 06/01/2006,My S60,4,"This car is awesome. I bought it with 85,000 miles on it. I had to immediately take it in for it's scheduled maintenance (90,000). The dealership didn't do anything to it before selling so I had to replace the control arm bushings, tighten the sunroof cables, download the latest transmission software for the transmission, adjust the engine heat shield, etc. (1,900 dollars including the scheduled maintenace at dealership) Do not let the price scare you! It is amazing car-especially if you want to keep your wife satisfied. I can't keep her out of it. She never drives her Mercedes anymore. The car has plenty of power for not being a Turbo.

headlights/talelights burning out, gas 
cover fallin off, key stuck in

sporty handling (leans too much) and 
turbo lag with excessive torque steer. 
5spd ""adaptive"" automoatic isn't your 
average automatic. I was told that the

When your foot releases off the brake, 
it shifts back into gear, creating a

our S60 but have noticed that the 
transmission slips from time to time 
(it seems as if it shifts into neutral 
for a few seconds and there appears to 
be no pattern to this problem). We 
have been to the dealership 3 times 
for this issue but they were ""not able 
to replicate the problem."" At the 
dealership, there were 3 other 
customers with S60's and they were all 
there for transmission problems. Is 
this a common problem with the S60's?"
volvo,s60,2001,Lexis, 06/07/2004,Owner for Life,5,"My eye caught the dark ruby red color

leather seats and fell in love.  I've 
I had two of the door gaskets replaced 
as well as the accordion-like material 
used in the sun roof.  The driver seat 
had too much play and they replaced 
the struts.  The AC is ice-cold.  
Drawbacks: Scheduled maintenance is 
too expensive - $145 every 7500 
miles.  30,000 mile check-up is 
$510.00.  Care requires premium gas.  
I wish they had a Trunk Release button

And, a locking gas door. Center

heartbeat."

styling. The car drives well-
predictable, quiet, comfortable, 
excellent acceleration except from a 
dead stop. Handling favors comfort over 
sport.

The S60 is thoughtfully designed.  For 
example, the sunroof can be opened or 
closed with one touch. And there's a 
position that eliminates boominess 
common with the roof open and windows 
shut. Why don't other car makers think 
like this?

Overall, quality is excellent. Gaps 
are straight and the paint looks 6 
inches deep. And the interior is 
flawless. But there are little 
rattles.   "

still rides and feels like a new car. 
Bought for my wife due to features and

my wife has a hard time seeing out the 
back of the car.  One glaring problem: 
this vehicle eats bulbs.  I've had it 
less than one year and have gone 
through 1 headlight bulb, 2 brake 
light bulbs and about 4 or 5 turn 
signal bulbs. Thankfully, our local 
dealer has been excellent and has

volvo,s60,2001,Rubber Trouble, 12/18/2004,Rubber Trouble,3,Fun car to drive. Good handling and decent acceleration from anywhere except a stand still. Now for the horror: I have replaced 10 tires in 3 years. The car is not designed properly for the low profile tires that came with the car. I purchased a warranty on all tires from a national tire chain after the fourth $200 tire I purchased. Now I am swapping them out at $25 a pop on a regular basis. Annoying. Maintenance is expensive. Only other major problem is the discoloration of the strips that run across the roof of the car (along the top of the door). Very expensive to replace and after many letters to the company still no answer on why the body discolors on at $35k car after 3 years.
volvo,s60,2001,raj, 12/30/2004,Perfect Car,4,"I drive high mileage and just love my S60.  Power is fine in the base model for my driving.  Reliablility is the best.

Car only has 38000 miles and replaced over 6 bulbs. The dealership I go to is not so generous and charges $4.00 a bulb a bit pricy.  Had some problems with plastic runners on roof pitting and discoloring the first year but they were replaced under warranty.

volvo,s60,2001,E H White, 08/10/2005,Great Car,4,"With over 50,000 miles, the car is still tight, quiet, good looking, and trouble free.  The most comfortable front seats ever placed in a car, and oodles of power throughout the powerband.  You just have to count to two and hold on. Handling is very good, but even better with Toyo Proxes 4 tires, rather than the stock Pirelli's. The Toyo tires are much noisier, however.  I am amused by the owners (and magazine writers) who haven't read the manual. The gas cap DOES lock, There ARE separate bass and treble controls on the (great) radio, which I personally think has very intelligent and intuitive controls , and you CAN open the trunk without the key or a fob. Great car. "
volvo,s60,2001,Paul, 10/13/2005,disappointed,4,"This is a great looking car that  has a number of design flaws and reliability issues. The turning radius is way too large, the low profile tires fail at an alarming rate as do various bulbs. The warning lights for the bulb failures override all other info until fixed whereas the low gas indicator is invisible. The radio/sound controls are counter- intuitive. There are a number of rattles that I cannot find/fix. Most annoying is that the dealership, Dalzell Volvo, Dedham Mass. They either defend the design or lie about the problems. Dealer: ""Low profile tire flats, never heard of it."" Tire store: ""Low profile tires are definitely more prone to road hazard damage."""

Maybe it has a few quirks, maybe the turning radius is slim, maybe controls aren't instantly intuitive. But the S60 has a silky smoothness everywhere your hands touch. And the T5 is more than just a pretty face. There's something about a very comfortable driving position with a huge amount of power underfoot and silky smooth controls at your fingertips that make this Volvo an unforgettable experience. Granted, I've only had mine for four months and 5K mi., so my impressions might be premature. But I almost always opt for driving the T5 over my BMW X5 when I have the chance. It just feels better.

volvo,s60,2001,Dennis, 07/20/2006,Love Hate Relationship,3,"If only the car was out of the shop long enough to enjoy driving it. I have owned this car for 5 years. Very high maintenance costs and major repair bills. Volvo seems now just like daddy Ford - hide the design flaws and fix only when the lawsuits and/or government finally steps in and forces the issue. I would love this car were it not for problems with the very heart of its performance-the electronic throttle module. Almost guaranteed to break - so much so that they have now agreed to warrant the darn thing up to 200,000 miles - and they'll replace it only after making you spend thousands in diagnostics and pre-repairs. Then, they replace with the same defective designed part! Unbelievable"

Strut mounts, control arm bushings, alternator, 3 engine mounts, 2 door locks went bad. Bulbs go out at least once ever 2 weeks. Has an annoying idle issue that is recurring and is attributed to dirt on the throttle body. Strange rattles and noises. DANGEROUSLY wide turning radius.

shopped the BMW 330I, Infinity G35 and 
Mercedes C320. It became apparant after 
test drives that the Volvo T5 had the 
best combination of looks, performance 
and price. The G35 was faster, BMW 
handled better, Mercedes did not stand 
out in any way. But, the comfortable 
interior and full array of premium 
options kept me coming back to the T5. 
I still love the way this car looks and

Also frustrating, was having the car fixed and maintained.  Finally, after less than 2 years of having the car, the sway bar broke.  We turned it in, purchased a Maxima and have been happy since. Additional note - the only seat comfortable to ride in was the driver's seat.  The back was very uncomfortable. "

volvo,s60,2001,Michael, 10/20/2007,Sweet Ride,3,"I replaced a '96 maxima that I rode hard for 200k with this car. The Maxima was fast for only 190hp. I wanted something that was fast. I had been looking for an s-60. 1st gear ain't much to talk about, throw it in second and with the right RPM, you've got a rocket. The high pressure turbo is different. I squeal the tires after it is in gear and the RPM goes up. The car is one of those classic designs that won't go out of style. (They modeled the new S80 after it.) I only wish I would have sprung for the later edition R60 with 300 HP. Maintenance ain't horrible but there are weird squeaks & rattles all over the car. My car has all the options for an '01, trackball 5-speed."

between the Volvo S60 or the Audi A4, 
Driving the car really made the 
difference. And the view of the front 
end. I chose black. And it still has an 
awesome shine today even though I park it 
outdoors. Too many people are still 
expecting the interior to be similar to 
the older Volvos. And every time my 
friends get in, they're totally shocked. 
It defines clean lines and style. Now, I 
feel I have a much better car then the 
competing BMW as well. Plus, there's more 
hidden features the dealer doeasn't tell 
you about that makes the car a way better 
deal than anything else I could find 
under $50k."
volvo,s60,2001,TomPaine, 03/06/2003,S60,4,"My first Volvo.  While I enjoy the car, 
I don't see great design/engineering at 
work.  Visibility is poor. Controls for 
windows, locks and mid-seat glove 
compartment difficult to reach. Only 
one switch to lock/unlock doors is 
irritating.  If the drivers door is 
unlocked, must first lock it and push 
again to unlock passenger door. Cant 
open trunk from inside the car except 
with keychain control. Basic sound 
system is minimal. On the positive 
side, car rides very smooth but 
soundproofing could be better. I find 
the non-turbo model has plenty of 
pickup and power. The back seat is a 
joke.  Too little leg room for an 11-
year old. An adult would curse you."
volvo,s60,2001,dimitris, 05/26/2003,"Overall, a good car.",4,"Volvo has opened up to a new segment 
with this new, less boxy style.  The 
car has been both a pleasure and an 
annoyance.  Pleasure is the feeling of 
comfort, safety, gas mileage.  
Annoyance is having the car die on us 
(battery & alternator) on the day our 
first kid was born!  

Dealer service is somewhat poor 
compared to the average German Luxury 
Sedan.  Lexus is classes above in that 
area.

Volvo does make good cars, with safety 
and comfort being the key points.  
However, be prepared to sporadic 
breakdown and spotty dealership 
service.

volvo,s60,2001,Rod, 08/02/2020,"Minor repairs, but so far a great car.",4,"I bought my 2001 s60 t5 auto 2 weeks ago with 150,000kms (85,000 miles?) on it, and so far I am loving it. I also have a 2004 v50 t5, which has been pretty much trouble free for the 3 years I have owned it, apart from the Alternator dying at around 145,000km, and the stereo failing? Its comfortable and great to drive, which is the main reason I bought the S60, other than the price, $1380.
 So far I have replaced the left hand half shaft, as well as the left sway arm bearing, both of which I knew were faulty when I bought the car. Since then I have discovered the cap on the left front shock absorber needs replacing, and the starter motor has a flat spot, which occassionally requires a tap to free it up? Both of these will be repaired in the next few weeks, and it will then be a great car. It has plenty of power, is really comfortable, and great to drive, although not a sports car?  The turning circle is no where near as good as my V50, but other than that and the small repairs needed, I have no complaints with it? I would say by the overall condition of the car that it has had few owners, and has been well looked after and maintained? All in all, I am, at this stage, happy with my purchase."
volvo,s60,2002,johnc8551, 01/17/2012,Owned mine for 8 years,4,"I bought my 2002 S60 used with 21K miles on it in 2004. It now has 110,000 miles on the odo, and I've passed it along to my stepdaughter as her college car. I get it serviced regularly and it has not been overly expensive to maintain through my local Firestone service center. It's been an overall dependable car with only a few age related failures, such as alternator, water pump, strut mounts, etc. Nothing too big at all.

The one gremlin this car has, and it seems to be rather common with this series, is that it eats tail light and headlight bulbs on a regular basis. However, these are easy to replace by the owner, and I now keep spares stashed with the spare tire in the trunk."

Because of changes in my personal life I need a bigger vehicle, and unfortunately cannot afford to keep two. My little silver S60 has been the most dependable vehicle that I have ever owned. I have worked from home since I got ""her"", so have only clocked 72K miles on the odometer, but I have pushed her hard during a few long distance road trips. I like quick acceleration and sporty lane changes and she's never let me down for a second. Other than maintenance, she's only needed one repair that costs less than $100.

Maintaining the car is in fact expensive, but worth it. It's saved me from countless close calls from people, from a wide range of coming over in my lane (shoulder saved me) to 40-0 in a couple seconds (city traffic sucks). breaks are amazing and it handles great. would recommend as a safe and reliable car!"
volvo,s60,2002,gls747@aol.com, 05/16/2003,Very good in most but not areas,4,"The S60 AWD is absolutely great in some 
areas.  Interior is the most 
comfortable front cabin space I have 
ever been in.  The dash, sound system, 
general feel is outstanding.  The 
engine is very fast, smooth and quiet.  
It provides a very safe feeling in snow 
and hard rain. Relilabilty not an issue 
so far. The handling is bit of a 
disappointment.  This car makes 
pretensions of being a sports sedan, 
but is very loose and goosey over rough 
roads, wind, etc. Loud thumps from 
median stips reverberate.  That said, 
it still handles well on lane changes 
or around corners.  A set of high 
performance tires has stiffened the 
ride considerably.  "
volvo,s60,2002,dingo686, 08/25/2009,Great Car For The Money!,4,"I have put 30k miles on mine and these are my impressions so far at 80K miles. I used to be a Honda guy but when I couldn't find a used one at a descent price I drove this car and boy am I glad I did. These cars have all the reliability of the Japanese cars but better fit and finish and quality. Just open and shut the doors of this car and you'll know what I'm talking about. Only problem I've had with this car is the fuel pump cracked but it is a recall item so I took it to the dealer and they replaced it no charge. I have replaced one daytime running lamp and the oil and that's it. To me you get the looks, feel, most of the peppiness and quality of a BMW 3 series but at half the price.  "
volvo,s60,2002,Grant Shoffstall, 02/27/2018,"It's from 2002, what did you expect?",5,"So I'm writing this review from a new drivers perspective. This was my first car, and I still drive it. One thing people need to understand about this car is that it's an old luxury vehicle. Most old luxury vehicles aren't built for long term use. They're built to be driven off the lot for two years to be returned to the dealership so the owners can get a new lease. I'm so thankful Volvo doesn't fit into this category. This car is an absolute tank. You can go to hell and back with this vehicle and not only will you be safe, but your vehicle will be able to run on as well. I've been driving this think with a broken transmission for 3 years. Let me repeat that. This thing still drives with a malfunctioned transmission. This car is durable and it will stand the test of time. As long as you keep up on maintenance and aren't an idiot, this will be the most reliable vehicle you've ever owned. (P.S. to the guy who was having trouble driving in the snow; Have you heard of snow tires?)

volvo,s60,2002,Chris, 06/20/2016,Very nice car,4,"Bought a new 2002 S60 2.4T and still have it, just turning 203,000 miles. Very nice ride, good gas mileage, nice handling, turbo has been great and the car rides like the day I bought it. It's been very reliable and I want to keep it up until 250,000. The downside is minor repairs can be expensive as I'm told it takes mechanics sometime to get the part that needs fixing and mechanic hours equals dollars. The biggest downside has been the electrical system. Bulbs burn out very quickly and I had an issue with a box mounted to the frame that caused a fault with the alarm system in which the lights would flash on and off and the door locks would open and close.

volvo,s60,2002,Mr. B, 10/26/2009,Not the car for me,3,"I have had this car for 3 and a half years now and have more gripes about it as it gets older. There are bright some bright spots but it accelerates slowly (i run the car on premium and use synthetic oil btw) really gets slow after about 80, and has so-so handling. The car has left me stranded twice, things that have broken on it: the key would not remove from the ignition (dealer said they've never seen this before), it's AC turns on by itself when the car is sitting for over 40 minutes with no keys in it (dealer replaced the whole fan and it did nothing), the right side blows hot air and left side blows cold air and the dealer can't seem to fix it, the gas panel door has fallen off etc..."
volvo,s60,2002,Rachel Morris, 12/14/2016,Can't afford to keep this car,2,"Before I bought this car I was warned that Volvos were expensive to fix, but was assured by a Volvo owner I knew that his mechanic was great and not too pricey. Great! It was a good deal, $5,200 for a cute looking car with only 60-some thousand miles on it-- leather, sunroof, great looking Carfax... This was in 2014. Two and a half years later... I wish I'd gotten a Toyota or Honda. The few mechanics in my city that specialize in Volvos/European cars are always busy-- so busy they don't even pick up their phones... What does that say about Volvo reliability?? Driving it home I noticed a loud, scary rattle... the exhaust pipe was falling off! Plus the engine was gunked up. Got all that fixed... Fan motor on A/C developed an annoying chirp. $$$. Oil changes were pricey. Brakes needed replacing sooner than expected... outrageously expensive!!! Bulbs ALWAYS going out. Then it developed a gas smell so strong that I couldn't park the car in the garage because the house would smell like gas! Had it looked at by 2 diff mechanics... one couldn't figure out the problem, the other wanted $350 just to do the work to diagnose. One of the mechanics told me he thought the transmission would go out soon too! Replaced a part myself, didn't fix the gas issue... Finally said screw it, I'm getting rid of this thing. So only 30,000 miles later, I've sold it for $1,100... and I feel sorry for the person getting it.

volvo,s60,2002,golferaz, 03/08/2013,Great for all,4,"I bought an s60 in November of 2010.
It's the t5, 5 speed automatic.
I am absolutely in love with this vehicle.
I bought it with 127k miles on it in Arizona, its been driven around there and then across the country to Arizona.
Most people would be hesitant to drive a car with 140k miles on it another 2000 miles, across unfamiliar ground, but the car did great.
Great range, averaged around 29 mpg on the trip.
Great sound system, comfortable, handy on board computer system to check information.
I did put W rated tires on it about a year ago (speed tires), and I noticed that the cornering and stability increased ten fold.
A bit expensive for parts, but you pay for quality. Great for all"
volvo,s60,2002,Andrew, 04/18/2005,Ford Should butt out,4,"This car has been in the family since it was brand new. It's a pretty nice car, but it's had a lot of silly little problems. In its lifetime, the wheel bolts rusted, the front bumper popped itself out of place. Just recently, went to get gas and when the attendant opened the fuel door it fell into his hand. This, from what I have seen, is a popular issue with S60s and V70s of this generation. The glove compartment door is now sagging, and the paint quality is very poor. Mechanically, the transmission seems a little screwy, causing the car to shake when you let go of the brakes after a complete stop. This is an awesome looking car, but unfortunetly it's a bit unrefined."
volvo,s60,2002,Steven Brown, 09/16/2016,Safety at a price,3,"Car was safe and solid, but repairs were frequent and costly. It is not a bargain to own, though it gets good mileage and is cheap to insure, because it was always in the shop! From the start, there were a lot of small problems with the car, from transmission issues, stalls, and starting problems to electrical issues. It is my first and my last Volvo.

It is gone now. I had it 15 years and the engine, interior, and body were still in good shape, but after many problems with the electrical system and transmission, and engine trouble from a failed vacuum hose, when most of the suspension needed replacement, it had to go. Replaced with something other than a Volvo.

volvo,s60,2002,an9reaw, 12/14/2010,Another Great Buy...,3,"I was kind of sorry to see that so many people had S60 troubles.
I bought my pre-owned 2002 S60 in 2007 @ 90,000K knowing very well that I'd own it for years to come.
It's nearly 2011 now and I still haven't had anything unexpected.

This is my second Volvo (first being a 1996 850) and it's true they are extremely expensive to maintain, but I haven't had unexpected issues, as I've always gone to the Volvo deal for every single last part on the car/service. 

Things that needed replacement for were: 
+ Fuel Filter
+ Muffler (I live in New England, they go quickly with rust)

Other than that, the car is now at 170,000K and seems to be going well."

Good performance, turbo is a lot of fun on the highway. Gas mileage is usually aroung 25 city 30- 33 highway (Depends how you drive).  Interior is small in the back but i dont care because im the driver and it is awesome in the front.  Interior is also very nicely appointed.  Sound system rocks.

I wanted a pre-owned, luxury vehicle that was somewhat practical and that would not break the bank.  After looking at a few Jags I made a comment out loud about how surprisingly uncomfortable the Jag was to drive.  From that comment the sales associate mentioned how comfortable the Volvos were to ride in.  In a good mode and wanting to insure I considered all options I decided to allow the Volvo to be brought around for a test drive.  My first word uttered once I sat in that drivers seat was 'wow'.  Comfort is a rule when choosing Volvo.  Now I have had the car a while I must say, what a value."

With extreme heat (like in Las Vegas) expect the ""wood"" interior paneling to peel off.  Fuel cap door, like many other posts have said, will break.  Don't bother fixing it....it will break again.  Headlights, buy them in bulk because you will replace them every couple months.  Dropped a pretty penny on struts, tires and brakes, but that is my fault for buying a used car without getting it checked out by a mechanic first.  New battery, fuel pump, and fuel filter, and it still won't start until you try it a couple times.  20 mpg isn't quite what I had expected from a sedan."

It does have a major design flaw in that the front tires rub against the frame if you attempt tight turns into/out of parking spaces. I find this to be minor. Overall I am very satisfied.

volvo,s60,2002,consumer8796, 09/26/2003,By a Acura or Infinity,3,"   First of all the customer and 
dealership service for the vehicle is 
the worst I have ever had.  Horrible.  
Vehicle stalled and left my wife and I 
stranded. I was able to start it again. 
Dealer advised loaner cars were a 
curtisy but not manditory. Also advised 
they would not provide a ride home for 
me if more then 15 miles. Honda here I 
come!  Dealer advised car was fine!"
volvo,s60,2002,BarbB, 04/29/2009,Awful in Snow,3,"I like the look and the comfort of the Volvo - love the leather heated seats - but it handles terribly in snow. I am petrified to drive it in winter - have slid through intersections, need to crawl on the highway, etc. I bought the AWD thinking it would be good in poor road conditions but quite the opposite is true. I needed a car quickly to replace my beloved Nissan Sentra that was totaled in a hail storm. I jumped on the used Volvo based mostly on a friend's recommendation. Now I can't wait to get rid of it.  Also, the AM radio never worked properly. And repairs cost an arm and a leg. Never again, Volvo."

volvo,s60,2002,steve, 06/30/2008,S60 High maintenance,3,"Did you know the Volvo dealership considers your 100K mile S60 high mileage? Once this car hits 100K, it falls apart. Transmissions will fail no matter how well you maintain it. $4500. Road noise even with high dollar tires. You can forget trying to do any of your own maintenanve. $1700 for brake pads and rortor? Good gosh. Did not realize a 5 cyl turbo could be such an underperformer either. No more Volvos for me.  "

Told it was ""sludge"" plugging the turbo, (despite our regular oil and filter changes.) Every minor thing cost an arm and a leg to fix. Blinker kept going out (short somewhere in system - ate bulbs like candy). Very expensive cost of ownership.  The transmission was threatening to go, but the engine went first.   "
volvo,s60,2002,Liked My Lexus More, 07/11/2002,Get a Lexus!,3,"Car has constant clanking.  Vision is 
impaired when turning or driving a 
curve.  whiplash protection seats move 
back  of their own accord during normal 
driving.

Car takes even small bumps really 
hard.  Seat bottoms tend to force legs 
together (uncomfortable for female 
drivers).  Hand brake makes it hard to 
get to anything (like a purse) on floor 
of passenger seat.

Trunk almost impossible to open with 
the remote and once open is so stiff 
it's hard to close.

Gas mileage indicator nice idea, but 
not at all accurate."

finally settled on deciding between 
the BMW 325 and Volvo S60 2.4T. I 
really think you get more for your 
money with the Volvo. It's a great car. 
I've had mine for 2 months and have 
been very happy with it - except for 
one problem. I'll be selling the car 
soon because of this - but I was just 
unlucky with the dealer and Volvo 
Customer Service. My bad 
experience is probably a fluke, so I'd 
recommend the car. I'd just take the 
""We Care"" slogan as advertising and 
not something to be relied upon."
volvo,s60,2002,Jaxster, 02/17/2004,I just don't get it,3,"Doesn't handle as well as a BMW, isn't 
as comfortable or user-friendly as a 
Lexus, costs more than either.  View is 
limited, gas mileage is atrocious, 
turbo has significant lag time.  On the 
plus side, front seats are extremely 
comfortable and car handles quite 
nicely if not spectacularly.  On the 
whole though, I can't wait until my 
lease is up."
volvo,s60,2002,Nat, 05/14/2016,First and last Volvo,3,"I had a Volvo S 60 AWD turbo from 2002 - 2006. The car had many unscheduled repair visits. I picked up the car on a Friday and I was already in need of repairs on Monday- rear windows did not work. The problems I had were mostly electrical.

I found the front seats not particularly comfortable for the long haul and the back seats are not suitable for adults except in a pinch. 

Gas mileage was ok,mower was good, ride was good and the cabin was quite. Occasionally heard the turbo whine. Odd issue with the radio- I wear polarized sunglasses, and that washed out the radio display. I never had that problem before or since. 

AWD system was very effective.
"
volvo,s60,2002,Kerrigan, 04/05/2002,Great car,4,"I had been looking at cars for about 6 
months. I really liked the new body 
style of the Volvos. I owned an Audi A-
4 and I was waiting for the lease to 
expire.  Well, I finally bought a car 
(a new Infiniti I-30).  After owning 
the car for a few months, I felt like 
it was too big/touring sedan for me. 
So, I looked at the BMW 325 and MB C240 
and decided upon the Volvo S-60. It was 
the right size and equally priced to 
the BMW and MB (was a little higher)."
volvo,s60,2002,Lance, 04/13/2002,Manual is much better !,4,"This is my second Volvo - as well as my 
second with the manual transmission. 
The changes that Volvo has made to the 
transmission are amazing.  I knew that 
going with the non-turbo engine would 
sacrifice some performance but the 
return in fuel economy and the fun-to-
drive factor of the manual definitely 
outweighs the slight lack of power.

I have gone on many long trips with my 
Volvo's and the comfort level of the 
seats and interior is unmatched by any 
other vehicle I have driven in this 
price range. Volvo has another happy 
customer ""For Life"""
volvo,s60,2002,Michael, 07/22/2008,My favorite car ever,4,"I do love my Volvo. It is so incredibly comfortable. The seat fits me perfectly and for once I don't have to tilt my head back to find the headrest. The premium sound system is outstanding. My only concerns about the car are the fact that I have probably changed lightbulbs (mainly in the rear) about 10 times in 2 years. I am not too pleased with the gas mileage as I seem to average 22 per gallon. The car drives great, is very quiet, and is styled beautifully."
volvo,s60,2002,rrgennaw, 04/15/2002,2.4T -Nice blend of Performance & Luxury,5,"I've driven the S60 2.4T for almost 6

with buying a VOLVO.  

Not a box anymore."
volvo,s60,2002,Xaviergod, 04/21/2002,Just got Yesterday... There are no words,5,"I picked up the car yesterday and it 
figures on my way home a big storm was 
comin so I put it in my garage in case 
it hailed (which it did) After the 
storm I took it out for a spin.  Since 
the roads were wet I ended up paying 
more attention to the stereo than the 
car performance.  I have the upgraded 
sound system with 13 speakers.  I would 
highly recommend them.  Stick in a 
Michael Jackson CD to get the full 
effect.  The car handles suprisingly 
well on the wet roads and even better 
on dry which I experienced today.  
Anyone who says this car can't corner 
doesn't know what they are talking 
about.  With the sport bucket seats 
cornering becomes fun and comfortable."
volvo,s60,2002,ikey, 09/14/2008,I'm never buying a different car!,4,"The S60 has been a pleasure to drive. 247HP out of a turbo 2.3L I-5 is quite impressive and it is very reasonable with fuel. My mixed average is 25MPG, which is comparable to that of smaller cars. A lot of attention has been given to details and the build quality; it feels solid and is a quiet ride. The outside design is tasteful and simple and the interior is nicely laid out and ergonomic."
volvo,s60,2002,joepags, 05/15/2002,2001 S60 T5,4,"This is my 1st Volvo.  Went into the 
decision wanting German, but the value 
of the S60 in my mind was far greater 
than the BMW 5 series.  Hated the 
IS300, liked the TL Type S but couldn't 
see paying $30+ for Japanese, and 
couldn't afford an A6 2.7T.  The A6 was 
far and away my favorite, but $45K is a 
downpayment on a house, not a car!"

volvo,s60,2002,omid, 02/02/2009,Beauty lasts so long,3,"The car rides comfortably. The seat grabs your body and makes for great long trips. The exterior is well designed. The trunk is full of space and I've moved several times with the car. Rear passengers are really comfortable. The two plugs are great. Other than that the car is a pain. Things that shouldn't ever go bad, go bad on the model. I've changed the brake booster and front suspension and O2 sensor. It would have been nice if the O2 sensor had lasted a bit long. The repairs are really pricey too. The stock stereo is plagued, either the speakers blow easily or the stereo gets tired of your music. My heart wants a new Volvo but my mind knows a reliable cheaper to fix car might be better. "

The car is reliable, fast, and gets good gas mileage.  The reliability, the big stuff is great, but I agree with others, my fuel door fell off, and I seem to replace a lot of brake lights.  Other than that it has been very good.  The engine uses no oil (I design engines for a living , I would know), it maintains very clean oil through the oil life, indications the rings and guides are in good shape still.  The paint is amazing, I don't wax it because it seems to not need it, looks new still (not garaged for most of its life)."
volvo,s60,2002,Sid B, 06/07/2002,VOlvo S 60 T5,4,"A beautiful (inside and out), 
ergonomic, fun vehicle to own and

irreplaceable, I would not have her in 
anything but a Volvo.  No issues since 
day of delivery, except for a defect 
in the wall on one of the Pirelli 
P6's.  Having problem finding a 
replacement tire in So. CA, local

cars before we came to the Volvo s60 
2.4t. I wish we had gone to Volvo first.
The ride is fantastic and the fit, 
finish and features are head and 
shoulders above the compitetion.
We drove the BMW 325i, Acua TL, 
Mercedes C240, and Infinity I35. 
The BMW and Mercedes have 168hp the Tl 
225 and the I35 255. Not one of these 
cars has the excelleration of the 197hp 
s60 turbo I5 motor. Both of the 
Japanese cars drive like american cars, 
soft ride, weak handling. The Volvo 
hangs in with both the mercedes and the 
BMW in terms of confidence and 
response. "
volvo,s60,2002,CanadaEh!, 06/11/2002,Not quite a BMW yet...fun anyway,4,"Tromp on the gas peddle and you'll fly 
by many cars.  The turbo lag is 
annoying, as it the slow 
shifting ""tiptronic"", but on a straight 
line, once the turbo kicks in, look 
out. My only 
issue is with handling around corning - 
too much power and chassis needs to be 
tuned to handle the power of the car.  
Excellent design, not a fancy electonic 
stability system, should be the force 
behind handling.  The interior is, 
quite frankly, flawless.  The most 
comfortable and well designed car on 
the market."
volvo,s60,2002,GP, 10/03/2009,Very Good Vehicle,4,"I've had the car about 8 months. So far very reliable. It wants to run. Very, very comfortable car with great front seats. Stereo is excellent, climate controls intuitive. I've always had 5-speeds in sedans, but this automatic has me converted with its performance. The 5-cylinder is a good compromise of performance and economy. I'm getting 28 mpg [25 mile commute, cruising at 70 mph] with ample reserve power when needed."
volvo,s60,2002,Debra, 06/16/2002,"Excellent Car, Excellent Value",5,"I am leasing a Volvo S60 and absolutely 
love it! The car is sturdy, gets great 
gas mileage, is extremely comfortable 
especially for long trips, has a great 
stereo, and has so many great standard 
features. When I was researching cars 
this summer, I compared the Volvo S60 
to many other vehicles in its class. 
Volvo gives you more for your money -
you can get a fully loaded vehicle for 
a few thousand less than its 
competitors. Also, its nice that the 
new Volvos are ""rounded out"" -older 
models were so square. The main reason 
I have a Volvo is because of the 
standard safety features. The car is 
built nicely and handles really well."

half ago.  Since that time, it has been 
in the shop on no less than 5 occasions 
for major electrical/computer 
malfunctions:  total shutdown of all 
electronic read-out; power window,locks 
and sunroof not working; and brake 
lights that stay on despite the fact 
that the car is turned off.  I thought 
I was upgrading from my Honda Civic

safe vehicle for my family as well as 
one that stands out from the rest of 
the bunch.  We have loged over 4500 
trouble free miles averaging 29 plus 
mpg on the freeway at 75 mph.  The 
paint quality is near perfect as well 
as fit and finish.  I wish I had seats 
in my home as comfortable as the ones 
in the front of this car.  Our 2 and 4 
year old kids fit comfortably in their 
car seats in the rear with enough leg 
room so their feet are not in our 
backs.  The 2.4 T has plenty of power 
through most of the power band.  The 
front of the car feels a little heavy 
when pushed hard into a corner but 
otherwise handles well."

handles curves very well at good speed 
and the braking capacity is 
outstanding. It is very comfortable 
with probably the best leather seats 
in this class. Trunk room is 
surprising since it is square without 
tapering to more narrow dimensions. 
Fuel capacity is remarkable since the 
tank holds 21 gallons.  At 9 mos, 
reliability is excellent. Only 
problem I've experienced is a back

tilt. The telescopic wheel is a great 
feature although a little more range of 
movement would help. The engine and 
airconditiong are a nightmare. It 
sounds like someone is gargling water 
when you accelerate. There is also a 
popping noise when the car shifts. The 
lousy dealers (and i do mean lousy) say 
it is normal despite the fact that the 
loaner car i had had none of those 
problems. The dealers are terrible. I 
live in south Florida and had to buy my

handled OK but I still found it lacking 
as far as handling is conserned. 
Something appears to be missing - just 
cannot match the feel of the BMW. no it 
is not the front wheel drive! I like 
front drivers, but S60 comes up short. 
To bad, it is otherwise a really nice

volvo,s60,2002,pjw, 02/28/2005,Could be better,3,"I bought Volvo primarily for the safety features.  However, I've had several disappointing occurrences with performance.  The transmission slips from time to time.  The door locks are constantly out of sync.  I made 4 trips to the dealer for warning lights about the engine without resolution until a recall solved the problem.  I expected a more luxurious interior/panel for the price.  The buttons, knobs on the panel look cheap - my compromise for safety.  I'm in the market for a new car and won't be a repeat Volvo customer."

10000 on it I've put 8000 miles on it 
so far, and it has been perfect.
I lowered it and it transformed the car 
into a handling fool. The ride is as 
good or better than before and it 
handles like a slot car. Comfortable, 
roomy in front. No complaints 
whatsoever. Could have a better 
(standard) stereo and speakers. I wish 
it had the optional Volvo radio as that 
is a wonderful piece

volvo,s60,2002,beli, 01/26/2004,Needs work but NICE,4,"Nice car in many ways but needs a few
thigns to make perfect:
1) Has BIG blind spots b/c of saftey
features and design.. adjusting seats
may help or narrowing support beams.
2) Electronics have always been Volvos
weakness.. they should outsource all to
Japan ASAP!
3) My S60 needs turbo.. my fault.
4) Maybe a rear wiper.. rear window is
almost flat and gets covered easily."

The transmission slips, hard start in 
the morning, and hard to keep it 
running when cold, stalls out 
repeatedly .  Ignition Cylinder just 
had to be replaced.  Electrical system 
also.  Cannot understand what happened 
to Volvo quality.  I have 3 Volvo's. 
All 2002 model years, S40, S60,and a  
S80.  No problems except with the S60.  
I am planning to get rid of this one 
very, very soon.  "
volvo,s60,2002,Butterfly2, 04/29/2004,Not worth it,3,"Volvo has a complete lack of customer

to see in order to change lanes.  Back 
seat has NO leg room."
volvo,s60,2002,Savvy Driver, 05/17/2004,Beware of Customer Service,4,"We bought this car new coz we loved 
the look and reputation of Volvo.  
However, we've had major customer 
service problems as well as electrical 
problems.  Also, it is very difficult 
to see to change lanes due to the head 
rests in the back and the way the car 
frame is built."
volvo,s60,2002,Jakebird, 06/10/2004,A Smart Person's Car,4,"Though I haven't racked up a lot of 
miles, this is a reliable, sporty, 
true luxury sedan without the Lexus or 
BMW sticker shock.  It could use a 
little tweaking of the interior (wood 
trim, for example), to put it into the 
true ""luxury"" class, but it is safe, 
fast, and a very reliable player for 
the money in the competitive mid-range 
luxury class.  I do wish the mileage 
was a little better in the city, but 
my car  it actually exceeds the EPA 
estimates on the highway.  Finally, my 
last Volvo was traded running strong 
with 183K miles and expect the same 
here."
volvo,s60,2002,ratcher, 06/29/2004,Don't think I'd buy another one.,3,"This car is fine for someone who rarely 
transports more than one passenger 
unless the backseat is for kids. It 
drives well on all kinds of roads. The 
interior layout is okay; the stereo 
system is confusing and a pain to use. 
They needed to add a changer for the 
component as well as station/track on 
the steering wheel. The airconditioning 
system is also confusing. Blind spots 
make backing out an adventure, though 
the flip down rear head rests are 
helpful. The battery is nearly 
inaccessible in the trunk (you must 
hold the trunk floor up with your head 
to access it), though a jump point is 
located underneath the hood. Pricey for 
the quality of the car."
volvo,s60,2002,Michael Lopes, 07/14/2004,IS IT WORTH IT,4,"I do have to say this car is very 
stylish and fun to drive.  But, I have 
had many things go wrong with this car 
at only 55000 miles.  The front wheel 
bearing needs replaced at a wopping 
$1200 and both rear and left front Link 
Rods need replaced at $400.  As you can 
imagine I am not to happy with this as 
it is no longer under warrenty.  
According to Volvo Service, this does 
not happen often. When you spend this 
kind of money for a car this is one 
thing you do not expect.  Therefore I 
do not give this car a thumbs up. I am 
just afraid this is a sign of what is 
to come as the miles continue to grow."

volvo,s60,2002,Junec, 11/16/2004,"Great look, great safety",5,"The Volvo S60 is the most favorite sports sedan I have ever owned. It has been problem free, is fun to drive, has great styling, and is very comfortable. The engine is powerful which in an urban area is important and the safety features like SIPS, side air bags, and seatbelts that will lock you in instaneously in an accident are second to none."
volvo,s60,2002,Volvo For Life, 12/23/2004,T5 - What A Drive!,4,"Following a thorough research process including safety, gas mileage, and long term cost of ownership (as compared with the BMW 325, Audi A4, VW Jetta, and Lexus IS300), the Volvo S60 T5 was an obvious choice. At 37K miles it is still every bit a great drive. Exterior styling has details like no chrome or visible radio antenna making for a truly classy profile from any view. The interior follows with plenty of leather, logical controls, two stage heated seats, and plenty of little stowage areas. The engine backs this up with linear and drama-free throttle response. The S60 R is quite a deal as well, but if you want a great substitute for substantially less money, the T5 is not lacking much."
volvo,s60,2002,CEM, 05/08/2005,Gremlins?,3,"First 2 yrs of ownership was plagued with several gremlin issues. Electronics primarily due to faulty computer chips, which had the car not been under warranty, I would have been very upset about cost. Bulbs also, burn out very quickly. Was advised by service Volvo uses a GM bulb. Seems a bit silly, especially in modles with daytime running lights. Now, at 3 yrs the car has been trouble free (fingers crossed). Good dealership, ready to work with you on issues and after friendly persuasion, have extended no charge on little fixes."
volvo,s60,2002,UofA Grad, 02/05/2007,"Nice; car, ride, feel, some minor repair",4,"This car is nice.  Had a few immediate problem after initial purchase.  The drivers side door (inside handle) went out of commission.  Since the car was certified the warranty cover it.  The check engine light came on after 60,000 miles, that cost $200 to fix.  The stock radio does not work well with cell phones in the car.  Overall not bad, its a fun sedan to drive."
volvo,s60,2002,so cal owner, 03/05/2002,A great car,5,"I've driven the S60 for four months now and my overall satisfaction is a 10.  It's a great car and stands out on the Southern California roads filled with MBZs and BMWs. 

After happily owning a Mercedes for over 15 years, I'm glad that I decided to consider alternatives. I looked at Audi, Jaguar, Acura, MBZ, BMW and Volvo.

It's fun to drive a car that you don't see everywhere you turn.  Especially one that performs and looks as good as the S60."
volvo,s60,2002,jmalexander, 03/05/2002,S60 is awesome,5,Great vehicle; extremely comfortable and very reliable. Interior has everything needed except a back seat...very small. Firm ride and excellent road feel.
volvo,s60,2002,Chris, 05/04/2007,Fuel efficiency and good quality.,4,"I highly recommend the Volvo S60.  It's an affordable, reliable and fuel-efficient car that looks and handles like a much more expensive vehicle.  The 5 cylinder NA engine won't set any records at the racetrack but it will still get you where you want to go.  The quality of manufacture is excellent, nothing feels or looks cheap, except the faux wood paneling in the interior.  The key access port for unlocking the truck is badly placed and difficult to get to, but you'll probably use the remote entry anyway.  The anti-theft alarm is hit or miss.  It tends to go off at the strangest times, even if the car is unlocked.  The fuel economy is excellent, I average 28 mpg highway."
volvo,s60,2002,Pau, 05/10/2007,2002 S60 T5,5,"Great all-round performer.  Have owned since new.  Only to shop for basic maintenance except for recent A/C issue.  Have owned Mercedes E Class and 5 series BMW that spent much more time for repairs.  Go for the T5 or R model, just watch the torque steer.  I never thought a Volvo could perform this well.  At nearly 60000 miles it still runs strong as new."
volvo,s60,2002,Sunny Blue Skies , 07/30/2007,A Nice Upscale Vehicle,4,"I bought my 2002 S60 in 2004.  The car already had 75,000 miles on it from being a corporate lease vehicle.  I was a bit leery at first to pay a higher price for such high miles.  So far, I have had the small things wrong.  Repair is fairly comparable if you get it done at a non-dealer repair shop.  Sad to say the repair shop I took mine to for most of my ownership, ruined my oil drain plug opening, and now I am faced with an $800 repair for a new pan as the hole can not be repaired.  Also the fuel door hinge broke and now I have to place the door on the trunk at fill up, but that part is only 10 bucks and I will repair myself.  Overall its an ok car, hopefully Volvo has improved any issues."

the factory in Sweden. Very good 
overseas delivery program, which the VW

about 7k miles; drivable, just lit up 
faulty warning lights. Fixed under 
warranty. Currently over 17k miles, no 
other troubles, except I can't reset 
the ""regular service"" reminder, as I 
change the oil etc myself. Have the 
optional cupholder with no trouble. AWD 
is very sure footed in snow/ice. Love 
the interior, except the parking brake 
should be moved over a bit for more leg 
room. Giant trunk and decent gas tank 
size(check out a BMW, for much more 
money, on these details!) Hope to get 
an R as our second one."

The seats in this car are the most comfortable I have ever ridden in.  On long trips, you don't even realize you are sitting in a car.

The car has more features than many others in the same category but, at a greater value.  

Overall, this is a great car which is safe, reliable, and value packed."

After buying it I expected EVERYTHING to be perfect.  It was after all a $30,000+ automobile and a Volvo.  I soon found out there there were several little things to get use to.  One was the edvanced A/C controls.  They are really out there and ahead of the times.  Well after almost four months, I continue to love my car more and more."

This is a wonderful,well-balanced vehicle.  Comfort, quality, convenience, styling- has it all.  Handling is good(not a 10/10th's car, more of a 9/10th's) and rewards subtle input with responsiveness and precision.  The cabin is a comfy cocoon that imparts a feeling of stability and security that has to be felt to be appreciated.

volvo,s60,2002,har, 03/30/2002,Excellent Car,5,"While this car may not have a true sports car feel like a BMW, Lexus, Acura, etc...., it is a solidly built, head turning car in a class by itself. It is very confortable to drive. The seats are second to none. Interior is well layout and trimmed. The 2.4t which I drive comes with a long list of amenities.

We did experience many problems that were annoying, but the overall experience overshadows the design and quality shortfalls. I am considering a newer (2007) S60 AWD purchase and will likely keep this one for my daughter to use. Front wheel drive was just adequate in snow. Next time I'd buy AWD. Transmission shift problem required three dealer visits to fix during early warranty period. Fuel filler door broke off. Headlamps and tail light bulbs constantly burn out.  "

It currently has gone through three batteries(live in midwest with plenty of snow), one transmission and no other issues. (these aren't true issues just general maintenance stuff when its driven by two teenagers and myself. It has plenty of power to push through the Colorado snow and has wonderful handling. Great interior design for 2002 and it has plenty of tech that rivals with simple 2017 cars like the Ford focus. Sweden did well with this car.

volvo,s60,2002,Brian Yarbs, 10/05/2019,Solid car. One of those cars that just keeps going,5,"This car is very solid and made me a Volvo believer from day one. Sadly I just traded her in for a domestic car. She only had 180k miles. I bought her used from a shady buy here, pay here dealer, a 14 year old car with 130k, but she got me to work everyday in the New England weather. She is to the point where things are breaking severely, but she just keeps chugging along. 

And I'm not joking. Brought to a mechanic to change my spark plugs once, and after he fixed it he refused to test drive it because how bad things were. He didn't want to ""break it."" 

Original timing belt barely holding on, Oil leaked everyday for last 2 years, clouds of smoke coming out exhaust going up hills, Brake lines rusting out, Weird jerk around 3rd gear that seemed to fix itself eventually over time. Not too sure if the airbags ever worked, Dashboard would just disappear for days at a time.. No gas, speed, or any gauges for days. Then BOOM one day when it would rain, you would have dashboard. But then off again next day.

But even with all that it starts and runs fine. Still a comfortable drive.

PROS-

Very comfortable seats and ride.

Steel and body is amazing. Car is almost 18 years old, driven in harsh salted road winters and no body rust. (Original brake line just rusted out yesterday after 18 years.)

I swear this 5cyl volvo engine would outlast everything in this car. Everything else eventually stops working around it.

She loves cold weather and classical music..

I will miss her.

volvo,s60,2003,Herb M, 11/17/2015,A wolf in sheep's clothing,4,"I bought mine used with 155K. Solid traction and road handling. Great in the snow. Peppy and powerful. Love the body style. Best looking sedan on the road! Fun to drive.
It's a sensible 4dr. sedan... that can do 0-60 in under 7 seconds and can cruise down the autobahn at over 150 mph!
After fixing some common S60 problems (ie; creaking/clunking front strut mounts and sway bar end links) the car drives like new again. I have done some minor upgrades like poly bushings, engine mounts, and chassis braces which have noticeably improved the soft/squishy  handling.
I like the stereo, the triptonic shifting, comfortable (front) seats, and power most of all.

Heated seats are the bomb, Acceleration is surprisingly powerful, mileage is average or a hair less than I would have expected (26 mpg).  Yes, it's noisy. If that bugs you, it'll be too much for you. If not, the car is awesome. And if you have kids, you'll feel very responsible while still having a sporty, fun, and good looking car."

I would suggest the power seat package.  The interior can look kind of drab, I have the extra wood kit and it makes a 100% difference in the look of the dash and interior  I typically only keep a car 3 to 4 years I have had this one going on 6 years and still enjoy driving it.  The car is great in bad weather,  you hit the W mode and the car grips the road in heavy rain.  The rear fog light gets people to back off tailgating in the heavy fog.  On the freeway for road trips I get about 30 MPG, in town I average about 19 MPG.  The 60/40 split folding back seat is nice to have."

Gets 33 MPG on the highway at 75 mph. Still looks like new, leather looks perfect, everything works. Why they do not hold their value, no idea. Easily will get 250K miles and still be beautiful doing it.  Highly recommend as a used gem of a car. Why buy a used camry or accord for more money, when you can get a loaded Volvo that gets better mpgs!"

It's getting worse, all fluids, etc have been checked, I have taken excellent care of this car, maint. etc. I heard a strange clanking noise, come to find out, I needed a drive shaft, which was $1400.00 to repair. I have to sell this thing to keep from having to spend thousands on a new transmission. I noticed that it's using more gas as time goes on. Never again. I get sick to stomach.

The design inside and out is fantastic and timeless. Interior quality and ease of controls are excellent, but lacks storage space. Comfort is great, but legroom is tight in back. Visibility is horrendous, as is low speed maneuvering. The car is fun to drive when its pushed hard. Reliability is unacceptable. I've replaced the starter motor, sensors, seat memory, and a bunch of other computer related things I don't know how to explain.  The transmission is dying. The auto wipers have a mind of its own, as do the interior lights and the fuel gauge. The car makes lots of weird noises. "

have owned mercedes,porches,and bmws.  
Volvos by far have always been more 
economical in my eyes. They do not have 
the power but they offer the 
protection.  HOWEVER, I do not 
recommend using the s60 in the snow.  
My daughter got stuck 3 times in the 
past 3 snow storms that Connecticut 
had.  The car gets no traction, slides 
from side to side is not a safe snow

I made a huge mistake by not buying the

volvo,s60,2003,Harry Hausen, 03/02/2003,Unbelievably Priced for what you get.,5,"First let me say that if you buy an S60 
definatly get the T5.  The 17"" Tethys 
wheels add so much to the cars 
styling.  The T5's performance is also 
remarkable.  The bottom line is that 
this car looks, feels, and performs 
like a car that should cost 
considerably more.  I think this is one 
of the best values out there."
volvo,s60,2003,AVOID VOLVO, 07/01/2003,Car to Avoid,3,"In 11 months of ownership the cruise 
control failed, transmission doesn't 
shift right, all bulbs on the rear of 
the car have burned out at least once 
each, and the throttle control system 
required replacement.  The 
transmission problem required 6 
different visits to the dealer, and 
still has not been corrected.  The 
interior has 2 ongoing squeaks and 
rattles that after 3 attempts, the 
dealer can not seem to repair.  
Overall, the quality of the car is 
extremely poor, performance is very 
average.  The only attribute this car 
has is comfortable front seats.  "
volvo,s60,2003,Incubus, 05/02/2006,You may have big trouble with S60,2,"Well, Ford-owned Volvo needs to improve a lot. After riding a year, the engine of S60 stops sometimes during maneuver and the big problem cannot be fixed yet.  The suspension is now too soft to give firm ride comfort and the interior makes a rather noisy sound."
volvo,s60,2003,NH WInter, 01/02/2009,Buyer Beware,3,"When I purchased my S60 AWD I thought it was going to be a great vehicle. I was wrong. Looks great, but many, many nickel & dime mechanical problems, which are both time consuming and expensive if you take it to the dealer each time. Traded an Acura CL for the Volvo, never again"

THIS CAR SAVED MY LIFE!! I bought it with 125,000 on it never had major engine problems or transmission, except for a little slip every now and then. It was exspensive to fix but it was so worth the performance, handing, smooth ride, and most of all the safety. Everything about this car was great. I would recommend this for anyone, especially for a teenager or new driver. I wrecked this car and flipped it 4 times and then slammed into a tree on the driver side. I walked away with a seatbelt mark on my kneck and didn't even need to go to the hospital. After this wreck my car was fully intact with all trim, headlights and tailights, and the front and rear bumper. The only damaged was all the windows were busted and the top was dented as well as the doors.. The frame of this vechile saved my life. The frame stayed fully in place without any damaged at all. AMAZING. They engineered this car perfectly and I would sell my BMW (which I bought this Volvo after I had my BMW and currently still driving the Beamer) and buy another Volvo if I didn't love it so much. 100% recommend a Volvo if your looking to buy one!!!

volvo,s60,2003,Scot , 09/02/2010,Are you kidding me?,3,"We bought this car in 2003. It was a safe sporty family car. Shortly there after the problems began. First electrical and module problems, which cost us $2,000. Then transmission problems, followed by sounds from the brakes, and some other misc. things I didn't understand, repairs quoted at $8,000. That's 3 years and $10,000 in repairs. Topped off with an electrical system failure, that required it to be towed to the shop. I am now waiting for for my latest quote, which I imagine won't be cheap, because the only thing cheap on this car is the quality. If you read any good reviews on this car they were written by a dealership. Run away as fast as you can!"
volvo,s60,2003,Popps, 06/11/2008,Great used value. Safe and sporty,4,"I love my S60, even with its flaws. In my opinion, the best looking body of any sports sedan. Great reliability history, especially for a Volvo. Let's hope they continue this trend. Ride is good. Peppy, but I'd prefer a bit more power. (I have 2.4T) Interior design is fine, but could be a bit more refined for a luxury sedan. (See Infiniti) Gas mileage is surprisingly good. An excellent used value, as Volvo's don't hold value like a BMW/Mercedes. Again, it's not perfect, but I love mine and doubt you'll do any better for the money in the used market. "

excellent comments.  The first thing

Accord over this car?""  Crazy! This 
car feels more powerful and spacious

Now our 2003, brand new volvo S60 T5

found in it would cause us not to get 
the car again. I would have probably 
preferred a 3 series, but ruled it out 
because of rear-wheel drive and that 
arrogant stereo-type of BMW drivers. 
There are some things that I would have 
expected to be a little better in a car 
of this price (stickered at $36,000). 
The engine is kind of noisey. In my 
opinion, it should be whisper quiet. 
Also, when the AC compressor kicks on, 
you know it. I wish the car had 
more ""nooks and crannies"" to put stuff 
in. Storage space in the cabin is at a 
premium. "

AWD worked great in snow/ice.  However, be warned that if you get a flat tire and there is slight wear on the tires, you must purchase 4 new tires.  This increases the cost of ownership in my opinion."

volvo,s60,2003,Andres, 12/11/2016,Great Reliable car but transmission sucks,4,"I bought this car from a previous owner in 2008 (Volvo S60 2003 T5 FWD), I've had it since 2016 so far and now will be going into 2017. Transmission problems are several in this car sadly as I was hoping it would last until 300,000 miles (Only at 180000 miles) although maybe frequent transmission fluid changes may have allowed the car to last longer as my fluid is now black and burnt smelling(Volvo's ""Life Time Fluid"" don't believe it"" ) I've wanted to change the fluid for the tranny a few years ago but my dad insisted not to because volvo said so as I wasn't very knowledgeable about cars at the time I was array of doing anything I've should have done it anyway. Will be driving it until the transmission goes out (maybe next year or 2 years from now but who knows, Park to Drive Delay, Slipping, Clunking, Hard Downshifts, sometimes bangs when turning etc... works fine when cold but problems occur when hot so tranny may just be overheating, cold works like when I first bought it)              Now for the good about the car, the car is a-bit slow to accelerate from a stop but it does go fast about 0-100 within 6 seconds( Electronically controlled is to blame, mechanically controlled would have been better) but none the less it's a good car to drive. It's very comfortable inside but the rear seats passengers typically need the front seats to be pulled up a-bit to be a little more comfortable. My car had the premium package with leather seating, etc... but the premium stereo system is an amazing piece of work, the sound is truly lovely, although this car has a wonderful stereo system the only way to utilize it, with the CD Player, Got an aftermarket adapter for AUX etc.. then it broke so just spent about $900 dollers for a aftermarket stereo which was worth it. It came with all the nice features of a modern car of power locks, power windows, rear window defroster(no wiper which looks much nicer in my opinion), and a nice little garage opener button. The steering is a-little different, the turns are really wide then the other cars I've drove almost feels like a Pickup Truck when turning but it's still good. It has anti skid system which was pretty good when it was raining or snowing really helped when I was slipping. Had a problem with headlights blowing very 4-6 months, ended up just getting Aftermarket HID bulbs and they haven't blown for 2 years and they look really nice for $100 dollars well worth the money of spending around $15 CAD very few months on halogen bulbs; I've searched the internet and spoke to mechanic experts for electronics in cars and Volvo dealers they had no idea so the only solution was to get aftermarket bulbs. Overall the car is still an amazing piece of work, hopefully it'll last a few more years, this is my second car (I'm 19 haha) and it has treated me very well and I felt very safe and comfortable in this car and have rode it outside the country many times without any problems arising it was a very reliable car it will be missed when it goes. I'd buy other Volvo when I'm more financially stable but the Chinese have bought out the automotive department of Volvo and I've heard their are many problems with the transmissions on newer Volvo's so I'm gonna steer clear until they make a car as good as this one.

Honda, Toyota or BMWs.  I am 
glad I at least got something semi-
unique.  It is a nice car that has 
decent power.  I am a little wary of 
how it will hold up, given some of the 
comments in here, but I tend to treat 
cars gently so I think it will last a 
long time.  The gas mileage is OK.  
The fronts seats are very nice. "

very pleased so far.  AWD was a must 
where we live and the lease deal on a 
similarly equiped car couldn't be found 
among competitors.  I had a manual 
Maxima so the turbo lag took some 
getting use to, but pick-up is nice and 
interior is beautiful.  Love the 
exterior look.  Very classy!  Can't

volvo,s60,2003,SaigonBob, 10/22/2003,AWD says it all,5,"I purchased my 2003 S60 2.5T AWD 
December 2002. The winter of 2002/03 
was the worst in decades. Snow. First 
time user of an AWD. The only cars on 
the road were snow plows, suv's, cars 
that people couldn't care less if they 
got into a wreck and my volvo. In wet 
or dry weather it is fun to drive. I 
like the body style, interior is nicely 
designed, dashboard and countor of the 
front panel gauges are attractive, 
geartronic is a must, good power and 
excelleration, ride is a little hard, 
the drivers seat is down to a science 
and it does not look like other cars on 
the road. Hey, if I win the lotto I'll 
get a Mercedes SL500, for now I'm happy 
with my Volvo. "

After about 6 months the car loosened 
up a little.  I have a rattle in the 
dash and a leather rubbing on leather 
sound coming from the back seat.  Also, 
when opting to shift the geartronic 
transmision yourself, it isnt that 
responsive, which makes it less fun. "

comfortable too."
volvo,s60,2003,Fredericksburg Steve, 02/06/2006,So Far so Good S60,4,"I just bought my S60 2.4T about 10 days ago.  It was a certified car and coincidentally, it had 3 years or 56K miles, whichever comes first, of B-to-B warranty remaining the day I bought it (1/28/2006).  I wanted to buy a certified BMW 330i or a 325i but they were just too expensive.  Nonetheless, my quest for a European sports sedan led me to the Volvo dealer and a test drive in my metallic silver S60 with the 17"" ""Stentor"" wheels and Continental ContactSport II tires.  I am very pleased so far with my S60 and I do like the ""auto-stick"" feature of the Geartronic transmission.  The front seats are most comfortable and the memory settings please my wife also.  I think I made the right choice."

After 5 attempts the dealer finally fixed the trunk alignment problem but they have decided the brake noise is just ""normal"" for this car.  Never had a ""normal"" brake noise on any of my previous cars (Toyotas and Hondas)  The trunk is also too small to fit my golf clubs in without taking two of them out of the bag!  Finally I have a low pitched ""rumble"" at highway speeds that despite three attempts to get the dealer to fix is still present.  Car also needs a better coin box."

against the headrests at slower speeds, 
like between stop lights.  Also, 
hesitates off the line

It has been an excellent vehicle these past 7 years with no maintenance issues.  I have followed the mfg guidelines for service, every 7,500 miles, and it continues to run like a top as they say. A most recent 1,800 mile round trip to S.C. from Ohio averaged 32.3 mpg including some city driving. The only drawback would be the leg room in the rear seating area, but trunk space is huge for this size of vehicle. I plan on keeping this vehicle for another 130,000 miles.

stellar.Keep a few extra bulbs on hand,change the oil and do regular maintenance and do what I am planning to do-keep driving this car for 300,000 miles and then decide if I should look for a new ride."

volvo,s60,2004,ccolli17, 02/28/2012,"Beloved Car, great investment.",4,"The 2004 Volvo S60 was my first Volvo, and will not be my last.
It is my strong belief that the car has saved my life twice, and has also had minimal problems, especially for someone as hard on cars as I am.
I bought the car in 2008 with only 28,000k on it, and put 89,000k on it in a 3-year time frame (117,000 k by 2012).
The car withstood 2 minor accidents and 2 major accidents.
During the time I owned the car, I replaced a fuel sensor that was a factory recall, one battery, one break job, tires when necessary, and all other replacements were due to car accidents- pretty amazing for 89,000k miles of use."
volvo,s60,2004,Linda Sinclair, 04/14/2015,"Over 200,000 miles and still going strong!",5,"I bought my car brand new in August 2003. Almost 15 years later, it now has 201,000 miles on it and is still going strong. Other than a tiny parking lot door ding on one side (very annoying), which I will have a mobile dent guy repair, and a bit of wear on the door side of the driver's leather seat, the car still looks like new when it's just had a good wash. I agree the turning radius is bad and can make u-turns challenging. I understand Volvo fixed the problem in the new models. It is certainly the most comfortable car I have ever driven. When I bought this car, I was considering a Mercedes or BMW. But the Volvo was so comfortable and had such great get up & go that I abandoned the Mercedes/BMW idea as soon as I test drove the Volvo. I have followed the manufacturer's maintenance schedule, except I now get regular maintenance every 3-4K miles instead of every 7500 miles. And I use oil for high mileage cars. MPG has dropped as it's aged, but I can still get about 25 MPG on the highway and about 20 MPG with city driving. I love this car and plan to keep driving it until it simply will not go any longer, which I am hoping won't be for another few hundred thousand miles.

volvo,s60,2004,volvoguy6, 09/11/2014,Impressed,4,"When I bought this car I had some serious questions about weather I had done the right thing or not. I did have to put some $$$$ into it to catch the maintenace up, but I knew that going in. A month later and I'm in love! This is my 3rd Volvo the other 2 were from a time when a Volvo was a Volvo so I was very skeptical when I bought this one. The body design is what really caught my attention and after doing research I was sold. The car gets an amazing 30mpg on the hwy (at 70 mph) and its also fairly efficent in town so the fact it needs premium is not that big of an issue. The seats are very comfortable and the car stops on a dime. I'm really very happy with it so far."
volvo,s60,2004,R you ready?, 06/16/2010,Love it!,4,"I love this car despite the quirks mentioned in other reviews. It's great on the highway, not so great in parking lots, but overall very suitable as a daily driver if you want fun. I love the overall driving experience including the steering wheel, pedals, and seat. In the black sapphire color, with a fresh coat of wax it looks brand new and sexy even after 6 years. The leather looks almost new. I like the rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, 3-position seat/mirror memory, push-button adjustable suspension (""4c""), and wheel- mounted audio controls. The front bumper is too low and the turning radius is awful. My wife thinks the ride is harsh and the seats are too low."
volvo,s60,2004,swedewheels, 09/30/2013,Long Term Evaluation,4,"I have owned the S60 2.5T for ten years, 175,000+ miles, until the sad day I totaled it.
What I've learned from my Volvo experience - ultra reliable, smooth running, and well built. Some driver sight line issues. Repairs: after 75k much front end work on tie rods, bearings, & struts and was still a little rattely. Replaced many tail lights (always kept spares in trunk).
No drive train issues except some trans shift flaring from day 1.
Interior plastic parts (console lid and steering wheel adjustment handle) broke about 100k.
Gas port lid hinge (cheap plastic) broke off at 35k and lost lid on freeway. No rear seat space.
Overall an 8.5 out of 10"
volvo,s60,2004,Reviewer, 07/18/2009,Rare Combination,4,"I love my S60R! Few cars in the world can claim high performance, comfort, exclusivity, great looks, all wheel drive, and still get 30 miles per gallon on the highway. It is a jack of all trades, and a master of none, other than being a great all around performance car.  I bought the car two years ago with 25K miles and have had a few maintenance issues that have thankfully been covered under warranty; i.e. the HID headlamps pointed down too much and triggered a warning, the radio display went haywire, there in a thumping sound in the rear suspension occasionally when braking, and oh yes, the factory front air dams got torn off in a matter of months."
volvo,s60,2004,KPboy, 08/07/2009,Still Great After 75 Thousand Miles,4,"I got this S60 hoping it would be reliable, and it hasn't let me down. Year after year it has been problem free. After almost 6 full years of service, it has been the best car I have ever owned.  I even live in a mountainous region with constant hill driving and braking, and the S60 manages quite nicely.  The only money I have spent on this car since purchase has been for the regular maintenance intervals.  If you are looking for something rock solid when it comes to safety and reliability, then this one is the absolute best.  I would know, ive had 2 benzes, a BMW and an Audi.  This one impresses me more than any of those."
volvo,s60,2004,Volvos are Incredible, 09/28/2018,Will be missed,5,"The first things that come to mind are my complaints so I’ll list those first.  Gas mileage is what you might expect from a 2004, so not too great but not unbearable.  The back seats didn’t have much leg room and repairs for the car were pricey because it is foreign and old.  The headlights were dim but the high beams made up for it.  Because the car is heavy it does not accelerate quickly, so probably not ideal for stop and go traffic.  Now the upsides - the design of the car is beautiful inside and out, very sleek (except the front bumper).  The driver’s seat felt like a hug from your grandmother.  Handling was excellent and the car feels (and is) very heavy and sturdy when driving.  I got my car from a private seller in July of 2015 with 80,000 miles on it.  Crashed it once in 2016 but it was minor so the car survived, then again in August of 2018 which finally put it to rest.  When it was appraised by insurance it was valued at $1000 more than I had purchased it for 3 years and almost 150k miles ago (it was totaled with almost 250,000 miles on it).  It would have run for probably at least another 50k miles no problem.  This is one of the most resilient cars on the market and extremely comfortable.  If I were marketing it I’d call it the luxury car of the working class.  I absolutely loved this car and would get another one in a heartbeat.

volvo,s60,2004,killmitchell@gmail.com, 12/09/2015,"Best Car for $3,500!!",5,"I found this amazing car last minute on craigslist. I had previously owned a 2003 BMW 3-series that was riddled with problems and kept my wallet pretty slim... I needed AWD/4WD because I go to school in an area where it snows a lot. I have yet to report on how the AWD is in the snow but I've been disappointed so far with how it takes off in the rain (maybe its because of the KUMHO tires)... In terms of reliability, I've gotten the oil changed 2 times already at my local Volvo dealership, both times, they've said the car looked amazing and needed nothing. I may get the Transmission fluid done on my next visit because sometimes from 1st-2nd gear it flares after a long highway drive. My particular car has the sport seats but doesn't have the GPS or the Xenon headlight option... bummer. The seats feel amazing, even after sitting in the car for 7+ hours non-stop!!! The back seats seriously lack leg-room and the turning radius absolutely sucks.... Aside from those two negatives, I'd totally recommend this car to anyone! Mine of course was a 2 owner car, very well taken care of at the dealership/volvo indy shop. After 11 years, this car still looks amazing and people still ask me if its brand new. Take care of it, feed it premium fuel, only use synthetic oil, and it'll return the favor!!!

So far I absolutely love my car. When I purchased it, the only thing I had to do is change the spark plugs (NGK Iridium), front sway bar links/stabilizer & the drivers side outter tie rod, with a wheel alignment afterwards. I repeat do not go to the Volvo dealer to service this car.  If you have a regular licensed mechanic, that knows Volvo's, that's sufficient. I purchased my parts online and then took the car to my mechanic just for the labor. I use mid to premium grade gas, it runs better with the turbo. "
volvo,s60,2004,ATY, 11/12/2009,Sweet,4,"I enjoy driving this car and plan to keep for at least 10 years or more since I only put 10K miles per year on the car. Besides $ for oil changes, I purchased a new set of TSW rims that are powdered gray against the white car. I do have a recurring problem where the computer loses it program and the dealer has to download a new one, on three different occasions. Also, the turning radius is pathetic and the tires grind when turning too hard. But, it gets great MPG and drives like a dream. Also in the past 4 years I probably replaced 5 tail light bulbs?"
volvo,s60,2004,Clyde Beck, 07/28/2009,Trouble in Volvoland,4,In may of 2004 my Fiancée and I traveled to Sweden to pick up my new S60. It was a wonderful experience and most of it was paid for by Volvo. I'm in to my forth year now and early last year I had an issue that never got resolved. While driving one day my side view mirror glass began to wobble. I quickly pushed on it and that prevented it from falling off. Five days latter while making a left hand turn my passenger side view glass mirror fell of and crashed to the ground. I contacted my Volvo dealer where I had been taking my car for service for four years and they replaced the mirrors and charged me. I thought that wasn't right because it had to be a manufacturing defect.

volvo,s60,2004,1st European Car, 03/24/2008,A Realistic Review,4,"I bought this car looking for an AWD sedan that was good on gas, fun to drive and affordable.  After a long search, I settled on the Volvo. I've probably read over 15 editorial reviews, scoured consumer feedback, etc. on this car, and owned it for about a week now, so here is the deal.  Reviewers say this car is not the most luxurious, not the fastest nor has the best design.  However, it does do all of these things very well, so I think it's the best value of any domestic or Euro sedan. It's extremely comfortable, fast enough and holds the road well, without the hefty price tag of a BMW or Lexus. I love this car, and received a lot of compliments in the short time I've owned it."
volvo,s60,2004,Joshua, 01/25/2009,Best Sleeper Ever,4,"I love my car. Without effort it hurls itself past other traffic. It stops quickly (very) and straight. It will plow snow out of your way (not deep snow mind you, but it was still impressive to trundle through a 1/4 mile of 6-8"" deep snow without issue).  It (literally) drove where a well driven Dodge Ram 4x4 with weight in the back could not. If you know where your car is, you won't hit those bits of concrete when you park.. No matter what you do the turning radius stinks, and if someone gives the rims a funny look it'll leave a mark. It is a beautiful car in person.  Drive one and I suspect you'll get one."
volvo,s60,2004,outlaw704, 07/23/2005,2004 Volvo S60 -- Good Car,4,"I've put a little over 25000 miles on my White S60 since May '04. I am pleased. The exterior is excellent and the interior is very nice. My only negative would be the lack of legroom for back seat passengers. The ride is nice -- firm, but smooth. Positive steering feel and very responsive brakes. My gas mileage has been better than expected; about 27+ mpg average. Straight highway is around 32 - 33 mpg. This car is based in Texas; the air conditioning has no problem cooling the cabin quickly and comfortably. Generous, very large trunk. Mechanically, everything has been fine, so far... Fit and finish are excellent. I got $5000 off by waiting til the end of the model year."
volvo,s60,2004,Edan S., 07/27/2017,Volvo S60 Is Just Alright With Me,4,"I'm not quite sure what to say about the S60, I bought it to replace my 2000 Volvo V70, which I loved.  I sort of bought this car because I was getting reading to take a winter road trip to Montana and wanted something with AWD.  I would have preferred an XC-70, but couldn't find one for the right price or in the time I allotted myself.  I ended up seeing my S60 for sale at the local Mercedes dealership for $6995 with 102,000 miles.  It was a one-owner vehicle purchased from and always serviced on time at the local Volvo dealership in town. I threw a new set of tires on, some sheepskin seat covers and some OEM all-weather mats (all good purchases). 

So the car, it's much smoother than my old wagon, great acceleration despite the additional 600lbs of the Haldex AWD system, decent gas mileage and road handling.  Like all Volvos, the seats are supremely comfortable--second-to-none!  My car's trial by fire was a 900+ mile road trip to from Nevada to  Montana in December amid regular blizzards and arctic temperatures.  My gas mileage was pretty decent over 28mpg at over 80mph most of the time.  As with most vehicle, it handles really poorly on ice, it does however, do great in the snow.  Once those back wheels start to grip, the thing can go almost anywhere (within reason).  
I did find out at the dealership during my last service that my control arm bushings are bad, so that might account for some of the sketchiness on the ice and just the freeway in general.  Much to my surprise yet again, the A/C and heating systems are some of the best I've encountered!  Some of the other reviews have mentioned the cramped nature of the backseats, that is true, it's very tight with a full-size adult sitting back there.  The trunk while spacious has a fairly narrow opening which makes it a difficult to put some things in.  I have a wheeled cooler that I like to take to the beach which often has to sit on the backseat rather than in the trunk.  It fits fine in my wife's 2007 Jetta, but that has a higher and wider trunk I guess.  Overall, I don't have a lot of gripes with this car.  I enjoy driving it and it's a nice looking vehicle.  One of my biggest concerns though is the creeps, groans, and clunks I was experiencing over the winter.  Anytime I would go over uneven pavement or speed humps the car made some weird noises from the front end. All I know is it makes me apprehensive when it happens.  It's been great over the summer though, no issues like that whatsoever.  I can foresee this car treating me well for the foreseeable future.  Will it be as good as my old V-70? Only time will tell.
Update: The S60 is still going as strong as ever. I've since done the brakes and had a bunch of bushing and strut mounts replaced at the dealership, but that's about it other than regular maintenance (oil, spark plugs, air filter, etc). I did have a coyote run into my car and had to have some bodywork done, but that good because it fixed the front bumper sag too. It looks just as good as ever now too. People often remark on my ""new Volvo,"" but it's actually 16 years old. I'll end by saying that it's never failed me, and took over in many instances when my wife's Audi Q5 did fail. I'd buy another one in a second!

volvo,s60,2004,360 degrees, 06/20/2004,Fix the Turning Radius,4,"I am extremely dissappointed that 
Edmunds didn't list the turning radius 
as it's #1 con.  There is nothing more 
frustrating than not being able to 
make a u-turn on a 2 lane highway 
without having to back up.  My wife's 
2002 Honda Odessey Minivan has a 
bettter turning radius than this. My 
recent rental 2004 Chevy Malibu has a 
better turning radius.  If you drive 
in California which requires many u-
turns and tight parking spots think 
twice about buying this car.  Volvo 
has to fix this!!  Other than that it 
is fun to drive and a great value 
considering what you are getting for 
the Money. I wish I performed U-Turns 
on the test drive."
volvo,s60,2004,not for me, 02/01/2010,better alternatives,2,"I've had this car for about 2 and a half years and am looking forward to getting rid of it.  I traded in an f 150 for this car because of gas mileage and I still wanted 4wd.  I've spent over 6k in repairs, keeping the truck was a better idea.  It looks good on the outside, but with new tires and awd winters are still difficult.  Gas mileage is good but too many awkward things.  When I turn left it makes an odd noise, but drives fine.  The carpet inside has torn in odd places.  If I use the cd/cassette player the drivers side speakers don't work.  I cant warm my car up without being in it because you cant lock the doors with the other keyless remove with the car running.  I wont be buying another"
volvo,s60,2004,Turboguru, 04/24/2009,S60R 6spd,3,"I bought this car in December of 08, only 4 months later and the car has been in the shop more than I've had it. Countless little problems, and several Major problems, costing over $3000. I'm afraid to drive the car cause I never know when its gonna break next. The turning radius stinks, and it makes random noises. But its leather is top notch, sound system is great when it works, it looks amazing, accelerates great."
volvo,s60,2004,John, 05/01/2010,anticipate high cost of ownership,2,"I am at 85K miles now.  Repairs to date:  all valves replaced, power steering pump replaced, multiple hoses replaced; etc.  Far higher cost of ownership than prior cars; S60 was supposed to be a field proven model.  I can't tell if my dealership is exploiting me or if the car is just built to fall apart.  My other vehicle, a 97 Honda Civic, is bombproof - no major repairs, >> 100K miles.  I will not buy another Volvo; for the price and maintenance, the math is not compelling."
volvo,s60,2004,Vick M., 03/22/2017,STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR!!!,1,"Reading the reviews on here, I can't believe my eyes. But then I see that most people raving about this car also say this is one of the only cars they've ever owned, so that puts things into context. 

This is HORRIBLY EXPENSIVE AND UNRELIABLE CAR. I'll get into that in a little while, but let me list the pros and cons before I list all the reliability issues. 


Pros

- Exterior has a classic, timeless look. Not unlike a similar year BMW 5 Series.

- Luxury car with low resale value, inexpensive to buy

- Great Handling on corners

- Turbo Engine available with non-premium gas


Cons

- TURNING RADIUS IS THE WORST IVE EVER SEEN IN A SEDAN. 

- Horribly designed cabin. Cheap hard plastic at literally all of the places you rest your knees when you drive. (Door handle and side of middle gear shift console).

- Small back window and poor visibility

- Fuel Economy is crap. It's 19/27 and most of the 3 years I spent driving this car, I averaged sub 21 mpg. It's only recently with 90% highway driving that I'm getting 24 mpg combined

- Sound System and Speakers are lacking 

- Center console/dash is just ugly

- Green interior lights give it a 1980s feel. My 03 Honda Accord Coupe had red and gray. 





Now for the REAL problem. I bought this used with 75K and am now at 120K. I made the decision early on not to put money into this vehicle unless it was for required maintenance Best decision I've made as it has saved me over 10K in repairs in that time.


- CD Player doesn't eject any CDs or take any CDs in. On/Off button is glitchy, and there is an electrical short somewhere in the car that I'm 90 % sure is related to the non-working audio system. I haven't used it AT ALL for the last 15K miles because it almost killed me, twice. 

- That electrical short, on TWO occasions, KNOCKED OUT THE TRANSMISSION COMPUTER AND MY CAR FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO EXPLODE! I HAD TO PULL TO THE SIDE AND CALL TRIPLE AAA. I literally haven't turned on stereo since because I'm scared for my life when I drive this car. Both times the transmission shop said that nothing can be done because the short is ruining the transmission computer unless I want to spend hundreds of dollars to find the short. Better not to use the stereo at all. 

- The driver's side leather seat has completely ripped at both sides. The passenger's side power window adjuster broke so now I can't use that window (the part is 300+) and the shocks on that side are messed up too. 

- There is rattling from 3 or 4 different areas and the window noise from the passenger's side window is super loud. 

- The Fuel gauge is idiotic. 75-80% of your car fuel can be used and still be on half way and then the other half of your fuel gauge empties out incredibly quickly. 





This is a HORRIBLE car. I had a 03 Honda Accord coupe that was in a frontal collision and drove for 130K miles with absolutely no problems even coming close to the issues I've had with this car. 



STAY AWAY.

volvo,s60,2004,aeroengrpv, 09/22/2008,A fun Volvo?,4,"I sold my BMW 328ci looking for a European car that was faster than my Bimmer and found most to be too expensive. Then I found the R. It serves the purpose perfectly. The six-speed manual is a must have. 300 horses, a six-speed, and a suspension that you can dial in with legendary Volvo safety? What more could you ask."
volvo,s60,2004,Michael Reeves, 07/29/2003,Beyond my expectations for an Automobile,5,"Just picked it up last night.  All I 
can say is Wow!  Its a great car.  it 
has all the power I desire in a sedan, 
and is so smooth.  And the leather 
sport seats are so comfortable. And did 
I mention how nice it looks.  I love 
that fact that it doesn't look like all 
of the other sedans out there and has 
its own original styling.  "
volvo,s60,2004,rqc, 10/26/2003,S60R is a great car,4,"The S60R combines sport, luxury, and 
practicality in a way no competing 
vehicle does. It is fast, handles 
magnificently, the Brembo brakes are 
amazing and yet it has a big trunk and 
a 60/40 folding rear seat. The seats 
are the most comfortable I've ever sat 
in. I have the Automatic, not the 
Manual transmission."
volvo,s60,2004,Dan, 12/30/2005,Great All-Arounder,4,"I live in Germany and wanted something appropriate for the Autobahn and weather.  My requirements were AWD and at least 300 hp, and safety was also a concern.  I looked at and drove Audi, BMW and Mercedes.  For the price range, there was nothing that compared to the Volvo S60R.  An absolute blast to drive and comfortable. Crusing at 130 mph is effortless and very stable.  With snow tires, it will drive through anything. Only gripe I have with it is the HORRIBLE turning radius....a real pain while in Europe."
volvo,s60,2004,Omajacks, 06/18/2006,Its a Nice car But,4,"I Purchased my S60R in Jan 05. I bought it for the safety, Comfort and Looks. However I have had a few Problems with it like the breaks (when they really get wet they let you and anybody with in 1 city block know it from the screaching it makes, Volvo has looked at multiple times and has yet to fix it.), Turning radius (if I had test driven this car better like in a parking lot I wouldn't have bought it it turns like a semi.) and the front bumper (Don't touch any parking bumpers with both your front tires, I've done it twice and both times when backing out it has pulled off my bumper and stretched out the bottom of my bumper. ie. a 900 dollar replacement job). Other then that not bad.  "

this is one fine car. The mors you 
drive it the better it gets ! Bought a

ni love with Volvo for 1000 good 
reasons and went back and got a new 
2004 S60R. What a 3D ride. It's what

Great on gas mileage,probably the most seductive sedan on the market and fun to drive. Pound for pound this might be the best european sedan on the market! I love everything about it, I can't even imagine what the next generation s60 will be like."
volvo,s60,2004,zooommaan, 12/11/2006,R U happy? You bet!,4,"People have definitely hit on the high and low points. This car is Fast and Furious. It goes like a bat out of hell, stops on a dime and handles like a racehorse. It does all this in comfort and safety and looks good to boot! The stereo is awesome, it is always a pleasure to take this car out. However, I always feel like this car would rather be on an autobahn than tooling around town. I am watching the mileage dropping (on the trip computer) daily. It is not a great car to drive slowly, that's the bottom line."
volvo,s60,2004,SMPM, 06/27/2007,Volvo for life is true,4,"My S60 was a fleet vehicle w/low miles. I averaged 36 mpg hwy driving the car back home cross-country. The car is safe, solid - it's not nimble like my old A4 or current Jetta, but solid. If I hit anything with this car, I will either push it out of the way or run over it - that's the feeling this car's drive quality has - heavy, solid, secure. Ergonomics on this car are superb. The seating is heaven and safety-blessed with the WHPS system. I have the 2.4L engine, and while I don't drag race, I know I have reasonable passing power. I drive this car like a hybrid - slow off the start, no wasted fuel, moderate braking on stops, and I average around 26/27mpg in urban driving."
volvo,s60,2004,Jeff, 08/11/2018,Great car to drive,5,"The S60 R is a great car to drive. Quick acceleration, and tight steering make it a lot of fun to drive. The seats are some of the most comfortable I have ever been in in a sedan. Volvo maintenance can be a bit expensive, and the dealerships are not plentiful. I drive an hour each way for work. For the price range this car fulfills the desire to enjoy the daily commute.

volvo,s60,2004,Doug, 01/11/2008,Glorified Yugo,2,"I can agree with the safety and reliability written about this car.  The comfort is just marginal.  What destroys this car is the turning radius!  The car is slow and the gas mileage is average.  The interior is sooo  small.  I have a child seat in the back and it takes over the backseat!  Being 6'2"" is a real problem with the interior size.  Overall, I would never get another Volvo!"
volvo,s60,2004,DZwink, 04/26/2007,Piece of junk,3,"We bought our Volvo when we decided to start a family due to the safety reputation. My sister had owned three, one of which saved her life in a wreck, and had also managed to put 300,000 miles on one without incident. Ours is now about to go in the shop for the third time in two months. It has had three parts in the fuel system fail so far with Volvo comping me on one due to my less than pleased opinion of the car so far. I've never had this many problems with a car before. I won't be buying another one. Makes me wish I had bought the Infiniti or Volkswagen I was looking at instead of this. "

volvo,s60,2004,steveng, 03/18/2004,Tire problems,2,"I have two major complaints.  First of 
all I have had to replace two tires 
already.  My theory is that since the 
tires are made to run flat in order to 
give the car a sleek look, this puts 
added pressure on the sidewall and this 
was where the holes were in my tires.
Second, there are an excessive number 
of blind spots because of the 
stabilization bars."
volvo,s60,2004,Mike, 01/09/2007,Perfect Compromise,3,"The objective reviews of this car are right on.  On balance, the severe flaws in this car are outweighed by the advantages.  I came from an Audi A4. The A4 just ""felt"" much better but the S60R blows the A4 away in pure speed and power.  The S60R is not terribly reliable but more so than the A4.  Both cars are expensive to maintain.  The A4 was more comfortable inside and the A4 interior is more attractive.The safety features and the standard ""extra's"" on the S60 far exceed the A4. There is a major problem with the turning radius of the S60R - MAJOR. The rear seat room in the S60R is nothing short of disgraceful. The stock tires on the S60R are dangerous; trammeling.This car is a compromise."
volvo,s60,2004,bigmistake, 09/22/2003,Stay AWAY FORM THE AUTOMATIC,2,"After break in I realized just what a 
total joke the S60R GT/Automatic was. 
DO yourself a favor and really drive 
this car prior to buying it. You will 
find early upshits kill all the 
performance and just as lousy 
downshifts limit how much fun, 
acceleration and control you can 
experieince with this joke of an 'R' 
car. The S60 T5 is faster by far as 
well as other cars in the Volvo line 
up. I won't even get into VOLVOS total 
reluctance to acknowledge a problem 
with the automatic...all they say 
is 'operating within specs'....yea 
maybe if it were builf to compete 
witha Honda accord...heck the honda 
will beat it in a drag race..I kid you 
not"
volvo,s60,2004,amspychalski, 05/12/2009,Exterior Beauty,4,"Bought my S60 used with 60k miles, and couldn't be happier with the price I paid.  While I was not completely happy with the overall acceleration from stop (which was greatly improved by adding a cool-air intake for $30), the performance and handling of the car is great.  Before the addition of the intake, the car got 30 mpg (around 35 with).  I get positive  comments all the time regarding the looks of the car. The bi-xenon headlamps, leather interior, and 18 inch wheels are must-have options that drastically change the appearance of the car.  The handling on windy roads is fantastic. Acceleration from stop is not great, but makes up for it in the quick jump it can make from 40 to 80+ mph"
volvo,s60,2004,KeepKeysAwayFromWife, 06/27/2009,Great used car purchase,4,"Purchased 04 S60 2.5T in May 09 with ~60k miles for ~$10k.  Although not as tight or responsive as 91 Jetta GLI, car is fun to drive with adequate hp.  Suspension is firm, but steering feedback is less than GLI.  Seats are very comfortable, but not as snug as Recarro's of GLI.  MPG settling in around 21.5 with mix of very short daily commute with 1 hr drives to airport.  Even with STC on, the car will squeal tires.  Wife would not drive Acura CL, but regularly absconds with the S60!"

volvo,s60,2004,M, 03/06/2006,Disappointed,3,"The car is nice looking and safe, but beyond that I have not been impressed.  The turning radius is terrible, it takes about 5 turns to get out of a parking space.  The automatic key lock has a prolonged delay, and I find myself waiting for my doors to open and lock. The car makes noises when you turn left, and the dealer said ""thats just what this car does"".  Brake pads are not covered under the warranty and they needed to be replaced at 15,000 miles.

I looked at the Audi S4, the Acura TL and many others. None could compare to the R. It has 3 different suspension settings that actually make a huge difference in handling. It has plenty of power and a huge torgue band.  I am getting about 23 miles to the gallon with some highway driving.  However if you are on it (throttle) and I mean on it (like racing from 40mph to 120mph with turns and a lot of brakingyou will on get about 12. The brakes are unreal. The interior quality is execptional. The features just keep on giving.  Awesome car & mileage too."

Being in real estate, the car is just 
the right size for me and so far I'm 
enjoying this car more than I thought I 
would.
I agree with one other post, there 
needs to be an inside trunk latch and 
the standard stereo could have a better 
quality sound to it.  If Volvo is going 
to build in the middle speaker for the 
Bose system, then install it from the 
factory... I think most people would 
pay for it.

I finally returned to my favorite 
Vovlo dealership to test drive a 2004 
S60.  As a former S40 owner, I was 
quite skeptical, since I had some 
mechanical issues with the car and the 
scheduled maintenance was expensive.  
I was trying to decide between the 
Volvo S60, the Audi A4, the new Acura 
TSX and a 2002 BMW 325i.  I had tested 
the 2003 S60 and found it to be a 
little sluggish, but the 2004 was much 
peppier.  I also like the small 
changes to the interior and, of 
course, the free scheduled 
maintenance.  It's a fun, safe, solid

under invoice...."

This is Not a family car unless you 
have babies. The back seat is very

volvo,s60,2004,Stuliny, 08/18/2003,S60,4,"Great car, easy to drive and even the 
2.4 has some pep to it.
Quiet ride and ROOMY and a pretty 
decent stock stereo (which was a nice 
surprise)

nice alternative to the other sport 
sedans out there....bmw overpriced and 
audi just too small of a cabin"
volvo,s60,2004,Julia S., 08/23/2003,Fantastic car!,4,"Ok, so I've had the car for less than a 
week.  I absolutely love it.  The 2.5T 
S60 2004 has incredible styling, power, 
and luxury.  I've never owned a Volvo, 
but between the super experience at the 
dealer and the car itself, I'll be 
buying Volvos for a long, long time.  
It's a luxury car without the high 
price.  I was torn between the S60 and 
a Honda Accord.  No contest.  The S60 
is better built, drives better, and 
it's not what everyone else is 
driving!  Yet."
volvo,s60,2004,Larry A, 08/29/2003,This is not Your Father's Volvo !,4,"The first thing that caught my 
attention was the fit, feel, and 
comfort of the seats.  The side 
bolsters just beg you drive the car.  
Its got to be the sleeper car of the 
decade.  Was at 80 mph in second gear 
before the end of the entrance ramp.  
Its the first time I ever had to slow 
down to merge onto the I-state.  Turbo 
provides a solid kick in the pants with 
very little lag.  Makes driving FUN. 
Blue gauges, aluminum accents, and blue 
stitching are sharp.  Salesman said it 
would seem there was always someone's 
bumper in your face and he was right. 
This is not your fathers Volvo  its 
my wifes! "
volvo,s60,2004,PDaddy, 09/01/2003,Very Nice...,4,"Purchased w/ the premium and sport 
packages.  I've only had it a couple 
of weeks but I look forward to every 
opportunity to take it out.  The ride 
is smooth, comfortable and peppy.  As 
for roominess, I'm 6'2"" and 175 lbs. 
My girls fit nicely in the back seats 
but adults are a little more cramped, 
however that's expected in a sport 
sedan.  The turbo gives it the added 
power it needs.  I test drove the non-
turbo and found it to be too lacking 
in the power dept.  Seats are very 
comfortable and the stereo is above 
average and easy to work.  Hope to 
have a more thorough review after I 
put more miles on it.  I'm looking 
forward to those miles!"

turner, fantastic road grip, excellent 
inner settings, luxury at par, great 
power, great in turns specialy on 
mountains and no regrets at all from 
changing Benz CLK 230 for VOLVO S60 R.

Highly recommended....

If any one has idea of accessories for 
S60R then please email me..  "

we were curious.   The worst thing to 
happen next was we took it out for a 
test drive and fell in love.  We love 
the quiet ride, the spacious interior,  
the distinctive smooth exterior, and 
quick response and speed.  With the  
2004 Volvo S60 you cant go wrong."
volvo,s60,2004,ODIN, 09/13/2003,AWESOME SWEDE,4,"I've had the car for about 2 months & 
I'm still impressed. Car has tremendous 
grip. Turbo boost peaks at low revs 
giving superb & effortless off the line 
acceleration. Seems much quicker then 
specs suggest. Great auto transmission, 
almost never feel it shifting. 
Tremendous brakes & AWD, never heard 
the tires squeal even under emergency 
conditions. Accelerates 0-60 within .1 
sec of the more $ auto T5 & R models & 
R model REQUIRES changing to winter 
tires. Had that pain with my last car. 
Added on a Magellan navigation system. 
Absolutely awesome. I can't get lost no 
matter how hard I try.
Overall a great everyday car."
volvo,s60,2004,popec, 09/10/2003,First time volvo owner,5,"Very impressed with the smoothness of 
the ride.  Has great pick up and 
really moves when you step on the 
gas.  Turbo lag is something that I 
had to get used to, but does not 
affect the driving experience."
volvo,s60,2004,Dianne W, 09/13/2003,Volvo curse,3,"We've owned our brand new 2004 S60 2.5T 
for 10 days and its been at the service 
dept for more than half of the time 
we've owned it.  The night we drove it 
home, we noticed a vibration-shimmie 
which, after 3 attempts, the dealer has 
been unable to diagnose and repair; 
they have balanced the tires, changed 
the tires and the problem has not been 
resolved after three attempts.  We've 
put more miles on the loaner cars than 
our own car, lemon law here we come.  
We bought a BIG, EXPENSIVE 
problem; we never expected this to 
happen with Volvo's reputation and the 
amount of money that we spent, but it 
did!"
volvo,s60,2004,androidv11, 09/15/2003,I thought this was a volvo,3,"Nice exterior styling and sleek
interior, though the back seat is a
little crampled.  5 speed very
responsive and quick.  Sound system good
though not as good as Japanese models
I've owned. Three significant events in
first week of ownership; fuel line
coupling broke rendering the car
inoperable, Volvo would only tow the car
25 miles free (dealership was 31 from my
location, right rear shock absorber
squeeks loudly. Might consider another
car next time."

there is perfomance factor that i still 
long for"
volvo,s60,2004,Arthur, 07/20/2003,Finally Here!,5," I ordered this car 4 
months ago after researching it for 
well over a year. The car was well 
worth the wait. It's early in the game 
for me(only 200 miles) so I will not 
carry on too much until we get a few 
thousand miles on the road. But 
initial impression is 10+.  Got the T-
Gray, w/ Black(looks more like Blue) 
leather, Premium pack, on call plus, 
18"" wheels, 6 sp, etc. The phone is 
great and the tunes sound great as 
well.  The cup holders are not in the 
right place for a manual, maybe ok for 
Auto, and that's my only complaint. 
Overall I'm very pleased and excited 
about the ride and performance of this 
Volvo.  "
volvo,s60,2004,Bullit, 07/22/2003,Swede Speed,4,"An awsome performer, that could take the 
likes of BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz. 
Although not quite as refined as the above 
makes, it's definately unique and could give 
a run for the money. Best Volvo ever built"
volvo,s60,2004,Bruce W., 08/07/2003,Very Nice Car,4,"I have driven my 2004 s60 2.5T for just 
over a month and I really like this 
car.  I have not had any problems with 
the S60 and I am very happy with the 
soild fell I get while driving the 
car.  I traded a 1998 S70 and it did 
ride as smoothly , nor did it have as 
much power and firm handling.  I only 
have a 1 year old who rides in the back 
in a car seat, so the lack of rear leg 
room won't be a problem for years to 
come."
volvo,s60,2004,biscuit, 08/09/2003,Excellent Alternative,5,"If you want to consider a viable 
alternative to the BMW or Audi, you 
should look at the Volvo S60R.  It is 
extremely quick, comfortable and 
well constructed.  Its price point is 
better than its competitors.  Overall, 
there is significant value in this car.  
There have been no problems or 
defects noted since we picked the 
car up in May.  "
volvo,s60,2004,Carlos Stevenson, 08/09/2003,The car your wife will let you have.,2,"This car was a Blast its 300+ hp 
engine refined handling and 
comfortable seats make it the best.  
But unfortunately it's styling is a 
little bland and i would have rather 
had a benz.  For those of you who have 
wives and want a safe car while you 
want a fire breathing racer this is a 
good comprimise."

Plenty of room up front with supportive
seats, to bad the leather is falling
apart after 3 months. Highway driving
is noisy, lots of wind noise crap tires
I bought the sport package with the 17""

volvo,s60,2004,skm, 09/22/2003,S60 step up,4,"I previously leased a Volvo S40 and 
with the lease coming up, my husband 
found a private owner of an S60 who 
needed to sell because of a change in 
circumstances.  We test drove the car 
and what a step up from the S40.  
Don't get me wrong, I loved the S40 
but my kids quickly outgrew the 
backseat.  The S60 has so much more 
leg room I am sure I will be keeping 
it for a long time.  The drive is 
beautiful with a tight steering wheel 
smaller than I am used to but feels 
like a race car!  "
volvo,s60,2004,John2, 09/25/2003,S60R Delivers!,5,"The car has been a delight to drive.  
The handling is excellent, acceleration 
and torque are as advertised.  Brakes 
offer amazingly short stopping 
distance.  The interior is great, 
especially the really soft leather (I 
have the navy blue and I would highly 
recommend that color)and the seats are 
the typical Volvo--very comfortable.

practicality quite well.      "

absolutely love this sedan. The fit and

driven - or own.  I almost bought a 
G35, until I took the R for a test 
drive.  I bought it on the spot.  It's 
not only the amazing performance, but 
the complete package, including 
comfort, design, quality, and of 
course, safety.  For a price of a BMW 
330 you get a bigger, faster, better 
looking car, with performance only a 
tad below an M. "

the car every day."

made great design improvements with the
very elegant exterior of this car. I

comfortable too."

to no reception on the FM radio its been
in the shop three times and goin in for
#4 and still no fix...The people at the
dealership have not been very
understanding and basically deny the
problem exists...The fourth time better
fix it or else.....The turbo with the
tiptronic is hard to power shift due to
the turbo lag...the headlights are set
to low..The AWD creates oversteer..The
turning radius is horrible for this size car"
volvo,s60,2004,Max Monrovia, 10/19/2003,Great Car,4,"Can't beat it for the money, Unless you
want to drive something ugly.  It's fun
to drive, fast, and quick.  I find
myself driving much faster than normal
and cursing those who drive merely 10mph
over the speedlimit, because the car
makes it so easy to do.  Looks good
('specially for a Volvo).  Plus it has
all of the thoughtful conviences you'd
expect from a luxury car.  "
volvo,s60,2004,peglegger, 10/20/2003,Value!,5,"Great value for a high-performance, 
fun-to-drive car with an awesome 
interior.  The Atacama leather is an 
option that I wasn't going to do, then 
decided to get it at the last 
minute...awesome.

Stereo is incredible.

Big step up from my previous car, Audi 
A6 (that was only the 2.8 liter, 
however).  Interior and variable 
chassis would be the two biggest 
plusses over the A6."

volvo,s60,2004,EFS, 10/25/2003,3 Tome Winner,4,"We looked at Mercedes C230 series and
Lexus ES 330. There is no comparison in
integrity and safety. The 16 inch wheel
package adds to the great looks. The
heavier glass is a surprising plus in
quietness. Even without the turbo there
is plenty of power. 100% satisfied with
the car. The dealership, unfortunately
has some service problems. I have never
had a Volvo that didn't go 250,000
miles. I expect no less from this one."
volvo,s60,2004,GOIrish, 10/25/2003,Great Value,4,"Exceptional value for the Money.  
Looked at M3, S4, G35, TL, C32AMG, A4, 
330i, 330xi and you just can't beat or 
match the performance and AWD received 
from the Volovo at its price level.  
Not as fast as M,S or AMG versions but 
faster then all the rest.  Insurance 
costs for this car also make it more 
attractive then the burners."
volvo,s60,2004,Rrrreally Nice, 10/25/2003,Wow!,5,"Just got my S60R. Wow!
Silver with the blue interior is the 
way to go. The blue leather is not as 
loud as in the brochure.

volvo,s60,2004,volvo gal, 10/31/2003,volvo girl for life,4,"I owned a S40 for two years and wanted 
more power, the s60 was it!  the Volvo 
moto is correct.  Volvo for Life.  Once 
you have driven a volvo you will find 
it hard to ever go back to a honda! 
The s60 offers power when needed and 
comfort the whole way.  Highly 
recommeded, body style is big and bad!  
if the HP of 204 w/ turbo is not enough 
plan on the ECU chip being released 
later this year, boosting to 304 HP! "
volvo,s60,2004,Camster, 11/02/2003,Exceeding Expectations,5,"This is our first Volvo. I had thought 
that I would never own a Volvo due to 
their older, boxy models that did not 
appeal to me. But their newer, current 
models caught my attention, and when 
we test drove the S-60 we were quite 
impressed. To get a comprable car with 
the plush interior and performance 
engine, such as BMW or Mercedes, you'd 
have to pay about $10K more. 
Alternatively, you could get an Accura 
TL which is comprable in price, 
performance and size, but it looks and 
feels cheap compared to the Volvo S-
60. "

automatic version of this car which 
completely lacks FUN of any sort as I 
knew before I drove it. However, I was 
locked onto the interior. What a 
pleasure! I made calls and wrote e-
mails and behold someone backed out of 
their special order...6 Speed. Night 
and Day compared to the auto. And yes 
I drove the heck out of it before I 
purchased it. I put so many miles on 
it I had to buy it. I wasn't about to

and only can say I'm very happy with 
the performance and brinsky

very strong and feels much bigger due 
to the high low end torque. No turbo 
lag experienced even when loaded in 
stop and go city driving. The powerful 
response at higher speeds is simply 
unmatched for sedans of its class. No 
torque steering and perfect handling 
at all conditions. Fuel mileage can 
hurt when driven at high performance

is just pure fun to drive.  Best part 
is I can take it out for some spirited 
driving, then haul the kids to soccer.  
It's stealth, but (in my opinion) looks

The car is clean, smooth, and the sound system is very, very good.  (I enjoy music and understand subtles others may not.  Try listening to the Beatles ""I Am the Eggman"" the separation from the Dolby II Pro Logic is unbelievable.  Or you Rush Fans listening to ""Subdivision"" -- you will be blown away.  "
volvo,s60,2004,sesvs43, 01/08/2004,Not Your Father's Volvo,5,"Without a doubt this is the best 
sports sedan for the price, hands 
down.  With all factors considered 
(performance, comfort, quality, 
reliability, technology and cost of 
insurance), there is not a luxary 
sports sedan on the road that can 
touch it for the money.  I have 
previously owned BMW and Mercedes 
sport sedans.  While BMW and Mercedes 
provide a better car in some areas, 
when you factor in the whole package, 
these cars cost thousands (10-20K) 
more to outdo the S60R.  From a 
performance standpoint, go ahead and 
drive one, it will leave non high-
performance V8's and most 6's staring 
at the S60 R's tail-lights.  It's a 
wolf in sheep's clothing!"

one of the faster yet also one of the 
safer cars on the road.  With a car of 
this caliber, a manual transmission is 
a must.  Auto shouldn't even be 
offered.  Pretty much set on buying 
the 330xi until I noticed the R 
existed -- on this web site as a 
matter of fact."
volvo,s60,2004,T5A-S60R, 01/19/2004,Too Much Fun for Short Trips,4,"The S60R is clearly the best undercover 
performance car I've ever driven.  I 
traded my Volvo T5 for it just after it 
was released in April 2003. Its power 
is exhilerating and it has a lot 
of ""pedal"" in gears 3 through 6. "
volvo,s60,2004,New Englander, 01/23/2004,Superb with few exceptions,4,"This car is extraordinarily comfortable 
(in the front seat) and very handsomely 
styled. The back seat legroom is tight, 
but not uncomfortable.
Open road performance is quite good in 
acceleration and braking. Holds curves 
well at higher speeds. Advanced 
suspension setting is unusable for 
roads in my area - other settings are 
good.
The premium sound system is very 
average. Why anyone would want Dolby 
Prologic for their non-Prologic encoded 
music is beyond me. H.K. should have 
offered a better surround mode. "

something a bit snotty, but reasonable 
at the same time.  I was 
impressed with the sportiness of the 
S60 2.5 T, the comfort and 
craftmanship. When i drove the BMW 
325i, i was not as impressed. One of 
the reasons is that it lacks the power 
of the S-60, the BMW is nice mind you, 
it handles well, but the S-60 is very 
competent on the road as well, also the 
luxury features for the money are 
better. The safety features are bar 
none, you owe yourself  at least a 
drive, if you are considering a 325i. I 
suggest getting the premium and sport 
package at minimum, it makes the car 
very fun."
volvo,s60,2004,Greg Colley, 01/28/2004,"Awesome Safe, Performance & Luxury",5,"I sold my expensive,loud, hard to get 
into, Porsche 911 C4 Cab. to get the 
S60R.  What an great performing 
automobile.  The 300hp. gets up and 
move you down the road in luxury, and 
I mean luxury, the seats are the most 
comfortable you will ever sit in!  Get 
the groud effects package for style.  
Safe too."
volvo,s60,2004,jlnksanders, 01/29/2004,10k Review,4,"M3, S4, WRX Sti and Cobra all 
considered.  The R was by far the best 
buy based upon performance, technology, 
safety, and comfort.  Stunning 
performance from a 2 ton sports sedan!  
Has a quality feel/look that easily 
matches BMW/Audi.  Nordkap leather 
is unique and looks much better than 
the brochure.  Have had no major 
problems, but have experienced the back-
fire between gear changes.  Volvo says 
no problem but still think back-fire is 
a little tacky for such an advanced 
automobile.  The active chassis is 
awesome!  Overall, the R is a real 
bargain in terms of price, performance, 
quality, technology and possibly most 
important--safety."
volvo,s60,2004,cjs, 01/30/2004,best in class,4,"I love this car.  I drove pretty much 
everything in the class, BMW's, 
Nissans, the Passat, Infiniti G35 and 
I35.  Each car and make has it's 
strong suit but I think Volvo has 
really created the best all-around car 
here.  One cautionary note here, I 
leased mine sight unseen (another 
dealer's inventory) and really wish I 
had the 17 inch rims."
volvo,s60,2004,NRFPT, 01/30/2004,Not ready for prime time,3,"A fun car to drive but the build

replacements also squeak.  Also have a 
disturbing vibration in the shifter

that the vibration is inherent in the 
design of the car.  "

sunroof when driving with the sunroof 
open I can still listen to the music 
perfect.  I also have the Navigation 
system in which is very helpful for me

on an S4 anyday."
volvo,s60,2004,Jumpin_George, 02/07/2004,"A fun ride, almost a sportscar !",4,"I like the power of the 2.5T, but as 
Edmunds describes you have to deal with 
turbo lag. It is excellent in the snow 
and ice, the AWD system combined with a 
good set of snowtires allows me great 
control and feeling of security. Nice 
leather interior, decent sound system, 
well engineered features and looks 
great !"
volvo,s60,2004,Fittsugen, 02/22/2004,From and enthusiast,4,"  In order to get maximum performance, 
you have to drive this car like a 
Japanese sport bike.  Do not up shift 
if it will put the engine revs below 
3500 rpm's.  This engine is just too 
flat and unresponsive below 3500 rpm's. 
A six cylinder engine of the same 
displacement would have been a far 
superior way to go. Another 75 
horsepower would help too. This 5 cyl 
is funky.  It revs smoothly, but has 
trouble with smoothness at the upper 
end of the power band.  Launches can be 
problematic too.  Keep the revs high 
and work the clutch.  The biggest 
complaint I have though is that this 
car, even though it is awd, suffers 
from torque steer.     Fittsugen."
volvo,s60,2004,Still ridin', 03/01/2006,"Smooth Ride, but at what cost?",4,This car is amazing.  Definitely an eye turner. Great acceleration in top gear when pulling away from traffic or overtaking slower cars.  I have a geartronic and I believe that it needs to be six gears and not five (Volvo corrects this with the latest models). The front seats are comfortable for taller people.  There's a lack of storage space for things but otherwise not bad. I noticed fuel economy got better after approx 15K miles.  Can somebody please do something about the turning radius and the wheels?
volvo,s60,2004,Expat-happy-with-T5, 02/25/2004,Perfect car and beats every 325i match,5,"I ordered my Volvo in the summer of 
2002 as an Expat living in London, 
England and had it delivered to my home 
in Seattle.  It is a great car and the 
service I received direct from the 
factory was out standing.  I wish I 
could say the same about the dealership 
in Seattle.

I recommend this car to every one I

15,2003.  It was great timing with a 
good snow storm coming the next night.  
I went out at midnight to drive up and 
down the unplowed hills in this part of 
Wisconsin and was amazed at the cars 
ability to just go where I wanted it to 
go with out any real effort.  I 
took a quick cruise to Detroit and back 
(averaging about 78 mph going along 
with flow of the crazy drivers around 
Chicago and across Michigan) It was 
extremely comfortable and secure 
feeling.  It has taken me a little 
while to get used to the ""turbo lag"" in 
city street driving.  So far (about 
5000 miles) it has been totally without

In the two years I've owned it, it has been completely trouble free; the only $ I have spent is on oil changes.  Front seat comfort is outstanding, although rear seating is a bit tight.  Not a fast car in terms of 0-60 acceleration, but not slow, either; mid-range acceleration when passing or merging is quite good.  Ergonomics are terrific.  My other car is a BMW 3-series, which frankly is more fun to drive, but the Volvo's comfort is the choice of my wife and I for a longer trip.  I traded a C-class for the Volvo, and feel we traded up in comfort and reliability."

bad depending on your taste.) The

quality is excellent and the seats are 
the best I've tried.

R has better lines and exterior design

torque and power you need to satisfy 
even the most discerning motorhead, 
particularly with the standard 6-
speed.  Turbo lag is nearly non-
existent and even when cruising along 
at 70-80mph+ in 6th gear, pressing the 
accelerator will push your head back

volvo,s60,2004,Iluv2raceit, 06/08/2004,Had my S60R for 7 months and I love it!,4,"The car performs great, has all-wheel-
drive (AWD), and luxury to boot, and 
all for under $38,000! I test drove the 
BMW 330XI and Audi S4; the S60R is the 
best deal. The Audi S4 is faster (it 
has a 40hp advantage), but for $10,000 
more, I WILL PASS, THANK YOU. The S60Rs 
AWD system is superior to both the 
Audi's and BMW's. And, the S60R comes 
with the Active Chassis System (called 
4C) which ontrols both the suspension 
and the throttle response. Neither Audi 
nor BMW has this option. So, the bottom 
line is this: The S60R has it all; 
luxury, sportiness, performance, and 
SAFETY."
volvo,s60,2004,Volvo, 06/02/2004,Wow,4,"This car moves. Can beat just about any
other car off the line and can keep up
with the best. Highway speeds, you pop
her into 6th gear and she purrrrs at
you. Safe, strong and maneuvers well for
a car of its size and weight. Amazing
look. MUST get the 18"" with Pegasus
titanium rims. Perfect combination of
sport and luxury. Mercedes and Lexus are
shaking in their boots, especially with
the MY05's on their way."
volvo,s60,2004,amsr, 06/14/2004,S60 AWD is a great car,4,"This is the first Volvo automobile 
that I've purchased and so far I am 
very pleased.  I wanted a car with a 
nice blend of performance and luxury 
that also stood out over the others 
aesthetically.  The S60 was my choice 
over other AWD sport sedans such as 
BMW, Audi, Infinity, and Volkswagen.  
The other choices are nice cars but 
their body style was too bland for my 
tastes except for the Infinity which 
was my second choice.  I really like 
the overall look of my Volvo S60 with 
my favorite features included."
volvo,s60,2004,Chitoe, 06/14/2004,From a Mercedes to a Volvo,4,"I sold my 2000 E430 when I had to 
leave to goto China for work.  When I 
came back to the states, I needed a 
car.  I compared cars like Acura TL, 
TSX, Jaguar X-Type, C320 and count 
less others.  I never considered 
buying a volvo until a nice salesman 
told me of the big rebates that they 
were offering.  I got almost $7000 off 
the listed price of a brand new 
volvo.  I can not find anything under 
$30k new that I can compare.  The 
Acura TSX was the closes thing to 
compare with.    "

volvo,s60,2004,vooman, 06/21/2004,Five reasons to get a Volvo S60 2.5T fwd,5,"1) The leather seats that come with the 
sport package are incredible. 2) The 
power of the car is right sized for the 
specific front wheel drive version.  3) 
The S60 receives a one rating in the 
five star ratin system with five being 
the worst,  meaning that the Volvo S60 
has the highest rating for maintaining 
the value of the car 4) Sleek and 
sporty looking but still a four dour 
sedan that makes the car very versatile 
5) An incredible 8 speaker sound system 
and radio, even at the stock level. 
Volvo works very closely with Dolby 
Labs, Bose, Harman Industries, Nokia, 
Dynaudio, Alpine Electronics, and 
Mitsubishi Electronics. "
volvo,s60,2004,Shadowfax R, 06/29/2004,If you can only have ONE CAR...,4,"This is the car to get if you can only 
have ONE car.  It is luxurious and 
fast, without the S4/M3/C32AMG price 
tag, but arguably without the status 
either.  It doesn't perform (speed and 
handling) like the cheaper EVO or STI , 
but it's a car you can drive to a 
business event and take long road trips 
without punishing you and your 
passengers with the ride quality.  The 
S60R is tastefully understated and 
doesn't attract unwanted attention, but 
yet an automobile connoisseur will know 
exactly what it is and what it can do.  
It is the best all-around car in the 
$40k range.  If you can have 2 cars, 
then I would get a roadster and an SUV."
volvo,s60,2004,luvmys60, 06/30/2004,Thank goodness for my S60,4,"I recently bought a brand-new 2004 Saab
9-3 Arc and it was a very nice car, the
only problem was that it had too many
problems.  No, this wasn't a display
model.  Under the lemon law, Saab bought
my car back and I switched to a
brand-new 2004 Volvo S60 2.5T and I am
proud to say that I am very well
pleased.  The seats are slightly more
comfortable than the 9-3 and the
interior feels richer.  The speaker
system is (out of a possible 10) 0.1

that I switched to a Volvo!"
volvo,s60,2004,D., Kleronomos,S60R Demands Respect,4,"In recent years I have owned a BMW M3, 
Audi S4 and the Volvo S60R.  This car 
can run with the best.  The seats are 
Lazy Boy comfortable.  The adjustable 
suspension lets you go from easy 
driving to hard sport driving with the 
push of a button.  If you want to push 
this car, it will really go.  The only 
complaints I have are the pedal 
location (gas and brake pedal are too 
close together for a size 11.5 shoe), 
some minor turbo lag, and the lack of a 
quality cup holder for your morning 
coffee. It is not as sporty as either 
the M3 or S4, but it has more room and 
daily driveability.  I am very happy 
with my purchase."
volvo,s60,2004,george w., 07/13/2004,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,4,"Very camelion car in terms of

volvo,s60,2004,NYT-GB, 07/15/2004,Great car with just a couple of concerns,4,"The S60AWD is a rewarding and enjoyable 
car. The Australian spec AWD is well 
equipped. However, the standard 45 
series tyres make the ride rougher than 
a billy cart ! 50 series tyres are 
better but, the ride is still not as 
good as the X-Type Jaguar.

Nonetheless, the more I drive the 
S60AWD the more fun I have. Performance 
and handling are exceptional providing 
safety and excitement.

Build quality is first rate and fuel 
consumption better than expected - 26 
mpg (imperial) around town and over 31 
touring.

Beware of flare in the 2nd-3rd gear 
change.  Dealers can reduce the flare 
but Volvo really need to develop a 
permanent fix.

Well worth a test drive."

I do take very good care of my vehicles I pride myself on that... if the car breaks down it wont be from neglect. when you want to sell your vehicle show the service records... can't argue about price with a maintained vehicle."
volvo,s60,2005,dsensing, 12/19/2008,Great personal car,4,"Great car for a commuter or a couple. Very smooth ride and I get 30 mpg on the interstate, better than the Camry this car replaced. All the power I need (2.5T). Best front seats in the business, bar none. Back seat good for kids only; adults can tolerate only if front seats are moved well forward. Good sized trunk. I've had no probs with long steering radius reported in other posts. Best long-range cruiser there is, period, better than Infiniti, BMW or Mercedes I've owned. Very secure driving experience, feels like I'm driving a fast bank vault on wheels. Appearance is very handsome (ruby red ext. with tan leather int., very nice combination). I am very satisfied."
volvo,s60,2005,Steve Sullivan, 03/21/2017,"Why I Love The Volvo S60, and You Will Too!",5,"In a sea of preowned vehicles, finding value is a daunting challenge. The Volvo S60 rises above the rest, especially if you can find one with low mileage (the one I recently purchased was a 2005 with only 63K miles...less than 5,500 miles/year!). What really makes the value pop is not just the mileage, but also Volvo's legendary safety and reliability attributes. Combine that with awesome performance, slick styling (but not ostentatious) and luxurious comfort throughout, and you have a vehicle you wouldn't mind living in, down by the river. It's not the flashiest car out there, but this isn't about form over function. The Volvo S60 has both, in spades, and you'll be thrilled to be sitting behind the wheel of it, feeling the power of the turbo engine pull you forward, while the car's supple leather seating hugs you like a close friend. Power, style, comfort, and of course, safety! Volvo for life!

volvo,s60,2005,Mike C., 07/17/2009,One Sweet Ride!,4,"I did a lot of research before deciding on the Volvo S60.  I now know, after just 3 weeks, that I definitely made the right choice!  This is the most comfortable car I've ever owned.  The plush leather seats just suck you right in.  The driver and passenger areas are very roomy and comfortable.  The back seats have no leg room, but that's not an issue with me.  I've found the climate control system to be quite nice.  My wife always likes it cooler than me, so the dual zone feature is perfect for us.  The performance is awesome!  I've heard others complain of turbo lag, but I don't get it.  The low pressure turbo responds very quickly, so I don't experience any lag at all.  I love this car!"
volvo,s60,2005,Martin, 09/21/2009,AWD,4,"Purchased the S60 in 2008 since it was one of the few sedans offering AWD which I need in the winter.  I loved this car since my first drive and almost 2 years later, still am extremely happy. May be the best vehicle I have owned and I'm 65 years old.  I would seriously consider purchasing another S60 again. I received excellent service from the dealership.  It came with an expended 100k miles, 6 yr warranty which has already paid dividends"
volvo,s60,2005,James D, 03/04/2008,The One!,4,"This car had me literally standing in the doorway to my garage shaking my head in disbelief. I never thought I would find a car with the comfort, power, style and the ability to handle Colorado weather rolled into one car! It is definitely a ""sleeper""! I don't think the person next to you at the light thinks they could be smoked by a Volvo. It says ""family"" on the outside and ""open me up!"" from the inside. This car is extremely fun to drive, undisputably comfortable seats, the best I have ever been in. It looks gorgeous (Nautica Blue) w/o being pretentious and has all the necessary features one would expect from this class of vehicle. I plan to keep this car for my 3 yr. old when she gets older!

volvo,s60,2005,PJ, 10/22/2008,"Fun to drive, with a few design quirks",4,"I purchased this as a certified preowned, and have loved it ever since. While there definitely is some turbo lag and torque steer when you punch it, it's still pretty darn quick. Just make sure you hold the steering wheel tightly when you floor it. The seats are so comfortable in the front, but the back seats need more leg room for my two kids. I love the simplicity of all the Volvo controls, but some need changing. The heated seats should turn off automatically when you turn off the car. Also, the door lock button only has one button for both lock and unlock.  It should have one for each. Finally, the key fob has a slight delay, and my kids are always a bit too quick on the doors."

(After my recent service prices engaged on our 97 Volvo 850GLT my wife suggested we get a newer car and make monthly payments with full warranties 4 peace of mind) anyhow the 05 S60AWD is very fast/peppy. AWD holds excellent traction in wet/slushy/snowy roads, but not the car for me. Why? Our present Volvo has enough
leg-room in the back for 2 adults to sit in while the front occupants are comfy, the S60 has a gap of 4 inches from edge of back seat to back of front seat. Nice car for a little man/woman and maybe babies in the back seat, not for Volvo's advertised 5 passenger (adults)."

I have the areo ground effects package with 18 inch rims. I did a few performance upgrades and tunes, so it's definitely not stock.  I'm pushing 438 at all wheels however I have 487 torque!

volvo,s60,2005,sportscarnut, 02/17/2018,Best Sport Sedan You Can Buy Under 10K,5,"Fantastic performance and sound from the 300HP 5 cylinder.  Very good reliability compared to other cars at this performance level.  Insanely cheap compared to similar cars from other manufacturers.  The Atacama leather option is really unique, and it ages well.  Volvo is very good about using common parts between their car product lines (the timing belt kit fits pretty much every car they made for a 15 year run), so parts are readily available and cheap.  It gets fantastic gas mileage (28 MPG highway on premium only).  On the downside, the factory stereo is pretty awful (highly recommend upgrading to a quality aftermarket stereo), the paint on the body rails is not nearly as well done as the rest of the body, and the AWD system makes regular alignments a must (a recommend buying a lifetime alignment when you buy the car).  The V70R wagon is pretty much the same car, but the highly-desirable 6 speed manual is far rarer in the wagon.

On the upside, average mileage (combined city/hwy) has been 25.6 for 20,000 miles (nice!) and gets 32 Mpg on level highway (55-60 mph).  Relatively comfortable for 3-hour per day commutes.

While it performs OK in the snow, the low profile tires and wheels are no match for potholes. I have already blown 3 tires and bent 2 rims.

Very basic interior, so I purchased for a wood trim kit in an attempt to give it a little luxury.  Steering on my car is pretty tight (which I like), but I've driven other S60s that had way too much power assist.  Evidently something about the model I have made it tight, thankfully.  If the 3 series BMW had front wheel drive, and the rear seats folded, I would have bought it instead."

My dad has the s80 and the s60r brings the sport back to volvo.  I also have an 2000 s70 glt which is fun, but doesnt compare.  I only wish I had gotten manual.... except in those traffic jams"
volvo,s60,2005,sedanfreak, 01/13/2005,almost perfect,4,"This one is in the top 3 of my all time favorites.  Cool design interior and exterior.  Good power and braking. Nit picks - huge turn radius, back seat leg room, interior noise higher than other german sedans I've had (merc & BMW), hard tires and weak beverage holder.   "
volvo,s60,2005,dm, 02/01/2005,This Volvo's the One!,5,"This car hasn't provided me with as much excitement since I picked up my new 1978 Triumph Spitfire.  Obvioulsy not even close to being the same kind of car, but...I said ""excitement.""  Blending a sleek, well engineered, and sporty design, an incredible 300 hp, turbo-charged powerplant, and an incredibly well designed interior, this car surpasses my best expectations.  When someone in their 50's can get into a vehicle like this, and look like he's not trying to relive his youth, and yet enjoy it as though he was - Volvo's design team has reached its pinnacle.  My kids don't laugh at me either - their jealous!"
volvo,s60,2005,eh_clark, 02/10/2005,"Solid, comfortable, but not perfect",4,"When Volvo first introduced the S60 in 2001, I was very impressed but considered such a car to be out of my reach.  However, when the Ford Ranger started to show signs of impending doom, I started looking for something a little more roomy, comfortable and efficient.  Luckily, I found an add special and got a great deal on a base model (whose standard features exceed my ""loaded"" Pontiac).  So far it has been a very quiet, reliable, COMFORTABLE, and reasonably effecient car.  If it would have had fog lights, it would be perfect.  Obviously, I would like a turbo and AWD, but really couldn't afford it.  "

volvo,s60,2005,Greg, 03/28/2005,R doesn't stand for Reliability,4,"I've had the S60R for about one year now; it's a blast to drive, sporty and luxurious.  The navigation works well, but does not have voice activation or a touch screen.  So far I've averaged at least one trip to the dealer per month for ""nuisance"" problems and technical bulletin fixes.  The 6 speed will make even the most seasoned stick drivers feel like a 16 year old learning to drive a manual tranny, it's never the same clutch twice. In spite of these shortcomings, Volvo has done a nice job entering into the M3 and S4 realm.  The R can hang with either car and not embarrass itself.  Just be prepared to fork over alot of cash at the pump.   "

volvo,s60,2005,ddd, 04/28/2005,A lemon of a car!,3,"Thankfully I was able to return this vehicle under CA lemon law. In 12 months I had taken it in for brake squeak/squeal on 7 separate occasions. Tried euro spec pads, update US pads, deglazing rotors, etc. No fix worked. What good is a stealthy car if everyone around you is staring because of the HORRIBLE squeal from the brakes. Trust me, on many occasions I had to roll up my window because I couldn't stand the noise! And on top of all that, the Service Manager had the guts to tell me, ""well all brakes squeak; its part of normal day-to-day sounds of a working car"" To their credit, Volvo paid me back in full less $433 of accrued costs through ~1,000mi when I first reported the problem)"
volvo,s60,2005,da60015, 05/01/2005,S60R - The Perfect Perfomance Sedan,4,"Having already been impressed for over three years with my S60 2.5T, I welcomed the opportunity to test drive the S60R.  This was following test drives of comparable BMW, Mercedes and Cadillac models.  Safety and the comfort for a 6 foot plus adult being a given, the power and handling of the ""R"" exceeded even my expectations.  I have not had this much fun since my Corvette.  The car hangs tough with my friends' Porsches and MBs on our monthly country outings into the backroads of Wisconsin. "
volvo,s60,2005,Will, 05/16/2005,Eats Beamers & Benzes For Lunch!,5,After test driving the Mercedes Benz C230 Kompressor and the BMW 325i I was reluctant to test drive the Volvo S60. The exterior styling is on the conservative side but is very attractive to the eye with better fit and finish than it's German Counterparts.  With the premium package the interior definitely impresses though it does lack the small details of the Mercedes.  That being said the safety features make you forget about the gizmos of the German cars.  During the test drive I was impressed with the 2.5 L Turbo and the vehicle's handling.  So much that my wife said I was grinning ear-to-ear the whole time.  I don't know what the Editors are talking about but this car is a blast to drive!
volvo,s60,2005,Brian L, 05/27/2005,The R-evolution!,4,"After looking at the Audi A4, Bmw 3 series and Saab 9-5 I decided to go with the Volvo S60R and man was I right!  This car handles like a dream, has great power off the line and the seats are unbelievable.  My relatives all own Audi's & BMW's and were extremely impressed when I let them test drive my ""R"".  I had the car ordered from Sweden and it only took 4 weeks to be delivered.  I recommend purchasing the ""sport body kit"" as it lowers the ground clearence for less wind resistance and also for a real sporty look.  I've only owned the car 1 month and had 10 people comment on the style.  What's best is many other European cars will not know what this car can do so let them try, then gas it!"
volvo,s60,2005,Russell Williams, 05/29/2005,S-60 accolades,5,"This is my first but certainly not my last Volvo...they have come a long way from the boxy types of earlier years.

Only complaint so far (I've only driven it 1,000 miles) is that it has a tremendous thirst for gas and I'm not racing in the quarter mile on a daily basis!  I'm told it improves as the engine gets more broken in-I certainly hope so. 16.5 miles per gal. avg.- "

This car mellows you out after a long day at the office!!!"
volvo,s60,2005,Rick, 07/10/2005,S60 is the car to have,4,WOW! This is the best purchase that I have done. I feel extremly safe and if I had the money I would buy another volvo for my wife. One of the reason's that I bought this car is for its safety feaures.
volvo,s60,2005,Tony , 07/25/2005,Sporty!,4,"I just purchased my 2005 S60R with 6 speed MT. This car is fast, well balanced and very fun to drive. The turning radius is my biggest complaint so far but outside of that, the car has met my expectations which were pretty high. In addition to the great performance, the seats were a major selling point- very comfortable and good looking.   "
volvo,s60,2005,ABrown, 08/13/2005,Multi Volvo Family,4,"Just purchased the 2.5T sedan. After 306,000 miles on my '88 240. Love the get up and go, gas mileage, and solid feel. My husband has an '86 240 wagon which he will replace with a '96 (he believes in recycling). We are a true volvo family impressed by the reliability and safety factor. Besides the safety factor, the key selling point for us was Volvo's turning radius.  That unfortunately has been replaced with a significantly inferior turning radius.  Volvo whatever were you thinking????"
volvo,s60,2005,mojo, 08/15/2005,Awesome car!,4,"A blast to drive--can handle sharp turns at high speeds, great acceleration at all speeds and very comfortable seats.  Turns heads as well, people comment on it to me all the time and are shocked that it's a Volvo. (got the Sports package with the wheels, rims and spoilers) Test drove the Audi S4, new Lexus GS300 and BMW 5 series before deciding on the S60R.  Others were great cars, but the S60R's combo of performance, looks, price and uniqueness won me over. Great car!"
volvo,s60,2005,steve g, 08/25/2005,excellent,5,I looked at Acura TL and BMW 330. This car beats them both in performance and comfort. The T5 is amazingly fast and the handling is great. The front seats are sooo comfortable. The available IPOD adapter works great with the excellent stereo system.
volvo,s60,2005,Marc A, 08/27/2005,"Volvo, not for old geezers anymore...",5,"My wife and I had considered Volvo's several times over the years and I finally got tired of the lousy mileage in my truck and traded it in on a Black Sapphire, S60 2.5T with sport package, gorgeous beige leather interior and premium package (including cool wood steering wheel). I thought I would miss my truck but this car is such a pleasure to drive that I haven't. Nicely refined, good acceleration and surprisingly good fuel economy. There's a little too much body lean and the turning radius is a bit wide but other than that, I am extremely pleased. A GREAT alternative to the 3 series BMW, which are a dime a dozen in south Florida. I get lots of looks and compliments. Highly recommended!"
volvo,s60,2005,Erica, 08/30/2005,Great Purchase,4,"I just got this car a few days ago and absolutely love it. It's a lot of fun to drive and feels much heavier than my 01 Honda Civic (which I also liked as well) on the road. Great transmission and excellent power. Jury's still out on gas mileage , but for the smooth ride, it's worth it! Also very pleased with all of the safety features. Hope to have the car for a long time to come! "
volvo,s60,2005,05' S60 2.5T, 09/14/2005,bought 2005 2.5T in November 2004,4,This is mostly my wife's car and we both like it a lot.  Seats are the best and interior features are great and easy to use.  Gas mileage around 24- 25 around town and 28-30 on long highway trips and it uses regular gas which at $3+/gl is a huge plus.  It is more affordable than comparable Euro Sedans and has been a joy to own so far.  I opted for the FWD model because the sport seats in the AWD we saw were not as comfortable and I think the seating comfort makes this car special.  
volvo,s60,2005,Marty, 09/21/2005,S60R...awesome and subtle,4,"I have driven an A4 Quattro and find the S60R hard to beat.  After driving it the first 2000 miles in mixed driving, the unique power is really exhilarating yet efficient.  The looks are unique with the 18"" wheels without the added spoilers and such.  Detail in the interior is very good and the upgraded sound system is awesome.  I bought the Sirius and Ipod options and all kinds of entertainment is at my finger tips.  I LOVE IT!!"
volvo,s60,2005,JFG, 10/08/2005,"""R"" stands for rocket",4,"A sports car enthusiest since childhood i chose to buy something practical after 8 years of F150 Ford 4x4 ownership.  I got tired of the $100 + a week gas habit.  The ""R"" was my choice above any other consideration.  A more than worthy competitor against its rivals this car is a the best bang for the buck.  AWD combined with superb interior design(except the rear leg rm) and power it is a purely exhilerating car to drive.  In its most sporty and agressive mode (advanced) its hard for the gas pedal to find the floor before one finds himself at 100 mph.  Handeling is responsive with a very firm ride.  In comfort mode it is like a luxury car with balls.  Great sound system, great looks, as well!"
volvo,s60,2005,Hemanth, 10/10/2005,I can't believe I bought a Volvo!!,4,"Thats right. I cannot believe I bought a Volvo. 3 months ago if you had asked me if I would consider a Volvo S60R my question would be ""a Volvo??"" Actually I had gone to the Volvo deaerlship to test drive the xc90 and found the R very appealing. Took it for a spin and rest is history. I have fun everytime I drive this car. My previous car was a 97 Honda Prelude which does not come close to the ride feel, comfort, and solid built of the Volvo. I am yet to see how reliable the turbocharged engine turns out to be where my old Honda never let me down but overall I am very pleased with my R. Test drove the IS300, 330I, TL, G35 before I decided to go with the Volvo. "

Got all the added features. Most fun I've had in driving in years. Just a fantastic car. I have had several people tell me it's sexy looking. Mostly women thankfully. Have left a M3 in the review mirror, jaw dropping. How cool the feeling. People complain in reviews about the back seat room. I don't want anyone back there anyway. Don't need the added weight to slow me down. Ok the turning is limited, but who cares. I looking ahead to passing the unexpected. Got the 18 rims and boday package, very aggressive looking. It's BAD!!"
volvo,s60,2005,Lysa, 10/27/2005,Volvo S60 2.5t,4,I just bought my volvo.  I LOVE IT!!! The only problem I have is control.  It gets a bit squirrely when you put the pedal to the metal.
volvo,s60,2005,Volvo S60 R, 10/30/2005,S60R Sport fun and comfort,5,"In looking for a car that would provide good sport handling and still be comfortable to drive on a long trip, the S60R was the perfect choice.  The Continuous Control Chassis is great for when you want to hit the corners hard or if you want a nice smooth ride.  Good torque curve delivers power over a wide range.  "
volvo,s60,2005,Ron, 12/09/2005,Good Car,4,"Car is great, I love the Acnatera interior. I have had it for approx 5K miles so far. Only problems are the dealer can't seem to figure out how to adjust the Xenon headlamps and the wheels scuff real easily. Already have 2 severely damaged ones. The problem seems to be the tire has no shoulder to protect the wheel, even in a drive thru carwash. I wish I could contact someone at Volvo in the ""R Division"" to talk about the car but can't seem to find anyone. DCX's SRT division has great chat rooms. Guess Volvo is too small??? or I am not good on the tube."
volvo,s60,2005,Gomansfield, 12/23/2005,stealth Q-ship better than my old A4!,5,"This Volvo is a far cry from the old 240 I had out of college.  Low, muscular stance with the 18"" Pegasus wheels, adjustable suspension, and 6 speed manual backed by a high-tech 300 HP engine make this a serious drivers car.  This kids fit fine in back and the fold down seat is handy.  Seats are the best in class and the sound system rocks both with the optional sirrius sat. radio and the ipod adapter.  Need a place to store coins, and side and rear shades would be nice touches.  Bought my 05 for about $38K, well under sticker.  This put the R in a whole new price range where it easiy out shines the competition that I shopped (Acura TL, audi A4, and the G35).  "
volvo,s60,2005,MikeM, 01/19/2006,1 Fun Car,4,"I smile often driving my R! Acceleration and handling are outstanding. I can make passing maneuvers in this car that I could not make in any other car I have driven. Interior is full of luxury with great blue accents. At first I thought I would not like to change tires ( a must for the R that comes with summer only tires). However, winter sport tires and high performance summers totally add to the driving experience. At 4500 miles to date, I am very satisfied with the purchase. This is not some quiet, boring Lexus/Acura; the R rocks!"
volvo,s60,2005,Dale Fryberger, 03/13/2006,2005 Volvo S 60R,4,"I purchased car used with 4400 miles.  It was a Volvo finance division company car from headquarters in Michigan.  It's automatic, very fast and turns heads.  My car has the sport package (ground effects), is bright red, and has the Atacama natural leather interior option. This car definitely looks European with its low slung appearance and twin exhausts peeking out the lower left corner.  It is so coool !  I chose this car over Acura, BMW 3 & 5 series (overpriced) and Lexus IS 350.  The sport package and Atacama interior are a must have !  Seats are tops!  Really comfortable.  Engine sounds so great.  All I need yet is a high priced radar detector !  This car cruises so effortlessly !"
volvo,s60,2005,Patrick, 05/17/2006,"Wow, This T5 is Awesome",5,"I flew to Houston to pick this baby up.  It was a two day trip home and I couldn't wait to get behind the wheel the second day.  I've never felt seats so comfortable.  Some road noise is heard from the wide tires and rough patches are felt through the steering but that's to be expected from a sports type sedan.  This car is solid, not one rattle or squeak.  The steering is tight.  I notice no real turbo lag and if there is any, the car makes up for it quickly.  Punch it at highway speed and you'll have no trouble passing just about anything.   For $995 you can upgrade the ECU and increase the hp from 257 to 318 and the torque from 258 to 328.  This car is fun, fast and comfortable.   "

beyond the 3 series, there are few 
alternatives that compare with the 
S60.  The ride is great, the styling 
is solid and Volvo design touches are 
like none other.
On the negative side, the fuel economy 
in the city could be better (I get 14-
17 unless I seriously monitor my 
acceleration), the back seat has 
limited leg room and I don't know what 
they were thinking with the key 
placement.

great car. After the Lexus, I purchased an Infiniti G35

very uncomfortable, and a terrible car 
to do the commute to work everyday. I 
wanted to go back to a sedan, but also
wanted something a little sporty. 
I feel as though the new Lexus ES 330 looks like a tub. 
I also checked out sedans from Mercedes-Benz and BMW, 
but they were way too expensive.  Then I looked 
at the Acura TL which was nice, but it 
had cheesy fake wood and didn't 
have an upscale feel to it.  Finally I tried the Volvo S60.
As soon as I drove it I knew I was going to 
buy it. It is the perfect combination of 
sport and luxury! Its seats are so comfortable.
It has a great sound system, AWD, and

I aggravated on this vehicle for over a year and then finally sat in one. Within seconds I knew this was it. We have owned ours over a month and it has been the greatest car I have owned. Extremely comfortable, very quick, and the gadgets work great. This vehicle is very stable and comfortable. The AWD already saved us while driving in ice. It pulled us back out of a slide before we had a chance to react. The space from rear to front seat is a little shy but we dont use the back much. It is a very elegant looking car too.

I did not stray from the Volvo family, in 2004 I traded in the S40 for the S60. So far I could not be happier. The look and style of the car is sporty yet classy.  I do not have the turbo, yet it had definitely got a lot of pep to it.  Not so quick out of the gate, but on highway, really nice ride. I am a fan and would reco. this car to others.  Now, I have my eyes on the S80...the plan is to keep upgrading!"
volvo,s60,2005,DNeuwir, 03/13/2005,Fun and Relatively Economical Sleeper,4,"Owned for about 3 months now.  With 5000 miles on the odometer, I can say this is definitely one of the ""funnest"" cars I've owned.  With 300hp, it's exhilarating driving up freeway onramps.  Though a little sluggish off the line (0-10mph, mostly due to being a low- displacement 5-cyl) once above 2500RPM the sky is the limit.  The full-time AWD keeps all rubber on the road, even on wet pavement, though the P-Zero tires are NOT suited for icy or snow driving.  Fuel efficiency is better than expected: 25mpg average combined (window sticker claimed 24 highway--I regularly see 30-32mpg on long straight stretches at 55-65mph).  Build quality is not flawless, but is very good given the $40K price."
volvo,s60,2005,RLevy32, 04/24/2005,I'm enjoying my new Volvo,5,I've had my Volvo for six months now and I enjoy every minute that I have driven.  It's comfortable and very classy looking.  It performs surprising well for a 5 cylinder auto.  I got about 28 mpg on a trip from L.A. area to Phoenix area.  It was a little more than I wanted to spend but I think it's worth it.  Also the navigation system is great.
volvo,s60,2005,ACowabunga, 05/07/2005,"2005 S60R: Great ""Sleeper"" car",4,"After owning a 2001 S60T5, I knew that the R would be a step up in performance.  I wasn't disappointed in my purchase.  The R has everything I enjoyed from my T5 plus more.  I love the blue gauges and the ability to change the shock dampeners on the fly.  I do not regret my purchase at all."
volvo,s60,2005,Padilla, 05/09/2005,Blast of Fun,4,"This car is a get up and go vehicle and is totally different than the traditional Volvo.  With the flexibility in performance choices, this car is a lot of fun to drive and change the suspension at the push of a button!  Go Get One!  What are you waiting for?"
volvo,s60,2005,Rob Erb, 05/18/2005,Poor dealer service,4,"The vehicle itself is fantastic, very quick and the 6 speed manual is the only way to go. It has a bit of a rough ride and a very low profile but is an exceptional piece of work. Beware of the wide turn radius on u-turns or in garages, it is more work than my last SUV. The bi-xenon headlights were adjusted wrong and it took me 3 days at the dealership to get it right, now I can actuially see at night."
volvo,s60,2005,Huron92, 06/05/2005,2nd Volvo,4,"This is my second Volvo (1st was an '01 XC 70), that I've only had for 3 weeks but so far it's a great car. Turbo lag is almost non-existent.   From the 1st tank of gas I've averaged 20 MPG in the city and the engine isn't broken in yet.  Homelink should be standard and the turning radius needs to be better.  I did get the sport package which translates to a very firm ride."
volvo,s60,2005,BlazinBob, 06/18/2005,Fun Sedan,4,"Great car. I got the Premium, touring and sport packages on mine as well as the ""geartronic"" trans. Plenty of power, handles GREAT, Sporty car and safe too! Not much room in the back, but it's plenty for the kids and they have their own AC vents back there. Seats are very supportive and comfortable. Lots of neat little features like if the wife uses her key to lock the car, the driver's seat and side mirrors remember their positions and return to her settings when she uses her remote again. Auto down AND Up on the front windows. They also have an obstruction safety that will automatically reverse the window if it encounters an obstacle while being raised. My second Volvo."
volvo,s60,2005,sleeper, 06/20/2005,sleeper,5,"The S60R with spoilers is gorgeous! The interior luxurious. It smells great, and it feels wonderful. The lumbar and the enveloping feeling of the seats feels comfortable and supportive at the same time.  The 300 hp is unbelievable. Smooth transitions, nimble, yet stable, and quiet.  The roar is not quite a BMW roar, but it is not bad either.  It is a fun car to drive........Husband says it reminds him of his C4 because the all wheel drive is similar. "
volvo,s60,2005,Rachel Miller, 06/21/2005,Volvo is a solid sweet ride,5,very fun to drive. it's really good looking and sporty in 2005 with the side molding matching the paint-looks a lot sleeker. my 2.5 t has great pick- up. I also like that it is not as common as the 3-series bmws. volvo silver is very nice
volvo,s60,2005,Brad, 07/03/2005,Awesome car,4,"Just picked up a new S60 2.5T in June, and it is one of the best sport-lux sedans out there. We were able to get every option (minus the nav) for a much better price than the BMW's & Audis we tested. And it is just as satisfying of a driving experience as the BMW (which is awesome to drive as well). The Volvo dealer had amazing levels of service, and the car definitely looks the best out of all the models we tested (BMW 3 and 5, Audi 4 & 6). The interior is a bit small (we tested the S80 too- much bigger), but it really works. This car is a blast to drive, and is great for turning heads in the driveway and on the road. Great car, go get one! "
volvo,s60,2005,Ken K., 07/16/2005,Nice mix of sport and luxury,5,"I bought the 2.5T and splurged for the sport, luxury and comfort packages to get the 17"" wheels and leather as well as other feature. The car looks great (metallic black and tan leather with wood appointments) accelerates quite well and is extremely comfortable for longer commutes. I was looking at the Infiniti G35, but I was able to negotiate a much better deal at Volvo and was surprised that the Volvo was only marginally slower with better looks and comfort. I was surprised to learn that you can use regular unleaded in the S60. The only sour point is the turning circle is on the poor side, especially noticeable when parking.  Overall I love this car. "
volvo,s60,2005,Victor Kilo, 08/05/2005,A happy first-time Volvo owner,4,"Never owned a high performance luxury sedan before..looked at many models.  S60R fit the bill in terms of performance, style and price.  Have owned it 4 months now, no complaints.  Powerful, stealthy...and COMFORTABLE.  This is a solid car.  I have the 6spd manual w/17 in. wheels...you can get very good gas mileage with this car if you're not constantly leadfooting...which is hard to do considering the horsepower and the overall fun of driving the car. On my drive to work (25 miles one way) I can average 30+ mpg easily.  Turbos are great for this, you can tweak the mileage in your favor if you drive it gently..but hey, who wants to always do that? You have to let it GO sometimes  :-)"
volvo,s60,2005,Ronee, 09/04/2005,Love my S60 2.5T,4,"Handled like a dream on the Autobahn. Back in the states, on our ""POOR"" roads and weather conditions, the S60 2.5T holds the road. For a car with a short wheel base, one hardly feels the bumps. I would recomend this car to anyone at any age. Volvo's slogan- ""Volvo for Life"" is right, it's the only brand I will ever own."
volvo,s60,2005,daytrip4fun, 09/17/2005,Great bang for the buck,4,"I compared the Volvo s60r to similar models from Audi, Saab, and BMW. The volvo provided more performance, luxry, and features for less! This car is extremely fun to drive and handles very well. There are not many of these cars on the road, heads turn when they see this Volvo coming...  As far as annoyances, the glove box is of poor design and rattles, the dealerships offer no help. It is an admitted problem with the s60 series. As with most performance cars, it REQUIRES the 91 octane fuel, so be ware of that...  The car now has about 4k miles on it, tire are already not gripping as well as they did the first day. Of course, I corner sharply at every opportunity!!  Love the car..."
volvo,s60,2005,Jean, 09/21/2005,Great alternative!,4,"The Volvo S-60R is a great alternative to Audi S4/BMW M3; fully loaded it will run at least $10K less. While a tad slower in the straight away, the difference is not something even the above average driver would notice. On the highway, just a nudge of the gas pedal will take you right into jail time! The braking system is superb and the interior design is excellent (blue dials look great). Brand recognition in the US is still lagging, but you will surprise plenty of drivers that think it's just a ""safe car""! Gas mileage is good for 300 hp because Volvo engineers got it out of only 5 cylinders. Open the hood and take a look - the engine screams performance. All that and safety too.  "
volvo,s60,2005,Debbie, 11/01/2005,I love it!,4,"I picked up my S60R in Sweden, and have been driving it in Italy, where we're stationed, for the past 4 months.  I'm not sure how I'm gonna afford the tickets I'll probably get when we return to the states, as it's very difficult to keep this car under 80mph-- 90 or so is a comfortable cruising speed on the Autostrade.  Have 2 boys, and the 5'8"" 13 year old hasn't complained on 3 hour road trips about the space in back, but could use a little more leg room, I'm sure.  Plenty of cargo space, and I love the elegant feel of the interior, and I love knowing that I've got a powerful engine under the hood, as well as a safe car for carting my kids around."
volvo,s60,2005,TH, 10/18/2005,Great Car,4,"I went from an SUV (Lexus RX300) to this car, and I've really enjoyed it.  It drives very smooth, has good pick- up and great interior features.  I got the navigation system, which I absolutely love- very easy to use, and I highly recommend it.  The upgraded sound system has great sound as well.  It's a great looking car.  The worst part is the horrific turning radius, but you get used to it."
volvo,s60,2005,sleeper, 12/20/2005,ultimate sleeper,4,"For anyone wondering what the S60R can do flat out on the super highways of germany (AUTOBAHN). Well let me tell you. When I first test drove the demo car I was sold.The dealer told me to break it in at least 3000 miles and then drive it how you want. So I did just that.After the 3 was up I was trying to race everything I could.For those who don't know on the Autobahn there is (NO) speed limit.I took it to the max.It tops out between 155- 160mph. It gets there Quick. I would run the car at 150mph for 3 hours straight (no problem). Cars I blasted. bmw 545i, boxer porsche,all audis period. Hell the only thing that pushed me out the left lane was the 2006 M5. Everything less was NO match for it."

Some complain about handling, road feel, etc, but after a couple dcays driving I have gotten used to the awd and turbo.  This car is every bit as enjoyable to drive as my 02 M3 for about 20K less.  Build quality is better.  Car is definitely faster than the 95 or 98 M3 and darn close to the 02.  I got my 05 \with every option except NAV for 11K off sticker.  Also drove the lexus is350 and infinite m45.  Prefer the volvo.  GREAT CAR."
volvo,s60,2005,Volvo, 01/15/2006,R for Racing,5,"This is the 2nd Volvo R I have purchased.  It drives smoothly and has good balance.  If you drive on rough roads this isn't the car for you.  If luxury, safety and performance are of concern, look no further.  The Automatic is significantly slower than the manual - absolutely take the aero package.  This car gets more looks than Pamela Anderson - Enjoy."
volvo,s60,2005,Kate, 01/15/2006,S60R Fun,4,"This car is incredible to drive, the speed and handling make it an absolute joy, whether you are going to get groceries or just going out for a little fun!"
volvo,s60,2005,Scott C. Wadley, 04/05/2006,Standard Safety Features,4,This vehicle is very appealing from outside to inside.  The features are very distinctive and attractive.  
volvo,s60,2005,David Draaisma, 09/19/2006,Good performance- poor design-interior,3,"It has great acceleration & handling. Nice sporty look. My wife loves the car, I would look else where mainly because of the interior design and options. I am 6 1, on long trips the arm rests are not comfortable. It does not feel like they are positioned correctly. Power seat on driver side works with the key out. Passenger power seat does NOT work with the key off. Big pain when cleaning car. Nice stereo system. 2 levels of FM settings. Two step process to change FM levels where most stereos systems you can do it in one. Very distracting when you are driving. Do not plan on having 4 people in the car unless they are children. Two adults will not be able to fit in the back. No leg room."
volvo,s60,2005,skipney, 10/03/2006,wow,4,Have the sports package that truly gives this car a styling edge.  Definitely a head turner. Love the interior displays. Car handles and drives with ease.  Very fun to drive.
volvo,s60,2005,LOVE THE S60!, 12/20/2006,Volvo strikes success again!,5,"We had a 1999 S70 GLT and currently have a 2004 XC90.  We traded in a 2005 Saab for as 2005 S60T this past weekend, and love the car.  Feels heavy, handles well, and we expect it will be very safe and reliable.  We have had an excellent track record with our Volvo purchases.  My wife likes the car better than the Mercedes C240 we had (before the Saab), and hopefully it will be OUT of the shop much more than the Mercedes. Gets better mileage than the Saab we had (both were turbos) or the Mercedes.   "
volvo,s60,2005,R_Rated, 03/03/2007,Early life crisis,5,"I needed a car that was a bit more pretentious than my Mercedes.  At my age and a sales career I needed something more responsible looking.  The volvo fit that perfectly.  I wanted a toy that was fast and fun to drive.... This car has been perfect from the get go.  Add some goodies and before I knew it, I had a 600 hp monster on my hands. (463 to the wheels)"
volvo,s60,2005,AL Volvo, 03/15/2007,Fun Car,4,The car is extremely fun to drive.  It has the most comfortable seats that I've ridden in.  I've had a couple of little problems but nothing keeping me from recommending this car.  The back seat is a little tight.
volvo,s60,2005,Nick, 03/20/2007,Smiles Every Day,4,"This car has two personalities: casual cruiser, all-business performer.  I have done two 8-hour+ trips in this car and arrived fresh.  But on tight curves or in tough traffic, change the suspension and it will deliver.  Sport and advanced settings deliver good road feel.  No torque-steer noticed on hard acceleration.  Brakes are excellent.  I love entering the highway from a standing start...then glancing in the mirror.  My mileage is a few MPG's above rated.  Parktronic is a must-have, and watch the blind spot off the left.  Winter road grip (w/ snow tires) is rock solid.  Manual shifter takes practice, but is smooth.  No mechanical problems."
volvo,s60,2005,julia, 07/07/2007,Great Car,5,I commute 100 miles/day round trip to work and this car makes the drive fun. Passing on the tollway is easy and the interior is nicely designed and comfortable.

Feels like a luxury sedan - a joy to drive. Small enough to get around easily in city, fits into small parking spaces. "
volvo,s60,2005,Karen Vartan, 12/28/2016,Volvo for safety and reliability,5,"The worst thing is a piggish turning ratio; everything else is great. This is a semi-luxury car that is a pleasure to own and drive.

volvo,s60,2005,Candy mountain volvo, 03/13/2019,Highly undervalued,5,"Very nice long distance touring sedan, compared to today's cars terrible gas mileage we average 21 all around. The trade off is you have a preformance sedan that can run with BMW M5, Audi A4, all Mercedes class sedans. This car needs timely maintainance, costly repairs can and will result from not following simple maintainance. If you manage to pick an s60r for what Edmunds has it listed or valued at, be prepared to invest another 3000.00 in suspension, and maintainance. The cost for a reliable 2005 s60r, will be more around 7500.00 I have no idea how Edmunds came up will it's numbers. I have put two hundred thousand miles on my s60r so far with no major repairs, travel all over the U.S. in all sorts of weather, with absolutely no problems. And remember this car is built for the snow, very safe in that regard.

volvo,s60,2006,safety proved itself, unfortunately,GREAT RIDE...DEPENDABLE,5,"2020 July
Still in love with my S60. Like my 940 (Bought NEW, 330,000 miles/20 yrs of service) my S60 has been ultra dependable, reasonable cost of ownership (so far consumables only) in the 5 yrs I've owned it. 103,000 miles on ""vinny"", but so far, so good.  Turning radius sucks, but solid car, decent mileage, and those ""lounge chair on wheels"" seats.
"
volvo,s60,2006,bennewing, 03/13/2012,The best of both worlds,4,"I bought my S60R used with 63,000 miles and drove it 2,700 miles the first five days (a lot of travel).
The car was comfortable, and I never felt tired after a long drive.


The Comfort suspension setting does imitate a luxury ride, but make no mistake: this is a sports car attempting to give you a little more comfort if needed.
The Volvo S60 R was made for the Sport suspension setting.

This car is reliable, handles excellent, provides ample low to mid-range torque, and inspires confidence in the driver.

For me:
City 22mpg, Highway 28mpg.
If you want to drive this car with a heavy foot, expect less.


This car is the perfect balance between the daily driver and weekend warrior."
volvo,s60,2006,mooser, 12/28/2011,For a Type R Personality,4,"In a matter of a second my fuel sipping, turbo spooling Saab, as well as my ego, plowed into a short bus.
(Literally)
A week later Saab went bust.
After much deliberation, I picked up a 2006 S60R with a 100,000 warranty for $16k.
This car is FAST and makes the noise of 1/2 a Lamborghini Gallardo.
 The adjustable suspension and stereo are amazing.
This car does take some getting used to, however.
I cannot start the engine without feeling as though it guzzled an 1/8th of a tank.
The turning circle makes you think of Kirstie Alley trying to do gymnastics, when in a parking lot.
Once you unleash it on the road however, all of that disappears as fast the cars in your rear view mirror."

Volvo interiors hold up incredibly well, the seats stay comfortable and all components stay in place. True quality. The cars is great to drive, has smooth power great handling and comfort. Anyone looking at a used 2006 will be surprised and satisfied especially with the price you can pick one up for. Just over 140,000 now, new tires, shocks and brakes. Feels just like new. Go to a Volvo dealer and just do some comparison shopping against any BMW, AUDI etc. Volvo will hold its own. I drive a t6 s80 now. Will give a review asap.

volvo,s60,2006,Grayson T, 07/07/2016,10/10 Would buy again,5,"This review is coming from a previous BMW 7 series owner. This car in short is reliable, safe, extremely comfortable, great on gas and more! I purchased this car at 163,000 miles. Right after i purchased the vehicle, i drove 12 hours straight, and i instantly noticed how comfortable the car is.  The seats are great for long drives. It also is great on gas. Got 30 MPG on the highway doing about 80 most of the time, and about 24-26 MPG city. The stereo is amazing, i ussualy listen at hugh volumes and it handles it well. As far as overall reliability, it has been great! Only a few minor fixes. This car does have a few minor annoyances, like the wood steering wheel has started to crack at the top (just surface cracks), and there are a few rattles from the dash when small bumps are hit. Overall this car is amazing. It drives great, super easy steering, easy breaks, and it accelerates exceptionally. I would reccomend this car to anyone.

volvo,s60,2006,beaner, 11/14/2008,"So Far, So Good!",4,"We were looking for an AWD sedan to replace our 9 year old Honda Accord. We didn't care for Subaru at all. All the other AWD sedans we considered came equipped with low-profile wheel rims, which are big trouble on pothole- strewn roads & frost heaves. We had some concerns about Volvo reliability, having owned Hondas for 20 years, but after 28 months and 32k, this car has been a pleasure to own. The 5 cylinder, turbo-charged engine provides plenty of pep when we need it. We would buy another one in a heartbeat."
volvo,s60,2006,puttjunk, 08/14/2006,SAFE!,4,"We were bothered by the high repair costs until we were recently rear ended by a car going 45MPH while we were stopped.  All worth it after seeing the incredible damage to her car (probably will be totaled) while ours was not only driveable but barely touched (repair costs TBD).  The WHIPS system really worked to reduce the feel of the impact and our 2 year old in the back seat didn't even know we were hit.  If safety matters, the S60 is an excellent choice.  We often joke that we feel like we are driving a tank - but this time were grateful that we were!    All the little electronic issues seem worth it now.  "
volvo,s60,2006,volvoowner, 07/22/2008,I cannot say enough about my S60,4,"I researched vehicles for three months on here, reading all the reviews and several makes and models before I purchased my S60. I love the way it handles and have turned heads every where I drive. I traded a 2003 Jaguar and have owned three BMWs before this car.  I can not say enough about the style, drive and ride. I feel very safe in my car. The back seat is small and low on comfort but this is my every day driver. I have an SUV for the family. The only problem I have noticed in the sound factor. I can hear the tires on the road if the radio is off. I had it checked twice and Volvo told me it was normal. Other than that I recommend this vehicle. Good luck shopping!"
volvo,s60,2006,collmm, 02/28/2010,Like My Volvo!,4,"The S60 is reliable, comfortable and fun to drive. Both interior and exterior styling are sexy beautiful with nice fit and finish. Accelerates and brakes nicely. You really have to DRIVE this car on clover leaf type on/off ramps-the steering jerks and fights you all the way! Rear passengers (that can tolerate the limited leg room) complain of car sickness because the rear seating position is low and back end of car tends to roll when cornering. I've owned the car for 13 months-no repairs except for a broken gas cap (broke when removed to fill-up in very cold weather). Mileage could be improved as I'm averaging only 20.4 mpg (at least it runs on regular)!"

Of the 4 tires, the right-rear tire has the worst cupping.  Attempts by the dealer to fix problem were not initially pursued and are now reluctantly pursued. Ongoing"
volvo,s60,2006,MM, 12/04/2005,1000 Miles of Smiling,4,"A wonderful vehicle.  The car has a smooth transmission with lots of power out of the gates.  Very comfortable interior with a seat that even provides upper back support.  A better bargain than a BMW or Audi; the interior displays/controls are more visible and reachable, and are as intuitive in an Acura - in my opinion.  Good visibility all around.  Really like the safety features - esp the whip lash protection system.  (Though I would not recommend the wood steering wheel option - no grip on the wheel during a test drive.)"
volvo,s60,2006,FastCar, 11/06/2006,Discreet Fun,4,"I looked at BMW, Audi, and MB, and by far the best power/quality/features combination for the money was the S60R.  The car performs at its best with quality 93 octane gasoline.  By quality I mean from Shell, Exxon, Chevron, etc., not Texaco, Citgo, etc.  Any low quality gas or under 93 octane and you will have a non turbo S60 2.5L.  Also, it is important to have the foot on the entire accelerator pedal for best results. City driving and hard acceleration now and then, yields 21-22 mpg.  Almost nobody knows what is under the hood, so it is fun to see other drivers trying to race you from light to light and being left behind every single time."
volvo,s60,2006,SCMJ, 05/05/2006,S60 R,5,"The S60 R is an outstanding car. I recommend this car to everybody. The best feature of this car is the active chassis setting. You really see the difference in handling on the different road types. The performance of the car is great. My transmission is auto, the manual trans take away one full sec from 0-60. The quality of the interior is excellent; you will see all the gizmos that the car has. The space of the back seats is very small. But if you have kids just buy a mini van. If you are going to buy a Volvo s60r I recommend you to buy the sport body option. This option gives the car the sporty look that will turn head.This car is also AWD; basically the car is glue to the road. "

Almost 6 years later I get into this car and still love it!"
volvo,s60,2006,Cristian, 05/31/2006,Good and TBD,4,Love driving this car! I bought one with Geartronic and all options except nav. My other car is a 99 Boxster and it is going to spend a lot of time in the garage now. The bad is the temp sensor went out the first weekend I had the car. Remains to be seen if reliability will dull my enthusiasm for the car I enjoyed test driving more than the A4 3.2 Quattro and 330xi.
volvo,s60,2006,Satisfied Dad, 11/03/2006,Not just your average sophisticated look,4,"I considered the S60R for over a year before I purchased. In fact, until I saw it in Grey I had decided to buy another brand. I AM SO HAPPY I DIDN'T.  The car is unique to look at , you hardly see R on the road and anyone who's knows performance sedans is aware of what it can do head to head. My neighbor ended up ordering the new 300 Lexus with the 307hp motor. My car came in a week earlier then his, the look on his face said ""I wish I had considered the R"". It's hot to look at, performance is awesome, I get around 22 to 23 mpg mostly suburban driving and have racked up 7,000 miles already"
volvo,s60,2006,Everything I wanted , 11/14/2006,Everything I wanted,4,"This car turned out to be all that and then some. A coworker owned one, but it wasn't until I saw it in Titanium Metallic that I had to buy it. Drop dead looks, in between size, uncommon ( you don't see yourself coming and going)"
volvo,s60,2006,Pleased Volvo Owner, 09/24/2017,Best car I have ever owned.,5,"I bought a Volvo s60 T5 for the its safety rating, and it delivered. I was recently in a horrific car accident whilst driving this vehicle and my son and I were able to walk out of the car. The front end was completely smashed in. This car was so reliable, and it performed as if it came off the lot that day. The seats are hands down the most comfortable seats I have ever sat in. When Volvo says, ""Volvo for Life,"" they aren't kidding. This car saved my life, and I will always choose Volvo. I cannot wait to get another one.

volvo,s60,2006,Love it!, 09/08/2008,Love it!,5,"I just bought my (2007) R last week, but I can tell you I love it! The car is super powerful and extremely comfortable. It is a pleasure to drive and the Dolby Pro-Logic II stereo sounds great! So far, fuel mileage is much better than expected at about 22- 24mpg around town and 28-30mpg on the highway. My only complaint is the most common one amongst R owners: turning radius. "
volvo,s60,2006,Tom, 11/25/2007,Company S60,4,"My company provided me the S60.  If it were my money, I would not buy one.  It is fine on highways with blistering acceleration and comfortable seats.  The S60 is not good on curves and in corners -- its weight and vague steering adversely influence the handling.  After 9500 miles, the only problem I have had is a loose passenger side door seal, fixed at the 7500 mile oil change service.  "
volvo,s60,2006,andy, 02/11/2018,"Good performance, bad steering",4,"This car looks great and performs great. The turbo gives a good boost of power for merging. The steering radius isn't awful but isn't good. You need to get used to having to turn the wheel more if you are transitioning from another car. It isn't terrible for making turns, etc., but for avoiding potholes and such you will need to jerk your wheel more. It isn't instant response like expected. The interior feels pretty high quality. It rattles a bit in my car and some carpeting on the front pillars are peeling off, but I attribute that to the age. There are strange decisions like how the back seats don't have door pockets, and the anti whiplash headrests for the front seats are too tall to give backseat passengers a good view out the front which is lame. There is little backseat legroom, but it's not absolutely awful. There are interesting features like auto folding back headrests, and an additional two cupholders if you unlatch the cupholder part of the center console (that's 2 cupholders in front + 2 extra cupholders in front + 2 in rear). There is some cheapness like if your model does not come with foglamps, the buttons are still there and there are cutouts for fog lamps on the outside which are empty. The controls could be less confusing. The radio is just unnecessarily complex and climate controls are unnecessarily complex, but once you figure them out it isn't too bad. I don't like how there is no knob to adjust radio stations, just an auto scan button. The volume knob on my vehicle is broken, but the steering wheel has them built in which is nice. Still surprising it broke. The non-premium sound system sucks. There is barely any base or clarity, and my 18 year old Buick Century's stereo was 4x better with stock stereo (until it blew). Very disappointing. The leather seats are really comfortable and you get a lot of adjustments including lumbar support for front, and they don't look too bad for the age (just a few aesthetic cracks). I don't understand how the trunk really works. Sometimes pressing on the handle to unlatch the trunk works, sometimes it doesn't. I do not like how when you unlock the car it doesn't flash the lights. The key fob will work from afar but you can never tell if it really unlocked, but it has a neat remote light activation feature. The headlights will turn off if the car is off regardless of the knob position, and can't be manually turned back on as far as I can tell. Only the high beams work when off. It isn't a big deal, but it's a strange decision. The headlights/tail lights should stay on and turn off automatically after a few minutes for safety in my opinion. The glovebox is too small, and the center console storage is deep but not long enough. The wiper controls don't make a ton of sense. You have several positions for the wiper stalk, custom speed position where you use the knob to adjust speed, low speed preset position, and high speed preset position. It appears to make sense once you learn it, but the custom speed position sets a max wiper speed and you must use the low speed or high speed preset if you need it faster than what the wiper speed is when the knob is turned as far as it can go. I don't like how the windshields are designed. They are ""set into"" the car. That is, they have a raised border on the left and right edges, so removing snow is a pain because the snow gets stuck on the edges. The door handles are the old design and can freeze, although the doors on this car are pretty well designed because they don't really freeze. I do not like how the access door to the trunk from the backseat is designed. The release button for the trunk access door is in the trunk, and it opens into the rear seat instead of into the trunk, covering the armrest when it is down. And if you need to close the armrest, you need to close the trunk access door too and you can't unlatch it again without
 going into the trunk. The trunk has pretty good space, by the way. For a car all about safety, I'm surprised foglights, tire pressure sensors, and stability control aren't standard, although there is a plethora of air bags and neat anti-whiplash front seats. By the way, the car is pretty safe, although it is not as safe in side impacts as some other non-safety-centric cars of the same era ironically. Repairs are probably expensive, but this car seems to have an okay if not good reputation for reliability.

volvo,s60,2006,Morris, 12/26/2008,A Truly Great Car,5,"I bought car new in June of 07. I am in the insurance business and us the car for work and pleasure. It gets great gas mileage as I get 31 MPG consistently at 70 MPH and combined city and highway mileage is 23 mph.  It is the smoothest riding car I have owned, and that includes two Audis. All my friends love the ride and my wife drives it every chance she gets. We were so impressed with it we bought the Volvo SUV for our family car. I bought this car to last me a long time and it appears it will do so with style and economy."
volvo,s60,2006,kurt, 07/27/2009,Pretty Nice Sedan,4,"Bought this used through a dealership specializing in 'low mileage/one owner cars'. The car is one owner- a leasee in a suburb of Chicago. As to low miles, the CarFax said 16,200 when I bought it so unless it was tampered with, that is what it was. This car excels on the highway; plenty of power, quiet, comfortable. In town it is a little less agreeable, mostly because the suspension is a bit more stiff than it should be. Mileage has been excellent for a car with this power- 24 in all-purpose driving, over 30mph strictly highway. Leather seats very comfortable, the radio is nice, auto climate control works great. No major complaints but overall the car is less luxurious than I desired."
volvo,s60,2006,judy, 08/18/2006,Love it!,4,"I went from a Ford 500 (gutless) to the Volvo.  Love to drive it - I am on the smaller side of size and it seems to be a good fit (seating etc).  Didn't even test drive the T5, don't need that much zip while I drive.  One note - I am surprised at the steering ratio - it really is not tight at all.  Just had the first oil change @ 7500, all is well.  Can't wait to move up to the C70 in a few years."
volvo,s60,2006,bill, 06/25/2006,fun vehicle,4,I am the owner of a 2006 volvo S60  It is truly a fun vehicle to drive.  Those who think it's slow and cumbersome should take the wheel and give it a good run for its money.. You will find that the 2.5T 5 cylinder engine and the auto transmisson will answer your every need. Be it speed to pass a car on a two lane hwy  or just to feel the wind rushing by you
volvo,s60,2006,j, 11/26/2006,So Happy,4,"Bought this vehicle to fit this criteria, fuel efficient/fun to drive comfortable, stylish and moderately priced.   I enjoy driving it, even if it is not super sporty, it is very comfortable, and gets good gas mileage.   I got 31 hwy averaging about 70-75 on my latest 3000 road trip, around town I get about 25.  I bought a 06, Special edition with all the bells and whistles to include nav, bi- zenon, ect., and paid 34.   Beemer would have been 45, no contest if you ask me, and as far as the bmw, this handled ALMOST as good on my twisty road into work, and ALMOST as fast, but I like the interior better.   If you need to pay for a name/image get the bmw, if you are past that get this."
volvo,s60,2006,S60R_Boy, 12/19/2006,Value,4,"It's true that this car is not quite in the same league as the Audi S4, BMW M3, and Mercedes C55.  HOWEVER, for about $10,000 less than these German competitors, the Volvo S60R is an outstanding value.  I just leased a 2007 model and got an amazing deal.  A 36-month lease on an Audi S4, BMW M3, or Mercedes C55 would have cost me an additional $250 per month - not worth it in my opinion.  The value proposition presented by the S60R was hard to pass up! "
volvo,s60,2006,Annette, 01/18/2007,Best Decision I Ever Made,5,"I compared many car models including Acura, Lexus, and Volvo and researched for months. Buying this Volvo was the best decision I ever made.  Not only is the car sleek and sexy but it is amazingly fun to drive.  It has the subtle and streamline sophistication that I love.  My highway commute is about 30 miles per day one way and driving this car makes it so much more enjoyable. Wood trim in the interior is nicely done in a rich dark wood, leather is fine quality."
volvo,s60,2006,Lily, 06/10/2008,2006 S60R,4,"This car is amazing! Surpassed my expectations. It's fast, comfortable, sleek, sporty, sexy.

volvo,s60,2006,JP, 10/29/2007,Better than my BMW,5,"This car is truly underrated.  I traded in a BMW 330i equipped with both sport and premium packages.  The S60 is not as quick off the line, nor does it handle as sharply as the 330i, but excels in every other way.  More comfortable, quieter interior, better sound system, more efficient climate control and from my experience, a far better build quality.  My back seat passengers are also happier with the room and comfort, along with the rear A/C vents.  Driving long distance is effortless as you ride in complete comfort, cruising with the fastest traffic and getting 30 MPG.  One thing this car does not do is draw unwanted attention.  The S60 T5 may be the world's most perfect ""stealth"" vehicle. "
volvo,s60,2006,Driver, 12/30/2018,Expensive to run but mediocre,3,"I don't recommend this car because while it is good in some aspects, it's bad in others such as reliability of some components and very expensive to maintain and insure. Unless you are a Volvo fan and want a second car just for fun, I do not recommend these cars for main drivers, first time drivers, or college students just because of the cost and the uncertainty of what you might have to fix. The AWD is excellent as far as I can tell, and the safety tech of side airbags and anti whiplash seats and head restraints and the emergency brake assist are neat, though not as impressive anymore in 2006. The turbo does add some discernible torque. The front seats are super comfortable, but the back seats are OK. I like the smart design where the center console lid opens into small tables/extra cupholders. Some interior materials feel nice and interior controls have some smart designs. Downsides are pretty bad gas mileage especially in the city, 18 MPH, which a minivan can beat. Also, the interior tends to develop rattles and squeaks and wears out despite it's high quality appearance. Technology is nowhere to be seen, especially for a ""luxury"" vehicle. There is no aux jack, only one 12v power socket in the front and none in the center console, the automatic climate control system feels dated, and so on. The design didn't change much from the first model years so it's disappointing in 2006 when many other vehicles have this technology. The turning radius is pretty bad, and the steering wheel needs much more input to avoid potholes for example. The car is missing some safety tech for the year especially because it is supposed to be a Volvo. For example, electronic stability control and tire pressure monitoring is not standard. Neither is an autodimming mirror. And the design of the car means the back window and side mirrors aren't as big as they could be, and the anti whiplash head restraints block a lot of the rear window. The back seats don't have a lot of legroom at all. The drivers seat can be adjusted far enough backwards so a child's leg can't fit in the space behind it. It seems that the backseat was an afterthought, but basically the car is not big enough for a family to comfortably travel in. The car has a few reliability issues of note. I heard T5 models have unreliable transmissions. However, I have the 2.5t AWD. Common problems are suspension issues with fragile struts, and my car occasionally does creak. Also, the engine is a 5 cylinder and I read that by design they will vibrate more and require a complex motor mount system to absorb vibrations from the cabin. Well, on most of these cars the motor mounts will be shot and a good amount of vibration can be felt in the cabin which is really uncomfortable and gets old. It feels like you're riding in a Model T! And there is a design flaw I've heard of but I haven't experienced it where there is a PVC system in the car that is designed weirdly by Volvo which can get clogged up and cause engine problems. This might matter only to those on a tight budget, but from an extended outlook point of view, this car has a turbo and they do go bad after a while. Other cars might just be more reliable. I am not a mechanic but just wanted to mention it, but my point is that despite the age of the design of this car, it is not a tried and true design and there is not a whole lot of info on the internet to truly decide it's reliability. However you can say that certain GM models for example are reliable because they are such an old design but they are known to have this or that problem because so many people owned one. So other cars are much easier to research and decide about their reliability. Also chances are that they will be cheaper to fix. The Volvo S60 however works in weird ways and you should find a good Volvo mechanic as not all mechanics are as versed in these cars. Plus it is expensive
 to fix and insure, more so than a BMW of the same age. I really like the AWD and some of the safety tech, but the handling isn't great and neither is the spaciousness, MPG, tech, reliability, cost of repairs, insurance, and ""certainty"" which a lot of cheaper domestic cars bring you. What I mean by certainty is that they are good, old designs for the most part and if something fails the neighborhood mechanic won't charge an arm and a leg for repairs, and insurance won't be exorbitant. If you are a Volvo fan and this is your second or third car, perhaps it will be OK and the problems I mentioned don't matter to you I'm sure, but if you depend on your single car and you don't have much money, I'm not sure if I would recommend these even if the value is dirt cheap for a seemingly fancy European car.

volvo,s60,2006,Acer, 10/20/2005,Sleeper,5,"After a long research period and a slew of test drives (shucks) I finally selected the S60 R.

None of the cars match all three criteria, but the S60 R did the best at the most affordable price.  I also like the fact you don't see them everywhere like you would with a BMW.  And aside from a few small ""R""s there is nothing that readily identifies this Volvo as the hot rod version.  The S60 R is the atheltic WRX STi that has grown up and wearing a suit and tie."

Fast, safe, stylish and 10 to 15K less expensive than an Audi S4 or BMW 540i.Great interior(except for the roof liner). The Brembo brakes inspire confidence to drive faster than you should. The shifter is quick and precise but the clutch is a little quirky. Steering could be a little more precise, but this is subjective as my last car was an Audi TT. The suspension in either sport or advanced provides a nice tight ride and in comfort(which I use when my wife is with me) is still fun and very smooth.

volvo,s60,2006,Annette Ferrell, 04/20/2007,Volvo Lover,5,"I searched many months for a car and my decision came down to the Volvo and the Acura TL.  I love this Volvo - it's quick, FUN to drive, yet has a feeling of sophistication and sexy!  This car feels like it's floating on the road - watch your speedometer - you'll be at 90 mph before you know it. This car is comfortable and well appointed.  Leg room in the back is a little tight, but I rarely have rear passengers so no problem. I drive about 80% highway and consistently get 27-28 mpg."
volvo,s60,2006,chicagoangel, 03/31/2008,I love this car,4,"I traded in a 98 S70 with hesitation. I love this car. My husband loves to drive my car and he hated my S70. I only wish given the price of gas, it had better mileage. At the same time, I have gotten better mileage both city and highway than what is on the specs. Highway I get 32 mpg. It seems like Volvo listened to their customers in what they wanted/needed in their next generation Volvo. Now, all they need to do is get better gas mileage."
volvo,s60,2006,M Syd, 04/28/2008,"Redefines ""Sleeper""",4,"99.9% of the planet thinks Volvo is about safe, family style vehicles. But speed trumps safety if you slap an R badge on the boot! This car is the ultimate in sexy edge exterior design and endless creature comforts. Not seats, thrones!  Ive had the car for a little over two years now and everyday I cant wait to get inside! Especially now with a custom 3 turbo-back exhaust (solves your turbo lag problem BTW). ZERO maintenance issues save for the 2006 software gremlin that magically turns your R into a 240 DL. Great Fuel economy! Performance upgrades are spendy, but TRANSFORM the car into a track warrior (can you spell IPD.com?)  I LOVE THIS CAR! "
volvo,s60,2006,Winegirl, 01/24/2020,Solid like a rock,5,"I bought my 2006 Volvo S60 2.5T new.  This was my second Volvo, fell in love when I had a Volvo rental for a week.  My vehicle has 50,000 miles on it.  I have changed the timing belt and tensioner, the tires and the battery, just because of the age, not due to any issues.  I have had exactly zero mechanical issues with this vehicle.  Due to the composite body panels, the car looks showroom new and I live in WI where winter road salt is death to vehicles.  The door slams with a solid feeling. The seats are maximally comfortable.  The vehicle feels solid and safe.  Backseat is tight so not good as a family vehicle.  Power is exceptional: there is a slight turbo lag and then the thing takes off like a jado unit.  It is kind of funny to see the staid, solid, Swedish ""refrigerator"" (old term) leave others it it's dust.   I love my Volvo and will probably keep it until I die.

I am sorry to say this car was also a lemon. The wheel bearings went out, rear tail lights went out, it burned 1 quart of oil every 1000 miles, the chassis started to loosen up after 6000 miles. I just got rid of the car and took a financial hit, but I was tired of driving a loaner more than the actual car. DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE (unless you want to know your service people very well)  "
volvo,s60,2006,dlester6909 , 12/28/2006,Volvo S60,5,"Best car I have ever had. Its very responsive and agile. 

The smooth drive is what I expected from a midsized luxury sedan. The power from this 2.5 must not to be overlooked. I would encourage all to just take a test drive to see what I mean."
volvo,s60,2006,Bill, 01/16/2009,My S60 Saved My Life,4,"05 S60 AWD. Spun last weekend on black ice. No time to brake. 65mph into wire retaining guardrail. Absolutely no injury expect a glass shard in my hand. The retaining wires stopped 6 inches from my head. The EMTs, Police, Fire, Insurance Adjuster and Autobody man all stated. If you were in anything but a Volvo you would have been decapitated!! I pick up my used 06 S60 FWD next week. Don't opt for AWD, slight jack up in rear gives funky handling, less mileage, more to go wrong, and noticible front to rear and back power transfers."
volvo,s60,2006,Rob, 03/05/2010,No longer a big Volvo fan,4,"I have owned and loved 5 Volvos including this one and an XC90 that we still have.  I bought the 06 S60 with about 47k miles on it and as soon as the warranty expired, it was in the shop about every 6 weeks with $500- $1500 repairs.  A/C compressor disintegrated, then a A/C o-ring blew out (all during July and August), the engine air flow sensor failed twice, front end needed frequent alignment, right front passenger window would go up and down without me doing anything, the radio wouldn't change stations some times. Traded it in after 9 months on a 2009 Saab 93.  "
volvo,s60,2006,Mickey, 01/27/2007,Just dumped my S60,2,"I realized early that this car was not perfect.  The driver's seat was uncomfortable, the turning radius must be almost 1/2 mile, the back seat is almost useless.  But it handles well, has good power and is fairly good on gas so I kept it. 4 months later the odometer turned over 7500 miles and a written notice lights up on the instrument panel to announce that it is time for scheduled maintenance. I exceed the maintenance and frequency called for by Volvo  ... but not at the dealer. I told the dealer when I got the car that I'd go elsewhere for service based on convenience.  Now they tell me that they'll turn this notice off every 7500 miles for $40.  Enoughs enough.  Traded it 3 hours later"
volvo,s60,2006,Case B., 05/12/2009,2006 S60 T5,4,"I've been driving this fine machine for a month now and think I have found the perfect car. Responsive, stylish, sporty and loaded up. The gas mileage really surprised me. I was told to expect about 24 mpg on average but have been at 27-28."
volvo,s60,2006,Lynne, 10/23/2009,Disappointed With Car,2,I purchased this care when I gave my Nissan Altima to my daughter due to her car being totaled.  I am totally disappointed with the care and am trading it in after only having it for less than two years.  The turning radius is bad and the main problem is the alignment.  I have had to buy two complete new sets of tires during that period.  Last time was because I had a blowout on the highway.  The alignment has to be redesigned so it isn't so sensitive to any bumps.  Car definitely didn't live up to my expectations.
volvo,s60,2006,Sue, 01/19/2006,No luck for me,2,"I was trying to save a bit of money so after doing much research, I turned in my BMW for a Volvo.  In 4 months time, I have had 3 tire blow outs, replaced a rim, had a faulty passanger airbag that does not work(the sensor had to be ordered since the car is so new) and my ipod adaptor broke.  I was tired of spending more time at Volvo service than driving the car. I was fed up with all this happening with a 4 month old car. Today I happily traded the Volvo in for a BMW which I know will be reliable and I am extrememly happy with my decision and my new car."
volvo,s60,2006,LS, 10/19/2005,Not as good as I thought,4,"I owned a 98 Mercedes C230 and was thinking about getting a new one.  Instead I bought this car.  I was in for a surprise.  Here are the major issues I have found with this car: poor turning radius, loud engine noise, very rough ride and between 50 -  60 mph the car struggles with what the right shift should be so the steering wheel vibrates ever so slightly.  Then there are the little things: headrest doesn't move, you have a button to open your gas tank but not one for your trunk, your driver door does not lock when the car takes off, the key is extremely bulky and heavy (I am a woman so I put it in my purse, feel bad for the guys that have to carry it around in their pockets)."
volvo,s60,2006,Janez Narojnak, 08/15/2005,Best Car I've Owned,4,"Performance is astounding! 5.4 seconds to 60 with the stick, or 6.0 with the automatic. Great handling and tire grip. . 4-piston Brembo front and rear brakes stop on a dime. The BEST feature is the adjustable suspension, which has 3 positions: Comfort, Sport, amd Agreesive, which increase suspension stiffness and enhance handling further! And the agressive mode puts the transmission in the Sport mode, which inceases acceleration! Comfort, considering the 18"" wheels, is very good, but don't expect the ride to be as soft as a Buick. Also, rear seat is a bit cramped. Just one more inch of leg room would help! Great reliabilty, great durability/build quality, and excellent value! Phenomenal car!"
volvo,s60,2006,David Belford, 08/31/2005,Hidden Luxury,4,"After looking at Audi, Bmw, Mercedes, Saab, I happened upon a Volvo dealer more to waste time than to purchase. Even when I visited the auto show in Febuary, I walked past their display. Took a S60 2.5 turbo sport for a drive and bought it on the spot. Was hit broadside at 50 mph 2 weeks later and walked away with no injuries"

volvo,s60,2006,Chris, 10/26/2005,Good Driving,4,This car is fast and fun to drive. Handles like a real tight sports car. High performance. Like it better than the Acura TL  the gas mileage is not good but has improved since the car is more broken in. (25 on the highway at 1800 miles).
volvo,s60,2006,Fisher, 03/11/2006,Love This Car !!!,4,Traded in my '01 XC70 with 80k miles (always ran perfectly) for a '06 S60R. I absolutely love this car. Handles amazingly well in the snow as well. 
volvo,s60,2006,Bob, 04/05/2006,My Second T5,5,"I love my first T5 but the second one is so much more.  Now comes standard with sport supension, added the 4-C chaisis control with  a 6 speed standard.  This car has it all over the BMW 330 and costs less.  In fact this T5 had more and was less than my 2003 model!"
volvo,s60,2006,spinner, 05/19/2006,Jack of All Trades,4,"I wanted a performance car, but my wife said I had to get a sedan.  I initially looked at an STI, but figured I'd need a kidney transplant after a long trip.  I'd never heard of the S60R, but when I learned about it, I found it fit my lifestyle to a ""T"".  It's a sports car when I want it to be, and a people hauler when it needs to be.  The trunk is surprisingly large.  Passengers can't stop commenting on how supple the leather is.  I can't wait to go to work in the morning because I get to drive my car there.  I bet it'd be a kick on the racetrack...on/off ramps are a hoot.  This is the best car I've ever owned.  Almost as fast an S4 for 10-15 grand less."
volvo,s60,2006,Cable knit sweater, 06/03/2006,....good value,5,"When the lease on my Saab 9-3 recently expired I researched available replacements. The ""usual suspects"" from Japan, Germany and Sweden....  The Volvo S-60T met my needs.  We have owned 3 Volvos in the past and have been satisfied.  The combination of features, adding the Luxury and Sport packages, and price incentives at the time of lease,  were not matched by the competition. Front seat comfort is exemplary , rear seat legroom is tight, though the seats themselves are comfortable.  The handling is excellent, ride comfortable and fit and finish is flawless. After one month I am thoroughly satisfied."
volvo,s60,2006,ben, 06/15/2006,sport tires to week,4,"The wife and I love the S60.  It makes her feal special when she visits patients.  We love the quality and the safety for us and our daughter.  The sage green is a pretty color, not to flashy, but elegant.  Car is comfortable for the three of us and can hold all of my wifes nursing supplies in the trunk.  It is a rolling ambulance.  The dash is clean and simple.  The radio can blast METALICA very well.  The sport tires are very week and are not worth the money.  The seats are the most comfortable I have seet yet and I have driven Lexas, MB, BMW, and others.  I am kind of round and they support me very well.  Being Sweedish drew me to the car, but the comfort is what sold me. "
volvo,s60,2006,Hannah Keller, 06/16/2006,Great Value,4,"I considered and test drove the Lexus GS300, Acura Rl, the Infiniti G45 as well as the Volvo S80. Safety, price, reliability, driving fun, ease of handling, comfort, gas mileage, power and visibility were my criteria. The Volvo s60 beat all the others hands down. "
volvo,s60,2006,Fekix, 07/03/2006,Great Car !!,4,"The car is great. Where I live you don't see many Volvo's so we get lots of heads turning. The car rides smooth as has plenty of power, the seats or the most comfortable I have sat in."
volvo,s60,2006,MyS60RRR, 07/22/2006,Peace of mind,5,"I have had a lot of cars over the years, but the Volvo S60 R sedan is probably the most fun to Drive and the safest. I traded in my Infiniti G35 coupe for the R car. I like being able to select my suspension setting from comfort (soft) to Advanced (Stiff) where you can feel not only feel the bumps in the road but also the cracks. The acceleration is outstanding. The car is also all wheel drive and will be useful in the winter. "
volvo,s60,2006,sfoster, 07/29/2005,Best sedan on paper and on the road,5,I test drove many comparable sedans but could not get past the S60R's choice of features and performance.  The car is a sleeper but still has an exclusive factor.  4-C suspension is great and the 6-speed is smooth.  Truly nothing like it for the price (I got if for 9k under MSRP!) and performance.
volvo,s60,2006,TTRx, 08/06/2005,Wow Fast Euro on the Cheap.,4,300 HP with a very stealth look.  Makes the Nissan 265 HP Commercial look slow.  I have had the car for a few weeks and can not overstate how great the fit and finish is.  The first choice was safety (has too many airbags to list) and getting great performance what a bonus!  I might look at the xc90 to replace my BMW X5!
volvo,s60,2006,David Kasten, 10/06/2005,Wow!,4,This is overall a great car and fantastic value for money.  It is an extremely comfortable car with a great ride.  Pickup is extremely smooth and vibrant.
volvo,s60,2006,abjammin, 10/05/2005,"Fun to drive, good looking, really nice",4,"Made a decision to purchase this car after evaluating it and several others. Very happy with my choice.  BMW was nice but everything is a la carte.  Volvo included all the features I needed/wanted in a beautiful pkg that's a blast to drive.  Cool looking and very comfortable interior.  Only warning is that the sport pkg skirts are very low and the steering in tight places - parking lots is not very tight.  Once you get used to it, it's fine."
volvo,s60,2006,Contaxian, 10/15/2005,Safe and Fast,4,"After one initial problem with a connector for the 4C system, which was repaired very efficiently, this car is absolutely a joy to own.  I put on a lot of highway mileage and am constantly surprised at the reserve of power available.  Ramps and corners can be taken safely at speeds that would couse wrecks in other cars.  The Canadian model comes with every option (except snow tires) that anyone needs or could want.  I considered Audi, BMW and G35, but these cars just don't have the same power/safety per dollar value (the Audi and G35 are also very unattractive vehicles, in my opinion).  BMW (M3)is too small, lacks 4WD, expensive to repair and more suitable for people who want snob appeal."
volvo,s60,2006,bkinchlt, 11/03/2005,S-60 rocks!!,4,"There was an initial problem with the starter fuse, causing the car to die twice, but since then it has run flawlessly.  The turbo kicks in immediately (I don't know what they mean when they say lag, because there is none.)  This is the most comfortable car to take on a long trip.  You can't beat Volvo's seats. "
volvo,s60,2006,Jim, 11/11/2005,Couldn't be happier,4,"I have owned my S60 for three months, and have 2,400 miles on it. The car has performed perfectly, with no flaws mechanically or in its worksmanship. I enjoy the interior comfort, and the turbocharged engine, which really jumps when you punch the pedal. I get about 21 mpg in town, and 29 mpg on the open road. The car is agile on the road, feels firm, and gives a smooth ride. To me, it's a much better car and value than competitors at Acura, BMW and Lexus."
volvo,s60,2006,tanya, 11/16/2005,T5 Volvo s60,5,"I feel good knowing my children are in a safe car. It drives like a new car after 40,000 miles."
volvo,s60,2006,Mike B, 01/30/2006,Nice additio0n to the Volvo line-up,4,"Was looking for a car for my wife that had safety, comfort, looks and speed.  Also didn't want a common choice (Audi, Infinity, Acura, BMW) however we tested them all.  The S60R was a real suprise in the interior department - VERY plush and comfortable.  Back seat is for children only, though.  Trunk is large, and doors are easy to enter/exit.  Safety features are everywhere. Exterior is real sharp with sleek lines and sporty look.  The fun part of this car is it's speed and handling.  High velocity going around a big bend in ""advanced"" is thrilling - tight with great control.  Not the sweetest of sounds when under full throttle, but does grow on you.  Brakes are teriffic."
volvo,s60,2006,Kim, 03/29/2006,Love my S60,4,"My parents have owned Volvos for the past 20 years and have never had a problem.  So when it was my turn to 'move up in the car world' I was excited with how far Volvo has come in design!  I looked at Acura and Mercedes and just melted into Volvo's seats. After going to our regular Volvo dealer, I was sold, at 8:45 at night!  I am extremely satisfied with my decision. I was actually originally looking into the S40, however with the financing/leasing deals for the S60, it turned out to be a better deal...and more room in the car!"
volvo,s60,2006,righter, 04/02/2006,Unsuspecting S60R,4,"We had never even considered looking at a Volvo and were looking primarily at Audi's when a teenager mentioned that we should try the s60r.  Best advice!  We loved it and bought it.  More luxury than we expected, handles amazingly and so damn fast!  It was a surprise to us and we are so happy with it - yes we agree about the turning radius though, a sacrifice we are willing to make."
volvo,s60,2006,Gemini, 05/28/2006,S60 Volvo 2.5T,5,"alot of fun to drive. Holds the road better than originally expected. Fuel economy is better than expected as well. 208 hp have plenty of power. The leather seats are very comfortable, especially on long drives. The sound system is awesome. The fold down seats are also a great feature."
volvo,s60,2006,outlawez, 06/26/2006,Volvo S60R,5,"Excellent car...very roomy throughout the front seats, rear seating could be larger.  Safety features on this car are top-notch.  When considering a safe, fun four door nothing else compares."
volvo,s60,2006,bigt, 08/13/2006,Great Car,4,"This has been an awesome vehicle. It looks great and really moves. It really is a kick to drive. It may not be as refined as the BMW 3 series, but it is alot of fun and much less expensive. I got a great deal and I'm quite pleased.   "
volvo,s60,2006,Tag, 10/26/2020,"After 11 years & 95K miles, it's still a good car",4,"This has been a good car. I wanted something fast and safe mountain roads; and the T5 fits the bill. It's large, but handles curves well and has significant torque. The torque steer is pronounced though, and can be unnerving if you don't expect it. (Most front-wheel drive cars don't have torque steer because they don't have a much horse power as the T5 does.) 

There is ample room up front for large adults, but the back seat is only suitable for children. The cruise control and volume buttons are in a place on the wheel that is prone for accidental engagement.  The seats are comfortable and it's been reliable compared to the German offerings. I will gladly sacrifice the better speed and handling of Mercedes, BMW and Audi for Volvo's better reliability. However, Volvo has been purchased by a Chinese company so the reliability of future models may differ.

I've had some problems in 11 years though: the rubber trim around the windshield is VERY substandard. It's brittle, cracked, breaks off and now looks very bad.
The turbo charge air hose bursts in the exact same place every 30k miles, disabling the car.
The lumbar adjustment has broken, as has the power window, door handle. Not bad for a decade of use.  
"
volvo,s60,2007,jetwet1, 06/28/2010,Shocked,4,"The first car we test drove was a '07 S60, we both liked the car a lot but we had other cars to test drive. After test driving every 4 door salon on the market we came back to the Volvo, it was everything we wanted. Great performance, very comfortable, good fuel economy and of course being a Volvo very safe.  After a month of ownership, well the negative is of course the back seat, if you are traveling with friends make sure the don't have legs, on the other hand if your like us and don't have to worry about people in the back seat then this is a car to look at.  On the highway it is a fantastic cruiser, ranking right up there with my 500E.  In short, test drive it, you may well be shocked."
volvo,s60,2007,John, 12/04/2006,Daughter's Volvo,5,"My daughter was in a serious accident in my 2003 S-60. She was hit from behind by a truck while at a red light. The car was totaled she was fine. I leased a 2007 the next day and found it better than the 03, The turbo is very peppy the handling on the awd is excellent and the dtsc is great in wet weather. I would highly recommend this car. Fuel mileage is also very good on regular gas."
volvo,s60,2007,Drives-A-Lot, 12/02/2008,Been driving this car for 17 months,5,"I have been driving my S60 AWD since July of 2007. I drive from northern New England to New York City and back every other week. This car has held up well. My fuel economy seems fine (I don't pay very close attention). The comfort of the seats has remained solid, the electronics still work fine, in short, everything is still in working order. It has handled very well in snow/sleet conditions, though I recommend engaging the W option when doing so. The trunk storage is pretty good, the rear seats, while comfortable, don't have a boatload of legroom for adults. When I got this I was considering the BMW 3 Series, the S60 and the Saab 9-3. I am still very happy I decided to get the S60. "
volvo,s60,2007,cwkim, 05/17/2010,Very solid entry level sedan,4,"I recently purchased this vehicle as preowned and after reviewing other consumer reports and reviews, and I am very pleased with it so far.  I agree with what other people have noted and it seems pretty accurate far as performance and drivability goes for most drivers like me ( everyday commute for BASIC entry level luxury sedan). It has very nice standard features as noted in specs and does seem utilitarian overall and not as sophisticated as a BMW or Lexus but it seems more functional and solid.  I would highly recommend it for someone with kids or someone looking for value in a sedan with good standard features and known for safety. "
volvo,s60,2007,Relmid, 10/28/2006,Great R,4,"Wonderful driving experience.  Compared it against the Acura TL, BMW 3 series, hands down the Volvo is the car to own."
volvo,s60,2007,cwlgal, 01/05/2007,2007 S60 T5,4,"This car is sneaky fast.  Passing on the interstate seems lethargic until  you realize you're going 80 - 90 MPH.  The day after I bought it I drove 2000 miles round trip from Augusta, GA to Houston, TX and obtained an overall 29 MPG.  Volvo recalibrated the engine computer so the car runs on regular gas. I'm pleased to report there are no rattles and very little wind noise.  It seems solid and has very comfortable seats but has a somewhat harsh ride.  The turn radius will drive you crazy, especially in mall parking lots.  Overall nice car but I'm seriously disappointed in Volvo's depreciation rate, much higher than Japanese automobiles."
volvo,s60,2007,ExMB, 07/29/2010,Pleased So Far,4,"Just purchased this auto after turning in a leased Mercedes C300.  I loved that car so stepping down is going to be a bummer.  However, I am pleased thus far about the Volvo.  Good ride, though not sporty at all, and quality seats help it.  I like the safety record and the reliability prospects for the car."
volvo,s60,2007,Revolvolution, 03/29/2007,"3 years, 45000 miles",4,"We bought this car in 2005, the first year the R was available. After much research it came down to the Audi A4, BMW 3 series, Mercedes C Class and the Volvo S60R. After a test drive in each the Volvo was the clear winner. Faster pickup, more solid build quality. The BMW and MBenz felt like toys compared to this. The Audi was nice but had now where near the OOMPH! AWD was a must for us living in the Northeast. We have driven it over 45,000 miles now in the city and highway with no major mechanical issues. This is the 2nd one we owned (yes, I was the first person in the United States to total an ""R""). Major rollover accident. WE ALL WALKED AWAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH! Volvo saved my life. "

Once you get on the road its great there is some road noise but its also an older small car. Idle is basically silent and the engine sounds amazing. Mine has the upgraded dolby pro logic 2 sound system and its very loud with great quality but the bass just isnt there, the speakers are very capable the settings just wont let u crank the bass. One thing is when you drive really slowly (parking) and its just warming up it shakes and rattles alot. My t5 averages around 24 mixed driving. most of all you fall in love with this car and you cant say that about and Japanese or German rival.

volvo,s60,2007,Christian, 04/19/2016,150k miles and counting!!,5,"I bought my 2007 Volvo S60 R used at 85k miles. It now has over 150k miles on it! In this time I have not had one problem with the car. It's given a scheduled oil change every 5k miles, and had its 120k mile regular maintenance. I do take very good care of my car, however, I enjoy having fun in it as well. With the DTSC system combined with AWD, the back country roads couldn't be more fun. This was my first car, and have had it since I was 16, so I'm sure you can guess the limits I've pushed this car to... None the less, it has held up better than I could've imagined. I recently took the car for a full 130 point inspection and it passed every single one. My mechanic doesn't doubt if I'll see 300k miles with this car. With all the good, I will have to complain about the turn radius, as it's about the same as truck. All in all it's a great car, I look forward to the life of this car and the other Volvos' I will be purchasing.

I traded my 2006 BMW M3 convertible, 6 speed manual, for a 2007 Volvo S60 R, automatic. The S60 R is my favorite vehicle ever!"
volvo,s60,2007,suzanne G, 11/19/2006,I love my S60 2.5T,4,I love this car!  It has all the class and safety of a volvo but it is also very quick and sporty.  I have the black sapphire with black interior with the sport package.  
volvo,s60,2007,Ybba, 03/22/2008,"So far, still good.",5,"It's been a year and I'm even more impressed and pleased with my purchase.  Went on a couple of road trips from MA to VA on I95, through major cities like Stanford, NYC, DC, Richmond.  31MPG - Impressive.  The comfort of the driving position is wonderful.  I am reminded of the line from a competitor ""... when you turn your car on, does it return the favor?""  In this case a  resounding yes! Climate, seating, interior quality, reliability - all excellent.  Engine purrs at night. Had two service visits and the only thing changed were indicator bulbs. 1 year and 16000 miles later I am happy with my choice."
volvo,s60,2007,Mase, 12/23/2008,"Great Car, Very Comfortable",4,"The seats in this car are extremely comfortable. The layout of the dash is very user friendly and ergonomic. The heated seats were excellent. The sound system (HU650) sounds superb. Few parts are flimsy. Rattles too much. Could be a smoother ride. Very quite. Too much curb weight when taking corners. Very fast car. Slow at first, but once at about 35 mph, this car accelerates very smoothly. The turbo is amazing. Makes passing cars on the highway a pleasure. Extremely comfortably ride at 70+ mph. Excellent car, could handle just a bit better. "
volvo,s60,2007,veiles71@gmail.com, 11/23/2017,A little troublesome but a great value used.,3,"Purchased in 2016 with 58,000 miles for only $5,000. Cosmetically in very good condition. Ride on the highway is excellent and gas mileage at around 30 MPG is acceptable. However, in town, the car is very cumbersome with a heavy feel and a terrible turn radius making it difficult to park in tight spots. In the year that I have owned it, 2 rear light bulbs and one of the headlight bulbs have gone out. The headlight bulb cost $150 at the dealer and would have cost me then again as much if I had not installed it myself. The coolant level light has gone on 4 times so I'm losing coolant. Since I only drive such that the level is down every 2 months, I have not looked into getting it repaired. The check engine light came on and the code indicated a failed fuel system emissions pump failing. When I checked with the dealership, they told me they would have to diagnose it again at a cost of $130. When I explained to them that after checking on the internet I found that this was a common problem and was due to issues with the software and that there should be an extended warranty covering the software update. Was told my car was out of warranty by 2 months even though the mileage was only half the limit. Went back on the internet and discovered that Volvo offers a free software update that covers all issues. Called the local dealer and after convincing them that I do not have to have any ""service"" done to qualify for the software upgrade, finally had it done. No issues with the check engine light since. Overall, I see why the resale value is so low. Having said that, the S60 is a lot of car for price and I'd buy a used one again. Probably not a new one, though.

volvo,s60,2007,Tom, 04/26/2009,Company S60 II,3,"My company provided me this S60. If it were my money, I would not buy one. It is a fine highway car with wonderful straight-line acceleration and a comfortable driver's seat. The S60 is not good on curves and in corners -- its weight and vague steering adversely influence the handling and do not inspire confidence. After 29,350 miles, the only problems I have had are a loose passenger side door seal, fixed during an oil change service, and a rattle that I cannot locate by the passenger door frame.  Passenger seat is awkwardly oriented and uncomfortable on long trips  seems to place passenger at an angle within the car."
volvo,s60,2007,juniorCBR, 10/23/2006,Priceless,5,"Amazing car!  Incredibly quick, amazing exterior and interior looks, amazing sound system, gages are beautiful, powerful brakes, sharp rims, soft and easy clutch, AWD system definitely keeps the car grounded. An huge bargain for its price compared to its counterparts.  Definitely go overseas delivery if you have the chance, nothing beats zipping by BMW's on the autobahn."
volvo,s60,2007,Kenneth Bunch, 10/07/2006,Surprisingly FUN!,4,"Initially, I got the car b/c I could not pass up the great lease deal.  This car has great pickup for a 200 HP engine, is very roomy and comfortable. It has a firm drive and is has very responsive handling. Interior lags behing Lexus but is respectable.  6 airbags in the car is a plus."
volvo,s60,2007,Zach, 03/14/2007,I'm spoiled for ordinary cars,5,"This car is lightning fast, stable, and comfortable on long drives. The best of both worlds in terms of a sports car with coupe lines that you can live with and bring along friends. Great stereo, phenomenal seats - this car fits me better than anything else I have ever driven."
volvo,s60,2007,S60R, 09/01/2007,no reason to panic,4,"I've had my R for about 6 months and couldn't be happier.  I was a little nervous after reading some of the edmunds reviews, but can honestly say I have been thrilled thusfar.  I got mine with the sport package.  I, like many was looking at the IS350 and the GS.  This is a hoot to drive, not as throaty and braggadosia as the Infinit, and feels bigger inside (at least the front seat) than the lex."
volvo,s60,2007,J-Mac, 11/26/2007,Great Car!,5,I purchased my Volvo S60 T5 back in July. I couldn't be more happy with the car. The included features are excellent. It is a sporty sedan that is definitely fun to drive. You owe it to yourself to at least give it a test drive. I drove a half dozen cars when I was shopping around and the S60 was by far the nicest car for the price. 
volvo,s60,2007,Kent Lupino, 03/17/2017,'R' is a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,4,"I'd been looking for a P2 Volvo S60R for many months, and finally found a 2007 1-owner, low mileage example locally that I just couldn't pass up. I purchased it a little over a month ago and so far haven't regretted it at all. I should be clear that the 'R' moniker for the 2004-2007 S60 series vehicles indicated a very different kind car than all of the non-'R' variants. So if you are looking for a review of any S60 model that doesn't have the 'R' badge, you can stop reading and move on to the next review. A significantly re-worked 300HP 5-cylinder engine, sport exhaust, electronically-controlled suspension, Brembo performance disc brakes, and AWD give the S60R a completely different driving character than its siblings. It's quick, nimble, and produces an angry snarl--not too loud or thrashy-- when the tachometer goes over 2k RPM. In terms of styling, the P2 S60's are admittedly divisive. People seem to like it or hate it. I like it. Fortunately, Volvo didn't go overboard with plastic cladding and spoilers on the 'R' models, adding a slightly different front and rear fascia, subtle 'R' badge on the front black cube grille and rear trunk lid, and great-looking 17"" 5-spoke alloy wheels. I love the fact that other than the wheels, the car looks a lot like any other S60. It's a classic factory hot rod that looks like a 'sleeper'. The interior is also a step above other S60's, with premium leather sport seats that are amazingly comfortable, and classy real aluminum trim on the doors and center stack. The two things that I love most about the 'R' interior are the subtle contrasting blue stitching on the black areas of the door panels, handbrake, shifter boot, steering wheel, and dashboard and the metallic blue instrument dials. Classy! However, let's just say up front that the downside of the 'R' badge arrives with certain kinds of repair bills. Those 4-piston Brembo brakes are unique to the 'R', and definitely not cheap to replace. Neither is the big KKK turbocharger. Or the electronically-controlled struts. But if you take care of the car, those kinds of $$$ repairs don't come often. Now, I freely admit that the S60R is no BMW M3 in terms of overall performance, but I love it precisely because it's NOT a BMW M3. Nobody expects a pre-Polestar era Volvo to have a sporty character, but this one does, along with the safety and build quality that Volvo is famous for. But instead of flaunting that extra performance for everyone to see, it only reveals its superpower when called upon. Awesome.

volvo,s60,2007,happy 1st time owner, 04/29/2009,Fantastic used bargain!!,4,"Came across the S60 in Consumer Reports' ""best used cars""; they rate the 07 S60 reliability higher than Infiniti G35(!).   Found well-equipped one w/low miles for great price. Very pleased so far: it has sport package & ride can get a bit choppy over lateral ridges at times, but for the most part is pretty good, similar to 3-Series etc., very nice on hwy.  Expecting ride improvement when OEM junk Pirellis replaced.  Great solid build quality, nice amenities, front seats *very* comfortable; rear are as well but a bit cramped for tall folks, look @ S80 if you need more room.  Excellent radio & climate control.  Engine could be smoother, but has good torque.  Averaging 27 mpg on commute."
volvo,s60,2007,Ric, 09/24/2007,Excellent all-around street car,5,"The best value in an all-around performance street car.  Superb brakes.  Car feels noticeably lighter than it is when driven hard in the mountains or on the track.  More fun to drive with DTSC on because of active yaw control. Ignore most of the negative comments of some other reviewers.  The R *has* vented brake rotors, the gas cap is on the side of the car away from traffic so it's not ""wrong,"" there *is* a 6 CD changer option, turn the radio off for ""mute"" (duh), the key fob opens the trunk if you press the trunk button *twice* like it says in the manual (bad design, but it's right there in the book), and if you unlock the doors the trunk opens with the touch of a button."
volvo,s60,2007,JCSTOCKMAN, 03/30/2007,New S60 R,4,"My new S60 R is a pleasant surprise from a company known more for safety than performance.  With 300+ hp this car really moves and with AWD I have the confidence to push it farther than I might otherwise.  I originally was looking for a mid/large sedan like the Charger R/T, Impala SS, Maxima, and Mazdaspeed6.  After driving all these vehicles it was clear the Volvo was in a different class and was exactly what I was looking for."
volvo,s60,2007,Bob R., 11/08/2007,Fun car,4,Purchased the car with 1500 miles on it in September. Impressed with the comfort of the front seats although the back seat legroom can be a bit tight for those over six feet. Instrumentation is handy and functional. The car responds well in passing situations and seems to hug the road with no problems. No rattles or shakes noted to date. The design of the car is sporty w/o being presumptuous. I enjoy the fact the the car is not as common as the BMW and Lexus. 
volvo,s60,2007,Converted, 12/06/2006,R-Fegnugen (if only that were Swedish),4,"Exceptional. Fun car but not an ostentatious sports car.  Compared to Infiniti G35, Audi S4, and BMW 330.  Surprising power.  Tight handling with the advantage of variable All-Wheel Drive.  No problems with the R in mountain snow.  Get this w/ a manual transmission for maximum fun.  Great finishing touches on interior, gauges and electronics.  Hwy fuel economy better than 30 MPG.  Overall, good value for performance.  "
volvo,s60,2007,Richie T, 02/02/2016,S60 2.5T Hasn't Failed yet!!,3,"Lower MPG than 04 V70 2.5t wagon....though it improved a bit with new tires.  Had it about 2 years and it's very comfortable in the front seats.   Just doesn't drive as smoothly as the older wagon.

volvo,s60,2007,bclass, 08/13/2012,What a piece of crap,3,"Bought it used at 53,000mi radiator crapped after 3 weeks. Power locks and power seats are dying. Failed inspection due to axel rod. Check engine light came on at 58,000. Than the coolant level dropped to zero and had to shut car off to prevent engine damage. Now trying to trade it on anything Japanese."

volvo,s60,2007,Dennis, 07/01/2010,Last Volvo Ever,2,"The gas filler cap leaked on the car since the first full tank of gas.Service simply stated that they could not duplicate the problem so that is where we stand. Seat belt locks, so it is sometimes impossible to lean forward to see oncoming traffic. The overall quality and value leave a lot to be desired. I wish I would have kept my Infiniti, it would have been seven years old now but it was a much better car."
volvo,s60,2007,arbitrage, 09/08/2006,Surprise Vehicle,4,"The new Volvo S60 2.5T is a terrific vehicle.  I have owned Audi 6 and Lincloln LS prior to this and have found the Volvo to be: more comfortable, better pick-up, interior design to be well built and the leather sport seats are most comfortable of any car ever driven; the exterior lines rival the Audi A 6!  The only negative found is in the turning radius; otherwise this car combines significantly better safety, terrific seats and exterior design as well as any competitively priced and/or higher priced autos."
volvo,s60,2007,Florida, 01/30/2008,Leftover 2007,4,"I walked into the dealership to purchase a 2008 V40T5 and found none available in the South Florida area.  I was called back to see this car, a loaner/demo with the Premium and Sport packages.  One test drive later I was an owner.  Over the years I have owned every premium brand,and this is a great blend for the money."
volvo,s60,2007,Mike, 02/28/2007,Having Fun in the Sun!,5,"What a ride - beating out the Lexus IS 250, Acura TL and BMW 3 series, this is the best car if you want a flexible car - fun when it needs to be and luxurious when you want it to be. Added spoiler, Premium Package and Sport Package makes for a very sleek looking and luxuriously appointed car. Many positive comments about the interior and exterior fit and finish. Geartronic transmission a nice feature - like other posters I thought that the pedal response was a bit slow on the highway, before I realized I was doing close to 90 mph! Excellent pickup under 40 mph, consistently. It moves with any pedal pressure - immediate response. Very satisfied buyer!"
volvo,s60,2007,Ybba, 03/15/2007,So far so good...,5,"Just got into this vehicle after much research (1 yr).  It came down to S60 vs. TL.  S60 won because of cabin comfort (incredible!), fold flat rear seats, 8-way passenger seating, hand-brake location (driver side), Regular fuel & Trunk capacity.  Overall I'm very satisfied with the ride.  Makes you feel like driving all day... It's been 14 years since I've driven a new car (came from a 93 Integra which is the best car in the world!!!).   It's going to take some time getting use to all this new technology.  Will keep you posted..."
volvo,s60,2007,Tom, 02/17/2007,Do Not Purchase This Car,1,"I am shocked that this vehicle is allowed to be sold after so many service related issues.  My transmission has gone out, the shocks have gone out, the wheel bearings have gone out, the engine needs oil every 800 miles.  I have driven a loaner more than this car.  Volvo is very unresponsive probably because they are owned by FORD."
volvo,s60,2007,WPBFLA9, 10/20/2006,Bad transmission after 2000 miles,2,"My transmission conked out after 2,000 miles. I have not yet received any explanation or a repair. I am disgusted with the car and with Volvo. Also, the handling on my old VW Passat is Much better."
volvo,s60,2007,Len, 02/05/2007,Defective Shocks,4,"Car was delivered with 2 defective rear shocks, Dealer could not replace them because they are on national backorder. After a month they received replacement units they were installed, Brought car back to dealer. The replacements were also defective"
volvo,s60,2007,blawdog, 08/05/2007,So far so Good,5,Sports package really makes a difference. I test drove a premium without the sport upgrade and was disappointed. When mine arrived on the back of a carrier with 2.7 miles and a surprise sports package I was delighted.
volvo,s60,2008,Stravage, 09/28/2008,1st Impression,3,"In the past 2 years I have gone from a jeep grand Cherokee to a Nissan Sentra to my Volvo S60. Wife and myself sat in the S40 just looked at each other and  knew that we didnt want another small car, took the s60 out for a test drive and we were hooked. It was love at first sight. Within 3 hours we drove the machine home. This is not a car, its a driving machine. Of course that coming out of a Nissan that dragged you down the road while the S60 gives you a ride on the road. It was late and the s60 tank was on empty, stopped for gas 3.65 a gal it took $44 to fill the tank. Now I remember why I bought the Nissan. Driving it home we were all smiles."
volvo,s60,2008,aikiman, 08/29/2010,First Volvo,4,"This is my first Volvo, had an Acura and Maxima before this.  I've had this car for approx 18 mos, bought it used with 9500 miles and love it.  It is built very tight and feels heavier than it is.  The turbo gives it a lot of power when merging or trying to pass. Highway driving is excellent, it definitely loves to cruise. The back seat is tight, I have  an 8 year old and 10 year old and I have to move the passenger seat and my seat forward for them.  Quality so far is fine,front headlight washers needed new motors and the computer has had to be updated once because the immobilizer would occasionally get triggered preventing it from starting.  Problem fixed but it still does it sometimes."
volvo,s60,2008,2xvolvoowner, 05/16/2012,Double trouble,3,"We own both the XC90 and S60and have been frustrated with both vehicles.
Both have seen more than their fair share of the service department and the lack of concern from Volvo has been discouraging.
In two years of the S60, we have had to replace the ignition switches twice. The emergency cable never really engaged properly so it had to be adjusted as well as the sunroof at a cost. A faulty ABS contact reeel and front axle shaft had to be replaced due to recalls. The headlight washer fell off and had to be replaced twice. As if we didnt feel nickeled and dimed already, we now have to replace the Fire Trap Housing not covered on the warranty. We are very disappointed."
volvo,s60,2008,smartgriz, 06/11/2008,S60 S is for super fast,4,"This is the fastest car I have driven. Out of the whole its a bit tnetative but the turbo takes it to the moon. Passing cars on the highway is a kick and shooting the mountain passes is like driving grand prix. Only real downsides are rear seat has very little room (kids only) and the fuel economy is not that great, 25mpg at 75 on highway, 22 at 90."
volvo,s60,2008,lordway, 11/21/2008,Relability Stinks,1,"I liked this car a lot when I first bought it. Now I regret my purchase. It's too small for a normal sized person and forget about fitting anyone in the back seat. It's too small for even a child. The trunk space is not practical. It's not a true sport sedan and the gas mileage is poor considering its size and that it has only 5 cylinders. Furthermore, the relability is suspect. It has been to the dealership 4 times in 4 months for two intermitent problems (antilock brakes and the radio). No resolution for the second problem yet. The dealer has not been able to fix the problem without keeping the car for a week at a time. Bottom line: Don't make my mistake, buy Japanese.     "
volvo,s60,2008,Central Florida, 05/09/2009,My first Volvo,5,I've had my Volvo 10 months and love it! I traded in my SUV in order to save on gas.  I have not had any problems and I get better gas mileage than I thought I would --- about 35 Hwy as long as I drive 69mph. Very very happy overall!
volvo,s60,2008,4th volvo, 01/15/2008,Will absence make my heart grow fonder?,4,"This is my fourth Volvo, so I guess I am brand loyal.  The AWD is awesome.  The car is heavier than my last T5 S60, although inside it is almost identical. The drive is powerful, and the acceleration with the geartronic transmission makes the car very fun to drive.  The leather, stereo, etc., is just enough luxury for me.  Sad to say I haven't had it 2 full months and it will be in the shop already because the temperature gauge does not work and the fan will not stop.  Car currently sounds like a jet plane after starting it."
volvo,s60,2008,Mc Mom , 11/01/2007,Not a minivan - thank goodness,4,"This car is fun to drive and is just beautiful to look at. It's great for driving kids around, but even more fun when you get to drive it on your own. No one will ever suspect this is Mom's Taxi. This is no minivan, but has lots of room for 5 and a huge trunk. I never thought I would drive a Volvo, but my T5 is just awesome."
volvo,s60,2008,JimeeWho, 05/03/2008,Raider,4,"Second Volvo, sporty fun, acceleration is not fast off-the-line, but watch out when turbo kicks in. This vehicle gets-it at 40 to 90mph. Performance it's there. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a Lexus, but who wants that? That's for mom and grandma."
volvo,s60,2008,CUx2, 11/05/2019,Reliable Volvo x60,5,"We bought our s60 from a former dealership manager who now buys good cars at auction for clients.  Ours was 1 year old and so gently used, it still looked new.  Truly, we have changed oil, air filter and tires and that's about it.  It is our 5th volvo (6th for our family) and we just keep coming back to the Volvo for reliability.  We even know folks with really old Volvo's with 250,000+ miles and still going.  Ours had aged incredibly well and we are happy with it.

volvo,s60,2009,gorj, 11/22/2011,An Expensive Ride,3,"I am a Volvo owner since 1967.
Being a mechanic, I have performed most of the non-warranty work on the Volvo myself. My experience has been that most Volvo dealers are way too expensive for both parts and labor. Sometimes they tend to find issues with your Volvo that never existed before you took it in. They also often do not repair what you asked them to repair. Recently I ordered a new key and remote for my 2009 Volvo, which was missing one of the two when I purchased it.
The key and remote were about $300. 
The Volvo dealer wanted another $295 to program it.
I am outraged that for just a key and a remote I will be out almost $600. This may be my last Volvo!!"
volvo,s60,2009,PPL, 11/04/2017,Solid and safe but instruments too touchy,3,"Repairs are very costly. I bought my used car at 79K and put over 24K miles in less than 2 years. Every other month something major needed repairing. Things that I never ever had to repair on a 2001 Honda Accord EX which I put over 240K miles. Things like the throttle, system tire service, two front wheel well, anything to do with suspension is not covered after factory warranty even is you buy additional warranty from the dealership.  I spent more in less than 2 years on my S60 than I've ever have on my Accord.  The difference, I bought my Accord brand new and all the miles i put on it were mine and I took very good care of my Accord so I definitely got my money's worth.  Because the previous miles on the Volvo were not mine, I can only suspect that drove it rough and did not take great care of the car.  OR it is just a car that needs LOTS of ATTENTION and REPAIRS.  I will NEVER buy another Volvo because it is too expensive for repairs and not very reliable. This would be winter number 2 for my Volvo and I'm not expecting much. Just be warned of costly repairs and poor handling due to poor suspension and handling.
"
volvo,s60,2009,marcy,ny,nice sports sedan and a deal on the 2009,4,"This s60 is like a sports sedan, not luxary. The 2.5 turbo is great. The front seats like sitting in a cockpit. I owned a 2002 passat, 2006 passat, 2008 Nissan maxima. The max ride was better,  but this car is easier to drive, more like the passats but better. I just $9000. Off on the s60. As they are clearing them out for a redesign. These cars are a bit overpriced normally I wouldnt look at this make but with this money off was a better deal than the new maxima. Classy little sedan."
volvo,s60,2009,Ken, 12/11/2015,Disappointed,2,"My first Volvo was a used 1999 s-70, great car, loved it. This 2009is very poor in comparison, the front seats have no comfort, it rides like a log wagon. The headlights are impossible to change the bulbs, and when I did the wires on the plug are shot. If this is what volvo has come to in 10 years, I want no part of another one.
"
volvo,s60,2009,Jeanie, 07/03/2010,A great buy!,4,"I have always driven large suvs (suburban, escalade, Tahoe), but with my new position I needed something to be driving out of town frequently (prev drove Accord, Avalon cts for work travel). I looked at the c class Benz, BMW, Cadillac. But the safety ratings & Volvo service are irreplaceable. The fact that there are no luxury dealerships in my town means that whatever I bought had to have great service & road side assist. I love this car! I wish I could have waited for the new model, but got a terrific deal on this one. You cannot beat Volvo quality no matter how serene & sedate you feel the styling is. Once you drive one & ride in one you are hooked! "
volvo,s60,2009,Choc, 02/14/2009,Solid Ride.,5,"This is my second car from Sweden. I love the exterior styling, it's beautiful but not flashy. The car drives very good, you have the press the gas paddle a little more than other cars but I guess they made it that way for safety. Volvo did a good job on the interior fit and finish. Although the dash is a little last century on the look, but all the bottoms are well laid out and easy to use. Good mileage per gallon thanks to the turbo.  "
volvo,s60,2009,PeterJax, 07/19/2009,IKEA on wheels,4,"My first Volvo.  It looks nice in an IKEA sort of way...some like it, others don't.  Seats are very comfortable.  Silver metallic paint finish is amazing.  Body feels sturdy.  Interior controls at first seem strange but you later realize that they are well thought out.  Good fuel economy for a car that weighs this much, yet the turbo gives it kick when you need it.  Good overall drive, nice mix of sport and luxury."
volvo,s60,2009,happy, 08/06/2009,"First, But Not Last Volvo",5,"Extremely happy with the 2009 Volvo S60 AWD Special Edition. Great factory incentives (i.e. 5 year 60K warantee and free maintenance for a year, plus all the cash back) made this a no- brainer. Far cheaper than the BMW 328, the Mercedes C-300, etc, but with a far greater safety record, better MPG, better warranty, and FREE maintenance for 5 years! Louvering Volvo was a great dealership with no hassles or pressure, and provides free annual detailing for the life of the car. Plenty of acceleration and the 5 speed tranny keeps the RPMs low, saving gas. Would recommend both the car and the dealership to anyone in the market for a new or used car.  "
volvo,s60,2009,Jeremy, 08/07/2009,My first Volvo. Love it!!!,4,I really really like this car.  My last car was a 2007 Camry.  I test drove some BMW's and Benz's and liked this better.  It is pretty quick and easy to drive.  It can go pretty fast when you need it to.  I have gotten so many compliments on it too.  The engine sounds really good and you gett all the torque from 1500-4500 rpm's.
volvo,s60,2009,Chris, 08/17/2009,Great bang for the buck,4,"I've looked at the S60's since they came out years ago...but always thought they were overpriced in the market they competed in. However, with the recent clearance reductions, maintenance and warranty incentives...I couldn't help myself...and couldn't be happier. Probably doesn't compete well with the BMW's, Lexus, and Infiniti in it's original price range...but against the Accord and Camry with similar features, I think it stands head and shoulders above. To me, has a much more high-end feel ride. Gas mileage for me runs about 24 in combined driving, or regular unleaded."

Then I went to Gothenburg to pick the car up in late Oct 2010 as part of the Overseas Delivery Program. 

I was blown away by the entire deal: great Swedish hospitality and the truly satisfying factory delivery center experience. Due to timing, I could not drive it around Europe, but was more anxious to have it shipped back to the US! 

I received it in December, just before Christmas :)

To summarise the S60: It is a pure engineering marvel, that blends sportiness and safety in one outstanding package!"

All of these systems have worked flawlessly since 2011. So what's not to like in a car with super comfortable seats, a rear entertainment system, and 300 hp on regular gas? Well, the trunk could have been bigger and space for a temporary spare designed into the floor of the trunk. Oh, and a heated steering wheel would have been nice.

The engine acceleration power,sound and smoothness was almost enough to sill the deal, but I had to see how it handled. The car is not as low to the ground but the rear torque vectoring offsets it enough to satisfactory overcome the height and front end weight on this 6 cylinder Porsche sounding (yes I just said that) engine to corner sharply. The brakes are just perfect in my opinion. They are not the in your face ""right now"" kind of brakes but do an admirable job without feeling taxed."

I'm a long-time BMW owner and would never have thought I'd like an S60, but I was immediately impressed by the combination of comfort, performance, build quality, and classy interior. This is a front-wheel biased vehicle and it will never quite have the handling edge of a RWD car like a 335i, but Volvo found an excellent balance between comfort and performance. The S60 is a more comfortable highway ride with enough power and handling to keep it interesting to drive. I like that this car is HIGHLY configurable to individual driving style and the different settings actually work."
volvo,s60,2012,T Nowlin, 07/13/2015,Bought back by dealer for major warranty issues,3,"Update: 
The vehicle was bought back by Volvo under the CPO warranty at approximately 67,000 miles because of the concerning oil consumption issue they could not resolve after many visits and about six weeks with my car sitting at the shop waiting for a backordered replacement engine. After much consideration, I replaced the vehicle with an equivalent 2014 model, which is the first year of a minor design refresh. This model has been considerably more reliable in all respects. I cannot recommend the 2012 based on the numerous quality issues and the oil consumption problem that was specific to very early second-generation S60s. 

Original review: 
I have owned nothing but Volvos. That said, I'm a bit of a car guy and know the comparisons between my 2012 S60 T5 and its competitors. While it may not handle as tightly as a comparable Mercedes or BMW, a T5 beats a base 3-series or C-Class hands-down when it comes to speed and comfort. It's also a sharp-looking car. My primary motivation for purchasing this vehicle was because it was the second safest car ever tested by the IIHS (next to the Tesla Model S) at the time. I bought it certified pre-owned from a Volvo dealer with about 30,000 miles in 2014. It has the premium package (sunroof, leather, power passenger seat) and climate package (heated seats, headlight washers, rain-sensing wipers). The draw to the CPO car was the 100,000-mile/7-year drivetrain warranty. While I adore this car, I am also very, very glad I have the extended warranty. I don't think I've ever had to take a car into the shop so often. At the time I'm writing this, I have taken the car in four times to fix a leak in the passenger floorboard that they cannot identify (I will give the dealer credit for their exhaustive efforts with this). The silver trim on the steering wheel and console began to peel, which they replaced. They also replaced a broken air vent. One leather panel on the backseat has begun to flake while the ones beside of it have not. It's obvious to me that the tiny panel in the middle is made of inferior material to those surrounding it. The dealer would not address this because they ""found evidence"" that my dog had ridden in the backseat. Most problematic is that the oil pressure warning came on 4,000 miles after my most recent service, meaning that it was four (of five) quarts low. It goes in later this week to have that issue figured out. I maintain this car well, having my services done when (or before) they're due, and only use synthetic oil. It shouldn't be having these problems. But most importantly to me, I'm safe, comfortable, have the power to escape a treacherous situation, and look damn good doing it. But, of course, it is as I'm on my way to the dealership for the millionth time for warranty work.

It is simply more car for less money. Excellent pickup on the freeway, deft steering, nimble handling. Before buying we also test drove the T6, which was AWESOME, but more car than we needed. The T5 is so much fun to drive and so well-built that I have a feeling our enthusiasm will last long after our last car payment. If you are considering a BMW, Lexus, or the like, you MUST test drive this car. Gone are the days of the stodgy Volvo. This car positively rocks!"

After owning our S60 for 3.5 years and putting 62,000 miles on the vehicle, we noticed that the vehicle was burning oil between oil changes (1.5-2.0 quarts). The cars warranty expired at 50,000 miles. I contacted Volvo North America and explained the issue to them. They had the local dealership contact me and setup an appointment to look at the car. After looking at the vehicle the dealer said that the piston rings were bad, and replaced them under warranty. The cost of this repair is $3,500-$4,000. How many other car companies would cover this after the warranty expired?

I have the T5 version and it is quiet, very responsive, and gets good gas mileage on regular gas (mine got 32MPG highway on a recent trip). Driving it is a dream. On the outside its a great looking car, but not overstated, the interior is comfortable and elegant. Materials and fit and finish are excellent. When you look at when you get for the price, and then add in the 5yr/50000 mile warranty, which includes wear and tear items and regularly scheduled maintenance, it's just fantastic."

I noticed it started using oil. I was told that this was normal with turbo. This became worse as time went on. Finally, I called the dealer & they agreed to see it even though by now I was out of warranty. The dealership acted oblivious to what could be going on. I told them that I had found in my research that this is an issue that others are having & Volvo is aware of it. They acted like it was with the t6 models & that this issue wasn't with the t5 model. They agreed to do an oil consumption test. I was told to come back in 3000 miles so they could check the oil level. I told them I wouldn't have any oil! They told me not to add oil, they needed to see it. I kept an eye on my oil level. Took it back at 2000 miles & it was barely on the dipstick. I also had the TSB in hand that I had gotten from a local shop. They said it did indeed include my car! I tried to show the dealership but they said they had it. They told me they were giving me a loaner for free. Although they charged me $150, supposedly for tax!? It has been 7 days! My car is still sitting untouched. I was told that they were waiting to hear from their territory rep or whomever. I got them all my oil change receipts, except 2 which I can't find but are written down in my planner. Volvo had the car a total of 14 times. Be careful buying this car. I don't want anyone else to be having the issues that I am having. I have a good looking car that has a bad engine! This should not be happening! I sure expected more out of Volvo.

Volvo has really stepped out their comfort zone with s60. I love how fresh and futuristic S60 looks but it still feels safe, comfortable and durable. The most amazing thing is how smooth the ride is.

volvo,s60,2012,Mike Rainone, 06/12/2019,"OMG, the most perfect car ever!",5,"We picked Borky up in Gothenburg in the fall of 2012 and have put 183,000 miles on it with one set of front brakes only, and a minor hassle with poor acceleration from our mechanic putting non-iridium plug in it. Once the plugs were replace with OEM Volvo plugs it ran as always, like a watch. It will out run many BMWs and is amazingly stable on the road. The ONLY complaint is that given the stiff suspension and the low profile tires it goes through tires like a banshee. I have tried every tire from Michelin to the low end Chinese brands and it seems to make no difference, so I have given up and get the cheapest Z rated tires with a 40K warranty. Here is the kicker: I probably won't buy another new Volvo, but if I do, it will only because we would like to do another European delivery. I don't like the 4 cylinder engines, and the reports suggest that as expected, too much work is being done from too small of a displacement over the long hall especially with the high boost that they are using. So, the reason I am on this site is that I am going to buy another early version (up to 2104) S 60 R Design, 
but I intend to keep and  blueprint Borky as well when he breaks (which he may never do!)

Update. The S60 R-Design is still running great, at 192,000 miles, the only change is that we have signed up to buy a V90 using European Delivery in the spring. We test drove the 2019 model V90 R-design and I must admit the thing accelerates like a bat out of hell. I still worry about the amount of work the 4 cylinder is doing, but it is my wife's car and she does not abuse a car like I do. We have a 2009 2.5 S60 that she drive and it has 160,000 miles and still run perfectly so I am fairly sure the V90 will last a long time. 

To this day, I cannot understand why more people don't do the European Delivery program. Perhaps they are afraid of driving in Europe, but given the price reduction +/- 7%, the free airline tickets to and from Europe, the fact that everything is taken care of for you, it is silly not to do this.

Could handle a little better at the limits, but dynamic suspension and/or AWD might address that for those that are concerned. This car is as comfortable and powerful as my Aero, with loads of tech, and personality. Black on black. I am very satisfied so far, and enjoy every drive. More interior room that 3 series or A4.

The car has 160,000 miles on it now and i can honestly say ive never had to repair anything and thats with me being forgetful and once going 14,000 miles without an oil change... ooops! My volvo dealer has been very helpful and i have faith this car will outlive my sons honda accord. I will 100% be buying another volvo.

volvo,s60,2012,Steve kahle, 10/22/2016,2012 Volvo S60 T5 (totaled),5,"Bought used with 40000 miles on it in fall of 2015. Have had no issues with. Oil changed every 5000 miles. Its safe, fun and sporty to drive. Tight steering. Seats are very comfortable. Backup camera comes in very handy. Very solid doors, trunk and hood. I would recommend this car. My car before this was a Saab. I enjoyed my Saab very much but this. Volvo beats it hands down !

The Volvo was totaled. T-boned passenger side by a driver that ran a red light. She was driving a Impala. In never saw it coming. Airbags and safety features kept me from getting hurt or killed. I also had my seat belt on. Thanks Volvo!

volvo,s60,2012,thinkwendy, 07/09/2013,No more SAAB stories.,4,"I was involved in an accident with my 2006 SAAB 9.3 2.0 turbo in April returning from Spring Break.
I was very lucky... I was going 70 MPH and a box truck had pulled over for the night, but did not pull all the way off the driving lanes.
 I was the third car to hit debris in the right driving lane and unfortunately my car was totaled.
I had very minor injuries and witnessed some major injuries of the two vehicles that crashed before me.
I went searching for a new vehicle and my mind was made up that I was going to get an SUV or crossover, but my heart did no race like it did when I was in my SAAB.
I was spoiled and wanted luxury. I tea drove everything and fell in love with the VolvoS60"
volvo,s60,2012,Brian, 01/15/2018,2012 S60 T5 - Knocking my socks off,5,"I'll start off by saying I was not too familiar with Volvo. I knew of their existence but never did a double take. My company leases their vechicles to the employees as a company vehicle. Then when mileage hits 85-90k miles, they first offer it to the original driver of our company, then to any other employee in the company. I just happened to check the listings in Phoenix, AZ and the first one on the list was a 2012 Volvo S60 T5 Flamenco Metallic Red. Then I saw it was our branch manager. I walked over and asked him how he liked the car and said he loved it and threw me the keys and said ""see for yourself"". I was so excited once I sat in the amazing leather cockpit and slapped in the boxy key and hit start. He had a smile on his face as he walked away knowing I would probably enjoy the drive. The handling was great! The acceleration was great! Oh, then I noticed sport mode. That really helped me decide about the purchase. So after cranking the 8 speaker stereo with upgraded 160 watt amp, and opening and closing the sunroof / moonroof...I was hooked. I kinda said under my breathe...Volvo, for life. I have had the car now for about 1 month and I am still not tired of driving it. The controls in the console are easy to use. The power seats are a treat. The solid state hard drive I plugged in to the USB port in the center hidden console supplies me with 256GB of tunes that will last on any road trip without repeating a song. By the way, the first thing I did for maint was replace the headlights with a little whiter shades, replaced the spark plugs with double platinum. Replace the cabin filter (not fun at all). And polish up the leather seats for a nice new look. I did notice that the newer 2014-2016 speedometer cluster was easy to swap out but a few features would not show up so I decided to keep the old cluster and enjoy the simple yet semi-sporty look. I also did opt in on a very good deal for the 2 year extended warranty that covers major repairs.  Hoping to get a good 3 or 4 years from this beautiful piece of machinery.  Happy 2018!

volvo,s60,2012,Zach, 07/19/2019,DO NOT BUY,1,"Purchased this vehicle to drive a lot - always had volvo's always loved them. This car had its engine completely fail on me and had to be replaced for 8K after the non collision damage. I did research after the fact and the coils fail, the engine fails, and the pistons lose compression regularly around 140K miles which happened to me. PLEASE reconsider purchasing this car if you actually plan on driving 1-2K miles a month.

volvo,s60,2012,Not a Volvo fan any longer, 10/05/2019,Buy a Honda,1,"I bought my 2012 s60 in 2012. I have had nothing but problems. It burns oil. Volvo tried replacing the engine in 2014 and it still burns oil. Have to put in about 2 quarts between oil changes. I had to replace the whole a/c compressor in 2019 after it completely stopped working. This last week, my car just died at an intersection and mechanics are still trying to figure out what is wrong. These are just the major things which have happened and does not include how my back passenger door does not lock and many other issues.  Went and bought an Accord today as we wait to see if we can get the Volvo working and sold for whatever we may get for it. Very disappointed.  We do not have the money to always buy new cars and had hoped to get maybe 15 years out of this car and we didn’t even get 10. Update:  Had to sell the car as scraps and bought a Honda.

I sold Volvos and BMWs in Canada for 4 years and loved both brands. I have had my T6 R-Design for only 5 months and was a little concerned I might miss my Infiniti G37 Sport with manual transmission. The S60 is so much fun to drive, I haven't thought much about the G37. I liked what I saw and read when the S60 was redesigned and got seriously interested in the new R-Design. One test drive and I was sold. Only mistake I made was letting my wife use it for a short road trip. A week later we had traded in her Ford Edge on a stunning white/taupe interior Volvo C70 convertible. "

My husband thought I was crazy, as this became a weekly thing for me to go out and test drive something.
 After owning the first gen Lexus RX for 12 years, I felt like a kid in a candy store, with so many cool features to explore.
Since I was planning to keep the ute for bad weather and hauling stuff, I finally narrowed down my search to sporty 4 door cars. Almost bought a Volt. Then I almost bought a new 3 series.
And then I went all the way back to one of the very first cars I tested, in January 2011. I wound up with a gorgeous sapphire black S60-T5.

Prior to getting my ""wonderful"" 2013 S60 T5, Audi gave me a new 2013 A4 2.0 T (w) premium package to use for three days, while my A3 was being fixed.

Needing a new car & my recent experience with the A4, it gave me a good reference point/comparison to the S60. Anyway, for ""me/myself & I"", the Volvo S60 T5 was ""much better"" than the A4 for city and highway driving. Also, it handled very good (not as good as the Germans, but good enough) and provided better steering feel, a more solid feel/smoother ride, quieter cabin, better seats, and ""just enough"" power to have some fun."

But here I have a sporty four door that is billed as the safest sedan out there, plenty of pep and road feel, and after 8,000 miles I'm won over. Small squeaky belt issue, and mileage could be better (25 combined, 29 on highway) but the seats are SO comfy, and I like the sparse / not busy interior with smoother leather than you'll find on similarly priced cars. I wish I had a 2013 AWD, but for this price it's a lot of bang for your buck. I don't know why anyone would get an overpriced and dull Merc C instead of this (in regard to a previous S60 reviewer)."
volvo,s60,2012,kj83, 03/02/2013,Great Car!,5,"OK, so the other reviews describe the car well.
For those wondering how they hold up over time: my S60 T5 is nearly 2 years old (purchased May 2011), has about 24K miles on it, and has had no problems (OK, well, I did get the wiper blades replaced for free at my last routine service, and a firmware update before that). 

I bought this over a BMW 3 series, Audi A4, Infinity, etc, and that was a bit of a shocker as I only stopped into the Volvo dealer because it was on my way to another car dealer.
Good thing, as I was won over after many test drives, and I do love the car."

Unfortunately, the navigation system is useless. More often than not, it gets me lost and wants me to get off the highway then get back on for no reason. I've started using my Iphone GPS as a backup as I can't trust this. Also, the way the update to the navigation system is done is antiquated. After asking for over 6 months, I finally received the CD update that took over 6 hours to load while the car was running. This is 2014. There has to be a better way. Unfortunately, as long as Volvo does not improve their navigation system like Audi has, I will not buy another Volvo. "

Just like others people said, it drives, handles great and is has a comfortable ride.
I got about 550 miles on it so I haven't really got on the gas.

The engine is powerful, albeit a bit noisy when revved.
The suspension is not a sporty as the new ads for the S60 would make you believe, but it will satisfy most drivers.

I took the car back twice for the squeak and it was never found and the dealer wasn't really all that concerned.  I ended up buying a 2nd car to drive as the squeak has gotten worse and I can no longer drive the car.  I recently had to rent a car because I had passengers and didn't want them to hear this.  I paid more for this car than any car I've ever had.  I waited my adult life to have a car like this.  It is the greatest disappointment I could ask for.  I pay monthly for a car I can't drive without ear plugs.  I would expect this from a cheap car, not a Volvo.

28 mpg up and down hills from VA to WV. Didn't reset and after the WV back to PA run, we were back at 32 mpg. I, and my son with ipod, think the base sound system is fine. Excellent value compared to the A4, 328i, & 300C."

I was advised to look at the S60, but wasn't real interested. Well, out of respect, I did take a look. Indeed, I sat in its sumptuous leather seats then put the car through the paces. I was blown away. How had I never taken a close look at this car before now? Maybe the Volvo reputation for safety wasn't enough to catch my eye? Hmm. Whatever the case, I could not be more thrilled with my S60 T5. Luxurious, fun, fast, economical, and a badge that commands respect. I am now a Volvo fan. A BIG one. Absolutely love this car.

***UPDATE***
I now have 92,000 trouble-free miles on my S60 and I am pleased beyond words. It has exceeded my expectations in every way. I DO wish that mine had navigation and a back-up camera, but I bought it knowing that it didn't. Most surprising has been it's high speed performance. I travel often across the sparse and remote Alligator Alley. I have been known to open it up going across and holding speeds near 120 MPH. The S60 is smooth and confidence-inspiring at those speeds. Kudos to the Volvo engineers who designed it. Very well done.

The cars handling is OK but I'd prefer more rode feel but it was acceptable. Acceleration was good.

However, I did notice some fit and finish problems in the interior after a few days of driving. I went back to the dealer to point these out and they took pictures and sent them to Volvo. I bought the car in Feb. 2012 and it is June and the problems have not been resolved.

I've had mine for about 2 weeks.
This is the first time in about 30 years of purchasing cars that I've bought the same brand back-to-back. This car is a hit for Volvo. "
volvo,s60,2013,Brian, 03/31/2016,A solid workhorse in a field of sprinters,5,"Here's the deal, this car is a niche buy and tell you why. But first some background. My job is in the automotive electronics world, so working with car companies and design engineers is what I do 50 hours a week. What most engineers will tell you over dinner is that Volvo's have and do have the most solid design in the world. What that means is that they favor safety and long-term reliability over short-term aesthetics and performance. Here is where the problem begins. There are large segments of car buyers and this one fails to hit a big group. I'll get to that later. But here goes my personal review.

This is an awesome car, but I'll give my 3 small criticisms. 
1. The backseat. There are no 2 ways around this. The backseat is comfortable but insanely small. If you're over 5ft 8 inches, people will be uncomfortable sitting behind you. 
2. The instrument cluster/infotainment. The speedometer takes a little getting used to. I'd expect a digital one to be honest, but you don't get it here. Can't say why its off a little, but its a minor annoyance.
3. Front seats. This is really dependent on the person. I'm 6ft 5in, so I'm a big guy. This car has really nice, comfortable seats, but they sit low and the whole car has kind of a low profile. For the extra long trips, comfort is a bit of an issue. But this is really just a big person problem. My wife and brother in law have driven it long distances as normal sized people in great comfort.

Now the good. Where do I start. I have the AWD version and live in Minnesota, so you can do the math of how much fun you have when you mix a turbo with AWD in the snow. But that's not unique to this car. What is unique is the build itself. What you'll find when you drive european cars like this is that they just feel tight, from the suspension to the steering. But the S60 has an extra feeling of being just solid and that doesn't wear off. If you care to do so, just open the hood or go underneath it. I've done a little work myself and can tell you that they are meticulously well built and designed. There is a really rugged simplicity to them.  the car is sport, quick and responsive. Don't believe reviewers that tell you otherwise. Simply google the 0-60 and other tests, it performs well. 

This is where it begins to distance itself from the Audi's and BMWs. These Volvos are best bought by people that plan to own them for a while. the target market is someone who wants a nice European style sedan with Japanese reliability. I've only had to have on repair done and it was the electronic parking brake motor (under warranty). But I can tell you that the repair bills will be nowhere near that of its European cousins, but will be higher than an American or Japanese car. 

The bottom line is that no matter what you hear or are told by Audi fanboys and the like, the S60 is a better car if you care about long term reliability and affordability. You may get a little more short term spunk from the Audi and BMW counterparts, but the only other place you'll get more is the price tag and the repair bill. 

There has been a ton of market research on this point and there is a significant segment of the population that buys European cars in this price range. That segment is men, ages 25-40. The main reason they buy them is the name recognition and status. The problem for Volvo is that Audi, BMW and to some extent VW own this space almost completely. There are 2 companies trying to crack that market. Cadillac, with their ATS and Volvo with the S60. Both a failing for the most part. The reason is that they don't have 4 rings or a blue and white badge on the grill. 

Long review, but I feel this car deserves it. Don't fall victim to the popularity contest. In this class of cars, this is the smart person's choice.

volvo,s60,2013,smerdyakov, 03/19/2014,An outstanding sedan,4,"In the last three years I have had an Audi A4 quatrro and a Buick Regal GS, and this car is superior to both of them. The seats are the best that I have ever had, and the 6 cylinder turbo is powerful, and runs on regular fuel. Unlike the same feature in many other cars, the Sport mode enhances performance considerably. It is quiet, smooth, and much faster than I had expected. Mileage tends to average about 32 mpg on the highway, which is not outstanding but adequate. Interior and exterior styling is restrained and elegant, and the layout for all controls is excellent. I don't understand why I feel so few of these cars on the street."
volvo,s60,2013,keithv, 03/19/2013,Enjoying my new S60,4,"Only about 400 miles on the car so far, so still breaking it in.
The car is smooth and very comfortable, and I'm enjoying the T5's engine, which has better and smoother pickup than the VW EOS I traded in.

For the money, I don't think there is a car on the road with more comfortable seats than the Volvo.
The infotainment system is pretty intuitive.
There is a bit of wind noise in the cabin.
So far getting 23 MPG on regular, which should improve a bit when broken in.

The sales staff at Maroone/AutoNation Volvo in Delray Beach were easy to work with, and very accomodating when I had to factory order the car to get the ext/int combination I wanted.
I also got a very fair deal & trade."
volvo,s60,2013,tomhager, 12/05/2012,Solid sports sedan,4,"Traded in my Acura TSX after the second timing chain went out, test drove a T5 AWD and was hooked -- great combo of comfort and fun. Drove it through a late-night thunderstorm in the Oregon mountains and felt perfectly safe -- the thing corners like it's on rails. Love the power and quiet. "
volvo,s60,2013,KVogel, 05/18/2019,Finest car I've ever owned,5,"I am a serial car trader.  Normally I will buy a car, drive it for 30-40K miles, and go for something different.  This S60 has been different.  I just turned over 105K miles, the car still drives like the day I brought it home, and I can honestly see myself putting 200K on it.  Other than routine maintenance and gas, it has never cost me a penny or a day in the shop.  The strengths of this car for me are (1) Smooth power, linear torque, and good acceleration; (2) Strong, smooth brakes; (3) Understated, classy looks that have held up well vs. newer designs; (4) Rich leather that has aged incredibly well considering the hours I've spent in the driver's seat, along with a simple, uncluttered interior layout; (5) Great factory stereo that pairs flawlessly with multiple devices; (6) Spring loaded rear headrests that can be released from a button on the dash to unexpectedly smack smart-alecky kids in the head (a source of great amusement for the whole family).  If I could change anything, it would be:  (1) Transmission is not as smooth as some out there (my daughter's VW, for one).  It's always been just a little more twitchy; (2) Trunk space is OK, but awkward to get anything of any size in and out.  Putting back seats down doesn't help much.(3) Some of the silver trim on the center console is starting to flake/delaminate around the edges, and every once in a while a piece will get very sharp and has to be clipped off.  Bottom line though is that has simply been the finest vehicle I've ever owned.

volvo,s60,2013,jeffm5, 09/07/2012,A Blast To Drive,4,"My S60 T5 is the FWD model.
I've had it for about 6 wks. and have 2,000 mis. on it.
It's loaded with NAV and safety options.
Front seat comfort is outstanding.
All of the controls are on the steering wheel or within easy reach.
Handling is outstanding,, power and acceleration are very good.
The car has a solid feel.
No rattles.
Good visibility.
The ride is a little choppy on rough roads, very good otherwise.
I'm getting 30+ on the highway at about 65 MPH and around 24 in mixed driving with regular gas."
volvo,s60,2013,jimdd, 04/11/2014,Good start but could use a little help....,4,"Been driving my S60 R-Design for just over a year.
Great styling differentiates this car from a standard A4 or 3-Series.
Motor is smooth and powerful with very little or no turbo lag.

Interior is clean and comes off like a German car with a little twist.
I actually use the on-dash dial pad often.  It's not simply a gimmick.

All in all, its a nice upgrade from my G37x but leaves me wanting just a little more.
Maybe I'll consider the new Limited Edition R-Design if it isn't cost prohibitive.

Update:   The breaks are still horrible.   Couple of distinct rattles which are well hidden.

In short, after test driving a 2013 S60 T5, Âit was a no brainerÂ I went ahead and leased it on the spot (it was that easy). "
volvo,s60,2013,virginiacarguy, 09/03/2012,I look forward to driving this S60 every day,5,"Having owned many BMWs, Audi, Acura and various other cars and SUVs, this S60 is the perfect balance of comfort and fun to drive. The old Volvo stereotypes are long gone. While it doesn't have the track or tech specs of a 3 series (like 50/50 weight distribution), it excels at daily driving by perfectly balancing performance and comfort. The S60 is smooth, quiet, composed, solid, quick, very comfortable with superb seats and firm suspension that is never harsh.
I recommend the Polestar modification that makes the vehicle faster, reduces throttle/pedal travel and makes power available more immediately. A loaded 325 hp S60 is thousands less than a loaded 4 cyl BMW."
volvo,s60,2013,kmjs_1, 02/15/2013,A smart choice (for me),4,"I was looking for a replacement for my '03 IS300 Sportcross and ended up test driving everything from a Mini Clubman S to the new Lexus ES.
All over the map.
But I kept coming back to the Volvo S60 because it was comfortable to drive (front seats are amazing), felt solid as a rock, had good acceleration running on regular, and could be bought for much less than competitors.
The long term review of the 2012 model on Inside Line was almost all positive as were other published reports.
The 2013 T5 model improved in acceleration and gas mileage, nice combo of improvements.
 Reliable, comfortable, a great value. So now I own a Caspian blue with beechwood leather S60 T5 and am a happy camper."

Honestly it is like it was a new car and I was lucky to have found a Platinum with all the bells and whistles. The drive is great, smooth handling. The audio is phenomenal.

volvo,s60,2013,jschuld, 09/29/2012,Performance plus fuel efficiency,4,"Having owned a 2005 TSX, 2006 TL, 2011 Maxima, I was looking for something a little different.
I really liked the looks and performance of the Maxima, but driving 45,000 miles a year was taking it's toll on the wallet with premium gasoline and 25 mpg.
I like decent performance in a car and that is one reason I passed on Volvo each time I took a test ride in the past.
When I noticed the new S60, it really caught my attention.
Having driven my S69 6000 miles now, I can say it's the favorite car I have owned.
The ride is a lot like the TL, there is a great feeling for the road and it handles turns exceptionally well. It also runs fine on 87 octane fuel."

It has been happening every morning when the temperature is below 50 degree, and it happens only the first time you start the engine.
After the first time, everything is fine.

The freeway ride quality is great.
It is fairly quiet on good road surfaces.

Now the bad stuff:
Had an a/c problem with a pressure relief valve. Took 4 visits to resolve even though it is a known issue.
Had a bad fuel pump, causing hard starting from cold. Took 4 visits to resolve even though it is a known issue.
Have a steering wobble at speeds around 40mph. This is ""normal"" according to Volvo.
Engine surges and is jerky in any gear and at any speed. This is ""normal"" according to Volvo.
Transmission experiences a delay engaging first gear when pulling away from a stop. This results in a jerk."
volvo,s60,2013,frugal_car_guy, 03/08/2014,Excellent Car Poor gas Mileage initially in T5 AWD,4,"My original review was more negative, but the more I drive it, the better I like it. I wish I had the voice activated phone and built in garage door opener, but that's only on the top of the line. Overall, it's the best car I've ever owned. I have owned a T5 AWD automatic premier for 2 years now. While I initially got poor gas mileage, it has improved to almost 22 over all, and I got 32 MPG highway on my last road trip.  I get about 21.5 in typical suburban driving and commuting. (FYI: In 2015, the new 4 cyl engine is faster and gets 25 city, 37 highway.) Other than that the car handles great, is very smooth and comfortable and has very good acceleration. I have had no problems so far. Another negative is that the controls, radio, seat heater etc. are a bit difficult to operate, but eventually I got used to it.  This car is smoother, more comfortable, quieter, and handles better than my wife's 2012 Acura TL. I got a great deal on a demo. Free scheduled maintenance is a bonus and cost saver.

volvo,s60,2013,Lynn E., 07/03/2018,Great small sedan!,5,"It doesn't get any safer than a Volvo! Additionally, the turn radius is excellent, the city braking is a very useful back-up, and the interior is very comfortable. The dual climate zone works well, as do the auto climate and heated seats. The only downsides to the car in my experience have been the fuel economy (not great, but the price you pay for driving a small tank, safety-wise) and the Navigation system. Whatever software the navigation uses is terrible and frequently takes completely illogical routes. I just end up using my phone's navigation. Overall, I love the car.

"
volvo,s60,2013,Thomas Gannon, 04/06/2016,Not Really a Sedan,2,"You may call this vehicle a sedan but after 2+ years with this vehicle it is better classified as a coupe. Sure it has 4 doors but the back seat is useless. The trunk isn't much better. At 12cu. ft. even a simple weekly trip to the grocery store requires items to be put in the back seat for the trip home. As for a road trip with more than 2 people just forget it. There is no way to put enough luggage in the trunk for anything more than a weekend and anything bigger than an infant in the back seat is a joke. Ironically, the only people that would fit in the back seat only make the lack of trunk space worse because they require even more stuff. Fuel economy on a vehicle of this size is awful. I owned a Accord before this vehicle and the mileage was on average 35% better for a vehicle that was bigger and older. The audio controls are confusing and lack simple functions. The Volvo system stores information some logical and some not so logical places. The resale value of this car has plummeted and I am not in a market where there are a number of these vehicles available so oversupply is not driving down the price. If we had not traded a paid in full vehicle against the purchase I would be upside down on the loan. We looked at other Volvo's to replace this one but found most suffer from the same lack of seating in the rear seats. If your going into this purchase thinking you are buying a sedan look elsewhere, if you wwant to pretend your buying a family car and really buying a sport coupe then this is a good vehicle for you.

When trying to pass, the transmission takes too long to respond.

volvo,s60,2013,hashmd, 02/25/2013,Best Car I have owned yet,5,"My previous car was a top of the line 2006 Chrysler Town and Country.

This car was the perfect balance of luxury, ride, performance, and gas mileage, all on REGULAR gas! Other luxury performance cars are strictly Premium grade gas. And this car passed the newest type of crash test at the IIHS which Mercedes, Audi, BMW didn't pass at all. Acura barely passed. Do other cars get better performance specs? Sure, but they cost noticably more. BMW gets better mileage, but again at higher purchase price and premium gas. 
2/25/17-Now the 2nd best car I have ever owned. My new best car is my 2016 Volvo XC90. That is a whole another review!

After the first day, the car when given light gas as in heavy traffic or starting from stop has a rattle sound like a paint can.
The car went back 10 times from the dealer.

volvo,s60,2013,Myneed4swede, 10/08/2020,Swedish Tanks unite!,4,"I purchased my 2013 Volvo S60 T5 with approximately 88,000 miles on it three years ago in 2017. It was a one owner vehicle that was maintained by one dealer the whole time. First off I want to say that overall I am very happy with my S60 as a major upgrade from a 2008 Honda Civic I owned previously from power to driver engagement and over to having some of the most comfortable seats in any vehicle under $100k! Not to mention the quality vault-like door shutting sound is almost unheard of in this price segment. 
 I purposely sought out a 2013 and newer model since I knew the 2011 and 2012 models were affected by the piston ring Technical service bulletin(TSB) for oil consumption. Little did I know that I was buying an oil burner as well. 
I do all of my own repairs and service on my vehicles and religiously change the oil in the Volvo every 5,000 miles with Pennzoil Platinum full synthetic 5w30 and a Mann oil filter. Despite this and the impeccable service records of the dealer previous to my ownership the 2.5L would burn oil at the rate of 1QT/1000 miles. I decided to live with it that way for a couple of years since there isn't alot you can do in my state when it comes to vehicles purchased used ""as is"", even when bought through a dealer. Besides, I really enjoyed the rest of the vehicle. In the first two years I had to replace the driver’s side door lock actuator, full tune up, and replace the pcv/oil filter assembly. This revealed another downside, parts for Volvo's that are under 5 years old are right up there in price with the other European counterparts of VW and BMW; so don't expect to pay Honda Accord or Toyota Camry low cost levels for maintenance or repairs.
Then 2 years into ownership with 120k miles on the clock I started having fouled spark plugs due to the excessive oil consumption despite the plugs only having 20k miles on Volvo OEM plugs. After further research I found the TSB for oil consumption was expanded to include 2013-2017 models with the 2.5L Turbo engine. I contacted Volvo corporate in Sweden and had them look over the vehicle. They confirmed that it was affected by the oil consumption and agreed to replace the piston rings at about 45% cost being passed on to me. But, they were willing to replace the Timing belt, water pump, belts, and tensioner that I purchased and provided to them. 
Being a TSB and not a recall the manufacturer is not obligated to pay for any of the repairs. So, seeing that Volvo was willing to meet me half-way gives me confidence that they stand by their products much more than most manufacturers do this day and age. Since this work was completed I’ve only had to replace a fuel pressure sensor that was acting up giving intermittent lost power issues that requires removing the air box and intake manifold to replace. Along with changing the transmission fluid for what I assume is the first service and it was BLACK (should be red).

If you do your research on many vehicles you will find that the oil consumption is a pretty common issue across the board with many manufacturers trying to push the limits of the ever increasing fuel efficiency standards. And if you stick with the 2.5L Turbo as in the 2013's, you can rest assured you will never have the carbon buildup issues that plague almost all direct injection engines since Volvo still used good old port fuel injection with the 2.5. 
Now at 145k miles it runs great with the same power and luxury feel that it had when I bought it. Just got back from a 2,000 mile road trip without a single hiccup that returned 28mpg average while traveling through mostly mountainous roads. In mixed commuting I usually average 23mpg on Premium fuel. Looking to get another even more reliable 100k more miles out of the ole Swede!

Overall, if you are looking for the higher end luxury feel that can only come from a European car without having to completely
 drain your wallet to the likes of an Audi or BMW, give Volvo a shot. It’s a little bit less of a “drivers car” than the aforementioned but your much lower insurance costs and overall maintenance will show it. Would definitely recommend to anyone trying to break into the segment.

volvo,s60,2013,Rafael A., 10/14/2020,So far so good Volvo s60 FWD,5,As an owner of a 3.2 a5 and a 2.5 volvo i got to say that when i step in the volvo i dont have that anxiety feeling that i do with my A5 hoping nothing breaks down lol. I just feel comfortable and feels really reliable. My a5 is a head turner because its modified and the volvo is just under the radar which i like. Althought the AWD would have been better i dont worry much because of the complexity of the awd. Only dowmside of my volvo is that i cant see a temp gauge which can be a problem if the tech on car is bad ir faulty. Overall i love this car for longevity and used my Audi as a weekend car.
volvo,s60,2014,quattrofan74, 11/12/2013,2 years with my S60 T5 AWD,3,"My wife and I decided to downsize with the aim of lowering our overall car payment. My previous car was a 2008 BMW 335i coupe. I loved that car - it's performance, handling and appearance endeared itself to me daily. However, I live in Pennsylvania and winters in it were never really ""fun"". Also, getting the kids to school became a chore - and a sedan made sense. 

I decided to lease this time around. Long story short, I got a S60 T5 AWD with Premier and Sport packages. 

Overall, the car has a decent amount of ""go"". It's no 335i, but it pulls off the line well. It gets a little asthmatic as the revs climb. The Sport package definitely made a difference in handling too. "
volvo,s60,2014,darkhorse2, 04/30/2014,Very Good Car/Great Value,5,"All's well after 25,000 miles. Still as quiet as day 1.  Still love the way the car performs.  Comfortable, quiet and handling is great and performance with the ""base"" engine is surprisingly quick.  NOT like the Audi A3 I rented a little while ago.  Only complaint....the original Continental tires were shop after 19,000 miles!!!  Changed to Pirelli's and am much happier with them especially in the wet.

I just picked up my S60 a few days ago after comparing quite a few cars. Audi A4, Buick Regal, Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Cadillac ATS, BMW 3 series & Mercedes new A class.
The Volvo was overall the best choice for me as an everyday car. It does all things well and represented a great car for the money. A bit more money than the fully loaded Ford, Buick and Honda but with better quality and features. The same feel and features of the Audi, Mercedes and Cadillac but without a higher price tag and the horrible excuse for a back seat.

volvo,s60,2014,Kern Ries, 03/01/2016,Saved my wife's life,5,"I bought a certified used 2013 Volvo S60 with AWD in August 2015, with 17K miles on it. It came with a 7-year/100,00 mile warranty, which is unbeatable. I had to have the driver's side door sensor and the pump for the windshield washer fixed under warranty at that start, but no problems since then. The car has plenty of power, is very comfortable and easy to drive on long trips. It is the most comfortable car I have owned. On Presidents' Day 2016, my wife was driving uphill with about an inch of fresh snow on the road, when a driver coming down the hill lost control and slide sideways into her late so quickly that she had no chance to react. The combined speed of the crash probably was in the 50 to 60 mph range. My wife got only a sore chest and some bruises on her hips from the seatbelt, but otherwise she did not have a scratch.  All of the airbags deployed. The car was totaled. I'm so glad that she was riding in a Volvo when the accident happened. I'm now looking to replace it with another a year newer.

volvo,s60,2014,John H, 05/22/2017,"Value, Performance, Sex Appeal (in that order)",5,"I researched vehicles in this class thoroughly before making a buying decision.  First, let me state that I have no need for any of the common bells and whistles that manufacturers have been adding to vehicles these days such as lane departure warnings, park assist, even navigation.  This review does not evaluate those areas because quite frankly I don't care about them or use them.  I'm motivated by the following:  how does the car drive, how does the car look, does the car meet my interior/storage needs and how reliable is the car?  That's it.  With that in mind, let's get started.  I narrowed the field down to the Audi S4, Lexus IS350 and the Volvo S60-T6 since all had similar performance specs like 300 HP and AWD as well as identical 0-60 times.   In terms of pure driving performance and sex appeal, the S4 and IS350 win without question.  I'd put the IS350 as the champ.  However, after many test drives I came to realize that 90-95% of the performance those cars offer can be found in the S60-T6 for only 70% of the price.  In other areas such as rear passenger area & trunk space, the S60 was the winner.  I've only owned this car for 30 days so I can't speak to the reliability yet, but I'm expecting industry-standard costs.  One of the things I've noticed is that it's not as smooth in Sport mode both in up/down shifting as the others, but in regular drive mode it's fine.  Aside from that, it's a joy to drive and at a fraction of the cost of it's peers.  And even though I didn't need a luxurious leather seat, it truly is like sinking into a Lay-Z-Boy recliner--amazing.  Bottom line: if you're looking for best in class regardless of price, look to Audi or Lexus and expect to pay $7k-$10k more.  If you want the best interior comfort & space, equal acceleration, 95% driving dynamics and 90% sex appeal for 70% of cost compared to rivals, the S60-T6 is the choice to make.  I've been incredibly happy with it.

volvo,s60,2014,John B., 05/24/2016,Finally happy after many other cars,5,"I've owned a lot of vehicles and my S60 finally seems to hit the sweet spot of European performance and luxury with the reliability and lower cost of ownership I desire. It is just an all-around competent vehicle that is a pleasure to get in and drive everyday. It has a super high quality feel - like it's built very solid, something I didn't get in my Accord or Camry Hybrid. I just love the leather interior in this car - it is thick, comfortable, and smells great. The performance is more than adequate with the 5 cyl T5, steering and handling are excellent, and the comfort on long road trips is great, even with two bikes on the roof. Reliability has been fine - just routine maintenance required, and one A/C component replaced under warranty. I couldn't be happier.

Update - still happy with my S60. I do sometimes wish I had the newer 4 cyl Drive-E, as it gets better mpg with the same performance, but everything else about this car is superb,  so I'll live with it. I get 24 mpg in mostly urban driving with 29-30 on highway trips.

volvo,s60,2014,mps_, 11/02/2013,"2014 S60 R-Design with Platinum Package, BLIS, Climate package",3,"So far I like this car and it is fun to drive.
It works very well as a daily driver and has some good kick, although it is still far from a sports car.
I have one major issue with this car.
 Volvo has built heating elements into the windshield (small wires every few millimeters).
At night all lights reflect off of these wires and makes the lights blurry.
It is a huge safety issue and is extremely annoying.
Due to this issue alone, I am not sure if I will keep this car very long.
Although it is nice to have a heated steering wheel, skip the Climate Package if you buy this car."
volvo,s60,2014,The Kid, 07/11/2015,Great unexpected find,5,"I was in the market for an all wheel drive sedan and was really looking at Audi's and Lexus's and after leaving the Lexus dealer I saw a Volvo dealership and decided to stop. Never even considered a Volvo in the process. Anyway took it for a test drive and leased it the same day. Number one reason I got was the comfort of the seats and was truly happy on the way it drove and the functionality of the car. They have come a long way on the looks of their vehicles, should at least give it a test drive. Think u might be as surprised as I was!!

volvo,s60,2014,Mike C, 01/21/2019,T6 With a Real 6!,5,"I've owned my 2014 T6 Volvo for four years now - I just turned 56,000 and it still runs like new. Mine is Ice White - and I'm glad as I'm not a fan of the fancy metallic whites. My factory warranty included everything - including wear and tear items like windshield wipers and brake pads - which they kindly replaced at my request at 49,500 miles. I was treated like a king at every service appointment (Waukesha, WI dealer) and have not yet had one single reason to go in for any issue - scheduled maintenace is all I needed. My car has the 19"" Bor wheels running P7 Pirelli Cinturato's and they are indeed good for all-seasons - and I live in Wisconsin. My only mistake was blowing over $2,000 on a set of snow tires with BBS wheels I bought from The Tire Rack. Great service from the company but I used them the first year for about a thousand miles and just never had a need to put them back on for snow as the P7's work great with the all-wheel drive - the biggest issue I've had is driving through snow deep enough that the front end was lower than the snow on the road but it still plowed right through! Great car in snow. Random comments as they cross my mind while I type....The navigation system is by far the worst I've ever used - it's only when you know where you're at that you realize the stupid thing is taking you out of the way. It's brutal. I suppose if I'm driving to Florida it would get the three Interstates right but for all else - pull out your cell phone and use Google Maps or Waze. Very roomy front seat - plenty of elbow-shoulder-leg room. The back seat is a place you'll not want to be if you're an adult and you better hope you don't have Jimmy-legs because you'll end up pulling your hair out. If you need a back seat on a regular basis-look elsewhere. I drove a Ford pickup as my main vehicle for 25 years before this and I love how handy and easy to park this thing is. Performance is outstanding - I love-love-love the sound of that inline 6 turbo coming out those dual exhausts and with the tire-wheel setup it is an excellent handler. If you see one of these for sale with decent mileage - grab one unless you're a fan of whiny overworked 4's. All in all - I love this car.

volvo,s60,2014,Danny, 09/23/2015,Great Good car with glitches,3,"The dealer has made almost everything right...
In the first 6 months they replaced  
-faulty  door sensor (lft rear pass side)
-faulty ignition pump- car failed to start on the first try when the gas gauge was at 1 bar ( I recorded the starting problem on my cell phone which was a big help in troubleshooting the problem).
Sometimes  the roof liner rattles- the dealer couldn't find the problem.
The front tires wore unevenly at 20 k. I had the tires rotated (free) and paid $100 for a front end alignment because it was past the adjustment period.

I have had a s80, xc70 , xc90 or, and a 2012 s60 fwd which was faster and more fuel efficient but squirrelly when accelerating on turns/curves and less refined car overall than the 2014 s60.

I will try something else when this lease is up- maybe a Lexus. I like reliability.

volvo,s60,2014,Steve O, 06/29/2017,"Very well put together, but pass on the NAV",4,"I don't want to repeat what everyone else has said, but a few things are worth emphasizing:  Volvo's seats are VERY comfortable, even for my 6'3"" frame.  Performance is not the same as a BMW, but neither is the price.  You might as well pass on the useless piece of electronic garbage they call a NAV system.  I came from an Infinity M35, and I might have only Volvo's from now on.  The car just feels very well put together.

90,000 mile update:  The lack of a spare tire has left me stranded a couple of times now.  Volvo service came and towed me each time, which was nice, but it can be a wait.  Maybe I should have paid the $300 for a $20 spare tire.  An inflation kit doesn't help when you've had a blowout.  Have had zero mechanical issues otherwise.

Update: The stock tires sold with the S60 get very noisy in the 2nd half of their life.  I've figured out the weirdness of the NAV.  It's still awkward, but I'll upgrade it to ""usable.""

volvo,s60,2014,Frank Lashbrooke, Sr.,Best cars I've ever owned!,5,"I am an 80 year old man who has owned numerous cars including Volvo.  I have owned both domestic and import cars since I was 16 years old.  The best cars I have ever had and/or owned have been the Swedish brand,  Volvo.  Without exception, each Volvo I have owned has always been beautiful, well designed down to the last knob or switch.  Each one has always served me so well that now I won't buy anything else!  These cars I view as the best cars western Europe produces - up to and including BMW, Mercedes, Audi and SAAB.  Every Volvo I have owned has ALWAYS done the job I wanted it to do and then some.  Although I don't feel the sense of pride of ownership or prestige I might feel with a Beemer, Mercedes, or Audi, I always feel I own and am driving western Europe's very best brand.  I have told many friends who ask me why I own a Volvo and I tell them it is the best car Europe produces, bar none!  In my opinion, there is no better car made, period!  Volvo cars, again, in my opinion, provide the owner the best value in automotive transportation out there!  Out of all the cars I have owned, the Volvo brand has proven its worthiness of my loyalty and money.  Buying a Volvo is by far the best car for anyone's money and then some.  Needless to say, I won't buy anything else, EVER!  BRAVO VOLVO!  BRAVO SWEDEN!

I’m up around 100k now (almost out of warranty), and other than a single failed parking sensor (replaced for free) a couple years back, absolutely nothing has gone wrong with this car.

My car has the distinctive Beachwood leather, which still looks fantastic. Car is fast, solid, and comfortable. Stereo is great. Only problem is that I financed it for too long and am currently a few grand upside-down on it. No plans to replace it any time soon, so that doesn’t matter much at the moment.

Folks beware if you own a 2014 Volvo S60 sedan with a sunroof if you have not had problems you will have problems with water draining into the cabin of the car during heavy rain.  I believe there is a design flaw with the drainage system with 2014 Volvo S60 sedans that have a sunroof, and I feel Volvo needs to own this issue and recall and repair of replacing the entire system at their cost.  I do not want anyone else to experience what I have I will as of this week have spent $6000 dollar replacing the entire draining system and drainage pan under the sunroof.  This is unacceptable and an expense that no one should have to bear for such an expensive vehicle."

Purchased a 2014 with 32k miles on it.  The acceleration is amazing with automatic and shifting gears.  Nice to enter the freeway and go from 25mph to 75mph in a matter of seconds.  Living in Houston, all you see is Lexus, Infiniti and BMW's.....not a ton of Volvo's and especially not many T6 R-Design.  That's fine---they can pay the higher dollar to drive one of those and feed their ego.  This car is as good or better than cars costing a lot more (IMHO).

volvo,s60,2015,slin3, 09/11/2014,Totally enjoying my 2015.5 S60 T5 AWD,5,"I have driven my 2015.5 S60 T5 AWD with Platinum package and BLIS for more than 1 month. Before purchase, I also test-drove 2014 BMW 328i xDrive, 2014 Lexus IS250 AWD, 2015 Audi A3 Quattro, 2014 Acura TL SH-AWD, in addition to 2014 S60 T5 (non-AWD). While I bought the car mainly for crash rating and safety feature, I was pleasantly surprised by how well/fun/engaging it runs. Among all the cars I tested, only 328i is slightly more fun with a much higher price tag. During the summer promotion I also got 5-year free maintenance. Overall a great value, with superior interior comfort, fun driving experience, and unbeatable safety features."
volvo,s60,2015,MYOB, 11/16/2015,"29 months in, very pleased but wish we got the V60",4,"S60 R design Platinum.   Zero issues over the past 2 years plus.  Mileage is 22.5mpg short trips mostly with a couple of highway trips a year, 28 mpg on expressway at 70mph,   Gas tank is maybe 17 gal so range is only about 450 miles w/o pushing your luck.  

Acceleration is as much as a sane person would every need.  Effortless and tons of torque is around way down low in the rev band.   Smooth engine that growls if you punch it but is otherwise quiet.   Throttle uptake is very touchy, unfortunately, taking a light foot to avoid lurching forward. 

Steering is precise but could use more road feel, though almost no cars have that any more.  AWD and 350 lb ft of torque are a great pairing, as you can floor it from a stop and turn into traffic with no fear of fishtailing, and it gives great confidence.  Minimal body roll, changed to almost none with the addition of an aftermarket tuner rear anti-sway bar.  I have since removed the aftermarket bar and sold it, finding it unnecessary.  Handling is confidence inspiring.  Reviews that talk of small differences between this and BMW are living in a fantasy land where people oversteer their cars around curves on public roads.   The G forces you feel in turns are more than enough to have you slow down before the grip of the tires is lost to understeer.   This is a sport sedan, not a sports car.  

Braking is not as quick as the XC60,  with the pedal having more play before it really bites.  Once you're used to the difference it's fine.  

Ride quality is firm but never harsh, noise levels are good on good roads, higher on bad ones.  But again, never uncomfortable.   Better ride and noise levels than our E90 BMW 3 series with 18"" wheels, I'd say.   We have the 19"" on this R design.   But this car will not please those looking for luxury quiet first and foremost.   On concrete expressways you get tire hum.

Trunk is pretty small,  rear seat room isn't an issue for us but it isn't big.  But we added 2 more dogs for a total of 4 so we wish we'd waited to find a V60 R design for the extra space in back. 

Insurance costs are low ($850/yr full coverage $500K liability) but we are middle aged.  

The upgraded Platinum level Stereo is surprisingly good for having no dedicated sub-woofer.  The Nav system is not very good at all.   Just use your phone or a Garmin.  It will send you on crazy turns on small roads and the interface is cumbersome.   The dash is great looking and the big digital speed readout really makes a HUD superfluous.   Climate control works fine, the interface for the entertainment system is not touch but works fine once you learn that the button on the wheel controls most things. (along with one on the panel your passenger can operate)

Comfort is great on long trips, the seats are the best I've had in a sedan.  They soften with time, btw. 

  Visibility is not great in blind spots.  I thought the BLIS was a waste of money, but it really comes in handy in heavy expressway traffic where long looks at your blind spot are not always safe.   I still check, but do so knowing my BLIS will back me up and alert if I try to signal a turn with someone there.   It also has the ability to ""See""   cars overtaking you and prevent you from getting in front of them if there isn't time for them to react.   It works very well and unobtrusively with a light most of the time, alerting only if you attempt to change lanes.  

The interior has held up well and I expect it to continue to.  Material quality really is superior, it's just that some people expect to see German or Japanese design and this has a Swedish mentality to it.   Basic, sparse, but high quality.  

Negatives would be that the transmission is a little lazy in regular mode.  Sport mode sure solves that, but at the expense of holding lower gears a little longer than you'd like in routine driving.  But for spirited driving, it's great.
  Another issue would be that the bluetooth streaming will cut out for a second every now and then at first, then eventually settle down and work well.    The Nav is a disgrace, 

The 5 year warranty with full maintenance we got free during a summer promotion helps offset the biggest negative, the poor resale value.    We thought about trading ours for a V60 but found it was worth about $10,000 less than we paid for it after a year.   This will flatten out, but for some reason all Volvos seem to take a steep initial drop in value, and some, like the S60, keep dropping.     We paid about $6500 less than MSRP in 2014.

Overall, besides the BMW 328i, which will cost a little more and be a little less quick,  I wouldn't seriously consider another make for this specific class of car.  However, I do prefer slightly larger vehicles for the interior ""elbow room"".    The BMW will have a bigger back seat.    

And yes, Volvos are built like vaults.   Very solid.   Still loving it and we're hard to please.

volvo,s60,2015,roubaud, 06/30/2015,2015.5 T5 Platinum Shines Brightly,5,"I had a 2012 S60 T5 and loved it, but wanted xenons (all Volvo cars should have xenons period). The 2015.5 platinum makes an already good car superb. It's simply fun to drive -- not as fun as my old Merc C230 coupe, but still pretty darn good for a sedan. Mileage in the first few months is about 33 hwy and 28-29 combined -- that should get better, indeed I hope it does with the touted drive-e engine (I was at 24 combined in my 2012 T5).

14 months later my combined mileage barely holds on to 29mpg -- that's equal to or less than many CUVs on the market now; one would think it'd be well over 30 in a small sedan. After being saved by the collision mitigation warning light and beep (almost rear ended someone), it's now something I ignore. It will go off when I'm driving in housing divisions and weaving around parked cars on the road. 

What I REALLY wish this car had was more tech, or easy tech. I want to be on my phone or desktop and EASILY send directions to a destination (because it takes FOREVER to do it in the car). You have to use a special app / website, then it doesn't always load in the car, and if it does, it will take many, many minutes. So, still a lot of updating to do there. 

I also wish with voice nav you could say ""Nearest Arby's"" or whatever, instead of being forced into ""Nearest restaurant"" and scrolling through the list forever; all that time when my eyes are not on the road. But hands down one of the BEST radar cruise control systems -- takes you all the way down to zero and has excellent distance (much farther than my wife's loaded Mazda 6).

Otherwise, great performance, love the turbo, awesome seats on my long trips, still looks good, not many others drive one (a shame!), and the value is superb for what you get. Absolutely a BMW and MERC alternative.

volvo,s60,2015,fordescortgt, 08/04/2014,Fast and Fun,5,"This is a great highway car. It is very composed, fairly quiet, and extremely comfortable while commuting back and forth the 80 miles to work. The car is an absolute rocket, whether in sport mode or not. However what is truly nice is that you have an option. In normal mode the car will accelerate off the line with the authority dictated by how hard you press your right foot down, but you can also drive quite leisurely. Switch to sport and the car is absolutely manic, press the gas and hold on. The car feels like it will never stop accelerating. The only draw back in sport mode is it feels twitchy all the time. "

The front seats are very adjustable and provide a lot of head/leg space, and the telescoping steering wheel range is better than in all other cars I tested in its class. Many reviews mention that there is limited leg room in the 2nd row. What are people expecting? This is a mid-size sport sedan.  When you have people in the back, you have to adjust your seat and drive in a less-than-optimal position. Get real.

I like car seats that I can move up, tilt the bottom part, adjust pretty much everything so I can reach the pedals and also see the road... this car is perfect for me in so many ways but the seats are the most important... I also love confortable seats and these are truly amazing.  I love gadgets and technology and I feel this comes loaded, love the number pad.... I make many calls for work so I find it very practical, I was very annoyed by the start-stop engine system but you can disable it when you run the car on , which is great. I wanted the MB CLA but they did not give me a good deal so went with the dealer that sold me my VW and after looking at the cc and Eos wasn't convinced , they are great cars but the cc felt for older people and the Eos was again a 2 door car and was tired of having a 2 door car... it does look  bit like many new other cars out there pretty much every make has a model similar to the S60 but it is still a good looking sedan with nice clean lines.  The adjustable lumbar part of the front seats and heated seats are also a plus... I use it even in the summer in FL. I am not a fan of the dual AC ... it is kind of annoying. at least for me. I like that the cover for sunroof is totally sun proof unlike mercedes and vw which are not 100% sun proof and I can't stand feeling the sun on my head specially since I can't be under the sun. My daughters say the seats in the back are confortable, I like that you can (at the push of a button) tilt the hardest in the back seats to allow better visibility...

I compared to Cadillac ATS, Lincoln MKZ, BMW 325i  It was the most affordable and really didn't require any compromises (MKZ had a little more space)

I purchased my 2015 S60 during the second half of 2014.  I will note at the outset that I ""love"" my car.  I enjoy the way it performs, the speed, the handling, etc.  It's a bit tight (I'm 6'2"") but overall it's been a great buy.  My only issue has been on maintenance and I can't decide whether it's the vehicle or the dealership which I've been using for maintenance.  I've had three instances where ""major"" repairs have been required, the most recent of which is currently in the works and involves replacing spark plugs which should not need to be replaced after merely 18,500 miles.  I've already had one internal sensor replaced at the recommendation of VOLVO Central and it's likely that this current repair will require the replacement of a cylinder.  I've had this vehicle for less than two years, and it has ""granny"" miles (coming up on 18,500) yet somehow it's required days worth of repairs.  Recognizing that these repairs are all covered under the current warranty (thank God) it's still a bit of a disappointment because I enjoy this vehicle.  Once I get the vehicle back to health - from fuel economy to comfort, it's a great purchase. Just starting to wonder whether VOLVO sold me the proverbial ""lemon.""
"
volvo,s60,2015,Unique like everyone else, 06/22/2017,Great choice for AWD sedan but...,4,"OVERALL:  A nice car to drive, safe and solid, performs well, but Volvo charges more than many other brands and provides less in some key areas, like rear seat and trunk space, spare tire, GPS traffic guidance, etc. 
GOOD: Great styling (my opinion), excellent handling and brakes, excellent (Volvo!) safety ratings, very comfortable front seating, AWD is very sure-footed and even helps with powered turns on dry pavement.   Sound system is very good quality ('tho the antenna is not very good compared to most other cars).   Excellent interior materials.  Dealer support is excellent.    NOT SO GOOD: 5-cyl ""T5"" engine has decent power, especially at lower speeds where it is very torquey, but unimpressive at highway speeds.  Some noticeable wind noise, fair amount of odd or annoying noises from the many electronics.  Volvo GPS navigation is okay but slow, very slow, really sloooooooow, sometimes gives direction after you've passed the place to do it, and entering destinations can be VERY frustrating or even impossible, but does make good calls on traffic conditions.  
BAD:  [UPDATE: Traffic guidance expired, to get it back requires a complicated process of Internet subscription, traffic reports subscription, etc., all at extra monthly costs.  A $150 Garmin can have LIFETIME traffic and map updates, so I guess ""Swedish luxury"" is cheapo and not so good??]   No ""cubbies"", so no open or casual storage for driver stuff beyond the glove box and console box, both of which are okay but awkward to reach while driving.   The alleged ""city traffic"" automatic braking feature has never worked when tested (??).   NO SPARE TIRE INCLUDED; The standard gel tire repair system may serve for most punctures, but if a large puncture or tear, it's useless, and it can potentially ruin wheel balance and/or the TPMS sensor so add cost and trouble to your follow-up repair woes.  Adding a spare tire is in my opinion the right thing to do but it's not cheap and the trunk then goes from ""small but okay"" to almost useless.   So much for this being an expensive luxury car!    Things going in and out of the trunk will chip the rear bumper paint, no rubber bumper guard like on most other cars, even low-priced ones.     Rear seat room is honestly a cruel joke unless midgets are in the front seats so front seats are pulled all the way up to provide (sigh) minimal leg and foot room in back, and even then the roof downslope makes it claustrophobic.  There was and I think still is a ""stretched"" version of the S60 with more rear seat room that I think is the only way to buy an S60, significantly more expensive and still not great but at least acceptable and useable.   Trunk is okay if you do not add an (optional!!) spare tire, but not having a spare tire is, to me, foolish.  Update, end of 2019: The media/info screen system is tedious, unsafe to use while driving.  Buttons and dials must be looked at by the driver to tell one from the other, no tactile differentiation.  Still like the car but obviously the designers just looked at things on their CAD screens and never drove the car.  Okay but not a real driver's car.  Still fun to drive, still exceptionally safe if/when needed, solid, but so many unnecessary and unexpected annoyances, so flawed.

volvo,s60,2015,LaShun Rice, 01/12/2019,Worst Decision Ever!,1,"This car is a total piece of crap. The gas mileage is poor and has never met the 30-37 mpg it advertised. The start/stop function drains the battery. I have had the battery replaced 3 times in 4 years and $360/battery is not what I consider reliable. The car has been to the shop 8 times for problems. So far, I had to replace the fuel pressure sensor, thermostat, right engine mount, parking brake sensor (I don’t even use the parking brake) which was sticking and wearing my break pads, not to mention not safe, fuel pump, engine coils and spark plugs (under recall), and fuel compression regulator. I have spent $2,500 in just 3 weeks. My senors either go off for no reason or don’t alert me when they should have. I like the seats and stirring wheel which are comfortable. It LOOKS great.  The ride is rough and I hear a grinding noise when I drive, which Volvo cannot isolate the problem, nor do they care when I reported it. The battery they replaced was faulty and I had to cont BBB just to get them to replace it. Because it was replaced under warranty, they wouldn’t replace it out of warranty even though they replaced the bad battery with a faulty one. That is when I decided that I will never purchase another Volvo in my lifetime and I do not recommend this car. I’m going to a competitor with a reliable vehicle. Poor service, poor reliability, outrageous repair costs and the betrayal of my trust in a brand where they did not deliver. My loyalty with Volvo ended 12/12/18. If you’re looking for something nice looking but not reliable, this is definitely the car for you. Safely matters if I’m in an accident. I’ve never been in one in this car so I cannot comment on safety.

volvo,s60,2015,It's Kansas Toto, 05/19/2018,"New slogan: ""Volvo? Not all it's cracked up to be""",2,"Though I am a baby boomer, I never aspired to own a muscle car. I was always more intrigued by the European cars with classic lines and implied quality. Beemers were trendy but cars like Saab and Volvo were something to aspire to. With one of those, you had quality and class. Right? Not anymore. Sadly, they've killed Saab. Ive now leased my Volvo just over 3 years and it's time to turn over the keys. There's nothing about this car I will miss. Not the random way the e-drive would kill the engine just as the light turned green (reminiscent really of learning to drive my first stick shift car and popping the clutch to a lurch and dead engine). I won't  miss the eay bluetooth would randomly go on strike. Or the way the warning beeps that so steadfastly warn when the car is too close to a curb or wall or another car... until it doesn't.  Or just for fun starts randomly beeping when you are certifiably in the middle of nowhere with no obstacles for 20 feet in any direction. I could go on but why. This car was a disappointment. My local dealer (the ONLY Volvo dealer in a metropolitan area of over 2 million!) Over promises and under delivers and features a service department who specialize in mansplaining. I especially loved the way I would schedule service with a confirmed loaner car for the day only to be told there were no S60s available that day. Fine, I said...  give me something else. You would have thought I'd asked for the shirt odd his back. Turns out they had a caste system for loaner cars. I drive a lowly S60 and an S60 is all the loaner car I'm entitled to. God forbid a lowly S60 owner sully the steering wheel of the XC90. After standing my ground and waiting for the snootysnark of a service advisor to go to the service manager I was allowed to drive a loaner car (THAT I HAD RESERVED) waaaay above my station in life. Save yourself the disappointment. Go get yourself a 1974 Ford Pinto instead of this Volvo. At least you'll know up front what you're getting and you'd be throwing away about 42,000 fewer dollars.

volvo,s60,2015,Mark Martin, 07/26/2016,The Volvo S60 is a Hidden Gem!!!,5,"This car is amazing! It is a well built and great functioning car! I love the stop/start feature and I also love driving the car in sport mode. 240hp is more than enough power for a luxury sedan. I see so many BMW, Lexus and Audi cars on the road. I feel that those cars are over rated and who wants to drive down the street and see others with the same exact car as you and newer versions of your car everywhere you look? I know I don't. The car has outstanding safety ratings and it has amazing gas mileage and when I go to get my oil changed the staff is upscale and professional. I also checked this model and year and there are currently no recalls. Many of the BMW, Lexus and Audi cars end up on the NHTSA website.

volvo,s60,2015,brithume, 01/30/2016,Cheap & Tires Are Dangerous,1,"Like another reviewer, we have have several flat tires in one year. We have two S60s and it's the same problem with both. After 12,000 miles, the tire lights came on and wouldn't go off when we put in more air. I brought it into Volvo Service and was told it was a technology glitch and it was fixed. A week later, they were on again. I brought the car in again and now they're saying that we have to replace all four tires because they're so worn down. This makes absolutely no sense. We are in our 50's, are very safe drivers and drive the speed limits. This car is only a year old and Volvo wants $1000 for the new tires. Pathetic.

volvo,s60,2015,Valentina Deriabina, 09/05/2018,A very pretty tank,5,"Great car, great great great car! Super safe, very smart, reliable, great breaking, very good on the road. The only reason i am on this web site is that i did not negotiate my lease well enough and my lease payoff is way too high to keep my car. But over all this is my third Volvo, the previous was s60 2012 and it drove slightly different (they change the wheel to electric one on 2015) also 2015 is way more safer. It will get you spoiled in terms of standard safety features. The ones i personally use the most are: BLIS (blind spot aid), cross traffic (it's when you are pulling out of your parking spot and dont see the approaching cars in the isle - the car spots them and if needed automatically applies breaks), citi traffic feature is very useful too - it applied breaks a couple of times when my car approached another car too close in slow to semi-slow moving traffic. The seats are ... can i get one like those for my living room please? I drove about 10 times from DC to NY and back and never felt tired sitting in the car. Breaks are super, the car stops on a spot! the road handling is very good too - i feel safe in a rain or snow. However you need to be careful when there is a lot of snow - back in Snowmageddon of 2016 I was driving home when there was already about 3 inches of fresh snow on a road and car was swaying from side to side just a little bit. Having said that, navigation is horrible - routinely would tel me to make an exit from the left last second when i am in the far right line, or to save my money would take me back streets instead of the paid highway (even though settings set to the shortest route) (and that's exactly why, by the way, i ended up driving in 3 inches of snow back in 2016), or you will have to use that rotating knob to enter the address for about 15 minutes and then the system would tell you ""no such street"" or offer you another building. You will be better off using apple maps. Ride is a bit on a stiff side, but what do you want from the very cute tank? And that's exactly how I think of my car - it is a very cute, very smart tank with lots of babble wrap inside to protect me.  I am currently shopping around.  Audi A4 looks very dull compared to my car (everybody said the ride is much better, I tried Q3 - and its not THAT much better). BMW 300 series and merc C300 both drive nicer, but way more pricier and not as safe. XC-60 is just like my car, I feel totally home in it - but brakes are slightly weaker and headlights are not as good too. I mean, its a very very nice car, I have hard time being completely swept away by other cars in the same class. Cons: navigation sucks, slightly stiff ride, and apparently volvos in general depreciate very fast and loose value, so if i will get a new volvo - i am driving it to the ground. From the consumer reports reviews i know that 2015 is probably was one of the worst quality wise years (nothing major, just small stupid things that drove people nuts - like oil lamp is on, nothing wrong with the car, but its still on, stuff like that) but my car so far hasn't given me a second of grief. Also I have one of the prettiest combinations of black paint with red shine in it and light leather inside - so pretty!  I am sure will be sad to part with my car!

volvo,s60,2015,Karen, 03/22/2017,"Wow, Never had so many problems.",2,"I have owned many new and used cars, Audi, Lexus, Infiniti, Chevy, Hyundai.  I have never had so many problems with a car.  I leased this new Platinum Plus package S60 after less than one year it was in the shop.  I had the same problem twice with airbag sensors in the passenger seat, I was without my car for two weeks.  It is now in the shop for an engine rebuild.  This car as 30,000 miles on it.  I have 4 months left on my lease and I'm hoping Volvo will just buy it back now.

volvo,s60,2015,SE, 05/18/2016,First Volvo,5,"After multiple Japanese and American cars, this is our first venture in a European based car.  So far we are very pleased with our choice.  
Getting to consider the Volvo was due primarily to the very positive experience we had with the dealer group (Fields Automotive) while we owned our 2005 Infiniti G35 sedan.  That was a great car, but we were not enthused about staying with Infiniti (great driving experience, but expensive operating and maintenance costs).  Same group had a Volvo store and decided to check it out.  First impressions: clean design, interior and exterior (typical Euro/Scandinavian functionalistic, without being cold);  good driving experience: totally surprised by throttle response from the T5 engine, handling; visibility, and  comfort. Also appreciated that the tech interface was not the centerpiece of the dashboard like most new cars.  Good combination of actual buttons and knobs with screen controls.  Has a screen saver option, so the display goes dark after 20 seconds, instead of staring at you.  Looked at an Acura TLX 2.0 4-cyl (poor engine response, dash is way too busy) and a Lexus ES (nice car, still a Camry, and pricey).   So we went with the S60 (thought about the V60, but didn't need the extra room, and the sedan was a bit quieter).
We've only had it 4 months, but still very pleased. Good on the highway: plenty of power even at speed, quiet: some road noise, but not obtrusive.  City driving is relaxed.  Auto Stop/Start is a little weird at first, but you get used to it.  BLIS is great.   Back seat (which has been described as tight) has been totally comfortable for 2 adults.  Trunk has also been adequate for our needs.  Great gas mileage: 25/35 (which is tremendous coming from about 16 mpg on a good day). 
Only issue was the electric defrost built into the windshield, which comes with the Climate package.  Was very distracting: Volvo replaced at N/C with standard windshield.

Update:  Have had for about a year now.  Still very pleased.  Tires showing some early wear, but that seems to be the norm for the factory installed Continentals.


Update 12/21/18.  Now have about 38000.  Still a great car.

Volvo demonstrates no accountability to the owner at the dealer or higher level the when problems arise. Just a ""sorry"". Volvo cars used to be a solid service after sales oriented company, now they are completely focused on sales as evidenced in my case.

volvo,s60,2015,HD, 05/16/2018,If you have to get a mid sized sedan...,5,"This car is very comfortable and easy to drive. I miss my turbo C30 which was much peppier and way better looking in my opinion, but it was time for a grown up car that was refined yet affordable. I would say this fits the bill nicely and in a few years I will spring for the V60 wagon or XC60 crossover, since I prefer them both to a sedan. I wish I could have got the adaptive cruise control, but I would have had to go up a trim level to platinum and didn’t want to spend the additional $5k for the cars that were available with this option. Too early to say much about reliability but I’m hoping for the best. Road noise is not bad and the ride is nice. Not too cushy and not too tight. The stereo sound sucks but the Bluetooth works seamlessly. The interior is attractive with good quality materials, although I’m not in love with the colors and displays directly above the steering wheel. I like floating center panel. This car definitely does not make me want to race anyone at the stoplights. It does make me look and feel like a responsible adult which was necessary for my line of work. I guess the fuel economy helps make up for the lack in go go juice. This car has been very reliable this far. Approaching 100,000 miles on the odometer and the only money I’ve spent is normal maintenance with the exception of a broken trunk latch. This minor repair was rather expensive!

volvo,s60,2015,Silly Ghost, 12/20/2017,I never want a luxury vehicle again,2,"I have a 2015 that I got used last year and just keep sinking money into it even though I take it in for its regular maintenance and oil changes. Keep in mind that if you own a Volvo, the clip in your gear shifter is almost guaranteed to break. Mine already did at 2 years old and I don't do anything different than I did with my Jeep Cherokee. Before owning my S60 all I ever wanted was a Cadillac, but now the last thing I want in the world is a luxury vehicle. Unless you have extra cash laying around don't buy a Volvo. Its all hype."
volvo,s60,2015,montez, 05/02/2019,Nice....but,4,"I owned a Volvo C30 prior to this car which sadly had an early demise thanks to some road debris. I loved that car and since it had been discontinued I thought the S60 AWD was a good choice. I love the car but hate the handling on older pavement. It tends to ride down the road like a train rocking back and forth and can be difficult to control without 2 hands firmly on the wheel. When I purchased the car I noticed it had been in the shop several times for tire issues, new tires and alignments within 10 or 15 thousand miles. I bought it with 31k at 36 months.  I had it aligned just a few weeks ago, after 7k miles since the last alignment, and the rear alignment was out. This helped but the car still does not handle the way I would expect. I own 2 other all wheel and one 4x4 which none handle this poorly. Not sure whats up or if this is just an issue with this car. Tires are Continental high end and have about 70 percent tread left.

Was told that it had one owner prior that was meticulous about it. Seemed like an ok car while I had it a whole 5 months. The engine ended up blowing and had very oil without letting me aware of the low oil. Brought it back to the dealership and no cause for the low oil was found. The awful part was I wasn't even due for my first oil change yet. Volvo has done nothing about this issue and the dealership did nothing except offered to put a used engine in for $5000.

Local Volvo dealer has been great to work with and has done all the routine maintenance on the vehicle included with the purchase. Tires could have lasted a bit longer, but provided good grip and drivability. This is our second S60, first one was a leased 2012 which convinced us to buy the 2015.

volvo,s60,2015,Tim, 08/12/2018,Very good decision,4,"You get a lot for your money with this car. If you want something different, reliable, safe, fairly sporty based on how you outfit it, you’ll be happy with your purchase. Top notch materials, sensible, well organized instrument panel. I stepped up to the 19” rims and two tone leather interior because I could get more for less than some of the German sedans I was looking at. I had an Audi and a MB prior to this car and quality is on par even if name is not. I will be getting the newer 2019 version.
2/2020 Update: I still have the car and am pleased with my decision. The car is reliable and a pleasure to drive. I haven't purchased the newer version yet because I really am quite happy with this car. If it weren't for the navigation system and having to pay $200 a year for Volvo On Call (nope, didn't buy it), I wouldn't even consider a car for another 60,000 miles. We have a Honda Accord Hybrid that is 2 years newer, but the nav and connectivity makes my Volvo system feel like a first generation Commadore 64.

So I have purchased and it has all the features I wanteds, BLIS, backup camera, navigation, sunroof.  .  
Things I do like:
1.  Power.  Plenty of power to zip in and out of traffic.
2.  Handling.  Surprisingly good.  Not BMW 3 series like, but definitely great especially for being FWD.
3.  Seats.  Wow.  very comfortable seats.
Things I don't like:
1.  No spare tire.  Volvo the safest car in the world and yet if you get a flat, you are screwed. I purchased a full spare size tire and put in the trunk.  So my trunk space is scarce.
2.  Stiff ride.  Feels every bump I go over.  Not forgiving at all.  Thought Volvo is safe and comfortable car.
3.  If I lock the car with a keyfob, I cannot unlock with hand touch to the door handle.  I must use the keyfob to unlock.

volvo,s60,2016,Paul Raine, 12/03/2015,2016 S60 Inscription Platinum tight & fun to drive,5,"I'm a week into ownership of my new Volvo S60 Inscription Platinum and I'm VERY happy so far!  Volvo does front seats better than anyone in my opinion; these are sculpted and amazingly supportive in beechwood/black leather. The feel of the car is luxurious, tight, quiet and cocoon-like but it gives you a sense of being in touch with the road and very much in control. Consumer Reports recommends this car and says reliability is ""better than average."" This trim line comes with  an excellent Harmon Kardon stereo with 12 speakers, LOADS of safety features and electronics; my car insurance went DOWN 25% due to Volvo's safety record! 

The lighting throughout the cabin--which is very important to me--is really nice...with foot well lights front and back and lots of little ambient lighting touches throughout. The center console storage area feels small to me and is a little too vertical in comparison to my last car. The car feels welcoming and calming inside with its beautiful Scandinavian design cues and subtle luxury touches. This car has the extra 3"" wheelbase and therefore backseat room which is really nice. It feels sporty and nimble and can take corners quickly without a squeal but isn't a sports car per se. 

I shopped Audi A4, Lexus 250, BMW 328 and Volvo felt like the best overall choice for me in European sport sedans. (Most striking to me was that the current A4 was rated ""poor"" in one critical IIHS front collision test!) The Volvo trunk is spacious. This car comes with intelligent cruise control, backup camera, parallel parking assist, Volvo's BLIS system, keyless entry, fold-up outside mirrors, home link, navigation and mine has the 19"" alloy wheels with big Pirelli tires. I will check in again in six months and hopefully still be as happy then as I am now with my S60.

UPDATE: Six months in, I am still very glad I got my S60 Inscription! It is quick, nimble, very comfortable to drive in city & on the open road. The safety systems are superb & work exactly as designed! The radar-controlled smart cruise control amazes me every time I use it & the sensors front & rear and side-to-side make any parking pickle a breeze. And those industry-leading Volvo front seats do not disappoint. Awesome audio, too. 
The only small complaints I have are: some creaking in the interior on the rear right side of the cabin (although no squeaks or rattles of any kind) and I find that the wiper/washer/headlight washer system sprays excessive amounts of windshield spray which doesn't drain off the car properly & requires numerous wiper swipes to clear. All things considered, I would definitely buy Volvo again.
"
volvo,s60,2016,Jack, 10/08/2016,A hidden gem in entry luxury cars,5,"Owned the car for over two months now and my experience is extremely positive.
I was looking for a car that is comfortable, safe, quiet, powerful enough yet with great fuel economy at the same time.  
I researched various cars like new Accord touring, Acura TLX, 2017 Audi A4, Bentz C300, Lexus IS350 and S60 Inscription. I narrowed it down to Volvo S60 inscription and Audi A4.  After test drive, the Volvo S60 Inscription stands out to be my top choice: it has the most head room for me and it is easily one of the smoothest to drive at all speed range. Standard features include leather interior, HD radio,  rear window sunshades, city safety and glass sun roof etc.
Exterior
The 18"" titanium wheels look handsome and provide very good ride quality. The tall roof line makes entering and existing the car extremely easy. The car looks small from outside while roomy inside.
Interior
High quality leather seats, simple yet elegant color combination is pleasant to my eyes. 
The sit position is more upright compared to other cars, together with excellent all-round support and wide adjustment range from the seat as well as from the steering wheel, easily provide the most comfortable experience among all the cars I've tested. The silk metal trim gives solid and luxuries feeling, the steering wheel has the perfect size, it feels really good in hands.
Driving
I own a Honda accord and my first impression driving the S60 is that the cabin is whisper quiet, much quieter than my Honda. The acceleration feels like a powerful V6,  the S60 feels very solid on road. It does not have much body roll when making turns, at the same time it filters uneven road surface nicely.
Safety features
Safety feature includes the ability to stabilize the car in case of a flat tire; also good space between the front bumper and the radiator that can reduce damage in case of low speed accident (There is a sticker on the rear window of the passenger side that indicates the car's rear and front bumpers are designed to withstand 3 miles/hour hit limit, which exceeds the standard 2.5 mile/hour limit, which result in no structure damage and minimum bumper damage that can be fixed easily ); the city safety triggered once when a biker cuts in front of my car when my car was moving slowly, nice!
Entertainment
I loaded all my music collections on to a USB stick and plugin to the USB port in center console. The album name, album photo and track names are displayed on the LCD screen. I can now enjoy the high quality music on my daily commute.
Overall the S60 inscription is an elegant car that meets all my requirements, it provides an extremely well balanced experience that makes the daily drive a true joy.
Update (11-19-2016):
The combined MPG is now 29.4 at 3316 miles, compared to 28.4 at 1800 miles, my daily commute includes mountain road with  a lot of up and downs. 
Started to use the front seat heating feature as it is pretty cold now in the morning. I can feel the heat in less than 10 seconds. I hope the steering wheel could also be heated.

volvo,s60,2016,Mike C, 09/06/2016,"150 miles a day, pure bliss",5,"I justified this purchase (to myself and mostly my wife!) based on safety - Volvo's reputation for crash protection and all of the safety technology that comes with the car.  On the technology front, I simply don't want to drive anything else now (haven't driven my wife's Touareg in months - anytime we go out together, it's in the Volvo).  The adaptive cruise control has more than once alerted me to stopped traffic on I75 outside of Atlanta, and applied the brakes sooner than I would have by myself.  Combine the adaptive cruise with the blind spot detection, and it's like having a very competent copilot with me on every drive.  The cross-traffic alert is also very helpful - scans for people or moving vehicles as you are backing up and sounds an alert.  Ride comfort is a 10/10.  Incredibly comfortable leather seating and solid, quiet ride.  Reliability has been outstanding so far - I just passed the 20K mark with zero problems.  This is an outstanding car that I highly recommend.  I have owned a lot of vehicles including a 3 series, and none compare to this vehicle.  Hoping to get 200K out of it over five years, and so far I am VERY happy with my decision to buy this car.

volvo,s60,2016,Jennifer Jones, 08/06/2018,I thought I was buying a safe car.,2,"I leased a 2016 model in December of 2015 from Herb Gordon Volvo in Silver Spring, MD.  It was my plan to buy the car after the lease was up.  Everything was going well.  I serviced my car as required.  The problems began after two years in 2018.  My car began saying ""High engine temperature.  Turn engine off."" I took it to the dealership and they topped off the coolant.  Simple enough.  They didn't even write a ticket.  In early January, the same thing occurred. January 26th, the same thing the car continues to say the same thing.  They checked the blue tooth for proper contact.  February 8th, after bringing the car in again, the thermostat housing was replaced.  In February, same issue, the low fuel pressure sensor was replaced.  Towards the end of March, it began saying ""High engine temperature. Stop Safely"".  At this point, I was not allowed to accelerate the gas.  This occurred on the beltway in Washington, DC area in the midst of traffic! The water pump was replaced on April 9th.  At this point, I no longer wanted the car.  The last thing I want to happen is for the car to stop on me in the middle of the road/highway, risking my life, perhaps the lives of others in the car and/or countless others around me.  I expressed my concern to volvo and was told they could not replace the car or get me out of the contract.  On April 23rd, the car was brought in again and was fixed for the same problem.  I was told the car could be exchanged, but only if I took on a new lease.  My lease was up at the end of the year. The car was brought in again April 27th. After over two months on July 21st, the car was returned to me after being with the dealership for about a month.  It received a brand new engine.  On Friday, July 27th, the car was returned because it said, High engine temperature. Stop Safely"" and ""High Engine Temperature.  Turn off Engine"".  (Remember the car always says this) At this time, the engine wouldn't let me go over 17 mph in the middle of DC traffic.  Although three months of my lease was returned from the Volvo company. (they initially only wanted to give me one or two), all I want is to feel and be safe driving a car from one location to the next.  This is not what I feel in my Volvo, nor is it something that Volvo (the company or the dealership) is willing to give me.  Volvo, the car company supposedly known for safety, is not keeping me safe.  They continue to put me in the same car.

volvo,s60,2016,Randy, 07/27/2016,I love this car,5,"I've had my S60 Inscription (with all the bells & whistles) for a month now.  I owned a 2004 S60 for many years which I enjoyed.  But this 2016 Inscription car I love.  The extra 3"" make a huge difference - especially in the back seat.  My kids (full grown) even commented on how much room they had.  Truth is it's taken me most of the month just to learn how to work all the technology.  I love the adaptive cruise control and use it every day.  The safety features (lane keeping aid, collision warning, etc) alone make it worth it.  And being able to use regular gasoline is a big plus.  Bluetooth connectivity to my phone is wonderful. The system text-to-voice system reads incoming texts to me and I then ask Siri to respond to them.  Built-in USB port in the console just makes sense.  Oh, and the dealership (Keystone Volvo) was fantastic.  They advertise ""No hassle, no hype"".  I didn't believe the ads before.  Now I do.  Terrific experience.  The only possible change I'd like to see in future versions is a larger display but that will always be true.  One other thing - I should have taken advantage of the free trip to Sweden to get my car from over there.

volvo,s60,2016,HR, 08/02/2016,Volvo for life!,5,"This is my thirdS 60 and I have loved them all. The safety features are outstanding, especially the back up camera, front and side cameras and blind spot indicator. For a four cylinder, the S 60 has terrific pickup especially when merging. Gas mileage is OK around town but excellent on a highway trip. The back seat is a bit tight but I hardly have back seat passengers. The S60 is the perfect size car for me. It's only drawback is the time consuming, difficult to use navigation. I have given up on it and use my phone for this purpose.
"
volvo,s60,2016,Steve, 05/04/2016,A great entry level luxury car,4,"Comfort, quiet and a silky smooth ride, the S60 is the epitome of a quality commuter car.  Back seats a bit tight but front seats are firm.  Materials are high quality, even the plastic parts.  Electronics suite is somewhat confusing and difficult to navigate.  Acceleration and braking are more than adequate.  The most gentle highway driving will yield maybe 33; there is no way you will ever achieve 37.

volvo,s60,2016,Richard S'Dao, 08/15/2016,Love my new 2016 S60 Inscription,4,"This is my second S60 after owning a 740il & LS 400 for many years. My first S60 was a T5 AWD 5 cylinder. Liked that car but drawbacks were a bumpy ride and limited backseat room.  The 2016 Inscription 4 cyl Drive E I'm now driving is fabulous. Better riding vehicle due to the longer wheel base and  much more comfortable & spacious backseat. The upscale interior and electronics in the Inscription model makes this feel more like a luxury car, not a car I'm paying $300/month to lease.   I went with a 24 month lease but having regrets I didn't go for 36!  That's how much I've been enjoying this car.

volvo,s60,2016,Chuckgap, 07/16/2016,Two weeks and I was sold!,5,"I sold my beloved 2006 Acura TSX after spending 2 years researching replacements (I am on the 10 year plan).  Looked at MB C  class, Audi 4. BMW 328, Mazda 6.  All had their strong points but I settled on a Volvo S60 Inscription.  Did not need the extra back seat room but sedans are hard to find in the platinum edition and I the deal was hard to pass by.  At first I questioned my decision but now appreciate the vehicle and highly recommend it.  No, it will not blow off your socks but it will move out.  The bells and whistles are awesome.  Cars, like dogs reflect their owners  and if you are looking for a good value, great safety features and performance for majority of us, you cannot go wrong with this vehicle.  Plus is uses 87 octane!  That is a huge money saver!  Eight months in now and no issues!  Have owned my Volvo almost 4 years and it is a rock. No rattles.  Highly recommend it.  Must admit the infotainment system is a challenge and not intuitive.

volvo,s60,2016,Chuck, 10/18/2016,Volvo is like a magnet,5,"I looked at many different makes and models to replace my '03 S60/AWD.  This is now my 3rd Volvo, and they are like magnets, meaning I just cannot get past all the good points about the car.  Same reliable drivetrain as my '03, which just turned 220k.  Interior has attention to detail, and is very comfortable.
The electronics are not that complex, and gas milage is actually better than my older one.  It is tight and quiet.  Back seat not a big issue, otherwise Inscription may have been an option.  I am very satisfied with this car so far.

volvo,s60,2016,Lisa, 04/13/2020,Regarding over heating warning,5,"I recently purchased a 1 owner used 2016 Premier model from a search on cargurus & after a couple weeks (and after only driving it twice) I too got a large overheating warning message in the middle of my display. Since I had just bought it, I called the used car dealer (not a Volvo dealer) & because he was over 2 hrs away, he told me to take it to a garage & have it checked out. The local foreign car shop told me the water pump was bad & that I needed a new engine. I was devastated, cause I really liked the car. When I called the dealer I bought it from, he said that can't be possible & asked me to take it to a Volvo dealer. I made an appt & went in & waited while they checked out the car. The mechanic came out & to my relieve told me that I didn't need a new engine. The problem was that the coolant is under a vacuum system & someone must have broke the vacuum & an air bubble was created in the coolant system, which caused the coolant not to flow freely. So he withdrew the coolant & put it back in under pressure to create a vacuum. He also said the coolant was a half a gallon short, so he knew that whoever had filled it last had not done it correctly. It's only been a couple weeks, but no more messages about the coolant being low or the car over heating. The dealer I bought it from was happy to pay for both diagnosis. I won't be bringing my car to the local foreign car garage, because he right out lied to me. He said he could see the coolant leaking out of the head gasket. I found that hard to believe cause it is parked in my garage and I couldn't see or smell any coolant. I'm glad I took it to the Volvo dealer near me and they knew what the problem was!! "

volvo,s60,2016,Carie Ann Jean, 07/04/2016,Very happy with our purchase.,5,"Kids are grown. Was time for us to buy a sedan and move on from the mini vans and suv's. I had been wanting a Volvo for some time. Went to test drive a used T5 with open mind to other options, if price was right. Wound up comparing the 5 cylinder, AWD (used) to the 4 cylinder Front WD (new). Both cars felt very similar in handling, pick up etc. The better gas milage of the new, 4 cylinder won us over. Got a great deal at our local dealership. Super thrilled with our purchase. A couple minor disappointments. No standard back up camera. We were very used to this option and are considering putting one in. Trunk space is quite an adjustment. Half of a decent grocery trip winds up in the back seat. Other than that, I am a happy girl!!

volvo,s60,2016,s60 nightmares!, 12/14/2019,Nothing but problems,1,"I bought this car as a certified Volvo S60 inscription. I was beyond excited to get my first Volvo my excitement than turned into anger. I have owned this car for one year and purchased it with only 7000miles on the vehicle at time of purchase. Owned the car for approximately 2 months and when I was at a stop light the auto start feature was activated. I went to accelerate at a stop light and the vehicle would not move. It was in drive acting like it was in park. Took it into the dealership and of course couldn’t find anything wrong but decided to do a update on the transmission. This same issue continues to happen over the next year taken it to the dealership only to find of course no issues because there was no check engine light to be found to diagnose a error. While waiting in a drive thru lane this happened as well to my husband. He was stuck! He floored the car and the engine is on but the vehicle will not move until you put it in park and hit it off and turn it on again. Safety is not here! I unfortunately drive a lot for my work and will be getting rid of my car shortly. 

Beyond these issues, I too have had my tires spontaneously explode while driving 3 times with less than 15,000 miles on the car. I have had issues with the Bluetooth connection while on calls no one being able to hear me. Radio cutting out and screen going black. Error code for wind screen system.  This car is beyond loud at an idle. 

Done with this car and probably Volvo!

volvo,s60,2016,Lunacharsky, 06/06/2020,My Best Car Ever,5,"This S 60 does everything well. It's the most comfortable seating I've ever experienced in a car. It has  plenty of pickup and you hardly feel it or hear when the turbo kicks in. It handles very well, esp in sport mode, which I use going through mountain roads here in Southern California."
volvo,s60,2017,wbm, 02/21/2017,S60L - China Rules!,5,"This is the first major Chinese car exported to the USA- I got the S60 Inscription, Platinum from Princeton Volvo.  We were looking for a car for long trips up to Canada that is both comfortable and fuel efficient.  I looked at Lexus, Audi and VW cars (we had a Honda, and had a bad reliability experience with the Mercedes E320 wagon).   The Audi is more quiet, but has a smaller interior with a smaller fuel tank - for long trips we really appreciated both the larger cabin, and the good fuel mileage.  We recently did 1000 miles up to Canada and back and can testify that the car performed very well.  Our son was comfortable in the back reading - in the Honda he got motion sickness.   In particular, while some journalists do not like the adaptive cruse control, I found it fantastic - once one gets use to using it, it makes long drives on moderately busy freeways much much more enjoyable and stress free.  The S60L has a longer wheel base which reduce handling, but increases stability - the car performed perfectly on busy highways with large trucks that can blow a car around.  Many journalists complained about the lack of a touch screen - I strictly preferred the S60 to both the S90 and Audi A4- the navigation screen is perfect - I find the heads up display very distracting, and once one gets the hang of it, the S60 system is efficient - the hardest thing to do is enter an address, but with Volvo on call this is easy - find the address on ones phone and then send to the car. The negatives are the following - small trunk - holds about 4 roll-ons plus a bit  - we got the spare tire that reduces trunk space (which for long trips is something we value - being stuck on a highway with a flat at 2am is not great).  Second, one can put a Class 2 hitch for a bike rack or cargo carrier, but for the moment there are no roof racks for the Inscription - Rhino Rack says they may do them in the future, but Thule (and hence Volvo) says they will not do them - so I would not recommend the car for a family that needs more space - with roof racks and a cargo box, the car could be a good family car - large cabin plus comfortable, but precise ride.  Finally, the car can use regular gas, but 89 octane gets 12% better mileage, so we will use that going forward. Overall, we would get the same car again, unless there is a V60 Inscription, which would solve the lack of cargo space, while giving more cabin space.

Update August 2018:  Our initial impressions have not changed much.  The following seemingly small issues would probably lead me to buy a different car this time:
1. Headlights are not great - it would be nice to have running lamps - I have these on my other car and have found that they do improve driving in the fog and snow.  Volvo used to have these, but no longer.
2. We did use the spare on the way to the airport and so it saved us from missing a flight - wish they would make more room for a spare.  
3. Still no rack for the car.  Really irritating, especially if  one skis.   I put a hitch on for a bike rack that I do us frequently, and had a wiring harness put in for towing - Volvo does not support these, so it was after market.  
4. Windshield wipers are not very good, and given the unusual specs I could not find an aftermarket pair that would do better.

Overall, it is a nice car, but for the American market Volvo really seems to want to force people to large gas guzzler's for car's that have utility features .  A sedan is great for day to day driving, and the extra room in the back is very nice.  However, for holidays one would like more usability features - overhead rack, better wipers, better lights.  In the theory the cross-country is suppose to cover these, but then why the small back seat? The longer Inscription is a definite improvement.

I enjoy having peace of mind when I am on the road. Love to travel and it is good to have peace of mind. I wanted something bigger, but it's me alone most of the time.  So I got another S60.  The sales associate Ingrid was there through the process and was helpful and not pushy, we had a good footing from the introduction.  Made the sale go smoothly almost effortless.

volvo,s60,2017,DG, 10/26/2018,First Volvo,5,"I bought the S60 Inscription to replace a Toyota Camry. I test drove several vehicles and ended up falling love with the Volvo due to it's classy interior and spacious back seat. While not a sports car it drives and handles well, and does everything I ask of it. These are the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in. They make it a pleasure driving this car. I am not crazy about the keyboard on the console, and I wish the dash was leather, but overall I am quite pleased. The trunk is a little small, but I also realize the spaciousness of the back seat is the plus here. I do like al of the safety features, and love having a back up camera and blindside sensors. I also like the wet sensor windshield wipers. I like the technology of the car. I think it has an adequate sound system, and the computer is easy to use once you become accustomed to it. My only qualm is the navigation system. It isn't easy to use, and you can't do a split screen of that and the radio. I have had no issues with the car thus far (6 months in) and the fuel economy is even better than advertised.

volvo,s60,2017,J. Rebele, 10/29/2017,Still regret buying this car,2,"This is my second Volvo S60.  I currently own a 2017 S60 Inscription model.  I did not realize that Inscriptions are made in China, not Sweden. My first drive on the highway revealed an air-leak noise when the car gets to about 60 MPH.  The dealer has attempted to fix this problem without success.  We drove another Inscription model vehicle; same noise.  The wind noise is very loud, so this is not a minor issue.  The dealer discussed problem with Volvo in an attempt to get me out of this vehicle and into a different car (Dynamic model).  Volvo refused to do anything, claiming that the noise is a ""characteristic"" of the vehicle.  Ridiculous response, as this noise should not be found in a $40K+ vehicle.  I have about 4,000 miles on the car and I am looking to get rid of it.  Anyone thinking of buying an S60 Inscription model should drive it on a highway getting to at least 60 MPH.  Not a normal part of a test drive, but advisable for the Inscription.  You will likely buy a different car.  I wish I had.   I now have about 23,000 miles on the car, and the ""wind"" noise and rattle under dash are still my driving companions.  Volvo has done nothing to fix either problem.  I am currently looking to trade the car.  I'll take a loss, but life's too short to drive this Volvo.

volvo,s60,2017,Dave - Northern, NJ,S60 was the right choice.,5,"I had not really considered a Volvo, let alone an S60, but living in the north eastern United States we needed an AWD vehicle.  I was only considering a sedan as my wife already had an SUV.  We were initially looking at the obvious German choices, but I was not a fan of the interior's and somehow we ended up at a Volvo dealer and when I sat in the car it literally felt like it fit like a glove.  The seats are amazing, the interior had a beautiful cockpit design for the driver and it was visually a beautiful interior.  While it is not a sports car, it drives very well, great acceleration, tight turning radius, it is both fun and pleasurable to drive.  Initially I thought the small trunk would be an issue, but as it turns out my family of 3 can put everything we need for a long ski weekend in the car with room to spare.  I did end up purchasing a few accessories, we added the factory roof rack for our skis, it fits perfect, no modification needed, added the glasses holder, the factory all weather floor mats and such.   What really surprised me was how comfortable the car is on long drives and how fuel efficient it was.  The stereo sounds fantastic.  On the flip side, it is a stiffer ride quality than I was expecting on local roads and the navigation is a little cumbersome, outside of that we love the car.

volvo,s60,2017,Paul M, 11/20/2017,Beware Volvo's City Safety System,2,"I purchased a new S60 for many reasons-- the most compelling being the City Safety System.  This was my fourth Volvo.  All of the ads on this feature made me wonder how I or my family could drive without it.  A month after purchase, a man slammed on his brakes in front of me when a child went into the crosswalk (not dissimilar to the TV commercial).  My car not only didn't stop but didn't even slow down and rear ended the vehicle in front of me.  How could this happen when I had City Safety?  I sent a letter to the President of Volvo and was routed to customer service.  They sent a technician to check the ""black box"" and let me know the system worked just fine.  Read the fine print in the owners manual, they told me.  City Safety really only works in certain condition and the advertising is not accurate.  In other words, they mistake is yours.  You trusted us.  Volvo makes a just fine vehicle -- but this feature does not work.  #VolvoSafetyFail

volvo,s60,2017,GD, 12/02/2019,Should I buy the lease?,5,"I had developed a hip pain about three years ago, likely from driving my Porsche Boxster but also was there, to a lesser degree, with the daily Hyundai driver. I took out about 10 makes from Audi to Honda to Mercedes etc. to find a comfortable ride. Taking out the Volvo S60Dynamic AWD was a revelation. Not only did the pain not materialize, but the seat and drive was very comfortable as well as engaging on a country road. The interior and exterior were attractive and its low key demeanor doesn't scream for attention. During the past 33 months, I've learned many interesting things about the vehicle. On a summer road trip to NJ in traffic the Volvo averaged 36-40 mpg @ 50-60 mph. The adaptive HID headlights are excellent for an older driver on a country road at night, where night vision isn't what it used to be. It is an excellent ski companion for a couple with AWD on snow covered roads with its ski tunnel and enough space for luggage and gear. The clincher was 2 weeks ago, when driving a back road after dark when tired, my concentration wandered and I had to emergency brake when the car in front of me stopped to turn w/o signalling. The car went into City Safe and stopped 2 feet from the back bumper. I thought it was a rear ender for sure. That was the clincher. I've decided to buy the Volvo and name her Inga.

volvo,s60,2017,Geosat1, 03/31/2018,Girly gripe from a guy!,4,"What? only two cup holders! What? no change holder!  Recently purchased this car in Fort Worth TX and drove it to my home in Cocoa, FL (yes I got a great deal.) Gave the car a good workout in heavy rains, little rain, and dangerous I95 s. I found the car to have have excellent acceleration and fuel economy around 30 mpg without ECO engaged.  Minor complaints I know, but the center panel has a primitive design. So much wasted space with hidden space pass through and a primitive shifter with no paddles. Should have a rotary shifter which would allow for many more things even my tiny 1.5 liter Ford had them creating a much more space. Also has a less than intuitive SENSUS system, don't get me started on that one! Overall peppy performance and very safe vehicle two of the primary reasons for purchase.

volvo,s60,2017,SSI-GA, 03/21/2020,3-Year Lease Retrospective - A Very Balanced Car,5,"This is truly a very well-balanced car.  The exterior and interior design are classy and have aged well.  The interior quality held up very well over the past 30,000 miles and it still looks new.  The ride, handling, and steering all strike a nice balance between comfort and sportiness.  I have had no reliability issues to speak of, and my overall MPG for the life of the car, based on the in-car computer, is 33 MPG combined.  Very impressive.  Contrary to an earlier review, this car is extremely quiet at highway speeds, no wind noise.  The standard sound system is very good.  One thing I appreciate about this car, especially in light of most new cars,  is that it has actual buttons and knobs for all major functions such as the radio and climate controls.  I am not going to lease another S60 because I find the touchscreen system too distracting.  The only real criticism I have of this car is the lack of storage.  You get two cupholders and that is pretty much it.  Nowhere for a phone, wallet, keys, etc, other than those two cupholders.  Overall, a very well-balanced, premium car that is comfortable and fun to drive, delivers well above average fuel economy, and has a timeless, classy design.  Not too bad.

volvo,s60,2017,K Breslin, 08/31/2017,Nice vehicle but not at par with other Euro sedans,4,"For the most part, it's a nice car with good performance and mostly good features.  Fun to drive and pretty good economy but it requires Midgrade (89 octane).   The issues thus far after 1 month are mostly annoyances rather than problems. Navigation does not seem to update traffic or construction. Dual-zone climate controls have no sync option. Exterior door handles are pinchy (watch your fingers or you'll be sorry).  The AT&T Wi-if is almost useless and difficult to setup with very, very slow speeds.  The menu system is NOT intuitive and to make matters worse, the manual is not applicable to the actual options in the menu system (e.g. There is no ""My car"" category in the menu system, which is frequently referenced in the manual).  The visors are not extendible so you have no way to block sunlight coming through the side windows (heck, even cheap Fords offer this).  The tire pressure system only tells you if you have a low tire.  No specific info as to which tire is the problem or how low it is.  No PSI display for the tires (again, even very modest vehicles offer this feature) however it does for some reason have a ""calibration"" process for the tires. Seats are a bit stiff and not great for long trips.  Bluetooth connection is iffy and sometimes does not connect with phones.

Karleen Byrnes was once again our sales person, her patience along with Mike Theisen's generosity and willingness to get us back into Volvo's was nothing short of outstanding.  The cars are pure genius and joys to drive, the fit and finish, those seats!, new technology and outstanding smooth engine just takes the cake.  We managed excellent savings and were fortunate to capture King of Sweden sign and drive month.  More importantly we are back with a brand that's part of our soul.  And once our lease ends in a few years, we have the peace of mind knowing we WILL go back to Kline Volvo.  ps....the dealership has been remodeled,.............IT'S GORGEOUS!

volvo,s60,2017,Jim (Upstate NY), 06/29/2020,Low end luxury?,5,"Bought used, low mileage, traded in a 2014 I wish I'd kept.  Why?  Because of the (supposed) engine turn-off every time I stop.  Tried it with the turn-off engaged and with the turn-off disengaged.  Didn't notice any difference in mpg's so now I just turn it off.  Next ""luxury"" vehicle will have all the bells and whistles this one lacks i.e. back-up camera, lane turning warning, blind spot warning.  That's what buying a ""near luxury"" car does to you.  Makes you hungry for more. "

I had no problems with the car except a flat tire which was a pain since the car does not have a spare.  Driving wise you feel the turbo lag but after that you should be able to pass most cars.

The S60 is very fun to drive and has many great features. It truly does have amazing seats. I love the Sensus Nav system and radio. My complimentary “Safe and Secure” warranty ( because I was a prior VW owner) includes wear and tear items. Lastly, Volvo has really emphasized customer focused experiences and the Service staff is terrific. I am a very impressed by Volvo!

volvo,s60,2017,Kivanc Layton, 11/13/2017,Love this thing!,5,"I have owned a lot of european cars and this is honestly my first Volvo I have ever owned. Starting off with the fact that it is the only ""luxury sedan"" where you do not need to put premium gasoline in it. The seats are incredibly comfortable and I actually do have a lot of back problems and commute about 50-60 miles a day. The cabin is incredibly quiet and even the T5 has great acceleration. The trunk space is adequate however I do wish there was a tiny bit more room in the back. Materials on the interior are high quality and the car has no squeaks or rattles. I love the Volvo on call service I get and the app that controls it. Gas mileage is great and the car in general is an overall great car. The reliability of it is definitely better than my BMW I had and the Volvo is by far the most comfortable car I've owned.

volvo,s60,2018,Ted V, 08/04/2017,Very Good Car,4,"I am on my third S60 and have loved them all. My first S60 I owned and sold it in 2015 because my wife insisted on me driving a car with all the safety improvements. This brings me to one of the very few problems with the S60 and that is resale value. Like so many other cars nowadays my near perfect car with normal mileage was worth less than 50% on a trade. However the up to date safety features prevented me from two serious accidents so it was worth it. The car drives great. The comfort, quality feel, gas mileage and all the features work great. The only reason I ever go back to my dealer is for recommended maintenance. What I like about the S60 is I never feel bored driving it. I recently leased an end of year 2017 because the incentives to turn my 2015 in early were so sensational it made sense to do it. For the first time I got the Inscription model with the platinum trim. The extra legroom in the rear seat answered another issue with my two previous S60s. This is the best version I have had yet. The car now comes with an automatic shade for the rear window and manual shades for the two rear passengers. These are great to keep the kids cooler. This is a very good car.
"
volvo,s60,2018,RBentin, 04/05/2018,Great Buy,5,"The vehicle I purchased has a few add-ons such as BLIS, heated seats, and 19-inch wheels. Being a baby-boomer having driven for many years I originally felt the safety technology would be an unnecessary distraction and possibly an outright annoyance, but having driven the vehicle only 2,600 miles I'm sold on it. The blind-spot and cross-traffic alerts are unobtrusive and the auto-brake tends to be in-sync with my own braking habits. The few times the auto-brake has engaged have been within a fraction of a second before applying the brake myself. The interior materials are high quality and the fit-and-form are excellent. Little extras such as the entry/exit lighting and theater lighting while driving are nice touches that add to the luxury feel of the vehicle, as do the soft-touch premium leather seats. For audio buffs (as I am), the Harman-Kardon audio system is fantastic. While acceleration is strong and smooth when getting heavy on the accelerator the 8-speed transmission is a little disappointing on the lower end of the RPM scale. Under modest acceleration the transmission shifts prematurely (in my opinion) and gives the impression of ""lugging"" the engine. Accelerating somewhat strongly to avoid the feel of ""lugging"" the engine has thus far produced an average city/highway MPG of 31.4, which is all-the-more impressive being a ""green"" engine. The 19-inch diamond-cut wheels look great and provide excellent handling with little additional road noise but do enhance the impact of bumps and rough road surfaces, a price I was willing to pay for the great handling. Overall I would highly recommend the S60. Feature-for-feature and dollar-for-dollar the S60 is a wise and enjoyable alternative to a pricier Mercedes, BMW, or Audi.

volvo,s60,2018,John Rotante, 07/17/2018,Third time is the charm!,5,"I've driven Volvo S60's since I went to Sweden for the amazing Overseas Delivery Program in 2013.  Originally a T5 - 2.5 Cylinder turbo...and now with a more refined 2.0, AWD; and a real luxury feel in the Inscription model. The extra length loses about 10% of the sportiness of the shorter versions, but the solid value of understated elegance is quite apparent. And although I was expecting to move to the newer US model, my lease ran out and acquiring this 2018 iteration proves that Volvo's are getting better all the time!  It fits like a glove!

volvo,s60,2019,NG, 08/14/2019,"I loved my car, until I didn't.",2,"I purchased a 2019 Volvo S60 brand new and it has already been in the shop twice for multiple days (I had actually previously scheduled what would have been a 3rd appointment but ended up missing it). From the day I bought it, the media console was a bit glitchy. However, the first time I took it in was when the car died as I was switching lanes causing a ""service needed"" light to turn on. I took it in to Volvo, they had it for 2-3 days and told me that there was a computer system glitch where multiple signals went to the fuel tank at the same time, causing the car to die. They said they reset my computer system and that it would take care of 90% of problems (the other 10% was the rear suspension recall, which they fixed without prompting while it was there). I asked if they could guarantee the car wouldn't die again because it was a safety issue, and they said 98% guarantee. When I got the car back, I was still having issues with media console...mainly Apple CarPlay text features and radio volume issues so nothing major but still annoying. I scheduled an appointment, but ended up missing it, then a few days after, my check engine light came on. This is about a month (or less) after the car was in the shop the first time, and the vehicle currently has less than 4,000 miles on it. I haven't gotten the car back yet, but they said it will be in the shop for a minimum of 2 days and told me at the desk that it is likely a computer issue, again. The other bummer to me is that Volvo does not give Apples to Apples loaners like BMW (the other brand of luxury car I have experience with). They give you a voucher for Hertz (for which you have to pay a deposit). Last time, I was able to rent a Cadillac. This time, they put me in the crappiest, least equipped Toyota Corolla. 

I am so beyond frustrated and disappointed. My dad actually recommended Volvo to me and I really loved the car. I test drove BMWs and Audis before getting in this car, and I was just sold immediately after my test drive of this vehicle. The interior is just okay, but I love the look of this version of S60, I love the drive, I love the safety features, I love that it has just has enough power (I didn't want a sports engine but I wanted something with pick-up), it's comfortable, and I love the tech (when it works). Gas mileage is just okay and the trunk space is actually terrible (which would've been the biggest negative about the car), but overall, I was so thrilled with this vehicle that I was on board to be a Volvo enthusiast and my only ""regret"" prior to now was that I opted for the sedan over the SUV. I have now talked to multiple late-model Volvo owners (XC90's) who have both had to have their car replaced in the past and I keep getting told by sales that ""well this version of the car is brand new"" and ""any car can have computer issues"" as if that's an excuse. I've also read accounts of similar issues on forums pertaining to S60's from like 2016 on. I no longer have faith in this car brand and am just extremely disillusioned by this experience.

"
volvo,s60,2019,Paisa Surfer, 04/22/2019,The Total Package,5,"The all new S60 is a wonderful ride, satisfying and sure-footed.  So many features come as standard equipment that are only available as upgrades in its competitors (BMW 3 series, Audi A4, AR Giulia, MB C-class), like for example paddle shifters and blind spot monitoring. And the premium package includes equipment that would cost much more in the other brands.  

My wife and I traded in our 2017 S60 Inscription for this new R-Design, and this is her daily driver, so we can make a fair comparison to the prior model, which we think is a wonderful automobile.  What we notice first about the 2019 model is that Volvo listened to its owners and responded with greater attention to details, like for instance the seat memory buttons.  In the 2016, you would have to hold the memory button down while the seat moved to its position (yes, I know, a tedious First-World problem).  In the 2019, one press of the button and the seat re-positions (along with the mirrors), letting you do other stuff to get ready and going.  The stereo system (600 watts Harmon-Kardon with 14 speakers) is vastly improved and can stand up to just about any other sound system in the segment.  The leather seats and the bolstering are incredible and having nappa leather seating hands down is so much nicer than having the chemical odor of faux leather so pervasive in the BMW 3 and Mercedes C classes.  The T5 power plant is superb.  With butter smooth shifting, almost no turbo lag, and more than enough horses and torque to get up and go, the punchy response and acceleration will please most around town drivers--and the car MOVES gracefully on the highway. The S60 is not large, but feels solid and connected to the road at low and high speeds.  Comfort and interior styling get an A+.  A tall adult will fit fine in the back seat, having far more leg room than in the BMW 3 series and far more headroom than the MB CLA. The standard panorama sunroof is also a nice feature you won't find as standard equipment in the competition.  Even though some criticism has been raised about the large touch screen control interface, it is not an burdensome learning curve to become adept at interacting with the car.  Having both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also new standard features we really missed in the 2017 model.  We do not find the steering to be lackluster or detached from the road at all (as some critics have said), the car is whisper quiet, the suspension and 18 inch wheels soak up urban highways without an issues (also contrary to some reviews), and driver visibility and driving confidence are superb.  

If you are looking for a compact luxury ride (although it is hard to imagine the S60 as compact), we encourage you to put the S60 on your test drive list.  It is uniquely Volvo, like nothing else on the road, a driver's car while at the same time an executive's show horse.  Volvo has definitely arrived in the small luxury sedan line-up with a car that meets and exceeds the competition in so many ways.  This is a car that lets you run in the pack without running with the pack.

volvo,s60,2019,Chuck and Amy Mikell, 06/14/2019,South Carolina Jewel,5,"We went to buy a new Mercedes. The Mercedes dealer here is also a Volvo dealer. We test drove one Mercedes model before my wife saw the S60. It was all over after that. She LOVED the way it looked....inside and out.  I am 73 years old and have a bad back. The seats are the most comfortable I have ever sat in in an automobile. We have only had the car for a week so I can't speak to reliability. However, as South Carolina natives we are proud to drive a car made right here. Very, very nice car. I don't understand Edmund's comments about the technology. My wife is a technophobe, but she caught on to the infotainment and car controls right off. And she NEVER does that. it works just like a tablet. Did I mention the seats are real comfortable...

volvo,s60,2019,Stuart, 05/03/2019,Wow Just wow.,5,"I've owned lots of Volvos over the years, and this (along with the 2019 XC60 I leased a week earlier) is a fantastic vehicle. I was so impressed with the features of the XC60 that I went back to the dealer to test drive the S60, and within an hour traded in my 2015 Acura TLX for this car. I really like everything about it, and could not be happier with my decision. The safety features, the technology, the design, the spaciousness. There are times that it feels that I must have picked up the S90 by mistake, because there's a great sense of roominess inside Love the color too, Pine Grey with a Blonde/Charcoal interior. Very, very happy with my decision.

volvo,s60,2019,K, 02/27/2020,Great Buy,5,"When considering getting a new vehicle, I looked at Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Lexus, BMW, Audi, and Volvo. When I was testing out all of the vehicles, I personally thought the Volvo S60 R-Design was amazing. Starting with the exterior styling and the interior design. I have read many reviews complaining about the comfortably, technology, rough ride, and the r-design sitting too low... I have not had any issues with mine since purchasing it last September. The ride in an Audi is by far rougher than the Volvo. Technology has been easy to use compared to our Mercedes-Benz and Lexus. Seats are VERY comfortable and support your body. With it being an R-Design, yes it sits a little bit lower which I personally like. The only thing that I did not like was that there was no option to get blond interior which I got over. Great Buy for the cost.

volvo,s60,2019,Tommy, 06/20/2020,Very Good all around vehicle,4,"I have a T6 R design with polestar. It has virtually every package and option available. Love the tech, excellent mpg as I average around 25 in mixed driving and the car is beautiful inside and out. It’s surprisingly large, easily fits a medium 29er mountain bike with the rear seats folded down and the front tire removed. The reason for not giving 5 stars is it drives nice but lacks engagement. It’s hard to explain but the power is good, a little more in polestar mode, but never really feels truly powerful. The steering is pretty numb, almost like you’re driving something at Dave and Busters. The ride is really nice though and that’s on 19s. The other thing underwhelming is the Bowers and Wilkins sound system. It’s a $3200 option and not worth $500. It’s clear but that’s about it. Overall I love the car though. The driving aids work seamlessly and would definitely buy it again.

volvo,s60,2019,Luis Hernandez, 06/06/2019,My new favorite car a,5,"I absolutely love this car. Feels great on the road, very good power and the luxurious feel of the interior is very nice, so nice that when I now get into my boss’s BMW Alpina it looks plain. If there is one thing I will nitpick about the S60 is that the  button to start the car isn’t a button. In fact, it’s a knob that you turn to the right to start and stop the engine. I wish they would’ve stuck to a push button on the dash, but I’m just nitpicking at this point. One other thing, a few buttons for the climate control would’ve been nice, but whatever. The point is that the car glides and feels great on the road. When you need the power it is there and comes on quickly and smoothly. The car won’t push you back on your seat, but it gets up there rather quickly. Before this car I would lease a car and still think about my 2008 Infiniti G35 and reminisce on the good times I’ve had with it on the road. However, the S60 is now the car that has replaced that void I’ve had for my G35. I will always remember the good times with the greatest infiniti product made, but the Volvo S60 is the one I look forward to having fun with on the road, it is a wonderful machine and is the best in its class in my humble opinion.

volvo,s60,2019,MRush, 02/27/2020,2019 S60 T6,1,"I’ve recently purchased a 2019 S60 T6 which is a first model year of the new S60.  I am very happy with interior and exterior finish of the vehicle but my likes stop there.
The 2019 S60 T6 is built on the SPA platform with awd and the car has some serious vibration problems.  It is well documented online in Volvo forums, I am not sure if the T5 fwd suffers from the same issues.  On the T6 awd at about 75 mph the car vibrates and the ride is unpleasant, my work truck rides better than this car. Volvo has tried addressing the problem by balancing tires and replacing rims but the ride in this 45k automobile is unacceptable. There is also a Technical service bulletin about the Vibrations but from what I hear it does not correct the issue.
If you search online there are a lot of complaints on new Volvo SPA platform with vibration issues especially the awd vehicles."
volvo,s60,2019,Joel, 04/23/2020,Loving the S60 Second Time Around,5,"Our last car was a 2006 S60.  Great car, sold it with reservation to get the new one.  The 2006 had no mechanical issues; just regular maintenance as long as we owned it (165,000 miles).  One of the most spectacular things about the car was not a hint of rust after 13 Michigan winters - none.  We have experienced, and fully expect to continue to experience, great power, handling, styling and reliability from the new S60.  The AWD is incredible in the snow and ice.  Drove it 2,600 miles to FL and back and the seats amazed us.  The car makes driving enjoyable; a car that you look forward to getting into.  Absolutely nothing negative to share.

volvo,s60,2019,YP, 07/30/2019,"Disappointing, not per specs. Volvo doesn’t care.",1,"Was very excited about my S60. Before I share my routine ownership experience let me just tell you that my car is a lemon. It drinks gasoline as if it was a v16 Lamborghini. 15MPG city / 19MPG highway is not near acceptable. I have filled up 7’tankanin the past 1300 miles. This is NOT OK and Volvo is not responsive to my emails and calls after opening a complaint. Moreover they tried to blame my driving which is really adding insult to injury . I have been driving for 30 years and had far better fuel economy on some huge engine gas guzzlers. I use Eco Drive and Comfort modes, drive mostly alone without load, on normal roads, in a flat area, at average weather/humidity and near sea level elevation. I’m not an aggressive driver. Moreover, this is a T5 FWD and I drove an AWD T6 loaner for a few days being aggressive on dynamic mode, I couldn’t get it to take more than 22.4
MPG/City. Speaking to other 2019
S60 drivers confirms my car is off. I deserve better than being ignored. 
So now, review after 2 months ownership:
The S60 is stunning inside out, great seats too, lots of technology-actually too much half-baked technology. The ride is comfort is average but a bit noisier than I would imagine. The ride is a bit lazy, the car is heavy and does not accelerate anywhere near its prescribed specs. It is annoyingly wide but this may reduce the roll. Assembly quality is a bit sloppy and there are some materials that seem very cheap. Vinyl seating (didn’t opt for Napa
leather) is not perforated and gets scorching hot in the summer and very sweat provoking. It’s a bit disappointing as the seats have such superior support. The Sensus system is frankly annoying. Volvo is selling itself as the safety company but there is nothing safe about futzing with screen drama for every little thing. It takes about 12 clicks to switch to your favorite radio station and even changing the AC fan speed requires far too many clicks and focal attention. There is no tactile sense to anything so you really have to be a distracted driver or stop on the side of the road. I don’t know who these days buys Volvo navigation when Google/Waze are years ahead and are free but if you don’t buy Volvo’s navigation, expect 1/4 of your big screen to become a permanent announcement of your lack of service. Additionally, while excessive features like touchscreen-activated folding rear headrests are standard, simple fog lights are a huge add on. Safety first? I don’t think so. Also the car is glitchy with CarPlay, windows that open on their own in the middle of the night, false airbags alert (recall completed
For that), false alerts from the OnCall app that my light bulbs need changing and that my trunk is open. This is a gorgeously designed over-engineered half-baked machine or disappointing quality. Its safety flaws are hidden in its user experience. And the worst part about it is that Volvo couldn’t care less.
"
volvo,s60,2019,Kevin A., 12/29/2019,Worst car ever...,1,"I was seriously thinking of buying the 2019/2020 Volvo S60. For personal testing I rented one for 2 weeks. I am so happy that I rented one.

This is the crappiest luxury car ever. 

Good engine and drivetrain. Pretty fast pickup from stop, and that is all the good stuff.

Worst ergonomics, the driveshaft tunnel is way too high, no storage space other than two cup holders and are rear console/storage bin. 

Extremely frustrating touchscreen menus, not sure why Volvo went with tall touchscreen. Small width limits Apple CarPlay screen, and it is the smaller I have ever seen in modern cars. 

Worst yet, this is 2019 and this car has only one USB, just 1 in a freaking $50k car. Completely unacceptable.

Seating position is not good either, I don’t like to sit all the way down, And usually raise the seat few inches. After raising the seat, I started hitting my head while entering or exiting the car and my hair were running on the roof liner. I am 5’10” so it was disappointing to experience lack of headroom.

Poor visibility is another problem. Rearview mirror, front camera and passenger side A-pillar blocks 75-80% visibility on passenger side. This is very dangerous in urban environment while turning right when pedestrians might enter the intersection without warning.

Trunk space is limited. I was only able to fit two large size (28”) suitcases in the trunk. Absolutely no space left for anything else. With 2 adults and 3 kids, we had to be creative in packing for a 7 day, 2500 mile family trip. Very frustrating.

Half way in the trip, the lower engine cover fell dow and started rubbing in the road. Had to stop at closest Walmart and fix it using zip ties.

2 days later the Rear Left window trim piece came out and fell on the driveway while my daughter was raising the window :(

These are the things we experienced in 2 weeks. I am sure if we keep it longer we will find more stuff relating to poor workmanship, design and ergonomic.

I used to own a Volvo 960. The transmission went on it one day and the quote was $3500 to fix it. I sold after putting in a reconditioned transmission for $2200.

I thought Volvo quality might have improved in last 20 years, apparently not. 

Needless to say, I will not be buying/leasing or recommending any Volvo ever. Not worth the headache, frustration and my money.

volvo,s60,2019,Christopher , 12/04/2020,Love mine,5,"Got it used, warranty covered a few things out of the gate and couldn't be happier. Had a 2013 S60 RDesign platinum. So not as fast or sporty but gorgeous and love the Harman/Kardon sound system upgrade.. was horrible in my 2013. This one has deep rich bass, clarity & great 7.1 channel quantum logic surround sound. Nothing like BMW H/K (no volume/no bass/bad sounding old 5.1 ""logic 7"" surround sound) alfa H/K or any other for that matter. Clearly Volvo has worked with H/K to make it a worthy downgrade from the Bowers and Wilkins upgrade(which HK also makes and is hands down one of the best in car sound systems esp. In clarity and dynamic range) a HUGE upgrade from the base sound system.  Wish it had an extra helping of engine power without the polestar engine optimization 330hp/325lb-ft of torque stock then have the polestar upgrade bump it up more. Faster in manual mode (measurably). I Drive it in ESC sport mode all the time and dynamic engine in individual mode. Next is to lease new S60 T6 R-Design with sport suspension, bowers, advanced pkg, park pilot assist, and polestar optimization. Had one unexpected visit dealer visit common on all 2019 SPA Volvo's. The dynamic suspension rides amazingly, although for my personal tastes I wouldn't mind the sport suspensions added firmness, I'm still happy with the dynamic. Stock conti tires are trash, no grip and poor wet performance. Good wear. Overall, love it and the momentum T6 trim with premium and multimedia pkgs is well equipped.

volvo,s60-cross-country,2018,Nisbett, 12/28/2018,It's nice to be back in a Volvo again,5,"There is nothing like the magic carpet ride of a Volvo.  With excellent suspension, handles well, steers perfection, air tight and hardly any road noise. The stereo surrounds you with the most comfortable seats that only Volvo can make.   I have tried other cars from Toyota's, Subaru's, Mercedes, Saabs, Ford, and Chevy, but Volvo's continue to be the best ride for comfort, fun and safety. Love this new S60 Cross Country, sporty, but also very practical and useful with family. Thank you Volvo for making such well engineered cars.

volvo,s90,2017,Nelson P, 04/21/2017,"Beautiful car huge potential, but needs refinement",3,"I'll start off with the car is absolutely gorgeous. The interior and exterior style is one of the best in its class; the Audi A6 feels uninspired, the BMW 5 series is just basic, only the Mercedes E class might be able to hold a candle to the S90. 

Here’s what I love about the car:
1. Design is absolutely incredible. 
2. B&W sound system is incredible!
3. iPad-like infotainment system is intuitive and awesome
4. Safety systems. I can never go back. The Auto-pilot, adaptive cruise, lane keep, collision detection all work as advertised and are amazing.
5. Heads up display (HUD) is a cool trick! I thought it was gimmicky but now love it.
6. AWD performance in rain is incredible. On snow… not so much, but I blame the tires not the car.
7. Heated/cooled seats 
8. The diving profiles really change the characteristics of the car.
9. Ability to send the car destinations


My issues with the car: 
1. Fit and finish. The car has excessive squeaks, rattles, and road noise for a car with this price tag. I was caught up in the moment when during the test drive, but now after a couple of months, I need to drive with the music playing in order to enjoy the car and drown out the squeaks coming from the door seals and plastic bits. The road noise is also incredibly intrusive on Oregon/Washington pot-hole and crack-laden roads and highways. The luxury feel is compromised by the noise which is really unfortunate. 
2. My second issue is with the front seats. The seats use a wire springs to support the driver. Unfortunately there are also some hard metal support beams that provide structure and rigidity to the thigh and leg support portions of the seat. Under the weight of the driver, these support 'beams' dig into your leg and thigh. No amount of adjusting will prevent this. Volvo should have used higher density foam or a full metal support under the seat to prevent the driver’s weight from compressing the foam and causing the support to dig into the drivers legs. Again, I must have been caught up in the moment of the test drive, because I didn't notice this until after I took the car home. So I'm relegated to using a donuts or foam cushion for long-hauls. 
3. Opportunity number three. The infotainment system is ever so slightly under powered. It takes a lot of time for it to boot up. Thankfully the instrument cluster starts up right away. 
4. Four, certain items need to be turned off every driving session. For example, the auto high beams, the auto start/stop, or my preferred driver setting -- I need to turn these on/off every time I start the car. Other manufactures got this right. For example, BMW let customers change the default setting for auto start/stop to remember the last selected setting. I WISH Volvo would do that.
5. A/C has a tendency to kick into high gear randomly and it becomes really loud. You’re forced to turn it off if you are on a call. I think the problem is with the logic for the auto climate particularly when you have the 2nd row turned on. It’s as if the system was trying to compensate for the temperature differential and just… overcompensates.
6. General reliability: Since taking ownership in February, I’ve gone to the dealership 4 times (I’m writing this review in April). Issues ranging from recall notices (for leaking A/C lines and trim pieces fall off) to excessive condensation in the headlights (which still isn’t fixed even after new headlights) and a bunch of software issues. I’ll be scheduling a new visit to the dealership soon for break-related issues.
7. Wifi hotspot stopped working. Maybe because of my trial ending, but It stopped about week 2.
8. The on call app is a bit limited in its utility. At this point it’s not worth paying for after the trial period ends.
9. One last minor gripe. The manual claims that there is a power rear sunshade. I beg to differ. Found no mention of it being an option.

Overall, the
 car is soooo close to being perfect. My biggest concerns are with the rattling noises, uncomfortable seats, and with general software issues. I really wish I didn’t have to have a routine of turning on/off my settings every time I turn on the car. These fit-and-finish items are what hold this car back from really being able to compete against the refinement of the A6 and E class. I’m still holding out hope that these problems will be worked out in future Volvos built on this platform.

volvo,s90,2017,Llefty, 04/10/2017,Great value,4,"I don't know why my rating is coming up as two stars.  I'd rate it four stars.  I've only have my S90 for a short time, but so far, it's everything I wanted: all-wheel drive, fuel efficient, roomy, stylish, four heated seats, individual climate control, dynamic cruise control, LED steerable lights, handless trunk, good user interface.  I have a 2015 Lexus GS 350 and the Volvo turned out to be a better value than a 2017 GS 350.  Where I live, you can't find a Lexus with comparable equipment.  And if you want a user interface that will drive you nuts, try Lexus.  

My only two complaints are that the stock stereo is a bit anemic and there are a few settings, like auto highbeams, that have to be turned on every time you get in the car.  Also, the car is more of a cruiser than a sports sedan.  However, that it is not to say that it isn't stable or sufficiently responsive.  Unlike the previous reviewer, I haven't had any problems navigating the Sensus tablet-like interface.  Nor have I found Sensus to be slow to start.  I also am able to have my iphone chord come out of the center console while keeping the console closed.  I agree that it would be nice to have more usb ports rather than cigarette lighter outlets.  I absolutely love the dynamic cruise control, which works like a charm.  I've put 10k miles on the car in six months and love it even more than when I got it."

This car was superior in MPG, safety and leasing costs. Dealership salespeople were great (did not treat me with disrespect as other upper end auto dealerships do.

volvo,s90,2017,Terribly Disappointed, 08/05/2017,Electronics were the worst I have ever encountered,1,"Volvo designed a spectacularly beautiful vehicle and destroyed it by providing it with an inadequate microprocessor.  It was as if the entire car depended upon a Windows 95 operating system that needed de-fragmentation and rebooting every day.  Systems froze constantly but at random, providing a bad entertainment system of a sort.  Applications never worked.  Mobile WiFi connectivity was usually beyond the car's ability (displaying a nearly-ubiquitous  message of ""No connection to service"").  On my last drive the driver's seat moved on its own, the cruise control failed, the pilot assist failed, and the rear brakes (which had been replaced once) resumed their habit of bringing the car to a stop (when in reverse) with a lurch and a boom (as if I had hit something, which was never the case).  I have driven a Volvo for 33 years and still own some older ones, but I do not think I will ever buy another one.  I understand the current platform has created problems with the air conditioning system; perhaps this is Volvo's answer to global warming?

Update: I traded in the vehicle and took the loss now as opposed to later. It was only going to get worse. Months later Volvo USA sent me a nice magazine, which went immediately into the recycle bin.

Update: I still have the mindset to never buy another Volvo.

Mileage:  Approximately 3900 U.S. Miles
Total Loss Incurred:  $9000 +/- Approximately with TTL

I had endless electrical and computer related problems with this vehicle and the vehicle eventually just left me stranded due to the battery dying at 3800 miles.  Turned into one of those nightmare “I bought a lemon” experiences you seem to always hear about at cocktail parties but never actually go through yourself.  Having now gone through the experience of owning a lemon I can tell you:  It will bring the worst out in a person and it is quite astonishing just how much of an impact owning a crap luxury car has on your day to day life.

Volvo is undergoing a revolution always a premium brand pushing further upmarket and not loosing their vision, if you are in the market for a midsize luxury sedan you owe it to yourself to check out the Volvo S90, get it loaded to the gills and you'll spend thousands and thousand less than the competition and in many ways get a better car.

At 4-5 months old, I was told by the service department my car needed new brakes. I told them the car was brand new and only a few months old.  I did not do the brakes.  Fast forward, and I did need new brakes.  The cost was only $1500.00 and not covered by the warranty.  By the way, my car is in service right now.  They said the oil gasket blew and its out of warranty.  I have to come up with $1796 plus tax tomorrow when I pick up the car.  There are too many other things to list.

I have every option except for the Inscription seats, which are too narrow for my hips. I feel pampered every time I drive it. I just wish it didn't depreciate so quickly.

The car is comfortable, responsive, and has in incredible sound system which, as an audiophile, is very important to me. I agree with some of the other reviews that the infotainment system is a little sluggish, but it's not terrible.

volvo,s90,2018,PSR, 04/21/2018,Overall LOVING my 2018 S90 Momentum,5,"Silver with the blonde interior; the car looks fantastic! I love the Thor's hammer headlights and the wide stance of the vehicle with the big 19' Pirellis. I've got lots of extras on it, which are functional and work super well. But my only concern with this car is the ride...at times very hard and not as sophisticated as a car at this price point should feel. Excellent gas mileage; great on the road feeling. LOVE LOVE LOVE the backseat legroom and the extra right passenger side buttons that control front right seat and sunroof. The car LOOKS serious, which I love. I've gotten many compliments on it. Pick up on this super well designed 4-cylinder turbo is beyond impressive. Love the stereo (standard) and the 360 camera. At times, the sensors for parking and other safety functions seem a little too sensitive but rather that than the opposite. Seat comfort is FANTASTIC, front and back. Ventilation and climate control are superb. Interior materials on all surfaces are FAR SUPERIOR to many makes of car. No rattles, squeaks or creaks throughout. I'm very happy with my S90, an upgrade from my 2016 S60 Inscription sedan. No regrets. Volvo is ROCKING the automotive world in many ways!
"
volvo,s90,2018,Catbert, 08/17/2018,"8 pluses, 1 minus",5,"The S90 is a beautiful car.  The proportions are perfect, and the styling is classic.  The interior is the best place to be of any of the 50 plus cars I’ve owned.  The aesthetics are perfect.  The performance of my T5 AWD is what I expected, not a killer, for sure.  I knew that going in, and if performance with a capital P was totally important, I would have sprung for the T6.  My driving is mostly highway, and 250ish HP is a OK.  And now the minuses.  The corporate 4 cyl. is....well, a 4 banger.  It isn’t particularly smooth, and doesn’t sound that great either.  It’s obviously a modern motor, but suffers from a cylinder deficiency in a large car application.  Sorry Volvo, but one size really doesn’t fit all.  It isn’t a horsepower issue, it’s about refinement and smoothness.  Lastly, the ride...it’s not that great.  Even on a smooth interstate highway, you can feel too way much road.  I understand it isn’t a Rolls or Big Jag, but it isn’t an C class either.  Volvo would do well to farm out the chassis tuning if they can’t do better.  Bottom line the S90 is one or two cylinders and a more compliant chassis away from a World class near luxury sedan.

UPDATE.  Seems a large part of the road harshness was not one, but three Pirelli P Zero tires that were not able to be balanced, or maybe not exactly round.  After replacement the road noise and vibration/harmonics are hugely improved.

MY GAS MILEAGE.  Now that the S90 is well broken in, I can report Interstate mileage of 32.9 MPG on my last long trip.  This is at speed limit plus 4 mph, i.e. 64-74 mph.  My suburban every day driving is right at 25 mpg.  I am not a feather foot.

volvo,s90,2018,Greg, 04/27/2018,Better than my Audi and Lexus,5,"This is my first Volvo, and I like it much better than my 2018 Audi.  The touch screen eliminates all the draw pads and knobs which I thought were a pain.  Everything is so simple and intuitive.  The auto pilot beats every other gizmo out there.  I waited to see th 2019 Lexus ES300h, which I also owned when it first came out and loved the gas mileage. That is not such an issue these days, and, I’m tired of how Lexus keeps making their grill more and more crazy  horizontal, vertical, etc.  The Volvo has an elegant look, and the back seat has even more room than the Lexus.  It drives nicely and has a huge sunroof.  The rear seat has buttons to move the front seat forward, and can also adjust the sunroof shade.  Both rear seats fold down for extra trunk space.  The trunk opens with your foot and closes automatically.  In addition to the touch screen, which behaves like an iPad with swiping, Volvo has a great iPhone app that starts the car using On Call.  It can also lock and share stats.  It’s much better than the Audi app that was created with weird, multiple tabs.  I got the T5 for better mileage. The engine is a little noisy, but, that’s ok.  I’m very happy with driving this luxury sedan and got a good deal on it.  Signing the contract was awesome.  Th finance office desk is a actually a 3 x 4 giant screen and all you do is review and click.   Completely paperless!  I was in and out in minutes and they didn’t push all the extra warranties like Audi.   Very pleased!

I love how roomy it is and the leather seats.  Favorite feature is the heads up display.  I'm looking to buy a second car but really hard to consider buying my dream sports car without the heads up display.  The reason I didn't give this a 5/5 is because I had to take my practically brand new car in when my turn signal and several other features just stopped working.

Great on the hiway.  
Plenty of power and great gas mileage.  However....
Cons
Car was built in China.  Rear rotors have failed at 20,000 miles and Volvo won’t pay for the repair.  Cheap Chinese steel.  
GPS programming was designed by an idiot. 
Climate control is the worst i’ve ever owned in 50 years of car owning. 
Too few buttons for direct access leads to too much time looking at center screen interface rather than at the road.  
Voice commands extremely slow to respond And sketchy at best.

Even my passengers ask why it shakes each time we stop and go.  Sure, I can disable by selecting Dynamic, but I do this 2-3 times a day.  I’m told Volvo will not disable due to MPG and emission fears.  Have your attorneys draft a “I agree” button to whatever makes your legal department happy.  It is so much more noticeable then my Lexus Hybrid.  I can live with the horrible voice activation and not so good GPS,and the rest of the car is perfect.  Read all the comments out there and give your customer base the option. Let us disable start/stop.  It’s our car, our right.   The only other issue is the blind side warning light is not bright enough to catch your eye.

A/C heater fan: very loud, could be quieter in 60K car. 4. Infotainment/Comfort controls: everything is incorporated in Ipad like touch screen device. It is very confusing and it is not safe.I would change it back to buttons in a heart beat. As I said in a title: Excellent car for 325 a month. For 400 I would shop around. I think Buick, Lincoln would provide same quality of ride with better Infotainment system and buttons controls.

Harsh ride..Engine is not a refined motor for $50K  To me...this is a $30-40K car I am not a fan, owning many high end cars. I should have rented one for a week first...Selling very soon.

volvo,s90,2018,VB, 08/13/2019,Annoying auto/stop,3,"I traded my 2018 Audi A5 for this Volvo and 2 years later my Volvo has depreciated about twice as much as the Audi.  I asked the dealer several times to find a way to disengage the auto stop/start, but they are of no help.  I have to push a button every time I drive the car, otherwise there is an annoying  shaking every time I stop and go.   Not subtle at all.  The Pilot Assist is only good for straight highways.  Otherwise the car will weave back and forth over lines and turn off the road at exits when lines disappear.  Lastly, the GPS is bad, and very difficult to judge distances when to turn.  I always have to send the destination from my phone because the voice recognition is horrible.  Otherwise, it’s a nice looking and comfortable car to drive.

volvo,s90,2018,Bill, 03/04/2020,Terrible rental car,1,"I have one a S90 T8 for a week from hertz.. I should have taken it back while I was still in the garage at the air port.  It has 12,700 miles and already has a new set of tires on the front.  The seats are showing a lot of wear,  with the perforated part looking thin. Several of the plastic buttons feel thin and cheap.  I was shocked to read the wood trim is actually wood. Feels like plastic.  
I dont know what this is, maybe the electric part charging itself, but this car has a constant drone sound that is really annoying.  Even when the engine is on, you can hear it. We just came back from dinner and I am ready to take it to the local Hertz agency in the morning.  Way to expensive of a car to be annoyed with.   I have a BMW at home and there is no comparison. "
volvo,s90,2018,JohnL, 11/24/2019,Awesome,5,"This car is awesome and equipped with a bounty of safety features.  Extremely comfortable and despite a 4 cylinder engine it has plenty of punch.  This is a large sedan and it is a ""car"".  Plenty of passenger room both front and rear and beautifully designed and comfortable interior.  Visibility is good and the car handles nicely.  Not meant for laps at your local racetrack but on the highway it's supremely quiet and holds the road well.  I have the T5 Momentum AWD and truly enjoy driving this vehicle.  No problems to date and have owned it over a year now.  Wish the dimming rearview mirror was less glaring at night reflecting the headlamps behind me.   Other than that it's a class act and it actually drives like a car and it actually is a sedan.

volvo,s90,2018,JohnG, 07/31/2020,Servicing Surprise,4,"I brought my 2018 Volvo S90 AWD in for regular servicing on 7/20/20. It has 17K miles on it, and I have had it since 11/'18. I was told it needed a complete brake job costing $665. I never had a car before that needed a brake job done with such low mileage. All of my driving is to local stores, and an adjacent county. My son, who was with Land Rover, called an Insurance Adjuster he knew about it the brake job. The Adjuster said ""the brakes on that model do not last long at all"" it's a Volvo problem"". 
Also, for a luxury car going over the bumps in the road, you feel them, and due to the 4 wheel drive, some are teeth jarring! The tires should have been one size larger, and the shock absorption better.
Also, the car sits much lower than what I was used to of getting in and out of my previous vehicles I'm only 5'9"" and ""drop in"" and hold onto the car rail to get out comfortably. . 
It has all the latest tech& safety features, beautiful design, plush interior, and performs well on the highway, when passing power is needed.
I have been buying Volvos since buying my first: 1985 450GL (brick on wheels), and I'm looking forward to turning this one back to the dealer in 2021 for another.

volvo,s90,2019,Howie K, 06/06/2019,It’s a BIG and Plush vehicle. Review +1 year,5,"I generally favor sportier cars, but now I am driving a Volvo S90 T5 which I got at a lease price that I could not refuse!  [Actually less per month that my former Infiniti Q50.]  So I will say I got a lot of bang for the buck.   This is a luxury car that one would not mind being chauffeured in.  The rear passenger area is HUGE and comfortable.  I can finally sit in front passenger seat and not even have to think about adjusting the seat for rear passages leg room.  The Driver’s seat is very pleasant for sitting and was designed by a Orthopedist.  The package came with a Blonde (white) interior which (needs occasional cleaning), is wonderful and elegant.  I would say it is the most nicely appointed car I ever owned.  (And I have and had several MB and BMWs).
   The Tech is amazing!  Though sometimes touch screen  is a bit overwhelming.  The great thing is that you can put the car on Auto Assist Pilot, play with it without worrying about hitting anything on the road.  (PS I do not support being a distractive driver, but this practically eliminates it under the right conditions.  Always be alert).
The Auto Assist Pilot is from the future.  It is not quite at Tesla level, but does much to keep you very safe while also removing the the tedium of Stop and Go traffic.  Driving is now an ‘AHHH”.  (My insurance rates actually went down when ordering this car.). It is a wonderfully solid vehicle.  I will lend this Car to anyone of my family and know they will be safe in it.  Gotta love that Swedish engineering. 
The trade off is the sporty feel of performance.  The Volvo is powerful for a 4 cylinder, and I get 25.5 mpg.  (Again better than my past Infinity).  0-60 is quite good for a car this size, but you do lose the ‘feel’ of lungeing  acceleration. (But you can use electronic options). It is a great luxury (family) car before it is a sports car.  The ride is firm as you ‘float’ over the road.   It’s very nice and quiet.  Long trips are a pleasure. All in all, it is a car to enjoy the ride in.  If you can get great deal on this extremely plush car, don’t hesitate.  (P.S. also drove the Volvo S60 for the while.  The ride and feel of the S90 is much better). 
   {A buying note: Volvo pricing is company set and it is difficult to negotiate a lower price When visiting other dealers.  There is not much wiggle room so choose the dealership with the best service.}

1 Year Later - still the most comfortable car I ever owned.  A pleasure to take a ride in for long road trips. 
Pros: Orthopedically Seats 5 w/ enough backseat legroom to play football in.  No more squishing upfront seat to allow backseat room.  Trunk is large doesn’t seem to be.  I guess it is the awkward design.  Low but deep.  I Love how in winter seats & steering wheel heat up to settings automatically when temp is below 40 degrees.  3 individual temp settings (not even my son’s Tesla S has that.). The Swedes made it solid and sure foot in harsh weather.  It is my go-to car in snow and slush.  Much better handling than my wife’s Mercedes C Class (which isn’t bad).  This car is tank-like sturdy.   An idiot SUV driver already backed into my rear fender in a parking lot, and l had no major damage. Have no doubt it will do a great job protecting passengers and family in a crash.  (HF).

 Con: I still find the screen controls cumbersome and confusing.  The car has  only driver 1 USB, so had to plug in a hub to use both phone and SD music card (no biggie).  I have found that the autopilot is not perfect.  It will veer of the road (not follow the road lines in certain situations, [with steep curves in road at higher speeds) so keep you hands on the wheel and pay some attention, [so NO napping!], but it is still a great feature 90% of the time.. But Is still a pleasure to take the stress out of everyday driving.  
Still love this car as the next evolution in driving.

TWO YEARS
 IN;
Still enjoying the ride. Still a very comfortable, plush and quiet car to drive.  Volvo has engineered a great car. Some of the Lux tech is great.  ex- I can preset the the temperature (like an alarm clock) so I can enter the car at my preferred climate for trips to and from work.  
However, center panel navi-entertainment system gets a bit tiresome.  Not simple to operate.  And the Nav system itself, while 98% accurate most of the time.  Does not adjust best route for traffic & other delays. I miss my old Garmin made system (ie-MB). However, I do enjoy the S90’s ride.

volvo,v60,2015,stew19, 05/24/2015,Exceeds expectations,5,"After driving BMWs, Audis, and Lexus, I have been delightfully surprised by my V60. It drives and performs very well, is quiet and very comfortable and looks great. I don't understand why people continue to buy SUVs and crossovers, which get poor mileage and don't perform as well as wagons.  "
volvo,v60,2015,matt1122, 03/31/2014,Good as a sportswagon gets...,4,"If you want a wagon that goes fast, handles very well, and is still a great daily driver, it doesn't get any better than this. If you want to spend twice as much, you can get the rocket ship which is the E63 AMG wagon, but it is a much larger car. If you want the odd styling a Cadillac CTS-V, you'll get a car that's probably more fun and is certainly faster, but I didn't find it nearly as comfortable as the Volvo V60 R-Design. This car is the perfect 20-year sequel to the 1995 Volvo 850 T-5R less a bit of boot space. Unlike the T-5R, it rides comfortably (no crash-iness), has All-Wheel-Drive, and isn't just fast by 20-year-old standards. "
volvo,v60,2015,Donald North, 06/06/2016,My best driving car yet!,5,"I'm a long time Saab car enthusiast owning several over the past 20+ years including the classic 900 Turbo, 9000 CSE Anniversary Edition, and 9-5 Aero wagon. My 2003 9-5 Aero wagon was a great car to drive, being very comfortable with plenty of cargo space. However at 266k miles, with a daily 90 mile commute, it was time to replace it. I wanted a car as comfortable as it, which is not easy to find. Most cars have poor front seats for long term driving comfort. I like to move around a lot of stuff and need cargo space, hence my interest in only wagons. I briefly considered the 328 wagon - I like its exterior styling, however as typical BMW their seats are uncomfortable to me and you sit too low in the car. My wife recently leased a 320 (drives nice; seats and ergonomics suck), and I sat in every car at the dealer from 2 to 7 series and all of the seats are far less comfortable than those in my V60. I also have a lot of concern about their long-term reliability since I try to keep my cars to 200k+ miles. I also considered the VW Golf wagon, but it wasn't as quiet on the freeway as I would like. I tried and bought a new 2015.5 V60 T5 Drive-E with sport seats and suspension and have enjoyed it every day since I bought it. It's now nearly 3 years old and already has 70k miles and has not had any reliability problems. I recently replaced the tires with the same Pirellis that came with car. It is quiet and smooth at highway speeds and corners tightly and confidently. Front seats are very comfortable and need a little time to break in. Front visibility is great with no glare. I like the control layout and enjoy listening to satellite radio every day. Bluetooth connection to my phone is reliable and telephone sound quality is excellent. My only complaint was the stock acceleration was not quite as strong feeling as I enjoyed with my Saab. However that was fixed and the car transformed when I recently bought the Polestar Performance Optimization software for the car. It can be easily downloaded and installed at any Volvo dealer. With the new software, it now passes very quickly on the freeway while also improving the throttle and transmission behavior. Highway gas mileage in unchanged. This is now one hell of a European car! To me the V60 T5 Drive-E with Polestar software is the best currently available balance of comfort, safety, driving experience, fuel economy, and storage capacity. Highly recommended!

volvo,v60,2015,Mike Simmons, 08/18/2015,Terrific Wagon - A Swedish Sleeper,5,"If you're dying for longer glances at the Starbucks drive-thru -- get your BMW or Audi wagon with great haste.  Or line up for your favorite pseudo-sporty crossover.   But if you're dying for an immensely likeable and practical wagon, the V60 really checks all the boxes.   Seriously folks... the V60 is a Volvo at heart (incredible seats, up-to-date and seamless safety features) with enough spunk and sport to make things interesting.   I went with the FWD version, and am consistently getting mid 20's gas mileage around town, and mid 30's on the highway.  Huge plus -- the 4-cylinder turbo is a VAST improvement over the 5-cylinder turbo I had on my older S60.  Lag is minimal, and the whoosh is maximal.    The ride is Euro firm yet comfortable -- and until I export the car (and my career) to some village in the Swiss Alps, the handling has plenty of bite for everyday driving.  Other positives -- the Sensus system is pretty intuitive, and if you are carting around younger children (roughly 4 to 8 years old) do yourself a HUGE favor and find a V60 with the integrated booster seats.   Incredible option -- almost worth the price of admission for any parent.   

No matter how capable the V60 is -- my hunch is that it will get lost in the compact wagon and SUV shuffle.   No screaming BMW badge... no butch plastic on the outside to make you think you're ready to scale Everest.  But consider it your gain.  I got a pretty aggressive deal from my local dealer since these aren't exactly flying off the showroom floor.   And while the rear seat is plenty roomy for kids and teens -- I don't think a 6-footer would want to hang out in the backseat for an extended trip.

I've owned Audi's, BMW's, VW's & other Volvos (last car was the XC70), & this car blows me away. Handling is perfect; fuel economy amazing; styling minimalistic but perfect.  The technology features are simply amazing. I have a teen driver, so the safety features - warnings when you get too close to the car in front, lane departure warnings, blind spot, rear camera, etc. - are essential.  I paid at least $12k more for comparable German cars, and didn't get anywhere near the value or features found in this car. Chose FWD because w/traction control, it's nearly as good as AWD.  Space & storage also fine, even as compared to the XC70. Better than German. "
volvo,v60,2015,jimbonada, 12/13/2014,Cool Wagon,4,Picked up the 2015 V60 in October 2014 after turning in a 2012 T5 sedan. Major difference is handling. Steering is crisper and stays centered where as T5 tended to float. Also the engine is phenomenal. I'm getting 28 mpg mixed use vs 23 mpg in old T5 without a sacrifice in horsepower. What attracted me to this car is that it does not look like a wagon but more like a crossover without the height and extra cost. There is one caveat however. My car came with a start/stop feature. I've gotten used to it but for some they may not. It's the feeling of an engine stalling and starting up again. You can however manually shut it off. My wife hates it. I leave on just to annoy her. LOL!
volvo,v60,2015,Matt, 11/04/2015,Set yourself apart from the crown,5,"Americans need to wake up and end the crossover craze. And the Volvo V60 is a fantastic option. Not only does it offer exceptional design style, but it handles like a sports car - something a SUV can't offer. In addition I still can have optional awd and it can tow my speed boat on a trailer. The engine has incredible pick up, and the ride is just fun. This may be my best car purchase ever!

volvo,v60,2015,Steve Paul, 11/29/2015,Great Combo of Power/torque and Gas Economy,5,"Ordered our 2015 V60 in March 2014 soon after it went on sale in the USA, and delivered May 2014. Our dealer only had AWD in stock, but wanted FWD with the new Turbocharged Drive-E 4cyl engine/8-speed transmission. What a great combo of power/torque and gas economy. Easy 30+ mpg highway. 

Two options ordered were the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) and heated fabric seats (all)…one of the few cars you can buy heated seats without leather. Base model also lacks the roof rails, also my preference for a cleaner look. And base model dashboard I prefer over the upgrade electronic dashboard.

Best Features:  engine/trans combination, classic Volvo seating perfect for my 6’ size, 36,000 miles of maintenance included, and Euro styling.

Worst Feature:  1) Excessively aggressive start/stop. Learned to use the paddle-shifter Left to disable in traffic and in anticipation of signal light change and turns. I doubt the feature really saves very much. Just one unplanned repair of this feature in the life of the car will more than negate any fuel saving.
2) No Oil Dipstick in the Drive-E Engine…ugh!

Also considered the Audi A3 but arrogance of dealer turned me off, and would have also considered a Saab had they not gone broke.

Wife has the XC60, and I prefer the V60 as a driver’s car.

Tip:  Free 6 months of Sirius has expiration date, so activate your free period promptly. Had to negotiate with Sirius to get my full 6 months.

Favorite car after previously owning (new) in order:  VW, Audi, Impala SS, Saab 9-3, and Cadillac CTS.

volvo,v60,2015,R M M, 09/13/2016,THIS CANNOT BE A WAGON! Surprising Performance,5,"I canNOT believe that this is a wagon. It outperformed the 3 series BMW in my test drives, and continues to impress. We were really skeptical on the MPG claims, but it does fairly close to it (if you can resist the temptation to enjoy the surprising pickup). We generally  are ""green drivers"" and get better than usual miles, but I still doubted the 37mpg highway claim. Yet, this morning, I got 33 in a 15mi city drive from my kids' school to the office (A/C on as it was ~90F outside), but this is Raleigh NC traffic (mild). This weekend we had the car loaded with 2x large adults, 2x kids(in giant, heavy, 5 point boosters), 2x 10gl coolers full of drinks and ice, a small bag of clothes, 2 large picnic blankets, 2 folding chairs, and a 60lbs dog, but we still did 29mpg in a mix drive(60mi city/25mi hwy) of 85mi (round trip). The trunk space is great. All that stuff fit and the giant poodle still could stretched out on his bed. The software for trip computer and other things could be simpler, and the breaks feel too smooth for people that enjoy the sporty action of an audi, but the car is excellent in every other way. Ohhhhhhh, the seats are amazing.

Updates: over a year in and we continue to be very happy with this Volvo. It is comfortable, has ample space for us, it is versatile, drives like a sports car(except for soft/smooth breaks), and gets decent mileage if driven accordingly. Only snag is that the cell app is impossible to get working for us, so I don't get to turn it on before getting out of the house, etc.
"
volvo,v60,2015,Eric Nesset, 09/10/2015,Agree with Edmunds review but....,5,"Basically the Edmunds review of Volvo's V60 is accurate in my experience, having purchased a new 2015.5 T5 Premier five months and 7000 miles ago.  The only nit I would pick are the comments about the controls of the Sensus electronics system. The review mentions that the control via a dial on the central instrument panel is less than optimal.  I would agree if this was the only way to control the various systems such as media, navigation, internet, etc.  However, all of these systems can alternatively be controlled via the curled knob and a couple of pads located on the right hand of the steering wheel with your right hand thumb.  Personally, I hardly ever use the dial on the center instrument cluster and use the steering wheel controls for entering radio, sirius, internet, navigation and phone inputs which I feel is at least as convenient as a central console mouse type control because you can leave both hands on the steering wheel while controlling these systems.

After 18 months and 22,000 miles of ownership the car is still performing as new.  Gas mileage is averaging about 30 mpg which is exceeding my expectations considering its performance and comfort. The only maintenance has been two Dealer 10K oil changes and checkups at no cost to me. The only changes to the car I would recommend are faster than 3G internet and the cars rather wide turning radius makes parking in tight spots a little challenging. The driver and passenger front seats are very comfortable on all day drives. 

I have now driven my V60 38,000 miles with no problems.  Only routine 10K service and absolutely no repairs or issues with the car.  I use it primarily for road trips and average over 30 mpg.  The seats are really comfortable on all day drives and the leather looks new but I clean and treat the leather upholstery about twice a year so I'm sure that helps.  I replaced the OEM Continental tires after only 25K miles because they became very noisy. The Pirelli P7 tires on the car now are much quieter and seem to be wearing well.

Now I have 43,500 miles with no problems.  Only regular 10K service and no repairs.  The 40K service (the first I had to pay for) seemed a bit expensive but I choose to have the brake fluid changed because I live in the humid southeast which added to the cost. I continue to get 30+mpg in mostly highway driving.

I have been able to hit all EPA mileage ratings, including highway. I have 30 mpg average over the last 6K miles. Car has been flawless, easy to use, drive, etc. I still catch myself staring at it, or pausing while sitting in it to take it all in. Went on a month long vacation with my wife. We fit everything we needed and our cat in the car with the seats down. Plenty of room. It's fast, quiet at highway speed, and the seats are wonderful. I've done four 12hr stints in the driver's seat at not been uncomfortable at all. This car is a gem, I think it should be on your test drive list, at the least. "

I replaced it with a leased Buick Regal, a car with better technology but handling and performance that was not as good and gas mileage that was not any better. As my lease expired I looked at a lot of different cars.  I discovered the V60 had mostly better technology features that the Buick, performance and handling that was not quite as good as the Saab but close, and much better fuel efficiency.  The V60 is also tremendously comfortable; a keeper."

The drive is nice, though there's a noticeable hesitation after stepping on the gas.
Handling and ride are very good.
It's much smaller than the boxy volvo wagons of old.
The back hatch is adequate for groceries or a small dog (like my mini Aussie).
But forget about bikes, even with the seats down.
The legroom for backseat passengers is tiny.
My pre-teen kids are ok but adults would be uncomfortable.
The front seats on the other hand are exceptionally comfortable.
The hi-tech & eco features are spotty, especially auto engine shutoff when stopped .
MPG is well below EPA estimates."

Performance of this model is decent - I have the AWD with the older 2.5 T5 and the 5sp auto. I like the known reliability of the older engine, although the performance and fuel economy of the newer one was appealing, it wasn't an option in this model year, and I was looking for a lightly used vehicle. 

2015.5 for electronics is key - better nav, better 'infotainment' with an upgraded Sensus setup. The car has a built-in wifi hotspot (it's ATT service, and free until Volvo figures out how to pass thru charges) in addition to OnCall (Volvo's version of OnStar) and Sirius traffic is free for 4 years from original sale date.

Seats are very comfy - I don't have the sport package, which has larger bolstered seats, but I do have the Climate package, so everything that should be heated or cooled is done automatically. Storage is smallish for a wagon, but still useful.

Styling of both outside and inside is nice - very Swedish still, which is good - I was glad to see that Geely didn't distract from that or the safety of Volvo when they purchased the company. Safety features are great - backup cam and sensors include a cross-traffic warning, and the City Safety function hasn't been used by me, but it's nice to know it's there.

volvo,v60,2015,Gary, 06/25/2017,Piece of Swedish Junk,2,"Car has been in 6 times for an issue with loss of power. They rebuilt the engine at 29k miles. Still exhibits intermittent power loss due to pre-detonation of spark plugs which retards the timing causing the loss of power. Happens without warning which makes it very unsafe to drive when merging. Volvo has acknowledge the issue yet states it will happen under certain conditions. They have been completely and utterly useless and are unwilling to resolve the issue. Do a search under Volvo Drive E Clicking and you will find the info. 3rd and last Volvo. *update* Volvo finally replaced the defective motor at 39k after reaching out to the CEO. Car has performed without a flaw since that time.

volvo,v60,2015,Mike, 07/26/2015,Resale Vaule Terrible - Do not buy,2,"I bought this car about 115 months ago thinking it would be great for a new family. I went to bring my newborn home and the rear-facing car seat did not fit, when I say it did not fit I mean the front passenger seat had roughly 3inches of legroom making the seat unusable. After finding the car would not fit out needs I went to trade in the car and visited 7 dealers and the car had depreciated higher than 50%. The sticker on my car was 42,534 and the trading in came in at 20k after just 15months. If you are looking at this car plan on keeping it for a long time or you will be throwing money away.

Do you like a car that makes you say ""WOWZER!"" when you get in and it roars to life?  If you have answered ""yes"" to any of these, then you should pass by the V60.  The bluetooth entertainment system facilitates that the driver will need to physically use his/her phone to navigate through music selections.  Power?  There is none.  I can't imagine having a load of family and bags in this thing and trying to cross a busy road.  I have no confidence in doing so solo.  Selecting manual shift mode will help somewhat, but even then, the shifting is so delayed that you could get stuck trying to get out of traffic in a hurry.  Style?  It has the style appeal of a harvest gold dishwasher in a granite and stainless steel kitchen.  You've no doubt heard the expression that one could screw up a ball bearing....Welcome Chinese ingenuity to the world of Volvo.

volvo,v60,2016,Vicki, 03/31/2016,Immediately Knew It Was My Car,5,"I have spent the last year and a half researching vehicles on line and test driving cars that looked promising.  My focus was on a crossover SUV, with the top three eventually being (in no particular order) the Volvo XC60, Acura RDX and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid.  I test drove all three cars more than once and still couldn't determine a clear favorite.  One evening, I read Edmunds review of the Volvo V60 wagon, which I hadn't researched, but was very interested in the car after reading the review.  I test drove the car a few days later and liked it, and the following weekend, took my spouse to the dealership to try the car, not intending to get one that day.  We were both really impressed with the handling, the zippy drive, and the way it felt on the freeway and on the city streets.  We decided to try the XC60 again while we were there for an immediate comparison, but I got behind the wheel of the V60 one more time and knew it wasn't necessary to drive another car; this one was it, and we drove it home that evening.  Basically, the V60 is very similar to the XC60, just doesn't have the SUV height.  The seats are so comfortable, the dash and instrumentation clear and easy to read, and the best feature for me is the blind spot monitor which is built into the post rather than the side mirror, which I much prefer.  This is a solid vehicle, with excellent pick-up and acceleration and a very smooth ride and very good gas mileage.  I wanted the new safety features available on today's cars which was the reason for the new car, and they are totally worth it.  Backed out of the driveway the other day, and the cross traffic alert let me know that a car was speeding down our street.  Very clear picture in the back-up camera and navigation screen.  All the bells and whistles are easy to program.  V60 scored well on all the safety tests, which was a must for me.  Very happy with the decision, and I am looking for reasons to get in the car and drive it!

6-Month Update:  Still love this car.  Seat comfort is outstanding.  We have driven it on a couple of road trips, and the ride is smooth and comfortable.  Air conditioning is spot on, and the sound system is fine, even though we didn't get an upgraded system.  Gas mileage has been good, too, especially on the highway on the trips we have taken.  Two things I particularly love:  the blind spot monitor and the rear view through the back window.  Re the blind spot: the amber light is positioned perfectly on the interior of the car rather than on the outside mirrors as it is on other vehicles.  It is not intrusive at all and is a useful tool when planning to change lanes.  I also really like the view out the back window looking through the rear view mirror.  When the backseat headrests are reclined, it is like looking through a picture window!  Even when the headrests are in the up position, it is still a clear, big view out the back window.  And, the car is fun to drive.  Zippy and responsive.  No complaints or remorse after six months; I really like this car.  My husband enjoyed driving this car so much that he got an Inscription S60, which is proving to be just as satisfactory to him.
"
volvo,v60,2016,Claire, 02/14/2017,My dream car since I was 16,5,"I am very pleased with this car; my husband and I bought ours used with only 15000 miles for 28K, and could not be happier. We were unfortunate members of the VW Dieselgate scandal, and decided to sell our car back to VW and upgrade. While I do miss the sportier handling of my VW, this car is amazing and feels so professional. Also, a week after we bought this car, an Uber driver bashed into my passenger side; without the heavy profile of this car (1-3 tons), I would have been knocked into the next lane and probably been in two accidents. The BLIS safety system helped me prove my case to the insurance company that the other driver was at fault because I saw the BLIS light up as he veered into my lane and was able to share this with my insurance company. Because of all of the safety features of this car, our insurance actually went down from where it had been with my VW. This car will haul you-know-what onto the freeway and turns itself off when you are sitting in traffic, which in LA is a lot. I am not in love with the slow charging USB port, but nothing is perfect. Very grateful to be in a safe and beautiful Volvo, which I have wanted since I was 16. The back also nicely holds our Boxer and German Shepherd dogs and they love to go for rides; they jump right in when I lift the hatch. If my dogs love it, it's a winner! :)

volvo,v60,2016,Mike K, 11/20/2017,Volvo won me over from Audi,5,"This is my 2nd Volvo. First was a 2013 S60 T5 (5-cylinder) and because I liked it so much I got a 2016 V60 T5 wagon (4-cylinder). Having always been an ""Audi"" guy (I still think they’re great), I find the Volvo S & V60 out-performs the Audi for city and highway driving (that’s where I drive 80% + of the time) because of its less harsh/ comfortable suspension and its great/ fantastic seats. Also, I find the V60's engine performance is essentially perfect for the real roads of life here in southern California (that coming from a heavy foot), along with its wonderful 8 speed transmission, which has a sport mode that’s great for quicker shifting - performance, driving in the canyons, around town and particularly in bumper to bumper traffic, where it seems to intuitively know when to stay in gear/ not shift.
Also, what I like about Volvo’s in general, is there low key great, kind of timeless good looks that project a different, less in your face, “if you will” presence than Audi, BMW, Mercedes. In addition, they are less expensive as well.
In conclusion, “If” I wanted my 2016 Volvo V60 T5 to handle closer/ more similar on twisty roads to my previous Audi’s (they are “GREAT/ better” in that area), then all I need to do is get some 18”/ 19” rims that are a bit wider, higher performance tires, also a Polestar chip would not be bad as well. However, for how I use my car, this change is not necessary.

The engine seems to be just the right size for me with and dynamic mode you really can get up and go merge onto traffic,  cross streets with ease.  It is starting to look dated on the inside as the infotainment system is getting old and the navigation doesn’t work as well as my phone so I prefer to use my phone .

Also to find out your oil and other levels it’s complicated and on the car computer system. To get an oil change you can’t take it to any place to get done.

I should make clear that the V90 Cross Country is a beautiful car, like all new current Volvos; however, the newer volvos and of course in that V90, they have this iPad looking touch screen in the console where EVERYTHING is controled and accessed and in my honest opinion, it needs refinement.

volvo,v60,2019,Mosswagon, 08/09/2019,I bought the cheapest V60 in the US and I love it!,5,"Since you can only get the (non-cross country) V60 by special order I can't imagine most people are trying to buy the base model in this luxury segment. The starting price for 2019 on the T5 Momentum was $38,900. I fell in love with the cloth (City Weave) seats only offered on this trim so it wasn't a hard decision.  

You don't need all the bells and whistles. I saved over $5,000 skipping the Advanced and Multimedia packages. Volvo's navigation is unnecessary now that Apple Carplay and Android Auto allow for Google maps and I honestly don't mind the smaller 8"" digital display for the driver. The base stereo wasn't that bad compared to the mid-level HK either.

The default auto braking system when backing into traffic was a little startling at first - especially in city traffic. But I had no problem reducing the sensitivity through the touch screen. Then again, I’m the type of guy who really enjoys going through the manual and clicking through every feature until I am familiar with the system. I actually love how many things are customizable. A lot of journalists complain about the HVAC controls in the touch screen however I use the voice command system to adjust the temp. with no issues.

This was in the running with the top trim Subaru Outback and VW Alltrack. The Alltrack was a little more tossable in the corners even with its lifted ride height. I really was surprised by how much fun it was to drive - so much so that we test drove it twice! The VW was definitely the runner-up simply for its driving dynamics. The Outback’s CVT was a deal breaker - not mention it’s hideous looking (subjective, I know). The only thing I really enjoyed about the Subaru was how big it felt on the inside - especially the back seats. In the end we chose the base Volvo for a few thousand more. It’s more comfortable, quiet, and luxurious inside. The egress and ingress is what you’d expect compared to a CUV but I don’t have any issues putting my kid in his rear-facing child seat. The cargo is big enough for our family’s needs. 

I totally get why people hate on the new Volvo touch screen. Having the HVAC on the screen is definitely not my preference but the Volvo voice command system is great. We test drove a lot of CUVs and wagons (Outback, Alltrack, TourX, Hybrid Rav4, etc) and the Volvo screen was by far the most responsive - especially with the new chip update. Luckily there is still a button for max defrost. Would I prefer more physical buttons? Sure. But have you seen the body lines on the V60 wagon? It’s a worthy trade-off. In the end, it’s by far the most beautiful car I’ve ever owned. I’ve never looked back at my car in the parking lot until owning this V60.

volvo,v60-cross-country,2015,dcc305, 05/20/2015,"Solid, Comfortable, Stylish",5,"Unique styling drew me in when my S60 lease ended.  Cross shopped Audi, BMW; better value and not nearly as common. Drives a bit more ""sedate"" than S60 but still more sport sedan than luxury SUV. Handles well, brisk acceleration, nice steering feel, tad less agile than S60 but admirably close given the elevated ground clearance/AWD weight.   Quiet at speed, relaxing to drive but also fun and willing when pushed a bit. Sensus system is often criticized, but it makes sense to me and can be controlled from steering wheel, unlike competitors' systems.  The keypad that some consider ""dated"" adds functionality. My S60 was very dependable. I expect mechanically similar V60CC to be the same.

Update 5/18: Turned in at end of lease - would have bought, but buy-out was a bit over book.  Really enjoyed this car.  Family had issues with tight quarters, but as driver, very comfortable for me (average size male).  In 3 years of ownership, 26000 miles, no reliability issues aside from occasional hiccups with the infotainment system which would self-correct when car re-started.  I would agree with car review sites that, compared with competitors, Volvos drive a little “busier” - firm suspension, road imperfections come through, but overall car feels very solid and comfortable with better steering weight for my taste compared with Audi, BMW.

FIRST POST 
I looked at the Outback, the Audi, the BMW, the Benz, and the Volvo V60 CC. I studied all, test drove them and most importantly checked out cargo area. I spent 6 months researching!  The Volvo V 60 CC was the only one which fit my criteria of 1. Total driver seat comfort (like sitting in your favorite easy chair) 2. Handling (tight steering and a sporty-feel) 3. Able to carry 4 sets of golf clubs without removing any clubs from the bags (Yes, including drivers!).  I have two complaints. 1. the backup camera is on the outside of the car and will fog up with rain/snow 2. The tailgate is MANUAL and should be automatic.
The more I drive this car (past  year and 1/2) the more I love it!  And the dealerships I have worked with are great.

volvo,v60-cross-country,2015,Stephen Kish, 06/19/2016,Cute little wagon for 2 adults,4,"Wagon suits my wife perfectly. Smaller than our Outback was (more like our 2008 than our 2012 in rear seating) and also uses regular gas for it's 5 cylinder turbo engine. It drives okay for me in sports mode ONLY. Otherwise programmed to be slow and be more fuel efficient. Great seats. Better than my Audi S5's premium leather seats. Bought it Certified pre-owned (demo) with 7K miles. Over 3 years left on original warranty plus Volvo adds a 3 year certification. BMW, Audi, etc. add 2 years for CPO & Mercedes only 1.  I like the styling much more than the former Volvo wagons that looked like refrigerators on wheels.  This is a sleek modern looking vehicle. Like a maxi version on the former cute little C70 which I liked as much as Mini's if not more. Like most al wheel drive cars the mileage isn't great in the city. He just enough pep, but no faster than our former Outback 3.6R. However the Outback had no sport mode to add pep when passing or accelerating. It's smaller than the Outback which I like for city parking. Rear space is small for a wagon, but with rear seats folded down there is plenty of room. It held five tires easily when I changes tires from all the Scorpion all-seasons. I run summer and winter tires always. The brakes are a weak point. Much longer stopping distance than a car at this price should require. Being bought for safety it's disappointing and needs a fix. The better tires help a bit. I like the keyless entry and the auto folding side mirrors which fold when you lock the car for parking. The rear windows inhibit viability, but that's the design. Our other option to the Outback was the Audi Cross Country. The option was too expensive and not a faster car. The Volvo parts are outrageous! I wanted a set of wheels for winter snow tires, but they were $500/each. If one of the OEM wheels has to be replaced that's the cost. The Tire Rack doesn't have this cars fitment yet so until they get one to spec out I can't buy winter tires. I suspect that this is not a big a seller as the FWD V60 which is less expensive and lower. We needed the Cross Country for it's height for snow clearance. We get too much! I blast our wagons out of the long driveway rather than shovel. My Audi S5 doesn't have much clearance though AWD. I prefer not to use it in heavy snow though I run high performance winter tires (Dunlap winter sports) in one size down from the OEM 19s. I plan to buy W80s or Xice3's for the Volvo once I find reasonably priced wheels. No way I'm buying Volvo wheels at their pricing.
I bought W80s for snow and ice. Haven't had any bad weather to try them out. Rides well on these tires. Found really nice wheels from the tire rack. 
The electronics are limited to use with an AT&T mobile device (only) which is ridiculous. I use Verizon, so I can't use many features. Very sore point. 
On the positive side I stumbled onto a power mode feature that the dealership was not even aware of on this wagon. Rather than being part of the features you choose on the center console, it is on the turn signal! You choose power mode (1 of 3 choices) and put the shifter in sport mode and the car changes character from a slug to a car with zip. Now it stays in power mode!! I never use sport mode until the car warms up. Better safe than sorry. 
Overall I still think this car was a good choice. With Buick bringing the Opel wagon over from Europe where it is very popular, I may change my mind. I'll wait to see the Opel with the Buick badging.
Mileage on this car is disappointing. in spite of my sporty driving habits.

Instead of the car taking the impact, the driver and passengers end up feeling every little imperfection on the road. The sports seats dig into your hips/back and are painful. The engine is noisy.

volvo,v60-cross-country,2016,Steve, 02/23/2018,Just what I wanted,5,"I wanted a practical car to haul outdoor gear, bikes, kids and a dog. I've recently owned a 2013 Subaru Outback and a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. I wanted a car with utility but that was comfortable on long drives and in city traffic. My 2013 Outback is great but I gave it to my daughter and it left me wanting a little better handling. The cargo area is practical but not huge. The cabin area is not huge but it fits me well. The car has roof rails for a roof rack and the roof height is practical for loading. I really like the way the car rides and drives but it's not a sports car. The thing feels solid and the whole package inspires confidence. AWD, slightly elevated ride height, wagon utility and drives like a premium car. Frosting on the cake: runs on regular unleaded gas.
Update February 2019: I still love my V60 CC. I have not had any problems with the car. My local Volvo dealer closed so I have to drive further for service which is a bummer. I had to make a high speed evasive maneuver on highway 130. The speed limit is is 85 MPH and the wind blew an unsecured traffic barrier into my path. The Volvo was stable and composed and helped me avoid major damage to my car. My only gripe is that the back seats are a bit snug for adults. I recommend the V60 CC. It's a great car.

Most comfortable front seats.  Tech is dated and quirky but it works just fine.  Decent fuel economy.  Just something about this car tells me we’ll be keeping this one for a long time

volvo,v60-cross-country,2017,reg Wang, 04/07/2018,"Tight, solid like a rock!",5,"Disclaimer, I’ve only driven it for a week. It was a 2017 T5, 2.0 four cylinder turbo, black on Black. The steering feel could be adjusted to three levels of “heaviness”, which is a fun feature. The car feels very tightly put together, seats are bolstered although the big bottomed individuals may feel they are sitting on the ridge of the seat. Acceleration was fast, nimble handling (at The heaviest steering setting though, the turning radius seems to be reduced as it’s more for Autobahn driving). Suspension is firm but goes over bumps nicely, good isolation unlike what other say. Drives in slimes snow days like a champ, thanks to the Volvo unique AWD. Sound system is amazing at base trim. It’s a perfect little off-road wagon to replace the Crosstrek, X1 or any little SUV. Best for a college guy or girl with active lifestyle. It’s just such a nice car. Only gripe is it’s tag price when new. Buy a used, 2015-2017, all good, in-line 5 or 4. "

Good mileage....super comfortable seats......awesome sound system (basic)......could use a better cargo net for rear compartment—-I bought an aftermarket variety......I liked the carpeting on the 2004 XC70 much better... this carpet is a bit cheaper and mundane.... Great ground clearance for snowy conditions and rough situations... super reliable with zero issues in 31 months so far ..."

Smooth ride, quiet cabin...even with moon roof open. fit and finish is exceptional. acceleration is far better than I expected from a 4 cylinder (T6). I thought the ""assist"" technologies would be annoying...they are not...yet. the only shortcoming ive found is entering and exiting the drivers cabin. the footwell is deep and the rear door pillar makes for and awkward exit.. the stereo is very good and its not the harmon karden or b/w system.  i'm very happy with the vehicle

Maple Brown with Blonde Leather, Convenience pkg, heated strg wheel/windshield, 20 inch alloys, air ride susp, 115V power outlet rear, integrated split end pipes and load liner.  Driven about 300 miles and this wagon is very impressive.  Tight, drives smaller than it is, fit and finish perfect, systems fairly intuitive, fantastic acceleration, wi fi hotspot works great, tons of room in backseat.  I really wanted the B & W sound system, but at $3200, it was a no go.   Volvo has a home run here.

The second week Zi had my new v90 I was driving to pick up my daughter at school. A car was in my lane about to hit me head on. All of a sudden my v90 popped a red triangle in my windshield and moved my car to the right avoiding a collision. A guardian Angel must have persuaded me to indulge in this amazing car. The interior and ride is amazing. Love the refridgerator in the glove box. That is where I keep the Grey Poupon!

I will not own a SUV.  I will not have that butt ugly cladding around my wheel wells even if it is painted to match the car.  And I don't wear Birkenstocks or live that lifestyle.

That was a great car and never problematic. This one is better. Acceleration is almost as good, and most features are even better. I don't care for the 4 cylinder noise under hard acceleration, but it does the job and otherwise is quiet and comfortable. The massaging seats and Bowers&Wilkins stereo are fantastic additions. It rides a bit better than the S60, due to the rear air suspension and longer wheelbase.  Here's hoping it is every bit as reliable as the 2011.

Every single minute I spend in this car is happy and two of my friends have purchased Volvo after spending time in mine. The V90 T6 is responsive even at high altitudes, gets very good gas mileage, and does amazing in all weather. Volvo really thought of everything with the technology. If you can afford the Bowers and Wilkins sound system, get it. It’s the best sound system I’ve ever heard. The touch screen is actually very intuitive and easy to learn. One of my favorite parts about this car is the app. You can send directions to it ahead of time, easily track mileage for work, remote start from anywhere, and it tells you if you’ve left the car unlocked and let’s you lock it. The safety features in the car are amazing. My favorite is it’s self driving feature which works great even in substantial rain and low light. I love using it when I’m stuck in traffic. If I had to come up with a complaint it’s that the car uses a lot of wiper fluid since it power washes the headlights, but it always looks amazing.

volvo,v90,2019,the _hamster, 12/13/2019,Another Volvo winner,5,"Just leased a 2019 V90 Cross Country equipped with the “Advanced” package, which includes a ton of safety features not included as standard with this model.  A real pleasure to drive, a solid, well-built wagon not to be confused with a SUV, cross-over, or the like.  AWD, and rather mediocre fuel mileage reflects this...mid-20s mpg in city, near 30 on freeways.  But the driver/passenger safety and security of this vehicle trumps any other shortfalls, as minimal as they are.  More than adequate performance, but can be enhanced by choosing “Dynamic” driving mode.  All in all, a quality car with an excellent mfr. pedigree.

The V90XC is hands down the best. Roomier than the 60's and the 70, it handles better than the 90's. Road noise is minimal. Suspension is great. Just returned from a 600 mile round trip to New Hampshire and averaged 30.7 mpg. The adaptive cruise control works well and takes the frustration out of driving in traffic. On the trip from the dealer, driver stopped short in front of me and the emergency braking engaged at the same time I hit the brakes. Pretty amazing. All in all this is a pretty sweet ride.

volvo,v90-cross-country,2017,martin Rawdin, 05/27/2017,A Swedish beauty queen,5,"A wonderful road car.  I just took a 150 mile road trip and enjoyed every mile.  The technology packed into this car is amazing.  Most of the features are intuitive but some  require referring to the manual.  By the  waY the owners manual is over 500 pages.  The manual is stored on the cars computer and is read on the large screen in the center of the dashboard.  Of course the car has to be stopped.   A rather strange sensation occurs while driving on a highway.  When drifting to the painted lane lines, the cars steering nudges back into the center and you feel the tug on the steering wheel.

volvo,v90-cross-country,2017,Big A, 08/15/2019,From Benzs to Volvo,5,"I loved my wife’s 2019 XC60 inscription with BW sound I shopped my 2018 E class , very nice car, with the dealer.   They gave me a really good trade value and I bought their 2017 V90 CC in maple brown that the couldn’t move.  The Benz was terrific, but the pilot assist and sound system, massage seats with more adjustments all on a car that you don’t see often compelled the trade.   After 10 months and almost 24k miles I enjoy the car, a lot.   Love the light interior.  I thought the Benz 4 cylinder was peppy, and it is, but the turbo and supercharged Volvo is more powerful.  The wagonese look is a personal thing,  it just looks great.   Try one!

1 year update.  I have put on a lot of miles without any issues.  The V90 remains stunning, comfortable and the sound system rocks.  28.2 MPG is pretty darn good.  It remains a rare site on the roads.  Sadly I will be trading it only because we have a lot of snow here and we are in a very rural area, like no county road service and a long gravel drive.  We cam back from a December trip and still had 24” of snow on the ground, and the driveway.   It is a hike to get to the side by side which I use to tamp the snow down.   Luckily a neighbor with a front loader came to the rescue.   The V90 is competent in snow but 24” is too much, my neighbors have always said, “you need a truck”.   They are right and will provide a new review with a likely Lexis GX460 soon, or Tundra.   

I must add that my wife’s 2019 XC60 remains in the stable and also has 30K miles without mishap.  SHe loves it and we used it for our trip into Utah.  It too has the B&W sound system and it perfect all ways... except it too would be challenged with 24”of snow.   It is a keeper.

volvo,v90-cross-country,2017,Joy Sorensen, 06/24/2019,Best Car We've Ever Owned....Hands Down.,5,"We bought this wagon because we need a large cargo space with a lower profile than an SUV. I'm a short lady and I use a walker. It was by far the most expensive car we've ever bought...but it's worth every penny. Beautiful interior. Attention to detail. Sporty looking so I don't feel like I'm driving my mother's 1975 country squire...or a hearse. The only complaints I have are that I wish the car had a V-6 option. Although it has enough pep for our needs, we prefer a little more power under the hood. And, I wish the car was an actual color... and, for the record, black, white, grey, and silver aren't colors. Those are non-colors. Why don't manufacturers make cars with colors on them anymore? I think this car would be so awesome in bay watch yellow with a white interior. OMG.

volvo,v90-cross-country,2017,Dan, 06/22/2018,"Great potential, but long ways to go...",3,"It's bad that a car maker (Volvo) that is well-known for its emphasis on safe cars has created a very distracting (and poor) infortainment system, in which they have placed the climate controls, removing physical controls (other than window defrosters/defoggers); thus, the driver will be looking frequently to the center screen and removing eyes far from the road to make climate changes.  There are only 4 or 5 fan speeds available, also -- unlike the older system with buttons/dials, where you could control the fan speed much better.  They have also removed the ability to turn off auto-door-locking when the car starts to move, as well as the ability to turn off auto-start/stop and the ability to start in individual mode when the car starts up.  I can't get the radio/audio to not turn on when I turn on the engine.  The driving mode dial is in a horrible location and it's very finicky -- very poor design (this should be on the steering wheel, not in the center console near the cupholders).  The transmission is horrendous -- widely noted in reviews online; it has troubles changing gears smoothly, and this is very annoying to the driver.  The engine is just too small (2-liter, 4-cylinder) for a big, heavy car; having both superchargers and turbochargers seem like big problems waiting to happen down the road, and I wouldn't want this car out of warranty.  There's no option for a CD player in this car.  The gas tank is too small.  Read the Swedespeed.com owners forum to see all the problems owners have with this car.  It does have great potential, and there are a lot of plusses about this car (good visibility, good ground clearance, unique looking, etc.).

18-inch tires make for a comfortable ride but are not sporty.  T5 is good enough, if you want to feel sportier flip it to “Performance” mode.

volvo,v90-cross-country,2018,Jim C, 06/17/2019,Great Wagon,5,"I just bought a brand new 2018 V90CC leftover.  I got about 28% discount from list.  So it’s a huge bang for the buck. The car is smooth as silk. I wasn’t looking for a car quite this large but then again it’s only 4 inches longer than an Outback. The level of safety features is unparalleled. Anything you can think of is in it.  I have the base engine and it’s fine. It’s no world beater but on the highway I’ve gotten 30 mpg. I had a Tiguan they never got close to that. It’s extremely roomy, stylish, comfortable and versatile. I’ve moved furniture, towed a trailer, gotten groceries, mulch, took out my kayaks and bikes. It’s great without having to use a step ladder to put stuff up on the roof. I’m 6’3 and the rear has room for me with my drivers seat in position for me! What’s not to like. Beautiful, stylish, wonderful driving car rather than driving a box on wheels aka an SUV!

Update 6 mos. - now have put over 5,000 miles on the car and all I can say is that its great.  Its everything I wanted it to be.  Its comfortable, versatile and good looking. My really critical wife loves up too!  she says she feels so protected in the car.  I had one minor issue with the auto stop/start battery not holding a charge. I'm not surprised since it was an '18 leftover so it sat for 18 months. They replaced the battery, reset the computer and its been perfect ever since.  The only thing I I can say that needs improvement is the engine noise/exhaust note.  For a car this sharp, it could use some refinement in its tone.  (btw- i have a 6 cyl. 350Z so I may be a bit too critical).  Great car!

"
volvo,xc40,2018,Raoul Watson, 01/11/2019,An awesome compact SUV part 1,4,"This is the first Volvo I have ever owned in my life, my previous car was a 2015 Chevy Impala (see my review on the Impala). I always wanted a Volvo but always was apprehensive due to design and reliability reports from owners. The 2019 XC 40 however, seems to be a very solid crossover/SUV border lining a luxurious car.

1. Appearance: The 2019 Volvo XC 40 is a very handsome looking compact SUV. It is the smallest version of the Volvo SUV and it seems a good crossover for ""SUV beginners"" like me. I like the fact that it is not too tall which would make entry a challenge.
Everything on the outside points to a very well thought off design. I was a little surprised that the placement of the side mirror on the side door is not a little bit further to the front. Because of this further back placement, when the driver looks at the side view mirror, there is a gap between the vehicle body and the mirror, which to me is a little annoying and takes a little getting used to.

2. Performance: The 2.0 liter turbocharged four cylinder 248-hp engine, 8 speed auto transmission is impressive. Just a little push on the gas and it goes from zero to sixty in about 7 seconds. The handling is nimble and almost sporty. The powertrain is quick and responsive but it has an annoying start and stop system. As with most newer cars, when you stop, the XC 40 idles the engine completely down to a point that the engine is shut off. This system would cause an abrupt jerking when restarting. The SUV would lurch forward when starting up from a stop light. It takes a while getting used to but I found out that it is better to release the brakes and wait two second before applying acceleration to avoid the lurching.

3. Safety: The XC 40 is loaded with the safety features found in luxury cars and as always, Volvo is synonymous with safety. ABS, traction, and stability control comes standard along with Volvo's City Safety package. This includes automatic emergency braking along with sensors to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and other city perils in the vehicle’s path. It includes adaptive cruise control; forward collision warning; lane departure warning; blind spot warning (on the side mirrors); and rear cross-traffic alert making it the most complete crash avoidance system you can get. The optional Pilot Assist / driver assistance system is impressive. I tested it one evening and found that the system has good judgement identifying lane markings and responding to vehicles surrounding us. As a pilot I am not a stranger in trusting an ""autopilot"" system but with a car, because of the visualization interpretation, I would not be very comfortable trusting it 100%. For example, in NY the presence of highway construction means lanes are repainted so multiple crossing lanes would just confuse the pilot assist. So I would use it only on long distance good quality highways. The adaptive cruise control is convenient. It slows the vehicle during traffic slowdowns, and even stop the car to resume progress all on its own. With the addition of daylight running light of beautiful LEDs, all these safety features will give you a handsome insurance discount.

4. Ergonomics: In this department Volvo did not fare very well in my opinion. The human interface of the controls of this car is not always logical. For starters, the gear/transmission shifter it's horrible. It requires a two-step action. For example, to engage reverse or drive, one must move the gear selector twice; one to the back, then in the appropriate direction to select drive or reverse. This is extremely annoying during parking maneuvers and is very frustrating. Of course the argument could be that I should use the automated parking assistance but the shifter is just very unnatural for drivers. While you can operate almost every control from the steering wheel and the voice recognition is a nice
 addition, the central control screen is extremely convoluted and requires a high degree of learning curve. Coming from Volvo, particularly because it sees itself as a safety brand, the central control screen is just unsafe because it is almost impossible to operate safely while driving. There are too many unintuitive multiple taps, swipes and scrolls necessary to navigate the system. In addition, the system is awfully slow to respond. For example, changing a driver profile can take over a minute to load. If there are two things requiring a redesign, it would be the shifter and the control screen. The goal obviously should be to reduce the distraction and the precious seconds’ loss with eyes off the road to do basic functions as changing cabin temperature and audio source.

volvo,xc40,2018,Rebecca Caldwell, 07/18/2018,"Brilliant small SUV, perfect if a few tweaks",5,"July 2020: still in love with the xc40. Lease is up next year and already reserved my electric version of the xc40. 
January 2020: still in love with this car. No new concerns or issues. 
Update July 2019: 1 year later and I still love my Volvo. The issues I listed a year ago, while not big issues, remain (except the moonroof screen issue... Volvo was able to correct the problem) and I would love to see them resolved in the next model. Nothing I have found would prevent me from either keeping the model I have or buying the next model. I am an absolute convert to the Volvo brand with this little SUV. 
I have owned Toyotas, Hondas, Fords, Subarus and Chevy's (this is my first Volvo but my 19th vehicle). This is BY FAR my favorite. Let me qualify my review by saying I have no kids and rarely take passengers other than a couple large dogs so wanted an AWD SUV that was compact but did not lack any of the larger SUV perks and got good gas mileage while still having get-up-and-go. This is the only SUV I found that gives you the same options as the larger SUVs (I'm a gadget snob) while still giving you a decent size engine to get you there as quick as you want with good gas mileage (for an SUV). This does every bit of what I was looking for and does it in still. It is truly a fun car to drive and am so happy I got it. The pros FAR FAR FAR FAR outweigh any of the petty first-world issues I have come across, most of which are to be expected on a first-model year vehicle. The only issues I can find are as follows: 
CELL PHONE CHARGING: 1) The wireless charger is pretty useless as there is no ventilation in the compartment so it overheats within minutes, 2) with a larger phone (I have a Note 8) you cannot wirelessly charge the phone and use Android Auto (which requires you to use a cable) as there isn't enough physical space, 3) the port to use Android Auto is not fast charging so if you cannot use the wireless charger while using Android Auto, you essentially cannot charge your phone, 4) the only fast charging port in the vehicle is the USB-C facing the rear seats in the center console; 
LANE KEEP: 1) I find myself ""fighting"" the lane keep assistant as it picks up cracks in the road and is a bit hyper-sensitive at times, even set on the lowest/mildest setting; 
PANORAMIC MOONROOF: 1) uses a multi-function button that can be overly sensitive and opens things you didn't intend, 2) the screen doesn't always close completely, which may be in part due to the multi-function button trying to open the vent end of the moonroof; 
DRIVING MODE SETTINGS: 1) The XC40 allows you to set and save individual driving settings (everything from seats to display appearances and driving preferences) and recognizes the driver by the key fob used but, even with this, you still have to change the driving mode setting every time you get in the car (eco mode, performance, etc) - you would think you could make that a default setting with the others; and, finally 
A/C: 1) other manufacturers have vehicles that do not start air blowing from vents until the air coming out is cool (for A/C) or warm (for heat) but Volvo does not do this so went you turn on the A/C you get outside temp air until the system blows it through and gets to the cool/warm air. 
OVERALL IMPRESSION: I love this SUV and with a few minor tweaks think it could be the perfect car. I look forward to seeing the coming model years and the perfection that is sure to come.
UPDATE  January 2019: After driving the xc40 for 8 months I can say I like it as much or more than when I wrote this. The minor issues still should be improved in future models but it doesn't change my love for this fun and exciting little suv. Can't wait to see this model with the little bugs worked out!

volvo,xc40,2018,Anna, 04/06/2018,Incredible sporty SUV,5,"Volvo really thought of everything for this car. Ladies -- sick of your purse flying around on the passenger's side while you drive? No worries, there's a hook for that, and more shopping bag hooks in the cargo area to keep bags from rolling around with their contents. The car is nearly silent on your average road. Just the slight hum of acceleration, but there is remarkably little wind or road noise, even on the bumpiest, loudest roads. In fact, people I talk to on the phone joke that they know exactly when I'm maneuvering the car because they can hear things that are normally hidden by the white noise of the engine and road. We found the infotainment system to be very logically designed. It functions very similarly to a smartphone. In fact, the settings quick access buttons on the touchscreen feel very reminiscent of the android pull-down settings menu. After a week, using it feels very natural. My one gripe is that I wish the 360 camera were easier to access quickly. It will appear automatically when it senses I'm parking between two cars, but when I'm pulling into my very tight garage or straight into a parking spot, I have to manually pull it up. Not a big deal -- just takes 2 seconds, but hopefully there will be a shortcut option on future iterations. Auto-park is wonderfully helpful for tight spaces. The upgraded sound system is excellent -- coming from an audiophile. The self-driving features are wonderful for the highway and really serve to reduce fatigue by keeping you in the lane and following the car in front of you at a given distance. We really enjoy the highly customizable driver profiles that can both be programmed to a specific key and overridden through the settings menu. One thing that I found slightly annoying in city traffic was that by default, the auto parking brake enabled at every full stop. This results in a bit of a ""jerking"" when you press the gas pedal, as the brake un-engages and the engine re-starts. I disabled the feature and it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I can certainly see how this feature would be useful for hilly areas where you don't want to roll forward or backwards if you lighten up on the brakes. The back seat has more room than any other car in this class that we test drove. It feels more like a mid-sized SUV in terms of space and seat elevation. After reading a ton of reviews online, I have to say that most reviewers' gripes about this car are really non-issues in the long-run. We specifically looked out for all of the things that were identified as possible cons and haven't actually been able to identify many of them as real cons since we've been driving the car regularly. Bottom line: It's a really solid, well-designed car that's a lot of fun to drive and handle.

volvo,xc40,2018,Pam, 10/18/2018,Still love my little XC40 T5,5,"The body style was what caught my eye initially and had seen it for the first time on a commercial of all things.  Looked at other brands (Toyota, Honda, Subaru) before deciding I would at least like to see the XC40 in person.  Once I test drove it, I was in love.  It feels good driving it.  I like a boxier body type but this is a little boxy with a punch of style.  I've had mine now for 3 months and not one issue.  I feel it has very good visibility and love the blind spot monitoring.  The back up camera is good quality.  Very good acceleration, shifts smoothly, more than enough power (no issues if I have to punch it) and good storage for the size of the vehicle.  I wasn't after another Highlander so this was a good size for my needs.  So far, I'm averaging 28.5 mpg.  The console tablet I feel was very easy to get used to and use and I'm not the most tech savvy person.   The interior is sleek and simple, and I mean simple in a VERY positive way....it is not busy.  The LED lights are wonderful at night.  I am not a younger driver but do not feel the T5 is not too youthful nor do I feel it is an ""older person's"" looking SUV.  I feel it has a style of it's own and has a classy, fresh look.  I did not opt for navigation so I cannot speak to this.  The ride is very comfortable.  I did not purchase the higher end XC40 but feel I have many, many, options that most brands would not offer unless you went with the top of the trim level line.  Mine is black and a solid color.  Cabin noise is minimal for a 4 cylinder unlike some other brands I test drove.  Takes turns well and seems to hug the curves strongly.  For what this vehicle was designed for, I feel it meets the goal very well.  Very pleased with my purchase!

volvo,xc40,2018,MsDedo, 10/14/2018,Unbelievable Problems,1,"Only 10 reviews posted, and it’s unbelievable to read one that is describing the exact problem that I’m having. I’ve worked long and hard to afford this vehicle. I was so excited when I signed on that dotted line for my first Volvo!  Imagine my disappointment of having owned the car less than two weeks abd receivjng a “SRS airbag warning “urgent” take to workshop” message.  Surely, this is a serious safety concern. I have taken the car to the dealership 3 times (it’s there now) and they still cannot fix the problem—I’m about to pay my first car note on a car that I’ve barely been able to drive. Their excuse is that this is new technology, we’re still learning and we’re looking into it (REALLY)??? Apparently this is a known issue, but Volvo isn’t owning up to it. This is absolutely unacceptable and Volvo should replace my car but of course I’m not getting any proper recourse.
"
volvo,xc40,2018,Chelsea, 09/25/2018,So dissapointing,1,"This is my first Volvo, I was so excited for it to arrive after ordering it earlier this year. It's a beautiful car, sporty, technology rich, but holy hell -- the problems I've had in the few short months I've owned it are not okay. Within a week, I received a notification the airbag system had failed. They replaced the sensor, same problem came back two weeks later. They had my car for almost a month trying to fix it. Now, a month later, same sensor has failed, I get notifications about the brake system failing, one tire pressure sensor is faulty, and various interior panels keep popping off. Working with Volvo right now to get them to buy my car back as part of Michigan's lemon law, so disappointing. I will never buy a Volvo again.
"
volvo,xc40,2018,Frank, 12/24/2018,Better than I imagined!,4,"This crossover has all the latest safety and technology features as you build the car with option packages as most of the upscale brands do. Having driven a Subaru Outback (2007) and a leased CrossTrek (2015-18) with complete satisfaction for what they are, we wanted to step up to a premium brand that was not Audi or Mercedes (overrated anyway). Our goal was to find  a vehicle in the same size (length) as the XTrek with the latest tech/safety features, and the XC40 fits to a T. My biggest disagreement with Edmunds and other reviews is that the Interface/technology screen is NO MORE difficult than learning how to use your new iphone or android/apple ipad. Fortunately I am not tall so the back seat doesn’t affect me at all.
"
volvo,xc40,2018,Simon, 03/29/2019,Just a few of my favorite things,5,"Everyone has said all there is to say about the main features of this car, so I'll just say a few of my favorite things that unless you get to spend a lot of time with the car, you might overlook.  1.  They really have thought of everything when it comes to storage on this car.  For example, (the Edmunds reviewer missed these little ""Easter Eggs"") under the drivers seat is a discreet tray that slides forward to hid valuables like wallet, phone, checkbook, anything flat.  The tray locks closed so it won't slide out unintentionally and you can't even see it when it's closed.  You have to feel for it.  Also, under the passenger seat is a ""shelf"" that is perfectly sized to hold the owners manual packet.  This means you can free up the entire A/C cooled glove box for anything you want to keep cool.  2.  The headlights are one of my favorite things and a pleasant surprise for how well they perform considering I didn't test drive at night.  They turn with the steering wheel to illuminate any curves you might be heading into.  They also have an auto on/off feature for the high beams.  I live on rural roads, so I use high beams frequently. 
 With one twist of the controls on the stem next to the steering wheel, it activates the high beams.  When there is an oncoming car, the system automatically dims the high beams and then when the other car has passed the high beams come back on automatically.  This even works if you come up behind a car in the same lane you are in.  It is perfectly calibrated so I never have to override the settings.  3.  I like to use the paddle shifters to downshift and save wear on the brakes.  After manually shifting, you can just keep driving in whichever gear you left it in and when the RPM's become unstable for the gear you are driving in it will automatically revert to the correct gear and resume the automatic transmission.  4.  No gas cap!  Just open the gas door, stick the nozzle in, gas up, and shut the gas door when full.  No fumbling with a dirty gas cap.  5.  Rear view mirror.  I don't notice much appreciation for the design of the mirror.  Can you call a rearview mirror sexy?  I just did.  6. The resolution on the cameras, especially on the huge display screen is crisp and beautiful.  The 360 degree camera (uses 4 cameras around the car to give an aerial view including surroundings) is such a cool feature.  There is no excuse to park bad in this car.  I think I'll stop there, but I could go on.
"
volvo,xc40,2018,Kelly, 08/16/2018,Perfect Small SUV,5,"We love this car.  It's our first Volvo.  Really like the adaptive cruise control, auto high beam headlights that move with the steering wheel, heated steering wheel, the panoramic sunroof that has a self-closing shade when the car gets too hot.  I find the layout of the controls to be very intuitive.  Love the touch screen with simple home button just like a tablet.  It's small with a tight turning radius that makes it easy to maneuver.  The back storage is brilliant with easy ability to subdivide to keep things from rolling around.  It remembers the side mirrors position along with the seat position for each driver.  Didn't think I'd care about it, but like the different driving modes; regularly change it between Comfort, Dynamic and Eco.  I get better than the EPA gas mileage. Oh, and it has a built in trash can.  Seriously, why doesn't every car have that?
"
volvo,xc40,2018,AliciaW, 10/15/2018,Disappointed😡,3,"I had this car a few short months and the engine light has already come on. The gas mileage indicator increases and decreases at any given time. The engine is also a little noisy. I called about having the car serviced and was told it may be something with the emissions. Either way this should not be happening with a new vehicle. Now I have to wait a whole week before the problem can even be addressed. 😡

volvo,xc40,2018,Henry Be, 12/21/2018,Volvotastic!,5,"The Volvo XC40 is a great car that packs quality, performance and style in a pleasing little SUV package. This is our 6th Volvo and it is one of the best in quality, ride and handling. My wife absolutely loves this vehicle. She is petite but has no problems getting in and out of the vehicle, finding the best seating position and comfortably driving the vehicle. Likewise, she thinks Volvo has the most ergonomic seats in the world. She has back issues but they are never aggravated driving this vehicle for  both long and short distances.  I concur with her opinions and would add that the XC40’s performance and handling are great.  It’s not a Porsche but the turbo-4 (T5) can move when it’s necessary to pass or break free from a band of pokey drivers. Interior design and quality are pleasing and comfortable. Volvo has always given special attention to safety and minimalist design - it’s a Swedish hallmark that makes Volvo’s unique and dependable.  In short, a good buy if you’re looking for style, dependability and quality performance.
"
volvo,xc40,2018,Raoul Watson, 01/11/2019,An Awesome Compact SUV - part 2,4,"(Due to restrictive text length this review has two parts, this is part 2, see part 1 prior to reading this)                                                                                                
                   5. Interior and Comfort: The big front seats are roomy and plush. It can have seat ventilation/AC and seat warmer and heated steering wheel, and heated side mirrors. The automatic dual-zone system performed well. Fit and finish are exceptional, and the combination of black nappa leather and suede seat inserts. The seats are supportive beneath and comfortable on long trips. The seats also have plenty of adjustments, including generous fore-aft range and adjustable lumbar / lower-back support. 2 memory buttons allows you to record your favorite positions. It comes in handy when you pick up your car from service only to find out the person driving had changed all your settings. I was a little surprised at the lack of head room. I am by no means a tall individual but with my 5'10"" stature, I have bumped my head in the driver's seat multiple times as I lean forward. I also find myself continuously snagging the panel with my shoes on my left foot when trying to position it on the foot rest in the left front side.

Two adults will be very comfortable in the rear seats. I was able to cross my leg comfortably in the rear seat. There's plenty of knee and feet room. Three adults will fit side by side, but the center seat is rather tight and a very pronounced center tunnel consumes leg and foot room from the person in the middle. 

The rear trunk is surprisingly spacious with automated way to fold the rear seats. All my previous cars have been of the station wagon type of body since I have always been the interstate mover for my three children college moves. I was pleased to see the trunk size. 

6. Technology: This car is loaded with technology too much to list. In addition to all the safety technology features listed above, the car comes with the On call system and Xirius radio for free trial. Once you use these, you probably would like to keep the convenience. Did you know that this car has its own Wi-Fi hotspot? In addition, it has an inductive phone charger so that you can just drop a compatible phone to charge it wirelessly. An app called ""Volvo On Call"" is available for your smart phone where you can perform functions from your phone (lock/unlock doors, start/stop engine). The app also has navigation map that once you found an address you can send it to your vehicle. I was a little disappointed to only find two USB ports. With current day technology, by the time you use one to charge your non inductive phone, one for a USB with MP 3 music, you no longer have a spare for dashcam or a secondary person needing to charge a non-inductive phone.

The XC 40 ride is comfortable but can be a little stiff sometimes. There are several ""Driver Mode"" selectable such as Comfort and Eco but none of those affected the shock absorbers. The noise level is reasonably low and the handling is responsive. While the XC 40 model is by far not the most fuel economical model, the average 23 mpg overall can be a little pricey since the engine requires a premium high octane (98) fuel. However, it is still impressive for such a strong engine.

My biggest gripe with the technology is that the most important contact between the car and the road, which is its tires, does not have the ability to provide continuous tire pressure monitoring system. I am not talking about a TPMS which tells you a tire is low and needs attention, but rather a system which displays tire pressure in PSI of all tires, at all times.


In closing, I did miss the small rubber Swedish flag attached to the car’s left front flank which I saw at Javits Center during a car show but apparently removed from my production line.

volvo,xc40,2018,Carlos, 11/29/2019,"Problems with reverse camera, cs unresponsive",2,"I have had some problems with the reverse camera. Sometimes it shows in black, sometimes it doesn’t open at all. It is a 2020 XC40 with 3 months in use, and after attempting to contact costumer service apparently the camera is expected to have a delay of 2-3 minutes, something unheard of for me. I do have the email support for that statement which doesn’t seem to be in the specs of the cars. In any case it used to work properly for the first three months, it’s just sad the brand don’t even aim to fix its defects

volvo,xc40,2018,WVgirl, 09/12/2019,So much to love...but problems,3,"I love this car more than any I've ever had, but during the first year I've had it there have been 2 recalls.  I had to have all the brake pads replaced due to corrosion and the check engine light came on this week. It has something to do with emissions and the mass air flow. The suspension is also out of whack and my car will be in the shop all weekend because they can't identify the problem in the suspension.  If I've had this many problems with less than 25k miles, I'm scared what will happen after it's out of warranty. I like that it's very nimble and has a unique look. I have to wait about 30 seconds after I turn the car to make any changes to the radio or try to use my phone. It will completely freeze without adequate ""warm up"" time.

volvo,xc40,2018,WilliamC, 02/22/2019,Atlanta to Key West to Atlanta Wow!,5,"My wife traded in her 2015 Porsche Macan S for this 2019 Volvo XC40 and I was not happy, at first.  She said that she adored the color combinations of Amazon Blue and white top.  We took it on the road beginning in Atlanta headed for Key West.  The rain poured on our first day and the XC40 performed wonderfully.  The exceleration was not Porsche like, but it did well on the open road of 75 S.  The color that my wife loved so much was enhanced by the waters of Key West.  Women were taking pictures of her car like it was a museum piece or a Louis Vuitton ladies purse.  The oohs and ahhs were contagious.  It wasn't until Naples that I realized the ""Auto-pilot"" feature.  I was able to drive straight from Naples to Atlanta without feeling fatigued.  The XC40 on auto-pilot at 70 mph's held true to the road and let me know all that I needed to know to be safe.  The tracking was incredible.  In closing, I like this car and when I go into the garage, I called her ""Pretty Girl"", my pet name for just about everything that I like.  For me to write about a car like this is a one off, so don't take my words lightly, drive one for yourself.

I always wanted a Volvo but always was apprehensive due to design and reliability reports from owners. The 2019 XC 40 however, seems to be a very solid crossover/SUV border lining a luxurious car.

1. Appearance: The 2019 Volvo XC 40 is a very handsome looking compact SUV. It is the smallest version of the Volvo SUV and it seems a good crossover for ""SUV beginners"" like me. I like the fact that it is not too tall which would make entry a challenge.
Everything on the outside points to a very well thought off design. I was a little surprised that the placement of the side mirror on the side door is not a little bit further to the front. Because of this further back placement, when the driver looks at the side view mirror, there is a gap between the vehicle body and the mirror, which to me is a little annoying and takes a little getting used to.

2. Performance: The 2.0 liter turbocharged four cylinder 248-hp engine, 8 speed auto transmission is impressive. Just a little push on the gas and it goes from zero to sixty in about 7 seconds. The handling is nimble and almost sporty. The powertrain is quick and responsive but it has an annoying start and stop system. As with most newer cars, when you stop, the XC 40 idles the engine completely down to a point that the engine is shut off. This system would cause an abrupt jerking when restarting. The SUV would lurch forward when starting up from a stop light. It takes a while getting used to but I found out that it is better to release the brakes and wait two second before applying acceleration to avoid the lurching.

3. Safety: The XC 40 is loaded with the safety features found in luxury cars and as always, Volvo is synonymous with safety. ABS, traction, and stability control comes standard along with Volvo's City Safety package. This includes automatic emergency braking along with sensors to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and other city perils in the vehicle’s path. It includes adaptive cruise control; forward collision warning; lane departure warning; blind spot warning (on the side mirrors); and rear cross-traffic alert making it the most complete crash avoidance system you can get. The optional Pilot Assist / driver assistance system is impressive. I tested it one evening and found that the system has good judgement identifying lane markings and responding to vehicles surrounding us. As a pilot I am not a stranger in trusting an ""autopilot"" system but with a car, because of the visualization interpretation, I would not be very comfortable trusting it 100%. For example, in NY the presence of highway construction means lanes are repainted so multiple crossing lanes would just confuse the pilot assist. So I would use it only on long distance good quality highways. The adaptive cruise control is convenient. It slows the vehicle during traffic slowdowns, and even stop the car to resume progress all on its own. With the addition of daylight running light of beautiful LEDs, all these safety features will give you a handsome insurance discount.

4. Ergonomics: In this department Volvo did not fare very well in my opinion. The human interface of the controls of this car is not always logical. For starters, the gear/transmission shifter it's horrible. It requires a two-step action. For example, to engage reverse or drive, one must move the gear selector twice; one to the back, then in the appropriate direction to select drive or reverse. This is extremely annoying during parking maneuvers and is very frustrating. Of course the argument could be that I should use the automated parking assistance but the shifter is just very unnatural for drivers. While you can operate almost every control from the steering wheel and the voice recognition is a nice
 addition, the central control screen is extremely convoluted and requires a high degree of learning curve. Coming from Volvo, particularly because it sees itself as a safety brand, the central control screen is just unsafe because it is almost impossible to operate safely while driving. There are too many unintuitive multiple taps, swipes and scrolls necessary to navigate the system. In addition, the system is awfully slow to respond. For example, changing a driver profile can take over a minute to load. If there are two things requiring a redesign, it would be the shifter and the control screen. The goal obviously should be to reduce the distraction and the precious seconds’ loss with eyes off the road to do basic functions as changing cabin temperature and audio source.

volvo,xc40,2019,Rebecca Caldwell, 07/18/2018,"Brilliant small SUV, perfect if a few tweaks",5,"July 2020: still in love with the xc40. Lease is up next year and already reserved my electric version of the xc40. 
January 2020: still in love with this car. No new concerns or issues. 
Update July 2019: 1 year later and I still love my Volvo. The issues I listed a year ago, while not big issues, remain (except the moonroof screen issue... Volvo was able to correct the problem) and I would love to see them resolved in the next model. Nothing I have found would prevent me from either keeping the model I have or buying the next model. I am an absolute convert to the Volvo brand with this little SUV. 
I have owned Toyotas, Hondas, Fords, Subarus and Chevy's (this is my first Volvo but my 19th vehicle). This is BY FAR my favorite. Let me qualify my review by saying I have no kids and rarely take passengers other than a couple large dogs so wanted an AWD SUV that was compact but did not lack any of the larger SUV perks and got good gas mileage while still having get-up-and-go. This is the only SUV I found that gives you the same options as the larger SUVs (I'm a gadget snob) while still giving you a decent size engine to get you there as quick as you want with good gas mileage (for an SUV). This does every bit of what I was looking for and does it in still. It is truly a fun car to drive and am so happy I got it. The pros FAR FAR FAR FAR outweigh any of the petty first-world issues I have come across, most of which are to be expected on a first-model year vehicle. The only issues I can find are as follows: 
CELL PHONE CHARGING: 1) The wireless charger is pretty useless as there is no ventilation in the compartment so it overheats within minutes, 2) with a larger phone (I have a Note 8) you cannot wirelessly charge the phone and use Android Auto (which requires you to use a cable) as there isn't enough physical space, 3) the port to use Android Auto is not fast charging so if you cannot use the wireless charger while using Android Auto, you essentially cannot charge your phone, 4) the only fast charging port in the vehicle is the USB-C facing the rear seats in the center console; 
LANE KEEP: 1) I find myself ""fighting"" the lane keep assistant as it picks up cracks in the road and is a bit hyper-sensitive at times, even set on the lowest/mildest setting; 
PANORAMIC MOONROOF: 1) uses a multi-function button that can be overly sensitive and opens things you didn't intend, 2) the screen doesn't always close completely, which may be in part due to the multi-function button trying to open the vent end of the moonroof; 
DRIVING MODE SETTINGS: 1) The XC40 allows you to set and save individual driving settings (everything from seats to display appearances and driving preferences) and recognizes the driver by the key fob used but, even with this, you still have to change the driving mode setting every time you get in the car (eco mode, performance, etc) - you would think you could make that a default setting with the others; and, finally 
A/C: 1) other manufacturers have vehicles that do not start air blowing from vents until the air coming out is cool (for A/C) or warm (for heat) but Volvo does not do this so went you turn on the A/C you get outside temp air until the system blows it through and gets to the cool/warm air. 
OVERALL IMPRESSION: I love this SUV and with a few minor tweaks think it could be the perfect car. I look forward to seeing the coming model years and the perfection that is sure to come.
UPDATE  January 2019: After driving the xc40 for 8 months I can say I like it as much or more than when I wrote this. The minor issues still should be improved in future models but it doesn't change my love for this fun and exciting little suv. Can't wait to see this model with the little bugs worked out!

volvo,xc40,2019,Anna, 04/06/2018,Incredible sporty SUV,5,"Volvo really thought of everything for this car. Ladies -- sick of your purse flying around on the passenger's side while you drive? No worries, there's a hook for that, and more shopping bag hooks in the cargo area to keep bags from rolling around with their contents. The car is nearly silent on your average road. Just the slight hum of acceleration, but there is remarkably little wind or road noise, even on the bumpiest, loudest roads. In fact, people I talk to on the phone joke that they know exactly when I'm maneuvering the car because they can hear things that are normally hidden by the white noise of the engine and road. We found the infotainment system to be very logically designed. It functions very similarly to a smartphone. In fact, the settings quick access buttons on the touchscreen feel very reminiscent of the android pull-down settings menu. After a week, using it feels very natural. My one gripe is that I wish the 360 camera were easier to access quickly. It will appear automatically when it senses I'm parking between two cars, but when I'm pulling into my very tight garage or straight into a parking spot, I have to manually pull it up. Not a big deal -- just takes 2 seconds, but hopefully there will be a shortcut option on future iterations. Auto-park is wonderfully helpful for tight spaces. The upgraded sound system is excellent -- coming from an audiophile. The self-driving features are wonderful for the highway and really serve to reduce fatigue by keeping you in the lane and following the car in front of you at a given distance. We really enjoy the highly customizable driver profiles that can both be programmed to a specific key and overridden through the settings menu. One thing that I found slightly annoying in city traffic was that by default, the auto parking brake enabled at every full stop. This results in a bit of a ""jerking"" when you press the gas pedal, as the brake un-engages and the engine re-starts. I disabled the feature and it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I can certainly see how this feature would be useful for hilly areas where you don't want to roll forward or backwards if you lighten up on the brakes. The back seat has more room than any other car in this class that we test drove. It feels more like a mid-sized SUV in terms of space and seat elevation. After reading a ton of reviews online, I have to say that most reviewers' gripes about this car are really non-issues in the long-run. We specifically looked out for all of the things that were identified as possible cons and haven't actually been able to identify many of them as real cons since we've been driving the car regularly. Bottom line: It's a really solid, well-designed car that's a lot of fun to drive and handle.

volvo,xc40,2019,Pam, 10/18/2018,Still love my little XC40 T5,5,"The body style was what caught my eye initially and had seen it for the first time on a commercial of all things.  Looked at other brands (Toyota, Honda, Subaru) before deciding I would at least like to see the XC40 in person.  Once I test drove it, I was in love.  It feels good driving it.  I like a boxier body type but this is a little boxy with a punch of style.  I've had mine now for 3 months and not one issue.  I feel it has very good visibility and love the blind spot monitoring.  The back up camera is good quality.  Very good acceleration, shifts smoothly, more than enough power (no issues if I have to punch it) and good storage for the size of the vehicle.  I wasn't after another Highlander so this was a good size for my needs.  So far, I'm averaging 28.5 mpg.  The console tablet I feel was very easy to get used to and use and I'm not the most tech savvy person.   The interior is sleek and simple, and I mean simple in a VERY positive way....it is not busy.  The LED lights are wonderful at night.  I am not a younger driver but do not feel the T5 is not too youthful nor do I feel it is an ""older person's"" looking SUV.  I feel it has a style of it's own and has a classy, fresh look.  I did not opt for navigation so I cannot speak to this.  The ride is very comfortable.  I did not purchase the higher end XC40 but feel I have many, many, options that most brands would not offer unless you went with the top of the trim level line.  Mine is black and a solid color.  Cabin noise is minimal for a 4 cylinder unlike some other brands I test drove.  Takes turns well and seems to hug the curves strongly.  For what this vehicle was designed for, I feel it meets the goal very well.  Very pleased with my purchase!

volvo,xc40,2019,MsDedo, 10/14/2018,Unbelievable Problems,1,"Only 10 reviews posted, and it’s unbelievable to read one that is describing the exact problem that I’m having. I’ve worked long and hard to afford this vehicle. I was so excited when I signed on that dotted line for my first Volvo!  Imagine my disappointment of having owned the car less than two weeks abd receivjng a “SRS airbag warning “urgent” take to workshop” message.  Surely, this is a serious safety concern. I have taken the car to the dealership 3 times (it’s there now) and they still cannot fix the problem—I’m about to pay my first car note on a car that I’ve barely been able to drive. Their excuse is that this is new technology, we’re still learning and we’re looking into it (REALLY)??? Apparently this is a known issue, but Volvo isn’t owning up to it. This is absolutely unacceptable and Volvo should replace my car but of course I’m not getting any proper recourse.
"
volvo,xc40,2019,Chelsea, 09/25/2018,So dissapointing,1,"This is my first Volvo, I was so excited for it to arrive after ordering it earlier this year. It's a beautiful car, sporty, technology rich, but holy hell -- the problems I've had in the few short months I've owned it are not okay. Within a week, I received a notification the airbag system had failed. They replaced the sensor, same problem came back two weeks later. They had my car for almost a month trying to fix it. Now, a month later, same sensor has failed, I get notifications about the brake system failing, one tire pressure sensor is faulty, and various interior panels keep popping off. Working with Volvo right now to get them to buy my car back as part of Michigan's lemon law, so disappointing. I will never buy a Volvo again.
"
volvo,xc40,2019,Frank, 12/24/2018,Better than I imagined!,4,"This crossover has all the latest safety and technology features as you build the car with option packages as most of the upscale brands do. Having driven a Subaru Outback (2007) and a leased CrossTrek (2015-18) with complete satisfaction for what they are, we wanted to step up to a premium brand that was not Audi or Mercedes (overrated anyway). Our goal was to find  a vehicle in the same size (length) as the XTrek with the latest tech/safety features, and the XC40 fits to a T. My biggest disagreement with Edmunds and other reviews is that the Interface/technology screen is NO MORE difficult than learning how to use your new iphone or android/apple ipad. Fortunately I am not tall so the back seat doesn’t affect me at all.
"
volvo,xc40,2019,Simon, 03/29/2019,Just a few of my favorite things,5,"Everyone has said all there is to say about the main features of this car, so I'll just say a few of my favorite things that unless you get to spend a lot of time with the car, you might overlook.  1.  They really have thought of everything when it comes to storage on this car.  For example, (the Edmunds reviewer missed these little ""Easter Eggs"") under the drivers seat is a discreet tray that slides forward to hid valuables like wallet, phone, checkbook, anything flat.  The tray locks closed so it won't slide out unintentionally and you can't even see it when it's closed.  You have to feel for it.  Also, under the passenger seat is a ""shelf"" that is perfectly sized to hold the owners manual packet.  This means you can free up the entire A/C cooled glove box for anything you want to keep cool.  2.  The headlights are one of my favorite things and a pleasant surprise for how well they perform considering I didn't test drive at night.  They turn with the steering wheel to illuminate any curves you might be heading into.  They also have an auto on/off feature for the high beams.  I live on rural roads, so I use high beams frequently. 
 With one twist of the controls on the stem next to the steering wheel, it activates the high beams.  When there is an oncoming car, the system automatically dims the high beams and then when the other car has passed the high beams come back on automatically.  This even works if you come up behind a car in the same lane you are in.  It is perfectly calibrated so I never have to override the settings.  3.  I like to use the paddle shifters to downshift and save wear on the brakes.  After manually shifting, you can just keep driving in whichever gear you left it in and when the RPM's become unstable for the gear you are driving in it will automatically revert to the correct gear and resume the automatic transmission.  4.  No gas cap!  Just open the gas door, stick the nozzle in, gas up, and shut the gas door when full.  No fumbling with a dirty gas cap.  5.  Rear view mirror.  I don't notice much appreciation for the design of the mirror.  Can you call a rearview mirror sexy?  I just did.  6. The resolution on the cameras, especially on the huge display screen is crisp and beautiful.  The 360 degree camera (uses 4 cameras around the car to give an aerial view including surroundings) is such a cool feature.  There is no excuse to park bad in this car.  I think I'll stop there, but I could go on.
"
volvo,xc40,2019,Kelly, 08/16/2018,Perfect Small SUV,5,"We love this car.  It's our first Volvo.  Really like the adaptive cruise control, auto high beam headlights that move with the steering wheel, heated steering wheel, the panoramic sunroof that has a self-closing shade when the car gets too hot.  I find the layout of the controls to be very intuitive.  Love the touch screen with simple home button just like a tablet.  It's small with a tight turning radius that makes it easy to maneuver.  The back storage is brilliant with easy ability to subdivide to keep things from rolling around.  It remembers the side mirrors position along with the seat position for each driver.  Didn't think I'd care about it, but like the different driving modes; regularly change it between Comfort, Dynamic and Eco.  I get better than the EPA gas mileage. Oh, and it has a built in trash can.  Seriously, why doesn't every car have that?
"
volvo,xc40,2019,AliciaW, 10/15/2018,Disappointed😡,3,"I had this car a few short months and the engine light has already come on. The gas mileage indicator increases and decreases at any given time. The engine is also a little noisy. I called about having the car serviced and was told it may be something with the emissions. Either way this should not be happening with a new vehicle. Now I have to wait a whole week before the problem can even be addressed. 😡

volvo,xc40,2019,Henry Be, 12/21/2018,Volvotastic!,5,"The Volvo XC40 is a great car that packs quality, performance and style in a pleasing little SUV package. This is our 6th Volvo and it is one of the best in quality, ride and handling. My wife absolutely loves this vehicle. She is petite but has no problems getting in and out of the vehicle, finding the best seating position and comfortably driving the vehicle. Likewise, she thinks Volvo has the most ergonomic seats in the world. She has back issues but they are never aggravated driving this vehicle for  both long and short distances.  I concur with her opinions and would add that the XC40’s performance and handling are great.  It’s not a Porsche but the turbo-4 (T5) can move when it’s necessary to pass or break free from a band of pokey drivers. Interior design and quality are pleasing and comfortable. Volvo has always given special attention to safety and minimalist design - it’s a Swedish hallmark that makes Volvo’s unique and dependable.  In short, a good buy if you’re looking for style, dependability and quality performance.

volvo,xc40,2019,Raoul Watson, 01/11/2019,An Awesome Compact SUV - part 2,4,"(Due to restrictive text length this review has two parts, this is part 2, see part 1 prior to reading this)                                                                                                
                   5. Interior and Comfort: The big front seats are roomy and plush. It can have seat ventilation/AC and seat warmer and heated steering wheel, and heated side mirrors. The automatic dual-zone system performed well. Fit and finish are exceptional, and the combination of black nappa leather and suede seat inserts. The seats are supportive beneath and comfortable on long trips. The seats also have plenty of adjustments, including generous fore-aft range and adjustable lumbar / lower-back support. 2 memory buttons allows you to record your favorite positions. It comes in handy when you pick up your car from service only to find out the person driving had changed all your settings. I was a little surprised at the lack of head room. I am by no means a tall individual but with my 5'10"" stature, I have bumped my head in the driver's seat multiple times as I lean forward. I also find myself continuously snagging the panel with my shoes on my left foot when trying to position it on the foot rest in the left front side.

Two adults will be very comfortable in the rear seats. I was able to cross my leg comfortably in the rear seat. There's plenty of knee and feet room. Three adults will fit side by side, but the center seat is rather tight and a very pronounced center tunnel consumes leg and foot room from the person in the middle. 

The rear trunk is surprisingly spacious with automated way to fold the rear seats. All my previous cars have been of the station wagon type of body since I have always been the interstate mover for my three children college moves. I was pleased to see the trunk size. 

6. Technology: This car is loaded with technology too much to list. In addition to all the safety technology features listed above, the car comes with the On call system and Xirius radio for free trial. Once you use these, you probably would like to keep the convenience. Did you know that this car has its own Wi-Fi hotspot? In addition, it has an inductive phone charger so that you can just drop a compatible phone to charge it wirelessly. An app called ""Volvo On Call"" is available for your smart phone where you can perform functions from your phone (lock/unlock doors, start/stop engine). The app also has navigation map that once you found an address you can send it to your vehicle. I was a little disappointed to only find two USB ports. With current day technology, by the time you use one to charge your non inductive phone, one for a USB with MP 3 music, you no longer have a spare for dashcam or a secondary person needing to charge a non-inductive phone.

The XC 40 ride is comfortable but can be a little stiff sometimes. There are several ""Driver Mode"" selectable such as Comfort and Eco but none of those affected the shock absorbers. The noise level is reasonably low and the handling is responsive. While the XC 40 model is by far not the most fuel economical model, the average 23 mpg overall can be a little pricey since the engine requires a premium high octane (98) fuel. However, it is still impressive for such a strong engine.

My biggest gripe with the technology is that the most important contact between the car and the road, which is its tires, does not have the ability to provide continuous tire pressure monitoring system. I am not talking about a TPMS which tells you a tire is low and needs attention, but rather a system which displays tire pressure in PSI of all tires, at all times.


In closing, I did miss the small rubber Swedish flag attached to the car’s left front flank which I saw at Javits Center during a car show but apparently removed from my production line.

I had to have all the brake pads replaced due to corrosion and the check engine light came on this week. It has something to do with emissions and the mass air flow. The suspension is also out of whack and my car will be in the shop all weekend because they can't identify the problem in the suspension.  If I've had this many problems with less than 25k miles, I'm scared what will happen after it's out of warranty. I like that it's very nimble and has a unique look. I have to wait about 30 seconds after I turn the car to make any changes to the radio or try to use my phone. It will completely freeze without adequate ""warm up"" time.

She said that she adored the color combinations of Amazon Blue and white top.  We took it on the road beginning in Atlanta headed for Key West.  The rain poured on our first day and the XC40 performed wonderfully.  The exceleration was not Porsche like, but it did well on the open road of 75 S.  The color that my wife loved so much was enhanced by the waters of Key West.  Women were taking pictures of her car like it was a museum piece or a Louis Vuitton ladies purse.  The oohs and ahhs were contagious.  It wasn't until Naples that I realized the ""Auto-pilot"" feature.  I was able to drive straight from Naples to Atlanta without feeling fatigued.  The XC40 on auto-pilot at 70 mph's held true to the road and let me know all that I needed to know to be safe.  The tracking was incredible.  In closing, I like this car and when I go into the garage, I called her ""Pretty Girl"", my pet name for just about everything that I like.

The car is very nicely designed, functional, fun to drive. Great engine with several driving modes to choose between performance and fuel economy. Very responsive. But what happened to Volvo quality? In under two years I had to replace rear camera, moving sunroof parts (under warranty) and a $600 out of pocket rotor replacement job with less than 30K miles on it.

Besides the obvious reputation for safety, Volvos have continued to improve their reliability, looks, and amenities over the years. The XC60 is the first Volvo SUV that I have purchased for myself. It is also the most comfortable Volvo that I have ever driven.  I was impressed with the build quality, its pep on the road, and the new features such as blind spot alerts (BLIS) and rear view camera for backing up.  The mileage is better than I expected with the 3.2L engine and the interior is dead quiet on the highway.  "

volvo,xc60,2010,woodinva, 06/01/2014,Excellence in most areas except the NAVI,4,"Purchased this vehicle as replacement for Wife's 1999 Ford Explorer (350K miles). Wanted a Boron steel cocoon for the wife, Excellent Safety rating. Xenon lights and decent gas mileage. I got that and more. Upgraded my car to Polestar rating (software upgrade)
My car came with Sirius Satellite
and currently get 20.8mpg with plus (89) gasoline with ethanol can get up to 23 mpg if I use strictly (non ethanol gas and clamp down on my lead foot!)
Navi system ( does not work efficiently but one must buy this to get backup rear camera)
Honestly.. buying a Garmin portable  the currently installed cumbersome system which requires you use a remote control & is flawed.



Update 2017:  Still own the car have 89k miles now, Volvo CPO car  (2 prior Lease owners)  Upgraded car to ""Polestar Edition Software"" option that gives the car 325bhp   More  HP then the Ford Mustang GT  of the same year which has 315!  Also changed sterring wheels to the R DESIGN steering wheel when it was discovered my car had almost all the features (interior panoramic sunroof, Adaptive Xenons & adaptive  Radar controls that only R design cars have.. Mine is only missing 20 inch wheels & badging...  Consequently I am NOT  worried about gas mileage. Changed the Pirelli Assemetric-Zero  tires over to Michelin Premier LTX tires (V speed rated) and still have spirited although ""safe driving"".  ALL of the Newer  crossovers/SUV's that are out have tried to ""copy"" ALL of the safety features included in this car!!  
Except for the dinky Navigation system in this car wouldn't trade it for the world.. In fact my phone has GPS now and I use it with the Bluetooth thats in this cars system without a problem..  Now I can't wait to see & drive the 2018 XC60 Hybrid  which might be the only model I 'might' trade up for. But given the fact that my car has one of the last Turbo 6  European Ford  powerplants in it that hasn't given me a lick of trouble and I follow all then manufacturers preventative maintenance for the vehicle  and all the current Volvo's are 4 cylinder engines [I might not trade up.]...
When not in use I bought a car cover for my XC60  and use it when i am driving my S80 sedan...


Update 104K miles November 2018  Still have this car Upgraded HP to Polestar  Level with 300HP 
Has as much HP now as the Mustang GT  !
After reading reviews of others who have had this same car, this car was waaay ahead of its time I have the version that is equivalent to the R-design without Rdesign badging or bigger wheels or a taut ride. Wouldn't trade it for the world. With AWD tracking it drives like a sports car Not a Volvo.  I have had some SVO Mustangs & am the son of a Ford dealer, I have driven lots of cars none of the small SUV's out there compare to this one...My sister has a MBGLK  and it doesn't even compare. Mine is sleeker, uses BORON steel for its passenger compartment has more Safety features (mine was built in 2009)  then waht most cars have 10 yrs later. Mine even  has city/ Safe Radar.. which will stop the car if creeping along iin traffic slowdowns if you fail to do so.  Only 1 thing I dislike about this car is the GPS system  which forces you to engage it with a seperate remote control and the car must be inb the park position.  I use my phine whuch has up to date GPS and traffic info So that problem is fixed!   Have sirius satellite and CD and port/USB for IPOD   if you like all in a 2010 model.  Will I give this car up?  Heck to the NO!   It flies aroind Audi's MB and infinitis and range rovers;  they are STUNNED  when a Volvo can out do them! lol  I am glad I got my hands on this one.  All the newer ones are 4 cylinder models  This is a European Ford Slant 6 Turbo charged...   the extra weight doesn't hurt me in the least little bit especially with snow on the ground. Now during winter I remove the aluminum alloys and go with steel wheels (if you can find them)
  17 inch rims mounted to a  winter tire like a Blizzak or Latitude ice and snow. I use those when headed to the mountains. Potholes will tear up aluminum alloy wheels. Cost you more $$ then a switchover  to your front end.   Well thats my report gonna stick with it till Volvo brings out a E car for me to be my daily driver wit5h a supercharged/turbo engine.. mayb4 in 2020  I might add another,,, Not giving this up ever!!!

volvo,xc60,2010,L. Norris, 03/15/2016,Disappointed owner,2,"I bought a new 2010 Volvo XC60 and was looking forward to many years with this car.  I took it for regular maintenance at a Volvo dealer and took very good care of it.  it was fine while under warranty for 4 years/ 50, 000.  The past year I have have had to spend over $6000 for repairs - rear differential broke, drive belt, power steering broke, brakes, electrics - it is as if the Volvo engineers designed it so that every major system would break as soon as the car was out of warranty.  I am disgusted!  It only has 60,000 miles on it and has been lovingly cared for and it has turned into an unreliable lemon!  I will never buy a Volvo again. I do not recommend this car, unless you have a lot of spare time and money to waste.

It was so bad that the dealership said that finding where it was coming from behind the dashboard could cause even worse rattles putting it back together. The loose rattles in the tailgate never were fixed from day one. The transmitter in the hatch was loose from the factory. The dealer broke 7 out of the 10 retaining clips ""fixing"" it. Popping noise in the driver's seat never fixed. Both Bliss cameras were replaced in 2 years. The power steering reservoir/lines were replaced after steering effort was erratic.

It is very comfortable and with the T6 it's quick off the line. But now at 73,000 miles I'm beginning to wonder if it's not the beginning of the end.  Brake vacuum pump needs replacing ($700), sunroof leaks during a hard rain ($500), tires cup regardless of brand apparently, leather is wearing worse than my mom's 1989 Cadillac, the lift gate pistons needed replacement (caught under warranty), brakes wear quickly ($400) and I need a new motor mount ($500).  I think that's a bit much for a Volvo with what many consider low mileage. But then again, it's really not Swedish anymore, is it?"

-Engine oil leak - new gasket was fitted
-Since the oil leak repair we have topped -up the engine oil. (still an issue?)
-False seat belt alarms (not yet resolved)
- City Stop activating twice with no obstacles in the way, terrifying my wife and two boys.

volvo,xc60,2010,Car Critic very picky , 07/30/2019,This will take me 1 million miles !,5,Not even thinking of  getting another SUV  for many many many years and miles  .  This  quality from  2010  can not be matched . Feels like a hand made  SUV  love it    the  3.0 is the way to go ! 
volvo,xc60,2010,Claire, 05/09/2016,Great car...at first....,3,"First, the good: This car was great at first.  I got it in 2010, and I got an awesome deal on it.  It was so safe, great ride...kinda heavy like a truck, but I didn't mind.  It's GREAT in the snow, I drove in horrible conditions when literally no one else was on the road because it was so awful out there, and I was 100% fine (granted I grew up driving in blizzards, so I know what I'm doing).  I've never felt safer in any other car.  The acceleration is good, the stereo is wonderful and has lots of ways to adjust it. If you are a bass person....the bass is very very good.  
Now, the bad:   I swear Volvo programs/designs these cars to be fantastic until the warranty is over.  I started having so many problems when mine was done.  The batteries kept dying, I had to get three new batteries in three years, two in an 8 month period. The electronics started acting weird, and there was a mysterious leak in the windshield that I couldn't find, and the dealerships claimed they couldn't find it either, even tho every time it rained I had water dripping down my windshield. Notice that dealerships was plural? Yeah...I went to a ton of different Volvo dealerships for maintenance due to moving around a lot....and I had problems at ALL of them.  Constantly trying to rip me off, charge me for unnecessary things...they even went as far as telling me that I needed a new timing belt....when the car has a timing chain. There is no timing belt. 
Another thing that made me think that the car was programmed to break after the warranty was over was that every time the ""regular maintenance"" notification showed up, I noticed that if I didn't take it into the dealership fast enough, things would mysteriously start breaking.  Electronics, etc. That notification is on a timer per certain amount of miles driven. It will show up no matter whats going on with the car. It made no sense, and it never happened until the warranty was over. And I've heard the same complaint from multiple other Volvo owners.
And the gas milage is terrible. I get 17 miles per gallon. Ugh.  I've heard they have improved that on the new ones tho.
I now have about $8,000 worth of things to fix on the damn thing, including the rear differential, and so needless to say I'm looking for a new car.  I will miss the Volvo...she's been thru a lot with me.  But I can't swing how expensive her repairs have been, regardless of how safe she is and how well she drives in the snow.  Volvo will try to rip you off.

Read most reviews complaining abt gas mileage & while it's not best in class it has a lot of features better than competition & after moving from a minivan there's not a lot of difference is gas mileage anyway. We narrowed choice to XC60 or Audi Q5 and both were excellent CUVs. The diff was XC60 had best value vs Q5 for same price & the XC60 drove more like a car than Q5 which felt like our minivan (a bit truck-like). Also, Volvo's safety features w/c outmatched Audi in every aspect. Q5 looked bland while XC60 looked very sexy and elegant."

The ""R Series"" really makes a difference in handling & performance.  Gas mileage is sub-par, but uses regular gas, so it's a wash.  Every single time I drive the car, heads turn - don't see many on the road which I like.  Feels incredibly solid and handles better than my 3 yr old sports sedan.  R Series interior is on par with Q5 and nicer than all the others.  Exterior styling - esp taillights is very cool.  More masc than Q5.  Nav system was a little annoying at first, but now I'm used to it and it works great.  Most comfortable seats on the road.  "

First, the vehicle has been super dependable and second, it is fun to drive.  The only negative (other than the navigation system) is rear passenger  space but for two people and some gear I can't think of a better small suv.   The acceleration and braking are excellent.  I generally sell my cars at 100K or so but this one is a keeper and I see no reason to but a newer XC60 (or comparable suv) since the style and performance are virtually unchanged.  I tested the BMW and Audi small suv's before buying the XC60 and the reason I picked the Volvo was the comfort of the seat - I didn't even need to test drive the others as the Volvo fit me so much better it would have been a huge compromise in seating comfort.  I'm 6'2"" and my wife 5'3"" and we both agree the front seats are excellent.  My longest drive was 18 continues hours and no ""sore"" spots.

Took it to the dealership and they duplicated the problem but Volvo didn't authorize repair, called it normal operation. Have had multiple e-mail exchanges with Volvo customer service and there response has been, its an ""information system"" and not a ""safety system"", it will give off ""false indications"" under certain driving conditions, which must be most of my driving conditions since its always coming on.

I have a 'whirling' sound that becomes louder with increased speed.  Dealer says it's the tire tread and is expected.

Could be the most beautiful interior of any car/any make. It is gorgeous inside. Same engine as my last '08 XC90 but peppier, sportier. Really fun to drive. Test drove the redesigned V6 Subaru Outback (GREAT drive)that surprised me; MB GLK (pointless joke of a back seat); VW Tiguan (just for fun); and considered Audi Q5 but not seriously(too expensive/smaller.) Driving the XC60 is a blast. Feel is refined, tight with a first-rate finish. Two tone leather seats and blond wood are stunning. Hard to leave the Volvo brand.

I can't beliee Ford let Volvo go.  I don't understand how other owners use their cars, but we get 19 in town on 29 on the highway at 75 mph.  Ours has everything except blind spot warning.  The car has 9 inches of ground clearance that is 3 inches more than Mercedes and Audi.  Bluetooth should autosync with which ever phone ins in range, not just the first one on the pair list.  Driver #2 always has to manually sync, even when in the car alone.  Dealer had us test the City Safety before we left the lot. Good idea as it would scare you if it was actually used."
volvo,xc60,2010,Dan, 10/23/2010,Nice ride in the Rocky Mountains,4,"This is the second Volvo and this one is the best. It has so many great features and is fun to drive. City Safety was tested on my car at the dealer, boy did it work as designed. Very comfortable seats front and back. lot more good cargo room compared to Infinity and the electronic features are easy to work. Bluetooth is clear as a land line and auto-sync when I get into the car. The safety features of the car really impressed me and i really feel safe. Very quiet ride, almost as quiet as the Lexus with little outside noise.  Good ground clearance better by 3"" over my Acura MDX and much better handling and tighter feel on the road.  I really enjoy driving it.  Very happy."
volvo,xc60,2010,R Driver, 03/30/2010,Great package for sporty ride,4,"It's tight and very comfortable.  You can feel the road much better compared to the non-R, but don't expect a Porsche.  This is still a cross over.  So why pay extra for the R?  Besides the design elements that are obvious, its all about the drive.  This is a great car for the driver who wants to feel the road, have less body roll and tighter steering.  For the passengers, they may find it a bit rigid off the highway, so if your passenger has influence over the purchase, bring them for the test drive. Your also going to have to be more careful with those 20"" rims - and tires will be more expensive. If you drive a T6 and think its the same as the R.  Think again.  Drive it and decide."
volvo,xc60,2010,CT Driver, 05/07/2010,Try it and you will buy it !!,4,"I was in a automobile accident and got a settlement that allowed me to get anything I wanted, For the first and last time in my life,price really wasn't an obstacle. I wanted a comfortable vehicle that had easy entry and exit and one that I felt safe in . The Mercedes E-class was ""underwhelming"",not nearly worth the money (I had owned a 1962 220 SB that felt like it was carved from a  ingot of iron,new one, no way).The  Audi Q5 was real nice,but the MMI controls and requirement for high test gas  were a turn off.Cadillac,Lincoln,Lexus(salesman wouldn't even come over),Ditto for Infiniti. Plus they just didn't feel right.Test drove the XC60 and -wow. I had found my car."
volvo,xc60,2010,Rob, 09/12/2010,I love my XC 60,4,"I was in love with the Volvo XC 60 since I first saw it at a secret test shoot in Reno a few years ago.  From that moment, I wanted one (and I already owned the Volvo XC 90).  I finally bought it a few months and and I absolutely love it.  If I have any complaints---they are:  1. Gas Mileage is subpar (the car REALLY gets about 14 MPG in the city, and 21ish on the highway (and I have the smallest engine).  2.  There's a bad blind spot looking out the back window.  Other than that's, it's fantastic. And...don't buy their navigation system (I didn't).  Buy a Garmin NUVI 3790(which is better)and have your autosound dealer install it and save $$. Other than that, I love this car and so will you"
volvo,xc60,2010,millie, 10/07/2010,Happy customer,4,"After driving many competitors in the smaller-SUV ""luxury"" market, was enticed by XC60s size, styling, warranty and maintenance program. For a medium sized SUV I find the trunk space to be adequate (MUCH better than the Audi Q5).  Have the Turbo and it is a zippy awesome driving experience.  It is a comfortable, lovely ride.  Controls are easy to use/operate.  Complaints (minor) are no change holder in center console.  Wind whistles through the sunroof area when you go above 40mph (need to get that checked out).  The tan interior is lighter than I expected so bought stain protection out of fea--it is doing its job.  "
volvo,xc60,2010,SAM, 08/03/2016,This is not a fake review,5,"I can not find anything wrong with this design and  comfort  as well as  safety   XC 60  2010  AWD    Highly  recommend this  SUV   total luxury  and it  is real fast .  The AWD is a  dream.  15000 miles on her since I bought her  and  she is still  drives  like a champ .  Just keep the oil  changed ,  best part this SUV  does not have a timing  belt or  chain  so no need to  have to  replace that .  All I have had to  do was change the oil  a few times ,  I put a new cabin filter in  and air filter . They don't make them like this anymore  a strong  V 6  with decent gas mileage  and very  well made .
"
volvo,xc60,2010,Shari, 04/27/2017,Still in love,5,"This car is a dream to drive; cabin well designed, and seats are ultra comfortable. I hope this car lasts forever, or at least as long as I do. Who needs a new car --this Volvo is perfect.
"
volvo,xc60,2010,Max, 05/19/2009,Great so far,4,"I am completely happy with the xc60 so far.  Both the exterior and interior styling are great and the ride quality is nice.  I have encountered a few minor quirks which I hope will fix themselves (the doors didn't lock once when I started moving, the optional collision warning sounded once when there was no one near me, and  a little piece of plastic fell off the tailgate that I simply had to pop back on).  Other than those very minor problems, I love the car and am completely happy with the purchase. "
volvo,xc60,2010,EX-Volvo, 06/11/2009,Constantly in the shop,3,"I've ""owned"" my XC60 for 1 month - half the time its been in the shop.  Dealership tells me they're ""working on it"" - at this point, I've been paying my lease for a car that I cannot drive.  Worst part of this experience - little remorse expressed by dealership, no attempt to take the car back.  Dealership tells me that its up to corporate which I found out was a lie (according to corporate).  Don't buy this car.  Very questionable business practices.  Embarrassingly poor customer service   "
volvo,xc60,2010,mhollowell, 08/04/2009,XC60 became inoperable 2 wks post purch.,3,"I'm in the same boat as EX-Volvo (reviewed 6/11/09). I drove my XC60 for two weeks when it broke down, showing a transmission problem. Today makes 8 days since it broke, and I still do not have my car back (nor do I want it back, really). I've been passed from the dealership to corporate and back a handful of times and am still waiting on some resolution. Volvo says that the valve body needs to be replaced and that my car is not the first that has had this same issue. Make sure to ask about this before you purchase."
volvo,xc60,2010,Mary L., 12/21/2009,Wipers are a saftey hazard,3,"The vehicle handles well in all types of weather.  However, side mirror defrosters would be a great addition since they are standard on other vehicles.  Besides the poor navigation system and poor night time back up camera visibility, my main complaint is the poor design for the windshield wipers.  For a such a safety conscious company, Volvo blew it in this area. These are a safety hazard. Snow & ice build up quickly despite a defrost temp of 85 degrees, requiring frequent stops in inclement weather and traffic to clear!  The large swath not covered by the wipers in upper right windshield, is also a safety hazard due to the poor visibility this creates.  "
volvo,xc60,2010,Halllucy, 03/25/2010,Good Riding XC60,4,"This is my third Volvo.  I like the old Volvo ""Box Style"" and did not like any of the new Volvo ""hatch-back"" looking cars, so I bought the XC60 Crossover.  However before the test drive, I was a bit hesitant because I don't like driving and looking down at other drivers.  The test drive proved this was not an issue.  I love my XC60.  The only problems is the low gas mileage and AM radio reception.   "
volvo,xc60,2010,KW, 03/30/2010,Great SUV,4,"Have had my XC60 for 5 months and so far this SUV has been great. It feels very solid on the road with just the right amount of feedback. The seats are the best in the auto industry as I can drive for hours and not feel fatigued. There is enough space for four adults and plenty of gear while not feeling to large like the XC90. The gas mileage is fair, I've been getting 18 MPG on average. City Safety works great, a car in front of me stalled at a green light, I went, got to close and the car stopped itself...saved me from an accident. Great looks inside and out, especially at night with the LED lights. Really enjoy driving this car as my daily commuter."
volvo,xc60,2010,Brian in Colorado, 04/13/2010,Great for the mountains,4,"I have owned my 2010 XC60 for just over a year; it was one of the first delivered in Colorado. With the T6 it has plenty of power and great winter handling. Easily and safely gets to the ski resorts in the winter. Actually fun to drive on snowy roads! Gas mileage leaves something to be desired, as it averages only about 19 mpg. My terra cotta bronze model with the exterior/interior appearance packages and two-tone interior styling looks great, too."
volvo,xc60,2010,VOLVO XC60 3.2 AWD, 06/04/2010,"Fun, Safe, and Enjoyable",4,"Overall, this car is fantastic.  It is fun to drive.  It handles more like a car than an SUV.  Tight turning radius.  The city safety feature as standard demonstrates Volvo's dedication to safety.  The ride is smooth and handles well on the road in all conditions.  The only problem is the gas mileage.  Fuel economy is great on long open roads (at times I was getting in near 30 mpg), while city driving I get close to 10.  This disparity is my only problem with the vehicle.  I had an idea of this going in, which is why I am happy with my selection.  Volvo did great with this car."
volvo,xc60,2010,Don , 06/23/2010,Tire Problem,4,"This is our third Volvo and the best.  Ordered this car on the overseas delivery program in May 09;accepted it in Sweden in June and picked up at our local dealer in July 09.  We currently have 18,000 miles of enjoyable and safe driving with this car.  We've had some minor problems with the BLIS; replaced the unit and reloaded the software a couple of times. Problem remain with a lot of driver side 'false' warnings.  -TIRES- came with the Pirelli Scorpion Zero Asimmetrico 235/60R18 tires.  After the 15,000 mile service I noticed a rapidly increasing tire noise.  Took it to the dealer who did an alignment (not out much). Severe wearing and cupping on the inside.  Volvo denies problem exists."
volvo,xc60,2010,Hz2bred, 07/16/2010,Volvo XC60,2,"After 3 days of driving our new XC60; the power steering went out. It took the dealership over 1 week to fix the problem and get the part.  This model has been recalled 2 times since our purchase. In less than one year: a piece of the sunroof fell off and the rear wiper blade motor burned out. This has been a bit of a disappointing driving experience; especially when we spent over $40,000.00 on a car. "
volvo,xc60,2010,JessH.CO, 07/19/2010,First of many Volvos,4,"We bought our XC60 a few weeks ago and WE LOVE IT!  We researched nearly every midsize SUV in the market (Acura RDX, VW, Nissan, Infiniti, Subaru, Jeep, Honda, GMC, Mazda, Lincoln, Lexus, Audi, Mercedes) and we always kept comparing them to the Volvo XC60.  We love everything about this car!  We went with the T6 w. climate, premium, & convenience packages.  We love the power and responsiveness of the T6. Other SUVs we looked at had an annoying turbo lag.  The fuel economy isn't fantastic but we knew that going in and it hasn't disappointed.  On a long road trip we average 22 MPG.  This is our first Volvo and I know that it wont be our last! "
volvo,xc60,2010,JrDriver, 07/26/2010,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"I had no idea Volvo made such a cool car.  This one drives great.  Good pickup, excellent handling.  I would say it took me a thousand miles to feel this way about it, but I am really impressed.  Even better, I bought it because it was super comfortable inside with excellent cargo space and those factors have not disappointed.  We looked at a lot of cars and are thrilled that we bought the right one."
volvo,xc60,2010,linette, 07/21/2010,Love love love,4,"This is my 4th Volvo and the best yet. Purchased over a year ago and it has performed substantially better than any previous Volvo models I've owned. Volvo's safety reputation is what keeps me coming back and the XC60 is no exception. I constantly get compliments on what a nice looking vehicle it is. Has perfect blend of cargo space, but does not look or feel like a full scale SUV (that's good in my opinion!). Only downside is the gas mileage. I am spending a lot of quality time at gas stations! I would still buy another one in a heartbeat."
volvo,xc60,2010,ELISEO, 09/06/2010,LOVE AND AMAZING FOR THE MONEY,5,"Beautiful interior, extremely fun to drive, perform excellent & better that MB, Audi, & VW (I tested & drie all). Safe for all, including the kids. Seats excellent can not be better. I have respiratory problems and the air inside is soo clean for the new air system is amazing. Friend this car is amazing."
volvo,xc60,2010,Karen, 08/27/2020,Almost perfect AWD,5,"I bought my 2010 XC60, brand new and fresh from Sweden. More than ten years later with 99,000 miles I believe I could drive it many more years. I have always maintained it at factory approved dealers, besides tire and brakes my car has needed very little. I will say the downside to driving this car are the digital notifications. The worst has been “low oil Stop now”. It is getting to be a more common issue with this car. Very Safe, love Volvos’s!"
volvo,xc60,2010,Kris, 08/10/2015,Don't buy this Chinese-Owned Vehicle.,3,"I'm writing this to encourage you to find other options than Volvo.  [non-permissible content removed]  I feel it necessary to write a review that people will read-in the 2015 section.  I owned a 2010 T6 AWD AND paid for the Polestar Upgrade (+30 HP).  Fact is, I really liked the seats in the car and driving it was fun, except when it broke!  At 55K miles, I paid for a new wheel hub ($650), at 60K miles, a rear stab link broke off ($450), then the doozie-at 65K miles the Rear Differential AND Active On Demand Coupler went bad (over $6500) !  NO THANK YOU!!! I promptly traded my vehicle in for an American Made Chevrolet Traverse and never looked back!  Volvo claims to be a Premium Brand-Not Yet, My Friends, Not Yet !  Honestly, you will LOVE this vehicle until it's time to get it fixed.

What I lose:
Comfy Seats, Acceleration, Smaller Car Handling, Adaptive Cruise Control, Blind Spot Indicators
What I gain:
Keep more of my $$$, On Star is way underrated for safety/security, Way more Cargo/Passenger Space, American Pride, More USB Ports, Better Chevy Customer Service
What is Similar:
Exact Same Safety Ratings

volvo,xc60,2010,Brenda Beavers , 12/12/2019,My first Volvo,3,"Ive owned a lot of vehicles and have had two Mercedes and decided to give Volvo a try since i worked for North America Volvo Tractors in NRV so I  bought a 2010 Volvo XC60 T6 Turbo i did buy 2nd handed and I  bought it From Tabatha Champ in Charlotte NC so no inspection sticker so bring it to Va had to get inspected bought in January 2019 had to have 2 motor mounts put on antifreeze had to be changed, have to now have oxygen sensor put in front head light need to be replaced has moisture in headlights, and when the temperatures are freezing my doors freeze up and i cant get in it, and the interior is not the greatest value, im very dispointed in my volvo they need to check out these models mine isnt that old i just sold a 99 Mercedes ml 350 nothing wrong with it that had great performance and no broken motor mounts , nothing....

volvo,xc60,2010,XC, 05/08/2010,BLIS and More,3,"Six trips to repair BLIS - the last to have new software downloaded and was told it was fixed.  It was on in my driveway...it was on in an empty parking lot while I was in Park.  Still not fixed.  Just had the rack and pinion steering replaced.  Did I mention the car has less than 10,000 miles on it, is 4 months old and I bought it with 4500 dealer miles on it?  Volvo just offered me a new replacement vehicle, but I want out completely and have lemon law arbitration in about a week. The vehicle is a bust and so is the dealership."
volvo,xc60,2010,geckoxv, 12/24/2010,Still loving it!,4,"I believe I researched, test drove and compared every SUV on the market.
I eventually decided on the Volvo XC60.
The Volvo brand has always meant quality and safety.
However, when looking at BMW X5, Lexus or Mercedes the same things can be said.
The decision was made when I test drove and the $$ was discussed.
The test drive blew me away.
I felt that the XC60 was everything I was looking for and more."
volvo,xc60,2010,Cheoto, 06/27/2010,Excelent for the money. FWD,5,"I have this car for a month and cannot be better, excellent quality inside and outside. Nice ride and easy to drive and the security features are amazing, better than q5 and X3 (far away)"
volvo,xc60,2010,Happy owner, 03/10/2017,Love My XC90,5,"First let me say up front that my Volvo is not 2010.  It was the youngest option and I chose it so I could share my experience owning my XC90.  I purchased my Volvo 2006 XC90 new from the dealer.  It was on the expensive side but having owned 2 used volvos prior I felt comfortable with this purchase.  So, the reason for my post is to let others interested in purchasing older XC90's would know a little about them.  I have had a wonderful experience owning mine.  It is currently 11 years old but it aged very well and looks as current as newer models.  I have 3 sons so comfort mattered.  The vehicle has adiquitly accommodated that must manyntimes on long trips.  Realibality was a absolute!  I got that also.  Not sure if my experience is unusual or not but I've noticed many other owners of the same have had not so go comments about owning theirs.  However, I only have a couple of issues to be noted.  First, I did have to replace the Turbo at about 80k.  This was the largest repair expense I've had as of yet.  Also, I learned that when this Volvo recommends the oil change frequency, it means it.  Had I paid attention to my oil changes, it would of saved my turbo and I most likely wouldn't of had to replace it.  Oil change as recommended a must!  Second:  at about 110k my Volvo started sputtering, acting hesitant at take off and it had even did on me a few times.  Problem solved very quickly and didn't cost that much.  It was my coils.  This is regular wear and replace.  Done.  Now for the features.  I have one complaint...  I do hate the headlight covers.  They are so fogged up and there is no way for them to be cleaned.  Hate them.  Volvo should have made these out of glass and not plastic.  Also, the seat adjusting systems.  Both of mine have broken and I've had to replace twice.  Just a bad designe.  Utility box in middle front seats slips from connection and lid busted at hinge.  Not so bad.  Front cup holders are not removeable so they stay dirty unless your willing to pry them out and break them.  Sirously though,  wonderful car for my family and I truly would recommend.  So sad to see that this auto didn't hold a higher value at resale.  It is really worth a lot more.  One happy Volvo owner!
"
volvo,xc60,2010,Michael Brown, 04/26/2009,Volvo Headed Back to Greatness,4,"As the past owner of 3 Volvo, I can tell you that I switched brands because my last Volvo was a disappointment. After lots of nudging, my wife convinced me to look to Volvo as a replacement vehicle for her wonderful BMW 530i which had come to  the end of its lease. We need an SUV type vehicle and the X3 was not satisfactory and the X5 was too big. The XC60 was perfect. It drives incredibly well (a smidge better then the Audi Q5). It has buckets of power and torque and stops well. Coming over a twisty hill at a good clip with an unexpected major drop, my wife was able to control the vehicle easily and there was no loss of grip or direction. That one maneuver closed the deal for us!!"
volvo,xc60,2010,coachrick, 04/19/2009,3 weeks and counting...,4,"We are about three weeks and 600 miles into enjoying our new XC 60. We traded an 07 XC 70 so some comparisons may be in order.    This vehicle has a much smoother power band than the XC 70 had...VERY powerful at low RPM and very smooth and quiet.  Ride is very tight and smooth, not cushy but actually similar to our '08 C 70...fairly tight cornering, some feedback from dips and rises in the roadway.  Haven't been over 80 yet but freeway speeds are effortless. Even somewhat loaded, this wagon has plenty of low-end grunt.  The wagon we traded was plenty capable...the XC 60 is all that...and more refined. The bells and whistles... Nav, Blis, City Safety, etc deserve their own review--to follow."
volvo,xc60,2010,Jerry W, 05/04/2009,Volvo Bravo!!,4,"Had it for a week.  A blast to drive - nicely weighted steering, peppy acceleration, and firm (but not harsh) ride over horrible pothole-filled roads in Michigan. Sandstone beige interior and dual tone dash convey luxury feel to it. Panoramic sunroof is magnificent (a free upgrade too).  Unique City Safety (although haven't got the guts to test it yet) and long list of Volvo's safety features are all good.  Very satisfied with the purchase!!"
volvo,xc60,2010,MaxLoad, 05/11/2009,Impressed so far . . .,4,"It's only been a couple of days since I took ownership of the XC60, but I'm extremely satisfied so far.  The car has good pick-up, a nice ride, and pretty decent handling.  The biggest drawback so far is the navigation system."
volvo,xc60,2010,bg, 05/23/2009,Hopefully Brighter Future,4,"We have this as a replacement for an RDX. The ride in that was so harsh that it was almost unbearable. This has been the polar opposite. Though the power steering pump was gone after 17 miles (!) the vehicle has a feeling of high quality. I also ran into great difficulties after having ordered a loaded-sans BLIS car, and realizing that every website known to man had incorrectly labeled power-folding mirrors as standard (I need them for my garage), which is not the case. I went to the dealer who went to the ends of the earth to try to change my order, but it couldn't be done. The dealer found another one with BLIS which we got, though it didn't have nav. I believe Volvo has changed their site"
volvo,xc60,2010,Deborah Gura, 05/29/2009,2010 XC60,4,The 2010 Volvo XC 60 is a fabulous SUV -  I am very satisified with my purchase. It is fun to drive - the turbo engine accelerates nicely. It has a stylish exterior and interior.  Very comfortable seats.  I purchased with the BLIS - blind spot system  - I don't know how I lived without this feature on previous cars. Extremely comfortable seats - plenty of leg room and the panoramic moon roof is tinted so it allows light without making the car too hot.
volvo,xc60,2010,pblax8, 06/04/2009,Great Family/Fun Car,4,"I've owned volvos most of my life and this is by far the most stylish inside and out.  The handling and engine responsiveness are outstanding for a 4200lb vehicle and far better than the BMW X3 or Mercedes GLK which I also considered purchasing. I have 4 kids and wanted the safest car possible w/o buying a tank.  Volvo claims its the safest car they've made, that says a lot by itself as Volvos are known as very safe cars."
volvo,xc60,2010,Steve R, 06/14/2009,Near Perfect For What It Is,4,"It was a close, but the XC60 got me. The X3 is too dated. The GLK's back seat is too cramped for adults-if human. The RX350 has just about everything. Except inspiration. Life is too short to live like that. So it came down to the Q5 and XC60. The face, rear, skin, and interior chest of the Q still make me wonder if I picked the right mate. But its brains came out of the shop as iDrive, and the plastics used made me feel like its beauty may be skin deep. The Swede caught my eye too, though in a different language. She wrapped her 2-tone arms around me. Had a firm, smooth ride. Stirred me with her strength and agility. And made me feel like she'd carry my child in safety. She's the one."
volvo,xc60,2010,Alex, 06/16/2009,Awsome Crossover Kudos Volvo,4,"I purchased this XC 60 to replace a gas hog truck. It has been awsome to drive, I am really impressed with the craftsmanship by Volvo."
volvo,xc60,2010,1stTimeOwner, 07/06/2009,First Month,4,"We are staring a family and purchased the XC60 because we wanted a SUV that was safe, reliable, and professional looking. We considered several SUVs including the X5/X3, Tiguan, and XC90. The XC90, XC60, and X5 were the finalists. We choose the XC60 because of its size and agility, styling, and uniqueness.  Reliability is a concern and we have noticed some minor build defects. Fuel economy is lower than expected (14mpg), and the rear seat barely accommodates our child seat. Wind noise at high speeds is louder than expected.  Driving the XC60 is pleasurable and we are satisfied with our purchase overall. We have received compliments from other drivers and envious stares from XC90 owners."
volvo,xc60,2010,Bob, 06/30/2009,This Is The SUV For You,5,"The XC 60 is by far the best car I have driven and/or owned in my 40 years of driving.  I did a great deal of research on it prior to its release date and it has exceeded my expectations.  I traded in a fully loaded Highlander for this car and I am glad I did.  It is a much better vehicle than the Highlander, which I liked.  The XC 60 drives and handles very well; extremely powerful on the highway."
volvo,xc60,2010,nhdriver, 08/02/2009,Great Car,4,"Took overseas delivery option and drove the car 800 miles in 5 days all over Sweden.  We averaged 22 miles per gal. driving on highways, backroads, and city.  The ride was smooth and very comfortable. The BLIS feature and the distance sensoring cruise control were great for unfamiliar roads and drivers. Love the push button lock and folding side view mirrors.  The navigation control takes some getting used to, but it worked great in taking us around road construction in real time.  Can't wait for it to be delivered state side."
volvo,xc60,2010,Jerry W, 08/25/2009,Volvo Bravo 2,5,"This is an update of my previous review in May 2009.  I've had the vehicle for 4 months and over 4,000 miles now. Although the observed fuel economy started out low (18-19 mpg), it has since improved to 20-21 mpg in a mix of highway and city driving, using regular grade gasoline.  For an AWD vehicle, this is actually quite good! In this review, I have given the fuel economy a 9 (previously given an 8)."
volvo,xc60,2010,Elmo, 09/09/2009,"One Month In, Love It",4,"Have had my T6 XC60 for a month now and absolutely love it.  Traded up from a T5 XC70 and it is night and day different in terms of comfort, performance, gadgets and head turn.  Even my wife loves it and she's pretty neutral about cars.  The XC60 is more roomy for front and rear seat passengers, has a much more comfortable ride, and the T6 is a lot of fun.  Even the handling is good for a ""crossover"" vehicle.  Not top heavy and mushy like some other higher ends we drove.  Knock wood, none of the initial build quality issues noted here (yet) in fact, no issues at all to date.  We are very excited about it and love out new XC60. "
volvo,xc60,2010,xcreddy, 10/04/2009,Overall Happy,4,"Have driven for a week. Overall happy with the purchase. 32,900 w/ metallic paint and premium package/sunroof. Smooth ride, quiet. Could use a few more hps as tranny has to shift often. Design is nice. Interior is luxurious though there are a few shortcuts (cheap plastic interior door pull) "
volvo,xc60,2010,uncleo, 10/04/2009,Factory pickup,4,"We just returned from picking up our XC60 at the factory. What a wonderful experience. We were treated royally and toured the factory. We then took the Volvo and drove in Scandinavia. We drove super-highways, cities, narrow mountain roads, rough roads and smooth ones. The XC60 performed superbly! The safety systems are wonderful. The handling on winding roads is stable and comfortable. The car is quiet and responsive. We drove in snow flurries without any problem. Of course, at nearly $10 per gallon for gasoline a bit more economy would be nice. We anxiously await the stateside delivery."
volvo,xc60,2010,Tahoe, 10/08/2009,"Seriously, Not bad at all",4,"My wife and I bought this car last week and we love it.  It handles like a dream and so far the mileage is greater then we expected.  23.5 as of this morning.  We are both over 6 feet tall, I'm 6'4"" and she is 6'2"" and fit very comfortably.  However, the back seat isn't going to much use unless you are under about 5'5"".  There is a ton of cargo room and the car is almost as fun to drive as our mini cooper.  When on cruise control, this car climbs like a mountain goat.  There is no hesitation or effort put forth by the engine and the turbo WILL put you back in your seat."
volvo,xc60,2010,Volvo loyalist, 10/12/2009,It's all good (but the rear view mirror),4,I purchased the XC60 to replace a 2002 Volvo S60.  It took me no time to get used to a crossover.  I get a lot of compliments on its unique looks and the build quality seems very high end .  The attention to detail is excellent - e.g. double stitched leather.  Overall I am very happy with the XC60.
volvo,xc60,2010,Nancy, 10/28/2009,Not all that great!,4,Try parallel parking at night when there is no outdoor lighting and it might change your mind about your purchase of this model without buying the Bliss feature.  Tinted and extra small rear windows make it hard to see at night.  Volvo does not make an adequate dog gate for this model and the one you may have from your wagon will not fit.
volvo,xc60,2010,Anand, 11/07/2009,XC 60 3.2 AWD/Premium + Climate Package,4,"AThis car replaced a 2004 V70 2.5T. The XC60 has about the same interior space as my V70 with easier step in height and better ground clearance. The ride is smooth with less NVH than the V70 and the transmission shifts without hesitation. However, acceleration is a little sluggish compared to the 2.5T engine and fuel economy is significantly worse at 22-24 on the highway. Front seats are extremely comfortable but the back seat is cramped. Fit and finish is very good with no squeaks or rattles. Rear visibility is quite good and the headlights are strong. My car is equipped with BLIS which works reasonably well. Overall, My XC60 is a very comfortable,all weather car with mediocre fuel economy."
volvo,xc60,2010,Jay Kim, 11/08/2009,Best value for luxury CUV,4,"I got a T6 model with comfort, climate and technology package and we love it. Before the purchase, my wife and I thoroughly researched and test drove other competitors. At the end, my we narrowed our choice down to RX, Q5 and XC60. We liked Q5 the best in terms of driving dynamic, followed by XC60 and dreadful RX, but Volvo won us over in interior/exterior design, utility and value. RX had great interior, technology features and excellent fit and finish, but totally uninspired exterior design and driving characteristics. Our biggest concern for getting a Volvo was reliability issue, but we got convinced by Volvo's safe and sound program that provides 5 years of warranty and free maintenance."
volvo,xc60,2010,Chris & Sheria, 11/05/2009,Great Choice -,4,"My wife and I did extensive research and test drives.  Lexus, BMW, Audi and Volvo XC60 and XC90.  The Audi was the best driving, but the Volvo won in every other category.  The features, ownership cost, performance and overall experience the Volvo XC60 won hands down.  We were very impressed with the interior layout and the heated rear seats were a nice feature.   We didn't notice very much difference in performance between the 3.2L and the 3.0L Turbo, so we opted for the 3.2L  The Gas mileage to date is averaging 21 mpg, and that is with a about a 70% city and 30% highway driving.  We are going on our 3rd week of ownership, and so far no issues.  "
volvo,xc60,2010,NeoVolvoLoyalist, 11/05/2009,All Good Thus Far,4,"My wife and I have had this vehicle for about a month now, and we have been thoroughly satisfied. I have been a VW fanatic since birth, and this is my first car (I bought a Ford Truck about 4 years ago) purchase outside of VW in my life. I was immediately impressed with the handling of the car for such a large vehicle. Additionally, we have been impressed with the sheer volume of the vehicle as we moved up from a VW Jetta. I am also very impressed with the maintenance plan of 60000 miles. Overall this is perhaps one of the best purchases I've ever made. I would highly recommend it, its at least worth a look. "
volvo,xc60,2010,lin, 11/19/2009,new car,4,"like the xc60, but seats not a comfortable as my former s60.  Also, when I go from park to drive, something knocks under the car. Found out after I took delivery that Volvo is mistakenly leaving off parts that are supposed to be standard equipment on the T6 and 3.2...make sure yours has the polished exhaust tips before you sign any papers. My didn't (how often do you check a car to see if it has all the standard equipment it is supposed to) (do we need to lift the hood and make sure everything is there before we drive it off the lot?) volvo has been slow to get these parts on my new car. The company should issue a recall to have these put on the cars like they were supposed to. "

Online customer and editor reviews are everywhere - edmunds, kbb, others.  Everyone complains about the poor gas mileage and nav, so you should know this going in. I've had my T6 for 3 weeks now and absolutely love it.  I got climate & convenience packages, power roof.  It's smooth, quiet, corners very well, quick off the line and passing on the highway. Size is perfect to throw the dog in back or load up on Costco runs.  Now I know why it was named Truck of the Year at the LA Auto Show."

Not to bed on the highways (24-25mpg), absolutely poor in the city - never more then 12mpg, same super and regular gasoline. Comparing to Passat 2.0 - 25mpg in the city, 35mpg on the highways. "
volvo,xc60,2010,teejay, 01/02/2010,Really Cool Volvo,5,"We traded our 12-year old S70 for the XC60 3.2L. We test drove several other crossover SUVs but none felt as well built, safe, comfortable, or luxurious as the XC60. This is our 5th Volvo. The S70 had no squeaks or strange noises and still looked great.  We selected the Premier and Convenience packages. This car comes with all the other features that we wanted. The ride is smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  The cargo area is roomy. When you set the power seat, it includes the side-view mirror settings as well. We chose the slate interior, which is really good looking with the brushed aluminum trim. We purchased the Environmental Protection package. Will not need wax for 7 years. Cool vehicle!"
volvo,xc60,2010,Ed Knodle, 01/06/2010,XC 60 is a First Class Vehicle,4,"Our purchase of the xc60 was after 6 months of research and evaluation on practically every SUV from all manufacturers.  This is our fourth Volvo in the past 20 years and we can say that the thought and attention to detail that goes into a Volvo is top notch.  We traded in our ten year old S80 T6 for this car and the XC60 outshines the S80 in every respect, comfort, fit and finish, performance, and yes the mpg is comparable.  MPG is a weakness but not disqualifying when compared to similar engine and drivetrain configurations.  The 3.2 version improves the mpg but at the expense of power. In summary Volvo has come up with a winner."
volvo,xc60,2010,vmerch, 01/05/2010,Mixed Review,3,"I added the optional Nuvi/Volvo navigation unit when I purchased the car. It looks great in the recessed dash space, but the dealership dented the center stack when installing. After getting the car back, I have had continued rattles in the back. I removed every possible part that could cause the noise and it still exists. Yesterday the BLIS on the passenger side stopped working. I cleaned the lense but it still blinks on/off and most of the time just stays on. It will be in the shop again this Friday. For 6 weeks of ownership it will have been out of service for 2. While I drove both the MB350 GLK and this car, I am beginning to regret my Volvo choice. "

I was not sure about the navigation system on the car based on reviews, but I was happily surprised on the way it works, I actually think that the controls are better position on the steering wheel compared to a touch screen based navigation."
volvo,xc60,2010,Mark , 01/31/2010,Everything I thought it would be,4,"I have had my XC60 for two months now and it has performed better than I expected. I had a S60R and was concerned I would miss the performance. While the T6 isn't the same as my R it is better than I expected it to be. The fuel economy is a little less than the S60R and could be better. There hasn't been one thing I would say was a disappointment,"

The gas mileage is not great but lets face it this is an SUV/crossover and I am pretty happy with the 18mpg I am getting in city driving (my S60 got only 21).  Love the design interior and exterior, seats are improved over S60 (which is saying a lot), all controls improved, love the panoramic moon roof.  Amazing vehicle!  Absolutely no problems or complaints!  Compared to other vehicles in the class the XC60 offeres the best value for the money by far... note even close to others. "

The fit and finish is very good, The sunroof is HUGE, the ride is perfect for a crossover SUV, and the optional AWD is not as intrusive as it was on the XC70. A nice feature is the fact that there are not many on the road, makes it feel exclusive. "
volvo,xc60,2010,loyaltim, 03/06/2010,Big improvement for R-design,5,"Just got XC60 R-Design in Passion Red, and did a test drive to compare R and ""normal"". I asked myself several times why I have to pay additional 3-4 thousand more just for the R logo and cosmetics features and I got an answer-  completely different handling (suspension and steering)and you can not compare it, even my wife notice that immediately- no body rolling and no sofa bed driving sense. Love it."
volvo,xc60,2010,Sara_J, 03/12/2010,First Volvo,4,"This is our first Volvo and so far, I couldn't be happier.  This is by far the most solid and comfortable car I've driven.  The seats are great, and the doors are bank vault heavy.  I got the climate, convenience, BLIS, premium, and booster seats.  So far, fuel economy has been just ok, but it's actually better than the G35 that I just turned in.  It goes without saying that my 3.2L version of the XC60 is not as fun to drive as the Infiniti sedan, but I haven't found it to be lacking in power.  I get lots of looks and questions; the car is just plain pretty and there aren't too many on the road just yet.  I drove just about every other crossover out there and think I made the right choice."

Exterior design is edgy, interior is rich, ride quality is smooth, and the vehicle just feels solid and safe to drive.  Sunroof is awesome.  Only real complaint is fuel economy. We would have preferred the turbo engine for a little more pep but did not want to sacrifice the gas mileage.  3.2 offers good power, though....not sluggish.  "

I've driven it through a typical New England winter and found it holds the road well, even in heavy winds.  I feel more confident and comfortable driving this vehicle than any other I've had.  Highway driving is fun, because the ride is smooth and comfortable.  "
volvo,xc60,2010,Kampaku, 04/02/2010,Get one before everyone else does!,4,"We live in a Chicago neighborhood, and we needed a car that could get us around in winter and fit in tight spaces, has enough cargo room to hold all the stuff that accompanies 2 young kids, and was enough fun to drive that my wife and I wouldn't mind hauling them around.  The XC60 met all of those requirements, plus it isn't ubiquitous like Lexus RXs, Acura MDXs, and BMW X5s!  There were a few features that I liked better in those cars and the Audi Q5, but we've been thrilled with the XC60 and would buy a 2nd one if had the the need & room."
volvo,xc60,2010,Midwest Alpinist, 03/28/2010,Love it...!,4,"I've had my XC60 for almost a year now and I LOVE everything about it, except for the fuel economy, which isn't bad for this class of car, but it's not great either.  What a pleasure it is to drive this car though! I took a couple of long road trips last summer (1000+ miles ea) and me and the passengers were all very comfortable. The car handles well, it looks awesome and it's loaded with everything you could want in a car.  Be sure to check out the overseas delivery program. I saved $2K on the price of the car (after I had already negotiated a disc with 2 separate dealers). They threw in 2 free RT plane tkts, a free hotel stay, + everything you need to drive legally in EU (plates/ins)"
volvo,xc60,2010,Long Islander, 04/02/2010,BLIS,4,"The BLIS has malfunctioned for most of the time I have had this car, with 4  service appointments - the most recent meat 2 weeks with out the car while they replaced more parts.  And...it still does not work!  Either flashing constantly, warnings on the dashboard, or constantly on.  Volvo is unapologetic, and not helping.  Pursuing Lemon Law at this point - a car that costs what this one does should work correctly and the BLIS on my car does not, after having quite a lot of work done on a new car. Having a small orange light flashing in my line of vision constantly is distracting and unacceptable, as is the loss of information on my dashboard"
volvo,xc60,2010,Kat, 04/08/2010,Love it,4,Love the car and very comfortable. It's a luxury car with a reasonable price tag. I have Japanese cars all my life and this is my first European car. And I love my decision. Its not too big or too small for a woman driver.

volvo,xc60,2010,Slobo Todorovic, 05/13/2010,Smooth operator,4,"Car (AWD 3.2L) rides extremely smoothly and feels great in city and highway driving. Even though Volvo is known for making comfortable cars, this model has probably best combination of suspension, tires and seats. It is extremely comfortable and quiet. Base engine has enough power and it is fun to drive in snow and in mountains. Base sound system and blue tooth are excellent. We did not get model with factory- installed navigation system but any aftermarket system can be nicely mounted on dash. We enjoy this car very much after owning it for 6 months (8 k miles)and would recommend it. It has nicer exterior lines than any other Volvo and is very comfortable for whole family.    "
volvo,xc60,2010,wmead3, 05/19/2010,Best Buy!,4,"Purchased our XC60 a month ago, and it's been great.  Driving is incredible, and comfort level is awesome.  I may have to buy another Volvo because my wife doesn't give me permission to drive this one much.  Great job Volvo!"
volvo,xc60,2010,Paul, 06/02/2010,XC60 T6 Review,4,"Compared; MB, BMW, Audi and Volvo. Owned MB, Lexus and Volvos (9th Volvo). Volvo best equipped for $$. Took delivery in Sweden.  Excellent trip. 2500 miles on odo and mpg is running; 20 city, 22.5 combo and 24 highway. Turbo tip: taking it easy on the pedal will return decent mpg. T6 engine is smooth and the 6 speed trans shifts extremely well. The best riding and handling Volvo, for me, and of course the seats should be used as a industry standard for comfort and function. Did not  purchase the nav system as Garmin is much easier to operate. I looked at the T6 R package but couldn't justify the extra $$ for what is included. The dealership calls to ensure I am happy.  Bullet proof so far."
volvo,xc60,2010,AP, 07/02/2010,Best luxury crossover for the price,5,"I absolutely love this car. I bought it for less than $33K with premium package and metallic paint, which is several thousand less than the closest contender, Audi Q5. I like its style and handling better. Interior may not look as flashy but is made of equal grade materials. Seats and ride are super comfortable. 3.2L engine provides plenty of power yet manages to give you 27 MPG on highway which is excellent in this class. The exterior styling is awesome, powerful and slightly aggressive, especially if you look from close distance. 5 year warranty and free maintenance are unbeatable, and you probably heard about the safety features. This is my first Volvo and I am thoroughly impressed!"
volvo,xc60,2010,eliseo.eugenin, 07/04/2010,May be the best in the segment,4,"Excellent quality and performance. However, please do not buy this car if you look for fuel economy is (19 or lower). Instead you get AMAZING quality, free maintenance for 5 years (compare prices with audi, MB or acura), fun to drive and a lot of safety features that are extremely fun a useful (even that in the beginning i complain that have to many lights and warnings), stability, room and a look of extra stuff like hicht, and other accessories, really fun."
volvo,xc60,2010,ayang90, 09/12/2010,No Regrets!,4,It was between the Audi Q5 and XC60 and I went for the XC60. Have about 3500 mi. on the car and I have no regrets with my decision. It's fun to drive and I haven't had any problems so far. Fits three kids comfortably in the back with the integrated booster and serves as an adequate backup family hauler when not using our mini-van. 
volvo,xc60,2010,JR, 09/30/2010,Volvo XC60 3.2 fwd,4,"Bought this to replace my Pilot, with the intent to get much better gas mileage and better features. Gas mileage is a little disappointing, 16 in town, 23 on trips. Better than the Pilot, but not that much. Engine overall is average. Interior, ride, handling (much better than Pilot, which is a boat), electronic features all excellent.  The main problem is that it's just a bit too small, miss the Pilot's space way more than I thought. Nice car but if I change my mind, I would. Ok for a small family, I guess. Beware of EPA estimates, they are a crock. No way this vehicle gets 27 highway if you go over 55.  You get run over in Calif. if you do less than 70."
volvo,xc60,2010,Dreamcruiser, 10/26/2020,Disappointed,2,"First European car after 3 Japanese cars - bought used in 2020 with 90,000 miles.  First issue - changing cabin filter requires partial disassembly of the console and pulling back the carpet.  Second issue - engine air filter container is soft plastic with self tapping screws.  Screw holes were stripped. Had to insert small zip ties in the holes to hold the screws to seal the air filter container.  Third issue - this model is one that had the faulty oil piston ring.  Burns over a quart of oil every 1,000 miles.  All three were design failures.  Last Volvo for me.

volvo,xc60,2011,newjersey2, 08/07/2011,Slick Ride with Great MPG,4,"Switched from Highlander and have been pleasantly surprised. Averaging 25 mpg in town and on highway by driving sensibly. Outstanding sound system with the NAV package. Not a whole lot of leg room in backseat, but front passenger seat folds down to tote large loads (10ft 2 bys). Not a super amount of off the line grunt, but cruises effortlessly at 80. Only complaint thus far is really dumb key start thingamajig. You can pull out the key and leave the car running inadvertantly, also you can leave accessories running without knowing it. Huh? What is Volvo thinking?"
volvo,xc60,2011,greatjohndini, 04/21/2011,Best car in my 30 years of driving!,5,I created an account just to review this car for anyone on the fence or evaluating cars in this class. I traded in my Infiniti EX35 for this car and I will never look back. Audi Q5 looked boring and audi/vw has a lot of issues. BMW X3 too small-image of driving a beemer:( And weird styling. Lexus.-comfortable but boring. Infinti.Was good but WAY too small and was not aging well after less than a year. And it felt -light?- VOLVO XC60. Totally solid car. I held back on it before because the audio/nav in the 09-10 was an absolute JOKE..but the 2011 version is great! Perfect! European. Safe. Best looking of the bunch. And 5/60 maintenance on everything but the tires! In love w/ driving again!
volvo,xc60,2011,brew_daddy_27, 02/01/2011,Buy It!,5,"I test drove and compared with the BMW X5, Audi Q5 and the Infiniti. Infiniti was tossed when I saw the size in person. Size matters! The only plus to the BMW was that I could add a third row of seating. The bad about both the BMW and the Audi was the price tag and what you get for that tag. The Volvo destroyed both in the safety department. I went with the T6 for the extra handling and body design. The curbside appeal of the T6 easily competes with the Audi (in my opinion wins). The end result is this, I have friend that purchased a loaded Q5 and another that purchased half loaded X5. Both are jealous of my loaded XC60. Not just the looks but the price tag was made them both weep."
volvo,xc60,2011,volvolove, 06/09/2011,best ever,5,"Having abandoned leasing I had done for many years and retiring, I decided to buy. Having looked at the Audi, BMW, and Volvo reviews for a fast SUV, I tried and then bought a Xc60.
It is the best car I have driven in 54 years.
Second was an Audi S4 I had
many years ago.
The Volvo handles almost as well-the Audi was
shorter and and lower,
a sports car in disguise.
But the Volvo handles so well in much greater
comfort (Is this a function of age?), and elegance and relative silence that I cannot imagine a better bargain. It comes near enough to the Audi in turning corners that I was amazed, given its weight and height. The interior defines simple elegance. Perfect for over 40s."
volvo,xc60,2011,missi4, 03/23/2013,Go for a long test drive,3,"After a week of driving the XC60, I noticed a problem with the transmission, a hesitation when accelerating from a complete stop/speeding up to pass etc. Like driving manual transmission in the wrong gear. Took it for service repetedly. Volvo wouldn't admit a problem and told me to use premium fuel. One mechanic said it's a 5000lb car you have to gun it (!!). Finally they said they knew what was wrong and to wait for a software update, that took 6 months. It helped but the problem was still there. Volvo went back to saying there was nothing wrong with the car. After a year, I had had it and asked how much they would give me for the car to end this, Carmax gave me more. The GPS stinks too. "
volvo,xc60,2011,mark, 11/09/2015,Beware the OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE,3,"Beware of the oil consumption issue. Bought a new 2011 xc60 turbo.  After a few years, noticed that i needed to add a quart of oil between 5000 mile oil changes.
didn't think much of it.  Only to learn, after it was beyond the warranty the oil needed to be added at more and more frequency.
After doing some research... ""simply google Volvo oil consumption"", then you begin to learn...

After complaining to Volvo, they offered to look at it.. after about $1500 in repairs, noting offering to change my oil trap (which i told them was already repaired and paid for), they said they did some necessary computer adjustments, and I must also purchase a new dipstick for the oil??? Didn't know why I would need a new dipstick??
After getting my next oil change 5000 miles later (happily with no new warnings of low oil level), my mechanic informed me that the car now takes 8 quarts of oil, instead of 7, and the new dipstick won't trigger the computer to state low oil level. 

WOW..... look elsewhere or do your research

volvo,xc60,2011,rkurlander, 03/22/2011,Satisfied Owner,4,"AWD, Premium, Sensus, Multimedia, Convenience, PCC. With 2,000 miles I give the Volvo XC60 an A-.
 Vehicle is very solid with excellent build quality.
Performance with the 3.2 engine is good. There is no reason to spend extra for the turbo unless the ""rush"" is important.
MPH is better than advertised with 20 city and 26.5 highway. Pirelli tires are excellent."
volvo,xc60,2011,Dave, 02/18/2016,Love this SUV / Crossover! Better than expected!,5,"I'd recommend this SUV to anyone looking for a nice vehicle (Family or not). I am a new father and needed a family car so the Mustang had to go. My wife wanted the Volvo for it's superior safety rating and I liked the looks. Turns out this vehicle handles almost as good as my Mustang! Not SUV like at all, as it has a nice suspension and very confident handling. Power is not bad at all with the 3.2L non-turbo engine as it likes to rev, can only imagine the turbo would be much more fun. I'm getting 21.5 mpg with all local driving and winter idling which was the most my V6 Mustang could make with mixed highway/city. The seats are very comfortable and the build is much better than the Ford I traded from. I'll keep you updated as I drive it. -well almost 2 years later and 20k miles on it. New tires, a few little scratches from the little guy and shopping carts and I still love it. So far only oil changes and a new battery is all it took. Everything else works great, better in snow than my pickup truck. Still looks sleek and modern even with the gorgeous new models from Volvo out. About the only flaw was the Volvo badge on the front flaked apart so I had to buy a new one from eBay.

volvo,xc60,2011,myob, 01/02/2011,A nice alternative to the snobmobiles,4,"Cross shopped with BMW X5 and considered others.
 The Volvo won because it combined good styling(inside and out), good handling for a crossover, great (prob the best in class) safety, a 5 year warranty with free service, and finally, a quality dealership experience that was close by. 
If you can swing it, I definitely recommend the T6 version with the 300hp, 325 lb torque turbo inline 6 engine.
It is buttery smooth, has no real turbo lag.Much better power delivery than a similar hp Infiniti engine, with a lot less vibration and noise.

We got the R design version for the tighter handling and steering, plus the design elements which make the car look better.
 It handles quite well."

Compared it to the latest Acura RDX, BMW X3, a few others. Great seats, handles great in the snow, lots of passenger and cargo space. Chose the naturally aspirated 6 and there's plenty of power without the turbo (tested both passing uphill on Rt. 280 near Livingston, NJ, those who have driven it can appreciate the statement). Love that it is a PZEV and AWD, and I expect better mileage sans turbo.

While all nice vehicles, I felt the Volvo had the best balance of performance, utility, and price.
And it simply projects more attitude than the Audi and BMW.

After 1500 miles, I have been very happy.
Acceleration and handling are great for a crossover, and the car feels so solid and secure when driving.
Also, interior comfort is top notch---I had heard good things about Volvo seats, and a recent 6 hour drive proved to me how comfortable the XC60 seats are."
volvo,xc60,2011,glennzwif, 02/27/2011,Best car I have ever owned,5,"Hands down this is the best car that I have ever owned. From the day I drove it off the lot, I haven't had one complaint (which is rare!). It hugs the road even in our snowy New Hampshire winter, has made it easily through the slippery mountains of Vermont when others couldn't, and last weekend we drove it to Quebec in a blizzard and it handled great. My husband is a pretty big guy (6'4"" and about 240) and he is extremely comfortable. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. "
volvo,xc60,2011,Robb, 06/07/2016,2011 Volvo SUV,5,"Best, most reliable vehicle I have ever owned.  I have been so impressed that I plan to get another.  Other than oil changes, new wipers and a new battery, it has required no service in the past 5 years.

volvo,xc60,2011,myob, 04/03/2011,Stealth performance and style,4,"This is our first ""crossover"".

After years of sport sedan driving we wanted more space for things and a higher driving position for traffic.
The engine is super smooth, it is quieter inside and smoother riding (even with R design) than previous Infiniti and BMW vehicles we've had.
 The interior looks great in two-tone leather, ergonomics are fine, and at the present it is rated the most reliable of the European brands.
 The 5 year warranty and free maintenance, including wear items(execept tires) is a plus.
Safety is unequaled.
 I am not thrilled with the lack of steering feel, but the vehicle will take fast corners and sticks to the roadexcellently.
Plenty of room for us."
volvo,xc60,2011,Volvo Xman, 12/03/2010,Great car for the money,4,"The Volvo XC60 is a great vehicle for anyone wanting to purchase in the ""realm"" of the luxury market. Although the price tag is easier to stomach than Mercedes, Audi, and BMW many of the luxury features you want are delivered, such as plush leather, bluetooth, premium ride. At 100mph the XC60 shows off its stability. ""Smooth ride"". There is plenty of cargo space, leg and head room, but the electronics such as Navigation system and radio display could be updated. Still a great car."

Used comparison tools to look at space, residual value, warranties, gas mileage, standard features, etc.
Save some $$ and get your own aftermarket NAV/DVD systems

Hope this helps somebody...don't think you can go wrong with this car!
Most luxurious I've ever owned and a pleasure to drive!
Virtually no road noise!"
volvo,xc60,2011,george167, 10/03/2011,Volvo got it right!,5,"My 4th volvo. This is the best yet. The R-design interior/exterior trim accentuate the beauty of this vehicle. The 20"" wheels are a surprise in handling and comfort. City safety, climate, nav, media, tech, and bliss packages w/satelite radio and remote keyless entry... all contribute to an excellent driving experience. 6 mos. /10,000+ miles to date and expect over 200k like my others.
Volvo has come of age with this model.
Solid, beautiful (R-design a must) and full of amenities. I can go on and on.
Perfect SoCal freeway vehicle (with surf racks for the beach), especialy with adaptive cruise control, blind spot info system and collision warning. Only superlatives."

Handling is terrific.  Acceleration is outstanding, with best low end torque of anything I've previously owned.  Turbo is very smooth.  Interior is comfortable and well organized.  Great soundsystem. Bluetooth works great.  Love the BLIS.  Luckily haven't had to test the city safety yet.  Love the exterior.  It's a looker.  Better gas mileage than others have experienced but not a sipper.

Would have liked homelink but not willing to pay for the unnecessary items in convenience package. Getting ~20 mpg with mix of driving (first 500 miles). Car is great in high speed sweepers-very stable. Quiet on highway. Baltic Blue/Black. Surprised how zippy considering it's 2 tons

Looked at Lexus, Audi, BMW, Ford.
Went with the Volvo.
Sharp looking vehicle, AWD, great ground clearance.
Drives very nicely, very comfortable front and back seats, lots of cargo room.
Have most of the bells and whistles (NAV, backup camera, sound system) and they are very nice.
Wife and kids love it.
After 1500 miles am getting 21.5 to 22.5 MPG in mixed city/highway driving.

FUNNNNNN to drive .....absolutly nothing to complain and to much to enjoy. Quality volvo, nice interior totaly different that other cars and i like it. Nice music system, phone connecion, and Ipod connection....
Just i am enjoing this car a lot. Even that i try to be green, with my second car being a Prius, i can not resist to drive the Xc60 instead of the prius. I known the dark side, but is an excellent car."
volvo,xc60,2011,mihali129, 11/21/2013,A reliable car that I want to like more than I do,3,"I leased this car beginning in 2011 and it seemed like a perfect match for me. I wanted an SUV as I need to get to work in even the worst weather conditions. This is my first Swedish car after years of driving German and Japanese makes.

The ride itself is firm. The acceleration is excellent with the T6. The XC60's only driving quirk that bothers me is that it has a very peculiar tight turn radius. That's fine if you want to make a U-turn in tight space but it actually takes care not to over-steer when parking.

The seats are remarkably comfortable in front and back and that cargo space is good. The electronics and build quality of interior materials leave something to be desired."
volvo,xc60,2011,rd940, 01/09/2011,Wow...and we thought the XC 70 was great!,4,"We took our XC 70 in for service and while waiting decided to test drive the XC 60...wow what a vehicle! Needless to say, the XC 60 came home with us. The XC 60 is a little smaller than the XC 70 but not enough to make a difference. Now after 500 miles we can honestly say that we are completely pleased with its styling, engine performance, handling, refinement overall fit and finish. Ours had a sticker price of $42,700 and we paid $38,600. (Includes the $1000 owner loyalty discount and the Costco discount) With a mixture of highway and city driving we are getting 20 MPG."
volvo,xc60,2011,bhelgesen, 06/23/2012,Great llittle SUV....I stress 'little',3,"Overall, this car is a pleasure to drive. With the T6 and AWD it can be a blast. This is my wife's car and she drives it like a soccer mom but when I run out in it, it becomes an animal and is worthy of any road or traffic condition. We came out of two minivans so maybe my expectations were low. For what it's worth, we put our 18 yr old in a 10 year old s40 for safety."
volvo,xc60,2011,shulmands131, 03/21/2011,Completely Satisfied,4,"I bought a 2011 (With Sensus) XC60 last month, and so far have been very satisfied.
I got the base model with Premium Pkg and Multimedia Pkg.
Only problem so far is the center channel speaker in the dash (only in multimedia pkg) rattles a bit at certain volumes/frequencies, but the dealership said they'd see if they can pad it some when I get time to drive over there. 

This is my 3rd Volvo and I love it!"
volvo,xc60,2011,jc12171, 05/18/2011,Very happy with the car...,5,"Looking for a small-mid sized SUV after my Altima lease,
consider and test drove Audi Q5 and BMW X3--both nice SUVs, but don't like the front grill in Audi and cheap looking front light on BMW.
XC60 definitely is the best looking of all three.
Plus better equipped and 5 yr free maintance, so went for Volvo.

So far everything has been meeting my expectations.
Very smooth and nimble handling with T6 engine. Comfortable seats, very little engine noise on highway.
After 1000 miles,
gas mileage has been better than advertised."

The car makes the commute so enjoyable, passing cars with ease all the while sitting in those so comfy seats listening to Pandora from my iPhone streamed through the speakers.
Also appreciate the fact that after a long hard day at work going home in this car makes me feel safe with all the wonderful safety features. I also love the fact that the the car is rare, compared to the
X3s, Q 5s, GLKs, SRXs and forget about the millions of RX350s. Volvo also has the best warrantee in this class. This is a no brainier, if you can find one.."

I know most car reviewers put the Audi Q5 over the XC60 but having owned a 2011 Q5 I can tell you they are wrong.
The XC60 has plenty of cargo space, the seats are the most comfortable I have been in.
Performance for the T6 model is top notch.
I have been averaging 25 miles a gallon to and from work (combined) and 28 on the highway (and I am not holding back)."

The build quality, interior comfort, and exterior styling are what drew me to this vehicle.

I did have this car upgraded to the Polestar improved performance.
This dramatically increases torque and hp.
I see a huge difference and I love it.
I would recommend it for performance, absolutely.
 I would not recommend it for its value. It is an expensive ""add-on"".
I did get a significant discount from the dealer, and I love the driving experience it provides.

The interior very high quality.
I really do not like the display in the instrument cluster.
They are very dated.
Volvo should use high res"
volvo,xc60,2012,beagleguy, 06/01/2012,An Excellent Vehicle,4,"This vehicle was delivered just over two months ago. I am very satisfied with it to date. Before purchasing it I considered the Acura RDX, Audi Q 5, BMW X3, and Mercedes GLK. I decided on the XC60 as having the best combination of style, features and performance. As I live in an area where winters can be severe AWD was a given. That being the case, when similarly equipped, the price difference and fuel consumption between the 3.2 and the T6 are not that great. Given other comments I've seen this was a wise choice. I would not hesitate to recommend to XC 60 for anyone in the market for this class of vehicle."
volvo,xc60,2012,mms34cougar, 02/15/2013,Skip the Tech Package,4,"I love this car!
It is fast (even with 87 octane gas), my back has never felt better (the seats are firmer than non R-Design seats), the premium sound is great, and with the Red R-Design we get compliments on the looks at least once a week.
The tech package is amazing when it is not broken.
We have had it in the shop 4x with a complete replacement & sensors that stop working.
Also, if you travel in snowy climates the parking distance, blind spot, collision & adaptive cruise can stop working due to ice build-up on your grill, bumper, and side window cameras.

Nav system reruns message ""system not available"" .
Blue tooth stopped working entirely
gate opener either doesn't work or works only within a few feet of the receiver.

XC 60. After buying it, I was actually complaining about this and that X 15 despite the many safety advantages. 
This '12 R Design Polestar upgrade has more than just the engine improved. All areas have been reviewed and improved, including the gas mileage, comfort, power (325 HP/354 lbs torque), ride quality, brakes and even air leaks. I could go on but the actual 10K price hike was to us worth every penny."
volvo,xc60,2012,Dennis, 09/23/2017,Beware of Volvo!!!!!,1,"Purchased this Volvo new and it came with a 5 yr/ 50000 mile promotional factory warranty that has just ended.  Aside from scheduled maintenance  volvo has either repaired or replaced under warranty the following: Battery twice ( car had to be towed in both times), plastic piece by rear seat headrest broke, plastic piece by rear seat fold down lever broke, AC condenser, gas gauge sending and receiving unit, rear back up camera, dash computer,rear hatch actuator,   Windshield was leaking water inside, has now developed a bad smell they believe is mildew caused by water getting under carpet from leaking windshield so they shampooed carpet, car still smells.  Based on repair history of first 5 yrs of ownership the time when the least repairs should occur it is obvious the car has issues. Now that warranty is up I contacted volvo explaining that I didn't think it fair that I find myself in a position that I pay $43000 for a car, maintain it well, has less than 50,000 miles and it appears I must sell it to avoid hefty future repairs. I asked them to  recognize that this is not their best manufactured vehicle and must be outside of what they believe is acceptable. I asked they either preferably  extend the warranty or if not provide a very good incentive to trade in on a newer volvo.  Their first response was to tell me that if any of the repairs made broke a second time they would ""consider"" at that time making the repair.  I asked to speak to the person making that decision so we could discuss and was told I cannot.  I wrote another letter to volvo a bit stronger and low and behold I received a call from the servicing dealer (Jaguar Land Rover Porsche Volvo of Greenville).   I went in and  met contact at dealer.  He looked at history and told me the following:  The car was out of service 28 days in the 5 yrs, it had been in 11 times for service in 5 yrs,  (This doesn't seem too bad however when something broke we lived with it until it was time for next scheduled service as we live about 40 min drive from dealer.)  Had I had to pay for those repairs it would have cost me approx $5000.  My feeling was that $5000 for repairs in the first 5 yrs was horrible this is when car should need to be repaired the least.  He then told me that bringing it in 11 times in 5 yrs was below average.  When I told him that Volvo cannot be proud of the repair history of this car and cannot think it is usual and customary he said that two of the repairs added to $2600 and if we separated out those two repairs the repairs history of $2400 was pretty good. While this is all going on they price my car for a trade in and give me a price of $11,000 that would be a 75% depreciation in 5 yrs  for a vehicle with no visible damage inside or out with less than 50,000 miles (kbb prices median trade in as $14,000). End result is volvo obviously feels and dealer rep has expressed to me that these repairs are normal and within acceptable limits I obviously disagree.  Also be aware that while volvo is responsive to emails you cannot speak directly with a decision maker they are shielded..Very frustrating..

volvo,xc60,2012,nelsoncm, 12/27/2012,I'd love it if my back weren't killing me!,3,"I was opting for something different from the series of wagons I'd been in over the past 12 years.
Saab, the maker of my past two wagons, was out of business, so I looked to the other Swede.
 The looks of the XC60 got me curious and all I had to do was put my foot to the floor on the test drive, and I was hooked on the performance of this car.
It's solid feeling, gorgeous inside and out and the warranty was impressive.
Plus I got $1000 off for staying with a Swede.
But my back and leg are killing me every time I drive it and for a few hours after.
Methinks it's going to be a very expensive trade-in for either a Volvo or Audi wagon."
volvo,xc60,2012,Roland, 08/27/2016,AWESOME TECHNOLOGY,5,"I traded my 2010 VOLVO XC60 T6 for a 2012 XC 60 T except this time I upgraded to the technology package.  I have had no problems with the vehicle and love the technology package.  I look forward to the release of the 2018 XC60 and hope it has lane control.  I also have a GMC Sierra which has the lane nudge feature and also love that as if I get to close to the lines in the road, the steering wheel turns back into the lane.    I presently have 44,000 miles on my XC 60 T6 and the mpg is way better than the ratings. I live in a rural area and my average speed is 50 to 55 mph and I am averaging 33 mpg.  The mpg has consistently improved as I get more miles on the vehicle.  I am a pretty conservative driver.

volvo,xc60,2012,OutdoorzDude, 05/01/2016,Very Impressed,5,"Owned two BMWs before this, our first Volvo and will not be going back.  Quality of materials and reliability much better.  Cost of ownership for 4.5 years and 75,0000 miles has been terrific.  Now nothing drives like a BMW but I am not missing the expensive maintenance and breakdowns that go with it.  Safety is second to none and plenty of room for my tall family of four.  Looking forward to the XC60 upgrade hopefully next year for our next one.

Update: 92,000 miles and still performing well, with nothing but routine maintenance required.

volvo,xc60,2012,drat19, 09/11/2011,Impeccable road manners; a few minor nits,4,"Traded in an '06 Acura TL for my new 2012 XC60 T6AWD because I needed some cargo carrying space but in a compact/midsize package whose cockpit could still accommodate my tall/big body.
Acura RDX was a finalist but then when I looked at the Volvo XC60 found too much more to like, especially the performance of the T6, and versatile interior.
My first 2000 mile road trip revealed a few minor nits (somewhat tight footwell space, a few bugs in the new Sensus system, quirky nav system), but the XC60's impeccable road manners overcome these nits...it's such a smooth performer with the T6, cargo capacity is superior for this size/segment, and the handling is also good for a relatively tall CUV."
volvo,xc60,2012,Dennis, 03/13/2019,Helga the hearty Viking,4,"We have a 3.2 premium, non-turbo. Pros: best safety scores in the world, gorgeous interior (gets lots of compliments), fantastic stereo (yes, even the base stereo), roomy for people and dogs alike (and the rear seats fold completely flat), comfortable ride (despite being a CUV and having the optional larger 18"" wheels), good visibility, City Safety will automatically stop the car if you don't see a pedestrian in the crosswalk (don't ask me how I found out). Cons: durability probably doesn't measure up to vintage Volvos; at 65k miles we've got intermittent noises from the blower motor and alternator, and every bump is registered with a muted ""tick"" from the cargo cover and door panels. Same deal with the seats: while they're still probably better than anyone else's, they're not as comfy as those in, say, an old 850.  Pro-and-con: the straight-six engine. It's tuned for low-end torque so it's an absolute beast from 0-30 but then runs out of steam quickly...so the Stoplight Grand Prix is amusing but highway merging and passing are just acceptable; similarly, city MPG is frankly dismal, while highway MPG is surprisingly good.

I've put 40k miles on it since then, and it is at the dealer for warranty work for the 4th time. It has currently been there for 5 weeks with no diagnosis, but I received word they would be rebuilding the entire engine currently. It would keep warning the engine oil was low, however when checked the levels were fine.  I expected this vehicle to last me another 10 years, but at this rate, I can't risk the warranty running out.

The navigation system responds well to voice commands, and the bluetooth integration with both Android and iPhones is excellent.
The navigation system, radio and media controls on the steering wheel are easy to use after a short learning period.


One unexpected finding was the seat comfort.
This is hard to appreciate on a short test drive, but apparent on long trips."

The only thing I really will miss is Homelink and possibly the fog lamps.

volvo,xc60,2013,Al C, 02/15/2017,Fun car to drive,5,"UPDATE 01/2018
Volvo stood by their warranty on the internal oil leak. After following the steps on the TSB, corporate OK'd replacing my pistons and rings at mile 66000. That's like a new engine..sort of. But my oil low indication has not come back and I'm a happy camper. I've had no other issues and look forward to driving this thing until my 100k warranty runs out, then I'll be ready for the XC90!

Ok, I've had my 2013 XC60 T6 AWD for over a year now. I love driving it. The engine power is more than enough to push back in your seat. All the interior gadgets make sense from a driver point of view. I can see why my insurance is so low on it, the safety features are overwhelming.    Now, the bad news. Little did I know this model/year is prone to an oil leak internally. You have to get your hands on TJ24643. It will describe the low oil level warning and how Volvo engineers fix (hide) the leak warning. Here is their thinking: Let's re-program the computer to alert at a lower oil level, then let's change out the dipstick with a longer one and move the Full/Low markings lower on the dipstick!! If the warning comes back after that, you have to haggle for a new engine.....So other than that, the car is a blast!!

I had a great experience purchasing it from Sandberg Volvo, after my local dealer wouldn't match the USAA price, and Sandberg gave me an interest rate 1/2 of USAA's.

The S60 and XC60 share many components, especially the interior, and I thought I would get about the the same comfort and fun to drive in a more versatile vehicle. I was wrong. If, like me, you are smitten by Volvo's beautiful R-Designs, make sure you spend time in those ""special R-Design sport seats"" to make sure you can get comfortable. Volvo just doesn't do sport seats right. For a company that's known for its superb seat comfort, that is a big disappointment. My S60 fit like a glove and was superbly comfortable. I want it back."

Tires still have plenty of tread at 56,000 miles. Maintenance provided by the dealer was very well done during the time we had the car. After the complimentary  three services were completed, the cost was a little steep, but they did an excellent job. I'd buy a new one, if I were in the market.

volvo,xc60,2013,Rogers Mom, 11/10/2018,My First Volvo OSD - Awesome!,5,"I purchased my Volvo XC60 by ordering it through Volvo's little known  OSD (Overseas Delivery) option.  The car made exactly the way I wanted it, I was able to get a color on that model that isn't available in the US, and interior options that also weren't available in the US.  Volvo flew me and my husband to Gothenburg, Sweden to pick the car up at the factory there.  We had a nice lunch there, they pulled it onto the factory showroom floor and gave us a thorough lesson on how everything works, set us up with auto insurance to drive in Europe and set us free.  We drove through Sweden and Norway.  The handling on the very narrow and winding roads through the Norwegian Fjords was awesome.  The steaming coffee cup warning telling me I seemed tired and should stop for coffee to rest only came up once on those crazy winding roads.  The car thought I was sleepy and gave me a warning!  That car has great acceleration for heavy metropolitan traffic.  It is so comfortable to sit in and passengers are likewise comfortable.  The only complaint I have is that it could be quieter in the car.  The road noise is a little louder than I'd like, but not nearly as loud as in my past cars.  Other than replacing tires and a couple of batteries we have had no major repairs yet.  We do stay on top of our maintenance and get that done exactly on time.  We just let go of a 2004 Volvo S60 that we had for its entire ""life"" and it still ran great.  Maintenance is the key.  As far as the safety equipment, blis, etc. it works terrific and yes, it will throw on the brakes when needed.  You do have to be sure that the outside sensors are clear of bugs or you might find yourself driving to a high pitched alert alarm without being able to turn it off.  I had this happen and it was just a bug that splatted right smack on the sensor at the front grill.  The car was sure I was about to run into something (all the way home) and it kept trying to tell me!  I could not be happier with my XC60.  We just got back from Europe where we picked up our second OSD, the all-new XC40.  What a sweet car!  I love my Volvos.  I highly recommend the XC60.  It has served me very well all these years and I would pick it again and again!

All my friends leased Mercedes ML350s for their wives and some complained about the car driving like a Jeep Cherokee with a better interior (I guess it goes back to Daimler owning Chrysler). When I drove the car and got some feedback from the Culver City Volvo, my concerns were
gone. The turbos are water-cooled and are just for the lower rpm, not like the high pressure turbos in Audi and VW that make the engine last less than 50k miles and no need to oil cool them by idling the car for 60 seconds before turning it off.

volvo,xc60,2013,David, 12/19/2015,What did I get myself into?,3,"I bought a 2013 Volvo XC60 3.0L V6 Turbo. I love how fast the car drives however, I've owned the car for 6 months and its been in the shop 4x since. There was an issue with the alignment but that was resolved (I had to take it to the dealer because when I took it to firestone 2x in 2 different states the car still didn't drive straight). I then had a problem where the car would not read most of my audio files on my usb, and then if there was a whole folder that it couldn't read it would completely stop working and I needed to stop the car and turn it off and on, (sometimes that didn't resolve the issue) that issue came back 2 more times since. I've had to replace the rotors twice already. It's almost as if they make them out of plastic. I had replace them because they warped, it made the steering wheel shake violently when I went 45 mph or faster. The car is a very rough ride, so if you have back issues I would look at something else. I drove for 11 hours and by the time we got to our destination it felt like somebody took a baseball bat to my back. I was looking for a reliable AWD vehicle because I live where there is a ton of snow and ice, also the closest Volvo shop is 4 hours away so I can't exactly pop in if I have an issue. This car is not that! I don't hate everything about the car, I love how stable it is at high speeds. I live where the speed limits are 80 mph and with this car passing is no issue. When you put your foot to the floor, the car goes into cheetah mode and takes off. Its AWD system is not the best, with its 60(front)/40(back) split. My sister has an 2013 Outback and that cars AWD system is a lot better than the Volvo's, hands down. The BLIS package has some issues, it gives you false readings quiet often, that being said it saved me a few times. I have LED headlights that have the active bending feature which helps when driving at night through passes. I like this cars parking sensors, they've saved me countless times. I get 17-18 mpg around town, and 19-20 mpg on the highway however, I do have a heavy foot. I can deal with most of the issues this car has but, the rotors anger me every time I think about them. So the question is would I buy this car if I knew everything I know now? My answer most likely would be no. My reasoning is mainly that the rotors are expensive and putting down that much money so often is problematic. Not mentioning how much time this takes, last time it took the dealership 5 days to replace them. So if you are a fan of back pain, and you have money to waste, and you have all the time in the world this car is the perfect car for you! I think next time I would rather buy a V6 Subaru Outback!

volvo,xc60,2013,Roy from Michigan, 11/12/2016,Xc-60 Turbo Review,5,"Purchased this car after trading in a Honda CRV which was a very good car as well but wanted an all wheel drive SUV. Lots of choices but style and performance is important to me as well as space for utility and projects. The turbo charged engine is quick. It is sure footed on bad roads my state is known for. The ride is stiff but controllable but I like sport like handling and emergency avoidance features this Volvo has as standard equipment. This is safe and only real issues is first: rear seats very tight for adults but not often used in my case. Second controls are very different from what I was used to and had a learning curve which you must study to really use them properly but having no navigation and knowing the system it is fine now. My insurance went down, the safety is great, performance great, mileage is what you expect (25 mpg highway, 17-20 city), seats very comfortable, and styling very sharp and usable space well designed. Volvo dealers are not common but close enough that it is not a problem and reliability has been good. In short I would buy this safe premium SUV again.

Sport mode is fast with tight paddle shifters and body hugging contoured seats providing comfort after a long day of touring.  The XC60 is one of the safest vehicles in the world and now even more so with state of art technology and aggressive accident avoidance via performance characteristics.  The rear cargo area is spacious enough to accommodate my road bike or mountain bike, foregoing noisy, wind resisting sport racks.  The gas mileage needs improving with some help burning (factory design) regular fuel.  The vehicle has been trouble free for two years of ownership and 25,000 miles of driving.

Absolutely love this vehicle!  I had narrowed my search to a Acura RDX or the Volvo XC60 and found the safety features, the nimble and quick handling, sleek exterior design and the straight-forward, understated but more than adequate interior won out in the Volvo.  The RDX had a dull feel to it compared to the energy and zip of the XC60 and the rear-end design of the RDX fell short.  My gas mileage has been phenomenal using the ECO feature and it has the same getup and go as a Acura Integra I once owned.   I have Blind Spot technology and the protection package, both features I find helpful.   The cargo area is just what I was looking for and like the idea the seats all lie flat.  Most of all it is fun to drive!

volvo,xc60,2015,scott, 09/20/2015,UDATED March 2020 *** This one is a keeper **,5,"Our sticker starts with a T6 AWD, then adds the Climate Pkg, Convenience Pkg, Sport Seats, Proximity Pkg, 20"" Titania wheels, Metal flip-down cargo cage, Harmon Kardon sound & Piano Black inlays, totaling over $50k.Lexus should buy one of these and just sit in it for a while. The ergonomics are top-notch.  Every knob, every stalk, every bin just falls perfectly into your hand. The configurable dash is cool at first, but eventually you find one of three  choices you really like and stick with it. The center stack is a bit over populated, but you get used to it, and once you locate what you need all subsequent operations are logical. The engine is sweet, and I mean SWEET. Zero turbo lag....max torque is ready and willing anywhere in the rev range. Couple that plant-you-in-your-seat acceleration with fabulous seats, and you've got an hours-on-end cruiser that is unequaled. Or a refined city errand-runner. Whereas the Lexus was dowdy and boring, the Volvo is crisp and entertaining. This is eye candy for the CUV crowd.
**UPDATE**  3-20-2016  Had the good fortune to road-trip with the Volvo. What a great highway cruiser. Power when you need it, suspension soaking up all those nasty road imperfections, and a whopping great stereo. A clear winner vs the Lexus.
**UPDATE** 9-21-2016 The T6 continues to impress. A summer full of highway construction has not deterred this black beauty from traveling anywhere, anytime. It is the perfect blend of utility vehicle and sporting machine. The twin-scroll turbo puts power on your foot RIGHT NOW and smoothly pulls all the way up to speed. Need to pass at freeway speeds? Once again that twin-scroll turbo launches you past the unsuspecting. I know it's an SUV, but this really is a great car.
**Update March21, 2017** Just had the 20,000 mile service performed, still under warranty and didn't cost a dime and that included replacing wiper blades. Our Bobby Rahal Volvo dealership continues to impress...not at all like the Lexus dealer next door who barely acknowledges your existence unless it is time to pay. 
September 2017 
Still in love with the Volvo. Tires are ready to be replaced at 22k. The dealer wants to perform an alignment along with a top tier  price, so we looked elsewhere and the $1400 Dealer price is down to $988 without an alignment. The car doesn't need it as it tracks true as the day it rolled off the assembly line.  Everything works as it should. The styling is still crisp and fresh. This is one well-designed mode of transportation!
March 2018
Volvo keeps sending us sales stuff to get us to come look at the new XC60... Why? This is a great all-around car. Winter snow? No problem! Our only complaint is how hard it is to keep the car clean!
Sept 2018 Zoomed past 30k. This car is tight, quick, comfortable and roomy. Recently rented a 2018 XC90 and was not impressed...will be keeping the XC60 with it's fabulous engine, perfect transmission and great brakes.
Sept 2019   Four and a half years in and this car rewards you each time you press the starter button.  Had the unfortunate rear-ended-by-a-dummy that required some minor body work so we had the body shop refresh the paint... it looks showroom new. WOW. Everything still works as it should. Engine, tranny and brakes are a harmonious unit that perform so well together I can't believe they discontinued this engine. 
Our dealer experience has tempered our enthusiasm. Every visit for a fix has required a minimum of two trips. Regular maintenance is never an issue. For example, we got a warning message the Volvo on Call needed updating. We never signed up for or used the service. Contacted the service and the car would not stop redialing the service! First dealer visit they  told us they removed the feature.....only to have the message pop up about two weeks later. Second dealer visit seemed to be fixed only to have a front warning message upon
 pickup.... back for third visit.......seems they don't know how to properly close the hood when delivering cars. Sigh. 
The only other negative is the driver side leather is wearing much faster than other cars we have at similar ages and similar usage. We regularly treat our leather interiors so it has not been neglected...the leather is just a bit on the thin side.Other than that, this car rocks! We are confident it will be in our garage for 10+ years.
**March 2020** Found a new dealer who did our 40k service. They are twice as far as the other dealer but well worth the drive. The car is just humming along. No mechanical hiccups. Just pleasant, reliable motoring week after week. I would not hesitate to buy one of these used. Coming out of a mild winter, it still looks showroom new. What a great car!

volvo,xc60,2015,J Miller, 03/31/2016,Love My Car,4,"I bought the 2015 Volvo XC60 as a demo with low miles about six weeks ago and I really like it.  The ride is smooth and fast, and stereo system is crisp. I love the rain sensor,  and I really appreciate all the safety features (parking assist, BLIS, rear camera). There are a few things I would change about the interior design though.  For example, the design of space for storage between the front seats is not very practical.  The cup holders are also positioned so that can they interfere with the gearshift.  The navigation/sensor software is functional but not very intuitive, especially compared to systems in other luxury brands.  Overall though,  I am happy with my purchase.

volvo,xc60,2015,Joeyomitan, 09/04/2015,Fun to drive but falls short on MPG,3,"Second write up after nearly two years and 20,000 plus miles.

The oil issue went away.  After the first oil change it seemed to stop burning oil, a good thing.  Gas mileage has not increased.  It still averages about 27 on the highway and less in town, maybe a 24 mpg average,  less than we expected.

The user interface still confuses my wife, it is not very intuitive.  

The car does drive nice and has good performance, by far its best point.  

Another issue is oil changes.  Volvo has told us due ""they"" need to put it on the computer to do an oil change,  Jiffy-lube or Firestone, etc should not do it.  I still have yet to verify that.

We have found the Volvo dealer no better than the local Chevy dealer, we make appointments and they lose them or tell us when we bring it in its first come first serve.  My wife refuses to take the car in for service due to she is frustrated with the dealer.

So the bottom line after two years would I recommend it, probably not.  I have a 2014 Chevy equinox AWD and a 2011 Honda CRV, the Volvo  is  nicer to drive, but  issues,  such as Volvo states they need to  do oil changes, MPG falls short, the blue-tooth/entertainment system is years behind the others.  I was afraid to buy Chevy but all five drivers in my family except for my wife like it the best.  

So in my opinion for the price  the Equinox or CRV are a better buy.  


First write up.
First off I would say this is the best driving car we have ever had.  It handles very well, has better than average acceleration, stops well, steers well, etc.  The interior is nice, our only complaint is the “storage area” under the radio, you can’t really put anything in it or it falls out when you turn.  The seats are comfortable, and cargo space is adequate.  

Our big complaint is gas mileage.  The T-5 Drive E engine should get 24 in town and about 30 on the highway.  We rarely average over 23 mpg. On our Honda CRV and Chevy Equinox we always meet or exceed the EPA estimated MPG, so I don’t think it our driving habits.  Either Volvo over estimated MPG or who knows. 
 
The only other complaint is the information/blue tooth system is not very intuitive.  The local Volvo Dealer had to contact other dealers on how to check the oil level from the info system.  The car does not have a dip-stick.  The manual does not describe how to do it  My wife or daughter still can’t check the oil level using the information system.  Checking the oil is much like running  old DOS commands from function keys on your keyboard.  

The engine does need oil added between the 10,000 mile interval oil changes.  Typically at 4000~5000 after an oil change it needs oil.  Volvo thought this would go away after the first oil change, but we had to add oil at the 13,000 mile mark.

volvo,xc60,2015,ToddW, 11/12/2015,Utilitarian luxury,5,"We have the Platinum T5 e-drive and it's different than any other car I've been in.  The interface for radio and ac and tech is somewhat simple, but the car has fantastic safety tech, and the simple interface is nice. You turn a dial to adjust the temperature, you don't scroll through your touch screen. Turning safety features on and off is simple, there are dedicated buttons, and the adjustments and customizing for those features is made using the screen when you're not driving.
I actually bought this for my daughter. I had narrowed it down the Honda/Acura and the Subarus due to their great active safety features, but sprung for the Volvo since it's safer and just nicer in a lot of ways. 
Interestingly, you'll find the Subaru scores higher on active braking because it triggers auto braking earlier and stops you completely when approaching a car at 25mph. With this Volvo, you'd still hit the car, but at a slow speed.  What the IIHS testing doesn't tell you when it compares these systems, is that Volvo uses both radar and a camera. The Subaru uses a camera that can easily be blinded if you are driving into the sun. The Subaru does warn you the collision avoidance system can't ""see"", but the Volvo simply doesn't get blinded. I prefer that. It is also built a bit stronger, and seats you wonderfully. The honda and acura use ""radar"" too, and are very nice for the price.

volvo,xc60,2015,john delaney, 02/08/2018,My last Volvo,1,"While this car drives well it's given me a ton of problems, generating a lot of repair costs and frustration.  While under warranty I had lots of little problems, and the check engine light came on so regularly I ended up having to buy a code checker to avoid constant trips to the dealership or somewhere like autozone to have it read.    One of the reasons it kept going off was the gas tank was visible machined poorly, so no matter how well I attached the cap the check engine light for emissions would come on.  It also burned through oil on a few occasions.  I took it to the dealership immediately, but they couldn't ever find anything wrong.  Other problems were generally small issues like sensors or spark plugs going bad.  These were an inconvenience, but they weren't major and were covered by the warranty so I didn't care too much at the time .  At about 55,000 miles the car suddenly started emitting a very high pitched squeal.  I made plans to take it to the dealership the next morning.  In the morning the check engine light was on, and it also started revving uncontrollably when stopped at stop lights.  Eventually they informed me the bearings in both cam shafts went bad, and the thermostat needed replaced.  This was about a $3000 repair cost, and they said it would take about a week because they had to order the parts.  It took the dealer 7 WEEKS to repair my car.   They seemed incapable of ordering the right parts or ordering all the parts they need.  They did not keep me informed at all, and I constantly had to call and check in.  Half the time they weren't able to provide me a time estimate at all, and they other half of the time they said it would only be another couple days.  I spoke to Volvo corporate, left messages for the manager, etc, all to no avail.  Finally they called and said it would be ready the next day, only for them to discover something else wrong with the car.  When they finally finished all the repairs I picked up the car, and immediately noticed how heavy the steering felt.  I thought it was just because I'd been driving a different loaner vehicle for the past 7 weeks  (Honestly it had been so long I kept reaching for the wrong controls in my car once I got it back).  However, after a couple more days it became clear something is now wrong with the power steering.  Now I have to decide whether to take it back to the same dealership and see if they will fix it for no/reduced cost since it was likely the result of something they did, or take it to a different dealership which might provide better service.  Either way this is definitely my last Volvo ever.  We were thinking about an XC90 for my wife, but now there is no way we'll even consider it.     About the only thing positive I have to say about the car is that it averaged about 28-30mpg for me, but the savings isn't worth the other costs and frustrations.

The price was considerably lower than comparable vehicles.
The Volvo XC 60 has the most comfortable seats of any vehicle I've ever driven.
Its safety features were top of the line.
It had all the options I could get from other vehicles, and more.
I listen to educational and music CD's and only with the Volvo could I replay a section I wanted to hear again.
This feature used to be available in most vehicles, only Volvo kept it.

Have had problems with minor things like sunvisor breaking, hatch door not responding to triggers, some electrical issues - they were all fixed. 
A customer service rep emails me regularly, making sure all my questions and issues are handled.

volvo,xc60,2015,doktor, 04/02/2015,Great Car... Horrible support from Volvo,4,"The XC-60 continues to do very well.  Gas mileage is a bit disappointing.  21 city, 25 hwy.  I had a problem with the auto-stop and it took three visits to a dealer to get it fixed.  Each dealer blamed the other.  It has been working for a month so I hope this is done.

I purchase a 2015.5 XC-60 4 cylinder turbo charged vehicle in February.  The vehicle is great...
Unfortunately, Volvo support is awful.  The XC-60 comes with a print manual of about 200 pages and there is an on-line manual of 400 pages.  Sadly, the manuals are either wrong or incomplete for many of the features.  No mention of multiple dashboards, no mention of setting mpg vs instant mpg, low pressure tire indicator directions are wrong, no mention of how to collapse the back seat.... I could go on.  The arrogance:  I called Volvo and the young woman told me Volvo never changes their manuals once they are printed.  I asked:""even on line"".  No never, for more than $40K: this is customer service?

NEW COMMENT:

My most frustrating current problem is the stop/start system.  I have had to take it back for repair four times and now will take it back for a fifth.  It sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  It has gone out completely twice.  Once they replaced the car battery and the second time they said the dealership didn't reset the system.  

Our newest problem is with the start/stop system.  This will be the 5th time taking it back.  It went out completely in the first year and they replaced the car battery.  It went out six months later and the dealership claimed the tech didn't reset the system.  It is now incremental.  Volvo will tell you (they evidently have this writt



I have two major gripes about our Volvo XC-60:

1.  The back seat is unbelievably uncomfortable.  The backs don't recline at all and is very uncomfortable.  This is unlike our GMC Terrain, where the back seat can be moved back and forth about 10 inches, and the seats can be placed either upright or reclining a bit.

2.  Learning to use the technology requires an extensive amount of time with the manual.... which does not include much of the information you will need.  Setting bluetooth, radio stations, GPS are all several step, complex processes.  WHY?

New Comment, April 2019.  

The stop/start system doesn't work at all.  Finally, the dealership admitted that the computer is set so that no matter the battery charge the stop/start system won't work.  Tried another new battery and Volvo can't reset the computer to kick in when it should.  You would need a constant 15 volt battery for the system to work.

At 30K miles, we had to have the rear brakes replaced.  It was only discs and the charge was over $500.  My local shop won't touch cars with electronic parking brake.  Another major repair and we revert to Acura or Lexus.

volvo,xc60,2015,Shon Johnson, 12/12/2015,Best luxury SUV ever,4,"I looked at several luxury crossover vehicles before buying the XC60. This is my second Volvo (my first being a S40 ) and I didn't think that I would love it as much as I did my S40 but Wow is all I can say! I thought a Volvo SUV would be boring and too old-fashioned but I was wrong. I would buy this 2015.5 again and again. I love running errands and taking long drives because it great on gas mileage and it is so nice to look at both inside and outside. Another plus is that it doesn't sit so high off the ground that you have to hoist yourself up just to get in like my Expedition. This XC60 is the perfect size.

volvo,xc60,2015,Lisa, 07/12/2015,Second Volvo and Even Happier,5,"This is my second Volvo and I traded in my Volvo S60 to buy the XC60.  I was looking for more space without sacrificing good looks and performance.  I love the XC60.  Volvo makes a great quality product for a good price.  And since the car takes 87 octane and 5 years free maintenance, the cost of ownership is really good.  Also the service department at the dealership that I purchased both my Volvos from is phenomenal.  The service staff is very professional and always helpful.  I would encourage anyone in the market for a car to take a look at the Volvo.

volvo,xc60,2015,susan, 07/10/2015,Steamn in STL,1,"I bought My 2015.5 Volvo xc60 January of 2015, July 2015 transmission goes out completely........no accidents or rough terrain or mishandling of the vehicle in any way. Computer has had several glitches generating problem messages regarding  functions in the vehicle. Cars in the shop at present. I have traditionally kept my vehicles and maintained them for years after purchase. I don't see that happening with my Volvo. Instead I am looking into lemon laws for my state.

In any case I would  "" steer clear "" of this Volvo for sure.

volvo,xc60,2015,very41, 02/23/2015,All-around Family SUV,4,"iI never regret to buy this car. There is nothing I disliked about this car!
Engine is powerful, handling is more than enough from me (don't usually drive on the rural roads, so don't do sharp turns).  Fuel Economy is not a strong suit, but it is well above 22mpg for mine, which is not bad at all for a turbocharged V6 engine.
Interior design is elegant, I got black dash with creme leather, also a contrast color steering wheel which I love, the infotainment system is well designed, no stupid touch screen, and I love buttons, it's just so easy to use! Also, there are many little features that make you happy about this car, such as the interior lighting while driving and a lot more."
volvo,xc60,2015,William Stellin, 04/30/2017,Throttle lag,3,"My car has an unsafe throttle lag when starting up from a rolling or very slow speed. I've almost been hit several times trying to get into heavy traffic. Dealer has had the car for 15 days over 3 visits. Fault codes say nothing is wrong and car is performing as designed. They will do nothing more. The car is unsafe and I want it fixed but dealer and factory says it's ok. I say it is broken. I love all other aspects of the car. Problem started when the car was driven out of the dealer lot brand new. Service manager recognizes something is wrong but without computer proof can do nothing.

volvo,xc60,2015,JB, 04/24/2018,Loving our XC60,5,"I really wanted a manual VW Alltrack.  But, after test driving it, the interior felt kind of cheap.  We did a lot of research on the XC60 and just got ours a few weeks ago.  I was a little hesitant because our V50 had a lot of issues.  However, I really love the look and feel of the XC60.  I wanted a T6, but our local mechanic recommended the T5.  He thought the T5 has fewer issues.  So far, so good.  It’s a really great combination of luxury and safety features.  The leather seats have that nice “real leather” smell.  I absolutely love driving it.  I’ve been using the sport shift a lot, which is fun.  I miss my manual V5”, but this is such an amazing upgrade.  I have no complaints about the pickup.  I haven’t noticed a throttle lag.  Based on my research on reliability, we payed extra to get an extended warranty to 100k.  I’ve never done that before, but just don’t want to risk it.  Now were thinking about some accessories like a roof rack and possibly a toe hitch.  Fingers crossed about future ownership, but we are loving it so far.  Also love the Harmon Kardon sound.  Only complaint is that the Nav is really hard to figure out and the sensus system is a little clunky."
volvo,xc60,2015,Talia, 04/29/2016,Good for family with only 1 child,3,"I purchased a 2016 XC60 this past December since I had a brand new baby and felt we needed a SUV for safety. The SUV is overall very safe im sure but the accessibility of the backseat is ridiculous. I cannot tell you how many times ive hit my head trying to maneuver my sons car seat into the middle seat. The only way you can easily get a car seat in the backseat is if you move either the driver seat or the passenger seat forward almost completely. My husband is 6'1"" so if he is driving you may as well count the driver side of the car out in terms of being able to put a baby into the back.  For the amount of money we paid for the vehicle i assumed the backseat would be comfortable which it is not for an adult. I am only 5'4"" and am incredibly uncomfortable when i sit in the backseat with my son, to the point where you have to sit sideways because your legs have practically no room. I feel this is a HUGE design flaw on Volvo's part! If you only have 1 child and don't count on having any more then this is the car for you. However if you plan on having more kids good luck to them being comfortable in the back seat! I cannot wait until it is time to buy a new vehicle which is unfortunate because I heard such great things about Volvo's but probably will never buy another one again!

volvo,xc60,2015,cmvolz, 12/25/2014,Very happy with XC60 T5 after 6 months.....,4,"We downsized from our XC90 to the XC60 T5.  I was apprehensive going from an AWD platform to the FWD.  But thus far the XC60 T5 has been just terrific to drive, extremely responsive, fuel economy as advertised and the turbo makes it quite the pocket rocket.   Lots of compliments too.  Dealer has been great.  This is our seventh (7th) Volvo over the years and the XC90 is the most fun Volvo yet."

Awesome drivers car, great brakes, excellent steering feedback, and deceptively fast. Compared to BMW and Audi, this one is the way to go. Easily $5-8K less expensive, and has been very reliable. Great dealer support. Compared to my friends with Mercedes and BMW's, I am a happy camper! At 63K miles still trouble-free and very happy with this car. The 3.2 liter 6 cylinder is awesome.

volvo,xc60,2015,chas16066, 08/03/2014,First and Definitely Last Volvo,3,"Safety features are outstanding, but after driving car for 2 months, each day is as frustrating as the last in how poorly designed the interior is.
Virtually no place to store things.
In order to reach something easily (while driving), it has to be in one of the two cup holders.
Bluetooth and iPod functionality is unintuitive.
I have had to memorize exactly what will work when, which has relieved some of that frustration.
Lots of reviewers praise the comfort; it has been more comfortable than Toyota Highlander, but not by much. Most frustrating : the poor service of ONLY Volvo dealer in my area. Not having a choice for service has been a major mistake."

I actually ended up with skin cancer in the same spot where the seatbelt rubbed for years. Additionally this car has had electrical problems from the start.

Beat out Edge and Murano, way less than Audi or X3. Drives very smooth, amazing seats, great acceleration.

Otherwise, I am very pleased with the car--everything is well thought out, intuitive, and the car is a true pleasure. I opted for the platinum/BLIS/heated seats etc.  pkgs. and all of the added safety features are amazing. The workmanship, build quality and thoughtfulness of design shows here. Frankly, I haven't had anything to criticize or second guess. I would suggest that u drive several models to find the right engine, AWD v. FWD etc before choosing.  The combo I chose emphasizes a more cushy ride which is what I was seeking. Remember, that you have the option of getting 19 or 20 inch tires. I stuck with the 18's and no complaints although some may find this model not ""sporty"" enough. I did rent an AWD while in Canada for a week,  and found that model to be faster and sportier. The choice is yours!  Also,  I chose the base engine and it is more than adequate and zippy. 
REVIEW UPDATE after 6  1/2 months and 6,500 miles: Great car. No complaints and drives quietly and smoothly. No squeaks, rattles etc--top notch workmanship here! Only very minor complaint is I wish the handling were slightly  more sporty. Interestingly, sadly I was rear ended while at a light. The other car had major damage in to the engine compartment. My car had barely a scratch! This car is a keeper.

UPDATE on 12/11/17: So far I  have almost 20K miles and this car has been perfect in reliability. No issues whatsoever. I only wish for more storage in the front of the car and for slightly sportier handling characteristics but overall i would definitely buy it again.

My car has died on me 3xs in the last few months while in Eco mode, and even when I'm not in Eco mode, my transmission is sluggish and choppy.

volvo,xc60,2016,Tom Keenan, 11/06/2016,"A Safe, Comfortable, Practical Luxury Car",4,"My vehicle priorities have included safety, comfort, durability/fuel economy, and carrying capacity (cargo, dogs etc.), in about that order. This is our 4th Volvo since 1990. The other 3 were wagons (a 240 and 2 V70s).  The last one we bought now is about 12 years old with over 220K miles; until this past month it has required little more than routine maintenance but now it is starting to show its age.  Good price incentives in July encouraged me to buy new.  I chose the XC60 over another 70 series mostly for the styling and extra ground clearance in the XC60, and because cargo capacity isn't as big a priority for us anymore. The XC60 is a very comfortable car with supportive front seats and enough leg, shoulder and head room for my above average male body size. The drive-e engine delivers surprisingly good fuel economy for a car this heavy, yet acceleration also is more than adequate for my needs. The leather seats are beautiful, although I would have preferred the cloth upholstery that has held up so well in my old V70 for 12 years.  Another thing I miss is the fold-flat front passenger seat in the V70, which allowed me occasionally to carry long items such as lumber (but then, I wouldn't want to do that in a car this nice). The infotainment system keeps me entertained and informed with more choices than I really need. It's a little more complicated than I would have preferred and I'm afraid it will seem dated within a few years. The ""premier"" version is nicely equipped as-is, without adding expensive options.  If you're comparing alternatives, Subaru is another (less expensive) make I'd consider, especially if you want AWD. Volvo prices seem to run lower than you'd pay for most Lexus, Audi, BMW or Mercedes models (unless you get into the bigger, more expensive 90 series, which would've been more than we need).

volvo,xc60,2016,Sam Brown, 05/31/2016,Great car for a long commute,4,"I bought a 2016 XC60 T5 Premier in Flamenco Red with the Soft Beige leather interior.  The only option is the BLIS package.

I drive 160 miles a day, mostly on interstate.  The XC60 is great on the highway: Smooth, fast enough, quiet, stable, and big enough to inspire confidence.  I get about 28 MPG on the highway using regular gas.  I generally cruise between 75 and 80 mph, and the XC60 is a fun, satisfying, soothing car to get home in.

And while it’s not a sports car, the XC60 is also fun and comfortable on twisty back roads.  It’s small enough to feel nimble and pointable—not at all trucky.  I can’t compare it to an X3 or Q5, but it compares favorably to my previous Mazda3, especially given the Volvo’s different mission in life. Good steering feel, balance, grip, and braking.

The seats are great once you get them right.  That took some doing but now I have a great position saved in memory.  The leather and other materials seem nice now, but a year-old used one I looked at had not held up well.  It had done time in New Mexico—I’m hoping the heat was a factor.

The only feature I would change is the start-stop system.  It’s an interesting idea and sometimes works well, but more often is an annoyance.  It should be permanently defeatable, instead of having to be turned off every time.  I also think a back-up camera should be standard, especially from a company known for safety.  And it’s a little more rattly than the Japanese cars I’ve owned, but I kind of expected that.

Overall this is a great car for me right now.  Comfortable, classy, fuel-efficient, satisfying to drive, and, as long as it’s reliable, I’m looking forward to my three daughters using up whatever’s left of it when I’m done.

Am coming from a 2009 X3 3.0si with stick shift.  This is the first automatic transmission I have owned in years and I am REALLY impressed with the engine/transmission combination.  Drove 200 miles on 2 lane roads the last couple of days  and did lots of passing.  Shift into sport mode and stomp on it and the acceleration is instant.  No hunting for gears at all and in sport mode the transmission really holds a gear.  Even in regular mode I've been impressed with the transmission.  Well worth the extra couple of grand for the Drive-E T6 engine.  Ride quality is very nice, better than the BMW.  Handling isn't quite as good as the X3 but is fine for the kind of driving I usually do.  I'm very happy with my choice, having looked at the X3 and Q5 too.  Much better value for the money than the X3 and wanted the extra room of the XC60 compared to the Q5.

volvo,xc60,2016,Blaupunkt, 10/19/2016,A Premium Crossover that won't break the bank,4,"THE GOOD: Competitive pricing, ample cargo space, reliability no issues, nice design, fast shifting 8-Speed Aisin automatic transmission, fit and finish, real leather seats, adaptive display easy to read speed and tachometer, relative quietness, panoramic sunroof, low maintenance cost, regular (87 Octane) fuel,  satisfactory handling, little to no turbo lag, quick throttle response in sport mode.  THE BAD: Fuel economy not on par with EPA (c/h/m 22/29/24 vs reality 20/24.5/21.3), no ventilated seats available, no sync button for dual zone climate control, short-life wipers, cumbersome and un-intuitive infotainment system, intrusive start/stop system, torque steer and frequent tire spinning with FWD (AWD offers much better handling especially at full throttle from standstill), two stage door opening when locked, some door panel and city safety device rattle. THE UGLY: Raspy and unrefined 4 cylinder engine (especially at higher RPMs where the engine sounds like a turbo-diesel), engine clatter at idle, ordinary ride quality not on par with a premium crossover, clunky transmission, odd lurches from a standstill and sometimes at parking lot speeds.  THE VEREDICT: A good value proposition, well planned with the need of some fine tunning in a competitive market segment.  Albeit, if you are looking for more refined vehicle manners in terms of engine note (6 cyl Acura RDX) and ride quality (Lexus NX, Mercedes GLC) or engaging driving experience (Porsche Macan, BMW X3, Jaguar F-Pace, Audi Q5) you will probably have to disburse thousands of dollars extra.

It's not perfect but it is very much nothing to complain about. I love the interior tech. The Platinum package is the way to go. You can do R-Design Platinum but the version is simple a few bells here and there, essentially it's the same car. The Navigation can be a bit more intuitive but as of 2018 model, that's all done and over with. This is simply all about the ""up to 2017"" models. I would simply say, if you're considering this kind of a car, there is no reason not to own one. It is a fun toy to have and it will do the job very, very well.

volvo,xc60,2016,Don of Cincinnati, 06/19/2016,A bumpy ride,4,"Paid about 47K for the Platinum package and in general pretty nice car. It's my wife's driver and she's very happy with it. This car is way too rough on bumps etc. My 37K new Honda Pilot is a plush ride comparatively. The XC is peppy and really kicks it, but I'm very disappointed with the joltiness of the ride.  The tech package is OK, but lacks walk away locking and you pay a monthly extra for remote start. The driver/passenger heat/ac lacks synching which has become fairly common.

12/20/17  We've had no problems with the vehicle.  Remain irritated with their stingy control over remote start.  It's $499 if you want it added to the car.  MPG is not impressive at about 17 around town.  The 2018 XC60 is tempting, but our next will probably be an all electric from?

12/20/2019 We became tired of the cramped feeling in the car. I did pay extra for the remote start which was worth the money. At 30K miles they wanted $500 to redo the back brakes and I'd had enough. We lost 50% of the value. I tried to get Mrs to switch to Honda, but no. Purchased the 2019 XC60. It's roomier with some better features, however the remote start add-on is not available. After 4 years of free remote mobile phone start, you have to pay. This is a good scheme to sell you a new Volvo.  I hope by then my Mrs will be ready to leave Volvo.

volvo,xc60,2016,former volvo family, 07/23/2019,2016xv60 t6 with polestar,3,"Car has been in for service now 4 different times so same problem.   Intermittent error lights, abs, tire pressure and city safety.   Dealership waited out the warranty so now Im paying for repairs that started under warranty.  We have two xc60`s and the 2015 has the same error.   Interesting that you get a service inquiry whenever the error lights come on.   It appears Volvo has lost its long term dependability and the service has erroded.   After 4 family Volvos we are shopping for a different car.   Real sad since we have had older 200k miles with other volvos.

volvo,xc60,2016,alex peirce, 04/06/2016,Safety and comfort,5,"Review for Volvo
Volvo has been around for decades and have been setting the safety standard for years. Not only are volvos safe, but there also comfortable, stylish/perform well, dependable, and affordable. I am a very picky person when it comes to cars and it takes a lot for me to consider a car. When I look at buying a car I look at the overall styling of it, if it is comfortable or not, if it is dependable, but above all I look at how safe it is and in my opinion volvo blows all of these categories out of proportion.
SAFETY- As I said before Volvo has been setting the safety standard for years; they have come out with everything from the three point seat belt or pedestrian detection with full auto brake to auto pilot system on cars. Volvo cares deeply about the safety of their buyers and unlike other car brands that put luxury first or convenience they put safety first. All Volvos come standard with a pre-collision system called city safety. In my opinion volvo cars are the safest cars on the road today.
COMFORTABLE- Volvo also cares about how comfortable its passengers are. Volvo has gone as far to have special seats designed by orthopedic surgeons to make the ride of a volvo more comfortable. They use very nice soft to the touch materials in their cars that its passenger appreciate.
STYLING AND PERFORMANCE- Volvo has sleek designs that set them apart from other auto maker from there Thor Hammer headlights to their distinctive long LED taillights. When you see a Volvo on the road (especially the new ones) you can tell it's a Volvo because of the sleek styling of it.I think that Volvo does a great job of making their cars head turners. For years Volvo did an ok job in the performance, but in the last decade they have really been improving the performance of their cars. All their cars come standard with turbocharge engines, but for those who want a little more of a driving experience like me, you can get a special line of Volvo called the R-Design. The R-designs come with special turbo engines tuned by the Swedish racing company Polestar (Polestar also tunes the suspension of the car). I own a Volvo XC60 R-Design which is a crossover and it feels like I’m driving a sports car like the Lexus IS or BMW 3 Series.
Dependability- Volvos are very reliable I have never had a major issue with mine and neither have my family members who have one. There a little more expensive to work on but they’re worth it.
AFFORDABILITY- Volvos have a long range of price tags, but for what they are there very reasonably priced. There prices range from lower $30,000-well over $90,000 in the U.S., but you can get a year old volvo in the 20's.

No issue to even complain about none zilch zip zero not. I want a cyber truck in the middle range. They are no doubts the way to go next meaning battery power. By 2021 the middle range one should be good for almost 400 miles of range. 20 % Inc. in new batteries. The 500 mile one should reach 600 miles now also 20 % of 500 is 600.

volvo,xc60,2016,Norma, 12/06/2018,Why did I wait so long to get a new-to-me Volvo,4,"I had a 2010 Volvo XC-60 with 137,000 miles; I kept putting off buying a new or new-to-me car because I did not want a car payment after I paid of the 2010.  I started looking for vehicles Summer 2018, test drove 3 cars, but they were all Dark Blue and had more miles and more dings, scratches, etc. One had low miles, but a long of dings on the passenger side of the vehicle.  Still putting it off after my work started, I was determined to find a car over Thanksgiving break.  There were two vehicles that caught my eye. I went to look at one on Sunday and sent in an internet interest request. I got a call on Monday, let them know that I would be there Wed. at 1 p.m. (appointment).  By the time I got there, they had sold the vehicle at 11 a.m. or so.  The internet contact let me know someone was taking the car for a test drive at 10 a.m. or so. That was a 2017 model with 21,000 miles.  So, after that did not go well, I began re-searching and looking at my next choice, which was a low mileage 2016 model. I have had it a week and I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade!  :)

volvo,xc60,2016,nigran, 03/19/2016,It is an expensive car.,5,"I thought I had preparation to make a deal based on edmunds.com recommendations.   I only realize that edmunds.com did not help the clients to make an intelligent guess.   The value stated on the edmunds.com is much higher than Kelly Blue Book.   So I am not sure if edmunds.com intends to help car seekers or help the car agents.   When I got to the car dealer, they made a different gimmick and I end up paying a high price, even beyond what I intended to.    There are too many packages and it was not clear what the difference is between Drive-E versus platinum.

volvo,xc60,2016,David , 09/16/2020,2016 XC60 Needs a new engine - and Volvo USA is tu,1,"48,100 miles on a XC60, all the service records intact, barely out of warranty, and the engine dies. Whether the problem is in the head or the cylinder is not clear, but the Volvo dealer is quoting me a new engine at $17k (note: the book value of the car is $16k). So logically we asked Volvo USA to review our case and, ideally, help us out somehow. Isn’t that reasonable? They flatly denied us, it took them all of one day to decide, so I guess we weren’t even close. Can you believe that? The car was taken care of, and the service records prove that, and their product failed us ... massively. What kind of company would leave us 100% on the hook like that? I’m sure these things happen now and then, but not to us, and not so massively, and not a couple month out of warranty, and not without the mfg showing some degree of concern. I’m telling you, my other car is a Tesla ... just get a Tesla and don’t waste you time with Volvo. The are beastly overweight dinosaurs and based on my experience ... unreliable."
volvo,xc60,2016,Drew, 03/12/2017,Best of Europe,5,"This is my second Volvo and the first one I had went over 100,000 miles with no service calls outside of general maintenance.

volvo,xc60,2017,E.B. 96, 12/24/2018,Settling in for many years of ownership,5,"My 2017 XC60 T5 Dynamic has been a great car. I bought it after having my 2011 VW Touareg TDI bought back after the whole Dieselgate situation about a year and a half ago. My old car had some pretty significant reliability issues, and having this car consistently perform without any issues or unexpected problems has been a breath of fresh air. Specifically, the car is a great long distance cruiser - set it on cruise control at around 70 MPH and it will easily achieve 30 MPG on regular fuel. Compared to the vehicles I was cross shopping, the comparably low cost of ownership/operation ultimately made the decision easy for me. I test drove BMWs, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi products but all of them had questionable reliability and operating costs that were, in my opinion, not worth the extra effort and cost. The front seats are exceptionally comfortable, but being a taller and frankly larger driver, the rear seat legroom behind my seating position is not as generous as it would be in some larger competitors. I have had the car serviced once, and only two other visits to the dealership to have the coolant levels topped off and a styling accessory installed. I do have to say that after about 18 months of ownership, my only complaint has been a seemingly sharp decline in resale value, and jealousy looking at the newer XC60s, but I plan on holding on to this car for quite a while and the potential for high-mileage and long-term ownership has kept me driving my car.
"
volvo,xc60,2017,Nicole, 07/19/2017,I had such high hopes....,3,"1500 miles driven so far...encountered three issues (all were ""reset"" by turning the car on and off again.) First, the power lock on the driver side door decided not to function one day, but hasn't repeated yet.  During a heavy rain, the auto folding mirrors would not fold back out after turning the car on and off several times. It later reset after being parked for an hour and I was told by the dealer to push the left and right mirror command buttons at the same time which should cause the mirrors to fold out if they are stuck. Best of all, I believe the parking break malfunctioned, triggering the check engine light to come on and the car to be undriveable. After I safely rolled into a parking lot and turned the care off and on it appears to be fixed for the time being. I'll be making my first trip to the service department before I make my second car payment!  There are some good things: Acceleration is great for a 4 cylinder and size of the car; Tons of cargo space + panoramic sun roof made for some luxury car camping; Very comfortable (and great gas mileage at about 30 mpg) on a 8 hour road trip; Bluetooth integration is fairly seamless (wishing the car had apple play) and the navigation system has a very nice feature where the next turn displays in the instrument panel so you don't have to keep looking back at the screen. There are many things I really love about this car, but the reliability issues have me feeling pretty disappointed. I'm glad I leased.

   Pro's: a) seats are really comfortable (this is a renowned attribute, but I can confirm); b) fuel economy is decent (averaging 25mpg so far); c) plenty of good features (heated steering wheel, ability to start the car from my iPhone etc). d) build quality seems good - nice thunk when closing door etc.                                              Con's: a) handling is just OK; b) heated front windshield has annoyingly visible heating wires; c) infotainment and instrument panel is definitely showing it's age ... one example, no ability to see phone messages; no ability to change speed display to km/h (would have been useful when driving to Montreal)

volvo,xc60,2017,Roger K, 01/06/2020,Liked A4 Premium Plus Better,3,"Wife's car.  She likes Volvo for roadtrips with her girlfriends.  I love adaptive cruise control.
Best mpg so far 27 (trip computer read 28.3) in 50 degree weather 75-80 mph w/cruise, no AC. Insurance is cheaper than 2013 A4 was.  Memory for electric hatch is a plus, so it doesn't hit the top of the garage door.  Normal driving mpg average 21-22.  Regular gas major plus.  Handling is good on tight turns, very firm suspension.  Bought car used only to find out passenger seat doesn't fold forward; this is a $100 option, option code # 000298.  Dumb.  Don't need to fold passenger seat often but, when needed this is a major fail.  Had '93 850 GLT with passenger that seat folded flat, standard equipment.  Sometimes owners want to carry long items like 8-10' dimensional lumber; use my 2016 VW Jetta for those tasks.  Auto engine shutoff is very annoying, but can be shutoff.  No hardcopy owner's manual with car, but it is available via the infotainment system.  Got a pdf copy off internet; now can print out page(s) for whatever is needed .  Whoever designed the interface for the infotainment system had his head up his rectum; not intuitive or user friendly.  Power seat memory buttons need to be held depressed to move the seat; should follow the lead of other manufacturers and use a momentary contact switch to move the driver's seat.  Uses an oil filter that is only accessible from underneath (have to remove plastic belly pan to access).  If there was a dipstick and topside oil filter, could do oil changes with a vacuum device.

volvo,xc60,2018,M,Jones,In my humble opinion this is the best luxury SUV.,5,"I honestly believe that this SUV is hands down the best luxury SUV available in the segment. I test drove the Mercedes Benz GLC 300, Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace, Mazda CX-9 (X3 2018 was not available to test drive) and at the end the Volvo was the winner. To me, the design of the Volvo is the most modern and elegant of the bunch. The engine on the T5 is on par with the Base models of the other brands. (@250HP and around the same torque) The cabin set up for convenience of the driver, the blend of technology and amenities on a simple yet elegant design made the XC60 the best. I was a little concerned with the performance and almost decided to go with the T6 but I honestly could not justify the extra money, the engine performs just fine for the type of driving I do. The noise levels at highway speeds are just right, not so quiet that you fall asleep but not so loud that you can't carry a conversation. The R-design specs are certainly  worth the extra cash, the fit and finish of the seats is impeccable. The steering wheel, shifting paddles, aluminum accents, and the overall environment are just way above the German and British competition. One characteristic that I have really liked is the suspension. My only test drive was on a XC90 T5 and on that occasion I noticed some plushness to the suspension, specially when compared t my old BMW 328i. On the R-design suspension that feeling has not been present, it is firm but not uncomfortable it just feels sporty to the point that you forget you are driving a 4000lbs+ SUV. I have never owned a Volvo so the question of reliability and quality long term are still out there. Without a doubt my initial impression to this point has been 100% positive.

Compared to my former Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Explorer, it is much more connected, easy / fun to drive and luxurious feeling inside.  The safety technology and driver Pilot Assist 2 are amazing.

volvo,xc60,2018,ESK, 12/21/2017,Nice ride with a couple idiosyncrasies,4,"T5 momentum with navigationPro, Vision Package, Heated seats/steering wheel, keyless entry, base 18 inch wheels. 2200 miles, 25.5 mpg in mix of town/highway. Base engine/ 8 speed is more than adequate highway or stop and go. Base interior is significantly upscale to our 2011 XC60 T6. Ride is too although maybe not as playful/connected to the road as our 2014 X3 2.8. There are times when the 2.0 of the XC60 is less refined than that of the X3, say accelerating up a long hill, but the XC60 wins in overall comfort in my opinion. I liked the lane keeping feature at first but now find it annoying. If you change lanes without signaling the car will fight with you. Luckily it can be deactivated and left off. Unfortunately, the start/stop needs to be deactivated every time car is started, requiring a couple extra swipes of center screen that gets old. Leading edge of sun roof sun screen buzzes but can be addressed by rolling it back a cm or so. Traffic flow status, green/orange/red colors, took a while to figure out how to enable by activating car modem in communication menu. Sometimes the center screen menus can be a bit slow to boot up when car is started. Overall very happy so far."
volvo,xc60,2018,Mink70, 05/01/2018,A Rated Car with C Rated Nav and Computer,3,"Bought this SUV for my wife replacing a loaded 2018 Audi Q5 because the seats were very comfortable for her, and we really like the dealer. The Audi seats hurt her back so we sold it back to the dealer with less than 2000 miles on it (OUCH!). Inscription has amazing seat adjustments, features and comfort. Terrible window glare off dash during daytime unless drive wears sun glasses. Visibility is good, though the BLIS could have been made more pronounced in the side mirror. No mfg compares to Audi on the BLIS system visibility. The infotainment computer, while billed as working like an iPhone with a home button, is cumbersome, slow and difficult to learn.It takes forever to download updates, and notices of them are very misleading.  Navigation graphics, operation and search results leave a lot to be desired ( I could use a crass word but won't) especially compared to the Q5. Its choices of routes are very poor. Shuttling between screens is distracting, and the screen does hold finger prints very easily. There should be some dash button to push for the most common features, e.g. cutting off Eco mode and 360 camera. Mileage so far is not ok and disappointing. Has yet to average 20 mpg much less the advertised mileage. Interior wood trim  (driftwood because Volvo ran out of other wood grain colors) and  leather colors are limited and a bit ugly compared to all competitors. The newer electric silver exterior color is very handsome and would be prettier if the interior leather options included a true beige with walnut trim. My wife really likes the car, but I can say I barely like it.That might change after we take it on a trip. Were it not for the dealer, with whom we have had a long, wonderful relationship and is excellent, I probably would like the 2018 XC60 Inscription T6 less. Just hope it is durable and lasts for the 10 years my wife had a Toyota Sienna.

volvo,xc60,2018,John Denver, 08/20/2018,Great High Tech suv.,4,"Leased a T6 Inscription with the Advance pkg in mid june 2018, after driving it Vs the Merc GLC, Jag E pace, BMW X3, & Porche Macan.  Didnt even bother testing the made in mexico Audi Q5.   
Far & Away, the Volvo T6 hp, torque, and highway passing performance are all superior to the other base engine suvs I tested,  & at only a modest price premium for the very impressive T6 engine, which I average 24mpg here in Denver.

I’m a tablet pc user, so I really enjoy the intuitive, in dash, touch screen on the volvo, and the Heads up Display for speed & nav.  Only the jag was similar.  The Porche Macan is a low tech, dated suv, & very disappointing as a result.  My 2nd choice was the Merc GLC which is a close 2nd to the XC60 performance wise, but it can’t match the high tech in the Volvo, and could not take a class 3 trailer hitch like the volvo can.

My only knocks on the volvo are  minor, ie Boot time for the screen needs to be faster,  Bliss doesn’t work with my bike on the trailer rack, The engine stop/start can’t be turned off indefinitely, 
Wiper switches are overly sensitive to accidental activation, sun screen is too big & slow to operate, Handling wise the car is at least 200lbs too heavy & tends to plow into corners on twisting mtn roads, and the highway collision avoidance system is a bit over sensitive at high speeds of 75+ mph.

This is my first volvo car, and overall I’ve found it to be a great suv with a lot of value due to it’s balance of doing so many things well vs the competition.  "
volvo,xc60,2018,Nils, 11/30/2018,Both an emotional and intelligent choice.,5,"As it came time to downsized from a larger SUV we wanted a vehicle that looked great on both the outside and inside; was fun to drive; and had all the most recent drivers aids and safety kit. The Volvo had everything on our wish list and for us was the most comfortable car to drive (e.g., the legendary Volvo seats are great on long trips).  We got all Volvo options on the car except the more powerful engine (e.g., the T5 engine power is more than adequate for suburban driving) and the air suspension (e.g., the steel suspension felt fine to us, but that is a subjective decision). We have had the car for six months with no issues and after a short time mastered the sensus connect and all the new features the car came with. If you decide to buy a Volvo look into the European Delivery Option.  The Volvo delivery process in Sweden was great and we had a wonderful time in Scandinavia. You will also be surprised, as we were, with the travel benefits that come with the program and the additional savings we received off the purchase price.

volvo,xc60,2018,Volodoscope, 04/18/2018,Volvo’s best and safest SUV.,5,"Volvo brand has always been my favorite. Their Scandinavian design, simplicity and their attention to complete safety is what kept me with them for many years. With the recent changes with Volvo, it’s only more clear that their future is going to be amazing. They have completely rethought their car line, and with the new XC60 they are gonna be very recognizable on any road.

This is my first SUV, and I wouldn’t have gotten it if it wasn’t for the beautiful design of XC60. This size is not too big and not so compact like other luxury makers. I got the T8 Twin Engine trim with 10 kWh battery that gives 18-20 miles range on pure electric drive.

My favorite things about the car:
-air suspension is incredibly comfortable and soft
-remote start, pre-cooling, pre-heating all though the Volvo App is amazing, even works with my Apple Watch
-comfort and quietness of the cabin
-design of the interior and the screen interface and interaction
-internet in the car, over the air updates of all maps, installation of free apps
-Volvo’s own sound system is superb
-Spotify 
-Apple CarPlay
-Autonomous Drive is very accurate from everyday driving to work
-auto braking and crash avoidance is amazing
-once a year maintenance is a breeze
-electric drive is so smooth and quick, it almost feels like a mini Tesla
-LED lights are beautiful and bright enough in all situations I’ve experienced
-size of the XC60 is just right

Things that can improve:
-Volvo needs to work with dealerships more and be allowed to fully update the car over-the-air
-charging speed could improve with time, with software updates too
-transition from engine to electric needs more ironing out
-more options and controls in the user interface and the screen, few more options to make the car your own and have more customizations
-Volvo needs to help plug-in hybrids to find charging stations, they kind of let that up to the driver

Overall this is the best car I’ve even driven, even comparing it to cars I’ve been in, like Audi and BMW, Volvo always takes on extra points on character, design, and comfort. This is truly Scandinavian philosophy, nothing more and nothing less, just what you need, and after driving it everyday I can see it very well.

volvo,xc60,2018,Michael, 01/18/2019,A couple of shortcomings short of greatness,4,"This is a longer term update to my review and reflects the software update that was done at the dealer last month which improved the responsiveness of sensus quite a bit. It's still slow but I'd no longer consider it a hazard.

This is a very well made car with a couple of significant issues. One, the Sensus system is not good. Don't get me wrong, it looks beautiful with it's big center screen and has lots of features. The problem is it is slow.  Two, the ride is ridiculously rough. Going over anything larger than a small divot in the road sounds like a sledgehammer hitting the suspension. I don't know who drove this car in pre-production testing and thought this was acceptable but that person should be fired and never allowed to work in vehicle engineering again. 

On the upside the car looks beautiful inside and out. It really looks like it was lovingly handcrafted, particularly the seats which are amazing. The engine, despite being tiny, puts out a really surprising amount of power. Unfortunately the gas mileage is not good. However, I've found that if I use ""eco"" mode I can do pretty well on mixed city and highway driving and right now I'm at 23.7mpg. The Pilot Assist is reasonably capable. On a highway with well painted lines it can keep you in your lane as long as your hand is on the wheel. Obviously it doesn't have any of that next level stuff you see in Teslas but at least Volvo is trying...hopefully the system will get better with software updates (right now it just gets totally lost if the lines are faded). However this model will obviously never get any major Pilot Assist upgrades, the hardware can't handle it.

As for value I pumped that up to 4 stars because as far as I can tell I can sell the car right now for almost what I paid for it which is pretty amazing. Granted there aren't many 2018's for sale yet so the market isn't very deep. But as a comparison, my prior Ford Edge had lost almost 1/2 of it's value at the same point in it's life.

I've upped my overall review to 4 stars and it's really only losing a star for the very rough ride which is a darn shame. I assume volvo CAN make a car that doesn't feel like I'm riding on bare metal but they just didn't and I can't figure out why. I can understand why Sensus is slow, they just didn't put in a powerful enough processor which, while also a shame, is kinda understandable because very large center screens are fairly new. But suspensions are very much not new and there is no excuse, none, for how rough this car rides. But overall, assuming it's not going over bumps, it's a great car that could get even better if the next software update improves the Sensus and the Pilot Assist (hint hint volvo this review could go to 5 stars).

volvo,xc60,2018,Al, 03/13/2018,Love it so far! Annoyed with 1 major feature.,5,"Quick break down of model and features.  T6  Momentum Denim Blue Charcoal interior-- Convenience package, Vision Package, Advanced package, Navigation 12.3, heated seats/steering wheel,  & 20 in wheels.  Looks-- this suv is one of the best looking on the market, the body lines, wheels, thor hammer DRL's, aggressive front fascia, and LED taillights. Sick.   Performance--- This SUV pulls. Select the Dynamic mode and this thing is out.  Really tunes motor to higher revs.  I would say this is more for highway driving. really can't use  mode for city driving it's to fast. I stay in comfort mode for that and that' the default setting any way.  Steering and handling are very good no sports car but can handle it's own.  Interior--- is very comfortable and cleanly designed..  Only issues I have like others do  is the HVAC controls are thru touch screen.  I love the IPAD feel but still would like knobs and buttons. THE biggest issue is the start and stop tech, my wife and I HATE IT.  it shuts suv off to fast... you have to manually shut it off everytime you get in car and that SUCKS.  Other than that I love it!  I bought it for the way it feels drives and safety. autopilot is crazy, lane keep , and heads up display are awesome.  Go test drive 1!
"
volvo,xc60,2018,MB, 12/05/2018,Truly one of the last European SUV you can buy,5,"I have owned this car for the past year. I pre-ordered the car and came from Sweden as one of the first R-design model available. I really love the car, it is so comfortable and so perfectly finished that I can only hope the reliability of the brand matches its fit and finish.  The engine could be a bit more refined but for a 4000+lbs SUV it does the job really well. The transmission is great and it works just as expected depending on the MODE you have set. (ECO, COMFORT, or DYNAMIC) One of the features I like the most is the center screen as well as the digital instrument panel, it is well made and has so many options that allow to customize depending on what the driver wants.  I tested many SUVs and it truly was the best of the bunch. I will only hope the reliability is what I am expecting but so far so good. (specially when all maintenance is covered by  Volvo, It is an incredible warranty and great piece of mind)

Update on the Volvo XC60: 06/17/19
The car has become my second car, now that I get to compare the two I realize how great this car really is. Still a little noisy, coming from the engine compartment but since tire noise is more notable at high speeds it doesn't seem to bother me as much only at high revs on low speeds. I currently have 13000+ miles so I am still hoping for reliability to be good but so far I have done brakes under warranty (because the wheel would shake a bit under braking with some uneven feel. The dealer said they had a re-design or quality recall by Volvo.)  At this point only complaint is that I'm trying to get Volvo to replace some window trimming that is pitted (or some kind of rust on the mate finish of the windows bezels.) Last time I took it to the dealership they said that they couldn't see it but it is still there. 

Everything else is working great granted I'm not driving it as much.

volvo,xc60,2018,Lee Zimmerman, 05/13/2018,Problems,3,"BUYER BEWARE - VOLVO XC60

My new Volvo XC60 is a very nice car, great features, however if you are thinking of buying one there are a few issues that bother me:

-The sideview mirrors tend to not open when the weather is cold

-When the windows get wet or frosty they go up and down extremely slowly

-We opened the driver door on a day when the winds were 10-20mph the wind took the door, causing a pin to break and requiring over $1000 in body work - not covered by any warranty  

-To reset the apps that are on the computer display in the car, you have to drive for 30 minutes over 50mph

Fields Volvo of Northfield said “All these things were not covered or acts of God.” 

When I tried to get Volvo USA involved because I feel that these are design flaws, I was given the run-around and a snow job and I found it nearly impossible to get Volvo USA to take it seriously. 

BUYER BEWARE!

volvo,xc60,2018,DJMSN, 08/22/2018,Really want to like this car but cannot,2,"Bought this car almost 1 yr ago and I have had it back in the shop 3 times already for repairs.  The car is driven daily already has close to 13500 miles so I have definitely broken it in and spent lots of time in this vehicle.  I have to admit this car was not my first choice.  I wanted a Honda CRV.  I traded a 2004 Honda CRV with over 160K miles for this suv.  I never had any issues with that car or my Honda before that one.  One major complaint is the lack of an owner's manual.  The manual is in the car's infotainment system or you have to download it to a phone or other device.  This is really inconvenient, especially when experiencing a problem.  Twice I experienced turn signal and windshield wiper malfunctions.  Warnings were popping up in the center console and the infotainment system (and don't get me started on how cumbersome that is to operate).   Neither functions operated so makes vehicle unable to be operated in any precipitation.  Very scary to drive when you have 3 children in the car and losing functions.  Also received a battery failure warning on the first occasion.  1st time back to the dealership they had to wipe the computer clean and download all the software again.  Took hrs.  Was promised car fixed.  2nd time (yesterday) they replaced the turn signal and wiper module which was defective.  Took hrs.  Was promised was fixed.  We shall see. It is sad when you carry a towel in the car to wipe mist, etc off you windshield.  The dealer showed me pages of error codes that were downloaded from the car from malfunctions.   I think there is another problem with the computer because now it is taking a long time to load the instrument panel.  Also seem to be getting strange images showing up on screen.  Hard to describe.  The nav updates constantly and that was also fixed yesterday by re-downloading the software.  Dealer said it was stuck in a downloading loop.  The nav is terrible, we call it the crazy gps because it sends us all over the place.  I hook up the android auto and use google gps instead.  12V power outlet in front center console already blew a fuse.  Never had that happen in any vehicle I have ever owned.  Door trim on driver's side passenger door replaced due to manufacturing defect.  I have begun taking pictures and videos of malfunction warnings and irregularities have been experiencing.  So I have documentation of all issues.  So far everything covered under warranty but worried about future.  Had high hopes and expectations for this suv but I already want to get rid of the vehicle.

I really wanted some kind of autonomous driving in the SUV.

volvo,xc60,2018,Jim McCandless, 07/01/2018,All you could ask for in a compact suv,5,Nothing better than driving a new car every few years. I have been leasing for the past 20 or so years and the new Volvo is the one that I will buy after this lease is up. My choice was the T5 Inscription and I am not disappointed with this suv. 
volvo,xc60,2018,Gratunell, 04/15/2018,"Luxury SUV, but...",4,"Great car. Definitely Volvo has earned his position as luxury brand. I did test drive Audi Q5, MB GLC and BMW X3. I leaned towards the Volvo, for excellent design exterior and interior, although I have to admit it was a difficult choice, except for the MB GLC which was ruled out right away due to its outdated features and poor exterior design. The XC 60 is extremelly comfortable to drive, with the Inscription trim it looks awesome, modern and offering a sense of peace and quiet inside. I will focus my review on things that should be better (hence my 4 star rate instead of 5). Some of the materials in the lower part of the dashboard, doors and central console should be of better quality for a $ 54K vehicle. Performance is its weakest part, I got the T6 because compared to Audi Q5 or BMW X3 acceleration and quick shifting was subpar on the T5, with the T6 it gets better (in dynamic mode) but still it is not an Audi, so if you are looking for spirited performance go with the Q5 or the X3. Fuel consumption is poor, and definitely below what Volvo advertises. Noisy during acceleration, once you cruise it is quiet. On the Inscription trim premium sound should be standard (as it is in the Q5), so I decided to go with the regular audio system (definitely not great sound. Go with the Bowers & Wilkins premium sound if you can afford it. It is worthy). Suspension is on the harsh side. Don't get me wrong, overall is a fantastic car, interior feeling is luxurious and safety features and infotainment is last generation. Exterior and interior design is outstanding (Audi or BMW are not closer. Their interiors are boring ).

volvo,xc60,2018,Bob, 01/23/2019,Buyer Beware,2,"I have had 5 quality related problems with this car.  The dealer never has the parts so each one requires two trips with weeks of delays.  Here are the quality issues. 1.) The Driver's side dashboard had a flaw and needed to be repaired/replaced. 2.) the front rotors warped at 5,000 miles and needed to be replaced.  3.) Excessive paint swirls in the pillars that had to be machine buffed out. 4.) Rear window washer stopped working. 5.) Check engine light came on and now they want to pull out the gas tank fill tube and replace it with a new design.  I wrote Volvo and talked with the dealer about returning this car or being compensate for the dozen or more hours and hundreds of miles I put out for theses issues.  They told me ""sorry, they can't make everyone happy"" .  Please avoid this car unless you want a bad quality car with a good warranty and a company that doesn't mind deceiving you.

volvo,xc60,2018,john Melin, 10/07/2017,What a difference,5,"I had considered an xc60 in 2014 but instead opted for a xc70....This time around the style and upgrades won me over.  I have only owned it for 2 weeks but it keeps impressing me with comfort and technology...I am still learning my way around the dash but Volvo did a great job on this redesign......
"
volvo,xc60,2018,MINK70, 07/13/2018,Disappointed,2,"This is a follow-up to a prior review. We now are almost 7 months and 6,000 miles into ownership. While the seats felt comfortable at first, one round trip of 4 hours each way left my wife aching all over. The headrest is fixed. For some it will throw the head forward and for others the gap between back seat and headrest causes upper shoulder and neck fatigue. The seat bottom bolsters also are pronounced and fairly stiff. These headrest and seat features have caused my wife such significant hip and neck pain that she is seeing a physical therapist and has required her to switch to driving my Audi A6. I now have been assigned to the XC60 which was not my choice of vehicles. 
Until just recently we had yet to get over 24 mpg on a trip, and the city mileage rarely exceeded 15 mpg. I got 28.9 on a recent 150 mile round trip by letting the cruise control etc essentially drive the car. 
Access to surround camera for parking is cumbersome, as it does not engage automatically even if the car is in reverse. (Audi has a split screen) In many circumstances we need to stop the vehicle, put it in neutral, slide the screen, find the camera icon and then touch the 360 icon. Setting destinations remains hit or miss, though the Bluetooth interface with our iPhones is very good. I am still wondering whether future info system updates will improve visual effects and function. No promises have been made by dealer. 
We have thought of selling the car to buy or trading for another brand with more comfortable seats. Those options are out of the question because we’d take too big a financial hit off the price paid for the XC60. Our experience is that the more comfortably riding SUVs or Crossovers either do not have some of the safety and convenience features we want, or truly are not comparable or have not been given very good owner ratings. 
So, my wife and I decided to keep the XC60 for at least a couple years, switch cars to break in the seats for a period the seats can be better broken in. "

volvo,xc60,2018,Dan, 04/07/2019,Not what I expected,2,"I expected everything to work as advertised for the price. The voice recognition is the worse I have used in over 10 years - it may as well not even be there. Road noise in this car is far higher than many much lower priced cars - I would have expected a car in this price range to be much quieter. The foot operated tailgate very seldom works. It has a lot of safety technology but because of the lack of an operating voice recognition and the poor traction in bad weather, it is really not a safer car at all. Plenty of cargo space, very good fuel mileage, plenty of power and drives and rides well on dry roads. It is very poor on snow covered roads; almost scary. I would definitely not buy another one. I changed the tires in an attempt to get a quieter ride - no good but better traction than the factory tires. I have also been to three dealers and none of them are at all helpful with any of the problems. After two years owning this vehicle, I am hoping to be able to trade it for something better

I printed out a technical journal for this problem and they did have the car for several days and did all the recommended “fixes” - did not solve it. Regional field rep was called in. He admitted that he felt the vibration. Said he had it on his Volvo and that getting Michelin tires seemed to help.  Again, IT’S NOT THE TIRES.

I think I would opt for a T6 next time. The safety features are great and the semi-autonomous driving is fun and a little addicting. Interior of the car is striking and very user friendly. Have had a chance to take the car out in the snow, and it handles fantastic. Reviews continually say that the touch screen is hard to use, but we found it very user friendly and have had no issues.

I bought it new because I wanted a luxury car with environmental qualities and after researching, was pleased with the positive reviews.  I mostly drive around town, so the 18 MPGe were perfect.  We had an electrician come and install a 240 outlet in our garage for faster charging.  Two and a half years later the battery will only charge to 12 MPGe.  Took it in for servicing and they said, ""per the owners manual, the car is performing as it should.""  I looked in the owners manual.  Here's what it says:

The capacity of the hybrid battery diminishes somewhat with age and use, which could result in increased use of the gasoline engine and consequently, slightly higher fuel consumption.

I am so very disappointed.  Good luck trying to trade this car in...who wants a hybrid that is loosing it's hybrid capacity.  I just want to warn those who may want to buy the newly advertised XC90's.  If you only want the car for two years, go for it.  But don't expect much out of this hybrid in the long run."

Two visits to fix.  First required a $1,000+ parts and labor repair.  Second, a $2,500 headlight units plus $700 to repair.   INSANE.  Lease and ditch is the only reasonable option on Volvo cars today.  The electronics are expensive and not designed to last.

volvo,xc60,2018,Dan, 08/26/2020,Disappointing,2,"I leased a Volvo T8 with every bell and whistle, including air suspension, red key, heads up display etc.  Sticker was over $75k.  It's a beautiful and comfortable car but I can't wait to give it back.  The front dashboard rattles miserably on the highway.  It truly drives me mad and makes me feel like I'm driving a Yugo.  The dealer said they put padding/insulation but it has not fixed the problem.  The 13 mile electric range is too low to be useful and the raspy 4 cylinder engine provides unrefined power/acceleration.   The brakes and brake feel do not inspire confidence.  I've also had countless technology glitches.  For example, the wipers decided to stop working right before a heavy rain storm.  I rushed home, parked and charged the car, and the next morning before I could call the dealer the system reset itself and worked fine.  Strangely inconvenient.  These type of random technology glitches happen unexpectedly and too often to be normal.  The pilot assist moves the car around too much and the car does not track straight.  Tire wear has been excessive.  Disappointing to say the least, especially given the leather seats are beautiful and car is beyond comfortable.

volvo,xc60,2019,Steve in Louisiana, 08/23/2018,Upon Further Review...Volvo XC60 T6 R-Design is it,4,"In trying to find a new car replacement for my 9 year old Audi A4 3.2L Prestige S-Line, many vehicles were considered ranging from Audi (A4, S4, Q5, SQ5), Mercedes (C series, GLC), Mazda (CX5, 6), VW (GLI, Tiguan), Honda (Accord, Pilot), and a few others.  After months of reading articles, owner reviews, and searching websites like Edmunds, etc., it was time to make a choice.  Using my admittedly personal weighting system, many factors such as exterior styling, fuel economy, ease of ingress/egress (some of us are getting older and less flexible than we used to be), interior functionality, safety, and more were evaluated and, as can be read, the Volvo XC60 T6 R-Design was selected and ordered to get the exact option packages we wanted.  We ordered the car in February of this year as a 2018 model year, but the 2019 model was delivered 4 mos. later.  The Dealership held the 2018 agreed price on the more heavily featured 2019 model so thanks Volvo for that.  We strongly considered the T8 (hybrid) version but ultimately rejected it because the new car is intended for highway trips and the additional 500lbs or so would hinder highway fuel mileage.  While we only have 1500 miles on the R-Design, so far it is everything I had hoped it would be.  It is a superbly comfortable and quiet highway cruiser (indicated 28.2 mpg Interstate, 24.5 mpg combined) that provides a safe, serene, solid, and yes, even sporty-ish driving experience.
Learning the new tech and interface in the center console takes a bit of a homework, but once the preferences are set and the short learning curve is attained, controls seem logical and well laid-out.  Steering wheel controls and voice commands handle the majority of routine functions (e.g. radio/music selection and volume, cabin temperature, text message response, automatic cruise control, Pilot Assist, etc.)  Favorite features so far include the 1) aforementioned auto-cruise control, head-up display, 2) Bowers & Wilkins audio system, 3) fuel economy, 4) comfortable R-Design seats, and 5) general driving dynamics.  A few of my nit-picky dislikes in no particular order are: 1) lack of a sunglasses holder in a overhead bin 2) somewhat unpleasant engine sound under moderately hard acceleration (cruising noise is virtually silent) 3) lack of available CD player (yes, I'm showing my age, but I have a lot of CDs).

UPDATE:  FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER

The XC60 continues to meet and exceed my expectations.  After several 600 mile round trips, puttering around town, and  a total of 18,600 miles on the odometer, there are ZERO mechanical, electrical, interface, or infotainment issues. None.  No squeaks, rattles, shimmies, or, loose trim pieces.

 The  R-Design has had one oil change service and software update (neither of which cost me anything) and another service is due in a couple of weeks.  The engine has not used any oil in the roughly 9000 miles of use since the last oil change.  The A/C system is terrific, cooling the interior quickly in these hot summer months.  All the safety systems continue to function as advertised and impress my occasional work mate passengers.  Interstate cruising is quiet, relaxing, and unstressful.  Certainly the driver still needs to monitor the road and input steering as required, but the automatic cruise control and lane keeping systems help the miles melt by. 

Fuel mileage also continues in the upper 27-28 mpg range at interstate cruising speeds (70-75 mph), and strictly around town driving yields low 20s mpg.  We continue to appreciate the very comfortable seats, excellent Bowers & Wilkins audio system, and roomy interior.  The XC60 is the optimum size for us and our travel and commuting needs.

Because this is my first experience, much less, my first ownership of a Volvo product, I was very skeptical.  The vehicle would have to ""win me over"".   After nearly 18 months of living with
 it, would I recommend the Volvo XC60 T6 R-Design?  Unquestionably.

volvo,xc60,2019,Kim, 07/14/2019,"Overall, I love it.",4,"I have a 2019 T5 Inscription. Overall love the car, but it isn’t perfect. Here’s a list of my perceived flaws: 1) Engine is loud & shifting is not smooth in lower gears; 2) You can not respond to a text unless you’re connected to Android auto/Apple Play; 3) Rain sensing wipers must be turned on/off & are not actually automatic. Technically these are first world problems, but when paying this much money, you expect all the bells & whistles.
Also, after only having 500 miles on the car, the check engine light came on. At first, the dealer said it was a faulty O2 sensor & could be replaced within minutes. He then told me that sensor had been installed incorrectly and they would need to order a new wire. I was given a 2019 XC60 Rdesign as a loaner (which I liked the acceleration way better than my T5). This was a huge annoyance, especially after only owning the car for less than 2 weeks.
Now what I do love: 1) Smooth & quiet ride; 2) Excellent center display & easy to use technology; 3) Excellent safety features in the lane assist, blind spot monitoring (which go crazy in the car wash); 4) 25 mpg average gas mileage; 5) My favorite feature is the remote start from my phone - I live in Florida & being able to cool my car before I drive is priceless.
Again, overall I love the car, but it isn’t without it’s flaws. Would definitely get another.

volvo,xc60,2019,Tom in Pa., 02/06/2019,The Volvo Priorty!,5,"As previous Volvo owners we won't accept anything less! My wife and I are very fortunate to be able to review this great purchase. A few years back we were involved in head on collision with a large SUV in our S60. Immediately after the accident nearby paramedics rushed over to see what they could do to assist us, only to find my wife and I step away from the Volvo and dust the glass particles from our clothes! So, you see the real value in owning any Volvo is what you don't see that really counts! Volvo has a fantastic way of disguising the safety of their vehicles through the luxury and state of the art technology.  We now proudly own the XC60, besides the interior looks and comfortable seating, the semi-autonomous drive function is one of my favorite features on long road trips.  You can not put a price on safety!
"
volvo,xc60,2019,M. Stott, 01/30/2019,My First Volvo XC60,4,"I was looking for safety features in a small SVU that was stylish with an upscale interior and found it in the Volvo XC60 Inscription.  I was worried it was too big but it is just right.  Their are so many features in this car, I am still tweaking settings to my liking.  The safety features are excellent.  I would have never splurged on vibrating seats, but it was on the one I liked and now I think they are great and use them quite often while driving.  My passengers are pleasantly surprised as well. The only thing I have noticed so far is the electronics response time is slower than my past vehicles which were Lexus.
"
volvo,xc60,2019,MaryM, 04/02/2019,This T6 Inscription is a pleasure to drive!,5,"The upgraded engine is worth the extra cost in my opinion.  The one caveat I have is the fact that air cooled seats are an option. This should be standard for this class and trim level.  The controls for the entertainment/AC/phone have a bit of a learning curve and are not as intuitive as I would like. But this is a minor issue as the car handles like a dream, is easy to maneuver and has excellent view of the road from the driver seat. The 360 camera and other driver assist options also work well and are easy to turn on and off. I am very happy with my purchase!

volvo,xc60,2019,floyd III, 02/11/2019,2nd Home,5,"I love this suv, I bought the Momentum AWD and optioned up,Multimedia package, Leather upholstery brown with power front seat cushion extension and passenger memory.  Lastly i choose and love! the  20"" wheels.  I also requested the optional GPS tracking. This beats my 2017 inscription in so many ways. more safety and much better gas mileage, I'm averaging 24 highway and about 19 city i'd say not bad for AWD. I would recommend this Suv to anyone."
volvo,xc60,2019,Mop, 07/31/2019,Crossing my fingers,4,"I had a tough time deciding between a BMW i3, a Tesla and this Volvo. Living in Wisconsin with a ton of snow in the winter I decided to go for the hybrid AND AWD option just in case. The disappointing part is that I got a check engine light less than 24 hours after getting the car. Not even 50 miles on the odometer. Apparently it was a faulty battery thermostat that had to be changed, which took almost 2 weeks to get it done. No check engine lights after that but it's been only 4 months. So I'm crossing my fingers hoping nothing else happens. Another crazy event was the head up display not working right after fueling but that was just once and resolved on it's own.
The car is great on electric mode and the charge is more than enough to make it to work and back home but I can charge at work if needed. It's nice to be able to forget when it was the last time the car was fueled while having the baseline power to make it through a nasty snowstorm with a foot of snow on the ground. The interior is impeccable, sound is excellent and safety features are a must. 360 degree cameras and parking assistance eventually become second nature and you may miss those when driving something else. Pilot assist has worked as expected during long distance drives of course depending on reliable road markings and weather. It's nice to get used to the quiet ride while on Pure or electric hybrid mode but the engine is loud and angry when kicking in during extreme weather changes. Fans turn on and off all the time while charging which can be annoying but I've had the same strange noises happening while the card is parked on a fuel engine XC90.
If you're thinking about buying a T8, invest in the higher output outlet for faster charging and have realistic expectations regarding electric range factoring in the use of AC/heating and audio. Driving in B mode helps a bit but won't get anything meaningfully recharged. Last thing. Visibility. It's like seeing for the first time and having extra eyes at the right time.
"
volvo,xc60,2019,Sam Dayhood, 04/21/2019,Aviator's Choice,5,"The technology reminds me of a fly by wire aircraft.  From the electronic crystal embedded gear shift to the voice integration and pro pilot assist, this vehicle is loaded with technology and features that make you think you should file a flight plan before taking a road trip.  The plug in hybrid has multiple engine modes but be sure to use the Power mode to warm the 4 cyl turbo before use.  A 240 volt plug in your garage or carport is a must to keep all of your options available.  The daily commute to the office (6 miles round trip) is quiet and smooth in all electric ECO mode.  If Volvo would add a dash button (right side of volume knob) that selects the 360 degree camera that would be the gradde pa moset!
"
volvo,xc60,2019,Jim, 10/26/2019,T8 iXC60 s an awesome but niche car,5,"First off, I’ve seen some allusions to Tesla here and elsewhere, which is ridiculous. This car costs way less than the Model X and has a stated electric range of 17 miles. If you are commuting more than say 30-40 miles a day, this car probably makes no sense. It’s mileage with no charge as a “normal” hybrid is not great, I would say bad even by hybrid standards - and might even be worse than the full gas version if you drive on the highway a lot. 

With that out of the way, for the right person, this is a wondrous technological marvel. The interior is luxurious and I’m getting about 80mpg. I’ve had it for almost a month and have used a third of a tank of gas because my daily commute is about 13 miles round trip. I live in an urban area and my trips rarely exceed the battery range, so for me it’s perfect.

Now, one thing I will emphasize that I didn’t realize at first and I feel is not talked about enough with this car I s the need to “precondition” the climate before leaving. You can do this through the Volvo app or set a timer. It only works when it’s plugged in, but doing so will get the interior climate comfortable, which is nice, but more critically it gets the car’s other components prepped and to the right temp range so you can go straight away in all electric. Otherwise, like on my return trip home (no charger at work), the engine will run for the first few minutes, regardless of charge. 

For me the biggest con is the infotainment and nav system. The infotainment system controls a raft of features, down to surprisingly fine detail in some instances. But that makes it really complex and hard to navigate. It seems needlessly complex in some ways, like audio and other settings existing in two separate menus (somewhat different controls in each) and something as seemingly simple as setting and moving through favorite radio stations is completely unintuitive. I find the nav system confusing and the street labels do not match on occasion on the heads up display, which is an otherwise cool feature. I prefer waze or google maps thru Apple Car Play, even though for some reason it isn’t able to integrate with the heads up display. And the whole system is pretty slow to boot up, as noted by others. On the whole though, I’ve adjusted and it’s a relatively minor gripe.

Other minor gripes: it would be great to have one touch access to the 360 camera like others have noted, and the self-parking mode is cool but doesn’t always work completely right (if you are paying attention at all it’s easy to override it to keep from hitting the curb) and also takes some time to set up. 

I have yet to really test the AWD but so far in rainy conditions I’ve had no traction problems. It’s not uncommon in my area for dealers to push 21 or 22 inch tires on these things and that could make a big negative difference I would think.

I will also note that I see no need to invest in the faster charging. I use the regular plug and it charges overnight. On the weekends I never really drive so much that I need the quick charge either, but I suppose that depends on your personal situation. 

One other thing I will note is the talk about depreciation in some reviews. Well yes, I expect this to have a severe drop upfront. Partly because this is a niche car, really best for those in a more urban environment, and partly because of the $5k tax break that comes with it. Getting that plus model year end pricing allowed me to close much of the the gap with the non-hybrid. Hopefully it holds close to the gas version over time. 

Overall, we have had no complaints at all with this car and could not be more satisfied. I would definitely recommend reading the manual for this if you do purchase. The mileage has been even better than I thought it would be, once I figured out the preconditioning. It is a truly luxurious experience driving in this thing. We upgraded from an
 older Mazda and this is just a totally different experience, to the point we still can’t believe this is our car.

Only going with 4 stars because of mechanical issues. The car is brilliant, beautiful and impressive. 
I love everything about it.,

Problems: Every 5k or so miles the check engine light would come on. Reoccurring issue with some sort of air valve. Took 5 times to get it right but they fixed it.

This is very rare, but the engine blew at 47k. I made it home and then to dealer in a reserved power mode. New engine coming from Volvo now. Good part is I get a new warranty with the engine so....everything is cool.
---------------------------------------
Update 6-17-20 - Other than the check engine light going off around every 6500 miles, the car has been mostly great. I'm now at 37,000 miles. I've only had a few other minor glitches. Luckily I'm covered forever on whatever keeps causing that check engine light to trigger. Not really a big deal. Last time I put black tape to cover the error light....just like I did in my 1980's Dodge Colt. HA!

---------

9500 miles, going in for the 3rd time with a ""Check Engine"" light warning. Is it just my car? Nope! Not according to the service manager who said ""We're seeing this a lot lately"". - Seems to be a poorly designed vacuum hose they just can't seem to fix.....yet.

volvo,xc60,2019,Susan Sutton, 04/24/2019,Mini Electronics problems,1,"Don't buy a new Volvo SUV. There are so many electronics issues, and the dealership has an excuse for all of them.

1.  The phone disconnects from the system after a couple of hours. VOLVO blames this on Apple CarPlay and says they can do nothing about it.

This is after reading about how proud VOLVO is to have Apple CarPlay in their SUV's in 2019. Please don't offer it in your cars if you can't figure out how to get it to sync with the VOLVO computer system.

2.  The radio turns on in the car when the car has been turned off and the keys are in the house and the car is in my garage.  VOLVO says that the car must be locked, in my locked garage - - in order for the car to be completely powered down. 

3.  The radio doesn't consistently turn down when replying to a text. You never know when it's going to work or not work.

4.  With nothing on the passenger car seat, the red light in the instrument panel flashes on and off, indicating that the seatbelt should be turned on. 

So disappointed that I bought this brand new car and have absolutely no recourse.

While the last one was a T6, this time I got a fully loaded T5 and am very happy with the choice -- the difference in power/acceleration is minimal given our driving habits, etc. Love the color (blue denim/maroon brown), and I think that the safety features and technology are fantastic. Love this car so much that a week later I traded our other car, an Acura TLX, for an S60 T6 AWD. Love being a two-Volvo family, first time in our family. And having owned Volvos since 1985 [1985 (740), 1990 (960), 1998 (V70), 2004 (XC70)], I am just very happy with how this brand has evolved.

The battery is ridiculously small, I get less than 20 miles with the battery!  My golf cart does better.  After the battery is dead you basically are running on the 2 liter 4 cylinder engine.  My mileage is running at 21 mpg.   You have to basically recharge/plug the vehicle in everywhere you go.  The ""auto pilot"" adaptive cruise control is actually dangerous.  If the road has any curve to it the car wanders out of its lane.  I won't use it anymore.  Test drive one for a couple of days please before you buy.  I should have and now am sadly disappointed.  If you want a full battery vehicle then perhaps get a Tesla.  You might consider this car in the full gas version but the hybrid is a joke.  As far as autonomous functions Volvo has some work to do, this does not auto pilot like a Tesla that is for sure.

I have has issues since day one. The biggest issue is the random braking for no reason. It has happened to me multiple times, so I sent it back to the dealer for repair. They fixed other things that were wrong (bent rim, warped rotors, bad brake pads -side note, how is there THIS much wrong with a new car?), but they said when they brought it back to me that nothing is wrong with the autobrake feature. Save yourself the frustration and money. Buy a different brand.

The airbag light ""go to dealership immediately"" warning has come on twice and various other weird electrical issues.  The dealership has had to keep my car each time anywhere from 3-16 days!

volvo,xc60,2019,Lowmpg , 12/28/2019,Swedish design at its finest!,5,"There’s not much to dislike about the XC60 T8. There has been no issues with it after having it for nearly a year and putting 12k Kim’s on it. It is a beast of an SUV and the 400hp combined output is transferred well to the road. It isn’t the quietest in its class but the funnest to drive. The combined consumption for the 11k Kim’s driven is 4.2 l/100kms which is absolutely insane for a 2 ton suv. This includes daily work commutes, weekend trips and longer road trips with charging every day when at home. So far there is nothing not to love about the xc60. It handles very well, is balanced, has the most beautiful interior and crushes most of the other SUV’s in its class such as the Lexus’. It is great value and performance for the money.

"
volvo,xc60,2019,Jeffrey T, 08/05/2020,Beautiful Volvo,4,"My wife fell in love with the styling of the newer Volvos and originally wanted the smaller XC40. The XC60 is just much more practical. I, too, fell in love with the design - particularly the LED daytime running lights and great interior so we took the plunge and bought a T5, Momentum. To me, the interior is class-leading and unlike anything I've seen another automaker attempt perhaps except for Tesla. HOWEVER, I will say that function clearly took a backseat to the modern, minimalist interior design . I'm in my 30s and very tech-savvy and I can't imagine anyone over 50 operating this car without a lot of frustration. Essentially all of the controls are operated via the touchscreen interface. I don't personally have an issue with this but Volvo sorely needs to improve the user experience of their infotainment. It can be a lot of swiping and tapping to make even a simple AC adjustment. Plus, it can be slow to boot up when you start the car. The infotainment does have some upsides - crisp graphics, very clear back-up camera, etc. But my other vehicle is a Jeep with Chrysler's excellent UConnect system and it's embarrassing how much more intuitive and responsive Chrysler's system is. The theme of design over function continues really throughout the car. There's little space in the center console because for whatever reason Volvo chose to place both an old-school shifter AND the ignition switch here. I guess they didn't want to mess up their minimalist dashboard design with a push-start or dial/button shifter. These things just become more apparent as you spend time with the vehicle, beautiful as it is. We have the T5 turbo-charged four cylinder and it's perfectly suited for this size vehicle. Getting the T6 would be overkill in my opinion. However, I can't imagine driving the larger XC90 with either engine. I know Volvo is heading toward electrification but a 6 cylinder is badly needed in their line-up. It sounds like I'm beating up on Volvo, I know, but I do honestly love our XC60 despite a few complaints. The exterior styling is elegant but not overdone. The interior is just top quality on every surface you touch. With some improvements in function, I think this SUV would be an absolute home run. "
volvo,xc60,2019,Danielle Larocca, 12/09/2020,So disappointed with this car,1,"It is pretty to look at but sometimes the system does not boot up when you turn on the car so for 15 minutes or so while driving there is no heat/ac or radio, the display screen only works for android when your phone is physically plugged in to the car, the voice response is a joke no matter what you say the response is always the same.  I would give anything to get out of my lease and get back to a BMW or Mercedes.

I couldn't be happier with mine.
A couple car pool trips shy of 200,000 miles (I bought it new) and no major issues - never a tranny, motor, A/C or electrical problem.
I get about 45,000 miles on tires - not great but a willing compromise knowing I'm driving a stout porker that's as safe as anything on the road.
I have an honest, reliable mechanic who has taken care of a couple cars for me - a bonus.
Other than scheduled maintenance items, there hasn't been much to repair on the car that would not be expected, given the mileage.
Ball joints and motor mounts are the only things that come to mind"
volvo,xc90,2003,marigold1, 03/09/2012,What Volvo is not telling you about this car.,2,"I would stay far away from buying another Volvo after everything my family has been through with our 2003 XC90. The engines are not built to work with the transmissions. We have replaced the transmission every 30,000 miles. It has now become a safety issue. It has broken down on me too many times to count. I have dumped almost $12,000 into it. Go look at the service center at your local Volvo dealership. The lot is full of cars needing repairs. We have replaced the transmission 3 times, radiator, shocks, struts, axles, arm bushings...even down to the door handles. Do not make the same mistake we did. It is not a reliable car and I consider it a safety risk to drive."
volvo,xc90,2003,Stephen J. Lalor, 01/02/2007,15 + Years A Volvo Owner - No More !!,2,"Was true Volvo believer here for over 15 years but no more! I have always loved this brand and believed in  but the XC 90 is the most unreliable, high maintenance auto I have ever owned. 60 k miles now, and am in need of (4th set of 4 tires)and front-end ball joints; heating and air conditioning system has never worked correctly (and they can't figure it out), passenger side front window has broken at least 4 times; wind shield wiper blades fly off car.... shall I continue?   I just purchased a different brand SUV even though I have 3 months to go on my Volvo-KLUNKER lease!  2007 Buyers - beware and consider alternative, less expensive SUVs unless you enjoy visiting dealer service facilities."
volvo,xc90,2003,dok, 09/11/2010,What a nightmare!!!,3,"I have finally solved all of my 2003 XC90 problems,  I GOT RID OF IT!  Let me count the thousands of dollars I spent in 7 years on maintenance, 4 sets of tires, 2 were the crappy pirelli's, then 1 set of michellins and finally 1 set of goodyear assurance tires rated for 80,000 miles. A leaky power steering unit, both front lower ball joints and tie rod ends.  And a new transmission after 57000 miles along with a leaky sun roof and the emissions evporative pump and charcoal canister. but what realy hurts IS not being able to find a volvo dealer that could fix the car reliably and honestly. steer clear of volvo of edison's  service department."
volvo,xc90,2003,hpark, 02/25/2007,First Year XC90...Gremlins,3,Bought the T6 as a certified used car from a local dealership in 2004 with 24K on it...thank goodness for warranty as this vehicle was in the shop too often..during our first year of ownership approx 4 visits and about 1.5 months of non-use as they finally determined the engine block was cracked which caused a perpetual coolant bleed into the cylinders...plus since then sunroof drain blockage caused water to leak into the vehicle and soak all of the electrical in front.  Tires burn through in about 20k miles and a window switch that sank into the door panel.  Guess this is part of the First year gremlins that came out...long story short...I think the Japanese earned their quality reputation.

The transmission gave out and had to be replaced, a piston gave out it was replaced, dashboard lights out , brake lights were out and the mechanic could not find the short so the wiring was replaced but the dash warning came on every time you step on the brakes.

fun to drive after moving from a 
Chrylser Town and County.  Less room, 
but great handling.

One complaint is the way the key/remote 
control lock is designed.  The key 
attaches to one's keyring via a small 
metal connector that is not permanently 
attached to the remote control device.  
Twice, I have almost lost my key when 
my key ring and the metal connector 
have separated.  Volvo should design a 
higher quality connector, one that is 
integral to the remote control device 
itself, not something that connects to 
it and then to your key ring. "
volvo,xc90,2003,Sad volvo owner, 11/22/2006,Frequent Service,3,"Second volvo to own.  Other was turbo S80.  Both required frequent servicing.  The S80 become costly after the warranty period.  I was happy that I did not purchase the extended warranty because most of the problems were not covered or I used up the time before reaching the mileage.   We are now located in Houston and recently their service is not user friendly.  At least in St. Louis, the service was user friendly.  Frequent service but user friendly.  Service problems in this XC90 included the transmission needing replacement, the Turbo needing service and then multiple small electronic issues.  I guess the Swedes haven't mastered computers yet. With only 28K, looking for a new vehicle!"
volvo,xc90,2003,phred3717, 07/14/2011,Never Again,1,"I will never buy another Volvo.

This car cost me countless hours and huge sums of money to keep running.

I had an extended waranty to begin with but then the real problems began.
Brake pads annually, main engine seals, tierod ends, transmission.

Broke down on family trips even after being serviced faithfully by dealer!

Last straw - the turbos blew on a road trip 1,000 Km from home with family and friends onboard.
Got $100 for it and was happy to see the end of it.

Fool me once shame on you Volvo
- wont happen again."
volvo,xc90,2003,Tom, 07/07/2010,Worst Car I Ever Owned,2,"This was my first and will be my last Volvo.  This thing needs new tires every 20,000 miles, grinds through brake pads, needed a new transmission at 80,000 miles and now at 100,000 miles the turbo is blown.  Probably had this car in the shop 2 to 3x per year for various electrical and mechanical problems.  Volvo was gracious enough to replace the transmission for only the cost of labor (I am convinced they have a silent recall going on) but it still cost me $1,600.  Now to fix the turbo will cost another $5,000.  It is time to trade in this albatross....I should have done it 30,000 miles ago.  Volvo should just recall this vehicle and give everybody their money back."

We liked the design of the Volvo XC90, but after we bought it.....
 Let's see:
30k miles, the ENTIRE front end had to be replaced (after about 4 shots by the dealer to fix it).
At 80k miles, Transmission failed.
Wow!
$5,000 for a transmission!!


Around 110k miles, the CD changer and radio stopped working.
Would come on and go off randomly; sometimes staying on after the car was turned off.
The roof liner on both sides of the windhshield came off.

There is a noticeable squealing 
whenever I back off the accelerator. 
The problem (thought to be 
turbocharger back-pressure) is 
currently ""under investigation"" by 
Volvo. The windshield washers are 
loose and turn on their own. Not the 
kind of build quality you would expect 
on a $40K+ car. Fuel economy on the T6 
is awful. In summary, there are no 
major problems but this is not what I 
expected for $43K. Do not overlook the 
T5 version as it is nearly as fast as 
the T6 with smoother performance due 
to the 5 speed transmission.  It also 
has much better fuel economy. If I had 
it to do over again, I would have 
bought the T5."

We had the car towed in 3 times for electrical problems before they found the problem and at the same time it was leaking.  We had seen leaking around the sun roof but the car was flooding into the passenger floor - which was blamed on the sunroof drain.  Again, we took it in 3 times - were accused of parking it outside! and even dumping a bucket of water in it.  We paid over $1500 dollars to clean up the mess and Volvo refused to cover it under warranty.  Our car was either dead or in the shop for 42 days out of the past 2 months.

The vehicle absolutely cannot hold an alignment (we get it realigned every 3-6K miles) and burns thru tires rapidly (every 10-12K miles).  Every time we have something fixed, a new problem emerges within 500 miles of driving.  Lots of stuff (rear shocks, bearings, brake pads) have had to be replaced prematurely, and there have been many minor problems (stench from HVAC, radio malfunctions, etc.) on top of more serious concerns."

After multiple trips to the Volvo dealership for engine light issues, door seal leaks, transmission seal leaks, brake master cylinder leak/failure, and several other small engine repairs. We've deemed the check engine light the ""$1000 light"", because every time it comes on or we make a trip to the dealership for repairs it costs at least $1000. Great idea for Volvo's first SUV, but plagued with problems. Later years don't seem to be much better.  Fun to drive, looks great, way too expensive to maintain and repair! "

The third set was Michelins but they aren't up to the task either. For my next set of tires I'm going to try the GoodYear Assurance ComforTred tires. It took the service department about 3 years to finally fix the leak in my power steering. And the funny noise the front end suspension made every time I made a right turn.

standard features seen in only a few, if any, 
of its competitors.  The 6 cylinder engine is a 
must without which the car would be 
sluggish.  "

better than T6 (too squishy on accel). 
Safety is priority, XC90 is tops.

comfortable seating, better passenger

dash layout. Step bar/running board 
useless, though. Too hard to step over

especially in winter. Better off with 
aftermarket step.

the new Volvo SUV was that an otherwise

in to the demand of these unsafe, 
irresponsible, environmentally 
wreckless, overall nast vehicles.  
Well, I was wrong about this one!  This 
car has all the great SUV attributes 
without the nastiness I've mentioned 
above.  The exterior/interior design is 
better then anyone else, and looks 
every bit as good as the BMW X5.  The 
interior is different, but in a quite 
revolutionary way.  Best of all, it 
drives and rides incredibly well."

performance for an SUV and near car

highway speeds while the 2.5T is like a 
rocket ship off the line. At about 
30mph the T6 dominates and runs away,

absolutley amazing.  There was no 
rolling or swaying of the SUV at all.  
My other SUV swayed so much in an

out interior design i've seen... 
extremely user friendly. handles great 
(for an suv) and love telling my suv-

chevy pick-up that had been stopped 
behind me.  That truck was rear ended 
by a dodge daytona that was going 35-
40 mph without braking. The daytona 
was scrunched up like an accordian, 
the chevy was damaged enough to be 
totalled, my xc-90 did what it was 
supposed to do, it took the impact and 
deflected  the force downward. The 
whiplash system helped me a ton.  My 
damage was bacically to the lower area 
and lower liftgate. $2000 damage and 
being put out, but I cannot 
overemphasize my impressment of the 
safety of this unit!!"
volvo,xc90,2003,kentmilani, 06/12/2003,My first SUV,4,"We were looking for a safe 7 seat 
vehicle, comfortable seats, reliable 
and economical to run.  The MDX is only 
the only other SUV to come close to 
this descripition.

The fuel economy (or lack thereof) has 
surprised me in the first 800 miles.  
My Toyota Tundra V8 does better in city 
and on highway.  I have BABIED the 
XC90's throttle and I get 14 mpg (US 
gallons)in the city and 20 mpg on 
highway.  Tell me it's just during the 
break-in period?!

Dealer tried a few ""tricks"" when I went 
to pick it up, but they backed down 
when I objected.

sluggishness follwed by a dashboard 
message ""Urgent Transmission Service 
Required.""  The dealer had the car for 
4 days, and flew in a Volvo master 
tech to fix the problem - bad solenoid 
that locks in gears.  Dealership never 
heard of problem, but one of the 
salesman heard that it had happened in 
a handful of other XC90's with low 
mileage.  Aside from this early 
problem, we love the stylish exterior, 
the comfy interior, the practical 
seating, the decent soundsystem."

it's great.  Love the way it handles - 
it's zippy!  Had a Jeep Grand Cherokee 
before and it was a chore to drive.  
The XC90 is fun.  Lots of room, seats

15 mpg and the hesitation when you 
accelorate at low speeds are negatives."

This car feels light and nimble, but 
has variable performance. Sometimes 
there is a lag between 1st and 2nd 
gears.  Braking is excellent.  Ride 
and handling are very good.  Engine is 
quiet.  Gas mileage and range is 
poor.  The car is well-engineered for 
versatility.  Second row seating 
adjusts individually for all 3 seats.  
Center seat slides all the way 
forward.  Third row is two independent 
seats which fold into the third row.

the following: overall build quality,

control, poor audio system (the premium 
Dolby Pro-logic II surround sound is 
very disappointing), and, most 
disappointing, the lack of adequate

Further, it is poorly configured for a 
shorter person...breaks in the wrong 
places and is unforgiving.  
Additionally, the headrest does not 
adjust.  Small foot well(no room for 
purse and sit straight).
Dual air conditioning is usual in many 
car of this price range.  Navigation 
hard to use and hard to see v. in dash

very comfortable ride and excellent

complex vehicle.  Gas mileage has been

the XC90 has a few weak spots.  There is
a blind spot on both the driver and
passenger sides which block peripheral
vision in a very disruptive and
dangerous way.  A surprise for Volvo who
appears concerned with safety.  No other
severe blind spots, but extreme caution
must be taken to overcome this.

After the first service at 7500, we
completed MANY warranty repair issues. 
Yikes.  Some minor, but one major issue
with brakes.  Days after this service,
the check engine light appeared.  The
service dept at our local dealer was so

I don't like that the rear gate doesn't

or that the rear window doesn't open, 
as it did on our old Mountianeer, but

the way both vehicles perform. The 
quality in the craftsmanship between the

In April I gave the car to my college-aged nephew and bought a 2005 XC90 T6 for myself. My new SUV now has 8000 miles and has only surpassed my expectations in function and handling. Some drivers/reviewers have dissed the programming commands on Volvo's audio and navigation systems. I don't know what they are talking about, but I'd tell them this: Practice makes perfect. Once mastered both systems are easy to operate, and operate like a dream. The navigation system, AKA ""Inga,"" is so handy and reliable I now can't imagine driving without it.

car to the market and its arrival has
exceeded my expectations.  Living in the
Northeast, your faced with fluctuating
road conditions, be it due to weather or
just the type of road.  This car
performs great all around.  No SUV or
any automobile for that matter can stop
on a sheet of ice, so with the Volvo,
you can be assured you are safe should
you get into trouble.  The interior is
comfortable, and I think on the outside,
is the best looking SUV on the road. 
Lastly, the Volvo XC90 is very spacious
and has an optional third seat that and
adult will not be cramped in.  It is a
fantastic car!"
volvo,xc90,2003,RoJo, 08/22/2004,Volvo XC90 -- 2003,4,"Toss up between the X5 and XC90--we 
choose the XC90.  Although we're happy 
with the vehicle overall, the gas 
mileage, acceleration, audio system and 
navigator system need Volvo's 
attention.  Overall the vehicle gets 
high marks for style 
(interior/exterior), craftsmanship, 
comfront and maintenance.    "

into the ultimate SUV and you get the XC90 T6, 
Contrary to the media's view, I drove both the 5 and 
6 and found the 5 to be very buzzy and 
underpowered, especially at passing speeds.  The 
ride of this vehicle is better than many cars. I own a 
2004 Passat GLX (top of the line) and I find the 
handling of the Volvo SUV better.  We also looked at 
the BMW X5 3.0, MB ML320, and Acura MDX.. butI I 
highly recommend this vehicle.  "
volvo,xc90,2003,Mike McNutt, 01/16/2005,36K Miles,4,"Ours is fully equipped with everything. We driven it 36K miles and really like the car. We have taken 3500 mile trips, and two over 2000 miles. I like the car as a daily driver as well. We have had trouble with the brakes, light coming on and the power assist, was in five times for the problem, but never a safety issue, just a nuisance. Avg. 20-22 mpg on hwy, 14-17 in town. The best 26mpg. Plenty of power for everything except drag racing."

study of SUVs, the XC90 was chosen, 
mainly for its extra safety features. 
If you have children, that in itself, 
is worth the price.It is stronger then

Using high test gas today makes it even more  expensive.  The car eats tires--OEM got 14,000.  2nd pair of Michelins got 20,000. But it is secure, safe and comfortable.

volvo,xc90,2003,Hacky, 03/23/2003,The best SUV!,4,"The SUV that handles like a car. IMO a
better ride than that of the MDX.
The XC90 is the best combination of
space, safety and practicality. If you
need the huge space of a minivan, you
should get a minivan. However, minivans
do not provide the sense, real or
imagined, of security that one gets
driving the XC90. 

The third row fold-away seats are
awesome, designed to be safe for kids,
big enough for smaller adults on shorter
trips. Better design than the Lexus 3rd
row. 

With the 5-speed tranny this engine is
smooth and it feels much bigger than it
is. Better for stop and go driving than
the T6 with the 4-speed tranny. That
being said, a few more horsies wouldn't
hurt."

I have replaced just about everything in my XC90. At 80,000 miles expect to purchase a new transmission. I have already replaced my manifold, radiator-  twice, brakes (twice a year) and tires annually (thanks to the awd-at least that's what i've been told).  The only thing I haven't replaced is the steering wheel- at least not yet! And my T6 is dangerously slow!"

We looked for a month and decided the 
XC90 was a perfect candidate...large, 
but not huge, safe for our kids with 
great styling and utility. Drove a 
demo and fell in love. Then the hunt 
was on. Took us a couple of weeks to 
get the word out to all dealers in the

that was sold fell through. We drove 
up the next morning (200 miles) and 
picked it up. My wife calls me during

vehicle. The XC-90 is very comfortable
and feels solid. Overall we are very 
happy with the vehicle. It has average 
accleration, but is extremely potent 
when asked to do a high speed pass.  
I've noticed that the 4-speed 
automatic does not shift as seamlessly 
as I would expect for a premium 
vehicle.I've also noticed a minor 
design flaw with the seat belts in the 
second row.  The belt will catch on 
the release latch to the third row  
and turn perpendicular to the door 
panel, and since there is not enough 
clearance, if you do not reposition it 
manually it will gouge the door panel 
and cut the seat."

OK. Guess what, same problem happened again 8 times for the next 18 months, everytime had the car towed and all the inconveniences. Had the car for only 18 months and have already replaced tires, steering rod and lots of other things. Had it serviced for 30,000 miles and cost was $1,100. Overall city mileage was 11 mpg, highway about 16. With premium gas prices at $3.30/gal, this car is more expensive than sending a child to college."

a similar vehicle from my local 
dealer.  The interior is beautiful, 
the T5 engine is plenty, and the ride 
quality is terrific and quiet.  BMW X% 
was $6000 more and had 1/2 the 
equipment and lousy base stereo with 
single CD.  The BMW has a choppy ride 
as well.  Very trucklike, unlike the 
XC90.  Great job Volvo..."

Sweden.  It was a great experience to 
visit the factory and pick the car up 
at the location it was built.  The 
factory tour was impressive.  They 
were making mostly XC 90s, so we could 
see every stage of XC 90s being 
built.  At the end of the day, we 
drove to the ferry.  The next day, 
driving through 
Germany, the drive was great.  The 
factory representative told us to take 
it easy, keep it under 4000 RPM.  He 
estimated that would be about 85 MPH.  
He was wrong, with the T6, I was going 
100 MPH before I new it at about 3000 
RPM!  It is truly a great ride."
volvo,xc90,2003,madwood, 04/22/2003,Better Than The S60,4,"I drove the S-60 for the past two 
years, and how it handled the road.  
Only problem was no room for three 
kids in the back.  The XC-90 takes 
care of that, and more.  It handles 
very similar to the S-60, has a ton 
more room, and is more fun to drive (I 
can still zip around town & between 
slow traffic).  The highway ride is 
considerably better, and quieter, than 
the S-60.  I do have the 18"" wheels, 
and had 17"" on the S-60.  My wife has 
a 2001 Suburban - loaded.  She wants 
my XC-90, but I won't let her have 
it.  I'm moving car seats when the

uses.  With the T6 we were pleasantly 
surprised how well made it is and 
how ""smart"" the vehicle actually is.  
The anti roll, reverse warning, climate

surpassed our expectations and made 
this not a typical suv."

volvo,xc90,2004,10162001, 07/17/2015,Updated review - 7/2016,5,"**Update at the end of review**
I bought this 2.5T Front Wheel Drive Volvo as a pre-owned, non warranty vehicle form an independent car lot  in 2006. I had never owned a preowned vehicle before, I always bought/leased new cars before. But when I stumbled upon this car I fell in love and was willing to take a chance.  Nine years on I am still in love with this car.  It has not been without the odd issue:
- when I first had it, the driver side headlight would randomly go out. I took it to a few garages and they didn't have a clue.  I found an independent garage opened by a Volvo Certified Master Tech and he sorted it out right away (nearest Volvo dealership is over 2 hours from me)

- the radio died in 2011 (it was 7 years old) but I was able to replace it with one found from a salvaged xc90 in 2012 and saved a lot of money by waiting for a salvaged radio vs. a new replacement ($80 + installation)

- In 2014 (at 10 years old) we knew that there were some significant bits that needed to be replaced simply due to wear and tear - belts, water pump, blower fan was starting to go and the starter needed replacing. Thought about selling it but we had a rash of bad luck with BMWs and even a Porshe Cayman.  My XC90 was still running great and the estimate to get all of the worn out pieces replaced was far far cheaper than getting another car. We even bought some new floor mats - no one believes this car is 11 years old. It rides and looks like a much newer car. 

So here I am, 9 years after I bought it and still love it.  The driver's seat is getting a bit worn but the rest of the car is still in amazing shape. The fabric on the roof has a bit of a droop in a place behind the backseat light and the weatherstripping is a bit worse for wear but these are all cosmetic. Mechanically it drives as beautifully as the day I bought it.  Next year I'm probably going to look at getting a pre-owned XC60 or maybe another XC90 but I'm keeping this 2004 for my daughter.   She doesn't start driving for another few years but I have full faith that this car has many more years left. And I'll feel a lot safer with her in the XC90.

*Update:
Edmunds asked me to update my review; I've now owned the car ten years and I'm still happy.  All is well apart from the 6 disk CD changer; it's gone on the fritz and will only play disks inserted into slot 3.  But meh...it was an $80 replacement from a salvaged XC90. We have a Volvo iPod adapter and rarely use the CD player anyway.   I know in my old review I stated I would probably replace this car this year with a newer model but it's just not on my agenda at the moment. Maybe next year... ;)

My wife does not like large vehicles and the XC90 has been an easy adjustment for her, It drives more like a car than truck or big SUV. The pros of the XC90 are a good ride, good handling, and a comfortable interior. The cons of this vehicle are poor fuel economy (16mpg city 21mpg hwy) combined with a small gas tank.

volvo,xc90,2004,bob458, 11/04/2011,Too many problems dont buy,2,"Bought a used xc90 from volvo. We have averaged a new problem every 2000 miles. Including a breakdown leaving my pregnant wife stranded and now flickering headlights that cant be fixed despite visits to the dealership and throwing money at it. (computers and modules are next on the list) It would be nice if the dealership looked like they knew how to fix what is apparantly a common problem on their vehicles...

 So its going to be traded in with a 6 mth loss of 5-6k. Looks pretty but its not engineered well nor built well - certainly not the volvos of old. "

I have never kept a car this long, but I never want to get rid of it! I have taken really good care of this car and kept up all the maintenance, so maybe if you don't that's where the problems come in that other people are having. "
volvo,xc90,2004,scottque, 07/01/2014,Expensive All-Weather Hauler,3,"Have had this thing now for 10+ years and 90,000 miles.
Went from primary car for hauling two kids to a third car that sits outside and is reserved for ""dirty work"".
Have been lucky enough to avoid any engine and transmission problems but the cost of multiple failed wheel bearings, sway bars, and ignition coils have really mounted - especially for a relatively low-mileage vehicle.
Still, the fact that we still have this car says a lot about it. It is extremely versatile, in terms of hauling people and stuff.
It has always started and never broken down.
And one thing about the Swedes - they know how to make safe cars that can drive through snow!
Ten years old and does not look dated."

At 78,000 miles I replaced 5 ignition coils for a total of $345.00 in just parts no labor, Upper engine mount repair for $579.00.

Turns out we were wrong. At 130k the transmission started slipping and we traded it in on a new car. During the 40k miles we owned it we also had to replace the rear bearings and the front drivers side drive shaft. We also put a new headliner in. When it was running it was a great riding car.

The ride is smooth and the 5 cylinder engine is responsive enough for all my needs.  On the reliability side, I believe Ford took several cost savings measures and put cheap parts into a high end vehicle. e.g. headlamp cover pitting, rear wheel bearing wear, lug nuts rusting, and electronics problems.  Very aggravating..   My 2nd vehicle (Honda Element)is more reliable at 1/2 the price"

The Toyota always felt like work, while the Volvo feels like home.
You sit on most seats, but sit in these.
Will it easily do 120mph?
Without admitting to anything, I'd have to say yes. The 5cyl turbo is the way to go, as this engine/trans combo seem to be bullet-proof. I test drove this and the Honda Pilot, and am glad our family of six is moving in the Volvo."

The headlight covers are pitted and dis colored.  The wheel nuts had to be replaced twice.  The first time for rust the second time for wear???? The very last repair and most upsetting was for a new infotainment module.  The problem began when the radio began looking like a disco. The lights began flashing and periodically the radio would shut off and the display would go blank.  I can live without the radio, but when this problem corrupted the Air bag system to the point it might not work, I had to have it fixed at a cost of$1350.00 Volvo would do nothing"

Steering makes a loud clunk when turning at low speeds. Several trim pieces have consistently fallen off. The leather on the driver's seat is starting to crack despite multiple conditioning. Gas mileage is about 15.6-16.2 according to the computer. And yes, the upgraded 18 inch wheels did not have the upgraded brakes not where the tires provided of any quality.

We love this vehicle inside and outside.  If your looking to purchase the ""T6"" model you need to look into the service records of the Transmission.   The 2.9liter twin turbocharged 6 cylinder has a lot of torque and horsepower.  The weight of the vehicle with that power puts a lot of stress on the transmission.   So I'd check to see if the ATF was serviced at a ""Volvo Dealership"" every 25,000 miles.  I would check to see if the transmission had any repairs or if it was ever replaced.   Also the front/rear differential oil should be serviced immediately as preventive  maintenance,  the diff's are often overlooked.  Any turbocharged engine should get frequent oil changes to assist with cooling of the actual turbocharger."

The dealer (Large Volvo dealer in Wilkes-Barre) attempted to repair the problem 3 times without success. When this occurred the fourth time I began looking into the Lemon Law.

noise are almost non-existant. We took 
it cross country from Louisiana to 
Washington State (2700 miles)loaded.  
It got a flat 20 mpg fighting a head 
wind and 93 degree temp. with the AC 
fully engaged across the State of 
Texas.  In Colorado it saw mountain 
passes at 11,000 feet in elevation. The

volvo,xc90,2004,Elizabeth, 07/21/2008,Volvo XC 90 T6 Turbo AWD Fantastic!,4,"I purchased my Volvo XC90 4 years ago, and I'm very happy with my decision. For a large SUV, this one drives smoothly - not like a truck. It's very easy to handle. The steering/turning radius is incredible; it turns on a dime. Contrary to a couple of the reviews here, my experience with the acceleration is very positive. I find that there's no lag time between braking and resuming driving. In fact, when the light turns green, my XC90 gets the jump on cars beside me (and I don't floor it). Although I have the third row, I mostly keep it down; my family is able to take long trips with seemingly no end to the cargo space. While no gas-saver, I get around 19 city and 23 highway."
volvo,xc90,2004,chriswhiston, 10/30/2008,Here's a little history,2,"I should have seen the sign. When I went to buy the car back in 2004, I had picked out the exact model I wanted, then while I was filling out paperwork, I was notified one of the doors did not open. After another Identical model was found, I took it home. 8500 miles later it needed brakes. Seats showed wear at 10000 miles. Then soon after, the passenger door started popping open. There have been numerous leaks, including a cracked power steering reservoir. Many noises started popping up, a transmission leak appeared, the Volvo dealership rarely fixed problems the first time. Now, because of this, at 47000 miles, the car is in need of a new transmission. Volvo now must replace the radiator."
volvo,xc90,2004,carnut, 12/27/2008,Smooth cruiser,4,This is our 6th Volvo. Smooth and comfortable on the highway. We keep up with the maintenance and have the transmission fluid flushed annually. Best mileage was 23.4 mpg on the highway with premium 93. Most filling stations add 10% ethanol now which has lowered our fuel economy averages. 
volvo,xc90,2004,TAK, 01/22/2009,Volvo XC 90 T6 Still Loving It,4,"We bought  this car new. This has been my favorite car to drive. We bought it because it had all the safety features that we wanted which were ahead of it's time, it's nice size, and it's towing capacity. Despite the practical reasons for buying this car, it is fun! The power is incredible. It has phenomenal acceleration even at high speeds on the highway.  It is usually no contest, even against other sport sedans. I have had this car for five years and 80,000 miles.  It is the only car that I have loved for more than a couple years, and it is just as fun as the day we bought it. "
volvo,xc90,2004,Davey60, 01/27/2008,Good Vehicle,4,Bought this as a CPO after my Highlander was totaled - was looking for a little bigger SUV.  I am not disapointed.  Did lots a research on the SUV and knew enough to stay away from the T6 with its trannsmission problems.
volvo,xc90,2004,bp, 10/23/2009,Transmission exploded after one month,3,"Do not buy this year xc90 under ANY circumstances. Had it one and a half months, transmission exploded. Car has low miles (45,000) and I bought the aftermarket warranty. They will not cover the loss due to a clip failure in the transmission, which fails due to a too short lube tube from the pan. Thumbs way down. "
volvo,xc90,2004,doug, 01/29/2010,i must have gotten the good one,4,"we have put all but 23 miles on this vehicle and are not unhappy.  5 cylinder is a bit noisy on hard acceleration but we change the oil when due, put gas in the tank and drive.  still has original battery, did do the 105000 maintenance. at 70000 put front break pads on.  just put the 3rd set of tires on last august this vehicle can carry a lot of stuff.  the back seats are rather flat so no comfortable for long trips however like ivory soap, only two of us ride in the think 99.44%of the time. we can get 2 bicycles in but it is a hassle so they go on top. only if i go by myself do a bike go inside.  expect to drive at least another 100000 miles before retiring"
volvo,xc90,2004,Jen, 02/02/2010,NEVER will we buy a Volvo again..,3,"I am the original owner of this car.  We paid MSRP (I know, I know).  The car is loaded and was fabulous for about a year.  We have had to replace all four tires 4 times, brakes 4 times, transmission, rear bearings.. engine problems, key fob problems, seat belt problem, water leaking...  You name it, we've had it.  The ONLY thing we did right was buy the extended warranty. Has saved us $10k, easily."
volvo,xc90,2004,NavyMom, 02/23/2010,I loved that car...,3,"Overall I had an excellent experience with my Volvo XC90.  I had some of the same issues in that I had to replace the brake pads and tires frequently, but I do mostly city driving with a lot of stop and go.  I had no major problems until December of 2009.  The check engine light went on.  It was time for the 60,000 mile tune-up and when they changed the spark plugs and coil, everything was fine for about 2 weeks. Then the engine light came back on.  It took an overnight stay and a cold start for them to find the issue;a cracked gasket head!!  There had been no warning signs, no running it hot, nothing!  The repair cost of $6000 made me decide to trade it for the new XC60 T6 AWD. I miss it :("
volvo,xc90,2004,DomandKim, 07/10/2010,Never again will I buy a Volvo! Hate it!,2,"I hate this car! Bought new, all options but the GPS, over $50K. At 200 miles needed a new fuel tank, original was cracked. Here's what went wrong: Xenon headlight fogged replaced, almost killed myself because they were pointing down, night visibility after reinstall of the new ones was 10 feet! Then the tail lights leaked filled with water, replaced, power steering unit, replaced, computer replaced, fuel tank door fell off 2X's, windshield wipers broke, CD player and back-up signal beeper stopped working, brakes after 20K miles, tires every 22K miles, water filled the roof, wanted $900 to remove interior to let it ""dry out""!

The seats are so comfy, and the steering wheel just feels like silk! But then the transmission issue. Do not buy a t6 awd unless it has had the transmission upgrade! I bought one used now I'm looking at $8,000.00 in repairs. Volvo knows it's a huge prob and will pay for parts in some cases. "
volvo,xc90,2004,bballnut, 07/11/2003,Best in class,4,"Exceeded my expectations. Fun to drive 
and performs well in bad weather. 
Pulls the PWCs out of water without 
slipping on the ramp. Center section 
of  rear seat folds to keep two kids 
separated and provides a place to set 
the Playstation 2 for playing games 
and watching DVDs. Also a great place 
to put the water skis. Fold flat 3rd 
row seats provide ample storage space 
for dog cage and luggage."
volvo,xc90,2004,swan23, 07/20/2003,One Bad Hombre,4,"This is the SUV for folks who hate 
SUV's. More like a station wagon on 
steroids. The most well thought-out car 
in years, every detail considered down 
the center arm rest which fold back to 
hold a sandwhich for the driver. The 
brakes a smooth as butter, better than 
my A6, the engine shifts smoother than 
any car I have ever owned and the only 
negative I can find is reduced 
visibility over the left shoulder due 
to the reinforced pillar which was a 
trade off for increased roof strength 
which I would trade anyway. The only 
car that comes close in price is the 
Touareg and the rear seat in that is 
claustrophic."
volvo,xc90,2004,VonKod, 07/19/2003,Great with a few issues...,4,"This is one of the best SUVs I have 
owned, however I do have a few concerns:

Interior - the wood inlays look and 
feel extremely cheap (think plastic).  
Additionally, the brushed 
aluminum/chrome interior door handles 
look extremely cheap.  Volvo needs to 
take style types from BMW on wood 
inlays!

Gas Mileage - much worse than 
advertised.  Expect 10-13 MPH only."

volvo,xc90,2004,avonpan, 12/07/2003,Safety First,5,"My husband and I chose the XC90 for its 
safety features(whiplash protection, 
rollover protection, airbags galore 
even curtains to protect from glass).  
We were in a rollover (3+ times) 
accident in a different SUV;it was 
totalled and we were too.  Both of us 
were paranoid of being hit by an out of 
control driver again and wanted the 
BEST protection.  Volvo beats the 
others hands down.  My husband was 
reluctant to even test drive one 
because Volvo conjures up images 
of ""boring boxy ugly"" car.  However, 
after the test drive, we were convinced 
that its combination of looks, safety 
and performance beat the Mercedes, 
Acura and BMW.  "
volvo,xc90,2004,John, 08/05/2006,Volvo XC90 Review,4,My Volvo XC90 defiantly rides smooth and quiet. The only complaint about the whole car is the pickup speed and acceleration. It is jerky sometimes when you go to accelerate. Other than that everything else makes up for that one flaw. 
volvo,xc90,2004,From NY to LA, 10/09/2004,Don't buy a car in its first model year,3,"The XC90 had reliability issues from 
the start, that the dealership tried to 
dismiss. Of most importance, the hatch 
was so loose that it closed on my head! 
And, when I went to the ER the 
admitting physician said the same thing 
happened to his wife (same exact model-
T6). When Volvo was contacted, they 
dismissed it. Two weeks letter, 
received a ""campaign letter"" including 
to fix the hatch. Recently the front 
seat reclined by itself on to my son's 
legs (who was sitting in his car seat). 
This happened three times. Because of 
these things and that it's fuel economy 
is lousy, I wouldn't recommend the 
Volvo XC90 T6."
volvo,xc90,2004,7milehi, 08/26/2006,It's always something,4,"Built like a tank, fun to drive, solid feel and loaded with safety features.

volvo,xc90,2004,J Knowles, 10/14/2006,Happy CX90 Owner,4,"As my first experience owning an SUV, I was worried about handling the size. This Volvo XC90 has been wonderful. The narrower build makes the vehicle handle more like a car. At the same time, the three rows of seating have given our family of five all the comfort and convenience we wanted. We highly recommend the vehicle. "
volvo,xc90,2004,Susan, 11/11/2006,xc90 still a good bet after 2 yr,4,"This is my first Volvo and it has not disappointed.  It was purchased for overall safety reasons, and it has been very reliable in the 2 years that I have had it.  It is a pleasure to drive.  The only problem with performance is the get up and go.  It is a little sluggish. The vehicle doesn't get too bad gas mileage.   I have been getting 19 mpg in the city and 22-23 on the highway.  "
volvo,xc90,2004,sopsylisa, 06/08/2003,great with a few exceptions,4,"I've had my AWD 2.5T with prem, 
clim, and vers packages for 3wks now. 
It drives great, and the mileage has 
been good (about 20mpg overall).    
  I like the split tailgate and that 
the third row seats fold flat.
  The handling in curves is amazing.
  My only major gripe is the poor 
visibility. The small rear window and 
wide A,B,C, and D pillars make seeing 
what's around you very difficult. With 
both third row seats up, the head rests 
hinder visibility even further. 
  Annoying small stuff for a 40k 
vehicle:
  The 2.5T is a little underpowered 
when it comes to accelerating from a 
stop.
  Roof rack crossbars aren't standard."
volvo,xc90,2004,Kelley Gordon, 05/28/2008,XC90,3,"I feel weight off my shoulders- I sold my Volvo last weekend for a Subaru Outback. In spite of poor SUV value it was relief to be rid of the constant maintenance. I bought it as a new mom hoping for the reliabilty and safety Volvo is known for--instead I spent literally every week at Volvo servicing another check engine light, gasket loose, a power source issue, a low voltage warning...you name it. I spent more time arranging childcare for my trips to the dealership than I did driving my children in it. It makes me so angry because I worked hard saving to buy this ""high quality"" vehicle for my family. I wish Volvo understood or cared how diappointed I am. "

It went something like this: ""You gotta come see this car in the showroom.  Not sure what it is but it's BEAUTIFUL!""  Arranged  an up-close and test drive with my long-time salesman then quickly got to the contract for our Crystal Green Metallic T5.  When he quoted MSRP and I winced, my salesman said ""the only way you'll get a 'deal' is to go get it yourself.""  Next stop, Goteborg, factory tour, delivery, a delightful two-week driving adventure in Scandinavia and return shipment home.  Fast forward 16 years and my wife still thinks it's BEAUTIFUL!  All maintenance has been done by the dealer.  Only fairly minor problems have come up and all taken care of by the dealer.

volvo,xc90,2004,Nate, 03/16/2017,Cheap plastic parts,3,"Ignition cylinders go bad and are PRICEY to fix ($5-600).  Heater on the feet only hits the right foot above the gas pedal.  There's no heat directed at the left leg.   The seats wear unevenly with the left side being smushed, and lopsided.  The most uncomfortable seat in any car I've ever owned.  

Only good thing I have to say is the engine still runs strong, and the metal is fairly rust resistant.   Many interior and exterior parts have been broken multiple times because they are made of cheap plastic in an attempt to be ""eco friendly""   which means you'll pay alot of money for a china-quality part.

Rides great on the highway including good gas mileage but around town the turbo lag is just unacceptable.  There is no storage inside in areas like the console and the stereo is not adaptable to adding bluetooth or XM/Sirius.  Additionally, the controls for the stereo are not very intuitive making it difficult to operate. The rain-sensing wipers don't seem to follow any kind of consistent operating process.  To many plastic pieces that seem to break and the cost of replacement parts are out of hand. $180 for a headlight bulb is completely crazy!"

It is so fun to drive, looks great, has great options (heated seats, navi, dvd, wood steering wheel, etc), was comfortable to sit in, and had no big problems. Only in the shop once when I thought it was making a funny noise. Dealership was great, it was still under warranty so they fixed noise and a couple other things (stereo light had gone out).  Had two kids with car seats in the 2nd row.  Access to the 3rd row was hard, but you really can't fit a human being in the 3rd row anyway. Better to keep the 3rd row down for more cargo room.

Then after the warranty was up I had to have the front steering fixed, ball joints and the rack. now the steering only makes fluid noise but still a pain. The radio is the worst ever.

I suppose I must have low expectations because we have been satisfiew with this vehicle. This is my 4th Volvo and the most user friendly. Not as fast as our S80 t but more practical.

After driving this vehicle in LA, i got rear ended badly (the Lexus was totaled that hit me) and my XC90 was a tank. I can't say enough good things about his vehicle.  "

Over 2,500 in repairs to front end, and then the transmission went at 79k At this point I traded it in on a Chevy Tahoe Z71. Much happier and haven't had nearly as much trouble.  Volvo customer service and dealership were horrible. I have owned 4 Volvo's and after this experience I will never buy Volvo again. Nothing but problems. VERY dissatisfied."

O2 sensors out at 50k. Spark plugs needed replaced at 50k.  Transmission needed replaced at 61k.  Volvo service won't stand behind the car.  I was told directly that ""Volvo for life"" is ""Just a slogan.""  Don't let the pretty looks and solid reputation fool you.  The newer Volvos are trouble.  Expensive trouble at that."
volvo,xc90,2004,Jack, 11/02/2009,Have NOT Experienced Any Negatives,4,"My wife and I ordered our XC-90 through a local dealership then went over to Sweden to test drive it for a week. Volvo shipped it back for us 10 days later. The vehicle has been perfect for the past 6 years. I am however, quite concerned with all the negative reviews here. Of all the vehicles I've owned throughout my life, I must admit that this XC-90 beats them all by far."

Has been to dealer before, who said 4 wheel drive was working normally. NO IT ISN'T! Will go to an independent if Volvo can't sort it. Suggestions are a 'damper' in the software, or a gearbox fault. Been very satisfied with overall package, but wife now wants a 4x4 that does not humiliate on a little bit of snow, or wet grass.(Hello Land Rover!!) "

volvo,xc90,2004,salebo, 07/16/2003,XC90 Great Car,4,"This car was a great purchase. The 
interior is beyond comfortable and the 
sound system spectacular. The center 
consol is a little sparce and looks 
nowhere near as luxurious as the rest 
of the car. The third row seat is 
great and fold flat down into the car, 
and the wooden steering wheel is nice. 
The availability to get the car is 
tough and getting DVD and/or 
navigation is much much harder. The 
rear backup control suprisingly came 
to be more helpful and worthwhile then 
I first imagined, and the Manumatic 
shifting is a fun feature my son 
enjoys. Compared to my 2000 RX300 this 
thing is a sports car, my take: when 
in the market seriously consider."

at best.  I feel every bump in the road,
every space between concrete slabs that
the tires pass over.  The sightlines
make driving with side mirrors a must; 
I cannot see to the left and right of
the car by turning around in the
driver's seat and trying to see objects
beyond the second row.  The fuel
consumption is ridiculous and the
engineers have some nerve requiring high
test gas."

Although the great demand limited some 
of my option choices, I can state 
without equivication that this is the 
finest atomobile I've ever owned. The 
well thought out cabin, the versatility

unbeatable, not to metion the finest

XC90 in Kansas City and that may be the

more than our garage. You name it and 
it has gome wrong. The power seat/mirror
loses memory every time you start the 
car. The fuel door snapped off when my 
10-year old bumped it, ($223 - not 
under warranty) rear windshield wiper 
snapped off while trying to clean the 
window, radiator overheats and had to 
be replaced, PVC valve rattles and had 
to be replaced only to name a few.

typical European feel when driving - 
It has gives enough road feedback and 
feels firmly planted.  It has some 
body roll around corners, but much 
less compared to other competitors 
(except the BMW and Infiniti). It also 
has the utility that many other 
midsize luxo SUVs lack. The safety

pretensioners for all seven seats,

Heard complaints of lack of legroom in 
the third row but that missing two 
inches is instead provided for a

7 passengers and I have used ith with 
everything but the drivers seat flat to 
move cargo. 

Driving the XC90 inpsires confidence. 
The SUV feels nailed to the road and 
does not suffer from the tippy feeling 
of other SUV's. It also doesn't 'feel' 
as big as it acutally is. Very easy to 
handle. 

The safety features were a huge selling 
point as this is primarily a family 
hauler. But it also was just plain fun 
for Dad to drive. More character then 
the MDX and mouch more value for your 
dollar then the Lexus GX.  The X5 is 
more of a drivers car, but offered none 
of the versatility of the XC90."

dealer later - they finally got the DVD 
installed correctly.  Strike 2 & 3 for

several other LUV's.  After 3 weeks, 
I'm not sure I'd buy another one.  It 
lacks some of the ""creature comforts"" 
found in Lexus and Acura and it's not 
as fun to drive as you might expect 
from the T6 version. The XC90 has a 
much harsher ride than I'd expect from 
an LUV in this category. Get the wood 
wheel, it's more comfortable to drive."
volvo,xc90,2004,DriverJ, 09/22/2003,Pricey But Nice,4,"We really struggled chooosing between 
this and the MDX.  We ended up 
choosing the XC90 primarliy because it 
is more luxurious.  It is also 
quieter, has a better ride and 
handling is superior.  On the down 
side, the MDX is quicker and for about 
$4,000 less you navigation and RES 
with a rearview camera!  In the final 
analysis we chose the XC90 because 
it's more prestigious, refined and  
much more fun to drive."

couldn't find a vehicle I liked better. 
Designed with safety in mind, this SUV 
drives like a car, has plenty of room, 
is very comfortable and seats 7 when 
you need to. This vehicle is very well 
thought out. Get the 2.5T vs. the T6: 
Better transmission(5 vs. 4-speed), 
better fuel economy, and faster 0-60.

only suggestion for improvement would 
to relocate the clock to a more 
central location on the dash so it 
would be visable to passengers also.  
I would highly recommend this SUV to

I have been to 3 different dealers who are unable to correct the noises, even with new brakes and shocks. While the dealers in Orange County and Covina are quite professional, the dealer in Carlsbad is useless. This car has a long way to go to call itself a premium product. There are inadequate service facilities, and I have absolutely no confidence that the vehicle will provide reliable service through the first 100,000 miles. As a suggestion, if anyone buys one, be sure to interview the local Volvo service department. Many are inadequate and they often do not have loaner cars as promised."

it's sharper looking than the BMW and

It may never match hi-performance cars I've driven but it's still quick enough and certainly handles very well.The low pressure turbo kicks in to make even highway merging stress free. True 4WD if needed.It has yet to be stranded even in deep MI snows.'W' mode makes for safe handling for us even on the icy roads. Those I've met that REALLY own one,love it. The dealership has performed as well as my car has. Volvo has been good 2 us. For those who like a car but need something bigger it 'fits'.A 'keeper'."

fun car to drive and own. "

the most confortable mid-size SUV.  It 
wont tow very much, but the T6 is great

For an SUV, the 5 cylinder gets decent

2100 miles and significant off-road duty
on our 2004, where it kept up with a
Chevy Silverado 2500.  Two days after
that trip the engine surged a few times,
steadied out, then died after one more
in-town trip.  5 days and a 360 mile
round trip to the dealer, it's back
after having the plastic air induction
shroud replaced for cracking along the
seam. (and a hassel over a loaner from

volvo,xc90,2004,New Volvo Owner, 12/01/2003,Among the best,4,"This is the best vehicles my wife and 
I have ever owned. We narrowed it down 
to the BMW X5 3.0, Acura MDX, Mercedes 
ML320, Infiniti FX35.  For us a boxy 
SUV didnt cut it, we wanted something 
a bit sportier. The BMW was our first 
choice until we drove it, too jittery, 
the Acura was nice and a bargain for 
the price but the interior was 
dull,the plastics looked cheap, and 
the outside resembles a mini-van, the 
Infiniti felt too much like a sports 
car and the ride was to stiff. The 
XC90 is a perfect blend of quality, 
comfort,fun to drive, loads of safety 
features, style, class, value, great 
transmition, and did I mention loads 
of safety features.   "

to be hers.  We visited the Houston 
auto show last winter.  She got into 
and out of every SUV there.  The Toyoto 
was too tall.  The Nissan was too far.  
And she couldn't even get over the edge

hours away, I get 17 to 19 if I'm lucky.
The first two months of ownership and 
the passenger winshield wiper fell off, 
the headlight washer cover fell off, 
the cruise control didn't work, and 
both key chains fell apart and had to 
be replaced. I still love the car. The

is great even for city driving. The

too many vehicles during my 40-plus
years of driving, it amazes me to say
this is my favorite. It handles
superbly, accelerates from most speeds
like a sports car (once you learn to
push your foot through the fire wall to
take full advantage of the turbo and
transmission), and its ride is supple
like a well-toned gymnast---muscular and
lithe. Its load space and seating are
very flexible; the stereo blows everyone
who hears it away; the seats are
comfortable for many hours; and it's
drop-dead handsome to most---always
evoking a what IS that?"
volvo,xc90,2004,BillyBoyXC90, 12/27/2003,Thanks for giving the Customer the best,4,"It is one of the few SUV that has three 
row seating.  I disagree that it takes 
up to much of the second row, in fact 
you can move the second row seats up to 
give the third row more leg room which 
is only needed if you seat an adult in 
the third row.  Another great feature 
is that unlike the Mercedes or BMW 
there is actually room behind the third 
row for bagagge,  Bottomline is that 
the seating arangement is very 
versitile and better than any of the 
other SUVs we test drove (tested 9 
different makes).
This car has not only met our 
expectations but, exceeded it.  You 
would be hard pressed to find a better 
all around SUV for a family."

6,500 miles.   Tested the MDX, and 
Pilot before deciding on the XC90. I 
average 20.4 mpg combined city and 
highway.  Today, I drove 130 miles 
with the cruise set @ 62.5mph and 
averaged 25.7 MPG for leg bumped to 70-
80MPH the rest of the 320 mile trip 
and averaged 24.5 mpg for entire leg 
(all highway).  I would've opted for 
the AWD model if available because the 
torque is too much for FWD under hard 
acceleration."
volvo,xc90,2004,steveoh, 12/27/2003,XC90 5 cylinder AWD,4,"Solid, dependable and enjoyable to drive. The 
vehicle corners extremely well. The anti-roll

volvo,xc90,2005,jdcarcollector, 03/04/2011,V8 Engine Is Prone to Catastrophic Failure,2,"Last week, our 2005 Volvo XC90 V8 'died' in an intersection. 

The dealer explained the engine had a 'catastrophic failure' and was ""dead"".
I was told the battery was dead and there is no compression -- air blew through the engine.
I asked how this could possibly have happened to a car that has undergone every Volvo dealer service, including one just 45 days ago.

The dealer was courteous but explained the car required a new engine which costs $15,000.

Google ""Volvo Yamaha V8 Failure"" and you'll come across numerous people discussing catastrophic failures thanks to the timing chain breaking.
Volvo has not undertaken a recall."
volvo,xc90,2005,JCC, 10/26/2010,Solid and safe family transport,3,"It won't win any races, but it rides and handles beautifully for its weight and height. The seats are the most comfortable of any cars I've owned. Going down the highway, the car tracks straight and feels solid. Exterior design is classy, and interior design is highly functional and efficient. The car is easy to drive and park, though the second row leg room is tight to make room for the third row and the generous cargo bay. The car was reliable during the 4 year warranty period.  On the down side, the car is underpowered while only returning so-so fuel economy. It needs a new set of tires every two years. Had some electrical problems starting year 5. Dealer service and parts are expensive."

It doesn't have tow package so it was babied by previous owner.  Thankfully the dealer is helping make good on this awful vehicle.  Test drove others and felt skipping in trans...so never again will we purchase an XC90.  And the mpg is among the worst in the crossover line at 14.2 city and 18-19 highway.

In Dec. of 2011, transmission had to be rebuilt at 87,000 miles for $4200 - dealership wanted $6500.
Then in April 2012 at 92,000 miles, the engine started knocking - balance rod failure.
I looked on line and Volvo has known that both these failures could occur in this make and model.
Never did I receive any recall or info.
I contacted Volvo of North America who offered no help to pay for these repairs. I did not rebuild engine - would cost almost what car was worth.
I sold it to an auction company for $3600. Now drive a Toyota Highlander.
Will never trust Volvo again."

The transmission has gone out three times in less than 70,000 miles.  The radiator and multiple hoses had to be replaced and the maint department at the two Volvo dealerships my car has been towed to were rude and unprofessional.  The service department actually told me that my car was poorly built and I'd be better off buying a different vehicle.  I was told by the manager that the XC90 is plagued with mechanical flaws and the gentleman that brought my car to me from the shop threw the keys on the counter and walked away without speaking.  They didn't even give me a new transmission..they stripped one from a car on the lot!"
volvo,xc90,2005,jennelle, 04/25/2012,Do Not Buy This Car,2,"Do not buy this car.
I bought brand new from the Ontario dealer.
I have had one problem after another.
However, I only have 700 characters here. Most were minor but annoying since my closest dealer is 1 1/2 hrs away and they don't offer authorized repair anywhere but at a Volvo dealership.

Now at just 60,000 miles the transmission and drive shaft have to be replaced to the tune of $5000+.
If the dealer does the repairs is $8000 .
And Volvo won't help one bit.

Talking to my local mechanic and reading the blogs the Volvo SUV have had a lot of major mechanical problems.

Do your research... do not buy a Volvo SUV you will be sorry."

I owned it for 6 months...and although I didn't have to take it to the shop at all it wasn't fun in the least bit. It had good size and visability and I def felt safe...but that's it. Gas mileage was HORRIBLE! And it ain't cheap considering you have to use premium!
My seats ripped and the sunroof leaked anytime it rained and/or took it through the carwash. Also, it approached the 70k mile mark and I noticed my transmission slipping. Time to get out and cut my loses."
volvo,xc90,2005,Gary, 02/20/2010,"Good, Safe SUV",4,"I have driven this car every day for the last 4.5 years and through 80k miles it has been a reliable and decent car. I can't say I love it, but I don't dislike it either.  Compared to our BMW X5, it is capable and OK to drive, but not a performance vehicle by any measure.  It is very comfortable for long road trips for a family of 4. It tows our 3000 lb boat with ease. V8 seems to go when you stomp on it. Cruises nicely at highway speeds 70-80 mph.  We have not had any reliability issues other than normal maintenance - tires at 45k, brakes at 60k. All and all, it has been a pretty good car."

I'm on the 4th transmission - I'm an easy, family driver, this car is terrible from a mechanical standpoint.  I've had the front axle replaced, seats breaking after small kids sit on them, emergency brake problems, fuel door breaking, etc., etc.  I like the car, but the mechanical problems are simply unacceptable for a car in this price range.......and clearly Volvo/the dealership doesn't care about transmission issues since they are replacing it for the 4th time ON THEIR NICKEL - they said each was a new trans...yeah...  Gas mileage is bad, also.  All considered, I regret buying this car.  My advise is to stay clear, if not, please buy mine!"

I never thought we would be a Volvo family but now we are.
I was looking to get my wife out of the mini van rutt we had been in since our first child.
Now the kids are getting bigger and a van is not so necessary.
I bought this car for her as a surprise.
I paid 12k for it in Dec. 2011 and it had 100k miles on it then.
The timing belt had not been done yet so I had that replaced immediately by our mechanic as well as the water pump and other belts for 500 dollars.
Since Dec. 2011 we have not spent one more dollar in maintenance other than oil changes.

I dont know where to start. New transmission at 80k, new steering rack a bit later, new hatch lock, tie rods, stabilizer links, ball bearings, joints, new breaks after 30k, leaking coolant, defective coolant lines and tubes, leaking windshield washer (broken tubes).

My Ford got 13 MPG and I saw the cost only going up.  I returned from Phoenix today (9/12/10) and averaged 23.7 MPG with the 2.5 T FWD.  It has been a trouble free purchase with the original Michelin tires still on the vichele.   "
volvo,xc90,2005,Never again, 11/12/2009,Do NOT buy a Volvo,2,"My T6 is in the shop for a replacement transmission, now in order to get any warranty they say they must replace the DEFECTIVE radiator. The cost started out at an estimate of $4800 soon it will be over $7000?  All of this at just over 100K miles. One should expect at least 150K miles from a car costing nearly $50K new. VOLVO has no Heart no soul and is not built well at all."

Have had a multitude of problems two wheel bearing hubs rear, steering rack, drive shaft, tie rod ends and two transmissions.

After living in a large city for about a year now, I can no longer handle the 12 mpg that the V8 provided me in the city, and the parking. BUT don't get me wrong

I drove my car from 67,000 to 96,000 miles. I loved every second of it. It was the SAFEST car on the road. If you don't believe me, check out the Volvo Saved my life club. I am slightly worried that the S60 won't be as safe. I had the Navigation System, TV's and Parking sensors. Never used the TV's but the nav system and parking sensors daily. Two more things I will be without, sadly"
volvo,xc90,2005,Lora, 08/01/2015,"Comfortable car, but it's a money trap!",2,"We purchased the 2005 Volvo xc90 in 2011 when it was 6 years old for $9000 which is great compared to the original ticket price of $47,000 when it was new. We bought it knowing the the 3rd row seat would not fold down. Other than that it looked great. We averaged about 16-17 mpg combined. The car itself is very comfortable but after a year of owning it, the electrical system began to fail. The dashboard would turn off while driving, the radio broke, and the windows wouldn't stay up. When we took it into the volvo dealership, they kept it for almost two weeks and finally (rudely) told us they could not figure out what the problem was. They also told us the 3rd row seat may cost up to $1000 to repair. A year later, we had problems with the almost brand new brakes. We had to have them replaced as well as all four of the $200 tires because of uneven wear. Recently, after a routine visit to the mechanic, we found out the the power steering needed to be replaced as well as the heavily fogged over headlight lamps which would cost us $2000. That was the breaking point for us and we decided to trade it in. On the way to the dealership the brakes gave out. They hesitated to give us $1000 trade in. This vehicle has been a money trap. Although the car is a comfortable ride and has an attractive interior, it is not worth the investment. Stay away. There is a reason these xc90's don't hold their value.

volvo,xc90,2005,Sarah, 06/17/2010,Worst Vehicle I've EVER Owned,3,"This is BY FAR the worst vehicle I've ever owned.  The Saturn Vue I had before buying this was more reliable!  Unfortunately for me, I was so dazzled by this ""Luxury"" SUV that I didn't do enough research. I put MORE THAN $12K worth of work in less than 6 months, the last of which was $7,000 for a new transmission that, unbeknownst to me is a HUGE issue with this year, make & model.  Volvo is conveniently refusing to acknowledge any of the innumerable consumer complaints- offer any sort of resolve or recall. Trust me I've tried-  (I've contacted the Sales Managers of every dealership in the state, and put in a complaint with Headquarters in Sweden) no one cares."
volvo,xc90,2005,Bud, 11/03/2008,Be careful,3,"The XC-90 that I have is a piece of junk!  Fortunately, when I purchased the car used with 22k on it, the dealership offered, at no additional charge, a 100k warranty. Thank goodness!  At last count, they have done over $10,000 in repairs!  If you are looking for an upscale SUV, you may want to look elsewhere!  The dealer has been great.  It is just that Volvo was asleep when they built mine!"
volvo,xc90,2005,Chris Martins, 01/10/2010,Not impressed -,2,"i bought this used with about 33,000 miles on it.  It was in the shop about a week after i bought it with many minor problems.  I've gone thru tires, ball joints, tie rods, seat heaters, and it goes one.  The dash is the exact same dash that is in my wife's Ford Windstar mini van.   I the transmission went and i had to wait 4 weeks for a new or rebuilt transmission.  The local dealer would not give out a loaner car and is not the best to deal with.  I have this car up forsale and i will NEVER by a Volvo again - the loaner i did get for other service repairs were not impressive.   I think Volvo will be like Saab before long since Ford is not getting any buyers for Volvo.  Wish i bought saab9-7"

volvo,xc90,2005,Leslie, 01/02/2010,Bought it new...still love it!,4,I am thrilled that we did not get the T6.  The only con I have is that the tires (originally Pirelli)have been replaced twice - not unusually with an AWD SUV. The 2 things that I had a problem were was the front brakes making a bizzare sound -they put something on the brakes...fixed.  The only other thing that happened was I got into the car and the engine would not turn over...dead.  Something with the key. Had to have it towed to the dealer. I was hit by a mini cooper on my side door and the car did not move. I have two small children and feel very safe. Was thinking of trading it in for a newer VOLVO XC90 but after reading the other reviews(I have only 52K miles) I think I'll keep it.
volvo,xc90,2005,twelborn, 05/17/2012,First Volvo and very pleased.,4,"I did not ever think that I would be a Volvo driver, but once I took a test drive in this SUV I knew that I had to have it. The comfort that Volvo offers its drivers and passengers is outstanding. Despite the smaller 5-cylinder engine, this car has spunky acceleration and I can manage decent fuel economy for this size of a vehicle if driven properly. I have only been driving it for about 1 1/2 months, but I have had no problems so far and this car was meticulously maintained with its previous owner so there are no problems that I anticipate should happen."

But we have had so many little issues it drives me crazy.  Here is what we have fixed to date.  Brakes all around, broken window switches, twice. fog light buttons were pushed in somehow, driver and passenger seat plastic trim, engine ventilation hose, headlight plastic hazed, engine torque mount, and the driver seat leather is incredibly worn and the steering wheel and shift boot leather is starting to flake.  The center console wood is now faded. This for a car that is always garaged and we live in non sunny Oregon!  "

First big problem: AC put out only HOT. Then the shifter/key start up had problems.  Yearly, windows always need calibration as they would roll down by themselves. Then an ABS control failed and I could not start the car. After the pitiful 4yr/50k warranty ran out (car paid in full of course) the transmission failed after 70,000 miles, cost $6500 to fix, then there was the engine leak that after 4 months of diagnosing turned out to be a leaky engine BLOCK, so I needed a new engine after 80,000 miles. Dont get me started on the electrical system.  Worse vehicle ever!"
volvo,xc90,2005,JJ, 07/30/2010,Good Family Car,4,"The car has served my family well since we bought it new. We avoided the T6 after reading the transmission horror stories. Engine is sufficient for most situations, but lacks power for highway passing. It drives and handles like a car. Gas mileage is average (16/22 mpg). Good looks outside and a very functional interior. Good cargo space with 3rd row folded down. 3rd row isn't useful and cuts 2nd row leg room. Seats are very comfortable for long trips. Dealer maintenance isn't cheap after the first 3 years which were free. Had a couple of unexpected repairs after warranty ($1,200 total). Not as reliable as a Honda, but not as bad as a BMW/MB. I'd consider buying the next generation XC90."
volvo,xc90,2005,snodave, 02/01/2008,Unbelievable do everything vehicle!,5,"We wanted a vehicle that could do it all, & this is it. Holds 7 more comfortably than anything else its size. The V8 has amazing power to carry any load, plus a heavy-duty trailer loaded with 5,000 lb of rock, yet gets more reasonable gas mileage than many other SUVs. When studded tires added for winter, it is a snow machine.  On icy days there are only two vehicles that get out of our hilly neighborhood, ours and a Hummer, none of the BMWx5s, Suburban, or other AWD vehicles can make the hill. It takes us and friends skiing in comfort and safety (with a ski box on top), it drives my kids and friends around town with ease, and will take us to the opera in style.

I still find this amount of time excessive.
I do love the car and have always wanted a Volvo.
I have had electrical issues with the radio changing stations by itself,
doors locking by themselves or not wanting to unlock.
I have not been able to figure out how to program the visor buttons to open our garage door.

Still manoeuvrable in town, despite a high turning radius. Parts and tires are durable. Fuel economy is very good on the open road and highway (12/13 l/100), much worse in town (18/20 l/100) HOWEVER, car is hefty and ponderous, taking away any driving pleasure. Steering wheel too low, even when adjusted, sunroof lets in way too much wind noise. Leather quality of seats poor. Engine feels suprisingly strained and whining under effort. Exhaust sound is a letdown. Sounds like a German V6, not a V8. Disturbing loud clunks and thumps over road bumps. Good, but not flawless"

volvo,xc90,2005,Bill, 05/17/2009,"Solid, Safe, and Practical SUV",4,"We bought a new 2.5T AWD four years ago and have been very satisfied with our purchase.  We didn't need the 3rd row seating and since they add  considerable weight and reduce 2nd row leg space, we had our dealer search for a 5 passenger model for us.  I'm glad we did, because the 2.5T engine is just adequate, given the vehicle weight.  We have averaged exactly in the 17-22 EPA mileage range - not bad for such a spacious SUV.  The XC90 has attractive, timeless styling, is appointed excellently on the interior and has a smooth, secure, stable ride. The 2.5T won't win any drag races, but is fine for our every day normal driving.  The XC90 corners pretty well for an SUV too."

It drives very well but is some what sluggish compared to the S80 T6. The interior is very nice and comfortable. I never have figured out the radio, I  guess I need a teenager. A simple radio would be nice. Gas... boy it does like gas. My S80 T-6 got 26 mpg the Xc90 does good to get 18 mpg on the highway and about 14 mpg in town"

The V8 is a pleasure to drive.  It is smooth, crisp and powerful.  The interior is among the quietest of any I've been in."

After almost losing my husband in a roll over (SUV) accident 4 years ago, we were thrilled to see Volvo come out with an SUV with such excellent safety features. The styling is also very pleasing to the eye. My children love the rear seat entertainment system with the screens in the head rests.

Performance has been satisfactory with the stock turbo 5- cyl. and have no complaints. Quality of some of the interior has been disappointing however and considering the price when new, is not equal.

The factory Pirellis lasted 12,000 miles and the replacements are going bald with about 18,000 on them.  That's expensive; especially when you add a brake job at 20,000 miles which the warranty fails to cover.  Other annoyances are a totally inadequate A/C, a stereo that picks up 1/2 the local stations and seats that don't fold up/down dependably.  When compared to the Lexus and Acura automobiles we have owned, the Volvo is equal in price, but NOT EVEN CLOSE in quality.  If you are looking at buying an XC90 make sure you get it CHEAP so you can afford the repairs."

We purchased a 2005 XC90 T6 with 39000 mi. The car was like new, had had all the factory recommended service & checked out perfect! Since the car had 1 1/2 yrs of warranty I was not concerned about reliability. Boy was I wrong!  After only 400 mi. the car has spent the last 3 weeks in the shop waiting for a back-ordered trans. The climate control is bad & surround sound cuts in & out on turns. We love the car but are afraid this is an omen of things to come. Also, the ""back-ordered"" trans tells us ours isn't the only Volvo with this problem. Can't someone make a safe & reliable car?"

My concern is that it's had 2 transmissions replaced, the latest 18 months ago along with the radiator. Not sure if I need to purchase a warantee. Dealers told me the problem is most likely cured, but if anyone has a comment, I'm all ears as I'm a bit concerned."
volvo,xc90,2005,Volvoowner4life, 06/24/2009,"Love Volvo, don't love XC90",3,"Bought my 2005 XC90 new in November 2004.  Overall, I am happy with it, but also frustrated w/the number of the same problems over and over.  Love 3rd row seats & integrated child booster.  Hate that I have had to replace my tires 2x in the past 4.5 yrs.  I have had continuing issues with the ball joints and tie rods that actually caused me to fail inspection.  They have been replaced at least 2x & I am hearing the same noises again.  There is not a ton of power or pick up with this vehicle. Also, I have had several fuses blow for the power outlets even though nothing is plugged into the very often. I would like to try the XC70 or the XC60 to see if I have better luck.  "
volvo,xc90,2005,R. Pyott, 04/09/2005,Volvo XC-90,4,"The XC-90 is fun and gives me a great feeling of security and safety.  The handling is excellent.  It has a nice turning radius.  Acceleration on the highway is very good.  The controls are conveniently positioned.  I love the exterior appearance of the car.  At first, the headrests felt a little strange but I love them now plus they are one of the only cars to pass the whiplash crash test.       "
volvo,xc90,2005,Dixon Gannett, 05/04/2005,XC90 V8 review,5,"Have owned 3 XC90's - 2 T5's.  The V8 2005 is the best vehicle I have ever owned - throttle responsive, quiet, smooth, handles very well for an SUV.  Fuel mileage: 14 city, 21 highway, (maybe 22 after break-in). City handling - excellent, highway tracking - very good.  Build quality - best I have seen in 50 years. Exterior design and fits - excellent.  Interior design and fits - excellent.  Volvo has done it with this vehicle.  I would buy another in a minute and recommend it to my grand daughter or anyone.  Hard to turn over - if at all - very safe Volvo design - Volvo for life!  Fuel economy for V8 - very good on the highway.  "
volvo,xc90,2005,Michele McArdle, 05/13/2005,consumer rating,4,"This car is so much fun to drive and I feel very, very safe in it.  Cargo capacity is great and I find I'm grateful for the space more often than I anticipated. Just wish the gas mileage was better."
volvo,xc90,2005,Steve A, 05/28/2005,Probably the best car I have owned,4,"I've owned quite a few cars until sticking for nearly 14 years with my old Honda before purchasing the Volvo XC90.  This is a solid SUV with the best safety features found.  I participated in the Volvo sponsored Driver's Experience, which trained me in how to use the various safety features on the car.  In the driving I do on Southern California freeways daily, I feel much more secure in this car than in any other car I have owned.  My two Golden Retrievers like it, too!"
volvo,xc90,2005,KD, 06/15/2005,Volvo V8 Roar,4,"Excellent, well built AWD SUV Fun to drive and solid performance for an SUV, superior handling in Hwy speeds 65mph and over. Steering Feels very light in city driving and for speeds below 50mph. A slight disapointment after a few hours driving in the Texas Freeways coming into the city traffic. Smooth roaring of V8 (audible from Driver's side only)provides constant re assurance of a serious power plant under the hood able for 311 hp."
volvo,xc90,2005,BROWN COLOR, 07/07/2005,Xc90 safest,5,Excellent in driving and safe on road tracking is very good especially in winter. i have no regrets in buying this car. Fuel consumption is also very good. My family is so happy to have this car.
volvo,xc90,2005,NMF in Indy, 07/09/2005,My 2nd Volvo,4,"I always said when Volvo came out with an SUV, I'd have one.  So, when it became necessary for me to trade in my old SUV, the first place I looked was Volvo.  The entire experience of putting together what I wanted, right up to the delivery which was earlier than anticipated, was great.  I've owned 3 SUVs prior to the XC90 and I can honestly say it far out ranks the others in most areas.  My only criticism would have to be on the placing (and lack) of cup holders.  Everything else gets pretty close to top marks."
volvo,xc90,2005,V Hencken, 07/09/2005,Don't listen to the experts,4,"When I read the reviews I was leary about the power of this vehicle.  What they don't mention is that if you live at a high elevation where horse power suffers, the turbo charged engine is huge plus as you don't lose any horsepower.  Also I have been averaging over 18 MPG in the mountains.  Sure beats my Yukon getting around 13."
volvo,xc90,2005,DKJ, 09/13/2005,Volvo XC90 Great,4,This is our second Volvo and it has been great. Feel very comfortable driving such a safe design vehicle. I used to drive American vehicles before and there is no comparison. The values and solid designs makes it so nice. Many compliments already. Kids love it. Sound system very nice. Wood steering worth it. Adds some elegance. Fuel mileage really is just like other SUVs and better than some. 
volvo,xc90,2005,jnkn of KC, 12/23/2005,Many problems - disappointed owner,4,"We had our T6 for 20 months and have had a number of problems. They include power steering rack replaced, horn malfunction, transmission seals replced, right rear hub replaced, radio malfunction.  These were are covered under warranty but for $45,000 we were hoping for a more reliable vehicle.  The also never mentioned that tires will not last more than 18- 20 thousand miles.  Be preparded to spend $900 for new tires regularly. "
volvo,xc90,2005,AWD, 01/03/2006,xc90,4,"Very attractive vehicle. Ergonomics could be better. It's hard to turn a corner without changing the radio station as the secondary controls are on the steering wheel. Right side control stalk handles too many functions making inadvertant switching on and of of, say, the rear wiper a nuisance. Front passanger seat back control a joke.  "
volvo,xc90,2005,discostu, 04/21/2006,Worst Car Ever,3,"So far this is the most expensive, and most unreliable car I've ever owned.  It has been TOWED 4 times in 18 months because it just shut off. We bought the car for percieved reliability and safety and have gotten none of the above.  The car looks great and is fun to drive, but a   car that breaks down all the time defeats the purpose."
volvo,xc90,2005,RBirns, 05/04/2006,Best all-around SUV,4,"Coming up on 3 years of ownership, so I guess this review is overdue.  This is probably the best all-around luxury SUV available.  Styling is just right-- not too big and boxy (Lexus GX), not too minivan-like (Acura MDX), not too feminine (Lexus RX), not to mail-truck (Mercedes ML).  Looks very similar to BMW X5, which is a compliment.  Ride is not as plush as a true luxury car, but better than most SUVs.  Handling is very good.  Acceleration with the 2.5T is ok at the low end, but highway passing needs more punch.  Quality materials in and out.  Only repairs were loose tie rod end (probably pothole) and dead rear wiper motor, both fixed under warranty.  Mostly city driving getting 14-15 mpg."
volvo,xc90,2005,Donald W. Davis, 10/02/2004,Early Rating,4,"There is a wind noice, that I can't

at 60mph."

volvo,xc90,2005,Brettbc, 11/25/2004,Quite Nice!,4,"After driving the MDX, Pacifica and 
several others we realized that no 
other vehicle offered the space, 
comfort, safety, towing capacity and 
handling of the XC90. With the third 
row of seats folded there is an 
amazing amount of room for our Baby's 
stuff.

But what really floored us was how 
eleghant the vehicle really is inside. 
With the leather and actual wood 
interior it just feels nice. Not to 
mention the exterior is also very 
attractive. Overall a wonderful 
combination of utility and comfort!"
volvo,xc90,2005,Brutus, 11/11/2004,Great Volvo SUV-XC 90,4,"Love this car.  It's built like a tank 
but feels more like a sports car.  
Comfortable and easy to drive."
volvo,xc90,2005,scottnhouston, 01/23/2005,Love this vehicle,4,After shopping and researching for a month we settled on the xc90 (rx330 was second choice).  We love the vehicle.  The luxurious interior and the stylish exterior.  Gas MPG has been spot on with estimates (18/23).   We do 80% city and 20% hwy thus far and have been averaging 20.2 mpg (self calculations).  Am anxious to go on a substantial hwy drive as mpg will definitely be in the 23 range which is not bad considering the weight of the vehicle.  If you are concerned about the power of the base engine don't be (unless you buy an SUV to go from 0-60 in under 8 seconds).  The power has been more than adequate.
volvo,xc90,2005,sue, 03/18/2005,I Love this vehicle,4,Not bad gas milage considering the weight of vehicle.  Love the safety features and the interior room.  Drives like my Volvo S80 and is very well equipped
volvo,xc90,2005,MKMVA, 04/04/2005,Better than expected,5,"When we purchased the XC90, we did not plan on moving and having to maintain 2 households 300 miles apart.  We have already put 24k miles on our XC90 and have not had one problem.  The fuel economy has been wonderful!  Better than expected.  Our navigation system has been a life saver in our new city.  With 3 boys.  We needed a comfortable and safe ride.  This car has fit the bill. "
volvo,xc90,2005,thorcen, 04/21/2005,Horrible Turbo Lag,2,"This car has some very nice styling but for an almost $50,000 car it has some very real problems. It has the worst turbo lag that I have ever driven, I test drove a 5 cyl. model but bought the T6. When the defrost is on, there is no heat on the floor, so if you need to have it on, your feet will freeze. The ride and comfort are great but with the problems that I talked about, I would not recommend it to anyone."
volvo,xc90,2005,Don, 06/18/2005,This is One Nice Vehicle!!!,4,"Volvo really did a nice job on the XC90. Our is two weeks old now with over 1000 miles and we continue to be impressed.  The interior layout is outstanding.  All the controls are easily reachable and understandable.  Ride is very smooth with good acceleration.  Gas mileage could be better though.  We got the Rear Seat DVD system and it is just amazing.  For a family with kids in the 11-17 range, it really keeps the noise down in the back.  We compared against the Cadillac SRX, Chrylser Pacifica and Ford Freestyle.  The XC90 blew them all away in quality, comfort and features.  It's an excellent vehicle that I hope to enjoy for many years."
volvo,xc90,2005,ABVBYND02, 06/20/2005,XC90 V8 First Trip Review,5,"We have put the first 900 miles on our XC90 V8. On our longest trip was going from Sacramento, thru Clear Lake and then up to the North Coast on Hwy 101 to near Crecent City, we averaged 20.4 mpg. That is driving thru the mountains, passing other vehicles (motorhomes and trucks with trailers). The speeds ranged from 70 on the Hwy, and between 35 and 50 thru the various towns, up and down hills and mountains. The vehicle handled like a dream,took turns in the mountains extremely well and never felt like it couldn't handle everthing we threw at it. We even took it off paved road, on a dirty, dusty dirt road, that leads to the coast, and even crossed 3 small streams.  This vehicle is awesome!"
volvo,xc90,2005,MF3681, 07/04/2005,V8 XC90,4,"Great fit and finish.  The V8 comes with the 7 seat package, rear A/C, leather, etc.  Still brand new but no initial problems, just like a high end Japanese car.  Performance is excellent and the vehicle handles very well."
volvo,xc90,2005,david carter, 09/30/2005,"mysterious noises, radio changes station",3,"For $51K one would think that vibrational noises would be non existent. On wash board dirt roads or hitting a bump in the road just right there is a harsh rattle/thumping sound coming from the left suspension. This can be felt in the steering column.There is a disturbing wind noise from the right quarter panel area at 60 mi or above. There is a strange click sound from the tail gate that happens every few minutes, this even occurs when the car is still. Most frustrating is the radio and cd player change stations or tracks on it's own. The car has 2000 mi on it,has been in the shop off and on for over a mo.and problems persists. Spoke to the owner today, not even an apology. Very disappointed"
volvo,xc90,2005,Jose Cuartero, 04/13/2006,"Got what I paid for, Volvo XC90",4,"Best SUV out there. It is very good looking, reliable and comfortable. It does consume more gas than I would like to, but all of them do anyway."
volvo,xc90,2005,petermw, 09/01/2006,We love our XC 90,4,"We received our XC 90 in Sweden and drove it 3200 miles in Europe and had it shipped to our Oregon home from London. Our family of 7 enjoyed all the comforts of the car as we drove along the highways. In spite of the high fuel costs in Europe and now in the US, we feel that it is an economical car to drive. It is easy to drive, we love the warning system when we are parking and have the car in reverse. Our local dealer is a pleasure to work with, as well."
volvo,xc90,2005,Mark, 09/28/2006,"Bad XC90 experience, bought Toyota",2,"The Volvo dealer would not even buy our fully loaded 2005 XC90 T6, that is what a piece of junk the XC90s are and Volvo knows it!   We have 6 cars including Ferraris and Hondas.  Volvo buyer beware, the only thing good about the XC90 is the ride quality.  However ride quality does not matter when the driveshaft fails(twice), the shock strut fails(twice), tires wore out(20k miles), and the left axel seal failed, stranding us on the freeway. Not to mention little things like the defroster failed and the seat heaters mysteriously turn on.  Then there are the interior ergonometric issues - try taking a family to McDonalds, there is no place to put stuff.  We sold it and bought a Toyota Sequoia"
volvo,xc90,2005,Kerry, 10/14/2006,A Great SUV,4,"I have now owned my XC90 for 2 years and still think this is a great vehicle. The ride, handling and passenger comforts are very well done.  I get frustrated hearing reviews about ""poor fuel economy"" and ""underpowered"".  This vehicle has plenty of pickup when needed and my fuel economy has met the expected EPA on the window sticker, so it should be no shock that it doesn't get 30 mpg.  I have also found the reliability better than Consumer Reports states. Much better rear cargo room than many of its competitors; easily accommodates a large dog kennel behind the 2nd row seats, something many cannot do.  Still feels, smells and drives like a new vehicle.  Enjoying it!  "
volvo,xc90,2005,Judy, 10/14/2006,I Love It!,4,I took overseas delivery of my XC90-T6 & was delighted w/every aspect of that experience!  I had a major mechanical problem w/in the first two weeks of delivery. Volvo corrected the defect ASAP and it has been a pleasure to drive since that time. I feel safe when I'm driving it and my grandchildren race for the built-in booster seat. I would not hesitate to purchase another Volvo - the factory tour in which I saw the huge roll of steel at the beginning of the tour and followed it through the factory to a finished car was very impressive and reassuring to my safety- conscious self! 
volvo,xc90,2005,scooter, 10/30/2006,A Most Excellent Vehicle!,5,"This is a fabulous vehicle for my needs, both mountain and city driving in all weather conditions. It is excellent on the highway, comfortable, easy and satisfying to drive. It has a voluminous cargo capacity and with an aftermarket rack system, all things bikes and skis are on top, safely transported. My mileage is better than sticker, 25 highway on about 18 around town. With snow tires it is a go anywhere winter vehicle. The 6CD sound system is excellent. There has been one factory recall for the front tie rod ends. I have not had any mechanical or other issues with this vehicle. It is the 5th Volvo in our extended family, and my third one. For me, this car is a keeper!"
volvo,xc90,2005,Steve, 03/31/2007,Mechanical Problems,4,"I purchased the Volvo for its safety and value.  During the 27 months I have owned it, there have been at least 10 recalls, the brake pads had to be replaced at 20,000 miles (and I had to pay for them even though I leased it with all maintenance included) AND the transmission was replaced at 37,000 miles.  I can't wait until my lease is up!"
volvo,xc90,2005,CDA IDAHO, 03/16/2008,Great Value,5,"So my wife and I spent 3 weekends looking for the perfect midsize SUV for our newly expanding family. Liked the Murano - but too small, really liked the new 08 Highlander - but a little too expensive, Acadia - a little too expensive. We looked at the 04-05 Infiniti, Acura, and BMW.... all were a little too small. We drove the XC90 the same day we drove the Acadia and couldn't help but notice the difference a V8 makes, both in pickup and engine noise. Very happy with our used purchase-- only 22k miles, all the bells and whistles.  So quiet - compared to other test drives.  "
volvo,xc90,2005,TClarke, 04/28/2008,T5has been great so far,4,"Our three month old 2005 S80 was destroyed in a multi-car accident,with us taking five seperate impacts! 2 guardrails, 3 other vehicles. Confirmed to us the Boron steel safety etc. Replaced it with a new 05 XC90, 5 turbo.  The vehicle has been great so far. 61,000 miles, and just replaced the Michelin tires.  Right rear wheel bearing went out at the same time. Struts are about ready to go. I drive it hard daily @ 20,000 miles year.  Fuel usage has been good for this type of SUV. My high was 24.1 mpg highway.  Normal city 19 mpg.  If you are not towing a heavy boat/other, this would be the engine to have, however they do not offer it this year.  I would buy one again."
volvo,xc90,2005,Larry, 02/02/2017,Great bang for the buck vehicle.,5,"Tough to beat a volvo. Outside the little s40, ever seen one rust out? Few and far between. We have a couple xc70, both over 300,000. This xc90 we just bought, for a steal, has 175,000 on it. Serviced it out with timing belt, water pump etc, and it as good as new. Love our volvos.

We attended two different ""pre-sale"" Volvo events and the Volvo Owner's half-day drive event at Laguna Seca racetrack in CA.  This car is so much fun to drive and the safety features are great.  I have read here that some have had problems with the ""turbo lag""... I took ours in to the dealer and they re- programed something and it is much better now, more peppy.  However, that has made the gas mileage go south a bit... I guess you can't have it all ???  It is still better than our old Suburban was.  We would like to check out the V8 engine and maybe trade up at a later date. "

In the past 6 months we have to bring in the car three times to be fixed ranging from electrical problems to detached trim.  This is worse than my first car, a mere Ford Escort! "
volvo,xc90,2005,Bob, 01/22/2007,6 time Volvo owner,5,Exceptionally comfortable; easy to get in and out of even for people who are shorter; mechanically and cosmetically great; a real solid feel combined with great handling; does not ride or drive like a truck; eye- catching design; have had virtually no problems; combined city-highway mileage averages 19-21 mpg.

We just recently bought the XC90 and so many of the features sold this SUV to us even after looking at several others on the market. The reliability along with the luxury is hard to find anywhere else. We see ourselves taking a Volvo with us wherever we move. The power behind it is so much better then what I could expect, handles wonderfully on an almost vertical rise. "
volvo,xc90,2005,idealltg, 10/15/2007,XC90 Transmission Nightmares,3,"My '05 T6 XC90 has already had three transmissions replaced. Lucky for me it's all under warranty but based on the frequency of the problem I'm afraid that the new transmission will fail after my warranty has expired. Looks like the only solution for my problem, since I cannot use the lemon law, will be to get rid of this thing as soon as I get it back. The dealer has had it now for two weeks. They can't figure out why the new transmission went out after only one week!"
volvo,xc90,2005,Kevin, 10/21/2009,My Volvo did not last,3,I am someone who wanted to be a Volvo owner for life . I had always heard how dependable Volvo's are . Well my XC90 was anything but . At 59000 miles I needed a new transmission . And the Volvo dealer was not helpful with anything . I am just getting ready to turn 110000 miles and I need another transmission . Also I had to put in a new drive train at 90000 miles. Along with a new front axle at 64000.  Granted I do drive alot of miles in a year. But I purchased a Volvo so I could have a safe reliable car . And my Volvo cost me way to much in repairs and way to much on rental car bills .   After my experience with the Volvo XC90 I would recommend it.

volvo,xc90,2005,j, 10/16/2009,would not buy another,4,We are on the 5th set of tires (not cheap ones either)and Volvo refuses to believe some problem.  They supposedly lined it up and even put the first set on at less than 8k miles free.  The tires wear on the inside every time. The plastic casing the seats in front sit on have broken.  One time they replaced free then I had to pay $95.00 second time and now passenger side broken.  They told me they put a better plastic on now when they did the driver seat for second time. I love the look of the car but too much trouble and would not buy another.

I had no trade in.  I feel I met my objective. The XC 90 I puchased was the advertized ""lead"" car they used to get you in the store.  The fit and finish is very good, performance on the road solid with good pick-up.  Mileage is 18 to 21 MPG. The ride is smooth and storage space adequate for hauling lawn furniture purchased at Walmart and golf bags for the weekend outing. The safety features are outstanding.  I attended the VOLVO Drive for Life Training at Dodger Stadium on 2/12/05 and now have a much better understanding of what the XC90 can do. "

I have the 2.5T and though I was concerned a 5 cylinder SUV might be underpowered, I can report positively that it is not.

Volvo has been great to deal with, we have had no problems with it. all the complaints that others mention in the review we haven't seen. Is great to drive around town or on a long road trip.

The third row seat has not been an issue and won't be unless you have a large teen or an adult in back. Even that is OK for a short ride.  However not all is good with this SUV. The AC is nothing short of terrible. The Pirelli tires that came standard didn't make it to 25K.  The plastic housing on the driver side craked. The tie rod broke at 42K  The CD player no longer works.  Lease is up and will look at GL450 X5 MDX.
volvo,xc90,2005,Eli, 09/27/2008,Great car!,4,"I just bought my 2005 XC90 with 90,000 miles on it and have put an additional 35,000 miles on it and have absolutely no problems. I have challenged snow, tropical storms, ice, and mountain roads and this car preforms with flying colors all the time! It cruises nicely and quietly on the highway and around town. The tranny was replaced with the previous owner at aprox. 80,000 miles and it feels like new. I always feel safe in this car in any environment or situation and Volvo does that magnificently."
volvo,xc90,2005,IrishSwede, 02/09/2008,XC70 v XC90,4,I traded my 2000 XC70 with nearly 200K miles for this 2005 2.5T AWD XC90 and love it.  The ride isn't quite as nice but my XC70 wouldn't tow my ski boat while this vehicle has no problems with it.  I've put nearly 15K miles on it since I bought it in 7/07.  The mileage also isn't as good as the XC70 (26mpg hwy v 22 mpg) but I can live with it.  So far my only complaint is the radio: the digital readout screen failed.  The radio still works fine yet Volvo says that the only way to fix it is to replace the entire radio.  I understand the problem is fairly common with this model and Volvo ought to develop a recall option. Overall great safe car!!
volvo,xc90,2005,John, 12/22/2004,Don't think twice,4,"I have owned almost every luxury SUV, incl. Lexus, Landcruiser, BMW, Mercedes, etc. This is the best for money and may be the best period. No seat this comfy & supportive!! I'm hard to please, but like it mucho. Chose the T5 over T6 b/c 1"" smaller wheel rim= more comfy ride. Power's fine. Price is no object for me. This is a ""steal"". BUY IT---DON'T THINK TWICE!!"
volvo,xc90,2005,L Gyarmathy, 01/06/2005,Volvo Auto Review,4,"I've owned a number of automobles, ranging from trucks, suvs, sport cars and high performance cars. BMWs, Porche, Honda S2000, and others.  This car is great.  I see myself keeping this car for sometime. It handles fabulous in all weather conditions, safe, fun and reliable."
volvo,xc90,2005,3GBE, 02/12/2005,XC90 2.5T AWD,4,"I purchased the XC90 as a move up from a 2002 XC70 and the additional space. After test driving both models (T6 & std. version) I settled on the std. 2.5T. This engine has plenty of power and I cannot see why someone would pay the extra for the T6 and the new V8... they are overkill.  The XC90 handled well in a recent snow storm and provides a comfortable ride for my 6'7"" frame. The only two complaints I have so far are: 1) both new style front and back windsheild wipers are not as good as the versions they replaced. 2) the gas mileage (so far) is not up to the reported averages. I am told this will improve as the car ""breaks in"".  Overall, I am delighted with the XC90 & would recommend it!"
volvo,xc90,2005,paster, 02/17/2005,Vermont in a Volvo,4,I was in vermont this week. On the top of a mountain the temp was 26 and the car was horrible on the ice. We put the W button on but the car just had a mind of it's own. I was frightened so bad for my life I may get rid of the car at the end of 05 or 06.
volvo,xc90,2005,Rita Bordlemay, 02/16/2005,Best traveling vehicle I have ever owned,4,"I travel up to 30,000 driving miles per year and thousands more in the air. I always try to drive when it is available since owning the XC-90. It is the most comfortable car I have driven for trips. It took about two weeks to adjust the seat, but after the trial & errors of the adjustments, I never move the seat again. I love my car."
volvo,xc90,2005,Michelle , 02/17/2005,Know where the moneys spent,4,"I really got to see where the money was spent on this car, when driving through water-logged Interstates at night in November.  I could feel a tire/tires losing grip on the flooded road, but the wheel never shook.  The power was taken off the hydroplaning wheel & applied to the ones still grounded.  It's been in bad weather where I appreciate this car the most.  I never had a problem with its pick-up/power driving through mountain passes that are so steep and windy they're only open in the summer.  Love the car.  Would highly recommend it.  "
volvo,xc90,2005,Maryland Volvo Owner, 03/25/2005,XC90,4,"After driving a Volvo 940 for about 11 years, I moved to an XC90 last fall.  I am impressed by the handling and the safety features are typically great Volvo items.  Wet weather mode and rain sensor have come in handy this winter.  "
volvo,xc90,2005,Karen, 03/27/2005,"Overengineered, Overpriced, Unreliable",2,"After 2 years of owning an XC90, we decided to sell it -- while we still could.  On average, our car was in the shop for service every 3 months.  Small, annoying things were always going wrong and they were generally related to the electrical system/computer malfunctioning.  Additionally, in two years, the car had over 16 recall items -- many safety related.    Also, for a mid-size SUV, the gas mileage was terrible.  Anyone for whom reliability is a priority should steer clear and drive directly to the nearest Acura dealership."
volvo,xc90,2005,Gabriela, 03/29/2005,My favorite car ever!,4,"I love the style, comfort, ride and safety of this vehicle. It hugs the road on a turn, is responsive, and has great pickup entering the freeway or passing. "
volvo,xc90,2005,Michele, 03/31/2005,Very Happy,4,"My husband and I had never owned a Volvo before this one, and we are very pleased after the first year.  We chose this SUV over others after attending the NYC car show, and we also have a neighbor who highly recommended it.  It is much easier to drive than the minivan I used to have, and my husband felt that the XC90 is similar to but an improvement upon his Acura MDX that is about 5 years old. We have not had to make any repairs.  The navigation system is great.  The backup beeper is terrific for those hidden objects behind.  I would highly recommend this vehicle."
volvo,xc90,2005,VailVolvo, 03/31/2005,"Vail Pass at 85 MPH, W/ Nelly thumping!!",4,"OK, I have no kids yet I have a soccer mom car.  I had an Infinity QX-4 and it was great, but I was in for a change and a car from Japan was not going to be it, ergo the VOLVO XC90 w T6 and Premium sound.  I live in Vail and blast back and forth from Vail to Denver a lot.  2 passes, windy roads, lots of snow and ice and I couldn't be happier.  The manual option for the trans is key to making it up the passes fast, I am never passed (unless it is icy and some tourist with a cowboy hat on in his rented SUV thinks he has crampons for tires) The stereo is awesome and the creature comforts are all there.  My wife has the Cross Country and both are outstanding.  Sorry to all those who hate theirs!"

volvo,xc90,2005,PJ, 04/09/2005,Love the XC90,4,"This car is really cool to look at, but more importantly so safe!  It drives so well and is so sturdy on the highway.  Even in windy conditions or passing a truck, it hugs the road and never blows around.  It has lots of interior room and is very comfortable.  "
volvo,xc90,2005,Jm, 04/09/2005,[Review by Jim],4,"I have a roof vibration that seems to have been resolved for the time being. I love the tight handling performance and accesibility into the back. There is an uncomfortable edge on the steering wheel in the design that I don't care for. The seats are VERY comfortable and I have a bad back, so I know! I wish the back seats were heated also. The GPS could be easier to use without all of the current steps necessary now. I wish the rear, side windows could vent open for the pets as they do in the Lexus. I wish also that the side mirrors would dim with the rearview interior mirror. There is a bad blind spot in the design that could be improved. I love this car even though I would change a bit."
volvo,xc90,2005,Charleskr, 04/29/2005,Love it!,4,"Safe, stylish and peppy!  High quality, very attractive, performs well--it can walk with any kid in a chevy while providing high class safety and comfort!  This is a winner!!  Owners are invited to a driving school, where you begin to find out just what this vehicle can really do!!"
volvo,xc90,2005,Steve Rasik, 05/12/2005,I feel Safe,5,"The first time I had to make an evasive move, I knew I had made the right choice in buying the XC90.  The antiroll and Stability Traction Control is flawless.  The interior is so thought out that it took me less than a day to ""fell"" where everyting was."
volvo,xc90,2005,Angela, 05/13/2005,Best car with horrible problems!,3,"Love my XC90! We have had too many issues and Volvo has done nothing to help. 1. knob on thermostat broke 2. check engine light came on and remained on till sweeden developed software to correct  3. radio-CD player was changing stations without pressing buttons (rocker switch in steering was bad)4.sunroof leaks & more... We are military living in germany and have US specs on our car.  They have blamed that for many of our problems however, Volvo has done nothing to compensate us for the 16 trips to the dealership in the seven months of ownership.They believe driving their product with the check engine light on for six months is acceptable.  They are selling us poor quality and horrible service! "
volvo,xc90,2005,n110151, 05/13/2005,My 2nd Volvo,4,"This is the 2nd Volvo that I have owned & this one thus far, has lived up to my expectations just like my first Volvo.  I have owned both GM & Ford fully loaded SUVs & this one in all areas far exceeds them.  There is more cargo space & I'd also have to say that my passengers have stated the rear seating is most comfortable & the width of the door swinging open, entrance & exiting was very easy. The one draw back to this vehicle is the extra option of the running boards I had added as they are too high & do not add to the ease in entering or exiting the vehicle.  In summary, I'll probably never own another brand of vehicle but a Volvo, just not sure if in the future I'll need a SUV."
volvo,xc90,2005,David, 05/15/2005,Another Volvo Success Story,4,"I have driven many SUV's including Land Rover, Explorer, Isuzu, and GMC - but for the value - this Volvo is the best.  It turns heads and starts conversations, looks aggressive, and yet is super comfortable inside with all the creature features you could want.  My only wish - better mileage - but it still beats the LR and Explorer in that department."
volvo,xc90,2005,Rich4rennlist, 05/17/2005,XC-90 Horiible reliabiliy,2,"I purchased a 2005 Volvo XC90 for my wife. She was driving a ML 320 and did not enjoy the drive nor the styling.  We've enjoyed the owner's driving school which was offered by Volvo for its owners but everything else has been a huge headache.  The XC90 has been at the dealer 6 times since purchase (the car is only 5 months old).  The check engine light came on 2 days after I've purchased the car.  The dealer has not been able to figure out the problem. Everytime the car is at the dealer, they are confident that the problem is solved.  They were wrong 6 times.  It makes my wonder if any of the safety features are in working order.  I can't wait to get rid of it.  I regret purchasing it."
volvo,xc90,2005,mike, 05/26/2005,My favorite vehicle to date,4,"This vehicle gives a great ride to both the driver and front seat passenger.  The second row is great for medium- sized adults and children.  As for the third row, I would say that only small children would be absolutely comfortable on a long trip (or a short one for that manner).  I feel really good about the many safety features included in the vehicle and that is the main reason I bought it primarly for my wife to drive."
volvo,xc90,2005,Big D., 06/12/2005,so so volvo,4,"Well with now 35000 miles on my XC90 numerous things have been addressed. New rear wheel bearings, Complete front brake job @25000 miles. Rattles coming from places that myself or the dealer cant find....still over all with the things that did go wrong(they were replaced under warranty) its been a good vehicle."
volvo,xc90,2005,???, 06/14/2005,I love it,4,"the only complaint I have about my xc90 is the key! It continually comes off my key chain and the mfgr fix didn't fix it!  Otherwise I'm a convert. I owned five bmws before the xc90 and theres just no comparison when you match price drivability and quality. the gas milage is excellent too. I have a 2004 now but i'm ready to trade for the 8 cylinder version.  I have 51,000 miles on mine so you know I live in my car."
volvo,xc90,2005,Jeff Dickens, 06/14/2005,Volvo XC-90 SUV Review,4,"The XC90 is the 6th leased Volvo in our family.  We lease them because of the confidence we have in the safety engineered into the vehicle.  I never anticipated just how safe the XC90 is, until I was offered and participated in the Volvo XC90 off road ""Owner Experience"" driving test.  This car performed far better then my expectations.  The Dynamic Stability and Traction Control along with the Roll Stability Control performed flawlessly, and gave me complete confidence that this vehicle is capable of responding well under a wide variety of hazardous road conditions.  I spend much of my time in the XC90, and this is probably the most comfortable, enjoyable and safest car I have ever driven. "

It comfortable and fun, from dressing up for a nice dinner to heading out to the beach with your surfboard on the roof rack, I LOVE IT!!"
volvo,xc90,2005,KerryLD, 07/08/2005,Volvo XC90,4,"I just purchased this vehicle.  My first feeling was that the car was neither as luxurious or as smooth a ride as it should be for a ""luxury SUV."" It is hard to work the third row seat when attempting to lay them down. Also it is extremely difficult to see behind on either side because of the headrests, front and back. The car has many blind spots which make for uncomfortable backing up. As the ""safest"" vehicle on the road they should have given you better visibility.  Finally,though, the true value of the vehicle showed when I hit a large pool of water and did not skid or move from side to side. There is nothing like sitting in the front seat at 65 mph and feeling that sense of safety."
volvo,xc90,2005,ValerieNJ, 07/09/2005,Love my XC90,4,"I spent over a year deciding on what SUV to purchase.  Seriously considered the Lexus RX330, and the BMWX3 the Volvo XC90 won my heart!!!  I wanted an SUV for cargo space and I wanted comfort. The XC90 rides like a car, gets better gas mileage than my '97 jeep.  I get 21 mpg highway and about 18 city.  I was concerned with the 2.5 turbo, no problem it has wonderful pick- up on some very major hills.    I purchased a Demo from the dealer 3 months ago and have had no problems since I've owned the car.  Absolutely love driving this car on long road trips.  It is very comfortable, hugs the road, feels very stable.  I also own a nissan 300zx for my summer driving and can't get out of my Volvo.  "

I feel very confident that I have the best protection available in a car.  The XC90 handles very well.  I would buy this car again in a heartbeat.  Like all SUV's I wish it had better gas mileage but safety is worth it.   "

It is every bit as comfortable as my last car, a 2001 S80. The turning radius is better than the S80 which makes it easy to park even in tight spaces. I did not get the third row of seats and I'm so glad. The ""trunk"" space is large and so well designed. I use the pop-up area for transporting anything that could tip over. It is my favorite feature. I also love the solid feel of this heavy car. The safety features are outstanding and that's really why I ultimately decided on this car but it has it all. I also think it is the best looking SUV on the road!"
volvo,xc90,2005,Jeff H., 01/25/2006,First Volvo,4,"My father bought a Turbo Diesel Volvo a few years back and it turned out to be a lemon.  After all the hassles of dealing with the State, Volvo and the dealership, he finally got his money back.  So why did a buy a Volvo?  I wanted to go to Sweden.  I wanted to get the R station wagon, but she wanted the XC90.  She won.  I took overseas delivery of the car.  Volvo arranges everything.  Great trip.  Once the car arrived stateside, I drove it back home using highway 199 that connects Grants Pass Oregon to Crescent City California.  The car stuck to the road like glue.  Very little sway and very responsive.  Great breaking going into corners and plenty of power exiting them.  The future?"
volvo,xc90,2005,Rick A, 02/05/2006,A very good expierence with our Volvo,5,We simply would unequivocally recomend a Volvo XC 90.  Safe reliable and fun to drive.  It is also a very capable 4 wheel drive.

As others have mentioned it has spent some time in the shop and seems to be recalled every 6 months or so.  The XC90 is a very safe SUV and has a vault like feel to it very similar to Mercedes Benz.  My biggest issues are all the little things that go wrong with it.  I am now replacing the chrome window trim on the drivers side for the 3rd time.  The design of this is so poor, its held to the window frame only with double stick tape.  There is also a removable armrest/storage compartment that is starting to fall apart and Volvo is refusing to replace or repair it.  A great service department is key to owning this vehicle."

volvo,xc90,2005,Jim Barnacle, 12/16/2004,Major Disappointment,2,"My 2.5 Turbo moans and groans it way
around town delivering me 15 miles to
the gallon.  The SUV is particularly
annoying to drive in traffic because the
car hesitates off the line (turbo lag
I'm told).  The vibration of the turbo
reminds me of a diesel. When I exit the
car the vibration stays with me.  This
is a sad excuse for a premium SUV.  I
actually enjoyed my 2002 Ford Explorer
more than this overrated piece of junk.
 I feel betrayed by the automotive press
for their positive reviews.  M"

such a pleasure to drive that I

it has tons of room.  Got the 5

its poor gas mileage, I get 14 city,

Been in the shop over 6 times for warranty items ranging from the air intake on the engine to the air vents breaking.  Most frustrating is that the same parts keep breaking.  The air intake has been repaired 3 times and the vents 2.  I've also been frustrated with trim parts falling off and the third row seat breaking.   I've owned Volvo's for years and have had little to know problems other than routine maintenance.  This Volvo is the vehicle I love to hate.

The XC90 fits the bill perfectly.  The 3rd row is usable by almost everyone - kid and adults alike, and when stored the cargo area is large.  The SUV drives like a car, and you feel completely in control at all times, even during our nasty winter weather.  All in all probably my favorite car I've ever owned."

It's a design flaw, I'm told). My old s80 was just wonderful and carried me everywhere in quiet, effortless style.  I had absolutely no problems with it.  This thing is a loud, poorly put- together ""luxury"" vehicle that gets me 13 miles to the gallon in the city (better on HWY, of course).

Sluggish off the line but once you are up to speed, keeps up very easily with traffic.  My biggest issue with the XC-90 are the blind spots on both the drivers and passenger side.

volvo,xc90,2005,J Sube, 06/17/2005,Once you've gone Swedish...,4,"After driving Saabs (900SE Conv, 9-5SE Sedan) for nearly ten years, I wanted to move to an SUV and bought a Toyota.  Although it was highly reliable, I was bored beyond belief with it.   So, along came the Volvo XC90 T6 AWD in Graphite Gray -- great looking, so very comfortable, excellent driving experience, great gadgets, and hauls a lot of stuff easily (dog, people, and things on weekend trips to the beach house).   My only complaint is that I didn't wait two more months to get the 8-cylinder engine.  On long up hill segments of road (local streets, etc), it often whines when the turbo has to kick in to move up the hill.  Other than that, I love the vehicle and recommend it to all."

volvo,xc90,2005,Bruce, 06/20/2005,Almost Perfect,4,"Great car. I dislike only a few things about my XC90 (and  why I'm trading it for a V-8 XC90 with a ""graphite"" interior). The first negative, perhaps niggling: when the sun spills onto the dash from the correct [and often] angle, the end-dash airvents shine in the side windows blocking the use of the rear-view mirrors. Second angers me: the turbo 6 in combination with the 4-speed transmission goes into drastic turbo-lag just as you accelerate rapidly into traffic. There's a third item which is gremlin-like: on three occassions I've turned off the ignition, gotten out, locked the car with the remote, and returned to find the AC fan running on max and the soundless radio speakers crackling."
volvo,xc90,2005,cnirenblatt, 06/22/2005,Hit or miss with Volvo,2,"For a $40,000 plus vehicle, I'm really looking at getting a Lexus next go around. I can't believe all the bells and whistles that don't come with this car at this price. Sure it's safe. I get about 17.5 mpg, but already the seat adjustment on the driver's side has become unattached, the power windows are whacky sometimes by going down when I want them to go up and frankly I'm just disappointed in the service department here in Charleston, S.C. When I took a look at the Lexus RX330, I couldn't believe all the ammenities you can get with the same emphasis on safety for a lot less money. I'm now looking at trading in the XC90 for a Lexus either GX or RX model. I think Volvo should do better."
volvo,xc90,2005,Dawn, 07/16/2005,Volvo #2,4,"After driving a cross-country that had worn a path to the Volvo service center, I took a chance on another Volvo.  I am so glad that I did, as the XC 90 is a beautiful car that is comfortable and fun to drive.  It is well-suited to my small frame, and is extremely comfortable for the kids in the back.  The power is not as impressive as some of the V8's that I tested, but its more than enough to put me ahead at the traffic lights! I do wish they were more creative with spaces for cell phones, sunglasses, etc.   The location of the cruise control button drives me bonkers, as it sits right where my finger hits it when I hold the wheel.  All in all I just love the secure feeling of a Volvo."
volvo,xc90,2006,Dianne Syring, 07/10/2005,Good times with grandchildren,4,I wanted safety features. As a grandmother of three that spends time with the children in the car. I love the built in toddler seat. Recently took a beach trip with 2 daughters and 3 grandchildren and we were all very comfortable and had plenty of room for gear. 
volvo,xc90,2006,cjbluedevil06, 12/16/2013,Excellent Used Car Value,5,"I purchased my XC90 2.5T in March of 2013 with 74K miles. It is the third Volvo that I have owned and is by far my favorite. I traded in my 2004 S60 to buy the XC90. Many people say that the 2.5T engine is underpowered, but I feel that its 208hp feels peppy and is perfectly matched to the transmission. The handling feels confident and the seats are very comfortable. As far as cargo spaces is concerned, I am pleased.
Fuel economy is decent for a vehicle of its size. I average about 17 in town and 23-24 on the highway. The cabin is quiet and the interior is composed of high quality materials. My vehicle has the optional navigation system, which is nice, but inputting information can be an annoyance.

Update** 2016
It is now three years later and I will say that buying a used XC90 was a great decision.  I now have 111K miles on my XC90 and I have been impressed with the reliability of the vehicle.  I recently visited the Volvo dealership for regular scheduled maintenance (replacement of the timing belt and drive belt) and spent about $750 for that service.  When the dealership completed the maintenance inspection during the visit, they were unable to find anything that needed to be replaced or repaired. They key to buying a used Volvo is to ensure you buy it from a Volvo dealer and research the maintenance history of the vehicle. Aside from buying tires and having oil changes, the most I have spent on the vehicle has been for the timing and drive belt service. I have not had a single issue. It is my hope that I am able to put 200,000 miles on my XC90.  Once I am done with this one, I do plan on buying another XC90 or an XC60. When it comes to safety, reliability, and quality, I find it hard to beat. It is an excellent road trip vehicle and is the perfect size to accommodate passengers and cargo. I do wish the fuel economy was a little better, but I do have to keep in mind that for a 2006, it falls in the more fuel efficient range of most SUV's for that time.  As a final note, if you are looking for a used XC90 for whatever reason, it is best to stay away from the T6 (2.9 liter I-6 cylinder turbo engine) variants made from 2003-2005 and the V8 engines.  The 2.5T's (I-5 cylinder turbo engines) were discontinued in 2006 and did not suffer from the transmission issues of the T6 and V8 engines. The years 2007+ models with the 3.2 I-6 cylinder engines are also very reliable. I mentioned this in my review a three years ago, but it bears repeating since I can't stress it enough :-)

5/13/2019 Long Term Update
Overall, my XC90 2.5T has continued to be reliable and I love it as much as I did when I first bought it. I am now at 136,900 miles to date.   Additional repairs since my last update (written above three years ago) include a new alternator, one new motor mount, and new Variable Valve Timing Hubs (Expensive!!!).  Overall the only expensive unexpected repair since buying the vehicle in 2013 has been the Varible Valve Timing Service. (I expected I would have to replace the alternator at some point). I would buy it all over again. The rest of the costs have been spent on maintenance (new gas cap, proactive replacement of my mass air-flow sensor, and Ignition coils, and cabin air filter, all which I replaced myself).  Just as a note, I actually got my parents to buy a XC90, a 2005 2.5T with 80K miles a little over a year ago.  My parents love! It has been consistently reliable.  Mine is Front Wheel Drive and theirs is All Wheel Drive.  If you are on the market for a used XC90, I would suggest skipping the AWD versions all together unless you absolutely need AWD.  It is another point of maintenance that can become expensive and my parents started experiencing issues with their AWD. This is typical and not a surprise. Their vehicle is still reliable despite that issue. I intentionally selected a FWD version to eliminate that point of
 maintenance and I am happy I did!

Even after 13+ years, I still get people who are so surprised my Volvo is the age that it is. I attribute that to it being in such great condition (paint, interior, leather, etc).  When I took my vehicle into my new mechanic for the first time for an oil change he said “Wow! Your car looks brand new underneath!” And then when he put it out on his lot waiting for me to pick it up, two people stopped by his shop asking if my XC90 was for sale. :-) since he also sells vehicles.

volvo,xc90,2006,Cleen, 10/12/2010,not so sure about this car,3,"Bought this car used from the local Volvo dealer.  With only 38,000kms on it & half the price of a new one it seemed like a no brainer. It also came with the entertainment package & third row seating. I want to love this car. I think it is the best looking SUV out there. It handles beautifully it's unassuming & overall a great family vehicle. But. I can't get over how loud the engine is, and how poorly it accelerates. Go up a slight incline it sounds like the transmission is slipping. Coming down a decline, it does the same thing and clunks into gear. It really bothers me.  I keep thinking it has transmission problems.  Also, at 2500 rpm it revs really loud! It's being traded in for an LR4."
volvo,xc90,2006,Volvoluvr, 08/25/2010,In love with my Volvo,4,"We purchased my Volvo used in 2007 and it had 36,000 miles on it.  We had recently had our second child and loved the safety features and quality of this car.  (Not to mention it is beautiful) It came with a few flaws, poor fuel consumption and rear doors that don't open wide enough in the back to get kids/groceries misc in and out.  Third row is a joke really, no room for normal sized adults.  Ok for children but hard to get them in and out.  Overall this vehicle made me happy for 3 years and we never had any repairs other than scheduled maintenance.  Just traded it in on a minivan due to our THIRD child arriving, but still missing my Volvo.  I'll have another one again someday."

This is an all-weather and light off-roading vehicle with luxury that is more fitting to a family. The way this SUV is built - it's a best buy for a reasonable price.

Extremely fast and agile for a 4600 pound car.  The V8 sounds great and is also a work of engineering art.  The fit and finish of the XC90 is about as good as it gets.  Compared the XC90 to a BMW X5 which costs at least $10,000 more and the Volvo wins hands down.  Plus, I'm a big guy, 6'4"", 265 pounds and feel very comfortable in the car.

We didn't know it had a transmission that COULD NOT be repaired ONLY REPLACED.


The Volvo dealership informed us that this particular transmission was not repairable.
Unfortunately our warranty company wouldn't ok the replacement so we had to transfer the car to a transmission repair facility to try and rebuild it.
They were able to get all the parts needed but 1 and Volvo wouldn't sell the 1 part that would fix our car.

You only need a V8 if you plan on towing. Drive it in and around Calgary, which gets a wide range of weather conditions. The AWD is particularly impressive in the rain and snow (winter tires are necessary for half the year, of course). Other than routine scheduled maintenance, have only had a couple of fixes (head light and wheel bearing) which were covered under warranty."

The gas mileage of the first three has been acceptable. I was not prepared for the disastrous mileage of my xc90. It has a T-5 engine (five cylinder). My average mileage is 12.5 miles per gallon. It is obvious to me that I cannot keep this car. The comfort, style, and performance are outstanding, but I can't afford the mileage. I have done everything to put the car in tip-top shape, even the sparkplugs which cost $25 each. The motor performs well, and is extremely smooth. My only hope is that the software can be updated to give me better mileage. And this is more of a wish than a hope. No, I didn't do 'due diligence' when I bought this car, because of the great experience of my prior Volvos.  I know I'll lose money trading, but I'll lose more money keeping this particular car. My wife and I are up in the years, and this was to be our last car; but it will be, I hope, our next to lat car. I can't wait to trade. I can get a luxury car with better mileage.

No comparison with the T6.  T6 noisy, rough running and a gas hog.  V8 smooth as silk and much better MPG. Also, the T6 was a five passenger, the V8 a 7.  The V8 rides much smoother because of the self leveling rear. All in all a world class vehicle with a top IIHS safety rating. You can spend a lot more money on an SUV and I don't think you can buy a much better vehicle.  Dollar for dollar an excellent investment.  "
volvo,xc90,2006,Robert Stuart, 09/14/2015,Volvo converted me to BMW,1,"Over 1/2 the cars we've owned have been Volvo...This one will change that. This has had constant noise in the form of clunks, squeals and rattles. There is always an error light or message on and we've spent a small fortune on parts. I'm a certified ASE mechanic and do all my own work but this has been a challenge. New rack and pinion, new exhaust, new struts, new springs, new tie rod ends, new radiator, new pulleys and new tires every 15K. This thing cant keep tires or brakes! 

The gas mileage is great, the power wonderful but everything else failed. The stereo is substandard and no one will touch it for aftermarket because of Volvos proprietary computers. The mirror trim has fallen off, the light dimmer/turn signal indicator fell off, windows get stuck. In short, this has left my wife stranded more then any vehicle she's owned. 

Tried to talk with dealership about issues but they create even more...worst dealer we've ever worked with. Tried to talk with Volvo and they didn't care. You can get a lemon but when the dealer and the manufacture wont help and in fact, exasperate the situation, it tells you it's time to move on. We're shopping for two new vehicles and wouldn't consider owning another Volvo. 

We actually bought a 2012 BMW X3. It's the best vehicle I've ever owned. Customer support is off the charts compared to Volvo and the vehicle arnt even in the same league! I'm angry at myself for waiting so long to get rid of Volvo...you really can enjoy your SUV

volvo,xc90,2006,Toddow, 07/29/2009,It's OK,3,"I've decided to write an objective review.  I've had the opportunity to own numerous cars/truck/suv's in my lifetime.  The XC-90 first of all is an outstanding ride.  I drove it all the way from Arizona to Alabama and have driven it on short trips as well.  It's a great ""in-town"" SUV and the saftey features make you feel very secure while driving it.  The interior is sub-par, and most items feel flimsy.  The center console ""creaks"" whenever you touch it and the dials are a little childish looking.  But, with that the ride is awesome and the service (only every 7500 miles) lets you know you're driving a Volvo."
volvo,xc90,2006,vince, 11/30/2010,nice suv,4,"Bought this car Aug.2009 and 98,000kms but still good condition,I drove from calgary to winnipeg, and its fun to drive,it's only 2.5 cylynder but good in the highway,I love it..."
volvo,xc90,2006,Flyingman, 08/07/2006,First Volvo,4,"I was close to buying a VW Touareg before I test drove the Volvo.  I found the volvo to have excellent power in the 2.5T, better mileage, and more space.  I prefer the boxier look over the bubble look that is currently so popular. Only have a few 100 miles, but am really impressed with handling, especially on Hwy.  Mileage is mostly city, so in the lower mid teens, but on hwy it was very close to advertised, 22-23mpg. It does not have any cheesy extras you really don't need, very practical. A bit sluggish at parking lot speed but if you punch it front tires will screach out without hesitation. I'll follow up in a few months but for now I'm very pleased overall with this purchase."
volvo,xc90,2006,Wally, 07/30/2007,Excellent car,4,"An excellent car, firm ride.  You have the feeling of being in a safe car.  Goes through snow with ease. Very good handling.  I recommend this car to anyone who wants a safe car.  Gas mileage is a bit off and the gas tank is relatively small for a car of this size."
volvo,xc90,2006,Jan-Michael, 07/13/2005,The most awesome SUV,4,"The Volvo XC90 V8 is a suv with a very good performance, and to drive it almost feels like a volvo V70 or a similar car. The brakes are really effective, and the seats are really comfortable, but a sunroof would be perfect above the third-row seats. The XC90 has a huge cargoarea if you fold down the third-row seats, it's the same size as in the Excursion, or even bigger.  The XC90 is the best SUV I've ever driven. It has awesome performance, good cargoarea, Superb Audio-system, awesome quality, quick'n'easy removeable tow- hook. The materials in the car is very well chosen, everything feels ""well done"", nothing feels cheap or plastic.  "
volvo,xc90,2006,Tony, 12/07/2009,Performs quite well,3,"We bought ours as a certified pre-owned vehicle and have had no problems what so ever since purchase. Overall the fit and finish of the XC90 is very good and reliability is excellent.The 2.5T is not a powerhouse of an engine, but on the highway and around town its adequate. It's a good,safe family car."
volvo,xc90,2006,Celeste, 05/27/2010,Love it so far!,4,"We bought this car about 6 weeks ago & I really love it. It fits my kids' two car seats easily & will fit a third - all in the second row. I've read that it doesn't have that great of pick up when you accelerate, but I haven't found that to be the case at all. Drives great, love the sunroof, really love that the backseat has a/c vents for the kids! It is without a doubt the best car I've ever driven (have previously owned Chevys & an Acura). "
volvo,xc90,2006,Liz Lerch, 09/14/2005,I love this Vehicle,4,This is a great vehicle. It is very well engineered. The third row seat is so easy to use and the kids love it back there.  The car feels solid and safe. It holds the road beautifully and is quiet inside. I feel encapsulated in quality and luxury when I drive it. The stereo sounds great and is easy to use as are the temp controls.  I drove a lot of other cars before choosing this one and none of them came close to the quality of the XC90.
volvo,xc90,2006,San Diego Guy, 09/22/2005,Glad I bought it,4,"I love my XC90...the car is well designed and has been solid as a rock so far.  Buying experience was the easiest I've ever had and the car has lived up to its billing by Volvo.  Only flaws so far has been the headlight washers which just squirt onto the hood (had the dealer disconnect) and the Homelink system had to be replaced, but Volvo took care of both.  Mileage could be better, but I'm getting about 18.5 mpg combined driving so not too bad.  Get one if you want a well built, comfortable, and fun SUV to drive!"
volvo,xc90,2006,frank, 12/27/2005,Excellent midsize,4,"The child locks is an on and off buttom which is a pain with an older and younger kids, need individual door locks.  Interior kinda cramped on long trips.  huge Key.  Need hatch opening button on key.  "

volvo,xc90,2006,wricke, 04/15/2006,Great riding SUV,4,"This SUV rides like a sedan.  The Yamaha V8 gives it plenty of power. I can't say enough good things about it.  The roomy interior has a clean, elegant look to it and the stereo is excellent and powerful.  Considering the projected resale value (best in class) You should not hesitate to buy one. "
volvo,xc90,2006,Corby, 11/21/2006,You get what you pay for,4,I have had my XC90 for just over a year now.  It's the best vehicle I've ever owned but has some small drawbacks that I can overlook. The driver seat is already starting to feel as if it is wearing on the outer bolster.  Overall it handles great for its size and does better than great on the autobahn in Germany at speed.  The 6-speed tip-tronic changes are somewhat slushy during gear changes.  I still compare it to the Touareg and LR3 that my co-workers have and I find it to be a better vehicle than theirs.  Some of the options could come down in price.  Over $3k for navigation is too much.  I bought an aftermarket system for less than $600.  But you pay quality money for a quality SUV.
volvo,xc90,2006,Lisa, 12/22/2006,volvo,4,"Great car for the family!  I have had Mercedes, Navigator, multiple explorers...  Great car- don't like the gas mileage even on the 5 cyl. and was really surprised at how poorly even with Traction Control the car was in the snow."
volvo,xc90,2006,Cindy, 03/21/2007,Is it worth the money?,4,"I also own this vehicle because of its safety reputation. And of course my children's safety is priceless. However, I've also driven the Honda Pilot and with its amenities, reliability, and 3rd row airbags, can the volvo really be worth over $10K more? If I could do it over I would have bought a Honda Pilot. "
volvo,xc90,2006,amy, 09/07/2007,"So far, so good",4,"I've had my '06 for 16 months now but before that had an 05.  Just test drove an ML 350 from Mercedes and I must say I prefer my Volvo. Granted the ML had a few features that were nice but overall, my Volvo had much more comfortable seats and more features for the price, i.e. dvd system, memory driver's seat, etc. I also have much more cargo area in my Volvo and because it's a bigger car I have more legroom and just feel safer. Close the doors on the Mercedes and do the same with the Volvo and you'll know the difference. My only gripe so far with the Volvo is the cheaply made stereo speaker units in the front corners. Should be better for a 50K+ vehicle."
volvo,xc90,2006,Derrick, 12/12/2007,my 2nd xc90,4,"This is our second xc90, we loved our 2004, but we wanted the rear entertainment package, so we traded for a 2006 with everthing. After looking at some other SUVs recently due to co-workers buying new ones I wouldn't trade mine for anything else I've seen out yet."

volvo,xc90,2006,teddym, 04/03/2012,DON'T buy a Volvo,2,"My XC-90 is horrible, front to back.
Friends dont let friends buy volvos. Treatment from the volvo dealerships in Houston is horrible, unless you are super rich, they will certainly hook you up, otherwise, bring your checkbook.
You pay out the nose to own a volvo. My xc-90? 3 sets of wheel bearings burned out, the rear end went out, the fuel pump has already been replaced, the CURRENT check engine light issue will cost me $1,000, just put $1,500 into it to get the steering column to work again, the Houston dealership seriously jacked me over. you HAVE to take it to the dealership. They know they've got you by the throat. OBTW, my windshield leaks. Headlights fogged from inside. $500 each"
volvo,xc90,2006,Andy, 07/28/2010,2006 2.5T AWD XC90,5,"Great use of space. Either 7 people or lots of cargo space. I live in Colorado and the turbo provides excellent power for high altitude driving. Had some friends compare a Lexus rx with an xc90 on I-70 in the  high winds (40-50 mph and gusty) that we sometimes have on the front range, and they said the xc90 was vastly superior. Don't know about the Lexus but my xc90 handles these winds like no other car I've ever driven."
volvo,xc90,2006,Me, 10/03/2006,Bad Bad SUV. Frustrated,2,"I purchased the Volvo XC90 V8 due to the safety and convenience features.  I have nothing but problems with the SUV.  It stalls and is a hazard.  Upon checking the internet, there are many purchasers that have had problems with the Volvo XC90.  Next time I will stick to Toyota/Lexus.  This Volvo is a headache.  By the way, this is supposed to be my wife's SUV.  She is 7 months pregnant.  She will not be driving this vehicle!  Another issue is the towing capacity.  It is rated at 5000 pounds.  This is with the driver only.  Any passengers and cargo decreases this capacity rapidly.  Also, it requires a transmission cooler and brake controller.  The dealers won't install them."
volvo,xc90,2006,mj10990, 01/04/2006,Great vehicle 2.5T has plenty of power,4,"All around terrific vehicle and terrific value compared to other luxury SUVs. Comfort, safety, beauty, performance are all outstanding! The 2.5T is more than enough power. The V8 is overkill-I drive over two ski slopes to get home and have never felt a lack of power. We narrowed it Between the Acura MDX and the Volvo. We got a better deal on an 06 Volvo than on a 05 MDX. Better looks, better gas mileage, better comfort and Acura has horrible dealers. AND we love Volvo's politics (the $500 donation to HRC was great)! Finally-18-20mpg is outstanding for a 4500lb vehicle!!!!  For comparison, Reviews say The MDX is getting 13-17! XC90 is averaging 18-20!"
volvo,xc90,2006,Dave and Angela, 10/14/2005,Safest SUV on the road,4,"We picked up our XC-90 in Gothenberg, Sweden in June 05. What a fabulous experience. The factory delivery program is just one of the best!! We toured Sweden for 8 days in great comfort before flying elsewhere and shipping this car home. Our trip was very memorable, had a lot of fun driving this spacious SUV around the country, putting 1000 miles on it.  It has great pick up, very stable feel and we just love it!!  This is our 5th Volvo, 3rd new one, all still running.  Two are now owned by another family member. 3 of them have over 200K miles and running great. We have had no repair problems whatsoever with this car.                                                                   "

Very happy with the looks outside and inside. After a 5 months I had some problems, some anti-skid message that kept coming up, they said it was a computer problem but it happened twice. Possibly due to extremely horrible speed bumps where I live the car began making weird clicks when the gas/brakes were pressed; brake pads, alignment, sub-frame, etc all needed work. Right window makes whistling noise. DVD system headphones sound fuzzy sometimes. Very fast for an SUV, and I always feel safe."

volvo,xc90,2006,Alex, 02/17/2009,Perfect Family Car,4,"We bought this Volvo one summer and have been loving it ever since. The car is very spacious and is very kid proof. If you have small children it is great because its got a built in booster seat and moves forward so the parts and reach the child easier. The XC90 5 Cylinder can be slow at times but when you step on it, it goes and handles very well. The rides very smooth and for the price comes with so many options. You can pay 10000 more for a BMW X5 with all the same features but not the same safety. "
volvo,xc90,2006,Sandra Nicholson, 07/25/2005,owner,4,"This vehicle is everything I expected. It handles great, has a luxury interior and a updated exterior design. The only complaint that I have is that the vehicle accelerates a bit slower that I would prefer. This is due to the weight of the vehicle. The weight of the vehicle is what offers safety. To sum it up, I would rather be safe thant accelerate quickly."
volvo,xc90,2006,Ray Clay, 08/16/2005,Happy Mom of 3 Boys!,4,Wonderful and easy handling.  I purchased because I wanted a safe family vehicle.  I received luxury and performance on top of safety.

I was fortunate enough to get a loaner V8 by the dealer until mine arrived.  I don't have anything bad to say about it and it is a pleasure to drive.  Incredibly great handling and a very solid feel. We drove just about every luxury SUV and it was really a very easy decision for us.  The rear seat entertainment is the best on the market as far as we are concerned; much better than the ""drop down"" systems. Excellent car choice, especially with people with small kids!  "

I wanted the Highlander until I drove it, I love Toyota but my leg continuously went to sleep.  We have a 95 850 which has been a great car.  This SUV will fit those of you that are tall and short (wife is 5'2). I had a V8 truck and went to the smaller motor and really like it"
volvo,xc90,2006,delawaredriver, 01/05/2006,8 Cylinder Wonder,4,"This is a great vehicle.  The 8 cylinder engine is terrific.  It is comfortable with clean and efficient design inside and out.  Handling is great.  I sometimes forget that it is an suv. The six speed transmission is very smooth, but sometimes hesitates a little as it searches for the right gear. Volvo hit the mark with this one.  "
volvo,xc90,2006,Lux, 01/07/2006,"Comfort, Size and Performance",4,"We love or XC-90 V8.  We are in Germany and get to open her up on the Autobahns. Very comfortable quiet ride even at 100+ mph.  Sounds system is very nice and Navigation system is a real plus for overseas and unknown area driving.  Plus there is room for all our stuff and the dog.  Finally, it is nice to know we are well protected while we cruise the autobahns with all the safety systems Volvos are know for; and now unlike in the past the vehicle is stylish and looks great."

Lots of standard features plus received free incentives. Highway ride is wonderful. Was able to transition easily from the S40 to the larger XC90.  Intimidating at first, but after the first trip, it's still a Volvo! "
volvo,xc90,2006,Cindy Fabre, 02/13/2006,Excellent Car! Great Price,4,"I have this car fully loaded.  The navigation is great.  It prompts you, big screen, and is accurate.  I also love the DVD system.  The twin screens are great.  The car drives smoothly, and I have no problems (knock on wood).  I had previously owned the merceds that had issues every few months.  This is an excellent value for the price and you can put the cheap gas in.  The Booster Seat is also a great feature."
volvo,xc90,2006,RRyba, 05/30/2006,Best of the Bunch,4,"Before going for the XC90 V8, I drove the Porsche Cayanne S, Lexus GX470, Lexus LX470 and Acura MDX, Whiule the other SUV's had a lot more bells and whistles (voice activated Navigation/Bluetooth, etc.), this SUV had the best performance, look, feel and room of the bunch, for the price. I love the power, the cabin is very nicely appointed. Everything is logically laid out and performs perfectly. I added the Bluetooth system, which works great with our phones. This is my third SUV and I am completely sold on Volvos after driving this one."
volvo,xc90,2006,Erica, 06/09/2006,Versatile SUV`,4,"I was skeptical about venturing back into an SUV, as my last SUV was a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which was a gas guzzler and fairly trucky ride. One test drive of the XC90 cured me of any concerns I had related to comfort. The XC90 handles almost identical to my S60, which was traded for the XC. Volvo did a great job of creating a functional, elegant SUV that does as good of a job hauling stuff as it does safely transporting our daughter. And all without sacrificing safety."
volvo,xc90,2006,Gary Howard, 10/16/2006,Awesome SUV,5,From the delivery from Neftin Volvo ( awesome dealership) the XC90 has been my favorite car ever.  Rides like a magic carpet and off roads like rhino.  I LOVE IT!

They were both great get away cars but neither were comfortable cars.  XC90 is just one extremely comfortable car to drive and I looked at Tourag seriously but it was little too small and I just couldn't risk VW's reliability.  I had 2002 GTI and was in shop every two weeks and lasted less than 2 yrs. My brother just bought new 2006 Passat.. stopped on next day of purchase.. Rear AC was not working and turns out vent was missing.  What a poor built quality.  Beware of VW!

The only major expense was replacing the timing belt @120,000 and airflow sensor.  I bought another car in the interim while saving for another XC90 and asked my son which car he wanted for his wife and new infant, he have a choice between our Honda Pilot and the XC90...He chose the XC90.  So, I am confident that he will at least be safe and comfortable. Just FYI I Only have to change oil once a year and the insurance is always between $600-$790 per year."

So far in less than 2 years of having the vehicle, there have been 5 recalls. We have had a dead battery requiring the vehicle to be towed (bad cell). We have had a rear wheel bearing go bad. Both of these occurred at under the 17k currently on it. Factory Pirelli Scorpion zero tires practically bald at less than 12k and replaced on my dime."

The heat was blowing hot and cold air which turned out to be a software problem.  It was also making a very annoying whirring noise, which we were told was normal for rack and pinion steering.  It finally went away after our last visit to the shop.  Gas mileage is poor.  Design on some of the dials aren't to great since they have little faint light indcators which are impossible to read in the sun(the fan level indicator, e.g.)  The trunk unlock feature is annoying, you can't just pop the trunk.

This year I decided it was time to return to Volvo's and purchased a 2006-XC90. It is not the Volvo I drove and loved for years!  I still like the safety aspects of the vehicle, but the dependability and feel are gone for me.  The cabin is loud and the ride is rough.  I had to have it  towed to back to the dealer two weeks after I bought it when it would not start.  I will not be a Volvo customer in the future.  The other premium brands have left them in the dust.

The battery had died because of a software glitch (they think) as described in a technical bulletin Volvo Int. put out.  Each time the vehicle has been in my garage and when I went to start it, nothing.  I love this car but am so disappointed in the reliability.  I also think for a beautiful SUV such as this is, and not a big mammoth SUV, it should get much better gas mileage.  Our local dealership has been great but it has been extremely inconvenient to have our brand new Volvo die.  I love the way it drives, handles, its comfort, but if I have another problem, I'm inclined to ask Volvo Int. to take the car back.  "

Ok, so I'm a stereo lover, and this car has the best stock sound system I've ever heard. The leather is meticulously sewn, the carpet is soft, the appointments are not over-done (as in the Tribeca), and the dash design is second to none. Oh, did I mention the third row seating and the fact that 5 of the 6 seats fold completely flat? Tribeca and Highlander aren't even in the same 'hemisphere' as the Volvo XC90. The Swedes get it plain and simple. One more thing...Volvo XC90 has lower depreciation than ANY CAR IN ITS CLASS."
volvo,xc90,2006,Bubba, 10/29/2005,"Great ride, safe people mover, FUN drive",5,"This is a well thought-out vehicle. You immediately feel in control and in pampered comfort. Quality, fit-and- finish, design...all above average. The V8 and tranny are smooth and work well together. Gentle purr of the exhaust pipes is subtle, but brings a grin to your face as you leave the others in your dust. MPG's are acceptable for the amount of weight (safety steel built-in) and 7- passenger roominess. Regular unleaded gas seems to work OK."

It's quiet and the sound system is wonderful.  I really like that my kids can watch a DVD and play a game at the same time.  Personally, this car out beats most of the SUVs of it's size.  It rides like a tank but has lots of power.  The body style isn't as classy as other SUVs but this car speaks... Sophisticated. I think we made a great purchase...one that will last us a long time."
volvo,xc90,2006,cj, 01/09/2006,really no problems,4,"excellent suv -- was initially concerned regarding some of the negative press that the xc90 received when it was first released; then, in talking with the salespeople, realized that majority of probs were engine related from the t6 which is no longer available. have had only one prob -- when driving the car at highway speeds, i heard a noise that i can only describle as a siren's scream. did some research, found out it likely was coming from the roof rack -- brought it in, fixed in 30 min. no other probs.  ife, for whom car was for, loves it -- very solid drive."
volvo,xc90,2006,FredMant, 01/21/2006,Much better than I expected!,4,"We bought this for my wife. I'm a BMW nut, but the X3 was too small and the X5 was just too expensive. I didn't even drive it until she picked it up. Now, when we go out, I love to take HER Volvo. I'm amazed at how peppy the 2.5 engine really is. The seats are as comfortable as the ones in my BMW 530i sedan, and I like the higher visibility. Heated seats work great, the climate control is easy to use and the stereo is great for a stock unit. FM and AM reception is far reaching and quiet. My only complaint is the drive around town gas mileage is a poor 14.5 mpg. On the highway, I can get about 19. We love the XC90. We got in silver with black leather interior, so it will look good for years!"
volvo,xc90,2006,kevin, 02/04/2006,exactly what I expected,5,"Dealer service not the greatest, but its not the cars fault. You dont have to fight the car at any time, you dont realize it weighs 4000+ pounds. Very solid but smooth feel, I think tire life will suffer. Reputation of longevity was deciding factor, I avg.18,000 - 22,000 miles per year. "
volvo,xc90,2006,JJ, 02/04/2006,Cramped Interior Space,3,"Nice quality materials...my wife loves it but she is 5'3"" tall and 110 lbs me on the other hand I am 6'1"" 215lbs I find the interior way to cramped especially for knee room...the ride is nice but I feel like I'm sliding off the seat due to poor side bolstering...the 2004 seats were better than the latest versions which changed in 2005...bad choice."
volvo,xc90,2006,Robb Arnst, 03/25/2006,The Best SUV I've Owned,4,"This is the best SUV that I've owned.  Previously I drove a 2000 Mercedes ML320, and the Volvo rides much better, more like a car than an SUV.  It has a good solid feel to it.  I'm 6'4"" tall, and I find the seats very comfortable.  The rear seat leg room is good, and the third row seats can actually be used by an adult.  Power from 2.5L engine is adequate, but it doesn't have as much 'pep' as my Mercedes, which I miss.  If you want more power get the V8 version.  I've been getting about 20 mpg on the highway.  The winter driving mode with the AWD is a nice feature.  I drove home in a substantial snow storm with no problems.  I looked at a lot of vehicles, and this is the best!"
volvo,xc90,2006,rr, 04/06/2006,Great V8-- a wonderful SUV--perfect for us,5,"After much dreaming and waiting for a VOLVO SUV, the XC90 does not disappoint. It's a comfortable, safe people mover that gives everybody a great ride (3rd row seats are higher for better views). The V8/6-speeds are mated nicely (purrs well!). Good snow traction and power here in the Rockies and for the highways on OE all-season tires (special winter tires were not needed). Love the split rear hatch and easy access throughout. Beautiful looking vehicle, great lines and finish. A solid and well built machine. Well designed and thoughtful interior. Easy to read dials and settings (although the radio is a bit clunky to set). We're going to get the Bluetooth installed next month. Great SUV. "

volvo,xc90,2006,Dennis Windmuller, 06/01/2006,DW,4,"Very impressive for a SUV - sturdy, good power, nice drive.  Quality interior & overall design - unmatched safety."
volvo,xc90,2006,WSB, 07/23/2006,Mostly great!,4,"This is our 6th Volvo, but not necessarily our favorite.  While the XC90 provides seating options that our V70 wagons and S70 and S80 sedans could not provide, the 2.5T engine is clearly underpowered for the weight of this vehicle.  Gas mileage is POOR and would have been worse if we had chosen the V8.  We love the safety features of this vehicle.  It handles well and is roomy enough for our passengers--- mostly children."
volvo,xc90,2006,Tony Swift, 07/27/2006,XC90 -The Best,4,I love the comfort and the road handling. The third row seating for the kids is great. 
volvo,xc90,2006,NHMan, 08/03/2006,Volvo XC90 V8,4,"Last vehicle was a 2004 Acura MDX. The XC90 has a better, with the V8, engine and transmission. Very comfortable with most of the controls in a good position. Only have 700 miles but have been averaging 19 mpg. Only driven it in the rain but the handling, while not sporty, is good. If you want a good overall SUV, this should be high on your list. Any BMW X5 will offer better handling and performance but doesn't have the cargo space."
volvo,xc90,2006,Jeff, 08/21/2005,Excellent buy after much research,5,"I just drove this vehicle home from the factory and just love it.  It is very solid, comfortable, and it looks fantastic!  I got 21 mph in my first 1000 miles and the Premium sound is outstanding.  I really like the power of the V8!  It shifts smoothly and handles very well.  Combined with the warranty and free dealer service, this was a very smart buy."
volvo,xc90,2006,C. Bennet, 08/23/2005,XC90 Quality,4,"The XC90 is a nice quality family vehicle.  It drives very smoothly.   There is lots of cargo space.  It is  a joy to drive and I feel safe.  Although, I find the gas tank too small and have to fill up more often than I would like to.  I also wish it would have a sunglass holder."
volvo,xc90,2006,eee, 09/07/2005,geatest suv,5,Everything is great about this car.  The only thing that I would change is better instrument lighting and more electronic gadgets like an Audi or BMW.  Kind of boring in that sense.  Solid vault like doors.
volvo,xc90,2006,Maria, 11/24/2005,Volvo XC90,5,"Great Driving performance. Does not swerve on slippery roads, snowy roads. Car has great shock absorbers . Smoother ride on country roads   "
volvo,xc90,2006,ga, 11/28/2005,"Had many, this is the best",4,"I have driven an audi, honda, hummer, ford, land rover, nissan and this is by far the best suv.  basic inside but great quality.  leather is awesome.  booster built in for my toddler and enough room for my baby car seat next door.  so safe and quiet ride.  head rests are great, can actually lean your head on them when you drive.  will buy another one in a few years.  not a single problem.  the leg room is the only downfall if you have car seats behind you, you lose some front leg room but it is fine, just on long trips sometimes i want to stretch more but that is it!  awesome!"
volvo,xc90,2006,M. Smith, 02/09/2006,Best SUV for your dollar,4,"Best fit and finish I have seen in an SUV.  We traded-in a 2006 Lexus RX330.  The quality of the Volvo is far better than the RX330. The 5 cyl. Turbo has more power than I thought.  Great seating, great interior quality, AWD seems to work fine.  The XC90 is the same price as the RX330. Once you drive and compare qualtiy and saftey the Volvo wins. The Volvo is built like a tank (solid doors, etc.) Lexus doors are light and dent very easy.  After owning the Lexus and Volvo, I feel the Lexus is over rated, and the Volvo is under rated.  Volvo XC90 is a great product. With 1,500 miles we average 15MPG (all city driving) the Lexus RX330 averaged 16MPG with 3,200 miles. Volo weighs 600lbs more."
volvo,xc90,2006,Eric H, 02/12/2006,Love it!,4,"Our family's first Volvo.  Bought it for my wife after she had a baby -- she's no longer able to drive her 2-seater convertible with the baby.  We both love it.  Smooth drive.  Very stylish.  Chose this SUV after test driving and strongly considering BMW X5, VW Touareg, and Range Rover.  Choosing the Volvo just seemed clear to us to be the smart choice, especially when it comes to safety and reliability."
volvo,xc90,2006,lh, 02/17/2006,Its so great!,4,"I can't say enough about this car. It is easy and fun to drive, is very safe, and feels like a sturdy well built car. I chose this car after driving several others in the same price range. This by far seemed like you were getting more ""bang for your buck"""
volvo,xc90,2006,V4Life, 03/20/2006,Excellent Vehicle,5,"In the past 10 years I owned 4 SUV's including this. I had LexusRx330,Acura MDX and Mitsubishi Montero Sport. I feel VOLVO XC90 is a great SUV. VOLVO has great product than Lexus. I love the DVD, Booster seat,Premium Sound system and excellent interior. Mine is 7 seater SUV. I am getting  on average 16.4MPG in the city and 24.6MPG in the highy way. Very stylish and fun to drive. I feel like driving a Sedan. EXCELLENT SUV, go for it."
volvo,xc90,2006,ViVa_Volvo, 05/26/2006,Viva Volvo,4,I have had the XC90 for 6 months now and it is very comfortable and easy to drive. Gas is not as bad as I thought...love it
volvo,xc90,2006,JB, 08/10/2006,Cool SUV,4,"This XC90 is my 2nd Volvo. I love stylish interior design, smartly engineered 3rd row seat besides excellent safety features. It's fun to drive in a highway from San Diego to San Francisco."
volvo,xc90,2006,jfd, 08/09/2006,"Love the car, Hate the tires!",4,"My husband surprised me with this car for Christmas.  I love it and I love all the safety features for it.  However, when I hit 10,000 miles my tires started making noises and after 3 trips to the dealer, they told me it was the Pirelli tires and they have had problems with them.  I would recommend the car but not the tires.  Also, if you have two carseats in the car then it is impossible for an adult to get to the third row without climbing over seats.  I agree that the inside door handles should not be plastic."
volvo,xc90,2006,RHV, 08/16/2006,Phenomenal Car...,4,"How often can one say that spending over $40k for an automobile was a good feeling and/or investment - although the safety of my three under 4 years old is worth $40k - not often.  The XC90 is one of these autos. This is my 3rd Volvo, and it is an incredible machine. The XC90 can best be defined in two ways: powerful yet understated or aggressive yet humble...BUY THIS CAR MOM AND DAD!"
volvo,xc90,2006,Pirates, 08/30/2006,2006 XC90 2.5T,4,"Great SUV. Enjoy driving and great for long trips. We test drove the BMW X5 but decided the Volvo XC90 was a great SUV for about $10,000 less. More cargo room, very safe, but needs a little bit more horespower but helps in gas savings (takes regular gas) compared to the X5."
volvo,xc90,2006,Michele, 10/14/2006,lMy first volvo-,4,"I waited 2 yrs for this car!  Needed the suv body style,  very happy with this!  A few minor problems (computer errors).  At 25,000 miles, had to replace tires.  Not happy about that. Was told its common on Awd suvs?!  Would like to know what other owners think about this.  "
volvo,xc90,2006,GFamily, 10/14/2006,Our experience,4,"We bought the car because we thought it would be useful, versatile, fun liked the design. We are not disappointed in any way and are happy with our purchase."
volvo,xc90,2006,Jeannie, 10/14/2006,Volvo XC90,5,My Volvo XC90 is my new favorite automobile. I am a very particular consumer who spends a great deal of time researching before buying a new auto.  This vehicle has been my most satisfying purchase yet.  I may never leave Volvo if they keep making this vehicle! It is everything a professional mom could want...both sexy and safe! I am considering a volvo for my son when he gets his lisence soon.
volvo,xc90,2006,Gerry Kirkpatrick, 10/28/2006,Florida Volvo XC90,4,I enjoy driving this vehicle and feel extremely safe in it  My only disappointment is in the gas mileage.  I traded in a Tahoe in perfect condition to get rid of the 8 cylinder engine only to get less gas mileage.  If I had know about the mileage I would have gone with the more powerful 8 cyl.Volvo as it had a smoother ride and more power on the road.
volvo,xc90,2006,flyingman, 07/24/2007,First Year Follow-Up,4,"This is a follow up to my first post in Aug 06 when car was new.  Just turned 10k miles and one year.  Absolutely nothing has gone wrong with the car.  Got a recall notice about the gas tank door and they fixed this during a routine service at 7,500 miles, but never suffered the problem. Took one long trip with 5 persons and gear.  It was tight but didn't want to put anything on the roof.  Added a hitch (not from the dealer!) and a great bike rack from softride.  We are still loving the car.  Mileage is in the 17-18 in the city and 22-23 hwy."
volvo,xc90,2006,Lorraine, 07/28/2007,Not reliable at all!,4,I love the ride but it has died in the middle of a busy intersection twice. It had to be towed back to the dealership and they replaced the fuel pump and we are waiting to see what they think it is this time. The driver's side beam has had to be replaced twice. The DVD system works intermittently. I thought Volvos were supposed to be dependable and safe. I have a 3 year old and I am going to have to get something else unfortunately.
volvo,xc90,2006,kyle, 03/31/2008,First and last Volvo,3,"Great car for the first couple of weeks. Then it would not accelerate. It took four trips to the dealer, and me having to drive the car for them. They had to change the fuel tank, and pump. Lots of noises and clunks, that they can't fix."
volvo,xc90,2007,Larry, 10/14/2006,2007 Volvo XC90 V8,5,"Traded a 2001 BMW X5 that I thought was the best until I test drove the Volvo.  So far, getting about 20 mpg with the V8...much better than I got with the 3.0 in the BMW.  Handles as well as the BMW since Volvo re-tuned the suspension in '07.  Great ride. The Dynaudio stereo with the Sirius is awesome."
volvo,xc90,2007,Joe, 12/05/2006,Absolutely love it!,4,"Bought the XC90 over the Lexus GX470 and Acura MDX.  Less expensive, better safety rating, better 3rd row seat configuration than Lexus; better interior features/finish and seemed more solid vehicle than MDX.  We have put 7100 miles on it in about 3 months and have really, really enjoyed it.  In- line 6-cylinder engine has plenty of power and fuel economy has been 22 mpg highway and about 18 mpg in town.  This is very good considering the weight of the vehicle and the performance it has on the road, acceleration, etc.  Also has great cargo room with the 2nd and 3rd row seats folded down."
volvo,xc90,2007,Dan, 11/28/2006,Best SUV I've Owned,5,"I just purchased a 2007 Volvo XC90 3.2. I was thinking about the V8 however I wanted better fuel economy. I was concerned that I would be sacrificing power (fun) for fuel economy. I didn't, this true SUV has power and is fun to drive. I know the V8 has more power but it is not necessary. I considered a Land Rover LR3. However I selected the XC90 based on the safety features as well as the ride. It is far superior to the LR3. If you need an SUV for getting around town and you want a comfortable ride for road trips then this is your automobile. It is also excellent in the snow so you can get to the mountains to do some skiing. I love it! Must have - Sirius satellite radio and running boards."
volvo,xc90,2007,Pmedhat, 08/19/2008,Solid,4,We have three XC90s in the family and the V8 is by far my favorite. The Yamaha engine never runs short on torque. The acceleration between 50-80 mph is amazing. The minor improvements to the interior are subtle but affective.  I especially appreciate the iPod jack. The handling is awesome with plenty of room for the family.
volvo,xc90,2007,Wesley Tarner, 09/30/2015,Love at first sight,5,"I absolutely love this car and would buy it a million times again. The seats are very comfortable and plush. The leather doesn't hold up as well as some others but its still comfortable. My Volvo lasted around 200,000k and then broke down. Had regularly maintained it, but it needed alot of work done to get it up and running again so i had top part with it. But i am looking for a newer one because i loved it soo much! I would recommend this car 9/10 (lost a point due to a few quirks such as low-tech compared to competition and also the common transmission issues).
"
volvo,xc90,2007,master_pate, 03/29/2012,My First Luxury Vehicle,4,"This was my first SUV, and first luxury vehicle in general. I bought it because of the look and safety features, and those have not let me down. This is one SUV I would keep forever except for the fact that I typically only get 14 MPG. I do almost exclusive city driving however."
volvo,xc90,2007,Debra Park, 01/05/2018,10 plus years of safety and comfort and still goin,5,"I bought the Volvo 2007 XC 90 in Feb 2007 after I was broadsided by another car in my Honda CRV. I will have the car for 11 years next month and except for cloudy looking headlights, it looks and drives like a brand new car. The only negative I can report is the Buffalo NY dealership has terrible customer service in their service shop. The suv is fabulous.

volvo,xc90,2007,prb, 11/29/2006,Buyer Beware,4,"We purchased this 2007 SUV in Oct 06, 1300 miles later, and 200 miles from home the water pump went out.  Volvo cannot get a part for three (3) weeks. We were left stranded with little or no support from Volvo.  Customer service is as worthless as the warranty.  Although, I rated the vehicle well, I would never, ever purchase another, simply due to the poor support from Volvo. In all fairness selling dealer did more than they had to and has tried to assist where they could.  Vehicle remains 200 miles from my residence awaiting a water pump."
volvo,xc90,2007,Jim Jackson, 08/30/2015,XC 90 is not quite what I expected from Volvo,3,"Bought car with 68 k miles, and later found out the front axles needed to be replaced.  I have 143 k and still haven't replaced them, but I have replaced two wheel bearings this year. Park assist went out, had it repaired, and within days the alarm would come on solid when backing and nothing close by. Had serpentine belt, tensioner and idler pull go out while on interstate.  Could barely steer enough to get it to dealership. Then the read assembly bearings failed about 5 months later.  Both repairs over 6K.

Other little nagging issues with hinge on center console breaking, etc.  Maybe it is my fault for buying a car with high mileage, but expected more from Volvo.
"
volvo,xc90,2007,Christine Farmer, 08/24/2015,Sadly Engine Scrapped,3,"I loved this SUV so much I retained the previous owners' name for her, Lucy.  She was great the first 3 years I owned her.  She rode well, was comfortable and I felt safe since I drive a lot of highway miles.   She has approximately 142,000 miles on her now.  Unfortunately, this year after a replacing the transmission and serpentine belt, for $3500, some strange noise began last week.  I drove her straight to my mechanic.  Here's what they told me:  inspect locking pin after removal, if locking pin is broken after removal, the shaft has worn into the bearing position, engine must be scrapped"".    Sadly, I dumped $3500 into her now will hope to recoup at least some of that selling her parts.

Squeaky center console that moans and groans with every turn. Vibrating turn signal wires in wheel well (fun 8 hour drive). Squeaky center console fixed second time. Vibrating turn signal wires identified after third try. Squeaky center console fixed third time. Radio decided to play half speakers for 6 hours (on an 8 hour trip). Rear windshield washer used -""I'm wet! whats happening?!""- dripped all over our 6 year old (inside the car, windows up, sun roof closed,  in her seat in the second row).  Leaked through the headliner. Still Squeaking! Joy!"
volvo,xc90,2007,TuNeRkId, 09/23/2008,OK,3,"We purchased our 07 XC in 2007 brand new. The truck has been OK , but not what I expected from a $45,000 car. It has good seat comfort and driving position but it also feels a lot bigger than it actually is. The car has decent acceleration, but nothing to write home about. The best thing about the car is the brakes witch stop you on a dime! The 3.2 our car has is a little bit thirsty and doesn't give as much power as I would like. Our average mpg (mostly city driving) is around 16.5 (on road trips we've gotten up to 22). The 3rd row seat is tight but easily moved out of the way! The transmission is great especially the manual option! Overall it has been a good car but could be better."

I am so happy driving my XC90, with 7 seats has room for everything and everyone, it is beautiful, is eye catching! I feel so safe when I am on the freeway, it takes the curves so easy, and it feels so smoth!...I love every single detail of the vehicle, but what I love the most is that it is so roomy in the inside, without being to big in the outside. In SF is not easy to find parking, and I always wanted a vehicle, that will be easy to park, but that will be big enough to carry my whole family and pet, and also that will be elegant and safe...I sure found all that in my Volvo!!"
volvo,xc90,2007,seXC90, 10/20/2009,My First Volvo,4,"This is my first experience with Volvo and for the most part it is a great one. The XC90 V8 is impressive and fun to drive. The styling of the exterior far out weights it competitors. I can no longer go back to the Japanese cars I drove in the past. They all now seem so cheap. I have had a few problems with my XC90: rattling noises (drive me crazy), front dash crackles during change in temperature (very common in Volvo's) but go away when temperature regulates and a strange transmission whine at 55 mph (being resolved). In Short I trusted the Japanese cars for their reliability, so that's why I chose the V8. Japanese (Yamaha)engine and transmission wrapped up in a luxury SUV. I love mine!!!"
volvo,xc90,2007,Dena, 12/28/2006,Love it!,4,"I traded in a 2004 Lexus RX330 for the 2007 XC90.  I love the way it handles and it feels much tighter and sportier.

This car is fun to drive!"

Especially now that Volvo has discontinued the V8 engine.  Big mistake.  Much better then the six at the expense of only a few MPG.  If your buying this for the MPG you can do much better.  If your buying this just for the pleasure, comfort and fun of the powerful V8, you'd be hard pressed to find something better.  Great world class vehicle.    "

I was afraid the 3.2 might be a let-down, but it has not been.  The six is completely adequate;  quick enough off the line and the passing lane. Shift points match the engine well at all speeds.  The XC90 is nimble for a two ton vehicle.  Very comfortable seats, well designed interior, quality materials throughout. A very satisfying purchase."

Traded that in for a 2007 V8 AWD, new, because I wanted a Nav system and I love the new Titanium Metallic Grey color with black interior.  2007 best of the lot and a Wednesday car built.  Powerful,smooth, comfortable, great sound system, excellent visabiltiy, fun to drive and solid as a tank. 6200 miles and no problems. Truly a world class vehicle.

volvo,xc90,2007,CarMan, 01/11/2007,The best SUV on the Market,5,"Having driven most of the SUVs on the market, the Volvo XC90 combines safety and comfort with ease of operation and a car like ride.  Not only does it's design allow for a roomy passenger and cargo compartment but as far as occupant safety there is no comparison with other SUVs on the market today. The vehicle is built on the large sedan platform so it gives you all the advantages of an SUV with the ride of a luxury sedan."

volvo,xc90,2007,W F, 11/25/2008,Love my XC90,4,"This was my first choice in SUVs. I absolutely love it. With 3 kids and after trading in the minivan, this suv is a little smaller.  But it is so much fun to drive (compared to the van it's like driving a sports car) that I don't mind the little amount of space lost.  It gets great gas mileage - the same as my van, 19 in town and 22-23 on the highway. It is easy to maneuver in small spots, easy to park. My only regret is that i didn't buy one sooner."
volvo,xc90,2007,M and H, 01/31/2009,Give credit to this is a excellent SUV,5,"Handle's great and very good safty evan in very bad weather, Big blind spot in backing up> A wow and beutiful style gets lots of looks and questions asked of it, Just drives great and wonderful in ALL weather, this is not an off road or a all so fancy SUV. Volvo is a safe, powerful and beutiful SUV. Good job Volvo. Gas MPG is much better than those other very High end SUV's. It is a keeper.."
volvo,xc90,2007,Carsten S, 02/23/2008,"Nice car, with a few shortcomings",4,"Overall, I am satisfied with the car. On many levels it compares well with other imported SUVs, and is more reasonably priced than many of them. The cargo room it provides is quite good. 2nd row seating is tight front and aft when the third row option is installed. Volvo has a very skimpy maintenance plan, comp. to others', just the first is free. Gas mileage:  try as I might, never more than 17mpg. A BMW X3 is much quicker and with beter mileage. Reliability:  the shift lever will not leave park on cold days for up to 1min.  Even a ""fix"" didn't help. Traction:  Problems with 4wd engagement led to recall, but mine still spins through in FWD on even just slightly wet surfaces. Very annoying"
volvo,xc90,2007,Sport model, 01/09/2007,Very Pleased,4,"Bought the car for my Wife.  We have 3 Children 7 and Under.  Had Minivan. Its my wifes car but I no longer dread driving her car. She chose the sport model which didn't break my heart.  Love the susp and wheels.  Great ride, tons of fun to drive, handles better than my maxima,  looks awesome(red).  Love safety features(essentially why I suggested to her). Downside is that it is not minivan which had tons of space, convenience for ingress and egress(obviously plus and minuses).  Thankfully she was ready for an SUV again.  Gas mileage fairly good, 18 mpg with the V8.  Love features, loaded with all but nav.  Seats are super, feel connected good ergonomics"
volvo,xc90,2007,Bill, 04/01/2007,Awesome Black Sapphire Metallic V8 Sport,4,"I love this car!!  Tested the 2007 X5 V8, MB GL450 and the Audi Q7.  This one had the best performance for the price.  Handles like a dream and has more than adequate power.  I'm not sure what a previous poster meant about not having auto locking and a compass.  I have both.  The auto lock is turned off from the factory, you just turn it on as per page 108 of the manual.  The compass is on my rear view mirror.  Test this one before you buy anything."

volvo,xc90,2007,Dino G, 11/15/2006,Excellent SUV,5,"Enjoy this vehicle quite a bit.  Spacious, comfortable with excellent seats.  Smooth I6 combined with 6sp tranny gives very good fuel economy for this kind of vehicle."
volvo,xc90,2007,Vic - Evanston, IL,From '06 T5 to '07 V8 Sport,4,"I bought an '06 T5 after driving a Honda Accord EX-V6 for 7 years and immediately fell in love with the Volvo fit and finish.  I originally wanted a V8 but thought the T5 would get much better gas mileage - wrong! Then I saw the V8 Sport on the road and knew I would have one soon.  What I didn't realize was how different the T5 and V8 Sport would be.  The growl of the V8 is awesome, the Sport exterior and interior is phenomenal, and all the extras from the Technology/Climate and Convenience packages are to die for.  Forget the others.  This is the vehicle I will drive everyday for the next 10 years or so, no matter the price of gas - it's worth it!"
volvo,xc90,2007,ltwxc90, 09/12/2013,XC90 Beats VW Touareg Hands down,5,"I have owned my XC90 now for 4 months and what a great SUV.
My last SUV was aTouareg and what a disappointment!
It was the worst!
It had a faulty transmission and when it would shift it felt as if the Whole car was going to break apart. VW Service was horrible, I would take it in and no one would do anything.
Even after having the Transmission replaced it still did the same thing.
My XC90 is great!
From its smooth ride to better fuel economy, Hands down it is the better car both inside and out.
The service I have received at my Volvo dealer is second to none.
I have owned a BMW and Mercedes and in this case Volvo service even beats those two! Great Job Volvo"
volvo,xc90,2007,Roy, 08/31/2006,Volvo XC90,3,"I recently bought an 2007 Volvo XC90 with the 3.2 6 cylinder motor.  I do not like the sluggishness of taking off from a stop sign, light, etc.  It seems also to handle like a bus, and not a sport utility vehicle."
volvo,xc90,2007,Volvo Lover, 10/17/2006,Greatest Car I've Ever Owned,5,I am in love with this SUV. I have had experience with SUVs before (Mercedes- Benz ML350) and this car is just as good or better and costs a little less. It is a beautiful and powerful car!!!

volvo,xc90,2007,RonP, 08/06/2007,Don't buy 6 cyl FWD,3,"We bought the XC90 3.2ltr FWD 7 passenger for its comfort and versatility when the grandkids visit.  We thought the inline 6 cyl would get decent gas mileage, at least better than the Explorer we had.  Wrong!  In town we are only getting 12-13 mpg as opposed to advertised 18.  Highway 22 mpg about what expected.  The 6 cyl is significantly underpowered - having to downshift constantly. Also the car has the most unintuitive controls, i.e., washer/wipers, door locks, headlight controls I've ever seen!  Must be Swedish logic!  It is a comfortable ride however for a mid-sized SUV."

volvo,xc90,2007,Marginmonster, 12/18/2007,More time in shop than on the road,3,"My wife and I purchased our 2007 XC90 3.2 in April of 07.  We have had multiple problems with this vehicle including a chronic rattle (5 weeks in the shop), a defective DVD entertainment system (almost caused a fire), improper oil change (1 1/2 quart low)and a stress cracked windshield / improperly installed from factory (took and act of God to get Volvo to take responsibility for). While the build quality of this vehicle and design of the XC90 looks good, we have experienced many problems that should not have occured in a vehicle in this price range.  We would not recommend Volvo and particularly the dealership we worked with."
volvo,xc90,2007,Very dissapointed, 06/21/2008,Likes the shop,3,"We trade in our 2006 XC90 to take advantage of a great offer on the new 2007 when it came out. Big mistake. We really liked our 2006 and only had minor issues with it. It drove well and was a good performer. Our 2007 has been a disaster. It has had a horrible ride since day one. It has been in the shop for almost 7 weeks in the first 18 months we have owned it. Both front axle shafts have been replaced, power steering issues along with numerous minor items. Even now, the car jolts over any bump and rides so loudly it is hard to talk in the car. At least it looks nice and we only have a two year lease. Volvo has tried to fix it, and the dealerships have been pleasant, but we give up."
volvo,xc90,2007,J G Stewart, 07/15/2008,Minivan with Ground Clearance,4,"My wife has extreme Volvo loyalty and  she bought this XC90 3.2 FWD straight base model in spite of my reluctance. I pondered a Kia Sedona, but couldn't bring myself to close the deal on that because I was doubtful the mpg would meet my minimum requirement. With my inaction going on indefinitely she bought this XC90, and I took her 2004 V70 base model with which I get 30 to 35 mpg on the highway at 70 to 80 mph under best driving conditions. The XC90 fuel use has been acceptable on the highway (22 mpg to over 26 mpg), but lower than I would like at 15 mpg in short trip usage in town.  Total fuel economy over the first 12,000 miles has been 19 mpg. "

I have ridden in other, so-called  more ""luxurious"" SUVs and find that they seem cheaply made, and plastic compared to the Volvo.

volvo,xc90,2007,K Engvold, 06/09/2007,Volvo XC90 - Wow,4,The part of my long commute that I simply love is the time I have to bond with my XC90. The power she has is awesome; the V8 is an absolute pleasure and provides the power that makes the XC90 actually feel like a sport car. The handling is so deceiving you forget you are driving an SUV. I have also witnessed Volvo being very attuned to improving this XC90 model over the years and I could not resist giving up my S80 for this XC90 as I have kept my eyes on  the XC90 for the last 5 years. The fuel mileage is acceptable at around 20 mpg with a Tornado fuel saver installed.
volvo,xc90,2007,twinmama, 09/16/2007,Never drive a minivan again!,4,"Love this car! Only complaint: mileage. I only get about 14.3 mpg. Other than that, spacious, great design, user friendly, great for kids and cargo. Love it. Will never go back to a minivan or station wagon again (unless it's another Volvo!!)."

Low noise, awesome seats, great driver position (nice and high). We love the two-piece rear gate as we have a dog who hops onto it as well as stays in on warmer days with the lower gate closed. main reason for buying was safety and looks. looked at BMW (X3 too small; X5 too expensive), Acura (tacky), Infiniti (weird), merc (unreliable?)."
volvo,xc90,2007,Patrobot, 10/11/2020,Could be much better,2,"Inexplicably noisy and unrefined ""luxury"" SUV. We have had a 2005 2.5T and currently own a 2007 3.2. The 2005 seemed to have been assembled better and the 2.5T produced low end torque this very heavy SUV needs. The 2007's Ford designed 3.2 inline 6 is unrefined, harsh and gutless as we discovered in an emergency. The AW 6 speed transmission seems to be shifting continuosly, the older AW 5 speed was better.The interior is a marvel of impracticality with virtually no useful place for items commonly used to be placed. The hard, thin plastic pieces used everywhere in the interior rattle and creak incessantly, the door panels rattling in synch with your favorite tunes. The center armrest frequently shatters at the hinge. The ride quality is very good and handling is great for a heavy vehicle. Accommodations are fair but a little cramped for 2 adults & 2 little kids, dad being 6'2"". As a longtime Volvo enthusiast it breaks my heart to find myself so disappointed with this vehicle. We hated our cheesy 07 Saturn Vue 3.5 v6 but I find myself nostalgic for the smooth, powerful Honda v6 and smooth 5 speed automatic."

We have 2 more payments to go, and can't wait to get out of this car.  I knew the car wasn't all that fun to drive, but was surprised that it would be as unreliable as it has been.  "

It's my third new car and the Volvo SUV by far is the best. If you aren't looking for fantastic gas mileage then this is the car for you. It's almost like being in a day spa, I have heated seats in mine and it's so nice in the winter time."
volvo,xc90,2007,Greg Robins, 04/06/2008,Good so far,4,"Just new to Volvo after driving Japanese for all my life (except Audi for a wonderful 3 years). Compared to previous MDX and 4-Runner, the XC90 has all the luxe one would expect at this price. Great seats, simple control-layout, great ride, decent power and capabilities. Low road noise and nice, high perch. Great grocery bag feature at back that beats a cargo net hands down. Handsome exterior design."

After test driving the 2007 XC90 and enjoying the drive I was hooked.  I am very happy with this car as it has more space than our family of four needs and it comfortably can take three of my children's friends.  If you are looking for an SUV with good gas mileage 19 MPG, all the safety and luxury features you will ever need, this is the car for you."

volvo,xc90,2007,First Volvo Owner, 09/29/2006,First Time Volvo Owner,4,"A very easy car to drive, switched from a small sports-sedan without any problems... Superb  interior quality. The controls are well designed and are easy to use. Feels safe inside. The new I6 3.2 engine performs well for a car of this size. Do not expect an X5 performance out of this car but the engine feels just right for this type of vehicle. Cant wait to take it for another drive. Overall I am very happy with the purchase. I needed a family car that would be fun to drive and at the same time accommodate 4 adults and 2 small children. I think I made the right choice. The other vehicle I looked at was 06MDX, which is a very solid SUV but it just did not feel like a $40K SUV."
volvo,xc90,2007,deb, 03/18/2007,The car that does it all,4,"I love this SUV - always wanted it for my family of four.  Finally got it!! Because this is our main car (the other being a rusty ""station"" car) it must covers all bases. And, it does so perfectly with its capacity for 7 passengers, plush and comfortable interior, all wheel drive, built in booster seat (gotta love it), safety features that Volvo is known for, decent mpg, and first class looks for a night out on the town. What else can you ask for? Really?"
volvo,xc90,2007,William, 03/16/2007,XC90 V-8 Sport; a unique SUV,4,"Only had it for a couple of weeks, but pleased with overall performance.  Outstanding looks with Sport Package and 19"" wheels.  Love the two-tone sport seats, suspension, Yamaha built V-8, Sirius satellite radio, etc.  Surprised that at $ 51,145 list that there's no compass as standard equipment and no auto locking of the doors when the vehicle is in gear.  I think the Ford bean counters are beginning to have an effect on Volvo."
volvo,xc90,2007,Xavier, 03/13/2007,Love this truck,4,"I bought this car in January and what a treat to drive.  Rides smoothly, it is super comfortable and it is super quiet on the highway.  Mileage on the highway is phenomenal (better than my 4cyl Nissan Altima - not as good in the City but as good as a 6 cylinder sedan.  The interior is better than most SUVs - far better than the X5 and the Cayenne.  Test drive and compare - you will not be disappointed.   Great value for the money. "
volvo,xc90,2007,Nice!, 05/14/2007,Nice!,4,"Just bought the XC90. Last car was the Acura MDX. Really enjoying the Volvo but do miss some of the nooks and crannies of the MDX for eye glasses, cell phones, loose change etc. Would also say the Acura had more of a luxurious feel on the inside. But, putting those things aside, the Volvo drives like a dream, definitely a tighter ride and handles better than the MDX and the interior is still very very nice. "
volvo,xc90,2007,Sue, 06/02/2007,Not what I expected,4,"The interior is a little tight with small amount of shoulder room. Same for cargo area, deep but not wide. Standard audio system really poor. Has no bass sound and cannot be upgraded without a huge expense. Recommend you don't even consider buying it without the AWD."
volvo,xc90,2007,VolvoDriver, 06/02/2007,Nice Ride,4,Enjoy every bit of this car.  Handles better than the 2003 S60 we owned prior to this purchase.
volvo,xc90,2007,Eric Burnette, 08/14/2007,Volvo Experience,4,"Quality construction, great reliability, excellent acceleration, eye catching design, only the Cayenne can compare (exterior design). Improve stereo sound quality (lacks richness and depth). Interior functionality (design, seats, storage, cupholders, tailgate) is genius, spartan in an exquisite sort of way. No wasted electronic frills, paint quality is superior, braking exceeds expectations. Lives up to the Volvo name and tradition."
volvo,xc90,2007,Sweet Ride, 09/07/2007,Sweet Ride,5,"Since I purchased the wagon 45 days ago, I have put 3,000 miles on with no problems.  The wagon runs smooth and quiet with power when needed.  This is the first V8 I have purchased so I had to get used to the reduced gas mileage. There should be no expectations for great gas mileage with a 5,000 pound vehicle.  Design, fit and finish are unmatched.  This is my 3rd Volvo I have purchased.  If the design and quality continue, I can see myself hooked for life."
volvo,xc90,2007,Shane Brossette, 10/16/2007,Fuel pump failure,4,"My XC90's fuel pump failed at 8000 miles! Volvo replaced the fuel pump, filter, and fuel tank. This was very unsettling and frustrating so early in my ownership.   "
volvo,xc90,2007,jane, 10/30/2007,My XC90,4,I saw this car at a dealership and bought it as a birthday gift for myself. First Volvo and I love to drive it. The V-6 has plenty giddyup on the interstate. The third row seats give you flexibility and stows away nicely with a cargo mat when not in use. The XC is large enought to get the job done and stylish enough to look good doing it.
volvo,xc90,2007,Lily, 09/24/2020,Still going strong with almost 190.000 miles.,5,"My Volvo XC90 has been a very reliable car. I drive a lot and put on 188.000 miles so far with regular maintenance only.  3 sets of tires and one set of each brakes, spark plugs, and a set of shocks. At 110.000 the belt idler/tensioner and belt was replaced as prevention only. Everything else works just fine. Interior held up very well. Not much wear on seats. Pulling a trailer is just amazing. Now dog tailing and hair rising events. I would buy one again in a heart beat.
"
volvo,xc90,2008,04silverado, 12/02/2012,Over 40k miles,4,"I purchased my 3.2 AWD with 22k miles when it was two years old.
I have since put about 45k miles on it.
What repairs have I done?
Only one thing that I can think of besides brakes and tires.
An emissions pump.
I consider one repair outside of maintenance in almost 70k miles acceptable.
Because of it's weight if you drive aggressively expect it to eat brakes and tires and gas mileage to be in the teens.

The original Pirellis had to be replaced shortly after I bought it because they were worn out.
I put Sumitomos on it and have yet to replace them with over 40k miles.
I do a pretty even mix of city/highway driving.
I anticipate getting another year (15/20k miles) out of them."
volvo,xc90,2008,Laura, 07/23/2008,I Love This Car,4,"I got this car mostly because I needed a change from my previous black MDX and black RX300. I got the passion red V8 Sport because it looked terrific and drove nicely on the test drive. I love this car because 2 months after I got it I was in a collision (head on with air bag deployment) with my two toddlers and elderly parents on the way to my daughter's birthday party and we all walked away with a few minor bruises. The tow truck driver and police officers all said to me ""thank God you were in a Volvo."" The dealer made my car perfect again and I love it more than ever."
volvo,xc90,2008,jero72, 11/11/2010,Beware of transmission issues,3,"As represented by MANY blogs, transmission failure is very wide- spread issue. More surprising is the repeat replacement issue. Vovlo doesn't seem to be concerned as there is no public discussin regarding design or manufacturing changes, even for the new models. I fully believe the only reason Volvo has not recalled the vehicle for faulty trany (replacement) is because they haven't been able to link fatalities to the issue. Based on what I am reading and what I am hearing, its only a matter of time. I am very surprised the Luxury Car manufacturer has not taken a more proactive position on this and dealers are very difficult to work with."
volvo,xc90,2008,2xvolvoowner, 05/16/2012,Was a Volvo Family,2,"We own both the XC90 and S60and have been frustrated with both.
In the XC90 past two years, we have collectively had to repair or replace numerous parts and sensors that seem trivial to have to get fix in such an early life of a vehicle. For example, the ignition switch had to be replaced.
The right and left side of the seat panel had to be replaced because the plastic cracked. The sunroof leaked. This doesnt cover all the other issues of the S60.
Without exaggeration, this is the most we have ever been inside of a service station. We have written to Volvo to share our concerns and got back a get lost attitude. We will never buy another Volvo. Shame on them for their response."
volvo,xc90,2008,Rawas, 10/26/2010,recommended,4,"The xc90 is an excellent suv for people looking for design, build quality and durability. It has a special scandinavian character that puts it far ahead of other suvs. volvos are famous for thier safety,practicality and longevity. Built like a tank, with one of the most sophisticted premium audio system installed in cars.If you are looking for muscles and performance, this suv is not for you."

No problems!  Perfect size......spacious inside, 3rd Row if you need it / lots of cargo room if you don't.  2nd row slides fore and aft to adjust legroom where it's needed most.  Excellent interior materials and quality.  Drives like a dream.  Yamaha-built 4.4L V8 is a ROCKET and has tons of passing power, but will get 22-23 mpg on the highway if you set the cruise at 60-62mph.  Yes, this is AWD:)  Handles rock solid in the snow if you put snow tires on it.  Great car.......we're definitely buying it at the end of the lease"

All nice, well built autos, but when you sit in the XC90, shut the door and drive you feel safe and comfortable. Controls are well layed out and everything is easy to use. No useless extras in the dash to ""play"" with. It has a solid feel on the road, either 4 lane interstate or two lane back roads. Recently took an 800 mile round trip and averaged 22 mpg. Not bad for going 75 to 80 mph. "

This vehicle drives like a fine tuned sports car and grips the road like velcro. The vehicle is a real head turner going down the road and at traffic lights.  Dynaudio is the best. Navigation is OK, but could be a little better with response times. I have missed a turn or two when driving. I am a bit surprised that some of the interior plastic decor parts (pieces that cover some of the metal have fallen off and the middle console is loosey goosey when you go to store something away.

volvo,xc90,2008,scatback, 12/22/2009,Great car needs better tires,5,"20,000 trouble free miles in the V-8, average 19.7 mpg in mixed driving.   Love the premium leather, the drive train, the ride and quality and the looks.    But Volvo shouldn't build a all wheel drive car with the 19"" Pirelli Scorpians.  They are useless, not to say dangerous, in even light snow, got real noisy after 15,000 miles and were ready for scrap after 20k.  I've replaced the with Conti HDC's, which are stock on Mercedes.  My only other complaint is the turning radius that resembles a super tanker (supposedly to accommodate the width of the V-8); we call ours the ""Queen Mary"". "
volvo,xc90,2008,Chris, 06/09/2008,Great Car/Terrible Mileage,4,"My wife has always wanted the XC90, so we took the plunge when the lease on our Pathfinder was up. It's a beautiful car, and we've owned Volvos all along growing up. From a comfort standpoint, the car is top notch. More interior room than the Pathfinder.  Powerful stereo system. It was good to get the familiar Volvo safety I've been used to over the years. Only problem, the gas mileage is horrible. We're aveaging 14.8. But hey, what do you expect for a car that is ""dripping"" in safety features, that's more important  Also, had to drop some paperwork at the dealership one day and something punctured my tire as I was driving out, they reimbursed me for the new tire!"
volvo,xc90,2008,eastcoastjim, 09/08/2008,My 2nd XC 90 - 2008 V8,4,"We leased our 2nd XC 90 in August 2008, and couldn't be happier. Our first lease was a 2006 XC 90 with the 5 cyl. turbo, and it was a mediocre performer. Way underpowered, it worked so hard all the time it got horrible gas mileage and forget trying to get it to do a 50 to 70 pass on the highway. It had some warrenty work, but none of the horror stories I have read elsewhere.  Based on the improved reliability cited by consumer's reports, we decided to lease a new V8. It is light years better - it feels like a completely different car, and the gas mileage is about the same between the two.  There are only minor differences between the model yrs, and the incentives made them the same price!"
volvo,xc90,2008,birdman, 11/13/2008,Great value for money,4,"I've now driven almost 2200 miles with my XC90 3.2. No mechanical or other problems. The ride is a bit stiff but that does help the handling. Overall, it is an easy to handle car, but one does notice it is big and heavy. The AWD keeps it on the road all the time and it doesn't flip/ flop turning corners as much as other SUV's. But it does a bit the tendency to go straight when turning corners, probably based on it being a primairily FWD based car. The 3.2 is a nice engine, with enough power to handle the car and a full load of passengers and luggage. I can imagine with the weight of the car that the V8 would be a lot nicer to drive, although the mileage will be even worse. "
volvo,xc90,2008,20K+, 04/24/2009,20K+ and Still Liking it,5,"I've driven the XC90 for 20K+ miles still love it. Mileage is almost always over 20. Trips - Norway/Sweden 1,700 miles - 23.8 mpg. Upper Midwest 2,400 - 23.4 mpg. New England - 3,400 miles 23.7 mpg.  Amazingly good mileage. Comfort can't be beat.  Have had ZERO problems, not even one repair trip to the dealer.  It will be a long time before I trade-in this car.  "
volvo,xc90,2008,Stevepei, 02/17/2009,Fun to drive and look at,4,"I was going to buy a Lexus RX350 but told the salesman that I had another appointment at the Volvo dealership that morning. I would most probably come back to close the deal with him after the appointment.   After a test drive of Volvo XC90, I changed my mind right away.  The car felt smooth, sturdy, and macho, having an excellent road grip at highway curves.  I have driven the car for almost 5 months since then and never had a problem with its workmanship.  Believe it or not, it is also a head turner on highway. One major complaint I have about the car is gas mileage, so far I have 14.8 m/g.  Another complaint is its slow acceleration, but I have learned to live with that. "
volvo,xc90,2008,sdd, 10/26/2008,Way Overpriced,3,"We bought the XC90 after owning a Suburban to get a smaller vehicle, a ""luxury"" SUV, and for the safety features.  The safety features are there, but this SUV is not a sturdy vehicle for active families. The middle console has come out, the doors do not automatically lock/unlock, it rattles, the seats in the back rows are difficult to lay down-just to name a few of our complaints.  For the money, we regret we did not purchase the Lexus or the Land Cruiser.  "
volvo,xc90,2008,nicolo, 10/15/2008,Best in class,4,"The CX90 is in a class by itself. I drove the 08 MDX (I've owned two), but the  V-6 labors, it's  still  only a five speed, the ride is harsh, and the wind and road noise are too high. The BMW X-3 is a teetering joke, the X-5 3.0 is underpowered, the 4.4 overpriced, besides which  the  controls  are needlessly quirky, the navigation screen miniscule, and the 'leather' looks and feels like 2nd rate plastic.  How do they sell those things? The Volvo leather on my premium is sumptuous, the materials and design are great, and the ride responsive but quiet with no wind noise.  In short, It's a great ride.  And the lease was the same as the the MDX for a car that stickers for 10k more. "
volvo,xc90,2008,Fuzzball, 02/02/2009,Solid SUV,4,"We leased this SUV after 7 leases of Volvo cars before it. We had outgrown any car they make and this is a perfect fit. Lots of room, extra row of seats, (not much room there) and all the emenities needed. The ride is solid, plenty of room for me, (6'2'') amd a son of the same size. The premium sound is great, there is more than enough power to enter the highway safely and easily, braking is solid also. Car looks great, very reliable and lots of room in the back for luggage and whatever you pick up at Home Depot. The leather seats are as comfortable as at home, heat is great, have yet to do a summer with the black leather interior, but we are not concerned."
volvo,xc90,2008,bobliles, 09/20/2007,Scandinavian Delivery,5,"We picked up the car at the Volvo delivery center in Goteberg, Sweden and drove to Oslo, Lillehammer, over the mountains to Balestrand, back through Sweden, Karlstad, Stockholm, Kalmar.  Climbing the mountains was no effort for the V8 and was unaffected by the altitude.  We drove 1700 miles in ten days. The only challenge was parking in an Oslo underground garage meant for the dimunitive European vehicles.  Mileage for trip was 23.8 mpg which is excellent considering the mountain and in city driving. But minimum octane in Norway/Sweden was 95. I've been a Honda/Acura owner for 30 years. Owned an MDX and test drove a new MDX recently.  The Volvo XC90 is the ultimate. "
volvo,xc90,2008,scatback, 08/30/2010,Stranded,3,"At 33k, the car overheated and stranded us.  Picked it up from the dealer after two days, happened again.  Twice on the hook in a week.  That follows 3 days in the shop for a steering angle sensor, and another day for a headlight.  The 4.4 is great, the ride is quiet, the interior is designed for adults.   But we've driven 800,000 miles in Acuras and Infinities and never been left on the side of the road.  It's happened twice in our low mileage XC90 in a week.   Plus, no rearward vision and primitive electronics.  We're going back to MDX"
volvo,xc90,2008,Lars Hoej, 06/16/2008,Love it!,4,"My fourth Volvo, but SUV. A 2008 V8 Special Edition with practically all options. Paid $56,000 and have no regrets. The ride is smooth, steering responsive and road grip and stability far better than my wife's Acura MDX. Second row a bit cramped, but as it is meant for kids and they are more interested in the entertainment system, it's not a big issue. Air condition for the rear seats is on all the time, as it enhances the over-all airflow. The air quality system and BLIS makes highway traffic very comfortable. I drive the car pretty hard and has a mileage below 12, but the V8 sound is so great that it's hard not to use the power.  "
volvo,xc90,2008,Lucy Boudet, 10/29/2008,"""Volvo for Life"" Great Motto",4,"This is my 2nd XC90. Came out of a great experience in a 2005 XC90 and couldn't find anything I really wanted better. Tested a Mazda CX9, Mercedes M Class, Subaru Tribeca, Highlander, Lexus RX 350...and on and on. It may not have the fun ""zoom-zoom quality of the Mazda, but the Mazda outside mirrors vibrate like crazy...rear seats vibrated...tracks in the floor looked so cheap. Mercedes was nice but didn't like the paddle shifter and it's too small cargo area.  Volvo makes the most beautiful, classy looking SUV. Nothing beats the feeling of quality in my XC 90. This new engine drives great. I thought I'd miss the Turbo. Not at all. Great lease deals make it the perfect family vehicle. "
volvo,xc90,2008,RD, 04/14/2008,Good Deal for the Money,4,"We came out of a BMW X5 4.4 and couldn't be happier. Performance is the same, ride is sporty but not as stiff; we pretty much got this thing loaded and got a free Garmin Nav unit as well. Ended up with the V8 because we didn't feel the 6 cyl could do the job. Fuel economy in 600 miles of in- town driving around 16.5 mpg; pretty good for a heavy car. The biggest thing for us was keeping the same size SUV and getting more interior room and with the 3rd seat down, there is plenty for her and the baby's stuff. We got ours at the end of the month and after negotiating, they practically gave this thing away. Get the Executive pack with different leather and the blindspot info deal; worth it. "
volvo,xc90,2008,Chief1, 01/03/2009,2008 XC 90 is Great,4,Great car.  Enjoy the comfort of the ride.   The Sirius radio is a great addition.   The SUV lacks armrests for rear passengers.  Lack of the armrest is huge disappointment. Lack of armrest made our rear seat passengers uncomfortable.   I cannot understand why developers did not include rear seat arm rest for passenger. The styling is great.  The car is eye catching.  The performance of the front wheel drive is great.   Numerous safety features are available.  
volvo,xc90,2008,Zack, 02/11/2017,2008 Volvo XC90,3,"Bought an xc90 because of appearance, tall trunk space, and clearance what modern suvs compromise. The vehicle is ok nothing special. Interior is cheap quality, leather wears easy, and trims fade quick. There is nothing luxurious about this car. Drives fine, for a heavy car the acceleration and fuel economy is poor, gets stuck in snow easily defeats the entire purpose of ground clearance and the transmission has sloppy shifting and when driving on highway does have a few sweats and rattles. Only good thing about the car is safety and cargo space

volvo,xc90,2008,Shane, 12/13/2018,Bad Transmissions,1,"Bought a used 2009 Volco XC90. After extensive research found out there are major transmission problems with a lot of their vehicles from around 2008 and back. Worse yet, the cost to have it replaced or repaired is extremely high. Anywhere from $3000 to $7000. There was a class action suit on their vehicles with T6 transmissions.  The valve body alone is $1000 just for the part. Regret buying mine but fortunately I know how to do a lot of major work and have no choice but to plow through getting mine fixed.  Just read many of the Volvo transmission forums on the internet and you'll see the extensive problem that exists.

Stop crying about fuel economy, put your family in a Prius if that's important to you, if you want a truly safe, well built, nice looking SUV this is the truck for you!  Remember you get what you pay for, there's a reason that this truck is over $50,000 without things like navigation and rear view cameras, because you are paying for safety!

volvo,xc90,2008,Douglas Pavlak, 06/23/2018,Rugged Swede,5,"Volvo packs a lot in their packages for much less money than other European manufacturers. The car is rugged. After 10 years, not a speck of rust.  The interior is still gorgeous and the stereo terrific. The newer models (we just bought a new XC 90) are even better and obviously more up-to-date. They pack more performance in terms of engine power, handling etc., commensurate with the competition. I still think they give you the biggest bang for the buck (not to mention any German competition by name).

Very simple process to custom order the vehicle from the factory and saved nearly $9K over state-side MSRP. Zero mechanical or quality issues since it arrived 8 months ago.  Incredibly versatile SUV for my family of five- we've used a variety of seating configurations for different trips, extra guests etc.  Very quiet at standstill and on highways and a nice sound to the inline 6 when you step on it. I had driven the V8 version several times before and it is more fun, but I couldn't justify the extra cost and I've never felt I absolutely needed the extra power. One of the best family vehicles out there."

volvo,xc90,2008,Bruce Johanson, 12/23/2018,Bought as Replacement,4,"Little things such as the ""clock spring"" device (located under the passenger seat) had to be replaced at 89,000 miles, but this was covered by warranty. The tire pressure sensors need replacement now...dashboard light is on and tire pressure is fine. We bought this vehicle sight-unseen and it was delivered to us.  It was a replacement for our Cadillac SRX that was wrecked. There is no comparison...the Volvo is THE car for us.  The Caddy liked to use to use oil...the Volvo requires no added oil between changes and the fuel mileage is a bit better. One little criticism....the turning radius of the XC90 is greater than a 2000 XC 70 we had previously, so it requires a wider swing to get into tight parking areas, certainly something we can live with. We are still very pleased with the Volvo XC90.  We also had an idler pulley bearing seize which required replacing the serpentine belt. This required removing the air conditioning compressor to get at things. Otherwise, the car is easy to service....I do my own oil changes and routine maintenance. Two years into owning it and the car is still tight and rattle free. We now have 116,000 miles on it and the only problem thus far is the above mentioned idler pulley and belt which was replaced by a local shop.  Unlike previous Volvos, this one is much easier on the tires. We bought the car used and the tires were not new and they have worn down evenly with still at least 40% tread left. We will probably stcik with the bran of tires the car came with and we know we will have to replace the tire pressure sensors

It drives, but constantly in the shop for several issues, including AC problems, allignment issues, electronics, mechanical, and at one point, they had to replace both front axles completely!  Don't be fooled by the safety recommendations, all newer luxury SUV's have good overall safety ratings. Further, the car has horrible traction control in rainy conditions.

Acura MDX was more luxurious and had better bells/whistles, reliability, but lease deals were poor. Only stripped down MDX was offered as a deal, but adding options was costly! BMW X5 - too small and clunky doors- wife hated it! Man's car. Lexus RX was wonderful, but too small for our needs. Volvo has best safety record, but scary reliability.

Volvo has the most comfortable seats in the business. Gas mileage has been decent at an average of 17.5-18.5 mpg in mixed local driving. This is better than my previous Ford Explorer V-8 (16.5-17.5) & my friend's 6 cyl XC-90.  The steering is a bit lighter than I would like, but handling is crisp.

I'm surprised that there are not more reviews on this car because we really love ours.  Our '08 was t-boned by a driver who ran a red light.  I had my two children (5 & 9) in the back seat & none of us suffered any injuries.  The other driver totaled his car & suffered from whiplash & minor back injuries.  This car is a tank!  That's why it does not get very good gas mileage, but I don't mind trading A+ safety for a few more dollars at the gas pump.

True, it's not really made for hauling 7 adults all the time, but it gives us the flexibility to throw a few extra kids on board for outings.  Other than that, we find our R-design 3.2 to be classy, fun to drive, we get a lot of compliments, etc.  You get luxury and a certain degree of performance as a bonus to safety and versatility.

There's not too much room in the front for the driver and passenger.  At 14,000 I already needed a wheel alignment which is not covered. Also I had problems which needed service on the drivers side chair as well as indicator lights going off on the dash board for no apparent reason. After one year, I'm looking to trade the vehicle in for a SUV that gets better gas mileage.  This SUV consumes gas like I consume beer."

The safe and sound warranty is great. All service including oil,brakes rotors, wear and tear etc (except tires) are covered for 5yr/60k 91 octane is recommended but hard to find so I use 93. You can use 87 but I notice a lack of power with the 3.2 engine. Overall, I love this SUV. It is sharp looking and safe. No new design appears in the works until 2012."
volvo,xc90,2010,hook'em, 03/05/2010,good choice in mid size SUV category,4,"I bought this primarily because I believe, based on an in-depth research, it is the safest SUV around.  I looked at the data behind the NHSA and IIHS's ratings in addition to some detailed rollover test results from something called JRS rollover test.  I might have taken this safety stuff a little too seriously.  However, looking beyond just the readily available ratings (which, in my opinion, would incorrectly indicate that other SUVs are just as safe as the XC90) revealed that Volvo's safety reputation in this case is well deserved.  Other pluses: The interior is functional and flexible for our family of 4 (plus grand parents) and to my eyes, this SUV looks better than the others."

volvo,xc90,2010,lhos315, 11/26/2010,Nice Car - Couple concerns,4,I've had the car about 8 months. I replaced a minivan w/very squeaky brakes. I was disappointed that within a couple months the brakes were already squeaking in this car. I've had it in the shop a couple of times but they have not been able to fix it. The ride is a little stiff as has been mentioned. The V8 is great with a lot of power. I got the nav package and this system is pretty poor. The rt traf is helpful but this system can't find big time retail stores without typing in an exact address. I wouldn't rec buying this nav system. I too have experienced the buzzzz in the speakers which hasn't been fixed. Does anyone know what this is? Overall a good/fun/safe car to drive around
volvo,xc90,2010,harcherdl, 12/31/2009,New Buyer,4,"We just bought our AWD XC90 and are very happy so far.  Reviews of the add ons (like NAV and entertainment packages) helped us decide not to purchase these features.  The safety features are unparalleled, especially at this price.  If feels like you are driving a real vehicle instead of a plastic toy.  Ride is smooth and much quieter than the Durango SLT Plus we traded in.  5 yr wear and tear, 5 yr maintenance, and 5 yr warranty were great bonuses.  Costco buyer's program, and the 2009 tax incentives sealed the deal for us."
volvo,xc90,2010,vmfromtx, 01/25/2013,Mold Smell in A/C system & Low Oil Level Warning,3,"I bought my CX90 New and have owned it for over 2 years.

My Volvo XC90 has an annoying issue. When I turn on the A/C, for the first 30 seconds, bad mold smell comes, and then I don't smell it. Reported to the dealer on 4 different occassions. They supposedly did everything ehey could, but the problem still persists.

Recently, at 58000 miles, suddenly ""Low Oil Level"" sign came up. When I cheked the dipstick it was below minimum. Dealer supposedly checked it and found no oil leaks and says that they must not have put enough during the previous oil change, and that Volvo does eat some oil between service. I will have to monitor the oil level to see if there is a problem."

I did not think that the model could get any better but my latest VOLVO XC90 is spectacular!.  The Executive Model's interior is outstanding.  I feel like I am sitting in my family room.  The handling is ""tight"" and feels like a sport car within a SUV. The safety features are a plus when insurance premiums are due.

volvo,xc90,2010,AusTXGK, 03/07/2010,4 Months Driving Experience with XC90,4,We purchased the Volvo XC90 in November 2009.  We replaced a 2004 Ford Expedition in order to downsize and gain a little better fuel economy.  Pros:  The interior and exterior quality and styling of the vehicle is excellent. The leather seats are the best quality/most comfortable of any vehicle I have owned.  The vehicle is exceptionally quiet and drives very smoothly at cruising speeds. Cons:  The acceleration of the vehicle is a little jerky from start to about 30 mph.  It is very noticeable as the vehicle's automatic transmission shifts gears.  I think the 6 cyl standard engine is a little undersized for this vehicle.  Also the gas mileage is disappointing at average 20 MPG (17 MPG city).
volvo,xc90,2010,david, 12/05/2009,just purchased,3,"After an exhaustive look at a range of cars from the 4 Runner to the Range Rover Sport we settled on the XC90 and I think we got what we expected. An ok vehicle that has an appealing look but it's not flashy, and the interior is nice but creature comfort is lacking. What sold us was the relatively decent price for the number of features and the 5 yrs of free maintenance. We also like the spacious interior and the 3rd row seats are nice to have if needed and space is not compromised, although the 2nd row is a little tighter than some competitors. I'm 6' but could still sit there comfortably. This SUV will be a fill in for a few yrs until something in this $ range gets us excited.  "

Dissapointments: the vehicle was delivered to DC/VA almost four/five weeks behind scheduled arrival date with wrong interior color (calcite seats...ouch...), my speakers are making weird bzzzz sound. I installed bluetooth and portable 'Garmin for Volvo' navigation system and I am pleased with both. I especially like the portable navsystem, because you can use it with other vehicles;saves you $ when you rent on vacation. I really like how it handles the bumpy DC/VA roads and that there are no blind spots like in other SUVs. Also, the free service plan on 2010 models is a MAJOR perk!"

Except in my Land rover LR2 2010  which was replaced at 36K miles by dealer. The only reason I purchased a land rover is because it is fitted with same drive parts as my volvo.

It definitely was and I love everything about it.  The gas mileage is great for an SUV. The interior is awesome with no major blind spots like other SUVs in its class. Plus the price is much better than other luxury SUVs. I purchased a true base model, since the base has leather and sunroof. Those are the two huge features I wanted on my SUV.  Even thought it is a V6 it has a lot of power. It gets up and goes. The brakes are also fantastic. Great SUV would purchase again and recommend to a friend."
volvo,xc90,2010,Bonamarte, 10/08/2020,10 year old report,3,"I bought an 2010 XC90 used, had 100k miles on it.  Only defect was the wear and tear on the front leather seats, they are completely worn out with cracking and fading, but still in one piece.  Some observations of the car at this age:

1.  Gas mileage is actually decent for an old, heavy SUV. I am getting 19/20 with the standard V6.

2.  Oil Level Sensor is very sensitive.  7.8 quarts is recommended, I usually put a full 8 quarts in.  It burns oil very slowly, so the light will come on mid-oil change, even though it's still in the dipstick range.  I usually go ahead and top it off with another half a quart.

3.  There's a weird auto fan feature with the AC, previous owner warned me of it.  If you leave the AC on when you shut off the car, it tries to circulate air while you're away.  The problem is if the car sits for a several days this way, you'll kill the battery.  You have to remember to shut off the AC when the car is parked for awhile.  And, since the battery is in the back of the car, you'll have to crawl in from the front to change it if there's not enough power to unlock the tailgate.

5.  A few items like seatbelt latches and keyless entry have not stood well with the test of time.  Best to double check those locks before you walk off trusting that all 4 doors are actually locked.

6.  Mechanically, the car is great for 10 years old.  No leaks anywhere, clean engine, runs well.  I would recommend buying one used if you find one with low miles.

volvo,xc90,2010,Kimberly, 03/24/2019,9 years with Volvo,5,"Overall this was great car.  I bought this car a smart single mom/soccer mom car.  We traveled and lived in this car everyday.  We have rear entertainment, third row seating, heated front row seats and a bench middle seat that all folded flat for carrying snowboards, bikes, camping gear.  My least favorite was the middle and third row seats.  The middle seats sat STRAIGHT up which is not a normal position and there was no back reclining.  Lots of compartments for storage of everything you could think.  Now resale, parts and value are very poor.  This gentlemen was texting and driving and ran into the Volvo while I was at a complete stop. Insurance is already saying the vehicle will probably be a total loss due to age of vehicle and all of our son and I's Volvo Road living miliage.  I do not look forward to the worst case scenario of this vehicle accident.  Black Book value for the volvo is around $3-$5 thousand.  We all know I will be loosing, becuase find a used car with all that I had within the Volvo for $3-$5 thousand.

volvo,xc90,2010,Poppy, 12/14/2009,Great Value,4,"Looked at ML350, Q5, MDX, RX350 and X5.  This vehicle was head and shoulders above the ML350.  Each of the others had its strong points; but my wife chose the XC90 because she liked it best (it had the best overall visibility).  We've had it for almost 4 months now and have had absolutely no problems.  The fuel mileage is lousy; but competitive with most of the others--14 in town and 21 on the road. It does use regular while the others require premium.  The fact that the XC-90 is the least expensive of the bunch is  real bonus."
volvo,xc90,2010,cabotcourt, 02/23/2010,Good Value for the Money,4,"I was apathetic about buying the XC90...too many of them on the road, until I saw the styling of the R-design package...definitely sets itself apart from the pack. The 5 year maintenance/wear and tear program and safety record was what ultimately sold me. Overall, very happy with the vehicle. Just wish it had better gas mileage. A few other minor annoyances like the brake pedal being too close to the gas pedal and the seats seem a bit narrow, but once you get used to these ""quirks"" they take a back seat to the overall value I think the vehicle offers."
volvo,xc90,2010,4everyoung, 03/29/2010,After 2 months,4,Overall one of the better values in the luxury suv market (especially one with 7 seats) and in my opinion one of the better looking suvs' out there even if its an older design.

volvo,xc90,2011,Jack, 09/30/2010,2011 XC90 R-Design,4,Am I the first to review the 2011 model?  I have had one four days now and I absolutely love it.  I can not find anything to criticize  about the car.  You pay for what you get and I feel every option was worth the price.  The Volvo drives rock steady on the road and I feel the engine is adequate.  I had some concerns about the 6 cylinder but it does the job.  So far in mixed driving I am averaging 20MPG.  I think with highway driving that will increase.  Bluetooth is now built in and works superbly.  The radio/telephone controls are mixed together and are a little overwhelming at first but work as designed.  The seats are very comfortable and love the R-Design color scheme.  Love this car!
volvo,xc90,2011,D. A. Prescott, 10/04/2016,Traded-in 2013 XC60 for 2011 XC90,4,"I have become a forever-Volvo owner, and through time remain loyal due to the security, driving experience, and knowledge of safely protecting those I love. Recently, after purchasing a 2013 XC60 in 2014, after owning this car for 1 year (and enjoying the advanced electronic features), I happily 'traded-down' for a 2011 XC90 ! Comparatively the XC60's driving experience confirmed the car was driving me, momentum not balanced and did not hug the road in the manner to which I've become accustomed. My 2011 XC90 (2nd in the family, and my 6th Volvo) had much better visibility, truly hugged the road with confidence of an automatic all-wheel drive the way it should - with fierce grip yet a smooth driving experience. I do not believe the XC60 has 'matured' enough in engineering the actual driving experience (rather they concentrated on features) that the XC90 has claimed. It is not a speed-demon by any means, however it accelerates at higher speeds beautifully (turbo), and my driving confidence in any weather or road condition (having driven through Adirondack blizzards with other all-wheel cars crawling or stopping) knowing I and my loved ones are safe and comfortable.

(Endeavor held up well) I have been very pleased with the comfort, the added accessories and the overall drive of the XC90.
When I initially read the reviews before purchasing it, I saw many complaints over the gas mileage.
I have not found any difference between the gas mileage of my Endeavor and the XC90.
I am happy with the gas mileage. The comfortable (heated) seats, the sophisticated look and other added features I didn't have in my Endeavor, make me very happy."
volvo,xc90,2011,akbrant, 11/01/2011,Magic Blue R-Design for the Road,4,"I traded my 2011 XC70 for this 2011 XC90 in March 2011 for a road trip from Alaska to Texas on to California and back to Alaska.
I put 13,000 miles on this baby in 30 days.
I have never had a vehicle cradle me on a long rip like this one.
I drove many 600-800 mile days and had not one ache or pain at the end of the day.
The OEM Perrelli tires sucked, and I put Continental AWD Contacts on and it is luxury personified.
The NAV is clunky, but I got used to it as the days went on.
I have to leave the NAV on or the backup camera would never get used as it takes too long to rise up.
It is sad I gave up newer technology in the XC70, but ergonomically the XC90 is much better for a tall guys."

volvo,xc90,2011,rocco, 11/08/2010,A Volvo that turns heads??,4,"I've just owned the XC90 R-Design for a bit over a week, so I can not speak to its durability or reliability, but I can say that this is one of the best looking, most comfortable, spacious, versatile and well designed SUV's/crossovers on the market. I looked at EVERYTHING in the segment before deciding on the Volvo for offering what is, in my opinion, the most attractive package at a price that can't be touched by BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura.  I am a loyal BMW owner and have been extremely pleasantly surprised by Volvo's offering. While the XC90 is an aging design, the R-Design breathes new life into it."
volvo,xc90,2011,Brian Loek, 03/03/2018,Safety YES but poor execution,3,"My wife and I bought our Volvo XC90 while we were living in the UK but since we were returning to the U.S. within a year we had the vehicle built under U.S. specs. As far as the design of the vehicle when it comes to safety it is 100% safe during the first 36K miles. After that you are rolling the dice. My wife and I have had to have the driver side seatbelt replaced twice which tells me Volvo went cheap on things you can't see. I have never had to have a seatbelt replaced. I have had cars with 190K miles on them that had the original factory seatbelts in them that hadn't been replaced. Next, the AC system went out on my wife with no warning with less than 36K miles on it. Luckily, our vehicle has always been under warranty. Manual lumbar support; are you kidding me???? Even my 97 Ford Explorer had electric lumbar support. Do not buy this vehicle used. New with a warranty is your safest bet. Also, if you plan on keeping this vehicle long term make sure you maintain the warranty and have a maintenance package. You will regret it if you don't. The level of tech in this vehicle for a 2011 make car is weak. Volvo tried to make a huge jump with their new XC-90, which I have driven, and that was a tech blunder as far as the infotainment system goes. Overall, I think Volvo is trying to save money by making subtle changes/upgrades to current model vehicles but they are trying to make big leaps when they re-design their vehicles which introduces too many changes in one package which in my opinion creates too many potential problems. Also, support for Volvo along the Gulf Coast is very weak. There are only two dealerships in my area and they are both 30 or more minutes away. Do not buy this vehicle if your nearest dealership is more than an hour away. You will burn up a lot of gas to have it serviced. Don't use third party repair shops or parts. You're just going to be throwing away your money. 5 September 2020 follow-up:  At this point my wife and I have had this car for 9 years with 66000 miles on it and for a 9 year old car I would still give it a three star rating: Additional things that have gone wrong since my last review.  The passenger side BLIS sensor constantly gives false indications or the whole system locks up when the vehicle is first started up. The moonroof cover is no longer connected to the track it was in and btw, my wife and I have rarely used the moonroof.  The headliner up by the windshield has started to delaminate. This is a 2011 vehicle and my 1997 Eddie Bauer's, headliner stayed intact the whole time we had it and we bought that in 2003.  The only reason why I got rid of the Ford was because it had 200K miles and major parts were starting to fail.  Also, the AC system has never been the same since the time it went out.  The receiver for the driver's side seatbelt has also started having issues with locking in the belt.  In short, do not by this body style Volvo, no matter what price the dealer is offering it to you at.  You'll dump more money into keeping it running and in decent conditon than the monthly payment unless you buy it outright. I think they stopped making this version of the XC-90 around 2015. On another note, do not buy a new Volvo XC-90 until they put manual AC controls on the dash again because everything is under the iPad menus right now.  I know it sounds stupid but if you live somewhere outside of Europe where you have blistering hot summers you need back-up controls for your AC just in case the iPad display dies and yes iPads do fail and they are even more likely to fail if you can't park your car in a garage when you aren't using it.  This vehicle is a has been.  Not worth the money as used or certified pre-owned. In short, stay away from these XC-90s.

Leather seats are beige and middle section of leather seats look extremely worn and veined, wearing business attire. Leather in the middle section of the seats looks smoother compared to surrounding areas of seats and scares easily. This flaw will impact resale

volvo,xc90,2012,Tom, 11/18/2017,2012 XC90 stable car but high maintenance cost,3,"Bought the 2012 XC90 with 50 000 miles 12/ 2014 for $23000, The car has been ok but has some major maintenance issues, over the last 3 years I have used $12 000 for maintenance. Issues 1) One morning the car did not start - had it towed to dealerships for repair, it took them 7 hours of investigation @ $200+ hour to figure what is wrong - ended up paying $3000 for the repair - was not covered by warranty, the car had the AC fan sensor failing which kept the fan running and draining the battery - this took them 7 hours to figure out ! 2) AC broke @ $2000 cost, AC seems to very typical to break in XC90, had the same problem with an earlier XC90 3) all car engine mounts broke - replacement cost $1500 4) Brake pad and disk replacement $1600+. Maintenance cost is very high for Volvos - every single time it is brought to regular maintenance the cost is at least $1000, mostly $1500. My XC90 has still few irritating faults like the remote key does work only randomly, and the steering wheel radio control has an irritating bug, if you press volume control and then immediately channel selection - the radio jumps into programming mode. I would not buy pre owned Volvo again, the reliablity is not there and cost to maintain is very high.

volvo,xc90,2012,Rene, 05/18/2016,High Expectations Slashed,3,"I purchased this vehicle off the lot because of it's superior safety rating.  I have two young kids, wanted them to learn to drive in city traffic in this so they are safe.  Four year in and to date, this vehicle has performed it's job protecting my children.  Even when I purchased this vehicle back years ago, the dashboard and functionality was outdated, but my focus was safety.  I told the salesman that my only two criteria for an XC90 was that the car is white and that it has to have a navigation system.  

Today, I am burdened with a vehicle that works well mechanically, but the navigation system does not work consistently.  Yes, I have an iPhone.  No, I do not want to use it for navigation.   In February, 2015, I contacted the dealer who sold me the vehicle and told them of my navigation/backup camera issue (the backup camera comes on, then the screen goes black and the window stays up, and the navigation system is completely disabled).  I took the vehicle into the dealer for software updates SIX times in one year.  The fix has never been installed because it does not exist.  Volvo has given up on fixing the software, they have thrown up their hands and advised me they are never going to fix it.

They have offered to ""allow"" me to trade in this vehicle for a new one; they were generous and offered me incentives being offered to everyone right now.  The dealer will not give more, they will lose money.  It's the Volvo manufacturing company that has turned their head and is not supporting their product.

They can fix it, they have to hire a software engineer to find the bug and fix it.  They have chosen not to.  Therefore, they are refusing to repair a vehicle they manufactured.   Clearly printed in their documentation, ""From Design, Engineering, and Manufacturing to support activities in Parts, Service, and Sales, high standards have been set to help insure your satisfaction and pride as an owner of a Volvo.”     I am neither satisfied nor proud.  

I could have purchased any SUV for my family with a third row seat.  I chose this one, my very first Volvo, because of the company reputation and the research that I did indicating they were a solid company that stood behind their products.  Boy, was I fooled.  

Could of bought a Mercedes.  Could of bought an Audi.  Could have bought a Lexus.    I have owned a vehicle from each of those manufacturers in the past and never run into a problem with maintenance or repair.   Now I will suffer the price when I trade in this vehicle and take a lesser amount for the manufacturer's defect.   So, I guess I'm paying for the navigation system twice!   

Is the vehicle a complete loss?  No, the vehicle itself has worked fine mechanically.  It is truly unfortunate that the only upgrade option that I requested is the one thing that failed.  What strikes me the hardest is the lack of support from the manufacturer.  I will never buy another Volvo again.

Issues I have had with my XC90:
* Brakes- Squeal, rub, vibrate...dealer would not fix.
* Starter went out...leaving me stranded in the middle of the highway
* AC compressor went out
* Loud rattles and clicking noises while driving
* Leather seats get scratches on them easily from clothing rubbing against them
* Back up warning alarm did not alarm at times
* Blind spot indicator sensors would not work properly at times.
* Third row seat is a waste, no adult will fit in it.

volvo,xc90,2016,Swedishsmitten, 06/22/2016,New Standard for SUV's,4,"Very simply this is a great automobile.  We had been a Jeep Grand Cherokee family for 20 years but needed a 3rd row.  Base suspension is great.  Very smooth and firm, which means it does not feel like a boat.  Check your tire pressure when you first get the car.  Ours had 45 psi which we found out it quite common as they overfill in Sweden so the tires do not flat spot in shipping.  They should check it before delivery but ours was missed.  I think some of the rough ride comments are caused by this.  After correcting this the ride is amazing.  Seats are the best I have ever sat in with great lumbar adjustment.  The power is fine.  316 horsepower from a 4 cylinder engine is amazing.

Overheating and no AC - engine management system advises to immediately shutdown the engine. Towed into a local dealership. Has taken 8 days to have vehicle repaired and still do not have the car back home. Very poor customer service from Volvo, the Corporation. Have received good but not outstanding service from the dealerships in trying to resolve the issues. I assume Volvo brand and value proposition is based upon the fact that a $64,000 car is actually ""a cheap car"" and therefore the customer should not really expect superior customer service!

volvo,xc90,2016,Matt H., 10/09/2017,Long Term Review,5,"We bought our 2016 XC90 T6 Inscription in December of 2015 with only 3 miles on it straight from the factory. It had every available package, except air suspension. We also had the 21"" upgraded wheels, and later added the towing package when the parts became available a couple weeks later. 

We also have Apple CarPlay that was provided by the dealer at no additional cost. Just recently we paid to have the Auto Pilot upgraded to Auto Pilot Assist 2 for 2017. 

So far we've loved it. We also renewed our Volvo on Call service through the rest of the life our vehicle loan because we like the remote start feature since we live in Colorado where we get snow during the winter. 

We've had the vehicle almost two full years now with minimal issues. I've noticed several reviews that gave bad ratings due to software issues. We've never had any issues with software but only once when the OS would randomly reboot itself. That ended up getting fixed with a software update at the dealership. We haven't had any trouble since.

Mechanically we've only had 3 issues, the rear brakes were heavily squealing. They gave us the upgraded rotors due to that being a known issue on early 2016 models which was covered under warranty. 

Our second mechanical issue came when the blinkers would fail to work and it popped an error. We brought it into service, and they replaced the entire assembly, new controls, wiring, and software which fixed the issue. They had the car for two days but they've always given us a loaner vehicle, even when brought in for a regular interval service. Everything was covered under warranty. 

We also had a fuel sensor go out, which was also under warranty. We've gotten a few recalls since we've had the vehicle, but none were ever issues that would jeopardize safety and all were fixed promptly at the dealership, about 95% of them were all software recalls. That has been the extent of any trouble we've seen, which to us has been pretty minimal. 

Volvo's service department near us has been absolutely wonderful, and some of the best service we've gotten from any industry. They go out of their way to make us 100% happy when we step out that door and we've been extremely happy with customer service. 

Now for nitpicks we didn't like after owning it for this amount of time. There needs to be more USB ports. The 2016 model only has one in the entire vehicle. In all honesty, it needs at least 4. 2 in the front and 2 in the back for passengers. We noticed a significant difference between the lower end models and our model with road comfort, and that's due to the upgraded 21"" rims. With less tire on the road, there's less cushion for a smoother ride, so while you feel more bumps, it's still extremely quiet. It has some of the best seats in the industry and has been great for long car rides. In the future however, we'll be not doing the upgraded wheels since we learned that makes a large difference in ride comfort. That doesn't affect our review negatively since that was a choice that we made when purchasing, but just something to keep in mind for future buyers. 

Gas mileage has been less than advertised, but it's worth it to note that both me and my wife are heavy on the foot at stops. We do keep the start/stop feature on, but forget to turn on eco mode on the highway which makes a difference. We also mostly do city driving which also makes a difference in gas mileage overall. When we're on road trips or actively trying to conserve gas we get an average of about 25, which is closer to the actual estimated. I feel that letting you know how we drive the vehicle makes a difference in why our combined MPG is the number it is and not something higher, which it could definitely get. Other than that, we've been extremely happy with our XC90 and can't wait to get our next Volvo in the future.

10/09/19 Update
We've still had no mechanical issues to
 speak of. Software bugs are rare now that they've worked out all the kinks, but we have noticed the bootup sequence of the touch screen has gotten painfully slow with time. This has been our biggest frustration.

Since I've written this article, Volvo offers a new service to add an additional USB port into the center arm rest just like the new models. So we added that to our vehicle. They've also just recently added the option to upgrade to the 2020 model year safety tech for XC90's in the 2016 and 2017 model year, so we plan on doing that as well.

Mechanically we've had no more issues since my last review. We're currently sitting at just over 60,000 miles.

Our warranty expired and we haven't renewed. Getting serviced without the warranty is really expensive. It costs between $2 and $250 every 10K interval, it's worth it to get the extended warranty if you're buying new. Don't buy into the warranty that the third party offers. Just buy into Volvo's certified or pre certified if you're buying used, it's much better.

After owning it for nine days I received a suspension error code followed by a safety restraint error code and  promptly sent it in for service. It was in the Volvo dealership in Tulsa for over 30 days. After I received my car back I had it for less than one week before more electronic error codes again began popping up in addition to my virtual speedometer going black on rainy night. Despite dispatching numerous Volvo engineers who attempted to service my car, Volvo was unable to repair it and didn't give me a refund after four months of ownership. I would tread extremely carefully with this first model year car as it seems Volvo has no idea how to have the various modules interact with each other. I would visit various Volvo forums to better understand the gravity of this problem and Volvo's pompous attitude to their new customers of the 2016 ""car of the year""

volvo,xc90,2016,Mike Aiello, 04/07/2016,2016 XC90 T8 In Shop FOR 14 Days Today Owned for,1,"***Update - the vehicle was bought back by Volvo.  The electrical and electronic problems could not be resolved.  Too bad, as is would have been an excellent vehicle otherwise.  ***

We have experienced what appears to be a complete failure of the control systems of the 2016 XC90 T8.  It started out with an SRS error and has become a complete reloading of all software, replacement of poor door lock module, AC water leak under the carpet and not a faulty 'connector'.  Been at the dealer service center for the past 14 days and is expected to be there for at least another week or so.  

DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE - Ask them about the software issues before you buy.  You will find out the since the XC90 T8 for 2016 is a brand new vehicle, they are experiencing  issues that they have to learn how to diagnose.  If you want to be a guinea pig like us, buy.  If not, wait of find something else.

This is our first and last experience with Volvo ownership. Period.

Update - This vehicle was bought back by Volvo for full price in order to avoid the Lemon Law actions.  Very satisfied that Volvo lived up to their problems and took the faulty vehicle off of our hands.  Still no chance of us owning another Volvo.

volvo,xc90,2016,Sageman, 05/28/2016,Amazing Vehicle,5,"This is a phenomenal vehicle.  I have 3000 miles on my T8 Inscription and could not be happier.  I drove BMW, new Audi Q7, new MB and Porche; the T8 is the true winner.  If you are considering a T6 or T8, the first option I would recommend is the air suspension.  It is a gamer changer offering a smoother, quieter ride and improved handling.  Going for the Inscription package raises the interior seating and finishes to an extremely high level.  Then of course Intellisafe safety features are wonderful.  And finally, if you are into music, the BW sound system is uncompromising.  Wow.

The T8 plug in hybrid's battery cost 50 cents to charge and it provides enough electric only miles for most of my city driving needs.  We charge between 1 and 5am using a timer to get the lowest electrical rate of 4 cents per kw (here in Arizona).  In the electric mode, the car it incredibly quiet.  Really magical.

volvo,xc90,2016,SweetOldBill, 08/26/2016,Hold off buying this car !,3,"Love my new Volvo XC90 when it starts. Beautiful inside and out, lots of great safety features, and a pleasure to drive. However, there have been severe software issues and most recently battery draining for no apparent reason when it sits.  Each trip to shop has been 2 - 3 days, because their technicians are not fully up to speed and/or the software is too screwed up. They generally have to do a remote consult with Volvo engineers..  As I write this I am about to jump start it to take it back to the shop again, just a month after the last battery episode (they did a battery reset and then installed a new battery last time, but never did find the cause).  Do a Google search and you will find dozens of other people with the same problem.  Another issue is quirky navigation system.  Usually reliable, but occasionally totally screws up destination city.  My recommendation.  Do not buy this car yet.  Perhaps wait a year until Volvo gets their act together.

volvo,xc90,2016,Hugo F, 05/20/2016,"Great, after trouble with start was finally fixed",4,"Bit spoilt also having a tesla (hence the infotainment system seems slow and buggy compared to the tesla, even though it's miles ahead of typical cars) but the interior is really nice as is the lane follow and adaptive cruise. Very relaxing on long journeys.

Update May 2017: we got the software update to ""pilot assist 2"" and this is a huge improvement over the v1 system. Long journeys are now even more bearable!

Had problems with the electric parking brake locking on, stranding my wife in the school parking lot. Volvo said the car needed to be towed to the dealer; I found a discussion thread and someone mentioned pulling the parking brake fuse to reset the system (open hood, look inside fusebox cover to identify the fuse, pull, leave a minute, replace, done) - this fixed the issue totally for us. Going to get the dealer to check for a firmware update for that component at the next service.

Update May 2017: Have had several firmware updates, and tried switching the head unit SIM from the supplied AT&T to T-Mobile (easy job) but still we can't get pandora streaming reliably within 5 minutes of starting to drive. The touchscreen is infuriatingly slow and buggy, and the connectivity (not sure if it's 3G or LTE) is ridiculously slow even when showing full signal.

Update May 2018: The touchscreen is still awful compared to a Tesla. Apps are essentially useless, and the 3G connection is still awful.

The hybrid system failed last week too, thought the car remains fully drivable on gas. Waiting for a service slot for this to be diagnosed.

Update November 2017: Have had 3+ occasions where the car won't start (well, turn on). Foot on brake, turn the on/off control and ... nothing. We worked out that getting out of the car, locking it, waiting a couple of minutes and trying again usually gets it to start but wtf, this is just ridiculous. The dealer managed to replicate it, but not fix the problem....

Update May 2018: Eventually, after many more service trips, the ""car won't start"" issue was found and addressed earlier this year. The car powers up both on hydraulic pressure (from pushing pedal) and also from a switch on the brake pedal... it turns out that, as the dealership traced the wires through, that the switch input to the ECU was not clicked into place. After this was fixed, we have not seen the issue again. Finally!

Update May 2020: No issues since may 2018. Still very happy with comfort & performance. The touchscreen is still awful though... hopefully the next generation XC90 will address that.

Update November 2020: Key fob batteries are mysteriously running out. Have to change them once a month, pretty much. Car still good though.

volvo,xc90,2016,Dale, 11/19/2015,Who needs options,5,"The base Momentum is a steal compared to the competition. The only option I ordered was a trailer hitch.
The ride is smooth and quiet. The sound system is great. The seats are the most comfortable I have every experienced.
So many optional items on other vehicles are standard such as heated, leather, power seats, huge moonroof, navigation and lots of safety features.
We are getting 27 to 28 MPG on the highway at 70 to 75 miles per hour in calm winds.
I am not a fan of the auto start/stop function and I prefer the Dynamic driving mode which is very peppy in city driving and disables the start/stop function.
I wish the car remembered the previous driving mode setting so you don't have to select it each time you start the car.
I also would like to see a Home Link option for opening the garage door.

volvo,xc90,2016,Dr. EA, 12/27/2016,I hate myself for trading my Mercedes GL450,1,"I thought I'm buying a better car! I traded my confi and very reliable GL450 2010 for this piece of junk! It's definitely not worth $60K. The electronics are terrible, the panel control needs to be reprogrammed to make it user friendly, 9 month later I still struggle to maneuver it and I'm techy savvy! The A/C is not reliable goes from silent to wind tunnel and we can barely hear each other in the car. This past summer the entire car blacked out during a trip on the highway, it was 108F outside and the near exit was 8 miles away...we melted, let alone the entire car was out power (no lights, radio, A/C etc.), only the engine was running! This happened 3 times so far! The panel also has tons of buggs and crashes very frequently. The brakes squeak! I took it to the dealer who are very helpful but was told the rotors are not available and are on back-order! several recalls so far can't count them!! I have a parking aid, the sensor doesn't work 9 out of 10!! I paid for it but don't use it!! The app has a starter that 9out 10 doesnt work and never starts the car!! totally unreliable!! Last thing, the trunk controls buttons (front and back) are extremely slow responders (it takes sometimes 3-5 seconds before they respond, which led to an accident, backed the car while the trunk was open thinking it was closed!!

When I came out of the store my car wouldn't start due to a warning light that indicated the parking brake needed service.  I called the Volvo dealer and they had me try putting my key in the slot on the console to see if that would work, nothing happened.  I was told that the car would indeed have to be towed into the dealership.  Also, since my phone was connected to the Volvo it wiped out my contacts due to a computer glitch in the car!  Since the car was in park the tow truck driver had to call the dealership to see how to override the transmission so he could get the car to move.  I watched as they dragged my car up the tow truck ramp.  I traded in my 2010 XC90 with over 100,000 miles on it and the only time it was ever in the shop was for service.  I would wait to purchase the 2016 until all the bugs have been worked out and people know how to work on them.  This is so disappointing and frustrating.

That was exactly what the dealer told me.  The Turbo on the 4 cylinder is a joke and it sounds like a jet engine from inside the car and nothing can be done about it.  The tablet that controls EVERYTHING, is the devil!  Never works, freezes up, goes off for no reason and on and on and on.

Problem not solved, I still get a low battery warning. Can't wait to get out of this car!

volvo,xc90,2016,Michael Horton, 02/26/2016,"XC90 FIRST EDITION, GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR VOLVO",5,"As for all the hype and awards for this vehicle, all I can say is if you want a 7 passenger SUV go drive an Inscription trim with the air suspension (this is an important option).  To make it comparable to a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes, you need to step up to the Inscription trim and I would highly recommend it with the optional air suspension.  Without the air suspension the ride quality is average; with it, the ride is outstanding.  I had no intention of buying a Volvo, but was very surprised.  I drove all the competition extensively and bought an XC90 First Edition so it has every feature available.  The interior is amazing, the safety tech is unparalleled, and infotainment is great.  As for criticisms, the navigation system is not the best on the market, the car only has one USB port, and local mpg have been poorer than advertised.  However, on a recent trip from Phoenix to LA, we averaged almost 28 mpg.  I quickly got used to the touch tablet style interface and enjoy the ease of use.  I personally love the seats (heated/ventilated), Apple Car Play, heads up display, and the Bowers and Wilkens stereo will blow you away.  Again, safety features are amazing.  As for the competition, the X5 from the driver’s seat is a great vehicle, but it is smaller inside and the Volvo kills it in 2nd and 3rd row functionality and utility, which is what we needed.  The Lexus GX (keep in mind I really like Lexus and owned an RX for over a decade) feels heavy and sluggish compared to the Volvo.  The new Audi Q7 was not available when I bought and the older version was surprisingly tight inside.  The Merc GL is a bigger vehicle but when I optioned it out to match my Volvo First Edition from a feature standpoint it was over $90k.  The Volvo truly feels like a smaller vehicle than it is while driving and eats up highway miles.  My wife and I fight over who takes it each day.  I hope the long term reliability is above average.  This new XC90 is a giant step forward for Volvo!

Thankfully, the car is under warranty but the hassle and the lack of confidence that this vehicle will keep our family safe is zero.  --We've had starting issues, navigation issues, issues with the transmission slipping and the latest incident where only the driver side door would unlock, meaning no one could get in or out of the vehicle unless we crawled through the driver side window. THAT IS NOT SAFE and since the dealership cannot guarantee it won't happen again, we are continuing to drive a loaner vehicle until they can figure out the issue.   It is a gorgeous car and when it runs, it is so much fun to drive BUT I'm now wishing I would have purchased the Audi or Land Rover.  Save yourself the hassle and wait until they get the kinks out of this car.  UPDATE:  The car ended up being in the shop a total of 8 times within months of our purchase. With all the issues with this vehicle and discussions with lawyers, we finally went through a process with Volvo and the dealership to return this lemon of a car and get a new one (a long story that was a nightmare in and of itself) but we now drive a 2017 version and it is running fine (knock on wood).

Overall the car has 21"" wheels which make the ride a bit rough, but the seats and interior make up for it.  XC90 is a family hauler and not the fastest off the line, but it makes up for it in technology, comfort and value.  For $62k you get act that in MBZ would cost you $80k, plus it's totally unique looking (I get compliments) :-)

There is another software update due in 10/16 that is rumored to fix a bit more of the AC controls and make the command system boot faster.

The second vehicle has been equally disastrous. Brake problems at 3,000 miles (rotors and pads, front and back), defective auto stop, battery charge issues, recalls, suspension squeaking -- need I say more? 128 Volvo has been very accommodating on both the sales and service end and I have now filed a complaint with Volvo of North America to end the lease. Such a shame, as the car is gorgeous and drives sweet when I have it.

volvo,xc90,2016,Adrian Eckenrod, 08/05/2015,A True Luxury SUV with Outstanding Technology,5,"While we have only had our 2016 XC90 for a week, we truly love this SUV. The vehicle is primarily driven by the wife and on family trips. We were not even looking for a Volvo at first. Previously we had a 2004 XC90 and while an OK vehicle we never loved it, size was good, handling and MPG were not. We downsized from that to a new 2012 XC60 which was also nice (much better handling and MPG). Although nowhere near the same luxury as our prior Mercedes. With two kids it quickly became too small. Was looking to upsize and considered the following 2015/16 vehicles: Acura MDX, Range Rover, Porsche Cayenne (too small), Audi Q7 and Mercedes GL. We have always been partial to Mercedes and loved all our prior MB's so it was looking like that would be our next choice. Took the XC60 to the Volvo dealer for an offer and that's when we saw the new XC90. This vehicle is nothing like the prior XC90, it is easy to see what Volvo has been doing with the $11 billon from Geely. I am not concerned with a Chinese company being the parent owner of Volvo, as the Swedes still design and build the car. Look around these days and you will find many of the high-end items in the world owned by someone else. 

The luxury from the new XC90 is completely on par with the Germans. The Europeans have mastered the art of that for years but always seem to lag in the technology arena. Even when they do offer technology it is not on level with what high-end Japanese autos offered; not to mention you will easily add $10k to the European vehicles with options and still envy what the Japanese models have. The XC90 is a vehicle exceeding at both. Ours is a fully loaded model (spec'd same as a First Edition) and in no category does it lack. The luxury from the 18-way adjustable (Inscription model) front seats to the perfect balance of Nappa leather, birch wood and metal accents leave no doubt every detail has been thought of. Should you even find a glove box that can also cool down to 40 degrees in a European car, rest assured it will be another pricey option. The place I could see an improvement would be additional USB ports, but plug in one of the adapters that gives you two USB ports per outlet and problem solved. Reading other reviews prior to our purchase that was also one of the few things people could seem to gripe about. If lack of multiple USB ports are the biggest complaints with the XC90, then I think Volvo has succeeded in their goal of making a new iconic flagship for their brand. The all glass instrument cluster and center stack is as functional as it is aesthetically pleasing. The tablet like interface is extremely easy to use and does respond instantly (was a big concern of mine). Want to test the responsiveness, adjust the temperature slide up and down, it responds as fast as you can move your finger! Looking forward to the upcoming update to include Apple Carplay and Android Auto integration. The heads up display is another feature worth getting, very nice never having to take your eyes of the road. The enormous panorama sunroof is something the backseat and even third row passengers will enjoy. Shutting the doors is a solid thud I haven't heard since our last Mercedes. Again every aspect of this vehicle we just love.

The drive is outstanding for this capable 7 passenger SUV, especially for a 2 liter 4 cylinder engine. It has better handling and performance than our prior XC60 with an engine twice the size. While it can't tow as much as the Q7 (the XC90 is rated to tow 5000 lbs) and is not as sporty as the Porsche or BMW, it is certainly a well balanced mix of comfort, performance and capability. The cargo space is seemingly endless (especially when compared to more sporty brands). It does offer four different driving modes which further enhances your driving experience. You certainly feel like you’re driving a luxury sedan, not a heavy truck or large
 SUV feeling about the drive. My primary car is a Porsche, and this is our first SUV I don't mind driving.

Safety is my paramount concern when purchasing a vehicle for the family. That is one reason I was originally looking hard at the Mercedes, but Volvo certainly knows how to build an extremely safe car as well. They further drove that point home with all the advanced safety features this vehicle packs. There is no need for me to go over all of them, you can read all about them for the next hour in other reviews. I will say they are impressive and non-intrusive. I absolutely love the lane keeping aid. A gentle steering nudge reminds you when you are veering out of your lane. I believe that is actually making us safer drivers all around because it brings to point when and how often you were drifting. Having that truly lets you know how attentive you are to the road and your primary task while behind the wheel.

If you are in the market for a luxury SUV, you would be remiss if you don't check out the new XC90. This one is nothing like any Volvo of years past for all the right reasons.

volvo,xc90,2016,Ramsay Battin, 04/27/2017,XC90 T8 plagued with problems,2,"We bought our $84k TX90T8 about a year ago and it's been nothing but problems. We've had it in the shop twice for a total of 30 days to fix problems with the hybrid system. Message from car was ""Hybrid System Failure, take to dealer immediately"". Both times we were out of town. In the first instance, we ran out of gas before we could get it to the dealer and the car wouldn't restart. Had to get it towed to the dealer. The second time we had enough gas to get it to the dealer fortunately. We also had issues with the ""Park Assist"" where it intermittently would shut off. Our dealer finally determined that one of the sensors was broken and they replaced it. Another time, my wife was driving it down the highway with the kids in the car when it suddenly lost all power. Thankfully she was able to get it to the curb safely. She called the dealer who's advice was to ""turn the car off and then turn it back on"". She did so and it worked - but the whole situation did not engender confidence in the car. Not been a great experience thus far and we're only a year into it!

volvo,xc90,2016,Jerry L., 12/04/2016,Finger Nail Across the Blackboard!,2,"before i bought this car, i did a lot of research, and test drove every car in its class. on paper this car has the most standard feature among all of the same vehicle in its class for the price hands down. but soon after i got the car, i start hearing break noises...... now i am driving a loaner car for the fourth time! every time so far has been with the same issue.... noisy breaks. perhaps this problem isn't as serious as those electronic failure or engine and transmission issues, but for a new car that i have driven for less than half a year(it has literally been at the dealer ship for about 28 days for repair total i kid you not! the previous time i sent it in for breaks and they fried the turn signal module while doing software update, i waited over 3 weeks for that one time since the parts come from abroad). if you ever drive on the freeway and hear loud squeaky breaks and try to look for that semi but then realize that it was you then you would know how it feels.  i have told Volvo and the dealership that this will the last time i am fixing this issue. if they still cannot fix it i would need to end the lease. Volvo and the dealership have been nice so far, the reason i didn't say helpful because my issue has not been fixed. my suggestion for those of you considering this car is wait until the 2018 model, heck i don't think they have fix the break issue for the 2017s. i also wish that those of you that have gotten the vehicle do not experience what i have  experienced, it is beyond annoying and frustrating.

They couldn't figure out problems.  VOLVO USA was argumentative and in denial.  Got a Q7.  Everything works.  Better performance.  FAR better electronics.  SUPER reliable.  I still miss the XC 90 magic blue color and the seats.  (My Q7 has regular, not luxery package seats).  Will NEVER buy another Volvo.  NEVER.

volvo,xc90,2016,NJVolvo, 06/11/2016,"Great car, terrible technology",2,"The good:  Car has great material, great feel, and great acceleration/braking.  A ton of space and smooth ride.  If the software was so terrible the car would be perfect.  

The bad/worst:  Car has so many software bugs and issues, it's just terrible.  Voice command will sometimes disable the radio buttons, the system crashes, auto stop/start works whenever it feels like it, and worst of all, the accident prevention braking goes off randomly.  Car decided to randomly apply brakes and almost caused our car to get rear-ended.

volvo,xc90,2016,Bob B, 12/18/2015,Overnight Test Drive & Still thinking,4,"I'll put it this way, the wife loved this car. we currently have a GL450 and it's aging and getting to be time to change. Our dealer was nice enough to give us a Inscription for an over night test drive. We found the performance better then what I have read in many reviews, though the comfort in the seats was ok. I'm sure there are plenty of settings that we could play with to adjust the seats. While driving, the wife found operating the radio and climate was a little cumbersome due to the ipad like technology. Again, something to get used to and we were new to the car. Ride quality and steering was very nice, but the funny thing is my wife picked up on the tiny steering wheel as compared to her GL. Over all though, the car seemed fantastic and it's still in consideration. Our only, and it's probably minor to so many out there, is the climate package on the Inscription. This gives you the heated windshield which would take some getting used to. For me it was like looking out a screen door with all the vertical wires running through the glass. Again, not a deal breaker, just something to get used to.

volvo,xc90,2016,Yu, 12/23/2016,Not a reliable VOLVO,1,"Updated review: the car wat sent to dealer many times because the start/stop function did not work. It has not been fixed. Every time the dealer charged up the battery and it worked for a day or two.  Volvo simply just looked at the check code and concluded there was nothing wrong. After many frustrations, I just gave up as I do not particularly like the start/stop feature. 

Bought the car because of Volvo's safety and reliability reputation. Nice looking car and drives great. But still I would say Do Not Buy. Owned XC90 for about 9 months. It went to shop for three times due to unknown battery draining issues commonly seen by many XC90 owners. So far the issue seems have been fixed but I heard many other owners still have the problem. Stop/start almost never worked. Dealer said nothing can be found regarding to this. Received three safety recalls on the car in 6 months. All small but annoying issues. Volvo made a bold redesign on XC90 but this one failed.

volvo,xc90,2016,Scott, 05/29/2017,Hybrid system plagued by poor quality - AVOID,3,"Our XC90 T8 is a little over a year old, and it has spent about two months of that time in the shop for several different visits.   The car has completely been drained of battery once and needed towing (it had no power at all, zero, not even the electric doors would work); it had a problem hesitating when going uphill that required over a month in the shop and parts shipped from Sweden; and many warning lights have been going off requiring trips to the dealer.   This new Volvo hybrid drive train is not ready for prime time.  Its too bad as its a very nice car otherwise.

Update 4 years later: after a long series of trips to the dealer they seem to have finally figured it out.. the time they replaced the whole system did it.  Car was in for a whole month but it got fixed.  We have had several years now with almost no mechanical issues at all.  If it was like this to begin with it would be a five star vehicle.. it is very comfortable, drives very smoothly, etc etc.

volvo,xc90,2016,Kris, 12/05/2015,Nothing like an Electrical Fire to Ruin your Day,1,"The dealer while very nice has no clue on how to fix these cars nor for that matter Volvo.  We had been having issues where the onboard screens would blank out when nav in use vehicle would do it twice and then reload while vehicle was in use.  This was an issue as your speedometer goes out and we were planning on taking it when it happened on a short trip but this time we smelled an odor then smoke came bellowing out of the center console.  We turned off the unit and contacted the nearest dealership.  The car has been there two weeks, contacted Volvo North America only to be told they could not find anything but they  thought it was due to software needing to be updated.  Updates were made and when dealer went to move car, battery was dead.  We were told they checked it out with meters and again felt it was a software issue.  Car was checked out and I was told the car was repaired.  I drove 100 miles to pick the car up only to get in and there was an error indicating the Battery Charge was low after being assured that despite my concerns that it had to be more than a software issue.  The car is still at the dealership as I was not willing to have them jump it and attempt to drive it home until they could get with Volvo North America.  I would hold off purchasing as no one seems to know how to fix it. Very disappointed

volvo,xc90,2016,MilesM, 01/03/2016,Volvo XC90 T8 Hybrid is a Beast!!!!!,5,"I own a brand new 2016 XC 90 T8 Hybrid.  As stated in many reviews, it is an awesome, awesome car!!!  It is a BEAST!!!!!  Beautiful exterior styling, and very smartly designed interior.  The T8 Hybrid is a perfect combination of Eco mode (electric) for short trips, and power mode (gas) for longer trips (very fuel efficient engine).  Power is stunning ( not quite Tesla, but at a better price point), for a 4 cylinder (who would have thought a 4 cylinder and electric motor could punch out almost 400 HP).  Add the safety components, and this is almost the perfect car for today's market.

Great job Volvo.  You have hit the SUV ""sweet spot"".  The perfect combination of form and function.  I am glad to say I am one of the first owners of this great vehicle.  May Volvo find much success and thrive in the future.  The XC90 (especially the hybrid T8) is a thoroughbred.

Still great after 7 months of use!!!!!

And hey don't be bashing the vehicles features just because your tiny mind cant handle the XC90 capability. 
It has easy to use features, if you know how to simply use an Ipad or Iphone, this touch screen is the same thing. I love how the vehicle ""grips "" the road! It has the feel of a car, the simplicity of an Ipad for features, amazing quality of materials from the leather seats to the wood grain on the dashboard.

volvo,xc90,2016,Ro Ta, 12/05/2016,2016 XC 90,1,"This car is very nice while it works. However there are way to many issues with it. Software issues are very common. I basically had to take it to the shop for two months straight. The most frustrating experience was just having the car flat out not start with plashing park (brake service warnings). This has happened like 4 times in 6 months. Not only did this happen on my current Volvo XC 90, I had the same exact 2016 prior to that, in which Volvo ended up buying back. Replaced that car, but the other day I was at the grocery store and boom Same message, car will not start and is currently needing to be towed back to the dealer. I would stay away from Volvo. While the car is super nice, when it works, it is just way to un reliable and has way to many issues. I mean, come on! It's a brand new car!"
volvo,xc90,2016,No longer a volvo fan, 12/30/2016,Don't waste your time,2,"We brought our xc90 back on June of 2015 after trading in our 2013 xc60. It was one of the first models, fresh off  the assembly line. It is a beautiful car. But don't let it's looks fool you. The first 6 months were great. Then things started to go downhill. The first thing that happened was the hood flew open while we were driving. Luckily we were on a city street and were only driving 30 miles per hour; this could have been a disaster. We had the car towed to the dealer. They identified a faulty hood release and fixed the body work free of charge. Next we started to notice that the safety system is too sensitive. We had 2 instances of the car stopping itself (braking) for no apparent reason while in city traffic. Again, disaster was averted due to low speed and traffic. The car also has electronic and braking issues. Out of the blue the brakes started squealing and grinding to the point that it was undrivable  (at 11k miles). Had it towed to the dealer where the front and rear brakes and rotors had to be replaced. While there, I asked that the software be updated (the dealer couldn't manage to figure it out when I was last there). They had problems with it. My car was out of service for 2 weeks due to an inability to update the software that controls many features of the car. A week after I picked it up I took it back because the brake light would not go off and all of the tire sensors were on. It's been there for the last 2 weeks and they can't figure out how to fix the issues.  Shame on volvo for using its customers as guinea pigs; the car has many issues that they are working out in the field and it's not okay! Save your money, time, and energy and buy something else! I've moved on to a lovely audi!

volvo,xc90,2016,CGleas, 03/04/2017,Great ride but electronic nightmare,2,"I love the ride and the drive of this vehicle.  However, it has had one electronic glitch after another-each computer reboot leads to a new issue that can't seemed to be resolved at the dealer (Volvo of Louisville).  The touch pad has gone completely blank, the temperature gauge can have wild swings, the apps don't work well- the latest is that when I start the car or first back it up in the morning, the radio changes from sirius XM to a Christian FM channel.  I have the beige Napa leather seats but the drivers seat has worn thru the finish and I await a new seat cover for a car that is 11 months old.  Unless you have much time to spend  at the dealer, I would not recommend this vehicle.  I tried to trade it in, at the dealer where it was purchased,  and was told I would have to pay $52000 in addition to turning in this vehicle to get an similar XC90 ($32000 is owed).  Shocking, right? but Kelly the manager said this was her best offer.  Do the math, my car is worth about $23000 according to this manager.  I would consider this extremely poor resale or an extremely poor manager.  Anyhow I'm stuck with an untrustworthy and overpriced vehicle for now.
UPDATE (March 2018):  Most glitches have been worked out except now my phone won’t pair with the car.  I opted not to pay for Volvo on Call ($10/month) so most apps don’t work.  Drivers seat cover was replaced but still stains badly and never looks good. It was deemed that the passenger seat was not worn enough to warrant replacement but it just doesn’t look good for a luxury car.  Would not buy this car again despite it’s great ride.
UPDATE: Sept 2018: The electronic glitches seemed to have been corrected.  Same issues with the seats- they stain very easily. I did take out the seat warranty but doubt it will cover.  The dent warranty didn’t cover a fist sized dent when I accidentally backed into an ornamental tree. Yes, the back up sensor was beeping but I was trying to avoid the basketball goal and didn’t see the tree! It’s still a great ride and I do enjoy driving the vehicle along with the satellite radio.

volvo,xc90,2016,DCHammer, 10/28/2017,Worst New Car Experience Ever,1,"The 2016 T8 Volvo XC90 was the car I wanted to love. Looked forward to owning it as soon as I heard it was in the works in 2014. Got what appeared to be a good deal on the lease. Unfortunately for this $70K car, I've had more days in the shop for repeated repairs than all the other automobiles I've owned in 4 decades put together. Software problems, sunroof water leak problems, transmission problems, navigation problems, acceleration problems. Now it needs to go back in the shop again and the local Volvo dealer has closed. The nearest Volvo dealer that will take care of warranty service is 5 hours away. Volvo is not interested in taking back their lease. I will be investigating our state's lemon law.  If you're looking for a good PHEV, I suggest the Ford CMax Energy. Half the price, twice the car except for smaller size and no AWD option.

volvo,xc90,2016,Dave H, 01/24/2018,Great SUV (When It WORKS),2,"When my wife and I leased this SUV, we fell in LOVE with it.  The screen, controls, the safety features and even the gas mileage was great.  We had it for 5 months and then the entire computer system went NUTS.  Left me stranded in a parking lot without being able to start the car because the computer applied the parking brake and would not let go.  Then the car only started the first try 70% of the time.  It took some button pushing and resetting with the door locks the other 30% (NO IDEA WHY) Then the noises started.  The dealer ended up replacing the entire front end and still noises persisted.  It ended up being faulty transmission and engine mounts.  To reiterate what another reviewer said, the dealer had to learn from Volvo Cars of America technicians how to work on the car.  Our XC90 was in the shop for more than 2 months that we had it.  We are now giving the car back to Volvo but if we were to keep it, it needs a software upgrade and the windows screech all the way down and up.  I love the styling and honestly love the SUV, but it seems they need to work through many items to make this Car of the Year worthy.

volvo,xc90,2016,Y Morgan, 12/01/2015,This SUV is the next step in the future of driving,4,"At least get the Convenience and Momentum Plus packages with this Luxury vehicle.The vehicle is built on proven technology. I realized that a lot of the gadgets and feature were already in some of the other Volvos, but the XC90 just take them to higher level. The XC90 drives sweet, I just have to get use to the engine turning off at every dead stop, and restarting when the brakes are released.
The inside is somewhat captivating, and there is more than enough room for everyone. Power outlets placed in strategic areas around the vehicle, and air vents are right in your face.
Update - 
After six months of driving the vehicle, some of the issues I have had has been software related. We had to visit the dealership at least five times during that period to get software issues fixed, some of these issues were serious, while others were not so serious.
Also the pickup/acceleration is slow in every drive mode except ""dynamic"", then it kicks assets.

volvo,xc90,2016,Tom T., 08/02/2016,Fabulous first month with XC90 T8,5,"My initial experience with the car is overwhelmingly positive.  So far I have put about 1000miles on the SUV, about 75% mileage comes from local driving - commuting to/from work, driving kids to school and other places etc.  I have yet to take a long trip or push the car to its limits.  Therefore it can’t qualify as a complete ownership review.  But for whatever it worths, I share my $0.02 with current and will-be fellow Volvo owners.

Maybe we start with some low lights

Sensus Touch Screen
Technologies are awesome, but also can be difficult to master. This is true in 2016 XC90.  Its central touch screen has 3 views to slide from left and right, plus a “car setting” view that is pulled from the top.  The screen navigation is complicated.  After two weeks, I still have trouble remembering how to get to certain settings. I tend to consider myself a techie and quite adept at picking up new things, Volvo central control proved that I am not as smart as I thought I was.

Key fab
It’s a classy design with leather wrapped around bulk of surface area.  It carries touch of a fine watch.   Function buttons are located on the either side, and that is where the trouble comes.  The buttons are small, difficult press and even more difficult to feel which is “lock” or “unlock”.  You will have to see it.  My key fab leather is blonde, matching the car’s interior.  However, Being in the pocket and rubbing against other stuff all the time isn’t the formula to keep key fab clean.  The key fab frame is aluminum.  My key has received a couple of small dents on the frame so far.  Volvo, if you are reading the post, please make the frame stainless steel.  The aluminum frame doesn’t match the leather wrap nor the $80K car price tag.

Park assist, Camera - bird’s eye view
My T8 comes with vision package, a great value and a must-have in my opinion. I especially love the synthesized bird eye view of the car.  I found it much more useful than park assist.  I, for one when equipped  with the overview camera, don’t have trouble maneuvering the car regardless parallel parking or back up parking.  Park assist, on the other hand, reacts slowly.  While I can see its usefulness for many, I only tested it for a couple of time before reverting to much faster manual parking.  BTW, park assist did work quite well when I used it. The bird’s eye view image becomes wonky when other tall objects are nearby.  This perhaps is the only knock on the vision package. I think it can be corrected via software algorithm.  I hope Volvo has a future software update for this.

Voice recognition 
Works about 80-85% of time.  The number might seem high, but in day-to-day usage, it is not very dependable.  Volvo obviously has some catch-up to do with Google etc in the voice recognition domain.

One USB port and no SD card slot

Dealer told me XC90 accepts micro SD card, but I am unable to insert the micro SD card to the slot next to the glove box release button.  No place in the manual refers to micro SD card either.  This interlude attests how much a dealer knows about this new vehicle.  And one USB port in this connected era spells major inconvenience for the owners.  I have to keep swapping between my phone, USB stick and passenger’s phones.

Having said all of that, there is a lot to like, or may I say the word love, about XC90 T8.  First and foremost,

Quite and Smooooooth
The twin engine combo has far exceeded my expectation.  The transition between the electric and gas engine is so seamless that I often fail to notice the switch taking place.   Thanks to the hybrid powertrain, the car starts with electric engine with zero noise and gas engine kicks in when more power is needed or cruising at high speed.  The result? no 4 cylinder whining at low gear.   the start/stop also works fabulously well in T8.  In many way, the car waltzes around with V8 like grace, smoothness and
 tranquility.  

Not only twin engines augment each other well, regenerative braking and mechanical braking work in perfect harmony.  I don’t believe any non-racing driver would be able to tell which braking is at work unless he peeks at the dashboard.

Power
I’ve not floored the gas pedal and rev the engine to the red line.  The car is still breaking in, I have to be easy on the throttle.  So I can’t verify the 5.3 sec from 0-60 mph, yet….  Even with that, XC90 T8 has plenty of juice at the low end, cruising around effortlessly with 5 people on board.  With a gentle push on on gas pedal, freeway overtaking comes with ease.  400 horse power brings about the reassuring feeling. While I won’t use it every time when taking the freeway on-ramp, I know all the ponies are there there to haul the heavy SUV when I need to.

Touch Sensus
Except Telsa which I haven’t used,  Volvo’s touch screen beats Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lexus etc. in my opinion.  The screen is clear under the direct sunlight and responsive to inputs.  It may be prone to finger prints, but courtesy protective screen cover and mic

volvo,xc90,2016,Hpc112, 04/08/2016,Amazing SUV for its price,5,"Coming from a BMW X3 this car has so many more safety and luxury features at the same price SUV.  Not to mention it's much larger and much peppier engine.  My wife and myself also looked at the BMW X5 and mb gle and Audi Q7.  We found x5 to be very expensive and the BMW dealer by us has a horrible service department, but the SUV drove nicely and interior was nice but very similar to the Volvo but 8,700 more for comperable equipment.  The gle was a bit small and no third row, transmission was a bit rough when passing.  The q7 was very out dated, no technology features, no safety features, worst fuel economy, we have no idea how it was rated so highly, it felt like it was a decade behind the others.  We also looked at the Range Rover sport, this was a very nice SUV but over budget about 24,000 more than the Volvo.  When looking at the Volvo make sure you drive both regular motors we found the base t5 to be under powered and noisy.  But for a few grand more the t6 engine is very quick and the transmission reacts much smoother than my Mercedes Benz e350.  The fuel economy has been surprisingly good for a larger SUV about 24 mpg.   I definitely recommend the active cruise control and cornering head lights both are great options and the kids love the very large sunroof.  The iPad interface takes some time to get used to, but everything is voice command also and the dash board also cam be customized to view whatever you want.  If you send some time with it everthing including changing its colors are customizable, maybe a bit too much.  I wish the auto on off would stay on the last setting used like most European cars instead of turning back on each time you turn the car on and you need to flip to a second screen to turn it, just not ideal.  The seats are very nice and designed to mold very well to your body, much more comfortable than my Benz or wife's old x3.  Overall I have been very impressed and would consider the up coming 90 sedan over replacing the E class with another E class if the features and ride are the same for less like the xc90 is.

We paid very little and upgraded to full autopilot up to 80mph, which is a nice option to have when caught in traffic.  No issues so far, only regular oil changes and some computer updates.

volvo,xc90,2016,KD, 06/20/2016,"Great ideas, but poor product support",3,"Everything about what this car is supposed to be or do is great.  However, there are a lot of bugs with the technology and the service department is not trained enough to deal with these said issues.  My car is less than a year old and is back into the shop, again.  It went into the shop on Thursday for what was supposed to be a minor software update.  It is now Monday, and I am still without my car.  Volvo technical support was contacted on Friday to address my situation, but I was told they are not good about responding on Fridays.  I am confused.  This is Volvo's flagship vehicle.  The service departments at the dealership do not have the knowledge or tools to deal with the car, and then the company's technical support dept starts its weekends on Thursday I guess!!  This is very perplexing.

volvo,xc90,2016,MEK, 03/06/2017,Bought Back as a Lemon by Volvo,1,"This car gave me problems almost every time I drove it. The car was a lemon and was bought back by the manufacturer. The list of things wrong with it is dozens of items long. Many of the problems were an inconvenience, but several of them actually made the car dangerous to drive. Volvo should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this model before all the bugs were worked out. The collision mitigation system was erroneously triggered on several occasions, which means that the car braked itself to a full stop while I was driving at speed and there was no accident imminent, the belt pulled me back into the driver seat and alarm bells went off, as well as the HUD flashed red lights. That was only ONE of MANY things that went wrong in the car. All of this with less than 3K miles. I will avoid Volvo at all cost for the rest of my life.

volvo,xc90,2016,Mythili Pisolkar, 04/24/2017,"Considering the hype about the Volvo brand, indeed",2,"I purchased this coming from a Lexus 400h expecting to be wow'ed. The test drive was good. The 360 view, the dashboard were fantastic looking and I was blown over. Post purchase, I began to uncover lots of common sense things that the car simply refused to do. Unlike the Infiniti, the 360 view is not attainable unless you go through several clicks and swipes on the very cool tablet/ipad like dashboard controls. The purpose of the 360 view is lost totally. The rear view can be replaced with the 360 view but then you lose the range of vision of the road behind you. 
Radio settings are made unnecessary complicated. Another example, the simple and easy windshield wipers. You would think they would have these automated down pat but no. Unlike the Lexus, you actually have to tell it that it is raining only after which it does some level of automated speed up and slow down of the wipers.
The service was ""ugh"" and ""aargh"" always - condescending disposition of the people and poor time estimation at the top of the problems. A supposed 45 minute wait became ""a few more minutes"", ""half hour more"", ""15 more minutes"" to three hours! There was one time when the service person told me that car pick up for maintenance will happen only if I was disabled in some manner which was an outright cooked up story. The service people behave as if they are high and mighty and want to show that they control who gets picked up and who doesn't. A simple reason such as, ""We don't have drivers or cars to pick up at that time"" would have been totally understandable for inability to pick up. Lexus service was soooo much better! These are registered complaints and I received apologies. I was okay the first time but some issue or the other came up which did not have to come up.
The router and the wifi is not of great strength as advertised for sure.
The Lane Assist detected white dashed lines only. The double yellow line and the solid white line were totally ignored.
To top all of this, the car self-braked many times for the wrong scenarios such as a car coming on the opposite lane, a parked car in a turn and didn't stop for a stopped vehicle causing a head-on collision and was totaled after 6 months of usage.
In conclusion, it comes with a few cool bells and whistles but it is not a well thought through car for overall execution. Service gets the lowest score. Truly disappointing.

In 36 months and 40,072 miles, it has been in the shop 13 times and left my wife stranded on the interstate once. In my 40 years of driving, I don’t think all of the vehicles I’ve driven combined have been in the shop for that many repairs. Everything from numerous software updates, changing the spark plugs, replacing both batteries, recalls to the instrument panel blacking out. The 3g WiFi is useless.

This last recall brok the GPS. It doesn't put me in the right city! Some features are there to configure but simply do not work... Do not try to disable the auto-engine stop feature. Although the option is there to select it or not, it doesn't do anything. Hope you like driving in comfort mode because, even if you can configure the driving mode at startup, the car will always start in comfort mode. So, you need to disable auto-engine stop and comfort mode everytime you get in the car! Volvo is adding new features to the software (Apple CarPlay)... How about fixing the software that is there and then add new things? As I said, this is my last Volvo.

volvo,xc90,2016,crabby hayes, 07/17/2016,A lot of car,5,"For as big as this car is, it handles surprisingly well. That said, I had planned on getting something smaller, but the ride comfort and technology (especially the great center display and fewer buttons) won me over. It is bigger than the Highlander it replaced, so my wife and I are still parking in the back corner of the mall parking lot - afraid to get too close to anything that might scratch our new car. It is great onthe open road, but a bit too much around town, My wife and I are still learning the new technology, which is a bit intimidating to a non-technophile. My wife couldn't figure out how to turn off the radio the other day, and needed to recruit a youngster to help (you just turn the volume down until you see the ""x"") - oh well. Controls are a bit quirky. I recently went to a car wash and when I got in the vehicle, both mirrors were folded in. I had to call support from the car. Needed to simultaneously push both mirror buttons and they returned to normal - just something to learn. After owning the car about 2 years, I noticed it was running a bit rough and my highway mileage had declined. After reading the manual and related articles, I started using top tier gasoline instead of the bargain stuff. Apparently upper head injection can get fouled. Once I changed, the engine smoothed out and my mileage got better. On my last long trip, I get nearly 30 miles per gallon.

This list of things that went wrong are too many to list, however my car was in the shop every couple months the first year. The worst part is the Volvo strung me along with my major issue being that there is a computer glitch on the 2016 model that is causing transmission problems. When you go to accelerate there is a major lag, and Volvo  just admitted to me after 6 months of dealing with this that they don't know how to fix it!

volvo,xc90,2016,North Bay, 01/27/2017,"30,000 mile review",5,"Just completed 30,000 miles. Despite a couple of electronic glitches, coupled with 2 recall notices, all of which were resolved during the normal 10,000 mile service intervals, I have to say that I am highly impressed with this vehicle . Bought from new and added every available option aside from the air-assist suspension and to be honest, the ride is fine. Quality of interior materials is top-notch. Not the most technically savvy individual though still managed to work out the majority of the screen based functionality within a couple of hours. Bottom line is that this is well built, stylish SUV that provides an amazing level of comfort combined with a strong sense of safety due to the numerous features that you would expect from a Volvo. In addition, with the rear seats down there is a serious amount of storage capacity, though should you be looking for a seven seater, the XC90 can accommodate without individuals having dislocate limbs to fit in the back seats.

Dealers response was "" should not have happened but it did""   Volvo covered the cost of the parts but it still cost us $63,00 in labor.  We told dealership if they stuck by their product, we would buy a new Volvo and be a customer for life.  They told us they were sorry but couldn't absorb the labor cost.  it is the last time we buy a Volvo.  we had 2 Toyotas that had no major problems for over 100,000 miles.

""Hybrid System Failure"" warning had it in the shop 8 days.  Parking brake failure and alarm had it in the shop 4 days.  The touch screen cuts in and out while driving, sometimes the windows won't roll down, it wouldn't shut off once.  Lots of electrical glitches.  The battery charge never charges more than 18 miles on the screen, but in reality the battery range is about 7-10 miles if that.  The gas tank is too small so I have to fill the tank each week even with the battery.  The interior is not well laid out - no storage space and the glove compartment barely holds my bottle of Advil.  I bought this car for a family vehicle but it is far from being family friendly.  It is not easy to move the seats up and down, not enough cup holders... DO NOT BUY THIS CAR.

There are other proven options that are better and more refined such as the Buick Enclave or Infinity (if you are hooked on premium fuel).

volvo,xc90,2016,Jim, 03/16/2017,Oh my god what a POS,2,"Consumer reports and Edmunds have this SUV totally wrong. In 9 months it's been in the shop 5 times, and has had 4 recalls and almost got me killed twice from safety installed technology features.  The software crashes more that a PC in the 90s.  Glitches in the software caused the entire dashboard and ipad system to go down when I was on the highway doing 70, then it locks up and wont go more than 30 miles and hour about getting me killed, has to towed in, takes 3 three days to get back and there only answer is we fixed it by updating the software?? Next the active collision system keep going of when car that are in the lane beside me slow down forcing my XC90 to abruptly break getting me almost rammed from behind 4 times. The brakes have been recalled and the transmission started locking up. entertainment system goes down and want respond almost every day and there is a delay in the car staring.  After 18000 miles the belts had to be replaced from fraying... This is a piece of software digital crap read reviews of this car from people who own. The technicians have no idea and it takes weeks to get parts. I'm begging you if you have children don't by this car,,, it's dangerous..Volvo is owned by company out of China and has all the quality of a product you would expect out of that country.

That said, I have owned 5 new Volvos in 12 years and the new XC90 is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors.

volvo,xc90,2016,CN, 03/02/2017,Mixed feeling after nearly a year of ownership,3,"My wife and I purchased the car last year after narrowing down the choices to this and an MB GL350 diesel.  I preferred the Benz, but this car was for my wife and she liked it better.  Between the two it is the better overall value option.  Ours has every major option except the trailer hitch and HUD.  Overall, it's been a good car, but there are some nagging design faults that really detract from it.  First up is the HUD.  I'm 6' 2"", and it was not possible to adjust the system to permit me to see it clearly; the top edge was always cut off, hence one of the reasons we didn't get that option.  Next are the seats.  They are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had to suffer through.  After nearly a year of driving it I still can't adjust them to a comfortable position.  The seat bottoms literally pinch my butt on the driver's side.  On the passenger side my tail bone sits directly on the seam for the extendable thigh support.  The lumbar support in the seat back can't be set in a position that works for me for long periods.  The seats in our car are the 'contour' models (I think); maybe the 'comfort' seats don't have these issues.  For me, the 2nd row seats are far more comfortable.  My wife is 5' 3"" and she doesn't have any issues with the seats.  My recollection is the Swedes are pretty tall, so why can't they make a seat that fits a tall person?  The next item is the cruise control.  The controls are backwards in that a single button press adjust the speed up (or down) by 5 mph, while press and hold adjusts by 1 mph.  These actions should be reversed.  The infotainment/electronic systems occasionally glitch, though software updates seem to have generally improved their operation.  The most serious glitch, experienced by me and my wife separately, has been the emergency braking warning going off for no reason, accompanied by the automatic emergency braking.  This occurred to each of us on the highway.  Fortunately, traffic was light during both instances, and the action was momentary.  Fuel economy is, frankly, lousy considering the engine size.  We're averaging around 21-22 mpg in mixed driving.  The best we've managed was about 25 mpg on a 450-miles trip.  Our Odyssey's engine is nearly twice the size and that car gets nearly 30 mpg on the highway.  And, it's a larger car (and weighs the same).  Compounding the low fuel economy is the ridiculously small fuel tank.  18.5 gallons?  Seriously? It should be at least 20, preferably more given the lousy economy.  Volvo really missed an opportunity by not offering a V6, or bringing the diesel to the U.S.  On the plus side, the infotainment system is easy to use.  The ride with the air suspension is sublime.  It feels like a tank.  Fit and finish, and materials are first rate and every bit on par (or better) than the Germans.  The biggest plus in my book, though, is that my wife absolutely loves the car, so it's a keeper.

Update - Mar-19
We're nearly three years into the car now and for the most part it's been good.  Service, though, is obscenely expensive.  We just had the 40k service done and it totaled $1700, which included new front brakes to the tune of $700.  The rear brakes were replaced at 30k miles and cost about the same.  Parts alone were $500, which is absurd.

The light gray leather interior is impossible to keep clean; just looking at it gets it dirty.  The seats continue to be terribly uncomfortable for me.  Interestingly, we were given a loaner that had the standard ""comfort"" seats and they were far better than those in our car, so it clearly is the poorly designed ""contour"" (who's body, because it certainly isn't mine?) seat that is the problem.  We have had a few pretty serious failures that were, fortunately, covered under warranty.  First was the pump for the air suspension.  It seized and left the suspension in park mode (a low-rider XC90 is not a
 comfortable ride!).  Replacement of that unit would have been around $1500 if we'd had to pay for it.  Both front struts were replaced for low speed popping.  This was apparently a known issue with Volvo as there was a service campaign for it.  Most recently was the dashboard.  Ours is covered with leather and it start curling around the defroster vents.  That resulted in a new one.  Software updates continue to improve some of the quirkiness in the electronics, so that's a plus.    

Overall, I continue to had mixed feelings about the car, but my wife still loves it, so we soldier on.

volvo,xc90,2016,Smokejumper, 02/21/2016,We wanted to love this car....,3,"The xc90 has a beautiful look to it.  When we decided to get rid of our Acura MDX, we tested several luxury SUVs.  Both my wife and I really favored the Volvo.  That is, until we drove it.  We wanted to love it so much that we returned for 3 test drives but in the end it was just underwhelming.  

The engine is underpowered and the driving experience was nonexistent, but we might have lived with that.  What really disappointed us was the interior.  Volvo was proud to tells us that their seats were designed by a medical doctor and took 6 years to complete.  Well, they really aren't that comfortable.  The interior felt like an empty box....Spartan appointments for a vehicle over 50k. The infotainment console is too far away from the driver and the system was unneccessarily complicated.   The positioning of controls did not seem to have a logical or ergonomic design.  Overall, the xc90 felt cheap and hollow.   Just how cheap was really apparent once we drove the BMW X5, Mercedes GLE and others in the luxury SUV class.  We felt it was very overpriced.

Our first test drive was the T6 Momentum. It was AWFUL! There was a horrible burning smell and a wicked vibration that made my husband feel carsick in the back seat. I changed with him and I started to feel carsick in the back too. The shifting was really rough, the acceleration was poor, the seats were not comfortable at all. The salesman ask if we would be willing to try another. I wanted to like this car so we agreed. We drove the R design. What a different experience, the contour seats are very comfortable, we drove it in dynamic mode which made a difference in acceleration, there was not a vibration. But we were still woozy from the first one so we have to drive it again. The biggest con for us is that there is no strap on the back of the 3rd row. It seems petty, but if you are going to have a car that can almost drive itself, why don't you put a strap on that back of the 3rd row so a shorter person can pull the 3rd row up and not have to climb in the back to push it up?

Since day 1, the voice navigation system has not worked.  The back-up camera doesn't always come on when you put the car in reverse.  The car stopped accelerating while I was driving and had to be towed to the dealership.  The foot-activated tailgate sensor doesn't work.  The climate control goes from barely there to hurricane force.  The touch screen has gone blank on multiple occasions.  The gas gauge doesn't provide an accurate reading of miles left in the tank.  I actually ran out of gas - I've been driving 30+ years and have never run out of gas - even as a poor teenager!  On multiple occasions the accident avoidance feature engaged - when there wasn't a car around me.  The a/c stopped working.  It has been in and out of the dealership multiple times - each time with the hope that the latest software update would solve the problems.  This last fix was supposed to solve the navigation issue.  The technician sat in the car with me and we tried to use the navigation and it switched me to the Music.  That was the last straw.

volvo,xc90,2016,William, 03/09/2017,One software issue after another,1,"I have this car for almost a year and I been back to the dealership 6 times for various software issues ranging from annoying (the sensus navigation and infotainment system freezing and rebooting) to inconvenient (locks not working, moonroof not working) to dangerous (entire dashboard blanking out including speedometer and tachometer and  auto-breaking going off without any other vehicles around).  The car itself is beautiful and very comfortable, but the software is quirky.   Volvo is constantly releasing software upgrades addressing these issues and other bugs, but you need to bring the car back to the dealership.  Expected much better reliability for the price.

volvo,xc90,2016,Joe Alutto, 04/24/2017,Still what we wanted!l,5,"The 2016 XC-90 rides well, has incredible comfortable seats, all 7 of them!  Cargo capacity is fine and acceleration a pleasant surprise given the relatively small engine.  MPG has been in the 23 mpg around town and 27-28 on the highway.  The dealer claims we can use regular gas but we have  been using premium as indicated in the user manual. There have been multiple software updates during the 48,000 miles we have used the car but the dealership has been very helpful in explaining what needed to be done and why.  The navigation system is no better than others we have experienced and voice control sometimes seems to only respond to a foreign language I do not know!  My wife and I love the car and hope to run it for many years as we have with all our cars.

volvo,xc90,2016,Franck, 10/28/2016,Four years loving our safe and thrifty hybrid T8!,5,"We already have a 2008 Volvo , which has been reliable and comfortable.  So we had no qualms about purchasing such an upscale Volvo.  The car is a joy to drive - the interior is an oasis of quiet refinement.  We read reviews before road testing, so were anxious to try this SUV with and without the air suspension. I must say, the ride quality and auto lowering for ingress and egress with the air suspension are fantastic.   We watched Youtube crash videos of the new XC90 and its competitors and came away convinced of Volvo's class-leading safety.  The new XC90 is packed with technology to improve safety and creature comforts, thus it took several weeks to learn all of our car's features.
After two years of ownership, our positive feelings about our XC() T8 are undiminished.  It has been completely reliable after resolution of several software glitches in our first three months of ownership.

We have been in the shop for a total of 2 weeks to fix Sensus which boots and reboots. Navigation that stops. Loud clicking noises every time you turn, stop and go. Fealership replaced wheel bearings but still have the  clicking issue and now the ride is horrible even after new tires etc.. as the vehicle shakes, rattles and rolls. I just took a very painful 8 hour family trip to Disney and now I am looking for my next vehicle. Pros. Good gas mileage, great interior layout with useable 3rd row seat. Love Sensus when it works. If the clicking could stop and the vehicle rode smooth like it did when first purchased then I would love it.

volvo,xc90,2016,Kelly Northington, 10/16/2017,12 months with 8 visits to the repair shop,2,"We had issue after issue with this vehicle. Main issues were the faulty control panel and the brakes. The vehicle would auto brake in the middle of the freeway for no reason almost causing multiple accidents. Also we had the break pads changed 5 different times for constant squeaking.

We had to have the brake system replaced in the first year (thankfully covered by warranty), but now have replaced the rear A/C condenser, engine mounts and now the from A/C condenser needs to be replaced about a week after the rear for $3200?  What else is next? Poor quality and Volvo corporate could care less."
volvo,xc90,2017,Run_Forest_Run, 12/12/2016,Really Nice Ride,5,"I traded in my VW Touareg Executive, which I loved, for the Volvo. I looked at the Audi Q7, Jag F Pace, and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Lexus don't like the look. BWM, Range Rover, and Benz are not client friendly. I have had 2 X5's and a Super Charged Range Rover (the big boy) so I have driven them extensively. Volvo really out did themselves with the XC 90. The car is super quiet, has a nice ride, the 4 cylinder engine is surprisingly good, and the XC is loaded with technology. Mine has the stock sound system, which frankly is excellent, I wouldn't blow the $2,600 on the upgrade unless you really are a hardcore audiophile. The HUD option, which I would not have ordered, was in the stock vehicle they had, it is okay, but you can't see it with polarized sunglasses! So that seems stupid to me. The self drive mode cool, but likely won't use much, the lane departure nudging constantly is a bit of an annoyance, but I will give it time to get used to. Headlights are insanely bright. The Ipadish controls are a nice clean look, easy to use, and overall seems like a nice option compared to say the Audi's control system and their ridicules pop up screen. This is a high end Crossover. If it is not on the list to test drive and check out you're leaving out a great vehicle.

volvo,xc90,2017,Doug Funston, 02/03/2018,After early hiccups car is performing as expected,4,"Mine is a virtually fully loaded T8 Inscription.   It looks, rides and performs (when it works) beautifully.   However, mine has been wrought with electrical/computer problems from the get/go.   It routinely spits out warning lights on various systems from ESC, engine, 12 volt system.   It has been in for repair (i.e not routine mtce) in one year more than my 2006 Mazda has been in its lifetime.   I am in my 60's and have owned many vehicles and this one has generated more warning lights in its short life than ALL my other vehicles combined.  Half the time software update is used by the dealer as the solution to my problems.   They almost never know what the update is supposed to solve.   My navigation system broke down on a cross country trip and required the dealer to reboot it.   Even my Tom Tom can be rebooted manually by me.   Finally replaced the module for the electric motor that drives the rear wheels claiming it was dragging down my 12 volt system and causing all these spurious computer generated warning lights.   The car worked fine for a couple of months and then one day it was completely dead (12 Volt) wouldn't even unlock the car.   Dealer claimed my less one year old 12 volt battery was faulty.   It was replaced.   So today 3 months later a  new warning light ""12 volt system service required"" has illuminated.   My issues electrically/computer are clearly still unresolved.   I cannot recommend this vehicle for its poor reliability.
Update August 2018.
Recently my car has performed well.   The issues with the 12 volt system while not resolved are now manageable.   I have multiple vehicles and I am retired.   I have discovered that this vehicle cannot sit for extended periods of time (a week?), or the 12 volt battery will drain.   The car will either be completely dead or the 12 volt system drained to the point of bringing in computer generated erroneous fault alarms.   This drain is due to the continuous high drain from the on board computer even when  the car is not running.   I can prevent this by ensuring the car is taken for a run every few days.   I have also purchased a jump starter just in case.
Update Feb 11 2019.   Since I have managed to get my 12 volt system performing as expected , the car has performed extremely well.

volvo,xc90,2017,Mark, 10/29/2016,Scandinavian test drive,5,"We picked up our XC90 in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2016. Volvo flew us over and back, picked us up at the airport, put us into a nice hotel, and provided a three course meal the day we arrived.  After taking us to the factory , we met our new car.  Our advisor went over it with us.  After a short test drive we had a Swedish meatball lunch followed by a factory tour. An amazing experience! 
We have had the car for four years now.  It has been reliable with no mechanical issues. Using battery power for regular work commuting and hybrid mode for everything else I’m getting about 36-37 mpg. It flies effortlessly through out Colorado Mountains. Getting into the car at the end of a day of work is like a cocoon that just comfortably wraps around me.  Unlike most cars after a few years, nothing rattles.  My only complaint is the Pirelli tires that came with the car only lasted about  30K miles.  I know that Consumer Reports gives it an unflattering rating but my experience with the XC90 can't be more positive.  I have owned Cadillac Escalade and SRX, and high end Suburbans but the Volvo is my favorite car.  Would I buy another one?  In a heartbeat!
"
volvo,xc90,2017,Anthony, 04/11/2018,A Worthy SUV,4,"I will start off by saying that I am a huge Volvo fan.  So when it came time to buy my new XC90 (T6 Momentum Plus), there wasn't much that was going to keep me from getting it.  Although, when I saw some of the reviews on here about software issues along with other ""nightmares"" resulting from new technology and bugs that weren't worked out.. I was a little apprehensive.  I decided to put my concerns to the side and take advantage of the year end close out deals and buy one.  I've been in the car for about 6 months now and have taken it all over Colorado and have been able to try it out in pretty much every driving scenario: traffic jams, countryside driving, mountain driving, rain, snow, icy conditions, etc.  After all of that I do have to say this car has been pretty much perfect.  My personal opinion is that other reviews about ""nightmares"" are not only exaggerated, but blown completely out of proportion.  This car's technology centers around safety, so if you're going to weave all over the road, drive it like a sports car, follow people too closely, or in other words drive like a moron.. this car is going to fight you (unless you disable the various safety systems) every step of the way.  I have slightly modified my driving style and find that all the technologies work as promised without any issues.  My first week of having the car I did have the auto brake engage when I was speeding up and getting too close to a car to change lanes but it didn't screech to a halt or anything like that.  It simply beeped at me and softly started to slow me down to avoid what it thought was an imminent crash.  It took me about a month to ""learn"" the car and adapt my driving accordingly.  Since that time everything has been smooth.  There are certain things that annoy me about the car that I do hope Volvo changes in the future, but they are minor issues.  For example, I love using the 360 degree camera as well as the parking features, but because I live in a busy city I don't have the time to stop in the middle of the road and swipe through 2-3 screens to select the feature i'm trying to use.  I wish they would add some shortcut buttons on the dash so I can quickly turn my 360 camera on/off or select a specific feature without having to swipe through a couple of menus first.  That part definitely gets old, but my overall enjoyment of the car as a whole outweighs those frustrations immensely.  It is extremely comfortable to drive, ride in, and it's a real head-turner to look at.  The gas mileage isn't bad, but I pretty much always keep the car in ECO mode unless i'm driving up into the mountains in which case I use Dynamic mode, and that makes the drive a real thrill.  I average between 19.5 and 21 MPG on a tank, and that is a mix of both city and highway driving.  When i'm going long distance on the interstate I average 23-26 MPG.  I do wish the fuel tank was a little larger, only getting 300 miles out of a tank before the gas light comes on means I have to get gas every single week.  Some of the other competing SUV's can get 400-600 miles out of a tank.
"
volvo,xc90,2017,bigmountain, 08/07/2017,Reserved Judgement,5,"We bought this car in February after multiple generations of 4 different luxury SUV's my wife and I were tired of 'feeding the pig' at the gas pump. We travel probably 18 weekends a year so gas mileage is important to us, but so is capability for off-road and snow performance. We researched this purchase at length. This car is beyond innovative. The interior and exterior design feels like a $100,000 car, not a 60k car.  Where this car shines: fuel economy, handling, long trips (the pilot assist feature is addicting), interior functionality, comfort, the Dynamic and Off Road driving modes are incredibly helpful when called upon. Where this car isnt great: ride, the ride is very busy and a little harsh which exposes some 'typical European car rattles' and will expose every Lego stuffed in a cupholder. This is a trade off to consider if you like the confidence of the handling on a backroad. The technology can be a little invasive at times when you are just out running errands, so you have to be willing to learn about it and use it properly or it will drive you mad. The only major complaint that I have with the car is the auto-stop-start feature which is way too overzealous to cut the engine off when you are at a quick 4-way stop or pausing to let someone pull out of a parking space. I am optimistic the software engineers will release a patch for this soon (hint-hint).
"
volvo,xc90,2017,Bookman, 09/27/2016,High Tech on Wheels but Keep Eyes on Road,4,"This car drives great and is as comfortable as my living room but the tablet-like controls are a challenge.  It requires eyes off road to scroll through the dozens of options; the driver mode default selection does not work, it always starts in Comfort even if you choose Eco or Dynamic (I saw this complaint in a review from 2016 model) and in order to switch between the modes you have to find the roller ball by the gear shift and turn it just right; should have a button or voice command to switch 'cause when you're getting on a highway and need Dynamic the last thing you want to do is fish for it.  Finally learned that you can control climate with voice commands so that's really cool and helpful b/c again eyes off road to change fan setting or temp.  A few times I turned fan up at start and it didn't catch, wondering what that's about.  Totally don't understand the auto climate feature.  And the navigation is terrible.  My former XC70's nav was amazing but this one asks for Street Number, Street and City in one command and then can't understand what you say and gives a crazy place back.   Should ask for each one individually like the XC70 did.   I am hoping all the technical stuff in the car lasts and no glitches develop with software.  Positives include the driving assist that helps keep me in the lane-very effective, and the media system offers lots of options like favorites, etc. which is fun.   So far the car is a total joy to drive and ride in and it looks great.

volvo,xc90,2017,Jack YM, 11/15/2016,I love it!,5,"This is my third week of driving Volvo XC90 and both my kids and I love it! I have been searching for a replacement for my Honda Odyssey for a while. I have compared Acura MDX, Audi Q7, Mercedes  GLE, and BMW X5. Eventually, I decided to have the XC90 and have to say that it has exceeded my expectation so far. Initially, I was thinking to buy a MDX given I have had a Honda before and for the value. However, I think the interior of the MDX is not as luxurious as one would expect and with all the options, it is not that ""value"" anymore, so to speak. Sometimes, people may have experienced ""buyer's remorse"" wishing you have bought a different car. It never occurred to me. As I said earlier, my kids love riding in this car and I feel good driving the car. The security features are excellent and are one of the main reasons I chose this car. The technology is super and the touch screen central display is very good, simple, clean, and works. One may need take time to learn how it works, just like using ipad or iphone. My car also comes with the ""red"" key which is nice if you have younger ones driving the car (additional safety features like limiting the driving speed). The only thing it took a little bit more time to make it work is the ""Homelink"" button for garage door opener. The instruction comes with the car doesn't help much. I went to the ""Homelink"" website and downloaded the instruction for this specific car. It worked on my first try. I wish it had come with the car a separate sheet/instruction on how to program the ""Homelink"" button given this would probably the first thing people would do once they drive the car home. Overall, I am very happy and pleased with the car."

volvo,xc90,2017,Chris, 10/05/2017,A computer that drives with software problems,2,"There is essentially an ipad in the car that controls almost literally everything.  Voice control is not reliable.  Many user complaints, including mine, are of strange behaviors all related to software and frequent software updates. Literally after owning my inscription 2017 XC90, I was driving and the heads up display moved, the A/C would not come on, the seat started filling with air on its own and my steering wheel buttons would not work to change radio stations or make phone calls.  No joke.  Today is the 3rd visit to the dealer in one month.  My problems are not unique.  Visit the forums and read.  Sad, its so beautiful and cool, it just doesn't work, you can't just get in an go.  You have to wait for everything to load and many apps simply fail.  So disappointing.  If you are an early adopter this might work for you but as JD Power pointed out already (2/5) it is very unreliable and operating the car is like driving the car while using your iphone for everything.  Its distracting and there are so many darn software bugs.

volvo,xc90,2017,Bill, 03/24/2017,Great Car with bad design flaw,1,"The XC-90 8T has a serious design problem. If the car sits long enough ( usually 7 to 8 days)  the car goes into  a sleep mode to protect the batteries. The result is the car is dead with no power available. The car must be entered using the manual key and the only way to start the car is to get a jump start. I am an international commercial pilot and go on long trips all the time. When I return I must get my airline's maintenance to give me a jump to start. Needless to say I am the joke of the airline and having to to this at 4am during blizzards in Chicago is a nightmare.

volvo,xc90,2017,Phil, 07/27/2017,Major Safety Issue,1,"On 7 different occasions, my new XC90 automatically and aggressively braked the car while I was driving on a highway because the City Safety collision avoidance system sensed that I was about to get into a head-on collision but there was never a car or object in front of me. The collision avoidance system is defective and brakes the car for no reason. Every time it happened I was driving on a highway and it's a miracle that I didn't get rear ended. Volvo was completely unhelpful in figuring out what was wrong. My car was in the service department for 60 out of the first 100 days that I owned it. Volvo kept telling me that they couldn't recreate the problem so there was nothing they could do. The service department at Volvo of White Plains was beyond unhelpful. They were flat out rude and dismissive of my concerns.  After several months of this problem, I went on the NHTSA website and found that several other people have reported the same problem. I then had to file the vehicle as a lemon under my state lemon laws. Volvo eventually repurchased the vehicle. This was the worst experience that I've ever had with a manufacturer. They never once took me seriously even though the car had a major safety problem and several other people have had the same complaint. I bought this car because I thought Volvo made the safest cars. I made a big mistake. Think twice before you buy this car.

volvo,xc90,2017,DJ, 06/11/2018,Not as good as it looks,3,"I bought a fully loaded 2017 T6 inscription with the bowers and wilkins sound system.  It’s now only 6 mo old. Yes, I’m writing a negative review because of my experience with this suv. But buyer should beware: this suv is not assembled and designed to the standards of the other luxury car I own (BMW X5 50i). Even our 2015 highlander was better put together. Yes, this is a beautiful car. And at first glance the inside is also nice. Here are the problems I’ve had 1) leather seats separate from the foam and crease 2) rattling from base from the stereo 3) second row seat siding mechanism broke with routine use!!! 4) infotainment system is slow and frankly it sucks not having jobs or buttons for quick functions 5) headliner was loose upon purchase and made an annoying chirping sound.  how about what’s not broken? 4 cylinder is loud, annoyingly loud. Ride is firm without the air suspension (only option I don’t have). Steering is great, better than my BMW and it feels good in the corners. It drivers like a European car. Safety is obviously Volvo’s strong point. Automatic breaking already saved me once. Fortunately I can’t vouch for all the features working in the background. This is an amazing looking car. The inside looks nice till you look up close.  It’s a great car to LOOK at but for the cost (north of $65,000 with the option I have) it just doesn’t stack up to my BMW in build quality. I’m really considering taking a loss and selling this thing. Afraid to see what happens at 1 year.

volvo,xc90,2017,SKA, 03/16/2017,great SUV but not atheletic,4,"We have very limited options for 3 row luxury SUV. Mercedes GLS is too big, BMW X5 3rd row is unusable. It boils down to XC90 and Audi Q7. Me and my wife both loved the exterior/interior of XC90. Eventually we ended up buying XC90 T8 Inscription with all possible options (MSRP was 85K, but we got good deal). Car is very quite and drives really nice and my wife swears for its handling. However I feel driving is boring. Acceleration is no where close to my Mercedes E350. May be I should not expect that but I want to let you know that don't get foll by 400hp rating. It is big/heavy car and you will notice it. It has about 15 miles electric only range and my wife loves electric only mode due to quietness (I feel it is sluggish in electric mode). in last 4 months I had to visit dealer twice. Once engine light came up and second because there is some rattling noise in center console. Dealer fixed engine light thing, but noise issue has not gone fully (it comes back only at certain speed). I feel it is due to air suspension and I have to live with it. I don't expect such thing in 85K car. If I have to buy again, I would buy T6, since it is 400lb lighter so will have better handling. T6 will be 15K cheaper too.

Now it has been one year since I have this vehicle. It has made two trips to dealer for various issues. One for temp sensor gone bad and another for battery cooling pump gone bad. It was also making creaking sound at center console which dealership fixed by putting some extra insulation. Now I hope everything is sorted out and just regular servicing will be needed in future. I have grown used to its driving characteristics. Driving experience is best at Sports mode. Everyone gives compliment for its looks.

volvo,xc90,2017,KJ, 06/24/2017,Perfect but serious software issues,3,"This is our 4th XC90 in 12 years (we always lease 3yrs at a time). This is also our first model since the major redesign in 2015. It's currently driven around 8000 miles and we have had severe software issues including: Random battery drainage caused by software issue (locked out 3 times), constant ""car is unlocked"" notifications in iPhone app even though the car is locked (false alarm), GPS offset where the car thinks it's 100miles from where it actually is causing random warnings when driving at 60mph where t thinks it's in a 25mph school zone etc., very unreliable cellular connectivity making Spotify and Pandora features pretty much unusable, occasional connectivity loss in a well covered area and many over random weird issues.

volvo,xc90,2017,C. Ayers, 10/08/2018,Avoid new models like the plague,1,"The new Volvo seduced us with it's looks, interior, technology, and promise of reliability.  A year later, I am reminded of when Mom said, ""looks aren't everything"".  In less than 12 months of ownership we've had the car in for warranty repair Iver a DOZEN times, for everything from windows leaking water to being towed in because the vehicle was broken in limp mode.  I won't detail e ery issue, but I will relate what a friendly color technician told me as we were performing a test drive - ""none of the new Volvos break the same."". For me, this indicates total quality issues with the vehicles, and I recommend staying away from the Geely generation of Volvos...unless you enjoy spending your time in service department waiting rooms.  Oh, and generally speaking the Volvo dealerships/service departments are lacking   in amenities when compared to other luxury brands (Florida), except for Hendrick Volvo in Charleston, SC, which is a flagship store.

I mean I have the air suspension with the 20” rims (when you get it fully loaded, they usually come 21” or more). I was specifically looking for a configurated model with 20” rims and air suspension thinking it will remedy or at least lessen the impact on bumpy roads, WRONG! Volvo has to change their strut suspension, it destroys everything beautiful in this car they built. Also, they have to work on inproving the gas mileage.

volvo,xc90,2017,Greg, 05/17/2017,one year of ownership,1,"I really wanted this car. I really expected it to be all I wanted in a SUV, stylish, comfortable, technologically advanced, with a semi-auto pilot function and reliable. All my expectations were and still not fulfilled. The car manifested noise level higher than normal since the beginning. Noise from the outside plus a cabin not soundproofed like competitors. The electronics promised wonders but delivered nightmares. The car main and driver screens continuously black out and takes forever to reboot. Once you start the car it takes longer than usual for the system to load, you cannot even engage the reverse right away and expect to see the camera: you have to waaiiiiiit. And the service says that is normal. Absurd. the semi autonomous driving is no better than the rest of the car. If and when it engages you might expect it to stop working without any warning. The handling and engine are up to par with the rest of the car: rubbish! I do not want this to get too long, so I will just conclude saying that the customer service is useless as the car itself. If you are in the market for this segment go with anything else but this car, it is plenty of great alternatives and I regret my purchase everyday.

volvo,xc90,2017,Michelle, 11/06/2017,"kids, dog and I and the Volvo XC90 Momentum",4,"We needed a 7 seater SUV, basically to separate the two kids and give the dog some extra space.  After owning the huge Mercedes GL, we decided on something a wee bit smaller but just as practical.  The two contenders ended up being the new Volvo XC90 and the Audi Q7. We had an Audi Allroad which we loved to drive, but the back seat was becoming far two cramped for our nearly teenage son. We found the same to be true about the Audi Q7, as big as the car was, there wasn't a lot of leg room in the backseats.  The Volvo XC90 had far more leg room in the backseats and was more comfortable to drive in for long distances. (SF to SD is 10 long hours.) And the third row was much more comfortable, according to our preteen. My hubby calls is it the perfect mom car, he drives an BMW X5 for reference, compared to his car I love the smooth comfortable ride and acceleration.  The seats are comfortable to be in for long hours of driving and I don't feel like I need to see the chiropractor after going over continuous speed bumps or bumpy surfaces.  He does find the find the contoured seats a bit confining at 6'4"" with a bit a girth on the sides and it did limit us to getting the R version which I really liked.  The only downfall is that our XC90 has spent a crazy amount of time in the shop. Not purely sure that is the cars fault though, as our garage gives a loaner, and sometimes I think it is just easier for them to get through the amount of work they need to get done on cars if they keep our Volvo a few more days. My husband does call me the Beta tester though. So far we have had our supercharger malfunction, which is always fun at toll booths that are slow down but please don't stop and accelerate like made when done.  Our battery went before a year, if your car starts doing really crazy things it might be time for a new battery. And our USB port stopped working, not good when you have preteens. But overall,  we have been really satisfied with the car. The only major complaint we have is that the back row is not electric, so it requires a bit of work to navigate the seats, including the middle row. We don't move the middle row around enough to remember exactly the sequence we need to work in to facilitate the seat doing exactly what we want.  It tends to get stuck in sometimes crazy positions. At the end of the day, I have been really happy with our Volvo XC90.

It is so comfortable, easy to drive, easy to park, and functions wonderfully!!   Not quite as fast off the mark as my old car, but catches up fast.  Haven't been for service yet, but love that three years of service is included in the purchase price, much better than expensive services at Mercedes.  So far, so fun!  Bought it in Nov. 2017.

volvo,xc90,2017,Mary, 03/18/2017,"They used to emphasize safety, now its tech",3,"Be aware that In their bid to jump into the LUXURY SUV market Volvo has only managed to make a its XC90 unnecessarily complex with potentially dangerous Intrusive technology. There are virtually no control's that operate by knobs and the 3 screen tech that controls Everything is Very distracting and more inefficient. Our old XC 90 (2013) was totaled while parked and we jumped into the new model expecting more if what we had loved about Volvo for the last 20 years- We were wrong! I am very computer literate but had to sit in the car & take notes to change some of its worst features. In a bid to Warn the driver of hazards, the overly controlling tech (beeps, noises, etc) is itself a hazard. If I could trade it for a new 2013 I'd stay with Volvo. Next time we are looking at American made non-luxury SUV's.

volvo,xc90,2017,Pam Nichols, 10/09/2016,Very happy!,5,"I've never had a perfect car for me but this is quite close. My husband refused to ever drive an SUV but he loves this car. He's always looking for an excuse to drive. It has power! There are lots of extras in the inscription that are worth the extra money. I like the larger tires and leather quality especially. My kids love the car too and prefer to ride in the ""way back"". Some of the technology is tricky but you do get the hang of it and there are so many features that it's worth the effort to learn it.

volvo,xc90,2017,Mike, 08/17/2016,2017 XC90 T6 Inscription - 6 weeks into Ownership,4,"One of the irritations I have is the disconnect between the 2017 Owner's manual and Volvo's support.  They list functions in the manual that just flat out are not there nor are available.  Seems somewhat dishonest to me.  For example, Volvo lists how to use the egress / ingress function for getting out of the SUV and into the SUV.  However, when I contacted Volvo, they said this function is not available, never has been and maybe under development as a future software upgrade.  Not sure how they can put the option in print when they don't even have it developed.  Second example is the manual shows a 110v outlet in the center console for passengers in the 2nd row to plug in devices.   However, that was only available in their 2016 model, again, according to the email I got from Volvo.  However, the manual is titled ""2017 XC90"".  I have found two other functions that are not available in the XC90 US model but available in Canada.   One would think they would have defined that better up front.  Thus, owners beware, Volvo isn't totally honest in what is / is not available in the 2017 T6 in the US.  As for the car itself.  I didn't get the 4 corner suspension (I ordered it but for some reason (either dealer or Volvo error) it didn't come with it.  However, the ride is comfortable and about the same as in our 2011 Chrysler Town and Country.   Gas mileage is ok, I'm averaging around 22 mostly in town.  Best gas mileage is in cursing mode.  It really sucks the gas when taking off and probably is where it falls short a little.  Does have some great safety features but also falls short.  For example, the lane assist where it is to alert you if you drift to far left or right, is not reliable.  There are times when it should have alerted but easily let me cross the center line either having no notification or late in notifying me.  Hence a head-on-collision would have already taken place.  My 2014 GMC 1500 truck has the same feature and works perfectly all the time.  Not sure why a $75,000 vehicle doesn't have the same accuracy.  Pilot assist works as designed. As long as the lane markings can be identified, it does auto steer the car up to 80 mph.  You do have to interact with the steering wheel every 30 -45 secs however or it will auto disengage.  The scary part is that there are times when the system, apparently, looses the ability to see the lane markings and just disengages without any warning to the driver.  I would think, again, for this high end vehicle, it should alarm if the system is disengaging.    Thank goodness I have not had to test the auto braking if a car turns in front or to avoid a rear end collision.  I'm assuming it will work when required.  The active cruise adapter works well and you can set the distance (actually set the secs) within which you want the car to adjust the speed based on the car in front.  The seats are very comfortable but getting in and out of the vehicle is difficult unless you retract and lower the seat.  I'm 5' 10"" and if I don't lower the seat all the way done, I will hit my head getting out.  Climate controls work well as do the ventilated / heated seats.  2nd row seating is about as comfortable as in other vehicles.  3rd row quite frankly is limited to children.  Very difficult for adults to get in and out of the back.  Not adult friendly.  As with reviews of the 2016 model the lack of USB ports is a glaring deficiency in a high vehicle in this price group.  Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle but would I buy it again, I don't know.  I would look closer at the new 2017 Mercedes I think.

volvo,xc90,2017,Lynn, 09/25/2017,"My 2016 XC90, 2018 XC90, 2018 S90 Plug-In Hybrids",4,"My first indication of problems to come was the check engine light was on when I purchased the car.  It took two days to resolve originally and then it recurred several more times, which required a visit to Volvo each time. I have a love/hate relationship with this vehicle.  I love, love, love the interior design and features.  There is great mood lighting, an excellent sound system, comfortable seats, classy styling, touch screen, AUTO PILOT (the best thing ever in Southern California traffic - I'll never buy a car without this feature again), parallel parking assist, second row seat adjustment for larger/smaller passenger leg room and much more.  Twice my car auto braked and likely saved me from accident, so thank you Volvo, but many other times as I am driving in a residential street it dings loudly with an orange bar code.  It falsely alerts me and sometimes even breaks slightly, that I am going to hit a parked car that I am no where near.  It scares me each time it does this.  My moon roof poured water in the second row of my car when I took it to the Costco car wash.  This fix (replacing the moonroof and making adjustments) took about a week.  I have had multiple issues with temperature control systems, both requiring extended visits (about a week each time) at the service shop, while they ordered parts and made repairs.  My seat belts, seats or whatever squeaks as I am driving down the road.  It's like nails on a chalkboard.  I've been in several times for this and now I just give him.  My quiet Volvo riding experiencing now has me twitching at the sounds.  I have continuous issues pumping gas (they made a repair for a check engine light on a fuel related issue, just not this issue) where the pump clicks off and I cannot tell if my tank is full.  I'm scared to keep pumping as gas will spill out, so I stop and fill up at another gas station or another occasion.  Volvo offered to buy my car back and it has been a very smooth process, so much so, that I will be purchasing a 2018 XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.  I am hoping they have worked out some of the glitches.  Fingers-crossed...

Update, 1/8/18!!!  I have been in my new 2018 Volvo XC90 Plug-in Hybrid Inscription for several months and I reached 3,400 miles before my check engine light came on.  What a huge disappointment! As luck would have it, my thermostat needs replacing (a 3-5 day repair estimate).  This is EXACTLY the same issue as on my 2016 XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.  You can’t make this stuff up!  Buyer beware of the mechanic/computer problems on this car.  They are real!  My service advisor told me that they haven’t seen this issue on other 2018 models yet (I am one of the first buyers in my location of this model year).  

Update:  June 2018, 2018 XC90 - Suspension needed work at about 10,000 miles. 

Update:  7/11/18 2018 S90 Plug-in Hybrid - Our family also purchased a new 2018 S90 Plug-In Hybrid a few months ago. At approximately 4000 miles the check engine light came on causing a fix to the you guessed it!!!  The temperature control system...  The car died again after the repair, literally, requiring it to be towed to the local dealership.  It took several weeks for all of these repairs while the very nice local service shop waited for return calls and updates from Sweden.  With the time change, this is an extremely inefficient business model resulting in multiple day repairs (often weeks with the plug-in hybrids).  We have now owned three of them, so all three have had problems with the temperature control systems.

volvo,xc90,2017,DS, 02/03/2018,Great SUV but warranty is useless,2,"I had this SUV for little over 9 months and 6K miles on it. My wife does not drive it very much as she uses a vanpool to get to work. We did not spend much time exploring this cars features. We did realize after nine months that the car actually had a coin holder :( and that the door to the coin holder was stuck. Took it to the dealer Momentum Jaguar Volvo in Houston where I bought it from and explained the issue. They kept the car for a day and said they had to order a part to fix it and told me it will be a warranty repair. Next day they call me to tell me that it won't be covered by warranty because the door was stuck because of a spill. I explained it to them that we had not used the car very much and that's the way the coin holder was until we realized it was a coin holder. If they left it at that I would have gladly taken the car back. They took out the center console and wanted $400 install it back. When I looked at the disassembled center console I did see some spill on to the sides of the console but nothing actually in the coin holder door mechanism. It looked like the dealer wanted to just charge me $690 to replace the coin holder because volvo does not reimburse them that much if it was done under warranty. They even called volvo customer care and made sure I cannot preemptively talk to them and have it replaced under warranty. I even purchased an extended warranty through volvo for this car. And all volvo and the dealer wanted to do was cut corners by claiming the damage was caused by the spill when actually there was no water damage to the coin holder itself. They won't admit that it was defective to start with. All this for replacing a $90 coin holder. I would recommend people looking into buying this car to make sure what kind of service the dealer will provide after the purchase. Reade reviews about the dealer service department before purchasing, because most of the headache with volvo cars is dealing with dishonest dealers service department. Your warranty is as good as nothing because it is the service advisors discretion in deciding if they want to do it under warranty. They will cook up some reason to not repair even warrantable items because they can charge the customer more than what Volvo would reimburse them.

volvo,xc90,2017,JT, 09/17/2017,Buyers Be Very Aware!!,1,"Oh, were do I start? I will keep this short. DO NOT buy a new model year Volvo XC90. Our first 2016 XC90 was in the shop more than we drove it. Volvo ended up buying it back from us. The problems are too many to list, but range from dashboard and info screens going dark (while driving), auto park feature wanting to engage when stopped at a stop light, exhaust noises during acceleration, AC not working properly from time to time, the $2,600 B&W sound system who's speaker grills rattle more than anyone should tolerate and driver profile settings not working/syncing with the key fobs, acceleration is jerky and anything but smooth (we have the Polestar performance chip installed) and various infotainment glitches.

Now the kicker, Volvo wanted to keep us ""in the family"" and worked a deal to get us a new 2017. LOL, this one has the same issues and has been in the shop 5 more times, with one of those service appts lasting 4 weeks. Also, it gets terrible gas mileage (15 mpg city-20 mpg hwy) and the ride is so stiff it’s worse than driving my BMW with the sports suspension pkg. You feel EVERY bump and crack and not in a good way.  The whole driving experience is like a twitchy, nervous gazelle before a lion feeding frenzy.
Don’t believe all the reviews that paint a glorious picture after driving this SUV for a few hours. The designers, engineers and Volvo management should be ashamed of the car they approved and built
I wish we would have walked away after the first one was returned.  Now I see why the original Volvo company went bankrupt.

volvo,xc90,2017,peachking9, 07/31/2020,"Not at all what I hoped for, worst car ever.",1,"     I just finished my lease on a 2017 XC90 T6 Inscription AWD with the Polestar Package. After owning this vehicle for three years, I can say with confidence that this car should be avoided at all costs. 
     The amount of times it was in the shop for ""software updates"" and even a leaking exhaust system was concerning, not to mention the woeful build quality issues my vehicle had. The rear driver's side door was not aligned properly, to the point where excessive buffeting occurred in the car at highway speeds. Moreover, all doors began to rattle in their openings on regular road surfaces around 10,000 miles. The 21 inch wheels on my car looked great, but did absolutely no favors for ride quality, even with the air suspension option. 
     The bad ride made using the Sensus system very difficult unless I was parked, and I have had experience using iDrive, MMI, CUE and Comand/MBUX systems from competing brands. 
The fact that nearly all of the most frequently used controls (climate control and seat heating/ventilation) were placed in the screen was very frustrating, especially because the screen is so laggy and has small icons. The lack of power folding second and third row seats, and even a power steering column adjustment was insulting, and I wish I had caught those missing features before I signed the lease. 
     Another huge design flaw was the placement of the rear climate controls, which would always be interfered with by the front passenger's elbow when they would rest it on the armrest. The bumping of the said passenger's elbow would trigger the fan to go full blast and create a lot of excess noise in the already loud cabin. The fan speeds in this car are not gradual enough; it's basically full blast or no air flow at all. I also had the joy of dealing with whistling air vents in the front row for the duration of the lease. 
     The Pilot Assist feature was one of the items that sold me on this car, but I lost all trust in it when it nearly pulled me into a division wall on the freeway with no warning. In addition, the front emergency braking activated on its own a few times in the last few months, when there was no imminent threat of an accident. I have grown to not trust this vehicle with my safety, let alone my family's. I am now happily driving a different brand completely.

volvo,xc90,2017,Dave D, 01/06/2018,T8 Excellence is best Hybrid SUV,5,"Bought a 2017 XC90 Excellence and really like the cabin divider that keeps interior quieter and stops wind from blowing into passenger space when hatch is open. German Shepherd fits nicely in either rear bucket seat with thigh extender out. Seats are extremely comfortable and include awesome massaging. Auto park and brake set or release is great feature. Safety technologies all included and really like active lane keeping as well as adaptive cruise. More than enough room in back for shopping and luggage even with having an Fpace spare space saver tire in case of flat laying on cargo floor (nearly exact diameter vs Volvo’s spare is 4” smaller). About 31 mpg in 6300 miles which is incredible for a 5300 lb SUV with 400 hp. Charges in two hours at 240V so do it several times a day. Remote climate start is perfect for dog on hot days. A lost car glitch on nav map was easily fixed by resetting Sensus system per screen option. Air suspension lowers car automatically. The list of great features goes on and on. Highly recommended plus Volvo included maintenance for 30000 miles or 3 years. An incredible vehicle and highly recommended!

volvo,xc90,2017,Gary, 08/30/2018,Great for open road,4,"I have had my 2017 Inscription for 14 months and just did my 20,000 mile maintenance.  I live in Kansas and drive mostly on highways so after learning to use them I really enjoy all the safety features. I have driven it for 8-10 hours at a time and can relax and am not tired at the end of the day. It’s a cruise vehicle. I can carry my children and grandchildren in the car and feel safe and comfortable. I average 23 mpg. My only complaint is the fuel system which does not have a cap thus have had problems with vapor leaks causing check engine lights (I blame government EPA regs). If you want a performance machine it’s probably not for you but if you want a safe cruiser and learn to use the systems it’s great. "

Warning symbols appear with no explanation to be found in owners manual, electric socket (used to be for lighter) can’t handle an iPhone, the fuse blows- what’s it for?, only one USB socket so can’t charge more than one device on long road trips, volvo service rips you off on prices for anything not included in routine maintenance, back seat tiny and uncomfortable.

volvo,xc90,2017,BCWatty, 08/25/2017,Standard suspension is WAY TOO HARSH!,2,"Make sure you can live with the suspension, I could not deal with how harsh the ride was and traded the car after 8 months and 14K miles.  You know how some cars are better than the sum of its individual parts (VW GTI, for instance)?  This car has all the right parts, but, the vehicle made me feel like a beta tester - the computer which controls everything is too slooooooow - a trip for service had the software updated, but the computer got slower, not faster.  Too much intervention with touch screen required to perform the simplest functions, and it is slow to react.  The sensors go off randomly which flabbergasted me with trying to get them to just shut up!  The rear seat belts constantly rattle against hard plastic, which drove me crazy, too.  The dealership experience is not up to the standards of its peers, either.  The design of the car is beautiful, but it just needs more refinement to be competitive.  It is my fault I did not pay enough attention to the suspension during my test drive - my other car is a Ford Mustang, which has a much smoother ride experience.  Either pay for the upgraded suspension, or know it will try to beat you to death with the standard suspension.  I had such high hopes and am disappointed the car failed to meet my expectations.

volvo,xc90,2017,Travis, 01/17/2018,"Love your Volvo, it may save your life!",5,"As a car enthusiast having owned many cars - including an current model Escalade, Audi RS7, Mercedes CLS 550, BMW650 Gran Coupe, Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT and many other cars - none blend the styling, comfort, price and safety technology this Volvo has.  But this isn’t for those who don’t like technology or struggle to stay centered in the lane - this is made for those who love technology, like safety and design and are proud to drive something a little different.  The infotainment system does have a delay when it starts - it takes about 10 seconds.  The ride isn’t as plush as a 60’s Cadillac - I wouldn’t recommend springing for the 22” wheels - the 20’s will ride better (but don’t look as snazzy).  The 2.0 liter engine has almost 44 bars of pressurized air from the turbo and supercharger (that is a lot of boost) and per liter is more powerful than the Audi RS7 - in a family SUV.  With all that boost the engine has plenty of power - but isn’t as smooth as your regular non boosted v6 engine that dominates this segment of SUVs.  No, this is an SUV made for someone who enjoys driving, having an experience and can understand that some character is what makes a Volvo unique.  If you want a Toyota Highlander or Ford Explorer - go get one.  If you want a cool German SUV - get one of those.  If your values of safety, technology, being friendly to our planet and having a fun and unique driving experience matter - get the Volvo.  Plus - when that other driver runs a red light and moments before the impact are you going to wish you were in an XC90, the safest SUV made?  With a zero percent fatality rate according to the IIHS, the results speak for themselves.

Roomy interior, but not everyone fits a small seat.

UPDATE: Fuel economy is very good, 17 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on open highway. I love all the safety features including ""Deos the driver need a break"" if you cross the line too often. For big men the seats are narrow, but for smaller women their fine. Cargo space is very roomy and convenient .  Overall it is a very good purchase and is still unmatched by any other car for safety.

Too much cost cutting in poor quality materials. In the past the quality of steel used in Volvo's were second to none. Today, can not say the same. Ride is comfortable, yet quality better in other equivalents. Hopefully, once they begin assemble in Charleston SC, overall quality will improve to compete against BMW. Not yet there. However, in this case looks are deceiving. As for performance, a gas guzzler for the size and type. Do not waste your money or patiently wait.

My only wish so far is not having the B&W sound system as the standard system lacks the range I was expecting. Fit and finish are well executed.    I can say that I enjoy driving it on a daily basis, would recommend it and would purchase it again.

volvo,xc90,2018,David, 09/12/2017,Wife Still Loves the Car After 2 Years,4,"Purchased the car new in July 2017 and have 38,000 on it now (March 2020). My wife is the primary driver. She said she'd buy another one, if we don't go electric for her next vehicle. The only issue we had was at around 30,000 the check engine light came on and long story short we needed to have the injectors replaced. Fortunately it was all covered under the warranty. We also had an issue with a plastic handle coming apart on two separate occasions on the floor panel covering over the spare tire well. Both times it was taken care of under warranty (the first time it was repaired and the second time it was replaced). The vehicle has been very reliable. We like the Volvo App. The remote start works very well, especially good for the upstate NY snowing winters. HVAC is good. Sound system is good. Leather seating looks brand new. Paint is likewise like-new. The combined MPG has increased slightly from just under 20MPG to 21MPG. On trips it does deliver between 27 and 28MPG. Plenty of flat cargo space -  great for our tent camping trips. The 21 inch tires aren't inexpensive to replace, but their price has been coming down since more vehicles now have 21 inch wheels. The ride remains good.  We've used it to tow U-Haul trailers and have had no issues with it. Good ground clearance and drives well through snow/ice, with dedicated snow tires. Over-the-air updates to the car have worked properly. No issue with any of the electronics so far. Headlights are very good (active). No issues with the auto-cruise control or the semi-autonomous driving. We really like the driver's seating position.

volvo,xc90,2018,HLynn, 06/08/2018,Not reliable for the price tag,3,"I purchased the 2018 XC90 T8 Inscription in August 2017 with most of the bells and whistles minus the upgraded sound system.  I chose the hybrid mainly because of the added acceleration and the ride of the car with the air suspension package. I get on average 27mpg but have gotten as high as 40mpg in town. It would probably average in the 30mpg range if I remembered to plug it in every night. We don't travel in this vehicle and I normally put less than 10,000 miles a year on my cars.  I have been pleased with the interior.  It is luxurious and I find the seats to be very comfortable.  I like the simple and elegant design without all of the buttons and dials. My biggest disappointment with this vehicle has been the reliability.  My first incident occurred within a few months of purchase.  I got a Reduced Engine Power light as I was backing out of the garage to take my son to the Dr. which was less than a mile from my house.  As I did not need to accelerate over 35mph I decided to risk driving it which was, admittedly, a mistake.  As I was pulling out to cross 2 lanes of traffic the car just stopped and went into what is known as ""limp mode"".  Google this and read what other people have experienced.  It is very distressing to me that a car can just lose power and stop while you are driving because of what I was later told was a software issue.  I had to have it towed on a flatbed and the dealer kept it for about 4 days.  They updated the software and told me the issue should be resolved.  My next issue occurred last Friday. I was out to dinner and when I got in the car to drive home I got a light that said Hybrid System Failure-Service Required with an engine light on.  My husband chose to drive the car home but, once again, I had to have it towed to the dealership on a flatbed the next morning.  The car has just under 7,000 miles.  It was in the shop M-Th.  The dealership again reloaded some software which fixes the issue 60% of the time ""per Volvo"".  Volvo requires the dealership to try this first. If I continue to have problems in the future they will probably have to replace the IGM module.  As a side note, in both instances the dealership was unable to offer me a loaner and both times they had my vehicle for 4 week days.  The irony hit me as both times the car was being driven away on a flatbed my husband said to me, ""That sure is a beautiful car.""  I thought to myself, ""Yes, it is beautiful when it runs."".  For $75,000+, there are other beautiful and more reliable cars.

volvo,xc90,2018,Paul, 01/09/2018,XC90 Beats the competitors,5,"Continued review after 2 years of ownership:    I am continuing to enjoy the XC90.  It is a superb vehicle to travel in with the wife and dogs.  Highway gas mileage runs between 25.4 and 27 depending on how fast I drive.  The only time I have had it in the shop was for the 10,000 mile services.  Disappointing were the Pirelli tires which only lasted 30,000.  When I do trade I think I will move up to T8 so I can drive on battery in city fuel.  I think the new generation XC90 is probably the best Volvo built.  I would recommend it most certainly.

 

I, like many other owners of Volvo's have owned other premium vehicles and most certainly cross shopped for the best value, durability and drive-ability before purchasing a Volvo.  Having owned MB, Lexus and other vehicles I have always had a Volvo in the garage.  This is my 13th and can honestly say that for all but 1 have earned my appreciation for durable vehicles.  I have driven this XC90 for 6,000 miles both in good weather and bad and an equal amount of time in town driving and on the interstate.  The following are my thoughts and pros and cons: PROS - 1) excellent drive-line (don't worry about this SUV only having a supercharged/turbocharged 4 cylinder motor.  It is equal to or better than competitors 4 cylinder and some V6 motors ).  Very strong engine with plenty of on ramp and passing power.  Fairly quite even under hard acceleration. Shifts are smooth and it is hard to tell when the transmission is shifting.  I found the car to be very well damped and smooth even though I have the optional 21 inch wheels.  2) MPG is as advertised so their were no surprises there. 3) ergonomics are in a class by themselves as Volvo has always been known for their comfortable seating and the XC 90 does not disappoint.  Anyone owning German autos will know what I'm talking about because seats in MBs and BMWs are like sitting on concrete and become uncomfortable after a couple of hours.  Audi seats are a little more forgiving but not by much.  The closest comfortable seat to a Volvo is Lexus.   All controls fall easily to hand in the XC90.  Second row seating is comfortable with the seat backs ability to recline, plenty of knee room and the foot-wells are large enough for folks wearing bulky shoes or boots.  Third row seating is easily accessed but not much room for adults.  4) Infotainment - I found the SENSUS system to be intuitive and easy to use.  Take the time to spend a couple of hours learning the system and you won't be disappointed in what is offered in the way of information, audio, wi-fi, climate control (all three sections) navi, forward and backup camera's etc.  4) Lighting -  I really enjoy the LED headlights (swiveling) and fog lights angles.  The fog lights illuminate to each side of the vehicle extremely well.  The interior lighting is fantastic and I like the ability to change the colors as well as the strength of the lights.  Back up lighting is superb. 5) Maintenance - It is great to have service covered vs paying huge maintenance fees.  I have had the car back to the service dept one time for a software upgrade but other than that the SUV has been bullet proof.  No rattles, squeaks or groans in the cabin. No problems with SENSUS.   I call the cabin the ""cone of silence"".  CONS - 1) SENSUS -  sometimes can be slow to process upon initial start up.  It can take up to 10 seconds for the software to wake up and all applications to activate.  I wish the backup camera was not part of the infotainment system.  Volvo would be wise to separate the camera from the rest of SENSUS.  A minor irritant, but one nevertheless.  2)  We like that there is wi-fi connectivity but set up through AT&T was not an easy on-line process.  I ended up spending an hour or more via phone with a AT&T representative to get connected. Not much more to report at this time.  Sounds like I'm writing an ad for
 Volvo with so few CONs but truly for me this SUV is a delight to drive with no bad surprises.  Most certainly the best built Volvo I have owned.  PS: Friendship Volvo, Bristol, TN is one of the best Volvo dealers I have ever dealt with both stateside and while I lived in Germany.  Matthew Ratcliffe, sales associate, is fantastic to work with and the service department is exceptional (they have serviced 4 of my other Volvos)

volvo,xc90,2018,Dave, 09/02/2017,First time Volvo owner.,4,"Full disclosure, I've only owned my 2018 XC90 Denim Blue Momentum for less than a week, so I can not speak to long term durability issues. So far so good, but fingers crossed. My initial reaction as a former diehard Grand Cherokee owner (5 in a row) is that a I am very happy with my purchase. The looks of the XC90 really caught my eye, but the interior quality sealed the deal for me. I had reservations about the 4 cylinder, but a test drive alleviated my concerns that it would b sufficient for th size. While it is by no means going to be mistaken for an 8 cylinder, I am impressed by the 316hp output especially at highway speeds and would describe the output as a solid v6 caliber. My Summer daily driver is a Z06 Corvette so, the road noise, and ride comfort are fine for my tastes. I sincerely wrestled with the idea of owning a Volvo, but the exterior looks and interior quality rival other luxury SUVs going for 10's of thousands more. I wanted a car with better fit and finish, more 2nd row legroom, roof rack and the third row was a bonus. I looked at the Cayenne and Q7. Performance wise, the XC90 is subpar, but for the money I could not beat everything this had to offer. The dash tech is fantastic and I'm just starting to get to know the lane assist, adaptive cruise, and pilot assist features, and they are impressive. While the 316hp output is impressive, the 4 cylinder is a bit ""tinny"" sounding...with an almost Diesel engine exhaust note. The base suspension is a tad rough, and the cockpit is not what I would call quiet. Road and engine noise does come through. Again, with all that I'm very pleased in large part to the deal I got. I had the benefit of getting $2500 Volvo ""conquest"" cash and $750 from Costco, on top of an insanely good trade in value on my Jeep (month end, slow night). I parted with a v8, adjustable ride height, quieter cockpit and I'd argue smoother ride, but gained increased driver / passenger space, better interior quality, stunning exterior, smooth tech interface, 4 years of VolvoOncall (Onstar like), increased safety features and amenities. I'm looking forward to a road trip to get to know it a little better. The only complaints I have trouble justifying at this price point is no cooled seats and no where to put your sunglasses...other than in the armrest. But far from deal breakers.

volvo,xc90,2018,Jenna O, 05/14/2019,I wanted to LOVE this car,1,"I owned THREE XC90s. Not a typo. THREE! I purchased my 2016 which had 2 sets of brakes and 2 sets of rotors, a leaking sunroof, and multiple fails on electronics before Volvo replaces my car with a 2017 version. The 2017 version was great, except at 37k miles when the engine had multiple failures. One of them occurred downhill on a mountain with my family in the car. Terrifying. After a month of no vehicle and going through a lawyer a second time, Volvo replaced my car with a 2018. At 33k miles my vehicle began having transmission issues. They would temporarily resolve with computer updates and then go back into slipping. After speaking with volvo, they said it was normal wear and tear. I decided I was done. I was paying for a car that spent more time in the shop than when I had it. I couldn’t do it anymore. I’ve driven Volvo’s my whole life, but I believe since being purchased they simply aren’t the cars they have always been known to be. They technology and safety is impressive, but if the car has so many faults daily, can you trust it will be safe when you need it to the most?

volvo,xc90,2018,Andy, 11/07/2017,"Best SUV, most awarded large SUV for a reason",5,"On top of reviewing the car itself, I will also provide quick a review on the brand's Oversea Delivery program (OSD).  First, about the vehicle itself, one of the best 7-seater SUVs on the market.  In its class, the only competitor is Audi Q7. And to configure the Audi Q7 with similar equipment including full digital dashboard, semi-autonomous pilot assist feature, upgraded interior and sound systems, heads up display and others, the Q7 will run at least $5-8K more.  So in terms of value alone, XC90 is a more sensible selection.  I realize that even with the XC90 and in the R-Design trim that I have, it costs more than $71K out-the-door, so to some shoppers the value isn't the most important aspect of the decision making process. Then let's take a look at the various tangible advantages that XC90 offers aside from pricing.  First and foremost, the interior of the XC90 is in a class of its own.  The upgraded contour seats are just amazing.  It truly provides the best comfort in any car money can buy. Next, the center console design is fantastic with the large touchscreen interface. The only thing that can compare to it is the even larger and better panel in the Tesla Model X.  Some reviewers on youtube still prefer the button and joystick controls in the Q7 or X5, but I think it is just the matter of accepting a change.  After using the XC90 touchscreen interface for about a week, I found it very intuitive and it responds very quickly.  I don't understand some of the comments which claim that using touchscreen during driving is more distracting. The fact is, no matter which systems you use, the driver still has to scroll through numerous menus either with a mouse pad (ie: Lexus) or a i-drive type joystick (ie: Audi/BMW), and they are all distracting. I found that the touchscreen on the XC90 at least offers huge icon for most features and all you need to do is to swipe left and right between two large menus.  To me, it really cannot get any simpler after one week of getting familiarizing of the system. By contrast, I found the concept of a retractable infotainment screen in the Q7 is very out of date. A retractable screen like that has been a thing in the past since the late-2000 Cadillac CTS.   The final point about XC90 interior is the fit and finish. Every single piece of the interior materials is top notch and the simplistic Scandinavian design is great.  However, the cabin is not the most quiet for a car in this price range. It is definitely not as tranquil as the cabin of a Mercedes.   Now, the second part of the review is about the OSD program. I did it when I placed the order with Volvo. With the OSD, there is no negotiation on prices, everything is ordered per the price list. The listed prices for the car and options are only slightly, if any, lower than MSRP.  The kicker is that OSD waives the destination charge, which saves $995 automatically.  In addition to that, Volvo provides 2 round trip tickets from any where in the USA to Gothenborg, Sweden and a night of hotel for you to travel to the factory and pick up your own car.  You may drive your own car through Europe up to 6 months and Volvo even covers the cost of your insurance up for 15 days.  And when you're done with the self-driving tour, you return the car to one of the designated locations and they will ship the car to your local dealership in the USA with no additional shipping charge.  So buying a car and getting a free trip to Sweden, why not?  I particular like this shopping experience because there is no haggling. I know what I am going to order and how much I'm going to pay exactly.  I get to tour the Volvo factory and drive my own car to see a part of Europe where I don't visit very often.  Such a great way to buy a car.

volvo,xc90,2018,Stuart B, 01/15/2018,Great Car - Confusing Tech,5,"Overall I love the 2018 XC 90. The design beautiful and the comfort is excellent. The performance is good our previous SUV's were the BMW X5 and the Explorer Sport. The one frustration for my wife and I is the Volvo Sensus Infotainment System. It's not bad but it's also far from good, as compared to BMW iDrive. The system would be much better if commonly used functions like climate control had their own physical buttons. The temperature and seat/steering wheel heat controls are slow to respond an lack haptic feedback. It's not possible to use these controls without taking your eyes off of the road.

volvo,xc90,2018,Sam, 12/02/2017,Our First Volvo and First Hybrid,4,"I am a new ones of the XC90 T8 for just over a week. We selected this car to be our family friendly car when we have visitors and when we go on a road trip. We replaced our Mercedes R530 with tis car. The R530 has a fantastic 3rd row seat that can fit adults (yes adults) in the 3rd row comfortably. So we wanted another SUV with third row that could eat adults. The Volvo XC90 came closest in this regard. The third row can seat adults not as comfortably as R530 but is not as tight as any other SUV with the 3rd row.  I have always owned BMW and Mercedes cars and I am very impressed with interior quality of this car. So I am not sure what the other reviewer is talking about a bad interior quality. We got the Denim Blue with Brown interior and we already got so many complement that how sharp everything looks. Also, regarding the instrument panel and center touch screen controls, I find it very intuitive for me and well organized. I do not have any issue with safety in using it because I have already configured all the settings and do not need to fiddle with them while driving. All the users complaining about the screen is because they try to fiddle with it while driving. So I attribute it to bad driver behavior.  So far, I love the car and it has meet all of my intial expectations.  I will try to update this review after few more months.

volvo,xc90,2018,Lynn, 01/16/2018,2016 & 2018 XC90 PLUG-IN HYBRID - PROBLEMS!!!,2,"This car looks luxurious outside and inside.  What is under the hood is another story.  It is riddled with repair issues.  I have already owned two of them because Volvo bought back my first one. My 2016 R-Design version had the check engine light on when I purchased it.  This recurred several more times and it took several more visits to the service shop to repair.  Then, my sun roof had a major leak, which I discovered after my free shower from the Costco car wash.  I had multiple issues with my temperature control systems and some repair on the fuel system, all requiring repairs.  Each repair, always took a minimum of 2 days (and those were rare). Most repairs took 5 business days, so I didn't have use of my car for well over 30 days. It only had 15,000 miles when they bought it back.  There were two issues they couldn't figure.  The seats would squeak when going over a small bump in the road (it sounded like nails on a chalkboard).  I had major issues pumping gas.  At certain gas stations, the pump would keep clicking off, so I couldn't tell how much gas was in the car.  One time, it wouldn't allow me to pump gas at all. It just kept clicking off.  I really liked the features of the car, so after Volvo bought back the 2016 I purchased two model years later, the 2018 XC90 T8 Inscription (also a plug-in hybrid).  I have owned it several months and at 3,400 miles my check engine light came on.  It has BEEN IN THE SHOP ONE WEEK SO FAR!  The thermostat needs replacing (please note the temperature control system issues on my 2016; shame on Volvo for not fixing this huge engine design flaw!).  The only trouble is the part is back-ordered!!!  The estimate for the part being available for purchase it another week and then about 8 days after that they should have it in the shop.  This REPAIR ESTIMATE ON MY BRAND NEW VEHICLE IS A MINIMUM OF 2 WEEKS, MORE LIKE 3 WEEKS IF I'M LUCKY.   As for the gas pumping issue...  It seems to have improved some with the newer XC90, but it IS STILL AN ISSUE VOLVO!  Furthermore, my seats are starting to squeak too! IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BETA TEST A LUXURY SUV AND PAY FULL PRICE, THEN THIS IS THE SUV FOR YOU.  If you have a life and don't have time to spend bringing your vehicle to the dealership, then I suggest buying from a different brand.

volvo,xc90,2018,Gilberto Riveron, 08/14/2018,Getting Right,5,"After a bad experience with Land Rover. Getting it right was a most. This is the car of the future,  with small refine engine that deliver the same performance that most of his rivals that use V6. Most of the reviews by the experts they pick on the engine, and I think they can’t see far from their nose. Volvo is getting ready for the real 21 century car. I love the safety features and the interior. Sure, they need to improve few things like voice command, and some applications like the AC should be easier to access without the need to touch the screen. The ride is on the stiff side but that is how I like, this is not bad or good, is just the way some people like, true can get bumpy in some particular roads, but guess what, the Audi Q7 does too (less but does). I recommend everyone that is searching for a midsize SUV to take look to the Volvo, do not pay much attention to the “experts reviews “. There are bias.

Cost $12,400 to repair and I find out from an engineer at another facility that its a design flaw in the XC90.  Don't know if this is accurate but I think to pay that much in replacement/repair on a vehicle with less than 70k miles that was maintained with oil changes etc speaks volumes for its lack of reliability.  Next my catalytic converter went out and I refused to pay over $1200 to repair it since my state (AR) doesn’t have emission laws so I live with the engine light on my dash being on all the time.  My break pad on drivers rear just “fell off” and the brake disc was ruined.  The auxiliary battery went out at 90,000 miles and cost $300 to replace.

volvo,xc90,2018,Shirley L, 05/29/2018,Worst Customer Service Experience in my life,1,"My new XC90 hit a parking pole when using the Park In feature.  I contacted Volvo USA and opened a case.  It's been 3 weeks, and still nothing has happened.  I have called and emailed numerous customer service reps and managers about the issue.  They are extremely difficult to get a hold of and do not respond in a timely manner.  Their attitude is also in NO WAY customer-centric.  All I keep hearing is that everyone is very busy, that there is only 1 Field Tech in the region who can inspect the vehicle and basically I just need to wait until they are free.  I talked to 2 managers about the issue, one was more responsive but also not easy to get a hold of, and the 2nd manager's attitude was that that how it is and nothing else can be done.  He took no accountability for the poor service provided so far either.

In short, if for any reason you have a warranty issue that needs to go through Volvo USA, be prepared to have a horrible customer service experience.  It has been so bad, I won't ever get a Volvo again, even though the car itself is quite nice.  Shockingly bad service for a luxury car brand.  Would give 0 stars if possible."

volvo,xc90,2018,Ryan Taylor, 01/08/2018,Unexpectedly Exceptional,5,"The luxury options on this vehicle place it among the top auto manufacturers. The interior design, and every element, has been so thoughtfully crafted around the driver, it is hard to believe that more people have not discovered Volvo. They really have stepped up to win with this one. The quality of materials would be on par with Bentley! I love the mix of leather, wood (with a matte finish), chrome dressings, all highlited with LED accents. Although the shiny black plastic area tend to collect fingerprints easily, which is why they supply a cleaning cloth (which you will use often). The seats are incredibly comfortable, with heat, cooling and a massage option that you will wonder how you ever lived without! Even the second row seats recline and are super comfy. The built-in child booster seat is convenient for when you have family or guests. The $3200 Bowers & Wilkins audio system is like being in a live concert, where, when you turn up the volume, you hear every detail in crisp clarity without it hurting your ears. If you love music, this could alone be reason enough to buy this SUV. I chose the hybrid option, which when you lease, you save the $5k California Rebate off the purchase price (as opposed to getting a tax credit when you purchase). I love that I can plug it in and get 15-18 miles of gas-free driving. It adds extra power that makes this 6600lb car move very fast. I also love that it drives completely silent on the Pure or hybrid mode. To me, this was worth the additional price. The instrument display is great and the main 9” Sensus central display is so easy to use and again, really thought through. It is so sensible and user friendly, I am very impressed. Apple CarPlay works great, as does the Bluetooth option. The XM radio is amazing and it has a Spotify app that uses the AT&T modem, if you sign up for data service. I’m using the trial and have had a few issues with it buffering, as there is no option to download a playlist, like you can on a phone. I think that I will probably just use my iPhone with Spotify instead of paying for another device ($10/20 per mo). One last note, the safety features are the best available. I love the auto steering that helps you stay in your lane during normal everyday driving. It watches the road lines and applies corrective steering automatically if you start to drift. The heads up display is great too. It gives you a warning if you are driving too close, or if it senses a forward collision (which It sometimes falsely does on curvy roads). It displays the current speed limit and warns you if you drive faster (you can adjust the warning speed too). These features help you to be a better driver. Overall I’m so impressed and happy with my purchase. I sold my Porsche 911s to buy this vehicle and I would never go back! I also, love that there are not tons of these cars on the road and when friends hear I bought a Volvo, they don’t have any idea how amazing it is. Everyone already knows that Volvos are the safest cars in the world, they just don’t expect them to be this exceptional.

Almost all the call functionality is centered around the Sensus console which simply fails!  There is a always a lag when starting the car before the console responds.  The touch screen is so so and it messes up the driver profiles all the time.

Also the rear passenger side door lock is not working after 3 months.  Very disappointed in Volvo.

volvo,xc90,2018,Wendy, 09/12/2019,BEWARE OF Manufacturer warranty,2,"Loved my 2018 Volvo until we had to take it in for an oil leak.  They discovered oil sludge and said it was due to lack of maintenance.  It only has 30,000 miles and the oil has been changed twice (per Volvo's every 10,000 miles standard).  It was just now due for the third oil change.  The problem is that our oil wasn't changed at Volvo, but at a local oil change shop in our hometown.  The shop that changed my oil used 100 percent synthetic oil, which is what Volvo calls for.  We live 1.5 hours away from the nearest Volvo, which is why we used someone local.  No one ever told us we were required to use Volvo, and that if we went outside Volvo, to be sure and keep our receipts.  So the manufacturer is now denying our warranty and we are out $2,900.00  After the shock of Volvo not utilizing our warranty, I began reading the manual.  The manual states it ""recommends"" to use Volvo for servicing, but it does not say it REQUIRES.  The manual also states that the warranty can't be denied if you can't provide receipts of maintenance.  However, they are still denying our warranty because we can't produce receipts.  They continue to say its lack of maintenance.  However, we were able to provide bank statements showing the oil changes along with maintenance that was performed on my car at an actual Volvo dealership 6 months after purchasing the vehicle.  After 7 days and two Volvo dealerships going to bat for me, the manufacturer still refused to honor my warranty.  It's absolutely crazy that the manufacturer wouldn't work with me OR the two Volvo dealerships who were trying to help me (one dealership in Dallas and another dealership in Shreveport).  Due to the lack of trust with Volvo, we are now paying my lease off early and trading my vehicle in on another car (not a Volvo).  We are doing this because any problem we have in the future, the manufacturer will more than likely not honor our warranty and blame any future problems on the oil sludge issue.  It's a shame, but it seems like the manufacturer finds any loophole they can to not utilize your warranty and make you pay out of pocket for repairs. CONSUMER BEWARE "
volvo,xc90,2018,Kim Cicero, 06/18/2019,The tires on the XC90 are terrible,3,"I bought a 2019 xc90 T5.  The tires are worn down after 14,000 miles.  All four tires need to be replaced.  The cost for four new tires from the local Volvo dealer is $1,400.  I would have never bought this car, if I knew that the tires wear out this quickly.

volvo,xc90,2018,John Braswell, 03/13/2018,Voluptuous Volvo,5,"With rebates and discounts, we got about 10% off MSRP. We got a Costco discount of 6% off MSRP which is basically invoice price then added rebates. Shop around and then shop around some more. Working with internet sales at the dealership instead of showing up was where we got the best price. Our local Darrell Waltrip Volvo had the best sales rep but absolutely worst pricing and their manager was extremely difficult to deal with on two separate occasions. I will avoid ever buying a car there. But the car technology is off the charts and it’s elegant without being overly busy like some other cars. The ride is as smooth as a bottle of Col. E.H Taylor single barrel bourbon with the sophistication of a Johnnie Walker Blue Label. Our 7 yr old loves the built in child seat, and our 14 yr old loves the Bluetooth and Apple car play. I drove it home from Louisville and rarely touched the brake or gas for about 100 miles while using the adaptive cruise control and semi autonomous auto pilot. It’s sexy yet extremely safe. We love our new Volvo XC90 T6. Don’t drink and drive.

volvo,xc90,2018,latta, 06/03/2018,VOLVO USA MIA IN Customer Service,2,"The shifter knob came off. It was glued to a piece of metal. The sound system speakers rattle. The dealers do not honor the warranty. I sent emails to corporate in NJ. No one answers back. I am a disabled Veteran who needs a stable suspension. My xc90 hybrid has air suspension. I do not think it works half the time. The transmission slips. When I cut the auto off the motor fan makes a loud sound as if I was pushing on the gas in neutral. I hate I had to spend so much money through military sales to buy the auto. A lot of the components are plastic. The dealer replaced a plastic vent cover. Looks like something you get from Walmart. NOT WORTH THE BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEALER REFUSING TO HONOR THE WARRANTY.  AND THIS IS HOW VOLVO TREATS VETERANS!!!

volvo,xc90,2018,Matt B, 01/26/2019,"Unbeatable design and style, glitchy tech",4,"We bought a loaded Inscription to replace our Sienna minivan. It checked all the boxes for a relatively kid- and mom-friendly SUV: easy ingress and egress, access to a reasonably large third row, ample storage, and excellent safety ratings. It's an easy driving, large SUV on a car wheel base, so it feels nimble and maneuverable, while at the same time offering the solid build you'd expect from a Volvo. We enjoy the true-SUV riding height and visibility of this vehicle, without the lumbering and bulky feel of some full-size, truck-based-chasis SUVs. However, the main distinguishing factor of this car is the unmatched style and interior quality and fit-and-finish. The open-pore, natural wood details in the cockpit are gorgeous, along with the stitched leather clad dash, buttery soft leather seats, and elegant and efficient control layout. I'm 6'5"", and find the cockpit to be roomy and comfortable with great legroom. The upgraded Bowers & Wilkins sound system is truly amazing and an audiophile's dream. The 4-cylinder engine is both super-and turbo-charged and makes the X90 a top performer in its class. I don't believe a more luxurious and high performance full-sized SUV is available for under $100k. We looked. However, this car disappoints in a few areas. Most of the typical analog entertainment and climate controls have been consolidated into the Sensus touch-screen interface, which is essentially like having a vertical iPad in the center of the console to control nearly all functions. Although there's a learning curve for the complex menus and deep settings options, it wouldn't be an issue if the processor wasn't so incredibly laggy. Especially on start-up, the touch screen is nearly non-responsive, taking up to 15 seconds(!) to register and respond to touches. The rear-view camera is slow to engage and disengage, and you're often stuck sitting and waiting for the Sensus processor to catch up to your commands. It is actually a big distraction, and makes it feel like it's a car you can't just hop into and go. Here's my list of other gripes with this car, some pretty minor: 4-cyl engine performs well, but sounds like a whiny 4; The two main performance settings are 'comfort' and 'dynamic' - while the air suspension is nice and cushy on the comfort setting the engine is a bit too slow and subdued. The dynamic setting provides a nice firm ride but the car is almost too jumpy and eager to downshift. If you test drive the car, pay attention to the various performance settings and see if they suit you. The Bluetooth connectivity is slow and cumbersome. It's a pain to connect media on your phone to the car. However, all said most of these are minor gripes. We've taken the car on several long road trips in all types of weather, including heavy rain and snow, and it's performed perfectly. If Volvo fixes the Sensus interface (more memory, better processor... whatever) I'd buy the car again without reservation.

volvo,xc90,2018,William Mathers, 06/21/2018,The future of cars,5,"This is a fantastic SUV. Mileage around town hovers around 78 MPG with electric gas combined. On long freeway trips this drops to 35. Incredible for a vehicle of this size. The electric only range is about 18 miles. I would like to see this increased in future models. The interior is very comfortable and the exterior is gorgeous. 
I had one significant reliability problem with the car battery draining after two weeks of no use. Eventually the dealer found the current leak which fixed the problem. 
I really like the safety features such as the lane control and the automatic break activation system.
This car is expensive but worth it."
volvo,xc90,2018,Amar, 06/19/2019,Volvo experience sucks.,2,"Poor reliability, have had some issue or the other with my xc90 and dealership experience is absolutely horrendous. Almost every time there is no loaner vehicle, probably explained if so many volvos are having issues that they are out of loaners all the time. Every year the car has been in the shop for some reason or the other. I will never ever buy a volvo again. Would stick to other luxury brands that are either reliable or have a great customer service. Both of these are missing from volvo."
volvo,xc90,2018,ebakes, 05/22/2018,"Decent handling, but wish I bought a cheaperhybrid",3,"I bought the 2018 xc90 T5 AWD with comfort and convenience packages. I previously owned an Infiniti Qx80.  Comparatively, I miss the luxury, space and comfort of the Qx80 and traded in for this car because my Infiniti was coming out of warranty and I wanted something with tighter handling, smaller and much better mpg.  Well, I'm very surprised that my xc90 T5 is averaging only 17 mpg.  My enormous Infiniti got a dismal 14mpg, but for 3 mpg's I'd take the Infiniti back.  Not sure why the mileage is so bad- I even drive in economy mode often, and the car's motor shuts off every time I come to a stop light.  Regarding the handling, it's definitely tighter and 'zippier' so at least I achieved that.  But I could've achieved that with any number of less expensive vehicles. The cabin feels tight, espeicially the front seats and I can't seem to find a seat position that is comfortable. Maybe I'm too tall? I'm 5'10"".  Idk, but definitely having a bit of buyers remorse...

volvo,xc90,2018,Roberto, 11/28/2018,Hands down great car,5,"I went shopping for a full size luxury SUV, and was choosing between the new Land Rover Discovery, Range Rover Sport, Audi Q7 and the Volvo XC90. Im glad I chose the Volvo. It had the best price for all that the car offers, and the car is absolutely amazing. It has a luxurious interior, beautiful front panel layout, the tech is awesome. The car drives itself. Recommend 100%.

volvo,xc90,2018,Eric M, 10/28/2017,Beautiful but very poor exterior quality & electro,3,"I put a standard Saris trunk mount bike rack on the car that I have used on 4 other vehicles to take the kids's bikes down to the beach. On the way, the bike rack fell and I pulled over to find that the body panel had RIPPED! (Yes, ripped). Turns out it is plastic - not metal. I looked at the manual to see if it tells you that you cannot use a trunk mount bike rack. Not only does it not say that you can't use a bike rack, it actually warns you that a trunk mount bike rack may interfere with the rear view back-up camera. Volvo has flatly refused to do anything about the damage and the dealer has given me the name of a bodyshop who apparently does a lot of work on Volvos.  I have also noticed that the quality of the paint or gelcoat is very poor. The electronics are constantly malfunctioning. They replaced my entire ""module"" (electronic dash panel?) within 5000 miles. I had to take it back again for more malfunctioning electronics. My friend has the same car and the same electronics problems. The rear seats stick and sometimes the kids cant move it to access the third row.
"
volvo,xc90,2018,Doc, 11/13/2017,Only useful as a city vehicle,3,"I test drove this vehicle. Wonderful interior, nice exterior styling. The electronics and safety are impressive. But... whoever designed and engineered the drive train was misguided. The 14 mile all-electric range is a joke. 8 miles at best. The gasoline powered range is laughable. 13 gallons fuel capacity. The T8 is really a front wheel drive vehicle with an electric rear wheel drive assist. I cannot imagine what the range would be if you were towing a boat or had something mounted on the roof. It is probably well suited for someone who lives in the city, drives the kids to school and goes to the market. With the short electric range, you will find the gas engine is virtually always needed and thus you are just hauling around an extra 500 lbs. of spent batteries. But with a full charge, this vehicle is fast from a standstill. Only two negatives about the rest of the car: The front armrests are too short for tall drivers and the ride with the optional wheels and tires is a bit rough, even with the air suspension. Positives are many, but this is a very expensive vehicle once you start adding options. Many dealers are selling them at or below invoice. The extra $5002 in tax credit would be appreciated, but the T6 is a much better value. BTW. I am probably getting another X5 diesel.

volvo,xc90,2018,Mike Arnold, 06/17/2019,Pay money to be a test dummy leasing for 2 years,2,"Leased the XC 90 because it was a beautiful suv, and came with a lot of guarantees of technology, good gas mileage, autonomis driving. First, it is nice to drive when it works, but honestly it feels like Volvo just threw this out here and didn’t really test it. It’s been in the shop every 3 months for electrical problems, or driving issues, I go through breaks and tires like I own a Lamborghini, and I don’t drive it that much. Not to mention the manufacturer promised me an extra warranty when I purchased due to my former ownership with VW but that’s my personal beef and nothing to do with the actual car.   Gas mileage is horrible, accelerating is weak, something is popping up as a malfunction every month, I wouldn’t take the risk unless you want to pay to be a test dummy for Volvo.

volvo,xc90,2018,dblassc, 01/12/2018,Not worth it!!!!,2,"I’m leasing this new car $620 a month 39 lease term, momentum plus package, 12k miles. To be honest after have other great brands, this is by far the worst SUV I ever had, all the technology involved (for which I purchased) is really hard to take advance of it, I mean the safety features might be great but inside the car the way they felt is another history.
 
Control Panel: Zero intuitive, very difficult to use them. With 2nd largest display in the market (after Tesla)  you really really expect to work just fine.  I consider my self a tech person and I use all the features and they are definitely not friendly, you can only use one at the time, cant mix audio with air condition for example, because there is all integrated.

Voice navigation:  is by far the worst on the market, better not to have at all, 5 or 5 times is unresponsive and failed, after 2 system upgrades directly from Volvo is definitely something with the way it was designed, the only way I found to make it work is to send the address directly from the Volvo on-call app to the car directly, which never let you ask for an address directly.  FYI (I updated maps from Florida in full).

Seating: Front row seating are another failure by far the hard as a rock,  and impossible to set up, basic lumbar features for a 55K SUV.

Climate: Very poor in terms of vent power, and again difficult to get to the controls directly.  (Included in screen panel only)

Volvo on call: This system allowed you to start your car from the phone, service is included in the 39 lease term, but you can only use 2 times per day (???)

Gas Consumption: 
In terms of engine seems to be powerful (mine a 2.0 turbo, 4 cylinders) but consumption is very high for a small engine like that , in my case city commuter , less than 18 per gallon.

Service on Dealer:  Service people very diligent and pro costumer service, I can not say the same from General Sales Manager, Carlos Sacasas (Volvo Carsf North Miami), that will treat you in the worst way, like you are not worth it as a client for them STAY AWAY!!

I already have it for 200 miles enough to know that this car won’t last in my hands for the full lease term (already searching for options to change)

volvo,xc90,2018,Robert swedberg, 02/02/2019,Disappointed,3,"I have purchased probably 40 new cars in my lifetime. I can honestly say that this is the first time I have been really disappointed in a new vehicle after only a few weeks of ownership. Many of the things I don’t like could have been made more owner friendly with little or no  extra effort. The car is difficult to get in and out of. With the power seat and steering wheel, it would seem that the easy entry function present in most other cars in this class would have been included. It would also seem that things like cruise control ,lane guidance  and driving mode  could be included in memory functions for each driver rather than having to reselect them each time you enter if you don’t like the preselected settings..At service, the dealer says that Volvo recommends tire rotation, but doesn’t cover the $30 charge. I have talked with the dealer, and the Volvo phone line, but there doesn’t appear to be a solution other than look for a new vehicle. We were naive perhaps, because we had owned an earlier XC 90 and been very happy with it.

Twice I had to go to repair water leak around the doors. Acceleration is very poor and seams to me very 'lazy' car. Comfort is not so great as I am getting a back pain when driving longer then 2 hrs. I am also driving Ford and don't have this problem. Resale value 50% down after three years and very low mileage. And the worst thing ever is the app. I paid $500 for it. This is not worth it!!! The app controlling your car! You can't start car for more then twice in a row. Maps can't be used when the car is in use, which means if you are driving and have somebody else in the car wants to use this app, they can't. You stop the car to add the address to be sent to your car, and it takes minimum of 15 minutes for app to recognize the car is not in use. This app is a joke.

volvo,xc90,2018,Jodi J, 08/05/2018,Horrible lock system,2,"This vehicle has a ridiculously complicated lock system....It requires 31 pages of instruction in the owner's manual!   The app includes a function that allows you to unlock the car doors remotely.  The problem is that when you get to the car you are required to open the tailgate before the doors will unlock.  This is a huge hassle if I want to send my kids out to get in the car or am carrying an armload of stuff to toss in the backseat.  Unlocking the doors using the fob isn't much better as the doors will re-lock within 2 minutes if not opened promptly.  This morning I wanted to grab my sunglasses out the car before my walk but I missed the magic 2 minute window.  So I had to go back up to my place to unlock the car again.  When I unlock my car I expect the the car to be unlocked.  I don't need Volvo to worry about my security or second guess my choices for me.   A lot is expected from a vehicle at this price point.  What I did not expect is daily frustration over door locks.   Thankfully I leased and didn't purchase.

Started looking for new car but I didn’t want to get the same MDX, they are planning to bring back a new one by 2020. So, started my research, I drove the Q7, Atlas, X5, RX, MKT. They are all good cars, all depends what are you looking for. I saw a Land Rover Velar and I fall in love, the futuristic layout interior and exterior was the breaking point, I WAS WRONG, after 3 weeks with the Velar, spent 2 with a Loner. Definitely something was wrong about the car. So I took a hard decision, need a new car now, I will loose money but is better than drive a car that you are not safe. I went back to my list and looked into the volvo xc90, there were mixed reviews but decided to get a test drive, the dealer was very nice and let me drive the car for a day, by the end of that day I had made my mind. I had now my volvo for 2 month, loved. There is not other brand that give you so many safety features for the money, and they actually work very well. The interior is one of the best in his class, sitting very confortable even for the third. Exterior is styling and unique, the ride is good, could be bumpy in some roads, but no far from his other competitor. I got the top trim. Love it.

I was looking for a vehicle to down size from the 2004 Yukon Denali I have. I was really looking for a 6 cylinder to give me the power and also reduce the fuel cost.  Though I wasn't sold on the 4 cylinder at first I gave the XC90 a chance. After reading the reviews on the the vehicle I was skeptical  about the power, but after test driving on the highway in all the driving modes I didn't find any problem with the acceleration or power.The only comment I would have is that it doesn't roar like a high powered machine but it moves when asked to. If your looking for a race car don't by it. If your looking for one of the best SUV's in it's class go try one out. I've only had a week so I can't answer all of the questions in the survey but for me it beat out the Acura, Mercedes, Audi, and Infinity. Though each of them may have had a feature I really liked I picked the XC90 for the overall package.

Sometimes I retreat to my car just to sit there... the seats are that good.  I have a bad back, and they're therapeutic.  The Bowers and Wilkins sound system is stunningly excellent.  For a large-ish SUV, it handles well.  I'm getting better than the EPA-predicted gas mileage (mostly running it on the ""eco"" setting).  I get a lot of compliments from guests on the look of the exterior and interior.  People who complain that the tablet-like center stack is not intuitive haven't tried very hard... I find it just fine.  (One niggle:  I don't like having to always turn off the default automatic ignition off/on feature).  The pilot assist is almost magic... makes long trips a breeze.

volvo,xc90,2019,Ryan, 12/16/2019,Sadly disappointed...,1,"I bought a fully loaded XC90 T8 after seeing it at the auto show, primarily because of the 7 seats (for taking everyone in one car), the safety features, and the luxurious interior. I leased the car for 3 years with the intention of buying it after, but sadly after 24 months, I'm paying $5000 to CarMax to get out of my lease and have them take if off my hands. It's a bitter divorce because I do love all the reasons why I bought it. The Auto Pilot is awesome and I love the touch screen and especially love the Bowers & Wilkins audio. But the problems started soon after delivery with multiple service and Volvo On-Call lights coming on that required multiple service apts. Also, in the first year the air suspension went out and needed to be replaced. The second year, the rear transmission broke. It keep jolting the rear of the car like I ran over a huge pothole, but then I would look and there wasn't one. I didn't know what it was until several times that I tried to pull out into traffic and it lost power on me. I had to step on the gas hard to get the car to move. Then it leaked transmission fluid all over the garage. Volvo repaired it, and then it had to go back in 2 more times because they couldn't get the gasket fit correctly to stop the leaking. Upon the last time at Bob Smith Volvo in Calabasas, CA, the service department returned my car with a huge dent in the rear passenger door.  Of course they took responsibility, but it took over 2 weeks for them to repair it.  Volvo is good about giving you a current model Volvo as a courtesy car, and I've been able to drive every one of their different models. After driving the XC40 for several weeks (of course while paying a lease on a $90K car), I realized how bad the brakes are in the XC90 T8, they do require quite a bit of brake petal force in comparison to all the other cars. In the past 2 months, my XC90 has been in the service dept for 28 days! I can't take it anymore. I didn't want to believe Consumer Reports when they rated Volvo as terrible in Reliability, but they are not so wrong. I have never had more problems with any other vehicle I have ever owned. And It's not like I bought a cheap Volvo, in fact, just the opposite, I bought their best one, fully loaded. And now I understand why more people are not buying these cars. It's really sad and disappointing. I spent over $41K to drive this car for 24 months and now I can say for sure it was the worst car I have ever bought.

volvo,xc90,2019,Scott Stephens, 03/08/2019,So Close to Perfect Yet Miles Away.,4,"Updated: 9-11-19. 

Edmunds sent me an email asking me to update my review now that I’ve owned the car for awhile.  I am happy to update it, but I wish I had a more positive update to offer.   I am now at 40,000 miles and beyond my 3 free maintenance services, which came with the car when I bought it.  Volvo is telling me that is a $750 service - ouch!   The car has taken on additional little rattles from when I first bought it.  It’s not terrible, but is noticeable.  Overall, I don’t have the same level of optimism that this car will last as long as the 2009 Lexus GX 460 I bought new and kept until 2017.   I’m not unhappy that I bought this car, but I also don’t think I’d buy it again.  The instrumentation cluster alone is enough to cause me to have an accident from it not working the way I expect it to while driving.  Overall, while the ride is just ok, the user controlled technology has a lot of room for improvement. 

This car has everything going for it for a guy who loves the ride and feel of an SUV - a smart bold, masculine look; a super comfortable and well-appointed interior; and decent gas mileage.  It even has some pep to it even though it’s a 4-cylinder...AND it’s not outrageously expensive.  So why then isn’t this the best selling SUV on the road?   I’ll tell you why.   It’s that damn infotainment system.   The computer that runs it, as well as pretty much every other aspect of the car, is extremely difficult to use and is incredibly slow to respond.  In today’s age of technology advancements computer flash memory makes consumer’s expectation on responsiveness to be instantaneous.  In this car it’s so slow that I’ve almost gotten into car accidents trying to monkey around getting things to work.   Whether it’s my iPhone integration, which is so darn confusing when you turn off the car, or whether it’s just trying to get the right radio station to work correctly in conjunction with the sound, this car becomes a major headache.    Again, the car itself is not a bad car, but the inner workings are so hard to deal with my frustration has boiled over a number of times.  Knowing what I know now I would have bought another Lexus and I know those cars aren’t perfect either.

volvo,xc90,2019,Stacy, 08/05/2019,Trying to <3 my Volvo XC90 but it is not reliable,3,"I took one look at the XC90 and sent my husband a text with a heart emoji. By the end of the week, my husband picked out the perfect car with the bells and whistles. I got the T5 though because I'm not driving fast in carpool waiting for my kids to get out of school, so why spend the extra $10,000. Anyways, I bought it in February 2019 and it has had several issues. The small activity key failed and died after a month of use. We were left stranded in a parking lot until some friends were able to break into our house to find the regular keys and bring them to us. The sunroof would not close due to a computer sensor malfunction. They could not fix my until the following week, so I had to drive around with a hole in my car. The car completely turned off while moving through an intersection. After restarting, we were able to continue. The fuel injector broke, but at least they gave me a courtesy car. Most recently the auxiliary battery died and had to be released. Reliability is not this car's strength.

volvo,xc90,2019,Run_Forest_Run, 05/08/2019,Really great SUV,5,"This is my second XC-90. I had a 2017 T6 Momentum and just swapped it out on lease for the 2019 T6 Inscription. The new one has the air suspension. Absolutely you want that option! Way better than the standard suspension. The vehicle, despite the 4 cylinder, has plenty of power, a little turbo lag, but not much. Put it in ""dynamic"" mode and it really goes. Don't waste your money on the $3,200 Bowers and Wilkins sound system, the Harmon Kardon system that comes standard on the Inscription is really awesome as is. Two things that you should be aware of: A. the Heads up Display disappears with sunglasses on unless you have gray aviator lenses. B. The IPad like infotainment system looks really nice and works well. But, it is a distraction in traffic when you need to change something. You have to physically touch it or swipe to change something, which requires you to take your eyes off the road. I would prefer if they added a knob to make the changes like Audi or BMW has. If you can afford it I would opt for the Inscription package. Nicer seats with massage and A/C, nicer trim, wheels etc. Better sound system, etc.

volvo,xc90,2019,David, 06/02/2019,"XC90 - luxury, quiet, relax, powerful",5,"2019 T6 Inscription - Been a Volvo owner for many years.  Traded in my wife Mercedes E350 for the T6.  Some say the engine is not powerful - it is powerful - yeah its a 4 cylinder and sounds like it but it works well.  If you want a better sounding engine look elsewhere but that is not the reason for buying the car.  Yes the infortainment system or lets say the Volvo's iPad contains many (most) functions and there is a learning curve but a short one.  Once one understands it - it is a breeze to use but if you are one that has trouble with your smart phone then this is not for you.  Bottom line the ""iPad"" works great and it is easy to use.  It is QUIET - thankfully it has all the safety bells and whistles because I might fall to sleep as it is so quiet especially with the seat massager on.  It is luxurious with its Nappa leather Volvo seats - these seats are the best.  I have had many Volvos and every seat was great. I prefer ""Zippy sporty"" cars however I really appreciate the relax peaceful yet accurate driving XC90.  Get the Air Suspension it just smooths out the ride otherwise the ride is very European which I find very nice also but others may find to ""sharp"" on our american roads.  It has great visibility and all the tech that one will need and more.  It is worth putting this on your list to test drive.

volvo,xc90,2019,New Volvo Fan, 06/25/2019,Our first Volvo SUV,5,"We just love our XC90 T6 R-Design (we've had it for two months now, and my wife and I usually have to fight over who is going to drive it). The vehicle rides extremely well, and the engine (with Polestar) produces excellent power and torque. We test drove a model without Polestar, and both the power and torque are very good. We are still learning all the technology, but if you are using it every day, you'll learn fairly fast. Reading the owner's manual is recommended as certain features are not most intuitive (read carefully the section on automatic car wash, if you plan on using it). Our vehicle came with Bowers & Wilkins premium sound system (worth every penny, although it is pricey) and four-corner air suspension (we love this). I just wished the vehicle came with a CD drive (we are still a bit old school, but learned that one can actually buy a Volvo CD player as an accessory).

volvo,xc90,2019,Jim F, 08/01/2019,Reliabilty: trouble ahead,3,"The chineese own Volvo but the swedish folks still build them. Just last year the first volvo parts disributuon center in America opened. 

I drove the car hard as an uber driver. Loved the looks and handling when i bought it new in 2016. 

All services that rate cars have this Volvo near the bottom in reliability. Do not mistake great safety record over the years with reliability. Checking around with owners of Volvo brand, i got a mixed bag of reliabilty issues. But man the garage is always full doing reoairs in two Chicago Volvo locations. I know as i was there often.

Volvos have a histiry of being leakers. The sun roof - the pilars specicly. Although i also had drios abivevthe visir. Know that if you put off fixing it thn you could run out of time fir fuxing it on the warranty. You csn get a puddle in the back right corner of vehiclr. Under the bumper is the modular which meaures the oil. Which is done through instrument panrl in car - no popping the hood. The modular gets the rain water ftom roof pillars and it fries out.

I had problems with a transmussion line. First probkem with this Volvo in Noryh Ameruca so they were on phone to sweden. Also problems with fuel filter - twice. The has release pressure mechanism on side of car had to be replaced once too. Parts came over on a slow boat from sweden as the first parts facilty in America was yet to open.

The rough ride over bumps is truthful reporting. I had problems with ruders breaking or jamming the spring in the track to move the second row of seats - this is not on Volvo though.

The traction control switch to sport control is awesome. Realky ferl the difference..i liked the aacceleratiin. 

Overal i loved the looks but became disenchanted with the car breaking down often and the dealership having to wait on parts. This is a caveat emptor - buyer beware.

I got XC-90-T6 Lease at zero, the car stops every time I change the speed for traffic signals, and I have to restart the car again, cars peeping behind me or they just you know... I had the same model for the last three years leasing, I am well familiar with the car. The front and side sensors are not working, engine alarm signal, etc.
I called the Volvo agent, they kept my zero cars for repairs. The Volvo agent refused to give me another new car or just cancel my lease.  They rent a fan for my use till they repair the car which should be on zero.
Anyhow, for your safety, do not buy this Volvo XC-90. IT IS THE WORST!
My XC-90-T6 2019 with zero miles has malfunctioning Transitions and non-working sensors.  I had the same model for the last three years was good, but my recent lease from Manhattan Volvo was terrible. On my way home the car stopped while I am at the driving mode on most of the traffic lights, terrible feeling that scares me seeing the cars drive towards you and your new Volvo is not running. Volvo is no longer safe, what is more, important than your safety? Volvo even calls back a half-million cars they produced and are not safe https://www.euronews.com/2019/07/20/volvo-issues-recall-notice. My advice do not waste your money and buy Volvo for your safety.  Manhattan Volvo dealer refused to terminate my few hours leasing or replace the malfunctioning cars.  I am paying the lease and I do not have a car it is in Volvo Manhattan workshop, I do not recommend both of Volvo Manhattan or buying a Volvo car.

volvo,xc90,2019,Ollie C, 09/02/2020,Great car very occasionally glitchy,4,"I’ve had my Volvo XC90 T8 for 3 years now and it’s been great, over 2.5 years the main gripes were very minor indeed such as software updates and more flat tyres than my previous X5 which had run flats. Eventually I found alternate cheaper tyres with an excellent rating half the price of the Scorpions. The main gripe I have is with Park Assist, it’s incredibly touch and go and the most annoying thing about it compared to the far better version that BMW system 7 has is the fact it can’t factor in the curb location. So on my 2016 volvo you have to control the braking and speed and where you stop to allow for the curb, so volvos park assist on does the steering and therefore 50% of the job. The first time I used it I didn’t know about the fact it couldn’t detect the curb and I scuffed the brand new alloys, which I thought was the whole point of it! So it’s a waste of money in the Volvo but worth it in the BMW system 7 version. The other gripe I have relating to the wheels and parking is the diamond alloys; the tyre wall is not proud enough from the alloy so they scuff far too easily and being diamond cost you a fortune to repair. I would have much rather had steel alloys that were cheaper to repair or alloys that allowed the tyre to be proud by say and inch so you could at least reverse into a curb without scuffing. At 2.5 years I’m so 3.5 years actual on the car it’s done nearly 25k miles and it’s developed some EV fault which it’s in for now. Putting my foot on the accelerator pedal in Pure or Hybrid mode The car just loses power and it’s dangerous pulling away out of junctions for instance so I have had to drive it in Power mode only to avoid it. There were no warning lights and apparently it’s due to the pre-charge system. We’ll see what this ends up costing me! Overall it’s a great car though and I think the infotainment and controls are pretty good actually and simpler than BMW’s system 7 although far less exciting. It’s more obvious how to plugin in your phone and use say Car play. The ride in mine which has the air suspension is really comfortable and the seats are nice. The rear ISO fixes are in the right place so when getting my 3 year old twins in and out I’m not bending in much to get them in their seats, compared to say the 2020 X5 where the isofix bars and seats are further in From the door so you’re bending in which is far less comfortable getting your kids in their seats. The transmission on the car is pretty unresponsive compared to say a n X5, the paddle shifts whilst changing gear have quite a latency and the engine breaking is pretty non existent so the paddles and manual driving option serves no purpose on the Volvo, whereas on the X5 you can do fun hill descents and really get the benefit of semi manual and paddle shifting. In the Volvo you don’t! It’s not a drivers car like the Beamer, it’s just a great family car with no driving excitement bar the odd booting it at lights in Power mode, but that’s as far as the fun goes. The Bowes and Wilkins stereo upgrade I have is epic and I love the sound as a musician. The automatic LED lights are fantastic as well. The windscreen washers aren’t great as there’s not enough juice and power of water hitting the windscreen and mine doesn’t seem to have rain sensor which I had on my previous X5 and loved along with soft close doors which wasn’t an option on the Volvo, I believe. The 2016 door bins are too small for drinks bottles but the centre cup holders are good, ideally would hold various sizes though. The 3rd row seats were far better than the Q7 or X5 and can more easily accommodate adults. I wish they had put isofix in the front passenger seat and even the centre second row seat so you could still get people into the 3rd row, as you can’t without them either climbing in through the boot or trying get around the child seats which is bad news and not possible for
 teenagers or adults. Plus my wife has to climb regularly through to the back from the front to sit between the twins in the second row and then struggles to get out! Overall verdict, if you have a big family and a large dog, get one. If you don’t and want an exciting large SUV to drive, don’t and get an X5.

volvo,c30,2008,wadlust, 04/29/2015,Roadster with practical side,5,"I bought C30 seven years ago used with 20K. The handsome external design expresses my style well. It is practical (overall small size, with easy back seat conversion to increased cargo volume), well balance (power and mileage), and simple inside. I used it to transport tools and materials for home improvement, to take my dog to the park, to go skiing (roof ski rack), and to go on hikes from trail heads far into the Washington state Cascade mountain roads. This car does all of this at good mileage, reliable services, and sporty feel. At 110K sold it at good re-sale price. I have had door auto lock relays replaced on warranty (it was locking door without command to do so). Windshield was replaced at 60K. Consistent and annoying problem with this car is water leaks from sun roof water drain hose putting out of frame connector. At 110K engine cam shaft seal start to leak slowly. This is not a big deal, since it is time for timing belt work and so labor cost it not that big since you are already in that area (belt replacement). Otherwise great car!

I also considered, Audi A3 and the Volkswagen Golf. This car had better feeling materials inside then the VW. It handles very well. Suspension is in my opinion a perfect balance between harshness and handling. It's also pretty quick when you need that extra push and not too bad on gas if you're taking it easy."

Excellent commuter vehicle with enough zip to manuvre in heavy (Chicago) traffic with confidence.
Very comfortable long range cruiser (I take at least eight 8+ hour trips each year) even with three in the car.
Plenty of leg room in back for 6 footers even on long trips, though taller passengers might end up feeling cramped after a few hours.

If you hear a hum that progressively gets louder as the engine warms up, NOT a belt squeal.
STOP the car and IMMEDIATELY shut the engine off.
Have the car towed to your mechanic or dealership.

It's a shame that the fuel efficiency isn't as good as what one might hope, but it is still acceptable considering the performance and overall package.

I'm still impressed with its performance, handling, and overall feel. More than a few times I've needed the quick acceleration and my C30 has delivered without fail. Almost all my miles are city and zip around with a fairly heavy foot so I've been getting around 20 mpg. I'm sure I could get better if I were more conservative but thats not my style. If I had it to do over again would I buy the Volvo C30? Yes indeed."
volvo,c30,2008,Good Job Volvo, 12/04/2008,Well built speed machine!,4,"I have owned this car for 8000 miles now. I wanted to get in some seat time and see how the car would responed to my new born daughter and her car seat before I write a review. Volvo has indeed out done itself. From the ordering process to the driving experience(minus the build time). I was hooked the second I jumped in and cranked the key. My wife and I were worried about our daughters car seat. We have a Graco rear facing seat with the quick release base. I have only two complaints about this. One, is that you have to move the seat forward in order for it to fit. Luckily for my wife she is small. The second is locking of the seat after I put the car seat in or out of the car"
volvo,c30,2008,JohnRae, 04/09/2009,I love my 1st Volvo,5,"I've had my car a little bit over a year now and still love it. Very fun to drive and has the power to overtake other cars if ever needed. The suspension is a bit stiff but handles very well. The styling is one of the main reasons I bought the car. Its unique, sporty, and classy all in one. A real eye catcher. Its nice to have a car that you don't see at every other stop light. My small list of gripes for this car is: 1. The passenger side seatbelt rattles a bit when driving. 2. At times would like to have more trunk room. But i just fold my rear seats down normally if i need more space. 3. Would be nice to have the trip computer come standard instead of having to pay extra for it."
volvo,c30,2008,Kate, 04/24/2009,DEFINATELY a great buy,4,"I traded in my 2005 Toyota Scion TC and said I would NEVER get anything but a toyota ever. WELL, I saw the C30, test drove it, fell in love and signed that day. It was one of those vehicles that you cant wait to get ahold of. Had a slight problem with the window gear but it was fixed right away. I feel safe and secure while driving and can ""beat"" most any car that even dares to try and race me :) It's small, unique, cute, fast and reliable. Every where I go, people ask what I'm driving and want a ride. I feel amazing knowing I haven't seen one of the C30's on the road since I first noticed them back in January!!  "
volvo,c30,2008,Kathy, 05/22/2009,Driving for Fun,5,"I purchased my Volvo three months ago and find myself driving around town and listening to music, not going anywhere.  I love the ride and the feel and the super good looks.  So many people have commented on it!  I get 26 mpg around town with an automatic.  I am shorter than average and thought I needed to sit high to see well, but the C30 is positively panoramic. I feel great about my choice.   "

It's great to have a unique sporty car that's not seen everywhere, such as the Mini or VW GTI. There are a lot of aftermarket performance parts that owners are tricking-out their C30s with now. I'd suggest a used 2008 or 2009 with low miles on it. Same exact powerful engine for both years.  "
volvo,c30,2008,lgibsonjr, 04/03/2010,2 years later,4,"I purchased my C30 new in December 2007. Over two years later I still love this car. If it weren't for routine maintenance I wouldn't know how well the service department at my Volvo dealer operates. My C30 still delivers in the city and on the highway. I'm 49 years old, have had alot of cars, but this has to rate as my best yet."
volvo,c30,2008,Mr. Morris, 07/29/2010,Exactly what I wanted,5,"I bought this after looking for 4 months for cars, using price, options, powertrains, looks and several other things.  Minus not being AWD, I was able to get everything I wanted nothing I didn't need. I was able to steal mine for 22k after I put 32.5k in options on it.  sometimes I hate the way it looks but its a love hate thing(it's cause it's a hatchback) and I love the drive.  no matter how I feel my ride centers me.  I have put a lot into since I bought, being 25 I couldn't help but want more power agility and style.  Always still even now grabs eyes and the great feeling when someone take a shot of it with their cell phone. find buy love.  "
volvo,c30,2008,Dave, 10/18/2007,Volvo Smooth,4,"This car is great.  It zips around like a sportster, while being extremely comfortable, smooth riding and safe.  It has average acceleration and fuel economy if you accelerate at 2,500 - 3,000 rpms.  But hammer down the gas pedal and at 5,000 - 5,500 rpms you are getting a thrust of acceleration.  Of course that thrust comes at a price of lower fuel economy."
volvo,c30,2008,drsherry, 03/29/2008,My Baby,4,"""Baby"" drives like a luxury car, which took a little getting used to (heated leather seats, smooth steering, quiet engine, etc). She can take off like a space rocket, especially going uphill, pushing me back into the seat. It makes me laugh right out loud--as does the incredible sound system! The BLIS system is very useful, as are the front and rear fog lights. The backseat is suprisingly roomy. Overally, I'm very happy."
volvo,c30,2008,Young 40, 02/01/2008,Great Combo,4,"I spent many hours on the internet and many weeks preparing to buy this car. Our family has a minivan and needs an Accord but this car won me over big time. There are many practical reasons to get a Honda, but the C30 adds so much to my driving experience while maintaining a sense of class that it became a perfect fit. I am 40, but not ready to drive a 40 year old no matter how much ""sense"" it makes. The C30 has a simple but well built and easy to use interior. The exterior styling is very unique. The T5 mated to the MT is the way to go. Almost got the AT at wife's request but the MT was too fun to drive and brought the car to life even more. Chose the 2.0 for styling and audio reasons."

volvo,c30,2008,Dejuan, 08/03/2008,Try the diesel,3,"You Americans always make me laugh when mumbling and complaining about fuel economy and car prices. I have one of the first C30's diesel available (July 2007) 1.6 summum, 110 Hp, 0-100 (km) 10s, top speed 195km/h List price 30.000,- Euro, is like 45.000 US dollars. Diesel per liter euro 1,50, is like US dollar 2,25  The comfort and handling are great. For the US market I would suggest the 2.0 diesel (136 Hp) or the D5, (165- 180 Hp)  Why not try diesel instead of petrol. In Europe a petrol car is almost a sin. "
volvo,c30,2008,C30Grant, 07/26/2008,Stand Out With A Volvo C30,4,"I have had my C30, with automatic geartronic trans, for about a month now. The acceleration is incredible and the shifting is smooth. It can orner at a fairly fast speed and stay in control. I tinted the rear hatch window and the two rear passenger fixed windows with a dark tint. I tinted the two roll-up windows with a lighter tint and the car looks even more cool now. "
volvo,c30,2008,Dave, 10/04/2007,Volvo Smooth,5,"This car is the perfect blend of styling, performance, safety and utility.  The car has power when I need it (turbo engine), a hatchback for carrying cargo, all the Volvo safety features, and all the while looking great."
volvo,c30,2008,Stephanie, 06/03/2008,Reliable and Fun,4,"I purchased this car the minute it came out in October. I have put 17,000 miles on the car and have driven it across country 3 times. I was disappointed that cruise control was not standard  but I added it for 250 dollars after my first cross country trip. It has been extremely reliable and handles beautifully.  It handles mountain roads smoothly and never loses acceleration no matter what the grade is. It is extremely comfortable and spacious and I have sat in it for 12 hours at a time. It also has amazing cargo capacity once seats are folded down.  My only problem is that ulphostery beneath the glove compartment did come undone but it was easily repaired. "

volvo,c30,2008,Yoquiero Unapatada, 06/21/2008,Hands down fantastic auto,4,"The C30 handles beautifully. Fast. Super zippy! I live in Los Angeles, where quick acceleration is part of the traffic landscape. The design of the C30 is purely amazing! Also, many people are under the impression that this vehicle costs more than 40k. These things matter to a 40 yr old  like me.."
volvo,c30,2008,ted, 06/27/2008,Most excellent,4,"Excellent car, handles like a dream, gets off the line fairly quickly. It could use some extra torque though, and you should do everything in your power to stay away from potholes (I cringe at the slam of my 18 inch wheels over concrete expansion joints), but luckily with its superb handling, you can avoid them without difficulty. The sound system is unreal, the car is just one huge menu system. Everything can be changed, adjusted, and tweaked to your exact specifications. I wish the front didn't look exactly the same as the S40 and V50, but it's a small price to pay for having the coolest car around."
volvo,c30,2008,RapidRick, 09/05/2008,The Anti Lemming Mobile,5,"Purchased my C30 OSD in Mar, picked it up & drove it in Sweden over Memorial Day and picked it up again in Tampa in July.  The car is a stunner and draws rave reviews from folks, especially the younger crowd, but plenty of wiser enthusiasts have forced me to chat with them about it.  The turbo comes on smooth and fast.  Going 115 in this car is like going 30 in my great ZTW. Real easy to bust way over the speed limit, if you don't pay attention.  Mine is in matte Gold, which the factory said there were not many made, and supposedly that's the only car Volvo makes that you can get in matte gold (?)  "
volvo,c30,2008,cadyjw, 09/16/2008,2008 C30 R-Design,4,"I traded a Focus and Sky and got the best of both worlds- the functionality of the Focus and nearly the power of the Sky Turbo. I call it my ""hybrid"". The fit and finish is a real step up. Of all the small luxury vehicles the C30 is the best choice- more stylish and sportier than the A3 and much more roomy than the Mini. As far as the other small vehicles like the Civic, Corrola, etc. they cannot even start to compare."
volvo,c30,2008,volvosmith, 11/21/2008,Volvo has outdone itself,5,"Volvo has outdone itself in the styling department. I get people coming up to me all the time asking what I am driving and how do I like it? I have nothing but praise for this car from a person who has owned three Volvos of old and a Mercedes before this wonderful example of Scandinavian design. The Version 1 comes standard with a lot of features so I really did not feel the need to add anything much extra. Driving this car is a blast with great power. Get the manual transmission. You won't be sorry.  And the whirling sound of the inline 5 turbo is fantastic. The build quality is on par with the competitors and the structure is as stiff as the old Mercedes, maybe better.  "
volvo,c30,2008,C30Owner1983, 01/05/2009,Great Car,4,"After owning a Ford Focus and a Pontiac Vibe, this is by the best hatchback I have owned.  I fell instantly in love with the unique design the moment I saw at an auto show.  Anyone who loves attention will love this car, I couldn't count how many times people stop me to ask me about my car plus the looks, stares, and pointing.  I've only had one issue so far.  The shifter would bind up, but it was covered by warranty and its been smooth ever since.  Acceleration is great, handling is superb, interior is simple and comfortable, MPG is nothing too spectacular but still good.  Also, it handles decently in the snow, but in SE PA we never really get that much snow anyway."
volvo,c30,2008,hotX3, 01/12/2009,Enjoyable Swede Steed,5,"We bought this on the Factory Delivery, plan and my wife was nervous about driving through Norway, so I got the pleasure. Lots of power and sharp handling, especially around the mountains. You can drive under all conditions for long periods without aches or fatigue. Mileage is decent at 25 overall with auto. Great visibility too. It drives at up to 80 mph with no perception of being pushed at all - the speed control wife didn't even know to tell me to slow down."
volvo,c30,2008,annabelle, 12/28/2007,Wow,4,"I struggled between getting a Mini Cooper S and this car, and couldn't be happier with my choice. Add fun factor to smoother ride, a powerful motor, great sound system and easy to use. Suddenly, I love to drive!  And let's not forget ergonomic seats (great on long drives) and good trunk space, especially with seats down - fit a massage table, luggage for two, gifts and a large reclining beach chair no problem!"

I get approx 22 mpg combined (mostly city & little highway) and 29 mpg highway on long trips. I still don't see many on the road in southern california, but that makes it even more cool! "
volvo,c30,2008,lgibsonjr, 01/05/2008,First Small Hatchback,4,"I read all the reviews and test drove several small hatchbacks before selecting the Volvo C30 (with only one option - automatic transmission). The C30 standard features met all my other requirements. Overall, it cost less than the Audi A3, has more comfort than the Volkswagon GTI, and enough power to compete with both. Personally I don't like to ""feel the road"" as much as some, and I enjoy the unique styling. The C30 is a nice blend of sportiness and comfort at a reasonable price. One added benefit is the fact you don't see many of them on the road (yet) so it stands out in the crowd."
volvo,c30,2008,JT79, 03/04/2010,2008 C30 2.0,4,"Great all-around sporty car.  I was particularly impressed by the build quality and ride of the vehicle.  From my research I knew that it was a going to be a quick and versatile little car, but I was blown away by just how well it was put together and how well it rode on the highway.  The suspension is a perfect blend between performance and luxury.  It's not quite as nimble as a Mini Cooper or GTI but it doesn't beat you up nearly as much either and it blows either of those cars away in terms of power and power delivery.  "
volvo,c30,2008,CarDude, 02/11/2008,"A niche, but if you fit, this is the car",4,"I wanted something fun, but not one of the Racer Boy cars.  I have kids, but I'm more likely to be alone and take the wife's VW Passat with the family.  This car just FIT.  Excellent fuel economy, power when you want it, and space to take things.  Can even tow or mount stuff on the roof if needed.  Interior is very unique.  Some buttons take some getting used to, but overall a really nice stylish design.  I like the two rear seats as they didn't try to squeeze in 3.  Access with manual seats is great.  Comfort is good as long as you put the short people in back.  Volvo seats just seem to fit really nice for the long haul.  Even the carpet in the back doesn't seem to be a dog hair magnet."
volvo,c30,2008,lola, 02/21/2008,Wheeeee! Fun and luxury.,4,"I haven't had this much fun with a car since I traded in my '72 Volvo 144 for a 1982 Rabbit.  Acceleration in 3rd gear pushes me back in the seat and I'm practically giggling when I have the excuse to lean on the gas to merge onto the highway.  Once there, it's incredibly quiet, 6th gear keeps the revs down, and handling is reliable and predictable.  I got the non-sports (1.0) model and the ride is very comfy. This car is great.  It's got the original tires which aren't great in snow, but they're not bad either.  Mileage depends on how you drive (duh).  I can push it some and still get the 20 mpg the EPA promises. I've only had it for 1000 miles; I'm infatuated."
volvo,c30,2008,JJAY, 09/24/2007,Smooth Operator,4,"This  car is solid and smooth. The performance is pretty good. Gas mileage is excellent. I love the fact that you can cruise and it feels like it's bigger than it is, however as you press on the pedal the car responds."
volvo,c30,2008,JJay, 10/02/2007,The real deal,5,"I was looking at the Mazdaspeed3 and while searching the internet, the C30 came up. I went to the local Volvo dealership and the test drive changed my mind. The car is fast, smooth, and well built. This car rides like a luxury car until you press on the accelerator  and that's when the car reveals the power within. Gas mileage is good unless you have a habit of flooring the pedal."
volvo,c30,2008,Jon, 10/09/2007,Show Stopper,4,The car is quick and reliable. I've had more than a few people stop and comment about my car. Not too impressed with the gas mileage but I did drive a civic before this.
volvo,c30,2008,Pete, 11/26/2007,I love it!,5,"I considered buying Impreza WRX or Mazda Speed3, have driven both. The Volvo really matches my style of driving, low RPM with a lot of torque, firm and comfortable suspension. I love interior, and exterior. Built quality is very good, audio and driving experience is amazing. I do really recommend this car for your consideration. "
volvo,c30,2008,Rob S., 11/27/2007,Very Enjoyable.,4, It gets a lot of looks!  It gets up and goes as soon as you get around 3500 RPM.  I'm use to cars with much larger engines however this car motors effortlessly without much engine noise.  The controls are easy to manage and the upgraded sound system is great!  A must have!  The only one thing I dislike is that you feel every bump in the road.  Otherwise great car.
volvo,c30,2008,Scott, 03/09/2008,Great car for the price,4,I bought this car mainly because no other car looks like it and it has the power when you need it. I test drove several other cars but this one just got me from the first drive. I am 38 years old with a wife and 2 kids. I did not want the boring family car or the SUV.  The wife has the SUV so we take her truck when we go out or travel. I travel about 70-100 miles per day so I need a car with good gas mileage.  I am getting over 25 miles on mixed driving which is good for a turbo car. Volvo wanted a car where the consumer can customize the car with the options you want.     
volvo,c30,2008,chefdude, 03/11/2008,Fun and Safety,4,"Oh what fun it is to ride... knowing you're surrounded by all those safety features! Had the C30 for a month and love it. The seats are unbelievably comfy and the front legroom is spacious (if no one is in the back seat). If you have a dog check to see if he can get climb up the hatch because is quite high off the ground. Power and handling are super. Engine and transmission feel responsive yet flexible; can shift from 2nd straight to 6th gear on freeway, no problem. Clutch is easy to push, won't fatigue leg. Stock stereo is powerful and has aux input for any mp3 player. Cabin storage a little tight but helps with clutter. Altogether a nice car, I'm very happy with my purchase.  "
volvo,c30,2008,greenweenie, 03/11/2008,A Driver's Fun Vehicle,4,"This vehicle was acquired in Jan 08. The worst winter in recent times for Michigan soon made it painfully obvious that the high performance Pirelli Rosso tires are not proper for locales that receive any measureable amount of snow. These tires immediately become road slicks and the vehicle will go nowhere. On dry or wet pavement, they are outstanding. Potholes are deadly for any tire, but for these Pirellis, it is certain immediate bankruptcy! "
volvo,c30,2008,S.M., 03/28/2008,Awesome Car,5,"Got the car last week. I love it, it is so much fun to drive. I also love that you don't see many on the street so you find people looking at your car wondering what it is. It has the perfect balance of a sports car and yet keeps the sophisticated feel of a Volvo. Much better buy than other cars in its class such as the volvo GTI, Civic SI, Mazda Speed 3, or Mini Cooper S. Test drove the rest and thought this one was the best choice."
volvo,c30,2008,rwisem, 04/29/2008,Unique and fabulous,4,"Fell in love with the design and the test drive clinched the deal.  Ordered custom built.  Terrific to drive, comfortable and quiet, but is a tiger when you step on it.  The sound system may be the best stereo I've ever owned and I don't have the 10 speaker Dynaudio set up"
volvo,c30,2009,Mike C, 06/21/2016,A car that makes me smile every time I drive it.,5,"I bought my 2009 C30 used and have now owned it for 3 years. I had test drove a Focus RT and a Veloster Turbo but just fell in love with the C30.  I found the build quality and ride to be so much better than the other two cars. Although mine is a barebones Model (does not even have cruise control), the prior owner had had all the work done on the car at the dealership. As such, it was very well taken care of.  Interior of the care is simple but effective. I am not a small person but find it very comfortable in the front seat. Although the back seats are supposed to be ""roomy"", I have long legs so there would be no leg room behind me. Besides, it is always a pain to get in and out of the back seat of a small coupe. As such, no one but my dog rides in the back seat. It did not take me very long to get used to the 'waterfall' control system and now find it very easy to use. Performace, the car is great. Yes, it does not get the best fuel economy but it is a performance car. If I wanted fuel economy I would have bought the Focus or the Veloster. The engine produced plenty of horse-power and I have yet to have an issue merging or passing. But what I really like is that the power and performance are matched to a great ride. I love taking this car to my parents hours (6 hours away). The looks of the car are what really drew me to it. It has a unique look that stands out in the sea of hatchbacks. However, that looks does come at a cost. The hatch itself smaller than the rest of the storage area so it does limit the size of objects you can carry in the back. Since I do not have people ride in the back seat, I can fold them down and have lots of room. Also, the large B-pillars do make it difficult to see, producing some large blind spots. The only issue I have had with this car in three years is a bad PCV. This  caused the engine to ""whistle"" as well as the check engine light to come on. It was not exactly a cheap fix (I had the dealer fix it) but it is all good now. If you have a Volvo with this engine and you hear the engine ""whine"" or ""whistle"" then get it to a repair shop quickly as delaying could cause my greater damage. (I was able to avoid that.) But given that this is a 7 year old used car, I guess that is not bad. I would recommend this to anyone wanted a fun hot hatch (either with no kids or small kids).

volvo,c30,2009,Paul, 03/01/2010,"Best in Class, Value and Otherwise",4,"Strangely, this exquisite, sophisticated car is being overlooked in rankings because its drive isn't quite as ""fun"" as other cars.  Meanwhile, it has twice the warranty of the far less dependable VW's, and has a solid reputation for reliability and has best in class safety.  Being a grown up, I value those two aspects far more than the fun factor, which to me is represented well enough by the zippy engine, which, btw, is the same engine you get on most of the more expensive Volvos, so its a deal at this price.  The C30s cost of ownership due is extremely low due to the expanded warranty package that makes it much more like buying a BMW, but for much less money.  Best value anywhere."
volvo,c30,2009,D, 03/15/2010,Great little car,4,"We bought a C30 on our return to the US after a few years overseas. Previously we'd owned a 2003 VW GTi and a 2001 Porsche Boxster but now we only need one car. The C30 has everything we require -- more refined than the VW and, okay, not a Porsche but much cheaper to run.  Space is fine for the two of us and the performance is more than good enough.  When we bought it the trip computer software had not been loaded.  The dealership's salespeople said it wasn't available on the manual.  This simply was not true and the mechanics at the dealership installed it in a few minutes when we took it for its first service."
volvo,c30,2009,kevin, 11/27/2009,Still brings a smile to my face,4,"After researching all small hatchbacks in the US market and test driving the Subaru Impreza WRX and the Mazda 3, I test drove the C30 and knew it was the one. (I also wanted to test the Audi A3 but the dealer did not have any in stock.) I use this car daily (23,000 miles in year one) both in heavy traffic and on the open road. It is very responsive and comfortable in all driving conditions.  I chose the Geartronic transmission (auto+manual) due to heavy traffic and enjoy driving in both modes. This car has been great, and it gets lots of positive attention.  Check out Volvo's website - you can fully custom order your C30. I'm so glad to have done so - haven't seen a twin yet in 22000 mi!"
volvo,c30,2009,scott fortune, 02/01/2010,2009 C30 great car,4,"My 2009 c30 is a very cool car and I have had it for almost one year.   I get about 23 mph and have taken it from Jacksonville, Florida to ft. Lauderdale 2 times, for fun.  The trip goes quickly and is very pleasant.  My wife and I also own a 2008 Porsche Cayman s.  We both often prefer the c30 because it is so much easier to drive... Easy and fun with room for groceries.  I had 2 Volvo xc90's, dating back to 2004 or 2003.  The c30 is much cooler and more fun. The dynaudio is an excellent option.  I have automatic, leather, sunroof, Cruise, bluetooth, ipod compatible.  I recommend it and would buy another one."

volvo,c30,2009,davido, 01/16/2010,New C30 is having many issues,2,"Decided to trade my 2006 S40 for a new C30. Since I've had the car, the passenger airbag light shows that the airbag is not on sometimes when passengers sit there. The first time I was told nothing was wrong with it, but it surfaced again. At the same time I noticed an oil leak in my garage. The car has 500 miles on it, and I wish I had the one with 85,000 that I traded in. This time, they told me that the airbag issue was a software upgrade problem (not sure why they didn't do this before delivering to me or last time it was in). Oil is from the oil cooler."
volvo,c30,2009,New c30 owner, 06/27/2009,New volvo experience,4,"In general I am happy with my volvo c30 purchase. The 6 spd manual is fun to drive and it does carry a sleek look that is not too common. However I am missing the rear wheel drive fun of my last vehicle (mercedes c230). Really satisfied about the 5 yr bumper- to-bumper, 5 yr maint plus wear and tear I got with this purchase. "
volvo,c30,2009,Jonathan, 03/10/2018,My 3rd Volvo,5,"Sporty, clean lines, well thought out and fun to drive.  I've had more people say they like the looks of the car very much and does it drive as well as it looks. My answer is yes. It has great acceleration 5cyl turbo and a light weight little car- zips.  it gets great gas mileage..about 27 around town and 32 on the open road, and has required only standard maintenance.  If a buyer is looking for a sporty two door, and understands that you and your passengers have to be rather agile to get and and out of the car, there are few negatives.

volvo,c30,2009,wm, 01/14/2009,Fun Car,4,"Caveat this review with the fact I've only owned the car for a week, and I'm still on a buzz from buying it. The manual is incredibly fun to drive, and very smooth. I highly recommend the R-design; it's well worth the money. Cosmic Wht w/ Brwn body kit looks phenom'l, but hard to find at a dealer. It is not a utilitarian vehicle, as the rear bumper is too high and big, and other cars offer more interior space, but it's a great little sports car. More hp/less weight/better mpg than a V6 Mustang. Comfort inside is top notch. Driver views are very good.  I did a 1300+ mile trip right after purchase and it holds 80mph easily at 2700rpm. It accelerates the same at 40mph as it does at 70. Fun."
volvo,c30,2009,New C30 Owner, 05/02/2009,Love this car!,4,"Not the fastest thing out there, but no slouch.  Nice balance between comfort and performance.  Will do the daily commute in style while still offering some great spirited driving when the whim strikes.  Can work as a family care for small families.  My kids love riding in it.  Cargo is small, but 3 Staples copy paper boxes fit in a single layer with the seats up.  Not huge space, but very usable.  Width will allow a McLaren folding stroller to just fit.  Great storage around the spare tire for all those things you should have like jumper cables and ice scrapers but don't need just floating around the car.  Basically a well thought out little luxury car."

Solid ride, nimble handling, low road noise, comfortable and ergonomic for driver, and styling is a standout from the rest of the crowd.  Interior, dash, & instrumentation is clean and utilitarian.

volvo,c30,2009,SAAB 9-2X owner, 06/22/2009,C30 T5 R-Design WOW,4,I currently own and drive an '05 SAAB 9-2X Aero loaded with everything sport & winter packages etc. etc. I test drove a fully loaded C30 T5 R-Design last Friday. It was similar to my SAAB-aru in handling and quickness but has a quieter ride and with more safety features. I was very impressed with everything about this car. I especially liked the six speed manual trans.
volvo,c30,2009,jasper, 11/16/2009,after a year some issues,4,"Just over a year with low mileage, ~12000.  R-Design has great styling. The dash is a bit bland and more color could be added in the dash console lighting. Gas mileage is not quite what I expected, (6 speed manual) ranges from 31 to 21 (depends on time of year and how I drive).  The front end on the RDesign is also poorly engineered.  There is nothing you can do to prevent scraping when going up small upgrades (my driveway for example).  This causes the rubber on the underside to hang down, quite an eyesore.  "

In the 1st 200 miles, my passenger air bag was not working (pregnant wife refuses to ride in my new car now). The service depat. told me that they couldn't fit it in on a Saturday...too many more important oil changes I suppose.The dealer kept it for 3 days, and now the problem seems to have resolved itself.  This morning (mile 500) I have an oil leak under my car. I'm seeing that quality and safety are no longer top priorities with Volvo. Time to take it back again...more time off from work.  Wish they would give me back my working trade-in so I could go elsewhere."

Yes, there were cheaper cars I was considering, such as a VW Rabbit, but I am now beginning to appreciate the upscale craftsmanship that makes my Volvo a really fine car.  I am also beginning to appreciate that as a Volvo owner, I am now part of a demographic of more conservative and mature drivers."
volvo,c30,2009,Colin, 12/26/2008,One rockin' hatch,4,"Great all-around car, exceptionally well-executed and excels at what it was designed to do -- turn heads!  Love the power even with the auto trans, especially the down-low torque, and all the electronic goodies (Dynamic audio, sat radio, iPod).  And oh, those Volvo seats! Incredibly comfortable on my 1-hr commute.  My wife and I both get lots of compliments on the car's appearance, especially the all-glass hatch. I hate driving cars that everyone else has, and to date I've only seen two other C30s on the road. Huge cache factor. Respectable gas mileage (23 mpg avg on a mix of city/hwy driving). And no need for premium! Get the R-design package, it really makes the car's appearance pop."
volvo,c30,2009,FormerTruckOwner, 02/10/2009,This is what I was looking for,4,"I've only had this car a few weeks, but was looking for almost 2 years.  Drove a truck.  Was perfect when I got it, but now I have wife, kids, dog, and commute.  I needed a practical car, but needed to carry the family on occasion, carry the dog, make dump runs, tow, and be comfortable day to day.  I'd also like something fun that had a little power, but not a huge engine.  I knew I wanted a small luxury type car, but they are almost absent in the USA.  Especially in a hatchback (for the dog).  But in looking at the Mazda 3, I found out about the Ford C1 platform and the fact that the Mazda, Volvo, and European Ford Focus are built on it.  This is the car I was looking for.  Nothing else fit"
volvo,c30,2009,vicki walker, 05/30/2009,C30 rocks,4,"This is my first Volvo. I wanted something sporty, sexy and safe. The C30 is all of these. This unique vehicle looks  and drives like a sports car; yet, there is still room for kids or pets. My car came loaded with features I really did not think I needed, but now I have discovered that the bluetooth is heaven; the moon roof lights up my ride; the heated seats are cool and the stereo  makes for a sweet commute.  I love my new C30!"
volvo,c30,2009,Terri, 12/19/2009,Just Right,4,I literally test drove 12 vehicles and kept coming back to the C30.  I love the size after driving a station wagon for so many years.  It's easy to fit in spaces and maneuver city streets. Can't understand why they aren't more popular because there are so many great features.  I was looking for a car with good pick up and boy does this have it.  I love my new little car.  
volvo,c30,2009,Rich, 04/10/2018,Super fun sleeper car,4,"Relatively high cost of ownership. Recommend running premium fuel. Even regular maintenance and repairs are $$. Would not own this car if I didn't have a friend who is a Swedish car guru, does most work for 1/2 what the shop charges.

It's the ""classic style"" before they changed the look of the front end. I'm very satisfied with the performance and reliability. I have over 52,000 on mine without any problems to speak of.
This is a great, fun to drive car that's a head-turner. I would suggest that you stay away from the light colored leather seats that wear poorly.

I have gotten more favorable comments about the C30 than any car I've owned.  It's a sort of cult classic already.  Fun to drive, great for urban transport, I can even take adults in back without apologizing.  I've had it for 6 months and really love this car. "
volvo,c30,2010,Hondo123, 12/07/2009,Just Right,4,"We test drove a Mazda 3, Nissan Altima, and Mini Cooper S with the C- 30 as the spoiler.  We found the Mini to ride HARD, have severely limited visibility, weird pedal placement, cramped, found the center speedo and other quirks just too annoying, and we know someone who sold theirs because it was too scary in the snow.  We found the C-30 to be in a class by itself - a highly refined vehicle for an amazingly reasonable price.  Fast, fun, engaging, safe, this purchase ended up being a no-brainer.  Only downside is that Volvo dealerships don't appear to be too willing to deal.  (Same w/Mini.)  A LOT of car for the money.  This vehicle is a class leader.  See for yourself.  We're very happy."
volvo,c30,2010,Stephen, 04/03/2016,Sweet Ride!,5,"I got the automatic C30 R-Design last August 2015 when there was just over 58,000 miles on the odometer and have since added over 10,000 miles. My previous car was a 2000 Buick LeSabre so I was looking for a vehicle that provided a similar ride but had a bit of fun factor to it. I also need a car that has good seats as I have a bad back. The car is also parked on a city street, so I wanted something smaller that could easily be parked and not get dented. I looked at a 2015 Mini Cooper S, a 2014VW GTI, and this car. The Mini was my favorite when it came to its quirky design but it ends there; the mechanics and overall comfort was pathetic for such an expensive vehicle. I also decided against it when I learned that the Hardtop failed a side impact safety test (which the dealership claimed they fixed by adding more interior padding). The next car I tried was the VW GTI. It was an okay vehicle but the ride was harsh, the seats were hard and not as supportive as older models, and the materials were just cheap (worse than the Mini and that's saying a lot). I then found my 2010 Volvo C30. The seats are impressive but I guess that's to be expected as they are the only ones in the market to be designed by orthopedic surgeons. I was greatly surprised to discover that the C30 has a softer ride than the Buick LeSabre. The car has great vision and safety, as it has large windows and is equipped with BLIS (though I have not turned it on yet). The vehicle also weighs over 4300 pounds, which is heavier by at least 1500 pounds compared to the Mini and VW. The Volvo C30 attracts a lot of attention wherever I go because of its unique design and its great engine note when starting or accelerating. The Volvo has also been very reliable with only oil changes needed. The only downside, but not really for a car this awesome, is the mileage. On premium, I can only get 22.8 mpg in mixed driving but highway mpg easily reaches 32 mpg.
"
volvo,c30,2010,TwelveCrows, 10/07/2010,Industrial Chic,4,"I am a big fan of the Ford C1 platform. Prior to my C30, I owned an 04 Mazda 3s; I loved it. But as much as I did, it pales in comparison to the C30. It is more comfortable and more solid with a more powerful and responsive engine. Other than the wind noise coming from the side mirrors, the cockpit is quiet-isolating the road noise and allowing the driver to hear that throaty growl when the foot presses to the floor.  The automatic transmission is smooth- though I've only used the manual shift feature once. The only problem here is that 227 hp driving front wheels can sometimes make the tires slip- with heavy acceleration like pulling out into traffic. The GTI doesn't have this issue."
volvo,c30,2010,dugan001, 12/14/2010,Great Car for A Great Price,4,"My 2nd Volvo, other is a 2001 s60, and am very pleased.
Purchased the base model in Feb of 2009, and for some reason dealer took 6k of the sticker price.
Love the car, drives great and is very fun to drive around town.
The 5 speed auto is very smooth however when I want to have better performance I use the auto shift feature which manually controls the shifting.
Car has all the options I would want, iPhone and Bluetooth work without issues.
I have 5K miles on it and have had no issues. Highly recommend this to anyone considering a mini, which is more expensive and smaller."
volvo,c30,2010,Franky, 02/06/2010,So far so good!!!,4,"Got one of the last 2010's with the old front design. Love the car. Ride is stiff but not as stiff as my old 07 GTI. Engine is strong and satisfying, got it with a 6spd manual. Interior materials are really nice, but a little rattly (more so than girlfriends S40). Stereo and navi are superb, and everyone looks at it on the road...really unique!! No reliability issues so far, the car has a decent exhaust note, and it actually handles really well!! The seats are superb and they look great with the contrast stitching. I found the car to be sluggish with the automatic but quite powerful with the manual trans. Would buy it again if I had to do it all over. "
volvo,c30,2010,Jessica, 04/13/2010,This is a great little car!!,5,"I am really impressed with my C30. It has the 6-speed, climate package, and sunroof. It handles well in snow and rain so far. I am averaging 28 mpg between highway and small town driving. I took it on a 2000+ mile road trip, and even with all the time in the seat, both my husband and I were comfortable. It does great in mountains, in 6th gear you can still accelerate going up hill w/o having to downshift. Everyone that sees it loves it. I have a 2010 with the previous style headlights (leftover from last year). I like that style better though so I was glad when I found one! Mine has the off black interior and the metallic titanium paint, and it looks great in that color! "
volvo,c30,2011,califas, 06/12/2011,Great Driving Experience,4,"In evaluating a car, first you define the mission.
No car can be all things.
If you want a Corvette, you understand that it can't have the gas mileage of a Prius. 

This is the T5 C30 with 17 in wheels:

A small, nimble car with an appealing and distinctive aesthetic that coddles the driver with excellent ride dynamics and great interior design.
 
It is not trying to be a track car.
It is 2+2 GT road car.
It gets you through your driving day with a minimum of fatigue and a maximum of bliss.
It has the quickness and agility to squeeze through traffic, yet still has a cabin that is quiet and comfortable.
Plus, it feels like quality, it is nice to look at, and it is just fun to drive."
volvo,c30,2011,Lauren, 10/17/2010,Forget Mini check out Volvo,4,"I thought I loved my 2007 Mini S convertible, but 2 weeks after warranty ran out I had to pay $500 on maintenance after  I had just spent a $1000 replacing  my run flat tires, I decided to get out before I spent well more than that car was worth...I am so glad that I did. My 2011 C30 is refreshing and my passengers love the upgrade. It is the perfect car for me. I am in my early 30's married with no children, so I rarely have back seat passengers (a must for this car). This car so sophisticated with out being boring or stuffy. Fun, fast and fabulous, I don't understand why more people aren't in love... that's okay because I love having a car that makes a statement the individual."
volvo,c30,2011,jersite, 09/29/2011,Great Car!,4,"Have had my 2011 Volvo C30 for a little over a month now and overall, really love the car.
The styling is amazing, handling great, seats the most comfortable I've ever sat in (heated seats a huge bonus) and great fun to drive.
Other high points are bluetooth which works amazingly well, iPod integration, and great visibility.
Only drawbacks (and minor at best), huge, oversized key, so-so mileage and difficulty accessing rear seat.
All that said, I would recommend the C30 to everyone."
volvo,c30,2011,Robert James G, 06/04/2010,Get it for what it is: a premium hatch.,4,"I've read plenty of reviews stating how this car doesn't measure up to the GTI and Cooper S. I disagree. I used to have a 2008 Cooper S, and it spent months at the shop, had to sell it at a loss. Used to have a MazdaSpeed 3 - great car, but uncomfortable on city streets. The Volvo is a car made for the real world - I don't go to tracks every Saturday; this car ROCKS 95% of the time. It's not the last word on performance and handling, but it's the best mix of comfort and sporty driving I could find. And the exterior - it's just a work of art. I never thought I'd own a Volvo, but I'm happy I do now!"
volvo,c30,2011,rsoldier97, 08/18/2011,HOT!! Volvo C30 R-Design,4,"I test drove several cars to include the Volkswagon GTI and Mazdaspeed 3.
I wanted something with a European feel when driving and this car nailed it.
The Car has more than ample horsepower.
Exterior Styling is a attention grabber.....Going to a new drive thru window always has the kids commenting on the car.
It really is a wonder why there is not many on the road, but it sure does get attention....Interior is a BIT BORING, but I spiced it up with amplifiers.
Kinda upset that door sills are not dressed up like other ""luxury"" brands.
If you want something with performance and not just a kiddie compact tuner cars this will get attention.
My first Volvo and I love it.
Hatch is small."
volvo,c30,2011,jailhousemd, 08/03/2011,Most refined tuner car.,4,"I realize that most people will not consider this a tuner car.
It seems to have all the features of a Mazdaspeed, GTI, etc.
This car is more comfortable than any other car that I have previously owned (GTI, Mazdaspeed, Civic Si).

Nice that I can use 87 octane gas.
MPG so far is a little better than 27 mpg/gallon combined.
I believe it still needs to be broken in.


Also, overall cost is really no different than a loaded GTI.
By the way, I have leather, sunroof, and 100K Maintenance plan.
I do believe that the Mazdaspeed is a little faster, but I am commuting not street racing."
volvo,c30,2011,LMSTENT, 10/26/2010,Nice daily driver,4,"Recently purchased the C30 with 6 speed manual to use as a daily driver. It has a very nice balance between handling and comfort with a bent toward the fun side. The acceleration is decent and the car is nice and solid. For such a small car, I feel safe (I guess typical Volvo) -- the doors are sturdy and the car is heavy for its class. The car is unique in appearance and is general a joy to drive (have put 2,000 miles on the car - so beyond the ""honeymoon"" period. Demerits include slight rattle from both windows when partially down and horrible whistling wind noise from the seatbelt outlets when fully open. Decent but not great Dynaudio sound; manual not up to par with other European cars."

Actual gas mileage has exceeded expectations at 24 mpg around town and 31 mpg on a long highway trip. The distinctive looks draw a bit of attention.
Rides much more comfortably and looks much better than the GTI in my view. Everything simply works well. I'm particularly happy with the cabin ergonomics.
Have not had any wind noise issues as others reported. A refined and reasonably priced car given the free maintenance, especially now that end of year rebates are available. "

I've had the R-Design for about 6 months now and love driving it.
The handling is very tight and the acceleration is good for its class.
The body styling sets you apart from the crowd and the interior styling is comfortable and very functional.
The ability to customize features and options hits the mark.

The only drawback is that the exterior r-design styling features seem a bit flimsy - we'll see how they hold up over time.

I couldn't be happier with this car - at least until the polestar version is available."
volvo,c30,2011,jbreach, 11/08/2010,What About the Breaks?,4,Great looks and peppy engine but what about the breaks.  Brought it back to dealership twice wondering why oh why doesn't this car have a firm break pedal. Why must I travel halfway down before breaks engage and when they do why does it feel so choppy?  Is this a Volvo trademark because if it is I sure don't want or need it.  This one very important aspect has left me lukewarm on this car and wondering if I made a $25k mistake which I will now regret until I trade it in.

It handles even better than advertised, very tigthly built and EXTREMELY fun to drive. Due it's unique design and Volvo doing a poor job of advertising the C30, it's seldom seen on the road, which makes folks stop and look. It's not just another Japanese hatchback/econo box. Most important to us was it's best in class safety rating. We did our homework before we bought the C30 and it exceeded our expectations in all areas"

The C30 has major wind noise issues. This gas milage is aslo poor - 21 in combined city/highway driving.

After 3 months and 1300 miles, had to take the car into the dealer - hissing noise under hood. Leaking either coolant or refrigerant. Only good thing so far is it comes with 5 year 60-month bumper-to-bumper warranty and it looks COOL. If only my wife had chosen a another car or I had waited for the LEXUS CT-200! So buyer beware."

volvo,c30,2011,Volvo Driver, 05/31/2010,2011 C30 R-Design,4,We traded in our 2005 Volvo S40 T5 AWD for this new C30. The C30 is even more fun to drive than the S40 was. I was concerned about ride stiffness from the R-Design with the lower profile tires but while the ride is firmer it is not uncomfortable at all on the roads we drive daily. Our choice of styling was confirmed when a new VW GTI that still had the paper tags on it had the driver and two passengers admiring the C30 when we were running side by side on the expressway.

If you are looking for a reliable European car, this is it, the ride is very confortable for our bad roads.
I selected the 16' wheels for that reason.
I just drove from Vermont to Nova Scotia in 12 hours non stop with zero back problems.

They sold few of these models in U.S. because hatchbacks don't appeal here.  The styling is very attractive and retro.  You will rarely see another one on the road.  Car people notice this rare model and will compliment you about it.  Sweet exhaust note on start up.  2013 is last year sold in U.S. but still being sold in Europe.  Hurry, hurry buy one while you still can.  It is compact with limited rear space but the front space is good.  I am 6'2 and super comfy in front seat.  Built safe, heavy body for small car, look at the doors and body.  They were super expensive when new $35K and depreciated rapidly, typical Volvo.  However I think the limited supply means the values stabilize well starting at the 3 year mark.  10 year old examples sell for big prices.  A lot of used examples have 180K miles still running.

volvo,c30,2012,Woody, 08/13/2018,Loving my new/old C30,5,"It may not be the most practical car in the world,but i love it for what it is. This car has a great ride, very solid and reassuring to drive on twisty mountain passes and interstate highways alike. The engine has power and torque way beyond my requirements, and i love the 6-speed manual transmission. The seats are very comfortable,and the interior noise is minimal. Loved the exterior design when it came out,and it still looks fresh today.
Update: after a year, I am still enjoying the car very much, especially for longer trips. This car is a great highway cruiser.

volvo,c30,2013,coloradocarnut, 09/11/2014,"C30: rare, beautiful, comfortable",5,"This is really a lovely car.  We purchased the last '13 new in July'14.  Auto trans, T-5.  Did TONS of research beforehand.  We are a Toyota/Honda family, so European is a departure, with trepidation.  We have the Premier Plus package, not R-Design.   Thus far, the car is beyond expectations; a joy to drive, beautiful to look at, and well made.  It's QUIET inside, very powerful, and so different. You won't see them often, which is nice too.  It's not a high performance hatch, and that's good, because we didn't want that.  For those w/o kids, and a different hauling vehicle, this is a great commuter that spoils with luxury, is safe, and gives you confidence.  
2017 update; a couple of warranted replacement items with the car; though it continues to be great, and has cool accessories you can get from Volvo. We had some repairs from hitting a curb and major hail damage. After a few trials the rattles and squeaks were eliminated. But it took a few times. Hopefully once warranty expires we won't eat crow. Only complaint is the doors don't have good detents so they fall back into your legs pretty easily. That's it. Dealer support has been beyond expectations. It's sleeper fast.

volvo,c30,2013,Kendra L, 12/01/2017,LOVE this car!!,5,"I flew across the country to buy a certified preowned 2013 last year. It has the 6-speed manual (deal breaker for me without). I drove all the way from Little Rock, AR to Durango, CO in one day. I have never spent a 17 hour day in a car and not had a backache until I did so in this vehicle. The car is an absolute pleasure to drive! Takes off like a rocket ship, but I still manage 35-40 mpg. (I live in a rural area, mostly hwy driving.) I have already put 20k miles on it without any problems, but I am only at 38k total. I have also been very impressed with any Volvo service experience I have had thus far. I have a friend that is absolutely in love with her GTI, but I find my C30 to handle much better and be much more comfortable, albeit a bit smaller. I love that it is a very unique car; you just don't see too many of them on the road. It's very sharp looking car, IMO!

volvo,c30,2013,Joey o, 04/15/2018,I won’t get rid of it,5,"I love this car. I have looked for one for years the way I wanted it optioned. I got a great deal on my r-design with the six speed manual polestar upgrade. It had everything I wanted and no navigation :) I have had it for a year and it’s my first Volvo. I’m sold we bought an r-design XC90 6 months after this one. The build quality is great. Very solid and substantial is the best way to describe it.       I just rolled over 93k and no issues. I have a squeak in the back when it’s cold but that’s been it. The seats are comfy and the bi zenon head lights are the best I’ve ever had in any car hands down. I wish I had reverse parking sensors though. It really moves when you put your foot down. I find it an excellent compromise for warning speed, handling and comfort.  I do a lot of maintenance myself and it’s a little bit more for fluids and air filters but a few bucks is well worth it. I get the compliments others talk about on here. Sometimes even stopped at a light now and again. This is one car I will not get rid of. It’ll be here in the garage for as long as I can see. It’s truly functional and so unique. I’d buy it all over again any day of the week. It’s made a Volvo family out of us.

volvo,c30,2013,djd123, 05/13/2013,Style and Substance,4,"Have owned for 3 weeks now, and the smiles keep coming.
This car is very well put together, looks great, handles well, and has plenty of power on tap when you need it.
It is very comfortable as a daily commuter, even with the stiffer R-Design suspension.
As other reviews across the web have stated, the steering is a bit numb and the manual shift action a bit rubbery compared to other sport coupes/""hot hatches"", but it makes up for it with how well the overall package fits together.
This is a car that somehow seems greater than the sum of it's parts.
Hard to explain."
volvo,c70,2000,Matt, 07/17/2016,Best car I have ever had,5,"This is a wonderful car.  It is reliable and safe.  It is fun to drive.  The kids fit in the back. The top is whisper quiet.  The sound system sounds great... the CD player is early nineties garbage and skips constantly... but it sounds great.  It is powerful enough and performs well.  Don't let the whiny reviews deter you from owning this fabulous car. There are no models of cars that are over 15 years old that don't have some that were treated poorly and require maintenance.  It's silly to think that these experiences inform the common experience.  Look for a good one.  Put the top up and down a few times.  Drive it a few miles.  Take it to a mechanic.  When you find the right one this will be some of the best money you ever spent.

Of course repairs on the car can be a bit pricy but I've had few problems.  The only issue I have had is with the top chime sensor.  It kept going off while driving.  Apparently one of the wires was pinching causing the malfunction.  I am taking the car in this week to have this issue addressed.  Hopefully it won't cost too terribly much.

VERY hard to turn, almost like I am driving a bus, and the rocking motion is just like that of a yellow bus starting to move. When I go for a short distance on city streets it starts smoking. This car is so scary to drive and very frustrating. Never again will I ever buy a volvo."

The leather is peeling on the drivers seat and the sunroof assembly constantly needs to be reglued as the glass seperates from the metal. I've never had a car do this and the darn thing is well taken care of.  Amazing for a car with only 25,000 miles - and the dealer just shrugs...."

definitely turns heads."

I have taken such good care of this car yet I always have to take it to the shop for major problems. It has had electrical problems from day one, the throttle is going out and so is the transmission. There was a recall on the electronic throttle in 06' I was never aware of. From what I have read online this car was just a bad design because everyone else I know with other Volvo models have not had nearly as many problems as I have with the c70. I admit I love its aesthetics because it is so sleek and rare but I spent over eight grand fixing it. Not worth it!"

car for 3 years and it's been GREAT! A 
much better value vs the CLK, which was 
$10k more at the time I bought the 
C70.  Volvo blew it when they stopped 
making the coupe, but I guess that will 
make it even more unique and desirable 
in years to come!"

pleasure to drive anytime, anywhere.  
It does everything well and has the 
Volvo safety and reliability to back 
it up.  Note: I had a small problem 
with the electronic throttle, but the

It is surprisingly quick for a Volvo.  I had to replace the throttle body twice, but Volvo has covered it as a recall item, so it was on their nickel.  I have had it in the shop for only one other significant issue.  The mass airflow sensor went out while I was on a road trip and rendered the car not driveable, which was not at all convenient, but at least an easy fix.  Overall, the reilability has been great.

The back seat room and rear visibility is very good for a convertible. This is my 3rd different 4-seat convertible, and the Volvo easily tops the  others in that area. On the down side, repairs have been more frequent than I had expected given Volvo's reputation, and much more expensive than I'd like. The cowl shake and suspension crashing over railroads and potholes is frighteningly bad. But when the sun is out, the top is down, and the road is smooth, the C70 is a great joy to drive.

EVER driven. It would NOT stay on the 
road (and I got it virtually new).  It 
was downright dangerous. With the top 
down you could not have a conversation 
with a companion.  It was incredibly 
loud. The cup holders are the flimsiest 
things.  This sounds petty, but after 
you have spilled a few drinks while 
cornering it ceases to be trivial.  The 
top is stunningly slow to put up and 
down and can be cranky. Aside from all 
this... it is hard to make the carefree 
feeling of convertible driving mesh 
with the ultra conservative reputation 
of a Volvo.  There is a reason they do 
not make them in 2002.  Good decision."

every 4-6 weeks. From doors that pop 
open while driving, interior parts 
coming unstitched/falling off, seats 
that don't work, cheap interior 
materials, check engine light that 
malfunctions - the list goes on. Volvo 
and my dealer have been very helpful 
and accommodating in repairing the 
vehicle, plus always suppling a loaner 
car. Every time I get excited about the

It took over 3 months of searching to

worth the wait.  Handling is 
phenomenal.  A joy to drive on a 
winding country road. The pick up is 
great.  First gear to  about 15 mph.  
Shift into second, hit the gas and the 
turbo kicks in to push you back in your 
seat.  Even at highway speeds there is 
plenty of power left for a quick 
acceleration to pass or avoid another 
car or just for the fun  of it.  The 
C70 is traditional Volvo quality and 
sturdiness.  Even with hard driving I 
am able to mainatian gas mileage of 
20.7 MPG.  My recommendation is go out 
and get one now."

are some minor, but frustrating things, 
however, that need change.
  1. make the driver's side sunshade 
movable to protect against side sun;
  2. change the stupid gas cap system 
that triggers a ""check engine"" symbol 
when it is not screwed on just right - 
there is no notice of this in the

  3. fix the front seats to move

volvo,c70,2001,Errigal, 11/08/2003,My Fun Car,4,"This was my first fun car and 
convertible and I have no regrets!!!  
This is truly a classy, elegant, sexy 
and sporty vehicle that also provides 
Volvo safety and practicality.  My job 
involves regional travel and this baby 
has been a blast to drive with the top 
down.  I am not the best driver of 
mountain roads but with this car I am 
confident.  It just whips around those 
mountain curves and hugs the road while 
the wind whips through your hair and 
the music plays on one of the best 
sound systems. If you are shy and don't 
want to be noticed wherever you go, 
don't buy this car....otherwise, go for 
it!!!!  "
volvo,c70,2001,sixtto, 11/09/2003,Stylish Annoyance,4,"Fun to drive when the top is down.
Otherwise back seat is useless and 
annoying to put anything in due to 
annoyingly slow motorized seats.
Visibility out rear view mirror with 
top up is annoyingly non-existent.
Mechanical problems have been annoying 
but fixed at no charge --recurring 
front end turning issue that goes away 
briefly only to annoyingly return.
OPening window or door in rain gets 
car wet."

When it was new had lots of people

problem was passenger front window came 
off track."
volvo,c70,2001,rc jim, 03/21/2005,Where's the fun,3,"We bought the volvo for fun.  The honeymoon wore off real quick.  This has to be the noiseiest car i have ever ridden in.  I have the same issues as other reviewers, bad cup holders, can't see out the back window, non moving sun shade, gas cap light (check engine). Enough bad it is a great looking car and the lifting and lowering of the top turns heads.  "
volvo,c70,2001,alltaurus, 04/22/2005,Good looking Lemon,3,"Horrible suspension causes breaks and leaks.  No turn radius.  Its a beautiful car that is fun to ride, but too many trips to the dealership for a high priced luxury vehicle."

I would still not own it.  I bought it used and got a great deal but if I bought off the lot at $43,000 list I would be very upset.  I have had lots of small problems, cd player broken, leaks at window seals, bad wind noise with windows up, cowl shake, small engine issues, and the lights blow constantly. I am shocked to have these issues with a high priced Volvo. I would have gotten rid of this car by now if it was no for the fact that it is fun with the top down and you can actually get adults comfortably in the back.  "
volvo,c70,2001,MES, 05/01/2003,Fun in the Sun with the C70,4,"Fun to drive; no major problems; did 
have problems with the two front side 
windows, Volvo provided a replacement 
kit but they are the one weak spot. The 
trunk is very small but will hold two 
sets of golf clubs in average bags (no 
Pro bags). It does accelerate very 
well. I replaced the factory tires with 
Bridgestones and the handling is much 
better."

convertible and lived to regret it.  I would 
never recommend a Volvo after the 
problems I had with the car.  Additionally, 
the dealer lied on several points, and Volvo 
corporate did everything they could to avoid 
taking responsibility for their car with all it's 
problems."

volvo,c70,2002,Byron, 07/04/2008,Life Saver,5,"Engine was sound and performed exceptional, however she was put down in June of 2008. I my wife & two kids traveled the 405 south bound in the carpool lane. A diesel trucks tire traveling north bound became dislodged (rim included). Now airborne crossed several lanes headed for opposing traffic with exact aim at my windshield. Not being able to move left or right I pushed the accelerator praying the tire would miss the car. No luck! Striking the roof of the car and crashing into the cabin before bouncing off. Insurance company declared the car a total loss. My wife, two kids, and I walked away without a scratch. With superb safety/build qualities 4 souls were saved by Volvo"
volvo,c70,2002,Tempel Riekhof, 04/25/2006,2002 C70 Review,3,"The C70 is very enjoyable to drive with the top down.  Otherwise it is one of the least enjoyable cars we have owned.  The suspension is too stiff for a convertible as that has led to numerous squeaks and rattles for which the dealer has no solution.  One would never know it has power steering and the turning radius is far too wide.  Trunk is negligible as is true with many convertibles.  There is no indicator on the dash showing what gear you or in - just a small silly orange arrow pointing up if you are not in top gear.  The parking light assembly simply fell out.  Leather seats are showing significant wear after only about 30,000 miles.  The mechanism for lowering the top works well."

can be day when I ejoy driving again. 
This is a great car. When yuo hit the 
turbo hold on. My usual commuter car is 
a 2000 BMW 528i but in comparison the 
Bimmer is just taking the family car to 
work. The C70 is just plain fun to 
drive."
volvo,c70,2002,sldghmr, 06/15/2010,Never Again,2,"Like everyone says, it's fun to drive. That's true. My wife's car and it's been the biggest pain to own. We tell our friends that when you look at the car you do not see a single original part, its all been replaced under warranty. No kidding our stack of maintenance receipts looks like a magazine, a thick one. One day while driving I was passenger, the dash just snapped in half. Problem after problem. As I write, it is in the shop for a new fan and fan assembly which is on back order because they ran out. Symptom was smoke coming out of it, never a good symptom. Engine block is the only original under the hood. It's only safe because it rarely runs. But she loves it."
volvo,c70,2002,C70...I like!, 05/13/2003,C70...Thumbs up!,4,"Overall the best car for the money.  I 
thought Volvo's were boring until I 
drove this car.  The seats and driving 
comfort are so nice especially 
compared to the BMW 3-Series...firm 
yet soft.  I find the controls on the 
BMW small but the C70 is very straight 
forward.  The only down side to this 
car is the lack of shifting ability 
for the automatic compared to others 
but do yourself a favor leave it 3-
gear on some back roads and let the 
turbo rev like it should!  I must 
mention that the torque-pull is strong 
if you have a heavy foot...that's ok 
I'll take the power.  "
volvo,c70,2002,maminc70, 12/29/2011,It's a lemon,2,"I bought my 2002 C70 used in 2009.
It ran great for about 6 months & then had a host of problems that caused multiple trips to the shop, including one that lasted 3 months.
The car doesn't always start.
Turning the key over and trying again sometimes works, but Volvo told me that trick as they can't fix it. The transmission slips & it has gotten progressively worse to the point that the car is only reliable for trips under 15 min. Volvo can't diagnose that problem either & suggested changing the trans, but will not guarantee that it's the fix.
The rear windshield has dropped & is suspended by the headliner.
I need an auto upholstery shop to stitch it back in as the glue won't hold."

volvo,c70,2002,Liz, 05/21/2010,Would buy again!,4,"Spacious, comfortable convertible.  Best convertible to accommodate tall driver and has the most room in back seat for passengers vs others. Power top fabulous.  Well placed controls.  This car is in addition to my Corvette when we needed room for three. Sporty, yet functional. Reasonable gas economy.  Good mechanically.  Very reliable. Dealers supply loaner.  Very fair pricing for a fun car!  Only recommend HT convertible with the higher HP and would even like more power, of course!  "
volvo,c70,2002,Travisy, 06/25/2002,Gotta be different,4,"One thing that drew me to the C70 is 
that there aren't a lot of them out 
there.  Seems like you see BMWs 
everywhere but you sure don't see many 
C70s.  I have only had mine about a 
month now and really enjoy it. I live 
it in Italy and trust me it will do 
more than the governed 130mph. I can 
cruise at 100mph with no problems and 
very smooth on the highway.  It also 
fun running through the Italian Alps.  
I sure feel I got my money's worth."

down and has more than enough

After owning (2) BMW 3-series cars including an M-3 I have to say that the Volvo is far more car for the money (especially when buying used). The exterior design is as sexy as it gets, the interior is roomy, and the dash is elegant and easy to use from the get go. The seats get no better, and the Turbo is like Jet propulsion. For driving in the ""Real world"" this rare vehicle is a great pick without question. "

the superior excelation (a little turbo-
lag would have prefered a super-

on her are amazing.  Everytime I go 
into Manhattan and park her the 
attendants always ask how she drives 
and that it is the best looking coupe 
on the planet.  Needless to say it's 
a ""chick-magnet"" and that's a good 
thing!  My sound system is the high

It is my fourth and last Volvo."

was deciding between a BMW 3 series 
coupe and the C70. I was drawn to the 
C70 primarily because of its looks. 
Although the BMW is more of a 
performance car, they are far too 
common, too commercialized. The C70 
coupe is a relatively rare siting. It 
is definitely a head turner. I get 
compliments and questions about it all 
the time. Drives, handles well. Plus, I 
feel safe. 6 air bags!"

4 months ago). I am an avid coupe 
driver, having owned BMW, Mercedes, and 
Jaguar, all in coupe variants. The C70 
is a power house. 236 hp, awesome 
brakes, tight steering, and a killer 
sound system to boot! I traveled a 
little out of the way to get the car 
from Volvo of Fort Washington, one of 
the best dealerships I have ever 
experienced, and a very compassionate 
and fair sales person named Dory 
Chaefsky. This car is amazing, and 
definitely worth looking into !!!!!!!!"
volvo,c70,2002,Randy Miller, 08/03/2002,On my second,4,"This is my second C70 Conv. in 3 
years.  I almost bought a 5-series 
BMW, however, I still wanted something 
a little different.  They don't make 
many C70 convertibles; and I still 
love getting thumbs-up as I drive 
around or the validating compliments 
from would be buyers.  The performance 
will not dazzle you, however, the car 
is just so damn fun to drive.  The 
build quality is exceptional and 
comfort is beyond comparison when 
matched-up to its competition."
volvo,c70,2002,PittPanther, 08/04/2002,Bought it only for its looks!,4,"This car is pure eye candy and we have 
had lots of people comment how 
beautiful and elegant the coupe is.  
The is more room for tall people than 
in any other luxury coupe.  However, 
given the still somewhat steep price 
tag the car offers suprisingly little 
features and doesn't ride and handle as 
well as many cheaper cars.  The power 
seats are a mere joke, the stereo in 
the center console an after-thought and 
I would advise anyone not to use the 
cup holders while driving - spillage 
guaranteed.  The T5 engine is so-so at 
low speeds and only comes alive when 
revved real hard.  Parking the car is a 
chore in tight spaces.
Bottom line: buy it for its looks."

say that I agree that the cup holders 
are flimsy, the back seat entry is 
awkward, and the turning radius too 
large, but that does not detract in any 
way from the incredibly exhilarating 
feeling one gets when driving this 
car!  It is fast, fun, easy to drive, 
comfortable and has a great stereo.  No 
problems thus far (knock on wood)and 
great dealer service.  Roadside 
assistance used once (for a flat tire) 
with great results.  Also,you don't see 
them everywhere.  And fits four easily!"

The windows rattle, the top flaps in the wind, the turning radius is almost unsafe, and twice my brakes have malfunctioned and needed major repair - with only 25K mileage.  Good looking is the only good thing I can say about his car."

found one !!  21 times in the 1st 2 
years - the sad part is that Volvo 
refused to take it back - it would have 
been in their best interest - they 
wouldn't be getting reviews like this 
one.  If anything could go wrong - it 
did !!  But we have low milage and the 
lease is almost over.  They agreed that 
they were having a lot of electrical 
problems with that model - tops not 
working, lights not working, windows 
not working - that's why they have 
discontinued this model - so they say.

volvo,c70,2002,F T Riekhof, 11/26/2007,2002 Volvo C70,3,"The car has numerous rattles and squeaks. It needed a complete replacement of the radiator and transmission cooler at 42,000 miles. The turning radius is way to wide and one would hardly know it has power steering. Gear indicator on dash is totally inadequate and stupid. The driver's seat has worn unacceptably given the milage. It has poor visibility when backing up. On the bright side: it handles wonderfully on the open road, and it is fun to drive with the top down in town. Overall it is a poor value, and I likely will never buy another Volvo as a result of owning this car."
volvo,c70,2002,Raymond Wylie, 06/17/2003,Who'd a thought a Volvo,4,"I told my wife to look for her dream 
convertible, thinking she would go for 
a BMW.  I was out of town and she 
called and said she found a beautiful 
white C70. This is the most beautiful 
car, in my opinion, on the market. I 
can't say enough about the comfort, 
handling, power and top down fun. Just 
a few bugs.  Battery went completely 
dead while in the garage after a few 
months. The radio/CD failed and had to 
be replaced. The tires are low profile-
high performance and tend to start 
cupping.  Rotate often and have an    
alignment performed often. Service is 
first class. Never had a problem. "

First off, they are only summer and second, the sidewalls are way too weak. You hit a pothole or bump and they are ruined. I switch over to Dunlop Wintersport M3. They also come run- flat. Take much more abuse (regulars), but low - profile in general is a bad idea. Car was totally fine in snow with the Dunlops (they are winter tires). Moondust color is perfect for hiding dirt, finish is fine, interior is perfect. No problems with anything, just get in and turn the key. Very unique. Drive all day and maybe see one other on the road. Can't think of anything else I would rather have."

I have had my Moondust C70 with the 
high powered turbo for 6 months and 
6,000 miles. So far, it has been a 
fantastic car. It is powerful (252 HP), 
smooth riding and the seats are 
extremely comfortable. I originally 
struck out to find a used one, but it 
was so difficult, I bought a leftover 
2003 new. People come up to me at 
stoplights to ask what it is and say 
how much they like it (sometimes one 
person a day) when the top is down! If 
you have the $, it is either this, or I 
would check out the new Saab (was not 
out when I got mine)."

The only weird thing that happens is sometimes the windshield wipers stop without being all the way down while cleaning. Top is showing some mild discoloration on the flex spots, but I also use the top as much as possible (any day over 60 degrees) in New England. Car is superb on the highway. Cruises at any speed with control. Highly recommended as a used car (providing no accidents, etc). You get a huge discount off of new, yet car is 90% the same if well taken care of. Would buy again.

The main thing to watch out for is the transmission!!!
At 90,000 miles it began to slip and by 120,000 I had to have it rebuilt to the tune of $3500.
Since having this work done I've not had any additional issues but was sorely disappointed in this Volvo as I've owned 6 and this one just pooped out.


Another thing to watch is to never drive up too close to a parking curb!!!
The bumper is so flexible and low to the ground as to let the car easily run up.
Due to the shape it will literally rip off when you back up.
This has happened to me 2x and I swear I'm not being as stupid as this sounds."

Only problems: slow acceleration up slight grades sometimes causes the tranny to slip a bit between 2nd and 3rd. No slip at heavier acceleration though. Also, get verbal abuse about the headlight wipers:Could do without them. Actually room under the hood to work on a few things myself. Only other nitpick is the slow power seat feature to enter the back seat."
volvo,c70,2004,h covington, 03/24/2016,4th c70,3,"this is my 2nd ragtop,and I am here to tell the whole truth...these cars can have their quirks,but are full of character.they rattle,aren't the smoothest riding around town,and can be noisy,not to mention,the leather can be high maintenance,and the top can leak around the a-pillars.to replace just the top,is between 1500-2500,for example,but other parts can be found pretty cheap on ebay.

The 2002 had a ""bad"" rattle in the back right 1/4 panel and after Volvo could not fix it I traded it in for the 2004. both cars ran well and I love the HT and the mileage is equal to the LT.  We get compliments daily and I drive the car 12 months in New England.  don't like the CD changer or the difficult method to move the seats up to let a person in the back.  Great ""empty nester car"" and long trips are like sitting in a lounge chair at home. "

other noises while driving. However, I 
had other problems beside the noises.

work. Battery dead two days after I 
took the car home. Dealership dinged

reviews here made me cautious. Also

out on uniqueness, size(big rear

Well worth it to get the Touring pkg 
(wood upgrades) and added cost wood 
wheel. Skip extra cost audio and 
Propus wheels(2x$1000)and the LPT 
comes in under $40K if you negotiate.

very good price on the car. The dealer 
had much more room to negotiate than 
either Saab or BMW which were my other 
two choices. Of all the convertables we 
looked at only BMW was a better car and 
at way too much more money. The BMW 
ended up costing about $8500 more."

get used to the visibilty and learn how 
to best use your mirrors but backing 
out of a parking space with an SUV on 
either side of you is taking your life 
in your hands.  You just go very slow 
and hope if someone is coming they will 
see you and stop.   As for reliabilty - 
I have had to take it in only once in 
the time I have owned it, vacuum leak 
in the brakes.  Other than that it runs 
like a top. "

Volvo has also taken care of adding 
numerous safety gadgets to make this a 
fun and safe car to drive. After test-
driving all of its competition I found 
it to be the best value all-around.  If

with our Volvo C70 and the Dealer.  The 
car is very difficult to drive due to 
all of the blindspots with the top up 
or down.  The front end is so low you 
can't go over the smallest bump w/o 
scraping it.  To get into the back seat 
takes forever due to auto seat speed.

Always looked great/unique, the 2 kids had lots of room in back. Smooth Georgia roads with turns brought out the best of this car. Interior comfort and quality were great (unlike some other's experience). Not a firm, sporty drive (like BMW and Audi A4) but a fine GT cruiser. Avg 23 mpg in mixed driving, 28 on highway. Extended warranty if you're buying used may be required w/reference to other's mech problems. I would stay away if you live in a city with rough roads. If you can find one used at low-mid 20's it should still be worth 15K in 3 more years. Good fun for not much coin!"

Toyota 4Runner or a Volvo XC90 but

C70.  It am so delighted I purchased

handling is just what was needed to 
allow me to again enjoy the open air

topless.  The road performance and gas 
mileage for the car is a pleasant 
suprise.  I live outside of town and

50MPH, especially in the morning when 
it's cold.  As it warms up shakes 
lighten up a little bit.  
Backing up with top up has a visual 
problem as there are no ""portholes"" in 
the canvas top and therefore visibility 
is blocked when backing up and trying 
to see, mostly to the right side 
approaching cars as well as blind spot 
just to see what is behind you.  
Electronic access to rear seat is slow

manual seat backs that go forward."

dream to drive. My trip to work seems 
cut in half. Handling is perfect 
for normal driving and more than any 
adult would need. Rear window is 
smaller than a Sebring, which does not 
have an auto-boot, but larger than the 
Saab. Not the acceleration of the BMW,

the gas? Love the solid sound when I 
close the door. Will last 20 years,

well with Mercedes CLK and BMW 328

issues you would not expect from a 
luxury car, such as noise from the 
wheels when you turn the steering wheel 
all the way, a very slight rattle in 
the dashboard, & sometimes a squeak 
when window goes up. At low speeds when 
you first start the car up there is a 
slight vibration. With Volvo you don't 
get the bells & whistles that you do 
with a Jap or German car, but the 
bottom line is I love my C70."
volvo,c70,2004,Mardi, 06/11/2005,Mardi's C-70 HPT,4,"C-70HPT offers a fun drive in a comfortable 4-passenger vehicle. I agree with a review I read, that it has a tendency to torque steer when you REALLY rip on it, but you quickly learn to accomodate. The UP side is that when you shower down, it responds admirably. I traded to it from a BMW Roadster and even though my C-70 isn't quite as much fun, it's a superior road car. My husband says, it offers a very civilized convertible experience especially with the optional wind screen.  Internal noise is minimal with the top up or down allowing you to enjoy the awesome optional stereo system. 17"" allow wheels and low profile tires are sleek, but the soft wheels damage easily and the trunk is small."

I doesn't take bumps in the road very 
well and I have to be very careful of 
potholes in the road. Otherwise, I 
love the ride!"
volvo,c70,2004,Cinnywoo, 07/13/2004,Love this car!,5,"Took delivery on this car in November 
of 2003, it has been great ever 
since.  I've had no problems with the 
performance.  Like many others I would 
like the rear seat access to be 
quicker and better view out of the 
back.  Otherwise, very happy with the 
car, including my 6'1 husband who 
NEVER was able to get in the back seat 
of the Celica.  I'm also happy knowing 
I'm in one of the safest cars around."
volvo,c70,2004,Lfront, 07/13/2004,Excellent car,4,"This is an excellent vehicle, one that 
is fun to drive, very comfortable 
seating, ample room in back seat, draws 
many favorable comments.  It is the 
only one in the area that we live in 
and gets many looks and comments.  The 
front seats are the most comfortable of 
any car that we've ever owned.  If 
there is a drawback, it's that the car 
must be in park and emergency brake on 
to raise or lower the top, (which is 
quite fast to do)."

Until I happened to see the 2004 C70 HPT let’s just say I’m in love this car has so much power and I found this one with only 56,000 miles on it. Volvo out done there self with this one. Love it !!!!

volvo,c70,2006,"""Tired"" Out", 09/06/2009,Suspension and tire woes,4,"Wonderful to look at, and fun to drive, but a disaster on tire wear. Dealer states that suspension is designed for high speed driving, so tire wear will be an issue. Originals wore out at 14000, and this set will be about the same. Dealer suggests going with H rated tires for better wear, but they aren't authorized to put them on. I'm thinking a trade is in the near future. Hate to do it, because I love the car, but $1000 + for tires every 14000 miles is no good. Local tire dealer says the suspension system (camber) is not adjustable, so Im stuck. Beware and watch for tire cupping."
volvo,c70,2006,chris292, 09/26/2011,Never again,3,"I have had this car for 5 years and it has 104k miles.

First off, tires.
This thing eats them.
The best we've done is 20k miles, the worst was 10k.
I've put 6 sets on it, and we have them rotated and realigned every 4k miles.

Brakes.
These have been replaced 4 times so far.

Other replacements include the nav (twice), alternator, motor mounts, suspension (entire thing) and several ""fixes"" to the top.
The car is driven on regular public roads and we go slow over speed bumps.


The seats have twice now decided to move backwards on their own while I was getting stuff out of the back seat.
On both occasions I was stuck and had to have help to get out."
volvo,c70,2006,Steve, 06/03/2006,A Convertible For Adults,4,"If top-down driving inspires you but safety, build quality and seating for 4 motivate you, then this is your convertible.  A head-turner with the top up or down, the converting process is guaranteed to stop traffic.  Actual adults can fit in the rear seat, and if you drive like an adult (i.e. - don't need to prove your manhood by speeding, snaking through traffic or excessive horsepower) the C70 will keep you smiling for years to come. "
volvo,c70,2006,Bay area gal, 07/23/2010,Tire issues are a problem,3,"Told first set of tires were just bad tires and replaced at 20 k miles due to excessive cupping. Within 10 k miles back tires cupping again  dealer monitored and replaced back tires only after stating they fixed the issue. Volvo would not replace front tires. Told tires on front had at least 20k miles at least on them with plenty of wear left. 3 months after replacing the back, cupping noise back. Dealer stated they did in fact hear and see cupping starting again. Did alignment and asked me to bring back for check in 5k miles. Waited 3k miles 2 months and was just told back tires are fine, no cupping which is discrepancy from 3 months ago and told front tires need replaced. Incredible "
volvo,c70,2006,Jerry, 07/06/2006,Slacks to shorts with a push of a button,5,"The summer days in Northern California are perfect for top-down driving in the mornings and evenings.  The coupe incarnation of the C70 is quiet and comfortable and you do forget that the car is also a convertible.  This car is indeed roomy enough for four adults and by packing light we were able to accommodate overnight luggage for four in the reduced trunk space of the convertable mode.  The three-piece retractable roof is definitely an eye- popping piece of engineering.  The C70 is fun to drive and fun for passengers.  Two favorite moments were driving top-down over the Golden Gate Bridge with friends, and taking a quiet evening drive along the Silverado Trail of the Napa Valley."

Car was a huge upgrade from my previous commuter (2006 Chevy HHR). Talk about a major head turner of a car. Bright red, black leather w/chrome accents , 6 speed manual. Car is absolutely gorgeous in design and a blast to drive! People have stopped me at gas stations asking me what is that car and where did I get it.Had several issues with coolant leaking from underneath the engine but turned out it was old worn out radiator hoses. Simple fix. As of 6/23/2020, I Have driven it 37k miles with car now sitting at 184k no other issues otherwise. My 1st Volvo and will certainly will not be my last.

Leaks, stereo speaker rattles, and in three times for airbag indicators coming on.  Add to that the tires wearing out completely after less than 10k miles with no assistance from volvo and I'm not a happy camper. Tires cost $1200 to replace at under 10k miles. "
volvo,c70,2006,whichhardtop, 07/20/2006,Worth the wait,4,"I fell into my 2006 C70 when a higher up in the Volvo company turned in his red C70 after putting 700 miles playing around with it for a few months.  The question is, after driving this car, why would anyone give it up?  The biggest knock on this car is that it is not fun to drive.  Try the standard 6-speed manual and watch it put the 218 horseys to work (and save $1250).  Also forget about spending $1400 on leather seating and go with the amazingly sleek (and not very hot) synthetic flextech upholstery.  I had no regrets about dropping $1550 on the 12-speaker dynaudio system, which sounds phenomenal.  My other big splurge was the 18"" tires, which firmly place this as a bonafide sportscar."

It is the most amazing convertible i have seen and the best part, it will get you a lot of attention. It drives great with top up or top down and looks great both ways also. I had looked at other convertibles in its class, but i am so glad i picked this one. This has so much more to offer."

volvo,c70,2006,Bob S, 12/31/2006,Poor introducton of model,3,"My ownership experience has been less than satisfactory due to the constant irritation of having the auto at the dealership. Constant problems with programming with radio shutdown, GPS shutdown, barking dog in the fan control of AC were finally fixed with a programming fix. Two rings embedded in the back boot of the convertible cover resulted in boot being replaced after two attempts to get replacement from mfg. Blew out a tire & since no spare, took 5 days to get a replacement. Now I get a recall stating most of the problems I have already experienced. Found five shims in trunk that fell from someplace in convertible top & undetermined where they should be replaced. "
volvo,c70,2006,Jeff, 10/30/2007,Check your rims,4,"We love the C70 but it has been in the shop a number of times due to the top's sensor going off while driving in the rain and when someone is walking behind the car as I back out of a parking space.  Basically I have to reset the top by opening and closing it.  Not a fun experience in the rain.  Another ongoing issue is both right rims seemed to have gone oval for no reason. One rim was even cracked on the interior.  The dealership and Volvo USA say they are not responsible.   The top rattles, water gets in at the car wash.  The battery died which unlocks the car and rolls down the windows. It's a safety feature."

It has been in the shop for 30 days for to get the roof to stop leaking, and to fix look at the electronic roof system since on it stops for no reason during closing.  It only closes half way and then stops. After thirty days, the issues are still not fixed.  In addition, we have had issues with the stereo system and the passenger airbag...

The interior is simple and nicely done. We have a Saab 9-3 convertible in the family. It is a nice car but will not hold its own against this Volvo. Quite a car!
volvo,c70,2006,laxdad, 06/10/2006,2 cars in one.,4,"This is a solid car, the hard top convertible makes the car a perfect choice for year round driving. The car is very quiet with the top up, and a blast to drive with the top down. The interior styling is excellent - no clutter and controls are easy to use. Front seats are typical Volvo comfort, and back seat room is larger than I have seen on other convertibles. Build quality is excellent."

The roof/windows leak during washing.  Both driver and passenger seats have 3 settings which is great, but I don't like that you have to hold the button vs. ""one touch"".  It is very fun to drive and handles great.  I have heard complaints about the navigation system, but I think it is much better than others I have used (including Lexus and BMW).  I love the remote control feature with the navigation.  With this said...  it is a great car and a lot of fun!"
volvo,c70,2006,David Murphy, 10/10/2006,"Great car, but noisy?",4,"Love the C70-design,ride comfort, power. Agree that displays could be better. Mine however seems to be a noisy car. Maybe because I have not had a convertible in a long time. Heavy sounding rattles have been hard to isolate. Dealer replaced bearings on the struts. Recently seems to be noisy at the roof connections. Would not give it up but am a little disappointed at the noise."

I am a life time Volvo owner with almost 2 million miles on them. That said, I am a very open minded critic of all vehicles.
I have never had a new, off the showroom floor, Volvo. I have also never had a lemon Volvo. I maintain my vehicles well and correct issues before they become problems. I feel the C70 hardtop convertible, is very good on the eyes - I receive a lot of looks. For my type of driving it has all the performance and handling I want. Although seven years old, this C70 looks showroom new, which says something about the quality of the material and build.  UPDATE 10-8-16: I have now sold this vehicle and purchased a 2013 Volvo XC70.  At about 50,000 miles the C70  started having issues with the electronic system controls, both with the engine and transmission. Warning would come on when nothing was wrong. Shops could not find anything wrong either. So due to these issues I decided to part with this beautiful Volvo.

volvo,c70,2007,FLRabbit, 07/26/2010,Not worth the money,2,"This car has been a maintenance nightmare.  I've had to fix things on this car I've never had to think about on any other car, and parts and labor are a fortune.  Volvo closed the dealership where I bought it so now I have to drive an hour each way to get service.  Not that they care, because you often have to keep going back before they admit to or find the problem.   This car is fun to drive when it's in shape, but unfortunately that's almost never.  It goes through tires like a big dog goes through bones.  You get weird little rattles and shimmies everywhere (that Volvo will blame on road conditions) and random things breaking that cost hundreds of dollars to fix. Not worth it at all."

I love the handling, love the interior space - one of the best convertibles on the market still today ,I have 14 year old daughter and put a child seat for my 2 year old son easily , the trunk is big enough to put a big stroller and more staff and you can still open the roof without any problem!!

Overall, I average about 21-22mpg in mixed driving, which is not great, but for a heavy turbocharged car with wide tires, it's not bad. The top takes longer to retract/raise than other convertibles, but there is none that looks nearly as good while doing it. Plenty of power out of just 2.5 liter, gobs of torque so minimal downshifting even in mountains. Premium package included Dynaudio stereo, which has extraordinary fidelity at all volume levels. "

The car is sophisticated but subtle, not drawing unwanted attention and does not scream ""mid-life crisis"" but is instead a good balance of fun, fashion, performance, practicality, and pride.  The engine has plenty of pickup, and the leather interior is luxurious and first-class.  All in all, a great car and a real keeper for this enthusiastic owner!"

One came in a mislabeled carton, it took an additional week until the right part came from Sweden. A week later, the roof and trunk stuck half way open necessitating an emergency tow and more shop time! Apparently few techs are trained to work on the C70. Volvo is not supporting this car with parts inventory/tech training. Some customer service reps were surprisingly rude. Not what you'd expect from Volvo, a disappointment."

This car offers the above with the best audio quality of any car I've experienced. The 6 speed manual with use of 87 octane gets me 21mpg between by highway and city driving. I would probably get better mileage with the suggested 93 octane. That is decent considering the car is built solid and the engine is 2.5L turbo. My only 2 complaints is the driver's left side elbow rest is uncomfortable during long rides. Second I continue to experience small issues with the convertible top software.

I also find the brake pedal to close to the gas pedal, I constantly bump it when moving my foot to the gas pedal.  This car is definitely worth the money that I paid for it.  I bought the flint gray with off black interior, the combination really looks great.

Great styling and design, great build quality, and zero initial problems.  Sure the engine power is not earth- shaking, but it's plenty adequate.  The car handles well, brakes well, looks great, and has lots of distinctive touches.  Retractable top is great, the Dynaudio sound is top-of-the-line, and you won't see yourself coming and going, due to the limited volume being built.  It truly is two cars in one, and looks as good with the top up as down.  It's not an all-out sports car, but rather it's a heck of a stylish, fun, top up/down touring car.  That said, it won't be embarrassed in the twisties. Oh yeah - it's safe, too."

volvo,c70,2007,ADM, 05/07/2007,Volvo C70,5,This is my second Volvo C70. I really enjoy the hardtop and the Dynaudio system. I have had to bring the car back to the dealer numerous times for the same two issues. The front windows were not going all the way up when the doors closed. It took five tries before they fixed this issue. The other issue is the full spare tire. Every time I hit a bump of any type in the road the tires rattles around in the trunk. Volvo has looked at this issue at least 5 times and still can't figure out a way to stop it. They are looking into a foam base for it to sit on. They believe it might be a recall issue down the road.
volvo,c70,2007,GB, 06/04/2007,Volvo C70,4,I have only had the vehicle for 7 weeks however I am very satisfied with the performance of the vehicle.  The only downside thus far is the gas mileage. I have only been getting about 18 MPG in the city.
volvo,c70,2007,tim2it, 07/30/2007,Volvo C70 first two thousand miles,4,"Got one of those 6000 imported C70 2007 babies, and I'm really enjoying it. It is Magic Blue Pearl with white interior. Best, most intuitive interior I have ever owned. I think it is called ergonomics. I also get people stopping me all the time to admire the car. Auto trans is a lagger at the light, but acceptable for people who don't care to shift.  There is a pull to the right during accelerated lane changes at higher speeds, but again, it is OK if you know it is part of the turbo right twist phenom. I took it to Yosemite and over 9,000 feet mountain passes and the car was fantastic. Overall, it is a great ride, and a nice, safe drive. Let's hope I can get parts as it ages. "
volvo,c70,2007,Sharon Lewis, 05/22/2007,Lemon?,2,"I have had nothing but trouble with this car.  It began at about 3,000 miles with a new fuel injector, gas tank & line, then moved on to strange noises upon starting, broken button on seat, first the passenger window quit working, now the driver window won't stay closed.  I have had it in the shop 5 times for 8 problems.  I am in the process of trying to sell them back this car."
volvo,c70,2007,David Assegi, 08/16/2007,Volvo C70 - one owner experience,4,"More fun in a Volvo than one could imagine. It is different too. Swedish cool that turns heads without being ostentatious. There are dozens of BMWs out there. So if you want something that does pretty much exactly the same thing, but isn't ""me too"", go for the C70."
volvo,c70,2007,Laurence Lloyd, 11/30/2016,Great combo of beauty and pizzaz.,5,"Don't expect to put adults in the rear unless they are little people. Handles very nicely and has adequate engine power with nice mileage level, especially on highway.

volvo,c70,2007,Doug Caldwell, 08/06/2008,What a great car!,5,"Bought our C70 through the Overseas Delivery Program. You get 2 round trip tickets to Europe (anywhere, anytime, even peak season!), a night at the best hotel in Gothenburg, a free tank of gas (worth about $170!), insurance while you are there, a nice tour and lunch, and of course the car is shipped back. We took the all night ferry to Kiel-a beautiful trip thru the fjords. Ask to book the ferry at the factory, and you get a Volvo discount. We drove thru Germany, France and Belgium then up to Amsterdam, about 2000 mi. The car turned heads everywhere, it gets good mileage and is a practical extravagance.  Buy a portable nav with European maps in the US before you go- we didn't, and wish we had"

volvo,c70,2007,doubletap, 09/28/2006,06' Black on Black C70,4,"It's my wife's car, but I get to play with it on weekends. Wow what a car, for the price we paid it's worth it. We have a 97 Maxima which has great acceleration, but the C70 takes off like a bat out of hell. The feel is great, have to watch from ending up in someones rearend. The car surprises you as you press on the gas. The car seems to be therapeutic, just get in the car and start driving, and you feel the problems just get left behind. The car is so enjoyable to drive.    "
volvo,c70,2007,WIlliam, 09/11/2006,Great Car!!!!,4,This is a really great car to have!! I did  however have a problem with the wiring in the retracting of my top.  But overall a really fun and superb car to have. A 10++++ in the WOW factor.
volvo,c70,2007,Ozefan, 01/13/2007,I love my new C70!,4,"The four months that it took for my C70 to arrive from Sweden were well worth it! I've had the car for just over two months now and I absolutely love it. I have the manual, 6-speed. It handles extremely well, and is especially fun on curvy country roads. People stop and watch as the top goes up or down. Fuel economy is better than I expected. It's very comfortable - the bucket seat supports your back and a long road trip is conducted with ease and comfort. And there is genuine room for 2 passengers in the rear seats. Adequate trunk space."
volvo,c70,2007,Morgen, 05/14/2008,Best convertible yet,4,"I saw my C70 being built in June of 2006 in Udevalla Sweden and took overseas delivery of it in September. It is loaded with the nav system and the premium sound system. The car has been flawless in performance. The car continues to draw appreciative remarks from people, especially when I put the top down or up. I still have the manufacturer's plates on the front of the car. Look forward to purchasing another Volvo in 2010."
volvo,c70,2008,djfunkywill, 03/13/2015,Nice features but awkward interior,3,"I replaced my Toyota Solara convertible with this Volvo C70.  Despite similar horsepower, the Volvo seems to have quite a bit less pep.  I bought this car because it is nice looking and Volvo's reputation for safety and longevity.  Now that I've settled into the car, I've noticed that the interior is much smaller than my previous car.  I'm an average size male and I've got my seat quite far back.  Even this seat setting, I notice that my knuckles bump my leg when I make a turn.  I couldn't imagine transporting anyone other than a child in the rear.  It seems cramped on the inside but I hope to get used to it."
volvo,c70,2008,4mercoachrick, 10/10/2011,"Liked it so much, I bought another!",4,"We enjoyed our '08 C70 so much, we just purchased the slightly updated 2011 model.
We kept the '08 for 3 1/2 years and just under 30K miles.
It was never in the shop for anything other than scheduled maintenance and one warped brake rotor.
The key-fob seat memory was a little balky...more of a nuisance than anything.
Our avg mpg was 23ish for the total period, highway mileage was closer to 30 when we were trying to 'watch' it.
After owning the '04 ragtop version of the C70, the '08 was superior in almost every way.
Very solid with the top up or down...no problems with the top or its operation.
The FWD can get a little 'slippy' if the driver sends too much power on slick roads, FYI."
volvo,c70,2008,fordmustang_27, 02/19/2012,Fun Pleasureable and reliable,4,"I bought this car used in march 2011. It came with 19,000 miles that woman put on before me. She traded it in and bought a new one. I compared this to the camaro, bmw and infiniti convertibles. These cars could not compete with the value and the feel of this car. The hard top convertible is amazing to watch go up and down. It has surprisingly good power with its 230 hp with its 2.5 liter turbo 5 cylinder. Still gets good gas mileage. I average 22 city and 28 highway driving slow like i normaly do. But I want to pass someone its very easy. Im at 30k miles and had no problems. Very reliable. Only thing its expensive to maintain. Around 200-600 dollars every time i bring it in. "
volvo,c70,2008,Stephen, Atlanta,Volvo 4 Life in Atlanta,4,I always wanted a convertible but steered clear of soft tops - loved the old C70 but only would have purchased a hard top.  When I saw online Volvo building a new hardtop convertible I had to have it (though I also steer clear of new models their first year or two due to the manufacturer working out the bugs).  Having had two BMWs prior I struggled with not getting another one but am thrilled with my decision.  This car even got a round of applause at a local eatery when I put the top down for the drive home.  I also own an XC90 SUV - both cars are white so a neighbor asked me if I work for Volvo now.  I would highly recommend a Volvo!!
volvo,c70,2008,bruceko1, 08/10/2011,Never Again,3,"I purchased this car used with about 22k miles on it. It now has 36k miles.
It's been in the shop twice to fix a front wheel/hub issue that impacted braking function and a third time to replace A/C compressor.
A/C still doesn't work correctly and now check engine light is on.
I've owned 50 plus vehicles before this one. I've never had a vehicle that required so much time in the shop.
So 4 times in the shop in 14,000 miles.
Can't wait for the next 14.
I'll be dumping this pc of junk before the warranty expires."
volvo,c70,2008,cricket3, 08/23/2008,Not allowed to use a carwash,3,"The C70 is a beautiful car. The only problem that I have had is that I can't take my car through a car wash. It leaks inside my car. Now, this would not shock me too much if I had a cloth top. I have the hard top. I took it to the dealer 2 times and also reported it to corporate. After they tested my car, they agreed it did leak while in the car wash. There recommendation was that I can either hand wash my car or drive it to their dealership and take it through their light carwash. Would not mind if I didn't have to drive 25 minutes to get there and being that my car is leased, this would be extra miles which I prefer not to put on my car. Volvo does not stand by product. Sad!!"
volvo,c70,2008,Totally Frustrated, 10/11/2008,It's Not Truly Top Quality,4,"I love my C70, but it is not the quality product I expected. Since purchasing it new, I have attempted resolution of a leaking top and windows with no success. Thus far, they have replaced both rear side windows and all the seals. It continues to leak.  I only hand wash it with a mild stream of water from garden hose. The leaks persist. I am totally frustrated and am preparing to take this to the media. The local dealership and Volvo will not get my repeat business nor referral.  "
volvo,c70,2008,Dennis, 09/06/2007,New Toy,4,"I have only had this car a few weeks and it has exceeded my expectations,  Fun to drive, love the hard top convertible.  It won't mess your hair.  I upgraded the sound to the dyna system and I was literally blown away, I have owned BMWs, Audi and Acura. This is the most fun I have had. I hope I am as thrilled a year from now.  Only complaint is not enough accessory outlets, one for my gps and one for my cell. They have to share!"
volvo,c70,2008,Michelle, 04/06/2008,You can't believe how great this car is!,5,"This was the first vehicle I test drove when I started car shopping - after no less than 10 vehicles later I returned to buy this awesome car! A practical indulgence - a hardtop sedan when the weather is bad and a convertible when the sun is out. Mine is all but totally loaded with the exception of a navigation system & ultra-prem leather which seems nearly impossible to find - I couldn't be more thrilled. With 2 hours in daily commute time, the ride is luxurious and fun to the point I don't want to leave the vehicle. All I can say is that if you see one on a Volvo lot snap it up ASAP - you won't regret it! Safety, style and fun all rolled up into one great vehicle. "

volvo,c70,2008,Joel C. Hart, 06/05/2008,Best convertible I have had,5,Bought the car on the overseas purchase program. Saved 8% and got a free vacation. Volvo people in Sweden are great and we drove 900 miles while there. Six speed manual is a dream. Side warning system is great for blind spots. Plenty of pep with manual transmission good road stability and quiet with hard- top up. Dynasound a must for CD's and Ipod. Some understeer but mostly a good solid ride. 29MPG in Sweden but gas is 95 octane and $8.25 a gallon. Does well on mid grade in USA mileage on cruise control at 70MPH is 28MPG. City is about 26MPG. Very comfortable and smoth. My wife loves the car. We traded a 2004 BMW 325CI and I like this car better. So far so good. No mechanical problems
volvo,c70,2008,wendydan, 04/14/2009,VolvoC70,4,"My husband and I purchased the C70 after doing extensive research over the last year. We owned a soft top Sebring Convertible and loved it but were considering a retractable hard top. We bounced back and forth between the C70 and the S60 with a sunroof. We admired the Volvo C70 the first time we saw it while on vacation, but were not sure we wanted to pay the high dollar amount. The mechanics of the hard top were a concern and while it makes this car very heavy, the safety features are a huge plus. Although, after selling our Sebring and missing the convertible for a week, it was decided that the C70 would be the choice. This car is incredibly sleek, comfortable and tremendously fun. "
volvo,c70,2008,Randy, 06/16/2009,Troubled C70,3,"I chose the C70 over an Audi due to the hardtop.  I have had it in the shop seven times and 90 days since May '08 for roof issues.  Fortunately none of them have been major, but a major inconvenience on my time.  My biggest problem has been getting anyone from Volvo corporate to give me a call to discuss some kind of resolution."
volvo,c70,2008,Willy, 10/02/2009,Loving The Sun,4,"Overall, I love the car. Ride is smooth, power is more than adequate and handling is nimble.  The beefed up Dynaudio Sound System is expensive, but AWESOME! The design of the system lets you totally enjoy the stereo even with the top down. Just wish my model came with iPod Dock.  Interior is very comfortable and quiet, though not overly spacious. There's plenty to love here, with a few minor annoyances: no iDock, the trunk cowl (required to be snapped down before lowering the top) could seat more securely, some don't like the back massage given by the big subwoofers behind the back seats, BLIS trips out occasionally.  "
volvo,c70,2008,Jim, 07/30/2010,"Great car, best looking under $80K",4,"Looked at BMW convertible. BMW had better performance and name, but C70 has great (better) looks and fine handling for $10K less than BMW. Still get people to see what kind of car it is. Excellent safety/accident reports are a bonus. 49,000 miles with no problems."
volvo,c70,2008,Brian, 09/22/2010,Never Again,3,"I was never more excited to get behind of the wheel of this car.  It's sexy in black with a white interior.  Although the inside isn't much to write home about, the outside catches eyes.  That's about it. In 3 years, it's been in the shop countless times...broken AC, heat, another issue with the engine.  The top has malfunctioned 3 times in the last 2 months...twice in the last week alone. Not what I'd expect for the cost. Contacted corporate and they were nice to send out some rebate coupons if I wanted to buy more stuff from Volvo. yeah right.  It's looking the brakes need to be replaced too after only 28K miles.  I'd rather have a KIA"
volvo,c70,2008,Al, 10/23/2010,Dream Car,5,"We just purchased the car today and took it fir a long drive down Cutler Road in Miami what an sunny day and nice breeze off the bay.  We have not driven and enjoyed time together like that with my wife in a long time,  With the top down we felt we were sailing in time,  I want to Thank Phil at Deel Volvo for his patience and honesty they all made the process so simple and honest.  I will give you all an updates as the weeks pass,  "
volvo,c70,2008,Constantine, 03/25/2008,Best convertible for the money!,4,"After driving the competition the 2008 C70 was a no brainer. Lots of power, beautiful design in and out, the best seats ever (even by Volvo standards) and best of all I can have two car seats in the back (infant and forward facing) with lots of room to spare. I got the upgraded sound system which is amazing and worth every dollar, the climate package which keeps me warm in the morning and free Sirius radio for 6 months. What will amaze you is how big the trunk is with and without the roof in it, how smooth the transmission is  how elegant the interior is and how many storage compartments they put in this car. Bravo Volvo! "
volvo,c70,2008,Charles Williamson, 05/10/2018,Wonderful Fun Car,5,"It’s really a sports car which is a delight to drive, if not difficult to get in and out. But is a thrill to put down That hardtop and feel the wind in our hair. Having had a very serious accident (damage over $5,000), I can say this is a vehicle that saved our life. It is the safest car made.

volvo,c70,2008,Mike, 12/06/2007,Wow Wow Wee Wow,5,"This is a fun vehicle and very fun to drive!  What originally caught my eye was the sleeker design in contrast to the other Volvo models.  The hard top convertable is also an excellent plus!  Like Mc Donalds ""dah dup dah dah daaaaaah I'm lovin' it!"""
volvo,c70,2008,clt, 06/13/2010,First Volvo. Will be last Volvo.,3,"Seems to be one repair after the other. First was a top malfunction. Then speaker, trunk and suspension rattles which were not repaired first time and still have speaker noise. Now, problem with low beam lights so cannot drive at night. Feel like we got a lemon. At Volvo more than in home garage. Traded 1995 vehicle with no problems, for a Volvo with too many repairs needed, especially for the price paid. At this point I am afraid to travel to far from home in it. Have already started looking for another make to replace the c70 after this repair is completed. Sad thing is that I love the look and convertible, but, it's just not up to the ""old"" Volvo reputation."
volvo,c70,2008,"Paul ""E""", 02/16/2009,Great car almost perfect,4,I saw the car at the 2006 New York auto show and fell in love with it.  The lines on the car are beautiful with the top up or down. The ride is good and its quiet inside. The interior is a little on the plain side when compared to other luxury brands. The front wheel drive is great in order to cope with New York winters. I would not even consider a rear wheel drive car.
volvo,c70,2008,Thanks CostCo, 06/07/2008,Thanks Costco,4,"Just bought my C70 through the special deal Costco and Volvo have. Great deal on a fun to drive car. This car turns heads! Love the roof, the dynaudio and the back up warning since the rear view is somewhat limited. Has a decent sized trunk versus the Beemer 335 which a trunk the size of a shoe box. If you are a Costco member you can't go wrong on this one. I can't wipe the smile off my face."
volvo,c70,2008,Squashie, 08/07/2008,C-70 with Automatic,4,"Ok, I've looked at BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, and all other convertibles. This is the best blend of top down. Fun to drive, fuel economy, and good looks out there. I'm a rather large person, 6'5"", close to 300 lbs k, with rather large feet. I found the spacing on the manual 6 a little too close, but the auto 5 is great!  Besides, I don't drive F-1 so all of that shifting may, or may not be, necessary. The fit and finish are great. Love the seats, the lines and the admiration of others. (white car, light leather interior and tinted windows) Mid-life crisis with no direct link. Looked at a red one, but liked the white better. Could use possibly a more higher profile tire, Texas roads"
volvo,c70,2008,Jamie, 08/16/2008,Reflections,4,"Bought the car from the distribution center. Came to me with no squeaks, rattles, etc. Has so far been a flawless experience contrasted with my 2005 and 2002 CLK cabriolets, which were both problem-prone.  "
volvo,c70,2008,LovethisCar, 08/20/2008,Best convertible for the money,5,"I looked at all the convertibles. This car is $10,000 less than the BMW 335i but has much better safety,rear leg room, and I think exterior styling. The engine is smaller than the BMW but is more than adequate for driving anywhere but the autobaun. I have had strangers come up and ask me to put the top up or down. It turns heads in parking lots. This is pure fun and large enough to truly seat 4 people.I get 19-20 MPG around town."
volvo,c70,2008,LLoyd Smith, 10/19/2008,My C 70,4,"I test drove other cars in the same class; Audi convertible, Lexus, Mercedes, etc. None, I say none of them felt as solid, had the same pick up, were as stylish, comfortable or as beautiful. What an great experience to drive this car, AND it isn't bad to have so many people take an extra look as you drive by.  Everything is within very easy reach inside, even visibility is great. Although I prefer all wheel drive the C 70's front wheel drive works well. I have about 4,000 miles on it presently and I am getting an average of 20 mpg and I have a heavy foot.  I am an ""oldster"" and it is a pleasure to get that ""I love my car"" feeling back. Top up or down draws a crowd."
volvo,c70,2008,Mike S, 11/10/2008,Impressed with C70,5,"I could not be more satisfied with my new 2008 C70 convertible. As an owner of a 2000 C70, bought new and driven over 100k miles, I initially though I would select something different. I shopped the competition for convertibles and test drove many below and above the C70's price point.  I concluded the C70 was clearly the best value for me based on quality, style, and fuel efficiency. The C70 is not inexpensive, but the more expensive 328i and CLK350 could not justify  their higher prices. I have now driven the car for two months.  All my expectations have been satisfied. Great qulaity and value."
volvo,c70,2008,Daniels, CA,More HP,4,A little less sporty for a convertible. Would help to have more horse power. Bluetooth should be a 'must have' especially in CA.

Better looks, perfect sound system (please get the upgrade) and best of all has more airbags than I can count. The seats are very comfortable, the interior is nice and easy to use buttons, I also got the Climate package, 6 mo free Sirius, 1 year free maintenance and best of all $10K of the sticker price. All I need now is some sun. Enjoy your purchase."
volvo,c70,2008,Gilberto Rivera, 07/04/2009,Love this Car,4,"We've owned our Volvo C70 for 18 months and so far no problems.  Quality, build and fit is excellent.  Car rides a little harsh but that is due to the 18"" performance tires which wear out rather quickly ($300 a pop to replace).  We get a lot of positive comments on the sharp looks.  Have one major gripe.  That is, the navigation system is a real ""Dinosaur"" to operate.  The Japanese beat the Swedes in the electronic software department, again.  "
volvo,c70,2008,Sue, 07/08/2009,Fun but I wouldn't buy another one.,4,I just discovered that this car has no spare tire. I was never informed it was an option. Who ever heard of such a thing?  And Volvo is supposed to be so safety conscious.  The interior storage space is terrible.  Not even a road map fits in any of the side pockets.  Is a cell phone supposed to fit in that little well on the seat divider?  Whose? 
volvo,c70,2008,Rick, 05/02/2008,"Like it, but frustrating",4,"Did a lot of research on convertibles before I bought this one.  In general, I think it is a very functional and stylish car. Good driving position and room for the kids. I have had to take it to the dealer 4 times to get rid of the intermittent annoying rattle in the center front of roof and between the front and back right windows. Seems to be a very difficult thing to diagnose and fix.. Hopefully we are getting to the end of the issue. Once resolved, I will love the car. "
volvo,c70,2008,Mike, 05/23/2008,Ultimate convertible,5,"Looked at convertibles for 2 years before settling on the C-70. Decided on C-70 because of feel of quality and safety rating. Very well designed car. Smooth, quiet, excellent acceleration and handling. Gas mileage has been pretty good at 23 mpg in mixed driving. Optional bluetooth system worth the $675 dollars. I like the BLIS and Dynaudio."
volvo,c70,2008,Johnt, 10/28/2020,C70-A cool drop top.,5,"Not the best handling vehicle (doesn’t compare to beemers etc.)) but still a lot of fun to drive.  Enough pep & power when needed.  At 95K miles no major mechanical problems. I have owned it about ten years and I still. like it.

volvo,c70,2009,oak7, 03/12/2014,2009 Volvo C70 T5 Convertible,3,"This was my first review: ""I have had my C70 for two months. Most of that time the weather has been nasty - snow, cold, wet, with a few days of nice weather (Typical pre-spring in Alabama). So far I love it. Drives great, comfortable (54 miles one way commute) with plenty of power. Car has 110,000 miles and I have had to replace an axle and wheel bearing but it's good now. Awesome looks and very unique. Car has plenty of room inside and four adults have ridden comfortably, though getting in and out takes a bit of practice. Love my C70.""
I still love the car but not the reliability I guess. It has cost us over $2,000 on tires, front end and the rims being bent when hitting a pothole, etc.  When it runs it is good but when something ""breaks"" it is costly. Not sure I'd get another one based on our history with this one. Still loving the hard-top convertible.""
Since we've owned the car it has been a ""love/hate"" relationship. Love it when it's working, hate it when it is not. Car seems to have issues with front end. Replaced axles, rack and pinion and everything twice. Tires multiple times and it still has a popping noise when you brake or turn that hasn't been identified despite hours in the dealership, repair, etc. (taken it to various places because no one has an answer). I also have experienced ""battery drain,"" when I leave the car for a few days it won't crank. When the battery is dead the key is stuck in the ignition and you can't get it out. Easy to jump it and when you do the key comes out. Seems to be a security issue to me. Anyway, when it is running it is an awesome car. Great mileage, very comfortable and plenty of power. Turbo is there anytime you need it, for sure. But when it's broken, it is a pain in the a--.

volvo,c70,2009,Steve, 12/22/2009,Way behind the Technology,3,"The looks are great, inside and out. Ride is comfortable, especially the highway driving I do. Handling is a little mushy. The car is quiet as a hardtop, top up, not bad, top down. Seats are incredibly comfortable and definitely recommend the sovereign leather. Technology is embarrassing. The Navigation is like a built is Garmin. The phone is HORRID; very few phones are compatible, and any time I have tried to upgrade phone software, won't sync to the phone book. The other problems are the gas pedal is 1-2 inches lower than the brake pedal, which is awkward, and the Climate Control is weak. After 6 months, I'm going to see if I can trade it if I can do it without losing too much money"
volvo,c70,2009,Mark Lee, 07/16/2017,I love my C70,5,"Purchased 2009 used in 2013 with 33,000 miles with dealer warranty.  At 60,000 miles, have dealer replace both rubber axle booth - under dealer warranty.  At 70,000 miles, have dealer replaced the leaky coolant reservoir - under dealer warranty.  Other than these, no issue with the car for past 4 years.  C70 is very stylish and many people compliment the car.  One time I was approached by a lady on a red light - thought I was being carjacked, but she wanted to know what car I was driving.  Seats are very comfy and I feel like sitting in comfy sofa at Ikea store.  C70 came with one of the best stereo I ever witnessed. My previous Infiniti Q45 Bose system is sub-par to C70's.   The stereo sound great even with top down.  Bluetooth, however, need improvement.  Bluetooth phone Volume is very low (I have Samsung Note 4).   It has no A2DP option (for 2009 model) and when I asked around online, Bluetooth audio option is not available.   I use small thumb drive to play all my music.  It even taking 128gb thumb drive- thousands of songs!   Or you have option to plug in 3.5 jack via Aux.     There is no way you can install custom radio (not that I need one) since factory stereo also works as climate control display.    It's so much fund to drive during the California winter with top down (heated seat).  Top down during hot summer really make you enjoy the sun, but when I was driving Mojave and Las Vegas under 114 degree hot sun, I thought I was going to be roasted alive...        When top is up, I can hear some squeaky noise time to time, but if you don't pay attention, you can hardly hear them.  As with all front drive car, it has torque steering, but I have not experienced any under/over steering when cornering.    Break is bit soft compared to my wife's Toyota Sienna, but never failed the stopping distance as of now (I commute 60 miles on S. Calif 405 everyday, and I see accidents at least 4x a week).  Great cruising car with enough horses, but don't expect to hit 60 in 3.5 secs.  If I want performance super fast car, I would probably look for non convertible car.                          Good: Stereo, trunk space, 2 car in 1, hard top, turbo                         Bad: Wind deflector extra (bought mine from Ebay used $250, Bluetooth, No real spare tire for my C70 (has repair kit), heavy due to hard top.

Love the top fold- down, and the trunk space for a convertible.  Best feature: DynAudio stereo, great sound and bass. The car turns heads with the top is down.  Got 24K miles on the car and no problems. Two gripes: 1. Pirelli tires a (18 in. wheels) don't last beyond 30K miles (cost $300 a pop). 2. Navigation system stinks.  An address has to be manually entered.  No voice activated features (like my Honda). For a premium brand this is a surprise. "

I also own a 2002 Volvo S60.  I have always like the C70, but was concerned that I wouldn't really use it as a convertible, which would be a huge waste of money.  Worries are gone.  I can't keep the top up.  I should be arrested for indecent exposure!  This car is so much fun, handles well, is beautiful, and has great features.  The integrated Bluetooth is awesome and works well even with the top down on the highway.  Also love the integrated iPod.  The only drawback is the horrible gas mileage and small (compared to my S60)gas tank."
volvo,c70,2009,cthimes, 07/21/2009,It is fun to drive again,5,I just purchased this vehicle last week and love everything about it.  I am a big man and fit in the vehicle just fine.  It is a great car to show off and certainly gets everyone's attention when it changes.  My kids have named the car after Jazz in the Transformer movie because it really is a noticeable change.  I like the feeling of security that the car brings and I am very pleased with the performance.  The car has plenty of power actually more horsepower than the V6 Mustang convertible that I was also considering. It really is two cars built into one.
volvo,c70,2009,Shelly, 07/29/2009,Perfect Ladies Convertible,4,"While not up to the performance of a BMW, this car is smooth as silk.  Acceleration and handling in normal driving are very good.  The hardtop works amazingly well.  It is quiet with the top down.  You can actually listen to music with the top down at 70 MPH or have a conversation. The seats are supportive and comfortable even for my husband at 6'2"" and 230LBS.  The car looks great with the top up and fantastic with the top down.  No fooling around with a cloth top or boot.  Sound system is quite good and I just have the standard one.  I can listen to music with top down just fine. This is not a car for a sports car enthusiast, but for me going to the golf course and work it is just great."

volvo,c70,2009,seye, 08/27/2009,"bravo, Volvo",4,"Purchased my black C70 in August.  My initial impressions are great.  I wasn't expecting Vette performance, so acceleration/ handling are adequate. No shudders/creeks in the body top up or down.  Exterior design is beautiful-  by far the most attractive Volvo.  Interior also designed well-- drivers seat is comfortable and very adjustable.  Chose standard sound system and I am pleasantly suprised by the acoustics.  Both the iPod and Bluetooth interface are awesome.  Some of the interior bits and surfaces could be of a higher quality (dash, wheel, door trim).  The key is cumbersome, and I wish I'd opted for keyless with this car.  Overall, I love the versatility and design."
volvo,c70,2009,miabchdave, 04/19/2010,This Car Relaxes Me,4,"This car will make you want to cruise, listen to good music, and enjoy the scenery.  I find it very comfy.  The trunk room and rear seats have no other competition in the hard top convertible space.  The interior storage is definitely adequate. Those three main reasons are why I went with the C70 over the BMW 328i hardtop even though the lease on the BMW worked out to be $10 cheaper a month.  It's simply a more 'usable' car... it's even rated to tow!  The car does have some oddities that need to be addressed, though.  See below. "
volvo,c70,2009,houston, 08/18/2009,first full month of ownership,4,C70 is a beautiful car that exceeds my expectation of how livable a convertible can be.  The folding top is a marvel to see in operation and the interior is Scandinavian simplistic.  This car speaks of adult sophistication.
volvo,c70,2009,Fin, 03/11/2009,Fun convertible,4,"Smooth as silk when shifting this manual 6 speed. Excellent interior headroom, not a claustrophobic feeling like some front windshields give you in convertibles. The hardtop splits into three pieces which still allows for excellent storage in the boot."
volvo,c70,2009,Magic BlueOne, 02/01/2010,Beautiful Car Inside and Out,4,"First off, I enjoy just looking at my C70, it is a beautiful car. Its handling, breaking and acceleration are all capable, so for my intended purpose of top down cruising it is a pleasure. For the reality as a daily driven commuter work horse the Northeast its proved both comfortable and reliable, and the hard top is a necessity. Its a sedan when I need it, a convertible when I want it. Nice job Volvo."
volvo,c70,2009,PJ, 05/30/2009,Professional Convertible,4,"As a VW driver for years, I talked myself out of another VW when my last lease expired. I do like my C70 and find it stylish, but I miss the zip of my 4cylinder turbo charged VW Passat.I test drove an Eos in my search for a new car, and bowed out due to unsteady feeling of that car.

volvo,c70,2009,Ken, 03/31/2009,A blast to drive!,5,"Smooth handling and head-turning style go hand-in-hand in my 2009 Volvo C70. On a recent trip to Southern California, the C70 averaged 32.6 mpg. The car has plenty of low end acceleration and if one is not careful, it can creep up to 75-80 (or faster) mph very quickly. Interior styling, while conservative, is ergonomically sound. When the metal top is lowered, people stand and stare as the jigsaw puzzle neatly tucks into the trunk. For a convertible, the C70 does not disappoint in adequate trunk space. I carted two full sized reptile tanks and two pieces of luggage with no difficulty. Compared to an Audi A4 or BMW 3 series (both more expensive), the C70 holds its own very nicely!"
volvo,c70,2009,Pete, 04/29/2009,Unique and Beautiful,4,"   Excellent exterior and interior styling; interior is understated and straightforward with intuitive controls.  Trunk and backseat are both surprisingly roomy (best in class) for a retractable hardtop.  Roof function is smooth and quick.    Low-end torque is a little weak, but the turbo makes for a zippy little passer once it is underway.  Fuel economy is great.  This car is a well- kept secret, making it pretty unique.  "

The turbo has a nice punch and you can pick up speed pretty well, but I don't think I will be drag racing this car.

With the top down, this Volvo is really quiet, even at highway speeds. The wind is controlled with the windscreen and the car is really an exciting ride. I have had the car for over a month now and feel the build quality is solid, so far no rattles or noises from the roof. The space in the trunk is great, even with the top down and 4 ""adults"" can ride in comfort. Overall, I am really happy with my purchase and would recommend this convertible for anyone looking for a spacious, fast, comfortable hardtop convertible. "
volvo,c70,2010,doctom, 08/25/2010,10 months into ownership,4,"Quite a nice piece of work. It combines so many exceptional features. First off is the exterior design. Neatly sculpted and quite fashionable. Easy on the eyes and will draw a lot of envious stares whether the top is up or down. Most naturally I prefer the top down. Makes getting to and from work a delight and not a chore. While not the top dog in the horsepower race, it won't disappoint either. Particularly when you want to pass. It accomplishes that in convincing style. I have not to experienced the safety/crash features and hope I never do. Knowing that they are there is reassuring. Fuel economy is quite acceptable. Not having to use premium gas a real plus. I really like this car!"

Road and wind noise are minimal at top-up speeds up to 85 mph and top-down up to 65 mph.
I average 21 mpg at 25 mph and 26 mpg at 65 mph.

I maintained as instructed - however, the first issue appeared shortly after 30k,  ac blew hot air on one side - dealer said they fixed, under warranty - no problem. same problem again just a few thousand miles later - dealer fixed again, no problem. then - 10K later, same issue - dealer fixed again, with the assurance ""they fixed for good this time"". starting to get annoyed.  during that time, tires only got 30k - had to be replaced, dealer said thats normal for this vehicle. also had a check engine lite issue, which the dealer fixed, along with a few other annoying issues. took it in for the ""final"" warranty repair/maint at 60K.  It looks ""great"" they tell me....   bring it back in at 67K,  out of warranty....   repair bill 4K - I asked, all this happened in the last 7k miles?   yep they say, nothing covered, shocks, struts, motor mounts etc....   Oh - and by the way, the AC blows hot again! - 1400 to repair,  I threw a fit - wrote a letter to volvo, they sent me back a check for 1200....   since then, replaced another motor mount,  transmission mount, some oil sensor and housing that was leaking, cv boots and joints, front axles   all in all, 7400$ ALL SINCE THAT 60 K CHECKUP (I now have 90k miles on it)  replaced the headlamps twice, and now the driver side doesn't work at all - even after replacing the bulbs....    too bad, I love the look of the car, but no more volvos for me....   UPDATE  - since the last review at 90K I have dumped another 4K into the car - just not worth buying another volvo...   since 60K miles and total ownership cost well over 12K when you include regular maintenance....

No-one has ever said the RDAR makes the computer search for a signal day and night so if you don't start your car often the battery will discharge. RDAR is a service you can Buy form Volvo if you Buy it problem solved. Enjoy the monthly payment on that!  There was or is a lawsuit about this, see google. No-one at a dealership will admit or they are so ignorant about their vehicles you can't get a straight answer.  If your windows stop going up and down automatically  you must reset them, well good luck trying to reset them your self. It is Not in the owners manual.

From the aggressive nose to the LED taillights it is a nice looking and well engineered ride.  The celestial blue gives it an air of dignity but the 18 inch rims give it that sport look.  The gas mileage is so-so 19 in the city but you don't buy it for that...it has all the Volvo safety features and the 5 year (covers everything) warranty is ""just in case.""

And we are a long time Volvo family !     What a shock to get this one and it is the last one for us.     I bought this car for my children and grandchildren to be safe, but it is difficult to know whether it is safe because I cannot keep it running.... It seems that if the car is not driven daily, the battery runs down.  The dealer insists that nothing is wrong with the battery.    The tires wore out early , apparently because of an alignment problem that caused front and rear tires to wear on the inside.  Although the car was taken in for regular maintenance, this was not discovered until the tires were non-viable.    Little parts were regularly found lying in the car ( they matched the car interior) and appear to be covers for something, but the dealer has no idea what.  The piece in front of the passenger feet keeps falling down and must be repositioned.  It has been replaced by the dealer without improvement.     There Is a side hatch on  the driver's side that will not stay closed. It has been replaced without benefit.  There are more gnawing problems.  I just had to get a coil replaced. we were out of town for 2 weeks and my dayghter had to get people with much older vehicles to provide transportation because no one could keep the car cranked due to presumably the battery ( hard to know .  The car will not crank.  But cannot open car without emergency key and lights do not come on).    I am attempting to charge the battery with heavy duty charger, unsuccessfully.  I can get the lights to come on sometimes.  When I complained again at the dealer while waiting to get the battery checked last time, the salesman tried to sell me another car!!! This one is not paid for....it cost $10,000 more than a mustang, but would be safe and dependable for the family.
In April of 2017, I was able to trade the Volvo in for a Kia.
As we were about to trade, the head liner fell down.  On an internet search, we found that others have had this same problem.
You may also want to make sure that the trunk latch is working.
You will need to test doors and trunk while keys are out of range, as they automatically unlock doors and trunk as you approach.
The 66,617 mileage is the mileage just prior to trade in at 5.5 years. This is very low mileage for us.

Yes the controls for the Nav, phone and temp take a little to get used to, but after the first day they were intuitive. We like the smooth power and shifting this car has. Back roads or Autobahn were equally smooth and enjoyable. We bought the U.S. model and will take it back to the states when we go. The navigation system is great. It notified us of trouble and detoured us well before the slow down. "

Priced up to $10K less than German competitors, while offering equal/better interior space, trunk space, safety features, comfort, build quality, reliability and styling.
The C70 does give up a bit to its competitors in terms of performance - but with the Polestar upgrade it is more powerful than a 328i, and hardly underpowered.
It doesn't have the handling of a BMW or Audi, but still fun to run through twisty roads and rides more comfortably.

At 49K just before warranty expired rear suspension failed (stabilizer bars bushings etc. )_  Destroyed new tires.  At 51k AC COMPRESSOR FAILED ONE THOUSAND MILES OUT OF WARRANTY.  At 55k headliner suddenly and completely detached.  At 60K Oxygen sensor failed.  At 65k brake caliper leaked and needed replacement.  At 72K car started shuddering....... left and right transaxles BOTH failed and needed to be replaced.  At 80k hard top started leaking.  At about 84K main seals failed very expensive $2K.   This card was serviced on schedule and well taken care of and has been a money pit.  I will NEVER buy a Volvo again.   Anyone considering buying a used C70 BEWARE.

UPDATE:  At 94k the hardtop convertible deployment mechanism failed dealer estimated $2500 to repair.  Certainly not from over use...I'd say we deployed the top a few times a month max.  So now we no longer have a functioning convertible.  Also the front headliner that THE DEALER replaced at 55k is slowly detaching in one corner.  At this point we are just letting our 16 year old drive it to school as long as the AC holds up...I am assuming the turbo or the tranny will go next ugh and we will likely donate it to charity since it has virtually no trade in value and I'd have to be crazy to put any more money into this car.  All this on a car that was bought new impeccably dealer maintained, and driven lightly.  Mistake not to trade it in at the first sign of trouble but my wife just didn't want to part with her red convertible.  To Volvo I say drop dead.

volvo,c70,2012,Albert, 01/13/2016,Just OK,3,"Bought this car brand new. Upgraded the turbo 5  with the dealer-installed Polestar software. HP jumped to 272. Really helped on the torque and acceleration on the Interstate.

This car I thought I'd fall in love with; unfortunately not the case. The biggest issue was driver ergonomics. With the cruise control engaged, and time to spread out/relax....there was no where to go. Right leg hits the handbrake in the center console. Left leg hits hard aluminum on the interior door pull. Left forearm rests on hard plastic. Even had some cushions custom made which helped bit. But in the end just plain poor design. 

Another thing, pulling out in traffic. Front wheel drive, you had to pull out, turn, THEN accelerate. If you turned and accelerated, the car would chatter across the pavement. A bit disconcerting. 

Couple plusses. The front seats are GREAT. So are the brakes,

This is NOT a sports car. The cornering is poor, noticeable rollover. No nav system. Stereo surprisingly good. Car spent more time at the dealership for little mess. Expected more for 44K.

volvo,c70,2012,Joda, 08/18/2015,Overpriced garbage!,2,"This car is a horrible waste of time. I bought it because my other half fell in love with it and at the time I couldn't say no. Boy was I fool for that. This is the most boring car i've ever owned!!! I bought the car as a certified pre-owned and it had all the options, which was great, but all that didn't matter once I started having to drive it on a regular basis. The ride is somewhat smooth but you definitely don't feel like you are connected to the road when driving it. I got rid of my E46 BMW 325Ci w/sport package and OMG how I regret it!

I am now driving the C70 as my daily driver and I absolutely HATE this car! It handles like runny dog crap! Way too much body roll and clumsy handling, it does not corner well at all, and good luck if you need to do a u-turn. The turning radius is TERRIBLE, don't expect to do a quick U-turn in this car, instead be prepared to do a three point turn every single time, which is absolutely PATHETIC! I have started calling this the Volvo Town Car because it handles like a granny-mobile even though it is a small car.

The acceleration is sad and even with the Dealer optimized Polestar upgrade, which costs $1k dollars, it still lacks any real oomph other than making the tires chirp a little if you take off abruptly.
The transmission is garbage and does not change gears appropriately for the situation at hand. It upshifts way too quickly even when you are trying to accelerate and get into freeway traffic. I tried using the manual mode a few times and found it utterly useless and very backwards compared to any other european automobile I have driven. At steady cruising speeds on the highway it gets craptastic fuel economy, averaging about 22MPG and even worse with inner city driving (16mpg at best). The suspension is vile, you end up feeling every single damn bump in the road as if you were driving a go-kart. Also the car rattles like crazy when you hit a bump, which is a sure sign of crappy build quality, my 10 year old BMW never suffered such rattles. 
Visibility is total s*** due to the horrible placement of the rearview mirror and the door panels which come up to my shoulder. I'm 6'3"" if I move the seat up from the lowest position my head rubs the roof, which also leads to my next complaint. When putting the top up in this car I have had my head smashed twice. If you are a taller person you have to move your head slightly to the right, otherwise the roof line pillar in the top will come down on your head relatively hard when closing.

The only positive about this car is the upgraded factory sound system and the front seats are super comfy. The dials are pretty simple and the menu interface is great, but that is the only thing I will say that is nice about this horrible handling beast. The repair costs and amount of things that have gone wrong on this car are unforgivable and expensive to repair. The car has stalled out on me numerous times and when it is brought into the dealership they can't diagnose or duplicate the problem, the top has failed to close properly about 5 times now and even with adjustments it sometimes fails to latch properly. Water has been leaking in where the tops meets the windshield, even when it IS completely latched, and we can't seem to locate where it is coming in. I cannot wait to trade this POS in for a new BMW convertible. I've never had the lack of confidence and fear of a car breaking down as I have with this heap of trash and I have owned Jaguars, BMWs, and even an 05 Ford Mustang. Avoid this car at all costs!

volvo,c70,2012,Naro Ayala, 01/02/2018,Nice and Smooth,4,"This car is highly underrated  it has a great look and shape that many vehicles don't have it.  It is imported from Sweden, so expect to pay more for mechanical maintenance but over all is well put together.  If you look for style this vehicle will stand from the rest. Considering than most BMW, Hondas, Lexus etc. they all kinda look the same.  Even tough there is great room for improvement (engine power), the price and affordability will balance that.  This is not a family car but for you and your partner is perfect.  Good luck finding one.

volvo,c70,2012,KC, 08/05/2015,Fun Car BUT......,4,"Have never owned a European car, convertible or a car with a turbo charged engine.  Got all three in the C-70.  Realize this is a sports car and designed for performance however the design is flawed and eats rear tires at a rapid rate!  Have taken the car to the Oklahoma City Volvo Dealership repeatedly as I had to replace tires every 10,000 to 15,000 miles.  They told me this is the way the car is designed and there isn't anything that can be done to correct it.  I have had enough.  Besides burning through 4 tires in less than 25,000 miles, another problem is the car is now discontinued, no longer in production and considered an orphan with a considerable hit to resale value.  I now have European cars, convertibles and cars with turbo charged engines out of my system and will not go down this road again!"
volvo,c70,2012,RVA C70, 08/12/2020,120k mile review,5,"Too often, people write reviews when the car is (a) brand new, or (b) when they're having problems with it.  Let this review serve as neither of those on an 8-year old, daily-driven Volvo C70 with 120k miles on it and in need of a $2k maintenance visit, which we'll be doing.

First off, this car is a joy to own and drive once you get used to it.  The controls are different, but no more different than any of the other hard top convertible controls (Lexus' are unintuitive, BMW's are complicated--you'll get used to either once you drive it a while).  The sound system is great and Bluetooth works well.  The backseats are usable even when (a younger) grandma needs to install child seats twice a year and refuses to give up her convertible.  Styling looks great 8 years later, it is still comfortable and reliable, does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Kudos for Volvo for offering unique color combinations.  The seats are beautiful and more comfortable than any other brand hands down!  We didn't opt for the model with navi due to the cost of maintaining navigation subscriptions long term, them becoming obsolete, additional complexity, and unnecessarily complicated to use.  This car is not cutting edge, not especially sporty/ performance-minded (more of a Lexus competitor than BMW, Infiniti), but it is a very reliable, comfortable highway cruiser and does that job very well.

For the cons, it's nuts that Volvo doesn't have bi-xenon headlights or any safety equipment standard.  The good news, the car is cheaper to fix (bulbs are $25ish) and repair bills at the body shop are lower too.  Volvos need maintenance--all cars do.  There's only 2 dealers (both are sub-par IMO) and 2 Swedish specialists in my city, so you pay a little more.  Since out of warranty, we've replaced a battery, air conditioning switch, drive axle, a handful of bulbs (both headlights, tail light, rear turn signal), remote battery, emblem, fuses, a driver power seat regulator, tires, brakes, and fluids.  It's been a great car.  Repairs have cost slightly more than average but the frequency has been lower than average in my opinion.  It is sometimes difficult to find parts and more than one time the wrong part has come in.  The only outstanding repair that the car needs is about a third of one of the rear tail light LEDs is out (sometimes) and the part is not available.  It doesn't affect safety or drivability and has been that way for 3years and hasn't worsened.

Whether the car is dealer, mechanic, or personally serviced, if it's well taken care of, these are great cruisers!  Parts, bulbs, filters, etc. are available online for very reasonable prices and a lot of the easier repairs are so easy a caveman can do it.  Some repairs are extra complicated (cabin air filter), but most are fine.  The 120k service is expensive--it requires a timing belt, tensioners, water pumps, belts, both filters, few different fluid changes and runs about $2k, but it's a once (or twice if you LOVE your Volvo) in a lifetime of the car service.  Build and paint quality, fit and finish, etc. are all excellent as we don't care/ detail our cars physically like we should and they hold up quite well.  Tires are reasonable.  The C70 is a dying breed, but a car I would absolutely recommend, buy again, consider second hand, etc.  Crazy how cheap they are on the used market!

volvo,c70,2013,Volvo C70 Caspian Blue Fan! Go Cats!, 03/18/2017,"Love the ride, hardtop allows year round use!",5,"I would recommend the BLIS system if you are used to having it. I purchased mine as a certified one since it one only had 7500 miles for a 2013, 0.9% financing, favorite calcite interior with caspian blue exterior. The interior is very luxurious; however, electronics/stereo could be updated. Then again, it is a 2013 car! I don't need entertainment.. just some music, bluetooth and the car! Top down it is a beautiful car; Top up it is a nice coupe to be used almost year round! Hardtop design is pretty incredible.. and you still have some trunk space available with top down. I purchased seat protectors and windbreaker on ebay for additional use/convenience. Several reviews say power is insufficient, but i am quite happy with it. Has all the power I need in town and on the highway. Love it! Love it! 
Update after 7 months of ownership: Love the flexibility of a true car with convertible option depending on weather or travel plans. Car has been wonderful with no issues! Can load my golf clubs easily in the trunk! Seats are so sweet and comfy! 2018 Update: I can put my golf clubs in the front seat with the top down! - just slide the seat back and they fit comfortably! Not a glitch one with this car so far.. oil change, rotate the tires and new wiper blades. Love the ride and reliability! 2020 Update:Still running great! One little noise issue,but trying to figure that out now. Otherwise, no issues with the car and love the convertible!

volvo,c70,2013,Charles, 07/28/2016,Pre Retirement Toy,4,"We wanted a ""Adult"" convertible with enough trunk space for a weekend trip. We also wanted to be able to enter and exit with reasonable ease. There is nearly zero wind buffeting with the top down. We drove it home from the dealer at highway speeds for over two hours. Truly amazing, and comfortable. This model has the premium sound system and it is great. I opted to have the Polestar software upgrade done. It adds +25 hp and 40 lbs of torque and No real change in the fuel economy, and it's keeps the full Volvo warranty.
"
volvo,c70,2013,Coach Rick, 03/26/2018,Don't know what we'll do if this one disappears!!!,4,"This is our fourth Volvo C70...one rag-top and 3 hard tops.  I traded our '11 on one of the very last '13s in the area in Dec '13 and got an excellent price.  It's lacking a couple of things our earlier models had, namely Nav and super-duper audio(whatever the latest was called in '13...DynAudio no longer in use).  It's still(and again) a great cruiser, capable in-town vehicle and a blast to drive with the top down.  Yes, the suspension is more comfy than racy; but this is no track car.  The hardtop, while not silent, is solid and confidence-inspiring...with excellent visibility for a drop-top.  Gas mileage for us has been a solid 25mpg average on 87 octane fuel(Top Tier almost exclusively ).  Road trips are much closer to 30mpg.  I wouldn't mind eliminating some of the wheel-spin under acceleration and cornering; but it IS a FWD after all.  The back seat is for the pup, so humans don't regularly ride in ours, although there's enough room for non-giant folks on trips of shorter duration.  IF Volvo still made the C70, I reckon we would start looking about now(57k miles); but, alas, it may(will?) be a few more years before Volvo gets into the drop -top business again.  IF the next gen is anything like the current C70; we'll be in line for one!!!

Sept 2019 Update:
Well, we have 68k miles on the C70 now and still as happy as ever to own such a nice vehicle.  As the car ages a bit more, necessary repairs/maintenance will take a little of the ""fun"" out of the equation; but I can't complain.  Even with some parking lot mishaps and three scraped corner panels, the main body of the car looks great and we get plenty of compliments on its appearance.  The operation of the top still continues to impress folks and awe youngsters :) 

Had to replace the oil filter housing thingy at a cost of $300+, so that wasn't fun and the 70k mile service will be a little spendy.  Still not a bad price for such a safe and capable vehicle!!!   I keep looking on used car sites just in case I can find a '13 that has been a garage queen for someone...maybe with half the miles of ours ;)    Until then, we will keep on enjoying the top-down experience and overall driving satisfaction provided by our C70!

March '20 Update:
No real changes except for a couple of gremlins showing up.  Windshield washers are not working...not sure where the problem lies.  Getting a bit of stutter/hesitation on low-end mild acceleration; but we're due for a plug change at the next service...maybe a fuel system clean as well.  Despite these little bugs, this car remains a pleasure to drive(especially early morning or evenings with the top down!).  We haven't kept a car this long since our '91 Miata stayed with us for nine years @ 135k miles.  Not sure we will go THAT long; but we sure do like this car!!!

Sept. '20  Update
""BlueBell"" is now seven years old with 75K miles and it's now MY daily driver.  MyDarling got a 2020 XC40 for her commuter-mobile and she loves it!!
A few more repairs have been needed on BlueBell; but she's running great and is still a joy to drive with the top down.  Did a quick 150-mile trip last week and the car is still silky-smooth @ 75mph and feels like it could run all day.  Averaged well over 30mpg on that trip(we are roughly 25mpg in daily driving of stop-and-go and 65mph highways).  
Next service is likely to be a transmission drain/fill, although some Volvo experts don't want to mess with what is working fine.  Had to replace two motor-mounts, some sort of check-valve in the windshield washer line, rear brakes and one strange cooling system hose.  None of these items are cheap on a Volvo.  I'm now seeing a local independent Volvo wrench for service, ""maybe"" saving a few bucks along the way.  It wouldn't surprise me if the suspension might need some updating in the next year or so; although it's performing fine in day-to-day driving.  New plugs a few
 months ago didn't make quite the difference I thought they would; but the engine is running fine and the average MPG numbers are good.
I try to pay attention to the top and its operation...all is running smoothly at this point.  Keeping up with the lubing and cleaning of the various points of concern is the main thing and ours shows no signs of trouble!  Still super solid with the top up or down!
IF I could find a garage-queen C70 with maybe half the miles, I would consider trading; but this one is aging well, IMO, even if she does need some attention from time to time!

volvo,c70,2013,Dave Nau, 01/12/2019,"It's my Convertible, Hobby Car, and Truck",3,"I am perhaps not the usual Volvo C70 owner.  When my 2011 Honda CR-V started to have serious engine and air conditioner problems, that were going to be over $5000 to fix, I decided to try to find a convertible with a 2000 pound tow rating to replace the Honda.  I've owned five convertibles in my lifetime and it was time for another.  However, I have two small boats: one rig is 1000 pounds and the larger one is 1500 pounds.  The 2006-2013 Volvo C70 is the only modern convertible with a 2000 pound tow rating (braked trailer) and a 1640 pound tow rating (un-braked trailer). Both my un-braked rigs are under 1640 pounds, so they are with-in the specification.  With the C70 (purchased in April, 2018 with 62,000 miles on it), I now have a car that is my only car, and as such, it is my daily driver, my convertible, my hobby car, and my truck for towing.  It tows both my boats very well, much better than the CR-V did, runs on regular gas just fine (Volvo specified minimum grade of 87), has front-wheel drive for good wintertime traction, has a big trunk, a reasonable back seat with LATCH attachments for the grand-kids, plenty of room in front for me at 6"" 4"" and weighing 275 pounds, and is a great looking car.  The convertible top works flawlessly, the Bridge of Weir leather is high quality, the car only uses about 1/4 of a quart of synthetic oil between the 10,000 mile oil change intervals, and I have an independent shop with-in walking distance of me that maintains it at a reasonable cost. For towing, I lock it in 4th gear of the 5-speed automatic, run at 60MPH, and it pulls the boats great.  I get 32MPG highway, 25MPG just driving around town, and for towing, I get 20-22MPG depending on terrain. Curt makes an 1 1/4"" receiver hitch for it that mounts completely behind the rear bumper cover, with only the small receiver portion of the hitch showing, and it's not very visible. To see my trailer when backing up to retrieve a boat, I just retract the top and thus have great visibility.  In the 18,000 miles I've put on it, my only real repair has been an air conditioner pressure switch, and it was not very expensive to get fixed. I have made one modification, since these these cars tend to run at the high end of the Volvo spec for negative camber in the rear suspension, and thus often cause premature tire wear and tire noise after about 10K miles on a pair of rear tires, as mine did.  I fixed this problem by installing a a pair of aftermarket adjustable rear upper control arms, plus two new rear tires.  The alignment shop that installed them then dialed in the negative camber to the low end of the spec (about -.7 to -1.0 degree camber), fixing the unadjustable -2.6 degrees my car had.  (The spec is -.7 to -2.7 degrees, but more than about -1.4 degrees causes the premature inner tire wear and roaring noise.)  I've put 16,000 miles on since the fix and it's still quiet, with the tires are not showing unusual wear, so all good.  Also, pre-2013 cars had a firmware problem in the satellite radio portion of the stereo that would run the battery down if left parked for a week.  The 2013's have a firmware fix for this from the factory.  Also, 2013's are the only models that support bluetooth music streaming from a phone or other device.  If you are like me, and can only have one car, but need it to do all this, the 2013 Volvo C70 is the way to go.  It was the last model year they were built and mine was made in December, 2012.  I love it. I plan to drive it until it hits at least 250K miles.
July, 2020 Update: Car is still as I reviewed two years ago.  Only component failure was an A  pressure switch, which was not real expensive to replace.  I still need to watch the negative rear camber on alignments by staying at the low range of the spec (keep at -.7 to -1.2).

I do know about all of the claims to infamy on here, like the battery not starting on the third day, you needed to reset the computer. The rough idle is either motor mounts (problem on all volvos) or ignition coils. The cup holder had to be put there because there was nowhere else to put it, if it was under the arm rest then the arm rest couldn't come down all the way. So there you have it, it is a good car and if you take care of it and know how to take care of the Swedish/Japanese beauty she will take care of you."

Had a massive oil leak, which took my mechanic boyfriend countless hours and dollars trying to fix. That was fixed... then on to the rest of the problems. Now, my favorite issue is that it revs when in drive, park, or neutral. It accelerates and decelerates all by it self if my foot isn't on the gas pedal. How fun!

I had to remove my drink to put in a cd and couldn't really see any buttons when the cup was there. But now I don't have to worry about it because I pushed in in one time and it's completely stuck.

Currently have an intermittent starting problem that our local dealer doen't seem to be able to fix.

Later that evening we went out to eat and when we first parked, the car revved up again, then I turned the car off.
When we came back out the car wouldn't start at all.
Didn't sound like a typical timing belt issue, sounded more like it was out of gas.
Towed car home.

to create a fun little sedan that will 
appeal to a younger demographic.  I've 
had no major issues with mine, but 
little things have plagued me... 
especially that darn ""check engine"" 
light that seems to need resetting 
every month.  The paint is of very poor 
quality and looks much older than three 
years even though I've had the car 
repainted.  The leather seats have 
already started to crack and the car 
has less than 40k miles.  Overall, I 
would not recommend this particular car."

Worst seats I have ever sat in. Apparently Mitsubishi made volvos interior for this car, this year. Center console armrest, all cup holders, and many random plastic peices broke while in normal use, just came off in my hand. Thousands and thousands of dollars in random various repairs later(note I only drove the car for 20,000 miles while it was young) I sold the car for a fraction of what I bought it for. Okay gas mileage, okay performance, seems to be a reliable car when the whole thing isn't falling apart

to fix minor repairs to windows, visor

malfunctioning engine maintenance

a few, the bulbs are constantly burning 
out, the front cup holder blocks the 
stereo, I get poor gas mileage, and it 
seems to be in the shop all of the 
time.  On the upside, the seats are 
comfy for a car it's size, and it has a 
peppy engine, and it's relatively fun

rattling of sideview mirrors at 65mph, 
replaced all four brakes @20,000 miles,

However, unit only had 25K miles. I've been extremely happy with the vehicle. It's paid off, and has had minimal problems during ownership. Minor repairs included internal thermostat replacement, exhaust joint component replacement, CD player, and headlight replacement. All repairs were covered under warranty, but would have cost < $300. Recently, I've noticed some minor oil spotting and some interior lights (buttons) that are not lit - most probably a fuse."
volvo,s40,2000,SCR, 12/26/2008,A Mistake,3,"One thing after another. I have had the care for 2 years, and have spent over $3000 on repairs. Every time I think I'm done, something else comes up. Like everyone else, the headlights burn out fast. Looks like most people say their S40 is fast, but mine is sluggish and I can't figure out how the Turbo works. It seems random. I just had to replace the an axle and all motor mounts ($1900). Bad sensors. Check engine light will not go off... Replacement parts are expensive and hard to find. I am selling it, regardless of my loss, and buying a new Civic."

My front passenger door no longer opens from the outside, and like mentioned before the back door locks stick. The cup holder position makes no sense to me and one of the weather strips on the top of the car flew off while on the freeway and is 150 to replace.

Every time I changed something I kept telling myself oh after changing this it would run good without problems.  So  now the first chance I will get I am getting rid of it.  I have another car, toyota and no problems.  I will be getting toyota as soon as volvo is gone. I feel bad for the next person who is going to get it.

Let me first disagree with some: the armrest is fine, paint is amazing and I don't know what glare they're talking about. That being said, I believe the manual seats could be redesigned, and the cup holder is atrocious. Rear locks do stick. A lot of little nothings. However, it's a blast to drive at speed. It also handles reasonably well and I like the stiff feel. It's also very safe speaking from fender-bender experience. I recommend it as a great college car (when I bought it, anyway).  "

While the car is decent and can last a good while if HEAVILY cared for (now at 135K and still running strong), it just does not have the build quality of a Swedish built sedan.  Volvo if you learn anything from this experience, do NOT sell out again just to get market share...it hurts you in the long run.  Volvo buyers are NOT simple minded and we know good products and bad products.  The 2000-04 S40 is just a bad product (relative to what we expect)"

I really don't get the negative comments.   Maybe, as one person mentioned, mine hasn't had the same issues because I ordered it before they came out & it was delivered from overseas??   But, it is NOT the first year for the car; they had been out in Europe for a couple of years.  I've replaced a few things, but for a car with 100,000 miles, that's typical.  The headlights did seem to go out too quickly at first, but doesn't seem to be an issue now.  They're about $12 at PepBoys & they'll put them in for free, or for $5 if they're not feeling generous.

but that's normal wear and tear.  Other 
than that just my routine 7,500 hundred 
mile service.  The car isn't as bad as 
the reviews suggest.  Most of the 
complaints were rectified on the 2001

to complain.  The same types of

complaints about blown lights?? Is this

My husband feels like he's driving

I've just about experienced every 
negative comment that is written in the 
reviews: from replacement of bulbs, 
wind noise, rattles, brakes, engine 
lights, etc.  It is a great car in many 
ways, but the reliability is horrible.  
Although the S40 is cheaper than most 
of the foreign cars on the market when 
compared to BMW, Audi, MB etc..the cost 
of repairs and regular maintenance can 
be astronomical once the warranty 
expires.  I would definetly not suggest 
this vehicle to anyone."

been fixed, and I need to book my

choice.  Overall, I like my little 
Volvo,its quick and peppy and when its 
clean and waxed it looks rather nice.  
With a new baby (three kids total), I

it - got a deal that was really hard to

cars and I must say this S40 may be the 
most competent car I've ever owned.  
The longer I owned it the more things 
I've noticed about the car that I 
like.  Sure, I've had the 'check 
engine' light problem, and it does burn 
up headlights, and I have had to 
replace the brake pads, but all things

volvo,s40,2000,Brendan Kelly, 02/03/2003,S40 - The Brake Eater,2,"I write this on the eve of my 
45,000 ""tune up.""  Based on past 
experience, this is when they tell me 
that I need to replace all of my brakes 
and rotors, even though these were just 
replaced at 39,500.  

I'm so fed up with this car. The 
brakes, which I've replaced 3 times, 
cost about $500 each time. Also, a 
new warning light greets me about once 
a month.

Those of you happy with your car are in 
for a rude awakening when you realize 
how much this piece of junk has 
depreciated in a short period of time.

volvo,s40,2000,ex-BMW Owner, 07/11/2003,Happy with my Volvo,4,"I had previously owned a 1987 BMW 325 
series and LOVED it! I was the 
original owner (13 years) and it had 
270,000 miles on it.  I was sure that 
I would buy another BMW.  A friend of 
mine was buying a pre-owned VOLVO and 
he saw the S40 in the showroom and 
immediately thought of me.  I 
instantly liked it. I now have almost 
60,000 miles on the car. I have 
replaced the brakes twice and the 
headlights 2 or 3 times, the battery 
(April 2003) and tires (May 2003). 
Overall, I am very pleased with the 
car and I hope to keep it another 7 
years.  "
volvo,s40,2000,unhappy mom, 07/28/2003,Lemon,2,"I have had all the problems that have 
been listed in these reviews, some 
repeatedly.  This is the worst car I 
have ever owned.  Plus, the dealership 
has not been willing to work with us.  
The power assist brake system failed 
while driving, and luckily I was able 
to stop the vehicle.  The airbag light 
was on at the time this occurred, and 
the dealership informed me that the 
airbags would not have deployed had 
there been an accident.  The brakes 
continue to give us problems."

expense), several rear brake bulbs and 
taillight bulbs,broken window switch, 
rear brake pads. Car still grunts and

but overall very satisfied.  Worked 
with Volvo of the Triad in Winston-
Salem, NC and Volvo of Dallas in 
Carrollton, TX.  The sales people (Trey)
at Volvo of the Triad were great to 
work with.  Totally opposite the 
dealership in Greensboro (Crown). Have 
referred my brother and two friends to 
Volvo of the Trid and they both bought 
Volvo's there.  Most of my service work 
has been with Volvo of Dallas and the 
shop supervisor (Aldo) is the best.  "
volvo,s40,2000,Clay Bittner, 02/28/2003,Short of Expectations,3,"I thought when buying the S40 that I 
was stepping up to a luxury automobile 
that would cross over into the service 
provided etc.  I definitely thought 
wrong.  The buying and service 
experience I had with my second car (an 
Infiniti) was far more enjoyable than 
the Volvo experience.  Owning my Volvo 
was a similar experience to my 
experiences owning a Honda which is not 
what I thought I was getting into.  
Probably will not own or lease another 
Volvo.  Looking back I should have gone 
for the Infiniti G20 instead although 
the car has been ""OK""."

True, headlight problems twice, but 
repaired for free.  Check engine

problems.  Hated the console design, 
but only after my golden retriever 
puppy pointed out the flaws.  
It's an attractive little car - always 
get compliments on it!!!  Disappointed 
that it hasn't held its value....I'm 
concerned that the ""Ford"" name will 
cheapen the value.  However, I plan to 
buy/lease a V70 to accommodate the 2 
dogs, potting soil, trips to Home

unreliable, possibly cause its not a

with a zippy turbo engine, but the 
brakes, tires, engine all have been 
problematic. Nothing lasts as long as 
it should. The power steering failed 
on me. Right now im looking at 
having serious engine repairs. Its

the piece of junk has always vibrate at 
70 miles per hour.  I suggest before 
you buy one of these, you take it out 
on the Interstate and get it up to 
speed.  Dyer & Dyer Chamblee really 
should feel guilty for allowing these

bad, it sits parked in my garage.

I get about 28 mpg on the interstate (which is most of my driving).  I've had little in the way of any problems.   If asked to present constructive critism for the company I would say the armrest between the front seats. I would consider it pretty flimsy, it has broken three times.

became available in the US.  It has been a 
reliable, quality car during this time.  The 
headlights did burn out rather soon (but only 
require a new bulb that dealership gives 
away).  I got the winter/leather package and 
this has made all the difference.  Heated 
seats and traction control make it a great 
winter car, turbo and nice wheels/tires make 
it a great driving car too.  Priced against the

better deal.  "

serious problem with it. Why are people
complaining about the size of the car? 
If you want it to be bigger, get an 
S60 or 80! Yes, the cupholder position 
sucks but it has all been changed. 
This was the first year that the car 
was released in the US, and is bound 
to have some design flaws, but they 
have all been fixed in the newer 
models. Maybe if people were less 
abusive with their car, then they 
would not have problems. Also, the 
price of maintenance is high because 
ITS A EUROPEAN AUTOMOBILE!!!! What do

The red paint comes off on a drying towel after washing.  The stereo speakers stopped working.  The cabin climate fan just stopped working. What else?: Rattles, check engine light, headlight bulbs, rust forming under hood seam, turn signal malfunctioning, etc.  Never again Volvo. Honda, here I come. "

over 100K miles on this car in heavy 
traffic and on road trips and I have 
never regretted the purchase once.  My 
service has been excellent, my 
reliability good and the car is without 
question a well performing small car.
I have to say I understand the weiners, 
they just did not understand the car 
they purchased.  There was a defect 
with the headlights which was 
completely fixed under warranty.  The 
brake pads do wear quickly.  Volvos 
have great brakes, they stop on a dime. 
Great brakes wear quickly, that's the 
trade-off.  I would never trade my 
safety and breaking for saving a $100 
in brake pads."

twice,brakes,brakes,brakes,and 
headlight wipers. Oh,did I mention 
brakes? Brakes have failed and makes me 
feel unsafe. Lots of other repairs on 
miscellaneous parts. Our service dept. 
is terrible and the dealer won't help 
us out of the lease. We are counting 
down the months until we're out! This 
is one family that won't be buying

was quite surprised when I got 
financed into an S40 at agreeable 
terms. The maintenance schedule is a 
little high, I must admit, but in my 
opinion it's worth it. In one year, 
I've put about 20,500 miles on the 
car. (This will go down as I moved 
closer to the city). Very comfortable, 
very solid, and fun to drive. Like it 
a lot but will upgrade to a station 
wagon (V70)when I can. "

have put this car at 137 MPH on 
Alligator Alley and it could have still 
kept going a tad more had I not cought 
up with  traffic. Getting to 130 MPH is 
a breeze. Need a stretch to get to the 
137 I put it to. Acceleration is very 
good. I have left more than 1 BMW 325 
asking for a second chance. Response 
from mid speeds is also superb. The 
interior is suprisingly comfortable. It 
looks smaller outside but feels large 
inside, even in the backseets.It is 
more roomy than the A4 by far. The 
trunk is very generous as well. The car 
has had no problems, just regular

It is starting to bubble and peel, and has been garage kept and very rarely driven. Plastic molding strips along the rear window have popped out and even the dealership can't get them back in. Brakes went out once, and are on the way out now.  Turbo replaced once, the interior design is horrible.  Adjusting the seat angle by turning a knob, what's that about?  The cup holder over the radio is another craptacular design that I could do with out.  Thank God this isn't my car and I'm only driving it till my 91 trans am is out of the transmission shop."

years I've had it.  I have had very 
few problems and those were handled by 
the dealership.  They replaced both 
the headlamps when one went out.  The 
brakes made it to 25K - and were 
inexpensive to fix at the dealership.  
Gas mileage in the city is 24mpg. The 
hubcap centerpieces kept popping out,

great little car."
volvo,s40,2000,Auher, 03/14/2005,Volvo=Reliable??? Think Again....,2,"I've never been one to write car reviews, always sort of thought they are all the same enough that while you might have problems, they aren't too bad.  Then I bought a 2000 Volvo S40 ""Certified Pre-Owned.""  The problems started early on......the wonderful headlight problem. Volvo knows there was a problem was this, the resistor wasn't built into the car properly, and they issued a ""Service Bulletin"" on it. Amazingly, ""Service Bulletins"" aren't covered under the Certified Pre-Owned warranty. So after burning through 3 sets of Pep Boys headlights in 1 month, I called up Volvo to make an appt. to get my S40's problem fixed. I thought since I even had the Service Bulletin, it would be easy"
volvo,s40,2000,Barely Satisfied RI, 06/16/2005,Crumb Cake,3,"My wife wanted it for ""safey,"" but she quickly was sorry we bought it.  Of course, I ended up with it. Many problems with electrical systems during the first two years.  The interior is smallish in the front. I would never think of sitting in back...my two kids in car seats barely fit back there. The dash design is poor--the cup holder hangs in front of CD player so you can't change disks without risking a major spill. As another reviewer noted, the cup holder is a junky design, and the hardware doesn't work properly. Same goes for rear holder. Ashtray poorly placed--hits gear shift when taking it out, so you have to put into gear to empty trash. Pain chips easy. Rubber door trim is disaster"
volvo,s40,2000,Joe Nemastil, 07/16/2006,2000 S40 Great Fun/long term,5,"There have been many ""negative"" remarks for this vehicle and model year, but maybe, as my vehicle was an OSD [oversears delivery], somewhat better build quality was initiated into it, I do not know.  I never found any problems with my motor mounts.  There were the electrical headlight ""burnouts"", but the TSB[tech servive bulletin] for this problem solved it. An A/C problem was fixed via another TSB.  Converting the brake pads and rotors to semimetallic Mintex pads, and Power Slot rotors, reduced significantly the front dust, and greatly added to the OE fantastic stopping power of the EBD/ABS system.  My S40 has been exceptionally reliable and dependable!  Changed wipers to PIAA brand."
volvo,s40,2000,JLba, 11/03/2006,Volvo for life.... never,2,I had dreamed of owning a Volvo for years and when I finally got my Volvo the nightmare began.  In only owning my car for one in a half years I have easily put over $3000 in repairs.  The check engine light turned on every other week it seemed like. Even Volvo repaired it and only 500 miles later it was on again.  Volvo uses the cheapest plastic and it breaks just by touching it. The only thing I really liked was how it handled and the trunk and glove box space. Besides that Volvo should think about starting from scratch because this car is a waste.   
volvo,s40,2000,Praveen, 11/07/2006,Great,4,It's a nice car. the interior is great and i always feel it as i am in a new car. But comparatively with other cars engine  sounds more.

 MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE -dealer cant fix

I am going to get rid of it and never buy a Volvo again.  The check engine light comes on more often than not without a defineable cause.  Shift handle now fails to lock in park position."

course, let's not forget that pesty 
check engine light (which others might

extremely fast, like every 15K, but to 
be fair, it stops on a dime.

Volvo dealerships treat all car owners 
like gold, even if you have their 
lowest priced model as I do. They fix 
head and tail lights for free and with 
no argument and will provide a loaner 
car if only you ask for one. Customer 
service is a number one priority and 
they are THE BEST. It is mostly the

Seems as though I have the same likes/issues as most of the others on the list.  I have replaced both the front and rear brakes (car only has 31,000 miles), the 'check engine light' comes on/off constantly (it's an emissions fault, but does not affect the car in anyway, but would make it difficult to sell if the light came on), and I have replaced the front bulbs 3 times, though the latest set have lasted over a year."
volvo,s40,2000,Mrs. Showers, 03/23/2002,I'm Glad It's Gone,3,I have never had so many problems with a car in my life.  It has spent time in the shop (averaged out) every four months.  It was in 33 days at one point for a cracked battery casing which caused battery acid to spew in the engine compartment.  The control module and several other parts had to be replaced.  The headlights also burned out frequently. The mileage never impressed me. Not enough room for more than 1 passenger.I took a bath financially to get rid of this leased vehicle and I'm glad I did.  I will say that I felt like I was in a foreign film when I went zipping down our narrow side streets.
volvo,s40,2001,kdooms94, 05/03/2012,Not too bad so far.,3,"I have had a couple issues with the car. I replaced the brakes and rotors when i bought it, but that was my choice. The check engine light is almost always on, but I just ignore it as the car still runs fine and gets great fuel economy without it. I blew a radiator hose a while ago, but that isn't unexpected on a car that is 12. And i blew a brake hose, which also isn't uncommon on a car that is that age, as i have friends with fords, and toyotas, and hondas who have also experienced similar issues. My recommendation is to use high grade fuel when you can, as the car starts really hard and runs rough on regular fuel, and probably contributes to many of the problems others have listed."
volvo,s40,2001,prodigy1, 10/10/2013,Miss it a lot,4,"I bought a 01 s40 with 30k miles on it and
NEVER gave me an ounce of trouble. I took very good care of it. The dealers always treated me great when I went in to do major maintenance, such as replace turbo o-rings and timing belt. The dealer prices where not bad at all. It's sad to see so many people had such bad luck with theirs. Unfortunately a year ago my wife fell asleep and flipped it over a couple of times but it's a volvo and her and the kids walked away with only seat belt burns. It had 135k miles on it and ran like it was new. I highly recommend this car to anyone. And not all but most of what I'm reading in other reviews that are ""complaints"" are wear and tear maintenance items."
volvo,s40,2001,bbqbandit, 04/20/2013,Love my S40,4,I bought the car two years ago and it has been a dream. Incredible power and fuel economy. Body is in amazing condition with no rust and it's so much fun to drive. 
volvo,s40,2001,Travis R, 02/15/2016,Great car its cheap but full of luxury and quality,5,"This car is great. Never had any issues with it other than general maintenance which is understandable at 82k miles. The car is cheap, yet it is a luxury car and it defiantly shows it. The seats are very comfortable, high quality leather throughout the whole car, even the new cars leather seats cheap out once you get to the back seat. Quality materials throughout, the cupholders are a joke but something pretty minor for a overall good car. It is safe with 8 air bags, comfy, and fun to drive. The motor has plenty of power, the acceleration is awesome, and the turbo is plus as well. Overall if the car is taken care of it will take care of you. I wouldn't doubt reaching 200k in this car in the future.

volvo,s40,2001,mkoh55, 03/14/2012,what a decision,3,"So I bought this car two years ago...thought I was getting a good buy but within a month I had problems. First, the service light came on and they told me I needed an oil change. Then the check engine light came on and had to replace and o2 sensor, then the thermastat, now spark plugs and wires, replaced two complete struts, one coil spring, now I am on another o2 sensor and ECT sensor. The check engine light seems to always be on and something seems to always be breaking. Horrible decision, intending on getting rid of it. "
volvo,s40,2001,awree5, 03/01/2012,Not a great car,3,"I bought the vehicle last year with 62,000 miles on it. Being a Volvo, I thought it was reliable and a great buy. As soon as I pulled out of the lot check engine light went on and brought it back to get the spark plugs fixed. I recently just traded it in and I have had it less than a year! I had to replace brakes, check engine light would not turn off, blown turbo, two ball joints, shocks, and lastly to top it off there was a transmission problem after just four months of having it. Something broke every month and costs were just as much as I bought it for. Got rid of it with 78,000 miles god bless who ever gets one"
volvo,s40,2001,Jesse Coley, 05/18/2007,A great car if you treat it right.,4,"I bought this car used with 80,000 miles on it. It's currently pushing 100,000 miles and I have had none of these problems other reviewers keep talking about. My brakes are FINE. The Check Engine light only comes on if I gun the engine while it is still cold, but then the light usually goes back off before the day is over. I had to replace the turbo when I first purchased the car, but I'm sure that's why it was for sale in the first place. Turbo cars have special needs. Synthetic oil and letting the engine idle a bit before shutting off the car is a MUST. I'm sure the previous owner didn't. Some people complain about bulbs burning out. The solution is to turn off the day-time running lamps."

in three and a half years;
Sunroof shade out of track, bad plugs, engine mounts replaced, both engine coils replaced, cv joint replaced, blown head gasket, new radiator, o2 sensors, catalytic converter, Cvvt valve leaking oil, cvvt valve sensor clogged, climate control problems, radio problems, window regulator, over $4000.00 in repairs in the past year.

I got it at 81K and knew that it would last, and it did. Yes, the cup holders are awful, but if you are like me and not like to have picnic in your vehicle, you will be just fine.  I still average 28mpg with the ac running here in San Diego. If this car goes to junk, I would buy one again for about 7000 bucks. Beats buying a Civic as these are very very safe cars. The only issue I had was to change the coil wire which ran about 70 bucks! Just go and buy one, if it feels good, then it must be the right car."
volvo,s40,2001,Rusty, 05/27/2009,Good Car,4,"After 90k miles and 5 years, our used off-lease 2001 volvo S40 is still a very reliable car. While under warranty, we had to replace the Climate Control system and a coil spring broke, but it always starts and gets us where we need to go. Bought it with 33k miles, now has 124k miles and it still runs great. It's like having a BMW but without the BMW pricetag and with Volvo reliability. I anticipate we'll drive ours until 200k miles easily. "

Sunroof needed to be replace upon driving it off the lot (sunroof leaked in water), suspension has a lot of noise, Check engine light comes on when it wants, AC comes on when it wants and doesn't work at intermediate speeds, constantly replacement of bulbs (especially headlights, twice a year and they are not cheap), paint chips easy, turbo line leaked causing a oil leak, constantly replacement of brake pads and rotors, poor braking, AWFUL Fuel economy (around 17 MPG) continues below in improvements section*"
volvo,s40,2001,gurgstar, 02/26/2002,Happy with my S40,4,"I have owned the 2001 S40 for about a year and a half.  Contrary to many of the other reviews (many of which pertain to the 2000 model anyway, which I know had more issues), I haven't had any service problems with mine, aside from the ""Check Engine"" light coming on once.  The car handles well, and the engine is powerful (though my previous car was a V6 and I do miss the V6 a bit).  My only complaint would be the that the interior controls (climate and radio) are poorly designed."
volvo,s40,2001,AJFH, 03/26/2008,Only 7.7 years not for life,2,"Purchased this car after seeing it in France in the summer of 2000. We were first impressed by its ride, peppy motor and looks. We thought the car would last well beyond a estimated 10 years..oops big mistake. It is no better than a Chevrolet when it comes to reliability. Numerous visits to the shop for all kinds of repairs. Luckily we bought the 100000 mile warranty. Since it ended in August 2007 over $3000 in repairs have been done and its still doesn't run well. The engine light is continually on. It's just become a headache."

I love this car. Turbo...broooommmm. Mechanical, nothing outside of regular maintenance or wear and tear...even very little there. Only ""problem"" is the fan blower for the climate control does not work on
""2"" setting so you either go with very low at 1 or with 3...no problem. Had to replace her battery last week...okay it is a 10 year old car. Replaced the timing belt at the interval recommended in the maintainance manual. In about 2 years I will be looking at a ""new"" used car...it will be a 2006 or newer Volvo S60 or 80.

volvo,s40,2001,Tristan, 04/23/2009,"Good car, bad cupholder",4,"My S40 is great to drive. It handles well, has nice acceleration, and is great when it comes to protection in a crash. It has had a few mechanical issues since I've had it. At around 87000 miles, the left front wheel bearings needed to be replaced. At about 88000 miles, and after getting into one accident, the cruise control quit. Took the Volvo dealership an hour to tell me that they didn't know what was wrong, got it fixed by a local mechanic in a few hours. Fuel pressure regulator gave out at 103000 miles, as did the spark plug cables. Check engine light is overzealous. Parts are very expensive if you get into a crash or break a lens for the lights. Otherwise, this is a great car!"
volvo,s40,2001,RPF, 10/27/2009,Never Again,3,"I'll be honest, it IS fun to drive when everything is working properly, however that's rare... Check engine light seems to be a continuously-on feature, parts are expensive and it's never an easily diagnosable fix.  Sensors are waaaay to temperamental.  The car was bucking like crazy when I put anything other than the over-priced Volvo plugs in it.  Climate controls work when they feel like it."

The warranty never covered anything except my alternator, and it sat at the dealer for 1 month before it could be fixed. The check engine/service lights on constantly. Brakes and tires wore out way too early. I tried to trade in and was only offered $2500 for it (the AC finally went out and it was way too much to fix it). Literally in the shop once a month. The guys at the dealership know me on a first-name basis b/c I'm there so much! Too bad, but it's so cute on the outside!  And the cupholder? Seriously? You have to take out your drink to change CDs!"

My check engine light continues to come on and no one can figure out why.  Other repairs include fuel pump, rotors, every light bulb in car, thermostat, fuses and other minor things.  I purchased this car for safety and my concern now is that with all of the repairs that I have made (most of them on-road surprises), that this car actually compromises the safety of the driver - not protects it."

Windshield fluid spray/wipers randomly coming on, air/heat confused as to whether it should be putting out hot or cold air and at high or low, constantly replacing lights, check engine light coming on and off when it pleases (believe this is a sensor issue).

It's a little small on the inside, but

a family sedan, but as a DINK car

The fuel pump is going out, so it will need to be replaced soon though. It is very costly to maintain or repair though. It requires a higher grade of gas, and synthetic oil, and a special oil filter size, most cars have one size, but not this one. It doesn't get as good of mileage as I was hoping, on the road it only gets about 28, in town it gets 25. There is a lot of road noise, but can be drowned out with the stereo.

and safety, instead I got a car I can only sell at a loss and fear of expensive 
repairs after the warranty expires"
volvo,s40,2001,Tom in Nor Cal, 10/28/2002,"A little pricey, IMHO.",4,"Overall it's been a reliable, fun 
little car. I've read some of the 
horror stories from other reviews, I 
haven't experienced any of these. I 
bought the S40 and a Cross Country the 
same day. Volvo of Pleasanton, CA has 
a great sales stff but go elsewhere 
for service, trust me! The only 
problem I've had with the car is the 
shift-lock mechanism getting stuck."
volvo,s40,2001,Disgruntled, 10/06/2002,High Maintenance,2,"This vehicle will cost you oodles in 
maintenance costs.  You will need rear 
brake pads every 12K-15K miles ($178), 
and front pads every 25K-30K miles.  
That means with every scheduled service 
you can add at least $180 extra for 
brake pads.  Very disappointing!

Also, headlamp burned out at 15K miles, 
and need to take the battery out to 
replace the bulb!"
volvo,s40,2001,youareslow, 12/31/2002,I love my Volvo S40,4,"I leased the S40 after comparing it to 
a Jetta GLS.  The Volvo came out to be 
$10 more a month for the same term and 
down payment.  I'm glad I paid the 
extra 10 bucks.  I love the Volvo.  It 
is a solid car with a lot of zip and 
is reasonable on gas.  The interior is 
top quailty and the fit and finish is 
great.  The only problem I have had in 
the first 20k is one of the head lamps 
went out.  The dealer replaced both 
under warranty and the service was 
great.  If you are looking for 
something a little different this is a 
great car."
volvo,s40,2001,vonts, 03/01/2002,S40 2000,4,"Nice car except:

1. Paint on the hood leaches off when you wax it.  Super soft paint still arguing over getting the hood repainted.
2. It's been in the shop twice for warranty work, nothing that stranded me, but still.
3. Better than the normally aspirated S60, I had one as a loaner while mine was in the shop and for that much money the dash and switches are cheaply done."

drive 90 miles round trip, mostly 
highway, and wanted a car with better 
fuel economy than my Expedition. So 
far, the Volvo fits the bill. It's very 
fun to drive and gets great gas 
mileage. I compare it to a Scirroco VW 
I had in the early 80's...very peppy 
without the requirement of needing to 
sleep in the back seat overnight on the 
side of the road due to breakdowns!!!
Plus, my stepson has already informed

it has been in the shop 47 DAYS! The 
check engine light keeps going on and 
off, there are many rattles in the 
headliner, and when the dealer tried 
to fix this, they caused a leak to 
start in the roof. The car even came 
with a defect, a bad turbo hose that 
caused the car to stall randomly. The 
front brakes and rotors needed 
replacement after 21000 miles, the 
rear brake pads much earlier than 
that. The sunroof leaked, the antenna 
broke, and the dealer never had the 
parts on hand to fix the car. "
volvo,s40,2001,RandyK, 10/30/2003,Peppy Car Heavy On Safety,4,"I really enjoy the S40; it was quite 
peppy with excellent breaking for my 
driving style. I was especially 
impressed with the parking breaks grip 
on steep hills; no pressure against the 
transmission. I have had several of the 
problems others had: check engine 
light, brake/tire wear and headlight 
blowout. The check engine light was a 
recall upgrade, the headlight bad luck. 
The tires/breaks were understandable. 
Performance rated tires higher than 'H' 
wear on all cars at 12-15K. Cheaper 
tires will last to 45K. Swift breaking 
usually means fast wear. I'll pay the 
extra for safety, as luxury cars in 
general are not cheap to upkeep."

The 1st winter the Winter mode drive locked up.  The car was in the shop 2 weeks. The repair writer called to tell me that 2 engineers were coming in from Canada to look at our tranny. Like that's supposed to make you feel better.  They replaced the tranny and ever since we've had a slight turbo lag. The steering squeeks, the right dash speaker grill pops up (seen on all 2001's), the side mirror button is wonky, the Service light always comes on, the AC is possessed by the devil.  Every scheduled maint or oil change costs over $300.  Next time we're buying a BMW."

miles with it.  That is when the back 
brakes needed to be replaced and also 
the tires.  Of course none of this 
stuff is handled under warranty.  I 
leased the vehicle specifically so I 
wouldn't have to deal with these types 
of repairs but no such luck.  I also 
think this car is a little sensitive to 
normal bumps in the road.  "

The car has a great interior, is fun to drive, and is the best value for its price range.  It was cheaper than the BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and Acura equivalents and comparable in features.   It may not turn the eyes as much as an Audi, but it is a rock solid car.  I had a friend that bought a 2001 Audi A4 Quattro that has been in the shop 10 times more than my car."

going on unitl Volvo finally replaced 
O2 sensor 2 years later. Brakes and 
tires wear out prematurely. It seems 
like at every service appointment I 
must replace the front or rear brakes, 
not only the pads but also the discs 
and rotors.  Trunk lock and gear shift 
knob had to be replaced. The worst part 
is that after 3.5 years the paint 
started peeling off the car in the area 
around all 4 wheel wells and where the 
fenders meet the bumbers.  It is clear 
that this car, which was made in the 
Netherlands at a factory shared by 
Volvo and Mistsubishi has a lot more 
Mitsubishi than Volvo in it. Overall, I

A/C never worked right and not cold enough despite multiple trips to Volvo dealer. CD player constantly skips even with entire new factory Volvo unit. Intrument panel/radio/cup holder ENTIRELY NON-USER FRIENDLY and confusing! Only good thing was turbo engine was quite peppy and good gas mileage. Because this car was so small and multitude of creature ""dis- comforts"" that it had, I had the pleasure of dumping it for a nice big SUV. Whew..what a relief!!"
volvo,s40,2001,Scott Bentrup, 01/27/2005,Poor Man's BMW,4,"I bought in Feb 04, and fell in love immediately. Suspension is nice and tight with a feel that inspires confidence, but in cold MN winters it gets a little rough. Drives like other European sedans (Audi A4, BMW 3 series). I did have some problems with rear driver's side door locks, but easily fixed. Did also have problem with fuel pump. Both would have been pricey, but I bought an extended warranty - which I would recommend. Minor finish issues also with driver's door console, but that was fault of prior owner. Gas mileage is a little low in the city, but on the freeway at 75 it still gets 30-32 MPG. Overall, it is a very fun car to drive, very sporty, looks nice w/spoiler, fairly reliable."
volvo,s40,2001,Anonymous, 07/16/2005,Adios!,3,"I just traded this car in for a Toyota after 10+ years of loyal Volvo ownership.  This is the worst car I have ever owned.  Meticulously maintained and the turbo blew at 50k, then the ignition coils, then the thermostat, and on and on.  Not on par with what a Volvo owner expects from a car.  It was cheap and it shows in every aspect of the car from the interior to the mechanical reliability.  I am so glad to be rid of this car."
volvo,s40,2001,V, 05/30/2006,We STILL love this car,4,"Fun to drive, great gas mileage, easy to park, as safe as the bigger Volvos... This car is fantastic. We've had it almost 5 years, and have NO interest in getting a replacement. Has been super reliable, versatile for a sedan (folding seats, etc.), and the lines are great. We also bought a V40 at the same time, and only sold it to get a bigger wagon. These cars are easy to love."

I would recomend this vehicle to anyone that loves the luxury of nice product but does not have the money to get a BMW/Merc"
volvo,s40,2001,jackbuc, 04/21/2003,Could be made better,3,"The car handles well, however, there 
are problems. One, the doors are way to

I will need brake pads after 15,000

Check engine has been on and off for the past year! Both cup holders have self-destructed! Very strange noises come from engine compartment.  Forget about holding coffee in the coffee cup holder because a) it will spill all over radio and console and b) it blocks radio and most of console controls."
volvo,s40,2001,ahirebet, 05/24/2007,Great Value for Money,4,"Excellent bang for the buck. I bought this certified pre-owned, so it came with a 6 year, 100,000 mile extended warranty. Even so, I only used that warranty once to fix a cracked ignition coil and all it cost me was a $50 deductible. Aside from that, the car has performed flawlessly in all four seasons. It rides and feels like the other european luxury sedans - heated leather seats, alloy wheels, sunroof, quiet interior etc, but at a much better price. The 1.9L turbo delivers plenty of zip without compromising highway mpg."

unexpected.  I also have been in to the 
dealer many more times than you would 
plan from a Volvo.  Mysterious check 
engine lights, tires and rims that need 
to be completely replaced after 
minor/small impacts with potholes.  The 
service department is always very nice,

Excellent value at that price.
Pretty good acceleration and handling, 
although the ride can be a bit stiff on 
irregular surfaces.  Engine a bit 
noisy at low (parking lot) speeds.  
Braking is excellent, although I agree 
with other reviewers that they wear 
down prematurely.  Well-designed 
interior; e.g. hook on 
the left passenger's side (on which to 
hang a jacket)is placed so that the 
blind spot is not obstructed.  Cruise

much less than the A4."
volvo,s40,2001,never again, 03/18/2008,Don't do it,1,This car was the biggest mistake I've made since my first marriage (and nearly as costly.) Constantly in need of repair and or maintenance. Everything from the sun roof to the brakes has needed attention. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the lights. Nearly $200 in bulbs in approximately 18 months! Can't finish without mentioning the cup holder - I seriously suspect is was designed by a team of monkeys. My recommendation to a prospective buyer is - don't.

volvo,s40,2001,car review, 05/25/2020,A Headache,2,"Bought the 2001 -2years ago- for 2500- nothing but a headache 5 min afterwards. Never buy a car from a shop (there for a reason)- former guy had extensive work done on it- but 5 min out the door- engine light comes on- shop should have never safetied it- bad rotors, bad bumper, pulsating break, right turn signal you have to hold while turning, shakes while idling at a stoplight- needed a $800 ""hub"" which was leaking on the timing belt, ON and ON - big problem was finding a guy to work on them- I was spoiled on my 1980-had a great mechanic- but for this one had this grouchy guy who overcharged me every chance he got. Hard to find parts- replaced front struts- but every 4 months -some type of 400-500$-800$ type problem. Never felt safe driving it- like some thing else was gonna fall apart. You can't get key out of ignition because it gets stuck so you have to fight with the shift in park to let it out. Luckily I found one Volvo lover in this small town who is buying it off my hands. It needs new front brakes again and right rear struts- not throwing another grand into this headache. Plus mechanic said it also needs a timing belt which a 2nd mechanic said it didn't... If I had found a good guy that works on them- it may have been different -but this guy is what gives mechanics a bad name.

volvo,s40,2002,nate91, 07/26/2012,Good Fun Car,4,"I really wanted a used BMW or Mercedes primarily because they were great handling rear-wheel drive cars. Hence I was hesitant to get another front-drive Volvo, but this car was in the price range. However, this car has exceeded my expectations.

The turbo makes for great power and great fun. Hit the gas hard and it peels out through first gear. You can easily get to any open spot in traffic even on the highway. Firm suspension makes for good handling but a bit of a bumpy ride. Like others said, it stops on a dime.
The cons. Cheap interior, I hate the cloth seats and door panels are loose. The car idles a bit rough, the steering wheel always shakes at lights."

We had an oil leak for 1.5 years that the dealers could not fix, thought it was RMS but started cheap (RMS is $2k) fixed the Camshaft Seal ($300). That didn't fix it Finally an independent shop found it was the turbo return line, not uncommon and a $100 fix. Otherwise, we have had no real problems. The A/C occasionally blows hot air, something also not uncommon. In general, reliable for us, comfortable and fun to drive. However, shop just told us it was very rare to see this car with 7 years and 80k plus miles without a roulette of engine lights. So maybe we got a good one..."

We both really love this car. It has a high quality, comfortable, safe-feeling ride with sporty handling."
volvo,s40,2002,Lynn, 03/15/2008,Volvo s40,4,"This is a fun car to drive. The gas mileage is decent. While a 4 dr sedan, there really is no leg room to speak of for adult passengers sitting in the back seat. I have cloth seats, and have had them cleaned twice in 2 years; even a water stain leaves a mark. Next time it's leather for me. Overall, a nice car for 1 or 2 adults."
volvo,s40,2002,cwhite, 11/12/2009,Let Down - Not what they used to be,2,"I have owned this vehicle for 4.5 years, purchased certified pre-owned and the 1st yr was great. This vehicle has soooo many mechanical blunders that when I look at it, I'm afraid it might need to go to the shop. I have invested atleast $6,500.oo or more in repairs and replaced tires twice. One dealership replaced parts on it that weren't required to fix the problem and I had it towed from the dealer to a small time mechanic who fixed the problem for 1/4 of the price. I could vent more about it but I'll save their face. I will not buy another Volvo."
volvo,s40,2002,Mary-C, 07/31/2002,Best Car I've Ever Had,5,"This is the best car I've ever had. I 
had a 2001 model but got into a sever 
accident only about 4 month after I had 
gotten in. The car was totaled but I 
only had a few scratches. I trust my 
car to keep me safe and other should 
too. The acceleration is one of the 
best things and the climate control 
feature is a great help. This is a 
great car for everyone, except maybe 
the extremely large person who might 
have some trouble getting in."
volvo,s40,2002,eragchaa, 02/05/2010,Not as much VOLVO quality,3,"Purchased 02 S40 with 60K miles on it, for my wife. This is great looking car, with turbocharger. Great acceleration, power for 1.9T engine. At 70K we had to replace TurboCharger, I did the job myself, bought the Turbo from eBay used one for 240$,saved about $900.At Volvo it would cost about 800$ for the part and $400 for installation.Then check engine light came up,had to replace thermostat,another check engine light had to replace ignition coil,spark plugs,at 80K had another check engine light,have to check it again. Tran fluid change is the ripoff at the dealer, for special VOLVO fluid $18per1/4. MPG is less then 01Camry. Overall not much for high end luxury car.Going for LEXUS next time"
volvo,s40,2002,whiffer, 10/13/2004,A truly awful car,2,"I am in the second year of a four-year lease and am 
getting out of it as soon as I can.  I've owned a lot 
of cars in my time; the S40 is the most 
uncomfortable, least driver-friendly car I've ever 
had.  The interior is cramped, the drive is noisy and 
flat, and the fittings are cheap.  If you have long 
legs (like I do), don't even think about the S40 -- 
you'll spend half of your drive getting up and 
stretching.  The rear seats have practically 
no legroom at all.  I've also had a lot of problems 
with reliability, specifically with the electrical 
system, and at times the CHECK ENGINE light 
comes on for no reason at all.  My advice: look 
somewhere else if you want a sedan."
volvo,s40,2002,o9utknrloi, 12/05/2002,Nothing but headaches,1,"I purchased the 2002 Volvo S40 in 
April.  3,000 miles later the car was 
stuck in park twice - two defective 
parts needed to be replaced.  At 10,000 
miles the power seats broke.  This car 
has been nothing but a headache and the 
disgusting customer service doesn't 
help either."
volvo,s40,2002,polzinbw, 07/17/2008,"Good Car, But Getting Expensive",4,"I agree with all of the positives others have written: nice ride, looks good, feels solid, nice features/bells/whistles for the price. However, after owning it now for just shy of 5 years (87,000 miles, bought used with 14k) it's starting to fall apart on me. Have replaced shocks/struts at 73,000 which seems early; put in a new power window motor around 75,000 ($600); the sunroof doesn't close quite all the way and leaks in a car wash sometimes; some small molding is coming apart around the trunk release; the alarm doesn't always turn on when I lock the car. Have done breaks twice now, too. And these repairs are expensive - this isn't a Honda or Toyota. Engine is supposed to be good though!"
volvo,s40,2002,unsatisfied owner, 04/17/2002,not so great car,3,"I have had problems with this car since 
I got it.  The check-engine light has 
come on at least four times and the car 
has stalled on me twice( once for a 
defective computer chip and the other 
time was because the oxygen hose came 
off), I took it in to the service 
center at the dealership and they've 
fixed it. This car has given more 
problems than it is worth (I'm trading 
it in for something better and more 
reliable), it's basically a defect."
volvo,s40,2002,Issa, 04/19/2002,disapointed,3,"Having no previous experience in 
leasing I have been talked into a 
lease at $ 369/month for four years 
and 2000 down. Comparing it to 
$299/month that someone else on 
this list is getting it seems very high. 
Have I been taken? Also the ride is 
very tough : feels like grinding the  
texture of the road. On highway I feel 
like jumping up and down as if in a 
toy car. Nothing like the smooth ride 
on my old Honda Accord."
volvo,s40,2002,Jester, 04/21/2002,Volvo S40,4,"I love this car. It drives really nice,

has gone above and beyond all of my 
expectations."

several times a month. Front & rear 
brakes replaced at 16k mis. Three 
dealers that I have been to do not 
spend time to diagnose the problems. 
Service is disappointing, especially 
for a luxury marque such as Volvo."

just my size, very comfortable, I 
haven't had any problems since I got 
it. It is a bit small for my husband 
though. I really like the features and 
safety, the car accelerates well, I get 
a good gas mileage."
volvo,s40,2002,Brendan Kelly, 05/13/2002,Not worth the $$$,3,"I have had this car for almost two 
years and have had it in the shop on at 
least 5 occasions due to manufacture 
defects.  True, I've had no serious 
problems, but after driving a Honda and 
Nissan into the ground with nary a 
problem, this is new territory for me.

I had to replace the brakes after only 
12,000 miles and Volvo tried to 
convince me that this is normal!

The 15K tune-up cost me almost $500. 
Since I'll exceed 45,000 during my 39 
month lease, I'll have to pay almost 
$1,500 to have the tires rotated and 
the filters replaced."
volvo,s40,2002,Joejoe, 05/15/2002,get an accord,2,"Although this car comes with the emblem 
of volvo there is not much else to love 
about it.  From a cup holder that does 
not allow you to pull out your 
CD's,windows that whistle when you 
raise them to a check engine light that 
comes on if you don' tighten the gas 
cap three turns past the end.  I had to 
replace the steering column and breaks 
after 10,000 miles.  I wish I had 
leased a Honda Accord."
volvo,s40,2002,Aaron1, 05/21/2002,Great European Automobile,5,"My wife and I purchased our 2001 S40 
in September and have very much 
enjoyed owning it.  The 1.9L turbo 
charged engine provides great 
acceleration and the ride quality of 
the S40 is very smooth, even over 
rough surfaces.  The service light 
issue, many other reviews have 
mentioned, was easily fixed by a 
recall from Volvo and a quick software 
upgrade to the cars internal 
computer.  The S40s relatively low 
price and long list of standard 
features offers BMW's 3 Series and 
Audi's A4 solid competition in the 
upscale entry-level sedan realm.  The 
passenger compartment of the S40 is 
well-finished and its large trunk 
provides ample cargo capacity."
volvo,s40,2002,18yearolddriver, 05/21/2002,A mistake,2,"With no added options, not even a CD 
player, the car came with nothing.  100 
watts of sound is barely enough to 
drown out the loud engine and the 
sounds of the road.  You can hear 
everything on the road, and everyone 
can hear the sound coming from your 
car.  Very thin doors.  Poor placement 
of cup holders, and they are square.  
Since when are cups square?  Many 
problems: brakes, tires, steering 
wheel, wipers (headlight and 
windsheild), and the windshield itself. 
Weak body is prone to little dings that 
occur with everyday driving.  Gas and 
brake pedals too close to each other!"
volvo,s40,2002,RJONES, 05/28/2002,S40,5,"I FIND THIS TO BE AN EXCELLENT VEHICLE 
FOR THE PRICE.  DRIVING IS FUN AND VERY

SAFETY FEATURES, IN PARTICULAR, THE 
WHIPLASH PROTECTION SYSTEM AND 6 
AIRBAGS."
volvo,s40,2002,kurt ericsson, 06/01/2002,Not so Happy,4,"I have replaced brakes at 12,000 miles, 
and was told by volvo this is normal.  
Light bulbs are constantly out amd head 
and tail lights are also constantly 
going out.  Many idiot lights coming on 
on the dash board.  Great car to drive, 
but very quirky, and has been to the 
dealer for service on a monthly basis.  
I would not recommend."
volvo,s40,2002,koj, 06/10/2002,2000 Volvo S40,4,"I have been very happy with my 2000 S40 
overall.  I bought it brand new in 
December, 1999.  It rides very well, 
although I think it could use a little 
more leg room.  I've had to have the 
radio/CD player replaced.  Also, the 
windshield wiper dispenser on the hood 
leaks, which cause some discoloring on 
the paint.  I bought the very first 
model her in the US, so I've had 
several little thinngs occur which have 
all been under warranty.  Lesson 
learned, I will not buy another Volvo 
model it's first year in release, or 
any other car for that matter."
volvo,s40,2002,MDB, 08/27/2009,No Longer Happy!,4,"Chose Volvo for safety and supposed longevity. Generally agree with comments of satisfied owners, though have had some of the problems -- lamp bulbs and brake pads. Owned the car for 7 years, yet only 58,000 miles, so expected at least a couple of more years w/o major repairs. Surprise! Last week my wife drove home from work, and upon arrival stated that something was really wrong with the car.  Wheels very hot; towed to dealer; week later Volvo area expert determined that ABS pump failed, entire brake system damaged; repair cost $2800. Have followed all recommended servicing; most recent visit no brake problems noted. Dealer service has been very good, yet we will not buy another Volvo!"

prior to buying this vehicle.  For the 
money this is an excellent choice of a 
European made car.  My performance has 
been nothing but excellent. The day 
after I purchased it we took it on a 
long business trip (300 miles) and it 
was super to ride in and fun to drive. 
The folks at Volvo listened to those 
who complained. Cup holders have been 
moved and the service light problem 
fixed."

have are only so/so gas mileage (compared to my previous car, anyway), the  
box on the center console is about 1/4 inch too small to put CD cases into 
and the radio reception is not great (my car came with the upgraded stereo 
with CD)."
volvo,s40,2002,Mike and Erin, 11/02/2002,2001 S40 Review,4,"We bought a Volvo S40 late 2001. At 
12,000 miles, the steering wheel 
started shaking when braking. Since 
then the Volvo dealer has replaced the 
entire braking system 4 times.  They 
even escalated the problem to Volvo 
headquarters.  It was really 
frustrating for both us and the 
dealership.  I have to admit, the 
dealership gets an A+ through all of 
this.  They are buying the car back 
from me, and putting me into a new S60 
for my troubles.  I have never seen a 
dealership show concerned with making 
us happy.  Nonetheless, we paid $30k 
for a car that was in the shop once a 
month. Which is why they were quick to 
get me out of the car."
volvo,s40,2002,Markkor, 05/09/2003,2002 s40 review,5,"This a fun car to drive with adequate 
power and very good gas mileage.  
Nothing beats Volvo seats for comfort 
and protection. The radio and air cond. 
work fine. I like the trip computer and 
the sunroof. The ride is smooth but a 
little noisy from the air at the 
windows.  Transmision is generally 
smooth except when slowing down to a 
stop. I use regular gas."
volvo,s40,2002,valeriec, 05/21/2004,Worst Mistake I Made,1,"This car and the service from Volvo

car for two years and lately it's 
spending more time in the garage then 
driving it.  As for Volvos cutomer 
service, they don't know the meaning.  
The Cutomer Service Depatment asked if 
we expected them to service all the 
cars they sell.  The service manager 
said to me ""Looking forward to hearing 
about your next problem"".  Word of 
advice don't buy a Volvo.  Their slog 
should be ""Volvo for a lifetime of 
headaches""  Also the trade value of a 
two year old Volvo is extremely low,  
as I found out when I got rid of the

I've never owned any other car that had a driver seat with a spirit like that. Resale is terrible on this car.  Tired of being asked by the Dealership,  Will you give us a 10 for service?

I agree that my driver seat tips forward when you brake and back when you step on the gas. It's minor, but it is a unique feeling.  I am a bit concerned about the quality given that my door latch on the exterior rear passenger door no longer works and the locking fuel door sometime has to manually unlatched from inside the trunk.

Our ONLY gripe about it is the small size of the back seat.Fine for kids, small for adults. safe, reliable, fast, fun affordable- AND its a volvo, so I am counting on my 10 yr old is taking this car to college!!"
volvo,s40,2002,marmot, 04/01/2002,"nice, but not perfect",4,"considered this car b/c of volvo's reputation for safety and positive reviews.  bought b/c volvo offers such good deals on demos.  if not for the good deal, i would've bought a vw jetta with 1.8l turbo. the S40 runs and handles very well, but i'm often cursing the cockpit features.  turbo is fun, but sucks gas. thought my next car would be an S60, but will probably look closer at passat and lexus."
volvo,s40,2003,Ray, 08/01/2009,A Great Car,5,"It handles great, good quality, gas mileage superb--36mpg on a 1000 mile hilly trip through VA,WV,and OH with the cruise set at 70 and 3 adults.  I love the turbo and the fact that the cruise never kicks out on long steep grades and provides good acceleration when needed.  I don't understand the other reviewer's problems with brakes. Mine are still the original.  I get 39 mpg driving a back and forth over an 80mi (160) stretch over the Blue Ridge Mts.  I love the computer mpg meter giving instantaneous and avg mpg.  The other features (heated seats, pockets in front of seat base) are nice.  Overall a great little car. It could use a little more floor room for rear occupants. "
volvo,s40,2003,Sheri Ann Johnson, 08/03/2008,Love my 2003 S40,4,"I purchased my 2003 S40 in 07 with only 4600 miles on it. Ultimately a new car! I couldn't be happier with it. It's quick to get out the way & handles nicely, especially in the Florida rains. I do wish the back seat had more room for passengers, but it's a great excuse to get out of driving! I feel safe driving, especially at night. I've had no major issues, replaced a headlight & put on a new set of Michelins. I'll definitely replace it with another Volvo."
volvo,s40,2003,Student Lee, 10/11/2002,:thumbs up:,4,"I was trying to decide on whether I 
should buy a new S40, new A4, or new 
325i.  Just by looking at hp/curb 
weight or tq/curb weight, the S40 is 
way ahead of the two.  It beats both 
the A4 and 325i in torque (a fat 
torque band) while weighing in at 
under 2800lbs, while the other two are 
above 3200lbs.  This makes a HUGE 
difference.  Although this car is 
obviously not aimed at being a 
performance vehicle, it still handles 
well.  The 325i or A4 may beat the S40 
in an AutoX course (325 being FR and 
A4 being awd), but it really doesn't 
matter since this car will not be 
raced.  I just wanted a sensible car 
that drives and looks nice."
volvo,s40,2003,zackyson, 04/06/2008,The Lilttle Engine That Could,4,"What a super little car, I've owned other Volvos, but this is amazing built. Outstanding throttle response for such a prize machine. Imagine driving from Torrance, Ca to San Diego, Ca on ten dollars worth of gas in 2008! Wow! I love this car, my Cayanne S was fast, but nothing compared to this little speed demon. Thanks a lot Sweden."
volvo,s40,2003,Eric T., 02/27/2006,S40 Exceeds Expectations,4,"My S40 began life as a RENTAL CAR, and 30k miles later, I purchased it. Why this car? Initially because of its value, reputation, style, & service competency at the dealership. I haven't had a single problem with my car. I commute 50 comfortable miles r/t daily, and get 30+mpg. I've never struggled to merge into fast moving traffic. I keep it clean, change the oil myself, and monitor fluid levels and tire pressure/wear. Volvo has higher value over time, and is safer than most other cars on the road. When I want 'performance' acceleration/handling/braking, I'll put on my helmet and leathers, and head for a track day on my superbike. My car is more than competent at what I expect from a car."
volvo,s40,2003,jeffj-nj, 08/05/2003,Near the top of this Valet's list.,4,"700 characters is just NOT enough room

valet, so I've driven, oh, about 
everything. That said, there is nothing 
on the road today offering this 
cost/quality ratio. Everything about 
the car is just so... right. I had 
originally prepared a several paragraph 
essay about this, but I can't post 
it or even figure out what to cut 
from it. So, I'll sum it up with this: 
I've put 25k miles on this car, and 
enjoyed every one of them. 
Considering several hundred of them 
were accumulated in one sitting, and/or 
during the worst winter NJ has seen in 
some time, that's really saying quite a 
bit. If you're looking elsewhere, stop."

was hesitant to purchase after reading 
several reviews of earlier versions of 
this car. In my opinion, the 2003 S40 
is one of the best values on the 
road.  I had previously decided to 
replace my old Accord with a newer 
version but was turned off by the 
pricing on the EX model when I went in 
to purchase.  I found the S40 to be 
far more luxurious and fun to drive 
than the Accord for about the same 
price (actually less for a certified 
used vehicle).  The car is zippy and 
extremely comfortable, and I love the 
fact that it is far less common on the 
roadways than the old standbys Accord 
and Camry.  I would definitely 
recommend this vehicle to anyone!  "
volvo,s40,2003,Daniel Fickenscher, 06/03/2017,03 Volvo s40,5,"Great car, all the fixes have been simple and cheap. The only issues are with interior headliner dropping and buttons are sticky due to ""soft rubber"" deterioration.

volvo,s40,2003,Marco, 04/23/2005,Most disappointing car ever,3,"When I was shopping for a car back in 02, I chose the Volvo S40 after looking at the Acura RSX, Saab 93, and Audi A4.  Ultimately, I picked the Volvo because it seemed luxurious, the dealer promised that this was a 'performance' car, and I had the Ford Aplan discount, which made it the cheapest of the bunch.  Oops.  What a disaster of a car.  To be fair, I think that Volvo just has no idea how to make a small car.  The 'performance' is a joke.  The handling is ponderous and, at highway speeds, can be a little scary.  When passing at high speeds, the car wobbles -- literally.  The braking is AWFUL. The nose dips and the car takes too long to stop.  Would not recommend this car.  "
volvo,s40,2003,Spatwardhan, 10/27/2002,Overall,4,"I've enjoyed the car.  Except, I find 
little annoyances with the DSA light

annoying as well."

chech engine light on at least 6 x's,

the car for 8 months and it is a joy to 
drive.  Plenty of acceleration, good 
handeling, comfortable, very secure in 
bad weather, economical, reduced 
insurance and no gimics.  The model is 
to be replaced mid-year 2004, so watch 
for good discounts as Volvo does."

Who ever heard of rear brake pads only lasting 12 to 15 thousand miles. Volvo claims this is normal wear for our pads and that there is no problems with the braking system. I have also replaced the front pads once they seem to hold better. I have also had other miscelanious problems i.e. bad fuel injectors replaced, gas gauge replaced, and several light bulbs. Overall this car has not been a very pleasant experience and I can't wait to get out of my lease."

Still on original Michelin tires after 43k miles. Drives as well as it did in Nov 2002, smoothly yet with pep if needed. Recommended maintenance done by non-dealer Volvo-only shop for reasonable price. Even my BMW-3-series-owning friends enjoy riding in it with me."

the comfort for the driver.  I do not 
like the wheel adjuster for the 
passenger seat.  For me this is really 
a two person car because the front 
passengers are EXTREMELY comfy.  The 
rear ones are just ok. Also, what 
happened to a trunk light?  I'm on 
nearly 30k miles in less than a year, 
no problems with the car at all.

12/00 with the expectation that we 
would have a baby before the end of the

however the addition of our daughter 
has changed our feelings towards the 
S40. It is simply not large enough for 
two adults and one baby. With the baby 
seat in the rear-facing position behind 
the passengers' seat, my wife has to 
move the passengers' seat almost all of 
the way forward, which is obviously not 
comfortable. Also, we had to replace

a rear rotor due to a factory defect.  
During the second year with 10,000 
miles on the car I needed new rear 
rotors and brake pads costing close to 
$500.  I am currently fighting with 
Volvo to reimburse me.  During the 
second year the shift light blew out, 
the front headlight had to be replaced, 
the power seat broke and needed a new 
switch, the steering colum needed 
repairs.  The check engine light goes 
on and off continously, and the air

of BMW 3-series (both of which can 
actually be cheaper than the S40 since 
I have yet to see an S40 that didn't 
come with all of the options). However, 
after purchasing this car I would never 
want one of the others. This car is 
incredibly comfortable inside and Volvo 
has paid attention to all of the little 
details. In past years this car may not 
have had some problems, but Volvo seems 
to have worked them all out now. 
Definitely a great buy, especially if

volvo,s40,2003,StuartL., 02/20/2003,Yes it is a Volvo but.....,3,"Got a great deal on a demo model 
with exactly the features that I 
wanted.  People in the dealership 
are great and not stuckup like Audi 
and BMW.  Given Volvo's reputation 
for building sturdy, dependable cars I 
have been surprised by the need for 
new break pads every 20K and the 
high maintanence costs. "

Volvo--it's for Life, really it is!!"

cant be beat the 03s are now going for 
around 21-22K fully equipped with 
premium and climate packages.  Its a 
well made automobile thats FUN to 
drive.  I just wish it had a little 
more room in the rear I guess thats 
what the S60 is for but 4 fit fine for 
a 2 hr trip.  Any more I dont know Im 
never out of the drivers seat.  "

have never owned a Volvo.  I've never
owned a Mitsubishi product.  I've never
owned a car built in Holland.  One
purchase covered all of those voids.  
That said, the car is well built, and
gutsy.  It's my wife's driver and she
loves it.  My only complaint with the
car is that the 4 cylinder is a little
noisy.  But I've driven few 4 cylinders
that didn't sound like sewing machines."
volvo,s40,2003,Siddiqui, 07/06/2003,Great Car for the Price,5,"I have bought this car 2 weeks ago, 
and I love it, This car is quick.With 
Ford Xplan and $4500 incenticve it is 
a true bargain, I am waiting to see 
how it handles in the winter, I opted 
for sports and climate package with 
Moonroof. I have read people have some 
problems in 2000 and 2001 models but i 
think there are all fixed in 2003. I 
have checked A4 and VW Passat but they 
were too pricey as compared to S40."
volvo,s40,2004,greatpurchase, 09/17/2010,bragging rights- great performance,4,"From the moment I test drove this car I loved it. The acceleration blew me away, not to mention the handling. I drove off the lot 2 hours later. 0-60 in a blink of an eye..I leave the competition in the dust. Handling, finish, reliability. My Favorite features are the rain drop/auto wipe feature,heated seats,audio system. Volvo got it right on this one."
volvo,s40,2004,John, 07/22/2010,This car can save your life,4,"I bought this car for my teenage daughter, in part because of its safety features. Within months she was involved in a serious rollover accident (swerved to avoid a deer) and the car came to rest on its roof. The car was totaled. Looking at the car afterward I would have believed it was a fatal accident, but she did not have a scratch!  If safety is paramount to you, you can count on this car - it saved my daughter's life."
volvo,s40,2004,Luis H, 04/17/2010,T5 is very unique and great power,4,T5 engine is a must have. got it in red and is very good overall. still looks like new almost 6 years later. 1st few months was a rear brake grinding noise that took several visits to replace. Then the sunroof molding kept coming off. turbo valve had to be replaced. 2 years ago my oil trap had to be replaced at about 75K miles. Dealership and Volvo denied this was an issue. Cost $600. 3 months later my wife's 2005 T5 s40 had the same problem at around 75K miles but volvo still denied this was an issue or a recall. 2 exact cars w/ the same issue at around 75K owned by same family on long island not an issue????? 3months later recall issued. now both cars have water leaks when it rains
volvo,s40,2004,Jammer, 05/15/2003,At this price it a no brainer!!!!!!!!!,5,"  My wife and I just recently purchased 
our S40 and are quite impressed.  The 
ride and comfort is just great!  After 
driving SUV's and truck's for the past 
5 yrs it is a relief to find a vehicle 
with accelleration, fuel ecomony, and

 Anyone looking at a SAAB 9-3, Audi A4,

been very impressed by.  I am now 
middle aged and therefore have been 
required to go for a sensible car.  My 
Honda Accord TypeR had to go and I have 
to be a grown up :-( Enter an S40 T5 so 
much torque, quiet (great news after 
the Honda) 30mpg at 90mph  I love this 
car. Even running in, resticted to 
3000rpm, you are traveling at 90+ but 
as the milage goes on (now at 1100 in 
10 days) the engine gets better and 
better. The 6 speed gearbox is smooth 
and precise, better even than the Honda 
with it's award winning box, even if 6 
speeds are unnessisary with the car."
volvo,s40,2004,Michael, 03/14/2008,Performance Bargain,5,"I've been driving this car for about a month and I love it.  It makes my commute enjoyable instead of it being a drudgery.  The Volvo S40 handles like it's on rails, stuck to the road like glue.Really comfortable. The car feels so solid and well built.  The 5 cylinder engine has a surprising amount of power.  It really takes off when you punch the accelerator, and yet, fuel economy is better than my Honda Accord.  I'm averaging about 32 mpg on the highway. I wish I had bought this car a long time ago!"
volvo,s40,2004,FtLauderdale, 12/14/2007,First and Last Volvo,2,"I'm not a big fan of this car and anxiously await the end of the lease. It's just not reliable enough, something is always going wrong and the service people act like they're doing you a big favor to fix it, even warrantly items that just should not be a problem so soon. With that scenario, rattles, wind noise, and poor gas mileage (22 mpg), I'll be looking elsewere for my next ride."
volvo,s40,2004,jece, 08/24/2003,Lg families and lg egos need not apply,4,"In a nutshell:Solid value and 
understated elegance.  
If you want a sportscar or something 
to ""show,"" perhaps you should look to 
BMW or Jaguar. 
This car offers every safety feature 
imaginable, its reliable, and the power 
of the turbo engine is more than 
adequate. Standard equipment far 
exceeds anything Audi or the Japanese 
have to offer. This is my second s40 as 
the s60 was a bit large for what I was 
looking for.  No problems ever.  Highly 
recommended-however, not for large 
families or large egos."

I bought the car with 75,000 miles on it and it had a bad compresser, and a blown amp.. My cd player had  to be replaced... All the Major belts have had to be replaced twice.. The care also stinks on gas! I do not think this is a reliable car, and very disappointed in Volvo.. Havent had the car a year yet and im already in the process of getting a new car... Not recommended!"

had to return to the dealership.  To

umpteen headlights.  I saw the service

very good looking. She says she fields 
safe in it and it is speedy. The seats 
are my favorite I could sleep for days

Mistral Green is beautiful and the fit 
& finish are excellent.  Safety is my 
main concern and this car line has it 
all standard.  The center control is 
like a remote-and there is so much you 
can program.  I never have to turn 
on/off my lights-it does it 
automatically!  The engine is 
responsive and great on fuel.  I will 
be travelling a great deal and I needed 
the safety features that I would have 
had to pay extra for with a different 
vehicle (not a Volvo).  Drive it-you 
won't regret it."

The 170hp turbo has plenty of power and the 5-speed automatic is great.  This is one of the best cars I have ever owned.  I currently have 33k miles on it.  This car has features like auto climate control and heated seats that are usually only found on larger vehicles.  They put synthetic oil in from the factory so you only have to go back for an oil change every 7,500 miles.  This car is also very fun to drive and it handles the road like a champ."
volvo,s40,2004,btp, 07/11/2005,S40 Good but could be so much better...,3,I have driven the car on long trips as well as used it as a commuter and the driver comfort is excellent as are the interior features.  My S40 is the 5spd manual non-T5 yet I LOVE the responsiveness and handling of the car in all types of weather - and the good mileage! (way better than auto-trans).  I got the winter mats (a must for a New England winter) and had the dealer install - those little buttons that hold the mats in place REALLY should be fastened better.  The other nag is that I get intermittent wind noise/whistle from somewhere in back.  I dread the first rattle - PLEASE dont be a Ford and rattle after 30k miles!  -the fuses for the 12volt were dead when I bought it...bummer.  
volvo,s40,2004,smokeone, 10/04/2003,Fantastic Ride,4,"So far it is fantastic!  We wanted a 
car with loads of safety features, but 
we also like quick and sporty.  The S40 
is all of the above and really not much 
more expensive than the competitors, 
considering the great build quality."
volvo,s40,2004,Mr.Garza, 03/01/2004,Volvo S40 LSE AS R,4,"Overall a great car. Going to 
Grossinger Volvo in Lincolnwood, 
Illinois was a hassle, they have a 
terrible service center, and when we 
terminated a lease of a 2000 Toyota 
Camry XLE they lost the keys, manual 
to the car and never returned it on 
time(recieved bills from toyota).  
Great car for the money.  It would 
have been better if they had told us 
about the new redesigned 2004.5 Volvo 
S40.  The service is terrible they 
don't know the parts of the car, they 
don't know how to fix problems with 
the car(squeking noise when braking), 
and they don't know which car you own, 
last time they brought us the wrong 
car!!!Don't go to Grossinger!!!"

performace is outstanding and easily 
outclasses the competition in the price 
range.  The styling is great, it looks 
nothing like the Volvos of old.  Also 
the gas milage is great given this is a 
high performace car.  Volvo has 
definitely built a winner of a car and 
attracted a new audience."

well.  It isn't a S60 but for the size 
of the vehicle it performs just as

roadside assistance and maintenance

when someone hit me from the rear.  I 
went to many different dealerships 
Honda, Acura, Subaru, VW, etc.  I just 
thought I would stop into the Volvo 
dealership to see what they had.  They 
made me a deal I couldn't refuse on a 
2004 S40.  It has everything except fog 
lights and a spoiler.  The only 
complaint I have is that the steering 
wheel vibrates a little when traveling 
above 70Mph."
volvo,s40,2004,KC PLAZA BUM, 10/08/2003,BUYER BEWARE,4,"I really like my car, however, the 
paint is severely oxidizing on the top 
panels.  Volvo North America's 
representative would not even look at 
my car saying it was not covered.  The 
finish is dull and must be waxed 
everytime the car is exposed to bad 
weather or washed.  I would look at 
other comparable cars.  The yearly 
maintenence on this car is expensive.  
Oil change is $75.00, 1st service at 
15,000 miles will run $250.00 and the 
30,000 mile is just over $500.00.  I 
also needed to replace my brakes at 
25,00 miles for $500.00.  Volvo uses 
very soft pads, your alloy wheels will 
always be covered in brake dust a day 
or so after washing your car.  "

My wife was driving the vehicle on the Autobahn but there was a stau or traffic jam, well she stopped but the car hit her from the back at 90 mph, my son and wife were not harmed at all, just headaches.  If it was any other car I don't think that my family would have made it.  Volvo is the best, even though your not expecting an accident.  Atleast you know that Volvo is built quality."

The class of Volvo, the turbo makes this car fun to drive. I drive my company car until it has 80,000 miles then get another. By the time the cars get 80,000 miles they are tired and I'm glad to see them go. But not my Volvo. At 80K it runs, looks, and drives as nice as the day I got it. I love this car. I have never wanted to keep my company car until now. I liked this car so much I got my wife a Volvo S80 Certified car and she loves hers. The dealer is wonderful, they treat you like royalty."

was at a minimum, CD-radio system was 
reliable, braking was excellent, and 
the adjustable seats were key to a 
comfortable ride.  My purchase

well below invoice price at around 
$22k.  This is an excellent value for

From the second you see the new S40 you
realize this isn't your mother's Volvo.
 It has
a much more aggressive look than their
other sedans (much more so than their
older S40s), especially with the sport
package.  The interior is just as nice.

They have changed the navigation system
controls for the better.  The driver now
has more of a joystick on the wheel to
cycle through options, which makes it SO
easy to use.  There is also still a
remote control."

far the only issue i have with it is 
when storing two specific stations in

volvo,s40,2004,Tareyece & Eric, 05/04/2004,2004.5 Very Nice Car,4,"I love to drive, and have been a solid 
VW fan. But the Volvo S40 with the 
turbo, it takes the experience to a new 
level. 

The handling is far above average in 
rain or dry pavement and the pick-up is 
fabulous. 

The interior is well thought out and 
does not have lots of redudndcies, 
every button or dial performes a 
necassary function and often pull 
double duty. 

The space, for me, is very roomy and 
the seatys are very comfortable. The 
trunk is quite large and has an 
excellent capacity.

All around, this is a pleasure to drive."
volvo,s40,2004,lkw15, 05/16/2004,Fantastic Car,5,"This car has been fantastic so far.  
The gas mileage is excellent, the ride 
is smooth, the acceleration is quick.  
With the premium package and climate 
package, this car comes loaded for a 
price right around high 25,000's, low 
26's.  I commute a long distance each 
day and this car has been a pleasure 
to ride in.    "

twice as far from home as her previous 
one and our youngest son got his 
license.  With the price of gas, it 
was time to get rid of the minivan and 
look for something more fuel 
efficient.  We weren't even planning 
on looking at the Volvo, but it 
happened to be the first dealer we 
passed.  We didn't get any further.  
The car is great.  You can't beat the 
design, sportyness, power, safety 
features, and the fun to drive factor 
for the price.  She loves it and has 
been averaging 29mpg.  I had my heart 
set on a BMW 3-series, but there's no 
competition.  The S40 is by far the 
superior car."

with this thing.  This is my second 
Volvo , 850 turbo was the first, a 
better car but Ford didn't own them 
then. They are currently replacing the 
whole emission system. At least the 
dealer Buys back or replaces which is 
where I am at the moment."

the best seats ever!! OK low-end power,

impressive.  Comfortable on long trips 
and stable at high (75-90) speeds.  
Great ergonomics and a good sound 
system.  Constantly gets compliments  
most people think its a $40,000+ car.  
She test drove the BMW, Audi A4, Nissan

responsive ride. I got the sports 
package and the premium sound and I'm 
really glad I got both. In particular, 
I find the aluminum to look much better

number of little things I'd like to see

Trunk, under seat, and glove box 
mounted changers are antiquated. I 
have had cars that claimed to be 
sports cars that cost twice as much

get a lot more car for your money compared

Premium Package/Sound, Convenience.
I chose the 2.4i because I didn't feel 
the T5 was $3K faster, meaning the 
2.4i has some good enough zip for me. 
As most others have written, you are 
saving quite a few bucks when choosing 
the S40 over the TSX, A4 or C230. I 
came down to the Acura TSX and the 
S40. I paid about $2K less, 
understanding the great reliability 
history of Acura. At the end of the 
day I felt Acura is a small Accord 
with a sport package. As for the A4 
and C230, both were great cars but 
were about $5K more. I would not have 
considered the old S40 nor the current 
S60, but the new 2004.5 S40) is a

will be astounded and amazed. I was. I 
mean after all, it's a Volvo. The 
brand's not exactly the spicest salsa 
on the shelf. Yet, this car has the 
horsepower and acceleration of a BMW 
330 and A4 3.0 for thousands less. The 
interior is innovative and clean, while 
torque steer is negligble. And during 
the winter months you'll laugh at all 
those ""rear wheel drive"" snobs stuck in 
a snow bank. The brakes are sure 
stopping, and it's safer than a pillow.

piece of machinery."
volvo,s40,2004,dargorilla, 07/28/2004,What a ride!,5,"I just got my new T5 two weeks ago, 
and I have to say that this is one 
serious automobile.  The acceleration 
numbers that you read in the magazines 
(0-60 in 6.5 secs) just do not do this 
car justice, and cannot covey 
the feeling of doing 35mph, putting 
your right foot on the floor, and 
watching 70 come up before you can 
even take a breath.  The ride and 
steering with the sport suspension 
feels stable even at ridiculous speeds 
through twisting turns.  The seats are 
comfortable and supportive, and the 
interior is stylish, and inviting.  
This is the perfect car for those of 
us that do not want to sacrifice 
performance, but need to haul 
around the rug rats."
volvo,s40,2004,jonR, 07/28/2004,Good Deal and unique,4,"Just bought the car yesterday for 
about 1100 under invoice.  We had a 
sudden need for another car and wanted 
something economical that still had a 
little panache. Looked at Hondas, 
Toyotas, et cetera. We've had a couple 
of BMWs including a competing 3 
series.  I don't really expect the 
same level of performance, comfort, or 
resale but the Volvo was about $10K 
less and I just think it has cool - 
unique (perhaps a little quirky) 
styling. I am expecting to like it 
very much and give it to my 13 year 
old daughter in a few years.

car.  The service at Warren Henry in

that had been stripped in order to

the driver's side pillar, though
normally it doesn't. Noticed a very
slight squeek when coming to stop, not
sure if it's brakes.  I also considered
the Acura TSX and also came down to
styling, TSX looks too much like an
Accord, the dealer wasn't very friendly,
nor would they respond to my email

friendly, not pushy and were willing to
negotiate via email."

love the leather and the wood inlay.  
The floating console is really cool

I love that too.  At first I doubted 
getting the color because my last few 
cars were green, but this color is 
beautiful and it looks great in the 
sun.  The sports package is great.  I 
drove both the 2.4i and the T5 and the 
acceleration was negligable to me, so I 
didn't feel it was worth the extra 
money to get the T5.  This car is

that it's a Volvo.  The commute is smooth and

The 2.4 has plenty of get up and go, and I love the looks it gets from others, I have had several people stop and ask me about it.

As a result, it has been in the shop more than any car I have ever owned.  The transmission sometimes kicks hard when it shifts and the dealer keeps telling me this is normal.  This car gets pretty bad ratings from Consumer Reports, something I wish I would have checked before buying.  My warranty will run out soon and I will definitely trade it when when it does.  I doubt I will buy another Volvo because of the mechanical issues.  My wife's Toyota is much more reliable and more than likely I will trade my car for a Toyota when the time comes."

We have owned a few Volvos in the past (240, 850) and this one is by far the coolest (beats the stodgy S60 and S80 designs by a mile). It is peppy, even our 2.4i, gets good mileage, 32/22, and handles great, even in the snow. We are in MN and had two major storms this year. I popped the car in manual mode and plowed right out of 1-foot snow drifts, while our Camry bottomed out and got stuck several times. Great car. "

are 1st Class.  The small things I did 
not like about my 2000 such as location 
of window and mirror controls and cup 
holders have been improved greatly.  
The car also has a 5 speed automatic 
now and is much smoother and quiter. 
Some slight body changes make the car 
better than the 2000 model.  A great

I love the eye catching ""Virtual Blue"" color. The turbo is great and it's got good pick- up. My $11k went far and I know this car will last me just like my last one did. I love the aggressive look of the front end and the rims. My complaints are like most everyone else's...the radio is ridiculous. The knobs to control the presets are just awkward. A ""popping"" trunk release would have been nice as well. I rated reliability at an 8 but I haven't had the car long. I base this on previous Volvo experience."

I still love getting in to it twice a day for a 30 mile commute.
The fuel economy is tough to beat, averaging 32MPG.

However, it is fussy and likes to be babied to avoid issues.
My fuel pressure sensor failed, causing tremendous ride issues, but no error code was generated, therefore the dealer threw up their hands at the issue, and wanted $450 parts/labor to replace it.
The part is $50 on Amazon.com, and takes 1 hour to install.

Performance- no, it is not a BMW 3 series but it does 80% of what the BMW does for $10,000 less (compared with same options).  Ride is a bit harsh.

Reliability- flawless since I got it... until recently.  Ignition switch, engine motor mount, engine speed sensor all failed at once.  Parasitic draw from trunk wiring 2 months prior to that.

Running costs- expensive (more on that below)"
volvo,s40,2005,volvodrvr2, 09/18/2014,LOVE this car!,4,"I bought this car used a year and a half ago and after much debate while searching for a car, I am still 100% in love with my S40. The ""high"" maintenance bills (it did need the timing belt replaced for being over 100k - $700) and ""Volvo"" stigma were intimidating at first, but now that I've had the car I know it was still a solid choice. It's got all the features I wanted, gets good gas mileage and is a great looking car. 30k on it in my year and a half of ownership (now 135k) and it still runs like a champ!"
volvo,s40,2005,harry, 03/29/2017,Some important issues to be aware of,2,"There is a known design defect where, if the sunroof drains that run down the doors of the car clog, water drains into the interior of the car from the lower part of the doors.  Absolutely ridiculous.  You need to regularly clear the drains with compressed air.  My interior is ruined as a result of water damage. 

Also, 2005 models don't come with an auxiliary jack or bluetooth, and you can't put an aftermarket CD player in.  You're looking at around $1000 to replace the CD player at the dealership if something goes wrong.  

It also seems the only problems I've had with the car required me to go to the dealership for repairs.

I have had it almost a year now, and it has almost 100,000 miles on it and it is just as great as the day I drove it off the lot. It handle's great on country roads, and even better on interstate's which is where I usually drive. It gets a combined average 25 MPG. I use 93 octane (premium) fuel and it seems to get better gas milage. I haven't had any problems out of this car! It has been a great car, and look forward to driving it for another 10 years. Just had an oil chage, new brakes, tires, and detailed, and it is good as new! I have never had any trouble out of this car! It's an amazing car!"

They all had minimal issues, and 2 of them are still running with their new owners. At 50K miles, this Volvo began having a myriad of issues. I spent over $6K fixing it, and finally gave up. I had to replace the Dashboard A/C vents, the A/C compressor, the ceiling carpet, the brakes, both engine mounts, among other things. I finally gave up! The quality and reliability of this vehicle is horrible enough to make me never want to buy a Volvo again. Buyer beware if you plan"
volvo,s40,2005,Carrie, 06/06/2010,Expensive to fix,4,"I love how this car drives, and that it feels safe.  However, just like the other reviews I have had several issues with this car.  Several recalls, after 3 years the A/C broke and will cost an astronomical amount to fix.  It blows hot air in summer, but it doesn't need a recharge.  Engine blew at 88K, since it was past its warranty Volvo said too bad.  It was their fault as they missed the oil leak that wore out the timing belt and thus broke the pistons in the engine.  Word to the wise, save all of your maintenance records if you buy this car, as Volvo will surely look at it if you try to dispute a malfunction and they keep horrible records. Good Luck if you buy this one!"
volvo,s40,2005,CB, 03/09/2016,05 s40 is a money pit,2,"Ive had a slew of issues and high cost repairs on this car. From struts, to transmission issues, gear module, etc. Every car needs service, what makes Volvo ""special"" is it takes a Volvo specialist to make necessary repairs and usually at high cost. A 2 yr lease is probably the way to go if you desire a Volvo, purchasing one will be a forever quest in high cost maintenance.

One thing never, never, never, go to the dealer for service or problems. Volvo dealers are scam artists! I have a local mechanic who does all my maintenance and does better work for a 5th of the cost. He saved me when there was a recall on the pvc air box. My air box blew before the recall and when that blows your timing belt gets oil on it, when that happens the timing belt goes bad fast. Well he recommended I change it and probably saved me 4000. I've heard people who went the the dealer and didn't get the good advice and had to pay 4000 once it broke. When it could have been prevented. "
volvo,s40,2005,kohlv, 05/03/2015,Great Car!,5,I love this car! I bought the car a year ago as my first car and its awesome. I've read everywhere that its amazingly safe and I don't doubt it. The car looks great inside out and I have never had any major mechanical issues with it. This car works great in the snow (at least the AWD model). If you keep up with regular maintenance and actually care for the vehicle you shouldn't run into any problems.
volvo,s40,2005,Dylan, 11/24/2015,Great Alternative Sports Sedan!,5,"For the past year I have been pulling my hairs out trying to determine what my next car would be. I am a car enthusiast so naturally I have a lot of favorites pulling at my heartstrings which means choosing a vehicle to replace my dependable 2005 Civic would be very difficult! I laid out the criteria I wanted: powerful engine, AWD drivetrain, compact, reliable daily driver. Sure there are some great cars that meet these like the Subaru WRX, Mitsubishi EVO, or entry-level Audis, but the truth is I wanted to own something more unique because I like to stand out. The aforementioned competitors are a lot more common are starting to feel oversaturated in the world of car culture. Not many AWD compact sedans exist, so naturally the Volvo S40 appeared to be my only option. I went for it on a whim and ended up with a beautiful 2010 R-Design with the ever-exciting T5 engine of course! So far, I am not really disappointed. The car does everything I wanted it too and even a bit more. I'm not 100% satisfied with the way it looks as it is a dated (2004, 08 refresh) design. I don't understand why Volvo dramatically updated the C30 and C70 styling but left the S40 kind of bland for its last 3 years... However, it is still a nice looking vehicle with cute yet aggressive proportions. Interior looks amazing though! A lot of people harken it to IKEA as a joke, but they aren't too far off. The interior is sleek, modern, and beautifully simple. The materials are wonderfully rich and well put together. It feels like you're in a much more expensive car with all the great driver amenities and the excellent climate control and booming stereo system. Trunk space is a little small compared to my last car (especially the opening) but it is sufficient for hauling most things. I will say the rear seats can be kind of cramped with the front seats extended backward. The car is awesome to drive. Not quite as fast as a WRX or EVO, but has potential to run with them with a few easy modifications. The T5 engine is noisy, but in the good sort of way that it gurgles in the low RPMs to remind you how sporty it wants to be. The S40 AWD handles really good and flat and so far has proven to have some great traction on slick surfaces. The brakes feel a little bit grabby and fade under hard braking, but do the job. The seats work well to keep you comfortable, even though the car's great handling comes at a cost of being very stiff and it likes to jar itself over small bumps in the road. Overall a very impressive car so far! I have not had any issues except for the oil cooler which the previous owner damaged on a curb. It was only a $120 fix locally and I am no longer dripping oil from it.

2016 Update: Since purchasing the car a little over the year ago it has had a plethora of maintenance issues and expensive repairs. when the car hit 94,000 miles, my PCV oil box failed (a common issue on these cars, but Volvo only extended the warranty on < 2008 models so my 2010 was not covered) The repair was costly and as a result of changing oil pressures, it caused my leaky cam seals to finally burst and now the car has a critical oil leak. The cam seal repair requires removal of the timing belt and water pump so prepare to do all of those replacements at once for a quoted dealer cost over $2000. I'm not sure all S40s would have this problem... but if your PCV box fails, it is likely you will experience similar issues with oil pressure drops and leaks. Also, the car randomly started having stalling issues when you shift too quickly into drive. Kind of an annoying problem that I have not found a fix for yet and left the volvo dealership puzzled... All in all, it has been an extremely costly car to own. I recommend the s40/c30/v50 only for the dedicated Volvo owners. Find one with less than 75,000 miles on it and you'll be okay. But I can't quite call the car ""unreliable"" because it
 starts up 100% of the time and despite all of these issues, it drives like nothing is wrong! The car doesn't seem to be bothered! I think a lot of people confuse ""reliability"" with ""durability"" when talking about Volvos. They are the latter.

2017 Update: For as much as I loved the driving experience of the car, it wasn't worth putting up with the constant breakdowns. I harken this car to many German luxury cars of the era and how some of its complexities only lead to a bunch of problems later in its life. High mileage and out-of-warranty, this car is a bit of a hassle. I was spilling a lot of cash to keep it running and when the AC finally died in mid summer, that was the last straw. Combined with the timing belt/cam seal repair, fixing the AC and that was going to be $4000... not worth it when the cars value had already dropped to about $8k. Though parting with the S40 was sad, I ended up trading it in for a 2014 KIA Rio SX (which has been fantastic so far!!) and I haven't really looked back. I do believe the S40 is a good car, but you are taking a gamble with reliability.

volvo,s40,2005,Ramona, 08/15/2018,Very disappointed,3,"I bought a 2005 Volvo s40 for $1850 and thought I had a great daily driver for a reasonable price. Within the first 6 months, my husband and I had to replace the starter (it was replaced right before we bought it), the alternator (which is almost $300), the calipers kept sexing even after replacing caliper 3x and the brake line, washer fluid sensor doesn’t work, terrible blind spots through front and back of car, headliner is falling down, headlights are super dim. I am honestly not that picky, but it seems like every time we turn around, the car is begging for attention. That being said, it is a very attractive car, is very comfortable with the heated leather seats, comfortable and smooth ride (when it doesn’t act up), and feels very safe. Oh yeah, not even an auxiliary hook up in this.

If you're seeking an adrenaline rush every time you hit the gas pedal, go for the T5 versus the ho-hum 2.4i. Handling is tight with almost no body lean. Highway ramps are a blast. Steering feedback is just right.  However, even with TLC, the leather has not worn well at all. The seats are thinner and harder than those in the older S40 model. There is virtually no way to add an iPod adapter, and the ride is harsh. I agree with another owner's post that the heated seats do not get warm enough.

At least once a year we have had to deal with these issues. Just recently broke down 3 times in the past month. Definitely doesn't live up to all the hype of Volvos. Wouldn't recommend this car after the past month.

volvo,s40,2005,Scott, 04/21/2010,Nice Styling and Good Value,4,"I purchased the 2.4i with the sport package in south Florida and found it loads of fun to drive.  Handles very well in the curves and the 2.4 litre engine is peppy enough for everyday traffic.  I since moved to upstate NY and it does great on the country roads, but snows are a MUST as the traction control constantly slips in winter.  I now have 90k miles on it and have had a couple of major problems, at 55k miles the radiator blew. Thank goodness for the extended warranty, or could have been $1500!  Interior design is stylish, but cheep materials.  Trim clips continually break (in trunk too) and stupid expensive to replace.  "
volvo,s40,2005,Ron, 12/22/2004,Just Buy It,4,"When I 1st saw the S40 in the LA auto show Jan 2003 I knew I was going to buy one. Picked it over my other want cars. RX8 too gas guzzler, BMW 3 series too common now, Audi A4 less power for more money, and Mini Coop selling more than invoice.  If the S Coop was around 18K I would buy that instead.  The T5 6 spd manual is perfect.  It's got power when you need it yet it can get 33 MPG going up the mountains through the grape vine at 70 mph no traffic drive in cold morning air.   High torque at low rpms making it easy to beat the young car aftermarket ad on enthusiasts.  Quiet drive as if you're not even trying to speed up.  Handling is great but car feels stiff or choppy at freeways. "

I love the premium audio system.  This car always makes ppl turn their head.  I test drove a BWM 325i, and also the Nissian 350Z, and I simply fell in love with the Volvo.  We have owned several Volvo's, however I have never liked one like I do the new S40"
volvo,s40,2005,barry, 03/01/2005,starting problem,4,i have a 2005 s40 s.41 base model with 5 speed. i have 2300 miles on it and it has been back to the shop twice so far. both times it wouldn't start and had to be towed. the 1st time they replaced the starter relay switch. now they say it's the battery. anyone else have this problem or know what the problem really is? or do i just have a lemon
volvo,s40,2005,Cincyfan, 04/14/2005,Good car for a great price,4,"I researched this car for a year before buying and believe I got a pretty good price...about 10% off MSRP.  The base engine has enough get up and go but it certainly doesn't compare to the turbo.  I bought this car for the safety features and I don't know of another <$30,000 car with this level of safety equipment - side airbags, whiplash protection and four grades of steel.  A very refined car at a reasonable price.  "
volvo,s40,2005,NewVolvoLover, 04/30/2005,I love this car!,5,"I fell in love with this car when it first came out.  I also considered the Acura TSX, Mercedes C320 and the BMW 330XI.  The Volvo won my heart after driving these other cars.  Although the stylig inside some of them may be more detailed I stuck with the Volvo.  This car is totally unique and looks really sharp on the road! The handling is awesome, the comfort level is perfect I couldn't ask for more.  I have no doubt in my mind I made the right choice.  I am getting an average of 24-25 MPG through the city so I can't complain there :) "
volvo,s40,2005,JC, 05/03/2005,Fun Car,4,"This is a fun car to drive and I love the way it looks, inside and out.  The mileage is bad and that's a big suprise given what Volvo says it ""should"" be getting.  I get around 300 miles to a tank of premium gas.  These days, with fuel prices what they are, that hurts....alot.  I know other people with the same car that have no problems at all.  Maybe it's a quality control problem."
volvo,s40,2005,Rodriguez, 05/03/2005,Great Car!,4,"Bought this car a month ago. We are surpised at how many features it has. We are still discovering some of the thoughtfulness in the design. The car has a lot of power and seems to perform better the faster you go. The interior design feels roomy, and the console seems to wrap around you. This car definitely turns heads. Very sexy! "
volvo,s40,2005,richard, 05/13/2005,New S40 2.4i,4,"The vehicle handles at top speed and curves.  However, the initial pick-up is a bit slow.  The interiors are gorgeous, as well as the exterior.  Good workmanship, both in and out."
volvo,s40,2005,Eric, 05/18/2005,S40,4,This is my first car that i purchased. Prior to this i was driving a GEO Prizm.  This is a large upgrade.  I own the 2.4i and even with the limited HP the car still has a deep growl when compared to other cars that i drove of a compareable price.  I have never been happier driving my car.
volvo,s40,2005,Bob H, 05/30/2005,Suprise S40,4,I am very pleased with the price - value ratio of the Volvo S40.  The performance of the T5 is nothing short of incredible.  The mileage is also a pleasant surprise.  I am averaging 27.5 combined city/highway mileage on mid- level gas.  This is particularily nice since I last owned a Expedition.  The new style with a set of crome wheels really sets off the fire-engine red body.  I would highly recommend this vehicle. 
volvo,s40,2005,jessenola, 06/09/2005,S40T5 - great when it's not in the shop,3,"I bought the S40T5 after my TSX was totaled.  It's been in the shop 4 times: failed oxygen sensor, failed engine computer (requiring flatbed towing and a week-long wait for the part), check engine lights, failed fuel pump sensor, and a loose part in drivers door.  Still the stereo stops working at random requiring a restart, the auto transmission shifts are so jerky in manumatic mode that I have to leave it in D, and there are rattles that the dealer refuses to acknowledge.  At every service stop the local dealer service is pathetic.  It is seriously fun to drive when it works, but the service is ridiculous."
volvo,s40,2005,GJacobs, 06/24/2005,Great Car,4,Very solidly built car.  Manual shift makes car fun to drive.  Great pickup (5 cylinder) easy to drive/steer.  Drastic change/improvement in car design over previous years.  Very good value for the money and compared to its competitors.

This is our first Volvo and we have been nothing short of impressed with our purchase.  Well designed, easy to drive for both city and highway, solid road feel and handling, decent performance with the base 5 cyl. engine, the manual transmission is one of the best I have tried.  Nothing can beat the solid feel of this car in this price range.   "
volvo,s40,2005,Jason, 06/29/2005,"I love the car, with one exception",4,"I love this car, with one exception. The front seats are not overly comfortable.  Unless one sits on the seat the correct way, he'll hurt his hips or his back.  Aside from the seating issue, the car is a winner.  I drove to the office in an incredible downpour.  The car performed perfectly.  I felt like I was in command of the road.  I'd recommend this car to anyone, just make sure the seats are comfortable to you."
volvo,s40,2005,Dos santos, 09/21/2005,Dissapointed,3,"With gas prices as they are, this purchase was as much about fuel economy as was safety and styling.  The EPA ratings say 22 city/ 30 highway.  City driving we get 16 and highway 21.  This is so far off the mark, I feel ripped off.  The dealership just says there are variations. Other than using the AC, I drive as fuel efficiently as possible.  I have no problems with our other cars.  I bought this to help save money opn gas but I guess I'll have to drive my 7 passenger Toyota SUV , 8 cylinder,that gets gas mileage just shy of these numbers.   Why is it some auto makers test their vehicles more accurately than others???    "

volvo,s40,2005,Frankie76, 10/25/2005,Better than my A4,5,"If you going to buy an S40, go with the turbo. This model has a much better performance than the 2.41 engine. I had an 03 A4 1.8. which I traded for the S40. I have not looked back!! From quality to performance and of course safety, it beats my Audi in all categories. I first drove this car as a company car, leased 2004.5 2.4i. I recently turned it back as I had put 40,000 miles. That car had absolutely no problems. Other than the scheduled maint."
volvo,s40,2005,rsb, 10/28/2005,Mixed Impressions,4,"Overall I am very satisfied with the performance and build. Not too satisfied with the A/C performance -- even after software update, A/C does not always switch on correctly. Clutch pedal making noise even after greasing. Trunk had problems with the lock. "
volvo,s40,2005,Dave from Chicago, 12/29/2005,I highly recommend this car,5,"I can't say enough good things about the Volvo S40 T5.   The vehicle is sporty and refined, delivering nimble handling and peppy acceleration in a sleek and comfortable package.  The interior design is as intuitive as it is impressive,  with great looks, excellent control placement, and firm yet comfortable seats. The trunk size is also fantastic for its class.   For its performance, the fuel economy is exceptional.  I regularly get better than 35 mpg on true highway speeds, and I typically average around 25 mpg in the city.  City dwellers will particularly enjoy the size of the vehicle, which makes finding parking spaces easy while  providing ample interior space."
volvo,s40,2005,JohnnyVolvo, 05/23/2006,"A Great Car, mostly",4,"I like this car.  I like the interior, the exterior, the fit and finish, etc. etc. etc.  If I had it to do all over again, I would still look very closely at this car.  The fuel economy is bad though.  No way around it, my car gets lousy gas milage.  Advertised mileage is 22 City and 31 Hwy.  I get 21 and some change on the highway.  I really don't drive in the city enough to make any claim to what I would get there, but 21 on the highway?  Nope....not acceptable mileage."

couple weeks around the SF Bay area recently and 
came away very impressed.
For comparison I test drove the g35 sedan, Audi 
A4, Subaru WRX and Passat V6; still the s40 came 
away w/ higher marks in imho.
I had the opportunity to push it up to 125 and do 
some high speed mountain driving to test it's road 
holding and passing prowess. Succeeded admirably 
w/out complaints nor any noticeable under/
oversteer or turbolag.
This car loves to go.
Ride was a good compromise between road-
holding and comfort, though if it was me I would 
have stiffened the suspension slightly."

more each day. I travel a lot of back 
country roads and this beauty performs! 
Only complaint so far, highway driving 
seems a bit harsh.  Oddly enough I 
would think it would be smooth on the 
highway, it seems to ride better on 
hilly country roads. The S40 responds 
to your every need, its comfortable, 
responsive and turns heads. I test 
drove a 2005 Subaru Outback turbo, the 
250hp did not come close to the 
performance of the 218hp Volvo.  I 
originally wanted the AWD drive version 
but for some reason is hard to get. I 
opted for the automatic geartronic

drive. "

the new S40 models I went to the

more money for cars like the Audi A4, 
or the BMW 325i and not get anywhere 
near what this car offers.  Trust me

volvo,s40,2005,Horsefeeder, 11/08/2004,2005 S40,4,"This is definitely a great/cheaper 
alternative to the A4, if performance 
is not your thing. The base 2.4 has 
little zip, but handles very well - 
except on the highway.  The gas tank, 
though listed at 16 gallons, is 
actually only 12 due to a poor design 
which placed a 'hump' in the gas tank 
to allow for the AWD option.  Instead 
of a 350+/- range, its more like 260, 
which means more trips to the gas 
station (thank Ford for that!).  Great 
trunk space, lots of leg-room in the 
back seat, fold-down back seat provides 
tons of cargo space for such a small 
car.  If you're used to a 4-cylinder, 
get the base 2.4, but if you're used to 
a 6-cylinder, get the T5 or else you'll 
be bored out of your mind!"

level sports sedan. For under $25,000 
the s40 gives you a great unique design 
and comfort. The 2.5L engine is under 
powered for this car, and the lack of 
power doesn't give you a good fuel 
economy in this case. I am getting 
about 18-20 mpg for city and highway.

researching cars now for the last 6 
months and have test driven numerous 
competitors such as the new Subaru 
Legacy, Mazda 3S, Audi A4, and Acura

of them...not quite as fast as the Audi 
or Acura, but a smoother more 
comfortable drive.  It blows the Subaru 
and Mazda out of the water although the 
Subie was much nicer than the Mazda.  
Great dealership experience.  This is

I test drove it, I was sold.  I'm not a 
car freak and drive to/from work (about 
45 miles a day) and run some errands on

Having three cars already, I 
planned to buy a new one at the end of 2004 and
I did. 

I was also considering the Audi A4, Mazda RX8, 
Mini Cooper, BMW 3-Series and the Volvo S40 T5.
The  A4 did not have enough mid-range torque.
The RX8 guzzled too much gasoline.  My neighbor 
already has two BMWs andthe Mini 
was going for more than list price!  
So I got the Volvo.

This car's Acceleration is impressive as you 
quietly leave the loud pocket rockets 
the kids drive in the dust.  Its pick-up is calm and 
smooth, if you lose on a standing 
start to a souped up car, you'll 
appear as if you weren't trying to 
race anyway.

Volvo has definitely done a great job

originally interested in the BMW 325i. 
I figured I would at least give the 
competitors a try, so I test drove the 
Audi A4, Mercedes C230, and Acura TSX. 
I came across the S40 while doing some 
research on Edmunds. The ratings were 
good and the price looked even better. 
I went for a test drive and I was

fit and finish of the Acura was 
tempting, it was the handling of the

volvo,s40,2005,BPH, 01/22/2005,Tellin' All: A Female Perspective,5,"I test drove, researched and admired the T5 months before the big purchase.  A4 came close in handling and comfort and the Saab 9-3 in speed and safety. What kept drawing me back?  The car has an amazing stereo system with and without the upgrade, is fabulous in all weather conditions, received 5 stars in side-impact crash testing and did I mention how fast it is?  I went with the 6 speed, which took a bit getting used to BUT it was worth it! I definitely recommend the sport package, for it gives the S40 a unique and sleek appearance.  You might ask yourself .. is everyone really staring at me?  The answer is YES!  This car is definitely a great bang for the buck."
volvo,s40,2005,mountain driver, 01/21/2005,Sensible Sports car,4,"I love my car!   It handles the mountain canyon roads with assurance and enough power to make it fun.  As soon to be empty nesters, I was looking to downsize from my Suburban but still have a safe car and it had to be fun.  We had Volvos a long time ago but they were nothing like this car. We also drove BMW Z- not for year round.  Audi TT Coupe- no sunroof!  Honda Accord 6cyl MT6 speed Coupe- also great car, fun but everyone has a Honda. We plan to do some autocross this spring."
volvo,s40,2005,Jesus Levy, 01/24/2005,Unexpected Surprises,4,"Great compact sports sedan, totally packed with luxurious features that makes this car a pleasant and unexpected surprise for the new driver.  Nimble and precise handling, great maneuverability, awesome power and throttle response and fun to drive.  Volvo has got it right this time.  Not only the car excells on all safety and security features, but the box design is gone forever!!  Now that's what I call thinking out of the box.  The new design and platform are superb.  Brakes stop on a dime.  Cornering is quite sporty and inspires a safe feeling all the time.  Traction control is unobtrusive, so you can also have a fun ride whatever the highway demands.  Just avoid harsh terrains."
volvo,s40,2005,Jim Loukides, 02/04/2005,Volvo S40 T5 Revoew,3,"Since purchasing this car, 2 months ago, it has been back to the dealership 6 for repairs on the radio.  I purchased the upgraded stereo, which obviously was a mistake as it never works.  When trying to change a station on the radio, after the car has been restarted, the sounds dies and the radio ""locks-up"".  The only way to ""un- lock"" the radio is by shutting the car off and restarting.  Volvo Corp. has been very unresponsive in my concerns about this issue.   I will think twice before EVER purchasing another Volvo. "
volvo,s40,2005,Brian, 02/07/2005,WAY more bang for the buck...,4,"I use this primarily as an ""airport"" car so I wasn't looking to make an emotional purchase. I wanted a dependable, well-made, safe sedan that offered a warranty at least as long as my 48-month lease.  I got a lot more than I bargained for with the S40  It's very rewarding to drive-- solid, smooth, and responsive enough with the 5 speed manual to have plenty of freeway acceleration. This car feels like it could be driven over 100MPH all day long without breaking a sweat.  Fantastic interior with a very smart center control console.  So much more car for the money than the Camry, Mazda 6, and Honda Civic I shopped it against.  Would recommend to anyone. Great car, period!  "
volvo,s40,2005,Airborne, 02/09/2005,Better than before...,4,"I'm a high school senior, and I bought a 2003 Volvo S40 in May of 2003. I fell in love with it, it was fast and agile. But over time it started to rattle alot, and despite the dealers efforts, it always came back. So that led me to look for a new car. I stoped by the dealer to see what they'd give me for my old S40 when I saw the new one. I test drove a 2.4i with the Premium and Sport package and settled on a Silver 2.4i w/ Black leather interior and the Premium package. Best buy I ever made. It's a night and day difference between the old one. This is quiet, fast, the sound system is unbeleiveable and even safer than before. I got a discount for being a returing customer and it was worth it."
volvo,s40,2005,Steves36, 02/22/2005,Awesome car to drive and looks great,5,"We bought this the last month and just love it.  We opted for all options and used Edmunds for the quote...  Wow what a nice feeling buying a car without hassle.  The car drives like a champ with the sport package, makes great turns and has good pickup.  Back seats are OK, but could be a little bigger but my wife still car pools with 3 people.  The warranty can't be beat and to include all routine stuff is great compaired to what we got with my car (Ford).  If I had to do it all over again I would without thinking.  It's an awesome car at an awesome price"
volvo,s40,2005,uhlr, 02/21/2005,Mountain and City,5,"Brand new, only 500 miles so far: every mile sweet, smooth, fun driving.  AWD and good power without killing gas mileage.  I got over 29 mpg in high country mountainous (7,000 to 11,500 ft), snowy, +sunny driving. This is a replacement for an unreliable S60 AWD. Volvo made good. Confident driving feel even at high speed or on snow/ice."
volvo,s40,2005,CBell, 03/03/2005,Great car for value!,4,"This Volvo definitely has an appealing design both on the outside and the inside.  The engine is fun to drive and the car handles well in a sport driving mode due to its compact size. The fuel consumption is a bit more than what I expected for a small engine and the finishing could be better (noise isolation). Overall, this car gives great driving pleasure and has a certain class for a price which remains very affordable compared to other Euro imports in the same category."
volvo,s40,2005,Excellent Car, 03/04/2005,The World of Volvo,5,"Wow! This car is awesome.  Stylish, solid, safe & sound - welcome to the world of Volvo  What more can ask of an entry-level luxury sport sedan. I feel really smart driving this car and even smarter when I spend less than $25K for it (w/automatic and gnarly standard features, and season ski pass & lift for 2 to Vail & Heavenly).  It priced much less than the Audi A4 or BMW 325 and WOW it's a better car in everyway. "
volvo,s40,2005,chaz, 03/10/2005,Excellent Value,4,"This is our first Volvo and so far I,m very impressed,  The styling, both interior and exterior is very eye catching.  The safety features are second to none and while the performance of the 2.4I is nothing special it does offer adequate power and above average ride and handling.  I highly recommend the heated leather seats as well as the sport package which includes 17"" alloy wheels.  The base single CD player is more than adequate. On the downside the interior is a little cramped for me,(602,200lbs)and the back seat would be very tight for adults.  Also, our standard sized booster seats did not fit in the back seats.  Volvo does offer as an accessorie a booster cushion/ backrest."
volvo,s40,2005,Anjali, 03/14/2005,Classic and Sporty Car,4,"S40 is simply fantastic. Very classy and yet very sporty. The newly re- designed 2005 model looks much better than the 2004. The 2.4i has 168 HP, which is enough to leave behind many cars at intersections. Brakes are excellent. The ride is very comfortable and smooth. The seats have lumbar support which is great. Overall, a very sturdy car which looks great on the outside and beautiful on the inside. Steering is not as easy as the Infinity or some of the more expensive cars but the manual says it gives you controlled back which is the perfect term to use. You'll get used to the steering and like it. The 2005 model feels a little better than the 2004 model. A great buy...worth very penny!"
volvo,s40,2005,Irvine, 03/14/2005,Best car I've owned!!!,4,"After over 3 years of test driving new cars (yes, I realize that's a bit much) I finally decided on the new S40.   I drove the Acura TL (it gave me whiplash between every gear in the AUTOMATIC!), Infiniti G35 (performed well, but looks like plastic on the inside), Nissan Mazima (cornered like the car was on stilts), Honda Accord (GREAT car, but not as classy as I wanted), and many many more.  Out of all these, the Volvo had the best performance, and best interior/exterior design, without giving into the BMW's poor reputation for reliability.  I'm focused on reliability and quality while still getting soemthing I ENJOY driving.  I've had the Volvo S40 for 6 months and no signs of problems."
volvo,s40,2005,Ted Feldman, 03/18/2005,Great Car,5,"So happy I purchased the S40. It is fun to drive, great style and performance. I am actually getting the gas mileage that was posted on the window - 21-30. "
volvo,s40,2005,Dave, 03/23/2005,Wow!,5,"What a great car!  I chose this car over the Subaru Legacy as I wanted an AWD vehicle.  This car has plenty of power and feels very sporty.  I love the exterior styling and the Volvo emphasis on safety.  You will not be disappointed with this car at all.  I chose the Leather, convenience package, Climate Package, Bi-Xenon headlights and 17"" wheels.  The seats are very comfortable even after having spent 3 hours in the car today.  The only negative is the rear visibility.  It is a bit smaller than what I am used to.  With Volvo offering $1,850 cash back on the T5 model, it was an easy choice.  "
volvo,s40,2005,Outstanding, 03/23/2005,"First, & not my last, Volvo",5,"Outstanding.  The real benefit that isn't advertised with the Volvo Safety is with the new DTSC system, you don't HAVE accidents.  I drove this car on a  Test Track in Germany for 8 hours under all conditions and couldn't spin it out in any circumstance.  It is incredible.  This is my first AWD vehicle and it's handling in snow and ice is better than on dry pavement with my old rear wheel drive cars.  "
volvo,s40,2005,Rob, 04/01/2005,Great car,4,"After eight months I still look forward to getting in the car.  Not as much power as the T5 but more than enough for normal driving.  Handling is superb.  After driving Hondas, I appreciate the low end torque and the smooth shifting.  Controls are logically designed.  The interior is spartan but comfortable and without gimmicks.  Fit and finish is excellent.  I enjoy getting compliments on the car as there still are not that many around.  I think it is one of the best looking current models."
volvo,s40,2005,regin lamson, 04/22/2005,good rating,5,"I have a 2004 honda cr-v,and a 2004 honda accord,and just three days ago i traded my accord,for an s-40 and i am really  glad i traded my other car because of the comfort and really fun to drive very good in curves and turns.You wouldnt be sorry if you decide to buy this super car!!!!"
volvo,s40,2005,Bonnie, 05/20/2005,Volvo for Life,5,"I've had several cars in my life.  When it came time to look for something new, we went to the typical dealers.  Just by chance, we stopped in at a Volvo dealer never thinking we could afford one.  Well, we were wrong .. but most importantly, I wound up in my Volvo S40.  This car kicks.  I call it my zippy car.  It's so comfortable and fun to drive, I'm now Volvo for Life.  My husband had just bought a Pontiac Bonneville a month earlier and wishes he could get into the Volvo S80, but he would be up-side down, so we'll have to wait until his car is paid off in 2010 ... bummer.  In the mean time, I'm enjoying my Volvo and recommend it to anyone. My Dad always said they are the safest car out."
volvo,s40,2005,S40 - So Cal, 05/22/2005,Nothing Else For Me,4,"This S40 is sweet, strong, rugged, sleek and stylish, need I say more?  Stops when you need it to stop, accelerates when you need a push, and shows itself off at every corner; this puppy has bragging rights!  Never a bad moment here and nothing bad to say at all. Proves itself all the time, to trust it with my wife and future kids; always!  My first Volvo and my last time to ever have to choose another car maker!  First class!"
volvo,s40,2005,Hieu, 05/23/2005,Sporty Car,5,"I bought this car because I wanted something different but sporty. Other cars I looked at was the Acura TSX and the Acura TL. In terms of power, this car seems to fit nicely between those two. It has a low pressure turbo at about 8.7 psi max. Power comes on quick when you need it. You don't not have to rev it to get usable power. Has potential for really good power with a ECU mod.  I didn't notice this eariler but there are seals all round the doors, even in the area around where the hinge opens."
volvo,s40,2005,Robs S40, 06/05/2005,S40 Rocks!,5,"I have had the car now for only 2 weeks, but so far its wonderful, I had it built and delivered to the dealership (I wanted navigation). The nav system is easy to use, the surround sound system will make some of your old CD's come to life and the car just has an amazing list of standard features and is one hell of a piece of eye candy in black. I had a Jetta before and this is an excellent upgrade from one of those. If you don't like the latest jetta or you want a little luxury w/o the big outlay of money take a look at this one."
volvo,s40,2005,CJF, 06/04/2005,Still Smiling,4,"Purchased the S40 T5 at the beginning of August, 2004.  Ten months and 13000 miles later, I still smile every time I see my S40 in the parking lot or garage.  I had also considered the Acura TSX, Infiniti G35 and Honda Accord V6 coupe - and have no regrets over my decision. The low end torque provided by the turbo means fun starts any time I want them. The sport suspension provides crisp cornering and keeps the car headed where I want it to go.  While a compact car, the back seat is still large enough to haul three teen agers around town comfortably.  "
volvo,s40,2005,Lisa, 06/19/2005,great entry Volvo,4,"My husband and I test drove a nissan altima as well as the volvo s40 we purchased.  It was an easy decision, only thing the altmia had over the volvo was more leg room for rear seating.  Volvo S40 is a solid car and a fun car to drive. It was like going from the Motel 6 to the Omni."
volvo,s40,2005,DSM, 07/01/2005,Nothing but trouble,2,"I purchased my '05 S40 brand new back in November.  As soon as I hit 3,000 miles everything went downhill.  I found myself taking my car in for repairs more than I was driving it!  In the 6 months that I owned it, it spent 45 days in the service department during 7 separate visits!  And they couldn't even fix most of the problems!  This was the worst decision I have ever made.  Thanks to an attorney, I filed a lawsuit against Volvo and they were forced to purchase the car back.  Never again will I buy another Volvo."
volvo,s40,2005,Michael S., 07/05/2005,Love it!,4,"OK, so I don't drive much. I work from home, so I do mostly short trips with an occasional 30 mile highway drive. That said, I love my S40. Great pickup on the highway when I need it (80 without even trying), OK gas mileage around town. I have the premium sound and moonroof. Loved the moonroof before we hit rainy season here in Miami, and the sound system is like being in a concert hall. Not many S40s on the road here, so it's nice having a somehwat unique car. Extremely pleased so far (even though I haven't even broken 1,000 miles yet)."
volvo,s40,2005,S40 T5, 07/15/2005,S40 T5,4,"Awesome car! The turbocharged engine is very powerful and will easily break the front tires loose. I have the sport package w/ dynamic sport suspension and it makes for a great handling car with little body lean. Geartronic automatic transmission is very smooth and fun manual control, it will actually allow you to take off in first, second, or third gear! This car feels very solid and the steering has nice weight and feel. Excellent build quality, everything feels solid and of high quality and nothing creaks, squeaks or rattles. This is a great, fun to drive car."
volvo,s40,2005,ken, 08/23/2005,Solid and nice looking,4,"After 4 months and 4000 miles the S40 T5(prem,clim,conv,audio,auto)is doing okay. Chose FWD to improve MPG and reliabilty. Only service is for fuel pump gasket that causes the check engine light and they always try to blame on improper gas cap application. Pending service for weak Homelink transmitter and broken lens on light below ext mirror. The computer for radio and all the program functions needs to be rebooted occasionally. The OS must be MS product! It is just the right size for my wife(short),very responsive, unique, easy to park. It is costly and MPG is disappointing."
volvo,s40,2005,mbjeanes, 10/07/2005,love it but mine's a lemon,3,"After researching and test driving cars for 4 months, I fell in love with the S40. It drives like a dream, accelerates well,is fun to shift, has a moon roof and premium sound system. Couldn't be happier-- when it's not in the shop. I've owned the car less than 9 weeks and it's been in the shop for 24 days. It has less than 18K mi. The climate control sensor blew hot air and was serviced 2x before replacement was backordered; the window regulators on both front windows were replaced; window rail on driver's side replaced; the passenger seat belt was replaced (air bag light came on). I'm scheduled to pick it up tomorrow but after 3 wks in a loaner, I'm not sure I'll remember how to drive it"
volvo,s40,2005,Andrea, 10/06/2005,Very Disappointed,3,I have had this car for less than a year and it has been in the shop for brake problems 3 times already. I've also had to go in for software updates for 3 times also. Now I'm having a airbag issue. The company is non- responsive to these problems. This car has made me miss my old car that was 8 years old.
volvo,s40,2005,Britian, 11/10/2005,Fun to drive!,5,I'm loving my volvo!  I've had it for almost a year and 3 STRANGERS have asked me if they can hop in the front seat while I was pumping gas!  What a car.  It definitely turns heads and did I mention it was FUN TO DRIVE?!
volvo,s40,2005,Dooney, 11/09/2005,An understated driving experience!,4,"I traded my 2001 Saab Viggen (awesome car, but costly repairs) on the T5 Automatic.  While I don't feel the THRUST of the turbo Viggen, my Volvo S40 is more luxery and still packs a lot of power.  I hear the 6speed manual is much faster - oh well.  My experience so far is, this is a great car.  I commute 30 miles daily, and the premium sound system (12-speakers) makes my ride very enjoyable.  My wife and I bought this car because of Volvo's safety track record, and we want to start a family soon.  This car is sporty enough for people in their late 20s, and sophisticated in a grown up kind of way at the same time.  Other cars we considered were the 2006 VW Jetta (too big), Audi A4 (too much)."
volvo,s40,2005,David Beardsley, 11/22/2005,Great Car,4,"When I began test driving cars, I really hadn't given Volvo any thought. In Portland, Volvo means the big boxy station wagons you see all over SE. The S40 came up on some comparable vehicles lists and on a whim I test drove the T5. After that everything else I drove seemed like a cheap garbage. The car is very smooth and quite, has a great interior, and I love the body style. You won't be racing Mustangs off the line but on the highway passing is great fun. I'm 6', 200lbs, which I don't consider that big, but the S40 was one of few cars I felt like I fit into. Only wish I could've afforded the AWD. :)"
volvo,s40,2005,mattkorey, 12/20/2005,"The Perfect Car for Me, Recommend It !!",4,"This was exactly what I wanted and after having it for 10 months I just love it.  And the European delivery program is unbeatable.  A free trip to Europe basically and a discount on the car.  You keep looking for the catch and there isn't one.  I'm now a member of the cult of Volvo it appears.  The car has a lot of get up and go and the body style is great looking.  Love the black/black leather that I selected, looks so sharp.  The interior is really cool as well, the console is very unique, as is the car overall.  It's nice not seeing your car everywhere you look.  Couldn't recommend it highly enough."
volvo,s40,2005,Brian, 01/28/2006,My Volvo!,4,"I bought my Volvo used with 3k miles on it and have driven it all over Europe, I have yet to have any problems. The only thing I could possibly complain about is the lack of factory tint on my windows. Also if you have something heavy (15 lbs) or more sitting in the passenger seat it will sound a bell and there is a flashing seatbelt sign. If you can call that a bad thing. And the last one is the lack of after market sterios made to utilize the new dash/radio in the S40."
volvo,s40,2005,Nick, 02/10/2006,Volvo comes up with the times.,5,"I was in the market for a good reliable family car, and I found it!  This is a very fun car to drive (with manual tranny), room enough for 4 adults, or 2 adults and 2 kids, excellent gas mileage, and the Volvo reliablility."
volvo,s40,2005,jay, 02/14/2006,Good Car,4,Car runs great in Snow.  The winter mode and traction control kept the car rather stable while driving in the first blizzard of 2006. The car has plenty get up and go for a small sedan. 
volvo,s40,2005,problem s40!!!, 02/21/2006,So many problems!,3,"I checked out a variety of cars in this category, and eventually settled on the s40. i loved the design, and heard such promising things about volvos, that i thought i was making the right decision. however, i have had problems with this car since day one. it has been back to the dealership 6 times in the year and a half that i've owned it. the first problem occurred when the car was less than 2 weeks old. the steering column had to be replaced. since then it has been back 5 times for starter control unit problems! volvo has not been particularly helpful either. i wish that i kept my 98 honda civic, which had absolutely no problems!"
volvo,s40,2005,Jason, 04/30/2006,S40 2.4i,4,"Awesome little car, fun for 2 people, 4 is definitely a crowd though, unless your friends are small. the performance of the 2.4i just isnt there, but the T5 which I test drove is a blast, the 2.4i is great fun, but if you're a serious driver, get the T5 S40 or an S60R"
volvo,s40,2005,smithran, 06/26/2006,Very satisfied buyer!,4,"I purchased my S40 T5 in August 2004. It is actually a 2004.5(2005).  To date, I have 32K miles on the car and still handles and performs like I just drove it off the lot.  The only problem I have had with the car was a defective security chip (15K miles).  Once replaced, not another problem.  This car feels safe and secure.  The car also loves the highway. Cruising an interstate at 80-85mph seems to be the speed this car loves.  I just hope I can keep evading speeding tickets.  Acceleration you ask?  Well..A co-worker has an BMW M3 and he has trouble trying to get away from me ..{{Smiling}}  Would I buy another S40 T5?  YES! Without a second thought and the price is right. {{Wink}}"
volvo,s40,2005,harvey, 07/18/2006,"great care, great price",4,"i was shocked to read about all of the problems some people have had with their s40.  the only problems i've had with mine are the ones i caused - i got a little too close to at trash can on the side of the road and cracked my mirror (but only the glass, the motor was fine), ran over a nail and got a flat, cracked my oil pan backing down a driveway even though i was extremely careful (i guess the car is a little low for a sedan).  other than that, NO problems.   i love harvey (my car)!  super fun to drive and plenty of power.  on a road trip to vegas i was approaching nascar speeds - and i don't have the more powerful turbo engine.  "
volvo,s40,2005,shelly, 09/25/2006,i think i got a dud,4,"First of all, never ever buy a car from Pioneer Saab Volvo in Deerfield, MA. I'm finally straightening the mess my dealer made- 2 years later. I love my S40. It's my first volvo-styling, size, mileage, ride...all works for me. In the last year I've had many problems. One year after having the car the heat stopped working, it took volvo a month to get me the part and appt so I drove around freezing for a month, they had to replace a major motor part. Twice since July, my AC has stopped working and my radio also glitches all the time. I'm debating selling because the warranty is going to run out soon, but I just love it otherwise--I'm torn. Do the '06 or '07's have these problems?"
volvo,s40,2005,judy, 11/07/2006,My First Volvo,4,"This is my first Volvo and I came to it from a Mazda Miata.  I do miss the performance of the Miata, my Volvo seems a tad sluggish at times, but overall a good car.  My (older) parents are able to get in and out of the car easily and the three of us can be comfortable enough.  I don't have any regrets, but the Miata was more fun."
volvo,s40,2005,fred ehmann, 11/21/2006,S-40 2.4i,4,"This is a solid car that will please those looking more for quiet, comfort, and reliability rather than punchy performance. The motor is willing--just not exciting. However, 30 mpg is the payoff for what you give up in thrills.  In 2+ years and 35,000 miles I've not had a single repair and am on original tires and brakes. Not bad!"
volvo,s40,2005,smb83, 01/18/2007,still love this car . . .,5,"I have had this car almost two years and am still very happy. 28-30 mpg consistently. No problems, just in for software upgrade on radio one time. Easy and fun to drive; great on highway and around town; great in snow and rain. Very happy, will definitely buy another S40 when ready to trade. Love my S40. "
volvo,s40,2005,jake, 04/26/2007,2005 Volvo S40 T5 (6 speed man),5,This car is a fantastic driver with its perfect amount of power for its 6 speed manual transmission. I drive surface streets and freeway everyday to work and this car hands great through traffic in low speeds and really shines at high speeds. The turbo and 6 speed manual combo makes merging onto high speed freeways not just easy but a delight. I get complimented daily at it's appearance. Plenty of room for the entire family of 4. Trunk space is generous. I especially like how well the hood is tucked into the body design.  I would suggest for your seating comfort to choose leather over T tech fabric. Just a note the sport suspension may be a little stiff for some peoples comfort but you reap the great benefits of it's smooth handling and cornering ability.
volvo,s40,2005,Ric, 07/20/2007,4th Time a Charm,4,"I have now purchased my fourth Volvo.  I own a 240 GL (each of my kids learned to drive in it) a V70 XC AWD (wife's) and an 850 GLT.  Combined, I have over 550K miles on them all - and this isn't counting my first one, a 240 DL wagon which I put over 300K on as the kid mover car!!  Now I own an S40 T5 AWD and it is the best Volvo I have ever had!  If I am careful, I even get good gas mileage (around 29 mpg combined).  It is fun to drive and a solid handling and feeling car.  I anticipate putting lots of miles on this car like I have my other ones!"
volvo,s40,2005,chanachi, 05/23/2007,"Nice Car, but Unreliable",4,"Purchased this vehicle in May of 2004 - the new body style.  Nice styling, interior, and ride.  In my opinion, reliability has been poor.  The car has less than 23K miles and has had problems with brakes (bad rotors) and engine (all intake valves replaced).  Thankfully the vehicle was covered under the warranty.  I would not recommend this car."
volvo,s40,2005,Sam, 09/26/2007,"Great car, great price",5,"So far I love this car. It runs great and all the chicks dig it!  I love all the automatic features and love the styling.  It's my first European car and I must say, it blows my Honda Accord out of the water!  The power is nice, but the turbo is a little tricky... but I managed to hit some nice speeds on the highway.  Overall, I hope this car maintains its value in the long run!"

volvo,s40,2006,terri campbell, 07/26/2016,Great car for the miles,5,"Good safe car. Solid engine with great acceleration. No worries with the car running. The interior is a bit like wearing a helmet. Sounds weird but I always feel like I put on a helmet the ceiling is so low. I bought this car for the safety rating and it feels like a solid car. Handles all road conditions with ease. Comfortable interior that is so great I made it from NY to Chicago in one leg more than a dozen times. The only down side is when you do have maintenance the shops want to gorge you. So finding a kind appreciative mechanic is a must. Think of it from the other side, the mechanics of the Volvo are so good that any mechanic knows they will  not see you again for another 20,000+ miles (except oil changes).
Update:  I retired to Florida. THIS IS NOT A HOT WEATHER CAR. My Volvo always started in the cold. Subzero Chicago mornings were no problem. I did not have an engine block heater or a garage. 
Update:  Minor items are in need of repair or replacement, Right on schedule.  Engine still runs fantastic so I see no need to trade this puppy in for a new one.
Update 145k took a long distance trip 2,000 miles and everything was solid. I had hoses replaced prior month. I had a road handling challenge with a big rig. Got run off to a shoulder. This car handling was solid, got back on with smooth as soon as big rig passed. An SUV would have overturned, not thic S40.
Sadly i traded the volvo in. The florida sun dissolved the interior ceiling liner and it cost too much to replace.

We were recently hit at full speed from a guy who ran a red light! our car absorbed all the impact. None of us were severely injured (thank God!). I miss my 'Velvet' already :-(.  We always got tons of remarks on the styling and the interior. Very sturdy, high quality equipment inside and out. Looked great with 18"" rims on it. I bought it fresh from the Swedish factory in 2005, and had ZERO mechanical problems in 5 yrs of driving, including driving 2 yrs on the autobahn! My car was totaled in the accident but I plan to get another. I am Volvo for life. :-)"
volvo,s40,2006,gradstudent456, 06/02/2015,Great Investment,4,"My S40 has nearly 150K miles on it and with regular maintenance, tire rotations/balancing and oil changes, I have had very few issues. I constantly receive compliments on how elegant the car is. Many acquaintances believe it newer and more expensive than it is. I am lucky to have Volvo-specialized mechanic with integrity in town. While parts are expensive, I plan on having the car until it dies because it is such good quality. Purchasing this vehicle is like purchasing a high-quality leather handbag. It is expensive but if you care for it regularly, the investment will bring you satisfaction and contentment for many years. You will be proud to own even if it is not the newest."

This car has a broken steering wheel it just kind of falls in your lap but thats fine considering how hard I drive it. This car has had no problems with anything. My only concern is when will Volvo start to profit off there car commercials. Make Volvo top of reliability.  my last car was a 940 and it just ran forever. I think it died after 516K yeah 516K how many Toyota are like that? buy this car and you'll love every thing about it. like the safety, reliability, and ride. Volvo has a lot to be remembered for.

At one point the driver door wouldn't open and I had to enter my car through the passenger side. Volvo ended up settling for a good sized pay out. Here is a list of other problems I had with car, none of which were covered by warranty as they occurred just after the 50k warranty was up:
1) engine thermostat never worked
2) due to above, car overheated, replaced radiator reservoir & new thermostat

Even with the normally aspired 5 cylinder it has great pickup.  The road handing is head and shoulders above Camry, Sable, and Impalas that I have had for company cars.  There is a nice road feel with responsive steering yet a not unacceptable ride or noise.  After correcting an A/c blower motor that was faulty on delivery, it has been problem free.  Now with 4 years and 64K miles, It has been to the shop for A/C compressor replacement and twice for electrical diagnostics which found not problems despite the high $ diagnostics.  "

However, one day there was a dog on the freeway in the fast lane. I swerved and couldn't gain control back. I went across five lanes of traffic where I then flipped, all while doing 70. The curtain airbag deployed and I was able to walk away with a small bruise. Needless to say, I went and bought another 06 blue Volvo s40 T5. And I could not be happier. Once a Volvo, always a Volvo. I have not had any issues with the new one. Usual maintenance and what not, gas mileage is at about 24-27 MPG, but not bad for a turbo."

volvo,s40,2006,Isabella Amato, 12/07/2018,I hate this car.,3,"I have a 2006 s40 2.4i volvo. It's got a nice look, but I hate it so much. We bought it used with about 125,000 miles on it. It was a reliable dealer who had very good reviews. The first couple weeks with the car was great, It handles good, is comfortable and has a nice interior. But, after three weeks I've had problem after problem. First the fuel pump broke, while I was on the highway. I was straitened on the highway for a good hour. That was about $1,000 to fix and I didn't have my car for about a week. Then some type of fuel gauge broke a couple of weeks later, causing the CE light to come on. That's about another $600 to fix. Now, the battery and starter broke at the same time. I don't know how much it's going to be to fix it, but I'm not going to be able to drive it for about a week, maybe two. It is an extremely unreliable car. If you want to sink thousands of dollars into a car that might work, this is the car for you.

volvo,s40,2006,Bethanyraina, 06/21/2010,Such a dissappointment,4,"I was so excited when I bought this car. I have always wanted a volvo and did my research on what a great car this was supposed to be. I have had nothing but problems since I bought it. First the air didn't work, then the side mirrors wouldn't work. Then the AC didn't work again. At least all of that was covered by warranty. Now, after 4 years and no warranty, the entire electrical system is failing, telling me the air bags will deploy, brakes don't work, its locked me in and out of the car numerous times, alarm goes off for no reason. It will cost me close to 3k to fix. This shouldn't happen after four years. Very disappointed, and will never buy a volvo ever again."

volvo,s40,2006,deuce316, 02/24/2010,This car is a lemon!,2,Within the first year of owning this car it had to be flatbed towed due to a faulty steering column. The doors and locks would not respond to either the key or the controls inside the car. Volvo looked at it 3 times before they could determine the problem.I had to drive there while the problem was happening to prove I wasn't crazy. I have 60k miles and I have to spend $1600 on a new clutch and clutch slave cylindar. the car is 4 yrs old and just over the warranty. Volvo will not take any ownership of the costs. A clutch should not break in 4 years. I am a very experienced standard transmission driver and it was not due to my handling. This car is a money pit! stay away at all costs.
volvo,s40,2006,DMark, 06/16/2010,A Ford in Sheep's Clolthing,3,"Overall, a good vehicle for the money. Economy is great (we're getting 32+ mpg on the open road), and features for a small car are good. The Hallmark of a Ford is crap fasteners, and to that end this s40 wears the Mantle of it's once parent company very well. Trunk lid liner fasteners strewn in the trunk, interior panel fastener hanging loose, window base trim. I automatically push it back in now as I reach for the door handle, lower front grill fastener never has been aligned, headlamp washer almost pops back into the correct location, and an external air temp gauge that sporadically reads 20 degrees low (of course, it functions normally at the dealer)."
volvo,s40,2006,LJ, 06/01/2018,Don't risk buying this S40,3,"Volvos are great cars but the S40 has a electronic control module issue that has not had a recall. I've had my S40 since 2005 brand new & now here in 2018 149,500 miles later its having a major electrical issue. While driving the gages will shut off so you wont know what speed your going or how much gas is in your car. Many warning lights will appear such as (ABS, AIRBAG, BRAKE & BRAKE FAILURE) The S40 will not start on the try most days you would have to make several attempts until it starts. ITS A MAJOR HEADACHE!!! Volvo wants $1400 for the replacement of the control module.

volvo,s40,2006,jeremybennett8, 11/11/2008,Great buy great ride,4,"I bought my S40 used still under warranty after looking at buying a new one. The 6 speed is awesome and a great fuel saver. Power and handling are ample and safety features are unparalelled. Driven right you can have fun and get over 23 MPG. Be warned: spacial reasoning is a must. The trunk is hard to  while backing up as are the rounded front corners.  Factory premium sound will blow your ears off if you want it to.  Nav system is good with steering wheel mounted controls, though this can be distracting at times. I recommend 17"" wheels at the minimum to improve grip if you plan on driving aggressively."

The sound system is great going down the street listening to 50 cent. I just bought 18 inch chrome rims and the car looks even better. I could not ask for a better car for a 17 year old.

My chief complaints were all the noises, especially during warmer months. The clutch creeked so loud it sounded like a barn door (even after the dealer fixed it multiple times). Then the air compressor was noisy (almost ""breathing"") even when it was not in use and then the windows didn't seal up quite right resulting in air gaps and noises. Occassionally, my CD's would get stuck for a few days.  I would still recommend this vehicle despite it's little quirks."

The first few months of driving the car the a/c broke and the software in the car had a glitch. The locks and the windows on my driver side would not work I had to crawl thru the passanger side. My a/c works now but it only gives you cool air not cold, so its really bad on a really hot summer day. The plastic linning in my door is pooping up, so everythime I try to get in the car I trip on the popping up plastic. I would not recomend this car to anyone, yeah its a good looking car but the quality is terrible. Very let down! I wish I never got this car, it's a lemon! "

My T5 was the perfect car when it wasn't at the dealer for every little interior/electrical thing.  The motor was GREAT and VERY fuel efficient (30+ mpg)  Tons of torque, very comfortable, safe, handled good, very classy and different.  Really loved this car but it was a royal headache of tiny issues (10 dealer repairs in 1 year...all different interior/electrical quirks).  Being a Volvo owner I was used to little problems but it was a huge inconvenience spending all my time at the dealer (probably once a month).  I still love that car but I sold it when the warranty ran out.  Really a shame."
volvo,s40,2006,tkbindpls, 03/22/2006,A joy to drive and look at,4,This is my first Volvo and it's much more solid than my Saab.  This car is a dream on the highway; I can drive long trips and not be uncomforable or exhausted at the end of the trip.  It's also very nimble at highway speeds.  The turbo 5 cylinder is slow to start (no surprise) but I have to watch my speed after that.  I prefer manual transmission and I really don't like the clutch; the spring needs to be redesigned because it causes me to let it up too fast sometimes.  I'm so pleased that I joined the Volvo Club Of America.

Currently experience a popping noise when turning every once in a while - still hasn't been corrected. Gas mileage is okay - not as great as my VW Golf, of course. I'm hoping for a Volvo hybrid!"

volvo,s40,2006,bbradley, 11/24/2008,Made From Volvonium,4,"I bought the S40 T5 ""slightly used"" at the beginning of the year; it never let me down once. The car looks cool without being flashy and the interior is smartly designed. It just plain runs and is sturdy as an ox. It even has above-average pickup for such a tiny 4-door packed with so many options. Unfortunately, 10 months later due to some questionable road conditions I got intimate with a concrete wall. The Volvo wasn't exactly indestructible-- the entire driver's side was smashed in. I was a bit smashed in myself, but thankfully nothing permanent. I'm convinced that the Volvo saved my life. I'm driving a clunker today, but you can bet that I'll be a Volvo customer for life."

With the rear split seat folded down, I can fit 3 people and 3 sets of golf clubs.   Other than routine maintenance and a few recalls, the vehicle has not been to the shop."

Got a great deal from my local Seattle dealer.  The salesman was great too: no pressure, easy to work with, gave me all the necessary info to help me make a solid decision, etc.  I highly recommend this car.  It rides great.  It feels safe and well made. The layout of controls is excellent. A buddy has an Audi A4 (way too many of those in Seattle, BTW) and you are overwhelmed with dials, switches, and readouts.  The Volvo S40 has a simple yet elegant controls layout.  Kudos Volvo engineers!   I highly recommend this car."

volvo,s40,2006,Barbara, 03/14/2006,I Love My Swede,4,So far this car has been awesome and incredibly so was the experience of purchasing the vehicle--they treated me like a Queen
volvo,s40,2006,LOVE IT!!!!! , 04/11/2006,BEST compact car ever!,5,"I went on a ""rainy"" day just to keep it safe and not make a purchase knowing i had other cars to consider. Well, that certaintly didn't work as planned because once I drove the automatic knowing I ONLY wanted a manual in the rain, I could not believe the stability. I felt so safe cause I'm such a chicken when it comes to driving in the rain that it sold itself! Though I'm so picky I had to do a special order (Manual, Red, Climate, Sport & Select Pkg w/ beige interior) and can't wait for it to come from Europe. The premium sounds is out of control too. It's going to be a looker. I must say it's a chicks car- Definitely!"
volvo,s40,2006,CoaChKsCar, 04/21/2006,I'm in Love!,4,"I have always wanted a Volvo of my own and I have no regrets now that I have one!!  I have never felt as safe in a car after owning a Saab 9000, a VW Jetta and a Scion tc.  It is solid and flawless and handles so well in questionable weather.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I will never buy anything other than Volvo again.  Its engine is powerful and the control is amazing.  The interior design is slick and incredibly functional and the sound system is great.  Im a soccer coach so being able to fit all of my crap in the trunk is a must and this car definitely fills that need!!  If you are considering this car I have nothing but strong recommendations for it!!  "
volvo,s40,2006,PA-NYC_Volvo driver, 04/22/2006,Fun AND Comfortable on long commute,5,"Never gave Volvo a thought until I test drove this car and was I impressed.  I test drove the BVW 3series, Audi, Honda, Acura and was suprised to find that this car was actually fun, quick and handling was comparable to its competitors.  Did I mention fun...Hold on when the turbo kicks in...got to remember to lay off the accelerator at times!  It maneuvers/responds superbly in and out of tight city traffic or interstate traffic.  The one hour drive is very comfortable especially after a 13hr work day.  Besides, I couldn't have gotten a fully loaded vehicle w/ so many options I didn't think were necessary but now can't do without for less than 30K....definitely not the other mentioned vehicles"
volvo,s40,2006,s40 blue, 05/08/2006,Great car,5,"I bought this car in February and it is a wonderful car. I have nothing but great experiences with this car, tons of compliments and the dealership I bought it from was awesome"
volvo,s40,2006,osxboi, 05/09/2006,Everything I hoped and more,4,"Had mine built to order -- about 10 weeks from order to delivery, and it was sure worth the wait. This is an awesome vehicle. With the 218/236 turbo, power is great. With the Sports Package, handling is superb -- 17"" wheels and sport-tuned suspension. This little baby puts out when you most need it, like dodging lanes in rush hour traffic and on-ramp merging on interstates. Build quality is excellent. In three months I haven't had a single problem. Everything works. Design is far superior to anything American, Japanese or German. Get this car if you want a good price, performance and lots of stares."
volvo,s40,2006,Will Johnson, 06/29/2006,Volvo for life! - BUT......,4,"I really wish it had better gas mileage. Avg. 20 mpg in the city (Ugh!) Overall, this car ROCKS! In Germany these are everywhere, but here in the U.S., I get compliments at red lights all the time. Looks sharp with sporty 18""s on them. The interior is awesome. I'm 6'3"" and have plenty of leg room. Good trunk space. Somehow, the Swedes packed all that interior room in this little car! (very deceptive lol) Dolby II Sound system."
volvo,s40,2006,me, 07/23/2006,I love this car - my 3rd Volvo,4,"I love this car - Many improvements over my last S40 - Beautiful car!! The only problem is that the electric driver's seat doesn't go back far enough (and I'm 5'2""). I miss my Turbo -- what was I thinking!? The car is gorgeous - the only design defects are that I hit the wipers everytime I go near the key, the front window buttons are too far up (I keep putting the back windows down instead), bad blind spots & I hate leather but need a sunroof - this is a difficult package. I would give up some of that trunk room to have more room in the back seat. The cup holders are awful - they should be covered & bigger. Great car despite design defect Get lots of compliments! Needs an alarm for sunroof!"
volvo,s40,2006,Tracy, 07/26/2006,Best Car I've Owned,5,"This car is by far the best car I have owned!  Comfort and reliability are hands down in the top 1% of its class. I love driving this car -- especially after I have driven another for any amount of time. It is a much smoother ride than my BMW 328i, and has better handling.  I traded my Mazda RX-8 in on this car and although reluctant to go from a sportscar to another sedan, I am so glad that I did!  This car is just as much fun to drive as the RX-8, but so much more reliable and comfortable!  And can comfortably seat 5 adults."
volvo,s40,2006,Mikey Z, 08/22/2006,Best Bang for your Buck,4,"My new S40 is incredible.  I am 23 pre-dental student who never gave a thought to a Volvo until a friend recommended it.  Now, I can't say enough about it.  Its safety features are incredible and beat the heck out of its competitors.  Not to mention that it rides very well, not too stiff, not too soft, but can handle curves and speed impresssivly well.  Bottom line, it is safe, sporty, fun, and looks hot."
volvo,s40,2006,Lauren Waitkus, 07/31/2005,Wonderful Car,5,"My Volvo S40 is the most comfortable car that I have ever driven in.  I am very glad that I purchased this vehicle.  It is rated as one of the safest cars, and I always feel safe when I am driving in it.  "
volvo,s40,2006,Greg Hocevar, 08/04/2005,Volvo continues to move up,4,"If you are looking for a safe, fun little car to drive, then this is the one for you.  Whether it be around town, on winding country roads, or on the freeway, this car performs as if it had the heart of a sports car (with a more comfortable ride of course). For the value, this will beat any BMW 3 series, any Mercedes C-Class, and any Infinity G class."
volvo,s40,2006,Steven, 08/17/2005,A Sporty Volvo,4,"We love this car!  It is our first Volvo so can't compare with previous models but compared to other cars I've owned this is the best.  Handles like a sports car, lots of power and really cool interior."
volvo,s40,2006,BRH, 08/18/2005,Bethany's Volvo S40,4,"The new S40 is NOT your father's Volvo! The recently revamped 2005 S40 has Volvo's signature elegance and class, yet -  despite its (somewhat boring) reputation for safety and reliability -- is incredibly fun to drive and punchy. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for class, excitement, and reliability at a price that is surprisingly easy-to-swallow. "
volvo,s40,2006,alison cramer, 09/07/2005,Ck engine light,4,Love the Car!  Very Sporty!  Check engine light has come on twice already with one time being something broken.  Wish MPG was a little better.
volvo,s40,2006,db4639, 10/04/2005,The 2006 T5 is Awesome!,5,"Overall, the 2005 Volvo T5 is awesome!  Some people thought I was crazy to go from a 2004 3-Series BMW to a Volvo, but the superb handling & luxurious feel of this car far surpasses the BMW.  The car is safe, reliable, powerful and very fun to drive.  The fuel economy is also a plus, as was the purchase price!  If you enjoy luxury at a reasonable price, the new Volvo is a must have!"
volvo,s40,2006,denise, 10/07/2005,First New Car,4,I just bought this car in June 05 and it was worth the money I spent.  I am a short person and this car really conforms to my height.  I have never been so comfortable driving in a vehicle before.  The gear-tronic is a lot of fun.  
volvo,s40,2006,Brandon, 10/13/2005,Awesome,4,"My 2nd car, was driving a 99"" Saab 9-5 before.  I love this car, the ""Sporty- S40"" as I call it.  The day I brought it home my sister fell in love with it and got 1 also.  They have great colors and the T-tec is sweet, everything comes right off it.  Not flashy interior, very classy and simple.  Get the sound package!!! 12 speakers it's insane!!! great clarity as well.  Although the 2.4i (my model) has 168hp 5 spd it is very quick (but if u have the extra 6 grand get the T5! 220hp 6 spd turbo).  I have the Mysterial Green it looks very nice with the tinted windows. Great value as well, the only car that is comparable is the Acura TSX, a friend has it (he enjoys my car better) well worth it!"
volvo,s40,2006,PassionRed, 10/15/2005,Not impressed!,2,"We have had our car for 6 mons, and everything that can go wrong has! I would not recommend this car most issues we have had are resolved in the 2006 model.....that is what I have read on-line. Simple things mastered years ago on cars made by US Mfgs like, Digital clock (can't keep time even after update), headlights shine ....where...not where we are looking, drink holders, that can't hold drinks, Interior door handles that scratch so bad it looks like you picked it up from the local junk yard!!!! The TIRES..we won't go there.......Don't have time to list them all, there are too many. Thanks, PassionRed"
volvo,s40,2006,06_S40_Owner, 11/12/2005,5th Volvo - Best Yet,4,"This is the best Volvo I've ever owned (240, 850, V70, XC90).  It is extremely quick, holds a corner very well, very small turning radius and great fun to drive.  I drove every car in this class and this is the best deal for the money.  The new '06 Lexus IS feels like you are driving a casket, no sound, no feedback, no feel, won't see the accident coming.  The BMW 3 is very nice but much more expensive when equipped the same and has such a vain ""look at me, poser"" quality not shared by Volvo.   Acura suspensions rattle your jaw and bones when rolling over a pebble.  This one wins by far just for the feel of driving it."
volvo,s40,2006,Shanny, 12/06/2005,lovin it,4,Very pleased with my choice - would highly recommend this car to anyone.  GREAT car for  new drivers/teenagers.  
volvo,s40,2006,andre, 02/15/2006,best new car I have owned,5,"This car is great.  I needed a reliable car and was sick of my 99 passat 1.8T breaking down all the time.  Went to the dealership Portland Volvo in Maine. Sales guy was great, before and after the sale.  I purchased a base model. It still has all the features I wanted. There is plenty of power in the 2.4i engine and it saves on gas.  After 10 years of VW's I am switching to Volvo. Last thing, you cannot get a car for under 25K that has all the safety features that the Volvo has.  "
volvo,s40,2006,JB, 02/19/2006,Great car!,4,"This is the best car I have ever owned. I have always owned 4-cyl cars, and I am amazed at what a difference 1 more cylinder makes. It feels rock solid and handles like a dream. Volvo safety combined with a great look, sporty styling. There is nothing about this car that I don't love - this is not your uncle's Volvo!"
volvo,s40,2006,Grant, 03/02/2006,"Luv my swingn ""SWED"" S40",4,"My wife and I bought our S40 in dec05 we have had a blast driving this car. we have had no problems just big smiles. The S40 gives a touch of class to the moderate spender. my wife drives it as her daily comuter and feels the Volvo sense of safety and good looks give this one a big thumbs up. Having had toyota's and Honda's  all our lives this one's a step in a different direction, you will feel the european touch inside and out. As you wind  through the canyons or comute on the freeway the sense of a high dollar sports car is what you get, without the price tag. We now have that car that sits in that driveway that gets the looks, you know the one it's the Volvo S40. Oh thats right it's mine! "
volvo,s40,2006,Ann Marie, 04/05/2006,Confidence on the Road,4,"I primarily purchased this car because I was looking for safety features. This car had them all. Although I was somewhat hesitant after my test drive because of the slightly limited rear view vision, I purchased the car. Within a week, I was comfortable driving the car & have been in love with it ever since. I am someone who has been afraid of driving & am gaining more confidence on the road each day. I love my navigation system & no longer panic if I take a wrong turn. The car is comfortable & steady on the road. I have never cared much about cars before, but now am really impressed. I am committed to this line and am sure my next car will also be a Volvo!   "
volvo,s40,2006,richard berstein, 04/30/2006,A Great Car,5,"Got a terrific deal-$28,400 list for $23,200! Handles great, and all the ""bells and whistles"".  A really solid feel, and great acceleration for a 5 cylinder. I couldn't believe I could get a Volvo for a price comparable to a Kia or Hyundai, both of which, in my view, are very much inferior."
volvo,s40,2006,Justin, 06/23/2006,I love this car!,4,"I ditched my dying '97 Dodge Avenger for the S40 T5 and haven't looked back.  The T5 is definitely the way to go.  My partner has a '06 3-series and I wouldn't trade with him for a second.  Styling, build quality and performance are top notch.  Only negative comment I have is the city MPG isn't that great.  Even then, I wouldn't hesitate recommending this car to anybody."
volvo,s40,2006,happyinnh, 06/28/2006,Love this car!,4,"You can't find a better car for the price.  All the features on my Volvo made it irresistible, heated leather seats, traction control, 6 CD changer with 12 speakers, sunroof, I love it.  It is so much fun to drive, I find that the 2.4L engine is enough for daily driving, it has good pickup and delivers a smooth ride.  I feel so safe when I get into this car, and it handles really well. "
volvo,s40,2006,Klappez15, 07/14/2006,So Far So Good,4,"I have had my s40 for a month now, but I have to agree with a reveiw above, everytime I drive it I have a huge smile on my face.  It looks good, drives nice, and for the price has just about every feature I could want.  I love the sound system, the comfort level, and the way the car looks. My first Volvo but probably not my last."
volvo,s40,2006,Martin, 07/18/2006,S40 & the Europan Delivery Program:BINGO,4,"After getting my car in Gothenburg, Sweden at the Volvo facilities, we discover Norway (the fjords & the mountain roads: Snow tempest in June !!!) and Southern Sweden. 3100 miles of Fun driving and beautiful scenic views. To test a new car, there is no such road in America. The T5 is fantastic, more power than I can expect, even the Base T5 you got plenty of equipment. Its a perfect car for couple, very good with 2 children, but maybe a little tight with 4 adults. I love my Passion Red S40 T5 and people look at it, even in Sweden (where 1/3 cars are Volvo!). Volvo European Delivery Program: Fantastic Program, Fantastic Car, Fantastic Trip !!!"
volvo,s40,2006,LaLu, 07/28/2006,The best car I've ever had!,4,"I love my S40! It is very stylish and different, but also super reliable and safe. I never thought I'd get hooked on Volvos, but I really am now. I just went out looking at new cars, but was drawn back to Volvo because nothing else compares."
volvo,s40,2006,Dyanna, 08/10/2006,My Volvo View,4,"Exterior look is what captured my attention. Could use a little more storage space inside. Excellent sound system. Loud air conditioning when above the middle mark. Minor adjustments could be focused on & improved, like electric window movement (rattle-some)better mileage for it's size and engine(5 cyclinder). Other than that. Love it and would recommend the S40 for the young out-of-college professional because it's about 10k less than the 3 series BMW, with all the similiar perks.  "
volvo,s40,2006,lisa, 09/12/2006,my new s40,4,"I thought I wanted a BMW then i looked at the volvo s40 and fell in love with it, it's fun to drive, it has the speed and pick up when i want it and handles nicely, my daughter wants it, shes 13!!! I love owning a Volvo and feel safe."
volvo,s40,2006,Mary , 09/13/2006,Great Car,4,"Driving is fun, safety is superb, look is sleek...as my 20 year old son told me...""Mom, you got yourself a sexy little car!"""
volvo,s40,2006,Paul Margolis, 09/16/2006,"Weird Sounds, Other Troubles-a Mistake!",2,"This is my third Volvo (740 960 and now S40)  I am very disappointed with the quality and support from volvo.  Pressure sensor was bad inside gas tank and fixed by dealer.  The car makes very annoying Owl-like sounds, which the dealer has not fixed. Supposedly volvo is working on a computer software fix.  The clock occasionally resets itself--another annoying feature.  Save your money for a higher quality car. Do not expect any help from Volvo when you complain....apparantly Volvo has lost all class after having been bought by Ford."
volvo,s40,2006,Matt, 10/12/2006,"Great car, even with a few flaws!",4,"I absolutely love this car!  I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out for the test drive.  Sharp looking and gets lots of attention.  I really only have 2 issues with the car.  First, city mileage isn't what I expected it to be.  I do almost all of my driving in-city and find myself at the gas pump more than I expected.  Second, the rear brakes have started to squeal when backing up, and the problem seems to be a mystery.  I've had the car in twice (with a 3rd looming).  I've done some checking online and found my problem, while not widespread, is not unique to my car either (no solution ID'd).  It's a frustrating issue that I shouldn't be dealing with on a car 4200 miles in."
volvo,s40,2006,Redster, 10/15/2006,My baby,5,I love my s40. I drove the audi a4 and the bmw 3 seriess and the s40 is a million times better to drive and a lot nicer in inside design
volvo,s40,2006,mrrk47, 11/02/2006,A great car for the money!!!,4,"The S40 puts you in a European sedan for a lot less than Audi or BMW, and without compromising too much. The ride and performance have lived up to my expectations and everyday I have it I like it more and more. Almost 6000 miles and no problems, mileage has been okay for a 5cylinder and the feeling of safety just exudes from every cranny of this car. The S40 gives a very rewarding ownership exp. for someone who has had hondas and fords until now. I'm very happy I chose the S40 over my other choice...06' Accord! "
volvo,s40,2006,Kennedy, 11/28/2006,Best car for the money!,5,"I have had 47 cars and I really like the way this car handles.  Best dealership in town.  I would highly recommend this car if you are in the market! Very comfortable, reliable, dependable and the interior is awesome!  "
volvo,s40,2006,snead_c, 12/29/2006,Excellent Value,4,I replaced a Subie STi with my Volvo.A definite step down in performance but necessary at this time. I'm very pleased with my overall experience with the car. It gives over 30 MPG on the highway and is very comfortable to drive. 
volvo,s40,2006,VolvoNut, 04/01/2007,Another Success From Volvo,4,"This is an outstanding car.  Having owned four Volvos prior to this one (144, 164, 245, P1800), I have to say that the S40 (T5, AWD, 6-speed) is my favorite.  The drivetrain components are solid: strong acceleration, consistent stopping power, and smooth shifting make for an enjoyable driving experience.  Unlike the older turbos, this one is not subject to the same kind of shock-cooling that damaged earlier models back in the 80s.  The clutch takes some getting used to.  It is very light, but it grabs rather quickly.  Having endured intense snow in Denver this year, the AWD came in rather handy.  With DTSC, it handled beautifully."
volvo,s40,2006,dana, 12/06/2007,Driving in the snow,4,"This is my first Volvo. I have previously owned SUVs and also similar sized cars, like the Accord and a Camry.  This car handles great on drive pavement. I love the zippiness and great gas mileage.  Overall, it is a wonderful car.  However, it does not handle well in snow or rain.  In fact it is just a step better than a RWD car.  This is my second winter with this car and I am so dissappointed.  "
volvo,s40,2006,Patch, 04/08/2008,Volvo S40 Fits the Times,4,"I am 6 foot 2 and was looking for a fun car with a stick and I am so glad my wife found the S40. A former motorcyclist with many miles in Europe under my belt, I was conditioned against a Volvo. The bigger sedans were always driven by drivers who really need the protection of the cage if you get my drift.  I was pleasantly surprised by the roominess of the interior on test drive:  all three kids fit snugly in the back, the truck was ample, and the handling nimble. Compared to my bikes and other cars, my previous car in the US was a 1991 SAAB Turbo SPG, the little blue car felt spunky but a tad underpowered - sadly the Turbo doesnt come in a stick.  42k later - still a great car at 28mpg!"
volvo,s40,2006,Marcie, 05/14/2008,Great car,4,"It's a good looking car that handles great and so far is very reliable. Interior is nice, comfortable, nice seats and stereo system."
volvo,s40,2007,Ben, 03/16/2016,"Great Car, Expensive to Maintain",4,"I purchased this car with 53,000 miles on it and absolutely loved it. I have done everything with this car from fun corners and ""quick"" driving to driving through blizzards. This car unfortunately was only held back by the exorbitant maintenance costs and its relatively small size. I am 6' 8"" and purchased the car because I was sick of driving big cars but have recently dealt with back pain from the seating position, all my friends find it incredibly comfortable but I am simply to tall for it. The maintenance is an unfortunate story. After having purchased the car in brand new condition (53,000 miles) I have put about 20,000 miles on it in the last year and spent close to $8,000 in repairs. The most painful of which was the dual mass flywheel and clutch which cost $3200 alone to replace from the dealer. The clutch paired with new suspension, new brakes, new front struts, new tires, and a steering wheel lock incident have created the most expensive (car maintenance) year off my life. So alas I must let the poor thing go, but I have to say if you get lucky, or don't mind spending the money on maintenance, the car is excellent fun and will get you through anything, from driving through 6inch deep snow without chains or studs, to the pounding rain of Oregon winters. The car is simply excellent fun.
"
volvo,s40,2007,nikman, 10/03/2006,Great Ride! needs some storage,4,"Love the 2007 Volvo S40. Handles great, gets good gas mileage, and what a joy to drive! The only downfall is cabin storge. no place for cd's coins, Ipod, etc.  Other than that, not a thing to complain about. All controls are centrally located and simple to operate. The base model comes with power everything, except seats. If your looking to take a step up from a honda accord, or toyota camery, the 2007 volvo S40 is the car for you! Enjoy!"
volvo,s40,2007,Zeke, 07/14/2017,"Fantastic, but expensive",4,"As a long time owner with a very high mileage car (200,000 miles), I can attest that this is a very reliable car. Even with how many miles my car has on it, it still tighter and better performing than some new cars. However, this is granted if one pays for the enormous maintenance costs, especially at higher mileage. This car doesn't ever break... it just reaches times when parts naturally wear out and need replaced as per the routine maintenance schedule. But these parts are all very expensive, and all break at once. I cannot complain about the drivetrain, as it has been fantastic. I mean this: I have had no repairs on the engine and transmission the entire time I've owned it. The majority of my extreme maintenance costs have been suspension related. All of the control arms and wheel bearings broke at the same time, as did the shocks and struts. Close to 5 grand in repairs. If you wish to run this car correctly, it takes only synthetic oil, and only premium gas. The nose-bleed expenses aside, this car is a true gem to drive and has never let me down on the road. Always has loads of grip. Has driven through its fair share of blizzards, torrential downpours and sunny days. Is always just as fun and comfortable as the day I bought it. In summary, this car is like a sick pet: it costs you a lot at the vet, but it was money well spent because you love it, and want it to be around for years to come.
"
volvo,s40,2007,volvo84, 12/08/2012,MOST RELIABLE VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED,5," I purchased my 2007 Volvo s40 in late 2007. The vehicle had less than 5,000 miles and was in perfect condition. I have always been an import buyer yet never owning a Volvo I was a little skeptical. 




 The i5 provides the car with more than adequate power. The acceleration was great and I never had any problem overtaking other vehicles. 





As the title of the review says, the s40 was literally the most reliable car I have owned. For the 3 years I owned the s40 and putting upwards of 130,000 miles on the odometer, I forgot what it was like to have my car reparied. No problems with anything other than a right front wheel bearing. "
volvo,s40,2007,joe, 11/07/2006,Great feel for the money,3,"This car has been a pleasure since driving out of the dealership. Feel of quality inside and out. My last car was a bmw 325 and this has more comfort and room not to mention a better price. I have the 2.4 Which has adequate acceleration but if your looking for a little more getup go with the higher hp engine. Feels similar to the audi a4 as far as handling and inside space, with also a much better price tag. Controls were simple to use and everything has elegant simplicity about it. Go with the premium sound system."
volvo,s40,2007,Andrew B, 09/24/2015,Do not buy this car w/ more than 100k miles,3,"My the 2.5T back in college w/ 75k miles because we got a good deal from a friend at a dealership.  Drove fine until we hit about 110k and then it was one repair after another.  My wife has sentimental attachment to the car, but I would get rid of it tomorrow if I could.  It is a mediocre car that calls itself luxury - decent power, decent interior, decent handling, poor brakes, outdated infotainment even for the time...nothing great about the car.  Over the past year we've easily put $5000 in non-routine repairs and have experienced several breakdowns.  One was a software update which the dealer never notified us of.  If you want a luxury car spend a few grand extra for a beamer or audi, if you want a reliable car (which has basically everything the volvos do minus a little power) get a Honda or Toyota.  Will never get another Volvo.  Also get mediocre MPG for the power offered.
"
volvo,s40,2007,Rich, 10/01/2006,"Sleek, sexy, and sporty S40",4,"This car is fantastic! Mine has a silky smooth 6 speed manual transmission that is quick out of the gate. I have experienced next to no turbo lagged from the peppy 2.5 litre. Quick accelaration and the feeling of a more expensive German sedan make this Volvo a great choice.  The interior is sleek. Simple and elegant is Volvo's game. And Volvo wins with this S40. The owner's manual recommends 91 octane fuel, but 87 delivers nearly identical performance and fuel economy. Besides the car, my dealership experience was fantastic. Thank you Gengras Volvo - East Hartford, CT! "
volvo,s40,2007,JG, 10/03/2010,CPO - Very Reliable,4,"I purchased this car with approx. 20000 mi CPO from my local dealer. I have changed the oil every 5000 mi, not factory recommended 7500. I now have 82000+ miles on the car.  I've only had to take it in twice for repairs. Once for something very minor and the second time for the A/C going out intermittently on very hot days in South GA. Thank goodness it was CPO! They replaced the compressor (with new clutch assembly) and it is good as new. (Would have cost a mint had it not been covered under the extended warranty - $1200+)  Overall, good entry vehicle into the premium compact sedan market. The 2.4i could use 20-30 more HP, but the MPG is great. Average 27 mixed. 31+ Highway. "

I did the 113,000 service dealer stated in great condition.  I've replaced  upholstery on the front driver seat, a couple bulbs, if you can live with the 2.4 motor on the street, on the highway it's a fun car and will keep up with almost anything.

However I currently have 45k on mine, it's a stick and its a blast to drive. Mine is red so it attracts the looks and questions.
Great gas mileage about 28-32 respectively, it's been driven on some back country roads where traction was an issue and handled it great, snow no problem. All I have done is the oil changes, synthetic blend when The light tells me too..great car, fun to drive, has a little road noise but I replaced the tires and so far so good.

Now having said all these good things nothing btw go wrong. "
volvo,s40,2007,volvo2007dgo, 12/25/2011,4.5 years later 2.4 liter with Automatic,5,My S40 will be five years old in June. I have 32500 miles on it. It is only used for personal use. This was an excellent purchase. I would buy this car all over again. I use 93 octane gas and the performance is much better. I think i get better gas mileage using 93 than 87. The seats are so comfortable. Everyone that gets in my car loves the comfy seats and the waterfall dashboard effect where you can store something. There is plenty of power in the 2.4 engine without the turbo as long as you use 93 octane. The engine also loves the fully synthetic oil. The car has been reliable and i found a great volvo specialist to service it. I love the brakes and transmission.
volvo,s40,2007,Luke, 07/04/2007,Great car - true Volvo reliability?,4,"I've had the car for about 3 months and am a fairly satisfied customer.  I spent several months debating between an Audi A4, BMW 325xi and finally settled on the S40.  Considering cost, performance, reliability, etc., the Volvo appeared to come out on top.  The car worked flawlessly until last week - 2 fault codes: #4 injector failure and evaporative canister purge.  Let's hope the dealership service is as good as its reputation. Only drawback so far - poor fuel economy, even with 91 octane.  21 city, 26 hwy @ 65 mph.  Still optomistic at this point."
volvo,s40,2007,jamiefg, 07/24/2013,45K Mile Disappointment,3,"I purchased a 2007 Volvo S40 for safety and design. I've been very happy since! I just picked up my car 2 weeks after a 45K mile checkup at Volvo and was devastated to learn that I had nearly $3,000 of repairs needed. I take great care of my car and was not expecting anything other than the basic oil change and repairs at such low mileage. I am extremely disappointed at this point, and afraid of the thousands of dollars I may need to sink into my car in time. Beyond, the Volvo service team was charging me twice as much as my family mechanic - and quickly met his pricing once I brought it up. I loved my car, but I also want a company I can rely on and trust for 100K miles!"
volvo,s40,2007,Brad, 06/12/2018,The coolest piece of garbage on the roads today,3,"We have owned the car for 3 years. It comes from a 1-Owner, well-maintained family. While we do not do our service at the dealer, all of the maintenance is done locally with a well-rounded technician or mechanic. In the 3 years we have owned it, we have poured well over double what we paid for the car ($5000). Motor mount, spark plugs, coil packs, gas cap, headliner, front outlet, headlights, interior door panels, high mounted brake light, and many....many....MANY...more items. This car is super safe, and has incredible A/C and Heat, and the sound system ROCKS. Its gas mileage is nothing impressive, and the amount of effort this thing takes to run at highway speeds, you might need earplugs. If you are looking for a car the keeps you on your toes, best friends with the dealer and autopart stores, and potentially ending your marriage over the argument of buying it, then this car is for you!

The s40 is an amazing vehicle, it is comfortable, safe and has to be the nicest looking compact sedan on the market. Only complaint is the power, mine was a 5 speed manual, and I had plenty of power, however my wife still has her automatic and something gets lost with the same engine mated to the auto, even with the 'manual' mode. I really have no idea what Volvo is thinking in phasing out the manuals from their V50 and S40 lines, what a stupid move.  Other than that, we have high regard for all of our Volvos.

3 years. Volvo has done nothing to identify the problem other than make me pay for new batteries.

This is the second S40 I've owned, the first being a 2004. Never again will I buy a Volvo. The car has been in the shop 18 times. I strongly urge anyone considering this car to think twice.

I got the base model with only the automatic transmission, but it still comes with a lot of features like keyless entry, CD player, etc.  When I first got the car, the fuel economy seemed pretty lousy, but 5 months and 5000 miles later it seems to have improved tremendously.  I have taken 87 octane since day one and the car performs quite well with it.  The pickup is terrific for the 2.4L engine, although once or twice I have had to floor the pedal in order to make a quick pickup on a freeway merge.  The handling of the car is quite good as well, although during sharp turns the car feels slightly wobbly... definitely not firm as a BMW 3-series.  "

volvo,s40,2007,1st time Volvo owner, 10/08/2019,Such a disappointment,2,"I bought this car used in impeccable shape,  it had 130,000 miles on it but looked and drove like it was brand new.  I would have easily bet it would have gone another 100000 miles before I had any trouble with it . The previous owners took really good care of it changing everything recommended  at recommended time. They logged it all down in the maintenance book.  Even down to the windshield wiper replacement.  
    It overheated once on my way home from work but warned me ahead of time & told me to pull over before it died.  I put a bottle of water in it to get me home as that was all I had with me.  Filled it up at home and drove for a co. More weeks before it did it again only this time it stalled and wouldn’t restart. Had to get it towed & found out the heads were cracked even though you couldn’t see it .  Do you think a replacement head for that car is easy to find .  Especially because we now can only afford to buy a used one.  Going to have to replace motor in order to make it usable . Very disappointing .  Broke down way too easy

We are averaging about 27 MPG city, and 34 MPG highway, with A/C. This should be an option for everyone who is looking at a 3 series BMW.

The mechanic that took my car in was blown away and said he had never seen anything like this. Nice clean oil rain out of the car and the small pieces that fell out of the motor were nice and shiny because there was no ""gunk"" in the motor due to the good service history.

volvo,s40,2007,John B., 11/06/2008,"Pleasant, but disappointing",4,"The S40 2.4i gets high marks for styling, fit and finish - very nice. The 168 horsepower 2.4 liter normally aspirated 5-cyl has plenty of pep. Fuel economy is on the low side - I averaged 23 MPG in mixed city/freeway driving. The standard suspension is tight and supple; goes right where you point it. The big disappointment is the electrical system. In the 1 1/2 yrs I owned the car I had three occasions where the car didn't recognize coded electronic key, and a series of erroneous indications of hood unlatched, lights burned out, etc. After awhile cons outweighed pros, and I lost confidence.

I have owned many vehicles, most recently a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse which treated me very well. Now I want a vehicle that is sporty, something I can grow with but also a sedan to appease my wife who insists that my car should have 4 doors. I took the Mitsubishi Galant for a spin, the Pontiac G6 and we already own a Ford Fusion and yet I didn't feel that any fit the bill. I pop into a Volvo dealership, look at a Black S40 and think to myself this is a nice looking car. The car handles great with quality material inside. I feel I am driving a premium vehicle! I AM!"

The driver's side visor is falling out of its socket when you turn it to shield your face from the sun coming in from the driver's side window.  Not something I would expect to find on a brand new entry-level luxury car.  Still, the car is great and the 170 hp on the base engine is plenty.  Features are well thought out and functional and ride is secure and supple. There could still be more/larger storage bins, which I hear they are taking care of with the 2008 models.  Other craftmanship appears good to great.  Hopefully the visor will be the only issue in a long, carefree life of the car"

I am 6'3"" and have been able to find a good seating position - I got the Select Package with power driver's seat.  Nice headroom even with sunroof. The power is adequate in the 2.4.  I have been pleased with the mileage although I am still in the break-in (city only so far - about 18-19 mpg) with optional auto transmission.  Optional 12 speaker stereo is fantastic.

I picked it up at the factory in Sweden (a fantastic deal that I would recommend to all), and drove it through Denmark, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Austria.  It is stable as a rock at any speed (my son pushed it up to 110 on the autobahn), handles responsively, accelerates acceptably, and has good fuel economy.  My onboard computer says I am getting 28.2 mpg overall, which I think is quite good.  I consider it to be a BMW 328 for 10K less.  (Yes, the BMW is superior in handling and acceleration.)  The factory pickup experience was so fun that I may never buy a car any other way."

My 2006 S40 was totaled but I only had a sore back for a couple of weeks. Having been an auto appraiser for 6 years I consider myself an expert on assessing damage. I am sure I would have had a major injury in most other cars of any size. I was so impressed with the way the car took the accident that my first choice was a 2008 S40.

First, the radio was super stylish in 2009, but now I wish it was easier to upgrade.  Second, it goes through batteries.  I haven't had the tire issues others complain of.  The REALLY good news is that I've been in two accidents and just shook them off.  Someone plowed into me and you can barely tell.  It's got that Volvo strength.  Second, I haven't had any mechanical issues.  I get it looked at by the dealer once a year, but outside of tire and battery replacements, I haven't had to deal with anything beyond regular upkeep.  I love this car and I want to keep it forever, assuming I can figure out a way to upgrade the radio.  It's so reliable. It still runs great at 10 years old.

volvo,s40,2008,topgeardreams, 01/11/2011,Great car for the value,4,"Recently picked up my 08 S40 T5 AWD. Compared to competition the value is great; higher rate of
depreciation means this is a good used car to pick up (if you're planning on keeping it for a while). You would have to pay much more for similar Legacy GT or Audi A4. Handling is better than most sedans, but not as tight as an A4 in the steering or suspension. Good enough for spirited driving. While climbing mtn passes turbo seems to make more than ample power on my way to Tahoe. Acceleration isn't great either at low or midrange. (Tranny on auto keeps revs low, so using the tiptronic helps) On snow and ice the Haldex type awd system performs almost invisibly. Overall a very good buy. 24mpg avg"

I have only owned the Volvo for a month,  however I can say that this is a very solid automobile.  The ride and handling are excellent.  The AWD gives a feeling of being glued to the road. I used the vehicle during a recent New England snowstorm and the car did not slide at all.  There was never any wheel spin.  The fit and finish are second to none.  The leather seats are extremely comfortable and can be adjusted for a perfect fit.  The car is solid for a smaller vehicle. It feels as if; it is cut out of a single piece of Swedish steel.  The interior design is simple and clean, yet elegant. The exterior design stands out."

Within the last month... Navigation quit working - dealer had to order a whole new head unit for it... Strange & Annoying rattle in the passenger side door - ended up being loose rivets that hold the window in the door.  They also did some software update as well.  This was all covered under warranty.  This car never seems to hold an alignment.  Just home today from having the 3rd alignment since I got this car new.

The seats are best in any class and the rear leg room is adequate for people who didn't lose their legs. The driver foot well is a bit narrow, thus an automatic transmission version is recommended. Although the model is 4 yrs old, the face-lifted 2008 has finally done justice for the lines and shape of S40. Its beauty and sophisticated design is up to par with other just released 2008 cars. An attractive Volvo, what has our world come to?! Anyway, you buy Volvo for its comfortable road manner and silky smooth ride.  BMW is no longer exclusive b/c they are everywhere."

People are often surprised when, at 26 years old, I tell them I purchased a Volvo - that is, until they see it. The Volvo name may carry the stigma of an ""old person's car"", but one look at the sleek design instantly extinguishes that thought. My black on black S40 turns heads and evokes positive reactions from family, friends, and co-workers. My expectations have been surpassed with this excellent vehicle."
volvo,s40,2008,Ted, 07/07/2010,"Great looking, reliable, average car",4,"Have been driving this car for over 2 years now. Love the overall look and build quality. Very different from other cars on the road.  A few issues, fuel economy, loud interior, and surprisingly more than one blind spot due to the large columns (it's a safety thing...I get it)  The drive is also not as European as I would have expected from a car competing with the likes of BMW, Audi and dare I say it, VW. It lacks that little oomph to get it at the same level as its German competitors.  It doesn't get me excited, it gets me from A to B in style and safely."
volvo,s40,2008,Martin, 10/28/2010,unexpected,3,"The car is good looking and runs well out on the road. However, we've experienced problems with this car like no other new car we've ever owned.  Had to replace rotors at approx. 18K miles. Not covered under warranty.  Had to have car aligned at 22K and replace tires as result of bad alignment.  Toed out and cupped tires which caused a terrible road roar.  Battery went dead at 2 yrs.  The only thing covered by the 4 yr warranty was the battery.  Expensive car to own.  Will never buy another Volvo.  Rough ride in the back seat(s)."
volvo,s40,2008,Sue Winners, 07/31/2018,Smallest Volvo with huge inside!,5,"The back seats fold flat giving huge space in back!  2 GSD's (big german shephard dogs) LOVE riding in back. (Windows not droolproof.) Gorgeous paint 10yrs outside parked. GREAT acceleration from 5 cyl engine... MORE than enough. Turbo feeling but not a turbo. Go figure. Large comfortable for 5'8"" person. Tall guy (6'2"") hates it. (No worries he wants to drive it.) Easy in and out (somehow??) Great MPG. Feel safe inside. Take good care of it and it will reciprocate!

volvo,s40,2008,Cdydatzigs, 04/20/2009,The perfect cure for turning 30.,4,"Growing up in the 1980's, Volvos were known as the boxy yuppy-mobiles that your hip friend's parents drove. Nowadays, the cars are still hip but they are far from boxy. The S40 is the perfect entry-level sports sedan for the post-college crowd. The car is very attractive but you can still tell the car is a vault under its skin. Huge door pillars and the comforting thud when the doors close tell you this is still one of the safest cars on the road. Materials inside are durable and attractive, and the controls are very easy to read. There is some turbo-lag off the line, but when yer cruising at 25 mph on the freeway on ramp and need to get to 75mph in a hurry? This car flies at mid-range."
volvo,s40,2008,Chris G, 08/18/2009,Jeep to Volvo... what Jeep?,5,Haven't loved a car this much in many moons.  Had a 2008 4 door Jeep Wrangler Sahara loaded.  Fun in summer.  Fun in winter.  An uncomfortable disaster the rest of the year.  Then... the Volvo S40.  WOW.  Fun ALL THE TIME! and looks and performs beautifully.  What a deal too.  Was an untitled demo.  Sticker $27K.  Bought it at $23K and they paid off my Jeep.  Why didn't I choose Volvo sooner???  Safe.  Stylish.  Fast.
volvo,s40,2008,dcompain, 11/19/2007,Great First Car,4,"This is my first new car after graduating college.  Before this I drove a 2002 E46 330i on occasion, but my own car was a 1986 BMW 635CSi.  As a BMW gearhead, I never saw myself in a Volvo, but the car represents an excellent value.  There is a lot of performance (I have 5-sp manual), style, comfort, and feature content for the money.  I have similar features as a BMW 328i for $10k less, and I actually enjoy the unique style, as a 3-series are a dime a dozen today.  The ride is very smooth while still delivering road-hugging performance.  As my first front-wheel-drive car, I appreciate the all-weather abilities as well.  "
volvo,s40,2008,Happy Pittsburgher, 09/01/2008,More Than Fair Value,4,"I narrowed onto this model as the best dollar value to replace one of our cars. While it does not have neck snaping acceleration, it is far from underpowered and it will snap your neck while cornering. Mileage on secondary roads is great, city is real good and highway if fantastic. Little negatives: no inside trunk relase or on the key fob and the doors do not automatically unlock when the key is removed."
volvo,s40,2008,atmf96, 01/02/2009,VW Lover Falls for Volvo,5,"I recently bought my first Volvo in Dec 08. This car is absolutely gorgeous, both inside and out. The exterior lines are very clean, and smooth. It gives the vehicle a sleek design, even sporty. It is easy to appreciate from all angles. And the interior is extremely comfortable. Leather seats are very soft and smooth, slightly fitted on the sides so you fit nice and snug. The layout of the console is simple yet robust. There isn't an abundance of knobs and dials to confuse you. In addition to great looks, the car drives great. It's very quiet at highway speeds, and the hi-performance audio sounds great. If you're looking for a sporty sedan, with clean looks inside and out, this is for you."
volvo,s40,2008,ericp, 02/22/2009,Just Purchased,5,"I just purchased my S40 in Feb 09. I never thought of owning a Volvo but the dealer had this silver brand new 08, the sticker was $27,400. They let it go for $19,000 so how could I refuse. So far it is a very enjoyable car. Simple and very strong! I wish it had about 20 more HP, however it still is a wonderful car. "
volvo,s40,2008,Dan, 04/06/2009,Volvo S40 - Highly recommended !!!,5,"I purchased a left over 2008 S40 about a month ago, mainly for my wife's use. What a car! We absolutely love it. We've both always owned domestic vehicles, but this one beats all of them in just about every way I can think of.  It has an overall great design, both inside and out. The comfort, feeling and handling of the car is superior than everything I have driven in the S40 price range.   Also impressed with crash test ratings. Now that we have experienced the quality of Volvo, I think it will be awhile until we go back to domestic. My vehicle is a Navigator, seriously thinking about trading it for a Volvo. Didn't think I would ever have considered that a few months ago!!"
volvo,s40,2008,CDY, 08/24/2009,"Sturdy, reliable",4,"Mileage is ok. Sporty ride. Not much space for the rear passengers. Small and sturdy. Noisy at low speeds. Got a dark grey car and black interior. great design even for cloth seats. Intuitive dials and controls. Nice programmable features like Autolock, rain sensing wipers, tail fog light, tow jack, homelink etc. "
volvo,s40,2008,Chris from NJ, 10/13/2009,Great Euro Design,5,"I bought the S40 just as I was finishing college...it's a great car and I am very happy with it.  I went from a Toyota 4Runner(which I LOVE...if I could have both I would) and do not feel like I have lost much space.  It looks and drives great and accelerates beautifully.  Being 6'1"" I need to put my chair relatively far back, limiting the space behind my chair.  Therefore, if someone is sitting behind me, there is very little space.  That's my only issue."
volvo,s40,2008,topgeardreams, 01/11/2011,Great car for the value,4,"Recently picked up my 08 S40 T5 AWD. Compared to competition the value is great; higher rate of
depreciation means this is a good used car to pick up (if you're planning on keeping it for a while). You would have to pay much more for similar Legacy GT or Audi A4. Handling is better than most sedans, but not as tight as an A4 in the steering or suspension. Good enough for spirited driving. While climbing mtn passes turbo seems to make more than ample power on my way to Tahoe. Acceleration isn't great either at low or midrange. (Tranny on auto keeps revs low, so using the tiptronic helps) On snow and ice the Haldex type awd system performs almost invisibly. Overall a very good buy. 24mpg avg"
volvo,s40,2008,Bing Yu, 10/09/2007,Excellent car,4,This is the first time I purchased a Volvo. I love its exterior look and interior design. The back seat is pretty roomy.  The 5 speed manual transmission is powerful and smooth. This Volvo S40 is really fun to drive.
volvo,s40,2008,James, 06/13/2008,Fantastic,4,"This car is fantasic. I have the 5 cylinder 2.4i and I love it! It has more than enough power to speed my car up to equal that of anyother car on the road. I live in the north and it does wonderfully in the snow. Being a Volvo it is extremely reliable, and it perfect for the new driver in our family. It is my 16 year old's car and we feel very secure with him driving this car around. The car just has that safe feel about it: the doors are thick and heavy, there are numorius airbags and rides very smoothly. Interior is beautiful, the car is fully loaded and the sterio is louder than anyone could stand to hear. I believe this is the new luxury car."
volvo,s40,2008,URSUS, 06/21/2010,small but cool,4,I bought the S40 couple months ago and i like it ..European car always the best ..
volvo,s40,2008,Dave D., 09/10/2007,Loving It for Now,4,"I have only had it for a couple of weeks so I can not say much about the reliability, but the overall look and feel of the Volvo S40 is everything I was looking for. If you want a smaller refined looking ride that has some speed and handling, look no further. The S40 has a classy but still young and sporty feel to it. For people my age (26) it fits perfectly. The only con is that people looking for a sporty manual transmission the Volvo is not a good pick, but the Five-Speed Geartronic Transmission is very satisfying."
volvo,s40,2008,Jennifer, 05/28/2009,Great Car,5,"The VOLVO S40 AWD Tubo is awesome.  I enjoy every mile I have done so far. It drives well, handles well and is a attractive looking car. I highly recommend the VOLVO S40.  It is a great driving experience."
volvo,s40,2008,37, 01/05/2008,The Most Pleasing,5,"We have had low end to high end and we were never really satisfied.  Then we found this unsuspecting Volvo 40.  What a champ.  It's quick, fun, just the right size for what we need.  Rated safe, its simple yet stunning.  By far the best stereo (dyna-audio), excellent turning radius, comfortable and supported seats.  This premium compact offers more than you would think.  Get the T5 AWD with the bells and whistles you'll be glad you did. "
volvo,s40,2008,cwilsong, 06/26/2009,Love this CAR!!!,4,"Just finished one year with my S40 awd and I can say for the first time in a LONG time I really LOVE my car and feal I got a great deal as well.  Loads of power, fun to drive and very quiet. Probably even has a better sound system than I have at home.  Best part though was that we did an OSD and picked up the car direct from the factory. Not only got exactly the car I wanted at a better price than here but got to spend 3 weeks driving it around Europe.  If you are thinking about any Volvo you owe it to your self to look into OSD. Not all dealers push it as they get a fixed fee for handeling the sale but there are several Internet dealers out ther that can help you. "
volvo,s40,2008,Colorado Ms, 03/11/2008,Rocky Mountain Sleek,4,"Love it, Love it, Love it. Living at 9200 feet in the Rocky Mountains, I was concerned how it would fare. But it handles snow and ice better than my SUV did.  Great handling and hugs the road- the car almost drives you. Interior is sophisticated and very comfortable. Congrats to Volvo for the sleek and modern body design.  This car feels solid unlike most small sedans out today.  For the quality, safety, and options found on this car you would have to pay thousands more if you bought another make. "
volvo,s40,2009,Lee, 03/13/2009,Good Volvo Starter Car,4,"I bought this car after recommendations from friends.  I previously owned a Passat.  My Passat got 37 MPG (Diesel).  My Volvo gets 24+/- (Gasoline).  The S40 is very comfortable to sit in and I have a bad back.  I'm not too thrilled about some of the plastic trim in the interior but overall I like the European attention to detail.  There's not a lot of room in the back seat for adult kids but for little ones, it's ok.  I like all of the gadgets that come with the purchase price and there's not a lot of options to add on.  My Passat lasted 13 years and I fully expect the Volvo to do the same.  The dealership is very responsive and attentive.  A good car for the money."
volvo,s40,2009,Chuck, 01/31/2010,Good Solid Car,4,This is our third Volvo.  The other two were station wagons (over 15 years ago).  Purchased this for my 17 year old daughter as her first car.  I am impressed because it is sporty enough for her and it is still a solid little Volvo.  I just wish I could drive it sometime.
volvo,s40,2009,engrgrad, 08/03/2010,If you buy an S40 get the Turbo!,3,This is my first Volvo after owning a V6 Honda Accord.  I find the non-turbo very underpowered and an overall disappointment. Passing vehicles almost always requires the use of the auto-stick.  Seats become uncomfortable after long drives and climate control is very difficult to regulate.  I would recommend that you thoroughly investigate performance prior to purchasing
volvo,s40,2009,MITCHELL, 10/24/2009,Good Sturdy Car,5,"This the first Volvo I bought, I've wanted one since I was 19 yrs old,mainly because of the safety features and durability. I get about 27/29 MPG which was about the same as my Honda Accord, which was only a 4 cyl engine.  The seats are very comfortable,and the standard equip is great. I wanted a sports car, but after driving the S40 it proved to have the tight suspension that I wanted,but the comfort I needed and it had back seat in case we needed it.  My husband was a Ford man and after he drove my car home, he wanted one, so 5 days later we went back and bought another one. We are very pleased so far."
volvo,s40,2009,Shawn Reed, 03/08/2016,Fun run around vehicle,4,"I bought the car from my son. Fun to drive great handling, peppy, rides firm like most sports cars. Great mpg. Very few mechanical issues. Visually impressive lines.
"
volvo,s40,2009,EL, 08/10/2009,Good Car - Thought Not for the New Price,4,"My main beefs with the car is that the base engine is fairly weak for how heavy the car is. Throw that thing in a Honda Civic & it performs quite well. But you buy a Volvo for the solid build & safety ratings & it could afford a slightly more powerful base engine [~ 190hp?]... it shouldn't affect the fuel efficiency that much. The T5 isn't that much worse on the MPG's.  Otherwise, I agree with most of the reviews & the main reason I bought this car is because I bought a loaner vehicle from a dealership for a third off the MSRP. And that's a 2009 with 10k miles. Volvos depreciate so much & that makes it worth it. That pretty much sold me. And my wife wanted it. Maybe that was the reason."
volvo,s40,2009,albaad, 06/08/2012,Volvo S40 D 1.6 RDesign,2,"Do not buy!
I bought a Volvo when my daughter was born in 2009 selling my super reliant 1.7 Puma. 
The engine failed after just over 2 years. As I had had my 2nd year service late (less than 1000 miles) Volvo said the warranty was void. The customer care team refused to speak to me. 7 days after spending £6,000 on a new engine the new engine fails in the same way as the previous one. The car has been towed back to the garage. Having researched the engine, it is rubbish "
volvo,s40,2009,Tom, 01/22/2009,"Good, Safe Car",5,"This is the third Volvo I have had and it continues to be a fun, safe car to drive. My previous Volvo was totaled in a serious accident, and my child and myself walked away relatively unhurt. The safety features and peace of mind are why you buy a Volvo. The 2009 model is more expensive, but the standard equipment is wonderful. With the warranty being four years and the maintenance coming for 3 years, it is still a good value compared to lower priced competitors. Volvo for life!"
volvo,s40,2009,V.N, 08/02/2010,Awesome car,5,"Many people may think Volvo is all about their safety, although i was very impressed when i first bought my car and took it home from the dealership, my dad was also impressed being our 2nd Volvo we have bought, being 17 and first getting this car is excellent "
volvo,s40,2009,Rebecca M, 06/06/2020,Hot ‘lil car,5,"I bought the Volvo S40 from an individual (whom I had not met) from my hometown, so I knew the karma was right. I had previously owned a 240 DL sedan and was satisfied with the Volvo product. This peppy ride met all my expectations and then some. But after 6 years of driving a small car, I decided to part with it and move up in size to a small SUV, although not a Volvo. Even though this car is 11 years old, it still has a lot of life. A first car for a young driver, they will be impressed!

volvo,s40,2010,Earl, 09/07/2009,The best at the price,4,"Got the car early this year; first thing i noticed was the torque, i love the strength of the car,its powerful, good gearbox, bit of a hard drive,that just makes it more sporty. I am happy i bought it, it handles corners well for a fwd car. the motor makes that sound...nuts man,love it to bits"
volvo,s40,2010,Dave T, 07/22/2010,My second Volvo,4,"My first Volvo was a very used, ""beater"" 1966 122S, reliable as an anvil, quirks and all.  A few months back, after a lot of research, I purchased a 2010 S40 2.4i. After being severely injured in an auto accident I wanted a safe, practical, small car with good handling characteristics and decent performance.  I drove a C30, then an S40 and decide that the S40 was for me.  Besides daily driving I have logged 1200 miles on a road trip to Connecticut from Ohio and back putting in two 550 mile days in comfort.   "
volvo,s40,2010,thurstrw, 02/11/2010,Solid ride,4,"Picked up my S40 AWD R5 turbo in Sweden in early January.  Have driven it 1200 miles since, through a lot of snow and construction on the autobahns, as well as urban driving in tight European streets.  I love the stability of the car; it inspires more confidence than anything else I've had.  Corners very flat.  The acceleration is fine with me.  Great sound system."
volvo,s40,2010,R Johnson, 10/26/2010,2nd Volvo S40,5,"The 1.9% fin, maint covered for 5yrs/60K miles pursuaded me to buy 2nd S40 (prior being '06).  Ownership experience has exceeded every reasonable expectation.  With few exceptions (AC compressor), maint expense has been more than reasonable, considerably less than had I settled on another luxury make (considered BMW, Lexus).  Seating is very comfortable, interior asthetically clean and simple, dash/instrumentation very intuitive.  Subtle changes from my prior S40 is improved center console, USB/AUX/iPOD interface, Bluetooth, Satelite/HD radio, Auto- Climate control, BLIS.  performance/handling is tight and responsive, though not as that as the '06 (which had sport-tuned suspension)"
volvo,s40,2010,Lynette , 03/15/2010,My New Volvo,5,This car is great! It handles the lumps and bumps of New Jersey's winter worn roads with ease. I love the great pick-up and the nimble way it handles! The clutch shifts smoothly and is extremely easy to.  The instrument panel is simple to use as it is very logically designed.  I am really enjoying this car and am so glad I made the choice to purchase it.  
volvo,s40,2010,Larry, 04/13/2010,My Second Volvo S40 2010,4,"This is my second Volvo S40 and loving everything about it.  The style, fit and finish of this car is very nice.  It is a very solid well built car with every bit of safety in it.  I just traded in my prius because I wanted more comfort and safety.  I would rather pay more for gas and feel safe with my family in the car."
volvo,s40,2010,Larry, 04/01/2010,Well Built Car,4,"This is the third S40 in the family, my second.  This is the best money can buy at this time due to the 5 year warranty plan and discounts being taking off.  After driving a prius for the last three years I really have missed my S40, such a solid well made car.  Don't get me wrong, the only thing I'll miss about the prius will be the mileage.  You can't put a price on your safety and comfort so I am willing to pay the extra for that.  I now feel so much more relaxed when driving, I love my Volvo S40.  The safety car crash star rating sold me back into my S40.  My partner has had his now for five years and loves his as well, no major unexpected issues.  For what I paid you get a lot. "
volvo,s40,2011,Thomas, 12/01/2010,Luv It,4,"The s40 packs lots of class in a smaller vehicle, Very powerful with the T5 model and turbo engine. Duel exhaust a plus for style. One negative is inside storage. no a lot of room for sunglasses and tissues but the overall performance makes you luv it."
volvo,s70,2000,k_in_austin, 09/04/2011,Bought for the kids but now I'm keeping this one,4,"I love this car.
I did buy it initially as a safe vehicle for my teens but it drives so much better than my 2004 xc70.
This car is a hidden gem--the 2000 model year was the last year this was made, the last year of truly Swedish Volvos, way ahead of it's time with side curtain airbags, also quite luxurious.
Waited for a gem and found a base model with less than 100K, well cared for, bought for $4400.
Have had it for 1 yr.
I like that it is a great size, runs quietly, handles well, steering assist is just right, visibility terrific, seats comfortable."
volvo,s70,2000,first477, 04/19/2017,Last of great Volvos,4,"Overall this is a great car. I have the non turbo 5 speed automatic and I bought it used with 120,xxx miles. It now has 124,xxx. When I bought the car, I thought I was getting a stupid good deal, but as I owned it longer I realized why it was so dirt cheap. This is the kind of car you definitely to take good care of or else it will not take care of you. You really have to stay on top of the timing belt, oil changes, trans fluid, thermostat, etc, or else you have nightmares down the line. If you buy a turbo model, you definitely need to pay attention to how you drive the car to keep the turbo well maintained (drive it slow when its cold, let it run 30-60 seconds before and after shutoff/startup, etc). There are a number of things that can go wrong with the car that you have to be aware of. First is the heater core. If it fails, you're gonna lose of lot of coolant, fast, so watch your temp gauge and if it starts getting too hot, pull over and get it fixed so you don't blow your head gasket. Next is the Positive Crankcase Ventilation System. With age and mileage, it gets clogged up and it needs to be serviced. It's gonna set you back at least $300 if you do it yourself and you have all the tools you need, but it's upwards of $600-700 if you get an independent shop to do it. If you opt not to do it, and it needed to be done, you risk blowing either a crankshaft seal or a rear main seal, either of which means your car is basically totaled. If you change the oil often enough, you should be able to go a good long while before it needs to be serviced. If you find a car and you can't get documentation of recent repairs for the PCV system, timing belt, or heater core, you will need to have those serviced otherwise you'll be losing a lot of money when your car breaks. Also of importance, these transmissions are claimed to use a lifetime fluid, which is definitely not true. The fluid needs to be changed at least every 70,000 miles. The 2000 models without the turbo have an extremely sensitive Aisin Warner 5 speed automatic, and it definitely needs the fluid changed often. Its pretty easy to do to. The 4 speed automatics on the turbo models are a lot less sensitive but you still need to change the fluid often enough. Also, the suspensions in these cars wear out, so expect repairs around the 150-200 thousand mile mark. A very major problem with these cars that most people notice and are turned off right away is the squeaky dashboard. Yes, it squeaks like no other car I've ever been in. It's very unsettling, but it doesn't effect the drivability of the car and frankly I got used it in one week of driving it. There are fixes for it, but they're personally not worth the effort. Other little things are probably going to break on the car too. The overall build quality is not that good to be honest. If taken care of, it will serve as a wonderful, stylish point A to B car. /// How does the car drive? It's very comfortable and relaxing to drive. The seats are classic Volvo, very comfortable. The brake pedal has a good feel and it stops well. The gas pedal is touchy in the first 5-10% of the travel, but other than that, its a very good gas pedal. The steering is excellent overall. The weight is good, not terribly light but not heavy. It tries to turn all the way to one side when turned far, but it tracks straight well at smaller turn angles. As an added bonus, the turn radius is actually pretty tight. Handling is a little on the soft side, and you can tell it doesn't like to be driven fast in twists or corners. Acceleration is pretty average for a car of this size. The 5 cylinder engine sounds fantastic. Just go on youtube and watch some acceleration videos of s70s, 850s, etc, you'll see what I mean. Cruising rpm is a little high for my taste. Multiply the speed by 35 and that's the rpm in 5th gear. I personally think it could be lower. It's pretty
 quiet on the highway except for the squeaking. I drive very conservatively and I get about 24-26 mpg average. That's about 20% highway 80% city. I really like the styling of the car too. Inside and out looks gorgeous. I get complements from friends and family about how nice it looks.

volvo,s70,2000,Anonymous, 11/02/2010,They don't make 'em like this anymore!,4,"I've had my 2000 Volvo S70 GLT SE Turbo for 8 years (bought it used at auction) and it's going strong.  It has 105K miles and no sign of slowing down.  As this car ages, little things need fixing.  But the overall build and reliability are fantastic.  I stick to the suggested maintenance schedule and am told I can get 250K miles out of it.  I love the turbo's torque as much as the top end smoothness.  I've never owned a car this long and it's because I simply don't get bored driving it.  It's not much to look at, but when you're sitting on the inside who cares.   Bottom Line:  FUN to drive and it never breaks down.  Wish the S80 were a suitable alternative for when I finally trade it in. "
volvo,s70,2000,Amy, 07/05/2008,2000 Volvo GLT SE Turbo,4,I bought this car used at 136k miles. This car handles like a dream and the turbo gets you out of situations like people you like to box you in on the highway. The A/C however is intermitant and don't know why. Going to bring it in to get that looked at.  I want to feel safe with my new son and don't want a minivan and look like a soccer mom. There is plenty of space in the trunk for the stroller and groceries. I would recommend this car. 
volvo,s70,2000,s70_owner, 03/29/2016,Great Car for the Money,5,"I bought my car used several months ago with 110,000 miles. So far, I am very impressed with my car given that it is 16 years old. The seats in the car are extremely comfortable. The car rides smooth and handles well in the snow. There is generous interior space for passengers and more than enough trunk space. Not to mention, this car is a great value with plenty of features for the money. The SE trim comes standard with heated seats and an 8 speaker sound system. My car has been reliable with no major mechanical problems. Overall, I highly recommend the 2000 Volvo S70 as a used car. I hope to keep this car as long as possible.

Then I found this gem- a 1999 Volvo S70 T5, mother of god..this thing goes. I mean IT GOES. I am completely blown away about how fast this car goes. No one expects it. It's also very luxurious (very nice leather seating, wonderful sound system, heated seats)"
volvo,s70,2000,coldax, 04/21/2009,Great used car value,4,"Purchased 3/08 w/122K miles. Now 4/09 and 150K and no major repairs. Previous owner took good care of it, so if you shop for one make sure it was maintained. Mine has non-turbo engine, delivering 28mpg and less maint. issues. Seats are outstanding. Feels very safe inside. Nice blend of luxury and sporty looks. Car does not look 9 years old at all. Huge trunk and fold flat seats. My SE has leather, wood trim, 8 speaker stereo that sounds fantastic, heated mirrors, etc. I added a K&N drop-in air filter ($40-helps with mileage and acceleration), also added strut bar to help w/body roll in corners ($50 on ebay). I recommend for safety, comfort, looks & value: cost $35K new, mine was $3200!"
volvo,s70,2000,Paradise Boy, 03/27/2010,I just love my Volvos,4,"I had ordered this 2000 VolvoS70 SE ASR in 1999 and picked it up from the dealer in December 1999.  Right from the start my wife and I had loved everything about it the comfort, drive, style and reliability that comes with a volvo.  Now 10 years old and still going strong.  I have had to do some maintenance nothing major.  We loved it so much that and with the addition of children, in November 2008 we had purchased the 2009 Volvo XC90 to the driveway.  The volvo S70 got us hooked on volvos and we never even looked at any other make.  We love our two Volvos."
volvo,s70,2000,volvolover, 04/12/2017,Still rocking at 216k!,5,"I don't believe in buying new cars, so I bought this baby used in 2007.  Since many of the reviews here are several years old, I thought I'd offer my two cents for anyone who is considering buying one of these OBGs (oldies but goodies).  This v70 SE had about 85k miles on it when I purchased it.  Today (10 years later), it has 216k.  I love, love, love this car!  If you can find one in decent condition, buy it!!  It has been a wonderful vehicle.  Very reliable, safe, comfortable.  Plenty of room in both the front and back seats, and generous trunk space.  (It may not seem like enough to you if you're used to a wagon or SUV, but it is a great-sized trunk for a sedan.)  Have taken several looong roadtrips (3k+ mi.) with this car, and can say that it's been fabulous!  Smooth, great acceleration whenever needed/wanted, and after 8-10 hours in the car during a long leg of the trip, you can emerge unscathed.  Super comfortable seating.  Even after 17 years, I average 25.5 mpg, comprised mostly of in-town driving and some highway.  Great steering, suspension.  The idea of having to part with it at some point down the road makes me sad.  I spend approx. $1k/year on repairs and maintenance (normal service, tires, repairs, everything).  That amount would make me bleed from the eyes if the car was new, but this vehicle is mature, and some amount of replacement must be expected.  When I divide that number by 12, I still know that I'm doing much better than flushing a ton of money down the toilet on a new car!

It's good on gas, comfortable and fun to drive, and it's fast. I love to hear the turbo kick in. If I buy another car guess what... Volvo.  "

The dealership said come back in and we will turn it off for you. No problems passed 125 point inspection--mint condition. I have taken that car for service and one recall after the other and it's even shut down on the highway once.  I have had a service bill of $1600, on several occasions and nothing under $700 for the 7 times its needed service in the last 5 years. I love my car and it is pretty to look at but it is a lemon. I just cannot afford the service anymore...which seems to happen every year without fail right around inspection time because that check engine light is on. "
volvo,s70,2000,Ivan Lucas , 12/06/2006,2000 GLT Keep It-Or You Will Miss It!!,5,"I ""tried"" to incorporate a ""9"" in my ratings of perfect ""10s"" (to make it more realistic for non-believers). But there was not 1 particular category that I felt I should slight in any way.  If anything the performance category it should be an 11, And the comfort a 12! If you own 1 of these cars (especially a Turbo) DO NOT SELL IT to purchase something ""More expensive""(like I did). You will find there is NOTHING on the market (regardless how much you will spend) that compares to the comfort and performance this car delivers. The seats feel tailor-made. 0-60 and 1/4 mile times are also in V-8 territory. Dont believe me? -drive one. And as for gas mileage - the turbos RUN ON AIR! I get 28mpg."
volvo,s70,2000,Turbomolar, 01/16/2005,Bring back the S70 body style!!!,4,"Most people don't realize how easy it is to customize their Volvos.  With a simple ECU change, intake and exhaust upgrade, your S70 GLT SE can easily add another 40hp and 70torque.  And upgrading to a lighter 17"" aftermarket rims(I recommend the 17.5 lb. SSR-GT1 wheel.) with wider tires transforms this boxy grandpa car into a sexy, agressive, turbobrick! ;)  I love my S70.  Too bad Volvo stopped making this body style.  Guess I'll have to get a XC70 next. Anyways...no real problems have arisen in the past 5 years(except for the turn signal recall that was easily fixed).  Let's all email Volvo and tell them to bring the S70 body style back!"
volvo,s70,2000,techie, 06/21/2007,"Odd, but comfortable",4,"We bought this car for the safety and the incredibly comfortable seats, but we wouldn't buy another one. It has odd quirks, like the junky cupholders in the front and the lack of any trunk light, that are annoying for a car at this price level. The dangerous trouble with the jerky electronic throttle (ETS) really scared us, especially when we got the bill for the repair. Fortunately, Volvo did the right thing and reimbursed us for the repair and, at least at first, warrantied it for life. However the class action suit for this problem seems to indicate a shorter warranty. It's now a recall, so get it fixed before it stops working altogether."
volvo,s70,2000,Jeff Barnes, 08/24/2006,Last Volvo,3,"This has been the most expensive car I've ever had to own. I wouldn't say it's very reliable either Warranty service was fair at best. I dread the check engine light going on. That's never less than a $1,000. I like the way the car looks and drives but I can't afford it or can I rely on it. "
volvo,s70,2000,Reuven Alayev, 08/01/2008,The best choice of my life,5,"i bought the Volvo S70 about back in 2002. The Volvo had a great cherry red exterior and a light tan colored interior. I was amazed that the car looked like new after driving 154,000 miles in six years. That made me worried, but I asked many mechanics and they all told me that Volvos don't give any problems, just refill the gas, change the oil every 2000 miles, and refill the water, and the car will be loyal to you. They were so right! My Volvo S70 now has over 174,000 miles and still drives and looks brand new, and it has not given me any mechanical problems ever since I bought it almost 2 years ago. This is a great car that keeps its value over time.  "
volvo,s70,2000,William Wellman, 10/31/2008,"""Like a Rock""",4,"My lawyer daughter talked me into my first Volvo for safety resons and I'm glad she did but for other reasons! Non-turbo has plenty of power for all highway situations. Gas economy is 23MPG. I'm happy with this at 150,000 on the odometer. Will go to 250 with this ""baby"". Very reliable in severe weather, especially snow. Would highly recomend as a used car buy!"
volvo,s70,2000,Merle, 03/03/2002,Excellent Vehicle,4,"We have been extremely satisfied with our Volvo.  It has always performed up to standard for us.  The controls are in good positions despite what the ""Cons"" for this car state.  Required intervals are 7500 mi and it has not given us any major problems.  The car is completely loaded with all that Volvo had to offer.  Smooth yet responsive ride.  Volvo has been nothing more than a pleasure to deal with.  The AWD is excellent in the snow as are the Anti-lock brakes."
volvo,s70,2000,Pugsleypie, 03/02/2005,Sure and Steady,4,"I have owned my S70 for 5 years.  Its been very reliable, great gas mileage, and very comfortable seats. However, it has severe blind spots making it tough to change lanes.  And forget the outside rearview mirrors - no help with the blind spots.  The base engine has more than enough power and runs on mid- grade gas.  Cloth seats are difficult to keep clean.  This is a great car, but watch those blind spots."
volvo,s70,2000,n2b, 04/24/2006,Low Reliability,3,"Good Sturdy car, Safe, However it is difficullt to maintain. While changing oil and filters -- it needs special internal filter and needs special wrench. It forces you to go to a dealer for oil changes. No dip stick for checking transmission fluid. Ease of maintenance always increases a car's reliabilty. Engine hot light comes on occasionally while the temp gauge reads normal and with full antifreeze. The light goes off only after an overnight cooling. The electronic throttle light comes on and the engine stalls. Volvo has not been able to explain the problem. The dealer will clean the throttle butterfly but it might or might not fix the problem. Volvo refuses to issue a recall."
volvo,s70,2000,Larry, 07/26/2006,Volvo S70,4,"Great car except for the major problem that Ford inherited with the emission system's Electronic Throttle Assembly.  Fortunately, Class Action lawsuit allows owners to have it fixed for free up to 200,000 miles saving you $1,000.  Kudos to Ford/Volvo for doing the right thing! Handles well and is great for long drives. Front end rides rough over bumps but maybe because I'm used to SUV tires.  "

overall I love the car -- but I have 
had problems. The blinkers took 5 trips 
to the dealer to get fixed, then I gave 
up. Also, bulbs burn out on this car 
every day it seems. Goes through 
headlight bulbs every couple of months. 
Also, I had to replace the fan in the 
air conditioning. Also the check engine 
light was coming on, and the dealer 
told me that hardly ever happens - it 
was a $900. repair and the car was out 
of warrantee by 5,000 miles. Thank 
goodness the dealer ended up fixing it 
for free. What a blessing.

have a love-hate relationship! "
volvo,s70,2000,Trader1997, 07/08/2003,Not as good since Ford influence,4,"The quality not as good as the 95 850 I

looser, pickup not as steady or quick, 
handling not up to 95 standards. Have

minor such as the ever present 
taillights going out. If I buy another,

Our volvo is sturdy around corners and handles like a dream minus when you hit a bump. I am used to having an suv and miss having the room in the back for my work supplies, but I had to park my Escalade due to crazy gas prices. That baby gets 17mpg. I ge 23mpg in town and would like to see if I can get alittle better gas mileage out of it.  If anyone has any ideas send me and e-mail. "

Ive saved tons of money working on it myself. I do my own oil changes. Did the brakes and rotors. Changed the timing belt. Now at 155,000 miles, it runs and shifts smoothly. The original paint looks better than cars only a few years old! Also bought a 2005 S60 2.5T with 136,000 miles on it  for only $2000. Not a scratch or ding on it. Will change timing belt myself. I expect both cars to go for 300,000 miles +. They are both a pleasure to drive. I was looking at a 2005 Toyota Corolla for $1800 with crank windows and no AC. I did better with the S70.

I have been taking care of it, and it has been taking car of me. Disregarding preventative maintenance, the only parts I have had to change were the oxygen sensors (which were supposed to be changed at 100000 miles) and the battery.  Many people complain that the repairs are expensive, which may be true for someone who for someone who feels bound to the dealer for all repairs. However if you are willing shop around for labor and parts, you can make the repair and maintenance experience comparable to other cars."
volvo,s80,2000,Mel, 08/09/2006,The Best Car I've Ever Owned,5,"I'm 53 years old and have owned a lot of cars, but none beats the 2000 Volvo S80 Turbo.  I have no idea what the other people are talking about, but I've had nothing but excellent reliability and pure driving pleasure.  I've owned the car for almost two years and drive it everyday. I get 21 mpg city and 25 highway. Short or long distance driving experience is nothing short of superb. The turbo is awesome, but I also own a 2000 Volvo S80 nonturbo, which is just as great (owned for 6 years and NO bad experience, just routine maintenance). I love my 2000 S80s.  I will purchase the 2007 S80, but I won't trade in my 2000 S80s.  I'm keeping them. "
volvo,s80,2000,ampxs, 02/05/2013,Not for the long run,3,"I bought this car is 2010 with 160k miles on it. I bought it AS-IS and they gave me a new battery since the one it had was dead. I got a great deal on it considering the milage. I had no issues with it for about the first year, after that the ac went out I have replaced the radiator myself for $90. I have replaced 2 ignition coils which I did myself ($80 a piece). I found out from the volvo dealer I needed a new ETM which is 1200 installed. I run the car without it being replaced and it surges. I changed both the axels which was difficult. I do oil changes every 6k miles. It has 220k miles now and needs a timing belt but it is 800 to replace. Its a good car if you dont mind putting lots of $"
volvo,s80,2000,Shelline Holmes, 10/31/2010,Terrible reliability,3,I thought the Volvo was a reliable vehicle. But I should have done more research. The Volvo which I brought had 55000 miles. Today it has 69000. The transmission has to be replaced. The brakes have to be replaced again. The check engine light is on and off. The sensor system is bad. The control arms have to be replaced. The repair bill is just unbelievable!!!! I have to let the car go.  
volvo,s80,2000,Coolmo, 04/19/2010,2000 Volvo s80 Dr T-6,3,This car is the worst car I've ever own. I saw the mix reviews about this car and was hoping maybe I would get one that was reliable. It turns out I shouldn't make my life career gambling. I bought this car with 80k on it. First it was the motor mounts then it was th shocks and rattle noise. then the check engine light. The the SRS light. Then it would stall once in a while. usually when i try to merge unto the highway. Now i am told the cars computer is not working correctly. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER VOLVO. do yourself a favor and take heed to this review(unlike me) stay away from volvo do not buy. especially this model.
volvo,s80,2000,REBARLEE, 02/08/2010,2000 S80 T6,3,Purchased new - all available options- first few years ok- This is my 6th and last ever Volvo. Dealers now charge $100 for diagnostics. Fit and finish crappy-Check engine light on constantly even though we always had dealer maintain. Now transmission shot- strut too many times to mentions- Throttle body always an issue. Electronics are a joke- expensive and unreliable- Do your self a favor and do not buy any post 1987 Volvo- Since Ford took over went from being a great to a crappy car
volvo,s80,2000,sedan man, 02/26/2002,Affordable Luxury Sedan,4,"This is solid, well built safe sedan.  The acceleration is strong and a great ride on the highway if you're going north and south.  The handling is okay.  Semi-frustrating trunk lock/unlock feature.  The interior features are great, comfortable seats, lots of leg room for taller people.  Haven't had any problems with the car after 12K miles.  Aside from the lock/unlock features all in all, for the money, a very good buy."
volvo,s80,2000,Ju-Ju '50, 05/25/2010,She is fast and fun! I love Volvo!,4,"The previous owner took excellent care of her.  She hardly looked sat in, much less driven.  I couldn't believe my luck, to total my Volvo sw and find a beaut waiting for me to buy her.  It's amazing to put my foot on the accelerator and find out I'm going 93 and it feels like I'm going 35!  She feels like an affordable luxury car.  Leather seating, air conditioning ducts behind the rear seats, front seat warmers, wiper blades on the headlights, a button for wet weather control.  The ride is quiet, cruise control makes the drive effortless, smooth.  She was used after all; the locks needed replacing, and the transmission because I forgot to shift out of low while driving on the freeway."
volvo,s80,2000,josh smith, 06/28/2010,"200,000 mile car feels like new",4,I recently bought my 2000 Volvo s80 t6 it had crazy mileage so i paid 2k for it body was in great shape motor is so quiet you cannot even tell its running. handles great! with more power than my A4 or A6. interior design looks great has a small issue with the seat belt buckle catching and tearing the leather on the door skin easy fix with one of those v seat belt support things. it does lack in the turning radius but it still handles better than any American car. a slight mod to the air box and the car is fast. over all it has been the best 200k car i have seen ill re review this car at 400k I'm sure it will make it. as for costs with eBay and cl parts are no longer so expensive. 
volvo,s80,2000,Stephen, 09/30/2015,Very comfortable when it working,5,"It a money pit......love the car and drives very comfortable but I keep going to the car shop every month or so and breaking the bank......I hope this the last time until for a while
"
volvo,s80,2000,joesmith7, 09/16/2012,Failed Transmission,4,"Bought the car new in 2000, owned it for 12 years and put 126k miles on it. Car was running fine with no problems until about 112k when a pipe fitting on the radiator cracked and ruined the radiator. At 126k the transmission ripped itself apart. Got 3 separate transmissions put in and all 3 of them broke immediately. Either scraping the car or buying a new trans to put in, either way I've put a lot of money into it. And the gas mileage sucked, 14-15 city is unacceptable."
volvo,s80,2000,Robert, 01/28/2009,"Great interior/drive, spotty reliability",4,"I bought this car in July of '08 with 74K miles on it and was given a 3 month warranty from the dealer. I noticed the transmission slipping noticeably almost immediately and took it in to the dealer, as I've read these cars have transmission problems. It was covered by the warranty and replaced for free. I've also had the front brake pads and rotors replaced and the cruise control works sporadically. The interior is stylish and extremely comfortable, and the drive is great. Plenty of power. I would tell anyone in the market for a 2000 and later S80 to be careful when looking. Make sure the car is in good shape. If it's been treated well, there shouldn't be too many problems. "
volvo,s80,2000,Bowman, 05/07/2008,The Worst Car Ever!,2,"We bought the 2000 model after threatening our dealer with a lemon law suit for the 1999 model we purchased 60 days prior.  Dealer took the car back at full refund and offered us the 2000 model for a ""deal"".  I wish they would have just kicked us in the head.  Two ABS modules, engine struts, 3 radios, 3+ software upgrades, bi-annual computer resets (the kind that required a shuttle to and from work), two extended warranties (paid for themselves in six months), suspension problems.  I would estimate the maintenance cost for this car have exceeded $20k.  If it was a plane or a boat we would be dead. I thought Volvo Corp. could be trusted to release a product complete."
volvo,s80,2000,Tlover, 08/17/2009,I think I like this car???,4,"Ok, so after being in a bad accident I found this car and LOVED how it drove.  This car did leave me stranded on a roadtrip, which was the result of a blown transmission....that cost a fortune!  Other than the tranny disaster, I must say the car has actually been a pretty great car.  It rides very smooth and is freakin fast!  I have smoked many Bimmers and Audi's in this.  Tiptronic is alot of fun.  Front end assembly seems to have alot of problems too.  Overall I think I still do like this car.  Currently has 95k miles"
volvo,s80,2000,JDavis, 11/24/2009,Saddened by Volvo,3,"This has been a disappointment since the day we bought it. We have currently spent more on repairs than we did on the car and are planning another trip back this weekend. I am looking at trading it in, but trying to find out if there is a dealer who would take this mess. My advice would be to investigate any Volvo you plan to purchase and avoid the 2000 S80 like the plague it is."
volvo,s80,2000,mecop186, 12/23/2009,Air Bags,3,"Two weeks ago we had a snow storm here in Maine (go figure). Well I got stuck in a driveway. Couldn't get out to save my life! After trying for 40 minutes, I was so pi**ed off, I put my S80 T6 in ""Park"", got out and slammed the drivers door. I heard a ""POoof"" sound and, when I turned around, it truly looked like I had installed venetian blinds! The ""Side Curtains"" went off! Ripped the stitching out of the left ""Lumbar"" support, split the leather, left a 7"" tear in the headliner and I now have foam EVERYWHERE the eye can see! Estimates range from $2,000 to $6,000. I'll be taking it to the mid-range guys. They were very intrigued about the door slamming setting off the air bags. "
volvo,s80,2000,S80T6, 01/13/2010,Don't buy,3,Fast and good gas mileage.  Absolutely terrible reliability.  Many expensive suspension problems.  Power window motors fail commonly and are expensive to repair.  Averaging over $1200/year in repair costs plus normal maintenance.  A real lemon
volvo,s80,2000,rosarockville, 03/24/2010,quality of plastic parts is very poor,3,"Agreed with other review that after 5 yrs the parts started falling apart. The repair labor charge is awfully high. Even one $50 plastic parts would need 6 to 8 hours labor to replace it. The dealer claimed that those parts are very difficult to reach. I like my volvo car but the repairing charges definitively will make me re-consider for having Volvo for my next car. Now, every time, I can not have my car back from the shop without paying $1300 - $2300. They just told me the oil trap needs to be replaced which got replaced 2 yrs ago, and it costs a little more than $1000."
volvo,s80,2000,msC, 05/16/2010,Has the worst interior!,3,"I agree with previous reviews about the maintenance, every time I took it for maintenance was $300 or more.  The leather has cracked and the door and window panels has totally come apart. Had window tint done at dealership it literally shrunk, they guaranteed it but when went to dealer, states they don't used that company any more and I need to find someone to replace it. "
volvo,s80,2000,Ian, 07/10/2010,Not so Reliable after all,3,"I had always heard Volvo's were reliable Safe cars and I came across one and decided to buy it because it was a good value for that price. It's really the most luxurious vehicle you can get for the price. There were many issues from the start for me. First the interior started to fall apart and that wasn't any fun because the prices for parts are ridiculous. Eventually my entire motor blew because Volvo decided that A plastic radiator hose was appropriate for a $55,000 vehicle and it broke off and blew the entire engine. Basically It is a very nice, fun, comfortable car to drive, but it is not worth it for the horrible reliability and price of parts that comes with the ownership of this car."
volvo,s80,2000,RGrabber, 11/14/2002,2000 S80 Wont buy another,3,"This car is expensive to maintain which 
I anticipated upon purchase.  what I 
didn't anticipate was the amount of 
maintinance.  The electrical system is 
forever causing problems, I estiamte 
that I have had 6 bulbs replaced by the 
dealer and I have replace fuses at 
least 15 times.
The stabilizer (at least that's what 
the dealer called them) seem to need 
replacement every 20,000 miles my next 
replacement (needed now) is outside the 
warranty.

It may look better than previous Volvos
but it isn't built better. I'll not 
replace this one with another Volvo."
volvo,s80,2000,FirstS80T6, 11/24/2002,"Some flaws, and not again",4,"I have several complaints about this 
car.  First of all, the 17-inch 
upgraded tires are not suitable for 
any winter driving in the Northeast.  
I learned this the hard way.  Second, 
driving with the windows and sunroof 
open will cause the rear view mirror 
to shake very violently at 60mph.  
Third, maintenance and autobody works 
are extremely expensive.  It costs me 
over $700 to replace a cracked 
headlight!  Routine maintenance 
services were over $200 each visit.  
Fourth, the suspension and the 
steering are too soft for my liking.  
Last, the visibility is very poor.  
For the amount of money, it is not 
worth it, and I will definitely not 
buy the S80 again."
volvo,s80,2000,DaveF, 12/11/2002,Overall good ownership experience,3,"Generally a pleasure to own (lease) and 
drive.  Dependable all-weather vehicle. 
Love the twin turbos, combined w/ an 
excellent manual gear selection mode.  
Exterior styling, as well as the 
quality of paint/trim, is excellent.  
Interior fit/finish is just o.k.  
Disappointed by fake wood molding & 
squeeky interior panels."
volvo,s80,2000,anosmic, 01/28/2003,Money-sucking disaster,3,"Only a repair shop could bear to own 
this vehicle, and then only if they had 
infinite access to free replacement 
parts. I haven't had the personal 
resolve to total up the repair bills we 
have had on this car, conservatively 
$15000 in less than 4 years.  The 
design crew Volvo hired for this car 
were definitely in way over their 
heads, unless they are getting a cut on 
the repair bills from the Volvo shops."
volvo,s80,2000,Jose, 10/10/2005,Good Car to Drive,4,"I purchased my first Volvo 280 as a certified pre-owned in September 2003. I had a few small gliches at the beggining of my ownership which have been fixed by the dealer at no cost, namely problems had to do with rough idle, and system required maintenance. For the last year the car has performed excellently with just normal maintenance performed"
volvo,s80,2000,Jim, 09/16/2006,Volvo wears out,2,"I bought mine used at 28,000 and have put only 14,000 on each of the last two years.  At 56,000 miles the transmission went and the quote from Volvo was $3,500 to fix.  since it was just past the 50,000 mile warranty Volvo offered no assistance and they lowballed the value of the trade-in, even though I was offering to buy a 2006 S80. Based on the unreliability of the car and the atitude of Volvo this was the first and only Volvo my family will be owning."
volvo,s80,2000,tsdero, 09/29/2006,Safety Factor,4,"I have been rear ended twice now in this car, once with 400 miles and just recently.  Both times the other driver's airbags went off and I was fine.  The car absorbed all of the impact.  In fact, this second time, my purse didn't even come off the front seat.  The officers said that it would have been any other car, the trunk would have been in my rear seat.  I'll buy another just for the saftey factor."
volvo,s80,2000,r_brian, 12/06/2012,"Scrap at 75,000 miles",3,"Front a arms replaced, timing belt, and now the fly wheel became toothless. Two thousand to fix this item and the value of these cars is gone."
volvo,s80,2000,Sportscarnut, 04/23/2005,Great Car To Drive To the Shop,2,"In a period of 18 months the following failed: ignition switch, oxygen sensor, mass flow meter, motor mount, upper strut mount, headlight assembly, brake rotors, ABS control unit, turn signal assembly, turbo oil return line, front strut assemblies (2), door trim piece, turbo oil seals, etc.  It also had a nasty habit of throwing black brake dust from the front rotors down the side of the car.  The really bad part is that if it had been even somewhat realiable, this would be an unbelieveable car.  It is nice to look at, very comfortable, relatively easy to work on, and it is very cheap on the used market (probably due to the horrible reliability)."

My experience so far has been good,friends like it, runs and drives great. It seems these cars are bashed regularly here and I would like to speculate why this happens. Every car company,Honda and Toyota included,has good and bad examples. Your car can not treat you any better than you treat it. Also,not all dealership technicians are equally talented. If your local Volvo dealer can not fix your car to your satisfaction,find a good independent shop. If you drive your car very aggressively,ie hard braking and jack rabbit starts, expect extra repairs. Don't always blame the car for owner/driver shortcomings. "

Love the look and drive of this car, have had all maintenance performed on time at the dealership. This dealership's service dept. is ranked #1 in the country, now i know why, you see the folks there so much they get to be family.  Have spent over $7,000 on repairs since I have owned the car, expensive replacements like the srs control unit, the abs control unit, the fire box (?), not to mention the usual wear and tear items.  A car of this supposed quality that has been maintained exactly as recommended with the number of miles i have put on it should not have these types of problems - never again Volvo."

is working properly.  I have had 
several problems w/ the suspension and 
struts and it has been a pain to fix 
since I purchased the vehicle in Baton 
Rouge and I live in New Orleans.  The 
local dealership puts you at the end of 
the line to get anything repaired since 
the vehicle was not purchased there.  
This vehicle is overpriced and I would 
not recommend buying a new Volvo."

After several repairs of one kind or another, she started hesitating. Trusted mechanic said it was throttle body covered by extended warranty so take it to them for free replacement. Local dealer charged $100 for diagnostic and said it needed $3000 head gasket. Not so local dealer charged $100 for diagnostic and said it needed a $2300 head gasket.

Well, the dealer that gave the car a clean bill of health 4 mo. ago, now says it is going to take $7,000 to fix. Are you kidding me?

Volvo are very pricey cars for them to be so unreliable. I had to replace so many things and i've always maintained it so well and always dealer maintained. but i'm done with this company
volvo,s80,2000,IanRomines, 09/11/2009,Great car for your money!!!,4,I guess with all cars you get bad ones and good ones. Mine was a good one I cant believe I can drive a luxury Vehicle for less than $8000. I have never sat in a seat so comfortable in this Volvo. You have so much power it feels like you can do anything. It surprises me that cars were this stylish in the mid 2000s its like nothing else on the road. I love my Volvo and will keep it for a very long time.
volvo,s80,2000,The Big Guy, 06/12/2002,Poor Man's Luxury Import Sedan,4,"First import in our garage. Great to

thought the 30K check was a bit 
pricey...  Not many improvements to

diagnosis.  On the replacement,the 
sight lines are so bad that these are 
dangerous; there is not a blind ""spot,"" 
there is a right blind side.  
Transmission doesn't always shift 
properly; it sometimes reverses when it 
says ""drive,"" parks when it 
says ""reverse,"" etc.  And the car 
shakes when one goes from 0 to 5 on a 
dry surface!  (Like pulling out of a

My biggest complaint with the vehicle 
is the far to rapid depreciation

not support the market and openly admit 
that there is limited demand for used

drill, and the car rattles like an 80's 
American car. I live with it all, but 
for $35K I expected a lot more! Since

It's the most comfortable car I've owned, and drives and handles like a dream.  I know there have been problems so I purchased the extended warranty as I plan to keep the car for at least seven years.

Now have 100 and have to sell because it is costing me $1000 per quarter for repairs. The mechanic said that the items needing to be fixed are not common problems. Great. I can't wait until the common problems occur. I hate the idea of selling but my comfortable car is no longer dependable. If dependability could be improved, I would buy another one. i.e. wheel hub $700, throttle $1200 a/c next last 4 months in repair. Sorry Volvo."

ask him about his.  He remembers one 
 repair under warranty but believes it 
might have just been a recall.  
Overall, he said the reliability has

volvo,s80,2000,MDB51, 02/05/2006,What has happened to Volvo Quality,3,"This was my second Volvo. My first was a 1994 that was great. I looked foreward to the 2000 S-80. Intially it was fine, I do put a lot of miles on my cars but I also religiously keep them serviced too. It seemed that after the warrently was up everthing seemed to go bad. My biggest problem was first my right front wheel assembly collapsed to the tune of about $3000. Then a year later the left side collapsed-the same amount. I heard there was a factory recall on U joints and I suspect that I was not the only one to have this problem. The front under trim kept falling off. I finally got rid of it for a Mercedes which still has quality in their cars."
volvo,s80,2000,Gator104, 03/10/2006,Looks Good - Did't Last,3,"We bought this used with 39,000 miles.  It has low profile tires which was a mistake as the noise from them is almost unbearable.  Had the front suspension replaced at 87,000 (ride still noisy even after that).  Had the sunfoof guides replaced due to roof rattle. Also, light bulbs burned out on a routine basis - a big pain. Little trim items kept breaking that had to be replaced - also a pain.  THe radio/CD was of poor quality with poor sound and reception. Don't know if the lack of quality was the fault of Volvo or Ford cheapening things once they took over.  Resale value does not hold at all.  Finally dumped this dog at 89,000 miles and bought a used Lexus RX300, which is wonderful."

safest and most stylish cars on the

my previous car - petite lil' Toyota 
Corolla) takes some getting used to,

opinion for repairs:  

Air cond. control unit failure
Antilock brake system unit failure
STS (traction control) unit failure
Exhaust system - faulure
Intermittent light failure 
Transmission control unit -- failure

When the STS and ABS control units 
fail, they cause the transmission 
control unit to fail.

Spoke with other S80 customers who had 
similar experiences.  1999-2002 models 
are known for having faulty / poorly 
design electrical systems.

less than 30 days, purchased used, 
taken in for repair at least 5 times; 
for light bulb outage, faulty alarm, 
gas tank door; CV joints, bolts on

but the 2000 S80 has many electric and 
front end problems, in addition to 
console and sun roof rattling, also 
Poor AM reception, but overall sound

another Volvo but not without a warranty"
volvo,s80,2000,pmerch, 02/26/2008,Awesome car with a few trips for repairs,4,This car is very powerful and performs excellent.  I purchased this used a few years ago with 85k miles. The issue has been the repairs such as suspension and the throttle body but that was covered from a recall. I must say it's a comfortable car and looks great but it makes me nervous that a very costly repair is about to happen in the near future.  Replacing the timing belt was not too expensive though and I recommend going to an independent shop unless you like to pay double the price and that can add up since this car goes in the shop every three months!
volvo,s80,2000,Movie Star, 03/13/2003,"A reliable, safe, & comforable ride",5,"Experience has been excellent to
superior with very few problems of any
kind. The car has superior safety
features, is a comfortable ride and
extremely reliable over 30,000 miles to
date. It averages 2o miles in the city
and 27 on the highway. The sound systym
is excellent and as are the handling
characteristics. No realignment has been
necessary, the tire wear factor has been
excellent with an est. additinal 10k
miles to go. Brake lining wear to match."

I bought my Volvo S80 at a used car dealership, where I noticed that the warning light for the airbag was on. The dealer said the Volvo mechanics could reset that sensor - apparently not! Turns out that Volvo put the airbag SENSOR under the driver's seat carpet. The used car dealer STEAMED that carpet, thus ruining a $1000 sensor. My car's now in the shop for the second time in three months. Volvo engineers ought to be taken out and shot for what they've done to this car!"
volvo,s80,2000,Lisa Lewis, 03/13/2003,Never again,3,"It's a shame that a top notch mfrg. 
like Volvo would let the engine quality 
slip to non existent.Yes, it's safe and 
comfortable, but high maintenance--
unbelieveable. In one year, I spent 
over $4k in tires (only 2 types fit the 
rims) and constant repairs i.e. every 
10k youhave to clean the electronic 
throttle (I did twice in a yr) or it 
will surge. Never again!"
volvo,s80,2000,Arthur, 03/07/2005,Great Car,4,"Lots of complainers on here, but so far no major problems with my purchase. One instance of fuse blowing on Driver Motorized Seat, but easily fixed.

Great sound system. True luxury feel with excellent safety features and handling."

During that time, the following failed or broke: upper strut mounts (2), oxygen sensor, mass flow sensor, motor mount, lower control arm, strut assembly, front brake rotors, ABS control unit, turbo oil return line, dashboard clock, ignition switch, turn signal switch, headlight assembly, exterior trim piece, door trim piece, etc., etc.  Additionally, when I sold it, one of the turbos was blowing oil and the transmission shifts had gotten mushy (neither of which the dealership was willing to correct).  Other than that, it was the best car you could ever own.  It was fast, handled great, and was very comfortable.  It also got about 20 mpg."

My car is in the shop every 3-4 months for things other than regular maitenance.  This car has had two recalls on it since I have owned it.  I had to replace the ECU and the power steering rank.  Luckily I had the VIP select warranty.  I have prolems with the engine stalling while I was in freeway traffice along with my daughter in the car, I have had to have the radiator replaced, amongst other things.  I have owned this car for a year and half and it's been in the shop so much that I just should have stuck with a Honda Accord.  "

The ride is excellent, the interior is extremely comfortable, and it looks grrrreat!  I have had the throttle control valve replaced for about $1,000, after dumping $600 on same problem and cleaning of the injectors.  You will know when the throttle control valve gets dirty when the idle RPMs go up and down and the computer automatically shuts off the cruise while going down the highway because the RPMs are not steady enough.  If yours gets dirty DO NOT bother having it cleaned once to avoid the cost of replacement.  Replacement can be delayed but not avoided.  Just get it replaced and save some $$."
volvo,s80,2000,KCKid, 05/25/2005,Volvo must go,3,"Great car if you can afford to keep it in repairs.  Dealership must live off of the income from service dept. Transmission replaced at 80,000. Various other expensive problems."
volvo,s80,2000,Jimmy, 09/29/2005,Should be as reliable as Volvo used to be,4,"I purchased this car with 54k on it, mostly for volvo reputation of durability and reliability (not any more). I have to change the power steering rack ($900) Cooling fan (before they make a recall). Every visit to volvo dealer is like going to HELL, they charge you for the aire you breath. Every thing typically cost you 10 times compared to the same issue in an american or Japanese car. I am already looking for either Honda or Toyota."
volvo,s80,2000,Robert, 12/04/2005,Luxury at a bargain price,4,"I fell in love with the styling of this car the first year it was introduced--not the brick that Volvo enthusiasts admire. This is the most exciting automoabile I ever owned. But it's not just the looks that make it so great. It is a teriffic touring car, with a combination of smooth acceleration with power to get you into or out of the flow of traffic at will, and the comfort to drive for hours without fatigue. Navigation system is first rate. Backup radar has paid for itself several times, preventing rear end damage backing up in tight quarters. It's been a very reliable car, the only issues being cooling fan and battery replaced under warranty. Despite the power, highway mpg is 27."

It's a total lemon.  Don't buy one! "
volvo,s80,2000,murfslaw, 09/16/2006,Didn't know how bad,3,This car has been a maintanence nightmare. A lot of warranty repairs to suspension and drive train. 12K mile interval between brake jobs. My cost of maintainence has been $187/month since I bought the car...not including gas.
volvo,s80,2000,Joe Balasicka, 10/05/2006,Very Costly Driving Pleasure,3,"I love everything about this car except it is as reliable as a newspaper in a hailstorm. It only has 50k and the following already has had to be repaired: front struts, bearings and plates, ABS module, oxygen sensor, front bushings, motor mount,has oil leak that mechanic said to wait until I see oil on ground, engine light currently on?, just recommended tie rods to be replaced by mechanic-can wait on that.

volvo,s80,2000,ex volvo owner, 11/11/2006,worst vehicle ever,2,"Got to be the worst car ever made take heed of all these poor reviews they're not making this stuff up, Suspension, electrical, AC the list goes on. Seat leather worn through, constant software problems or so the dealer says. The user who said 187/mo maintenance isn't exaggerating. We've got extended warranty and still shell out a thousand a year. One positive note, I've decided to buy a jaguar knowing it couldn't be any worse and I won't mind putting money into a car that has a bit of class. If you need a reliable car get a Camry."
volvo,s80,2000,SadCarOwner, 11/14/2006,Avoid this car at all costs,3,"Bought this car in 5/05.  So far:  - Sunroof broke - SRS system broke (three different sensors needed replacement) - AC System broke - Oil Leak (Trap/Seals/Pan) - Engine Light constantly  So far, about 5K in repairs for this car.  Edmunds just told me that the car is worth between 6K and 8K depending on who I sell it to.  These cars are pieces of junk, don't retain value, and is worth more to me if I drive it off a cliff."
volvo,s80,2000,lemonvolvo, 01/17/2007,Never again...,3,"Bought 4 years old with 27k on it. 55k miles now. Know why the low miles, spent most of its life in for repairs. I spent $1200 on new shift solenoid per Volvo, which didn't fix 2nd to 3rd gear shudder. Then told me only remedy is $3500 new tranny. Didn't do that yet. Numerous phantom electrical problems. Repeated trips to clear codes, with a minimum $50 charge each time. If you are thinking of buying this model year, run away as fast as you can. See message boards and reviews. Ford didn't even own Volvo yet, so can't lay blame there. But it is a GM tranny, go figure. Will never buy another Volvo, have owned 17 vehicles in 35 years, this is worst buy far, more problems than all others combined"

volvo,s80,2000,Jay, 03/19/2007,Reliable Fun,4,"I started out loving the car. Right after it went out of warranty I had a number of small issues. My dealer recommended that I contact the regional manager and I complained to him that all my miles were expressway and I was unhappy that these problems occurred. He authorized the dealership to take care of these and I was not charged. Thanks Volvo customer service! I have had very few problems since then and currently have 238,500 miles on the car. I have driven and would buy a new 2007 Volvo S80, but I do not like the new center console and the way my knee hits up against it is uncomfortable. As much time as I spend in the car comfort is important so I am now looking at a competitor's car. "
volvo,s80,2000,Sandra, 04/25/2007,My Volvo,4,I bought the car new. It is a wonderful car to drive although I have had a number of electrical and mechanical problems. I have severe arthritis and the seats are the most comfortable of any car I've ever owned and adjustable to many positions. I love the power and the instant response and feel it is the safest car on the road today. The only reason I'm considering another make is reliability.  I've never owned a car with so many problems. 
volvo,s80,2000,Brian, 05/30/2007,Worst Vehicle Every Purchased,2,"Probably in the top 5 worst cars every made. 7yr old car, with 89k mi. Here is the short list: Warning lights constantly going off. Engine constatnly surges, even after multiple trips to dealer, multi software downloads and new throttle installed. Transmission is slipping. ABS system failed. Already replaced front bushings, struts, strut mounts and bearings. After 2nd set of new rotors, still vibrates like crazy when stopping. Cloth interior drooping, seats cracking. Sunroof brackets coming off. Headlight assembly is bad. AC fan vibrates and makes noise. Incredible depreciation rate! Owe $6500 on car and will have to put $3 to $5k to fix tranmission. Volvo won't help! Warranty ended in '06. "
volvo,s80,2000,silver02m5, 09/24/2007,Reliability Nightmare,2,"Pretty much everything that can break on this car did break.  In a single 18 month period we replaced an oxygen sensor, a mass air flow sensor, a motor mount, both lower control arms (under recall), an ignition switch, an ABS control unit, two upper strut assemblies, a piece of door trim, the computer thumb wheel stalk, the dash display, and an oil return line.  The last straw was Volvo's refusal to replace a turbo that was blowing oil through the engine.  Also, the transmission was slipping at 50,000 miles.  A terribly made car from a company that has no interest in keeping long-term customers."
volvo,s80,2000,FirstVolvo LastVolvo, 05/17/2003,Great Power but Poor Reliability,4,"When Consumer Reports notes that this

road handling; but the fun stops there. 
I have spent so much time in the 
dealership with the front suspension, 
climate control, engine and 
transmission issues that it is on the 
rack more than the road. The vehicle 
reliability is incredibly disappointing

Got mine at 200k,drove it to 289k and that was with crappy maintanance due to me being a teen. Sometimes the car had no oil,i let it overheat a few times,and it never let me down. That 2.9 motor was indestructable. Was in multiple crashes and it made it through each one almost untouched. The end was when a Silverado going about 60mph ran a stop and rammed my Volvo. The volvo had frame damage and got dragged but i came out untouched. The silverados front end was smashed. And when i junked it,that thing STILL ran great. 2.9 engine was great to me,whereas my 99 S80 T6 didn't make it 1 week into my ownership without the turbos blowinh and the motor with it after.

The car absorbed the force incredibly. You can see from the damage how the design was made to absorb the forces and the head rests worked great in protecting the neck.   he and his brother who was also in the car were not hurt, no whiplash or anything.

volvo,s80,2001,Robert, 10/18/2015,Worst car I've ever owned!,1,"This car spent more time at the repair shop than on the road. I've never spent so much money in the course of 3 months trying to fix a car! This car was nothing but problems from 75,000 miles and up. Problems such as: faulty sensors,transmission problems, coolant hose, overheating, radiator, massive oil leaks and oil pressure problems, fuel pump and so on. I always dreamed of owning a volvo simply because they are great looking cars  and are safe as well, but after owning an s80 i think i wont be owning one ever again. These cars are extremely oil thirsty and constantly need brakes and rotors. I feel very disappointed with Volvo.  I feel so relieved now that i sold my volvo, I used to be scared to even drive the car because every time i would drive it i felt like it was going to leave me on the side of the road. Avoid Volvo at all costs! I've owned nissans all my life and every single one of them made it past the 200k mark without major probems, I'm exited to know that i will be going back with NISSAN.

It amazes me how smooth this car drives, even at 80 mph. I'm 26 and my friends (who are also in their twenties) copliment this car! 

As referenced by many others, this car has the GM transmission which does concern me, but it's still original at 250,000 miles, so I guess it can't be that bad!

Enough to catch you by surprise. 7500 miles intervals is not enough for a bi-turbo car.  How could Volvo suggest such long intervals??  Torque steer in this class is simply unheard of. But the S80 has it by the loads.  Don't buy this car.  Stereo is poor.  Cup holders are a joke.

My only complaints are that it could benefit from AWD and a 5 or 6 speed transmission. The manumatic transmission it has is still good and fun to use though. It has been well maintained and only accumulated an average of 9k miles per year. I previously owned a 98' S70 T5 and that car was enough for me to trust the reliability and quality that Volvo provides, the S70 has over 200k miles and still going!

I use synthetic oil and have it's services performed by a certified Volvo mechanic. Aside from common repairs (tie rods, tires, break pads), the most costly repair was an engine coil spring, which cost me $550. I purchased this car for three reasons; safety, comfort, and style.

I really wanted this to be a great car, but we had nothing but trouble with it.  When we bought it the dealer asked if we wanted the warranty and I said no because I know people who had over 300,000 miles on their Volvo's and had no trouble.  I should have bought the warranty.  We had it about 6 weeks when the ABS module went out.  That cost about $800 to fix.  A few months after that the car would just die when it was in gear.  We got stuck in a traffic jam in Dallas and everytime the car stopped it shut off.  I had to keep it in neutral and rev it to keep it from dying.  We took it back to the dealership after we got back home and it had a software glitch in the computer.  We have several little things that happened also but the final straw was when the transmission went out at 90,000 miles.  We finally just traded the car off.  It was a super comfortable car and it was great on trips when it worked well.  I'm 6'4"" and I had plenty of room in the car.   It had the potential of being a great car, but the repairs and the glitches just ruined it.  Be careful when looking at an early 2000's S80!

I'd heard that the maintenance was going to be extremely expensive. It is slightly more expensive but not that bad at all. It only gets about 18mpg though. Even when I'm at a long light or sitting in park with the car on for a long time, the engine runs very smoothly and extremely quietly. I expected the engine to be noisy because of the age of the car but it's one of the quietest engines I've ever heard. There is also very little road noise. Oh and a warning light is flashing warning me about a bulb failure, and from what I've read this happens pretty often."

I have bought 2 transmissions and had it in the shop for numerous electrical problems that they just can't fix. My dealer says they will no longer resell the s80 because they lose money on the warranty. I have owned volvos for almost 34 years and will never own one again. Volvo should do the right thing and warranty the transmission for 200,000 miles or more. Longevity, that was the volvo way. I expect to have to put a new transmission in it every year. Do yourself a favor. Don't take this vehicle, even if it is free. Much too unreliable. Two others I know that own one agree. A worthless dog of a car."
volvo,s80,2001,Dil, 12/13/2006,Too many expensive repairs,4,"I've owned this volvo since Oct. 06 and it's been trouble since then. Sway bar links, turbocharger drain o-ring, breaks/rotors, 60K maintenance, and all the recalls on it. I'm still waiting from the dealership about changing the Catalytic Converter, which is thankfully covered by under 80k warranty, otherwise it would've been $1,500 to replace it. It's a very nice car, and I've read some positive reviews on it, but I'd never expected to encounter these many problems from it. I hope there's no more trouble to see on this car because I've already spent $3,100 on it fixing the above plus problems. This volvo didn't meet my expectation of a volvo vehicle that i've heard about in the past."
volvo,s80,2001,denys1, 09/28/2011,I love it,4,"I bought this car for $7000 with 98000 miles and think it was a great deal for these money. It has about 18/25 mph, not too bad for 196hp engine. 
I used snow tires in winter and don't have any problem (I live in upstate NY and have enough snow). 
I had some problems with electronics, especial in winter. Throttle Body Control Module - was fixed, but THIS PART HAS 10 YEARS VOLVO's WARRANTY, I didn't spent any cent for repair that at volvo dealer. Actually, official dealership maintenance is little bit expensive, but I have near dealer which works only with Volvo cars long time. Same quality, but more cheap:). I spent about $1000 for three years, but I think it is normal for luxury car."
volvo,s80,2001,wayfire, 03/15/2002,rolling strength,5,"Picked up our S80 in Feb.  What a Valentines Day present!  Dealership was wonderful with everything.  Just had a six hour road trip with no compliants.  Plenty of trunk space.  Controls were easy to find and use, great nav. system.  You do have to read the manual to learn all offerings, but I drove it off the lot and could understand the basics.  Acceleration is fantastic, both off the line and at highway speeds.  Minimal noise from wind and road even considering Z-rated performance tires.  Everyone says beautiful car...it's a VOLVO?!  Safety is unmatched with any other car.  Great confidence when driving with wife and 5 month old daughter."
volvo,s80,2001,Nightmare, 06/08/2009,Nightmare,1,"I bought it used in '04 and have regretted it ever since.  I'm looking at Japanese cars to finally replace this clunker.  I got it with 41K miles and 10K miles later I had to replace a number of things.  The biggie was rebuilt transmission at 73K miles; since then it drives like a truck with it's 13 mpg.  The night mirror chemical dissipated soon thereafter, and now the car lurches to the left whenever I brake.  Volvo mechanics have been unable to solve this one."

car for safety and in both  models I 
barely escaped injury due to 
malfuntions of the car. This car at 
20000 miles died in the high speed lane

three lanes of traffic! A faulty air 
valve was suposedly to blame.Last 
winter my ABS went at 51,000..right 
after the warranty expired!!  That was 
a $900 repair. I just spent $500 on a

Leaking coolant, bulbs burning out, electrical issues (sunroof/electronic locks would go out/come back for no reason), alternator blew, interval maintenance is expensive. It's been in the shop the last 2 weeks because it doesn't want to start, no error codes and no one can identify the issue. Huge turn radius, it handles like a pig when navigating drive thru windows.

During ownership I experienced lots of problems-transmission, faulty air valves,sway bars, sensory issues, headlights burning out, suspension problems. I was thrilled when I finally sold the car. I had it almost two years, 22K miles and thousands of dollars later! I would not recommend a Volvo car. "

It has been well taken care of, when I purchased it had 57k miles, all service records are up to date. I am very impressed thus far. I would have to agree that visibility is lacking, but performance is great, and interior is greatly designed, there is lots of leg room in the back. Great for long trips to the beach."
volvo,s80,2001,lisag, 05/04/2009,Need to Build Them Like They Used To!,3,"Gone are the days when a Volvo lasted for 200,000 miles. I am on my third Volvo and can't say I would buy another one. The last one was a 1995 850 that I drove for 60,000 miles before the transmission went on it. I traded it for a 2001 S80, which I have loved, but now the transmission needs to replaced at 72,000 miles. $5,500 is a bit much to sink into a car with a blue book value slightly higher than that. These cars are great if you can afford to keep sinking money into them."
volvo,s80,2001,KJHOG92, 05/12/2009,"Great Drive, Bad Car",3,"I've had this car right after a transport company owned it for less than a year. Its great to drive, it's slow, but steering feels great, control is unbelievable. I've had this car up to 140 on the highway, was straight as an arrow, not even a vibration. I've taken this car on exit ramps at 80 mph. The car just grips the road. And it is so comfortable. I just love that aspect of the car. But the problem is the car isn't built right. The Sunroof has been replaced twice and doesn't work anymore, my front window barely work, everything is plastic and is just falling apart. New Tranny at 99,000 and the engine has an oil problem. And it sucks the fuel.  If you have deep pockets than its good."
volvo,s80,2001,Jay, 09/02/2010,Very Dependable and Durable Car.,4,"  I own a Volvo s80 2.9 and I already put in 161,000 miles on it and I don't have any troubles. and it depends on how you take good care of your car. I always use top quality brand, oils (Lubro Moly 5w- 30 synthetic), gasoline (91 and above Shell premium), Do regular maintainance  such as oil changes  and filters every 5,000 miles. Transmission oil and filter change every 35,000 miles. I regularly have my car wash."
volvo,s80,2001,Huck Finn, 09/17/2002,Pleasure to drive,5,"I admit that at first I was hesistant 
to buy the S80.  I had friends with the 
first model year '99 that had nothing 
but trouble.
My experience has been just the 
opposite.  The car has performed beyond 
my expectations.  Comfort and 
pleasurable drive.  Passengers have 
always commented on the comfort in the 
back.  Surprising acceleration for such 
a large vehicle.  No maintenance issues 
at all.  I am quite please with my 
choice and look forward to future 
offerings....a few years from now."

improvement from my 1990 760 was not

1997 Linclon Town Car that lasted one 
year. It still doesnt beat my 1992 
Acura that lasted from 1992-1997 and 
my wifes Honda Accord that lasted 1987-

handles nicely in sudden braking and in 
snow.  The version without the turbo is 
a tad slow off the line but is fine for 
passing in traffic.  It is quiet and 
solid, has given me no mechanical 
problems. Like the other 3 Volvos I 
have owned, light bulbs burn out on a 
regular basis. Safety features abound 
and makes one feel comfortable with all 
the aggressive SUV's around"
volvo,s80,2001,the g is silent, 12/15/2003,Black Beauty,3,"The S80 is a great car (especially in 
black), but is too much to maintain.  
The engine power seems underated 
because this car can really move even 
without the turbo.  Interior is 
pleasing and ergonomic.  Brakes stop on 
a dime.  The premium wheels dent to 
easily, and accelerating around turns 
can cause front wheels to hop.  Sensors 
short out in flashfloods, and warranty 
will not cover!  Loved the car, but I 
am glad the lease is up."
volvo,s80,2001,Garden State Volvo, 01/18/2004,NOT SAFE AT ANY SPEED AFTER 4OK MILES,3,"car literally started falling apart 
after 40K miles. Worst experience was 
electronic throttle die at 75 MPH, 
engin eshut down, leaving rocketing 
down the parkway without any STEERING.

Beyond that, car required major 
egition, air pump/valve, and suspension 
repairs before 48K.

Interior parts are cheap plastic that 
break regularly...replaced cup holders, 
air vents, radio face, and center 
console. 

Finally, rear visibility is horrible. 
Most of rear quarter panel and lights 
is totally blind....thank  god I don't

Definetly not in the league with Lexus

volvo,s80,2001,Paul, 01/18/2006,S80 suspension is not so great,4,The local dealer said they will not get any S80 until 2008 while Volvo does a complete redesign. I hope they improve the suspension to be on a par with the Infinity and Lexus. The S80 styling appeals more to me than these competitors but mine is simply awful when it comes to road bumps and manhole covers.

annoying problems. My turn signal works 
only occasionally-I just stick my hand

volvo,s80,2001,merlin , 11/17/2004,Its the small things,3,Bought it knowing it was a dealer loaner...that was the first mistake but the price was right. Replaced 6 bulbs of some type in the past two years. It currently has a headlight out to make #7. Replaced front suspension parts at 33K(under warranty. Sunroof has been fixed three times.Now a suspected broken motor mount as there is a thump in the steering at low speeds.  Dealership replaced the air mass meter at 45K under warranty. This is all on a $40K automobile. I cannot blame the dealership as they have been great but what is it that the Japanese know how to do that the Europeans do not?    After 20 years of driving Volvo's this may be my last!   
volvo,s80,2001,van w., 05/11/2006,keep a waranty,4,"extended warranty is a must. Volvo's 50k + mile warranty is all you need.

I have replaced VERY LITTLE (sway bar link, tires, rotors, not much else). Yes it has a TIGHT suspension, Volvo did that ON PURPOSE! They totally changed their look from the ol' square box and kept the infamous 2.9 L but turned it on its side and made it FWD (felt no different than my previous 960 which was RWD). Love the car, now I go on Edmunds and see estimated rating of 8.0 of 10.0 but much negative press from some of the owners. For the people crying about interior quality, know that the more a car weighs the lower the MPG, so when I see I can get 28 MPG in the safest sedan on the road, I AM OK!!"
volvo,s80,2001,nikjer, 10/13/2007,Wish I never bought this,3,"Light bulbs need changing monthly.  Cup holder, rear ash tray, seat belts, 18 undercarriage bolts, and center console all have fallen off.  Suspension had to be repaired twice.  Now have a new message that the gear selector does not work.  Noise from windshield is very high.  Cannot get radio fixed, static is constant on am and fm.  If I hit the lock button it will improve temporarily.  Front leather seats are cracking badly although I have attempted to maintain them.  Although car is paid for, I think a payment on a new one would be cheaper than keeping this one.  We drive our 98 Dodge Ram with 160K miles on it if we go anywhere more than 50 miles from home.  It is more reliable."

The car now has 150k miles on it with the original transmission, and it hasn't missed a beat.  I have only had to have the DSTC unit replaced ($800.00) and the brake master cylinder ($550.00), and I was able to do both jobs myself (neither was very difficult).  I get 27 mpg hwy and 22 around town.  I liked the car so much, that I have just purchased another one. I did have a problem with the radio reception, but I was able to fix it with a Volvo TSB that involved adding a brass strip to the antenna module, and now it's crystal clear.

it in the shop AT LEAST once a month 
for repairs (mainly light bulbs).  The

expensive  almost $300 for an oil

Carolina  ranging from rude treatment 
to incompetent repairs.  To make 
matters worse, the car is starting 
to loosen up.  At 45K miles, the car

volvo,s80,2002,Thomas Skinner, 09/08/2015,"Luxurious, somewhat fast, yet very problematic",4,"When I initially saw this car, I was hooked by the twin turbo inline six that sat under the hood.  I took it for a test drive and it was surprised at how quick it was, considering that it was a somewhat obese, front wheel drive luxury car.  I needed a ""reliable"" car to drive on a daily basis (compared to the 40+ year old Datsun I had been driving) and I figured I would go with the S80.  It had 160,000 miles on it, which shouldn't be too much right?  Only a few days after bringing it home I noticed a whining noise from transmission... Great.  Upon doing some research (which I should have done before buying the car) I found out that faulty transmissions are common for them.  Although aside from that and the buggy electrical system, it's a pretty good car.  It's extremely comfortable, the power steering it has makes turning a breeze, and it's a nice car to drive.  However I wouldn't recommend this car to a friend.

Runs better on premium gas - it does last a bit longer than regular though so don't let the price deter you. Great power, runs quiet, beautiful interior, can't imagine owning something better. Only complaint is that when a message like ""time for regular service"" or ""bulb failure"" appears on the message board, you have to have it erased when you fix the problem or it stays. I've gotta say, if that's my biggest problem with this car, it's a pretty great car. Great audio too. Highly recommend. "

I now own one and love it but I really don't like the fact that they won't do recalls for the front struts because I went to get mine checked and they were not very surprised that my struts were rattling and going out, they said it has been very common with Volvo, a very irritating noise and it make the car sound really junky, but other than that it's a very nice car if you can deal with a rattling front end."
volvo,s80,2002,Alan, 11/25/2010,Volvo struts,3,"I have had the car for about 1 1/2 years, bought summer of '09 with approx 90k on the miles.  The struts need to be replaced and the tie rods as well.  For a 75th Anniversary edition it has to have the worst radio I have ever had in a vehicle, ever!  Reception stinks and the speakers aren't that good either.  The key fob system for the doors is terrible as well with delays before the doors unlock and no horn beep when it locks.  I have one other problem with the power outlets.  Whenever something is plugged into them, such as my gps, it blows the fuse.  Something must be wrong with the electrical system someplace but I'm sure it would cost a small fortune to find the problem."

Repairs:
When I bought it, I replaced the water pump and timing belt. I have had this vehicle serviced one time to replace/fill all the fluids. I need to replace my upstream oxygen sensor (minor issue), which will cost around $130 for the part and is easily installed (or labor $40 for labor). Struts are squeaky in this model, but that isn't a
required fix.

Wish List:
This car has a terrible audio system. I have a 12inch long Skullcandy speaker at home that performs much better than all 6 speakers in my vehicle... which is sad."

I love the heated seats in the winter. It handles nicely, and its pretty fast for what it is. I'm not sure if I'd go as far to say that its the best car I've ever owned, but it is a beauty. I've had some problems with the tail lights, when I shut the trunk they'll go out and I have to whack them a bit to get them back on. The winshield wiper fluid got disconnected, not sure why.

volvo,s80,2002,Jim Howards, 04/22/2002,Great!,5,"I first checked out other cars such as 
Cadillac, Lexus, BMW, and Mercedes 
Benz. I didn't think Volvo could 
compare with such companies, but it 
did. I feel safe when driving and like 
a nascar driver because this car has 
lots of power! It is great in highway 
driving. No trouble getting up to speed 
and passing is a breaze too. City 
driving with this car is fun. My golf 
buddies have plenty of room in the 
back. Trunk space is plentyful when I 
am hauling 4 golf bags and boxes of 
golfshoes in there."
volvo,s80,2002,John D, 11/21/2007,Well built superior quality,4,"Well built, still very happy after 5 years+ of daily usage. 67k miles with zero problems. A pleasure to drive. Good mileage on highways. Everything works fine, distinctive design, swedish engineering.     "
volvo,s80,2002,Michael, 01/30/2019,"Perhaps the safest, most cost-efficient used car!",4,"This review is for a 17 year old car, which I purchased off craigslist.org last summer (I've now owned it for just over 5 months; logging about 7k miles) for the ridiculously low price of $1,600.00. When I bought it there were just 76,6xx miles on it. It had a clean CarFax report showing no accidents and 5 previous owners. It'd be understandable to assume, based on the above, that this car had been somehow neglected or was otherwise less-than; afterall, why would it have been resold so many times despite the unusually low mileage? Visually, the car is impressive. The paint is stunning. The wheels look almost new. The interior, save for the front passenger seat, is in amazingly condition. The glass, the trunk interior, the engine bay....all in amazing condition. Everything on the car works as it should- the windows, the air, the heater, defrost, indicators, brake lights, emergency flashers, sunroof, rear-seat head restraints fold down with the push of a button, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, intermittent wipers, etc. I've read reviews where others say the sound system is poor; personally, I find it totally acceptable except for the most 'spirited' listening occasions. The engine is strong, has no leaks and does not burn oil. I asked my local Volvo mechanic to check the transmission for any possible issues and he found none. I have had to replace one of the front strut mounts, and I understand this is a very common issue with these cars. This particular car was purchased new with the optional 17 inch wheels; tires for this car can cost about $225 each (cheaper options exist, yes; but, considering the weight of the vehicle and my driving tendencies I tend to prefer Michelin) but I found a set of 4 with 95% of the tread remaining for $250 (again, craigslist.org); $150 or so for mounting/balancing. DMV fees were very low as is insurance. We all know of the legendary reputation Volvo has around safety; this model is no exception. The car drives very well; steering is responsive and the car feels attached to the road. Perhaps more than any other vehicle I've owned, this car feels safe in the rain. It does not even hint at hydroplaning on the freeway during very heavy downpours. The front defrost system seems to have been adapted from an industrial application and is beyond capable of providing a clear windshield in any situation. The brake pedal is a bit soft, but the car is able to stop safely no matter what situation you've gotten yourself into. Back in 2002, this car sold for $39,745.00. In 2019, the value is between $1,889 and $3.512. (kbb dot com). Take a look thru listings on any site for used cars and try to find a safe, reliable, fully loaded 4=door sedan comparable to this vehicle for this amount of money. I don't think it can be done. Would you rather your son or daughter be in an old Accord or Camry (which cost more, on average, for a used car), or in this Volvo?
Update: have now driven over 25,000 miles since I bought the car used. Has never failed to start or get me where I’m going. It’s a heavy, composed vehicle and I feel safe driving it at and above highway speeds. It’s comfortable and dependable. Repair parts can be expensive (more than a Honda or Toyota but less than a Mercedes or BMW). And I like that it’s not a Japanese or German car. For a used car, I don’t think you can get more vehicle for this amount of money. Just make sure you find one that’s been maintained. The most expensive used car is a cheap used car that’s not been regularly serviced.

Transmission faulty, engine block was cracked on delivery.  Volvo did stand behind the 2 new cars to replace these two duds!!

much better than my old S70.  It is 
wonderful for long trips, although I 
wish that there was more leg room in 
the back.  I love the dual seat

like the car is buckling.  The smallest 
door bang turns out to be a large 
dent.  The doorjambs can&#8217;t be quieted. 
The sunroof is noisy and grinding.  I 
had upgraded interior wood installed by 
the dealer. Without the wood the 
interior looks bland. The front wheels 
have to be cleaned weekly due to the 
heavy brake dust.

standard automatic mode the 
transmission shifts smoothly, though in 
the manual mode there is a slight delay

duty light bulbs, the fuses blow as 
soon as the trailer is hooked up.
The hitch and trailer connection were 
installed by the dealer.

$1000 repair to the throttle assembly.
Volvo replaced parts at no cost even 
though it was 52000 miles.  I paid 
labor ($280).  Volvo said no more free 
parts.

It appears to need major repair every 
20000 miles or less.

The car is perfect for my wife and I comfortable, equipped with all the right 
features and no extra gadgets. It is our 4 th Volvo and the first front wheel

up.  That said, there's still a lot

safety is still there, the comfort and 
solid feel is still there, but it now 
has a skin that turns heads wherever I 
go.  I've had the car a little over a 
year now, and I expect to get many 
more out of the car.  More than a few

times than I dare to count.  Gas line problems, exhaust problems, would not 
take in gas, collant always needing filled, CD player needed replace, sun 
roof track broke, under mount was not in correctly, engine mount broke off, 
not to mention the big issue...the transmission completely went out.

lot considering that this is a front

I considered a 2005 Honda Accord 4dr or Toyota Camry SE, but could not see myself being happy with seats or radio, let alone the exterior styling.  So I looked at a certified preowned 2002 Volvo S80 4dr sedan.  This car had about 55K miles, and came with a 6yr/100k mile warranty.  With the big miles I put on, I felt the better deal was to buy preowned, get a $40K+ car for half the cost of new, plus get the super comfortable seats and safety design that a Volvo is noted for.  I am very happy with the experience, reliability, and dealership.  I love my volvo and hope to drive it 300,000 miles or more!"

The acceleration is neck popping yet safe; the braking system is very dependable; and the lights really show you the way. The heated seats are a definite plus, and the entire heating/air conditioning system does not take long to either heat or cool. This Volvo handles like a dream.

I have no complaints to Volvo but I would love to see them make a bigger sedand(around BMW's 7-Series and Mercedes S-Class size) because I have 5 children. But this car is great for those who are looking in the $40,000 price range and up. Volvo was always known for its luxury status to the rich and finally they changed their boxy style.

A car in this price range should have ample power. Take some friends out for a round of golf?  See what happens when it's time to put the bags in the trunk.  The seats are so inferior to the 900 series seats, it's as if it's not a Volvo (definitely unacceptable for tall drivers, the seat bottom is to small for long legs).  The plastics used in the engine bay are totally inferior when compared to older Volvos.  The glove box lever, the hood release lever, door handles, and dashboard knobs are unacceptable for any Volvo."

volvo,s80,2003,tlg, 03/02/2016,GM transmission take it to the junk yard,2,"update 9-5-2017 interesting this email! Gauge cluster just went out this CAR. Thought about letting it go but i still will not even come close to anything near the miles and money ive put in it. 
i personally have spent years trying to avoid the over engineered under quilty of the electronic and unreliability services of GM products. After owning my fist volvo 2001 S80 2.9 non turbo i was in an accident totaled the car loved the car had 178000 no problems other then rack and pinion. Purched my next very shortly after found 2003 s80 t6 2.9 turbo. car appeared nice after buying before making the first payment the transmission went into limp mode. taking to have looked at found the vehicle had the GM 4t65e transmission witch i would have never even considered the car if i would have known that it had a gm part in it. There is only 2 other vehicle they are in that ive found other then gm products. That is the volvo s80 and the XC90. IN the years around what i have. I am so disappointed in this car im going to have over 10000 in a car worth 6000.Volvo has really disappointed me now i have a car that wont run and haven't made the 1st payment.payment. Mechanic says you are lucky to get 100000 miles out of the transmission. All i can say is im disappointed in volvo now. Just after replacing the transmission the fuel pump went out. Now with 95000 approx. The front end needs work so basically i will have to drive this car for years. Wish i could post pics of the wonderful advertising sticker swartz auto in harrisonburg va put on the back of it. Was going to remove but instead put a sign above it that says do not buy from. They were horriable for there customer service. I will never recommend or buy from them again.

Decided not to take the chance on the Trans again had over $1000 in it sold it for $2500 less then 30000 miles ugh. Win some loose some sure was a nice riding car.

volvo,s80,2003,Mark Lewis, 06/11/2007,Good car!,4,"This is an excellent car.  It's fun to drive, and it gets good gas mileage.  I consistently get 430 miles to the tank.  The only problem I have is that the rear passenger speaker produces static.  Other than that, the car accelerates well, takes turns well, hugs the road and has plenty of amenities.  The trunk is very large.  The hinges fold into the side and not into the well of the trunk.  It gives you more space.  That's especially important when you are grocery shopping for a family of 5!  Overall, it's a great car.     "
volvo,s80,2003,puchpuppy, 02/14/2009,Major disappointment,3,Purchased car with 33000 miles and have been beset with any number of very expensive problems. The most expensive problem was replacing the fuel pump at 43000 miles at a cost of $1000 dollars and suffering an overwhelming smell of gasoline for a month afterward. Now there is a check engine warning that shows a code of failure of fuel system. The estimate on replacing the sensor is in the neighborhood of $800 dollars. The suspension system needs realignment every two thousand miles or so. Am on the third set of tires. Continually replacing headlight bulbs and other bulbs. I am 82 years old and have drive Volvos for years and I do not misuse a car. Am bitterly disappointed with this car!
volvo,s80,2003,Jack B, 12/22/2004,Good for the money!,4,"I have owned the S80T since Aug 2003 
and have mixed feelings on the car. 
Decent acceleration & Braking.  
However, the turbo lag can be somewhat 
annoying. Love the Stepronic like 
shifter.  

The interior of the car is cheap.  
Tons of plastic.  Volvo saved a ton 
going this route.  If you have 
experienced a BMW, Lexus, or MB, you 
will be dissapointed.  The main reason 
I bought the car was for the seats.  
These seats are incredable!  
The Stereo rocks when playing CD
's.  However, the AM radio stinks.  
Several trips to the dealer to solve 
the ear popping crackling and 
interference have failed to solved the 
prob.    

Good Performance, Cheap interior, 
Great seats. 15K less than a BMW."
volvo,s80,2003,Two Out Of Three , 05/08/2003,66% Unhappy With This Cae,3,"Leased three S80 T6's in Jan, 01. Two 
of us would never buy one 
again. Quality isn't there 
for a car in this price range.  
Electronics have been terrible: 
numerous bulbs replaced, shorts in one 
car, bad seals around the headlamps, 
the driver's seat on one rocks during 
acceleration or braking.  
The cars have high cost of ownership: 
never had a visit under $500, unless 
it was for a recall,which we've had 
three or four.
Mileage makes us believe this is 
prevelant throughout, after three 
years we have one with 70K, another 
with 55K and the last one has 45K.  
BTY: Consumer Reports in April of 2002 
ranks the S80 and the S60 as ""do not 
buy""!"

EXTREMELY noisey"
volvo,s80,2003,MR. BIG, 11/24/2002,OLD VOLVO OWNERS-Your Reward is Here,5,"This is a fabulous automobile and quite 
the sleeper. It is a big sedan in the 
Euopean sedan tradition that uses space 
rather than wastes it. Performance is 
on par with sedans costing $15-20K 
more. And what boy racer in a Honda 
would ever expect a Volvo to blow right 
by them? The car handles the twisty 
stuff with sure-footed comfort. 

This is my 5th Volvo and my favortie by 
far. So far we only have 3,000 mi on it 
with no negatives. I have paid my dues 
with old Volvos. I am a fan. This is my

much as I LOVED the car, I always 
regretted not getting the T6 package, 
premium sound, and color-coded trim.  
When I got this Pearl White 2002 T6 
(with color coded trim), I was in 
utterly speechless; the seats where 
even more comfortable and the handling 
and responsiveness of the T6 is 
fantastic.  And the sound the 3rd 
channel and DPL are great.  With the 
exception of the mild dead spot when 
shifting from 1st to 2nd gear and the 
fact that the premium sound does not 
play MP3s, I really have enjoyed the 
high end responsiveness of the car and 
the sound system.  At 130 mph, the car 
is just beginning to beg for more."

The 2001 was terrific and this one has been even better.  I bought it in CA but live in TX now.  The drive across country was very comfortable and I take this car whenever I have to go on long trips.  This is my NINTH Volvo since 1974 - but I've had lots of other vehicles as well.  The lease just expired on this one but I bought it and will keep it for a long time to come.  Volvo of Orange County CA is the best dealer coast to coast.  I've had Volvos from Boston to Houston to California but V.O.C. is the best!

volvo,s80,2003,Carbuff, 12/27/2008,Excellent cruiser,5,"Volvo has a fine automobile in the S80 T6. Mine has been trouble free; the key to which is regular maintenance. I also recommend a transmission service or flush every 40,000 - 50,000 miles at the dealer. If you plan to keep the car for several years, the servicing you do will pay dividends. This is a fantastic automobile for long trips and highway driving; especially good for moving people in comfort. Fuel economy is much better at cruising speed on the highway; you'll see dramatic drops in start and stop city driving. Highly recommended!"
volvo,s80,2003,Matthew DiMangiano, 02/01/2003,Second Volvo S80,5,"I bought this car for my wife in 
December of 1999 and just traded it in 
for her second. Awesome drive 
especially in snowy weather. I own many 
luxury and exotic cars, this being my 
second favorite sedan next to my 2000 
Rolls Royce Park Ward. Volvo is 
amazing, they have it all safety, 
performance, technology, and in recent 
years since they removed themselves 
from the boxy look, elegant style. 
Volvo has always been popular at 
country clubs and with opulent drivers 
and I would take this over the Acura 
3.5RL and Lexus GS300 anytime. An 
alternative to this car is the Jaguar S-
Type although it's rear wheel drive 
does not handle well in inclement 
weather."

the performance and added features.  
The car is fantastic except for one 
problem: hesitation during 
acceleration.  The car hesitiates 
between 1st and 2nd gear under 
moderate to heavy acceleration.  After 
four trips to the dealer I discovered 
the hesitation problem is designed 
into the car to save the tranmission.  
Volvo is working on a software patch, 
however, I was told the acceleration 
hesitation will always be noticed.  
Why make twin turbo model if the 
throttle is cut during acceleration?"

notable problems. The car failed to 
start when almost brand new and the 
dealer asked if I had another set of 
Volvo keys on the same keychain! It 
appears that their keys contain a 
microchip that has caused starting 
problems if together(this was not the 
problem in my case and they couldn't 
diagnose the cause). The dealer never 
mentioned this problem when I bought 
the car. Windshield wipers are weak and 
the car is not nearly as good as my old 
1997 Saab 9000 in the snow. I have had 
difficulty making it up some very low

rattles when volumn is not too loud. Was told the some noises are ""born with"", 
noisy at low speed, not enough power to accelerate into traffic. Wife refuses to

have standard leather and sunroof which 
should not be optional. Also the wheels

more sportiness accuracy of bmw 5

"
volvo,s80,2003,G, 04/09/2019,"Very Comfortable, Little Else Going For It",2,"This car is by far the most comfortable I have ever driven, and performs its purpose as a safe comfortable cruiser adequately. Reliability seems variable. Many online seem to like this, but mine has never once worked properly. It constantly told me various electronics are not working, and stalls at random below half a tank. Also the stability control is worse than useless in the snow, cutting power at inopportune moments such as entering intersections in slush, or getting oneself unstuck from a snowy driveway. 

I have replaced the fuel pump for $700 at a Volvo specialist's garage, which was cheaper than a dealership would have done it for (regular mechanics would not work on this car in my area).
As someone with sporty tastes, the 2.9 trim is lacking. The acceleration is at best marginally faster than my previous 30 year old Honda Accord that made just over 100 HP, and steering/handling is vague at best and occasional disconcerting in the apparent lack of connection to the wheels over bumpy roads. The car also torque steers noticeably under acceleration.
Overall a decent car for someone who wants to be insulated from the road and float down the highway, if they can stomach new BMW maintenance with none of the performance typically associated with it. It makes sense why my grandmother bought it, but it doesn't work for a broke college student.

volvo,s80,2004,Christopher Chao, 12/07/2015,A family of Volvo drivers-,5,"i bought this car at a Volvo specialist center in 2012 with 125,000 miles for just 7,998. I was going to use it for a year, due to a short term job in New York, so I didn't really care about what it was. My mom drives a C70 and told me to buy the car. It has been absolutely fantastic, now in 2015 we have 156,000 miles on it and it's still going strong. There have been some expensive maintenance costs (150$-550$ services) and also suspension and axle components (1000$ over the years) but the thing to remember is that it's European and our X5 costs 3 times more to maintain. For such a nice car I'm willing to pay some more. It is important to note that I go to a local Volvo service specialty shop, and NOT A DEALER. Prices are about half what I would pay there, and even more savings for used parts. Also this car is ultra safe, my two kids learned to drive in this car, and this holiday season I plan to give it to my oldest... And of course as a replacement I'll be sure to buy the new XC90. The best thing about this car is the amount of small features that really add up: price, gas mileage (I get 35 on i40 even when the epa says 26, and yes I actually calculated it along with the trip computer), safety, (there are 6 giant airbags and stability control is an option fitted to my car), cold starts (never had a problem in -20 weather, AV/heat( the best ever, I'm never hot or cold for more than a  minute, and the seats are so supremely comfortable. And that's all for 8,000$!!!!

It wasn't fault free needing a few somewhat random repairs: $400 for a new security system computer, tie rod ends $600 but the engine and transmission were great.  Seats are super comfortable and durable having no cracks or rips.  Not a 'sports sedan'  but the i5 never made merging or passing difficult.  Best car I have owned.

The other driver went through a stop sign hitting the passenger side right at the wheel and c pillar with enough force to spin my car 180 degrees.  Car had about 203,000 miles at the time and was totaled by the insurance agency.  When I bought a new car I ended up not buying another Volvo but have regretted that decision ever since.  Older S80s are a great car and if you can find a well maintained one, even if it is over 10 years old, it will be comfortable and reliable.

volvo,s80,2004,2004 2.9 S80, 01/02/2008,S80 Reliability,1,"At 79,000 miles this car is on its third transmission.  The front struts have broken through nornal driving.  It has had two leaks of transmission fluid.  The second leak required the radiator to be removed to replace a hose.  The interior design makes it very difficult to see traffic behind you.  This is our third (and last) Volvo.  Repairs this year alone came to over $4000. "
volvo,s80,2004,TravisScher, 06/19/2003,What a steal!,4,"I leased a new S80 a few months ago and 
I got a better deal than you could 
imagine! I had an S80 before this one 
and I leased it for $500 a month but 
when that came off lease I got a new 
one for $390. I was considering an 
Acura RL, Lexus GS and an Audi A6 but 
none of them compared in value. I found 
the volvo the most comfortable and I 
love the T6 engine, although it was not 
worth $150 more a month. "

response and great exceleration is one 
of the many features that I like. It 
also gets great gas millage. hwy.30.5

long trips is great I had no drive

I recomand the volvo to all my friends. 
I look forward to buying another one 
soon for my wife. The volvo also has 
great leather seats. "
volvo,s80,2004,jimmi, 07/16/2010,Big Disappointment,3,"I've had my car since almost new. For the first couple of years, it performed well. It went through routine maintenance. After 100k, problems started happening. In the last 3 months I've spent over $4500 on repairs, from buying a new axle, brakes, brushes, repairing leaks...etc. (remind you this car goes through extensive routine service). The car has a nice title, but it comes with a price. Volvo is not the same Volvo we've all knew growing up. It's a Ford 500 :-(. I really don't want to buy a new car, but I'm being forced to because I refuse to put another dime on fixing it. I'm looking at more practical cars like, honda, acura, toyota, lexus.  don't recommend a volvo, new or used."
volvo,s80,2004,David Floyd, 09/30/2008,My Volvo S80 T6 experience,5,"Great road car, excellent fuel economy. Repairs include the heat/ac fan motor and controler, regular maintenance. Very comfortable for me, a 6'2"" 245 lb man to take on a trip. Classic styling, starts whenever I need to go. Wife loves it."
volvo,s80,2004,Lince, 02/19/2009,Great car for low price,5,This is my 3rd Volvo over the years and I would say this is the best so far. Great design in and out. Enough room for 4 adults . Very comfortable ride. I am thinking about brand new Volvo S80 now. I would say this car car is way underpriced as a used car.
volvo,s80,2004,freeheit, 10/04/2003,Like the Germans Used to Make.,5,"Despite its attractive exterior, the 
Swedish Volvo S80 is a sensible no-
nonsense sedan like the German's used 
to make.  Yesterday my neighbor and I 
were noting how much more my 2004 S80 
is like his old Mercedes than the 
current Mercedes are, both in the 
Volvo's sturdiness and high-quality and 
in its lack of Jaguar-esque 
friviolity.  

If Volvo could have completely 
refrained from its (admitedly minimal)
use of fake wood (or any wood) in the 
interior, the S80 would be the worlds 
most perfect car."
volvo,s80,2004,azsteve, 01/18/2007,A good find,5,"Having owned many cars in 30 years and many test drives of rentals during business trips I can say that this has been the best car value for me to date. The 2004 2.5T sedan seems to be a good reliable model year. I get 29 MPG average and can't believe the smooth power. Volvo did a perfect job matching the engine and transmission in this model. I have done ALL of my own auto repair and maintenance in past years including engine and transmission rebuilds. Knowing what I know I am very impressed with the build quality and engineering in this vehicle. I am very happy with the comfort, ride quality, climate control, and interior."
volvo,s80,2004,Jim, 10/29/2015,Has been great for me!,5,"I've had Volvos for years. The last Volvo I had had 300,000 Miles on it when I sold it for $1,000. I just sold this one with over 200,000 on it for $ 1,000 and bought a 2007 Volvo XC90.
"
volvo,s80,2004,SIM Wortham, 09/29/2018,MASTER MECHANIC,5,"Volvo's are the best cars built,I own three and I'm about to buy another. I'm a mechanic and they are the easiest cars to work on! American cars are not worth the money because you're lucky if you get 100,000 miles out of it before it needs major work done on it because the dealers complained that they weren't making money of of selling them!
"
volvo,s80,2004,Anthony, 12/26/2008,One Reliable Fuel-Efficient Tank!,4,"I bought my first Volvo in 2005. It is a white S80. I can't say enough about the car. My previous car was a Lexus ES300, which I loved. But after moving to the suburbs and ommuting on the highway I decided to go for the safest on I could find. The car moves for a almost 4000 lb tank! The ride is quiet an agressive. It handles like a smaller sportier sedan. The best part is that when some cowboy in a goofy truck rides off my bumper he slowly realizes my white tank is not giving way. I have a 17 ft.great white sharks tooth hanging from the rear view mirror, reminding me of speed, unexpected stealth, and power- and that's what you get in the S80!   "
volvo,s80,2004,Ken, 01/26/2008,Very disappointed,3,"After extensive research, we picked the 2004 Volvo S80 cause it seemed reliable and comfortable for my height - 6'6"".  Only the 2004-2006 models could I fit in. Since we bought the car from dealership, we've had it in for service 5 times and after the last service where they couldnt fix the acclerating problem when braking, we've decided to cut our losses and find another vehicle. Other problems included seat belt squeaking, windshield wiper timer, headlight adjustment, brakes, and more. Disappointed the car turned out to be lemon."
volvo,s80,2004,Howard, 06/28/2008,Don't buy 2004 Volvo S80,2,"Ford engineering has obviously ruined Volvo. My wife preferred the Volvo to a Lexus based on exterior style, but now regrets the decision. The car has major electronic failures about every 4- 6 months and required towing to the dealership twice. Also required the ""company"" to send someone out for figuring out the repair. We got this car for a reliable vehicle to drive on the road for trips, but I would use my 1986 Subaru GL10 or 1993 Toyota T100 4x4 rather than this Volvo. It was painted white, but should have been yellow to match its lemon qualities. Do not buy this junk or you will regret it!"
volvo,s80,2004,dbaill, 08/13/2014,Very dissapointed,2,"I bought my volvo 8 years ago.
I have fixed this car so many times.
Fixed windows not working three time, motor mount broke, throttle body needed cleaning, lights quit working, I owned three different toyota vehicle and put over 150,000 on each and have not had problems like this in any one of them.
Would never ever buy another one"
volvo,s80,2004,camaro1781, 06/02/2008,Best Volvo yet,4,"My 2004 T-6 is the fifth Volvo I have owned in the past 15 years. Previous versions are the 240,760 Turbo, S70, and a 2002 S-80. The 2004 is clearly the best Volvo and the best car I've owned to date. I bought it with 33/k miles and I currently have 82/k on the car. It looks great and handles very well in all the conditions that Minnesota can throw at a car. "
volvo,s80,2004,j.maclain, 07/25/2003,"outstanding car, s80",5,"We purchased our S80 back in January 
and We are very pleased with its 
performance and reliability thus far.  
We had a 1978 volvo 244dl that we drove 
for 22 years and we sold it with 
265,000 miles on it 3 years ago, and 
every now and then we still see it on 
the road.  So we have nothing negative 
to say about volvo and will drive them 
forever, infact we just took delivery 
of our new volvo XC90, and it's 
everything they say it is.  Thanks Volvo"

out..and the spacious interior, not to 
mention the comfort.  I am recently 
experiencing electrical problems...my 
fuel tank release button randomly

volvo,s80,2004,Leo L, 01/24/2004,S80 owner - 2nd time,5,"Great ride, smooth performance, very 
responsive to breaking and 
accelaration - superior quality!  Owned 
a 2K S80 which was totalled in a 
meeting with a power pole (perfect 
safety performance in the accident with 
no broken glass and no significant 
injuires).  I immediately came back for 
the 2004 2.9.  Easy to drive, very 
adequate acceleration at highway speeds."
volvo,s80,2004,S80_T6_2004, 01/27/2004,"Luxury, Comfort, Safety",4,"The S80 is truly an underrated family
sedan. For those who look beyond the
sometimes biased reviews and the glitz
bestowed upon sportier alternatives,
one will discover that the S80 rewards 
its occupants with a comfortable and 
supple ride.  There's power when 
needed, courtesy of the twin turbo 
engines, and advance safety features
all around, both externally and 
internally, to provide that extra 
comfort that in the event you may need 
it, you're in one of the safest car on
the road today."

handling and all the safety features 
included. had a 2001 s80 and when that 
lease was up didn't hesitate to lease 
another s80. my husband is still 
driving our first volvo a 1990 740 that 
still rides as good as it did when we 
bought it almost 14 years ago. my 
daughters each ahve a jeep and a honda 
accord and always want to drive my 
volvo no way get your own!"
volvo,s80,2004,SPike, 02/04/2004,3rd One's a Charm,4,"3rd Volvo in 13 years; this one is 
superior.

. With 2 booster seats, the extra rear 
passenger surpasses all other models 
in it's class.

The ride is extremely smooth, my wife 
is prone to car sickness, not in the 
S80

It's nice to drive a lux sedan that 
has a bit of ""individual personality""; 
doesn't look like all of it's German 
and Japaneese counterparts with 
their ""generic hi-tech"" styling..

Kudos to Volvo for entering the new 
millenium and exporting their 
traditional safety and reliabilty to a 
style and level of comfort that is 
world class."
volvo,s80,2004,Nathan W, 03/24/2004,I've wanted one for years !,5,"So far I really like this car.  I have 
been looking at the Volvo but could 
never afford it.  Now I finally got it 
and as long as the great Volvo quality 
stays as high as it is I don't think I 
can ever drive another brand!"
volvo,s80,2004,Robert Linscott, 04/08/2004,Never Again,3,"S80 2.9 - 2000: This car has been a 
total headache for our family.  The 
car is always falling apart. 
Electrical night mare, from lights to 
locks to sensors.  Hub bearings X 5, 
sunroof falling apart, hub bolts 
falling out twice while on vacation, 
broken coils spring, faulty fan motor 
for radiator, oil flame seal bad, and 
a bad motor mount.  So much for the 
flagship of Volvo.  The S80's market 
value is poor and still is rated as 
less than average for the 2004.  No 
wonder the BMW and Mercedes lines are 
so popular.  My first volvo and 
definitely my last -never, never 
again.  Waltrip Volvo in Nashville 
area loves to see me, and my checkbook 
on a regular basis."
volvo,s80,2004,Bob Erfle, 05/19/2004,Wonderful Car - Fun to Drive,5,"The 6 cyl (non-turbo) moves this full-
sized car very well. I look for excuses 
to go for drives (or steal it away from 
my wife & take it to work!). The trunk 
is very roomy. The Safety features are 
and have been one of the primary 
hallmarks of Volvo  they dont come 
much higher rated"
volvo,s80,2004,J Williams, 07/13/2004,The first 7500 miles,5,"I choose the S80 because my previous 
cars have been standard V6 sedans. The 
S80 is by far the best sedan I have own 
or driven. Leaving Denver in April, 
there were 12 inches of snow on the 
ground but with my DSTC on and working 
I had no problem with driving or 
staying on the road (other cars and 
trucks, even 4x4's slid off the road) 
and holding a steady speed for road 
conditions. I made it though the snow 
storm until the DOT closed I-40 at 7200 
feet elevation. The moto ""For Life"" had 
nothing to do with my decision to buy 
but  I'm glad I did. The only thing 
better than owning a Volvo, is having 2 
Volvo's. I have the XC90 also."

years and never thought I would find a 
car that I wanted but the very first 
time I sat in my S80 T6 I was sold for

Wow!! I was hooked from that point on.  It drives great looks good and has all the pick up that I need.  Had my heart set on a Lexus, but not after driving the Volvo.  Love it and will look for another one when I need a car.  I have taken it on 2 long trips already and I get over 30 miles to the gallon.  If you haven't driven one don't wait. It is very comfortable and I'm not a little guy either."

handles like a truck and steers like a 
truck.  The break and accelerator 
pedals are dsngerously close together.  
The brakes are very unreliable. Some of 
the time they engage near the top and  
at other times I have to push all the 
way down before they engage.  The

Within the first 100 km the exterior 
chrome molding has started to come off. 
Within 200 km the gas pedal does not 
function properly, one must depress it 
a full inch before there is any 
response. This is most annoying, and 
the dealer tells us that nothing can be 
done about it, that its just the way 
Volvo makes them.

For the cost, I am exceptionally 
disappointed in this car. It now has 
less than 2000 km on it and we are 
about to trade it in on an Audi. 
Remember its really no longer a Volvo, 
its an expensive Ford. "
volvo,s80,2004,La Vonne Stewart, 02/04/2006,volvo ownership,3,Sitting in this vehicle is comfortable but Ido not like the center console.  It is not convenient to have a cup of coffee while driving.  And that mickey mouse pop-up console drives me baty as it doesn't hold anything properly. i also dislike the control for the side view mirrors.  Your 1986 model was much more efficient.  I hate having to hit the right or left first then adjust.  I've had better steering wheel adjustments.  Take the 1983 Tyota for instance. I don't really feel I have complete control of this vehicle.  It in a way controls me. And I would prefer push button passing gear..like the '91 240for instance. Also there's not enough room for C.D storage nor does it fit properly.
volvo,s80,2004,Ed Herbert, 12/10/2003,Volvo for life!,4,"Never thought I would drive a Volvo. 
Those old boxy looking cars with 
underpowered engines.  Met up with a 
Volvo sales rep, he told me about Volvo 
today.  I tried an S80 T6. Always 
wanted an inline 6 with turbo on a BMW. 
Now I have 268 HP, inline 6 with twin

T6 (option: climate and xenon, no four 
C available in the area).  Volvo was 
not even in my original list.  I was 
looking at E class, 5 series, A6 (all 
2004).  Also compare it to 2004 acura 
tl, saab 95/93.  None compare to volvo 
value (5k below MSRP with factory 
incentives - thanks Edmunds), comfort 
(most comfortable seat) and initial 
quality (check the finish especially 
around the trunk)"

first 2 months in the shop dealing 
with a heavy vibration at high speeds

rattles.  This car did not impress 
upon me the quality one would expect 
for $46K.  An inept service department 
and crooked dealer certainly didn't 
help resolve my ill feelings either.  
After four months of ownership, I am 
trading mine in (another reflection of 
Volvo's quality is reflected in its re-
sale value).  Watch out!

If you are looking for an impressive

I've done the Bimmers, Benz, Jags, etc. 
but this time around the Volvo really 
caught my eye. I first took a close 
look at the S80 T6 when I went to turn 
my Jaguar S-Type back in to the 
dealership (who also happened to be a 
Volvo dealer). Once I got the S80 out 
for a test drive, my mind was made up. 
Who would have thought that a front-
wheel Volvo could be so much fun to 
drive!!! I've had to put up with a 
few 'old guy' jokes from friends when I 
told them I went 'Volvo' but their 
criticisms usually stop once they come 
for a ride."

best choice for price, comfort and 
convenience items.  My passengers are

volvo,s80,2004,t1952, 01/30/2004,Excellent - This one is # 2,5,"This is a great car !  I liked my 2001 
model so much that I bought the exact 
same car, color, and options again in 
a 2003 model.  Cross country trips are 
a breeze loaded up with the partner 
and the animals ! Now located in TX, 
we continue to enjoy this vehicle and 
will buy another next year.  A few 
changes to the styling would be nice 
and some more insulation to make it as 
quiet as a Lexus would be even better. 
Volvo seats are unbeatable.  This one 
is Volvo # 9 for this family along 
with many second cars including BMW, 
MERCEDES, VW, LEXUS, and others."

volvo,s80,2004,Francis, 03/24/2006,My 2nd Volvo,4,"The S80 was my second Volvo.What influenced my purchase was the Edmunds information which said the 2004 had 700 enhancements, most of which you could not see. This was the first model year that Volvo replaced the 2.9 6cyl with their famed 2.5T/ 5cyl engine. The recommended fuel is premium but the car's computer consistently shows 25-26 mpg combined city/hwy driving. Almost no perceptible Turbo lag when you press on the gas.This is great considering the car weighs 3,600 lbs."
volvo,s80,2004,John Blaze, 04/03/2004,Strongly recommend,5,"Overall this car has been a pleasure to 
drive, and has made me feel much more 
comfortable about driving on the road 
with the fleet of SUV tanks. The inside 
is comfortable and spacious, and the 
seats are soft and luxurious. The S80 
has a super smooth ride, and handles 
like a sports car, so I get a good feel 
for the road. Its lines are sharp and 
it has a more unique look than other 
luxury cars. 

The two biggest problems I have are the 
acceleration and the side view mirrors. 
You need to exert too much pressure on 
the gas pedal to move the car from a 
stand-stil. The side view mirrors are a 
joke, they are so small. "

not be happier with the vehicle.  "
volvo,s80,2004,spike2, 11/24/2004,A Near-Perfect Car,5,"I never owned a Volvo until I bought this for my 
wife.  It quickly found its way into my 
hands - a deal I could only swing by agreeing to 
buy her a new XC70 wagon as a replacement.   
Neither of us can imagine owning any other brand 
now.  This car is perhaps the most complete vehicle 
one can own.  It has just about everything - 
unsurpassed safety, good performance, acceptable 
reliability, room, AWD, the most comfortable seats 
I've ever experienced, and an understated elegance.  
I have around 8000 miles now and have had no 
problems.  Like other reviewers, I now look for any 
excuse to drive.  Despite Ford's ownership - this is 
still a Volvo at heart.  I absolutely love it."

tried the earlier versions, they didn't 
quite have it.  The new S-80 T6 relaly 
has the power and acceleration needed 
in this car.  They somehow tinkered 
with the transmission and gave it more 
life.

comfortable.  Lumbar supolrt

volvo,s80,2005,nickosmith, 07/10/2012,Just a great car to own,4,"I have owned this car for just over 3 years ..and i must say i am loving each and every bit of it. This is my 1st Volvo and i did a lot of research and found that 2005 or 2006 S80 were the best compare to older years. I never had any problems because i have maintained it well. If you are looking for older design S80, then got for 2005 or 2006 year model. 
i always wanted a Volvo with turbo and i was going for S60 but i found same price and bit higher mileage an S80, and had more leg room and some neat options. And i was glad i made that decision. 
These cars are built solid and feel firm on road. And
good mpg considering its size. I guess its a small engine with turbo. "
volvo,s80,2005,louc, 12/08/2004,First New Volvo in 20 years,4,"The S80 is a tremendous improvement over
by last 240. The interior is much more
comfortable, guages and controls are
excellent and the front and rear seat
room is much improved. The ride is firm
but very supportive, with very little
road noise. The performance is very good, 
the turbo operates without lag, fuel economy has
never been below 24 MPG. The car is a 
tremendous value whencompared to a BMW 
5-Series or Lexus. I have not had any initial build
problems, but have had many on my SAABS
and BMWs."

It's the perfect size, gets really good mileage and is Swedish non-nonsense luxury personified. No Lexis toys in a toy, just quiet and comfortable safety that you can trust, all in understated elegance. It also had the ability to lock in car seats for my twin grandsons that many cars to not - which is still another safety feature."

my wife & I very pleased with the
performance, comfort and luxury of this
automobile.  I ordered the Four C
chassis, combo climate/warm weather
package and the Bi-Xenon lights as we
live on the Gulf coast and have to
contend with heat and fog.  We took the
car on a cross country trip to the mid
west and the Four-C was awesome in the
hills of Kentucky and the heated seats
came in handy during a cold snap in
Michigan.   I did have 2 small problems
that were immediately corrected by the
dealer: mis aligned headlamps and a bad
fuel pump sensor that caused the check

have gotten the kinks out of this model.

volvo,s80,2005,Richard L. Turner, 03/19/2005,Great Car,5,My Volvo S80 is a very comfortable car to drive.  The neck and back support are the best I have ever had in a car.  I can fold the back seats down for transporting goods and groceries.  The car has a great pickup at about 270 horsepower.  I own three volvos and will stick with volvo as I feel they are one of the safest cars on the road as well as being powerful and comfortable.  The outside style has dramatically improved since the old box shaped volvos.  I can't ask for a better car.  The service dept. at West County Volvo has always been friendly and efficient.  Proud to say I don't have to take my volvo in very often.

I was fortunate to find an amazing deal on such an amazing car! I have only had to take it in for scheduled maintenance and two out of maintenance issues (hole in radiator and key fob malfunction--both covered under CPO warranty). We also own a XC90 with the same engine, and the two are like night and day. I would recommend any person purchase this vehicle, especially with the 2.5T engine (has power and great on gas-31 on highway). Currently the S80 has 70,000 miles, and anyone cannot believe it is that old. You will not be disappointed! "

I have to say it handles as well as a BMW.  This sedan is spacious, even with 3 kids in the back, and one of them in a car seat. The car is a very classy car but yet it has a nice sporty flare.  The turbo definitely gets this car out of its own way.  The most important factor is its safety rating.  That is why I bought a Volvo in the first place.  All the features and controls are easy to reach without feeling like your going out of your way, or taking your eyes off the road.  Highly recommend this car to anyone who wants extra value and safety for their buck!!"

volvo,s80,2005,Statik, 03/23/2009,Bought Used,4,I researched a few vehicles and liked this car because it could fit four adults and a car seat comfortably. The base engine feels stronger than my v-6 mustang. It has good traction and it is well designed inside and out. I also enjoyed the 100k pre-owned warranty from volvo came with it even though I bought it from a private party. I would recommend this car to others.

In comparison the S80 2.0T is underpowered at 190 hp.  It's slow off the mark but once on the highway its brilliant and comfortable all the way up to 180km/h after which it gets choppy.  This would not have been the case with the S70 or 850GLT which has superior power to weight ratio and better handling.  I recently went to BSR Sweden and reformatted the OBD. And now it runs at 225 hp which makes it a whole lot more economical to run in town and performs like stink in excess of 230 kmh.  I had to shod on a set of 18"" rims with 235/40 series tyers to keep the car on the road.  Overall this car vs my Merc Coupe is good."

Here's what was done: new struts, serpentine belt, fuel filter, MAF, coil packs. Then a transmission service urgent light came on at 78k miles with long upshift.

Better ride with 60's or 65's and tires would last longer.  All in all, you can spend a lot more money and I don't think you can buy a much better car.  We've owned Volvo's since 1978.

This car does better at higher speeds - think of it as a highway cruiser. I drive mostly highway using premium fuel and average 23 to 24 mpg. There is a 2nd A/C outlet on the center console facing backseat that is good for folks needing more than 1 outlet (just snake your cord between console and seat if you need to be tidy).

My 2002 Toyota 4Runner SUV seemed to have better acceleration. Handling is a bit sketchy as well. HOWEVER, what I did buy this car for... comfort, safety, quality, value - it's a homerun. Compared against some of the other luxury sedans, this is a value buy and a good entry level luxury sedan.

Far and away the most reliable car I've owned. Great acceleration and near flawless Volvo safety features. And still looks sharp.

volvo,s80,2006,david718, 03/26/2009,Fantastic Piece of Machinery,5," I have wanted a Volvo S80 ever since the new design came out in 1999. Although it took me till 2007 to purchase a used 2006 S80, I feel that I have scored big. The exterior design is sleek and looks good from every angle. All lines look proportionate and the headlight and tail light assemblies are ""Jewel-Like."" The interior is refined and practical with a ""Watch-Like"" dash, wood trim and comfortable heated seats. The plethora of options make driving a pleasure and you will wonder how you ever drove without them. The turbo provides enough acceleration when needed and I average about 24 mpg. Quality of finish and mechanical components has been very good and service from dealer exceptional."

Acceleration is excellent; reminds me of a Chevy 350-4 barrel v-8 I once had.  Road feel, suspension and braking are outstanding.  Owning this car makes me feel like I just want to hit the road and throw it around a road course.  It makes driving fun again."

Brakes are good too.  Overall pretty smooth but noisy on coarse pavement. Ride can be somewhat harsh.

The dealer told me that I could expect to get up to 24 mpg around town (really, I asked twice and had it confirmedVolvo only says 20 mpg). I am lucky to get 17.5 mpg, and I am driving very conservatively (with a combo of local and highway). When I asked the Dealer, I was told that the mileage was probably due to the car being AWD. Funny, that isn't what he said when he was trying to sell me the car. Also, Dealer said to use regular gas (in spite of Volvo recommending super unleaded). I am in the process of upgrading my fuel and hoping to see the numbers improve. Otherwise, I love this car."

Volvo could pay better attention to maintaining their reputation of producing a quality vehicle.  Reliability rate low for this model due to transmission noise when shifting from park to reverse
volvo,s80,2006,SM, 10/05/2005,Volvo Sedan review,4,"Very pleased with the handling especially in the winter. The AWD is smooth and responsive. Would like to have features such as compass, GPS, and or Navigational software. Exterior has a clean line and I love the feeling of safety and confidence I have knowing my family is riding in a Volvo. "
volvo,s80,2006,Dave, 04/01/2006,"Nice looking, needs work",3,"We chose this car because it was the best looking with the most interior room in its class.  It is very comfortable, but the engine is woefully underpowered.  Gas mileage lists between 20 and 27 mpg, I drive mostly highway and cannot get above 19 mpg, very disappointing.  Little annoyances:  there is only one button for lock/unlock. If your door is unlocked but passenger's is locked, you must hit the button once to lock all doors, then again to unlock all doors.  Homelink garage door opener should be standard on a luxury car, is instead in the convenience package which is expensive now that they include the back up assist.  It is a beautiful, underpowered car, with minor annoyances.  "
volvo,s80,2007,rustysmith, 08/15/2014,Still a great car after 100k miles,5,"2nd Update: Sold car with 182k on odometer. Every repair done on the car us listed below. Went to a Honda Odyssey for the space, but the S80 was an incredibly reliable car for nearly 200k miles.

Update: currently have over 160k miles. Only repairs have been a steering sensor at 110k miles and A/C components at 150k miles. For 11 years and 160k, I don’t have a single bad thing to say about it.  



No problems after 135k. Rock solid car.

Originally bought it for the seats because of a bad back. Reliability has been superb and fuel economy better than EPA ratings. Seats and leather are world class, and the ergonomic interior is nice. I've come to love the fuselage-like look and design of the floating center stack console.

There are trade offs with everything, though. The ride is stiff. If you like the ride of a Honda Accord or the BMW 5 series, you'll like the S80. I'm in my car an average of four to five hours a day, and those aren't pleasant rides for road warriors. That said, I'd buy it all over again. The comfy seats make up for the poor ride quality and the factory Dynaudio premium sound system is amazing. I'm even happier with my car today than I was five years ago.

volvo,s80,2007,bdhulk, 12/29/2006,Amazing car!!! Best I have ever owned!!!,5,"This car is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage, and is by far the safest car i have ever owned (which has become very important to me with a new baby!). I have owned both Mercedes and BMW's in the recent past, and this car is more exciting, and has more cool features than either one of those! there is this thing call the BLIS (blind spot information system) that tells you if someone is in your blind with a light on the front A pillar... Very cool, and useful!"
volvo,s80,2007,tacomatim, 07/24/2012,Best car I ever had,5,"I have driving Volvo cars since 1979. This is by far the best Volvo I have ever had, and I can also say the best of any cars I ever had. It run smoothly, sounds great (typical of a V8 with dual exhaust), runs economically and still have the necessary power when needed. I highly recommend it!"
volvo,s80,2007,Clayton Barnes, 04/09/2017,Sweet Ride,5,"I purchased my S80 from the local dealer, it was traded in on a S90.  9 years old, 39000 miles, near as I can tell it never spent a night outside.  The butter soft leather seats are heated, the cab is library quiet.  A handy pass through from the trunk makes the car practical for the occasional trip to the hardware store or more frequent trip to the ski hill.  I've enjoyed one winter, a winter where my hometown of Billings ranked #4 in the nation for snowfall.  The car never faltered, even plowing through seemingly endless series of rutted city streets and making it through the graveled country roads I often travel to see clients.  Now, this 2007 model does not have the now ubiqtuous center stack of video screens and endlessly distracting electronic gew gaws.  The six disk cd changer, superb audio system, and the ability to tie in a ipod or other gadget is wonderful, it is also set up for satellite radio, but I haven't activated it.  Being a child of the 70's and 80's, I enjoy everything from ZZ Top to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, all of which are perfectly enjoyable either in the car or, cranked, two blocks away.  With no distortion whatsoever.  The dash is clean, laid out very well for the driver, the materials, fit and finish are excellent.  The interior lines are best described as understated elegance.   Roadmanners are superb, the twin turbo, 300 hp straight six is a delight to drive.  One arrives at 100 in no time at all, I have no idea what the top speed is.  I do know it is awful fun to pass those long trucks on two lane roads, far more than it was in the Ford Freestyle this car replaced.  Long drives melt away at a delightful clip, 80 is legal in Montana on most Interstates, 85 in good weather doesn't even get you a blink from the local Highway Patrol.  The sunroof is a welcome option.  In short, this is by far the nicest vehicle I've ever owned, and the purchase price of a mere $14k (Volvo's suffer from undeserved depreciation) was the icing on the cake.  I only drive around 15k or so miles per year, so this car should last me, assuming I don't manage to merge with a wayward deer, many years to come.  If you are fortunate to come across such a vehicle, drive it.  Have it checked out.  Assuming it checks out well,  treat yourself to a super sweet ride.  10/18/2018:  Update:  This car is still super sweet, due to some family challenges I have been driving a Ford E150 conversion van much more than the Volvo (only 6k miles since the original review), which makes the switch oh so much nicer.  Only problem has been a glitchy electrical connection on the drivers side door that affects the Blind Spot Indication System and the controls for the windows.  I'll get it fixed when it goes in for the oil change in a month or so.  I've had service work done at the Volvo dealer, so far no horror stories with respect to cost, they have been fast, efficient, clean up the car, and deliver it back.  My opinion remains the same, this is a fantastic vehicle, if one gets the opportunity to own one at a fair price, assuming it checks out ok, buy it.

volvo,s80,2007,10gallon, 11/13/2010,finicky ride,4,"I purchased my S80 (V8) from a local Volvo dealer and overall have been quite pleased with the car. I didn't really consider any other semi-luxury vehicle, as I was a valet at a major casino in the past and really got to experience everything under the sun. However, be prepared to constantly be addressing small issues, this car is very finicky. Premium fuel is a must to avoid ""mis-fires"" cauing the check engine light to come on. The TPMS system requires at least 38lbs or it will activate. Rear-view mirror was recalled by Volvo and the new one seems just as bad (won't stay put). Also, this car should have Sirius and Bluetooth as standard equipment. Don't get me wrong, I would buy again! "
volvo,s80,2007,CHKLONDON, 03/19/2010,Outstanding,4,"I looked for 3 months before buying. I got a great deal and enjoy the car. Its loaded and has 9 more items my 2001 did not have. I enjoy the adjustable chassis feature that adds dimension to the ride. The V8 kicks in beautifully when I need to pass, a thrill.  Its silver and I often walk around the car and admire its elegance. The ventilated seats feel great, sound system is wonderful.The Navigation system will get you there but sometimes it takes sub optimal routes. Maybe its me?  I looked at certified BMWs and almost bit but the Volvo is a better value. Also the sides of a BMW are somewhat drab and too close to the ground like an old ladies skirt."
volvo,s80,2007,Tyler, 08/16/2016,"Owned for 3 years, best decision I've made.",5,"Reliable, powerful, great in all weather, comfortable, well-built, and safe. The V8 is worth the extra cost at the pump.

volvo,s80,2007,jeffd, 12/30/2009,Great Euro Luxury Sedan Value,4,"This car is beautiful, inside and out.  Good headroom for tall people, and decent legroom in the back, especially if the seats in the front seat are not 100% back.  Good MP3 interface (hint, buy the $10 cable from Radio Shack and don't purchase the option). The mileage on the highway is impressive (around 27 mpg), but around the city is not (around 18 mpg.)  The range of the car is a little underwhelming, but the controls and audio are fabulous and easy.  The AC works very well, even in a very hot climate.  No leaks or air noise, as this is a very 'tight' car.  I always thought the old S80s were boring, but with this redesign, the inside and out never get old to the drivers or passengers."

This car is very comfortable and has plenty of power to spend.
I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking into buying luxury midsize sedan with AWD system that works."
volvo,s80,2007,TWHACKSAW, 01/10/2010,WOW,4,"Test drove several CPO's to include Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and Acura's and didn't find any to be as comfortable, safe and as fun to drive as the S80 V-8 AWD. While it may not be as sporty as a 5 Series or as luxurious as an E-Class or Lexus, it is the best total package. The AWD has proven itself to be a winner during this harsh Iowa winter. I've never felt as safe and secure driving through snow as I do in the  S-80. Added two 9 inch DVD screens to the headrests so we can use it instead of the Minivan in bad weather. Best part- wife didn't blink at the price because she loved the  S-60 we had previously. Personally I think the V-8 is the way to go, but I'm sure the T-6 is fine as well."
volvo,s80,2007,kryfka012, 11/22/2011,Best value for the dollar in luxery,4,"I never thought i would own a volvo bc i always liked the luxury sport feeling. when i saw the volvo s80 it caught my eye, and when i test drove the v8 it had the power i wanted. with the adjustible suspension i would wip it around the turns and take of when i need to. i think this car is great and it feels like it was built with great quality to the touch and eye."
volvo,s80,2007,birdman, 11/13/2008,Great value for money,4,"I've now driven almost 7000 miles with my S80 V8. No mechanical or other problems. Sound of the V8 is great, very civil background roar without getting obnoxious. Mileage isn't so bad, with average driving (city and commute), I get 24mpg highway and 18mpg real average. Don't agree the body styling is boring. The old S80 was pretty boring but the 2007 & up model has a nice refined look, to my taste.  "

Last leg of trip, 1400 miles, got 31.4 mpg with average speed of 65 mph.  Best ever.  It was comfortable, responsive, easy to drive at up to the 90 mph we cruised on some Utah & Idaho roads where posted speed limit was 80.  High winds didn't bother it.  Neither did some sharp mountainous turns.  Good job, Volvo!  MUCH more responsive and comfortable than our 1999 XC-70."

Drove a few cars, but came back to the S80 because of price and the fact that I haven't seen any on the road.  While nothing handles quite like a BMW, I've been pleasantly surprised with this car.  It's super comfortable, has all the bells and whistles (air conditioned seats, nav, keyless ignition), and is a joy to drive.  Plus, the stereo system rocks!  I plan to put on some 19"" or 20"" rims.  Very cool car with some very cool features.  "

volvo,s80,2007,Chuck from Haverford, 12/04/2019,Best Decision I Made For A New Car,5,"I've owned a number of high end cars such as Infinities, Mercedes, and BMWs. My company was doing a lot of business with Ford back in 2006 and we were offered a nice price break on Volvos, which Ford owned at the time. So I took a look and decided to buy one. Now almost 13 years later, I have 90,000 miles on it and I expect will easily do another 90,000 with few if any problems. The seats are more comfortable than in my wife's Mercedes. Long drives are almost a pleasure. Granted a BMW may handle a bit better, but I'm not driving at Le Mans. It still looks great and the interior looks new. Repairs have been minimal and I trust it will continue that way. The instruments and controls are super easy to use. Just had a new Mercedes loaner and could not figure out how to get an AM station on the radio. No problem with my Volvo. It's clearly marked. Little things make a big difference. I could not be more pleased.

I started with 850, then to the S80 2.9, the S80 AWD 5cl turbo, and now, the all powerful S80, V8.  What a machine!  Loaded to the gills. Only hiccup: guzzles gas like crazy!  But if you want power from a Volvo?  This is the one to get.  Plenty satisfied and sharp design also."
volvo,s80,2007,NY Driver, 08/17/2007,The Best Yet,5,"This may be the ultimate Volvo. I now have 3000 miles on it and like it even more than when I bought it. I most seriously considered the Infiniti M35 as I wanted to try something other than a Volvo (I have owned 5). However, safety concerns, gas mileage, and the way features are packaged individually led me back to the Volvo. A test drive of both cars sealed the deal. The Volvo seems to have a better feel for the road. It is smooth, yet extremely responsive both in handling and acceleration. It is the best Volvo yet and may have already sold me on Volvo the next time as well.  "

The ride is smooth and the response of the different modes (comfort, sport, advance) are great. The seat are extremely comfortable, the gas is great for this size vehicle and the ride is ice smooth. I receive compliments every where I go. Some say it looks like a Benz. Its sporty yet elegant at the same time. Great Job Volvo!"
volvo,s80,2007,necostanzo, 06/12/2011,Great car. Solid and reliable. Poor gas mileage,4,"I bought this car used with 64,000 miles.
It is a great looking car that is extremely well built.
Much more solid than the 2005 Audi A6 I owned (that car had more rattles than a 10 year old Yugo).
Seats are very comfortable, however the natural tanning process they use is not resistant to normal conditioners and cleaners (I cleaned the dirty drivers seat and it removed some of the tanned leather on the right side of the seat bottom bolster).
The gas mileage is poor as compared to other V6's in the 3.2l-3.5l variety.
My Audi A6 got about 27-28mpg hwy and this car only gets about 25-26mpg and it is only FWD and less powerful. Saturn Aura got 29mpg. Great car, solid reliable, poor mpg."

I had a 1999 S80, and after many issues with that car, I looked to Lexus, BMW, and Mercedes.  After test driving the 2007 S80 and comparing it to the competition, the S80 was the best car for the money.  It drives like a dream and the amenities are endless.  It is simple, elegant, easy to use, and sooo sexy!  Only wish she was a bit faster - but dealership says there will be a software upgrade for the lag.  Simply the best!

Over a 2 month period, drove to the Riviera, back north through Italy, Austria, Germany, and Scandinavia (for home shipment). Lots of driving in crowded cities like Paris, winding back roads as in Provence, Austrian mountain roads, and German Autobahns... the car performed flawlessly. We averaged over 23 mpg in what I would consider some extremely demanding driving conditions and speeds (think Autobahn with cruise set at 150 KPH). On European roads, this is definitely a large car. But it drove nimbly and had no trouble running with the little guys. My Austrian/German relatives and friends thought the Big Swede is a veritable Rocket!"

Excellent performance including almost 25 mpg fuel economy. Car was a joy to drive in the Alps as well as the Autobahns. In small towns and crowded metro areas, this is definitely a big car. But its size gets respect  on the Autobahn as smaller cars yield to this big Swede."

volvo,s80,2008,itsvolvosafe, 12/18/2011,I love her,4,"I bought this vehicle because it was a much better value than comparable BMW and Mercedes models and it also does not come with the pretentious stigma commonly associated with owning one of this cars German competitors. My previous vehicle was a Mercedes ML 320, it had many problems and was worth less than $5,000 when I bought my S80 and I still got more comments from people about the vehicle that I drove. The S80 has a subtle presence while still offering most of the power and luxuries that come with owning a BMW or Mercedes. It is not as dynamic as a 5 series or a powerful as a E550 but it still has as much power, performance and comfort as you could want in an everyday driver."
volvo,s80,2008,qroberts, 02/25/2016,Used 2008 S80 Nicer than Most New 2016 Vehicles,5,"Just bought one of these used for around 12K and have been floored by the quality of the vehicle.

I went out looking to buy a new (2016) vehicle but just was not impressed with any of the sub 30K offerings. I haven't bought a new vehicle in 18 years (drove a 1998 Mitsubishi Montero for that entire time) and I was expecting the offerings to have changed substantially in that time. Instead what I found was pretty looking vehicles with terrible visibility, cheap interiors, frustratingly anemic CVT's and lackluster fuel economy. If I'm going to drive an unresponsive brick I expect it to get close to 30 MPG overall, not 21 city 28 highway. My massive, old clunker of an SUV got 18 city 25 highway and was fast to boot.

So I was pretty disillusioned and decided to go have a look at some used vehicles. Our family has had many Volvos and apart from replacing turbo seals (an issue they have apparently resolved since 2001) never had any issues with them at all (and I'm talking not a single one of them has ever failed to start or had a single mechanical failure over about 40 years of combined driving, 5 cars over 8 years each).

So I started looking and was quickly interested in the AWD S80's particularly the turbo inline 6 or T6. I test drove a 2008 with 64000 miles and was elated. The car is solid as a tank, looks new, smells new, feels glued to the road and is a ROCKET! I bought the car as soon as we got back to the dealership.

The vehicle is a little slow getting through the first 3 gears unless you give it a little more gas but once it's going and especially on the highway, the car is untouchable. By far the fastest most responsive vehicle I've ever driven or ridden in with the exception of a standard BMW M5. 

The ride is really smooth with almost no body roll even in tight turns and you feel glued to the pavement. The AWD is definitely noticeable versus front and rear wheel drive mostly as a reluctance of the car to deviate from the line it's on until you turn the steering wheel.

Like I said in the title, every aspect of this 2008 S80 is nicer than any new 2016 car I test drove and that includes safety features. You'd be a fool to pass on this car if you have a chance to get a low mileage one.

volvo,s80,2008,stevep, 08/08/2010,Understated Elegance,4,"The 2008 S80 is my first Volvo purchase and I have to say I am very, very impressed. The attention to detail and quality of workmanship is outstanding. I have owned Lexus (GS and ES) and infinity (G35) and although good cars, the attention to detail is not as good as Volvo.  If the long term reliability is as good as consumer reports rates the 2008, then I can see myself buying Volvo's for a long time.    Performance is outstanding. The 280hp T6 is very fast, especially if you use the tip-tronic shifting.  Yes, there are faster cars, but I don't think anyone balance of elegance and performance that the Volvo S80 does, not to mention its claim to fame safety features. Don't miss this one"
volvo,s80,2008,Mike Schumer, 09/06/2015,The understated luxury car,5,"The Volvo S80 is a great car if you don't care about status but still have luxury. It is one of the safest cars on the road. Yes it's ride is so comfortable and disconnects you from the road but that is nice sometimes, especially on long trips. I own a Mini Cooper so I get my road jollys with that. People complain about the inadequate performance of the base engine. I find that to be a ridiculous statement. It's not a sports car, it's a luxury sedan that handles any road situation under normal circumstances. This is my second Volvo, my first bought new in 2003 and still have it at 235,000 mile. Volvos are known for longevity. Yes maintenance and some problems will arise but it's not as expensive as a BMW or Mercedes and will probably outlast both of them. This is a practical luxury car. It's not for people that care about what others think or how fast you can go from 0-60. I got Volvo's 2008 flagship with 48,000 miles on it for $12,500. Not bad for a car that should be around at 235,000 miles.

Update: after adding 25,000 miles to it, there have been no problems. Drives great.

volvo,s80,2008,JB, 12/13/2016,Fantastic Vehicle - Understated Excellence,5,"Ordered and picked up for European delivery. Fabulous experience, seamless and excellent handling by Volvo from A-Z. Now NINE YEARS LATER - my S80 AWD V8 - looks and drives like a new car..  Volvo service has been incredible and I've had very few issues. I get an occasional check engine light that is difficult to diagnose. Resetting solves the issue. The radio broke. Volvo replaced it out of warranty no charge parts and labor. What don't I like? The rear seat room is a little tight, though the front is awesome. Very supportive seats for long hauls. The car uses premium; but in a vehicle of this size the transverse mounted V-8 makes the car a rocket ship (when needed). The pearl white metallic tri coat paint is an industry best. Five stars on a nine year old car in showroom condition - still turning heads - Ask me in another nine years! Love it.

volvo,s80,2008,BJS, 08/27/2009,It's a sleeper,4," I've looked over the internet an have reviewed many comparison among so call luxury sedans  and the comments shared here, and what I am finding is that most people really have not driven the new  S-80, 287hp, AWD,T6. I have had mine  now for 19 months.  If you desire sport and comfort it's a excellent choice. However, not many autos can compare to the ride the Lexus 350S in comfort, but the Lexus lacks speed, handling and power. It also is a (front wheel drive)car. However, the combination of power, and torque will change your mind about the S-80 AWd/T6, it will run with a 7 series BMW. Do you hear me!!!!!!!!!!!! Two months ago I raced a 7 series and KEPT PACE, UP TO 120MPH  for 100 yds"
volvo,s80,2008,max Perkins, 08/01/2010,Great Value for the Price,4,"This is a great car!  We looked at BMW's/Mercedes and decided on this Volvo as we felt you pay a lot for a BMW/Mercedes name.  This car drives like a dream and is SO comfortable to ride in.  Have take it across country and had no back/muscle fatigue.  It is very responsive, has great power and gets much better gas mileage then we expected.  The T-6 is the features we were looking for in a ""sports"" car.  The body design is very nice and we see people looking at it all the time.  4WD's are hard to find but we wanted that for the extra security when driving (lots of rain where we live).  We hope to get at least 200,000 miles out of this car.  Would highly recommend."
volvo,s80,2008,Fräckt!, 01/21/2019,Bye bye BMW,5,"I got a great deal on my 2008 T6 AWD S80, as it was a high mileage trade in. I paid almost nothing for it and it is the best car I have ever owned in just about all aspects. I was an avid BMW guy for many years, until I realized that BMW stood for Bavarian Maintenance Whore. I put more in maintenance on those things that I bought them for. While this particular S80 is not the color combination I would choose, meadow green with a brown dash and a tan interior, that put it firmly in the sleeper category. This thing is very quick, agile and comfortable. It is a virtual tank in the snow, I can't tell you how many Jeeps I would have tried to pull out of ditches, had I not liked this car much (but I didn't want to tear it up). The only two things I have had to fix so far were the headlight wiring (it was about $50.00 and a few hours of routing) and the air breather (it was about $75.00 and half an hour labor). It has over 200K on it and still looks, feels and rides like new. I'm a Volvo fan for life!

UPDATE 07-28-20
Still loving this car, it is amazing in all weather and just pure pleasure to drive.
Wanting to get an additional XC70 Cross Country too now.

volvo,s80,2008,amcdad, 04/13/2008,Excellent Luxury Sedan,4,"This is a competitive class, and the S80 competes well with all around competence. Good handling, top of the line safety, excellent comfort, and options that make the driving experience all the more pleasurable.  The safety is key- compare the IIHS crash tests to the Mercedes E and BMW 5- and you'll be surprised that those companies charge over $50,000 for a car that doesn't keep you safe. The 281HP S80 T6 has plenty of oomph, and the handling, while not in the BMW's league, is a lot better than Volvo's previous sedans have been. Most will enjoy it just fine. The Dynaudio stereo upgrade is worth the money- 650 Watts of the most incredible car audio you'll ever hear. All in all- love it!"
volvo,s80,2008,chelsofpdx, 02/15/2010,Impressed so far...,4,First luxury car purchase and I am too pleased.  The comfort of the seats and feel of a tank are definite positives on the road.  3-choice steering package a must...advanced option makes it like buttah!
volvo,s80,2008,doctordick, 08/16/2007,Driving goodies,5,"The basic vehicle is fantastic, but some of the goodies available make it really special. I especially like the adaptive cruise control; it takes a bit of getting used to, but it's amazing on the highway, slowing you down when you come up on slower traffic and speeding up to your set speed when its out of your way. The vented seats too are wonderful on hot trips, and the ride adjustment is most helpful when you get into mountain roads.  I have some reservations about the run flat Pirrellis but can't complain specifically yet.  Plenty of power, very comfortable, and great to drive!  I strongly recommend trying one!"
volvo,s80,2008,jay2001, 04/09/2008,Great value,4,"Great value for the money. Comfy ride, decent power, high safety ratings. A lease payment of under $400 on a $40K car was just impossible to pass up. "
volvo,s80,2008,Halmarc, 12/24/2007,"T6 S80, The Perfect Car",5,"This Volvo T6 S80 has to be, the best car I've ever owned.  It is the perfect balance of performance, comfort, safety and handling, with decent fuel economy.  I run it on regular unleaded gas and it's very fast.  In fact, I haven't floored the gas pedal yet.  It's good off the line and when passing.  That was not true of the MB E350 that I test drove.  When compared to the E350 and BMW 530, it's as good a car for about $15000 less.  Try one, you'll buy it."
volvo,s80,2008,Scott E, 12/03/2008,Best value proposition,4,"Needed AWD in New Hampshire mountains and the BMW, Benz, and Audi alternatives in this size class cannot touch the Volvo - and I am a huge fan of BMW.  Purchased the car this summer during the $4/gallon gas era and got a fantastic deal that the other brands could not touch.  Nice quiet ride with adequate power - not as well balanced as the BMW5 - drives a little front heavy in some cornering.  Bottom line is that I would still purchase this car should I move out of the snow belt given the price point.  Interior/exterior styling is excellent - don't see too many others on the road so it has a nice unique look relative to Audi, Volvo S60, 4matics, etc. which are everywhere."
volvo,s80,2008,Randy, 01/26/2008,"Have a Bad Back, Finally Comfortable",5,"The Volvo S80 might be the most comfortable and supportive car on the market.  My wife has had a bad back all of her life and many surgeries. This car has seats designed by chiropractors and orthopedic specialists and it beats all of the luxury cars out their for comfort, 3-level heated seats front and rear with power adjustments that make it perfect for any sized person. Combine that with whiplash protective seats, the best safety features available and you have a comfortable car that if in a collision will also protect you.  I do a lot of research when buying a car and this is the car for the issues I have identified. Combine the price, build quality, engineering, comfort wow!"
volvo,s80,2008,dstogsdill, 02/23/2010,Terrific Vehicle!,4,"I picked up my 08 S80 at the end of 09. This S80 had every option that Volvo made for it in 08, including the navigation, rear dvd system, and adaptive cruise with lane departure and collision warning. The car is made for cruising and is extremely comfortable and has a solid and powerful feel. The safety features are truly advanced and work well. In fact, due in part to the BLIS and Lane departure systems, I feel my driving has actually improved. The T6 is very quick and has tremendous power in all situations. Of course, we will have to see about the reliability of all these advanced features, but so far the car has made me fall in love with Volvo!"
volvo,s80,2008,stu silbergleit, 04/13/2008,Solid car,4,"This car feels and is solid. The drive is extremely smooth and the heating system (both air and seats) are excellent. The seats are luxurious, stylish aand very comfortable and supportive."
volvo,s80,2008,christopher jahn, 01/28/2017,A leather trimmed Tank,4,"The turbo of course takes premium gas.  She's a pig for it at a staggering average of 17 miles to a gallon.  So if you've got an aversion to 60 or 70 dollar fill ups his isn't the Volvo for you.  Additionally she takes synthetic for the first 78k miles and then a blend to 120 making oil change pretty costly for the first few years.  I've had this girl since she was new and I'm trading in for an S90.  It's got 91000 miles and all it ever needed was motor mounts (400.00 bucks) and brakes (600.00 bucks). She's does eat up rear brakes a bit but not at an alarming rate like say an Audi does.  I believe this wear is related to the small pad size and the overall weight of the car. It's a heavy car, probably make mostly of rocks.  Tires will set you back a cool 800.00 bucks because you'll need a low profile extra wide bus tire to take the weight.  The seats are great, better than an S class Mercedes or any Lexus in my opinion. The interior is laid out in an elegant simplicity that is very Swedish and logical giving you a much more relaxed driving experience.  If you like your car to have enough buttons all over the place that it looks like a space ship, get a German car, they dig that look.  Overall this is a good car.  It was reliable beyond anything else, including my old S70, and it has enough power to let you move about with confidence.  My primary gripe would be turning radius.  This car by far has the worst turning radius of any car I've ever owned.  You'll need to take a wide shot to get in and out of spots so it's not for the faint of heart when it comes to parking this big girl.  Additionally the sat radio antenna is weak.  I small stand of trees or a bush easily disrupt the signal. In the end it's a Volvo, they pretty much go forever and I'd recommend even an old one like this as a great used car at a good value.
"
volvo,s80,2008,Matt Bernsen, 07/06/2008,Very Comfortable,4,"I am very impressed with this car. It's the most comfortable car I've ever driven (most recent cars were Passat & Murano). Very elegant, simplistic interior, eye-catching exterior and solid construction. My only complaint so far is the fuel consumption (20 mpg avg - high for a V6)"
volvo,s80,2008,KEN WALL, 07/14/2008,S80 3.2 a great car,4,This car is a great value for mid 30's range. Its quality is second to none. This is my second Volvo and it is really a tight and great riding car
volvo,s80,2008,Dave M, 07/23/2008,Nice car but has a very rough ride,3,"My S80 is a well built car, but after owning it a couple of weeks, I'm extremely disappointed in how rough the ride is. I called the dealership to see if they had could order shocks that aren't as stiff but they tell me that none are available. Their recommendation was to decrease the tire pressure; not much of response if you ask me. Next time, I'll be sure to test drive a car on something other than the dealer's recommended route."
volvo,s80,2008,Smith, 08/03/2008,Pleasantly suprised,4,"We also own an 04 XC 70 and I do not like driving it so I was pleasantly suprised by the S80 and the different feel it had in comparison.  It has great styling and it is nice to drive. The interior is quiet and the sound system is good. The engine could use a little more go, as we never test drove the 8 cyl or turbo but would recommend doing so. It is economical for gas (why we chose the 6 cyl) and love the AWD."
volvo,s80,2008,First Time Volvo Dri, 10/02/2008,Very nice Car,5,"I never thought I would be the owner of a Volvo, but fell in love with the safety features, and torquey engines. Although critized I find the ride quite smooth and as pleasant as my wife's Mercedes. The car feels like it floats, and such is not as engaging as BMW, infiniti or alike. The car rides like a cruiser. The car has great passing power, but feels a little slow off the line. The interior is all soft to touch and feels like reserved luxury. You can tell all controls were put in place with safety in mind. The Navi is placed on top of the dash and is operated via steering wheel controls to minimize driver distraction. All audio/car settings can only be adjusted when the car is stopped."
volvo,s80,2008,WC , 02/07/2009,A Sporty Sedan fo Volvo Lovers,4,"Good year-end deal for current Volvo owner on '08 S70 w/Sports Package. Smart style/profile;Great alternative to BMW or Audi; A very comfortable/roomy sedan with a sports car feel. Love rear visibility (drop down rear headrests);Accessible controls;Many convenience features, e.g. auto-folding rv mirros, smart key, heated/cooled f/r seats; Runs on regular gas. Would not have chosen low profile tires-expensive, impacts turn radius and mileage. "
volvo,s80,2008,Tall Volvo owner, 05/10/2009,Nice car but next time a turbo,4,"I just purchased the 2008 3.2 S80 (I have had it for 48 hours); I like the look of the car interior and exterior.  The car comes up short with the handling; it has a floaty feel to it and I live in Europe and have driven Audi's, Passats and Lancias.  These car have great pick-up; this car does not; you learn a lot about a vehicle when taking a trip from Germany to Italy through the mountains at night.  Overall I have to say it is a nice car but the suspension needs work; Turbo is necessary if you want to get that extra kick when you need it.  Also, some features should come standard with the car, e.g. blue tooth, front and rear warning detection for parking.   "
volvo,s80,2008,darryl greer, 01/13/2008,Performance and Comfort/Reliability?,4,"I've leased 12 cars in 20 years, including the original S80 (1999), which did not prove to be very reliable. After examining Infiniti, BMW, and Audi, I leased the 2008T6. It is extemely comfortable, and quiet.The engine performs on par with our Jaguar XJ8. The transmission is smooth, as is braking. However,compared to cars in this class, there is a slight tradeoff in handling, if driving agressively; and gas mileage could improve (averaging 18 in mixed driving). The interior is elegant in its simpicity, but the rear seat has been downsized. Unfortunately, after 1500 miles I had to return to the dealer with an airbag fault, which was quickly repaired (faulty software).Overall, very satisfied."
volvo,s80,2008,dgreer, 10/05/2009,"2-Year Update: After Two, No More",4,"This updates comments from 2 years ago, as the lease nears expiration. After 30K miles the suspension creaks and pops just as my 2000 model.Replacement parts by dealer never fixed the problem, It's built in by design flaw. Gas mileage has improved to 21mpg, mixed;and 27hwy.But my '04 Jag XJ8 is better:22/30, and much more fun to drive. Engine and transmission have been great, but small problems mount up, including warped brake rotors at 28K. Maintenance is relatively expensive, but is included on 2009-10 leases. Overall, a nice car; but at in this class,over $40K, I won't lease another, and would not want to purchase for the long term."
volvo,s80,2008,Isam, 11/25/2009,The new standard,4,"I have owned this car since 6/2008. What a pleasure to drive! I have adjustable suspension option and the car handles very well even on the comfort setting. I do not know how a BMW can beat that but I can tell you that the advanced setting will glue the car to the road. The ventilated seats are something very dear to my heart. The inside beige color is very elegant. I have an option that lets you change the degree of stiffness of steering. So you get Lexus soft and BMW stiff if you want.  I have about 12,000 miles on it without a single problem so far. The xenon lights that move at night give the impression that this is a more expensive car. I truly believe that all Volvos now are the best"

volvo,s80,2008,Gail, 01/16/2009,Noisy & uncomfortable ride,3,"I leased the S80 at the end of Sept. I have noticed that the tires made an awful loud noise when driving moderate & high speeds. The wind noise at 50+ mph is unbelievably loud. I have been back to the dealer twice, 3 tires were replaced because they were defective. The tire noise & vibration is still there. the tires are Continental. My owners manual had tire info for 2 other brands. I guess Continentals are cheaper for Volvo. I am shocked by the poor ride from a supposedly good company. My VW Passat rode much nicer. I drive the same highways to work an hour each way, so noise is very upsetting. I will try to go up the ladder for the tires I should have had. I was told the wind noise is norm"
volvo,s80,2008,HNH, 01/13/2008,A great car,5,"Looked at the usual German, British & Japanese luxury brands, and just when I was about to buy a Lexus, decided to stop by a Volvo dealer.  The S80 T6 seemed to have what I was looking for: understated luxury, solid build, strong engine, comfortable ride, nice stereo and a reasonable price.  A great value."
volvo,s80,2008,Mikevm, 01/30/2008,Very nice car,4,This car is beautiful inside and out.  Wonderful new design.  Volvo did a great job staying true to their style but making it look way more current.  My friends say it has sort of a BMW look to it.  Plenty of power w/the V6.  Nice ride both in the city and freeway.  My only challenge is that it seems to have a rather noticeable hesitation when starting from a complete stop when accelerating slowly.
volvo,s80,2008,TommyB, 03/25/2008,Nice Ride,4,"Excellent vehicle for the price. With the rebates they are offering you just can't compare to the German and Japanese alternatives. With all the safety features, very safe ride. All controls are very intuitive.   "

It drives great, and eventhough I don't have one of the larger engines, the car has plenty of pick up and go even on the German autobahns.  I love it!  Living in Europe, we travel a great deal, and already, the S80 is proving to be a comfortable, luxurious ride.  Couple that with Volvo's safety record, and this car provides the best of both worlds.

Seats are very comfortable."
volvo,s80,2009,MAD, 06/21/2009,Totally Satisfied,4,"I test drove cars from Audi, BMW, MB, Acura, Infiniti and Lexus -- Leased a Volvo S80 T6 AWD. It offers a more comfortable and quite ride than its competitors and priced closer to smaller models (A4, 3 series, c300) than the larger models (A6, 5 Series, RL), which it more closely competes. I think the upgrades with the executive package are well worth it. Gas mileage is average, but able to use regular grade gasoline and still in ""break-in"" period. Scheduled maintenance is included. Great value and safety. Very underrated car. Recommend without reservation."
volvo,s80,2009,4ron, 04/16/2018,A Down to Basics Luxury Sedan,5,"The Volvo S80 is one of the industry's best kept secrets. While not flashy or grabbing headlines it provides dependable, comfortable transportation. Handing is accurate and secure while the ride can be a bit stiff on rough roads but by and large is very comfortable. Best of all we have not had one problem with this car, now at 75,000 miles. I can see why owners keep them for so long. Ours is going on 11 years and feels and looks like new! One other point of mention: the seats are the best in the business. We might keep it another 5 years.

I like Volvos for the obvious reasons, but this car is fun to drive and very comfortable, but has excellent handling.  This car is a great combination of function and fun.  This car is the 3.2, but it runs great and has great performance even on regular gas.  The mileage is at least good for a car this size.  The traction control is fantastic and really don't see the need for AWD.  I live outside of Boston, so we get a fair amount of snow and have been great in the snow and ice.  This is a great family car."

The car drives much better than I thought over windy roads, especially using the flawless Geartronic transmission aggressively. DTSC keeps the car tight to the road and comfort level is awesome. I had compared the S80 to Audi A4 Prestige model and it was less expensive. Audi A6 is actually the comparable car but way more expensive! Control panel with buttons is more intuitive than the I- drive on German sedans. MPG is as advertized--23 MPG pure highway and 17- 19 mixed depending on driving conditions. "

I saw all the rebates Volvo had on this car and was able to knock $10k total off MSRP through negotiating with the dealership.  So my $42k was purchased for $32k, which is an incredible value.  The car drives very well, seats are very supportive and comfortable.  All of the materials in the car are high quality.  In addition, the 5 yr 60k warranty, which includes maintenance and wear/tear items made this decision very easy for me.

It makes me want to run from the cops when they try to pull me over for speeding."

I purchased one 3 months later.
I had wanted the V8, but they were in short supply and being discontinued.

I have the sport suspension and most bells and whistles.
Most comfortable seats I have ever sat in.
All my passengers comment on the comfort, ride and appearance of the car.
Great simple design cabin with easy controls.

many others, I like being different."

The ride rivals my old Mercedes 420SEL.  Massaging seats a nice bonus.  Awesome power, good enough handling, and hours of comfort on 5 hour drives every weekend.  I have a bad back, and BMW/Audi/Mercedes are too stiff.  Cadillac/Lincoln are to ""glitzy"". Love the understated beauty of the car. Most comfortable seats in the world.  "

I get quite a few thumbs up when I drive and quite a few smug looks from Mercedes drivers. The interior leather is beige leather with coffee dash which is a beautiful combination. The 650W Stereo is just as good as my home Bose system.  It's well balanced with the help of an equalizer.  I love the engine when it first fires up as it growls then settles down where it's Quiet!"

The overall build quality is superb,the standard equipment is mind boggling, leather is standard, not so with mb/audi/bmw! Hd radio and bluetooth! Oh and did I mention the seats, the most comfortable seats period! It is a fun car to drive, Volvo tweaked the shift points and our 3.2 pzev flies, great ride not as punishing as our 04 V-70.

volvo,s80,2010,Chicago T6, 03/24/2010,2010 T6 is a real sleeper - drive one!,4,"Considered all the usual suspects from BMW, MB, Lexus, and Audi, and liked the S80 T6 more than any of them. It has a couple quirks, but doesn't every car? The I6 turbo is very responsive, makes great noises and is super smooth - much more so than the competitors' V6 engines, and on par with the turbo I6 from BMW. I have the dynamic package which really creates a great handler, without undue harshness, and it really does look more stylish and aggressive with the lowered suspension and package specific wheels. Great car!"

Let's just say when it comes to speed, it leaves much to desire. I miss that PUNCH when I floor it. The dealer warned me it wasn't as fast as what I was used to driving, but got a great deal. Dealer said car had 235 hp which is okay with me i guess. The car is elegant on the outside as it is inside. The design is signature Volvo with a slight modern flair that makes people look twice. the enlarged name and logo really make a statement too. handles well, but not impressed. comfort is unrivaled! quiet engine.

Much improved over the S60 in terms of build quality, and materials.  Only complaints are the engine noise at cruising speeds, seems intrusive for a car that costs this much.  I drove Audi, Volkswagen, and Lexus and and went with Volvo for the price.  I am happy with the choice.  "
volvo,s80,2011,MrSmith, 10/09/2010,"Comfortable, Safe Cruiser",4,"The S80 is best cruising on the highway.  It is not a nimble car. The exterior design is traditional Volvo.  T6 performance is more than adequate.  Fuel Economy is fine. The interior design and quality is better than US/Japan, but not quite up to Mercedes/Audi standards.  This car is 90% Mercedes at 80% of the price.  The technology and safety offerings are stunning and they work very well.  I recommend this car to anyone looking for understated luxury and high quality."
volvo,s80,2011,son_of_norway, 11/08/2011,Best Bang For The Buck,4,"I chose the Volvo S80 as I wanted a safe vehicle, with good styling, and performance. The features I had included were the blind spot information system, climate package, and parking assist. Having driven other ""performance"" cars the base 3.2 is more than enough. If you do live in a mountain region with snow consider the T6 as the front wheels do spin even with the DTSC system.
The interior on the S80 puts the competition to shame as it is true wood and designed with incredible detail.

I test drove the BMW 328, BMW 335, Acura TL for reference.
After my previous experience I wouldn't recommend an Audi as even up to the model I recently owned they have many electrical problems. "

volvo,s80,2012,Stephen, 01/31/2017,"S80 Volvo with brawn, but less brain.",3,"Performance and general interior and exterior styling are good.  The seats are very comfortable, and fuel economy is reasonable for this class of car.  For some odd reason you have to pull twice on the door handle to get the door to open.  The first pull to unlock, and the second to actually open the door.  Adaptive cruise control is my favorite tech feature, although if you come to a complete stop it disengages after a couple of seconds.  Being a tech nut, my experience with the infotainment system, including navigation, has been a huge let down.  Few road labels on moving map.  Inputs not intuitive.  No touch screen, so controls are clunky.  Menus for settings etc, were hard even for the sales reps and service people to figure out.  Voice commands are slow and plodding.  After fresh navigation update the new database installed still had incorrect information on road accessibility.  Even major freeway intersections were incorrectly configured on the map.  Now get this, navigation updates have to be done with car running, and at a stop, and it takes several hours to do it, seriously.  Also, if you turn off your engine and want to listen to music the car’s infotainment system will turn off after a few minutes, even though the energy required to listen to music is relatively small.  Smart phone connectivity is unreliable.  So for a car that claims to be tech savvy by those that represent it, I was very disappointed to find out how backward the infotainment system actually is.  Which is a shame seeing as how the rest of the car is pretty good.

volvo,s80,2012,CBatt, 12/01/2016,Newer Is Not Better.,4,This is my fifth Volvo and third S80.   Over the years the quality of the materials has deteriorated.  In my opinion the best of the S80 cars was the 2004 2.5t AWD.   After a few years the SIMULATED metal and wood on the shifting console has started to come off and bubble.  On uneven surfaces the  car is difficult to maintain a straight line.  The steering also pulses when making turns.  Overall I like the ride an comfort but if this is what the future holds for Volvo it will be my last one.

"
volvo,s80,2015,Joel H, 07/09/2015,Wasn't sure about this car at first...,5,".., but I LOVE it & so does everyone else.  The S80 e-Drive Platinum 2015.5 is under-marketed and you likely aren't chomping at the bit to buy one.  Do not make the mistake of believing what is said about the performance of the professional reviewer even if you are an aggressive driver.   I wanted a car that met the following criteria:  going to be around for 10 years, protect me from the bad drivers on the road today, deliver zippy performance,  provide efficient gas mileage and be comfortable and fun to drive.  I am so glad i got in the S80 at the dealer.  I almost got the S60 but decided the 80 was larger and a better fit for me since i'm 6'2 and over 200.  My son is already 6' at age 14 so space would have been tight for the family in the S60.  

I looked at lots of cars and realized i'm not the guy for those that look pompous.  I wanted understated, classy, strong value and safe.   I've got 10k on this now and not one thing has caused me an issue other than figuring out how to setup my Volvo connection account.  Their customer service solved the problem very quickly.   Everyone that rides in it is amazed and says things like ""well, I never"" and ""beautiful"" and ""what kind of car is this again?"".    The technology is significantly advanced over the 2015.   

I would purchase it again in a heartbeat.   Two complaints.  First, there is no defined place for sunglasses and they go into a compartment behind the radio or the central bin between the seats.  The compartment behind the radio is most convenient but they fly out when you swing around a sharp corner fast.  I do that a lot.  Second, the cup holders for the front seat are too close together.  As a result, my venti iced latte and my wife's drink like to pop the lid off one another.  

Take one for a nice long drive and see if you can return it to the lot.  I could not and look forward to handing this off to my oldest when she graduates college in 7 years.
"
volvo,s80,2015,Kevin NC, 09/15/2015,Awesome car - Technology needs improvement,4,"Joel H's review was spot on. The 2015.5 Platinum Drive-E is awesome. The gas mileage is impressive - I got as much as 38.5 mpg on the highway. City mileage generally is not near the EPA estimate of 25 - more like 19.  It is a very understated car - most people do not realize what an exceptional car it is - great ride and comfort. The folding rear seats give you additional room when you need to move something. The headlights are absolutely awesome! - They are very bright and turn as you turn the vehicle. I can attest to the fact that it is a safe car. I was in a major accident and my S80 was totaled (not my fault - another guy ran a red light). It did exactly what it was supposed to do - side curtain airbags deployed but the front ones did not (since by then my speed was reduced when I hit a pole). I am glad the front air bags did not go off when they did not have to - my head never hit the steering wheel. Even though the front-end of the car sustained substantial damage, the air bags did not go off when they didn't need to. 

My only major complaint about the car was the Volvo On Call App. It was one of the main reasons I bought the car - ability to remote start, send destinations from smart phone to GPS, etc. But the connectivity and Volvo support was not very good. Even though reliability was only around 60-70%, I needed it for the remote start. Prior to the accident I renewed my Volvo On Call for 54 months. I paid $600 for 54 months. After the accident, I realized I had 48 months left on the service that I would not be able to use. I called Volvo to get a refund of the remaining time since I obviously would not be able to use the service since the car was totaled. Volvo said too bad - we have your $600 and are going to keep it even though we know we can't provide you the service.  So as a word of CAUTION, it may be tempting to renew for a longer period of time because $11.11 per month (for 54 months) is more reasonable than $16.67 per month (1 year renewal). However, if anything happens to your car, you could be out a lot of money. It basically cost me $100 per month for the service (used 6 of the 54 months). Not worth $16.67 per month for the service and absolutely not worth $100 per month!! Also, as I understand it, if you sell the car, it is not transferable and the new owner will have to buy the same service again. So not good if you think you might sell the car. Just something to consider should you decide to renew. I was extremely disappointed in Volvo's response to my request for a refund. I will never ever make that mistake again! I have another car (different manufacturer) with a similar app and it is substantially more reliable and substantially less expensive. So I know there are manufacturers out there that have Apps that work well.

volvo,s80,2016,J Hopper, 06/30/2016,Just What I Wanted!,5,"I transitioned from a 2015 Volvo XC60 to this 2016 Volvo S80 Sedan and I'm so glad I did.  Almost the same engine as the XC60 (except no supercharger - just the turbocharger) - but the S80 seems lighter and faster.  I really enjoy the quiet cabin and the way the controls are laid out.   There is a smallish-7 inch screen in the center of the dash for Navigation which is good - not distracting, just helpful.   The Bluetooth works great - the stereo sounds wonderful.  Nice, smooth drive and although others have said this is a 'boring car' - I find it just a pleasure to drive.   No drama - just a well thought out, luxury car.  And - at least 10-15K less expensive than a comparable BMW or MBZ.   The best 5 star crash safety ratings too! The only 'minor' issue is that I know these cars lose value quickly - which makes them an absolute STEAL of a used car.  I plan to keep this car for at least 5 years so no worries about that for me.

volvo,s80,2016,Maxwell, 12/10/2016,Great Highway Cruiser,5,"I bought this car used as a certified vehicle from a Volvo dealer. I am a heavy interstate highway traveler and I put approximately 40,000 miles per year on a car. I have owned Chevrolet, Acura, BMW, VW, Ford, Honda, Toyota, and Lexus vehicles over the past 20 years and have used all in the course of my business. I was attracted to the 2016 Volvo S80 due to its extensive safety features, however, I can honestly say that it is the best highway car I have ever owned. Specifically, it tracks down the road like it is on rails, it has the most comfortable front seat I have ever sat in (still comfortable after a all day 8-hour drive), and it gets good gas mileage (about 35 to 37 miles per gallon when traveling on the interstate at 65 to 75 mph).  The adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning systems are also extremely useful highway features for me. The adaptive dual xenon headlights are the best I have every experienced for nighttime driving. To say that I am pleased with this car would be a gross understatement and I would highly recommend it.

volvo,s80,2016,SF, 09/23/2016,Great car...Would not hesitate buying another one!,5,"After getting in a pretty bad accident in my 2013 S-80 (where it was totaled) there was no question that I was going to buy another S-80.  Couldn't believe how that car protected me during the accident but then again it is a Volvo.  Although I thought I would really miss not having the T6 AWD engine, I feel the T5 is actually quicker with the turbo.  In addition to the inscription I also have the technology package which is incredible.   I was able to get one of the last 2016 models my dealer had and since the S90's were out was able to get it for below the Edmunds TMV.  There is nothing I dislike about this car.   As a side, would strongly recommend that you consider the overseas delivery if you have the time.  I have done it several times in the past and would have done it again had it not been for the fact that I needed a car right away.  It is fun, very easy and a great experience.

The volvo dealer had an s80 program car with 11k on it and a CPO warranty for 89k and up to 6 yrs that they wanted to sell. They gave me a good value on the trade and the s80 was discounted heavily. The suby had a good ride, but a little too much road noise. The volvo has less road noise and a little less body roll in turns. I miss the all wheel drive and the eyesight system of the Suby. We haven,t any snow so I can,t compare, but the Suby was great in bad weather. The volvo is only front wheel drive. The volvo does have comfortable seats. I averaged 24 with the suby 6, so far i,m only gettin 25 in the s80 in mixed driving.  Maybe I need to give this more time , I,ll update in 6 months.

volvo,v40,2000,Scott Mathews, 07/20/2005,Better than you think,4,"This is possibly the best Volvo I've ever owned. Quick, comfortable, and stylish and only minor problems. Many of the issues that others have reported suggest to me that they never opened the owner's manual. Example: ""headlights burn out annually"". The cars come from the factory with Daytime Running Lights (DRL) activated. Naturally the headlights are going to burn out more often when they're on day and night. Solution: read the owner's manual and it tells you how to turn DRL off in 2 easy steps. Some other problems may have been caused by not following Volvo's recommended service intervals. I would like to know more about the driving style of folks who wore out their brakes in 15,000 miles!"
volvo,v40,2000,JOrange, 09/02/2005,Great car with a few faults.,4,"Our v40 now has 65,000 miles on it. The headlights do burn out about once a year as they are always running. Small price to pay for the increased saftey. The car is fun to drive, quite fast, TONS of room and built like a tank. If safety is a concern this is a good car."
volvo,v40,2000,mhl, 01/16/2003,Better Coffee in the Service Department,4,"Headlights burn out annually. Rear 
wheel alignment was needed to stop tire 
burn.  Original equipment tire model 
not stocked locally, had to special 
order from TX, twice (replaced all 4 at 
19,000 mi).
Turbo exhaust seal started leaking at 
25,000.  Leather steering wheel melted 
and had to be replaced.   Steering 
wheel squeak required replacement of 
steering rack.  Low hum vibration when 
stopped in gear (suspect motor mount?). 
Brake service frequent, but this is to 
be expected with Volvo's.
All this sounds bad, however dealer and 
factory have been generally great in 
standing behind their product."
volvo,v40,2000,Not Gonna Again, 12/22/2002,Need Better Coffee At the Repairshop,3,"Brakes done X4, and the brake warning 
light is on AGAIN!  You can bet the 
headlight bulbs will burn out in 12 
months (each side exactly 30 days 
apart).  Motormount vibration at 
idle/stop is excessive.  Turbo gasket 
is leaking. Finish is wearing off the 
steering wheel.

Overall, the car drives well, and is 
good on gas when on highway; not so 
good in town. Brake and tires have been 
disappointing.  A bit small inside.  
The price for a Volvo was attractive, 
but the downtime for repairs has been 
unacceptable.  Back to Lexus for the 
next one."

volvo,v40,2001,Tooth E. Grin, 12/27/2015,Oil City,2,"After only four months of ownership my V40 started leaking oil.  I got estimates ranging from $950 to $1,700 basically, to replace all seals because nobody was really certain as to where the oil was coming from.  It was not a good situation because the oil was dangerously close to the timing belt.  It wasn't a bad leak:  probably a quart every 7,500 miles.  I checked the belt periodically (it was changed around 90,000) and it always looked dry.  After three years, the belt slipped.  Luckily, it didn't damage the cylinders (it ran for only about three seconds while in my garage-----luckily, I wasn't doing 70 mph out on the highway!).  Since then I've encountered a myriad of problems.  Most recently, the #1 cylinder started missing and need a new ignition coil.  Then, it would just refuse to start (had to be put into neutral----------'never did this before!!).  I drive a lot.  And I work sometimes over 100 miles from home.  This was a great car, but I've lost my confidence in it.

drove from TEXAS to NYC. 1800 miles in 
2 days that's 30 hours not incld stops 
for food, the toilet and gas. No 
problem for me, but the car? The V40 
great. Smooth ride on the freeway, 
sport like on the city interchanges 
and streets. Stopped 7 times, 55 
gallons of gas and actually drove 
1900.2 miles. I avg 70 mph and 34.6

volvo,v40,2001,Diren Yardimli, 04/11/2009,A sexy highway cruiser,4,"The V40 is not the station we have come to expect from Volvo. It's neither as masculin nor as bricky as a conventional Volvo (which made me think twice before buying it). Yet the design is slim, clean and as sexy as can be for a station wagon. Its seats embraces you, its steering is solid and secure, its engine sounds confident. Neither the sporthy whiiim, not the cheap sound of most commercial engines.  On the road it easily glides through the traffic, easily reaches 200 km/h (even though the official max. speed is 195 for the 1.8).  "
volvo,v40,2001,Volvo convert, 06/12/2007,2001 Volvo V40,4,"My Corolla was totaled while parked on the street (who could have foreseen that?!), so in replacing it I was thinking safety, which the V40 has in droves (save for stability control, which was reserved for $40K cars in 2001). The V40 has turned out to be an ideal compromise between all the things I want in a car. While it doesn't excel in any one category (except for safety and comfort, Volvo's trademarks), the V40 does everything pretty darn well! You don't have to trade efficiency for performance, you get both at above average levels. Same for size vs. cargo space, handling vs. ride; all the places where you expect to give up one thing to get another. Handles everything you throw at it."
volvo,v40,2001,Joey, 12/11/2008,Great Long-Term Value,4,"Purchased used at a great value and haven't been disappointed, yet. Other than regular maintenance, the car has performed great. It's sporty, holds bikes and snowboards on top, enough room for moderate luggage load in the rear - if not a bit tight in the rear seats, though. Comfortable ride, but not the best on long trips. Austere interior is perfect - I prefer minimal and simple interior gadgets/knobs. Misses would include black bumper trim pieces fading and the replacement of the fascia cup holder which I completed myself. I've also replaced the front strut mounts 3 times due to potholes and rough roads. The turbo is quick and a great asset for both city and motorway take-overs."
volvo,v40,2001,drivetotheend, 07/13/2007,Nice lil wagon,4,"Bought with 58,000, now at 74,000. Nothing beyond the 60K service and oil changes. Paint is worst feature. Added mud flaps and euro-rails for a little character and sport exhaust, K&N filter, Bilstein gas shocks and a heavier sway bar for fun. Very responsive, very quick, very nice. As noted on these, the brakes will need replacing after about 20K, but it still stops well (they were new at purchase). Overall, this is a great vehicle. Yakima box onto the rails and I can fit all I need to camp with my wife and two small children. Once they get a little older, the back seat will be too small; it's tight back there!"

Noticeable interior creaks and squeaks recently but nothing the stock sound system can handle. My V40 is my office and it still handles great. My only complaint is the cost of servicing this vehicle. Without doubt the most expensive car I have ever owned for regular maintenance. Beware."
volvo,v40,2001,California, 08/01/2019,Safe in some ways BUT NOT IN OTHERS!,2,"I, like many others was under the impression that Volvo is a very safe car. While I was getting a tune up the mechanic informs me, "" Did you know....that this particular Volvo is notorious for catching on fire?"" My immediate reaction was shock filled with intense fear! He said that it is the only model (I believe, could be others too) that was designed with the manifold sitting right above the exhaust so any drip of oil, which mine has quite a few little ones,  can potentially set my car on fire!  I was so scared to even drive it a block! The thought of being burned alive is a paranoia I have to deal with every time I drive and I smell a strong smell of gasoline or some other burning chemical! NOT SO SAFE AFTER ALL! And finding the parts I've needed are near impossible... My ignition coil 'connectors' were totally melted and were only sold attached to a much larger and super expensive part that I didn't even need. So I went to Pic A Part and got them , used, off a torn up vehicle. And my check engine light had been on for the full 4 years I've owned it. Also the tail light housings crumbled in my hand when I went to replace the bulb. They don't sell those anywhere at all, same thing, I got them at a junk yard.

safety, but what about reliability, comfort and that fun factor?  We're thrilled 
to say we found them all in our V40.  It's so solid, you feel like you're in a

(steering). The prev. owner had 
replaced the rear rotors
(again..warrenty item)IMO, The v40 has 
good initial acceleration due the 
minimal turbo lag and the ride quality 
is great. I wish the car came w/a 
strut tower and 15/16in rims because 
taking on windy roads can get a bit 
scary. Rear seat room is tight(made

Handles well and was my 50 miles a day commuter averaging 26 mpg mixed driving. Expensive to service but there were no major problems in 8 years. Burns through headlights and bulbs. Don't know why. All over the internet but dealers claim ignorance. My 16 year old just inherited it. Safe, runs great, expect another few good years from it. Over all a good purchase new, and if taken care of, worth the blue book value used. Maybe even undervalued in blue book if clean and taken care of. Just keep after those damn bulb changes. "

As noted, I bought the car two years ago. I haven't replaced a headlight yet. The windshield does need to be replaced, but living in Wyoming means high winds and sanded roads will affect a windshield negatively.  I wish the fuel economy were better, but who doesn't? The cargo room is just about perfect.  The seats are comfortable, and the ride is very quiet. (Perhaps it's my tires.) In fact, given the choice between taking our newer Subaru or the Volvo on a 2,000 mile round trip road trip, we decided on the Volvo. This won't be my last Volvo!"

Third, this car was gas-efficient and capable of carrying a number of dogs, cargo, and other assorted living/inert objects with grace.  Fourth, it was comfortable.  You sank into the seats, not on top of them. A million organized cubbyholes for all your junk are provided.  It's a nice, sane, well- planned ride.  Great visibility.  I hope you enjoy it.  "

So the power and acceleration improve with age! Too bad I am returning it.Volvo has got to do something to compensate owners for the poor brake pad wear, they won't admit that there is a problem.The OEM Continental tires would not stay inflated properly.Also had 2 flats.Upgrade to Michelins required tires rated to 150 mph!

volvo,v40,2002,thirtysomething, 01/30/2007,Practical and Economical while still Fun,3,"I bought this car because it was reasonably priced and the because of Volvo's reputation.  It is a bit on the small side if you have more than one child or move lots of stuff, but it a very practical car that holds quite a bit with the rear seats completely flat.  The acceleration is surprisingly quick for a 4 cyl.  It is better than many V6 I have driven. The handling is tight enough for a sports wagon but I wouldn't go searching for curves.  Fantastic mileage!  This is what is keeping me from upgrading to a bigger or more powerful car or hybrid. 28 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on the highway.  I've had zero maintenance issues in 5 years.  Change your oil!"

volvo,v40,2002,Anna, 04/08/2008,The Best!,4,"I bought this car overseas with American specs. I drove it three times round trip to Italy and back to Brussels, Belgium (over 20 hours drive) and never had a problem. It spacious, reliable and looks great. I do keep it up. I take it only to Volvo for any required check up or parts. The headlights I only had to change them twice but this is normal for any car. I had little problem with the check engine light but it got resolved. Great car and I would buy it again. Rule of thumb: Take it only to Volvo for any problems and you will never have to complain about it. "

Car has plenty of zip and handles well. Both my wife and I find the seats comfortable.  The lumbar support helps. A/C blows cold and have had no work other than regular maintenance done on it. Would recommend as used car."
volvo,v40,2003,Adam Lausch, 05/21/2010,Why Europeans tend to get it right,4,"I must say that this is truly a unique car. I've rated it as unbiased as tough as I can. I simply love to drive it, and I've owned some pretty nice vehicles. I think one of its major downfalls is that Volvo didn't offer a manual transmission, that would be a blast. I love the V50s, but we were able to find a very nice V40 with low miles for $6K. I couldn't pass it up. So far I've have the check engine light come on once, and I think the ignition timing may have been off a bit. So I changed out a set of new high-performance plugs, and it's running superbly. Good performance, not great. It's so comfortable as well. Why buy a SUV for a small family when there are fun and economic wagons like this"

about it!  The interior is well-
designed, spacious, and fits like a 
glove.  The exterior is classy and very 
cool.  Plus- add the eurorails & fog

little bit slow to start off with- but 
once it passes the 30 MPH mark- you are 
flyin'!  So far- so good!"

not.  We chose this primarily because 
of the Volvo name and safety features.  
The price as also competitive.  We live 
in the city so we V70 would have been 
too big.  This car is somewhat too 
small, particularly in cargo area and 
backseat when compared to its 
competitors.  He drives and handles 
well and is pretty zippy on the 
freeway.  Gas mileage for city driving 
is surprisingly poor for a 4 cyl. car 
(15 mpg).  Requires premium gas too!"
volvo,v40,2003,bigalexk, 11/25/2008,From Volvo patriot to to Volvo hostage,2,The car was a subject of three repairs by warranty including one when I stuck in the road and the car was towed to an auto repair shop. After the warranty the owning of the car has turned into financial disaster. The car is purposely design to exclude or hinder repair by the owner. Now my car is 6 years old having 73000 miles on odometer and it has serious transmission problem. The repair costs so much that I cannot afford it. The car is filled with manufacturing defects and bad design solutions. While it was in repairs and I had chance driving S40 and V50. I found them even worse. What a big mistake I made when I got into this Volvo bondage!
volvo,v40,2003,Jackpot, 10/31/2002,Surprisingly competitive,4,"Light, narrow and quick (once you get 
past the turbo lag).  Excellent for the 
price, more fun and nicer than a 
Subaru, etc.  Performs comparably to 
the BMW 3-series wagon, the MB C-class 
wagon, or the Audi A4 series for much 
less $.  Handles well on snow."

boring cars.  I was really suprised

once we saw it.  The fit and finish is 
really very good as is the power and 
space and especially the safety and 
security features. if Volvo is aiming 
this car towards the younger generation

right track."

weight in the country roads"
volvo,v40,2003,jseattle, 12/13/2002,V40 vs. Passat,5,"We purcahsed the V40 over the Passat 
for three reasons:  1) no turbo lag in 
the V40 compared with noticable lag and 
kick in the Passat; 2) better exterior 
styling in the wagon configuration; and 
3) better interior trim finishes-dash 
and leather feel.  The engine feels 
like a V6 and is w/o noticible turbo 
lag and accleration wheel pull on the 
front wheel drive.  Both we felt could 
have been better on the Passat we test 
drove."

2003 V40 a few days ago after doing 
extensive online research of smaller, 
upscale wagons. Feature wise (on 
paper), the V40 is by far the best 
value going vs. other upscale smaller 
wagons, such as the BMW 3-series and 
Audi A4A Avant. After our first 
hundred miles or so driving the car, 
it's clear this car doesn't miss a 
step vs. the competition. Especially 
with the current incentives. It's 
almost too good to be true."
volvo,v40,2003,Solo, 03/04/2003,V40: What a nice surprise!!!,4,"I chose it over the VW Jetta and Passat 
wagons based on price and performance, 
V40's are absolutely a better value in 
Puerto Rico because VW's are overpriced.
The exterior design is simple, but 
refined and tasteful.  Interior design 
looks and feels expensive and well-
finished.  Excellent very supportive 
front seats.  There is limited space on 
the rear seat, but it is roomy and 
comfortable enough for children and 
average adults.  Acceleration and 
braking are more than adequate for 
daily commuting and will even allow 
some fun on twisty roads and long 
stretches.  It cost only $26k, but 
every friends and aquaintances
guess has been from $38k to $50k."

I was surprised to discover the stylish 
v40 among the usual Volvo boxes. We 
drove it, liked it and bought one. The 
incentives on this car make it very 
appealing, especially considering next 
year's replacement looks too much like 
another VW. The more we drive it, the 
more we like it."
volvo,v40,2003,Patwest, 07/26/2004,v-40,5,"It is almost as heavy as my old '95 
850T (which had 210000 on it). Handles 
like a larger car. It has a lot of zip 
with the turbo engine.  It U-turns in 3 
lanes.

Plenty of room for a bike, wheelchair, 
or lots of luggage.

some compact wagons."

provided utility for a small family.  
We found it in the V40.  I was suprised

work through the perilous Atlanta

the wagons and felt this was our best 
option."

soccer mom like the larger wagons.  My 
V40 is fully loaded and everyone always

Its a Volvo, it has it's demons, the dealership is the greatest of those demons, avoid going there at all costs.  Find a good independent Volvo garage.  I love this car, for the price I paid, and the miles put on it.  That would not be the case if I had to bring it to a garage.  Over the 5 years I have owned it I have replaced the brake pads, rotors, plugs, battery, front and rear struts, tie rods, tires, transmission, front speakers, various dashboard lights (now it's like new!).  The check engine light is always on (catylitic converter). I live with it.  This car is great on the highway (29 mpg). It prefers Premium gasoline. Leather seats and interior is very comfy (for a single guy) if you drive a lot... and you can fit 5 2x4x10's inside with practice.   This model year (2001-2004) is known for weak transmissions (2001-2002 especially) (I blew my transmission towing a heavy load - not the cars falt), a poor steering rack (you have to remove the engine to replace it) and vacuum leaks that can drive you nuts.   I live in new England and this is the first car I have owned with this many miles with NO RUST.  I think the poor transmission is why there are so few of these on the road in the states - the cost to replace is the replacement cost at this point.  I am looking for another used one, 2004 if possible with low miles-at 1.8 cents per mile for my purchase price its a great value.

this pure winner in 2005.  We went
shopping for a Mini or something similar
to offset the gas guzzling mileage of
our SUVs and found this V40 wagon small
enough, wonderfully fuel efficient
(occasionally averaging 30 mpgs for a
tankful), with quality fit and finish
and ever so much more practical than
compact sedans.  It is  responsive in
every way, has been great in the snow,
and is fun to drive.  It is the perfect
car for an empty nest couple who still
need to move things from place to place

For the first 2000 miles drive, the car was 15 days in the dealership service bay. Then, the best feature of its turbo was not set right. The dash lights keep coming up every now and then without any pattern. Still not fully 'exorcised' and the warranty is over. I will probably never buy a Volvo again, safety or no safety!  If your car transmission dies suddenly on a freeway, I don't know how you call it safe or reliable. But only one thing I like about it, the peppy turbo charged engine. Muscle car drivers hate its guts!"
volvo,v40,2004,logiclane, 07/26/2005,Transmission issue,4,"I have 37,000 miles on mine, and it has been a great car for highway travel. I too have had the transmission hangup issue, which the dealer was able to diagnose and replace the shift control unit under warranty.

We also wanted a car that was flexible enough to be both our family car, but also a respectable car to be driven for my consulting work. The V40 fit the bill. I have to drive both short distances in city traffic as well as long distances on highways and the V40 handles both nicely. Four years later I still love my car. I would buy another."

my needs of hauling family and

an SUV and most of all; it is a very 
SAFE car.  I like the quality of fit 
and finish of my Audi A4 better but I 
would say I get more value on the V40

We need a spacious and reliable car.  The first 2 years were ok.  The last 2 years have been a headache. The car is in the shop every month! The electronic system is always failing, with all kinds all scary warning signs: Engine Failure, Break Failure, Transmissions failure!  This week was the worst. The immobilizer warning comes on and the key is stuck at position 1. Had to get it towed to the shop.  Volvo has not been able to fix the problem after so many software upgrades. If you do not want to find yourself stranded 200 miles away from home, do not buy this car"
volvo,v50,2005,Beachyy, 08/02/2010,Review,4,We had trouble with the car starting.  It would say invalid key and left us stranded twice.  They replaced to started and it was fixed under warranty.  We also had trouble with fuses blowing and sometimes the windows not going up or down.  They replaced the whole electrical system for us under warranty. 
volvo,v50,2005,sue, 02/04/2008,"Electronic Problems, costly maintenance",3,"I like driving the V50.  The problem with it is the electronices.  Had to have the air worked on twice under warranty thank God.  The home link, the air conditioning, radio and the cruise control have all needed computer updates.  I'm afraid of what will happen when it goes off warranty. Less than 5,000 miles left.  I was also told that Volvo doesn't offer extended warranties.  I would have to buy one of the after market warranties. The cost of regular maintenance is high.  The maintenance today costs me over $500.  That was an oil change, cabin filter change, coolant flush and front brake pads."

Two sets of tire by 45000 @ $200/tire. Cd player has been replaced.Fuel line has been replaced.Rear wiper has fallen off.Should I expect more for a car in the $30+K range.Volvo customer care is a joke.They do not care.""On Call"" operators never told me about trip interruption insurance (I've talked to about 6 of them). I received the info form a dealer.If this is any indication of Volvo quality-forget it. I cannot wait to rid myself of this car. This is the worst car purchase of my life."
volvo,v50,2005,PBW, 01/15/2010,Don't Purchase - Look at Competition,3,Wife's car.  Bought to replace V40.  OK power. Expensive maintenance after warranty.  Inside cramped for adults.  Better cars out there unless you are looking for the Volvo brand and think it is still the safest - which it is not- good marketing campaign...
volvo,v50,2005,misliss, 10/17/2008,"Pretty good, but not great.",4,"I am on my second V50. The first I had for a month, and it was in the shop 3 weeks of that month. After much complaining, I got Volvo to give me a new one, with more features. I have leased my car for 3 years and am about to buy it. It works pretty well for my life as a busy mom of one. But, the sunroof leaks, the interior lights sometimes work, and I have gone through more tires than I would like to admit. The car gets great gas mileage, drives nicely, has enough zip to keep me going, and is great on turns."
volvo,v50,2005,kermit, 10/23/2008,Fun to drive family car,4,"We bought our V50 wagon because we had a baby on the way.  It was by far the best looking in it class. We've had some minor issues. The visor mirror lights stopped working, but the dealership fixed it without complaint. My biggest gripe has been that it goes through breaks and tires fast. The brakes needed replaced at 25k and the tires will need replaced before 40k.  The car also has a tendency to look the saved seat settings. It can take or day or two to get it right again. Overall, the car has been great though. I would definitely buy one again."
volvo,v50,2005,Former Volvo Lover, 12/29/2008,A Shop Queen,3,"The car goes into the shop multiple times a year for warranty repairs. Lately, it has been in the shop more than I've been able to drive it. Some of the many issues include a major fuel leak warning, a sunroof drain  routed to the drivers feet(and resulting flood), broken keys (they actually broke apart), air conditioning which suddenly spews hot air and then suddenly goes back to cold air (only on one side), broken sunroof motor, squeaky brakes (even new), broken antenna in the steering wheel which disables your key and strands you with no way to turn your car on (subsequent tow (by Volvo) resulting in a punctured oil pan and finger pointing by the Volvo Customer Service and Service Reps)."
volvo,v50,2005,PD, 05/27/2010,It has served me well.,4,"I have driven the car 58,000 miles now. Initially, I did have a cold start issue when new. But since that problem was fixed in the 1st year (software update), the car has worked perfectly for me.  I own the turbo (T5 AWD) and it is a blast to drive. Handling is superb. Great acceleration and pick-up.  I opted for the upgraded stereo which is truly spectacular - great crisp highs and deep lows. Edmunds also rated it very highly.  Car/road/wind noise suppression is good. But higher end luxury cars will do better."
volvo,v50,2005,jo & sue, 02/17/2005,R VOLVO,4,"WE always wanted a Volvo and now we have the 2005 V50T5 sports wagon.  We are enjoying the ride and comfort.  We live in Germany and with the snow on the roads it is nice to have ""W"" for road conditions.  The only thing we don't like is the front cup holders.  "
volvo,v50,2005,Sally, 12/16/2008,Too many problems.,3,"Our V50 has been in the shop a lot. Problems with the radio, the auto rear view mirror, the alignment, the radio, the outside temp indicator, engine cutting out. Can't remember how many computer upgrades have been done. The electronics on this car are terrible. Just got it out of the shop again--engine light on and the engine would cut out. Cost me over $500 to repair--this time it was the fuel pressure sensor which surprise needed to have another computer upgrade. Expensive to repair. "
volvo,v50,2005,jtroop, 11/29/2010,"Loved this car, but it was a lemon",4,"got this car as a Certified Pre-Owned, so I had a bumper-to-bumper warranty, which I used extensively. First to go was the ignition, which went out again later. Next went the radio, which went out again later. Next went the entire electrical system....the entire electrical system!!!! Next was some strange issue with the lug-nuts???? Then the headliner detached from the roof. Then the right side door lock messed up and required a new locking mechanism. Then the alarm started to go off intermittently for no reason. Finally some sensors started to fail and I got rid of it. None of this cost anything to me, but I had to take it into the dealership over and over. Great car but poor quality. "
volvo,v50,2005,john benediktson, 05/03/2016,The one that got away,5,"The T5 engines from Volvo provide amazing acceleration while getting excellent fuel economy; the Volvo commitment to safety continues to be unparalleled.  Handling of the wagons is not quite as crisp as that of their sedans; but it is still very impressive.  This car sold while I was still trying to decide which one to buy; my eventual decision was to buy it but somebody beat me too it; lucky them.
"
volvo,v50,2005,papalo, 07/15/2006,Fun to drive but SMALL!,3,"OK, we knew that this was a small wagon going into our purchase, but, man, is it cramped!  If you need more cargo space than a sedan but not as much as an SUV, this would be a fun (and functonal) vehicle to drive.  But, with two toddlers (and all the stuff that goes with them), it is just smaller than we were thinking it would be.  Plus, maintenance and repair on this vehicle is astronomical. ($200 to replace ONE tire!)  We've had some reliability issues with the electrical system as well.  We're already looking to trade it in for something else..."
volvo,v50,2005,Ozgur, 02/16/2005,The most beautiful SW on the Road,5,"I believe Volvo is the best value car on the market. If you compare features and prices with the other car companies (Like BMW and Mercedes Benz), Volvo V50 has more features, less price. AWD system is much better than BMW's and Mercedes's AWD system. Heldex differential works very well. Interior design is awesome. Sleek center console is one-of-a-kind. Turbo engine runs smooth and you can feel the power any gear ranges.If you are looking for handsome, reliable and fun to drive family wagon, Volvo is gonna be the best choice."
volvo,v50,2005,dan anderson, 12/07/2004,The 2005 Volvo V50 is a Fin Car,5,"I have a family of four plus two dogs. We are 
stationed in Germany and tour Europe frequently.
So far, this car has been perfect. We can load the 
entire family into it and travel anywhere in comfort 
and with good gas milage.  Gas costs around 1.50
Euro per liter and with 3.8 liters to the gallon you 
need good gas mileage. On the autobahn this car 
gets to 120 MPH with out a problem can go much faster!!!!!
It makes my BMW 525i look stupid on the twists 
and the autobahn. It is a good car i would by and I would
definitely buy another.  "
volvo,v50,2005,BJTerp, 12/19/2004,V50 T5 AWD has been great so far,4,"I traded in my Jeep Liberty for a new 
V50 T5 AWD because I wanted something 
fun to drive.  The Volvo has not 
disappointed.  The performance and 
handling are great for a car in this 
class, and the car feels very solid.  
Compared to the BMW 330xi and Audi A4 
2.8 Avant, the V50 gives you a lot of 
bang for the buck, and better styling.  
The interior is beautiful, and very 
comfortable.  The upgraded stereo 
sounds fantastic, and the 17"" wheels 
give the car an aggressive look."
volvo,v50,2005,KW, 05/19/2005,V50 T5 AWD,4,"Have had my V50 for about 8 months now.  I still love to drive home from work each day.  The engine is responsive, the handling great and feel is solid.  Test drove many other makes (Audi, BMW and VW) and with thier lease options couldn't even come close to the value of the Volvo.  I have most all the options except for the sport package and navigation.  Recommend the upgraded stereo, sounds fantastic.  So far, no complaints just that their is not that much room for storing things. Best of all I feel like I am driving a bank vault!! "
volvo,v50,2005,skier, 04/12/2007,Great Combo!,4,I loved the looks. The combo of turbo performance & mpg are great. The awd is good for handling & good traction in snow. I like the utility of a wagon. I get up to 31 mpg on the highway & 24 mpg around town. The passing power & smooth torque is what is so fun! My T5 has been very reliable.
volvo,v50,2005,dave, 04/06/2007,My experience with the v50 2.4i,4,"I owned a 240 for 16 years.  Liked it, but, not driving in snow.  The v50 has the features I'm interested in: safety, comfortable seats, easy to drive in traffic, easy to park.  The front wheel drive with snow tires have been excellent.  I don't feel that AWD is necessary.  I have been concerned about reliability, but, so far the only problem has been squeaky brakes when backing up.  Problem has been intermittent and dealer has been very supportive.  Problem not totally gone, but, only happens on rare occassions now.  The car has been reliable and it is fun to drive.  I like the car and I intend to keep it."
volvo,v50,2005,Dominicvail, 04/10/2007,Expensive Repairs,3,"We thought we loved the car but it has been one repair after another.  The kicker was that at 2 years old and with 25,000 the clutch burned out.  This repair was not covered by Volvo for warrantee.  My wife and I have always driven manual cars and this is the first clutch issue ever.  It was $2,500 to fix.  We will get rid of the car due to the dissatisfaction we have had with this experience.  We have owned three other Volvos (V-70R AWD and XC-70 AWD) but this one has soured us.  Say good bye to this one."
volvo,v50,2005,PCB, 03/04/2010,Mine's Fine!,4,"I've had my car for 60,000 miles now. It has had one or two minor things go wrong with it (needed new brakes and rotors under warranty), but the dealer has taken care of them.  It is a _gas_ to drive- lots of power, responds well. It is just so much fun. The wagon lets me take my dogs, go to the hardware store, etc.  If you want a car with lots of room, then get a bigger one.. but this is fine for me.  I am still in love with this car-- by far the best I've ever owned.  "
volvo,v50,2005,Peter Tang, 07/08/2004,A great next generation Volvo wagon,4,"Have it for less than 3 weeks and put 
800km on it already.  Very stable on 
highway and could be real fast in 
cornering.  Handling is good too.  
Solid doors and B-pillars (certainly 
with lots of safety features too) make 
you feel safe and confident while 
driving.  A modern and roomy interior 
with ergonomics in mind.  Exterior 
dimension is just right for city 
driving and tight parking space."

great buy."
volvo,v50,2005,firsttimevolvoowner, 12/02/2004,Review of Volvo V50 T5 AWD automatic,4,"Overall, I am pleased with this car and would recommend it to others. However, there are both pros and cons. Let me list them and you can decide for yourself.  

1) The sports-tuned suspension on the T5 AWD is a bit harsh/jarring over bumps. I test drove the FWD version and did not notice this. 

2) mild vibration from passenger side seat over bumps. Not noticed when someone is sitting in the seat. 

3) narrow/deep glove box and small door pockets."
volvo,v50,2005,JP, 01/11/2005,beyond expectations,5,"Volvo was not a contender in our original search for a station wagon. After much research we settled on the A4 wagon, then we went to the SF car show.  A fantastic vehicle that trumps BMW and Audi on all the features that mattered to us; interior space, horsepower (torque lbs), and styling.  Our only hesitation was that it was the first year model, but the $10k we saved convinced us to take the plunge."
volvo,v50,2005,J Patent, 01/29/2005,Great Car,4,"We have put just over 1500 miles on the car and it is great!  We got all the options except the DSC (in hindsight, I would have purchased this) and navigation system.  Used to have an Audi A4 and this car is much better.  The seats are more comfortable, the stereo is better and easier to use, and it performs just as well if not better.  "
volvo,v50,2005,wmsey, 02/02/2005,At 3000 Miles,5,Versatile vehicle with great acceleration and handling with optional DTSC. With nearly 3000 miles overall MPG is 26 with long haul  highway MPG at 70 MPH of 33+. T-tech fabric is  the best non-leather seating material I've used.  Bi-Xenon's are worth every cent. It's my first Volvo  and  has not disappointed in any way. 
volvo,v50,2005,Tom Rasmussen, 02/13/2005,near-volvo,4,"Great car, and was a toss-up between this and XC70. (Other car in garage is XC90.) I like the size, drivability, powertrain, futuristic design. Haldex AWD is second to none. Although drive-feel and braking are excellent, they are not characteristically ""Volvo-like"". A/T does not shift as smooth as other Volvos with Aisin Warner unit, seats do no feel as good as 60, 70, 80 or 90 series. Wish SAT radio was available. Unique key system is over-engineered, and wish european keyless sys was available. Overall, I love this car, very unique, gets many looks and compliments. Next time when lease is up, I'm hoping for and ""R"" version, either V50 or V70."
volvo,v50,2005,floridacar, 02/28/2005,Driving in Mouseland,4," After six months of good experiences with an S40, I bought the V50 as a second car. I wanted something with enough space for the occasional trip to Home Depot, but no ridiculous SUV.  The V50 provides a good combination of style, performance, and room.  I have owned BMW's, Mercedes, and Audis, and the Volvo compares favorably to all.  I opted for the Premium, Sport, and Convenience packages, and the very good auto/manual transmission.  After 1000 miles, mileage is at 27 highway. The ride is as expected: European firm, but not harsh.  There is no noticeable turbo-lag and acceleration is good, but there is some ""rubber-banding"", requiring a little practice for a smooth lift-off."
volvo,v50,2005,keiths66, 05/17/2005,"Great Car, Great Value",4,"I love this car.  Roomier than you would think.  With the Premium Package and Sports Package it is very nicely equipped.  You can feel the quality and saftey features of the car.  Its crisp handling and european ride were exactly what we were looking for.  We replaced an SUV (Land Rover Discovery) and I don't miss it at all, especially the hefty weekly gas bill!"

This car gives me lots of room and sporty so it does not feel like a ""Mom wagon.""  I have the upgrade sound system which I love and the sports package!  It has a smooth drive and comfortable on long trips.  "
volvo,v50,2005,s reich, 11/18/2005,Volvo Sport Wagon,4,"I love this car-- it is fun to drive and is very nimble in traffic.  The sound system, control panel and most of all the ergonomics of the seating are precisely right for my needs and comfort.  I am a small person, and this is the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  Even my husband-- a designer-- has come to enjoy driving it, and I like the fact that although it feels very safe and solid, I don't feel like it is a ""mom"" wagon (nothing against moms-- I am one (!) but am beyond the car seat stage).  I do not understand why this car is not being promoted more visibly by Volvo, as it is unusual and perhaps appealing to a different female market than the typical Volvo consumer. "
volvo,v50,2005,gdsommlier, 01/23/2006,V50 Fun Sportswagon,5,"Great sportswagon with attitude. People think Volvo's can not be fun to drive only safe cars instead.

volvo,v50,2005,R. Firenze, 03/23/2006,Not an Auspicious Start,4,"I've always wanted a Volvo turbo wagon. When I came across a left over 05 T5 AWD..I decided to take a chance on a non-Japanese made car. After only 3K I'm not sure it was a wise decision. Car developed serious left pull,door hinge squeaked loudly,radio freezes on occasion, hinged door on cargo cover rattles so badly I've simply removed it, armrest storage lid stuck and was replaced, as was the power steering pump..yep. It does drive nicely.Ample power.Good handling.Great in foul weather even w/17"" wheels and stock all-season Pilots.I'm averaging 20.2 MPG. After years of driving Japanese cars and dreaming of owing a Volvo I can only hope this doesn't turn out to be a nightmare."
volvo,v50,2005,Sergey, 04/20/2006,Truly European spirit,4,"I have 2.4i auto with sport package and premium audio. It is an amazing fun to drive it. More over, exterior looks very fresh and attracts much attention, especially with my rare color - safari.  On the dynamic side it is OK. Somewhat excessive spin-off at start on wet roads and less than expected acceletation uphill somewhat diminish the fun. Switching from manual transmission I notice annoying transmission lag during sudden change from braking to acceleration.  Interior is very well-thought. It is asthetic, versatile and the most unique i've seen so far. Some extra head room and better road visibility would help a lot. Otherwise enough space everywhere."
volvo,v50,2005,DRinNH, 05/22/2006,Glad I bought IT,4,"Excellent performance and features easily used after careful review of manual.  Great for family of four, while four adults will not be comfortable for long.  The turbo gives this vehicle great pickup and transmission is smooth. My family all love it."

Burgoyne, 06/19/2006,"Fun, Perfect compact size, Great look",4,"Great workmanship inside and out,sharp european lines, solid feel driving and when you close the doors, love the hi-tech fabric on the seats - easy to wipe off and stands up to my two teenagers and the  dogs extremely well ! Perfect small size that is wonderful handling around town and parking but,on the interior, it can get big when you put the back seats down. Volvo has been very good with updating software changes- my automatic had a timing problem shifting between 1st and 2nd  gear in some limited situations and when I took it in, they already had a software update - downloaded it and runs perfectly now. Never had any other problems."

Practical with lots of cargo space. Gas mileage is around 25 mainly in city driving  A cautionary note - I had a problem with road noise/ front suspension , Dealer could not fix it, went to Lemon Law,the car was inspected 4/11/06 by Volvo to confirm the noise was still present after their 4 repair attempts. Four months later I still have not had a refund or replacement and am applying to the State for Arbitration. "

old, it is FINALLY time to move out of 
the mini van and get my wife into 
something a little more enjoyable to 
drive.  We looked at several SUVs 
and ""sport wagons"" but hadn't found 
much that met our requirements of 
being safe & sporty, and that could 
fit 2 kids and the family dog 
comfortably (and that was in our price 
range!).  After doing lots of 
research, we stumbled upon the V50 in 
the 'wagon' section of Edmunds.com and 
decided to head to the local Volvo 
dealer."
volvo,v50,2005,JSapp, 08/07/2004,A Luxury Overbuilt Mazda 3,4,"It has the most solid feel of all the
wagons in its price range with amzingly
rigid chassis. Very good sound
insulation and a fairly relaxed highway
cruiser.
2.4 CYl 5 has adequate power and has a
feel of a small straight 6 with a
pleasant growl. 5sp is light but a bit
vauge. Optional Sport package is an
improvement over the soft but competent
base suspension but still not overly
sporty with definte understeer
detracting from high levels of grip.
Seats are typically comfortable Volvo.
Materials are of high quality. Seating
has adequate room and caro room is good

it more every day...It is comfortable, 
safe and practical. I looked at 
everything available, both wagons and 
SUV's. This was a great choice. I was 
driving a Mercedes SLK 320. I haven't 
compromised speed or handling. This is 
a solid, well made vehicle, with lots

thrilled. Previous car, a Taurus wagon. 
I wanted a wagon again, but a slightly 
smaller one, yet with top safety and 
luxury features. On Edmunds I found the 
V50. We live on a small street with a 
tight driveway, and needed a car that 
could fit and turn in small spaces, yet 
be large enough to feel safe and 
comfortable during family vacations 
[two of us plus one teenager]. Back 
seat is not super roomy, but fine for 
our needs. I am enjoying the pep of the 
T5 engine [auto/FWD], and it certainly 
is 'fun to drive. I do notice a slight 
lag [is this ""Turbo lag""?] when 
accelerating from a stop. Still, minor 
problem with all the positives. A 
beautiful, substantial car."
volvo,v50,2005,Natty Sargent, 12/07/2004,We Love It!,4,"Looked at BMW 3-Series, Audi A4 and 
nobody could touch the Volvo value. The 
Audi dealership admitted that without 
Ford's support, they just couldn't 
compete on price.  The performance 
speaks for itself if you trust the 
reviews and specs.  We bought the 2005 V50 T5
in lieu of the straight 2.4 only because 
of review comments. We drove both and 
really couldn't tell the difference 
when driving like a sane person. The 
additional options that we purchased 
were worth it.  We got everything but 
the navigation pkg. and back up sensors. "

center panel, awesome upgraded stereo, 
and excellent low-end torque (i.e. 
great peppiness when driving). The AWD, 
Volvo safety, and beautiful outward

volvo,v50,2005,T Forbes, 01/01/2005,Volvo V50,4,"I bought this car while overseas.  I 
saved money but the process was 
complicated. Generally, however, this 
is a very solid, well designed car with 
many useful, standard features.  The 
performance with the standard engine is 
better than adequate.  I have already 
driven it in the snow and it is great. 
I did have a problem with the vapor 
recovery system that took 3 days to 
fix, but the dealer was responsive and 
gave me a loaner (S40 with turbo - 
faster but displayed turbo lag). 
Hopefully, the problems are behind me, 
as I am looking forward to many useful 
miles.  This is my first Volvo (Honda 
and VW's in the past) and so far it has 
been positive."
volvo,v50,2005,dmhsg, 01/16/2005,We love it.,4,"Overall, a great wagon. This was my mid-life-crisis-leave-the-Sequoia-at- home-car: fun to drive but still goes up the ski hill, holds a kayak and dogs in the back. We bought the T5 AWD, with most upgrades except stereo and DVD. More headroom than 325ix, performance on par with Audi/BMW wagons for considerably less money. Rides a bit choppy in city, which is OK (and we're on 16 inch wheels), but tends to roll just slightly in spirited cornering unlike BMWs. Turbo thrust is even and strong. Performance on snow is fantastic. No problems. Go for the T5 AWD. In hindsight, I'd get the stereo and DVD NAV. By George, this wagon is a winner for Volvo. "
volvo,v50,2005,Ann Marie, 02/04/2005,"Fabulous, fun, fantastic!!!",5,"You are missing out if you don't drive the new Volvo V50--its pickup is great, the upgraded Bose sound-system is a must-have for any driver.  It's also very easy to park, and has excellent dimensions for trips to Home Depot and picking up bigger items."
volvo,v50,2005,Jon M. , 03/18/2005,Great Buy,4,"After months of research, I decided this sports wagon was the best value for me.  Though I was originally in the market for an SUV, I concluded I would lose at the pump in the end. The direction of gas prices has only validated my decision. The Volvo is a perfect fit.  It's sporty (I love the autostick), very comfortable (leather), sharp interior and exterior, and it has plenty of space for trips to the hardware store. I recommend it. "
volvo,v50,2005,grochef, 03/18/2005,Fun Turbo Wagon,5,"Volvo did a great job of designing this car.  The front end gives the V50 an aggressive look and the large rear tail lights set it off from the crowd.  Standard features are generous and the list of Options provide the ability to create a dream.  I purchased the car using the Overseas Program.  I would recommend that anyone opting for that program does not purchase any accessories from Sweden.  The prices are twice what they are in the US - even though they tell you it is a ""Special Price"".  Other than that, the trip to London, Sweden and Norway was great fun. "
volvo,v50,2005,AnnMarie, 05/06/2005,Fabulous car,5,"This car is sporty, fun to drive, and holds all your purchases from Home Depot.  I made the switch from an SUV to this car and I'm really glad that I did.  Also, if you compare this car to the BMW 3-series wagon, a tall person can actually sit in the back seat of the Volvo wagon as opposed to the BMW 3- series wagon where they'll be crammed in with no leg room."
volvo,v50,2005,BWB, 05/11/2005,Volvo V50 New Review,4,"We purchased this car after looking at a lot of competitive cars.  We liked the minimalist design but full featured interior.  After 1 extended trip of 1700 miles in a weekend, we found the car to be economical, comfortable and very stable.  We are very happy purchasers of the car."
volvo,v50,2005,sean & patti, 06/06/2005,Nice Ride,4,"My wife and I have been driving our new V50 for a little over a month now and have put on 1200 miles. It's definitely a fun car to drive. The cockpit is designed well with all knobs and buttons in easy reach. We ordered the 17"" wheels and love the look they add to the car. It surprises our friends when we stomp on the gas. There is definitely enough power coming out of the engine to satisfy. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a small wagon."
volvo,v50,2005,henrik, 10/01/2005,Volvo made it again!,4,A great car from Volco again! Now they have added some new things to their basket; fun and design now joins reliability and safety.  Some minor flaws in the exterior design...otherwise; buy it!
volvo,v50,2005,KD, 01/12/2006,Love my V50 T5 AWD,4,"I test drove several small wagons, small SUV's and this car was head & shoulders above the rest.  Love the heated seats. Easily load skis!  Now I've had the car for just over 6 months and I STILL LOVE IT!  Now have about 8000 miles on it.  Would buy this car again."
volvo,v50,2005,Rick, 03/17/2006,Great Car,4,"I also have a V40. I love the V50T. It drives great, gets good gas mileage. We are retirees, but we enjoy the spunk, reputation, and durability of the vehicle. The style is outstanding. We have a lot of people come up and admire the car. "
volvo,v50,2005,Gin, 03/20/2006,Joys of the 6-Speed,4,"I researched the car for about 9 months but had to wait to get the manual transmission.  So far it has been a good experience, but it doesn't get as good mileage as my husband's BMW X3 2.5L, and the alternator went at approx. 7K miles.  Highs are the great (stiff) road feel, peppiness, high-quality interior, awesome sound system, and ample back storage.  Lows are the mileage and minimal front storage.  I live in New England and find that the climate package is well worth the added cash."
volvo,v50,2005,Bklyn38, 04/15/2006,V50 WOW!,4,I am amazed at the quick & comfortable performance.  This  is my 5th Volvo and by far the best.  Runs on regular gas with 23.5 City and 32 h'way milage when driven hard.  Exceptionally reliable.  No problems.  Catches stares and compliments even in Manhattan!
volvo,v50,2005,Ann Warner, 05/15/2006,Greatest Car on the Market!,5,"This is the best wagon on the market!  It has all the cargo space that my old SUV did, plus it has safety features found only in Volvo & BMW (whiplash protection seats).  Also, the stereo is phenomenal and it drives like a dream and is easy to park."
volvo,v50,2005,Lenny, 10/21/2006,Consumer Reports Unfair to this Vehicle,4,"Sporty, comfortable ride; Steering luxurious w/short radius; good gas mileage combined with highly responsive engine; excellent dealer service in both New Orleans and Houston (love the loaner cars); seemingly inexhaustible cargo capacity for a compact wagon (three adults, three small dogs, lots of luggage and mother-in-law's personal possessions while evacuating from Katrina to Houston, then evacuating from Rita to Lake Charles and then to fort Smith - tight, but workable); generally far more reliable than CR predicted. Negatives: slightly cramped side-to-side knee room for male driver; imperfect rear vision; bind in driver seatbelt; windshield fluid tank failed (fixed after wait for part)."
volvo,v50,2005,George, 11/21/2006,Wow!,4,"I don't think I could say too many good things about this car. My wife and I got the V50 to replace our old Jetta, which was turned into a dump truck during our home rehab. We have a very active lifestyle and wanted room for sailing, kayaking & backpacking as well as our future child & dog. The back accomidates all our stuff while being small enought to park in the city. We also wanted something eco friendly with good fuel econemy etc.  The V50 is perfect."
volvo,v50,2005,Unhappy, 12/14/2006,Be Careful,3,"I have owned my V50 for 1 1/2 years and I have been unhappy almost since the day I purchased it.  We had to be towed off the highway on the six day of ownership when the turbo went out.  We've had it in for repairs for a faulty radio, faulty cargo compartment and just recently the fuel hoses went out."
volvo,v50,2005,fluffy, 01/03/2007,2 1/2 years with my V50,4,"I bought my V50 as soon as they came out in 2004. I thought the novelty of this beauty would wear off, but now almost 3 years later, we are still in love with this car. It drives superbly, handles excellently, gas mileage is great, comfortable and elegant. We are a family of 4 (all slim though) and fit very well, the kid seats in the back are a huge plus with no ruining of leather. Have traveled all over Europe and the US in it so far and haven't had any problems whatsoever with mechanics. Never had anything broken in it, unlike the 2005 S40 T5 my husband owns, which has had a few problems too many for my comfort.  I recommend this car to all, as it is a super deal for your money!"
volvo,v50,2005,CDF58, 03/13/2007,Needs Work,3,"My 2005 V50 lacks power, the S40 has more ""pick-up"" than this car. It has trouble with even a gradual incline and there's a delay when stepping on the gas to speed up. From the time I took delivery of the car, it had an acceleration issue after slowing down to go over speed bump or turning corners - very annoying. It would seem like it was going to stall when I reapplied pressure to the gas pedal.  Service people didn't know how to fix it for the first 2+ years I owned it. The horn went out, my keys have fallen apart, and I hear a loud click/clunk when I back up while parallel parking.  Visibility is poor - rear view and front-sides of windshield.  Driver seatbelt seizes up regularly. Whew!"
volvo,v50,2006,Jeff, 05/31/2017,Good overall,4,"I got the 2.4 (non-turbo) V50 at carmax years ago for a very low price (great deal- esp compared to other european carmakers, i.e., BMW, Audi).  It has been outstanding in terms of reliability- with one exception, the A/C compressor had to be replaced - around $700; otherwise, great - engine transmission, electronics etc, all solid.  The front seats are very comfortable for a smaller wagon.  Mine is not leather - wish it was - the cloth seats show stains too easily (mine are a light grey color).  I added a bluetooth unit which works great (but that was an aftermarket addition).  Love the cargo in the back with the seats down- excellent space.  The ride is very comfortable and relatively quiet for an inexpensive Volvo wagon.  I wish I had a bigger wagon by Volvo bc i'm sure it would be even more comfortable and have an even better ride.  Handling is just okay-but it's a wagon, not a sports car anyway.  Acceleration is adequate even in the non-turbo 2.4 - again, it's not a sports car but it has enough power to motor past grandma if needbe.  fuel economy is not great for a wagon that's not AWD.  It is FWD just in case you didn't know - some torque steer but it's tolerable to me.  And I don't need AWD here in southern CA.  Can't recall what i paid or date of purchase
"
volvo,v50,2006,LA Commuter, 07/22/2006,Good Value,4,"Traded in my Jag XJ8 VDP for a silver station wagon and so far has little regrets.  Better gas mileage (23 MPG average) compensates for luxury features, and the V50 is a very fine looking car from almost all angles.  What surprised me is how well the car handles.  The downside is ride quality (can feel lots of LA street bumps), and how A/C can draw down gas mileage significantly.  The space behind center controls looks neat, but not very functional.  Overall, a happy owner.  The silver color also means fewer car washes because it doesn't look dirty, as long as you Windex the windows."
volvo,v50,2006,Renee, 10/06/2009,4 Years of Monthly Warranty Repairs,3,"I have owned this vehicle just under 4 yrs. Beginning around 10k miles started having issues. Door locks worked intermittently, small stones would get caught in the rotors,making an awful metal on metal sound, the battery died/car needed towed to dealer at 25k miles, door locks worked sometimes, other times got locked in and had to crawl across passenger seat to get out, a piece of the roof rack would fall off during car washes, and the gas gasket went. Many of things were unable to be fixed and needed multiple service appts.  This was my first and probably last Volvo. I just traded this in for a new Honda, mostly due to the reliability. But I'll miss driving this. It was a blast to drive."
volvo,v50,2006,Chris Brown, 01/02/2006,Best Sport Wagon,5,"Options: premium package with leather and roof. I'm certainly not a wagon fan, and I hate SUV's even more, the big ones are the worst. This car is just plain sexy. It looks great, it drives great, and it's so practical. Ride and handling is better than my C240 trade-in, and in acceleration there's no comparison. I like an upscale car, Volvo is one of the top-tier brands, and I was drawn to it for something with more utility than my sedan. I also have a 3-series convertible and it's fantastic, but the 3-series wagon is pretty plain-jane, and so is the Mercedes wagons. Besides, the Volvo is at least 6 or 8 grand less with comparable equipment. Highly recommended."
volvo,v50,2006,David J Hayden, 06/07/2006,So Close...,4,"So close on design execution.  Beautiful lines on the outside, and for the most part elegant design inside.  Power is surprisingly good, and the handling not bad, though not as tight as my VW; it doesn't feel quite as ""glued"" to the road, at faster speeds gives the impression that it might leap off the payment.   Some minor build quality issues though nothing major.  Falls down a little on ergonomics -- the center console is all digital and impossible to operate (radio, climate control) with your eyes on the road -- no tactile feedback.  The bigger issue is the spacing of the pedals -- my size 11 feet get jammed between the accelerator and the brake!  Overall though a great car."
volvo,v50,2006,Seattle-ite, 08/30/2006,Fun to Drive,5,"Bought my V-50 three months ago, and I have really enjoyed this car.  I replaced a PT Cruiser that was not working out. The V-50 has more cargo room, handles much better, gets better mileage, is much peppier on the  road and is just put together so much better that I can't believe I waited this long to make the change.  This is the best car I have owned in 30 years of buying cars.  It is big enough to haul cargo, and small enough to park easily.  It has that great Volvo turning radius (why doesn't every car maker copy this?) and just feels solid on the road. Visibility is excellent, which was a HUGE problem on the PT.  All in all, I'm a happy new Volvo owner!"
volvo,v50,2006,calguy, 11/30/2006,"Great looks, even better ride!",4,"I love how solid this car feels on the road. There is very little play in the steering wheel. We've had it for almost 17,000 miles and have had no mechanical problems with it. This is by far the best looking small wagon on the market. Volvo sales experience and service are great. Would recommend this car to anyone!"
volvo,v50,2006,chrishel, 07/01/2013,HORRIBLE CAR,2,"bought in 2006 for its safety and reliability. beautiful interior but looks can be deceiving. has just over 100k miles. always regularly maintained.
Anything and everything has gone wrong.. A/c doesnt work. CD player broke 3 years ago. oxygen censors broke. transmission needed to be replaced($5000 cause volvo doesnt sell parts for transmission) now its the alternator. of course this all happens after warrenty has expired.
its been a total nightmare and I will never purchase another volvo"
volvo,v50,2006,Beautiful Car, 08/20/2008,Beautiful Car...Improve Reliability,4,"I have had the car about 1 year. It is a beautiful car in Passion Red and well equipped. It is fun to drive with plenty of power, excellent handling, comfortable ride and is quiet. The biggest issue is an intermittent electrical problem. It has been in for repair over 4 times for more than 20 days with issues with the airbag sensor, door locks, windows, A/C, etc. We have another Volvo (2006 S40 T5) that has been problem free. We've also owned a Volvo XC90 (2004) that was very reliable. We will continue to own Volvos as we like the cars but this particular car (V50)has been a little disappointing. I will say, however, that the dealer has been very diligent in trying to find the problem."
volvo,v50,2006,Brian d, 10/11/2006,Great Fun to Drive and looks good too!,4,"I have owned my V50 since May 06. Have already done a few good road trips with it and am not disappointed.  15,000 km so far.  Had mine special ordered due to wanting the base model (no sunroof, no traction control etc).  Was worth the wait.  5spd shifts like butta and although a high speed pass on a 2 lane hwy may need a downshift, it's a small price to pay.  The ONLY beefs I have are a small wind leak in the driver's door, a squeaky clutch pedal, poor driver's side blind spot and useless door pockets (can't even fit a map in there).  Great car for the money (better than others in that price range), awesome resale value and a really nice ride.  Go try one... you'll like it."
volvo,v50,2006,marc, 04/21/2010,Repeated Electronic problem,2,"I have been having repeated problem with the check engine, engine shutting down on the hwy and ignition key that cannot be removed from the ignition  I bought a volvo for safety and reliability. I never had an accident therefore cannot comment on safety.  On the reliability side it have been very expensive to maintain and very unreliable 1) Day 1 engine light 2) 2 month in ignition key stuck 4) 50K replace all tires alignment not properly done by Volvo dealer 5) 85kRigh rear bearing 6) 100k Engine light and engine shutting down while driving, many trip to the dealer problem disappeared on its own after 125K 7) 145K more problem with ignition key  I'm now look at selling it"
volvo,v50,2006,Mon, 01/27/2010,I wish I could love this car,3,"I have a love/hate relationship with this car. It's the fourth Volvo I've owned and I can tell quality has gone seriously downhill. Yes, the car is fun to drive WHEN it's not at the shop getting repaired. I've had the car for 2.5 years and it is in the shop with various problems about once every 6 weeks, most of the time with recurring problems that miraculously don't show up when it's at the dealership. The car is comfortable, quite roomy and sporty. I love that it's faster than it looks. I just really wish that the car was more reliable. This will be the last Volvo for me. I'm getting rid of it as soon as the warranty's up as I don't think I'll be able to afford the constant repairs!"
volvo,v50,2006,Dave B, 09/16/2010,Dont judge a book by it cover,4,"The car looks great and is fun to drive, but I was spoiled by our Volkswagen Jetta in the reliability department.  The Volvo V 50 has required work since we bought it- wiring harness issues, sun roof leak that we learned will cannot be fully rectified, gas cap issues-would not pass inspection, battery issues, anti- theft-immobilizer issues. The inconvenience is one thing, but now that it is out of warranty, I worry it is going to cost us a great deal to keep it on the road. This will be the first and last Volvo for us."
volvo,v50,2006,amo, 08/26/2005,Fabulous car,5,"I was torn between the BMW X3 and this car.  However, after I drove the Volvo V50 there was no more competition--you have to drive this car to believe how great it is!  The seats are extremely comfortable, it comes with a whiplash protection system, the storage capacity is huge (you wouldn't believe how much stuff this car holds), and the back sets have a lot more leg-room than the BMW 3 series wagons."
volvo,v50,2006,Gryphon, 04/13/2006,Great Car,4,"Went to by a ""SMART"" car. Ended up with my Volvo. For the mileage I put on it was the vehicle for me. Lots of room for my clubs, skis, mountain bike and weimariner."

volvo,v50,2006,Mike R., 07/30/2006,My thoughts on Volvo's V50,5,"We really like this car. It's small enough to get around town, yet large enough to haul most anything we want. The folks at Volvo know what comfort is and this car is no exception. It has style, and the interior is quite comfortable. Plenty of leg room and head room."
volvo,v50,2006,L. Taylor, 10/11/2007,Don't Buy this Car,1,"I sold a car with 165,000 miles on it because I was tired of taking it into the shop each month. Since buying my V50, I have had to take it into the shop almost every month. It has had repeated electrical problems that don't end. The same problems keeps coming back. "
volvo,v50,2006,walrus17, 04/17/2013,2006 Volvo V-50,4,"Other than rountine maintenance for a car with 149K, it's been a reliable car. I did have a problem with an air/fuel sensor that was going bad and would not show up on the computer codes. Thought I had water in the fuel, but replaced the sensor for $397.00 and have had no further problems.
My car is a turbo 5 cylinder with all wheel drive and it has no power issues.
The car handles well in the snow and on wet roads. The vehicle is comfortalbe to drive and has heated leather seats. For a sport wagon with a sun roof, it's a great family car, that I would recommend. "
volvo,v50,2006,Volblow, 04/19/2007,Great but flawed reliability,3,"When this car works or isn't being repaired, it is delightful. I love the Scandinavian style, but hate the quality."
volvo,v50,2006,J.Smeriglio, 08/21/2007,Worth the price,4,"The 2006 V-50 is an excellent every day driver.  I put 150-200 miles per day on this vehicle and have not had any major complaints other than the complete battery failure at 51,000 miles (a $200 replacement at volvo).  I have noticed 26-28 mpg consistently at 70 mph cruising speed.  Excellent steering response, excellent brakes, and very comfortable driver seating. I would absolutely purchase this car again.  "
volvo,v50,2006,Mike, 08/12/2005,Sports car with space,4,"I love this car. It's the smallest of the three Volvos I've owned (previous cars: 245DL wagon and an 850 sedan), but by far the most fun. I wanted a car with sports car-like handling and acceleration, but I also wanted space in the back to accommodate, for instance, a couple of bales of peat moss.  I got it all. The car flies--merging onto the highway is really fun now--and  its power is evident at low RPMs, too. I have the brushed aluminum interior and it's very cool.   Cons: There's not a great deal of storage space up front, and the back seats are a little tight for normal-sized adults, but we have an SUV for long trips. A great driver's car."
volvo,v50,2006,Fred Torres, 09/28/2005,Fred's Volvo V50,5,"I bought this car from Power Volvo Irvine. Picked up the car in Gothenborg, Sweden. Drove it for 4,800 miles in Northern Europe (Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, France) for five weeks. It's Autobahn certified. Lots of fun. This car is as good as claimed. Lots of get-up-and-go, extremely brisk. The car is now garaged here at our home in California and it has become a precious and memorable souvenir. "

volvo,v50,2006,Peter, 03/29/2006,a good performance wagon,4,"I have to replace a Volvo 240DL wagon and BMW328i. V50 has a nice combination of the virtues of both. It is big enough as a family wagon and is sporty enough to be fun to drive (the 240DL drives like a truck). It has all the electronic and computer gadgets of my 1999 328i, although its acceleration and handling are not as good. I have always driven a manual transmission so I was a bit skeptical about the Geartronics.  It turns out to be quite acceptable. I can use it to slow down the car. When going up to Lake Tahoe I can down-shift to gain more power. The mileage after 6K miles is a decent 25 mpg, better than the BMW. I will be quite happy if it turns out to be more reliable than the BMW."
volvo,v50,2006,A H, 04/08/2006,Tuuuuurrrrbbbooooo,4,"The T5 is a must.  I test drove the 2.4 and the T5, the T5 blows the other away.  The car has excellent pick up that will dust even the most agressive cab drivers.  Sleek inside and outside styling.  The car feels sturdy and sporty.  It ain't your father's Volvo.  Fremont Volvo in Fremont, CA made us a fabulous lease deal."

I have 13,000 miles on my V50 and I still look forward to driving to work or just driving.  It's got lots of pep and it handles like a sports sedan.  A couple of upgrades to the firmware took care of some radio and climate control quirks."
volvo,v50,2006,jjholmgr, 10/15/2005,Great Little Wagon,4,"Worth a look if you need a flexible vehicle for a small family.  Power is solid even with auto although doesn't ""feel"" as quick as I expected.  Seats are super comfortable.  New cloth/suede material is very nice and seems to be more durable than old Volvo cloth/vinyl interiors.  Gas tank is a little small compared to other Volvos but we average 27 mpg in mixed driving, best was 30.  We already have snow on the ground and the DTSC keeps it sure footed even without AWD--I'm not convinced it is worth the extra plus you loss mpg."
volvo,v50,2006,Eric, 02/15/2006,Awesome Sport Wagon,4,"After a trip to the vet with the dog, cat and kid in my Mustang, I realized that I needed a sport wagon.  Looked at fully loaded versions of the V50, BMW 3 Wagon, Audi A3.  The V50 won out based on both HP and Torque as well as price.  The ride/handling, build quality and gas mileage are all great.  Navigation system, controlled by steering wheel controls is awesome.   "
volvo,v50,2006,CO Yogi, 04/02/2006,Fun wagon!,5,"This is am awesome car! It is a great combination of power, fun & economy. Passes even better than my old Olds jetstar with a 425!

The second one has been in the shop three times for new brakes and numerous problems with the air conditioning and electrical system.

volvo,v50,2006,swedejunk, 11/01/2006,Poor quality control Not very relieble,2,This car is most expensive headache you will buy. It has a lot of electrical issues. I have premium audio which gives me trouble intermittently and no one at Volvo knows how to fix it. Also navigation system is too sophisticated for volvo to trouble shoot. Besides that the customer care people are insensitive even if you make one trip a month to the dealership for fixing something or the other. NOW NO LONGER do volvo cars get top ratings in safety either. 
volvo,v50,2006,CEB, 04/27/2008,Electrical System not Reliable,3,"Imagine driving the highway at speed and experiencing a complete electrical system failure.  After two years and multiple dealer ""remedies"" including replacement of major electrical components, these problems continue and overshadow an otherwise decent vehicle.  Often the car simply will not start, but when you get it to the dealer they cannot duplicate your issue and appear to be unable to troubleshoot.  For the money, the Audi A4, Volkswagen Passat or the C-class MB wagon (no longer sold) are better options."
volvo,v50,2007,mattypv50, 12/04/2012,Good Car,3,"Mine has 156,000KM on it. Bought it as a demo with 22,000KM (Canada).

It's been good. Here is a list of things that needed repair:

1. Ambient temperature gauge wouldn't work causing the A/C to malfunction. This required 3 trips to the dear to fix it
2. A/C Air Compressor died around 130,000km
3. Both wheel bearings needed to be replaced

5. One day while driving the car just full on shut down. Had it towed and it was a fuel line sensor

I think that's about it. So only left me stranded once. Overall, a pretty good car. "
volvo,v50,2007,jroberts, 04/18/2010,V50 Problems,4,"I have driven Volvo for twenty years. I traded my 1994 940 in 2007 for the V50, Big Mistake! Within the first 45 days problems began.I was told that the computer didn't find any problems. After monthly visits and 1.5 years  the dealership took me seriously & VOLVO created a download to correct the car computer,things seemed better. Then 6 months later the horn began to honk for periods of 5 miles. Once again I was told that the computer didn't show a problem. Unable to deal with the monthly trips to the dealership I traded for a Mercedes. I feel like a traitor, but apparently there are problems that exist that the computer doesn't show."
volvo,v50,2007,ChrisM, 10/21/2008,Follow up,4,"Had the car for just under a year and 16000 kms (10,000 miles). No mechanical problems at all, I have only done two scheduled maintenances on the car. My longest trip has been about 500 kms (300 mi) and the car performed very well. In town mileage has been around 24 mpg (US) and highway mileage in the mid 30s. Service at the dealership has been very good. The factory Continental tires were replaced at 36000 kms and replaced with Nokians. The factory tires never seem to last too long. Still very much enjoying my first Volvo."
volvo,v50,2007,signal67, 06/16/2007,MIGHTY MITE V50,5,"Superbly designed vehicle that is an absolute blast to drive. Mine is the ""Full Monty"" T5 AWD with buttery-smooth 6 speed manual. Seems like every design and engineering detail was painstakingly tested and mulled over to best benefit the driver. Gives me 85% of the performance I expect from my '85 Porsche 911. I can haul my ever-growing toddler son in his Recaro sport seat and my two 90 lb. Weimaraners (very tall, large dogs).  A great-looking vehicle as well that really grabs on-lookers' attention.  Most people think of AWD for icy, snowy environments, but here in L.A., I like it for added performance - goodbye torque steer, understeer, oversteer, etc.  A total beast. "
volvo,v50,2007,krgrimes, 07/01/2011,Massive Mistake,2,"I begged my husband to trade in my '99 4Runner for a more stable vehicle on the highway so he got me an '07 Volvo V50. Took it on the highway and it was amazing, but then I started to notice little noises you wouldn't expect to hear in a ""luxury"" vehicle. Had the tires and rear brakes replaced and it got quieter but there is still noise. It is starting to get really hot in NC so I'm using my A/C frequently, that is of course when the compressor wants to work. Today I put my key in the ignition and the car ""immobilized"" because it thought I was trying to steal my own car. On top of the grinding noise in my front wheel bearings I now have electrical problems! Do not buy one!"

volvo,v50,2007,RJBME, 10/16/2006,So far..so great!,4,"Have had this car a month & have been able to do commuting and a 1500 mi road trip with it. Great car that isn't more than what you need (SUV) or too little (5-dr hatch). The p/t is fantastic: smooth, powerful & quick and the 6-spd manual makes the car all that much more fun to drive. The seats & options (ours is loaded) make the car a dream to drive. I highly recommend the NAV system as it performed flawlessly on our trip.  The gas milage is coming in a bit lower (~24.3 combo according to computer) that I had hoped for in a 5cyl+manual but it's better than an SUV considering the V50 has AWD+ 218 hp/236 ft-lbs & all functionality w/ lots of cargo space. Best car I've owned thus far."
volvo,v50,2007,Mustang chef, 11/21/2015,Finally got one!,4,"I drove a number of Ford Focus, my wife had a v50.....every time I drove her car I was jealous.
I finally found an 07 for myself. The car has changed my life.
It had 119k on it ,so I knew I would have to do some work on it. ..but I didn't care, for what I paid for it I was well ahead of the game and I like working on cars...it was so worth it ...They talk about the simple Sweed design....well it's pretty easy to work on too. What you typically don't hear about is how well this car is insulated....it's amazingly quiet and warm.
All cars have their problems, and this one is worth them.
I have a number of nice cars/trucks......I am The Mustang Chef
Volvos are cool.

still have it and love it , pull my rowing shell with it [html removed]
Update Nov..2018...paid 3500 with 119000 Miles on it. It just turned over 216000 Miles. Looking for another one just like it!
2007 silver......so I can replace it without my boss knowing I bought another one!hahaha
Would love a 2015v60...hope the Chinese aren’t fffing them up.

 Going into winter of 2019/20....still pulling my rowing shell( cost more than the car) with it and still getting compliments on it.  Put it away for the winter now...saving it for lake trips and regattas only .   A few months ago I put it up for sale on CraigsList , I don’t know what I was thinking.... the huge amount of interest woke me back up and i took it off the listing. So happy i still have it. PS.... My daily driver now is a Focus ST...what a blast!
Nov. 26 2020 ..my 2007  Volvo v 50 still tows my rowing shell. It won’t quit, its almost embarrassing.At 232k i just put new shocks and struts on ...i would never dream of doing that to another vehicle with that many miles. It doesn’t burn oil!! Next spring I’ll replace the timing belt for the second time!! it refuses to rust .  How did they make this car so quiet ?

volvo,v50,2007,david, 11/15/2006,V50 2.4i 4dr Wagon (2.4L 5 cyl 5A),5,"Just bought our V50 yesterday and had an above average experience at the local dealer.  Not pushy at all.  Gave us a fair value on our trade in ('93 Mazda 626).   Car cost $30,000 + tax/tags.  We also got 2.9% financing for 4 years.  Car was loaded with following packages;  Black Paint, Black Leather, Climate, Select, Trim Package, Body Styling package, Sirius Sat Radio.  Very good looking wagon.  I believe this was a fair price considering the added packages it came with and financing package (in lieu of incentives).  Still need to drive it more for a review on handling but for a small family it appears to be a great alternative to a gas guzzling SUV. "

In short, perfectly quality built for saftety without sacrificing performance and fun of driving. I got it on 15km. Overall it has been giving me satisfaction out of expectation. Very responsive, Powerful enough of its class, running stable like a rock, outstanding sound system - feel indulged driving as listening; strong sense of safety sitting in the car. Wonderful small family car, beautifully designed for storage and family traveling; every function works perfectly. "

Bought a 2007 fwd turbo T5 with only 17,500 miles on it for 22k fully loaded all the extras.

volvo,v50,2007,igioman, 10/29/2006,Greatsporty compact wagon,4,"This car, so far, has impressed us with the acceleration, comfort and overall good looks. We got rid of a SUV, and this is a great alternative. In Southern Italy where we live, it isn't uncommon for people to drive quite fast(80-100 MPH/130-160 KPH) yet this car keeps up with them all. The styling is top notch and is the best in it's class. We bought the V50 2.4, Grey metallic with dark beige interior premium sound with 12 speakers. Wow!!. Awesome! We have 3 daughters ages 13, 6 and 1 year and they all fit well even with a car seat.We looked at several other Euro wagons and this Volvo tops them all. "

I am of the belief that you do not need a SUV just to live in the mountains (unlike everyone that lives around me). The AWD is all you need to survive up here. The interior design is simple and intuitive, the performance is great, the mileage is decent (considering the way I like to zoom around), the cargo space is great, and it looks awesome. I seriously don't understand why this car isn't more popular, but then again, I don't understand why everyone around me drives these monstrous SUVs. Aren't they driving on the same roads I am? "
volvo,v50,2007,Allen, 06/22/2007,My Little Pocket Rocket,4,"I get raves from a lot of other drivers and what a blast to drive this V50 is. Fort Knox on wheels too as Volvo is famous for safety. The Japanese made tranny matched to the 218 ponies makes it a dream to drive. Easy to be at 80+ mph and feels like 40. Quick on acceleration, shoots from the gate and leaves a lot of other cars in the dust! I say Volvo finally got it right in styling, interior, safety, guts, all there! I upgraded wheels to 17"", tinted all windows and this baby stands out on the road."

volvo,v50,2007,Frank C, 10/26/2006,2007 Volvo V50 T5,4,"Volvo follows a distinct car philosophy which is not to everyone's taste. If you like Volvo's approach to design, handling, and safety the V50 is a great choice over any small SUV.  We compared the V50 to station wagons from BMW, VW, Audi, and Subaru.  The BMW 3 series and Audi A4, while nice,  were quite a bit more expensive.  The Passat's drive train (2.0l 4 cylinder turbo) was uncompetitive.  The Subaru felt tinny.  In sum, the V50 offered the best compromise between performance and price."

volvo,v50,2007,ralf, 02/09/2009,Great!... but not THAT Great!,4,"I've driven for over 2 years, lease is up in a few months. The negatives are always easier so... Visibility: Ironically, the safety features detract from visibility. I removed the huge rear seat head supports in order to see the small rear window. The front columns are so thick they create a blind spot. Eats up power steering fluid (typical European?)- Have to replenish in less than 1 year. Wind Noise as stated elsewhere. I avoid bumps. It DOES NOT ride like a Town Car. Maybe it's the stock Contis? They're terrible in the snow. Pros: Adequate acceleration, I don't need 0- 60 in 5 secs. Very responsive handling, just don't run out of the expensive PS fluid. Great Looks.    "

volvo,v50,2007,Empty Nesters, 02/03/2007,Done with minivans,4,"We sent the last of three kids off to college this year and were so happy to be done with the big, automatic transmission minivans.  Had noticed the aerodynamic design of the v50 on the road--more appealing than many other sport cars-- and also the added flexibility of a small wagon for storage.  Bought the v50 t5 awd with a standard transmission.  What a great car!  great acceleration, handling, and responsiveness.  No problem in snowy or icy conditions.  The seats are the best- - even for long trips. Mixed driving in the mid twenties/gallon.  Highway on cruise control is over 30.  Any negatives?  the trim on the inside door handle is a little soft and has couple of dings from my ring."
volvo,v50,2007,piredon, 12/16/2007,Great little car,4,"This car manages to be quick when you want it to be, cruise when you want it to, seems to work well in the snow, and holds more than enough stuff to fit our needs.  Fuel mileage so far of around 25 mpg overall.  Comfortable seats, great for long trips.  Very progressive throttle tip in helps to drive smoothly.  Engine can be a little buzzy at times, but packs plenty of punch when you want it to.  Steering effort is way too light, but turn in is crisp, and it's great for long highway trips, maybe not so much for back roads.  Well-designed, intuitive interior with fantastic sound system.  Only problem so far is a rattle in the dash, fixed under warranty."
volvo,v50,2007,ChrisM, 12/17/2007,First Impressions,4,"I've had the car for only two weeks but here are my thoughts so far. Love the looks both inside and out, the appearance is what sold me on the V50. Excellent seats, smooth shifting automatic trans, reasonable performance from the 2.4i engine. I haven't owned a Volvo before so the long term reliability is a bit of a concern. Early versions of this model seemed to suffer from electrical problems but my research on the '07 models seemed to show they have been worked out. I will post a follow up report after I've put more mileage on it."
volvo,v50,2007,Frank, 12/17/2007,Great Car !,4,Had the car for almost a year now and I love it more now than when I bought it.  It has the ride of a Town Car and the fuel mileage is great (26-31).  I bought the premium sound system and several upgrades and haven't been disapointed one bit.  It's a solid car and gives a lot of bang for the buck!
volvo,v50,2007,hollydnc, 07/06/2009,Love this Wagon,4,"This is my first wagon and I love the style and functionality of this car.  I have had a couple of stain issues with the neoprene seats, but so far they have cleaned up pretty well with upholstery cleaner.  I mainly purchased this vehicle to tote around my two dogs, but I also feel stylish driving around town.  A bit of a premium price, but after two years, I am a happy volvo owner.  We will see if it holds up as well as my Honda after 7 years, but doing great so far."
volvo,v50,2007,First Timer, 06/20/2007,First Time Luxury,5,"The Volvo V50 is my first time venturing into the high end car lines and it hasn't disappointed.  The car is neat looking and has thus far performed very well.  Didn't even notice the speed when we were cruising the 476 Blue Route at 75 mph.  The ride is quiet and the feel is quite snug in this little wagon.  We just became grandparents, and we wanted to be safe carting our new charge around.  I think we made the right move."
volvo,v50,2007,jeff, 05/19/2008,My First New Car,4,"This is my first new car, but second Volvo. As you can see, i have put many miles in the comfortable drivers seat. I dread the end of the warranty period. I have traveled to Florida with my two children in car seats, Vermont with my three children in car seats. Plenty of room for a family with reasonable needs.  Turbo is a must. I really wanted a sport wagon, having quit the SUV era before it even became popular. Familiar with Volvo's saftey and reliability and overall this car has perfomed.  Euro styling, roof rails, turbo, interior cargo space, all were items that I wanted and received in a vehicle."
volvo,v50,2008,SueZQ, 11/22/2010,Love my car... but.,4,"I've had my V50 over 2 years now.  No repairs, no problems, some minor issues (buzz in a speaker, vibration here & there) but for the most part, amazing reliability.  Tires totally worn at 45,000 miles.  Great fuel economy (over 32 mpg on long drives below 70 mph with a/c off).  Cargo space limited for a wagon, but fits a lot of stuff.  My problem is the seats.  No lumbar support, and headrest tilts forward forcing me to push my head forward.  Long drives leave me with hip and lower back pain, and now neck pain and headaches.  I am having to give up my wonderful car because no amount of padding or support has fixed this.  So be very sure the seat supports you fully before you buy."

The reviews on this little car swayed my decision to test drive. Owned it a year now and 20k miles later, no disappointments. All cars have quirks, this car has been pleasant. I have had many cars in the past 5 BMWs, 12 VWs and 7 Porsches. I am a car enthusiast, this car has enough character to make it stand out. "

For 50% of the price I have as much fun driving this car and I don't have to fear being stranded because of quality problems with electronics.  The ride is firm but not harsh, a lot like a 3 series BMW. Ergonomics are a bit quirky and I could use more storage space up front. Fuel economy is better than my E500, but not that much! I miss the Bluetooth for the phone. Overall, no regrets"

volvo,v50,2008,mitch, 11/20/2007,Utterly unique in a sea of sameness,4,"This car's smart! Not generic Japanese, nor flashy BMW. Distinctive, so few on the road. Why? Designers have done super-sculptural job w/sheet metal around wheels, hood, roofline. Handsome! Perfectly scaled, hauls stuff but still comfy compact footprint. Fab interior for a 6'3""guy, though leaves back seats cramped. Settling into front is like puttting on fine gloves, famous Volvo seats coddle. Easy, high quality controls aren't over-baked. Zippy turbo rocks. Nice throaty engine. You feel all the road bumps, suspension tight. A little oversteer. Not a big issue. I just love the Volvo ethos, low key class, a bit quirky, solid, albeit at a price."

The dealership is not my favorite but the price was pretty good and the certified warranty added extra safety.   The ride in dry conditions is good, the cabin is very quite, the sound system is very good although my car lacks the bluetooth and ipod controls which would have been a nice add-on.  I guess that's the price you pay for buying used.  The one thing I do not like about this car is the winter handling.  I did not purchase the AWD and coming from Subaru this is a HUGE disappointment.  "

The rear roof tapers down so much that load capacity is severely limited, and this includes large dogs who bump their heads on entry. Mileage is about 20. The manual supports use of 87 Octane and up. We have owned 5 previous Volvo wagons going back to 1971. This vehicle doesn't compete !! Worried for the future of Volvo!!"

R design 4dr wagon.
We have previously owned 5 Volvo wagons since l971, each of which was ""my"" car,and our adult children have had six Volvos. Tom's
criticism of my V50 was a little harsh, and unfair to compare it to our larger, more substantial wagons, the last of which was traded in on the V50 simply to reduce the turning circle from 43'+ to 35'+.
The keyless entry has caused hassle and extra expense.
Volvo recently changed the cap for driver's door.....
let's hope it works!!"
volvo,v50,2009,eugene, 01/04/2009,I like it,4,"The car drives wonderfully. It's my first new car, and I am quite happy with my decision. So far, no problems; but then again, I've only got 2000 miles on the car. Back seat is a little tight, if you've got tall folks in the front seat. Having cargo room is great, and the size of the vehicle is perfect for New York City. Sometimes I look out the window at my car parked outside, and watch pedestrians admiring the car as they walk past. The car is definitely a head-turner. The BMWs and Audis are way too common here."
volvo,v50,2009,Joel in Germany, 05/21/2009,It's a looker...for a wagon!,4,"I drive it on the Autobahn in Europe, my normal speed...100 - 115 mph.  It has plenty of power, comfortable seating, plenty of cargo room...it is what it is...a sportswagon. I purchased a few extras for it that you can't get in the states to include the color.  Great experience with Volvo!  Nice car!  It replaced my 2002 Mini Cooper.  I hope to have this Volvo for years to come!"
volvo,v50,2009,crs, 06/08/2009,pricey but nice,4,"V50 R, is my 4th Volvo (still have XC90 and C30, recently traded xc70) First impression is the V5o isn't up t the high standard of the others. I really got the feeling that I was in a rebadged Focus. Funny thing is though this car can grow you on. The comforts are subtle. Performance is great, handling is top notch( unless you hit bumps then you feel the sport suspension) For city driving with the kids it is perfect, neither too small( C30, nor too big XC90)  Volvo has switched to this clunky menu/ enter / select / exit audio and phone control system which stinks. Huge distraction which ought not be tried while driving. Odd development for a car that promotes safety. The previous was better"
volvo,v50,2009,The Bird, 01/25/2010,Why Subaru copies VOLVO!,4,"This is the main reason Subaru is in existence...to offer a cheaply made alternative to people that can't quite afford a premium European brand. This car has it all! It's equipped with a Haldex AWD system years ahead of the Subaru technology. Lower noise than the subaru. ""Safe and Sound"" warranty 5 years of cost free ownership is unmatched in the industry! I will only need to pay for tires and gas for 5 years! It is above average in every respect."

volvo,v50,2009,Nick, 04/25/2009,Great small wagon,4,Greatly enjoy the car.  Feels safe and is quick and fun to drive. Not quite as quick as my wifes' BMW and has slight turbo lag but much less than previous turbos I have owned. Used to go skiing many times this winter without any problems.  Very practical and reasonable mileage.  The car is attractive and distinct.  Interior is very comfortable but back seat is cramped for adults.
volvo,v50,2009,Kid friendly, 08/03/2009,very family friendly,4,"I sold my Jeep for a reason of too much as thirsty and bought this V50.  Awesome quality! Although it does not have the power and torque feel like the Jeep, it suits the purpose of ""utility"".  I would not complain about the road noise like other reviewers, because it's MUCH less compared to the Jeep.  The seats fold flat, even the passenger seat folds down. I carry my 2 kids, plus their bicycles, balls, toys in the back cargo space, and still have space to spare. The car drives smoothly; the audio system is good. It's just perfect for a small family. My only problem is the gas mileage.  I have not reached the 31 mpg as the manufacture stated. I averaged about 25-26 mpg in mixed driving."

volvo,v50,2011,v50, 04/10/2011,bigger and better,4,"I have an 04 V40 with 70K miles and have had exactly 1 mechanical (one of the tumblers on the ignition lock failed).
The V40 was a Mitsubishi joint venture and that car feels more Japanese than the V50.
The V50 is bigger, heavier, roomier, safer, more powerful and gets about the same mpg's.
Both cars have an elegant simplicity to them.
The V50 is understated and easy to live with.
If I drive slow I average 25 mpg with a mix of highway and around town.
If you need power its there.
The 5 cylinder turbo has been in production for years and should be reliable.
5 years 60K mile bumper to bumper warranty and free maintenance is unmatched. Like all Volvo's = many safety features."
volvo,v50,2011,teagardin, 03/18/2011,"A good car, but could be better",3,"Owned v50 for over a year. Styling is excellent. After a year, still like looking at the car. The interior is unequaled in this class,
high-end minimalism, nothing annoying visually.
Power is not one horsepower more or less than 'average'. Wish it had 5 more horses at least, but not bad. Disappointing mileage--18-19 city, and maybe 22 highway. Should be better! The handling is so-so. The suspension takes bumps fairly hard, and feels 'rough' on dips and larger bumps or road imperfections. Just stable enough. Feels European, in a good, but not great way. Good utility. Good space. Visibility is compromised by FAT pillars. Overall, recommend this car. But... don't love it really."
volvo,v50,2011,darkknight1999, 03/16/2011,Sadly we're mostly disappointed,3,"Well in a little over a year and I'm done with this car. The quality is just not there for the money. Things break inside and out. 

Examples: The plastic cap on the e-brake pops off and is now floating around the car; the rear tow hook bumper plug broke and fell out, so thats now missing; the front seat covers on the back that are roll under and clipped in pop off and are lose. 
The engine is loud... almost sounds broken. The brakes give off sooooo much dust if you don't wash the wheels twice a week in a month they'll be black. The tires that came stock, out of a list of 30 different tires are number 27... almost the worst you can get. Not exactly Safe+Sound!!!

Snow tire are a must!!!"
volvo,v50,2011,barbarao, 02/10/2011,Factory delivery is the best!,5,"Irecently picked up my car at the factory in Gothenburg, Sweden, and cannot say enough for the quality of that experience alone. Volvo goes all out to take care of every detail. This is my second time signing for the car in Sweden. My 2nd experience was as flawless as the 1st. Now to the car..WOW! A beautifully built car, wonderful to drive even on the snowy streets and freeways of Europe in a major snowstorm. I kept up with the best of the experienced drivers on the ""fast"" Autobahn in Hamburg, Germany. I bought the R design and it is stunning, inside and out. Try the overseas program Volvo offers, it truly is the best in the world. Now, about the local dealership in Monterey, CA.. The best!"
volvo,v70,2000,edanstrekal@live.com, 09/18/2015,Best money I ever spent on a used car--still!,5,"I've owned quite a few used cars.  I was always attracted to unique or freaky cars--old Volkswagens, Cadillacs, 1980s Audis, and more recently Saabs.  I always wanted a Volvo wagon because I thought they looked cool and I'd heard good things about reliability of the 2.4L five cylinder engine.  I was a little hesitant about the electrical system as it seems all European vehicles have electrical issues, some more so than others.  With that being said, this is by far one of the finest vehicles I have ever owned (and I only paid $2500)!  

I bought it from the second owner with around 178K miles on it.  The former owner provided me with all the maintenance records from the time it was new.  In the last couple of years, he himself had addressed many of the preventative maintenance issues including timing belt, brakes, shocks, and radiator.  The only issues were the lock on the tailgate doesn't work with the central locking system and there is a bulb burned out behind the odometer.  

Since I've owned it, I've just kept the oil changed, tires rotated, and replaced the plugs and air filter when necessary.  I've had a few issues with the check engine light coming on now and then, but I've just cleaned the MAF and throttle body thoroughly and that seems to have fixed it now for over  a year and a half!  It passes smog with flying colors.  Update: I did recently replace the upper o2 sensor on account of the CEL not turning off.  I unfortunately broke a few vacuum lines in the process, but everything is okay!  CEL went off and the car is again running like a top.

The wagon is very utilitarian.  I can carry all kinds of things in the back, bikes, dressers, tables, almost anything within reason.  More recently I've been using the car to haul stuff for the events business my wife works for.  I haul all kinds of flowers, chairs, linens, etc up to Lake Tahoe without problems.  The heating and cooling are much better than expected (the A/C is great actually), and the acceleration for being a non-turbo isn't half bad.  It's not a hot rod, but it has the power to go up and down over the Sierra Nevada mountains, which I often do on my way to Sacramento.  The seats are some of the most comfortable I've ever experienced (I just wish mine had the heated leather).  It is always nice returning to my Volvo after having a rental car.  As far as gas mileage is concerned I average about 23.3 around town, and on long trips I can usually manage over 30.  That's not half bad for a car this size and weight.  Although it rattles, and it isn't the smoothest ride, it handles well, always starts up, and just keeps on going at even with 201,000 miles.  It doesn't burn any oil and everything functions as it should, sans the tailgate lock.  A great bang for your buck, and since it's old I really don't care what happens to it.  I think this car has sold me on buying another Volvo in the future.

Update:
I parted ways with my V70 last weekend.  I bought a slightly newer S60 with AWD.  I am really hoping for the same reliability as the old wagon, but only time will tell.  It had about 204,000 with no signs of slowing down anytime soon.  The new owner was hard-pressed to find any real issues with the thing.  I sold it to him for $1000, and I think it was a great deal.  One thing is for sure, I'll never forget the joy and piece of mind this car brought me during ownership.

volvo,v70,2000,Banjo, 05/31/2010,Great experience with 2000 V70 XC,4,"Few things to mention. Owned it for 24 months, found that a 10 year old Volvo is like a 3 year old domestic. When I buy used I take the following precautions: 
1. replaced the oil every 3 months, regardless; air filter every year. 
2. always replace the thermostat, battery, and change your antifreeze 
3. drive it like its age. this turbo can toss your head back but it is aging. so why f&k with the tranny and engine, capisce? 
4. keep her clean, wash it. 
5. check engine and other lights are overrated, look into the real problem using a 'european' mechanic. Domestic tech kids should remain in their toyRus sandbox. Volvos and Subarus are easy to fix but use a 'pro'fessional. 
6. Read the manual.

At the time, the decision was driven a practical one - less expensive to own and maintain, more room for a family of 4 and performance in the snow.
2 years later, I couldn't be happier with the decision.
It has been reliable and everything I need in a vehicle with the exception of looking cool.
Fortunately, I'm way past worrying about looking cool."

Other than eating up tires it really was a good car until no one caught the leak in the transfer case ($1,700 bad mechanic/$780 dealership fixed).
ABS went bad but as eariler - Victor Rocha is a GOD! ($125).

Sadly, declared total by ins. co. Paint still great. Glass great. Interior somewhat dirty from heavy child use. Total net expenses less than $10000 for 50000 miles (20cents/mi): best I've had in many years. Have already purchased another V70 (2003) to replace it.

Just found out I need a new catalytic converter and two O2 sensor - another $1700 repair.  This time, I'm trading it in - I just can't see putting any more money into this car!

I love the car, the way it looks, and the safety features. However, I never know what is going to fail next. We purchased a Volvo because of their excellent reputation, or so we thought. The transmission, ABS module, just to name a few major failures. If your ABS module fails search Victor Rocha volvo on google. Highly recommended, and saved us over $1000!"
volvo,v70,2000,Brimmer Morrison, 07/16/2018,My blue v70,5,"This has been my first car and it still works perfectly after 18 years of the car being in operation. I got the car an aux cord and a fluid change and it was back like new. SUPER COMFY and SUPER SAFE, heated seats still work but some of the engine and break sensors are a little off and wonky but still work. The engine sounds great but since the car weighs about 2 tonnes it doesn’t get great gas mileage. If you treat the car nicely you shouldn’t need to bring it into the shop too often. It is also great for tall people(I’m 6’5”)

volvo,v70,2000,depressed, 02/19/2009,Money pit,3,"We bought this car 3 months ago and it's already in the shop with a blown head gasket (the major problem) and a leaking AWD box, total cost to get our car back is $3,100.00 if they don't find anything else wrong. None of the local import mehcanics could fix the head gasket so we had to have it towed to the nearest Volvo dealership 90 miles away.  As soon as we get the car back it's getting traded in. Apparently when they get near 100,000 they are no longer dependable and I've been told to expect between 1,500.00 and 2,500.00 for every repair. It's not worth it. Our passenger side window doesn't work either.  "
volvo,v70,2000,ds, 03/12/2009,My 3rd and thankfully LAST Volvo,2,"This car year was a lemon from the get-go and under no circumstance buy this car. Something was always wrong-at first it was the electrical system, then the headlights, then the gas cap not opening so that the entire rear interior panel had to be removed twice and on long trips. In 7 years of ownership we paid more in time and money for repairs than for the original purchase price. The seats are so uncomfortable and scrunch the driver that I had a painful hip and drove sitting on a pillow the last year of ownership. Volvo service and parts are super expensive and the Volvo dealers in my area are arrogant. It is nice not having to throw away money!  Returned to Toyota-much more satisfied."

V70 SE.  We were fortunate to get the ultimate treatment when we 
purchased our Volvo directly from Volvo Intl., and picked it up in

was no option in my mind. On the other

Dealership had just gone through it and I have the $2K receipt to prove it. Immediately I had problems with the front axle. My mechanic was able to get Volvo to pick up the $2K bill. When the vehicle hit 75K miles the car began falling apart. Turbo went out $2.5K.  Car never drove the same after changing it out at the dealership. Shudders, runs rough. 2 months later the fuel pump went out another $2K. 1 month the axle and AWD need repair another $1K. When it goes it goes and nothing is cheap.  Not your ideal vehicle if you cannot afford expensive, frequent repairs. "

In just two months, over $2000 put into it, and the check engine light came on couple of days ago, with codes for an oxygen sensor and catalytic converter.  The interior is cheap and noisy, crazy squeaks and rattles.  Alternator died, leaving me stranded on the highway.  $700 to fix.  Vibration in the engine, drivetrain issue the mechanic says.  Stay away from the '98-'00 XC, great look and feel, but 90% chance it will cost you a boatload to keep running.  I was hoping to be that 1 out of 10, but no such luck.  "

around town driving an exercise in

the interior make it necessary to crank 
the stereo.  Once on the highway 
however, the car is very quiet. Dealer 
feels the nature of being a wagon, 
coupled with the amount of aluminum 
used in the build results in chassis  
flex which causes all the rattling. 
Another disappointment is the fuel 
economy. A combination of city/highway 
miles with a conservative driving style 
nets about 19 mpg."

troubles began and Volvo refused to show 
us any ""good will"". The last problem we just 
had, again very expensive repair has left us 
asking-why did we buy a Volvo? Aren't there 
supposed to be great cars? And if this is an

Just change the oil, differential fluid, coolant etc.. I drove it around awhile to make sure it wasn't going to die and after 6 months I replaced the timing belt. Now you know with the AWD system if the tires aren't the same size it will cause premature wear. Buy 4 new tires at the same time. Your taking a chance if you don't. My advice, don't do it. I drive it with the wife and kids 2,000 miles and back stopping frequently to feed children and sleep in hotels. We made it no problem and its still my daily driver.

It has a very good amount of space and some of storage solutions are very good and innovative.  Its had a few issues here and there but if you do your own work and don't mess it up like I did it's not to expensive.  I've heard about trans issues but if your careful it should be fine. Also watch for a clogged oil pick up line, cheap and fairly easy diy or 5-600$ at a dealership. They also can have issues with the rear hatch harness, also easy to fix, I'd recommend leaving the two 90 degree bends in the rear pillar unclipped to keep it from reoccurring.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on the car and it's been incredibly comfy on long drives.  It's not a sports car by any stretch but it can get out of its way. It rides a little firmer than most luxury cars as volvos seem to always do but they do pay off with good road holding. I love this car.
"
volvo,v70,2001,Chris Wade, 12/28/2015,So many problems,1,"This car looks amazing and is a very safe family car. The interior is beautiful and well set up. I did find that some plastic parts broke pretty easily though. I bought this car when it was about six years old. I put very few miles on it but spent a lot of money on repairs. Such a sad car to own especially after years of having great Volvos (1965 122s, 1978 240 wagon) 

The throttle body is a huge issue that costs about $2500 and caused it to intermittently stall.

The heater core leaked due to being a mix of aluminum and plastic. $900

Front suspension was weak, had to replace both A arms

The worst flaw was the transmission. Went out just over 100K and was almost $7000 to repair. At the cost of this I opted to send it to the scrap yard. Car looked great but the repair was more than it was worth. 2001 was known for transmission trouble, this was a lemon year.

volvo,v70,2001,polyas1st, 06/11/2012,"Drives like a car, totes like a UTE",3,"Volvo's are, like most European cars for people who like to drive.
Despite being needlessly burdened with a 4wd system, riding 3"" too high , and having 300lbs of extra weight, this car actually handles competently.
I do my own work on the car so repair costs aren't really an issue but if you had to have it worked on it would be pretty expensive to maintain properly.
 It is certainly more expensive to run than a Kia Sorento which is because it is not a Kia Sorento.

I like the fact that everything is heavy duty, even the leather on the seats is surprisingly thick."
volvo,v70,2001,Katie, 05/11/2016,Volvo saved my family,4,"I bought this car in January for my first Big investment to keep my growing family safe. 
I was sold the car with several things wrong without prior knowledge. The vehicle had an oil leak (pretty significant) and the back wiper blade refused to function along with the back hatch having electrical issues.  
The passenger door just stopped working and the check engine light came on 2 days after buying it due to a ""thermostat"" code. The transmission seems weird at times, almost like it doesn't shift correctly. Mine has the ""slap shift"" option which may have something to do with it? but other than that it has been a really great car. 

This Volvo is a beast in the snow, rain, climbing mountains and handles great in all. 

This vehicle deserves 10 out of 5 stars for safety! I firmly beleive if I was in another vechicle our circumstances would have been much worse. 
We were re-ended in March,  hit so hard that it knocked us into the car in front of us! 
Needless to say my Volvo took the hit like a champion and saved my husband, son, grandmother, and myself from serious injury. 
Sadly it was a total loss to damages, however I will buy another volvo (new year) to replace it!

I just don't enjoy the difficulties that come along with it. 

It drives, mostly, great.
I like the way it handles.
It may be a station wagon, but it's still an interesting car.
The leather interior is miles better than Volvo was using in the 90s.


However, the transmission had to be rebuilt before I even got it off the used dealership lot.
One year later, it struggles to go from 1st to 2nd gear in the morning.
The driver's side control panel on the door works infrequently (so most of the time, my window won't go down and I can't lock the doors remotely).
Mechanic can't find the issue."
volvo,v70,2001,mrsimpson, 07/29/2012,AS EXPECTED AND BETTER!,4,"First, after much review perhaps the XC models have far more problems than the 2.4T V70.
I am at 124,000 and this car is the most comfortable, reliable and all around best car to drive. I also own a 2008 Audi A4, and although the Audi is the prize, I lean more toward driving the Volvo ALL THE TIME! The only issue I had was the radiator modulator going bad, which ran me about 575 dollars and only because my friend is a mechanic! Volvo would have easily been a 1000 plus job! But you know the parts are pricey, find a trusting local guy or do the regular maintenence yourself, it pays!
That said I commute just shy of 90 miles a day and this car runs so smooth it is a pure joy. Also good on gas!"
volvo,v70,2001,Maria, 11/24/2015,Transmission Totally Messed Up,2,"We bought this car a few years ago used, and no less than 10 hours of driving time later the transmission started to get jerky. The car has limped along, with us babying it, but the transmission always gets jerky after 15 minutes of city driving or on hot days. It's been a constant source of stress for us. If you get this year, just get a manual and save yourself the trouble! Glad to finally be getting rid of it-- hopefully our next choice will be a wiser one.

I even drove it up a running river (not very deep) on a camping trip once. It holds my mtn bike if I fold the seats down, and I've slept in it a few times too. Yeah, it's a bit expensive to service and I think it's a little funny looking but I couldn't be much happier with a wagon! Just be sure to stay up on your maintenance because it's way cheaper than repairing something once it breaks."
volvo,v70,2001,Barney, 08/26/2010,Most expensive car I have ever owned,4,"Front end is weak.  Constantly requires repair and replacement of tie- rod-ends, ball joints, constant velocity boots, etc. You name it, it's been replaced, multiple times.  Power window motors, go through them like candy.  Transmission was replaced with 1 mile left in warranty.  Transmission is going again but it lasted 150,000 miles.  Rattles, boy does it ever.  But, it hasn't rusted out and the engine is still strong after 188,000 miles.  Again, I cannot tell you how much this thing has cost to maintain but it's got to be close to the purchase price.

I live in Anchorage, Alaska and decided on the 2 wheel drive model due to my previous XC was a nightmare with repairs.  Drive handling with my 2001 V70 during winter has been pleasant on slippery roads with the normal all weather tires.  The winter tires rubbed against the wheel wells while turning and elected to ditch them.  The lower ground clearance helps with stability with little body roll in turns I've noticed.  Transmission takes a little getting use to for effective use.  I've found when accelerating from a stop it was best to ease on the gas which allowed gears to catch up."
volvo,v70,2001,Backyard Swede Mech, 03/03/2010,Work on it yourself!!!,5,"This is a good car that gets a bad rap.  The tranny has a $19 fix from IPD to fix the hard into and out of 3rd shifts, and missing 3rd all together.  The ETM should be replaced with one from xemodex in Canada.  They have a mod that turns them into a lifetime unit.  Although it is $550.  Those two things will cover 90% of the complaints."

volvo,v70,2001,Will Jennings, 08/04/2006,"Expensive, with dangerous design flaws",2,"At 5 years and 50,000 miles, our 2001 XC70 needed: a new ignition-key tumbler ($600), a new set of rear shocks ($750), which had destroyed a 6 month old set of tires and required their replacement ($650). Lastly, its solenoid transmission design failed while we were on the highway, cutting all power in a critical, dangerous situation. Solution? $3,400 for a new transmission. Together with some minor glitch fixes also not covered by warranty, our 'new car' has cost an avg of $1,250 per year in repairs alone. Proving, once again, you never actually own a Volvo...you just keep paying rent to your mechanic, local towers, and Volvo dealer service. Volvo Customer Care = total fraud."

This was filed in 2002 and is pending. The engine shuts down with no gas pedal response. This is very dangerous. ETM gets carbon deposit buildup. I tried to get Volvo North America customer care to replace this unit because it is a MAJOR design flaw, but they would not. I'm waiting on a decision. It would cost me over $1100 because it is out of warranty. Yet they never sent me any communication while I was under warranty and they knew about this problem.

We've had this car close to two full years now, and although I did some homework going into it, I had no idea just how annoying this vehicle is with regards to repairs.  I like working on cars, but it seemed like every weekend I was out in the garage replacing a bulb, fixing a leak, trouble shooting cryptic error messages.  Ugh.  Final straw was finding out the transmission is going to need replacing, and the engine can't maintain oil pressure.  Least reliable car I've ever owned.

I got it and over a year and a few mo the have put 65,000 miles on it through the worst roads Michigan’s road commission could throw at it.  Bumps, potholes, dirt roads, you name it this car has been great.  It was actually better than my outback in he snow and that’s saying a lot. Maintenance is not cheap but it’s a car and I have a mechanic I trust.  I have done the timing belt, water pump, thermostat, 4 new tires, brakes, control arm bushings, transmission pan gasket.  This car has the most comfortable seats for long journeys of any car I’ve ever been in.


Update:  head gasket finally went at 254,000 miles.  I’m thankful for my time with my Volvo and would do it again if I ever needed a car that big.  It was bought by a mechanic who is turning it into a monster truck.

I bought my V70 XC last year and have had nothing but problems.  Transmission was jerky so I took it to the dealer, only to have it reflashed with no improvement.  While there, they discovered bad trans and engine mounts, leaking angle drive and several broken suspension components.  This is in addition to the $2000 scheduled maintenance, adding up to almost what I paid for this vehicle.  The service and repair history I requested was 34 pages!"

Tell any Volvo mechanic that you own a 2001 Volvo V70 XC and after they stop laughing hysterically, they'll weep for you.
The transmission is going to fail, if it hasn't already. Mine had an oil leak so bad, we named the car ""The Valdez"".
Three weeks after being told that it would cost more to replace the transmission and fix the oil leaks than the car was worth, it blew up on a mountain pass.

Maintenance costs are quite severe and plentiful. After 7 previous volvos all with outstanding reliability, function and longevity it saddens me that a company could transmogrify into producing such a failure of a vehicle.

The car surged and stalled and you never knew when you pulled out into an intersection if the car would hesitate and threaten to stall. Each time I pay for an expensive fix, I decide to just keep the darn thing. Then, of course, another huge repair 6 months later. The most recent problem, a vibration in right front area, is apparently an axle. Last one for me - my husband's toyota costs a whopping $150/year for service/maintenance. Done with Volvo!"

Then literally every electronic and fuel injection component, even the seatbelts started to malfunction.

But c'mon, this is no Honda/Yota.  My Benz that cost 2x as much has 2x the issues and my new BMW has been in the shop more than not, and like my V70, is a first year production model.

BTW, Bosch doesn't make anything that costs less than 200 dollars.  If you plan to keep this car or buy a high mileage Volvo, make sure you have the money in the bank to fix it!

It has incredible mid-range passing capabilities.  If driven under 80 mph on long road trips it will cover 525 miles per tank. The only down side of owning this car, is the tire life on the optional 17"" wheels (20-25K), and they aren't cheap.

So I think that sums it up.  No one will touch this piece of junk and the most bizarre problems occur.  Car has repeatedly been in the shop throughout my ownership, has almost gotten me into many, many accidents due to severe transmission problems, stalling and overheating.  I think I have replaced every part on the car including the engine and transmission and most sensors and they fail again and again.  Now the electrical system and information system is totally messed up.  At this point I could have bought 3 brand new Chevrolets and I'm cutting my losses.  This is also the worst driving car I have ever driven.  It will give someone whiplash with the transmission jerking and lurching.  Not even worth the recycling.  I wouldn't want to curse the other items they might make out of the scrap.  Never buy another Volvo period.  When I see someone driving one, I can't help but pity them.  AND, my model was made in Sweden.  Every repair shop tells me VOLVO is JUNK and the worst nightmares to work on. 
No wonder only Doctors or Lawyers can own them.  They're the only ones who can afford the upkeep.
I do have to say that regardless of how bad it has performed and how costly it has been, in spite of all it's problems and stranding me, it always manages to get me home.  But then again I never drive it more than 25 miles away from home.  I really do think that my Angels have often pushed it safely home.  No thanks to VOLVO.

The turbo engine responds well in a

excellent stability and of course, 
those wonderful seats."
volvo,v70,2001,Dave, 01/10/2005,Volvo Needs to do Better,3,"We've owned the car since new,50k total miles. We've had about a dozen of the electrical problems like others describe, all taken care of under warranty.  Some topics I haven't seen mentioned: Volvo has dropped the ball re several areas of active safety.  There's poor visibility out the rear of the car, even worse at night due to the dim backup lights.  The dash reflects badly in the windshield.  The response of the electronic throttle is different in forward vs reverse, its disconcerting. The HID headlights (have used them on loaner cars)are terrible, standard ones are quite good.  On the other hand, our dealer Mitchell in CT is excellent and actually fairly reasonable in price."

Then, last week, the o-ring failed causing the car to lose all power steering fluid. I had to have it towed the dealer for repair. Yesterday I had to replace all 4 rotors and brake pads at 48,000. The brake pads were originally replaced around 25,000. They assure me that this is typical?! I thought it was unbelievable. I've had many of the other problems reported by others, slipping transmission, service light appearing for no apparent reason, etc., but the brakes are my last straw. This is my 2nd and last Volvo!"

I just took the car in for the 60k mile and was told I also needed to replace inner tie rods, along with some other expensive repair.  I noticed one other reviewer also had to replace. I find this to be ridiculous.  The worst thing, my car jolts, jumps, throttles off and I had the software replacement on the recall.  Last night check engine light on when I just spent $1600 last month at the shop.  This is scary.  I am a loyal Volvo customer, this is my 2nd wagon (last one was 12 yrs old), but I don't think I will purchase another.  The throttle problem is a dangerous one as you don't know when the car is not going to respond?  "

I am on the third main computer module (thankfully under warranty), ABS module ($1000), the throttle module left me stranded hundreds of miles from home.  I've replaced a wheel bearing, power steering problems and countless light bulbs repeatedly.  Easily over $2000 in repairs alone, not including tires, brakes, regular maintenance, etc.  Great when it works, but can no longer trust it!  Will be replaced soon, not Volvo. "

I have driven Volvos for 30 years, 7 new and this one used. I felt confident I had a dependable vehicle. The car performed well until February 2007 when the engine began missing and stalling. My dealer said the engine has failed and is ruined. It is still under warranty but the warranty company refuses to honor it. The car has 75,000 miles on it. I now have no car and it will cost me several thousand to just get it off my hands - I still owe more than the dealer will give me even for a trade in.  I will not be throwing this kind of money at Volvo ever again.  Sad ending to a long friendship w Volvo."

Please save yourself time, money and mental health and buy some other car.  We've had two software updates covered by the recall (I say covered by the recall in that we did not have to pay for the software update, but no one reimbursed us for time, trouble, babysitters, etc).  We've spent $1000 on the abs module and more in just the 2.5 years we've owned the car. We're going today to trade it in on something else.  I've had cars that cost half the price of the Volvo that ran much better and provided much fewer headaches."

This car has been in the shop so many times - bulbs, seat motors, transmissions, electronics, power window lifts, rear hatch, batteries, alternators, voltage regulors, and most recently 1,100 climate control module.  Our favorite was at 70 mph the engine fault sensor shut down the car completely - real hazard!  Only good thing on this entire car is the engine which has given us the least amount of problems."

Very very comfortable to wait for the tow truck in. Every time we get in this car something goes wrong.  We are aware of at least $5000 (no exaggerating!) worth of problems with this car. Absolutely the worst car I've ever owned. We purchased a Volvo for safety and reliability...but stalling at 70mph on the highway with two small children in the dark negates any safety features of this tank. Stay away! We take delivery on our next car (not a Volvo!) tomorrow.  Can't wait to get rid of this bomb!

My check engine light comes on I took it for a obd2 read and they said it was a turbocharger problem. Had that fixed then started having electrical issues up the arse!!! Headlights wouldn't come on the info screen said electrical maintenance required, airbag warning coolant low turn off vehicle warning even though the coolant was topped off . the thing that screwed  seriously up was the transmission it said transmission maintenance required I let the car sit for a week turn it on and then it runs fine until I go down a hill and blow my turbo . that is the day I scrapped it and bought a 1990 240 dl lol never had a problem since

While it does have the most comfortable seats , a decent enough stereo system, and other interior features that are very appealing it has become a glorified enclosed couch sitting in my driveway. How I wish I had read the reviews here before purchasing because I would have changed my mind. I went with it because of the reputation of the company that I knew of in the mid-80's. It lasted a total of 6 days from purchase from a private seller. I noticed that the heater wasn't putting out and checked fluid levels and topped off the radiator. It came home on a rollback: overheated+blown head gasket. Never,ever, again. What a waste!!!"

It is stylish, it's been reliable, and it gets good gas economy for its size.   It runs very well on mid-grad gasoline, runs very smoothly on premium, and runs OK on regular (no pinging, but much less zip). The car is heavy, so acceleration is not the best but is adequate. Get the turbo if you want to take off in a hurry.  My biggest complaint is the lack of Volvo dealers available to service the car. Also,there are some high tech features that become expensive to fix. Even small items are expensive as the parts sources are limited, making trim and accessories expensive. "

Since the car is worth between $5-$6K thats it. The car was a great car to drive. The car just was not reliable. After about 50-60K miles, every trip to the dealer was another $1K bill. Im not talking consumables here but things that have never broken on any car I have ever owned.  (a radio that would change stations every time the car hit a bump or the driver window that fell out of its track twice -after being fixed).

From the interior & exterior design to the performance & fun of driving, the car has an overall feel of real quality & thoughtful engineering. As preventative maintenance, I changed the timing belt (incl. tensioner & pulley) & water pump after the purchase; also put in a new cabin air filter.

has been remarkably reliable and 
(almost) trouble free. The dealership 
(Volvo of Pleasanton, CA) has a 
fantastic sales staff and a horrible 
service department. I have had to 
actually argue with the Service 
Manager on 2 different occasions. I 
would recommend buying your Volvo in 
Pleasanton but having it serviced 
elsewhere. A previous review 
complained of front suspension 
problems, I experienced some of the 
same. However, it was repaired and has 
been fine since. The traction 
abilities of this car are remarkable! 
It's almost as though it's on rails.

acceleration."

At 15 - 18 average MPG, the 247 
HP of this car comes at a pretty steep 
price.  The depreciation on the car in 
terms of dollars per month or year is 
VERY HIGH too.  Our family has been

friends in Sweden that Volvo actually 
provided reprogrammed chips to V70 T5 
owners because the 2.4T outperformed 
the T5.  From the very beginning, we 
have had a number of problems related 
to poor quality control.  Interior trim 
on the A-post fell off the first month 
we had it.  Over 10 bulbs have burned 
out.  The dealer has replaced them 
without charge up until now, but it 
still means we have to take the car in 
frequently.  The biggest problem was 
complete transmission failure at 60,000

fix it.  We have about 28k miles on it

they should last.  "
volvo,v70,2001,italophile, 02/28/2003,No regrets!,4,"We purchased this car used.  It had 6K 
miles on it, and had been used as a 
rental.  We bought it at significant 
savings, and because it had been used 
for part of the year, we were able to 
get the ""extended warranty"" for 
certified used cars.  

We have never had to invoke any 
warranty repair.  The car has 
performed beautifully.  The mileage is 
impressive for such a large car.  
Plenty of pick up to be had without 
the Turbo.  Having previously driven a 
compact car, I can tell you I had no 
trouble adjusting to this one.  It is 
easy to maneuver."

replacement, two headlights replaced, 
and transmission replaced all within 
first 28,000 miles.  Just looked into 
trading this in and the depreciation is 
horrible - car is worth $19500 after 3

we were never interested in the whole 
SUV thing. (Do I even need to mention 
the ""M"" word?) It wasn't until I spoke 
to a friend who had a photograph of the 
next generation Volvo wagons that I put 
my purchase on hold. Talk about a dream 
come true. The T5 has it all - amazing 
looks, horsepower to spare, incredible 
handling and control, and it is perhaps 
the most comfortable car I've ever had 
the pleasure of driving. Given the 
choice of a huge engine or XC, I went 
with the engine - and am very happy I 
did. "
volvo,v70,2001,Bandit1, 01/06/2005,Worst driving car I've ever owned,3,"We had a 1998 S70 and loved it so much that we decided to 'upgrade' to a 2001 V70 T5.  What a mistake. I hate driving this car.  The adaptive transmission never reacts the way you want it to.  When you come to a stop, the transmission shifts to neutral (fuel saving feature). But when you're ready to go, you have to wait for the car to get back in gear before you start moving. Dealership has reprogrammed the transmission 3 times with no improvement.  Press the accelerator and nothing happens. Press it more, and the car lurches forward.  Volvo customer service told me ""we sell lots of cars so it must not be a problem.""  LAST VOLVO I'LL EVER OWN."
volvo,v70,2001,Ginger, 01/07/2005,Volvo XC Not after the warranty,4,"I bought this vehicle in its 3rd model year and it had all kinds of kinks.  Under warranty all of these issues were free ($6000 worth), but note that I sold the vehicle as soon as the warranty was up.  Loved driving it; impeccable customer service and reasonable service prices but am not willing to pay for unreasonable problems.//I have 2 labradors and an infant who go with me everywhere.  This vehicle has the space of a midsized SUV and somehow handles the road like my tiny 325i BMW.//With the car seat installed behind the passenger seat there is little room left up front--in that configuration, my husband is 6' and refuses to ride in the passenger seat as his knees are up in the dashboard"

I do not think of it as a station wagon, more a serious sports wagon. Rides like it is on rails.  Car seems to like high speeds.  Replaced original Pirelli's with Michelin's to reduce road noise. Car is now a whisper on the highway. Bought extended warranty which took care of some issues with suspension linkages.  Service at Keystone Volvo is gold standard. "

Difficult radio set up, bulky A- pillars and out of place cheap plastic touches.  The ride is detached for cars in this price range, light bulbs blow more often than you need fuel.  The tranny went at 30K forcing an extended warranty purchase.  Local Volvo dealer provides exceptional service at a price you would expect with this class of car.  The car is far too noisey for this class.  With 100k just around the corner a new Volvo is not out of the question although better cars in this price range exist."

I have to say that (arguably) though looks have improved, quality control has not.  Sure my V70 looks top notch, but I've had multiple issues with the car from the brakes to the ETM to the suspension.  All of these problems are not cheap to fix, ranging from $700-1200 a visit.  It seems that Volvo dropped the ball on their 2001 line of V70's, and they're not considering any recalls.  You'll find many owners having the same problems: ETM gives out while driving at highway speeds, the clunk felt when starting up from a stopped position, the brake rotors needing replacement every 20K miles, etc."

Thank god I purchased the VIP warranty.  Took it in for the $700 60K service (!) and mentioned a knocking sound from the suspension and also a bad oil leak.  They found knocking was result of broken sway bar connectors and a broken engine mount (over $700 in repairs), and the oil leak was from the engine block itself, and may require replacement of the whole engine!!! They have had car for over a week. This was after replacing a seal on the turbo return ($150 repair) on the previous service.

volvo,v70,2001,JesseFerraro, 09/04/2004,Volvo rocks!,4,"Volvos have been produced by swedish 
engineers whose soul purpose was to 
make a vehicle that would ultimately 
save your life. That was over 2 decades 
ago, since then they have layered 
comfort, reliability, handling, 
practicality and power upon the one 
thing that singles out Volvo from the 
rest: your Safety.  The Volvo xc-70 
turbo brought volvo into a dimension of 
automobile ingenuity. Riding this car 
in about a foot of powder in Utah, I 
almost felt as if I were on a 
snowmobile. Stopping short in snow, I 
wouldn't slide for more than a foot (at 
speeds of 20-40 mph). Lets not forget 
about its 220hp that leaves most sports 
cars in the dust! Volvo rocks!"

drive! No real mechanical problems, a
turbo boost sensor went out, but
replaced under warranty.  Just returned
from a 1200 mile road trip to Yosemite.
 I loved driving through the mountains.
 I can't wait to test drive a new AWD
T5.  The 2001 stereo is lacking, radio
signal pick-up is moderate at best & I
had to have the CD changer replaced
twice (warranty).  San Diego Volvo is
very good to deal with."

Comfortable, good power + mileage (28-29)  City driving is sluggish and poor mileage (17-19). Lack low end torque so the car lacks pickup. Manual shifting stick or autostick allows the driver to correct of mismatched auto shift + RPM torque setting. Poor turing radius.  For our style of driving, we'll go with the 2.5T next time.  Reliability has been ok. Both headlight + various position/brake lights burned out once. The bulbs are cheap and very easy to replace. Front light lens assembly is a single unit (glass) and cost $300 for parts when chipped. Get ipd's plastic lens protector."

It's a beautiful car, but the reliability of the newer Volvos leaves a lot to be desired.  We've had transmission problems from almost day one.  It's a certified car, so that was our only saving grace.  We had to have several software upgrades for the transmission, and the last time it was in, I was told that if this didn't ""fix"" the problem, I would be the proud owner of a new transmission on a vehicle with 65,000 miles on it.  My independent mechanic told me to avoid all Volvo's newer than 99 until they work out the bugs.  I'll stick with my 240."

volvo,v70,2001,gm in TX, 12/24/2004,Love this wagon!,5,"I bought the Volvo after driving guzzlers --  a Suburban and a Sequoia. What sold me, however, was the built in booster seats for my kiddos.  (They can get in and out and buckle all by themselves now, and no more lugging around big booster seats!)  It is very smooth, quick and super in the rain.  My brakes squeak because the dealer replaced them when I bought them with cheaper ones than volvo would have.  My husband, who is an SUV man, actually loves driving this car."
volvo,v70,2001,Oklahoma, 01/25/2005,"It does have some issues, but not bad",4,"This car is very pleasant to drive, people compliment its looks all the time, and I feel safe in it.  There have been annoying minor problems but the dealers have been gracious about replacements of parts w/warranty.  Minor light bulbs, the mechanical cupholder, and the fuel door have all had to be replaced.  I'm careful about maintenance, Mobil 1 every 4000 miles. It has hauled furniture and teenagers with room to spare, and is excellent for long road trips."

However, I have had too many problems...suspension parts, rubber bushings, brake booster, light bulbs, turn signal relay switch have been replaced in a 12 month period.  My previous Toyota 4runner I drove for 5 years and not one single problem.  I had the opportunity to drive a Toyota while my Volvo was being repaired and I will say that even with the constant little troubles, the Volvo's ride, performance, and craftsmanship are way above the Japanese and American cars I have owned in the past.  Conclusion....even with the little problems, I still love my Volvo."

This car is great on the highway and on dirt roads.  The car has power, hugs the road during rain, and is fun to drive.  After road trips, I'm ready to do things.  Great seats!  The interior and exterior color scheme is excellent. Good to look at and functional.  No sunlight reflecting off of the dashboard. Nice leather stitching and interior combinations.  Great sound system.  Just a good car."

At first the problems were minor and under warranty, so it wasn't any big deal. But we have an extended warranty but it wouldn't cover the $1000 throttle that went out.  Our volvo dealership indicates that it's common for the throttle to go out and this was at less than 60K miles.  We won't buy another one and I'm hoping to get rid of this one before anything else goes wrong!  These are too overpriced for all the maintenance that is required."

I have had no problems in over a year (except for headlights which every time my dealership has replaced within 5 minutes and given me for free).  This car drives like a dream in the city and is awesome on long car trips.  I do not get the kind of mileage the reviews say (18 city, 25 hwy) I average 21.7 in the city and over 26 on the highway!  Way to go Volvo!"

He was rushed to the hospital but walked away five hours later with a bad seat belt bruise and a cut from his sunglasses. The car did not survive and I've already bought a new Volvo to replace it. We bought this car at 5 yo and 65000 miles. Got a great deal, local family had all the service records. Besides being in the lightbulb of the month club, there was one issue with the throttle module that was replaced under warranty and never acted up again. We had the car for 12000 miles and only had to change the oil changed and replace two light bulbs. Man, do I miss that car!"

I bought it used less than 3 years ago, and since then it seems as though something or another is constantly breaking:  ABS module ($900); outside temperature sensor; turbo boost sensor; body and interior hardware; a/c blower; fuses blowing; you name it.  I love the comfort, the looks and the cargo room, but it's wearing me out. "
volvo,v70,2001,Allison, 08/19/2007,Too bad,3,"We bought this car because my husband has always had Volvos.  Well he'd never had one like this! We've had major repairs that have cost big money. From the turbo clip, to the gas cover, to a transmission update ($1400!) which didn't fix the problem. We were just told the transmission is about to go so we have to get out from under this money pit. In a little over a year we have spent close to $3000. It looks like 60,000 is the magic mileage for this Volvo. Once you hit that, be prepared to have it in the shop every three months."
volvo,v70,2001,skipb, 08/31/2007,Shock and Awe.,3,"This car has ruined our brand loyalty to Volvo (having previously owned and been very happy with an 84 DL wagon, an 84 GL sedan, an 88 740 wagon, a 93 850 sedan, and a 97 850R sedan), and as a result we probably will not be buying another. We have already spent well over 5K replacing items that should never need replacing (the radiator, 4 or 5 control modules, etc.), and now we are facing a 5K transmission replacement at 94K miles. The dealer is sympatheic, as is Volvo of America, but is otherwise totally unresponsive. It's a shame, but it's time for us to explore another brand."

almost 2 years.  Still love car, except 
for minor problems faced by 
others. ""Upgraded"" Pirelli tires SUCK - 
tire performance average and durability 
terrible - replaced three tires that 
developed ""bulges"", repaired many leaks 
and they are almost worn out after 27K 
miles. Mechanical dash cupholder broke. 
Finally, thanks to ""daytime running 
lights"" that leave all the lights on 
all the time, bulbs burn out often - 
replaced a headlight, turn signal and 
brake light. Still, these problems 
minor and tire issue will go away after 
Pirellis replaced once and for all.

shop eight times in two years. Five 
bulbs have burned out, and not 
because of daytime running lights 
either, as turn signal and brake lights 
also burned out. The service 
department just states that this 
happens. Unfortunately, the most 
crashworthy car is not very safe when 
you are driving around out of town at

volvo,v70,2001,Railfan, 03/24/2002,My Wife's Car,4,"On Nov. 03 of 2001, my wife and I purchased or second Volvo.  The first 
was a new 1988 740 Turbo (which still runs as well as the day we drove it
home).  As the '88 was approaching 14 years of age, we thought that a newer
vehicle should transport both my wife and son.  My wife spotted her soon-to-
be-new car on the dealer's lot of Bozzani Volvo (Covina, CA) when, one day
she dropped the '88 740 off for its usual servicing.  As she was walking through
the lot, she spotted the 2001 Cross Country (dark blue) and, in short, the rest
is history.  To those who report that the Volvo is the next best thing to a tank,
we agree.  "
volvo,v70,2001,Volvo Dave, 04/02/2002,Nearing Perfection,5,"I would argue that no car is perfect... yet the new Volvo wagon is nearing the unattainable. I have been driving my T5 for twenty-one months, and simply adore it. 

My recommendations to anyone considering the V70 wagon would be as follows: 

1) Get the turbo. I see people in my rear view mirror with their jaw in their lap as I pull away from a red light. This car is fast. 

2) Get the 17"" Pirelli tires. I'm not one for tricked out cars, but these make the car look HOT and keep you on the road. 

That's about it. I can't wait to upgrade to the new wagon, due out in a year or so with an even bigger engine. Someone at Volvo needs a nice pat on the back!!!"
volvo,v70,2001,wjbean, 05/11/2020,"A good solid, and yes, fun ride.",4,"I have a ""downstream"" O2 sensor issue. Other than that, the car is solid. It handles as responsively and crisply as the day it came off the assembly line, and with the Turbo, the performance is quite good.
This is an interesting mashup of vehicle types. It's a wagon for utility, has a lot of luxury features, and is fun to drive. A sport luxury wagon?

volvo,v70,2002,MaineTrees, 01/07/2009,Fabulous and Fun V70,4,"After 4 years and 50K+ miles I still love this car.  It is a joy to drive. Seat comfort is superb. I can drive for hours with no back ache.  Braking system is superb. This is the non-turbo model and has plenty of pep with the 5 speed auto transmission.  32 MPG highway at 70 mph. About 22-23 in the city.  Repairs and scheduled maint are expensive at the dealer!! Find a good independent garage and stick to the maintenance schedule.  You will save lots of $$. Change the trans fluid every 40K miles, the claimed lifetime trans fluid interval is baloney.  The cost of a new tranny will make you cry! "
volvo,v70,2002,run4fun12, 11/04/2008,Eats Wheel Bearings,4,"This car has had 6 wheel bearing replacements in 130,000 miles. Spoke of record with an engineer at bearing supplier. Said the bearings are not adequate for parts of North American market.  Inner wheels fill with mud and harden creating vibration when driving. I don't recommend this car if you live or travel on dirt roads."
volvo,v70,2002,sadvolvoowner, 12/22/2015,Totally expected,1,"Owner of this car for four years now. Little over 80k on the car when purchased. Around 120k, 130 k the instrument cluster failed. I bought the part, but Volvo & the mechanic seem to have an excuse everytime we try to get the car in to replace it. 

The car has a new timing belt and steering column -and other parts too numerous to name. The car is in the shop 2 -3 times a year. 

Although this is a very safe car and I feel safe in it, it is a money pit.

Do not buy a Volvo unless you enjoy throwing your money away! All the electronic components will fail.

Your best option if you want a Volvo is to buy a really old one with no digital components.

Good luck!!!"
volvo,v70,2002,Tim, 09/09/2007,Buyer Beware!!!,2,"We bought this car with 32k miles on it in 2004. We bought a certified pre- owned Volvo which extended the warranty to 100,000 miles. It cost $1,500 extra (at least that's what the dealer said). I'm glad that we got the extended warranty because we needed it approximately 12-15 times in 3 years of ownership for major repairs. I've never had so many problems with any car that I've ever owned. Most of the problems were related to vaious sensors on the car and the car went into sort of a limp mode on 2 or 3 occasions which reallty caused a lot of worry about getting stranded on the side of the road. We got rid of it and bought a new Toyota Sienna. Volvo is by far the worst car I've ever owned."
volvo,v70,2002,KxVx, 03/24/2009,I love my VOLVO!,5,"I purchased my Volvo because I was familiar with the reliably of the brand, as my first car was a 240 DL. I've been very happy with it, and it gets great gas mileage for a car with such get-up-and-go."

years and would not buy another.  Have 
had a series of electrical problems -- 
bulbs constantly shorting out, 
headlights failing -- and other 
assorted problems.  Service has been 
mediocre and overpriced.  Sport tires 
are expensive and loud -- not a quiet

10 years now and recently bought an

Bought used with 50K miles two weeks ago. This car has great power, but don't punch the accellerator unless you really mean it. Has every safety feature available on any new car and a superb stereo. The gas tank is ridiculously big; driven from Memphis to DC (around 850 miles) on less than two tanks of gas. Lots of thoughtful features on mine: integrated second row child boosters; built-in second row tray table with cup holders; built-in cargo compartment divider; clever rear-facing third row seats that my kids adore; electronic child-proof door locks."

I know I'm driving them around not only in comfort buy Safe. We all love it. My husband doesn't usually like to drive but since we bought this V70 we have made trips up to ten hours and I tell you what an experience. I wish everyone could drive this car. "
volvo,v70,2002,wagon lover, 01/11/2007,works for me,4,"Even with a few glitches, I'd rather drive this sporty European wagon than any of its bland Japanese or American competitors, and none of them can hold five kids.  Bought used last winter.  Had a few gremlins in front suspension, but local dealership did great job of diagnosing and fixing.  No problems since then after 10k miles city driving.  No complaints about dealer service, but not cheap.  Car is fun to drive; handles beautifully on turns, accelerates quickly, and cruises smoothly at supra-legal highway speeds.  Not that I drive like that.  Big turning radius hasn't been an issue.  Lots of features, marvelous seats, and a kickin' stereo make long drives a pleasure."
volvo,v70,2002,Volvo Saved My Life, 02/20/2007,Love My Volvo,5,"After my prior Volvo V70 AWD wagon was squashed by a truck that went airborne on top of it, and I lived through it, I had to have another one.  I went out of state to get a rare combo, V70 with AWD (not an XC) plus the nav system.  I have been extremely happy with this car, my 4th Volvo.  The nav system rises up out of the dash, so you don't have to take your eyes off the road.  It's great on snow and ice, with amazing braking power, it's gorgeous, and it gets good gas mileage.  You have to keep it in alignment, or the AWD will go through tires.  It's also a little too polite about letting you know you're low on gas.  Keep it aligned and gassed up and you'll love this car. "

Super comfortable front seats. Back seats to narrow and not enough leg room especially if the driver has long legs like mine (I am 6'2""). Great car stereo. Great horn. Great brake system, very safe car. The 2.5 is and adequate engine, altough I recommend T or superior engine if you like a better picup. Very elegant!!"
volvo,v70,2002,smujmu, 10/04/2004,Great Wagon but no room for carseats,4,"Purchased this wagon with 3rd row 
seat.  A dream to drive on a 2500 
cross country trip - no driver fatigue 
as seats are very comfy.  No repair 
issues to date.  My one complaint as a 
mother of young children is the 
difficulty in installing a third 
carseat or booster.  GET THE 
integrated booster seats.  Back seat 
has little leg room - no a biggie for 
hauling kids, but seating and seatbelt 
spacing in middle position is narrow 
making it just about impossible to fit 
a 3rd carseat in back seat.  You 
cannot use child restraint in 3rd 
seat.  We did not opt for the 
integrated booster seats - and found 
they area VERY expensive to add in 
later."

cargo area holds a ton of stuff.  I 
traded in my '89 240DL that, once I 
quit going to the dealer for service,

appreciated in the T5 as the side 
bolsters are much better than the 
standard seats (just take a curve 
quickly in a v70 with standard seats

very decent deal for $500 extra

to driving. Although a mid-size wagon, 
once inside, you are never reminded of 
that fact. It handles in a very 
responsive way and if anything, is a 
bit too peppy. You MUST use the cruise 
control or you will be driving on a

We now have to replace the radiator which has a slow leak. We have to now replace the steering rods and bushings.I have never had to replace steering rods at 57K miles on any of my past cars. There are a few other things that happened from day one that were never properly taken care of.  I  believe that Volvo should at least offer to help cover the expenses.

However at 101,000 miles the transmission must be completely replaced at a cost almost equal to the entire trade in value. At 7 years old, with this mileage, I no longer have a warranty, and will probably donate the car to charity. I love the car but think that maintenance costs have been excessive over the four years I have owned it. I probably won't buy another Volvo, but if I do I will get rid of it before the warranty runs out."

had this car, but I really am enjoying 
it. Previous car was a 00' BMW 328, so 
my standards are high.

The interior is nicely laid out with a 
feel of quality and quiteness to the 
cabin. Like one of my friends said "" 
its like driving a pillow"". 
Unfortunately, the cabin is 
so ""airtight"" that when you do open 
the moonroof it does make a vibrating 
noise. 

One compliant: When shifting the 
automatic transmission, its wishy 
washy...you have to be sure that its 
really in reverse rather than neutral."

This car is much safer.  We love the

perfect height, the seat belts don't 
cut into the kids necks as they did in

drives and handles great. My wife has

is very comfortable, especially on long 
trips.  Volvo has added many features 
to the car including the rain sensor 
which works very well.  The car is 
child friendly and can take three child 
seats accross the middle seat with 
ease.  My car is equipped with the 
reverse radar assist and it works very 
well.  Recommend this option if you 
either park in close quarters or have 
little children.  If you take this 
option, you should also install the 
module which will mute the radio."

THUD when closing and we feel secure 
even in the heaviest weather.  Our '97

The car handles very well, it is esthetically pleasing, gets good gas mileage, and has great storage.  The main complaint is with a cold-start problem.  The car would not start at temperatures below about 30 - 35F.  Frustratingly ironic for a Swedish car. Left us stranded once.   Eventually, Volvo tracked the problem down to a faulty engine control module after a few repair attempts. Since then, we've had no complaints. Would probably buy another."

very satisfied.  I was in the market 
for an SUV..but after looking at the 
V70 decided it really had everything I 
was looking for-versatility, styling, 
safety, and cargo space!  Mine has the 
integrated booster seats-great idea.  
This car has the most comfortable seats 
I've ever known in a car-plus heated!!

the quality, ride, comfort, and styling 
are super!  Best looking station wagon 
on the market today.  The seats are 
very comfortable.  When driving you are 
unaware that this is a station wagon.  
Almost got a Passat station wagon (I 
have a Passat sedan that I am very 
happy with), however worked a deal with 
the Volvo that put me only $2,000 over 
the Passat wagon, plusthe Volvo had 
many more features.  Feels much more 
solid than the Passat."
volvo,v70,2003,Chicago Matt, 05/22/2003,A Good Solid Car,4,"I have owned this car for about three 
months.  It spends most of its time in 
the city, where it does very well.  
Where it really shines, however, is on 
the highway.  We took a 2,000 mile trip 
and it was amazing - comfortable, 
smooth, quiet and fun to drive in the 
mountains.  On the highway, I got 28 
mpg.  In town, it is closer to 16 mpg 
(all stop and go).

The acceleration makes it fun to 
drive.  The brakes are awesome.

I would recommend this car to anyone 
looking for a solid, high-quality and 
versatile people and stuff mover (who 
doesn't want an SUV or minivan)."
volvo,v70,2004,donalan, 04/06/2016,Bumpy Beauty,4,"We own a 2004 V70 T2.5 AWD Wagon and we like it a lot.  Plain looking on the outside but not dower.  Inside the materials all look pretty good after 12 years and 188k miles.  Acceleration is a strong point while handling is capable but the bumps from the road transmit jolts and noise to passengers inside - not a luxury ride.  In fact its bumpier and noisier inside than most non-luxury cars.  That said its not terrible just not a smooth ride.  

Seats are well crafted and very comfortable.  The rear leg room is limited for a family car.  My kids are now in their teens and we will need a car with a bigger back seat - not fair to sentence anyone over 5'6"" to a long car ride in the rear of this vehicle.  We can get another 5"" of rear seat leg room in a Toyota Highlander.  Storage is ample and the cargo capacity is excellent for a car.  We can still pack for a 2 week vacation without a roof rack.  

Reliability has been pretty good for a car this age.  We did have a radiator failure that leaked coolant into the transmission (and transmission fluid into the radiator) - that could have been catastrophic if we had not caught it immediately (e.g. driven it for more than a few miles in that condition).  Otherwise its been struts, engine mounts, 02 sensors, brakes etc - all normal wear and tear over 12  yrs 188k mi.

Oil level was checked after first warning light flash...full!

Although the interior isn't as luxurious as my old Audi, it does the job just fine and when considering how much faster this thing is, I'll take performance over interior any day.
There truly is no other station wagon with this type of power and handling that comes in a six-speed anymore. Add in AWD and we're talking about a car that can go anywhere."
volvo,v70,2004,Meadow, 08/05/2010,Truly a lemon,3,"We've driven a lot of Volvos over the years, and the 2004 has the worst reliability by far.  We're very disappointed that we had to replace the radiator and rack and pinion steering at 82,000 miles.  These were very expensive to replace, and there's no reason that either should have failed before 100K miles.  Currently the steering wheel buttons that control the stereo are frozen.  The gas gauge also swings wildly from 1/3 full to empty when the vehicle is low on fuel.  This car is a heap of problems."
volvo,v70,2004,J. M., 11/02/2016,"It's not cool, but it's certainly utilitarian.",5,"This is a fantastic all-around vehicle. It's big and comfy enough for a normal person, can haul whatever you need, can tow as much as a small truck (3300lbs), gets 30mpg on the highway (25mpg mixed), and is fun to drive (5 speed manual transmission.) I'm a Volvo enthusiast, so my opinion is slightly biased. I got this wagon for a really good deal because it needed some body work. I performed the necessary repairs and have put ~67,000 miles on it in a little over 4 years. Parts are relatively inexpensive if you shop online. Places like FCPEuro and EEuroParts have mostly everything in stock and have fair pricing. RockAuto has a lot of stuff, too. There are several dedicated Volvo forums that cover just about every repair possible. I will continue to drive it and upkeep it until the wheels fall off. It's a very useful, all around good vehicle.
November 4th, 2020 - the car now has 230k miles on it and is still going strong. It’s still the best vehicle that I’ve ever owned.

But this V70 is just phenomenal! No repairs! It has air bags everywhere even in the pillars so curtain airbags will inflate if you're in a side impact- very safe! We like the power off the line that this car offers and nimble steering although it's a luxury car- great for tireless trips w/ the extremely comfortable seats. Upgraded to IPD swaybars & HD endlinks as well as a drop in K&N air filter. I knew these would make a difference in performance even before I bought the car...and well worth it!

Lexus in superior to all ever owned in 
build quality, when it comes to a road 
trip we always take the Volvo as one 
can drive long hours and still arrive 
feeling fresh and relaxed.  I often go 
out to the Volvo to do my reading as 
the seats are more comfortable than my

My only gripe with this car is funny 
things happen i.e light bulbs burn out

the electric door locks don't work 
then the high beams don't work, then 
out of nowhere they start to work

period, break-downs became more and 
more frequent.  So I thought I would 
give Volvo a second chance.  I got a 
2004. I have less than 1000 miles on my 
2004 and it is in the shop with a major 
problem.  Unless you have a butler that 
can spend his time driving back and

choose another manufacturer."

to be ""red"".  The only comparable 
vehicle from my perspective is the Audi 
S6 Avant.  The ""R"" is a much better 
value. The build quality 
is ""outstanding"".  The styling is a bit 
understated, but there are some very 
unique ""R"" touches that make it 
standout.  I considered Audi A6 Avant, 
Audi Allroad, and VW Passat W8 wagons 
but felt the V70R was the best in the 
group based on performance, cargo 
capacity, features, color, and overall 
uniqueness (500 to be built).

There is no substitute...  If you can 
track down a V70R or a dealer with a 
open allocation, I suggest you move 
quickly because there are only 499 
left! "
volvo,v70,2004,Florida tennisplayer, 09/03/2003,Three shortcomings on 2004 Volvo V70,3,"My Volvo V70's worst, and potentially 
dangerous feature, is the tilt of the 
windshield.  The top of the windshield 
is reflected in the window, making it 
very, very difficult to see the road 
when the sun hits the windshield at a 
certain angle.  

Second worst feature is the curve of 
the hood which does not permit the 
driver to see where the car ends.  The 
hood just disappears and you have no 
idea how much room there is between the 
front of the car (or the right hand 
side of the car) and a wall or other 
object.  

These two items represent very poor 
design.

Thirdly, on several occasions the car 
doors locked accidentally while driving."

What a great car!  Very stylish, very fast (my other cars are Jag and BMW coupes) and this no sacrifice in the performance department, especially for a wagon.  But, it's so comfortable to drive and gets great gas mileage 17/28 compared to 9/14 for my Explorer. I can't imagine why anyone who doesn't absolutely NEED the extreme size of an SUV (hear that all you soccer moms?) wouldn't get a Volvo wagon instead.

advantages:

vs 540 wagon:  540 has no manual tranny,
and the V70R has a nicer/larger interior.
The 540 is also miserable in the snow

fantastic.  It sticks to the road in 
all weather and at all speeds.  Never 
any wheel spin -- it just digs in and 
goes like a bat out of hell.  15k so 
far and no service issues."

less than 3-months.During that time I
have had an opportunity to get to know
my ""R"".My first impression was,nice -
styling,but what else does it do?
It didn't take me long to find out!!!
From it's sumptious interior to it's
""G""Force acceleration this is one Heck
of a station wagon!!!



After Looking over from one-end to 
another,I
finally got in for a test drive.That
30-minute test drive sold me on this
vehicle.What began as infatuation has
turned into a full fledge love affair!
Each day I drive this car I like it
just a little bit more!"

addition, Volvo's world renown

on the market.  It is also one of the 
best cars on the market.  There are 
not many manual-transmission wagons on 
the market.  Great engine, great AWD 
and the 6-speed is one of the best 
I've ever used.  The interior 
(Atacama) has gotten so many 
compliments I have long since lost 
count.  The replacement for my 2001 
Acura MDX was going to be this or the 
Infiniti FX35 and the decision really 
came down to exclusivity.  While the 
FX is a phenomenal car, there are too 
many of them.  I can count the number 
of Volvo Rs I've seen on two hands.  
It also has a great sound system and 
an awesome adjustable suspension!"

up 2003 Passat Wagon GLS 5 speed,

We love the comfort, luxury, and style 
of the V70. Although not a powerhouse, 
the engine is strong in midrange power, 
and the smooth auto transmission is a 
perfect match for the powerband.

The kids love the 3rd row jump seats,

Why would anyone spend $30,000+ on an 
ungainly, ill-handling SUV when they 
could have a sporty, fine handling

volvo,v70,2004,bart, 09/07/2006,V70R- bargain performance,4,It's a great car and a great highway cruiser but ditch the stock tires which only last 15K and get some pilots.  I had an audi allroad before which had better build quality but the v70r seats are the best in the industry and the mileage is much better here.  the ride is rough.

I find myself at work looking forward to the weekend, when I get to drive it.  As with any Volvo, it's a tank.  The brakes are normally quite good, but the V70R brakes stop on half a dime.  It feels like it has a lot more than the rated 300 HP.  My Boss's S6 wagon just doesn't match it.  We have the orange leather interior, which pushes it over the edge to PHAT.  Or at least as phat as a Volvo can ever be.  A little part of me died when Volve announced this year that they were discontinuing it.  "

volvo,v70,2005,dsensing, 12/20/2008,Excellent all-round wagon,4,"We bought our '05 V70 from a friend who had put 93K business miles on it. All services done at Volvo dealer & all records present, two repairs & neither mechanical/automotive. Its Consumer Reports' reliability ratings are actually higher than our son's Infiniti! Standard engine has all the power we need for a wagon. V70 was based on the S80 platform, so much more back seat room than my '05 S60. Great hauling room in back; if you don't want a SUV but need that, this car is for you. Front seats are best in the world, bar none. Auto-wipers are great! 3-position memory seat is great since my wife & daughter & I drive it. Maintenance not expensive if you have a good non-Volvo shop (we do)."
volvo,v70,2005,Vince, 04/22/2006,Serves many different needs comfortably,5,"This is our second Volvo and we've been pleased with both. More nimble handling than expected with the 17"" wheels, lots of cargo space, comfortable to sit in and drive. I'm 6'4"" and don't feel cramped. Great car for the children with integrated booster seats and third seat. Good fuel mileage -- average 27.5 combining highway, city, over hill and dale. Mechanically very sound. When started, engine revs to about 1500 rpm for about 10 seconds before decreasing to normal idle of about 700 rpm -- told this was to warm engine faster to improve emissions. "

volvo,v70,2005,R2D2, 10/01/2009,Swedish Dragon Wagon,4,"This much fun ought to be illegal.  The V70R is the perfect stealth wagon.  Who would expect 0-60 in the mid-5s from a station wagon?  With the available aftermarket items (exhaust, sway bars, and engine computer kits), getting 350+ HP is very do-able from only 2.5 liters.  The 6-speed manual and brembo brakes make this a pleasure to drive.  With 04 and 05 models coming within pricing reach, now is the time to think swede."
volvo,v70,2005,rmo3, 10/10/2011,120K still drives as new and looks great a great car,4,"I have my 2005 since purchased almost new as a loaner with a 2K on the odo. It is my daily driver kids to school and to work and road miles. I drive more than average abut 25K a year. There have been no major maintenance issues, I did replace a/c at 100k live in FL runs 24/7 here. I had a g tires, brakes, fluids changes and (timing belt at 105K). Dealer service can be expensive but you should follow the maintenance schedule and make sure the last owner did if you are buying high mileage. The
vehicle still rock solid gets 25 MPG. Still has a top speed of 130 mph, so those SUV's might pass you with 400 hp but know this the V70 is faster than all of them they are ltd. to 110 :)."
volvo,v70,2005,Davek, 08/20/2005,A truly great car!!!,5,"This is our 3rd Volvo.  We had over a quarter of a million miles on our 1st Volvo (270,000 miles) and it ran perfectly when we sold it.  We drove our 2nd Volvo over 18 years.  When we traded it in on this 2005 model, the older Volvo ran just as well as the day we drove it off of the showroom floor 18 years ago.  This new 2005 V70 is the best of the 3.  It's a stylish wagon with lots of power (much more than we've had in the past).  It handles superbly.  Exceptional fuel mileage (34mpg highway) and just has a very solid feel to it when you drive it.  We especially like the smooth ride.  Our children like the extra room and comfort of the rear seat area."
volvo,v70,2005,D. Sensing, 07/31/2008,Better than I thought it would be,4,"I bought my car with 93K miles on it from a friend and have put several K miles on it since. The most outstanding feature? Gas mileage! I get 36-plus on the i'state and 29 combined using prem. gas, not so much with regular. The wagon is a great hauler and the reason we bought the car. Very useful cargo space and rear seats fold very easily. Don't mind not having turbo motor; the standard engine has enough power for our needs. All in all an outstanding auto, especially for the price I paid, trade-in value! "
volvo,v70,2005,Mike, 04/03/2010,Still Going,4,"I have had this V70 car for 92,000 miles. I still drives as new. Only repairs were to a frozen gear shift and head lights started to glaze but were replaced under warranty. Maintenance has been below normal, brake pads, oil, and flush fluids at normal intervals. Volvo dealer maintenance is less expensive than premium brands but I have spent four figures there at least twice. The result in keeping the car up is a 10 year driver, six years in it really shows no wear of any significance. My last Ford Explorer and Sable were well worn by now on the last go around. Wife has S60 same engine her car is bullet proof also. For people who want  cars for longevity go with the base 5cyl eng."
volvo,v70,2005,micron26, 02/03/2005,the ultimate in stealth high performance,4,"It's incredibly versatile with ample space and the 4C suspension setup, and has tremendous performance in third and fourth gear. Lag is noticeable at low RPM, particularly in first and second gear, but very few cars of any stripe can stay with this one once it gets going. It also boasts the best (support, comfort) seats I've ever sat in (my wife concurs), and has a pleasing design inside and out. Many a BMV/MB/Audi have watched my back end disappear in the distance, and the shocked looks from SUV drivers expecting to blow my slow Volvo wagon off the road remain priceless. Also has a great NAV system and shifter. All of this refers to the MT: beware the AT (GT), it's much slower."
volvo,v70,2005,Buffalo Bob, 06/23/2005,Not a soccer mom,5,After starting out looking at Volvo V70 Cross Country models and deciding they're dogs - real soccer mom cars - I went through a number of SUVs up to and including a 4Dr Ford F150 P/U.  Then gas hit $2.50 and someone reccomended I check out a V70R. I didn't even know they existed.  Once I checked them on line goodbye to V6s & V8s... Fortunately my dealer had a used S60R to test drive so I got a taste - and began the process of getting a V70R. Build quality seems terrific. Performace with the 6 speed is excellent. Gas mileage is 23+ at the speeds the car performs best. 'And talk about stealth.  I even passed a state trooper and he never noticed.  After all it's a Volvo wagon right?  Cool!
volvo,v70,2005,Orion T. Osborne, 06/03/2005,Volvo V70R-2005,4,"I purchased the automatic version of this vehicle because I am a high mileage driver (50,000 miles per year- road miles). This vehicle is a little slugish and I have discussed this with my dealer.  I was expecting a faster automobile off the line and currently I am considering an after market EUC upgrade. I owned a 2001 V70 T-5 that was quicker.  Mechanically, Volvo parts don't last many miles (bushings, shocks, engine mounts, etc). My T-5 had one of everything replaced in 205,000 miles, except the engine and the trans needed replacing when I traded it in.  I truly hope the V-70R holds up better over time."
volvo,v70,2005,ohpoppy, 12/14/2017,"@145,000",4,"so far at 145 I lost the left cv axle ( cracked, likely an anomaly) and the steering universal joint coming off the steering shaft got sticky, I sprayed penetrating oil and greased, its fine now. This car is dependable and good on gas.. over 30mpg on highway. It also tows well.. 2500 lbs 800 miles. I also own a 05 T5 with lower miles. I find the gas mileage on the non turbo 2.4 and the 2.5 T5 are the same.  Power.. who cares!!  I prefer the 2.4 since I need not worry about a complex engine and possible costly problems. the T5 is loaded and leatherly.. love it. the 2.4 is plain Jane but a very useful car and is my daily driver.  after owning a Saab that broke all the time, I'm pleased but the Saab drove like a Ferrari and the Volvo's, well.. kind of poopy but solid.

volvo,v70,2005,direnius, 08/21/2011,"Good looking, comfortable cruiser",4,"Living in Istanbul with narrow street and lots of ups and downs I was a bit worried how this car would handle the city. But it did -even better than my previous V40. It's a joy to drive to work every day, but even more fun to drive around in the country side. It's audio (Dynaudio) is wonderfull, the power (2.0T) is more than enough to get the head start, needed once in a while and the comfort is unbeatable. What it lacks is a USB (or even AUX) connection. Thinking that one third of the price Renault's has both a MP3 playing CD player and a USB connection standart, this is something Volvo should be ashamed of. Still it's a beauty and a more good looking station wagon is hard to come by. "
volvo,v70,2005,Vince, 02/21/2009,Dependable car,4,"We have an '03 V70 and liked it so much that we bought the '05. Car is solid, comfortable, and dependable. Normal services and no real problems yet through 62K miles. Does have electrical snafus -- at times the fuel gauge doesn't register fuel remaining, and when cold, the MPG and fuel remaining readings arbitrarily change between the 4 or so displays available. Wide turning radius on the 17"" wheels -- larger than the '03 with 16"" wheels. Smooth & light steering, but bumpier ride than the '03 due to the 225/45R17 tires I suppose. Engine is responsive and turbo gets car up to freeway speed quickly. Original Pirelli's still on -- probably replace at 70K."
volvo,v70,2005,Tony, 12/15/2004,"Volvo V70 -- the ""alternative"" SUV",5,"This is my second V70.  The first was a 
V70XC (Cross Country).  The V70R, also 
an AWD vehicle, offers the best of all

car with its adjustable, computer-
controlled chassis.  It gets great gas 
mileage -- imagine a 5-cylinder engine 
(cheap to drive) that will crank out 
300 horses when you want to have fun.  
Finally imagine the traction and 
versatility of an SUV in a luxury car 
that is loaded with safety features.  
As long as Volvo remains Volvo and

vehicle than I had expected. Even the base engine 
(auto tranny BTW), handles very well 
for us. Carrying 5 people, it seems to 
move pretty well too. I have not had any problems with 
acceleration. The V70's fit and finish are top

more rear passenger room than we had in 
our 1999 Ford Explorer, with comparable

Upon delivery of the vehicle, within 1/2 mile leaving the dealership, the car made this awful clunking and squeaking noise in the front suspension. I drove back to the dealer and they inspected it. They said that one of the springs in the front suspension came out of its seat. Furthermore, headlights were pointed straight down making them useless for night driving. Went back the next day to get the headlights re-aimed, said it was done. Guess what? Still pointing straight down. Furthermore, the clunking and squeaking in the front suspension came back.

After EXTENSIVE searching , we landed on the Volvo v70 non-turbo, specifically for gas mileage and not having to use 93 octane.  I can get about 400 miles to a tank, so on top of great mileage, I go long time between fill ups.  We bought after having a baby and the stadium seating is great for a car seat to see out the window.  My husband is 6' and has some difficulty getting comfortable in the driver's position (the s40 we had for a loaner was roomier, he said).  I've been very comfortable driving it and it has nice pickup.  I didn't give a 10 for performance because after going from a VWGolf this is not as easy to handle. Good car for antiSUV ppl."

Our kids were initially disappointed to see the van go, but once we started our vacation with the V70 they were very happy. Seats are way more comfortable, and with the integrated child seats they actually have more rear seat room. We like to cost of filling up compared to the minivan, about 30% better fuel economy, and we are comfortable in Volvo's awesome seats, and the dual zone AC keeps up both happy in the front as we can adjust to our preferences. We recently did an 900KM long weekend trip, and every left the car far more refreshed and relaxed in the Volvo versus the minivan."

a standing start but thats easily
forgotten, just as much as it is easy to
forget your doing well over the speed

about, breaking the traditional rules of
 what a wagon should be in both power,

There are so many hidden features that dealer didn't even know. The built in child boosters are amazing. The rain sensing wipers work perfectly. Built into the back seat, cargo nets that hook to the ceiling to keep the dog in the back. Fuel economy isn't the same as my Jetta Wagon even when Volvo says it should be but the car is much bigger so it shouldn't be expected. The bonus of AWD just adds to the car's worth.

When you first start it up, it revs to 2,000 rpm and within a few seconds drops to around 700 +/-.  Dealer said should be that way. Had a 98 V70 XC before and only had minor stuff.  I traded down this time to V70 becasue of price and looks. Bought it for safety, best seats in the market place, heated seats,dual air controls, and highly rated reliabiltiy in consumer reports. Holds the road nicely. BTW, my wife has hit in the back by a big pick up. Smased truck front and radiator, it had to be towed.  No injury to my wife, drove it home. No glass breakage, bumpers & shock system did job."
volvo,v70,2005,Jude, 06/30/2008,V70 2.5T Wagon,4,"This is our second V70, we had the first for 4 years. Purchased the first wagon used, had minor issue with brakes, oxygen senor however nothing major. Our second V70, 2005 wagon purchased it used, great car, looks and drives great."
volvo,v70,2005,Kyang, 12/15/2005,My First Volvo Wagon,4,"My Volvo V70 2.5T was delivered with two weatherstrips deformed and a noisy V- belt. They all gor fixed under warranty. The engine vibration is felt at idle and under accelaration. I think it is common for 5 cylinder engine (the Audi 5000 has the similar vibration). Once the engine is at cruising speed (~2000 rpm), it is quiet. The dealer service is excellence. It probably will be expensive after the warranty expires. The only anoying thing is the idle time before shut down the engine after a long drive (to prolong the turbo charger's life)."

is a little short but it is pretty 
accomodating"
volvo,v70,2005,JHWinick, 12/16/2004,AWESOME!!,4,"A perfect ""no compromise"" compromise.  
For those that need the features of a 
station wagon, but really desire the 
sportiness of a two-seater - this is 
the ticket.  High performance, high 
comfort and high utility.  An awesome 
automobile."
volvo,v70,2005,DWallace, 03/21/2005,Volvo V70 T5,4,"Excellent all rounder. I do a lot of freeway miles and this car makes the trips pleasureable. It has a lot of power which is useful when joining the freeway or overtaking. It has a very comfortable driving position and feels rock solid on the road. And believe it or not, it's fun to drive. On an open road the performance of this car is quite surprising."
volvo,v70,2005,Sleeper, 04/01/2005,Fourth Turbo Volvo,4,"The V70R is the perfect AWD replacement for anyone who has enjoyed an 850 turbo. The accelleration (with automatic trans) is very similar but the ride is more compliant and the handling much improved (you would never know you are in a wagon when cornering). If you wish more accelleration, go with the 6-speed manual - you will find the accelleration of the automatic underwhelming (considering the car has 300HP)compared with the 6M. The '04 is my wife's car and I will be replacing my Volvo Cross Country with a V70R 6M this spring."
volvo,v70,2006,V70 R AWD, 08/09/2007,My Sports Car Replacement,4,"We are pleasantly surprised.  We had to find a family vehicle to replace the not so family friendly 03 Porsche 911.  My new replacement vehicle is a wolf is sheeps clothing: fun, fast with room for our new addition (our daughter) and the family dog.  I was not expecting the performance that is provided in this car from a Volvo, not to mention a wagon.  As it stands now, I dont even miss my beloved Porsche. Interior is well laid out and all functions are easy to operate.  As for fuel mileage, average 26.1 mpg; this is higher than the 25 mpg advertised in every review Ive read thus far.  Love it!"
volvo,v70,2006,Erin Ingram, 12/05/2015,Great Car! No issues after 10 years of ownership.,5,"I realized the other day that my car was 10 years old, and I decided that I should let people know what a wonderful vehicle it's been. I've had nothing done to her except regular maintenance and tire replacement.

volvo,v70,2006,drcjj, 12/03/2006,The Real Deal Rocket,4,"Wow, I've had this car for 5 mos. and over 8K miles and it's only been in the shop for the 7.5k service, tire balance and a headlight aiming (set way too low for mountain driving).  My previous car was a Porsche Cayenne S, always in the shop for visits, now I'm free to just drive, YAAY! My friends were curious why, well it's way faster, better gas mileage, equal brakes (Brembo) and the controls for HVAC and audio actually make sense at a glance. As for driving, I've enjoyed the glaring looks from hot rod sounding mustangs etc. I stay with them as they grind and wail along attempting to show off a bit.  My V70R just makes this humming sound, not very impressive I guess. I Love it!"
volvo,v70,2006,Feh, 05/05/2008,One of the best turbo wagons out there,4,"Very nicely styled, stands out from the average V70. Nice Pegasus 17"" rims. Very good inline-5 turbo, twin-intercooled engine. Smooth 6-speed auto transmission. Adjustable continuously control chassis concept suspension is great: click, and you are in comfort mode, another click, and suspension fully tightens. Amazing! Excellent 4-piston Brembo brakes all around. Thick rimmed, sporty steering wheel. Leather-wrapper everywhere. One of the most comfortable seats I've had in a car. HU-850 unit is awesome, Nav unit is OK."
volvo,v70,2006,Christopher, 08/05/2009,An excellent family car,4,This is the first Volvo I have owned and I have never regretted buying it. The safety features offer peace of mind. The car's performance is very good and reliability is way above average. I have literally had nothing to do but scheduled maintenance + change 2 tires in 3 years. Legroom in the rear seat is cramped a bit for larger adults but teens and kids fit great. The integrated safety seats saved us about $400 because we didn't have to buy new baby seats once our boys hit 3 yrs old. I am contemplating a new XC70 now.
volvo,v70,2006,David, 08/14/2007,Worth the Money for the Seats,4,"My wife had decided she wanted more than a Japanese car, one that will go over 200K (like all our other cars).  We looked at Outback, Camry, Accord, and Passat.  Camry and Accord no longer come in wagons, and we didn't like the Subaru.  Saab, BMW and Audi were overpriced.  We were so impressed with the seats and the Volvo reputation for safety we bought it. Absolutely no problems, 25 MPG city, 31 MPG highway.  Not too shabby for a turbo.  The 5 cylinder is a little rough compared to a V6, but the car has a smooth ride."
volvo,v70,2006,Peter, 04/17/2006,A blast to drive!!!!,4,"This car has put the ""fun"" back into driving....and at a reasonable price. I shopped around a ton before buying my 2006 V70R. Nothing else came close! If you want lots of room without the SUV size,if you need safety, quality, speed, handling, this car is it. There are a few negatives though. Front bumper clearance is a concern everytime I park. The ride can be a jarring at times...price to pay for a ""sporty"" suspension, even in comfort mode. but the thing that bugs me the most is the turning radius. It's huge. I knew all of this going into this relationship. Bottom line. I love this car. Leaving an Acura TL/BMW 3 series at a light wondering what just happened is priceless!!!! "
volvo,v70,2006,Phil Corray, 10/11/2005,One of the best!,4,"Easily one of the best cars I have ever driven! I am an enthusiast who has owned and driven everything. If you're to buy this car, you're getting $65,000 of quality for 40. If you're the kind of person who likes to have something that is all about quality and also shows complete thoughtfulness without wanting to impress anyone but yourself, this is the car for you. Its a car that can easily be put on a track and later cart your wife, kids and the dog home as well."
volvo,v70,2006,MountainBiker, 03/24/2006,"Practical Fun, with emphasis on the FUN",4,"I have had the V70R for 5 months now and what a blast to drive.  This is a great all around car. Its interior is well done an presents a great image for driving clients around.  Its handling makes you feel like a kid again and the storage space is as good or better than many SUV's.   I moved to this car from a SUV and won't go back! Just as safe and a whole lot more fun going from A to B.  The dealer approach seems to be a theme with Volvo.  This is the second Volvo I leased from Volvo of Lisle and they could not have been easier to deal with, before and after my purchase.  I give the dealer a 10 out of 10, especially when compared with previous dealer experiences."
volvo,v70,2006,LP, 01/12/2007,2006 V70 R,5,This is a great car and is comparable and better than cars costing much more.  Very smooth 6 speed Automatic transmission and lots and lots of power.  This is a high performance car in sheeps clothing.
volvo,v70,2006,Michael, 10/22/2005,v70 the family freindly s60 from volvo,4,"I like the v70 it's a great family car, my younger  chidren have a great view when out ""low"" window sills. In base form it is a cruising vehicle but peppy enough. Its has over-competent handling for a family car compared to an suv or minivan - it will carve an off ramp suprisingly well- but hardly any one who drives one knows that.  The v70 is subtle in its refinement which really shines in the mundane like running errands around town. It will keep up with and pass suvs with 3x's the horse power if you feel so inclined but prefers to quietly glide about - It is not u Dad's pontiac grand safari - it is a mercedes within 9/10ths of that vehicle at a 20K discount."

volvo,v70,2006,rickc, 05/04/2006,Still the best wagon,4,"In 30 years this is my fourth Volvo and my first brand new one.. I always go out intending to buy a Toyota or a Subaru but always come home with a Volvo. Volvo may not often be the most reliable,the most economical and maybe not even the safest car in tests, but the comfort and ergonomics of the cabin is still unsurpassed. The 2006 in comparison to previous years (I also own a 1999) has a much smoother drive train and is certainly quieter under acceleration."
volvo,v70,2006,DO, 01/22/2007,"Safety, Features, Comfort & Performance",4,"After 12 months, still impressed.  Purchased after extensive research and test drives of several brands in a quest for a wagon-- closest competitors were Mazda6, Audi and BMW 3 series wagons.  (BMW 3 series wagons impossible to find, plus dealers not helpful.) Gas mileage has actually improved over time to about 22 mpg around town-- dealer recommended using Chevron regular grade and it has performed well.  Brake check valve and outside mirror glass replaced under warranty right after delivery.  Otherwise trouble-free.  Dealer/service has been great."
volvo,v70,2006,happyR, 01/21/2007,What else is there?,4,"Can't  be beat; it took a long time to find the manual transmission I wanted, but it was worth the wait. . I've got a big dog and love to have a little fun  while driving her around: the Volvo simply wins by default!"
volvo,v70,2006,Jennifer Vee, 01/17/2017,2006 Volvo V70,5,"This was my second Volvo. Ten years old and has been a fantastic car. Reliable. Great on gas. Comfortable to drive. The only downside is that the backseat got to be too small for road trips with all 4 of us in the car (8-10 hour trips a couple times a year) as the kids grew to 5'10 and 5'11.   When they were younger (and shorter) it was fantastic. Overall it's been a great car!

volvo,v70,2006,SJF, 08/11/2008,Better than Ever,5,"This is my 4th Volvo and one of my favorites - why? Supportive comfort in front seats, handling control around corners is very good, driveability and great gas mileage. City average 28 and Highway 32. Sound system is very good, really like the system health displays. Husband is very tall and enjoys the ride; great cargo space. Back seats are just okay for adults, better for kids. Only issue in 2.5 years and 33K miles is a small rattle  in the driver dash sometimes. Love this car."
volvo,v70,2006,JR, 10/04/2006,2.4L 4-dr Wagon Automatic,4,"You can feel quality in the ride and for a station wagon, it handles surprisely well. The instrumentation panel is easy to read and manipulate (within easy reach.)The gauges are visually appealing. My previous car had Bose stereo, the Volvo, although not Bose, it can be argued sounds somewhat comparable.  Pick-up and go won't leave you quivering when passing another vehicle. With recent money incentives, you can hardly beat the price compared to comparable vehicles. If you must drive a station wagon, the Volvo is the way to go. "
volvo,v70,2006,Don, 11/14/2017,Better Car,4,"This has been one of my most dependable, trouble free, good-looking cars I have ever owned. I did not drive new Volvo when selecting a new car recently as I was not impressed with the most recent changes.

This car is now owned by my son living in Tennessee. Still a good, dependable vehicle.

The car has been in the shop since ownership for a totaling of almost two months. The customer service at the headquarter is terrible and unsupportive. They do not follow- up on complaints. The most I have received from them is a pen and a survey on their services.  I have a love-hate relationship with this car. Only if they have meticulously put the pieces together, this would be one of the best cars I have driven. Would I own another Volvo? NO on the company, NO on the dealer, NO on the car, YES on the seats.  "
volvo,v70,2006,Steve, 01/25/2010,Great Car,4,"I've had many Volvos and this is by far my favorite.  It has all that you would expect from a Volvo wagon, plus it's fun to drive."
volvo,v70,2006,William, 07/21/2010,Just couldn't cut it,2,"Purchased pre-owned to replace XC90 which died.  Low mileage example, super clean.  Had to have the extra room afforded, but just couldn't handle the minor issues over the two months of ownership.  Drove 6000 miles in those two months with dash and dash VIN rattle.  Incredibly rough ride for a ""luxury"" wagon.  Traded to a 4Runner and it has a smoother ride.  After only two months simply had to give up and eat the depreciation.  I avg 35,000 miles/yr."
volvo,v70,2006,William Likens, 09/19/2005,Poor front bumper ground clearance,4,"Beautiful car, but has problem with poor ground clearance.  Bumper cover scrapes curb stones and gets damaged when pulling out of parking spaces.  Don't buy the R model unless you are willing to pay for multiple $950 bumper cover replacements.  It happened to me.  Apparently the experience is very common.  The V70 has better front clearance."
volvo,v70,2006,06V70R, 08/08/2007,Unassuming yet Striking,4,My V70R has been an absolute pleasure to own.  This is a drivers car!  My last two cars were the XCV70 and V70T5.  The R puts these two cars to shame.  With a one hour commute each way I am enjoying the car more each day.  From seat support and comfort to sheer power the V70R for the money is the best performance and value on the market today.

I started with a 122S and have owned P1800's, 200 series, 7 series and 94, 97, 00, 03 and 06 wagons. My wife is currently driving a kool 05 V50 that we both enjoy driving. My current 06 is a T5 model with high pressure turbo. I ordered pretty much anything I could on this one and it is as close to perfect as any car I have driven. People are always on deck to pick up my 3 yr. old model at replacement time. My 06 has been blessed with 2 1/2 lowering springs and 19"" wheels. The glass is deeply shaded and when I park it anywhere or drive through town it turns heads. The last 4 wagons have seldom required ANY warranty work."
volvo,v70,2006,AndyH, 10/24/2006,Gas Hog! Like an SUV,3,"This is a solid, quality and well appointed car. Feels like it is worth the money and is comfortable to drive. Great capacity and a steady family hauler. However, the real world fuel economy is far worse than claimed by Volvo. If you care about emissions and fuel economy you should not buy this car. I am not sure how Volvo manages to fool EPA ratings but the real world fuel consumption is more like an SUV than a sedan or wagon. I would not buy again due to this."
volvo,v70,2006,Robert, 10/31/2006,Great choice for my wife.,4,My wife wanted to consider a Volvo V70 wagon as her next choice in an updated auto.  She also wanted to get-out of her SUV as well as improved fuel economy.  She likes the style and comfort of the interior a lot as well as the established safety record.  We both have been very happy with this new car.  
volvo,v70,2006,CentIndy, 08/15/2005,Fun for Mom,4,Fun to drive for those who don't want the boring ride of a mini-van.  Has plenty of space for everything you need.  Can drive on long trips and not get so fatigued.

Much to everyone's surprise I purchased a used Volvo V70 2.5T; everyone thought I'd buy an Outback.  So far, I'm very happy with the car: comfortable, quick, good handling, hauls lots of stuff, great AC and heated seats.  I wish the gas mileage were a bit higher, but waiting to take a longer trip to see what happens.  The car also has a very large turning radius but it's due to the 17"" tires.  I think I got a good deal by going out of State (to Texas) - I saved about $10K off MSRP by buying one with 6K miles, plus it had the extended 6yr/100K warranty. I'm hoping for many years of driving satifaction!"

volvo,v70,2006,Iowaman, 01/11/2007,"Great car, great buy!",4,"Bought this ""last year"" model at considerable savings, really not much more than ""non premium"" cars we considered.  I now understand why people buy luxury automobiles.  This car is incredibly smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  The leather seating is superb and the vehicle feels very solid in its construction.  Cars and trucks passing by produce hardly any noise in the cabin, unlike the SUV we traded in, where we had to shout to be heard. The Volvo safety features also make it a great purchase."
volvo,v70,2006,capemaymatt, 05/18/2007,Great family cruiser,4,"We bought our red stick shift V70 last summer, and are very pleased with it. If you want a 7 passenger vehicle (we got the rear rumble seat) without having to drive a huge SUV or minivan, this is it.  It's not tremendously sporty, but has adequate pickup and corners well. It's also very comfortable for long drives.  Service and parts are very expensive."
volvo,v70,2007,White, 08/25/2006,V70 first 6 months,4,"What a nice car! Bought it for safety reputation.  Handles well, is comfortable and holds road like it's glued.  Too much wind noise and low beams cut off too short.  Fit and finish is first rate and car is tight, excpept for wind noise. Gets less fuel economy than other mid-sized domestic cars, which was a surprise.  Get 21-23 in town and 26-29 in hilly country, so I guess that's not too bad.  Guess I'm getting old, but it has one tough oil filter for a shade tree mechanic!  Plenty speedy with 2.5 turbo.  The run flat tires had defective sensors that dealer service did not understand and were impossible to fix.  Eventually replaced.  I like the car alot! "
volvo,v70,2007,alphamobile, 02/14/2012,We are now Volvo fans,5,"Ours is a '07 model and we bought it in '10 with 32K miles.
In two years I have put close to 30K miles on it.
It being our first Volvo, and first Euro car for that matter of fact, it's been a very pleasant car.
At first we were feeling iffy about due to our fear about the notorious high cost of maintenance of Euro cars.
Fortunately, in two years the only repair expense (not including regular maint.) was $150 to replace the brake vacuum pump.
It certainly helps that our local Volvo dealer repair shop has very competitive pricing.
The car is quite powerful and handles quite well.
Some critics say it's not very sporty when compared to BMW.
But not everybody needs or really wants a BMW."

volvo,v70,2007,Dave - LA, 03/03/2008,Just Bought One!,4,"I have been wanting to purchase a V70 or XC70 for a few years. I swapped my Toyota 4Runner due to gas mileage for the V70.  The Volvo drives and sounds a lot like my Honda Accord that I had 12 years ago! I love that Honda and I love the way this car drives. I will be using the car for surfing, so I opted for the optional roof racks which do produce some wind noise. The biggest suprise is the performance. I have owned 3 porsches and I currently own a 911. I must say the Volvo's pick up is excellent, and I can really feel the turbo's kick. I am very pleased with the car so far, and I hope to keep it for at least 8-10 years!   "
volvo,v70,2007,Dave, 11/26/2015,This is one classy car!,5,"I just love this car.  It's my first Volvo, purchased pre-owned with 110K miles. Now has 145K. Solid heavy car.  Hugs the road like a leech.  Peppy 2.5L turbo.  More than enough acceleration for me even with a full load.  Gas mileage is adequate around town (approx 21), very good highway mileage.  Interior fittings are high quality.  The leather is thick and supple.  So far she has been very reliable.  The front passenger window came off it's track, and the dealer had to replace part of the mechanism inside the door.  It was partially covered by an extended warranty.  The only other issue I have had is with the radio (HU650 standard factory radio) where the AM band stopped working. Bought a used unit off ebay and it works great.

I would definitely buy another one.  In fact after having now owned this car for almost 2 years, my wife wants an XC90 for herself.

Like other posters mentioned, the turning circle is not good.  U Turns can be tricky. And Volvo is not made for DIY. Even changing certain bulbs are unnecessarily difficult

June 2020: She now has 180K miles.  She is as solid as ever. During the past year, had the front-end serviced (ball joints, sway bars etc) also had the PCV system serviced -- that was a pretty time-consuming job.  Services are done by a small independent shop that only services Volvos.  The AC needs recharging.  But the smoothness of the engine and it's effortless acceleration  belies the fact that this car is 13 years old and is pushing 200K miles!

I got safety.I drive in ice and snow worry free laughing at all the other drivers who stay home in the winter. I wanted dependability. This car has 92,000 miles on it, and other than tires and oil changes, it has never, ever broken down. I bow down to Volvo as a nervous mom of 2 driving teenage daughters who have used it as their first car; as a family on vacation who can stuff more stuff in its cargo area than a truck;as owners of two Welsh corgis and two Newfoundlands who could not damage the leather interior no matter what they dragged aboard.It was expensive;now I know why: it will last forever and stay beautiful!It looks as good/performs as well as it did day one."

I am returning to Volvo after Mercedes and Acura and purchased this car because of the seat comfort, overall safety and solid highway ride.
I spend 22,00 miles a year on the highway so comfort is a priority.
The seat is sublime, by far the best of any car I have owned, including past Volvo's. Speed sensitive steering makes it easy around town, heavy on the highway.
Love the classic styling.
No anxiety on I-95 in the rain, between trucks. The 2.4L base engine is underpowered, no C240 or TSX for sure.
With premium fuel acceleration is acceptable. Frankly, I can see having this car for 300,000 miles."
volvo,v70,2007,MHR26, 11/04/2006,Love the XC VOLVO,4,"I bought a similar version in 2001 and drove my Volvo for over 185,000 with no issues other than routine maintenance.  The engineering is fantastic, fuel economy is good considering size and weight of the vehicle.  Safety is fantastic and overall, best car I have ever bought."
volvo,v70,2007,Carl Moore Houston, 07/16/2010,Carl Moore Houston #2 Review,3,"My first review was Oct 2007. Since then the V70 has 19,000 miles on it - low mileage. The door locks have gone crazy opening and closing at random and that was fixed. The main problem I have had is with rust buildup on the brake rotors and pads which cause wheel shimmy when braking. At first Volvo refused to cover under warranty citing normal wear and tear. Cost- almost $1000. After complaining to main office NJ, they agreed to cover the rotors but not the pads (all 4 wheels). Ridiculous. That's still $450. I have never had this problem in 47 years. I would never recommend to anyone to buy a new Volvo - they used to be really great cars when they were 4 cylinder cars. I still have 2 940s. "
volvo,v70,2007,Affecionato, 11/22/2010,V70R Revelation,4,"I've had numerous Volvo wagons, including a 740, 850 and V70T5. I've also owned from Acuras to VW's but nothing comes close to the R. Turbocharged engines have been used by the Swedes for decades, and are now more and more in vogue with certain German makers. They offer the low-end torque appreciated in our driving environment.  The R has the ability to go from a high speed cruiser to a fun car that can be easily tossed around. It is the ultimate sleeper wagon with all the traditional Volvo attributes. The leather is beautiful and the interior is understated and built to last for decades. "
volvo,v70,2007,RRB, 02/06/2007,2.5T,3,"Provides more usable space than most small SUVs while possessing better road manners and comfort.  However, after having driven Saabs for many years, I found the large turning radius of this vehicle to be almost truck-like by comparison.   "
volvo,v70,2007,Baird Morgan, 03/20/2019,comfortable and safe,5,"This has been a very reliable car. Average mpg is 30 in the winter and 32 in the summer. No major repairs--just the usual, brakes, tuneup, oil changes. It is a comfortable car, fun to drive and very reliable.

volvo,v70,2007,Rick Dalton, 08/29/2017,Beware the Money Pit,1,"Car looks beautiful, but has been an absolute money pit!  Bought this car new put about 85K miles on it over the last 10 years.  All just driving around town and an occasional road trip (normal soccer mom stuff).  The scheduled maintenance was performed and documented as regular as rain.  However, the, the maintenance cost will could drive one to drinking...we are just under $10K in maintenance and repairs in the last 12 months (mostly transmission and struts...yes, struts).  This was our 3rd Volvo, but will be our last.   Other observations: the turning radius for the car is poor and the turbo causes a very annoying delay when accelerating.  My advice -- BUY SOMETHING ELSE.
"
volvo,v70,2007,Otoman, 06/14/2008,Stealth,4,"This has been a fantastic car. Very comfortable for the long haul with outstanding seats, lots of cargo room and best of all, it flies! No one expects that a Volvo wagon can move so quickly. I often have cars trying to pass me on the right/cut me off, etc.  I can easily close down any hole in the traffic with this car.  Passing/merging is fun. Blitzing down interstate on-ramps is a joy. Clover leaf on-ramps are a treat as well. The upgraded sound system is worth the money. If you want a lot of go with very little show, this is your car. "
volvo,v70,2007,mercuryct, 01/20/2009,Comfortable with quirks,3,"Supremely comfortable as far as its seats go, 2.4 provides adequate power, feels very safe, understated looks. Its quirks can be very annoying, however. Chief among them are counterintuitive and slow-acting power door locks, needlessly complicated radio and climate controls, inadequate sun visors, unlit power-seat memory buttons. Not especially quiet in terms of engine noise. Fit and finish adequate but perhaps less than I expected. The dash trim is apparently real wood but finished to look cheaper than the plastic on my old Subaru. And might I add that tire-pressure sensors are a nightmare."
volvo,v70,2007,Michael, 05/03/2007,Well designed family wagon,5,V2.4L provides enough power for daily use.  Ride is quiet and steering provides excellent handling. Excellent suspension.  Good combination of engine and automatic transmission.  Integrated child booster seat may not be comfortable for long distances since legs touch the edge of the seat.  Leather interior will require a protective sheet for the baby seat.
volvo,v70,2007,volvo bill, 09/05/2007,Outstanding Value!,4,"Great design for short people; offers plenty of visibility. Bought a luxury package that makes the car very attractive.  Wish gas mileage were better, though, but at least it accepts regular gas without harming anything."
volvo,v70,2007,Carl Moore Houston, 11/04/2007,Carl's Review,4,I bought a 2007 V70 closeout which came with lots of options as a replacement for my wife's 940 which was totaled in a wreck -- great deal . The car is very comfortable driving and handling. The 2.5T has excellent pickup compared with the older B230F engine. Gas mileage is good -- approx 22 mpg around town. 
volvo,v70,2007,Moi, 05/03/2008,All Purpose Fun Vehicle,5,Great on the open road and mileage has been great city 25 highway 31 MPG. Handles better than my prior bmw even though it is a station wagon. Great for long trips and needing extra space. Too bad the 2008's are being redesigned and don't hold up against the 2007 V70
volvo,v70,2007,Alex, 12/23/2019,Stylish and practical,5,"I am on my second V70- first one was 2001 2.4 turbo and I only sold it at 192k miles because I found my 2007 2.5T with low miles and good price, these cars are good on the road, quiet at highway speeds and comfortable. They are a lot easier to maintain than BMW and the build quality is as good as other German cars, as they share a lot of Bosch components. Late model years (2006- 2007) are preferred as they are flawless, built in Gent, Belgium, my 2001 was built in Sweden and I would say rust proofing was better. This model comes with optional 3rd row seat(rear facing) which makes it great when you have guest to move them around with the kids
"
volvo,v70,2008,Dan De Angelis, 08/31/2015,Wagon Love,5,"I held off on my review until we had several thousand miles logged in the car and a few service intervals. This isn’t our first Volvo as we have had 240’s, 740’s and S70’s through the years. Along with Volvos we have owned everything from Mini Vans to Mercedes, approximately 55 vehicles in all.
I was attracted to the V70 because of styling, performance and the need for cargo space. All of which have been fulfilled with this car. We found this previously owned with 48,000 gentle one owner mi. and all service records up to date. We have taken several road trips thus far and use as a commuter during the week. 
Absolutely no disappointments at all and I enjoy driving a vehicle that doesn’t  look like the majority of vehicles on the road. Other reviewers have a tendency to compare this to vehicles that out perform and out handle the V70 but they miss the essence entirely. This wagon has plenty of power provided by the 3.2 Litre ( same motor in the LR1 Land Rover) and delivers well when called upon. The comfort is second to none and the fit and finish throughout the vehicle is way above the standard run of the mill cars for the masses.
Our V70 is the silver metallic sans the luggage rack with 6 spoke 16” wheels. It’s amazing how many people compliment on the looks and the younger gen love it! Kinda cool for a station wagon huh ?
I will be adding Bilstein HD Struts and Shocks along with rear stabilizer bar soon for ride and sound improvements but that’s it. We continue to service at all intervals and to this point have absolutely no complaints. Go find a well kept V70 and stand out!

20K addl. mile update:
Still the one! Replaced motor mounts because of quick deterioration due to driving on brick residential roads and thats been it. The bricks got to the brick!
Still quiet, comfortable and turning heads! Interesting to see a Bentley wagon now. Could this be the new statement vehicle?
"
volvo,v70,2008,steveheckman, 01/23/2011,Excellant alternative to boorish SUV,5,"What the reviewers at Edmunds [and elsewhere] don't seem to grasp, is that many of us don't like the ""me too"" look and feel of an elevated SUV.

Volvo and other EU manufactures offer a sporty driving experience in a very practical design - a station wagon. Not trendy...which is a characteristic that I appreciate. 

In an era dominated by overweight SUVs and their ""cross-over"" cousins, the Volvo V70 is a sign of sanity and good taste. 

If you need an elevated drivers seat to feel important, the V70 is not for you. If you drive with one eye on your cell phone and your brain firmly rooted in cyber-space, please stay in your SUV, and I'll keep an eye out for you."
volvo,v70,2008,John, 02/13/2009,A great alternative to an SUV,4,"I've put 6,500 miles on this car over the past 6 months and have been very pleased. It replaced a Lexus LS430 and an older Volvo V70. The ride quality is smooth and quiet. While I really enjoyed the super-quiet ride and precise handling of the Lexus, I am also enjoying the sportier driving experience of this Volvo. I much prefer this car to the roughness and sway of the SUV's I have owned. Based on the car's computer readout, fuel mileage is considerably better than the EPA numbers (30 - 32 MPG at 60 MPH). Build quality seems good with no significant problems so far.  "
volvo,v70,2008,judith, 05/10/2009,"subtle, sophisticated, and fun",5,"Swapped for an E320 -- 1"" shorter and cavernous in the back, which I don't notice while I am having so much fun in these wonderful front seats, wheeling a surprisingly sporty but beautiful driver cabin.  Drives like a high-end sport sedan."
volvo,v70,2008,Steve in Minnesota, 02/10/2010,A good old traditional station wagon,4,"Interior comfort is the best feature of the V70.  There is plenty of space for both passengers and cargo in a relatively compact package.  The power train is generally refined.  The transmission is very smooth but the engine growls a tad too loud for an almost 40,000 car.  There is way too much shudder and noise when going over bumps but otherwise it feels solid. The highway ride is quiet and serene.  We purchased for 25 grand as a rental return. I believe the MSRP was about 38 grand, which is a little spendy.  We're getting 22-34 mpg in mixed driving.  The heated seats are the best I have ever felt.  Very welcome in Minnesota. "
volvo,v70,2008,Wally, 10/30/2008,Great Automobile,5,A lot of fun to drive. Great handling. Excellent braking. Beautiful interior - very comfortable. This is my 7th Volvo and I'm not disappointed. Very classy exterior styling. With freeway driving I'm getting between 27 and 30.5 mpg.
volvo,v70,2008,Phil, 03/08/2008,Nicely Appointed,4,"I've had the car for two weeks, I am very satisfied with the vehicle, it's got lots of pep, is very stable in snow and ice, is rock solid on dry pavement, very tight steering, very little torque steer, great in tight turns at speed, a quiet and enjoyable ride.  I'm getting 21.5 in mixed driving, I burn mid grade fuel.      "
volvo,v70,2008,TrackAHolic, 03/20/2008,Great so far,4,"Bought to replace Dodge Dakota Quad Cab after having baby.  Compared mostly against Dodge Magnum and BMW Sportswagon. Volvo had nicest interior and was reasonably roomy. Dodge had most room and great performance, but wife didn't like the styling. BMW had best cornering and steering feel, but was a little small. Car will be used for long cruises and day-to-day driving, so it was a perfect fit. Driving dynamics are sloppy, but it still has good overall grip and acceleration. The interior is beautiful, and really helped sell us on the car. It is a pleasure on any kind of drive, has a great stereo, is quiet, and roomy.  I really like to drive it, and I typically drive a 350Z."
volvo,v70,2008,Bill, 03/28/2008,Very pleased,4,"I have owned the car for three (3) months now and have been very pleased. I was looking for a vehicle that would be capable of towing a small pop-up camper, yet not be as bulky as an SUV - a station wagon was a good solution, and the car is very comfortable. As I was previously a Honda owner, fuel economy has been disappointing, but not unexpected. I average 22 to 23 mpg with my city driving and a tad over 25 mpg on the highway - not too bad all things considered, but I do use high octane fuel."
volvo,v70,2008,Mike, 04/30/2008,Well pleased,4,"This car is what you would expect from Volvo. Understated performance, design with good handling.  This is my second Volvo wagon, previous 240. I love the wagon for the car ride with the hauling of a suv.  Pleased with fuel economy. I commute 70 miles round trip daily on interstates and average 26 mpg."
volvo,v70,2008,aef83a, 06/28/2009,Car is great but possible improvements,4,"This is not a typical station wagon.  The handling is not like that of a sports sedan but it works for what this vehicle is.  You will appreciate the comfort and convenience that the V70 provides, and although I have yet to see proof I hope that it is safe as well."
volvo,v70,2008,Randall S Over, P.E.,V70 Just Arriving from Europe,4,"Picked up the car in Gothenburg, Sweden and drove 1800 miles through Europe. Very easy to handle, beautiful interior, typical great seats and well laid out dash, switches, gauges, etc. Evolutionary update to the design of my S60. If anyone is thinking of the European delivery program, do it, well worth it even with the current value of the US dollar vs the Euro and SEK."
volvo,v70,2008,Peter, 02/04/2009,A classic wagon (with great seats),4,"This isn't necessarily a ""fun"" car, but it is comfortable, quiet and practical.  I think it makes a lot of sense for a family that needs something big enough for kids and gear, but isn't interested in a minivan or SUV.  The interior is beautifully designed and assembled.  It is one of those cars where almost every design decision appears to have been driven by a lot of thought about ergonomics.  Materials are generally high quality.  While the base price might be 32K, it is difficult to find one without a lot of options (and a much higher MSRP). However, I was able to get a ""left- over"" 2008 at a bit over 25 percent off.  I have had this car for only two weeks, so ignore my reliability score."
volvo,v70,2008,Lori, 01/20/2008,Safety First,4,"I've only had the car for a month, so it's difficult to rate reliability.  I purchased the vehicle primarily based on safety and I did a lot of research on safety in determining what to buy.  When it comes to safety, the V70 is a vehicle in which I feel comfortable transporting my golden retriever and passengers, particularly back seat passengers.  The vehicle feels as solid as an SUV without the gas mileage and top heaviness. It's a car I hope to have for years to come."

My previous wagon,  an 2006 v70 saved my wife's life when a foolish man ran a red light and broadsided and destroyed the old  Volvo, my wife emerged bloody but ok, she would be dead in a lesser wagon. I immediately bought a new v70 which is bigger and stronger and safer. No more comment needed.   Rc mckaughlin"

I wanted a new car for our retirement years and the choices are very few for a wagon low enough to easily load canoes and kayaks on the roof, and hold a recumbent trike in the cargo area. The R-Design is a great package so we only added the convenience package (heated seats) and the keyless ignition.  I was pleased to be able to get a nice handling package with the standard drivetrain. "
volvo,v70,2010,Greg Rasa, 01/04/2010,Happy with my purchase so far,4,"Had it 1K miles so far. Solid build. Nice ride. Great seats. Nice stereo. Quiet. Reasonably-priced luxury. Beats my old SUV in every way. Getting 21 mpg city so far. As for models I didn't buy: Audi A4 Avant was gorgeous but had terrible rear-seat legroom and bit of road noise. Passat wagon had lots of road noise. V70 won out on those counts and others. Also, it has 5yrs/60K full maintenance. My only beef: It was scarce in my area, so I didn't have many color choices. Scarce because Volvo would rather sell you an XC70 or 60 (for way more money); also most V70s are a factory buy, apparently. But V70's mileage is better than the XCs. V70 is sleek, solid, luxurious ... the quintessential Volvo."
volvo,v70,2010,Max, 03/08/2010,Back to Volvo,5,"It has been a few years since I owned a Volvo , but this 2010 V70 is a marvelous vehicle. Downsized a little from a Honda Pilot (great vehicle too). The size is perfect for our needs, and the gas mileage is good too for a car of this size and weight(>30mpg on the interstate). Very comfortable and quiet with a solid build quality. Had to order the car from the factory and while it took 3 months to arrive, it was worth the wait."
volvo,v70,2010,SUVFREE, 12/07/2009,Finally could get rid of the SUV,5,"I am finally able to get back to a wagon after 5 years of SUV (2 XC 90s). What a great car the V70. Extremely comfortable; smooth and responsive engine; brisk and ""sporty"" handling. Rock solid/ safe feel. Way better gas mileage that the XC90s I test drove the XC 70, but did not like the external sheaths of plastic on the car, nor the raised ground clearance and the rougher ride. I do wish they made the v70 in AWD, but front wheel will be fine in snow with winter tires. The interior of the car is beautiful. better than BMW and rivaling Audi. Rear seat room is tremendous as is the trunk. Base sound system is more than acceptable. Best family hauler I can think of."
volvo,v70,2010,SUV FREE, 11/30/2009,I Love this Car,4,"This is my 4th Volvo since 1998. (1998 V70, then 2 XC90s, now back to the v70.) This is my wife's car. I also own an Audi S4 and a BMW 1 Series I. I consider myself an ""enthusiast driver"". No, this V70 is not trying to compete with BMW and Audi wagons in terms of handling, but for the vast majority of drivers it will provide a superior level of comfort with more than acceptable handling. I test drove a BMW 5 series, and I much prefer the Volvo for my family car. The interior is fantastic, the seats ultra comfortable, and the ride is more smooth. The interior quality is way beyond VW.  Compared to the XC90 (my last one a V8 Sport) this is WAY more fun to drive!"
volvo,v70,2010,ironman, 11/06/2009,SUV Convert,4,"I did not think I would ever own a wagon of any kind, however, after driving SUV's for years .... I realized that a wagon is just a lower, more affordable, more comfortable version.  I have been extremely satisfied with this vehicle since day one.  The difference in comfort(traded in a 2003 Lexus RX 300) is unbelievable.  I decided to look beyond the ubiquitous Japanese vehicles and found an outstanding vehicle in this Volvo.....The root meaning for the word Volvo ""rolling strength"" certainly applies."
volvo,xc,2002,1randall, 08/17/2013,Great!! Don't take to Auto shops!!,4,This is a really great car. It is very comfortable on long drives and has great performance. I have upgraded some things with parts from IPDUSA and has made it even better. If you research the work yourself and do the required maintenance you will have little issues. You can get better parts at a cheaper price if you look for them and don't go to the dealership. If you are lazy then no matter what car you own it will start to fail!!

A year after getting it the trans started acting up, I was advised to keep driving it till it failed then replace as opposed to repairing it, since the problem would come back. It has some good days and some bad. The instrument panel does not work right, trip odometer randomly changes as well as the clock. The auto-diming mirror is now always dim. The alarm system is defunct because the sensor in the mirror is out, which also prevents me from using the keyless entry. There is an occasional werning noise that sounds like trans but comes and goes, randomly. Because that its a nice car, smooth ride with not bucking. Nice look to, parked"
volvo,xc,2002,Levi, 10/21/2010,"Great car, but expensive to own",4,"I bought a used 2002 Volvo Cross Country in November of 2005. I kept it for 2 1/2 years and put nearly 60K miles on it. I really enjoyed the vehicle. It was excellent in the snow and rain...in fact living in Vermont I have never driven a better car in bad weather. With a set of good snow tires it could literally go anywhere. It was very comfortable on long trips and I loved the fact that it had a huge trunk that could easily hold a weeks worth of luggage as well as the dog. The car was great until it hit 100K and things started needing to be replaced. Most of them were probably considered to be typical for a car with 100K, but the costs were double or even triple that of domestic made."
volvo,xc,2002,lamb, 04/11/2005,comfort at a price,3,"I bought the xc new 3 years ago and have put about 20,000 miles on a year.  I am now in the process of selling this car because I have put 3 sets of tires on this car.  The AWD system eats tires. The standard Pirelli lasted me 24,000 miles.  I then put on swedish made tires and they are no better.  I rotate the tires and alignment is good, but I continue to go through tires.  Now the car is pulling to the right, and 3 different dealerships can't seem to find the problem.  It's very unfortunate to have this problem as this is my 2nd Volvo.  (no problems with my 1990 740 GL)  The XC is very comfortable and nice looking, but the quality is gone.  It is nothing more than an American car now."

Safety, beauty, power and fun to drive; what more do you need? "
volvo,xc,2002,M N Jones, 02/22/2009,Great Car. Expensive to Maintain,4,The XC70 is a strong performer and a very comfortable riding vehicle.  Everyone who sits in the car comments on how comfortable the seats are. I've driven the car in blizzard like conditions and the car handled the roads with ease. The AWD system in the vehicle is second to none.  The only issues I have with the car are the maintenance costs. There are a lot of quirky little things that seem to go wrong with the vehicle or need to be maintained. 
volvo,xc,2002,Gina, 09/21/2009,Future problems....,3,"So here's my experience in a nut shell... On a USED 02 XC70. The car is now 7 years old. 90,000k miles. No accidents. Routinely serviced. I'm the second owner. Was great for the first year, then the problems came one after another. So far, It's violently vibrated and made all sorts of  noises. I've replaced both differentials ($3500 total), and axles ($600)... So far. Now, after much anticipation and dread, I believe my tranny is finally giving out too! It's clunking when downshifting, and surging at low speeds. Oh! Also, it makes this quiet, but noticeable annoying ticking noise (similar to a loose heat shield) that my mechanic hasn't been able diagnose yet.  Luckily it's paid off. Really, I love this car even after all the problems it's given me, but I think I'm going to buy an older (1998 or more) one next time."
volvo,xc,2002,Kate, 03/22/2008,Upgrade from 850 Wagon,4,"I owned an 850 wagon for one year and loved it! It blew a piston ring and rather than spending the money to fix it, I bought this car. I love it! While it is more luxurious than I am used to, this car will definitely last for 10+ yrs. I bought it with 52k miles at 5 yrs old and it was still eligible for the Volvo used car warranty. So far, no regrets. Though sometimes it feels like the gas needle visibly moves on short (<100 miles) trips. I'm used to a car that gets 30+ mpg though- so maybe that's just me. Volvo improved the cupholders, climate control and internal design significantly and I am happy with my car over all.  This car will go on camping trips, ski trips and paintball trips.."
volvo,xc,2002,Derrick, 07/19/2009,"Ok, but beware",3,"Well we bought the car used, impart because we were just starting our family and with volvo you think safe. Thankfully we also put out for a three year 30k warranty. Good thing we did, because had we not we would have ended up putting over $5000 into the thing. Would not recommend buying used!! These cars were not built to go even 150K, we are just hoping to nurse it till we are no longer upside down and can dump the thing. "
volvo,xc,2002,Lincoln Millstein, 10/26/2002,XC headache,1,"From Day 1,I have had a vibration at 
high speeds (50 plus) with my XC. The 
Volvo field rep said it probably 
was a defective axle. He also 
recommended that I get my car serviced 
at another dealer, saying that my 
dealer had a sub-par service dept. The 
second dealer changed all four tires 
and declared the problem solved. Except 
that I still have a vibration. I called 
the field rep back, but he doesn't 
return my call. Meanwhile I have made 
three calls to customer service at 1-

volvo,xc,2002,JohnD, 01/05/2009,Fell Apart,3,"Until two months ago, I'd agree with the other posts - great car, despite price, some quality issues, and constant new tires.  Then we hit 75,000 miles and the car fell apart.  New suspension.  New transmission.  New power steering rack.  New fuel pump.  New fuel sensors (stalled on interstate twice!).  Went to Consumer Reports and saw the bad news - as this car ages, the reliability ratings get blacker and blacker, and we haven't even gotten to the ""drive train"" and ""electrical system"" black-dot problems.  I loved this car and now can't drive it across town without worrying that the wheels will fall off."
volvo,xc,2002,Bruce, 05/25/2009,Good Used car,4,"I bought an Ocean Race.   We have seen alot of front-end work.  Ball joints, springs, struts, cv axles - had to be replaced.    Fit & Finish is decent.  Engine timing belt, coolant sensor, plugs, and transmission must be maintained.    Right angle gear - watch the oil and seals -- Expensive to replace!!!  We need a good car for family of four.  Volvo seems to imply Big $ at mechanic shops.   Do all the work myself, save maintenance $.   New xc70 are over-priced..   "
volvo,xc,2002,supra727, 04/20/2011,Worst vehicle I have ever owned.,2,My parents and I have all have this model Volvo. We have all had to put thousands of dollars into them since we bought them. My parents bought theirs brand new. I purchased mine used. Everything from transmission problems to cosmetic and computer issues. We have had it all. The only thing I will give this car is that its good in the snow with a great pair of winter tires. I will never ever buy another Volvo. Trading this car in next week for a Lexus is 250 awd :) Can't wait for this money pit to be out of my driveway. 
volvo,xc,2002,nemery, 03/05/2002,Volvo 2002 V70 XC,4,"Being a strong BMW straight six fan, I find the engine in the new XC to perform smoothly and evenly with fair power delivery. There is a little turbo thrust & roughness when shifting out of 1st on a hard acceleration. So far I've had no problems. It was a toss up between this and the BMW 325 IX wagon. The BMW is a little more solid and handles better although it is smaller & not as versatile."
volvo,xc,2002,JJWMack, 03/31/2003,A lot of money for the car...,3,"For a $40k car, it has not lived up to 
the hype.  And forget about the 
customer service where we had 
purchased.  Have had problems with head 
lamps and directional lamps, 
broken/clogged washer fluid lines, etc. 
Nice drive, nice looking car, but 
quality was surprising for such a 
pricey car.  Not totally disappointed, 
but also which I had known about the 
very sad trade-in value.  Lost over 10K 
just driving off the lot."
volvo,xc,2002,NAsh, 09/07/2007,The Swedish Warrior,5,"""Vidar"" the XC is a great boy. We have owned several Volvos during the past 20 years and this is our first Volvo we have owned since Ford took over. However, we have been surprised that Ford has not influenced Volvo at all. This car drives, handles, and has the same mannerisms as our previous Volvos. This car continues to bring me back to the reason why I bought my first Volvo in Sweden 20 years ago. It's roomy, practical, fuel efficient (about 23 avg.), and a car that you are always happy to get into. Knowing that Volvo has never let me down on trips and is one of the safest cars on the road always reassures me why I purchase them. Don't let just any mechanic work on a Volvo."

design, feature and comfort are all 
great.  The quality of my XC is just 
terrible.  3000 miles oil change, 
service dept. discovered an oil leak, 
it took 4 days to fix.  Just after 7500 
miles check up, ABS system went bad and 
had to be replaced somewhere.  Gas low 
warning on sometimes, not everytime.  
Talked to the dealer's service dept. 
and was told that European cars are 
temperamental.  I owned a Japenese car 
before, never was surprised, maybe that 
is too boring.  XC never is short of 
excitement."

summer. I arranged for the car to be 
delivered to a dealer other than the 
one from which it was purchased. Once 
the car finally arrived (EIGHT weeks 
later), the dealer (Rickenbaugh, 
Denver) was very rude and unhelpful.  
Because the car was not purchased at 
their dealership, they claimed, taking 
delivery of my car was more of a 
headache for them than it was worth.  
They did not check the car over as 
promised by Volvo. Additionally, the 
car sustained significant damage in 
shipping, and the marine insurance
claimed the damage was regular wear 
and tear. Only after many emails they 
finally sent me a check."

In fact I almost returned it but ignored my instinct to do so.To their credit Carmax has taken care of all the problems under their 30-day warranty. So far, new brakes and rotors, drivers side headlight, numerouis electrical problems, numerous bulb replacements and the list goes on and on and, did I mention numerous electrical problems? The ride is great, it's comfortable and safe but, the build quality is poor and I'm now convinced the long term reliability of this car is just not there. Consider another car-this is my second and last Volvo. I'm going to trade it in for a BMW."

I have owned this car for just three weeks now and I know I am a guy and I am supposed to like my car but I really like this XC70.  I have driven my Father XC90 across country (US) and yes it is very nice, but I live in San Francisco, the closest I get to off-road is skiing in Tahoe.  It is quite nimble.  This engine is designed to compete on the German Autobahn.  The 5 speed automatic transmission steers up the right amount of turbo boast to propel you from 60 to 90 mph faster than you can say C-H-P.  With 39.8 of head room I fit.  The rear mounted CD 10 pack is a must."

volvo,xc,2002,xc70driver, 11/13/2002,"Very safe, but reliable?",3,"We bought the XC because we feel it's 
about THE safest car on the road today.

Almost returned the car because of some 
problems, the worst of which was a 
vibration caused by the tires. 4 new 
tires were put on which solved the 
problem.  Other XC owners have had this 
problem and I think Pirelli made a bad 
batch of tires although I have no proof 
to back that up. Go to www.xc70.com for 
info on this and more.

With the vibration fixed, we are very 
satisfied with the car. If AWD 
isn't important, I'd recommend the V70 
2.4T (cheaper, nicer ride, better gas 
mileage but otherwise the same car). VW 
Passat is nice option too (maybe not 
quite as safe, but more reliable.)"

volvo,xc,2002,ct, 06/20/2002,XC in CT,3,"Car's comfortable...very, in fact.  Not 
performance oriented and, given its 
height, there's roll on the turns.  

Transmission is strange as well.  Long 
delays before it downshifts and finds a 
gear when accelerating hard from, say 
30mph.  But otherwise fine.  If you're 
looking for a sporty wagon, this 
probably isn't the best choice.  Go for 
a T5 or an Aero.  We needed 4wd and 
sacrificed performance for comfort and 
safety - that's where this car shines.

Seats and stereo are great.  Great for 
long highway drives. Much better than a 
truck."

clearance (my other cars are a Jeep 
Grand Cherokee Ltd. and a MPV minivan), 
VERY quiet interior (I love to listen 
to music in the car) and tons of luxury 
features. I got the Cold Weather

2002 Volvo XC Wagon has to top the 
list. By far this is the best riding and 
most comfortable Volvo I have driven. 
The car has a nice ""elevated"" drive 
affording the driver a clear veiw of the 
road. As a long drive car it is 
excellent, with a smooth ride  and  an 
extensive list of creature comforts.
The seats are by far some of the 
most comfortable I have 
experienced.  The AWD is a nice 
feature and when called on 
responds very well. For soccer 
mom's looking for an SUV with top 
end luxry without driving a tank this 
car certainly fills the void. A great 
family car!"
volvo,xc,2002,DHH, 01/27/2003,The wagon that thinks it's an SUV,5,"This car has done everything we've 
asked it to do, and more. We use it as 
an all-around hauler. From family 
vacations, to every day use, it's 
extremely comfortable and roomy.

Recently, I was hauling a 14-foot 
trailer, which was loaded with about a 
foot of snow. I had to take it down a 
dirt road, which was covered with about 
18"" of snow. Despite these obstacles, 
this car plowed through it like 
nothing. Any questions I had about this 
cars' ability to get down and dirty 
were forever vanquished that day.

I would highly recommend this car to 
anyone considering an SUV, but would 
really have a wagon."

we bought it, we needed a car with good 
fuel economy, excellent handling, all 
wheel drive, and lots of power.  The 
Turbo on the XC is fantastic, goes up 
the steepest grades without the 
slightest hesitation.  The build 
quality is as solid as a tank, and the 
engine performs great at all speeds.  
We own a sequoia also, and I feel just 
as safe--if not safer in this car when 
driving in the snow.  The all wheel

anything.  We have just over 11,000

This Volvo will do just about anything better than the  VW.  Power is the only area we noticed  a sacrifice.  Fit and finish are as good or better than any car we looked at , i.e. Toyota Highlander,  Lexus RX 300 and VW Passat 4Motion.  I have never felt as safe in a car in my life.  We drive this vehicle with confidence.  This car has Road Trip written all over it.  Volvo costs a little more than others but as we found out , it's worth every cent.

If you give it enough gas she will really get moving too! clocked about 0-60 in 8 seconds, not bad for 190,000 miles that it has today. the car is also super comfortable, leather seats and heating makes any drive awesome. The issues I have with the car are that we bought it used and the repairs. The previous owner towed with the car so we needed to replace odd things like the bevel gear. Since it is so old, it needs repairs quite often which are usually several hundred dollars. In conclusion, the car is really fun to drive, safe, can be $$$"

The A/C is outstanding in 100 degree temps and still get 19 mpg in the city. We compared this vehicle to the Audi All- Road & BMW Wagons, both were over- priced; and the Range Rover which had too many poor maintenance & gas mileage reviews.

One thing after another went wrong with the wagon... one year after buying it, the ignition went (sometimes the key would come out, other times it was stuck!)!  The ball joints, brakes and rotars were shot.  How many times do you have to replace a headlight bulb?!!  The straw that broke the camels back:  the angle bracket, which cost $2,500!!  The car was constantly in the shop, and it was never inexpensive to repair!!  We bought this as our family car... Volvo for life?  We finally got rid of it and bought a Toyota Highlander Limited!!"

I can beat most any ricer before it get crazy and ride in style, haul my drums in any weather.  SAFE!  Flush your trans now, change oil every 3k, change timing belt, pinion gear oil. Do as much schedule maint. as you can yourself. Check underneath for leaks, don't ignore warning lights.  Better yet get a code reader.

So far the car starts everytime, but with angle gear replacement, brake booster failure, and miscelleanous odds and sods, I have enjoyed the $8,000+ repairs covered by the extended warranty ZI bought.  The fit & finish however are superb, the ride is the best barco lounger for the long haul.. nobody makes a better seat.

the most versatile Volvo yet. Slight 
harshness under acceleration but can 
get used to it."
volvo,xc70,2004,tsumami, 08/12/2011,I am in love with my car,5,"I recently was lucky enough to find a 2004 Volvo XC70 2.5T AWD with only 71K miles , fully loaded and in near mint condition.
I have driven Volvos in the past and have wanted another one for years, the XC70 has been on my wish list since that model became available. I was truly amazed by the fact that it handles like a sports car but has the practicality of a station wagon. It handles like a dream on bad roads and gets amazing fuel mileage for this type of vehicle. I recently took it on a road trip and got 31 mpg with the a/c on and driving 75 mph. It is obvious that the former owner took very good care of the vehicle so I was very lucky to find it.

volvo,xc70,2004,shiner42, 05/23/2015,Best car I have ever owned!,5,"I have always loved the way the XC70 has looked. Even now that I have owned it for about 10 years it still looks new. Yes I have taken care of the paint and plastic on the exterior. Yes I have tried to take care of the inside to. Yet I lived for three years where it got to 40 degrees below zero. The paint... Looks like new. Other than a few dings and scratches it looks great. The interior looks great except for the driver seat. I tried to take care of it with regular cleaning and conditioning but the leather cracked and now has holes in it. But other than that it survived the brutile winters. The all wheel drive is second to none. Made it to placeses even jeeps could not go. Great vehicle.

volvo,xc70,2004,Bruce in Charlotte, 08/14/2016,Former Volvo for Lifer who own's two xc-70 wagons,2,"I own 2 xc70 wagons. One is a 2004 with approximately 192,000 miles. I write approximately because the ABS module went on the car and the odometer stopped working. The brakes work fine and the abs actually works but the abs and brake lights warnings are constantly on. Charlotte Volvo quoted me $1700 to replace the ABS module. The control arm bushings were worn after nine years and dealer estimated repair at $761. Similiarly spring seats and strut bearing also worn and dealer estimated repair at $523. I declined repair and its been 4 years and the wheels have not fallen off. 

If you buy this model expect to be continually replacing the light bulbs. I have had the same problem with the 2007 so the cars seem to be plagued with electrical problems. 

Positives about the car- the engine is great, the turbo works well and the car is very comfortable. 

The 2007 has  also had electrical problems. The radio died and Volvo wanted $700 to replace. I purchased an aftermarket. Two years after the radio was installed I had problems with the electrical system and with the on- board computer. On sporadic occasions I would start car, the radio would come on but climate controls would not work, dash would not illuminate and power locks and windows would not work. I would shut car off and re-started and everything would turn back on. After Volvo replaced two on-board computers, Volvo tech told me that the after market radio was causing the on board computer to fail. Even though all wiring was correct Volvo tech recommended disconnecting after market radio. Volvo claims aftermarket radio will not work in Volvo's.

Other problems. The cataletic converter sense went after three years ownership. I have been told this is a very common problem with Volvo's. Another $600 service. Dash warning lights seem to come on and then go off for no reason. Dealership has told me that there is nothing mechanically wrong with the car but it is plagued with minor electrical problems. 

I cannot in good conscience recommend this model car or any Volvo. I have owned three Volvo wagons and the 07 is the last Volvo I will ever purchase. The best thing about Volvo's were the 5 cylinder Volvo turbo engines. I suspect the electrical problems that have plagued all 3 of my Volvo wagons will continue in the new Volvo's.

volvo,xc70,2004,Kevin, 11/09/2010,What a great Car,4,I was looking for a decent used AWD car for the winter. I purchased this XC70 and I'm totally blown away. I like this 2004 XC70 better than my New  2009 Honda accord. Wish i had bought a volvo sooner..XC70 wagon is a great addition..  
volvo,xc70,2004,papatony, 01/15/2010,Great Car,4,"Bought it used with 92kmiles.  This car is probably the best I have owned (VW, BMW, Toyota, Honda and Infiniti).  The key is that it is a car that can be everything (sports car, station wagon, SUV, etc.).  It drive fantastic and gives you a great sense of comfort and safety.  It grips the road and goes.  In the big snowstorm we just had, it sped forward regardless of the amount of snow on the road."
volvo,xc70,2004,Jordan, 08/26/2007,Fantastic Car,4,"This is the best all-purpose vehicle you can find.  It does everything, it's fun to drive, it's safe enough for babies and fast enough for dads.  All-wheel drive is the best for all weather conditions I've driven this car through storms, rain, snowstorms, cross country, etc. and never once felt out of control.  The turbocharged engine gives a kick when you need it.  It has nice clearance for hopping curbs or going offroad.   The only semblance of a complaint is that the gas mileage is on the low side, we average 20 mpg in mixed use driving.  But it still beats an SUV in that category.  If you need an all-purpose vehicle, but want better reliability than an SUV, this is it."
volvo,xc70,2004,walterq, 03/24/2008,Needs some work,2,"A lot of road noise, window seals had to be replaced 2x's, still inadequate.  When they replaced window seals, primer damaged paint.  Radio and interior music enjoyment is terrible.  Bearings (3) went at 51,000 miles, 1000 miles over warranty."
volvo,xc70,2004,Kelster2, 07/25/2009,"I""d buy another one !",4,Overall good solid vehicle.  I went from a mercedes to this volvo.  Volvo is more comfortable for my commute and more practical for all those trips to costo and the nursery and the vet. 
volvo,xc70,2004,James Fleming, 10/28/2015,expensive to maintain,3,"I spent an average of $200 per month over 11 years to maintain this car.  Volvo service and part were way to expensive.  Every time I took the car to Stamford CT Volvo for regular service, they always came up with additional expensive repairs.  I bought an extended warranty for $2000 but it did not pay since it id not cover the things that went wrong enough to pay off ( computer stuff for example).
"
volvo,xc70,2004,Mike, 10/18/2008,Stylish and comfortable,4,"We bought this car a couple of weeks back, so can't comment on reliability yet, I just gave it the average of the other ratings.  My wife and I both had liked our old Volvo 740 station wagon, which even at 18 years was still more pleasant to drive than some midsize cars we recently tested. Therefore, we decided to get another Volvo and don't regret it.  Performance is more than adequate. The suspension is actually a bit unrefined; it will tell you exactly about every nook and cranny on the road, but it will never loose composure. The seats are marvellous - after a 5 hours drive, you feel well rested. Most comfortable car I've ever driven.  "

Dealer promised to cover but then reneged. Will never deal with Volvo again. Brakes on car are poor full replacement every 30K miles. Would expect more from the safest car in the world.  Many other cars that are quieter, better mileage and overall more reliable than this. Deeply disgusted "
volvo,xc70,2004,2004 XC Owner, 02/04/2009,AWD Letdown,4,"Been a great car for commuting; awesomely comfortable.  AWD power to rear wheels failed and no warning to alert driver.  Discovered when son observed rear wheels not spining on icy driveway.  Discovered after warranty expired; $2600 repair cost & 3+ wks @ dealer waiting for parts. All the while we've had 3 snowstorms in that time, which is one of the reasons I bought AWD.  Not a happy camper. We've been Volvo family for long time (3 V-series in household now); not sure I'll buy another. BTW, Volvo isn't only mfr w/AWD problems - do internet search on ""AWD problems"""
volvo,xc70,2004,J.R. , 02/25/2006,Best of the Breed,4,"With the exeption of mediocre service from the dealer, this is an excellent car. Lots of Winter driving on back roads; good control; comfortable; more interior carrying space that all of the mid-sized SUV's we've driven; no comparison to the XC90 which is tinny and poorly assembled. I've had Jeeps (dumped two before they had 30k), Subaru's (not bad, but just not as good), Pathfinders (the '94 was the bes); Saabs (100 mph up the hill in my drive, standing still); Recommend this car."
volvo,xc70,2004,tenmiler, 05/23/2007,Soccer mom car does me proud,4,"I'm sorry to be leaving the lease on this car. It's been fantastic, with nothing going wrong other than a turbo boost that was fixed under warranty, and I had never noticed it. This car is GREAT in the mountains, with the turbo at high altitude being a gem. The AWD could use the stability control, but I felt safe in this car. It's no sports car, but it's comfortable, quiet, and reliable. And I'm not a soccer mom!"
volvo,xc70,2004,tobybul, 01/12/2018,Over rated!! But better than expected,5,"Not sure why this car and brand is highly rated. I work on my cars and I find it over-engineered, complicated and behind in technology. The first thing I noticed are the door lock actuators are motor driven instead of solenoids!! As a result they don't last long and are a PIA to replace. The dealer wants at least $500 to replace them. Second, Their PCV system is so complicated and difficult to maintain it falls under the stupid category IMO. Also, what’s with the analog telephone??? And there are too many systems being monitored that the message center becomes quite annoying. If anything needs to be modified thru the VIDA system dealer wants $$$ for it.

Best car I've ever driven and also best value for the features. Military pricing and home shipment was great! Smooth autobahn car, solid as a rock and quiet through 120 mph. Starts to float above 125 mph, but holds a straight line without drift. Very comfortable seats, huge interior space, great controls. Love the rain sensor, heated mirrors (needed both in Germany).  My first Volvo and I'm very pleased. My next car (10+ years from now) will also be a Volvo. Since the kids will be bigger, I'll be eyeing the S60R."
volvo,xc70,2004,Virginia George, 10/07/2008,A Solid Performer,4,"I bought our 2004 XC70 as a used car with 10,000 miles on the odometer. Over three years of daily driving it, I've become a fan.  The car is surprisingly peppy and agile for a station wagon. It maneuvers easily in high-speed rush hour traffic on D.C.'s Beltway. It's an excellent long- distance cruiser. Front seats are exceptionally comfortable for a long- legged driver like me.  Auto AC works great, year-round. Overall, the car has been very solid and reliable. However, I've replaced more front headlight bulbs on this car than in my prior five cars combined. Only significant defects -- radio controls, lack of foot space in rear seat, lack of storage in passenger compartment."
volvo,xc70,2004,Volvo almost lost me, 11/22/2008,Bought 2 will buy more,4,"I had to dump my 2000 XC because of continuing problems. I almost didn't buy another but my wife wanted to try a new model. I bought a 2004 with 18000 miles. I have to admit. huge change. Good engine power, seats, and lots of room. I have had zero problems with the 2004 and Volvo has kept me around for a few more years. Great in the snow and rain. I actually had to save a friend that got stuck in his Tahoe. Mine just rolled right thru 5 inches of snow, no problem. Hint: you need good tires. XC70 will eat tires if you don't rotate them every 5000 miles."
volvo,xc70,2004,Rossthewrench, 12/28/2008,Electrical problems frequent,4,"We bought this wagon used, it was  always serviced by Volvo, and highway driven by female doctor. The condition was showroom. One week after purchasing, the information centre packed it in. Dealer said it was out of warranty. Cost to replace roughly 1200. So we said to forget it. Next month the instrument panel shut down, no guages at all, no speedometer either. Had the local garage change battery. Was OK, now it is back again. Nothing on instrument panel again. Now we just guess how fast we are going, fill the gas tank often, and hope we are right. Oh, the airbag info light came on just after we got it, neighbour Volvo same problem No warranty.

It does nothing as well as the almost 15 year older car. Big delay from start, bad handling, lighter modern brakes - yuk! The controls are cheap and all work backwards. And then there is the seat which always wants to move away from the last driver when you get in. They even blew the armrests. Blows light bulbs for some strange reason. Gas mileage OK though. Going back to a real european car and getting rid of this Ford!"

the emissions light, then the dome

We've even had it up to 122 MPH while late for a flight and it is rock solid.  Vehicle noise is pretty low compared to our old Tahoe and Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Been skiing in the Alps and had no trouble manuevering in snow, the Winter feature works great.  Pirelli Scorpion STR tires are worth the money. The only thing I really don't like after all is the rain sensing intermittent wipers-- it never seems to be the right amount of wiping for lower speeds and light drizzle.  I've been hit by a motorcycle and I've backed into a post and the repairs were expensive, but car was not totaled, unlike my friends cars.  "
volvo,xc70,2004,d. from denver, 10/26/2006,2/3 the way through my Volvo lease,4,"This car is very stealth; it performs way better than the image it projects. If you get into the turbo, it will leave most everyone else sitting at the stoplight. Very solid build quality so far (at 30k miles). Maintenance not too bad because the major ones covered under warranty, which they no longer do (cheaped out). Run synthetic oil most the time in it."
volvo,xc70,2004,rrscott, 06/18/2003,So little needed to make much better,4,"A good practical car with much improved 
exterior design from earlier models.  
The lack of standard transmission is a 
serious mistake.  The geartronic works 
but the lag in shifting and the 
difficulty in knowing what gear you are 
in is disorienting and limits 
performance.

Driving is very civilized and secure, 
but suffers from lack of feedback to 
driver.  The feeling is of a refined 
car being driven in accord with your 
commands by someone else, rather than a 
sense of the car being an extension of 
oneself."

through their Over Seas Delivery 
program, you save $, they treat you 
like royality and you end up with a 
FANTASTIC car !
I love my XC, summer was great, now in 
the snow the AWD is wonderful, I feel 
so safe ! The seats are the most 
comfortable in the world. To me this 
car is a luxary car in the front and a 
very practical wagon in the back. The 
fit, finish, design, quality are all 
first rate. The only minor negatives I 
have so far are the Xenon lights (too 
dim) and the lack of USA 7 pin wiring 
for your trailer towing. Mileage could 
be better."
volvo,xc70,2004,sindell, 01/17/2004,my favorite wagon,5,"look forward to driving this vehicle.it 
has great road feel, stability,enough

far surpasses my BMW 528 wagon for all

volvo,xc70,2004,01XC/Volvo forever, 02/02/2004,Our second XC,5,"My wife bought a new Cross Country in 
1999, it now has 67,000 miles on it. I 
liked it so much I bought a new one in 
2001, which now has 38,000 miles. 
Initial purchase price on these cars 
was more than we were used to paying 
for a car. However, they are absolutely 
the best cars we have ever owned. No 
problems whatsoever. I believe that 
they are a bargain. Factoring in 
safety, comfort, performance and build 
quality, there is nothing else made 
that comes close. We have taken 4 trips 
to Florida, 3000 miles round trip each 
time. These cars are excellent long 
distance cruisers. "
volvo,xc70,2004,DMR, 02/07/2004,Volvo XC70,5,"This is hands down the best vehicle I 
have ever owned. We chose Volvo because 
of their reputation for being so safe. 
I especially love the XC70 because I am 
only 5'2"" and most SUV's are too big 
for me to handle. This car is the 
perfect match for me. I sit up higher 
than I do in a regular car, I have the 
back room of an SUV, and I don't have 
to worry about rollover issues. Plus 
the AWD is great!"
volvo,xc70,2004,dvalls, 02/13/2004,A True Joy,4,"This is Volvo's best wagon ever.  There is no 
road noice at all, it handles exceptionally well,

wagon is beautiful to look at and has a 
fabulous sound system. I can't say enough 
good things about this car. "
volvo,xc70,2004,WOE, 02/25/2004,First time Volvo Owner,4,"We traded in our BMW 528I with 127,000 
miles on it.  Our criteria was we 
wanted a vehicle to tow a trailer, and 
not be an SUV.  We feel we found it 
with the XC70.  It is rated to tow up 
to 3500 lbs, which is more than we ever 
will.  We have only had it a couple of 
days, and it took a lot to get us from 
BMW, we hope this is the right choice."

XC70.  Great interior, comfort, safety, 
fit & finish & so on.  The one piece 
that absolutely doesn't fit is the 
engine.  The 5 cylinder is noisy and 
rough , simply inappropriate in a car 
that typically stickers out around 
$38K.  Drop the drive train from my 
Acura TL-S into the Volvo and you have 
a home run. Why is Volvo married to 
that #$%&# 5 banger?"

entire engine block had to be replaced

second time it was a fan somewhere in 
the cooling system that causes serious

I need my car to be able to handle well 
in the mountains and on the highway, 
and it does both very well. It grips 
the road for great control on wet or 
dry pavement, plus has great brakes and 
very good acceleration at high speeds. 
I often have 6'+ friends in the car and 
I'm able to fit 3 of them in easily. 
Also, the solid construction allows for 
a quiet ride and the seats are very 
comfortable!"

three. I don't think I will ever buy 
anything else but a Volvo, if for 
nothing else the safety features. I 
drive a very crazy, interstate highway 
everyday and it's nice to know that 
should I be involved in a serious 
accident, there is a high probability 
that I will survive it.

Although not a ""luxury car"" there are 
enough really nice features on the 
V70XC to make it comfortable and a 
dream to drive. 

I average around 22 mpg and use ONLY 93 
octane fuel. So far, we have 
experienced absolutley no problems with 
this car and couldn't be happier with 
our purchase. 5 stars for Volvo!"

the 3rd seat which is great when we

thing I would like to see different is 
Volvo needs to build a similar model

gas mileage.  We do a majority of city 
driving and average 23 mpg.  Also, 
noise level of ride is almost as 
comparable as an SUV, but we have the

car in the S40 class would have yielded 
far more severe injuries. Volvo's 
safety is first class. We chose to 
replace the S40 with another Volvo, 
more family practical vehicle. As much 
as I enjoy my SUV, SUV's cannot compete 
with the XC70.Rides the way we all wish 
SUV's should.Accelerates, brakes&

SUVs  but without the unnecessary bulk
of most major SUVs.  We traded one of
our cars (AUDI A4 Quattro) for this new
XC70 Volvo.  We also considered the
Lexus R330 and Volvo XC90.  We found
these latter two SUVs to be too
tall/high for our ""rescued"" South
Russian Sheepdog to jump in and out of
the vehicle.  We chose the XC70 because
he is able to recline comfortably while
in the car.  The XC70's safety features
also made us choose it over the Lexus
R330.  We would have chosen the XC90 but
 besides the ""height"" situation, we also
found it a little ""too feminine"" looking

driving the XC70 here in the LA area."

volvo,xc70,2004,Blake, 11/12/2005,Can't go wrong,4,"Easily the best car Volvo builds, and that's saying a lot. When it comes to value for the dollar, the ""Cross Country"" can't be beat. There are certainly more expensive and less expensive options out there, but factoring the whole package, it's easy to see why this is such a popular car among middle-class and more affluent buyers. And there is no snobbery that goes with it, like some of those Bavarian makes. You can't go wrong choosing a Volvo ""Cross Country""."

than PF when going into garage for the

used to.  Tranny rough at slow speeds

Excellent hiway car.  Adequate power.

great option over an SUV.  After

This is my 3rd Volvo and the worst one so far. From the driver door coming open while I was driving twice to gas shooting in my face due to a faulty gas line and cut off. I think I would have been better off with a car that is 20 years old. My car is now inactive again ( every month) because of a faulty trans. Do you think that Volvo or the Volvo dealership will take it back. NO! It is a lemon but of course in PA the lemon law is so crazy that I can't do anything with this car but to leave it in my driveway, due to the numerous times that it breaks down and put myself and my family at risk. So buyer beware"
volvo,xc70,2005,camnate, 07/19/2012,The best car I have ever owned!,4,"Ok so I baught this vehicle from my brother with 75k,
he bought the vehicle with 51k and he had all scheduled maintenance done. I have kept up with the majore ones. I have no idea about the previous owner. This car has never left me stranded and rides like a dream! my wife loves it! 130k miles and still runs/rides perfect. There are the occasional minor fixes that will set you back a few hundred but really. as the car gets older even an extra $1200 year minor fixes is well worth it..
you can drive it for 20 years! The engine is iron clad (2.5 5cy) and it still drives like its on glass. tires are a pain, and MPG could be better but treat it right and will pay dividends!"
volvo,xc70,2005,VolvoXCdriver, 05/19/2016,Volvo - For Life,5,"I loved my 2005 Volvo XC70. Everything about the car screamed quality. The swedes know how to build a car - the leather on the seats is very thick, very little plastic is used, and metal covers the exterior of the car. As much as I loved the car, I did have some issues with it. 1st, the siren went out and caused the sunroof to stop working (if you don't believe me, google it), and the check engine light came on once because the gas cap needed to be replaced. Neither of these issues cost very much money to fix, however.  The car did have a little over 100,000 miles, so a few repairs are acceptable since Volvo cars will outlast any others if you take care of them. The other thing that I didn't like about the car was its fuel economy. I was averaging 21 MPG - might as well get an XC90. This car is really for those of us who don't buy into the SUV craze, but still need a light off-road vehicle with plenty of cargo space. The thing that really won me over on Volvo was safety. I know that in my XC70, I can rest assured knowing that I drive the safest car in the world. Look up ""Volvo saved my life"" and read the stories (CAUTION: You will never be able to drive another non-Volvo car if you do this :)  I got a great deal on this car so I only bought it to re-sell it, but I ended up falling in love with the car. I would recommend the XC70 to anyone - in fact, I am buying a 2006 XC70 to replace my 2014 Camry Hybrid.

volvo,xc70,2005,Rick Pascal, 05/10/2016,I love my XC70,5,"First of all, it's a beautifully styled car, very comfortable and great on gas mileage...27-29 highway and about 22 locally on regular gasoline.  Excellent acceleration. Very spacious cargo area.  I've had mine since 2005 and have over 115,000 miles; I feel it will go another 115,000 easily.  Virtually no maintenance problems.  Service recommendations are at 7500 miles but I change oil every 3750 miles.  Body is still in fantastic condition; no rust or wear.  Leather seats have worn beautifully.  I would recommend this car very highly.  
The only downside is that I wish there were a compass in the dashboard and a bigger place to hold sunglasses.

Volvo offers a great deal for European Delivery, too.  They'll give you two round trip tickets to Gothenberg, Sweden plus a night's stay in a hotel.

Volvo has done to the car, what NASA has succeeded to the space shutle, Long trips, comfortable, controls keep you company, they do everything without talking to you and at night they even relax your eyes, perfect ballance  weight configuration, superb modulus of elasticity of the metal, sound and vibration minimal (dont feel it), not hard and stiff like the Mercedes or BMW, and soft like Lexus and most important it still caries the secret that only VOLVO owners know."
volvo,xc70,2005,gbs, 04/14/2010,"Great car, lousy tire options and MPG",4," I bought my XC70 as a certified used car. I had previously owned an Audi A6 wagon, which was a tank. The Audi drove better at highway speeds, had a vastly superior stereo. But I have to say, I love the Volvo's style, excellent front seats, storage capability. What I don't like: Perelli tires which need to be replaced every 30K miles or so. haven't found a suitable replacement that tire cos will actually put on the car due to safety ratings and sizing issues. And since I do mostly city driving, the mpg is lousy. Overall, glad it was pre- certified. Have saved much $$$ having the dealer take car of stuff. I'd recommend the XC70. "

She can have the FX, I love the XC70!  The XC70 rides very smoothly, has plenty of power, especially at high speeds, has incredible grip especially in snow, and has a huge trunk.  I like the look as well.  I bought the premium package and the interior materials are very nice, the stereo is great too.  The gas mileage is average, however.  We don't have kids but Ii have no problem driving a station wagon.  I grew up in Europe and station wagons are in there.  Here, there is a stigma about driving a station wagon. Great ride."

Many people would say that wagons are lame, but this car has POWER. Fuel economy is just like any other Crossover SUV. The style is awesome. I wish mine had the Third row jump seat. And the nav.

volvo,xc70,2005,Gail, 03/13/2010,A Winner for the Long (and Large) Haul,4,"I purchased this wagon for Michigan winters and it has been wonderful.  I hate vans and SUVs so this was a great way to transport kids, snowboards, and weaving looms but then also have some dignity and style.  It has been perfectly reliable and made winter driving a joy for this transplant from NC.  The only change I'd make is the digital clock that tends to speed up and is difficult to set exactly.  The car doesn't get super mileage, but the tradeoff is a heavy, safe and sturdy vehicle that I will keep hopefully as long as my last Volvo (15 years!!)

Don't be concerned about fuel consumption during the break-in period as it improves significantly. MPG during first 1000 miles was about 14/20 city/highway, now averaging 18/24 after 5000 miles and still improving. Initial thirst followed by major improvement in fuel consumption after break-in is a common Volvo characteristic. Build quality and fit/finish are excellent."
volvo,xc70,2005,debbie, 06/10/2005,XC 70 is the best,5,This car is comfortable and easy to drive. I feel safe in it and we can haul most anything in the back.  It is great on long trips.  It is not like a huge SUV but you get the same feel as an SUV without the bulk.  I don't feel like I'm in a station wagon either.  It is the best of everything.
volvo,xc70,2005,California, 06/23/2005,Great Compromise Mileage/Clearance,5,"A very good decision to buy this car.  I usually keep my cars for 10 years. Bought this car nine months ago and have put on 8,500 miles. I commute in this car and have taken it off-road and on the sand dunes. It works great in all environments and gets very good mileage for a versatile vehicle (average 21 mpg+). The driver and passenger seats are very comfortable for long trips and off-road. Very reliable so far and the dealer maintenance is great. Not a gas guzzeling SUV and much better than a station wagon. Ya gotta love this cross-over vehicle. Best of several worlds. Also, rated as a very safe vehicle in all types of collissions"

volvo,xc70,2006,Gabriel Welch, 12/18/2016,Great Vehicle! But...,4,"I purchased my 2006 Volvo XC70 at a local auto auction with 137,000 miles on it. The Volvo was a workhorse! I drive my cars fast and hard and the Volvo took a beating. It was fast and smooth. The Volvo was also extremely comfortable. The car was versatile and fun to drive. The Volvo never left me stranded or let me down! It was very reliable however, It had some finicky electrical issues from time to time. Parts for the Volvo are never readily available and they are very expensive. If you plan on keeping up on maintenance you're going to need some deep pockets. The frequency and cost of maintenance on a car like this is insane! I owned a Mercedes Benz previous to the Volvo that was less expensive to maintain. But if you take care of the Volvo, it will take care of you.

It's been great, but.... now at 75k, I've had two sets of tie rod issues again, and I'm starting to wonder how many repairs I'll be facing after 100k. The design, comfort and performance of this car are outstanding. In exchange, you will be buying a very touchy and expensive car to maintain. My advice? If you don't mind spending all your discretionary income on car repairs and $$$$maintenance, and you live near a Volvo dealer, you'll love this car.

They're great performing vehicles and God-awful reliable!  The aspect that I don't like is that I have to use premium grade fuel!

volvo,xc70,2006,Alphonso, 08/03/2017,WOULD OWN A DOZEN MORE OF THESE CARS!!!!,5,"As reliable as the day is long!!  I bought this car because I loved the 240 GL that we used to own!!  After buying it, I learned to love  it, too!  I quickly realized that it had poor resale value, but that was after the fact.  But, after developing a network of those to depend upon in case of problems, I understood that in the 55,000 miles that I've owned this car, it hasn't let me down ONCE!!  I had to have the front axles replaced by a private mechanic, a wear and tear item and a radiator, again a wear and tear item.  Other than that, I've just had to follow the owner's manual and it's been a fabulous ownership experience...and I bought this car with 82,000 miles on it!!  On the road, there is nothing like it!  It handles superbly and securely!  It actually inspires confidence!  It's our 'road trip' vehicle because of the confidence that it inspires!  I am totally happy with my 2006 XC70, but I tend to shy away from the dealership because of their excessive repair costs.  Volvo should outlaw their dealership repair network because they are not consumer friendly AT ALL price-wise! That’s probably why these vehicles have such poor resale value.  I am disappointed in this vehicle's resale value, but that behooves me with buying my next Volvo!  As I learned from an old Army buddy of mine, “take care of your equipment and it'll take care of you!”  Can't say enough good about my XC!!  I would DEFINITELY buy another Volvo (used car) since I have my repair network in place....outside of the dealership!

It took 18 months to get the problem corrected.  At 32,000 miles something internally damaged the engine head, and it needed replacement.  It was repaired under warranty, but the car simply does not perform like it did prior to the problem. This all happened even after being religous about meeting service and oil change intervals, etc.  I love the look of the car inside and out but the Volvo quality and service have alot to be desired. I say this after having six Volvos over the last 20+ years, the first four running over 100,000 miles with few problems. The last two (both XC70) with nothing but problems."

We do our regular oil changes and maintenance and it just goes anywhere we wish to take it! Today - at around 41K miles - we are shopping around for our first new set of tires. The Pirelli's that came with the car were OK, but we're going to put some Michelin's on to see how we like those better.

The radio has a short, which isn't repairable, only replaceable for around $800, and after market stereos can't be installed on Volvos due to a proprietary design. "

If I can't open the hatch for some reason, I'm really going to be stuck because I won't be able to remove my Scooter.

volvo,xc70,2007,Dave, 05/21/2016,"2007, The Best Year for XC70",5,"My current 2007 XC70 is my second; the first was 2004.  All prior model year problems (e.g. transmission) seem to have been fixed on the 2005-2007 model years and '07 was the last year before Ford made Volvo cost reduce the vehicle and substitute the problematic Mitsubishi OEM T6 engine for Volvo's bulletproof 2.5T.  

I now have 195K miles on this car and, after looking unsuccessfully to find a replacement that I like as well or better, decided to refurbish this unit with new strut assemblies, control arms and ball joints and CV axle assemblies in the front and new shocks in the rear.  Prior repairs had been limited to replacing the steering wheel position sensor ""clock spring"" at 148K, fuel rail pressure sensor at around 160K, and the front oxygen sensor at 170K.  

I also completed a tune up with new plugs and coil packs and I replaced the engine temperature sensor and thermostat assembly because MPG readings were intermittently lower than the usual 19-20 city 25-26 highway.  An easy, inexpensive project for us home gamer wanna be mechanics.

Now, at almost 195K miles, the car starts, runs, and drives down the road as new.   Seats still look practically new.  The chassis is tight and free of rattles.  All in all, a very solid and well built vehicle - very comfortable, big storage in back, and tight if not razor sharp European style handling.  I particularly admire the 2.5T engine.  Torque peak at 1,900 rpm is right at 55mph where you need it for passing.  Light boost turbo maintains power at altitude, yet runs nicely on US regular 87 octane gas - unlike Mercedes, Audi, etc.

Good sound system, comfortable seats, intuitive controls, great visibility, sure handling, and higher ride height that makes for easier in/out for us older guys plus eliminates annoying scrapes in front while parking (and you northerners don't plow snow with the front bumper unless it's well over six inches).

My only niggle with this vehicle is road noise which can be an issue with most aggressive tread patterns.  Pirelli's P7 AS plus and, just recently, Bridgestone's Turanza Serenity - both highly rated Grand Touring tires - are as quiet as they come with crisp handling and commendable grip in all conditions.  However, I was disappointed in the durability of the Pirelli, the quieter of the two, so recently switched to the Bridgestone Serenity.  We shall see how well they hold up as they age in terms of noise level.

I've considered a newer xc70, but learned that about one in 25 of Volvo's 3.2 six cyl motors bought in from Mitsubishi experiences excessive oil burn, leading to ring & piston only (no cyl wall scoring) or total engine replacement.  Volvo dealers might tell you that Volvo offers a 4yr/48K mile extended powertrain warranty if you buy a used unit from a dealer; otherwise, good luck.

To those thinking about buying a 2005-2007 XC70 used, I would say this:  Plan on spending $3-4 thousand in refurbishment cost at around 175-180k miles, including front suspension refresh and all the key sensors - fuel rail pressure, engine temp sensor (comes with thermostat assy as a kit), and both oxygen sensors in the exhaust string.  With these preventive failure points covered, it will likely serve you well for a long time to come.

Otherwise, you can buy a 2015.5 or 2016 XC70 with the award winning low boost 2.0L 4 cyl engine, which is based on Ford's 2.0 liter block.  That is a Volvo engineered engine that I look forward to owning as soon as I can get the right 2016 xc70 unit for under $20K.

Finally, if you read the owner blogs Dealers are often referred to as ""the Stealership"".  I've found them capable but very expensive.  Could be worse if you have a Mercedes or Audi.  I've found an excellent Indy nearby who works with me by letting me source parts (OEM manufacturer without the Volvo label) myself from FCP Euro or Eeuroparts.
"
volvo,xc70,2007,James, 10/09/2016,Go for it!,5,"I bought this car with 99,600 miles on it and paid $9,995, capitalizing on its fairly low resale value.  Since then, I've put over 31,000 miles on it in just a year.  While my fuel economy has not been impressive, especially coming from a 2011 Outback, I have been impressed with what the XC70 has to offer.  Mid-way through the first year I was hit with some high repair costs, as a rear wheel bearing, front ball joint and a tie rod needed to be replaced.  I was initially upset, but once I got the car back all of the things that annoyed me driving it had been fixed!  Sometimes ignorance is not bliss.  Who knew?  This past summer I was living/working in Montana, and took this thing on countless miles of forest service backroads.  It handled things I honestly thought it wouldn't be able too, including an accidental trip on a 4WD only road.  If you're looking at this year range for an Outback or XC70, I would recommend the Volvo.  You can get a lot more for your money in terms of packaging, material quality and comfort.  However, be ready to spend more time as the gas station using premium and the potential for higher maintenance costs.  That being said, I have had no real issues in a year and a lot of the maintenance is easy enough to do on your own and save tons of money.

Two year update: 
Somehow this car has gotten better with age. Now with 150K on the odometer, it honestly drives better than the day I got it. I had to replace the rear suspension at the beginning of the summer but with the car being 10 years old and me constantly overloading it, I wasn't surprised. I would 100% buy this car again and am putting off getting a new outback because I love it so much. Go for it!

I thought there was not comparison between the Volvo and the Outback....I know the Outback has a good reputation, but the XC70 has blown me away (imagine moving from a 1993 4-runner to a 2007 XC70).  It is such a joy to drive, and although I can't compare it to other cars in its class, I think it handles and rides incredibly.  It is so solid and quiet and the interior is like sitting in your favorite leather chair.   "
volvo,xc70,2007,maggiemay, 10/29/2009,A Smooth Ride,4,"This is my first experience with Volvo and after having driven the XC-70 for two years, I submit this review. The XC-70 is a wonderful machine with an incredibly smooth ride for a wagon. I feel very safe in this vehicle and the weight of the XC-70 surrounding me evokes a secure feeling. The XC-70 handles well in inclement weather and is easily maneuvered when quick action is required. For comfort and safety, I would recommend this model to any couple who loves to travel by auto. Would not recommend it if back seat passengers are often along -- too cramped.For safety and reliability, I would say it is second to none.   "

volvo,xc70,2007,crustyjef2, 05/01/2012,Worst car I ever owned,2,"We purchased this car hoping to get well into 6 figures on the mileage.
Well within 2000 miles of the warranty expiring i am incurring $8000 in repairs.
Failed water pump and timing belt and then the transmission failed.
Volvo and dealership seem to care less.
I get it that i am outside the warranty, but come on Volvo! 2000 miles?"
volvo,xc70,2007,EXC-2285, 11/30/2007,GL's XC70,5,"This vehicle is a great car, and saved lives twice. It always loves to get up and go and has almost been like family. They should not have redesigned for 2008. It has been through 2 5 car pile-ups, and saved my 3 friends their lives. This car is truly amazing. I would recommend Volvo to anyone looking for a life-saving vehicle.The XC70 is a beautiful legend."
volvo,xc70,2007,Peter , 05/10/2008,Great All Around Car,4,"I have owned my Volvo XC 70 for one year. In this time, I have come to really appreciate its engineering and design. It gives me excellent service and performance without any compromise. It handles beautifully in town and on the freeway. Its 5 cylinder motor with turbo gives me plenty of power when I need it. It has plenty of cargo space and its leather upholstery gives me the comfort I seek. I find it extremely comfortable to drive and its solid construction gives me a sense of security even when driving with heavy truck, and SUV traffic."
volvo,xc70,2007,rdw, 01/09/2009,Disappointed,3,"I leased this car in 10/2006 and purchased the additional service feature on it.  The car has 26K miles on it and I need rotors, brakes, a new side view mirror, alignment, tires and horn.  $1,100 to repair a car that I put $4K down on and have been paying $470/month ever since.  I'm really disappointed and will not get another Volvo.  "
volvo,xc70,2007,Volvoman, 07/19/2008,Can't have it all,3,"2nd Volvo XC 70 for us. Previous was 03, with better mileage (17/26). City driving yields 13mpg, highway never better than 22. Also have had repeated problems with the tire pressure monitoring system--car has been back 3x for service--each time, they tweak, but warning message comes on after 30 minutes on highway. Never in short runs in city.  Earlier they changed sensors, told me to keep tyres infated to 43psi (!)  Now they have changed some electronics-let's see.   "
volvo,xc70,2007,LOVNIT, 02/07/2007,Best car i've ever owned,5,"After researching cars for a year and a half we decided on the XC70 and have never looked back.  This is by far the best car we've ever owned.  Love it on long trips.  The economy is much better than reported (I average 21 city/27 hwy), and there is always more than enough power, even in the mountains!  I have 26K miles on it already and not one issue yet!"
volvo,xc70,2007,Stowe, 04/15/2007,Love our volvo,4,Great fun to drive. Enjoying all the new technology. It is our 6th volvo over 30 years.  
volvo,xc70,2007,langloj, 10/05/2007,Best AWD Wagon on the Market,4,"The car is smooth and responsive, making for a great handling vehicle. It had surprising acceleration for a 5 cylinder. The leather seats are the most comfortable I have ever had in a car. On trips, the longer I drive this car, the more comfortable it gets. The cargo space is enormous. The interior is well laid out and with the leather package and wood trim, very luxurious for a wagon. Best car we've ever had."
volvo,xc70,2007,Yuri, 10/27/2007,Great Vehicle,4,"I owned this wagon for about 9 months and made about 16,000 miles.  Had a few long trips (2,000-4,000 miles).  I love this vehicle!  Its very reliable, especially in complicated driving conditions. Well, Volvo is known about this, but this car is exceptional.  I love to it on sharp bends, especially on wet road.  So far I could make anybody in this conditions feel absolutely safe. It took my wife quite a time to trust this car for she used to drive a family sedan.  She simply could not believe that the car can do such things.  Ive tried to convince her to use it for me to be nor worried about her.  The seats are excellent.  Ive some problems with low back but I can easily drive it."
volvo,xc70,2007,lin, 02/28/2017,"love volvo, not sure about this one...",2,"i had a 1993 240 wagon - no issues other than maintenance. my 2007, however, has had several issues in the first year of ownership (2016-17). yes, it's 9-10 years old but come on...rear back left light console socket burned out/melted in socket and had to replace entire console. suspension spring broke!! major issue - ripped up tire and could have been deadly if i were driving!! local volvo dealership didn't seem concerned at all even though it is dangerous. no recalls so it's not covered! i am having all 4 springs replaced as others have said when one went, so did another at a later time on their car. very $$$! fuel gauge reads half full when i ""fill"" it at the gas station. dealership couldn't find problem.  miss my '93 but its frame was rusted beyond repair.

volvo,xc70,2007,Marie in Atlanta, 08/05/2008,Hate this car,3,"Had the worst experience with this car than any other car I have owned. After 35,000 miles car broke down due to a fuel sensor. Had to wait for 3 hour in over 100 degree wather for Volvo's road side assistance. Had to drive 75 miles to pick up the car only to get almost home for it to break again. Now the back seat seatbelt is not working and have to go up to the dealership again. Paid to have tires rotated, service did not do this. 35000 miles on the car and I need new tires. I do not drive cars hard and we always keep up with oil changes, tire rotation etc. I am a working mom who has to do the school run. However I recently feel every time I get in the car, there is a problem."
volvo,xc70,2007,Jordan, 01/15/2007,You won't know unless you ask,4,"Had tinted window's applied after factory. My kids put the window's down. the windows would not go back up . called dealership. Had to drive to dealership (30 minutes away) in the rain... They got the windows to go back up. They told me not to put the windows down for a week. Decided to apply winter tire package. Waited 1.5 hrs in service. Cost me $1100.00. Drove 20 min away. message comes on tells me I need service on my tires. Call service, I am told they forgot to add the sensors with the tires. This, apparently, is something new and needs to be added for a price of $350.00. I tell them, I'll be back another day. I return. Wait another 1.5 hrs.. Drive 20 min. down the road and message."
volvo,xc70,2007,stella, 01/23/2007,tire sensors,4,"Only owned vehicle for 3 months, Applied winter tire package. There was a problem with the auto accepting the sensors. Dealers could not find out why. The sensors were removed and now have winter tires . They will refund me for the ??sensors??? Car drives well in snow."
volvo,xc70,2007,MF Stack, 06/18/2008,Poor MPG,4,"This is my second Volvo XC70 after the 2004. The 2007 model is on the same chassis, same engine but the miles per gallon are poor. I get less than 14 MPG in the city and about 19 MPG on the highway. I use premium gasoline and my driving pattern is the same as with the 2004 which got at least 22 on the highway and 17MPG in the city. The dealer has tried a few minor tweaks but won't really look into the problem and does not care. I think I bought a lemon as far as gas mileage is concerned. Other features on the wagon are good to great but with gas prices so high, this is not a car to own. "
volvo,xc70,2008,lindsayg, 05/06/2011,Hold out for a T6!,4,"My 2008 XC70 was comfortable, reliable, safe, and VERY roomy.
I liked it so much that I just bought a 2011 XC70 T6 (the Turbo model).
My few ""issues"" with the 2008 were that the suspension was air-ride and was therefore unable to be customized for a tighter ride, the Tiptronic transmission was too slow to react and the brakes were too whimpy for the weight of the car.
ALL those issues have been corrected in the 2011 as if they read my mind.
However, with a good set of snow tires, my 2008 NEVER got stuck, and we had 2 winters of 2-6 foot snow storms.
I went out on roads that hadn't been plowed, through plow piles at the end of my driveway, and it never hesitated. Better than my Jeep!"
volvo,xc70,2008,Antrow, 01/17/2008,Mixed Bag... Love the car but...,3,"The 08 XC70 is very comfortable and has some nice features such as the keyless entry and go, Blind Spot Warning System and power tailgate. It is a nice looking wagon although I am not a fan of the black plastic cladding on the sides. The interior is very comfortable and clean looking.  My car started off with rattles and a clunking and popping sound coming from the front end. Most of the rattles were toned down by the service department. The front end issues has caused the car to be in the shop four times and it is currently there today. It is our first winter storm and I had to drive out Prius to work :-(.  Volvo has been no help with the front end issue. I have 1900 miles on the car."
volvo,xc70,2008,Shoop, 08/16/2015,Great car,5,"Loved this car. Had it for 8 years. Still running well at 170k and going. 
Reading the reviews about leak of power in this engine- don't agree!!! 
Excellent engine, nice and smooth. Girlfriend loves it too! 
T6 much noisier. 
Volvo should continue 3.2L engine.

volvo,xc70,2008,melalbert, 12/27/2011,No Problem(s),4,"Purchased 3-year old 2008 XC-70 with only 39K on odometer and just absolutely love the vehicle. I have been able to transport my wife and I and two teens in absolute comfort all over the East Coast, racking up over 10K miles in six months. Everyone sleeps in comfort in their leather seats as I tool along smoothly over those miles. If this isn't my dream car yet, then don't wake me when it shows up."
volvo,xc70,2008,bigbuddha, 01/26/2008,Middle-of-the-road all around performer,3,"1. The 235 hp engine is high on torque but low on kick. Acceleration comes with pretty noticable noise that is at least two notches louder on the car radio scale (i.e. you have to tune the radio louder by at least that much to hear the same volume) 2. NOTE THIS: in a stop-and-go situation (e.g. congested highway), you may feel not-infrequent jerking. It is as if the auto transmission doesn't know which gear to engage. This is particularly so if you just let go the brake or tap on the gas slightly."
volvo,xc70,2008,Jake, 10/04/2009,Great Car!!!!,4,The XC 70 is one of the best cars that I ever bought. It is amazing on snow/ice. It's just as good as a Subaru on bad condition or if not better. It handles like crazy. I feel very safe in it also. Volvo makes some of the most safest cars. I just love it!!!
volvo,xc70,2008,NYPAULY, 06/13/2008,I like this car,4,"I bought a new XC70 in April, so I haven't had a chance to test it in snow and ice. I do a mix of city and highway driving and have averaged 24 MPG. The car handles well and is nice to drive, although I find the transmission hunting for gears sometimes.  I had heard that the transmission is adaptive so that this may stablilize once it adjusts to my driving style. "
volvo,xc70,2008,luisja, 01/04/2010,At the end of my lease,3,"I am so happy I returned the lease, I've had so many problems with this car that at the end I did not even bother on taking it in to the shop. I would not recommend this car to anybody unless you want to spend every other week at the shop. AC issues, transmission, pieces/hardware coming off outside and inside, thermometer, squeaks and rattles, BLIS system, Park assist, and more. I guess that's the reason why Ford is selling this to the Chinese, too many issues to fix. Check consumer reports and you'll see what I am talking about. On top of all that I've been waiting for Volvo US or the dealer to contact me about my experience but a response never came back."
volvo,xc70,2008,tevis, 04/08/2009,Upgrade,4,"I've only had this car for a few weeks but I love it.  Selected it, narrowly, over a Subaru Outback Limited because of the extra rear seat room and trunk space.  This car has a beautiful fit and finish, both inside and out.  The controls are well laid out and ergonomic.  It lacks good acceleration but the engine has real power on the highway.  It's no sports car, but drives nicely, is quiet, and luxurious.  After suffering through five years with an Audi Allroad that was a mechanical nightmare (just say no!) I am expecting a much better experience with this car.  So far, so good.  "
volvo,xc70,2008,revolver, 08/21/2008,"Overall, Not Bad",3,"We've had Volvo sedans before, put this is our first wagon. It's a tank. I can't imagine a sturdier, more substantial vehicle. It's outstanding in rain and you're 100% confident in matters of traction and handling all the time. Amazingly comfortable overall. My issues? A perpetual rattle in the cargo area. Had it serviced, but the fix lasted only one day. Going back in again soon. Mileage? I had to shut off the display so I wouldn't cry- -long stretches on local roads at 6MPG. I probably average 16MPG overall. Would I recommend it? Yes, but think hard if you're mostly puttering around town because of the mileage."
volvo,xc70,2008,Effigy3, 09/09/2008,Respectible ride,4,"My previous 7 vehicles were VWs so changing to Volvo was a leap. I had an S40 T5 AWD for 6 months before ""surprise"" 2nd child arrived. Traded for the XC70 for the added room. The ride on this car is excellent for it's class. It feels more like a luxury sedan and less like an SUV. Compared to my previous Passats it feels much roomier which is great for our family of 4. The built-in DVD players are a big hit! (DVD+R work just fine.) It's exactly the kind of solid, thoughtful, classy vehcile that I would expect from a Volvo. I average 18 mpg under mixed driving conditions (22 mpg higway) using a responsible ""kids in the car"" driving style and 89 octane gas."
volvo,xc70,2008,Paul U., 12/09/2008,More than happy,4,"Just upgraded my 08 XC70 with a new 08 XC70.  Added more options, like Dyna audio, BLIS, Adaptive cruise and 17"" wheels. Chose Black/Black instead of Oyster/Tan. It feels like I am in a completely different car. Where the other one was nice, this feels more like a luxury automobile. I am so much happier with this car. My first was an early production and this one seems to be tighter, put together better and has a much higher quality feeling to it. I put over 12K on my last one in over 4 months and never warmed up to it. I can see keeping this one for much longer"
volvo,xc70,2008,Hector Ingram, 02/05/2009,2008 Volvo XC 70 Basic,4,"Purchased new. Basic model with no options.  Very comfortable interior, great seats, clear controls.  Reasonable acceleration, sounds fine, smooth transmission.  Average fuel economy for weight and off road capability.  Well built and feels solid with lots of airbags.  Plenty of space.  Floaty ride, but comfortable and seems reasonable for a cross over."
volvo,xc70,2008,Bob _bear, 05/24/2009,Wow - what a great car,4,"We recently purchased the 2008 XC70 after an exhausted search.  The ride is exceptional and the seat are very comfortable.  We  are averaging 21mpg which we fell is reasonable.  The build quality so far is also exceptional, not a rattle or the slightest defect to be found after two months.  The park assist is excellent giving parking assist on front, back and sides. Radio and speakers are very good. I like the fact that the controls are very clear, easy to locate and only the controls you really need on the steering wheel -- cruise control on one side and radio on the other side.  Overall we are exceptionally happy with our purchase   "
volvo,xc70,2008,Bob Kane, 01/11/2008,2008 XC70,4,"This is a great car and my first Volvo; we traded in our 2004 Acura MDX. After shopping for all the luxury SUVs from Acura to Mercedes, we decide on the Volvo XC70. The XC70 is more cars like and delivers great responsiveness. Safety, build quality and interior appointments are first rate. We have downsized in the past from a Lincoln Navigator to an Acura MDX to the Volvo XC70. This is the perfect size with the most comfortable ride and interior. Acceleration and handling is more than adequate and better than rated by the experts.  "
volvo,xc70,2008,George Fox, 01/19/2008,Excellent family vehicle,4,Excellent safety features. Handles well. Wife feels very good about safety and handling with the children. Good storage space in rear. Auto rear door an excellent feature. Even though the gas mileage is marginal I believe the overall car features offset that and make it an excellent family vehicle. 
volvo,xc70,2008,John Callister, 01/22/2008,Surprisingly Good,4,"It is even better than I expected.  The interior is all of a piece, with those wonderful Volvo seats.  The controls are similar to the last 2002 XC70 we had, rewarding the repeat customer.  There is no flimsy dash mounted cupholder like the old XC70!  The car seats 4 in absolute comfort.  We had a way-back third seat in the old XC70, but not on this one, we almost never used it.   "

volvo,xc70,2008,**no issues here**, 03/07/2010,**No Issues Here**,4,I have been driving this car for about 3 months and so far it has been a great vehicle.  I recently got back into by old car (00 Outback LTD) which my wife now drives and really noticed the comfort and smooth ride of the Volvo!! I live in CO and drive to the mountains nearly weekly.  It does great getting up the passes.  While not excessive the power is adequate to get around people around you. Fuel eco is really not bad if you do a decent amount of highway miles.  If you stick to city only it sure does drop quite a bit.  I am getting between 20-21 combined.  Some issues with a the air blower (makes a clicking noise) but have not yet tried to take it in for a fix.  Overall a great car!!
volvo,xc70,2008,BEST WAGON, 06/02/2010,Two years and still a winner,5,Bought the XC70 in June of 08. Has not had one problem. Only been in for regular maintenance. I drive highway miles to work and average 28 mpg. Would buy the car again. 
volvo,xc70,2008,Cottonwood, 04/04/2008,Great Vehicle!,4,"I love this vehicle! Was a bit hesitant as I moved from a Mercedes E500 and thought I'd miss the HP & luxury but the Volvo has far exceeded expectations. I drive through Colorado about 50K/year and with Blizzak tires, the Volvo is extremely dependable & secure. I will drive 600 miles in one day and finish refreshed & happy.  Averaging 24 MPG on non-premium gas. Certainly not a race car - but you should know that going in.  Two thumbs up.  Only complaint, the key stinks."
volvo,xc70,2008,paw, 04/16/2008,Very Pleased,4,"I bought the XC70 after extentsive research. Having other Volvo's I appreciate the new design: smaller exterior size but larger interior space. Rear leg room is fine as long as the 6-plus footers can compromise a little. Mileage has improved to 23 hywy at 73mph. Performance is great in the high rpm range: paddle shifting works great when passing. We drive to ski county each weekend and frequently encounter snow and slop which the XC handles effortlessly, but I see it could be easy to become overconfident. There is some jerky-ness when initially stepping on the accellerator. For what this car is intended to do, it does very, very well."
volvo,xc70,2008,M3, 02/24/2018,I loved my car until...,4,"I am the second owner and the first one had an accident front passenger side. Car was bought ant rebuilt beautifully. I have had it 6 years and I loved it until the transmission went at 95,929 miles. The problem is that cooling fluid leaked into the trans mission fluid. The glycol has no viscosity and the fluid burned and parts started to crumble. The radiator had to be replaced as well. My fist mechanics diagnosed the problem and offered a rebuilt tranny for $2,700 and a 1 year warranty. He could not say what caused the fluid to overheat. I took it to a dealer who confirmed the burned fluid and  crumbled parts. (It was still shifting but slipping ) the dealer is replacing with new factory parts with lifetime warranty for $6,700. Wow, big hit for what I would say is a bad design. The link between the tranny and cooling system is plastic and not particularly glycol friendly. I plan to keep the car so the lifetime warranty is important and is having both parts of the problem replaced. But yow, the price is awful. Hey Volvo, you charge too much for parts.

volvo,xc70,2008,NIBS, 09/23/2008,2008 Volvo XC70 in Canada,2,"This is my third Volvo. Previous to this car was an 02 XC70 and an 850 turbo. My experience with the 08 model is not something to write home about. The fuel economy of this car (avg 13.8L/100kms) is far less than the 2002 and the increase in HP does little to affect performance.  Personally I prefer the older turbo model.  I also like the center stack from the old model as it was slightly turned towards the driver.  Other than cosmetic, there is very little about this car that is better than the previous model.  The car is not as quiet nor as tight.  I currently have 13K kms on this car and it has been back to the dealer five times for warranty repair.  "
volvo,xc70,2008,antrow, 01/18/2008,Love the car but....,3,"The car only has 1950 miles on it and it was in the shop four times for a clunking/popping sound coming from the front end on turns and some rattles. I think they may have finally fixed it by replacing the front subframe rear bushings and both control arms.  I love the luxurious ride and interior but the gas mileage is only averaging 18 at best and that is with 50-75% highway.  The car has some nice features such as the Blind Spot Warning System, Personal  Car Communicator and remote tailgate.  "
volvo,xc70,2008,an update, 08/27/2010,Update to an earlier review,3,I loved the car. At first. Then it broke. A lot. Eventually even Volvo gave up and gave me my money back after 15 months. I really did like driving the car when I could. But it was a lemon.

volvo,xc70,2008,Schubtone, 10/15/2009,Good enough to buy again,4,"We've had this car for just shy of two years and have always liked it much more than the auto mag reviewers. It fits our family's needs perfectly. It's my wife's daily driver and she appreciates the tank like solidity and the overall sense of quality it exudes. The front seats may be the most comfortable of any car out there, especially for long trips. We make many trips to the ski slopes a year and the AWD makes this Volvo unstoppable. The boxy interior configuration is very efficient, great for hauling all sorts of stuff. A great does it all vehicle. Not particularly sporty or fuel efficient but very luxurious. Thats why were getting another now that our lease is coming to an end."
volvo,xc70,2008,Rawfish, 04/22/2010,Fantastic Volvo,4,"Bought mine new and have had absolutely no issues at all.  As for power, it's a bit weak and my 2001 XC70 with the turbo was much faster, but all in all it's enough.  Super safe...that is the main reason I got it. No ONE beats Volvo on that so I'll trade speed (I also had a S60R) for safety."
volvo,xc70,2008,jeffmay27, 11/01/2011,My Last Volvo - Disapointing,2,"I have owned three Volvo's in the last 10 years, always leased them for 4 years and got another one.
This was my second XC70.
This 2008 XC70 has been horrible, the day I got it one of the radiators sprung a leak and I Was forced to get it serviced on a Satruday.
the sales rep did nto include an owners manual or the Volvo hotline.
Since then the floating panel had to be replaced, the windows do nto go up and down properly.
I took the car in at 82,000Km to get last warranty work done (I was late by 2K) and was told the rules - has to be under 80,000KM.
I guess a 10 year history with a Company does not warrant any reverse loyalty.
MY last Volvo - I will be glad when my lease is up Jul12."
volvo,xc70,2008,DaveJ, 11/15/2009,Big Disapointment,3,Acquired on 2 yr 12K Volvo lease with promise that I could extend for 6 months. Now that I am at lease end Volvo and the dealer will not honor the original promise. I was offered a $29K buyout do not overpay. I am through with Volvo. I had a 2000 V70XC-SE. After 90K miles major systems failed and cost to keep it on the road were VERY high. Same experience with a prior 240 DL.  You cannot afford to keep them going once they need major service. The 2008 has disappointing performance and mileage. It is underpowered. The BLIS sensors and ultrasonic sensors don't work in the rain or snow.  Any load in the rear causes the springs to bottom out. Check Xenon headlight replacement cost. 
volvo,xc70,2008,Phil Labelle, 12/20/2007,A brand new XC 70,3,"I got the car last week.  Since then, it has snowed almost everyday.  The car handles well in the snow and is very well balanced.  So far so good!  I will update this review later."
volvo,xc70,2008,luisja, 03/04/2008,Pretty decent car,3,"I've owned this car for almost 3  months. It has some features that I love like, the PCC, BLIS and some other gadgets. The mileage is pretty bad, they really need to do something about it or bring the diesel model. Even you get better mileage with the BMW 5 series. The performance is just OK, at high RPM makes too much noise and the car reacts kind of slow when you press the gas, once you are cruising on the highway everything goes smooth and it handles pretty well."
volvo,xc70,2008,Evelyn Temple-Giebel, 09/01/2017,A fine car,5,"I have had the car for nine years . Admittedly the mileage is low, but it is like a new 🚗 car. I had some trouble s few years back with the motherboard, which was replaced. Unfortunately, even though the car had very low mileage I had owned it for more than 5 years so it was out of warranty . Love ❤️ my Volvo XC 70!

volvo,xc70,2008,Kevin, 08/16/2008,Mix Bag of Unknowns,2,"We bought this in April and I am very sensitive to transmission quirks . It hunts incessantly from gear to gear indecisively making me a bit uncomfortable.  I never felt confident and the mpg is not near the perf we should get. . I kept getting the runaround from the dealer saying its an ""adaptive"" trans. and would smooth out after break in , but I know cars and was upset 4 months later- gas mileage under 20  I finally snapped  sold it on craigslist saying we were moving . Yeah moving from one car to another . The Volvo was true to its FORD bones-poor-power to weight.  We got an Audi A4 - Like night and day- some sap got the VOLVO- Volvos now I know what all the hupla is about- nothing! "
volvo,xc70,2008,FirstLast, 02/03/2009,Love it!,4,"I am so happy I bought this car.  It handles beautifully in the snow and is very comfortable.  The only negative I have found is the sun visors.  They are not wide enough.  The gap between the visor and the pillar is enough to cause a blinding glare.  When they are straight down, they obscure the road.  Other than that, everything is perfect.   "
volvo,xc70,2008,rwhome, 12/29/2007,New Family Addition,4,"Ever since giving up on the Chrysler because of its poor performance and gas guzzling tendencies, this vehicle provides the ideal alternative.  Better cachet and a much more maneuverable package, the Volvo matches or exceeds all the Pacifica benefits, then goes further with laser enhanced cruise control, satellite stereo, built-in child seats, and a really effective bluetooth system. still, I wish it were more economical."
volvo,xc70,2008,BrettW, 11/04/2009,Overall Excellent,4,"Overall, this vehicle has been excellent. I purchased it with 10,000 miles on it and have added another 12,000 in the past 9 months. The car handles snow like a champ- in fact much better than the touted Subaru all wheel drive system (I traded in a 2007 Legacy for this car). It is slightly underpowered off the line, but at 55 miles per hour and above this car has plenty of torque to pass on tough Colorado mountain passes.  The interior design and quality is excellent, and the seats are everything you expect from a Volvo. They wholeheartedly live up to their expectation.  Only issues have been a few rattles and squeaks and a defective speaker that the dealer solved."
volvo,xc70,2008,Wagon man, 12/05/2017,Wagon man,4,"This unit replaced a 2005 XC70, which I managed to total. The differences between the older models and the 08 are big. Comfort, ride, interior are all superior. What's not: fuel economy and sprite of the older model. Blame the weight and the engine. I'm sure the T6 models are much more spry.  The trade off is the superior ride and feel of the car. Negatives: gas mileage, slower handling. This thing is a tank. One thing I miss from the older model are the heated front seats. If you have the option, get them. 
Since posting this, I replaced the rear brakes at 85,000 miles and the front brakes at 94,000. No other major issues other than a cracked engine mount and a faulty fuel sensor (the latter a $800 fix at the dealership). My next Volvo will either be the 2016 xc70 or the V90 wagon.

volvo,xc70,2009,Thom Walsh, 09/06/2010,Great Wagon,4,"As a satisfied owner of  a '99 XC70 I purchased the '09 because of all the incentives.  What a great wagon!  Fast, comfortable, spacious and fun to drive.  A big improvement over the ""99.  The  3.0 Turbo is a blast and the transmission is a seamless partner.  Handling is  considerably  better than any SUV  I tested. Considering the weight of this wagon and the horsepower, the gas mileage is fantastic (21mpg). "
volvo,xc70,2009,lahavespecial, 07/09/2009,"Couldn't be better, very solid car",4,"We test drove an XC90R and the XC70 T6, the T6 was buttery smooth, faster, and more refined. Completely outclassed the XC90. Initially the auto trans. was jerky at times and sometimes shifted sluggishly, but after 3 months, we didn't notice it at all, completely smooth. Mileage in the beginning averaged close to 13L/100km, but now is close to 10.5, after 17,000 Km's, and getting better. This is a very solidly built car, tough, comfortable, builds confidence.I can stand up after 9 hrs driving and feel no back pain! Great winter car, with full winter tires, confidently passed many lines of tailgaters on snow covered highway. Reliable, not one issue to date! AWD engages effortlessly, Ex. in snow"
volvo,xc70,2009,A.R., 02/21/2010,Solid Choice,4,"We bought the XC70 T6 to replace a Passat wagon that was totalled in a car crash- both kids inside. Not as sporty and fun as the Passat, but all of the practical features surpass it easily. The higher ground clearance is great for our winter climate, the AWD is reassuring and the T6 is great for hwy accelerations. As a family with two small kids, the cargo space is excellent and getting kids in/out is easier than in the lower Passat. Fuel economy could be better, but my kids' safety is worth it, especially after our accident. Great interior space for tall/ leggy people too."

volvo,xc70,2009,Michael, 05/13/2009,A surprise,4,"We already own a 2002 XC70.  We decided to get another car and the wife decided she was only getting another XC.  The 2002 has been the least hassle car we have owned.  We have had a Chevy die in a toll booth, chryslers with ABS computer problems, Jags with various quirks.  The only problem with the 02 was a stuck filler door fixed under warranty.  I was leery of the reported fuel mileage and can state that to get to 18mpg one has to be going 87 mph.  This was the surprise.  Normal cruise at 72 mph yielded 25.4 mpg.  By the way the T6 goes like stink.  The wife is already looking for Mustangs to put the hurt on. I'll be adding further reviews as the mileage adds up. 400 miles so far."

volvo,xc70,2009,luis, 02/25/2009,Stay away,3,"I've owned this car for 14 months and I can't wait for my lease to be up. Wait a couple years before Volvo puts everything together in this car. Every week there is one thing, electronic issues, alert messages, ratles, transmission jumps from one gear to another for no reason and in the mountains the car goes nuts. The dealer says it is normal in this model and Volvo is still trying to improve it. Resale value is horrible, reliability is even worse, check for yourself Consumer reports and see the ratings from the editors at Edmunds. Do not make the same mistake and wait until they do something about it, it is hard to believe that from the past model Volvo has done such a bad job."

I have previously owned a 1999 (which had problems) and a 2001 XC70 which I picked up in Sweden on Volvo's Tourist program.    Contrary to the other review here, I am delighted with my new XC70. It is a solid comfortable ride. I did change the tires from the Continentals it came with to Bridgestones. It's a great addition to the lineup.. I do wish it had the Four C suspension. I got misled by the dealer about that."

Also I really love the fact that Volvos are a class by themselves - not the common snob badge that is Mercedes and BMW that people buy to satisfy their egos and that every Tom, Dick and Harry has.  Good car all around - and this is from someone who actually owes it."
volvo,xc70,2009,Pete in Golden, 09/09/2009,Nice hauler and 21 mpg!,4,"We bought a demo T6 (4600 miles) to replace our well-used '98 XC (145,000 mi).  After shopping the Audi A6, BMW 530xi and Passat 4Motion, we came back to the Volvo due to its edge on cargo size (and utility) and our previous experience with the XC in the snow.  We drive the Colo. mountains every weekend in the winter and the Volvo (with snows) is impossible to beat: goes where you point it and stops when you want it to -- inspires a great deal of confidence in bad conditions.  The reviews I read about the car's mileage gave me pause, but I'm happy to report that we're getting 21 mpg in mixed driving (with a cargo pod always on the roof).  (Same mpg more or less as the smaller 98 XC)"

The perfect car for those not concerned with badge flashing (bmw, merc, etc)...A very understated luxurious ride...This car is literally an S80 inside...Same car with a cargo area...  Can't say enough about how impressed I am with the quality of the ride and fit and finish.  Fuel economy could be better but I knew this going in....  Sounds like a vault when closing the doors.  Read comments about sloppy handling by some.  Not the case with the adaptive suspension.  I added 19 inch Volvo Erakir wheels as well so I'm sure this improved handling too...  Avoid the base 3.2 engine like the plague.  Anemic compared to T6, which is very refined."

And smooth on acceleration. Fuel economy is just so-so, but offset by the Safe + Secure package that comes standard (free maintenance and wear-and-tear for five years). So far (3,000 miles), so good. By the way, we gifted our 2002 XC70 to our son who lives in the mountains of Wyoming. It's just getting started at 100,000 miles."

Volvo has changed and I'd love to talk to their CEO and tell him about the fall from grace.  The new 6cyl. engine sounds like a vacuum cleaner and is too loud at cruising.  Great seating.  The transmission jumps when you are at idle.  Several trips to the dealer for software upgrades; the Volvo tech also had it jump forward without applying the gas.  My wife has an 08, five cyl. and is much quieter.  Gas mileage is terrible- only 21 avg. on highway.  This is not the Volvo of the past."

Overall very happy with the car, smooth drive, lots of space, good safety features, clean and simple interior design, very comfortable seats and excellent visibility. Handles very well. My only criticism is the less than impressive fuel economy. Base engine is also a little sluggish at the lower end. Seems to perform much better when higher octane fuel is used. Solid family car."
volvo,xc70,2010,Ben Makowski, 04/09/2010,Almost did not happen,4,"We were looking for a weekend hauler for our Golden Retrievers and were all set to pick up a new Outback.  Over the weekend waiting for the Subaru to arrive for delivery I was on line and saw the XC70  and then saw the amazing deals on this amazing wagon.  Monday morning first thing went to Capital Volvo and told them about the Subaru and then asked them to show me why I should change my mind and all I had to do was simply drive this car, no comparison at all the subaru, it excelled in every aspect.  It is more ""premium' feeling and so far we have had only 2 weeks but are very happy of our purchase.  Me and my ""significant other"" both drive new MB's but we argue who gets to drive the Volvo."
volvo,xc70,2010,Bill Stevenson, 04/16/2010,Workhorse Wagon,4,"Volvo understands the needs of station wagon buyers.  This is not a sports car, it is a workhorse.  It pulls my trailer with no problem.  It is easy to fold down the rear seat and haul a lot of stuff.  Example, my long wheelbase recumbent bicycle slides in easily with only the front wheel needing to be removed.  There are adjustable tie down points for securing a load in the back, a nice detail.  The controls are intuitive and everything is within reach and easy to use. The ride is quiet and the car is sure footed in bad weather. Attention to detail is excellent. Everything works, switches and controls have a nice tactile feel. A surprisingly nice car everyone who has experienced it agrees."

That's one heck of a distance from the 43,000 it stickered for 2 years ago. Car is tight, room for my stuff, quite , has all the power I need and with no turbo takes regular fuel. I can go over 400 mile per tankful . I would have bought an Outback new at 32 grand, but this Volvo is more car. However keep in mind it takes one heck of a hit in its first 2 years.

Since I do a lot of winter/mountain driving this made sense and roads I would have never made it up without chains, this car handeled like the roads were dry.  Only two minor suggestions.  The instrument panel doesn't show engine temp and the drivers side windshield wiper won't clear the hood and stay up when I want to clean the glass.  Maybe in the 2011 model they can fix this.

The mpg was a pleasant surprise considering the EPA rating (22 mpg hwy) and some of the reviews.
Effortless cruising at 200 kph on the Autobahn. Overall, almost as impressive as my BMW 335i E92 but they're much different beasts. "

It is absolutely worth the extra $ for the turbo version.
I traded in my 2008 and a 2008 BMW M3 on this Volvo and I don't miss the BMW at all because the new Volvo is so much fun to drive.
The best of both worlds.
Way to go, Volvo!"
volvo,xc70,2011,abmwfan, 12/19/2010,Consider the T6 if you're looking for an XC70,4,"I traded a 2009 XC70 3.2 AWD for a 2011 XC70 T6. The turbo engine significantly improves this vehicle: quieter, smoother, more than adequate acceleration and no noticeable reduction in mpg. The 3.2 is slow, buzzy/noisy and it gets lousy mpg (worst of all worlds).
You're always aware of the engine working at the limits of its capacity to move this heavy vehicle. And, while the T6's base price is $6k higher, it comes standard with AWD and premium/leather package which are nearly always added to the 3.2, so the ""base"" sticker price of the T6 and 3.2 are essentially the same before other options. Why not get the bigger engine?"

I wanted a car that was fun to drive, yet able to carry me, my friends and camping gear up Idaho forrest roads.

It is very fun to drive.
I love the comfortable seat and the relatively quiet AWD.
The handling was excellent and the turbo had loads of pickup.

volvo,xc70,2011,jjf5, 12/22/2010,A beautiful wagon,4,"We had wanted to buy one of these for over a year, and I had done extensive research.
I initially wanted a V70, but wife wanted the AWD.
I thought the base XC70 3.2 was too slow and inefficient, and wanted to see what happened after Ford sold Volvo to the Chinese.
I'm glad I waited.
Not only were prices slashed, but quality and features improved.
I picked up an XC70 T6 cheaper than last year's base model.
Volvo hired a good CEO, and the workers in Gothenburg are happier than they were under Ford.
This combined with it being the 3rd production year should mean improved reliability, but we'll see.
I'll post a long term update after 10000 miles."
volvo,xc70,2011,an0nym0us, 08/10/2011,"Looks good, feels great, but...",4,"Comparing to 2002 V70XC I traded in for it, it's a mixed bag.
Interior feels much more luxurious and refined; also appears somewhat roomier.
Exterior design mostly improved on the previous generation, except for those silvery things around fog lights.
Actually on mine - painted Electric Silver - they look OK, but on darker cars they're outright out of place.
The engine - 3.2 inline 6 - is nominally more powerful than the T5 on previous generation, but feels not as peppy as the older one.
Gas mileage is not as good, too.
The transmission feels more smooth-shifting and refined.
The suspension is tuned more towards ride comfort rather than spirited driving style."
volvo,xc70,2011,Robert Zamenhof, 02/29/2016,Why I just purchased a second 2011 XC70 T6,5,"Overall this is a pretty good car. Having had only Volvo wagons since 1980, I have to say that this 2011 seems more solid and heavy (in a good way) than any of my previous models or later models I have driven as loaners. Generally reliability has been good--with a few 

exceptions: At 85,000 miles, the engine started to use a lot of oil. Volvo examined it and replaced the entire engine. They told me that it was a bad batch of piston rings that was responsible, so this wasn't really a ""bad"" feature of the car. Volvo has never been able to properly balance the wheels, so I have learned to live with a slight steering wheel vibration at around 60 mph. They said the rims were distorted and sent them for repair; but that didn't help. Tire Rack replaced all 4 tires TWICE, with no improvement. The design of the rims is such that mud stays put and makes the balance problem markedly worse. I have never been totally happy with the brakes, but a recent full brake replacement has fixed this problem. There is a really stupid feature of the software: when the fog lights are on, they go out when high beams are selected, but don't come back on when you return to low beams. Interestingly, the second identical model I just purchased doesn't do this! Finally, I am singularly unimpressed with the headlights, specially the high beams. I've replaced the low-beam bulbs with high intensity ""silver tip"" bulbs, but see hardly any difference. There are no high intensity replacements for the high-beam bulbs, so when I drive at night plplllI envy the bright headlights of much cheaper cars.

LlLL2nd Review 9/1/16:
L having now owned my 2nd 2011 XC70 T6 for about 6 months, I can add a little to this review. The 2nd XC70 seems just as well built as my first one. I do, however, miss the folding rear-view mirrors and the front seats don'r seem to be quite as comfortable; but since the car has less than 30,000 miles, it could just be a break-in phenomenon. The headlights are markedly superior to those on the first car (see above review), even with standard bulbs, and there are no problems with wheel balance or braking (see above review). The silly fog-light phenomenon I described for the first car is also absent.  In summary, the 2nd car is just as good as the first, and just as robust and ""heavy"" in a good way. I'd like to replace the first car with another 2011 (it has 130,000 miles); but I don't think I could find a low-mileage 2011 again.

Since the first review (see above), the first car has had the following major repairs (all covered by an extended warranty policy): New A/C compressor, new motor for driver's side mirror (motor failed).

I am getting 21+ miles in suburban driving, the seats are very supportive and comfortable. I haul two boats and have had no problems with the ability to pull them. We use the more than ample space behind the front row seats to haul all our stuff home back from our summer place. The Bliss system works as promised but does do false readings in the rain. We have the ccomvenirnce group and climate group of add ons plus the personal communications feature and all work as promised. I find the control panel easy to use and the Bluetooth set up is easy to use. "
volvo,xc70,2011,jrod1790, 10/05/2010,The Real Swagger Wagon,4,"I can't say enough good things about this car.  Its fun to drive and has the most comfortable seats I've ever been in.  I wasn't in love with the idea of getting a wagon/crossover but with an expanding family it was necessary. However, once I drove the car with the T6 engine all my apprehension went away.  It really makes the car fun to drive as there is power on demand at all rev ranges!  I test drove the 3.2 twice and the difference in performance was significant.   Also like all Volvos, the XC70 is loaded with safety, convenience, and technology.  I've driven about 1000 miles so far, close to 50/50 local and highway, and I'm averaging a touch over 22 MPG on 91 Octane."

So I had it replaced, mechanic said it was not glued in properly and he could move it back and forth with his hand. How's that for quality? 

These cars are crap.  Maintenance costs are a little pricey but you have to expect to maintain any car.  But when things break that are never supposed to break for over 100K mi and 10 years, that is not OK.  

In 55 yrs and lots of cars I have never had to replace a coil spring or a seat belt re tractor; that's just insane and it's safety related.  And how about the DTSC?  Stopping the car dead in an intersection and not moving even when I pressed the accelerator to the floor-yes engine was running but did not rev- computer probably prevented engine power. 

I have owned cars that I ran for over 230K mi and never had stuff like this break. 

update:  I saw that the rear coil spring was not a strut type yet, they wanted 1 1/2 hours labor and they wanted to replace both plus alignment. A simple trailing arm suspension with separate tube shock, once unbolted allows the spring to be removed by hand.  The ""top hat"" to the coil spring was rusty which I find unacceptable for a supposedly premium car with such low miles.  The quality is missing.  Don't buy a Volvo. I bought the spring (had to wait 7 days for it to be shipped)  and put it in myself in about 45 min. once I had the car jacked on stands.  See You tube for demo of someone doing this. 

By the way, I consider the RAD sensor to be part of the smog equipment.  This is supposed to be warrenteed for 10 years by law but they wouldn't cover it."

I got it just in time, as Portland winter came and we were blanketed in snow and ice 4 times over 2 months.  I put studded tires on the car and it has been a tank!  Not one single slip or skid...even starting on a steep incline.  The acceleration is amazing.  This car flat out moves, which is pretty impressive considering it is not a light vehicle.  The seats are amazingly comfortable!  You can actually feel the seat cushion bounce a little as you go over bumps rather than your body absorbing the shock.  We had reservations of purchasing a used Volvo over a new Subaru, but after driving both...the decision was easy.  Hoping this girl keeps truckin' for many more years!

We have owned this car for 4 years now and still love it. My sixteen year old has chosen this car to drive over our other car, a BMW 335i.

Feels like it's build like a frickin' tank, as I'm sure it is. Turbo engine does well. Not what you'd call nimble for around-town driving, but fantastic seats and big-car driving dynamics make it an awesome road-trip car. Excellent stereo.

Car looks classy, inside and out. 

We owned an SUV in the past -- and hated it. Hated the high, tippy feel, tight squeeze in parking spaces, bad mileage. The Volvo solved all that. We recently bought a 2014 Highlander for 7-seater carpool purposes, and while it's nice enough it's not as all-around great as the Volvo. Toyota's only advantage: 2 more seats."

The Volvo is very practical, with the best front seats I've ever sat in. Decent power with the 300horse T6. I have the Platinum trim level with every option. I have 34,500 miles on the car now, never in the shop except for oil changes. I love the big car driving feel, I hate little cars so I feel like this was a very good choice for me. The deal breaker on the Eclass Mercedes is that the seat cushion doesn't adjust in the tilt, in other words it stays flat and I could never get comfortable in my 2013 E550.
  Updated after 15 months of ownership. I added IPD rear away bar, quad tip mufflers and replaced the factory wheels with lighter alloys with Dunlop Direzzas. Car handles much better, next upgrade will be Polestar flash tune.

I am less tired after a long freeway trip than in previous cars I have had, because of the excellent driving position, superior visibility, great road-holding feel (it feels like it drives itself when going 75 MPH), slightly heavy steering feel (which requires less effort during high-speed driving),  wonderful seats, blind-spot monitoring system, and a superior audio sound system. The cabin is also quiet, and AC is powerful. Nothing has broken, in spite of the car's electronic complexity, and the interior still looks very good because of the high quality of the materials. This model has been overlooked by most people, and is now discontinued, but I believe I've owned a gem.

volvo,xc70,2014,xira1, 01/10/2015,Three years later,5,"Here's what I said after one year: ""I now have been driving my XC70 for one year and 15,000 miles.  My impression, after looking at some other comparable cars, is that it remains a wonderful value in terms of interior quality.  Even the $50,000 Acura MDX doesn't have as nice an interior. Every component is top-notch. It's great for a long trip because of the comfort and the FABULOUS sound system. Where it disappoints is in driving dynamics; it's not really fun to drive; it's safe and predictable and road-holding but not exciting.""

Now that over 3 years and 43,000 miles have gone by, I have the same opinion.  I think this is a very under-recognized car. It is top-notch quality in all the materials. Nothing significant has gone wrong with the car (the battery wore out a bit early because too many components can be running on it when the engine is off). We love it for long trips and for its super-secure handling.  I also enjoy it for its lower-than-SUV lift-height (that makes it easier to get bikes inside and our kayaks on the roof; its also easier for our dogs to jump inside). I would definitely buy it again.

In fact, I shopped around A LOT before replacing my 2011 S60 T6 AWD with the 2015 XC70 T6 AWD. I'm not a fan of SUV looking vehicles but I require good rear leg room and ample cargo capacity. I also prefer more ground clearance than sedans+ as pot holes and high/steep curves have ruined my day in lower sitting cars. The wagon body-style is more popular in Europe and that suites me just fine.

volvo,xc70,2015,Andrian Kouznetsov, 03/17/2015,Volvo has customer service issues,4,"This is my fifth Volvo and the last one. 
I leased new XC70 2015 T6 AWD in and I have 15k miles on it. It is great car to some extend regardless of the price tag. It has unique combination of performance, luxury and utility and is well built. So what's the problem?

Soon after I leased the car local dealership was closed and I learned that according to ""Volvo's policies"" I have to drive 200 miles distance to the next dealership to get scheduled maintenance. Is this reasonable? I tried working though Volvo customer service, but have been politely stonewalled, the company has no method of filing customer complaints. They all come back to the same person. 

March 2016 update
The car behaves perfectly, after putting 20k miles on it, I like it more than right after the purchase. No mechanical issues or any issues. This car is really well built even comparing to previous Volvos that I had., Mileage 19 mpg in mixed city/freeway driving using premium gasoline. I changed oil three times and did tires balancing at about 17k miles.  Further impressions - this is not performance ""drivers car"".  But it got enough power to leave many ""drivers cars"" behind.  You just use this power not for driving fun but for driving comfort. That's probably a good definition for this car - very comfortable. I decided to keep the car for a bit longer and bought out the lease. 

As for Volvo fixing customer service issues - there is no visible progress, they dropped all their customers after closing some dealerships.

March 2017 update
The car still is as good as new and I am liking it more with every month passing by. Still getting between 19 to 20 mpg and it is about 25k miles now. There is Volvo recall to upgrade the software for AWD system. Well  now I do nave to drive 200 miles to closes dealership.

I am surprised when auto reviewers say the engines are not adequate-I have to wonder why someone would buy and drive a station wagon like you would a performance sport car.

volvo,xc70,2015,Mitch Johns, 09/24/2015,My first impressions after 700 miles,4,"We purchased an XC 70 platinum T6 3 liter that had an EPA mpg at 17/24 mpg. We chose this car after purchasing two BMW X1s in 2014 and 2015. I was a bit worried about the mpg and that I would be consuming more gas and hurting the environment. Well after our first major road trip of 430 miles in CA from N. Ca, through Sacramento to Palo Alto, I was impressed. You have to know that this road trip is primarily major state and federal highways, on roads that are very bumpy, can be stressful, and very heavy with traffic. We obtained an overall round-trip gas mileage of 25.6 mpg with cruising speeds of 70-80 mph, and considerable stop and go on these interstates. Frankly consider this route to be one of the worst traveling itinerary  that you could ever drive and put a car through. 
The best attribute of this car is the Volvo front car seats that are likely the most comfortable in a car. We purchased the car mostly for the front car seats as my wife has spinal issues that causes her great pain and discomfort about the third hour of a road trip. The seat comfort was the best of what could be expected given my wife's chronic aliments. I cannot say this for the back car seats as they are average, and the designers could have engineered more leg room for the rear passengers. Don't get the wrong impression, it is still better than the X1s that we have experienced.
The auto runs smooth, plenty of acceleration, low road noise, and takes the highway bumps with little lingering memory. What I might be critical of is the steering as it is a bit light and you don't have intuitive feeling you get out of a performance car such as a BMW X1. The handling around curves is slightly above average, but you should slow down a bit if it is a tight curve as there is a slight body lean and response for you to take it more slower than a performance car.
I have only 700 miles on the car and as you know, nothing is broken in yet, the engine especially. I will look forward to more (pleasurable) road trips and I anticipate that I will find the car much more superior and also expect to obtain slightly higher mpg on long road trips. There are no available safety ratings for this model, but it is a Volvo. The exterior body is very solid and the finish is excellent. We have learned much after purchasing three new cars in the last 24 months and anyone purchasing should do their homework in regards to invoice price, reviews of the car handling, etc.

Family tow stuff with it, Scotland Yard police use it as police car, you name it. It’s just a beast. The ride is a bit like a boat, at low speed, but, at highway, it feels firm & goes over potholes with good isolation. Front & rear sensor helps a lot. Steering is not light but not heavy, it has a smooth, rubbery feel but definitely like like a F250 loose. In other words, long distance driving it’s not tiring. Acceleration is amazing at high way. Comfy seat no issues. Infotainment & voice control are reliable to use once you learn it. Mine has 29000 miles, there’s a bit of rear seat area squeaking but I’m yet to investigate why, could be just natural built quality. Note that my previous 2017 V60 CC feels tighter in built quality. Two gripes about Volvo Bluetooth, when using iPhones to make call, the voice vol of the other person is so low that it’s practically useless.

It is my third Volvo, currently has 20,000 miles. No problems. Lots of room for hauling. I like the XC70 because the rear seats fold flat, so you have over 5 feet length of flat area. I hauled a Stickley collector bookshelf over 1200 miles, for example. Also great for hauling dogs, and their crates. In my opinion this is the best road trip car -- ever. Super fast and hugs the road. Rain and snow are no problem for this gem. Traded in my 2009 S60 with 55,000 miles. I still miss that car, never a problem. My 2000 S70 sold to mom and dad, has over 120,000 miles, no problems. My experience with Volvo has been outstanding. The service from Volvo dealers has also been more than excellent. Sadly, I traded in my Volvo XC70 for a Porsche Macan S, that I like very much, partly because it is rear wheel drive based. I miss my Volvo, and think about her often.  If I had had more money, and a bigger garage, I would not have let her go. Somebody got an amazing car!

I have tire insecurity and no matter how well everything else works not knowing when your tires will get a flat or wear out so quickly, makes me feel unsafe, insecure about driving it, especially any road trips I take, which I do a lot living in New England.  Three out of the four tires got flats, one day when I was picking up my dad in another state, I went to replace the tire and they couldn't get it for 3 days, we had nowhere to stay and my Dad was very ill.  At that time there was only one tire you could use to replace it.  Luckily the garage next door plugged it but I drove 2 1/2 hours back home white knuckled with my elderly father.  It was nerve-racking.  Got two more flats, all different tires.  So starting with the four original tires, plus three, thats seven tire in less than 4 years and just was told I needed to replace all 4 tires this winter, that 11 tires in 4 years...so now instead of dealing with the lack of concern and attention to a customer's obvious issues with tires, alignment I'm trading in this car for one I feel confident and safe traveling at night, on a highway or back country roads.  Update: got rid of it and got an Audi Q7 in January 2019

volvo,xc70,2015,Colette, 02/28/2018,LOVE this car,5,"This is my 5th Volvo Wagon.  Upgraded from my 20-yr.old/260K V70 after the turbo seized.  This car is lovely.  Luxurious.  Zippy.  Beautiful.  Comfortable.  Plenty of leg room for my 6'2"" husband.  Seats are awesome (We don't use the back seat, however.  No kids.  But, the leather is beautiful, and more ports, etc., back there than one can imagine requiring.)  Didn't rate maintenance cost/reliability as I've only had it about 6 weeks, thus no experience with those issues.  Certainly seems solid and runs like a champ.  Bought the extended warranty, as am sure it is expensive to work on, based on past experience, if one wants to use Volvo parts.   Hoping it lasts another 20 years.  :-)  Due to the extensive safety features, full insurance coverage on this car was less than on the V70.  My mileage estimate figure isn't accurate, as I don't track that, but the form won't let me leave it blank.  Go with the mfg. specs, I guess, or find a review from someone who tracks that.  Seems fine to me.

volvo,xc70,2015,Trophoblaster, 12/29/2019,After 75000 miles in an T6 AWD,5,"Our 2015 XC70 T6 has been a delight. Great acceleration when needed.  Ample storage space.  Traveling in the winter has been reassuring with sure footing of all wheel drive.  The ride is superb with the legendary Volvo seats.  My wife's 95 year old mother can slide right into the back seat.   Servicing has been outstanding at Best Motors (ask for Dave).  However, this vehicle has not required anything but the routine maintenance and tires at 75,000 miles.  Anticipate keeping our Volvo in our stable for many years to come along side our 2003 Volvo V70.

volvo,xc70,2015,Mommy Nguyen, 01/27/2020,Great wagon!!,5,"Love the solid construction of the wagon, very manageable, and has all the bells and whistles of safety and comfort. I bought it for myself, but my daughter loves it so much so I gave it to her. Bluetooth of the wagon is so strong that it picks up signals even when the phone is in the house. It has blind spot sensor and backup camera which are very useful and provide added safety for new drivers!! Thanks Volvo for making such a great car!!

volvo,xc70,2015,ChipF, 10/14/2020,Great Volvo!,5,"The 2015 XC70 is a great car.  The T6 engine is powerful and car handles beautifully.  The interior has a European luxury feel with easy to use technology.  One of the best things in the XC70 is the seats.  Volvo is know for incredibly comfortable seats and of the 3 Volvo's we've had over time these are the best and the most comfortable seats of any car we've driven.  One of the big advantages of the station wagon platform over an SUV is lower height.  Our family is very active out door activities with Kayaks, bikes and skis and the XC 70 makes it much easier to get stuff on and off the roof racks because it isn't so high.  The XC70 also has a lot more interior cargo space compared to other wagons and SUV's.  The challenge is that Volvo discontinued the XC70 in 2016 so its increasing difficult to find lower mileage inventory.  They are really popular and don't stay on dealer lots long.  My wife and I have a 2012 and decided to get a second XC 70  while still can and missed three of them at different dealers as they only lasted a day or two for sale.  If you want to but a great, luxurious, sport wagon/SUV, the 2015 XC70 is a great choice!

volvo,xc70,2016,DRS, 01/29/2016,"""I now take the LONG way everywhere I go!""",5,"For my 40th birthday, my wife surprised me with a trip to the Volvo dealership. You see, a couple of years ago I had to bite the bullet and trade in my 08 XC90 for a Chrysler Town and Country minivan because of the kids. As minivans go, it's great, but... it's a minivan. So for my 40th, my wife said that we could trade in her '15 Subaru Forester for the new XC90! I test drove the 90 and it was great - really nice, but just a little too fancy. See, I'm an avid fly fisherman and I was having trouble picturing this very fancy SUV with muddy boots and waders in the back and mud all over the sides. Besides, I think the new '90 lost a lot of its ""Volvoness"". The XC70 on the other hand - beautiful classic Volvo. Just as comfortable on the side of a river as it is going out to dinner and a show in the city. So I test drove it and fell in love. The whole experience made it feel like the car was made for me. So we traded in the Forester, which I never quite fit into comfortably (I'm 6', 280lbs, but I carry it well ;) ), and leased the XC70. I picked up the car on New Year's Eve, 2015 and have been loving every bit of it for about a month now. The built in booster seats are awesome for the kids, the fold down passenger seat means I don't have to break down my fly rods to get them in the car, the iPhone app is ridiculously useful, I drove it in the Blizzard of '16 and it handled it like the ""blizzard"" of '15, I was a little worried about the lack of touch screen but having gotten used to the controls on the steering wheel I found them to be so much easier - especially with the rhino hooves that I have for hands! Every time - Every single time - I get into it, I smile. I smile, and I take the long way everywhere I go. Hey, with these gas prices, what's stoppin' me?

volvo,xc70,2016,MMS, 08/29/2016,Reunited,5,"Sold my 2004 xc70 5 years and two cars ago with 150,000 miles on it.  Missed it from day one.  When I heard this was the last year for the model I had to get one.  Best car ever.  Solid ride, excellent performance with the 5 cylinder engine.   The best all around car on the road.  The Golden Retriever of the car industry.

volvo,xc70,2016,John Sibilia, 01/20/2016,My new volvo XC70,4,"Picked up the volvo about three weeks ago after driving a BMW530 for twelve years.  Decided to lease the car in case I missed the sporty feel of a sedan.  However, after a few weeks I really like the convenience of the wagon, more room for the dog, golf clubs and hitch on the back for the bikes.  Electronics are simple and intuitive.  I really like the wifi hot spot feature in this 2016 model.  Comfort is excellent compared to the beamer.  The only thing I don't like is the low gas mileage but I knew this would be the trade-off with the four wheel drive.  With gas prices low and living in NJ, I was willing to give up gas efficiency to feel safer especially when it snows.  So far, I'm very happy with this car.

volvo,xc70,2016,Robin Kirk, 12/29/2015,A Super Solid Choice,5,"My Audi A8 just turned  4 years old and 60k miles and I was looking for a comfortable, practical SUV/Wagon replacement that didn't cost as much.
I drove the Q5 and Allroad, the BMW X3 and X5, and the V60, XC60 and XC70. Although an older design, the XC70 was just more comfortable, more practical and less flashy. It is powerful, quiet, extremely comfortable and handles reasonably well. The technology package is state-of-the-art and the IPhone App is just great.
With just under 1000 miles in the past month, I am quite delighted.
I was worried that ""trading down"" from the A8 would be painful, but am really quite pleased.
The fuel economy isn't too good, but with current gas prices, it doesn't hurt too much.
I would strongly recommend this car.

volvo,xc70,2016,JimT, 11/09/2016,Don't Let This One Get Away,5,"Volvo has sold a wagon with a vertical liftgate since 1953.  This is the last, don't let it get away.  My 5th Volvo and the best yet.  7K miles on it so far.  For a huge wagon, the steering is responsive with good feedback.  Breaks are awesome.  They have finally eliminated the torque steer, totally, which was present on my 1998 V70XC and worse on my 2007 XC70.  the 2007 had terrible wet braking, the 2016 has great wet road brakes.  Very quiet, very comfortable, good electronics.  Better than 27mpg in mostly highway driving.  Next year's 2017 cross country costs 18 thousand dollars more and may not be as good.  The 2017 has a hatchback, cutting cargo room, and a 4cyl engine which may not be as smooth, at least, not yet.  This 2016 has the tried and true 5 banger.  The only downside is that the 6 speed auto is a little reluctant to downshift, you have to mash the throttle a little or shift manually.  Oh, and the active safety already prevented a collision for me, accelerating onto a highway, checking the left mirror, did not notice the stopped traffic ahead until the Volvo applied the brakes for me.   Thanks, Volvo.

volvo,xc70,2016,AnnetteW, 08/06/2016,Beautiful new XC70,5,"Love my new Volvo XC - after driving my 2001 V40 with over 172,000!  Before buying also considered a Subaru Forester and Subaru Crosstrek.  What sold me on the Volvo was the longer warranty period - 4 years/50,000 miles; 12 year rust protection - I live in Western Massachusetts where they salt and sand profusely in the winter; and the alloy wheels.  The interior is so luxurious to me and the people at Gengras Volvo in East Hartford gave me the best deal compared to 2 other Volvo dealers.  I won't really know how the AWD does in winter because I just got the car - so far the handling is stable; and because the wheelbase and size are larger than my old V40 I am adjusting to how it handles with parking and taking the curves - still breaking it in with only 302 miles so far.  The other thing that sold me was the cargo design and layout - my goal is to get to some National Parks to camp in the future - and the 250 horsepower and ability to tow were also part of my decision.  And I love the turbo - my V40 has such great pep - and I have loved that capacity.  The XC70 does weigh more - so haven't tested the pep of the turbo yet - still being cautious as I adjust to the new height - but love being able to just get in the car - rather than have to lower my body as I did in my V40.  And I just get out - so getting in and out is pretty neutral.  Love the proximity package and can see that when my hands are full it will be a blessing; the tailgate with auto up and down - fantastic! And the flat trunk - great for tailgating and picnics.  All the new technology - navigation; phone; etc. - I am still learning how to use this - so can't really make a call on this yet - plus this stuff didn't exist on my 2001 V40. And have to get the new garage door opener programmed yet - that's how new it is to me.

One year later - and I still LOVE my new XC 70!!  Currently, I have over 18,000 miles! The XC70 was a real champion in the winter - I was on a small hill and the lead car at the stop light was spinning and going no where - there was one car in between - I backed up my XC70 and with my AWD went around both cars up the same hill and went on my way!! Then I drove through a blowing snow storm down to New Jersey and again, the XC 70 made the trip - it is wonderful and the AWD is fantastic!  Before buying I had checked out the difference in the Haldex versus symmetrical drive - and I am convinced that the Haldex is the way to go.  Over the summer I was also able to test out the turbo when passing on some two lane roads in North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio and it has pep to get around when needed - on two lane roads I don't take time to pass - so the turbo punch does an amazing job and does it well considering the size and weight.  Still leaning to adjust to the new features, but the back up camera is one that has helped so much - it is a great feature and the hands free telephone is wonderful.  Other features that have come in handy - the remote start and the ability to lock the car from afar or to be sure it's locked - especially after parking at the airport.  Still adjusting to the higher center of gravity - especially as I was driving through West Virginia on some very long up and down curves - but it performed beautifully.  The car has been to Northern Michigan, across part of Canada and New York state!  When going across Canada - I was trying to figure out how to get the odometer to switch to kilometers per hour - still have to look that one up - so I turned to the fuel consumption feature where I based my best guess when it indicated I was consuming 100 kmh to estimate the speed I should be going.  Compared to my old low road hugging V40 - it takes time to learn how to steer a car with a higher center of gravity and higher ground clearance - which I need for the snow - but as I am learning - the car is performing beautifully.  And I am so happy
 with the service department at the Gengras Volvo dealer in East Hartford.   One year later - and know I made the right decision to buy the XC70!!  I can't believe they still don't make this car!

Okay, my odometer now reads 28,921 - I have been racking up the miles. Still love my XC70 and it has taken everywhere I need to go up and down the East coast - summer, winter, fall and spring. And amazingly it still cranked this winter when the temperatures hung in the -10 to -18 range for three weeks in the morning. The folks at Gengras Volvo are still doing a great job for all me service and I couldn’t be happier with my “new” Volvo.

My odometer now reads over 81,000 miles and still love my car and am totally thrilled with the visibility.  I am a short person and the ability to see is obstructed by cars with those swept up backs - but this car still has great windows to see all around.  And it can be a real work horse when you have to move boxes and load up the back.  I am still so thrilled to own this car!

volvo,xc70,2016,David Abrams, 11/15/2016,Best Car I've Ever Owned!,5,"I've had my XC70 for about a month and have just over 1,000 miles on it.  So far, I'm loving the vehicle more each time I drive it.  This car is simply a pleasure to drive.  It's quiet and comfortable on the road.  The technology is amazing and very well thought out.  Every time I get in, I'm impressed at how the design blends elegance and function.  I really feel like this is a special vehicle and I'm at a loss to understand why Volvo is discontinuing it.  I'd been considering the XC-70 and the Subaru Outback for the past several years.  However, having made the purchase, I'm really glad that I went with the Volvo.  Having test drove the Outback I can say that it doesn't come close to the ride my XC-70 provides.  Also, the seats in the XC-70 are simply amazing.  They're the most comfortable car seats I've ever experienced.  Some reviewers complain that the car is sluggish or doesn't handle well, but that's not been my experience.  It's not a small car, so it's not as nimble as a sports car might be, but it feels solid on the road and the acceleration seems more than adequate to me.

volvo,xc70,2016,FirstVolvo, 03/17/2017,Safety First,5,"Except for the fact that this unit must have some infrared sign saying 'Hit Me' in it, I am actually thrilled by the purchase.  At 600 miles, before the first installment was due, a deer jumped in front of the car while it traveled 60 MPH.  Front airbags deployed and car brought itself to safe stop.  Two occupants, including a 93 y.o. man, climbed out unscathed and without post accident issues.  Volvo safety operators immediately called the car and summoned police, EMT squad , and fire truck.  Out of state repair at Volvo dealership in Syracuse NY was exemplary.  Now with 13,000 miles, the car was rear ended by 1 ton pick up truck with dual rear wheels.  XC-70 bumper and hitch took brunt of impact.  Volvo drove home, but offending pick up was not so lucky.  Volvo hitch saved much rear end damage and transferred much of the impact to the colliding vehicle.  Dealership service in two different states has been excellent.  This is an extremely safe and comfortable vehicle, although I could do without further safety system tests.

volvo,xc70,2016,Milan, 05/04/2019,Couldn't resist,5,"When I drove my sister's 2002 XC70 last year I couldn't believe how comfortable this car still was and how smooth the car handled and sounded. Had a chance to test drive the 2016 FWD XC70 and was seduced by this Viking beauty immediately. Didn't need the AWD and prefer the great gas mileage with the FWD. This car was superior to Highlander, Outback, V60, and a few other mid range SUV's that I had a chance to test drive. Seat comfort is equal to our 2013 Sienna Limited. Road noise in XC70 is minimal. This car is a refreshing alternative to cookie cutter Outbacks and SUV's. Audio controls are dated but sound system is excellent. I have to say that I feel much safer driving this very solid wagon. Both sons fit comfortably in the rear seats and they are 6'3"" and 6'5"". My back feels great after driving 3 to 3.5 hours per day!

volvo,xc70,2016,Irving Gates, 03/04/2019,Bought the car out of the lease!,5,"XC70 discontinued after 2016. Disaster. This is by far the most comfortable and satisfying car I have ever driven (I am 80). I leased it and my lease is up in April. No other car will fit my bill so far. Love to have an electric but no place for charger.

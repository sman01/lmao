ferrari,portofino,2019,Bnkrboy, 09/28/2019,Horsepower the Italian way!,5,"The Portofino is NOT a cheap Ferrari. The build quality and R&D that went into the Portofino is absolutely top notch. This car is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Push the revs above 5k and the whole car changes. It’ll surprise you, know where you want to go and have the car pointed that direction before slamming the accelerator to the floor! Truly the next generation of Ferrari’s commitment to top quality materials and design. This is a drivers car.

ferrari,portofino,2019,SirWallSt, 09/13/2020,A Very Satisfied Portofino Owner,5,"It took six months for my Ferrari Portofino to be built and shipped to my eagerly awaiting garage. It proved to be worth the wait. While I rarely drive it, as it’s 3,430 miles will attest to, I enjoy its ownership everyday. "
ferrari,360,2001,Duane Lyons, 11/02/2002,360 Modena Review,4,"This is the most awesome Ferrari I have 
owned! Great looks and performance! 
Much better than the 355 and 550."
ferrari,360,2001,catman, 06/07/2003,360 in vegas,5,"Having owned Porsches all my adult life 
even though Ferraris were available, 
the 360 Spider with F1 trans was a car 
to drive everyday as the Porsche. The 
hard part to find one. I finally 
acquired one and it has been a ball. 
Sitting still the car moves people and 
on the highway it moves the driver. The 
Tubi exhaust gives you that added plus 
going through the underpasses and 
tunnels, takes it right to Monte Carlo 
and F1 races."
ferrari,360,2001,Porsche Crazy, 09/05/2005,"Always Wanted One, Finally Got One",5,"We've had the Spider almost a year and have enjoyed every moment.  Not only is it reliable but gets more thumb's up from people on the road than our 355 Berlinetta or 911 Turbo ever did.  Lots of power, excellent sound, great handling; this car is a complete package.  "
ferrari,360,2001,Adam Rappin, 06/11/2002,Excellent,5,"This is the greatest car you can ever 
buy. It has leather interior and very 
very comfortable."
ferrari,360,2001,Speedy, 10/14/2008,360 Modena NY,4,"Upgraded from a Porshe 911. As far as the handling, it's hard to say. The 911 is like a roller coaster on a track. The sound and the power of the 360 is amazing! The car screams so loud, you really do not need a radio in this car. The exhaust is music to my ears. All in all, it's AWSOME !!!"
ferrari,360,2001,RobertMcDonald, 06/21/2002,Great car... to constantly be repairing,3,"Ah, Ferraris... Nothing quite like 
them in the world. The 360 Modena is a 
great example. Performance, beauty, 
and the reliability of a Mazda or 
Ford. No, worse than that. Look 
forward to constant repairs, many 
annoying problems, and spending a lot 
of time at the dealership. Do yourself 
a favor and only plan on using it on 
weekends. Day to day, I'll take an NSX 
or 911."
ferrari,360,2001,adam penske, 06/27/2002,What Was I Thinking?,4,"It's gorgeous!  It's fantastic.  But 
it's still Viper fodder.  What ever 
happened to the days that Ferrari meant 
the absolute best?"
ferrari,360,2001,James J. Cone, Esq.,One Great Car,4,"Ferrari has outdone themselves with 
this beauty.  This car handles so well 
it makes diving fun.  I recommend that 
you take lessons on hw to drive a 
performance car first, this was you can 
enjoy the ride so much more.  I can't 
wait for next summer when I will buy my 
third Ferrari, The Enzo."
ferrari,360,2001,redpoorsche, 05/17/2004,Moody Modena,4,"I love my modena...as far as specialty 
cars go, it is one one of the most 
reliable.  Lots of trunk room and 
behind the seat room if you have the 
carbon fiber racing seats.  I call it 
moody because it is very specific about 
EVERYTHING you do, from foot on the 
brake, resetting the ignition kill for 
the alarm, to turning off the car in 
gear.   There are lots of rules and 
regulations you have to abide by in 
order to drive this car or you will be 
buzzed and beeped at constantly.  If 
you are type A, it should be no problem!"
ferrari,360,2001,Rick, 06/03/2005,360,5,An all around excellent car.  What an improvement over the F355
ferrari,360,2001,ChiCrazy, 04/26/2006,One of the best,3,"Outside of my McLaren and Lamborgini Diablo (both are silver), this is my favorite weekend car.  My 360 Spyder is red. My ex-girlfriend liked the syling of this one best.   For comfort, I go with my Arnage R Turbo or Phantom though - but I'll leave that review for those pages :)   "
ferrari,360,2002,ScuderiaF1, 08/22/2008,"A magnificient, but unreliable beauty",3,"Stalled the first day I had it. Engine warning light came on second day. After a week the ""Slow Down"" warning light came on and it would occasionally not start...unless you had someone rock the car back and forth while you tried to get the transmission in to neutral using the paddles. It has been in the service garage longer than my own garage. It's under an extended warranty. It is an absolutely gorgeous piece of art though and it converted me (a Lamborghini enthusiast) to Ferrari when I saw it at the dealership. It is the most beautiful looking Ferrari in my opinion - better looking than the newer F430. The sound is great also. The glass hood over the engine is a nice touch. "
ferrari,360,2002,tim zhou, 01/30/2003,my ferrari,4,"after driving the car i have never been so impressed. the 
performance was awsome and the tarction was great. overall a 
perfect car."
ferrari,360,2002,Cal, 03/19/2002,Ferrari Drive,4,"The Ferrari 360 is an excellent car the Exterior Design is the best, it looks like the car from the future and the speed of it and the sreering is excellent."
ferrari,360,2002,Puppy's Parts, 08/05/2002,Good car -,4,"I absolutly love the car. The roof 
mechanism is outrageous and I enjoy 
watching it. The design is spectacular 
both inside and out. The F1's good - 
slow starts are easy, fast starts are 
easy, but moderate starts take some 
time to get used to especially when 
the gearbox is cold."
ferrari,360,2002,rol, 02/27/2004,super car,5,"I have a 2003 Porsche C4 Cab as well 
and this is 4 times the car at twice 
the price! Fuel milage a solid 18mpg at 
triple digit speeds. (no Ferraris have 
good milage around town) Drove all 
around Europe with it as well; only the 
550 Maranello is better! Get 370 miles 
per tank of gas. A keeper!"
ferrari,360,2002,cjblack, 08/16/2016,Disappointed,2,"This car is a piece of junk. After waiting my whole life to buy a Ferrari, it broke down the first weekend I had it. Got it serviced, worked fine for a week and broke down again. Just take a look at the Ferrari forums online and you'll see how unreliable these cars are. It perplexes me that a car as respected as a Ferrari can be so terrible. As with all Ferraris, your mechanic will spend more time worth it than you will. I got rid of mine and will never but a Ferrari (or any Italian car) again.

ferrari,360,2002,Gzagasoccer510, 05/29/2002,Damn what a nice car!,5,"The purchase of my ferrari was the best 
i ever made! this car handled like a 
dream and is the best looking thing on 
two wheels. as you entered the car it 
felt like you were entering the cocpit 
of of an F-16. a well proportioned 
wheelbase let the beast fly 
effortlessly around those hair pin 
turns. amazng horsepower gave the best 
acceleration i have felt in a car. many 
a head turned while i drove around ; 
this is the BEST looking car made!"
ferrari,360,2002,MilleniumFalcon, 06/03/2002,Fast,4,"Well, out of the three Ferraris,two 
Porsches, four Beemers, and two Benzes 
I own, I would have to say it lies 
between my Porsche 911 GT2, and my MB 
Cl600 overall.  It has excellent 
acceleration, and the car is an 
absolute babe magnet."
ferrari,360,2002,milanista, 06/25/2002,Not a bad car at all,4,"This is my 4th Ferrari (512BB, 512 TR, 
355 Spyder before this one), and by far 
the best one in terms of driving 
pleasure, reliability, and styling. The 
car is very stable at high speed 
(160+); in fact more so than when doing 
less than 100.  The only problem is 
that SUV/truck drivers tend not to see 
you when you're too close behind them."
ferrari,360,2002,Fosters_360, 11/12/2002,Excellent,5,"The 360 Spider is everything you want 
plus a little more. The spider 
represents the history and exceptional 
quality Ferrari can give you. The 360 
has no flaws, but when you rap the 
RPM's near red line, there feels like 
there's a little bit more to go until 
you finally max the vehicle. The one of 
many qualities that seperate this type 
of car from any other, has to be the 
sound, espically when the top is down 
and your running up a mountain pass at 
7500 RPM's. There's just nothing like 
it."

ferrari,360,2002,Duane Lyons, 04/02/2002,360 Modena review,4,"Awesome car I've owned for 12 months. Incredible performance, styling and fun factor! A ""10"" all the way. Big money but you get what you pay for. Incredible car!"
ferrari,360,2002,Funcarhotone, 04/02/2002,looker,4,Not a bad car but way to expensive and you must have it services all to early and often at the dealer and they charge way to much.  The car is a very nice streetable race car and gets lots of attention.  This is my 3rd Ferrari and I like the improvents they have made.
ferrari,360,2003,bahram, 09/04/2003,SO QUICK & SO FUN,5,"So much quicker than my previous 355 
F1 spider. More sexier exterior. Much 
roomier interior. The F1 gearbox is 
much smoother.  "
ferrari,360,2003,Mike, 02/27/2016,"Perfect ""starter"" Ferrari!",5,"This car is now 16 years old and it still looks great and performs very well. Styling is timeless and is unmistakable Ferrari (Pininfarina design). V8 3.6L naturally aspirated engine has been solid and pulls strong at 400hp and 275lb/ft of torque. The car only weighs around 3,000lbs. F1 transmission (about 90% of 360s made) is accurate and exciting to drive but opt for the polished, gated six speed for traditional Ferrari feel (but expect to pay a purchase price premium for this). First all aluminum Ferrari and ""modern"" for maintenance, which cost much much less than its predecessors (no need to remove engine anymore for cam belts). I've owned mine for 4 years and put about 2k miles per year. It's been a very reliable and extraordinary car to own and drive. I regularly use it around town and once per year take it on a road trip from NYC to Montréal for the Grand Prix.  Very reliable, fast, handles amazing, easy to drive, and reasonable from ownership and maintenance perspective. But what I love the most about this car is the sound of the exhaust from the high revving (8,500 rpm redline) V8 mates with Tubi (factory approved) muffler. Note at 17k miles I replace the clutch, which typically lasts 15k-20k miles.

Porsche's,Audi's,Mercede's,Jaguar's and

close to this in performance, balance,

would. Simply one of the most exciting 
puchases I have ever made. Most people

ferrari,360,2003,sfboggsz, 10/02/2003,Heaven,5,"My first Ferrari. Incredible. I didn't 
buy it for fuel economy or riding 
comfort. What I found was a sports car 
that could be driven in the City as 
well as an animal on the open road. 
What a thrill!!!!

I highly recommend the F-1 Paddle 
Shifters as they create a unique 
driving experience and make you better 
than you actually are as a driver."

I own is the F50.  The power is great 
and is so much fun actually putting it 
down on the road.  Shifting is a bit 
notchy at anything under 8/10ths pace, 
but the only complaint is the lack of 
quality stero to compliment the song 
of the V8.  Forget everything else, 
there is no substitute, and wait until 
it gets improved with a little 
tweaking."

ferrari,430-scuderia,2008,ccmd75013, 05/24/2009,For enthusiasts only,4,"The Scuderia is a serious racing car which happens to be street legal. I traded my Lamborghini Galardo for the Scuderia and what a difference! The Scuderia comes with no radio, floor mats or any creature comforts. The acceleration is neck snapping and the exhaust note changes loudness depending on the pedal pressure becoming extremely loud at above 5000 RPM. The steering is extremely light (big difference from the Lambo)and controlling this light car in hard acceleration takes a bit of getting used to. The ceramic brakes are extremely touchy and again take a while to get used to. The seats are very hard and even short drives can be hard on the back. Wouldn't recommend this car to first timers"
ferrari,456m,2001,Allan, 09/28/2010,An actual owner,4,"Driving a V-12 Ferrari feels like an event every time you get behind the wheel.  The sound, the tactile impression of the seats and all of the controls is very satisfying and the performance is stunning-lots of torque, effortless acceleration, perfectly balanced steering, cornering grip and powerful brakes, as you would expect.  But there are maddening quality issues that far cheaper cars solved decades ago: alarm sirens that die, motor mounts that need to be replaced, windows that don't fit properly and HVAC control surfaces that get sticky with age."

performance four seater, but a few 
issues mostly around window seal 
integrity and the electrical system.  
The car left me stranded once.  Worse 
issue of all is a MSRp of $240K and a 
two year later value of $120K.  The

have never had to replace engine mounts 
before.  The customer service rep.  
told me that at 15,000 miles I have put 
more miles on my 550 than most owners.  
In fact he said, ""let's face it 90% of

Acceleration, handling, braking, style, sophistication well you name it and the 575 M does it as well, if not better, than any other performance automobile.   The 5.8 liter V-12 motor is smooth and docile while driving under normal conditions but under full throttle the motor seems even more powerful than the 515 h.p./ 588 lbs/ft ratings listed by the factory.  This motor mated to the F1 transmission provides an awesome powertrain, with the incredible dexterity of the motor and the effortless, instantaneous shifts make the 575 M an absolute pleasure."

for a little over a month, I love this 
car. It has been my lifelong dream to 
own a Ferrari, and I have no regrets. 
The sheer power of this vehicle is 
unbeleivable, though it can be used as 
a regular around-town vehicle. The 
insurance is a bit expensive, but its 
worth it to me. If you are looking for 
the ultimate sports car, you have found 
it! The only car that performs better 
than this beauty is the Lamborghini 
Murcilago, but to be honest the 
Murcilago is very unattractive and not 
as comfortable as far as seats go. 
There is no doubt in my mind that I 
made the wisest decision of my life."

the name lies in the engine, which has 
been denominated 575. The balanced 
lines and sober design that have made 
the Maranello an instant classic have 
remained intact.
When it came to looking at the style of 
the vehicle, the thinking behind it is 
to retain the balance and sober looks, 
which invested it with the status of an 
instant classic, fitting in perfectly

other than the Enzo, that Ferrari has 
manufactured this year. The power the 
575 has is amazing and as sucssesor to 
the 550 it's what Ferrari has done. A 
top speed of 202 mph and 0-60 in less 
than 5 seconds the car is the bomb! 
Also the F1 is very comfortable and the

with the racing heritage of Ferrari. My

my Ferrari isn tjut any, I had a 
veilside body kit put on it, a custom 
spoiler to fit the back, 21"" chrome ADR 
wheels in the back with 19"" ADR wheels 
in the front. And to top it all off I 
have a JL audio system put in it with

It is fast (0-60 in 3.6 seconds) , comfortable as a Mercedes SL 65 and in my opinion the most beautiful modern Ferrari ever built. Top review."
ferrari,599,2008,byron, 10/15/2008,A Monster,5,"Incredible driving experience.  Ride and quality is second to none.  The music of the V-12 along with the incredibly comfortable seats and power to take you anywhere, anytime is beyond compare.  The F-1 is very fast and intuitive.  A very balanced feel of superior steering, brakes and throttle. A much smoother ride than I ever imagined out of a super handling car."
ferrari,599,2008,AceOfRace, 01/05/2009,Exceptional All Rounder,4,"The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano is the best to ever come out of the prestigious marque. It's supremely fast but also tame enough to drive anyday. The engine is a 6.0L V12 derived from the Enzo. 611 horsepower is what you can expect. The car can really do anything you want it to and if you make a mistake on the road, it is much more forgiving than the likes of other RWD cars. Performance is amazing and the handling is almost to the level of the Bugatti Veyron. Anybody who has a passion for cars must take this out for a drive. The 599 hits every benchmark of supercar performance. Its a fantastic car that must be experienced first hand to get the most out of it."
ferrari,612-scaglietti,2005,Jacky , 04/18/2007,Disappointed!,4,"When I first purchased the car I was extremly thrilled. However, after few days I discovered so many faults in the car. The handling and performance of the car is amazing!! However: 1. The car had very strong smell of fuel inside. 2. Every hole in the road sounds like if the car was going to break down. 3. The handbrake did not stop the car! I sent the car to the Ferrari shop which tried several times to fix it. The service was very good however, the car continued to have the same faults. In my opinion $260,000 car should be perfect. This car is worth only for racing, not for daily use.  Don't buy this car.  Thanks"
ferrari,612-scaglietti,2005,boomer, 04/23/2005,nice,4,this is the smoothest Ferrari ever.  It is a better drive than the 575.  It will out drive any Aston Martin.

Its seats are outstanding.  The back seats have enough room.  the car even comes with a full trunk.  It actually gets decent gas mileage.  This is my third Ferrari in nine years and it is truly my favorite to date."
ferrari,612-scaglietti,2005,david byer, 05/07/2005,Best Ferrari Ever,4,"After ordering a Ferrari 360 Modeno and finding it too small for my 6'4"" frame, I decided to order the 456GT to be remodeled. Ferrari didn't know exactly when it would be coming in, so I just transfered my deposit and waited over four and a half years.  I recieved all the artists drawings, engineering pictures and eventually the final pictures of the first two cars to be shown at the Detroit auto show. Upon picking up my 612 Scaglietti I was first impressed with how solid it felt and how quiet and comfortable the interior was. Its instrumentation is simple, the stereo is great but what you get from this car mostly is an eye catching exotic car that isn't too exotic. Being over 40 years old it is the best car in the world to me."
ferrari,612-scaglietti,2005,John Arnold, 05/08/2005,Not What it Seems,3,"When I first bought the 2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, I was anticipating the greatest experience of my life.  It was a great car the first couple of days, but it lost its excitement fast.  The lack of a sporty design tends to not turn as many heads, but the power will take you off the line faster than any other car you will find."

Waited nearly Two years, but honestly worth it.    Bentley, Aston, Lambo, no longer carry this type of Ferrari substance, nor its price tag.

ferrari,612-scaglietti,2005,Noel Thomas Patton, 08/01/2005,612,5,"I got my manual 6 speed in June of 2005 and it has exceeded my expectations. It is truly everything that a gentleman's GT car should be. Stunning styling, great craftmanship, easy to use controls, and of course great performance. It also has enough room to load up friends and/or luggage and take off ona Grand Tour, something you can't do in a Lambo."

The straight line tracking and solid acceleration on a fairly large body, is almost mind boggling!  When you pull up to valet the 612 Scaglietti, you are swarmed like nothing ever witnessed.  Quality has been good, although a few minor electronic computer gremlins that were fixed with a software update."
ferrari,612-scaglietti,2005,Jonathan Docs, 10/06/2005,612 Scaglietti F1 is Pure Joy,5,"This car provides stunning performance without sacrificing the comfort.  The engine is downright frightening.

Yes downright expensive ""close to 300 thousand"". However I am satisfied after purchase."

It also is very good in the winter or when driving on wet slick streets."
ferrari,612-scaglietti,2006,Don Brodie, 01/02/2007,612 After One Year,4,"The reliability of this car is only fair. I initially had severe computer problems that started the car on 6-cylinders and after two minutes switched to 12 cylinders. The car shook and sputtered for those two minutes. This was corrected after two visits in which a computer re-programming took place. Now I have my check engine light constantly flashing even after being deactivated, twice. It again recently activated, and I have to bring it in again for the third time. "

Peoples' jaws drop and heads are flying from all directions when I drive by. The exterior is great with side scallops which look great and lines that cut between the headlamps. The rear trunk has two additional storage compartments which is great. The interior is supperb with automatic climate control, automatic headlamps, rain sensing windshield wipers, electric seats, heated seats, electric mirrors, and rear seats are just as comfortable as the front ones. I warn you though this is not an everyday car, considering I payed over $300,000 dollars it. The steering mounted sport button is 10 times better than normal auto."

This car is the ultimate in beauty, luxury, performance and adrenaline stimulant.  The car looks gorgeous with the top up or down. It is a shame that it has a great sound system because it stays off so that you can hear the engine.  It is not fussy about usual road dips and driveways.

Its shape is more beautiful than any other car in the world. On the road, it commands a presence of mystique and prestige that only a Ferrari delivers. I had a 360 Modena before this model. The F430 is sharper and more modern in appearance. The shifting of F1 is more smooth, and the overall handling is far superior.  "

A Testarossa, Maranello 550 now this beautiful example of styling, performance and unbelievable driving experience. This is such a vast improvement over the 360 which I also tested. It has the ability to transform from an every day drive, to a full race performance all by simply switching the settings on your steering wheel. The performance is a given, but the exhaust sound alone takes you to the track and turns heads in amazement. The handling is superb. Highly recommend.

The drive is sensational and incomparably satisfying. Compared to the Modena 360 I had, its looks are more modern and aggressive. Its interior is exquisitely detailed with soft leather and stitching with its feel and smell that only a Ferrari delivers and better than even an Louis Vuiton handbag. The F1 is much more smooth than a Modena 360. The handling is razor sharp, superior to the 360, a world apart from almost any other vehicle on the market. A true appreciation of a Ferrari can only come from actual ownership and prolonged driving experience. "

Its fantastic acceleration does not even need to be mentioned. The attention you get from others around you when drive the F430 is something you need to get used to if you don't like attention.

The engine, while an improvement over the 360 is light years behind the V10 powered Gallardo. The F1 shifter is still jerky at max revs but is also an improvement over the 360. Reliability is a big issue. In one month air conditioning, paint and trim issues were so bad I sold the car."
ferrari,f430,2005,fred, 07/25/2005,Cool car,5,The ferrari F430 is a new addition to my sports car colletion. It is very fast but not yet very comfortable.This is my 5th Ferrari to purchase since 2002. I defenently recommend this car.
ferrari,f430,2005,MGD, 05/07/2005,One of the best from Ferrari,4,"The 2005 Ferrari F430 has to be one of the greatest cars the prancing horse has ever built.  It is beautiful and fast and a ton of fun to drive.  If you have the cash this is a MUST have.  Its easy to drive and its suspension settings can be changed to suit the driver's needs and the outside conditions.  It is amazing.  Its nearly as fast as an Enzo, it is just a bullet. It has 483HP and goes 0-60 MPH in 3.8 seconds.  I love my F430!"
ferrari,f430,2006,ferrarifan, 02/14/2006,2006 F430,5,"I am more than satisfied with the 2006 F430. Although I loved the Modena 360 I used to have, the F430 is much better than the 360 in many ways. It is far smoother and faster. Its design is more aggressive and modern, although one could argue that the 360 had more artistic lines. They are both beautiful, but different. The interior is covered with the finest leather you will see in any car with beautiful stitchings. Its instrumentation is functional and elegant. The HiFi version is terrific with clean sound and base. Its handling, speed, agility, and feel are second to none. It is one of the most beautiful cars ever created with its presence noticed on any road with admirers everywhere. "
ferrari,f430,2006,PERRIE, 06/14/2006,Incredible Car,5,"I love my new F430 spider.  It is an incredible improvement from my 2003 F360.  It's much more luxurious, has a better ride, acceleration etc.  The biggest difference is how smooth the shifting has become and the ride quality.  It looks fantastic and has the best interior I have seen on a sports car.  While I certainly wouldn't drive it everyday I find I am using it much more than the F360.  I can't wait to take it out whenever I have time.  My wife's biggest complaint is that everyone looks at the car.  It is expensive but worth every penny."
ferrari,f430,2006,F.SALA, 10/22/2006,WOW!,4,"I love my F430 Spider.  It is by far the best Ferrari I've ever driven and owned.  It is as smooth as a luxury car and handles like it's on railroad tracks. When you drive this car at full pedal to the metal the sound is out of this world. The best feature: no more timing belt and valve ajustments services. I'm going for another ride, caio!"
ferrari,f430,2006,Ernesto, 10/22/2006,F430 Spider F1,4,"After I had experienced the Ferrari Testarossa in 1999 I also purchased the Maserati Spider 2002 as a companion. Then one day I noticed the F430 in the lot at the dealer while picking up the Maserati after service.  I fell in love with this new Ferrari car.  I had to go and purchased it the following week and I have no regrets since.  It is a blast of fun, expecially when driving thru a tunnel, the experience and feeling is the same as if I was driving a Formula One.  The shifting of gears is so quick and the engine responds immediately, the noise is phenomenal. The acceleration is exhilarating.  This is the best car in my stable."
ferrari,f430,2006,ferraridrew, 02/24/2007,Ferrari 430 Spyder Coupe,5,"This car is good. It's very fast, agile, cool looking, and makes me as popular as a 17 year old. I purchased it in North Carolina."
ferrari,f430,2006,Jack, 04/22/2006,Amazing Car,5,"The Ferrari F430 Challenge is the best car that I have ever driven and I have had them all.  It is so smooth and light to drive! Wow! It is expensive, but well worth it! "
ferrari,f430,2006,F1Guy, 11/07/2008,F1 Ferrari F430,4,"Have owned 50-60 autos in my lifetime; many of the higher end types. The F430 beats them all, hands down. This car has it all; style, presence, speed, quickness, a wonderful, yet sporty ride and a great (F1) tranny. It is the best overall balance of sporting and stylistic ride and handling I have ever owned. It costs more than many houses, but if you love to drive, and appreciate fine automobiles, this is the top of the heap. The sound of the car, either at idle or WOT, will sell you on it, even if nothing else does! Do it if you can...you won't be disappointed.  "
ferrari,f430,2006,banx, 08/22/2010,Get the Rock Star Treatment,3,"It's a fantastic vehicle, all you can possibly imagine. While a few tenths of a second off the 0-60 pace of a Corvette Z06 or a Nissan GT-R, those cars don't get the looks or attention this car gets. A Porsche 911 Turbo is almost invisible next to this Ferrari. It has the F1 transmission, but be WARNED, it's not reliable. The entire transmission had to be replaced under warranty at 3K miles. The OEM optional Blaupunkt Hi-powered stereo just croaked at 5K miles (not covered by warranty), even though it had barely been used the past 12 months (engine sound was too intoxicating to listen to the radio for more than 5 minutes) and was never played at more than low volume in the driveway."
ferrari,f430,2006,phil, 09/30/2015,One of the best cars I have ever driven!,5,"This car is awesome. Its my 1st year owning it and I have to tell you there is nothing that can compare to this ferrari. Just the name and model says it all!

ferrari,f430,2007,claudio, 10/15/2007,Dream come true,4,"Waited 3 years for this car, as I put a deposit for a 360 which was later discontinued to make room for the F430.  It was well worth the wait!  This car really lives up to the Ferrari reputation.  The design, performance and overall driving experience is amazing.  Very easy to drive in heavy traffic as well, but when the road opens up is when you are treated to what this car is all about. Best car I've ever driven. Past cars. MB SL 55 MB CLK 55 Porsche Boxster S Porsche Cayenne Turbo Maserati GrandSport MC Victory (current) Maserati Quattroporte Sport GT (current)."
ferrari,f430,2007,Bill Holbrook, 08/15/2015,Fun!Fun!Fun!,5,"Unlike some of the other reviews I see I actually own an F430.The thrill of walking out into the garage and looking at my car and knowing that I can start it up and drive it whenever I want cannot be overemphasized.The car is so much fun to drive I can easily overlook the flaws (mainly the cost of everything).I can't go anywhere without being asked about it or having myself photographed.The way it drives around corners is always exciting and the top end is also quite exciting.I know mine goes at least 170 with the limiting factor being the driver not the car.The gas mileage has surprised me getting 17.9 on the last trip I took or 6321 miles.No mechanical issues , no overheating , no plug problems, heck, no problems at all.This is without a doubt the most fun of any car I have driven, well the 458 drives better but I don't own one.I have 14 cars right now with one a drag car that runs in the mid 9s but my F430 brings a smile to my face and anyone I take with me every time I get into it.

ferrari,f430,2007,LEXUSRY, 09/20/2008,not worth it,3,"With the high price that consumers pay, you would expect the parts to last longer than the cheapest made vehicle out there in public. These engine, brake, electric  parts are cheaply made. It reminds me of the cheap made Volkswagen car that my son use to drive. Last, what a crap stereo sound system it has. "
ferrari,ff,2015,rbauer69@gmail.com, 08/02/2015,V12 SUV,5,"I've owned this beauty since Dec. 458 Spider prior scared me into a trade. Best GT car by far. Passes in no time. Listen to the scream...

ferrari,superamerica,2005,audikrazy, 12/20/2005,LOVE IT! :),4,"This car is amazing, i thought it would be a good investment because it is a rare build.  I hope that i am correct.  My wife wants to dirve this car 24/7!!!  My son wants to take it to prom!!! it shows that everyone wants this car.  !!!!!!"

lincoln,aviator,2003,v_sanders1, 05/16/2013,Bought this car new LOVE IT,5,I've owned this car for 11 years new and it still looks beautiful inside and out. No problems what so ever and I only change the oil when it says to. It drives wonderful and is very safe (airbags even in back). I would buy this car all over again but they quit making them during our economic slump :( You will not go wrong with this year model 2003
lincoln,aviator,2003,Al, 03/23/2010,Only drive while under warranty,4,"Its a pretty good bet that the transmission will need some work. At about 35k miles, mine needed to be overhauled while on a road trip out of state. Ignition coils were recalled and I would recommend just getting all 8 original coils replaced, BEFORE they go out, which eventually they will. Overall, I've enjoyed owning this Aviator but now that it's well past the Lincoln warranty and extended warranty expiration, it's time to let this Aviator get some rest before it puts me in the poorhouse. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,Rsmith, 07/08/2009,Extremely Poor Reliability,3,"Enjoy the vehicle, plenty of power, comfort and overall utility.  However, with only 75,000 miles, the following maintenance issues have developed. On three wheels the bearing failed,$1,600, the number eight cylinder is bad, requiring over $4,000 in repairs, transmission failed, over $3,000 repair, driver side window motor failed, $350 in repair, back window hatch cracked, and now the shift lever is bad.  The dealer did not treat me as a valued customer, but tried to gouge me and stated that I should get rid of the vehicle. This is by far the most unreliable vehicle that I have ever owned. Wil never purchase another Lincoln or so called American car."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Rancher, 03/12/2010,2003 Lincoln Aviator premium Edition,4,"This vehicle rocks. purchased new I now have over 130,000 miles and still going strong. The ride and comfort is still exceptional. While this model does not have stability control or the roll over features it is a great vehicle. The car can be at a comfortable 70-75 miles per hour, and then go into passing mode quickly with no lag and hit over 90 with ease, and yeah I have done that both new and with current total miles. The engine is strong and sure. I am now having an issue with the differential and am looking for another Aviator to purchase. I have towed a 21 ft boat, two jet skies, with this car,(no, not all at once) and it still tracks smoothly with no sway. Would buy this again."

lincoln,aviator,2003,pam, 02/19/2010,little problems,4,"I bought my aviator used it had 22,000 miles. I love it. No big problems. Replaced a coil after 106,000 miles. The dash board lights some times go on & off, but easy to deal with. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,None, 11/06/2008,Another Lincoln Lemon,2,"I liked the look and the interior, so I bought one used with 60k mi. However, 4 months out of the dealer and I'm looking at $1500 of repairs on various plastic engine parts that have deteriorated. It took the dealer nearly a week to diagnose.  Conveniently these aren't covered under their useless extended warranty. One of the rear doors doesn't unlock. I got the metal panel crack underneath the tailgate window that I read many others got within 3 months. Fuel mileage dips into single digits in city driving.  Oh well, another Ford, another shoddy car. At least it's not a Chrysler or the bumpers would be falling off by now."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Kamil, 11/19/2008,Stay Away!,3,"Rides nice, comfort and luxury, but American car makers still have a long way to go!  This car is very unreliable, had so many issues, transmission, heated seats, fog lights, torque converter, remote starter. Americans can create nice options but can't seem to make them last. The car has 54k and has problems like it was over 150,000! The electronics stink on this thing. Every fuse or some module goes every month. It's still under warranty, and that's how I will sell it!"
lincoln,aviator,2003,vinny, 02/15/2009,Great SUV,4,"I bought my 2003 Aviator new. The truck is quick and beautiful looking. I got it in the pearl white with the white leather. Not the best choice with kids but still looks good after 6 years. I did have two problems which the dealer fixed under the warranty .The idler pulley was giving off a whining noise. They replaced it and it fixed the problem . The second problem was a rough idle and it would come close to stalling. It was a vacuum leak that the dealer fixed with the warranty. I have 61,000 on it now and it has started to idle rough again but I'm sure it is a simple fix . People who complain about the interior of this truck are crazy. It is very luxurious and comfortable. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,abqlincoln, 02/03/2010,Never an issue,5,"We have loved this for 2 years and have loved it. A lot of people complain about the mileage but for a full sized SUV to get 21 mpg on the highway at 80 mph I have no complaints at all.  Around town we get 15 mpg but again, I never expected this to be an economy car.  It has been very reliable and has never given us an issue."
lincoln,aviator,2003,aprilfire, 09/17/2002,this truck is great,5,"i have a mercedes ml 320 and it doesnt 
compare t omy new lincoln. I love 
everything about this truck"
lincoln,aviator,2003,E. Mayer, 11/16/2003,This ain't no Explorer,4,"We were in the market for an SUV with 3rd row 
seating. If this is you, do yourself a favor and 
test drive this SUV. You'll understand why 
most limo's are Licoln's - it's all about the ride 
and this SUV delivers. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,Lindsey, 06/27/2006,Pure Excellence,4,"This SUV is more than amazing. The luxury and capability is just awesome. It drives like a sports car and handles is so smooth and luxurious, I don't even want to complain about the gas mileage. It is not a commuter that is for sure. We just bought it and have been fighting over who gets to drive it everyday since. 50k Miles and drives better than the new Caddy DTS!  Love it!"
lincoln,aviator,2003,armymechanic, 06/23/2015,I just got my first aviator,5,"I was very surprised with its power and fuel mileage and I'm curious at how well it will tow a boat up and down steep hills because I'm considering getting a small 18' pontoon boat I'm wondering if it can muster it and Lincoln SUVs are the best and are really reliable and i just got my aviator but last year I had the privilege to own my very first Lincoln and I have always wanted an SUV and 4x4 and a Lincoln and I ended up knocking all out with one stone I had a 1999 navigator which was totaled out 9months later I got t-boned by a 21year old and now I have my aviator it's been a blessing from God to have an other Lincoln they are worth it and I walked away from rolling 3 times they are the best it's been a good vehicle very reliable I've had it almost 4 years now small minor complaints nothing big thank God
"
lincoln,aviator,2003,Great Vehicle, 03/18/2008,Excellant All Around Vehicle,4,"Go anywhere SUV, Go several times a year on out of state trips. The Aviator is the ultimate in comfort! Hit that seat warmer after a long day and ahhh! Our Aviator has 42K on it and has only needed the regular maint performed on it. I did replace the tires to one size up and that helped on the milage-AVG 19 mph allaround and up to 21 on the road. I also had the computer upgraded thru the dealer on a new program that has made it perform even better. No gripes here glad we have it as our all around veh and well worth the price!"
lincoln,aviator,2003,Horrible Vehicle, 05/30/2007,Never Never Never Never again,2,"This car has been nothing but problems. After owning the vehicle for two years the transmission had to be replaced.  When the third time repair did not fix the original problem.  I have had electrical problems from day one but no one can seem to figure out why. The auto-window doesn't work, the side view mirrors would change positions, the passenger seat heater does not work, the sound system takes about a minute to come on after the car is started. The steering wheel shimmies when braking, and there is a long whining sound when you start the vehicle in cold weather (which they can't seem to figure out why).  This vehicle is the most expensive I have owned and yet the worst purchase made."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Elias Farid B., 10/20/2016,"Repair,repair,repair transmission,cooling system,",2,"Bot brain new in 2003 $47k on the 3rd year after the warranty was over, repairs started constantly every other month had to visit the repair shop for some problem and currently it has 96,000 Miles and it is seating in AAMCO waiting for front differential ($2500) after changing the transmission cooling system that costed over $1400. No dealers had offered more than $500 to buy it as is (with broken differential) . This the story of my Aviator in nut shell
"
lincoln,aviator,2003,TheCaneMan, 12/05/2002,Not all it's cranked up to be !!!!,2,"Before buying -- test it for at least a 
day and I think you'll go with another 
vehicle.  

I sure wish I did !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
lincoln,aviator,2003,RJ , 07/20/2019,Lincoln. stinking!,1,"This is absolutely the worst truck I have ever owned!  Ford, Lincoln,  stink! Always a major issue with this truck, it has been an issue since day 1! It was always taken care of, but no matter what I do, it is a money pit! I have always owned Fords, never again!!! Ford did not take the buy out yrs ago, However,  Ford no longer makes parts to support older vehicles.  I asked Ford, what do I do, I can't find parts  for my truck. Fords responded by, buy a new truck!  I sure will, IT WON'T BE FORD!!!! I have owned Fords all my life, never again!  I did buy a new truck, Toyota!  Screw you Ford! Lincoln was a beautiful truck, a safe truck.  The safest truck you can have,  is one that doesn't run!!!! Suspension issues, dashboard lights kept shutting off,  tear hatch would not open, 1 transmission, 1 engine,  4 radiators,  4 wheel bearings,  drivers seat motor  broke, replaced with new motor,  died 1 yr later. Upper and lower control arms, good luck.in finding replacement parts. 3 compressors. Ford. Fix or repair daily. I wish I  had brought a different vehicle. This truck had low miles, I know why now.  It tows well, and constantly!  Ford owns the patent on the upper and lower control arms.  Friend owns 2012 Ford Explorer,  he can't find parts either.  Not my problem anymore!

lincoln,aviator,2003,ziear, 12/21/2008,"My first Lincoln, great SUV love it",4,I bought this Aviator for my birthday and drove it from Philidelphia to Atlanta it drove like a dreams and continues to.  Only thing that needs improving is the gas mileage. A fun hot ride.
lincoln,aviator,2003,LD, 11/12/2009,Love my Aviator,4,"Had my Aviator since 2003 and loved every day I have had it. I can't beleive they don't make them any more. For sure, I would go out and purchase another one. I also thought this about my Mark VII. I guess I am just hooked on a Lincolns."
lincoln,aviator,2003,'03 Aviator, 10/07/2002,The 2003 Aviator,4,"This SUV is #1 , Looks like the full 
size Navi but if a small package,
it is the benchmark for its segment 
betas out all the Imports BUY 
AMERICAN!! comfort and exceptional 
luxury superb performance  agile

lincoln,aviator,2003,Pierrot, 10/02/2003,What's wrong with this Avaitor?,3,"I have 2250 miles on my 03 Avaitor and 
it went into the shop the day after 
delivery.  It had a vibration on 
throughout the vehicle.  It has been in 
the shop for twenty 20 days during the 
last 35 days.  After replacement of 
many drivetrain parts and tires the 
dealer says that all Avaitors are like 
this according to Ford engineers. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,Topeagle, 10/15/2003,Great Performer,4,"It is a solid performing car; interior 
is top-notch. Negatives: the tilt 
steering mechanism is a step backwards -
 awkward and it can interfere exiting 
the vehicle. Rear view mirror is rather 
cheap considering the price of the 
vehicle. Lincoln should also have 
included the automatic emergency brake 
release that is in the Navigators, 
tough to bend when you get older and a 
little heavier!
I chose the Kitty Hawk because only way 
to get black leather seats but the 
chrome wheels are a must. Tires should 
have remained OWL instead of solid 
black.  
The ride is great.  
Lincoln should also have designed with 
dual exhausts!!!"
lincoln,aviator,2003,Pierrot, 11/05/2003,Shake and rattle,3,"The day after I took delivery of this 
vehicle was in the shop.  It has been 
in the shop on 6 different occasions 
for over 30 days.  There is a vibration 
throughout the drivetrain including the 
steering wheel which manifest itself by 
shaking when driving down the road. It 
is noticed by noise and feel.  Ford 
says that all Avaitors are this way so 
be aware. If you feel your hand shaking 
or hear vibrations it is not in your 
head.  Other problems include oil, 
leaks  tire sensor failures and bad 
tires.    "
lincoln,aviator,2003,tired owner, 04/15/2004,Tired of Fighting,3,"I do alot of driving-23,000 miles in 8 
months!I owned a Navigator before this 
Aviator and loved it. Since 2000 miles, 
it shimmies at 75mph.They've replaced 
tires, rotored brakes and can't seem to 
fix it. The driver's seat moves and 
they say it's normal after replacing 
the seat and track!  I'm tired of 
fighting to get a quality SUV for my 
money! I have not gotten anyone to 
help - even at Customer Relations 
Headquarters!"

lincoln,aviator,2003,Steve, 03/24/2005,Can't wait to get rid of this vehicle,2,"After sitting a stop lights and shaking and having 2 different dealers...the service managers are brothers...tell me 3 times that this Lincoln should sit at stop lights and shake..yeah right ! and having the rear differential replaced at 3000 miles...the a/c smells and the car still has only 12000 miles on it I can't wait to get rid of this piece of ""junk"".  This is my fifth new Lincoln product in 10 years and it is not only my last Lincoln product but my last American car.  No-one seems to care that this car absolutely runs awful including Lincoln customer service."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Mike & Barb, 09/19/2005,'03 Aviator,4,"First off, we love the 4 valve DOHC engine. Have it in a 97 Cobera, '04 Mustang Mach-1 '04 Mercury Marauder and the '03 Aviator, After ~25K Barb gets about 20MPG on average, not bad, we think. Sadly, they're discontinuing this great vehicle, so we're turning ours in for an '05 Aviator. We have never had a single service issue, and the dealership has been absolutely wonderful when it's time for regular service, free of charge, of course. We usually keep our vehicles for 100K+ miles, but the deals are too good to pass up the last ones. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,Best luxury Suv, 03/07/2006,Can't go wrong with this suv,5,"I have never been more satisfied with the amount of money I paid for such luxury! I have had zero issues with this car and going on 48,000 miles."
lincoln,aviator,2003,JulesH, 03/20/2007,"Nice car, not without its little flaws.",4,"Very comfortable inside, a joy to drive, handles so well, lots of power, 3rd row seat. Very poor gas mileage. More rear seat room needed. The only problems I've had since ownership are a piece of plastic near the side back window that became partially unglued and flapped as I drove, and the steering has a squeaky feel to it when parking/driving slow in parking lots. One other thing is that in hot weather, the car often refuses to lock itself and behaves as if a door is open when it is not. I also frequently have to slam the rear gate or the vehicle light will stay on and I get a ""liftgate open"" message. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,Shady, 04/13/2007,2003 Aviator,3,"We bought this used with 24,000 miles. So far it has been pretty good. Only issues are seat climate controls that keep failing, a loose drivers seat, and a bit of corrosion on the top, inside edge of the rear liftgate (same spot as our 98 Explorer).  The brake rotors also seem like they need replacement. Control illumination is amazingly high-tech looking, but some knobs and controls don't feel smooth when operated. Overall a well built SUV with a lot of nice features. We were most impressed with the innovations, like thicker windows, that reduce noise. It has many features that make it a much improved version of the Explorer, which is what we owned previously"
lincoln,aviator,2003,jaybo, 08/22/2007,Outstanding SUV,4,"Bought this to replace a beloved Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Aviator is the best combination of performance (300 HP), and whisper quiet comfort along with great deep snow handling that I have ever owned. It was 2/3 the price of the Toyota Land Cruiser or BMW X5 (only 5 passenger) and has superior performance. It is a mystery to me why Ford replaced it with a minivanny MKX. I guess I will be forced to buy German or Japanese next time."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Sharlex, 07/03/2007,Nothing better,4,"This is the most enjoyable vehicle I have ever had the pleasure of owning. I love the luxurious interior, the beautiful exterior and flawless ride and handling. The bright cathode lights on the dash are gorgeous and it was worth every penny. I test drove many SUV's and nothing comes remotely close to the Lincoln Aviator."
lincoln,aviator,2003,rbcastle, 05/21/2003,Questioning my purchase...,3,"I purchased my car on March 1, 2003 and 
since that time I have had my vehicle 
in the service department four times.  
The most recent incident was for a 
defective power steering rack, which 
needed to be replaced.  Since this is 
such a new car, the power steering rack 
was not available and had to be 
stripped off of a new car in currently 
being built.  Took almost a whole two 
weeks to get it back, which is better 
than the 30 days they originally told 
me.

Hopefully I can overcome my thoughts 
about the car and finally begin to 
enjoy my purchase."
lincoln,aviator,2003,dot, 05/07/2008,"A few questions, but love it....",4,I got this after having a Blazer and I love it to death... It is gorgeous. It had a lot of miles when I bought it and has never been back for service. I have had some problems w/ the car saying that door is ajar and then the light stays on. Causing the battery to go dead Also the hub caps are peeling apart. Can't find replacements anywhere.
lincoln,aviator,2003,Tim, 05/14/2008,Aviator Owner's Review,4,"This has been the best vehicle I've ever owned. Its reliability is outstanding. Its power and handling is on par with the BMW-X5, and its quieter. I now have 82,000 miles on the vehicle and it runs as well as it did when I bought it. The best way to describe it is it's still tight.  No rattles. No loose parts. No electrical gremlins. At 60,000 miles I used the Aviator to tow a small car from southern Calif. to Las Vegas. I was pulling approximately 3,600lb and it didn't break a sweat. I even averaged 17 mpg. I disagree with the comment about lacking refinement compared to European SUVs. The Aviator set a new standard for affordable luxury. I paid $10K less than a similarly equipped BMW!"
lincoln,aviator,2003,Will, 10/02/2017,Beautiful Luxury,5,"We have loved our Lincoln Aviator. It has provided us with years of exquisite service. Luxurious ride and comfort, rarely needing any repair. Convenient for trekking the family, guests, on a short or long excursion or picking up groceries or an over-sized item for the house or yard.
"
lincoln,aviator,2003,Steve B, 07/09/2008,Great SUV: they should still make them,4,"The is an excellent riding & handling vehicle that Lincoln should still be manufacturing. I bought it new and have had a few mechanical problems I wouldn't have expected, like replacing the transmission after 100k miles! Overall, a great SUV."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Cory, 08/18/2008,5 years and still loving it,4,"Probably one of the best vehicles I've ever owned. I have driven this '03 for five years now with no serious problems. Has plenty of horsepower and has handled well in all weather conditions.  A few small maintenance issues such as a faulty door or lift gate sensor that has the vehicle thinking a door is open (dome light stays on) and a reverse sensor is out.  I've owned foreign vehicles that have had less maintenance visits to the dealership but none of them have matched the comfort, styling and overall driving experience.  Would like to see better gas mileage but what do you expect for an AWD SUV?     "

lincoln,aviator,2003,weeds, 01/07/2003,Nice Machine!,4,"Lincoln did a great job in designing 
and building the Aviator, which is 
a ""mini"" Navigator.  What is most 
impressive is the engine, which has 
outstanding acceleration, much better 
than any similar SUV on the market 
(U.S. or foreign made)!  The 
transmission and ride is also very 
smooth, making for a vehicle that is 
fun to drive.  In true Lincoln fashion, 
both the interior and exterior look

wish the console could be optional in 
the second row so that my passengers 
could ""pass through"" like they do in a 
mini-van and avoid the hassle of 
sliding the seat forward, and I wish 
the gear shift and 4 wheel drive

great.  Exterior design goes to the

consider an Aviator simply because they 
are accustomed to purchasing imports 
such as BMW, and Mercedes Benz are 
missing out BIGTIME!

All it takes is a comparison drive and 
the Aviator will certainly shine 
through.

ALL ASPECTS!"

lincoln,aviator,2003,Doowop, 09/14/2003,"Wow, sure glad I test drove this baby",4,"Was considering Lexus, or Infiniti, 
until I drove this. I was pleanantly 
surprised. More room than the others, 
yet handles like a sport sedan. Lots 
luxury and power and a real cruiser. 
Though premium fuel is recommended, it 
runs great on regular(87). Averaging 
just under 17 mpg all around, so I'm 
pleased considering how much power it 
has and how much fun it is to drive. I 
couldn't be happier. "
lincoln,aviator,2003,shamsin, 07/19/2003,this is a big hit,4,"this is a great car/truck, it drives 
very smoothly better than most luxury 
cars I drove, yet it is a truck with 
ample of power when you need it, the 
lighting of the dash board and steering 
wheel is my favorite. handling, 
acceleration and breaking are 
astonishing.
I have driven many luxury cars and 
trucks(MB,BMW,Lexus) this is by far on 
of the best. Lincoln has scored a big 
hit with this baby navigator, you 
should try this car before buying any 
SUV, it's worth it. get the navigation 
system for sure and may be DVD too.
Although comfortable, seats are stiff 
and have big halls in them??"
lincoln,aviator,2003,douglasbk, 08/11/2003,A true sport utility (emphasis on sport),4,"Although the gas mileage is marginal, 
I am impressed with the Aviator.  I 
have five growing children so a roomy 
third row was top priority.  I didn't 
want a huge SUV, and the smaler 
competition had much less legroom.  
The interior look and the Aviator's 
ride quality is certainly one of the 
best of all the competition.  It truly 
feels like a luxury sports car and 
handles so well I am left wondering 
how they pulled it off. The design is 
beautiful, the V8 quick, and when I 
plant the pedal to the metal it sounds 
just like a Mustang Mach 1."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Patty, 08/21/2003,Love The Aviator,4,"After owning 3 Explorers (two xlts and 
one Eddie Bauer) I am really impressed 
with this truck. This is my first 
Lincoln and I truly doubt I will ever 
own anything else. I havent had the 
chance to test it out in New England 
winters yet but Im sure it wont let me 
down."
lincoln,aviator,2003,NaXXX, 08/13/2003,Very Satisfied,4,"This vehicle was purchased for my 
wife.  She loves the car and I know 
that she is safe in it.  It is spacious 
even at the third row.  Design is 
gorgeous.  Only drawback is the fuel 
economy due to weight but I can live 
with it."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Grand Mom , 09/03/2003,My new baby,4,"One great SUV, recently purchased as my 
50th Birthday present. This is my 3rd 
Lincoln, I own a 2000 Towncar and had a 
1992 TownCar.  I wanted a SUV and my 
husband said it had to be a Lincoln and 
the Aviator is right on time.  My 
grandaughter is 4 years old and she 
travel with me all the time and the DVD

really loves it.  It rides smoothly and 
handles very well."

the best. This car literally flies and 
can beat almost any other SUV on the 
road. Interior is beautiful as is the 
exterior. Ride is real good. 
Supposedly engineers created this auto 
with a plane in mind, thus the name 
Aviator and when you start it up and 
the light go on, you feel like your at 
the control panel of your own 747."

XC90, and Aviator.  Aviator agreed by 
ALL family menbers within seconds.  
Bought right after test drive.  Can't

you driven a Lincoln SUV lately?"
lincoln,aviator,2003,Marzie, 10/06/2003,Soooo Happy!,4,"We are so happy we finally found the 
perfect SUV.  We have test driven almost 
everything out there.  Nothing compared 
to the sports car like feel when you 
drive it.  We did not get the navigation

although it is not quite as big, it is 
still very comfortable for my family 
of four. The power is unbelievable.  "

aviator....not that far off from the 
porsche. In summary i'm gettting a kick

You get  alot of truck for the money. I 
also don't really worry about the black 
beast like i did w/ the porsche.However 
I do miss the stares, questions and

lincoln,aviator,2003,womenofgod, 10/26/2003,About My Lincoln,4,"It is the first Lincoln I have ever 
owned. This SUV rides like a limo and 
doesn't even seem like a truck."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Burns, 03/27/2005,Absolutely Love It,4,"This is my work vehicle, my office if you will, but the wife and I end up in it over the weekends even though we have an Acura MDX. The Aviator is much more comfortable, smoother, less noise, and is all around more fun to drive. 52,000 miles and smiles. I hate that Lincoln will soon change it. Oh well, I'll have to get the last 2005!"
lincoln,aviator,2003,EDF, 10/29/2003,Not so thrilled,2,"I'm 50/50 on the Aviator.   However, 
the brushed silver console scartches so 
easy and if you 
buy this vehicle to truck kids around, 
it get's scratched up quickly.  If you 
use all three rows, forget putting 
anything in the back.  I can barely fit 
an umbrella stroller.  Lastly, I never 
had a V8, and didn't realize how much 
gas it eats up.  If I 
had to do it again, I would go with a 
Volvo or Acura SUV.  I told the dealer 
I wasn't happy with my choice and he 
basically said tough.  "
lincoln,aviator,2003,AV8Rcag, 03/02/2003,There is a GOD...,4,"...he revealed the Ten Commandments to 
Moses.  Now he's given heaven's blue 
prints to Lincoln. They've really done 
it up right.  The Aviator is typical 
Lincoln CLASS. The ride is superb 
(what'd ya expect for a Lincoln), but 
the clincher is the power and 
handling.  This baby is a rocketsled. 
It will blow my wife's fuel injected 
Tahoe OFF THE ROAD.  Though it rides 
like a Lincoln it handles like a sports 
car.  The interior is sooooo classy.  
Almost felt like putting on a tuxedo."
lincoln,aviator,2003,Kathy's Car, 11/02/2003,Refreshing!,4,"After much hesitation I made the move 
to a  SUV.  The Aviator convinced me. 
My criteria was it couldn't ride or 
feel like a truck.  It definitely does 
not.  The handling, performance and 
ride are more than I expected.  Coming 
out of a Mercedes C320, I was 
concerned to move to a larger vehicle, 
but the experience so far has me less 
frustrated with my sometimes 1 hour 
commute in bumper to bumper traffic.  
After a very disappointing ride with 
Mercedes, I am truly excited and 
refreshed to be back to an impressive 
American made vehicle.    "

This vehicle is impressive.
Agile for this size: no problems 
parking in any parking lot or street. 
Road trips with family and ""stuff"" are 
very comfortable:acceleration/passing 
no problem, even fully loaded with a/c 
on.I would buy another one of 
these.The Aviator's positive journal

Navigator, Sequouia and Tahoe, all 
with the decked out packages.  The 
Aviator was a hands down winner.   

Quieter, more luxurious and more 
powerful (responsive to the quick 
spurts of acceleration).  AND, the 
steering is awesome, European 
comporable for sure.

Expensive on the gas but we only put 
12k per year on our vehicle.  For 
that, the luxury ride is unbeatable.  
There is no other vehicle for this 
price and this total package."

The 300+ horse 32 Valve American made

is some slight road noise inside the

lincoln,aviator,2003,Scott Davis, 10/20/2004,Love my Aviator!,4,"I had no intention of buying this model 
when I walked in.  That day I was only 
going to ""look"" at a few different 
models.  

When I drove the Aviator, I was 
amazed.  The drive was like a caddy, 
with a comanding view of the road, and 
power to spare.  The interrior was 
imacualte, and the sound system was a 
bonus.  I was hooked.

Since then I have enjoyed the car SO 
much.  My two-year old son, LOVES the 
DVD, and it is a joy to travel in.  The 
gas milage is the only draw back, but I 
knew that going in.  With 300+ HP at 
your disposal it's hard to 
complain... ;)

I'd give it a 10 out of ten if not for 
the gas milage.  So a 9 out of 10 in 
overall satisfaction.  LOVE IT."

more power than you need, like that is 
a bad thing?  It's so much fun to drive

In general the engine pings and the check engine light comes and off and when we come to a stop light, the AC starts blowing hot air. The check engine light came steady on at 78K miles and when I took it to the dealer, it was diagnosed that left side cylinder head and transmission needs to be replaced and there is no warranty and I was given an estimation of $5500 for the cylinder head and $3500 for transmission.

When I bought it I was impressed with the styling more then anything else, but that quickly faded when the mechanical problems started soon after. I kept up on all required maintenance since I bought it.  The problems started early on.  From the climate control to the spark plug coils going out on me continuously.  The gear shift leaver broke when I was putting it into park from drive.  On the back tail gate there is a crack right below the back widow.  I was told that it is a trend on these vehicles.

lincoln,aviator,2004,Ray, 04/12/2010,Excellent,4,When i first saw this vehicle i liked it right off the bat. The amazing exterior design of this SUV caught my eye in an instant. I drive this car every day and it never fails to impress me. The 302 horsepower really gives you power and makes you feel like you are driving a sports car. With this SUV you get the best of both worlds. You get the features of a luxury SUV and the features of a sports car with its amazing handling. Very good buy. I definitely recommend it.

Also, my extended warranty just expired.  Now car is at dealer with oil leak and thermostat problem. In the past had to have transmission repaired, the driving gear fixed.  Air conditioner problems.  Not happy right now.  Third row is useless.  Small space.  Also when third row up, now trunk space.  Have 3 kids so it's a problem, because not roomy."
lincoln,aviator,2004,brandon, 02/04/2006,Flying the Aviator,4,"i love driving this suv.  i actually enjoy driving to work now because the aviator is such a joy to drive.  the stereo is fantastic, and the ride is so smooth that is feels like you are flying.  the steering is easy and smooth as well.  the HID lights are a big plus at night as well.  the aviator is loaded with all kinds of gadgits and i love gadgits.  over all, i love the vehicle.  it has a few problems, but since most of the aviators are discounted right now, you can get a brand new one for 20,000 less than a bmw or mb."

The interior is flawless, the engine is quiet but powerful. The controls are all within distance. I truely believe mpg is more reflective on the driver rather then the vehicle. My wife and I get 17.5 MPG average! We recently learned that driving within a certain speed helps MPG(read the manual) So I dont think the MPG too bad, just try not to be tempted by that 300hp engine. Exterior is decent, looks a bit better then the Mercury or the Explorer. I expected us to buy a Mountaineer, glad I didn't!   "

I really wanted a Lincoln Navigator and when I went on the lot and saw the Aviator, I thought I was getting a deal. My warranty ended last year, 4 years came first and 56,000 miles at this point and I have a burnt valve inside the head. $3,000 is the estimated price quote to repair this problem. I have had nice luxury cars all my life and this is my first and last Lincoln. I am so disappointed. I have a 1995 Nissan Maxima with 160,000 miles no problem, I have had a Honda with 200,000 miles and no problems. My first car was a Hyundai and I had a 100,000 + miles and no problems.

The exterior and interior design is 
simply superb.  With few exceptions, 
the fit and finish of both the interior 
and exterior are on par with the best 
that the Japanese and Germans have to 
offer.  The problem with the Aviator is 
that most people willing to spend 40k

that goes along with a Japanese or 
Gernman moniker.  That is too bad,

months ago, our Inifinit G35 (which we 
loved) just wasn't cutting it in space 
department. My wife has always loved 
sports cars and was aghast at the idea 
of a Mini Van, so it had to be an SUV 
with as she says ""a lot of bells and 
whistles"". We drove all of the imports 
and domestics and found this to be the 
best for the money. Virtually all 
other vehicles had much more of a 
truck ride (including the imports 
suprisingly) while the independent 
rear suspension of the Aviator really 
makes for a solid ride. I race cars 
for fun and if there was an SUV racing

pulled a trailer with no effort, ride

other vehicles test driven. Handling

SUV's I have owned. The engine is 
strong and smooth. Plus you an interior

is somewhat limited, could be a 
uncomfortable for large or obese 
people.  Stereo is excellent

one automatic window, exterior mirrors

Never really liked it but it was in our price range and had all the amenitied that we required.
We owned a Chevy Tahoe prior to this but it did not have a 3rd row seat which is what we needed.
Here are the things that I dispise about this car.

1. Even though we have owned this vehicle for over a year still can't get used to the window controls in the center console and the seat controls on the door
2. Even though we've owned this vehicle for over a year still haven't gotten used the fact that is doesn't automatically unlock all the doors when you turn it off, I curse this vehicle everyday for this very reason!!!!!!!!!!!"

It whistles at speeds over 60 MPH.  This

door jams against the front door.

put money down on Volvo XC90 (HUGE

2nd row seats don't slide forward 
enough causing our 5 yr old to wipe on 
undersized, poorly placed running

lincoln,aviator,2004,chiengrand, 09/19/2003,American Prince?,4,"I wanted luxury, 260+ HP, a head-
turning design, 3 rows of seats, decent 
MPG, tight ride and handling package, 
and American! 



What won me over was the ride! The 
combination of power,handling, and 
comfort was superior to the rest; the 
looks - an added plus - a bold, clean 
and sturdy look with no wasted curves 
and frills, and the best grille on the 
road! Very American!

So I am a very happy driver with a 
slightly guilty conscience about the 
MPG, but I have gotten 18 on the 
highway, and 14 in city traffic. I 
traded in a Dodge Dakota Quad Cab that 
had worse MPG, so I keep telling myself 
that I'm part of the solution!!"
lincoln,aviator,2004,Rod S., 09/19/2003,Hats off to Lincoln,4,"I had examined and researched this 
vehicle prior to purchase.  In the past 
four months I have had nothing but 
satisfaction and pleasure in driving 
this vehicle.  It is as comfortable as 
a luxury sedan, pull my boat with ease, 
and is an overall pleasure to own.  
Lincoln has excelled in creating a new 
model that has all of the features of 
its bigger brother, the Navigator, 
without the overpowering size."
lincoln,aviator,2004,Pink Lady, 09/19/2003,Love My Aviator,5,"I looked at all SUV's of every make and 
model before deciding on the Lincoln 
Aviator. I am extremely happy that I 
chose it. Not only is it fun to drive 
with many outstanding features, but 
other people on the road admire it as 
well. I was on a road trip with it and 
stopped at a dinner along the 
Interstate one day. When I came out, 
there were other people surrounding my 
vehicle and checking it out. When they 
realized that is was mine, they started 
asking me all kinds of questions about 
it. They climbed into their brand new 
supped up pickup truck while still 
staring at my SUV. It was a compliment."
lincoln,aviator,2004,backwards, 09/24/2003,I could have done better!,3,"Interior less user friendly than 
earlier models. Dome lights don't shine 
where you need them to.  Analog clock, 
now really...it could at least be 
readable. Flimsy console.  Clumsy info 
center.  Armrests gone! These are only 
the things that distract you from 
driving.  Overall I think I could have 
presented a better design inside and 
outside.  They took more steps 
backwards than they took forward."

stability, handling, and acceleration 
are excellent.  The internal ""creature

climate controls, excellent radi/CD, 
DVD player, cool or warm seat controls

was way too big for me.  After test 
driving the Aviator, I knew this was 
the car for me.  It is extremely 
comfortable, plenty of leg room and 
everything on the dashboard is in 
reach.  I can fit my son's friends in 
comfort while they watch a DVD or 
listen to music.  The ride is very 
smooth.  A++"

had an SUV for a vehicle.  The
grandchildren love it, her co-workers
love it, and her sidekick (grandpa)
loves it.  The Aviator makes her want to
take a trip but so far it has been used
primarily for traveling to work. 
However, lunches with the gals from the
office allow her to show off her new
wheels.  But the best is having the
grandchildren with her and going to
places to eat and the movies.  Yep, she
loves it best of all."

lincoln,aviator,2004,Shriner214, 10/14/2003,The top of the line in SUV'S.,5,"We tried the BMW, Denali, Yukon and 
Volvo before settling with our Aviator. 
The BMW and Volvo were just too small 
for traveling plus rear 
seat room for persons my size (6'2"" 
240lbs) was really uncomfortable. The 
ride wasn't acceptable. The 
Yukon & Denali were a close 2nd. The 
mileage was very 
acceptable for this vehicle. 
On a trip to Maine from 
Florida (5100 miles) average 
mileage of 22.8 per gallon. Air was 
increased in the tires however to 34 
Lbs. to achieve as a dealer Friend 
had advised. City driving averages 17.5-
19.0 depending on how much is stop & go."
lincoln,aviator,2004,WINTERS, 10/17/2003,ENGINE TROUBLE ALREADY,3,"I have owned my Aviator for nearly six 
months and have taken it to the shop 
four times. When I bought it there was 
black glue on the headliner, it was 
replaced but now I am stuck with 
fingerprints all over it. The 
rainguards were installed improperly, 
they replaced them now they are falling 
off again.  Now the vehicle is in the 
shop because it overheated to the point 
that I couldn't drive it and I was 
stranded by the side of the highway.  
For the price that I paid for the 
vehicle none of these problems should 
have happened in the first six months 
of ownership.  Very unhappy."

however the inside space is compromised 
a bit. The seats are luxurious as long 
as you are not very large in the 
derrier. Car performance is excellent - 
the AWD gets over any snowy or icy 
conditions. Not much space for hauling 
cargo even with the 3 row seat folded

Lincoln is a big step upward.  This is 
surely the pinnacle of American SUV

cars for years, but this unit has

the 2000 Town car we traded for this 
SUV.  We haven't taken any trips yet,

seems to have a fundamental design flaw 
in the climate control that allows 
frigid air to flow from the side window 
demisters. Temperature difference from 
demisters to floor exceeds 60 degrees, 
causing the vehicle to be unable to 
control thermal comfort for the 
passengers and driver. Really a shame

respects. Factory denies the issue, but 
it has been verified as a problem in 
cold climates on all 2004 vehicles

too small or have design issues. We

Volvo for these reasons. Will fit 8

lincoln,aviator,2004,GAIL POWERS, 05/13/2004,A Lemon With Hubcaps,2,"My beef is not with the vehicle, but 
with Lincoln itself.  Their customer 
service is deplorable.  I paid $2,000 
for an upgrade with Navigational 
System.  The Navigational system is 
extremely poor and inaccurate.  My 
husband's portable Garmin works 
better.  I called for a new disc to 
see if the new one was improved.  
Customer Service said they are not 
responsible for it because they bought 
it from another company.  If I want a 
new one I can call this company and 
get one for $169.  They didn't mind 
taking my money the first time, but 
don't call them with a complaint.  My 
Durango was a better value overall and 
far more comfortable."

pleasantly surprised by the high level 
of quality in both build and service. 
My fuel economy, while dismal in the

the 6 cyl Volvo on the highway (19.2 
vs. 23 with the Volvo) I have gone from 
hood badge to tailgate badge, tires to 
roof rack both inside and out looking 
for assembly defects and could not find 
a significant one. It looks nice, it 
drives nice and I would heartily

liked it immediately. Two main features

It's the 2005, when I bought it in 2005 I knew the gas mileage was crap, but found the truck solid and full of power. I had the Grand Cherokee which was great too but the Aviator smoked it as far as performance. I have 75,000 miles on it. I do my oil changes every 3-4000 miles. I put tires on it in 2009 and I just put them on again..I never had them rotated and I failed on checking the pressure so they didn't get the wear they should of. I just got new ball joints as they were shot. That is all I've had to put it in it. It's never been to the shop for anything but oil changes and the ball joint issue. Rear door panal cracked too."
lincoln,aviator,2005,Chuck, 03/15/2010,Great All Around SUV,4,"We could not be happier with our Aviator. We are the original owners and have had little trouble since our purchase. I wanted a luxury AWD SUV to last us 8-10 years. Well we are half way there and still love it. The fuel mileage is pitiful but we were aware of that at time of purchase. That's what you get when you put a Mustang engine in a heavy SUV. Duh? The AWD and Traction Control are excellent. I feel that my wife is safe in a heavy, well built American SUV. The comfort and ride is totally ""Lincoln."" The THX sound system is fantastic too. I just put new tires and brakes on. Also updated the Navigation DVD and purchased the extended warranty through Ford. We're keeping it!"
lincoln,aviator,2005,jd1017, 04/26/2007,Awesome SUV! I love this car!,4,"I've read a lot of the comments concerning the 2003 AWD Aviator and feel very fortunate. I haven't experienced anything but pleasure from this SUV, the power and comfort is second to none. I'm in sales and stop start this car ten plus times a day, no troubles. The rear hatch surrounding the glass did split, fiberglass fracture is what the dealship referred to it as. They replaced it, out of warranty, free of charge. So far with over 50,000 miles on the vehicle I really can't complain about anything! I still think this is the best bang for the buck!"
lincoln,aviator,2005,Ricverde, 12/15/2004,Last Car,4,"I'm getting on in years so this will 
probably be my last car purchased.  I 
absolutely love the vehicle!  The ride 
is smooth, visibility great, and 
handling precise.  The gas mileage 
isn't too hot, but I knew it wouldn't 
be before I bought the Aviator. The 
black beauty has drawn admiring looks 
and positive comments from passers-by 
in parking lots, which sure helps me 
feel good about spending the money for 
a vehicle I probably really didn't 
need. "
lincoln,aviator,2005,Dave, 10/27/2005,It Could be Better,3,"I've put 14,000 miles on my Aviator and it has run well except for a few problems.  The steering shudders badly while making left turns at low speeds on level ground. Dealer says pretty much ""they'll do that"". Says its caused by power steering sucking air while turning on incline. Been to the shop twice and it improved the first time for a month, then came back. DVD player ate DVD within first 3 months. Parts had to be back ordered. They never have a Lincoln for you to use when your is in the shop. I did get 19.5 mpg on a 1300 mile trip averaging 75 MPH."

lincoln,aviator,2005,April, 11/15/2005,LUV this SUV!,4,"I own the 2003 Aviator, and am quite satisfied with it. The one drawback, as anyone may guess, is the fuel economy. This vehicle is fun to drive, is very comfortable, and attracts a lot of attention as the ""baby Navigator"". Dealer service is great, as the 2003 model came with an excellent warranty package. One of my favorite features of this vehicle is the steering wheel- mounted controls for the audio system, A/C, etc. I also like the second-row captain's chairs with the roomy console. The Aviator has a generous cargo capacity with the third-row seats folded flat into the floor. The V8 engine is very powerful, which a former 4-cylinder driver like myself has to ge accustomed to."
lincoln,aviator,2005,Mandi Rinard, 01/28/2006,This is luxury???,2,This car has been a lot of trouble. Every time I start to like it again something else breaks. We have had problems with the windows rolling down half the time they don't work; neither does the radio or the keyless entry. We have had the gear shift replaced. The car is very noisy on the road. Seatbelt housing makes a lot of noise and back window squeaks all the time!!! The blower fan on the AC had to be replaced and the heated and AC seats quit working. The panel on the rear window cracked too. For the most part I would like to run this car into a wall most of the time. 
lincoln,aviator,2005,Scott, 09/26/2008,Absolutely wonderful!,4,"I have only had the car for a few days now, but I am sorry that I didn't purchase it sooner. I already had an SUV and wanted to get something newer with less mileage. I can honestly say that I think I made the perfect choice. It is extremely comfortable, the V8 has more power than a lot of sports cars and SUVs, and to beat all, you can't beat the value!!!  I echo the sentiments of another reviewer - it should have never been taken off the market. My suggestion: if you are looking for an SUV for comfort, reliability, and ultimate luxury, look no further than the Lincoln Aviator!"
lincoln,aviator,2005,VJM, 07/23/2010,Nice vehicle,4,"I replaced my Lexus with an Aviator 3 years ago. It only had 10K miles on it. Besides general mte. have replaced rear brakes and tires. Rear window panel cracked 2 yrs ago and was replaced under warranty.  Has now cracked again (not under warranty).  Dealership told me that Lincoln was aware of this problem but was not helping with replacement anymore.  Was told yesterday (at 56K miles) that water pump was leaking. My husband likes this vehicle better than I do. But I drive it 95% of this time.  I consistently get 17 mpg on a combo of city/highway driving.  When my husband drives it the mpg goes down because he has a lead foot and loves ""floor it"" after a stop."
lincoln,aviator,2005,jack, 07/13/2005,05 Aviator,4,"This truck has exceptional power and torque for an SUV.  It's very comfortable, with ride, steering and handling that is much improved over the Explorer.  It steering feel is light, and not truck-like, but more like the Jaguar X-Type we previously owned.  The vehicle has a strong down-the-road presense, especially from front 3/4 views."
lincoln,aviator,2005,hatethiscar1, 07/02/2010,An expensive pinto,1,"The Lincoln aviator is the worst car ever built. They are dangerous and fall apart after 60,000 miles.

Only way to go was down into ravine between east and west lanes to avoid accident.  My husband steered the Aviator down into ravine and after 100 feet we rode out and back up onto the highway, NEVER sliding or spinning out of control.  This car has saved our family. The handling in all types of weather has been wonderful. Cons: Very restricted seating-leg room, etc; poor gas mileage; cheap interior materials: leather poor quality, fake wood. Have owned many expensive vehicles, can't understand why Lincoln skimped on these. Front seat backs need to be powered. Heating vent burns legs"
lincoln,aviator,2005,John Stevens, 10/12/2005,Sunroof Leak in new Aviator,3,"within the first week of ownership, our brand new 2005 Lincoln Aviator has a water leak from the sunroof which is dripping down through the overhead driver light switch. The dealer had the car overnight and didn't fix the problem. Ford technical support stated some Mountaineers and Aviators are having the same problem. This is a $50,000 luxury vehicle. No wonder the Aviator is in its last year of the current design and will emerge in the fall of 2006 as a downsized model. What do we do in the meantime? Our Aviator only has 282 miles on it and it's going back to the shop for the same problem."

Sometimes it would start when you got in it and every time i would take it to the lincoln dealership they would keep saying they could do nothing because when i would get it to the dealership it would start up so i got tired of it maybe starting and sometimes not starting that i ended up getting it towed back to the dealership because one day i got in it and it wouldn't start so i ended up buying a new starter and that ended up not even being the problem it was something else so i was frustrated with that.

The most recent being a steering wheel vibration/pulsation that occurs when turning the wheel to full lock when parking.  We've been given a host of excuses over the 3 service visits on this issue, the latest being that it's a ""design feature"" and we have to live with it.  To date, we've had the transmission control module replaced, since the one it was originally shipped with was for the Ford Explorer and as a result, we were unable to put our AWD system into a full-time locked mode until it got replaced. Entire NAV system replaced. Too much trouble. Never again"
lincoln,aviator,2005,ctaylor, 04/12/2005,In the shop again,2,"I bought my aviator less than a year ago and have had to take it in for repairs several times.  The rear end went out at 1000 miles and it took a month to fix.  Dealer said they are having problems with this on alot of others too.  Then it was the transmission, stereo, and brakes. Good thing it has a great warranty.  It is a nice car otherwise, but I would enjoy it alot more if it were more dependable."
lincoln,aviator,2005,J. Davis, 04/13/2005,"Baby Nav, but better....",4,"My wife LOVES this vehicle.  I really like it as well.  Power to spare, kicks down when you really need it. Almost as much seating room as our friends Navigator, but handles and drives much smaller than the Nav.

lincoln,aviator,2005,Frank, 05/12/2005,Great car,4,"I have owned 2 limited Explorer's and thought this car would ride the same. Was I wrong. This rides better than My Lincoln Continental that I had. I test drove the new 2006 Benz Ml-350 and BMW X5. I found that The Aviator gave me a better more quite and comfortable ride with alot more room and many more toys that the others cars did not offer. The Elite Package is the way to go with this car, You will love the Navagation and DVD as well as the 300 watt Voice command Stereo and AC/heated seats. Gas wise it stinks but it will save you on insurance, besides if you can afford this car, gas should not be a concern. The ride is like a Luxury car should be. Test drive it and you will agree."

I bought it used with 20,000 miles on it and have had no problems except for the brakes.  I may not keep it as long as I expected but that remains to be seen. By the way, the gas mileage improves significantly on the highway. "
lincoln,aviator,2005,Scott , 01/08/2006,This is the ultimate driving machine,5,You may have higher engine noise slightly but you expect that when all its competitors have v6 and you're driving a 300 horsepower v8 that's what you get with power.

with my Aviator. For an SUV it handles 
like a sports car around curves, feels 
solid and planted to the road. Smooth 
on most road surfaces with little wind 
or engine noise. The interior design is 
one of the best for SUV's. Like all the 
safety features it provides like the 
rear park assist, the turn signal

Yes, gas mile is poor but if you can afford the vehicle you can afford the gas. Looks good, rides good, sounds good, This is my 1st SUV and 1st american made purchase since 1994. (Im a Lexus man but this aviator is tranforming me in to a Lincoln-SUV man). I am shock that the Aviator does not get better reviews. I did a lot of research and the Aviator is the best in appearance and power and it not just a jacked up station wagon like many of the other Mid-size so call SUV.    "
lincoln,aviator,2005,STEVE, 03/10/2005,My Aviator runs like crap,2,"I traded in a Mercury Mountaineer that was a very nice vehicle for this one.  At ll,500 miles, it sits at a traffic light and shakes.  I've had it in a total for 3 times and been told each time that it was to ""specs"".  I've had plenty of cars... around 50 or so... and never had a $45,000 lincoln that sits at a light and shakes.  My water bottle looks like a Tsunami.  I'm trying very hard to find a real mechanic as opposed to a technician to try and fix this car.  I'm going to sell it ASAP...as I can get it fixed.  Any person driving this vehicle would ask what's wrong with it.... My 6th and LAST Lincoln/Mercury product and probably my last American Made Auto.Steve Crouch"

If you want to feel like you are in a Luxury car and not a truck well then this is the one for you. My sister owned one and we fell in love. we did our research and realized this was the one. Not only do you feel safe, but it handles the road amazingly. It looks good to! heads turn when you are driving this machine. Safety features are all there too. we only regret not buying it sooner."
lincoln,aviator,2005,Steven Wilson, 03/21/2005,Warning! Cheap car alert!,3,"My old Aviator died after 94,000 miles.  This Aviator is reliable so far but it is very cheap.  The fake wood is terrible and the seats have no back support.  The whole car is very cheap.  You could tell that the Chevy Tahoe is safer and built better and has a smoother ride.  This car rides better then a Chrysler but not as well as a Toyota, GMC, or Honda.  This car is too powerful.  It only gets 15 miles per gallon.  This car is a horrible value and cheap.  "
lincoln,aviator,2005,Eric, 04/07/2005,Surprised,4,I have been one to always buy sports cars but with the pending arrival of my son i thought it would be more practical to look at an SUV.  I love my Aviator. I got the Jet Black loaded one and love it. Highly recommed it.  Only downside is the gas mileage.  So far i am averaging 12 mpg in the city.  hope it gets better.  My navigator gets 13 to 14.
lincoln,aviator,2005,driver, 04/26/2005,14-18 mpg is honest,4,"The 2005 Lincoln Aviator is easy to drive and they have thought of almost every amenity to make driving comfortable from heated/cooled seats and zoned climate controls to all radio and cruise contols on the steering wheel. The sensors in the rear bumper are a plus for me since this is the first non sedan type for me. I haven't owned it long enough to have an opinion about the build quality or reliabilty. My average is 15 mpg and I have driven 3,000 miles (1/2 city and 1/2 highway). Lincoln indicates 14-18 mpg which is true. I make trips to the airport often and it has plenty of room for 4 engineers and their gear plus me the driver.  "
lincoln,aviator,2005,new mexico, 06/19/2005,Near perfect,4,"I have found the Aviator to be near perfect.  It handles well- it simply responds beautifully.  It is comfortable for me and I am rather small ( 5'3"" ) and yet my 6' husband finds it comfortable as well. It is a great size- large enough but, not too large.  And, when I need power- it is there. Overall, so far so good- I really like this SUV."
lincoln,aviator,2005,Ricardo, 07/14/2005,I love my Aviator,4,"The Aviator performs exactly as I thought it would.  It's a pleasure to drive, and my wife and I look forward to trips in it.  The mileage isn't red hot, but I knew it wouldn't be when I decided to buy the vehicle.  It's great for hauling groceries, golf clubs, and friends.  We love it!"

The Aviator's cabin impressed me far more than any competitor's.  The suspension and ride are excellent for an SUV, and the performance, while by no means insufficient, is the car's only weakness.  I have had no issues of reliability, and Lincoln's service has been top notch.  "

Always had very good luck with each of them. 100000+ miles on each. I keep my vehicles at least 8-10 years. Take excellent care of them. Have never had a complaint about any. When I retired, I decided to upgrade into a ""luxury vehicle"". Have never had such a vehicle in my life. Thought I owed it to myself. When the Aviator came out in 2003 I was impressed. I purchased a ""DEMO"" with 1411 miles on it. I was thrilled to death. Immediately I had ignition problems. Not once. not twice, but five times. The same problem. It was solved eventually, but only after being towed and inconvienced five times.    "

Like the interior and the ride, but have been very disappointed with the number of problems we have had. Currently experiencing problems with the A/C which blows foul smelling humid air at us.  Service rep says this is due to condensation sitting in the compressor creating mildew and is normal.  Technicians repeatedly claim they can't detect a foul odor.  Have recently met another 03 Aviator owner with the same beef.  Wonder what kind of health hazard might be posed by mould or mildew in the air system. Anyone else with this problem?  We are taking it to the regional level with the dealer.  Will post our results"
lincoln,aviator,2005,CB, 09/21/2005,Great value in a luxury midsize SUV,4,"I'm very pleased with my new '05 Aviator so far. The handling and driving performance are excellent, comparable to my previous SUV (2002 Lexus RX300), and that's saying a lot. Very plush, feature-laden interior with excellent use of space. Logical instrument layout. Overall looks are great--definitely like taking all the best things about a Navigator and shrinking it down slightly to a more manageable level, while still having an ample 3rd row for families with kids. Employee pricing and other incentives make this a hard deal to beat in this segment! If you're looking for a luxury SUV with a 3rd row, you'd be hard pressed to find a better combo of value, styling and performance.  "
lincoln,aviator,2005,nvbanker, 10/02/2005,Nice Driver,4,The Aviator has the distinction of being the Navigator's younger brother in design and looks.  Most of the features you can get in the Navigator are available.  The magic of the Aviator is the way it drives.  The steering is easy and the power is extraordinary.  It's the most fun SUV I've ever driven.  
lincoln,aviator,2005,Deann, 11/15/2005,I Love This Car,4,We have had it for almost a year now and its ran great. We had a problem with the steering wheel locking up. The car itself is very comfortable but the leather gets dirty very easily. We have had Lincolns for 13 years and they take care and own up on their warranties. We would have gotten the Navigator but it was just to big for us. Overall this car is the best Lincoln we've had.
lincoln,aviator,2005,CHRISTIE, 12/18/2005,Awesome,4,"AS this being my first SUV purchace and may i say a forced purchace (I am a real sporty performance driven girl myself) As a new mother and needing more room I opted for the aviator for not only its looks inside and out, the roomiiness and luxury sold me ... not only that 3rd row seating.... The V8 still got out of its own way...unlike its suv look alikes ( which by the way had no more room than my A6 Audi in the back) still love it one year later, It is my new livingroom.  Clee"

lincoln,continental,2000,eric, 02/24/2016,1998 Continental,5,"I bought this cream put for the tiny sum of 1600 bucks. it had 130k miles. i took her for an hour test drive and just couldn't find any reason not to buy. i had her for 2 or 3 years and sold her for 1200 bucks to some lucky stiff.
first off, the paint and leather are top quality. the v8 was fast for this type of car. if i wasn't careful i was doing 95 on the highway. all i can say is that i had no major repairs at all and she was like driving your living room couch. nice. the gas mileage was great for such a big car as i normally got 27 mpg on the highway and i was doing 80. Now, there are some lil issues to watch out for:
DOOR AJAR code - this can be fixed by spraying air into the rear door latches. it works for a month or two and then you had to spray again. a minor inconvenience. i kept my spray bottle under the seat.
BATTREY -  strange, but if your battery is nearing its life on this car, weird things happen. for me i got a steering fault. i desalt with it for a while because the car started fine. i read about this online and someone said that old batteries do not mix well. the next day i bought a new battery and i never had the issue again. 
AIR SUSPENSION - every morning the rear would sit low. it would pump up fine though and work all day. i bought a bag online for i think like 80 bucks as i suspected one bag of being leaky. ill tell you what, i couldn't believe how easy it was to swap. no joke, i just jacked her up popped the old one out with a ratchet and new one in. it was a 25 minute job. i really couldn't believe it. 
I have to say, for the money you can't go wrong. such a nice ride and safe too. i see em all the time from 98-02 with 70-120k miles for 2-3k. you just can't beat the value.

Have put over 15k on it so far and have had no mechanical problems other than one instance of a mysterious loss of power. Despite this hiccup, the only problems I've had so far are cosmetic damage associated with having a 10+ year old car. My only complaints would be poor fuel economy and turning dynamics. It's a big car with a big engine, so I expect to pay a lot for gas though. Due to it's size, it doesn't take turns well. Your rear passengers may go for a ride if you take them too sharply.

Overall, it's been a great car and I've enjoyed owning it."

Only Lincoln drivers know what I'm talking about. The steering wheel mounted controls for HVAC fan speed, temp, radio and cruise..all the things you need to keep any button pushing techy stoned with amazement and awe for years.

2 kids so I needed a sedan anyway.  The 
Continental is a fun drive for a

good and it is a comfortable ride for

lincoln,continental,2001,gittingjr, 09/13/2010,Best Car I Have Ever Driven,5,"I currently drive a 2001 Lincoln Continental, and I plan to own the car until it dies.  It is such a reliable vehicle that also has a great level of performance.  Despite the fact that it is a Lincoln, I compare it to a Cadillac because the Cadillacs were always known for their performance while Lincolns were known mostly for their comfort level.  This is a great vehicle for people of all ages, but unlike its counterpart Town Car, the Continental appeals a lot more to a younger man like me due to its torque and smaller size. Discontinuing this model was one of the worst mistakes Ford ever made.  The car got better as the years went on. Imagine what a 2010 Lincoln Continental would look like."
lincoln,continental,2001,superjohn, 04/09/2005,2001 Lincoln Continental,5,very nice car a true top of the line American Sedan.  Lots of power and its smooth.

lincoln,continental,2001,Firefighter, 12/08/2019,Absolutely amazing...,5,"we have a 2001 Lincoln Continental. It currently has 321,000 miles on it. We have replaced the obvious maintenance parts that every vehicle will need replaced. Brakes, tie rod ends, sensors...general items. We have owned 2 different lincolns and they always seem to have a issue with the Air Ride system. The last one we replaced the air bags with shocks, cheap and easy fix. This one we really have not had to do anything to it. It has the Air light on, and we have ordered new air bags to go under it. They too are a easy replace. All in all this car is absolutely the most amazing car. People look at me different when I pull up to the Fire house with it...but when I tell them I have over 300k on it and the transmission and motor have never had to be worked on...they quiet up. This car has traveled to see family 13 hours away several times, the seats are amazingly comfortable. I am currently trying to find another vehicle and there are not hardly any vehicles that can compete with what I have. Just really sucks because I know it will not last forever...just not sure if I can find a suitable replacement too. Lincoln did it right when they made this car.

lincoln,continental,2001,Dr. Detroit, 12/14/2004,Hot Rod Lincoln,5,"I bought this black over grey fully loaded Continental after driving a Park Avenue Ultra, Cadilac Seville, and Chrysler 300.  This car was just plain faster and handled better.  It'll run rock solid at 80 mph and still get 25 mpg.  The user adjustable air-suspension and steering are valuable because you can get very good ride control.  It won't float, bounce, or lean at speed.  The engine is red-lined at 6,500 rpm and it'll run that fast.  Low-end torque, say below 1,500 to 1,800 rpm, is somewhat slight; so, if you are used to a standard normal V8 then you're gonna have to goose it a bit more than usual off the line.  But, after that just hold on. "
lincoln,continental,2001,Jimbo, 09/29/2007,2001 Lincoln Continental,4,"Purchased this vehicle as a ""sometime"" driver; have a company car to drive to work, and an old minivan for hauling stuff. So the Lincoln is used to go out with the wife, visit kids at college, or travel. I did not believe reviews I had read about this car's gas mileage, but I am getting around 24 mpg combined. This car effortlessly flies down the highway, and is like driving a leather recliner. The trunk is massive for suitcases, etc.  I cannot believe that Lincoln stopped making this car. It is a luxury car, but people were probably afraid to buy it because of the V-8. And no, you do not need premium. I have no problem with regular unleaded in this thing. Buy one if you can!"

At 125k miles keyless entry stopped working, cruise control, and some interior lights. Then engine light came on. 2 misfiring cylinders. Now I have a periodic check transmission.   Despite all this I attribute some of the problems to the accident before I owned it. And am seriously considering re investing to bring car back to 100%. The car is a great ride."

lincoln,continental,2002,Ray P, 06/22/2016,A luxury car for the budget conscience,5,"There's no denying that the auto industry has introduced a lot of new features on cars since 2002. Still, the Continental has all the features I could possibly ever want short of Bluetooth and an iPod interface. Some of you may long for a computerized interface such as MMI or iDrive but for me I've always found these interfaces to be highly annoying not to mention expensive to repair (they will eventually break).  

The Continental is great for those who don't want to spend much money for a reliable, safe, comfortable car.  The 4.6L V8 is as solid as they come although some might find the engine a bit unrefined by today's standards. Then again, I only paid $4,500 for my car two years ago with 76K on the clock and have had zero problems! I can deal with just a bit of ""unrefinement"" which is laughable because this is a really comfortable quiet car.

We love all the room, the trunk is YUUGE (yet my wife finds a way to fill it), the seats are very comfortable and the climate control system is the best of any car I've ever owned.  We appreciate the driver memory feature that adjusts the seat position for each driver.  Helps keep for a happy marriage. The car is also great in the snow being front wheel drive.  There is a bit of torque steer when you really romp on it but this is to be expected with 275 HP going to the front wheels.  MPG isn't bad for such a big, powerful car. I get about 22 on the highway (calculated) driving at 75-80 MPH while running on mid-grade. The engine doesn't object to this at all even though premium fuel is specified.  

One downside you should consider is the cost to replace air suspension parts which can be an expensive proposition.  The air pump in my car now runs every time I start the car which means the rear air struts are leaking and will likely soon fail leaving the rear of my car practically dragging the pavement.  Not a great situation to be in if out of town. I will soon be replacing the struts with a conversion kit that installs standard coil springs for an out the door cost of $1,200. Once in place I won't have to worry about any other air suspension issues (such as the air pump failing).  

 All in all, this is a great car for a budget conscience individual who desires a comfortable, quiet car with good performance.  True, the gas mileage isn't the greatest but the overall cost of ownership (inexpensive to purchase, insure, maintain, repair) adds up to quite a comfortable bargain.

I will repair everything but the engine and will continue to drive it.  We're over 122,000 miles and going strong.  I admit we've looked at replacing it, but with what??  A heavy car with a beefed up V-6 that won't last for more than six years?  Ford needs to bring this car back with rear wheel drive and a hefty V-8.

I went and had this car serviced as required and it's performance was indeed a pleasure. Just before 100,000 miles I had services preformed and the dealer found items to replace under warranty and all were done at no cost to me, they even provided a loaner while work was done.

it has a bit more noise than a rear-

The responsiveness, econony, and comfort of the car in its class is nothing less of superb.  While driving, the car is smooth and fairly quiet on even the noisiest highways.  Handling the car on curves and corners, especially at higher speeds, does bring out the car's size, but is handled rather well with it's electronic suspension system.  It may not be a hot rod, but it's not your dad's Continental either!  If you get one of these cars, make sure you get it with all the options, since this car is no longer available.

lincoln,continental,2002,Mike, 02/16/2020,2002 Luxury Appearance,5,"My daily driver is (was) a 60k mile 2005 Grand Marquis of which I'm the second owner.  It's the Anniversary edition and I love it.  I'm 6'5"" and it takes a big car for me to feel comfortable. Last November I had the opportunity to purchase the Continental.  It was a one owner 64k mile well maintained, always garaged etc.... I actually bought it to re-sell it but after driving it now for three months I love this car.  It gets better mileage than the Merc.  It's got a sunroof and a floor shift.  It shocks BMW's from stop lights.  It has a super audio system given it's a 2002.  The handling select for suspension and steering were far ahead of their time. Now is the time to buy one if you can get a low mileage one because you just don't see these on the road anymore that haven't been thrashed. The only thing I don't really care for is that mine is a ""Palm Beach"" model with the fake carriage roof.  Take off the traction control and have some fun with the 32 valve 4.6!

lincoln,continental,2002,Billcars, 03/28/2002,Noisy and uncomfortable,3,"From day one this car has been a complete disappointment.  Uncommon vibrations and very high ambient noise make it very uncomfortable.  The selling dealer didn't want to hear the complaints and said the noise and vibration were normal.  A second dealer replaced two front tires with flat spots and no mileage on them and put in new motor mounts.  The vibrations were stopped but the road noise is unbearable.

This was my first and last Lincoln."

lincoln,continental,2017,DC, 11/07/2016,"The continental is so nice, I bought one.",5,"UPDATE: May 8, 2018.  I still love the car and it continues to be trouble free. By far the most comfortable car for long drives.  Powerful, excellent fuel economy (24.8 mixed driving. I could get better mileage, but the engine is fun to rev.). The car is fast, quiet,  extremely comfortable and fun to drive. I highly recommend driving one before you buy any other luxury car. I bet you will be impressed. Over my lifetime I have owned many more expensive German cars but this is the nicest car I have owned to date.

UPDATE: November 8, 2017.  The car continues to be flawless.  I enjoy driving it and it continues to be a luxurious, comfortable, capable and quiet ride.  The gas mileage continues to get better, despite my tendency to enjoy the feel the torque of the turbocharged engine on acceleration. I would change nothing on the car.  If I did not own this one, I would go out and buy one today. The nicest car I have ever owned.  I have not been back to the dealership for any issues.  I soon will go to the dealer and receive my free oil change service. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I continue to marvel at the comfort, quietness and performance of this car.  It is so comfortable, smooth and quiet that now my other four cars seem noisy and rough.  I just love the perfect position seats.   I  had been looking for a luxury sedan for about a year. I test drove almost every model of every luxury brand and finally decided on the Lincoln Continental.  I bought the Reserve model with the 2.7 liter twin turbo engine (380 lbs. of torque) and the perfect position seats (Extra cost, but worth every penny).  The Continental is a really high quality, fast, quiet and comfortable car.  It is perfect for long trips, where you can enjoy the extremely quiet cabin and amazingly comfortable seats.  I tried every seat on the market and the heated and cooled Lincoln Continental Perfect Position seats are the best available anywhere.
    I have owned seven Mercedes S- class, several Cadillacs and Lincolns.  This Continental is by far the nicest of them all.  The quality of the leather and wood is outstanding as is the fit and finish of the entire car. The safety and convenience features of the car are wonderful.  Lincoln has invested a lot of time and money to design the new Continental and it shows.  Lincoln also has put a lot of money into their dealerships and I was pleased with how helpful the dealership and sales staff were.  I spent a lot of time driving every model to find the one I liked best and they were most accommodating.  
    I like the fact the Continental has six year power train warranty and a four year, 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  When the car needs an oil change or service, the dealer  will pick up the car at my home, perform the service, wash the car and return it to my home.  There is no fee for this service.  The car also comes with lifetime roadside assistance.  If needed, Lincoln will provide a loaner car.
This gives me assurance Lincoln has confidence in this vehicle and backs it with a very good warranty.
    There is one more thing I like about my Continental.  It is built in the USA by American workers.  If you are looking for a really nice, comfortable and well made luxury car, you should try the Lincoln Continental.

lincoln,continental,2017,BJR, 02/11/2017,Amazing beautiful car!,5,"Currently have less than 1,000 miles on the car and couldn't be happier with it. Initially got lousy gas mileage the first week but the dealer assured me it would get better and was stunned to get 32.6 mpg driving down I95. Usually runs about 20 to 24 mpg around town which I am pleased with. The car is extremely comfortable riding and people fight over who will sit in the front seat to get massaged.  Still trying to figure out all the gadgets and functions. Love that people stop and walk around the car and always comment on it. I have the white gold color and it is stunning. Did 6 months of research on about 10 different cars, luxury, sporty, muscle cars, etc. and am very pleased with our choice.

Update: I have now had the Lincoln Continental for 8 months and have almost 6,000 miles on it. I love, love, love this car! It is so comfortable, responsive and luxurious. There are no adverse comments that I can think of and I continue to have people fight over who will sit in the front seat to be spoiled by the massaging seats! Still getting great gas mileage, 32-36 mpg on the highway and 24-28 around town. It is very difficult to sit in a regular car after being in this one. 

I recently used a valet service for 5 days and every day who ever was parking the car commented on what a beautiful car and how they hadn't seen anything like it. My 4 grandchildren ages 6-10 always want to show their friends the car and they all have said they want to get a car like this when they are older.
"
lincoln,continental,2017,JRBoca, 12/22/2016,Surpising Improvement,4,"My fourth Lincoln in the past 10 years and first impressions are very positive albeit limited miles on the car so far.  Of the two MKX's and the MKZ hybrid I owned prior to this car, the new Continental is a winner.  The fit and finish inside and out are of the level of a higher priced vehicle.  I also own a 2015 SL 550 which I used as a benchmark.  I've got the 2.7L which I find to be quick and smooth for it's size and a little noisy on takeoff.  The updated Sync 3 system is solid compared to the previous ones I've owned.  All still much better than what I've got in my MB.  I've got the perfect position seats and they're pretty perfect.  These seats make this car and a must if you're considering buying one.  I got the standard radio which is disappointing for the overall price of the car.  I'll switch out the speakers with better aftermarket as a workaround.  I would have bought the Revel radio if they had one.  After I log a few thousand more miles, I'll update this review.
Here's my update on the car.  Still love this car and its overall performance.  My only issue today is the entry/exit mode where the steering wheel move up and away works sometimes and other times not and the dealer can't fix it.  Just had an airbag recall that was easily fixed.  The pick-up and delivery services works well and a nice feature.  Gas mileage is excellent for a big powerful car.  It still has the showroom look, feel and smell.  I've done a couple of 4 hour plus trips and the comfort is the best I've experienced.  One of my Mercedes friends and I had a trip and he was impressed.
Updat - had the car a year and still impressed. My only issue is the in/out feature as is works sometimes and not others and the dealer can’t seem to fix it.  This is more of a aggravation than anything else.

lincoln,continental,2017,Carlos, 10/18/2016,Great Car,5,"I just got the car from my dealer. First of all the Dealer experience was above the expected service. They delivered the car to me in a pristine conditions.  Fit and Finish is great, the seats are out of this world, I had a Mercedes E350 and the comfort and ambience this Continental has is way above the Mercedes. The power of the engine and the way it is delivered to the 4 wheels. It's feel in a category above. The only thing I would criticize is the fuel economy, if you get to happy with the engine revs then the fuel economy goes down...sad because the engine is a silky machinery that calls to be pressed.

lincoln,continental,2017,Mark, 03/15/2017,Had BMW 7 and Lexus LS,5,"After owning a BMW & and several Lexus LS's I found those care to be very good, however I thought for the dollars spent the Lincoln was a great value for the money.  I am very bid on how a car rides. And have found the Lincoln to ride very well, and the interior very quiet.  Bluetooth, and technology works great, and the electric doors are very nice.  Definitely best seating in any car I have owned, I have the upgraded seating.  Not like a foreign car, this car is very American.  I am not a bid fan of the sporty rides, and since I do not need a car that does 150 MPH, this is a pure luxury car and a better value for the money.
"
lincoln,continental,2017,Teach, 01/23/2017,Luxury without Wealth,5,"The Continental rides beautifully.  It handles the road, pot holes, like a Trojan horse.  It's cool, calm, heavy, and stately.  I have driven the Mercedes S class and have found this car to exhibit the same feel, and road manners as its Bavarian neighbor with out the big excessive money down, or astronomically high monthly note.  Compared to my 2013 MKZ this car drinks gas, but for the power, acceleration and poise which it exudes, I smile everytime I stand next to it.  This car is a Beast, and I mean that in a great way.  From some angles it looks like a Bentley.  I am more than pleased, I am humbled to have such an awesome ride.  The interior space is a dream come true.  My family fits without the adjustment of the front seats.  It offers the best seat in the house while on the road.

lincoln,continental,2017,Bob Sawyer, 10/14/2017,I love the loaner car,1,"I was the first to buy my new Lincoln and watched for it over two years. First major problem was the doors would not close, they are electric and I had to drive to the dealer holding the door closed with my left hand. The car was constantly shaking and dealer could not find a problem finally after taking the engine apart it was decided that I needed a new engine. Yes a new engine, and  a car with 24,000 miles. Get's better now my backup camera needs to be replaced. I am back in the loaner car..

lincoln,continental,2017,Nicholas Vigilante, 07/24/2017,The White Knight,5,"My Continental is a 2017 Select A200 with White Tricoat with the Cappuccino Leather/Espresso Wood interior, which prompted my wife to name it, ""The White Knight.""  I wanted a nice looking, comfortable, and well equipped luxury car.  This car has exceeded my expectations, especially the quality of the materials inside the car.  It is fast enough (but not meant to be a racer with a 3.7 Litre engine), it is incredibly quiet and comfortable, it rides so soft on any road surface, and it is solid with no creeks and rattles.  The Continental is also very safe, top rated by IIHS with a safety plus rating - that was an important factor.  I also like the free concierge maintenance pick-up and return plan that comes with the Lincoln, along with a free Lincoln loaner car while my car is worked on.  The Lincoln Dealership treated me extremely well during the purchase process.  They have a Lincoln Brand Champion Representative who gave me ""five star"" service acquainting me to the car, all its many features, and maintenance and service plans.
"
lincoln,continental,2017,Eduard Emil, 11/25/2016,Not up to date!,5,"I think I purchased the first one sold in wisconsin.  It's a beautiful smooth car with two problems.  Using the push button shifter, its very easy to mistakenly push the Reverse button instead of the Park button.  That could cause a serious accident if you don't double check which button you pushed before taking your foot off the break. Second annoyance is that the GPS is out of date because it doesn't accept addresses that my 3 year old Tom Tom in my truck or my PC's Mapquest does. It also displays out of date speed limits i.e., I-43 in Wisconsin is 70 mph, the GPS says its the old 65 mpg changed two years ago. I noticed this on other roads too, completely not up to date.  I am sure they figured on this for a future upgrade for $400  in a year or so as they did with my old 2010 MKS.  I complained about this to the dealer and they basically told me ""what you got you got,""  I called the Lincoln company and they sent me to a website where I could have spent the next two years of my limited life trying to figure it out.  I think for $74,000  they should take care of it!

lincoln,continental,2017,K. OBrien, 06/22/2017,Broken Wings,5,"While the company raves about the position seating, intense instruction on the ""key fobs"" and how to position the seat without damaging the  ""wings"" of the driver seat should be given.  Beginning on the first day of ownership figuring out all the ""new features"" seat positioning has been difficult.  The information that  the seat will only reposition back 2"" when the car was turned off, was never mentioned;  making it difficult enough to enter the seat the next time causing the wing to pull away from the plastic base to which it was secured.  Car has been in service department twice in 6 months and with the car being so new, there are no replacement parts.
"
lincoln,continental,2017,Marc K., 10/04/2017,Star Trek Technology in a Classy American Sedan,5,"I ordered the Reserve Model RWD 2.7L turbo, with about everything except the halogen lights and backseat package.   It took a little over 2 months to arrive but it was worth the wait.     When I drove the test model which had the 3.7L engine, I was wowed immediately by the LED instrument panel, the performance and the active noise cancelling system.   Upon delivery when I drove the car I thought that they had mistakenly put the 3.7L engine in it as I could not tell the difference in acceleration.   
My previous car was a 2011 Cadillac DTS.  Comparing these two regarding ride and handling, the Cady gets the edge on smooth ride, but the Lincoln blows away the DTS on handling.  Even in the “comfort” mode the car handles really nice, but you will notice a bump more profoundly if you are use to driving more of a land yacht.
The Good:   The technology is Star-Trek like.   The smart cruise, lane keeper, and emergency braking features work great.  I have a bad back and the seat massager is wonderful.  It works much better than that on the DTS.  I ordered the 13 speaker Revel sound system which blows away anything I have ever listened to in an automobile including the Bose systems.   If you are a music nut research Revel, you will be impressed.    The push button transmission is great, no clunky shifter in the middle to get in the way, and its idiot proof as you have to have your foot on the brake in order to put the car into D or R.   The backup camera system and over head profile view are very nice additions, and the on-demand front camera is great for getting into tight quarters.    The fit and finish and overall appearance are as nice as you could possible want, and I have gotten many compliments on the car since I have owned it.    
The Bad:  There isn’t much to pick at, but there are a couple of things I would like to see changed.  First the console is so far back that it is extremely difficult to access from the driver’s seat.   It would nice if they could redesign the console and move it forward 4 or 5 inches.     Second the translucent top which covers the entire car looks awesome but the sun roof only opens up about 1 foot, which left me a little cold.  
The Ugly:   The automatic parking feature did not work properly when the car was delivered.  The salesman and I drove the car around the lot testing it.  The system failed to identify perfectly fine parking places and then tried to back the car into a “space” about 5 foot wide – thank goodness the human driver can over-ride!   I have not had the car back yet for servicing so I don’t know what fixing it will entail.
My conclusion is the car is worth every bit of a 5 star rating.  I absolutely love it and encourage anyone interesting in a full size luxury sadden to test one out.

All I can say is what a great car.  The car looks great inside and out, there is nothing in my opinion that matches the Conty's style.  Understated class.  The car is very quiet and comfortable.  The perfect position seats are great and the revel system sounds great.  The car accelerates very well and has plenty of power for passing and getting down the road quickly.  What I also really like about this car is that it is all American.  I would recommend this car to anyone.

lincoln,continental,2017,Kimmy, 09/10/2018,2017 Ruby Red Lincoln -- Excellent Car!!!,5,"I also own a 2009 Lincoln MKS which I love and still have.  It is getting up there in mileage (176k) so my other half wanted me to have this.  Let me say while okay I could see the room for improvement in the MKS.  It looks like Lincoln made a note of all the lessons learned from that car and vowed not to repeat them on the Continental.  The Continental is a fantastic car.   One thing I like about Lincoln in comparison to other brands is the tech that is put into their cars is never convoluted or confusing to master.  I've previously looked at the Acura TLX, RLX, Hyundai Genesis (2015) and the G80.  While nice cars, each time I sat in one I felt like the setup was way too busy.   And sorry but I see so many Mercedes C300, 400 or whatever floating around it is no longer special to me.  It amazes me how both the MKS and Continental are about the same length but Lincoln managed to fit so much more back seat room and better trunk space into this new car than the MKS.   The Continental is a roomy big car that does not drive like one, which is great in my opinion.  Being able to switch between comfort and sport modes is nice.  I like a floaty ride but i'm finding that I like the sport mode better.  It provides good road feel while also exuding comfort.  The base engine has a nice pickup and unless you are a race car driver it is is good for everyday driving.  The upgraded engines seem like a ""nice to have"" but not having it is not a deal breaker on this car.   The gas mileage is acceptable but not great.  One great thing is this car can take regular gas but operates even better on mid-level fuel and doesn't necessarily need premium gas.   The 20-inch tires are way better than the 18 or 19 inches in my opinion.   If getting this car please do not do so without getting the Navigation or the Dual Moonroof.  Both add to the total experience of this car.  As for buying this car brand new, I don't know if I would pay 54K-80k for it but as a certified used car with a good warranty on it, it is an excellent buy.  Well worth the money.

lincoln,continental,2017,Steve M, 12/04/2018,Connie is the car of my dreams!,5,"This 2017 Continental Reserve with many Black Label options is/has everything I have wanted. It looks classy, it has plenty of power, it handles very well and yet has a cushy ride. It is the perfect blend of power, performance, comfort and tech. yes, there are euro cars that have better sport performance, but I wanted a luxury cruiser that can still do 0-60 in 6 sec. Massaging/heated/cooled front AND back seats??? Heck, I can start my car from anywhere I have internet access from my phone. If it's cold, it turns on the rear defroster, the heat and heated seats. THAT is BIG when you work inside a large building. I paid more than 15k less to get a similar equipped and sized car over the euro competition. I have owned MB, Caddy and Volvo, and loved each one of them.... this one beats them all.

lincoln,continental,2017,Ted K, 03/10/2020,"Incredibly QUIET, good power & a nice ride",4,"I have never driven a quieter highway car.  Truly amazing - even at 70mph.   Handles exceptionally well for a large sedan.   Almost too many bells and whistles - like the odd lack of standard door handles - you push a button instead.   Gee, what could go wrong with that idea?

The car is nicely shaped and has a spacious interior - even the back seat.   Addition of a sunroof takes away about 3 inches of headroom and most Continentals come through with the sunroof.    

The car is has a classy yet understated exterior except for the giant 20 inch wheels.  They are coarse and gaudy and spoil an otherwise elegant design.   The oversize wheels with low profile tires also compromise the cushy ride on back streets and country roads.  The big shiny wheels also shout ""pimpmobile""   18 inch brushed wheels would be far more tasteful and the car would ride even better.    
"
lincoln,continental,2017,Dwayne A., 05/17/2020,A tremendous amount of luxury for the price!,5,"First of all, I should mention that this Continental is the sixteenth Lincoln I have owned.  I bought my first (a three-year-old 1973 Continental Town Car) when I was eighteen years old.  At twenty-one, I purchased my first brand new one, a 1979 Continental Mark V.  In between there have been other Continentals, a Mark VIII, multiple Town Cars, a couple of Navigators, a Mark LT pickup, and an MKT.  Roughly half were purchased new, the rest were used.  After a massive stroke, my wife is unable to drive but we keep a sedan around because it's easier for her to get in and out of than my daily driver, an F-150 Super Crew Cab 4x4.  We bought this particular car as a Certified Pre-Owned recently.  I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I find the white platinum metallic tri-coat with cappuccino interior to be a lovely combination.  In my early sixties now, I really wish cars hadn't become so technical.  It's a sign of the times however, and the manufacturers have to keep up in order to survive.  Our son and daughter-in-law reside with us in order to help care for my wife so one allure of this particular car was its rear seat package.  Whoever is riding back there deserves just as much comfort as the front seat passengers.  The massage feature in the front and rear seats is phenomenal, as is the front seats' 30-way perfect positioning.  The Revel sound system is magnificent.  We purchased it at a dealership about a hundred miles from home so our first drive was a pretty good test of its comfort.  I personally find the ride (in comfort mode) to be similar to my last Town Car (2008) and better than my MKT (2012) or most recent Navigator (2016).  The front fascia reminds me of the 2011 Jaguar XJL Supercharged we used to have but the ride is considerably smoother.  It is my sincere hope that it will be more reliable as well.  That Jaguar, along with a BMW I owned years ago, led to me swear off any vehicle that isn't American!  Admittedly, we haven't had the car long enough yet to know how it's going to go but early indications are that we will be quite satisfied with it. I cannot think of anything else I could have purchased at the same price point that would have rivaled it for comfort and style.  

Edmunds is prompting me to update my review.  After having owned this Continental for six months, I can only say that I like it just as much as I did six months ago!  Its performance has been flawless and I continue to be impressed with just how much car it really is.  "
lincoln,continental,2017,Frank Quinn, 07/31/2018,Impressed,5,"I recently replaced my 2014 Lincoln MKZ. Prior to that I owned a 2010 and A 2011 MKS. I was impressed by the smooth ride of the Continental. I opted for the 3.0 400 HP AWD Model. This is the best Lincoln I have driven and has exceeded my expectations. I liked each MKS I had, I actually bought 2 with 3.5 Ecoboost engines, had but I love the Continental. American elegance mixed with power and performance is exactly what I was looking for. Didn’t expect such a smooth ride and all the features. Would highly recommend.

lincoln,continental,2017,Bill, 10/21/2016,Beyond Expectations,5,"I ordered the Continental in July. I was starting to get inpatient and wondering if it was going to be really worth the wait. Well, let me tell you that from the second I seen the Continental Pull up from getting out of detail, right away I knew it was worth the wait. This car is just BEAUTIFUL plain and simple. The pictures do it no justice, they do not capture the elegant curves that this Lincoln has. While I was waiting for it to be built, I was considering Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Cadillac. I am SO happy I waited it out and stuck with Lincoln. There is just something special when you stand back and look it at. It has many throw backs to the classic Lincolns while also including all of today's modern technology. The ride is so quiet and smooth. The massaging seats are AMAZING! I never wanna get out of the car! The door handles are awesome, just pull and the door opens effortlessly. All I can say is go to a showroom and go see it and drive one. Like stated above, all the elegant and classy curves are not captured on the photos that I have seen so far. I'm SO impressed. By the way, I'm 35yr old guy and I'm proud to drive this AMERICAN CLASSIC! I have the Black Label, Diamond Black exterior, Thoroughbred interior (gorgeous combo), 3.0 AWD. I would recommend at least getting the Reserve if able, the Black Label is just incredible.

lincoln,continental,2017,Ted, 11/28/2017,It is not a Town Car,2,"There is probably no suspension made that can smooth out low-profile tires. It rides like a sports car.  My Town Car rode like a boat in smooth water.  I can count the pavement strips with this car.  It takes a lot of time and manual reading to learn all of the controls. Then when you find them and do not use them, they are not intuitive. For example opening the moon roof at night at 60mph.  The controls to open the shade, the moon roof, the rear window shade, the interior lights and the rear head rest pop down ate all located in the upper center and are all slight indentations.  You can barely feel them and then there is no way to know without looking, what indentation you ate in.  The rearview mirrors are similar.  You have to feel around to find them.  Once you push the button for a mirror, then feeling for the directional control you are just as likely to push the door lock button or the button for the other mirror and now you are adjusting the wrong mirror.  I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER LINCOLN UNTIL THEY LEARN TO HAVE LEVERS LIKE THE TOWN CAR. The seats are very comfortable and easy to adjust.  The heating/cooling controls and fan control are great. Can you believe it? My Town Car had a 5 CD changer. This car not only does not have a changer, it has no place to put CD's except to drop them in a pile under the player.  Dimming the panel lights is again clumsy with flat buttons on either side of the light switch. Again you have to feel around.  It only dims the panel lights and not the center console screen.  You have to go through a menu system to do that.  The car is peppy and handles extremely well, like a sports car.  But I wanted a comfort sedan.  I drive a lifted Jeep with 37"" tires I drive to work, so I don't want to bounce in the car when my wife and I go out in the evening.  Gas mileage with premium gas is about 20-25mpg.  But who cares when you buy an upper scale car?  Finally be prepared to learn a new language called ""Lincoln."". If you give voice commands, you must say them precisely and to do so, you must go to the manual to learn them.  There are 26 commands to control the climate.  Say List of Commands and they will appear on the console.  The automatic parking is a terror. I won't use it. It whips in so fast you had better have your foot ready on the brake to stop it. The car is very quiet at highway speeds.  With the moon roof open, it is still very quiet. Maintenance - take the car in once a year or 10,000 miles - great! The self closing doors are nice. Interior lighting is great. The instrument panel is another aggravation.  Trip 1 & trip 2 require you to go to the menu to change the panel.  Tire pressure is a big picture showing the car and the pressure on each wheel.  It takes up way too much room and you lose other panel instruments, so back to the menu. Once I had to make several turns merging onto a highway.  It told me that I was drowsy on the instrument panel. It took 5 minutes of trying everything to make it go away until I found that you are supposed to touch the instrument panel where the warning is. ZZzzzzzz.  I tried the lane activation with no traffic.  If there had been a police car behind me I would have been pulled over.  It waits until it is over the right lane line before it steers left and then shoooooots over to the left line and then back again like it is drunk The cruise control works nicely and I like the way you can adjust the following distance.  I wish it had an ""accelerate"" like my Town Car, but you have to speed up and then press the reset button again. As a Ford car company owner since 1978, I love the keypad on the side.  I have never carried my keys or fob.

lincoln,continental,2017,Reggie , 01/17/2018,2017 Lincoln Continental Black Label,5,"I recently purchased a 2017 Lincoln Continental Black Label, with the Rear Seat Option and the 3.0 Engine.
I really enjoy driving this American made Vehicle. The driving dynamics of this vehicle are smooth, and comfortable at all times.
The Perfect Position 30 way adjustable seats are very comfortable. The Revel Stereo has a Awesome sound for listening to all types of music. The illumination of the Lincoln Welcome Mat is always impressive as you approach the Lincoln Continental.
The Interior lighting when driving at night, is a beautiful experience, and easy to navigate the controls when driving at night.
The Heads-Up Display is very easy to utilize in all lighting conditions.
The All Wheel Drive, with the Torque Vectoring is very impressive in all driving situations.

lincoln,continental,2017,Adam, 08/03/2018,Black label Lincoln Continental is Top shelf!,5,"I have people stopping me to tell me how good looking this car is.  I love driving it.  It’s so plush but has enough get up and go when I hit the gas to satisfy this former Dodge Charger owner.  The only criticism I have is I single rough shift between first and second that happens occasionally when coasting but otherwise it works like a dream.
"
lincoln,continental,2017,Tom McCauley, 05/18/2019,Serene Luxury with More than Enough Power,5,"Purchased as an off-lease car in November 2018.  It is powered by the 3.0 L twin turbo V6 with AWD; not the 2.7L (which was the only option in the Edmunds dropdown menu).  It replaced a 2007 Audi A6 Quattro.  The Lincoln is every bit as quick as was the Audi, and seems as sure-footed (although I really haven't pushed it yet).  The Lincoln's Revel stereo is the best I have ever owned; the ride is serenely quiet and the car solidly takes bumps in stride.  The 30-way adjustable front seats take some time to get used to, but properly adjusted provide adequate support and comfort.  The back seat is roomy enough for three adults.  The overall fit and finish rivals other luxury cars I have owned, including the Audi, a 1997 Jaguar XK8, and 1991 Lexus LS400.  The safety systems include all the latest bells and whistles, including adaptive cruise control, 360 deg cameras, and park assist.  The infotainment system is intuitive and much easier to use than my wife's 2015 Lexus.  The only nit I have on performance is with the transmission:  the six-speed tranny is very smooth during moderate or aggressive acceleration; but in stop-and-go traffic it sometimes lurches to find the right gear.  The car is averaging 19.4 mpg in mostly suburban driving.  Not bad for a 4300 pound car with a 400 HP engine - especially since it uses regular gas!

Update after a year:  Still very impressed with this car!!  It is solidly built and after 30,000+ miles there are no unusual squeaks or rattles even over very rough roads - something I cannot say about my wife's 2015 Lexus RX350.  Still averaging over 19 mpg on regular gas in city driving.  Ford finally produced a luxury sedan to rival the Germans.  I can't believe they announced plans to discontinue it!
"
lincoln,continental,2017,Ernie, 09/12/2019,Lease is up soon. To buy or lease again?,5,"Make sure you get the 30 way seats and not the 10 way.The transmission can be a little jerky at times but not really an issue. Engine gas been great. Battery went dead after 2 1/2 years but was replaced under warranty.10 way seats that came standard with the select model are way too hard and very uncomfortable on long trips.Had the car for almost 30, 000 miles and has been very reliable. car is ruby red and have had lots of compliments on it. Still on the fence as to whether to buy it or lease a new one. Update: Wish I had kept it. One of the best cars I have ever had!
"
lincoln,continental,2017,WDCraig, 05/10/2020,American Luxury,5,"Lincoln has done a great job with this modern interpretation of the classic American luxury car.   We bought it used, with 31,000 miles on it 3 weeks ago for $27k.  Thanks to the 4 year factory warranty, we still have 6 months remaining.  It had been a special order, leased car with a MSRP of over $55,000.  The options checked on this ""Select"": AWD, climate package, panoramic sunroof, blind spot/cross traffic detection and platinum white metallic paint.   The base normally aspirated 3.7 V-6 engine is the only demerit and it is a minor one.  On the plus side this engine is a long lived, powerful (enough) Ford standard which should be very reliable.  The engine's 305 horsepower while matching the power of the old V-8 falls short of the older engines in terms of smoothness and silence.  The exhaust note and vibration at idle are pronounced and while not unwelcome in a Mustang are out of place in this luxury car.   Otherwise I haven't a negative thing to say about this car after 3 weeks of ownership.  While styling and comfort are very subjective, my wife and I believe the car lovely, well finished and exceptionally comfortable.  With standard 10 adjustment seats, my wife, who is very particular; after the test drive pronounced it the most comfortable car she had ever sat in.  There is a certain exclusivity that attends Continental ownership; the highest sales year to date, was 2017 with 12,012 sold in the US; that same year Mercedes sold 15,888 of their flagship S Class in the US.  Among several other luxury sedans we test drove at the time of purchase, was a 2012 Mercedes S550 (50,000 miles and the dealership asking $5,000 less).  Indeed, I was surprised; the S Class had always been a ""halo car"" of mine.  Then again, they say best not meet ones hero and in fairness to the Mercedes, it was an older car by 5  years with 20,000 more miles on it.  The Mercedes was the superior ""performance sedan"" but I own a Corvette; so I have that covered.  The Continental was unquestionably a better luxury car than the Mercedes.  If you don't believe me; then you should drive them back to back as we did.  Another nice thing about this Continental is that even though it is 3 years old, it still looks as new as a 2020.  Rumors suggest 2020 or 2021 will mark the end of the car's production.  Sedans, at least in the US, are becoming increasingly rare, which is a real shame (we also own a AWD Highlander...so while we appreciate the ""utility"" of the 3rd seat and cargo capacity of the Highlander, we rarely need it unless we have out of town company).  There are many interesting things about the Continental, most already fully detailed by other reviewers; but I'll mention a few of my favorites.  The car welcoming you with lighting as you approach it is a nice classy touch- when dark, you can see the lights underneath the mirrors project down the Lincoln logo upon the pavement and upon opening the doors the word Lincoln is illuminated along the threshold.   The electric ""push button"" entry and self closing doors and trunk are literally a nice touch; together with the kick of the foot trunk opening and closing (it takes a bit of practice to master the trunk... center the foot and pretend you are kicking a ball...viola).  The cap-less fuel fill is nice.  This and much more, particularly with respect to the technology in this car (variable instrument cluster and Syn 3 system which is fairly user friendly compared to others).  I really appreciate the redundant manual HVAC and audio controls and we default to the manual controls over the touch screen.  The push button gear selection I could live with or without; it took my wife awhile to get used to it.  While the vertical placement makes for less of a reach, this and because the buttons are flat takes some concentration to select the right gear.  The touch pad door lock is handy for getting into the car and
 locking it without the fob.  A couple of things you might not read elsewhere- the hood, front quarter panels, fuel door and trunk lid are aluminum.  The glove box has a yellow button that opens an upper compartment where you can store your owner's manual (allowing for the full use of the glove box).  How many cars do you know of that have an AC outlet?  This car has one.  The cup holders for the back seat passengers in the fold down console is a nice touch.  The wood trim, is real wood, perhaps too nice, because looks artificial.  Also the split folding rear seats might offer some ""utility.""  Learning the car and its technology suite with its 538 page manual might prove to be a heavy lift for some.  It took me about a week of back and forth to get the car set up to our liking.   I've put our car in the ""comfort"" mode; that's what we wanted in a luxury car; and the car rides and handles great in hat setting.  If you are in the market for a well made, uniquely American (and American made) luxury car; you'd be hard pressed to find a better automobile.

lincoln,continental,2017,Karl, 12/09/2018,Not my Town Car,3,"Leased my Reserve AWD in March 18 after driving Town Cars for 20 years. While the Town Car is a dinosaur by comparison, its overall ride and storage capacity was far superior. That being said here are my thoughts so far at 7000 miles: PROS; 30 position massage seats though somewhat complicated to operate. MPG overall 23-24 and 27 Hwy on a few trips. 2.7 liter turbocharged engine offers good power. Above average rear seat room. Nice styling. Lots of bells and whistles though don't know if I'll ever use them all. CONS: Push button transmission can be slow to respond. It and everything is computer/electrically controlled including opening the doors. I'm old school and don't care for this trend. Dash display option unnecessarily complicated. No option for a temperature gauge. Owners manual 3/4"" thick and poorly organized. Below average trunk capacity but the rear seats fold down which helps. No power to auxiliary ports when engine is off.   Soooo... bottom line is I wish Lincoln still built a Town Car but with some of the tech updates and doodads that the Continental provides. The jury is out on whether I'll get another one when the lease is up

combined. Have had sensor issues and dealership telling me my vehicle was hit causing problem, no my car was not hit faulty sensor more like it. Since having it repaired STILL having detection issues.
Electrical issues more like it.
The noise from engine compartment is still as bad as new, Very loud in cabin when accelerating.  All in All, Never again is still my thought on this vehicle.
This is my FIRST FORD product and will be my LAST FORD product.
Hence my review title NEVER AGAIN.
For the money, much better cars out there. I’ll be looking at saying good bye to My Lincoln sooner than later, for sure.
23000 mile update.
Had Three recalls, seatbelt, airbag, door latch. Still have same feelings toward this car, although it does have good interior room.
On a recent recall service, got a Cadillac for a rental and it quite noticeably quieter than the Lincoln, not as roomy and interior was no match for Lincoln.
Cheap GM plastic.

lincoln,continental,2017,Paul C, 01/28/2017,"Small, hard, fatiguing seats",2,"Lincoln Continental Town Car's and Mercury Marquis's of the past offered large, soft, deeply foam padded from seats.  But this new 2017 Continental has small, hard, economy car like front seats.  So this is not a comfortable long trip car like the Town Car was. The push button gear shift is dangerous because the buttons are not clearly marked or color coded - I ended up pushing Park when I reached for reverse and vice versa and once I even pushed Park when I intended to select Drive. The ultra-wide 19"" wheels with 45 series tires detract from ride comfort as compared to the previous Lincoln Town Car.   Road and tire noise is well suppressed, but exhaust noise is prominent.  At idle, engine vibration is transfered to the steering wheel - yet another economy car like characteristic of this car.  Directional stability at highway speeds is only fairly good so the driver needs to maintain attention to keep the car in his lane - yes still another economy car like feature.  After renting this car for two days, I had no desire to own one.

lincoln,continental,2017,cape may, 01/27/2020,No front room space.,3,"I had a 2014 Lincoln MKS prior. The difference between both cars is major concerning the front seat. There is little room in the Continental. I have to have 2 auto settings for the seat. One to get in and out and one for driving. The seats retract minimal when turning the car off. Also the steering wheel does not move enough to the high side. The side of the front seat has broken off 2 times due to its figuration getting in and out. When I adjust the seat to my driving I can't see the sunroof controls on top without bending forward and down. The MKS had adjustable brake petals, head lites that turned towards the direction you were turning, heated  and a/c seats and when  you turned off the car the adjusted seats moved quite a bit up and down. The continental left a lot to be desired. I should have kept the MKS and are very sorry I have the Continental.

It had the options I would have selected: twin panel moonroof, CD player, 20 inch aluminum wheel , and climate package. Since I live in a snow belt AWD with a 61,235 sticker. I was impressed with the power and torque of the 2.7 twin turbo motor that uses regular gas. It’s torque rating is only 20 ft/lbs shy of the optional 400 horse motor. So I took the plunge and am amazed at 30mpg at 65 mph and 24 mpg overall ( more hwy driving than city).  No quality issues so far. People compliment my color choice! It’s a comfortable car wit limo like back seat. I didn’t get the optional stereo, and it’s not necessary. In short so far so good and a good value!

lincoln,continental,2018,BG , 08/31/2019,Much more car for the $$$,5,"I would like to thank all of the pretentious Euro sedan fans and critiques who thumb their noses at American luxury vehicles.  Thanks to you, I was able to purchase a new Continental Reserve loaded up with all the features for less than 50k all in and out the door!   I love my new Conti which had a sticker of >70k.  The 30 way seats and massage are super comfy, the 19 speaker revel system is fantastic, the HUD is not something I was looking for, but now that I have it, I love it.  The ride is smooth and it has plenty of ""giddy up"" even with the mid level 2.7L TT @335hp.  No it is not high performance and I didn't expect it to be.  The ride is smooth and comfortable, long trips are enjoyable and it has plenty of get up and go when needed.  For less than 50k, this vehicle was a steal and Lincoln's poor sales seems to be more about everyone's desire for the Navigator and other SUVs rather than any shortcomings in the Conti.  If you are in the market for a luxury sedan, I would recommend at least driving a Conti and running the numbers.  No way I could've landed a new Euro sedan with all the options for under 50k.

lincoln,continental,2018,converted caddy to lincoln, 04/13/2018,Caddy to Lincoln,5,"Well been driving Caddys with Northstar for for past 30 years, and hands down this is a better car, however, I have issues with some for Fords decisions, like for example, the radio on is not remembered based on driver (FOB), the display also is not remembered -  65K for a car that cannot retain the radio and display setting for the fob used like really?  That said after driving a CT6 and This Conti, 1. Value for money ++++, 2. Confort +++, 3. I Hate Fords and gave a try when brought back a REAL car name AND they won me over with this car - THO ticks me off on a couple points, like the radio / display as mentioned above, the global windows don't open the moon roof as advertised on Lincolns site and still awaiting Ford/Lincoln exec to contact me (been 2 months), 4. Seeing mixed reviews, the target market should love this care DRIVE it with the 3.0, your mid - life crisis and need for lux AMERICAN CAR are wrapped in one.  I will agree with the mixed review on the 6 speed trans -  very poor when traveling 70 on highways / shifts erratically when need to pass, and the MPG not any where near what my v8 Northstar got, so those are also negitives, but someone in this market not gonna care about the MPG - (nor am I - that's moot).  Over all i would rate 4+ stars, and I only considered FORD because they didn't take bailout money, my original choice to replace the Caddy (as the CT6 was frankly not something i buy with the pricetag or the comfort) was a german car, but i rather own AMERICAN car, and have never owned a forigen car.  Value for money the Conti should be looked at.  NOTE TO EDMONDS you don't allow or show the 3.0 so selected the 2.7 - please fix.

March 2019 Update - still love this car, and i can frankly say after a year and now after 10K in miles its the best car i've ever owned, I still have yet to here fro Lincoln / for on the global window open problem, what a joke thier 30K fusion, and other liclons with factoey mon roof the global open it, but not on the conti, what a joke - and a joke not getting Ford / Lincoln to sofrrect such a simple software problem.  FORD PLEASE RESPOND BEEN A YEAR STILL WAITING!

Sept 2019 (20190922) -   Still yet to here from FORD or Lincoln on the GLOBAL WINDOW OPEN on the Conti, and roof not opening - FOR SUCH A SIMPLE CODE UPDATE.  Secondly, all fords that have the keyless entry after code you use 5 to open trunk also dont work on the CONTI, but on all other Fords and Lincolns works.  Over all i STILL LOVE THE CAR, and would recommend it (the 3l TT 400HP model, BUT FORD CORP apparently can care less on make customer happy and fixing these minor software issues on this specific car - makes no sence 70K for a car and the 20k cheaper car Global Window Open works properry for the sunroof) and the 5 after code to open trunk also does.  FORD RESPOND!  I choose you because your took NO bailout money like your US compitors did, and expected betters support on these to topics.

09/2020 - Still a fantastic car and still love it.  Lincolns service is absoloutely fantastic, GM dont even come close.  Only one compliant is the map updates this is second time had to pay for it to get updated.

lincoln,continental,2018,Capti, 08/31/2020,You have to love it to own it...,4,"It’s easier to identify Continental by what it isn’t rather than what it is. While it’s bigger then an Audi A6 or a BMW 5 Series it isn’t a true Mercedes S Class or BMW 7 Series competitor.  While the 400 HP Turbo 6 packs enough punch to leave most cars behind - you’d be silly to toss it around corners like a Beemer or even a Cadillac. 

What it is - is a dignified domestic Luxury car that appeals to your heart rather than your logic. You can go on for paragraphs about this cars features, it’s materials, and it’s driving finesse but it truly shines in ways that can’t be measured. Out west where domestic cars in general are in short supply Continental turns heads with it’s classic styling - almost as much as our Porsche. 

We purchased our used 2018 Continental with only 12,000 miles. Mechanically the vehicle has been fairly reliable. My only complaint is buggy electronics and a strut that failed under 40k miles. Our dealer inspected / replaced both free of charge. Lincoln warrants their vehicles for 5 years and 50,000 Miles. With the complexity of these vehicles I recommend that you search for a low mileage Pre Owned model. You’ll reap the benefits of a significantly lower buying price and Lincoln’s stellar dealer service. 

Which brings me to my last point. LINCOLN’S DEALER NETWORK IS PHENOMENAL. I’ve owned several luxury branded vehicles and Lincoln has offered me the best service of any dealership I have ever experienced. On demand vehicle loaners, drop off service, no questions asked warranty repair. It’s obvious Ford is looking to boost the image of its premium marquee.

lincoln,continental,2018,MDB, 02/08/2019,I miss my Cadillac DTSs- had 2 before this mess.,3,"No large American sedan choices so I ordered a Continental in March of 2018.  My husband picked all the bells and whistles he fell in love with from the tv commercials.  We waited until the end of July for the delivery.  Within the first few weeks, the ac went out.  Dealer probably goosed the Freon but it lasted until the weather changed.  Fourth month the trunk refused to respond, not to the fob, not to the dash button, not to the emergency pull in the trunk.  After TWO WEEKS in the shop and supposedly a latch change and a complete reprogramming of the car, dealer admitted that the car was ""too new and no one knows much about it""... but they did get the trunk to work.  Month six, no more exterior sensor warning system or parking assist.  Decided to drive it from Virginia to Florida anyway and guess what we found in Florida, NO AC - again.  Dealer's response, we verified the ac is not getting cold but couldn't find a leak.  We charged it and added dye.  If it acts up again, get it back in and they should be able to find the leak.  Dealer's response to no sensors - they worked fine for them, ""it's going to have to be one of those things that needs to bring back when it is happening more often.""  It hadn't worked for almost two weeks the day it was taken in so I have no clue what ""more often"" might mean.  I'm not thinking I'm going to keep this car long if this becomes a pattern.

lincoln,continental,2018,Fred Domin, 01/14/2019,Very Disappointed,2,"It is pathetic that Ford calls this car their Lincoln Flagship.  For the past 10 years I have owned 5 Lexus,1 Equus and 1 Cadillac SUV.  Lexus has it over all of them including this Lincoln.  The Lincoln interior appears to be made of cheaper material.  Road stability does not compare to the 2014 Lexus LS460 that I traded in.  I checked the used  value with less then 2000 miles on this Lincoln after owning it one week and found that the Purchase price of  $45,998 was worth less than $40,000 and my Lexus trade in had an asking price of $37,995 on that Dealers lot.  My 2014 trade in was almost worth what the 2017 Lincoln.   I did request the salesman along with the used car Manager to cancel this purchase and return my trade in.  I was told that if I was not happy with this Lincoln that they could put me into another vehicle.  After my Lincoln experience I can say honestly that I will not own another Ford/Lincoln product.

lincoln,continental,2018,Ben McMillan, 12/16/2018,Initial drive disappoitment!!!!,3,"I drove this from the selling dealer to my home, then directly to the repair shop!  My ""new"" 2018 Continental Reserve was my worst new car experience out of 16 vehicles I have purchased! Very disappointed in its initial quality and multiple malfunctions which so far has the vehicle in the repair shop 3 weeks and counting to make it drivable. Switching from foreign to USA made vehicle seems to be a mistake!! My patriotic move to support USA made vehicles didn't pan out!!  Very disappointed they did not replace the vehicle to make it right, rather was told I had to accept the extensively torn apart repaired vehicle!! Who knows what else I might find wrong with this ""lemon!!!"" Drove a Continental from the selling dealer to the repair shop!! Pretty sad for a ""luxury"" vehicle!!!.  Malfunctions/failures include Audio system malfunction, Speaker failure, Fuel system software, Oil pan leak, damaged drivers panel, Welcome lighting intermittent failure, Collision alert intermittent, Adaptable suspension iffy (drove similar Reserve and found much smoother).  I hope the other buyers have better luck, because Lincoln certainly did not live up to their name on this one!!!! My expectations were high going in, which I'm sure is the reason for the huge disappointment. No combined fuel rating can be given due lack of ownership and malfunctioning  fuel system.

lincoln,continental,2019,ifixc5, 12/08/2020,"Comfortable, not quiet!",3,"A comfortable and high tech car, but in no way smooth or quiet riding! My F150 rides smoother and more quiet, which was a huge disappointment! Love the high tech, but fell short in some areas, such as lack of audible alert in blind-spot warning. Another pet peeve is the no side view mirrors tilt down availability. Using the parking monitors are not exactly accurate! A sharp looking vehicle with an excellent interior, but some areas fall short with plastic and flimsy trim. This vehicle also requires daily driving of 30 minutes or more in order to maintain proper battery amperage, otherwise, many functions will shut down to preserve battery. Approach lights, door locks, remote start, will be inoperative due to lack of usage, and I use the vehicle as much as 5 times a week with 10-20 minutes if driving each day, but apparently not enough! The idea of preserving the battery is a great idea, but when it shuts down convenience, it becomes a huge inconvenience!!

lincoln,mkc,2015,moon63, 12/28/2015,"I still love this vehicle, no regrets!",5,"I purchased this vehicle for three reasons. The first being, I am a empty nester, 2nd I am retiring soon, and lastly I wanted to own a vehicle that would be fully equipped with all of the bells and whistles. I deserve it! Having the vehicle for one year, I could not be more pleased.  This vehicle is worth every penny that I spent. It is a very good looking car, and holds itself quite nicely compared to other small luxury cuvs. I have been getting exceptional gas mileage in the city. This vehicle handles quite nicely and is very quiet. I have read reviews where some critics argue that it does not handle like some other sport cuvs. If I wanted a sporty car, I would by a ""sports car."" I want a smooth, quiet, soft ride. The safety features, the technology, real leather heated and cooled seats, you cannot beat it for the price. European vehicles would cost a lot more with the same packages. I know this for a fact! I have owned my share of European vehicles and base my statement on actual ownership.
 This is a vehicle worthy of being referred to as a luxury vehicle.

Synch seems to be surprisingly better than my first experience and this is the best Bluetooth phone quality in any car I have experienced. If you are looking for a small luxury SUV, you should make time to test drive an MKC. "
lincoln,mkc,2015,olekiller, 01/13/2015,Shocked,4,This is my 1st cross over. I also own a 2014 volvo s60 t6 awd that I love dearly. But this car got me in the sweet spot and i'm a 27 year old. If you're looking for 0-60 times or engaging performance looks elsewhere. But if you want a car that can carry some bags and make driving after a long day the easiest thing in the world. This is your one of the best option. Sometimes during hwy driving I purposely take the longer route so I wont have to get out(no lie) its so easy to drive. I would've never looked at lincoln before. The only thing I hate is the placement of the gear change please give me a stick back.  
lincoln,mkc,2015,Steve, 04/25/2016,Awesome Vehicle,5,"We narrowed our choice down to the MKC and the Acura RDX.  They both had many of the same features, but we like the more luxurious interior and eye catching exterior of the MKC.  The RDX just looks like another Honda on the road and we wanted something else.  We have the 2.0 and find it has plenty of power.  The transmission shifts smoothly and we love the Sport mode.  At night the car has so many great lighting features including the welcome mat, lighted outside and inside door handles and the ambient interior lighting (with 6 color choices).  Our only negative feedback is the back seat room when the front seats are pushed all the way back - a little snug.  However, our car has the heated back seats and that makes up for it in the winter time!  I would recommend this car to anyone that wants to feel like they are driving a European car but wants to by American.

lincoln,mkc,2015,BC, 10/07/2015,Wow great car!,5,"I was getting a little tired of getting in and out of a small car everyday and went looking for a mini-luxo-crossover (or whatever you call them, now) for my daily hour drive.  Admittedly, the only reason I thought about this car was those silly commercials.  But still, I took a look and was surprised.  For the sticker price on the lot, you cannot compare this to some of the cars mentioned in Edmunds review.  I put $45k as a top on what I wanted to pay.  My local dealers did not have an MB GLK or Audi Q5 for less than $47k on the lot.  And the only BMW X3 I found under $50k didn't even have nav!  Really?   Yes, there was a Volvo XC60 or two that fit in my range.  But not as loaded as I was able to get my MKC.  I got the upgrade 2.3l engine, awd, the nav package, and several other options, including the incredible panoramic roof for $44k before any haggling or rebates.  I would say this model straddles segments as it more directly competed in price with the MB GLA class, BMW X1, Infiniti QX50, Audi Q3, and Volvo XC70, all of which I'd call tall wagons.  None had the ride height of the MKC.  The only vehicle I would say directly competes is the Acura RDX.  It did have more space and otherwise had similar features for the price, topping out at $44k.  But, honestly, the 3.5l V-6 in the Acura felt gutless compared to the 2.3l turbo 4 in the MKC.  That was probably my deciding factor.  In all, I'm thrilled w/ my purchase.

He sent me to look at the MKC.  After a five minute test drive I bought it.  I live in West Virginia in a rural area on a mountain top.  It handles the twist and turns and ruff roads with ease.  It has never left me stuck on the snow or ice.  It climbed up the mountain during a winter storm without slipping once.  It's beautiful to look at (much better than the boring Honda CRV) and fun to drive.  When traveling I can take it out of Sport mode (I use this on the twisty back roads I drive daily) and place it in Comfort mode.  I have two small issues with it; cargo area and SYNC.  It has half the storage area of my old Grand Cherokee and I have the first edition of the SYNC and it has a couple of bugs that have been worked out in the second edition.  All in all I love it.  It's beautiful to look, comfortable for my 5'9 middle aged body, and easy and fun to drive.

lincoln,mkc,2015,E. Prescott, 10/14/2016,2015 Rust after 1 year,2,"The car is fun to drive, and is comfortable. However it's like putting lipstick on a pig. I have been in and out of service for the last year, and a half. Is it great I get a rental each time. Sure is. At would have been worse without it. The amount of trips I have had to the dealer planning around my family is not something I expected in owning a brand new luxury vehicle. I was in for a broken amp 4 times. Headline did not fit from the factory, it took four attempts to fix. My automatic mirrors went on the fritz, and that is common in these vehicles. I was back and forth to the dealer during rush hour which was a far drive. Then there is the rust, at around a year in my husband found it. Now my husband washes and waxes my vehicle regularly. I have never had a vehicle rust in the first year. Yes Lincoln removed the rust. So far twice at two different dealers. These are both on the front drivers doors on the bottom along the wedge. We started wondering why our vehicle rusted after a year. Then I started noticing that after a hard rain, when I would open the door water would gush out. My husband noticed he could put his thumbnail in the seam right below where the rust was. Clearly this was the cause. Lincoln however and their service departments refuse to recognize this as a problem, or rectify the issue. We found a site where the GMC Terrains and Equinox's have the same water issue, and they suggested replacing the  weather seal around the frame of the door. Lincoln's response was GM's doors are engineered differently, and ""the doors are doing what they are engineered to do"" At this point I started doing reviews on Lincoln's Facebook page. Slowly my links are being deleted, and I found others who had the same thing happen. Lincoln is not a reputable company. Also if you look up Ford Rust, or Look up Ford Escape Rust it is all over in the same spot on the doors on the Escapes. Sounds like an engineering defect. I would caution anyone from buying any products from Ford/Lincoln. I know I won't be buying on in my lifetime.
"
lincoln,mkc,2015,Tom, 01/04/2016,I always liked Matthew Mcconauthey. : ),5,"This is an update from my first input five years ago.  The vehicle was five years old as of the end of October and we have about 56,000 miles on it.  Thus far, there have been NO repairs.  Just maintenance and one recall for a problem with some of the series' door locks and a computer module, which they replaced just in case.  (We hadn't experienced any of the noted problems with those features.)  The vehicle came with Pirelli tired.  Wore them completely out before changing them, but got 55k out of them.  Much better tire wear on this vehicle than my 2006 Mercedes E500 4-matic.  (That car literally eats tires -- I'm luck to get 30K out of 45k tires.)

Completely satisfied -- thrilled really -- with this vehicle.  Ford has come a long way and hit it out of the park with this one.  Then again, I was strategic in my choices.  Decided on it because although it was a first year vehicle with all the bells and whistles, including auto park assist, the technologies were all proven already on their other vehicles.  Essentially, all they did was take the MKX and shrink it a little.  This is essentially the MKX but on a Ford Escape rather than Explorer chassis.

As long as Ford doesn't cut any corners in future production, they're going to do well with their line up.  We're fully satisfied with this vehicle; very happy we bought it.

In a nutshell, we bought this vehicle for my wife a couple months ago, so we don't have a long experience with it.  But all the things listed above is what made us go with this vehicle.  We were originally going to go with the new for 2014 Jeep Cherokee, but with all the problems owners were complaining about, especially with the new 9-speed transmission, I steered the wife away from it.  We really linked the appearance and feel of the Limited, but I've had more than my share of problem vehicles and it was clear from the 5 for, 43 against, owner reviews that we should avoid that SUV like the plague.  In the end, we feel in love with the Lincoln MKC and so far we have not regretted the purchase.  It's amazingly smooth riding and quiet -- it's even better than my 2006 Mercedes E500 -- and yet very peppy.  We wanted the 2.0L engine, but wound up with a loaded model which came with the 2.3L ecoboost.  Interestingly enough, however, on a recent trip home from Williamsburg, VA we found we were getting 28 mph rather than the advertised 26 mph for the AWD model.  What we really love about it is it's quite responsive and great on gas for a luxury SUV, but runs on regular, and I'm not talking 89, but 87 octane fuel.  The dealer told is it's designed to use the regular 87 octane and to not be afraid to do so.  Amazing and it uses considerably less fuel than my wife's previous vehicle, an Infinity G37 coupe, which ran on premium only.

lincoln,mkc,2015,loucatfan, 11/13/2014,Fun to drive quality SUV,5,"I love my MKC.I searched for a year and drove every luxury brand small SUV. This one is the best. Solid with all of the cutting edge technology in a Small SUV. 

The HID headlights and interior lighting are the best I have ever seen.Love the Blind spot cross traffic feature. With the Lincoln Drive Control option(which is a must) the car drives as smooth as a large sedan like the Avalon I traded in.

 The engine is peppy and equal to my wife's 2012 BMW X 3. The workmanship the best I have seen on the interior and exterior.I love the styling and how it drives. Tremendous value for the money and No it is Not an Escape warmed over. This car is unique and I could not be happier with it
 After driving the car for 27 thousand  miles I could not be happier. It is a fun car to drive. Reliable. Has all of the bells and whistles. I particularly use and like the blind side alert in the side mirror.  

I love the sirius radio which it works great. The size of the car is really one thing that is best for me. I like a small car to zip in a out of parking spaces . Short turning radius. but the feel and quality of a large car. this car still feels tight and new after  a year and a half of driving and 27 thousand  miles. The linclon drive control feature  makes it have the road feel of my old Avalon which was two feet longer and heavier. 
 
 This is the best car I have ever owned and I don't know why everyone doesn't want one.

The only issue I have is with the navigation system. It goes haywire and sends us in circles ever now and then . Have taken it to the dealer four times and paid $150 for an update but still not comfortable with it. 
Still love the car and dealer . They try but I just think the system Lincoln put in this first model has bugs in it.
 Another negative issue is the message feature which does not work . Lincoln says it is Apples problem and Apple says it is Lincoln s problem . I’m stuck in the middle . It is a very convenient feature which my wife uses on her Lexus and which I should have but neither Lincoln or Apple can figure out how to make it work , shame since I love everything about the car except the navigation system and the fact the texting feature I paid for doesn’t work.

lincoln,mkc,2015,Sabomnim, 01/29/2017,Lincoln MKC- I had no idea I would like it so much,5,"I bought my 2015 Lincoln MKC used and have owned it 2 weeks and put approximately 1,000 miles on it including a round trip road trip and daily commuting to and from work. I really like this little SUV and wish I had test driven one earlier. I found an almost completely loaded “Reserve” model with lots of nice options including a Technology Package. Mine has the 2.0 eco boost engine and is FWD. 

I’m 54, 6’ and 190#’s – I just give this as reference so you know who is reviewing the vehicle. I have owned many vehicles from domestics, imports, sedans, coupes, and full size SUVs. I have owned several of the newer iteration Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit’s – I really loved my 2013 but was not as impressed with my 2015 so I sold it and began my search for another vehicle. Recently, I test drove (all used but newer) Mercedes GLK, Audi Q5, and a Cadillac SRX. I really wanted to like all of these cars but for one reason or another did not feel right in them. I realize that there are lots of personal preferences that go into a car decision- that’s why there are so many choices! So I was searching and found the Lincoln MKC at a dealership and decided to check it out – I really didn’t think I was going to like it.

First impression, the exterior styling and fit and finish on the MKC is very good; it is a very solid looking vehicle. The interior- very nice. Again, fit and finish and materials used are very good. Not only do they look good, the interior is very attractive – it looks much better in person than in pictures. Driver and front passenger’s seats – very comfortable and contouring to the body. The leather is very supple and feels like very good quality. I did not think I would like the ‘push button’ gear selector but if frees up for more storage space and it’s actually kind of cool. Took the MKC for a road test and again, super impressed. So, I bought it!

Here are the things I really like about this car: 1) The fit and finish and materials used are all very good. The MKC I bought had 21,000 miles on it and I hear no creaks, squeaks, or unwanted noises! 2) the vehicle is very comfortable and quiet 3) The ride is very nice and smooth- it feels like you are in a much bigger vehicle. If you want a little more responsiveness, however, the ‘sport’ mode gives you just that – the sport mode is definitely more fun to drive in. 4) acceleration for this vehicle is amazing to have a 2.0 turbo engine – the engine is refined and quiet 5) in the short time I have owned it, with a combo of around town and interstate driving, I am averaging right at 27 miles per gallon 6) Lots of nice features, great stereo, pano roof, lots of tech stuff, voice activated tech, heated and cooled seats  7) decent utility for a small SUV

Some things you may not like: 1) this is an overall fairly small SUV – I’m 6’ and find it plenty accommodating for me. 2) The back seat space is fairly limited – if you are car pooling or taking adult size children around, it may be too small. 3) If you truly need and SUV for hauling some cargo and lots of stuff in the back, again, this one is on the small side. 4) The tech and navigation takes a little bit to get used to, but it is not bad. 

If you are in the market for a smaller SUV, I highly recommend you test drive a Lincoln MKC; I have been pleasantly surprised.

lincoln,mkc,2015,skirk51, 12/03/2014,"A nice SUV, but not perfect.",4,"Front seats are extremely comfortable.The  leather wrapped steering wheel feels superb.  It is a good height for getting in and out of easily. Gas mileage seems to be as advertised. But after driving it for three months, I have regretted my decision to buy.  The ride seems harsh and jarring.  I wish I had not let the dealer talk me out of waiting for one with the CCD. And why would a luxury vehicle (Select trim) not have a power adjusting steering wheel connected to the memory settings!  Even worse, the lever for manually adjusting the steering wheel is very difficult to engage. Cargo space proved to be too limited for a trip with four adults.  "
lincoln,mkc,2015,swim_mom, 03/10/2015,I have NEVER been so disappointed in a Ford product or their Customer Service as I am right now!,1,"I have only ever owned Ford products and I had to have the New MKC, I bought the 1st on the lot.  Lets just say, total disappointment!!  My transmission ""shattered"" in the middle of the highway at 9k miles, all the ABS sensors have been replaced, the emergency brake engages sporadically while I am driving. This vehicle is not safe to drive and has left me in unsafe conditions on several occasions, that is not what I paid $45,000 for.  I filed Lemon Law with the BBB so now Lincoln has told me that they can no longer help me or repair my vehicle under the warranty because I had to go and file a complaint with the BBB as my right as a consumer.  I have never been treated so poorly in my life! "
lincoln,mkc,2015,Ben, 04/10/2018,Good car but VERY ford!,4,"My family has a lot of cars; this one is perfect for my Mom. While technology, safety, and ease of use is exceptional this car lacks refinement. While quieter than many other cars, once you hit 70mph you will hear road noises, this is masked by having an amazing sound system (better than most cars). The drive is generally soft and smooth, and the first time you drive it it’s a good amount of fun; but after the 14th-1000th drive it feels artificial. Electric steering has no feeling, acceleration is all or nothing with a touchy throttle, the car handles well but only because of torque vectoring (safety feature where some of the will wheels brake indpendently as determined by computer), and the engine has a very annoying grinding sound especially at high revs. Braking; however, is very smooth and much better than any previous ford I’ve been in. There’s a very unrefined jerk the car gives when you shift into drive, or when you take your foot off the gas. Interior is good, it’s very attractive with customizable lights and attractive gauges but again like a Ford it gets small details done exceptionally well but massively drops the ball on large quality details. Steering wheel feels cheaper than what you’d expect on a nissan, there are gaps underneath the cover with the lincoln badge big enough for a finger. The plastic bits on major areas you make contact with everyday feel poorly held together, and the key is just chrome covered plastic.        Alright all that out of the way, why do I say car is 4/5 stars over all? It’s more reliable than similar cars and a better value. Although I personally dislike it and notice all the small issues (and left several out) the cars only major flaws are a lack of refinement. If you’re looking for a crossover suv that looks really nice and is loaded with features that drive the car for you, you’re in luck. While driving you won’t even notice the lack of refinement if you haven’t driven a hundred other cars. Most of it is superficial, and the sound system is so good you might just not care anyway. All in all the low information gauges (which I haven’t previously mentioned) are much more annoying than the cost cutting feel of the car. Because of this 3 or 4 out of 5 stars is the most accurate way to describe the car.

Test drove the GMC Acadia Denali, Cadillac, 4runner , Enclave, Jeep, Q3. All but the Buick had rough tight rides and were pretty loud.
I like the design , sleek and modern, Lincoln is trying to reinvent themselves with younger designers resulting in smoother contours and open dash presentation are become Lincoln standards.
The double winged grill is also very appealing and unlike the MKX has decreased height and has a more polished finish.
I am happy with Sync as well, but it could be better.
Back seat is a bit tight, but for rare office colleague lunch drives it's okay."
lincoln,mkc,2015,gr8_g8_gt, 06/10/2015,Enjoyable compact luxury crossover,4,"I have a 2.3L Reserve model that is almost fully loaded. It rides nicely, is fairly quiet and has decent pick-up. Mileage has been around 20 mpg in mostly city driving, which I find disappointing for a 4 cylinder. I love all the features like push-button start, heated & cooled memory seats, heated steering wheel, etc. I downsized from a Ford Edge and like the more compact vehicle, although back seat legroom is tight and the cargo area is a bit small. As with the Edge, the A/C doesn't modulate well; it's either too cold or too warm. It's been a very reliable and enjoyable vehicle, and I get lots of compliments on it.

lincoln,mkc,2015,Katrina, 12/26/2017,Overall a nice car..,4,"It's a fun ride with all the bells and whistles that you would expect when buying a luxury car. The heated steering wheel is probably my favorite feature. The blind spot sensors are nice as well. Great acceleration and a quiet engine.. sleek interior and exterior. It's a beautiful car. I've only owned my MKC for a month and the major con thus far is the gas milage. I'm averaging 20mph and seem to be running the to gas station more frequently than I would have expected. The trunk space is a little tight as well. My 20 lb dog's crate hardly fit in the trunk and left little room for anything else. I guess this is to be expected for a smaller SUV.. the MKX would be a little more spacious.

lincoln,mkc,2015,Cindy Brandt, 03/27/2018,Gammy's MKC,4,"I have only had the MKC for 3 months. I love the the dark brown interior, especially for transporting 3 dogs periodically and a grandchild. It takes time to get used to the foot tailgate opening. When choosing to call someone on the screen if you don't prop your hand at the bottom you will accidentally hit the parking assist button.

lincoln,mkc,2015,Shailaja Menon, 03/03/2016,All that glitters is not gold!,3,"I purchased this after decent evaluation and test driving 18 other midsize crossover models. Boy - what a weekend that was...Phew!! I test drove Lincoln MKc twice - both the 2.0 and 2.3L version. The ride was amazing. So smooth - so elegant and luxurious. Definitely won my heart and purchased it. The customer care at my dealership was amazing and I should give the 5+ start for that. Very helpful and patient. The ride remained smooth only for a month or so and the rattling and vibration, road noise started slowly filtering in. If I am parked and talking on my Bluetooth - it can easily heard from outside - no privacy. My music is also heard as if the windows are open. Same with the wind noise the air tight noise control lasted a limited time. I have 50K + miles on my odometer and the highway mileage is 90% of it and still my avg mpg is 20.3. And I do no drive on traffic highways or rush hours times. The roof material tucked into the door on the drivers side ias already out of the tucking and looks so trashy - happened with few months of purchase. Sure the car is amazing on test drives and even when you maintain it well and treat it gently and drive mostly highways the roughness and brittle start showing fast. The quality is the issue. The other thing that really bather me the bother me the fact the pick up - I am definitely OK is slow pick for a 4 cylinder, but the ecoboost - it just jerks your head if you accelerate really slow during stop and go traffic(thankfully not request for)

lincoln,mkc,2015,retiredlt, 01/20/2015,Little Red,5,"I have had my 2.3 ruby red with hazelnut interior MKC for 6 weeks and 2400 miles and am very happy with it.  I have used the normal, comfort and sport modes but generally keep it in sport. The 2.3 has great power and I am averaging 19.8MPG with combination of city/highway driving. I first had to learn how to manage the gas pedal to avoid too rapid acceleration. The front seat comfort is outstanding and quality nearly perfect. Before buying, my 6'3"" 15 year old had to sit in the backseat to see if there was headroom and legroom.  With the front passenger seat somewhat forward and his seat reclining, there was no problem. The multitude of features and the THX stereo are superb! Go, Lincoln!

lincoln,mkc,2015,wywill, 03/10/2015,What a mistake!,2,"Purchased MKC Sat. 3/7.  Big mistake.  Spent more time on the phone with Lincoln than driving. Top of the line, every option available model.  1) Sirius said I don't have the 6 month trial period, Lincoln set up system wrong, had to pay for the first year immediately; 2) Sync Service wouldn't work, dealt for 3 hours with Lincoln on the phone to do all sorts of things to get the system to work correctly, 3)Lincoln phone app won't work, after 4 days still wants ""in car confirmation"" that I am the owner of the phone/car...their engineers are looking into it and should have an answer in 1 week.  What a Joke!  Do Not Buy this Car!  My 2014 Buick Lacrosse was flawless.  This is far from luxury!"
lincoln,mkc,2015,Doctor B, 03/31/2017,Great Luxury Crosssover for the price,5,"The supposedly outstanding customer service and overall ""Black Label"" experience is horrendously overrated, but the interior aesthetics of the vehicle options and bettter resale value make it almost worth it. There is room for improvement in the seat controls and lumbar support, but otherwise it is the most comfortable car I have ever had for long trips. It was also better than every other luxury car I test drove at cancelling out noise from the outside. MPG is not as great as it could be, and some of the interior finishes are made of junky plastic that can break or scratch easily, the storage compartment that exists in lieu of a traditional shift gear is poorly designed for ideal use, and it is easy to inadvertently hit the shift gear buttons---luckily my dogs can't reach the break pedal at the same time to shift from park, but they do often turn on the hazard lights if I leave them alone!
"
lincoln,mkc,2015,Bill'nJohn, 12/19/2017,Better than the Q5,5,"I was shopping for a used late model Audi Q5 but didnt want the black leather interior, which eliminates about 80% of the Q5s on the road.  We went to five different Audi dealers when we found used models with low miles and light colored interiors, and all five times we found out someone beat us to the purchase.  Meanwhile, we had driven the MKC and really liked it, but had our hearts set on the Audi.  After the 5th time of getting the door slammed in our face, we circled back to the MKC and bought it, it was a dealer demo model with the Reserve trim and all the bells and whistles.  I'm so glad we bought the MKC.  Performance wise, its very similar to the Q5, but it costs less and has more features.  I particularly like the way the SYNC3 system works so flawlessly.  I also like some of the ""little touches"" Lincoln added such as the illuminated welcome mat at night, the speedometer showing a small icon with the posted speed limit on it, and the multiple ports for device connectivity (which the Audi didn't offer).  The MKC looks great inside and out, is quiet and smooth behind the wheel, and our limited dealership experiences have been terrific.  Do yourself a favor and test drive this car before you buy an SUV from Audi, Acura, Volvo or BMW.

lincoln,mkc,2015,Deb A., 02/12/2016,AMAZING,5,"I sell Fords for a living we don't have the Lincoln franchise where I work when I knew that the Lincoln MKC was coming I knew I wanted one. I came from a 2013 Ford Escape SEL leather heated seats etc. with the 1.6 engine front wheel drive. That vehicle was wonderful and enjoyed it very much.  I wanted to have a little bit of bling in my life, so when my lease was up I went over to the Lincoln store and leased a MKC front wheel drive with the 2.0 engine. All I can say is WOW! leather heated seats, (and the seats are super comfortable), the new SYNC 3 is great user friendly,& remote start a big plus and it even comes in the base Model Lincoln. I live in Minnesota and went with the front wheel drive again. This vehicle rides nice and smooth, very quiet inside the cabin, heats up very well nice and toasty inside the vehicle. It must be do to the bigger engine going from a 1.6 eco boost to a 2.0 eco boost. Only Ford and Lincoln offer the eco boost engines another one of their trade marks fun and zippy and great fuel economy.  I love the remote start, the head lights are bright at night another WOW factor,  sync 3 the sound quality when making a hands free calls the clarity is outstanding, the seats are super comfortable. You never have to reach for your keys walk up to the door the vehicle knows you are approaching it and on the ground is the puddle light with the big Lincoln logo greeting upon entering your vehicle glowing at night time. Price point this starts where the Ford Escape Titanium ends. Fords do make Lincolns and this is their premier line up in addition to the Ford family. I love it so much I have had it for less than a week and have already put 170 miles on it. I could go on and on about how great of a vehicle this is from the ride, to the features to the comfort.  I have gotten many compliments on the MKC the girls in our dealership office all want one.

lincoln,mkc,2015,Mac JT, 08/15/2018,Lincoln's MKC mediocrity masked in mediocrity,2,"I leased this car for 3 years and on looking back I feel its money wasted. Lincoln's so called premium product is very ordinary. The doors were misaligned by almost 5"" , windows didnt close properly and the door handle was not properly secured to the door. There were loose screws everywhere and 1 week after taking it home the rattle was unbearable. Then came the gear shifter, they changed the sequence for safety reasons for which I had to take it back to the dealership. The mechanic didnt know how to change it as he wasnt trained, so i had to wait 2 weeks before i got the car back.  Once back the a/c stopped working and it took another 2 weeks to get that fixed. In my 3 years of driving this car there were 5 recalls, none of which the dealer informed me about. Everytime I asked they said there werent any parts or the recall wasnt serious enough. Final straw against EVER buying another Lincoln was the transmission, after year #2 it would jerk, stop and go and painfully you could feel the teeth meshing and shifting into gear. I informed the dealer of this and they quickly brushed it aside. The leather was plush, the instrumentation top class but the rear seat was a torture to get in and get out of. I wont buy another Lincoln ever again. For the same price you can get a Lexus or Acura, there is no way the MKC even comes close to competing with top class luxury.

lincoln,mkc,2015,wayne, 02/29/2016,Not up to date!!!,1,"If you plan on getting the Nav system understand it is out of date by at least a year or more and there is a 3 year or more gap in the updates.  Have had the car a week and 2 places could not be found 1 place was closed over a year and the school my son is enrolled in could not be found ( open since 1973 ). Contacted the Dealership and was told this chip was from 2014 and no update until 2017. Was told to look up the address on my computer or phone then input it into the Nav system. This is the best Lincoln can do, maybe this is why most people are buying other brands I know my next one will not be a Ford / Lincoln!

lincoln,mkc,2015,TAGS Fan, 05/27/2017,So Comfortable!,5,"My father was a Ford employee, so my dealer knows I can have the ""Z"" Plan price, and they are very accommodating. I was looking for front-seat comfort for my wife, and when I sat in the MKC, I knew I had found something she needed to see. She loved it! I've got 20K miles on it now, and it is the best car I've ever owned. The only issue I had was that this car sat on the lot for about 13 months, and the tires were ""flat"" from not being driven very much. I got such a great trade-in deal that I didn't mind taking those tires, and after 3K miles they rounded out and I've very satisfied. My wife has trouble staying awake in the passenger seat when we take long trips. What more can I say? I'd buy another one, for sure.

lincoln,mkc,2015,Dave, 03/10/2019,Great Compact SUV,5,"I really love the size of the MKC, makes driving enjoyable, steering wheel can actually be electrically positioned to where I like it, unlike other vehicles I have driven. The 285hp 2.3 Turbo is a great engine.  The adjustable suspension is usually set on Comfort which is necessary on Illinois roads, and rides much better than the late model Ford Escape, or other cars I have rented.  Compared to the 2018 Q5 I recently rented, there is no comparison. The Q5's terrible driver controls and hesitation of the engine, the lack of touch screen, and pathetic door locking procedures,  shouldn't allow it to be in same class as the Lincoln MKC.

lincoln,mkc,2016,Dan, 06/23/2016,Great Ride,5,"We were considering a 2017 Escape and then saw the MKC.  Great exterior styling that sets it aside from many of the other luxury brands that all tend to look alike. When we first drove the vehicle with the standard 2.0 Ecoboost, it felt like there was a V8 under the hood.  The interior is well laid out and has plenty of features.  Love the memory seats and mirrors and the power driver and passenger seating.   The touchscreen audio and climate controls work great.   I really was not sure we would care for the pushbutton tranny but it has turned out to be great and you lose the shifter.    The vehicle has some nice finishes and we opted for the expresso/sand interior with the zebra wood.   Plenty of storage room in the rear and the rear seats recline.  The only complaint would be the lack of leg room in the rear seat if he driver is tall.   The ride is firm and very quiet.   One surprise and delight feature was the Lincoln Welcome Mat.   When you unlock the doors, the Lincoln emblem and insignia is projected on both sides of the vehicle.   Clever!    We would definitely recommend this vehicle in the luxury SUV segment.

lincoln,mkc,2016,Willie the J, 06/24/2016,Great Ride,5,"My wife's Lincoln LS was 13 years old.  Time to replace it.  As a long time Audi and Prosche driver I looked at a Q5 and a Macan.  My local Lincoln dealer has always treated me fair so I decided to price an MkC.  The Lincoln dealership is less than 3 miles from my house.  The Porsche and Audi dealers are 35 miles away.Today there is a 2017 MkC AWD with the 2.3liter turbo 4 engine, 19"" wheels.  Is it an Audi or a Porsche?  No way, but it is close enough especially given the 5 figure price differences between and among them.The MkC is solid, scoots along rather well, runs on regular fuel, 4 year warranty.  First service is free and the dealer will come pick up the car, leave me a loaner, and return my serviced vehicle to me.  The fit and finish are first rate. The car has more technology than I will ever use.  Outward visibility front and to the sides is excellent.  Rear window is too small but that is how all these modern vehicles are designed.  Air bags everywhere.  No wind noise on the freeway.  All in all I am very satisfied with the MkC.
"
lincoln,mkc,2016,Harvey, 02/17/2017,From Convertible to SUV!,5,"I always drove convertibles. As I got older getting in and out became more challenging.  I drove a loaner SUV and  liked it in principle.  (BMW).  I decided to check out what was out there  in a smallish SUV. I tried Mercedes,Audi,Mazda, Honda and a few more. The result was I chose the The Lincoln  MKC. It was the  only one that I loved everything about it. The love affair continues after 8 months of ownership.
"
lincoln,mkc,2016,Iowa Driver, 08/13/2016,Very Solid Luxury Crossover with a Few Quirks,4,"I researched my purchase very carefully and test drove many comparable options, including BMW, Audi, Infinity, and Lexus.  Of those, I think this was very similar to the Audi Q5 in terms of feel, performance, styling, and quality.  Ultimately, I chose the MKC because I was able to order it with the colors and options I preferred, and Lincoln offered a number of incentives.  I not only got discounts on the purchase price, but also 0% financing!  It was a much better value (a steal really) compared to the foreign options.  And most of the foreign options all come in the same boring colors:  Black, white, silver, gray and red.  It is great to be able to go online, build your own car, and take those specs to the dealer.  I took these specs to several dealers and asked each for their best price.  I ordered my MKC in burgundy with the large spoke wheels...it is stunning!  I get a lot of compliments about this vehicle.  I will say however, that the bigger the wheels, the rougher the ride.  So far, no major complaints during my first 5000 miles.  Lincoln provides your initial service visits for free (2 years/24K miles).   My mileage is very consistently 20 mpg in town and 25 mpg on the highway (my driving style is middle of the road).  I was initially disappointed that they didn't offer a 6 cylinder, but I have found the 2.3 L turbo to be very responsive and powerful; certainly in the same wheelhouse with many of the 6 cylinders I drove.  I love the Sync 3 system; it's very easy to use and completely intuitive.  I also enjoy the modem in my car (comes with the Reserve package); it allows me to start my car remotely from any distance.  I can even set up an automatic start every day at a given time.  The car has a very upscale feel to it.  Very solid all the way through.  It has noise-canceling technology inside that makes it more quiet.  The push-button shifter is a little weird, but you quickly get used to it and it does allow more space in the console.  I really like the backup camera and side sensors that warn me if there is something in my blind spot.  Now...for the negatives:  My number one complaint is that I don't like the cruise control.  I'm assuming that this is a standard Ford product, but I've always been a Toyota guy and love their cruise control because it can be set easily with a flick of your middle finger without looking away from the road.  This Ford cruise control is awkward and always requires me to look down to use it.  Also, the wiper controls are upside down compared to Toyota.  And sometimes when you drive with windows or sunroof open, you can get a lot of unpleasant wind pressure and vibration inside.  The back seat is tight for bigger people, but this is partly due to styling (sloped roof).    The process for closing the hood is (unnecessarily) tricky; I had to practice it several times to get it to work.  Also, had a couple of minor quality issues:  Some passengers claim they hear air whistling by the window on the highway (I'm deaf to higher pitch noise, and don't hear it).  The glove compartment is coated with a fuzzy material that sheds and sticks to the owner's manual.    The leather and wood on the inside is great, but some of the chrome buttons/dials seem a little cheap.  I like having body side moldings to prevent door dings, but Lincoln doesn't offer it (as Toyota does).  However, I did find an aftermarket product that looks great and works well.   Lastly, I am proud to be driving a vehicle that is made right here in the USA!   NOTE:  The review's drop-down box did not offer me the option of 2.3 liter turbo, but that is my engine size.

UPDATE:  I’m now at 16k miles and two years.   Overall, I’m happy with the vehicle. However, I’ve had a couple issues with the interior:  First, there is a rattle in the speaker cover on the dash that the dealer can’t seem to fix. Secondly, my drivers seat heater/cooler
 doesn’t work in spite of dealer changing it out. Also, have started to realize that back seat is really cramped, partly due to panoramic moonroof.  You have to be pretty small to fit back there. Lastly, my front air vent came apart but was fixed under warranty.  Mechanically, it has been excellent.  I do wish the vehicle had a bigger gas tank, especially on long trips.

UPDATE:  I’m now at 30k miles and 3 years. It still runs and drives very well. But the rattle/vibration in the driver side speaker cover on top of the dash is worse than ever and still not fixed in spite of multiple visits to Ames Ford.  I’m going to try a different dealership. If they can’t fix it, then this will be my first and last Ford product. It’s a shame because overall the car looks beautiful and drives so well. Love the acceleration. But I can’t handle the rattling much longer. If it isn’t fixed by the time my warranty is done, then I’m going back to Lexus.

Update:  Deery Lincoln in Iowa City finally fixed my rattle. Now I love my vehicle more than ever. I’m even thinking about ordering a new one!

lincoln,mkc,2016,Bob, 02/16/2019,Great Value as a CPO purchase but having problems,2,"For a used certified car it is a great value.  I got the 2.3L which gives a little more punch.  Gas milage is around 22 typical.  Highway is 26-27.  The Sync 3 system is great and the software can be updated to support Apple Carplay.  The THX system is a disappointing.   The bass is muddy and the sound settings cannot be accessed directly from the audio screen. You have to go back to settings main screen.    Ride comfort is great and quiet.  The ambient night time lighting are great.  I have the a couple of problems.  A dash rattle in cold weather, key phob problem opening the door, and rust has started in the door jams.   Lincoln is taking care of the issues.  Overall like the car over the Honda CRV and BMW X5.   Great value if bought as a CPO.

Update at 15 months- Known problem with lug nuts not warranted by Lincoln.  They used cheap metal and the lug nuts swell so the lug wrench does not fit or does any socket.   I had to replace them myself by hammering a socket on the lug to remove it.   The cruise control has failed and is going into the shop next week.  This is the first America car I have purchased in over 20 years and disappointed with the reliability.  Electrical gremlins continue and rattles have started at 50K miles.   I will be going back to Toyota if they fix their ugly grills otherwise it will be a Honda.

lincoln,mkc,2016,Mica, 08/27/2016,Wife's new MKC Select,4,"We considered many vehicles before buying the MKC. This is a very nice car for the money.  I was looking for a dampening of road noise. Wife was looking for comfortable front seat, ease of access to features, and a fun drive. She got her wants. This car is very noisy for my likes!  We owned 6 Lincolns in the past and quit the brand when Ford forgot to build luxury in.   Thought we'd try again.  We found great, knowledgeable, salespeople but, if I have a complaint, it is that their dealership does not reflect the ""high end"" ownership experience of a Mercedes or even an Audi dealership.  Found this to be true at other Lincoln dealers we also visited, so must assume that it it the marque that does not recognize the value of a ""high end"" experience when you are trying represent your vehicle as an alternative to Mercedes, BMW, etc.
UPDATE:  one year and 6000 miles on - this vehicle is very noisy on the road for an expensive luxury car!  My F 150 has less road noise.  Dealer looked at it - said it was in specs.  Had a local car upholstery shop add more insulation to doors and floor - BIG help.  So why can THEY do it and Lincoln cannot? 
UPDATE 2: two years on 9500 miles - vehicle still too noisy for me - wife says it's OK (and it IS her car!) The fix by the local upholstery shop helped (You'd think Lincoln would have done this in the first place!). Gas mileage in town not so great for a 4 cyl., but it does jump when the turbo kicks in.
UPDATE 3: three years on 15000 miles - vehicle still too noisy for me (my F 150 has less road noise) - Wife says it's OK (and it IS her car!) The fix by the local upholstery shop was a big help tho. Again- gas mileage in town not so great for a 4 cyl., but it does jump when the turbo kicks in.  Overall combined mpg unimpressive.
UPDATE 4: three years 7 months - with 22000 miles. Car seems to get noisier with age!  Had some computer issues so dealer gave us a new 2020 Corsair as a loaner.  Same car as ours with a few updates.  Nice BUT nearly as noisy.  Wife and daughter took a 1000 mile trip in our MKC just recently and NOW they are convinced that it IS too noisy.  Will be shopping for a new car soon, but alas, NOT another Lincoln!

lincoln,mkc,2016,Ann, 03/06/2019,MKC is a keeper,5,"Let me start by saying that I'm the type of person who owns her vehicles for a long time. I'm in my mid 30's, and have found the MKC very attractive from the moment I noticed them. I knew it was time for a replacement and I needed a small SUV. I began test driving SUVs about 4 months ago; from A to the Z. Cadillac SRx, Hyundai, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Infinity... but at the end of the day, there was something missing. I wasn't satisfied with the comfort, acceleration, or overall look of the vehicle. I was really running out of hope, when I decided to try the Lincoln MKC. The moment I sat on it and drove it off the lot for my first test drive, I was convinced this was the one. Not only it drove like I was on cloud 9, but the acceleration, features, gas mileage, comfort, and design were all combined in 1. It does not feel like I'm driving a 4 cylinder car; It feels like a regular V6. What an amazing feeling, to finally find everything you need in one vehicle. I couldn't be any happier with my purchase. My only complaint is the lack of leg room for the second row seat. Besides that, the vehicle is perfect in my opinion. I was even having a conversation with my fiancee discussing how my next vehicle will be another Lincoln.

lincoln,mkc,2016,Brian, 03/13/2016,Better than a bmw or benz.,5,"2016 lincoln mkc reserve 2.3 awd.
The car is great. My sticker price was $47,446. I got some rebates and 1.9 financing. I could have bought a bmw, benz or audio for this price with less options. Bmw has no touch screens. Just a stupid knob. The car gets 5mpg better than what it says, after break in.
I own a business and have a fleet of 16 vehicles and I have driven all of them. The fords hold up much better than other brands. I drive this car myself. 3 weeks old and 6,234 miles already. I even have used it a few times to drive passengers around for uber!! Great ride, no road noise. Seat is so compy it's crazy good. Buy the car! No complaints at all! And I'm very picky.

lincoln,mkc,2016,Tim G, 11/27/2018,This SUV packs a punch for the buck,5,"I leased a 2016 Select AWD 2.0, and put on 36,000 miles without a single issue or need for repair. Just changed oil and rotated tires per service, about $70 each time and under 1 hour. My only gripes are- the front seats dont adjust as much I prefer, I am 5'10 and 190lbs, so average. The telescoping wheel also could use another inch down, and outward. The gas mileage average was 24MPG, and I drive pretty spirited and in Sport Mode often. Thats it. I liked it so much, that I just leased a 2019, as Lincoln will make your last 3 payments if you trade to new lease. So I leased a Select Plus (Cross Blind Spot/Navigation) for a bit more than the 2016, but residuals on the lease have changed a lot, and there are not as many incentives on leases for this modem like 2016. I looked at a Audi Q5, Benz GLC, BMW X3. The best of that bunch IMO was the Audi Q5, but with options/leases, they are 40% more to lease. I also dont like the cost of repairs should I have a issue not under warranty, German cars are $$$ to fix. Had a BMW and a Benz in last 10 years.

lincoln,mkc,2016,Gary's MKC, 01/11/2020,Love my MKC,5,"I bought this as a Lincoln Certified used car.  It still had 7 months remaining in the factory warranty before the certified warranty kicks in.  The car is fun to drive as it handles more like a car than an SUV.  I love the design, both inside and out.  I've taken several long trips and it's very comfortable and not tiring at all after being on the road for many hours.  Plus, my highway fuel mileage (30 - 32) has been better than the EPA estimates.  City fuel mileage has been spot on with EPA as I've been getting 19 -21.  Overall, I love the features and the comfort.  Very quiet car too."
lincoln,mkc,2016,Vikki from Enola, 03/04/2020,I Love my car,5,"I love my 2016 MKC Reserve that I bought used last March. It is just the right size to fit in my garage and to drive. It has all the amenities I want. I love the rear hands-free lift gate, the leather interior, auto off & on high beams, the heated steering wheel and sitting up higher in the SUV as opposed to sitting lower in a sedan, the rear camera and the welcome/security lights when approaching my vehicle. I feel good knowing I have the all wheel drive incase of a heavy snow. The only option I don't use is the cooled seats. I use the heated seats but not the cooled seats. The gas mileage is OK. In the summer I was getting 25 MPG but in the winter I am getting 23.7. Must be all the additives they add in the winter that lowers my MPG. Again I am very happy with my 2016 MKC. There are other options included in this vehicle which I appreciate and too numerous to mention. I just mentioned the ones I LOVE!!!!"
lincoln,mkc,2016,Jereac65, 04/30/2018,The Health Of Sir Collinn,3,"I have only driven the vehicle 7994 Miles in mostly clear weather. I can not honestly make a sound evaluation of the vehicle in that it is too soon to do so.  What I can say is that the passenger cabin is well appointed but tight. The power conversion pod in the back seat area keeps popping out and had to be replaced. I noticed an oil leak from underneath the engine compartment at about six thousand miles. I discovered, after taking the vehicle to the dealership, that the leak was caused by  a loose oil filter. At nearly 13K miles, Sir Collinn has preformed well. No repairs done other than the power outlet in the rear seat area and a punctured right front tire. The acceleration is great for a four cylinder. The noise level over bumps can be annoying. The THX stereo is equal to or greater than the Bose system I had in my previous vehicle.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Charles W, 01/19/2017,Great Addition to the Lincoln Line,5,"As another reviewer's title says, ""This is not your grandpa's Lincoln.""  I thought that when I first test drove one, and I would have used the title here if it hadn't already been used.  I have been a Ford product owner since my first new car, and this is my eighth new car.  I traded in my 2002 Eddie Bauer Explorer with almost 250,000 miles on it for the MKC.  I wanted something a bit smaller with better gas mileage while offering quality.  I will say that I always said I'd never spend more than $35,000 on a car, but the MKC Reserve certainly stickered for substantially more.  However, I believe that for the price and from a comparison standpoint, the MSRP is not out of line.  The fit and finish on the vehicle is outstanding, and I've had a number of compliments on the car from passersby.  People really like to comment on my kicking under the rear to open the rear hatch.  People also love the welcome lighting in the car.  I've had the car for one year and 4 months, and I can honestly say it has exceeded my expectations.  I've read reviews from individuals and ratings companies (e.g., magazine editors) that the mileage estimates are way off.  I have to say that is not my experience.  Other ratings I've seen in some reviewers were actually lower than I expected.  At speeds from 65 to 73 on the highway, I've actually hit 34+ mpg.  That's better than the highway mpg on the window sticker.  So, this is definitely good mileage.  And with over 19,000 miles on the car now, the average mileage since I've owned it has averaged 24.6 miles.  I love BLIS, adaptive cruise control, the heated and cooled seats (cooled are going to be very important in the southern heat), the My Lincoln app, extremely comfortable seats, active park assist and other options.  I joke that I actually had to read the manual to learn how to use the car.  Oh, and I can't forget the push button start and remote functions, including starting from my phone.  And speaking of the phone, my iPhone works great with SYNC 3.  Bluetooth works well, voice recognition is great, and the nav system is handy - I had no desire to get the nav system, but it came with the package, and I actually use it to see what traffic is like when going to and from work.  And the THX optional sound system is outstanding - it's a new way to listen to my music!  After 1 year and 4 months and 19,000 miles, I still find no negative issues with the car.  Burgundy velvet with the ebony interior is a great combination, too.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Stan Man the Lincoln Fan, 01/30/2018,"Gives BMW, Audi, Lexus a run for their money",5,"My husband and I bought our MKC to replace his rapidly aging luxury car, which gracefully lived a long, garage-kept life for 15+ years. Since the MKC's were released, my husband had his eye on them... he loved the exterior styling. We considered the BMW X3, Audi Q3 and Lexus NX, and were completely and pleasantly surprised when we test drove the MKC. Official reviews touted that the MKC was just a ""re-badged Ford Escape"" and I can tell you, this is nothing like an Escape. Far, far from it. We purchased the 2017 MKC Reserve AWD with the Tow, Technology and Climate Packages. The technology in this is amazing - we're in our mid-30's and were just shocked as to all it can do! The Sync3 system is intuitive and responsive, and we love that it works with our Android and iPhones. All of the safety features like BLIS with cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist, radar cruise control, ect, is a huge help, but some of those annoying features can be turned off (which we liked). One thing we didn't think we'd appreciate as much as we do is the comfort. I love the BMW and Audi's performance, but the MKC is so, so quiet and comfortable without really sacrificing responsiveness. The noise and roughness is one thing I really didn't like in the BMW. The heated/cooled seats, and heated steering wheel are a huge plus. We live in the Northeast, and can say this has been excellent and solid when driving in the snow or poor weather conditions. The panoramic sunroof is great too; probably the nicest feature, I'd say. My father even like the sleek design and the interior quality... and he's owned nothing but BMW and Lexus for ages. The sounds system could be a little better; seems a little ""blah"" to me. But I would say that so far, this is my only complaint. This is by far one of this nicest, best vehicles either of us has owned so far. We bought an excellent vehicle for the price and as long as Lincoln keeps this up, we'll be long-term customers.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Craig, 04/03/2017,A Good Alternative to German and Japanese Models,4,"Coming out of an Audi Q5, the MKC is a pleasant surprise.  Professional reviews of it have been mixed.  While some of the criticisms are valid, most are not.  On the plus side, the interior materials are every bit as good as the Germans and Japanese.  MKC's leather is superior to the Q5's base leather.  If anything is lacking inside, it's not the materials, it's the aesthetic design.  Lincoln needs to get a bit more creative in that regard to match the Europeans.  I'm not crazy about the center stack design, though it's better in person that in pics. The exterior design is best in class except arguably the Macan in my opinion.  Many reviews claim the MKC is slow compared to competitors, but it certainly doesn't feel it.  My 2.0 MKC feels just as fast as my Q5 2.0 did.  Ultimately, the MKC is let down by its downmarket 6 speed transmission, which results in acceleration and mileage disadvantages compared to the 7, 8, and 9 speeds common in the class (RSX & NX still make due with 6 speeds as well).  A transmission with 2 more gears would even up the score.  The AWD model will pull .83g on a skidpad.  That's right there with the Benz's .83g & Audi's .85g, so handling is competitive.  If you want a small SUV that drives like a sports car, the BMX X3 or Porsche Macan are for you.  Most people don't need that though.  The features for the money is incredible.  On the minus side, the backseat is uninhabitable by anyone with legs if you're sitting behind a 6 footer like me.  Lincoln has to do a better job on the packaging. Also the driver left footrest is oddly shaped and not big enough for someone with larger feet.  The view out the back is also not so great, but that's common in these newer designs with higher beltlines.  Lastly, the optional 2.3 engine didn't feel any quicker than the 2.0, making it not worth its $1k cost in my opinion.  Other than the tight rear seat, these are minor quibbles.  Try to option up a X5,  Q5 or GLC similarly to a Reserve MKC and you'll spend about $6k more - same goes for the Black Label.  One could argue these German vehicles are better - but certainly none are $6k better.  And some of them don't offer all the tech the MKC has at any price.  The RSX is blah and soulless, the Macan and Evoque are horribly overpriced, and the NX is just plain ugly with underwhelming equipment options.  That all adds up to Lincoln having a credible competitor in this class.  Final thought for all those complaining about poor mileage.  New cars typically have poor mileage during the engine break in period - especially turbo engines.  It'll get better after the first few hundred miles.

lincoln,mkc,2017,MkC Driver, 08/04/2016,2017 MkC,5,"My wife's car was due for replacement.  Having owned 4 Audis and 5 Porsches over the last 40+ years, our first stops were to look at the Audi Q5 and Porsche Macan.  Fine vehicles by any standard and no doubt, worth their price.  But my closest P/A dealerships are 30+ miles away. And then there is the cost of routine maintenance.  Even if it is only once or twice a year the bills do add up. Stopped by our local Lincoln dealer.  Family-owned operation, not a mega-dealer.Drove a 2016 MkX and a 2017 MkC.  Bought the C.  AWD, 2.3 liter turbo 4, 19"" wheels and a whole bunch of other stuff. More technology than I will ever need or want.  Quiet, solid.  No wind noise at 75mph.  The 2.3 liter has more than enough low end grunt and can run all day at 80mph.Lincoln is certainly trying to up their game.  Call for service and the dealer comes to your house or place of business, drops off a loaner and takes your vehicle in for service.  Your vehicle gets, serviced, washed and returned to you.  Not a bad deal.  Is the MkC comparable to a Q5 or Macan?  Not really.  But I have an extremely competent smaller SUV that cost between $10k and $20k less than its German counterparts, not counting the service cost differential.  My one complaint is that those 19"" diameter 45 series tires are not the friendliest on the oxen trails that pass for roads in my state.

lincoln,mkc,2017,SYFer, 07/27/2017,Very Pleased,5,"I wanted a luxury crossover with great tech (Apple Car Play was a must-have), a comfortable, quiet ride for my brutal Silicon Valley commutes and great design (other musts: leather, camera, large format sunroof). I also wanted a reasonable value for all that. My finalists were the BMW X series (probably X1 or X3), the Mercedes GLA and the MKC. In the end, it's obvious that if I wanted the German nameplate cache, it was going to cost significantly more (5-10K) to get what I could get in a the far more reasonably priced Lincoln. I took the savings and extended the warranty (which I always do on a new car) and I purchased the Premium Maintenance Package (which I've never done) because Lincoln's Concierge/Valet service (which is standard--not part of the pkg) makes ongoing maintenance and service an incredible value. All I need to do is contact the  Lincoln concierge via the App, web or call and on the day of my service appt, the valet comes out to my home or office with an equal or better Lincoln and brings mine back when its done. This is not only insanely convenient (I got to try it recently when Lincoln corrected a minor part issue I identified at purchase), but it will ensure that I am punctual and on schedule for my regular service which is always challenging with my work, doing the dealer shuttle, etc. I won't likely even set foot in the dealership for a few years now. As for the ride, performance, comfort, etc., I'm completely satisfied on all counts and I really do love the lines, stance and overall design of this car. In fact, it's kind of funny, now that I'm out there in the Lincoln amidst all the other people driving exactly the same 4 or 5 Germans (and the ubiquitous suburban moms in Subarus), I'm kind of liking the contrarian Lincoln luxury SUV statement. I've never been more satisfied with a new car purchase. One other thing, my Lincoln dealer has been great and they have clearly made a serious commitment to making the Lincoln experience as VIP and upscale as possible. All said, an amazing value for money.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Bonnie, 08/28/2016,I LOVE it,5,"We purchased a 2017 MKC in July and we LOVE it.  We have the 2.0 engine, which provides great acceleration and good fuel economy (21.1 mpg).  The interior is totally quiet and interior touches like the real wood trim, leather seats, and the stitching on the steering wheel and dash add to the elegant feel.  The touch screen is convenient and very easy to use without having to refer to the owner's manual all the time.  I can even choose the type of ride - sport, normal, or comfort (my favorite).  The doors have a nice solid feel when you close them and the vehicle just looks and rides very classy.

I've had this vehicle for slightly over one year now and I still LOVE it.  I've had absolutely no problems with it at all.  It's a good looking vehicle that is great to drive.

After owning this vehicle for more than two years I still LOVE it and would rate it 5 stars in all the categories above.  I've had absolutely NO problems of any kind with it.  I love driving it and would purchase another Lincoln MKC without hesitation.

We've owned this vehicle for 3 years now and have 30,822 miles on it.  We've had absolutely NO problems/repairs needed.  I LOVE my Lincoln MKC.   I'd buy another Lincoln again without hesitation.

Still love our MKC after more than 37,000 miles.   It's been the perfect vehicle - absolutely NO problems or repairs needed.  We'd buy another without hesitation.

Car rides beautifully and is extremely quiet on the inside.  Gas millage so far is around 20, for an AWD that's not bad considering the weight of the car.  All of the controls are easy to use and figure out.  Car does shift a little odd at times but did read that's a problem with Ford products.

lincoln,mkc,2017,MKC Convert, 10/13/2016,Definitely not my Grandpa's Lincoln!,5,"This gem of an SUV caught my eye at the March car show. I owned an Acura RDX and was in the market for a new SUV.  I was actually planning to buy another RDX, but the MKC on display in the Ford/Lincoln section begged a closer look. Lincoln offered a $75.00 gift card to schedule a test drive at a later date, so that's exactly what I did.  I was sold on the Lincoln once I drove the model with the continuous dampening control drive system. I'll admit it took a little while to get past the ""old fogey"" label associated with Lincoln. Once I did, however, it became a matter of finding the right color combination in a Reserve trim level WITH the drive control system.  Three months later, I bought my new MKC.  It rides like a dream and is absolutely gorgeous, both inside and out.  The only true annoyance is the lack of a real tire pressure monitoring system (you know, the one that tells you the tire pressure in each tire).  The indicator light recently flashed a low tire pressure warning, but unlike my RDX (and recent Hyundai rental), that was all the information I got. No fun trying to locate my tire pressure gauge and figure out which tire had the problem IN THE DARK. Hopefully Ford will consider adding a true TPMS to its vehicles in the future.

The ride is amazingly smooth.  I went for the 2.0 as I didn't need the turbo 2.3 effect to go to work every day.  It really feels like a luxury car and meets my expectations.  The dealership was very nice and the service that comes with this car is super convienant since I work all the time.  It's the reserve AWD model and really is a nice and quiet drive.  I just bought the car so I can't speak to it's maintenance, but let me tell you, it feels comfortable, leather is nice and the color is spot on with a luxurious feel.  I love this car more than I ever thought I would considering I was looking at other luxury cars that were more pricer with less features.   Try the lincoln before the others, it changed my mind when I sat in the car and gave it a test drive.  The back seats and cargo is not the most comfortable for a larger family, but that is what the MKX is for if that is what you need.  For my husband and I,this is a perfect car.

lincoln,mkc,2017,PS, 03/01/2019,New to MKC ownership,5,"Updated review after driving 23+K miles in 1 yr of ownership:
I moved to upstate NY shortly after purchasing the car last spring and absolutely LOVE the heated steering wheel & seats.  The remote start (key fob and phone app) is a God-send : )  The AWD and a new set of Goodyear WeatherReady tires make navigating the snow a breeze (note: I don't live in a hilly area).  I've also changed my mind about possibly moving to an MKX (name changed to Nautilus for 2020).  The shorter wheelbase makes it fun to drive and the 2.0 Turbo has great low-end acceleration.  When I brought it in for a service, the loaner I got was a 2020 Nautilus with AWD, 20"" wheels and a V6.  Compared with my MKC, it seemed sluggish in acceleration and had a lot more body lean when cornering.    Don't get me wrong, the Nautilus is a luxury vehicle but I love the smaller version especially with the choice of Comfort mode gives it just as a smooth ride - very important for all the rough roads and potholes up here in the NE.  BTW, I'm still waiting for my invite to go out for a beer with McConaughey, lol.

Original review: 
I just bought a 2 yr old 2017 MKC reserve w/ 2.0, AWD, climate and technology packages.  It's certified pre-owned and I was shocked when I learned that Lincoln automatically extends the comprehensive warranty from the typical 4yr / 50K mi to 6 yr / 100K mi.  I love the buttery smooth & quiet ride and all the technology goodies.  I also love the sleek lines and modern styling.  I'm not sure why some say that the interior is not luxury.  I have only 2 issues:  1) The seats take at least 5 min to heat up.  The XT5 seats warm up in <2 min and the Mazda CX-5 in 30 sec (I rented both recently).   2) The small cargo space.  Granted, I just traded in a Highlander that I drove for over 10 years and am going through a downsizing adjustment, the cargo area is a bit disappointing.  I wish they had extended the rear a couple more inches to at least be similar in size to the Rav4 or CRV.  But, now that I'm single and kids are not in the equation, I don't really need a Highlander-sized SUV.  Having said that, I do wish they would have included more storage up front (change/chapstick/dental floss holder) & some side pockets on the console.  In the back seat, it would have been nice to have a better fold down console and wider seat pockets on the back of the front seats.  My Highlander had ones just wide and deep enough to completely conceal my 12"" MacBook Air and the MKC's leave about 1/3 of it sticking out.  I'll explore storage options on Amazon but may end up going with an MKX after it's all said and done if I can't get used to the smaller cargo area.  However, I will definitely get a certified pre-owned vehicle from now own.  As for my subjective rating,  beyond the size/storage & slow seat warming (which I'd give it 3.5 stars), I absolutely love the vehicle and give the rest of it 4.9 stars.  Overall, I give it 4.2 stars.
"
lincoln,mkc,2017,Ken, 01/05/2017,Ok first we leased 2 of them both Reserves,4,"First a background on what was being replaced and current driven vehicles. 2015 CTS coupe (lease coming to an end), 640 BMW convert. (lease coming to an end) and a 328 4 door. My background on vehicles driven primarily in the last few years involves a H2 Hummer, and the above vehicles with daily drivers usually being a coupe. I started to test drive many new vehicles and was not set on a small SUV. I have recently had 2 Infiniti coupe leases a convertible and a plain coupe (loved both) Then I test drove the new ""red sport"" coupe with twin turbos can I just say WOW! Perfect car for me but they quotes were insane for a car in that class at just under 800 a month so it was off list. Drove the Porsche Macan S and can I say right here and now it was hands down one of the best cars I have ever driven. I have owned a Cayman S and a Ferrari recently (yep love cars) and the Macan S was as fun and tight as anything I could compare it to, it beat! However the reality check came when the lease quote was at 1150 Mo for a 74k car and it seemed of by a long shot since I paid the same on a 98k 640 convert (made no sense to me) So what the heck I drove the Infiniti SUV's and ended up in a Lincoln showroom after reading some reviews. Turns out my daughter was also thinking of what car to get next and she wanted a bit more room like a small SUV could provide. I do not want to drive a  car without the latest safety and tech features since I really enjoy them. The MKC size seemed to be right for both of us and ended up ordering 2 of them both Reserves in white. Very pleased overall in vehicles. Quiet (not as quiet as many would have you believe) Nice look and features. Fast for a tiny 4 cyl turbo. BUT and a big but here, this was my first front wheel drive car for both of us other than rentals. Huge change when you step on the gas and have to hold the wheel when passing to keep control, it feels like driving a go cart. Love all the features on the car and still have not had been brave enough to test the self parking assist. Ok now the down side of this nice lil SUV. Both cars for us are getting HORRIBLE mileage (worse than my caddi and everything but my Hummer H2! I would have never ever got two of these if I knew the mileage numbers were going to be this bad! 17-19 combined driving for both vehicles! I was conservatively estimating 22 combined, nope, nada no way. The next very irritating thing to me is the rear and front bumper proximity alarms, they suck! You cannot adjust sensitivity and are basically useless since you have to be very close to get the beep. (cross traffic alert works great) Next irritating thing to me is the Apple car play, you really cannot use any apps you want ( I use only WAZE for navigation and it will not work on the car system. Next is the navigation, just plain difficult to set to make it easy to read and the worst out of any system I currently have or have had. Next the voice commands seem to have too many steps to get to where you want to be. Overall the vehicle is good, motor and transmission have been bullet proof and has many nice features but I was deeply disappointed in the MPG and irritated with the crash avoidance system (completely useless at low speeds)but will alert you at higher speeds (but not stop the car). Even though we are located in Miami I am glad I got the heated rear seats it is great when someone is use to it. All of the small features have been reviewed many times such as the hands free lift gate something you don't think about until your hands are full! My eldest daughter drives a Rover and saw that feature and now she wants a SUV with it (makes sense for moms with kids and all the accessories)  For me when I get another vehicle I feel anything out there now should get over 20MPG and as I get older I felt it was going to be my benchmark and I would never buy a car that averaged under 20 (hopefully
 24) MPG not as an economic issue buy more like supporting companies that are progressive and responsible and this is why I was very disappointed on the mileage issue. I do not see how you could go wrong with this vehicle when you compare vehicles based on quality and price.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Car Man, 02/04/2017,Perfect Except for Mileage,4,"We love the car after 5 weeks, but the gas mileage is really poor. We are lucky if we get 17 combined.  Its hard to believe that its this low. I drive a 2011 BMW 535Xi and drive it hard and get 23+.  Lincoln needs to work on this for next versions. Other than this, would highly recommend the 2017 MKC.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Iris DeCastro, 09/14/2017,Best car EVER!,5,"I love this car.  Sync makes everything easy, accessing phones, reading text messages out loud, navigation.  But the Reserve is all about luxury.  This car feels like an expensive car.  My parents have Lexus and Acura SUVs and the MKC is much more comfortable.
"
lincoln,mkc,2017,L. Joseph Thomas, 12/24/2018,Great for Singles and Couples,4,"This is a beautiful car with many popular tech features that would cost much more in other luxury compact SUVs.  It is definitely not a family friendly vehicle or a vehicle for those who frequently transport back seat passengers, as the rear seating areas are extremely confining, especially for taller or larger passengers.  I also do not recommend this vehicle for those who drive more than 10-12,000 miles a year because the gas mileage leaves a lot to be desired.  That said, this is a very stylish  car that a high  level safety and comfort.  As a heavyset  man in my senior years with arthritis, my paramount concern is having a vehicle that I can in and out of easily without having to squeeze into the car, climb up, of get down to far into.   This is just perfect in that respect for me.   Another important feature for me personally is that the navigation system does not require me to have my smartphone on.  I traded in my previous Toyota Camry because the Navigaton system required me to use my smartphone with a serious of apps installed, and also had to be connected with a USB cable if I wanted maps with my directions.  To add insult to injury, the car salesman never told me this until I purchased the car.  What's the point of spending thousand of dollars extra for a  navigation system if I can't use it without my phone? I love my new 2018 Lincoln MKC, and I will never buy another vehicle except for one thing.  I can't stand the new front grill on the 2019s.  The ""fishnet"" design, as I call it, totally destroys the elegance and overall beauty of this stunning vehicle.  Hopefully, in 5 years or so when I am ready to trade mine in for a new MKC, Lincoln will have come to their senses and at least offer an option for the grill design.

Family has always driven Lincolns, Mercurys, and Fords. Was also looking at Ford Edges and Escapes. fully loaded (which was a must) were almost as much as the MKC. Plus the MKC had a shorter wheelbase. I love that.Gas mileage isn't bad as I do both freeway and ""in town"" driving averaging around 19 mpg, which in CA is very important.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Mick, 07/26/2018,Luxurious Ride,5,"We looked at the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX and the MKC. We were sold on the compact size and the responsiveness of the steering. We love this car. The Edge was a little bigger than we wanted and the same for the MKX. If you are looking for a roomy backseat this may not be for you. It’s a little tight but for us it’s fine. We have taken it on trips and the seats are very comfortable. The only issue we find sometimes is when using the voice command there is problems understanding my command. Probably due to my southern accent. The navigation is great. I am updating this to state Lincoln wanted $100 plus to update the map. I think in the future navigation will be done mostly on people’s phones and you won’t find it as much in autos. It handles curves very well and is fun to drive. Ours was a bigger engine with the 2.3L Turbo. A lot of power and excellent acceleration. When changing gears from drive to reverse there is a slight lag in response but we got used to it. Overall the interior is excellent and the road noise is a minimum. After driving this now for 3 years and riding in various other small compact vehicles, this Lincoln has excellent ride quality in comparison. We have had this now for 3 years and still enjoy it. I do think the interior design is good but wish the front cup holders had been side by side instead of front and back. The overhead controls for the sunroof are difficult to see but you learn which ones do certain functions. Maybe should have angled those to see them better. There is plenty of space for us with just two people and have taken several trips now. Gets about 23-24 mpg on the highway and a lot of city stop and go driving will get you anywhere from 17-19 mpg. If you have back seat passengers a lot it is a bit tight getting in and out of but again you get used to it. We rarely sit there and only occasionally have passengers. There have been some minor repair with the trim and battery replacement, head rest replacement due to the upholstery in it peeling, seat heater issue and an electronic board used with the Lincoln app. If it had not been under warranty it could have been costly. There have not been any majors repairs since those were done. The Greeneville, TN dealership has been great and would highly recommend them. Excellent maint department. After owning this suv for 3 years now we are still enjoying it. The minor issues that we have had while under warranty have been resolved and there has not been anymore. We do enjoy all the technology but mostly just the ride and luxury interior. Again the vehicle fits us fine. If you need something with a lot of cargo room you can let the seats down. If you have back seat passengers a lot you would need to look at a different vehicle as this is tight for leg room. We average 20-21 mpg overall. That does include a mix of a lot of city driving and highway. If you’re in the city only it will drop to 19-20 and on the highway on a trip we get 24-25 mpg. We are now just a bit over 3 years of ownership. The dealership we purchased this from is not a Lincoln dealer anymore due to very low sales. We have switched to Rockytop Lincoln in Sevierville for our service needs. It’s on the husbands way to work. Even though the old dealership still serviced Lincoln’s that were purchased there we prefer one who still sells them. I will say the dealership in Sevierville stated they were not set up to include the car washes, pickup and delivery but they would take the spouse on to work if needed. The service department also stated they did not have a loaner at the time to drop it off for an oil change and tire rotation. The point is even though Lincoln advertises as a selling point the idea of pickup, delivery and loaners, it’s rare the dealerships have the ability to do just that.

Since then I have owned/leased eight different models.  Although I prefer the Continentals for their extravagant technology, my age and physical limitations limit me to the SUVs. Since I wish to be more environmental friendly, the MKC is the logical choice. This is the last gift to myself in the twilight of my life.

lincoln,mkc,2017,LisaF, 12/21/2016,It's just OK!,3,"If you have your phone using the Car Play, you cannot use the navigation on the vehicle. It makes you use your Maps on your phone. The SIRI is horrible for the phone. If you are trying to call someone it doesn't always work correctly. So all in all, you cannot use your phone for a phone call if you want to use the autos navigation. Also, there isn't a heat vent near the driver's door. When the heat is on, it's freezing on that side of your legs. This is literally the worst car I have ever leased. The car does not have a great turn radius. All of my other vehicles, and I have had some very nice vehicles, they can turn on a dime. This one, no chance. The AWD is terrible in the snow and slides all over the place. The gas mileage is the worst I have ever had. I cannot get over 20 mpg. I am so disappointing with this SUV. If I wanted something this cheap, I would have gone with the regular Edge.

lincoln,mkc,2017,Josh, 07/07/2018,Systemic AC ISSUE,1,"This is the second MKC that I've owned. I own the 2015 Reserve trim MKC. I ended up trading in that car because I had a similar issue with the air conditioner that I'm having with my black label trim car right now. so the problem is that the AC will randomly blow hot air on the driver side and cold air on the passenger side. I end up having to close the vents on the driver side to keep the hot air from blowing in my face. Again the 2015 MKC that I had did the same thing so I traded it. To have this problem in a $56, 000 car is completely unacceptable. this is the second chance that I have given to Lincoln and I regret it. I traded in a 2017 CX-5 fully loaded and now I feel like I made a mistake. I hope that someone from Lincoln will hear this read this and address this issue. It doesn't make sense that I'm 2018 a car manufacturers selling a $56, 000 car has an issue with the AC working as it should. I will never buy another Lincoln product ever again I am done. I am all for American car manufacturers I grew up a Ford lover but I can no longer accept these substandard quality as compared to other car manufacturers especially when I'm spending my hard-earned money on it. Goodbye Lincoln!

We decided to check out the Lincoln because I read that you get more for your money than a Cadillac.  I just wish the radio controls were easier.  Also, I wish I could use voice controls on phone, i.e., “Call Bob”, instead of dialing. I hate taking my eyes off the road to find the radio controls.  That is my only complaint!

lincoln,mkc,2017,Tom Barnard, 08/20/2020,My favorite suv I’ve owned.,5,"Look. I’ve owned two CRV’s, a Murano, and a 2016 Mercedes GLC, and the 2017 Lincoln MKC is my favorite SUV I’ve owned. Sure, each of the SUV’s I’ve driven has had its up and down points, if you are looking for ride comfort, quiet, a killer standard sound system, just an extremely comfortable place to spend a car trip in the front seat, the MKC should top your list. 

If you have to put people in the back seat for long trips, look for a bigger option. But I don’t do that. My lifestyle is just me and my wife. And this car is utterly perfect. And a total steal at certified used pricing.

lincoln,mkc,2018,Timothy, 04/18/2018,Finally a Man's Crossover,5,"Most crossovers appear geared toward the soccer mom, atleast in my opinion. The exceptions are typically the BMW X3 or Audi Q5. I test drove those 2, the Rogue, Mazda and Escape (Ford) and the Lincoln MKC was superior to them all. The drive, comfort, seats, technology, ease of getting in/out and styling were all awesome. I have owned my MKC since the beginning of the year and it is truly a car that appeals to men, thus Lincoln's reputation of being a men's auto line. The car is muscular in style and smooth in ride. Several people have commented on how sharp the car is and asked ""what is that car""? It is actually nice owning such a nice luxury car that is not owned by everyone on the street. This is a winner for Lincoln. Love the welcome lights, ambient lighting, comfortable seats and climate control. I would opt for the dramatic panoramic sunroof. It is great and backseat riders love it. The backseat is a little small but the seats do recline for comfort.

lincoln,mkc,2019,Moonman, 09/06/2018,Great vehicle....after a rocky start,5,"Drove everything in the segment. Was prepared to spend more or less, just wanted a solid vehicle and that describes the 2019 MKC. Very planted and low-drama on the road. Excellent visibility. Small cargo area -- it's workable tho. Extremely quiet, and that leads to my interesting first-encounter-with-Lincoln (and American cars in general!) tale: During test drive, salesman and I both noted a leather defect and a rattle coming from the back interior. made the deal with the understanding both would be addressed. leather got fixed right away. the rattle required two trips to dealer -- on the second one, it took nearly 2 weeks and required help from the Lincoln ""concierge"" program. kudos to dealership for staying after it and escalating up to the Ford ""hotline"" for a fix. the noise is gone now, and though it was a hassle, I'm impressed with the way this issue was handled. If Lincoln is going to compete in ""luxury"" segment it needs to offer service that goes above and beyond and that did happen in this case. Lots of people overlook the MKC, not sure why. it's totally solid, a great vehicle in a very competitive segment.

lincoln,mkc,2019,Ol Ned, 08/12/2019,Smooth and quiet,4,"4 months and 6000 miles so far and still pleased with the 2019 MKC select. Like the button shifter, makes old stick shifters seem awkward. The 2.0 turbo engine is quite peppy and quiet. This car shifts, accelerates and responds much better if you don't stomp hard on the gas - plenty of power. I don't like the Navigation much though, not nearly as useful as the Garmin system in my Jeep. Blind spot and cross-traffic alert feature is great. Rear cargo area a little compact for an SUV, but as much space as any car trunk. It works great for us. Back seat roomy enough, we've had no complaints from passengers. "

lincoln,mkc,2019,Francis , 02/19/2020,Mixed Feelings - Some good Some Not,2,"For some reason Ford/Lincoln has many weird quirts that Asian companies have LONG figured out. For example, there is one button for the roof shade open/close. Another for the sunroof forward/back and yet another for the moonroof/vent only feature. All of these are incorporated into one singular switch with Kia and Hyndai without the need to feel around the roof panel for all the unnecessary buttons. With Kia/Hyndai you simply press it once lightly to the first detente, either forward or back, and the shade opens/closes. A harder press past this point opens or closes the sunroof with only ONE rocker style swith. Same goes for the mirror buttons - too many! And two buttons for the dashboard lighting dimmer/illumination switch. WHY two? Why not one that rocks up or down ... ridiculous amounts of buttons. Then there's the overly large console. I'm a small guy at 5' 8"" and 187 lbs but my hips is already at the edge of the small seats. I'd rather have larger/wider seats and less of an intrusive console. Finally the standard radio sucks. Period. So why did I buy it? Because Ford handed it to me for free. 0%/0 money down, no payments 89 days plus 20% off MSRP. It was a free car .... And every vehicle in my family was Hyndai or Kia and I was trying to break from the Korean grip on my household. My next car will be Hyndai - simply put they are much more intelligently engineered, have 100k mile warranties, and more safety technology. This was free. That was the only advantage.

lincoln,mkc,2019,01FLHT09SKY, 06/06/2020,More power,4,"Nice ride, very quiet... I also was looking at the Cadillac XT4.  But Lincoln had the bigger engine.  I went with the 2.3Turbo and AWD....
A little disappointed with the 2.3T. I thought it would have more spunk??? I also test drove a 2020 Corsair 2.0T, which seemed faster than my 2.3??? 
Otherwise a great car. Other than the engine( maybe will get better after break-in)
My only other 2 beefs are ::: THE GAS FILL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE---- REALLY LINCOLN????
You must pull in opposite everybody else except Japanese cars!!!!  POSES A PTOBLEM AT CROWDED PUMPS!!! IRRITATING.... 
Last but not least... (Everybody thinks its great) I MISS A REAL SHIFTER!!! ( reminds me of a 1065 Plymouth Valiant)ALMOST BOUGHT THE XT4 BECAUSE OF THIS, YOUR 2.3T SAVED YOU!!!!! 
Also below on your model choice.... THERE IS NO 2.3TURBO CHOICE!!!!  
But in all honesty, GLAD I WENT WITH THE MKC......

lincoln,mkt,2010,LoveMKT, 07/27/2010,Best car ever,5,"This is my first Lincoln and I LOVE this car! I've owned 6 or 8 Mercedes, several Volvos, Cadillac, Chrysler and about everything in between.  I traded in a 2010 Lexus RX350 with 2475 miles on it. I HATED that car! It's a new redesign and it's a joke.  This Lincoln is turning out to be the best car I've ever owned. I can't say enough good about it.  I special ordered and got the standard engine on purpose after trying out both. It has plenty of power and I've seen 27 mpg on the highway at 70 mph. It will always be around 25 or better."
lincoln,mkt,2010,HemiFan, 10/28/2010,Love this Vehicle,4,"Got everything on it except, parallel parking. Self adjusting cruise control is amazing, so the the navigation system. Front brakes were replaced at 7500 miles, because of scratching sound. They will do it for free. Aside from that this car handles and performs with ease. Three hour trips are a breeze."
lincoln,mkt,2010,CH Stoltz, 03/07/2019,Still ticking,4,"Very solid vehicle.  Comfy family of six ride.  Over 200 thousand miles with no major repairs.  Teenagers are becoming too tall   for the third row seats.  They will be driving soon so no big deal.
"
lincoln,mkt,2010,MrBio, 06/22/2010,Has it All,4,"The unique styling is head-turning.  The ride, performance, and quality are evident from the first drive.  I compared the MKT to Acura MDX, BMW X5, Buick Enclave, and Audi Q7.  This is the only car with:  heated AND cooled front AND 2nd row seats;  Power fold 2nd AND 3rd row seats; easy entry and exit.  The fridge/freezer between the 2nd row captain chairs is great.   Blind spot and cross traffic alert, Voice everything-from climate, radio, weather, to Nav., adaptive cruise control, auto parallel park are all excellent features that work very well. Thanks Lincoln for making a car that does not look like any other car out there.  I want to be noticed as out of the ordinary."
lincoln,mkt,2010,FoMoCoBob, 10/23/2010,Edmunds is Way Off Base!,5,"Have about 6500 miles on the MKT - vehicle is awesome!  Styling definitely stands out-not another blah Lexus look-a-like. Performance kicks u- no-what! Lincoln definitely slammed one out of the park with this one.  Style, comfort, performance, utility, technology, economy - it's all there - the total package!  And guess what I forgot to mention - quality - from an American company - you already know it!  If you buy from someone else, you truly are non-American.  There is nothing the Asian 3 can offer that surpasses this vehicle."
lincoln,mkt,2010,tomg6335, 10/06/2010,Lincoln MKT,5,This is really a great car.  I have over 9000 miles on my MKT and it's surpassed all my expectations.  Who ever said this is a Ford Flex is pretty stupid.  Its like saying a Camry comparable a Lexus ES350.  The interior is first class the ride is smooth and quiet and most of all fun to drive.  The hardware is top shelf and the interior up there with any BMW or Mercedes.  Fuel economy is also very good for a car this size.  I'm averaging about 19 mpg city/highway.
lincoln,mkt,2010,MKTHappyOwner, 12/19/2009,Very Happy With my Choice,5,"We looked at the Q7, XC-90, MDX, Enclave and the MKT.  The closest equal was the Q7 and I'm happy to say the MKT is a much better car. The Eco boost engine is the way to go.  Almost 100 HP more than the Q7 and still better mileage than that car.  Interior space is much better with the MKT.  The Sync system is top notch.  The ability to plug my IPod into the USB and control it via the touch screen is great.  THX sound system is off the charts.  Sync/Nav/Voice Recognition etc. is very well thought out and the level of integration is impressive.  I went into this purchase heavily leaning to the Q7.  After I drove the MKT, it was an easy decision.  Very happy to buy American over the Audi."
lincoln,mkt,2010,SkyKing, 08/24/2010,Could Be Better,4,"The comfort and driving experience of this car is the equal of a Mercedes, Lexus or Infinity. That's saying a lot for a Ford.  It drives like a dream. Power and handling are exceptional. The backup camera is outstanding, although it takes about 10-15 seconds for it to come on after startup - not so good. Sound system is likewise exceptional, but it is complex to operate the Sync feature. I get errors when it connects to my iPhone, then it begins playing from my iPhone without my command, thus draining the iPhone battery. The Nav system is likewise needlessly complex, taking a half-dozen slow steps to do what my 2003 Acura could do with one spoken voice command."
lincoln,mkt,2010,Ozzie, 12/23/2009,Merry MKTmas,4,"I just drove this home from Disney with the family loaded to the gills with suitcases. I traded in a 2008 Mazda CX-9. My family found it comfy and very quiet. This is the most solid feeling American vehicle I have ever purchased. For its size and heft the handling is excellent. Seats are spectacular and firmer than the mushy Flex. My girls are 64-65 inches tall and their heads don't hit the roof in the the 3rd row seats. Those large of torso will not do well in back. I was planning on getting a Flex, but after driving this I thought it was worth the difference. We own a Benz R320 and this feels the same if not better. We got 21 MPG highway which is good for size and load. Love the look."
lincoln,mkt,2010,sally, 01/15/2010,awesome car,5,"I love this car, could not ask for anything better.  Has alot of power, I bought the ecoboost engine and the acceleration is great...  I like to haul alot of antiques, so having the option to fold down the rear seats gives me alot of cargo space."
lincoln,mkt,2010,J & L, 02/10/2010,MKT a Winner,5,"We wanted a AWD, 7 passenger luxury crossover with low front seats with good handling and power  for winter driving. We considered  a MDX, GX450, MBR, BMWX5, Enclave, and Q7. After test driving a MKT we were blown away. The EcoBoost  is very fast with little twin turbo lag and the handling great for a vehicle this large.( we also have a 2004 Porsche 911 Cab ). We ordered out a loaded 7 passenger so we would have a full second seat to hold our 106 pound boxer dog and lots of grand kids. The car interior heats up very fast and the heated front and back seat are super. The MKT is a lot of luxury for the $ and can  compete head on with the Germans and Japanese with it head held high at less $.  "
lincoln,mkt,2010,tjg846, 04/27/2010,Great Car,5,"I have about 5,000 miles on my MKT.  It is no Ford Flex.  The car is smooth plush and very nicely appointed.  Interior is very comfortable and extremely well designed.  The 3rd seat is a bit tight-but who cares its for kids or for smaller adults for short trips.  I did not want a mini van.  Lincoln did a fantastic job on this car and deserves a thumbs up.  All and all I'm very satisfied with this car.  Incidentally, I'm not a Ford person--- this car has made a believer out of me.  Ford can make a great car!!"
lincoln,mkt,2010,Tripper, 05/12/2010,Great Highway Cruiser,4,"I was originally going to buy the MKS, but when I drove an MKT I fell in love with the interior plus the versatility of the crossover design.  Highway driving is actually fun...the adaptive cruise is incredible, sound system and sync are state of the art.  The seats are incredibly comfortable and despite the somewhat limited view sideways and back, the extra large mirrors and blindspot warning system make up for those defeciencies.  Personally I love the exterior design, but understand it is  'love it or hate it' for most people.  I do love having a unique luxury vehicle...not just another Lexus RX!"

It took 3 days and several phone calls to even get a loaner. Dealer does not return our calls about our new MKT. Paid for 2010 Lincoln MKT, driving 2009 mercury. Beware and ask about the new ignition problems. It may be a great car. Hard to tell when you can't drive it! "
lincoln,mkt,2010,jdgmint, 10/24/2009,Finally.,5,"This MKT is head and shoulders above any other ""Crossover"". The quality, comfort and technology is equal, and probably higher, then anything the Germans or Japanese have to offer. Nice going Ford!! We're finally back on top!"
lincoln,mkt,2010,MyGeorgeJ, 12/11/2009,Great New Car,4,"Bought the base MKT with Elite package, rear bucket seats with console and rear entertainment about 1 month ago.  Couldn't be happier.  The car is very comfortable.  The middle row has tons of leg room, and with this crossover lower to the ground than most, my wife's grandparents slipped in and out with ease.  Great to drive.  It's very responsive and has good, not great, acceleration.  Test drove the Ecoboost and would get that next time.  What a great engine!  Have really enjoyed the Ford/Microsoft Synch system.  Easy to use with lots of cool features.  After a month of ownership, I'm still excited to get in and drive it every time."
lincoln,mkt,2010,stormey, 12/27/2009,Lincoln's back in the luxury game,5,"When we decided to replace our MB, Lincoln wasn't in the running until late.  But it made the best impression.  Ride is better than the MB S-class and equal to Lexus LS in our opinion.  This is our first Lincoln. I'm impressed!  It handles very well for a large vehicle.  Give Lincoln a look, you won't regret it!"
lincoln,mkt,2010,misa786, 12/31/2009,Great Car! Best one I have ever driven!,4,This car is great.  I a historical Nissan buyer.  But I chose this time around to look at american luxury based on my horrible experience with the Nissan Murano.  This car has amazed me so far in terms of its features that come standard and its spectacular drive!  It is really the smoothest/most flexible SUV I have driven so far. Looking forward to years of comfort in this car as long as Lincoln stays true to their recent reliability reputation.
lincoln,mkt,2010,tracyd, 01/11/2010,Comfort and Performance,4,"Looked at several other ""cross overs"" but once behind the wheel of the MKT, the decision was easy.  The MKT handles great and the EcoBoost gives it acceleration you might not expect in car of this size/mass.  Sync Navigation system is incredible. Never thought I would want/need a car that would park itself but park assist actually works very well when needed.  Fit and finish is outstanding.  Third row is really only for the smaller folks but it can haul a lot with the seats folded down.  Rear seat entertainment system is great with a lot of options for gaming, etc. for those in the second row.  Can't get a very good read on fuel economy yet as still under 1,000 miles (had 13 at purchase).  "
lincoln,mkt,2010,John, 01/13/2010,Excellent Design and Quality,5,"Just bought the vehicle without knowing much about it and was thoroughly impressed by the quality, comfort and engineering. Outstanding acceleration, great handling and typical Lincoln Town Car style quiet ride. Excellent safety features are part of a unique package assembled by Ford. I have owned 4 Town Cars and currently have 2 Jaquars XJ series. This MKT hadles as good as the XJ8 and is as much fun to drive. Highly recommended,"
lincoln,mkt,2010,RH in Bucks County, 02/10/2010,Great New Car from an American Company,4,"I just received the Lincoln and couldn't be more pleased. First off, I special ordered it and received it one day short of 4 weeks! I test drove the Lexus GX460 and the Acura MDX. This car has a better and quieter ride and significantly more room. It is features loaded and thousands of dollars less expensive than the Lexus. My only concern is the long term relability of the vehicle. So far, I'm ectastic about buying it and HIGHLY recommend it to others."
lincoln,mkt,2010,Docmo, 02/20/2010,My MKT,4,"Overall, I am exceptionally pleased with this vehicle.  Mine is a fully loaded EcoBoost.  Like most, I wish the gas mileage was a bit better.  Still, the vehicle has great power and refinement."

My Ecoboost has amazing driving dynamics. Edmunds review is off base. MKT is worth more than a Flex as it is a lot more luxurious and has different cache.  I also own an Enclave (also great but very different) and turned in an LR3 (not so great) as my previous car and compared Flex, R-Class, XC90, Commander and LR4 for this purchase.  Perplexing and disturbing discovery made after purchase... MKT has a partially disabled SYNC system. Check out the website and flick thru the cars. The list of features is cut in half for MKT. Focus has the full suite and the MKT is handicapped!?!"
lincoln,mkt,2010,MRBIO, 06/14/2010,Worth Every Penny & Beautiful,5,"The styling is unique, which is why I bought it.  I do not want a car like every other car on the road. I compared to Audi Q7, Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Buick Enclave. What other car has heated and cooled front and 2nd row seats, a fridge/freezer between the 2nd row seats, power fold 2nd and 3rd row seats, and safety like this? For the money, it is a great deal.  Oh, and it is worth the extra money over the ford Flex (the box).  The quality of the interior cannot even be compared."
lincoln,mkt,2010,Scott, 09/18/2009,this people mover is rock,4,"the MKT is ridiculously quick, far faster than a luxury 7 -seats crossover should to be. interior is nice touched, the sync is user friendly. like the led taillight in the back. seats are very comfy,"

On the day I went to close the deal on an MKX, I saw an MKT in the lot and thought it looked like a hearse.  But when I looked inside it has the luxurious look I was looking for.  Once I drove it - it was a done deal.  Quiet, comfortable ride, good sounds, nice bells and whistles, and not that much of a departure from my Explorer - but a huge step up to a luxury vehicle that I wanted.   I love this car and call it the Patmobile! Like me - it's big, classy, unique and I don't see it going and coming.  "

The MKT handles great: it has ample pick-up and good braking; it hugs the road with a smooth, quiet ride.  It has lots of features and conveniences that pamper the driver and passengers.  Every time I drive it, I know I'm in a luxury car."

The Flex and the MKt are built on the same chassis and you would never know it. The ride is Great, the style is great, the features in my car are truly outstanding. I factory ordered this car and the wait was well worth it. Adaptive cruise is a must for all cars, Collision Warning - a must, Sway control with the Factory Class 3 hitch is a must. "
lincoln,mkt,2011,npdan, 07/19/2011,Very Nice Crossover,4,"Never thought we would buy an MKT as we had our sights set on a GMC Acadia Denali.
We loved the looks of the Acadia but we decided to test drive a new MKT and that ended our thoughts of the Acadia.
The Lincoln won every comparison in performance, equipment, handling, quietness and quality of interior materials.
Only complaint on the Lincoln MKT is it's worthless 3rd row seat.
Anyone over the height of 5 feet can not sit back there.
It is worthless for anyone except small children.
This is our first new Lincoln and we are extremely happy with this car.
It is a delightful touring car with lots of luxuries.
For us, it has been a perfect fit."
lincoln,mkt,2011,Wayne Galloway, 12/29/2015,Used MKt,5,"I bought the 2011 Lincoln MKT used with 38,000 miles on it in 2015.  I absolutely love the car.  The down side seems to be excess tire wear and visability out the back window.  Other than those two items I love everything about the car.  Drove it home to Pennsylvania from New Jersey in a hell of a snow storm.  Freeway speed was cut to 45 mph due to the driving snow.  Car handled excellent in those conditions.  The third row seating is pretty useless except for small children.  Leg room is adequate but the head room in the third row seat is lacking.  The rest of the car is excellent for entry/exit, leg room, head room and over all comfort.  I am 6' tall at 300 pounds and drive the car in total comfort.  As far as cost for a used vehicle, I paid less for my Lincoln than a comparable Toyota Highlander, Arcadia would have cost.  They were around 2K-3K more money for comparable year and mileage.

I developed a problem at around 70,000 miles.  You would be driving and the engine would just shut off and not restart.  Had to have it towed to the dealer 4 times in 6 months, dealer couldn't find the problem.  No codes!  The last time this happened they thought they had it repaired, loose wire at the fuel pump, but they had replaced the fuel pump the first time.  So why did they not find the loose wire then.

Traded the car for a Lincoln MKZ and love it.

lincoln,mkt,2011,Liz, 11/21/2017,Will it make 100k?!,2,"I bought this from a Ford dealership just a little over 2 years ago. It was the service managers wife's car. I suppose that should have been a sign if I had known what TSBs were then. This thing has gone to a Ford or Lincoln dealership for numerous TSB (Technical Service Bulletins) so all the problems my MKT has had are well documented with Lincoln. The sunroof is working surprisingly, but for nearly 2 years it didn't. The trunk has hurt my head because it doesn't stay elevated when it's supposed to. This thing has seen at dealership shop every month since June. Yes, so once a month I have had to bring this pos in for one thing or another and since June it rattles just awful. June, July, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov!! Two of those times it went back because their mechanics did something wrong. Both times I had to fight for them to do the right thing. The first time to get them to fess up to their mistake and the 2nd one to get me a rental because they messed up and were out of rentals. I have little faith in this brand and the dealerships that sell them. About a week after one turbo was replaced the other one went out and we got stranded during hurricane Irma. Now I am on my 3rd turbo. When the turbos work it has awesome pick up and go. All and all I would not let this pretty design fool me twice. Yes, it's very comfortable but it's also very unreliable. As a single mom, I will take an uncomfortable ride over one that's going to leave us stranded.

It is fun to drive and handles beautifully.
Exterior styling is lacking and almost stopped me from buying the vehicle.
Interior knobs, and panels are cheap plastic, and not typical of a $60K car.
Overall performance is good, mileage on road - 23 mpg!
Around town about 19.
Only consistent problem I have had is intermittent failure of heat to work.
They are replacing the actuator this week.
I hope that finally fixes it!

I would purchase another if the model had not been discontinued.  It is comfortable, quiet, drives well, and looks good!  And it is roomy for when the grandkids travel with us.  Negatives are cheap plastic on door interiors, and dash, and a recurrent problem with the heater failing which Ford at first did not want to fix as it was only happening occasionally!

lincoln,mkt,2012,Mr. Waters, M.,MKT Sense - American Drive,5,"I have no regrets with this vehicle for this is a Lincoln and which possesses the heritage of the brand, but creativity of the 21 Century thinking.  I love the leather cabin and out of box styling, it like a plane flight on the ground.  This MKT Lincoln has steering shifters with this semi-manual/full automatic feature, it's wonderful... when you need the burst of performance when passing in traffic.  So far as it styling , The 1939's attributes are pure American, not Japanese or Chinese as many lost souls love to follow; MKT styling is attributed to pure USA motoring of 1930 's. Note the prominent split ventilating front grill design and wagon/caboose liftgate - pure American.   Everywhere I go, work, church or play this crossover turns heads, the complement has not stop.  I am LMC fan and my next vehicle will the SVC by Lincoln.  I am supporter of the Ford Motor Company,I know this is a bad word among those that swear their life upon anything other than American cars, trucks or SUV's, but If you don't stand for American, you'll stand for anything.

lincoln,mkt,2012,zaabby, 06/06/2012,Do not buy,2,"I am very disappointed with this car. It is my fault I bought it however.
It is very uncomfortable on long trips as it is too narrow.
The two zone comfort system is a fake; as there is only one fan.
Thus the zone with the greatest different controls the fan.
The safety system is silly; it beeps and you get a message on the screen telling to look around.
 Plus it has lots of other poor design choices.

lincoln,mkt,2013,Classy, coolco,COOL MAMA IN A COOL CLASSY CAR,5,"My car is cool, classy and it stands out amongst the other boring looking SUVs.  I leased my 2013 MKT and my lease is up soon.  I'm thinking about buying another one.  I've been researching and test driving other SUVs and none of them compare.  I tested the enclave, MDX, qx60 and none of them have the excitement behind the wheel as the MKT.  I tend to drive pretty swiftly and I love the powerful ecoboost engine.  If I need to pass another driver I can do it with great confidence.  I also love that I have the benefits of a minivan without actually having to drive a minivan.... I'm too cool for that!  My husband loves my car too and agrees that buying one when my lease is up is best.  LINCOLN PLEASE DONT STOP MAKING THE MKT!!!!! Lincoln hmade a classyclassy SUV that out performs any other SUV on the road in this price range!

lincoln,mkt,2013,teerex, 09/23/2014,Emperor of the Highway.,5,"We've had our MKT for over a year now, and it keeps exceeding our expectations. Room, comfort, power and even amazing agility for such a big rig. Begs to be taken on long road trips. It can be so comfortable that you forget how long you've been driving (so it warns you that it's time for a break!). 

The electronic helpers are very effective. The adaptive cruise is amazing and makes me wish all our cars had it. The lane departure system is equally predictable and useful. 

The styling is often characterized as ""polarizing"", and I don't really see what's so controversial about it. I think it's very long, low, elegant and even a touch menacing. The low center of gravity helps handling."
lincoln,mkt,2013,Robinson F. Asitimbay, 04/27/2016,Really great crossover if you have the bucks,4,"The car itself is a great machine. Very fast acceleration and its comfortable. Its pretty good in gas, and pretty fast. Rides 7 of us and has done a lot of traveling. Although the car is great and looks amazing in and out, the maintaince is horrible. The pieces are off this land, and everything is soooo expensive. I think a highlander would've been cheaper and maybe just as nice.
"
lincoln,mkt,2013,Bentley, 09/24/2018,Lots of repairs that shouldn't have been,3,"This car had only 66,000 when I sold it and numerous repairs under the extended warranty which shouldn't have happened.  It required a new steering gear, 3 control arm replacements, rear seal replacement, adaptive cruise control replacement and numerous rattles.  It rides very hard on rougher roads which there are plenty of in Michigan.  The driver armrest stitching came apart and they wouldn't replace it.  The front seats are not comfortable as there is a platform directly under your feet that does not allow you to place your feet flat on the floor.  The performance is good on acceleration and it is a smooth ride on good roads and quiet, but any kind of rough road, it just throws you around.  Residual value is not good, so it is expensive to own.  Lots of room for storage.

lincoln,mkt,2013,james303, 01/16/2015,2013 LINCOLN MKT LEAKING ANTIFREEZE AT 59000 MILES,4,"I purchase a 2013 Lincoln MKT,  and it's a big mistake i made.  the biggest problem I had with this car is the (water pump). 

 at 59000 miles the water pump is leaking antifreeze and  after takeing it to the FORD dealer they told me it's the water pump. that need to be replace.

and it's cover under the warranty but it will take them a week to get the job don.  and will code me one hundred dollars.  

plus I am having problem with the wipers. when I turn it off it still work I have to play with the switch before the wiper blade stop working.

few months ago the seal for the transmission was leaking oil.  the seal was replace free of charge under the warranty but cost me time."
lincoln,mkt,2013,Michael in PCB, 12/17/2018,I LOVE THIS CAR,5,"I bought my MKT  and have kept it longer than any other car I've owned except a sports car I used to have.   It is a pleasure to drive and I have only had one time in 5 years that it failed to start and it just needed a new battery cable.    I get 20 mpg and I listen to great music on the sound system.   The leather has held up fantastically well.   I live on the Gulf of Mexico and the paint still looks new.

lincoln,mkt,2014,jeffking1, 10/03/2013,Enjoying our 2014 MKT EcoBoost,4,"We replaced our aging MB R320 with the MKT. We checked competing vehicles but the Lincoln was the best value. The ride is good except on harsh roads, due to the optional 20"" wheels. We are having no problems with Lincoln Sync and find it easy to use. The car is extremely quiet even compared to the MB. Handling is sharp, unlike the numb MB. The dual turbo do their job nicely. Gas mileage is as advertised so far. More foot room should be provided for the driver, the only real flaw so far. The safety features like blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control work great. Lane drift warning is annoying and I shut it off. I would not hesitate to recommend this car."
lincoln,mkt,2014,william creekmore II, 03/30/2016,Great Car,5,"Never own  a car that I enjoyed more. I have owned Cadillac's for over the last 30 years. I use to trade every two years. I have complaints of Cadillac's , but this Lincoln rides the best of any car I have every owned.
"
lincoln,mkt,2014,S Baruah, 09/05/2018,An unappreciated value,4,"While the platform is aging, the MKT is a unsung value in the luxury crossover space.  Some car reviewers dislike the exterior styling, but I love it.  Unlike most SUV/CUV designs today, the MKT is long, sleek with a bit lower height profile than most.  Makes it more like a big station wagon than a truck like SUV.  After four years, the MKT has been exceptionally reliable and the Lincoln dealer is awesome - great support, service and design.  Power and interior pace is plentiful and has some really great features (e.g. rear bucket seat with heating and cooling, rear fridge, automated parking assist, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and more).  Oddly, however, it lacks front parking sensors(?!).  Other cons are that as with the older platform, the ride quality is not best-in-class.
"
lincoln,mkt,2014,skbmichigan, 06/24/2015,Surprisingly Good - A Functional Fashion Statement,4,"Was initially looking at Land Rover RR Sport.  But while that was a better car (amazing handling and style) the MKT was an elegant and less expensive alternative.  Packed with technology (adaptive cruise, cooled seats front/rear) and I really like the style - it's elegant and stands out (not sure why critics don't like styling).  Some elements reveal that the platform is based on a family car (e.g. old fashioned foot operated parking brake, no front parking sensors even on top level model).  Great power with 365 hp V6 and interior style with two rows of bucket seat is great.  "
lincoln,mkt,2014,Richard , 09/14/2020,Left alone with known issues acting up,3,"Comfortable , roomy, quiet and powerful enough when needed with the Ecoboost. I left a Ford Flex for it, so the styling is not an issue for me. Actually, I like both. Save for what follows, I like the car. 

What concerns and disapoints me are known issues shared by many owners on internet forums that leads me to conclude that they are flawed design. 1- the light cluster that covers the width of the tailgate is known to take water and mess with the electrical of your lights and back-up camera. You have to change the whole cluster. 2100$CDN ! It does not include the camera (500$) 2-the climate control will on its own act up and go to high. You have to change the whole electronic panel behind the controls (600$). These prices do not include labour.

Lincoln does not recognizes any of these problems  past the warranty and offers no good-will program or help. I have experienced all three problems between 80 to 85,000 miles in the last few months. For the record, I was able to source only one used light cluster. Once there....it had taken water also !

Bottom line: for a so-called luxury brand, Lincoln is not offering much support to its customers on well documented repeated MKT failures. Fortunately, I have not experienced so far another known flaw that I noticed when researching mine : « explosion » of the moonroof. 

I was looking at the Aviator for next year before all that. Not anymore. They lost me.

lincoln,mkt,2016,b24chicago, 12/08/2020,"Quirky, Feature Rich, Powerful Family Hauler",5,"THIIISSSS is a 2016 Lincoln MKT. I've had this vehicle for about 6 months now and feel I can offer a fairly comprehensive review. My model is a 7 passenger EcoBoost with the Elite and Technology packages and 20 inch wheels. First, those wheels - they look great but give you less rubber between you and the road, somewhat defeating the purpose of the 3 suspension modes. It isn't a rough riding vehicle by any means, but the 19 wheels (which are kind of ugly) likely give a better ride. The MKT is very comfortable, the seats are well padded and covered in very nice leather. The power adjustable seats, pedals, and steering wheel guarantee virtually everyone will sit comfortably. I updated the Sync 3 system to the newest version to allow Apple CarPlay functionality which is a must, in my opinion. The Sync system is ok, but feels somewhat outdated. The controls - there are no physical buttons for the heated/cooled seats or heated steering wheel. This isn't a huge deal, but is a minor irritation to always have to cycle through 3 or 4 screens to get to seat/wheel controls. The tri-zone climate control (with rear seat controls) is a nice feature for the family. One minor complaint about the heated steering wheel is that it doesn't heat the top wood grain covered portion. Not a big deal, but heated all over would be better. The adaptive cruise control system works well, however it doesn't work below 12 mph, so keep that in mind. The power up/down third row is phenomenal and gives access to solid cargo room with the seats down. The second row of seating offers very generous leg and head room. Third row access is fairly easy with the one touch button that tumbles the second row seats forward. However, once in the third row you'll find that due to the sloping roof line you won't be able to sit with your hid upright unless you're under about 5' 3"", a massive point against the MKT. One of the biggest plusses in favor of the MKT is the power. the twin turbo V6 provides more power than virtually any other vehicle in its class and easily moves the hefty MKT quickly whenever called upon. Handling is good for a vehicle of its size, however maneuverability in tight spots is fairly poor due to the length of this vehicle. Speaking of, if you have a smaller garage, the MKT may not fit. I'm not kidding, it fits in my garage (barely), but doesn't fit in the garages of several friends and family, so take some measurements first. Overall, the 2016 MKT is a great vehicle for the family, although the third row is not as practical as one would hope. You get good technology, comfort, quietness, and power in a polarizing, but in my opinion, beautiful package. And, for better or worse, it doesn't look like every other three row SUV. If you want to stand out a little, have understated power, a comfortable, quiet ride with decent modern tech the MKT is a great option.

lincoln,mkt,2019,Ace Detective Retired, 10/04/2020,Like a Custom made Supercar,5,"As a Senior citizen car lover who has had nearly 100 cars thru the years I would place this near the top of the pile.  Always looked for a sporty high powered car and love my 19 MKT Reserve with the full options package.  Bought it used in March and haven't seen another one on the road so it's like having a Custom made car.  Once had a 1967 Chevy Biscayne with a 427 4 Speed , we called them sleepers back then and this tops it with a 6 cylinder Twin turbo, and with every safety and comfort option you can name.  With the 427 I couldn't even get A/C !!  It is not only AWD and super fast but it has the option to switch from normal to comfort to sport modes that changes handling, engine and transmission settings with a switch !  It won't win any mileage derby but it goes from grandpa's three row grocery better to a track car in a minute.  If you love toys, this is the car !!

I was ran off the road at an intersection by someone that blew a red light, forcing me to jump a curb.  Surprisingly, no damage other than an alignment and wheel balancing.  The power is very adequate (this coming from someone that had a hopped up (525hp) car.  I get 25-28mpg, depending on the highway speed, typically 75mph.  Pretty good mpg for an awd.

lincoln,mkz,2007,stuart adams, 11/12/2006,puts the Japanese in the dirt.,4,"This is a beautiful car. It has a great ride, classy styling and will get up and go. The navigation and stereo system are easy to use. It is the most comfortable car, I have driven. I looked at Japanese and German cars, and this was by far the best value. This car is worth a look, and to all you German, Japanese yuppies this is a high performance luxury car at 2/3 the price. I think it has a better ride and is better engineered than most cars in its class. Ford/Lincoln did well on this one. I traded in my 2005 Subaru Legacy and was very impressed by ride, luxury, performance of this vehicle."
lincoln,mkz,2007,L.M., 04/08/2010,Happy owner,5,"I purchased my MKZ in April 2007, and currently have 34,000 miles on it. I get about 22 mpg average and at least 27 mpg on the road. I have gotten as high as 30 mpg on flat terrain with no headwind. The car has an elegant interior, and I have had no mechanical problems of any Kind. The on/off switch on the radio broke. That was under warranty, and they replaced the entire radio, claiming you cannot order just the plastic switch cap. The handling is excellent, acceleration is excellent. I drive, on the highway, about 70 to 74 mph (speed limit 70) The car has plenty of acceleration at that speed, allowing a fast and safe pass of slower cars on two lane roads."
lincoln,mkz,2007,malcep, 01/16/2007,I Love This Car!!!,5,"I just traded in a 2004 Acura TL and can't begin to tell you how much more I enjoy driving my new MKZ. The MKZ is built much better than the TL. I suffered through rattles and a buzzy stereo speaker with the Acura. The MKZ is solid as a rock. In fact, I would compare it favorably to the 2001 Saab 95 I used to own which was vault like. Don't listen to all of the magazine reviews. This car is outstanding! The ride is comfortable but still has a  European feel. There is no torque steer, which is something I disliked about my TL. The car is appointed beautifully. You owe it to yourself to at least test drive the MKZ. It's a lot a car for the money."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Dave T, 10/27/2006,Serious Contender,5,"Most any magazine review of this car gives it a bland or no endorsement. Ignore them all! Besides that cool, unique interior, this car has great specs - 6 speed trans, 263 horses - better than most BMW's which will cost you thousands more. Riding in the class of a Lincoln for under $30K?? I don't see much to criticize about it whatsoever. It has great acceleration, especially in the middle gears and a tight feel in general.  It's roomy, agile and stylish - I highly recommend it. Also, the dealer experience was very pleasant. One salesperson from start to finish and no pressure at any time. So far so good. Did I mention that the price was only $28K??"
lincoln,mkz,2007,Disappointed, 09/07/2010,The Good and Bad of It,4,I have owned car for 4 years.  I purchased it brand new at top dollar. It has the Lincoln ride. Yea! I have had a few problems with it that the dealership has not been able to fix.  I have had to replace the battery already. The plastic seat support broke and had to be replaced but still catches when I get out. The left front automatic window is scraping and the dealership only lubricates it.  It  makes a noise and leaves marks when  raised and lowered. Big problem since new:  delayed AC activation...Lincoln said this is the way it was made.  The AC does not activate for 30-45 seconds.  I understand it should activate in 8-10 seconds.  Lincoln hasn't been able to determine how to fix this!
lincoln,mkz,2007,Discodug, 01/17/2007,I repectfully disagree on smoothness....,4,"Unless the 05 Towncar makes some improvement over the 04, I must disagree with the comment about smoothness coming up short of the Town Car. At slow street speeds, I do feel the Towncar is SLIGHTLY quieter though.  I did have an initial hi freq ""buzz"" at highway speeds, put a pit in my stomach as I drive 98 miles each way to work and I cant STAND noise. Isolated the problem to the triangular plastic between the RV mirrors and the door frame.  Took it back, dealer sealed it, no more buzz.  I looked at numerous Z's on the lot and many had same symptom...EASILY fixed, so if it happens to you, get it fixed.  This was the only thing that kept me from giving a 10 to exterior & build. I love this car!"
lincoln,mkz,2007,azucks, 08/14/2011,Nothing Stops My MKZ,4,"I have over 25000 miles on this car and have yet to have a problem.
This car is the most reliable and unstoppable car that i have ever owned.
I live in NJ and have little country cottages up in upstate NY and going up those hills in a foot of snow and driving through the mud, sand, dirt, and grass has never posed a problem for my MKZ AWD.
The AWD system is so advanced sometimes i think it does better than my LR4.
The car is amazing in the bad weather and the engine is quite powerful.
It is not a rocketship but it's no slow poke either.
Very few people will use the AWD system like i do for example i went up dirt/mud covered roads yesterday but it is still a nice accessory to have."
lincoln,mkz,2007,MKZluver, 12/18/2006,Fast and Luxurious,5,Love the looks i receive and the compliments about it. most people say they didn't know it was even a lincoln! plenty of room. sound system is incredible and like i've never heard in a car. i always find excuses to go places with it. drives very comfortably when cruising but when pushed hard she moves very quick and sometimes scary! The new 3.5 liter is a huge improvement over the 3.0L. I like the new front fascia over last years zephyr. Lincoln didn't take any short cuts with any cheap materials here. everything is top quality and soft to the touch. don't base your decision by pictures or reviews go out there and test drive one yourself and you will be amazed. Choose over comp. like Lexus Es350
lincoln,mkz,2007,TmamaJ, 02/07/2016,Never again,2,"If you have the 3.5 and the car overheats might as well go to a dealer the water pump is located inside the motor very costly repair.

This is our only criticism so far, but it's a big one!  Wake up Lincoln, your competition is listening!"
lincoln,mkz,2007,Bart, 12/02/2006,Love it Love it Love it,4,"I have had the car for almost two months and have driven 3500 miles.  Great car, I truly enjoy driving it.  Classy yet not too flashy, which is just my style."

lincoln,mkz,2007,Elrod, 12/26/2007,America can compete,4,"I purchased the AWD model in August of this year. I have driven the car for around 5500 miles so far and I have to say that I am extremely pleased. I drove the car in some harsh weather as well and this car is solid. The car takes the bad roads with no problem and asks for more. You really feel safe while driving in the elements. Lincoln did a great job with this car!!  I havent had any problems with the car so far and I have wanted to post this message to help others in deciding whether to buy this car or noit like I did.  As far as fuel economy, could be better. Unless your driving everyday on the highway, you will get an average of around ~20 MPG. "
lincoln,mkz,2007,Shirin, 12/17/2006,Great Car,5,"I just purchased this car and have about 5,000 mile on it. it drives smoothly and design is very beautiful. I love my car. Great car, reasonable price."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Guy, 01/18/2018,Mkz my favorite ride,5,"Made well. Minimum repair cost required. An 06 Zephyr, which in 2007 was renamed MKZ, had 180000 miles and was in the shop for the first time. I expect the same from this car. JD Power ranked it best in category.

lincoln,mkz,2007,pebe98, 09/27/2011,Not Happy,3,"We bought the 07 MKZ used in 08 with 5,200 miles.
It gets parked for the winter and at this time has 20,200 miles on it.
Between the air conditioning and the transmission problems, this car spends more time at the dealership getting fixed and I am paying insurance on a lincoln and am driving a focus loaner.
The dealer just had this car for 2 wks fixing transmission, had it back 2 days and is currently at the dealer again with no end date for repairs to be finished.
It has officially spent more time in the shop than my 10 year old honda odyssey ever has...Would definitely not trust this car on an extended trip any time soon."
lincoln,mkz,2007,MKZer, 05/02/2009,Lincoln can do better than this....,3,"Very ""herky-jerky"" starts caused by the transmission or electronic controls.  Dealership says its inherent in the new design and and even though they acknowledge the rough ride; they say Ford has not given any warranty repair advise.  Therefore, they cant authorize any warranty repairs.  They say it's a problem but don't know what to do.... ""poor design"" i guess.  I'm very disappointed and will be looking to trade out of this car soon."
lincoln,mkz,2007,HELEN, 11/11/2006,Fantastic MKZ,5,"This car is A head turner!, whether driving or parked it attracts attention. Its sleek fun to Drive drop dead gorgeous. Lincoln has outdone themselves. I have own Lincolns since 1993."
lincoln,mkz,2007,vinnieJ, 11/21/2006,Great drive,4,"I recently totaled my Mercury Montego and found this.  Little smaller than what I was getting used to but great to drive.  Smooth, quiet, great acceleration.  Great look"
lincoln,mkz,2007,Kevin F, 01/06/2007,Great Value for an Outstanding Vehicle,5,"The performance, stability and noise control are outstanding for this price range.  I compared this to similar vehicles with the same options and the Lincoln was clearly the winner.  The bonus is that this is a very nice looking vehicle both in and out and it's fun to drive."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Cheryl, 01/26/2007,Lovin' my car,5,"I was set to purchase a BMW but test drove the MKZ out of respect for  my preferred dealer for many years. I drove it and I was hooked, besides everyone has a BMW and I felt I had something better and unique. I love the ride, the look and the comfort.  Everywhere I go, I get a positive reaction. The pick-up and AWD are awesome. And knowing my dealer has a great service department (just in case) made this purchase an easy one."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Fly Boy, 02/05/2007,2007 MKZ,5,Excellent vehicle.  It's truly enjoyable to drive.  I made my first highway trip and felt refreshed after a full day.  I found the dual heater zones to be more effective than in other cars I've owned.
lincoln,mkz,2007,Very Disappointed, 01/26/2017,Very disappointed,2,"I purchased a 2007 Lincoln with approx. 70,000 mile son it.  less than 3 years later I had to replace the PCM panel, 4 tires and then the transmission went out.  I am so upside down till it should be illegal to sell.    I thought Lincoln had better cars for the name and was proud to purchase one.  I wish I never saw the car.  Now I have two car notes and paying for one I can not drive because the cost of the repairs are more than the value of the car.   Broke.

lincoln,mkz,2007,I DO IT MYSELF, 08/14/2008,Happy with my MKZ,5,I always buy used cars so this was a nice find 07 Lincoln MKZ. The ride is quiet. The engine is so quiet that after starting I have to look at tach to see if it's running. The first full tank of gas I avg 33 mph with about 60% of driving over 50 mph and got 26 mpg. This is great when you only avg 33 mph. It shows you stopping eats gas. The luxury you get with this car is great for this price whether new or used.
lincoln,mkz,2007,Fordman, 01/12/2009,My Fabulous MKZ,5,"Over the years (I'm 60ish) I have bought Fords, Chryslers, and Gm vehicules, now my first Lincoln. This car is by far my best car ever. It currently has 22,000 miles and each one of them a total pleasure. It drives like a dream, very comfortable and fuel economy is great.  A frequent 1200 mile trip, which includes 200 mile of hilly country roads, I usually average 25.5+ miles per gallon.  My only complaint is with the exterior design, the rear lights which are too large."

lincoln,mkz,2007,B. Touro, 05/27/2009,2007 Lincoln MKZ,5,"We leased our Lincoln MKZ as a replacement vehicle to an 2004 Honda Accord LX. The Lincoln has options galore, the fit and look of the car is appealing and the ride and performance, coupled with good gas mileage makes this a wonderful car to own. We are considering buying the car at lease end, since we are so satisfied with it.  We also lease a 2008 Cadillac CTS, which is vastly improved over the 2004 CTS it replaced. Compared to the Cadillac CTS, the Lincoln is different in many ways but also just as comfortable and luxurious. We think we have the best of both worlds in our MKZ and CTS autos. As for American made, we have no complaints with either car."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Don Hutto, 01/26/2008,Good buy,4,"Excellent transporation for the bucks. Love the seated/cooled seats, THX surround sound stereo, nav system, common sense approach to controls and buying regular gas. Didn't need to read the plethora of manuals to operate either the stereo or nav system. Very intuitive. Engine response is good. Wish I could manually select gears. Transmission shifting software needs improvement. Very comfortable ride at the sacrifice of handling. I'd buy it again."

I put the 2 cars side by side, they look the same. The standard equipment alone, makes the BMW look striped. The biggie its $20,000 CHEAPER. This is Fords golden ticket. Honestly, I would have paid $10,000 more and felt like I got a deal. I am floored by the cars style and performance. "
lincoln,mkz,2007,JED, 03/05/2007,WOW,5,"After test driving every other car in this class, I drove and bought the best. Very impressive car with no changes needed for my liking, almost made a costly mistake and bought something more expensive with less toys and no growl."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Very Impressed, 04/20/2007,What an Amazing Car!,5,"I am so happy that I got the MKZ. I never thought that I would have ended up buying a Ford car, but I must say the MKZ has really changed my mind about Fords cars. It looks way better than the Lexus inside and out, has plenty of power and a nice sounding growl from the V6 and to top it off, it even runs on regular gas! AWD is a must if you live in a snowy region. The transmission is always in the right gear and it is extremely smooth. This is a fun to drive car for me, and at the same time has plenty of luxury and comfort features such as standard heated seats. The quality of the MKZ is up to or better than the Japanese offerings. For the price of this car, it simply cannot be beat."
lincoln,mkz,2007,JoEy MiGs, 05/23/2007,Classy Brooklyn Style,4,"This is a great car. I saw it online and fell in love with it. I called the dealership, I told them the deal I wanted and they acomodated me. The next day I went in a bought the car. The body style and the ride is wonderful and the interior is amazing. Affordable, and a lot of options that you would normally pay extra for come standard. Lincoln did a great job on the car, I am 23 years old and all my boys are raving about it. It has a young look to it and I think the MKZ and The Navigator are going to be the two hottest cars that Lincoln puts out!"
lincoln,mkz,2007,austin1814, 09/10/2007,"Great car, a well-kept secret",4,"I purchased my 2007 AWD MKZ a month ago. I traded an Acura RSX. I tested an Acura TL, a BMW 328xi, and an Infiniti G35x.  Each vehicle was good, but none of the competitors moved me:  the TL felt like an Accord; the 3-series drives great but it's so common now; the Infiniti was nice, but it too is becoming common.  After the 1st test drive of the Lincoln, I was sold.  The exterior is subtle and classy. The interior is easily the best in its class. The car is more luxury than sport, but it's not boring.  The stereo is great. Every day I have random people stop me to compliment me on the car.  I am very pleased with this car.  It is the nicest car I've ever purchased."

I honestly cannot think of one thing I dislike about this vehicle.  It is priced right, I get good value, the quality is there and it is freakin awesome to drive.  The only shread of issue is in the blind spots in the side mirrors and I cannot honestly tell you whether it is me or in the design.  Otherwise, especially if you get an A plan, this car is the best value around."

The squeaking is back in the front end and will require a great bit more work.  My Mechanic said this is the third MKZ he has seen with the issues of the front end.  I love everything else about the vehicle.  Hate to trade it!!

lincoln,mkz,2007,TJ, 03/06/2007,Big Mistake,2,"I bought this to replace my Audi A6 2.7T.  Trying to be patriotic with my first purchase of an American car in quite a long time. The difference is shocking!  No comparison. My wife's minivan has a smaller turning radius than this car.  The transmission is primitive and pops into gear upon a medium to hard acceleration.  The car feels light with no road grip. The sound system (I got the premium THX II) is just plain awful.  The xenon headlights are only fair. This car's gas mileage is only moderately better than a full- size American SUV. The only redeeming quality about the car is the exterior appearance.  Once you peel that away, it is clear why the American auto industry is ready to fold."

I been driving this car since mid January and I get compliments weekly. The interior is excellent and has a luxury feel. Love the MP3 plug in for my ipod. Very roomy car and the dual seat settings are a plus as my husband has been taking my car everywhere and it is so much easier now that all I have to do is push a button and my seat is back where I want it. The car is absolutely beautiful exterior. When I am parked in a parking lot nothing compares to the beauty. The ride is smooth on the highway and very controllable on the back roads. I travel both to work. Both feels great. Love It!

Very troubling.

I love the characteristic Lincoln ride and quietness. No problems yet (12,000 mile mark). Gets 27 mpg at 75mph as well. Cruises like a dream. Good cold A/C for hot Texas summers! For the money it is an excellent value. I was also able to use an employee discount feature to lower the price as well. I bought this car after driving a used Zephyr that I bought for my Mom."

We are now over 27,000 miles and the car has performed wonderfully.  No this is not a European/Japanese luxury car. But it delivers good gas mileage, 23/29, great comfort and it looks sharp. It has also proven to be very reliable.  As a late model used car, the MKZ can be a super value!"
lincoln,mkz,2007,DAN KANE, 10/17/2006,Nicest car i've ever owned,5,"Spectacular handling, very comfortable, fun to drive, a ton of horsepower, very well redesigned from the 06 zephyr. Nicer riding than the 5 series and the avalon. I am coming out of a maxima, and it does not compare to the ride and quality of a ride than the mkz.

Blows the BMW 530 and 535 out of the water! And at a fraction of the price. And no, i didn't buy this car because i couldn't afford the BMW. I could have bought the M5 if i wanted to, but, I bought the MKZ because i legitimately feel that it's a much better ride, much more comfortable.

Fuel economy is still down from what I would expect, but this car blows away the competition for the price.  I love the light tan interior and light colored wood.  I was surprised that the moon roof, when closed, doesn't add interior noise as I feared it would.  I have the THX-II radio in this car and although it sounds very good, I am disappointed in the bass level, especially with two 6 X 9"" ""sub- woofers"" with that spacious trunk as an enclosure.  The bass is just not there as it is on the regular standard radio!  Rock and roll requires some thumping bass!"

I love everything about this car.  It is fun to drive and the gas mileage is wonderful.  I am getting 29 MPG on the highway.  The only drawback is the NAVTEC map disk are updated every 2 years.  I purchased my car in November 2006 and received the 05 map, the new 07 map was released in December of 06.  If I want an updated map Lincoln is saying I have to pay for an updated version which is in excess of $150.00.  I don't like the fact that a $2495.00 option is already costing me $$$."

It is so classy looking and so much fun to drive. I looked at other cars but this one met most all of my needs and wants. And did it within my budget. It is very responsive for a 6 cyl. But gas mileage is not quite as good as my 8 cyl Continental. Averaging 21 mpg city and road. Could be it is not broken in yet, only had it for 1 month. So far I love it. My 29 y/o son even approved of my choice. "

I am riding in style at a great price. I think Lincoln should advertise this car more. Most people are not aware that it exists! The style is classic and the comfort and quietness of the ride is wonderful.

lincoln,mkz,2007,Jerry R, 07/01/2007,Compare one,4,"I'm really impressed with the MKZ's styling and overall design. The ride is smooth but stable though acceleration isn't as strong as the Acura or Lexus I test drove.The interior is clean and well laid-out with everything within easy reach and easy to see. The THX certified stereo has nice sound. Hours of MP3s can be loaded into the 6 disk player. I have to say, for the price, I feel you can't beat the options (standard or optional) that are available. There's lot of American cars that really do compare in quality to the Japanese. They'll have a tough row to hoe to convince everyone to pass up the Acura or Lexus lines but I think they're well on thier way. "
lincoln,mkz,2007,PatinNJ, 07/16/2007,Love it so far,4,"This car is great so far. Drives smoothly. The nav system is useful as well as cool. The interior is just a little too plasticky.  Having the Sirius radio built in is a real improvement over the add on set-up in my old car. Power is good but it's not as peppy as my Grand Prix GTP which has 20 less horsepower. I did read every review on here before buying it, so thank you to everyone that took the time to post."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Walt, 10/02/2007,Outstanding,5,"Best vehicle I have owned in 10 years. The navigation system is very user friendly. Seats are comfortable, sound system outstanding and we love the fact that we can plug in any MP3 player through a connection in the center console. Driving on long trips is pleasurable and a joy.  The vehicle handles well and the ergonomic layout of the interior makes changing stations or adjusting the temperature level easy.  Plus these is dual climate controls. The memory seating feature is much welcomed as my wife and I are different sizes.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone. "
lincoln,mkz,2007,Bill, 10/03/2007,Fully satisfied,5,"We bought this car about 1 year ago. It has more than fulfilled our expectations (and we have experienced about every other car in and around its class). Not a single problem so far. Very smooth, comfortable, quiet, and secure ride. Solidly built. No irritating vibrations, rattles, wind noises, or transmission quirks. Wonderful suspension engineered to minimize the feel of the road a.k.a. riding on a farm wagon, that several other cars in its class are lauded for (quasi-professional reviewers apparently have a unique sense of whats appealing to many drivers who might consider buying a near luxury car). Excellent acceleration and power for other than the Datona 500.  Highway ~ 27.5 mpg."
lincoln,mkz,2007,dave1968, 10/10/2007,"I tried a bunch, MKZ fit me",4,"I wanted a mid-sized sedan, and ended up looking at 35 vehicles and driving 22 times in a 5 month period. MKZ was the best fit for me, and after 1500 miles I can't find flaws. Mileage is averaging 21, and got 27.3 on a highway-only trip at mostly 70mph. I didn't opt for the NAV system or THX sound, a small Garmin GPS unit fits fine in the console cupholder. Step-in height is more comfortable than a TL, and usable space much better than an IS. Console and instruments aren't trying to be the space shuttle, just useful and tasteful and readable. We're looking forward to feeling the AWD in snow, and a circle-lake-superior trip. All cars involve compromise, MKZ is one to look at."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Ocean, 05/28/2007,An Overall Disappointment,3,"This car has been a major disappointment as we came from a 2003 Lincoln LS V8 that was averaging the same fuel economy :18 MPG.  While the MKZ is AWD, it has less power and a smaller V6 engine.  The build quality and the materials is way below sup bar.  The hard plastics and the gaps in between the interior and exterior panels is ridiculous. The wood trim looks fake, the dashboard has this twin look going on, that seems as if you could move the steering wheel and gauges over to the other side.  Speaking of gauges, the retro looking dash is not cool, its very cheap looking!  Note to Lincoln: Hire some better designers and stop looking to the past.  This will be a long 3yr lease."
lincoln,mkz,2007,z28, 05/24/2007,MKZ,3,"All wheel drive was not on our ""must have"" list, but we are pleased so far and look forward to some winter weather to really test this feature. Interior is as advertised. I like the retro feel of it. The seats are a little lower and therefore a little harder to get out of when compared to our Park Avenue. Would be nice to have some way to close the trunk other than grabing the sheet metal and hoping your hand has a good grip. The trunk opens wide and the lid itself points straight up. Akward I feel. The power is nice and the gauges easy to read. Quiet riding after a short break-in period in whick I felt the suspension was going to be too stiff."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Nick, 05/25/2007,Almost Perfect...,4,"I did a lot of research before leasing an MKZ. In terms of style, features, and AWD, it is a great deal. This is the first American car I've owned, and so far I'm very satisfied.  Obviously Lincoln still has a stodgy image to overcome, but it's on well on its way with the MKZ."
lincoln,mkz,2007,thiscarsamazing!!!!!, 06/01/2007,Best car I ever owned,5,This car is amazing. Even in FWD model it seems to grip the road on curves. On acceleration it gives a powerful purr and takes off like a rocket.  By far this is the best luxury sedan I ever owned and I've owned lots of luxury sedans.
lincoln,mkz,2007,Dick , 06/09/2007,A good start,4,"I am a prior Lincoln owner and a most recent Toyota Avalon owner. So far the two are about equal with the Lincoln feeling more solid. Acceleration is good, but the Avalon seemed quicker.  Lincoln feels better on the long trips.  Large back seat seemed wasted in the Avalon which has less trunk space.  Lincoln handles better around the curves."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Maryland, 07/27/2007,Very Happy with My New Lincoln,4,"I replaced a 1996 Subaru Legacy with a new MKZ. I wanted greater comfort with the safety of all-wheel drive, and the MKZ met my requirements best. It is very comfortable to drive, has plenty of power, and gets good comments on its appearance. So far, after 5 months, I have had no problems at all with this car. I would recommend it to anyone."
lincoln,mkz,2007,n33437, 08/07/2007,A Very Nice Car,4,At 3700 miles in 4 months this car has performed to expectations.  1300 mile trip from fl to nyc was a pleasure with one exception (see below). Gas consumption very good on highway
lincoln,mkz,2007,LadyCobra65, 08/17/2007,"Comfortable, fun, fantastic car",5,"MKZ AWD driven 120 miles a day with frequent road trips avg 6+ hours in the car. Seating comfort was #1 priority, followed by fuel economy. The 10-way power seat can sit upright eleminating stress on the lower back. Average mpg 25 commute, 27 trip, city 23. Handles nicely, quick excelleration, fun to drive. The controls are all in easy to reach/use places. The upgraded convenience featrues are new must haves. Dual driver memory on the seats/mirrors programmed to the keyfob/keyless entry pad; auto dimming rearview and side mirrors; well lighted entry; cooled leather seats! MKZ has many options you can program to your liking. THX stereo system provides amazing sound. Highly recommend this car."
lincoln,mkz,2007,billsbuddie, 06/17/2007,Right sized Lincoln,4,"The MKZ not only looks good but it comes very well equipped.  The only option that I paid for was the cooled seats, which have already come in handy here in Kansas."
lincoln,mkz,2007,Dr. RHK, 11/23/2007,Superb value,5,"Superb value for the money with all the typical luxury features which would cost $3-6K more on comparable models. I gave up a BMW 740i [drove for 8 years] and have driven numerous BMW 300 series. I was looking for a smaller car since my kids are grown up and wanted to downsize  with the following criteria: a] reliable b] safe c] fun to drive. The computer came up with BMW, Audi, Acura & Lincoln. When I saw the Lincoln, I thought you must be joking, but I researched all, test drove and picked the Lincoln. It's a choice I have not regreted; I am enormously satisfied with the handling, comfort, THX system and reliability. It's a sharp, sporty luxury car. Firm ride so might not fit all buyers."
lincoln,mkz,2008,weekst11, 01/07/2011,2008 MKZ FWD,4,"After having the vehicle for 3 years now with 58K on the odometer I thought that now was a appropriate time for a real world review, and this is what I found.

I have had ZERO issues with reliability and have gotten everything I wanted out of the car. True, it is not exactly the most stylish car out there(pales in comparison to say a CTS) but also costs a good 10K less. Gas mileage has been 23.3 avg over highway (80mph) and city. I do about 20K miles a year. 

The heated and cooled seats are a fovorite in the winter/summer, I know it sounds somewhat rediculous to have A/C seats but trust me...when summer gets here it is a wonderful perk!

Great car for the money."
lincoln,mkz,2008,John, 01/29/2016,I'll never buy anything else,5,"I love my 08 MKZ. Heated seats are amazing. Sometimes they get a little to hot. I know what I'll be getting when it's time for a new one.

I looked at BMW, Mercedes, Audi and I still liked the Lincoln vehicles better.
The options and value are by far the best on the market.
Since I have bought mine 2 of my friends have purchased similar Lincolns.
First and foremost I am a Ford fan, and Lincoln has just earned a my business for years to come."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Kim, 09/24/2018,Love this car!,5,"I bought this car as a back up so I had something more efficient to drive than my Jeep. This car is so comfortable to drive that it has become my daily driver. I recently returned from a road trip with the car where I calculated nearly 29 mpg. This car is dependable. I know I will drive it forever.
"
lincoln,mkz,2008,R, 11/30/2018,Excellent snow machine and more !,5,"Although not the most ‘beautiful’ car in the world, this vehicle is quite amazing. Throughout the entire length of ownership only one major issue happened at 120k miles(which ended up not being a big deal at all). It was a power steering leak because a hose had unattended at the clamp. At nearly 7 in. of ground clearance to the center brace on the frame together with it’s AWD system this car does so much better in the snow than it’s looks would perceive. This is a very reliable car. The only thing that disappoints me of this car is the chrome wheels. If you live in a place like I do that receives a moderated amount of snow - with all the salt and slush the chrome has basically disintegrated and peeled down to the bare metal. Very cheap quality wheels. Nonetheless if you’re looking at this car to purchase used I would say go for it! It’s really a good car.
"
lincoln,mkz,2008,Bill H., 09/13/2010,Great car for the money,4,"I went to the dealer to buy a Fusion or Milan, but loved the MKZ as soon as I saw it.  The interior is beautiful, the engine is strong and it has all the options of a much more expensive car.  I have been on several road trips and have found it to be a very comfortable ride and the gas mileage is better than average.  Overall, I love almost everything about my new Lincoln as does everyone who takes a close enough look at it.  Great job on this one Ford!!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,bigbaby, 07/02/2011,I bought it after the 39 month lease,4,"""Test drove"" it for the 39 month lease, then bought it for the residual price, which was thousands less than similar retail prices on used ones. It's just a great car. Many features for the buck, and everything works. Quiet, comfortable, spacious trunk with fold down rear seats, A/C seats are wonderful in North Texas."
lincoln,mkz,2008,J Betten, 08/28/2007,2008 MKZ AWD,5,"I drive more than 40,000 miles per year.  I chose this car over all other premium sedans, which I did test drive.  I'm very pleased with everything about the car and feel it's under-priced compared to other luxury sedans. Handling is great!  Interior is very quiet. Power is good for a v6 awd  Comfort and ride quality are excellent.  THX Stereo is Fantastic!  GPS is somewhat intuitive, but interactive system is great.  The only drawback is the lack of blue tooth phone, which may come later.  I coincidentally bought one of the first off the assembly line.  I found that this car is the best for the money - $10000-15000 price difference to other makes."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Bob, 10/17/2010,No better entry level luxury car.,5,"My Lincoln MKZ replaced a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria.  I thought that the smaller size of the Lincoln MKZ would be disappointing, but it is not at all.  The MKZ weighs only 200 lbs less than the 1999 Crown Victoria and the ride is great.  "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Richie rich, 08/29/2016,luxury meets affordablelity,5,"The ride is comfortable. I love the drivers seat that is programmable for 2 drivers. Just push a button and seat goes to your drive setting. Love everything about this car.

lincoln,mkz,2008,Bill, 02/04/2010,An Excellent Luxury Mid Size Sedan,5,"Purchased the MKZ after two months of research.  Looked at all of the luxury models, domestic and import.  The MKZ offers the best value for the dollar.  Recently drove a 2010 as a loaner from the dealer; was not pleased with the recent changes, although cosmetic in most cases.  The only feature worth noting on the 2010 is the dash lighting.  It is exceptional.  But overall, not the vehicle the 2008 is. Also; fuel economy is excellent.  I am able to achieve 33 mpg on the Interstates at speeds up to 70 mph.  City driving is in the 18-21 range, but that is just about average for any mid size V-6.  "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Dave, 03/09/2010,New Lincoln Owner,5,"I just purchased this car and am very impressed with it. I've already driven 100 miles and the gas gauge has barely moved so I'm hoping for some good MPG once I refill. The THX sound system is wonderful and has so many useful features that I'm still learning. I love the light colored interior and the heated and cooled seats are the best. My other car choices were a 2009 Camry SE and 2011 Hyundai Sonata. Those cars are also good but this Lincoln had more features for a lot less money. Even though it's basically a Ford Fusion, I like saying I own a Lincoln. Little more prestigious."
lincoln,mkz,2008,big baby, 03/20/2010,2 plus years of love,4,"This has been the most trouble free car I've owned, and that includes Lexus, Acura, Infiniti. Change the oil, put gas in, stick the key in and start, enjoy miles of smiles. I get a lot of looks and comments about the exterior. Strong V6, great 6 speed transmission, comfortable ride. If you can find a used one at a decent price and with a clean record, buy it!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,Don, 02/05/2018,Bought Used,5,"Purchased the MKZ used with 120,000 miles.  vehicle is solid runs feels and looks great. Comfort is excellent.  The only thing I noticed is that at lower speeds right around 20 miles per hour there is a vibration. It seems to warm up and stop doing this after it drives a while. As you speed up it stops. I’ve read that a new rear 2 piece drive shaft will fix this issue. The 2 piece drive shaft is 433 dollars for the part. In almost all cases this has fixed the problem. Wish Lincoln would make a recall but they have not done so yet. In any event I plan on replacing the driveshaft part from this website. https://www.wholesaleimportparts.com/Lincoln_MKZ_Driveshaft.php?gclid=Cj0KCQiAnuDTBRDUARIsAL41eDrjw9QT5f1Y4eykQY6ROt8YgggtZyArrxXtCoVYsACxGu_-zne2XlcaAgwVEALw_wcB                                                  Hope this review helps. The car is really fantastic. I’m very happy with it. At 120,000 miles it still looks and rides great. I will post again when my part is replaced.

Well had the part replaced for free under the used car dealers terms and could not be more happy. The drive shaft did eventually develop a loud banging you could feel and hear in the cockpit. The problem was the original 3 piece drive shaft. It was replaced with a re manufactured 2 piece drive shaft and is back running sweet again. Love the Car and the dealer PAAUTOSELECT.COM was excellent.

lincoln,mkz,2008,bailey, 01/26/2019,Best Car I’ve ever owned,5,"I upgraded to an 08 MKZ from a basic trim 06 jetta and fell in love. It had 116k miles when purchased, and it saw the repair shop one time during the year I owned it. A battery cable had gone bad and cost $38 to fix. I drive about 500 miles a week, and this car was extremely reliable. Sadly I lost this car to a deer totaling it but I would 100% reccomend it to anyone looking to purchase an older luxury car for an affordable price. One downfall I would say would be the MPG, but that was because I switched from the jetta and was used to 30+ MPG. I did find the driver seat to be kind of uncomfortable, I could never get my seat in a comfortable position. The SYNC feature was one of my favorites. Heated/AC seats were amazing. Sound system was spectacular for stock speakers.

lincoln,mkz,2008,Gredblg, 01/11/2009,My Little Smoothie,4,"After having cars in my life that could spin tires from a stop light or carry loads of lumber, I decided that I needed a smoother, quieter, more luxurious car. I am in my car everyday as a sales guy, so I wanted something that would make my very active day a pleasant, calming experience. I got everything I wanted and more in my beautiful, Tuxedo Black Lincoln. I enjoy the smooth,velvety,quick 0-60, the library quiet cabin, the 14 speaker THX stereo with voice activated everything, the heated/cooled seats, the huge amount of room and the subtle, tasteful design that people compliment me on almost daily. Great job, Ford. Who needs a stipped down, bland, boring Lexus for the same price?     "

I drive 40 miles each way to work, at 70-75 mph I'm getting a solid consistent 29 mpg.We recently took a 1200 mile vacation and found the car the most relaxing comfortable vehicle I have ever owned. The power is equal/exceeds comparable Mercedes, BMW and Cadillac. The price was approximately $10,000. less then the above mentioned. This car is much more then a Ford upgrade.  "
lincoln,mkz,2008,MJ Collins, 06/30/2010,A stylish work-horse!,5," I love this car - have only had it 7 months and have driven it in all sorts of road/weather conditions.  Recently took a major road trip (5000+ miles) without any trouble or hint of a problem. It is SO comfortable and stylish - not sure why there aren't more on the roads!My every driving wish seems to be its command - it is very responsive.  You get a whole lot for your money with this car and I am looking forward to it being as good as the 11 year old Town Car that I traded in at 192,000+ miles.  Why buy foreign cars when Lincoln is the best money can buy - and as American as baseball!  Love my car - or did I already say that? ;))"
lincoln,mkz,2008,lewis k berne, 06/14/2008,Equals a Mercedes Benz,5,"My last car was a 2006 Mercedes Benz E350. It was a wonderful car and well it should be for $55,000.00. The standard equipment of the MKZ far exceeds the E. (leather seats, A/C and heated seats, a super sounding standard audio system, back up sensors) On a day to day basis, handling is more than comperable. This did surprise me. No charge for maint. and $200 to $400 less per month on a lease than the C or E respectively, makes this car as my choice, a no brainer."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Holly, 08/19/2008,The Best Car I Have Ever Had!,4,I love my AWD MKZ.  It handles beautifully and is a fun car to drive! This is my fourth Lincoln and won't be my last. I had 3 Continentals prior to this car and loved every one of them but this car is a perfect fit for me. I feel so safe and grounded in this car and it takes curves better than the Lexus GS that I have driven so often. MKZ is a great value for the money. The only thing I am slightly disappointed in is the gas mileage but with just 6300 miles on it I am told it will still improve. MKZ is a lot of car for the money.  I am a loyal domestic owner!

lincoln,mkz,2008,Hunter, 12/29/2015,Worth considering,4,"In short, financed an '08 in Vapor Silver w/ AWD fully loaded with 39k back in 2012. Ended up having a cracked engine block which caused a cam sensor to fail, the steering wheel to lockup and the car unable to drive at 123k miles. Sad as I liked the car. I don't have any bad feelings toward the Lincoln brand as the car was reliable aside from that incident and I don't believe that every Lincoln will have this issues.

Good highlighta,
Loved the styling, 
powerful V6 engine, 
great compliments about the car from strangers,
how reliable the car was,
 AWD was helpful, 
ventilated seats are awesome, 
THX II stereo was amazing, 
Sync/Nav system works better  than Toyota products and the quality of the paint and leather are great. 

Areas of improvement
The ride wasn't as smooth as I had hoped, 
the interior materials weren't great
Xenon headlights could have been positioned to aim higher up and project more light as the MKS does,
No folding exterior mirrors,
Gas guzzler,
Seats aren't wide and I'm a slim guy.

My engine issue aside, I encourage others to give this car a shot. It'a great car.

lincoln,mkz,2008,heimerlr, 02/15/2009,Lincoln has it going!,4,Traded an AWD VW Passat for the AWD MKZ. MKZ much more comfortable to drive. The VW felt like I was sitting 1 inch off the road and had to fall down to get into the car. MKZ AWD makes it up a 15 degree grade in a foot of snow! Very smooth ride and plenty of zip!
lincoln,mkz,2008,Chris, 07/21/2010,Downgraded,3,"We traded in a 1994 6 cyl.Buick Park Avenue for the 2008 6 cyl. The PA had the most comfortable interior, GREAT gas mileage 27 mpg. All the bells and whistles. The Lincoln MKZ listed 18/28 but so ar has only 17/21. MKZ is zippy but the front seats are not comfortable on long trips.  The MKZ price was about 5g more than it should have been. The MKZ is NOT the car that the Buick was. Wish we had not purchased it now that we have experienced it. Buick is much better!!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,john, 07/26/2008,Nice but...,4,"Not a bad car but, the Lincoln LS had a lot more going for it. Where is the power articulating steering wheel? Why doesn't the ""Easy Exit"" go all the way back? Any kind of pull down for the trunk would be welcomed. The front of the headliner across the windshield seems to be missing a trim piece. It's kind of raggedy along the edge. No AC vents for the back seat. Even my VW has that. Mileage seems par for the niche. I do like the ride, and I like the look of it. Not a bad car just fell short here and there. Still a good buy for the price. "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Jim, 07/06/2008,Very Pleased,5,Very pleased with the MKZ. The ride is great and the comfort is excellent. Have had many compliments on the car. MPG is in the mid-20's.

lincoln,mkz,2008,angiejo, 07/25/2008,Love it!,4,I did a lot of research prior to buying MKZ. I liked what I read about MKZ so I bought one. I love my MKZ. The ride is very nice. Consumer report graded it high also. Gas mileage not too bad (mid 20s). For now there isn't a luxury riding car with outstanding gas mileage. I opted for luxury. Don't have to travel that far.  
lincoln,mkz,2008,Lois, 01/10/2009,Love mine,4,I am very satified with this car. The quality was better than the others in this price range. I love the sync radio system and the sound is clear. I bought the FWD for better gas mileage and have driven it in a few inches of snow and it seems fine. I love the air conditioned seats. Lots of room in the trunk and a quiet ride. It is not as much fun as my BMW 528i was to drive when I was lucky enough to have it running. The oil changes and routine maintenence is cheap compared to BMW. This is the first American made luxury car I have owned in quite a while. I always liked the chrome. This had nice details and a eye catching look. 
lincoln,mkz,2008,steve, 03/11/2009,Rims,4,the mkz is a great car overall but we had to have three rims replaced do too hitting minor pot holes that other cars went over I believe these rim are defective and are not the quality that you would expect on a lincoln so far the answer I get from Fords is it is a insurance claim or cash out of my pocket too the tune of $600.00 dollars all rims were in a four month period with two of them less thsn two weeks apart and happened on major roads even fords admits its very unusual for three rims in a short period to go bad.
lincoln,mkz,2008,DAVE, 01/06/2008,Best Ever,5,"This is simply the best car I've ever owned - and I've owned many.  I just got out of an '04 Lincoln LS, which was great.   I wasn't pleased that Lincoln stopped making them and decided to shop the field. I test drove many.  I went with the MKZ and could not be happier. There is really no comparison.  There is nothing that comes close to the MKZ at this price point.   If you're even slightly considering the MKZ, don't hesitate. If not, you should. You will be shocked at how great this car is.  By far the nicest, most comfortable, quietest ride I've had in over 30 years of driving. "

The SYNC system is outstanding and  provides the bluetooth capability some reviewers were asking for. On the other hand there are a lot of things that say Ford/Mercury and not Lincoln. The floor mats define cheap. The seats are not comfortable for long periods. The center console is too far rearward to rest elbow when driving. Transmission sometimes gives very sudden/harsh down shifts. And worst of all, there is a very annoying powertrain vibration/resonance at 2000 rpm that produces both an audible noise and tactile feel in steering wheel/gas pedal.  "

In addition, the seat positioning does not work from the key all the time. Lincoln (Ford) refuses to repair problem that are not seen by the dealer.

As soon as it came out of the dealership I drove straight to Cadillac and traded it in for a CTS, before the warranty expires and it falls apart on me!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,Disappointed, 12/18/2008,Not so Impressive,2,"I have owned the MKZ for all of 45 days, to say the least, I was impressed with the outward appearance and the interior features for the price. After purchase, I noticed several items of poor workmanship. As a previous Honda, Infiniti and Lexus owner, you recognize quality. This car is not quality built, I am afraid if I pull or push on something too hard I might damage it. I've had problems with the seal around the windows to the point objects have gotten down inside the seal and window and scratched the glass. This area also accumulates moisture and the windows are left dirty once you let them down after rain or car washing. "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Mike38, 07/22/2009,NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED A LINCOLN,3,Bought my first used car.  After many miles in a full size Lincoln via a former employer I gave the little MKZ a try for my wife.  I liked the looks and it only had 6K miles as a former spotless fleet car.  Was enjoying the car until we went on a 300 mile trip to Florida.  My wife was the first to say my GMC Sierra  truck rode a whole lot smother with much more comfortable seats. Never have liked the foreign type tilting wheels very limited positions and sorry but better in the GMC Truck.  I do like the way the seats lay down way back but are not very comfortable when down. Over all nice car but far from being worthy to carry the Lincoln name.
lincoln,mkz,2008,James, 05/11/2008,L Is for Lemon not Lincoln,1,"I bought this car brand new, ive had too many problems with it. Let me start with the small things, I needed new weather stripping on all my Windows about 500 miles in, then I started to hear howling noises from the car, ive had 2 new fuel pumps and its still howling, a light nudge actually made the tansmission shifter knob break off, door panels look loose, and it Burns oil too quickly, I filed a lemon law suit in March and bought a new Cadillac cts in April, so far so good with that."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Jules Valdez, 07/25/2008,Nice Car,4,Really fun to drive. Lots of power. Stereo system and Sync are awesome. I get many compliments from people when they see this car. Owned a Caddy before. I like this better.
lincoln,mkz,2008,rjf, 04/15/2008,Great Vehicle and a great value,4,The car is relatively new and it has been a great ownership experience. The car is very quiet and smooth. The interior is very comfortable and stylish although I wish the dash and door graining was done better. The no money down lease program and price made a great car a great deal
lincoln,mkz,2008,ioregan, 05/31/2008,Fun for the money!,4,"I've owned my MKZ for about 3 months, took one 1,000 mile road trip with it. Verdict so far: Excellent. The car is beautiful inside and out, ride is very comfortable, engine can get up and go. THX sound system is the best thing I've ever heard in a vehicle, and voice-activated music is just hilariously fun. Looked at a Buick and the Cadillac CTS, but the MKZ gave me the most bang for my buck, and I'm one satisfied customer."
lincoln,mkz,2008,mkz fan, 06/20/2008,Made the right choice,5,"I obsessed endlessly between BMW 328; Mercedes C series; CTS, Lexus Es and I35. Finally chose MKZ for its costs, fuel (regular) and full set of options. After nearly 4k miles, I couldn't be happier. Plenty of power, comfort and impressive fuel economy. SYNC needs to be linked with correct phone but after that it is wonderful as is the THX system. Car responds better than others tested and I have had more positive comments than I have had with any other car. Great on long trips and agile in city. Trunk clicks open and I've not encountered any problem with it. Everything else has worked perfectly and dealer couldn't be more responsive. Even comparing with the MKS, I'm sure of my choice. "
lincoln,mkz,2008,jack c, 06/24/2008,Very happy,4,I have had the MKZ for 1 month and love it. Fuel mileage could be better in city but better than my Subaru on highway. Hope it gets better after break in. 
lincoln,mkz,2008,big baby, 06/29/2008,5 month update,4,"What a great car! Only problem I've had is a very slight pull to the right which I'll take care of at the first service. On a trip from Dallas to Houston I got almost 32 MPG with the cruise set at about 68. Back home which is a bit uphill, and with a strong headwind got 28.5 MPG. Day to day driving which is about 80% city and 20% highway, the gauge has been sitting at 22.7 MPG for about a month. On regular gas! After living with it for a time I think the dash design needs an update (maybe like the new MKS?) but I can live with it. Engine is strong, tranny is super smooth. Trunk is large and the fold down rear seats really have been helpful. Ford has hit a grand slam on this puppy!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,kinsellj, 07/28/2008,My Little Lincoln,4,"This car met these criteria when I shopped: Under $30K, reg gas, leather, good gas mileage, bluetooth, American. There is no perfect car, but this one is really good. If the tranmission allowed it to be more responsive at highway speeds (acceleration), it would be darn close. It does not have the rock solid handling of my 2004 Accord Coupe, but actually gets around turns at the same speeds. At $26.5K it was the right choice. Sync is great, the standard stereo is good (I wish I got the THX). It is the best looking car I have owned."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Cindy, 12/18/2007,I love this car!,4,"I first owned a 2006 Zephyr, and experienced some minor problems, so upgraded to the 2008 MKZ, and so far, the problems are corrected.  The car is awesome.  I went from owning white, to vivid red, and it is GORGEOUS!!!  A winner!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,Jerry, 08/13/2008,2008 MKZ Fantastic,4,"I'm 29, 6' tall, and I was going to buy a used Zephyr because I've never bought a new car before. I test drove the Zephyr and it was fine, then I test drove the MKZ, and I ended up buying a new 2008 MKZ! The safety features were explained, and they are thorough down to the ""air-bag curtains"" that drop to shield everyone from broken glass. I have a 1 yr old son. The design may be bland, but other cars like the Lexus are too. The curves of an Acura are nice, but otherwise it's bland.  I actually like the design. Not elegant, but luxury and strength. The chrome is nicely placed on the side mirrors and underneath windows across the doors. I love the light leather, dark gray dash, ebony wood."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Dave, 09/06/2008,Very nice mid-size auto,4,A nice mid-sized car with a very smooth ride. The MKZ has a very nice interior except for the color of the wood trim--too light.  The telescoping steering wheel is a nice touch and the THX stereo system with the navigation is really great.
lincoln,mkz,2008,ARGUS, 09/11/2008,Best buy,5,"I'm frugal, was researching CTS and Edmunds compare showed MKZ. I needed more rear leg room than CTS. Couldn't believe price! All compareables cost several thousand more and wanted more up front (lease). Plenty of power, I don't need manual mode shift! Air cond. seats a dream in Fla. Great ride, no problems or complaints. I've owned for 4 months. Always driven new cars or lux trucks. Trips of 1100 mi cruise on 75mph netted 28mpg, city 19- 20mpg w/reg Gas. Nice touches like ctr consol lid slides forword for arm rest on trips. And Real wood dash not plastic."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Ann, 10/07/2008,An elegant ride!,4,"I had two Jaguars prior to the MKZ and they could not hold a candle to the elegance, features and handling of the MKZ. I love the wood trim, reminds me of the Bentley interior. Will definitely buy another and would recommend to anyone."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Rip Reed, 12/19/2008,Great Deal,5,I have had this car for almost one year and I cannot express how happy I am with it. The ride is quiet and smooth. 
lincoln,mkz,2008,Rich Weller, 01/01/2008,First Time In A Lincoln,5,I have never owned a Lincoln and now I am sorry I didn't consider one sooner.  First of all this car is stunning to look at.  I have gotten nothing but great comments from people seeing this car for the first time. The inside is plush with great features at a price that rivals any entry level luxury sedan.  If you are in the market for this car make sure you get a model that has the Microsoft SYNC system built in. The earlier 2008 models did not have this.  Now it is included as a standard feature.  My understanding is that the cars coming on the dealers lots that have the SYNC system are the first to be sold.
lincoln,mkz,2008,JAG, 01/25/2008,A Must Drive,5,I really wanted a 2008 CTS before driving this car. Coming out of an 05 LS I was not considering another lincoln. I shopped cadillac first and also Audi A6. While the A6 was bigger and the Caddy had more awards Lincoln blew both away with the price. Fully loaded this vehicle prices 10-15K below the other two. The ride is quiet and has ample power. The 6 speed automatic transmission is as smooth as could be. The SYNC system is unbelievable and the THX stereo is amazing. I love driving this car and I really love all the money I saved. If you can check your ego at the door and try this car you won't be dissapointed. 
lincoln,mkz,2008,Bob, 09/15/2009,Great Car,5,I love the car.  It is very well styled and comfortable and fun to drive.  I've received many compliments from outsiders.
lincoln,mkz,2008,charles, 10/09/2009,mkz-nice,5,"was driving a mercury sable, but missed the lincoln ride, dealer made me a nice offer on the mkz,whats not to like styling, ride, interior design,just a sweet ride,was not disappointed with this purchase,would I buy again?  you bet !! ford got this one right."
lincoln,mkz,2008,don, 02/01/2008,Actual experience,4,"Traded in a 2004 TL automatic. MKZ has a better ride by far.  Sync works much better than the TL voice system, seats are more comfortable, more adjustable, trunk is bigger back seat more comfortable and the air conditioned seats are by far the best thing going.  Long drives they come in real handy."
lincoln,mkz,2008,big baby, 02/21/2008,Early ownership review,4,"Moved out of a small SUV because I wanted to go back to sedans for the ride, comfort and better gas mileage. I researched the heck out of the market (love the actual owner reviews rather than the editors, who only like driver's cars like BMW). Looked into Taurus, Sable, Malibu, Aura, Milan, and MKZ. Got the MKZ due to incredible standard content, price, and importantly (in Texas), the standard air conditioned seats. Bought at cost less $2000 rebate. It's an unbelievable value. Quiet, smooth, fast, roomy. It's got it all for the price of a loaded Accord or Camry!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,Alice, 02/21/2008,New Lincoln MKZ makes me want to drive,5,"I just love my new MKZ.  I was all set to buy a Honda Accord V6, but with my friends telling my to buy American I thought I'd test drive the MKZ and ended up walking out with one.  Everything is super.  I am so excited about this car.  I love the features like beautiful interior, SYNC with hands free bluetooth phone, satalite radio, and heated and cooled seats.  The car is so comfortable.  It handles great and fuel economy seems good so far.  The best thing is that it was and incredible value.  It was by far better than the Honda and I'm loving it.  The dealer was super.  Only problem is that I just want to drive.  It is just fun. "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Lincoln MKZ, 11/10/2007,Best New car I ever owned.,5,"The outside and interior design is the best Ford Motor Co, ever has done for a new car in many years. The modern instrumentation is excellent with the added benefit of very modern computer that manages many of the previous problems like air prressure in the tires, oil, and other areas too numerous to name. Comfort is also excellent with the added benefit of the memory system in the driver's seat and outside mirror positions. The trunk size is extremely large and with the fold down rear seat backs adds excellent space. The steering wheel design is an extra design I really like. "
lincoln,mkz,2008,ZMan, 11/30/2007,An Excellent Choice,5,"I researched just about everything currently available. I could not find anything, American or import, that matches value received for dollars spent. If you want a luxury vehicle, mid size, that offers excellent comfort, convenience features, and outstanding fuel economy on 87 octane, look no more. I only have 2000 miles on the vehicle, and I am already getting advertised fuel economy, plus. Recent trip on the PA Pike; 31 mpg at 65 mph. This vehicle is very attractive, well built, easy to handle, very quiet on the road, and continues the prestige associated with the Lincoln brand.    "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Mitch in N.C., 12/02/2007,Love it and you will too!!,5,"I have owned Ford's and Mercury's for 20 years, this is my first Lincoln. It is a great value in this class compared to others with less standard features and a much higher price[4000- 10,000]. I am very happy wiyh fuel mileage, ride, handling, features and it's quiet inside. It is a great looking car outside and many people ask about it."
lincoln,mkz,2008,sport99, 03/15/2008,L is for Lincoln not Lexus!,4,"Just took delivery of my MKZ AWD after months of researching BMW, M-B, Jaguar X Type and Audi A4.  Lincoln offers far more value for the money than any of the others. Exterior styling is far better than past lincoln's and the interior finally resembles the high level that lincoln of the past was noted for. This car comes with almost everything standard. In Canada where i live it is also sold with 4 year fully paid up scheduled maintenance so all i have to do is put gas in it and insure it.  THX II Certified Audio is a must have. Quality is as good as any import. I really suggest if you are looking for an entry level luxury sedan..check out the MKZ. you won't find a better deal on the market"
lincoln,mkz,2008,TommyDavis, 03/20/2008,Lincoln is back.,4,"I am definitely not the target consumer for Lincoln as I am well under age 65 (under 30, actually), but after owning an AccordV6, an Acura TL and a Lexus ES, and putting 100k miles on each, I drove the MKZ. I was initially drawn by the price, but when I drove it, I was hooked. I have had it 2 months (and 5k miles) and it's by far the best car I have owned insofar as initial quality and handling. The SYNC system really works and rarely misunderstands a command. Oh and get this: I bought the base model-- absolute no additional options. Very very impressed with the car, the value and the deal I was able to get on the vehicle. Looking forward to my next Lincoln in 2011!  "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Mavreek, 03/22/2008,Loving It!,4,"I had 2 Infiniti G35's from '03-'08, Needed to cut down on expenses, and got MKZ - Test drove a ton of others + this was by far the best value! Better, Smoother Ride (I drive a ton), Handles failing roads much better, better gas mileage, cheapter to insure, Better sound system (Get the THX - Its Hot!), better seating (ventilated, heated + cooled seats)! I'm 6'3 and I fit much better in it! But the best thing by far is the SYNC system - Its truly the most inovative system I've ever seen! I wanted an American, started with CTS but found this to be the best choice for the budget! Thought I was downgrading, but I find the oposite is true and I'm in love with this car and I'm a car guy!!"
lincoln,mkz,2008,One Happy Owner, 04/05/2008,A Lincoln For All To Enjoy,5,This is a very fun car to drive. The AWD system really helps out when taking corners or taking off the line. The dashboard is nice a bright at night and the controls are easy to use. The 6 speed shifts very smoothly and never misses a beat. I really love the 600 watt THXII sound system. Every tone is nice and clear. The seats are more than comfortable for long trips. The sync system is simply flawless. The heated and cooled seats are one of the best features on this car. The engine has a hard time getting going off the line but the power really kicks in fast. So far I'm getting about 18 MPG in the city and 22 MPG on the freeway at 80mph. This car really holds its own and you would enjoy it. 
lincoln,mkz,2008,the best! , 04/09/2008,Love it!,5,"Great car, just had it for about a month. Love the interior and the sync system, even though at first it was a little hard to understand. I love the gas mileage of this car. Traded in my Navigator for this car. That car which averaged about 14 mpg, while I'm getting about 23.4 in my 2008 mkz awd. "
lincoln,mkz,2008,Bob, 04/18/2008,"Beautiful for the price, none better",5,"I just bought the car and have received many comments from co-workers on how beautiful it is. I feel very comfortable in this smaller car, my previous car was a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria, a much larger car.  I don't feel you can find anything better or more beautiful for the price."
lincoln,mkz,2008,FL5100, 05/03/2008,Fun Classy Car,4,"Bought this car on a Wednesday and drove it from Minnesota to Detroit that Friday.  2 adults, 2 kids (3 & 5), dog (18lbs).  Tight Compared to our 2000 Expedition, but 27 MPH out of the box (70-75 mph, w/ strong head wind) vs. 15-16 mpg hwy in Expedition. The THX II cert. stereo made the drive more enjoyable and controlling the I- Pod with the SYNC system w/ voice commands was fun for all! The HID Lights are a must, simply awesome! The ride was very smooth and quite.  I'm 6- 1 and the head room is not what I'm use to, but w/ some adjusting I found the helm to be acceptable (Wife 5-3, she thought it was perfact, by the way, this is her car). Trunk space is great, good room for a weekend out."
lincoln,mkz,2008,Ben Youngblood, 04/23/2017,Best car I've ever owned,5,"While not flashy in appearance, the MKZ is an incredibly high value car considering it is nice looking, comfortable, performs well, and incredibly reliable.  I bought the car used with 50K miles and now up to 85K. Nothing but regular maintenance at a 7,500 interval. I've owned 2 Hondas, 2 Infinitis, a Mazda, and a chevy. The MKZ is easily the best all around and returns the greatest value. If looking for a high value used sedan, there are many low mileage 2010-2012 models available.

lincoln,mkz,2008,Buyer, 08/11/2020,MKZ,3,A stretch of the imagination is required to consider this a luxury sedan. Plain Jane interior and instrumentation along with no rear a/c disappoint.
lincoln,mkz,2009,chuck s, 08/08/2015,my hot rod Lincoln,4,"Bought used with 74,000 miles. Have driven for 5,000 miles with no problems. Very comfortable. Handles well in part to AWD. Could use a little more power. Difficult to see controls below the radio. Very small and not intuitive. Climate control works very well but would be easier to use with a knob to turn and set  highway temp. We drive 85% highway and get 21.5 mpg. I use a mobility scooter and it breaks down and fits in the trunk with room left over.
update 85,000 miles...Have found a leak under the carpet since we finally started getting rain. It's on the front passenger side. have to take it in to see what the problem is. 95k miles... several problems with front suspention expensive!!!! Update 103,000 miles. Almost 2 years since purchased. still runs well. everything still works. No additional problems. suspenstion cost $110 to fix. not too bad.
Update 114,500 miles. No additional problems. Just bought new conte tires. Runs quieter and got 1 mpg better. Use full synth. oil. seems to keep engine clean and running well.
124,500 update. change oil, filter, and air filter abt. every 7,500 miles.
Update 139,500 Still no major mechanical problems. Just replaced brake pads all around. Going to have to replace tires soo

lincoln,mkz,2009,workingschmo, 01/14/2014,A GOOD WORK IN PROGRESS,4,"Bought my Lincoln used and got a great deal on it thus my high marks on value. However, would never buy this new because I believe Lincoln could've done better compared to the competition. First off is the trunk problem that many complain about. Poor design - you can live with it though. Second - the interior is definitely more Ford than lincoln and could use some more upscale touches. The OEM Brakes are a bit mushy but replacements improved that drastically. Now the good - car feels solid and handles wonderfully with a nice ride and quiet interior.
The navigation and SYNC work flawlessly and make this car a true pleasure. 70K miles and no problems whatsoever."

Bought used in 2015 with 50k miles on it. Runs great. Only problem was with the gumming up of the variable valve timing [VVT] cam advance due to low mileage and not using synthetic oil. Love the big bright tail lights. Dosen’t come standard with daylight running safety lights for some reason. Took it from Texas to Florida and it ran great down IH10. Wife likes the heated and cooled seats.

lincoln,mkz,2009,Wisconsin, 01/19/2009,Loving it,5,"So far, an excellent car.  Was between this, a SAAB 9-5 and Volvo S60. This car is superior hands down, great ride and very fun to drive. Classy interior with the dash vent open."
lincoln,mkz,2009,Coco, 11/28/2018,Steady Gal,4,"I know a lot of these Lincolns can be Lemons, but gosh I got lucky with mine.  I bought it at 100,000 Miles and in almost two years I have put on 80,000; still runs lovely.  Had some basic Maintenance issues such as fuses and front wheel baring.  But my gal has seen me to Colorado twice and Florida twice from Wisconsin.  Love the sound system, Bluetooth can be finicky though.  One bigger problem I had with it was about the sunroof stopped working on me and would of cost butt-load if I wanted to fix it since the way that its built in is difficult to get to.  I gritted my teeth and had it sealed shut.  They could of thought out the front area storage better than they did, but I'm no engineer.  This is a daily driver and gets a TON of use and the leather just started to crease/crack.  Big plus is it feels nice to drive, very smooth.  I will drive this car till I run it to the ground.

lincoln,mkz,2009,DGeorgia, 01/08/2009,Appears to be a good segment choice,4,"So far so good after a couple of days. Was considering Mercedes C300, Nissan Maxima, BMW.  The MKZ is by far the most bang for the buck.  Standard features top all others, uses 87 octane, and inexpensive to maintain with good warranty coverage. Only quirks so far are the reflection of light dashboard onto windshield in direct sunlight and the dash clock makes a funky little sound as it operates ( why? ) Solid road feel, quiet, comfortable, sharp looking."
lincoln,mkz,2009,Felix Runners, 01/14/2009,Great Entry Luxury Car,5,"This is a great entry-level luxury car. Lots of features for a low price. The engine has plenty of power, the SYNC system is user friendly, and the seats (back seats too) are comfortable for traveling. Thumbs up from the whole family."
lincoln,mkz,2009,VERY VERY NICE, 01/27/2010,ZERO COMPLAINTS,4,"Upgraded from a 2008 Fusion to this Lincoln.  This is a nice car.....period.  Plenty of power, excellent road feel, comfort, AWD excellent in snow, stereo rocks.!  Wish gas mileage was better (avg 21), but can't keep foot out of gas.  NO complaints so far."
lincoln,mkz,2009,John Rowe, 11/02/2017,Air bags,3,"I bought our 2009  2 years ago for the comfort and ride, almost immediately received the recall from Lincoln for the airbag from Takata. I received this week a notice that Takata is bankrupt both in Japan and US. Lincoln will not tell me if the replacement of the airbags will occur in my lifetime. I am certain they are building new cars with another non Takata airbag supplier. As you can imagine, the resale value with those airbags has diminished. While I am a safe driver, I still fear penetrating injuries from the ""safety"" feature, many in the face. If Ford can build new cars with airbags, why the long delay in repairing the problem for its established customers? All that being said, I enjoy using the car for long drives , mostly Wisconsin to Colorado {vacation home} and Tennessee {where my son was doing his residency} Those cooled seats are great on hot summer days and nights.
"
lincoln,mkz,2009,H. Ostwalt, 07/02/2010,Great Head Turner,4,"After reading Edmund's review, the Acura TL, Lexus ES350 & Maxima, mentioned in review, all cost more and require premium gas.  The MKZ does not, trunk is larger in MKZ too.  It is great, change the oil, put gas in it and enjoy the ride.  Fun to drive, quiet to ride in, good radio and blue tooth adapts to your cell phone.    I am well pleased with car.  Air condition seats are really fantastic in the South, in the summer! You just wouldn't believe it unless you try it!"
lincoln,mkz,2009,kzad, 07/26/2010,No parts available when it breaks,3,"We were happy with our Zephyr, so when the time came we traded for the MKZ. We were happy with it until 3,000 miles (yes, thats three thousand), when the traction control light came on. Dealer changed a sensor, after which the car wouldn't go over 30 mph. We were told they had a bad batch of these sensors, they are on nationwide back order.  That was two weeks ago. We have no idea when we will see the car again. "
lincoln,mkz,2009,Fred, 07/25/2008,Underappreciated American Gem,3,"I bought an MKZ, after considering the Lexus GS350, MB C-300, and Infiniti M35. I really wanted to like the ""cooler"" Infiniti or Lexus, but the quality of their ride did not match the MKZ's.  While not glamorous, the MKZ's looks are quite good, the Nav and Sync systems well thought out (confusing at first; I finally got my Palm Treo to sync, with minor bug.) You definitely get a lot for the money! It handles very well, almost as good as the GS350 (and better than the ES, IMHO).  The Satellite radio is terrific. A quality issue with the windshield, that may require replacement. But overall I am very pleased with my purchase."
lincoln,mkz,2009,marie, 12/22/2008,Love it!,4,"I was debating between a Volvo S40 and the MKZ. The MKZ was the better deal but also provided more head room. My requirements were comfortable, safe and something my husband would also enjoy driving. I went with the MKZ and I have not regretted it. I love my car, I feel like I finally have a real car for the first time. I already drove it in the snow and ice and it handled beautifully. I would recommend getting the brushed nickel interior- it looks awesome and much better than the tacky fake wood that is standard. Also love the bluetooth & the heated seats. There is also little to no road noise and gas mileage is okay- I get about 21mpg with a mix of highway and local driving.   "

Thus far my chief complaints are I find the width of front seats about 2 inches too narrow and the engine sounds too loud,like a 4 cyl. I suspect the engine sound is the result of the fan blades on the engine. Very annoying>>>> "
lincoln,mkz,2009,kydna, 12/14/2017,Does it run?,4,"My 2009 MKZ has just over 58,000 miles.  Had to have front brakes replaced at 54000. Now engine has a misfire for the second time. No reason for this issue.  Rear window defroster is bad. Back window has to be replaced to fix problem.  Drives seat warmer needs to be replaced. Car has spent more time in the repair shop than on the road. Will never buy another Lincoln or Ford product. The brake system that distributes the fluid gave out. 2 months of searching for a replacement part (new one was 1800.00). Part located from 2012 Fusion. Repair was made 2.5 months later. Car now has 65,000. No further issues at this point
  Now at 68,000 car has not had any current issues. Tire rotation and a leak repair smoothed the ride. 
    Car now has 72000 miles. No further issues have risen at this time.

lincoln,mkz,2009,wwarmbold, 07/14/2009,Needs some improvement.,3,"Having owned 2 Lincoln town cars previously, I was disappointed with comfort of seats and ride. Road noise very annoying. Lacks the quiet, lush ride I was used to. Poor use of storage space on front doors. Needs indentation on truck to raise and lower it. Trunk could be deeper."
lincoln,mkz,2009,Alan Krug, 05/17/2016,Very nice car,5,"Very nice, reliable vehicle.  Recommended.  It's built on the Fusion platform but they would have to melt down two Fusions to make one MKZ. Four years later, with 60,000 mils, it's still a great vehicle.  A classic.  Recommended.

The engine is also great. My biggest complaint though is the seats are too small, although comfortable and supportive. "
lincoln,mkz,2009,Ken_W, 08/02/2008,"Nice Car, Worth Checking Out",5,"I traded an '06 Zephyr for an '09 MKZ. I obviously liked the Zephyr well enough to come back for more! While the '06 was a bit underpowered, the engine change back in '07 took care of that. They finally added vehicle stability control in the '09. The MKZ is a good balance of price, comfort, and features.Gas mileage on my Zephyr averaged 24 mpg combined, the MKZ is already matching that with less than 2000 miles on it. I'm no hot rodder, but I don't waste any time on the road. MKZ isn't for everyone, but it's worth a look!  "
lincoln,mkz,2009,DGeorgia, 03/19/2009,3 months and losing steam,3,"The MKZ drives well, is comfortable, and gets decent MPG.  However, many gremlins have popped up over the last 2 months....2 broken trim pieces, replaced weather stripping due to wind noise, and multiple hard to isolate squeaks and rattles have dropped my opinion of this car down several notches.  One thing to consider:  Lincoln is till Ford and unfortunately you don't get stellar service due to this fact.  Like the drive, not sure I'll keep it due to lots of time spent in the shop due to annoying minor issues."

There were initial issues with pairing of cell phone, but the dealer and Ford were persistent in getting those resolved.
Since then, my wife and I have driven it 10,000 miles and love the car - fit, feel, handling, and performance.

Visibility out the back is not all that great and full use of the console controls takes some getting used to (probably true of any new car) by older folks (72).
Synch technology probably not quite ready for prime time."
lincoln,mkz,2010,JoeJoe123, 12/01/2017,The Best car I've owned,5,"Since 2000 I have bought and enjoyed following cars:  Cadillac STS, Infiniti I30, Lincoln LS, back to Infiniti Q45 and then back to Lincoln, this time 2010 MKZ. I bought it with 17K miles (I only buy 18-24 month old cars with few miles). I have owned this MKZ longer than any car, because it just won't quit! I have 260,000 hidgway miles and besides the basic oil change, tires, fluids and breaks I have not needed any repairs. All my other cars started giving me issues after 150k (especially Cadillac), but this baby not only has had no mechanical issues, but it rides as smooth as I first bought it. Gas mileage is still the same 26-27 on highway, unbelievable. Although the 2 newer body styles look awesome on MKZ I would still recommend the older MKZ (2010 - 2012) to anyone seeking to enjoy luxury on tight budget. I don't think you can beat the value. And by the way Lincoln (like some Buick models) is no longer an older person car. I got this when I was 33 and it served me extremely well as a young businessman.

I could see many improvements on the 2010, and I like the handling of the sport package. I like having a car that you don't see at every stop light. I get compliments on the car all the time. I like the size and performance of the mkz, and that it runs on 87 unleaded. I drove a Cadillac cts and when the same as the mks its $5,000 more. I also checked out the Buick lacrosse which is priced about the same as the mkz but didn't seem as nice."
lincoln,mkz,2010,Believer, 02/03/2010,All you need,4,I replaced my 2005 Chrysler hemi with this beautiful platinum white MKZ and could not be happier.  It is the base model without all the additional bells and whistles and has more than enough convenience and comfort.  27 MPG on the highway is great and the power is comparable to the hemi - after all the chrysler weighed about 600 lbs more. The ride is smooth and the interior quiet is better than my neighbors Lexus 350.
lincoln,mkz,2010,Bob, 04/28/2010,My 2010 MKZ vs. my '07 MKZ,4,"I just turned in my '07 MKZ lease and leased a new 2010 Lincoln MKZ. Overall I am relatively happy with my new MKZ -  performance, handeling, and ride have all improved, and the cosmetic changes for the most part are an improvement.  I can however see where Ford has cut some costs in producing the '10 vs. '07 while adding $5,000 to the base price in just 3 years. My biggest disappointment is in the poor audio unit now standard in the base MKZ, the same unit that comes in a Ford Escape, Fusion or other Ford/Mercury vehicle. While the whistles and bells such as Sync, USB, and Bluetooth Audio are all great, the most important aspect of any audio system - sound quality - is very disappointing."

lincoln,mkz,2010,StephenDIV, 10/22/2019,Owned 7 years & over 200K,5,"After thoroughly reviewing cars, I purchased a used (business leased) MKZ in 2012, with around 36K miles.  Since then it’s been my daily driver for the last 7 years, and currently sits with 217K miles on the odometer.
3 sets of tires, brakes, struts, 2 batteries, and soon to be a tie rod are all I’ve had to replace on the car- pretty low maintenance compared to most automobiles on the market in my opinion.  
Only thing that I have a complaint on is the door handles- have replaced 2 since owning and another one is going bad as we speak.   This is due to the internal parts all being plastic and not metal. Poor design, due to inferior parts, but not the end of the world. 
I bought the car due to large cabin room for a car.  I’m 6’4” and needed something I wouldn’t feel cramped in with kiddos filling the back seat most times. The seats are very comfortable, even on long trips. 
The MPG is reasonable- still getting mid 20s on my daily commute.
A little rust is showing up in front of the rear wheel wells (like every ford for the last 50 years).  
Had a few minor plastic interior parts break. 
Engine is still running like a top, and haven’t had any issues with the drive train either.  

I’d purchase this car again without question, possibly with the AWD feature, just for better handling in the snow. It’s been dependable, with little shop time and reasonable cost for upkeep. "

The passenger side fender is loose.  It came loose from where it is attached.  The   rims carode and cause the tires to leak via the rim.  Tail light recall, repaired by dealer.  Rear breaks done at 71,051 miles.  AC line leak at 71051 miles    Replaced at 71617 miles.  Replace inner driver side door handle.  A wire  on the rear defroster grid got broken, rubbed.

lincoln,mkz,2010,MKZ, 10/15/2010,2nd MKZ,4,"This MKZ replaced my 07 MKZ at lease end. Very pleased with the 07 so I opted for another. Basically identical cars but no AWD on the 2010. Better combined MPG 24.7 with the 2010 2wd vs 22 mpg on the 07 with AWD. The 2010 dual Climate control regulation is very poor. Appears to be a factory defect that cannot be corrected. I miss the 07 analog clock. There are too many distractions on the LCD display. I do not have Nav, so the display may be better with it. The radio and temp knobs are identical and too often I hit the wrong one. The sync feature keeps dropping my  bluetooth phone and requires  resetting. I have owned 33 American autos and one Porsche.  The 2010 MKZ gets an overall 8 rating."

I test drove/researched the Maxima, G37, XF, C class, 328/335, TL-S and A4. This is BY-FAR the best value for the money, and surprisingly great handling. I got this vehicle for cheaper than ALL of the above vehicles, while still getting more features than many above. And believe me, there is still plenty of acceleration for those in doubt. I have owned Lexus, Acura and Nissan and the build quality rivals all of the top names. Only quibble is the gas mileage, but probably b/c of my leadfoot. Great job Lincoln!"

Always a conversation piece with anyone who is looking at it or is in the car with me.  No outside noise.  You think the car is off.  How tight it corners and drives. How I love the voice activation, from choosing music to phone calls and the map guidance plus seeing behind you while backing up while safely looking forward at your map screen.

And yes the thing was based off of a Mazda 6. BUT I'm glad to be contributing to FoMoCo (American Holdings) who continues to improve leaps and bounds over the competition. It's my first nice car and is very comfortable for my long legs. Nice smooth-quiet ride. I'm happy with it. Lot's of nice features. I owned an 07 Taurus and it was a great car so I decided to give FoMoCo another go and I'm glad I did. Beefy car.

When I was looking to buy compared the MKZ to Nissan Maxima but to get memory seats you had to spend in excess of 2K extra for maxima.  This put the price of the two cars within hundreds of dollars.  Opted for the MKZ and decided to give Ford (1st time ford buyer) a chance.  No regrets yet.  MKZ is very good value for mid size luxury car.

My only gripe is the quality of the interior, especially as pertains to the seat housing on the outside where seat controls reside.  They break away from the seat.  It's a Lincoln design flaw.  My son's MKS did the same thing.  Also, if you're tall, it is difficult to get in and out of the car due to how low to the ground it is (especially if you wear heels).

Currently I have 500 miles on the MKZ, and it's the best car I've ever driven, hands down.  Far beyond a CTS, in my opinion, in ride, quietness, and handling, let alone features.

Have averaged 19.7 mpg with a 50% combination of Highway and around town driving. The interior leather and Dash have been upgraded and now feel like a car in the entry level Luxury Line. Engine is very responsive but there is some difficulty starting without a jerk. Seats are very comfortable and the leather is so much nicer then before. Ride is nt as soft as a Lexus but not bad. Some buttons are hard to reach and they are not placed conveniently. They all feel the same to touch. Engine is quiet. Rode noise is more then expected."

The THX sound blows you away.  The MKZ handles well, the build quality is as good as a Lexus.  I traded in my Lexus SC430 on the MKZ because I needed a sedan, so a Lexus IS and GS was my first test drive.  Both were great, but were lacking in trunk space/storage space.  I loved the Acura TL, but it didn't fit in my small garage, and the Caddy CTS and BMW 528ix didn't have a rear camera and were pricey.  Now that I own my MKZ, I know I selected the right car.  Lincoln has definitely turned the corner on quality and is equal or better that its competitors."

AWD with trac control is as sure footed as a cat. The car is fast, with an incredible ride and is very quiet. Has autostick, bluetooth, Microsoft sync, BLIS, etc. Ultimate package affords every luxury option available on a beautiful car.

New York had 2 major blizzards so far and the Front wheel drive was more then enough to get me to work on time. It's  roomy inside.I always Bought big flag ship GM models and never the smaller model.I looked at the 2010 La Crosse which I think is very Nice along with the CTS but I found that the Lincoln MKZ felt less confining. if You like USA cars the MKZ is a great choice."

As for drive quality, I have test-drove an A4, TL, C300, and 328i as well as previously owned a Cadillac CTS. They all had their quirks and pros and cons. This car stands up to all of them. It may not be the best of the best, but the value in the package is unbeatable."

So far everything has been great and reliable which I don't expect to change since they receive very high marks on reliability. The V6 is smooth and has great power.

I love the memory seats and they work perfect for both sets of keys.  The thing I like the most about the car is the ride.  It does not have a stiff suspension but you can hardly feel bumpy roads.

The car was in great condition and has continued to be a problem free vehicle, which is such a pleasure. I have only replaced the battery and changed the oil regularly. Everything works as it should. The only nitpick I would have is that the MPG isn't that great around town, which is much of my driving and averages about 19 or a little better.
Edit: The car is nearly seven years old, almost 86K, and I have recently done rear brakes and the battery was replaced a few years ago as noted above. That’s it in five year of ownership. It still works great and has been a pleasure to own with almost no maintenance.

I got a great deal on a 2011 Lincoln MKZ AWD and during those snow-filled roads in NY, that AWD was great! In fact, it was impressive and I didn't really think that much about it when I got the AWD vehicle. It drove through deep snow like an all terrain vehicle. The car is really solid. 

Comfortable on long drives. Clean interior design. DVD player. Navigation. Too much to mention. I just want to thank Lincoln for making a car for my taste: young."

Very nice riding, ultra smooth transmission, upscale interior which I wouldn't call luxury, just upscale, very nice stereo system, very pleasant to drive, I find myself looking forward to driving this car and I would recommend it.  I got it on the Lincoln sign & drive.  $0 down, $399/month plus sales tax made the payment $428.  You also get 4 years of free maintenance.  Great deal and a very quiet riding car, it's as quiet as my mother's lexus ES 330."
lincoln,mkz,2011,powertrainman, 05/19/2011,Competition to the Germans,4,"Got delivery of my AWD, 2011 MKZ with 102 executive package.
Took my German boss who has a BMW 550i fully loaded for a ride.
He couldn't believe it.
Germans, and specially my boss are honest in their comments and are not used to giving compliments. He was surprised to say the least. In a nutshell the car is absolutely responsive, a mix between the spark of a BMW and the handling of AWD Audi.
My boss compared it to a Mercedes E class for the ride and comfort. The good news is what you get for the money.
I cannot tell anything about reliability as the car is brand new, but I am happy with the choice I made."
lincoln,mkz,2011,sussexman, 06/06/2011,Luxury Sports Car,4,"I have had my MKZ for 6 months now and overall it is a great car. I was looking for a comfortable car that kept me connected to the road and the MKZ did that better then CTS, BMW or Mercedes for the dollar. If you spend allot of time in the car as I do 8500 miles already and you are 6'4"" this is a great vehicle. I am getting 21 MPG. The car is also very quiet. Navigation is also accurate and speech access makes it easy to use wile driving. Plenty of power both off the start and passing however transmission gets rough when you get on it. Trans is smooth during normal driving. You have to pull out the headlight switch to turn on driving lights this is poor placement as your knee turns it off."
lincoln,mkz,2011,johnnyshea3, 08/13/2011,More than satisfied,4,"I have almost nothing but good things to say about this car. Base model comes very well equipped with virtually everything you would hope to have in a entry level premium sedan. As a technology junkie, the Microsoft-powered Sync interface (standard), is absolutely top shelf. The ride is quiet and supple, with the V6 supplying plenty of power as well as fuel economy. Handling is a tad underwhelming, but that is really my only beef. The cabin is well laid out, and both fit and finish and interior materials are very good.
I find the seats to be very comfortable, and rear legroom is satisfactory. Even without A or Z plan, my sign and drive lease payment was under $400 a month. Recommended! "
lincoln,mkz,2011,B Noble, 11/21/2010,Can't use chains or cables for snow,4,"This car is great to drive - except you cannot use cables or chains under snow conditions over passes in Sierras.

Otherwise, gas economy is about 40 mpg on freeway and 39 in town.  Seats comfortable. Dual climate controls outstanding."

The radio is rediculous and the wind and road noise is awful.
The sloppy shifting transmission newer knows what gear it wants. The memory seats have a short memory. I sure don't see any value or luxury in this MKZ."

Some road noise but the OE tires are not the quietest in the world. Front seats from hell. Probably OK for fat, obese people but anyone lesser needs a pillow for sit comfort
if going over 50 mies.
The remote trunk opening switch is perfectly located to bump with your knee when the driver enters at least 3 our of four times.
Rear head restraints block out part of rear view vision.

SYNC by Microsoft (the best blue tooth, song, traffic and turn-by-turn Navigation device I've ever used). Was only $10.00 more a month than a fully loaded Camry!

Have averaged 39.1 long term combination city/hwy. This car has exceeded our expectations for mileage,comfort,handling and looks. We never expected to own a Lincoln let
alone a hybrid. This car is a well kept secret!"
lincoln,mkz,2012,dieselfest, 09/03/2012,New to Hybrid Cars,3,"Just passed 600 miles on new Ultimate Pkg MKZ Hybrid.
On short trips about 2 miles I get about 26 mpg.
Commute to work 22 miles one way 30City/70Hyw, I get 42 mpg consistently.
Strange results considering city should be 41 mpg and thats what the short trips are.

If I drive normally meaning faster off the line at stop lights and break later and harder, I can only get about 33 mpg average.
This isn't too bad and I can live with those numbers.

The car really teaches me how to drive more efficiently.
I do go past 65 mph but under 75 on the highway regularly and still get 42 mpg.
I find that hard acceleration and hard breaking is my biggest problem."

Crystal White exterior,  light cashmere interior, nice interior wood features... ample trunk room, moon roof seldom use ... leather could be more durable... why black carpet ... should have been cashmere color.  Purchased July 2015 --- one owner, spotless, looks new ... Bad mileage with AC on.  Climate control & AC works great. Love backup camera... Received all manuals with some warranty remaining. Manual describes a replaceable interior air filter to mitigate dust, which I need to figure out.

Was seeking a luxury car and refused to drop $45K as I drive only 7,000 miles per year, so this was a perfect pick!  Considered the Cadillac CTS,  but was a bit turned off for a few reasons and my mechanic advised to steer away- too many issues. He worked on MKZ's  over the years and gives high marks for reliability and no major issues.  

Newer MKZ's 2013/14 are gaudy with back spoiler, takes away class appeal and interior looked cheap with no crafted wood moldings.

Receive many compliments on mine and it's a smooth drive, nice smooth pull.  Very happy!

Our average fuel economy is 37.8 MPG and could be better, depending on how much you're pushed in traffic.
You do not have to trade off on power, it just comes from another source.
It's quiet and responsive; regenerative breaks are great, nice wood trim, more if you get the exec pkg (plus suede inserts); heated and cooled seats; blind spot system is also very helpful.
Headroom is not as spacious because of the moonroof.
Center console hits the arm just right, the ones on the door are too low, so you rest your arm on the window sill.
Decent turning radius, adjustable LED dash display.
THX sound is very nice."
lincoln,mkz,2012,Steve, 01/17/2016,Best Used Value On the Market,4,"I bought the car six months ago with 30,000 miles on it,  still under warranty.  I had a new, long commute and wanted something comfy that wouldn't use a ton of fuel.  It was obviously very well cared for, and equipped with every available option, including the dealer added remote start.  
The ride is quiet, and very solid, not as luxurious as the MKS I had a few years ago, but very nice for its size.  BTW-this is not a big car.  I drove the 2016 MKZ as a loaner car and is noticeably larger.
I changed out the original Michelins for Continentals due to a road hazard problem; the Conti's have been great.  
It's enjoyable to drive, but if you get aggressive on a curve you're reminded that this car was built for cruising.  Not a problem, just a characteristic.
Couple  annoyances : the driver's seat has required constant adjustment trying to find a comfortable seating position, but I've finally found it.  Headroom is at a premium due to the sunroof.  
That's about it for limitations.  It runs smooth as can be, looks good and delivers outstanding mileage.  SYNC is just fine when you learn to use it.; I had an MB and the COMAND system wasn't better, just different.  
While I wouldn't have bought this new at $40++, as a used car this was a great choice.
Update after 18 months: : headroom issue didn't change  Otherwise this has been a great car. Over 41 mpg in warm weather, minus 10% in winter.

lincoln,mkz,2012,jbradsh1, 06/28/2011,2011 Lincoln MKZ,4,"I test drove the Ford Fusion and the Mercury Milan and then drove the MKZ.
What a difference!
The Lincoln has a larger 3.5 L V-6 so it has more power.
It is VERY QUIET unlike the Ford and Mercury.
It's steering is perfectly smooth and doesn't want to jump back to straight and level after a turn.
All the controls are Lincoln smooth so it's a real pleasure to drive this car.
I drove the hybrid MKZ but it's ride was much firmer, too firm actually, it was a deal breaker for me.
My MKZ was the base model which is so well equipped I didn't need any other options at all.
The Lincoln dealer gave me $4K off the sticker price so at $31.5K it's a real bargain in my opinion.
I love it."
lincoln,mkz,2012,Michael Lincoln, 09/08/2015,The Perfect Commuter Car,4,"This is a comfortable and reliable car to get you to work each day.   It does not excel at anything and is very predictable.   The exception is the Sync infotainment.   Specifically the Applink function is hit or miss each day.   I can blame my cellphone as it updates itself weekly or monthly, and Sync never updates.  However, it always fixes itself when you disconnect the battery and reconnect.   Other than that,  I recommend you get this model used as it somehow depreciates to a lower amount than the same year Fusion, which it is based on.    Maintain it and keep it clean.   Lastly, use all the money you save with zero repairs and get a nice sports car, motorcycle, or boat you can have fun with on the weekends.

Update 9-11-16:  It is still a great car.  Sync is a dud - at least Bluetooth works.  Can't be bothered with disconnecting battery cable.  Paint and interior holding up perfectly.  Very quiet, very comfortable. Handling not as great as a BMW but did not pay alot for the car.   No repairs - definitely a keeper.

Update 9-12-17:  Still a very good car.  Sync is better since I installed a software update.  Applink still bad, but at least now, Bluetooth connections will display song and artist.  I have replaced the battery and tires.  No problems in snow with Michelin Premier tires and AWD.  Aside from oil changes, that's it.  I would really like a new Dodge Challenger Scat Pack Shaker Hood as a play car - but hard to justify since this car has everything I NEED, just not everything I WANT.

Update 3-13-18:  Trying to justify getting rid of this to get a Kia Stinger, Audi A-4, 2018 MKZ 3.0 Turbo, etc.   I just can't .   This car has everything I need, enough power, great in the snow with AWD,  quiet, comfortable, and I can fit by bike in the trunk with the seats down.   It also has zero problems and  low trade in value.  I guess I will keep it for quite a while.

Update 3-17-20:  Purchased new tires last month as car was riding horrible.  New tires did not fix it.  Exchanged for really smooth tires Pirelli P7 AS Plus II.  Car still vibrates, especially at low speeds.  My mechanic is unsure of problem - blames tires.  Earlier MKZs had driveshaft problems that produced vibrations but appeared to be resolved a year before mine.  I guess next step is to bring to dealer.  Other than that, car is extremely reliable.  No major work other than tires and changed transmission fluid.

Update 9-12-20

70K.  Rebalancing tires improved vibration issues. Got new brakes pads and rotors. Was advised  draft shaft may need to be replaced soon. This a common problem with Ford AWD systems.  Still looks and runs like new.

lincoln,mkz,2012,tuko, 11/18/2015,Still Nice Hybrid,4,"Purchased 2012 MKZ Hybrid with around 30,000 miles off lease. Certified pre-owned with extended Lincoln warranty. Pros: Great gas mileage averaging 40.5mpg since purchase. Will get upwards of 50+mpg strictly city but ""only"" high 30s on the highway. Goes down in winter or with A/C on. Crystal white exterior with beige interior makes this a nice looking car but hard to keep clean.  Ok ride on smooth roads but a little choppy on rough roads but I've been spoiled with my old Town Car. Main advantage over a 2013 or newer MKZ Hybrid is the size of the gas tank. 2012 was last year for a 17.5 gallon tank which means I maybe fill it up once a month. Previously owned a 2013 Fusion Hybrid with only a 13 gallon tank so needed to fill up more often despite similar gas mileage. Cons: Battery does intrude on trunk space. No indicator on dash to tell you if head lights are on which is weird. Nav option, sun-roof and rear camera are nice options. Overall, wife and I like the car. Now about 72,000 miles.  If I need to haul lots of stuff, there's always my Town Car. Would buy another one if they still made them.

lincoln,mkz,2012,mkzrrr, 12/18/2011,Reliable ride,3,"Turned in a leased 2008 base car for a loaded 2012. Wanted a Hybrid but would have to pay almost $100.00/ month more for a base car than a loaded regular gas engine. FMC does not want to sell Hybrids. The 2008 handled much better than the 2012 . Improvements are a quieter ride and much nicer interior. Do not pay extra for the THX sound system. The base stereo in some ways was better in the 2008 model. Millage has averaged around 22 mpg in mixed use, 24 hwy. The 2008 had almost 50,000 trouble free miles and I expect the 2012 to be the same. Expect around $7000.00 discount on a loaded car, little or none on Hybrid."
lincoln,mkz,2012,Leon Frank, 07/17/2015,"Great car, but.....",3,"There's much to love about this car.  The drive train is near flawless and does what you want it to do.  It accelerates, holds 80 if you set the speed control for that, and glides at any speed relatively quietly and very smoothly.  The Synch system was clearly designed by people who knew they'd never have to drive the car and put up with it.  In every case, it defaults to the worst possible option.  Most screens are so user hostile, even with the Owner's Manual in front of you, you won't easily set whatever you want to do.  There are endless buttons and screen prompts to push.  I still can't figure out what happens when you push the phone button on the steering wheel, but it's near useless.  Ditto the navigation system.  I use a stick to the windshield GPS, but to the amazement of every passenger.  The real issue is the climate control system.  It performed flawlessly all winter, then when summer arrived, I discovered that whoever designed the vents is 5'2"" tall and really does not like people.  The vents are stopped at mid level, they cannot be raised to your face or over you.  The same with right left adjustment, very limited travel.  The real amazement is there is no way to throttle down airflow.  Ford should have looked at any other car on the planet to learn how to make vents.  This may sound insignificant, but on a really hot day, you'll be fighting with them non stop to get air where you want it, and failing every time.  Each of my Toyotas, Prius and Solara before that, had outstanding climate control. Car was comfortable in all weather conditions.  That a Lincoln is so uncomfortable in hot weather is a true amazement.  Test drive the car on a 95 degree day before you write out a check for one.

I was little concerned since this particular vehicle wasn't AWD (it's FWD). It did a good job in the snow. Tons of trunk space. I had a vehicle pull in front of me at a 90 degree angle. Emergency braking was rock solid, vehicle tracked straight, no issues. Vehicle has a solid feel when driving. Shutting the doors, you feel like you've put something heavy and solid in place.

The car is an outstanding value as a USED car because of its high depreciation. It delivers in ""spades"" when it comes to providing a serene and VERY quiet ride. Performance is very good with rapid acceleration and precise,flat cornering. Reliability has been outstanding with ZERO problems during the 14mo that I have had the car. The car has a very good interior except for a couple of things: the door storage bins are made of hard plastic and don't match the high quality of the rest of interior; the base audio system leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to sound quality (poor bass). I would also give a shout out to the selling dealer, WHITE BEAR LINCOLN in White Bear Lake, MN. This dealer ""bent over backwards"" to make sure I was totally satisfied with my purchase! KUDOS! Update: It is now Feb 11, 2018. The Lincoln has 62,000miles on odometer. Still no reliability issues of ANY kind.

We were not in the market to trade but our 2007 town car with 86 K broke down on the way to a grandsons wedding.  Only rental available was a ford 250 pickup.  We traded and really like the car.  The thing we do NOT like is repairs.  The AC quit cooling on the passenger side at 50K.  The dealer pulled out the entire dash but could not find the problem, even with factory engineers help.  Finally realized it was low on Freon.  Added Freon and two months later it did the same thing.  Added Freon and two months later it did it again.  FINALLY the dealer found a leak in the condenser and replaced it.  At 59 K the idler pulley on the serpentine belt went bad.  Shortly after that I started to notice a faint rattle under the car.  It got worse over time and I had my mechanic try to find it.  He could not.  It continued to get worse so I took it back today.  He found that the ball joints are bad on both sides...@ 61k miles!

After just under a year of ownership, I’ve had 0 issues. Standard maintenance is very affordable (certainly less than my previous BMW 7-Series (mistake) and Lexus LS), and the fuel savings are amazing... not to mention the hybrid setup provides for a *very* quiet ride. It’s not quite at the level of the LS, but it is quieter than the 7-Series or an Audi A8 (which—in my opinion—felt more performance-focused, however). My previous purchases were mostly in the large luxury car segment, but the switch to the Lincoln MKZ hybrid just felt so right. If you’re in the market for a car that prioritizes performance, this is not for you. If you’re in the market for a car that makes you feel confident, offers a smooth and quiet ride, is a practical choice, and has pretty good driving dynamics, this car is hands down the best on the market.

On March 8 we left on a 4000 mile round trip from Minnesota to Arizona.
When we returned home eleven days later, we had driven on icy Midwest roads, 11,000' mountain passes, desert roads and interstate highways in seven states.

lincoln,mkz,2013,Phil, 03/22/2016,"Good, Bad, And Ugly",4,"The saving grace of my car was i got it """" second handed from the dealer with 495 miles on it thus extending my warranty to 100K miles.  
Lets start with the good: Everyone that got in the car would go gaga over the interior, the lighting, and other various features. My car has every option.  It parks itself but only on the right side, has a ridiculous backup camera, and a panoramic roof that is to die for.  I'm not dying but it's very nice.  The gas mileage is great and i average over 40MPG during the spring and fall and 38ish in the summer and winter when running A/C or heat.  The comfort level is unmatched.  
The bad: Never buy new or else the depreciation will make you cry unless it's an SUV or a Lexus. 3 years ago i paid 38 before taxes and such and now dealers will barely give me 20,000.  Interior moldings came detached on a couple of occasions and my bumper to bumper warranty came in handy every time. My regular battery died within weeks of buying the car and was replaced, there is an under car cover that ripped on two separate occasions and dragged on the road. I had it removed. I'm on my third set of tires but i can't figure whose fault it is.  The hybrid is very light so tire spin happens with ease as the weight over the wheels is drastically reduced. My navigation system reboots randomly and sometimes it takes ten minutes of driving before my route will set.
The Ugly:  Recalls, I've had at least four. If I wasn't under the used car extended warranty my cost of ownership would be way higher than how low it is now.

lincoln,mkz,2013,lanez, 03/23/2013,"Nice, so far",4,"First luxury car I have bought new and I test drove a lot before buying, being a hybrid was my selling point to my wife. Very quiet and comfortable car, could not think about not getting the big sunroof in the MKZ. My son describes the lighting on the car as ""sick"", led headlights better than xenon. Ambient interior lighting puts a soft glow in your choice of eight colors, the entire cabin is lighted. Could not get the 45mph in western Pennsylvania but did get 40 mpg, thinking about traveling to Ohio just to test it. Compare to the CTS and you will not believe what Ford has done.
42k for the Caddy and you can't plug in your iPhone???? MKZ is a champ, so far."
lincoln,mkz,2013,jts14, 05/31/2013,Makes anything else feel boring,4,"Befor my MKZ, I was leasing a 2012 Cadillac CTS. I thought that was a beautiful car, but then I tested an MKZ, and when I got my car back it felt like I was going back in time. This car blows me away with all of its cool tricks. They really paid attention to the small details in this car; from the ambient lighting (which you can change the color), the push-button shift, and the lights above the back seats (touch-sensitive sensors built into the headliner) I feel like a kid in a candy store in this and its only been a few days! I have the base model, with few options and it already blows my Cadillac out of the water. I would highly recomend this to anyone buying a luxury car. Lincolns back!"
lincoln,mkz,2013,dreamless, 06/16/2013,"MKZ Hybrid 2013, review, Edmunds is off the mark",5,"When reading reviews, make sure the person has actually driven the car, and the competition. I test drove this car as well as the Lexus ES 300h, Mercedes C class 300 4 matic, Mercedes E class 350, Audi a6, and the BMW 3 series. Most of the professional reviews seem to be written by [non-permissible content removed].
 
After test driving them all by far the best overall was the Lincoln MKZ (hybrid). It was as comfortable as the Lexus ES350, It has more tech then any in its class or above it (deserves a 5 in that category), The Merc C class looks like a childs toy and feels like one comparitively. And it has the highest gov safety rating, stops sooner then EVERY CAR in its class, also should be 5."

Totally ecstatic over the purchase. Could not be happier with the 2.0 Ecoboost. Perfect balance of power and fuel economy. Avg. 32.8 for the trip. Very nice ride and handling. Lincoln has a winner. Usually don't post reviews, however, felt compelled with this vehicle."

It has everything in it except for the seat massagers, which won't be out for a few more months.

The car is beautiful, comfortable and nicely made. The panoramic roof is really cool, and the electric shade is a neat touch.

I got every major option, but you haven't experienced anything until you let the car parallel park itself. This is an option you might find on more expensive luxury cars. Watching the steering wheel turn itself as you gently work the brake and ease back - and forward - is amazing."
lincoln,mkz,2013,lovetennis2, 05/08/2013,love my mkz hybrid,5,"I just got my new mkz 4 weeks ago and it is a joy to drive. It rides smoothly and so far I am averaging close to 40 mpg and that is only about 400 miles of driving. The THX stereo is very enjoyable and the music is crystal clear. The new technology is a valuable asset. Many times I was warned with my blind spot indicator in the side mirrors that another car was close to my side. One time the lane drift alert gave me a warning that perhaps I should stop and take a rest (wow).
I thought the price is definitely worth the value of this car."
lincoln,mkz,2013,johnnytshea3, 07/28/2013,Impressive Statement from Lincoln,4,"This car is just a joy to drive. I get compliments almost daily on the styling, it's definitely a head-turner. As far as the driving experience, one word of advice; save some $ and go for the 2-liter Ecoboost. My previous '11 MKZ had the 3.7 and I see little difference performance-wise, yet I'm getting 8-10 mpg better mileage. The MyLincolnTouch system is not perfect, but it's not nearly as frustrating as it's made out to be. Fit and finish is good, although one negative is that the steering wheel placement obstructs the gear indicator on the instrument panel. This is a problem if you want to drop it into sport mode. Overall though, I am very satisfied, this car gets an awful lot right."
lincoln,mkz,2013,Keith Paul, 09/07/2015,MKZ hybrid caveat emptor,3,"EPA MPG on sticker when new, was incorrect. Lincoln finally admitted to this error under government order and I got a free pair of sunglasses. I have never gotten more than 35.5 overall average mpg. Sticker originally said 48 mpg. I have had five recalls in two years. Now with less than 30,000 miles I have recently experienced, on two occasions, on 2 occasions, an involuntary transmission shift from drive to reverse when stopped. I have researched this to see if anybody else has had a problem or has noticed this but I have been unable to find this same issue. Scary! Thankfully, I have another vehicle, have stopped driving the Lincoln and will be taking the Lincoln back to the dealer this week.
The drivers side has a terrible blind spot due to structural post size and placement.. On screen LCD touch controls for just about everything from entertainment to climate, can be just a little bit distracting unless you learn the very specific commands for voice control which doesn't always respond to your request. On the positive side, the car is quite roomy for all, front and back. Including this 6 foot owner/primary driver. It looks great and the white pearl paint is very catchy.

I'm like a kid in a candy shop (more like a techie in a computer shop)!
The style is gorgeous, the electronics incredible.
There are so many well-thought-out accessories that you will find after you start using them (many will only be discovered as you get to know the car).

But don't expect 45/45/45 for mileage.
By the car's gauge, I have only gotten 35 - 37 MPG, and that is on both city and a trip (mostly flat; not speeding)."

choosing the Lincoln over the Fusion. The vehicle drive wonderfully and meets all our expectations for luxury.
We do have a couple of minor issue that has to with the placement of the navigation system and use of the my-Lincoln touch system. It is difficult to view the navigation system at times because
of the sun.
The navigation/my-Lincoln touch system console tends to hold fingerprints more than the my-Ford touch system. This should have been thought of with the design, but otherwise this is only thing we have noticed.
The car drives great with 40 mpg."

lincoln,mkz,2013,jimma, 12/17/2014,Wonderful car with great MPG,4,"2013 MKZh , Driving this for a year and half. Was very concerned about buying a Lincoln as I always drove Honda Accords coups (EXL) for last 20 years. I am completely satisfied with this car. I get 39 - 41 mpg , my 4cyl. stick  Accord was getting 30. The car handles better than I thought and has enough power for any road situations , I drive turnpikes and large highways and have no trouble entering on ramps and passing large trucks. At 22,000 miles I still get a kick getting into the car.      My update , now after four years I still feel the same. I have had no problems at all with the car,after 38,000 miles it still runs like new. Now at 42,000 car is running perfect , replaced back brakes change oil every 6 - 7000 miles. At 46,000 the rear shocks had to be replaced ,this was done under warranty.  This is an update 2018 . I liked the car so much I purchased a 2016 MKZh . My ratings will stay the same also .

A similar one came to another dealer and my dealer got it for me.
So far it is absolutely beautiful, I have gone over it with the proverbial
fine tooth comb and can find no flaws.
The Crystal Champaign paint is flawless. They really did their homework on this car.
With the short time I have had it the mileage shows around 40.1 mpg. I am really impressed with the quietness of the vehicle and the smoothness of the transition from electric to gas.
With the car arriving so late I thought of cancelling and waiting for the 2014 but, I am glad I finally got one.

Never in my life did I ever think I would be interested in a Lincoln until I saw the 2013 MKZ at the 2012 Auto show.
As soon as I saw it I said to myself, ""That will be my next car.""
Now I have it and I LOVE it.
This review may not mean much to those much older than I am and have had plenty more cars to base their opinions on other than myself.
I get that, I really do.
But this is a phenomenal car.
I am in the military and drive on base(s) every day.
Military folks tend to ""pay attention,"" even the car one drives.
In one day I was asked about my car about 20 times, including friends and strangers.

lincoln,mkz,2013,mcroad, 04/06/2013,Awesome,5,"We just received our MKZ hybrid this week after waiting 5 long months and believe me it was worth the wait.
My husband was worried about being comfortable in this car because he is a big guy.
He love it and fits in it just fine, cannot say anything negative about this purchase.
We have not broken it in yet to get the 45mpg as said but the manual said 1000 miles to be broken in.
If we do get the 45mpg then it is that much more pleasing. Love the color we got the smoked quartz and it is similar to yankee blue. Lincoln has really worked wonderfully to make us happy with the purchase and incentives for waiting. Thank you Lincoln."

First of all it is BEAUTIFUL inside and out, it drives like a dream and I love the ""VALUE"" I got from this car. I looked at the BMW 528 and MB E300H and they start at 50k+ and don't have some of the great stuff I has. I got 46mpg from two fill-ups, but I drive mostly on electric and in traffic and take my time! if you drive slowly and give yourself lots of stop distance you can get 45+mpg. Love the LED lights inside and out and the AC front ""seats"" and the adaptive cruise / LED headhlights / ride controls. The voice control system is awesome,it can control almost anything (calls, Nav, Temp and Radio / Sat). "
lincoln,mkz,2013,teechee, 05/27/2013,MKZ update,5,"Took the car on the road for a weekend trip.
It handled flawlessly.
Quiet, nimble, quick and smooth.
I discovered that the car also has a lane keeping system that tightens the steering wheel should you drift out of your lane.
The car has just over a thousand miles and the gas mileage is quite impressive.
I have the 4 cylinder AWD.
Can't wait to try it in the snow."
lincoln,mkz,2013,zbrid2013, 08/03/2013,MKZ Software Update Completed,5,"Bought my new 13 Z four months ago and it's great to drive, comfortable and quiet. I have the hybrid and it offers a smoother ride than the EcoBoost version. My MPG was under 37 MPG and I just had the update done at AutoNation in Clearwater on Friday and I'm now averaging 42 MPG:-) 

In addition, they fixed a recall item on the fuel pump (something like that) and I've got to admit that the car rides different (better all the way around) and it's pretty cool to be pushing 80 MPH and be on electric:-) Maybe it took Lincoln a bit more time to get it right, but they did."
lincoln,mkz,2013,pacman2044, 09/12/2013,Buyers Remorse,3,"So I needed a new business car before my trip to Asia and I didn't do a lot of research or comparison shopping. I had heard that Ford had improved their vehicles and so i bit the MKZ because I loved the way it looked. What a mistake. I purchased the FWD with the 2.0 engine and 19'' wheels.
The front wheel drive is not smooth and luxurious. You can feel every bump in the road. When you press hard on the gas you hear the engine make high pitched sounds.
Already had the ""check adaptive headlights"" and less than 3k miles. The turn single control is flimsy and already broke. Now granted the loaner MKZ they gave me was loaded with AWD and the 2.0 engine..
much better ride then the FWD"
lincoln,mkz,2013,ajayla, 04/05/2015,"Great Balance of Style, Substance, and Economy",5,"I bought this car certified when it came off lease. There was simply no other models offering the combination this one did. I considered Fusion hybrids, which are obviously similar, but found no price difference.

The ""lifetime"" fuel use over 20,000 miles is just under 39 mpg. Considering the level of luxury, this is pretty great. Coupled with a solid ride, responsive handling, and all the systems it provides, the Lincoln makes a compelling case.

The changes between hybrid and engine modes are very subtle. The start-stop system on even BMWs is rough in comparison. Power is not a high point, but it's there when needed. 

UPDATE

Two years later, the car is still going strong. I've had a few minor issues -- automatic lights (finally fixed on third attempt) and juddering panoramic sunroof operation when baking in the sun (still not resolved after four attempts). While the dealer has been excellent in providing loaner cars, thus minimizing inconvenience to me, I see a tendency to update software rather than look deeper. (For example, the automatic lights needed a new sensor.)

I remain very impressed by the technology, though the learning curve was pretty steep. 

The main disappointment, which I knew going in, has to do with the power output of the engine, the tendency for the CVT to drone when accelerating hard, and the general harshness, vibration, and sound of the gas engine. These are imperceptible when driving moderately, but definitely detract from the smoothness of the driving experience when, for example, accelerating on a grade. 

But these are the traits of a hybrid. I continue to average between 37 and 38 MPG in hilly urban terrain. That's more than twice the efficiency of my prior car, which had nowhere near the level of sophistication and was smaller and lighter. While I don't drive a lot, I feel good to be doing my part, and doing it discretely.  Yes, there is a slight lack of polish in the drive train, but it's not significant in the overall picture.

As for value, I took advantage of heavy depreciation when I bought the car as it was coming off lease. I imagine that the depreciation has continued, though at a slower pace. I appreciate that the car design did not change in any significant way in four years. Now the front is different, but the rest of the car is the same, so it still looks current., Would I buy this car again? If it were 2015 again, yes. In the past two years, though, there have been major technological advances and a broadening of options, so I might give consideration to other cars.

lincoln,mkz,2013,muncie_in, 10/12/2013,"Very Good, but not Great",4,"Purchased this car 4 weeks ago. On a 4-hour highway trip averaged 38 mpg. Same in town. Car is very comfortable to sit in for long distances. Interior is classy and exterior paint looks great.

Complaints include fuel efficiency leaves display difficult to determine how efficient you are at that moment. Windows look great, but difficult to see oncoming traffic when backing up on a slight curve. 

Most disappointment was/is with Lincoln itself. They offered a $1000.00 rebate if your car was from a competing manufacturer, but not if you were a loyal Ford owner! I've never been penalized for loyalty."

I looked at all hybrids in its class and Lincoln had the quietest ride among all. Lincoln invested in what's not available in other 40K range cars: improved sound insulation and, consequently, reduced wind noise. Looking at its' expensive looking elegant exterior, it's hard to guess that it's most practical and versatile hybrid in a class, due to its folded seats capacity.

lincoln,mkz,2013,Joe T, 02/06/2020,"Quiet, smooth, and efficient",4,"This is not an exciting car. In fact, probably don't buy a Lincoln if you want an exciting car (and definitely don't get a CVT). I have my e39 manual for that. However, what Lincoln does very well is make quiet, smooth vehicles that are excellent and luxurious daily drivers. This car is also great for long cross country trips thanks to incredibly comfortable seats and convenient charging ports for devices. Trunk space is good for long and narrow items but on the smaller side for boxier shapes. Just keep up with preventative maintenance and this car will last. I'm over 100k miles and it's still smooth and efficient. I like the design before they changed the front end so this year is nice and these cars can be found relatively cheap.

lincoln,mkz,2013,Claudio, 03/16/2017,Remember the 2004 Cadillac SRX?,1,"In all fairness I bought this car around Feb 15 2017 with 40000 miles. The car had the larger engine and AWD. I took it back to the shop twice in one month. When the car hit 50 mph it shook and vibrated. All four tires needed balanced not aligned balanced. The wipers were really bad and needed replaced. The volume on the best stereo system they offer would not work from time to time. When the ac was activated I would hear a noise that resonated into the car. Very annoying. I owned the car for a little over a month. The Certified 160 point check is a joke. Lincoln wanted me to pay for the balancing of the wheels and replacing the wipers. My argument was by me paying for the service it goes against the 160 point check. If they took it for a ride they would have noticed the shaking of the car at 50 mph. Just a bunch of check marks. This car was a Lincoln Certified Vehicle.  I traded it in just one month later and bought a Toyota Camry. The Camry road so much better. I bought a lemon and took a beating on the trade and the deposit I put down on the Lincoln. Now I feel safe and not worried about taking my car into the shop more than necessary.

Why would you drive some little electric or hybrid car when you can drive one of these and get 40mpg.
Car now has 63k on and will need new rear brake pads. Will replace rotors at the same time with new original equipment because they are are rusty from low usage with Hybrid braking. OE is still probably best for anti rust long term.

lincoln,mkz,2014,bhp2000, 12/30/2013,4TH MKZ OWNED (Have 3.7 model),4,"Through 30 yrs had 5 BMWs, 2 Benz, 2 Jags & an Audi.
ALL tire eaters.
ALL ugly brake dust a wk after wash.
All Premium gas.
Most had me in the SERVICE depts on a reg. basis.
BMW the worst. (Over-tech-ed)

Got tired of it all in '07 & tried an MKZ.

Cheaper to buy of course and luxury perks suffered but was pissed off.


Then, things like REGULAR gas, no brake dust, tires getting 46k miles rather than 20k, free oil changes, rotations etc and NO PROBLEMS mechanically inspired the next one & so on.

The car keeps improving & current one's the best so far.
DON'T believe reviewers trashing after a day with the car. ASK OWNERS you see on the street then test drive.
SUPPORT USA!"
lincoln,mkz,2014,xeroblu, 05/01/2014,Great milage,4,"Ive had some premium cars in my life and I've never received so many complements on this ride by all age groups. In its reserve trim with the upgraded wheels and roof it looks slick. The car was a first year production run and if you recall Lincoln had production problems with the MKZ meeting quality standards holding up release several months. Its said Maulally then CEO of Ford was ready to scrap the brand because of it. I say this because the car has interior issues. Ive had several panels fall off, and squeaks and rattles have been a chore for me and my Lincoln dealership to iron out. That said, Ive driven the new ones and I'm confident all those issues have been resolved so buying a new Lincoln is a safe choice and a wise one if you like the look. In fact the new hybrids have been re worked and tuned to use more EV than my 2014 resulting in a quieter more buttoned up ride.  Huge strides have been made in the material quality from my 2014 to the current 2016's in leather and interior panels. All that said I'm planning on leasing a new continental when this lease is up. Lincoln has won me over in their customer service. Beats BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Lexus hands down. Lincoln picks up the car for service leaving me with a Lincoln loaner returning my car where ever I am. Essentially you never have to see the dealership for service and if you buy Black Label you just never need to go to the dealer even to purchase. No one else does this and it does make a difference.

lincoln,mkz,2014,driver130, 03/29/2014,Glad I got it,5,"I almost brought a Cadillac until I saw that Lincoln Hybrid was the same price as the non Hyb.
I have this car three months and it is comfortable, fun to drive looks good too. The electronics are not at all confusing as some pro reviewers have suggested, nor does it make noise when converting to gas from battery. Study the manual a bit and the electronics will become intuitive.
The extra space provided by push button gears and no shift handle is awesome. I have compared this to friends' BMW and Benz and the Lincoln actually has some better features. The audio system being one. THX audio rocks. Crisp and clear sound."
lincoln,mkz,2014,randygrenier, 11/21/2013,Luxury Sedan for Grownups,4,"I previously owned a Cadillac CTS, but I like the MKZ Hybrid much more.
I'm glad someone finally recognizes there is a market for this kind of car.
I respect that others want high-performance road racing cars, but I prefer a quiet, posh ride.

The technology is unbelievable.
The reviewers mention the computerized continually adjusting dampening system, but they don't mention that it ""learns"" along with brakes, acceleration, you driving habits, and road conditions to improve over time.
The cabin tech is out of this world--not enough space here to even begin."
lincoln,mkz,2014,warpaint1, 12/19/2013,MKZ Hybrid,4,I love the exterior styling on the MKZ and the lines of the vehicle are beautful. I love the look and feel of the handling. The fit and finish is amazing and the sound quility is the best. The ride is what I expected it to be excellent. Sure there are more expensive vehicles out there but I think Lincoln has come a long way with the design and build of the new MKZ. 
lincoln,mkz,2014,chicagoeg, 04/14/2014,Love My MKZ Hybrid,4,"Previous 3 new cars have been Acura TL's. Loved them but wanted better mileage and to get away from premium gas. I've owned the MKZ for 6 months and put 7,500 Chicago miles on it. Seems winter mileage (mixed city and hiway) 38 to 40. Now, April, running about 42 MPG, Very satisfied with that , but may get even better during summer. Love the lines and ride. Tech controls a bit too sensitive and complex. So far, VERY satisfied. "
lincoln,mkz,2014,Fred, 06/16/2016,Third Ford Corporation Hybrid,5,"This is my third ""Ford Corporation"" hybrid.  First was a 2010 Ford Fusion (great vehicle), Second, a 2012 Lincoln MKZ (another great vehicle) and this one, a 2014 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.  I purchased the 2014 Lincoln solely because it has ""killer"" looks, very eye-catching and the newest battery technology.  I've had no problems with ANY of the hybrids and the gas mileage is fantastic.  I really like Ford's hybrids because they look like ""real"" cars, not like ""insects"" as in the Toyota Prius.  There's only a couple of things I would change, one is the CVT transmission (I don't care for the ""drone"" sound it makes under hard acceleration {although it does perform well at all highway speeds}), the second is a larger fuel tank and the third is the many touch screen prompts (I prefer buttons/switches and knobs).   Dealer service is great, showrooms are high class and personnel are very friendly.  Additionally, Lincoln does not charge extra for the hybrid edition.  A nice feature is when sitting in traffic, the battery pack heats and cools the interior of the car without running the engine and only comes on temporarily when the battery pack needs to be recharged and that only takes a few minutes.  Can't buy a better vehicle.  One other issue I'm concerned about is the premature wear of the Michelin tires, although the tires are not a Lincoln issue, these tires do not wear as well as other Michelin tires I've had.  The tires are rotated and balanced every 5 thousand  miles.  I purchased a set of Vogue tires and although they are not ""easy rollers"", they perform much better than the Michelins.  I have noticed a slight reduction in gas mileage (MPG) with these tires however, the extended miles of wear and road-feel is a good trade-off."

lincoln,mkz,2014,alfista79, 04/20/2014,"Smiles per Miles, and going strong",4,"I actually have the V6 AWD, but I cannot select it in the options list. Love the exterior design, I am just smitten by its sinister beauty, especially in SmokedQuartz. The V6 is rev-happy, albeit not as torquey as GM's; the suspension is tight, and the electronic steering is not numb, nor too heavy. In AWD form with Pirelli's summer rubber, the car feels glued to the road on sharp, fast turns. Acceleration is brisk enough, but remember, this is NOT meant to be a Mustang for Lincoln; rather, a luxurious performance cruiser, and it fits the bill nicely. Interior is plush, supportive, and it gets plenty of praises, especially the novel arch! Touch-controls are not bad at all, as some mags say."
lincoln,mkz,2014,Russ, 07/16/2016,2014 Mkz with 5k driven miles,5,"First off I got really lucky with finding a MKZ with everything  I wanted with only 5000 miles on it.   The other MKZs had over 20k on them.  so far I've had the car for 3 weeks and it's been nothing but a dream it's almost brand new the ride is super comfortable I came out of a Cadillac CTS and before that I had a Mercedes Benz 350 so I know what Comfort feels like in this MKZ is perfect when it comes to comfort and styling the interior is super quiet the  exterior is strikingly beautiful. I love the I4 ecoboost engine gives you the power when you need it I feel like I'm still in my V6 and when you go into sport mode it is really phenomenal on how it handles the technology package is not for everybody but I love it some of the older people don't like it they want knots and you'll see the 2017 MKZ they went back to knobs but I prefer the Sleek styling that they have an in MKZ.  You will not go wrong with a MKZ.  Lincoln did a great job in this car..

lincoln,mkz,2014,obee, 07/07/2014,Happy purchaser,5,"We traded our A6 Audi for the MKZ hybrid and couldn't be happier. We took delivery in Arizona and after about 300 miles drove it to Minnesota. We find the seating more comfortable than the Audi but we did get the messaging seats because of my wife's back trouble.
We averaged 40.2 on the trip and now at 3000 miles it is at 41.
We have had two shorter trip gas fills with one at 48 and one at 44, but I have to say that we live in a rural area with a lot of 55 mph roads and we have paid close attention to acceleration and braking. I appreciate the lack of a shifter since they only connect to wires anyway.
The interior is very attractive and close to the Audi's quality.

lincoln,mkz,2014,Varun, 02/18/2016,Not your grandpas car anymore,5,"No place to review the TV ads? ;)

Must say as a 33 year old and looking for a car that is reliable, sleek, feature rich, sporty yet sophisticated - I didn't think an American car stood a chance.

Then Lincoln redesigned the MKZ in 2013 and boy did they do an amazing job! It turned my head whenever I saw one on the road... And I'm glad to say the features match the top notch style.

I have the '14 MKZ 3.7 v6 FWD. Also has the Tech Package, 19"" wheels and THX sound. My highlights:

- Exterior look is bold yet sophisticated
- interior is exquisite. The touch screens and knob/buttonless center console is awesome!
- Noise cancelling technology makes the cabin super quiet
- push button transmission! Uh, super cool!
- Techology package is a must for adaptive cruise control (read about it), parallel park assist, Lane departure warning & more
- the THX sound is incredible! 14 speakers worth of audio bliss
- The car handles like a dream, even in snowey conditions and the sports mode is fun for when you want more muscle than fuel economy
- every feature you want is included: memory seats, a remote start that works from inside a building, dimming &
Heated mirrors, power open/close on trunk, voice control your phone (Siri) plus the car, heated & cooled seats... All of them! Plus heated steering wheel.

This car is amazing. Give it a try, it's hands down better than all its competitors in overall value, features and perdormance.

lincoln,mkz,2014,danstr1, 12/05/2014,I feel the need to write a review,4,"I recently purchased a new MKZ. I feel compelled to write a review after reading several negative reviews written by ""professional"" reviewers. Please sit down...I'm in my late 30's and traded in a relatively new Audi on the thing. Technology is truly important to some of us along with handling and a nice compliant ride. This has all the above. My Audis handled well but had none of these other qualities. Reliability is also key. I'm truly pleased with my purchase and feel that the styling is anything but cookie cutter and offers a great combination of features. Rebadged Ford.. so is Lexus....so is Acura....so is Audi.... so what!"
lincoln,mkz,2014,cb2015, 12/22/2014,Love this car,5,"I've been driving a Lincoln MKZ 214, 6 cylinder, AWD since January and absolutely love it. I spent at least 8 months researching and test driving different cars. The Cadillac CTS had such a small interior and such a high price tag, as did the BMW 5, and the Audi 5. Plus their interiors were boring. I saw the MKZ in person and knew that was the car for me. I don't know why Edmunds gives it a C rating. I previously owned a MB C350 and an Infinity MX37 and they don't even come close to the MKZ as far as tech and overall comfort. I should've had the dealer include the module that allows me auto start the car with my iPhone...."
lincoln,mkz,2014,TrevorP, 07/01/2016,2014 Lincoln MKZ 3.7L AWD,4,"This is my second winter owning the car. Last winter I had few issues with the power decklid not opening and closing automatically. It would still pop the trunk but my auto closing switches didn't work so i had to open and close it manually. No big deal. This winter, it wont even pop the trunk. I am locked out of the trunk of my vehicle unless I fold down the back seats and pull the emergency release. Then I had a dead battery....Once I got the vehicle started, it displayed several warnings (Service TPS, hill start not available, Service steering system) but the car was running. I realized i had a problem when I was unable to turn the steering wheel. If you live in cold climates, this is a terrible car. Everything is electric. Other than this issue, its a great car to spend time in and drive. I absolutely love it during the summer when everything works. *UPDATE* after taking the vehicle in to figure out the problem, they told me the trunk module was the cause of the draining battery. $400 to fix. After that was fixed the car hasn't had any other issues. 
*update 06/27/18* 
Car is still running great! Keep up on regular maintenance and it runs and drives great. I do think I need to get new brakes soon but no major issues this far other than the trunk module and battery issues I had last year.

Lincoln did a fantastic job with this car.
I have had my new car now for about three months, and have absolutely no complaints.
My hybrid is fully loaded...the only thing it does not do is tell me hello when I get in...which would be pretty cool :)

lincoln,mkz,2014,Chuck in Daytona Beach, 06/29/2019,Superb ride & FABULOUS fuel economy in luxury car-,5,"I purchased this Lincoln MKZ hybrid as my primary business vehicle and LOVE. LOVE, LOVE  this car!  Its a very comfortable ride, which is important to me as I frequently make trips of 500 mile+ per day in my work.  Feel comfortable and relaxed starting out and getting back.  The fuel mileage is fantastic and encourage you to make long trips without worrying about huge fuel bill.  Trips to the local grocery store often yield 70 mpg!  Amazing!!  Highway is typically around 38 - 40 mpg.  The only thing that's not perfect is the roof height on entry, and that is because my car has the full panoramic roof that opens up all the way back to the rear passenger seat. The roofline is dropped to accommodate the retractable roof.   A lot of fun to drive with roof open, feels like a convertible.  Just have to ""ease into"" driver seat paying attention to the lower roof line.  A really fabulous car, though, in every other regard. 

This vehicle is even better at 145,000 miles than when purchased.  It rides extremely well, fuel economy has hung in around 38.5 mpg average, and comfort is super.  Typical local trips have been running 47-53 mpg which to me is amazing.  Changed out tires from original Michelins, seems to not have affected fuel economy or ride.  We often use this vehicle for travel between our homes, about 1,000 miles each way.  Always arrive fresh and relaxed.  LOVE this vehicle!

Yesterday, a good friend of mine saw this car for the first time and he was in awe with that car. With that note, he was about to get off from the front passenger seat. Since the car has a lower seating and the door was far from him to hold on to, he held on to the top frame of the car with his right hand fingers over the roof that I had just opened to display. With rain coming, I decided to close it with his fingers still on. The glass roof rolled over his fingers just as tight as one can imagine. His 3 fingers are now fractured. Owners of the car with this roof, please be aware that this could happen to you or someone with you. "

I have been dying to come back to American cars and this was to have been the triumphant return for me.
While I was wowed by the exterior design, it stops for me there.
I am 6ft tall and mid fifties.
I think the new average buyer's age.
I bump my head every time I get in the car (roof too short).
Lumbar support is poor, quality of the leather interior is not plush and comfortable (what I consider luxury is a plush interior) and I have never once gotten 40 mpg much less higher.
I do not drive over 70 on the highway and am definitely not a speeder."
lincoln,mkz,2014,tarheel6521, 03/01/2015,Excellent Car - with a few irritations **UPDATED**,4,"I had the itch to trade and had researched the MKZ, E350 and BMW 5-Series in the previous weeks.
My irritations are with build quality - which I blame on Ford shipping their luxury car brand assembly to Mexico. 
As this was the most expensive car I've ever bought or leased, I expect ZERO defects. My MB and 2012 Taurus were perfect during my entire ownership experience. I expect the same from what was America's luxury car leader for so many years. remains they are left to clean up the issues caused by mother Ford/Lincoln by farming assembly to Mexico to save costs, but still charge a big price for their vehicles. 
*****************
Update after 3 years of ownership:
Quality of the interior controls - cheap plastic.  Push button transmission selector is cheap plastic. The ""ok"" buttons on the steering wheel are the worst. Contacts require you press firmly to engage the contacts underneath. 
Seats: Comfortable on long trips but they do wear you down after 400 miles.
MPG:  On interstate at 75 mph I average 32-33 mpg. Around town between 23-25.  
Engine: Built in Spain. The 2.0L EcoBoost has some nads! 
Value:  For what you pay, it's not worth the price. You can pick up a 1-2 year old E350 or 5 Series CPO for the price paid new for the MKZ.  Maybe the redesign of 2017 has taken care of the ""cheapness"" of the interior finish. 
I've ordered a new F150 King Ranch. I'm spoiled but the F150 is built in the USA by American workers. Get smart Lincoln/Ford and bring MKZ/Fusion production back to American soil.

The car has a sleek aerodynamic design that can create a bit of a challenge for a larger person getting in and out of the car... definately something to consider.  The interior of the car overall is very nice. Not a ton of compartment space but enough for daily use. The quality and workmanship is exceptional. Definitely what I've come to expect from Lincoln. It comes with plenty of bells, whistles and technology to peak your interest for the long haul. It's good on gas and performs well when you need to hop out in traffic quickly. The interior lights on the doors, ceiling, floor and exterior light on the rear add another level of wow to the car. Its a nice cross between sport and luxury if your someone that likes a lilttle of both. Definately an eye catcher that won't dissapoint when they see you coming.

lincoln,mkz,2014,sherrybgray, 03/29/2017,Second and Last Lincoln,3,"After 20 years of driving a Buick, in 2012 my husband and I bought a 2012 used MKZ with 18,000 miles. We purposely looked at Ford and Lincoln because they did not take the bail out money; and because my old Buick was the best riding car I ever owned. Two weeks ago we traded that car in on a 2014 MKZ with 22,000 miles on it. There are a lot of things I like about the 2014 over the 2012... It's much sportier looking, accessing the climate, phone, and media is much easier. Gas mileage is about the same on both cars. But that's all the good stuff I have to say.  It rides like a wagon. Honestly I can't believe it has the Lincoln name on it. When I test drove the car it had General tires on it. The dealership offered to put new Michelin's on the car, but only after I made the purchase. While I didn't love the look of my 2012 Lincoln, but I sure liked how it rode. In the settings I have changed the setting from sport to comfort and I don't think it made any difference. One problem is probably the low profile tires, but I am not a fan. Two weeks in, and we are thinking about trading it. But never will I purchase another Lincoln.

I think the exterior is one of the best designs of that year. It was just so unique and elegant that I knew I had to have this auto first I saw it at the ford dealership. The car I owned was certified pre owned but flawless outside and inside. But there were few annoying problems I have to mention.  Dashboard rattle. I had it on fusion with which mkz shares many   parts. But the most annoying thing my local ford dealer couldn't fix was the outside rattle at high speed. On addition, a number started to show a discoloration just after 2 years of use. I will not buy another of your cars, Lincoln, even though I loved this car. The quality to price ratio is not acceptable at the price this car is sold right now.

lincoln,mkz,2015,John Borkowski, 02/17/2016,Impressive Automobile,5,"I owned a hybrid for the last five years but I now need a larger trunk. Scott McCarty, from Plaza Lincoln in Leesburg, FL, located a used MKZ 2.0L I4 GTDI engine with 6 speed transmission with 10000 miles which I purchased. I hoped to get 25 mpg. I have put 2000 miles on the car since. I am pleased to find I get 27 mpg overall.  My mpg at 70 - 75 mph averages 32 which is the same as my hybrid. The engine is  very smooth - feels like a V8 - with plenty of power. The car has a very comfortable ride and has may standard features that you pay extra for on other cars. The car handles very well at both high and low speeds. It has a great warranty and service from Lincoln and the dealer. A very large power trunk, intelligent access with push button start which is very convenient. It has ten way power seats both passenger and driver with power lumbar. The driver seat has memory and they are both heated and cooled. It has heated power mirrors with security approach lamps and adaptive LED head lamps. Navigation and rear view camera. In other words  - it is loaded!

lincoln,mkz,2015,Carey Dentice, 08/18/2015,Best Lincoln ever!,5,"I purchased a brand new 2015 Lincoln MKZ last fall and after almost 8 months still love the car.  I have owned many different car brands (mostly non-US brands) but my MKZ beats them all.  It not only is a sharp looking vehicle but performs great, gets great fuel economy and is a fun car to drive.  I have read reviews saying the Microsoft Sync systems was very difficult to use but it is quite the opposite.  Anyone with limited knowledge (this leaves out the critics) can operate this system.

lincoln,mkz,2015,aranala, 02/24/2015,MKZ Hybrid is an amazing car,5,"I had not owned an American car in 40 years, since I  purchased a Buick Skylark, used. In the intervening years I have owned several Volvos, MBs,  BMWs, and AlfaRomeos, so I purchased this Lincoln with great hesitation.
I chose it because I wanted a mid size confortable car with great mileage. The MKZ, after 11,900 miles is proving to be a very lucky or wise decision.
The MKZ is silent even at 90 MPH on the Florida Turnpike, steering is responsive, tight, ride is like you want it to be, comfy or sporty, the seats are like first class in Lufthansa and it has the quietness of a concert hall to enjoy the jazz coming out of the HD system.
And I´m getting 38 MPG. Very good  .

Very comfortable, seats fit like a glove, everything at your fingertips. Gets lot of compliments. We have had 3 Marks and 1 Town car but this is so exquisite. Love the car but only one tiny drawback... there are no hand grips on either side and having a destroyed back they sure are needed. Otherwise Plus Ten.

lincoln,mkz,2015,AF, 01/03/2017,Wow. Bang for your Buck!,5,"I've lusted after one of these since the '13 redesign. Picked up a low mileage used '15 for half the sticker when new. This car is fantastic. It's like a rolling sanctuary. Super quiet ride, way more power than necessary (4 cyl turbo), with the back seats down there is plenty of room for luggage.  Had several people comment what a gorgeous car this is. I love the panoramic sunroof and lane detection option. Great car, get a used one and you'll have no regrets.

lincoln,mkz,2015,Tim, 10/22/2015,"As luxurious as a Tesla, for easily half the price",5,"I got to thinking the other day about how this car compares to a Tesla Model S I have driven...

I absolutely love 100% electric, and would drive a Tesla in a heartbeat. There is no doubt that the Lincoln is missing the excitement factor of instant torque, but the 'fuel' economy is a negligible savings, and the  overall vehicle cost is night/day. I love the fit and finish of the Lincoln, and the overall ride quality is excellent. The car is costing me about $65/month for gas (1k miles @40mpg /$2.40-$2.50gal), a Tesla would cost about $30/month for electricity (about 250-300Kwh @.10Kwh). To compare lease payments, my numbers are about $600/month difference ($350-400 vs $900-$1k/month over 36 months 12k mile lease). I expect right now it's pretty easy to get a great deal on a hybrid, since sales are slumping. Those 15mpg SUV's are flying off the lot.

For a luxury car, the Lincoln is an excellent value, and I can't really compare it to the Ford Fusion... it's simply a nicer car inside/out (I was impressed by the quality of the current Ford Fusion before looking at the MKZ). I do find it crazy how much the price of the car can balloon once you start adding features. I got the base hybrid version, which has plenty of features for me. Features I wish I had ordered:

Sun Roof OR full glass roof
Blind Spot indicators
Adaptive Cruise Control

lincoln,mkz,2015,silverrarity, 01/06/2015,Great looking car and to drive and own.,5,"Picked up my 2015 MKZ Hybrid on New Year's Eve and so far its a joy to drive.  In the past I've had an Acura TL and 2 Corvettes.  The car I traded in for the Lincoln was a 2008 Toyota Prius and although I loved the Prius I was totally disgusted with Toyota's Service Department and never felt they treated me as a valued customer.
I had done research on the Lincoln months ago and since I wanted another Hybrid with some Luxury Lincoln fit the bill all the way around.
I was impressed with its look and decided to do some hands on research.  I love the look of the BMW, Acura and Audi 5 but overall the Lincoln offered better Quality and used Regular Gas instead of Premium like its competition.
"
lincoln,mkz,2015,Charles, 08/30/2015,"mkz for 22 days, miss it",5,"I rented MKZ 2.0 for 22 days straight, drove it from LA to vegas and back, then LA  to Yosemite, on to santa cruz and back to LA along the pacific coast highway, put on about 2300 miles. When I first got it, I was not too impressed, but as time went on I liked it more and more. I have a high end Lexus at home, so I was spoiled and hard to please, but now I miss the MKZ. I will exchange my Lexus for the MKZ. I was amazed that I was using regular gas and I was getting plenty of power and 32 miles on the highway with 3 people and plenty of heavy stuff in the trunk. I opened the hood, but without taking the motor cover it was not possible to figure out how many cylinder the MKZ had. I liked this car a lot, I liked the handling better than the Lexus I have, the technology, the backup camera etc were great. The driver window would only move up a little and stop, so I had to push the button several times to open or close it. I could not tell if it was malfunctioning, or if it was custom programmed inadvertently by myself, there was no manual in the glove compartment, I guess because it was rental.

lincoln,mkz,2015,Doc, 09/14/2015,Looker...needs a few electronic system refinements,4,"Got the reserve trim with multi-contour (multi-inflatable, infinitely customizable, massaging) seats, Luxe Metallic, THX sound system, 10 spoke wheels with painted slots that almost match the Luxe paint.  It's a great looking car especially with the after-market 35% transmissive side and rear window tint.  Very comfortable, very quiet.  Michelin tires were unexpected.  Update:  Michelin tread lasted only 35,000 miles, though.  Ordered Barum Bravuris tires through Discount Tires which were half the price and seem every bit as good as the Michelins.  Got 40.3 mpg freeway miles back from dealer at 70-75 mph.  Been averaging 41 in all around local driving, mostly suburban.  Luxe paint I really like--goes from a pewter gray with a hint of taupe and even gold in certain light angles.  Wife not crazy about color, though.  I thought it was an interesting switch from the silvers and grays that have been out there for many years.  She wanted white, which to me says, ""fleet car"".  Interior is very modern, flat, and simplified with touch screen and finger sensitive volume and fan sliders.  Unfortunately this system has been discontinued.  Fan speed noise is well muffled except at higher settings. (the Toyota Avalon which we also test drove had much noisier fan).  The Avalon also had too European handling (stiff ride for long distance cruising) at least in the high end trim.  Controls were all very configurable.  My only complaints are two:  (1) the THX system is a waste of money in my opinion.  Yeah, it's powerful and can be set up with a booming base if you like, BUT, the THX system adds that center speaker (in addition to the traditional stereo left and right channels).  That works well in a home or movie theater, but first of all you can't get surround sound very easily because most media doesn't contain the surround channels.  Sirius satellite does not broadcast surround to automobile receivers (I called them about this).  FM HD doesn't contain it (I called 2 station engineers).  CD's generally do not have surround encoded although you supposedly can get them.  Reportedly there also are DVD recordings that contain surround sound, but who buys either of these any more?   Some MP3 downloads reportedly have surround sound so that would likely be your only chance of using this feature. You can set your THX system to chose between ""stereo"" and ""surround"".  I heard no difference in any of the media I played through it.  But this is the real killer:  The front center speaker's volume is factory fixed at 2 to 3 times the volume of the left and right speakers.  This pretty well swamps out the stereo effect that you would hear from the side speakers.  They might as well just have left out the left and right channels and had just the center speaker.  You can compensate somewhat by fading the sound mostly to the rear which diminishes the effect of that loud center front speaker.  If you read the forums you'll see that some have just disconnected the front center speaker, and others replaced the side speakers with more sensitive ones in an effort to balance out the center speaker volume.  THX is an extra $1,000 option--forget it--not worth it.  At least listen to the standard Lincoln audio system, then the THX, before you get excited about the THX ""experience"".  Don't be swayed by the demo THX theater 30 sec. playback.  They just juggle the relative volumes of all the speakers to make it sound impressive.  Doesn't pan out anything close in reality.

Number (2):  The voice command Nav. system is archaic, and updates are expensive. The menus are not intuitive.  Most functions are locked out except when car is stopped.  My $150 Garmin is far superior and updates are free.  Any smart phone will give you much quicker directions these days and it automatically updates.  The screen that comes with the NAV system does give you better control of
 station/media control and cell phone connection.  Update:  It looks like you can buy the annual Nav update SD card for about $50 from Ebay.  Much cheaper than going through dealer.

Performance problem update.  At 35,000 miles in temps above 85 degrees, the gasoline engine started over revving when accelerating.  Normal at temps around 75 degrees.  Also the gasoline engine's rpm's audibly would oscillate slowly up and down a little when driving at constant hwy. speed on level road.  Will take in to dealer next week.  Update:  Problem just went away.  Dealer couldn't find anything.

One very annoying feature that is embarrassing in certain situations:  If you leave the car running and exit with the key fob in your pocket, you get this double full blast of the horn.  It would be nice if it just gave a low volume ""beep, beep"" or something.  Also about half the time when backing up it gives this rapid beeping sound--the same warning alarm that it gives when a car is approaching from either side when you are backing up.  But this one is for ""Check surroundings when backing up""...hardly an emergency.

lincoln,mkz,2015,John C. II, 10/19/2017,I love my Lincoln MKZ!,5,"This car is well built. The fit and finish is first class and the car is very comfortable. One great feature is the choice of drive mode. If you are wanting a comfortable ride and ""every day"" style driving, then choose 'Comfort' Mode. If you are wanting more power, faster acceleration, and much more aggressive handling and steering with a stiffer ride, then choose 'Sport' Mode. And of course, you can change modes at any time. In either mode you will be very happy.

lincoln,mkz,2015,GM2FORD, 08/23/2015,Stunning looks/but bland overall,3,"Although the car presents itself beautifully on the road and is a ""real looker"", there are some things in the interior that need to be changed. I have the rust colored one (not red)  and I get compliments daily on how beautiful the color combination is on the car.  This is my first hybrid and I wanted a luxury car that looked unique and offered luxury amenities that I was used to in my Cadillac CTS and offer really good gas mileage. Well, if you are looking for 39/40mpg, don't bother with this car. I am extremely disappointed in the gas mileage, I am getting 28-30mpg overall, not even close to what Lincoln estimated that the car would get, very disappointing, since I was looking at the Lexus ES300 hybrid as well. The interior is nice, but the seats don't wrap/hug around you, although they are very comfortable and the retractable headrest doesn't adjust forward enough for me to be 100% comfortable. The console storage is awkward to say the least, it has two levels which you have to tweak your hand to get under and place phone keys, wallet, or whatever you want to put under there. It is cramped and tight!
The steering for me is a bit ""boaty"", but it still handles well on the road. The pickup isn't as quick as I would like at times, but that is something I will have to live with for the next 2 - 1/2 yrs since I leased mine and that was the smartest thing I could have done!
The stereo/Sirius radio is great, the retractable side view mirrors are a nice touch/sunroof/moonroof is nice too. The electric trunk is actually quite roomy considering the battery is in there, so no complaints on storage back there. The rear and front parking sensors are a must and are very helpful even with the backup camera.
All in all, I would rate the car a 3.6 out of 5! If the car actually got the 39/40 mpg, I would have rated it around 4.2/5. If you are looking for a beautiful exterior design then this is the car! If you want a car that offers a bit more in the interior, then look elsewhere.

lincoln,mkz,2015,Dave Q, 08/08/2018,Very comfortable car,4,"Acceleration is marginally adequate, with the engine being somewhat noisy.  All controls are touch, which can be quite distracting when trying to manipulate while driving. Later year models have dispensed with much of this or have added some knobs which makes it much easier. The touch screen gets smudged with finger prints VERY easily, making it had to work with the screen in bright daylight.  Overall, very comfortable car and nice to drive, although the ride can be somewhat bouncy and soft.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Hickabilly, 01/04/2016,A step up from my 530xi,5,"I did a month of research selecting a car to trade from my 2007 530xi.  The 530 was a nice car of its time but the maintenance was an absolute wallet breaker.  I had not even considered a Lincoln and was down to a fully loaded Fusion Hybrid, Lexus Hybrid, or GM.  I test drove them all and really liked the layout of the Fusion.  I negotiated price on the Fusion online and would have had one except the sales person at the closest dealer ruined the experience.  So, I took the 530 to Carmax and stumbled on the Lincoln.

Holy cow, I didn't even stumble on a Lincoln Hybrid when researching so I went back to the internet and started reading the reviews.  Most were good.  One fellow had rented a MKZ and had nothing but bad to say.  So, I almost passed on Lincoln.  But I am glad I didn't.

The ride of the MKZ is better than the 530, the interior is really sharp, the road noise is minimal, and it has more power than a Prius that I test drove.  Not much power by comparison to the 530, but more than enough for a stylish commuter car.  The price for the decked out MKZ was about $6k more than a fully decked out Titanium Fusion.  But that $6k really makes a difference.  Comparing the cars, the MKZ is a Fusion with a different console layout, heated rear seats, and different audio system.  But the additional Lincoln drive train warranty, extended hybrid warranty and 3 years of bumper-to-bumper maintenance really make that $6k seem like a big win.  The Fusion seemed more like fitting into a space with the car wrapped around you.  It felt a little cramped.  The MKZ's layout with the low center console that doesn't have a shift lever makes the car feel larger and roomier.  The touch controls for the console are also a very nice difference.  

I was comparing a decked out Fusion Titanium Hybrid with the MKZ so the differences were small otherwise. 

On the road, it is a bit of a turnaround in mental processes to realize I get better mileage in my commute to work than I get on the interstate.  I get why, technically, but it reverses my way of driving.  I won't fall into that trap of trying to maximize mileage at the detriment of all of the other drivers around me.  When there is no-one on the road, I let the car advise me on maximizing efficiency.  But when in traffic, I drive it like my truck.  The MKZ has plenty of power for getting off the starting line and keeping up with traffic.  

Handling is tight and it hugs the road.  The various settings for the comfort of the ride are nice but I spend most of my time in the sport mode which still feels softer than the 530 and yet hugs the curves and corners exceptionally well.  I never drove the 530 in a way that took advantage of its handling so my point of comparison is limited.  With the way I drive, the MKZ is as good as the 530.  And, by the way, the comfort mode is soft and has that floating feeling like a larger car.  I am 6'1"" and I have a few inches of headroom.  I didn't get the crazy Lincoln retracting roof as I didn't like the look of it.  I almost never opened the moon roof on the 530 (mainly because of the wind noise) so I sought out one with just a moon roof instead of that panoramic thing.  And I must say... the MKZ is far quieter when the cover to the moon roof is open.  The 530 had sound insulation on the moon roof because even when closed it was like sticking your ear to the window of a jet airplane.  But the MKZ is pretty much silent even when the sliding cover is open.

I have had the car for a month.  The only negative that I have identified is that it has a pull to the left when accelerating.  But otherwise, I consider this purchase a big step up from the 2007 530xi for a lot less in initial cost and ongoing maintenance. 

I read the reviews indicating that the Fusions computer reported gas mileage is different than real-world experience.  But so far, measured by the mile and
 measured gallons used to fill it, the computer reported mileage is spot on with what I calculate.

Even with gas prices at $2.15 gallon, there's something exhilarating about getting over 40 mpg with a car as large and luxurious as this one. I've filled the tank with gas three times with 42.6 mpg the lowest mileage for the tank. Individual trips have been higher than 50mpg and as low as 37.8 mpg which was 100% highway driving at 70-75 mph.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Matt, 12/27/2015,Great Dark Horse Luxury Car,5,"This car is truly the dark horse of luxury cars. I've owned everything from recent Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, model cars. Overall, the 2016 Lincoln MKZ is the best value. Here's why: 

Unlike Mercedes, Lincoln's don't cost an arm and a leg to fix. I also want to be DIFFERENT and not drive the stereotypical ""Mercedes"". 

Compared to the BLAND styling of current Lexus models, this car is a killer! Beautiful lines, design, and interior. 

Sure, the 2.0 Hybrid model doesn't perform like a BMW, but the MKZ will get 40MPG, take 87 octane, and rides more luxuriously IMO. 

I am very proud that our country makes a luxury car that goes toe-to-toe with imports! Great job Lincoln. The 2016 MKZ is a winner.

lincoln,mkz,2016,David Craft, 08/30/2015,One Fine Car !!!!,5,"I do not get some of the reviews I am reading about the Lincoln MKZ.
I have owned a lot of cars in my life and this car has me very excited for the first time in a long time.
It is absolutely a work of art. 
I was a BMW FAN until now. My wife and I went to the BMW dealer to buy a 328i or a 528i and we test drove both and touched a felt everything about the car. We just were not that impressed. The 328i was just to small and cramped inside. The 528i was much better but just did not seem to be the quality interior we expected.
So we went to our local Lincoln dealer and test drove the MKZ. 
Wow the interior was all upholstered and soft, the sleek design was very impressive and the ride was just what we were looking for.
We got the technology package with ours and I highly recommend it. 
The ride in this car in comfort mode was absolutely luxurious. The car also has two other modes that are also impressive if you want a car that connects to the road and gives you the feel of a BMW. I like these options. 
There are so many features in this car I cannot even begin to tell you all of them.
All I know is whether you own this car for one week or three years you will never get tired of it and you will be very proud to own it.
I wish I had more time to write more about this car, however take it from this very happy owner you owe it to yourself to test drive this baby it is a head turner.

My last four cars were Mercedes, the very last one was a Mercedes E550 W211 - I love every Mercedes I owned.  But I can truly say that I am VERY IMPRESSED with the MKZ.  It has a great ride, a very attractive design and lots of features.  The My Sync feature is very information, I specially link the FREE My Sync - SERVICE option, which you need to register every year for online, but it's free.  I also like the Lincoln App, it provides lots of information on the vehicle and the Support Section provides videos on ""How - To"" use all the vehicle features.  Ford has done a fantastic job with their website site support also.

You can also run alternative fuel - but none of the manufactures want you to know that :-).

Awesome car - and Ford has done a fantastic job on the Support App and their website.  Thanks Ford, I will be back for a new one in three years.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Scott C in SoCal, 10/19/2017,Not my father's Lincoln,5,"A few years ago, I decided I wanted a hybrid, and I started looking into the various types. I decided I like the way Ford did it, and I found a good deal on a used Mercury Milan. I liked that car so much, when it came time for another one I decided I wanted another Ford - with features. Adaptive cruise was important, rear camera, blind spot monitoring, parking sensors, lane keep assist - these were all things I knew I wanted. Oh, and leather upholstery. And a good stereo system. I looked and Ford didn't have it, at least under the Ford badge. But Lincoln did. After a few months of searching I found an off-lease Lincoln MKZ with Reserve package, Technology package, THX sound system, and for good measure the seats with Active Motion (a massage feature). As a 2016, buying in 2017, I paid about half the price new, and I got it as a Lincoln CPO, which extended the warranty to 100K miles. I've had it for several weeks now, and I love this car. It's rated at 41mpg, I'm getting about 43 on my commute. It's comfortable, it makes my drive less stressful, the ride is smooth enough to relax, yet taut enough to give handling confidence, and I'm so glad I bought it. I've only played with the seat massage a few times, but on long trips when my legs start to cramp up, this will be exactly what I need. Good job, Lincoln.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Bob, 03/01/2016,A Proud MKZ Owner,5,"I took delivery in October 2015 of my new Lincoln MKZ and have never, ever been so delighted with a new car. I decided on the 2.0 turbo and it's quick. The car acts like a stallion that wants to run fast....and it often takes restraint on my part to watch my speed. You don't realize how fast you are going since the car is quiet and so smooth. I particularly love the Push Button Shift selection, which eliminates the cumbersome shifter all other vehicles have. Also love the sliding volume and temperature controls. After driving the Dodge Charger and it's obstructed front view I was so impressed with the MKZ panoramic front view. I also love the cool LED taillights...much more suttle than the GLARING Dodge Charger rear lights. Lincoln sold me on this car. It's a car that makes you want to drive it all the time. In closing,  I highly recommend shoppers to test drive this car. Outstanding car to drive/own. (UPDATE) Unfortunately, my daughter ""borrowed"" my car and hours later smashed the front end resulting in extensive repairs. !!😵

It is comfy, easy to drive, sips gas and, best of all, I have been averaging 41 mpg!! It also looks great and has an awesome panoramic sunroof. Its been in the 80's - 90's this summer, so the cooled seats and ac have come in handy and work great. There are plenty of cup holders and places for storage. The only drawback is that it sits quite low to the ground, not a problem for driving but can be an issue for parking. If you come too far forward you may scrape the bottom of the front on the concrete stopper or sidewalk in front of you. The trunk is a little small, but its fine for day to day commuting and grocery shopping. Stereo system and touch screen are easy to use. My hubby is 6'4"" and he fits in the car great- plenty of room in the back for our teens too. The Ogden Lincoln dealership in Westmont was great to work with. I still couldn't be happier.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Rick, 08/14/2015,2016 Bronze Fire Hybrid,5,"I cannot understand the critics.. interior is NOT the cheap looking space they claim.. I am very happy with my new baby!.. driving in pouring rain, the headlights do cut thru and give you good sight.. the headlights turn as you are turning and follow the path.. the outside mirrors are coated and seem to cut the glare of the headlights following.. Take a little time and the 4 quads of My Lincoln Touch... is NOT the bad thing that the critics complain about..  Overall this car is fun to drive and a  nice looking vehicle.. It's about as much a comparison to a Fusion as the Lexus are to the Camry..
Now after owning it for a year I still like it..in bad weather, the LED headlights really cute thru..the cooled seats are great and preconditioning it is nice in cold and hot weather

lincoln,mkz,2016,Bob, 02/24/2016,I Am Now Known As Mr MKZ,5,"I took delivery of my 2016 MKZ in October and had my plates personalized as MR MKZ. I cannot express how wonderful this car rides and performs. I turn heads in my neighborhood (full of foreign cars) and are often asked who makes this car. I cannot think of one thing negative about this car. I did notice this car wants to run fast and often realize I'm driving faster than it seems. Kudos to Lincoln on a superior ride. I did opt for the 19 inch wheels since I think it gives the car a nice profile. 5 stars + Totally satisfied customer!!

The vehicle itself is amazing, responsive, elegant and comfortable.  Additionally, everyone ask about it, admires its beauty, and loves the interior.

lincoln,mkz,2016,bobh, 05/26/2017,PLEASE READ THIS LINCOLN. I'VE HAD 4 MKZs now.,4,"I have had 4 MKZ's in a row and that should tell you that ""overall"" I was pretty pleased with the car.  As they continued to improved, I continued to try the next version.        First, the good stuff!       1//// Runs on regular gas.          2//// I can't say enough about that 4 cyl. ecoboost engine. My previous 3 had v6 3.7, so I was expecting an egg beater similar to some 4 cyl Volvo's I had tried. THAT ENGINE is incredibly quiet, quick and smooth.  I can be going 70 and kick it and be at 95 in a flash. Really a marvelous engine.      3//// The quick fill gas tank that has no cap to unscrew...you'll LOVE it.      4///// Seats are better-than-average-comfortable but still not to die for like some of the Euro's.     5/////// Unlike the heavy iron Euros I've had in the past from Germany and England (at the time), the wheels don't get black from brake dust.      6//////  The fold down rear seats have come in handy many times.     7/////////  A lot of car people trashed the split wing grill but I'll tell ya, I've had more than a few tell me they like it a lot. HELL, if ya wanna trash a front end, look at whatever it is LEXUS is doing!  Downright UGLY. I don't mind it all but if it were true chrome it may have added some sparkle.  I DO like it better than the 2017 grill because that grill looks more like an old time heating regulator you'd find in old houses to let heat rise up from below. HOWEVER, from a 45 degree angle it looks REALLY good, head-on though, it's just doesn't look ""refined"". Surprised they didn't dress it up more in the Continental.   8/// The 4 cyl is pretty fuel efficient and I don't miss the 6 cyl at all and yes, I do have a heavy foot at times.   9///// It just runs well and drives just fine for a sedan.  OKAY NOW FOR SOME OF THE BAD STUFF.   1///// The look of the dash etc. is just fine and kinda cool as well......BUT............THE NAV SCREEN (et al.) needs to be set in and angled to prevent sunlight glare. Mid-Day in Florida where the sun shines 350 days a year?  Forget about it, you can barely see it at max lumination settings.  Also, by sticking out at the angle it's on, it shows ALL FINGERPRINTS and you'll be wiping that screen continuously.  Looks crappy.  It needs to be set back with a hood and maybe angled more vertically.   2//////They did away with sync for life of car so it expires after 6 months.  It's nice to have but not worth the extra money in my opinion.   They're my two biggest gripes and that screen the biggest.  I'm told there might be some interesting changes coming in 2018 and if some issues are addressed then, I'll probably get another. Otherwise, it's off to Europe again.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Douglas H, 07/22/2016,What a value for a delightul experience,5,"I bought my MkZ a month ago. It is delightful; the experience at the dealership, the car itself, the little touches that provide an experience of specialness combine to deliver the most impressive auto ownership experience I have had in nearly forty years of new car ownership. The MkZ is not a BMW, it is an American luxury experience that brings forward design and experiential elements going back more than forty years. The MkZ is unique in that it can be calibrated to ride and handle like a classic Town Car, or a responsive mid-sized car, or something in between. My MkZ is a Black Label, which is probably the best luxury/premium value in the marketplace between the unique trim like the Mark IV and V series of the late 1970s and additional services that no other luxury brand offers. Those few reviews that I've seen complain about the MkZ that it isn't a BMW - what a boring place this would be if every choice were the same. The MkZ gives the buyer who finds its qualities to be pleasing a blend of traditional American luxury, handling, and unique styling. Fully loaded, it's an absolute bargain as compared to its entire field of competition and the dealer experience is the best in the industry.

My car has the 3.7L V6 FWD - Edmunds didn't offer that combination

It is quiet, comfortable, and enjoyable to drive ……I feel safe…also a HUGE priority….I have only had it for a month now, but I am impressed thus far.  Happy with my choice.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Amy, 11/06/2016,The beast,5,"love this new 2016 mkz hybrid.  It's a big, luxurious beast of a sedan that gets 39.2 mpg consistently.  I do about 62 miles each way commute each day and wanted to upgrade in ride from my Toyota Prius. Boy is this an upgrade!  Total luxury top to bottom , lumbar seat adjustable, which is key now that I'm in my 50s and the back has gotten weaker over the years. I used to be in pain from the Prius seats with this long commute, not any more!  I'm really enjoying this car. It's way more car then I could've afforded in a mercedes, Audi or Lexus. I had an Audi. A6 that we purchase used, this Lincoln is comperable but better. I love the touch screen controls, am not a tech person at all, so I don't understand the issues people say they have with it.  Love the car.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Dave, 12/06/2016,"Good car, excellent car company",5,"I am quite pleased with this automobile.  I love the technology features such as lane assist, active cruise control, reversing camera, lane departure warning, and (surprisingly) rain sensing wipers.  I love the multi contour active motion seats.  My only two complaints are one major, the electric power steering is well weighted, has good turn in, etc. but does not have enough road feel.  I understand this is true of all EPS including the cars I have driven that have it.  (It is much better than a 2015 Toyota Camry that I rented this year.)  The second is less of a problem and that is there needs to be more non-touch screen controls for the HVAC.  Finally, I have been very impressed with Lincoln Motor Company.  They are very responsive and after I brought to their attention that I thought the car took much longer to build than I think it should have, they gave me a 100,000 mile warranty.  I have found that “company care” is very important for an expensive and complex device such as this one.  Good job!
Since Ford Motor Company announced no more sales of cars in the US save for the Mustang the resale value has plummeted.

lincoln,mkz,2016,Dissatisfied customer, 08/18/2016,Trade in value similar to a compact Ford Focus,4,"Shopper you need to be aware of the trade in value of this car.  We purchased the MKZ about 7 months ago and wanted to trade it on for SUV.  This cars value dropped from MSRP of 42,000 to 22000 trade in value.   This is not just from the dealer where we tried to trade, but actually we couldn't find a Lincoln dealer that displayed any interest in trading for this car.  KBB list the car with a ver low trade in value.  If you plan to drive the car you're fine, but if you trade often stay away!

lincoln,mkz,2016,Benjamin Jones, 12/13/2015,2016 MKZ Hybrid - NOT worth the money!,3,"1. MKZ Hybrid is advertised as getting 40+ mpg city/highway. I promise you it will never, ever do that. The best my wife and I ever get is 36.6. Our average is between 30 and 35. So don't be fooled by the salesman.
2. The style is actually incredible. We both love the look and feel of the interior. The outside is pretty sleek as well, but the ""white"" version is not a true white - more of a pearlescent white.
3. At a full tank the dash reads 500 miles to empty, give or take some. We get maybe 350 miles before we have to actually fill up, so do not be fooled into thinking that a brand new car is any more advanced than its predecessors. My old pickup truck is more accurate in fuel estimation.
4. Here's the biggest freaking problem we had with this car: It has had 2 mechanical repairs and 1 fuel efficiency evaluation done on it since we drove it off the lot a few months ago. The dealership in Stockton put up a huge fuss about how this couldn't be really happening, it never happens to these cars, and we must be mistaken. Well we were not mistaken. A fuel fumes leak was repaired, a purge valve was replaced, and we insisted they give us an extra 10,000 miles on the lease because of the incredible disappointment this car has been for us.
It will not get the amazing gas mileage promised, it has a very slow and low performing engine, there is minimal trunk space, and our dealership (even though they make it seem like Lincoln owners get treated SO much better) treated us like trash. I am not kidding when I say that I had to call them countless time to even get an answer on our problems. It was a full-scale disaster.
My suggestion: buy Ford Fusion hybrid if you want the American made car. It's the same engine system as the MKZ Hybrid and its like 30% cheaper! Don't fork out big money for something that doesn't deserve it and won't earn it.

"
lincoln,mkz,2016,Simon, 09/25/2016,Improvements badly needed!,3,"It is a nice looking car, but it has multiple shortcomings. Six cylinder engine does not have massive torque and it is thirsty. Transmission is not particularly smooth and holds high RPM at highway speeds, which contributes to a high fuel consumption. Steering is not intuitive and steering wheel is hard to turn. Headlights are LED, but lighting perimeter is short and dark. Touch sensitive screen controls are slow to respond. Navigation screen has 2-4 seconds delay, while changing scenes. Though I just drove 1100 miles, I've been in the dealership multiple times for rattles and vibrations. Quality of interior materials are left to be desired. Leather on the seats bubbles and finger prints are easily shown everywhere, including navigation screen. Cooled seats only cool bottom cushion, but not seat back. Dealership said it is normal. It takes 15 minutes for the heated seats to start operating. THX audio system is a big disappointment. No matter what setting you choose, it sounds dull and subdued.
"
lincoln,mkz,2016,Donald Geeze, 01/03/2016,Trying too hard,4,"Beautiful and unique exterior. Luxurious interior.  Quality of interior materials still not up to the Lexus ES standard. Very quiet when cruising, but unpleasant engine noise on acceleration, and does not accelerate nearly as well as the Lexus ES hybrid. Electronics do all the things you'd like, if you can figure out how to use them. Excessively non-intuituve inputs for simple commands. 
The drivetrain and the design of the electronics interface need work. What's wrong with simple buttons and knobs? Back seat is hard. 
Still a tempting car with it's comfort and appearance.
"
lincoln,mkz,2016,Miguel Torres, 10/21/2016,This car has a harder learning curve than most,3,"First of all, I own a 3.7 V-6, which was not given as one of the options on this page, so I entered the 2.0 option. I bought the car pre-owned (almost new, with 8k miles) and saved almost $20,000 in the process. My first impressions were very negative, but I've reconsidered them after living with the vehicle a couple of weeks. 
1. The ergonomics are OK even though I'd like to see less of a drop from the seat level to the feet space. 
2. Electronic controls were a pain in the beginning, and it takes a while to get used to them. They are not as responsive as manual controls, and sometimes they're over-responsive, depending on their mood. Why do manufacturers think that everything high-tech and automated is better when it's not? However, once you set everything up according to your preference, you can forget about them.
3. The car flies, especially in the sport mode. It has effortless acceleration and a beautiful V-6 sound. 
4. I drained the battery when I first brought it home since I didn't know how to properly lock the car. You press the lock sign twice until you hear the sound. That kills all the lights after a few seconds. Make sure you check visually that all the light are off. 
I will probably consider buying another MKZ in a couple of years since the 2017 V-6 versions have 350 and 400 hp respectively and since both have twin-turbos. The 400 hp version is AWD to boot. Of course, it depends on whether I can get as good a deal on a pre-owned one as my current MKZ.

Six months later and all I can say is I love my MKZ even more!

Initial Review
Cars are emotional purchases. You have to form an attachment. But there are rational reasons that make us select the cars we love. My attachment to the MKZ starts with its lines. I believe the MKZ's design will age well. The interior is smooth, elegant and user friendly, rich with wood and leather. My MKZ includes the Tech Package and I have all the features engaged. I love the adaptive cruise, which works so well and so smooth that it like all the Tech pack features make me a better driver. I'm infatuated by technology in vehicles and that's why I love the Park Assist.

I could go on. But let me end by saying that I have owned Buick's, BMW's, Cadillac's, a Lexus and several Mercedes Benz's yet I am most proud of this emotional purchase for the rational reasons I layed out. It has the best of all the things I require in a car including the ""convenient luxury"" and ownership experience of a Lincoln.

Check one out. I think you'll agree.

lincoln,mkz,2016,J Hickman, 11/28/2017,My Fantasy Failed! I'm Going Back To Cadillac!,2,"Update: 70k Exceptionally serviced and maintained miles... Lincoln has lost my loyalty for many years to come, if not forever. MKZ was rapidly going downhill. Transmission slammed when quickly accelerating, suspension had gone to hell and cabin became gas chamber when accelerating over 50 mph. After two years of wanting one, followed by two years owning one I have never been so disappointed by a car; yet so relieved to have gotten rid of it. 
We traded it in for Jaguar XJL and couldn’t be happier, except for the trade in allowance. It was three/four years old, was a loaded high end model, performance 6 cylinder and in excellent condition; yet trade in value was only $6k. 

Previous review: Our car is a 6 cyl AWD but it was not an option on the drop down menu. After a year of wanting it we purchased it with 20k and at about 9 months old, to avoid massive depreciation of a new car. At 35k it has now been in the Service Dept three times. 1) Replace Heads 2) Replace most of the transmission 3) Computer and additional engine work (weeks after #2). The exterior and interior design of the car is very nice. The front cabin is ok for a luxury sports car. The technology is already obsolete which really angers me. The mechanics of the car infuriates me! When accelerating and idling we get gassed with exhaust fumes. 
I will be going back to Cadillac.

"
lincoln,mkz,2016,Chris Healey, 07/22/2015,Run Away!,1,"I was 'upgraded' to the 2016 MKZ 3.7L (Edmunds won't let me select the 3.7L engine option), as a rental car this week and I've been driving it all week.  And I have to day this is the worst car in this class I have driven in a very long time.

First off it is UGLY.  I mean really ugly.  At the front it is channelling a PT Cruiser and the back reminds me of some French car from years ago.  In other words the great looks of the Fusion it is based upon have been kicked to the curb in favor of a monstrosity that no one could possibly find attractive.

The interior looks like it might be premium in some aspects, but upon closer inspection, they disappoint.  Edmunds was generous giving it a C.

It feels lively enough off the line, but stomp the right foot and expect some disturbing torque steer.  Ford engineers need to buy a VW GTI and figure out why a car that costs $10K less has solved the problem of torque steer, and they seemingly cannot.

I enjoyed no aspect of driving this car.  The handling sucks, it is not especially quick, although feels quicker because you are dealing with the torque steer drama.  The interior lacks any kind of premium features one would expect of a car in the mid $30s.  The car before the car I own now was a CPO Mercedes C Class.  Given the choice between a 9 month old CPO fully loaded Mercedes, and this junker, it's a no brainer.

Don't like used cars, even CPO?  Well heck, you can buy a Mercedes CLA or BMW 320 for the same price as this Lincoln.  And the latter includes four years of free servicing, along with a ride and handling that will put this MKZ to shame.

When the price tag tips past $30K there are a wealth of cars available from great very young CPO offerings, to excellent new choices.  You have top of the line regular cars, and entry level luxury cars.  And the bottom line; this car simply doesn't compete.  It doesn't bring enough to the table to stand out, or even be noticed.  I honestly can't think of a single match up with any $35K car, that this comes close to winning.

To me the only buyer for this car would be someone who is a die hard Lincoln fan and someone who has never driven any other $35K car.  Because trust me I have shopped this segment extensively and driven dozens of rentals in a similar price point, and everything trounces this car.

The sad thing is, I actually have a soft spot for the Fusion.  The most recent makeover that borrowed from Aston Martin styling cues was a huge upgrade on the old dated Fusion.  So to give the Fusion the fugly make over, charge $15K more, and not even offer basics like an adjustable steering column or sunroof is kind of a joke.

Make a list of cars priced $30K - $40K stick a pin in it, and you'll have a better car than this.  Edmunds says C, I say F.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Lincoln convert, 09/09/2016,Great ride,5,"My Lincoln dealer got his first 2017 with the driver's package option.  Not cheap at $3300 but oh so worth it.  With the 400hp engine and AWD this thing is an Audi/BMW clone for tens of thousands less.  Spent over an hour test driving it.  Came back to the dealership and ordered my own.  Left out the luxury package ($4400) and some other stuff.  MSRP came in at just under $50K.  Not an Audi or a BMW but certainly close enough especially when factoring in the MSRP differential.  Service costs will be dramatically less than with the Germans cars (I had 4 Audis over the course of 30 years).  For 2017 Lincoln is offering to pick up your car at your home or place of business for service and return it to you.  A nice touch.  Nothing I will take advantage of as my local dealer is less than 4 miles from my house.  My local Audi dealer was 30 miles away.  The car is fast, quiet, comfortable, well put together, no wind noise, etc.  Seems to be a great alternative to its German and Japanese counterparts.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Jonathan Quick, 10/28/2016,Good value from a traditional American car company,4,"UPDATE 12-27-17
Updating my review on this vehicle based on 14 months of ownership.    Overall, I remain satisfied with my Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.   In spite of some minor fit and finish issues, the styling of this sedan really stands out against a tired landscape of look-alike sedans from other car manufacturers.   Fuel economy remains rock solid between 40 and 41 mpg in mixed city/highway driving.   ADAS features for accident avoidance, parking, and maintaining driver awareness have been great.  Quiet comfort sticks out as a real differentiator compared to other vehicles in the entry level luxury sedan segment. The biggest issue with maintaining the vehicle has been the synchronization of firmware updates across the numerous vehicle subsystems within the car.   Sync 3 had a lot of bugs at first, but three firmware updates later, all of the infotainment and navigation features appear to be working normally.   Unfortunately, I had to make repeat visits to the dealership to stabilize other subsystems.  The worst problem I have encountered  was a drained battery that stranded my car in my own garage.  Lincoln corrected the battery drain issue with a firmware update to the door control module.  Although I have experienced a few warranty issues, my local Lincoln dealer and the Lincoln concierge service have done a great job of addressing my concerns.  I would still recommend the MKZ Hybrid as a solid value compared to other vehicles in its class.   However, prospective buyers should strongly consider purchasing Lincoln's extended warranty for this vehicle.


ORIGINAL REVIEW
I purchased a 2017 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Reserve w/ Technology package in September 2016.   Purchase price was $8k - $20k below comparable European and Japanese alternatives.   I have thus far driven the car about 2200 miles, about 80% highway driving and 20% city driving.   Average MPG is around 40 - 42 mpg.   Acceleration is adequate in most situations.    The smoothness of the powertrain, well-tuned suspension, and the quiet cabin at highway cruising speeds really attracted me to this vehicle.   Exterior appearance is impressive and fairly unique, but some of the exterior trim pieces are made of low quality plastic.  Quality of interior materials is very good - particularly the wood trim and leather upholstery.  ADAS features including adaptive cruise, accident avoidance, blindspot monitoring, backup-assist and lane-keep assist are very useful in day-to-day driving.  Lincoln's driver assistance features are unobtrusive until really needed. The on-board infotainment system is light years ahead of Toyota and BMW in terms of usability, but the Sync 3 system has bugs around IPod indexing, accuracy of on-board clock, Android Auto compatibility, and stability of mobile apps.   One bright spot in Sync 3 is Lincoln's NAV system coupled with Sirius traffic information, which is a real godsend for avoiding heavy traffic at rush hour.   Unfortunately, the stability issues I've encountered in Sync 3 appear to extend to other vehicle subsystems.  I presently suspect electrical gremlins are lurking in the interior lighting system and the sound system, although all installed equipment is performing normally for the moment.   As long as reliability holds up, backed in part by Lincoln's long base warranty, I expect I will remain satisfied with this vehicle.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Greg, 02/28/2018,Hot Rod Lincoln indeed,5,"I have an MKZ Reserve with the 400 hp engine, AWD, Driver Sport Package, Technology Package, Luxury Package, Climate Package and Power Moonroof. In Midnight Sapphire Blue Metallic, it is absolutely stunning with the two-tone interior that comes with the Driver Sport Package. I really didn't see me driving a domestic car let alone a Lincoln as my most recent cars were all imports: Audi S4, Volvo S60 R-Design, Infiniti M37 Sport and Infiniti M35 Sport. Nearly went for an Audi S5 Sportback as a replacement but the change from a supercharger to turbo was a little disappointing. The MKZ intrigued me especially the shape; much like an Audi S7 but thousands of $$$ less. A test drive absolutely sold me. I wanted something a little bigger than the Audi but would still go like stink and handle well. Lincoln absolutely has this car dialed in. There have been gripes about the quality of the interior materials and coming from an Audi which I think has one of the best interiors, I really can't complain. The comfort, technology, performance and overall satisfaction with the vehicle are all there for me. The upgraded Revel sound system is a ridiculous amount of money but worth every penny if you love your music as I do. The MKZ could use a 7 or 8 speed transmission to help with the fuel economy but if I was looking for great fuel economy I'd be driving a Prius. The best sleeper luxury performance sedan on the road. Fantastic car!!!

lincoln,mkz,2017,Paul, 07/13/2017,Never thought I would buy a Lincoln,5,"Great value in the MKZ.  It's a perfect size sedan that's very comfortable.  Others in his price range are noticeably smalller.  The 2.0 turbo 4 has plenty of power for normal driving.  Unlike other turbo 4's that I've driven this engine has power from a dead stop.  Very little turbo lag.  Although the 400 HP V6 was tempting, I decided to stick with the 4 because I was concerned about how bad the mileage would be in N.Y. stop and go traffic.  I was also on the fence about the  AWD but I have to admit it's nice to have zero wheel spin when pulling away from a dead stop in the rain.  If your more interested in 0-60 times or how many G's  the car pulls on a skid pad then this car probably isn't for you.  As a former muscle car guy acceleration was once very important to me.  30 years later however it's now all about comfort for me.    If you read the reviews the MKZ gets a lot of criticism because it shares the platform with the Ford Fusion (Which also happens to be a great car).  My view on this is who cares.  I never see the same criticism about Honda parts in Acura's or VW parts in Audi's.  No regrets at all.  Very happy with our choice.  Fantastic looking car that stands out from the crowd. Worth taking a look at even if you never thought about a Lincoln.

Here's my update.  It's been a little over a year and we still love our MKZ.  We've only been back to the dealer one time for the first oil change.  No issues at all.  This car really doesn't get a fair shake from the reviewers.  Great value for the money.  Every other car in this price range is substantially smaller.  I don't however think a loaded or black label edition of this car is worth the money.  We got every option that we wanted and still kept it well under 40K.  A black label edition can run close to 60K.  Otherwise I would strongly recommend taking a look at the MKZ.

Here's another update.  Weve owned the car over a year and a half and have about 12k on the odometer.  Still don't understand why this car gets terrible reviews.  No problems at all.  Great value for the money.  No regrets at all.

 Well here’s another update.   Nothing has changed. With over 16,000 miles now on the odometer no trouble at all and still love the car.
Another update.  It’s been almost 4 years since we purchased the MKZ.  We now have about 25K on the odometer.  One problem to report.  Passenger side front axle developed a noise.  Replaced under warranty at no charge.  Problem solved.  Still love the car.  Mileage has gone up since we no longer live in a area with ridiculous traffic.  Now getting close to 20 mpg city and around 28-29 on the highway cruising at 70 mph.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Daniel Justin, 11/18/2016,A quiet comfortable and smooth ride,5,"I just traded in my Toyota Avalon Hybrid for this 2017 Lincoln MKZ hybrid and I am glad I did. American cars have really improved. This is one comfortable-quiet-smooth ride. You get so much more for your money. I am averaging 40 MPG although I am a conservative driver. The only downside to this car is that the acceleration is a bit on the slow side, although that is not a problem for me personally. Its like driving with the eco on all the time. And the other downside is the very small trunk area and no spare tire. But everything else is fantastic. From the very first look and test drive I knew this was the car for me. The dealership really took care of me and they made the experience simple and easy. It takes some time to learn all of the in's and out's that the vehicle can do, but that is understandable considering the complexity of the system. I am a car nut and I am really digging this ride. If only the traffic out there wasn't so insane.
"
lincoln,mkz,2017,Gary, 09/25/2016,Great Ride at an acceptable Price,5,"You will be happy to own this vehicle.  Great styling with lots of extras and the ride is super.  Very Comfortable.  This is an update to my pervious review and I don't see how you would beat a Lincoln.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Mr. Bill, 08/05/2016,From Lexus to Lincoln MKZ,5,"Just clocked the first 1500 miles om my brand new leased 2017 Lincoln MKZ. In a word everything about this car is great!!  My past 5 cars were all Lexus ES 350's but on this trade the dealer let me take a MKZ I liked for the 4th of July weekend and the day I returned it, it was mine. The technology on this car is overwhelming, the comfort is just what my body has always wanted in a car and the looks are demanding attention and good comments from all quarters. I feel truly secure in this car from all perspectives. My Lexu's were great cars but Lincoln did Lexus one better this time around with the MKZ.      Mr. Bill

lincoln,mkz,2017,Joe, 01/03/2017,3.0 Hot Rod Lincoln,5,"Hi, so the site didn't, give me the chance to enter the right model. I now have about 2,000 miles on a 2017 MKZ 3.0L V6 AWD sedan. I'm pleasantly surprised as I didn't have a chance to drive this combination when I ordered it. I drove the 4 cylinder turbo, and it was Ok, but certainly not exciting. I compared mainly against the Audi A4 and the BMW 330i. The Audi was a bit underwhelming to tell the truth. All of the reviews rave about the interior, but I just wasn't convinced. I really disliked the nav screen sitting up on top of the instrument panel. I loved the idea of ordering a 330i with a manual transmission, but realized the resale would be poor.  The BMW interior didn't really impress either, though there is a kind of throwback look to it that I liked. The two BMW dealers I visited were also less than accommodating. They pushed leasing, while I prefer to buy. Anyhow, I wound up ordering the MKZ Reserve with the big engine, and I'm very pleased.  High tech safety features, very quick acceleration, and I have yet to find a flaw side or out.
Ok so with nearly 10,000 miles I have had a couple things needing repair. First was a buzzing noise from one of the speakers in the drivers door. That was repaired by the dealer to my satisfaction. The dealer claimed a clip of some sort was missing or defective. The other problem is a power window that won't properly roll up. It's as if it's sensing an object in the way. So it rolls up 80% of the way, and goes back down. The dealer had to reprogram a module of some sort to let it operate properly.  If you nudge the window up slowly, it would close, but not automatically. I'm glad that's fixed. The dealer gave me a loaner and oil change as promised.
Overall, I'm still very pleased. By the way, I drive very steady and fairly conservatively on the daily freeway commute. The 27 MPG is not a mistake. That's with AC now in summer, and the occasional full throttle blast when necessary.
Update as of 1/5/2018: I now have just over 19,000 miles on the car, and I'm still very pleased.  I'm still averaging 27 MPG in mostly urban freeway driving, and that's on regular unleaded.  The 3.0L V6 engine has more than enough power for me, so only on a couple occasions have I filled with premium unleaded just to see if there was a big performance increase.
No reason to return the car to the dealer for any service work, as I'm now doing full synthetic oil changes elsewhere.
If I was to criticize anything, it would be the rather narrow opening of the trunk lid.  The fastback design of the rear window forces a smaller opening.  Normally it shouldn't be a problem, but I was trying to transport a few of those big plastic storage bins, and had to fold the rear seats down and load through the rear doors.
Overall, I'm still very pleased.
July 2018 with 29,000 miles. I needed to return the car for service as the oil pan required a new seal. There was a very minor leak, but the dealer was very accommodating with free loaner and of course, oil change. So although I was somewhat inconvenienced, I realize it’s a new engine design miles of mostly highway travel is 27.2...better than expected.
July 2019 and the MKZ is at just over 46,000 miles. No problems or issues to speak of. Actually still on the original Michelin tires, but ready to change out soon.  Mileage is consistent at 27.3 average since new, mostly highway commuting. Paint is gorgeous, leather interior still looks and smells great. No oil consumption between changes of full synthetic. Overall still a very fine car.

lincoln,mkz,2017,JohnMatt, 11/29/2016,My First Lincoln in 62 Years,4,"I've driven many cars during that time including Acuras, BMWs and Mercedes' recently.  Their prices have risen too high for what you get, and the styling is nothing to cheer about (2017 MB  has an IPAD glued to the dashboard).  When I saw the 2017 Lincoln MKZ I was curious because the styling was fresh and the price was right.  No undesired extras that were built into my choice, keeping the price reasonable.  And the salesman I used was completely knowledgeable about the models and accessories so he could answer every question I raised, and the sales discounts happened to be available during the negotiation.    The car is just what I wanted, although with a few  negatives.  It is spacious front and back with good seating quality (I don't use leather seats).  The trunk is large and holds my golf clubs easily, or several large suitcases.  The turbo-charged 4-cylinder engine (245 HP) has adequate acceleration and highway comfort, but feels a bit strained somewhat when trying to accelerate at high speeds.  The fuel recommended is regular (87), but I use mid-grade (89) for better performance.  The car has Ford SYNC for music and other electronic adjustments, which works well.  It has several USB and 12-volt ports for the smart phone users, as well as Sirius if desired.  One issue with me is the small buttons on the bottom of the steering wheel for answering phones using Bluetooth and setting the cruise control.  Hard to select and use when driving.  Uses a smart key fob remote for starting, entering and leaving, and pushbutton gear selectors (P,D,N,R).  This car is not a sports car, so don't expect that.  The 400 HP V6 may satisfy the power, but handling might not be there. I hope this description helps with your decision to buy or not.

lincoln,mkz,2017,oldsnwbrdr, 04/30/2017,Quiet Luxury,5,"I rented a Continental recently and have driven (and just leased) an MKZ, and Lincoln is doing a great job building quiet luxury cars.  It's refreshing that they aren't chasing BMW owners intent on 0-60 times, 60-0 braking, hard cornering, etc.  This car isn't about that--if you prefer old school Lincoln, Lexus, etc. I think you will really enjoy this car.  I test drove multiple versions before finally settling on a ""basic"" Select model with the Select Plus and Climate packages, and the moonroof.  I drove the V6 and really enjoyed it, but I'm coming out of a Fusion with the 1.5 Ecoboost engine, and I find the 2.0 engine powerful and smooth enough for my needs (most importantly it doesn't sound like a whiny 4 cylinder).  I also thought I might want the Revel stereo upgrade, but the bass was so strong that it caused the driver's door to rattle annoyingly, which overrode the improved sound that the system delivered, so no go there.  I also found the multi-contour seats in one model I drove to be less comfortable than the base seats.  I really enjoy the Sync 3 system much more than MyFordTouch, but even though I have the latest version installed (2.0), the system has some bugs.  My car has Apple CarPlay but it requires the phone to be plugged in and I actually prefer the look of the Sync 3 interface anyway.  I disabled CarPlay in the system menu, which allows some apps (like Pandora) to appear on the Sync 3 app menu.  When I press Pandora to play, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  In addition, when I want to play my podcasts, I was not able to use Sync 3 to switch from one downloaded podcast to another, when I tried to play another one it wouldn't work.  Finally, even though I'm (supposedly) connected to my home wifi network, every time I manually check for a Sync 3 update the system just spins and spins, never confirming whether I have the latest version.  While I find the interior quality of the MKZ excellent, I wish I had more color choices to choose from than black or beige.  I really liked the terra-cotta color available in the Reserve models but it can't be had with the Select.  That said the interior quality standards fall short of the Germans.  All of that said, I really enjoy driving this car and all of the other Lincolns I've been in recently.  There are good deals to be had, definitely check them out!

Updates at 8,500 Miles:
Still loving the car for it's quiet and smoothness.  I came out of a Fusion which was an exceptional car, but the MKZ truly takes the experience on another level of luxury.  With the supremely comfortable (base) seats the car is made for relaxing long-distance drives.  I play with the driving modes once in awhile (I push ""S"" when passing"" but I've never bothered to shift manually).

Mileage is about what I expected, mid to high 20's.  Should be better though, I suspect the issues are with the transmission and the weight of the car.  In 6th gear the engine is turning 2,500 rpm which is a little high.  On the freeway I drive 70-79 mph.

I follow some of the MKZ discussion forums and learned how to upgrade Sync 3 to version 3.0.  I did that a couple of weeks ago and the system seems a little less buggy.  I can't figure out how to save my current position as a favorite in the GPS; if there is a way to do it, it's not intuitive.  I'm still using the Sync 3 interface exclusively and have shut off Apple Car Play, even though the Apple Maps are much improved with iOS 11.

Base stereo in the MKZ... unlistenable.  Especially with Sirius radio which is even more so.  Lincoln should follow suit with Lexus and install the XM satellite receivers which sound far better.  The base MKZ stereo is the same as the base Fusion stereo.  At a minimum, Lincoln should install the Sony system from the Fusion Titanium which includes HD ratio.  I wish I had upgraded to the Revel stereo (note for 2018, the MKZ Reserve
 model now includes the Revel stereo as standard... good decision, Lincoln!)

Tires are awful.  I've noted wheelspin and loss of grip on wet roads.

Car has been completely trouble-free for the first 8,500 miles.  Despite my gripes I love the car.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Doug, 06/09/2017,Comfort with great mileage,4,"I moved to the MKZ Hybrid Select after leasing an MKC Reserve, which was nice but had disappointing mileage. The MKZ is quiet, has a smooth, compliant ride and outstanding mileage. I'm averaging around 38 mpg in mostly city driving, but I don't use ECO mode because it makes the car feel too sluggish. Sync 3 is superior to MyLincoln Touch and Android Auto is helpful, but I wish Waze was accessible in the app. The driver's seat feels a little firm, but otherwise the car is very comfortable. The CVT can drone when you mash the pedal, but acceleration is acceptable. I'll be disappointed if Lincoln discontinues the MKZ or doesn't replace it with another hybrid vehicle.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Mrpushrod, 10/25/2016,Should help the Lincoln brand,5,"I test drove many vehicles. When it came down to it I liked the interior, ride and comfort better in the MKZ. And for $55k it is hard to find a creamy smooth 400HP engine. 
The other midsized luxury vehicles felt inferior. As if the Lincoln had a higher-end quality interior. Multicontour seats well thought out, leather and padded surfaces felt soft and supple. It feels like the Lincoln brand is trying harder since they have to thwart off the sport of American brand bashing that is constantly read in publications such as Consumer Reports. Furthermore, I test drove and ordered a MKZ with the Drivers Package that has dynamic torque vectoring which intelligently applies power to the rear wheels when driving aggressively. With the package on a test ride (not pushing to limits) I did not feel any torque steer or that much understeer typically associated with FWD and some AWD vehicles. And to boot in my opinion the road isolation & ride felt better in the Lincoln than a Caddy, Mercedes or BMW. Looking for true compromise, I passed on the summer only tires this time around. So if there is some impact from having AWD vs RWD it will most likely only be noticed at the track or by very aggressive drivers. That said 99.999999% of the audience buying these vehicles today are not going to the race track. They are looking for stable good grip on a variety of road conditions along with easy control and sure footed steering feel. That’s what the average Joe wants behind the wheel and Lincoln delivers. The AWD with torque vectoring does its job and keeps torque steer under control and steering feel is precise; easy to thread the car through a needle. BTW, I am not an ignorant just looking to be the expert and to hear myself speak. I know the difference between the Lincoln and a true sport sedan and opted for the Lincoln. My other vehicles are; a Corvette, Pontiac G8 GT (RWD 6 liter), F150 and Road Glide. The only cons besides the Lincoln name: scant rear head room, smaller rear seat than some, and weight distribution with AWD (not 50-50% front and rear like a RWD sedan). One more comment. Consumer Reports issue with the push button gear selector is really a joke. Anyone that is off the baby bottle will not mind the change. I actually think it makes a lot of sense to free up the console. Hope other brands do the same. A common solution amongst brands through committee would be best

lincoln,mkz,2017,BobH, 11/22/2017,GETTING CLOSER,4,"This marks my 5th MKZ. The first one came about after having owned most of the euros like Mercedes, Jags, BMWs etc.  I was playing golf with a friend from Germany who had been here all of 3 years. When I saw him pull up in a Ford SUV I was shocked since his previous car was a BMW. His comment?  ""Well, I figured since I now live in America, I will support America."" It certainly made me think and after a couple months bought a Lincoln MKZ and never stopped. The first one I had surely was a step down in quality, comfort, bling etc. etc., but with each passing year, I kept noticing continued improvements while the price point stayed within reason. Now, this 2017 is getting closer to luxury but I DO have to point something out about SYNC 3. What HAD BEEN an easy to read TRAFFIC REPORT on Travel Link, is now absolutely ludicrous. It's near impossible to read and some of the listings even have horizontal scroll bar arrows to read the rest of the line. Try doing that while driving and you'll be the NEXT traffic incident. THAT is down right ridiculous.  HOWEVER...improvements have been made with knobs instead of sliders on the dash which makes audio and climate far easier to adjust. Seems too like there's a little more padding for the knees on either side and the interior beige color is better. After having had 4 and now my 5th, I still love things like regular gas, speed filling at the pumps, low brake dust output on wheels, (the euros are the worst for that), still a tad more quieter inside as well. The seats are generally comfortable but could probably be nudged up a click to be perfect. The angle of the NAV screen on the MKZ is nice.......BUT.....because of same, a mid-day sun can make it difficult to see. I could be wrong but it seems like they increased some lumens which helps. Also noticed the touch screen doesn't seem to leave as many fingerprints as it used to.  Finally, I can't say enough about that 4 cyl. Eco-Boost engine. I just wish my Dad were still around because he would be in shock by how smooth, quiet and fast a 4 cyl. could be. In closing, were it not for the inane nuances of the SYNC 3 and especially with Travel Link Traffic display, I'd give it a 4.5 at least. FIX IT LINCOLN....it's ludicrous!

lincoln,mkz,2017,Armand R., 04/28/2019,Leasing now but will buy,5,"I leased the 2017 Lincoln MKZ hybrid Reserve 2 1/2 years ago. I love the car so much I've decided to buy it. I've had a few minor issues with the car that the dealer addressed immediately. The MKZ has had absolutely no major mechanical, electrical, or peripheral issues since I've had it. I love the exterior of the car - and I get a lot of compliments especially on the dramatic new grill. I was considering buying a certified Lexus 300h when my lease was up but the cost of the MKZ is lower, and furthermore, I have been driving the car since it was new.  I love the concierge service that is included with this car. I have never once stepped foot in the dealer's service department! The only complaint is that the back seat has little head and leg room. If you have a tall or big passenger, make sure they sit in the front! All in all, it's a great car!

lincoln,mkz,2017,Cindy W, 06/19/2019,We made the right choice,4,"Update...Very happy with the car.  Nice looking and comfortable.  Have 40,000 miles racked up and been reliable.  Would buy it again.  

Original review:  We bought the car for a comfortable traveling vehicle.  We been stopped and receive comments on how people find the car to be classy or beautiful.  Notice people slowing down to look at the car constantly.  The car is wonderful on long trips.  I really love the car, even if there could be some improvements and plan to own it for any years to come.  We have the Reserve hybrid with all the features offered except massaging seats.  The ride is quiet and smooth.  Appreciate the auto wipers and brights.  Found the adaptive cruise reduces the frustration of slower traffic while picking up speed when cleared.  The blind side is a blessing.  The infotainment system is easy to operate, though the navigation tends to talk a lot and does not hold too many of my previous locations.  Manufacturer should compare and improve navigation similar to Garmin.  Like how updates to navigation is by wifi at no cost.  Pass thru to trunk and fold down sates.  Tight u-turns.  Many option settings when there is a young driver.  With the hybrid, we average over 37 mpg, this was the breaking point to buy the car, not understanding all the other pluses.  The negatives to me is the car is sluggish in eco, but ok without.  Trunk is smaller with battery in back compartment, but good enough for everyday shopping.  Wish there were about 4-5 more inches of legroom in rear for adult passengers, but about average for cars this size.   The panoramic sunroof is a neat idea, but think they should look at the Hyundai panoramic sunroof where it does not cause a problem with rear vision.  These are all minor to us.  We are very pleased with our purchase.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Tedd, 10/07/2017,"Stylish And Efficient, The MKZ Does It All",5,"I ordered the 2017 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Select Plus in Magnetic Gray Metallic with a Cappuccino interior.  Wow.  This car is a real looker inside and out.  The car's already sleek lines accentuate the new-for-2017 front-end.  The little delights like the front LEDs turning on and off in sequence and the large Lincoln logo that projects from the outside mirrors onto the ground just outside the doors as you approach show some serious attention to detail.  The wood trim is real and the grain looks great.  The quality materials of the dash and the swoop of the instrument panel whisper ""luxury."" This car wooshes along serenely and delivers some whopping gas mileage.  Before heading over to the Euro dealers, stop by your local Lincoln dealer.  I never thought I would ever utter such words, but I am smitten.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Juliana G., 09/02/2016,Lemon Alert!!! 2017 Lincoln MKZ Reserve Hybrid,2,"We've had this car 3 months and have brought it back to be serviced 5 times. The car wouldn't start 2 times and needed roadside assistance to jump the battery. The stereo sounds great, but Sirius drops channels frequently even in well populated areas with great satellite visibility. The rear cabin light has a weird flicker/pulsating condition. Every time we bring it to the dealer for service they say they can't duplicate the problem. I took a video of the flickering light and they said that's the way it works. That's the way it works???? A $55,000+ car that has lost charge twice and has a flickering interior light sure sounds like an electrical problem to me. They replaced my new car's battery yesterday, now it's a wait and see game. Other than that, Lincoln said they can't help me.  I've never had such an experience with a new car ....ever. Now, I know why so many people buy foreign cars."

lincoln,mkz,2017,Landon Alberson, 12/29/2017,Goodbye TownCar....Helllo 2017 MKZ,5,"I own the 2017 Lincoln MKZ Reserve with the Technology package.  It retailed for $45,000.  The twin turbo 4 cyl is fast and  I average 25 MPG.  It is black velvet with the optional rims.  The Revel sound system surpasses anything I have ever heard in car audio.  The technology is easy and after 6 months of use, it has worked flawlessly.  If you plug in your phone to the USB port, you never pick it up while driving...the car does everything for you including read and respond to your texts messages and play any song on Apple itunes.  All you do say the title of the song.  I have had a lot of fun going back into the 1980's and 1990's music.  Front seats are very adjustable. It lacks the comfort of the Towncar which I previously owned.   Stirring wheel is telescopic.  Ambient lighting at night is cool- kids especially love it.  When you approach the car at night, it lights up all around and shines the Lincoln welcome mat down on the ground on each side of the car.  Rain sensor and blind spot protection are great!  The cruise is interactive...and I will never go back to regular cruise control.  The pedestrian warning system as activated several times and it makes me feel safe.  People around town stop me so they can look at this beautiful car.  It gets attention.  Real wood trim too and LED lights are beautiful.  And the 2017 MKZ along with the Audi A4 are the quietest cars on the road this year.  It has noise cancellation system...so very quiet even at 80MPH.  I got the Terracotta seats and they really stand out against the black trim and enhance the walnut wood trim. Im at 42,000 miles.  It has only had oil changes and one alignment and new tires.

There really is not much competition, just as there hadn't been for the earlier car. If you want an entry-level luxury hybrid sedan, your choice is limited to the Lexus LS, Toyota Avalon, and the Lincoln. (A Ford Fusion Titanium is another option, but it's a clone of the Lincoln, not appreciably less expensive, and lacks a few features and free loaners during service.) In my mind, both the design and performance of the first two are lacking. My experience dealing with Lincoln service had been excellent, and I like that the car is manufactured in North America (albeit Mexico, not the USA). So I stuck with Lincoln. As with the earlier car, I enjoy driving the newer car very much. The Sync 3 system is superior to the earlier My Lincoln Touch (although I had no problems with it either). The Reserve trim now includes automatic folding mirrors, but lacks a heated steering wheel. It also offers an ECO option, which provides more regenerative braking when your foot is off the gas, but I find the car feels a bit sluggish if it is engaged. The car has outstanding technology, is supremely comfortable, handles well, and consistently gets 36 mpg on what are generally very short trips in heavy traffic, and over 40 mpg on longer highway trips. It's not Prius territory, but good enough for me. My chief gripe with both cars is the course quality of the gasoline engine. It's not noticeable except when heavy acceleration is required. To the car's credit, it will move out pretty quickly, but the noise and coarseness intrude on what is an otherwise quiet and refined vehicle. Other than that, I have no complaints at all. I highly recommend buying certified used. It's like having a new car with a four-year warranty, but letting the first owner (or, more likely, lease holder) take the brunt of depreciation.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Richard of Yardley, 07/27/2017,400 HP with AWD - How bad can it be?,5,"This car is the 3.0t AWD Version, and is Diamond Black, has the driver's, technology, and climate packages. Also included are the panoramic sunroof, massage seats and the $1,080 stereo system.  With a MSRP total well above $56,000, I was a bit reluctant to make the move.  Bought it anyway.  A perfectly amazing ""Hot Rod Lincoln"".  0-60 = 4.6 seconds.  Back in the day (early to mid-fifties), Lincoln ruled the stock car racing circuit; today, this car would be a major contender.  It is an amazing set of wheels.  Very quiet and peppy in ""D"", but just roars in ""S"".  Value for money is exceptional.  Out does many BMW's, Audis, and Mercedes in performance, and certainly price.  All things considered, this car is very much worthy of your consideration.  Performance is unparalleled!
July 2018:  It just gets better! - Further on my initial review and update:  I failed to mention that the OEM Michelin tires are awful!  Totally inadequate for the car's power and sophisticated technology.  I switched to Perelli P-Zero summer tires (slightly up-sized to 255/40R19 100V XL), and the change is remarkable; no wheel spin, and much less torque steer.  I use Perelli winter Sottozero 3 between October - March.  I chose the P-Zeros because my 2015 Mustang was delivered with them, and they are outstanding albeit expensive.  If you have the 3.0 AWD, its well worth the money to upgrade your tires!  ...and if you live where it snows, winter tires are a huge plus.
January 2019:  Continue to be very pleased with this large ""mid-size"" sedan.  It is comfortable and handles extremely competently.  Mileage has improved to  20 mpg from 18.  Routine maintenance is the only cost incurred to date.  No warranty work has been required.
August 2019: No change. The car was very competent in last winter's inclement weather.
January 2020: Nothing new to report.  No major technological advances to prompt anything new at this time.  Appearance still turns heads!
August 2020: A keeper; bought an extended warranty from Ford Motor Co.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Todd, 03/15/2018,Cool sophistication,5,"I have the hybrid reserve model. The Revel audio system, leather seats, and technology features at a price that’s thousands less than the German competitors makes me love this car even more. The hybrid model is not fast; but it’s not supposed to be. I live in a metropolitan area and had a sports car previously. How fast can you really go? I’m loving the air conditioned luxury seats, advanced safety features, and 42mpg (in a car that doesn’t look like a Prius). If you want a sports sedan, this may not be for you. If you want an “eco” friendly car that doesn’t scream “eco”, and provides you with all the modern creature comforts one could want, this may be the car for you.

lincoln,mkz,2017,davidspro, 05/23/2019,My 2nd MKZ hybrid and it's trouble-free and a joy,5,"This is my second MKZ, my first, a 2014, had one very minor issue during my 36 month lease. This 2017 car has been trouble free 24 months into the lease.  I loaded this up with pretty much every available option, except for the huge moon roof.  I find that I am getting slightly lower mileage (35 - 38 mpg) than my much more modestly equipped  2014, which averaged about 38 - 40 mpg.  That, of course, is when driving it like a normal car.   On those days when I'm feeling up to maximizing the energy recapture through braking, I can squeeze 45 to 50 or more, depending upon the terrain.   The car is not a performance beast, but is a pleasure to drive on long trips.  The adaptable cruise control, lane maintenance, adaptable high beams, etc. save a lot of wear and tear on my feet.  I like the design and the ""Batman"" style Lincoln logo that lights up on the ground at night.  If this car holds up well over the last 12 months of the lease, I will probably buy it.

lincoln,mkz,2017,Jewopaho, 04/24/2017,A Real Sleeper!,5,"Smooth, very quiet ride, responsive handling, exceptionally comfortable seating, safety features galore, loads of creature comforts ... a huge bang for the buck.  It's an outstanding value in the entry-level luxury car field as it stands... but I purchased a dealer's service loaner with a few thousand miles on it, saving a nice chunk of change. It looks, performs and even smells like a new car.  To top it off, the 2.0 turbo runs on regular gas!  There's also the bonus of owning a vehicle made in the US by union labor.  If there's any drawback, it could use a bit more power when accelerating, but it's hardly a concern, given all the positives.  As a previous owner of foreign luxury vehicles, I'm glad I made the decision I did.   UPDATE: Six months' ownership, and nothing has changed ... great car.  The infotainment system is outstanding and very user-friendly, especially the navigation. Living in Texas, with its triple-digit summers, the air-conditioned (not just ventilated) seats are a blessing ... and not even available on much of the competition.  Generally speaking, you'd have to shell out another ten grand to own a similar vehicle ... and just about all other 2.0 turbos require premium fuel.  Yep, this one's definitely a keeper.

lincoln,mkz,2017,CoalKing, 02/09/2019,What a disaster!,1,"Not sure who has failed more - Lincoln or the dealer. The car is a mess - a myriad of rattles, knocks, sluggish performance, and scary electrical problems (eg, the car will sometimes not recognize the key/the dashboard will go black and visibly “reboot”/the radio will start to play on its own/etc). The dealer plays the “unless it happens while I’m looking at it, we won’t try to find and fix it.” Video evidence doesn’t count. After completing an unsolicited opinion survey from Lincoln, the dealer took offense and refuses to service the vehicle. Called Lincoln, their response was “sucks to be you....the dealers are independent, they can do what they want.” Purchasing this vehicle is one of the worst decisions I’ve ever made. We are thrilled with a 2014 MKX that we own, but will never buy Lincoln again.

lincoln,mkz,2017,MKD, 01/01/2018,My second MKZ,5,"This is a great car, my second one. The first being a 2015. While some people don't like the push button shifters, I think that not only is it unique, it frees up space in the center console providing a smooth flow of the controls. Gone are the confusing touch-sliders from 2015. While still powerful, the 2015 engine seemed to run and shift smoother. And I especially like the Lincoln Experience.  Overall, Lincoln has another winner. Highly recommended!

lincoln,mkz,2017,John Arras, 01/03/2018,A Lot of Car For The $$$,4,"I am totally enjoying getting 40MPG's and still able to drive a true luxury car!  I get a lot of looks and questions, all good! I have the White Platinum paint with the all dark glass roof and the upgraded pocket wheels. Very hot looking!  Love all luxury the features and appointments. The massaging seats are really cool and nice on long drives.  Downsides are that the voice recognition does not recognize about half of my address book which is very frustrating when driving and wish that worked better. Also the sound system is just ""OK"". I expected to be ""Wowed"" by a great sound system but it is not to be. Our other car is a Kia Soul and its sound system is much better!  That said, we are very happy with our MKZ overall and feel it is a sharp well built machine. Also very good value for all you get. We hope Lincoln will improve on the few shortfalls mentioned as we feel we would most likely buy another MKZ in the future! A little more head and leg room would be nice too. If Lincoln would make the Continental in a Hybrid, I would buy one!

lincoln,mkz,2017,Scott in Wesern PA, 03/14/2017,I was Prepared To Be Amazed But I Was Bamboozled,2,"To be fair, I was comparing this to the Mercedes E350, Cadillac CTS4, Audi A6 and a BMW 5 series. In my subjective testing of 15-30 minute test drives, each of these cars led or tied a category...The Lincoln was never a serious contender in any category. Cheap interior materials. A $1000+ top-of-the-line sound system that you swear is old fashioned boomboxes stuffed into the door panels. Significant squat upon moderate braking. Confidence un-inspiring body roll in curves. Over-boosted steering. At least they finally got the exterior styling correct as the new grill is beautiful. Significant road noise, could be the tires. I so wanted to like this car, and kept telling myself it stickered $15-$25,000 less than the others, but even at that price point I wouldn't pull the trigger as there are many other options in that price range that offer an engaging driving experience.

It is the MKZ in a much less prestigious Ford body.  Writing this review as the pluses and minuses are identical to the MKZ.  Entering third year of ownership.  Window bounceback issue fixed quickly.  No other issues.

Parking assist gets me within about 6 inches from the curb every time. An older driver, I have neck problems and it is a lifesaver.  AWD with 19 inch low profile tires hold slippery roads perfectly.   Adaptive cruise control is a great safety feature. 

Plush leather interior with walnut trim.  The Fusion Platinum biggest engine is the standard 2.0 turbo.  The 400 HP must be nice."

lincoln,mkz,2018,Tommy, 09/22/2018,Serene Cruiser with sporting ambitions,4,"I owned a 2017 Mazda 6 touring . With it's 19 inch wheels and dialed in suspension , it handled great . It was however , a little harsh in ride quality and higher in noise than I wanted as well as being a little underpowered. I went to my local lincoln / Mazda dealer to drive the 2018 Mazda 6 with the turbo and the signature package trim . The sales guy suggested that if I was going to spend that much that I might want to check out the MKZ. I did ..and well, it was all over. I loved the way the MKZ drove and before I knew it , I was deciding between a white select package with cappuccino interior and the one I decided upon, the black velvet on ebony premiere with the magnetic package including a darker grill and 19"" inch wheels . My car is the base MKZ with just this package as it's only option . With the incentive from dealer as well as all ncoln , I paid a little over 33k . For this price I don't believe the car can be beat in terms of value . When you walk up to the car the welcome lighting comes on in sequance and projects the Lincoln logo onto the ground  by both the drivers  and the front passenger door. Sit inside on the comfortable power seats with power lumbar and hit the start button. The start up is refined. I'm used to the Mazda and this thing is just quiet and elegant on start up . The LCD dash comes to life , your seating goes to its pre programmed place . Press the drive button on the dash and start your trip. The MKZ accelerates quickly and smoothly through the gears . Unless you are looking to drag race then this car has all the power you need with the 2.0 liter turbo in my opinion. The base  lincoln premium sound stereo is not quite as good as the Bose in my Mazda but it's close. It's way better than some of the reviews here would have you believe. The black interior with the aluminum trim is very high tech looking to me. True , there are other cars in its class that have a more luxurious appearance but there are many little things here that denote luxury. From the auto hold braking, to the lighted door sills with Lincoln spelled out , the auto up and down feature on all 4 windows, remote start, back up sensors , soft touch materials on  just about all surfaces, laminated glass, adaptive suspension and headlights that turn with your steering inputs, the trunk that sinches shut wh n you gently lower the lid and most of a all a truly , serene and quit ride . The Lincoln MKZ Is a bargain . Select sport mode and thrown it into an on ramp. It's holds the curve nearly as well as the Mazda while keeping much more composed. The climate control is good . The Lincoln app is just cool. Want to have you car start up on it's pre programmed time and read the ambient temp in order to determine to turn in the heated seats or the AC .I think it's possible to take it up over 50k and once you really get much past 45k there are alternative luxuaty cars with even more refinement and luxury but for the deal you can get on these  thngs I don't think there is anything that can touch it for value.

lincoln,mkz,2018,Keith Hawkins, 03/13/2019,BE VERY CAREFUL OF LINCOLN,2,"I bought my brand new Lincoln off the showroom floor in March of 2018.  I was super excited as I loved the way the way the new Lincolns look and the fact that they were fast and handled great.  Once I had an opportunity to drive it and use the features I could not have been happier with my purchase.  Around 2500 miles in I noticed a loud grinding noise coming from my right passenger side wheel when making left turns.  I immediately called the dealer and they advised me to continue driving (as long as I felt safe) and bring it in during the 5000 mile service interval.  I did that, and right before I brought in the air conditioner was making a very loud noise as well when you switch gears and come to an idle.  I made both of these known to dealer and they said they would take a look at it.  I got the car back a few days later and notice the same two noises were still occurring.  Make a long story short from May 2018 to October 2018 I left my car with the dealership to fix 7 times and each time, the service dept would say they've fixed my issue only to drive a week or two and realize the noises were still present.  After numerous calls with Ford (corporate) the GM of the dealership, I applied for the buyback program due to the care being a Lemon, and to me, unfixable.  Once I completed my case with Ford (corporate) I was approved for a buyback.  I loved my car so much that during the buyback process, I told my original salesperson to find me another car exactly like the one I had...Down to the color.  Now mind you that everyone at the local dealership had been pretty pleasant, accommodating, and apologetic up to this point.  I didn't blame anyone for anything, but just wanted to have the new car feel and most of all just wanted what I paid for.  HERE'S WHERE IT TURNS REALLY UGLY.....During the buyback process Ford (Corporate) in Dearborn Michigan sent me a worksheet that shows what they were going to buy the car back for.  On this worksheet, they only offered me a refund of $2200.  However, I paid over $8k in less than 10 months in an attempt to pay the car off quickly.  When I called my caseworker she then transferred to a superior name ""Angie"" who has to the be the most unprofessional ""customer"" service person I have ever talked to.  As a business owner, she would never get the opportunity to speak to customer in the way she spoke to me.  Through all the yelling and screaming at me, she made it seem as if it were my fault I bought a lemon, that lemon buyback amounts are regulated by state laws, and that I should be lucky they are even considering a buyback.  State laws regulate lemon buyback criteria but DO NOT create hare-brained formulas to screw people out of money.  So after about 5 minutes on the phone with her I said to her ""I have a down payment on the exact car"" do you not care to keep me as a customer because this is ridiculous.  Her response verbatim ""I DON'T CARE IF YOU TAKE THE DEAL OR NOT, I DONT CARE IF YOU DONT BUY ANOTHER LINCOLN...TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.""  To me, that was a punch in the gut, because through all of this I really wanted another Lincoln, but I will not be talked to like this.  I got screwed, took the deal, and cancelled the order of my newer Lincoln.  The dealership was upset, but understood.  I now have an Infiniti and overall the whole process was the more professional, the car is great, service is great and I will never buy another Lincoln....Buyer Beware!

lincoln,mkz,2018,Richard Russ, 04/26/2019,Hadn't conidered a MKZ until I drove one,5,"I have owned many cars in my life from normal everyday drivers to the top of the line luxury models from GM, Lincoln and Jaguar. I always thought that Jaguar had the best ride and comfort. My last car was a new Buick LaCrosse Premium which I bought last year based on what I had heard about how it drove and how quiet it was. It was nice but not what I would say luxurious regarding the ride which was rather harsh and not nearly as quiet as I had hoped for. Then one day my wife saw a new MKZ up close. She said she liked the looks of it and wondered why we hadn't considered one of those. My answer was I don't know! I loved the new looks of the Lincoln which reminded me of a Bentley. It is embarrassing to admit, but in the 45 years of marriage we have owned over 50 cars. I can honestly say of all the cars we have owned I don't think I have ever driven a car that was more pleasing than the new MKZ. With the new sound deadening technology inside the car and the comfort of the seats as well as the ride I have never owned a finer car. It is truly a pleasure to drive. It is rare when you can drive a car that it is as quiet and comfortable as sitting in your own living room. If you are thinking about a new car, you would be amiss if you don't drive a 2018 or later Lincoln MKZ.

lincoln,mkz,2018,Russell, 01/03/2019,Best value and reliability,5,"I’ve owned my MKZ for two years now still running great. Thus far no issues and very comfortable on the road. Good value and sharp car

Purchased a 2018 MKZ Reserve 2.0 AWD in Oct 2018 as I needed a new car and wanted a stylish vehicle this go around. At first very hesitant on the 2.0 liter engine but after purchasing the car the engine does not disappoint.  Great ride nice interior and all the technology one could want in a luxury car. Front seats stiff at first but break in rather nicely. Good on long road trips and no fatigue. I recommend this car to anyone looking for luxury at a great price.

Our 2011 had 113k miles and was going strong. We simply got the bug to get a new one. We found Ruby (she is Ruby Red) and we fell in love. The updated features are always nice to have and we have not been disappointed. I doubt that we will ever purchase anything other than a Lincoln MKZ or upgrade in the future.

lincoln,mkz,2019,Red Ryder, 04/14/2019,Loving my THIRD MKZ hybrid,5,"I am currently leasing a 2019 MKZ hybrid. This is my third.  I leased a 2011, bought a 2014 and now have the 2019 Reserve I with sun roof and special wheel rims. I am a big fan of this car. The 2019 has far better acceleration than the other two, which helps on the highway. When I drive local roads, my MPG goes above 40; stays around 36 with constant highway driving. The car is very comfortable for me, as was the first one I ever test drove. I am 5’2” and this car is made for smaller people. My 5’10” husband does not find it as comfortable as I do.  The technology is improved quite a bit and it’s easier to make vocal commands. There are several way to control things - the steering wheel, the computer screen or the buttons on the console. I enjoy the solid, quiet ride it offers, as well as the good audio.  I love this car and will continue to buy or lease it since I want a hybrid and this one, to me, is the best one out there. Yes, you lose trunk space but that’s a small sacrifice.

lincoln,mkz,2019,Vaughn Watts, 12/30/2018,Reserve I Plus Package,5,"Gives enough optional performance setting including comfort options to meet most driving needs.  This 4 2.0T engine is NOT my Grande Sport performance but didn’t buy it for that. Turn on driving aids, set comfort / performance setting for DRIVE and SPORT modes, and view the teaching videos-you will learn how to use the advanced options to tune your driving experience. Quality of sound system is surprising but again set your options for your taste.  Voice and Manual Nav needs some improvements-clumsy at times showing new software needing more human interaction quality testing-but usable and nice.  I expect a Software update on this as models are sold and feedback given.  Overall a great car for entire family and enjoyment on a trip or just out to a dinner show.

lincoln,mkz,2019,Dustin, 01/17/2019,Great value MKZ,5,"I drove several hybrids before deciding on MKZ.  Best price,best interior by far,handles well never expected it to be as quick as it has turned out to be, not turbocharged performance, but good for a hybrid.  We like it wanted to try a hybrid and so far so good.  I'll drive my Crossfire SRT when I want to blow doors off other cars, this is for trips and travel.  Have owned it now for over a year and would buy again if I needed another car.

lincoln,mkz,2019,Len M., 08/12/2019,Driven Lincolns 30 plus years-MKZ is exceptional,5,"I just bought my first Hybrid.  I have two MKZ's and have for a couple of years.  Both of my others had the 3.0 ltr. 400 HP engine.  They are a joy to drive.  However, it is past time to try to help with the environment.  Thought about an electric car-but the limitations on distance and recharging time dissuaded me at this point.  I test drove the MKZ Hybrid and I was immediately sold.  Great ride and enough power to get you out of the way.  I highly recommend."
lincoln,mkz,2019,Oscar Cos, 03/03/2020,The best value for the money,5,"I drove everything on the market around the price and ended up purchasing the 2019 MKZ 2.0 turbo. Real leather seats, not plastic with a fancy name such as ""artic leather"". Real wood and aluminum used on console and dashboard. Nicest audio system. Good looking 19"" rims, not 18 or 17"" rims. One of the best things is that it included weather tech like mats but with lincoln design on them. I have 5,000 miles on it and very happy with my purchase.

Lincoln drove better,for our needs, and controls were easier to use along with cost being lower.Purchased in December  and are more than satisfied, it is not a ""hot rod"" we also own a sports car...it is a great trip car and always is above the 40mpg figure so far. Wife is short and seating position and view out the front was best for her of any car we tried.

"
lincoln,mkz,2019,Magician, 08/28/2019,Magical Drive,5,"Magical Drive.
I've purchased 2019 Lincoln MKZ 2.OL, FWD with Reserve II package.
The car is a dream to drive. Engine is powerful, transmission is smooth, suspension is composed, interior is gorgeous, infotainment system is intuitive and very easy to use. Revel 14 speaker audio system is OK, but nothing to brag about. It certainly can't be compared with Bang & Olufsen nor Bose from Audi. The trunk is really big. Seats are very comfortable and the massage function is an awesome feature. It massages your back and your bottom. The fuel economy is great for such a car. I am getting 34-35 MPG on highway on regular gasoline. I did not notice much of a difference in performance using Premium fuel.
In my opinion, the only shortcoming are the headlights. Standard HID headlights are quite dim, yellowish and do not project far enough. It is really yesterday's technology. You can get a full LED headlights, but be prepared to pay for not so useful and expensive luxury package, which consists of panoramic roof, full LED headlights and 21 speaker Revel audio system. I did not notice a tremendous difference between this 21 speaker system and standard 14 speaker Revel system. Which for me personally was rather useless and not justifiable to pay such a high premium for LED headlights. They should be standard on the top trim. Even much less expensive cars have LED headlights standard.
It is also hard to find a car with the luxury package and if you want a specific color and powertrain combination, you might need to order it from the factory.
So, the bottom line it is a great car and with all the incentives Lincoln is giving it makes it a win.
Take a test drive and see for yourself.

Took link to Missouri and the awd and 3.0t had no difficulty with hilly terrain and with sport mode staying in lower gearing it helped downhill as well along with brake hold that was awesome in traffic on hills. I also own a Buick lacrosse 3.6 and love my Buick but it is no comparison to the mkz. Awesome luxury sleeper!

lincoln,mkz,2019,Tim, 10/17/2019,Exceeds Expectations,5,"I debated a long time before ordering my 2019 MKZ Reserve II AWD 3.0tt.  This car delivers an awesome price / performance point with 400hp and a smooth plush ride.  My wife has a 2018 Cadillac CTS AWD 2.0t and my MKZ blows it away in performance, ride and comfort, with a sticker price about $7K less.  I highly recommend you give this car a look.

Update: After 2 years with the MKZ I am even more impressed with it. In addition to the performance and excellent ride my vehicle has had exactly 0 warranty issues.  I actually like the MKZ more than my old 2006 STS-V.  The V was faster, but was in the shop all the time, not to mention the V was close to twice the price.

lincoln,mkz,2019,Dr. W, 07/03/2020,Brand new 2019 Hybrid Reserve II!!!,5,"I already loved my 2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid Titanium. However, Rez, the new kid, is amazing.  I was upside down so I HAD to go new. 

Love the interior, though I wish mine wasnt black. I do wish the back seat and truck were a little bigger.  It seems about 1/2 "" smaller than the Fusion Hybrid. I extra love the floor mats. I drive A LOT and wish no shoes or socks. lol

I also love the exterior.  Its creases and edges ensure it stands out.  The other luxury cars seem to all have been molded with the same basic curves.

Mechanically, I do wish for a LITTLE more power, as the MKZ is about 200 lbs heavier than the Fusion Hybrid Titanium. I can tell.  That weight plus sport driving mode lowered the gas mileage from 45-50 mpg to 42-45 because Rona has me limited to my neighborhood and local county by 15 miles or so.

Interior with the panoramic sunroof... the stop and go cruise are flawless.  the lane departure works well, and I love the BLIS, which I had on my 2012 Fusion SEL but not the 2017 Fusion Hybrid Titanium.  Revel sound system is PHENOMENAL!!!  OMG!!!  Yes, the XM does go out easy. I think its because its at truck level instead of roof level.

Black finish seems to be a lot vulnerable to smudges, but the car looks great.  Dealer added an unlimited powertrain warranty at no charge.  Its only my 2nd brand new car.  I plan on driving it until the wheels fall off. Lincoln reliablity is FAR above average.  Like its Fusion mate, very limited recalls. Speaking of wheels, I am unsure WHY the car no longer comes with run-flat tires.

I love the auto high-beams, although they get on my nerves sometimes. lol. cooled seats and even the massaging seats are cool.  Its not the same system in a $80-85k car, but its kool.  I only paid $35k.  Got a great finance deal with Ally from the dealer too.

Update Sept 2020... So I tried the parking feature. It works well.  I did have an issue where the panoramic sunroof track was blocked.  At dealer for two weeks.  Gave me a non-hybrid MKZ.  i still prefer mine.  I love the way the heated seats warm ALL the way up the back like a real luxury car.  Wish the cooled seats did the same. 

I test drove the Accord Hybrid Touring.  It is a larger vehicle inside AND out.  However, I HATED the eco-leather seats.  I love the idea of recycled material, but I'm after luxury.  The land departure, emergency braking, and other safety features were TOO overbearing.  The Lincoln offers a good balance in the default settings. Also, the Accord was LOUD!!  Yes, the display looked great.  If you have a HUGE family, which I dont, the Accord may fit better with more interior and trunk space.  I love the better look of the Lincoln. Its Sexy and well worth the $5k price increase, though the MKZ's are on sale.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Dissatisfied Customer, 09/09/2019,Major transmission issues,1,"Do not buy Lincoln.  Purchased in July 2019.  The 2019 Lincoln Nautilus has major transmission issues, harsh shifting, clunking.  Lincoln claims that they are working on a fix but this has been a known issue since before March 2019.  Here it is September 2019 with no progress!!  The 1 star rating is for how nice the vehicle looks.  How can Lincoln claim to be a 'luxury' car if they knowingly release and allow dealers to sell poor quality cars?  Should of stuck with Acura.  Don't think the Model drop down list below is complete, choosing one since it's required.  My vehicle has  2.7L Twin-turbo V6 engine. "

Electrical issues from mirrors folding in, blower fan not working, screen issues to now a blown motor after 10 months of ownership.  Been in the shop continuously since I have owned this car and could not be any sicker than I am now with my purchase.  My family has been a Lincoln owner(Mom has MKX and daughter has MKC) however my experience with the 2019 Nautilus has pushed me to consider another make when the one I own is currently fixed.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Disappointed Customer, 08/27/2019,😪 2019 Lincoln Nautilus Reserve 6 cylinder turbot,2,"I suggest you steer clear of the Nautilus. Took possession in Dec 2018 of my 2019 Nautilus. Loaded vehicle 6 cyl turbo Reserve all the bells and whistles. I’m afraid to take it out of town. Trouble with the transmission, trouble with the brakes and there is a loud metal scraping, clanging sound from under the middle of the car when I open any of the doors. The dealership can’t seem to fix anything and they look at me like I’m crazy. Had an MKX and loved it so made a huge mistake of ordering a new model the first year of release. 
I don’t know what I’m going to do but won’t continue to drive this car as I have serious concerns of being stranded on the highway somewhere.
Please be very careful before buying this vehicle. Check the complaints coming in on CarComplaints.com. I’m not alone in my disappointment.

Purchased a Nautilus Reserve V6 a month ago. With the adaptive suspension, the Nautilus is by far the most comfortable and luxurious ride I have ever owned. It has a tighter normal and sport ride mode, but I am addicted to the smooth marshmallow feel of the comfort mode. The vehicle is extremely quiet, even better than my Continental.  Love the wireless charging pad, so convenient. The 3D camera gives you total access views around the vehicle. The V6 engine gives me a ton of power when I need it. Gas mileage averaging 25 with a lot of city driving. Adaptive headlights are very good as they move with the turning of the car. The tweaks in exterior from MKX to Nautilus are spot on. Very pleased with this purchase.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Patti Fisher, 02/06/2020,Nautilus Disaster,1,"I had my new 2019 Nautilus less than a month when the transmission went out.  Then it was in the shop for 47 days.  Since then there have been constant problems with rough shifting, auto hold, sensor alarms, crazy messages on the dash, and being unable to enter the car.  Lincoln rushed this model to the market.  After the new transmission was installed in my car, it continued to have problems.  I had to wait 2 months for a software update.  I am now afraid to drive the car.  With sensor alarms going off as I'm driving down the street, I never know what crazy thing it's going to do next.  Of course Lincoln and the dealer, Bill Knight Lincoln of Tulsa are refusing to repurchase my vehicle.  I get a new Lincoln every 2-3 years, but after this fiasco I'm leaving the brand.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Bob Gidden, 02/21/2019,Warning re Phone Charging,4,"I have a Lincoln Nautilus and it has some problems.

1 DANGER WARNING
The wireless charging system has no cut off. I purchased a new LG L6 phone specifically because it offers wireless charging. After about a 2 hour drive the alarm on the phone went off indicating a high temperature. And wow was it ever hot. If we did not have the door to the pocket open we would never have noticed and perhaps the LiOn battery would have exploded. 
The pocket is unusable if the phone is on the charger. The glass is facing up and nothing should be put on it.
This was not thought out too well by the designers.

2 It rides like a pick up truck. This is my 3rd Lincoln. First two were MKX.
The dealer has balanced the tires twice and rotated them. No help. 
The tires are 245/40R20 Continental made in Portugal. 
The web site lists them as a type of sport tire. 
Why are they on a large luxury car? 
I have over 4,000 miles on it now.
There are 3 ride settings but they make no difference.

3 The windshield has been sloped down and back. This makes it difficult for a large person to enter the front seats. My passenger is 6 foot 2 and if the seat is forward at all he cannot get in the car. He must put the seat back and down to get in. 
I have hit myself on the door while getting out. Hard on my nose   LOL
This is a design flaw but we can live with it.

Beyond that I love all the buttons, displays, options, radio, etc. 
I was skeptical about the 4 cylinder engine but with the 8 speed transmission and turbo it is great. Hard to tell what gear you are it due to the smooth shifting. 

I would like to hear if you plan another review after other people have driven it for a while.

Improvements made in every little area you can think of.  The ride alone is so much better, it is like riding a car like ride now in Comfort Mode.  The Dashboard I Just Love Everything about and just learning still.  I like the wireless charging system too.  The car is a lot quieter too and a lot more sound insulation, you can tell.  The side laminated windows do wonders to suppress the wind noise.  I like having WiFi in the car too, I did not have before.  The safety features have gotten a lot better too.  With evasive steering and lane centering with the adaptive cruise control is impressive, among other items.  The Revel Ultima The Sound System is one of the Best I ever Heard.  My music sounds new again through the Revel Ultima’s 19 speakers.  I did the Black Label Edition this time and Love all the services that come with it.  I think it was really worth the price difference. Besides the car itself is just Gorgeous!!  I never got so many people stopping me and asking me what kind of car it is and telling me How Much They Love the Nautilus!!

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Lumpy , 05/09/2019,Porsche Cayenne’s “ Nemesis “?,4,"I think so!!!!  As a former Cayenne S owner, I guess I’d have to say, the Nautilus is a more than viable contender.....in some areas it surpasses the Cayenne....and I loved my Cayenne!  Comfort.....there should be no doubt...the Nautilus wins, hands down!  I have to be absolutely honest up front though, ........they are two distinctly different critters!  The Cayenne is a sports car in disguise, and the Nautilus is a Continental in disguise!!  If I’m prowling mountain roads, in search of BMW X-5’s ( my favorite prey BTW), I want the Cayenne V8, and the adjustable suspension!  However, if I’m taking my bride, or significant other, to the honeymoon hideaway in the Rockies and I want to smother her/him with comfort, and assure her/him I’m the MAN, the Nautilus is going to get the nod!  As I said.....two different critters, with two distinct identities!  Both of which in some form or fashion, attempt to somewhat be the other!  And to a degree , they both pull it off!  Well done Porsche.......Touché Nautilus!!
    I want to point out something else.....the trim selections that this edmunds site auto offers,  do not include the Reserve Twin-turbo V-6.....that’s a shame, as that’s the one that really throws out the gauntlet.....choose your options carefully when buying or leasing.....the twin turbo is a kick to drive!!!

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Walter, 10/07/2019,Underrated Crossover,5,"I cross shopped the Lincoln Nautilus with Audi, BMW, and Land Rover.  Ultimately, the Lincoln had more standard features, more power (especially in the 2.7 twin turbo I opted for), and came in at a better price.  And frankly, I don't see as many of them on the road as the German counterparts - I'd rather not be a lemming.  Perhaps the only things I wish came standard, especially at the higher tier, are adaptive cruise and a front camera.  Not deal breakers, but I wasn't willing to pay for $1500 for the package to get them.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Disappointed, 03/27/2019,One Year Update,4,"This is actually the 2.7 GTDI model, but there was no choice to select this model.  Within a few mile of new the transmission slipped a great deal when trying to shift between 3rd and 4th gears.    Dealer found the problem to be in the transmission control software and fixed the problem.  However, at about 8,000 mile it reoccurred, but not as bad as before.  The transmission jerked and made a loud noise when shifted into drive or reverse.  No noticeable pattern to the problem.  Same fix as before the transmission control software was updated and it fixed the problem.

The vehicle is for the most part a pleasure to drive, but for the price I'm just not sure if I would purchase another.  The vehicle currently has 16,000 miles.

Lincoln brags that they will give you a loaner when your car goes in for service.  Not so with the dealer that services this vehicle.

Couple of more things.... when you drive it in the rain there is a loud water running sound in the roof.  Most like the drain.  It can get on your nerves.  At night there is a red light strip just above the back up camera that makes it hard to use the camera.

I’m a 2x Volvo owner and 2x Lexus owner but this time out, I wanted to give an American made vehicle a fair shot.  By far(really not close at all), the Lincoln’s STANDARD tech package far outdistanced it’s competition.  In my case, the competition was a Lexus, audi, infinity and Acura - all comparable vehicles.  Here were the four features that either weren’t available or needed an additional package in the nonlincoln vehicles and all were standard in the Nautilus - Remote starter(integrated and included), rear heated seats, TOUCHscreen nav system, FREE mobile app, wireless charger.  The one item which i did have in my Lexus and isn’t available in the Nautilus is for the side review mirrors to adjust when the car is placed in reverse - i didn’t realize until after purchase that the mirrors didn’t adjust - i’m Surprised since this vehicle has absolutely EVERYTHING else.  It’s not a deal breaker for me but just a bit odd.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Atlanta girl, 03/22/2019,Beauty in Iced Mocha,4,"I leased this car and after my first week with it I am having a few questions of WHAT HAVE I DONE!  I gave us a Nissan Murano Platium after three years and 22,300 miles with all the bells and whistles on it.  I truly wanted what I had with this car plus a bit more.  I paid $51,000 and there is no front camera or the other safety features they all talk about.  These must have been in the most expensive package that I did not get as I felt front camera should have been standard.  Getting kicked again for assuming.  The engine shutting off once you are stopped for any time is a pain in the rear.  I have to remember to shut it off each time I start  the car.  Also still not wild about not having a gear shift.  But the sound systems is brilliant and love hooking my phone in and using my apps in the car. Getting into the car may be hard for a taller person than I am at 5’3” as the seat position doesn’t give you much room and one must  duck their head to get into the car.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Ray D., 12/03/2019,Lincoln Nautilus: Worst new car among 25 I’ve had,1,"2.7 L, AWD, Reserve
1. Extremely retarded engine timing: Been back to Sesi Lincoln many times, but no fix. When I step on the accelerator, no response, then it surges. The transmission slams to engage. Very hard to finese your stop and go drive. Unsafe, hard to control.
2. Navigation is completely unreliable. Erroneous directions, compared to Google maps. It generates totally unknown addresses as “destination”. It has led me astray many times. Sesi has tried to fix but still bad.
3. Vibrations at highway speeds: The dealer, Sesi, tried to tell me “It’s within spec.” I downloaded a vibration analyzer on my cell phone and showed them how BAD it is. Finally, they replaced the tires. Vibration gone.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Wayne G., 08/14/2019,The perfect match,5,"Have had our Reserve 2.7L AWD for six weeks; it has all the options except the Ultimate and Lincoln Play.  We just returned from a 500-mile trip to western Colo. and back across the continental divide (10,000'+ mt. passes).  We towed a boat trailer (just over 3000 lb.) and had our luggage and two E-bikes in back.  You can drive up the mountain at any (safe) speed you choose even with the load; it has the power.  This is perhaps the quietest vehicle we have had; our other two vehicles are a Jag XF and an Alfa Romeo Giulia (which replaced an Audi and a BMW respectively).  We used the massaging 22-way seats on our highway trip; they really work.  The backup camera allows me to position our receiver hitch right at the trailer ball when hooking up the trailer.  I love all the safety features; they keep you informed without intruding.  We drove our first 1000 miles around our home area, suburban driving, getting about 20-21 MPG.  We are very pleased with our purchase.  Everything appears to be functioning flawlessly. 

Update:  Now at 14 months, we continue to be exceptionally pleased with the Nautilus.  We recently completed  a 3000-mile trip carrying our e-bikes on a receiver bike rack.  We had a chance to use the cruise control which would control not only speed, but steer the car around curves (but not let you take your hands off the wheel) and also manage braking when needed.  We love the car.  That 2.7 engine has all the power you need.  We were running on highways with 80 mph speed limits; even at that speed, if you touch the accelerator you can quickly be in triple digits.  Quiet, smooth, powerful.  With our trailer hitch and optional roof rack, it is also quite functional.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Mike, 09/12/2019,Transmission is a deal breaker,1,"I seldom post reviews but feel compelled. If you are considering this car, pay attention to the comments here and elsewhere about the transmission on the 2.0L turbo. I have owned an Acura, Lexus and 2 BMWs and this engine is an engineering failure. It is fine at highway speed but most people use their cars for commuting or driving in their community. At lower speeds it is like riding on a bucking horse, particularly when downshifting. It will rock back and forth at idle. I have tried all combinations of driving mode and fuel grade and there is no difference. The car does have some luxury but also head scratchers like cheap plastic and lack of standard features. It is built on the Ford Edge platform, would suggest the Edge is a superior vehicle for much less. Or you could get the 6 cyl for another $10K."

lincoln,nautilus,2019,MTed y, 06/09/2019,Drove one for a week the good and bad,4,"The positive: 

This is a a larger suv but it is not too large and still feels sporty. We own a Durango and this only felt a little smaller. This has a better ride but I do really like the Durango. It is quiet and fit and finish is very good. Gas mileage wasn’t bad and it did handle as sporty as one could realistically expect. Technology was great, it was easy to get use to the features. Stereo was fantastic. 

The negative:

I’m 6’4 and the front seat comfort Was sub par. I’m not a Fat guy and I didn’t feel cradled at all, It didn’t go down enough even though I did have enough headroom. It was more of a high truck feel than anything else. Key fob is big .... honestly with those two issues it felt like the car was built for small females. "
lincoln,nautilus,2019,Sam, 05/02/2020,Not quite a lemon but...,2,"I’m 72 years old and never have owned a so called luxury vehicle so a year ago I decided to give Lincoln a try and purchased a fully loaded 2019 Nautilus. Was very impressed with its handling, comfortable ride and all of the bells and whistles. Since I’ve owned this vehicle, it’s been in the shop at least four times. Twice for a blank control screen which renders driving impossible as you cannot read any functions, once for a warning signal indicating that there was an issue with the cross lane indicator and one time for a warning about the auto control for the automatic speed controller. I now have another shop appointment due to the rear bumper separating. I also have an issue with a thumping noise between six to 65 mph. It is intermittent and therefore undetectable. Though not very loud, it is however very annoying. So much with the Lincoln quality and luxury that I was really looking for at my age.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,ThomasL, 12/08/2019,My 5th Lease of this size Lincoln,4,"Ok, it started in 2012 when I leased an MKX. Then 3 more and finally the new 2019 Nautilus. What can I say other than I like new and I do not drive much.
Pro: Easy entry and exit. Comfortable seat. Nice ride. Great mileage: about 24 overall. Good looking SUV. Also, Lincoln service picks up and delivers even for an oil change.

Cons: Not many:: I am not a fan of the push button transmission selection. Just too many buttons in that area....like the button I have to push to keep the engine shutting off every time I stop and start up again. If I could not shut that idiotic feature off, it would be a deal breaker on another Lincoln lease.
Others like this....namely Cadillac, Audi etc. get way too pricey way too fast for the same features. So I will probably lease number 6 when the time comes      (  . Also I lease a 2019 Mustang Ecoboost Convertible for summertime use; which to my surprise has more driver leg room than the Nautilus)    In my opinion the Nautilus does not take a back seat to any other luxury SUV.

lincoln,nautilus,2019,Car nut, 11/23/2019,"Lousy power train, ponderous handling",3,It's a shame what this car became.  Nice comfort features but the transmission slips and surges all over the place and the engine is underpowered and noisy for this price.  Lincoln should have kept the six cylinder.  Also while the ride is hushed and comfortable the trade off is overly soft handling.  It feels like the whole front end rolls over when making turns.  Finally it is much too expensive

lincoln,navigator,2000,LaceyP, 05/01/2010,Nothing but problems!,2,I would NEVER buy another Navigator. I have had nothing but problems with mine. The air suspension went out and is NOT cheap to fix. Also I've had transmission problems. Something in the transmission gets too hot and causes the seal to break and the transmission fluid to leak so transmission had to be rebuilt. The only positive thing about this vehicle is the room and seating but unfortunately I can't keep it running long enough to even enjoy that. If you have a ton of money to fix on ongoing repairs then this car is for you! These vehicles are bad for their suspension and transmission problems...I wish I would have known this before I wasted money buying mine.

With gas at $4 a gallon I still love it but for me the end is soon because being a woman I want something newer. 9 years is a long time for me.

So when it hit a 1,000,00 it was time to change the plugs which coursed another 500 but once the new plugs went in the coils all started to go bad one after another it went from a dream to a night mare.And to make matter worst now the sensors are starten to go one by one

Great power, incredible towing all in a luxery vehicle.  Then it developed the common vacuum leak of unknown location creating a lean bank condition and it burnt out the $3,000 CATS...now, nearly $4,000 in parts later it still keeps flaging a lean bank 1 error.

conception, and in March 2001 I bought 
one. After owning one for nearly 2 
years, I know I'll keep buying them as 
long as they build them. It was 
everything I wanted in an SUV and more.

anything other than regular 
maintenance, oil changes and tire 
rotations. I cannot think of better 
vehicle to take on a long road trip 
with children, and the size and weight 
gives me a feeling of security for my 
wife and children, the only negative of 
the vehicle is the fuel consumption. We 
do most in town driving and get around 
13.5 miles per gallon, but it is a 
small price to pay for the luxury,

to be paying $500/mo for 5 years for a 
used vehicle, but compared to the lease 
on a new one, which would be even 
higher and leave me with zero equity, 
this seemed like the way to go.  Most 
people who I know have assumed our Nav 
is brand new. On the first fill I seem 
to have gotten about 17 MPG - doesn't 
seem realistic given other reviews on 
here.  Next fill will tell all.  15 MPG 
would be OK in my book.  The truck 
seems to run just fine on reg. gas - 
with these prices that's a big deal.

we finally move from NJ to FL.    "

one being the rear end which burned up

reasons beyond its leather seats and 
lots of room. A rear load-leveling 
suspension adjusts the height of the 
vehicle according to cargo weight to 
assist in handling performance, while  
long wheel base help to provide a 
stable, cushioned ride. It's also 
easier to drive than it looks, thanks 
to a short turning radius, and variable 
assist power steering. Very 
comfortable; tons of space; lots of 
extras; handsome design. The class of 
the American SUVs. The best part is I

lincoln,navigator,2002,OG SUV lover, 08/16/2020,The Original Gangsta SUV,5,"Get ready to be stupefied mesmerized and petrified by this monster.  I bought mine in 2017 and she was showing her age with some seat tears and missing door handle trim plus one of the doors wont auto-lock. I had to replace the timing belt no biggie but then the steering box assly as she was not responding well to lane changes.  After that no problems.

I just love the beast. The front end looks beefy and yeah the rear is rather beamy but so what. I have had no problems with the engine or leaks in the sunroof as mentioned by others. I guess mine was built mid week when the guys on the line were mostly sober. 

The interior is huge with tons of space. The rear captains seats are awesome we use the rear centre console as a cooler on long trips just chuck the ice in and drinks and donesky.

It had 238k on it and I'm up to 256 now the engine purrs like a sleeping lion. She seemed sluggish on hills until I kept the overdrive enabled- problem solved there.

The heater core was gummed up so she would not heat well the first few winters even a trip to the dealer to request a flush didnt do much. I ended up following a few vids on you tube and blasted the sucker with my garden hose then blew it out manually to clear it further and it is much better now.

The fuel economy is not great but if I was focused on that Id a bought a Prius...not! 

I also own a Jetta and the difference in street cred when driving between the two is ridonculous. Everybody gives me a wide birth in the OG SUV  and when we pass by newer (read smaller dinkier) SUV's my son and I chuckle as we literally are looking down on these imposters.

Ive driven her each year cross country 1300km each way and she performed beautifully with very comfy ride. The air suspension farting that happens after engine shut off garners some strange glances from folks as well...like its digesting a cow it ate or something.

Anyhoo I'm surprised at how cheaply they sell for probably the low fuel economy is a turn off for many but if you can get past that and the retro wood veneer styling you will enjoy this vehicle. Just make sure you get one that wasnt built on a Saturday or Sunday yonk yonk!"

The family and I have been to 3 camping site's and people can't believe how I came to choosing the Navagator. Typically the norm was large pick up's, Chevy Suburbans and the Tahoe.

Mainly for the fact that, it was in the making to have a new body, and being totally redisigned, it's all because of 2003, that people have been buying Navigators.

this suv fulfills all my needs."
lincoln,navigator,2003,LuvMyNavi, 11/12/2008,Really Have Enjoyed It,4,"I bought this Navigator in 2002 and have really enjoyed it; I would keep it forever if I could. It is comfortable, quick to respond and a smooth ride. It continues to a reliable and comfortable family vehicle, with only a few minor problems in 7 years! It is just now beginning to show its age - just a little. I wish I could keep it forever, and maybe I will now that gas prices are dropping."

road with out a problem."

I'm always hauling around 3K lbs of

I've had some problems.  The chrome on 
the grill was flaking.  The back 
chrome accent the screws started to 
pop through.  The air compressor 
shocks went out, and the airbag light 
was coming on too.  The silenoid went 
out."
lincoln,navigator,2003,BlessedOne, 08/22/2002,"Simply the Best! Well, Almost!",4,"This SUV is a hit! I really love what 
Lincoln has done with this new 
version. It is miles ahead of the 
previous years model and far above the 
competition in certain areas. With 
that, I do have some gripes, my radio 
went out on me while we were on 
vacation. After taking the vehicle to 
2 dealerships, the problem still 
wasn't fixed. But 
fortunately, the corrective action was 
simple, the service people told me it 
appeared that certain early 2003's 
produced have a problem with the radio 
units. I had to remove all of the 
power to the unit by pulling all of 
the fuses for the radio and DVD unit.  
But overall all, I certainly highly 
recommend this new version."

ballpark!!!  The 2003 Lincoln 
Navigator perfectly combines luxury, 
style, comfort, and roominess.  The 
new slick design combined with high-

burlwood walnut (not plastic), nickel

vehicle on the road, definitely the 
nicest of any suv, period.  it's just 
not a question up for discussion.

better the earlier models, the 
interior has been made with cheaper 
materials. They used a lower quality 
of leather. The steerinring wheel 
looks as though it came out of a cheap 
toyota corolla. You think that for a 
premium vechile they wouldn't have 
cheapened the product. They must have 
made them at the old chicken 
farm,....cheap, cheap, cheap.."
lincoln,navigator,2003,TheGoodLife, 01/17/2003,Great SUV,4,"Got my 03 in Sept & have loved 
driving it. Quiet & smooth ride.  The 
handling characteristics give you 
confidence in any situation. Very agile 
despite size. The fuel economy is poor. 
Supposed to use 91+ fuel so that adds 
to the expense at the pump.Love the pwr 
running boards.IMO they help getting 
in & out especially for older 
passengers. We take father-in-law to dr 
appts & he absolutely loves & prefers 
the ride in that car over his.(Works 
for Caddy dealer) We could have 
purchased an Escalade $50 below dealer 
cost, but I was so impressed with the 
Navi & all the features that it had 
that the Caddy did not that I paid the 
higher price for the Navi"

to the new one, this puppy is NICE!  
The interior is as nice as anything 
else out there. I have an ultimate 
with all the toys.  Fold flat third 
row is the best feature.  Power 
liftgate comes in very handy.  This 
SUV also drives very smooth and tight.

from what i can tell its a great

lincoln,navigator,2003,DEThier777, 06/12/2003,New and Improved,4,"This 2003 Navigator is much improved 
over the 2000 model I traded in.  
Although the exterior of the new model 
is a little bland by comparison, the 
interior design and improved 
drivability more than make up for 
that.  This vehicle is also much better 
over all than the Cadillac Escalade 
which I test drove numerous times 
before deciding to opt for another 
Navigator.  The reliability of my 2000 
model was outstanding and I expect the 
same for the 2003. "
lincoln,navigator,2003,WJB-DO, 06/11/2003,My Navigator,4,"Simply awesome design, inside it is an 
art studio on wheels.  Outside it is 
rolling testosterone.  Ok enough, this 
vehicle is stunning, rugged, 
prestigious and simply enjoyably 
exciting.  And shouldn't your car be?  
People who say it needs more power are 
just comparing numbers (345hp vs. 
300hp).  Drive this and feel the 
torque.  Feel the balance of the 
steering and suspension that somehow 
connects 3 tons to the pavement like a 
sports car.  I'm sorry, escalade 
doesn't do that.  I couldn't be 
happier with mine."

is obvious Lincoln made safety features 
a priority with audible object

The car has every imaginable accessory, including after market DVD viewing screens in the headrest and front visor. The only problem I have had in 3 months is that the rear automatic  door doesn't close properly sometimes.  The car gets very poor gas mileage (about 11 mpg) and requires premium gas.I have tried lower grades of fuel, which seems to work okay.  The Navigation system does not work as well as those from Garmin (Street Master III).  The car doesn't hold its value very well. The car, as equipped, would have retailed for more than $65,000. I bought it with 20,000 miles for $35,000. I enjoy the car very much."

I have owned Ford Explorers and 
Expeditions and was not ready for the 
refined driving experience so far.

As with everything there is a down 
side.  The first 8400 miles I have 
replaced a seat cover for 
discoloration and an alternator.  The 
dealer has been good about handling my 
complaints but not really forth coming 
on what has caused the defects.  To 
tell you the truth I think a factory 
hotline for consumer reports and 
repairs would go a long way in 
improving the whole Lincoln experience!"

The 03 was the first year out of the totally new design.  It has had some ""new model"" issues, but all of them minor, and never stranding me.  Mostly glitches in the features of the truck.  The interior is drop-dead gorgeous, from the steering wheel, to the plasma display dash, reminiscent of the 61 Continental.  It's roomy, comfortable, and the 3rd seat folds totally flat into the floor, with a power motor.  The seating is extraordinary.  I truly feel this is the best design on the market, and the best value for the money.  The engine is great, but the mileage is poor, as you would expect."

7/02, I read a review which ended 
with ""This elephant can tap dance.""  I 
took it with a grain of salt but 
completed my purchase anyway.  I 
decided to write this review after a 
truly great experience.  It had been 
raining heavily today and I rounded a 
curve at about 40 mph to find myself 
right in front of a huge ""pond"".  I had 
no time to break but just plowed into 
this pool of water.  I expected the 
worst, but guess what?  This baby just 
plowed through with not even a jolt to 
the steering wheel, straight ahead.  
The handling on this monster is 
comparable to a sportscar.  I LOVE MY 
NAVIGATOR!!!"

worked wonderful. The 2003 model has 
less power and the AC blows hot air 
when traffic, not good in Texas. Been 
told that when RPM goes under 1000, the 
AC will blow 5-10 degrees warmer, what 
a engineering piece of crap. Also, 
mirrors make a lot of noise, muffler 
makes noise, overall, not as smooth and 
quiet as my old truck. Will never buy 
another one, it's embarrasing that it 
spend so much time in the shop, and 
nothing is ever fixed, there is always 
a reason for the faultiness."

The bells and whistles were amazing, it was a top of the line luxury SUV.  Once my car hit 70k miles it fell apart!!

I am so tired of putting money into this car.  If you get one make sure you buy the extended warranty.  These cars are know for having big problems.

For a vehicle we mainly drive to and from work and Costco, this so called top of the line gas guzzling beast should not have these kinds of problems at 77,000 miles. Ford should be ashamed.

The safety of these cars is top notch! Because of this, we decided to buy another navi. I freaking love this car! It looks so stylish and is very very comfortable to ride in. The turning radius is great because the front wheels actually tilt slightly when you turn the wheel so you can easily turn around on a small road. The power is excellent with its 5.4L V8 engine...what a monster! We have had a few problems with the nav though, some power seat motors have broken (covered by warranty) The rear a/c unit clicks. And worst of all the gps/radio has crapped out. But I still love my nav"

SUVs such as the Cadillac Escalade, Hummer H2, Range Rover, Infiniti QX56, Mercedes Benz GL Class, etc... This vehicle is at the top of the luxury chain in my opinion rated bias or not. I have test driven other SUVs and nothing compares to this. It gets me and my family around comfortably and it feels like home even on the road considering the ultimate entertainment system. I have had no problems when driving it and the only thing I see when I drive is heads turning. Overall, this SUV's amazing"

Out of 5 yrs of ownership, the quality, ride, and overall performance has been excellent.  In retrospect, I wish the HP were bumped up a bit; especially in light of new technology.  But, oh well.

improved over the 98 with the exception 
of the engine.While the 98 had a 16 
valve engine, it took regular gas. 
There is no improvement in the gas 
milage with the 32 valve engine and it 
takes only premium gas,and plenty of 
it.Plus, the engine is a little tired. 
It could also do very nicely with at 
least a five speed transmission"

superior to 2001, brakes are far 
superior to 2001 and stability is much 
improved, but. ......... there is too 
much wind noise, and the new 
transmission has very weird shift 
points, and you find yourself always up 
at 2200/2600 rpm until it finally 
upsifts. The navigation system is not 
what I expected. Plus you cannot alter 
your route or preferences once you pass 
9 mph.The funny thing is that the two 
cup holders up front will not hold the 
travel mugs Lincoln give you, the 
handles collide. The new sound system 
is not as good as the 2001 where you 
could adjust acoustics"

They CAN NOT hold a candle to the 
Navigator. Everyone we know who are 
very recent owners of new SUV's and has 
seen our 2004 Navi, they are kicking 
themselves for not looking at a 
Navigator. We get so many OOOOHHS and 
AAAAHHS. After being years as a 
Mercedes family, we are thrilled to now

looking at the competitors such as 
Cadillac and the Denali.  We settled 
on the Navigator because although it 
had less power than the others, the 
overall style, especially the interior 
was far above the Cadillac or Denali. 

We had traded in a '00 Expidetion on 
it and what a differance between the 
two.  The new Lincoln is much more 
stable and does not wallow as like the 
Expy did.  It would be nice if it had 
400hp, but it does cruise very well

easily.  "

I pull a 21' trailer with 4 Harley 
dressers and after you get them rolling 
you almost forgit they're back there. 
The problem comes as you try to get 
them rolling, as you pull away from a 
stop light you can watch the gas guage 
go down faster than the speedo goes up. 
All kidding aside the Navigator is a 
really great SUV, I would like to see 
more power, as for the gas mileage, you

purchased it, so no complaints "

the schnazzy interior.  This truck is a 
much nicer design, with the 4 wheel 
independent suspension, the power 
folding flat 3rd row seats, and the 
unique interior.  It's not as 
bulletproof as the 99 was for total

I've had none of the electrical problems that have plagued reviews. Biggest complaint, dealership serves Lincoln, and Mercury.  Service area is like the waiting room for a middle school.

lincoln,navigator,2004,Jack Williams, 01/31/2006,Best Vehicle on the Planet,4,We bought the Navigator off the showroom floor.  After wanting one for several years we finally were able to buy one--a white one.  It has been everything we expected it to be.  It was built in the United States by American workers at Ford Motor Company.  Its quality and workmanship are reflected in the outstanding performance we get from owning it.  We buy American as much as possible.  Our family has driven only Fords since the early 1900s.

Head light repairs (3) which is not just a bulb. My local dealer has to order parts which means multiple trips for something that used to be a 5 minute job. Air compressor for front suspension replaced. Both front door glass windows are scratched vertically for which the dealer says I don't keep the car clean.    The car went back for bad spark plugs when new. Has a whining drivetrain bearing noise dealer says is the tires. Tomorrow she's going in for ABS and Advanced Trac warning lights.

It is exactly what I look for in a car. Very true lincolns quote from the 90s which they should still use ..Lincoln ..what a luxury car should be. Anyhow it's wonderful it's just about everything combined into one. Luxury of a sedan the towing of a pick up truck and the room of a minivan. Navigator I believe has to be the best car on the road ..aside from the rolls Royce phantom of course although it has the inspired grill so there you go. The options on the navigator are above and beyond its competitors. Love the keyless entry code pad I use that all the time . No key needed to enter the car! Love how the seats fold flat in both 2nd n 3rd row . It's comfortable no matter which seat you seat in and driving  is great with the air ride suspension. Heated and colder seats
Are one of my favorite options along with the parking sensors would not know want to do without them. The mirrors tilt down ward in reverse , can be optioned with power running boards that step out with the door opens , power third row seating folds down , power
Lift gate , amazing sound system for
The radio and DVD player. I love the car. Could

A head turner for sure everybody loves it and always have attention driving or parking it. Mine is in the pearl tri coat best color with the light ivory interior. 
Now for
The cons first is the gas ..i currently am getting only 12mpg however you pay for what you get the quality is unparalleled . The navigator does not have get up and go acceleration because it's so heavy so don't expect a sport car. Lastly the navigator is can be difficult I. Parking lots , drive ways. Most parking spots barely accommodate the navigator properly usually it's tight and risky. 
Minimum  Matniance never needed anything out of the ordinary. Dealer service is superb 
Anyways 5 stars ! American made luxury full size suv best in class forever!

lincoln,navigator,2005,Rick, 11/06/2009,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT",4,I bought a 2005 fully loaded ultimate 4x2 navigator in September 2009. I had two jeeps and a fully loaded dodge ram pickup prior to this navigator and there is no comparison. I love my navi. It drives like a dream the engine is powerful and smooth. Love the air suspension fills like your riding on air. I will drive it until the wheels fall off and then my next car will be a navigator 
lincoln,navigator,2005,t328, 01/12/2013,Solid.,4,"This was my first car, and overall, it's been outstanding. The timeless exterior and interior design are, in my opinion, more attractive than the latest generation. I haven't had trouble with rattles or squeaks, and all of the trim pieces have been extremely durable. It's been very reliable, just a couple of minor fixes here and there. The driving dynamics are reminiscent of a much smaller car, and the acceleration is impressive. The air ride suspension makes Texas dirt roads feel like the Nurburgring. Naturally, fuel economy is a pain; I usually get around 14 mixed. However, I drive pretty assertively and use regular gas. Overall, fantastic vehicle, I just wish I could afford the gas."
lincoln,navigator,2005,Melissa, 10/01/2010,Awesome Truck,4,My navigator is almost 6 years old with 125K miles.  Only major repairs so far alternator (Jan 2008) and had to replace rotors twice.  Tires lasted 100k+ miles.  Truck still rides like new.  This is my second Navigator and I would not trade it for anything.
lincoln,navigator,2005,Homer Gaines, 08/26/2005,Not worth the operating cost,3,"The gasoline milage of this vehicle is far below what was stated on the sticker. Lincoln says it's my driving habits, but whether I use a feather on the accelerator or not, it still gets 8 MPG in normal driving, and the best I have gotten on the highway is 14MPG. And that's with a mighty tailwind!"
lincoln,navigator,2005,Mike Smith, 11/11/2006,fordwarrior,4,"I have been a satisfied Ford product owner for 50 years. I have owned a 2004 and a 2005 Navigator and have been very disappointed in their fuel economy and the quality of construction.  The 2006 has had transmission problems from the day it was delivered and it took 17 months for the dealer to get the problem corrected.  The brake rotors had to be turned at 7,000 miles, replaced at 10,000 miles, turned again at 27,000 mile and replaced at 30,000 miles.  This is on a vehicles that has 95% highway mileage on it.  The master brake cylinder had to be replaced at 32,000 miles.  The 2006 model is much noisier than the 2005 in terms of wind noise and engine/road noise. "
lincoln,navigator,2005,Mark L, 07/25/2008,3 Great Years,4,"Our Navigator is 3 years old with 45,000 miles and has had no issues. The maintenance is very inexpensive but definitely is not fuel efficient, averaging around 13 miles per gallon. Very pleased with this purchase will likely keep this one for at least another 45k miles."
lincoln,navigator,2005,bk183, 11/01/2008,Navigator #2,4,"I like the look of the Escalade a little better but after test driving 3 different then the 05 Navigator there was no comparison. The Navigator out handled, was quieter, smoother ride, and just easier to drive. Big improvement over my 01 which was no slouch. I have to say, so far this is the best vehicle I have ever owned."
lincoln,navigator,2005,Jon Levy, 01/11/2005,Edmunds does Underrate it,4,"After fixing a moonroof rain leak, the car is perfect.  Checked out the Escalade, but did not like it's warmed- over 1980's interior and dash.  The Lexus 470 was a major disappointment... like a modest car trying to feel expensive and failing.  The 'Gator interior is superb..... very luxurious... and the new features e.g. power liftgate, power running boards (and large, unlike Escalade and 470's much to small running boards), etc, make it by far the best choice.  This is my second 'Gator.... the 1st being a 2002.  This new one is even better.  Oh, the LX470 has NO sensors on rear bumper for back up.  Only a camera which is not nearly as helpful as the warning sounds."
lincoln,navigator,2005,edgar, 03/04/2010,MPG,4,My 2005 Lincoln navigator mpg Gauge is going down. When I bought it was reading 13.2 then 12.9 now is reading 12.8.  I would like to hear from some one  if  this is normal or something is wrong.
lincoln,navigator,2005,Lisa, 02/01/2006,So/So,3,"After major rebates and 0% financing, car is still upside down after two years of payments. Rattles and clanks noticed from the beginning, service cannot fix. Aftermarket upgrades sold by the dealership installed too low and rattle. When rattle fixed, screw tore interior sunroof fabric. Aftermarket dealership DVD unreliable and not upgraded to play DVD Rs or RW.  A nice vehicle but market value dropped after purchase. "
lincoln,navigator,2005,Mr.LincolnAJ, 07/18/2019,"""14 years old and still breaking necks""",5,"My first Navigator model was a 98"" when they first came out. I wasn't to impressed with that one. However when they redesigned it in 03 it was a must have or at least I thought so till they created the 05 version. The 05 is the same as the 03-04 model except it has cleaner lines. For example rectangular fog lights, and the side moldings on the door are more smoother. The power retractable running boards are also color coded to match the truck on the ultimate trim level. My Navi is a beautiful pearl white with the original 18"" chrome wheels. Off white leather with the black trim around the edges really looks amazing. The wood dash with the nickel plated accents still make this car feel modern. It will be hard for me to find something that interior can compete with this old school luxury lol. The THX system still sounds clear as day, just wish bluetooth or aux was an option back in the day. However I added the aftermarket Bluetooth kit which works ok with the stock system. Today she just hit 198k and the only major things I replaced was the air suspension system which commonly fails on these trucks, spark plugs which I did at 120k and an A/C regulator / blendoor  to make the air blow out of the dash vents. Of course there's regular maintenance items like brakes, batteries etc. Nothing major though. I love Love LOVE this truck as it still rides and look new as I try to baby it. I just recently purchased a 2018 Expy limited and the ride still doesn't compare. The 05-06 Nav was ford's best built luxury model SUV. If you're in the market for one and can afford the gas (""Premium Only"") I would give this a look. They're pretty cheap now for a late model, just make sure you replace the suspension with the coil spring system and you're good to go. I will truly hate it when the old girl dies !!!!

lincoln,navigator,2005,Linny, 02/05/2009,Driving my Beast!,4,"I have had 3 Jeeps, 1 Honda Pilot and none compare to my 2005 Navi.  I bought it recently 20,000 miles.  Just awesome all the way around.  Black in color with all the trimmings...totally loaded.  I actually have gotten a little better mpg than I had imagined.  Very comfy even in the third road.  I am going to invest in the Catch all brand of floor mats to protect the carpet and who could ask for more???  Love it!  loVe iT! LOVE IT!"
lincoln,navigator,2005,Tom Webb, 01/27/2005,Love My Navigator,4,"This is the second Navigator we have owned, previously had two Suburbans. The Navigator is much more fun to drive, more comfortable on long trips, and over all a better vehicle. We have traveled all over Western USA, through all kinds of weather, it is super for all situations. Our friends prefer to have us drive, as it is much more comfortable than their vehicles."
lincoln,navigator,2005,Michael Johnson, 10/18/2005,WOW!!!!,4,"I had never considered a Nav, I'm 6'3"" - the Escalade was a huge disappointment - dash and emergency brake cut into my shin and leg!  Happened upon the Nav by chance.  Was very taken with comfort, pick-up and ease of handling!  I was surprised by the comments about lacking power, as the ""Baby"" moves like a bat out of hell and thinks 90 is an appropriate cruising speed.  Among the most comfortable and supportive seats I have ever had in a car.  I will agree that the gas mileage was a kick in the head -- but considering it's size and weight it could be alot worse.  All in all -- an A+ on the car -- which does not extend to the dealership --yuck!"
lincoln,navigator,2005,Rick, 01/23/2005,AWESOME SUV,4,"Drove many different SUVs, ranging from Lexus 470 to Expedtion. This by far was the best SUV. "
lincoln,navigator,2005,ubgoofy2003, 07/11/2009,Needs to Improve,2,"I have owned Ford products before & this Lincoln has had more things go wrong with it than even a F-150 pickup that I owned previous to this. Too much plastic where strength is needed & the control center(information) is located in such a hidden place, it is almost impossible to read in daylight. The center armrest council is imposible to open, unless you use both hands, & turn your body towards it. It should lift from the side, where it can be done with one hand. For a LUXURY car, the grill is plastic & should not be. I believe a luxury car should be of more quality than this, not just added assesories. The only advantage of this car, over a Isuzu Rodeo, is size. Needs Quality !!!!!"
lincoln,navigator,2005,Geo A, 01/06/2005,What a Deal,4,"My deal was zero percent financing, 9 grand off the sticker and it's off the lot. Its turn radius is the best, the 18 inch tires eat bumps, and with all gadgets included it beats the Escalade. Mileage stinks: it averages 13 mpg"
lincoln,navigator,2005,Derrick Soo, 02/15/2005,Navigator Dud,3,"Since taking delivery, this DUD is now approaching 3 weeks worth of repair time. Had to contact Lincoln CEO & DM to get this last service done. Customer service is non-existent and rude. This was my second Navigator, and will be the last. SUV has been in for two major repairs and replacements. First was total front drive system and steering, now Tranny. Had side panels fall off on the freeway and the HID headlights didn't work upon delivery. Lincoln has not been helpful at all. No loaners at Hayward Lincoln. "
lincoln,navigator,2005,Oberwerk, 07/27/2005,"2nd Nav., '05 Best Ever",4,"After 53K trouble-free miles on my '02 Nav, I thought an '05 Expedition Limited might be just as nice for 10K less.  Test drove the Ford and was disappointed- not as nice as my '02 Nav.  Then checked out the '05 Nav and was surprised to see how much they've improved.  Bought it and have been very pleased.  Major improvement over my '02, and I was quite happy with that."
lincoln,navigator,2005,nvbanker, 08/17/2005,Just gets better,4,"The 05 has a new engine and transmission that make the truck even better, more responsive, and useful.  The 6 speed transmission shifts like butter, and gives the truck some real spunk off the line.  I don't think any other truck in this class can touch it."

we have had no problems, not even minor 
mechanical or electrical ones.  The 
seats and ride are both very 
comfortable and the engine is more than 
adequate.  On a 5,000 mile vacation 
drive to several areas of the west, we 
even took it on some 4 X 4 only roads 
meant for Jeeps and although a little 
wide in places it performed well and I 
used low range on it for the first time 
ever and it got us to some places with 
spectacular views.  Very quiet inside

lincoln,navigator,2005,K Foster, 11/13/2004,Super SUV,4,"This is my second Navigator. I 
currently own two Mustangs as well. I 
have driven many suvs and luxury cars. 
This Navigator is by far the nicest 
vehicle I have ever riden in or driven. 
The comfort of the seats have no equal. 
I do wish it had a touch more low end 
torque to move out a little better 
without mashing the gas so much. It is 
thirsty and has a much larger blind 
spot than my 99 Nav did. Biggest 
problem with buying a Navigator is the 
price and the fact that if you get one, 
that is all you will ever be satisfied 
with. It is that far ahead. I have the 
black interior with silver exterior. 
Others considered were the Lexus and 
Expedition and lastly Escalade."
lincoln,navigator,2005,D-Money, 11/17/2004,lincoln review,4,"This Lincoln is great. it is great to

confortable."
lincoln,navigator,2005,reltd, 11/11/2004,Navigator,3,"Looked at Eddie Bauer, Expedition, 
Navigator, and Escalade.  Liked the 
price of Expedition, but the luxury of 
the two other vehicles.  Did not like 
the fact that the back seat did not lie 
flat in the Escalade.  Was able to get 
a great deal on Navigator (less then 
wholesale).  Purchased.  If I had to do 
it again, I might not.  I might go with 
the Expedition or Escalade.  I'm a 
little disappointed with Navigator.  
Interior trim work is not quality for 
the money.  The gas mileage is low, not 
a surprise 13/17, but the need for 
premium gas was.  The air-suspension 
ride is smooth, but not sure if it 
outweighs other drawbacks."
lincoln,navigator,2005,MoXXy, 11/17/2004,Lincoln is better than Edmunds says,4,"I test drove the Escalade (Reg& XL) The 
Lincoln had more room and more luxury 
than the Caddys.In the XL there are 3 
tiny steps in the very back that make 
you feel like your eating your 
knees.The Reg.Escalade was  smaller 
than the other two.While the Caddy has 
a teeny bit more power,the Lincoln can 
Scat as well.I bought the Lincoln 
Navigator.I also Drove the Pathfinder 
Armada and if the body style on the 
outside were different I would have 
picked that one over both.It had 
Everything the Lincoln had and alot 
more power than the Caddy!That thing 
was amazing but the body style was not 
my style.It's too bad because it would 
have been cheaper by about 12,000.00 
bucks."

I just love to drive my Navi even for 
minor errands to the store.  Everytime 
I drive my Navigator I feel like I am 
in the best SUV on the market.  I seek 
out Escalades, Yukons, Expeditions, 
Denali's, etc. just to show off my 
Velvet Red w/chrome trim Navigator.  I 
have the best looking and best 
performing SUV on the road today."

The air suspension makes the drive 
smooth and the air tight doors and 
windows makes for a quiet drive. The 
power deployable running boards and  
liftgate is an outstanding feature for 
anyone especially women with children. 
The extensive safety features on this 
vehicle was a buying factor for my 
family. The side air bag curtains seems 
like a great feature to have for the 
safety of my children. The roll 
stability sounds great knowing that 
SUV's tend to flip. The fuel economy is 
within normal range of a large SUV, 
although the increased gas prices do 
not help. Not featured in most SUV's  
is the 3rd row seat that is comfortable 
with plenty of leg space. "

lincoln,navigator,2005,Ted Bliss, 01/15/2005,"PRACTICAL, SAFE, COMFORTABLE, AND FUN!",4,"I spent many months checking out various vehicles before deciding on the Lincoln Navigator. Starting with no limitations on price, make or manufacturer, I initially ruled out many vehicles that did not meet my basic criteria, then proceeded to rank the remaining vehicles on a basis of safety, practicality, comfort, and lastly the ""fun"" factor. My basic criteria:- minimum seating capacity of 7 or 8, to accomodate family and friends- 4 wheel or all wheel drive available, to visit my in-laws- available safety, comfort and convenience features for long trips The Navigator met or exceeded these basic ""requirements"" and did it in style. My favorite features are listed in the next section."
lincoln,navigator,2005,Steve Stafford, 01/23/2005,2004 Navigator Ultimate review,4,"Handling is excellent--feels responsive like a much smaller vehicle. Air suspension is flawless--better ride and handling than Cadillac, Tahoe, Dodge--equal to or better than Lexus and Infinity. Interior has much better quality of materials than Escalade, almost the equal of Lexus. Third seats have excellent leg room.  Power third seats, power tailgate are pluses. Far more space, power and towing than Lexus. Has low range transfer case.  Wants and wishes; More interior storage bins, rear backup camera, Telescoping steering wheel, more bass in stereo system, more interior lights on front floor and in seat storage consoles."

lincoln,navigator,2005,njbaran99, 03/19/2005,2005 Navi Ultimate,4,"have the Navi for 1 week now and lovethe SUV, so far.  Strongly considered QX56/Armada but had concern on the brakes Issues.  Also looked at Escalade, but felt too much like a suburban and Durango was just too small. Navi(s) are a highway cruiser if there ever was one.  This beast weighs 6,000# which is heavy, but complements the ride and adds to firmness on the road. A little concerned about expected reliability, as some have reported major electrical issues, hope they got all this figured out by the 2005 Model. I got the Navi just under invoice with all available incentives, so it was a bit pricey, compared to some alternatives, but plan to keep it long enough to enjoy as it depreciates."
lincoln,navigator,2005,Rayw, 07/13/2005,Worth the Wait,4,"I have waited for a couple of years to finally get a navigator (divorce).  It was worth the wait.  The ride is amazing, the sound quality of the THX Certified stereo is great.  The conveiences abound.  I research many vehicles and tried out a number.  None came close to the Navigator's looks, room or ride."
lincoln,navigator,2005,rudy, 08/08/2005,2005 Navigator,4,"3,000 miles in one month. Great truck for all around use. averaged 17 mpg on highway and 13 in city. not bad for such a heavy truck. Lincoln did very well on the all around design. Looks timeless."
lincoln,navigator,2005,Ricardo, 08/22/2005,Great SUV,5,"I have had my 2005 Lincoln Navigator Ultimate 4x4 for about 10 months now. I bought it top of the line, except I didn't get Sirius Satellite Radio. I have had only one problem with it: the right power-deployable running board stopped working and would not retract. I took it to the dealership and they said that it short-circuited. They ordered a new running board for me and replaced it for free. The Touch Screen Navigation system is very easy to use. The THX-Certified surround sound system is like being in a movie theatre! The power liftgate is a great feature (which, by the way, is not available on the Escalade ESV Platinum which is about $5K more). Xenon headlights make the car stand out."
lincoln,navigator,2005,Hubert Van Goeye, 08/20/2005,FishingJoe,4,The main feature I appreciate is the advancetrac. I've made several trips from WA to MT in the winter and it has kept me on the road upright when other 4WD vehicles were in the ditches. It definitely goes in ice & snow. The ABS system is great and I've never had a problem with control when I had to swerve to miss other drivers or animals that wanted in my lane.
lincoln,navigator,2005,Don Smith, 09/14/2005,Love The Nav!,4,Great SUV! Retired and travel back and forth to Arizona pulling a 12' cargo trailer. Has plenty of power and not all that bad of mileage considering the trailer. Get 10 MPG pulling the trailer and between 14 to 16 empty. Usually 14 around town. Only thing I would change is to have more storage inside. Console storage is too small as well as door pockets.
lincoln,navigator,2005,George Hollowell, 09/17/2005,Good to Excellent,4,New 6peed automatic trans is a great feature. Engine power is excellent. I pull an RV it has plenty of torque. Economy is excellent for its size. Handling is superb.

The engine is not quiet though when it is in park........It's embarrassing to drive up in this luxury suv and the engine can be heard. I am getting that checked asap.  Besides, everyone gawking at my gator, or peeking inside the windows when they think i'm not looking.............This suv is close to perfect!  "
lincoln,navigator,2006,Jay Gowens, 05/23/2005,Needs more Horse-Power,4,"No other ride compares (speaking primarily about the suspension), and I have driven most luxury models, but I have to say more torque and horse-power is needed to eliminate that slight sense of drag during ecceleration."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Richard Hill, 07/24/2005,Great design & value,4,"Okay were do you start? The nature of the beast is she is a big SUV with 5.4. Don,t expect good MPH or blood rushing performance & because of the price you get what you pay for in terms of finish. However, she is reliable,well designed,has a massive carrying bay & one of the best looking 4 x 4 (excluding new Range Rover)on the road.  She is very comfortable on long boring trips with all the nice bits in the cabin. Braking is very good & cornering is forgiving on that unexpected bend. I just would like Lincoln to spend a little more money on the general finish internally like our Japanese cousins do.I would not hesitate to replace her with the same model or recommend this vehicle to a friend "
lincoln,navigator,2006,Charles Robertson, 11/03/2010,Luxury Workhorse,3,"This beast has been a pleasure.  It has hauled our family of seven on several trips to Florida, hauled boats and jet skis, and innumerable trips to Home Depot, while making the trips to the grocery store and school functions with ease.  The 4WD/AWD makes it feel very safe in bad weather, and although we haven't needed much in the way of service it was easy to get worked on, no matter where we were (not so much with our BMW!) The power rear seat and video options made this a kid cruiser without equal.  This isn't a practical vehicle for everyone, but it was a wonderful choice for us.  40k miles, no regrets."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Archangel, 12/09/2006,A leftover 2006 Navigator w/3 dings...,4,"The 2006 Navigator is a wide body luxury experience; however, the interior does not live up to its level of classification, as many have already mentioned.  My vehicle is a leftover and has hail damage (3 dings) that the dealership has agreed only to repair one at its cost.  The 2007 has a cleaner and leaner interior, but the button to fold the side mirrors inward is very confusing.  The drive, however, is smoother then the 2006, and you feel in control as you quickly pass on lookers, who can only look in envy."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Mike, 02/28/2006,So-So Experience with Navigator,3,"It was between this Navigator and a Range Rover Sport. The deals and financing Lincoln was offering was leaps and bounds better than Land Rover was offering. So far, the navigation system only works when it wants to and half the time doesn't know where the car is, or the screen won't come up. My biggest complaint is the seating. The heated/cooled seats are too firm and need to have softer filling. Beware that the Ultimate seats with the heating and cooling are stiffer than the standard luxury seats. After driving for a period of time, the seats are so stiff that my legs fatigue and become numb. The seats should be softer for a $60K vehicle and have not such a hard and unforgiving feel. "
lincoln,navigator,2006,Karen Heinberg, 06/15/2018,My 20 year love affair with Navi’s,5,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this vehicle. I’ve been driving Navigators  for almost 20 years. I owned one for five years, one for three years, and this last one for 12 years (bought it in October 2006).  I hate to let it go, but my kids are now grown, and I don’t need this much vehicle any longer.  All three of my Navigators have been reliable, and service at my dealership has been fantastic. I feel like a member of the family there. The ONLY Downside is fuel economy. Terrible in the city (9-10) Slightly better on the highway (17).   2006 was the last year that the Navigator was made without an auxiliary or USB port.   That technology came out starting in 2007.

Sound system, remote folding mirrors, retractable running boards, air- conditioned front seats and electric tailgate all get comments.  The third row seating is adult sized, and the electric folding seat option is worth having.  With judicious driving I get 18 mpg without much effort, but average 15 mpg.  There is a big difference between city driving and cruising with this car.  I've maxed 21.7 mpg on one perfect trip to LA."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Jennifer, 08/26/2008,Overpriced Bucket of Bolts,2,"So I've had my Navigator for about 2 yrs now and have had it in the shop at least 5 times. The most common issue was the plastic side plate where the seat controls are located. The drivers side has had to be replaced three times and the passenger once. Another annoying issue was the passenger side door.  he panel keeps popping off.  3 times for this. After the 1st time it was fixed the seals began leaking.  I've now had to have the seals replaced twice.  Most currently were the fan control, navigation, and transmission issues. One doesn't expect to have tranmission issues after only two yrs and paying $60K. Other minor issues include the 3rd row vent popping, and 2nd row trim pcs missing."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Jason, 06/13/2008,Recommended,4,"I traded my 2000 Nav in when I purchased my new 2006 Nav and the improvement have been incredible. I've put on 45,000 miles on my 06 and it's never been in the shop once. Very reliable and comfortable. You get a lot for your money, folding 3rd row seats, automatic tailgate, TMX sounds system vs. other luxury SUVs. I would definitely recommend this vehicle for those of you reading my review. I put 98K miles on my 2000 Nav and had no problems. "
lincoln,navigator,2006,Bill, 01/08/2006,2006 Lincoln Navigator,4,"Good power, wonderful ride quality, great handling, easy to park even in tight lots. For its size the highway MPG is very good (about 20+). Great family car for trips especially with the spacious third row seating. Luxury and quality throughout. Excellent towing capacity."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Joe, 12/22/2006,Improvement needed,3,"My second. 1998 was a quiet, reliable vehicle with over 115,000 miles. 2006 has only 6,000 miles is very noisy up to 60 mph, leaks oil and has a navigation system that works sometimes. Quality has gone downhill. I have been to the dealer 3 times to repair the oil leak. What a disappointment from my previous Navigator."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Dragon, 05/13/2007,Nice!,4,This vehicle drives like a dream. There is plenty of room for all and setable seat positions for two. I will keep this car till the wheels fall off.
lincoln,navigator,2006,hilnavigator, 12/31/2008,"2006 Navigator, my 4th",3,"After having a 1998, 2001, 2003, and now a 2006 Navigator, I must say the 2003 overall ride/performance  was the best. The 2006 engine noise is more on hard acceleration, the 6 speed transmission still has shift issues, especially in slow traffic, lots of clunking and ruff shifts. My 06 now has only 18,000 miles. Need for premium gas is a negative when gas was running 4 plus bucks a gallon. Could have better ride on rough roads, original Michelin tires ride not as good as Continentals. Replaced with Pirelli 20 in, as supplied on 2007's, nice riding tires, & looks great with 07 rims, but a noisy bumpy ride for first 10 minutes till they round out, but great in snow. Lower radiator hoseclamp failed"
lincoln,navigator,2006,luis, 09/14/2005,can build it better than a rover,3,"this suv is very nice, neat design but it lacks power and the inside rattles at times. security system for this vehicle should be improved also key should have a more distinctive look, rear middle seat should be as practicle as other seats,  finally its time to make as big in room as the escalade ext. engine knocks at times when starting it shouldn't at any time just like the competitors don't"
lincoln,navigator,2006,e welch, 07/30/2005,best suv in the world,5,"I drove them all, the Navigator for the money was the best.  The dealer was also a big reason....one price easy atmosphere and a great owner.  Lincoln really did a great job with this vehicle very smooth ride and very quiet. love my navigator! e"
lincoln,navigator,2006,Ryan, 08/10/2005,Hard for this one to disappoint,4,"Just bought this about a month ago and have driven it about 1000 miles so far. It's a pleasure to drive and really is luxurious. My wife bought a new Lexus Rx330 last year, so I have been comparing both. On the whole, I like the Navigator better because of its size, but there are a few luxury items that the Lexus has that would be nice to have on the Navigator. Overall, I love this new Navigator, and I'm glad I chose it over the Escalade. My friend has an Escalade that I've driven, and I had serious reservations about some of it's features.  For my money, the Navigator is the best luxury full-size SUV out there, and nearly everyone I know really talks about how great it looks."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Ken, 09/18/2005,"Liked the '03, but love the '06",4,"I had an '03 and thought that was a good truck, but the '06 drives much better. They improved steering, transmission and the engine."
lincoln,navigator,2006,MS JAKI, 01/27/2006,My 2006 Lincoln navy,4,"Wonderful driving experience, above all i feel absolutely safe since i am female and single.  Excellent power and take off, riding up high above smaller cars is great also feel safe in ice and snow and i have great traction with 4 wheel drive and other drive options.  Outside is sleek and i get unlimited compliments on my navy.  It's great to have the retractable running boards but the ultimate is the automatic lift gate that is wonderful in the winter when i go grocery shopping and the heated seats are the best"
lincoln,navigator,2006,keith foster, 08/04/2005,The one to buy.,4,"My second. Put well over 100K miles on my 99 Nav. It would be nice to have a few more ponies and mileage, but that could be said of most all vehicles. Interior is on mine is black, exterior is silver. Best looking and best finished of any SUV as far as I am concerned. Handling in wet and around sweeping turns above 70mph is very good even though mine is 2wd. Braking is excellent, but with stock pads dust is horrible. You won't be disappointed with the luxury. Service at local dealer is biggest complaint. One small problem becomes many problems after they get done. Selling dealer did a great job, but to far to take it to them for service. I would buy it."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Bob Drake, 03/14/2006,My Navigator,4,"I have owned nine saburbans and one Expidition over the years I was in business. The handling and comfort is far superior to the other vehicles. The Expidition was close. I see where Ford is building a vehical similar to the suburban, I would be interested if Lincoln would also build one similar to the Cadilac Escalade XL."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Miami Vice, 06/13/2006,New to the Lincoln Brand,4,"My wife and I just leased a Navigator and so far we are thrilled.  We looked at Acura, Infiniti, Nissan, Lexus, and Mercedes.   The Lincoln makes you feel ""PIMP""  It is very comfortable and the interior is very well layed out.  I never thought I would drive a Lincoln, but I am very happy I decided to go with the Navigator.  So far so good."
lincoln,navigator,2006,D Waters, 08/03/2006,Great for a Lincoln,3,"The Navigator is a hit with us, but now Mercedes and GM are making more economic and Luxurious SUVs, so Lincoln needs to stay int the game. The car is really noisy and (OBVIOUSLY) it's a real pain in the neck to fill it up at the pump. It's very comfortable and the third row is actually quite spacious. Overall, if you're someone who wants a luxury full size SUV, I might recommend the Audi Q7 or M-Benz GL450 a tad bit more, but if you need to haul a lot(I mean A LOT!), I'd recoomend this car a tad bit more than the GL, Q7, or Escalade (just a tad, because the design of both the exterior and interior isn't as elegant as the Mercedes or Audi)."
lincoln,navigator,2006,gynrat, 07/17/2005,Awesome,4,"So far this vehicle is everything and more in some ways than i hoped for.  The ride and comfort of it is amazing.  the only negative i have this far would be fuel milage, but when you buy an SUV you can only expect so so milage anyway.  i also must say i get as many looks and compliments on my lincoln as any car i have driven, and i have driven many."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Robert, 08/02/2005,2006 Lincoln Navigator,5,"We tried all the SUV's but this one has them all beat. Air Conditioned seats, smoothest ride, punch from the start, Luxury like I wanted. More of what I wanted than other SUVs had to offer. Worth the extra money I spent. They really listened to the the consumer on this one."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Folk, 04/15/2006,The SUV handles well. It is swell,4,"Made well  this vehicle gets a lot of attention because there are not many on the  road  It is quiet, and handles well in the rain"
lincoln,navigator,2006,AJ, 09/05/2006,A very dissapointing experience!,3,"After 8 months no issues with drivetrain except for poor gas milage 13.1 mpg. Interior fit and finish is horrible. Excessive wind noise from drivers window. Many rattles coming from cheap plastic components such as glove box, a/c vents, 2nd row storage console, and dvd player. Quality in leather is marginal at best. Carpets are starting to show signs of wear after 10k miles. Dealer is not geared to fix these type of quality issues at their location, very frustrating. Will not purchase any Lincoln or Cadillac product again. Very nice on the surface with 0 miles, 8 months into is a different story. Looking at MB GL450, Audi Q7, will unload this Navigator at a huge loss. I hope this will help."
lincoln,navigator,2006,Jennifer, 12/12/2006,I love my Navigator!,4,"I bought my Lincoln a month ago and I love it.  Usually I have buyer's remorse with a large purchase, but not this time.  It's so comfortable and drives like a dream.  We almost bought the Luxury, but then upgraded to the Ultimate and I'm glad we did.  Its like a tank in snow and ice.  We drove over icy passes in two states two days after we bought it and its the best winter driving vehicle we've ever owned."
lincoln,navigator,2006,kc, 05/15/2007,Very nice vehicle,4,"I really love the comfort of this car. It certainly doesn't feel like you are driving a large SUV or truck. The suspension is excellent and the seats are very comfortable. The interior detail is very nice but not great.. The tan carpet shows dirt too easily and doesn't clean up well, quality to improve here. Overall, I would recommend, especially for large families.  "
lincoln,navigator,2006,Mike Rawlins, 01/19/2010,Lincoln Experience,3,"I traded in my 2000 Navigator for a new 06.  This is my 25th year to drive Lincolns and this is my last Lincoln. The truck is nice to drive and visually appealing but the fit and finish are terrible.  (2) trips to the dealer for interior repair, (3) trips for the Sirius radio repair and finally took vehicle to Visteon retailer for repair (bad unit) (1) trip to fix.  The final deal breaker was the left power fold mirror not retracting.  The truck was 34 months old and had 36,400 miles and Ford would not provide warranty repair.  I was told by the Service Manager that if the mirror glass were broken, and I had glass coverage, they could bill my insurance company.    Unbelievable!  "
lincoln,navigator,2006,mitzi, 02/01/2006,Why I love my Navigator,4,"I had a choice of any luxury SUV I would like.  I ordered this truck and had to wait as it was a special order color.  Silver Birch and with the mono tone wrap.  It is the Ultimate with every conceivable bell and whistle!!  I love it!!  It is super comfy and while the gas mileage is not a selling point, it gets within tenths of my Expedetion that preceeded it.  I did get an after market DVD as the factory one is puny i comparision.  Everyone takes a second look at this vehicle.  I'm glad I don't have a black Escalade like everyone else!!"
lincoln,navigator,2006,Anne, 07/02/2006,I love this car,4,this is my second navigator and I love it.  I do miss the arm rests that my older navigator had.
lincoln,navigator,2006,gallen, 07/31/2006,Comparisons,4,"Best luxury SUV available. Cadillac gets worse mileage and has no auto rear seats. Hummer has no a/c seats, no auto rear door and no power with poor mileage. Nothing else comes close"
lincoln,navigator,2006,This guy, 07/22/2020,Great for few miles. Poor reliability,2,"It was a great vehicle at first and absolutely loved it but not for long.  I love how comfortable it is and has good power. But then came the problems First was the panels on the seat broke off more then once then it was the air ride then the cat converter that very costly then the coils. Then a cracked exhaust manifold. Then the AC radiator rusted off, the power tailgate,then the nav. system, and now it won't even pull a hill without slowing down to about 10mph and have to really baby the throttle to get it to 50. So if you have extra money and time to burn fixing everything before you put 110,000 miles on it, it's grate but not for me."
lincoln,navigator,2007,Mastro, 12/29/2008,New Lincoln Navigator Owner,4,"Purchased our 2007 Lincoln Navigator 14 months ago. Test drove every large SUV, but Navigator blows all others away. Runs on regular gas. V8 is smooth and powerful yet the ride is amazingly smooth and quiet, you will not believe its really a truck! Massive interior space that is luxurious and comfortable. Power 3rd row folding seat is a very convenient feature which we use whenever we make runs to Lowes, Home Depot, etc. Power fold running boards have worked without any problems even through tough NJ winter. Able to handle rain, snow, and ice with confidence. Currently have over 22000 miles with impeccable dependability. Impressive vehicle that frequently receives compliments"
lincoln,navigator,2007,Shirley, 11/29/2006,Luxury rediscovered by Lincoln Finally,5,This new Navigator feels as if it is floating when driven. The interior is much more user friendly and very accommodating to ALL passengers. The sound system is almost studio quality. Sirius is definitely a plus. I love the larger DVD screen. Everything about this Navigator is top of the line.
lincoln,navigator,2007,john79, 02/22/2010,Love my NAV but it loves GAS,4,"Did a ton of research before buying and its one thing to read specs/view pics online and another to actually get into a vehicle. I was a little on the fence about front grill styling, didn't seem to have the ""wow factor"". When you actually sit and drive this SUV you will see how it simply beats out all others. I really love this truck in all aspects. If youre concerned about gas - you should be. I average 12 city/16 freeway. HOWEVER....I live in Central Texas and the weather is usually fair. If you drive with the windows down 1/4 way, with no HVAC, gas mileage shoots up to 15-16 City and 18-19 highway!! Not bad for such a large SUV."
lincoln,navigator,2007,Costa, 02/20/2016,"Reliable, big and comfortable SUV",5,"We currently have 130k miles and no major problems.  The car has been very well maintained its entire life.  The rear air suspension was a problem, but if you convert it to a normal suspension you can bypass the ongoing problems of an air suspension once it gets older.  

It is very large and comfortable and still feels like a new vehicle.  It is smooth and quite and the acceleration is good for such a large vehicle, as you would expect it does not handle like a car but I think it handles fairly well for a giant SUV.  We have the 4WD version so our MPG may not be as good as a RWD model but even still it is not bad for this size vehicle.  We average around 15 MPG in mixed driving but on highway trips it can get around 20 MPG.  It drives great on the highway in the rain.  We have never towed with it but like the fact that the tow package is cover with a plastic cover in the back bumper so you don't see the tow hitch or wires.

Even though its a 2007 I still think it looks good outside and inside, the interior does not feel dated, plus it has all the features you could want, even heated and cooled front seats.  My wife has a new smaller 3 row SUV but doesn't mind driving the Navigator and likes being a passenger in it.
"
lincoln,navigator,2007,business owner, 04/22/2008,2007 Navigator Elite,4,"I love this truck it has a lot of power. Traded in my Safari for this huge difference. Its the ultimate SUV. It has power towing and room and comfort.  I get about 13.8 in the city and 19.4 on the highway. Better then my Safari which got 12.5mpg and had a Durango Hemi that gave 7.2mpg that was insane. The interior feels like a luxury sedan. Drives like a car. Lots of legroom in the third row.  I'm 6'-2"" and I just sit fine. My family loves this SUV."
lincoln,navigator,2007,Lanis, 01/21/2008,Major upgrade from previous Navigator's,4,"When the lease on our 2002 Navigator was up, we decided to get a 2007 since the '02 had been such a reliable vehicle. Now that we have put 10,000 miles on the 2007, I can definitely say that Lincoln has moved the vehicle more upscale in terms of refinement and interior appointments. The THX audio system is unbelievable and the heated/cooled seats have come in very handy. Overall, the vehicle handles much better than the 2002 with less roll. So far, the vehicle has had no problems and is a joy to drive."
lincoln,navigator,2007,Rick T, 12/14/2006,Still the Best,4,"This is my 2nd Nav, and 5th Lincoln.  As a BIG man (nearly 400 lbs.) this vehicle offers me unsurpassed roominess and comfort.  I was thrilled with my '04 Nav, but this one rides much smoother and has some nice refinements. Although I had gotten used to the window switches being on the center console they're in a more traditional place on the doors this year.  Also the DVD player console in the back does not obstruct the rear view mirror as in the past.  The only thing that I'd like to see that it hasn't got is a cargo net behind the third row seating.  btw, 20 minutes after I drove out in my new Nav my dealer had my '04 sold!  It was still a great vehicle and served me very well.  "
lincoln,navigator,2007,david j janich, 10/20/2006,2007 Lincoln Navigator,4,"outstanding refinement. very smooth and quiet. if they offered a higher powered option i would have ordered it. after trying a couple of the competitors, i went for the Lincoln and besides it is an American vehicle so the profits stay in our country."
lincoln,navigator,2007,mike zavala, 11/25/2006,navi 2000,5,"I think this has always been the best biggest suv. Lincoln has done a great job, this suv turns heads. This suv has a smooth ride."
lincoln,navigator,2007,Steve S, 12/19/2006,"A ""BIG"" Step Up",5,Ford has real winner this year with its '07 Navigator.  Cadillac fans are even taking notice and believe it or not...switching! The ride is better and so is the handling.  Maybe a little less power but well worth giving up the extra power for the remaining assets.
lincoln,navigator,2007,dtipainter, 03/19/2008,2007 Licoln Navigator L,2,"After owning the car for 9 months, I have few suggestions for improvement: The A/C cooled seats don't have enough cooling power on hot days.  You can't even tell if they are operating if it is above 90 outside. The center console is very very busy.  It is very difficult to find controls while driving for specific actions because there are so many buttons, I am 6'-3"" tall and for me the vehicle has a very bad blind spot.  I have almost moved over on other vehicles several times. Back up sensors are nice, but a backup camera option would have been nice."
lincoln,navigator,2007,325ic745iNavi, 10/02/2006,3rd Navi,5,"'07 Navi may have some styling flaws (gauge array) but otherwise gets a bad rap.  Far superior to Escalade in interior and build quality (real wood, tight fitments, etc.,).  I want a quiet, safe (side airbags, not avail on Escalade) ride, not a hopped up plastic pimped out ride that's so loud I can't hear myself think."
lincoln,navigator,2007,dude, 12/20/2006,best suv ever,4,This suv draws a lot of attention I get all kinds of compliments of how good it looks.I love the smooth ride with little wind noise at high speed. this is one beautiful truck.
lincoln,navigator,2007,longtime Nav owner, 02/03/2007,Another step downward,3,"As a previous 2004 Nav owner and a 2001 Nav owner and a 1998 Nav owner, I certainly have a solid perspective on trends in the Nav's design. I am sorely disappointed by changes to the 2007 model. All of the reviews talk about the spaciousness of the interior. They have definitely downsized the interior, lowering the height of the headliner. All of the exterior chrome certainly went past tacky. I was also positively spoiled by the huge sideview mirrors in the 2004 model. I'm sorry to see those downsized too.  Probably the only positive changes are the redesigned power running boards."
lincoln,navigator,2007,07NAVIBOY, 10/30/2006,Best Navigator yet,5,"I have been a dedicated Cadillac man until now!  This 07 Navigator has the Escalade beat all around!  Looks, quality, luxury, comfort, performance...the Escalade just can't equal this 07 Navigator! The build quality is superb, the ride and quiet is the best I have ever experienced in a SUV, handling and responsiveness is excellent.  Congrats to Lincoln! I love my 07 Navigator!  "
lincoln,navigator,2007,Anthony T, 01/06/2007,The Ultimate,4,I am a previous Navigator owner.  Looked to downsize for better fuel economy. Once I sat in the 2007 it was all over. The comfort and ride can't be beat. 
lincoln,navigator,2007,Robbie, 07/23/2007,Nav L extended,5,"Thourghly enjoy comfort & quiet ride.  Additional length is a life saver as we travel a lot and wife likes at least four suitcases.  Traveling for the gospel across the country is convenient, fun and comfortable.  Have put over 12K miles since mid Jan, and expect another 10K by year end.  Same engine as previous Nav, but better gas mileage using regular gas.  Am getting 18.5 on hwy, 14.8 in town...I can deal with that.  Absolutely love it!!!"

lincoln,navigator,2007,Tops Escalade, 10/15/2006,Amazingly better!,4,"Purchased it last month. Since have put on almost 1,000 miles. Rides very nice and handles the road better than any escalade i have owned. The comfort and features are out of this world. Styling is different, but very static. Besides that it's a Ford and they really took a big step up making this suv!"
lincoln,navigator,2007,jimyboy, 11/21/2006,very outstanding,5,I think that this is one of the nicest best riding cars i have ever even been in.  i have realized that owning this car also brings much attention to me. I was parked next to a new escalade one day and a group of kids walked by looked at the escalade once and then stared at the navigator for quite some time. I believe that you cannot go wrong with this vehicle.
lincoln,navigator,2007,avi79, 03/08/2007,luxury and solid suv of all time,5,happy fun to drive. drives really sooth on roads. it feels like you're driving in a airplane because it feels like you're touching the ground
lincoln,navigator,2007,angel, 04/15/2007,Navigator,4,"I love everything about the Navigator so far .The navigation system is easy to use and understandable, so is the rear seat DVD. The ride quality and quietness is exceptional even with this 20'' wheels. The quality of the materials and the luxury it offers swallows you into this incredible vehicle. The power step assist are great, nice touch and just about everything this car has to offer was well though out, planned, and executed to produce the 2007 Lincoln Navigator, an amazing full size SUV. "
lincoln,navigator,2007,jakebank, 04/03/2007,One Sweet Ride,4,Just bought this car new and we absolutely love it. It has every single option that is available and it is a well designed vehicle.  The interior cannot be beat. Compared to the Escalade and the Infiniti QX56 the interior if far superior. Good performance and adequate gas mileage for a vehicle this big. Everyone takes a second look at you when you're driving this thing. We got the white chocolate paint and its beautiful. Excellent car and I would reccomend it to anyone.
lincoln,navigator,2007,NavRick, 06/30/2007,Best of the Lux SUVs,4,"I tested them all, and being a minivan guy, all the new SUVs had shortcomings. The Navigator had the most pluses with the least minuses. I wanted smooth, quiet, luxury, and functionality, and I believe I got it! This is my first SUV, my biggest hurdle was getting over the fact that while these vehicles are much larger than my Sienna minivan, they all have much less interior space, storage and functionality. That said, the family wanted to change and we are very happy with the purchase."
lincoln,navigator,2007,BigBill, 08/01/2007,Almost Perfect,4,"Very comfortable and quiet ride. The roomiest cabin ever. Love folding seats and running boards. Excellent navigation system and very good sound system. I own BMW 750i and I have to admit - Navigator is indeed roomy and comfortable. Towing is effortless, but I'm really dissappointed with lack or the rear view camera on 2007 model. Fuel economy is not bad at all - 14 city and 20.6 freeway. I've never managed to achieve this on my Jeep with Hemi engine."
lincoln,navigator,2007,Phil Thompson, 09/23/2006,Canada SUV,3,"Dealership service has been good.  This vehicle is huge, smooth and very reliable for driving in the mixed Northern weather. The main problem is the very poor gas mileage."
lincoln,navigator,2007,elmview, 11/11/2006,Navigator,4,I just got my new Navigator and find that is nice improvement over the previous model. It has almost all the features that I was looking for. the exterior styling looks fresh.
lincoln,navigator,2007,Drew, 01/13/2008,Big Lincoln,3,This is a great truck. Easy to drive taking into consideration its size. I don't think I could ever go back to a car  
lincoln,navigator,2008,Gaelon Ball, 02/12/2016,Amazing 08 Navigator,5,"I bought my Navigator a few months ago and about a month after buying it we were in a 5 car collision  on the interstate my navigator came out of the wreck with a dented bumper that's it... IT SAVED MY FAMILY'S LIVES INCLUDING THE 8 MONTH TWINS IN THE 3RD ROW.... you could never get a better vehicle and gas mileage it pretty great considering its an SUV with a big V8.I love my navigator it's alot better than my 2000 expedition Eddie Bauer! This vehicle saved my family's lives on multiple occasions since I bought it, if you are in a position to get a Lincoln Navigator do so you will not regret it, it is a fantastic traveling and local vehicle, the best part is that you don't have to have premium fuel.... For someone who's had the LINCOLN  experience you will not regret buying...! 
(Update ... I have now had my 2008 Lincoln Navigator for almost 2 years now and is is the most fantastic vehicle I have ever owned I recently hit a deer a 40 mph and it only cracked the bumper and the grill which the insurance covered but I was completely shocked there wasn't ALOT more damage but that's it the brakes immediately responded it didn't slide or screach nothing it was amazing. I can go on and on at how great this car has been but to put it simply I would definitely buy another!!!)
"
lincoln,navigator,2008,kev, 07/16/2009,Great travel vehicle,4,I bought this 6 months ago.  it took a few weeks to get the hang of driving it.  now I love it.  Plenty of power.  Really comfortable.  Tons of room for a 220 lb 6 footer like me.  just drove 3400 miles in two weeks on vacation with tons of gear and bicycles on the back.  made the trip very easy.  17.9 MPG on trip.  about 15 commuting to work and around town.  many really nice features
lincoln,navigator,2008,TRS, 03/21/2009,Best One Yet,4,"This is my third Navigator. All have been 2 year leases. I intend to buy this one at lease end. My first two had some electrical problems, especially with the easy exit system. This one been back once to replace the rear dvd, but other than that no problems. I love to drive this vehicle, especially on road trips. Gas mileage is low, but to be expected for a car this size. I really love the backup camera where it is in the reaeview mirror as it keeps sun glare to a minimum, whereas in dash cameras have that problem. Perfect family vehicle. The olny thing that keeps this car from being perfect is blue tooth. "
lincoln,navigator,2008,azt1, 01/13/2012,Comfortable and Roomy.,4,I've had my Navigator for a few months now. I was leasing a 2008 GMC Yukon Denali before I decided to buy. I originally bought a 2007 Cadillac Escalade but took it back because it was too much like the Denali. The Escalade does handle better and has more power than the Nav but I do like the Navs interior a bit better. Love the 3rd row seat and the power fold feature. Denali and Escalade 3rd row was terrible. Also like that the Nav can switch from 2W to 4W drive. Denali and Escalade was AWD. Nav takes Regular Fuel while Denali and Escalade took Premium Fuel. Overall I am satisfied with the Nav though there is room to improve on it to better compete with other luxury brands.

lincoln,navigator,2008,W. Melgin, 08/16/2008,Love my Navigator,4,I was going to buy an Infiniti QX56 but it was too tall for our garage. I love this Lincoln in all respects. It has almost everything I need and the comfort and drivability is unmatched.
lincoln,navigator,2008,Laura, 11/28/2008,Luv It,5,"Love it! This is the most comfortable car I have ever been in.  When my friends and I go out their Hondas and BMWs stay home and we take my Navigator becuase it's the most comfortable of all of our cars. I love that it never goes back to the dealership. My old Mercedes G500 spent more time at the dealer than with me so this is a wonderful improvement. My husband tells me that my Navigator is based on the same vehicle as his Expedition and he puts over 150,000 miles on them with no problems. I look forward to keeping my car for a long time."
lincoln,navigator,2008,bal, 08/24/2009,Nice SUV,4,This car is an overall good vehicle. It has room for 7 passengers which makes it convenient for families with children. The car is very large and takes a little bit to get used to if you haven't driven an SUV before. The sound system is great. Very reliable and well built. The only problem we had was an electrical one with the window which was fixed under warranty.
lincoln,navigator,2008,Angel R., 07/26/2007,Lincoln Navigator,4,"Rides like a cloud. Smooth ride and handling. Practically no interior noise and wind noise is minimal to none even at highway speeds. Performance is quite good for a vehicle its size. Comfort is excellent. Cup holders and compartments are well placed through out the vehicle and so on. Exterior design is not its strongest point, but overall has an excellent appeal with the 20' wheels and its unique grille design. I would definitely recomend this vehicle and would probably purchase another at some point . "
lincoln,navigator,2008,Jennifer C, 02/16/2020,Love my Navigator!,5,"I got into large SUV's when I purchase my first Ford Expedition.  I owned two of those and then upgraded to the Lincoln Navigators.  I had a 2004 for several years, sold it to a relative and then purchased a 2008 Navigator two years ago...it was a true cream puff with only 74k miles and I purchased an extended warranty for it.  So far I have only had to replace the back AC actuator which was covered by the warranty.  I recently took it in for an oil change and my mechanic said it is in perfect condition....a 12 year old vehicle...I love this thing.  It is comfortable, gets 17- 19 mpg on the highway which is awesome for a large SUV.  I tow a 20' Seadoo boat with it, handles like nothing is behind it.  The only down side on mine is, no bluetooth and original owner before me didn't put in a back up camera because they purchased it to tow a camper, so didn't need one.  So we use a bluetooth adapter and a wireless back up camera on it.  Ours holds 8 people so it is great for when the family comes for holidays...as we can fit everybody comfortably even with toddler seats...It is built like a tank and I have no doubt if I was ever in an accident, it would protect me and my family.  My 2004 used Premium fuel, so I am glad the 2008 went to using regular gas...saves at the pump.  Since the newer ones cost as much as a house...I plan to keep this one til the tires come off...then will seek out one a few years newer...Lincoln knows how to build an SUV...will never try anything else.  Between my two Lincoln Navigator purchases, I tried a used Buick Enclave...had it in the shop more than I drove it for engine and transmission fluttering issues which were never resolved...after one year, I got rid of it.  Will stick with Lincoln from now on...

lincoln,navigator,2008,sevenstw, 06/04/2009,Luxury Built Ford Tough,4,"The exterior chrome and square gauges have a retro 1960s look.  The interior is all about comfort, luxury and modern technology.  Build quality is excellent compared to the competition. For someone who drives nothing but full sized V8 trucks, I was impressed with the gas mileage and power of the Navigator. The seats are very comfortable and there is all kinds of leg, side and head room in all 3 rows."
lincoln,navigator,2008,jnd, 09/07/2008,Solid in every way,4,"This is our second Navigator and this is much better then the 2005 model we replaced. Recently towed a 7500 lb boat and had the vehicle packed for  vacation, trip was 120 miles each way and averaged 11 mpg. Handled the trailer like a champ. This model is significantly quiter then the model it replaces and seems smaller even though it is the same size. Engine and drive train are the same as the 2005 but the 2008 uses regular gas. Plenty of room for passengers and gear and the 3rd row seats are very comfortable even for large adults. The high itensity headlights are not as bright as the 2005 but the coverage is very good. "
lincoln,navigator,2008,08navi, 09/22/2007,Excellent Ride,4,This is our second Navigator(2004) and the best one overall that we have had. The monotone option is a must if you find the extensive chrome too much. The leather is much nicer than our '04 was and the '08 is a lot quieter.  Interior quality is significantly better than the Escalade.
lincoln,navigator,2008,David, 10/06/2007,Better Than Expected,4,"This is our 2nd version of the Navigator. Our previous was a 2004 and this model is definitely improved. We have a 2007 Escalade as well and except for the larger rear view camera and more powerful engine on the Escalade, the Navigator beats it in all other areas."

I love the Expedition. There was more leg room in the second row and more head room in the 1st and 2nd rows. I miss my big cubby hole I had in the console since the gear shifter was on the column."
lincoln,navigator,2008,mercedesamg17, 06/27/2007,My Review,4,The navigator is a very sharp looking car. Thank God it doesn't look like the Expedition because that is very ugly! Overall great car that is fun to drive and is truly luxury.
lincoln,navigator,2008,TroyD75826, 05/06/2008,New impression,4,I am very happy with my new Navigator. It is very comfortable and the build quality is just as good as any other luxury vehicle.  Power is more than adequate but on paper is a little wimpy when compared to the Escalade.
lincoln,navigator,2009,Big Jim, 11/26/2009,The SUV I've been waiting for!!,4,"I have owned and driven GM, Chrysler and most recently a 2004 Expedition Eddie Bauer.  Each of these has lacked something significant to make the driving experience perfect.  I just bought the used 09 Navigator and drove it home (850 miles).  I got 16.5 mpg at 73mph plus some town driving.  That mpg is what I used to get in my AWD Town and Country.  This vehicle is the epitome of the SUV.  I have driven the new cross overs including the Lincoln MKT.  Nothing rides like the Navigator, or feels like the Navigator.  I will update as the ownwership process continues."
lincoln,navigator,2009,Nav School Bus, 06/12/2009,Great second Nav,4,I love my 2009 Navigator and this is a huge improvement over my 2006 Navigator that was a very good car.  There are a number of improvements that make this a pleasure to drive.  The truck is fully loaded with all options and I think the build quality is superior.  I leased my 2006 and when the lease expired I was going to buy because I liked it so much but thye were practically giving away new cars.  There is not a thing I would change other than the fuel efficiency.  Third row is a true third row and comfortably fits adults.
lincoln,navigator,2009,halfin1965, 10/15/2009,Why did I even look at an Escalade?,4,"I was ready to purchase an Escalade, but poor treatment at the Cadillac dealer and GMAC's games on the 0% financing caused me to look elsewhere. After Mercedes, Lexus and Audi, Lincoln was my last visit.  (I was trading in a 2007 GX470 - nice car, too small) The Navigator is a little uglier in the front than the Escalade and does not have the ""auto-start"" feature the Cadillac has.  Other than those two items the Lincoln is FAR superior.  In addition the COOLED front seats eliminate the need for auto start here in HOT Texas.  (They also let me have the two tone black insert leather seats -available on the Limited Edition with no concerns of ""sweaty back"" on hot days.  Just a superior vehicle."
lincoln,navigator,2009,aboammar, 05/10/2009,Very Nice SUV!!,4,"Looking at the photos on the net for the 2009 Navigator, I totally disliked it .. it even looked ugly to my eye!!  I was 100% sure to go with the Expedition, but after seeing it last night, and test driving it, I changed my mind 100%, and bought it right a way!!  The Navigator looks much much better in person than in photos!!  I think it is not photogenic :)  The only things I dislike about it are: 1- The tail lights looks bad, and dose not match the overall nice look of the car.  I am still looking for after-market LED tail light to replace it. 2-  Exhaust pipe looks very ugly!! 3-  Bad sound system espically in the 2nd and 3rd row seats. "
lincoln,navigator,2010,Warren, 07/23/2010,Sweet Ride for my 5 girls.,4,"This is the best large SUV for the money.  I'm 6'1"", and I can sit comfortably in the 3rd row.  Plus the seats fold flat.  The competition simply could not measure up to that.  Sync is awesome.  Bluetooth phone just works and the voice navigation system is very nice.  For the most part, the interior is first rate, with nice leather throughout. It's a very nice car slathered in luxury, and the best value in it's class, and I'm glad made the purchase."
lincoln,navigator,2010,ander580, 12/05/2009,We love our 2010 Navigator,4,"We needed an SUV to replace our minivan.  We considered the Infiniti QX56, Yukon Denali, and Ford Expedition.  We bought the Navigator because it had every feature we wanted, including fold flat seats, front and rear parking sensors, air conditioned seats, and roomy third row seat. The ownership experience to date has been fabulous.  This is definitely the best vehicle we've had.  It tows our boat well and the cabin is a quiet comfort zone.  My wife and I both want to drive it - that's the only problem so far."
lincoln,navigator,2010,brian selai, 03/29/2016,"Wasn't too bad until the 5.4 ""death rattle""",4,"Bought the vehicle certified used in 2012. Wife happy with vehicle until last month. 140,000 miles and engine dropped a cylinder. Apparently the 5.4 triton has a bad reputation for this. After several hundred dollars in palliative attempts, it was recommended by a Ford garage to just replace the engine due to its reputation. Only other issues were the running boards needed serviced at about 80,000 miles, the air blender occasionally makes the rattle related to plastic teeth failure. Headlamps are pricey to replace also plan on several hundred when they fail. Another issue should be the limited illumination of the high beams. Really no better than regular headlamps. Not convinced we would buy another.

lincoln,navigator,2010,t, 11/19/2015,A money looser,3,"Glad we purchased this used a 2010 in 2013. at that time it had already lost $ 30,000 from it's original value.

it is now 2015 and we found out it lost another $ 10,000 in value from date of our purchase...So if you want to loose $ 40,000 in value for a vehicle in less than 6 full years go ahead and throw your money away. We will be purchasing a Toyota which holds it's value a lot better than this Lincoln.
This vehicle, on the other hand is a great towing vehicle for our 34' Travel trailer, and did great in our last 2 winters of heavy snow here in norther Indiana where we get lake effect snow. We have had about $ 2,000 in repairs  out of our pocket since purchasing, (bad brakes, battery, oil leak, computer problems) some were covered with the ""ford certified"" some where NOT. We won't waste our money on a certified car again.  The car had 46,000 miles when we purchased it and they had never replaced the brake pads! The MPG is a lot better than we had hoped for at 16 city/20 highway

lincoln,navigator,2010,Brandy Brown, 06/23/2020,5.4 is a money pit.,2,"I bought a used 2010 navigator in 2020, the price was right at $12,500, the car had 90,000 miles on it. I LOVE this car, its luxury and practicality wrapped in one... And I wish I'd never bought it. 4 months into owning it the engine blew up, I now owe $10,000 on a car that I can trade in for $1,000 or dump $5,000 into for a new engine. I bought an engine from a junkyard and had it put in and the mechanic said quite flatly ""sell this car ASAP because these engines are known for blowing up and you'll be doing this again in another 50,000 miles"" super disappointed in my purchase, wish I would've kept my silverado.

lincoln,navigator,2010,natzhawk, 11/08/2010,Poor plastic,3,I had to give the interior a poor rating.  Due to the fact that the speaker's plastic is very poor.  Just wiping the plastic can mess up the plastic's color.  The driving of the vehicle is smooth and the comfort level is good.  
lincoln,navigator,2010,iceout, 12/05/2009,A great luxury SUV,4,"A test ride was all it took for me to sign the papers and drive off with my new Lincoln Navigator.  What a great comfortable ride with good performance, handling and a very quiet ride.   The fuel millage is the same as the Mercury mountaineers that I have previously leased which is amazing for a larger heavier vehicle.  The forward and rear sensing systems in the bumper and a rear view camera make it real easy to park. A truly great vehicle."
lincoln,navigator,2010,MVotaw, 06/07/2010,Lots of potential,3,"I really enjoy my Lincoln.  From the front, it's a great looking vehicle with lots of power.  That said, the back end looks like a cracker box.  Interior is very comfortable, but you can't read the dash in sunlight and there is little leg room in the back.  The back glass opens by itself and lets rain / debris run into the cargo area.  I've had $5000 worth of warranty done on the truck and the service was fantastic.  The interior is very cheap looking and scuffs easily in addition to being a bear to navigate all the buttons.  Overall though a very nice vehicle."
lincoln,navigator,2011,Kevin, 07/09/2017,Take flight!!,5,"The truck is not great on gas but should a truck that comfortably sits 8, be good on gas?  The interior cabin is flawless. You can ask for more, electric folding 3rd row seats heated and air-conditioned seats for the front and back. So much leg room for passengers even in the 3rd row. The power step railing makes it easy to get in out and look really cool doing it. The entertainment system insane. Bluetooth connectivity flawless, USB ports, aux input all put clever places. The pedals and steering adjust to the driver. It's rides like a dream!!  I love this truck.

I have no problems accessing and using all of the Navi's features with ease.
The THX sound system, Navigation system and Sync capabilities are also excellent.

Highway, suburban and city driving is easy, comfortable and enjoyable.

lincoln,navigator,2011,suv15, 11/11/2011,2011 Navigator 4x4,4,"This is our first Lincoln Navigator after owning 3 Ford Expeditions.
Our Navigator is White Platinum Metallic Tri-Coat.
The color shows very little dirt.

After putting 200,000 miles on our last 2005 Expedition (and it was still going strong), we upgraded to a Navigator.
With 4500 miles on our new Navigator, we hope this SUV proves as ""Ford tough"" as previous Expeditions.

We very much enjoy our Navigator, and have absolutely no buyers remorse.
However being very pleased with three Expeditions (the last being an Expedition Limited), I am not certain the ""Lincoln"" brand is worth the additional cost.
However, the Lincoln Navigator definitely turns more heads than a Ford Expedition."
lincoln,navigator,2011,Tim Scholz, 11/03/2010,Our 2nd Navigator,4,We love the feel and drive of the car. We had a 2000 Navigator and that is why we purchased the 2011.

lincoln,navigator,2011,phillip_g, 03/12/2015,Really enjoy it!,4,"This is not a sports car nor is it a hybrid-if that is what you are wanting this is NOT the vehicle for you. It is a luxury, truck-based SUV...Its BIG...very comfortable, hauls a lot of your closest friends and family and 9000 pounds if you need it to. Not as hard to park as Edmunds would lead you to believe, actually has a great turning radius. With the Front and Rear parking sensors and back up cam you should have no issue with parking unless your trying to land in a ""compact only"" space. We had a 2006 Model and had no major issues with it other than normal wear-Very happy with the choice we made to purchase this one-Lincoln Certified Program is excellent. "
lincoln,navigator,2011,lincolndude1, 03/03/2011,Headrests need to go back to the 2006 version.,3,"Recently traded a 2006 Navigator for a 2010 model. The ride is very smooth and handling around corners is fine. As Edmunds has stated, sometimes the transmission can't seem to find the right gear.
 The biggest complaint is the driver's and front passenger's headrests are way too hard causing this driver a headache. The 2006 Navigator had just the right headrest as it was more adjustable being able to pivot forward as well as up and down and was more cushioned. The 2010 can only move up and down with hardly any cushion. It's hard to understand why auto manufacturers don't stick with a good thing once it's created."
lincoln,navigator,2011,dlewis3494, 06/12/2011,2011 Lincoln Navigator Limited Edition,4,"I really like the vehicle.
It super comfortable to drive.
The one let down I have found is that it only has a single disc CD/DVD player.
I would have thought a
luxuary car would have a 6 disc player.
Quality is some of the best I have seen but some of the SYNC/Navigation system is taking a while to learn.
I have had 4 trucks with the SYNC before this one and this one is different. Some of this high tech stuff is hard for us older folks to learn, but the comfort is there."

lincoln,navigator,2011,Chuck Campbell, 11/27/2018,Nicest F-150 I've ever owned!,4,"It's a Lincoln Navigator, of course, but it has a lot in common with the F-150, starting with its 5.4 liter V-8. It's a very comfortable car for long drives. It tows my 21' RV trailer with ease. With the seats down, it accommodates about as much cargo as my 2003 F-150 shortbed did, but with more security. The car has electrically operated drop-down running boards that make it easy to get in and out. Fuel economy is about what you'd expect--pretty close to the 14 city/18 highway sticker rating. It got 19+ on our most recent trip on 2-lane highways, but the mileage drops to 8-10 when towing the RV. I bought the car when it was 6 model years old with 59K miles--for about a third of its original sticker price. In the two years I've owned it, it has required only two repairs besides normal maintenance, one to replace a heater hose assembly and the other also to the heater, which wasn't giving off heat. I've put 19K miles on it and plan to keep it for a long time.
"
lincoln,navigator,2011,E Walker, 10/15/2020,Ages like fine wine....expensive fine wine,4,"I still own my 2011 Lincoln Navigator. At 165,000 miles, its aged pretty well. Ebony and chrome exterior and ebony leather interior. I've kept mine very clean and since there aren't a whole lot of them out there, it stands out. It still rides excellent; its quiet, the interior has held up pretty good, and its got enough power to get the job done. I recently took a trip to Chicago with my family and drive 500 miles to get there. Right now, I'm moving into a new house and there's so much space that I have not had to rent a U-Haul truck yet. Since owning it, I've gotten the windows tinted and upgraded the sound system bypassing the factory amp, adding an equalizer, amplifying the speakers, and added another subwoofer. I also like that its Flex Fuel capable which I've used. You get a bit more performance, but AWFUL gas mileage and the flex fuel doesn't start well in cold weather. It also drives extremely well in rain and snow. You will never get suck using the 4X4

The downside is that repairs on this truck are VERY EXPENSIVE. I had a 3rd party warranty that covered my air suspension and one of my running boards. The other running board failed outside of the warranty and it was $1500 to fix. My remote start malfunctioned and it cost me $1000 to fix. My sunroof needed to be replaced and that was $2500. I replaced the seat module myself for about $50. Now granted, I got all of my work done at the Lincoln Dealership so I know the labor was the main expense, but many smaller shops would not touch it. Also, the infotainment system has not aged well. It does have Bluetooth and the navigation has 2019 maps, but no apple car play or android car play, the interface is very bland, and trying to use the voice commands to program an address for my navigation is cumbersome (the Sync 3 system is much better). Also, while the 12 speaker THX system is nice on paper, the factory sub is weak and the volume turns down over time hence me adding an equalizer, bypassed the factory amp to amplify the speakers, and added an additional subwoofer. Finally, like most vehicles in the Midwest, it is very susceptible to rust, especially under the running boards. While most of the frame is in really good shape, there are signs of rust. 

All in all, this truck is amazing! I still get compliments on it when I go out and people think its a new truck. Its comfortable, luxurious, I can haul people and items, and even though once in a while things will break down and break the bank, keeping up with maintenance and repairs will keep your Navigator running for a long time.

This vehicle is FAR above any of the prior mentioned.  The performance is not like the Cadillac but the ride and drive more that makes up for it.  Very roomy and comfortable for long trips. I have the ""L"" series.  Presently the vehicle just turned over 105K  it has NEVER been to the dealer.  The only issue I have ever experienced was drivers window regulator which I purchased from the local auto parts store for $89.00 and repaired myself.

lincoln,navigator,2012,Mo Blackwater, 03/06/2015,Nothing larger or smoother for the dollar,4,"Versus the Cadillac, first you save $20K when optioned out off the dealers lot, that's quite a bit. Second, you can put the Lincoln in 2 wheel drive, giving you better gas mileage and a better ride. Third, you get an independent rear suspension, with the L, long wheel base, nothing rides smoother in this class, period.  A Suburban rides like a base pick-up on a gravel road, my previous vehicle.  Fourth, the seats don't need to be pulled out (third row).  Not only are they roomier, the fold right into the floor.  I am a large guy, the third seat is a pain to get out of a GM vehicle.  My 5.4 drove over Colorado at 10K feet altitude with plenty of passing power.  Love the truck @ 48,000 miles!"

You will have to put money into a used truck so by spending less and getting the Navigator you will have more to spend to fix up your new used truck! Best to buy one that you can get an extended warranty. It's well worth it. Within the first year of owning this Navigator, I had to spend around 5000.00 in repairs after only putting on 4000.00 miles. It drives fantastic but it will cost you!

lincoln,navigator,2012,Niddy, 11/19/2016,Expedition on steroids,4,"Only complaint is the tech package and dash and the instruments are old looking like almost trying to be retro.  The new version really didn't change anything except the controls and dash.  Much nicer now.  Not a deal killer as the car drives and rides great.  It's comfortable and fits all the gear.  Stereo is great, a/c and heated seats, all add to the likability.  Only other caution I'd throw out is auto running boards.  If you forget about them, you may walk in to them as they deploy and forget about them as they come out and bruise your shins.

lincoln,navigator,2014,primodel, 12/08/2013,Super Comfortable,5,"This my 3rd Navigator, 1998, 2003 and 2014.
I am super pleased with the 2014 model.
Comfort for me is priority #1.
I tested several other models in the same price range and the Navigator came out on top.
For a big unit like this it rides extremenly well.
Gas cost at $3.40 a gallon represents a weekly cost of $11.00 in fuel vs 17mpg on any other vehicle.
I am willing to pay the extra $11.00 a week for this SUV.
The only mechanical problem was the A\C unit that had to be replaced nov 2019.  As of today I stand by my review(dec2019).

lincoln,navigator,2015,Phil Calendine, 10/09/2015,Traded '14 ESV for the L and loving it!,4,"Yes, we had a brand new 2014 Cadillac ESV Platinum. It was really crap. Transmission issues, electrical issues, upgraded seats were horrible, very uncomfortable. Ride was very poor compared to our previous air suspension 2003 ESV. Engine under powered. Vented seats sounded like a jet landing in the car. Heated/cooled cup holder worked great for the two minutes before it turned itself off. Remote start worked great as far away as five feet. 2015 Cadillac is just plain ugly and ""fold flat"" seats simply sit up on floor of car...wife literally couldn't reach into car without hitting the bumper. That's not gonna work in Ohio winters. 

So we decided to cut our losses and try the Navigator-L. Got a fantastic deal on the outgoing 2015 which is essentially same as the new 2016. I did like the general appearance of the ESV platinum interior better, but the functionality of the Nav over the '14 or '16 ESV is way, way better. The entertainment/nav is infinitely easier and more intuitive than the grossly antiquated non Vue system we had in the '14, and I feel much better than the Vue system in the latest Caddy. Unlike the Vue, Lincoln maintains hard buttons where it makes it easier to use (volume, tuning, HVAC, etc) but still integrates those into its Sync system. The iPhone works seamlessly and intuitively. 

The old Nav had a grossly underpowered engine. The new ecoboost turbo rectifies that, and easily outperforms the '14 or '16 ESV. In addition, this smart 6 cylinder gets about 15% better gas mileage, which, comcined with the 33 gal tank vs 28 on the ESV, and you can go way further.  The brakes are also much improved, and better compared to Caddy. The ride (we have the upgraded Reserve edition with comparable air suspension) has 3 very useful and noticeably different ride selections. The Sport setting is great around town, resulting in a very stable, nearly sway free ride. Hit the highway and select comfort and the road bumps are nearly unnoticeable. The ESV did neither. 

The back of the L has much easier to use auto down third row, which, by the way is 40/60 split, which means you can actually sit someone in the middle of the back row. Caddy 50/50 split resulted in our huge ESV being reduced functionally to a six passenger! Who wants to sit in a crack? 

So overall, from my perspective, the '15 or '16 Nav L is an easy winner over Caddy, which gives the feel of an over confident underachiever.

UPDATE: April 2017 at 22k miles. 
I suppose with an American car it was inevitable. What was initially a tight, smooth ride has slowly but noticeably deteriorated into a sway wagon. We had to have the reader wiper motor replaced, thank goodness right before warranty set to expire. The driver side power foot board is now angled outward, probably from an overweight service person that worked on our car, and the dealership sees nothing wrong with it. We get random beeping from the park assist all the time, and Lincoln has been zero help. Gas mileage has dropped as well, though still 1-2 mpg greater than we ever got with the ESV. It is still comfortable enough, and nothing else compares as far as gross load hauling of people and stuff, but we can't wait until we can offload this thing and get a Lexus.

lincoln,navigator,2015,James, 02/09/2016,Great value great service,5,"I have a 2015 Select Navigator L. Bought this truck in November of 2014 before the dealer had any on display in the lot and still got a great deal. Service has been very good. A year after buying the car I asked about replacing a seat cover that had a slight factory defect (wrinkle) I  noticed when new but not till after purchase and bothered me over time. They did the right thing and replaced the seat cover under warranty
] to the tune of about $1200. Probably I'm lucky to have a good dealer but not all manufacturers would oblige me this way after the sale I'm sure. Like a previous review said this is a very nicely powered great riding and functional suv. I have had no issues and it tows my boat on vacations like it's not even there. Surprisingly easy to maneuver for such a large truck. It's so big I have to park it diagonally in my 3 car garage but bliss alleviates the need for hanging a tennis ball. The main thing is everything works well and I think Lincoln did a good job of updating with mature tried and true 6 speed transmission,  ecoboost engine and bug free navigation. Voice command works well and features like nearby movie theatres and show times is really nice. Not super fast and interface is a little complicated but ultimately rewarding
 Bluetooth and hd radio sound best on the THX audio system.The platform doesn't allow for some of the newer features like adaptive cruise but I find incrementing the speed using the steering wheel buttons works well on trips and I don't have to worry about the car slamming on the brakes when passing a semi like I've read is happening with other manufactures who have bugs in their advanced electronics. Has all the nice luxury features I need like power everything (steering column, pedals, folding seats and heated and cooled seats standard. This truck is exceptionally quick, smooth, and roomy, and CAPABLE. Fit and finish is pretty good but not as good as like and escalade but then this is much less expensive and much nicer looking than the expeditions interior in my opinion. I like to research and am glad I bought this over its domestic rivals due to all the problems they are having with their all new designs which I think are too small inside and not advanced enough in their mechanical engineering which is where I think Ford has a leg up on the competition.

lincoln,navigator,2015,Texas Big Mike, 01/14/2018,"Great road car, technological nightmare",3,"I've owned the car for 4 1/2 years and have put 62,000 miles on it. It's a wonderful road car, with a solid feel, good acceleration from the turbocharged V6, and a surprisingly good 18-19 mpg on the highway. The seats are comfortable and the deploying running board makes it easy to enter and exit, important since my wife has had major back surgery. The cargo space is huge; we traveled with a 90 lb Lab and luggage for several weeks at a time and have lots of space. The instrument panel is easily readable and intuitive, and the hands free operation is convenient and adds to road safety. Here's the downside: despite numerous trips to the dealer, several of which involved 3-4 day stays, the car's electronic package still malfunctions frequently. It tells me it there's no key in the vehicle sometimes and won't start, sometimes giving the signal when the car is running and under way; the proximity sensors go off for no reason, the automatic windshield wipers turn on under perfectly dry conditions, and sometimes the Bluetooth phone connection does not recognize my phone. The problems are not constant nor have they interfered with the operation of the vehicle or it's safety, but it's annoying and undermines my confidence in the vehicle. Despite my satisfaction with the car's handling I may not buy another one.

lincoln,navigator,2015,risenbeck, 12/20/2016,"Compared all of the luxury SUV's, Navigator won",5,"I car shopped for about 1 month for a new SUV.  Test drove Suburban, Mercedes GL450, Escalade, Lexus and Navigator.  I was looking for a 15' model to keep price in the high 30's to low 60's.  The one I liked best would win our regardless of price.  I ended up picking the Navigator as it's ride was so much nicer than all the others.  Now that I had the car for a week, I am enjoying other features like great sound system, easy to use panels that parse off navigation, entertainment, climate, etc.  Also key was being able to seat normal sized people in the 3rd row if we needed it.  The Lexus was so high priced, but also only a kid would be able to sit in the 3rd row as it was not deep enough for legs.  Also another great feature was the ability of the back to flatten out completely with a push of a button.  The look of the car is also very nice (black on black).  I am very happy with this purchase as I almost completely forgot about the Navigator.

lincoln,navigator,2015,Gary Kirkwood, 01/02/2018,Beautiful Vehicle,5,"The Navigator is a beautiful vehicle to own and to drive.  Obviously because of the size of the vehicle, fuel economy is not the best but really not too bad.  Comfort is amazing and so is he ride.  There is plenty of room in this vehicle for just about anything.  Towing capabilities are  wonderful and stopping if towing is above average.  If you are going to be in an area where there is snow, I truly recommend getting this vehicle with 4 wheel drive.  Have had no problems with the vehicle and I must say that with the twin turbos this large vehicle really gets up and moves.  The navigation system gets a little getting used to but pretty good once you learn how to use it.  The system was changed in 2016 witch helped.  I very highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.

lincoln,navigator,2016,John Boyer, 09/22/2016,Exceeded expectations until the repairs,5,"I have owned seven Expeditions and had wonderful experience with all of them.  Very capable but unreliable.   I test drove a 2016 Expedition and then a Lincoln Navigator.  Navigator was superior fit, finish, ride  and very quiet in comparison.  I own a Lexus LS 460 sedan which is top of line Lexus.  My Navigator is actually quieter than the Lexus.  I was astounded.   Other large SUVs such as Tahoe, Escalade, QX 80 did not have the capacity or the ride that I wanted.  Also I had read about reliability issues on other vehicles.   I have been driving large SUVs for 19 years and found this car is just easy to drive.   So, I bought the 2wd Navigator Reserve.  I could not be more afraid of a vehicle.    Huge regrets.  Since I last posted this review I had a total engine failure due to EGR valve.  It was an item subject to a service bulletin.
Lincoln should fix all of them before a breakdown.  I was put in a dangerous position when it failed.  Other than that, vehicle  is still a wonder.  I am now at about 19000 miles.  After 43000 miles had issue of a slight squeak  with steering colum cowel which was fixed under warranty.   At just 51000 miles and out of warranty the throttle  body failed again.  It cost $850 to fix it.  I am now on my third throttle body.  I was told  by dealer that the problem is the electronics in the throttle body that failed.  Vehicle is dangerously unreliable at this point.  Ford and Lincoln have no service bulletin on this but they probably should. As long as I have owned vehicles I have never heard of even one failing and I have two failures.  Be wary.
Now I have almost 100,000 miles on the car and have had zero other problems.  It drives and looks as good as day I purchased it. Long live Navigator~

lincoln,navigator,2016,Chris Eickhorst, 10/13/2017,Don’t be Shocked,4,"We purchased a 2016 certified Navigator as we are now retired and planned on making many road trips. We now have 57,000 miles on it with nearly 30,000 of those miles being highway driven. We loaded the SUV down and took a trip from Florida to Yellowstone to California. We were impressed with the fuel economy for such a heavy SUV, averaging around 18-19 highway MPG. Very comfortable ride, superior performance and handling. We were disappointed in oral commands to the navigation and so when choosing a new destination you have to be at a stop. 2017 model has a very much improved command center. Recently we were told we needed new shocks ($1700.00 from the dealership) new brakes and now new calipers. We are 7,000 out of warranty so now on our own for over $2500 in repairs on this SUV. We called Lincoln Support and too bad so sad nothing they can do. Really? Not even discounted parts? Very disappointed in their ability to help out. The shocks were probably bad within the warranty period but it was never mentioned to me even though the dealership completed their multi point inspection. Dealership parts department was not at all surprised at our order of new shocks apparently they’ve sold a lot of them. Our mechanic was shocked at the amount of repairs needed on such a new vehicle as were we. Heck, the bolts weren’t even rusted on the parts removed!

I've only owned mine for 6 months and have put on about 7K miles. I really like the vehicle It's comfortable to drive and has a great turning radius for such a big vehicle. I've had absolutely no issues with it so far. The only complaint I have it around it's handling on rough roads - it throws everyone in the car around quite a bit and makes it uncomfortable.

Before purchasing this Navigator, I have driven 2 Tahoes for 21 years.  My first drive in this new Navigator I notice the quietness of the interior cabin.  The ride is very smooth.  I am also surprised by the turbocharged engine.  The acceleration is smooth and quick.  Confidence builder!  The only think I felt lacking is the instrument panel.  It is on the small side.  The font size of wording is too small for my eyes to read quickly.  The pinkish lighting color on the word just makes it even harder to read.  Other than that I am very happy with the purchase.

Did a carfax on it and everything was good so far, saw it at the dealership and test drove it along with the 2017 expedition el platinum. This is definitely a lot quieter than the expedition and there are significant differences that make it a Lincoln w/ a different badge and not just some Expedition w/ a different badge. Ended purchasing this w/ a 10yr/100k bumper2bumper warranty. The vehicle drives like a dream. My family and I were also looking at the new top of the line Suburban, Yukon Denali XL, Escalade, and the AMG GLS 63 SUV. Ended up with this one because fr the price point and what I was getting it was just worth it.   Did not like the GM vehicles, the steering felt sloggy and who still uses column shifters on high end vehicles?! As for the gls63, towing capacity maxes out @ 7500 which for that price point and motor it's got it rather weak. The Navigator has the ability to tow and tow a boat/trailer it will here in the Pacific NW. Overall impressed, just wish the 2017 model was not as antiquated with the accoutrements inside; but that was definitely addressed with the 2018 totally redesigned Navigator. Those are selling like hotcakes!

When testing other brands of vehicles we found that lane departure and other features did not work well. This year and prior years did not have this feature but since they don't appear to be reliable we did not care. The ride comfort is great. The turbo charged V6 engine is very powerful. Much more so than competitor's large V8s. This car delivers the comfort, style and power that you would expect from a vehicle in this class.

lincoln,navigator,2017,oldmansknees, 01/07/2020,I'd love it if I could drive it!,2,"Coming from a Suburban, I love driving this vehicle. When it's drive-able that is.I have had constant problems with the door latches freezing (they open, but bounce open and won't latch when this occurs). This has been fixed 3 times by 2 different dealers, there was a ""customer satisfaction program"" on these. The F-150 pickups have the same latches/problem, there is a class action lawsuit over this.
Now the engine sounds like it is self destructing at 29K miles. Do a search on this motor and timing chain/phasers and it's turns out it's a well known problem. 3 weeks in the shop now, the body is off the frame and the engine is torn apart. 
 Last problem - the door stops don't hold the rear doors open on the slightest hill. Kids, dogs, parents all have the door slam on them if you don't hold the door open. Been ""fixed"" twice now, never gets any better. Not a huge problem if you're aware of it.
What it boils down to is this has been my beef with Ford, and why I went 15 years before I'd touch another one - they can't get simple things right on their vehicles. I'll ride the warranty out on this one, then I'm done with Ford!

The highway mileage on trips in the conserve mode reaches 23 mpg all the time. It has so many standard features that are optional on other luxury full size SUV. It uses regular unleaded and the yearly maintenance cost is a fraction of an import. The twin turbo V6 has tremendous horsepower and torque that other luxury SUV V8 cant even match.

lincoln,navigator,2018,Chris, 09/28/2018,Car nice - dealers not so much.,3,"Wanted a black label but they dont have black leather seatsm go figure, huge error. Purchased 2018 reserve 2 weeks ago @ 97k .  Came across a couple issues.  Steering column plastic housing rubs slightly when turning - AC when running both rear and front zones seams to lose temperature, osillated from warm to cold and never freezing, random. Passenger side second row seat belt lacked tension and wont retract- this part is on backorder. These issues are small and will get reseloved, but its an indication of a slight build quality issue. The biggets issue is the Lincoln dealers. Lincoln corporate puts the white glove message out there that they will come get your car and give you a loaner etc  ( purhcased maint package ) use the app to schedule etc. Well thats a fantasy.......I purhcased my care from a dealer thats 65 miles away because they had the car. However the nearest dealer is 5 miles away. When I contacted them for servive on my new 100k car they said sorry you didnt buy it here so no loaner car. I had to escalate  this to lincoln and threaten them etc.... finally after 2 weeks and wasting  time on the phone they accomodated me. Point is Lincoln corporate needs to get these dealers up to to speed with the marketing message if they are going to sell 100k cars. I had a platinum escalde before this and zero issues and amazing service. That said its a gorgeous car and I hope to enjoy it once its out of the shop.

I think it can eat into Bentley and Rolls Royce Cullinan sales.  It’s that luxurious and it seats 7 or 8 not 4 or 5!  Built in America is another plus.  I questioned the Hankook tires but when I went to see the new Audi Q8...you guessed it...same.  Must be a new high tech tire factory!  Steering wheel heater switch is a touch on the LCD screen, I’d rather have a hard switch near the steering wheel but I guess that’s the way things are going for reliability and efficiency.  Love that it has Start / Stop at the stoplight, the tech in general, control it and get status from my iPhone, piano key shifter, it’s powerful 6 cylinder engine, independent rear suspension and Aluminum body panels.  The head up display is nicer than the one in my Corvette.  I’d love to see a Brembo Brakes option like Escalade has but other than that, it’s the winner of that contest. Also a repeat prompt button for Navigation is sorely needed.
I loved it so much I bought my new Gator rather than lease it!
Update: would like to have a suspension tighten switch. The only way to tighten it up is to choose Excite on the drive select knob. I’d like to tighten it in normal.  The previous generation had separate selections for transmission and suspension.

lincoln,navigator,2018,JC from St Charles IL, 02/07/2019,"Great ride, but so hum for kids",4,"The ride, quality materials and others are great on this vehicle.  Many have already highlighted the PROS and I agree with them.  This is from a 4 month ownership review of four ""not worth it"" aspect.  1) $2K rear entertainment system is not worth it.  First, the dual screens are not touch screen (why not?) and to compound it, the navigation is too awkward and frustrating.  Second, the screens have to be sync'd to the car speakers via bluetooth, how awkward - we experience sound delays and you have to pair the bluetooth after each ignition, for which you have to navigate the complicated screens and wait for the sync.  Why not just a dedicated, simple wire connection (and bring the cost down)?  2) 3rd row gets a lot of the exhaust sound.  You would not notice this unless you've experience it in real world situations.  The droning sound is annoying in mid-long trips.  Extra sound-proofing is required for $90K+ vehicle.  3) Climate change take the entire user interface/navi screen.  When you need to see the navi route, its obscured by the single large dial that tell me that the climate fan is changed from 2 to 3 speed and then you wait for it disappear.   Its not a good design.  4) I heard of the parts shortage that's slowing down vehicle production and in Nov, just 3 weeks of ownership, the vehicle got rear-ended and that when I fully understood the supply chain issue.  The vehicle was brought into a Lincoln authorized body shop for the rear bumper and underlying plastic pieces to be replaced.  We were given a 1 week turn-around time.  The body shop called and told us that the parts were back-ordered (even after we were assured that the parts would arrive that week).  Regional Ford/Lincoln parts depot quoted a new delivery the following week.  Again, the body shop called to tell us there was a delay in the parts delivery due to back-order.  This happened 2 more times.  We waited and waited.  Finally after 6 weeks at the shop, the repairs were completed.  Lesson learned.

Interior is very upscale and seats super comfortable.   We love it as a family.  Roomy and great ride.  It’s only been 2 weeks so no answer in reliability.

lincoln,navigator,2018,SUVOwner, 10/20/2018,Lincoln Play RSE - NO DVD / OTHER ISSUES,3,"Owned the vehicle for two weeks.  My wife is literally crying and wants her 2011 Infiniti QX56 back.  Family of 4 children (with a 3 year old) who have become accustom to always watching movies while riding.  Wife's disgust with the vehicle is based solely on the Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) system that has 1) no DVD player, 2) Cumbersome/time-consuming steps to have the RSE play through the speakers, 3) audio through the Bluetooth connection to the vehicle's speakers are delayed, and 4) NO controls on the front screen.  There is practically NO integration between the vehicle and RSE; Lincoln should have simply said 'we have no RSE option' go find an aftermarket unit.  Lincoln clearly did no functional testing with a family usage of this system - it would have taken placing a mother with a carseat child in the vehicle for one trip to the grocery store to know the flaws.  The RSE has much other great technology, but totally missed the mark on the basic functionality.  One last thought of confusion from lincoln - no DVD because it is old technology, but they REQUIRE a CD player for the upgraded audio speakers - REALLY????   If your needs do not include a RSE for children, the vehicle is very very nice, and you will enjoy the vehicle.  Unfortunately, for me . . .

It comes standard with navigation, blind spot monitoring, front and back parking sensors. I didn't want a sunroof or the technology package.  I mainly wanted the 20 inch wheels which provide a smooth ride without needing adaptive suspension that comes with the 22 inch wheels.  You also fixed steps instead of automatic steps on the side. Once you are inside the interior and seating are the same as select and reserve models. I  got a great deal for 68,900 so my depreciation wont be as great as the higher end models. I have averaged 21mpg over the first 4000 miles.

lincoln,navigator,2018,Rebecca, 02/26/2019,Awful entertainment system,5,"I never write reviews but don’t want anyone to make the same mistake that I did by buying the Lincoln entertainment system. This is the worst entertainment system i’ve Ever seen in a car. The system is completely separate from the car itself (like sticking 2 iPads on the back of the seats) and can not be controlled from the front easily. It also is not integrated with the car sound system (my kids are too little to wear headphones) so that I can not have something play on the entertainment system through the speakers & have it switch to a phone call on Bluetooth because rather than having the entertainment system wired to the sound system, it’s just a Bluetooth connection for the sound with the entertainment system. So basically i need to choose between screaming kids or taking a phone call safely in my car. Would have expected better from Lincoln. Nobody in Lincoln or the dealership wants to take responsibility for this awful system they sold me.

lincoln,navigator,2018,Gator Driver, 09/23/2018,Almost Perfect,4,"What's not to love about the new Navigator. I'm coming out of a Denali, and there's simply no comparison.  Much better interior space, and much higher trim level then Denali or Escalade.  I appreciate the amount of power available as well as the fuel economy.  For the overall big SUV luxury category this is the new industry leader.  There is only one detraction - the rear Air Conditioning.  The AC simply can't keep the second row cool, and the third row doesn't have a prayer. I took my Navigator in for service. The company is aware of the issue, but as of yet - does not have a solution.  If you live in a warm climate and/or expect to have many rear passengers - please be ware.  Other then that, this Navigator is a joy to drive, allowing all to arrive in comfort and style!

lincoln,navigator,2018,bad purchase, 04/26/2019,Rip OFF,2,"I thought buying this car was going to be the best vehicle I've had yet but NOPE, that's not the case! I switched from a Yukon Denali XL and HATE it.  I have a gravel driveway and this damn car hates coming up my driveway, I have to put it in deep conditions just to make it up an that's in nice weather. I've owned this car for over 1 year and am losing my A$$ to trade it in. And that's with a 5yr loan and I have been paying extra every month since my 1st payment. The car has an awkward thump when it down shifts while coming to a stop that I despise of. When you want to change a seat setting, climate control, a text comes through on your phone, or you want to turn on the seat massager, your entire screen gets taken over. So you better hope your not using your navigation and a text comes through during a confusing intersection. It sucks and I absolutely hate this vehicle. I am looking to trade it in on the BMW X7 and can only pray it isn't as big of a let down as this vehicle. Now for the Premium maintenance package - keep an eye out for what your being charged for. I had my car in for an oil change and inspection. They called and said it needed wipers and an alignment, they ended up charging me for the wipers and weren't supposed to. Make sure to read what you bought and pay attention! When I purchased they told me it was for so many years, turns out it's only for 12 times. My advice is don't do it!!!!

lincoln,navigator,2018,Okladoug, 02/11/2019,Lincoln Luxury,5,"I purchased the Premier 2WD edition . I wanted 20 inch tires instead of the 22 inch tires with adaptive suspension. The 20 inch tires provide a much more composed ride at a better price. The premier has so much standard that I didn't feel the extra thousands for a select was worth it. The reserve only comes 4WD which I didn't need. You have much more tire wall that it is less likely to scrape your wheels. I wanted fixed running boards instead of the automatic ones. The seats navigation and revel stereo is the same in the select and premier. I didn't want a sunroof that is standard in the reserve. The best thing was my price of $68,900. When I decide to sell in a few years my depreciation wont be so dramatic. After 7000 miles my mileage has been 20.7 miles per gallon. I couldn't be happier with my burgandy velvet Navigator with cappuccino interior. I also have a dedicated stand alone Lincoln dealer. Their service is amazing.

I love the look and comfort as do my clients but for a $70,000 vehicle there are way too many electrical issues and I do not feel great long term with this vehicle like I did my Chevrolet Suburban. Headlights and brake light went out at 10,000 miles. Radio keeps not working. Side mirrors make clicking noises. Lincoln service is TERRIBLE at least in my market.

From the looks and lines of the exterior, to the amazing materials and design of the interior, the fresh new technology, the engine and the way it rides. I feel like a pilot in this vehicle and I feel like I'm riding a rocket ship through space. This car was a dream come true for me because I wanted one for years. I leased the Black Label and I wouldn't change a thing. I have not had one problem with this. I have heard that some people have had issues with the technology, but not me. The dealership even gave us a free Roku so the kids could have everything set up on their screens in the backseat because they thought it would ease and issues. We still have the Roku in the box, there just hasn't been a need for it. everything works fine. We pay $20/month for Wi-Fi in the car, and that has been a Godsend on roadtrips and saved us on our mobile data! Especially with two teens!! I only drive black cars, so I only had 3 options to choose from as far as interior colors because I got the Black Label. It was white, burgundy, or a light blue. No white with the kids and doggos, I don't like burgundy, so I got the blue. It is gorgeous. It's easy to clean, sleek and just a dream come true. It runs amazing in all the drive modes - excite, slippery, 4x4. Doesn't matter what drive mode I use, it runs like a dream. I absolutely love this SUV!!!

Always keep in mind it's a fancy ford...same low quality paint job, interior knobs and trims are cheap looking and feel cheap...example: radio, a.c. controls. The rear entertainment system is the worst in the market! Only SUV with no DVD...they didn't think this through...so some of us can look past the NO DVD, but what movies can you really play on a USB or SD card? NONE! Or pirated movies! You can stream netflix or roku or whatever but you will pay $20 a month on top for wifi via ATT&T.  If you have a BMW or MBZ you will hate be very let down with this vehicle.

lincoln,navigator,2018,cluigi, 12/22/2018,By far and away the finest SUV I have ever owned,5,"18 month ownership update. 
Other than one single LED lamp which went out and was replaced during a scheduled oil change - the truck has been flawless. My same arguments and comments below remain germane. Remains the finest FULL sized SUV I’ve owned and the Escalade and Denali owners I know fully agree. 

Original review
This is truly a $s decision in my mind.  If you are going to pay $80,000 for a large SUV you have only a few choices and honestly the which one is it going to be a personal preference decision.  From a specs on technology, ride and cargo/towing there really isn't a competition - so if you are weighing logically (not likely) the decision is over, until 2018 the odds on luxury SUV for a full size vehicle likely would have been a Caddy.  Now comes 2018 (and 2019, same truck) with the all Aluminum body and the 6 cylinder ecoboost with 10 speed tranny there is only one choice for a reasonable person trying to be gentle on the environment while still driving a beast of a truck - the Navigator.  The Caddy's big V8 has nearly half the gas milage and still not the torque or power of the Ford/Lincoln V6 ecoboost. Not to mention the Navigator is a front forward class leader for looks and redefines seating luxury.  Nuf said.

lincoln,navigator,2018,amymc313, 07/06/2020,Be prepared for repairs,3,"This is my second Lincoln Navigator I have owned.  I purchased it brand new in June of 2018.  In the first 18 months of ownership it spent 77 days in the shop. Mainly a variety of electrical issues that they couldn't figure out how to repair. Seats that would move on their own, hatch that would open by itself, side mirrors that would get stuck and click, and a strange sound coming from the engine at start up. Trying to resolve this will BBB and Lincoln Customers service to no avail. For a $100k car, I would expect better customer service.
If you want to talk about comfort, drivability, and options, this car is top notch! Just a shame that it's had so many issues and it has sat so many days at the dealer waiting for repair vs in my driveway.

lincoln,navigator,2019,USN, 10/09/2019,No replacement for displacement,5,"We’re a Ford family, a new Superduty every 3-4 years for towing and still have my 2003 F-150 for routine ranch duties. I can count on one hand the number of check engine lights in >15 years and hundreds of thousands of miles (and tons), on multiple trucks. That being said there was a lot of gripes for my last Navigator (‘08), wallowing with every breeze or rut, gutlessly, down the highway. Grudgingly we stuck with the always-something-wrong but more planted and fun to drive Escalade ESV’s—just never past the end of the warranty.  Lincoln finally did it right and this is easily the most comfortable vehicle I’ve ever owned: the seats are unparalleled, ergonomics are perfect, great storage and it drives like a crossover. My only gripe is I miss the Caddy’s V8 punch.  Although the speedometer climbs faster it just doesn’t feel as fast or confident during 2-lane highway passing. It linearly hurdles into, and calmly/quietly handles, speeds which get you one free phone call and maybe that’s why it doesn’t feel as fast but I really wish the turbos were blowing into two banks of 4 cylinders. Well and the rear TV’s can only be figured out by the kids. 

Of note we’ve averaged 16.6 MPG over ~8,300 miles of mixed driving, albeit we live in rural Texas so not much city and higher-speed highway.

Lincoln refused to replace the engine as well as the transmission. Sadly, I absolutely loved my Navigator. ￼￼￼It had all the bells and whistles you could ever want but mechanically the car was junk.￼
Please don’t fall into the same trap we did. These are beautiful luxury cars but they are horrible and Lincoln’s customer service is by far worse than the vehicle they built.￼￼ There is no customer service whatsoever! It was a horrible experience and I’m glad it is finally over.

lincoln,navigator,2019,Bruce, 05/22/2020,Dealer crashed the vehicle due to computer problem,1,"Three months ago, my dealer picked up my 2019 Navigator L Black Label for service.  While in their possession they crashed it due to an ongoing technical problem and backed it into their building causing over $44,000 in damage to the vehicle.  Now, three months later, Ford is unable to provide some of the parts.  In particular, the glass for the rear tailgate; the sensors for the cross vehicle detection system, and others.   The crash was caused because when one of their employees went to put the car in reverse, it lunged backward apparently at full throttle and crashed through a wall in the dealership, causing over $44,000 in damage to the Navigator.  While the dealership has been very helpful, getting the parts from Ford is a problem.  Also, since I have had ongoing issues with the vehicle's computers, I am now scared to drive it.

Hate and I mean hate the rear seat entertainment system - DO NOT opt for it - it was a $2000 con (it can’t be controlled from the front so toddlers can’t use it) - Lincoln just shrugged its shoulders. After a year, mine still has the plastic on the screens - useless. Love the seats and the ride compared to the Escalade. Hate the piano key shift - thought it was cool until doing 3 point turns. Getting any parts for the car is a nightmare right now (COVID). Safety features like the backup cameras are much better on the Escalade (camera does not auto switch to front camera when put in drive after backing up - the Escalade does this automatically). If Cadillac upgrades their seats and reliability, I will be returning my business to them.

lincoln,ls,2000,youngun123, 01/29/2014,You get what you pay for,3,"in the end it all comes down to how the car is maintained and taken care of. Mine, a 2000, gen1, maintained, documented since its purchase, two owners ago was good to see when purchasing the vehicle. Typically people only write a review on this website if they are very un satisfied and did not take care of the vehicle. Rarely does a middle of the road person or satisfied person write a review, ever. so far, 30,000 miles into the purchase of the vehicle (127k when i bought it, 157k now) no issues. Only basic oil changes, trans fluid, etc. If you use premium gas, your coils do not burn up and the engine will be fine. This perticular one has ran on premium since it was purchased."
lincoln,ls,2000,notsoavgcarguy, 10/15/2012,"Fun Car, Stylish, not worth the Repairs",3,"Where to start? I bought this car used back in 2008 with about 70,000 miles on it. I loved it when I bought it - excellent power, quick, superb handling, beautiful car inside and out. Then it started to drain my account.

Once it hit 90,000 miles it started to fall apart. I had to replace the front ball joints, $1,000. Because it's a Jag with a Lincoln brand, you're paying for foreign parts along with extremely high labor due to its tight fit and weird part locations under the hood. You should know this up front.

Coils and Valve Cover Gaskets ran me about $1,000.

Air bag light was always on though I never bothered to have that checked out.

I babied this car and it just took my money."

I understand vehicles come with some repairs however my list of repairs are ridiculous: Plugs, Coils and Valve cover gaskets replaced on both sides twice, new transmission, new alternator, two bad wheel bearings, bad ball joint, two window regulators (my fault) and my favorite feature is when it is super cold in our MN winters it doesn't like to start very much.  What a joke, some of the things listed could pertain to my driving habits but not all of them.  All in all unless you are a millionaire forget about it."
lincoln,ls,2000,dunndarryn, 11/28/2012,I hope this review saves you from making the same mistake I did,3,"Don't buy this car if you have any kind of budget to live on. My mom bought my LS when it had 60k miles in 2006 and gave it to me in 2011 and I sold it in November 2012. It was beautiful for a while but as the miles stacked up, so did the problems. Between the money we both had to put into that car in repairs to keep it running, we paid for it at least 3 times. They are beautiful cars but they are problematic and expensive to fix. If you are dead set on getting an LS, get a Gen. 2 (2003-2006) with LOW miles and do your research before making a decision! I can't stress that enough."
lincoln,ls,2000,reporter7, 02/11/2002,An American Success,4,"Although I've always been partial to european sports sedans, aside from a lack of ""snob appeal"" the LS V8 offers as much fun and more value than most of the offerings from across the pond.

The ride/handling trade-off is well judged, and the balance possible with rear-wheel drive will be a revelation to those who have become accustomed to front-drivers."

I have been somewhat fortunate so far, but have had some of the more common malfunctions mentioned in other reviews.  The car had 70k miles on it when purchased.  It now has 105k on it.  It is a rear wheel drive car and does handle terribly in the snow.  I have had 1 window malfunction, the air condition did blow out hot and cold air at the same time, and the ball joints caused the steering to shake.  These repairs totaled around $750, and that is it so far.  None of the malfunctions caused the car to break down, but were recommended repairs.  Around 25 mi per gallon.

Have had  an electrical fix and leaky exhaust gaskets (both under warranty).

I am a driving enthusiast and will say that I push this car hard in the corners every chance I get.  The LS responds by carving like a pair of giant slalom skis on packed snow.  Torque is a bit low as this affects off- the-line acceleration.  The car has muscular, yet sexy body lines.  It is a dream to drive an own.

Beautiful looking, and that slight growl of the v8 under the hood hits a perfect note. The seats are comfortable yet supproting, the stereo is amazing, the cockpit feel is amazing.In fact my last bmw was a 2000 540i and believe the acceleration on the lincoln is peppier and more refined. I would never buy one new, but for a mere $2300 for this car, you really cannot go wrong. If you want some fun, refinement, and not look like too pretentious this is the ride.

My husband is a mechanic so we were able to do it oursleves cheap. Its a tight squeeze in the engine compartment and requires a lot of special tools and lots of labor /time to do simple repairs (hence the costs) This has been a great car so far, though I am leery as I know the history with Jaguars reliability.

They made a design change because the third transmission is smooth and winds out really nicely. I always used synthetic oil, had typical failures.  Believe it or not it has the original spark plugs and muffler. Changed tires to Michlins.  First set had 120,000. Current 101,000 m. It is good buy for a sedan with a V8. V8s cost an extra 10 grand today. I have put off buying new because I could not find something I liked as well.  May buy MKS w/V6. I love V8s."

The transmission went out on me. I had to replace a simple air/breathing hose, which resides under the intake manifold and the fuel injectors.  A 99 cent hose cost me 1700$ in labor.  To do any type of maintenance, the intake manifold had to be removed because it was layed on the very top. That meant many hrs in labor, no matter what the fix was.

First the front lower ball joints needed replaced, they were recalled but the company wouldn't pay for mine.  Then the alternator and battery needed replaced. Int and Ext lights went off outta nowhere!  It overheats also. It continues to leak water from the windshield when it rains. One window regulator was replaced. The airbag light is stuck on. The sway bar still has a clunking noise. Drives terribly in the snow, get stuck every year.  Love the style, just not dependable. Never again will I buy a lincoln/ford auto."

The first week i had it both cadillac converters had to be replaced, car vibrates at 45, poor gas mileage, drivers door broken have to open from outside,car won't start right, you have to turn the engine over 5 or 6 times before it starts. Recently my power steering pump went out and i haven't been able to drive it. I'm now looking for a new car. Please don't but this car you will regret every penny spent. I bought mine for almost $7000 and the car is only worth $2500.  Upside down. Not fun."

truly caught my interest.

Ended up leasing a V8 with the sport 
package for the 17"" wheels) and the 
Alpine radio upgrade. Should have 
bought from the beginning.

The first year had to have the car in 
the shop for several nusiance repairs 
(turn signal, radio hum, seat and body 
trim, exhaust heat shield, etc). Even 
though all this was covered by warranty

transmissions replaced, several 
recalls, stranded us several times. 
Spent months at a time in the 
dealership garage. A real lemon. If 
you buy one of these used (I recommend 
you don't!) have them run your VIN

make them throw in an extended

The new one is not much better. 4

breaks up and misses. Ford claimed that 
it's normal, but I did not buy that 
line of bunk, especially for a 
performance sedan. The Dealer is 
arguing with Ford about it now. We have 
a loaner, but Once fixed and the

I think that most ls owners have had these same problems and if not will in the future. To bad ford has not taken care of these known problems or improve on the newer models.

fit a regular sized container; three, 
the front passenger seat does not

at the dealer once told me I just had 
to accept the shimmy in the front end. 
Trim pieces (back of seats, door

to replace both motors in the rear 
electric windows, ball joints, and a T-
valve for the AC (the passenger side 
blew hot while the driver's side blew 
cold). The dealer tells me I should 
really have the front end aligned every 
5-6K miles or the tires wear out 
prematurely. If you have a phone in the 
console, you're out of storage space.

lincoln,ls,2000,vipbrettp, 07/26/2004,The Most Fun Car I've Ever Owned,4,"In 2001 I got out of a Ford Taurus SHO 
and into a 2000 LS.  I have to say that 
despite the signifigant drop in 
horsepower, and increase in weight (the 
LS weighs over 4000 lbs) the LS is 
still more fun to drive.  I only say 
this as I have the 5 spd manual 
tranny.  The engine is too weak for the 
automatic, which I think feels very 
underpowered (though newer models have 
steadly increased horsepower).  The 
rear wheel drive and surperb balance 
make cornering a dream.  Have had 
several interior trim issues as have 
been noted elsewhere.  All window 
regulators have been replaced.  I do 
have oil in the spark plug wells, 
causing the car to missfire.  Now the 
break l"
lincoln,ls,2000,gkarg, 08/18/2004,Lincoln LS is a Classy car,4,"I have really enjoyed my 2000 LS.  I 
have had nary a problem with this 
vehicle and the satisfaction of 
ownership has been excellent.  Long 
distance trips are a breeze.  The early 
Duratec V6's don't have quite enough 
low-end umph - but when not loaded, 
there is ample power for every day 
commuting.

The handling is superb.  Ride is 
awesome.  The safety features and 
ratings were a high point for me.  I do 
not drive it in the winter, but with 
snow tires - it will perform in snowy 
conditions just fine."
lincoln,ls,2000,oldn0tded, 10/08/2004,I'm a HAPPY guy,4,"An excellent car. I have driven mine 
15000 miles and the car is better than 
I had hoped. I have the Sport Package 
and don't believe I have ever driven a 
better handling 4 door, period.

The reliability has been as good as 
any car I have ever owned. The dealer 
has been very supportive even though I 
bought mine used. I have had minor 
things, ie. the license tag lights 
have had to be replaced, under 
warranty. 

I agree with the owner that stated 
Lincoln/Mercury is not marketing the 
car properly. It's an American made 
BMW. Contrary to the magazine 
comments, I love the styling. I really 
can't relate to Cadillacs new 
direction or what Chris Bangle has 
done to BMW . "
lincoln,ls,2000,Fred Nickols, 03/11/2003,My Leased Lincoln,5,"I leased a 2000 Lincoln LS V8 with no

is the best riding, best performing car 
I've ever had."
lincoln,ls,2000,lee tallent, 12/29/2004,Lots of minor but expensive problems,3,"This is a great looking car which is fun to drive and handles great. I bought mine used in 02 and it has been in the shop 12-15 times in the last 2 1/2 years.  The extended warranty ran out 5,000 miles ago and since then I have had to replace 2 coils, Approx 180.00 each time and a third is now in need of replacement along with leaky gaskets ect (another 580.00 to repair)  This is 'affordable luxury' which I just can't afford.  I am ready to trade because I wonder what is going to happen next.  "
lincoln,ls,2000,Gene, 08/22/2005,V8 Style is Peppy,5,"This was not my first Lincoln but it was the finest yet in a package that would fit in my small garage.  I have experienced no mechanical problems at all (mileage is now at 66,000). Interior wood and leather trimming was done with great care and quality.  Controls are clear. Driver 1 and driver 2 setting re-align  steer, mirrors, seat, lighting and radio.  The automatic headlamps and windshield wiper sensors are as good as most of the Lexus models. The instant response for power on highway access roads is impressive.  The only negative is the small trunk space; on a par with the Jaguar XK series."
lincoln,ls,2000,Randy, 09/16/2005,Fun to Drive,3,"Great car for a winding road (with the sport package).  Replaced a Pontiac Bonneville w/ this LS and was amazed at the tight road-hugging suspension.  I love getting on a curvy road, hitting the curves as speed, and holding on for the ride!"

lincoln,ls,2000,Stan, 08/14/2006,I love my LS,4,"I've had this car since it was brand new, and I still enjoy driving it. It has a perfect weight distribution (50% front and 50% rear) and so it has an amazing amount of stability and road gripping ability.  Admittedly, I baby it quite a bit ( I always keep it in the garage, always service on time, and don't put on a lot of miles), but I've had very little trouble with this car in almost seven years of driving it.  My daughter will be starting to drive soon, and she is begging me to give her the car.  She loves it, but I'm not sure that I want to give it up!"

lincoln,ls,2000,Pete Shemetulskis, 05/03/2007,Enjoyed this car!,4,"Other than the transmission which I have found to be a problem for Lincolns, unless the fluid is changed early, this car has been a very good addition to my family.  I would highly recommend owning one."
lincoln,ls,2000,YARNELLF, 05/18/2007,Love It!,4,"I purchased this car because I like luxury cars and I always wanted one! Beautiful car for drivers who are not rough drivers and know when and how to take care of a luxury automobile.  You cannot take care of this car the same way you take care of a car like a Saturn, Pontiac or Kia."
lincoln,ls,2000,Rosi, 07/07/2007,Love it!,4,"I bought this car in 2005 with 62k mls on it and since then it is really a good purchase. Never left me stranded or alone. Pleasure to drive, but tranny could be quicker to downshift. I had to change so far: sway bar bushings, brakes (75k mls), spark plugs, water pump hose, tranny fluid. Problem with fueling (still pending; evap hose broken or flap valve sticking).  Otherwise regular maintenance, would buy again."
lincoln,ls,2000,Mikewmp, 04/26/2003,Fun car to own/head turner,4,"Purchased this automoble after seing a 
few around, after test driving several 
times i purchased the great automoble. 
Has been in the shop twice once for and 
accident that this vehicle held up very 
well during collision and those rear 
windows. I think other comsumers think 
every car they buy should be perfect 
and those that have problem with this 
vehicle can find that every vehicle is 
perfect in any fleet show me one. It 
all has to do with the dealership and 
the working realtionship. So far great 
automobile. Remember a human build it."
lincoln,ls,2000,chris s, 09/20/2007,No more,3,"Fun to drive and that's about it.  64000 miles and the car is slowely falling apart. Tranny problems, leaky oil valves, radio display don't work, replaced interior mirror and exterior. air bag light come on due to cut wire under the seat.  Dealer made it sound like it was my fault because I had my seat set on easy entry.... too many problems to keep it.  My wife has a Toyota with 120k miles and no problems.  Lincoln, Ford stinks they don't stand behind their product no wonder they have problems.. Can't wait to get rid of this junk.  No more American cars, sad but true."
lincoln,ls,2000,Sally Steiner, 09/15/2007,Great Car,4,"What a welcome change from the lumbering behemoths of Lincoln's recent past. This car was really quick, fun to drive, good looking inside and had very good amenities for driver and passenger alike. White Pearl finish was awesome. I wish Lincoln would have simply kept working on upgrading the car instead of discontinuing it. Could have been a classic."

warranty repairs, it's been a great vehicle to 
own and maintain.  I've put 56,000 miles on it

to be cleaned up.  I have only average 
driving mileage (30k)for 3 years, but 
love the way my car drives and the 
wonderful milage of the V8 sport.  I 
have only had one issue - a rear window 
motor replacement.   The car has 
provided enough power and enthusiasm 
whether I'm driving to pick up my kids 
or to visit distant relatives 600+ 
miles away.  Please don't change my car 
platform so I can get it again for my 
next car!"
lincoln,ls,2000,Jackofms, 03/14/2002,Great Car,4,"Even though it is a 6, this is the best driving car I've had."
lincoln,ls,2000,msmac500, 03/16/2002,Needs more power for the price,4,The car is beautiful to look at. It lacks power though. The 5-speed is pretty slow in my opinion and it makes a lot of noise without really going anywhere. When the lease comes up for renewal I may opt for the V-8 LS or go to another brand such as the Cadillac CTS which is a little less expensive for a little more car.
lincoln,ls,2000,Greg R-LSv6, 03/18/2002,I'd buy another - wish the V8 had a 5 Sp,4,"I am an ex race car owner/driver.  I wanted a reasonably priced performance sedan.  While I want the BMW M5, it is outrageously expensive.  The Ls is very fun to drive, predictable, and honestly powerful enough for street driving.  I look forward to every trip in that car.  A key buying factor was the Gertrag 5-speed.  I had to have a manual"
lincoln,ls,2000,MBlount, 03/22/2002,Great Car,4,"So far, my experience with my LS has been excellent.  I got the V8 Sport package and highly recommend it.  The handling is so much better.

I personally love the exterior styling except for the rear tail lights.  Too many people think it is a Mitsubishi Diamante from the rear.

The car is a really good value if you purchase one used.  Mine stickered for over $40,000 new, but I paid $26,000 for it when it came off a two year lease with only 24,000 miles.

If you are currently considering a new Camry, Maxima, Accord, or similar car, I highly recommend you look at this car used.  You are getting much more car for the money."
lincoln,ls,2000,Stan The Man, 03/23/2002,They STILL Don't Believe It's A Lincoln,4,"It's been almost 2 years since I got my LS Sport (V8). Even now, people still ask me what kind of car it is because of the way it looks and performs. Its the best car I've ever owned or driven. This (rear wheel drive) car is very sure-footed. Grips the road even when you add a little water. The handling is just superb! Love that Advance Trac. The Select Shift too! For around forty grand, this vehicle is a work of art!!!"
lincoln,ls,2000,amy, 05/07/2008,"Good looking, nasty repairs",2,"Too many things going wrong with it. Three window regulators replaced at 350 a piece, had to put ceramic brake pads because of the brake dust, rear tail light leaking water in it, both catalytic converters, driver side window fell while driving on the highway. Air bag light stuck on. Love the syle though, just not dependable. Drives in the snow terrible. I get stuck every year in my driveway and slide all over the roads. Do not recommend to first time drivers. No space in the back seats."

The Lincoln has more features, luxury and no unexpected cost if you do regular maintenance. Also left me with a couple Grand to get it up to date. Best purchase I ever made. All I did was change oil, filter, cabin air filter, top O2 sensors, air cleaner, flush radiator, change diff. Oil, and wiper blades. That's it!!! So easy to work on I'm looking for a manual

lincoln,ls,2001,Steve Mcblue, 07/19/2010,Worst car I ever owned,3,"problems since day 1, terrible reliability with this car. I wont even start listing the issues cause it pains me. I'm a mechanic and this is one of the worst cars to work on. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from the LS."
lincoln,ls,2001,NoVaAgent, 01/11/2007,B2B WARRANTY is an ABSOLUTE MUST,3,"I thought I had it rough until reading some of these reviews.  Turns out my experience was average: bought at 45000, currently 72000.  During that time: rear valve cover gasket, two window motors, cruise control, steering wheel stereo controls, memory seat, sunroof, AC, 100% COVERED BY AFTERMARKET WARRANTY. Service trips- fixed the 1st time maybe 50% of the time.  **The key here is, the bang for the buck on this car when buying used is awesome.  But as an owner, you soon realize the catch, lots of problems, some small, some large, lots of service trips, tons of time wasted. what I find most unnerving about these poor reviews- there seems to be little pattern in the problems- whats next?"
lincoln,ls,2001,Kelly, 12/30/2009,Best Car ever.,5,I owned a 01 Lincoln LS until 12/23/09 and the reason for that is someone rear ended me and pushed me into oncoming traffic i then collided with a mustang i had 3 people plus me in the car we all walked away with just scraps and bruises that lincoln LS saved my family and my lives I will never drive anything else i will only feel safe in the lincoln so i am now shopping for a another one....
lincoln,ls,2001,D.Boyd, 07/23/2008,Great car gone bad!,3,"I purchased my 2001 LS as a lease return in Jan. of 2004 with 66,000K. Car was in perfect condition and had just been serviced by the dealer. Purchased a 48 month/50K warranty.Put 22,400 miles in 4 years when the transmission solenoids went bad. Cost $1090 to fix. Then a coil went bad. Cost $690. 10 months after the transmission problem, the transmission went out again. The dealer had closed so I went to AMMCO for the work. Cost $4200. Was thinking this car is costing me way too much when the car stopped on the freeway. Towed to dealer ,the engine coils were bad. Cost $2470. Dealer could not get the car to idle correctly. Took the car back 3 times, no luck. Traded in for  07 Infiniti G35."

lincoln,ls,2001,Jerry Stratos, 10/20/2009,After all these years!,3,After 3.5 years of owning a used Lincoln LS... Never again. :(  Especially taking new dates on ventures where you smell smoke buring off the engine because of a valve cover gasket leak... As I go down the highway the sterring wheel shakes vigorously and I assure her everthing is safe. :O  Last but not least... I refill my tires with air because I don't have the money to replace my corroding rims that are decaying from the inside out.  This car has cost me more money than it was worth... I should kept my old 87 Honda Accord that I sold for 500 bucks!  No wonder our beloved automakers are losing ground against the foreign competition... 
lincoln,ls,2001,cahill, 12/05/2009,2001 LS Review,4,"Bought the LS in 2002 as a new car.  Am totally satisfied.  It feels like a car I can still rely on especially with 130,000 miles on it.  I had to replace the window regulator twice, once on the driver side and once on the passenger side.  The cause both times were the plastic rollers and not the regulators.  Also the drivers seat heater quit working.  Other than that I love the car and would buy one again it it ever goes back into production."
lincoln,ls,2001,Bring back the LS, 12/17/2009,Good sports car not a family car,4,"I have had the vehicle for a few years now. I have had just a few problems with it. the valve cover gaskets leaked, the chrome on the inside of the rims had oxidated and potted out. I recently had to purchase new rims for the vehicle 8(. Over all the car has been a good car gets okay fuel mileage for a V8. Only thing i wish it had more of is storage room in the trunk and room in the car with 2 kids it can be a tight fit on long trips. "
lincoln,ls,2001,Chris, 02/18/2008,Say No to Ls,3,This is a awsome vehicle when running. At 99k the engine threw a rod which Ford could not replace.the lower ball joints went out which cost big bucks.It has cost a lot of money to own.I do want to point out that if your ls miss fires check for oil around the spark plug because it will leak oil int that area.
lincoln,ls,2001,VegasRob, 12/18/2004,Never Ending Problems,3,"I wish This car was more reliable because it was comfortable and fun to drive.   It got about 16 mpg, the headlights always fogged up, and the computer message center malfunctioned quite often.   I had this car less than a year and it was in the shop for repairs four times and for a total of a month and a half.  My extended warranty took care of my collasped driver side window, and my reconstructed transmission, but I forked over around $800 each for faulty t-stat and cracked radiator fluid tank, and shorted MAF sensor which fried my computer system in the car.   The car was stolen about a week ago and the cops haven't found it yet.     Maybe its a blessing in disguise.   Who knows..... "
lincoln,ls,2001,romaniv90, 06/15/2008,I love it,4,"I bought my first LS in 2007 with 104K miles on it. Yesterday, I've bought my second LS, and I love it. Yeah, I had some trouble with it, but it's a used car with a lot miles on, so you should expect some repairs. The only problem I've had with is it was overheating in traffic, so I went to many different mechanics, and they told me it might be a radiator, or a water pump. Eventually when I changed both of them myself, the motor on the fan broke, and that was the issue. So, I think its not the car, but some mechanics are just not educated enough.Otherwise, the car is amazing, I've just got a black on black one with low miles, and I can tell you its something amazing for an 18 year old."
lincoln,ls,2001,michelle, 12/14/2009,Nothing but problems,2,"This vehicle has been nothing but huge problems, electrical short blows out the tail lights, pieces of the interior just fall off (face plates, heater/ac vents), horn does not work, back fires from the manifold, doesn't start after the first am start, takes five cranks to get this thing running. This car should have been recalled it is a LEMON, nice to look at but not dependable at all! Poor job on this year/model Lincoln. Do not recommend unless you want to be nickel and dimed to death. Gas mileage was not even a concern it is just the odd mechanical problems this car has. "
lincoln,ls,2001,Ollie, 05/19/2010,Time to let her go,4,"I purchased this car for my wife and for the first 3 years of owning the car it was great.  Slowly things started going wrong which I guess is normal.  CD quit working, passeger door lock quit opening, gas door stopped opening, that kind of thing. at 89k it developed a spudder when you stepped on the gas.  After some research I realized it was either one of two fuel pumps or a coil. Pumps were $300 bucks a piece, coils were $50 a piece. I have replaced one coil already and I liken it to performing surgery, not fun to work on this car at all. Its a great car when it runs well but a nightmare to work on and very expensive to maintain when things start going bad.  Trade in value is horrible."

success. Ford had engineers and

lincoln,ls,2001,Soxfan647, 07/31/2005,Embarrassing quality issues,4,"I leased my 2005 LS V8 about a month ago, and have already had the vehicle in for service. The vehicle had several exterior trim fit and finish quality issues, including hood misalignment, driver side tail lamp misalignment, and passenger side rear door misalignment that resulted in the door latch impacting the striker bar, causing a loud squeaking noise when driving over bumps. Ultimately, 3 of the 4 doors were realigned, which took care of the squeaking noise. The driver side tail lamp and hood were both realigned. My only performance complaint is the responsiveness of the transmission. As a Ford employee, I'm embarrassed that our luxury flagship would have these build quality issues."

Performance and economy are more than adequate. Fit and finish are fine. Now at 55K+ miles it is as good as the day I bought it. I only wish I could buy another one that is brand new. However, these are rare and the prices are much greater than what I had paid for my car. But, I'd buy a new one if I could find one with even a reasonable price."

As of now, there is no air conditioning and it doesn't want to go in reverse. The repairs are numerous and very expensive!

imports in June 2001 and currently have 
64,000 miles on it. The deal was very 
good, got the first payment paid by the 
dealer, a 1.9% interest rate, and free 
maintanance for 36,000 miles. When I 
take it to the dealer I receive a free 
loaner car and I have had a 
continental, aviator and town car as 
loaners,  The dealer also provides free 
coffe and donuts and the am paper if 
you decide to wait.  I ride the highway 
a lot, and the car is very stable and 
quiet, stereo quality is good but not 
as good as my previous Nissan Maxima"

 whining noise in engine,transmission 
slips,  stalls, Engine revs, only likes 
to be driven in warm weather.Stereo has 
been replaced and the car paasenger 
side window fell into the door
 they let mechanic take my car home for 
the weekend I was called by the local 
police to be informed that the mechanic 
was out in my car at 9pm doing 60 in a

When I got my car back on monday 457 
miles had been put on it.
Owner of dealership refused my phone

Another dealership finally stepped in 
and Ford has just agreed to take my car 
back on the lemon law."
lincoln,ls,2001,Eric, 07/07/2008,Great car!,4,"I bought my LS new in 2001. As of July 2008 I have 144,000 miles on it. Overall this has been a great car. It's a V6 with 5 speed manual trans. The only problems I have had are 2 window regulators (I see this is a common problem but you can replace them yourself its not that hard) and 2 ignition coils that failed. I am still on the original clutch and have only replaced tires and brakes once - at 75,000 miles. Ride and handling are great, power is adequate, and fuel economy is good. I get about 20-22 mpg in normal city driving, and have seen high 20's on freeway trips."
lincoln,ls,2001,cwo3usmcret, 12/17/2007,Great used luxury vehicle,4,"I have read the previous reviews on this car.  I think this is one of the best looking cars that I have owned. The interior is very classy.  I did need to have new valve covers put on, but that is normal.  This is a quality car, very well built and fun to drive.  "
lincoln,ls,2001,Taruntaev, 04/28/2002,Milwaukee Lincoln LS V8,3,"1. Had a very poorly shifting 
transmission, I took six months of 
complaining to the dealer, to the Ford 
Company directly, and then finally to 
the Lemon Law process to get the 
transmission fixed. The transmission 
works well now.
2. Was plaged by electrical problems 
that made the Lincoln just quit while 
driving. Requiring a tow from the 
Lincoln sponsored service. (It took 2.5 
hours to get to me) The dealer finally 
found ""loose ground screws"". That 
appears to have solved the problem.
3. Developed a very bad oil leak from 
the power steering assembly. the dealer 
fixed it by replacing a 
deffective ""quick change coupling""
4. Misc. I would feel safer if the 
Lincoln had other tires that Firestone."
lincoln,ls,2001,jjj, 05/15/2002,Great Car,5,"I compared it to BMW, Lexus and 
Mercedes.  It was a much better value.  
I got an American car with better

$10k less.  I can also find my car in 
the parking lot because there aren't 
1000 others just like it."
lincoln,ls,2001,Razbo, 04/29/2009,This car has guts,4,"Love this vehicle.  It's a muscle car disguised as a sedan.  Quiet, comfortable ride.  The luxury you'd expect from a Lincoln but this car moves.  No major problems/repairs.  I'm passing this car down to my daughter soon and I'm going to miss it.  "
lincoln,ls,2001,John from Cincinnati, 01/16/2008,Keep Duct Tape Handy,4,"Most of the time, I have truely enjoyed this vehicle. It was 3 years old when I purchased it, but only had 4,500 miles, so was almost like new. It is a very quiet car and comfortable.   My major ""beef"" is with the window regulators. I have needed to have all four rebuilt! You can be driving along when a window simply falls down, off the track. I keep duct tape handy so I can tape the glass back up until the dealer repairs it again. Lincoln will not admitted that they have a serious design flaw. Very disappointing. No more Lincoln's for me!"

vehicle was delivered with. paint 
quality very poor. my local dealer 
takes numerous service attempts to do 
anything.  then accomplishes nothing. 
if this is LINCOLN'S new vehicle for my 
generation. car quality needs to be 
much better, and dealer support needs a

lincoln,ls,2001,Dan Vital, 07/07/2002,Most Drive/Buy,4,"Exceptional!!  Having been a Lincoln 
owner for 18 plus years, I personally 
think they got it right.  We car 
searched and test-drove many cars above 
and below the LS class.  I avoided the 
V8 because in my research I read that 
the LS was designed around the V6 for 
maximum performance and efficiency.  
Besides, what will 30 additional horses 
do, 0-60 in 6.7 vs. 6.9?  I do not 
think there is a better dollar to 
performance/comfort ratio out there. 
Cannot say enough about how happy we 
are. :) Lincoln put the fun back into 
an auto line of sophisticated American 
luxury!"
lincoln,ls,2001,Ash, 07/11/2002,Solid Performer,4,"I wanted an understated, luxury 
sedan with all of the finishing 
touches.  The LS is fits the role.  
Lincoln did a good job on this auto.  
One trip to the dealer to replace the 
rear window lift mechanisms - 
known defect.  The LS handles well, 
looks great and provides an high 
quality driving experience."
lincoln,ls,2001,P_Visser, 08/09/2002,Lincoln LS is a dream,4,"My Lincoln LS handles excellently, has 
a very comfortable cockpit and all the 
extras a person needs. Acceleration is 
outstanding as is cornering and 
braking. It is a bit light on the back 
end but a bag of sand in snow makes it 
very responsive with the independent 
traction option."

great combination of luxury, 
sportiness, and performance."
lincoln,ls,2001,MB1, 09/18/2002,Review,3,"Comfortable and attractive, but with 
build quality that Ford should be 
ashamed of. Have owned Lexus in the

lincoln,ls,2001,Johnny , 09/16/2002,Very nice car,4,"I have owned my LS now for about 11 
months and have loved it from the 
start - exceptional handling and sharp 
looking for an American 4d sedan.  
However, I probably would not consider 
this car again.  For $40k I expect more 
than what I got - performance, service, 
sound system, features, attention to 
details on fit and finish.  Lincoln 
just does not provide a reason for me 
to buy another one in 6-8 years."

Minor problem with engine sensor, that was replaced without hassle by excellent dealer.  Compared with Jag S type and XJ8, and Lexus prior to purchase.  LS is far better value for the money than the Jag.  Compared with Lexus, LS is more fun to drive."

My wife likes the attactive body and interior while I like the power and handling.  I systematically test drove competing cars over the same test loop (yes, I am an engineer) and the LS was far superior to all but the much more expensive BMW 5-series in power and handling.  America can compete."

In March 05 and been having trans problems, (it likes to shift to neutral when coming to a stop while still in drive!!! at cold startup) Also, the rack and pinion seeps fluid, the alignment is shaky, and the motor misfires horribly.  It's not over yet!  My door handle won't open the driver's door from the inside.  I have to roll my window and open it from the outside.  This is not pleasant during the winter... I still owe 12,500 on the darn thing... I'm looking to trade it off.   Oh and the chrome wheels are peeling terribly near the centercaps.

suprised with the Lincoln LS V8.  The 
LS I bought satisfied all I was 
looking for: comfort, luxury
smooth but fun to drive, and good 
value for a used car. All this coming 
from an Infinti enthusiast since 
owning a J30 and I30 recently. After 
getting over the connotation of 
the name ""Lincoln"" as my grandfather's 
car, I feel in love with my first 
American made auto.  The features it 
offers rival the best of the European 
luxury sedans, with a much better 
price tag. I think it has a 
sophisticated yet subtle body design- 
I dare to say even elegant."

experienced constant problems for the 
first two years ranging from interior 
material quality to wind 
noise,constant steering vibration, 
brake problems etc. Trips to Service 
Department were multiple and constant 
due to the very low quality of work 
performed. Misdiagnosting the problems 
and ordering wrong parts were of 
frequent nature. Vehicle was 
constantly returned to me in a messy

a reliable, fun-to-drive, comfortable 
car that competes well with foreign 
makes.  I do have a few complaints,

back against a 5 series, E-class, 
expecting not to be impressed.  But 
found a more assured chassis than M-B, 
handling as aggressive as the BMW, and 
less road noise than either. This is a 
stealth premium car.  Everything a BMW 
5 series or an E-class has in terms of 
engineering and competence with none of 
their BS fake prestige, psuedo-
snobbery, and overpriced pretense. "
lincoln,ls,2001,FormerLincolnLover, 08/08/2004,Disappointed Owner,3," Almost every item listed in tech
bulletins applies to this vehicle. 
Frequent chimes with no read out, 
automatic windshield washer functions
according to the mood of the car,
sometimes comes on on a bright sunny day
for a couple of swipes, frequently needs
a boost to begin operation in the rain.
 Engine light, check Advance Trac and
Cabin Filter lights often show, moisture
in headlights. Re-setting a computer
seems to be the standard answer.
Steering column assembly had to be
replaced because of worn bearings.  One
sway bar broken, other replaced because
of excessive wear of bolts.  Trunk lid
and left rear door were out of line.
Because of this auto has only 18000 miles. "
lincoln,ls,2001,maferwin, 08/04/2004,Good but could be great,4,"This LS with a V8 is a powerful, well 
balanced car. However, the front is 
only comfortable if you are under 6 
feet tall. The leg room in a long trip 
makes you wish you had walked there
The front seats could have been made a 
little bit plusher and the design 
should allow for a bit more room on 
the ""wings"" that ""hold"" you in place. 
So when one gets in the leather is not 
scratched with your left back pocket.
Other than that, the car is fairly 
well built. Of course is Ford made so 
you don't get the finished that you 
find on a comparable car of European 
descent or even Cadillac.

quiet.  I'm waiting for a major body 
change on the LS before I purchase 
another one.  You can bet I'll get the 
premium sound system and the sports 
package.  I have had no problems with 
my LS.  I drive it hard and really use 
the brakes....which had to be replaced 
at 35K....which was covered under the 
warranty.  Otherwise no repairs!  It 
is every bit as good as a BMW, Lexus

I don't even think about it being 6 years old. It's always been fun to drive - comfortable, quiet, quick, and nimble. My wife is always trying to take it away from me. I don't know what else to say. Originally bought it over a Jag X-type which was smaller and pricier for comparable features. My LS is loaded with everything but heated seats (not needed in the South).

offered me another model of the same car
in a 2001 version. I excepted. This is a
wonder if it had some more get up and

It is very comfortable (even with the

is powerful and I get 17MPG in city 
driving."
lincoln,ls,2001,pcard, 06/25/2003,Almost There.,4,"Lincoln has finally made a car and not 
a boat.  The LS gives you the feel of a 
European sports sedan at a substantial 
discounted price.  However, the car 
suffers from small but irksome 
problems.  City mileage is lousy.  Back 
windows tend to breakdown with minimal 
use.  Front headlight covers may 
collect moisture.  Fortunately the 
dealers were easy to work with and 
there have been no repeat problems 
after repairs were made. Car also tends 
to be resistant to downshifting."

Certified Pre-Owned vehicle. I 
received an excellent price and an 
exceptional car. Though my friends say 
it does not compare to their Lexus ES

Handling and cabin noise-level are 
especially impressive, considering the 
fact that my 8-cylinder engine 
produces much more horsepower and 
torque than their Lexus engines. All 
of the luxury features I desired were 
present, including moisture-sensitive

There are few minor problemsthey are covered under warranty and will be fixed when we return the vehicle for its complementary oil change.  We used CarFax to research its historythus ensuring a safe purchase.  Our LS has extremely responsive steering.  Good road feel.  The seating is *very* comfortable.  The car is very quickwith the refinement of a Lincoln.  Absent is the noise and road-roughness usually associated with quick vehiclesmaking it paramount to pay attention to that speedometer.  We are experiencing 18-19 mpg city and 22-25 mpg highway.  Overall, this car is a lot of fun to drive."

The fuel economy is not the best, but then again it is a V8. I average anywhere from 13-15 mpg city, and 17-22 mpg highway on 91 octane fuel. In this past year I've change all four tires, rear brakes and rotors, alternator, air filter, cabin filter, and a few bulbs. Now I have to fix both front upper control arms,spark and coil plugs,and clock-spring. I purchased this car with 167k miles, so obviously repairs were expected, but I now have 183k. That's 16k miles in one year, I like to drive a lot. I use Pennzoil Synthetic Blend 5W-30 instead of 5W-20, it runs much smoother. Overall a good car. "
lincoln,ls,2002,likeusluxury, 07/29/2012,Great Car,4,"My 2nd LS. I had a 2004 LS. I bought a 2002 LS for my daughter. Bought both used. Highly recommend. My daughter loves her car. Fun to drive. Highly reliable. Safe. 

Between the 2 cars have over 100,000 miles with only one issue at all. If you can get one, get it. You will not be sorry."
lincoln,ls,2002,Kristy, 07/09/2010,"I love it, but it's cursed",4,"Keep in mind, I have bought it with 178,000 miles on it at a very good price. Nothing but problems so far. I have barely been able to drive it. The transmission was bad. Replaced rack and pinions, all front control arms, hydraulic fan, hydraulic pump, power steering pump, and driver's side window regulator. I'm hoping after the control arms are replaced I will be able to finally drive it. Plus, my air bag light is on. Also, my check engine light is on due to a leak in a HVac hose somewhere. All I say is keep up with the maintenance on this car."
lincoln,ls,2002,vkmaxima, 12/21/2012,First Lincoln!,3,"Couldn't afford my 2005 Nissan Maxima anymore (stay away from that car). I needed something inexpensive, and so I found this 2002 Lincoln LS V8 with 167k on it for $4500. The ride is very smooth and comfortable. It has plenty of get up and go. I've never driven a V8 before, and boy do I love it!!! Even though it's 10 years old, plenty of people compliment how good it looks. A few things don't work like my heater, rear defroster, and horn(clock-spring). I think an engine mount is broken,because there's a slight bump into reverse. Other than that she runs/shifts smoothly. It does require premium fuel,and I get about 14-18 city, and 23-27 hwy. It's a pretty rare car,which makes me like it more."
lincoln,ls,2002,Terran 'papabur' Schatz, 07/31/2016,"So many lemons, finally.. a peach! @<3myLSE",5,"The sports package edition(aka the LSE) are V8's...just so everyone knows..if you see a spoiler and a sunroof, its most likely the V8 sports edition (LSe)

I personally have owned a 2002 Lincoln LSE(yep, sports package, with rims-sun roof-etc) since 2011 and it has by far been one of the most enjoyable vehicles I've owned. When i went to test drive this car, I was ready to give up for the day as I had already looked/test drove 15+ other cars throughout the day. She was hidden, in the back of the car lot..like a black stallion calmly awaiting its master..it called to me. Per the usual, I asked to test drive her and was handed the keys. Once I hit the key fob, the interior lights came on as I was approaching the driver side door and I could see the interior through the light tinted windows...leather..wood grain..""Yep, its a Lincoln."" I said to myself and popped the door open to climb in. First off, the heated leather bucket seats are by far the most comfortable I have ever had the pleasure of owning....after a minute or two of taking it all in..enjoying the smell of the leather..all the fun buttons n gadgets..something magical happened..I put the key in and all of the sudden my seat is moving@! and the steering wheel moves out(tords you) and down, perfectly in front of me!!! At this point, I come back down to earth, and growing up with a mechanic, I instantly start disecting...                                                                    93k miles showed on the meter..everything worked(electronically), Oil preasure was good..Temp was holding steady, idle sounded like a cute lil kitten, purring its way through a Milo and Ottis dream..too good to be true...too goo to be true is all I kept telling myself.   I barely even got the car off the lot when I knew...I had to have it...considering the money came from my grandfather passing away, I felt like this was the car he would have wanted me to get.  So, I paid $6500 cash and drove it off the lot right then n there and haven't looked back since. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, I bought the vehicle in 2011 with roughly 95k miles and other then common maintance, have not had any major issues with this vehicle..well other then that stupid AdvancTrac bullshit that likes to beep for like 5 minutes everytime I start the car...other then that, the car has been a tank for me and I constantly drive back and forth to/from Portland OR. to Spokane WA. and again, the comfort of this vehicle on the highway is par to none...rides very smoothly with its equal 50/50 front/back weight ratio (...hince why the battery is in the trunk!) and loves to hug corners! I highly recommend this car to anyone, young or old, who is just looking for a comfortable, nice looking ride that can pass everything but a gas station!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Strong Ford motors...and as far as people complaining about electrical stuff going out...thats because they either mistreated the car in bad weather, etc. OR they are just lazy and rather come complain on a forum then actually look into addressing the issues (such as windows coming off track..) Most of the electrical work can be done fairly easy...anyways, hope you traded for the LS!! :D"
lincoln,ls,2002,Brit, 02/02/2016,NOT A GOOD CHOICE.. and its sad,3,"I have been crushing on this particular car since the early 2000's when I was in junior high. Finally I got old enough, but not smart enough to go out and pick out my own car.. I have had it for a year now.. and Ive had many problems with it. The inside is falling apart.... (air vents...driver heated seat..door control panel...) the 2 driver side windows have quit working and they're both off track.. The heater doesnt blow very warm, esp on the driver side and the a/c quits after getting up to about 35-40 mph and it doesnt work at all on the passenger side. The radio...well the speakers are magnificent! The cd player hasnt worked since I bought it. Lets see.. The battery is huge and its located in the trunk... had to have new breaks over the summer- which those are normal replacement parts on any vehicle. Had to have the water pump replaced.  I have recently had to replace the power steering pump and let me tell you, it was a job and a half getting that done, the location on the darned thing was horrible.. I've been having trouble with the jewel shifting out of 1st gear properly... The car started missin' after I got it... and the gas miliage has since then been horrible.. i am lucky to get 10 mpg.  Oh yeah ..there's something going on with the advance trac mode/deal.. that and the break light sometimes stay on after starting the car..I just shut off and turn it back on til they are not there.  There isnt really anything too normal about this car, but I guess thats a ""Lincoln Lesson"" for ya. Anyhow the body on the car is super cute in my opinion, and like I said the radio sounds great but only makes for an expensive looking radio... and if youre looking for a car, remember any of these that are actually left on the road today.. will only wind up being left on the road.. :-( Ive still got mine simply because right now its my only option.. too bad I dont have one in my yard I could use for parts... But then again, there wouldn't be...because they're all junk.. lemons, i tell ya... and it certainly is a heartbreaker... she aint worth a dang, but boy she's pretty.  Now i gotta go, time for me to take it and have the oil changed and a tire rod end replaced.

Everything is very costly. My car needs repairs that cost well over 2000 dollars and the stupid car is only worth 1800!  I do not recommend anyone purchasing this car."
lincoln,ls,2002,Joe Glotz, 07/31/2009,"Great road car, highly reliable",4,"Base V6, purchased new, June 2002. Trouble free since. It's a great long- distance road car, ok as daily driver.  Great handling, great suspension, great brakes. Ok engine.  Transmission has to think a lot; upshifts are ok, but it positively cringes at even the hint of a downshift. Over-the-road mileage is 22-23, commuting is about 19.  Supposed to use 91 Octane gas."
lincoln,ls,2002,Steve Bullock, 02/01/2019,Best car I ever owned!,4,"I bought my 2002 new, well it has a few hundred dealer miles on it, so I got a great price. I have driven it almost every day since then. For the year, it came with everything you could get on it but a built in phone which my company provided anyway. 64 round trip miles Monday thru Friday to the office. Customer visits, short trips, everywhere but the left coast. I had the PCM tweeked a little by a nearby racing shop and get 30+ on the highway wth 27 more Dyno tested horses. It will scoot! I’m retired now and don’t drive it as much but when cleaned up it looks new inside and out. My friends and neighbors are astounded by the way it still looks at 18. The paint glistens, I had the parking lot dings removed by an expert, you could park it on a showroom floor. I only had one real problem with it and the 100K maintenance took care of that, putting in a new trans, as I had been towing a trailer that was too heavy, not the vehicles fault. Ford did good on this one. A Keeper! I could not get your website to cooperate, so the “select a year” does not work. Clearly the number is 2002. Almost forgot, but synthetic oil is a winner! Useitevery time you change your oil.

It is sporty and is so pretty when it is all cleaned up. The V-8 makes for wonderful performance.

It is stunning to look at and comming from a background of sports cars it is a super fun car to drive. Heads turn when people see this car comming down the road. There is a huge ""but"" in the midst of all of the things I love about this car! I have had to replace the window motor on the drivers side twice and the passenger side once. I have had gaskets replaced, coils 1,3,5 & 8 replaced and still have 4 more to go but can only get them replaced as they go out. The sun roof leaks but the crazy twist is that it fills up the pocket on the passenger door! I truly hate to get rid of the car but the repair costs are killing me!!!!!"
lincoln,ls,2002,Lincoln JC, 04/27/2009,My LS,2,Bought the LS V8 three years ago and loved it in the begining. Start by saying I will never by a lincoln LS again. With a small block V8 didnt think the milage would be this horrible. The K&N filter did help out with more horse power and gas milage. Had to return the car the first week I had it cause of faulty power packs whatever replaced the spark plugs. That cost the dealer over 500 dollars. Transmission is HORRIBLE! after the warrenty company replaced it with brand new trans. Im still having problems. Cost me over 700 to replace alternator. 1200 in tires and window brackets 280 for only one door I have yet to replace the second rear window. would not recommend the Lincoln LS people.
lincoln,ls,2002,GUT, 07/19/2009,Good Car - Great Value,3,"As my 2nd LS, the 2002 has been a workhorse.  I have had it for seven years, now, and never had many problems with it.  The electrical system has had its problems, over the years, but it has always been underr warranty and never been a severe problem.  For those who bought a 5- series BMW, you could have saved your money and had a better vehicle.  I would buy it again, if Ford hadn't stopped making them!  In case you are wondering why the American auto manufacturers can't survive - look no further than this decision!"
lincoln,ls,2002,bigpoppa, 12/03/2009,"Good looking, comfortable cruiser",4,"I purchased my 02' V8 in May of 09'. Only 58k on the odometer at the time, and the previous owners seemed to take good mechanical care of it.  It is a great looking car!  Shine it up and take it for a cruise on a sunny afternoon and it still turns a few heads.  Clean lines and a classic ""Euro"" look means it has aged very well, compared to something like the CTS.  I find the ergonomics/levels of comfort perfect for my 6'2"" figure, but as others have said, the interior materials need more refinement.  The ride is smooth on most surfaces, but gets uncomfortable over rough pavement. Performance is good, can't go wrong with the ol' V8/RWD setup.  Fast depreciation makes for a good used value."
lincoln,ls,2002,KHoffman, 03/01/2010,"So Far, So Good!",4,"I've had my Lincoln LS for one year now and have had no problems whatsoever. The 252 HP V8 delivers very good acceleration and passing other cars is a breeze. Fuel economy is the car's one weak spot. The transmission is smooth shifting (nearly as smooth as my old Buick Regal) and throttle input is good. I bought the LSE trim which has a firmer suspension than the standard LS, so road imperfections are more noticable, but the ride is by no means harsh. The trunk is large enough, but fairly shallow. Even though the design is conservative, it still gets attention from onlookers because there are so few on the road. The LS is everything a luxury car should be. "
lincoln,ls,2002,ls1bmw0, 02/27/2002,Love My Early Build 10/99 LS!,4,"I purchased my 2000 LS in October 1999. It was an early build model built in July 1999. I have 68,000 miles on it and it has been the most trouble-free car I have owned. Power is adequate, roominess is larger than a BMW 5-series, and the handling is phenomenal! For a car this size it handles like a much smaller German sports sedan.

I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a luxury sports sedan."

to get a burger.  I call it the mafia 
mobile, for I had the LSE's windows 
tinted, and it has the mysterious, yet 
seductive look about it.  The power is 
satisfactory.  The exterior design is 
one of the most beautiful cars on the 
road.  The interior is nice, too, but 
the glove compartment and inside 
storage leave much to be desired in 
size. I have driven a Jaguar S Type.

The most impressive aspect of the LS is its superior handling characteristics, especially in cornering and emergency avoidance maneuvers.   The LS's Advance Trac system combined with winter tires enables the vehicle to climb all of Pittsburgh's snowy hills without trouble. The performance from the V6 is more than adequate, and the transmission shifts smoothly and flawlessly, even in our hilly terrain.  After owning very acceptable vehicles such as Avalons and Camrys, I strongly believe the Lincoln LS is the most reliable and enjoyable vehicle I have owned. "
lincoln,ls,2002,Mike Stelmasky, 03/04/2017,Black Beauty,5,"This is a very safe automobile!! Our 2000 LS got hit by a 65 F150 EXTENDED Cab, at a Police estimated 55mph, while we were standing still. The trunk took the brunt of the energy and the top did ripple a little, but we walked away without a scratch. Because of the performance of the 2000 we went out and bought a 2002. There are 97,000 miles on it now and we had the coils replaced once and the connection from the seatbelt to the airbags under the driver side seat repaired, to stop the warning light from blinking by someone other then the Ford-Lincoln dealer, they ripped us off once on an overheating problem, they misdiagnosed it the first time as a thermostat (and replaced and charged us for replacing it) when it was the hydraulic solenoid for the fan (which they knew nothing about and charged us for diagnostic time, and said ""You know that this is a Jaguar?"") and overcharged us by double, we will never go back there again. The car looks like it just came out of the showroom and gets a lot of attention. It handles like a roller-skate, rides like a dream and accelerates way better then you would expect!!

Second, i had a engine misfire (which is a common problem on this vehicle) had to replace 3rd coil, all spark plugs and both value covers which cost $1100. Last, my airbag light came on and it cost another $1000 to repair. I took the car to the Ford dealership for service and repair.

Ford refuses to fix the leaking gaskets unless the owner specifically complains and even then they will only fix the side where the coil goes bad even if both sides leak. '03 and '04 models have a CSP from Ford extending warranty to 10yr./100000 mi. Owners of the '01 and '02 LS's need to start complaining to Ford. I hear that the V-6 also has this problem."

new, and the car's styling standout in 
Beverly Hills as well as the desert 
highways."
lincoln,ls,2002,Mr. Lincoln, 05/12/2002,The New Ultimate Driving Machine,5,"This is my fourth and favorite Lincoln! 
I had a 95 Mark VIII, 98 Mark VIII LSC, 
01 LS V6, and now a LSE V8. It is by 
far the best car I have ever owned!"
lincoln,ls,2002,RazorUte, 01/04/2008,Sports Coupe in a Sedans Body,4,I recently purchased this vehicle and really have enjoyed it.  I swore that I would never buy a Ford.  Well....this is the best Ford I have ever sat in.  It is fun and has plenty of stock power.  Handling is great.  The radio and cruise controls on the steering wheel don't always function properly.  A few other issues but overall this a great car.
lincoln,ls,2002,DinoDon, 06/04/2002,Happy Lincoln Owner,4,"Absolutey a kick to drive, drives like 
a large sports car. It is extremely 
tight and quiet, and we love the 
throaty sound of the V6. Don't need the 
v8 and I have raced cars. The ultimate 
sports luxury car. We tested bmw, 
lexus, accura, and others, but this was 
the best bang for the buck."
lincoln,ls,2002,Fingerd, 06/09/2002,Awesome,5,"I bought my LS in March, '02 about 120 
miles from home. Incredibly fun to 
drive. On a recent trip in the 
mountains, my 3 passengers were hanging 
on for life, but the LS hugged the 
curves as if at home.  I'm still 
breaking it in, but get >26 mpg on the 
interstate.
Each time my wife rides in it, she 
comments on the smooth ride."
lincoln,ls,2002,Deb, 07/17/2009,LOVE This Car!,5,"Bought new, hitting 115,000 miles now, and still going strong.  It is a beautiful car inside and out.  I keep thinking it's getting old and maybe I need to replace it, but I can't find a comparable car in size, quality, luxury features, comfort, performance, and ""reasonable cost"" anywhere.  The seats are also extremely comfortable - even on very long rides.  It also has the ""get up and go"" needed when you're entering highways, passing, etc.  I have always kept it up, and I still get many compliments on it's look/style.  I really wish Lincoln would come out with this again."
lincoln,ls,2002,RCC, 06/11/2002,Great Car,4,"I love my Lincoln.  The power is 
adequate and the comfort is 
exceptional.  I am looking forward for 
an improved power version of this 
vehicle in the future (320 - 350 horse 
power)."
lincoln,ls,2002,MF, 01/22/2010,Very satisfied with the Car,4,"We use this car for trips and Church mostly, no problems since we've had it. The pick and power are a joy from start to finish of the trip. One knock is the cheep center console Linciln used which cries every time you lean on it with your elbow. Other than that no complaints at all."
lincoln,ls,2002,Mr Lincoln, 07/06/2002,Lincoln LS Rules!,4,"The Lincoln LS is a awesome machine 
hands down and if you don't think so 
it means you haven't ever driven one...

The handling is great, power is good 
from the V8, it looks great...

Yes, of course there can be 
improvements - and we all know about 
the interior storage, cupholders, 
armrest, yes the trunk hinges get in 
the way - but overall a 9 out of 10..."
lincoln,ls,2002,MM LS in DC, 07/15/2002,MM LS Shows Potential for Ford,4,"This is a wonderful car with some 
flaws. I too have had problems with the 
rear passenger window not rolling up, 
heated seats went out. The paint job 
could have been better. Overall though 
I love my LS. It's Black with blacked 
out windows, high profile spoiler and 
beautiful rims. Handles like a dream. I 
do have a hesitation in shifting from 
2nd to 3rd. Even with the select shift, 
the car will shift into 3rd at 3500 
rpms and then drop back into 2nd for a 
split second. In addition there is a 
strong smell of gas when tank is 
completely full."

miss the SHO this is a fun car drive. 
Neighbor with a 99 BMW 525 was 
impressed with the LS. I prefer to 
compare to the SHO. Love it so far hope 
it is a good car. Considered the Lexus

additional power and handling."

its was an amazing car, but as time 
wore on, so did the quality and 
transmission. the LS had very little 
reliability, ihad to return my car to 
the daleship for repairs about six 
times- about three times to fix the ac, 
once for stuck windows, once for broken 
interior locks, and another time for 
engine problems. as a driver, i amvery 
disapointed in the build and quality of 
this car."
lincoln,ls,2002,Longtime Ford man, 08/25/2002,First impressions of 2002 LS8 Sport,4,"First impression after owning my 2002 
LS8 sport one week and driving it 600 
miles. I have experimented with the 
SelectShift transmission in various 
situations and so far it has performed 
well. I have not experienced the 
problems that I see mentioned 
frequently in reviews. If I shift it 
as one would normally do with a manual 
when RPMs are at a reasonable level, 
it reacts without delay and shifts 
smoothly. Even when shifting more 
aggressively, the transmission 
performs well."
lincoln,ls,2002,texmln, 09/07/2002,Best car for the money,4,"Put this car's specs up side by side 
with the BMW 5 Series or the MB C 
Class (or even the E Class) and you'll 
find that it costs $10k less, has more 
engine and horsepower, AND is bigger 
inside and out than even the E Class.  
Get in and drive it and you'll find an 
excellent riding and handling car with 
plenty of power.  I am very happy with 
my choice. However, the transmission 
keeps this car from being a true 
sports car.  It doesn't have a 
problem, it just isn't made for sporty 
driving.  Likewise with the V8.  Lots 
of power but no real ability to put it 
on the ground all at once.  All 
around, this car beats anything on 
wheels in value for your dollars."
lincoln,ls,2002,phantom, 09/12/2002,"Finally, Sporty American Luxury",4,"This is a great looking car that does 
not disappoint when you drive it. I 
have the V-6 and don't feel like I'm 
missing any power.  It's just as 
smooth at 100mph as it is at 50mph. 
Very quiet ride that is a joy to 
drive. The only downside I can find is 
the lack of rear leg room. Makes you 
proud to be an American."
lincoln,ls,2002,Jasen, 09/16/2002,My New LSE Flat Out ROCKS!,4,"Had a few as rentals over the past year 
and was more than impressed, time and 
time again. 

Last time I drove it, decided to turn 
in the keys of my BWM 535i. 

More than happy with this car. Ford has 
done an amazing job in putting this 
together. Keep finding more and more 
people features that amaze me and how 
this car was thought out. Amazing 
performance as well. Love driving this 
more than the BMW."
lincoln,ls,2002,Chip Nickolett, 09/28/2002,Almost perfect,4,"Overall I am very happy with this 
car.

The interior layout is pretty good, but 
there are a few buttons that are hidden 
by the steering wheel.  The radio would 
be easier to use if it was angled 
slightly towards the driver.

The biggest surprise was the little 
things that should have been caught in 
the factory.  There was a small grinder 
mark in a corner on the hood, there is 
a slight amount of welding splatter 
under the driver door handle, and the 
alignment of the body side molding is 
not perfect on one piece.

It's the little things that Lincoln 
could improve upon in order to better 
compete with the German and Japanese."
lincoln,ls,2002,johnny boy, 10/29/2002,ls,4,"overall, i am pleased. there are few 
concerns i have. there is not much 
interior space for storing things

smooth as i thought, but then again, 
this is a sport car and not the lincoln 
town car"
lincoln,ls,2002,ccarl1, 10/25/2002,Love my LS,4,"Congrats to Lincoln on a great attempt 
to compete w/ the Germans.  This car 
is fun, looks great, and is 
very comfortable.  Only serious 
gripes are with the V6, fake wood, 
vinyl for seatbacks and headrests, and 
a small paint match flop. My 3.0 V6 
and Getrag Manual is underpowered for 
this 4000lb car. The manual makes up 
for some of the V6's shortcomings.  
This car has a clean interior that's 
easy to use and easy on the eyes. One 
ext flop, my body paint doesn't quite 
match the fascia's. I have the Silver 
Birch and when the sun hits the side of 
the car, there's a difference in the 
amount of metallic in the body paint 
compared to fascia paint."

lincoln,ls,2002,Peter , 02/27/2002,2001 LS V6 Auto,4,"The LS is a great car, I have very few complaints other that the V6 with auto is a bit underpowered. I just don't feel a real punch from it. Also the steering is a little too overassisted for my tastes, I prefer a little better road feel. Starting the car presents another problem not just with mine either, all LS's almost never start on the first try in a cold start. It takes some cranking. Cornering ablilty is top notch however and everything else about the car is wonderful."
lincoln,ls,2002,ak, 02/27/2002,THE NEW AMERICAN LUXURY CAR,5,Ecellent ride/performance. You get your bang for the buck. The only other comparable car is the BMW 540I which sells for 55000.

It is the best value for the money for a near-luxury sport sedan.  Gas mileage-27 mpg @ 79+ highway.  Comfortable with many nice interior touches.  Race-derived suspension and power to spare. It will be replaced at lease-end with another LS."

lincoln,ls,2002,Ringmaster, 03/01/2002,2002 LS SPORT,4,"We purchased our LS Sport in October after looking at BMWs etc.  We are totally happy about the decision to do the LS.  It is the best handeling highway/back road automobile I have ever driven.  I really feel the LS is a sleeper, a BMW on steriods at a $15K -$20K savings. Maybe more considering it has the wheelbase of a 7 series.  I'll give up that last 10th of performance and luxury and with the savings get off the road on weekends and go sailing with the money I saved."

lincoln,ls,2002,norminator, 01/21/2003,This car blows.,2,"It sucks.  It's the B-team vehicle at 
the A-team price.  There's no interior

unreliable.  It gets bad gas mileage.  
It's run out of gas on me twice

lincoln,ls,2002,akirby, 03/01/2002,V8 Sport,4,"This car is pure driving pleasure.  It handles great, has plenty of room
(for four), has lots of amenities and truly comfortable seats.  I find myself
making excuses to drive to the store - it's that much fun.  V8 power is great
although it launches a little slower than I would like.    It plays the role of 
highway cruiser and hot rod equally well.
It's hard to find a better value in this segment.  Highly recommended."
lincoln,ls,2002,mwsouth, 03/01/2002,LS Sport V8,3,"The Lincon LS is a car that has been overlooked by 
the public thanks to Lincolns poor job of advertising and promoting car. 
I have been stopped numerous times ith people asking me what car is that
. It is understated, extremely comfortable and fun to drive. Lincoln has called
 me three times so far to see how I like the car."
lincoln,ls,2002,KAL, 01/26/2003,Hot Rod Lincoln,4,"Can't find a single flaw so far.This

lincoln,ls,2002,spjdcb, 03/03/2002,Lincoln LS a Joy to Have!,4,I am thoroughly enjoying LS.  The car rides like BMW 5 or Jag S (it is on same platform) but is 10K to 15K cheaper.
lincoln,ls,2002,larryd187, 02/17/2003,2002 v8 sport,4,"We really enjoy this car. It has 
everything we wanted. It handles well 
in corners and cruises down the open 
road at ease. It's real easy to be 
going 80MPH before you relize it. The 
stereo is outstanding, except for the 
over powering sub-woofers in the rear. 
The www.llsoc.com website (Lincoln LS 
owners club) was very helpful and 
continues to be, with all the little 
quirks that happen from time to time.

lincoln,ls,2002,anc, 03/03/2002,windows,4,the exact same thing happened to my rear windows as the previous review. The windows have been fixed 4 times-first it was a cable then the dealer said an electronic sending unit. No matter the building quality is still ford.
lincoln,ls,2002,SRW, 08/13/2003,2002 LS,2,"I own a 2002 LS. I haven' t had any 
major problems. One of the 
headlights hold condensation 
constantly. The dealership would not 
replace it cause Lincoln is trying to 
perfect the part. It has been this way 
for over a year. Very annoying. The 
tires make loud noises on different 
road surfaces. I was told that is 
normal LS noises. I should have 
bought an SUV. A Yukon XL does not 
make those noises."
lincoln,ls,2002,Vaughn, 03/26/2005,Lincoln LS,4,All around it's the best car I've owned. My biggest complaint is the size and placement of the cup holders.
lincoln,ls,2002,John , 05/29/2005,Poor Man's BMW,5,We were looking for a performance car with 4 doors and a V-8 to replace our aging Grand Marquis. We settled on the LS after our first test drive. The LS delivers when it comes to power and acceleration and gets decent gas mileage on the highway (24 MPG) and has all the creature comforts you would expect to find on a luxury sport sedan. I would compare it to a BMW 7 series in styling and performance for about half the price. There have been no problems since we had it and the bumper to bumper warranty with free maintenance has made the LS a worry free purchase. The 6 speed transmission shifts flawlessly under full power and the sound from under the hood tells you that this car is a beast!
lincoln,ls,2002,Love It, 07/23/2005,Love it,4,This car is everything!  It has speed and european styling.  Plus if you're buying used you can get a hell of a deal on them.
lincoln,ls,2002,DizWiz, 08/16/2005,Love My Hot Rod Lincoln,4,This car can get up and go! It is smooth to drive and handles like a dream. Three free years of oil changes and other normal mileage work helps too. The rear wheel drive gives great handling at all times. This car is my baby. I love my little black car. I hope to drive and enjoy this car for many years.
lincoln,ls,2002,scott5, 01/16/2004,Last Lincoln,2,"We liked the appearance of the new 
Lincoln LS so after years of repeat 
Toyota purchases we decided to try the 
Lincoln. A big mistake. We have the 
same problems with the headlight that 
everyone has mentioned in other 
reviews. The day we brought the car 
home as a new vehicle the remote door 
opener did not work. Plus, the windows 
will not roll down in the back and the 
power door lock on a back door is stuck 
so the door will not open.Of course the 
dealer wants a fortune to fix these 
defects. I expect better quality for a 
car of this price. Don't waste your 
money on this overpriced Ford product. 
Buy the Lexus or the Avalon."
lincoln,ls,2002,John Steinbruck, 02/25/2006,Three years later.,4,I was nervous at first because of its effeciency and responsiveness in steering  (it went exactly where one pointed).  It is tight and hugs the highway beautifully.  I drive no more than a few miles above limit and rest easy as the fools pass me at 80 and above! It also draws many compliments in the parking areas i visit.
lincoln,ls,2002,ronniepoh, 02/25/2004,2002 Lincoln LSE...American Advantage,4,"EXCELLENT vehicle.  Powerful, smooth V8 
power. EXCELLENT Chassis. (aluminum 
suspension really makes the car nimble 
and well balanced). Overall, it 
performs on par, if not better, than a 
BMW 5 series.  Reliability has been 
excellent. A highly under rated 
vehicle. I highly suggest driving one 
before purchasing any other sedan. "
lincoln,ls,2002,daviswj, 02/28/2004,wdavis,2,"Terrible gas mileage. Exterior 
temperatur gauge and compass do not

the ""seat that remembers"".  "
lincoln,ls,2002,Storm33, 03/19/2004,LS V6 Sport w/ Manual Trans,4,"I have been very impressed with the LS. 
I have owned Japanese & German sports 
cars in the past, and wanted something 
sporty AND classy - so I decided to try 
some Detroit steel for a change. 
Couldn't afford a V8, so I opted for 
the V6 w/5-spd manual, which helps in 
the performance area.  This car handles 
better than the VW GTI VR6 and the 
Nissan 300 I owned!  The LS corners 
like it's on rails, and the AdvanceTrac 
system is fantastic when you push it 
too far in a corner.  I have driven a 
530i since I owned my LS, and I 
definitely prefer the Lincoln. My next 
car will be the V8 Sport version, 
though. "
lincoln,ls,2002,Juleon, 05/11/2004,Depreciation,4,"I love this LSE, of course you can't 
find the LSE in the books. LSE has 
round fog lights, Aerodinamics around 
the car, 17 inch chrome wheels and 
chrome tail pipes. Very slick, but 
depreciates to fast that you do not 
want to buy another. The front light 
cover fogs when it rains not good for a 
for $44,000 vehicle. Also the 
depreciation on this vehicle is very 
bad two years later is only worth 
$16,000, so bad, so bad."
lincoln,ls,2002,hobby, 06/03/2004,"After 2 months, still love this car",4,"I recently purchased this vehicle used 
and was quite impressed with the 
power, comfort and handling of this 
car. The V8 spins up quickly and the 
car eagerly handles the twisties. I 
also like the elegant comfort of the 
leather seats. I don't know what else 
I could ask for. I was surprised that 
Lincoln could build such a nimble car 
with room for my family."
lincoln,ls,2002,Ducsman, 07/24/2004,No Real Problems,4,"I have had the LS since new almost two 
years and have had no problems. It in 
the V6, black (yes, it is a pain to 
keep clean) w/17 chrome wheels. I 
rarely go anywhere that someone does 
not comment about how good the car 
looks.  I would purchase another one. 
It is just fun to drive."
lincoln,ls,2002,Bob, 01/14/2005,Love It.. but...,4,"Great riding car, high comfort level, V6 had more then enough power and acceleration for Interstate driving. Low noise level, handling easy on the driver. Dislikes... The Shadow Red on Black instrument panel hard to read on bright sunny day. ""Eyes to road glance."" Large trunk, high lift and long reach to load and unload.  Trunk hinges take up trunk space.  Not a touring car."
lincoln,ls,2002,apdem, 02/19/2005,2002 Lincoln LS,4,"The car is wonderful.  The V6 has plenty of power and the handling is excellent.  The Alpine audio system is first rate.  Very comfortable interior, but could use more interior storage space."
lincoln,ls,2002,Troy Hamblin, 03/18/2005,2002 LSE Review,4,"This car has great acceleration with incredibly smooth automatic shifting. The traction control system is great in the winter in the midwest.  I was skeptical about it when I bought the car, but it has proved itself in the winters.  It is almost impossible to spin this car around in the snow under normal driving circumstances.  It has never happened to me. The car is also very quiet on the inside."
lincoln,ls,2002,Caponsacchi, 11/09/2005,Little Giant,4,"The best value in a used car. I paid less than half of the sticker price, and the car, with less than 30,000 miles, was mint.  I thought I'd wanted a bigger, flashier car--a 2002 Continental or a new Chrysler 300.  But both of these models felt clunky and were not much fun to drive.  The LS, though understated in exterior appearance, has a substantially longer wheelbase than the Continental.  It's trim in appearance, yet it dwarfs my wife's Maxima when they're side by side.

lincoln,ls,2002,adam nelson, 12/16/2005,a classy ride,4,i was a little worried at first because of all electrical components but after a short time the car seems to be well built. i am however concerned with the talk about the transmission being less than excellent.
lincoln,ls,2002,Dan Sullivan, 12/18/2005,Its A Great Car,5,"its a great car, it goes very fast and i like it a lot the only thing is that it is not good in the snow but other than that i love it, it has a v8 and a very nice interior and a nice exterior look"
lincoln,ls,2002,Brady, 01/13/2006,Smooth and still Sporty!,4,"I owned an Audi A4TQ and loved the quattro but was growing weary of the maintenance.  I was looking for a more comfortable ride without compromising sportiness, and a vehicle easier to maintain.  The LS has fit the bill perfectly.  I love the v8 power, and fuel economy has not been that bad.  I also really like the interior comfort of this car, and the seats are great.  The trunk could be a bit bigger.  The real test came driving across central Wisconsin in a blizzard.  I was cautious, but amazed at how well the rear-wheel drive and traction control handled the terrible road conditions (original Michelin Pilot with 30k miles).  The LS has so-far proven to be very reliable, fun and easy!"
lincoln,ls,2002,Michael Lawlor, 04/05/2006,Beware Long-Term owners of the LS!,3,"The long term ownership experience of this vehicle falls of rapidly.  This car is great for the first 2 years if you can put up with the lousy gas mileage.  Beyond that, you're taking your chances because the cost of ownership goes through the roof due to intermittent but nagging repairs."
lincoln,ls,2002,Michael, 07/29/2006,I expected nothing less from Lincoln,4,"I really enjoy this vehicle and have had no major problem out of it. I only drive it on trips and the performance is outstanding. The gas mileage is great on the road but around town not the best. I want a Town Car, which will provide the room I want."
lincoln,ls,2002,Rene, 10/09/2006,02 Lincoln LS,4,"My Lincoln LS V8 has been the best car I have ever owned.  At 68000 miles; it has yet to have one mechanical problem. I am still running on the original brakes, tires and battery - and all I've done is change the oil and rotate the tires as scheduled.  It has been a blast to drive.  When I bought it I was also considering the BMW 5 series and the Jaguar X and S Types.  I think I got the best bang for my buck.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a fun car to drive, lots of power, great handling - at a very reasonable price."
lincoln,ls,2002,craig, 11/25/2006,'02 LS Ohio,4,"I've been pretty happy with this car. One problem that worries me is the transmission, however.  We had problems at approx. 20k miles with it, and the dealer rebuilt it (warranty).  We now have 44K miles and the tranny is acting funny again.  It ""clunks"" when you shift from park to drive (occasionally, maybe once every other day).  There is no tranny dipstick to verify fluid level or color. Changing fluid looks like an ordeal, requiring special tools (read, costly).  Other than the tranny, the car has been good, and fun to drive.  This is the sport edition with V8."

to the ""fun to drive"" category.  It has 
excellent acceleration and corners like 
it's on rails, by far the best ""road"" 
car I've ever owned!

However, I don't think I've had a car 
with so many squeaks and rattles 
before.  The first ones started making 
noise at less than 1,000 miles, and 
it's only gotten worse...much worse!  

The fuel economy leaves a lot to be 
desired as well.  I have friends with 
4.6L Mustang GT's that get better, or 
at least similar, mileage than I do 
with this little 3.9L V8."

I have driven it almost every day since then. For the year, it came with everything you could get on it but a built in phone which my company provided anyway. 64 round trip miles Monday thru Friday to the office. Customer visits, short trips, everywhere but the left coast. I had the PCM tweeked a little by a nearby racing shop and get 30+ on the highway wth 27 more Dyno tested horses. It will scoot! I’m retired now and don’t drive it as much but when cleaned up it looks new inside and out. My friends and neighbors are astounded by the way it still looks at 18. The paint glistens, I had the parking lot dings removed by an expert, you could park it on a showroom floor. I only had one real problem with it and the 100K maintenance took care of that, putting in a new trans, as I had been towing a trailer that was too heavy, not the vehicles fault. Ford did good on this one. A Keeper! I could not get your website to cooperate, so the “select a year” does not work. Clearly the number is 2002. Almost forgot, but synthetic oil is a winner! Useitevery time you change your oil. Slight later update: “YOUR SELECT A YEAR” still does NOT WORK. PLEASE FIX.

lincoln,ls,2003,David E, 09/29/2010,Might have been good when new.,2,"I purchased my LS in June of 2009 for $7,000. I am going to give it to the local vo-tech because it has almost no trade in value and I can't imagine what private individual this car would be good for. Almost every month I have owned this car, I have had to repair something electronic. There are more $500 - $1000 gizmos on this thing than you can imagine. I had hoped that I was getting them all repaired and wouldn't have any more problems but I am starting to replace some things a second time. This car is extremely complex. Some of the parts are designed by Jaguar. When luxury features fail, you don't just lose the feature, you lose basic functions."
lincoln,ls,2003,cap223, 07/18/2012,Fun Car but TERRIBLE Build Quality,3,"How are there not more negative reviews? I owned this car until it was 8 years old and sold it. Right around the 80-90K mark, the Transmission gave out. I parked it for several months looking into the problem and found dozens of forums out there with hundreds of people reporting the same problems as mine: loss of 2nd gear and overdrive. I talked to many mechanics and they all had seen plenty of these cars come in because of a poor design by Ford, Lincoln, Mercury. These transmissions were used in the LS, Aviator, Mustang, and several others. The design is 2 servo pistons (steel) that go through the Transmission case which is soft Aluminum. Over time the opening gets bigger, losing 2 gears."
lincoln,ls,2003,eyerly, 06/19/2011,Everyone should drive this!,4,"This is truly an amazing car! I have yet to discover a flaw. My LS V8 has everything I could ask for and so much more. It's never given me problems and always gets me plenty of compliments. The look of the car is so classy and elegant. This car is a blast to drive, it's so quick and feels very sporty and luxurious. Why anyone would drive anything else baffles me. This car is perfect. I've driven many luxury cars and nothing compares! This car impresses everyone that sees it. Since I've had mine I have had at least 10 friends buy them because they envied mine. The Jones's wish they could keep up with me!"
lincoln,ls,2003,mec57, 10/27/2014,BMW and MB can't touch this car,5,"I've driven many luxury and near luxury cars in my adult life.  This includes several BMW and Mercedes Benz automobiles.  The Lincoln LS V8 was, by far, the best driving and best value of any vehicles in it's class at the time.  I understand people have had issues with transmissions, coils and electronics.  Honestly, I've had all of the coils replaced under a service bulletin.  The transmission valve body was also changed under a service bulletin.  Other than that, there have been nothing other than normal maintenance items.  In over 138K miles, I have only had to put one new set of brakes on the car and 2 sets of tires (I stuck with the Michelin OE because they lasted so long).

lincoln,ls,2003,Happy LS owner, 01/25/2006,Great Car,5,i'm on my second LS and consider it one of the best all-around cars i've owned which include BMW's and do not hesitate recommending it to others.  i've had only minor defects on the two i've owned both not requiring special trips into dealership.  highly recommend both as new or buying as used.
lincoln,ls,2003,tonyat, 12/02/2012,Appealing to the eye,4,"I purchased my car 2 months ago with 80,000 miles on it. The day after I got it, it wouldn't crank. I thought it was the battery. I got a jump and it worked with no problem. It did the same thing the very next day. I tried to get a jump but it wouldn't start. Found out the alternator was bad. I got that fixed. So now I'm noticing that sometimes when I put in in drive, it takes a while to shift and move. I don't know what's going on. I don't know anything about cars but that seems like something dealing with the transmission. After reading some of the other reviews, I'm starting to get worried. "

So much power, lots of room and very conservative styling, this car is not as flashy as the Jaguar it shares architecture with, but appears much more muscular and aggressive. The silver on black combination I have is beautiful and the cooled seats are awesome! The local dealer is very helpful and their service is reasonably priced and professional. This car has been exceptionally reliable and feels very sturdy. I just love it! "
lincoln,ls,2003,V8 in FL, 05/21/2005,Finally a good American Car,4,"Have put 40000 miles on my LS in 2 years.  It is great.

It still handles great, and i get about 20 MPG driving a mix of city and highway every day.  Just a great car."
lincoln,ls,2003,Rune47, 12/07/2009,"Love it , Love it, Love it!",5,"Yes, this car was built to compete with the European sport luxury sedans, and not only complete, they topped them! If not for the transmission it would have been top rated overall but slipped a bit as it's not so great at low rpms. But it is one of the smoothest transmissions you will operate and on the highway it shines! Great power @ upper speeds too! This car is rated as one of the TOP 5 safest cars of ALL TIME! I love it's understated elegance and the engineers put some work with the all aluminum fenders and hood and putting the battery in the trunk to acheive a 50-50 weight balance and is one of the reasons for the superior handling.

lincoln,ls,2003,James Holmgren, 01/11/2007,Great Little LS,4,As an Industrial Designer the styling of the LS was a big plus. The rear wheel drive handling was refreshing as was the V8 power.

then went back in for repairs for 
another 3 weeks. I just cannot tell you

lincoln,ls,2003,Peter, 10/25/2010,Unreliable Product,2,"The 2003 Lincoln LS V8 Sport is a very unreliable vehicle. A few days after I took the car home from the dealer 11/2009, all coils had to be replaced. Obviously free of charge since the car was covered under the NY Lemon law. I drove it for almost a year up 10/2010 when the coils appear to have failed again: the car is at a garage right now. I did manage to get 26,000 miles out of the last replacement. Otherwise I have the following issues with this car: A) it was built for people approximately 5"" tall: I get leg cramps driving long distance every day (I am 6"" tall) and B) it's road handling is really all over the place and dangerous in adverse weather (rain, snow)."

lincoln,ls,2003,joestephens3, 11/14/2002,Sheep in Wolves Clothing,3,"The Lincoln LS V8 in the sports 
pacakage is a potent little rocket, 
disguised as a family sedan. Under 
closer inspection, the big v8 under the 
hood shows its true colors. As with 
most American cars, build quality is of 
concern, but with the LS, it seems to 
be higher quality than makes from 
Chrysler and GM. In fact the interior 
is very German. The transmission is 
clunky at slower speeds, on the 
freeway, it's a different story, as 
this is the place where the LS stands 
it's own. The ability to maintain 80+ 
mph on mountain grades leaves many 
heads turned, in fact, 100, 120 would 
not be a problem for this car."

years, finally bought one. I wished I 
would have bought one sooner, the car 
is a lux hot rod. So far it has lived 
up to its billing. Just wished Lincoln 
would get the word out on this vehicle."
lincoln,ls,2003,Exit32, 02/18/2003,Better than ever!,4,"I owned a 2000 Lincoln LS V8 and loved 
that car. In fact, I bought a 2002 T-
Bird for my wife mainly because the new 
T-Bird is based on the LS platform. 
When I heard about the improvements on 
the 2003 LS (e.g., more power, THX 
audio, GPS navigation system), I was 
first in line at my Lincoln dealer and 
ordered a new 2003 LS in October, 2002. 
I took delivery on New Year's Eve and 
can confirm that my new LS is 
significantly better than my ""old"" LS. 
Responsiveness, steering precision, and 
ride comfort are all noticably 
improved. No ""buyer's remorse"" here!"

I look for places to go. The 
performance of the V8 is great, but the 
handling of this car is even better! I 
have added a K&N Filter and Magnaflow 
exhaust and just love the sound."
lincoln,ls,2003,g.butler, 02/18/2003,second lincoln LS,4,"We really like the new LS we just 
bought,it is very fast and handles 
extremly well.The interior could be a 
little fancier but it is very 
acceptable.This one is much improved 
over the first one,although we didn't 
have any problems after the first month 
on that one[a 2000 Ls sport V6].The new 
one is an LS V8 sport 2003."

well organized. Front seats are 
supportive, have plenty of adjustment.

& logical. Controls are easily 
accessible. Interior storage is 
good. Radio has great sound, 6 speakers

performance. Acceleration and handling 
are both excellent. This adds up to a 
very safe high performing car. If you 
drive freeway this car allows you to get 
on and through spaces in traffic without 
any effort. The car tracks very stable 
and predictably at all speeds through 
varying tightness and undulating turns. 
The interior is clean and logically laid 
out, good rear seat room nice view with 
theater seating, very good stereo and 
easy to use NAV system. 7000 miles and 
no issues. Dealer has performed oil 
change no charge, the 3 year 36000 mi

the car so much, I ordered a 2003 model 
as soon as they were introduced. The LS 
does everything well. From outstanding 
acceleration to responsive handling, 
this car exudes poise and class. I 
should also mention that I bought a new

It a dream to drive. You do not hear a

I've only had it about a week, so I may 
not be qualified to rate it on

lincoln,ls,2003,Kirk, 07/23/2003,Works for both short wife & tall husband,4,"We've had the car for a couple months 
now and its so much fun to drive.  Our 
son drives a 97 Mustang GT manual and 
this LS could probably beat it in every 
driving category.  The LS has ""balance"" 
that the GT just doesn't have.  The 
real-wheel drive together with 
independent rear suspension really make 
a difference.  Under ""severe"" 
conditions I always feel confident in 
the LS; where in the GT there are many 
times that I have to ""back-off"".  
Lincoln has done a good job in making 
the suspension, brakes, & wheels very 
light so that the car absorbs these 
bumps without transferring the force 
into the steering wheel or drivers seat."
lincoln,ls,2003,techman, 08/13/2003,Outstanding performance,4,"The LS is billed as a combination of 
luxury and performance and delivers 
both, especially performance. The V-8 
is smooth and has plenty of power and  
torque, but the most impressive thing 
about the car is the handling. It's 
responsive, goes where you point it  
and corners like it's on rails -- a 
real thrill to drive! I considered 
earlier models, but the refinements in 
the 2003 model sold me. Lincoln 
obviously listened to owners. I have no 
regrets so far and would recommend the 
car. Test drive one and find yourself 
some curves! "

The perfect 50/50 front to rear balance almost makes you forget this is a rear wheel drive car, until you Shift to sport mode, and it becomes a GT Mustang! While rear leg room can get cramped, driver comfort is excellent.  The heated and cooled front seats are nice. One of the best riding cars I have ever owned, and beats out the 5 series BMW I sold to get it.  "

you know what. Paid $30K for it and I
can't even get $9K for trade in. 
Please, please, don't make the same
mistake as I did.  No resale value at
all.  Brakes have been replaced at least
4 times and now it feels like the

replaced three times due to cracks. 
NEVER AGAIN!!"

best car I've ever driven. I traded my 
2000 LS and cannot believe what I got. 
In every aspect this car excels. Don't 
be fooled by the low cost (arount 
48,000) as compared to many similarly 
equiped luxury cars. It doesn't look 
cheap, drive cheap or handle cheap! 
Try one, I'm sure you'll agree!"
lincoln,ls,2003,selvarajah, 12/22/2005,good stuff,4,my wife was looking to buy a slightly used BMW 740. We test drove the vehicle and found the LS to have more agility and extremely comfortable. The 740 with its sluggish performance and overly abundant seating was not practical for the extra 20K more for a USED Vehicle.  Not to mention the horror stories one hears of with the electronics with German engineered cars.
lincoln,ls,2003,deeman, 01/28/2004,I have doubts and issues,3,"Upon delivery headliner started to fall 
down in the rear and sunglass holder in 
roof fell down.  Upon arriving home 
back doors would not unlock, had to 
crawl over front seats to exit auto.  
There are muffled noises coming from 
the passenger side dash and we have 
been told it may be caused by temp 
change, but they cannot find anything. 
Paid a premium price for what I thought 
was a luxury car but it hasn't lived up 
to the mark yet--I have my doubts that 
it ever will."

and get tons of comments on the car-all 
positive.  I love driving the car and 
it handles well; except it is missing 
front wheel drive and unfortunately I 
purchased the car on a winter that we 
received 12 plus inches of snow in one 
day and it does not handle well at all 
compared to the Taurus that I had in 
snow.  It actually did well up to 6 
inches of snow tho. The car runs so

Sports Model. What a find! This car 
compares very well with either in terms 
of performance, styling and surpasses 
them in comfort and value.  Nimble, 
lots of power, and all the conveniences 
only an American luxury car can 
deliver. This car is a winner. Seats 
four comfortably, big trunk, THX sound

lincoln,ls,2003,andy1102, 06/08/2004,The most underrated car in its segment,4,"I went with the LS V6 for price 
reasons, and my only dissapointment is 
that I couldn't get the 17"" rims with 
the 6-cylinder.
I've driven previous models with the V6 
and the improvements for 2003 are very 
evident.  The throttle actuation is 
smooth and the power is sometimes 
surprising when accelerating from a 
stoplight.  The engine gets a bit loud 
at higher RPMs, but is always smooth.
The ride can feel a bit soft sometimes, 
but, never floaty, it always feels 
connected to the road.  The suspension 
is well-damped and does a great job at 
dealing with bumps and imperfections.
While it's not a hard-core sports 
sedan, it always stays planted in the 
curves."
lincoln,ls,2003,leemann, 08/05/2004,This car is awsome!,4,"I love this car, even with a v-6 it

everyone at work wants to take a ride 
in it. the only problens I have had are 
the transmission kicking really hard

nice all around car to own."

lincoln,ls,2003,C. Murias, 08/24/2005,Noise and Brake Hell,3,"Since I bought the car I had to have the front brake pads replaced, transmission fixed, back window fixed and recently the front hub barring, with only 35K miles. Before I had the brakes replaced they squealed and after the brakes were replaced they squealed and continue to squeal. My brake pedal itself makes a rubbery squeaky noise, which the dealer has told me there is nothing wrong. After taking it in about 5 times, they tell me that this is a common problem and known defect and there is nothing they can do about it. I would not recommend this car, especially if you do not want to have a car in the shop all the time. It is nice to have maintenance free car, but come on."

better (and faster), and the seats are 
much more supportive than those in my

premium sport with navigation is such a 
better value. I shopped BMWs

The as-received build quality was 
excellent. It is very quiet and solid -
no rattles or squeaks.
  
The V8 is strong, responsive and 
quiet. It has excellent power 
throughout the entire rev range. 

Handling is superb. The Advance Track 
system won't let you lose control, 
especially in rain and snow. Near 
50/50 weight distribution. Anti-dive

Not because the dealer is far away, I 
just couldn't stop driving it! Much 
more fun and much better built than my

I don't know why this car receives such

It Rides like a Lincoln and Handles like
a BMW.

There are still a few points that remind

but feel our LS is a step up even 
though it is a bit smaller.
Cannot tell any differance from the v-8 
to a v-6 in driving performance"
lincoln,ls,2003,cdphillips, 06/17/2003,The American Import,5,"This car has it all. Styling, 
performance, etc. The new 280 HP V8 is 
great. The Advance Trac has been 
improved. The heated & cooled seats 
have been very useful so far. 
Adjustable pedals add to an already 
great interior. The cabin is so 
unbelievably quiet. The ride is smooth 
and yet responsive. Gas mileage has 
been improved. I could go on and on but 
I'm sure you get the picture."

lincoln,ls,2003,Londine, 07/05/2003,"Superb blend of ride, handling, luxury",5,"Smooth shifting tranny, ample torque let you 
slot into any hole in traffic -- easily.

Slick NAV. VERY easy, nice birds-eye view 
split-screen, voice prompts and voice 
commands. Impressive sound system. 

Quiet cabin. High winds dont affect the car 
at all, at any speed. Excellent steering feel. 
You sense the road texture, but no 
harshness or vibration gets thru. 
Fingertip-light at parking lot speeds (a big 
thing for my wife, who has arthritis), but 
nicely firmer at speed.

Seating position very comfortable. I'm 6', but 
had plenty of headroom, even with the 
moonroof, and with the seat adjusted high. 

Clean, elegant lines will age well."
lincoln,ls,2003,Road Angel, 05/07/2008,Wouldn't Trade For Nothing,4,"This is my dream car. The ride is smooth, the performance beyond expectation, the feeling of grandeur as you weave in and out of traffic. The sound quality, the look of the vehicle itself also tend to relax the mood when driving under stressful conditions. This baby has definitely become mama's new toy."

Moon roof! oh yea, did I mention how fast it is? mine already had tinted windows, rain vents, when I got it, satin pearl white paint is beautiful! It had 70,000 miles on it when I bought it, 9yrs old, and looks and runs like brand new, my friends cant are still asking me, what year is your car again?"
lincoln,ls,2004,cascadecolibri, 05/05/2013,Perfect Sedan for 2 Years Now!,4,"We bought this car used in 2011 while I was expecting our first child. I would not settle for a vehicle if safety was in question. The comfort and space were perfect for my back and belly! The driver side easy-exit seat was awesome! I felt safe riding home from the hospital with my new born daughter. In the time since we purchased it we have only had to do basic maintenance- oil changes, transmission fluid & air filter etc. Coming up on needing new tires. Apart from that I have had No Issues and it has been a blessing. 
Wish it handled better though. When my daughter is not with me I'd like a more exciting drive, but it might be best that it doesn't handle like a sports car..."
lincoln,ls,2004,Tim R., 07/12/2008,You'll Love This Car!,4,"Purchased a used (18,000 mi.) 2004 V8 with the LSE package in Oct. 2006. Had absolutely no problems so far (42k mi.) Very well ""built"" luxury sports sedan. Handles great--plenty of power--decent mileage* for a V8 with this power. Highly recommend this car because of value, quality and performance.  If your seeking a nice used luxury sports sedan at an ""affordable"" price, then this car should be on your ""list"".  The car runs fine on 89 octane (mid) gasoline, although 91 octane suggested by factory."
lincoln,ls,2004,Percy Mack, 11/26/2009,Sport Sedan Upgrade,4,"My used 2001 LS sold me on this model, so I purchased a 2004 LS in the summer of 2004. I was pleased then and am still pleased after 95000K. The handling is what sold me on this model Lincoln. On long trips using the cruise control net me about 400+ miles per tank. City driving is not so good. Lincoln need to bring this model back. Some factory warranties were still in effect after my regular warranty had expired. When the service department told me that it would be no cost, I was quite pleased. I have had no major problems and hope to drive this one until another one appear in the show windows."

After I got home noticed right front door slight different color shade than rest of car. Round and round with lying dealer, had to pay for repaint. Lincoln is the worst of dealers. In 4 times for door rattle, and never fixed. Door window failures, door lock replaced. Replaced 7 of 8 ignition coils, one at a time each visit, Lincoln would not fix all at once.  Getting ready to trade it in with 97k, it has been a good friend.  WILL NEVER BUY LINCOLN AGAIN. Looking at my FIRST import ever owned at age 62, Accura TL, can't fight the US made fight any longer, I surrender."
lincoln,ls,2004,Travis Bruce, 10/29/2007,One of the best to come,4,This car is just so pleasing and is very capable. So powerful and fast for its time and still is with some of these other car. When i purchased this car I felt like i had something before its time.
lincoln,ls,2004,yungdogg06, 07/27/2011,My Lincoln LS,3,"This car is pretty nice. I bought it in 08 with 35,000mi. In 2010 I started having problems. Transmission went out. Somewhere around $2500 to fix. Shortly after I noticed small things were breaking. A/c vent breaking off, driver chair back broke off, traction control button fell off, eyeglass holder wont stay latched, side rear view mirrors wont adjust, fuel buttons broke... And soon after the rear differential jacked up on me. Thats another $1500 that I payed out of my pocket. If thats not bad enough, just last week on a road trip.... My shifter cable popped off, wrapped around the drive shaft, ripped of trans cover, ripped off sensors
and more. Guess theyre not built to last."

lincoln,ls,2004,Eric Stevens, 11/13/2006,One of the best sedans owned,4,"We were looking at a explorer and saw the ls on the lot. My wife fell in love with its styling. After the test drive we were sold. For the money I feel you couldn't ask for a nicer sport sedan. It has always turned heads with it's looks and acceleration. Fuel mileage is what I expected for a car this size and weight. It's heavy but handling is great. Why does Ford always change what works for them? We've put almost 40,000 on it and the extended warranty would be worth it. Had an issue with the steering column squeaking, and the back panel of the front seat falling off. Both covered no problem under warranty, but I had non- critical issues with all new cars I've purchased. Bring it back. "
lincoln,ls,2004,Pete, 07/01/2008,Awesome LS but...,4,"'04 LS is just awesome to drive and look at and want to be in all the time but, fuel mileage is terrible in city and transmission. Has been in dealer shop twice now and is going back again due to jerky shifts, bucking uphills even after replacing trans solenoids."
lincoln,ls,2004,disappointed, 11/06/2008,Half a loaf,3,"I have always owned Fords. Generally like 'em. Stepped up with this one and what a disappointment.  Lincoln forgot to pay attention to detail. The transmission takes weeks to downshift so the V-8 power is squandered. The ""automatic rain sensitive"" wipers are a constant irritant. Throttle tip-in acts more like a 4-cylinder turbo than a V8. The dumb ""all windows down and sunroof open"" feature activates if the button on the fob is accidentally pushed so the car filled with rain one night. In general, a great potential that has been wrecked by lack of attention to detail. Should have gotten an Impala and saved the money."
lincoln,ls,2004,Rob, 03/13/2009,Upgraded to the LS,4,"Had a new Lincoln Zephyr and feel that I have upgraded to an older LS V8, better handling, performance, and overall comfort. at 1/3 the price for a used LS. "
lincoln,ls,2004,themacguy, 09/12/2009,a worthy successor to the old mark serie,4,"Purchased this one for about $12k off list at end of model year. Used 90% local and 10% highway driving, so the miles are only around 10k per year or so. Very good value for the money, even taking into account the depreciation factor since we got it so  cheap. Black with a light camel interior shows no wear even after 5 years in the. W. Tx. Sun, and that's saying something since it's never spent a day under cover. Lincoln should have taken the rear doors out and kept this as a 2 door 'mark.' big mistake as the fwd that replaced it is just a corporate car... My family's had lincolns since the 60's, but Lincoln is clearly in trouble now. Very sad. "
lincoln,ls,2004,nick p, 11/13/2009,LS V8,4,"I love this car, but it has some problems. The car is very jumpy and has very bad MPG. My transmission went out around 92000 miles my catalytic converter is messing up, the 6 disk cd changer has disk error every time i try to change cd's.

Having a black dash is pretty but not
a a smart thing.

Very nimble too, handles like a premium German automobile (Mercedes M-Class, BMW 5- series).  Too bad this car is going the way of the dinosaurs in a couple of years (after the '06 model year I believe).

I'm trying to bring the average age of 
Lincoln owners down.  The LS is a nice 
balance between the Lexus ES330 (ride 
too floaty, styling too bland) and the 
Acura TL (ride too choppy, styling 
trying too hard).  The ride is firm 
but comfortable; the car corners like 
it's on rails.  Styling is not 
exciting, but it should age well; 
given the performance it's kind of 
stealth-like.  Fit and finish are 
great, tho some materials and 
switchgear likely aren't up to 
Lexus/Acura standards.  Size is about 
perfect for city maneuvering.  The 6 
cyl. offers better acceleration than 
my Volvo's 5 and I have to be careful 
not to get going too fast on the 
Interstate.    "
lincoln,ls,2004,jerrym3, 12/10/2004,Lincoln's little known wonder,4,"I have a 2003 TBird, and the LS is my 
wife's car. Except for the TBird being 
an attention getter/convertible, I'd 
rather drive the LS. Since they share 
engines/trans, straight line 
acceleration is the same, but once you 
start hitting road bumps and taking 
sharp turns, the LS is the easy winner.
Anyone looking for a Sports Sedan that 
doesn't give this car a shot is being 
foolish.

With the folding seats, plenty of trunk 
space (got three 17"" wheels/tires in 
the car). Seats are comfortable, fit 
finish are great (ash tray is out of 
line, but I'll get that fixed by the 
dealer).

Because of the TBird, I wasn't shocked 
by the way this car accelerates, but 
you may be.

Styling will never get old."

My ""LS Ultimate"" is very quiet on the road and yet, you always feel secure and comfortable. Controls are convenient and easy to reach.

The engine stalled out on me and would only run on a few cylinders at 80 miles (yes 80).  It is now in the shop for the third time for a rear main engine seal that they can't seem to fix (over three weeks in the shop now).  The Electronics keep going out (navigation, stereo front power windows and moon roof) all at the same time. They stop functioning for days at a time and then start working again.  The dealer has not been able to isolate this problem.  The dealer is beside themselves on all of these issues."

Handles exceptionally well although the performance of the V6 is just average. Average mileage in LA traffic is 20-22.  Great navigation system - easy to program and use.  Unbelievably good THX sound system.  Heated and cooled seats are great but I don't really use them that much.  Great road-trip car, extremely comfortable and silent, plus nearly 30 MPG highway (actual).  Design is my only complaint - dated but still very clean.  Only recommendation would be if you can afford the gas (runs premium) I'd pick up the V8/sport package for performance boost."

The ride is firm (depending on the tires) and solid.  It's big but doesn't feel big on the road. Exceptional ride on the highway - city driving is unremarkable.  In the 3 months I have owned it, we have been in the shop 3 times - transmission, engine knock and noises from the steering column were the causes.  You hear too many noises for a car that costs this much. I know I didn't pay sticker, but that's probally the reason the LS is going out of production - it's way overpriced.  I got mine for less than half of sticker after only 18 months of use. "

I was surprised how stiff suspension was in the LS. Feels more like new Mustang GT than any Lincoln. Ride much firmer than BMW.  Steering is very tight.  I'd prefer a slightly softer ride and a little less impact over bumps.   LS is very quick, engine smooth and shifts are firm, but occasionally transmission seems to get confused.  Seats are fairly comfortable, not too soft or firm.  Interior quality is OK except dash looks a little rubbery.  For the price, a used LS is a great car.  While not quite on par with a BMW it looks good and provides great performance.   "

The LS is glued to the road.  It felt secure on turns even high speed ones.  I purchased the V6 so the pickup wasn't great, but it was respectable for a V6.  I got it in Silver with Grey Leather.  The wood trim really made the interior.  I upgraded to larger wheels, which gave the exterior a sporty look.  As far as maintenance, it was never a problem.

The engine is strong and I like the SST transmission. Seats are very comfortable even on long trips. The Instruments panel is dated in my opinion and I cant read the speedo to easy from my seating position. These are just minor grips.

The front seats, especially the drivers seat, needs to go back a tad further.  I am 5'-10"" and with my foot on the pedal, my knee is slightly bent - it shouldn't be.

It's not great in Winter conditions (It's rear wheel drive, what do you expect), gas mileage is on par around 20-21 mpg, good power, very comfortable, and is overall a good looking car.
I've read up on these cars for a few years trying to learn about its problems, its Pros and Cons, and decided its worth the money if you take care of it just like any other car.
My only gripe is you SHOULD feed it premium.
I don't care what websites say that you can run 87 in it...In the end, it will just slow ly kill it.

If you buy one used, check with ford. They have replaced all of them.

IF the car has over 75K, I recommend cooling tank and plastic pipe-like hoses be replaced and whatever else the service technician may recommend.

As soon at the warrenty was at 50k the nightmare began! rear control arm went rims need to be replaced,air conditioning broke,colling system went, 3 wheel bearings,more cracks in the cooling system,7 coil packs, power window broke, electric parking brake switch went,advanced track needed service , leaking rear differential,driver seat moter, and now the power steering is acting up. all dealer repairs coasting over $6K .This really is the car from hell! DONT BUY!!!!!!"
lincoln,ls,2005,hughege, 04/29/2008,Oil LeakI,4,"I took my LS to dealership regarding an oil leak problem on driveway at my home. I have 44500 miles now and still covered  by warranty. The service advisor determined a recall item (hose) need replacement. Before driving off the lot, I saw a oil leak again. returned to service advisor pointing it out. He described it as a run off,after other fluids levels had been topped. I was not convinced  and told him. He said drive it a few days if oil continues to leak to dealership. One week later oil puddle still on my driveway. "

I love this car, it is still perfect on the highway, no sounds whatsoever inside.  Has powerful pickup when needed and still has a beautiful exterior line.  I love it.

lincoln,ls,2005,michaelait, 03/23/2009,"Great buy, nice car",4,"I purchased this LS more or less blind.  I went to the dealership looking at Fusions.  The salesman showed this to me.  I drove it and was impressed.  A doctor had owned it, it is loaded, he left it very clean.  I love the power of the v8 and the rear drive.  The tranny is very smooth as is the acceleration. Seats, although flat, are comfortable. They are heated and cooled which is nice. The handling is exceptional, it has a very tight turning radius.  It cruises very well at 85 and 90.  I averaged 25.5 miles on a trip to Texas, which I thought was darned good for a v8.  I have two complaints: the AM radio reception is weak, and I do experience some valve chatter during hard acceleration."
lincoln,ls,2005,sheri, 09/03/2008,Excellent car for anyone,5,"I bought this car new and have no problems whatsoever. It handles nice, very comfortable on long trips and even my 30 yr old daughter loves driving it. very nice interior, roomy trunk, and it has enough power for all driving speeds. It is even good on fuel economy. Stereo speakers very good quality. I have driven this car back and forth from California to Texas and back on a few occassions and the car has given me a most pleasurable trips. It handles very well for a midsize car. I feel that anyone who drives this car will enjoy the experience, the ride, comfort and all the little extras, I have. I have had nothing but compliments on my car."
lincoln,ls,2005,Richard Blaine, 09/18/2016,Lincoln LS Quick and Fun,4,"I have enjoyed the LS for it's power and ride.  Very nice personal car.  A bit tight in the back seat.  Only problems were missing ignition which was remedied with new COP a few years back - none since then.  Then there is the Ford/Lincoln A/C system.  This dual temp system seems to have had a lot of problems.  Controls have messed up a couple of times on this car and our Town Car.  Also, lost the A/C compressor a couple of times over the 100,000 miles I've owned it.  Then the cd changer crapped out.  I have a couple of cds stuck in there.  Sound system is great except for that.  Overall, a very enjoyable, fast, safe car.
Mar 2017 - Have 130000 and still runs great.  See a lot of cars with lights out (I think indication of poor quality) and this car all lights work.  So do all electronics, except for the jammed cd player.  Still quick and still solid.  Even get a few 'nice car' from folks who see it.  Good styling considering some of the awful choices Lexus and Audi have made.  A/C is ok now, but controls sometimes get crossed signals for temp.  I hope Ford has finally figured this dual system out.
"
lincoln,ls,2005,Joe, 07/07/2006,Most Unreliable Car I ever Owned,2,"I regret the purchase.  Lincoln does not stand for quality or luxury.  It's just a Ford with a different emblem.  It's eaten two batteries in less than 9 months. Ford & the dealer are not standing behind this flawed product.  The thing is assembled in Mexico where Ford has quality control issues.  The interior finishings are sub-par for a ""luxury"" car, but fine if it was Ford branded. The touted 1 year maintenance plan is actually a downgrade from a 3 year plan that use to be inclusive.  The only good thing about the car is the smooth ride.  But that is because it has a Jaguar suspension.  But it also has Jaguar electrical systems which are chronically flawed, hence its taste for batteries."
lincoln,ls,2005,lisa, 09/12/2009,can't wait to trade it in,3,"The Lincoln LS looks very impressive. It gets a lot of attention and needs alot of attention. It has been nothing but a money pit ever since I bought it. Within one week I had two coils repaired( very expensive). From little things to more expensive stuff, it's something every week. I recently stopped by an auto parts store (again) for help with the broken screws on the traction button that had broke. The men committed how the car looked nice. I replied, ""want to buy it?"" They laughed and said ""NO WAY! Those are nothing but lemons!"" Wish I had heard that before I made the mistake of buying it.      "
lincoln,ls,2005,Bilbo, 07/29/2010,4 wheel perfection,5,"Amazingly smooth, faster than the CTS I drove, better materials than the Mercedes 430S, better road tests/handling than a 540i and a LOT more reliable than my neighbors Lexus. (ZERO repairs in 100K miles and just did my first tune up and sealed coolant change as designed) AND for $36K off the lot! What an amazing car! (At track days we hit 139 mph on the 17 inch Michelins - do not tell me insurance agent plz!) and other than adding an upgraded ceramic brake pad the car performs like the Jaguar S type (engine/trans and chassis/brakes are the same) but is a sleeper in subtle but classy style. Beat Lexus for JD Powers delivery awards in 2005. PLEASE keep building them like this!"
lincoln,ls,2005,Nirvana, 07/22/2005,Typical Car -- Audi A6 better!,4,"The Lincoln LS is for the basic transportation, not luxurious as a Cadillac CTS or Audi A6. I had this car for a for a year, and gave me alot of problems. First off it rattled a lot, poor mileage, weak performance. Seats started to rip and tear off, typical Lincoln, you know? Very unreliable, if you think this car is cool, I dare you to test drive a 2005 Audi A6 3.2 Quattro and tell me you didn't enjoy it. I personally wouldn't recommend it, It's your money. Keep on reading.  "

The front end is rattling again after it had front struts, sway bar links, and tie rod ends installed at 145,000 Kms.
The E-brake light is on and beeping.
I don't use it so I don't understand why it would need service.
The traction control switch fell through the hole in the console for no apparent reason.
I had to replace the power steering pump because it was leaking badly.
The oil pan is leaking again, at least I think it's the oil pan.
The coil packs (5th set) are due to be changed again because the car stutters at times and that lets me know the coil packs will need changing soon. FORD - you suck!!!"
lincoln,ls,2005,Chris C., 10/07/2008,Love My LS,4,"We were looking for a Mustang, but deciding it was not right for our family, we found our 2005 LS sitting on the lot. It was owned by a Ford executive and was originally registered to Ford. The car has all the power I could want with the comfort my wife loves. We got a great deal on the car with full warranty. After owning foreign cars for the past several years, I am really hooked on the good old American cars again. If I were to buy a new car, it would most likely be the LS replacement, the Lincoln MKS. Only major problem with the car is the reverse warning stopped working. Took it to dealer and the sensor unit was replaced under warranty and in 1 day."
lincoln,ls,2005,Doris, 09/14/2009,My 2005 Lincoln LS (Sport) V-8,5,"I have owned this car just a little over 4 years, and have had no problems with it.  It had 21,000 miles on it when I purchased it.  I am religious about maintenance on my vehicles, and that's all I've had to do.  Nothing replaced, everything is still working well at 81,000 miles.  I love the way it handles, rides, and the excellent acceleration!  Good enough on gas for me (20 around town; 25-26 or so highway).  Since it is beautifully styled, you feel beautiful driving it.  It turns heads!  If Lincoln ever re- introduces it, I will definitely rebuy."
lincoln,ls,2005,Rocky, 09/11/2005,Never AGAIN!!!!,2,"Big disappointment. 2 major transmission failures in 17,000 miles. Power rear windows work when they want to. Horrible gas mileage. "

They are too hard since they are so close to the console.The transmission seems to jerk sometime while changing. I have advised the dealersip of this twice and they cannot find any reason it would do this and while test driving , it does not do it. The time and temp. are hard to read in the daytime."

I sold it last summer only because my family was growing and i needed room for more car seats. For having a small v8 it got great gas mileage. Ave 21 on the highway at 75-80 mph. I actually shed a few tears watching the new owner drive it out of my driveway and disappear at the end of the street. Only problem which is very notorious with the 3.9l v8 is coil packs going bad. I found replacements on eBay and amazon for next to nothing. Like 50 bucks shipped for all 8. They’re fairly simple ti change. I miss mine every day!

I just purchased my used 2005LS V8 with 60K mile on it and feel safer now then ever before. regardless of airbags, this is a very safe car. so I do agree with ""Stacy M"" ""have airbags checked"" and Lincoln please bring the LS back. Patrick..."
lincoln,ls,2005,JR, 06/18/2010,disappointed,2,"I still like the look of this car and it is fun to drive when it works. Seem to have constant problems with it and nothing is ever inexpensive to fix. Just spent over three weeks going between a mechanic and Ford trying to figure out what was wrong (it would miss while idling). We think it is finally fixed after replacing all the boots and coils. I am not trusting that we won't have more problems soon. Our regular mechanic won't touch it. We tried to sell it and no one wants it even though the interior and exterior is in excellent condition. I thought I was getting a high end, high quality car. I have owned several Fords before. I am now questioning if I want to every buy another Ford."
lincoln,ls,2005,direct, 03/14/2006,Excellent,4,"This is my 2nd LS, the first being a 2000.  In 5 years, the LS has improved with an even smoother ride, satellite navigation system, heated and cooled front seats and other luxury amenities too numerous to mention.  The LS is not only fun to drive as it handles like a sports car, but also very reliable."
lincoln,ls,2005,Doug, 12/11/2008,Lincoln LS Luxury with attitude,4,"Prior to buying this vehicle the only concern I had was fuel economy. Turns out this car  does well on long trips. Just did a drive from British Columbia to Yuma return. On the average I got approx. 26 MPG. If you use the power you pay the price.  Hold it under 70 MPH and you'll be happy. I bought this vehicle as a lease return I cannot find anything wrong with the car,  however I took it in for some minor repairs and was pleased with my treatment from Ford. I have owned about 15 new Fords over the past 30 years. I am not the least disappointed in this car.  It is a treat to drive & gets lots of compliments. Handles well in snow."
lincoln,ls,2005,Jiggs, 02/24/2009,Sports Sedan,4,"What a great sedan! It's good looking, well built, handles like a BMW and is surprisingly affordable. Why Lincoln didn't just continue to improve and fine tune it instead of stopping production in 2006 is beyond me.  "
lincoln,ls,2005,Marjan, 03/12/2009,Good Stuff,5,"Purchased with 13K on it, coming off lease.  Great price as these cars don't hold their value.  Great value if you plan on driving it for 10 years like I do.  Bang for the buck, much better than comparable BMW, Acura, Lexus and Mercedes products.  I'm very happy with this product so far.  "
lincoln,ls,2005,Steve Timm, 02/17/2005,Best car I have owned,5,"Everything about this car shouts performance and quality. It is everything a BMW or Mercedes is, but better because it is AMERICAN! If there is anything I would change , I would give the back seats a little more leg space. At 6'3"" I have to move the driver seat forward to provide enough leg room for anyone older than 10. My knees almost touch the dash which is not comfortable for any lenght of time. Otherwise a great car."
lincoln,ls,2005,Faithfull one, 02/06/2005,The 05 is even better then 02,4,"This is my second Lincoln LS I loved my 02 but this one is even better. It has incredible power, handles wonderfully, and is so fun to drive. The even weight from rear to front keeps the car from nose diving when stopping fast. I was sold on it when we were doing 75 mph and the truck in front of us lost his load and we had to stop suddenly. We never lost control and stopped with such ease."
lincoln,ls,2005,Eddie B, 11/23/2006,Good sports car,4,"I purchased this 2005 LS used with 23000 miles on it.  So far it's been a fairly nice car to drive.  I was however, expecting a bit more from a Lincoln.  I'm 60 years old and basically have always owned a sports car......3 T-birds in a row......  I wanted to move up to a more comfortable riding vehicle.  The Lincoln doesn't ride as well as I would like it to.  It is the best handling car I've ever owned though and I've had a few Corvettes in my time.  All in all, for the price, it's been very good so far."

lincoln,ls,2005,4d4erv, 03/17/2005,Best I've owned,5,Just purchased.  Drove over 600 miles yesterday and got better that 23 mph. Good I think for not broken in.  I expect the 26 est. to be realistic with more miles on the car.  Lots of extras make driving experience enjoyable.  Love the leather and the seats offer lots of support on long drive.
lincoln,ls,2005,Jim G. Verges, 05/03/2005,Not Your Father's Lincoln!,4,"I have ridden in Lincoln's before; my father currently owns a 2004 Lincoln Town Car, and it is an excellent car which does what it is designed to do- transport its occupants in luxury with every conceivable convenience at your finger tips.  The vehicle is solid, well-built auto with a velvet-smooth ride.  The only draw back is that it does not exude the image of a performace sedan.  So when I had the opportunity to rent a Lincoln LS a few months ago, I was pleasantly surprised by a Lincoln that is not only luxurious, but also a pleasure to drive.  The acceleration is brisk, yet refined enough to not spill your passengers'champange. The build quality is excellent, and the design is very sexy."
lincoln,ls,2005,Jane & Wes Breschini, 04/24/2005,My Lincoln LS,5,"My experience with my Lincoln LS has been very satisfactory.  I had driven a GM Buick Park Avenue for 7 years and also had a good experience except, I wanted a smaller car but with the same amenities and quality as my Buick.  I love this car....it is smaller in size and I ride in great comfort.  I purchased it off the lot.......I had a list of what I wanted and there it was, color and everything with some extra features. I am 70 years old."
lincoln,ls,2005,Paul Roberts, 07/03/2005,L6 Fantastic Value,4,"I purchased a 2005 Lincoln LS w/ V6 in June.  Between the Dealer, Lincoln & Ford Financing, I was able to snag this gem for $23,000.  It's basic for a Lincoln with only special paint as an option.  Since its a Lincoln though basic is pretty cush.  The ride is great and there are tons of nice features that you won't find on an Accord, Camry and Passat. The fit and finsih are every bit as good as the best of the European and Japanese models. I'm delighted with my purchase!"
lincoln,ls,2005,Jay Blender, 06/19/2006,Enjoying A True Bargain American Origina,4,"Thje LS is my third Lincoln.  I began with the '92 Continental which was wonderful until I traded it for the '98 Town Car Touring Edition: the original Touring Edition in Red. What a terrific road car. I've never driven a 2 ton car that handled as confidentially at the '98 Touring Edition Town Car.  Reluctantly, I had to sell it when I moved. The LS apparently was engineered on the successes of the Touring Edition for it's tight, quiet and quite fast. It is safe and reflects well on American engineering. It gives about 80% of the performance of the BMW 540 for about twenty-thousand dollars less.  It's also roomier and far better styled. BMW wouldn't be my choice now."

When car flipped 3 to 4 times completely totalling out car the only airbag that deployed was passenger's side front. Car nose dived on driver's side flipping & hit every point on car but the steering wheel nor side airbags ever deployed. Lucky to be alive! If you own a Lincoln LS have airbags checked-end this accident I was informed all airbags should've deployed that would've help prevent alot of pain & stay in hospital."

It's a very sharp looking car that turns heads.  The base audio system puts out a good amount of power.  It gives a very comfortable drive in town and on long highway trips.  Car really hugs the road on winding and hilly roads.  Not up to par with the European industry leaders, but good for what it is."

Don't be deceived, after more research, Others have experienced the same problems. These are common problems with the Lincoln models, I don't understand why there have not been a recall?"

I plan to drive this car for a long time so the year model wasn't an issue for me.  My friends are all quite impressed.  One remarked that it was so quiet that it didn't sound like a car, it sounded more like a kitten purring.  So far, I'm getting 19 mpg city driving & I haven't tried it on highway driving yet."

My new Lincoln LS Sport drives like a Shelby Mustang, and shifts like a Ferrarri. The suspension truly gives it sports car road feel.  The instrument cluster is not cluttered and easy to view.  The leather wrapped steering wheel is nice to grasp and holds easy on the curve, noting that there is little sway on turns, especially at higher speeds.  By combining sport features with luxury, Ford has another great product in this little Lincoln."
lincoln,ls,2005,bonesofstone, 10/23/2004,Job Well Done,4,"Over time I have owned a number of 
luxury sedans and I am thoroughly 
impressed by the LS.  Lincoln has come 
a long way in its quest for a front 
line competitor with the European and 
Japanese makes in its class.  It is fun 
to drive as well as practical 
(selectshift transmission is great in 
traffic... less use on brakes). 
Handling is fantastic! One thing I'd 
like to see improved would be shoulder 
room and leg room for the front and 
back."

At first when I got into this car I felt a little awkward - it was smaller.  Oh But just a few test drives and it caught me, with the beauty, the go, the style and one thing that I have always like and that was rear wheel drive. When I was looking to purchase I had looked and test drove the Grand Marquis, Ford 500, Mercury Montego and the Buick LaCross - non made me feel as comfortable in it like this one did."
lincoln,ls,2005,Ivan, 03/22/2005,Lincoln LS: There is no substitute...,4,The Lincoln LS is the ultimate driving machine.  Affordability and extensive features makes this car attractive to any gadget man who likes toys (like the GPS) and the feeling of safety and power on the open road.
lincoln,ls,2005,Jeffrey D Bryant, 05/24/2005,LS - More fun than I thought,4,"My daily round trip commute is about 100 miles.  Accordingly, my main car, a 2004 Porsche 911, was not entirely practical for the commute - especially in stop and go traffic.  The LS appealed to me as a mid-size sedan with a V8 - that was affordable (OK - if I had not already sprung for the Porsche - a BMW V8 would be in the garage - but I do have a marriage to maintain).  It has delivered far more than expected 0 - 80 is fun - nice engine sound.  Handling is also much better than expected.  I was expecting a V8 Taurus with upscale trim so I am all around happier than I thought I would be.  I arrive at work comfortable and relaxed.  For the money, I do not think I could be more pleased."
lincoln,ls,2005,erik glaser, 10/04/2005,6-month checkup,4,"the handling is so good that the ride experience seems less exciting than say, the mustang; and it certainly would be nice to have a 5- or six-speed manual option; but take a glance down at the speedo. and realize that you're doing 95 when you swear it could only be 70- not shabby. negatives:1) the doors are CHEAP/LIGHT/CHATTERY 2)the Advanctrak, while it has probably saved my life, when disabled does NOT turn off the traction control at take-off, which leaves one at an initial disadvantage next to a... sports-car competitor; furthermore, the select- shift doesn't help with this  0-to- whatever limitation(it does, delightfully, help with manuevering around those ubiquitious left-lane Volvos).

lincoln,ls,2005,Socalteddy, 11/16/2005,Good ride,4,This is a good car for the money.  I enjoy the ride and overall comfort. My next car will be the BMW 525.  I will spend the extra money to get the higher level of quality found and performance in the BMW products.   The LS was purchased because of the price point and ride quality. 
lincoln,ls,2005,Todd, 11/29/2005,Best Sleeper in its Class,5,This car is amazing.  The perfomance and handling are a major surprise.  I am extremely pleased with the smooth ride and handling characteristics at highway speed.  
lincoln,ls,2005,Pasquale, 04/04/2006,I love my towncar,4,"I have owned 3 Lincoln Towncars since 1990 and I have loved them all.  The ride is as good as any and the value is great when you compare the price of a Linclon ($30,000) to a Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, etc... ($50,000-85,000).  OK you get the prestige and one-upmanship with those foreign nameplates but personally I would rather drive a Lincoln and pocket the difference in cash, but then I am just an average middleclass American."
lincoln,ls,2005,Brendan, 08/05/2007,Disappointing LS,4,"I purchased my 05 LS V6 used with 19000 miles on it with high hopes. I planned on keeping it for many years and was happy with the deal I got on it ($18795).  About 6 months after purchasing this vehicle I had to have the transmission serviced for a shifting problem. The following winter I had the car in service 3 times for various problems(burning oil smell which turned out to be silinoid rails, a cracked throttle body and a leaking transmission hose).  I owned the car for almost two years and am now forced to part with it because the warranty is almost gone and I was not smart enough to purchase an extended one up front(current cost $4100).  Be ready for a car with high maintenence.."

lincoln,ls,2005,Mildly Disappointed, 08/13/2007,Mildly Disappointed,3,"I've owned my LS for nearly two years, having ""stepped up"" from a Grand Marquis. For a car prices in the upper 30s, I'm not impressed. The front tires (Continentals) began severly cupping at 30,000 miles.  Lincoln would only stand by a 50% replacement with Michelens. Gas mileage is signficantly less than advertised. There is no backseat room when the driver's seat is fully back. Trunk space is very""shallow, will  accomodate only one large suitcase. On the plus side, the V6 does give plenty of power when passing, but sometimes lurches when backing up or starting forward. The front seat AC/Heat is a nice feature and overall the AC system cools well.  I expected more from a Lincoln."
lincoln,ls,2006,Mark, 03/04/2010,2006 Lincoln ls v8 sport - premium,4,"I just purchased a 2006 Lincoln ls v8 sport.  78k miles for $13,000.  First off I cannot believe that a car that went for $45,000 just 3 years ago was this cheap!  I just got out of an 06 GTO with 400 hp so I was a little skeptical of the 280 hp v8.  Premium interior, sound system, power moonroof, advancetrac, heated/cooled seats, are all excellent features.  Especially the surround sound .  Roomy, comfortable ride!  Throttle lags a bit especially in low gears, (compared to gto) very stiff sporty suspension handles nice and most other performance is as advertised. "
lincoln,ls,2006,gkhize, 01/26/2014,Excellent Car,5,"I put 150K on a 2001 LS without incident and then traded it for the 2006 with 5K.I have been very happy with this car in every single way and now have over 160K miles on it. The only issue I've had was replacing the thermostat. It's a bit of a challenge and the guy changing it (me) didn't get the housing tight the first time. No issues after that. Runs great, drives great, gets decent mpg and still looks good. I'd buy a new one tomorrow if they still made them. "
lincoln,ls,2006,Manny, 05/24/2010,American Muscle and Style,4,"Picked up a pre-owned 2006 with 32k on it. Love the ride, acceleration, and the interior.

lincoln,ls,2006,James Selix, 12/12/2015,Owned for 7 1/2 Years,5,"I have had little maintenance. Bought used from a dealer as a program car with 9K. Maintenance in 7.5 years includes: set of tires, new battery, front brake pads & turn rotors, new fan belt, oil / filter chg. every 3K, and keep it spotless. Great fun to drive and comfortable on long trips.

lincoln,ls,2006,Fatboy1904, 12/10/2006,"2006 Licoln LS, Great Buy !",4,"This car replaces my 2001 LS V8.  I love it. Can't believe I waited to trade up my other LS, as it had almost 108K on it. It is a true shame that Lincoln decided to discontinue this car. For the price, this car blows away 3&5 Series BMW, Lexus, Acura and all the others. Everyone who rides in this car can't believe it is a Lincoln and finds the complete luxury experience that you would expect from higher end vehicles. I bought the Elite Package with power everything, heated front & REAR seats, THX audio with Navigation, HID lights etc.  The engine is smooth and quiet, not to mention 280 hp is more than enough to get in trouble.  The car by far out handles most cars of this weight and class."
lincoln,ls,2006,LS lover, 04/10/2008,Lincoln LS,4,"The Lincoln LS is the absolute most fun vehicle I have owned. I love taking this car on long distance trips more than I do our Lexus GS430. The seats are the absolute most comfortable I have had the pleasure of sitting in. The styling is great, the interior is even better. This is the second LS I have owned. THe only downfall I see is repair costs when something needs to be replaced. Every part on this car seems to be more expensive than the average car...including oil changes. Nonetheless, I would buy a third LS!"
lincoln,ls,2006,GML, 08/04/2008,2006 Lincoln LS....Great Car!,3,"The 2006 LS is a great car that should not have been discontinued! The current MKZ lacks a V8 engine, and therefore, is not as fun to drive. My mother had an '02 LS and an 04' LS. The '06 is fun to drive and has great pick-up and power. The interior is comfortable and well-designed in my opinion. Like the Continental, which was also a great car, Lincoln no longer makes the car. However, if you're looking to buy a used car, then check out the LS!"
lincoln,ls,2006,Mike, 12/28/2005,2006 LS,4,"I had a 2000 and 2001 LS. With Lincoln's unwise demise of the LS, I decided we needed the last of the breed. As my (2000) LS has over 100K miles and the 2001 had only 60K, we traded in the 2001. We got Dark Cherry with black interior. This car is light years ahead of my 2000. Granted, mine has the V6 and the '06 is the V8, but acceleration is quick and plentiful! Fit and finish is second to none. The car is very tight. It handles better than my '00. The interior is as a Lincoln should be. With the tilt/tele steering wheel and adjustable pedals, it is easy to get the correct position. The NAV is easy to use, and the directions are easily followed. The THX system is outstanding! "
lincoln,ls,2006,mrjwk, 03/20/2006,As good as my 5 series,4,"I have only owned this car for 2 weeks, so I can't judge reliability yet.  However, after owning 2 BMW 5 series sedans, I can say that this car is their equal in terms of comfort and performance.  This may relate to my driving style, which is not real aggressive, so I appreciate that the suspension on the LS is tuned a little softer.  Car is a joy to drive, front seats are very comfortable, and reports from the back seat are that there is plenty of room.  The wood grain interior accents get lots of compliments.  Stereo sound is excellent (audiophile option).  Gas mileage is not great, but I knew that going in (still, in mixed driving, I am averaging 18 mpg).  I would recommend this car."
lincoln,ls,2006,Tim, 12/08/2006,LS Review,4,"The car is sweet on the highway, at 70 mph i can get 28 mpg, at 60 i get 29 mpg, at 45 i get 32 mpg. In the city i get 19-22 depending on stop lights and traffic. I wish the display showed instantaneous MPG readings, instead it just shows average. the radio plays CD's but not MP3's. Stereo Rocks, nice sound. The trunk does not always ""pop"" open when i hit the button, i have to lift it (really no big deal) Brakes squeak, i don't know if it would get better if i stuck different pads on it, i have not tried, but i asked about it. I should have gotten the GPS built in, but cash was an issue."
lincoln,ls,2006,Good Looking, 03/27/2008,Fits Me,4,"I have had my LS since April of 06.  Bought it brand spanking new.  I traded my Mercury Mountaineer for it because I wanted a car something sporty for a 40+ yr old female, good looking.  It growled at me at the dealership showroom.  The performance is excellent.  It will git up an go. The color, Silver/Platinum nice.  Now, the only problem I have is the rumbling noise in the dash.  Supposedly it is coming from air in the heater line?"
lincoln,ls,2006,Ian, 04/13/2008,Road car heaven,4,"This is the car I have been looking for. In a world of front wheel drive sedans the rear wheel LS is a breath of fresh air. I had the fortunate experience of driving my new LS back to back wih my brother in laws BMW 535 IX. The BMW was a little faster, a little quieter and a little more agile - but not by much. Certainly not enough to justify the huge price difference. The LS handles well and looks good. I had the pleasure of driving a 2003 V6 model on a solo road trip from Florida to Michigan a few years ago and never tired of getting back in after a long days drive. A great driver's car. My 2006 V8 is even better and I like it more each time I drive it.   "

Put it this way, check engine light was on so many times in the 6 years I owned I can't even recall how many times. Check charging alert - replaced the $200 alternator and $130 battery and STILL ON. This car is an ELECTRONIC NIGHTMARE - I wish I had got rid of this MONEY PIT before I found out my rear A-frame was rotted out beyond fixing, won't pass inspection and isn't safe. Oh and lets not forget it's 17"" tires get CHEWED through like nothing I have ever seen before- can't even find a decent tire with decent tread rating all below 500.

lincoln,ls,2006,Wendy Lee, 12/28/2017,STAY AWAY,2,"I almost bought a 2006 Lincoln Ls & took it to my Mechanic & he also ran a computer diagnostics on it too & he told us to walk away from these type cars. They will cost you loads of money to fix & it basically runs on a computer system like 6 if not more. So if anything goes wrong with this car your looking at lots of money to dish out & it will break your bank/ pocketbook. They are very nice cars, not worth the price and money in the long run, if this type car runs into any problems. The engine coil goes out in these cars quite often. That’s about $450 including labor for each coil & the front struts run on a computer system as well & cost around $450 each side to fix. Not worth it! Your better off with a Honda.

lincoln,ls,2006,fordblueblood1, 09/09/2013,Great car except for transmission shift points,4,"Bought a 2006 LS in Dec of 2011, It had 62K on it and I've put about 5K on it to date (9/2013). I like the car. I wanted to buy and American RWD sedan and there weren't many choices. We already own a V8 Charger and I wanted something different. It was a Pontiac G8 or this. G8 would not accommodate my 15 y.o. in the back seat. More cramped. I did have to replace the heater control valve near the radiator. It was blowing hot air from the A/C. A disappointment on a car with only 67K on it. I've had no other issues with the car. It runs well and has lots of power and handles very well. It has a nice firm ride. Fun around off ramps. Very nice THX stereo too. If it wasn't for the trans, I'd be 5's"
lincoln,ls,2006,Springunner, 08/20/2006,American Icon For Pennies,4,"$27,000 out the door with heated seats, sun roof and adj. pedals. Yes it looks like a Galant and a BMW at times. It is a steal and sure its not the greatest car on the road. However the Mercedes snobs best do a search on the Merc E350 and it is true that the Mercedes is the bomb when its not in the garage or on the side of the road. And who needs the $100 oil changes and the expense.  The Lincoln takes care of you for the first 12mo/12K miles on maintenance. Yes I would like to have had more features on the inside- slightly wider seats in the front, better basic radio with less controls and a better dash layout. Sure I'd like to have another 50 hp too. But Lincoln treats me like a star."
lincoln,ls,2006,Mr_Ken, 10/31/2006,My New Baby!,4,"I finally got the car I've wanted for 4 yrs! Traded in my Avalon, for a sporty and more comfortable car. I've tried BMWs (3,5,7) and the 3&5 were painful to sit in, the 7 was maybe equal but a few k more... The Lexus, Toyotas, Nissan, Acura, Honda, Infiniti never had the right mix and most had too much lumbar support that couldn't be backed off enough (my Avalon had front bench seat). I don't expect to get the high miles I've gotten with my Toyota, but I sure am going to have a lot more fun and comfort when trying to get there! I know I irritated lots of salemen with 30+ test drives, but I put on the miles and I don't want to sacrifice if I don't have too and I don't!"
lincoln,ls,2006,Steve G, 07/06/2006,First but not my last Lincoln,4,"I purchased my Lincoln LS just a few weeks ago and so far I'm very impressed.  The interior is not flashy, Ford calls it understated, and I appreciate the visual smoothness. Power and driving experience are exceptional and make the car fun to drive.  The interior is comfortable for a 6'1 driver, with plenty of seat and steering wheel adjustments. I'm getting tons of honest compliments on the car and as many requests to take it for a drive.  It's too new for me to comment on gas mileage but if I can get 20 MPG average with this smooth and fast V8, I'm more than happy. The Audiophile sound system is awesome as are the chrome 17 inch wheels.  The leather is stiff but I hope it softens with time."
lincoln,ls,2006,BurtonFamily, 07/30/2005,LS V8,4,"Sexy car!  It just doesn't like to go slow (or maybe that's just me when I'm driving it!)  Gas mileage stinks, but we didn't buy it with economy in mind.  It's not real roomy inside and the trunk space is lacking, so no long road trips for more than 2 people if you like comfort!  It looks great, it's fun to drive and it's good to know I'm driving an AMERICAN Luxury car. I feel proud pulling up to any of the competition."
lincoln,ls,2006,Wallzilla, 07/19/2006,Best Luxury Car for the Money,4,"Lincoln has always been one of the stronger US brands.  The LS is an amazing car.  I test drove the GS300 and the Infiniti M35.  When equally equipped, each car has a similar sticker price.  BUT, the most I could get off of a Lexus or an Infiniti was 3- 5%.  I was able to get almost 40% off a new LS.  The car is not worth it's sticker, but what car is?  When you factor in the discount, this is the best car for the money.  The resale hit is non-exsistent when you make the right deal.  Highly recommended.  "
lincoln,ls,2006,MSWheel, 04/14/2008,First LS,4,"This is my first luxury sedan. I've owned many sports cars and had trucks as my daily drivers. The latest sedan that I have owned is a 2006 Grand Prix, so my comparison will be based on that car. The LS is a very fun car and as it is used, it only has 4500 miles on it.  The power level from the small V8 pushing 4K pounds is very substantial and smooth. The ride quality is very good and allows quick response during any situation and speed. As far as the interior goes I will have to agree that there should have been more effort from the designers in allowing more/better adjustments for the drivers seat, it just seems a little flat compared to the other vehicles I have had, inc the trucks."
lincoln,ls,2006,W, 09/24/2006,Lincoln Quality Not!,3,"Headlights kept filling with water when it rained, the rear windows failed open on a ski trip, the light in the stereo last about a week.  They replaced the headlights three times with headlights that filled with water, told me I didn't know how to operate the stereo four times until they finally replaced the whole unit.  Repair the windows twice.  Then the plastic imitation chrome started flaking off the interior panels and the sun roofed leaked.  The car started to idle like a D-10 CAT in a coal mine.  Called in quits after a year and a whopping 8,000 miles, lemon lawed it and gave it a new home in the dealers junk yard.  That was the same year Ford was ""At Ford, quality is job one"".  "
lincoln,ls,2006,golfnut, 07/10/2006,American luxury at its best,5,"Traded in my 02 LS for the 06 LS.  What a shame that Lincoln has decided to table this car - it is simply fantastic.  Compared this car to the BMW 5 series.  The Lincoln has as many, if not more luxury features at a fraction of the price.  Handles smoothly and has great looks.  It is a real head turner.  Lincoln finally corrected the lack of interior space and added 17 inch wheels.  The gas mileage is not great, but it is not terrible either.  It is comparable to other cars in this class.  The LS is a blast to drive and it will not break the budget.  My out the door price before the trade was $33,268. "
lincoln,ls,2006,D Waters, 06/26/2006,Lincoln LS: Disappointment,2,"When we first got the car, I was somewhat (not very) excited, but now I'm just disappointed. There are several pros and cons. PRO: The seats are pretty comfortable in the front. CON: In the rear seats, I noticed that this strange mix of dust and dirt blows in when you open the vents. PRO: At times, when you're slowly inching along (around 30 mph), you can get 40 mpg( the average is 16 mpg). CON: the radio is awful. PRO: So far, this car seems to be quite reliable. CON: The rear seats are very uncomfortable. CON: It was way overpriced for what it's worth. (another)CON: This car just can't seem to stay in competition with foreign automakers. We're soon going to switch to a Mercedes S65 AMG."

I liked the way my '02 handled - this handles better!  In addition, this car is a headturner.  You cannot go anywhere without somebody doing a double take as you go by!!!  Obviously, I did not buy this car for gas mileage, but it is pretty competitive with other cars in its class.  I did compare this a BMW 325xi and the Lincoln has more luxury features at a much better price.  My out the door price was $35,427.  I wish Lincoln would have continued to make this underrated gem.

It's overpriced, there are more features on a M-Benz C230 Sport Sedan than on this vehicle. Not so impressed with leather. Pretty nice handling. I've also noticed that D Waters is right! My LS Doesn't only blow dust in from the back rows, but from the front rows as well. It might attract more business if it's  called a V6, cause no one really wants a very weak V8, they want a Powerful V6. Luxury options are too pricy, and I might say the exterior is, well, ugly. However, the Interior is pretty nice. On an overall, I would recommend a BMW 330i or a MB C280 or Audi A4. "

lincoln,ls,2006,Happy in Ohio, 08/28/2006,Excellent Value,4,"My last two cars were Jags (XJ and S- Type). I thought the LS was a poor copy of the S-type, but huge rebates lured me to take a test drive . I was shocked. The 2006 LS corners and handles better than my S-Type with less wind and engine noise.  The 3.9 V8 has a sportier feel than my Jag's 4.0. The interior is less ""euro,"" but still clean and luxurious, with a few nice touches my Jags didn't have.  When I learned I'd get an extended 6-year drivetrain warranty AND $14,000 reduction off the $43K sticker ($29,000 !!!), it was -- ""duh""-- impossible to pass on such an excellent value! If you can live without a European nameplate, buy this car while they last and bank your money."

We were so impressed with it that when looking to refresh our car this year, we considered only the LS. We decided to purchase new because the Ford Family pricing (in Canada) and other incentives brought the price in line with what we wanted to spend.  I love this car. However, I don't love everything about it. The rear seat leg room is poor. The fuel economy is merely acceptable, but the Premium (91+) requirement means spending even more on gas.  The interior is beautiful, with real wood trim and premium leather. Power adjustable everything with memory is great with two drivers."

lincoln,ls,2006,chris culotta, 07/22/2007,"""Close """,4,"This is my second LS.  I bought a 2000 new and the 2006 new. I call this review, ""close"" because just like Ford they almost get it and then drop the ball. Example, the front of the vehicle is spectacular, so is the side of  the vehicle. The backend....boring. The back lights look like the were formed by the Keebler elves with a cookie cutter. Engine, wonderful.  Transmission, has a mind of it's own. Fit and finish ,more rattles than a maternity ward...Great comfort. The cas is a overall fun car that was overpriced by 10k. "
lincoln,ls,2006,massimo, 07/28/2007,Buy one - do it!,4,"I never thought that this car had everything I was looking for, but it does and I still look forwrd to driving it. In the last 10 years I have had 6 BMW's (an M3 and the rest 5- series) and 2 Saab's.  To be honest, the beemers were overhyped, the Saab's were awesome, but were always in thw shop. This LS is great. The looks are understated and the motor has a strong powerband."
lincoln,ls,2006,McLovin, 12/10/2007,This vehicle is pretty amazing,4,"I have always liked the design of the Lincoln LS. Its smooth lines and luxurious interior give a lot of imports a reason for concern. The lines look very similar to that of the Mercedes Benz E-Class of recent years. Though at this point you will only find it used, buying one will be all but disappointing. I found a 2006 with 7900 miles on it and it's incredible. The V8 power kicks when you need it, the interior has every amenity you can possibly need and the overall appearance of the LS is solid. Rumor has it that Lincoln will introduce an MKS in mid 2008 (They have the MKZ and the MKX now). Is it reintroduction if the LS? We'll have to wait and see."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,GreatTruck, 10/07/2009,Excellent Truck,4,"This has been one of the best trucks i've owned! I had a Ford F-150 Lariat previously and this truck blows it away.  The exterior looks great along with the interior, the interior could be better quality in spots but overall it's pretty good. I put a lot of miles on it each year and only had one problem with one of the back up sensors, but Ford's great warrenty (50,000 bumper to bumper warrenty) backed me up and I didn't pay a penny. The gas mileage isn't bad for such a large truck I avg. about 14-15 in the city and 18-20 on the highway. This is a great truck and would recommend it to anybody. I'd by another one any day! Lincoln should have never stopped making this car,maybe they will again"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Charles, 04/24/2009,Ford Can Provide Warranty Parts,2,"At 25K, fuel injector failed destroying catalytic converter. Truck has been in shop 4 weeks. Converter on order for over 3 weeks & just slipped delivery another 1 1/2 weeks.  Ford replacement Catalytic Converters are not readily available.  If I used a Ford truck for a living I would be in serious trouble.  Dealership is not the problem as Ford cannot provide part required for repairs. Dealer has been in contact with Ford w/no results. Extended warranty would not have helped. Will this be the last injector failure???"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Gravy, 07/27/2010,Solid Truck,4,Bought this truck new and other than maintenance it was in dealer one time for rotors at 7K. Overall very happy with it and I am not a gentle driver. Gas could be better getting 9.5 in this heatwave. 
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,tracy, 09/10/2009,My NEW MOM Mobile,4,"I am absolutely thrilled with my ""new to me"" TRUCK.  I wanted to get rid of my MOM mobile safari van.  I wanted a ""TOY that was functional""  NO van and Not gray.  Was leaning toward a HUMMER and decided it would not be functional for our family.  We need to HAUL our toys in the back of a truck; 4-wheeler, kayak, motorcycle plus tow a trailer at times.  I get alot of compliments on my truck and people think it is brand new it is a 2006.  No buyers remorse here and so far it gets 17.3-18.2 MPG not to bad!! FUN to drive.  LOVE IT!!! PS.  My Husband and son had to modify the muffler to add ""rumble"" it was to quiet for them.  I have to admit I enjoy the rumble also.  Thanks Honey and my son!!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,benroyal, 11/22/2006,MARK LT,4,"The best vehicle I have ever owned!  It is a real ""head turner"".  Pretty truck inside and out.  Could easily be used to attend a black tie affair.  The only drawback is fuel economy so I still spend a lot of time in my work truck.  "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Don H, 12/27/2006,Remarkable Truck,5,"This is by far the best truck I have ever seen (and I live in San Antonio, TX).  Gets comments everywhere I go.  Power and fuel mileage are extremely good for a truck this large.  Plenty of room inside and out for how I would use a truck.  Stereo even impresses the kids -- the subwoofer will make the cars around you shake. The real wood trim is so smooth, you have to look twice to realize what they are.  The chrome running boards look great with the rest of the truck, and are very functional with the rubber inserts."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,ghost-flame, 06/26/2008,Best truck I've ever owned,4,"True Lincoln. I have had many Fords and Chevy trucks. This is my 1st Lincoln. An accidental purchase. I was in the market for an F-150 Lariat. By the time I added the options I wanted this truck was $3,000 cheaper and it was on the dealer's floor. I have about 33,000 miles on it now and it is still like brand new. Comfort is as good as my bros 75k Mercedes. The fit and finish- cut above the F-150. I have had no problems. My only beef, but a big vehicle, is the gas mileage. I get 12mpg ave. What can I expect? With gas at $4.20 a gallon it's no fun. Perfoms great, love on long trips. Step on the gas and let the horses loose! I would buy again. I will keep this truck till it dies! "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,BadLT, 08/27/2009,Just got rid of this piece of junk,2,"Bought the truck with 36K miles on it from  the dealer.  Ran great for a month and then went to hell.  1 year and a settlement from ford later...yes I said settlement on a used truck, the tranny is shot, rear end is shot tie- rods are shot, it leaks water and the roof rattles.  Dealer told me 7K to fix everything...by the way the truck only has 54K miles!.  Great looking truck..and easy to look at cause it was never running."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Jeff B, 03/17/2007,F150 with a cool plastic grill,2,"I fortunately only leased this vehicle for 2 years. It's a great looking truck that gets a lot of compliments.  The main problem is that the seats look good but are hard as a rock and terribly uncomfortable even on short drives.  The Interior looks good but has cheap materials, and is nearly exactly the same as a Ford F150.  This is a truck with truck capabilities. I also have 4 Chevy Avalanches in my 40+ vehicle fleet and would rather drive one of them hands down. You'll get much better fuel mileage as well.  This is a well built ""truck"" with terrible seats, and terrible fuel mileage of 11-12mpg average. 20% better on the Avalanche."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,slim, 09/27/2006,Not as good as it should be,2,"Dealer was the best i've ever dealt with. The truck is beautiful (burgundy color) and gets lots of compliments. Air wouldn't blow cold at idle unless it was a overcast day and it had no power at all. Probally the weakest vehicle i've ever owned. The local dealer said they just reset the computer code and all was well. Not so , the air blows cold MOST of the time but it still has NO power and the gas mileage is terrible. not really a lincoln, just a F-150 with some chrome. Lincoln can sell it off the name and the looks but they really need to make it a Lincoln for those that know the difference.  "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,James, 06/03/2008,Great Truck!,4,"I have really enjoyed this truck! I used it as my daily driver for about a year, when I sold one car and was not sure which car I wanted to get next. This truck gets lots of looks and compliments, and it functions quite capably as a ""truck"" too! I have used it often to haul dirt, mulch, rocks, brush, trash, you name it - it does it all with style. It does a great job towing a 24 foot boat as well. Everyone who has ridden in it has commented on how nice the interior is and how comfortable it is. I haven't put a lot of miles on it (16,000) but it has not given me any problems.  I have heard they are not going to build it after 2008, which is disappointing because it's really a great truck!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,skiboy90, 03/07/2009,Best Vehicle I've ever owned,4,"Just bought this truck not to long ago, and it has to be the best vehicle i've ever owned and i've owned a lot of vehicles in my 58 years. The ride is smooth for a pick up, the interior is good, with the exception of some plastics, the stereo is excellent, and it hauls my 7000lb camper with no problem. As good as this truck is, it could have better MPG's, 16 on the highway going 80 is ok but i'd prefer 20 at least. Other than the fuel econ i have no complaints at all. Very good buy"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,RON HALVIN, 04/15/2005,Lincoln lt performance,4,"Our 3000 mile trip from florida to michigan and back was in style, comfort, easy handling, gas milage and dependibiltiy, this truck is a sure winner.  Pulling a large tandem trailer, it still performed beyond my expectations.  Truck pulling fully loaded tandem trailer, averaged 16.5 Mpg."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Jeremy, 01/09/2006,Very Happy!,4,This is the truck for those of us who said they would never drive a truck. Unlike the EXT it is a real truck. These are the most comfortable seats I have ever had in a SUV.  I am very happy with it and people look at it everywhere I go.  Sure it could be faster and the mpg isnt the greatest but you know that going in.
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,AutoTerry, 06/04/2006,Fantastic Truck,4,"We looked at all makes including the Import Trucks and not one could compare. The Lincoln offered Luxury at its finest and the ability to have a usable bed for hauling, unlike the Cadillac's. The review by supposedly industry critics that ding it for not offering a Navigation system is crazy, the better option here is to buy a Garmin that you can move from vehicle to vehicle and update via the web! The truck has all the luxury comforts, individual style, guts, and looks incredibile! The imports that get all the rave reviews, did not compare. The Cadillac is awesome but so is the price tag! The Lincooln fit a perfect nitch! Great job Lincoln! We Love it and the quality is A1!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Now a happy customer, 07/27/2005,Now a happy customer,4,"I recently purchased a new Mark LT 2006, my first experience with a lincoln (ford) product. i was very hesitant because of the ford reputation of breaking down all the time. The first day with my new truck the entire electrical system went out, and the interior started to fall apart. I called the dealer, and they came and picked me up 35 miles away!!! Then gave me the the option of fix my truck, money back or to pick a different Mark LT of my choice. I selected a different model and though it runs great the quality of the plant needs work. It is missing moldings on both sides. I am pleased with the MARK LT, the attention to detail from the plant is really poor. "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Gary Del Piano, 11/19/2006,Gorgeous truck,4,"The Lincoln Mark LT truck is an elegant version of an F-150 Lariat. It drives like a luxury SUV with absolutely no ""trucky"" feel, making you forget  you're driving a pickup. The engine is smooth, strong, throaty. Transmission shifts seamlessly during cruising. Body fit and finish is impressive. The stereo pumps. The shortbed has generous cargo space and extends to 8-ft with the tailgate down. There's lots of plastic on dashboard, but is tastefully done and durable. The Lincoln trim makes it more mature and sophisticated than an F-150. Negatives: the leather may be bit delicate, rear seat backrest too straight up, no overall difference than an F-150 Lariat, which sells for $6,000 cheaper.   "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,JT, 05/12/2006,VERY disappointed,3,"I'm amazed to read all the positive reviews. Since purchasing 4 months ago, it has been in the shop 5 times for quality & build issues.  2 trim pieces were improperly installed at factory using FORD trim pieces that did not even match.  The entire steering column had to be replaced due to an incessant rattle (manuf bulletin). Supports in the headliner were not properly fastened causing excessive overhead rattling. Two dealers can't seem to balance the tires. CHEAP plastic abounds in the interior, and the adjustment for tilt steering is primitive. This thing drives and handles like a beast, the seats are unsupportive and uncomfortable, & the paint has runs in it. 50K for this??? "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,doc casey, 08/28/2006,Gentelman's truck,4,"This is one of the most comfortable and smooth riding vehicles I have found. I added a lot of after market items like Vogue tires, rims, tonneau cover, rain guards,etc. The only ghing I havent seen is more of these on the road..whats up with that? in a year driving from here and visiting Hawai I have noticed about six.  I think if you added the things I did at the showroom more would be on the road.  The only problem I have found is the after market splash guards, Huffy custom made would be better.  I would love to show my truck in your dealership and people would buy more. As it is on the floor it just doesnt have the bling.  To bad cause it is a great truck.hope I didnt buy a Blackwood.chow"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Mark LT, 05/11/2005,Mark LT misses the Mark,3,"I have owned this vehicle one week.  Here is what I consider Lincoln missed in the Mark LT   Storage - non existent - no room for first aid kit, jumper cables and misc.  Rear seat does not fold down. Rear seats fold up, however NO storage underneath.  Radio - CD does not shuffle without manual intervention.  Odometer - does not have 10th of mile.  Memory seats - does not adjust mirrors.  Lumbar Support - manual - should be push-button.  No light under hood.  Hood latch not user friendly.  Plastic like grill flimsy.  Running boards - black and shows ALL the dirt and dust .. should have been chrome with Lincoln inserts. Certainly not designer chic.  "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Roy Ford, 04/12/2005,2006 Lincoln Mark LT,2,"Traded a Cadilac Escalade for the new LT. After a few weeks of owning the vehicle my impression is that Lincoln missed another opportunity.  The interior is inferior to the Cadilac, there is no Nav system offered, the sound system is basic, only one 12v power source, the back seat rattles, no wood steering wheel, just an F150 with a little xtra. A swing and a miss."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Anthony Chohonos, 05/01/2005,Sweet Truck,3,"This truck is just beautiful.  If you are looking for a pickup that can haul pretty much anything, this is the one.  Looked at Titan and Ram first but liked this one the best.  The interior is wonderful.  If you're looking for a hot truck, this is the one!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,keith poirier, 07/10/2005,owner,4,"Truck is good, with the exception of the tires, they are passenger tires and the side bow out when a trailer is towed. they are not safe for this vehicle. Why weren't light TRUCK TIREs put on the vehicle to meet standard regulations for selling what you advertise? "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Sam, 07/26/2005,Is it a Lemon or Just a Fluke?,4,Had the car for a month and it has been in the service department for more than a week. I really love this truck and want it back once service fixes the faulty driver seat track and does something about that high pitch noise that I get from und the hood at freeway speeds. My wife says it give her a headache and I agree because i get one from the nosie too. Again I love this truck and just want it to be normal.
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,jeff, 12/14/2005,truckin n style,4,"Pros- Handles bumps and rough roads like a dream, very quite. awsome stereo. interior looks great. great job with soundproofing interior. excellent ride hieght. decent power compared to my 01 GMC. Cons- ash tray rattles. problems with starting after short trip to store takes several attempts to start (intermittent). rough idle. Stick on simulated navigator tail lights (kinda Griswald looking)"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Jeanne Clark, 01/10/2006,This Girl's Truck,5,"Silly Boys...Trucks are for Girls!  This is the greatest truck ever built.  I love my truck and have even named her ""Big Bertha"".  She is certainly a man intimidator!  Her performance and styling is superior.  She pulls a trailer or boat like there is nothing in tow.  This is one mean truck and I will have her for many years to come. My Thanks to Lincoln for the Mark LT. "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Texcursion, 01/21/2006,Great Truck,5,"This is definitely a Guy car, very cool interior, good engine, great gas mileage for being a V8. Awesome sound system.  Owners will be definetly happy with this truck, unlike the Blackwood, this is meant to be what it is, a very good looking F150 like truck, except with tons of class."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Big Dan, 01/25/2006,Head Turning Ride,4,"From kids to adults they all stop and stare!  Great style and presence makes the Mark LT turn heads.  With the chrome running boards and bed liner this is one sweet truck!  Those that say it is just a tricked out Ford F150, its no different from the Chevrolet Avalanche to the Cadillac Escalade EXT but $10,000 less. With the superior interior comfort and room,along with sirrus tunes you can go cross country pulling your belongings and get out feeling like a king!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,JB, 03/11/2006,Phat Ride,4,"I'm 23 and this is the my 3rd brand new truck I've bought. . . chevy, dodge, now lincoln.  I shoped around and this is the best truck for the price (39 mo. lease) and all around package.  Looks sharp, rides smooth over bumps, perfect size, drives and handles like a car not a truck.  Pleasurable driving experience."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,HOWARD, 03/14/2006,I'm a lincoln not an F-150,3,It drives nice and the ride is very comfy. I like the outside look of the vehicle and had a lot of compliments.

I am very impressed with the ride compared to the F-150 and the Lincoln look and feel are great. A lot of heads turn when they look at my Mark-LT and I keep it looking clean and shining all the time. My only cornern is that I am struggling to get 12.5 miles to a gallon in the city. I haven't really had it on the highway for any extended period but I would suspect that I might get about 17-18 MPG at best. I had the dealer put on the chrome step bars, bed liner, bed extender and hard cargo cover which looks great. "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Don, 07/27/2006,Best vehicle I've ever owned,5,"This is the best vehicle I've ever owned!  Absolutely nothing wrong in 28,000+ miles!  I get 19 mpg on the road @ 65 mph.  About 15 mpg city.  It is by far the quietest pickup made anywhere today, period!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,D Money, 08/07/2006,It's Just Not Fair!!!,4,"What can I say? Ford Motor Company has a legend with their F150, and to make the Lincoln Mark LT ~ it's a Cherry on the Sundae! TONS of Compliments! Have had my truck for 3+ months and still have people coming up to me asking what kind of truck I drive. It's just not fair for the other auto makers, I guess. (Ford F-Series , BEST SELLING TRUCK FOR 30 YEARS!!!)  WOW!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Billy Vung, 07/29/2005,Luxury Truck Fighter,4,"This is my first Truck.  I have tried others truck: GMC Sierra Denali, Tundra Limited, Titan LE, Dodge RAM Hemi, Chevy Silverado LT, Nothing come near my need (very smooth drive, very quite interior). This is the truck that is as beautiful as my wife. I spent most of my time riding this truck more than I spend with my wife.  If you're looking a lexus from Ford, this is the one truck that you should not miss.  Anyone who buy this truck should not care about towing or real off road vehicle.  If you need real truck, buy Chevy, Dodge, Toyota, and Nissan. Anyone hate this truck and write bad review for this truck, he is on the wrong truck.  This is the perfect truck for a business person."
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,ken, 08/02/2005,Merk LT,4,This is a great truck even though it's only a glorified F-150. I like the unique interior and exterior trim upgrades. I have found numerous small factory defects in trim that I find totally disappointing. There are not the options that are available in the Navigator which is also disappointing. If thery were targeting an F-150 buyer to move up the both hit and missed the mark. Put the options in it that the Navigator has.
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,TruckinLincolnstyle, 08/08/2005,Just what I needed,4,"The Lincoln Mark LT is awesome for its first year, the exterior design is so sexy and big everyone just has to look, the chrome running boars add to the chrome on the side of the truck and the grill.  The power sunroof and power sliding back window is so cool.  Luxury in a truck, this is it.  looked at pretty much every other truck and just saw this big red beauty and 3 days later it was mine.  If you dont like the features in the truk why would you buy it in the first place? to complain? good idea...ya right."

lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Gammajune, 08/22/2005,Leased It - Love It - It Is A Lincoln,4,"Picked It Up on August 1.  My husband is skilled trades at the Rouge Truck Plant, and the minute he saw it completed, knew we were upgrading from the F150 this lease term.  Plus, great price and incentives for employees to GET IT OUT THERE and be seen! We had add-on steps installed - they only add more to the truck - have very visible chrome and make it pop even more.  We tow a 7200 lb trailer, and there is no comparison between the F150 and Lincon LT - no shaking, no strain on engine: just a smooth luxury tow ride.  Without towing it, just an great, as expected, Lincoln ride, only it is a Truck!  Talk about stares, everyone smiles at this truck - no usual blah F150 is this Baby!   "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,D>Rivera, 11/09/2005,marklt,4,"Being the first year the Mark LT was added to the Lincoln line-up as a pick- up, I was impressed with its style and handling capability.

I am extremely impressed with this vehicle and the value it represents. While this Mark LT is my first experience with Lincoln, I have owned several Cadillacs and I must say this luxury vehicle is tight, quiet and pleasing to drive.  I first discovered the Mark LT on Lincolns web site where 360 degree views and driver simulation was possible.  A few days later I saw one driving down the road.  Hours later I was driving one off the lot.  That was two months ago.  I thoroughly enjoy driving this vehicle every chance I get.     "
lincoln,mark-lt,2006,Adam, 11/22/2005,Many of Compliments,4,Since I picked up my Mark LT I have received nothing but great comments. It handles better than most cars with the security of a truck. I love all the options but it is not gaudy like some of the other luxury vehicles. I highly recomend.

The exterior is so tuff, everyone looks.The interior is incredibly comfortable, nicer than my Acura RL. We tow a boat on a tandem trailer (about 7500) pounds and you can't even tell it's there. I've driven it across state, was worried because it seems so big, and it was perfect. Comfy, roomy, tremendous stereo, all the features are on the wheel or within easy reach. The chrome runnings boards are so cool. We have never had a single problem with this truck. We would definitely buy this vehicle again. "

lincoln,mark-lt,2007,dga57, 12/31/2006,Love my 2007 Mark LT,4,"After owning five Ford pickups, the Mark LT seemed the logical ""step up"".  As nice as the Lariat and King Ranch Fords are, Lincoln takes it up another notch.  On the open road it is nearly as comfortable as my 2004 Town Car and/or the 2000 Navigator I had before that.  I like the fact that it's based on the F150 because it is a tried and proven vehicle yet offers a more luxurious ride than I've had from my previous trucks.  It's a definite keeper!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,john, 09/28/2006,new 07 mark lt,3,"I decided on the Mark Lt after driving many trucks but always wanting more typical luxury features. I personally do not care that it is based on the 150 as that is a good truck- I view it as a luxury package on that truck. With the monochrome package and everything but rear dvd it is a great driving experience on the road, but the size, for me, makes it difficult for short shopping trips. I had an 05 tacoma that was a great truck but too basic. The looks of it are stellar, the ride height awesome, the luxury features the best available, and to me, ford is the mercedes of the truck category. Buy it if you really like the f-150 but want more luxury features, looks and exclusivity."
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,sae185628, 11/04/2009,Need to improve the outlook on luxury,3,"I bought this truck because it was dealer used and had only 12,000 miles on it.  The truck rides great and seems to have power although I have not towed anything with it.  Visually its a beautiful truck, but it has errors that should not be on luxury vehicles.  The chrome rocker panels are wavy looking.  The drivers seat is already showing signs of tear and wear with only 13,100 miles on it.  The shifter feels cheap and the gas mileage is horrendous.  12-13mpg average.  The touch screen for the radio and navigation is a pain to scroll through.  No rear air controls.  The brake dust is comparable to Mercedes and BMW."

Lots of features including moonroof, navigation, satellite radio, traction control, park assist, and excellent seating with good leg space in front and back. Rides good, looks good and get lot of people who see the exterior and want to see interior. All who look say wow! Nice truck. Driver and passengers have good seats with a good view. Has a four year bumper-to-bumper warranty, 5-year roadside assistance and 70,000 mile powertrain, plus first year maintenance is free. Beats the warranty on most other trucks. Glad I bought my Lincoln Mark LT. Love it!"
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,john, 12/05/2006,not as good as it looks,3,"the lincoln mark lt looks like a winner, but it is covering just an average truck. the quality control from the factory needs improvements. Many thing were not correct on the delivery of the vehicle and has taken a lot of personal time to try and correct unfinished items on the truck. I would not recommend this truct to any of my friends."
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,Sharon, 08/30/2008,My Truck,4,"I like to drive this truck. I am a 5' 4"" woman drove 7,000 miles in nine days PA to CA and back to PA. My truck preformed great.  Had some problems with the chrome wheels peeling, Lincoln replaced all four. "
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,swanana, 01/24/2012,Not like just another truck. If you want to turn heads this is for you.,4,"Yes, all and all it's a glorified F-150, but the menacing grill can't be stopped.
Strangers are always giving me compliments on this truck.
It is has it all function, luxury, and a touch of American gaudiness depending on how much chrome you add."
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,Black Beauty, 12/31/2007,Black Beauty,4,Excellent appearance. Not your everyday work buggy. Quiet and solid build; however many of the interior dash components are very dated and not cutting edge you'd expect for a vehicle that has a MSRP or 47K plus. Spend a couple more bucks and install gauges with wow!  Improve fuel MPG.
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,MajorGeek, 03/01/2007,Love it,4,"Bought this towards year end with a great deal having owned an Aviator before. Needed a pickup that I could throw stuff in and haul with occasionally, but with luxury items. It drives great, is super comfortable and draws a lot of looks still. Plenty of horsepower and ride quality.  I have treated this truck, on quite a few occasions, like a old work horse. I have hauled a couple yards of gravel with it, it did not break a sweat. Launched jet skis in a non launch area, off road, and of course, Syracuse, NY salted roads. The Mark LT has no surprises, it's a sexy, over the top F150 for those who want a pickup truck with the luxury items found in many cars today. Just a great truck."
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,Cobra Phil, 01/02/2016,2007 LINCOLN MARK LT- A GREAT OPTION OVER THE F-15,5,"I had to replace my 1998 F-150 that had 189KMI. Looked at the various F-150 variants then I looked at the Mark LT. It has a very refined look with the toughness of the F-150. The seats seemed more comfortable and interior trim refined. Love the super crew 4 doors. All kinds of room. After 75KMI the exterior looks perfect with the exception of the chrome wheels are starting to peel. Interior looks perfect especially the leather. Gas mileage averages around 17.5 MPG but you can see 22.7 on the highway. My 1998 F-150only averaged 15 with a smaller V8 and only a supercab. Too bad Ford only builds for Mexico.....Bring this truck back to the US.

Think of the Mark LT as an appearance package with the same great rugged reliability of the F-150. This is a good looking truck!
"
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,Roger, 08/02/2008,Vibrating Down the Road,2,"Extremely disappointed. Expected quality ride, however truck constantly shakes when driving, regardless of speed; and shimmies when brakes are applied. Have been to dealership 3 times and service manager responds with ""I hate Ford;  that's as good as it's going to get"".   Would not recommend this truck or dealership. If you go over a bump, the back doors sound like they aren't completely closed, which of course means truck is not as quiet inside as you would expect.  Also, for a truck with under 10,000 miles, it idles roughly. I expected much more for the price. After meeting with owner, I expected some resolution rather than ""it drives better than my Ford 350""."
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,j hibbs, 03/22/2007,2007 lincoln mark lt,4,"very few on the road, so you stand out in this truck. i like the exterior styling along with the performance it offers. interior is comfortable. it is basically a fancy ford, and you get everything that entails owning a ford, good and bad(good looks and performance along with spotty build quality and questionable reliability). fuel mileage is poor(11 mpg in the city, up to 19 mpg on the highway at 70 mph), but it is a truck and can be used as a truck(4wd with 8600 lb. towing capacity). even with the negatives of this truck, i really enjoy driving it and would buy it again"
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,Ken, 03/25/2007,Great Truck,4,"Love the truck! GREAT on the highway going from job to job. But, also very functional once on the job. Really have had no problems other than difficulty in keeping wheels balanced. "
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,dallasdon, 04/09/2007,First Blush,4,"First week for '07 LT  following a Lexus LX470. Simply awesome. Usually buy ""barely used"" for the big discount, but such LT's available were priced out of line. This gorgeous, max-optioned new '07 was $45,590 MSRP, and the dealer dumped to $35,500 with no sweat. Best $35k vehicle in the world. Smooth, quiet, sexy attention grabber. Good for work, play, luxury night out, pick-up clients, road trips, you name it. Yes, they missed a few minor things, but don't dwell. So far, most enjoyable vehicle ever purchased. Wouldn't be quite as thrilled at $45k, but at $35k, it's a no-brainer route to vehicular contentment."
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,Ken, 07/19/2007,Talos1,4,I have owned 16 new vehicles since 1966 and I have gotten more complments on the Mark LT than any other vehicle. The ride is pure Lincoln and the styling is turning heads. Thank You Ford for such a beautiful truck!!!!
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,Jeffrey Berezo, 11/26/2007,Awesome Luxury Truck,5,"I love my Mark LT, it is white chocolate with all options.  It is luxurious, comfortable, the black leather seats are like sitting in your family room.  I bought the are tonneau and had it painted to match. We drove it on a long trip over the weekend, it was incredible. The nay sayers must be GM people since there are no other luxury trucks on the market.  I do not like the Cadillac it is not a truck."
lincoln,mark-lt,2007,White Chocolate, 04/13/2008,White Chocolate,4,Looks great with 20 inch wheels and the paint job. Good feel driving it and good sound from the Sirius stereo. 
lincoln,mark-lt,2008,Fishin' Dude, 01/24/2009,Nice Truck,4,"The Mark is a pleasant truck that will do all I ask of it in hauling a boat comfortably. I like the features of sunroof, heated seats, a tad of leather and satellite radio. The reverse scanning system is top-notch. I find the Mark is first and foremost a truck.  The Escalade, my other consideration was too elaborate for my needs.  "
lincoln,mark-lt,2008,bar20, 01/24/2009,"Not for everyone, but perfect for us!",4,I am 61 my wife is 55. This truck meets our needs perfectly. We wanted a truck that we could occasionly use for hauling as well as an excellent highway cruiser and mall hauler. We chose the white chocolate exterior and parchiment interior. I find the build quality to be excellent. Our truck did have a cloudy drivers side mirror and was replaced under warranty. The stereo with Sirius radio is outstanding. The 5.4L engine has plenty of power. My wife drove the truck from Palm Springs to the SF Bay Area a distance of about 600 miles and loved the way it drove and felt. There are still some 08's still available and I would say if you are looking for an upscale pickup this just might be it.   
lincoln,mks,2009,sully77, 12/30/2010,"You take the good, you take the bad...",3,"I purchased my 2009 MKS approximately one month ago.
Thus far I've had mixed reviews on it, but overall I'm happy with it.
I took it to the Appalachian Mtns of Virginia where I encountered 6"" of snow.
The front-wheel drive handled it without any issue's or problems."
lincoln,mks,2009,Gary, 08/29/2009,Are you kidding me?,5,"There is no car on the road better than this one for the price.  I decided to trade from my Caddy CTS and was ready to go back to previously owned models, and I've had them all.  Infinity FX, Acura TL, Mercedes S and E series, Lexus LS, I could go on and on.  If anyone had told me I'd end up with a Lincoln MKS I'd have laughed.  I had decided on a fully loaded Lexus GS350 when I drove this car.  My wife loved it, I was blown away by the technology and the combination of luxury and handling.  What's the rap from the Editors?  Good grief, there is no car on the road that compares at this price.  Perfect combination of luxury and performance from a guy that loves both.  Best car I've ever had."
lincoln,mks,2009,scott, 01/08/2010,The best of 52 cars I've owned.,5,"I got MKS in June 08 by accident. I have owned six Cadillacs, the last one being a $65,000 2005 sts.  I was tired of waiting for Cadillac to come up with something new in that size. The 09 MKS cost $21,000 less than the 05 sts.  Although not as agile and fast as the Cadillac, I find that I don't really need all that performance at the margins.  Simply put, this car has the best stereo and navigation system and is the quietest, most comfortable, most commented-on-by-strangers, most fuel-efficient (for its size) car I've had.  I drove 4,000 miles in ten days with nary a crick in the neck nor stress in the lumbar.  "
lincoln,mks,2009,James Idol, 03/30/2016,Much potential. Disappointing craftsmanship.,5,"I bought my 2009 MKS as a 3 year old Certified Preowned Vehicle. I was seduced by the technology, power, and handling. Ride is okay, but you feel the bumpy roads compared to my previous Town Cars. I was in the shop very often at the beginning. Fortunately, I had an extended warranty, but it was most inconvenient. I had to go in 3 times to fix 2 lumbar supports. Two of the door locks fell into the door. They never properly fixed the front seat back so it is not flush to this day. I had to take the car in 12 times to finally fix the AC. The air would blow erratically rather than with a steady stream. 
Strangely I love this car when it is in proper working order.
It's now 2018. After having the car for nearly six years, with 197000 miles, I love it. What a trooper. I've spent money to keep it in good condition, but it performs practically like new. At 9 years old, people think it looks new. It's my dear friend.
"
lincoln,mks,2009,daveh923, 11/21/2013,Little more thought would go a long way,4,"I have owned this car for a few months now and have to say it was an adventure with good and bad sides.
First off it takes a masters degree to learn to drive.
The car is not simple and will surprise you with the abilities it has.
For instance, you can set cruise control at 75mph and in traffic it will drive itself stopping and going.
Technology wise it is brilliant.
You can get traffic/weather on demand with the touch of a button.
The power is unbelievable, but the downfall is that sport mode will jerk you around like a teenager learning manual.
All in all, I'm happy with my purchase and will probably buy another one in the future.
Lincoln really did a wonderful job."
lincoln,mks,2009,irish35, 06/15/2014,Sweet ride for long drives,4,"Have had the car for about two years, and it has been a pleasure to drive. I drive long distances on the highway and no car would compared to MKS. AWD (and 19+ tires) gives you excellent traction on the road and in the snow. Comfortable seats, nice features, smooth handling, plenty of power. This car is not built for racing, correct. But it would not disappoint, and indeed makes you proud, when you punch it to pass foreign competitors up the hill.
Not 100% pleased with the interior design. Major issue for us (coffee drinkers) is that you cannot fit two coffee cups in this car; it has got space for 1-and-a-half!"
lincoln,mks,2009,pharaohfitz, 10/15/2014,Great Car - No Reliability Issues - Fast,4,"I don't understand the other reviews concerning reliability or performance.  I bought the 09 Lincoln MKS for my wife then she opted for the 2014 MKZ so I inherited the MKS.  Very quick acceleration, I use engine and oil treatments. 84K miles with no issues or any maintenance needed other than scheduled service.  I have photos of 30 mpg while driving @70 mph - so mileage is great, usually 26-28 but 30.5 is most I have observed highway but 17-19 stop and go.  Handles like it is on rails while driving through the mountains at @70+.  While not a sports car (79 RX7, 64 Stingray), it is a fast great handling car.  Driven at -35 up to 105, snow no problem"
lincoln,mks,2009,flaflamingo, 06/15/2014,A beautiful piece of junk,2,"This was the most beautiful car I have ever owed.
However, after being in the shop just first year over 10 times, the problems just got worse.
The first week I owned it, put the moon roof and it peeled the headliner back from the roof.
Then the driver's seat broke, 3 of the 4 locking mechanisms were replaced (this continued after replacing), AC would not be consistently cold, lumbar blew out in passenger side (also in driver's side 50 miles out of warranty), garage door opener never worked, door numbers worked hit and miss, swipe of numbers wouldn't work.
This went on up until the time I traded it.
They would not declare a lemon; Lincoln refused to work with me"
lincoln,mks,2009,S Posey, 10/22/2008,Smile big when they stare!,4,"I am 52 and have owned only GMC products in the past, so having a Lincoln / Ford product in my driveway says a lot for the  MKS! I had driven every Cadillac, Toyota, Nissan and Buick known to man and this  loaded beautiful Tuxedo Black Lincoln MKS won my heart. Such an awesome vehicle for the price. Fun to drive, a sports car and luxury car rolled into one. The leather seats are unbelievable,SYNC, bluetooth  phone, THX stereo, adaptive headlights and cruise, front and rear assists,Media Libary to  play all my favorite songs, name it... this car has every known wish list you could ever need! Did I mention 23 mpg at 1900 miles? And it will only get better. LOVE IT, LOVE IT !Join the FAMILY !"
lincoln,mks,2009,Purple Flag Saturday, 02/17/2010,Just Keeps Getting Better,4,"I was apprehensive about getting this car; a terrific lease sealed the deal. 17 months later: GREAT CAR! The MKS is ultra comfortable, elegant and looks like a million.  Sight lines require getting used to, after a while it's fine.  Heated/cooled seats, sound system, SYNC, all add up to a fabulous experience.  It was reinforced when I drove Chicago to Tampa at Christmas with 2 adults and 2 teens. Roomy, comfy, soooo quiet and happy to run 85+ all day long.  My first experience with Lincoln, not my last."
lincoln,mks,2009,cappecan, 03/04/2017,A REAL BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!,5,"I recently purchased my 09 MKS AWD with 99,000 miles on the odometer. I was a bit hesitant, but with it being a one owner car, I took the chance. Boy did I make a great choice. The MKS really is an overall superb vehicle. I think I got lucky with mine, because for having over 100,000 miles, and being 9yrs old, it drives like a dream, and is a very snazzy ride. The MPG is not great, which for a boat of a car with AWD, this is to be expected. The handling is not amazing, but works for most. One thing to keep in mind is the shear size of this car; it's huge! Maneuvering into tight spaces can present a challenge, especially in cities. I'm very grateful for the front and rear parking sensors, as well as the back-up camera. The layout of the dash is simple to use, and in my opinion, is not stuffed with too many buttons. The sound system is exceptional, and the voice activated navigation is a life saver when you need it. Seats are plenty comfortable, and provide adequate support for long trips. This is a Lincoln, not a Cadillac, BMW, or a Infiniti. It's not designed for fast cornering, races down the road, or hardcore performance. It's a luxury ""tank"". It seems to appeal more to the ""older"" generation, and is designed to perform as such. The available AWD is a must for snow country, and makes all the difference with snowy or icy climates. Tires are not cheap, and are a bit tricky to come by.  My only real complaint is that my sunroof does not work, which from what I've read, is a very common issue with these Lincoln vehicles. Other than that, I give it a two thumbs up, and a steal for just over $13,000.00.
"
lincoln,mks,2009,Ray, 08/20/2008,Lincoln MKS-Great Car,4,"To begin, I just purchased my MKS about a month ago so it has not been time tested in terms of overall quality. However, I have driven it over 1,000 miles in both city and highway conditions and found it just fabulous. No quality problems whatsoever.  This car is not the doggie Town Car, but it has the comfort and better performance. It may not take the 0 to 60 record but, its comes close to the Lexus LS series and has plenty of power when you need it. I have the fully equipped model with the Ultimate Package, that I highly recommend. Again, price comparing this car to the Lexus LS or ES series, you get a far better value equally equipped. It's not the old man's Town Car."
lincoln,mks,2009,schuhman, 01/12/2010,Solid,5,"I drove the Infiniti M and the Acura, comparing them to the MKS. After the drives it was a slam dunk, I bought the Lincoln.  I is a quick of the line, it looks better and the options closed the deal. I would recommend the care to anyone that wants great style, smooth ride and solid performance with every option. The sync system is great and I have downloaded every cd I like into the jukebox. The hands free nav, radio and systems are the cherry on top. My kids enjoy the dual moonroof and the adaptive headlights are a bonus I did not expect to enjoy as much I do. I put dark tint and it finished the car perfectly."
lincoln,mks,2009,medic, 05/05/2010,Missing storage,4,"Had this car for just a few weeks 09 leftover dealer driver car. Love the look and style but there is virtually no storage inside for anything. Small door pocket and mini center console that once you put in an iPod in to hook to USB it is full. Cup holders are useless with armrests extended, and with tapered coffee cups you can have only one and the other holder overlaps. I still love it though, shifts a bit hard between gears."
lincoln,mks,2009,dreamer, 04/28/2010,I wish I never bought it.,2,"It was my dream car before I bought it, now it is my nightmare.  I  have 20000 miles in it. I have had and still have many issues with this car,  and I seriously regret to buying it.  During this time I had several rental cars while my car was being fixed, but all of them were far more responsive and sped up faster than my car,  even the cheaper/basic ones.   The service department at the Gengras Lincoln in East Harford CT is telling me that everything is fine with the car and it matches with the manufactures specification, the transmission hesitates to switch down or up, but this is how it was planned and supposed to work.  Needless to say when you spend this amount of money on a brand new "
lincoln,mks,2009,Nickolis, 04/24/2018,"I mean, it rides pretty smooth...",3,"I had just returned a lease and I didn't want to buy another brand new car. I knew I was going to be doing a lot of highway driving so I wanted something comfortable. The Lincoln is incredibly comfortable. The engine is powerful and cruising along is a breeze. For context, I am 29 years old. Not the typical car of a 29 year old. When you think Lincoln, the first thought is usually the Town Car. This isn't your grandpa's Town Car though. I really do like this car. It is beautiful. There is a big BUT, though. I didn't get all of the super fancy tech and I regret it for the sole purpose of reversing in this car. The visibility out of the rear is horrid. The backup sensors work but are incredibly slow to respond. I can't believe this car doesn't have a reversing camera. It's incredibly dangerous, if I'm honest. The base stereo sounds great, heated front and rear seats plus cooled front seats work great, Xenon headlights (non adaptive in the base form) are okay. My Hyundai's Xenon headlights seemed a lot more crisp and had better focus. Then there is the issue with storage. This car basically has 1 cup holder. The arm rest is weird because if you slide the padded sections forward, they block your cup holder. I've also learned that they must be slid forward just a touch before opening the armrest or it will catch on the back part and try to break itself. This car... I can't say I'd buy another one. I don't hate it and I will probably drive it for many more years. I just wouldn't make it my first choice.

1 year of ownership update: I’ve been driving this car for just over one year now. In that year, I’ve reflected quite a bit about this purchase while sitting in traffic on my way to and from work. 

Performance: The Lincoln has a strong engine. It has plenty of passing power, merging power and surprisingly gets decent mileage on the highway. The transmission is lazy. It’s slow to react, shifts hard and hunts for gears. 

Comfort: Finding a comfortable seating position is quite easy. The seats offer plenty of support, the heating and cooling functions work well. On long trips, we really enjoy this car. It has a power adjustable steering wheel that I wish would telescope more. 

Interior: The interior is so frustrating to me. The panel on the side of the drivers seat is broken. The clips that hold it on are small plastic pieces that won’t hold up well over time. I’ve expressed my frustrations in the initial review about the center console. That is still a huge annoyance. The interior panels have started rattling and I HATE the head unit for the radio. 

Safety: Horrible. I learned about the independent group that crash tests vehicles. I sincerely hope we’re never in an accident in it. It will not go well. Had I known about this before, I would not have purchased the car.

Technology: lacking behind the competitors of the same year, in base form. 

Reliability: holding up really well!! I had to fix one thing that cost $30 (I was able to do it on my own.)

Value: I feel there are many other vehicles that have a stronger value. I should have done more research before making this purchase. I paid $12k for this car last year and now I’d be able to sell it for about $8k. I understand that cars depreciate. This just seems to depreciate more than “normal”. 

In a brief summary, It’s a nice enough car that I would never purchase again. Because of the concerning crash test ratings, I will not be keeping this car for much longer.

Years 2 update:
We are planning to trade this car in for something else when the pandemic threat is gone. Over the past year we have had many electrical and mechanical issues surface. The radio no longer works, high beams don’t work most of the time. If you want them to come on you have to make 6-7 attempts before they’ll actually flip on. The transmission is having issues. We have a horrid scraping noise coming from the
 front right while driving along. Overall, this car is not holding up to the test of time. Sadly, we have fewer than 80,000 miles on it. It’s been a car that we use to drive to the office everyday (20 miles one way on the highway) and we do all of the maintenance. It’s a huge disappointment and I can not wait to get rid of it. 

3 year update: we no longer own this vehicle. We now have a Sonata Limited and are MUCH happier!

lincoln,mks,2009,tgeorge1241, 02/17/2013,2009 MKS - A bad mistake,2,"I bought this car, loaded, used in the summer of 2012. Since it only had 17,000 miles on it I really thought it would be a good car I could drive for several more years. I sold it 7 months later. As far as I'm concerned Lincoln(Ford) builds nothing but junk. The acceleration was terrible; pokey and jerky. I'd be at a stop light with no one near me for miles and the side assist warning system would starting beeping. Two months in and part of the driver's seat fell apart and a piece of the grill fell out.
Gas mileage was terrible and in the rain the MKS drove skidded all over. I'll never buy a Lincoln or Ford again."

Initially when I leased it everything appeared to be fine.
About 1 mo. after lease, door locks began to malfunction opening by themselves without depression of the button on the key fob, next the rear doors began to collect water sounding as though a swimming pool was behind you.
The water slished and sloshed back and forth.
This was really scary! Next the Sync system has a problem.
You can hear all phone conversations like a loud speaker outside of the car!!!

lincoln,mks,2009,dlsexec, 08/30/2008,New owner,4,"We recently took delivery of a loaded MKS. The first thing you notice is the seating position is upright and high like a crossover. This is fine but takes some adjusting. The ride is sometimes a tad bouncy but nothing serious. The FWD is tight, effortless and about neutral on under/over steer. We also own a Lincoln LX and 7 Series BMW. The MKS is between them but much closer to the LX in ride. Gadgets are more than normal and trim level is way above average for a US product. All in all not a bad deal, but a long way away from the 7 on drivability. "
lincoln,mks,2009,EEG, 09/04/2008,"Nice Car, But Quality Control Problems",3,"The 2009 MKS has a lot of technology within the vehicle, but suffers from Ford/Lincoln quality. My new MKS has several issues which should have been detective by the dealer. First, paint is missing on the rear bumper cover seams, one side of the bumper cover is not flush with the 1/4 panel. There is a bur/bump on the edge of the trunk by the rear window. Also, there is some beige splatter underneath the clearcoat on the front fender and a crooked spreaker grille on the front dash. Having owned Acura, Lexus and Mercedes and all have been flawless, this is a huge letdown. The dealer now has to repaint/realign all these issues and the paint option was an additional $590. I will stick to the imports"
lincoln,mks,2009,Sim, 09/23/2008,Not a Towncar,4,"After leasing Town Cars for many years, I leased an MKS front wheel drive. Interior is luxurious, and sound system is excellent. However, there is poor rear window visibility as head rests block a smaller rear window. A 6 cyl, only getting 13.5 miles per gallon! Used to get 18 on my 8 cyl Town Car!

It arrived around Mid-September with 45.3 miles put on at the factory. It was the first time I ordered a new car from the factory and was very disappointed that it was driven by someone other than me on the highway. It took the excitement out of the experience. At first I wasn't going to accept it and after a few days I did. Upon close inspection I found 16 flaws in the paint. I feel I made a mistake purchasing an American car. "

I had a 2005 Chrysler 300C and loved that car, but nothing had changed in 4 years. I choose the MKS for a number of reasons. Aggressive appearance; loads of tech (Direct Ipod/Iphone support, Bluetooth, GPS, etc) Cooled seats. I avg. 23 miles in mixed driving which I am very happy with.  Buying a 1st year model is always going to have issues and I have one too. The driver's side door has problems unlocking.  Waiting for part to arrive."

lincoln,mks,2009,wfalden, 04/29/2009,First 180 days,4,To date the car has performed as one whould expect.  The six cyln engine is to small for the size of the car but does have surprising performance.  The auto has great electronic features while the inside looks nice but at a closer glance a lot of cheap parts.
lincoln,mks,2009,gary, 05/18/2009,New MKS,4,"Have owned MKS now for almost 2 months and overall I like the car.  One very annoying thing is the steering wheel cruise control WITH NO CANCEL button (must hit brake pedal)?  For a luxury car this is ridiculous when most lesser cars today include this feature.  Ride is a little hard compared to 06 Cadi DTS it replaced.  The economy on this car, though, is great ... haven't gotten less than 22 mi/gal yet!  Also have not been impressed with the transmission which is not real smooth"
lincoln,mks,2009,mjc, 08/14/2009,MKS great car,5,"I can  not understand why the ""experts"" say that this car is pricey.  I challenge anyone to find a luxury car with all the electronics and features that the MKS come with for this cheap.  My last two cars were Mercedes and BMW and the MKS hands down is  more sporty, more comfortable, nicer looking, and better value by far.  The 20 inch wheels is a must.  Navigation and Audio sys. is second to none.  Seats are the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in.  rear camera is nice.  Another thing the so called experts bash, is the acceleration.  This car has plenty of power, I agree its not a dragster by any means but it has plenty of acceleration.  Get more power they will complain about MPG!!!!!!"
lincoln,mks,2009,Winton, 10/16/2009,2009 Lincoln MKS 4dr AWD,4,The car glides and handles effortlessly.  Lots of interior room both in the front and back.  The Sync and Navigation systems are easy to use and work great.  I feel it's a good car for the money (despite the review from Edmunds) and would definately buy another one!  
lincoln,mks,2009,TK, 07/06/2010,Jury still out on this one!,4,With 8000 miles this one so far has had brake problems and acceleration issues that the dealership cannot seem to fix properly.  Pretty scary when you need the power and it's not there for you and when you need to stop quickly and get a crunching noise!
lincoln,mks,2009,brookse1, 02/26/2014,Can't score everything just yet...,4,"Wonderful car. Like driving your living room, with more toys. Lots of room, decent power, good looks. Brakes grab. Corners are wobbly but, *what did you expect*?
Better tires would help. 

Uploading CDs and pics is finicky - hello Microsoft! 

Overall, as long as the reliability holds up, I love it."
lincoln,mks,2009,Tim Layman, 02/08/2020,Great car,5,"I am a traveling salesman average 30,000 miles a years. My MKS AWD has 300,310 miles on it. I change oil about ever 3500 miles. The only thing I have had to do is put in a new oil pan, brakes, tires, and stocks. I change the plugs ever 100,000. I feel Lincoln made a big mistake down sizing this body stile. The Lincoln I had before this one was a Mark V11. I sold it with 423,000 miles on it. By the way my MKS still looks like new.

lincoln,mks,2009,Frank, 03/20/2009,Highway cruiser,4,"I drive a lot of highway miles for work and wanted a car that would make that as painless as possible. This car has met every expectation I had. Great ride, fun technology, great sound system, bluetooth and sync work flawlessly.  The transmission needs some work and a few more miles per gallon on the highway, this car would be perfect."
lincoln,mks,2009,joe, 05/20/2010,Cooled Seats?,3,I live in the great state of Texas where it's hot. I bought the car mainly because of the comfortable seats. The cooled seats were a great option to me and worked great at the time of purchase. Now the bottom part of the seat gets really cold and the back of the seat doesn't cool at all. It's been to the dealer 3 times. The first time they said nothing was wrong with it; they must not have looked very far. The second time I made sure to show them the problem; they repaired it. The seats worked great for 1 day. I brought the car back to them and now they say there is nothing wrong with them. They must be blind or don't know how to make the repair. I'm very dissatisfied with the dealer and the seats.
lincoln,mks,2009,jp, 09/12/2009,like driving a boat,2,have leased this car 6 months ago took it down south to the mountains and it was a very big disappointment the handling or lack of it makes me very sad about my decision to lease this vehicle
lincoln,mks,2009,Joe, 05/20/2010,Not Worth The Money,2,"Repeated problems with the seats; it's been in the shop for 2 weeks this month with 3 different trips. The dealer fails to see the problems with the car just because the computer isn't showing codes. I guess codes are better than people in determining problems. Yeah right. If my car was on fire and it didn't spit out codes there must not be a problem, right. I wish I could get my money back. I'm wondering if I can get the vehicle returned under the lemon law even if the dealer won't recognize the problems."
lincoln,mks,2009,fluffypuppy, 04/05/2010,Unhappy owner,2,"After my Lincoln Continental I have high expectation when I bought my Lincoln MKS. I wish I never did.  With the same problem I had to go 3 times back, before the dealership find the problem and then took a week to fix it.  It was a seal leaked the the seat circulated the burned oil into the cabinet.  I suffered head ache as result for months.  Also the car is underpowered, slow; the shift does not shift timely, while the engine roaring.  When I go down on a hill when other drives push the break, i had to puss the gas in order to keep up with the traffic; going up on a hill my car was not abble to go up I had to manually switch back the gear.  I am disappointed in this car."

lincoln,mks,2009,Mike, 09/19/2008,Critics are wrong,4,"I have had my MKS AWD for 2-months and absolutely love it!  The ride, handling, looks, and performance are second to none. Comparing this car to a Lexus ES-350, Volvo S-80 etc. is a joke. Daily driving does not require the use of a skid pad or some bogus zero to sixty times. Nice job Lincoln!"
lincoln,mks,2009,ponchoman49, 01/20/2009,Loses some of its Lincoln charm,3,"Just bought the new Lincoln MKS. The letter names car manufacturers are all going over to are getting confusing. Even the saleman had to think a second when I asked to see the MKS. That aside, this car provides reasonable performance, ride comfort and room. The electronic features are worthy such as SYNC which lets you store a load of songs on board and talk hands free on the phone. The front seats are comfy and rear legroom is abundant. The dash is well laid out and looks attractive. The exterior leaves me a bit cold however with it's plain slab sides and indistinct rear end treatment. The sides in particular are too plain and would benefit from a door molding to break up the tall doors. "
lincoln,mks,2009,paulie, 06/11/2009,GREAT CAR,4,"What is all the bashing about? The MKS handles the Ozark mountain roads at 60 MPH easily. There hasn't been one thing wrong in over 14K miles. OK. YOU show ME where you can get: Adaptive Headlights. Auto windhield wipers. Auto brights. Dual Sunrooof. Heated AND COOLED driver and passenger seating. Sync. Rear back up cam. Softest leather, other than one Lexus. AWD. Room for 5 and a living room sized rear seat. 275 HP on REGULAR. I got all of this for 41,000 in November. Come on, this is to easy. Now, you show me another that gives all this. You can't, so quit the bashing. "

lincoln,mks,2009,popeye1250, 09/05/2008,Lincoln got it right!,4,"Traded in the venerable Mercury Grand Marquis for the MKS and thought I was spoiled with the Mercury's ride. This car has a supurb ride and handles like a sportscar at the same time. The interior is more roomy than a Caddy STS and very comfortable! Excellent ergonomics! The ""Bridge of Weir"" leather from Scotland is absolutely the best and the recycled ash on the dash is exquisite! This car will go far faster than I'll ever need to go but it's fun to punch it at 25 mph and be doing 60 in about 3 seconds. Everything, paint, fit, finish, electronics, sound is incredable! And they tell me that after I have a few k on it that it will get up to 29 mpg highway. This is how cars should be built"
lincoln,mks,2009,JD, 09/16/2008,Ford Hits One Out,5,"This is the car that shows when pushed to the wall Ford can put out a very competative product. Before purchsing the MKS, I test drove the CTS, DTS, ES,Lucerne and Jaguar XF and I can say that the MKS has the best driving characteristics of the bunch save the XF. The car is very aggressive in appearance and performance and will surprise many with its accelration and handling. Don't be dissapointed by the 275 HP six cyllinder power plant as it is more than adequate. You will not lose this car in the parking lot. People who ask me about the car are surprised that this is a Lincoln. The car is worth serious consideration in this segment and with 1200 miles on the odom mph is above 21 mpg"
lincoln,mks,2009,baffled, 09/19/2008,One Great Lincoln,5,"Had the MKS AWD about a month now and I still can not believe I got this much vehicle for $47000. All the luxury competition in size is more money and none of them offer the technology of this auto. The interface between the navigation, phone, travel link, climate control is all voice activated. Heated and cooled front seats with heated back seats standard. Adaptive cruise control, headlights that move when you turn, front and rear parking sensors with a hugh screen back up camera, heck you can even download about 2400 songs to the car. Drives great with a nicely tuned suspension that is a great cross between sporty and highway cruiser, plenty of power. Shift yourself trans. Great car  "
lincoln,mks,2009,popeye1250, 10/21/2008,Cross Country trip,5,"Just got back from Reno, NV to Myrtle Beach S.C. and the odometer has 7,200 miles. You can do 90 mph in this car very comfortably. (in Wyoming) I averaged 26.6 mpg for the trip doing 80-85 most of the time. I got 28 mpg doing 70 for a good stretch so milage does improve with more on the odometer. Very comfortable car to ride in cross country! Engine and transmission performed flawlessly in the Rocky mountains. More than enough power. There were 3 of us and we had plenty of room for luggage. Gas mileage has inproved dramatically from when I had 1,000 miles on it! I ran it with ""regular"" gas. Changed the break in oil at around 1,800 miles."
lincoln,mks,2009,datagen, 10/25/2008,Another notch to put on Ford's gun,4,"As with many Ford products, many do not know how good Lincolns are. I have a 2004 Taurus, a 2006 Zephyr, and now my 2009 MKS. After doing the research at the Detroit International Auto Show this year, I order this car the following month. I have had it about 2 weeks now and I can tell you, it was worth the wait. You can see and feel the styling and luxury in this vehicle throughout. You can appreciate the long hours involved in the designed and engineering. There is no doubt that you get a lot of car for the money. I am current getting 18.3 mpg in the city. Not bad for a AWD."
lincoln,mks,2009,Mex-I--CAN, 11/01/2008,Excellent vehicle,5,"I got this vehicle in October, My first impression was the interior quality which is very good, the interior design is very appealing and has a lot of tech features which I found very useful. Performance is above-average for a large sedan of this size. Fuel economy has been average or better."
lincoln,mks,2009,David Muller, 11/29/2008,Power and gas mileage,5,"All being already said about the car in other reviews, I'll just say that when my wife drove the car for the first time she was so very impressed with the handling and the smooth ride that I was taken back by her reaction. She normally says a car is a car! The engine power is excellent and having had two Continentals with V8 engines, I really can't tell that I'm driving a V6. I have about 3500 miles now and just drove south on I-95 to FL going the speed limits (55-70) and got a max 31.4 MPG (29.5-31.4 avg. depending on speed)using regular unl. fuel. The car was carrying 4 adults with a full trunk of luggage.  "
lincoln,mks,2009,SBU, 12/05/2008,Door Lock and Brake Problems,4,I enjoy the design and comfort of the new MKS but it seems that there are still some mechanical issues to be worked out.  I have driven only 800 miles in my new car and already have had to have the front brake lining replaced due to poor initial installation.  The driver's side electronic door lock has also broken and the replacement part to fix the problem has not even been built yet (according to my dealer).  I must now manually unlock the door each time - not fun.
lincoln,mks,2009,MrMason, 12/14/2008,Quality and Value,5,"Feels like a much more expensive luxury car, gets a great reaction from people who look it over. A joy to drive with all the bells and whistles. Looked at BMW and Audi but didn't see enough of a quality and performance difference to justify the large price difference. Great value! Even a crooked Southern senator would love it"
lincoln,mks,2009,sean, 12/26/2008,Lincoln MKS,5,"I traded in an V8 LS for the MKS. At first I thought the V6 wasn't going to be quick enough, but after driving it I found it to be quite fast. The navigation is second to none and extremely easy to use. The handling is a little different then the LS but in a good way. It's a tad smoother and hugs corners just as well. The size of the interior is a big selling point for any family of four or a group of adults. The leg room and sits are near perfect. I plan to own this a very long time unless that Eco-boost engine is really something else. overall I'm extremely pleased with my purchase. kudos ford/Lincoln.   "

(I'm 6'2"") After extensive research, I found the MKS to be the best luxury vehicle that provided adequate interior room and still be somewhat sporty. So far I'm very please with the ride, performance and looks. The big discount also helped. I'm getting about 22.1mpg in town. "
lincoln,mks,2009,datagen, 01/25/2009,Good Marks So Far,4,"The car rides very smooth. Sometimes I think to smooth. Sometimes I have a hard time feeling the road. I guess I can chalk that up to driving less luxury vehicles. The differences from other vehicles just take time to get use to. The narrow rear window and high shoulders have made me adapt other processes that makes me safer on the road. The rear camera is a must, but do not depend on it totally. Always check the mirrors and all around the car.  The power is there and smooth as well. No raising of the front portion of the vehicle. It's like it glides up to speed quickly. Sometimes I feel like that I am in a starship and am pulling away from those who are behind me.  Fuel economy 18-21 city."
lincoln,mks,2009,CheyenneB, 01/28/2009,Love my Lincoln,5,I just cannot say enough about this car. I love it. I bought it in December because the lease was up on my 2005 BMW 530. Thank God I hated that car. I was going to buy an Infiniti but I wasnt impressed during the test drive. On the way home my husband and I drove past  and i instantly fell for this car in the tuxedo black with the cashmere leather. The amount of options that come standard is insane. I almost bought the base model but I loved the push start. I average 21.2 mpg city with premium. This is by far the best car I have ever driven
lincoln,mks,2009,Moms car, 01/31/2009,"Big, Beautiful, Safe, and Equipped",4,"Big a best buy. If you are looking for a safe luxury large sedan, big trunk, and technology, this is the car for you.  This is not the best handling but its good enough. If you want size and handling, you have to pay at least $75,000 for a European car.  The trunk will hold a couple of strollers, groceries, and a big diaper bag its huge.  The trunk hides all the mess that you carry and its safer to have things in trunk in comparison an SUV or crossover and it looks better too. The navigation is easy to use, the integrated mp3 is great the only thing I dont like is the rear visibility, but it has a rear view camera. "
lincoln,mks,2009,Dave, 02/08/2009,A Misanalyzed Great Car,4,"We just purchased an MKS AWD model for my wife - she absolutely loves it!  She loves the comfort, spaciousness, handling, performance, and level of luxury.  Although not a techni, she finds the Sync system a user-friendly and awesome capability.  Her car came with almost every option - it had suggested price of 45K, we paid 41K. I think the Edmunds reviewer needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  He wrote a review based on what HE expects and wants from the car.  My wife doesn't WANT his handling or performance; SHE likes ""lower-level"" handling (not crisp) and ""less"" performance (he calls it ""lackluster"").  Depending on what YOU want in a car, this is a great luxury car worthy of a look! "

Choose to purchase the MKS (Tuxedo black, loaded) after 6 months of research and glad I choose to stay with the MKS vs. going with the CTS. Pleasantly surprised with the performance of the V-6 after reading some of the reviews. Car must be purchased with the 20"" wheels which adds to the car appearance."
lincoln,mks,2009,LIZARDGIZZARD, 02/19/2009,"Great car, but needs more polish",4,"I have had the car since Dec 2008 and love it. The car has great appeal, good power, roomy, with a great nav and Sync system and overall very comfortable. However, I have to agree that the opening to the truck is small, considering the size of truck is so enormous. In addition, I have had some issues that are annoying, but do not deter me for my love of this vehicle. The transmission is a little rough around the edges and would shift harshly depending on the throttle input.  In addition, this car does not like the cold. Every time the temperature is below 20F, I am unable to get sound from my radio or the media center, until the car warms up. "
lincoln,mks,2009,patty radvansky, 02/24/2009,Too Many Quirks in MKS,3,"I have owned the MKS for 6 months & have had it in the shop 4 times.  The week after I purchased car the radio would not come on unless I cut the car on & off several times, plus there is a very loud popping sound from the speakers when I first start car. There are constant rattles in dash. These problems have been going on since I purchased car. They are not certain of cause.  Now I have a new rattle in the sunroof.The rattles are so annoying you have to cut radio up to drown out, since the radio does not work half the time this is a problem. Also cup holders are entirely too small. I have been in a rental 3 times since i purchased & currently in one now. Not Happy with purchase at all!"
lincoln,mks,2009,REWInAmherst, 03/15/2009,MKS Is An Awesome Car,5,"The 2009 Lincoln MKS is an awesome car.  I have previously owned 14 Lincoln Town Cars and 1 Lincoln Aviator and rate the MKS amongst the best of those vehicles when it comes to my driving and ownership experience. I do a great deal of highway driving for my businesses and the MKS drives and handles very well and is a luxurious and comfortable experience over many hours spent on the road between destinations. My MKS has the ""Ultimate Package"" with all of the technological toys and conveniences which I appreciate greatly. I highly recommend the Lincoln MKS to everyone who is seriously interested in a true American luxury sedan. "
lincoln,mks,2009,jacob, 04/05/2009,Great Package,4,"I really love the car. It has style,luxury appointments, and a thoroughly modern look. Ford learned alot from Jaguar,I feel they have incorpoated the same approach,quiet luxury. Even the dash looks like something Ian designed himself. Lots has been said about being underpowered. The engine delivers much to my satisfaction while keeping me away from the pump. It took restraint not to give this an 8 cylinder. Lincoln went the right direction, looking ahead to what gas prices will surely be again. MKS is not BMW and doesn't want to be, its more like Volvo meets Acura meets Lexus. Now meet Lincoln."
lincoln,mks,2009,GLS, 04/26/2009,Pleased MKS Owner,4,"I have had my AWD MKS for 2500 miles now. I am extremely pleased with how the car rides and handles. I have done alot of in-city driving, highway driving and have gone over the mountains in a snowstorm. The car passes all my tests. V-6 is sufficient for any situation. If you want a little more sporting feel, use the select shift. The car chews up bumps and makes you feel like your sitting in your favorite leather chair in the den basking in peaceful solitude. If that is what your looking for then the MKS delivers. In City fuel avg 17.4 mpg."
lincoln,mks,2009,gardnercha, 05/29/2009,Pleasantly Pleased,5,"Have had this car for 3800 miles and waited to write this review until I had some experience and a long trip before doing so.  At first I was not happy with navigation maps not being up to date, but since have used it and love it. The ride is OK compared to my 2004 DHS Caddy that it replaced. The seats are more comfortable and fit my body so well I was less tired on long trips. I just drove it 2000 miles and got nearly 27 MPG overall. Very pleased with all the technology and would recommend this car to anyone in this price range."
lincoln,mks,2009,D P Glusko, 06/19/2009,Thank you Lincoln,4,"My MKS has exceeded all my expectations after 25 years of Town Cars and Cadillacs. I am still delighted after 7 months of ownership. The black exterior styling is eye catching, the Linen interior is sharp, roomy & comfortable, and the ride is rewarding around town & relaxing for the long haul. I was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable the AWD was to drive and the 6 speed transmission is smooth as silk after it gets to 2nd gear. Engine power & sound are very satisfying and the THX sound system is awsome. I completely disagree with the mediocre MKS reviews written by the so-called experts."
lincoln,mks,2009,Linda McLellan, 06/22/2009,Lincoln MKS,5,"I have been extremely impressed with Lincoln MKS. It has excellant styling, comfort and performance.

lincoln,mks,2009,Keith Dunbar, 07/05/2009,Fabulous Car!,4,"Really delighted with this car. I've owned Audis, Alfas and lately a BMW 7. This car is right up there with them and more fun in many ways. It feels every bit the luxury car that it is. On the freeway it is an effortless, remarkably quiet cruiser. In town easy to drive. Overall very comfortable, great cabin; a nice place to be. Lexus watch out, this car is every bit as good as your equivalent GS430; in fact it is better looking, has more style and breaks from the bland, mundane approach of its Japanese rival.  Superb car all round, thoroughly recommend it. Test drive one and you'll be amazed. Remember, it is a luxury car; don't be put of by the journalists that don't measure it that way."
lincoln,mks,2009,Fantastic Car, 07/16/2009,This MKS is Fantastic,4,"This car is a pleasure to drive and have to disagree completly with the ""experts"". The ride is firm and comfortable, not like a tank like my brothers BMW. Options are endless and receive compliments on the looks and styling everyday. Except the fact that a american company has got it right on this one."
lincoln,mks,2009,StkJck, 08/15/2009,Stealth Luxury,4,I recently was in the market for a replacement car since my 06 300 SRT* lease was up. Searched for used 2006 750LI and Audi A8 and decided on MKS. Price out the door was almost the same. I think it was only prudent to get something more practical but still wanted the toys and boy does this have the toys. My MKS is loaded plus has the optional wood trim package ($400).  It is well worth it. It just highlights the luxurious interior.
lincoln,mks,2009,RC in Tampa, 10/30/2009,great american car,5,I have had the MKS for 4months and have thoroughly enjoyed it-The handling and styling as well as the high-tech features are impressive-I receive a compliment on how it looks from people on a weekly basis asking me what kind of car it is-I am pleased that I purchased it over the foreign selections I drove
lincoln,mks,2009,Winter, 01/28/2010,Undeniably Great Car,4,"I had been driving a Lincoln LS and loved the car so in my search I started with the MKS.  I loved it immediately, but test drove the VW CC and Acura TL. The TL was a decent car, but did not offer the same quality for the price. Having owned the car for one month, I continue to be amazed at the beautiful look of the car, the great Sync technology, and the comfortable feel of the car.  I did not want to buy another Lincoln, but it was an undeniably great car.  I actually got giddy when I drove into the Lincoln parking lot for another test drive.  I love it."
lincoln,mks,2009,tpk, 01/30/2010,Get a lot of looks!,4,"After driving SUV's for 10 years, decided to try a car again. Drove the big Audi, Lexus, Volvo, Benz, BMW and then the MKS.  Loved the interior and options of the MKS compared to the rest and bought it that day!"
lincoln,mks,2009,Floridian, 03/23/2010,Whatta Deal,4,"An unbelievable fun car to drive.  Bought a 2009 ""leftover"" with a great rebate from the manufacturer.  Looked around at a lot of mfg's and models and the MKS stood out.  No regrets in purchasing this vehicle or the value for the money.  Thanks to edmunds.com, was able to negotiate a good deal, actually got a better price for this new vehicle (only had 110 miles) than Edmunds had listed for a Certified Pre- Owned."
lincoln,mks,2009,Carolyn, 04/01/2010,Great Car,4,"This is a great vehicle, to travel back and forth from up north to Fl. It has a large trunk, is very comfortable, handles very good on the highway. The voice command system allows me to call on the phone, without using my hands, the satellite radio, allows me to listen to the same station for the entire trip.  This car has good pickup when entering the interstate highways and the braking system is very good at stopping quickly, if needed.  I feel very safe in this vehicle, because of the safety equipment that is built into the car. I would recommend this vehicle highly. "
lincoln,mks,2009,Rob, 08/05/2010,Love it!,4,"After 40 years of driving nothing but Caddys I got an MKS because Caddy was no longer leasing. Love the ride, handling, sound system. Sync is SO easy to use. Gas mileage could be better. Biggest complaint is front seat bottoms could be at least 1 1/2 inches or longer. Not enough thigh support. Controls easy to read & reach. Love the steering wheel controls including being able to make phone calls. Outside mirrors a good size too. Like rear view camera, audible warnings on front & rear bumpers.

lincoln,mks,2009,Captain Gary, 12/11/2018,Phenomenal stereo,5,"My vehicle has the Technology and Ultimate packages, the THX stereo w/14 speakers(2 sub-woofers) and 600 watts is the best I've ever heard.  I can store 2,200 titles in memory.  My car has 108,000 mile, purchased w/70,000. The resale price took a big hit right after purchase, but appears to have leveled off.  The car has plenty of acceleration for my needs, but slow on the downshift, I average around 24.5 MPG, mostly city freeway. Great vehicle for trips. I need to replace 3 bent rims from the heavily damaged roads of Detroit.  Doors hold water after rain, I cut slits in the lower seals to allow it to escape. Design oversight. Heated and cooled seats are great, air pushed through seat prevent sweating to seat in summer.  Cornering lights work great on dark windy roads. No thought went into design of drink holder.  Handles nicely for a big car.  When manually locking car, it will unlock itself without notice. I've found my car unlocked on too many occasions.

lincoln,mks,2009,Benjamin, 02/25/2019,Mediocre at best,2,"I have the front wheel drive, 20” wheels, sunroof, etc. I bought from an elderly couple with 60k miles. Now it has 80k. The fit and finish is to be desired, with the cloth headliner coming down from around the sunroof. No storage places at all, to include miniature sized cup holders. The passenger seat control panel on side of seat just broke, and now I got YouTube telling me that the motor has a “fatal” flaw of the water pump being buried in the engine.  Costs $2000+ to fix, go figure.

lincoln,mks,2010,turbo_nut, 06/17/2011,New (gently used rather) MKS for Me,4,"Brought home my MKS a couple of weeks ago, and so far have only good things to say.
The car looks great, and is a pleasure to drive.
From the excellent power of the twin turbo v-6 to the well appointed interior, it's just about everything I was looking for in a luxury sedan.
I purchased the Tuxedo Black version, and once I had the windows tinted out, it made the car look complete.
Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.
Just a note, if you're looking for a 'sport' luxury sedan, this isn't the car for you.
If you're after a well appointed cruiser that rides like a dream, then I would suggest checking out the MKS"
lincoln,mks,2010,Great Scotsman, 05/09/2016,Replaced with a 2013 Lincoln MKs,5,"Able to negotiate a great deal on a high mileage 3 year old luxury car with all the options and have enjoyed every moment driving it since. Began with 70,000 miles and have not had a single mechanical, functional or accessory problem.  The twenty inch wheels were a problem when finding winter snow treads - so I bought eighteen inch wheels and new snow/ice tires for winter driving. Car did great in a difficult winter. Engine [V6 ecoboast] has plenty of power when needed, otherwise delivers high mpg [22-27] on road trips. I unqualifiedly recommend searching for this model coming off lease with many miles of future driving pleasure. I bought the 3 year 36,000 miles premium warranty and should have saved my money. Not a single claim or need for it, after 17,000 miles of rigorous country driving.

My last American made car was over 15 years ago, last 4 cars were Acuras: 2 Legends, 1 RL and 1 MDX. I'm enjoying this baby immensely and have never, ever had so many strangers come up to me and tell what a good looking car it is. One common comment:  Lincoln got it right this time. Most amazing to me is the overall mpg of 21.2.  No  trips just around town. Can't wait to take it on a 2,500 trip this summer."

However, in my opinion, the reviews are very short-sighted. First, it is extremely roomy. It is also extremely powerful, and very fast. Best of all, the fuel mileage so far is incredible! In fact, if there is another large, luxury sedan with this kind of performance, that also delivers fuel mileage near 30 MPG on the highway, I've not found it. Best of all, the values on used, low mileage MKS' cannot be beat. This is an excellent value for someone looking for a very nice, high performance, efficient, luxury sedan. "
lincoln,mks,2010,Larry Haley, 01/20/2010,My Lincoln Is Better Than Your Review,5,"All of you Lincoln MKS Nay-Sayers. Immediately retract your statements of discontent.  I recently came off lease of a Mercedes GL 450 and was quite apprehensive about the MKS due to the lack-luster reviews it got from non- consumers who's testomony to Lincoln are memories of their grand parents Continental.  I have the Eco-Boost MKS in candy red and loaded to the tilt with amenities.  The interior spacial accomodations rival that of the; BMW-750, Audi-A8, Lexus-LS460 as well as the S550.  At the cost of the; BMW-5 Series, A6 and or the E-Class.  The only thing that I miss about my Mercedes is the thing that most of you can't see past. A LOGO  MKS VS Genesis: You're Joking Right"
lincoln,mks,2010,brucelinc, 09/28/2009,Torque of the town,5,"The ecoboost engine is awesome - smooth and quiet but deceptively powerful.  I appreciate all the torque at low rpm.  The car moves out strongly without high revs or drama.  The cabin is extremely quiet at all speeds and is very comfortable.  The sync and nav systems are flawless and user friendly.  Although the press has been mostly positive, I think this car is too quickly dismissed by the public due to Lincoln's lack of prestige compared with luxury brands."
lincoln,mks,2010,JDILLA, 02/25/2016,Beautiful Car but get the warranty!,3,"The cars styling is beautiful and it still turns heads and gets compliments. I have a 2010 for the last 3 years with all the bells and whistles you can get. It had around 50K when i got it. For the price and what you get its very nice. I love all the space and the Ecoboost has plenty of getup and go. I don't use the auto park feature very much but it works well. 
Now for the bad. The leather in this car has got to be the worst. I don't put a lot of miles on this car as I slug to work and travel often I would have hoped it would hold up better. I've had infiniti's that wore much better. The gears on the tilting and telescoping steering wheel stripped so I had to get that fixed at about 55k miles. I've had to take it back to the dealer for a transmission leak twice.  First at 68K they said the seals where bad and replaced them. Then again at 78K they said the PTU needed to be replaced. After snow and freezing rain I got in the car and water was pouring in from the lights above the rear view mirror. They said that the drain was clogged causing water back up and enter through these sunroof.  The water leak was not covered and i had to pay 580 bucks to get it fixed. I'm also not a fan of the way water drains through the doors. There are holes covered by a rubber flap under the door. Sometimes they get clogged causing water to build up in the door after a rain storm. You can hear it sloshing around when you drive.  You have to open the door and pull the rubber flap to allow the water to drain. Ford says this is how the designed it but having sitting water in a door I'm sure will lead to rust later.  Also I've had to get the key fob replaced once as it just stopped working.  I'm glad I got the 5 year 100k miles gold warranty on the used car. $100 deductible and they give you a loaner car. I'd suggest you make sure you have the warranty if you buy this car used. I'm going to get rid of this car as soon as the warranty runs out. Too bad because I actually like it a lot. The quality is just lacking.

lincoln,mks,2010,brucelinc, 09/30/2009,Have you driven a Lincoln lately?,5,"The ecoboost MKS is a smooth, quiet very quick mid-luxury sedan that does many things well.  The combination of performance, comfort and techology is impressive.  The Ecoboost engine is a jewel - smooth and quiet yet almost brutally powerful when you want it to be.  The high torque at low RPM makes for drama-free performance with low noise levels and little need for downshifts.  The Sync and Nav systems work flawlessly and are extremely user- friendly.  The adaptive headlights and ambient lighting are nice features, too.  While getting generally good press (except from Edmunds) many people will overlook the MKS because it does not have a ""luxury"" nameplate.  They are overlooking a fine car."

Figured I would save some cash and went to look at the new Taurus, yet was steered to the Lincoln MKS first. I had never researched this or even seen one.  Knowing I needed to trade my ailing S430, I wanted to do something that day.  Even though I was still smitten with the Genesis, it came with no cooling front seats-a must for Arizona summers.  The more I drilled down on the MKS, the more it appealed.  This while not even hearing about Ecoboost which I never saw and feel is overrated/priced.  This 2010 MKS is very very nice and a welcome addition post Mercedes !"
lincoln,mks,2010,MKSistheBEST, 07/30/2010,Love My New MKS,5,"I shopped long and hard; compared Lincoln MKS to MB 350E and Infiniti M37.  350E doesn't have half the bells and whistles and cost at least $6k more.  The Infiniti M's are very impressive with lots of style and bells and whistles--but at $8k more.  You absolutely cannot beat the MKS for the money.  It has every comfort creature I could ask for.  It's got size over the 350E and the Infiniti M.  It has a luxury ride while remaining sporty.  You've got to give this car a serious look before buying.  It can't be beat.  Oh yeah, and regular gas and no maintenance $ to worry about for 3 years!"

I am the type of guy that usually gets 250,000 miles out of a car.  I do expect reasonable maintenance costs to accomplish this goal.  I realize water pumps are something that fail.  It is to be expected.  Usually there are signs to look out for.  This model weeps coolant into the crank case making it very difficult to diagnose a bad water pump.  I would be able to live with that but then I found out most shops will not replace the water pump on these because the engine almost has to come out to get to it under the timing chain cover and the cost by the dealership was over $2200!  I find this unacceptable!  My warning to owners of this car is to unload it before you need this repair.  Mine made it to 164,000 miles.

lincoln,mks,2011,doc81, 03/23/2011,Real Word Review of the 2010 Lincoln MKS,4,"I bought an MKS in December 2010, after three years of exhaustive online comparisons, Edmunds reviews filled with disdain, New England Automobile Shows and test drives.
I was looking for 3 basic criteria in a new car: V-8 power, Rear-Leg
room for my in-laws, and a Large Trunk which would easily fit my golf clubs.
The MKS does all of this in spades!! The leather interior far surpasses
the Ford Taurus.
Only the BMW 760Li, Audi L8 and 2009 Infinity M45 were comparable...for $20-80K more! Overall, the MKS is a spacious full-sized luxury car, that errs on the side of technology rather than interior detail for less than half the cost of a comparable European luxury sedan."

I have owned two Infiniti Q45s, Chrysler 300-C (which was the worst car I have ever owned) and various other cars.
The MKS is very fast, has all the bells and whistles, fun to drive, and also looks fantastic.
Ford has done a terrific job with this one.
I disagree with the testers who complained about the ride I feel it is very good. 
The all wheel drive is fantastic in the snow.
During the snow storms of December 2010 I never got stuck while other cars were abandoned."

It's got plenty of horsepower and will rocket you onto the interstate or around those slow moving vehicles in the left lane. All the while surrounding you in the comfort of heated and cooled, soft leather seats and a surround sound audio system that puts you in the best seat of any venue while cranking out your favorite tunes. Everything sounds good in surround, even the stuff you hate!

I like that Lincoln isn't trying to go Euro luxury with this vehicle. It is a big, well mannered, comfortable highway cruiser that stands out from the rest of the vehicles on the road.

lincoln,mks,2011,Chris, 01/25/2017,Stay Away,2,"I own a 2011 MKS with the 3.5 Ecoboost and this thing will cost you a fortune to own unless you are a mechanic. First off, anyone claiming over 25 MPG is insane unless they only drive downhill. Ecoboost does not stand for efficient. The brakes are underwhelming, and I have never seen a car go through rear brakes so quickly. I have had the brakes changed multiple times, and recently switched to a set of carbon ceramic Powerstop brakes, and are a worthwhile investment if you want them functioning properly on a day to day basis. The motor went in the steering column and the entire thing had to be replaced. The brake booster went out, which is not a huge deal but took a half dozen times in the shop for them to identify. All the while driving garbage ford loaner cars. When someone purchases an MKS, they do not want to be stuck driving a C-max or a fiesta. The timing chain was replaced, which is also a common problem with the 3.5, and a huge reason to stay clear of the F-150's with this engine. other issues: ball joints, control arm, tie rods, rattling speakers, sunroof leaks into the rear door???... the list goes on. Don't get me wrong, this car is amazingly comfortable traveling with my family of four, but please buy a lexus and stay away from  American junk.  Made in Chicago. Built like crap.

It is very nice looking, drives smooth, gets good mileage, is high tech, has nice looking interior and large trunk. Everythink is A-OK except for a fatal flaw.
The huge center console consumes all but a very small part of the center leg room. After driving the car for a short time, we could not get out of it fast enough. Leg cramps are certain to be experienced on a road trip. This is sad for a nice large vehicle like the MKS. What kind of ""designers"" and decision makers does Ford have.

Why pay $90,000+ when you can get all the comfort features for half the price.  Maybe not quit as quiet or positive road handling, but I'm very pleased with comfort and drivability.

lincoln,mks,2013,John Crossley, 08/05/2019,Lots of issues - finally got rid of it.,2,"First off, I wanted to love this car. AWD and a twin turbo v6... seemed like a great combo. I bought mine from a Lincoln dealer as a one owner pre owned. Plenty of power and lots of features but...

In the year and a half I owned it, the following happened.
- Alternator went bad (have fun replacing that on a traverse mounted V6. Lincoln wanted $950)
- FCIM failed (touch controls for audio and air con. Lincoln wanted $750)
- Audio Control Module failed (Lincoln wanted $800)
- Belt tensioner failed ($450 at Lincoln)
- Brakes made a groaning/pulse from Highway speeds (Lincoln replaces rotors and it came back within a month)
- Touch keypad on door never worked
- Sync was buggy and froze often
- The A/C compressor clutch froze (Lincoln wanted $1200)

The final straw was the timing chain began to make noise. At that point, knowing the turbos were only designed to last 10 years/120k... I got rid of it. 

If you’re handy and don’t mind working on your own car it can be reasonable. Just keep in mind there aren’t many write ups online and you’re going to be on your own.

lincoln,mks,2013,Ladi A., 07/26/2018,Sporty looking sedan,4,"Bought my car at 3yrs old. Had it for a little over a year. My 5th Lincoln having gone through 4 Lincoln Town Cars. This car obviously is more sporty and contemporary looking than the LTC whose production was stopped in 2011. The pros of the MKS include the sporty looks. More agile and better braking responsiveness. Looks smaller but quite roomy as large as the Town Car. Taller and so more comfortable sitting position especially at the rear. The panoramic sun/moonroof adds to the luxury package. Handling is quite good especially with the large 19in alloy wheels. Cons: Too much interior noise. The LTC is a lot quieter and more silky ride. No air suspension for the MKS which is a pity. Headlamps malfunction and go out at will and requires a wholesale replacement of the complete assembly. This is weird and unacceptable for a supposed luxury flagship car. Parts are overly expensive. Reliability of this car is horrible compared to its Japanese competition like Toyota Avalon. The jury is still out on the durability of the MKS. The town car has an average of 10yrs and the engine lifespan is within the 400k miles range. Surprised that the MKS was discontinued after only two design models and less than 10yrs on the market. My overall rating is a generous 4 stars.

lincoln,mks,2013,BCO Lincoln Big sedan owner, 02/04/2020,A wonderful sedan that I wish I could buy again,5,"Well designed and built. We need to have more sedans of this size and type made in the USA. The smaller replacement is disappointing and uncomfortable, poorly designed and terrible to travel any distance in. Find an MKS last built in 2016, buy it and keep it as long as possible. I am keeping my 2013 until my long term warranty expires in 2022, unless I find a 2016 to buy sooner.

lincoln,mks,2014,Z Jenkins, 10/23/2015,Better than it is given credit for...,3,"I have a 2014 MKS 3.7 AWD and it is able vehicle that really isn't given the credit it deserves. I will admit that I use the car for business and it works well with clients as far as comfort, but also as far as not being so fancy that it is offensive. I have read numerous reviews about its similarities to the Ford Taurus and while there are similarities (size, weight, overall platform), the minute you get into the driver's seat you will notice that they do not feel THAT similar after all. In terms of the MKS, it has shown itself to be a surprising comfortable and agreeable vehicle after numerous daily commutes and several 4+ hour long car rides with four good size adults. The ride is smooth and quiet, but I will tell you that over choppy pavement the ride could use some additional dampening. The handling of the vehicle is fine, but there is some body roll, although not a huge amount and you generally walk away with a good feeling about the vehicle. I have been your typical import car snob in the past, but I have to give credit where it is due. The MKS is not likely to convert the sport sedan set or those who must have a 'prestige' brand in the driveway, but if you want a good car that is full of noticeably useful features and will leave you feeling comforted, the MKS is worth a look. If Lincoln continues to build on what they have here they will re-establish themselves firmly. The vehicle is not perfect, but it has been trouble free, with good power and good overall comfort. It could use a little leg room everywhere and some hipper styling, but I am perfectly happy with it and I find myself surprised that I am even driving a vehicle like this before I have even hit 40. I'll probably go back to something sportier the next time around, but I do like this car. If Lincoln is smart, they will keep all of this vehicle's finer qualities and package it in a body to grab people in the 35 and older set.

If you have read this review, you should also know that I've since traded the MKS in for a 2016 XTS-a vehicle which smoother, quieter, roomier and more stylish. On first blush, the Lincoln seems okay, but after 125,000 miles the confining interior got to me and so did the slightly odd styling. I thought I liked the car, but after living with the Caddy for the last 24 months I find it difficult to remember liking the Lincoln as much as I seemed to before. Test drive them both before purchasing.

lincoln,mks,2014,Richard Bell, 10/25/2015,"I traded my Mercedes C350 Coupe, 4MATIC, for MKS",4,"The MKS is a fine automobile.  There is absolutely no comparison between the Mercedes Benz and the Lincoln MKS.  The Lincoln MKS wins hands down.  The MKS has real leather, not ""leatherette"" vinyl on the seats as in all C Class Mercedes Benz.  In the MKS, you can actually feel the road, not so in the Mercedes.  The Mercedes is quicker 0-60, but the MKS is heads and shoulders above the Mercedes in every other category.  To me, the ride comfort is far superior to the Mercedes Benz C Class.  The electronics are much more intelligently layed out, and the menu's are logical.  The Mercedes navigation ""Becker Map Pilot"" is the German equivalent of a bad joke.  The Lincoln's premium sound system is just as good as the Harmon Kardon in the Mercedes.  Trunk room in the MKS is fantastic, and the Mercedes trunk room is horrible.  The Lincoln is a few thousand less that the Mercedes, and a much better buy, for the money, the ride, and comfort.

Well, I have now owned this vehicle for over a year, and everything I said above is still true.  I probably shouldn't say this, but this Lincoln MKS easily exceeds 100 mph.  Yes, the Mercedes did too, but the MKS is certainly as stable at speed as the Mercedes was.  The other day,  I loaded 30 pieces of St. Augustine SOD in the trunk, the pieces are about 30"" x 18"", and the guy said they would never fit in the trunk ....until I open it...they fit just fine.  I still like this car, it is comfortable on trips, and nimble enough to drive comfortably in heavy traffic.  If Lincoln hadn't discontinued the MKS model, they would have sold several million if they only produced it in a convertible model.

I am rapidly approaching two years of ownership and near 30,000 miles on the odometer and this MKS has not skipped a beat.  Everything is holding up well, and no visits required for maintenance.  Wash and wax, change the oil at regular intervals, and the car still looks great.  The new Lincoln's look good, but I'm not ready to trade yet.  My vehicle is now 6 model years old, coming up on 36,000 miles, and not one problem experienced with this vehicle.  What absolutely
blows my mind is that it only has a trade-in value around $10,000.00 bucks.  Who is it that gave this car a bad rap?  It's as good, if not better than the Mercedes's it replaced.

I  was looking forward to front wheel drive since i live on a long upward sloping drive.  This car has great traction and I want comfort.  This car is great in both areas.  The car is quiet. There was one recall  which the dealer took care of nicely.  I love to drive this car.

The infotainment is slow but who cares. The controller for the hvac and radio volume went out. Part was discontinued but got a used one and haven't had a problem since. The car is inexpensive to maintain rides wonderful and outside of regular maintenance costs less then a corolla to maintain. That 100. Ford did this right. A guy on here said he had one and bought a Cadillac and forgot why he liked the MKS. These and short term owners that don't hold on to cars long. Mine tho I look at it drive it and love it. My car is happy. My wallet is happy and seeing these for sale all over with 300k miles plus and still going gives me hope that Lincoln is still Lincoln.

lincoln,mks,2015,HoJo, 11/11/2017,Will be tough to give up when lease is up,5,"My MKS is a 3 year leased vehicle and I have a little less than a year left on the lease.  This is the first car I've ever had that has just about every option available, including massaging seats, but I don't use half of the things.  I am truly interested in trying out a Continental, so I guess it will depend on the deal they are will to work, as my residual at the end of the lease is highly reasonable.  I am really torn about what I'm going to do.  The brakes are very touchy on this car, and every once in a while there is a bogging when I hit the gas.  I am a fast driver, not a typical MKS driver, so I do put the pedal down.  My other car is a Mustang GT, and that car flies. I really do love this car a lot, but after 36 years in the military, and pretty much kept cars for 200,000+ miles, I feel I've reached a point where I want to spoil myself a bit.  Did I mention that I love this car?  Because I do.

lincoln,mks,2015,Lincoln MKS Owner, 12/08/2015,Great car,5,"Having owned a 2009 Lincoln Town Car in the past, the 2015 MKS is just as good or better in ride and quality. The seats are actually more comfortable than the Town Car. On trips, the adaptive cruise control is a very impressive feature when approaching slower cars in front of you. Their is plenty of power when passing with the 3.7 engine. Some individuals find the SYNC with MyLincoln Touch difficult to use, but once you get the basics down, it's rather easy to use including navigation. So far we are very impressed with this vehicle and look forward to trips this coming year.

lincoln,mks,2015,Car Flipper, 07/10/2018,Buy for reliability,4,"The car has no issues, its engine is used in taxicabs and police intercepters for a reason, with pull so hard you’d feel you could leave the eatth’s crust going off the line; that and its massive trunk are the three major selling points of this car.    Other cars offer all the same features, some better implemented. The interior is very bland, handling (well this is a given) is very mushy, the transmission is never in the right gear always being several too low as well as very jerky, and engine sound is horrible; shifting up for yourself (which I have to do every time I drive the car) takes you away from the left hand dashboard screen where it keeps information such as fuel economy (using graphics that aren’t very good, and with awkwardly sized gauges especially for the tach). Visibility is very limited which forces a high seating position, small touches such as the missing wiper stock on the righthand side and the poor allignment of the woodpanels on the door and dash or the plastics on the center console drive me INSANE. I’m very attentive to details, for this reason the car doesn’t suit me by any means. It’s definitely designed for those who like SUV seating position, and enjoy having full power a half inch down on the throttle.

Other than that it’s been perfect. Has plenty of space and I was particularly surprised with the amount of power that this car has regardless of how big and heavy the car is. Great ride quality too // p.s. it’s so quiet and smooth you can barely tell how fast you’re going at highway speeds sometimes.

lincoln,mks,2016,Carlos Chandler, 09/20/2016,MKS is a hidden gem!,5,"I was looking for something roomy, with a powerful engine (v6 or v8), a silky smooth ride, and all bells and whistles.  So so glad I test drove the MKS in my car search.  The press bashed this car for being too similar to the Ford Tuarus, but to me that's never been a consistently applied criticism, as journalists rate the Lexus ES 350 as a better car (it isn't) letting it off the hook despite being a glorified Toyota Avalon.  The engine is from the SHO and it is bad ass.  350 ft lbs of torque that you feel the minute you push the pedal.  In comfort mode it's like driving a modern reincarnation of the Town Car.  In sport mode it's a large all wheel drive sports sedan.   You can hear yourself breath it's so quite in the cabin and the leather is butter smooth.  Just love it.  Massaging seats, adjustable gas/break pedals, and dual moon roofs this car is first class.

The outside presents a nice clean and smooth look. The one I drive is in black so it looks as good as any other black car on the road during the night time. My favorite part of this car is the tail lights. Its not like the protypical tail lights on cars. The Long straight bar lights look great and can you can easily tell this car apart even from the sister MKT from the rear. The car offeres decent performance. Isnt the most fuel efficient car by far but is solid. At $2.75 a galllon your looking at a $50 fillup at the pump. Good Pick. Just take car of her!"

The firemen at the scene said that my MKX saved our lives and for the severity of the accident, the car took an amazing impact and stayed intact.

My interior drivers side light went out and I took that to the dealer to be fixed. They said that a connector was loose and that they fixed the problem. Now, a couple of weeks later, the interior drivers side light is out again and I have to take it back to the dealer.

Love the ride. I have 43,000 miles. I like the way the car looks too.  I like the warranty that comes with the vehicle."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Ceysw, 02/25/2008,Great Car/SUV,5,"I have driven this suv since Sept. Very comfortable, handles great. Fun to drive, and worth the money."
lincoln,mkx,2007,bashmyshell, 04/08/2007,Makes H3 look like a Prius,3,"I admit, I purchased this car expecting at least 17/22 MPG based on the listed 19/25 sticker. After casually driving for 200 miles, I have noticed one thing. This car has never gotten higher than 11.8 MPG.  And this was after I decided to drive like a grandma.  Mileage is more like 10/11 after 2000 miles.  very disappointed!  90% of my driving is on the freeway with no traffic!  But it definately is comfortable and plush while draining the gas down. I would have never made the purchase had I known the mileage was so low."
lincoln,mkx,2007,jerseygirl, 04/22/2007,Love my Lincoln MKX,5,"Had my heart set on a Ford Edge until I drove the Lincoln! The handling is much smoother, and the overall quality is a step higher than the Edge. I'm glad I spent the extra money and bought the Lincoln. Now getting stuck in traffic doesn't bother me!"
lincoln,mkx,2007,Southern girl, 05/04/2007,Downsize,4,"From a Navigator to MKX, sizable change, but so far great CUV! Hoping for better gas mileage than I've gotten so far. Lincoln could make a go cart and I would buy it. Enough about the grille, I like it better than the Ford Edge. Interior could have a little less plastic and more bling! Wish the tailgate window opened."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Richard, 05/02/2007,Better than I expected,4,"Definite head turner. Gas mileage isn't great, but filling with regular is better than supreme. Interior instruments are very user friendly. Brakes are a little soft. Very smooth ride.  Everyone who sits in the back seats have plenty of room and love the vista roof.  Lots of extras like heated and cooled front seats, reclining back seats with one touch fold down, auto liftgate and rear sensors make this a great deal."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Allen, 05/26/2007,Refreshing American X-Over,4,The vehicle has more room for 2nd row passengers than my Navigator. Very comfortable on long trips. Great radio and nav system. And descent fuel economy for the vehichle size.
lincoln,mkx,2007,LJ, 06/09/2007,MKX Owner,4,"Haven't had it long but love the way it drives. One thing they need to replace in a hurry are the front seats. Starting with mine. The drivers seat as well as the passenger's is tipped up where your back of your knee is. By 45 minutes in driving your legs tingle then go to sleep. Not good! There should be a movement as such, designed in the lever so you can tip it down. "
lincoln,mkx,2007,NYCdriver, 07/15/2007,Head turner,4,This is a great vehicle with a quiet fast engine. Lincoln once again delivers its signature smooth ride. I realized that speeding is becoming a habit when I'm behind the wheel. Not feeling how fast I'm trvaeling. You would not believe how many looks this SUV gets. My passengers notice it as well.   
lincoln,mkx,2007,jak51, 06/19/2007,So far so good on my first Lincoln,4,Ride is very smooth and engine is very quiet at idle. Transmission shifts are barely noticeable. Interior still has some items that look like cheap plastic and don't fit very well. I will have them replaced. 
lincoln,mkx,2007,BrettMan, 06/30/2007,Better Than What Some Magazines Have Said,4,"If you like the styling, then you will enjoy the MKX. It handles well for a larger SUV, is very comfortable, and offers a ton of features."
lincoln,mkx,2007,CocoaOwner, 08/25/2007,"6,000 miles and zero defects",4,"I've driven my MKX 6,000 miles -- about half and half road trips and in-town. In-town handling is just outstanding, comfort is fine (I need to get some window tinting done, though).  While I prefer the sofa-style comfort of a Town Car for long trips, I was very pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the MKX turned out to be on a long trip -- I'm 6'2"" and hefty and still there was very adequate room and comfort. There has not been one thing wrong with the vehicle -- fit and finish are great.  I added correct-color side ding protection strips and a Weathertech cargo mat.  Though it's no muscle car, both acceleration and braking exceeded my expectations."
lincoln,mkx,2007,ketabors, 11/08/2007,Back to American Built,4,"I have driven foreign cars for the past 10 years. After searching extensively, the MKX blew the overpriced foreign SUVs out of the water. The ride is better than the BMW I recently turned back in. It is very spacious with plenty of front leg room. The sound system is the best I have ever heard in an automobile. I have nothing but great praise for this sleek auto. "
lincoln,mkx,2007,Diana, 03/08/2008,Now it's the transmission!,3,"Factory ordered. Passenger door air noise and rattle fixed and defective molding on interior fixed. Air conditioner hose soaked driver floor. 16,000 miles later, rear tailgate stopped opening automatically one day. Transmission slipping now at 17,000 miles. From day one, on an incline and going slow while turning steering box noise but Lincoln found ""nothing unusual"". MPG hwy. 21.7, city 19"
lincoln,mkx,2007,Buyer Beware, 04/23/2008,Buyer Beware,1,"We were stupid when we traded in our 2005 Toyota Sequoia for this car. We wanted to get better gas mileage which it seems like it is getting about 2 to 3 mpg better. Seats are hard and very uncomfortable. If you are over 5'10"" be sure to check out the leg room on both the passenger side as well as the drives side. My wife doesn't like the idea of not having a handle on the passenger side to assist her getting out of the car. I wouldn't buy this car again."
lincoln,mkx,2007,George37, 09/28/2015,Jorge37,5,"The best car !!!!
"
lincoln,mkx,2007,Sorry, 05/14/2008,Wish I had looked closer,1,"Had a Toyota Sequoia which I wish i had back. When you buy this car make sure you are a short person as your knees will reach the dash board if you are over 5 11. Can't say the gas mileage has been great, but a little better than the Sequoia. Seats are hard."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Will, 03/28/2009,"Poor Gas Mileage, Mechanical problems",2,Got the car and the electrical system had to be replaced.  Keep getting banging noise when accelerating but they cant find the reason.  Fuel filter overloaded already.  Gets at best 14 MPG.  Very comfortable inside and love the features but would not look at this again
lincoln,mkx,2007,rlwillia, 07/07/2008,Great Vehicle!,4,"Leased my MKX in March of 2007. After 16,500 miles and three long road trips of 1400 miles round trip and driving back and forth to work every day, this is an outstanding vehicle. No maintenance issues, reasonable gas mileage for an SUV, great features and very comfortable interior, seats, and drive feel."
lincoln,mkx,2007,bacdoc, 02/07/2009,love the ride,4,"We have owned this vehicle 1 yr. with 10000 mi. on it. So far it has been very reliable, excellant in the snow with the stock all seasons. Seats are firm but very supportive. One trip of 2000 mi avg 25 mpg however driving lots of hills where we live is only 14- 15 mpg. Probably the nicest highway car we have owned, smooth, quiet and handles well."
lincoln,mkx,2007,New to Lincoln, 04/30/2009,Nice little UCV/SUV,4,"Im not big on American cars but I had this car for about 5 months now and I can say I get alot of enjoyment out of it. Its the base model and the only thing I dislike is the gas mileage. Its only an expensive ford edge so if you want something a little less expensive go with the edge. The interior is great though. Love the layout of the dash. Front headroom is a little limiting but not a big deal. Fun to drive, has great pick up, sound system great, and TONS of front passenger storage. Takes regualr gas and performs excellent"
lincoln,mkx,2007,Anthony A. Heying, 01/14/2008,My first Lincoln,4,"I have had 29 mpg highway according to the meter in the vehicle. 18.7 around town, not bad for a vehicle its size.  I like the stiffer suspension and firm seating. The vehicle has performed well and i'm happy although it is a more expensive Edge.  I'd recommend to a potential ""crossover"" buyer.  "
lincoln,mkx,2007,Barbara M Davidson, 03/13/2010,"My ""New"" used Car",5,"I have had this car a little over 2 months now & I love it.  I have always wanted a ""luxury Car"" and now I have one.  I like all of the features that Is has included in it.  It is comfortable to drive, quite roomy inside and handles well on the road. I have gotten up to 24 mpg on the open road and 19 - 20 mpg around town, so far."
lincoln,mkx,2007,KaySW, 02/17/2008,No Problems,5,"Love this crossover. I had a Ford Explorer before this and I liked it also. Great trim and detail, love the seating, very comfortable, the A/C and heating the leather are great. "
lincoln,mkx,2007,Likeitalot, 01/29/2007,It makes people look,4,"The MKX drives very smoothly and quietly.  We love the roof open, even for the back seat.  It comfortably fits 3 in the back.  The only question is gas mileage.  It is too soon to tell.  The first tank was regular only 14.8 mpg.  Now we are trying mid grade to see if we get better mileage.  Everybody comments how ""foreign looking"" and beautiful it is.  We paid for the white chocolate, and it is beautiful with real light wood interior.  Wish they had XM radio instead of Sirius however.  I will not renew the Sirius contract and have XM in my Acura and in the home.  They should offer an alternative.  "
lincoln,mkx,2007,Frank, 02/03/2007,A Winner,5,"This car is great.  One month later, I like it more and more.  The seats and interior were better than the Mercedes M.  A strong V-6, and lots of toys.  The MKX is the perfect size inside and out.  This is the second car I've had with the a/c seats and if you live in the south, the cooled seats are worth getting."
lincoln,mkx,2007,pcohenchicago, 03/01/2007,"Yah, this car is cool too",4,"Over the past couple of years I have owned an Acura MDZ, Nissan Maxima, Acura RL (2006), Acura TL, Dodge Charger SRT8, Toyota Avalon, Ford Explorer, and a Jeep Wrangler.  I've test driven MANY more.  Why so many?  I just couldn't find the vehicle that suited all of my needs.  Along comes the Lincoln MKX.  The styling won me over and driving it was icing on the cake.  Well thought out design and all the creature comforts to make this a great road-trip machine.  I got mine fully loaded with the Pan roof and THX yadda yadda.  Loveing-it so far.  At 35, I feel this car fits me perfectly."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Nice Car..I Mean SUV, 03/19/2007,MKX Arrives w/Style!,4,"Nice car. Lincoln did a nice job with the overall design. Could have used a glove box light and covers for the seat wiring. Car broke down on first trip. Gas meter stopped working. Rear taillight was scratched from factory. Nice design, beautiful car but Lincoln quality assurance needs refinement! The GPS navigation is anything but intelligent often selecting the most indirect route. Software needs to be re-engineered!"
lincoln,mkx,2007,Unhappy, 04/09/2007,Disappointed,4,It is more like driving a car than a SUV. The ride is rough and the gas mileage is not up to what Lincoln indicates that it will be. It doesn't have the usual Lincoln qualities. This vehicle is identical to the Ford Edge except for a few cosmetics.
lincoln,mkx,2007,Carl, 04/28/2007,Love It,4,"My wife and I both love to drive it especialy in the N.C. Mountains. We have 10,000 plus on it. So far about 21 MPG. A little noisy on rough road. Plenty of pep on interstate.   "
lincoln,mkx,2007,BrendaBoo, 04/30/2007,Quality Ride,4,I absolutley love my new MKX. I have had it now for three months and have taken a couple of road trips in it.  The ride is wonderful and the steering is nice and tight.  I feel very safe in my MKX and I love how the seats feel like they cup your back.  I had a Chrysler 300M previously and I like the fact that I ride higher in my MKX. I just feel like I made the right choice in my new car purchase. The Interior is beautiful and I really have no complaints except that living in Florida the front windows and windshield allowed too much sun in. I had them darkened and now it's perfect!
lincoln,mkx,2007,LAB, 05/06/2007,Love Every Minute,4,"After looking at many vehicles I decided on the MKX and have not been disappointed. I have every option available. Ride is great, and gas mileage is what I expected. After almost 2 months I average about 19 in town and most of my drive is surface. Highway has been around 26. Not being an AWD makes a difference in mileage. You can ask for a better buy price wise. "
lincoln,mkx,2007,Painterguy, 04/28/2007,Nice Car,4,Had my MKX about a month now. So far no problems. Averaging 16.6 mpg city driving. Haven't had it on a trip yet. Car gets lot of attention. People ask questions about it. Traded in a Volvo V-70 wagon for it. The MKX is better in most ways except seat comfort and mpg. Back seats are more comfortable than front. Can't beat those Volvo seats. I like the looks in and out.  Handles well and rides much better than the Volvo. Very quiet.  Hard to tell if the engine is running. Enough power for my needs. Lots of room with the back seat down for hauling stuff.  Overall a very nice car. Hope it holds it's value well.
lincoln,mkx,2007,bailey, 05/11/2007,My raod trip,5,Went for a road trip from Vegas to Scottsdale. Car handled great and was comfortable. No wind noise. Very pleased.
lincoln,mkx,2007,Phil, 06/11/2007,Very Impressed!,4,"I drove them all BMW X3, Caddy SRX, Infiniti FX35, Lexus RX350 and Volvo XC90 but drove the Lincoln home.  Great car with the perfect blend of style, luxury, performance and comfort.  I did not think Lincoln could build a vehicle that competed with the vehicles I tested but this one exceeds all. It's a winner."
lincoln,mkx,2007,linc lover, 06/06/2007,Great Crossover in AWD,4,I love that it takes regular gas instead of premium and it has a lot of power. My regular mileage is 17mpg in city conditions. It is like a sports car and the open top is awesome!
lincoln,mkx,2007,Issac Szlamkowicz, 06/18/2007,My review,5,Handling on the road is very good. Acceleration is more than adequate. I enjoy the vista roof and the cooled seats. Lincoln did this one right. It was worth the wait.
lincoln,mkx,2007,ts, 07/17/2007,Impressed,5,"This car has been fun to drive. Good gas mileage 26 hwy, 19 city.  nterior is very nice, smooth ride, and plenty of power. The radio is awesome and easy to use. The folding seats and rear trunk release are very easy to use. The adaptive head lights work really well. Dual AC works well"
lincoln,mkx,2007,car lover, 08/21/2007,Lincoln MKX,5,Very nice driving and styling.  More road noise than I expected but not bad.  Had 2004 Toyota Highlander prior but we both like this one better. Mileage is 20 mpg and 25 mpg on open road.
lincoln,mkx,2007,John, 09/06/2007,Good Vehicle,4,"I Looked at Infinity and BMW and Lexus. When I tested the Lincoln, It was as good as the rest with more room and it uses regular gas. It suffers from a little road noise on some surfaces but over all it is very quiet and a good ride. I have over 3000 miles and so far so good. No problems. Gas milage has been 23.5 best on the interstate and around 20 average but I'm a little heavey footed. I like the performance and braking. It gets a lot of comments from passers by."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Rick Andrewartha, 05/30/2007,Great car so far,5,"This car seems to be built with great quality and care. We have been driving Town cars for the last few years. The ride of the MKX is sure not in the same class, but has a great ride of its own. My wife is the primary driver and she just loves this car. "
lincoln,mkx,2007,First Lincoln, 07/04/2007,Almost Got It Right,4,"We have just about put 10,000 miles on our MKX and overall I am pleased with our choice. It was a toss-up between the Caddy SRX and the Lincoln. My wife liked the visibility out of the Lincoln better so we went with it. The MKX interior is not as refined as the Caddy and the exterior design is pretty generic, except for that beautiful front grille.  Would like to see softer seats and more leather inside and a bit more classic lines outside. Fuel mileage has been less than I had hoped for, the best I have gotten on the highway is 22.9.  That was over the course of a 2-day 700 mile trip."
lincoln,mkx,2007,David, 07/06/2007,Best bang for buck,4,"I looked at all the SUV crossovers and I think that this is the best mid sized SUV. The brakes are good, fuel economy could be better but the engine is not broken in yet. I think Ford has a winner, but they need to educate their dealerships about the car. Not up to BMW or Lexus standards, which I also own.  "
lincoln,mkx,2007,Greg Arserio, 08/20/2007,A Lincoln for the Younger Crowd,4,"A Lincoln... at 32 years old! I thought I'd be 30 years older before buying a Lincoln, but when shopping for a Ford Edge, the decision was simple. If you are in the market for a fully equipped Edge, just go with the MKX instead. This is a beautiful ride with everything you could want. Very quiet, smooth and competent in all kinds of weather conditions. Great leg room in all seating positions... and this is coming from a 6'1"" guy. Also, from a maintenance standpoint, Ford finally got the oil filter location right. It's in plain view, centered, plenty of room to unscrew it and place a drip pan underneath and nothing in the way as it drips dry. But wait, do Lincoln owners actually change oil?"
lincoln,mkx,2007,gardnpc, 09/15/2007,She Made the Choice,4,"My wife did all the research and selected this over the Mazda CX-9 and Highlander. It's her car! We got the Creme' Brulee with Camel interior and she just loves it. The sticker was just over $39,000 and we did the deal for $35,000 even. We went to dealer equipped with the Edmunds TMV analysis and it saved us quite a bit of haggling. We drove the Edge as well, but the Lincoln suspension and interior quality is a big upgrade.  Doesn't feel like the same vehicle. We really like the Vista roof and heated/cooled seats. She thinks it's nearly like a convertible. Reliability has been excellent. We like the fact it burns regular gas.  All in all, a very nice package.  "
lincoln,mkx,2007,jon ollie, 09/28/2007,Great so far,4,"I just got my MKX. I love it so far. It rides smooth, good power.  Sometimes it surprises me with the acceleration. I traded in my Mountaineer and I don't feel I gave up any room or space.  I'm getting a lot of looks on the street!  The base model has everything you need.  I sprung for the vista roof.  If you want the nav system or the THX sound system about $5000 more.  "
lincoln,mkx,2007,anthony heying, 10/09/2007,"Very nice, roomy, quiet , well appointed",4,I have owned SUVs in the past but this one is so very nice with its features and it's fairly good on fuel.
lincoln,mkx,2007,Trey, 05/25/2007,"Fun and Safe, Loving it!",5,"The MKX has been very fun to drive and very safe. We have a child on the way and we are the 5-star crash rating was a must. It's very quiet even on the highway at 70 and it goes over bumps in the road like they don't exist, and trust me, there are lots of them here in the midwest."
lincoln,mkx,2007,floridasand, 06/07/2007,Love the MKX,5,We enjoy driving our MKX and plan to take it on a trip soon.  Handles well. We had pin stripes put on and added color-coded side bumper guards. Weathertech cargo mat fits perfectly. 
lincoln,mkx,2007,Shelly, 06/20/2007,My Baby of a Lincoln,4,"I had my mind set on the ML350 but went for the MKX after my first test drive. I am a commuter so I had to treat myself to something comfortable and classy to keep me sane. MKX fit the bill. Simply put, I love the car. Just a couple of improvements I'd like to see."
lincoln,mkx,2007,silver markx, 07/20/2007,mkx rocks,4,Love this car!  I have had it since April and took it on a 1000 mile roadtrip.  Excellent in every way. 
lincoln,mkx,2007,Ranko, 09/09/2007,MKX love it,4,Wanted this vehicle from the first time that I saw it and had it delivered in May.  I commute 180 miles a day and it has been a pleasure to drive. Great mileage for a SUV and I get tons of admiring looks from other drivers and pedestrians.  
lincoln,mkx,2007,Lincoln Man, 09/16/2007,This is the one!,5,"I had a 2006 Mountaineer Premier, and was not in the market. I on a whim drove the MKX and owned one days later. This is the coolest ride ever, fast, smooth, and this thing does everything but brush my teeth. well equipt. All I can say is take one for a ride you will be in heaven on wheels. I am 6'2"" guy and have plenty of room, sound system is very nice, and the Nav."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Carmella Wade, 10/15/2007,Lovin The Ride,4,"I purchased this vehicle back in August, and I am loving the ride.  This vehicle is very smooth.  I did not get the Navigation system or the vista roof.  I have the DVD player. We put a DVD in and turned up the sound. You would think you were in a theater with popcorn. The system is nice. Also, this vehicle moves when you need to get moving. I really enjoy my MKX and would not trade it for the world.  "
lincoln,mkx,2007,Okie, 04/04/2008,A Lincoln For Me,4,"After visiting too many dealers that wanted to put me in a car I did not want, I finally found one that showed me the right car.  I've been a Ford pickup owner for decades, but this time I wanted a little better ride and comfort (with a 6 cyl auto). I did not like the ride in my son in law's X3 and could not believe how tacky most of the GM crossovers were.  It came down to the Enclave and the MKX, and the deals on MKXs coming off one- year leases made the financial decision pretty easy. I did not want:  vista roof, thx, navigation. Dealer got me what I wanted at the price I had researched.  So far, so good at 11,300 miles."
lincoln,mkx,2007,Jack M, 08/25/2020,Best in Class,5,"Wish I had never gotten rid of my 2007 MKX. Had great power, neat interior, excellent cooled front seats, decent gas mileage, well-planned dashboard, easy to handle. Would love to have it back.

lincoln,mkx,2008,tx1949, 04/30/2010,best suv/crossover I could find,4,"I looked at a lot of SUV and crossovers and I liked the MKX best. The combo of style, performance, and features made it easy to ""buy American."" I like how it drives; more of a sedan feel rather than a truck- like drive.  Cooled seats in Texas set it apart from all the others.  I really like the Ipod hookup, satellite radio, nav system, and hands free phone functions.  And they are all integrated & work perfectly.  I averaged 19 mpg for the 36k miles I had it; and the 6 cyl had plenty of zip.  Only negative is that the battery died after 2 years but the quick response I got from the dealer made up for even that one negative. I am spoiled and will not go back to a lesser vehicle. "
lincoln,mkx,2008,dontblink, 08/06/2014,Top Notch,4,"After several horrible experiences with European vehicles, I decided to buy domestic again. I dig the clean crisp styling, strong stance, & front grill reminiscent of Lincoln's past. The ride is firm yet comfortable, it handles well, & mileage is decent. The sound system is great. The clutter free instrumentation with retro gauges is pleasing.
The cabin is roomy with plenty of cargo space. Quality leather seats are comfortable. Fit & finish is top notch inside & out. It could benefit from a rear view backup camera. The silver painted interior plastic looks like silver painted plastic. I really like the MKX, it is safe, stylish, reliable, & comfortable. It will likely be a favorite of ours. "
lincoln,mkx,2008,Been a great ride, 10/01/2017,Been a great ride,5,"Bought this new and thought I’d get tired of it early on. Have driven this car across country many times, and have grown to love it. Would definitely buy another one,  but I think I’m going to keep this one for a few more years. It’s that good!!! Finally retired the old girl, but it’s still on the road
"
lincoln,mkx,2008,Pete, 11/22/2016,The perfect small SUV,5,"I'm a coupe kind of guy. I like to be low to the ground and have a grip of where all my tires are. The idea of an SUV has never really intrigued me... that is until I test drove the MKX. It was small enough that I felt like I still had control of it and large enough to handle any extra storage we may need. I loved the black interior with natural-colored wood grain trim. It's the perfect combination in my opinion. On top of the black exterior. For an '08 the features are pretty outstanding. The white dash lights are very nice as opposed to the green or amber I've been so accustomed to. The ride is very comfortable and the cooled/heated seats make it even more comfortable. The interior lighting is bright, but it's not annoying to the driver. The only thing we had come up with it is the speed sensor went out 1500 miles after owning it. Fortunately, the dealer put a 3000-mile warranty on it, pretty surprising for an 8-year-old vehicle, and it was covered. Otherwise, it was about an $800 expense. Regardless, I love this SUV. I'm very glad we held out and went with Lincoln. Even though I'm a Toyota guy, I have always liked Ford, and I figured Lincoln was the way to go if I wanted all the features.

UPDATE 5/23/19
Still loving this vehicle. The leather has held up very nicely. It still drives great. Other than the speed sensor issue in my initial review, it’s only been in the shop for oil, tires, and a tune-up. We did have to replace the brakes 6 months ago, but that’s it. We’ve put 40k miles on it since my initial review above. 

I only have one complaint... sometimes if the Bluetooth won't connect to my phone, I have to turn the car off and back on to get it connected. I wonder if this is a Lincoln and/or Ford thing because my 2011 Lincoln MKZ does the same thing. That’s it for a complaint.

I’m really liking the drive of Lincoln and hope that it remains reliable because I could see us being a life long Lincoln family.

UPDATE 11/24/20
Being a 12, nearly 13 year old vehicle at this point, we've actually received compliments on having a nice car. I do keep it clean and properly take care of its appearance. I'm still very happy with this vehicle. 
"
lincoln,mkx,2008,shellygg, 08/01/2018,Good size; comfortable ride,4,"Liked that this is a crossover so you sit up a higher than a car but it is not a huge step up to get in. Comfortable ride that handles well in ice and snow. Not very good gas mileage, but I expected that. Heated driver's seat stopped functioning about 6 months after 4-year warranty ran out and would have been very expensive to repair. Voice recognition of synced phone was spotty across multiple phones that I had over the years and it sometimes lost my phone-book.

lincoln,mkx,2008,Joy, 09/13/2015,Could've had a V8!!!!,1,"I bought it used. Beautiful vehicle. Took it home decided to give it a a good wax job and to my surprise the rust was eating it up. I took it back to the dealership for help with this. Nothing, it has 54,000 miles on it and they told me to contact Lincoln. No help there either. About a year later, I receive safety recalls, rust corrosion because the 2008 was not sealed properly.  So check your gas tank straps and cooling system for excessive corrosion. Took it for inspection, even the covering on my shocks are ate off by rust. The entire frame is extensively rusted. Lincoln said to have it inspected. I did. Yes it's extensive Ms dumbass for buying this vehicle, but no safety issues so nothing will be done. I call bullshit!!  This vehicle has been nothing but a money pit. BEWARE!! I will never buy another FORD product.

lincoln,mkx,2008,Vince, 04/14/2018,The Year Report,4,"I bought this car a little later in its life, got it used in 2017 with 58,000 miles on it. Man, it’s still in the race though with luxury cars that have came out years ahead and even in to now. I think the vehicle even in 2018 looks very stylish and up to date, the features it has are also still very current and practical. The sync system works well even with my iPhone 8 and the navigation system has always been able to direct me to any place I needed to go. I feel like Lincoln as a brand has gotten a lot of negative attention in terms of not being a “real” luxury brand. Honestly I feel like this vehicle was miles ahead of any Cadillac that came out in 2008 or even in to today. The only feature I wish I had was a reverse camera but the parking sensors help out nicely. I have about 69,000 miles on it now and have had no problems at all. I think this car is for sure one that is worth a look, especially pre-owned.

lincoln,mkx,2008,Burton Pryor, 07/07/2017,Enjoy driving again,4,"Purchased an used 08 Mkx  after letting go My town car which makes this my third Lincoln product.  I love the styling  both inside and out it has a very nice appearance.  The car is smooth and quiet, has a great ride, handles well at high and low speed's .  The versatility of this vehicle allows me to do whatever I need from going out on the town in style or towing and  moving items in the large interior space .  I enjoy the simplicity of the interiors dash uncluttered look.  The rear seats that recline or a nice option for passengers. The Vesta sunroof is a wonderful option when driving gives you a very comfortable open air feel to the cabin from front to back .  The car allows you to make Road trips drive for 12 to 14 hours and not feel cramped and uncomfortable .  The car feels heavy and substantial in highway driving sticks to the road makes you feel in control of what you were doing. I love this vehicle and would buy it again.

lincoln,mkx,2008,MKXLuva, 07/10/2009,Dream SUB,4,"I been eyeing this SUB since it came out! It took me 8 months to convince my hubby to buy me this car. We bought the 2008 Limited Edition with the 20"" wheels. I LOVE LOVE this car! It's an eye candy! Lots and lots of compliments! Lots and Lots of look! We test drove a Benz, Lexus 350 and Acura and it's uncomparable! I probably will drive this car for the next yearS to come!"
lincoln,mkx,2008,Tamralynn, 08/23/2009,LOVE LOVE LOVE this car,5,I have now had my MKX for 1.25 years.  I cannot say enough great things about it.  The creme brulee color and the light tan interior still look brand new.  I love all the features can't say enough about the sync (makes me lazy).  I have numerous people try to buy it from me.  This is the most luxurious sexy fun car I have ever owned.  My 12 year old and his friends LOVE the rockin' steroe system.  I can't believe it is stock.  My gas mileage continues to improve with each oil change.  I am now getting 24 hwy and 10 city.  Would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.
lincoln,mkx,2008,Ecoboost, 01/29/2010,Fun car to own,4,"Terrific car to own and drive.  21,000 miles and getting 17+ around town 24 on the highway.  Great in snow and ice and on trips.  We take 700 mile trips frequently and always enjoy the ride.  Only negative is the hard seat cushions.  Handling is good, mileage better than expected and overall performance excellent.  Dealer experience is excellent.  They went out of their way to satisfy me with the PTU problem and fixed it when other dealers were having difficulty."
lincoln,mkx,2008,John, 02/09/2018,Takata Airbag recall.,1,"Back in July 2016 I received a recall notice for my 2008 Lincoln MKX regarding a Takata airbag issue. The recall notice indicated this issue could result in death and/or great bodily harm or serious injury. For a year and a half I've been trying to get this issue addressed with negative results with my local Lincoln dealership (Island Lincoln), finally prompting me to contact Lincoln corporate in Dearborn, Michigan. So I wrote to Lincoln's CEO expressing my concern for this recall, the possibility of death or serious harm per the recall notice, my continued email correspondence with my local Lincoln dealership, and seeking some type of assurance regarding this issue.

What I received was a response from Lincoln advising me not to use the front passenger seat of my vehicle to preclude any issue. Mind you I've been using the front seat of my Lincoln MKX for the past year and a half, where my wife sits, and this is the first time I've been informed not to use the front passenger seat of my own automobile. In addition, the recall notice says nothing about not using the front passenger seat and Lincoln's website indicates the issue of the airbag isn't a safety issue and can be used safely until repaired. So which is it? If my wife and I go out to eat with another couple, does she have to squeeze into the back seat with the other couple for safety reasons, as per Lincoln and I drive by myself, or can she ride up front in safety according to Lincoln's website? Is Lincoln lying or misleading?  This June is 2 years waiting.  Beware this vehicle and recall.  Injuries from exploding Takata airbags can be downright gruesome.
Police responding to the scene of a minor car accident in California believed the driver had been shot in the face. At another crash site in Georgia, police thought the female driver was a murder victim because of the wounds on her throat. In both cases, the drivers died. The cause of their injuries: a Takata airbag.  The recall notice says nothing about not using the front passenger seat.  However, Lincoln wrote me not to use it!  Beware!!

Ford provided me a rental vehicle that I've been using the past 6 months, a 2017 Ford Escape, at no charge.  It's now August 2018 and the recall notice I received on my Lincoln MKX was July 2016.  That's two years running!!  Ford had me sign some affidavit that I wouldn't use, or allow to be used by anyone else, my Lincoln MKX.  Now my Lincoln MKX sits parked in my condo parking lot for 6 months straight, unable to be used or driven, in a harsh salt water environment on the ocean.  The worst thing you can do is allow a vehicle to sit long term without being used.  

The Ford Escape is an okay car but it's no Lincoln MKX in terms of driving experience, comfort, features, etc..  If I go another 6 months in this rental Ford Escape, with consideration of the trade in value of my Lincoln MKX, Lincoln would or should find a way to see fit to place me in a brand new Lincoln MKC with what they're paying Hertz long term for the Escape combined with my MKX trade in value..., which would seem or appear to be the right and proper thing to do in terms of customer service and customer satisfaction; not to mention convenience for me.  I have to renew the contract with Hertz every month, one month by phone, and the next month by physically visiting Hertz with the Ford Escape to complete the rental paperwork.  Hertz is not right around the corner. 

I should add Lincoln has been responsive and accommodating but the truth and hard fact is my family and I were put at risk, and in possible jeopardy, for nothing more than the monetary bottom line in my opinion.  Google the phrase ""Takata airbag recall"" and read about the severe injuries and death.  That alone tells the whole story.  Lincoln has an opportunity here like no other, an opportunity to really do the right thing in terms of true customer
 satisfaction.  This experience has been a true paroxysmal cephalalgia for me.  And the migraine persists with little to no abatement in sight.

In November 2018, after using a Ford Escape rental for 10 months, I had to get rid of the MKX.  The MKX sat for 10 months without being able to be used or operated on the beach in the salt air.  Ford had me sign an agreement not to use it in order to qualify for the rental so my MKX sat idle until the Takata airbag was repaired/replaced and I had to return the rental.  In the meantime the MKX AC compressor stopped working, a fuel leak developed back by the muffler so ther was a noticeable smell of gasoline, all the chrome around the windows pitted, the brakes rusted, the roof rusted, and there was mold that formed on the seats and interior door areas.  In good conscience I couldn't even sell it.  So I traded the MKX in at Island Lincoln for a new 2019 Lincoln MKC with a warranty.  I liked the MKC, it was a good deal, and the Black Label covers normal wear items which is significant living on the ocean with the salt air.

lincoln,mkx,2008,Todd W., 02/12/2010,Bargain Luxury,4,"I wanted a vehicle that could tow up to 3500 pounds and not drive like a noisey / bouncy truck. This car is awesome! I've had it over a year now, put 15,600 miles on it, and it has operated flawlessly. To make it perfect, I've added an aftermarket backup camera and additional matching wood trim to the ""Plain Jane"" painted areas around the radio / center console areas. I love that it can quietly / rapidly accelerate and briskly corner without leaning.  Year - end rebates, bonus cash, and generous dealer discounts made it irresistible."
lincoln,mkx,2008,Mike in Minnesota, 07/18/2009,MKX in Minnesota,4,"Have owned ten or more SUVs in the past 25 years, many costing far more.  The MKX is the best in build quality, ride, comfort, and features. Very tight and quiet. "
lincoln,mkx,2008,Morris Sgro, 12/13/2009,Over-rated,3,"As far as the exterior style goes, nice lines, sharp looking! Here comes the bad news! It has a horrible exhaust noise that sounds like a cow ready to give birth! The ride is smooth if you're on a newly paved road, but at higher speeds, turn up the volume! The MKX needs to be find tuned, there are just too many squeaks and rattles for it to be marked Lincoln! It's a glorified Ford Edge! Too bad! Nice looking!"

I had shopped extensively, and being used to high-end vehicles, was amazed at the array of options that came with the MKX. Exterior/interior were gorgeous! I've had it almost two years now, and still get stares while on the road.  We all know what they are, so I'll decline to mention them here, again. However, after only two years, my lovely car must go.  It seems to stay in the shop more than in my garage! The service dept seems clueless, too, with this SUV.

We were going to buy a less expensive crossover, but were glad we didn't. ""Sync"", however, is annoying. The usb port for the ipod is great, no wires,  charges the ipod. Voice commands aren't worth the trouble. The indexing tells you each time that it experienced problems and you need to go their website - right! The phone would not stay connected with the bluetooth. The dealer and tech support were no help. Overall, great car."

No sqeaks or rattles!) Its a V6 but it has all the zip of a V8. The satellite radio, sound system, MS Sync, power and USB ports are all terrific. Couldn't do without them now."
lincoln,mkx,2008,Best SUV On The Road, 05/29/2020,Top Notch SUV Fun to Drive,5,"I'm driving a 1 owner 2008 MKX that was just serviced at 225K   It did have the airbag recall which was a problem, but it's not Lincoln's fault that somebody made a faulty airbag!!  At 194K was the first time on a tow truck when a transmission problem came up, but at $801 later it was running like new, and at 223K it got another ride on a tow truck because the cooling fans quit working.  The oil is changed every 5k with tire rotation too.  I put 60k on the original Michelin's then I went with Cooper tires.  It has heated and cooled seats that still work!! No water pump issues at 225K either!!   This vehicle sees the Ford/Lincoln dealer every 5K and it has had all the service work done on it.   Flush the radiator coolant can only help your water pump; remember this one has 225K with original water pump!!  Also the transmission has been serviced by Ford at the recommended miles.  The original brakes went to 135K  Neighbors can't believe this vehicle has the miles on it and it still looks new!!   Would I buy one again, yes I would!!   The most important thing a driver can do is have his vehicle serviced at the dealership by certified mechanics because I think that's why this MKX has the miles it has now.  But we do have a great service department at our local Ford Lincoln dealership   Gas mileage is fair up to about 27-28 on the highway

Ford has no idea how to correct the problem.  I am very disappointed with the company.  The car is absolutely wonderful but the experience is being ruined by the mechanical problem that Ford cannot fix.  If they finally get it right the car will be wonderful.

The MKX, in my opinion, is a better value-offering more options and toys than many other similar crossovers. While the MKX is slightly longer than the 2008 RX 350, the new 2009 RX 350 will be 5"" longer in 2009 and a new design. While some have complained that the MKX seats are too firm ,we actually like the firmness.The Ford Sync and the navigation systems are fantastic. Very user friendly.

Which we love even more! Ford/L makes a great product. Its really sad to see all the negative press that our American car manufactures recieve. I, for one, don't get it. We looked around at all the alternatives in the crossover market and found the MKX hard to beat. Now that we have been driving it for two weeks, we are extremely satisfied. Great ride, very nice and comfortable intererior,great sound & toys and what a great sunroof! Fantastic! Next best thing to having a convertable. Well done Ford/Licoln. If you're looking for a new crossover, we highly recommended this one"
lincoln,mkx,2008,Ray in NH, 12/21/2008,OK,2,"Looking for a lot of features packed into one vehicle that you can buy for $36,000, (with elite and ultimate packages), this vehicle is a good value. We have driven BMW and Mercedes brands for the past 20 years. This vehicle is no match. Buying a two year old ML320 is a better value. Especially when the Lincoln gets 17.5 MPG highway. My wife would drive just about anything. If I don't have to drive this car more than once per week, that's plenty."

It is wonderful to drive when it is running! Service department seems to have no clue on what is wrong.  Can anyone say lemon? it is unfortunate that I have had this experience because I had my eye on a Lincoln for a long time before I decided to buy one.  Now it seems I made a huge mistake.  I am thinking about getting a more reliable vehichle and just giving up on my pretty Lincoln.  I need a car that is dependable because I have an infant and I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road again.  So sad
lincoln,mkx,2008,Lanis, 03/24/2008,Move away from the 'edge',4,"Compared the Edge to the MKX and the MKX is a better value and better looking. Bought the MKX in March with the 20"" chrome wheels and black exterior. Looked at an another MKX with the 18"" wheels but the 20"" looks extra nice. The monochrome limited edition completes the package! Average 18 MPG in mixed driving with no problems at all. Really like the telescoping wheel since I am very tall. Lots of rear seat room as well as room behind the rear seats. Good size for a family of four. Was worried about not having AWD since I live in snow country, but the FWD MKX did extremely well in our last major snowstorm!"
lincoln,mkx,2008,Doug Bunnell, 06/08/2008,Won Over By This One,4,"We have never been Ford product fans, but fell in love with the MKX at our local auto show in Nov. This was 5 months after we purchased a 2008 Lexus RX350, which is our 7th Lexus. The Lexus was for my wife and I traded in my convertible after falling in love with the MKX. We both love the MKX. It is much more comfortable on long trips than the RX. My wife took the MKX over and I drive the RX to and from work. We get many positive comments on the MKX. We have the black with the 20"" chrome wheels. The Sync is awesome and much, much better than the similar system in the RX.  We love the Vista roof and all the goodies.

My wife loves the Sync system, NAV system and THX sound system.  "
lincoln,mkx,2008,Lincoln MKX, 07/22/2008,Midlife Vehicle,4,"I drive a state vehicle for work and my wife has a one mile commute to work so our personnal vehicles have very low mileage. We do take a trip from Boston to NJ to visit the grandkids on our free weekends so we were looking for a real nice vehicle to make the trip a little easier. We searched around and decided on a MKX. It has already made four trips to NJ without any disappointments, it makes the journey so much more pleasureable. The MKX has not disappointed us one iota. But I have a question on the wheels, has anyone else noticed the chrome is seperate from the aluminum wheel? The Navigator wheel looks the same but it is one piece. And I have heard of the chrome on the MKX wearing off."
lincoln,mkx,2008,jjake96, 08/04/2008,Automatic Trunk,4,We love this crossover. Rides nice and interior features are excellent.  Had car for about 2 months and the only problem we encountered is the automatic trunk opener. Opens and doesn't close. It goes down and up and not closing properly. Been at the dealership twice already.  
lincoln,mkx,2008,Peter NM CT., 08/28/2008,"Great Luxury, Workmanship, Handling",5,"This vehicle exceeeds expectation, I looked at the Lexus RX in Greenwich CT. It was small. The workmanship, quality, and fuel economy are great in this American product. "
lincoln,mkx,2008,Brian, 10/06/2008,High Value Vehicle,4,"Have 2800 miles on the car and I absolutely love it. SYNC (very easy to use), THX sound and Sirius are outstanding.  Cooled/heated seats, very quiet & comfortable interior, headlights that move with steering, power liftgate are major additions. Engine/transmission powerful and smooth.  Comparing my Limited with any competitor was not even close from a value perspective. This was a great buy.  Mileage better than I thought - 19 around town and 22+ on the highway.  Handles equally well in town or on the highway - a true pleasure to drive.  Seats 4-5 people more comfortably than any of its competitors.  Insurance cost was surprisingly low.  Don't overlook this car.  It is awesome!"
lincoln,mkx,2008,Clayt, 11/17/2008,Beats Lexus 350 IMO,5,"My wife has been driving a Lexus 350 (3 different year models) for nine years.With nothing exciting about the Lexus styling anymore, we jumped to the Lincoln MDX. We sure don't miss the Lexus for a second.  For a man, the Lincoln is a much better fit. I don't have to contend with the pull-down skinny armrests any longer when I drive it. And the features have it over the Lexus by a mile.  Don't have to pay an extra $3500 either for blue tooth as in Lexus. Lincoln's phone sync is great.  Gas mileage is better than Lexus at 24mpg on road, and the sun roof is fantastic. I love this crossover and will get one myself at the end of 2009."
lincoln,mkx,2008,Dr Mutzi, 12/05/2008,Great Crossover,5,"Fun to drive - always gets excellent reviews and comments from others.  Had the vehicle for 11 months, driven over 20000 miles, average 23.5 mpg and did I say it was AWD. Love the phone, sunroof, interior, and open space.  Also, I tow this vehicle behind my motorhome for over 10000 miles with no problems."
lincoln,mkx,2008,Vince, 01/03/2009,I put it through it's paces,4,"I researched and drove just about every mid sized SUV out there before deciding on the MKX. It came down to the Lexus RX and the MKX.  No question, the MKX is a better value than the RX, especially with the year deals out there.  I bought the MKX the day before Christmas.  We took it on a long trip the week after Christmas that involved roughly 2,000 miles of driving.  FL to NC to VA and back to FL. The driving was a good mix of interstate, around town and curvy mountain roads.  I could not be happier with the performance and handling! We averaged roughly 24 MPG on the highway, 18 around town.  Right on the money per the window sticker.  This car is everything I expected and more!"
lincoln,mkx,2008,2ND LINCOLN MKX , 01/06/2009,2nd Lincoln MKX in ten days,4,"Aggressive, yet very inviting, approachable appearance of the car.  My wife now has a black MKX and I chose the White Chocolate for keeping the car clean looking. I'm a Buick owner (3 Regals) for the quiet and comforting cars they build. My wife wanted the Lincoln MKX.  On the drive home, I instantly fell for the new levels of quiet in this Ford product - didn't believe it at first.  No creaks, no sounds, and all the way around well functionally constructed design.  Whether finding a comfortable seat, accessing the cargo bay or opening up the Vista roof, all are a pleasure.   "
lincoln,mkx,2008,jbfalaska, 01/06/2009,Moved over to Lincoln,4,"Always a Buick owner. Quiet, rubber soft quiet tires, yet with power are my likes. Hated Ford products due to the incessant noise. No longer. I bought a black MKX for my wife and on the drive home, turned around and bought another 5 days later.  Incredibly roomy, well thought out access to all seats, great sync features, good sound system, and the leather seats look tight yet flexible for seating.  "
lincoln,mkx,2008,Roger C, 01/25/2009,Design for cold? No,3,"Four months of driving and I still have problems with knocked knee caps on the dash. I took it in hoping that there was a recall on the tail gate lifting cylinders as any time below 32 degrees it only lifts 3/4 open. Slow learner took me two head knocks to remember to push up to load, so I have to open back gate before taking things out of the house. My Town and Country does not have this problem.  Dealer said it works when in the shop and would do nothing to fix the problem.  As a new stock holder I hate to write this but as a tax payer I more understand why some companies should go out of business."
lincoln,mkx,2008,RT, 02/20/2009,Wow!,4,"What an incredible car. We had a 2006 Cadillac CTS. Had to move to something not RWD and a little bigger. Looked at the Edge, looked at GM products, as I was a GM loyalist, but nothing compared to the MKX. Great styling, superb comfort, cool features, all rolled into one little sharp CUV. I could go on and on about this vehicle. We usually change cars it seems like every couple of years. I don't see us giving up the MKX. Oh I almost forgot, zero interest as well. Now who doesn't love free money! What a super value all around. Always looking forward to the next time I get to drive it.  "
lincoln,mkx,2008,twotrees, 02/05/2008,Lovin' It,4,"After being sure that my next car would be the Acura MDX, I drove the Lincoln MKX at my husband's request...and now I own a fully-loaded Limited Edition MKX.  I found the MKX to have a softer, quieter ride, better visibility, and easier to use features- -not to mention an amazing panoramic sunroof.  With the addition of SYNC on the 2008, the deal was sealed.  Although many do not consider the MKX a competitor for the MDX, a side-by side comparison reveals a more luxurious feel and all the option--for considerably less.  Although many feel American cars are not as reliable..I decided not to trade my 1999 Navigator with 165,000 that is still going strong!"
lincoln,mkx,2008,KeyedUp, 02/06/2008,What A Car!,5,"Well, gotta tell you that this car is great.  Ford just might have a winner here.  Sure its a re-packaged Ford Edge, but they pulled it off.  Fit and finish are perfect. Ride, handling and preformance are what you'd expect. Well worth the extra dough over an Edge. I considered other crossovers, but they came off to me as either a station wagon or a small truck. Performace is better in the Lexus and couple of others which was nice but not important as the MKX is better priced. The MKX will get out of the way and run with any of them. Now, I only have a 1,000 miles with half that coming on a road trip that gave me 19.4 MPG. You gotta give MKX a look."
lincoln,mkx,2008,Neewbs, 02/11/2008,Excellent Car & Beautiful Too,4,"Absolutely fantastic car.  My two pros for the vehicle, the SYNC system and ride quality, makes this car the most unique in its class.  It is definitely worth taking a look at."
lincoln,mkx,2008,tcm, 02/25/2008,A Fun Ride,5,"I researched the MKX and the Edge to death and decided on the MKX because of all the ""bells and whistles"". This car is so much fun to drive. Coming from an Expedition, this car still has a lot of room to transport two kids and all their sport equipment. I love the quiet ride and being wrapped in luxury. The Bluetooth capability is awesome."
lincoln,mkx,2008,porsche7, 03/02/2008,I did my homework!,4,"I love this car. Looked at Lexus ES350, Mercedes E-Class, Audi. I kept coming back to this car for its overall value, fun factor and genuine interest in how Lincoln could put all of this in such an affordable package. I can use this as a family car or just go out for a ride by myself.  I do my homework when it comes to cars and I feel I was well rewarded."
lincoln,mkx,2008,KeyedUp, 03/03/2008,Second Post,5,"I've had such good experience with this car, I had to send in another review.  Gas mileage has greatly improved.  Pure interstate driving yeilded 25 MPG and around town at 16 MPG so I'm very pleased for this sized auto. Comfort, fit and finish all very good and the ride gets better everytime I'm in the car. Now, my wife has discovered the MKX so she's driving it whenever possible.  She like the great visiability without the big SUV size."
lincoln,mkx,2008,jason, 03/07/2008,Impressive Vehicle,5,"Very well built, impressive vehicle.  It's got all the creature comforts, plenty of room, and gets good fuel economy for something of its size."
lincoln,mkx,2008,fruntha1, 11/28/2007,Buy American and love it!,4,I drove all the crossovers and desided on the MKX.It has the best ride of all. I consider the MKX the best looking of all the crossovers.
lincoln,mkx,2008,Jason, 12/03/2007,Wow,5,The more I drive it the more I like it.  My MKX is epuipped with the Sync system which lets you tell it what you'd like to hear or who you'd like to call through Bluetooth.  I've got a 160 GB hard drive connected to the system and can voice command my entire music library which is absoulutely amazing.  I actually like the firmer seats that some of the reviews reference as a negative. They feel very German (I had a BMW that had very firm seats). The interior is great. Materials are quite nice and the ride is very quiet. My neighbor that has a 2007 M-B ML 63 AMG wants to trade in for the Lincoln (I'm not kidding).He can't get over the sound system and the Vista Roof.  I would definitely recommend
lincoln,mkx,2008,aes, 03/21/2008,Not for Winding Roads or steep grades,4,"We live on a mountain with a 15% grade for 4 miles. Our last car, a Montego, performed excellently with a CVT. It lacked power and was noisy so we wanted the same car with a Lincoln trim. The MKX seemed like the best answer and they market the 6 speed transmission as barely perceptable shifting. The CVT is no longer available. Since all of the Lincoln dealers shut down near our house we bought this 50 miles away without a test drive on our hill. Big mistake! It is truly wonderful as all other reviewers say on normal roads but the transmission hunts horribly on our hill.  The L setting shifts from 2nd to first abruptly when slowing around blind corners and you have to go back to D to  2nd. "
lincoln,mkx,2008,Disappointed, 04/07/2008,Disappointed,3,"Have 1300 miles on car. Have owned several Fords-no problems. Bought this car to keep several years-wrong move. Very disappointed. Engine has loud single pecking noise at cold start after auto choke shuts down. Getting worse. Service department & Ford engineer hears noise, don't know what is causing it and that nothing can be done about it-say some do it and some don't? Also, constant struggle with steering- pulls out of road-wears me out to drive it. Feels like it doesn't have power steering at times. Service dept has checked and says normal for FWD-I have owned other FWDs that did not do that-a little stiffer steering I expected but not this. Bad move buying this car-lot of money wasted"
lincoln,mkx,2008,3dsnmj, 12/12/2007,Love My Crossover!,4,I researched and test drove several crossovers over the past year. We chose the Lincoln MKX.  It had the best features at a great price!  It's truly an attractive crossover.
lincoln,mkx,2008,Ms.KXpress, 04/30/2008,"A year looking, worth the wait",5,"My lease was coming up on my landrover Lr3 so instead of emotional decisions (not good) I did my homework. I narrowed down a yearlong search to Lexus Rx, Lincoln MKX, and BMW X5.The BMW was only OK on the inside, after 3years in my LR3 I didn't want any sporty black plastic.I wanted wood,leather and comfort.I couldn't decide so I dealed on both.While I had to drop alot of toys to get the price I wanted on the Lexus, I actually added stuff to my MKX(dual dvd's in headrest)plus my maintenance is free. My kids (three boys) LOVE the MKX.The comfort of the back seats that recline,big sunroof,and awesome THX surround sound. I couldn't be happier! Geez, I forgot to mention the sync :) LOL"

I am absolutely blown away that a 5-year-old car with 101,000 miles can still run like new and look like new.
The ride is quiet and the creature comforts are outstanding.
Heated/cooled seats in the front and heated rear seats as well as the panoramic sunroof and incredible sound system round out the excellent package.
It holds the road well due to its wide stance.
This has gota be one of the nicest used cars I have ever seen and driven."
lincoln,mkx,2009,cjoanne, 02/23/2010,Extremely Satisfied Buyer,4,"I have owned 2 SUV 's in the past, and this is the type vehicle I like/need for my work. I researched the MKX along with Lexux, & Enclave, and chose MKX. I'm glad I did, and would do it again in a heartbeat. I love this car! The handling of the car is tops on my list, and it looks great!"
lincoln,mkx,2009,Penney, 08/26/2010,Sweet Ride,4,"I gave my husband the MKX for his 50th birthday. He had always wanted a Lincoln and needs AWD to reliably make it to work. He loves this car. It is fun to drive, he likes the height, it is powerful and the computer is great. So far the computer had to be replaced at 15K because the blue tooth failed and the exterior driver side door handle came off in his hand at 17K. Lincoln replaced everything without charge but it was a hassle."
lincoln,mkx,2009,Tim, 07/22/2009,Very Pleased With My MKX!,4,"This car is very quite and comfortable. We had a Ford Explorer and the front room is comparable to the Explorer. The rear room is better than the Explorer. There are a lot of items the MKX has that are not available on the Ford Edge Limited such cooled seats, softer suspension, real wood interior trim, satellite radio, better seats and thicker carpet, and many other items. We are averaging 18 mpg in stop and go traffic. The car is solid and so far very reliable. It is a top safety pick and anyone in the market for a midsize crossover should drive an MKX before making a purchase."
lincoln,mkx,2009,James M, 03/24/2009,My New MKX,5,"I picked up my MKX leased vehicle on 3/20 with AWD and the luxury and technology is amazing. I had an SEL Edge for the prior two years, and liked it, but this is a whole other level."
lincoln,mkx,2009,Kansas Mom, 04/12/2009,I love my MKX!,5,"I am very pleased with the mkx. It is fun to drive (I used to drive a full- size suv). The ride is so smooth. There is some wind noise, but not like I've had with past vehicles. I'd say it's a very nice, quiet ride -- unless the stereo is on. It's a great system. My kids & I like to play the THX demo before we ""take off."" I like the way the car handles. I'd recommend it to anyone shopping for a new vehicle. I chose this over the rdx and enclave (my top 3) and I am so so happy that I chose the Lincoln. I was worried about cargo room, but I have the space for everything I've needed so far. The seats are real easy to fold down (and they recline!)if needed. Final words - I love my mkx!"
lincoln,mkx,2009,Denita, 07/11/2009,Fabulous Experience!!,5,"I shopped for >8 months for an SUV. I drove the Lexus, Infiniti, & Acura mid size & truly neither compared to the luxury of my MKX.

lincoln,mkx,2009,5119, 06/02/2015,Interior Trim,3,The flashing around the vents melted first time we cut the heaters on. The interior door handles have some sort of aluminum foil wrapping that started coming off the second year leaving very sharp edges that will cut you hands. Dealer said these were not covered items. Don't walk but run from this for a nice interior. It is cheap plastic painted to look real. Fails quickly.
lincoln,mkx,2009,MKXBob, 06/19/2009,There's Hope for the Big 3!,5,"It was very important to consider an American manufacturer with this purchase, and I have no regrets!  Looked at just about every CUV on the market, and the MKX fit the bill.  Don't let anyone tell you it's just an Edge with a Lincoln grill in it.  All the reviews that said that scared me away - finally a friend talked me into driving one, and then I was sold.  Much smoother ride, nicer appointments, better warranty, quieter interior, and trans shifts better than the Edge.  This vehicle really has exceeded my expectations in all regards - even fuel economy - have already averaged 24.6 mpg driving on the Northeast Extension thru Philly.  Not too big, not too small - JUST RIGHT!  No problems!"

A similar equipped import would have cost $20,000 more than the MKX.  Trust the reviews of the owners and not auto reviewers.  Real owners seem to like the vehicle more than the car reviewers."
lincoln,mkx,2010,nat, 10/05/2010,American Luxury,4,"We traded our beloved Ford Fusion for something bigger and more luxurious. We are very pleased with our choice. The MKX is large enough to haul our family and our things, but it is not difficult to drive around town. The handling in inclement weather is great. We had our MKX for a few weeks before a blizzard struck. It handled the snow and ice without any problems."

My sister talked me into going to test drive an MKX....I loved the vehicle as soon as I sat in the drivers seat!  I absolutely love the cooling and heating seats too!!  I've had no mechanical problems, other than normal required maintenance.  My only improvement would've been automatic side windows, (I have to reach in or out of the vehicle to close the side mirrors).  This is one of the best vehicles I've had the pleasure of driving, I plan to drive this SUV until the wheels fall off (hopefully I'm not in it at that time) LOL!!!  I love it!

lincoln,mkx,2010,Geoff Edwards, 10/09/2017,A beautiful car with a very dark side,4,"I have been driving this car for several hundred miles and have come to the conclusion that Lincoln don't seem to really know much about actual driver involvement - this is a fine car to be a passenger in, but it's a miserable vehicle to drive in the long term. The engine/trans has a decided lag between pressing the pedal and when it actually starts to accelerate. The steering has a 'notch' at its neutral position, wherever that may be at the time, where reversing input on the wheel causes it to skip about 2 degrees before the power unit kicks over, then it's reasonably smooth. The instrument panel appears very plain and poorly-designed, with several functions such as outside air temp and time only displayed far down on the center console; too much info the driver needs is not within the driver's most important view. For a car of its size, it has poor head- and legroom for a 6'2 driver, especially with the panoramic sunroof; there is no place to put one's left foot comfortably, and the driver's knees invariably end up against very hard plastic corners on both the door-mounted armrest and the center console. There is not enough rearward travel on the seat, and raising the seat also moves it forward, so there is nothing gained there; the seat is comfortable around town, but after a long highway trip, the driver's legs, hips and back can be very stiff and sore. The SYNC system is easily the worst infotainment system on the market (this is the 201 version - it has been upgraded several times since then); not only does it not sync at all with some mass-market phones (i.e. this reviewer's Samsung Galaxy Note 3), it often gets stuck in the connection mode and will not switch to any other using any of the buttons, and the car has to be shut off to reset it. The manual tuning knob has no detents, so changing a station requires both finesse and the driver's eyes far to the right and down - a small turn usually skips through 2 stations, yet trying to move through several stations rapidly is a chore worse than trying to use a corkscrew - after several turns, you find you've only gone through 7 or 8 stations. The USB port does not have enough power to charge a phone. Inserting a USB thumbdrive results in an index of the files, which appear to be played in alphabetical order, despite how they may be organized on the drive, although one can group them; your best option is to use the power port with a dedicated charger, and use a 3.5mm patch cable to hook your phone's headphone jack to the car's aux input.

The A/C works exceptionally especially in humid weather conditions. It has plenty of power and the braking system is great as well.

The MKX has been a great vehicle for traveling. The vehicle is comfortable, roomy, performs well in all weather conditions, and for the size has good performance. The gas mileage is the only down side. We took the vehicle on a 4000 mile trip and 19-21mpg on the highway is the best we could get.

I am in the automotive business so I was able to do a lot of research and test drives on similar Crossovers and found the MKX the best in safety (5 Star) and value. Went to Orlando this weekend, a 3 hour trip and the MKX met all our expectations: Comfort, Fuel Mileage and Luggage space. This vehicle is replacing a BMW that I had for 3 years and the car was wonderful so the MKX needed to fill big shoes and it did. The X5 would have been my other choice but was smaller and almost 15-20k more. The X3 was out of the line up as it was even smaller. All the other imports in my opinion were over priced and over rated."

I need to be able to comfortably maneuver and park in garages.  I also wanted something high end and very well built and with good value.  For me the 2010 MKX fit the bill.  I received a good deal for a fully loaded model and it turned out to be only a few thousand more than a loaded Ford Edge, but, much better appointed.  Get the Xilon coating.  The first week I parked it outside at a shopping center and some retard decided to key it from the front fender all the way down to the rear.  It buffed right out. "

This is my first crossover vehicle. We live in Philadelphia where the roads are terrible. The MKX is very smooth with excellent handling. There are no blind spots to worry about due to the large side mirrors. The overall responsiveness of the MKX is great when driving in challenging conditions like snow. We just received 24"" of the white stuff and the MKX remained under control at all times. The turning radius is excellent as well when trying to negotiate small side streets and tight parking spaces.

At the very beginning we ran into a snow storm the highway was poorly plowed and the MKX with AWD did not miss a beat I saw numerous vehicles off the road 18 wheelers, cars and trucks.  The MKX was awesome, it was hard to see the shoulder and I drove on it several times it just did not miss a beat.  The best driving car I every drove."

My wife has to sit under the steering wheel to reach the pedals. The auto seat buttons are not located in the proper place. Whit them mounted on the side of the door, when you lean over to reach an ATM or to pay a toll you lean against the buttons and the seat will start moving, also I bumped the buttons several times with my elbow while driving and the seat started moving. The rear vents cannot be shut off if someone get too hot or cold (had to put a towel over them to shut them off)."
lincoln,mkx,2010,thomas, 09/14/2010,dual climate control,3,"I purchased a 2010 Lincoln MKX and am dissatisfied with the dual climate control air conditioning system. The system in the automatic mode does not cool the vehicle as stated in the manual. This was witnessed by service manager at the Ganley dealership in cleveland as well as a regional rep. They state the system is working within ford's parameters. Flaw is that if the temperature outside is above 80 degrees the inside temp of the system is set at 70 or 72, when the temp inside the vehicle hits 80 the fan speed will reduce, and the vehicle will not cool in a reasonable amount of time (20 minutes? )as the manual states.I cannot safely drive and dial in the manual a/c."

This crossover hauls to say its around 200 hp less than my range s/c. I test drove every similarly sized crossover I could think of and none come close. The Cadillac SRX is nice but sluggish and the lexus was oddly laid out on the inside.

I never would have thought that I would have bought a Lincoln at 34 (I think of my Dad's old car) but this is definitely a new wave of Lincolns. I came out of a Land Rover LR3 with the Mark Kardon system and the THX sound in the MKX blows it away.

 I personally have an issue with my phone not staying linked to the car.
It constantly disconnects, then re-connects.
4 to 6 times during a 20 minute ride to work. 

The computer that's in the car reminds me of an old 386.
It works, but works slowly (relatively speaking).
It sometimes takes 20 seconds or more before the radio starts playing after start-up.
NEVER try to use the touch screen before the system is completely loaded...(about 45 seconds).
If you do, it will not work well.

But all this can/will be fixed.

lincoln,mkx,2011,Walt, 12/05/2016,Pros and Cons,3,"Pros. . . Very comfortable heated and cooled memory front seats. Especially comfortable and workable for my handicapped wife. Looks good, people often comment on what a ""nice looking vehicle"" it is. Cruise control is very good; will keep you within a few mph of setting whether going up or down grades. Back up camera is very helpful. Cons. . .GPS is a disaster. It will not respond to owner manual instructions to set up destinations, whether by voice or touch. Plus the route it takes you on to get somewhere is very often miles out of the way. Not even a close match to a simple Garmin. Has expensive to fix quirks like check engine light. Even though we have the ""full"" warranty, the dealership charges us $100 to use the warranty, and repairs are often ""not covered."" A simple 100K check up cost me almost $1,000 because a little problem (their words) was not fully covered under the warranty. We bought the vehicle used and got the full extended bumper to bumper warranty (so we were told). Guess they are not dealers of their word. Touch screen has its issues as well. If I touch the Navigation screen to look ahead for turns it will respond and jump ahead, however when I touch to return to where we are on the route, it tells me that it will not respond when the vehicle is moving. Really? It just did respond, but now it will not and it leaves me lost for the moment. There is a setting in the electronic section that says it will memorize certain of your settings. Sometimes it loses its memory. Example, you are supposed to set a temperature you like and by touching ""My Temp"" on the dash, it is supposed to go to that setting. It will not keep that setting, no matter how many times I follow the due process. Since first posting this, more electronic problems have arisen. Presently in the midst of having the passenger door handle replaced. Getting ""Passenger Door Ajar"" warning light, even though the door is not ajar. This replacement will cost approx $500. I understand it is a common problem. Shouldn't Lincoln cover this with a call back? And the list goes on. . .

lincoln,mkx,2011,fordlincoln, 06/09/2011,Simply a great car!!!!,5,"This is my 3rd consecutive Lincoln - just sold my 06 LS and bought the 11 MKX.
This car is fantastic.
I did compare this with Cadillac SRX and it was really no comparison at all.
The Lincoln simple had more standard features that I wanted.

The new looks and the highly advanced technology really sold me on this vehicle.
IMO, the new front grill and the new taillight design are BIG improvements over the previous MKX.
The MyLincoln Touch sync system is unbelievable.
I am far from a techie, but I do like new technologies and the MyLincoln Touch system is great. If you are not very proficient with new technology you may have a longer learning curve, but it is well worth it. I am still finding new things out and I have had the car for almost 3 weeks. I actually like the the touch screen technology more than the voice recognition. It is very similar to using a smartphone."
lincoln,mkx,2011,FrankC, 05/22/2017,"Unreliable, expensive, poor ride quality.",1,"People should know that the MKX is not a good car. This is not my first Lincoln. I had a 90 Town Car that I drove a quarter million miles before trading it to the dealer for a Navigator that I drove for 385,000 miles. I still own my 1998 Mark VIII and that car is incredibly reliable.

Not incredibly reliable for a 20 year old car, but just plain reliable; it's as good as a new car, and far better than the MKX. The MKX has problems that are well-known with the touch screen. The software is poor. The hardware is unreliable, though ford extended the warranty for the FCP. But it's not just the navigation and entertainment system that's awful. 

I had an oil pressure problem that cost $500 to fix. The PTU went bad, which costs $2,200 to replace. There are articles on the Edge/MKX forums about people having problems with PTUs that fail anywhere from 50,0000 to 80,000 miles. The panoramic sunroof sticks. The dealer says that it's normal but there have been times that I've had to pull it closed while holding the close button. I just don't use that expensive option anymore. 

I've been seeing a lot of people complaining about water pump problems. In ford's genius, they put the water pump BEHIND the timing chain cover so that when the seals fail, the coolant goes straight into the oil pan, displaces the engine oil, and destroys the engine. If you get lucky and look very carefully at a small hole near the alternator, you may see the start of coolant weeping and have the water pump replaced ($2,300) before it fails. Or, like most people, not see any signs of problems until the pump fails. New engine: $7,000. The Internet is your friend, search for yourself and see how many people are having problems. The problem with these issues is that the PTU is used on all the all wheel drive fords, the water pump is in the same place on many of ford's V6 engines. The scope of the problem is massive. Just buy something else.


UPDATE:
Edmonds sent an email requesting an update.

My MKX was totaled on 31 Aug by a pickup truck that was out of control and rammed me from behind at 190,000 miles. Overall, I did no major repairs from 140,000 to 190,000 and only replaced a few sensors, which were inexpensive, as well as all of the calipers when one of them seized.

I was lucky that the water pump seals never let go. The PTU problem can be avoided if the gear oil is drained and refilled at every second or third oil change. That's not an easy task because there is no drain plug, but changing the oil frequently will save a $2,300 repair bill. Gear oil changes will keep the PTU from failing, but there's no fix for the vent problem that causes gear oil to drip onto the exhaust pipe that's under the PTU.

I guess the driver that hit my MKX did me a favor. I'm done with ford forever and am now driving a Mercedes Benz E-Class that I love more than any other car I've owned in the past 20ish years.

lincoln,mkx,2011,gmusser, 12/09/2010,One Awesome Crossover,5,"I researched this rig a lot and it is exceeding all the good news I found.
We got a loaded one including the adaptive cruise - that is a great safety feature.
The backup camera is awesome and there are also sensors in the taillights - not on the bumpers - very cool.
On the second day, my wife was backing up and the sensors went off because a woman started walking behind her - an injury/law suit saved.
The car has many redundancies built in which are extremely valuable.
For example, the car can be entered with the fob, the touch handle, the Securicode on the door, or a key that is in the fob.
It is keyless, pushbutton start - my wife leaves fob in her pocket.

The navigation is too hard and slow to use.
It will take about 5 full minutes to get a restaurant detestation into it.
The data base is WAY out of date.

lincoln,mkx,2011,Unhappy, 11/24/2010,Mytouch gone wrong,3,Ok looks good.  Feels good. But I believe I am part of the first recall with locking problem. In addition the technology of the car would be amazing if it did infact work. The phone will not sync with bluetooth. The navigation locks up. The rear camera blacks out in a regular basis and the only fix Lincoln has at this time is temporary.  The disconnect the car battery for ten minutes to reset system. I have had the car for about 2 weeks now and the car mytouch system has failed at least 6 times and the temporary fix has lasted 5 day at most. The promise of a fix has been delayed twice now. Customer service at both ford and the dealership is lacking. This has been a issue ford was aware of. 
lincoln,mkx,2011,Christine O'Connor, 10/24/2015,MyLincoln Touch sinks this car,3,"The car is very comfortable, attractive and seems solidly built.  Tt drives great and would be a terrific commuter if not for the MyLincoln Touch system.  Which is awful!  It is enough to make me dislike the entire car and I regret buying it.  It's not responsive, the buttons are too small, the screens are busy, and even the physical volume and fan swipe controls often don't respond.  It's a worse hazard than using a smartphone while driving, I am amazed that vehicles are allowed to use this design.  I have set a rule for myself that I do not use it except for very minimal commands while driving because it's such a distraction from the road.  And since I commute 2 hours a day, that's a lot of time to spend with a junky system.  

I'm disappointed and embarrassed that I spent a lot of money on this car.  I will probably trade it in on something else.  This is the first time I've ever contemplated doing that, I've kept all my other cars for over 10 years and enjoyed them.  This one was a mistake.

Comfortable seats, Ride is quiet and comfortable on smooth roads but gets a little harsh on bumpy roads (probably due to the 20"" wheels). Rims are not chrome plated aluminum as stated, seems to be some type of wheel cover over alum rim. Overall build quality is substandard. Doors and tailgate do not line up properly.
Center A/C vent not installed properly is crooked. Rain sensing wipers occasionally wipe when no water is present. Bluetooth is unreliable with my Blackberry which is on the MYSYNC compatible list.

lincoln,mkx,2011,PattyG, 09/22/2017,Terrible engine broken at 74K,1,"1/6/2020 - YES!!!!  I finally got rid of this vehicle, trading it in for a 2020 Red Toyota 4Runner Off Road Premium...... love my new vehicle!!!

I bought this ""Top of the Line"" Elite Package car used, looking almost brand new in October 2014 with about 28,000 miles.  Less than 50,000 miles later, and it is now September 2017;  and the engine needs to be replaced... $7,100 - $7,200.   Are you kidding???  That is unacceptable.   Oh, and the dealership never heard of this problem happening!!!  Really ????   After reading numerous articles through various forums about Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX engines, I see that this is a huge problem.  There is  NO  way that any Ford or Lincoln dealership is not aware of this happening.   I purchased this Lincoln after having owned a 1999 Mercury Mountaineer Premier which was a terrific vehicle.   It seemed like a good idea even though it was extremely disappointing that the Mercury brand dissolved.  Shame on the salesman who took me on that trade-in and then sold me a junky MKX --- no quality.

Update:  3/31/18 - So, ever since the engine was replaced(October), there has been a rattle ( a sound like a wire rattling around ), mostly above 65 mph, which is why I did not hear it until traveling on the interstate. The mechanic shop that I had the engine replaced is a 1 to 1/2. hr. drive, and I work full-time, so going back to that shop was a mistake to begin with and something I am unable to do now.  I went to the local Lincoln dealer where I had originally purchased my car to have an oil change and check this noise.  Of course they saw nothing, and said to come back if it continues.  I had told them that you do not hear the noise until going over 65 mph.  And I cannot spend another couple of hundred dollars on yet another car rental for mine to be in the shop and ""hope"" they find the rattle.  So my rating of this vehicle continues to be poor.   When I finish paying it off, I will certainly be getting another vehicle and it will not be a Lincoln or a Ford.

Update - 10/2/2019.  Still have the MKX, almost paid off. Plan to trade within the next few months to get a long-lasting Toyota 4Runner. Never another Lincoln.  Mechanics have never figured out about the rattle.

Update - 10/3/2019.  SAME  PROBLEM  today as 2 WEEKS AGO.  TOWED AGAIN to dealer to fix....  lost power steering, check charging station came on.... last time they fixed it required installing belts which were gone and replace gasket cap.  Same problem today and had to have it towed yet again to dealer.  SUCH an UNRELIABLE vehicle.  Just 90,000 miles on it, 60,000 miles the last 5 years, the front leather seats are rubbing off.     Oh and still has rattle from a year ago when engine was replaced because the water pump broke.   Run away from Lincoln !!!

Within a week we had to do a 1,800 mile trip from NC to Indiana and back. The MKX performed faultlessly. The 3.7L V6 has more than ample power and cruises effortlessly. Fuel economy average was around 28mpg. This car is very quiet at highway speed and handles exceptionally well. Our MKX is black and turned numerous heads even on the highway.

Talking to it is like talking to a developmentally challenged child -- so when it gets something right my wife and I hi-five. Indexing music is like having a root-canal.

There is not a lot of leg room for taller people in the front passenger seat or the rear seats. It is so comfortable to drive, the handling is great, the get-up and go is fantastic! The cons for me were the touch screen and the MPG. I find all touch screens to be distracting while driving. I am not a fan of any touchscreen, but this one was easy to use. I have learned through research that the MPG is average for a vehicle with a motor like this. I absolutely love the remote start and automatic ac/heat/defrost settings. The extra bells and whistles of wireless phone connection, Bluetooth, MP3/USB ports are wonderful. My only big con is leg room for taller people. I am 5'3"" tall and I love how I sit up while driving and felt like I could control this vehicle very well. Visibility was great. Getting in and out of this car is great--I don't have to climb up and out. This car has power and a luxury, sporty feel to it.

Upon not doing so, I inadvertently applied too much pressure with my one finger and thereby broke the outer plastic. Thinking this would be a routine warranty issue I was shocked to find out from the Dealer that it was not and therfore necessitating me using my comprehensive insurance coverage to the tune of a whopping $1,900.00.

lincoln,mkx,2011,egcoffman, 06/01/2011,BlueTooth is Horrible in MKX!!,3,"For all the bells and whistles in this vehicle, a fully loaded 2011 Lincoln MKX, what literally has brought my wife to tears is the bumpy ride and the awful sound quality of the Bluetooth.
The bumpy ride is a product of the uber wheels which are very hard and thin as are all modern high performance tires.
The suspension should have been designed to compensate for those stiffer tires to reduce jarring to the driver and passengers.
But, the BIG problem is the Bluetooth!
The static is unbelievably bad!! Ford has failed to use a Bluetooth system that can operate with their electronics.
The static heard by the person you are talking to is literally deafening, especially at highway speeds."

It matched our driving style perfectly (suburban errands and roadtrips in Minnesota), and is every bit as solid as our Volvo.
Loaded it with every option except the ""cargo convenience"" package.
 AWD was a must, as were heated seats.
The MKX is only one of the group (Lexus RX350, Acura RDX, Volvo XC60, etc) with the higher ride of an SUV, without the attendant ""roll"" and bumps.
Noticeably quieter than the others.
The MYSYNC system works very well, but you MUST have the salesman walk you through the features, and limitations of the voice-activated interface.

It is quiet, a great highway car.
I got the Adaptive Cruise Control and this is a super safe option that makes long highway trips a breeze.
MPG is in the hight teens around town and I've gotten 22-24 on trips.
The side safety light indicators in exterior rear view mirrors are great.
The front seats are quite comfortable and the Heated-A/C option in the seats is great.
The insync system takes quite a while to learn but is very functional,but too many steps..less steps & more buttons would make it easier.

I traded a fully loaded Tahoe (which I dearly loved, but was getting up there in miles) and the transition has been a breeze.
I rated the car mostly 5's.

However, in time, and after 6000 miles, I have, indeed fallen in love with this car. I find myself chosing to drive it more and more.

At 10K miles the power steering went out and took the vehicle to ""Lincoln dealership for repairs and they had to fix the ""power steering"" over 6 times but would not classify the vehicle as a LEMON as they have experienced Lincoln advisors at the disposal of the service techs.  well my car is in the shop yet again for the same thing and they had my car for over 2 weeks and I just received a call that I will just have to live with the slight whining noise in the vehicle.   Are you kidding me.  Lincoln doesn't stand behind their products so please stay away.

Then the mechanic didn't tighten the bolts on the tire rod so another issue, I could have been killed no apologies from Lincoln.

The heated steering wheel is a god-send here in New Hampshire.  

I bought this vehicle used with only 12,000 miles and what a deal!  The gas mileage isn't the greatest at about 22mpg but thankfully gas is fairly cheap right now.  I'd rather give up gas mileage than skimp on comfort.  This is one of the most luxurious vehicles I have ever owned.

The FX 35 is not as roomy and accommodating.


So far this has been a joy to own.
Smooth and noise free driving.
I am surprised to see that others have not had this same experience.
 We had a 2010 VW Toureg prior to the Infiniti and it was built rugged as well as luxurious.
So, the MKX has a nice feel in the middle.
I think it will hold well to taking the dogs to the vet as well as transporting the grandchildren to activities.
I will come back and update after owning for a year, any negative issues. "
lincoln,mkx,2013,Pauley21, 10/19/2016,Luxury with some sportiness,5,"Overall I think this vehicle is very well built, strong engine, and AWD that is smart and knows what to do when you need it. I did purchase pre-owned with over 60,000 miles but I love the 3.7 V6 and transmission pairing. My mom has a 2013 as well, both of us enjoy it a lot. You can sit back and ride along with traffic comfortably, but when you need to get up and go or maneuver though traffic, the transmission and 3.7 V6 are quick and power you through what you need. It handles great around corners and through town. It's not too big but just big enough, anytime  I have rear passengers they always compliment the room they have and the heated seats.  My only complaint is the shifter, sometimes it doesn't know it's in Park and you have to jiggle the button a little, and after turning a corner when it's going into 2nd gear it's a tiny clunky, but my last car (Mazda) has the same issue, so I'm light with the gas pedal after turning corners.

We like the reliability and performance so far. We average 3 to 4 more MPG than our old Nissan with much better performance. The Interior is very comfortable, easy to get into and out of. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis so I appreciate that and the heated seats. In our opinion it is much better than the Cadillac's that we looked at."
lincoln,mkx,2013,lakegirl4, 10/03/2013,New MKX,4,"Just bought a 2013 MKX.
After owning Subaru Outbacks for years, I couldn't stomach the new ugly models with useless cargo racks.
I was looking for cargo space, kayak carrying capability, comfortable seats, a color other than gray, black or white, and gas efficiency.
The MKX beat out the Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland, the Cadillac, the VW Toureg, and the Lexus.
Most of the others had very ugly silver consoles.
The MKX has everything I was looking for and is beautiful inside.
The seats and finish are wonderful.
I love the steering wheel controls.
Only thing I'm not crazy about is the front end - low and massive.
First American branded car I've owned in over 30 years!
Good Job Ford!"
lincoln,mkx,2013,love2drive4, 07/25/2014,Still not happy with it - looks nice though,3,"I've had this car for 18+ months and I'm looking to trade.
At 5 months the brakes were making a terrible grinding.
My rotors already needed turning. I have since replaced the rotors at 35k miles.  Yes I ""still"" have the car - hauls kids hockey equipment well.
At one year, my battery needed replacing after many complaints of odd electrical malfunctions.
My wipers still go on for no reason, on a completely sunny day sitting at a stop light.
My radio features sometimes go awry, not going to preset channel or displaying two different stations on the dash compared to instrument cluster screen.
Acceleration is sluggish, once you're going ride is comfortable.
Absolutely hate the blinker.
Every time I use it I think its going to break and sometimes I flash my brights just using it.
Too hard to operate - what we're they thinking?!?  Wasn't it tested?
All weather tires are terrible in the snow/rain.  Hate to spend extra $ on winter tires although many do, but I have one tire that's sounding out of round and need a new set (even though they have half tread left).
Road noise is overwhelming and more than I should have for a ""luxury"" vehicle.
Once it turned past 50k and out of b2b warranty, started having issues with shifter and car recognizing its in ""P"" or park.  I have to fiddle with the shifter trigger every time until P is orange, then message goes away.
New issue at 68k miles - common to Edge / MKX - Door ajar, sensor issue.  Cost appears to be $375+.  Drivers door appears to be ajar, open/close and hope it goes away.  However one night after getting dash message to disappear I was driving down the road and system thought door was open, dash indicator appeared and all cabin lights came on making it very difficult to see.  Had to pull over and open/close door until message went away.
Also new issue:  Driving home, car just killed.  Lost power steering, power brakes.  Put it in park and started it again.  Really!?!  No codes appeared - well of course not!  Tech said its very hard to determine but did advise me not to leave key fob in the car or vicinity of the car.  It tries to make contact with the computer and may drain fob battery.  Thinks ""maybe"" day it killed there was a contact loss between fob and car and it didn't detect car was being driven with a key in it so it killed the engine.  I get the ""No Key Detected"" all the time, even with key in cup holder, my pocket, purse.  Doesn't matter.  
I did purchase winter tires for this car and what a world of difference it makes.  
Bluetooth speaker is slightly behind the visor, making it hard for others to hear you.
70k mile update - Traded.
Dealer said door sensor is a $4-500 fix.  Part alone is $180.  Common for driver and passenger front doors.  Sadly, no Ford recall on the issue currently.  
I could try the contact spray fix first, but many say it doesn't fix the problem.  I'm opening/closing my door 4-8 times each time I open it just to get the sensor to realize it's really closed.  This car has too many electrical issues for me to deem it reliable enough to repair and fix it.  Other than that, I did like the vehicle and would have rather kept it.  Electrical issues can be a hit/miss fix and end up costing thousands.  Hopefully someone else enjoys it, it lasts awhile and they don't get stalled somewhere.

No folding side mirrors, second seat not adjustable, no key memory for seat positions, lots less cargo space,
electric seats lack adjustable features as GM has, lackluster engine and poor gas mileage.......Lots of other bad comparisons....Guess I'll go back to GM."

lincoln,mkx,2013,Shirls, 05/17/2017,Great SUV for the Money!,4,"One of my priorities with getting a new vehicle was minimal road noise, in addition to a blend of performance, utility, and comfort. This SUV does everything I want. The cargo space if perfect for Costco runs, small items of furniture and similar. With the rear seats folded down there is more room, but because they don't lay flat, the extra room acquired is flattened since the lowest point is closer to the ceiling.  So, a bicycle, 2x4s, but nothing bulky.                                                                         
 The seats are comfortable, the car is responsive and quick enough to get out of hazardous situations. Braking is good (although apparently it takes 10 feet longer to stop than others SUVs in this class) I have had no maintenance/recall issues and I am at 55,000 miles.  Mileage is OK. If I drove in the city I would assuredly have bought a different vehicle, since it's hard to see, the mileage really declines in the city,  and the frame is essentially a giant box on wheels, which makes parking an adventure. The cons: mediocre sound system and poor visibility sides and rear. I even bought an aftermarket system, but it still isn't quite what I wanted. (My MKX is the standard model, and so had the low end sound system). Because the last thing you want to do is take out the factory unit, you have to add and tinker with components until you get the sound you want.

lincoln,mkx,2013,hpp2, 05/15/2014,Rusty paint product,1,My MKX is only seven months plus old with all features warranty plus anti rust package. But I am disappointed to see my MKX with rusty condition and not getting a proper help from Ford. I would request all of you who has this vehicle go and check if you have such issues for safer side otherwise it will be too late to react.
lincoln,mkx,2013,Cairnmomma , 09/21/2019,Nothing but problems!,1,"I bought a 2013 MKX with 3,000 miles on it. I have regretted it since day one. First, the fuel gauge would not read correctly, then the moon roof stopped working (all within the first 6 months.) When I put gas in it, if you do not immediately drive it, it will shudder, shake, check oil light pops on and then the whole car shuts down. This is terribly inconvenient when you fill up, then get stuck at a red light! Then the dashboard intermittently stops working, so I cannot see my control panel and have no idea how much gas I have. The navigation worked intermittently for a while, but has officially died as well. Now the rear windows won't roll down and the brakes are making a horrendous noise. The digital control panel was always fickle. It only has 38,000 miles on it, but I can't stand it any longer. I am looking to trade it for a highlander. Toyota has always been dependable for me. I will never touch another Lincoln or Ford again."
lincoln,mkx,2013,medic2012, 12/27/2012,Poor experience from Lincoln,2,I had bought a 2013 MKX from Planet Lincoln. The vehicle had a lot of interior noise from the road and surroundings. I was told by the service manager that this was normal. I went back to the sales associate and explained that I was not satisfied with the noise the response I got was too bad there is nothing we can do for you. Very pricey for a sub par vehicle

lincoln,mkx,2013,sloanbj, 12/18/2013,Excrescence,1,"Lincoln was once a proud brand and builder of significant American luxury cars. The brand died altogether more than 20 years ago but Ford has not yet caught on to this news.

The MKX is an appalling vehicle. The exterior and interior design are both revolting and non-functional. This is Ford Edge remodeled by Stevie Wonder. It is beyond me how, in 2013, a carmaker could offer such a poor design. For example, none of the buttons or switches inside are logically placed or obvious to use. Buttons on the steering wheel require removing your hands to access. Buttons are the dash are microscopically small and usually take many attempts to operate. The touch screen is just a mess. "

lincoln,mkx,2013,aaayron, 07/27/2013,Never Lease From Lincoln,3,"It's a bad idea to lease anything from Lincoln. Did you know that at the end of your lincoln lease, if you want to trade in your lincoln to anyone else but Lincoln, they will not release the car to anyone but you (the lessee) or a Lincoln dealer. I found this out the hard way today when i went to trade my leased Lincoln in for a cadilac. The cadilac dealership was giving me a good price that would have covered the payoff and the last 3 payments on my lease, but they would not allow cadillac to buy the car. being over my mileage, I could have avoided the mileage fees, excess wear and the last 3 payments. Now i have to use half my down payment i set asside just to get out of my lease."

lincoln,mkx,2014,Daniel Bray, 12/03/2016,High Luxury Not High Price,5,"We bought a 2 yr old MKX after owning Japanese cars for 16 years. So far it's better than we imagined in all areas. Powerful, smooth, quiet with all of the features we could ask for.  After owning it for a year, I can say that the navigation system is very complicated.  Unnecessarily so.  And the turn signals are overthought.  Too complicated for such a simple function.  But we still love the car."

lincoln,mkx,2014,Bob M, 05/07/2019,Best car we've owned,5,"The 2014 MKX we now own is our second MKX. After going to dinner with the pastor and his wife a few years ago in their MKX, my wife wanted one. We bought a 2009 one owner and put over 50k miles on it totally trouble free. We had no intention of buying another anytime soon, but saw the '14 on a local dealers lot. Loaded with ever options available except AWD, the condition, color and price was too good to pass up. We sold the '09 to a family member who loved it, and bought the '14.
We love the '14. The navigation can be a bit frustrating, and I'm not fond of having to pay to update it. Otherwise, I cannot think of any thing we don't like about the car. Decent fuel mileage, amazing ride and comfort, and a good value, especially if you buy it used as we did. I suspect that we will remain a Lincoln family as long as they make amazing small SUVs like this."

lincoln,mkx,2016,Happy in Florida, 05/14/2016,Didn't Want to Give it Back!,5,"I first came in contact with the 2016 Lincoln MKX in Albuquerque, NM. We had rented a full-size sedan, but were offered the MKX instead. We agreed and fell in love. I had rented suvs in the past, but had never owned one and never thought I would. I've always been a luxury car guy.  We drove the MKX around town for 9 days and were very reluctant to turn it in. My wife and I joked about driving it back to Florida instead of flying. We could find no faults. When we returned home, I began my quest for a new suv since we had become believers. I considered Lincoln, BMW, Jaguar, Range Rover and Cadillac. We researched and test drove all. Everything considered, we easily chose the MKX, not only for best value, but we also just liked it better than the others. We ended up with one identical to the one we had rented - white with cappuccino interior, 3.7 liter, Reserve level.  We recently returned from a 1,500-mile road trip, had no problems and are even more pleased.  After 1 1/2 months and a total of 1,650 miles, we know we made the right decision.

Nothing beats its styling, interior or exterior, I got the blue with terra cotta interior, beautiful.  Sticker  was 52,500 , selling price with dealer discount and rebates was 47,500. No problems . base engine has more than adequate power expecially in sport mode.  Most comfortable car I've ever owned. ""experts"" say its best as a highway cruiser, but I say it also handles curves very well in sport mode with little drop in ride comfort.  Excellent base revel stereo. Lane control works well but I like to keep the steering vibration alert off. Don't believe experts biased toward imports, they probably think its hip to downplay American luxury.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Carrie, 09/08/2016,"Give American made a chance, like we did.",4,"We are very happy with our 2016 MKX Black Label, former Lexus/Acura owners of many years. Test drove Infiniti's(multiple SUV's), Lexus RX, Acura MDX ... RDX, Mercedes GLK and GLE...also Audi Q5. We then decided to check out the 2016 Lincoln MKX. All the previously mentioned vehicle's are very nice but found the MKX much quieter, a joy to drive and the REVEL sound system may be better then the Mark Levinson sound system found in the RX. The REVEL blew my mind at the pure sound.  We were also very pleased with the softer ride and rarely any engine noise which were very noticeable in the RX, Mercedes and most especially the Infinit (QX50, JX60 and the small Infiniti SUV). The MKX is the most wonderful ride we have ever experienced. I rarely hear any rode noise or the sound of vehicle right next to us...due to the noise cancellation found thru-out the MKX. The seats in the Black Label are 22 way both driver and passenger side. The head room is great. My husband is 6'7"" and this and the Mercedes were the roomiest and most comfortable for him. The back seat is quite roomy as is the cargo area. We have the new SYNC 3 which is very easy to operate and I find it easy to figure out and operate.  My only complaint is the gas mileage which is normal for an SUV of almost 4500 lbs(18 miles to the gallon our tech informed us). I am a former owner of the Lexus GS sedan(10 years) and there is quite a difference in gas usage. This vehicle is pure joy to drive. We find ourselves wanting to use it on weekends now versus my husband's truck.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Brian, 05/07/2016,"Excellent, Comfortable and Quiet Vehicle",5,"This is literally my 5th Lincoln having previously owned a Navigator and past 5 years, MKX's. I just leased the new 2016 all white with cappuccino interior, Reserve. It is completely redesigned from my prior 2014 Lincoln MKX. The vehicle is stunning having cooled seats, heated seats and one of the best quality stereo systems I have ever heard. My wife has a ML350 Mercedes and she pays more per month than I do and my MKX has significantly more features and; better quality features. The back seats are significantly larger and roomier than my prior 2014 Lincoln MKX. The driving is superior and my favorite feature of this vehicle is the extremely quiet cabin. Going 80 mph on the highway, you can hear a pin drop. I am a Trial Attorney in Miami and I am constantly driving all throughout town. This vehicle is nothing but exceptional. I will continue buying Lincoln forever so long as they keep the great job. Keep in mind, for the price you get a huge amount of technology and more so than most finer vehicles including Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar and Acuras. Consider this vehicle and you won't be disappointed, I promise!

lincoln,mkx,2016,Bob, 12/24/2015,ALL prior model drawback have gone away!!!!,5,"This one has all of the technology available on all luxury SUZ on the market at far less price. The quality is excellent. All of the drawbacks of the prior version have been fixed.. Now has much smoother ride, better steering/handling, update look, comfortable drivers seat and steering wheel positions and adjustments. 360 degrees cameras, collision alerts, blind spot alerts, cross traffic alerts and adaptable cruise control are all musts in my judgment. And for those who like ""toys"", the ambient interior lighting choices are a fun thing. I have never like a vehicle as much. Seeing is believing....LOL, I sound like a Lincoln salesmen, but the car is just that good!!!!
"
lincoln,mkx,2016,cfmillette, 08/10/2016,Brand new Purchase: updated,5,"OK: After researching on the Internet, and having my wife look at/drive other competitors: she decided to buy a 2016 MKX - yesterday.  So this review is very early on indeed. However: the car rides very capably and the cabin is very quiet. [I drive a sports sedan aggressively, but here the standard 3.7L V6 is fine] - we opted instead of the 2.7L Turbo engine for both the Driver Assistance and the Technology packages. Forget  the earlier Ford ""My Touch"" - the newer SCYN3 interface seems pretty intuitive. Does this car warrant the added cost compared to its ""parent"" the lower cost Ford Edge? Do not know yet, obviously. But the ambience of the driver's cabin is entirely comparable to the Lexus RX-350, the new Cadillac XT5 et.al. We decided that, yep, the cachet of the Lincoln ""name"" was worth the cost. Note please: we are an older couple with disposable income, at least to a degree. Pure economy or ecological ""Green"" thinking issues are not highly weighted in our household.

Regarding my comment regarding ""Green"" thinking! Yes, if my wife and I valued this aspect to the exclusion of all else - we would both be driving a Toyota Yaris or something akin. Nope, not going to happen at this point. Plus, I have made the following calculation: 18 mpg/driving 10,000 mpy (our situation) equates to something like 556 gallons of gasoline per year. Buying instead a car with predicted 22 mpg and driving the same 10,000 may, but using premium gas? In our neighborhood based upon local gasoline pricing, this means that we SAVE about $50/year. In other words totally inconsequential.

Now with 500 miles driven - we love this car. Optional safety features work exactly as advertised and already have been appreciated.

Do not need a third row? Less interested in sports car experience (I get that elsewhere!)? Want comfort and safety? Willing to buy American? Consider the newest version of the Lincoln MKX.

UPDATE: Now about 6 months later, still very few miles driven, but we remain entirely pleased. While there have been two recalls, but both of these were for very minor issues, nothing at all substantive. Dealership completely responsive.Interior space very conveniently organized. We very much like the front console ""pass-through""storage space created by the push button gear selector. Gas milage exactly as predicted. Many positive comments from passengers. SYNC-3 easy to use. 360 degree camera system excellent. Oh yeah, that night-time illuminated Lincoln logo Welcome Mat? While simply pure fluff and decadence, we never fail to use it when chaperoning new guests at night! Starts the conversation going immediately.


Overall, my initial rating remains unchanged. This has been an excellent choice for us.

Most recent update. Now with another 6 months or so experience? Our review remains unaltered. Excellent driving machine for our needs. Good engine performance, superb comfort and internal ambience (SYNC3 system), good storage capacity , not at all missing a third row seating which we did NOT need initially, safety bells /whistles have indeed been helpful. My wife and I recommend this vehicle without reservation.
"
lincoln,mkx,2016,Dan H, 07/22/2016,Happy Wife / Happy Life,5,"My wife didn't like the exterior/interior combinations on dealer lots so we ordered our MKX and waited 7 weeks for delivery. We ordered Allure Blue w/ cappuccino interior. We are glad we waited. We drove Acura and Lexus before selecting Lincoln. We loved both the Acura RDX and MKX. Not so much for the Lexus 350. We selected the Lincoln based on two bad experiences with Honda products. My daughter hopped a curb while pulling away from a bank ATM and did $3500 damage to her Accord and my son totaled his RL without hitting anything by running off a highway into the median. I've done similar things with Ford products without any damage to suspension systems. My wife is driving the MKX and I have taken her 2001 Toyota Sienna and made it my work car. Our MKX is fairly tricked-out. The features I especially love are: adaptive cruise control (won't buy another car without it), 360 degree backup camera (Toyota calls this bird's eye view and I won't buy another car without it), rain sensing wipers, automatic on/off-high/low headlights, 2.7L engine (very smooth at moderate acceleration). My wife loves the power tailgate, seat adjustment capability (we have premium seats that allow increasing/decreasing the length of the lower cushion that allows adjustment to shorter/taller people) and the automatic synchronization with her iPhone that plays her playlist music (she is a classical pianist) anytime she enters the car rather than defaulting to the radio. We recently drove from Charleston, SC to Baton Rouge, LA. I historically hate drives longer than 10 hours. That drive, I think I could have continued to Houston. We will be taking the car in for its 5000 mile service next week. My wife and I typically expect 250,000 miles from a car so we'll be driving this one for a while. The only option that I didn't get that I might consider next time is the adaptive steering - I have to hold the steering wheel with two hands when nailing the throttle. Either the adaptive steering or AWD might help with the torque steer.
"
lincoln,mkx,2016,Michelle, 06/24/2016,I would not buy this car...it is unreliable,3,"This care is so comfortable and drives fantastic... BUT do not let them sell you on the My Touch navigation system.  They are moving all this year to Sync 3 which is great but are still selling early 2016 models with My Touch - It is frustrating, slow and will leave you stranded. I had a loaner with the Sync 3 and it was night and day.  I love this car but I bet I will get rid of it within 3 years due to the navigation system....It takes forever to compute and randomly the keyboard just disappears. I have taken it in and they can't do anything about it... I would recommend this car to anyone as long as you don't get suckered into the old nav system.
I do have to say that the service folks and Gwinnett Lincoln have been a pleasure to deal with. I do wish the Lincoln dealership/Service was  completely separate from Ford due to it is very busy but the staff does go above and beyond.
12/26/16 updated review - the car has been in the shop 7 time in less than 9K mile  for various forms of issues. Twice for throttle rod where the car just dies in traffic and then will only go 5 mph which is extremely dangerous in ATL traffic.  The computer is this car is buggy - errors show up on the dash and I take pics with my cell and then Lincoln can not replicate it. The lift gate sensors are unpredictable and come down on you for no reason.  I would never purchase this car again due to the computer system...It is great when it wants to work. The navigation system still blacks out for no reason.  It still drives like a dream and is very comfortable, I love all the cameras to park, back up etc. The other think I absolutely hate is since I spend so much time at the Lincoln service center is that it is also mixed with the Gwinnett ford dealership and therefore it is always chaotic. If you want to buy a luxury car then my advice is to avoid this car and also go with someone that has a stand alone dealership and is has a longer time in the marketplace - Maybe 2017 they will get the bugs worked out. I did not pay 50K plus for a car that I have to drive 45 min each way to the dealership every other week to drive a loaner.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Chris Johnson, 09/02/2016,2016 2.7L Turbo-Good Stuff~She's fully Loaded too.,5,"Drove two Lincoln MKX engines, the 3.7 and the 2.7 turbo.  Drove the Lexus RX 350 Sport & Premium.  Drove all lines of the Jaguar F-Pace.  Drove the Ford Edge Sport.   Drove Audi's line.  Drove Acura MDX.........I bought the 2.7L MKX.   Frankly, I like every one of various manufacturers offerings.  Honestly, you can't go wrong no matter what, we all live in the age of cool factor and quality overall.  But what I wanted was the blend of comfort and dead quiet cabin, with a serious engine, and the 2.7L MKX fits the bill the best of everything I drove.   The 3.7 MKX is fine, but seems a bit under powered to me.  The 2.7, is a serious motor and for a car guy/gal, this will be worth the extra bucks.  It just hauls when you need it, there is zero turbo lag, it's there, it's on, this is one very fast vehicle when the moment dictates.    We have a fully loaded vehicle, you can't put a single option more on it.   But if I could do it all again, I'd opt for the 20's, rather than the 21 inch rims, I'm just too nervous I'll scrape them when parallel parking, but the cameras all around, surely help in all aspects.   Some niggly items that are a bit hard to get used to for me, I continue to phantom on the parking break with my left leg, the pull the button break thing will take some more getting used too.   And the ""push matic"" gear selection, it's just a bit laggy between gear changes.   Some things I've learned quickly in ownership here is that most folks probably will back off on some of the safety settings, otherwise you'll fight the car for control.  It'll beep at you, flash at you, and literally steer for you, which is all good, for some, not for me.  I've dialed back the settings to suit my needs.   The steering wheel thing in full safety mode is a bit disconcerting if you even drift a hair from dead center in your lane.   My favorite part of all though is the gas pedal and the 2.7 Turbo, I can just accelerate to match anything on the road, at any speed. Favorite  part for my wife is the massaging seats, she's happy, I'm happy, and we cruise down the road in style, only 50 years young, and chuckling that my grandparents in their 70's had a Lincoln!

Update.........fit and finish still excellent, nothing further to report at this time.  Great engine!

Final Update, sold it to buy an Alfa Romeo.   Had a great experience with the Lincoln, will seriously look at them again.    Lincoln just was in a weird inventory transition time to the Nautilus, and I couldn't get the specs I wanted, which is basically fully loaded.  In the 3 years of owning this, there really is only one gripe, and it's the handling.   After driving all the 2019 models at hand, all manufacturers seemed to have made handling better yet.  Lincoln seemed stuck in 2016, which is still a good ride, but just not really fully composed for maybe more spirited driving for lack of a better term.  But that 2.7 Twin Turbo, she pulls like a freight train and I think it's a terrific engine.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Andrew, 12/15/2016,2.7L AWD Reserve,5,"Excellent vehicle, I have had it now for over 6 months with no issues. I got the AWD 2.7L which is considerably faster than the standard stock engine. Also make sure to get AWD as it makes a big difference in the comfort and performance of the vehicle. Only note is that your MPG will suffer. I drive aggressively and get an average of 18.7mpg. Also id recommend to get the tan interior vs the black as it is more appealing. Also the 360 camera system is useful in parking so you avoid scratching up those rims. Sound options are nice as well and If you equip it right you get lots of other features such as lane departure. Lastly I have the new sync 3 which works considerably better than the old sync my touch. Overall great vehicle worth taking for a test drive.

lincoln,mkx,2016,hrbaltd@me.com, 12/30/2015,My MKX Reserve turned out to be a lemon. Avoid.,3,"UPDATE:  The vehicle has been a mechanical nightmare.  The transmission went after 12,000!  In less than 3 years, I had to replace the battery, both catalytic converts, a throttle body injector system, and am now on my 3rd set of tires!  Lease just ended thank goodness.  It was a real lemon of a vehicle.  Just leased a 2019 Jaguar F Pace S.  So far so good but it is too early to tell on it's reliability.  It does come with a 45 year/50,000 bumper to bumper warranty.  Picked up my 2016 MKX Reserve last week and all I can say is the vehicle turned out to be a total lemon.  It is very fast (2.7 twin turbo option) and somewhat nimble (in sport mode).  The optional massaging seats makes any long drive a pleasure.  Be sure to order this option.  It is worth every penny.   The vehicle is quiet but in sport mode, you can hear the exhaust kick in when you punch it.  People that have ridden in the vehicle with me comment on how quiet the ride is.  The vehicle is good in the snow.  The overall reliability has been poor.    The Revel sound system (basic Revel upgrade, not the 4k upgrade) is phenomenal and better than my prior Bose system.   Note that the vehicle came from the factory with the Sync 3 system.  That system became very problematic over time.  This car turned out to be a total disappointment and repair nightmare.  Buyer beware.

lincoln,mkx,2016,carled63, 07/03/2016,X Marks the Spot,5,"I love my 2016 Lincoln MKX Reserve.  I looked a lot for a compact SUV that would have pedestrian alert and a 5-star IIHS safety rating.  I also preferred one that had a lot of American content.  I just could not find one that met my needs, and the ones that came closest--TBH--felt kind of cramped.  I almost went with the MKC--a little concerned on size and very disappointed it did not have pedestrian alert.  Then the salesman pointed out that the MKX had the 5-star rating with top-of-the-line pedestrian alert.  In 5 minutes I decided to go for it, and I have not been disappointed!  

The car looks great--inside and out.  I think the materials and look of the inside, in particular, are very high end.  I also love driving the car; it is super quiet and smooth with very competent handling.  

I went with Reserve but skipped the Revel stereo, the 2.7 L turbo and the 22-position seats.  Those all sound nice, but they add a lot to the price, and I am not that picky.  I don't regret those choices.  The premium (i.e., standard) stereo is fine.  I did find that setting the option to adjust the volume with your speed helps a lot.  I also think the 3.7 L base engine has plenty of power and is very smooth.  Also, the standard seats are super comfortable with plenty of adjustments--recline, height, lumbar, thigh support, etc.  I also like the extra space of the mid-size SUV vs. a compact.  There are so many times I would cram stuff in the back of my last compact SUV, and I am finding it a surprising relief to have the extra space that a mid-size provides.   

Lincoln has also delighted me once or twice.  For example, the cooled front seats are great on hot days.  The power steering wheel adjustment made me smile too.  And I enjoyed how simple the technology has been to set up.  My car has Sync 3, and it is both easy to set up and is very intuitive to operate.  

My only slight disappointment is the gas mileage.  It is more or less as advertised--and that is lower than with most compacts.  That is the price you pay for space.
"
lincoln,mkx,2016,Author, 03/25/2017,"Almost, but not quite there",4,"In full disclosure, this is my third MKX. I also had an Edge. It's been a year in so I have an informed knowledge of this vehicle. The positives: It's super quiet. It has an excellent ride yet takes a corner well. The overall look is nice though I will not miss the mustache grill. Power from the base engine is adequate. The kick open for the hatch works well. Sync 3 is an improvement and the Sirius works better than previously. Value for lease price is excellent. The negatives: The shifter on the stack should have haptic feedback. More than once I was in the wrong gear from not touching it hard enough. The interior still lacks a luxurious, high-quality feel. The buttons look Ford-esque. If you want to play in this league it takes more. I recently tried charging my phone and couldn't find the port. I know they are there but not in a convenient place. Observations: Fit and finish is nice but I have a loose trim plate.  Gas mileage is below the sticker but that's to be expected. The older MKX had much better sight lines. Pillars by the windshield are thick. I recommend this vehicle.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Rick, 07/04/2016,Lincoln's Luxury with small issues,4,"I still am experiencing some small issues with some of the electronic components of the MKX that require continued service attention.  They are not major issues and are done while getting regular routine service.  I have had several problems with the heated seats and most recently my key less entry system that just went out for some reason.  The dealership has finally solved the heated seats issue and I have to admit that I still absolutely love this vehicle.  We just purchased an 2018 Audi A6 sedan for my wife and it was priced significantly higher that the Lincoln and doesn't have half of the safety features that the MKX has.  The comfort and quietness of the cabin on the Lincoln is much more than that of the Audi.  We currently average approximately 24 mpg while traveling the interstate and 19 mpg around town.  I would still recommend that people check out the Lincoln and they may be pleasantly surprised. 

2019.....Update...still loving the Lincoln MKX ....we traveled from the East coast to the West coast last winter and it continued to reinforce my previous ratings regarding comfort, performance and safety.  It is my plans to consider purchasing another one in the near future..

lincoln,mkx,2016,BILL FRONAPFEL, 10/28/2016,great ride,5,"I have owned many new and used cars in my 50 years of driving. I have owned Lincoln town cars and you could not kill if you did regular maintenance. Since 1987 I have owned only SUVs and crossovers and the MKX is simply the best ever. All controls can be be done any of 3 ways; from steering wheal, voice, and by hand and all controls on the dash are very easy to reach. The only complaint I have is the back trunk cover its not easy to close and I can't seam to get the trunk open with my foot under the car my wife has some trouble. Over all the Best car I ever had.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Linda Wright, 02/27/2017,I bleed Lincoln!,5,"It has been three years  since I posted the below review of my vehicle, and really nothing has change. Only issue you I had was needing 4 new tires, due to new housing sub division being built in the are that I live.I had a issue with my battery twice, took it to the dealer and the battery was fine. No reason as to why the car just died and wouldn't start.  

My previous review: This vehicle is awesome, such a comfortable ride, such smooth handling and such a quiet engine.  The looks of the SUV is so classy and it has and so many bells and whistle, that I am still learning them. Now I know why Matthew McConaughey agrees to advertise the vehicles, it is not for the money but the Lincolns are a quality vehicle and I do not not just stare at my vehicle, I drive it.
"
lincoln,mkx,2016,Todd, 02/20/2016,a must see,5,"A three year update. The car continues to drive very well. Sync 3 and all the other electronics (blis, etc) continue to impress. The car rides perfectly and I’m still reminded daily of how comfortable the seats are. Everyone who has ridden in the car is impressed.

Maintenance has been easy and it is nice to no longer be paying BMW maintenance fees. Issues so far have been small with one of the folding rear view mirrors requiring serve and a vacuum valve that needed replacement. 

I recently looked at the MB GLS as I’m tempted to get a third row but I think the MB disappoints on interior comfort and electronic options even at a much higher price compared to the Lincoln. I’m going to hold onto the MKX a while longer.
"
lincoln,mkx,2016,David, 09/09/2016,Ups and downs,3,"The upsides to the car: Handles and accelerates beautifully.  I have the 2.7L ecoboost and the 21 inch rims.  Power if plentiful, ride is smooth, and it handles like a much smaller sedan.   Its a driver's vehicle and oozes competence on the road. I like most of the tech features a lot, and after my last vehicle (A BMW), I'm glad to be looking at a sensibly laid-out touchscreen.  All the parking aids and such are wonderful and the stereo sounds great.  Lincoln has also been great, and I've been really happy with the dealer support.  The downsides: Even with the 22-way adjustable seat (which actually only adjusts in 7 or 8 different ways), I just can't get comfortable.  The seats crane my neck forward and the bottom seat bolsters dig into my thighs.  The ergonomics of the car are kind of a mess - as an example, the seat controls are silly complex, with multiple pull down menus and four or five different buttons.  The transmission controls are on the dash, but that doesn't wind up freeing up any usable space - you get this goofy under console shelf that is barely usable. And, too bad if you want to power your phone - the power source is at the bottom of the dash and certainly impossible to reach unless you stop the car and bend down low.   Some of the features just don't work very well: waving your foot under the back bumper rarely opens the back the first time, and the air cooled seats aren't really very cool.   MPG is abysmal (although nobody lied to me about that one - I knew that going in) and the visibility out back is atrocious.  Somewhere in the middle:  The fit and finish overall is very good, and the materials are mostly nice.  For example, the leather on the seats is high quality.  But, there are some hard cheap plastics in the interior.  Feels real upscale to me, but I never owned a Lexus or Mercedes.  I'm not entirely sure Lincoln has hit the lofty objective of competing with Lexus.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Harold, 11/03/2015,Love my 2016 Lincoln MKX Reserve,5,"Purchased the MKX Reserve on October 13, 2015.  As of this writing, November 3, 2015, I have had no problems or issues.  This vehicle is loaded with technology and as of this writing I'm still learning.  Pairing (sync) my iphone 6 with this vehicle was no problem.  Very happy   with my MKX Reserve.  UPDATE:  November 4, 2016 best vehicle purchase I have ever made and I will be Seventy next week.  UPDATE:  May 4, 2017---I continue to be extremely pleased with this vehicle.  I've done a bit of traveling recently.  This vehicle is a dream to drive and comfort is excellent.  Only change I would make would be to go with 20-1/2"" wheels instead of 20"" wheels.  UPDATE:  I continue to travel and enjoy the comfort of my MKX Reserve.  My prior comments still stand today.  This is without a doubt one of my best vehicle purchases.

lincoln,mkx,2016,debbie harwood, 03/21/2016,Buyer Beware!!,2,"I purchased the MKX in Oct. 2015. Loved the car until it stalled on the freeway in traffic with only 2200 miles on it.  It has now stalled 2 more times with trips to the dealer and no definitive answers. They have called technical support and re calibrated RPMS and replaced temperature sensors. This is a brand new car with only 3800 miles. Hugh mistake and disappointment in Lincoln Customer service and Dealership.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Pete R, 09/03/2019,This is a wonderful SUV that's luxurious and fun!,5,"I recently purchased a 2016 MKX Reserve with 31K miles, and I couldn't be happier.  This is one of the best cars I've ever owned, and I've owned a lot of cars over the years!  First, if you're looking at a 2016, be sure to get one with SYNC3.  Earlier production models in 2016 still have the original SYNC, but SYNC3 is more responsive and overall vastly superior.  I have been looking at the MKX since the current iteration was released for the 2016 model year.  I've test driven a few and always been impressed.  But, I've always purchased Japanese cars and held off on the MKX because I was discouraged by some reports of poor reliability.  So far, I haven't had any problems, although it's only been two weeks and 500 miles.  The owner reviews here on Edmund's finally convinced me to take the plunge and get my own MKX.  I'm so glad I did.  I love driving it.  It's comfortable, quiet, responsive and laden with high-tech and helpful features.  Some of my favorite features are the ambient lighting (just beautiful), the hands-free liftgate, the air conditioned seats (much more effective than ventilated seats), and the optional Revel sound system (simply awesome sound)!  I've been averaging about 21 MPG, which is higher than the EPA estimate of 19.  Mine is Lincoln Certified, so it has the remainder of the original 4 Year/50K warranty for another year, as well as the Certified warranty for an additional two years or up to 100K, with a $100 deductible.  That gives me some peace of mind.  I traded in a one year old Subaru Outback Touring with 12K miles, which I bought new, in order to buy the MKX.  The Subaru was very nice, but I wanted more luxury features, specifically a better sound system, ambient lighting and the AC seats.  I'm so happy I made the trade.  As I said, I couldn't be happier with my MKX and I highly recommend it to others!
08/26/20 UPDATE:  I still love my MKX.  It's been one year and another 8K miles of driving enjoyment.  I'm consistently getting 20 - 22mpg, which is higher than the EPA estimate of 19, and that's on regular gas.  I love the sound of the exhaust and engine...hard to describe, but I'd call it low and sporty.  I love all the different lights, especially the ambient lighting which still delights my passengers and me.  I've had one routine service which cost $90.  There was also a recall for a battery issue and a loose driver's seat, both fixed at no charge.  I usually get bored with my cars after about six months, but I'm still loving my MKX!

lincoln,mkx,2016,Kathy Davis, 04/24/2016,Lemon Law Applies,1,"A 62k piece of junk.  Right front running light went out before owning the car 2MONTHS.  It has been the  dealer SIX times and they can not fix it.  In additional to that I have had many, many, many electrical problems with this car.  The odometer has disappeared, the left turn signal light comes on when I have not activated it, the radio turns on all by itself, I get a gray shadow of the car on the center screen at the end of my driveway and the indicator alerts me with a red light, front left always, when I'm in the middle of a double wide driveway (this has happened too many times to count) , back windshield wiper turns on by itself, once after leaving the dealership I had a repeating message about Pre Collision Assist Not Available & Service AdvnceTrac in a constant loop until I turned off the car.  Ford has been unable to duplicate all of the issues even after given proof of.  I was told that the 2016 has a new Sync System and that could be part of the reason. I have had to contact an attorney and file a Lemon Law Suit against Ford as they just want to keep trying to ""fix"" the issues.  Extremely disappointed in Ford.  Should have bought another Lexus - I never had one problem with my RX330 in 12 years!

lincoln,mkx,2016,Vette Owner, 10/06/2018,"Smooth, Attractive & Comfortable",4,"The MKX Reserve with the 2.7 turbo V6 and just about every option available represents the perfect SUV that rides comfortably - which is what you want a people mover to do rather the harsh rides of several “sportier” competitors.  It has been a trouble free 23,000 miles thus far.  Only complaints would be to have better tires than the standard Hankooks and better quality plastics on the center console.  The rest of the vehicle is solid with very good quality materials and build.  I have been impressed with it after owning Mercedes, Audi, Cadillac and Audi products and will consider the new Nautilus when it comes time to turn the MKX in.

Warranty replaced. Quiet for a while but a year later it’s coming back. I like the exterior design. Best A/C in any car yet. I’m not in love with the push button shifter. Blind spot monitor, adaptive cruise control and 360 cameras are must haves from this point forward. Console cup holders are awkward. Seats could be softer. Quiet ride. I miss the roominess of my Buick Enclave but the tech devices on the MKX made this a fairly good choice.

However, there is NO  place to set my purse. If you are a man this won't be a problem. Another thing to consider is the fact that the trade in value is VERY poor.

lincoln,mkx,2016,TeeVee, 03/23/2020,My Wife Bought Seats,5,"This car is so comfortable my wife and I drove from Birmingham, Alabama to Ventura, Calif. stopping only for gas and food. 30 hours in the saddle splitting the driver responsibilities. The back end and back seat were loaded full of stuff so we could only recline the front seat slightly to nap. Didn't matter. We never felt out of sorts. The main reason she bought this vehicle was for the seats. She sat in about 15 other similar cars but bought the Lincoln because it had ""the most comfortable seats.""  It has enough power on tap (305 hp) to do anything (within reason) including 80 - 90 mph on those long deserted freeways without flinching. Handles and drives really well in any city situation. Much better than I expected from a Lincoln.
So far not one repair required (52,000 miles). Not even tires. Only routine oil changes. 
If you are in the market for something comfortable you owe it to youself, and your deriere, to at least ""sit"" in one before you buy anything."
lincoln,mkx,2016,Noname, 07/27/2018,Land Turd,2,"Well, I just got rid of my 2016 Lincoln MKX. Here are the reasons why: 1. Driver side seat kept moving on its own for no reason...really 2. Very bad pick-up. I must have had a car with some sort of transmission problem that no one could ever find, but stepping on the gas would almost make the car stall. This was a tempermental problem. Some days it would be fine. Forget about passing someone on the highway on a Lincoln bad day. 3. When I changed gears from park to drive or park to reverse, the radio would go on 4. Computer would freeze unpredictably even when driving. 5. I have been a driver of many different cars and I know how to defrost a windshield. It was impossible to get the defrost to actually do its job. Did not matter setting,heat,AC,windows open, windows closed, recycle. Nothing worked. I had to literally use my hand to wipe the condensation to avoid getting into an accident. 6. Heating system is not balanced regardless of setting.. In winter, your feet would be on fire and you would freeze your face off. 7. Would constantly throw codes, which would magically disappear without a trace. After many trips to the dealer, and their inability to find any problems, I gave up. Gone!

I thought I'd try the MKX as a change from last two MKZ's. This is proving to be a huge disappointment. I have most every option you can get and that still does not change things. My MKX is 8 months old with only 5,000 miles on it. I have had nothing but quirky and annoying problems. While driving at night the ""Service Headlamps Light"" came on and then they quit working minutes later. I drove home with only the parking lamps on. The dealer reset the computer and they worked again. Since then that warning light has come on briefly and then gone back off. I've taken it back and they can find any fault codes stored in the computer. The carpeting has pulled away from the sills on two of the four doors. I had a very annoying rattle in the all glass moon roof. It took the dealer a week to pinpoint and repair. Also I will get exhaust fumes in the cabin when I need to accelerate quickly. The dealer changed the cabin air filter, that did nothing. The most annoying thing and something they are aware of is that hood flexes while driving on the highway. You can actually see it moving. I am afraid it's going to weaken the latch and come loose while driving. They said the flexing is because the hood is fiberglass?? I've owned many cars, expensive and inexpensive ones. Not one of them ever had a hood that flexed. The dealer has assured me that the hood will not come open, I am not convinced. An almost $60,000 vehicle should not have this issue or any other issues like I've experienced. For those of you who own a 2016/2017 MKX watch your hood as you go down the highway and you'll see what I am talking about. Hopefully the 2018 MKX went back to the drawing board before they began production?

Back seat comfort is marginal at best and the glass roof impedes head room.  Mileage on my AWD is terrible at 17.  Infotainment is better with Sync3 but still not on par with the competition by any means.  It SCARES me to think that with such poor electronics now, Ford is actually considering driverless vehicles in the future.  We will all perish!    The interior has cheap materials that are not very well thought through.  There is no sliding rear seat and for the money their should be.  The front is cramped with their huge console and the cargo area is chopped by the sloping hatch and drooping roofline.  The 2.7L engine has good pull but terrible fuel economy and only a 6 speed auto transmission.  Options are expensive on this vehicle.  To get led headlamps and a subpar stereo will cost $4,400 and it is not by any means best in class!   This is clearly NOT a well thought out vehicle and NOT worth the money.

We test drove the usual suspects, the RX350, Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, but kept coming back to the MDX because of its powerful 2.7L Ecoboost engine, generous cabin space,  Sync 3 (Do not get the older version of Sync), as the Sync  3 is fantastic and quite intuitive.  The 4 year warranty made us feel better about buying American.  We have had our MDX for a month now and love it!  We will be taking it on a long road trip soon and we will report back about how the MDX performed. Cons: Gulps down fuel and seem to always be filling it up.

The car would slide in the snow and it couldn’t go up hills. Then the gps went right in the middle of my trip.

lincoln,mkx,2016,Gary, 07/22/2020,so you think PB start is COOL huh?!,3,"This is a very nice car with loads and loads of little doodads. It's nice to have a lot of choices in user interface, on cars with lots of features, no doubt!  However,,, when this new concept of push button start as opposed to using a key which is intentionally placed within its slot and manipulated by your fingers and not mistakeable for some other push button, or easily ""brushed"", well, there's quite a difference! After having shut off my car while driving down the street on a couple of occasions now within my first 24 hours of ownership I'd have to say that Lincoln didn't quite get this one right!!! (at least not in model year 2016!) I won't go on endlessly here but push buttons and all sorts of touchscreen HMI are by no means foreign to this operator.  I know all about that stuff and get paid good money professionally to do that sort of thing. Let's just say that Lincoln shouldn't have put this one out. I suppose being an old man you'll never convince me that keyless start is smart but I'm okay with it as long as it's not hazardous.

After a few weeks of ownership, I must say the thing IS QUIET!  Not quite like a 70s Continental, but quieter than any of the competition that I'm aware of. (Too bad they won't take just a couple more steps to get that old Lincoln dead-silent interior) Smooooothe too! And I should warn anyone wanting to maintain impartiality and detachment in their selection process, DONT test this one at the end of a day, and try the 22-way adjustable seats, and hit the MASSAGE function!  You won't want to buy it, YOU'LL WANT TO MARRY IT!

Still, Mr.Lincolns engineers and stylists should have built a better car.  Maybe they should all get their cars gas tanks sugared. The reason that, like Fords, Lincolns don't have a secured fuel point, is because some JERK, WAAAY up the ladder there has a bug up their ass.  The customers suffer for it.  Also, with the digital computing and data processing and display power this thing has, WHY CAN'T WE SEE ALL OF OUR POWER TRAIN AND CHASSIS CONDITIONS?  I'm talking engine temperature, oil pressure, oil temperature, battery charge and voltage levels, alternator current, time since last service, last alarms, tire pressure,,,,, for starters.  All the data is there. The operator and/or owner of the equipment deserves access to that info.

Is there a chip to load those functions? Can I update or select my preference of UI and software/firmware features? Why not?   While asking such tough but pertinent questions, why am I so much and so obviously better at knowing if and when to lock and unlock the doors and open or close the lift gate?  Why must I and the other riders have this ""just keep trying and it'll unlock /open once it figures you out"" mentality?

Then there's the dash configuration/shaping that keeps your stuff off of it, but little if any other convenient places exist. There's nowhere for your cellphone to sit, and let's just say that THIS Lincoln doesn't surpass or incorporate WAZE, Google maps, or better.

Right now, my old body is keeping me with the seats in this rig.  My tolerance for it's other shortcomings will undoubtedly improve.... (dammit!)

lincoln,mkx,2017,JohnC, 04/10/2017,2017 Lincoln MKX is a winner,5,"I purchased a 2017 Lincoln MKX a week ago and it surely is a pleasure to drive.   It has all the safety features including backup camera, warning on cars in other lanes, collision alert, and even will call 911 if the airbags deploy.   Since it is push button start and push button transmission a lot of space was made available for storage between the front seats including two ""pass thru"" storage bins.  The Sync 3 entertainment is excellent and is also voice activated as is the navigation system.   I really appreciate the radar weather maps which give ""in the moment"" maps of the local radar--very useful.  In summary, the Lincoln MKX is a joy to drive and extremely quiet in city traffic or on the road. Everything works perfectly including the liftgate which has multiple ways of opening it(including waging your foot under the bumper).   The 2017 Lincoln MKX is a true winner. 
After a year of ownership the MIX is greet.  No issues or problems. Everything works perfectly.  Just took it to dealership for annual maintenance service.  Everything checked out OK.

lincoln,mkx,2017,Celtic, 11/22/2017,Agile Cruiser with 5 Star Fit & Finish,5,"Every requirement I searched for in the upper Luxury segment was met or exceeded by the MKX. Its nice to be able to carry on a conversation without raising your voice. The visibility, quietness, comfortable seating and technological innovations are superlative. Driving the 2017 MKX is a pleasure, especially with the panoramic vista roof.

lincoln,mkx,2017,Peter G, 08/01/2017,2017 MKX is a awesome ride! I highly recommend!,5,"I looked all the SUV's from entry level to top level from all brands. This included , Acura, VW, Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Subaru, Lexus, Toyota, Nisan, Jaguar, BMW, Audi, Honda, etc.. None of them had the the full package at this price point. The technology, ride, luxury and performance. Some were close, like the new 2018 Audi. There are some really aggressive rebates and pricing so don't pay over invoice and get the 0% financing. I really enjoy driving this SUV. The one downside has been the MPG but I knew this going in after reading all the reviews. The performance is worth it and 20 MPG blended is not bad to have a twin turbo!
"
lincoln,mkx,2017,Jeff, 08/30/2017,Best car I've ever drove!!,5,"I got a terrific deal on this SUV. I looked at EVERYTHING out there and found this vehicle to be exactly what I wanted. Great power, very comfortable, great ride and plenty of storage. Nice paint and interior is fantastic . The Revel stereo is far beyond what I was looking for. My driving is all types, highways and city driving. My average MPG is 24.9 with regular gas. I've driven Infiniti, BMW, Buick, Ford, Chevy, Jeep and Nissan Suv, but nothing gave all the extras I was looking for at the price. I love this car!

lincoln,mkx,2017,dldibona@gmail.com, 12/12/2017,Buying American better than ever,5,"For the last 15 years we had Acura MDX's. Very disappointed with the Acura Dealer's arrogance and decided to look at other manufactures. The Lincoln Dealer listened to what we wanted and the MKX has everything we wanted. Great ride, performance, sound system, cargo space and styling. Excellent interface with the car and driver. Aggressive lease rates and an excellent warranty. We leased the Lincoln MKX over the Acura MKX, Lexus RX350, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Infinity Q60.

lincoln,mkx,2017,jean, 07/01/2017,I have moderate back issues and severe neck issues,3,"I bought this car for the 22 point adjustable seat.  It is great.  I can ride for an hour in most cars.  When the pain starts, I put on the massage seat! Gets me home pain free.  So very thankful. I must tell you the safety features are awesome.  I love the cruise control that slows down and speeds up based on the car in front of you. I also love the auto stop and heated steering wheel.  Honey I'm in heaven.  Basically, this car nearly drives itself and you sit back in the best seat every and enjoy the ride.  I've gone from hating to drive due to pain, to loving to drive.  Thank you! The electronics are a bit in need.  My windsheild wipers on intermittent go crazy and I've had a backup sensor go bad.  The control for massage on the passenger seat had to be replaced, but the dealer did it with no questions.
"
lincoln,mkx,2017,Larry reed, 05/11/2017,Great quiet ride,5,"Based on previous luxury SUVs this MKX IS quiet and the seats are a lot more comfortable. A pleasure to drive and easy to get used to control functions. Why can't all cruise controls be on same side of steering wheel. Love interior lights and outside lights. Cargo area spacious and easy to access with multiple features. Handling and mileage are equal to previous SUV or maybe a little better. It remains to be seen how dealership compares to other luxury dealership. Love the trim package and available off lot, always had to order our cars in in the past to get colors and options we required.

lincoln,mkx,2017,Cheryl Feinberg, 08/10/2017,Too Early to Tell,5,"My car has a little less than 300 miles on it, so in nearly every category it's just too early to tell how it will be.  My previous experience with my dealership and my 2008 Lincoln MKS was excellent.  My car lacks two items I wish it had.  1) Seat cooling.  I would have had to add $4k of extras I didn't want or need to get seat cooling.  It's important to note, however, that the AC in the car is excellent.  The second extra I miss is front warning beeps when I get near objects.  I did not realize that I didn't have that option until too late.
"
lincoln,mkx,2017,Phil, 01/21/2018,Great midsize luxury suv - zero issues,5,"We looked at every competitor and the MKX beat them out on features, value and overall driving experience. The list of things we like ranges from the Synch 3 system which is much superior to the Acura, BMW, and Audi, the quiet interior, seat comfort (we got the 22 way front seats), smooth power from the turbo 6, and overall features and functionality. The dealer even picks up and delivers the car for maintenance and leaves us a loaner, all included in the price. Lots of little things add to the experience like the best Bluetooth phone I’ve ever heard. The other party has no idea I’m calling through the car even at highway speeds. After almost a year and 25k miles there has been zero issues. We put on a lot miles and expect to get many years of worry free driving. If I want to be nit picky the mpg has averaged just 21, but the vehicle runs on regular and is AWD.

At 53000 miles still running great with no issues. I had to put new tires on it (went with the factory Hankooks due to quietness and overall performance) and air filter. Otherwise the car needed only synthetic oil changes every 9k miles. Opted out of extended warranty due to no issues. I still have 70k warranty on the power train. Still love the car and glad I got all the extras. They really haven’t added anything to the new cars.
"
lincoln,mkx,2017,VikesFan, 07/30/2018,6 months into my lease,4,"I leased a 2017 MKX Reserve with the 2.7 turbo (Edmunds, fix the auto category to include this) about 6 months ago, have 11K miles on it.  This car is a fantastic driver, especially in sport mode...it is very quick and agile.   In comfort setting, it is great on the road as well.   I upgraded to the better seats with cool air venting and the massages.   The massage feature are more like a parlor trick to amuse your friends, but for me not used often.   Still cool though.   Best things about the car:  quiet, great handling, audio/radio, connectivity with apple phone, seats are very comfortable, head lights are great, automatic wipers, heated steering wheel (in MN this is a very appreciated), panoramic sunroof, and being able to start it with my phone from anywhere (when I land at the airport, can start up to have it heated before I get to my car).  Also, it is a very beautiful design.....I think better looking that the Audi Q5 and Merc GLC (which were the ones I considered along with the MKX).   What I would change/shortcomings:   I have rattles in the dash that I need to get fixed, the transmission in normal mode is a little hinky on downshifts, the radio takes a few seconds to dial in the stations when you change them, and the gas mileage is lower than hoped for (I usually get between 22 and 24 depending on the how much highway.)   Would I lease again... I will definitely consider it, as it really has been a great vehicle so far.   The new Nautilus has an upgraded grill and I have a better 8 or 9 speed transmission.
"
lincoln,mkx,2017,Jerry Zee, 08/07/2017,Annoying,4,"Great car. Called a SUV but it really is not. The 2015 was taller and more like a true SUV. The 2017 is lower and slightly wider. We opted for the 2.7L turbocharged model. The turbocharger is loud on acceleration and very annoying. Dealer said all is well and nothing wrong. Took an identical car for a test drive and its turbo also was very loud on acceleration. Test drove several other Ford vehicles that  were turbocharged and could not hear any noise upon acceleration. Apparently this problem is unique to 2017 Lincoln MKX with the 2.7L that is turbocharged. This problem is not recognized by Lincoln so my advice is to refrain from purchasing this model until the problem is resolved.
"
lincoln,mkx,2017,Allison, 12/02/2017,Driver's seat is the worst,1,"The 2017 MKX looks great and has more technology features than you can imagine. The only problem is that the seats are made of poor quality materials and are not comfortable. Headrests on front seats tilt too far forward, causing neck pain. Seat cushions do not have enough support and they are very narrow (flat part is only 11 inches wide!) and bolsters on side make sitting surface more like a U shape than a normal seat. Back of seat is too bucket-like so I end up sinking into bottom and back of seat. Even went back to dealer for assistance with adjustments but no luck. Second row seats are flatter but still not comfortable. I am a 5'7"" female and slim. MKX is now parked  in garage because I get neck and back pain when I drive it. I am driving my son's 2003 Highlander instead. I would not recommend the MKX.

lincoln,mkx,2017,MONROE GLASER, 08/20/2018,"LINCOLN is going back in time - REMEMBER the 70""s",1,"Lincoln dealers are independent - see if you can find any tele or address beyond - Lincoln Conceirge, you cant. If Lincoln Concerige tells you to to ""go jump in the lake"", what do you do????? You have already had it with the little boys and girlie's at the dealer or you would not be at this point. Lincoln refuses to help. Another dealer down the road told me ""you did not buy the car here, so we WILL NOT help you"". The car was fine - nothing worked / NOTHING. No help from salesman or shop except lies. Seven months later everything is fine. No super-duper mechanic, no fancy equipment or tools - - - -""OH, Mr Glaser we forgot to prep the car before it was delivered to you"". REALLY, 7 months to find this out? I wonder what would have happened if I  would have a serious problem - like a flat tire I have purchased 17 new cars in my life so far, and yes, Mr Lincoln, I an going to join your group to go back to the 70""s. I have been told by all of the foreign dealers that purchasing a $55,000.00 car from them I will not receive ""JUNK"". But please - let us remember one important item here. With the technology and advanced quality  systems and standards auto's leaving the assembly line are near PERFECT. So if your car is not perfect on receipt you bought it from a ""JUNK DEALER"" and there are plenty of them, especially at Lincoln. When a customer gets in bed with the owner and the two of them go after another customer (ME) you are dead. Hower with the excellence of the entire dealership in these actions, they must do it a lot?? Approved by lincoln? Yes, too many sales, must sort some out - it's working.

lincoln,mkx,2017,Alan, 08/03/2020,Great midsize SUV,5,"One must-have feature is the air conditioned seats, and it's only available on Reserve and Black Label trim levels.  We love the cappuccino interior, which provides a sharp contrast with the black plastic trim - most have black interiors which lacks that contrast.  The 3.7 is a powerful and responsive engine, smooth and quiet in normal driving but sounds great when accelerating hard.  Some people dislike the transmission shifter on the dash rather than the center console, but my wife is a coffee drinker and frequently spills on the console, and that was the primary reason we opted for the MKX rather than the Ford version of this SUV, the Edge Sport.  Relocating the shifter also opens up an additional storage cubby in the console, which includes a handy easy to see USB port that's in front of you rather than back by your elbow.  One other advantage of the MKX is the nose slopes down while the Edge is more squared off - so you can see the road in front of you a lot closer in the MKX.  Finally the basic Lincoln warranty is 4 yrs/50k instead of 3 yrs/36k.

lincoln,mkx,2017,Pat, 09/03/2020,2017 MKX Reserve,5,"I just purchased a 2017 model lease back with only 13k miles. I loved my mkz and wanted to move up to a suv. I’ve only had the mkx for one week but so far I love it. The 3.7L is very smooth and plenty fast. I’ve always loved the styling of the mkx and actually prefer the front grille look over the new nautilus. The mileage appears to be spot on to what the sticker claimed. I’m so happy with the purchase and hope that I won’t have any quality issues. I never had any with my Mkz, so I’m hoping to have another positive experience. I’d highly recommend this vehicle. It’s much nicer than the edge in my opinion and if you can pick up a low mileage used one they aren’t much more expensive. 
"
lincoln,mkx,2018,Chris A, 04/19/2018,Love this vehicle,5,"Overall, I'm 6 months in and love this vehicle!  The quietness of the interior, performance, people/cargo hauling capability, park-ability, fuel economy (24 hwy), and beautiful lines are all a treat.  I'm biased maybe, but I really like how this vehicle looks.  The lines are simple, unique, elegant.  That and the size is just perfect, being easy to park, yet taking 4 people in roomy luxury pretty much anywhere.  On top of that, the base model has all the creature comforts I want and a few more.  With bluetooth connectivity that is pretty seamless (phone, Pandora, google-maps), nice leather heated seats, remote start, and comfortable roomy rear seats.  Flip the button and the rear seats go down and you have a great cargo cavern to load up with whatever.  From a winter/capability standpoint, the AWD system seems to just always get traction...where my prior RWD 4x4 would fishtail or delay pulling out of the subdivision the torque and engine weight up front w/ an assist from the back wheels seems much more stable/capable for 99% of my needs.  That, and it's really hard to get stuck (especially if you shut off traction control, which was not obvious at first) when you need engine rev's to get out.  I've also towed a good size trailer with it and it was rock solid. All in all, a very nice package with many creature comforts at a high value.
"
lincoln,mkx,2018,Mike, 09/30/2018,A very smooth SUV,5,"My MKX is a top of the line Black Label model with the 2.7 turbo charge engine with 21 inch wheels.  I like to drive it in Sport Mode as opposed to Comfort or Normal.  The ride is top notch and the 2.7 turbo engine has peppy and smooth pick up.  All  the pick up you will ever need or want.  The Black Label interior is luxury, the 22 way seats with massage are wonderful.  The Push Button gear shift (which unclutters the central console) takes only about a week for you to stop  glancing down and place your hand on the console to search for the non existent gear shift.   Instead you look ahead and push a button with eyes toward the front of the car.  Now the center console is for large central storage compartments and 2 open storage areas in front of the dual cup holders.  The Black Label leather interior is top of the line. I have the thoroughbred theme which is black and tan with maple wood paneling.  The safety technology on this model includes all the recently available features from 360 degree camera, BLIS, Adaptive Speed Control, Lane Assist and forward collision.  Combined with SYNC 3 (which is a major improvement over previous systems) Navigation, voice command, apple play, USB ports and modem, you have a truly luxury well equipped SUV that rivals and often surpasses those   offered by other manufactures.
"
lincoln,mkx,2018,Alex, 05/02/2019,The best luxury SUV for the money,5,"2.7 twin turbo engine is great, excellent fuel economy for this super powerful engine. Interior is beautiful and extremely comfortable (love massaging front seats) and all options are very helpful and easy to use, etc. Look at some previous bad reviews written by strange people (which replacing steering pump, since 2016 steering has electric assist and pump not exist) and Lincoln dealerships rated at the top of the list for customer satisfaction and service in the country. Now I have 23000 miles and enjoyed every minute of driving. 360 degree cameras, cross traffic warning, line control, adaptive cruise control, huge variety of vehicle and driver assist information, etc. are awesome. Couple of things bowsers me, as an example: seat memory always come back to primary setting and I have to resume my setting every time I am getting in the car (primary setting definitely belongs to my wife) and foot operation of rear hatch can't be disable and couple of times I bump my head as hatch started to close unexpectedly (probably due to movement of my foot under bumper), but it isn't important and can be managed, otherwise this is probably best car I ever had to drive and as test engineer I droved practically almost every car in the world. One more warning: HANKOOK tires are garbage had to replace them at 20000 miles and Hankook doesn't provide any warranty after one year of usage, so replace them as soon as possible or don't buy vehicle with Hankook tires in the first place not to get in trouble on the road. 35K miles now, enjoying every minute in the car, have no complains, nothing wrong with the car, just changing oil and go again. Couple recalls, but probably not affected my car as I don't have letter to go to dealer and perform update.

lincoln,mkx,2018,ANGRY MKX OWNER, 07/12/2019,UNRELIABLE & UNRESOLVED NAV SYSTEM,4,"Update 1/15/2020.  The car is great but nothing has been resolved regarding the Navigation system. 

I purchased a new MKX December of 2018. THE NAVIGATION SOFTWARE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE SOME CITIES, STREETS OR BUSINESSES!! I've taken the car to 3 Dealerships to resolve this problem without any success. 
For example: 1) It won't delete waypoints. 2) It identified a Costco 87 miles away but not the 2 within a 10-mile radius. 3) I entered the address for Home Depot, it delivered me to Kohl’s Department store and said, ""You have arrived at Home Depot""!?!?! 4) The street sign is different than stated on the Nav system.  5) It states you have arrived at your destination when you're half a mile away and the system terminates OR you're in front of the destination and it states you are 400 ft. from the destination.  6) It tells you to turn onto nonexistent streets or to make a left turn straight into A LAKE!! UGH!! 7) Instead of making a U-turn it takes you a 1/2 mile down the road and make 3 left turns.  8) Voice recognition is haphazard. Several times I requested an address within the state, and it selected a state hundreds of miles away. 9) It ignores settings and takes you thru residential areas and back roads instead of highways.  
The current dealership had my car for 4 days.  I was given the same model as a loaner and it had identical Navigation problems!! It’s not just my car with the problem! 
Now I've been told it may take months for the Software Engineers to solve the problem or before another update comes out. I travel extensively and a RELIABLE Navigation system is an absolute necessity!! You would think that on a $56,000 car you would not encounter such problems or such a lackadaisical attitude from the Lincoln Customer Service Department for resolution!!

lincoln,mkx,2018,sherry, 06/05/2020,AWFUL,1,"purchased the MKX select &  have had this vehicle  for a year and a half. The suv had  under 5,000 miles on it when we purchased it. A week or 2 after we bought it, we were driving  & I felt the car jerk while driving & the oil light came on. (this was the only time the oil light came on, now it just breaks down with no warning) We pulled over & checked the oil- it was extremely  low- hardly any in it. We took it back to the dealer & they did an oil change. Same thing happened  a few months later. We have been in & out of the shop non stop with the same issue. It keeps eating  up oil, but there is no obvious  oil leak. The oil light doesn't  even come on, or give us a warning- it just breaks down. We have been in & out of shops since we bought the piece of junk.  They couldn't  figure out the issue, so the shop was told to rebuild  only the top part of the engine. Lincoln said that other cars that are our make/model have had the same issue, so they were rebuilding just the top part because they didn't  know what else to do & that is what they were doing in these cases. So , I got my car back a few months (they had it in their shop for over a month) ago & had it back for maybe 2 months & BAM, I get in my car to leave someone's house & it wouldn't  start...  so I was stranded AGAIN. I had to tow the car to my house... again. We took it back to the shop & they said they didn't  know what to do with it since we had had it in there so many times. We even took it back every few hundred miles for the oild consumption  test, so we were in & out of shops A LOT. Now we were told by the corporate office to take it to a different  lincoln  dealer out of our town to see if they can figure it out. I just had a baby so now we have to have our family come watch him & drive an hour away to take it to other dealer. We have to start all over & we're told we need to drive up there every 500 miles.  I have been dealing with the corporate  office & they are rude & useless. I asked to speak to someone  above the lady I'm  dealing  with & she said there is no one else above her. Our warranty  is about to run out & when I asked if they would at least extend the warranty, I was told they can't  do that. This has been the most stressful  situation  I have ever had with a car. I will NEVER, NEVER buy a Lincoln  again. We are stuck in a super high car payment  with no help. I really wish I could get the CEOs contact info, or someone  higher up. This is not right at all. Would give ZERO stars

lincoln,mkx,2018,David Nudell, 01/17/2019,Screwed in Oklahoma,1,"Be advised that Lincoln must be going out of business. They are not making new parts for their new autos. My new 2018 MKX right front headlight was damaged on October 26, 2018 and Lincoln could not get me a new headlight until January 11th, 2019. No headlights (that worked) were available in the United States. I am paying $752 a month on my lease and can't get my car out of the shop because there are no headlights to replace the damaged one. To make it worse, I paid for a Black Label service and it really sucked. In January, my ""SPECIAL ADVOCATE"" was offering me 4 days of lease compensation for my long wait. Well Mel, can take his offer and place it where the Sun doesn't shine. I got a new advocate and she got a headlight on the way and was at least going to compensate me for most of my down time. I haven't seen a penny yet but I have faith in her. I needed another new vehicle and bought a $95,000 dollar Cadillac ESV. I was ready to buy a Lincoln until this mess. Mel, you just cost Lincoln a sale and probably any future sales from me or any of the 1000 people I work with. I had a similar problem with a new Chevrolet in 2014 and after 1 month, they offered to give me my money back or in 3 days they would have the car fixed and give me a credit of $1000.00 to use in their parts department. They offered this to me, I didn't even have to ask. I took the $1000 deal and bought 6 new jackets. I love the car and have had no problems since then. We now have a new headlight and estimate that I will get my new MKX Black Label ready to drive on Monday January 21, 2019 almost 3 months being broke down. Am I eligible for the Oklahoma Lemmon Law?

lincoln,mkz-hybrid,2011,HybridZ, 11/14/2010,Young Lincoln owner LOVING the MKZ,5,"I had a Lexus LS430 and a VW Jetta TDI and I decided to have the best of both worlds by combining luxury and efficiency.  The MKZ Hybrid was what I kept coming back to, but I was not too keen on the ""senior"" stigma with Lincolns.  I bit the bullet in 9/10 and ordered an MKZ Hybrid in Bordeaux Reserve with the Cashmere Executive Package and Ultimate Package.  I LOVE this car and have no regrets.  Lincoln may not command the snob appeal of other brands, but I am satisfied to be one of the first owners of a Lincoln Hybrid.  As a pioneer (younger Lincoln owner) I hope to be a part of Lincoln's renaissance.  This car is great on many levels and the Lincoln Touch/Sync is amazing."
lincoln,mkz-hybrid,2011,robvee, 03/12/2011,2011 MKZ 2100 miles on it now,4,"I purchased mine about 3 weeks ago.
I purchased it under the X-Plan.
In addition, the dealer was able to find other incentives.
MSPR was at 42K, I got mine for 34K.
Very nicely equipped.
I'm 6' and have plenty of legroom and with the adjustable seats, headroom is not an issue.
I drive about 70% highway and 30% city.
Am currently averaging 41.4 mpg on this tank.
Have not gotten anything under 40 mpg.
The car is very eye appealing and for that price, why get the sister car Ford Fusion?
Even still, you can get one w/out the nav package for 34K.
If you ask me 6K for the luxurious amenities is a no brainer.
Great car, very satisfied with my purchase.
Highly recommend."
lincoln,mkz-hybrid,2011,Shell, 11/20/2010,Just love my new MKZ Hybrid,5,"Been driving it for two weeks now and just totally love it.  Average of 37.4 MPG for driving both highway and city.  The legrooms for both front and rear are bigger than my previous Jaguar S Type sedan.  Only cons will be the trunk.  Since that's where the battery is stored, you actually lose some storage space there.  But overall, it's a very nice car to drive."
lincoln,mkz-hybrid,2011,rubesemi, 12/30/2010,"Happy MKZ Owner (3 weeks w/ 1,400 miles)",4,"I turned in a 2008 CTS-4 w/ the 'hotter' engine, and enjoy the MKZ more so, albeit for different reasons.
The vehicle is solidly built, w/ no glitches.
The THX sound system is the equal to the CTS Bose, and the Bluetooth phone quality is outstanding.
The Nav is also very nicely done.

It is a very quiet ride, not too soft with reasonably good handling; I find it to be very responsive and stable in almost all conditions.
I replaced the stock tires with Blizzak WS70's for MI winter driving, and the improved traction over the 'low rolling friction' stock tires is noticable and welcomed.

I managed 43.0 mpg in to work this am; 31.5 highway trip @ 75 mph w/ winter tires."
lincoln,mkz-hybrid,2011,Dave Fleck, 02/09/2017,I love this car!,5,"This has been a great car! Great ride, quiet, good acceleration. Very reliable. I got it at a good price as a Lincoln certified used car with 17,000 miles. Drove it a lot for for the first 2 years. Certified used is the way to go ... saved money and 100,000 miles warranty. Only two issues ... I had to replace the chrome platted wheels as they shiny chrome plate peeled off the wheel when you brush up along a curb. Also, although the SYNC Bluetooth connection works well I find it's hard to set up and get to know.
"
lincoln,navigator-l,2007,jr17, 03/26/2012,"Outdated, needs upgrades",2,"I bought the Nav thinking I would come to love it, but it never happened. The rear end, tail lights, looks really outdated. Make the taillights more stylish and make the rear window smaller. That giant window in back is getting old and boring. Add a back up cam, and make this more aerodynamic. I like Ford, and it drives nice, but the motor like the chassis is outdated. 300 hp for a vehicle this big? Come on, this think should have 350 hp with 15-17 mpg. If you can't get this., fire your engineers and hire someone else.. No more Ford for me."
lincoln,navigator-l,2007,Mohamad, 03/31/2009,Best SUV Yet,5,"I bought this car a couple of months ago after recently selling my 2003 Navigator because we thought we needed a more room because we are family of 7 and we always said we would get a bigger car. We tried the Escallade ESV and the GMC Yukon EL but when it came to it, the Navigator was best. I have 2 teenage kids who are really tall and love the room only in the Navigator because of our last one. This car is really good for travel. My family and I went on a 14 hour trip to Tennesse from Tampa and we went none stop with all 7 of us and also we took my nephew and all of our stuff that hit to the roof in the truck. It drove nice and smooth and it was even raining and I put alot of weight. Perfect!"

lincoln,navigator-l,2007,1happyperson, 03/01/2007,Way to go ford,5,"I've owned a 2004 navigator and this one blows the old one out the water. It has a ton of power and it never skips a beat, the 6 speed transmission shift with out any noise inside the cabin. Passing car will never be a problem with this car. The gas mileage is better than what you would think at 13 mpg. The exterior has a bold face that can't be beat, it looks more like a 100k car than a 60k car. From what I can see now the build quality is the best around, the cabin is so quite that you can here a pin drop. There is almost no outside noise even at speeds of 80 mph.The car feels safe and stable. The car fills so comfortable that it feels like your sitting on your living room chair. Go get it"
lincoln,navigator-l,2007,familyman, 03/13/2007,Missing a few items,4,"Very smooth, quiet ride.  We have four teenagers, all tall, and the leg room in the second and especially the third row can't be beat.  Looked at the Escalade ESV, Mercedes Benz GL 450 and the QX 56.  Decided on the Navigator L because of price, the roomy interior and the power fold third row. I only have had it about a month, but so far I like it. My previous SUV was a 2002 GMC Denali. Definitely an upgrade on interior space, although the Denali was not as firm to drive. I do believe that Lincoln left off a few items that should have been included on their ""premier SUV"". No bluetooth, backup camera, heated second row seats, mute button on steering wheel or even daytime running lights. "
lincoln,navigator-l,2007,ggzobz, 05/31/2007,Great New SUV!,4,"Missing are staple features in luxury cars. As stated, Bluetooth, backup camera specifically. Sirius radio is awesome! Love the seats and colors.  Rear DVD is flawless and the Navi interface, rear controls and stereo controls are very easy to use, even without the 45 minute walk around from the salesman (I have no patience for such things and prefer to learn them myself).  Finally, Bravo on the A/C seats (missing on the 2007 Yukon XL Denali, my ranch vehicle, but it has back up cam.)"
lincoln,navigator-l,2007,dtipainter, 11/08/2007,My 07 Navigator L experience,3,"After looking at several SUV's, we decided to try a Navigator L.  We were impressed with the styling, comfort, and size of the vehicle.  The heated and cooled seats were a nice idea.  Too bad the seat's cooling function isn't sized properly to cool on hot days. Roughly 5 months into the ownership, we are quite disappointed in the car."

This black beauty has top quality, awesome appearance, excellent fit and finish, total comfort and ease of operation and handles and rides great so far. My fuel use experience is 18 city/22 highway. I use the Navigator L for daily commuting and hauling/carrying cargo.  Even family and friends love the best in class 3rd row seating comfort and the quietness while driving is unrivaled.  Cadillac, Infiniti, Mercedes and Acura Luxury SUVs come nowhere near the Navigator L in any comparable areas.  I am very pleased with this vehicle and highly recommend it!     "

It is great for taking the kids to school and going to work in. This SUV is my 5th car in 10 years and I think that I am going to keep this car for a long time."
lincoln,navigator-l,2009,Allan, 05/31/2009,best yet = love it,5,"This is my fourth navigator and first ""L"". It is by far the best yet. I absolutely love this vehicle.  The Navigation is so consumer friendly.  My wife has a BMW 750 which pales in comparison.  I drove a Cadillac Escalade as a rental for five days recently and did not like it at all. The sync system has features not to be believed. Lincoln you really did it right this time!"
lincoln,navigator-l,2009,Sondra Braun, 02/02/2017,Great until Now,3,"There appears to be a problem on these cars with the braking system. I bought it new in 2008 and do not use it exclusively as we have other vehicles. So the mileage is very low, 31.600  Suddenly last year brakes were very loose feeling and I had to go almost to floor to stop.....It was scary, I took it to 2 dealers, and another private mechanic.  No one could find anything wrong although they both changed the master cylinder. the work was costly. They agreed with me that there was something not right. 
 I got almost no support from Lincoln customer service rep.  She did give me an x pin number which is a discount from Lincoln Dealers but is at their own discretion as to how much.   We like the Navigator ride but do not trust the brakes,  so are currently looking to buy another Navigator  -- keeping our fingers crossed!!

lincoln,town-car,2000,raven35, 04/04/2012,My Dream Car,4,"This is my first Town Car and believe me, it wont be the last. I wish I had driven one sooner. It rides like you are driving on clouds. It acts as if bumps and pot holes were not even on the road. The interior is all leather and the seats are very comfortable. There is a large amount of cabin space and I was surprised at the leg room in the rear passenger compartment. I am 6'3"" and have plenty of leg room in the back. The V8 engine is very strong with a lot of torque. This car gets moving in a hurry. I am also surprised at how quite the ride it. At 65 mph, there is very little road or wind noise. "
lincoln,town-car,2000,Mike E., 10/10/2015,Hidden Gem,5,"Here in the Pacific Northwest people pay a premium price for worn iut Subarus and trucks. This 2000 Lincoln Town Car with 79,000 miles on it set me back $4,000. A Subaru Outback with 160,000 miles will cost you $5,500. I'm a 40 year old guy and people might say that I bought a grandpa car. Well maybe so, but it's by far the best car that I have owned. It is fast, quiet, has a great sound system, the comfort level is almost extreme. Make sure you don't fall asleep when driving the Town Car. If you can find one of these gems and don't mind the snide comments buy one. Ford nailed it with this car and because there is no nitche market for these (not many people looking to buy used Lincolns) the prices, at least in Washington state, are great.

Just came back from 2500 mile trip, 80 mph and 25 mpg, sailed along like it always does.  Snobs can drive other things, this is the best for a car load of toys and presents and smart driving.  I don't care what the others think, they're wrong. This is a tough, solid car.  Had one before totaled, t-boned by squad car, and i didn't even get a scratch.  Want to live and live good?

lincoln,town-car,2000,lvmylincoln, 09/29/2013,Consumers have lost a great luxury vehicle,4,"I have read Edmunds review of the Lincold Towncar and in my opinion, it was written by someone who is only into sports vehicles and small vehicles. I have owned Lincoln Towncars since 1980, in fact, my wife and I both drive Towncars and both have loved the Towncar since our first, which was a 1980 Mark.
These vehicles have always gotten better gas mileage that the standard Ford, Chevrolet or Chrysler product.
They have cost us less to operate and repair than any vehicle we owned prior to the Lincoln.
They have gone through several major style changes since 1980 and are still the most luxurious ride.
This includes all the foreign & domestics."

(MUST turn OFF air bag switch in trunk before jacking it up!). converted it to a standard coil spring setup for approx 1/2 the price. couple sets of brakes and tires and thats about it in nearly 10 yrs.

The only major problem I had was a blown out spark plug at 210,000 miles,which was probably my fault because I did not torgue it. Was able to find a used engine for about the same price has a new head. The car could use more power. However for traveling you can't beat it. Repair cost have been a lot less than for Cadillac owners I've known. You can't beat the ride comfort. Will buy another one next time. "

This car has plenty of leg room not only for the front sead riders, but more then enough room for the back seat riders as well.  My parents have cadillacs.

passenger leg room is cramped.  As a 
matter of fact, my long legged friends 
all prefer sitting in the back seat 
because their knees are in their faces 
in the front seat!

Overall though, this has been an 
incredibly reliable car - never needed 
anything but oil changes since I bought 
it 3 years ago.  It rides beautifully.  
It is easy to get in and out.  The

I have owned it for 11/3 years and I am approaching 423K. It still has the original engine and transmission. at 412k I had to replace the a/c compressor. Other than regular maintenance that's it. The key is to do the regular maintenance and these cars will last a log long time. Unlike the Cadillac's whose Northstar engines have valve cover issues and the transmission usually fails at about 150k
lincoln,town-car,2001,D. S, 08/30/2016,2001 Lincoln Town Car Cartier is one of the best!,5,"They FLOAT over the road surface... not as floaty as the 90's Tow Cars, but yes, they still float. With air ride bumps are not even a consideration. Personally I don't want a sports car feel that corners like its on a rail. I like that floaty-boaty feel! When your spending big money for  luxury car.. that's exactly what you want it to feel like, period! The engine is as storing is the day I bought it.. and the appearance is just as good. Every vehicle acts differently depending on who the owner/driver is, and mine has been somewhat pampered. With just over 191 THOUSAND ""and not stopping anytime soon"", its my daily driver. 117,000 miles out of the factory brakes before needing a change. Just bought the 3rd battery, and went the first 10 years without spending a cent. Finally at 150,000 miles the air ride shocks started to weaken, so I had them changed for another set. NO! I did not resort to coil & springs! No even an option. Other than that, I have adored this car since the day it was built. Only a very few complaints.. and not the car itself, but the design. Who's bright idea was it to make the headlights detachable (for bulb changing purposes I guess) lock in place with 3  tin clips? When hitting a hard bump, they wobble. And its noticeable to me and drivers in front of me. Secondly, the easy in/exit moving seat stopped working early on. Dealer said he's surprised I got that far. He told me.. don't last, never did, hasn't seen one work right since day one. I would have had it fixed, but it required full seat replacement.. and cost huge money. Thankfully it stopped in the exact position I use and like. Other than that, I am shooting for 250, thousand. These Town Cars last forever. Gas mileage is good. Rated at 17&25. 6 disc CD changer in the trunk. HUGE trunk. And eve  after 15 years, its still unmistakably Lincoln. People ask.. when are you going to buy a new car. Answer: when they bring Town Car back! I'd rather drive a 15 year old Lincoln, htan something lesser that's brand new.

On a trip to Rome, Ga from Chambersburg, PA, (all interstate and driving 60 MPH) we averaged 32 MPG.  Several years ago while driving in the flatland of North Dakota we averaged nearly 34 MPG for several hundred miles and driving at 60 MPG and on cruise control.  People assume that because it is a big car that it is a gas guzzler.  Nothing could be further from the truth."

Went to Missouri from Wisc. crusing mostly 85/90 and got 28 mpg.  This car loves to go. At 70 ours kicks in again for passing. Have only had regular service done, runs great.  Need a CD player.  Has great speaker sound. Cup holders in the way of heat/ac controls. Even though car is so smooth a cup could sit on the armrest. Have had car in major snowstorms & handles well. Our 16 yr. old learned in this car.  Back seat leg room is for anyone & I prefer the back seat for the comfort. Side windows are bellowed out, great for sky viewing for kids at night."

more than adequate.  The service is 
free during the entire time of you

   Tis an awesome vehicle and just when 
you think you have found a flaw, you 
get a solid 20 mpg in the city.  The

25mpg if you 'keep you foot out of it'"

We added a six pack CD changer.  My wife and I dont have to scream to hear each other (as we did in our Club Wagon)and since we are both lifetime WW members, we could sit four of us abreast in the frontbut choose not.  We ensured a safe purchase by using CarFax to research the vehicle history.  This car just makes traveling a real pleasurethe only thing missing is aroma therapy candles (on second thought, leave them out).  We are experiencing 18.8 mpg city and 24-25 mpg highway.

We feel a lux. car like the Lincoln should have a softer leather. Ours has very hard leather which makes it somewhat uncomfortable on trips, slippery, stiff, etc.. My biggest objection with the car is the mushy ride and the way the car floats on corners. I had a Thunderbird before with 258K miles and I loved the handling package, made you feel like you had control of the car, not vice versa. I have a pickup that I drive 35000 mile a year and I feel safer with the handling than the Lincoln. Also had a bunch of intermittent electrical issues. But, still love the car."

Fuel economy is generally about 17 in the city, but 25 on the highway. I have seen it go as high as 27 at a steady 60 MPH. One of the safest cars on the road, because these cars are tanks. The car drives like a car from the 1960s, and has a robust, quality feel that is lacking from American cars today. Reliability is stellar, only replaced ball joints at 121K and done regular oil changes and tire replacements. They truly don't make them like this anymore!

Of course the Lexus is a wonderful car, it's $30,000 more! It better be. The town car is wonderful for the money. The quality is more than adequate, nothing compares in the way of interior room and comfort. And no, it's not a rocket off the line, but it's not supposed to be. Quite honestly, I don't believe the suspension could handle it, but then again, you wouldn't have the ride. You want handling, buy a corvette, stupid."

At the time, I needed a car that would accommodate my multiple spine and hips issues. After 20 test drives of other cars, I was totally sold on this one. Controls are easy to use, starts right off in Minnesota sub-zero temps, and extremely durable. It's built like a tank in every way. Easy access for regular service, and fantastic MPG. After driving Cadillacs for most of my life, they don't come close to this Pearl Blue Lincoln. It has every option that was available for the 2002 models. If you want big performance and power, look for something else. These aren't made for that. Still, at 178,000 miles, I can hit the gas and still squawk the tires. Passing on the freeway is quite easy for the 4.6 liter. Like anything, you take care of it and it will take care of you. This beautiful machine will last another 100,000+ miles easily.

lincoln,town-car,2002,Dick Johnson, 06/07/2019,Lincoln Town Car = A Great American Icon,5,"First-of-all, we love the Lincoln Town Cars (1998 - 2011).     I think Lincoln would have not lost sales, and not decided to quit making the Town Cars, if Town Cars would have:  1) offered an All-Wheel-Drive option like all other luxury car manufacturers offer;                                                       2) offered ""cooled seats"", ""back-up camera"", ""lane guidance""; ""rear cross-traffic warning"", and more, as options like others do;                                                                                                                                           3) remove the unnecessary tachometer in the precious space of the instrument cluster because it's not a high performance car;               
4) update the lacking electronic technology to attract younger buyers;                                                                                                            
5) replace the trouble-some Headlight Control Module (headlight switch) (a problem with the sister car Mercury Grand Marquis');   
6) improve the quality of the steering pump, and all the front-end parts.                                                                                                
GOOD POINTS: We love the HUGE trunk space, the quiet and smooth luxury ride, the handsome style, the cars handling, the cars safety ratings, the cars resale value, the cars comfortable interior space for 6-adult-passengers, that the car was made in America, and the envy of other non-Town Car automobile owners.

Very satisfied -but wish they would upgrade gas tank to 20 gallons and improve gas tank safety for rear impact, although it is pretty reasonable now. Great seat warmer, or as I refer to it prostate warmer. Paint did tend to scratch easily on the plastic parts -perhaps some insufficiently durable water based paint used on those parts??

lincoln,town-car,2002,FSC, 07/08/2009,Modern Classic.,4,"I'll start off by saying I titled my review ""modern classic"" because that's basically what this car is. A modern spin off of big 1950's full sized cruiser sedans. The bench seat, column shifter, V8, rear wheel drive, body on frame construction, and shear size make it feel like a more refined classic cruiser. This is something I really like about the car. This isn't a car for people who want a Mercedes or BMW, this is a car for people who want a true laid back cruiser. However, if I were to do it again I would have gotten a top end Crown Vic or Marquis as the mechanicals and interior are %99 the Town Car as the town car for less money. "

Other than that, just regular maintenance. It has been quite reliable and gets reasonable gas mileage for such a large car. On state highways going 65, I get 27 mpg.

That fixed it.
I also had trouble with hesitation.
I took it to the local Lincoln dealership and for just under $500, a tune-up and transmission fluid made it drive like a new car.

these Town Cars.  My Town Cars are an 
89, 90, and 94 ALL of them with 
400,000+ miles.  I work in Canada and 
live in FL.  Except for annual and 
regular maintenance...there are no 
problems with the car.  The ride is the 
best out there.  I have driven 
Mercedes, BMW and Lexus.  Those brands 
are nothing compared to a Town Car.  Do 
you know if any import (sedan based) 
that can haul 6 people with full 
luggage in 100 degree weather with the 
AC on high from FL to Canada.  I do it 
4 times a summer."

I love the car very much.  It's the Special Mid-Year model, the ""Limited Edition""in that Silver-Green Fire mist color.  1,000s of compliments on the color!  Car needs 70 horsepower more, otherwise near perfect.  Love the power closing trunk- toy.  Love the moonroof and the in the trunk out of the way CD Changer with the single slot in dash CD.  Sadly, for '05 they dumped that (along with Autolamp system & Rainsense wipers (I mean WHAT are they thinking?  These are standard on a Toyota Avalon & not available on a '05 TC at any price?)

lincoln,town-car,2003,SandyBoy, 05/07/2003,What a Bargin !,4,"I was between the new Infiniti M45 & 
the new mid-year Town Car, the Limited 
Edition Cartier.  The Infiniti had more 
optional toys and what I thought was 
exterior styling more to my taste.  I 
thought the M45 was beautiful from any 
angle.  I drove both.  The T.C. was the 
winner for smoothness and comfort.  The 
M45 was tight inside, especially in the 
rear and legroom in front. Price was 
the clincher!  Both listed just dollars 
apart.  Infiniti dealer would give just 
$1,300 off MSRLP and there was no 
factory rebate.  The TC had $4,000 
rebate & $3,500 off MSRLP & $1,000 
owner loyality bonus, for $8,500 of 
MSRLP.  That closed the deal."

lincoln,town-car,2003,sebago588, 11/23/2012,Homicidal car at best,3,"I purchased this ""Florida driven"" vehicle in April of 2011. It had 70k original miles on it which was one of the selling points. The minute I drove it off the lot, the problems began. Power drivers seat died $360, a/c compressor $500, engine manifold cracked and leaked coolant all over engine damaging spark plugs and cylinders $2000+, bi-polar alarm system $450, engine shuts off randomly when driving but starts back up instantly(??) and this weeks newest problem is an exhaust leak which was estimated to be about $250 at local garage.
Next sedan will most definitely be either a Cadillac Deville or Mercedes S-Class. This Town Car is a death trap on wheels."
lincoln,town-car,2003,rwd, 03/15/2004,Getting better all the time!,4,"Still the best touring sedan on the

17"" wheel, R&P steering, tigher all 
over, 240 hp feels like more because 
of the 280 ft lbs of torque.
Room galore, This car is much better 
than people think,like a FWD...but we 
all know RWD is in!
you can buy these cars brand new
with $10,000 off the sticker at the

and traded my 2000 TC final cost was
$14,000 at 3.8% $413.00/mo for 36

I just took a 17 hour trip from Michigan to North Dakota and was amazingly fresh after being in this smooth rider for so long.  Great car and I got over 25 mpg on the trip."

lincoln,town-car,2003,BrianH, 03/24/2003,2003 plus and minus,4,"Lincoln improved on a lot of little 
things on the 2003's, but the steering 
is a bit of a let down.  The steering 
is more stiff due to the rack and 
pinion steering, plus riding on the 
interstate you feel a lot of wind 
resistance underneeth your feet.  Car 
is more responsive and feels a little 
more sporty.  All of the standard 
quality is still there, but the 
steering and different ride may turn 
off a lot of traditional Town Car 
owners.  I also own an Aviator, no 
complaints at all about that one except 
the gas mileage.  It's awesome!  Town 
Car beats it only on ride comfort, but 
not by much."

Silent interior, has decent power (could use 65 more horsepower.  Flawless execution of assembly & detail. Loads of trunk room, and interior space to spread out. Love the Limited's black grille with chrome surround & HID Fog Lights.  Like the Cassette & C.D. in dash combo with a 6- disc changer in the trunk.  Steering is tight and the handling is worlds better than the pre-1998 Town Cars.  She's a unique light silver-green met with gray/beige interior. Only has 12,000 on her, as from November to April I use a Jeep Cherokee Limited 4X4  (2001)"

lincoln,town-car,2003,Edwin Hite, 05/11/2017,I love Lincoln Town Cars! START MAKING THEM AGAIN,4,"I went to a dealer who charged WAY too much; according to the value assessed on edmunds.com.  My bad; I should have done some homework.  I had an almost identical Lincoln Town Car that had 336,000 miles on it and it was going to cost more than it was worth to fix it so, I went to the dealer and was shocked to see the exact car...different color and THIS one has a sun roof....sitting there like it was waiting for me.  At purchase, it had 92000 miles on it, so; based on my OTHER Town Car; this baby should have plenty of life left in it.  I'm VERY happy with my purchase (except the paying too much part of it) ONLY problem is that the park assist only works when it's raining.  But, that is the ONLY thing that isn't working.
"
lincoln,town-car,2003,Stevce M, 04/04/2018,Get one before they are all gone!,5,"I have long been a fan of the Town Car, it's classic looks, the floating/comfortable ride and long term dependability. That's why taxis and limos use them. I had to replace the fuel pump and the coil packs but at 110K, it was time. This car looks great for a 15year old ride and it has all the space a man and his family can ask for. Power is decent, and not an issue for me. I'll hold on to this car as long as the body holds out.

UPDATE: Well... I have with a heavy heart sold my Town Car. I have a number of cars and some are too similar in what they offered, so I sold the TC and bought a convertible Mustang. The TC is an amazing car. A blend of roominess, smooth, power and classic style. If I had more parking at home, I'd have kept it. Love having all that space and that smooth ride.

lincoln,town-car,2003,Virginia, 10/26/2002,Lincoln's lost their build quality,3,"With 21 years and 400K miles driving 
Lincolns, I loved them and bought the 
'03. More annoying issues with this 
car than I've had in 20 years. 
Vibration at idle is built-in and 
can't be corrected. Compared to older 
Lincolns,the car has poor acceleration 
from low RPMs with poorer gas mileage 
and a smaller gas tank.Contrary to the 
manual-duplicated pages-doesn't have 
DSP.Left out an AM filter so the AM 
reception was a return to the '50s. 
With a fix,dash now rattles. Gas tank 
cover wouldn't open. Lincoln won't 
communicate. Comparing features, 
Lincoln designers have done next to 
nothing in 10 years. I take that back--
they took the quality out."

After having the car for 3 mos. (bought used at 2 yrs.) and 60,000 had to replace the rear axle = $1250.00.  Hub bearings at 65,000 miles = $600.00. Automatic trunk mechanism at 70,000 miles = $400 to repair.  Getting rid of this car....PRICELESS.  The electrical system is failing, all the ""fancy"" gizmos either don't work anymore at all, or work only intermittently, and this is the biggest piece of junk I've ever owned.  Good riddance to the Lincoln Towncar.  Goodbye, Ford, Hello Honda!  At least our other car, a Honda is still going strong at 265,000 miles with very little $$ spent!"

I also use the car for long (100 mi) work trips each week. Yes, style is dated but the car has so many positive features, like good gas mileage for a large car, cavernous trunk, easy to read dash display, automatic climate control, back-up sensor, heated seats, more. Small problems crop up now & then, but I expect that with so many luxury features available. Plus, the car is no spring chicken. Things break."

Around 72K mi developed noise in rear end. I'm now informed that I need a bearing kit for the rear axle. Wearout at less than 75K mi is unsatisfactory. Ford had a recall on ""some"" 2003 TC's, but not mine. Also had to replace brake rotors. They seem to warp easily and require regular turning (maybe it's new metallic type pads).

The huge trunk has an insert to keep loose articles secured below the false floor. This coupled with the limited use spare provides the most usable space in any trunk on the market. The plush leather seats are very comfy & real wood trim is classy. The navigation system is easy to use and very helpful.  The backup assist, makes parking this large car a breeze. I average 24 mpg on regular gas. The brakes have been the only problem area.  In the first 40,000 miles, I replaced all 4 brake pads & rotors.

Now that I've owned it for about 8 months, I can only say that I am extremely pleased with the car. On long trips, there's nothing like cruising down the interstate, feeling like I'm driving my leather couch down the road, only without my big-screen tv in front of me. I've had absolutely no problems with the car. I average 18 mpg around town and a very respectable 25 mpg on the highway. Another big plus with the TC is the safety aspect of having that amount of metal and airbags around you. The car simply looks impressive and is a treat to drive. It may not have stellar performance, but the two ton luxury road yacht makes me happy anyway."
lincoln,town-car,2003,John T., 05/25/2018,Affordable luxury,4,"This car is the last of American big cars.  It's too bad that these aren't made any more as people favor smaller more European style cars.  For the money I paid, this car is quite comfortable.  I do mostly highway driving, and achieve an average of 24 miles per gallon on regular unleaded and during the winter it drops to 22 miles per gallon.  Parts and service are abundantly available since this vehicle was manufactured for so many years with so little changes.  This vehicle brand is still used by limousine and livery services, even though it was discontinued after 2011.  I love this car.

The last one was an S320 diesel which had to go back 13 times to the dealer. This is my 2nd Town Car whilst living in the USA. And it's great, good gas mileage and reasonably reliable. The ""new"" 2003 redesign is a reasonable job. It rides better than an S Class, as quiet too. Not so good at going round corners. I love the 2 speedos for when I go to Toronto - change the digi one to kmh"

lincoln,town-car,2004,Omar, 03/09/2016,Awesome Town Car,5,"Awesome big American V8 sedan. Roomy seats, smooth ride, and nice speakers for a stock car. Average 20 mpg and thats mixed driving in Houston, Tx. Car was bought used so it did had some small scratches, driver seat small tear and some plastics in the interior coming loose. However it did fail once, the IAC valve failed and made my car accelerate on its own and that just 97,000 miles so I think Lincoln should be aware. But easy fixed and running fine again so problem. Despite some minor interior the car is durable on the road. It can handle bumping roads fine, good torque power in uphill and can take on off-road as well. I'm happy with my Lincoln Town Car

Update 3/16/2018

Still have the car, is my daily driver. Last year 2017 I had the intake manifold replace because it was started to leak around the thermostat housing. My car got flooded during Hurricane Harvey however only water got inside the carpet floor. Engine and Transmission got no water thank god! Since than I drove it 6k miles so far and is running fine, just normal maintenance.

Update 9/19/2018
Same runs great. No Issues miles at 130K, smooth ride like it should be. Got it inspection and pass.

I love the ride, plushness and quietness this car have. I also love the beautiful body style. Very Luxurious look. I read other reviews here about road noise and wind noise and I laugh. The only thing wrong with this car is that the IDIOTS at FORD discontinued making it.

It is maroon with a half stone white top. It is one of the best cars I've ever had in the 50+ years Iv'e driven. Quiet, smooth riding and handling. When I pass a slower car even my grandchildren are impressed with the pickup. The stereo is magnificent. I like especially the remote trunk and the easy to adjust clock. I have gotten up to 27 miles to a gallon, normal is 25.4. I've had Packards, Cadillacs, and Chryslers over the years. Nothing comes close to the Lincoln in quality and dependability, and I've had 7.

Last week I purchased a 2004 Towncar Ultimate with 53K miles on it. Whom ever owned it took good care of it as it looks like brand new.  Without question the most comfortable vehicle I have ever ridden in with luxury featurs galore.  I am disappointed to hear that Lincoln is planning to discontinue this model.  That would be a big mistake. I love this car."
lincoln,town-car,2004,Victor L., 10/16/2017,Quiet Waterbed Ride,5,"Mechanically very sound and very dependable. The ride is absolutely smooth and quiet. Acceleration is not very good because the drive train is undersized for the weight and size of the car. The styling is iconic and distinctive; too bad the Towncar is discontinued. This is my third Lincoln and I will probably replace it with the new Lincoln Continental when the 2018 model is available.

More than enough trunk space, gas mileage is OK for a V8, and I must admit that it's the most comfortable car I've ever owned. It's like driving a Lazy Boy recliner.

lincoln,town-car,2004,willie, 04/02/2008,Fantastic Vehicle!,5,"This car is like sitting in your living room. Rides beautiful.

Last years of life should be special for them."
lincoln,town-car,2004,Thomas K, 03/04/2008,2004 Lincoln Town Car,4,"Bought 2004 LTC in 2005. Love this car because: Dimensions are palatial. Ride is unparalleled. Easy to pass slowpokes. Good gas mileage for 4,500 Sedan. Very nice to look at - proud to own. Power everything.  The funny thing about all the editors reviews is that they all say the car basically stinks. But most people who actually buy them love them. I wonder why that is.  I wouldn't drive anything else. By the way the Mercury Grand Marquis is not a poor man's Town Car. The Marquis is a good, solid car, but the Lincoln Town Car easily outclasses the Marquis."

lincoln,town-car,2004,MilesPerHour, 06/13/2019,2004 Lincoln Town Car Ultimate: As rugged as it is,5,"How many domestic luxury sedans can boast reliable 400,000+ mileage capability? How many receive a five out of five star crash rating in every category by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - being the first production passenger sedan in the world to do so? And most important - how many luxury sedans frugally sip regular-grade gasoline making them the unexpected economy car? The 2004 Lincoln Town Car Ultimate is the perfect combination of luxury and logic. Once settled into the leather-clad lounge-type seating, the 'click' of the vault-like door shutting will be the loudest sound one will encounter. Turn the key - the potent 4.6 litre V8 engine whispers its existence. (This is the same mighty V8 engine powering Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors) The silky smooth 4-speed electronic transmission with automatic overdrive imperceptibly engages. Tap the electronically adjustable accelerator pedal and Town Car springs to life effortlessly. No, it will not achieve 0-60 mph in a nanosecond, but then, that's not what this car is intended to do. It's a luxury-laden land yacht despite its sheer size - it handles like a much smaller vehicle. No need to adjust the dual temperature controls, (one set for driver, one set for front seat passenger) once set no further intervention is required,  it maintains the selection automatically. Town Car ""Ultimate"" is equipped as its model name implies...most every amenity is standard - so many in fact, it would be easier to mention what it doesn't have. Even the rear deck lid opens AND closes automatically at the touch of a button on the key fob. I mentioned the unexpected economy car - it goes beyond frugality at the pump. The Lincoln Town Car shares its underpinnings with sisters Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis. Parts are inexpensive and plentiful, you may not need many because these cars are notoriously reliable. Lincoln Town Cars are built on two wheelbases. The ""L"" series are longer versions, many of which are still in service as airport limousines. What impresses me most about my Town Car is the outrageous gas mpg averages. I get 20.5 mpg driving at speeds between 75 and 80 mph. Just for this review...I drove a Town Car with 111,000,164,000, and 200,000 miles comparing their stamina and operating logistics. There's no difference just because of high mileage; however, this is contingent upon the owner's adherence to service/maintenance intervals. Yes, a Lincoln Town Car can easily exceed 400,000 miles if properly maintained. The 2004 Lincoln Town Car Ultimate is classy understated luxury and the perfect marriage of luxury and logic. The 2004 Lincoln Town Car Ultimate is a shinning example of what a luxury car should be...

I would never thought in my wildest dreams, that Lincoln would put out such a disgrace. I am not getting any satisfaction from Ford Motor Co.

very efficient and accurate. The trunk

The 1996 was also an excellent car with a newer design.  My 2004 is now the newest design and is beautiful to look at from the outside.  But, the easy driving/handling of the older models is gone.  This soft floaty ride is the major reason I spend the money on this expensive car - along with long term reliability (all previous cars have been driven 150k+ miles) - but this new model now has the ""Euro-car"" ride which I find rough.  I do not want to ""feel the rode"" as it is put these days.  I want to ""float along."" I will be looking for a cheaper next car - I find nothing in this model worth the $$$."

person and can sit in the back seat

have is regarding the sound system of 
the radio and CD player.  For a car as

The TC delivers because it's just the opposite of my BMW. Relaxed (not lazy) large V8 vs high strung turbo 6. Soft comfy suspension vs stiff ""feel every bump"" coil-overs. Easy to work on, cheap parts vs convoluted (genius though it may be) design with expensive parts. While my 2-door BMW is truly a great sports car, and I love everything about it, sometimes I just want to CHILL OUT while driving. The trunk easily swallows a mini-fridge and more, and RWD is always a win for me. 160K w only minor issues. I love both cars for different reasons"
lincoln,town-car,2005,stgcret, 06/24/2007,My 12th Lincoln,4,"This vehicle is very easy to get in and out of. The Signature Limited is the ticket. I am only missing the moonroof, which I don't really care about anyway.  If you have to be in traffic, you will love the comfort and the dual a/c. I had 2 1997's (last year of old body style) and really had my reservations when the 98's came out, but the 2005 was pretty much redone. I agree that it needs more horsepower, maybe a 5.4 or turbo 4.6 somewhere in the range of 300 HP. The 238 HP is lacking when you got to get around a slower vehicle. The Towncar has always has been a great roadtrip vehicle. It could use less plastic in the interior...and it does use 87 octane gas. "

Great rearbackup warning system, love the 6- pack CD system. Problems: broken gas cap, broken center consule lid, lack of full-size spare (fixed by buying mag wheel with original tire and mounting in trunk!).

I asked the driver what this incredible smooth beautiful car was and he said a Lincoln town car made in 2005. We went shopping for a Town car after selling the Suburban and think it is the best Luxury car I've owned.  I've owned Mercedes, Accura, Sterling, Lexus and this is heads above them all.

We have two Jaguar XJ's, both are fun to drive, but the quietness and comfort don't even come close to our Lincoln. The trunk space is unbelievable too. Last trip we drove the newer Jag.  Thought I'd need a crowbar and a stick of Dynamite to get our luggage out of the trunk. Highway mileage is good (24 MPG) for the size of the car."

lincoln,town-car,2005,Merck, 01/07/2005,New Lincoln Buying Mistake,2,The car is sluggish and transmission hesitates when pushed down to pass or when needed to come up hills.  It does the same when using the Remote Control.  The car seems to be in a wind tunnel after 30 miles per hour.  The hissing sound coming from the driver's side is very annoying and together with the Michelin tires whining noise makes a long drive not too appealing.  As you can see mileage is very low (4200).  I use my wife's 95 Chevrolet Corsica more often than the Lincoln!  Another thing is that the car sways everytime wind hits it on it's side. I'm planning trading this car in for another make.  I'm totally unhappy with my 2004 Lincoln.  Should have leased instead of buying. 
lincoln,town-car,2005,Mark, 06/13/2005,Honest Review,4,"This car is mainly for larger families, although it does have a fair engine; we have to keep in mind it's not a performer like a Cadillac. The ride is smooth, very nice interior, large trunk for your baggage and passengers. BUT here are the problem with Lincoln's; are very delicate. My dad's Town Car had major problem with the power window's, needed new stereo which was like around $1,000 -- leather quality is bad, I mean what kind of leather rips & tears off? When this car starts to give you problems be very well prepared because it will be costly, and dig deep into your pockets. Also the suspension on this car is belive it or not at $600.00. It's a good car, but I would suggest a Cadillac."

The quallity is good but not like a Lexus. The features are okay, the sound system is okay.  I would buy a Lexus instead because this car is not the best luxury sedan, I payed to much.  "

My experience with Lincoln has been dissapointing actually, now I'm not going to say this is a bad car, infact its good - it's just not as luxury refined as a Lexus or Cadillac. Here is the problem with Loncoln's though many people will tell you, whenever a part needs to be replaced it is quite VERY costly to repair.from now on, I won't drive a Lincoln ever, ever again. Another downside of the car it's heavy - real heavy. Gas mileage is not pretty also. With only 18 mpg / and 23 highway driving. If your planning on buying a Luxury sedan, I would suggest to look at the Lexus LS430. Now this is 'the car' to have."

Went to the mall and when I was going to ignite the engine the Key broke making the car unmoveable. Leather seats are cheap, they are now ripped. Now I am not going to say this is a bad car, infact it's good, it's not just not on the same level as Cadillac or Lexus.

He and mom love this car. It is easy to drive and very comfortable. Dad has been impressed with the gas mileage and says that this is the best car he has ever owned. The people at their church think that he must have won the lottery. His last car cost more and was not nearly as plush. It runs very smooth and has plenty of power. I also enjoy driving the car, putting 6000 miles on it on a cross country drive with 4 people and luggage and still got 24 MPG.

On the road, it floats, seats are like my recliner at home, CD player is awesome, the reverse sensors come are a life saver when backing up.

When we owned Cadillacs, we spent most of our time taking them to the dealer for electrical repairs.  Admittedly, Lincoln HQ needs to do something about the service dealers.  In order to get your car in and out, service writers require ""money under the table"" otherwise your car can sit for days or weeks.  It is a corrupt system and demands attention.  "

Fuel economy is decent for a large V-8 at about 23 MPG on the highway.  Riding around town though, this car is big to park and can be hard to maneuver.  Some of the fit and finish coulde be better too, for a car in this price range.  Center caps on the wheels did not hold up at all, and had to be replaced, but that was largely a cosmetic concern.  Chrome molding strips turn brown in the winter, which the dealer tells me is ""normal.""  I don't know about that, but it does wash off."

Wish I had bought this car years ago. The car is great--the problem is that Ford is too stupid to know how to market it."

lincoln,town-car,2005,stgcret, 02/25/2007,Twelve Lincolns and Counting,4,"This is my 12th Lincoln.  I traded a 2005 Signature with 30,000 miles for a 2005 Signature Limited with 5800 miles. What a difference just kicking it up to the next trim level!  More comfort in the seat, heated & memory seats, chrome wheels and the trunk goes all the way up instead of just cracking open in the base Signature and a much quieter ride. Much better stereo. Definitely worth the extra bucks. "

lincoln,town-car,2006,Chris Hawkins, 08/03/2015,Last of the Dinosaurs,5,"Last of the dinosaurs because large RWD, body-on-frame luxury American cars are extinct.   Plus, mine is Black Cherry, which is almost purple.  I had never paid attention to Town Cars before, but when a friend bought a 2001 Cartier in mint condition I looked a lot closer.   I was so pleased with what I discovered that I immediately sought to get one of my own.  After a lot of research I determined that 2006-2007 is the sweet spot for these cars.  Any earlier issues had been resolved since  production began in 1998, and by 2006 they were essentially perfected and had all the upgrades.    I also discovered the Designer Series, which was only made from 2006-2007.  It is the only model in all the years through 2011 that had a unique upgraded interior - more lush than the Signature Limited, Ultimate, or Cartier models.  The shirred leather with contrast piping and adjustable rear headrests stand out.  All but three options were standard on the Designer Series and the car I found has all three:  Moonroof, HID headlights, and Navigation.   It has been such a pleasure to own.  The entire driving experience of the car brings to mind the description Rolls Royce once used for the operation of its cars:  Ball of silk.  All the controls  and its progress down the road have a quality ""ball bearing in oil"" smoothness to them.  The ride is taut, smooth, and tightly controlled and the sound levels are astonishingly low.  Best of all, it feels like a REAL car, not one of these little toy FWD things masquerading as luxury automobiles.   It has the genuine luxury of a level of silence, space and smoothness that has been largely lost in today's downsized cruisers.   Everyone who rides in it is immediately impressed with these qualities.

I also bought the car because I know they are essentially bullet-proof, and easy and inexpensive to repair should something happen.  Even the air springs in the rear suspension (my one concern) are engineered to be swapped out with common hand tolls in less than an hour, and parts for it are cheap and plentiful.   I hope to keep this car for many years  - there is really nothing on the market to replace it with, except another one.  I have had little concern with problems or repairs with the car since I bought it three years ago.  The only significant repair needed was to replace the alternator,

August 2016:  After two years ownership I am happy to report my initial impressions of this car remain intact.  The car continues to be a joy to own and drive.  It has also been 100% reliable, requiring only regularly scheduled maintenance.  I did have an issue with the THX/Navigation radio - more specifically the 6-CD player.  It jammed with a full load of CDs.  I discovered that is a common issue with this radio unit - every one for sale on Ebay has a dead CD player.  However, my radio recently had an ""immaculate repair"".  After several months of a whirring sound for 5 sec. whenever the unit was turned on, it apparently un-jammed itself and the CD player is now operating like new.  (The regular radio and navigation function was never affected by the jammed CD.)  

Also, after two years of hand washing the car, I remain amazed by the impeccable factory paint job.   I have seen brand new Mercedes and Lexuses (Lexi?) with inexcusable orange peel in their paint jobs - this 10 year old Lincoln puts them to shame.  It has a mirror-like paint finish worthy of a high dollar show car.

August 2017:  Not to be boring, but nothing new to report.  The Lincoln Town Car is still performing beautifully and has needed no repairs.  I was driving a Rolls Royce Silver Spur this weekend and a 2006 Bentley Arnage Red Label a few weekends back.  While driving both, I was noting to myself that they are no Town Car as far as smoothness, silence, and silkiness of operation is concerned.   The Lincoln is far more pleasant to drive.

Auguat 2018.
  Still love this car.   A significant repair recently:  replacement  of the intake manifold.  Earlier Ford 4.6 V8's had a plastic intake that was prone to fail,  It was updated with metal water passages around 2003 .  Despite the improved version on my car, it failed at 124K miles.  The part was $180 and I was able to replace it myself.  Good as new again!

August 2019.  The Lincoln still looks and drives like new.  It still surprises when I come back to it after driving other cars for It's smoothness and silence of operation.  No thoughts of replacing it - nothing newer really compares.

February 2020.  Nothing to report - still going strong and dependably.  Still love the car and hope it continues to run forever - which most of them seen to do!

Aug. 2020.  The rear air springs began to leak.  They are beautifully engineered in their simplicity - they basically unhook with a cotter pin and a twist releases the air line fitting.  I did the replacement myself.  I used Arnott springs, $97 each on Amazon. Also, a squeaky radiator fan was replaced as a precaution with summer coming.

lincoln,town-car,2006,0rnery, 08/20/2014,"Rugged, Dependable, Smooth, Quiet...",5,"Why is the panther platform the 1st choice for patrol cars, taxi and livery service?
For the very same reason it's MY 1st choice!
Built like a bull, quiet as a mouse and smooth as a... panther.
I repair my own cars as much as possible, and these cars break down the least of any, and when they do, they're cheap and easy to fix.
Not to mention the inherent safety of a full size, body on frame vehicle.

Just took delivery of a 2006 Designer and it's no different than my previous Town Cars and Grand Marquis' in comfort and roominess.
This platform has been tweaked to perfection as far as drive-ability. 

Update 2019/02/22  The Town Car reviewed above, is a garage queen.  I use it about 500 miles per year.  I still LOVE it.  So much so, I purchased another for a daily driver a couple years ago.  Don't bother with a Grand Marquis, unless your really trying to save a couple bucks.  For about the same price you can get a Town Car that's just as reliable, with more rear legroom.  Both of mine have the sunroof.  I'll never buy another vehicle without.

lincoln,town-car,2006,jessem12801, 11/20/2010,My 06 t/c,4,"I bought a 99 a couple of years ago and didn't like it at all. Not as comfortable as the Lincoln t/c's of the 90's vintage. Then I bought an 05. A little better comfort wise but still worse then the 90's versions. Now I have my 06 sig. Ltd. Comfort is slightly better then the 05 or maybe I'm just used to the seats by now. I like the adjustable pedals and cd changer and the Lincoln town car ride! Nothing else like it. I know the reliability of these cars is second to none since I drove limo's for 20+ years in NYC in these and they never broke! 300,000 miles easy and no issues! I still prefer the old body style though. Just a more elegant looking car all around. Ford has one of the most reliable cars ever"

lincoln,town-car,2006,DR POOL, 10/15/2005,My 2006 designer series town car,4,"I have been driving lincoln since 1972. My 2003 and 2006 are without a doubt the best 2 lincolns i have ever had. I added the navigation system to the 2006 and after figuring out how to use it, i read the book 4 times, it is a miraculous accessory. There is no doubt in my mind that the Lincoln town car is the finest riding automobile in the industry. It performs well, although it needs a 5 speed transmission instead of the 4 speed, but when it shifts into second, it really moves. The gas mileage is fantastic for such a big car and uses 87 octane gasoline. In this day and age, the 87 octane saves you a lot of money. Orchids to lincoln for manufacturing a great automobile."

I love Town Cars for rear wheel drive, affordability, looks, great as mileage at 28 MPG, [with the Nitro filed tires] doing 65 - 70 miles per hour. The ride is like sitting at home in your easy chair. I keep my Lincoln Town Cars 10 years or more, even after I buy new ones. One of my best friends bought a new 2008 top of the line Lexus, and he said my TC gives a better ride than his car, for which he paid a bundle. When we have visitors from out of the country, visiting the USA, and I am asked to take them to the airport, they think they are riding in a limo.

lincoln,town-car,2006,Mr. Carkin, 06/03/2006,Simply Marvelous,4,"Although I have owned the 2006 Signature Limited Town Car for only five days, I feel that I should speak. I traded in a 2002 Town Car which I loved. As much as I loved the old car, the new car is firmer in handling, the ride is significantly improved, absorbing bumps with grace, and the car is as firm as can be on the road. It is a beautiful car to drive and to look at.  Improvements? Thicker visors, like the 2002, richer leather on the dash and other trim, real wood instead of plastic for the ""wood"" trim on the dash. The back seat could have a bit more standard leg room.  These are small issues for a car that is very pleasing to travel in and effortless to drive."

It truly is a masterpiece. I hope it lasts forever. Ford should not touch this car, in fear of ruining it! I love it, I get 31+ MPG on the highway, how can you beat that? I do find that if you drive this car prudently the mileage is ridiculously high for a car this size. However, if you drive it like a sports car, say goodbye to economy, and rightfully so! If you want to own and drive true American craftsmanship, made with pride, buy this car! You will not find a better car for the money. "
lincoln,town-car,2006,Lawrence K. Mahuna, 07/13/2008,"Last of the ""real"" American Luxury cars",5,"This Lincon Town Car has a beautiful ride and it does not pretend to be anything else but a comfortable ride.  It does not have 400+ horses, nor is it a sports car.  But if you want a car that gets you from point A-B in the most comfortable manner possible, chose the Town Car. I have a bad back and the Town Car makes it feel better after a long run and does not make you feel that you need a chiropractor. It is too bad that Ford is thinking of discontinuing the TC. Perhaps a litte more horses and a six speed transmission with electronic control would do the job. It would take so little to make this car attractive to new buyers."

lincoln,town-car,2006,Aaron Bouser, 06/18/2017,My 2nd big Ford,4,"I owned an 04 Crown Vic for a long time. I sold it to a friend and missed it, so I looked for another. Decent Crown Vic's are getting harder to find, but these Lincolns are quite available. I am really sold on the Panther platform, and the Lincoln is mechanically familiar to me. Durable and relatively simple.  I bought this car gently used, and I find that I like it more than the CV. It's a little bigger, a whole more comfortable, ride wise. Mine is a pewter, bluish silver color and I quite like it. The technology gap is a little behind some of my other vehicles, but they are newer. Mine has the back up beeper parking assist, which really works pretty well. It has a single CD player sound system. The sound, deep bass and crisp highs, is really good, but with no ""aux"" input, that really limits what I can listen to. That's kind of a downer, but hey, it is an older car.  One thing I love is the interior lighting. Each door has a light, each seat position has an overhead light and there's under dash floor lighting. Ten (10) lights come on when you turn on the interior lights. I like that..it looks cool. This car, like my CV, gets decent MPG's, especially for how big a car it is. It's whisper quiet inside and quiet enough that the guy at the carwash commented on it. The trunk is enormous. I play in a band, and it's got plenty of room for two electric guitars in cases, my amp, gig bag and pedalboard. I can carry all my music stuff in the trunk and not have to put any items in the passenger area. Nice. Plus, the air ride suspension keeps the car level even with a trunk load of heavy gear.  I love this car so far. The performance? It's not a drag racer and it stops like my pick up.  I don't want that kind of performance, though. I want a smooth, quiet ride. That's what I get with this car. After all, it's a Lincoln.

Had replaced twice, seems to be messing up again. A/C vacuum makes weird noises when car first started. On highway, car seems to sway a lot. This being the 3rd Town Car I've owned, this has the worst handling quality on highway (especially with full load of 6 people). Bumpers quality is not as good as previous models, maybe should consider purchasing a Crown Victoria or Grand Marquis for a cheaper price (cuz they are off the same assembly line!!)

Trouble with Moon Roof Installation, Draft around the front passenger doors, Electronic trunk opener, Bad odor from the A/C and horn unoperational due to new design on the steering wheel.

Same low horsepower motor (235 hp). All the new foreign luxury auto's have the power and speed to make a car fun to drive. Even the cadillacs have a powerful motor.

Regular maintenance ie: tune ups oil changes- Brakes, tires, gas tank replaced, was told this was somewhat common in older Lincoln’s. Had issues with moon roof switch, leave it closed now don’t use. Ac issue currently, didn’t address at end off summer last year. Need to address as soon as warmer weather sets in. Hope it’s nothing more then a Freon charge. This car has rust, good for a vehicle in Chicago. Keep in mind it’s garage kept and I’m a clean freak, so salt never remains in car for more then a couple of days or less. All this being said, this is my first ford vehicle ever owned. I’ve owned about 8 vehicles in my lifetime. All GM one Chrysler, never again on the lader, 4 of them being  Cadillacs. I liked all the  Cadillacs rides for sure, but  I have to say I had far more troubles with all of them and I’ve ever had with this Lincoln. When this carbno longer runs or I get in an accident I have no clue as to what car I would want to purchase. this is the car I want to drive for a long time to come,  I enjoy driving it that much.

I was a recent owner of a 2002 Cadillac and without a doubt, the Lincoln, by comparison, is not a Luxury Car.  The suspension was probably designed by an ex jeep designer...

The new styling, introduced in 2003, is one of the best I've seen on the road, and the ride is like no other vehicle in its class. Two thumbs up to the 2006 Lincoln Town Car!"

It is a very comfortable vehicle to drive.  I have owned BMW's and Mercedes Benz's, but I keep coming back to the Town Car.  I find them more economical to maintain and repair without sacrificing luxury and quality.  I would recommend the car to anyone.  After our first one, it is the only make of car that my wife wants to own. "

Without going into detail: the car has very adequate performance, gas mileage is equal to or surpasses many of the cars Edmunds refers to. My wife has an Infiniti Q45 and the Lincoln gets better fuel economy and I believe a more pleasant ride. I am glad to note that Edmunds is less critical of this car recently but one must be aware that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I base these comments on owning 2 Fords, 3 Mercurys and 3 Lincolns. AND they are all American made, mostly. Sorry to see the Towncar go by the wayside. Sorrowfully I cannot determine my replacement. I have driven all the new models Lincoln offers, blah!"

lincoln,town-car,2007,fred154, 11/06/2011,Solid performer with comfort,4,"Our 2007 Lincoln gives a roomy and comfortable ride with excellent trunk space and 23 MPG economy on a road trip and 18MPG around town.
It isn't the fastest car off the line, but a Lincoln owner is mature enough to know this isn't necessary or desirable.
It gives adequate performance when passing or getting up to speed on the interstates.
When you analyze what a car should do - transport a number of people in comfort and safety at a reasonable cost -
the Lincoln Town Car excels at that.
Our 92 Town Car gave excellent service for 15 years, and this one seems to be just as reliable.
Seats are comfortable and the features are great.

This car truly excels on the highway where the soft ride, excellent sound system and more than adequate power consumes miles without effort. I have owned Acura, Mercedes and other quality cars and for the money, they cannot match the TC. The interior is so large and comfortable you cannot compare it to any other car. The gas mileage is great for such a large car. On long trips I have averaged almost 25 mpg going 75 mph - all done on regular gas.  This car does everything extremely well at a very compelling price.

There is simply no ride quality to equal that of the town car. The engine is well refined and superior to the all aluminum NorthStar power plant of the Cadillac (which is well known now for its grievous unreliability.) This car is heavy, safe, and handles extremely well for its size. The fuel mileage is great for this car (avg. 25mpg on the road). It is sad to see this icon of American luxury go.

This vehicle met or exceeded all of my expectations. I have the Designer Series with the Nav and Moonroof. What a pleasure to drive this magnificent car. While detractors say that it is not the most technologically advanced car on the road, which is true,the sheer comfort, workmanship and room more than make up for the lack of having techno-gadgetry which in no helps getting in or out of an E350 or the ES350. Both cars technically advanced and miserable to ride in - especially the back seat. The Lincoln delivers true, reliable luxury. This won't the last."

lincoln,town-car,2007,3 in a row, 08/05/2007,Easy Rider,4,Solid as Grandpa's Reo but a lot easier to drive.  I'm a long distance type and take a couple of 3000 mile trips a year.   Nothing out there compares with the piece of mind and comfort steering this big beast through mountain roads and big city traffic.  This one is a duplicate of my 2003 but for some reason feels a little more solid if that's possible.  Cheapened the sun visors for some reason but seats seem softer and this radio which was a pretty cheap up grade is better than the $600 rig in my son's car. Other than that it's the same car.  I hate to keep hearing that Ford wants to drop the model.  The limo people must be worried.

Roominess and comfort are first class. I even like the style of the car, even though it's been around for awhile.

Each one has been a little better than the last. Such a shame that a great American classic will soon disappear, there is no equal on the road.

After four trips to the dealer over a three month span, and several different attempted solutions, the fix was to replace the fuel pump / fuel float device.

I've tried it in other cars (namely, my wife's Jaguar, the BMW that preceded it, and a Cadillac I purchased once in a moment of temporary insanity) and I'll take the Lincoln anytime.  Sure, other cars have lots of fancy technology.  Would be great if it worked, which has not been my experience.  Like I said, I've had 19 Lincolns and have never been stranded by a single one of them, nor even had a major repair for that matter.

I drove it on some smooth roads and I continued to notice the jerking. I have taken it to the dealer 3 times and now they are telling me that they worked for 2 days with ford and cannot figure out what is wrong. Ford is telling them that it is a nuance of how the car drives. I think its a computer flaw that the average driver does not feel. The shop foreman and a mechanic rode with me twice and they both felt what I was telling them. They still can't figure it out"

I have rented Town Cars in the 90's and thought I would rent a new one.  It was just built in June of 2009 with 6000 miles on it.  The engine had power but not the thrust of a Cadillac.  The air conditioning also seemed not as cold as a Cadillac.  The stereo had the Sirius satellite reception, but just had adequate sound.  The seat had lumbar, which previous versions didn't, but the seat cushion on the bottom was flat and needed more cushion.  The ride was a little harsh on bumps, I think the air suspension in the rear is to blame."

lincoln,town-car,2009,Jonathan Morris, 01/15/2009,Lincoln,2,"I purchased this vehicle last year with the input of my wife. Although it is a decent car, after shopping around I realize that my decision might have been ill advised. Not too long ago I took a look at the Acura RL. Offers over 300 hp from a V6 with all wheel drive. The interior quality is far superior as are the combination of 10 airbags, independent suspension and 200 k + Honda reliability. It's hard to believe but my Towncar uses a body on frame design and a live axle which makes for handling about as agile as a lumbering elephant compared to the Acura. My wife may not agree but with GM likely going under, the Towncar's time has come and gone."
lincoln,town-car,2010,sdbconsulting, 07/30/2010,Great Road Car,4,"Yes, yes, yes . It's an out of date design, it's an out of date platform, drive train, etc, etc . But for those of us who travel a lot, it's very comfortable, reasonable fuel efficient on the highway for the size (24 mpg), very safe, and I have found it to be as reliable as anything else I've owned (Benz, Volvo, Cadillac). I wouldn't pay the price for a new one, but I can buy one of these behemoths as a program car with a few miles on it for a reasonable price, still under warranty, put 100k miles on it in two years, then turn it and not lose too much money. Edmunds rates it a ""6"". Owners of the car rate it a ""10"". 'nuff said."

It handles like a tank, has no technology, has a pathetic engine, feels like your driving over grenades when you go over a bump, over priced for what you get- I could go on all day.

lincoln,town-car,2011,Tim, 12/26/2016,Classic cruiser,4,"Purchaesd a 2011 in December of 2015 for 1/4 the retail price to replace a 2003 Crown Victoria.  The dependability of the Ford made the purchase decision an easy one as I appreciated the simple roomy reliable qualities of the panther platform.  The car is a georgeous silver metallic with a black leather interior and extremely classy.  The car drives like a dream and feels like I am sitting on my couch at home, so much room.  When you pull it up into the garage, it's that comfortable that you really don't want to get out, at least that's what the wife says. :)  I have owned it for a year and have had to replace a light bulb, $10.00, a power lift gate latch $300.00, and a relay switch $160.00.  So far I am very pleased with the car for its ride, comfort and space. The relay switch although inexpensive to replace caused havoc for a week giving the dealership fits trying to trouble shoot a mystery battery drain that appeared to come from a light control module but was actually from the air conditioner.  The dealer's customer service far exceeded any I have ever had in the years of repairing vehicles.  Kudos to Lincoln.   I know that as vehicles become more and more technologically advanced as the years progress, my car, built on 1990's technology, will seem like a dud in comparison, and that's just fine with me.  I will have a classic sedan.... dependable, comfortable, simple, with all of the creature comforts you really need.  If any upgrades were to be made, an upgraded aftermarket Bluetooth, navigation setup would be all that's required.  Anticipate keeping this one for the next 6-7 years and if it's still going strong, will push it to 10.  When it's time to replace it, will there really be a car that can match the comfort and roominess because what's on the market now pails in comparrison....we shall see.

lincoln,town-car,2011,Vicki , 09/01/2010,Lincoln Town Car Reviews,4,"Yes, I agree with the comment that most Lincoln Towncars are sighted parked outside most major airports.  Being in the transportation business I  can honestly say that 2005-2007 Lincoln Towncars that are owned by this transporation company have over 300,000 miles, are in great shape exterior/interior wise.  Mechanical sound and up to the challenge of making the 140 mile round trip airport runs 2-3 times a day. It is our honest opinion that Lincoln has continued to make a superior product in the TownCar series."

lincoln,town-car,2011,geustis, 09/04/2011,Glacial Acceleration? Bad Mileage??,4,"According to my dash mileage computer, I'm averaging 26mpg highway (@70-75mph.) Thats 1mpg better than the turbocharged V6 in the MKZ which is remarkable considering the town car has the advantage in length, width and mass. 0-60 time is around 8 seconds. 8seconds! (This is not a sportscar). The car feels surprisingly nimble and light on its feet for such a large car. Cruising at eighty feels effortless and passing at 95 is easy. The suspension is designed for absorbing flaws in the road, but is adequate for swerving around a cinderblock lying on the freeway. "
lincoln,town-car,2011,Mickey, 05/29/2020,What a great car!,5,"I don't agree with the ""professional"" reviews.  Just got a 2011 as a third car with 88,000 in excellent shape.  Probably paid too much, but car drives great - PLENTY of power - and holds the road well.  Incredibly comfortable. It's not a BMW. Had two of them and I like my TC better.  In fact, I'm driving it more than my primary car, a late model Infiniti.  The TC is truly is a classic American car.  Check out Auto Europa and Doug DeMuro's reviews.  Those are legit reviews. I'm sure I will get many years of pleasant driving and REASONABLE costing repairs if need be.  Glad I bought it.

I’ve had both Town Cars and Crown Vics and will keep buying them as long as I live. You can keep your imports!!

lincoln,zephyr,2006,rblincoln, 05/28/2015,Excellent Luxury sedan,5,"After looking at the CTS and the BMW 5 series's I felt that they didn't stack up against Lincoln in terms of luxury and performance so I decided to go with the Zephyr, it's Comfortable smooth, and Reliable it has all of the features you need out of a luxury vehicle, I got mine fully loaded with the Navigation,Moonroof ect. $35,000 New. The seats are very comfortable, Excellent acceleration on the freeway the car just glides. Build quality is superb and haven't had any major issues, the car currently has 127,000 miles and I fully expect to get at least another 100,000 out of it, I always get compliments on it, if you are thinking about buying one you won't regret it."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,fitco, 12/27/2006,06 Zephyr 3500 miles,5,"This is one of the nicest cars I've ever owned. Quiet, great ride, ample performance, very surefooted on wet pavement, every option available and under $35K. No expense was spared on the interior. The car in and out is a flat-out show stopper. Everywhere I go, car wash, supermarket, etc. people stop me and want to know what it is and salivate over it. Handles very well. No problems with it so far. Gas mileage disappointing in the beginning (18 MPG around town) but went up to a consistent 22 MPG after about 2000 miles and have reached 28 MPG highway. Could be a little quicker off the line, but really moves once in motion. This car is definitely not a fluffy Fusion. It's all Lincoln."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Anthony, 07/29/2010,Classy,5,Have owned my Lincoln Zephyr for over 3 years and extremely satisfied with vehicle.  Never had to take back to dealer while under warranty since I've owned.  Exceptional highway mileage of 30mpg with regular gas and extremely smooth and comfortable.  Very stylish even though it's several years old now.  
lincoln,zephyr,2006,MarcusG, 06/07/2010,"Love my Zephyr, but ...",4,"Bought the Zephyr out of auction in 2008 and really have had very few issues with this car and have driven almost 60,000 miles in two years. Very comfortable, great AC, handles well (except in snow), love the heated and cooled seats (thought the cooled seats make you feel wet) and the gas mileage is not bad at all. Have had very few issues with this car with the exception of finding tires that work and don't make a ton of noise, and tires for snow. This car does not do well in the snow without snow tires. Turning radius is horrific, though. My wife's huge SUV has a better turning radius. I'm surprised there aren't more complaints. Otherwise, totally satisfied. "

The only thing that I feel could be improved is that the front seats are too small for my frame on a long trip. I am 6' 3"" and weigh 225. Although the Zephyr is my wife's car and she loves it especailly the GPS system. WE do like to take it on trips in excess of 400 miles and that is where it becomes un comfortable for me. Besides that I feel the Zephyr is a solid vehicle. I suppose we will need to look for a larger Lincoln perhaps a MKS, we shall see. Thanks for listening  Edward & Alice  Edward & Alice"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,CharlieO, 09/22/2009,"Better Than The ""Experts"" Think It Is",4,"I have read numerous reviews of the 2006 Zephyr in magazines and newspapers, and almost all of them were unenthusiastic.  Most claimed that the Zephyr is just a dressed up Milan, and some are critical of the performance or the interior styling.  I studied these reviews before buying the car, but then I took a couple of test drives to decide for myself.  I compared it to competing cars from Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, and Audi, and decided that FOR ME the Zephyr is the best choice. It handles well, looks great, and has been extremely reliable.  After 3 years on the road, the Zephyr is at the top of the JD Powers quality survey, and is rated highly by Consumer Reports.  Buy one, you'll like it!"

lincoln,zephyr,2006,RBS, 11/03/2009,Somethings Missing,4,"Came out of an LS to the Zephyr. I know we are comparing apples and oranges but Lincoln really missed the mark if trying to retain customers who came to the brand for mid performance. LS was tight and confident. Zephyr is not even close. Zephyer is luxury inside while the vehile is in park. Awesome interior, no mechanical issues, great looks and finish. Step on the gas and it ends here. Loud unrefined engine noise, unremarkable ride, major torque steer. This is a Fusion at best with a better interior. Nothing wrong with this except why pay for luxury and get a common auto mobile. After 7 weeks I traded it out."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Nook Schreier, 08/19/2009,These are a few of my favorite things,4,"I bought my pre-owned Zephyr over 4 months ago, and I still smile when I walk up to it, it's just fantastic. It's such a classy-looking car, ESPECIALLY in black, which mine is. Unfortunately, being black, the birds seem to enjoy hanging out above it... often.  It's very fun to drive, though as has been pointed out repeatedly, the gas mileage leaves something to be desired.  I live pretty close to work and don't drive a whole lot otherwise, so I'm getting about 17mpg regular.  But on the highway, I have gotten 30mpg, so that's something. I've read reviews saying the acceleration is bad, but I haven't really experienced that, if you drive it intelligently (don't slam the gas/squeal tires)."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Marc, 12/30/2009,"Looks nice, very rough trans",3,"My Zephyr looks great. I put 20"" rims and low profile tires from the start and the car looks great. The tires the dealer sold me were horrible (Nitto) but I replaced them with Michelins that are much better.  Car is comfortable and rides fairly well on the freeway. I always get people telling me they love how it looks too.  The biggest problem is the transmission and the poor fuel economy. The transmission has been poor from the start, with very jerky upshifting almost predictable when trying to accelerate from a rolling 40 MPH. The transmission actually jerks so hard that the car almost comes off the ground. I am really not looking forward to that repair bill that come inevitably."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Starr, 06/28/2006,I love it!,4,"I just traded in my 2004 CTS.  I love the Zephyr.  It DOES have stability, so I dont know why the reviews on Edmunds says otherwise.  That is not true at all.  Also, I hate the fact that Lincoln will change the name to some stupid letter bearing name.  What the hell is that about.  I should be happy though, because my ZEPHYR will be special!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,B. Welch, 05/02/2006,Our Zephyr,5,Zephyr is one great car!  We've had ours for just over one month and it has been a joy to drive.  The interior is extremely comfortable and very tastefully done (stone colour combination is great).  The exterior styling is what caught our interest in the Zephyr.  Great job Lincoln!  On the highway it provides an extremely smooth and quite ride.  It cruises effortlessly.  There is lots of passing power and gas mileage has been excellent.  The THX sound system is awsome! The Zephyr is well assembled with no flaws.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Ken, 09/02/2006,Wife Loves It,4,"Had looked at a number of other sedans but kept coming back to Lincoln due to the quality. I had also read a number of reviews and they did help. I understood that, like most other models sticker claims, the gas mileage would be less than stated. But, it's close enough not to be a major concern. It looks great, rides comfortably and inside looks just right."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Michelle, 06/14/2006,Bad,3,"There are big time steering problems with this vehicle.  Without four lanes forget a u-turn.  Pulling into a parking space requires that you backup and correct.  Hard to believe it has rack and pinion steering!   The engine sounds like a tinker toy not that of a $30,000 luxury car.  Forget having to accelerate quickly when merging onto the interstate or turnpike.  At 52, I would I was more consumer savvy.  Wrong!"

Sharp, sporty looking car!
Mine is dark gray & has the light gray interior.
The car had a slight worn
spot in what appeared to be a seam on the left hand side of the upper drivers seat.
In time the worn spot appeared to stretch & you could see fibers & then the dye in the leather started to come off in just that one small section.
I paid $400 to have the upper seat
leather replaced.
 It happened again & they took the cover back and gave me another.
Now, less than 6 mos. later it is doing the same thing.

I have driven it all over and on two long trips (5K miles) since then and still like it a lot. This US car is better than any Toyota or Honda and is comparable to the Lexus. It drives great, gets good MPG (26-30 hwy), runs very quiet and is very reliable. It is great car for a couple or a small family with lots of trunk room and a big back seat for extra junk or two kids or two friends as needed. The car is very luxurious and great looking on both the inside and outside. I highly recommend it to all my friends.  "

Almost every day total strangers just walk up and start asking about it; one lady actually came up to me and asked me if she could sit in it. People give me the thumbs up when I'm driving down the road. I've been waiting for Lincoln to enter this category for a loooooooonng time; it was worth the wait. Driving it is a great experience. On the highway it cruises like a much larger car, and off the freeway it handles the demands of city/suburban driving with incredible agility. Handsome, well-mannered, athletic, and adult. Not your father's Lincoln."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Mariella Lohman, 03/13/2006,Whispered Elegance,4,"This quiet, elegant, classy car speaks volumes, without saying a word. When I first came upon it without even looking, I felt a ""connection"". I've owned the 5-speed flashy cars, the red cars, too many white cars and big SUV's -- (not conducive to wearing skirts!) It was time for me to show some style and I've done that in my brand new classic black, oyster leather interior, Lincoln Zephyr.  I brought it home and just stared at it for 2 days and then I took it out on a Saturday night by myself and drove through town playing ""Enya"" on my fabulous stereo very loud.  Then I clicked over to CD #3 and ""Start Me Up"", classic Stones. My genre, my style. That's me pulling up in whispered elegance..."

I am very impressed with everything about it. Gets lots of looks, but its not gaudy. Lincoln has a notion of sophistication.  Everything from Cooled/Heated seats, automatic Up/Down widows, comfortable seats and high quality seat and dash materials, awesome fit and finish! I drive over 27k per year in city and highway, so I am very stringent on what I buy. Better materials inside than BMW, more power and no 'tin box' feel like Lexus.  This car performs well, shifts are dead-on, steering is tight, lights on and off highway are bright, regular (87) gas, comfortable, very roomy and open feeling. Plus it's American! A+"

Have had the car for two weeks and I am liking it more and more each day. The ride is extra quiet even when doing 65 on the freeways and the stereo is out of sight.

It felt cheap. I looked at the Lexus ES330. I liked it, but I couldn't justify paying more than 30K for a comfortable Camry. I felt lost but knew I was in no true hurry since my Lincoln still had some life left. Then, I stumbled on news of a new model Lincoln.

You'd expect to run this on premium.  Guess again. Only a couple minor gripes.  The plastic in the gear box is cheap feeling, and I'd expect a locking fuel door.

Since day one of ownership the car has idled very high after sitting for more than a couple of hours! It takes several minutes for the car to idle down on its own! Have been to the dealer and they say all is fine! My mileage is now dismal and I believe it is due to the high idle every morning and afternoon. 2006 was the only year this particular engine was used.I've talked to other owners of 2007-08 models they have no problems. They also have more power as Lincoln added about 43 horsepower! A friend drove my car and thought it was a 4 cylinder!"

Quality is amazing....Cadillac should learn for this... especially in the interior segment. When I buy a luxury car I expect it to look better than a base every day economy car. Cadillac interiors are no nicer than something you would find on a Chevy Colbalt econo-box. Add some wood and leather and you got a Cadillac. Lincoln went ahead and provided a full new interior; can you spot a ford fusion part? I cant...in the end this a excellent car and the price is just as stunning as the car (in a good way)

Great value for the money."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,PAMELA HENDON, 01/24/2006,Surprised,5,"This the first ford i have owned , i usually buy G.M. Products.  However this auto rides almost like my dhs cadillac. This auto is very comfortable,tight,very little road noise. Looks great very sporty. Fun to drive. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Danville Owner, 02/06/2006,Excellent Build Car,5,"This car handles great, looks great and rides excellent. Everyone that sees it just loves the look and the sleek body style. It has plenty of room and the sound system is out of this world. The grand children just love this car. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Werner Redel, 02/07/2006,A Great New Lincoln,5,This car is one of the quietest cars I have driven to date. More options than any other car in its class and most are standard. The THX sound system and Navigation system are out of this world. I was surprised there was more room inside this car then the Lincoln LS. The Workmanship on this car is the best I have seen including the imports.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Wayne, 02/07/2006,Perfect fit & finish...truly WOW,4,"have had the car for a month...not a thing wrong yet...love the design, comfort, features and design are fantastic at a fair price.  We ordered the car without seeing the color we wanted (dark blue) and love it and the interior color too (light stone).  The car is really fun to drive and has plenty of power despite the reports...handles very smoothly..."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Gary, 02/24/2006,Selectred After a Long Search,4,"I have only owned this car about a month but my first impressions are very positive.  I test drove and evaluated many other cars before making my deicison.  This car has more standard features for the price then its competition.  Plus its a new look which people notice on the road.  I was a bit concerned that it might be underpowered but after driving it for a while, although its no performance car, the 6 speed transmission helps in getting the car up to speed adequately.  Don't let that stop you from buying this car.  It's comfortable with enough room, has all the features you could ever want and still stickered for only $35K.  The navagation system is great, my first one, I recommend it.  "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,John H, 02/27/2006,Zephyer vs CTS,5,"I was looking for an entry level luxury car that wouldn't break the bank.  Well, I found it.  I thought the CTS was going to be my choice but once I test drove the Zephyer it was all over.  The car has a sophisticated look of an import and the interior is extremely impressive.  Nothing like it in its class. Car handles like a dream, has lots of standard features ( 15 of them you won't get with the CTS -  compare at cars.com).I highly reccomend seeing and driving this car before the purchase of the cadillac.  My guess, 9 out of 10 will choose the Zephyer. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Rob, 03/10/2006,Nice Work!!,5,"Extremely pleased with this car.  First looked at the Mercury Montego, but for only a couple thousand more the decision was easy.  It is quick and rides real smooth."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Harold Bussing, 03/14/2006,This is great,4,So far this has been a great car.  I have not had to return to the dealer for  single problem.  The fit and finish are excelent.  It has most of the bells and whistles too.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,LisaB, 03/27/2006,Just not sure yet????,4,"I just traded in my 2000 Infiniti I30 which I just loved and unfortunately miss after purchasing the Zephyr.  I don't think the Zephyr is as sporty as I would like, but it is classy. I enjoy the heated seats and the sound system. I enjoy the smooth ride, but miss the sporty look and feel of the I30. I have no desire to go out and joy ride with this car.  I've only owned it a week and think I'm still going through withdrawal of giving up my I30, so time will tell. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,ink 74, 03/29/2006,My Best Buy so far,4,"I had this car for 4 months and i love it the ride is very smooth, the THX sound system is great, i love the cooled seat because where i live we have 90 to 100 degrees, the interior is beautyfull, it has more than enough power, it looks great, it handles great, the cockpit is quiet but when the engine goes around the 3,500 rpm the sounds turns loud and thats something that i love, this is the first lincoln made for young buyers because it has what it takes to compite with the germans and overprice japanese "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Crusin Zephyr, 03/28/2006,Cruising in the wind,5,Having owned this car for two weeks has been great fun. The black on black combination is a real head turner.The performance and handling both have exceeded my expectations.  If Tiffany & Company sold cars this would definitely be a jewel in the blue box!  
lincoln,zephyr,2006,SoCalBob, 04/07/2006,Love my Lincoln,5,"I looked at Lexus, Infiniti, and Cadillac. This Linclon is the greatest car to date. It is great to see an American car company get it so right. The ride is wonderful, the premium sound system is the best. I couldn't be happier. On top of all that I had the best buying experience with my dealer. The treatment was first class all the way!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Doc, 04/20/2006,Great Car,4,Great interior and driving features; nice style and size; excellent build quality; competitively priced.  Fun to drive and easy to like.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Sam K, 05/08/2006,Great American Sport Sedan,4,Had a BMW 528I for 8 years prior to buying the Lincoln Zephyr. This car matches up very well feature for feature with the Japanese and German cars. The big difference is the value. This car offers as much for thousands less. The sign and drive deal was the icing on the cake. I admit I had a bias towards American nameplates. 
lincoln,zephyr,2006,TCR, 05/09/2006,I like my Zephyr,5,Great vehicle for the price.  Had 2 Mercedes prior to this car.  I can't see $10K+ difference if any  Average fuel economy to date for the 4300 miles is a respectable 26.43 mpg
lincoln,zephyr,2006,fredco, 05/09/2006,Zephyrlove,5,"I absolutely love this car.  Great gas mileage, comfortable, quiet, good handling and great to look at both inside and out.  Drove Deville's before but find this car more pleasurable to drive.  Bought car the day after Christmas and it has been perfect so far.  I couldn't be more satisfied."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,pete, 05/20/2006,cant beat this car !!,5,"excellent luxury model, with better than average gas mileage. I tested the acura tl, and the saab 9-3, both nice cars, but the zephyr blows them away.The zephyr reminds me of the classic heavy ride i used to get with the older vehicles, such as the caddy and the bigger v8 cars, but without the gas guzzling."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Dan Guio, 06/03/2006,Exceeds expectations in most areas,4,"The car is tight, solid, and quiet. Unlike the mushy accelerator pedal on many new cars, this one supports my foot.  The cooled seats really work and feel better than I expected.  It's fun to drive, easy to park, and has an interior that always gets compliments from first time guests.  The THX entertainment system with 14 speakers was definitely worth the extra money.  This may be the first car (out of 5) that I may buy at the expiration of my 3-year lease."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,FERNANDO CAMPO, 06/03/2006,Performance,4,"Good car all around, use too much gas, and the shocks are hard when you hit a bumper. Very quiet car great interior and exterior. Great car"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Paul Barnes, 06/03/2006,Very Happy with the Zephyr,5,I purchased the Zephyr for my wife-both she and I are very happy with it. We have had several people who are very impressed with it and who have told us so. We traded a LS (2002) for it and plan to own it for 5 to 6 years.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,KD, 06/07/2006,Beautiful!!,5,I traded in my Cadillac CTS for this car and am even more pleased.  I had to get my windows tinted because I had so many people stopping by the car and riding directly next to me on the highway just to gawk.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,rOY, 06/14/2006,Love vehicle,4,"Purchased this lincoln in april 2006. I have owned lincolns for years - Town car, continentals -  i like this vehicle best of all"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Steve, 06/28/2006,Best Ride I've Ever Had,5,"Got this car several weeks ago: the best ride I have ever had.  The design is great, it's a pretty car (my wife loves it), but the creature comforts are awesome. The THX stereo w/17 speakers is the best I have ever had, in or out of the car.  The Navigation system is incredible.  Climate control is as good as it has been for over 10 years on Ford company vehicles.   On top of all that, it is a great ride, with great response, acceleration.  Nimble and fast.  What a car: I can't praise it enough. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,connie, 06/28/2006,my 2006 lincoln zephyr,4,"styling id great, however the economy thus far does not live up to expectations. we average 22 mpg, even on experssway. can't this be improved?"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Great Vehicle, 07/03/2006,More to Come,4,I truly enjoy this vehicle. The ride is smooth and everything about this vehicle says quality. Although it seems that I need to fill the tank every four or so days it's well worth it.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,ndb3, 07/05/2006,Great fun car!,5,"Great fun car, no problems, relaible, everyone asks what it is and where I got it!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,DFW, 07/10/2006,Great Value - good luxury,4,"Have had the Zephyr nearly 3 months and have enjoyed it.  I did have to replace the steering whell due to the leather wrap starting to peel off.  Turning radius is average.  The car does have some pep if you get on it.  The steering wheel controls are excellent and allow more freedom to switch radio stations, media, a/c etc. than many competitors.  It's hot in the south, thus the a/c in the seats are awesome."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Freddy H, 07/10/2006,Great but not Terrific,4,Although a great driving experience with head turning good looks it is not perfect. Rear vision is a problem and the center arm rest is out of position. It would also be nice to have the steering wheel mounted controls more readable but overall an excellent choice of vehicles. It is my wife's car but I drive it as often as possible.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,John, 07/22/2006,"WOW,,what a great car",5,"Without question the best car I have ever owned.  Have had LSs, Town Cars, you name it, FORD has however delivered a winner."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Kentucky Fried, 07/27/2006,We love our Zephyr,5,"We purchased our black Zephyr 4 weeks ago and we just love it.  It is a car that you notice on the road, very sophisticated yet sporty. Gas mileage is great both city and highway. Offers a tight drive and comfotable ride."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Ralph, 08/02/2006,Great Car,5,"I purchased the Zephyr to replace my Mercury Sable that seems to last forever and just keeps going. Most noticable about the Zephyr is the quiet and comfortable ride. Bumps and road noise have just about disappeared.  I have the standard sound system that seems adequate for FM but is outstanding with CD's. It is embarrassing to get so many stares of approval as I drive around. The trunk is large enough to hold an entire order from Costco with room to spare.  The air conditioned seat makes me feel like my pants are wet, but is quite effective. The air conditioner is quite powerful even in 99 degree weather. My only complaint is that the vision in the rear is poor, like most other 2006/7 cars."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Rich Sera, 08/05/2006,Great Design,4,"This car is a very comfortable, nicely equipped vehicle. Itsinterior is well designed. The fit & finish are comparable to any other car. Quiet, smooth ride with a solid feel. Very little lean in turns."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Thomas E. Cuomo, 08/18/2006,Great Car for the Price,4,I've only had this car for a short time but I like it very much. I had a Town Car which I loved but I wanted to downsize and this car is perfect. There is a lot interior room and trunk space. The car is loaded with options that I didn't have in my Town Car. It has a great looking interior. The ride is very good for a car this size.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Stan H., 08/21/2006,Best Luxury Car Value Around,5,"My new Zephyr has so many great features I couldn't list them all. Great proportions,  Drives like a bigger/heavier car, and so far seems to be well on track to rival my favorite (up until now) car I ever owned. (Which incidentally was also a Lincoln) It truly drives like a Lincoln affectionado would expect it to drive. To top it off I had a great purchase experience with the dealer, although I had to drive 30 miles to get it. (Local dealers always try to pad the price with charges to have the car transfered etc.) I dont see why so many think it is to similar to the Milan/Fusion sure there are similar beginings, but all car manufacturers do that. (Honda/Acura..Toyota/Lexus)"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,M J H, 11/02/2005,First on the Block,5,"Just picked up our new Zephyr.  Great looking car.  Front wheel drive was the major appeal and we found much more.  There are only a handful of options to choose, so fully loaded you are looking at about $35,000.  Compared to my Mercedes S500 it doesn't have all the bells & whistles, but it has heated & cooled front seats, a great audio system, and a navigation system at less than half the price.  They were even offering incentives.  You can't ask for more on a new model! "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,kwilsonict, 11/23/2005,Almost Perfect!,5,"Although I've only had it for a week, I'm overall very pleased with my Zephyr. I love the styling outside and inside, it seems to be a well built vehicle, and the gas economy isn't bad for a brand new car, averaging about 23 MPG combined city/highway now. It handles well on the highway and in city driving, and it rides great. More horsepower would add to its appeal, but it handles highway passing and other quick maneuvers without problem. It's listed as a 5 passenger car, but don't plan on an adult sitting in the middle of the back seat for very long. Fit and finish are excellent. It's worth your time to check out if you're looking for a vehicle in this class! "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,A. Curcio, 11/26/2005,Lincoln Zephyr,5,"Runs on 87 Octane which is a plus. Has traction control and handles very good. A giantic trunk!, fold down seats and heat and air cooled seats. I thin it is a great buy for the money"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,2006 Lincoln Zephyr, 11/29/2005,Good Looker,5,"This vehicle is fantastic.  When I purchased this vehicle, I had not done any research on it.  I trusted the Sales Manager and was he right.  The Zephyr is sporty and really gets the looks.  I have had individuals come up to the car to take a look inside.  I travelled over the Thanksgiving holiday and people were passing me on the interstate to take a look at the front end.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a sporty yet comfortable ride."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Rudy, 12/16/2005,Great Car,5,I have just purchased this car and drove it home to the Florida Keys. Wow this is a great car and what a great value for all this is included. Mine was fully loaded with sun roof and navigational system.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Al, 12/17/2005,Relaxing Roads Across the Southwest,5,Drove my wife and I and our two dogs from PHX to DFW and had the best trip ever. Comfort was wonderful and the car handled well in all aspects. Very quiet at freeway speeds. THX stereo kept the music flowing pleasantly. The GPS navigation was fun and helpful. The power seats allowed adjustments to both seating position and temperature to keep us both comfy for the two thousand mile round trip. The moon roof can be open at high speed for great ventilation with very little noise.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Haller, 12/20/2005,Great car to enjoy for the price,5,"Quiet ride, no wind noise, very little engine noise, good acceleration, excellent sound system, good gas mileage,221 Hp sufficient for any driving in the USA. Unless you want it for Europe to drive 120 MPH. Navigation system very helpful in finding your way. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,06zephyr, 01/12/2006,WOW,5,"Simply an awesome vehicle...well worth the money incredible ride quality, comfortable and quiet Ford has really done this right, the foreign segments now have some decent competition "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,ali saleh, 01/15/2006,best lincoln,5,this is a amaziing car i have it fully loaded with navigation. it gets excellent gas mileage has a true sedan ride but with a sports car handling. i truly recomend this car. sincerely Saleh M.D
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Retired Teacher, 01/25/2006,Love Our Zephyr,5,"We love the design and maneuverability of our Zephyr.  We recently drove it over 2000 miles to Florida and back, and the only thing we found a little lacking was the seat comfort.  Having owned three Lincoln Continentals prior to the Zephyr, we think there could be a little more padding in the seat bottoms.  Other than that, we were very impressed with it -- as were our six nephews and nieces, all ""30 something young urban professionals.""  Many people driving beside us caused traffic backups because they slowed down to have a look at the Zephyr.  One person speeded up to look at the front, then dropped back beside it, and then pulled in back to check out the rear design."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,laurenm, 01/17/2006,love my car,4,"With 2 kids in private school and money not flowing like it did in the olden days, I thought I was going to be depressed having to ""step down"" into a vehicle other then the jaguars,bmw's and mercedes that have spoiled me for years. All I can say is that i absolutely LOVE this car. It's more comfortable, has a smoother ride and has more bells and whistles then any car I've ever owned. The sound system is awesome, the dash is sexy, the pick- up is amazing and I can literally fall asleep in the comfortable seats if I'm not careful. The navigation system is brilliant and there is more room in the backseat then I originally thought. Color choices go on and on too."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Zephyr Owner, 01/28/2006,Love my Zephyr,5,My new Zephyr handles really well in town as well as on the highway.  I also love the styling -- I've had many other drivers really check it out as they have passed me on the highway.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Jawmeat, 02/10/2006,Zephyr vs LS,5,"After owning a '2000 LS V-8 for 3yrs I was a little bit reluctant to even consider downgrading to a Zephyr.  Today, I am proud to say its one of the best decisions I've made in a while.  The car is awesome.  It has everything I was looking for(affordibility, comfort, performance, and lots of attitude). I compared this vehicle to the CAdillac CTS, Lexus Es300,Mercedes Benz E320, and the MAxima.  None of them gave me what I wanted.  "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,David F. Butler, 02/14/2006,Zephyr: a value in luxury,5,"Finally an american car manufacturer has met and beat the foreign competition in the mid-size luxury market.  The Lincoln Zephyr is truly an amazing vehicle.  It has the power,design and luxury amenities of a $40,000 vehicle for about $30,000.  The exterior style is impressive. The interior is even more impressive and would meet the discerning taste of the most discriminating car buyer.  My only complaint is that XM radio is not available."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,ewp400, 02/18/2006,Lincoln Zephyr surpasses competition,5,"Top level for performance, comfort, amenities, quietness, handling.  Better than the competition.  "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Rugsmart, 02/17/2006,American Luxury,4,"Both GM and Ford have come out with some nice cars for 2006 and I wanted to give them both a good shot with my new car purchase.  The Lincoln Zephyr is more engaging than the Lexus ES, and while not as much fun to drive as the Lexus IS or BMW 325, it comes in at a good $2,000-$3,000 less comparably equipped (after negotiation and dealer contributions, which don't exist on the other name plates). The main reason I like the Lincoln is its unique sense of American luxury.  It is not trying to be European or Japanese, it is trying to establish a new American Luxury character, and I think it succeeds very well.  It is very quiet (tire noise from the front is the only sound) and takes regular gas."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Joe, 02/20/2006,Awesome!!!,4,"My Mom recently got this for a christmas present, and it is AWESOME. It handles like a charm and takes the corners very well. Shifts well and is very comfortable. Seat warmers are a plus this time of year. Getting 13.6 MPG, but motor only has 1300 miles on it."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Tracel2000, 03/03/2006,Won me over The Zephyr is a perfect fit,5,"At 32 years old, I am probably on the young end of the range for Lincolns target population for the new Zephyr, but the car fits me like a glove.  After testing many (and I do mean many) cars, and dealing with the exasperating car salesman, I could not pass up the Zephyr.  I traded in my 01 Lincoln LS for the Zephyr, and although I lost some horse power, I gained a sportier feel and better gas mileage, while maintaining the comfort and style of a Lincoln.  I found it not only responsive on the back roads, but also smooth, quite and comfortable on the highway; much more so than the Cady CTS (This was important to me, due to the fact that I spend much of my time on the road)."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Randy, 03/06/2006,Zephyr is Great.,5,"Zephyr is a great car. It has surpassed my expectations. It is better than Lexus, BMW or Mercedes Benz."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,FreeJohn, 03/07/2006,Affordable Luxury,4,"Lincoln has a quality product in the 2006 Zephyr.  Great ride, luxiourious interior and features such as Air Conditioned Seats, HID lamps, Navi, THX II Certified Audio and 17"" Chrome rims for under $35K.  Very quiet highway ride and surprisingly good handling on local winding roads.  Local driving averaging about 21 MPG and the 12 month maintenance package with 50K warranty makes the Zephyr even more attractive.  "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,bob turk, 03/15/2006,a great new car,5,"this car is fun to drive. It corners very well . For a 6 cyl it has excellent passing ability. Engineering  has done an excellent job of matching the gears to the car.  The interior is very pleasing to look at, and it is  easy to see the controls at night. I would not hesitate to buy another one. I have put on 4900 miles on since november, and enjoyed every minute of them . A marvelous car for the money."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,gepfund, 03/15/2006,You've GOT to CHeck this one OUT!,5,"Well I just traded in my Jaguar X-type for the new Zephyr(I wish they would keep this name) who wants a mark Z???  I don't get it. Anyway, This car is really unbelievable. It has almost every fun option I would want on a car. You have to get the navigation and THX system. It's like front row seats at a movie or concert. All of you beamer, acura, lexus and audi lovers Talk to me when you can have Air conditioned seats. I have test driven almost every model out there in the 30,000 dollar area and as far as styling, fit and finish, options, you just can't beat this. The first day I had this car three people came up to me to tell me what a great looker it is. Try that in a Acura or lexus. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,H.Haller, 03/16/2006,A nice car for the money,5,Good riding car. Good acceleration. easy handling. Nice appealing interior. Excellent sound system.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,jonszephyr, 03/31/2006,zephyr comments,5,"excellant car,drives like a lincoln should. would like side mirrors to go in the down position for curb finding,would like electric trunk closure, and would like gas compartment opener.otherwise great car. one other problem with ford cars is the fact you cant get the accessories for their cars, all other car manufacturers don't have this problem "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,mike35z, 04/02/2006,2006 Lincoln Zephyr review,5,"This is a wonderfull car to drive and just enjoy.  I have the standard audio system in it, (not the THX), and it is excellent, clear and vibrant sound, has unique audio tuning features.  The car is very quiet, I used to own a Grand Marquis, and the Zephyr is quieter then the Grand Marquis.  The ride quality is very nice, handling is very precise, and acceleration is splat on the money, no lag.  I highly recommend this car."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,S.Schermer, 04/13/2006,My New Zephyr,5,Over the past ten years I have gone from the Mercury to Linoln LS and now I this past Feburary I acquired my new Lincoln Zephyr. The gas mileage in the city has been 22 MPG and on the highway with the use of Cruise Control it was 28 MPG. I have Air Condition Seats and this is just one of the extras and this is fair. 
lincoln,zephyr,2006,TED ARCADO, 04/12/2006,New Owner's Impression,4,"The price is right.  We like the general design and overall assembly of the vehicle.  Although the power is at least adequate, engine noise under high acceleration is somewhat excessive.  The seats and other interior details are all that we expect from a car of this level and price.  It compares very favorably and in many cases better than the Lexus ES 300 we previously owned and really liked.  "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Lorna LV, NV,Love the Lincoln Zephyr,5,"I Love my Jaguar, but this car is nice! So quiet and elegant.  People look at it all the time as if to say ""What is that car?!""  We were very happy with the standard options found on this car.  We looked, drove, bought. That simple!  Nice, too, that it is an American manufacturer.  Way to go!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Luv It, 04/28/2006,We Luv It!,5,"We bought this car in March for my wife and WE LUV IT.  Yes I said WE.  I drive the car every chance I get but it is suppose to be her car.  The look of the car is vary similiar to the CTX but I think this car gets you equal or better looks, more options, and equal or better quality.  This car is sweet.  If you get a chance to test drive one of these do it before you buy something else...you'll LOVE IT."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,GoBucks79, 04/28/2006,I love this car,4,"I have fallen in love with turning, for me the right turn, very tight, is the best.  I have a Corvette, but I love the Zypher's handling.  And in the process I find it to be very peppy.  I think 226 HP, V6.  Turning also seems to be assisted in that you do not turn the wheel far to make a big turn.  Ride is great not mushy like some Ford's.  My parents Town Car floats, the Zypher is very much on the ground.  Interior is delightful.  My Mom bought one, traded in that Town Car within two weeks of my purchase.  My wife hogs it completely, have not driven it in two weeks!!!!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,J C Miller, 04/29/2006,J C Miller,5,I have driven BMW and Mercedes they are both nice cars this car is just as nice and more affordable. The suspension is tuned just right it has a smooth ride but handles well on the back roads. The seats are comfortable and fully adjustable. The heated and cooled seats are a nice touch you cant find on more expensive cars.I find myself looking for excuses to drive this car it is truly a joy to drive.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Keith, 05/03/2006,Great Car Finally takes on the Japanese,4,Performance is fine could use a little more HP.. But gas Mileage is good. THX is unreal. Handling is great. Interior is American all the way. love it. Air conditioned seats nav ststem unreal comfort A++....Buying a VETT soon and the Lincoln is for the Family have fun
lincoln,zephyr,2006,mike nicholls, 05/13/2006,happy as a Lark(Zephyr),5,"I purchased this vehicle for my wife. its size,great looks and comfort were the deciding factors.The pricing i thought was good. all the bells and whistles offered were purchased for under 36k out the door, she also liked the Acura TL but the exta 25 cent a gal for prem. gas was the deciding factor. Both vechiles were priced similarly and are good buys compared to others in their class we also wanted to help the econmy by buying American.  Mike"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Jesus C., 05/12/2006,Fun to drive!!!,5,"I have had this car for almost a week and so far it has performed better than any other car I've owned. Acceleration is responsive. According to the salesman the computer system will adapt the gear shifting to my style of driving. This is why it does not have a manual shifting option. Doors open and close with little effort. I researched the Acura TL, Cadillac CTS, Dodge Charger, Chrysler 300, Toyota Camry, and the Nissan Maxima.  The closest that compared to the Zephyr is the Maxima 3.5 SL version.  The drawback of the Maxima is it's interior style.  Zephyr int/ext combo is by far the best for the price.  I'm definitely looking forward to keeping this car for a long time."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,ken, 05/16/2006,No more Nissans,5,"This is our first ""American made"" car since the mid 1980's and we are extremely pleased.  We looked at the Lexus ES series and found the Zephyr just about equal in quality but much more affordable.  The THX sound system is awesome, the heated and cooled, memory controlled seats are a nice touch, the instruments easy to read,the ride very comfortable, the pickup more than satisfactory and it roomy and fun to drive.  We also have the moon roof that operatates with one touch and is surprisingly quiet when open.  Our Zephyr also has the 17"" chrome wheels and they sparkle.  My wife uses the car daily and has been asked several times about the vehicle.  It's a real head turner."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Rudy, 05/25/2006,A Really Great Car,5,I have had this car for over  six months now and everything about it has been great. It is fun to drive and is very comfortable. Just returned from a trip and averaged 26.8 MPG. I am glad to see that the American manufacturer has put out a quality product that is not only competitive when it comes to quality and style but also a true value for the price.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,John Hanna, 05/29/2006,Switch from an Avalon,5,"We have owned the Zephyr for a month. Handling is better than an Avalon. We traded an Avalon for the Zephyr. The ride is quiet. The style is one that  people notice. The sound system and navigation system are fine additions. My wife, who drives it more than I do, and I are happy we purchased the Zephyr."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Paul Lehman, 05/30/2006,My Zephyr,4,"The car is very easy to drive, it has a good turning radius. It gets as good and some times better then advertised gas mileage. I am over all very pleased with its looks and driveabilty."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,maxgaskin, 05/31/2006,Lincoln Zephyr,5,"The car is quieter than we expected, it handles better than some much larger cars, we own two larger cars (jaguar VDP and lincoln Nav.) it's just fun to drive.The size gives you a feeling of control and freedom, we're just pleased with its performance."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Led Zephyrlin, 06/09/2006,Pleasantly Surprised,5,"My first American Luxury car. Considered Acura TL/TSX, Infinity and Lexus offerings. Price point and design made Zephyr most appealing, no cookie cutting. Exterior design jaw dropping gorgeous. Classy name and interior styling. Very solid build with a quality interior makes driving quite enjoyable. Love the AC in the seats (gets hot here in GA). Plesant experience at the dealership. Very quiet ride even at 70 mph interstate speed. Positive feedback in the corners, secure feeling from brake system. Overall Zephyr is well balanced when compared to competing models. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Jim, 06/22/2006,Great Car - Great Price!,5,"Purchased the car with all available options except I passed on replaceing the real wood interior trim with brushed crome. Put Mobil 1 Synthetic oil in and pumped up the tires to 42 psi. (The Michelins are max rated at 44 psi and Lincoln recomends 33 psi.) I averaged 33 mpg on a 400 mile trip which included mountainous terrain. Very satisfied! The car handles very well and the 221 hp V6 has plenty of pep. As far as looks are concerned, I have gotten many compliments on the exterior and interior design from friends and strangers. During my trip I observed many cars giving the Zephyr a good look and a buddy of mine who has been a Cadillac man for years is trading in for a new Zephyr."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Dan Morrison, 06/23/2006,Great Car,5,A joy to ride with the 6 speed transmission and luxurious inner cabin.
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Collamore, 06/28/2006,Best Car,5,"We traded in our Lincoln Aviator for this car.  We wanted better gas mileage but didn't want to give up any luxury features that the Aviator had.  We didn't have to give up anything, as the Zephyr is loaded.  Classy. We don't feel we've given up any space by trading in our SUV with the large trunk and flip-down seats for more storage.  We opted for the navigation system... nice!  Didn't think we'd use it, but turns out it's a daily use tool.  We average 21 - 22 mpg, with a mix of in city and hwy miles. This is a car that feels sporty, classy, and will turn heads.  Fun to drive and easy controls where they should be placed."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,randysgram, 08/01/2006,"fun, fun, fun",4,"It handles well even on wet roads and has good visibility. My passengers and I love the smooth & quiet ride. I open the trunk, fold down the two back seats, lay a blanket down, and my dog rides to the vet in style. Took him a minute to figure out he had to enter from the trunk but he loves it now."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Bokar..., 08/09/2006,Much better than expected,4,Having driven only Town Cars and a LS for the past several years I find the Zephyr comparable to the LS and much  better in handling than the Town Cars. Pleasantly surprised at a much lower price.  Why the name change next year and additional HP I don't understand. Must be geared to a younger generation who don't remember the old classic Lincoln Zephyr
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Barry, 08/28/2006,"62 Car owned - ""this is very best""",5,"this is the quietest car with great ride. the thx radio is one the best made. after 500 miles we went on a trip and averaged 32.2 miles to the gallon. they talk about lack power, we were driving 65 and to pass a truck, we passed with ease, at 85 mph who needs more power at $3.00 per Gallon 'this a great car'"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,D. Taylor, 09/15/2006,"Wow, I love my new car!!!",5,"I just purchased my Zephyr. I can say that I am very happy with my new car. The interior is beautiful and roomy with many options at the base level. The engine is more powerful than I expected at 221 hp. The car feels a bit faster than 221 hp. People looking at the CTS, should take a look at the Zephyr before signing the check."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Robert Redeker, 09/23/2006,Fun to drive,5,"This is the finest car I have ever owned. I have owned the car for almost 2 months now and just love it. The performance from the motor and trans are execptional. The ride is awesome, tight but smooth and refined. Unbelievable all the looks you get on the road with this car. I'm not sure it's because people are trying to figure out what it is or because there really is not that many out there and they are curious. The cool factor is definitly a part of it I'm sure. The gas mileage is not bad on this car either. I have gotten consistently above 25 and in a recent mostly hwy trip received 29.6 mpg. That's not bad from the second tank of gas on the car. So far I have nothing but good to report."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Dareeka, 09/21/2006,One Great Lincoln,5,"This vehicle has been superb,have had it 6 months and it has been flawless. My previous 2 cars (Infiniti G35, Infiniti FX35) were complete junk compared to this car. Both were constantly in the shop with recalls, rattles and squeaks. This car has just been awesome, great stereo, seats and a great ride."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Anthony, 09/27/2006,Great Car,4,"I have had this since December 2005 and now have 28K miles.  Beautiful car, quiet, smooth.  Everyone who sees it comments, can't wait for my next one in 2008 when I pay this off!!!!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,John Hoie, 10/07/2006,Lincoln Zephyr,4,"The car drives smoothly, with good acceleration, medium suspension, little body lean. Steering is nicely weighted"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,bkegin, 10/13/2006,Traveler,4,"My work takes me on the road quite a bit and I like to have a vehicle that is reliable, fuel efficent and comfortable.  My Lincoln gives me all these plus it is sporty looking and fun to drive."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Chester A. Cosby, 10/12/2006,New Car,5,"I was really surprise how well this car drives and handles.  Ride is outstanding and get comments all the time on what a great looking car.  Lincoln has a winner here.  Zepyhr is a little odd name guess that is why they are changing it to MKT for 2007. I would recommend this car to anyone that wants looks, ride and features."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Mark Johnson, 11/06/2006,Love my 06 Zephyr,4,"Love my Zephyr !! It reminds me of my 73 Mustang in interior design only better. 6cyl. engine has plenty of power for me, but gas mileage could have been better. Exterior could have been more updated and a more sporty design than looking so ""Lincoln"". One year later no reported problems other that having the oil changed. Love the THX sound system, air con. seats, nice trunk,and like the retro dashboard.Had a Towncar previously and the Zephyr is much more fun to drive and a lot easier to park. "
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Evan, 11/28/2006,Great!,4,"Love this car!  I've been a Cadillac man and was looking to go with the CTS, but did a comparison on options, price, etc. and after driving the Zephyr, I was sold.  Roomier and more comfortable with better options for a little less moolah, and the cooled seats are great in a Texas summer!  I've not had any first year production issues either. Kudos to Lincoln."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,David, 12/05/2006,A Great Car To Have,5,"This is a great car, I got it at nero in Ohio, and there is nothing that I don't like about it. Buy it and you will love it!!! Everything is automatic, and done for you. This car is fully loaded, and in my case I would rate it #1 car!!!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,airone, 01/16/2007,Nice attempt.....falls short of imports,4,"All in all a good car.This car handles well in most situations and is quite comfortable overall.However,a little more headroom would be nice! Forget this car if you are 6'2 or over.The engine responds well at highway speeds when you are already going with the flow of traffic. This car needs more power off the line! As well as more insulation to keep some of that noise out of the cabin! Some of the interior finishes are a bit cheap and the leather could be a bit better grade. My driver seat is already showing signs of premature wear and the car is only 10 months old. I have to condtion it regularly!! Stereo and related electronics had to be replaced due to electronic failure. All under warranty.."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,anczdad, 03/09/2007,all american,4,"beautiful car,so much nicer than the cts,,,now thats an ugly car. why did they have to change the name to mkz,,now i have to trade mine in. i will miss my tungsten grey though since it isn't available on the mkz"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Michael, 03/02/2007,Bought this car used for my Mother,4,"Nice car.  Fuel mileage could be a bit better.  Very comfortable and quiet-- much quieter than the 1999 Chrysler 300M I owned.  Cooled seats are a welcome option!  My mother loves her ""new"" car.  Standard radio has much more clean and clear bass (and sounds better IMHO) than the fancy THX-II system."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Steve Provost, 08/18/2007,"So far, so good !",4," I purchased my '06 Zephyr 3 months ago with 26K miles. So far, I love it! I had intended to purchase a CTS, but when I saw the Lincoln, I realized it had everything I wanted. My car has the moonroof, THX stereo, cooled seats, and (I think)the optional headlights. I didn't realize a Zephyr even existed! Lincoln should have advertised more agressively! The 221 h.p. is less than my last vehicle ('oo supercharged Regal,240 h.p)yet I find the performance to be quite acceptable. I really like the smooth shifting 6 speed tranny. The car corners much better than my Buick (too much body roll) and has a quiet ride. Fuel mileage is between 23-28 mpg. Time will tell, but this car seems like a winner!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,BK1965, 10/05/2007,Great Domestic Luxury Sedan,4,"I previously owned a Cadillac Deville and was considering the CTS as a replacement. The Lincoln, with front- wheel drive, proved to have a more appealing interior design and layout and caused me to re-think my original plan. The Lincoln offers a stylish dash and cabin and sporty exterior looks. It is definitely not a Town Car and is a nice replacement for the Lincoln LS. The smooth 6-speed transmission provides a nice ride and good gas mileage. Lincoln has obviously gone back to the drawing board to try to attract a younger buyer and compete for some of the import shoppers in this segment."
lincoln,zephyr,2006,kb1, 05/10/2008,"Underrated, Undervalued",4,"What a deal. I can't think of anything else I could add to this car except a more powerful engine. It feels solid, people stop and look at it all the time. It drives well, has good pick up, corners well and all the instruments are laid out well. You can't read the computer in bright sun, but only at an angle. All in all a great buy!"
lincoln,zephyr,2006,Vic, 12/03/2019,Love my zephyr but...,4,"I love my 06 zephyr it's one classy looking car in black with the sharp chrome strips on the window sills. The sound system is incredible it's almost as  good as the Bose system I had in my 04 Cadillac DTS. Gas mileage isn't brutal but it isn't no 4 banger either. When it comes to the v6 3.0 DOHC that's where the issues are but there expected with the age of the vehicle now... got it 2 months ago and I have had to put valve cover gaskets and a oil pan gasket and a timing chain gasket on it to stop the leak and burning oil smell. Other then the aging motor issues I love my car to peace's. Just wish I had a aftermarket deck put in it so I could have Bluetooth and aux options... all in good time

plymouth,breeze,2000,Jim Rousch, 11/14/2008,500,5,"Who would believe me if I told you that a Plymouth Breeze could go 500 miles on a tank of gas? I've done it three times. The key is to drive the freeways as much as you can and keep it at 55-just like it's 1974 all over again. The car is comfortable and very reliable. The 2.4 liter engine has enough power to get you where you need to punch it, but still sips gas.  It's turning radius is insane! A Plymouth Breeze can do a straight U- turn in places where most cars its size can't."
plymouth,breeze,2000,sabz51, 08/21/2013,Very Dependable Daily Driver,4,"I have the 2000 Breeze with the 2.4L engine in it.
The car overall is very basic, but very practical.
The thing has never left me stranded and always starts right up, even in -30 below Wisconsin winters.
The car only has 88,000 miles on it, and is still running like its brand new.
It does have a very minor rust patch on the front of the hood, but other than that, everything is spot on."
plymouth,breeze,2000,very good buy, 11/18/2007,Great buy,5,"Just bought used with 156000 miles on it and this thing still thinks it's new. Great pick up, takes turns like my Camaro and dosen't use any gas. At over $3.40/gal for gas I plan on keeping it a very long time. The lie that only Honda and Toyota are reliable and dependable is crushed in my mind"
plymouth,breeze,2000,Peggy Setliff, 06/18/2008,I love this car,5,"I bought this car used, it was a leased car. I have had only a couple of problems with my car but they were minor. All of my grandchildren love to drive my car too. It handles so easy and has a lot of power. It has a lot of room to be a small car, very comfortable."
plymouth,breeze,2000,Carnation, 04/15/2002,Good Car,5,"This vehicle has been fun to drive and
very reliable"
plymouth,breeze,2000,SCSI4u2, 09/23/2002,"Enjoyable, Fun",4,"It was a fun car to drive, lasted over 
a year before an side impact crash 
totaled it. Baught as a used fleet car, 
had a few minor problems, but as it was 
still under warrenty they were fixed. 
Would recomend, it fit me well and i'm 
6'5""."
plymouth,breeze,2000,seilerr, 07/24/2003,Great Car,5,"Was not the car I wanted to buy, but was
what I could afford.  Bought 1 year old,
and had been a rental car.  Now that I
have it, the car is great.  No problems
at all even with the rental car history.
 I am glad I bought it."
plymouth,breeze,2000,LeslieS, 11/15/2003,Happy Camper,5,"It's very comfortable, with great pick 
up.  It is fun to drive and comfortably 
fits my four kids.  I'm happy with the 
features for a low price."
plymouth,breeze,2000,ctrower, 04/23/2004,great car,5,"this car has to be one of the greatest
car that plymout have made in year this
car handles like a dream and has
wonderful pick up speed it was a wise
move on my part to get this concerdering
what i paid for it!!!!!"
plymouth,breeze,2000,Carman444, 04/28/2008,1998 Plymouth Breeze,3,The car was an overall exeptional vehicle. I liked the roominess. It was a joy to drive and I loved it. (although the transmission came apart after the first two months)
plymouth,breeze,2000,Amanda, 12/10/2018,Riding the Breeze .....,5,"The Plymouth Breeze is excellent on gas mileage also very comfortable seats and a lot of room to be a smaller car. Very dependable car and not any extensive repairs just normal maintenance.The only gripe I have is the clear coat on the paint job is peeling off it must have been that year because I've seen others with the same problem.
"
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,Coda, 10/26/2009,Great Family Car,3,"The van has not been a problem. From my wife's point of view she has loved it. She likes the interior, very comfy and big. For tall people it is not a knee smasher or neck bender to get in. Very nice design. From a Mechanics point of view, it has been dependable. Transmission has held up, I change the trans fluid and filter every 40,000. The engine has no problems, change oil and run synthetic every 5,000. Braking is no problem for a van...this van is not a lamborgina, but if I wanted a lamb...then I would have bought it. The headlamps like all cars now are of plastic, keep them buffed or they dull the intesity of the headlights considerably. Do the maintenance,the van will take care you. "
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,Saviore, 11/07/2002,Suites my needs,3,"It rides well and it is roomy and 
comfortable, but I have a few caviats."
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,Sandy, 09/01/2006,We love it!,5,We have had our van for over six years and have had no problems with it.  It has been reliable in all weather conditions and comfortable for our teenagers while they were growing up.  All in all we love it.
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,biohazard8724, 05/03/2004,My mistake,2,"I never wanted to buy an American car 
but this one was in our price range.  
What a mistake!  Buy a Honda or Toyota."
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,Jason, 02/12/2005,"dependable, roomy family mover",4,"The 3.3l v6 is responsive, and gets pretty good mileage for a car this size. The seats are easily removed, if a little heavy once out, and comfortable. There is a lot of good in this car."
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,Jim, 12/10/2005,Good Vehicle,4,"We've had our Grand Voyager for over 5 years now.  It is our third one in a row, and we have had no problems with any of them.  We considered trading on an SUV, but based on mileage, seating capacity and utility a minivan still made more sense for us."
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,Mark Three Convers., 03/03/2005,Turtle Top Is Fine,4,"This Mark III model is loaded. The TV is great for grandkids.  6 disc CD is great for all.  The interior running lights add a nice touch.  Leather all around, second row removable seats ( 3rd bench also) is not unmanageable-even for grandad.  Never used the headset/radio that is for rear passengers only.  Vehicle now has 76,000 miles with no problems to date.  Front rotors are starting to pulsate, can't complain.  Highway mileage is a shade under 21 mpg, also pretty good.  Hauled a set of bunk beds 2 weeks ago.  "
plymouth,grand-voyager,2000,Caseybea, 05/03/2006,"Solid, quiet - but many mechanical issue",3,"I have owned since I got it new in 1999.   For those considering buying one used - I recommend caution.   Overall, the van is reasonably solid, and the seats are all heavy and mostly comfortable (way better than current stow-and-go).   Quality/reliability is a concern - the alignment went bad after about 80,000 miles and they've never been able to fix it right since.  Front suspension on driver side is rusting through the body.   Went through two transmissions.   A/C compressor blew at only 34000 miles.   Many other failures that have become expensive. If you can find one of these with low miles, it's a good van for long trips.   Highway mileage not terrible, but city mileage is low."
plymouth,neon,2000,Gary Bader, 06/28/2008,2000 Plymouth Neon,4,It is a great car. I had very little problems with it. I would buy another one. Great in the snow.
plymouth,neon,2000,MadScotsMan, 12/05/2008,It's a shame they stopped making these!,4,"This car was originally purchased for my wife in 2002. I have been driving it regularly since 2006. It has 122,000 miles on it it runs like a champ. No major issues at all. I drive about 50% dirt roads and it handles great in all road/weather conditions...particularly good in snow with good tires. I drive in some pretty awful conditions and am quite confident in the Neon. This has proven to be one of the most reliable, fun to drive and economical cars I've ever purchased.  The only problem I've had is leaky window and trunk seals. I look forward to many more enjoyable miles out of this fun and terribly underrated car. Excellent rally-cross capabilities!"
plymouth,neon,2000,JustinP, 11/01/2009,My First Car,3,"I bought this car for 1500 and despite having only one previous owner, this person didn't do ANY maintenance on the car, and left all of that up to the next owner, me. The front power windows haven't worked since the purchase. A/C went out after 1 year. Chipping paint is pretty common on the front bumper. The front passenger speaker blew around 80k mi, and the in-dash speaker on the same side went as well around 92k. I have all aftermarket speakers in the car now. I had problems with the alternator twice, but only had to replace it once. It is comfy however; lots of room for 5 passengers. The CD changer broke on me when I tried playing burnt CDs, which lead to the replacement of the stereo. "
plymouth,neon,2000,Jason, 06/02/2005,Look Elsewhere,2,"Did not have a great experience with this car. Build quality was horrible. The brake pads fell off locking the wheel on way to work. Also had the brakes not work at all (vacuum problem) and almost ended up in the Bay. Lots of rattles, bumper faded (seems to be a usual problem with red Neons). Car feels small, but did have a comfortable seat. With seats down, you could fit quite a bit of stuff. Had a 5 speed manual transmission (automatic was only 3 speed!) which was a bit clunky. The rubberized plastic parts were peeling before I bought it, and only got worse (even with my obsessive car detailing!). "
plymouth,neon,2000,cardawg4ever, 01/05/2004,My aching back!,3,"Ok, great gas mileage, excellent 
factory sound system! The drivers seat 
lumbar area is horrible. My back kills 
me after more than 15 minutes driving 
it. The breaks squeek constantly, and 
be prepared for major transmission 
work, or replacement. "
plymouth,neon,2000,sfox74, 01/10/2004,2000 Plymouth Neon Highline,4,"The 2000 Neon is a great economical 
car.  I have not had any problems with 
it other than the normal things that 
would need done to a car while owning 
it.  I would recommend this car to 
anyone look for something cheap to 
drive that looks pretty good too!  "
plymouth,neon,2000,GVLakerGuy, 04/19/2004,Runs like a champ,4,"I bought my 2000 Neon used with 42,000 
miles.  Since then I have driven 
12,000 miles and I have no 
complaints.  Its sometimes sluggish 
off the line, and a little noisy on 
the freeway.  It has great styling and 
an awesome factory sound system.  I 
also like all the options including a 
sunroof and disc changer.  No problems 
so far with regular maintainence.  
Only drawbacks are the lack of cruise 
control and the 3-speed transmission 
has no place in the 21st century."
plymouth,neon,2000,ecd2d, 05/07/2005,Great Car.,4,"I bought my Neon 4 years ago, for most of those years, I put 20,000+ miles plus per year, the car is now at 108,000, just had timing belt replaced, the car runs magically.  Compared to my husband's Honda, the Neon is doing better."
plymouth,neon,2000,elite_iv, 06/28/2003,Best for the MONEY!!,5,"Many people are of the opinion that 
Neons are junk, but I tell you I have 
had one for three years and have never 
had a problem with it.  They revamped 
the Neon in 2000 to make a statement in 
both styling and performance.  The car 
is solid handles well and is enjoyable 
to drive.  If you are looking for a 
sporty little 4 door with a nice 
factory sound system this is the car 
for you."
plymouth,neon,2000,Dink2008, 11/03/2008,Not the safest car,2,"I just received this car from my parents and I absolutely dislike it. When driving it, I can never feel comfortable because it does not feel like a safe car at all. The vehicle is thrown all over the road and has no power while going uphill. On the other hand the gas mileage is pretty fair, and the sound is alright. Over all I believe there are more downs than ups for this car and I would not recommend it if you are looking for a safe car. "
plymouth,neon,2000,Lmschwa, 06/30/2003,A great little car,4,"I drive a lot for my job, so I spend a 
lot of time in my car.  First of all, 
the gas mileage is great (27 mpg on 
average)!  Also, Neons are really 
inexpensive to begin with, so this is a 
very thrifty car.  Also, it is very 
visually appealing and doesn't 
look ""cheap.""  I love this car and hope 
to have it for many years to come!"
plymouth,neon,2000,HOLLIS, 06/07/2003,2000 PLYMOUTH NEON,5,"I LIKE THE PLYMOUTH NEON BETTER THAN 
THE DODGE. I HAVE OWNED BOTH. I NEVER 
HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY NEON.VERY 
RELIABLE.EXCELLENT ON GAS."
plymouth,neon,2000,MadScotsMan, 06/09/2008,Perfect $4.00 a Gallon Car,4,"We purchased the Neon in 2002 with 12,000 miles.  It now has 113,000 miles and contrary to what some might say, this has been a reliable, fun and economical car.  I still average over 30 mpg, my best being 39.9 on a long highway trip.  There have been no unusual repairs, just the normal repairs.  At 113k, I have finally replaced the springs, struts and stabilizer bars (went with SRT4 springs/bars/STS)and am in need of brakes.  That's it.  This is the fifth Neon in my family and I'd definitely buy another if they were still made. Great car, a blast to drive, good in snow and really reliable...and I am in no way easy on cars!  "
plymouth,neon,2000,Prescott White, 04/17/2002,good,4,"runs great interior great a little ding 
on the drivers back door other then 
that great low miles good on gas nice 
smooth ride"
plymouth,neon,2000,KTB, 01/03/2009,Great Car for Low Cost,4,"Good-looking, comfortable car with great gas mileage. Almost steered clear of buying a Neon, not sure why, but thought they had a junky reputation until I researched the vehicle and found the 2000 year and beyond to have great consumer satisfaction.  My daughter and I love this car for its price range. We have been very happy with ours."
plymouth,neon,2000,Neon LX, 05/15/2002,"Great Car, Great Price",4,"After driving this car for almost a 
year and a half now, I have nothing but 
praise for it.  It's spunky, the 
handling is great, and the interior is 
quite comfortable. To top it off, the 
factory sound system is marvelous.
Mechanically, the car has been 
excellent--no repairs have been needed.

Overall, this is a very tight & solid 
car.  I think anyone looking at 
smaller, more economical cars should do 
themselves a favor by checking out a 
Neon..."
plymouth,neon,2000,lmatracia, 11/09/2012,Loved my first car,4,"My dad got my first car, 2000 Plymouth Neon, with 44k for $3500 in 2010. The only major problem I ever encountered was the radiator went out at about 60k (which is VERY typical). I also had the tie rod end snap, but that was only because when the original owner replaced it they put the wrong part on. Overall I loved this car, i never worried about it breaking down and it got great mpg. Very reliable and worth the money. Unfortunately it was wrecked in the front end when someone hit me in a truck head on and drove off, i only had state minimum so was unable to fix the car. :( was very sad to see it go. I now drive a 2000 pt cruiser (which i also enjoy driving)"
plymouth,neon,2000,Traverse City, 01/15/2010,LOVE my car,5,"I purchased my neon brand new, and have yet to have anything mechanical go wrong.  Only normal upkeep on the usual things like breaks. I'm around 145,000 miles now and plan on driving it til it dies, which I'm sure won't be for another few years.  The only things that have gone wrong have all been electrical.  Motor burned out in the moon roof switch, 1 speaker has a vibration sound in it, and first cd changer didn't work but was replaced the first month of ownership and has worked fine ever since.  I would absolutely purchase another Plymouth and am sad that they are no longer made.  Also, my first car was a Plymouth, Reliant and was also a very reliable car."
plymouth,neon,2000,Crzy8, 06/11/2010,Best car I've ever owned,4,"Owned and driven for about 7 years; average daily commute of 70 miles. Purchased at 60,000 miles; now at 163,000 and going strong. It's had a chronic oil leak since around 90,000 - tried to have a couple different mechanics chase it down, but it's deep in the engine and repair estimate was more than half the $4,000 I paid for the car. But it runs fine and I don't mind a little incontinence. Otherwise, it handles nice, always starts, and has been extremely low maintenance. "
plymouth,neon,2000,smisley, 08/29/2010,I'll get another when she's gone,4,"209,000 miles. Never a prob. Its all about maintenence. I will def get another when it does kick it! Had a Ford contour for a yr and it had 7 recalls on it. Not secure in driving. Had this car 9 yrs. Give or take. Not one recall! "
plymouth,neon,2000,john w. lange, 09/01/2002,good car but not very big,5,"good car but being 6'2"" not big  for a 
man my size"
plymouth,neon,2000,pyro498, 11/25/2002,Neon # 2,3," This is my second Neon. The first was 
a 1995 that I purchased brand new. I 
was able to get the mileage up to 
189,000 before a dumb mistake roasted 
the engine. The 2000 Neon is styled 
nicely. The windows take getting used 
to. The interior is improved as is the 
space. The engine is a little easier 
to work on, except the jack point ins 
not really in a great area. Overall 
the Neon is a good starter car or just 
a runner."
plymouth,neon,2000,T FOSTER, 12/06/2002,GREAT CHOICE,4,"I THINK THE nEON IS GREAT, ITS STYLISH 
WITH THE BUBBLE EYES. THE GAS MILEAGE 
IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL, I MEAN $13.00 
TO FILL UP, EVEN WITH GAS PRICES BEING 
$1.40 PER GALLON. VERY VERY ECONOMICAL. 
IT IS COMFORTABLE, HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE 
TO LOAD KIDS OR HAVE A NEED TO HAUL 
THINGS, IT IS NOT MUCH SPACE. GREAT FOR 
TRAVELING IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PACK 
ALOT. THE SOUND SYSTEM IS GREAT. I HAVE 
NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS IN NEARLY 4 YEARS, 
ONLY REGULAR ROUTINE MAITENANCE AND 
THATS ONLY INCLUDED: OIL CHANGES, 
BRAKES, & TIRES. THAT'S IT!"
plymouth,neon,2000,vplsek, 02/19/2003,Reliable and great value,4,Very good reliable car.
plymouth,neon,2000,jmca1583, 08/13/2003,"it's all good, not great but good",3,"I heaerd all kinds of rumors that neons 
fell apart within a year after 
purchase, but I've had mine for 3 years 
without a single major problem. i've 
done really well with maintenance aside 
from a few late oil changes, and the 
car has held up really well. I'm up to 
96,000 miles on the thing (i drive 
EVERYWHERE) and it's been without a 
problem."
plymouth,neon,2000,nimnut, 07/21/2005,Great 1st car,3,"This was my first car and I bought it with 23,000 miles on it. I had to replace the clockswitch within a year, but that was due to a poor repair job the first time. No other major repairs in 4 years after driving about 500 miles back and forth from college to home 4 or 5 times a year. My only complaints: brakes squeak a lot when wet or if not used in a couple of days even when brand new. No trunk latch! It's horrible to have to turn off the car to open the trunk. Paint has been cracked and peeling on the bumper for about 2 years. There is some vibration and noise from the engine that started about a year after purchase. Fabulous, cheap, first car purchase. "
plymouth,neon,2000,ucf21, 04/28/2004,do not buy!!!!,3,"I bought my neon in Nov. '99.  It was 
great for the 1st 3 years except for 
the plastic molding on the driver side 
door cracked.  Then my warrany expired- 
my driver side door lock broke.  I took 
it in to the dealership and they 
replaced the door lock but since then 
all it does is lock and unlock itself 
numerous times- even when i drive.  I 
took it back it and they told me - very 
rudely that there was nothing wrong"
plymouth,neon,2000,shrtstuf1960, 10/13/2004,on the road again!,3,"I do love my 2000 Plymouth Neon.  I 
have had several problems with it 
though. Recall on brake boosters, 2 
years old and needed new motor mounts, 
also front struts at 2 years old, trunk 
flooded and needed re-adjusted and now 
at 4 years old, the A/C went out and 
needs a new evaporator core, drier, 
freon and expansion valve.  Very 
expensive up-keep. Also, my clear cote 
has bubbled and peeled and the door 
handles are falling apart. Car has a 
vibration. I have taken very good care 
of my car, oil changes, flushes ect. 
when time for.  I'm broke but still 
love my Neon!!"
plymouth,neon,2000,satifsfied neon owne, 10/15/2005,Pleased with my Neon,3,"I bought my 2000 Plymouth Neon in 2001 with 26,000 miles on it. It now has 113,000 miles! I am pleased with it, considering I only paid $8,500 for it in 2001. When I got it, I had three different people tell me that I made a mistake when I bought it, so I was scared. After 4.5 years, I am pleased. I had an oil leak and replaced a valve cover gasket, cam sensor, and rear seal. It fixed it. That cost around $350-$400 to fix. I have changed the brake pads, spark plugs/wires, air filters and oil changes. This is all I have done to car. Hopefully the car will last me another year or two."
plymouth,neon,2000,TomG, 01/28/2006,Fun to drive - 5 speed,4,"Bought this car for my wife when it was new in 2000. Except for the fact that since it was new, it has always seemed like it has an occasional engine misfire (the dealer replaced the spark plugs and wires under warranty), the car has been great and with over 92,000 miles, the only thing I have needed to do besides normal maintenance (oil changes, etc.) is replace the front brake pads which I did myself for about $25.  The best thing I did was to replace the OEM tires with some 195-60R15 Firestone Indy 500 tires.  What a difference that made in handling!  After the warranty expires, I've been using synthetic oil with 10 - 15000 miles between oil changes, but changing filters at 5,000 miles."
plymouth,neon,2000,Pete13, 07/18/2006,One of the Best! :),4,This is the second Neon I have owned and this is the even better that the first.  Very good reliability and spunky at the same time.  The body is well designed and it is very quiet and quick on the highways/interstate.  Would feel safe to drive anywhere.
plymouth,neon,2000,Will B., 07/25/2007,2000 NEON,4,"The only thing i dont like about this car is the power when driving uphill. the engin gets week, when its on low RPM's uphill! (rounds per mints...) it can do it pretty well when your on 4000 rpm's and higher. but  thats not an abuse to the motor, but it take lots of power from the engin. other than that its an exelent stock car for the money. Mine is the LX model with power front windows,locks,AC, and no hevy alloys wheels just hubcaps. Dont forget those NEON'S can be upgraged like crazy from proformance wise to looks and addons. :)"
plymouth,neon,2000,mk, 08/28/2007,Love it!,5,"I got my Neon used in 2004, and have put 80,000 miles on it for a total of 170,000.  I have hit large road debris twice,a huge deer carcass once and a tire carcass another time.  Aside from repairs to the radiator and bumper due to those incidents, I have had no repair needs outside of routine oil changes, new tires, balance and alignment. This car is inexpensive and gets great mileage and costs extremely little to maintain. The manual transmission makes it a fun little car to drive, and it does seat 4 comfortably, with a decent sized trunk.  I love this little car!"
plymouth,neon,2000,transmissiontrouble, 05/03/2003,Transmission Failure,4,"What a bummer, 41,000 miles and the 
transmission decided to stop working. 
The ten transmission shops I contacted 
were quick to explain that these 
transmissions are quite possibly the 
worst ever manufactured by any one 
company. The lowest quote I recieved 
for the rebuild was 2,300. Ok run the 
blue book on the car, or better yet 
contact some local dealers and have 
them tell you what its worth. Darn near 
nothing. Its to bad,I liked this car 
but will never purchase another 
Chrysler product again. Maybe I'll look 
at Hyundai, hey 10 100k powertrain 
warrranty, how could I go wrong?"
plymouth,neon,2000,Jason Medeiros, 05/07/2003,Wonderful Car,4,Buy this car no problems fubn to drive
plymouth,neon,2000,Satisfied In Salem, 05/29/2003,Love Our 2000 NEON,4,"We just purchased a 2000 Plymouth Neon,
and love it so far.  It is an automatic,
and while some reviews say the auto.
offers less power, we think it's quite
peppy.  We love the roominess of the
interior, and the sleek design of the
exterior.  I would recommend this car to
anyone looking to buy an economical and
reliable car."
plymouth,neon,2000,tinytike458, 03/12/2008,GREAT first car!,5,"I bought this car as a college commuter, and to drive home to work. It had 55,000 miles when bought, and 104,000 miles after it was totalled. I had normal upkeep with this car, never cause a major problem. The driver side door lock wouldn't work from the outside, and no trunk release was annoying. It handled great in the snow belt of Lake Erie, and great on gas. The trunk space was great especially for a constanly moving college student. The stereo system had a great sound. The motor was quiet and it accelerated well. I would reconmend this car to anyone!"
plymouth,neon,2000,javaman39, 07/02/2003,Love my NEON!!!,5,"I have had other ""same size/quality"" 
cars like my Neon before, but I have to 
admit that I got the most for my dollar 
with this purchase!
Great on Gas, Handles well on all 
roads, great interior as well as a 
sporty exterior makes this a fun car to 
drive, not to mention the fantastic 
audio system!"
plymouth,neon,2000,Str8ShootR, 03/30/2008,As much car as one person needs,4,"I commute 70 miles each day, and this car can make it through an entire week without a refill (auto trans). Bought in '04 at 60K miles; 120K thru '08. Accelerates well enough to get into the flow of traffic on short on-ramps. Decent steering response. The budget sound system has some kick, which is needed at speeds over 35 mph because the cab is quite noisy. CD player is moody with normal discs and dislikes CD- R/RW media. Heater can be a furnace on the coldest of Midwest winter days, but only when the engine is pulling the car at 45+ mph. Surprising roominess on the driver side can accomodate even a larger man, though at the expense of anyone unfortunate enough to be sitting in the back."
plymouth,neon,2000,mechcanix, 03/31/2008,Nice car,4,"Bought car used 8 years ago now have 180,000 mi. A bit noisy at highway speeds. Engine has rear main oil leak and sprak plug tubes leak oil but the car is very depenable always starts. I've taken it on long trips. Great mileage"
plymouth,neon,2000,Robert, 04/21/2008,Best car purchase I've made,4,"Bought new with 14 miles on it, 7 were my test drive, the other 7 were at the plant as it was a Quality Control test car.  I get 30 miles to the gallon, regularly driving 120 miles at 65 to 85 mph (60 miles one way to work).  My LX is the loaded version, Silver, 5spd man w/traction control and 4 wheel disc brakes, sun roof, premium sound w/4disc cd & cassette.  For the pounding this car has taken, I have more than gotten my $16,425 out of the car.  At 183000 miles I replaced the timing belt (before failure) even though rated at 100k miles, your milaege may vary & it is recommended to do at 100k because of the newer type engines easily damage when the belt goes."
plymouth,neon,2000,Debbie, 02/16/2018,I love it,5,"I bought my 2000 Neon in November of 1999. It is still going strong at 227,500 miles, most of which were Atlanta rush hour traffic  2 hours a day ! I prefer it over my husbands Lincoln except for on road trips.

plymouth,neon,2001,patrickl79, 08/22/2012,A little about my car and a comment on another post.,4,"I purchased my 2001 used from a private seller.
It had 120,000 miles and I only paid $500 for it.
It was non - running the problem turned out to be bad battery terminals a easy fix for about $4.
I love my car, its quick and sporty, handles well and seems to be well built and very reliable requiring only standard maintenance, something that most people simple forget or dont care to do. My only complaint is I wish the center console was bigger."
plymouth,neon,2001,jamesrizzuti, 10/26/2013,2001 Plymouth Neon A LOT OF LITTLE CAR,4,"The little Plymouth Neon is fun to drive, feels very solid on the road, and in general has a well designed interior.

For a compact car, it has remarkable interior room for 4 adults, and the back seats fold down to allow more truck originated space.

It's probably the best little car I've ever driven."
plymouth,neon,2001,Brown, 01/14/2009,Good Car,4,"I bought my 01 Neon a year and a half ago or so and I have loved it. My Neon was really basic, no power windows or other options but it was really reliable. I only replaced the battery and the tires on it so maintenance was low. I bought used but had regular service and it treated me well. A/C and heat worked perfectly. 2.0 liter gave it extra kick for a 4 cyl. Inside room was quite large for the size of the car, back seat spacious for compact car. I wrecked it and have to buy a new car but would get another Neon anytime."
plymouth,neon,2001,ehbowen, 02/08/2010,STILL a good car!,4,"I purchased my 2001 Neon new in November 2000 and kept it for more than eight years. It was the stickshift LX model, and I added a Chrysler-brand cruise control. Other than routine maintenance, the only service it needed was when the engine computer went into an error state. The car was still driveable and I drove it to the dealership, which repaired it under the emissions warranty even though the car had over 60000 miles on it at the time. The only negative I have to say about the car is that it's a little too low-slung; very easy to scrape the front end on sloped driveways. I sold the car to my 16-yr old niece last year, and she loves it-- it's STILL a good car!"

old car was a 99 Chervy prizm compared

good and was a great price.  I am 6""3'

into, and my shorter friends can drive 
it too.  The interior is very roomy."
plymouth,neon,2001,Tim Vondrak, 08/09/2003,Moderate,3,"It is a decent little car but it is 
small. It has good fuel economy and is a 
good car for running around in. The 
interior is a darker color that is 
eadier to hide dirt and is pretty 
comfortable. The trunk is a good size 
either if your working out of it or if 
you want to put a couple of subwoofers 
in the back. The driving isn't to rough

plymouth,neon,2001,crunkone, 03/08/2003,This car STINKS,3," My Neon is a very attractive, fun to 
drive car but it is too weak. And a 
compact car means nothing if you can't 
get good gas milage. And the car gives 
off a strong sulphuric smell that 
apparently no one can fix. Also it 
needs a 2-door model. A Civic is a 
better buy."
plymouth,neon,2001,saramoor, 06/07/2005,Great little car--surpasses reputation,4,"This is a great little car! I've had no problems with it (other than the typical brake pad change and new tires. I have 80,000 miles on it, so that's typical by this point. I  had a Honda Civic SI previous to my Neon and it was TERRIBLE. I know people love Honda's, but this Plymouth Neon has been GREAT! Much better, at least in my experience, than my Honda. It feels solid, is comfortable and I've had no problems. Nothing has ever broken or snapped off; it's really been great."

Side airbags, leather interior, the works. It really was a good value. We drive it daily from the Poconos to NYC. About 220 miles every day. I can't complain. "

car overall does exceptionaly well, 
has enough power. The sound system is 
magnificient, comes loaded with a 4 
disc in-dash changer and a 6 speaker 
system. It's very reliable and 
comfortable for heavy traveling. Fuel 
Economey is above average for a 2500 
lbs car that was fully loaded, but it 
could be better. A good idea would be 
to put 4 disc brakes with ABS. We 
would suggest it as a good 
starter car for anyone with a small 
family."

the best one so far, but the 2001 is 
close behind.  I have an automatic and 
wish I would have gotten a standard.  
The automatics are loud, but the car is 
still fun to drive.  Take a Neon for a 
drive you'll love it in the long run."
plymouth,neon,2001,whippingpostguy, 06/05/2003,Better car than 1st Gen Neon,5,"I have averaged 20,000 miles a year on 
a Neon since 1996.  The second 
generation, while a little heavier, is 
a much better car.  Excellent car to 
buy used, it's a better built car than 
it's reputation, and you can get a 
bargain price."

plymouth,prowler,2000,SuperNova, 11/05/2018,2000 Plymouth Prowler Pro's & Cons,3,"Great car, and a lot of fun to drive. handles very well, and turns a lot of heads. I wish they would have placed a larger engine in the vehicle, could use more HP, but that's me. It a hard car to get in and out of, and steering wheel is off set to left. Very limited room for your left leg, as it seems sandwiched between steering wheel & drivers door, due to the offset steering wheel. Overall, it is a very cool car, and fun to drive. Could have used a better stereo & more tech. Then again, this was built 18 years ago. I do see these cars holding, or increasing in value. Very cool car, that you don't see often, I do recommend the car, even with the items I mentioned.

Thumbs up and waves everytime I take it for a drive.
The sound that comes from this V6 is a bonus to. I was taken back how great my Prowler sounds when I accelerate!

plymouth,prowler,2001,Mark Hill, 04/06/2020,Awesome car,5,"   These cars get a bad rap by people that haven’t drove or owned one or know the real specs and reasons for the design . 
   They hold the road like a roadster should being they are the only factory hand built cor with equal weight on all four tires . As far as power goes the rating is 253 HP . It has a trans axle that gets more power to real wheels than any transmission. Making it feel like a 300 hp motor .  I have brought my prowler up to 143 on speedo with only mod being black cat exhaust that makes the car sound like a formula 1 Indy car . People that I have let drive it absolutely love it .
   Two drawbacks are the relentless attention you get while driving and the lack of a legit trunk but after all it’s just a toy that’s not meant to be your everyday grocery getter . "

The rest of the car is original, even the marker bulbs. One serpentine belt change, it's on its 3rd set of tires and brakes, which is all normal maintenance on any car along with oil and filter changes every 5000 miles. I'll probably swap out hoses, belts and fluids at 100k just as a matter of principle. Very comfortable and has been more reliable than my wife's Honda Accord. Now that the kids are gone, I'd like to get rid of it for something that gets better mileage, but I just can't justify it. "

One $80 dollar sensor and a $220 transmission leak. That's it other than stuff you would normally have to service. Not the most flashy vehicle but a solid value."

In these years, I have had transmission

 Have replaced the tyres once.  But
overall this has been a good buy.
Whoever owned it before me, put on
30,000 miles in 6 months!  Since then,
I've only added another 33,100! She's
been fair on fuel consumption (avg 17

Reliable, runs great. aside from tires and routine maintenance, one new starter and a seal leak that was an easy fix, GREAT family vehicle. Only complaint is the A/C has never been strong enough to keep the inside comfortable in the summer, have had it checked over and over, tweaks here and there, nothing has helped with that. In Arizona, that's pretty annoying."

When I initially purchased it in 2002, I had no idea they had such a penchant for going through transmissions.  Come to fine out, the have done this for over a decade, and Chrysler has done nothing to remedy the problem.  They keep selling a van to the public knowing the transmission will fail.  It's irresponsible and immoral.  I'm on my third transmission now with less than 100,000 miles.  For this reason alone, don't buy this van."

plymouth,voyager,2000,Constance Walsh, 01/09/2019,Honeymoon Review,4,"It's essential that the reader know this review is conditional, as I'm still on my 'new car' pink cloud, and other factors, such as:  I've owned this vehicle for all of three days; I'm a petite (110 lbs), female senior; no kids, no dogs, occasional passenger.  My needs are not typical. Writing for those with similar preferences.  I sought an older vehicle that could serve as a truck as well as personal transportation in relative comfort. A simple engine, with decent responsiveness - this one is perky. As few electronics as possible. Manual-operation windows - this was a must and hard to find. Relatively good on gas - it's a glorified V4. Compact (I do not like big) but roomy inside. Uncomplicated, easy to reach workings for radio, wipers, lights, air, windows, doors.  It fulfills all of these. Registration and insurance lower than shiny-new.  I am into older, sturdier, simpler things in life.  Didn't know vans came in ""petite"" and am thrilled by the dimensions of this Voyager - love the name, am a voyager myself. My new-old mini-van has 121K miles and it's red. The sun-burned white spots came off with sanding and polishing. I'll be taking out the two rows of back seats for space and weight considerations. I always start gently after a stop, and drive the speed limit.  It handles beautifully. I do not drive at night, so visibility through tinted windows not an issue. Someone commented on a bad blind-spot. I'll check that out more closely, it's important. Only one sliding side door, no problem. Love the big windows all around, this was a must, too. Front bucket seats are narrow, but for small-boned people like me it cradles comfortably. A tape deck!! Despite paint-burn this van has no dings and was well-maintained and clean inside, both engine and interior.  It has the versatility I wanted - easy parking, plenty of room for hauling even large items (I buy and sell antiques) and for dump-runs, and picking up wood for the stove.  All that's left to know is reliability and things breaking down. Time will tell. Got it for a great price from a friend.

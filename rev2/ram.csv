ram,1500,2011,mrish, 06/02/2014,75k and going,5,"I'm just now hitting 75k miles on my 11' Outdoorsman.
It has been completely reliable to date.
No issues to report at all.
the only thing I've done is change the oil, air filter, and plugs.
Which by the way, has to be changed every 30k miles and there are 16 of them.
I have a 30' travel trailer that weighs in at 6400# and it tows it great.
I use it as my daily driver and it is absolutely comfortable.
MPG is about 17, mostly interstate."
ram,1500,2011,Tom K, 10/09/2016,My experience is different than most,3,"I see a lot of very complimentary reviews on this truck.  But I've owned mine for over 4 years now and my experience has been and continues to be that, although the truck performs very well and still turns heads--including mine--with it's looks, there's been a litany of reliability problems that have changed my word-of-mouth recommendation from glowing to questioning and now I just tell people that it's been unreliable.  Let's review, shall we: rattle in the front door (can't find it, and I've taken that whole door apart), doormat light under the driver's side mirror flickers, vanity mirror lights not working (these last 2 are non-fused circuits, which means it's likely the general electronic module--read expensive), very annoying buzz in the stereo (try getting this troubleshot--impossible), dropped a lifter and the camshaft got chewed up (fixed under warranty, but still an internal engine failure at 58,000 miles), and now the power steering pump is going out.  What's next?  I had a Ford F150 for over ten years and didn't have a fraction of these problems.  Plus the 16 spark plugs need to be replaced every 30,000 miles.  ~$250 a service)  I really thought I'd keep this truck for 10 years or more.  But now I'm thinking ""pay it off and sell it"".  Update: back seat rattles if no
one is sitting in it and a new rattle in the center console.  Second Update: TPS Sensors have become a recurring problem.  Can't seem to go more than a couple months without and then another one drops out.

ram,1500,2011,Theresa Davies, 03/24/2016,will drive it till one of us concedes,5,"bought my 2011 truck new after my  beloved Tahoe got caught in a flood. I've driven the heck out of it.  Its a truck it's suppose to be driven hard.  I've got over 110k on it and I love it still. I love the looks I get when I pull up next to some business men and I  hop out in my suit, heels and briefcase in hand. It puts their overpriced family vehicles to shame. Only issue I've had is tow mirrors make a whine when your driving over 40 and the wind hits them just right. Just recently I noticed a small oil drop on the driver side front. Oil checks out, nothing loose so ?
Still driving my Ram and still love it!  I've got 150K and no issues at all with it.
I now have major issues with my Ram - it had intermitten starting issues.  Battery fine, Fuel pump fine, everything checked out but it would not start at times.  So I looked to see if anyone else was having issues.  It turns out it is the fuel pump relay.  A rather expensive repair.  Because I don't give up that easily I researched further and found that IF your ram has the tire pressure monitoring system and you by chance get a flat and are unable to get the flat fixed right away or end up having a tire that does not support the use of the tire pressure monitoring system you will eventually run into electrical problems for other parts of your vehicle.

ram,1500,2011,gianofan, 12/27/2014,"After 3 years, still a good truck, but a few flaws",4,"After 3 years of owning this truck and putting 44k miles on it, I thought I share a few thoughts.  First of all, this remains a very good truck overall and I'm still happy with it.  That said, I'm eyeing a new 2014 or 15 Longhorn and considering a trade.  This is primarily due to the new 8 gear transmission.  The 2011 had only the 5 gear, and there is a huge performance difference between them (which I realized after a test drive of a 2014 model recently).  There are also a number of other nice new features in the newer models...."
ram,1500,2011,cgt79, 10/04/2011,Excellent Truck!,4,"Purchased my 2011 Ram about a month ago, and I could not be happier.

The truck is very comfortable and rides very nice, for a truck.
The fit and finish is excellent, plenty of cubbyholes for storage and soft touch materials.
The center console with bucket seats is huge and offers two levels of storage

The 5.7L Hemi has plenty of power when needed and gets decent gas mileage for a full size truck (I am averaging 17.5 for mixed city/highway)
and the transmission is smooth and responsive.

Other than a minor issue with the brakes (sensor was mis-adjusted so the brake lights stayed on and cruise would not work) the build quality is very good."
ram,1500,2011,kmartin25404, 12/21/2010,I Love My New Ram!,4,"I purchased a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie.
I looked at Ford, Chevy, GM and Dodge prior to my purchase.
I have been very happy with my new truck.
I like the interior features and amenities.
The ride is very nice.
It has plenty of storage.
So far, I've been pleased with the fuel economy being a full size pickup.
The leather is elegant and plenty of leg room, even for it being a quad cab.
I highly recommend this truck."
ram,1500,2011,jarhead83, 09/04/2011,2011 dodge ram,4,I have had my truck for 3 months have about 4700 miles on it truck gets good mileage 16-21 5.7 hemi 4x2 slt bighorn but for the bad news the truck has been in the shop 4 times since I have had it 2 for the paint 2 for my power back glass leaking still do not know if it is fixed waiting a few days to wash again but know it will be going back as soon as the shop opens go in this morning it started and no gauges worked windshield wipers came on and would not cut off windows will not roll down radio will only cut off if you turn it off even with switch off so this will make 5 times in 3 months of which I owned the truck I like the look the power but man at the problems I'm having 
ram,1500,2011,bigmiles, 02/01/2013,Great to drive,4,"Purchased used June 2010, 34K miles, now have 68K. Con's: Have heard clicking/grinding noise under pedals when traction breaks. I suspect universal to transfer case, but dealer will verify. Other issue is the Uconnect / radio, cuts out, pops, this too will be dealt with at dealer. No cabin air filter for these trucks, guess that was a cost savings from manufacturer, I installed my own in 15 min. at a cost of $28.00 great investment. Glad I purchased the warranty. Pro's: Drove on vacation, I always use cruise, 19 MPG avg for trip of 2600 miles. "
ram,1500,2011,jfwill82, 02/25/2013,Engine Failure @ 16000,4,I purchased my ram new in july 2011. Up until recently it has been perfect. It has 16064 miles on it and the check engine light came on but i didnt notice any performance issues. I took it to the dealership to get scheduled in and they hooked it up to the computer and said it was only a missfire. I kept driving my truck and it only got worse. Loud knocking and backfiring and missing and valve noise. I took it back to the shop and they actually did a little bit of diagnostics on it and found the cylinder head had broke where the rocker shaft bolts to it. I have also had a grinding noise when losing traction when braking. 
ram,1500,2011,atraveler, 06/03/2012,"Most comfortable, economical truck ever",4,"I bought my truck used, with about 20k miles, I have driven it around 4 k with absolutely NO problems.
Driving the speed limit on the highway, using cruise, very little hard acceleration or braking, I am getting around 23 mpg.
I have owned 4 Dodges and several Fords and Chevys, and so far, this is the best.

I would recommend it to anyone."
ram,1500,2011,Don, 05/17/2016,"About 116,000 miles, still rolling",4,"At 75000 miles and 3 payments left on this truck,  I got a leak in the roof.  Auto repair facility says they fixed a leaky 3rd brake light at the top of rear window which is what it was.

No more problems with this truck.  Somewhere along the way, I had a brake job (I think around 80,000 miles (good brakes)) and replaced the battery around 90,000 miles.    On the negative side, my mileage has slipped from  and average of 18 to an average of  about 16.5 or so.  New plugs, filters etc didnt seems to help.  Realistically speaking, this may be a heavier foot.  This is a fabulous truck on the highway, love taking trips in it.

Exclt in comfort and looks.
All the boys drool over this one!"
ram,1500,2011,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,First Dodge,3,"My Ram is quieter and smoother driving then my previous('01,'03,'06)Sierra's. It has quite a few handy features that make it easier to use. I prefer the 4 doors w/Dodge then the suicide type w/GM. I am underwhelmed by the fuel economy because I am averaging 16mpg for the same exact roads/driving style I got 18mpg w/Sierra's(all non-mds V8's w/4sp autos and 4wd, Ram is V8w/mds w/5sp auto and 4wd). I was surprised to find out the 5.7L needs spark plug replacement (there are 16 of them!) every 2 years because they are standard plugs, not platinum tipped. In the service manual it recommends 89 octane w/5.7, that too was a surprise since all info I received before purchase mentions 87 octane."
ram,1500,2011,cyoung6, 08/30/2012,So far so good!,4,"This is my husband's truck but since I have driven it on numerous occasions, I thought I would write a review.
First of all, I am a petite woman (5ft) and this big truck is moderately comfortable for my small stature.
My husband is over 6ft tall and it suites him just fine, as well.
The truck is an animal in the snow with great traction control and handling.
We have 4 wheel drive and hemi option.
The mileage is great for a big truck with a big engine.
We average about 20mpg and the eco mode urges economical driving habits.
Love the dark green color we have."
ram,1500,2011,dvp16, 12/28/2011,ECO Mode is terrible but great ride.,3,"Great ride, smooth, quick.
Nice interior, better than Ford's.
The bad- the ECO mode or MDS that cuts the engine to four cylinders to save fuel is terrible.
Runs rough, sputters despite program flash from dealer. I had a 2011 Jeep with the same engine and the MDS switch was flawless.
So this must be a ""Ram"" problem. Check out some Ram forums and see the complaints about the ECO and MDS before purchasing. Drivers are placing the transmission in 5th gear to keep the MDS from engaging. I guess we know why Ram sales continue to fall.
Chrysler will not listen to the owners."
ram,1500,2011,jclaeys, 12/17/2011,Drive this truck thoroughly before purchasing,4,"Just traded in my 2011 Big Horn after ""reluctantly driving it"" for a mere 1500 miles.
 The new ""ECO"" technology is the most unrefined of any truck out there....where its' Hemi shuts down 4 cyl. to ""supposedly"" improve gas mileage. It is course sounding and causes a fair amount of ""vibration"" in the underpinnings of the truck, which makes the driving experience less than pleasant. GM has this technology down pat...never noticeable.
This truck is beautiful...but the gas mileage is pathetic at best....12mpg, and no, I don't have a lead foot. 
If you need a truck stay away from this one..the two most dreaded words you will ever hear..""it's normal"""
ram,1500,2011,olddirt, 04/12/2012,First vehicle I have had in years.,5,"I have just under 8k on the truck and runs great smooth and the econmy gets better daily.
It seems to get better milage above 65 mph than below. I have had no issues with the truck. I have asked for help with some of the options like phone link. but this is this the vehicle I've ever had it in. I have owned a number of other trucks from 1/2 ton to Mack dump trucks and cars from shelbys show qualty jeeps. and I was as happy as I am with this truck."

ram,1500,2011,PaulK, 12/08/2016,Great Truck! Hands down,4,"My first pickup and a great experience. I bought this one used with only 6K on the odometer. I was looking at Fords but the pricing was out of my reach. My friend has the Ford Platinum and headaches ever since he bought it used. I'm very happy with this truck. Haven't had any significant problems in almost 6 years and 100K miles of driving. Sometimes the remote door locks get finicky but every car has it's issues. I'll take that one. Great acceleration. Great looks with the center console and duel exhaust. The 5.7 Hemi sounds great starting up every morning. I wish the all manufacturers of pickups could put longer beds on them as standard equipment. Definitely needs backup assistance.

ram,1500,2011,Dave, 11/16/2010,2011 Dodge Larimie,4,"More decedent than any other vehicle I owned (have had several trucks, including 95 and 03 Dodge 2500 Diesels.)  My main interest was the ram box, which limited my choices - crew only.  From there I loaded it up cause I could.  (A heated steering wheel is over the top, but being storing over 4200 songs on the HD is cool, since I have almost that many.)  It fits a certain niche.  Ram box allows me to store everything I need to carry in the boxes, and keep the cab clean.  Managing about 16 mpg avg.  Love the sun roof.  Leather.  This is an old man's truck (which I am).  Better for towing (9500) than hauling (1200). Pretty and comfy - works for me.  Only 750 mi so far, no mechanical to report."
ram,1500,2011,mmacht, 06/03/2013,"Love it, Hate it",4,"The performance, comfort, and looks of the truck are amazing.
The coil springs and small bed limit real hauling if your truck is actually a truck.
Service departments are horrible.
A defective tire turned into a battle.
Since I bought it water has leaked into the cab and I'm being told that's normal.
Over 7 efforts have been made to repair it and I'm now filing a lemon claim on it.
Apparently, the water issue is a problem for Ram with people all over the internet trying to band-aid the issue.
My dealership has told me to stop washing my truck.
I'm not sure how they'll handle a response to the rain."
ram,1500,2011,sgilbert, 09/25/2011,I love my truck!,4,"My 2011 Dodge Quad Cab 4X4 has the Hemi.
I find the initial quality to be excellent.
No squeaks or rattles, and a beatiful, smooth quiet ride, almost like riding in a luxury car.
The seats are very comfortable and supportive (better than the Ford I also drove).

The hemi performs beautifully and I get about 13 mpg around town and cruising 60 -65, steady, produces around 20.
Everything works.
Haven't had it back to the dealer for anything, and I'm quite fussy.
The media center provides a ton of information I've never seen before in a vehicle, and the satellite radio is great (love that Sinatra channel).
Overall very pleased - I love to drive this truck!"
ram,1500,2011,Warner, 01/28/2016,Rust Never Sleeps,1,"I bought this truck and until now, I had been happy with my purchase. The left rear fender well is showing signs of rust bubbling through the paint. This sort of failure takes months to show itself. My truck ran out of rust-through warranty March of '15. This rust was discovered in December of '15 - a bubble the size of a pencil eraser. It had to have been in play back when I was still under warranty. I maintained this truck to a crazy level of detail. Washed and detailed no less than twice monthly. Still looks new. Except for the bubble on the fender.Called Chrysler, took to their local dealer for photos by the body shop, all their geniuses in Michigan looked at it and said no help with the repair. Hiding behind the warranty without any effort to retain goodwill with a 2-time Chrysler/Ram customer. Their caustic response has lit my fuse. No more Mopars for me, and I WILL dissuade anyone I can from buying Mopar. I am done with these losers. I'm sure Toyota will like my business.

ram,1500,2011,Pissed Off, 03/08/2016,DON'T BUY RAM TRUCKS!!!,1,"I had a new 2005. It's transmission went out at 81,000. Just out of warranty. I didn't want to pay the dealer 8000 for the repair so I made the mistake of trading it for a new 2011. Transmission went out at 4,000 miles. 1st trip to the dealer they said the transmission filter fell out internally. The next week I couldn't get it in drive. The next trip to the dealer they had to rebuild it. The sun roof started leaking after owning it for 2 years. Had it at the dealer multiple times and they couldn't fix it. The last time I called for an appointment they said they couldn't look at it because their rain machine was broken. I live in Tacoma Washington. Go figure it was raining that day. They aid they couldn't work on it in the rain. They have a lemon law in Washington state. Make sure to document and save paperwork for all repairs and file the docs through a lawyer. At 78,000 miles the right side exhaust manifold went out. There is a retrofit with grade eight bolts. They replaced the manifold under warranty but would not use the harder bolts-even if I paid for them. Now the other side is out. I guess it will be new exhaust manifolds every 60,000 to 80,000 miles. When it's on my nickel I will buy the better bolts and have them installed. I don't like drilling and having to extract broken studs. Other than the above mentioned problems this has been a very comfortable truck. It has plenty of power. I will not however buy anything Dodge, Chrysler or Ram again. I will buy a Chevy or GMC diesel with Allison tranny next time. Screw me once shame on you, screw me twice shame on me. I won't get screwed again. I must be a slow learner.

ram,1500,2011,tmusco265, 11/06/2011,No Regrets,5,"To be honest the Dodge Ram wasn't a consideration for me when I was looking at trucks.
My first choice was a 2011 Ford F150 FX4 with Ecoboost.
Although it was a very nice truck the cost was too high even with my dads Ford discount.
After seeing a friends Dodge I decided to check them out and boy am I glad I did!

The ride is so much smoother and responsive than I could've hoped for.
I love everything about the truck so far (7 weeks after buying).
The gas mileage of 21 hwy w/tonneau cover is amazing!
My last truck was a 06 Lincoln Mark LT and this trucks blows it away in EVERY category.

ram,1500,2011,Jay, 07/12/2019,"Looks Good, Drives Good, but Unreliable",1,"The vehicle looks great and rides great when it works.  The problem for my 2011 Dodge Ram Bighorn 5.7 Liter V8 addition has been reliability.  Perhaps, I just got one of those cars, but within 11,000 miles the transmission had to be replaced (I was not happy, but it was under warranty at least).  The FOB key system started clicking and ultimately had to be replaced to the tune of $1200.00 at about 40K miles (out of warranty of course).  The A/C compressor went out and had to be replaced at about 60K miles to the tune of another $1200.00.  Finally, at 74K miles the vehicle started to idle or run very rough at lower rpm's (under 1K).  My first thought spark plugs or coils, but apparently it is due to a broken bracket under the 5th Cylinder, cost to repair $5800.  There have been other issues here and there, faulty tire pressure system that has never worked, but in fairness, most of the other issues are fairly normal for an 8 year old vehicle.  It, also, seemed there was quite a few recalls for this vehicle as well, one was to fix the problem with getting the vehicle out of park (you had to use so much force to get the vehicle out of park, it felt like you were going to rip the gear shift off)(Dodge to their credit did fix the problem for free).  The vehicle has been regularly maintained pursuant to the maintenance schedule and has never been used to tow anything (do not even have a trailer hitch on it).  The vehicle is garaged parked at home and has covered parking at work.  I live in Florida, so the truck is not dealing with extreme winters, mountains or other unusual obstacles, just flat land driving.  At any rate, as good as the RAMS look and drive when they work, if you are looking for reliability, I regretfully can not recommend the truck.  A well maintained vehicle used lightly should be reliable for more than 75,000 miles.  So, unfortunately, the 2011 Dodge Ram will be my first and last Dodge/Ram product."

I have always loved the F-150 and was planning on buying one. 
Dodge won me over not only with their newer design on the Ram but also with their promises of renewed quality (backed by a pretty good warranty).

I didn't have any of the nice features I really wanted and being a new gen truck there were recalls to tweak this or fix that.
Now that the Ram has a few years under its belt, I can tell it is much more refined and composed.
I wanted chrome and 20"" rims, so I opted for the Longhorn.
I am extremely pleased with it.
It has the center console and back up camera that is more helpful than I would have thought.
I'm also very happy with the factory spray in bed liner."

I have had it back to the dealership three times and they tell me it is working as per spec, but also agree that the spec is inadequate.
FYI, the spec is to blow air at 20 degrees below the outside temperature.
 I can tell you that if the outside temperature hits 79 degrees or greater, you need to roll down the windows, or you will sweat in the car.
The dealership has tested my 2011 a/c performance against older models and they claim that the older models work better.
There is nothing that can be done about it.
It is a design flaw that ruins the truck."

Race Truck! If you like having plenty of power readily accessible you will be well pleased. I have installed an aftermarket intake on my Ram and imagine it has well over 400 horsepower. The ride and overall smoothness of the truck are incredible. People comment on how smooth it is. I would highly recommend the Ram to anyone.

Rides smoother than any truck I've owned, quick responsive steering with instruments easy to access and control. Uconnect is a nice feature also for hands free driving. Love my Ram! 
UPDATE 4/19/16: Have had some issues lately with my RAM. Two factory recalls related to malfunctioning airbags and steering issue. Shortly after the recall the truck was making a loud rattling noise on acceleration.  Turns out all the bolts on the exhaust manifold sheered off, another manufacturer defect but no recall issued as told to me by a Dealership mechanic. Truck still looks new and runs strong but had I known there were so many factory issues I'd have bought a newer year.

I am very light on the throttle and can get up to 18.2 driving to work everyday. That means letting the vehicle drop below 55 when going up hills to keep the ECO system engaged.

ram,1500,2012,Joe Bourgeois, 10/02/2017,RAM Costly to Keep,1,"Folks this my second RAM and I went all out when I bought this truck, did a spec and got everything I could wish for except navigation in the radio.  It's a RAM Bighorn, quad cab, 4x4, 5.7 hemi, cargo boxes, and loaded. I felt I had the best truck on the market better than Ford, Chevy, GMC, Toyota, and Nissan and had researched them all.  First issue was identified phones to work with truck Bluetooth radio didn't work well and most calls were dropped.  After much research learned best radio installed with an out of date android operating system with no way to update.  Also learned talking to RAM customer service a huge waste of time.  I paid the truck off this month and was planning to do scheduled maintenance at 120,000 and became an owner.  Same week check engine light came on put in trusted shop and had plugs (16 ), oil in front, rear, and transfer case changed, and belt.  Advised check engine light from shorted coil and had changed.  Planned to have radiator flushed and fluid changed.  A/C for two years has not cooled well and mechanics have been trying to find a leak, I live in hot South Louisiana, prior to flushing radiator had them find leak advised in evaporator coil requiring weeks and dash board to be pulled.  Also advised truck has a cracked exhaust manifold.  Driving home and discussing scheduling of new needed repairs with wife whose vehicle I borrowed for the days vehicle was in shop, check engine light back on.  Next week back in shop, no issue found advised if light comes back on bring to dealer, problem with computer.  Driving home check engine light back on and brought to another shop where at presently.  Advised cam shaft failure, no compression # 3 cylinder, may need new engine.  Later advised could fix, and having cam shaft, lifters, timing belt, changed.  Also having exhaust manifold, and evaporator core fixed and changed.  Hopefully I'll get the vehicle back sometime this month after approximately $6,000.00 of maintenance and repairs.  Note also two years into vehicle clothe seat bottom on drivers side failed $380.00 to replace, and three years into vehicle wheel tracking sensors failed.  Note mechanic has advised me he has three RAM's in his shop with same problems, and when in at dealer trying to get parts had two mechanics ahead of him trying to get same parts.  This truck was not cheap and I struggled to pay if off and now I will be struggling to just keep it rolling.  This truck has been very well maintained, all service done, and not driven hard.  RAM is aware of the short comings, issues with evaporator cores, cam shafts, lifters, tracking sensors, poor quality seat covers,  and exhaust manifold and for their benefits issues occur at 5 year, 100,000 miles at end of warranty.  Please note they report in their surveys of 95% of vehicles to 95,000 miles.  Costly to keep, costly to maintain, avoid RAM.  Follow Up note in resubmittal.  Since posting this review I'm getting nuisance warranty review calls from different numbers from all over the country. On average three per day.  I don't plan to buy another RAM product and gave them a chance first to deal with product short comings.  I strongly advise from my experience AVOID RAM.

ram,1500,2012,notafraid11, 08/15/2012,"Cross-Shopped with Ford, Loved the Ram",4,"After extensive shopping for a full-sized truck - mainly comparing it with the Ford F-150 XLT, I chose the Ram 1500 Crew Cab 4x4 Big Horn. It had the perfect mix of features I wanted (back-up camera, navigation) without having to have features I didn't necessarily want to pay for (leather, two-tone paint) that are available in the higher trim lines. Had to jump up to higher trim lines to get these features in the Ford. I also like the look of the Ram better than the Ford (as most seem to), and like its power delivery versus the Ford as well - EcoBoost in the Ford was not very smooth.

This is an excellent truck - very high quality, great power, and a great mix of useful mid-line features."
ram,1500,2012,JRD, 02/18/2018,2012 Dodge Ram Laramie,3,"After owning my 2012 Dodge Ram Laramie for about a year now, there are some awesome features about the vehicle that I love, along with some features about the vehicle that bother me. Starting with the list of items that i really like... 1.) I have the Dodge Ram Crew Cab Laramie 1500 with the black heated and cooled leather and the features available on this pickup are great. Heated and cooled seats work with no issues, living in Minnesota I will always have a heated steering wheel after this vehicle, and I will always have a upgraded sound system as the Alpine factory sound system sounds incredible. 2.) The power is fantastic for daily driving. I've driven this vehicle for about 20,000 miles now and I'm very impressed by smooth shifting along with easy passing power and towing power. The Hemi doesn't struggle to rip you back in your seat while doing it smoothly. 3.) The looks of this vehicle are great. I have the all white Laramie with 20"" chrome wheels. I get compliments consistently about the looks of the vehicle and it's almost 7 years old now! Here are a couple issues that bother me about the vehicle..... 1.) Within 2,500 miles of buying the vehicle, the hands free control module went out. What this meant for me is that I could no longer connect my phone via bluetooth for hands free calls or audio playback. I took it to the dealer to get a quote, and $100 later I was told the part cost $600 + labor to replace. Disappointing since I'm constantly on my phone. I'm sure i'll end up forking over the $1,000 dollar bill eventually to get this fixed. 2.) about 10,000 into driving the vehicle, my airbag light came on on my dash. After a little review, I read that this is a pretty serious issue since in the case of a collision, my airbags would not go off. After bringing it to the dealer, I found out the code was reset and the light is off. I'm a little uneasy whether or not the issue was actually fixed or not. 3.) Drive down a gravel road with this pickup... I can not believe the rock noise that is created during this experience. I have highway tires on my pickup and the rock noise is unacceptable. 4.) The winter MPG's is complete garbage. In my experience, I can not get better than 15 MPG combined during the winter while driving approximately 20/80 city/highway. 5.) The center console has a rattle which is easily fixed. It's still a little annoyance that could be avoided by Dodge. Overall, I  do like the pickup, power, and luxury interior of the 2012 Dodge Ram. With that being said, it won't be a bad day when I upgrade to a newer pickup...

Update 2/19/19
Ok.. I now have just under 100k miles on the Ram and I have had a new round of issues with it since my last review. The most concerning of these is that my transmission has went into “limp mode” 3 separate times with all three of them at highway speeds. What this means is that at 65-70 mph, the trans will suddenly downshift from 6 to 4. I’m being told it’s some sensor in the transmission, but without a transmission tear down, the exact issue is unknown. Rattles/squeaks: The center console rattles for no apparent reason with my temporary fix no longer working. The vents/fan squeak from time to time lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. MPG: I just had my spark plugs replaced hoping it would help my mileage out. I still barely get 15 on the highway driving conservatively. Combined mileage is more like 12-13 mpg. It’s getting old getting such poor mileage. The newer (15-18) Silverado’s with the 5.3L are averaging just under 20 combined which seems like a big upgrade. I think at this point I’m due for an upgrade and will be looking at a new/used Silverado.

So far there haven't been any serious issues, except for the sub par Nav system.  The truck is as solid as the day it rolled off the show room floor.  The paint and interior have held up great.  It pulls strong and rides smooth.  New tires at 50k miles improved the ride a lot.  So did a servicing at 50k miles to change some fluids, filters, and clean up a few things.  I drove it across the country from CA to FL and it hauled 600# of gear in the back no problem.  Just remember if you get the Hemi you will be buying 89+ octane fuel!  I got one, and I love mine.

Fantastic, smooth ride, and it responds almost effortlessly when you hit the accelerator.
As comfortable as most luxury cars.

Then I went to the ram, I put it half way down and layed a black strip down the road. The hemi definitely has a lot of power!
I also got the crew can because I have kids. The crew cab is super roomy with storage everywhere. I also got the dual exaust which is nice although I wish it was slightly louder I won't complain.  
Over all it's a great truck but there's one major thing I hate about dodges, which is rust, I noticed a quater inch rust spot that will be fixed immediately. 

Bought used with 28k on it.  Now have over 60k and have not had one issue.

ram,1500,2012,Will Newsome, 08/25/2016,Worked hard since it left the lot,5,"Just passed 132,000 miles on the odometer this morning. This is my company assigned truck that I travel all over the country in, designing and building RF networks. I sometimes ride in this truck for 14 hours straight and it is definitely the most comfortable truck I have ever driven. Power is good from the 5.7 and it has not had any leaks or failures. However, the transmission is starting to act ""funny"". It has a strange hesitation and jerking movement while idling up to a light or rolling through a parking lot. It has also had a few seriously hard shifts that felt like the trans was about to fall out the bottom of the truck. Still working fine otherwise and it doesn't do it all the time, but this transmission has been worked hard and has spent a lot of time pulling a trailer so it is starting to show signs of wear. My truck has the 6spd auto, the 8spd may be better/worse. Had to replace the struts about two years ago at the 90k mark, they were completely blown and the truck was bouncing around like a trampoline. Other than those issues the truck has given me no problems and I expect to keep driving it until 200k. My last work truck was a F150 and I will admit that it is built better than the Ram, it had fewer squeaks/creaks/rattles, but it didn't ride or look as good in my opinion.

*Update* Passed 185k miles and finally turned the truck back in. The company is liquidating it but it still runs and drives. Engine still purred but the trans is done. My new assigned truck is a 2018 F-150.

I contacted RAM headquarters about this issue, and they did nothing for me, saying my case and request were denied.

ram,1500,2012,George Bryant, 04/27/2017,My Ram Rocks!,5,"I purchased my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 in February of 2017 with 70000 miles on it. It is an ST trim level but it was optioned with the 5.7 Liter HEMI. This was not presented as an option for this review. I can only surmise that since my truck was an import from Canada at one point prior to my purchase, that perhaps the HEMI option on the ST is only available on units destined for Canada. Not sure. However, I love, love, love the HEMI! It has all the power of rabid wild tiger on steroids and cocaine, and it growls with an equivalent ferocity under hard acceleration. Even with the amazing amount of ample sound dampening material in this truck, you can still hear the roar of that V8, let me assure you. Yet despite it's raw power, under more muted driving, it is as civilized and tame as a small purring kitten. It has the civilized ride of a Cadillac too. Like I previously stated the sound dampening material must have been amply applied in this truck. On the freeway you can have a quiet conversation in a whisper, and you can hear it very clearly. Very little wind noise as well. The ride is smooth, with an amazing and uncanny ability to absorb potholes and other road bumps, in such a manner that it is barely a discernible bounce in the cabin. The materials in the cabin are plain, not a lot of glitzy finishes and the use of plastic is ample, but it doesn't bother me at all. Fuel economy is definitely a sore spot, I am averaging around 15 mile per gallon. I was hoping to get around 17 to 18 at least, but I do a lot of city driving, and the HEMI is too much fun to drive it in a more reasonable manner. If I was a little lighter on the accelerator, I am sure I could easily attain these averages. I really haven't had the chance to tow with it yet, but if my experience with the HEMI is any indication, I don't think any amount of moderate towing would be an issue. I have had a Ford in the past, and I have had a GMC as well. Neither hold a candle to the fun factor, practicality, or reliability I have experienced with this truck thus far. In fact my GMC was a money pit, I invested so much money in that truck that I do not think GM will find me as a return customer any time soon. My Ford was plain, and didn't wow or impress. Granted it was much older, but even with its age, I would have expected a little more refinement, albeit not to the extent my much newer Dodge Ram has. In short. I love this truck. I had an option of either the RAM or a Nissan Titan. Once I experienced the HEMI, the Dodge won hands down. Also, I am nostalgic. My grandfather had a really nice 1992 Dodge Ram with the Cummins Turbo Diesel. He bought it new. My father has also always been a Dodge fan. He had both a 1952 and a 1956 Dodge Truck. The latter was a custom built shop truck. I have fond memories of all of them. I love getting in my truck and even in 2012, they have that same Dodge emblem front and center on the dash. The font and format of that lettering has not changed in 60 years. I am proud to follow my father and my grandfather in purchasing a Dodge!

ram,1500,2012,lawman1967, 06/28/2012,More of a muscle car with a bed,4,"I went to my Ram dealer to buy a modern pickup truck, but came home with a 1960s muscle car instead.

This thing is very fast, handles well in normal driving, but is crude and ponderous on twisty roads, just like those muscle cars of the 1960s.
It even makes proper muscle car noises and wears one of the most famous muscle car badges.

Of course, it IS a modern pickup truck, with all of the payload, towing ability and that commanding driving position that trucks have always provided.
The quad cab actually has decent rear seat room, and all versions are very smooth and quiet on the highway.

Ford makes a better truck, but doesn't come close to the actual market price."

Without a doubt the most comfortable and well appointed vehicle I've ever owned.
Absolutely no issues that sometimes plague new cars.
Car like ride on the road, very quiet for a big truck, yet very capable off road.
The off road ride is head and shoulders above any other full size truck.
A bit on the expensive side for a truck but all vehicles seem to be excessively priced these days.

After 2.5 years and 35,000 mi., it still runs and feels like new. I've taken it cross-county on business with no problems.

ram,1500,2012,olyy, 05/04/2019,NO MORE HEMI'S !!!!,3,"This is a beautiful well designed truck except for the engine. A HEMI makes alot of power but also has a couple of serious  problems. First  problem is the exhaust manifold bolts that break off in the head. Once this happens you now have a constant tick. The right side exhaust manifold has been fixed twice, the left side once. The second and more serious problem are the lifters  they fail any time after 50,000 miles. When one fails you get  tick/rattle in the engine an has to be fixed, If you keep driving it will also ruin the camshaft causing complete engine failure, Very costly to fix this.

I am completely impressed with this truck. My last 3 cars a 2004 mustang gt, 2005 mustang gt and 2009 vw gti. in comparison this truck is FASTER than the 04 gt and the gti while getting similar mileage. mds works great, i would never notice the switch between 8 and 4 if not for the little eco light on the dash. the ride and handling are excellent as is the refinement. interior design is well thought out and materials are high quality nearly equal to the gti(they are known for interior quality) the sound system is amazing for a ""basic"" truck, good sound quality and volume, low distortion. there are lots of cubbies and storage areas that my last cars lacked. 7 cup holders up front! the styling is very aggressive and handsome. I have modified most of my past cars but i cant think of anything i would change. the 20"" wheels look great but may be hard to keep clean. I am blown away at the value of this truck. its amazing you can purchase this combination for such a low price. a few years ago a ford lighting offered similar performance, power to weight ratio for literally double the price or more, yet lacked the comfort and refinement available in this ram. if you haven't driven one GO NOW TO THE DEALER! every other truck on the market rides like a horse and carriage and none of them have the HEMI.

ram,1500,2012,rvaughnp1, 04/11/2012,Nice Truck pour gas mileage,4,"Really nice truck. For this model and price, i couldn't Ford or Chevy to come close as far as the amenities. I wish I had Ford Sync, and maybe some more gauges, i.e. oil, etc. I was not pleased with Chevy, unless you got into the higher lines (packages). 
The motor is so impressive. It is nothing to pass a vehicle on the highway. Watch the brakes on a 100 mph pass if you find yourself jumping back in between cars. I experienced a little swervy swervy in the front. 
The 4 wheel drive works great. The only issue I have noticed with the trans is that 1st gear extends a bit and releases abruptly. 
I have not realized any of the previous issues from the previous post except for the mileage."

Around 95,000 miles the transmission went out and I had two broken exhaust manifold bolts. All this was covered under warranty. Then one month later, now out of warranty, some sensor in the intake manifold caused my transmission to shift poorly. This cost me $400 at my local mechanic. Then both front wheel bearing went out. Bought them at Autozone but the threads on the stud were wrong. So I had to get them at Napa, another $500. Then at 123,xxx miles I start getting an engine error code so back to my mechanic. The one of the lifters failed and destroyed the camshaft, another $3000 repair. At the same time my mechanic told me I had a warped exhaust manifold ad that I had broken the same two bolts. So I contacted Chrysler about it. They refused to do anything. Basically, as much as I like this truck, and I gave it a decent review, I would NEVER buy another product from Chrysler...period!!! My wife has owned several Jeeps, all of them have given major trouble. Chrysler can no longer build a good product. If you are shopping for a Ram, quit. They're not worth the money.

No complaints.
I love it.
I owned a 2007 Chevy Silverado 1500 before this and I must admit there is no comparison.
The Ram is better in ride, comfort and in my opinion, performance.
I love the sound of the 5.7 Hemi (390 hp) engine.
Very aggressive.



The outside of the vehicle looks great as well.
I got the 20"" chrome wheels, dual rear exhaust with bright tips and I also added a tonneau hard cover for the bed.
Looks absolutely fantastic.
It's perfect for commuting to the office or hauling toys on the weekend.

Take one for a test drive.
You will not be disappointed."
ram,1500,2012,David Whipple I, 11/25/2018,Happy with the MPG and hauling,5,"Just got my 4.7 Ram about a month ago and I'm pleasantly surprised. For a large truck it averages alittle over 20mpg on the highway, and 17.5mgp in the city while handling like a car. I burn wood and purchase these large pallets full of wood that the seller says he has weighed at close to 600lbs each. I'm able to fit two into the bed of my truck and can notice only a slight drop to the truck. Driving with the load isn't bad either. With the 4.7L the truck acclerates smoothly with little to no lag with the load while hauling the wood up to my house in the mountains. The turning radius is great as well helping to navigate through traffic and parking lots. I had a smaller truck recently and this beast is definetly more nimble in tight spots. I would recommend the purchase as a 5 star and if it changes I'll update my review. I have ordered the K&N kit and will have it installed by next week which I'm anticipating better throttle response as well as some improvement to my mpg-we'll see how it goes.

ram,1500,2012,Dan, 05/23/2020,Excellent not perfect,3,"5.7 makes good power and is reliable. Got stuck driving an oil leak for 50 miles. Takes 7 quarts, drained only 2 when I could stop, motor still runs like a champ. The bad- premature rust spots here and there. I wash often, but my 07 Prius which I abuse never has rust but my babied truck does. The 6 speed auto is the same used in SUVs- it’s not overbuilt so be careful with HP mods. Had a transmission leak costing 1200 (at dealer) to fix just after warranty expired. Third brake light leaked into cabin. Fan setting switch died out. This generation needs spark plugs at 40k mile intervals, other vehicles have them at 100 or 150k. That said, love the look, drivability, 4WD on logging roads. Comfortable enough, sounds great even stock. Front end loader operator accidentally dumped 2800 lbs into the bed- although squatting, no damage to the suspension or tailgate, despite being loaded 2x as much as it’s 
rated for. 
Love- looks, value for money, Hemi, still cheaper maintenance than a luxury car.
Dislike- “Ram rust” despite care, transmission not robust or efficient for motor, little nuisances. 
2020- replaced passenger front wheel bearing. 85k miles. Still happy to drive the truck, it’s been great.

When I hit a bump doing 40km breaking the lower control arm at the ball joint. I had it towed to the dealership where it was purchase after they took pictures of the broken arm and the rest of the damage done to the truck emailing them of to a engineer. They called me back telling me that I must have be mudding and they will not cover the damage to the truck. At this point I am very upset with the way they have treated this situation and made up there own story of what happened.

I have a friend with a 2007 with 225,000 on his and and I don't see any reason not to do that with this one.... if I live that long.  Everything just works.  It all fits together like it was meant to be one whole vehicle and not a box of parts.  This thing is SOLID and really good looking too.  They can be had used for a good price.

ram,1500,2013,napiert@hotmail.com, 02/09/2016,Worth the wait!,5,"I did a very extensive review of Ford, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Ram, Chevy, and Cadillac when I was going to choose my retirement truck.  All of these trucks are great and you can't go wrong honestly with any of these amazing vehicles. For me, I'm a father of two (Boy 12, Daughter 10) and a husband. I worked for the military for 20 years and have always wanted a loaded truck for retirement with money not being an object...I still want a good deal though. I didn't need a 4X4 because I never needed it on my Ridgeline so I opted for the two wheel drive and comfort over off road duties.  

  So the Good: This 2013 Laramie is a looker! It just looks amazing with it's aggressive stance and chrome grill and trim. The quality is excellent both inside and out.  The leather seats are soft and VENTED and HEATED!!!! the stitching on the dash and seats just set it off. The interior is not a clone interior like the Mustang and the F-150 share just about identical interiors. POWER EVERYTHING! High tech LCD, customizable cluster with analog display as well that are integrated to the central display console in the dash.  The blue tooth works like a champ and it very easy and intuitive to use. Navigation is good, but it'll never replace your phone.  Plenty of charging docks and USB's for all your power needs and if you need it, you can make your truck a WI-FI hub. The sound system is amazing with clarity, volume, and bass! The ride is like floating and it is very easy to maneuver this beast, especially with the built in back up camera with guiding backup assist that is responsive to your steering inputs! Very cool. PLENTY of power! We towed a camper behind us with zero problems, it was like it wasn't even there. Exhaust sounds deep and strong and the acceleration gets you up to highway speeds and out of trouble FAST!!! The kids are comfortable in the back with plenty of leg room, and when the kids aren't there and you're grabbing groceries, the seats flip up with mini LEDs that light your rear cab located under the seats. Lots of hidden compartments in the front and the back to squirrel away bungie cords, first aid kits, tie down straps, jumper cables etc...  I get compliments from people all the time on this truck, she's a looker, has a great personality, strong, smart, and gets along with the family, all for a decent price! Seriously, the price/value is what won the Ram my 40 large for a used 2013 with 12,000 on it. With all the accessories and options, as well as the leather, 5.7 liter, AND a HUGE cab, the competition STILL wanted almost 50 Gs for a 2013 used model. Easily gets 18/20 MPG on the highway. Did I not mention that it looks amazing?!

  The Bad: The original tires that came from the dealer are garbage and wore VERY fast. I've already had to have the central LCD screen/computer completely replaced (I bought the extended warranty plan) and had to have a hose replaced to put out the check engine light. The cover for my tail hitch bolt cracked and came off making it look ugly (Petty, I know but the cover failed and cracked then fell off). The Fan for the A/C started to make a very LOUD noise while in use and that was replaced (under warranty). In the city it gets 14 MPG (It's a truck, I know, but these are real world stats here). It has a back up camera, but it really needs front sensors too...the hood is so high that I often misjudge how far away I am and have to check and re-park closer.

  Overall: As you can see, the good vastly outweighs the negative.  Ram nailed it and I see RAM trucks everywhere now. For me, the amount of Truck and FEATURES were the most important to me, given the price. Ram's value in the end won it my hard earned cash, I LOVE, that truck!

I checked out the Ford F150, The GMC, The Chevy Silverado, Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan.
Dodge was not even on my list.
After reviewing the trucks above I decided it was between GMC and Ford.
On the way home from test driving the Ford for a second time I pulled into the Dodge dealership and was introduced to the Dodge Ram 1500 Big Horn Quad Cab.
Even before I test drove it I was immediately impressed with the features and the overall impression that the trucks interior was much larger and wider than the other trucks.

I pulled over and popped the hood and found a rad hose not attached to engine. I called the dealership who sent a tech out to meet me (later found out that the hose is given a plastic peice at the factory to assit in assembly and it was never removed causing the hose to fall off under pressure). I spoke with the dealership and Chrysler Canada and was told too bad basically, your stuck with it. "
ram,1500,2013,lacoydr1, 05/22/2013,Love My Ram,5,"Last week I bought a Ram Express 1500 Crew Cab with the Hemi and 3.92 rear end.
It rides like a dream!
I only have 500 miles on it, but got 19.3 miles per gallon on a 150 mile round trip.
Average between city / highway is 17.4 mpg in the first week.
Not bad for a 395 hp V8.
I didn't try Ford because I just couldn't justify the price difference.
Already own one GM product and it has been in the shop more times than I care to mention.
Plus the V8 just doesn't have any balls compared to the Hemi.
I am hoping this truck will pull my 6000 TT with ease.
Already installed a BedRug and Access Tonneau cover.
Also hoping it is reliable.
But first week has been great.
Rock on Ram!

05/23/2016 -  Well, it's been 3 years now and I still love my Ram!  Mileage isn't quite as good since my kids have been driving it as I am sure they are opening up the Hemi.  But, towing my 6000 pound trailer has been awesome. My Ford E350 with the V10 would actually drop down to about 52 mph on a long hill and nearly overheat.  With the Ram I can accelerate up that same hill and hit 70!  Plus I get between 7.5 and 8 mpg vs. the 6.5 to 7 mpg I used to get with the Ford.  Truck still runs like a watch and hasn't needed anything but standard maintenance.  Plus it is worth way more than I owe on it.  Yippee.  I still highly recommend it.

11/28/2016 - Still loving the truck.  Did have to replace the tires at 35,000 miles, but wouldn't change a thing.  The van has still been problem free!  Still highly recommended.

05/28/2018 - 5 years and 54,000 miles with the truck and still loving it.  It has not been problem free, but it has not been a problem either.  Had to get both exhaust manifolds fixed as the bolts broke on both due to an expansion / contraction rate issue between the steel manifold and the aluminum engine block.  Both were covered under the 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.   Also, replaced the brakes around 50,000. Mileage isn't as great as it used to be either (I.e. 16-17) but overall, still love the truck and can't imagine parting with it.

I get 18mpg combined driving too! No Joke! Friend has ecoboost f150 and he can't get 18mpg and he doesn't have a hemi! "

ram,1500,2013,JP, 02/01/2017,No more lower back pain...,5,"I am 62 years old and I have always owned trucks.  Personal use only.  Trailering the boat.  Hunting.  Hauling stuff from the lumber yard.  Whatever.  Having owned just about every brand except for Nissan I can attest to one undeniable fact of life at this point in time.  My Ram 1500 4x4 Laramie Longhorn Crew Cab is the best Truck I have ever owned on so many levels.  I test drove every truck available in August of 2013 and my first impression always decided for me.  If the Driver's seat was unacceptable my lower back would start hurting almost immediately.  This is the ONLY Ram Truck that had proper lumbar support and comfort along with cooled and heated front seats that allowed me to drive longer than 5 minutes.  State of the Art Tech Package and I like the Ram Side Storage Bins a lot.  The 5.5' Bed is to short on several levels but they did not have any with the 6.5' Bed so...Mine had the Spray In Bed-liner.  However, with rain the bed does not drain so find an incline, point the nose uphill and drain the bed.  The Fuel Economy is exactly as labeled.  13 City and 17 Hwy.  However, If you can tolerate 60mph the 5.7 Hemi with Console Shift 6 speed AT will yield 20mpg all day long in NW Florida.  520Watt Alpine Stereo rocks the Cockpit with Pandora Radio from my iPhone via Bluetooth.  The U Connect Nav System is not perfect but fairly accurate given where I live and travel.  The female living in the Black Box (Ethel) is about the most cooperative woman I have ever asked to call someone.  Seriously friendly Bluetooth System with the Ram.  Had 4 Factory Recalls in 3 years of Lease and then bought out the Truck at the end of the lease with only 21,000 miles on the clock for $29,500.  KBB Excellent Condition Retail in August of 2016 was $40K.  Mine was $55,000 new and $44,000 after Rebates and Discounts.  Exact OEM Replacement in 2017 runs about $60K.  However, IF you drive more than I do I would seriously consider the 3.0 Italian Turbo Diesel.  A friend of mine has one in his 2014 Longhorn and claims  30mpg everywhere with the mandatory 8 speed AT.  No other maintenance issues per se since new.  Annual Oil Changes and Rotate the Tires every 10,000 miles.  My OEM H7/94R Battery will get replaced at about the 4 year mark.  Wiper Blades every year.  Remove the Antenna and tuck in the mirrors for monthly car washes.  I crawled under the truck the other day to just have a look and no rust per se anywhere.  But seriously, a $4,000 Depreciation over 3 years and 21K Miles in an American Made Half Ton 4x4?  Never would have guessed that in a million years.  These Trucks have won multiple awards for reliability and longest lasting but that matters little to me if my lower back isn't comfortable for any distance I need to travel.  I sincerely hope this will be the last truck I ever own in my lifetime.  And, IF I never, ever, ever have to deal with Chrysler Capital again I will die with a smile on my face.  JP

ram,1500,2013,Dave B., 09/14/2018,If you don't mind a glitchy electrical system...,4,"My truck is acutally a SLT Big Horn V8, but that option isn't listed.  Truck rides nice, looks awesome, carries a lot and has acceleration out the wahzoo. I read all the reviews on these trucks, saw the problems listed for the 2013's & 2014's on websites (like Car complaints).  I have owned Ram in the past and really liked them, so I took a chance on this one.  But I bought an extended warranty with it (something I never do).  Good thing I did, has already paid for itself.   And I'm sure it'll pay for itself again.  Had it about 4 months and the center info display (behind the steering wheel), blanked out.   It was about 14 degrees out, but as soon as the truck warmed up it came on again.  Everyday the temp went below 20, the center display would go out.  The radio works fine, that screen didn't go out.  But these years are notorious for problems with electrical (mainly the TIPM which controls everything).  Both of my front struts were leaking, but that's not bad for a 5yr old truck w/85k miles.  Warranty paid to replace them.  Warranty also covered the exhaust manifold when it developed a leak.  Again, expected on a truck this old.   I would buy it again, but def with and extended warranty.

Truck is a 2013 and has had no problems what-so-ever.  Truck was built very well with no rattles.  You'll love the Ram and I've heard that the new ones have much more features than mine has.

ram,1500,2013,TSB8C, 12/18/2016,Totally Unreliable,2,"Owned for just over 2 years so far - alignment bad right off dealer lot (never even got home the first day owned), driver visor drops down even after replacement, broken panel on console from factory, console lid won't latch down, rear passenger window won't roll up, start/stop button stuck and left me stranded, clanking noise in front end - stripped gears in rack&pinion assembly, poor paint resulting in rust at body seams in wheel wells, radio drifts frequencies on hot days, leaking rear pinion seal, mileage has dropped about 20% after first 12 months, multiple software updates required in short time I've had it. Great mileage at first, now dropped off, quite comfortable, but weak and sagging rear suspension under moderate load. Dealer refuses to fix all the issues. Dodge refused buy-back under lemon arbitration. Won't stand behind warranty, which of course has now expired.

ram,1500,2013,Lyle, 10/25/2017,Worst vehicle I’ve ever owned,1,"I come from a family that has owned nothing but dodge trucks for the last 40+ years. The truck looks great, and interior is nice. That’s about all I have good to say about it. Now for the bad parts. I preformed all the required maintenance at the intervals the truck required and can’t keep it on the road. At around 50k miles the engine started tapping. I took it in and found out the cam shaft was ruined and lifters were ground off. After 2 months of the dealer having it I get it back (with the gas light on) and the following week the transmission locks into 4th gear. I take it back and after 5 weeks get it back everything seems fine. 3 months later the engine tapping cane back along with transmission issues. This happened a total of 5 times for the engine. THE SAME EXACT PARTS CONTINUING TO FAIL! During this time I contacted Chrysler to see if we can find out what is causing this to happen on both the transmission and the lifters grinding down, I was told that “engineers would look at it and figure it out.” After I get the truck back I had no response from Chrysler. I called and emailed and received no response. So basically I’m stuck with a truck that constantly needs rebuilding of the drivetrain. With Zero help from anyone. In the last 2 years I’ve owned he truck, the dealer has had it a  total of 10 months. Half the time I didn’t receive a loaner like the warranty said I should. This is by far the worst experience I’ve had with a vehicle that is supposed to be “ram tough” this is the last dodge I will ever own and warn everyone I can to stay away from this company and their products. 5 engine rebuilds and 5 transmission rebuilds in less than 100k miles is absolutely ridiculous. Buy a ford or Chevy

ram,1500,2013,qaz2, 01/21/2014,New Truck Just Quit,4,"We bought the RAM 1500 in Feb 2013.
It ran great for 9000 miles, averaging 22 mpg city/25 mpg highway.
On a trip to the Florida Keys, the ""check engine"" symbol was displayed
flashing and the truck automatically shut down while we were traveling at 60 mph on a busy highway.
VERY unsafe condition. We finally were towed to a dealership.
They replaced an ignition coil.
Five miles later it happened again.
Had to get towed once again.
Dealership found that it was a short in the wiring bundle.
Problem finally fixed.
Overall cost to us - $400 (rental cars, hotels, etc.).
Called RAM to see if they would provide some compensation, and they said sorry about that.
Nice support there."
ram,1500,2013,zaretroc, 02/09/2014,Best truck for the money,5,"This review is based on a comparison with my last truck which was an 2014 F150 XLT Supercab with the 3.7L V6 which I sold to purchase the new Ram 2016 regular cab. I purchased this new model in 6/2016. This truck has the 3.7 6 cylinder mated to to Rams 8 speed automatic with active grill shutters which automatically close at highway speeds for economy. Its rated at 17 city, and 25 hwy. I have never gotten less than 20mpg in the city!
The ride is smooth and comfortable, the engine is quiet and in my humble opinion, the design beats the domestic rivals hands down in looks and driveability.
I got my Tradesman with power windows, locks, satellite radio, cruise, remote tail gate locking, which the Ford did not have, tow package, bedliner etc for about 25k with rebates. Guys you won't find a nicer better looking, and driving truck for this amount. I give it 5 stars. Plus free 5yr roadside assistance and 100k power train warranty

ram,1500,2013,roger126, 08/30/2013,Unimpressed,3,"Can't believe that this is the truck of the year!
Have about 2000 miles on it and have scheduled second trip to dealer to try to fix the radio.
The touch screen goes black and I can't control the radio.
I also have had on several occasions where when I turn the key nothing happens.
If I take the key out and try again, then it will start.
Not very comfortable feeling if I want to take it out into the woods.
I will give it credit for fuel economy with the 6 cyl and 8 speed transmission.
Not sure if I like the dial shifter.
In light of the other electronic issues I am not confident that will not become an issue down the road.
The ride is good, the paint was not the best quality"
ram,1500,2013,Fred P., 11/16/2018,Lowered 2013 Ram R/T gets looks and is quick,5,"The ""R/T"" model is actually a Sport. Dealerships may very well have no idea what a Ram R/T is. I bought my 2013 Ram R/T used in 2016; the previous owner installed a Belltech aftermarket 2/4 lowering kit. Rear end of these trucks tends to sway at 40+ mph when lowered and riding on bad shocks. I swapped out to beefier shocks and truck rides great now. Recently, I've installed ARH long tube headers and a custom tune which dramatically ""wakes up"" the 5.7L Hemi in this truck. The 6 speed trans has a poor reputation but mine has been good so far... shifts a lil slow for my tastes. If looking for a Ram R/T, get the 8 speed if possible as they have a fantastic reputation. Other than knowing my 6 speed trans might fail at some point, I love my truck. Comfortable and powerful. Remote start on cold days with seat and steering wheel warmers is soo nice.  Ram boxes are very handy to have on a single cab if you know you'll never use a bed canopy. Note that my MPG in this review reflects a custom tune, headers, and 92 octane fuel. When stock, this truck ran on 89 octane and was getting about 17 mpg in mixed traffic. The engines MDS (a cylinder deactivation technology) does help with improving mileage.

ram,1500,2013,ishepperd, 04/01/2013,Best looking pickup out there (IMHO),4,"I'm not a pickup guy but they've gotten so much nicer over the last 10 years that I reconsidered. I'm also a Ford guy and swore I'd never by a Chrysler product. But the Ram 1500 has great styling and features across the whole line. The Longhorn is just nicer looking than the tip-top F150 Limited. Head-turning styling with rugged good looks outside, and a luxury car interior."
ram,1500,2013,tyler_lopes, 07/23/2013,Awesome experience!!,4,If you want a truck this is the truck to get! First off what's better than a hemi?! This is most fun I've ever had driving a vehicle in my life and I've also owned a charger. It's definitely a truck that I would buy more than once and I could drive it for years.
ram,1500,2013,Fred, 06/21/2018,Can't get out of its way,3,"The v6 may be ok in town but not for highway use.  Even the slightest hill and it loses speed. The cruise control can't keep up with traffic on the highway.  This thing needs a turbo. It is one thing to have a truck that can't tow anything and we knew that. We have a real truck for towing (96 2500 Ram) but it should be able to keep its speed up.   The seating position is also very low.  I am 5'9"" and I can't see the front corners. When you back up to a dock by yourself it is pure guess work.  Really liked the older trucks where you could see out.  Check engine light came on the second day and repeatedly since then. It wasn't a big deal with the dealership and they didn't want to work on it until the warranty expired and then they wanted to fix it.  With the way the dealership worked us on this truck and the service department, this will probably be the last dodge or ram for us.  We have been driving them since we bought the 96 and have had several different ones.

ram,1500,2013,Dustin, 06/15/2019,Love the 2013 Ram but.....,4,"I bought a 2013 Ram Laramie 1500 a couple years ago.  Here’s my thoughts: this truck handles well, accelerates well and is more comfortable than my 2008 Sierra.  It has all of the tech features for the time and the air ride suspension.  That suspension is a blessing and a curse.  The truck rides very smoothly and quietly and I attribute that to the air suspension.  We had a week of very cold weather this last year in Seattle and the truck decided to bottom out to the bump stops and become useless due to the air suspension .  This rectifies itself once the weather warms up and the truck will raise itself to a normal driving position.  Also, do not try to use the key fob to set the truck to entry exit mode and leave it sitting overnight.  The compressor won’t stop running and you’ll wake up to a dead battery. This has happened multiple times.  Battery checks out as fully charged but the truck is dead.  Not cool.  Not ideal when you have to be to work early.  MPGs in town have not broken 10ish.  It’s a gas hog.  On a 3+ hour cross state trip I did get it to 24 mpg.  I have projector headlights and replaced with aftermarket HID lights as the stock ones were very weak. The interior LED map lights flicker horribly and need replacing.  If you want a RAM of this era, stay away from the air suspension in cold climates and be ready for odd electrical gremlins.  I miss my Mercedes Benz GLK.  That thing was flawless.

ram,1500,2014,Chris, 12/22/2015,"Great Truck for ""Harry Homeowner""",5,"I don't tow or haul things, but I wanted a truck. I own a home and end up transporting things weekly and this Ram works great. One thing I was always baffled by were the tie downs on my Silverado - they weren't cut out of the bed liner. This Ram came with 4 tie downs (2 in the nose of the bed and 2 in the tail) which makes for moving almost any household item or piece of equipment a breeze. This truck has all the get up and go I ever needed while all the while is great on gas. Currently, I'm right at 20 mpg which is awesome compared to my 2009 Silverado which was hovering around 15/16 mpg. The 3.6L V6 is everything most truck owners need and then some, but still they feel the need to spend the extra money on the 5.7L V8. Don't get me wrong, they sound great and really get going - they can also haul and tow well - but for someone with a family, who wants a 4WD truck to help with odd jobs and for transporting bigger items, this truck is a great option. Crew Cab a must IMO. The Ram has a MASSIVE cabin which is great for when all my friends are riding with me or when my wife and the dogs all pile in.

ram,1500,2014,Mark, 09/12/2015,Second Ram 1500 ... very pleased with the brand!,4,"This is my second Ram 1500, first was a 2003 Quad Cab 4x4 with a 5.7 Hemi and a 6'4"" bed.  It served me well enough that I went back to Ram when I purchased my 2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab 4x4 with a 5.7 Hemi and a 5'7"" bed.  The '03 had he Off Road package, the '14 has the Outdoorsman package.  I mention this because unless you have a true need to go off road, you really do not want an Outdoorsman.  It is the most stiffly sprung 1500 in the Ram line.  It also comes standard with 10 ply tires versus the normal 4 ply tires.  Together these two things make you painfully aware of every pothole in the road!  past that the truck is FANTASTIC!

My truck has the 8 speed transmission with 3.91 read end (standard on the Outdoorsman) and with the 390 horse Hemi it will flat out move when you need it to move.  The surprising thing is that I am averaging 17.5 mpg and on a recent road trip from Topeka, KS to Madison, WI the truck averaged 18.5 for 1198 miles.  WOW ... in a 4x4 ... my best friends F-250 Super Duty 4x4 diesel doesn't do any better and I didn't pop $4500 for a diesel option like he did!  I am now at 27,000 miles and still love my Ram.  I change the oil, put gas in it, and goes and goes and goes, and looks good doing it.  Would I recommend a Ram to a friend or family member, after eleven years and several hundred thousand miles ... Absolutely I would!

Update March 2016:  next month I will have owned my Ram for two years and I am now at 35,000 miles.  After going through my second winter my overall mileage has dropped from 17.5 to 16.8 ... early morning warm-ups I guess.  Last fall I added a topper and a full BedRug turning the back of the pickup into he biggest trunk I've ever seen!  Do I still love the truck?  That would be a yes and no.  I still love the truck, but it was way overkill for me.  The Outdoorsman is the most off road ready pickup in the 1500 line.  As such it is more stiffly sprung and comes standard with 10 ply tires.  If you hunt, fish, need to go off road to get to that special spot, this is your truck.  If like me you spend 95% of your time on streets and highways you would be better served with a Big Horn or Sport model.

ram,1500,2014,cpercha, 06/15/2014,Beats my F-150 Ecoboost any day of the week!,5,"Wow!!! After 3 years and 88,000 miles in a 2011 Ford F-150 Ecoboost I can tell you that the Ram makes it look like a glorified golf cart. I had driven several Rams before making my choice on which one to get. I ended up going with the Hemi attached to the 8 speed automatic and 3.92 gears. At first I was concerned that I would pay the price at the pump for the 3.92 gearing but I have found that this has not been the case at all. When driving models with 3.21 gears I had to get into the gas more to get the response I was looking for. With the 3.92 not only am I getting better performance but I don't need to hit the peddle much to get it to move which ended up resulting in better gas mileage. "

ram,1500,2014,Steve Breithaupt, 08/21/2016,RAM 2014 ECODiesel Pickup Longhorn Version in 4WD,2,"I love this truck but I am going to sell it.  It has the new diesel arrangement with the diesel exhaust fluid.  I have a '97 RAM 2500 Cummins engine that has 140,000 miles on it and runs like a top.  Never let me down.  That can not be said of the new truck.  First problem was the exhaust filter regeneration.  My kids were driving it back and forth to our house from the farm and they got a message saying ""exhaust filter regeneration required drive at highway speeds"".  They did not know that meant drop your plans for the next 30 minutes and take a drive.  Finally it went into ""Limp Mode"", which should be illegal as it limits speed to 35MPH.  My wife and I nearly got killed trying to drive it to a dealer 45 miles away for a forced regeneration.  We stopped and had it towed.  Latest problem is DEF tank gauge quit working at about 47,000 miles which also gives you a CEL.  I can still drive it but have to overflow the DEF tank to keep it filled.  Problem appears to be widespread and occurs around 45K miles.  Whole tank assembly has to be replaced at about $3,000 ($2,100 for part alone).  Bigger problem is there are no parts and no ETA for parts.  Even if I get a part I won't trust it.  New Diesel/DEF is not ready for prime time in my opinion.  I would not recommend this truck for city driving especially in heavy traffic.  If you are stuck in a massive traffic jam and it suddenly decides to regenerate it's exhaust filter you have a real problem.  No one seems to know if a new tank will solve the current problem or just kick the can down the road another 45K miles.   I understand from checking around that all of the new diesel pickups do the ""Limp"" mode thing.    There are several things that can cause that and another condition that does a countdown to truck won't start.  If you want to buy a new diesel I suggest that you read the owners manual carefully before you buy it and ponder driving to your dealer at 35MPH.  I am going to buy a gas burner."
ram,1500,2014,Josh Carrier, 04/01/2016,great truck with a few twists,3,"I like the truck  BUT it has has some problems. I bought this truck new in December 2014 and got a great deal on it. Several months after i had it, the check engine light came on. The grill shutter had broke and needed replaced. About six months after that, the truck started making a squealing noise when i started it in the cold. The dealership said the idler pully was bad and needed replaced. As of yesterday (3/31/2016) the truck had 24,5xx miles on it and the check engine came on AGAIN. The dealership said the oil pressure senser was bad and needed replaced. I really like the truck. Its fun to drive, gets good gas millage, and it looks sharp but, these problems are getting annoying. Its still a fairly new truck. Ive never heard of anyone having problems so soon.

UPDATE: 8/02/2018
 The truck had 33,000 miles on. The check engine light came on and I took it to the dealership. The technician ran  the code  said it was the antifreeze by- pass valve that was bad. I asked him what that was and he said he did not know. I took it to a Chevrolet dealership and traded it in for a 2016 Silverado.

Fuel tank sensor showed up as check engine light several times and Dealer in Wasilla, Alaska did not document or correct. Finally went out at 65,000 miles and fuel pump assembly had to be replaced. Any sensor should be replacable without removing fuel tank. Poor engineering.  I will not buy another RAM

ram,1500,2014,chris303, 01/30/2015,Love my Ram pickup!,4,"I bought my Ram 1500 new in November of '13.  After 26,000  miles, I can report only 1 repair (oil pressure sending unit fixed under warranty).  Gas mileage on a recent trip from Wisconsin to Florida varied from 20.5 to 25 mpg.  My Tradesman trimmed truck came with so much standard equipment, I don't know why anybody would need to spend more!

This truck rides and handles like a big American sedan.  The 8 speed automatic works great, though I have caught it napping at times when kicked down.  My only complaint is I wish the seats had lumbar support for my middle-aged lower back, but I suppose the higher trim levels may.  It's no surprise Ram won Motor Trend truck of the year twice!"
ram,1500,2014,mitchselect, 04/20/2014,Hard To Beat,5,"Although its hard to go go wrong with any full size truck these days except for maybe the Nissan Titan, the initial impression of my new Ram seems to be just a little bit better all around. Even if you have been a ""hater"" in the past, which many of us are, and for good reason, i strongly urge you to at least test drive one and give it a fair chance. You wont be disappointed. I found it to be the best performing, arguably the best looking, best optioned and with current rebates it was the cheapest. It is my belief that Ram Dodge Fiat (whatever) is trying to make a statement with this truck and in my opinion has done so! although i gave reliability a 5, only time will tell. GIVE RAM A CHANCE!"

Well, the past is the past. This '14 Longhorn simply outclasses the Fords across the board (for now, until FoMoCo stops resting on laurels.) Gorgeous, comfortable, luxurious, powerful, intuitive technology...it has it all. The ""Western"" themed interior is a little over the top (a bit long on badges and saddle-stitching) but it's crafted so finely, it's hard to say that there's something else you'd prefer.)
Here's the new bar for Ford, Chevy and Toyota to jump over. Good luck boys!"
ram,1500,2014,jbowen52, 07/11/2014,"Exceeds My Expectations, Still Runs Perfectly",5,"This is my first truck.
Previously had a Cadillac SRX and other crossover type vehicles.
 Decided most of what we did was hauling stuff.
We were surprised to end up with truck.
It is just as described in the reviews.
Comfortable, quiet, solid and gets better mileage than the SRX.
Solid 24+ MPG from Washington, DC to CT.
Averages 20+MPG in daily driving, incredible for a full size truck.
Being my first truck, the Fun To Drive category isn't really there.
While good for a truck, it isn't up to the handling of the SRX.
Still I knew that going in.
The V6 does a great job, hauls my camper and boats.
I tested the Hemi, but it didn't seem to need it.
Very happy so far.
UPDATE:   At nearly 20,000 miles the truck continues to perform flawlessly.   I am still very pleased with the V6 performance and have never required more.   Gas mileage continues to amaze me for a full size crew cab 4WD pickup.  20 around town, 23-24 on a trip.
UPDATE:   Now at over 37K, the truck continues to perform perfectly.  Still amazed by the performance and fuel mileage that I get with this truck.   Only issues have been a few minor factory recalls for locking and radio security.
UPDATE:   Now at over 50K, tires are just coming up for replacement, still no unscheduled maintenance.    Finally replaced tires at 52K, still running perfectly, 23MPG on trips, still AMAZING!

ram,1500,2014,Ebs58, 07/05/2017,All the right options for the price,5,"I have a 2014 with the Hemi, 8 speed tran and big horn package. 76,000 miles and the only problem is the check engine light has just come on at 75000 miles. It seems to be just a small vapor leak according to the code that the computer throws.  Maybe just a gas cap problem.  Other  than tires every 35000 miles, changing the oil every 5000 miles and a air filter every 12000 miles no other maintenance has been needed.  Just had to put all new brakes pads on at 72000 miles. I do mostly highway and suburban driving so I am averaging 18 mpg. Sometimes as high as 20 if I am on the interstate. From what i have read the Hemi is made in mexico and the transmission is made by BMW which is used on the larger suv and 5 and 7 series sedans. The seats are more comfortable than most pickup's I have owned except the the 2008 Toyota Tundra i had.  No other truck can match that back seat for comfort and room!

Updated review Jan 2018.  The only issue has been a check engine light that a small evaporation code was showing.   Replaced gas cap and seem to solve the problem.  I had another episode with the check engine light which was caused by not resetting the engine oil life change warning.   This also caused the remote start not to work.  It would start the engine but then shut it down after a minute.  Again, I have a concern about all the electronics that interact with everything so I will probably trade it when I get close to 100,000 miles when the warrantee expires. I still feel it is the best equipped for the price. A comparable Silverado has a much higher list price and a F150 with the same options is fairly close to the Ram.. A Toyota Tundra probably has the best reputation for reliability but doesn't offer comparable options. I had a 2008 Tundra with 180,000 miles on it and the only major repair ($1000) was the air conditioner compressor and evaporator. The only other money put into it was for maintenance--- tires, 3 sets of brakes, a fan belt, filters, and oil changes.

ram,1500,2014,johneb09, 12/18/2014,Made the switch,5,"We traded our 2012 Silverado in on this new Ram a few months ago, and so far, love the truck. The Chevys 5.3 ltr had very sluggish acceleration, and an irratic shifting 6 speed transmission. I test drove another new 2014 Silverado, a 2014 F150, and then the Ram. The 2014 Chevy was once again, sluggish. The Ford was ok, but the Rams performance and handling, IMO, was the one that was the most enjoyable to drive. The acceleration is amazing, and the 8 speed transmission is precise. The Hemi engine is powerful, yet we have been getting 25 MPG on the highway. Pretty amazing truck all the way around, plus it was priced thousands less than the Ford & Chevy."
ram,1500,2014,emmerth, 10/28/2014,Transmission Leaking Day 1,2,"I purchased this 1500 9-1-14 to replace my aging Titan (10 years old).  The dealership was offering some great incentives for the holiday and the truck seemed to be rated pretty good so I thought it was a no-brainer.  Until, I took it over my friends house (concrete driveway) and he informed me that I leaked transmission fluid all over it.  I then looked under the truck and sure enough, it was leaking.  Well, it has been to the dealer 4 times now and they still are having trouble fixing it.  It is now at the dealer again.  When they picked it up this morning, it had 1568 miles on it and most of them are from them doing test drives.  Contact Chrysler support yesterday and waiting them..."
ram,1500,2014,ScottoAZ, 07/13/2016,Electronics Nightmare,3,"Purchased Dec 2014, Laramie, Hemi, 5.7 4x4, first trip air flow to engine damper was malfunctioning.  Radio/Nav (Best one they offer) has been replaced 2x and still malfunctions. Window control module has been replaced, drive side mirror has been replaced, had to return it for the shop to reinstall the rubber trim correctly. Wipers come on with rain sensor without any moisture on the windscreen or in the atmosphere (4%) cannot find problem.  Alarm is set not to chirp, however when I lock it from the door lock and close the door it chirps 3x and unlocks. (nothing wrong they tell me) Truck interior venting makes a sound like a monster is yawning inside when they activate (thats the way it is they told me...HUH)  Both rear wheel well flairs had to be reinstalled by a autobody shop, coming off.  Door column trim (vinyl) had to be replaced 2x on drivers side. Its in now for fuel sensor not working and engine light on. Front left bearing or 4x4 hub seems to be grinding. Glove box latch sticks.....and the worst is after having all the repairs done I have to bring it back to repair the warranty work due to the sloppy mechanic/techns damaging items (while doing repairs) or getting grease on my leather interior and head liner.  I got my truck back for the second radio replacement and went with the service writer to reinstall bluetooth items and the freaking radio wasnt even installed all the way.  Mechanics need to loose money when they perform substandard work on clients vechiles.    This truck has been in the shop approx 5 weeks since I had it....and I thought my Ford 6.0 Diesel was a nightmare! 

UPDATE 1/13/17...radio still does not funtion very well, bluetooth connection on and off depending on the attitude of the truck.  Had a very lengthy conversation with DODGE rep at Dodge and explained all my issues. The rep responded approximately a week later with an e-mail suggesting I bring my truck to the dealer for the repair of stated issues......HUH didn't you hear a word I said. THEY CANT SEEM TO FIX THIS TRUCK. DO NOT purchase a Dodge. I understand from talking to outside mechanics that the only Dodge made part is the Hemi engine (which is patented) and most every other component is FIAT. No wonder!  Id stay far away form Ram trucks.

UPDATE 7/13/17...all issues previously stated are still a problem. Dodge sent a email review to me and asked how my last service went. Well have to say out of Dodge warranty and on the after market one so now I pay a deductable on their problems. Did not answer as they (Dodge liked) so they contacted the Dodge dealer I bring my truck to and Im sure bent the service managers ear...they called me in a panic.....I told them the truck has been in numerious time for the same problems and you can't seem to fix them...WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY! Now sitting on my desk is another recall notice....daHHHHHHHHH. Vechicles have been around for over 100 years....get it right! I don't need the thing to tie my shoe laces, get me from A to B safely. Dont buy a DODGE!

UPDATE 1/14/18....Still having the same issues, except now the electronics are slowing down...push door lock 5-8 times for it to lock. This morning after staring the truck the heated steering wheel and seat heaters didnt come on. Oh after about 2 miles they did. Radio is just switching stations after turning off truck and restarting. Radio at times just skips a beat meaning it goes out and comes back on after a second or two. Outside temp sensor, Im not sure it knows how to sense temp changes. It takes 5 miles to finally sense the outside temp. Vents still make the monster growling sound while the truck is not running and it is sitting awhile. Dodge mechanics cannot seem to duplicate.  Seems my mechanic where I bring it for a oil change knows all about the issue of venting noise. DO YOUR RESEARCH...Do not buy a Dodge....one more thing, this is not to be
 believed. My truck came with 20 inch chrome (plastic ) wheels and the spare Dodge put on the vechile is a 17 inch wheel. Now if your tire size is different on the spare, not so bad you dont drive too fast to the station, but a different size rim....WHAT are these people thinking. Im looking to get rid of this nightmare real soon.

1/15/2020 Ok folks radio went offline in Sept, and gear shifter knob was sticking and grinding...brought it in ""oh there is a radio upgrade"". Cannot find anything wrong with shifter....fast foward to 1/10/20 radio has blinker out 4 times, shifter knob is grinding and now I have a message on my screen, ""bring shifter in for service. Oh we cannot find a code for this says the dealer. Tech finds the code hidden in some obscure phantom megabyte. New radio is on order, 4th one. Well this truck is now on its way out of my hair....been to Ford, have one picked out.................its gone, too many problems, traded in, could not sell it to anyone with all the freaking problems..............

ram,1500,2014,canoe3, 02/02/2015,2014 Dodge Ram Quad Cab,3,"I've had my pickup for a few months now, approx 5,000 miles on it. Never all it seems pretty good, but there are a couple of annoying things - it was right around $30k (I'm in Canada).  It came without mud flaps, front tow hooks or any other trim.  I understand you could get those by paying for a higher trim level, but I feel all trucks should come standard with those (they are on the F150).  Aftermarket was fine though.  My biggest issue is with the fuel economy, which I expected to be not great as its a v8, but it's actually around 14mpg easy driving in the city, 16mpg on the highway. also, stock tires are horrible - if it rains (or aaagh - snows!) you're all over the road.

Upate at 4 years - issues with rough shift out of park whenever truck is on a slope, either up or down.  Have to apply a lot of force, and shifter 'thumps'.   Key fob sometimes refuses to disengage easily.  Asked dealership to look at it when it was only 2 months old, they refused without charging $300 for 'inspection labor'.  Would not buy another Ram simply due to difficulty with the dealership - in speaking with many other Ram owners, it's a known issue that the dealers will try to overcharge for practically everything, and our fleet manager told me to 'never buy a Dodge/Ram product, dealing with them on warranty issues is a nightmare'.

Aside from that, it still runs well and has never let me down.  Good price, both new and even better used (they depreciate like crazy).  You can pick up a decent one at auction here in Canada a couple years old and pay half the new price.  Better support from the dealer and I'd consider another one, but as it stands switching to GMC next.

I now have 25,000 miles. my two biggest complaints are no power seat and no radio controls on steering wheel. I simply could not find this equipment on a used truck in my price range. $25,000 to $27,000. I would have gladly paid a little more for these options. This truck is not ill equipped either. It has all power, windows, mirrors, tilt, cruise, tow package, running boards, factory bed liner, CD player Uconnect radio, 4X4, 5.7 . The sticker showed this truck at $42,000 new. Would like to see power seats and steering controls a bit more available.
Now I've had it for 4 years and 62,000 miles. My biggest complaint is the quality of the interior. The seeds stain very easily even with water it seems to leave a mark. The door panels scratch way too easily. I had a small cooler in the backseat and turned sharply and it slid into the door and left a 6in scratch mark that I can't get out. I had a drinking cup that I left in the front door cup holder and after about six months of putting it in and out I noticed I wore a 3-inch scratch right near the cup holder. I have to shampoo my car seats regularly to make them look new again and just have to live with all the little scratches and marks on the door panels front and back. Dodge needs to fix this problem.

Other than poor navigation updates and 2 rear wheel bearings that exploded at 7,000 miles I'm very pleased oh... Except heated seats suck. Can't seem to get a Dodge dealer to fix them.  Tried 4.  All say the work but then I show them what they are doing and the scratch their heads.
 
All Dodge service centers get a 2 on a 10 scale from me.  GM has best service hands down but you pay for it. GM trucks cost $8000.00 more for same type truck.  GM service gets a 10+.  
If you don't mind arguing with a Dodge service manager then you'll have no issues I guess.  

Just try to contact your local Dodge rep.  Ha ha.  Good frickin luck.  Ain't happening ever !!!!
Make damn sure you buy the CHRYSLER only extended Warranty. APex warranty sucks.  No renter car coverage for minor repairs.  Hope you have a spare vehicle or a ride.  GM will provide you a ride or car or whatever you want and always deliver your vehicle back you un detailed.  Dodge service will deliver it back with added filth on your interior.

I bought a 2014 RAM 1500 Express Blacked Out Edition Quadcab 4x4, with the 5.7L engine.  I test-drove the new Titan and didn't like it.  I drove this Ram and decided to give it a try.  After owning it for about a month, I can safely say I miss my Titan, a lot!  My 2005 Titan had more bells and whistles than my new 2014 Ram 1500.  The Ram feels fake and plastic-like.  I have the 6-speed transmission.  It is constantly shifting between ECO mode and normal mode.  I really miss all of the spaces in the doors to store things.  I hope it will be a reliable truck, now that I have a 450.00 dollar a month payment.

ram,1500,2014,MarkInNC, 07/27/2018,Ram 1500 w/ 8-speed transmission - AVOID IT,2,"Update: they are still using the same transmission in the 2020 and 2021 Ram 1500.  If you plan on owning your Ram 1500 for a long time, this is NOT your truck.  I purchased my 2014 Ram 1500 Sport 4x4, new, in July 2014.  I loved the truck for four years until this week.  Before I tell you why I don't think you should buy it, I'll tell you why I did buy it.  The styling was awesome, the power of the 5.7L Hemi was great, the fit & finish were good.  For 160K miles, the only problems I had were a wheel bearing (normal for it to wear out after about 120K miles) and a water pump, which broke after about 140K miles.  Everything else was normal maintenance.  All work was performed at the dealership.  As I approached 100K miles, I asked about servicing the transmission.  I wanted to replace the transmission fluid and clean the filters.  I was told, ""the 8-speed transmission is a sealed unit.  You cannot service the transmission.""  I was shocked, but reassured that it would be ok.  Well, it turned out to be a big, $5600 problem for me.  At 161K miles, I was told that I needed a brand new transmission.  The torque converter was malfunctioning, but you can't replace it separately.  You have to replace the entire transmission.  As you can see, I drive a lot.  For work, I'm just driving from one end of the state to the other, cruise control on.  I've towed my boat a grand total of about 50miles of the 161K.  No other towing or anything that would put undue strain on the transmission.  My last truck was a 2007 Toyota Tundra 4x4.  Lasted for 300K miles and I sold it for $11K (yes, you read that right).  If you want long-term reliability, get a Tundra.

ram,1500,2014,mike_d3, 06/16/2015,Smoking & Burning Oil at 8800 miles,3,"I have the 2014 Ram 1500 BigHorn Crew Cab with the 5.7L Hemi.  I purchased it new and have approximately 8800 miles on the truck.  If the vehicle sits more than 30 minutes, when I start it I get a huge puff of blue smoke and there is carbon/soot all in both tail pipes.  The brand new Hemi is clearly burning oil.  Either I got a lemon, or you should stay away from this gigantic hunk of junk!!  Ram has been incredibly defensive and hard to work with so far.  Biding my time and following the process to solidify my lemon law claim if they don't step up.

Update:  About two months after I wrote this review, and after four attempts to correct the problem (including rebuilding the top side of the engine) the manufacturer finally accepted my lemon Law claim and swapped the truck for a new 2015 of the same trim package.  This new one now has 36,400 miles and is going strong.
"
ram,1500,2014,GT, 01/30/2020,It was so bad I sold it within six weeks!,1,"So I don’t know if I just bought a lemon or what but this was the worst truck I have ever owned.  14’ Ram Crew Cab short bed with the 3.0 EcoDiesel with 86k miles.
It got WAY worst fuel economy than they said it would and it was a dog!  I don’t need a ultra-powerful truck, but I bought this for its ability to tow and it’s great fuel economy... it was horrible!
At best I was averaging 17mpg Highway and 15 around town.  Towing a small two place snowmobile trailer from Michigan to Colorado and back only averaged 14mpg!  I could get that with ANY modern truck!  Instead I was paying a .40-.50 cents extra a gallon for diesel fuel and still getting crappy fuel economy!  Oh and don’t think for a second that you can tow over 70 mph... if you kick it to 75mph the thing won’t ever see 8th gear and you can count on the fuel economy dropping to 12- mpg .  
You throw this in with the fact that I had to take it to a dealership THREE times in the few weeks I owned it for stupid little crap that a normal truck would not even have a problem with... it was just too much.   Don’t believe the hype.  The truck it nice but this setup needs a lot of refining before I will ever try the Fiat diesel again.
And just so you know that I am not just a Ram hater... I ended up getting the HEMI version of the exact same truck (2018) and I LOVE it!  I’m 20 mpg on the highway and 17 in town.  I haven’t towed with it yet but even if it is the same as the EcoDiesel I will be happy because I am still spending less on the cost of the fuel AND I have had NO problems with the truck.
I truly hope other people have better luck with this power train but for me... I hated every money sucking minute of owning that truck.

Oh yeah and if your wondering why this review is for the 3.0 EcoDiesel but the listing that I put in is for the 3.6 gas motor, it is because Edmunds did not have an option to select the 3.0 in the drop down menu for the 2014 truck.

ram,1500,2014,Sarahstar167, 05/21/2020,Don’t buy for the suspension,3,"Purchased this truck form a dealership and it’s a nice truck in a lot of ways but as soon as cold weather hit (we live in Canada) the suspension compressor went and it is completely unbearable. Dealership wants to charge $4000 to replace the compressor which they can’t even confirm will fix the issue. Basically whenever it is cold we have no suspension. We specifically bought for this feature as we have a trailer and boat to tow. Only other option is swapping out the air suspension for hard which apparent most people do. Shame on you Dodge for creating and marketing a feature that doesn’t actually work!

ram,1500,2014,4-Dezl, 09/26/2018,Now have owned all three of the big three,4,"I was a RAM/Dodge hater until I owned this truck.  I have the 3.0 EcoDiesel and purchased this truck begrudgingly because RAM was the only manufacturer to have the stones to put in a small turbo diesel.  This truck with 8 speed ZF transmission gets 30 MPG on the highway if you are careful.  Towing my 7500 lb camper, I get 12-14 mpg on the flats and 11 in rolling hills.  That is the same as my Duramax with 1/2 the displacement.  The Tradesman is the lowest trim model, but with some creature comforts like Uconnect touch screen stereo and carpeting, this truck is as feature rich and comfortable as any.  Even more so when you consider the 4 corner coil springs to smooth out the suspension.  I did have to add airbags to the rear coils to help with porpoising when towing the camper, but for $80 it was worth it.  Turbo lag will always be an issue, but this truck loves to pull and will make 340 ft/lbs of torque when required and over 20 lbs boost.  I would buy this again.

ram,1500,2014,Tom Castle, 08/23/2018,"So Far, still love this thing at 80,000 miles!",5,"Update: 09-05-2019: 
All of today, my below is still just as valid as it was when I wrote it, below.  However, now my truck just turned over 80,000 miles.  As a previous owner of two Honda Ridgeline EXL trucks, leased new, I'm still a bit concerned about the longevity of the Ram, likely because my wife and I have been Honda leasers/buyers for so long.  None the less, today, I'd also say this is my favorite truck yet.  It still runs, drives, rides and handles great and, really, as good as the day I leased it for 2 yrs. in 2014, lured to it by a crazy good 2 yr. lease deal.  Back then I knew the new Ridgeline body style was still a year or two away and, surely, I could live with this thing for a couple of years, right?  Well, after 2 yrs., I didn't like the way the new Ridglines looked, and still don't, but I liked this thing and ultimately bought it.  At that time, I planned to trade for something new in 2019 or whenever the Drive Train warranty died.  Today, I think I'm just going to keep driving this Big Boy a while.  I'm still scared that something major may happen and cost me a bunch, but I'm not a big fan of extended auto warranties either (maybe I should be).  In fact, if I were to trade in the near future, I'd get another Ram just like this one and I’d still get the V-6, but now with the new mild hybrid system.  Frankly, for my needs, this 2014 V-6 has plenty of power and it can tow 7,400 LBs with the 3.55 axle ratio, if needed.  Also, I'm still getting the same great MPG as noted below.  In fact, it gets about the same overall MPG as my wife's 2016 Toyota Highlander XLE.  Today, I'd have to say that Fiat (FOA) has done a great job with the Ram Truck line.     


Original Review:
First, this is really a Pentastar V6 2WD Crew Cab, Short Bed, Big Horn, (not Laramie, as the Edmunds options didn't have a crew cab, V6 Big Horn option). My truck is silver with dealer added leather, ""Kat Skin"" seat covers  which are great and look great as well. I get a lot of compliments and everyone thinks their factory leather. After 69,900 miles and I still love this truck. It is big, comfortable, quiet and it handles and rides great and still with zero rattles. It rides better than any Ford, GMC or Ridgeline I've owned. I had no intention of buying this thing, but I drove it and liked it. Honestly, I was scared to death of a Dodge/Ram/Fiat truck, and I sort of still am, but it has really been great. It may croak tomorrow, but it really runs great and has given me zero issues. At first there seemed to be slack in the rear axle or 8 speed tranny, but after a couple of software updates it went away. Sounds crazy, but it's true! Additionally, it has excellent power for a V6, (305 HP) and my overall MPG as of today is 21.6 MPG. In winter the average moves up to 22.5 MPG, I think it breaths better with colder air.  For a V6, this thing has a sweet rumble as well. On a road trip this past week of 400 plus miles and setting the cruise on 71 MPH, the overall MPG went to 23.6. I usually drive faster, but I was ahead of schedule for each bus meeting and drove slower. Around town on both expressways and streets the MPG will drop to about 19.5 MPG, but moves back up on the road. Even at 80 MPH it will average 20.5 to 21MPG.  If I'm not mistaken, it can tow 7,400 pounds and it tows very well. Really, how much power do most of us really need anyway? Sure, some need more or want more, but this Pentastar V6 is amazing. Today, I'd say I'm likely to trade for a 2019 just like this by spring. The 2019s look great and the reviews seem good as well.

ram,1500,2014,Jimmy Tee, 03/05/2020,1st time shopping for a truck and RAM blew me away,4,"I've always bought SUV's/Crossover's with 4×4 or AWD because I live in the country and the winters can be bad and I always ""thought"" keyword for the price point a SUV/Crossover was just as good with alot of the same features for less, but after sliding off the road hitting a guard rail that totaled my vehicle. I wanted a better built vehicle that was going to be able to handle snow/ice rough roads and the dreaded ""pot hole season"" in the spring that can really cause significant wear or damage to the suspension and wheels/tires. So I decided to buy a truck. I wasn't big on Ram cause my father owned a 06 RAM 3500 Cummins diesel it ran great but the interior was cheap alot of hard plastic with some with wood grain graphics it looked and felt very cheap. 

  Over a 2 month period I drove F-150's, GMC/Chevy and Ram's all kinds of different trim levels. While every brand had it's strong points or unique features some more gimmicky than others but I kept coming back to the RAM and the difference between my father's 06 and my 14 was unbelievably huge.

 The quality of the material used is 2nd to none the dash and doors are covered in a stiched leatherette material the seats are very supple leather, wood grain and the cherry on top the tech/screen size of the very user friendly Uconnect and digital dash, and last but not least the comfort and pleasure of the ride is best compared to a large luxury sedan with a powerful engine. The huge change from my father's ridged stiff ride in his 06 RAM. While I lose some money going from a 4 or 6 cylinder to a Hemi V-8 it's not nearly as much as I would have thought and is more than made up by the quality and craftsmanship the only con I can think of is that I thought the rims to be solid chrome rims, but come to find out it's just a chrome plastic over I don't know what is enough to take away 1 star cause I didn't even know until I went to polish them. I don't know why they went that route with the wheels.

ram,1500,2015,Tom, 09/15/2015,The best 1500 pickup I have ever owned,5,"I have had several Dodge/RAM, Chevy/GMC and Ford 1500 pickup trucks over the last 20 years. My last truck was a 2012 RAM Hemi Crew Cab 4wd. That had a 6 speed auto transmission. The new one has an 8 speed. This is the best transmission ever invented. I have had about 70 vehicles in my lifetime and I cannot impress upon this feature enough. Not only do I average 20-22MPG in mixed driving (I don't floor the hemi very often), but this transmission seems to read my mind. It is always in the right gear. I love the looks, the seats, the comfort of independent suspension, the UCONNECT and many other things about this RAM...but the 8 speed automatic is outstanding! When you can get 20-22mpg in a 4WD crew cab with 400HP, you are doing something AMAZING. My sister bought the same vehicle with a few more bells and whistles and she has hit 24mpg on the highway. Love this truck!

ram,1500,2015,Kent, 05/16/2018,(Still) Best vehicle I've owned.,4,"Updated 11/21/2020.  I just passed the 200,000 miles Mark.  I fixed the window leak.  There was debis in the drain line for the sunroof that I flushed out. I'm almost due for another set of tires and brakes. Also, the drivers seat ""leather"" is cracking from sliding in and out of the truck. 
I put some repair material on it and it is hardly noticeable.  Otherwise, things have been good.  No other issues.  

Updated 11/16/19. I have over 168,000 and I'm starting to have more problems.  I had to replace both front wheel bearings. I have a small water leak (I think at the top of the windshield), the interior map lights only work some of the time, and the engine knocks for a while when started until the oil pump warms up (I've heard this is common). However, it's got 168k miles, so some of this stuff is to be expected.  I'm on my 3rd set of tires (the first being the ones from the factory), I've replaced my brakes and rotors once, and had a tune up at about 150k.  I went to the shop to get 3 or 4 minor recall issues fixed (originally was told 8-12 hrs, but actually only took about 3 hours), and otherwise this has been a great truck.  I've been looking to replace it with another 1500 Ram.

Original review:  Every vehicle has a few flaws, and this is no exception, but I really love this truck.  I've had the truck about 4 years now and a few issues are coming up.  Drivers window auto up/down only works some of the time, and sometimes makes a loud vibration noise going down.  Also, the front dome lights don't always work,  and the only mechanical issue is a engine knocking that I've been told is very common in ram trucks, and goes away once it has warmed up.  Still best vehicle I've ever owned.

Update 5/16/19:  I still love this truck, but I've had several recalls on it which I'm told will take 8 to 12 hours total to fix, so I will have to rent or borrow a car for a couple of days.  I have almost 150k miles on it.  I'm almost ready for the 3rd pair of tires.  1st pair made it to about 80k.  I put new brakes and rotors on for the first time at 120k.  I haven't come across any new issues with the interior or exterior (same issues still exist from original review.)  I am thinking about buying a new Ram this summer because I've liked this one so much.

Repairs have been a light switch & an alignment both at 196,000.  The engine is quiet & smooth as is the 8 speed transmission.  At 65 mph unloaded it averages 30 mpg.  Towing a typical 26' Airstream TT from Ohio to the west coast at 65 nets between 15.0 & 17.0 mpg depending upon headwind.  Its an efficient & comfortable long distance commuter or moderate weight tower.  The quiet smooth ride is more road compliant and handles better than any other truck but is too soft under a load without either the factory air suspension or supplementation from one of the aftermarket axle to frame air bag companies. (TLC, Timber Grove, Air Lift) Mine benefits from an aftermarket tune with an engine brake for safely descending grades with a trailer.  Still have original brakes.  Truck also has optional trailer brake controller. Tune also provided some power and mileage and minimalized re circulation of EGR soot.  Never had any emissions problems. The 1500 platform as well as the motor has its limitations if you plan to tow 9,000 pounds or 33+ foot TT you would be better served by a HD.  Short of that its a great truck and I would buy another one.

ram,1500,2015,Paul, 08/14/2015,So far...I really like it!,5,"I bought a new 2015 Laramie 1500 4x4 in June.  So far it has met and even exceeded most of my expectations.  I traded in my beloved 2006 Toyota Tundra 4x4, however I didn't know what I was missing.  The Laramie, for being a good sized truck drives extremely easy...its crazy.  The interior is well designed and easy to use.  The Uconnect system is one of the easiest systems I have ever used.  Everything from the GPS, Bluetooth, air conditioned/heated seats and setting up internet in the truck is simple.  The Alpine system puts out incredible sound and the speakers in the ceiling is just cool in my opinion.

The 5.7 Hemi, 8 speed transmission w/ 321 gears...is also one of my favorite features.  The truck has a lot of power!  I have averaged from day one--17 MPG.  I have seen as high as 22.7 on the highway and as low as 14 pulling my boat.  My Toyota never saw over 19 MPG and it's 800 lbs lighter and had 125 less HP.  So I am very happy with the Laramie's mileage.  Hopefully as it breaks in even more, I will see a little higher MPG.  But, fair warning...the motor puts out 495 hp.  If your heavy in the gas, your mileage will suffer.  I have experienced that when my wife drives haha.

The only item I have had trouble with in the keyless key FOB.  On occasion, I have had my key FOB on me while I'm in the truck...but the truck didn't pick it up, which meant the truck wouldn't start.  My truck starts with a push button, not an actual key.  So I had to get out of the truck, lock and unlock it, then I got back in and it started.  Yes, that will irritate you.   That's my only complaint.

I am experimenting with a KN filter right now, to see if it helps or hurts my mileage.  I will post later what my results are.  I have heard it both ways 1) that it helped  2) that it hurt your mileage.  So after a few road trips using both (stock filter or KN)...I will have some actual data to share.

My truck is a Cowboy Cadallic.  Dodge really did it right this time.  I am extremely pleased with it...

ram,1500,2015,Mark, 11/26/2015,Just got the truck of my dreams,5,"The crew cab proves to provide plenty of room for a family of 4.  I drive a lot of miles and wasn't sure I should get the hemi or the v6. The v6 proves to get great mpg at 20/25 on a full size truck and power is not a problem pushing 305 hp it does the job. Quite cab and lots of comfort. The only thing that upset me was the $800 charge they wanted to charge me for the navigation download so I use my garmen gps that I paid $100 for and get free updates for life. Come on ram give the navigation with the truck.  I do love my ram truck though.

ram,1500,2015,nica21, 06/28/2015,Poor in gas mileage,5,"I had a 2014 chevy silverado 1500 with 27 Gallons and the average in gas was 17MPG and I just purchased a Laramie Longhord edition 1500 with 32 Gallons and the average is 11.6 MPG. I drive my laramie normally without speeding but I was very upset about the mileage. According to Dodge is 15 City/20 Highway. Everything else is very nice and comfortable.

ram,1500,2015,Gregory, 12/27/2015,"Engine disintegrated at 15,000 miles.",1,"I was in love with this truck.  It had everything I need in a truck: great ride, towing, and fuel efficiency.  All was great until I was driving home from an out-of-state trip.  About 200 miles from home, in the middle of nowhere, my engine died on the interstate while I was do about 65.  Fortunately, I pulled over safely and contacted roadside assistance.  It was a Saturday.  Their solution, as per their contract, was to tow me to the nearest dealer, in a small town.  The dealership was already closed for the day and would be closed on Sunday.  I had to be at work on Monday, so this wasn't an option for me.  Fiat Chrylser America couldn't help me; their ""roadside assistance"" was to leave me stranded in a small down for days.  I had to pay out-of-pocket myself for my Ram to be towed home so I could at least go to work.

It turned out to that the resonator blew.  The local dealership held it for several days and returned it to me repaired.  Two weeks later, my ""low oil pressure light came on.""  I dropped it off at the dealership and after a day or two they called me back and told me there was metal in the oil pain.  The engine disintegrated and I was told it would be replaced under warranty.

Today is day #30 without a truck.  I have opened  a case with Fiat Chrylser America and have talked to their customer-service representative once.  She was very nice, but unfortunately I haven't received an update in about 10 days.

Overall, I regret purchasing this truck.  I've spoke with other Ecodiesel owners on Ram forums and it seems I'm not alone when it comes to dead engines and difficulties with Fiat Chrylser America.  

I will happily update this review if there is a happy ending.

UPDATE:  There wasn't.  The truck was a lemon.  Traded it in at a substantial financial loss to myself for another brand of truck which has run wonderfully.  I will never deal with Fiat-Chrysler ever again and will make sure everyone knows my experience.

ram,1500,2015,leroyminjarez, 05/31/2015,Great Truck Just A Few Issues,4,"I have the '15 Reg Cab Ram 1500 V6 Black/out Edition. My Ram was affordable. Also, I love the mileage and the overall look. It just has issues very early on. I have owned the truck since Feb '15 and have 5k miles. My first problem I had was at 400 miles after my radio just stopped working for about 2 days. After 2 days it luckily started working, well kind of. Next after around 600 miles my front bumper has blemished paint spots that look like the sun ""burnt"" this area. My truck is regularly kept under a car port and washed/waxed w/ quality product. Oh & my Bluetooth doesn't work anymore and Pandora capability is a joke! "
ram,1500,2015,Robert Butler, 11/16/2015,From Ford to Dodge (RAM),5,"I have been Chevrolets and Fords for over 25 years.  This is my first Dodge primarily due to my fathers advice that Dodge's have great power trains, but horrible everything else.  Times have changed, at least with respect to the ""everything else"".
Keep in mind, I have only had this truck for a month and only have 3,500 miles on it, however, here are my first impressions.
This truck (Ram 1500 SLT Crew Cab with Big Horn package, Hemi engine, 3.93 rear diff) runs like a scalded cat.  The ride is not like a Lincoln Towncar... it is a truck, I would hope not, but it is very smooth and quiet.  The advertised 15mpg city / 20mpg highway is a pipe dream, but I suspect the rear differential may have something to do with that.  On the positive side, I am getting about 16.5 mpg highway while driving 80mph through the Texas hill country.  City driving is about 14.5 mpg so not that much worse than advertised.
The turn knob shifter took some getting used to, but I appreciate the space recovered from where the shifter would traditionally be.  My only complaint is that some of the A/C controls (changing from dash vents to floor vents, etc) must be done via the touch screen.
Overall, I love this truck.

ram,1500,2015,Josh07, 04/01/2016,Best truck ever,5,"I recently bought a 2015 RAM 1500 SLT, and cannot be happier to own and drive this truck. Aggresive look, engine is strong, but drives so smooth, interior is made of quality materials and awesome MPG! Hope it will last for a long time, before I consider getting another replacement. Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

ram,1500,2015,Jim, 01/01/2016,2015 Ram Bighorn Ecodiesel Review,5,"Just passed 53,000 on my Ecodiesel, and still love it.  

This truck is exciting to drive with seemingly endless torque and plenty of horsepower combined with amazing fuel economy, luxury, and good looks.  I've had no major issues; this is the 2nd Ram truck I've owned and been very happy with both of them.  I would recommend the Ecodiesel without hesitation.  With the Ecodiesel being a newer platform for Ram, I hope my satisfaction continues and this proves to be a smart and worthwhile purchase.  As of now, I will say it has been the best all around vehicle I have owned.

ram,1500,2015,ramrust, 04/24/2015,2015 Ram Rusting Chysler or Dealer will not fix.,3,"I purchased a 2015 Ram 1500 quad cab 9 weeks ago it has 1800 miles and its rusting already on the body. Dealer nor Chrysler will do anything about it. I have started a website showing the rust on mine and photos and videos of several trucks on there car lot that have rust and flaking paint problems on the rocker pinch weld. Its a shame because other than that I love the truck. I do not like the way the dealer and Chrysler have shrugged it off when its clearly a manufacturing flaw. [HTML removed]

ram,1500,2015,Randy Veatch, 11/27/2015,No complaints on FCA,5,"Went from 2010 F150 to 2013 Ram with Hemi, to this 2015 Ram 1500 with Eco Diesel.   Been happy with Ram, fuel economy on the Eco Diesel is good (21 city, 25 hwy) but the Hemi was more fun!   My experience with Dodge / Ram / Jeep has been good over the years, from 1995 to now between my wife and I having Ford, Mercury, Chevy, and several Dodge / Ram products and my wife now has a 2014 Grand Cherokee.   We have had just as many problems with other brands (fuel problems in 2010 F150, bearing went of rear diff in 2007 Tahoe) and have no complaints on CDJR products.  Love the quiet of the diesel in my 2015 Ram, and the 8 speed transmission in the 2013 and the 2015 are the best transmission I have ever driven.   They could have a little better quality of the plastic on the glove box, and I miss my glasses case in the roof of my Ford, but overall been very satisfied.

ram,1500,2015,waverunnerjer, 06/13/2015,2015 Ram 1500 Reg Cab 5.7l Hemi,4," I traded in my 2008 ram 1500 5.7l Hemi SLT for a new 2015 Ram 1500 Reg Cab W/Hemi. I bought the Black express package, emblems painted body color, delete Hemi badging, SL model. I have almost 4k miles on the truck and no issue's so far. Only small problem I have is with the door's staying open. The lower hinge's have shallow grooves and on my slanted driveway I have to make sure to hold the door at the second groove (all the way open) or else the door will slam shut if this is not done. My wife and I feel this is a saftey issue and I am not sure if all door hinges on the Ram truck's are made this way. I will follow-up on this issue with the dealer. Other than that I really like my 2015 Ram,"
ram,1500,2015,Steve, 04/20/2016,"Over 10,000 miles. Ram Rebel 5.7",5,"I have owned this truck for just about 8 months now and felt I could give it a proper assessment.  Zero issues to report.  I have the 5.7 with the 3.92 gears and 8spd trans.  I have averaged just around 16mpg in mixed driving conditions.  While towing a 7,000 lb camper (which this truck does effortlessly) I average around 11 mpg.  Two of my favorite options are the ramboxes (storage compartments accessible from the outside of the bed that utilize the space above the wheel wells without compromising bed capacity (still able to load 4x8 sheets of plywood and drywall no problem)).  My second is the adjustable air suspension which can lower to allow ease of entry and raise to an off-road dedicated 10+"" clearance height.

Interior - spacious and comfortable in both front and back seats.  There is so much leg room in the quad cab rear seats this truck easily carries linebackers in the back in absolute comfort.  The instrument cluster is programmable as to which display you want to see in the center and what data to appear on the corners of the digital display and is intelligently flanked by the large rpm gauge and speedometer.  This is truly the most comfortable vehicle I have ever ridden in.  Storage is ample and everywhere.  under back seats, storage wells in floor boards, behind back seats, door pockets, seat pockets, center console, dual glove compartments...The ram boxes are extremely useful and allow larger tools, hunting gear to be stored and locked in sync with the remote, or through a couple bags of ice and a case of your favorite beverage and  you are the tailgate king.
Included as part of the Rambox package is a ram embossed heavy duty plastic bed divider which also serves as a tailgate extender as well as a Ram embossed tonneau cover which folds into thirds to allow tall items in the bed and easily folds back into place to cover the bed.

Performance- The 395 HP Hemi is amazing.  It really is a fast truck when you get up on it, but rides with the comfort of a luxury sedan.  The exhaust note sounds deep and throaty when starting or accelerating and just loud enough to sound impressive without be obnoxious.  Even with the 33"" Off-Road toyo tires included as part of the rebel package you would never know it from the inside of the cabin.  Lots of people complain about the shift knob, but I actually like it.  It frees up a lot of space in the center console area where a center shifter may go.  It's beefy and easy to use and you will never mistake it for the radio volume knob.

Also get the 8.4AN stereo option (9 speaker Alpine system with a subwoofer)  the nav is meh, good compared to other vehicles, but with iphone apps such as waze and google maps.  The stereo sounds fantastatic and never feels strained when cranked up to 11 on the volume know ( you know, 10 and One).

I always love driving this truck.  I get many compliments and although it's not the cheapest transport option out there, The Ram's are very competitively priced and I was able to get mine at 8,000 below sticker.

ram,1500,2015,Ram Fan, 05/25/2017,Love my 3.0 Diesel,5,"I have a 2015 Ecodiesel with 59000 miles. It has towed an 18 ft car hauler and a 12 ft Dump trailer about 25K of those miles. It has not had one single problem since new. The fuel mileage beats the EPA estimate and it is very comfortable to drive. I have driven it a 1000 mi in a day and found it as comfortable as any car. My favorite features are the towing mirrors, the shift knob, USB ports, interior storage, driving feel and the way it looks. I have owned many Chrysler products and they have all been very trouble free. UPDATE: It now has 71,000 miles and still not one problem. It still has the original brake pads. I change my own oil and it is one of the easiest oil changes around. I buy the Rotella T6 from Walmart and the Mopar filter from amazon and the cost for an oil change is about 85.00 dollars. I sold this pickup because I found a great deal on a Big Horn Eco Diesel with 22k miles. It now it has 49k miles and has been just as trouble free as my first one. As soon as the Eco Diesel comes out in the new 1500 I plan to upgrade. I love the Eco Diesel. I now have 60.000mi on my second Ecodiesel with no issues. It has been across the US twice (9000 mi each time) it is smooth and quiet and runs close to 700mi on a tank of fuel. My best mileage has been 30+ and my worst was driving across South Dakota 84 mph with a 40 mph head wind. It dropped it down to 21mpg. Now have 70k miles. Still love it and no issues.

ram,1500,2015,Glenn, 01/22/2018,Just Ram it!!!,5,"To me, the biggest Ram selling point is the smooth ride.  The Ram is the only truck that has a coil rear suspension.  Everyone else has a leaf-spring rear suspension.  The ride is terrific.  You do give up about a 1000 lbs in towing capacity and 100 lbs in rear cargo.  But ask your yourself, ""How often do I tow 10,000 lbs?""  For most people the answer is never.  But you will enjoy that ride every mile.  It is a tremendously better ride over Ford or Chevy or Nissan.  I have owned them all.  My last two trucks have been Dodge.  Another point is the Rambox.  It is a space saver for me and worth every penny.  I use my trucks on a farm and I have towed 10,000 lbs upon occasion.  Ram gets he work done and I ride in style and comfort.  My 2010 Dodge had 145,000 miles when I sold it and never a problem.  My 2015 has 80,000 on it now and no issues.  I do service my trucks right on schedule and it pays off.

ram,1500,2015,Travis, 12/10/2015,Nothing but problems and no help from RAM,2,"I can't start to explain how disappointed I am with Ram. I bought a new 2015 Ram 2500 diesel 1 year ago. I have had it in the shop almost 100 days total and 35 days 1 time alone until I had to pick it up to tow my trailer. The problems are from the window regulator, stereo, tire pressure monitoring system, transmission will not shift correct and finally just wouldn't start today and left me stranded. The brakes don't work and they found an internal leak but issue still isn't fixed. All issues are verified but none have been fixed. Some people at ram have been nice while others want to make it nothing but hard for me to get any thing done about it. Finally after my case manager told me ""there's nothing we can do about it and if You want a different outcome to seek arbitration""  I did open a case with NDCS and turned in my evidence for arbitration and they left out my main letter and told me it's too late to do anything about it now. They also held the meeting in Texas when I live in Arizona and wouldn't tell me where if I wanted to attend.  At that point it was a one sided argument besides my service records. Arbitration awarded me a new truck but after going to the dealership today and picked out a new truck. I would have to get a new loan, my down payment and monthly payments I made would be erased and my loan will be for more than the original. 0 compensation and told me I will have to swap all my after market parts like leveling kit, wheels/tires, amp power steps, remote start, bed tow prep package, and aftermarket tint. It has been the worst experience I have ever dealt with and not the experience I expected when buying my first brand new truck. Everyone from Ram points fingers to others and no one can help or point me in the right direction. I have been waiting for a call from Ram directly to se what we can do again but it's been over a month after they told me 1-3 days twice In a row and erased my case. After calling in and finding out it was erased I had to re open one and start over. Ram customer service SUCKS

ram,1500,2015,2nd NEW ram truck disappointed customer!, 06/03/2016,2nd Ram with problems!,2,"This is the second NEW ram truck we have owned.  The first was a 2011 4x4 crew cab that we loved but was part of the huge recall where the back ends need replaced, which really put a bad taste in our mouth since we had been driving this truck pulling campers and boats for many years with children on trips, knowing they should have recalled this years ago and knowing we weren't ""safe"" was a bad feeling.  Dealership said it would be 8-10 weeks without our truck to repair, really??  So we traded it in!  Bought a new 2015 4x4 big horn with the longer bed, love it!!  But each time we started it up a big cloud of white smoke blew out the tale pipes.  We contacted salesman, who said to put first 1000 miles on it and if it's still did it to bring it in.  At 5,000 miles husband does first oil change and only 2 quarts of oil comes out (it holds 7 quarts)!!!  We take it to dealership explain this, they hook it up and say ""it has to be water vapor, nothing's wrong with truck"". We continue to drive it, we are adding a quart of oil every 1000-1500 miles!  That's a lot of oil this truck is burning!!  We now have 10,000 miles and decide they are going to figure this out.  We take it in to dealer, nothing leaking oil outside engine so they mark the oil level and tell us to drive it 1,000 miles and bring it back in so they can ""document how much it's burning then send a request to Chrysler dodge fiat to see if they will allow them to replace or repair engine"".  So now we play their game... I think it's ridiculous! We pay $45,000 for a brand new truck that burns oil like a 20 year old truck?!?!  Just to be told they may or may not fix the problem... As much as we have loved our 2 ram trucks, if they don't fix this under warranty, it will be the last dodge Chrysler anything we own!!!!
"
ram,1500,2015,Ryan, 10/28/2015,Less happy with the truck since my last review,4,"It's a Chrysler, so reliability is poor.  I trade premium pickups every two years and prior to this MoPar I had a Ford F-250 and two GMC 2500 HD's before that.  First the Ecodiesel and 8 speed transmission are awesome.  My actual fuel mileage is what Ram says it should be.  Other than expensive oil changes and fuel filter replacements required every 15,000 miles, I have no complaints as to the drive train.  The product as a whole irritates me often.  With the last 3 pickups over the past 7 years I've never had an issue with recalls or repairs with the GMC's or Fords (not counting that piece of crap 6.0 Powerstroke Ford built 4 vehicles ago) but the recalls and breakdowns of this Chrysler irritate me.  A sensor took 5 days to repair and resulted in the Ram being hauled from my home on a truck.   Ram refused to take it to the dealer where I bought it and stuck me with a local village idiot.  I drove 50 miles to avoid the local dealer and buy the truck because the local dealer is the village idiot, Ram can't haul a $54K pickup an extra 50 miles?  Now, the real reason for me going to the trouble to write a review about a truck that is actually pretty nice.  The navigation.... map updates are $150!!!  Are you kidding me?  I can buy a Garmin and stick it on the windshield with free lifetime updates for a little more than $150 and the Ram radio that is an extra $1000 for navigation costs me $150 to update?  Unbelievable.  Stick it to me Chrysler, see if I come back.  There are other really nice pickups out there.  I'll probably have one of those others next time.

This is the update on the Ram.  I've downgraded several items from my first review.  The main thing I see that irritates me is decreasing fuel mileage.  I initially got 27 highway and was pleased.  I've not seen that in a while now, it has dropped overall about 3 or 4 mpg now with nearly 60,000 miles on the truck.  Navigation is irritating, I refuse to update the maps when I can have Siri just take me where I want to go so I consider the navigation option a total waste of money.  I replaced the OEM Goodyear Wrangler SAE  tires with what I hoped would be better tires, and am running Bridgestone Duramax all season tires.  They create more road noise, ride much harsher than the Goodyears and don't seem to have any better traction.  I should have stayed with the Goodyears.  The recalls have been a real hassle.  My dealer is slow and it is irritating to have to update the software, change out the entire exhaust and etc.  I knew this was a possibility as the ecoDiesel in my 2015 was a beta model, but the hassle has been a bit more than expected.

Another update 5/2/19.  I've had this pickup much longer than I usually have a vehicle and will trade soon as I'm approaching 100,000 miles and the end of my extended warranty in anticipation of MoPar reliability issues.  I haven't traded as I'm waiting for Ford or GM to come out with comparable MPG in a half ton and they are quickly getting close, fingers crossed.  No real changes in my review, just more of the same.  I've had an intermittent engine warning light for some time and the local dealer seems uninterested in fixing it.  I ran a code on it and found the cold start system isn't communicating between sensors.  Irritating, but standard MoPar quality, eh?  The Bridgestone tires have quieted down but the idea they are ""all season"" is a joke.  Don't plan on them getting you through any real mud or snow, they are just regular tires for a ""gentleman's"" truck.

However, its normal for a bone stock diesel engine to blow at 84,000 miles. Im a mechanic myself so all oil changes and maintenance was done on time and I even used top of the line filters and oil. The truck gave no prior indication of failure. Im driving it down the road one day under normal conditions when suddenly it start to knock really bad. Im in no place to pullover so i limped it to the nearest turn off. It dies, I start it back up and have no oil pressure and I know by the sound that I had just blown a rod. I get it into a parkingblot and shut it down. Get out to inspect and its pissing oil. Dealer says its catastrophic engine failure and Ill be getting a new engine, under warranty.

The smoke was caused by a failed EGR Valve Cooler which led to a cracked intake manifold.

ram,1500,2015,ItsAllGood, 06/03/2016,14000 on my 2014 Express 5.7L,5,"This truck is really nice  . . . . color is Blue Streak Pearl Coat . . . . I get comments on it all the time. 

This truck had the upgraded UConnect  5.0 . . .  it is much nicer than anything else I have had.

I am 6'3"""" and I really love the size - super comfortable seats. They are the gray cloth. Cabin is really comfy. I call this truck the 400 HP Barcalounger

Engine - So far so good . . .14 MPG around town I have seen to 23 MPG highway. I have seen haters call the hemi ""gutless"", but I cannot figure out what they are talking about. The engine is a runner, pulls solid off the bottom, but seems to come on to the cam at about 3500 - 4000 rpm. It is fun to drive. I have done some towing (mulch) . . . .  put her in Tow/Haul mode. It did not complain any. 

Tranny - Got the 8 speed. I was a little wigged about no dipstick. But this is apparently a high end tranny. I guess i will worry about it when I need to. I would like to do a fluid change at 50K. We'll see. For now, it is the smoothest tranny I have ever seen. Lightning shifts, almost imperceptible. Almost magic. You CAN catch engine and tranny napping at times. Engine in MDS ECO mode, tranny in OD then when you step on the gas it has to wake up.  I guess this is how it gets 22+ mpg highway.  

Issues up to now - One day the shifter locked. It cleared up on it own. Also, the 3rd brake light on the cab was leaking some. I got weather stripping and fixed that myself.

If this truck does not turn to a pumpkin, I'll probably hold onto it until I trade it in for a Buick Regal (probably when I am 85)

ram,1500,2015,Lou Green, 01/04/2016,Eco diesel lot of problems,1,"I bought my 2014 Dodge Ecodiesel for the fuel economy and roominess it offered.  I will say that my ram 1500 quadcab does ride well and gets great fuel economy in the summer.  I average 24 mpg and have seen as high as 30 on the highway.  Winter time those numbers drop 3-4 mpg here in NJ.  The problem with this truck is it has proven to be very Unreliable. Before its first year anniversary it spent 39 days at the dealer for repairs.  An electrical meltdown best describes the issues.  They used trial and error and replaced lots of parts, each time waiting several days for new parts to come in.  The dealer service is the pits.  I swapped dealers last week and more of the same.  AC, cruise control and a starting issue are still being addressed.  More parts ordered and more time at the dealer.   I will be shopping for a replacement very soon.  Buyer beware !
Update:  traded the Ram in and no longer own this truck.  I found most dealers offered less trade in value for that Ecodiesel than the gas engine model even though the diesel is an upgraded option.  

I'm at 42000 miles and tried to trade the RAM in on a Tundra, however the word is out on the ECO diesel and now resale is very poor and this is for a truck that commands a premium dollar for the diesel option.   Looks like I'm stuck with it till the 5 year/100000 mile warranty runs out.
Update2: Finally found a dealer that gave me a trade in for a 2016 Ram gas engine model and so far so good.

ram,1500,2015,Clayton, 04/21/2016,Give one a try,4,"First off, I had a Lemon.  Took it to the dealer 3 times for steering vibrations that could not be resolved.  Dealer was a pain in the behind but FCA was great to deal with.  They bought the truck back.  I didn't even ask for it. 
2nd Ram is great!  Going on 26000 miles and it's solid.  Only have been back to the dealer for small things.  Like uconnect updates.  
It rides like a car, plenty if power.  Consistently 21+ mpg on highway.  Very comfortable seats.
My conclusion.  Very well designed truck.  Prolly the best of all truck brands.  I'm not brand loyal either.  I go with the best product.  However, the unions are what plagues these truck companies.  Unions should be busted up.  That's why reliability is hit and miss.  These guys might be pissed off at management one week and put together a string of sloppily made trucks.  I've been part of a union and they aren't good for the auto industry.

Update:  this Ram has 37k miles on it and it is one solid truck!  I love it.  No squeaks or rattles, and very reliable.

Update:  57k miles and still drives like a new truck.  I keep it waxed and clean plus all maintenance.  I've had small issues so far.  This truck is very fun to drive!

ram,1500,2015,freeza_143, 04/06/2015,Ram 1500,5,"Recently bought a 2015 Ram 1500 crew cab with a V6.  I ordered it especially with everything I wanted and did not want.  This truck with the V6 is powerful with outstanding gas mileage.
Added a step to truck bed access and lights for the bed.  Outstanding truck!  Mercedes interior with a truck bed.

July 23, 2018 update:  Great truck with no issues.  I've driven this truck on several trips and get approx. 21 to 23 MPG.

January 23, 2020 update:  46,000 miles on truck with no issues.  Great truck and love the V6 engine and 8 speed transmission.

ram,1500,2015,GeoffreyXE, 01/26/2017,I love my Ram single cab Hemi!,5,"I bought my Ram about two years ago brand new. Its Bright Red with step bars, chrome wheels, bed liner, tow hitch, and tinted windows. I have 22k miles on the odometer now. All in all the truck has been the best vehicle I have ever owned. However, its my first new vehicle. Most of my cars and trucks before this one were 10 or 20 years old. The 5.7 Hemi has plenty of power, probably to much. 3.92 rear gear axle ratio. The 8 speed auto seams to keep the power at the wheels at all times which comes in handy while I am towing. And, I tow a lot! Almost 95% of the time I am towing a 4k pound box cargo trailer. Fuel economy varies depending on what I am doing. If I am towing around town with a lot of stops then I can see 13mpg. That's stopping a lot too. If I am towing but on the interstate going 70mph then I am looking at 15mpg. Towing on back highways going 55mph and I am getting 20-22 mpg. Not towing in town with frequent stops 20mpg. Not towing on the interstate at 70mph 26mpg. Not towing on back roads at 55mph 30-32mpg. My right front tire wore out after 17k miles on the outside tread. Maybe from towing all the time. I always enjoy getting up in the morning and looking out the window at my truck. I think its one of the best looking trucks ever made! Thank you Chrysler!

ram,1500,2015,Jason Janacek, 08/23/2019,Lifted Above The Rest,5,"I have been in the New Car and Truck business for well over 25 years now. I have driven them all and the winner is clearly this Ram 1500. I bought this truck in January 2016. And had to have it shipped from Kansas to Texas as it was one of the only white Sports I could find in the country. On day one I drained the oil and filled with 5w 20 Royal Purple and now with 97,000 miles it has never been in the shop. And folks I DRIVE my truck. I don't coddle a vehicle. I put a lift on it at 25k and have been running 35"" MT tires since then. I didn't buy a truck to get good gas millage. You want that? buy a compact car. I bought my truck to hunt and fish in. And I drive it everywhere. Bottom line is I could have bought any truck I wanted to at a great price. But I chose this truck. Oh, and by the way, so did the other manager at THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP we both worked for as sales managers. Would think the GM would have an issue with that? Nope...he already bought a 2014 and understood.

In the 4.5 years I have owned it, the only thing needed other than normal maintenance has been a new switch for the cruise control, and a software upgrade for the Uconnect system,(which is fantastic). IT IS THE MOST TROUBLE FREE TRUCK I HAVE EVER OWNED!
When it was new, it came with 20"" wheels. I can't imagine why anyone needs 20"" wheels on a truck!  Unfortunately, they were shod with Goodyear Wranglers, which are junk! 
I sold them and found some nice oem 17"" wheels, and put on Michelin LTX tires.  Huge improvement in ride comfort! 
I added navigation to my Uconnect system. It works extremely well, and the entire system is very intuitive to use (I am 63 and hate most of the new electronics).

I have air suspension, Ram boxes, convenience package, sunroof, skid plates, navigation and 3.55 gears in the rear axle. I love this truck! I did a ton of research on all truck brands and it came down to this truck or the 2015 F150 with the 2.7L V6. In my opinion the configuration of this truck - the V6 Pentastar with 3.55 gears, and 4x4. Is the best drive train on the market.

I have had no other trouble with the vehicle other than a tailgate issue early on that the dealer fixed. I am getting great hwy mpg as I travel a lot for work across Co, Wy and Ne. I recently put the truck up for sale and it was sold within 2 days at KBB pricing. I purchased a 2018 Ram Laramie with the eco diesel engine, that I will pick up next week. It would be hard for me to switch to any other truck considering the success I have had with this one. I have owned a Toy Tundra that was fine other than the interior is a little uncomfortable. I had a brand new Chevy 1500 Silverado Z71 4x4 which I wanted to get rid of within 6 months because of the internal rattles and noise. I have owned a used 2007 Ford F 250 Diesel Crew which I enjoyed other than the lack of interior features and comfort.

I'd say this truck is super cheap in the mechanical quality area and mediocre in everything else. Interior is OK but everything feels very cheap, steering wheel wore down super quick and everything's cheap plastic. Horrible blind spots, doors creak bad, etc. I've never owned a vehicle with this many issues, big and small. I'll never buy a Chrysler vehicle again, should have told myself that when our jeep wrangler was messed up to before we bought this truck.

First off, we live in California so the recalls are non stop and the whole settlement for loss of power and fuel milage is a joke (signed up for it 2 years ago and have heard nothing). The truck is great, we've had no problems other than the crap accsesseriers. The charger is falling out, the Bluetooth works intermittently, the damn dash squeeks like crazy, and now our windshield washer fluid light keeps popping up but the fluid is full...

I am worried about reduced resale value based on federal lawsuit. I am worried that a""fix"" will reduce power and milage. I am worried that a ""fix"" will reduce milage and/or power.

ram,1500,2015,Apks, 10/22/2017,Ecodiesel issues,2,"Truck fan great for the first 18 months of ownership.   Averaging 27-28 mpg in mostly  highway driving.  Very comfortable truck.  Performance has been excellent as well.  At 62,000 easy miles, the issues have begun.  EGR valve is clogged and ""can't be cleaned"".  EGR cooler is leaking into the exhaust system (common problem)  FCA won't even return a phone call. All parts are back ordered for 3-4 weeks because so many of these trucks have the same problem.  Dealership has been very good and is trying to help me but FCA won't stand behind the dealer or the customer.  No rental vehicle, no help getting the parts, and no guarantee that these parts that I'm paying for ($3,100) will even fix the problem. The only way these ecodiesels will make it beyond 75,000 miles is to go with an EGR tune.  These are the only ones that are functioning well.  The problem is it can void the warranty.  I really like the truck when it's functioning.  The most disappointing part of this experience is FCA when the issues begin.  I've never been a fan of extended warranties but, for this truck, You better have it.  Most repair jobs are done by throwing parts at it until they find the issue' expensive and backordered parts.  I would gladly trade out of the Ecodiesel for the V6 Penstar motor.

I wanted a bigger truck that got excellent mileage that I could haul my kayaks around in and / or travel to streams to do some fly fishing. The Pentastar V6 is exactly what I wanted, good gas mileage and plenty of power. I never tow heavy so that was not on my list of needs. The biggest highlight to me is this truck rides as nice as my AWD Ridgeline, smooth and quiet, and efficient with low-mid 20s mpg. The Ram should better on the beach sands with true chain-locking 4WD (one of the reasons I got the Outdoorsman instead of a Bighorn, which has the clutch 4WD version. Super nice cabin, remote start and heated seats and wheel are a must for the man who spends cold days hunting or fishing. Plenty of storage room. Great infotainment system with Uconnect. One issue is fog light brackets wear, causing some highway shake. Ram has made replacement fog lamp brackets that are reinforced as a fix (revised “rev” in part number. Overall, thumbs up!"

However, its normal for a bone stock diesel engine to blow at 84,000 miles. Im a mechanic myself so all oil changes and maintenance was done on time and I even used top of the line filters and oil. The truck gave no prior indication of failure. Im driving it down the road one day under normal conditions when suddenly it start to knock really bad. Im in no place to pullover so i limped it to the nearest turn off. It dies, I start it back up and have no oil pressure and I know by the sound that I had just blown a rod.

Finally it went into limp mode with no warning when we were on the highway and dropped us to 40 MPH when traffic was at 75 MPH. This was as close to a wreck as I have ever been in. Took to first dealership to be told I had to leave it with them for 2 weeks (Nope not a typo) to do a 30 minute reset. Next took to dealer where I bought it. I paid $56K for the truck and at 12789 miles ( No typo) they took me for $1362.00 to repair it. Told me I used wrong oil, oops they did the first and only oil change.

Example, I have lived here in MD for 10 years now and this Ram is the 6th vehicle I have owned, and I am on year 4 with it. It still runs and drives like the day I bought it. I routinely tow close to 7,000 lbs all summer with no issues, I get around 20 mpg when hwy driving (not towing) and around 17-18 mpg mixed. The only repairs have been a small rear transfer case seal leak and the very well known issue with the exhaust manifold bolts breaking at around 65,000 miles. Both were replaced under the 5 yr 100,000 mile limited warranty. The only other maintenance has been 10,000 mile synthetic oil changes and the transfer case/differential fluid changes at 60,000 miles. I haven't even changed the brake pads yet. I went to buy the new Ram, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

ram,1500,2016,Chris, 11/23/2015,2016 Laramie quad cab 3.0 L Motori V6 diesel,5,"On 9 September 2015 I ordered a 2016 DS1P41 Ram 1500 Quad Cab 4x2 140"" WB, 6'4"" box... 28H customer preferred package, a Laramie.. EXF 3.0L VM Motori V-6 diesel, DMD 3.55 Rear end, DSA Anti spin rear end, WFJ 17"" wheels, AHC Trailer tow, XHC Trailer brake control, and a few other options... MSRP 46,860 / Invoice 42,670 / Net, Net, (less Holdback $1,370) $41,300... purchased for $41,900 less $2000 rebates, $39,900...( I personally feel the manufacturers have gone nuts on their pricing... their excuse is that they are competitive, bad argument on their part.)
Ok,  in my 63 years of life, about 20 of those years, I sold rolling stock to Federal, State, county, and municipal political entities and large and small commercial accounts. These vehicles included Chrysler, Ford, cars and trucks, and Sterling class 4 through 8 trucks... So as writer of this review, I am no nut case... I have driven them all... 
As for the dealer, they came in on the weak side... little or no product knowledge, customer satisfaction rating will get hit with an average rating, maybe... but, after saving a ton of money, I acquired my new ride on the 3rd of November 2015...had the dealer not had screwed up, I might have had the truck a week or two earlier...  As of this writing Sunday 22 November 2015, the truck now has 1587 miles... My first 100 miles, at 65 mph,  she clocked in at 33.1 MPG. way better than advertised... The following weekend of 6 Nov. 2015, I logged a good 580 miles at 80 mph, a lot of low rolling hills, some flat plains,  good weather, a bit of wind, low humidity, normal temps, and she got a whopping 28.9 MPG...  the majority of this ride consisted of more road miles with probably 50 miles of urban driving,  this is way better than advertised... as for performance, if you lay that foot on the accelerator, you will be bounced into the back seat... for an itty bitty V-6, she's got some guts and power... 
As for the power source, the VM Motori diesel, she's not like any diesel that is out on the road... Most power sources that you find in domestically built trucks, ie, cummins, cat., detroit, powerstroke, and GM's Isuzu motor all have or have had an excessive valve knock... this was always standard issue with diesel motors... The Motori, it's so quiet, you can hear yourself think... this little power box is actually quieter than some gas engines... If you are into quiet engine operations, this is a good choice... In the cabin, you can actually hold a normal conversation with other occupants.
Fuel expense, even though the price of diesel is a bit higher than gas, with this truck and power source you can expect at least a 30% improvement in miles per gallon compared to gas... My first 1500 miles, I have spent less money on diesel fuel than my old gas truck... substantially less... 
As for handling and ride, this truck is nothing compared to what Chrysler or Ford built back in the 80's or 90's... An option was available for an air ride suspension, I couldn't justify the added expense, or future maintenance costs 80,000 miles down the rode... but, she is smooth, little or no road noise, no road harmonics... Power steering, it's electric, no more steering juice to feed to it, no more steering gear leaks... and as for precise handling, it's up there... handles like some low profile road cars.. without the stiff rides... As high as the truck stands, you would think that in the curves the G forces would be against you, they are not...  you would think that you might have some pitch and awe to contend with when attacking curves, she stays straight and goes where you point her... little or no over or under steer...as for wind noise, Nada... none...  
The Sterling Acttera, a class 6 truck had a 65 degree cut in her cornering, it could out corner any F-350 to 550 on the road... the Ram 1500, she's there, I do not need a football field to turn her
 around...  but, historically, Dodge trucks were always known to out maneuver Chevy's or Fords... 
If you are still reading this review, and you're and ole guy like myself, something of note, the back up camera, make sure you get it... the Uconnect radio system has this huge interior screen, when you turn the knob selector to reverse, that camera lights up everything behind you... I ordered the front and rear sensors, it's well worth the expense... Parallel parking is a breeze, and backing up to a trailer, is so much easier now.  I am not having to get in and out a half dozen times  to see where the trailer tongue and hitch is...  
One other thing that you will need to get used to, transmission selector, it's a knob, electrically controlled, no more column shift. It seems and feels weird at first, but you'll get used to it...

While it is not a sports car I find the power to be good for daily driving and have no issues passing or merging into busy rush hour traffic. The V-6 is quiet and has a nice growl to it when the pedal is pressed to the floor. For the savings ($1200 less than the Hemi plus $1000 additional rebate) I am happy I went with the Pentastar. With the 3.55 rear end I can still tow 7000 pounds and I am getting 20-21 MPG in mostly highway driving. 

The RAM is the most comfortable full size pickup on the market in my opinion, although I am disappointed in the lack of some safety features like front crash mitigation and blind spot monitoring. The Unconnect system is hands down the best infotainment system on the market including luxury manufacturers.

ram,1500,2016,Christopher Faber, 03/31/2017,Dodge Ram 1500 Crew Saved Me!,5,"I was involved in a accident in which a driver crossed into the south bound lanes, from the north bound lanes.  The driver clipped the tail end of my Dodge Ram which sent me spinning splitting a telephone pole in half causing me to rollover 4 times.  All air bags deployed and the bed of the truck, the wheels and various other parts of the truck were destroyed, but the cab stayed in tact allowing me to walk away from the accident with only neck strain from the seat belt.  I believe the well built truck saved my life and will be replacing the totalled truck with another Dodge Ram.  Great job Dodge on the engineering of this truck.

ram,1500,2016,Jeff Lawton, 12/14/2015,Much Better Truck than my Old Tradesman,4,"Mostly my comparison is to the 2012 Trades I had before purchasing the Sport.  I saw this blacked out optioned truck on the lot and fell in love with it.  It looks great and I get lots of compliments!  The bucket seats are far more comfortable than in the Tradesman.  Acceleration off the line isn’t as good due to the higher gearing in this specific Sport.  The new 8 speed tranny is so much better than the old 6 speed.  Very smooth shifting, very little of it trying to find the right gear.  The 6 speed in the Tradesman was always clunking around, always looking for the right gear to be in.  I didn’t like the way it shifted from the beginning and did have to take it in at 65K to have transmission work on it.  I was really nervous about the warranty running out and having to pay for a new tranny.  But I got the lifetime power train warranty on the new truck which was the primary reason for going back to the Ram.  Gas mileage has been in the 17-18 MPG range.  Although I live in a hilly area I still can't imagine getting 21 MPG.
The Uconnect system can be a little distracting.  The high beams are awesome.  The truck came with a big subwoofer that sits under the passenger side rear seat and takes up 2/3rds of the rear under seat storage.
With 700 miles on it I am loving it!

Update: I now have 10,500 miles on the truck and still like it although the tranny isn't as smooth as in the beginning.  When coasting and getting back on the gas it has a little trouble finding the gear it wants to be in.  I am missing the extra space I had in my old extended cab compared to this Quad cab.  I still have not been able to get more than 19 mpg (only once) and generally still in the 17-18 range.  The air conditioned seats are ""ok"".  Not great.  Not worth the extra money.

ram,1500,2016,ted, 03/09/2016,great truck,5,"if you are looking for more bang for the buck, then you really dont have to look any further than the ram 1500. ive done my research and shopping and you by far get more with the 2016 ram 1500. ford wont even try and match it. (and they are looking to get rid of the v8 engine by the way). although chevy will try and match the pricing (did my research with that too), they still dont give you the dual exhaust.  i test drove the ford f150 and the chevy silverado and the ram 1500 beats them both. fords interior is nice. chevys interior is nice. but again, the ram 1500 interior is more luxurious. besides the fact that you also get a free 1 year subscription with sirius satellite radio with dodge. chevy and ford were only 6 months. and about that horsepower.......395 hp with the ram. chevy and ford dont give you that much. the passenger seating in the back is also very comfortable with the ram, and more comfortable than the chevy. you get alot more for your money with the ram 1500. this is my second ram 1500 lease and i am very satisfied with this truck. so satisfied that i just might be it outright at the end of the lease. for the life of me, i really dont know why anyone would want any other truck.

ram,1500,2016,Rod Reichardt, 12/28/2015,Awesome Luxury Truck with Econo-Box Mileage,5,"This review is for a 2016 Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn 4 wheel drive crew cab with the 5'6"" bed with the 3.6 liter turbo diesel motor. This is my 3rd Ram truck in the past 10 years and easily my favorite of the bunch. I live in Texas and I like driving a truck. In the past I have had difficulty justifying the purchase price and the poor fuel economy because I really don't NEED a truck that often. It is useful to have a truck sometime but I don't need one on a regular basis. I do occasionally pull a trailer that is around 5000lbs but I only use it 4-5 times a year. My 2013 Ram 1500 with a Hemi pulled the trailer easily but mileage took a nosedive into the single digits. With the Italian built 3.0 liter diesel my new Ram gets 17+ mpg doing the same job. Overall without the trailer I am getting 25-26 mpg in mixed driving. This is just amazing for a 6000 pound 4 wheel drive truck. It seems that with the EcoDiesel you can have your cake and eat it too. In my case that means I can use a big heavy truck as my daily driver and still get fuel economy that is solidly in the 20s. In highway driving it is possible to aver 30-31mpg as long as you stay below 70mph.  

You can probably tell that I am a fan of the V6 diesel option in the Ram. So what is the downside? Initial cost is one issue. The diesel is a premium over the gas V6 or even the Hemi V8. Maintenance cost is also higher. Oil changes happen at 8000 miles for the diesel versus 10,000 for the gas motors. If you want to DIY the oil changes you'll find that the filter runs about $50 and the sump holds 11.5 quarts of synthetic oil. You'll also need to replenish the 8 gallon DEF tank every 9-10,000 miles. The fuel filter also needs to be changed every 20,000 miles or so. So if you're considering the Ram EcoDiesel purely to save money then you might want to do the math first. It will take quite a few gallons of low sulphur diesel to offset the additional costs associated with the diesel. If you can make the equation work out in favor of the diesel I think you will enjoy the ride.  The range is usually well over 500 miles from the 26 gallon tank. It's not as punchy off the line as the hemi (I haven't driven the gas V6) but doesn't feel slow either. There is some definite turbo induced lag from a dead stop but once underway there is no trace of lag and you feel like you're riding a wave of torque. In normal driving the truck feels plenty quick. In full throttle runs it runs out of breath sooner than the hemi. If you don't do a lot of full throttle sprints the diesel will feel as quick or quicker than the V8. Part of the credit for the seamless torque from the EcoDiesel goes to the 8 speed auto transmission. Shifts are smooth and quiet. I have yet to catch it hunting for the right gear. The rotary dash mounted shifter takes some getting used to. After 3 weeks and 1300 miles I don't notice it much anymore. Compared to my 2013 Ram this frees up a lot of space on the console. The Ram 1500 has coil springs at all 4 corners and the ride benefits from this. The truck handles well given it's size. I am amazed by how large half-ton trucks have gotten these days.
 
I think the interior of this truck is something special. I looked far and wide to find a truck with the black/cattle tan interior. It has various wood trim panels that are actually made of real wood. I know that wood trim in a truck sounds silly but I think it looks great. My truck does have heated front and rear seats along with a heated steering wheel. I have really appreciated that the last few days with the temps near freezing here in Central Texas. The front seats are ventilated but I haven't really used those as I bought the truck in December. The crew cab has a really roomy back seat though my son has complained that the seat backs are too upright for him.  The rear seat folds up and there are foldout panels underneath to give a flat
 load floor. There is some storage under the seats but on my truck much of that space is taken up by the subwoofer that comes with the Alpine sound system. Sound quality  is better than the base system but seems a bit harsh to me. The UConnect system with 8.4 inch screen works great. I would love to see Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration but the Garmin based nav works well as does the bluetooth. It works nicely with my iPod touch and my son's iPhone. Messaging works well with my Galaxy Note 5. I love the Sirius TravelLink with weather (reports and radar) and traffic. Driving through Dallas the day after Christmas it warned me of tornadoes and at one point gave me a message that there was a tornado reported in my location. My son looked up and we were directly under a large funnel cloud. The ParkSense system and rear camera are a must IMO. 

You can probably tell that I love this truck. It was not cheap with an msrp of $56,184 and only time will tell how the EcoDiesel holds up. Go drive one and see for yourself.

ram,1500,2016,Doug, 08/26/2016,Bighorn to a Laramie,5,"I recently traded my 2013 Bighorn 4x4 crew cab for 2016 4x4 crew cab Laramie. The exterior of the trucks are quite similar, except for the OEM Flares standard on the Laramie, nice look. Going from the Bighorn to the Laramie is a step up in ride quality, reduced road and cabin noise. My wife commented on the smooth and quiet ride on a recent 4 hour trip. The 8 speed transmission is smooth and quiet, no jerking or lagging, it's always right there.  There is also a noticeable difference in fuel effeciency, both trucks were v8's but going from a 6 speed transmission to an 8 speed is a huge improvement in fuel economy.  The interior of the Laramie is impressive along with all the technological enhancements, this truck can respond to your every command and can keep you connected by hands free phone, text, navigation, music and on an on! I have been in 2016 Ford and 2016 Chevy and their ride and power don't compare, plus their technology leaves much to the imagination, small screen interface and complicated instrumentation!

ram,1500,2016,Jared Kreamer, 03/17/2016,Ram knocked it out the park with the 2016 Big Horn,5,"The 2016 Ram Big Horn Crew Cab 3.6L is by far the best bang for your buck! The V6 models are very impressive on both power and fuel economy. Having owned 3 Dodge trucks prior to this recent purchase I was doubtful that the V6 model would be anything close to the mega cab hemi it was replacing. I remained open minded while shopping for this truck and decided to test drive the V6 model. Boy am I glad I drove this thing! The 3.55 gears with the towing package really utilize the engine power and that wonderful 8 speed transmission is smooth as butter. Fuel mileage is above what the window sticker claimed in city and highway driving. All aspects of this truck have been outstanding. The 8 inch touchscreen controls is a must have as well. If your in the market for a new truck, do yourself a favor and test drive one of these....you and your wallet will be amazed!! I must admit, this truck makes me enjoy driving all over again!

ram,1500,2016,Reid V., 07/30/2016,Unbelievable Diesel half ton,5,"Initial review - I purchased a Laramie EcoDiesel crew cab 6'4"" bed 2 weeks ago. It's the nicest riding vehicle I've ever been in. It soaks up the bumps and dirt roads with ease. The 3.0 diesel is amazing. The trip home from the dealership (155 miles, mostly HWY) I managed 27.4 mpg, over the EPA estimate. Part of this due to the fantastic 8 speed transmission. It's always in the right gear and never ""hunts"". Acceleration is OK, but I didn't buy a ~6k lb  vehicle with a small diesel to drag race. I test drove a hemi and it was straight up fast, also unnecessary. The leather interior is awesome and the ventilated seats work very well. Rear storage is excellent and fold flat floors work well. I've only had 1 issue with the Uconnect system, but a reset fixed that. Pandora, Bluetooth streaming and USB ""browsing"" all work excellent. The Alpine sound system is good for me, I'm not a huge audiophile though.  Stock tires are mediocre, but most vehicles have this issue so no negative marks.

15000 mile Review - Still loving the truck. Fuel mileage has dropped a bit with the colder weather and winter fuel. I've been getting 24-25mpg with routine driving but can push it closer to 26 mpg if I really try. I have been using the block heater and winter front cover too. The latter really helps the engine warm up at highway speeds when it's below 0 and windy. No reliability issues or CELs. 4wd and LSD has worked fine in the snow although, again, the tires are just mediocre. The heated seats take a bit longer than expected to get warm, not a huge deal.   I did take a ~1000 mile trip to Maine and back right after my initial review. With 3 guys, a bed packed full of gear and a 20' aluminum boat (also with gear) we got 18mpg. A very hilly trip too and I was pulling 75mph a good portion of the way.

68000 mile review - The truck is still performing excellent. I've moved to running AT tires (Nokian Rotiiva AT) instead of the stock SRAs for the 3 warmer seasons and have lost 1-2 MPG depending on how I drive. I also downsized to 17"" wheels with snow tires for the winter and have lost a little more most likely due to the cold weather. Currently averaging 23-24 with normal winter temps. When it gets below 0 or I'm speeding excessively / towing a small utility trailer that does drop a little. I do get oil undercoating every late fall / early winter and so far only a few small spots of surface rust on the frame, most likely high wear areas. 

 CONS - @ 34k my SAT radio stopped working.  The entire head unit was replaced under warranty. Right before this winter I noticed a little water had made it into the cab at the rear passenger corner. Turns out the 3rd brake light gasket isn't the best design and needs to be replaced. I'll get on that in the spring. All of the other issues were my own fault...

ram,1500,2016,Mike, 07/28/2016,Big Ole Big Horn part 2 & 3 and 4,5,"7 months in and still a happy camper, I installed a K&N intake and it did kick up the growl but minimal impact on mpg. I am getting about 16.5 in everyday driving but it is important to note I have the towing gears not the stock gears so that has a lot to do with it. If I had to do it all over again I would get the normal gears. It still will move if you press the gas and the intake growls that big truck will blast off and I really like the acceleration. The ride and ammeneties are great no issues. I would not hesitate to buy another Ram. One year of ownership and still going strong had two minor issues one was a check engine light that led to a fuel pressure sensor needed to be replaced. It did not have any impact on the way the truck drove just the annoying light on the dash so they fixed it and that was all covered under the warranty. The second issue I will have fixed when I take it in for service. One of the front parking sensors slid out of the bracket that holds it it. The bracket is broke so I have it taped in place it still works fine just need a new holder. No big deal to me. Otherwise still love my Ram I have towed my RV (7000 lb towable) several times without issue. It is my everyday driver and it will really move when I need it to. Gas mileage is now hovering around 17.5 so maybe that sensor had something to do with it? The biggest thing that impacts the mileage is me, love the growl and when I put my foot in it gas mileage suffers but it will move and sounds great. Love my Ram no regrets.
Now a year and a half later no new issues and gas mileage is about the same. I still love my Ram and by now have towed the rv to the foothills in Georgia without issue. This baby pulls like a mule no hesitation. I would gladly buy another one so it’s obvious I am a satisfied customer.
Over two years now as a daily driver and still happy with my purchase no major issues would definitely buy another Ram. Gas mileage hanging around 17+ the biggest help is putting the average mpg indicator next to the speedometer that curbs my tendency to put my foot in it.

3 years of ownership and still as satisfied as ever no issues and the only real change is the mpg has increased to 19 mpg average and it has hit a one time high of 21.9. Love my bighorn and would buy again without hesitation.

3.5 years in and no issues, my Ram is old dependable. It is a daily driver and the gas mileage seems to have settled in around 18.5 mpg. Still would buy again no regrets.
4 years of ownership and still a happy camper. No issues and would definitely buy another Ram 1500. Nothing has changed as far as mpg and it is still my daily driver, it is a dependable workhorse. Love my Ram and still no regrets.

ram,1500,2016,Frank D, 09/11/2016,Eco Diesel is excellent. Quiet and smooth.,5,"We bought the 1500 Big Horn Crew Cab with the Eco Diesel ( I couldn't select the 3.0 diesel engine in the drop down menu).  Got a good deal, a little over $10k off MSRP.  Just took at 3500 mile drive and it was a pleasure.  At 75 mph we were getting 26.5 mpg, so about a 700 mile range on a tank full.  When we were doing 55 mph we were over 40 mpg.  I figure I used about 2 gallons of DEF.  The ride is so smooth and quiet.  When I ride in my 2012 Subaru Outback It feels so clunky compared to the Ram.  This is the most expensive vehicle I have ever bought, but I am enjoying it.  We added nerf bars, spray in bed liner and trifecta cover.  After having it a month we are over 4500 miles and no big issues.  We have the towing package so the side mirrors are huge. We did take a hit from someone in a parking lot, but it folded in, so only a small scuff mark.  In parking lots we now fold in the mirrors, manually, the Laramie has power mirrors.  Our only complaint is wind noise.  We think it is coming from the mirrors.  Above 50 mph it is noticeable and a little of a distraction.  I may take it into the dealer to get it documented.  Overall, highly recommended.
UPDATE 3/12/18  The wind noise still is a little bothersome, but not terrible. It may be coming from the windows, but it is hard to identify.  Curious what will be going on with the ""Diesel-Gate"" Chrysler finds itself in. Seems like the same thing that VW was caught doing.  I am sure there is a settlement of some sort coming to EcoDiesel owners. I have received nothing from Chrysler, which is disappointing.  My Winter mileage has dropped down to about 24 mpg on the highway.  I am sure this is due to a combination of the cold and the fuel cut with kerosene.  Overall I still very much like the vehicle.

ram,1500,2016,krisnitori@earthlink.net, 01/05/2017,Ram Rebel cold weather window issue,3,"Purchased a new Ram rebel in Sept 2016.  Everything was great up to the point when the weather started to get cold --live in OH.  All four windows started to malfunction during the cold weather. The widows keep getting frozen and when you tried to roll them down -even after warming up the vehicle they would go down after pushing the button up and down.  Finally the window did lower after pushing the button, but it just completely dropped straight down into the door frame. Took the vehicle to the dealer to fix the problem on all four windows.  The dealer indicated that in cold weather the clips holding the window snap if there's to much resistance.  So, I'm now on my third trip to the dealer to fix the windows every time the temperature gets below 32 F.  Ram needs to figure out this problem; otherwise DO Not buy this vehicle if you live in cold weather.

ram,1500,2016,David, 09/28/2016,2016 Ram 1500 Big Horn Hemi,4,"Bought 30 days ago and has 1980 miles on it. Vehicle went to the shop 2 weeks after it was bought for a defective HVAC Vent actuator. Air would only blow on your feet regardless what you selected. About 1 week later same issue occurred and a HVAC Control Module was replaced but the dealer reports that the issues still persists and they do not know what could be the issue. Waiting on Ram technical support to help out, rental was provided until fixed. First Dodge Ram and not really to impressed at this point.

Update: 34k on vehicle and since the above issue has been fixed nothing else has gone wrong with the vehicle. Interior is still holding up along with paint and no rust spots at this point.

ram,1500,2016,BMD, 09/10/2017,2017 Bighorn V8 4X4,5,"We traded for a slightly used 2017 Bighorn 4X4 Crew Cab with the 5'7"" box.  Original sticker price was 48,475 and we ended up getting it as a Chrysler Certified vehicle for 33,000 because it was traded in for a Jeep Wrangler by the original buyer.  The original buyer felt it was too big for what he wanted after driving it for a few months.  This truck has the Bighorn Package with the safety tech and 20"" wheels, heated seats/steering wheel option and cold weather package. It also has trailer towing and a dealer installed tonneau cover and heavy duty Westin running boards.  We looked at Ford, Toyota and Chevrolet/GMC along with Ram during the winter, but were either underwhelmed, or price shocked by all of them.  During comparisons, it was obvious the Ram was superior to all the others in perceived build quality, and interior refinement for similarly equipped vehicles.  The seating comfort was noticeably better in the Ram, as was the ride, handling and quietness. You can travel on uneven roads at highway speeds yet carry on a normal conversation with people in the back seat, or hear the radio without repeating yourself, or turning up the volume to get over the road or wind noise. In fact, the truck rivals some luxury cars in quietness.  The 5.7 engine also seems to pull better and feels stronger than the others. The 8 speed transmission is silky smooth and shifts seamlessly, at times you can't even tell it is doing so.  The hemi engine is smooth and quiet, but has a noticeable ""Growl"" when you step on it.  The Ram has them all beat hands down.  I am not going to say the Ford, GM, Toyota are not good trucks, because they are. I'm saying that of all the good trucks out there, the Ram struck me as the hands down better vehicle and at a much better price. UPDATE: Sept 18- After owning the truck for a year my opinion hasn't changed much. The truck now has 31000 miles and hasn't had a single problem, which should be expected nowadays.  There have been three recalls for minor issues.  Though recalls are a bit annoying, its nice to see swift action when possible issues arise as opposed to corporate ignoring or refusing to acknowledge problems. One recall was for the electronic shifter, second was for the cruise control and third for the tailgate latch. The first two only required simple computer reprogramming, and are complete. The third one involves the tailgate latch and is awaiting parts availability.  My truck didn't display any of the alleged problems that generated the recalls, but was updated anyway. There have supposedly been some incidents of tailgates coming open by themselves, so RAM is putting a latch block on the trucks to prevent it. Again, my truck hasn't had the problem.  This truck has performed pretty much flawlessly to this point and I plan to keep it for some time.  The only thing I would trade it for is another RAM truck.

ram,1500,2016,Tom, 10/23/2016,Fit and finish doesn't live up to the price tag,2,"I bought a new 2016 RAM 1500 Limited on September 30 to replace my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 Big Horn.  While there is plenty to compliment about my truck with respect to ride quality and power , it is extremely disappointing as I have discovered poor finish in terms of exterior paint (numerous fish eyes), minor visual damage to interior trim, and poorly/losely fitted exhaust components.  I just completed my official RAM buyer customer satisfaction survey noting these concerns.  A week has passed and no response from RAM.  It's clear that spending $58,000 dollars for a luxury truck doesn't matter.  All of this said about my new 2016 RAM, none of it was a great surprise as my 2012 had some serious fit and finish issues that I had to have corrected with my dealer.  My RAM is nice and I stuck with RAM this time around as my truck was assembled in Michigan (engine built in Mexico), unlike the GM full size trucks now built in Mexico and Ford I didn't consider at all (just not a fan of the Ford product).  But again, I wish RAM would listen to its buyers on these concerns.  I spent serious money on this product and it should be delivered in a fully quality inspected state.  Based on my experience having bought two RAMs, quality assurance with respect to fit and finish is not part of the manufacturing process.  Another aspect of my new truck I find highly frustrating is with the UConnect and Pandora.  One reason I traded and seriously upgraded my truck is to have a vehicle with Pandora navigation controls on the dash.  I have invested time in going through the proper steps to setup the UConnect in the truck and on my iPhone only to informed through a call to UConnect Assist that there are unresolved issues with the UConnect system and Pandora.  As such, the Pandora app will not load on my UConnect system and to listen to Pandora I basically have to do it the old school way through my phone controls -- a dangerous disappointment!  Again RAM, I spent a serious amount of money on this product only to be disappointed.  Do something about this or refund me the cost of this useless system in my truck!  (Update as of 10/27/16 -- Since my initial submission of this review I have learned that the Pandora app will not work on the UConnect system as a technology company that supports the relationship between UConnect and Pandora backed out of their contract.  FCA dealers were made aware of this in May 2016, however I was not informed as a consumer eagerly looking forward to having this feature.  This is unfair and deceptive and I should have been informed of this prior to my agreement to purchase my truck!  In all likelihood it would have stopped the deal.  Shame on you RAM!)

Other issues:
1)  I join with other reviewers that have complained about the knob shifter -- I hate it!   However, it seems with electronic shifting most automakers are moving to knobs and push buttons.  I really miss my console shifter on my 2012 truck; and
2)  RAM should also have an easy down tailgate and crash avoidance systems to put the Limited on par with the competition.

I hope I come to terms with these issues and disappointments in light of the price tag - or I face some serious buyer's remorse.  Only time will tell how well I really like this truck overall.

ram,1500,2016,Mike B, 12/04/2016,Can't Change my mind,5,"Big horn ecodiesel 4x4 crew cab is the way to go. Just took it on a 2200 mile drive through mountains, snow, rain, wind storms, and thanksgiving traffic coming back from our round trip from Orange County to Vail Colorado and back through Vegas. Had 6 hours of bumper to bumper traffic from vegas home but still pulled off a 27mpg adverage in a 4x4 crew with 4 people a cab high shell and 5-600 lbs of gear. Elevations over 8000 ft and 11-15 deg nights Didn't slow us down. I was concerned with the Uria tank/ lines freezing, but got lucky, and didn't have thaw it out with the Colman stove... lol. Also purchased this truck for under 36k. It pays to look online for 30+ days on autotrader New/ lowest price/ any distance. Shipping was 1200, but hey I saved over 15k. Only issue with the accessories was the cruse control. As most have found out the on/ off Cruse button works randomly. Spank the back of the steering wheel and it will eventually come back. Love this truck ran it at speed limit + 4mph most all the trip w/ 18 starts and stops and 4 small side trips in Vail. Only needed the 4x4 once and most of the time ran in the light snow in 4x2 as the leader in our convoy. This truck is very stable and rides like on a cloud. Ford is rough, loud and can't compete on mileage. Chevy doesn't do it for me. Still has the same issues that they haven't resolved for nearly 20 years. I.E. Burt out running lights, tailgate latch. This is cosmetic, but really solve your build quality issues.
At 3000 miles,
I did a minor upgrade to the truck. Trimmed a little fat off of the burn cycle and am now getting 30+ MPG AND RUNNING CLEANER. drove from the center of orange county to Mesa AZ.  Side trip and back and averaged 30.8 for the tank after running around at home for 2 more days. The fuel computer still reads accurate and truck seems to have slightly more power and torque.
I know now how to get max mileage. I can get 33-35 highway at 62mph. The best mileage is after 15 miles of driving when the Trans and engine are at operating temp. Rock on Ram Trucks!

ram,1500,2016,matz, 11/21/2016,Poor Quality,2,"Purchased new 2016 Ram Laramie in April.  It has been in the shop for about 6 weeks total since purchased. The dealership has replaced 3 cylinder heads due to faulty parts used in manufacturing.  Fiat Chrysler basically said that this is my fault because I must be towing above the towing capacity of the truck.  The truck has only towed 3 or 4 times and the most it towed was about about 2,000 pounds.  The truck towing capacity is 9,200, so definitely not from towing, just poor quality.

ram,1500,2016,Ronnie, 12/15/2016,Made Big Mistake getting this P.O.S.,1,"Got my truck July 18, 2016, everything was great, love the ride of this truck. Fast forward to December, transmission begins to shift funny from 1st to 2nd gear. Took it into my dealer, they said was more than likely a software glitch, and flashing it would fix problem, called next day was told it didnt work and they were going to try to relearn it (whatever that means) Next day was told that didnt fix it either, and it needed a new transmission ( 3412 miles ) Asked for rental for second time was told to contact customer care, was told they don't provide rentals for warranty repair, back to dealer next day, after a nice argument with service dept I was again denied a rental, so took my complaint to showroom floor, and was finally put in a rental car. Now after having my truck for nearly 2 weeks, no work has even begun on my truck. Beyond irritated, Chrysler apparently could care less about customers, cant wait to get it back so I can begin looking to trade it in........ Lesson learned, LAST CHRYSLER PRODUCT I WILL EVER PURCHASE.....

This truck is 5.7 V8 express quad cab.  I could not find the box to check it. If it looks great and give an excellent ride? It is grea truck!

Everything else about the truck is fantastic. It is the best ruck I ever owned.

Oh and the Alpine sound system upgrade is totally worth the extra $300. It a must have if you listen to music in the car.

ram,1500,2016,Jose Cantu, 10/28/2016,LOVE MY TRUCK,5,"Got this three months ago and already have 6,000 miles. The shift does suck, I think a knob is no fit for a truck and Dodge needs to bring back the Colum shifter. I work for Toyota building the Tundra's and Tocoma's and this is the truck I would rather drive. For the price, I could but two Ram 1500's for the price of 1 Tundra. My truck has the V6 but the pickup power is unbelievable. Drives smooth and has lots of power. After the first month my mother went and got one for her self. We are a Dodge family!

ram,1500,2016,Michael P, 12/20/2017,Absolutely Love It!,5,"I leased a Big Horn Crew Cab with the standard bed and the 5.7L HEMI about a year ago now. I was comparing similar trucks (4dr crew, standard bed, big engine) with the features I wanted (big touch screen, remote start, cold weather package with heated seats and wheel). I drove a Silverado (worst one by far, terrible ride quality and cheap interior), a Tundra (nice but a terrible lease program) and an F150 (same as the Tundra; loved it, but when we got to numbers, it would've made more sense to purchase the vehicle because it was $200 cheaper per month!). I'd heard mixed things about Rams, simply because Chryslers don't have the greatest rep. Well, I think the Big Horn alone could change one's mind. It's the absolute best bang for your buck. Plenty of great features (a nice big screen, remote start, parking sensors, huge backup camera) for easily the best lease I have ever seen. I'm paying barely $400 with nothing down except my trade. For what this truck has and what it can do, that's astounding. I'm doing a 3 year lease, and I will without a doubt be returning to Ram for another one when this lease ends! The only thing that is questionable is the 8 speed transmission. The transmission itself is flawless, extremely smooth shifts and I think it helps with the ride quality. But the rotary dial throws me off a bit. Luckily, it was easy to get used to after a few months. Don't let something tiny like that get in the way of an amazing truck for the BEST price (yes, the BEST) on the market. Ram has earned the business of me and my friends for years. Amazing quality! Ram hit it out of the park!

ram,1500,2016,Mike C., 05/09/2016,"First truck owned, very happy with the change",5,"I've always been a car guy but I live in a huge city with crappy roads and even worse drivers and a mediocre public transit system. Sitting up high with a suspension that can handle mute the cracks and bumps is really nice. I like sitting up high and i'm impressed by the outward visibility in my truck even versus my '08 Altima (which also was very good). The fuel economy is less than advertised but still ok for a full-sized truck. I will probably upgrade the intake and exhaust system after a year or so, just to see what difference it makes. The interior is impressive and the infotainment system (UConnect) is really cool, very intuitive to use. The only things I didn't get that I wanted were keyless ignition (I had that on my 8-yr old Altima) and blind spot monitors. Other than that I'm really happy with my purchase and got a great deal on the Lone Star package (almost $10k under MSRP).

ram,1500,2016,stickfigure, 04/30/2016,4th Dodge truck - Still like them,5,"I am on my 4th Dodge Ram and they just keep getting better.  
The outside appearance has not changed much from my 2010 model, but the inside instrumentation is quite different and improved.  

The 5.7L V8 is significantly more powerful, but mileage appears to be slightly better than what I got in the smaller 4.7L V8 on my 2010.

ram,1500,2016,MOAMark, 11/30/2016,Poor engineering,3,"I can't believe Ram engineers haven't fixed the rear brake line clearance problem. S class chains are recommended for the rear but even S class cables came down within 1/4 inch of the brake line when I tried a set of Z cables. Wake up Ram. I did get standard chains in a narrower width that don't wrap so far down the sidewalls but a simple change of the angle the brake lines leave the rear calipers would seem to solve the problem. Did the bailout put government engineers in charge at Ram. I just can't understand why real truck engineers would not design a truck to take standard style chains.
Update; I still think the chain clearance issue is ridiculous. I am happy with the ride and comfort. 4WD and the anti spin diff seem to work fine. Plowed through about 18 inches of snow in the Yosemite campground not thinking about the front air dam but it survived just fine (snow was soft). Best MPG so far 21.6 by dividing gallons into miles. The computer shows about 2 mpg better than what I actually get. Most highway trips with mixed terrain I'm getting right at 20 MPG, mixed highway city gives about 17 MPG. I think on a maxi mileage test, flat road 55-60 mph it might go 23-24 mpg. The 21.6 mpg tank full was running 65-70 on hwy 395 from Death Valley (-200 feet) to Gardnerville ( 4000 ft) with Nevada gas, not the excuse for fuel we get in California.

Regular cabs are not common in my area and I had to look about 60 miles North to find this truck which was equipped just the way I wanted with Chrome bumpers, spray in bedliner, backup camera, and the 5.0 radio upgrade. All this for under 25k.  This truck in Granite metallic has the 6cyl engine which provides a lot of power but has a HWY mileage rating at 25mpg.  I am keeping this one folks its a great buy and the ride is much better than the 2015 Ford F150 XLT I sold which paid for my brand new Ram. Very quiet cabin with muscular looks on the outside.  If you can get a better deal than this go for it.  As of 8/2018 I have had no issues with the truck however there is an outstanding recall . My local dealer will be fixing this issue within 2 weeks.

The 5.7 Hemi just pulled like a beast all the way to redline and it was less money  so I got the V8 and am so glad I did as this 5.7 is just a great engine I just hit 40k and ii has only been to the dealer on the day I purchased it as I do all my own oil changes it only takes 15 min why would  anyone drive over to them and wait at least 30 min.

Terrible wind noise at freeway speeds. Very annoying!            Voice txt option never works!            Gas mileage is terrible...16.2 on freeway and overall is 13.5.

ram,1500,2016,NJTruckGirl, 08/07/2016,Jersey Truck Girl likes the Ram Limited,4,"Just got the Ram Longhorn Limited v8 Hemi with air suspension and all the bells and whistles. I'm a female owner who enjoys driving pick-ups and large SUVs, and looking really cool in them! So I decided to buy this truck, because I got a good deal on it. The rebates/incentives were great and the dealership wanted to move these trucks off their lot. So, instead of buying another SUV or truck, I decided I'll go with the Ram Limited.<br><u>What I love:</u> It has way more features than I could afford in any other comparable vehicle at that price point. It is luxurious inside. I love the technology -- front and back sensors, back up camera, air suspension, navigation, the touch screen system that controls everything is pretty much the best I have ever used. I also love the rotary shifter, power adjustable pedals, heated and cooled seats, push-button start. The detailing, stitching etc inside is simply awesome. The ride is relatively smooth and it handles awful potholed roads quite well.<br><u>What's missing:</u>  Daytime running lights! Why can't they put in some cool-looking LED DRLs on a $57,390 MSRP vehicle? Also, missing is a front camera, capless fuel door, xenon headlights, and a soft opening/closing power tailgate that a woman can easily use. It does need more sound insulation, because the wind noise does get into the cabin. The fit and finish needs to be improved, especially with rubber seals and other exterior trim. The truck is a gas guzzler, that's no surprise, but they need to do what Ford did and go aluminium.

ram,1500,2016,Fritz, 03/02/2016,My RAM 1500 diesel,5,"This is a wonderful truck.  Improvements in the entry area could be made for the taller person, I am 6'2"".  The height of the door could be 2 inches higher to accommodate this.  On the same token the seats could be an inch or so deeper for the same reason.  This truck drives and rides amazing.  The engine is quiet and responsive as is the steering.  I have not had the vehicle long enough for any repairs and it has not been back to the dealer in the first 6 weeks for any issues. 

3/3/2017: My previous evaluation is still the same.  I have noticed a couple of issues that could be changed.  The sensors that identify your distance to a close object SHOULD have different sounds for the back or the front.  The same alert does not help if you are not sure, such as when you are backing into a parking spot (parallel park).  I would also like to see the dash instrumentation that has the stored messages could have a dual purpose.  That being that the warning lights that come on, only a couple of times, could display what the warning is about.  That would tell you if you need to park the vehicle because of a serious problem.  Fumbling through the  manual is a painstaking process.  In addition, a separate section in the manual regarding ALL of the warning lights and their meaning would be a terrific aid.  A larger fuel tank would be a great option.  When you tow the mileage drops about 10 miles to the gallon and you are stopping every 90 minutes to fuel up.  The current mileage is 31,000 miles and we are averaging 25.4 mpg.  As you can see, we like driving it and I would not trade it for anything on the road now.

It takes them about 3 min to steal them. They break out the rear side windows, because it will not set the alarm off. Then they jump in and pry the system out, damaging the dash.

Travel Trailer with this truck (the reason we leased it).   The lease expires next week and I am leasing another one.  This truck is a comfortable, civilized, dependable mule.  We live in Northern Michigan where we typically get 120 inches of snow.  The 4x4 Auto setting is wonderful.  Towing at 65 mph, I typically get 10 mpg, about normal for a rig this size.  The difference is in towing through mountains.  With the standard 3.21 axle ratio, I have no problem maintaining speed.   We read so much about Toyota and Nissan trucks.  This Ram has been rock solid dependable, comfortable and capable.

ram,1500,2016,Big Dave, 12/24/2019,One heck of a truck!!!!,5,I was looking for a newer truck I think I drove everything known to man except the ram. I’m that guy that always says Chrysler’s are junk. A dealer said to me “do me a favor and take this truck for a ride” which was a 2018 ram big horn. I was extremely impressed with the truck which every other make I wasn’t. So once I left there I wanted to see what people said about the ram. I really couldn’t find anything bad. The truck I drove I would’ve bought but it had a bunch of hail damage. I found a 2016 bighorn with the 5.7 hemi. I absolutely love this truck and I plan on having this truck for a long time. I’ve had it now for about 2 months and I seem to love it more everyday. Talk about power this thing moves. I bought a tractor and pulled it home. I have a 20ft dovetail trailer and the tractor is way too heavy for it. That truck pulled it home like it wasn’t even there. I’m extremely impressed with this thing. One day I will write another review when I hit 250k right now it’s close to 60k

ram,1500,2016,James Brown, 10/12/2017,Holding my breath on diesel emissions scandal,4,"Edmunds review template did not give me the option of indicating my 2016 Ram 1500 4x4 crew cab Laramie has the 3.0 liter EcoDiesel.  I am very concerned that like Volkswagen, the Fiat-Chrysler engineers may have installed cheat devises or software settings that illegally inflate the performance specs of my truck.  The outcome of the EPA/CARB investigation is not known at the time of this writing.  If through some miracle the truck is able to get a pass on this and keep the current performance, I will remain a very happy owner.  This truck is great in most every way.  I pull three different trailers regularly:  My 25' travel trailer, a 2 ton hydraulic dump trailer, and a furniture moving trailer.  The 6 cylinder diesel gets the job done with ease and the 8 speed tranny works flawlessly.  We just returned from a 3000 mile traveling camping trip pulling our 6000 pound travel trailer and averaged 16 mpg (calculated by doing the math at the pump, not by reading the electronic dash display).  My wife and I have done two long-distance trips of over 400 miles each way NOT towing and the average was 28 mpg.  Two irksome flaws:  1)  Shame on Fiat-Chrysler for going cheap by placing the electronic down/up shift buttons on the right spoke of the steering wheel.  Fingertip paddles on the back of the wheel would be so much better, especially when downshifting going down grades while towing.  2)  Why are advanced safety features such as blind spot monitoring, automatic braking and lane departure monitoring not available (they are not available on any trim level at any price!)??  When a person decides to spend nearly $60,000 on a high trim level truck, such features should be available.

ram,1500,2016,TB, 07/27/2016,6 Mo Update,3,"After owning this truck for 6 mo. I have learned even more, but my comparison is based on my 2006 Nissan Titan and previous F-150.  The comfort of this truck is excellent the cab is quiet but I think RAM could do even better.  Acceleration is also excellent in fact on dirt roads it is so good it is hard to keep traction. Fuel economy is good about 14-16 combined at 80 mph, just wish the big 3 would do better, and the warranty is ok but I think they could also do better like the new Nissan or better yet offer a warranty like Hyundai 100k and 10 years, their sales would sky rocket.  Now for the not so good.  Working with the dealership is so difficult, never had a problem working with a dealership like I do with RAM,  my front parking sensor went out and the dealer charged me to have it fixed, they said it was a natural cause not mechanical. The lights flicker at night, the dealer said they did a firmware updated but it still does it, and now the cruise control will not activate sometimes.  The fog lamps bounce at night this is because of the poor way they are mounted.  I drive on a lot if dirt roads and the dust in the cabin is ridiculous.  I later found out there is no cabin filter, how cheap.  I found a kit on-line, installed it and it helped but still a lot of dust, this truck is advertised to be the do all truck but if you live in an agriculture area which is hard not to, it will be a big issue.  In fact I may not purchase another RAM because if this issue, very hard driving down the road with a lot of dust in the cabin and kids having problems breathing.  My Nissan and F-150 never had this issue.   Looking for another truck and will have to consider all brands since this one does wow me yet.   
--
I am also a 2006 Nissan Titan owner and I will have to say that back in 2006 there were more luxury options than on trucks today.  here are the things I had to but for the Ram that the Titan came stock with: MUD FLAPS, SPRAYED BED LINER, ADJUSTABLE TIE-DOWNS IN THE BED, BUILT IN TOOL BOX, SLOW OPENING TAIL GATE, NERF BARS, HEAVY DUTY FLOOR MATS.  These are things trucks should come with from the factory.  On the interior the Titan also blows the Ram away with toys from 10 years ago that should still be on todays trucks.  The ride on the Ram is very nice but they put car tires on them to give a quiet and smooth ride and by the way the tires only last about 13K miles.  I do not use the bluetooth because there is no option to use my headset or speaker phone in the truck, don't understand why car manufactures are not smart enough to create this feature,  who wants speaker phone on their private calls when there are other people in the vehicle.    The Ram has great power and tows good, overall I am happy so far with it but very disappointed in the way they make it look good.  If a person never owned a truck and purchased one today they wouldn't know what they are missing, but i do.

ram,1500,2016,Johnny Cash, 05/18/2016,Johnny Cash black on black 4WD Sport,4,"I've had the truck for a month or so & love it -- great power and acceleration, good fuel economy, plus a comfortable ride -- all at a good price. 

I added a spray in bed liner, a tonneau roll cover, fender flares, and custom fit floor mats, all from third party vendors. I also had the oem electric trailer brake installed by the dealer, but haven't towed anything yet.

The only critical feedback I have is relatively minor -- the AC required work prior to accepting the truck; a couple scratches on the passenger side door also had to be repaired.  These items could suggest that the dealer needs to step up their pre sale inspection process.

The shift knob on the dash gives more space on the counsel which is great.  However, I find the steering wheel upshift/downshift shift control cumbersome.  For example, to down shift you push a button on the front of the steering wheel -- given the other steering wheel controls I find myself hunting for that button.  (Other vehicles put the steering wheel shift controller behind the wheel as paddles which I find much more intuitive.)

I want to install a grill guard / winch system but the Sport model bumper interferes with the after market grill guards I've been looking at.  So if that's important to you, consider getting one of the other trim lines that has tow hooks on it.

Overall, I'm very pleased and would buy the truck again.

ram,1500,2016,Eric, 11/26/2016,Nice Truck,5,"I'm still getting used to it.  I was hoping for slightly better gas mileage, but can't complain too much about it.  I got the 3.21 gears as I won't be towing much and wanted the better gas mileage that it offers.  It has decent acceleration, but if you want better acceleration go with the 3.9 gears.  It suits my needs.  As with any vehicle, the dealership navigation system is not as good as google maps, which is frustrating.  The voice recognition system sucks.  There should be an option for a passenger to input an address while driving.  As far as driving goes, it handles well.  The seats are comfortable.  I really wish that the truck had a telescopic steering wheel.  I picked this truck over Ford or Chevy because of the price.  I pulled a 5700lb trailer 3200miles and had no issues.  It pulled much better than I had expected with an avg of 9-10 mpg @65mph.  It pulled fine at 75mph, but gas mileage fell to 6-8mpg.  It pulled the trailer through the hills of CO without problem.  I would recommend this truck to someone else.

ram,1500,2016,Texan, 12/02/2016,Proud Texan,5,"This is the 2nd RAM 1500 I've owned, (2009 Quad Cab, SLT, 4.7L-V8, 2WD;  2016 Crew Cab, Lone Star, 5.7L-V8, 2WD).  I decided to stick with the RAM for the ride quality, quietness, features for the money, and Hemi V8 performance.  I have about 3,000 miles on it and I'm getting 2+ more MPG on the same commuter route, (as long as drive normal).  However, i don't hesitate to pass because the acceleration is much better than my old 2009.  I haven't taken on a real highway trip yet but 2014 loaner with the same power train setup delivered 23.2 MPG on an 1,000+ miles round trip, (at 70-75mph, with AC, in Texas).  I fully expect this Hemi V8 will get the same MPG. . . . . UPDATE:  I've owned my 2016 Ram 1500 for over 2 years so I have about 17,000 miles of driving experiences to summarize.  The max I've towed is about 6,000 lbs plus 1500 lbs in the bed & there was always plenty acceleration available (in TOW/HAUL mode, with the 3.21 gear axle).  Without a load, acceleration is very peppy in TOW/HAUL mode which I often use on the city freeways.  Fuel economy is about what I expected (as indicated above).  I get about 19 mpg on a mostly freeway commute, 16 mpg around town, & 23 mpg hwy.  The vehicle is completely reliable, only recall updates.  I've driven the 2019 Ram 1500 Laramie and it is more plush. . . UPDATE (Dec. 2019):  miles 28,500, mpg hwy 21-24, no maintenance issues, better (Michelin) tires.  Plan to keep it at least 3-more years.  Still a great & comfortable hauler..  . . . . No real changes regarding performance & MPG above-mentioned.  Issues encountered: backup camera replacement & software update for Uconnect.  I'm still have an extended warranty.  If I replace this truck (after the warranty), it'll be the hybrid or the diesel.

I bought mine at half sticker not fully optioned but all the electric necessities. Less glitz more go with the eight speed. Hemi has great reliability. 80,000 trouble free miles on my 2012 and got 78% of purchase price of 2012. Both of my Rammies (5.7)had slow throttle response fixed by Pedal Commander($300). Ram only opens the throttle 80% at full throttle at the pedal. Pedal Commander allows fully open quicker and completely. 0-60 down from 7.5 to 5.9 ( per accelerometer, like many road test magazines use) 8 speeds help as well (2012 was only 6). Quarter mile down by 1 second and 45 to 80 in 3.1 seconds for the 2016. Ride is great, many highway miles quiet  and smooth with 21 mpg. Comfortable seats and room with a view. Great truck and no problems.  My brothers Jimmie has good power but lots of little problems without the ride. Now 2/2018. Still greater mileage at 20,000+miles. 23.5 to Fort worth and back!  Just added HHO (hydrogen from water system) 1mpg increase for now very smooth in 4cyldr mode(econ) used to rumble a lot.

Great hemi power, nice sound system and nav, fairly decent interior. But having a ""knob"" to shift with is simply ridiculous. I understand all transmissions these days are electronic, but a knob is just taking it too far. Same reason I'll never buy a Mercedes with their ""e-shift"". You took a console shifter and replaced it with a cheesy, flimsy stalk on the steering wheel? Even their sportier models they seem to be proud of their ""e-shift"". Sorry, they both lost my business. It's not a video game, it a car/truck. Bring back the console shifter please!!

ram,1500,2016,Jake Reyna, 04/12/2016,"Flawed tow and mileage, rear axle ratio",4,"Currently own a '07 Tundra, 5.7L, and am looking to replace.  Tundra's come with a 4.30 rear axle, meant for towing, so it has lower fuel mileage. Looking at all other trucks, Ram, Ford, GMC, they come with a 3.21+/- or 3.55+/- rear axle, better mileage, but do offer an optional 3.9+/- ratio for towing heavy.
I like the Ram, nice ride, but am hard pressed to find the 5.7L or EcoDiesel with the 3.92 ratio. So, I'm still leaning toward another Tundra, it has a nice ride, that's why we bought it in '07. All these other trucks have great specs, but it's not an apple to apple comparison. Tundra's are built to tow, and probably get the same mileage as any other truck with a similar rear axle.
If you're buying a truck to tow, make sure you do the math, the dealer is going to sell you what they have, not what you need.

(96 Tahoe, 2003 Yukon XL Denali, 2008 Yukon Denali XL, 2010 Yukon Denali, 2016 Cadillac Escalade).  My wife drives the Escalade but wanted something I could drive around town.  I work from home and do not put on a lot of miles.  I am tall 6,8 240LBS and needed something I could step into.  I began shopping for trucks that had great lease deals to get the 2016's off the lot.  Naturally I went to my local Chevrolet Dealer and test drove the 2016 Silverado.  The ride was extremely choppy and I felt every bump.  The acceleration was strong but not great.  Overall, I was more impressed with the 2007-2014 line up they offered which had a much better ride.  I went back to the drawing board.  Then I saw an add in the paper for a Big Horn 4X4 Crew Cab Hemi V8 for a low monthly lease payment so I went in for a test drive.  The ride was outstanding, acceleration was great and the sound through the dual exhaust was just enough growl for me.  My two kids (3 and 5 Boys) both fit comfortably in the back with room to spare.  Only about 140 miles into my lease but so glad to decided to try the Ram.

After spending over 3 hours on the phone with customer support and the Maps software people and trying several different recommendations like upgrading the software (which is supposed to be done automatically) they finally tell me that a dealership has to remove the software and reinstall it for it to work. I drop it off at Salerno/Duane in Summit NJ. After having it for 2 days they tell me there is nothing they can do. They don't remove software and the only thing they can do is replace the complete radio system and they are not authorized to do this. Even though I gave them a Case # provided by the Map people. I contact customer service again and have been going back and forth with them. They give you a # and an extension that does not work and  to call them  you have to listen to 10 minutes of sales pitches and then get disconnected or put on hold. You can't get a direct line to call or even an e-mail for immediate contact. Worst customer service for a very expensive truck. Can't wait to sell this one and get a Ford or GMC. Don't by RAM!

ram,1500,2016,Stuart Clark, 08/28/2016,Great so far!,5,"I love this truck so far. I rated the rain/snow traction and maintenance just on expectations. I know this Rebel 4x4 with the tires it comes with should have no trouble. The ride is great and the power is excellent. Great comfort, space, and interior controls. Love the looks of the truck and with the power it has, I should have no trouble pulling anything even though I haven't yet. The mileage is not on the upper end of the ratings, but that's partly due to the roads I drive on - lots of hills. This can be minimized by driving smart (55-60 mph).
Update: this truck does well on snow and ice, no issues. Still haven't driven in deep snow yet. Had the battery go bad which was a bit surprising, but that can happen anytime even with the best brand batteries.
Update 2020: had a couple of issues that need fixing - fuel sensor and the backup camera. But still love the truck.

The V6 seems to have plenty of power and you don't even feel it shifting. Getting in and out is pretty easy and the ride-and-drive is very comfortable. It rides like a car and it's very quiet inside. You will want to get running boards to make it easier to get in and out. Hopefully it will hold up in the long run, but so far it seems to be good.

ram,1500,2017,Ray's Hemi, 06/12/2018,Lover of chrome,5,"Went shopping for a new pickup truck and drove the F150 and Silverado along with the 1500 and although I went expecting to purchase a F150 I was impressed with the ride and power of the Hemi in the Ram 1500.  The build quality of the Ram is outstanding and the interior materials and layout really caught my eye.  The 5.7L Hemi engine is simply awesome.  The truck never feels like it struggles at any power range and the MPG is amazingly good and exceeded by expectations.  I chose the Laramie model because the big chrome grill and chrome bumpers jumped out at me and the rest Is history.  Extremely satisfied with the 1500 and although the Ford and Chevrolet were both quality trucks I'm glad I chose the Ram.

Now that i’ve Had my Ram 1500 for a year I can report that I’ve had no issues with the truck after 22,000 miles. This truck is a joy to drive and is everything I had hoped it would be. The 5.7 liter Hemi engine is a truly amazing engine and makes driving my truck an absolute joy.

Updating my 2017 Laramie-After 33K miles the truck has been flawless with no issues since purchase. Made a few performance enhancements which the Hemi engine loves and it performs better now. I really enjoy my 1500 Laramie and look forward to driving it every time I get in it.  Another update to the Laramie after 6 more months of ownership and I must say that it is a solid truck that is very satisfying to drive. No issues whatsoever and I’m very pleased.

ram,1500,2017,Rod Naples / Maine, 03/02/2019,Rams keep on trucking,5,"Bought this truck two years ago it’s the second Ram I’ve owned the first one I had I owned for 16 years . I must say they have come a long way . The 17 is a beautiful truck I have the Laramie 4x4 it’s a great truck I have the hemi motor and still get around 22 mpg on the highway thanks to the 8 speed transmission . It’s ride is unreal for a truck I test drove other makes and they didn’t compare to the ride you get in a Ram . It also is a pleasure to drive and handles great . I have The ventilated seats the heat and cool work great . I also have the alpine stereo system while it is not as good as Bose it does sound great . I also have the LED lights in the bed makes it easy to see things in the bed at night I did buy a tailgate assist on eBay so my tailgate now lowers itself slowly . I also have the Pearl White paint I would always pay for the paint upgrade it just feels like a better finish . I also bought the lifetime warranty it’s expensive but felt it was worth it because when my truck needs repair it will take the sting out of it . There’s also plenty of leg room front and back . The only thing I don’t like about the truck is the rotary dial shifter just doesn’t belong in a truck it takes away from the other finishes in the truck . I will say you also get more truck for your money then Chevy and ford if I bought one of there trucks it would of been 5-10k more . So keep up the good work Dodge -Ram would definitely buy one again I hope this was a helpful review . Have now owned almost 3 years still feel the same way about the truck still no issues I did have rear view camera replaced under warranty . Great truck don’t think other brands compare . Make sure you look at dodge before you buy another brand .

ram,1500,2017,Chris Percha, 05/24/2017,5.7 Hemi VS 3.6 Pentastar (I've owned both),4,"I recently purchased a 2017 Ram 1500 Tradesman quad cab 4x4 with the 3.6 Pentastar V6, 8 speed automatic, and 3.55 limited slip rear. My prior vehicle was a 2014 Ram 1500 Bighorn Crew Cab 4x4 with the 5.7 Hemi, 8 speed automatic and 3.92 limited slip rear. I loved my 2014 ram. I drove it for 90,000 miles with zero mechanical issues. I didn't even change the brakes or replace a single light bulb on it. Needless to say this experience made me a big fan of Ram Trucks. I wanted something a little more economical this time, so I switched to the V6 and a more basic trim. The V6 has adequate power. I've even used it to tow a small trailer. So far I am getting 1.5 mpg more with the V6 and I no longer have to use the mid-grade fuel recommended for the Hemi. I am getting about 560 miles out of a tank of gas (upgraded 32 gallon tank). Next time I will definitely go back to the V8. The V6 is respectable,  but the difference in performance is definitely worth sacrificing the almost nonexistent fuel savings. The V6 and 8 speed automatic work seamlessly together. The trans never seems busy and the shifts are so smooth you may need to look at your RPMs to know when a shift has occurred. I opted for the cloth bench seats, which are very comfortable, even more comfortable than the cloth bucket seats in my 2014. I opted for the 5.0 stereo with the stock speakers which are actually pretty decent (better than GM's Bose upgrade). It does a great job of reading the 128 GB thumb drive i store my music on. My 2014 Ram had the Alpine sound system with navigation. The sound quality was great. I would highly recommend the Alpine upgrade if it's available in your trim level. The suspension is super smooth and absorbs the bumps on my heavily rutted dirt road with ease. I have found the same road to be pretty jarring in many other vehicles. The brakes are powerful and as mentioned above, have an exceptionally long life. I’ve been able to go through 18 inch deep snow in these trucks with confidence. Having the optional tow hooks is very handy for pulling people out of ditches in the winter or just yanking out stumps. I can't say enough good things about these trucks. As good as this truck is,  I've driven the redesigned 2019 model and it's significantly better. You should definitely drive one before you make your decision.

ram,1500,2017,James, 01/05/2017,Ram big horn,5,"Great truck. Looked at the silverados as a comparison but the price difference was insane. For a Silverado with less equipment than the big horn, chevy wanted almost 9k more. I'm sorry but even if chevy has better resale I doubt it's that high. If I wanted a comparable truck from chevy it was almost 15,000 more. I've heard of people saying ram isn't as reliable but I believe that's a myth seeing as how everyone I talk to about rams says they love it and have never had any problems. Because of the new ""knob shifter I opted for an extended warranty just in case"" . The truck rides great. It seemed more smooth then the chevy and just about as quiet inside the cab. The stock stereo has great sound and the engine noise is just the right amount not too loud but it makes its presence known. The cab is huge. Crew cab has more room then our old suv. My mpg gauge tells me I'm doing almost 20 mpg but the real word when I do the math it's closer to 18. Overall it's a great truck with great looks. Good engine. The hemi sounds awesome. One thing I've noticed is the small ft and finish stuff where ram falls short. Little things that don't hurt the truck but makes you think ""really...."" definitely recommend it though.

I love my Ram, why I add 4 star,? My only ''cons'' is the fuel economy in the city, The Fuel economy falls dramactly in the city (12-13mpg) I think If at least It give you 15 or 16, will be perfect. Cabin is quite , material are good! The info system and screen are very nice and easy to use. The ride is smooth with unloaded bed, so Its a good point. The acceleration and shift are smooth, you can feel the power of the acceleration. I hasn't towed nothing, so I can't give an opinion about that, Nethier about the realibility, I own the truck for 3 months(2500 miles, But I bougth the car with 11000 miles), but I did two small road trips, with no problems, good fuel economy in the HWY using cruise control (22-23 mpg) at 60 mph.  I tested the Silverado before buy my RAM, I hd the idea that to choose the silverado because last more than RAM, but I didnt want to pay 4000 More for a Silverado LT as I wanted. i gonna prove the realibilty of my RAM, so Im new and I don't have previous ideas of RAM! I thougth that the ram will be hard to park but It's easier than I thougth . I prefer park back I think its easier, the sensors and the huge back up camera help you to park. the distance between each axes is no a problem to park. For convinence I think the rear seats have to have a USB port or power plug.

Updating the review with 20000 miles: continue doing a great job, 0 issues.


***Update 1/8/19 28600 miles.... 0 problems, good engine, Im happy with RAM, I suggest do no buy a new model until next year, it's better to wait and let them to correct all the issue for the first year in a new model.
The only thing that I don't like is I had to go 3 times for recalls in the last 6 months,but anyway they already repaired it with 0 cost. It's a smooth ride and very good truck.
oil change each 9000 miles,using penzoil full synthetic as the manufacter recommends, I change myself the air cabin filter and the engine air filter to avoid pay the dealer, but I used good brands for that.

ram,1500,2017,Norm, 01/26/2018,Quality Standby,4,"I've owed many RAMs - the ride is and has always been luxurious, the vehicle dependable and the maintenance quite reasonable - the 2017 upholds the tradition.   Would have preferred the ""bench seat"" version to the center console since the bench seat has separate controls for driver and passenger and still has the storage.  The gas mileage is a definite downside.  The smaller engine is only marginally better (owned both) with bit of loss in performance so it's a toss up.  There's a few aggravating details.  There's no possible benefit to the tail gate top being shaped to direct water into the bed.  The knob shifter just plan s....s.  And call me old fashion, but the lack of a cd player puts me at the mercy of a radio jockey's selection or the ""high tech"" electronics that just don't seem to give easy self selection options once the music is stored there.

ram,1500,2017,Tarjac, 09/23/2019,Doesn't like to be cold,4,"The Ecodiesel is a great engine once it is completely warmed up, but cold it is pretty much a dog!  Mileage is its strongest point.  I just averaged 27.6 mpg on a 150 mile trip, and I get 22-24 mpg in daily driving, obviously not towing.  Cost of diesel fuel varies, but around here it is less than gas as often as it is more and overall it does save money over a similar power gas truck.  The engine is very smooth and powerful, but only after it reaches full operating temperature.  It can be scary until you learn to compensate for the 2-3 sec delay for power when the engine is cold.  Don't jump out in traffic!!  The delay completely goes away once it warms up.  I'm told the cold lack of power is a function of diesels in general, and of required EPA tuning and there is nothing that can be done about it.  It's really not bad once you drive it awhile and learn its not a hemi off the line.

I bought it new and got a great price - less than a similar truck with the gas V6, so this engine is not necessarily a ""premium"" cost item.  I have not had any mechanical issues in 30,000 miles so I am pretty happy!

ram,1500,2017,Nwash, 07/02/2018,Factory defects that they won't fix,3,"Beware of the electronics.   If they fail intermittently as in my case,  the dealer won't do anything until they see.  I've been in 4 times and they can't reproduce a problem and told me I'd have to pay a diagnostic fee for them to dig into it.  Worst customer support ever.

I finally tracked down issue myself.  The problem I was having was that sometimes if I hit a slight bump while accelerating or decelerating, the track  would skip (on bluetooth player), or the radio station would change.  There is a rotary encoder on the dash to switch tracks and tine the radio.   I found that if you touched it slightly it would skip to the next track,  no turning required.  There was a ""soft spot"" in the rotation where the detents weren't clicking.  After spinning it around a few times it started working properly.   Probably just debris that got in during assembly,  but what a pain in the butt to find and fix. I got zero help from the dealer or RAM on this one. 

They did at least fix the faulty gas gauge sensor, and tank pressure leaks that showed up after replacing the sensor.  Only took 4 tries to get it right.

ram,1500,2017,Richard Ray, 01/23/2019,Ram kicks you in the butt if you get too close,3,"You might ask yourself why such good rating and then poor rating.  We have been buying the dodge trucks for 15 yrs.  We are honest, have good credit, and my husband is a disabled veteran.  If you want a good truck that tows well and gets good gas mileage then buy the ram but do not depend on the Chrysler corporation to back its product if you should unfortunately buy a lemon.  due to my husbands failing health we added U connect , GPS, and kept the sirius.  We  felt this a good investment for traveling  due to distance of doctors.  The truck has now had 7 radios replaced, amp replaced, satelite antenna replaced, and a body control module replaced.  The u connect does not work and thru their tests have found out all of the radios had previous owners so we asked for a new radio with a big refusal.  The truck has now been in the shop and the engineers and technicians with dodge cannot fix it so we asked for a  replacement new truck.  This has been a nightmare.  We get assigned case managers that lie and close out our case stating the truck is fixed.  Also the front speakers are muffled.  We are so disappointed and feel if we are to get our truck fixed we will have to pay for an attorney.  Shame on chrysler for doing this and theyare the Ram that kicked us in the butt.

ram,1500,2017,Yellowdr, 08/11/2017,2017 Rebel Hemi 3 yr update,5,"The Rebel Is always the family favorite for longer drives.  This year no towing or road trips due to Pandemic.     Now Rebel is being used for more weekly driving, store supplies, and tailgate as a workbench for yard and maintenance work.  
 Ram Box system is a great option to keep personal items out of sight now that truck is used around town. 

 Tires are barely showing any wear.  No maintenance issues. Keeping synthetic oil the standard.   

The entry lowering system is great and used often to make entry and exit easier for everyone.  

The bed divider is still well worth the money and Very convenient!

MPG remains the same ....on backroads at 45-55 mph still nets  20-22 mpg however city/town travel or getting on the Hemi cuts MPG significantly to 14-16 mpg.  For those who appreciate the sound of an engine the 5.7 does not disappoint.   

The family enjoys the Ram as much as when purchased.

Smooth riding, quiet ride like a Caddy.  I only have had this truck for 2 weeks, I am so glad I went to Dodge, always was a Chevy fan sure changed my mind.  Gas mileage is low in town but you expect that in a full sized pickup, but the mileage on the freeway with cruise control on between 22 and 25 depending on the grade of the road and of course the speed you are traveling.  All in all it depends on your driving habits what you get, but if you are happy with the truck you get that's all that matters in the end.

In 2002 I purchased my first Ram it was 2500 with a Cummins engine, I must have owned 5 of them and I like them.  In 2013 I tried the Ram 5.7 Hemi and fell completely in love with it and have had another 3, one which I'm still driving.  Its a great ride, I'm very happy with the power and gas mileage, handling and looks. It pulls my 22' boat with no problem.  I can't say enough good about this truck.  All the trucks out there are good, pick the one you like, but based on my experience you can't go wrong with the Ram with the powerful, fuel efficient 5.7 Hemi."
ram,1500,2017,Calvin Mathis, 04/21/2017,Internet is your best tool,4,"The internet is your most valuable tool in searching for a new vehicle.  All the necessary information you need  in selecting the best vehicle for your needs at the best price is there and there are a lot of tips in how to deal with the buying process.   Once you narrowed down the make, model, and features you want, send an email to dealers internet manager and let them find your vehicle.  Avoid high pressure salesman by dealing only with the internet manager.  The finance manager is the most aggressive person you will have to deal with and you should verify everything they tell you.  If they tell you something that is different then what your internet research said, ask them to explain the difference and if they object, ask to talk to the general sales manager.  I used OneNote to document my research. Mostly happy with the truck after 1 year. Hate the black interior in Texas. Would rather use my Garmin for directions that Ram navigation (nothing great). Those are the only 2 things I would change on the truck if I could.

ram,1500,2017,Rod Appel, 07/25/2017,Still hooked on Ram.,5,"This is my third Ram. I've owned a 1996, a 2007, and now a 2017 and they just keep getting better. The Tradesman is a high quality, yet basic truck, with enough options available to dress it up at a reasonable price. And the 3.6L V6 is powerful while also being economical - it tows my 2000 pound ski boat with ease.

ram,1500,2017,David DeChambeau, 03/30/2018,Best truck out there,5,"This truck is amazingly comfortable.  Room for six adults to ride comfortably and plenty of room in the bed for gear.  V6 engine is powerful and economical.  Interior is excellent and ride comfort is fantastic.  The price of this truck beat the competition big time.

I recently bought a 2017 Ram 1500 express crew cab with the Pentastar V6 engine and I couldn't be happier.  Power is awesome and fuel economy is fantastic for such a large and powerful vehicle.  I previously owned a 2003 Ram 1500 with the 5.7 hemi and I never had a single problem with it so that was a huge factor in deciding to buy another Ram.  So far I have not been disappointed.  In my opinion the Ram is the nicest looking full size pickup out there.  Once I put an ARE topper on this truck it will be the perfect all around vehicle.  More room than an SUV with plenty of room for six adults to ride comfortably plus all that cargo space in the back.  The only other pickup I considered was the Ford F150 but the Ram blew it away in terms of pricing, towing capacity and fuel economy.  If you're looking to buy a new full size pickup, I highly recommend looking at RAM.

I've had this truck over a year and a half now and still could not be happier with my decision to buy another Ram.  We took it on a long trip with four adults and a dog, towing a trailer with kayaks, bikes and just about everything else you could need for a week in the Ozark mountains of Arkansas.  Beautiful ride, great fuel economy, and a great sound system made for a very enjoyable trip.

ram,1500,2017,Marc, 11/29/2017,Falling In Love Again,5,"For years I missed my 1999 Silverado extended cab 4x4 even though I went through a series of BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Acura and Infinity.  I had some great cars but living in North Texas with the traffic here, I always felt like a little guy amid giants. I would arrive white knuckled and tense.  Now, the ride is great, the leather very nice, the amenities are great and I feel relaxed and comfortable at the end of my drive.  Bonus is I can carry stuff and have a ridiculous amount of storage with the Ramboxes and tonneau cover. With the 4 corner air suspension, it has a great drive. I'm all over this thing. It was expensive, but it was worth it.

UPDATE: After two years of owning this truck nothing has changed. I love it. My only regret is that my garage won't hold it and I wind up bringing it in as far as I can and throw a moving blanket over the tailgate during severe storms. But that's it. I added a Pedal Commander as the only performance enhancer. It does help the ""lag"" you feel when pushing the accelerator and has several levels to choose from.  I've actually thought about upgrading next year to another Laramie-Longhorn but I am not sure I can part with this one!

ram,1500,2017,Cooper, 05/20/2017,"Quality control, paging quality control!",4,"I have had this truck for a month. I test drove it a couple of times. I switched up from an '03 GMC. There is a world of difference, and this Ram is in a different solar system then the old trucks, it rides better than most cars I've owned, lane changes are great, the V6 with the 8 speed is amazing, very road travel friendly! Seats are for a little skinnier person than I am, I'm a 6'1"" 260lb furniture mover, but aside from my issue of being wider than the seat by an inch, they cup and hold me in great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My complaints are the quality control, or lack thereof. There is a sandy substance UNDERNEATH the paint in the door jambs of the front passenger and driver side rear door, right where you see it every time you open the door. There is what may be a small fuzz ball stuck UNDER THE PAINT on the bed side. The ""cup"", which is the little plastic area behind the door handle, doesn't fit in the top correctly on the passenger side, I fiddled and fixed the front passenger door, but the rear door has a sold 1/4"" gap all across the top. STAY AT A COMPLETE STOP while changing gears, if you don't, the lights flash on the dash and on the rotor gear selector (which is in a terrible place, considering all I do is turn my fan speed up and down instead of getting into Drive or Park) until you stop again. Kind of annoying. While on the transmission, if you're not at a dead stop, the transmission feels like its fluttering a little while it's engaging from Park to Drive, but if you're on the brakes until it's engaged, you'll not notice.     The truck really is great, but the quality control must've been off the day this one was built, and the rotory knob is weird. The stereo however, is nothing short of amazing. If the window is half up(or down for you pessimists), they rattle with bass, and I've got the bass on 3, and the volume on 20. The thing rocks. Gas mileage has been between 22 and 22.6 on the highway, and pretty solid average of 13.8 in town, a little town, lots of stop and go, like every 300ft. Our city blocks are small.     Really like the display in the dash, kind of like the stereo display, but I got the little one, the bigger one may be better, but I'm pretty satisfied, aside of the fact I bought the cheapest one and it's still 40k, for that price, I'd prefer more quality.

ram,1500,2017,magick727, 03/11/2018,Feel Like I splurged without having splurged,5,"Apologies in advance for lengthy backdrop.  There might be a point....  Before purchasing a 36ft travel trailer several years back,   I had a F150 Harley 4.6.  It was beautiful truck. Impeccable interior, down to  the accent lighting, air-conditioned seats with trademarked dye with Harley monograms.   The retractable running boards were a nice touch when they worked.  And when they didn't the result was laughable.  There was nothing quick, or powerful about that 4.6L.   And the Harley AWD edition only had a GWVR of ~5.5k so it had to go when I got the trailer.  We also had an AWD Volvo 400hp XC90 at the time which put the ford to shame in terms of power and handling but nowhere near that tow capacity.   I eventually upgraded to the F250 Powerstroke KingRanch which was rated for 14,000 and would tow my 10k trailer up any hill I could find.   But, even with stock suspension and proper weight distribution, the back end sagged noticeably and caused people to  flash their high beams angrily in retaliation for my low beams assuming high beam vectors...  Still, it towed cross-country w/o issue until I discovered that SuperDuty trucks exceed the hight restrictions of many Pacific North West urban parking garages (Including my own residence and place of work) .  So I sold the F250 and recently bought my first 1500 Hemi.   It fits in the garages and I'm happy.  It also has that same aggressive power and handling as the xc90 while towing my weight class and NOT blinding oncoming traffic.  This 1500 Hemi 4x4 with 5k miles was 1/2 the price of Powerstrokes with 40,000 miles or more.  I did have to travel 3 states away to get a decent  deal, and decided to  pass on the higher end trim package while keeping all the tow essentials.  So far I don't miss anything and will have much less to cry about when the Hemi begins to accumulate typical ""cramped garage"" cosmetic wear and tear that  has worst impact on for trucks with higher end packages.

The Lone Star Silver Edition is loaded with just about every amenity that you would need. Just for grins I tried out a Ford model this year and was not impressed.   Because of the aluminum body vehicle drove more like a car. When I looked for something in the same price range as the Ram the dealer offered me a four cylinder turbo in a full-size truck. Really!     I priced an XLT model with the 5.0 V8 and their best price after rebates was $12,000 more than my RAM.  Staying with the Ram and the 5.7 L Hemi.

Like the high ride for the ability to see far - plus less fatiguing for long trips.  My only beef is the stereo.  Like all FCA products, it automatically turns on each time you start.  The only fix is to turn the volume all the way down rather than pushing the power button.  Also, it only reads USB drives up to 4 GB (FAT32).  It would not play my 64 or 128 GB NTFS-formatted USB drives.  Fords are better here.  Fuel economy display and other Driver Information Center functions are not intuitive (had to read the manual).  Gas mileage was as advertised.  Liked the outside door handles for the quad cab doors (Ford and GM require you to open the front doors to access the buried rear door handles).  Great looking exterior!  Under hood is an amusing sight with the 3.6 - about two feet of empty space between the radiator and engine.  Still, I'd take this over the Ford's amped-up 2.7 with that annoying start/stop feature.  Better to suffer slightly lower MPG than to feel annoyed most of the time.  I never considered a Chrysler product before, but the trucks seem to have better owner reviews than the Fords and GMs.  I'll probably end up buying one of these.  A better truck for less money.  I'll just buy and install a proper stereo from Crutchfield.

ram,1500,2017,alan mann, 11/19/2017,Traded the Challenger R/T Hemi for 1500 Hemi Quad,5,"Okay so we had a 2015 R/T Challenger Pearl Black/Red Leather Guts...loved it but wanted a truck that we could love the way we loved our Challenger. Being a Mopar man most of my life of course I got the Ram 1500 Quad Cab Hemi, 3.92 Limited Slip with trailer tow pkg and Nav with the Alpine system. Came with the bed liner which is the only thing I may take out and replace with the spray in liner. Believe it or not people told me when I had my Challenger I would never get more than 18mpg. (5.7, A-8). Well got an average of 22 over the 26000 miles we had it. Now with this Ram they are saying I will never see more than 15 mpg. Well wrong again. I am still in the process of breaking it in but I am averaging 19.2mpg. Yes we do live in the country and it is more rural with rolling hills, but still getting that on break in we'll take it. The ride in this compared to my friends GMC Z71 2017 he just bought is so much nicer it is ridiculous. He has the 5.3, 355 rear and you can tell the difference between the coil springs in the Ram vs the leaf in his. Comfort wise I'd say the Ram has a little bit of an edge as his seats are more contoured but not as comfy. I chose not to get the crew cab Ram for 2 reasons. $$ wise the crew cab came in 4k more and for the difference I could not see it. Heated seats and steering wheel and shorter bed. Yes the crew also had more room in the back, but seriously how many times do most of us carry people in the back unless you still got kids. The crew cab also did not have the rear window defroster, no Nav ( but Nav capable) and fold down arm rest in the rear and my arms don't go back that far. Basically $$ for $$ the Quad Cab Ram 1500 vs the Crew Cab was our choice. Now my buddy who got the GMC SLT Z71 spent 14k for that puppy and no way can anyone justify 14k for a 4x4 GMC vs Dodge. Heck even the Ram1500 4x4 Crew Cab set up like the GMC was still 4-5k less. So bottom line is dependability, comfort, style, and overall satisfaction all those GM and Ford boys ( especially Ford, aluminum bed really) can keep on dreaming and when they finally settle on getting a real pick up truck they can buy a Ram. Can ya guess by now that I am one happy camper.

This small cam-in-block Hemi engine is elegantly simple and compact, mechanically very quiet,  powerful and amazingly efficient too.  Am planning to upgrade the brake calipers to stiffer and more powerful units for better brake feel.  This 1500 is a keeper, with car like ride and quietness for long trips, and 4WD to keep the tow trucks away on dirt roads.

ram,1500,2017,PaulC, 12/27/2017,Car-like ride and decent seats,4,"For a 4x4, the RAM does a good job insulating occupants from the harshness of the road.  Road noise is pretty well suppressed as well.  Seats are larger and feel softer and better padded than the Ford F-150 or Toyota Tundra.  Engine and transmission feel responsive and refined. Of all the full size pickups I think the RAM 1500 is the most car-like and comfortable.

ram,1500,2017,James S., 05/30/2018,Rented Then Bought One - Love It!,5,"I had a prior review for a 2017 rental that was generally positive.  By chance I found a prior rental (2017) on craigslist with 12K miles and bought it.  Same exact color (red).  I love this thing!  The gas mileage averages over 20 with mostly town driving (better than my Cadillac).  It was easy to get the USB drive interface working.  Lucked out and got one with the upgraded gauge cluster (highly recommend).  The ride is very smooth and quiet - comparable to my Cadillac.  Love the height.  Voice command not that great, but the phone and USB interfaces more than compensate.  The V6 is more than adequate.  The only con is that it's a little tough to park and fit in the garage, but you have to expect that with a full-size truck.  Glad I bought the Quad Cab instead of the Crew with the long bed (now that's a battleship!).  The 5' 7"" bed normally found on the Crew Cabs is just too short.  Better to trade back seat space for bed space.  A very attractive and practical all-around vehicle.  Thinking of buying a Laramie and selling my other cars.  The radio that turns on every time you start is annoying but I just learned to turn the volume all the way down instead.  Test drove several V8 Laramies and didn't like the engine as much (plus MUCH worse mileage).  Almost impossible to find a V6 Laramie.  Owned it 7 months now - zero problems.  Still highly recommend.  My favorite vehicle out there.

Update after one year @ 23,000 miles:  Still no problems!  My favorite vehicle by far. Very comfortable seats and super smooth ride.  Paint looks as good as ever.  Upholstery still in excellent shape.  We live where it's muddy, so I bought rubber floor mats.  Highly recommend the V6 quad cab.

ram,1500,2017,Rick, 10/16/2018,Huge pleasant surprise!,5,"I replaced a 1998.5 Dodge Ram Xtra Cab (5.9 liter Cummins Diesel engine) with a new 2017 Ram Laramie Crew Cab 4X4 “long bed” with the 5.7 liter Hemi engine.  I had been towing a new 27 foot, 7K lb travel trailer (not fifth wheel) with the Cummins, and had real concerns about the Hemi being able to do the job.  I was assured by the dealer that I would have no problems, and aside from needing an airbag system for the rear of the 2017, towing has been a breeze. The Hemi with the eight-speed transmission is significantly smoother than the Cummins, and that goes all the way back to 2002 when my wife bought the Diesel. When not towing, this truck rides as nice as my wife’s Lexus and has both more interior room and a superior 9-speaker sound system. The reliability for the first 14 months has been near flawless. I would recommend this truck to anyone who needs a light-duty full-size pickup. I compared Ford, Chevy and Toyota and the clincher was the drivetrain of the Hemi. The Hemi V8 dual-exhaust system is a throwback to the 1960’s when trucks sounded more “manly”.

My latest 2017 RAM now has 55k (9/30/19) and I have had zero issues.  It's quiet, super comfortable, plenty of power (5.7L) and returns a solid 22mpg at 75mph all day long.  I used it to commute back on forth from Grand Rapids MI to Kenosha WI for a year in all kinds of weather.  Now we use it to chase my daughter's travel volleyball team around a four state area.  It is truly a ""do all"" vehicle from towing trailers, getting groceries, hauling lumber for remodeling and loading up for weekend volleyball tournaments.  It is equally competent for Friday night date nights and cruising the back roads so my dog can hang her head out the window.  Love, Love this truck.  I had my heart set on a new F150 in 2017, but Ford and Chevy just want way too much and rely on the diehard fans returning each year. RAMs are so good now and the pricing much cheaper than Ford or Chevy.  Want the best deal?  Buy a RAM 1500 Classic while they last.
*Update* just passed 82k miles with no issues.  I run Mobil 1 exclusively and oil sample at each oil change.  Everything is perfect, buy with confidence.

It was not covered under warranty because the plastic parts physically broke.  RAM USA determined it to be owner fault versus inadequate design stating the compartment on the door handle was not designed to be used as a handle.  My son's arm was not long enough to reach the handle and used what looks like a handle.  From their quick response it seems that this may be a common failure and response.  The local service department offered me a 25% discount to make me happy.  I now drive an expensive 2015 RAM Crew Cab truck that has a broken door because I can’t afford to repair the door multiple times due to plastic connectors the size of toothpicks.

ram,1500,2017,Bobby, 06/23/2019,Love my Ram,5,"I had searched for months, looking at F150, Chevy silverado, or Ram 1500, being retired, still own a 98 Dakota SLT with 3.9 cu. in.  And a 2016 Santa Fe Hyundai sport, which I purchased used, low miles, loved that car, no issues, towed a small trailer with it, as well as towing with my Dakota. I was heavily leaning toward the ford 150, with 5.0 engine, only because the turbocharged units reportedly having so many issues. Although I have always purchased used vehicles, 2-3 years old, low mileage, except for 2 news ones earlier in my life, saving money was my goal on my limited income. I always reviewed car fax reports, as they always gave you details, history of maintenance on the vehicle. After several months, I chose the Ram 1500 with 5.7 hemi. , trading in the Hyundai, loved that car, Only because I was looking for power to pull a trailer, comfort ride, and decent economy for a large truck. Although I wasn’t trilled with the Trans . Electronic shifter, I got used to it. Purchased with 39k miles, I purchased an extended warranty, simply because of the electronics, like any newer vehicle, this is a wise choice. After putting on 5500 miles, I love the truck, though I hate getting rid of my Dakota, it has been a good truck for me, but have to let go. I love the potential power, as you can feel it, waiting for you to unleash it at a moments notice, and sometimes you feel there is nothing behind you when towing. Great truck, I will be taking care of this one. The only disappointment is the mfr. wants $450 for the code to the 8.4 unconnected for navigation. I decided against it for now, and use my older  GPS. But the Sirius radio is a plus, miss the CD player, but most vehicles are getting rid of these. Well, I love the truck, and hope to enjoy for many years to come.

ram,1500,2018,Jason Kleiger , 02/17/2018,What a Truck!,5,"I have the short bed Laramie CC with the 5.7 V8 4x4. There was not an exact match for purposes of the review on Edmunds. This truck has the softest and quietest ride. It is unbelievable. Chrysler really thought of everything when putting together this truck.  This isn’t even the Limited, but I have not had one of those “awww man, I wish it had the _____.” Mine doesn’t have rambox or the air suspension, but I can’t imagine the suspension can be anymore smooth yet agile than it already is. As for the rambox, I’m sure it’s a nice feature, but there is plenty of space to store things securely inside, even in those little boxes built into the floor. This truck is smart - it knows the temperature enough to decide whether to turn on the heated seats/steering wheel, or turn on the ventilated seats. It also knows whether to turn on the defroster and the heated mirrors. Apple car play is amazing. So much easier than using the older Uconnect systems. Even something so passive as the wheel to wheel steps are brilliantly engineered. They’re at the perfect height to get in and out of the truck (without muddying up your pants). The design of the truck (although dated, and slated for a remodel for the MY 2019), is still gorgeous. I have the Delmonico Red, and the paint is amazing, and the truck still has that “tough” look. Call me gaudy, but I love all the chrome. 

The only knock on the truck is that sometimes the steering wheel controls have a spasm and won’t work. It usually corrects itself after turning off the car and coming back to the car a few minutes later.   If that’s my only complaint, this truck is simply amazing. Like another reviewer said, gas mileage sucks, but I didn’t buy this truck to get 30+ mpg. You’re better off with the diesel or the v6 for that. "

The Ram 1500 that I got is a little basic, not equipped with many Technology options.  It does have bluetooth, pretty nice sound system. With that exception, this is a great truck.

The ride is something that I just can't get over. There really isn't anything that I don't like about this truck. Ford and Chevy make nice trucks, but they don't ride near as smooth as the Ram.

ram,1500,2018,Rodriguez, 01/06/2019,The best daily driver truck - unless you're towing,4,"I was in the market for a daily driver truck and I found the 2018 RAM 1500 Laramie EcoDiesel (crewcab, 4x4, 3.92 rear) that did the job perfectly. In the 9k miles I've owned it, I was averaging close to 24mpg/city, 30mpg/highway, and 13+mpg/towing a 7k lbs travel trailer. As a daily driver, I don't think there is a better 1/2 ton truck with the mpg I was getting. The biggest flaw with this truck is the payload capacity. Being it's a EcoDiesel, the engine weighs more than the HEMI, therefore, reducing the payload. I only had 1005 lbs of payload capacity and with a tongue weight of 600 lbs, I was only left with 400 lbs of carrying capacity for my wife and kids. Therefore, I traded the truck in for a 3/4 ton truck to increase the payload. Granted, the towing capacity was 8640 lbs, which wasn't the problem, it was the cargo capacity. Other than that, this is the truck to get as a daily driver.

ram,1500,2018,Ken V, 03/30/2019,Not so Noob 1500 owner.,5,"Prior to this truck I had a 2005 Ram 1500 Quad Cab with the 4.7 L v8.   Truck was nice but the 4.7L could not pull hard when you needed it to.  I got the itch for a Charger and got the R/T with the Hemi.  Great car, had it for 10 years with no issues.  I got the itch again for a truck and got the Ram 1500 with Hemi and the 8 speed tranny.  Man what a great riding truck and the Hemi pulls like a freight train in stock form.  I can't imagine how it would pull if I tweaked the engine with a tuner , added exhaust and cold air intake.... I promised the wife I would leave it stock.. :)  Anyway, the new suspension is leaps and bounds smoother than the old rear leaf spring suspensions of the older Rams and what Ford and Chevy are using today.  I went with the Express package because I did not want all the electronics, which if there is a gremlin down the road can cost a pretty penny to fix, but I will say the Big Horn version is pretty nice.  The sound system is excellent and the lighting is adequate.  Crew cab is the way to go if you want enormous cabin space to keep full size adults in perfect comfort and the quiet cabin is a bonus.  The cabin does allow you to hear the sweet music the Hemi produces when you lay into the throttle.  Overall I absolutely love this truck and would recommend it to anyone.

UPDATE:  I have a little over 10,0000 miles on the RAM now and she runs like a dream.  No issues at all, shifts smooth and runs with power.  Only change I plan on making is to upgrade the shocks, the stock MOPAR shocks are a little soft for my taste and when I changed them on my last Ram, the ride was night and day.  I still would recommend this truck to anyone.

The only negative thing I have to comment on is that it is a gas guzzling hawg! But I knew you what I was getting into when I chose it! I was a Chevy man but Im sold on this Dodge Ram and am very serious about looking into buying one! It turns on a dime unlike the Fords that I drive for work! Good job Dodge. Interested in seeing the longevity of the engine and instrument panel.

For better fuel economy monitor driving habits and average mpg gauges to get optimum fuel economy.

ram,1500,2018,Kevin , 05/09/2020,Great Truck,5,I had been wanting a truck with a small diesel.  This is perfect. I get great mileage average around 22mpg. The truck is comfortable and has all the bells and whistles.
ram,1500,2018,Tyler, 08/13/2020,"34,000 Mile Review",5,"I bought the Laramie new, with the Hemi. Overall I would rate it a 4.5. I am not a brand loyal guy.  It has been in the shop for repair twice. Once for a tailgate latch recall and for the navigation not working correctly.  They had to replace the entire radio to fix that.  Thankfully it was under warranty.

The greatest thing about this truck is the comfort.  I am relaxed and enjoy the ride.  It feels great and driving down the road and with the totally adjustable seat and foot pedals you can dial it right in.  The heated seats are great.  The ventilated cooled seats are nice, but I doubt I would miss that on my next truck.

Maintenance has been minimal and I have done my own oil changes.  According to my truck computer it looks like I could reach 10,000 miles between oil changes, but I do them at 7,000.
Removing the filter is a little messy, due to the location.

The paint is nice with no issues that stand out.  I polish and correct as needed and never use car washes.  The black plastic on the door is nice, because when you close the door (from outside) you touch the plastic/covering not the paint.   I get compliments often on how the truck looks.

My favorite feature is the radio.  I've never had a really nice radio.   Keyless entry/start is fantastic. 

Auto 4wd had been great with no issues in snow or mud.  I have only locked it in 4wd a couple times pulling a trailer full of dirt up a hill that was muddy.  I never missed a beat.

Tires are going to need replaced around 40,000.  I kind of expected that coming from the manufacture.  I get 20mpg in the summer and 17mpg in the winter.  89 oct fuel being used.

As far as things I don't need or care for.  The mirrors don't fold in when there is ice/snow sometimes.  The sun roof never gets used. The tailgate needs to drop soft.  Lots of scratches above the tailgate handle due to the way it opens.   I really wish I would have got the extended cab vs the double cab.   I use the bed more than carry people around.  Lastly, this is a big truck.  When I go to stores and such I park way out for two reason, one so people do hit the truck opening their doors and two, to get myself in a position to just pull out of a space.

If I had to do it over again, I might go with the Big Horn with an extended cab, and no moon roof, to save some cash.  

I hope this helps you decide if this is the right truck for you.

ram,1500,2018,Anthony Reaves, 04/10/2019,My first Truck ever,4,"I have been buying cars since 1976.  I have never had a truck before, but after driving the work F-150 truck, I changed and got a Ram 1500.  The truck is nice, but it lacks standard options that my 2014 Honda CRV had, and less than my 2005 Cadillac SRX had.  No controls on steering, no tech for phone to stay connected with Bluetooth once engine is turned off.  No seat adjustments as mine are manual despite the vehicle costing over 33k.  My drive train is 2w drive only unless I am in the mud.  My Honda and Cadillac was 4wd all the time.  I did not get a bed liner or step rail which I had to buy off market.  However, I will never own another car, I will buy trucks forever, just next time I think I will go with my first mind and get a better equipped F-150 or GMC. I did get a great rebate down payment, so it makes it worth it.

ram,1500,2019,Steven, 09/14/2018,Disappointed long time Dodge/Ram owner.,3,"I have had several versions of the Dodge ram 1500 since it was redesigned in 2009.  They have all performed very well with high-quality interiors and technology. I was very excited when I bought my 2019  Ram Laramie  this past July.   Within two weeks of ownership, the  phone system stopped functioning properly and the audio quality sounded as though only one speaker was working. I have the Harman Kardon  Soundsystem which is wonderful. But in order to get the phone sound quality back to all speakers, you have to turn off the surroundsound manually for each call. That was the fix that Chrysler has so far. The new heavy duty brakes are squeaking like crazy. The incredibly smooth ZF transmission has intermittent clunking  when down shifting when coming to a stop.  The air conditioning is not as cold as my previous Ram 1500.  The final straw which prompted me to write this review, was when the truck stalled at a light yesterday. The truck is so quiet on the inside that I didn’t even know it stalled until all the alarms went off telling me to put the truck into park and restart it. When trying to contact Chrysler Corporation, I get an overseas call center with an agent but most likely has no idea what a truck is.  The  Chrysler dealership in  Palm Springs, CA has been very helpful but they are baffled at the truck’s issues and their arms are tied waiting for Chrysler to get the bugs worked out.   If I had known I was going to have all these troubles I would have kept my old truck. I believe Chrysler released this truck too early  without properly testing all if it’s systems. I will open an official complaint with Chrysler and will start the Lemon Law procedure If it’s not repaired within the legal amount of time it takes Chrysler to repair it. It takes a long time but the law does work ( used it with a defective Ford product years ago).   I will say, the truck is very quiet and very roomy. The interior is  incredibly comfortable compared to my previous truck. The ride quality is the best. That said, the technical issues outweigh the comfort. I would recommend not buying one of these trucks until after the bugs are worked out. Maybe a 2021 model.

ram,1500,2019,Brian Tepesch, 07/29/2019,Official Lemon by law and RAM says too bad!,1,"I had to take my brand new 2019 new style RAM 1500 into the shop 5 times within the first 2 months and 1500 miles due to the check engine light randomly coming on. They replaced many components including the entire engine. I was without the truck for over 30 days, so by law it is a lemon. I just want a replacement as this truck that has had a lot of work done to it is not, and never was, the truck I was sold. Best part, RAM says too bad, and for confidential reasons they will not replace it. Confidential... as in the loyalty of the company doesn't match the loyalty of this 3rd generation RAM owner who has owned numerous RAMs including this 3rd in a row new purchase??? Loyalty only lives on the consumer side these days, and RAM proved it with how they have responded to this situation.

ram,1500,2019,SY, 03/21/2019,Nice truck but questionable reliability,3,"I really liked the truck, took a test drive and had to have the truck.  Lot’s of great technology, 12” infotainment screen, unbelievable comfort and the 4 corner air suspension gives it an extremely smooth ride.  I’ve owned the truck just under a month and it has 568 miles.  I was headed to work early one morning and the truck lost power.  It coasted to a stop and once it stopped wouldn’t move again.  Called Chrysler’s roadside assistance and had to wait over 3 hours for the tow truck to arrive.  After sitting at the dealership for 3 days, I finally got a call letting me know the transmission failed.  The dealer is unsure about when they will receive the transmission but said hopefully it won’t take more than a week or two to get the truck back.  Really like the truck but I’m so disappointed about the transmission failure and am concerned I made a mistake with this truck purchase.
"
ram,1500,2019,Jeff, 05/03/2019,Don't Get Sucked in by the Looks and Comfort,3,"I can't in good conscience give this truck more than three stars due to reliability issues. Let me explain. The all new 2019 Ram 1500 is beautifully designed and engineered as long as you are wanting to spend $58,000 on a piece of yard art. I hope that you enjoy spending a lot of time at your local dealership where you purchased it because it will either be sitting in your yard or at the dealership. I purchased mine on 1/18/19 which was the day the problems began. I noticed a damaged trim piece and I called it to the salespersons attention who in turn got the body shop manager involved. They said they would take care of the issue. When we went to sign the papers no we owe for the trim piece. Oh yeah, I forgot about that, after reminding them the paperwork was filled out. Well, it only took 3 times of ordering the part and trips to the dealer to get the proper piece put on. No big deal, its installed. The real problems started six days after I purchased the truck. Here comes the first recall in the mail. This one has to do with an intermittent steering failure due to a faulty ground connection. No parts in stock. Have to order it. Parts comes in, I have to take it back to have the work performed. Then almost 30 days later here comes the second recall notice in the mail. This one was for the brake pedal that could possibly fall off if you use the adjustable pedals. Again, no parts in stock. Have to order and be put on a waiting list. After several calls to FCA, and being hung up on one of those times, I was told that the repair parts were being issued to dealers in limited quantities. Can’t slow down production to take care of current customer issues, now can we? FCA advised me in the meantime, just don’t use the adjustable pedals. Of course, I already had, and the vehicle will be safe to drive. I don’t know about you but I’m not willing to risk driving a vehicle that the brake pedal could possibly fall off of because a customer service rep from FCA tells me it’s safe. I still haven’t been able to figure out how intermittent steering loss and the possibly of your brake pedal falling off is safe but I digress. FCA did give me four free oil changes for my trouble. SCORE!!! Then the front brakes would squeal terribly during stopping. Apparently, this is a known issue as there is a service bulletin on the condition. The solution, replace both front brake calipers and pads. That’s right, all new front brakes. Mind you there are only 2300 miles on the truck. Most of which was going to and from the dealer. The other issue is the speed adjustable volume can barely be heard at all. Why is the volume adjustment inadequate you ask? The reason the service advisor gave me was because the active noise control module is interfering with the speed adjustable volume. FCA has designed two systems that interfere with each other and installed them on a vehicle. The current solution to this? Use the steering wheel controls to adjust the volume. Service said they tested other 2019 Ram’s on the lot and they all display the same condition so it’s not really a problem. By that logic if every engine explodes at 5000 miles then it’s not really a problem because hey, they all do it. I spent an extra $4,595.00 for the level 2 equipment group and another $1,095.00 for the 12-inch display and this is the answer I get. Completely unacceptable. I have been buying Dodge Ram’s since 2001, which is still on the road, and this by far is the worst Ram I have ever purchased. Three months in with these many issues I don’t want to think of what is next. If you are in need of a new truck now, stay as far away from the Ram as possible. I should have gone with my gut feeling and spent the extra money and bought the Ford. Save yourself a lot of time and trouble and buy something else. Time to see if I can get FCA to hang up on me again.

ram,1500,2019,No more Rams, 07/03/2019,2019 Ram Rear Bed Defect,1,"Beware the Ram and its rear bed assembly! My daughter's truck has a gap where two bed seems are supposed to join. She didn't notice it until several days post purchase. She informed the dealer and Fiat. Fiat will not replace the bed! The dealer would like to see it replaced but does not want to bare the cost. The dealer inventoried the lot and stated 40% of the Rams have the same defect! After several months of stalling and just wearing down my daughter, she agreed to basically a bubble gum and duct tape fix. She needed the truck returned to her for her business. An attorney was a thought but go expensive for what was going to be a much longer battle. This gap between the seams of the bed was wide enough to see the ground underneath!  40% are defects so beware! Bring back Chrysler to American ownership and know how please!"

Dealership can only say “it comes from a vendor so we don’t know”. Many people reporting this issue at less than 2k miles.

ram,1500,2019,Chris Thomas, 12/24/2018,"The perfect truck, except for poor reliability",2,"Wow. Beautiful truck. And there’s a great chance you’ll have to appreciate it from afar because it will spend lots of time at the dealership service center.   Look, I spent a lot of time researching this truck. I read the Internet forums and I spoke with a couple friends who are mechanics at FCA brand dealerships. Everything suggested this is an awesome truck with more than its share of first year problems that need to be worked out. I discounted all of that, and assumed it is those who have the rare problem truck who complain loudest on line.  Not so. I’ve had my Laramie for 4 months now, and it’s spent about 3 of them in for repairs. The sunroof leaked and caused mold in the cab. The eTorque engine battery failed and there was a multi week wait for replacement parts. The eTorque engine gets worse mileage in city or on highway driving than the non eTorque V8 Hemi. The tow mirrors get stuck facing down when you go from R to D. Random pieces of trim seem to have issues staying attached to the truck at highway speeds. The brakes make all sorts of noise they can’t fix.  I’ve learned from making small talk at the dealership waiting area many many owners are having problems. Maybe not all of them, but you will live with a chronic state of anxiety about what will fail next on the 2019s. My advice is to stay away until the 2020s come out and have a time to prove whether Chrysler has their act together on quality and reliability or not.

ram,1500,2019,Tree, 03/14/2019,Didn't Make it a Month,1,"We brought our truck on February 21, 2019. Loved the features and the color. So did our friends, family and neighbors. We did all of our upgrades (tinted windows, trifold top etc.) By March 14, 2019 less than 2k miles in we have no truck. Around March 8th we kept getting messages that certain safety features like (lane keep assist, remote engine start/stop and hybrid features etc) were either disabled or not working. These warnings all occurred through no fault of our own. I chalked it up to is was a new vehicle and just needed to work the bugs out. Then the navigation would only work offline. I figured maybe it was a video or something we could watch to show what we were doing wrong. Then today the check engine light came on. It was immediately taken to the dealership. We were only told there is a hit on it and we would need to be put in a loaner. I had not seen the reviews that stated others had gone through the same thing. The majority of the reviews stated that Rams were the best and very reliable. I ventured away from my usual Honda brand and today I regret it more than ever. I guess you get what you pay for but this was not exactly cheap. I haven't even made my first payment and already feel like I have wasted my money. I hope we do not have to wait forever for a fix or have to repeatedly return the truck to the shop. But I have to admit that only 1,400 miles in and already up for repairs does not give me much hope. Buyer Beware.

That was the first of many problems I had over the course of a year including the side view mirrors not tilting, windows randomly rolling down, side steps deploying at random times, squeaks etc. etc., ultimately resulting in a case filed with FCA.

Now with 2,120 miles on the truck, not quite five weeks later I am concerned I've got a problem. On five different occasions the vehicle would not shift out of first gear. In each case I was stopped at a stop sign or red light and making a left turn. Upon starting up and turning the transmission remained in first gear, motor revving 4,000 - 4,500 RPM or so, until I realized I had a problem. I lifted my foot off the accelerator and let the truck slow down, it was still in first gear, almost came to a full stop, tried to slowly accelerate but still no shift. I brought the truck to a full stop, then slowly accelerated again, still no shift out of first gear. I again came to a full stop, this time put the selector knob into Park, then back into Drive mode and accelerated and the transmission worked fine. After the first four episodes I called the dealership and took the truck in the same day. First thing the service rep did is check for a OBD code, no code was generated. Dealership had it for four days and could not replicate the problem. Since I've had the truck back one more episode has occurred. Now I'm not sure where to turn. Also, one other thing should mention every time this happened it was at night

Me thinking to myself, ""wtf? I've never heard of that?"" So we p/u truck. Now a month later, Christmas Eve while shopping @3:30pm, truck shuts down again, tow truck arrives 1.5hrs later, truck taken to dealer, but service closes at 5pm, Service to see truck until Monday 26th; 4 days later 2nd time to dealer, dealer states they didn't completely clean glue off from terminals, so ""now its good, won't happen again"", truck p/u again. A little after a month, now Feb 2019, truck shuts down again for 3rd time, sent back to dealer. Informed dealer that we do not want truck anymore. Called corporate, opened a case, about 3 weeks later, received email that FCA will be repurchasing the truck and monthly payments to be given back. Other notes: Harmon Kardon 19-speaker sound upgrade. If you're buying a $55,000+ truck, you would expect to have crazy sounds for 19 speakers, right? Wrong. You could turn the volume to max and can still speak to each other without yelling. The sound quality is great, but sound volume sorry to say, sucks! Also, entertainment system does not save radio stations. About 2 days later, seems to always reset; again, sucks! Wind noise. Coming back from Vegas, strong winds making a whistling noise inside cabin was loud and overpowering the radio! It seemed to be coming in from behind dashboard somewhere. Other than that, the RAM was great, but not sure if will purchase another until ALL testing and recalls completed by RAM. I think RAM might have pushed out truck too early without the required testing.

August of ‘18, purchased the all new Ram 1500, 2019.  Trucks warning lights went off two days after driving it off the lot.  Took it in.  Next day picked it up and was told they just needed to reset a code.  Before I got home, the warning lights come on again, lighting up like a Christmas tree.  Dealer kept for two weeks.  Got it back, brakes began squealing loudly. Took it in and the dealer could not correct until the service bulletin was issued.  Really?  I had to listen to this for 3 months.  Next, leaky sunroof.  Why, the drain plug was not closed properly when built.  Got rid of it. Drove home another 2019 1500.  Well it had mold in it.  The driver side mirror rattled.  Found 9 screws in the backseat under the mat that had not been used.  I ended up with a new ‘18 Ram 2500.  The 4x4 serve light now comes on.  Took it in, they fixed it.  Replaced transfer case. Drove home and bingo, 4x4 serve light.  Took it back.  Replaced a module. Drove down the road and bing, 4x4 serv light is back on.  It’s now back in the dealer. Going three weeks without my truck.

I also sent them a certified letter demanding lemon law. I have called Chrysler multiple time since filing a claim and I am told some one will contact me in 24-48hrs. I have yet to hear from anyone. I know I will never purchase another Chrysler product again.

ram,1500,2019,Not To Happy, 11/13/2018,2019 Ram 1500 problems,3,"Well so far it had a really loud noise coming from under the hood like something was stuck in the fan, shut off checked under hood, nothing found, restart noise gone. Twice now when put in drive engine just races like its in neutral, moving shifter back in fourth to get in gear does not always work. Rear brake support slams on brakes when baking up when nothing around, ( I shut it off). When you come to a stop once in awhile the truck leaps forward like you just got rear ended in a crash. This thing is haunted, its has a lot of flaws, I'm am a 10 time Ram owner. This is a $54,885 truck. It rides Great, fuel mileage is not great, best stereo I ever heard. I hope they can get it fixed, so far dealer checked for codes, none found, no service bulletin's either. Love the new design and I know all new stuff has bugs, keeping my fingers crossed.

ram,1500,2019,Bohinski41, 06/30/2019,Complete Junk,1,"I've had the truck for 9 months with roughly 7100 miles and it has been in the shop 5 times for faulty mirrors. I have power folding mirrors but when I pressed the fold button they would open and close repeatedly until they over heated and stopped working. The dealership replaced both mirrors but apparently their suppliers for the actual glass part of the mirror use the cheapest part possible. Dodge couldn't find a mirror that didn't have some sort of distortion on it. After repeat attempts to have it replaced I finally settled with the 3rd set once they offered me 3 years of free oil changes and scratch and dent repairs for free. But today while returning gone from church I heard a click from the engine bay and my ac stopped working. I drove home popped the hood and the ac clutch or pulley is melted and has thrown melted plastic all over my engine bay. It's never had cold ac to begin with.

Delivery day one, truck has low refrigerant glove box light didn't shut off.  The Chrysler fix for glove bot is to tape a furniture bumper on the back of glove box door to shut off switch.  Ac was half pound low on delivery.  Two months later, the active noise cancellation system works when it wants to. If you downshift it is loud and never corrects. Only shutting off engine resets it so far.  The heater control knob dosent work all the time. On startup you get half heat even if knob on max. Turn it off and on a few times it works again? Wtf?

ram,1500,2019,Dave, 10/29/2018,Great Truck,5,"I own the 2019 Bighorn 5.7 v8 vvt hemi. I test drove the F150, Silverado, Tundra, Titan, before trying this truck. The second I started driving it I was hooked. It was easily the most comfortable of the 5 trucks I drove. Quiet and smooth. The Tundra had the second best ride.  The gadgets in this truck are far ahead of anyone else. From auto dimming rear and side mirrors, to a large touch screen that allows apple carplay and android auto. Lots of usb ports including usb c. My mirrors fold at the touch of a button.  The active and passive noise cancellation works great. I average 18 miles per gallon so far, but that has been steadily going up as I put more miles on. Quite often my readout says I'm getting 22 per gallon.  It has a ton of room with plenty of storage. This truck is a pleasure to drive.   Highly recommended.

ram,1500,2019,Frank PA, 11/02/2018,Poor Workmanship on an otherwise great truck,3,"I loved the Ram. I looked at other brands and decided that the Ram still had the BEST interior, excellent ergonomics (for big guys), ample power and shifting. So I did it again - 2019 Ram V8 LongHorn QUAD. HOWEVER..I was very disappointed after I noticed some poor workmanship all across my $47k investment. Since day 1, the nav has been glitchy - it won't load often and loses all presets every day. Sometimes the radio will work without the key fob anywhere close. Weird. The dealer will replace the radio, but since that complaint I found other issues. The rear sliding window unit was installed crooked and it might be leaking on the driver side where it sits 3/16"" lower than the passenger side. Sloppy and it grates on my OCD nerves! The tailgate ""open"" light comes on every morning, so I get out and slam it shut - every day. Sometimes the rear usb ports work on the first try. These are probably very fixable issues, but what's next?? If I could swap out of this truck, I would.

It was being held on by a wire. Nothing like laying on the ground, on the side of the hiway, pulling parts off your truck.  I'm very upset with this truck.

ram,1500,2019,D Stephenson, 06/26/2019,AVOID,1,"I know, you're not going to base you decision to buy this vehicle or not on just one review. But I can tell you with absolute certainty, I am NOT alone in my frustrations with this vehicle. In the past 6 months, it's been in the service department more often than it's been in my possession. For mystery warning messages, check-engine lights, transmission and throttle errors, and unexplainable loss of engine power. Not the dealership, nor the Chrysler engineers can diagnose the problem(s). But the WORST part, that should give ANY potential buyer some very serious red flags, is the fact that Chrysler LIED during arbitration proceedings regarding how long the vehicle had been out of commission. First model year gremlins can be expected from any brand vehicle, but a company that is willing to blatantly lie just to save a buck (on their customer's back) is one you should run - not walk - very far away from. So I am currently suing them under my state's lemon law. I know the truck is sharp looking, and you get a lot of truck for the money, but it simply is not worth the volume of problems you'll likely have. Go elsewhere.

UPDATE: nothing’s changed. All the same problems, and RAM refuses to fix or replace the truck.

ram,1500,2019,Ram Owner, 10/01/2018,Disappointed in my 2019 ram 1500 Laramie,2,"First time reviewer here. Positives- Beautiful truck with a high class feel and comfortable ride. A lot of features for a decent price.         Negatives- had mine for less than a month and have less than a thousand miles on it and I have already experienced the steering sticking when slightly turning left or right at any speed. When braking it makes a sound like the brake pads are worn, but it must be the rotors because it is brand new. The light on the back of the truck for the bed stayed on even though the truck had been turned off and locked for 20 minutes. GPS only works through the app. If you turn off the truck without putting it in park it will automatically put it in park for you which is great, but you have to turn the truck back then off to turn all of the electronics off.  When taking a left turn today I heard a slight pop in the front of the truck. The transmission is not as smooth as you would expect, it has ""clunked"" into gear several times. I do believe I have my first lemon out of the 9 cars/trucks I have owned. I should have waited, and I recommend you do too.

ram,1500,2019,Jake, 11/20/2018,Updating my review of RAM...in a positive way!,4,"Below is my original review as I had an issue with oil leaking from the rear main seal on day 4 of ownership. As you can imagine, I was very upset with this happening on a brand new vehicle! I wanted to update my review because I was impressed the way FCA and the dealer I purchased it from stepped up and took of the issue. FCA has checked in with me a couple of times just to see how everything is going with the truck too. It is nice to know they actually cared for 1 customer and I wasn't just one of 600,000+ trucks they sold that year. 

I'm am also very happy with the RAM! It is the nicest interior and riding truck I've ever drove! It tows very nicely and has a ton of power! The transmission is very smooth and seems to shift timely at all times. The mileage is good for a 5.7 HEMI! My overall is around 20 mpg and that includes a decent amount of city driving. I’m at 36,000 miles now and since my initial issue, I haven't had any additional problems. I'm enjoying the truck a lot and hope it remains reliable for many miles to come! BTW, I have the Laramie 4dr Crew Cab 4wd 5.6 bed with the 5.7 HEMI. The correct option is not available from the drop down menu.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I was a very happy Toyota Tundra owner for 9.5 years and 141,000 miles! I loved that truck every day I owned it! I decided to check out the new 2019 Ram for all its new ""features"". I had to say I was impressed and ended up purchasing a new 2019 Ram Laramie after I worked in a Lifetime warranty as I Fiat Chrysler's quality has always been suspect. Well, low and behold I did indeed confirm FCA's quality and workmanship lives up to their poor quality reputation; on day 4 of owning the Ram and a total of 220 miles on it, the Ram was leaking oil from the rear main seal enough to create a puddle on the garage floor! Of course, FCA is not helpful but rather wants me to begin the eternity process of Arbitration. I want to get my experience out to as many people as possible, so they do not make the same mistake I did. I wish I could go back in time and get another Tundra.

The only two issues I have are the sesitivity on the rear parking sensor that I shut off and the terrible issue with the Active Noise Control. The interior microphones are sending a low frequency hum through the speakers. It’s not drivable at this point because the sound is just so irritating. The only way I can drive it is with the windows open because that shuts off the ANC. Hopefully the dealership has answers for me tomorrow!!! But I don’t think they will.

ram,1500,2019,Howard B., 07/22/2019,DAMN,2,"I bought my 2019 Big Horn with 10 miles on it in May, and I now have around 6,100 miles on it. It has been youto the dealership 3 times and is still in for repairs as I write this. The problems have me looking at the LEMON LAW. Problem (1) ac blows then turns warm and when you take it off auto there's a humming noise. (2) The worst of the problems is the TRANSMISSION jerking when you come to a stop sign it's like someone has hit you in the rear, also I had to give it a lil gas when I miss judged on coming traffic jerking made it self noticed the rear end felt like it came out from under the truck very scary. The 5 to 10 MPH range you get this grinding jerking feeling in the brake pedal, also at speed especially in 8th gear I've had all the recalls updated and the problems persist. I was told that the brake pedal was the problem with the jerking that's not the right answer. I really am disappointed with FCA for not addressing the problems and being up front that there are issues with the 1500's especially the TRANSMISSION. Now I did look at other trucks but the RAM beat them out for comfort ride and interior and exterior. I have an 1500 Big Horn 5.7 2 wheel drive Black sport its back at the dealership for the fourth time for the exact same problem this is the last time for me had anybody else had anything similar happening to their ram.

ram,1500,2019,Ralph, 01/07/2019,Likin It!,3,"My first Dodge pick-up and likin it so far. I purchased the bright white 2019 Ram 1500 Lonestar Classic 4x4 short-bed with the 5.7 Hemi. The interior is canyon brown/beige, great looking and very functional. The 8.4 Uconnect radio system (without navigation) sounds great and works well although I will say I previously had the same radio on a Chrysler 300 with Navi and I liked that better. This radio does have Android Auto and Apple Car Play so you can connect to navigation through it but your phone has to be tethered via the usb. On the plus side you can connect to Waze or Google maps and both work great. The 5.7 Hemi 4x4 has a listed highway mpg of 21 but the best I could get was 19.5 without the AC running and keeping the speedometer at 65 miles per hour so I don't know how they came up with the 21 mpg. City driving for me is at about 16 mpg. Acceleration is great with no noticeable lag when the AC kicks on and it never seems to struggle to find the right gear except for a slight lag when shifting from reverse to drive or vice versa. I am impressed with how quiet the cabin is as very little road noise comes through even at highway speeds. There are very few and almost non noticeable squeaks or rattles over bumps and rough roads and overall I would say this truck is well made. The roomy interior is the best feature in my opinion. The back seat space on my 5.7 short-bed is simply enormous and extremely comfortable especially on long trips. I also love the remote start feature in that the truck stays on. On my previous Toyota the engine would turn off as soon as you unlocked the vehicle. Speaking of the latter, in comparison, you get more from the Dodge Ram as far as features and a nicer interior plus you can add things like 4x4 and still be under the price of a similarly equipped Tundra. Will the Ram have the same reliability and low-cost maintenance over the span of several years is yet to be determined. My old Tundra never gave me any problems and even after 75k miles it was still driving as well as the day I got it. After my first year or so I'll post an update. Hoping for the best.

ram,1500,2019,MJ, 10/25/2018,Wow what a difference this new Ram is !!!,4,"My lease was up on my 2016 Ram Sport Crew Cab.  I looked at SUV's as well as pickups but once your in a truck its hard to downgrade to anything else.  Once I test drove a Ram I immediately knew it was the truck for me.  I like the redesign.  It looks much classier then then previous gen.  The LED headlights and fogs are an awesome upgrade.  The new tail gate that is aluminum and hydraulic and goes down nice and easy by itself is awesome and very lightweight.  I cannot believe how nice and comfortable the interior is even without leather.  I opted for the safety package with the front and rear sensors and blind spot monitoring which is all very helpful especially since my wife loves to drive the truck as well.  I do not like on the rear parking assist if you get to close to something how the brakes will jerk on all by themselves but its easy to turn off.  I also would have thought that when something is in your blind spot if you turn on your turn signal or try to change lanes that it would warn you and it does not unless its something I need to turn on.  As of this post I've only had the truck two weeks and put 500 miles on it.   The ride is so much smoother then the last gen.  If your need in a truck is to feel like your driving a big truck , go get a chevy this is not the truck for you.  If you want to feel like your in a mercedes car then this is the truck for you.  Very impressive from head to toe.  The room in the crew cab is the biggest in class and phenomenal for kids.  My son loves playing in the back.  My father in law bought a new GMC Denali 2500 pickup truck and he prefers my Ram.  I highly recommend this truck for anyone in the market for a classy pickup they are using as a daily driver and will still get the job done for towing a motorcyle trailer as myself or filling the bed with mulch in the spring for redoing your lawn.  I got the blacked out version with the new style black wheels and man its a looker. I get more compliments in this then I did when I had the scat pack charger!!!  PS... also like that Ram finally went to 6 lug wheels instead of the 5.  Much better

The Air conditioner in the 2019 is a joke it can be 95 outside and it will take 45 minutes to even get comfortable not cool just comfortable. And do not ask me about uconnect it is as much of a joke as the customer service that supports it.

First the ac didn't blow cold, more like luke warm air. The dealership had to keep the truck for five weeks and still couldn't figure it out. There was a loud struggling noise underneath when putting in drive, got louder and louder over time. Constant ticking noise in center under cab, dealership could never figure out what it was. Tailgate said open when it was tightly shut, several, several times. Navigation did not work numerous amounts of times, screen goes out or blinks constantly everywhere I go and freezes up a lot. Bought this truck at Keller Bros dodge, Lititz and they are a really bad dealership, they act as if these problems are my fault, and do not want to be bothered after they make a deal."
ram,1500,2019,Imran Saeed, 01/03/2019,ram trucks are way ahead of competition,5,"This is an excellent truck, a truly comprehensive package. It's clear that designers covered almost all aspects of comfort,  functionality and performance. It looks great and provides luxury beyond comparison to other manufacturers.  Ride is of a luxury German sedan quality as well as fit and finish are exquisite.  Kudos to the designers and all involved in this project.  I can see the other manufacturers trying to catch up to Ram, but it's truly a leader in this class. Only thing missing is a grab handle above the front doors ( like in luxury cars) . The 12 inch navigation screen is an amazing addition of design and functionality. It still leaves plenty of knobs around for a quick adjustment without diving into the menu.  Seat comfort is of a luxury couch, no fatigue after an 8 hour drive. Leather is supple and color scheme is extremely pleasing.   I feel sorry for Ford and Chevrolet buyer. They are truly missing out

Update after 11k miles... 
One oil change and tire rotation, cost 65.00 at local shop. Started truck 2 days ago and check engine/stability control module off is indicated. Multiple recalls notices that I haven't addressed yet. Will make an appointment within few days and see what's going on.

Did purchase an extended warranty from Mopar for some piece of mind (probably will be needing it). Still no regrets on this amazing product. Will do it again in a heart beat.

You want to adjust the steering wheel location? Release the locking mechanism, move to the location you want and then lock it back just like in a Tradesman. Auto dimming mirrors? The rear view mirror in the vehicle is all you get for that kind of money. The outside mirrors don't dim. Automatic climate control is a joke, very poor response to change in settings. 60 degrees outside....I set it to 73 degrees.....it responds by turning on the A/C. Sometimes the ride height adjustment doesn't work and forget about the vehicle automatically lowering to the enter/exit position when you put it in park (like my Grand Cherokee Summit does). It isn't quiet and the ride isn't great. The eTorque feature doesn't seem to be making a big difference my fuel economy. The automatic running board deployment is a nice feature. The interior is very nice. 12 inch display has its advantages. If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't buy this model.

However, my gas mileage is only 16.9 mpg on highway driving at 70 mph.   If I slow to 60 mph, I’m over 20 mpg. Safety and technology are second to none.

ram,1500,2019,Iowa Ram, 03/24/2019,Longhorn 5.7 goes to AA!,4,"PURCHASED a used low miles 2019 Longhorn.  Traded in a 2013 Longhorn w 265,000 miles.  The new one has a drinking issue, can't get more than 16.5 mpg on hwy. I drive alot of long drives, and my 2013 ram, same 5.7, 3.21, 8 speed trans, ALWAYS got 18 to 20 mpg, unless the wind was strong.   I've talked to my dealer,  they dont have answers,  and how I found this site.  I put on 50k miles yr, and couldn't say enough great things on my 2013.  I love the upgrades of the 2019,  ride, interior,  and exterior appeal, but very shocked the exact same engine, tranny and axle its sucking at least 4 mpg more.  This truck does set higher, having the off road pkg.   16.5 mpg is over 600 to 1250 miles, and includes 2 lane hwy,  which should push the mpg up, at least the old did. If AA can't heal this Hemi, A GMC will.  THIS TRUCK avg around 15.5, short drives 14.  I'm tracking the gallons, not using the trucks estimates, which hit a high of 17.2, but not accurate.  My old Ram was consistent and very, very reliable for 265,000 miles.  Fiat has tweaked it, based on so many comments of the THIRST of the 2019 5.7 hemi.  Americans like better options, not the old bait and switch, FCA.

ram,1500,2019,Jason , 09/14/2019,Less than thrilled,3,"Power is great. 5.7 L Hemi with a 392 rear end will pull my fully loaded 30 foot travel trailer up over a mountain on a Logging Road. Should have waited for the third generation as the 12 inch touch screen on my Limited is less than desirable. Functions maybe more than half the time correctly. Sometimes it will display  the satellite radio station and sometimes the screen will be blank. Yes, I checked to see if the screen was on or off. Sometimes it won't change  modes from FM to satellite and sometimes it won't change from satellite to anything else.  Depending on its mood it might let you change radio stations  when the screen is blank  but don't count on it. If you want to use voice texting you have to have your smartphone plugged into it with the c to C cable  otherwise you can only use predefined messages. The map was out-of-date the moment I pulled it off the lot  so you may as well use Google or Waze. Electronically speaking sometimes the aerodynamic mode will engage at the correct speed sometimes it wont. Sometimes if I use the entry exit mode it will stay in entry-exit mode on my 1 hour commute home at speeds about 70 miles an hour. Sometimes the cruise control works and sometimes it doesn't and gives me an error message on the screen. Sometimes the ventilated seat fan is noisy and sometimes it isn't. Really this goes for just about every electronic Gizmo and gadgets this truck has. I'm a gadget person and spend a ton of time in my vehicle. I've got nearly 24,000 miles on it and I bought it last December. Having a 392 rear end the fuel economy is pretty good compared to older vehicles but there is still room for improvement on this 8 speed transmission. It's already had a few recalls address. The sunroof spring that keeps the wind deflector up when the sunroof is open as already broken and I've been waiting on parts for 2 months. Usually the adaptive cruise will work correctly but once in awhile it will surprise you and not in the way you'd like to be surprised. The lane keep assist works okay but sometimes it's willing to correct you on one side and throw you into the river on the other side so you can't rely on it in the way you might think. The voice activated navigation leaves a lot to be desired when it works properly.  Every time I'm in the truck and I connect the same phone I've had since I got the truck it asks me if I want to make this phone my favorite.  As if I was going to change my mind. I could probably go on and on but I will spare you. I told you about the major things that bother me hopefully these will be worked out in future Generations.
For the purpose of accuracy my pickup is not listed on the choices, it's got the 5.6 foot bed with the 5.7 liter Hemi and it's a limited 1500.

ram,1500,2019,Phil, 09/07/2018,2019 ram is best truck on the market as of today,5,"Been looking, test driving and pricing all the newest half ton Limited model trucks for weeks. Toyota is dated and has the worst fuel economy. Chevy/GMC just didn't feel modern or updated enough. Ford F-150 is due for an update lacks modern appeal and expensive. Decided on the new Limited 2019 Ram 1500 truck. In my opinion Ram is the best looking exterior and interior 1/2 ton truck on the market. E-torque mpg is incredible.  Modern Interior, great interior storage bins. Comfortable seats front and rear. Quality material, U connect works perfect and easy to operate. 12"" navigation screen is by far a game changer. Impressive adjustable air ride. Tows my 7500 lb trailer effortlessly.  Time will tell on how reliable this new truck will be but, for now my Ram has been the great decision. Also, the 2019 Ram Limited was over $5K cheaper than the comparable Limited F-150 out the door. Go Figure
"
ram,1500,2019,Peter, 07/22/2018,"Comfortable, but UConnect is letdown!",3,"First the positives: This is a very comfortable and quiet car/truck.  The reviews likening the ride as being like that of a luxury sedan are spot on.  Seats are comfortable, ride is serene and the bumps are mostly absorbed.  You still get a bit of rocking motion over bumps, but that may have to do with the high center of gravity.  This 1500 Limited is just about as comfortable on a long highway cruise as any luxo sedan or SUV I've ever owned (Equus, QX56 and 745i).  The premium stereo sound system is very nice and rivals anything I've ever had in a car.    If it weren't for the UConnect issues below, I'd have given the RAM a 5 star rating.

On the negative side:   The highly vaunted UConnect system leaves MUCH to be desired.  
If you plan to use an iPod connected via USB port, be prepared for disappointment.  I've got three of them containing 7500 tracks of music and audiobooks.  All three are synced to my PC via iTunes, so all three have basically identical content.  (I use one in each of my three cars).  None of these iPods works correctly in the RAM.  

The worst offender is the newest iPod Touch.  Just about every album I call up shows duplicate track listings.  There aren't any duplicate tracks in the albums, but the UConnect system lists them twice, which wreaks havoc when you're trying to select a track from an album.  This is a deal killer.  Had I done more than a cursory check on the test drive, I probably would not have bought the RAM.                                                         

As for my two identical iPod classics:  On one, some songs and playlists do not display on UConnect, though they are definitely on the iPod.  This does not seem to be a problem on the other iPod classic. However, both suffer from not being ""valid"" or ""supported"" devices when I start the car after it's been off for a while. If I disconnect and then reconnect the device, the system does indeed connect to the iPod, though the index build then takes forever (and you can't browse until this is done).  Once they are finally connected, the iPod classics for the most part work well (except for the genre bug I outline below), but you'll have to disconnect and reconnect every time you start your car.

One common problem with all three devices (and any USB connected flash drive for that matter) is that browsing genres skips a step.  For example, when selecting genre Audiobooks, I expect to be presented with a list of book titles to choose from next.  That's how the iPods themselves navigate.  Not so in UConnect.  The next level is the track level.  In my case, I have literally hundreds of tracks in alphabetical order to scroll through to find the chapter in the book (or the track on an album) I'm looking for.  Selecting genre Alternative, should return a list of albums to choose from, not every song tagged with the Alternative genre. 

I took the car to a RAM dealership.  After several resets and an hour's worth of experimentation, the technicians threw up their hands and suggested I contact UConnect Support. UConnect Support initially suggested I try resets, and when those failed to resolve the problem, they said - take it back to the dealership.  I have since placed several follow up calls with UConnect Support.  Their last word on the matter was that I'd have to live with these deficiencies (and the ones below). 

Perhaps I'm too old school to matter, and everyone else who drives one of these uses Sirius or an iPhone connected via Bluetooth, but I find this ""you gotta live with it"" attitude from UConnect Support unacceptable. All three of my iPods work splendidly in my Toyota Highlander, my wife's Sienna and even my older Mercedes SL550.   

Other UConnect issues:  
In my experimentation I discovered that, if I connect the iPod touch via Bluetooth, the duplicate track listing within album  problem disappears.  Unfortunately, then I can't
 used my Android Phone to place or receive calls.   

To use Android Auto or Apple Play, the phone must be physically connected via USB port.  This renders wireless charging useless for the phone.  The phone charges via the USB connection, and if you tuck your phone into the wireless charging bay (because it seems a convenient place to store the phone), you'll get an annoying flashing red light. You'll have put the phone elsewhere. If you want to charge your phone in the wireless charging bay, you can't be plugged into a USB port, which means you can't use Android Auto or Apple Play. Design flaw!

When the phone is in Android Auto mode, voice commands in Google work as well as they always do on the phone. If you use Google Maps as your nav-system, because RAM's voice commands in the car's navigation system are hit or miss, you lose the 12"" display.  
 
U Connect is not all it's cracked up to be.  If you're planning on using any devices (phones, iPods or USB flash drives) in your RAM, spend at least an hour on your test drive making sure these work as you would expect them to.

ram,1500,2019,B Tindall, 01/15/2019,If Zeus could be a truck this would be it.,5,"Hands down the best value on a truck. I have driven Toyota all my life and when I started shopping Ram was #4 on my list. I am sure glad that I did my research. I don't feel sorry for people that are brand loyal. If you don't do your homework then you can end up not getting the best deal. Man Chevy really needs to step up their game. Cheap cheap cheap is all I see when I look at it after having the Ram and knowing what quality looks like. Toyota has had the same truck since 2009. Ford are too pricey and the ecoboost not every one, but I know enough people who have had the engine to blow up before 100 000 miles due to the turbo pushing the motor too hard . Average about 14-16 mpg in the city in the ram and 18-20 on the Hwy. Which you do not buy a truck for gas mileage for the most part. Some have gotten worse and better. The interior of the ram is so nice with more room than any other of the 4 trucks. Plenty of charging ports. Plenty of storage space all throughout. Love the heated and cooled seats with suede and leather. Love the way it handles the road with no outside noise. Love the interior lights at night time all through the trim of the interior which you can have on in the truck while driving so it's not too dark and you can see all of the inside without it being distracting. High definition backup camera is very nice with the backup and blind spot sensors. If you have trouble backing into things this is the answer for that because it will not let you hit anything. It will automatically stop the truck before impact. Tows my boat and utility trailer like a dream. Also blind spot monitors loads up to right at 20+ ft or so automatically. Nice automatic folding power mirrors with defrost and integrated turn signals. I like it because you can't see the signals in the truck but when people are behind it they really make a difference. Top all that off with the best paint jobs in the market and factory 20 - 22 inch wheels with 15 inch 4 corner disk brakes. To keep from writing a book I will stop at that. Go drive one. You will not be disappointed.

ram,1500,2019,Lyle, 05/07/2019,"Early days but, WOW!!!!",5,"I just bought my new Hemi powered 4x4 towing capable limousine yesterday and I love it. I've driven all the competing products and this is the best driving full sized pickup on the market. Driver assistance tech provides useful help without being painful to use. My daily commute is 104 miles and I've done that for the last four years in a 2015 Silverado LTZ Z71. At zero dark thirty, this thing lights and unbends the country roads where I start with an extremely satisfying competence. By the time the sun finally starts to do some work and I'm in the highway rush with rock haulers and school buses, I'm relaxed and perfectly happy to let the adaptive cruise control do most of the work in maintaining spacing. There is no useful comparison between this new RAM, my 4 year old chevy, or the competition's current model year trucks in terms of performance or comfort. This RAM is head and shoulders above them all in those fields. I really liked my Chevy when I bought it, but the new ones are ugly, ride exactly the same as my old one, and still have that off-center steering wheel that ensures an off-centered driving experience that translates into actual pain for me these days. I could spend $10,000 more on a similarly equipped High Country, Denali, or F-150 Platinum, but there isn't any compelling reason to do so. If this truck provides me with 4 years of reliable commuting, it will have been an awesome purchase. If not, I'll update this review. In the meantime, ""WOW!!!"".

Update - I waited until May of 2019 to buy my 2019 1500 Limited purposely to give FCA time to work bugs out of their production and parts lines. I didn't buy the E-torque as it seemed an unnecessary complication in what WAS a pretty reliable drive train, so I prepared for crappy Hemi gas mileage with the 33 gallon gas tank instead. What I got was a ready to road trip high end luxury vehicle with 4 wheel drive and the ability to tow over 12,000 pounds. My wife and I commute together and she just bought a loaded Genesis G80 a couple of weeks ago. That car is ALMOST as nice as my truck. After letting her chauffeur me for the last two weeks in her new G80, I have seriously missed driving my 1500 to work and today's commute with it led to this update. My sole issues with this vehicle to date are the occasional need to restart infotainment system. I believe I have had to do this 3 or 4 times to date to fix audio or phone connectivity issues. I'm an IT guy and a computer that you've only had to restart 4 times in six months of daily use seems reasonable to me, but other folk will have other viewpoints. Anyway, FCA has hit this one out of the park as far as I'm concerned. My 2015 Silverado and it's 2019 GMC contemporaries could not compare, Ford's all aluminum body + new drive train every year + sky high prices don't get a passing look, while Toyota's handling sucks and Nissan's cabins sound like a hurricane on the highway. Anyway, I've put a lot of miles on this thing in a short time, but I have loved every minute that I have spent driving it and regularly make excuses to take it for errands or whatever. Sometimes, I drive it 30 miles just to wash it. I'll usually pick up some groceries or whatever too, but I really just took it to wash it.
UPDATE: 30K and I'm still loving this truck. My wife bought a 2019 G80 with all the bells and whistles and my truck is still way more luxurious than her luxury sedan.
UPDATE: 40K and I'm still in love. Added an AMP Research bumper bed step and now my overweight and disabled old tail can clamber in and out of the bed without hurting myself. Since Covid, I've been working from home and pretty much make excuses to drive my truck for any minor errands between medical appointments.

Literally cannot believe that its in a truck, and a Ram at that.   The deals during the Year End Closeout Event are incredible.  Got my new luxury ride for $14,000 under MSRP.  And for those that read all of the previous reviews, the steering wheel does have audio controls.  They are located on the back of the steering wheel (on both sides) not the front.

ram,1500,2019,Jason, 06/19/2019,Rush to be first,3,"I purchased my 2019 Ram 1500 Limited with the 5.6 foot bed and 8 cylinder engine in November of 2018. The good; plenty of power with the 5.7 liter V8 and the 3.92 rear end. While towing my 7500+lb 30 foot travel trailer good road handling, engine braking, kind of bouncy in the back end.  I found the fit and finish to be well done, comfortable and appealing. I like the power adjustments for the driver's seat. I have herniated discs in my lower back and adjusting the lumbar is great for that. Also the heated and cooled seats front and back are amazing. The 12.1 inch screen is large and very easy to read. The controls that do work well are very easy to understand and operate. For the most part the cabin noise is nonexistent with the exception of the driver side rear door always sounds like the windows open. There is a ton of room in this vehicle, my grandkids are no longer kicking the back of my seat and I can easily get them situated and the German Shepherd between the two to keep the peace.           Unfortunately the list of things I don't like is longer and mostly just annoying and I'm trying not to be too critical but this is a $67,000 vehicle.  I find a lot of the technical or smart features glitchy and unreliable. One day I drove my commute home which is 48 miles in the entry exit height mode because that's where it stayed after I got in. It is not supposed to stay in the entry exit height mode after about 15 or 20 miles per hour. Occasionally the computer will not allow you to change the right height from normal to aerodynamic or back the other way when driving at speeds above 35 miles per hour. There are settings to tell it to go into the aerodynamic mode automatically at highway speeds I think it's 55 miles per hour but that doesn't always happen.  One of the features that attracted me to the vehicle is the ability to follow the vehicle in front of you at their pace and adjust the distance you are following. That usually works well, but sometimes if a vehicle is turning and they are a good distance in front of you and you have the distance at minimal (means you'd normally be following too closely) the vehicle will start to break sometimes quite strongly when normally even a prudent person would not brake. Additionally, if a vehicle in front uses a turn lane and is completely out of the way the system will start to brake when a prudent person would not use the brakes and safely pass by the vehicle that's turning. The lane keep assist is another feature that attracted me to this vehicle. This feature Works about 50% of the time in a way that I would expect it to. Sometimes if it corrects you one way it'll throw you over the line on the other side even though it can see that line according to the indication in the instrument cluster. So, it's not a self-driving vehicle by any means and you have to be prepared which means don't use this feature as permission to stare too long at that giant screen or even the beautiful scenery outside. My wife does not like this feature, she says she feels like she is fighting the vehicle. I guess it's a pretty good feature after all. Now to the screen itself and some of the features. Sometimes the screen will go blank like it did to me this morning, the indication inside the instrument cluster above the digital speedometer tells me which Sirius XM radio station I'm listening to in quite an abbreviated form but there's nothing on the big screen. One-time recently radio just stopped working and I had to shut the vehicle off for a few minutes before I could turn it back on to get that to work which included any functions that came along with it like navigation or telephone. And this occurred after the last recall which  required a Flash update about a month ago.  The driver memory function works good, except every time my phone connects it asks if I want to make it my favorite. Some of the cases
 in the instrument cluster are redundant and not very well thought out. The moonroof is great but sometimes doesn't close as expected. The running boards take too long to deploy if you're in a hurry they can trip you up. Auto high beams are no substitute for driver input. The economy sucks unless your drive is at 40 miles an hour. The cylinder deactivation reactivation is noisy and clunky. The axle lock button is poorly placed and I often hit it with my ET fingers without realizing it. Navigation is okay for 20 years ago but seems unintuitive. The premium leather is great but there is a seem that runs the length of my thigh that overtime is uncomfortable. The Chrome accents are nice until the sun is hitting them and reflecting in my eyes while I'm driving. The oversized rear brakes squeal when first driving after being parked. I'm on my third recall, I'm sure my new Ram has ADD. I have a lot more to say but there is limited room on here which is lucky for you.

On long trips the ride and comfort of the 2019 Ram is superb. On a recent 1400 mile trip, mostly at interstate highway speed, I averaged 20.5 mpg, and this with the truck fully loaded. The new 12 inch navigation screen and the Ram boxes are worthwhile options. I'm glad that Ram doesn't place the highest concern on bed load and towing capacity. My Ram has all I will ever need.

They replaced the rear ones 4 months ago, and now they are ordering an entire new set of brakes all the way around. My passenger side power mirror motor went haywire and couldn't figure out when to shut off or start. My audio volume doesn't work at least once a week. Sometimes the Uconnect send out a loud beep that won't go away. The glove box lights that should or shouldn't be on have been twice to get flipped off.

ram,1500,2019,Tuk Williams, 02/05/2020,Former F-150 owner with No Regrets.,4,"I bought the 2019 RAM 1500 Limited V6 mild hybrid in September 2019 and I have no regrets.  For $47,000 I got all the tech gadgets I wanted that would have cost $58,000 or more in the F-150 Lariat so I feel like I got a really good deal.  I've had it for 6 months now and am very pleased with my purchase.

I can't say enough good things about this truck and only a couple of first-world critical observations.  It's a very comfortable ride (not a luxurious ride but far better than bouncing around in the F-150).  The seating comfort is great, the leather is soft, the leg room in the back is unsurpassed, and the truck is the best looking one on the market in my opinion. The 12"" screen is responsive, intuitive, and clear and Apple Car Play actually works.  I love that when I start it (even remotely), if it's cold enough, the heated driver seat and steering wheel automatically turn on.  Because it barely fits in my garage, the braking assist feature has saved me a few times when inching as close as I can to the back wall of the garage.

I like the auto shut-off when stopped (I had this in the F-150 too).  The start and stop transition is much smoother than the F-150, given it's using the hybrid motor to assist start-up.  Plus all of the electronics continue working and the steering wheel doesn't lock - something that cause occasional panic in me with the F-150.

For a V6 full size truck the acceleration is adequate enough - no issues merging or passing on the highway, though the F-150 turbo wins in this category.

Some downside observations.  Granted it's been cold the last few months here in New England, so I'm naturally going to get poorer gas mileage than in the summer, but the gas mileage isn't as great as the F-150 (I had the 2016 V6 Eco-boost).  I'm getting a combined 20-21 (which is what the window sticker says anyway) but with the F-150 I was getting 22-23 combined.  My driving is about 70% highway.  

Another downside is that I find the cruise control to be very sensitive. Even driving up the slightest incline (barely noticeable), the truck will kick down to 7th gear and the instant gas mileage indicator drops down to around 12 (I tend to be a hyper-miler - I know what you're thinking, ""Why the heck did this guy buy a truck?""  I'm coping with the cognitive dissonance of owning a truck and being a believer in the man-made causes of global warming - it's not easy being me).  Anyhow, the constant downshifting gets a little annoying.  I think this is where the Eco-boost would shine because it could easily navigate up these mild inclines with the turbo without having to heft it down a gear.

I like the mild hybrid but, as I saw in one online video review, there should be some kind of indicator it's working for me. The towing capacity numbers were a little disappointing at first when compared to the F-150 V6 but fortunately for me I've decided to forgo purchasing a sailboat as it's easier and more convenient to rent one (and I can rent a much bigger boat than I ever could have towed).

I bought the RAM 1500 because I liked the looks, the ride quality, and the value in features when compared to the F-150. The gas mileage was close enough to not disappoint at time of purchase but that is the one thing that I wish were better.  I would have given this 5 stars if the gas mileage were as good as what I was getting on the F-150 Eco-boost.

Ford's got it's work cut out for it to come up with a new version that can compete with this beautiful truck. I would buy this again.

ram,1500,2019,Mike, 07/18/2018,So far so good,4,"So far with under 1000 miles the truck has performed well.  I really like the ride, the technology and the utility features.  It would be nice to have a tail gate step like the Ford but the other features make up for that. I know it's a truck but I was hoping for better overall mileage based on the published figures.  The truck only got 13.6 MPG on the freeway trip home from the dealer but it was delivered by the salesman so he may have really ""goosed it"" on the way.  With mostly city driving I have improved that to 13.8.  But again it's a truck.

ram,1500,2019,SM, 01/26/2019,Owned (3) F150s..Ram wins this time,5,"I love this truck... the comfort level is fantastic...5.7L engine is great, more than enough power... (came from a 2017 Ecoboost 3.5L)..The 8 speed transmission is so much smoother than the F150 was, and never has issues knowing which gear to be in, so much better than the Ford 10 speed that I had in my last F150...The handling is the best in any truck I have owned. I swapped out the stock rear sway bar for a Hellwig and the difference is well worth it, corners so flat.....I have the North Edition package which combines the best features of the sport and the offroad package combined into one..Extra heavy duty shocks, factory one inch lift, Falken off road tires, hill descent control, electronic locking rear end, etc.. Build quality is there, it's tight truck and no rattles over really bad New England pot hole roads..I know some people are having some issues, but overall most people are not..I'm on 2 Ram forums and by far most all are very happy owners, including me... Go to the F150 forums and you'll see all kinds of complaints. I had my share of issues with my last 2017 F150. Glad I made the jump..Bottom line is that it's a killer looking truck, that handles superb, is quiet, has great power, great sounding exhaust, super comfortable and fun to be in.. and you get a bit more for your money!!!!

Love the heated/cooled seats  front and back, double size moon roof, the 12"" X 8"" screen for navigation & music.

ram,1500,2019,Bill, 09/02/2018,Luxury for a truck,4,"Great vehicle! This is my third (04,09) and what a difference.  All those that have gone for a cruise have said “That is a WOW factor” not a truck.  Best vehicle I owned however disappointed with NAV - the speed limits are a bit off - in a 35 zone and the nav is indicating a 55 zone.  This could be an issue.  Maybe used to the iPhone maps.  But that is an issue because it connected on Bluetooth with radio on iPhone voice is muted.  Tried the solution as recommended in the web but still no joy.  The transmission shift is more pronounced than previous vehicles.  Hopefully there will be fixes for these minor problems.   Get 22mpg on highway - much better than than 18 with previous vehicle.  However it s luxury and don’t expect the 30.  As others have said - there are higher priced vehicles out there however the LIMITED is as good or better.  This is after 2200 miles on the clock.

ram,1500,2019,Jude A. Benavides, 10/15/2019,Hook ‘em Horns,5,"I’m not exactly sure if I’m just lucky or if the bugs have been worked out, but my 2019 Laramie Longhorn 5.7 etorque equipped HEMI is just perfect.  After 5,000 hard miles towing, hauling, road tripping and day to day commutes, I’m hard pressed to find anything to complain about.  In the absolutely great (6 stars out of 5) category:  ride, interior, engine sound and power delivery, safety, air suspension, technology, fit and finish and towing.  In the great category (5 of 5): exterior styling, overall engine power availability and torque curve, and the HK sound system.  In the 4 out of 5 star category: value and expected resale.   

Everyone.  And I do mean everyone that has ridden along and / or drive my truck leaves raving about the ride quality, fit and finish, attention to detail, styling and handling. 

I am a perfectionist.  I expected to be mildly disappoint to moderately disappointed in a few aspects of this truck.  I am yet to be even slightly annoyed at anything.  

I opted for the etorque and am amazed at how seamlessly it is integrated into the driving experience.  The start / stop is practically perfect.   It is hardly noticeable due to the quiet cabin.  And I mean quiet.  You only notice it when you see your MPG staying steady while at a stoplight and not dropping like a rock.  

The air suspension is marvelous.  And fun.  My kids love it (accessibility and cool factor).  

The black / saddle brown leather interior is just stunning.  Add the 12 inch screen and the mix of Wild West and new tech hooks anyone that sits in the cabin.  

Ram boxes are a must for my uses and have operated flawlessly.  Color match and fit issues?   Nope.  

I know this review sounds over the top.   Like I said, maybe I got lucky.  Maybe I’ll be back in a year shaking my head and wondering how things changed for the worse.  For now, the only hurt is the price tag.  But if you shop around, you can get great deals as RAM tries to outsell Chevy for the third quarter in a row.  

Hook ‘em!!!!

ram,1500,2019,Matt, 08/11/2018,VERY unhappy,2,"I bought the truck vs a new Tundra as the back seat is now larger.  Truck overall is beautiful but here's why I'm giving a low rating...the truck was $60k and the Nav system is not working, I've wound up spending hours and hours on phone and e-mail with zero answers from Chrysler.  Nobody will explain or admit that the truck was sold with this non working feature.  Due to the non working nav, it effects other features built into the electronics so you are forced to use your phone for everything.  3 months with the truck, and NO answers, no ideas, no nothing.  HORRIBLE customer service from Chrysler.  I did finally get a personal employee to open a case, and he was very responsive and pleasant but he offered zero resolution.  I went on a 4,000 mile camping trip, and a LOT of off the normal trail driving, and due to the non working nav it was a nightmare having to use the phone GPS for gas, coffee, eat, sleep, parks, weather, etc.

ram,1500,2019,John Smith, 04/25/2018,This is one nice truck!,5,"I’ve never been inclined to write a vehicle review but this one inspired me. 

Just picked this up about a week ago. Based on the short amount of time behind the wheel I can say this is the most luxuriously equipped truck (or car for that matter) I have ever been in. 

The ride is very smooth and quiet. The transmission shifts crisply and the engine is more than adequate to get moving - at any speed. 

The interior is amazing with the 12 inch touchscreen, panoramic sunroof and more rear legroom than most full sized sedans (I assume). The front leather seats are large and very comfortable. Overall the truck just offers a commanding view of the road and you feel like you own it. "

ram,1500,2019,David Mazzarelli, 06/14/2019,No Regrets on this Truck,4,"I purchased my 2019 1500 Laramie model in Jan 2019. Got the V8 Hemi with eTorque. Was a little hesitant with the new unproven technology but it’s been great so far. Have around 8K miles now on the truck. Don’t get me wrong, the truck isn’t perfect and it has been in for repairs, but the dealer has been more than helpful both times. Out the door I had terrible squeaky brakes. They tried cleaning them but no results. Ultimately at 1k mikes the dealer replaced the rotors and pads. No issues since. The other larger issue I had with the truck was a break down on the side of the highway. Engine overheated and had to be towed to the dealer. Turned out somehow the water pump belt came off. The dealer had me in a rental within 20 minutes and I was back in my truck 2 days later. Despite these little hiccups, I love the truck. More comfortable than any car I’ve ever owned and performs great. Towed 30’ toyhauler loaded at 8K lbs up the mountain memorial weekend. Didn’t skip a beat getting up the mountain. Hit high winds at one point and the truck did its job engaging the electronic stability control to minimize the sway. I drive mostly highway, so the hadn’t mileage is great. Average 21-23 depending on how much time I spend on city streets.

ram,1500,2019,Ram is king, 08/31/2019,My 4th ram,4,"Just purchased a 2019 ram Rebel love it but not perfect. The rebels ride is a little rougher than previous models. I'm sure it's due to its off-road suspension and tires.  Had some door alignment issues which was resolved. Like some other reviews the AC is definitely weaker than my other past rams. It takes forever to cool down and at a stop it barely blows out cold. Not good living in Florida. I was about to bring in for service to see if there was a problem with the AC but after reading some of the reviews I guess this is normal. Interior is definitely the best of all the trucks for sale today. I also think that Rams exterior is the nicest . Gas mileage definitely sucks getting only 13 to 14 MPGs. My father-in-law just bought a 2018 f150 EcoBoost he's getting 19 + City. But I'm more interested in looks and power. I did test drive the f150 still went back to ram.

Well, it turned out to not be awesome, but is an awful one. After four trips to the dealer, a call to CFA, and a lot of stress, I'm still extremely disappointed. I have the 12"" center screen which works when it wants to, the Navigation is the same. Works if it wants to, most of the time it's ""off line"" and won't do or show anything except the truck setting at the house. When I contacted the dealer and CFA they say there is a software update coming, but won't say when, say they don't know or if their 'update' will even fix the problem. The truck runs and drives well, but driving down the road with the rear view camera on (and won't turn off) is terribly distracting. It's either that or a total black screen. One would have thought that CFA would have made sure that this piece of junk would have worked before they put it  into production and sold it as such a 'wonderful piece of engineering'. After almost a year, no fix, and no clue on when there will be a fix, I will be leaving Ram very soon and probably won't be back.!! If you buy a Ram, DON'T BUY A LIMITED.!!  After almost 3 months the radio was replaced. Much improved, but still has it's problems.  Nav system still has intermittent problems. STILL will not load an address when put in.

They had to almost rebuild that engine as they took the heads off in addition to other things as well as put a new manifold on. I picked the truck up and after driving it a few days noticed an oil leak. Dealer kept it almost a week and replaced the rear engine seal.

I needed a 4WD, had a 2WD Ford F-250, 2WD, Diesel, extended cab and well, if not for the diesel that truck was average at best.  Great engine, 900 lbs torque, but got stuck in 2"" in muddy water.  Thus the need for a 4WD. I chose the 2019 Bighorn (which is not a selection in your dropdown with a 5.7, edmunds, you need to fix that) for the price first of all, then the the tow capacity (over 10,000), MPG  and then settled on just a nice looking truck with a gas engine and the crew cab is like being in business class from that cramped a** extended cab in the F-250 with straight up seats so NO on in the back was comfortable after 1 mile.  Just pulled about 1500 pounds, no problem and will take the big trailer out in a week or so, about 7000 lbs, we'll see what the RPM gauge does, hopefully doesn't keep revving to 5000 going up hills like my long gone 2008 Ram, 5.7.

The features are easy to customize and it can be changed to the user's preference. FWD works great. Interior is quiet and convenient. Reading the owner's manual and understanding how the vehicle systems work is essential. So much better than the salesman's explanation. The owners manual is well written and is an easy to use reference guide. My favorite feature is the blind spot monitoring. This includes a radar system in the tail lights that measures the length of a trailer and provides merging assistance when towing a trailer. My previous vehicle was a 2016 Ram Long Horn. The improvements on the 2019 Laramie are very easy to notice and makes this new model much better. So many ""bad"" reviews on the internet ... don't believe anything you read on the internet.

I love my leather, double-stitched seats and interior. The vented and heated driver and passenger seats are a great luxury. I am still figuring out the capacity of the truck's technology. It is definitely a truck for a techie.  I have the chrome edition, and even the bug guard is chrome. The attention to interior needs is outstanding - more cup holders, storage areas, and USB ports than expected. The foot pedals can be adjusted electronically (I do get a vibrating noise in my brakes when idling which is annoying). I have the new style grill - why get a 2019 and have the grill of older models?

ram,1500,2019,KD, 05/10/2020,Ram 1500 electronics,2,"I own 2019 1500, bought brand new. From start several electrical problems. VERY disappointed in truck. Only good things is room/comfort interior.
1. Info center console screen blacked out for 24 hrs(happened several times in last year and half or so.) Called dealer they didn't have an answer, i researched issue it appears in older jeeps and trucks and some chalk it up to a satellite update to center console. I found this and asked dealer about it and they ran with it since it came back after 24hrs.
2. Over head cabin lights and tailgate release did not work for first 3-4 months had it fixed at oil change. Only key fob or manually open tailgate worked.
3. Rear door on passenger side sounded like something lose in it, had it checked at oil change, interior panel inside the door came off. They fixed still sounds like it missing something, does not sound solid like other doors when closing.
4. Occasionally  when starting truck, it doesn't start, have to release brake and try again then it works, could be my timing is off but I push break prior to trying to start truck.
5. Sound system, if radio left on after turning truck off and then starting truck again volume does not work right have to crank to near 20 to hear any radio stations. I believe the surround sound goes out when this happens but if you check in the console it says it is working normally. If you turn truck off for long period of time after turning radio off first it will eventually work correctly.
6. Like others not impressed with heat/AC. Truck heats up then air gets cold in winter, have to crank to near 80-85 to get heat. I believe it draws heat from engine and then engine gets warm enough and levels out on heat then it gets cooler in truck. Happens in fall/winter. AC is not much better in spring/summer, Does not get cool like my jeep did or other vehicles I've driven.
7. Sun visor is loose on driver side, tried tightening it but can only tighten so much due to the plastic cap covering star screws.
8. I had to replace all 4 tires after about a year and a half, due to going bald and cracking like dry rot. I do long drive to work on paved secondary roads in pretty good condition. Average speed 50-60mph. Not alot of highway driving.

These minor issues are very frustrating for what I'm paying for the truck. Very disappointed in this product, I would go back to a jeep but afraid it will have same issues since Fiat is now building trucks. I also think Chrysler/Fiat used older parts in the 2019 1500."

Seems like a lot of other owners have the same issues as well. Folding mirror issues, Leaking rear windows, weird hum that the dealer can never duplicate, faulty rear sensors cause the auto brake to be applied when no object is behind you, radio issues with volume control, driver window regulator broke 3 weeks into ownership that they couldnt get parts for because the truck was ""to new"".......

ram,1500,2019,Itsover2020, 08/03/2020,"Drove for 30k miles and 13 months, waste of money",1,"This was initially a dream come true. Brand new black 2019 Ram 1500 with a hemi and rambox. However, right off the bat problem after problem and no Ram dealership could or wanted to fix. The defrost was broken. There was always air coming through the defrost vents even though they were off. This would fog up the windsheild almost all the time. Dealer refuses it's even an issue, says that's within spec. The power steering failed while driving and I almost crashed. Dealer took two tries to fix. The ac blows 10 degrees warmer than the last generation Ram. Don't believe me? I pinched off the heater hose going to the heater core and got the vent temperature into the high 30s instead of the 50s as designed. The door pockets were blocked when you closed the door. I didn't like the large center console and kinda wished I had gotten the jump seat. The console was large and not very efficient for me and became dirty quickly. The interior layout is poor. The ac vents are hard to direct air where you want. The radio has some weird volume fluctuations when listening to FM radio. I thought all the knobs looked cheap and were flimsy. Not firm like the last generation Ram. The vabration cancelation module went nuts randomly. The tailgate latch was defective and would randomly not open. The bluetooth was a joke. Hardly ever worked right. If you were listening to a cd and left the truck you would have to select the cd again when starting the truck. It's almost like the radio didn't care that you were listening to that. Same with other media. It's almost like you had to reinitialize everything every time you started the truck and sometimes things were not going to connect. 

The tiny gas tank was another hidden feature that's a complete downer. So frustrating having to fill up every other day because I tow for work and wasn't informed of the tiny gas tank. Ram doesn't disclose this information until after the sale. 

Are there any positives over the 13 months of ownership? The steering wheel was nice and the outside styling was great.

I work outside for a living and expect a truck to keep up with me. Unfortunately, the all new problems Ram 1500 wasn't up to the task and failed miserably! It really pisses me off because of the lost money, the extra sweat from the defective ac, and down right disappointment in Ram. I shouldn't have trusted them to build it right the first time.

What did I do? I went with what I know. Previously, I owned a 15 and 17 Ram 1500 and they were outstanding trucks. So, I traded for a 2020 Ram 1500 Classic tradesman. No frills, but completely functional design that I know will do the job. On day one of using my new Classic I could tell the difference. Glad the nightmare is over. I love just going to work and having a genuine work partner with me, my Classic. I hated going to work in the all new problems Ram because nothing was pleasurable. I fought the defrost, I fought the ac, I fought with the radio, I fought with the bluetooth, I fought with filling up at the gas station all the time, I couldn't win and that's not what a work partner should be.

ram,1500,2019,JohnneyO, 09/25/2019,New LongHorn 4x4 V8 Hemi,3,"I like this truck. I have mostly been a Ford guy for the last 30 years, but owned a 2014 ram and liked it. The Ram gives you so much more for the money. I got the upgraded sound system and touchscreen, backup camera, carpet, yes carpet. All the creature comforts are really nice compared to my more expensive 2016 F150. Now for the concerns. When stopping at a light or intersection I often feel a clunk from the transmission. Never felt that with the F150. When backing to hook up boat/trailer even when engaging the e-brake the truck tends to roll a couple inches, makes it harder to couple with trailer, the F150 did not do that. MPG is rated at 20mpg city and 23 mpg hiway. I am experiencing 14.7mpg-city and 18.4mpg hiway. The AC is supposed to blow air at about 40-45F. I am getting 55F out of the vents at 70F outside temperature. When outside temperature is ~90F+ the cabin never really cools enough. Service appointment on Monday. Hopefully they can fix. I towed my boat. Approximately 4500# with trailer and gear, and the brakes smelled very hot. never experienced this with my 2014 Ram or 2016 F150. Also the truck came with Nexen tires. these are absolutely the worst tires I have ever had on any truck I can remember. I have 3000 miles in a month on this truck and since I brought it home all it takes is the pavement to be a little wet and it slips. Taking off from a stop sign and not really accelerating to fast and it looses traction. So far this is the worst and why I gave it 3 stars.

I had to use my spare key fob and made an appointment to Lustine Dodge to get this issue looked at. When i arrived there the key fob was working intermittently, the dealership said it looks like you dropped it due to a little tear on the rubber piece. The rubber piece actually tore due to me putting it inside my pants pocket. They and Ram customer said they would not replace it. So when i asked Ram customer service when i get stuck somewhere because the key fob won't work and need it to start the vehicle,they had no answer and told me this was not covered under the 3 year warranty or the 5 year extended warranty. This will be the last time i buy a Ram/Dodge product. I never had any issues with other manufactures."
ram,1500,2019,MC, 03/06/2020,2019 Ram 1500 Rebel 5.7 Hemi battery,5,"I had the truck for 6 months. Good engine, no issues with transmission and love the terrain tires and the bilstein shocks on Rebel Canadian version. I have air suspension and it works great. I drove about 15000 km or 9300 miles. One issue I had was the battery went dead two weeks after I bought the truck but dealer replaced with a Premium battery they said is because stayed in the lot longer or the battery had a dead cell from manufacturing. I guess the US made battery was not good.
Breaks good, tires ok relatively good fuel economy,  I have the regular Hemi with MDS not the mild hybrid. I heard people complaining about the mild hybrid and the battery issue which for the mild hybrid is located behind the back seat. I changed to Synthetic oil Control at 8000km and will keep changing at 8k which is more often than recommend by OEM. I use a mix of 87 and 91 octaine to get an average of 88 to 89 overall and it works great for fuel economy I get an average of 13l/100km or 18mpg. I have the 8..4 Nav it works perfect,  I heard other people complaining about the 12"" screen and glitches; I love to have buttons out just a tablet so I got a good package with the 8.4"".Overall good choice

ram,1500,2019,Mark Andersen, 08/11/2018,Avoid all RAM 1500 with 8-speed transmission,2,"If you are planning on owning this truck beyond 100K miles, buy something else. The 8-speed transmission is NOT SERVICEABLE.  Twice, at about 90K and again about 130K, I begged my dealership to flush/fill, replace filters in the transmission on my 2014 Ram 1500.  I was told, ""it's a sealed unit, and you can't do that.""  How do you build a transmission and don't make it serviceable?  After all service done at two different Chrysler/Jeep/Ram dealerships (oil changes, water pump, front wheel bearing), my transmission went out at 161K.  My dealership told me it would cost $5600 to replace the entire transmission.  It was actually the torque converter that went out, but in the Ram 1500, they are one complete unit (you can't just replace the torque converter).  I drive a lot, but it's all highway with zero towing.  No stress on the transmission and it went out.  I called Chrysler and told them what my history was and offered to pay for $1000 - $1500 of the repair.  They offered me nothing.  Not a few % points off the repair, not a loyalty discount if I traded and purchased another Ram (like I would), nothing at all.  The agent I spoke to, put me on hold and talked to a manager, who told her to tell me, ""sorry, there's nothing we can do.""  So I am making it a part-time job to tell everyone I can NOT to buy a Ram 1500.  Here's a list of things I did like about it, until the transmission went out.  The look, the entertainment system, visibility, acceleration, braking, comfort.  Loved it all until the transmission went out.  I ended up taking it to Toyota, where I traded for a new Tundra Limited.  I owned a Tundra before the Ram and got 300K miles on it (and sold it for $11K).  I will never buy another Ram.  Don't make the same mistake I did.

ram,1500,2019,grant schibilia, 12/23/2018,Verbal text messaging,4,"The idea of verbal text messaging is to keep the drivers eyes on the road, this was possible in my 2017 Dodge Ram using the steering wheel controls to activate the texting feature, however with the 2019 model to activate the texting feature you must use Android Auto and physically touch the microphone icon on the screen, taking you eyes off the road.

ram,1500,2019,Moose Dar, 07/14/2019,Best truck on the market,5,"Purchased the vehicle brand new and was hesitant since this is the first year for this truck to start. I've owned every truck in every configuration. I own a large company with hundreds of trucks to haul large trailers. I used to have Ford, then GM and in 2010 switched to Ram.  Ram has been the very best all around truck for durability, maintenance costs and resale. This new 2019 Limited I purchased just for me. Right away I knew the ride was nice but after driving it for a few thousand miles, every single time I drive it, the ride is just too nice to even explain. The technology and cab layout is the very best of any truck by far. Everything in this truck is just so nice and if there was anything I would say lacks, it might be the fuel economy but I'm getting 19 MPG so that's not even a complaint. This is a solid truck and because of my business I have had to pick up the slack a few times for the other guys hauling lighter loads and with the air suspension this truck amazes me, I can load a heavy trailer and it never sags, the airbags take over. The LED lights are extremely nice, the 12'' screen is over the top nice, the doors shut like a million dollar vehicle, it is a very nice truck. When you look under the truck or when you open the hood everything is extremely clean and well engineered, nothing is cluttered at all.  The back seat area is so comfortable, it's just so nice.  Anyway, I've tried to pick this truck apart and I can't find anything wrong, its just such a well engeneered truck and I get a lot of people looking and when I go to a gas station it's almost an automatic someone will come up and ask questions or come and check it out.  Really a nice truck.

"
ram,1500,2019,Ram Guy in NH, 09/07/2019,Fantastic Choice,5,"The RAM 1500 is the clear winner of the full size truck market. Everything this truck brings to the table is ahead of the competition. The interior is fantastic. The infotainment is tremendous. Enormous, responsive and feature packed. The second row in the crew cab is spacious enough for full grown adults with room to spare. The Rebel package looks and performs well. It is floaty in sweeping turns thanks to those 33” tires but it is amazingly quiet and comfortable with a serious off-road package. 

My chief complaints: mpg is pathetic with the Hemi but full size truck buyers aren’t expecting 40mpg. I’m averaging 16.x over 1500 miles, mostly city with a high of 19.9 on the highway. Second, I’m having difficulty getting the drivers seat dialed in to my liking. It’s comfortable but doesn’t quite fit my ergonomics. This is a personal preference. Finally, do not get the tow package unless you truly tow all the time. With the tow mirrors, you lose so much: power fold, 360 view camera and are now several inches wider leading to greater difficulty in tight spaces (watch those ATM approaches). Those three issues aside, this is a vehicle that checks all the boxes for my family. 
"
ram,1500,2019,Jason , 09/14/2019,Less than thrilled,3,"Power is great. 5.7 L Hemi with a 392 rear end will pull my fully loaded 30 foot travel trailer up over a mountain on a Logging Road. Should have waited for the third generation as the 12 inch touch screen on my Limited is less than desirable. Functions maybe more than half the time correctly. Sometimes it will display  the satellite radio station and sometimes the screen will be blank. Yes, I checked to see if the screen was on or off. Sometimes it won't change  modes from FM to satellite and sometimes it won't change from satellite to anything else.  Depending on its mood it might let you change radio stations  when the screen is blank  but don't count on it. If you want to use voice texting you have to have your smartphone plugged into it with the c to C cable  otherwise you can only use predefined messages. The map was out-of-date the moment I pulled it off the lot  so you may as well use Google or Waze. Electronically speaking sometimes the aerodynamic mode will engage at the correct speed sometimes it wont. Sometimes if I use the entry exit mode it will stay in entry-exit mode on my 1 hour commute home at speeds about 70 miles an hour. Sometimes the cruise control works and sometimes it doesn't and gives me an error message on the screen. Sometimes the ventilated seat fan is noisy and sometimes it isn't. Really this goes for just about every electronic Gizmo and gadgets this truck has. I'm a gadget person and spend a ton of time in my vehicle. I've got nearly 24,000 miles on it and I bought it last December. Having a 392 rear end the fuel economy is pretty good compared to older vehicles but there is still room for improvement on this 8 speed transmission. It's already had a few recalls address. The sunroof spring that keeps the wind deflector up when the sunroof is open as already broken and I've been waiting on parts for 2 months. Usually the adaptive cruise will work correctly but once in awhile it will surprise you and not in the way you'd like to be surprised. The lane keep assist works okay but sometimes it's willing to correct you on one side and throw you into the river on the other side so you can't rely on it in the way you might think. The voice activated navigation leaves a lot to be desired when it works properly.  Every time I'm in the truck and I connect the same phone I've had since I got the truck it asks me if I want to make this phone my favorite.  As if I was going to change my mind. I could probably go on and on but I will spare you. I told you about the major things that bother me hopefully these will be worked out in future Generations.

ram,1500,2019,Douglas , 12/28/2019,2019 1500 classic regular cab short box 4X4 5.7,5,"I ordered this baby in Patriot blue pearl. It is the best truck I have ever had or experienced. GM no longer makes a regular cab short box and Ram may not be much longer but there are a number of us that love them.. this one is fantastic. I got the rear window that none of the others provide. plus probably the best audio for a regular cab. Only Ram offers rear coil springs vs. leaf springs which I think give a better ride.. I have had zero problems and the truck is the best I have ever had... In 1979 I bought a Chev Cheyenne , it was great at the time and I was stupid and sold it.. In 1993 I bought a Ford f150 still have it. all regular cab short box. Because of improvements over the years this is best.

ram,1500,2019,Wonderful truck/car/transporta, 01/03/2020,Bet ya can't beat this if you are honest.,5,"I have always liked the Dodge Ram truck and the 2019 models are the best yet! The coil suspension makes it drive like a luxury car and the improvements in the seats allow you to believe this is what you are riding in! The adjustability of the seats is fantastic. The handling is almost sports car feel and responsive and with the 5.7 Hemi, it reacts like a high powered sports car as well! I have seen no other pickup truck on the market with as many luxury items such as all the ac/dc power outlets as well as HMDI and other types of connections. Navigation tops the list of accessories but add on the great speakers AND the SURROUND SOUND button you have been transmitted to a real concert hall! I consistently get complimentary remarks about how beautiful the truck is and how much they love the appearance. It has a great tow package and the tailgate has a hydraulic assist so the tailgate does not slam down when released, even remotely. Being that it is made of aluminum it is also easy to lift for an older individual like myself. The pedal adjust, the automatic folding side mirrors, the wide display on the dashboard, are just a few of the great features that also include the heated/vented seats and steering wheel and you have a winner of a truck.

ram,1500,2019,Chris , 01/12/2020,Road/Wind Noise,3,"I have a 19' Laramie new body style 5.7. 2WD 
I came out of a GMC 2WD and I'm not loving the ride or road noise compared to GMC.  It's a pretty good vehicle with no breakdowns or problems.  I've had the dealer while getting an oil change to check the seals around the rear doors and nothing seemed to be wrong.  The noise seems to be coming from the rear doors or it sounds that way from the drivers seat.  The speed compensated volume doesn't work on the expensive Harmon Kardon stereo. 
On occasions the Bluetooth drops out and you have to disconnect from the phone and go to speaker on the phone. This has occurred  2-3 times. 
They could have built a great truck but I think FCA goofed by pushing them out without enough testing time. We'll see a what happens when I do take it in. 
I miss my GMC.

ram,1500,2019,Andy W, 10/27/2019,"The Best among the big 3, Ram did right this time.",5,"updated review at 11/4/2020: 
The ram has been running flawlessly. no issues with AC at all. The only small problem was sometimes cracking noise from the rear speakers, but not consistent. The mpg is low but expected from this 5.7 beast. overall very satisfied!  

I owned a 2016 F150 before, 2.7 V6TT engine. All good except for the occasionally sudden loss of power during the middle of the highway for 0.5-1 second. Some other smaller issues with door hatches and high way wind noise are somehow bearable. But i still sold it after owing it for 2 years. This time i was going to choose between Chevy and Ram, I like the new 2019 Chevy look , but the interier seems to be dated. And looking at the review on edmunds , the 2019 Ram is clearly a winner. Then i decided, i need to test drive the new ram. I test drove the previous generation Ram Rebel 1500, i was not impressed at all, it was driving like a big giant boat.  but 2019 ram's  driving is so much better , it felt like driving a big suv, not a truck. and the interior was so impressive , especially the big 12 inch screen plus all the safety features. It was clearly a winner. 
After drivng the ram for 2 week, the apple car play is signifcantly  better than my F150 or VW atlas. So the upgrade is not only mechanical, but also with software and hardware.  The AC works for me prefectly cosnidering i live in the eastbay of Bay area. during the day it was very hot, often over 90, but the AC was able to cool the cabin down pretty quickly.

I am considering buying a 2019 Bighorn, 4x2, 6'4"" box with the 5.7 Hemi. I really prefer the full body color exterior in the Blue Streak Pearlcoat, but . . . in order to get that you have to select the Sport Appearance Package . . . which has some features that DO NOT have anything to do with bumpers and grills, such as: Auto-Dimming Exterior Driver Mirror, Black Interior Accents, Deluxe Cloth Bucket Seat, Exterior Mirrors with Supplemental Signals, Exterior Mirrors with Courtesy Lamps, Exterior Mirrors with Memory, Power-Folding Mirrors, Power-Heated Mirrors with Manual Fold-Away. This is not to say that the chrome look is not okay, but to limit the exterior looks to selecting a specific package is not, IMO."

Only issues I have so far are the lack of advanced safety feature on cheaper trims. Just starting to get those feature runs you almost an extra 6-7 grand, I've seen other trucks for alot cheaper. But I didn't buy the truck for that I bought 8t for the ride and look. It delivers on both.

Traded in the 18 for the New Body 19 because of the body style change and quite simply just wanted the technology upgrades.  After 500 miles and my first road trip in the vehicle this weekend towing a Large Double JetSki Trailer and a family of 3 to the lake four hours away I must say this is an incredibly comfortable vehicle!  Drove great, pulled great and all passengers were very comfortable.  Blind spot detection that covers the trailer was spot on!  Wasn’t too sure of the 12 inch screen when I purchased it but I have already learned to love it.  Split home screen with navigation on top and radio on bottom is my favorite layout.  Enjoying the auto high beams and air conditioned seats in the Texas Heat!   If you have an option go for the 33 gallon gas tank which really limits your stops on the road!

Ram is supposed to have a flash fix to it later in Dec 2019. Got a great deal off the MSRP. Been back to dealer once for check engine light. When they checked the codes, 7 sensors were indicating some kind of trouble. Dealer determined the antilock brake sensor was loose and tripped all the other codes.

Pretty much has every safety/convenience feature that I could want and the ones I probably don’t  need :-) to include the 12” screen!  Smooth ride, powerful engine, awesome all around. 
Now for not so good news: 
Day 1: Dealership/Manufacturer: it was addressed immediately however it is still of concern - spent almost 65k and I expected better - detailing: the window had glue from the sticker, the inside did not seem to have been touched at all - they did offer a full detailing at my convenience.  Windshield washer fluid was not topped off and I figured I should do a quick check  - found that the passenger side wheel well plastic covering was not even bolted on - a few more miles it would have flown off!  At the very least I would have thought someone would do a thorough quality/safety check.... Napleton Clermont dealership did fix it immediately. However it should not have been missed in my humble opinion.
Day 2 - Ram Manufacturer:  navigation and other Alerts and voice guidance seem to divert to one speaker on dashboard - hopefully this is just a one time deal and I will get a call soon and it will be resolved easily and quickly! 
Once again great vehicle an I love it. However more attention to detail, proper safety/quality checks before delivery should be adhered to. Also read that there are bugs with Uconnect-Hope they find perm fixes and not just reset and hope for the best!

Within 80 miles from the Canadian border, the Lowest Price feature shows stations within Canada and cannot differentiate between $USD and $Can or Liters Vs Gallons.  Let alone that the system should show nearby stations.  I've written SiriusXM and have been advised that the info was forwarded to the proper team.  Weeks ago with no update.  Refresh the radio and call us they say.  How about a software update?  I've never seen this in the dozens of other 6.5"" or 8.4"" radios I've driven over the years.  Also, the Hemi mileage without ETorque is terrible. I get better MPG around town than on the highway.  Over 70 mph, the mileage drops significantly.  I averaged 16.5 with an empty truck on Michigan highways over 350 miles when driving an average of 75 mph.  In town with limited stop-and go, it gets around 18 mpg.  Minor frustration is the map pocket on the sides of the center console (bucket front seats) that is perfect for your phone to drop into, but too narrow to get your fingers into to retrieve it.

Purchased as ‘new’ of course. I also made sure the truck was built a year after they started building the first ones. For a brand new, ground-up re-design model, this all makes smart sense. Likely to be far fewer ‘work out the bugs’ issues to deal with, as the Customer.  I have had zero issues with the new truck (knock on wood). I love everything about it. Looks, interior comfort and amenities, quietness, rear seating and utility space, functionality, tech, power train, the ride... it ALL tops the F150 and GM trucks - based on my real world test driving of those new trucks too. Ram has hit a home run with this truck. Mine works beautifully. This Edmunds site, however, does have flaws. It won’t let you select the correct model and trim.

ram,1500,2019,Ed Boss, 06/10/2020,Not used to this length in 2019 Classic.,5,"So far, no problems other than parking when there is a small parking area.  Best riding truck with coil springs.  Air is cold.  Mostly bought this truck as my 2013 Ram took a crash of 70 mph when the driver fell asleep and hit drivers' side and I and passenger had no injuries.  Noticed it has 5-star front in crash classification. The other driver was killed.  I understand the new-gen 5 has an extra panel that keeps front tires from injuring occupants.  And of course, it is the most affordable.

ram,1500,2019,George , 06/28/2020,Love my RAM! Never thought I would.,5,"Had a completely different mindset about RAM prior to my purchase. Researched a number of trucks and RAM kept knocking down the competition when it comes to interior, driving comfort and engine options. The styling is much improved and couldn't be happier. The ONLY concern is the seemingly thin paint. Chips more than most cars I've owned in the past out of no where. I read this was an issue and hopefully RAM is sending loyal owners some type of remedy for $52,000 trucks that have paint chips even if you baby them. Bugs, carwashes and driving 70mph should not be a ""well what do you expect answer"" for paint chipping to the basecoat. This is a defective paint issue. I plan on keeping this truck for a long time. Would like to do so without having to have a new paint job in 5 years.

ram,1500,2019,funninaround, 07/23/2019,Bad dude,5,"A real truck with a real V8.  Sounds amazing, I have the 3.92 with the hemi and it'll put you back in your seat.  I have the black package in bighorn trim and it has the nicest wheels on the market.  4x4 off road package, pretty much as loaded as a bighorn can get.  Love it, comfortable and capable.  Got a long extended warranty, just in case!  Can Chrysler be trusted to make a dependable truck?  We'll see!
Update:  1 year later, and still very impressive.  Have had zero problems with my truck and it looks and runs like new.  Ram did a great job on this redesign, very comfy, powerful, and do it all attitude, and with the Hemi and 3.92, it's a undeniable race truck.  I'd never go back to a car or SUV, this truck is just as comfortable, and rides just as good, or better.  Gotta love it!

ram,1500,2019,Scott H, 01/03/2020,ram rebel - love it,5,"I have 13k on my 2019 Ram Rebel.  I look forward to getting in this truck every day.  The seat comfort, the sound of the stereo, the ease of the infotainment, the panoramic roof, the power, handling and space in the back seat.  I've owned 3 full size GMC's over the past 15 years and I never thought i'd buy a Ram.  After test driving GMC, Ford and Ram, I purchased the RAM.  There were things I liked about all of them.  The combination of exterior looks and interior form and function made the Ram come out on top.   I wish the gas mileage wasn't so poor but when you buy a lifted truck, with 400 hp on 33"" tires, you get poor gas mileage.  I love the truck - no problems yet, time will tell.  FYI  - this is the RAM Rebel Crew Cab v8 with short bed.  (model not offered so it shows the Limited)

ram,1500,2019,L Pfeifer, 07/28/2020,"One year, 10,000 miles and all good",5,"Well, almost all good. Got in the truck today to give it an oil change and the hood release was hanging in mid air by it’s cable. Didn’t see an obvious way to reattach it securely so maybe a plastic piece broke.  Put it back in place with Velcro and can’t tell  the difference.  Will get it repaired when I go in for the wiper recall.  This is my 5th hemi and with one exception, 2011, they have all been great trucks. Daily driver, work truck, tow vehicle.  The 2019 is pretty special, lots of luxury and comfort features. Very quiet and powerful. Rides as well as a car. 12 inch screen is a bit of a distraction  and the NAV system is less than intuitive but I’m learning. I frequently drive the length of California and this RAM is the perfect travel companion. I even average over 20 mpg with cruise control set to 75. No system failures so far.  About that oil change, what a pain in the ....next time the dealer can do it.

ram,1500,2019,Ralph B, 08/22/2020,Love this truck,5,"We've took delivery of this truck in Sep 2018.  It is a white Crew Cab, plain Hemi with large fuel tank and 5' 7"" box, all the safety features, and a 3.92 rear end.  We use it for trips back and forth from Alberta, Canada to our winter place in Phoenix, AZ and for normal runs to the dump, Costco, etc..   We love the comfort, capacity, and did I mention its got a Hemi in it ?   
There were a few electronic gremlins off the start, they went away after replacing the battery, all resolved under warrantee.  Love those Over the Air (OTA) updates.  As a side note, be aware when the battery is discharged many things won't work, like heated seats.  Easy to understand when you think about it, but frustrating when it happens.
We got a killer deal $11,000 off MSRP plus 0% for 60 months on the entire cost.  
I would recommend this truck to anyone but get the 2020 with the multi-function tailgate.

ram,1500,2019,Brian S, 09/23/2020,Glorified station wagon,2,"Owned a 2009 Ram 1500 previously so I understood the trade off of smooth ride to being embarrassed when you park next to your Silverado friend and your truck squats with a few hundred lbs in the bed.  That being said, went all in last Xmas on a 2019 Laramie.  4000 miles later I have a 5 gallon plastic container of gas that slid in the bed unsecured and hit the forward wall adjacent to the cab.  This resulted in the bed wall separating from the base because the PLASTIC screw pulled out and four Cheap weld points separated.  Local dealer put in a claim and Chrysler rejected!  Moral of the story...$61K should have been spent on a real truck that is engineered with truck parts - shame on me.  Plan to spend my days until my death repeating this story and showing the pictures to as many people that will listen.   Oh yeah, won't mention the 2015 Jeep Cherokee that had a garbage transmission that resulted in a class action lawsuit - keep up the good work Chrysler.

Was excited when I finally picked the brand new 2019 Dodge Ram.  Qiuckly my excitement was burst within the first month electrical control panel fired and truck would not work. Had to have towed to dealership. Have check engine light come on. Intermittent issues with bluetooth, radio, backup cameras. Numerous water leaks which could be causing all the other issues. Have called every time to mopar when these issues arose to have documented. Called about buy back since so many issues. The customer service agent real piece of work. What a let down.

ram,1500,2019,Shawn, 10/17/2020,2020 Ram classic,3,"Had my 2020 Dodge civic for a few weeks now, great ride, comfortable, looks great, but the MDS. 

What a world we live in, useless pinhead engineers spend countless hours designing and programming ""features"" on vehicles that are absolute trash just so the rest of us can spend countless hours figuring out how to disable that bull 💩  talk about being wasteful. MDS (turning my V8 to a 4 to banger) may be the worst thing ever dreamt up by one of these desk jockeys. 

When running on 4cyl the truck vibrates, drones and my 30 year old craftsman lawn tractor makes more power. If you want to go anywhere you gotta lean into the gas, then all 8 cyl fire up and hopefully the transmission is not mid shift or you can really hear it find its gear (bang). If your tranny is in the right gear then suddenly your getting way more power than you wanted and chirp tires.

For now I disable this ""feature"" by activating the manual shift sports mode, leaving it in 8th gear (shifts automatically still) I loose my overdrive which hurts fuel economy but I don't feel like I'm trying to start a manual truck in 3rd gear. As soon as my warranty is up the pcm is getting reflashed!! Gotta love HP tuners. 

Thinking on the green side of things I wonder what the carbon footprint of designing that [non-permissible content removed], implementing it, figuring out how to disable it and producing tuners/obd plug ins to disable it is vs. running an extra 0.1L/100km through trusty simple V8 would look like.

If I wanted fuel economy I'd buy a civic.

ram,1500-classic,2019,SSBroly, 01/23/2020,New full size truck owner,5,"I purchased my 2019 Ram 1500 Classic Big Horn as a fleet vehicle with 14k miles on it. It had everything I wanted except bed liner. I later decided to get the side steps for the kids and wife easier access. Not an ad, just trying to help others in similar situation. Purchased side steps from carid.com saved about $450, and has lifetime warranty. Bed liner from a local shop also with lifetime warranty for about $600 less than if dealer installed. 
I wanted to address the only 1 star review on here regarding dash brightness...you can dim the dash lights on the left side under the headlights switch. There is a slide knob/gear (?) Which turns on interior lights. If you turn it the other way, it dims the lights.
The only 3 star review commented on no radio controls on the steering wheel. I found them after a week of ownership. The volume controls are on the BACK right side of wheel and the skip controls are on the back of the left side of wheel. Weird I know lol!
**Back to my review**
I have used this truck to tow my trailer camper (6400 pounds, 23ft long) on three different occasions. ~6.5 mpg. The 2nd trip I was towing in 45 mph winds and it handled it like a champ. At 55 mph driving over an open bridge in gusty winds I felt in control the whole time. 

Plenty of room for my family (wife, 4 yo son, 2 yo daughter with car seats). 

Cabin is very quiet, comfortable and upscale. Lots of cupholders and storage, including two coolers in the floor in the back. 

The engine is powerful, easy to safely merge, pass etc. Easily handled my camper. 

Overall amazing truck! I have only owned smaller trucks (1998 Ranger, 1996 Ranger, 2001 S10, 2002 S10 and 1984 Mazda B2000) so I was worried about parking it, driving around in traffic (narrow streets etc), but it is a breeze. There are sensors on the front and back to help along with a very detailed back up camera. 

CONS:
Gas mileage as expected, but not as bad as I imagined (15-18 mpg). I must say I do have the off road tires installed by the prior owner so obviously that is a big factor. Not really complaining, just worst than my little 2012 civic lol. Duh right?!? 

SiriusXM radio was initially AMAZING however since the trial period ended and I chose not to continue it ($16.99 a month), I have been getting letters from SiriusXM with deals and promotionals ever since at least twice a week. Kind of annoying. I downloaded free apps on phone, sync on bluetooth and listen for free =) If you want it, let it lapse and not respond at first and you will get promotions for 6 months free etc afterwards.

***
I have had the truck for about 5k miles so far. I will update after a year. Good luck out there!

ram,1500-classic,2019,Juan, 08/15/2019,Checks every box,5,"I wanted to all of my consolidated my vehicles into one that does it all. Needed to combine the utility if my old avalanche with the performance of my focus ST while still being able to haul the kids around comfortably. I looked at the new Sierra and Silverado and was impressed with the performance but not the price. Finally settled on the RAM 1500. It has more space than I'll ever need, good tow rating and that HEMI really gets going when you put your foot down. I average about 20 MPG as long as I drive sensibly the the ride quality is amazing. It did everything the new Sierra offered for less. Strongly recommend the 8.4 in infotainment system.

*12k mile update*  I've noticed a little vibration coming from the driver and front passenger door panels while listening to music with heavy base. The front passenger window control panel pops out weirdly easily and may be to blame. Android auto is awesome when it works but I've had more than a few days where it refuses to connect to my phone. The Uconnect is a neat gimmick but that also stops working quite often (app disconnects you).  Lastly there seems to be a little rust forming on the lip around the right fog light of my chrome bumper. That last one is ridiculous and I'll have them look at it next week during my inspection. I don't regret buying the truck, I'll continue to love my time with it. Hopefully the rust issue is addressed and doesn't come back for many years

ram,1500-classic,2019,Nick, 01/20/2019,Dodge’s best kept secret,5,"Just bought a Classic 1500. This last run of the 4th gen 1500 will go down as Dodges best kept secret. They are giving these trucks away at a steal of a price. The Big Horn I got is equipped just perfectly for a truck. I don’t need a crazy fancy truck with tons of extras that jack the price north of 50K. I think the gen 4 1500 is the best looking Dodge ever made, I’m not a fan of the looks of the gen 5. Plus, this last run of trucks is made in USA!

ram,1500-classic,2019,Rob T, 02/21/2019,It's a steal! Classic Lone Star Silver edition,5,"18 months and 17000 miles now.  Not a single complaint, nor a single problem to report.  It did feel like there was a hard downshift as I drove it through a parking lot last week so I will keep a look out for further development on that.  I’ve taken it in for 2 oil changes and two tire rotations.  It has been an easy truck to live with on a day to day basis, easy to park and easy to maneuver.  I still think the front end sensor is too sensitive, giving a full alert when I am still nearly 18 inches away from cars in the next parking stall. 

This is my second review after nearly 6 months of ownership.  I'm still averaging 18-19 mpg with about 60% interstate / 40% in town driving (Hemi with 3.92 axle).  I'm still very pleased overall with everything this trim level has to offer and the suspension continues to impress me; you don't need to put sand bags in the bed to give it a smooth ride and absorbs bumps in the road without any jitters. The park assist alarms are a nice feature but I think the settings are too conservative when pulling into tight parking spaces making way too much racket when I'm still a foot away from the other car.    The dual zone auto A/C never needs to be fussed with - I keep it set at 70 in Texas and works perfectly for me.  The steering is tight and goes exactly where I turn the wheel.    The seats are not as comfortable as the F-150 but still very supportive and able to take long trips without fatigue.  The sound of the Hemi makes up for the seats and, in my opinion, the body style looks better than either the Ford or Chevy.  Overall it is way more truck than the F150 Ecoboost at a lower purchase price and very little, if any, sacrifice in real world fuel economy.  

One year in, I've driven just over 12000 miles and averaged 18 mpg using the Eco mode, driving about 60% highway miles.  I’ve had zero problems, and zero out of pocket maintenance costs so far.   Tomball, TX Dodge dealer threw in 2 free oil changes and 2 free tire rotations. The suspension on this truck is still firm with no squeaks or rattles.  It feels firmly planted on the pavement in the rear with the coil suspension and the steering wheel feels light and accurate, it goes right where it's pointed without any play in the wheel.   The interior is straightforward and the UConnect system with Apple Play is intuitive and easy to understand.  Road noise is near non-existent with a slight rumble from the engine when accelerating.  My two complaints continue to be the step up bar; and the front bumper sensor alarms.

This truck so smooth and quite even at highway speeds. It handles fantastic and has plenty of go with the 395 HP Hemi V8 and a great exhaust note. THESE Classics are a steal. I bought mine for $34.5K(Sticker was $49,451) out the door. They even threw in an additional year of Bumper to Bumper warranty, Now I have 48 months instead of 36 months. They also included 4 years free maintenance and oil changes.

Def would recommend dirt tires, even for strickly road use, second thing, no bluetooth in the stereo. But i did buy the express trim package, so i understand not having bluetooth. All in all, i have never fell in love with a vehicle faster.

ram,1500-classic,2019,R. D., 12/31/2019,This is a basic no frills 4x4 truck!,5,"I did not want the latest electronics, nor did I need the big v8 engine. I wanted a truck that would last well into my retirement that would do chores and haul things like boats, travel trailers and the occasional load of fresh firewood. This trucks bells and fancy whistles are a radio that is blue tooth, cruse control and it tells me if my air pressure is low and how much longer until a oil change. I know how to roll down my own windows by the hand crank and that is good enough. After six months of ownership I'm very satisfied with the 6 cylinders performance. In Colorado we can have all four seasons in the same week, and this truck has been through then all. I like the 8 foot bed. The only cons are with the bench seat it is a bit tall to get into, but I put side step on the truck and it is just fine. And in the snow with stock tires the truck runs through it very good, but the ice underneath the snow gets a bit tricky so you do need to use the 4x4 to start off. However, this is not a huge problem it is a weight to empty box issue and once you put it in 4x4 you would think you were in a jeep.lol

As far as the truck overall it's super quiet, and the ride is really nice for a truck. Interior is comfortable for the exception of reaching for controls. A little far from the driver especially while driving. Cant believe they did not put radio controls on the steering wheel. Heater is a little week until you've driven 15 or twenty miles. Also a little slippage in the shifting. Going to talk to the dealer about it. My truck is a 1500 Classic crew cab 5.7LT  (did not show option for that above).

ram,1500-classic,2019,Paul W, 10/10/2019,Chrysler still has quality control problems,4,"I bought the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic because the rebates and discounts were so generous making it a bargain. Once I got it home the elation began to wane quickly. The paint job had several odd dull areas the size of golf balls so I had to buy wax and get to work immediately. Upon closer inspection I found many more flaws in the paint including hard pieces and bumps (I have the diamond black crystal). This truck was manufactured just 6 weeks before I drove it off the lot. What gets me is Chrysler has the nerve to charge extra for any color other than white and then serves you up a defective paint job. The truck comes with a spray in bed liner standard but Chrysler adds insult to injury by charging an extra $1,295 for the chrome package which for some strange reason deletes the bed liner. So now I have to go and pay someone more money to do it. The ride is somewhat mushy and bouncy, I would have preferred a more controlled experience. The interior is dated and with a sticker price of nearly $35,000 it doesn't even have a satellite radio. The huge center armrest jiggles and rattles too much. I have great concerns about the reliability over the long run. Hopefully I didn't make a mistake.

This truck will straight up get up and move like no v6 i have ever driven.  I was forced to stop on the freeway at night on a bend in the road. To secure cargo. My wife scared because vehicles are coming by at 70 plus miles an hour. When pulling out i was nervous. I stomped on it we hit 70 in mere seconds and had no issues getting out into traffic at speed. Never seen a v6 do that before. A year later 50k miles hasn't changed a bit. This is one hell of a truck. My other truck is a chevy 2500hd. First ever dodge and pretty impressed over all with the v6 truck. Not bad at all

I love how loaded it is with features, Love having all that power at my foot. I love my towing capacity. that’s the whole reason I purchased the truck. I have the 5.7 Hemi. 6’4-foot bed. Motor is equipped with E-Torque. Has a great exhaust note and is a smooth ride.  Night time visibility is ok. I changed out the Halogen bulbs for some quality BRIGHT LED’s and I can see much better at night now. There is not much about the truck I don’t like. So where is the real problem? When I carry more than 3 people. You get a DEEP droning hum. The sound is clearly coming from the intake of the motor. It gets so loud at times, you can’t hear others speaking. You can mitigate this issue slightly by activating the tow/haul feature. I have attempted to contact the dealer several times about this issue but I never receive a call back. I plan on calling a different dealer to see if I have a better response. Outside of this one issue. I have no other complaints about this truck. It hauls anything I have. Tows amazingly well with my 6X12 cargo trailer. Provides a nice quiet interior and I enjoy the active display and back up camera. Front and rear object detection and collision avoidance system.  It’s been a great truck.

I have had 3 issues with it since I purchased it, one was the tie rod end recall that Chrysler put out a few  years ago.  Had an exhaust manifold bolt break, fixed under warranty, and my heater blower motor died.  Easy fix there as well.  I own a lawncare/landscaping/snow plowing company.  This truck does everything for us.  We tow trailer's all summer long and then slap on snow plows during the winter season.  For the use and abuse we put this truck through, it is never in the shop!  Ram makes maintenance really easy on their trucks as well.  (Not sure how the diesel ones are for maintenance)  The interior layout is really nice and comfortable (even after plowing snow nonstop for 12 hours).  I can't say enough good about this truck!

The engine worked great, and pulled anything. There was an issue here and there, but when you put so many luxury features in a truck, little things are going to break. 
However, when my drivetrain broke, Chrysler refused to cover it under the warranty, even with the service records. The damage caused was so severe (more than $30k) that my insurance had to total the vehicle. Dealing with the warranty claims department took months, and they were useless. "

I have had no problems up to now and gas mileage is around 20MPG in the San Antonio metro area not BAD! I will buy this truck again. Interior looks amazing they did skimp on the very fine details but its almost unnoticeable. Good truck probably the best for money and value. 
ram,2500,2013,Habitual Dodge Cummins owner, 08/08/2018,2013 Ram Cummins SLT 4 dr. long bed,2,"Think long and hard before you buy this truck. I traded in my '02 model, similarly equipped, knowing that the older model would require some shop time, before long. It turned out that the new truck spent much more time in the shop than the old one ever did. High points are the refinements. The new 6.7L Cummins in the later Ram models are whisper-quiet at highway speeds. The new truck is much more stable. Gone is the death wobble that threatened the older models at higher speeds. Mileage is on par with the older, 12v Cummins in the Dodge Rams. Highway mileage regularly calculates above 20 mpg, with a best ever of 23.9,  driven at or below the speed limit on a round trip between Soldotna and Seward, AK. With a heavy trailer, right at the 17k lb. capacity of the truck, mileage dropped below 10 mpg on the same highway (a hilly, twisty highway). Here are the downsides: this truck has been in the shop for repair for three months, in the two and a half years that I've owned it, starting with a check engine light on the first drive home from the dealership. It was back and forth to their shop seven times, all for different problems, in the first nine months that I owned it, for a total of two months in that time period. I also replaced the water pump, myself, during that time. It has been replaced a second time, since then. The main exhaust emission components were all replaced twice. The rear differential failed, and was rebuilt. The heater fan quit working, and one dealer took two weeks to fix it, replacing the fuse box, at a cost to me of $1k. As soon as the warranty was out on the emissions system, I pulled it all off, and installed the biggest muffler I could buy. I like to be able to hear myself think. That cost $1,300 for materials and the programmer, not including my time to weld the exhaust and remove the problematic devices. Now, at 67,500 miles, the variable geometry turbo actuator has failed. The dealer first quoted me $2,800 for the device, which is in stock, and said they could drop it to as low as $1,950. Since the powertrain warranty ran out two months ago, this is my cost. I opted to mail the actuator to a repair place, at a cost of $500, and two weeks out of service. Again, not counting my labor. Speaking of the VGT, the exhaust brake is a nice feature that doesn't work like it should, with the automatic. It works best with a heavy trailer, but only if you are using the brakes. At highway speeds, the exhaust brake will slow you down to 55, then the torque converter unlocks, and the truck coasts at an idle. You get better compression braking naturally with the exhaust brake off, because the torque converter stays locked. You can make the exhaust brake work better by downshifting manually, but touching the throttle will leave you coasting when the torque converter unlocks, and the control for manually shifting barely works. The A/C quit working not long after they fixed the heater fan, and I haven't gotten it fixed, yet. One of the two USB ports does not work. The sheet metal on the body is thin, and both doors were already dinged when I bought it, at 20k miles, apparently by people pushing the doors, near the handle, to close them. The left third of the rearview mirror turns into the backup camera, which basically makes the mirror useless for backing up the truck, especially if it's dark. The truck is prone to understeer, and traction control is an unwelcome inconvenience that can't be turned completely off unless in four wheel drive, at a dead stop. It also leaves you with a considerable throttle lag, as the computer decides whether or not it can give the throttle input you desire. The value of the truck has declined steadily, since I bought it, and it is still barely worth what I owe on it. Summing it up, the truck fails in several of the categories which are the main reasons to buy a diesel pickup, including
 reliability, durability, and resale value. Good power, mileage, refinement, and work ability. The roomy interior is nice to sit in, even when the truck doesn't run.

ram,2500,2013,Ryan Tafoya, 03/24/2016,Good for a while,3,"I have been driving a 2013 2500 Ram with the Cummins engine. The truck now has 78,000 miles and other than high maintenance costs (oil change and fuel filters replacement $400) and only ok mileage (combined 18) it had been a good truck. I was recently involved in an accident that damaged the front passenger door and front fender  but still drivable. It's been in and out of the dealership four times for engine repairs. The engine quit and initial sensor was for the throttle valve. First they replaced the throttle valve and did an EGR service, after the DEF light kept coming on, they finally decided that the DEF pump and airbox had gone out. With these repairs, we are now sitting at $2500. Somehow, I suspect it will not end here. The problem is the emissions technology has not been perfected and the factory does not want to admit it. The pre DEF engines ran relatively trouble free for well over 100,000 miles. Unless you plan on hauling a lot of weight, stick with the gas engines for now.Update; at about 80,000 miles the fan ate the shroud and the water pump went out at the same time.  This also destroyed the radiator, repair bill $3000. The water pump went out the first time at 40,000 (under warranty). A week later the fan ate the shroud again, the dealership covered the repairs this time but the truck was down for almost a month between both repairs. Now at 85,000 miles and things are going ok. Now at 115,000 and no new problems to speak of. Engine runs good and interior has no rattles. Update; at 125,000 the right rear seal, soaking the brakes in oil. So, new seal and new rear brakes. Engine running strong, transmission has been trouble free and interior quiet. Mileage averages about 17.5 now. I was hit while out of town, truck has been totaled, 145,000 miles.

ram,2500,2013,Ethan Holmes, 08/13/2017,60K FOR TIN & PLASTIC,2,"Aside from the motor, which is a Cummins 6.7 powerhouse, this truck is a tin and plastic, over-priced, dysfunctional piece of garbage. The constant dinging of warning messages from the bug-ridden computers that end up meaning little while scaring the bejabbers out of the driver is one of the biggest headaches of owning this vehicle. The now infamous 'Uconnect' system is so corrupt and full of bugs that it should aptly be re-named 'Disconnect'. The fact that FCA's response was 'go buy a new truck because we fixed the problems but you're not getting the software fixes' was particularly enraging. The batteries failed withing 26 months, the running board covers are cheap plastic and have been disintegrating since day one and are as slick as black ice when wet. The entire truck is nothing but thin plastic and even thinner metal that is easily dented by pushing on a malfunctioning door. I have a list of other things wrong with this piece of garbage as long as my arm and the truck is currently under several recalls, not the least of which is the catalytic converter. I don't see $60 in this truck let alone 60K.

ram,2500,2014,Eric, 11/09/2017,6.7 Cummins,4,"Actually, this is a Cummins 2500 Bighorn Megacab but there was no option to choose.  Good truck overall.  I bought it a year ago with 105k miles on it.  The engine is STRONG and you'll be speeding down the road in no time if you're not careful.  My truck has always pulled to the right even after switching tires around and after an alignment but it brakes straight.  Rarely I have to shut it down to restart the infotainment system because it doesn't want to connect to my phone correctly.  The tranny, it's a 68RFE I believe, had to be rebuild but fortunately, was under a dealer 3 month warranty.  Apparently the previous owner did some heavy towing in the wrong gear and burned the clutches.  It's been good ever since the rebuild.  The tranny tends to hunt a bit and it wants to be in the highest gear possible all the time.  I'll be driving on a flat road at 35 mph in 5th gear at 900 rpm's.  This is fine I guess but even if you think of accelerating, even a little, the tranny will shift.  Something new to me, as I've never owned such a new vehicle, I guess the transmission ""depowers"" before it shifts.  To me, this sounds like tranny slippage but I was informed by the dealer that this is normal and is to help the tranny last longer.   My truck came with airbags on the rear axle and after my first pull of my 10k lb fifth wheel I can now see why.  The 5 link rear suspension makes for a very nice ride, even better than my old Duramax, but it sure squats under my trailer.  I need about 50lbs of air in my airbags to keep the suspension from bottoming out over ""whoops"" in the road.  (Not sure what else to call them.)  When flipping the outside mirrors up to tow, the up button no longer moves the mirror up.  Two major things that have happened since owning the truck other than the tranny thing, I've had to replace a NOx sensor which was $450 for the part alone.  Very easy to replace however, I found an aftermarket part for $117 but the electrical connectors didn't fit so I had to bite the bullet and buy a Mopar part, and I THINK I have a leaking exhaust manifold gasket because when heavily using the exhaust brake, I'll get a high pitched shrill.  After some research I found that others have had this problem too and it's a $400 or less fix at my local diesel shop.  I also wish the steering wheel could go a bit higher to fit my 6'3"" frame but it's not a big deal.  The center head rest on the rear seat is in the way when looking through the rear view mirror.   One thing that can be scary is that sometimes when I hit the throttle hard to sneak a left turn at a light or pull out into a busy street, the truck doesn't go!  Or rather, it's as if I leisurely pushed the gas pedal to go.  After maybe a second it will ""kick in"" and it will take off but man!  That moment can be scary.  For around $300 I can add a sensor to the throttle that fools the truck into thinking it needs to go faster.  It's my opinion that this should be a recall for obvious reasons and the fact that there's an aftermarket device to remedy the problem which also means there's plenty of other people with the same problem.  For this reason I knocked the safety rating down to four stars.  THE GOOD:  This is a nice riding truck with very comfortable seats.  No leather in my truck so I only have the heated seats.  The dash and gauges are well designed and placed and I like how I can add various bar gauges electronically to different parts of the dash video screen.  The center console is laid out well other than the 4x4 knob gets hidden a bit behind the shifter lever when in drive.  I have the 8.4 Uconnect which is great and the cab is insulated well. The stereo works well and sounds good.  I added a sub for a better experience.  LOTS of room in the front and back seats.  The mega cab lacks the under floor storage boxes near the back seats but makes up for it behind the rear seats.  My
 truck was ""pre-plumbed"" with the manufacturers goose neck package and the Ram goose neck kit is good.  The paint seems to be good and show no signs of any problems.  Overall, I really like this truck and, for the most part, I feel safe and secure driving it and I look forward to many more years with it.

Plenty of power to pull my 10k lb toyhauler and 11 mpg when towing. Love the built in exhaust brake.  Very good ride with the 5 link coil suspension. Comfortable and quiet cab. My previous truck was a 2003 Ford F250 4x4 V-12 gasser that got 6mpg while pulling.

We thought we would buy a reliable truck to get me back and forth to Doctors, and sometimes it will not start. I have had this to the dealer over 35 times for over 9 different problems, and even the mechanic traded his in as he was having tire sensor problems etc. Did Dodge themselves write the A review?  Due to health issues, I can not take time to deal with a Lemon Law Attorney!!!"

ram,2500,2014,Jason, 09/09/2015,Great engine rest poor quality,2,"The truck has been in the shop 5 times already each time taking over five hours even for something as simple as an oil change.  Cruise control on button works only half the time.  Climate control makes noise.  Shifts hard.  But can tow 17k and still get 10mpg.  impressed me.  Exhaust brake works good but doesn't work at lower speeds. Ended up selling it and went back to a 1986 ford diesel that I converted into a cummins. Much happier now.

ram,2500,2014,Tim Smith, 05/10/2017,Holding up to everything,5,"Bought the base tradesman model with the upgraded electronics package making it more like an SLT on the interior. integrated brake controller is awesome and everything continues to work as it should. This was one of the first years with the spring suspension in the rear and it has held up to all towing and payload requirements without blinking. The ride quality is still a 3/4 ton but far superior to the other rams with springs in the rear. If you don't need the extra payload of the leafs then personally i would stick with the springs for daily ride quality. The only time i have seen the distance between my bed and tire gap shrink is with one of my 1950's era steel equipment trailers which is none too light in the hitch weight department.  overall tows well - nice and smooth - though if you live in a word of elevation changes my guess is you would be disapointed with high speed towing as the engine really needs to work at high speeds to get up hills and maintain a set speed.  It still does the job but it is working hard.  flat and mild elevation towing with no hassle. towing mirrors add great visibility - i can park this easier than my daily driver.  Factory tires are marginal. headlights dim. easily dents and scratches. mechanically rock solid. 4x4 low is awesome for heavy duty truck work.  stock front bumper accepts the powerwagon winch kit without modification. bought mine new in 2014 with solid factory incentives and i can still trade it in for more than i owe on it. even though i knew better i got suckered into adding extra warranties at the last minute - money wasted - the truck has had no issues despite being put through a great deal of abuse.  Makes my dad angry that my little gas engine can out tow his mid 00's diesel.

ram,2500,2014,Mike, 04/10/2018,This truck far out performs my 6.0L Ford,5,"Love this truck, pulls great, rides great, much better mileage then my previous trucks. Update April 2019  still no problems truck is good, but it does seem the computer flash recalls have degraded my gas mileage. Some of the plastic around the center console is soft and the chrome scratches off easy. The cruise control button you have to hit sometimes dozen our more time before it starts to work especially when its cold. After it finally comes on it will  work with no issues.  This truck is a diesel not sure why it says gas V8 at the top.

ram,2500,2014,Eric, 03/23/2018,Great Truck,4,"I've owned this truck for a little over a year now.  It's a Ram 2500 4x4 Big Horn Mega Cab with the Cummins and I bought it with around 106k miles.  Before I purchased the truck I was able to scroll through the electronic dash menu and find out a few things about how the truck was used before purchasing it.  I also bought it from the dealership that initially sold it and they knew the history and the person who owned it.  I then felt comfortable buying it.     THE GOOD:      I love the electronics the truck has especially the Uconnect infotainment system.  Mine came with the larger screen and an instrument cluster screen which allowed me to program what I wanted to appear on the screen.  There are also plenty of analog gauges which allowed me to program the screen to show things like turbo boost and tranny temps among others.  Mine didn't come with the Pioneer sound system but it still sounds good.  My phone connects flawlessly with the Uconnect system and I have no problem hearing others and they can hear me as well.  The new update is taking a bit of time to get used to.  Seems like there's a separate volume level for music, blue tooth music and phone calls.  I don't have the GPS on my system but for $400 I can add it.  I use my phone.  The ride is GREAT.  It's much smoother than any other 3/4 ton truck I've owned and I'm sure it's because of the 5 link rear suspension.  The mega cab offers tons of room but there's no floor storage like on the regular crew cab trucks.  There is, however, nice storage behind the rear seat.  Tons of room in the front seats too.  I'm 6'3"" and around 220 lbs and I fit fine anywhere in the truck.  Mine has the movable gas and brake pedal option which my wife likes.   The truck also pulls like there's no tomorrow.  It's very powerful and I like the exhaust brake and it seems to work better than the other manufacturer trucks of the same type.  Ram's goose neck ball works great.     THE BAD:     I had to replace the rear NoX sensor.  I did this easily myself but it was $450 for the part.  I tried ordering a cheaper one from Amazon but it wouldn't plug in correctly.  The fuel filters, there's two, are pricey at around $100 for the pair.  After the hassle of doing it myself and saving $100 I decided to have someone else do it next time.   The owner before me had airbags installed on the rear suspension.  I'm glad he did because my truck did some serious ""bouncing"" while pulling my 10k lb 5-wheel.  My older 2002 Duramax didn't do this.  I'm wondering if it's because of the new suspension design or maybe I need new shocks.  I'll be installing some before the camping season begins.  Inflating the airbags to around 50 lbs fixed the problem but lifted the rear of the truck up high enough to cause me some concern as to how close my bed rails were to the trailer.  I ended up flipping the trailer axles which made things much better.  Makes me wonder if newer trucks just have higher bed rails   The tranny must have been programmed for mileage because I can drive down a side street at 35 mph in 5th gear at 900 rpm.  This drives me crazy.  I prefer driving the truck in tow/haul mode but I'm not sure if it's good for the tranny to do that continually without a load.  The tranny also ""flares"" or ""de-powers"" between shifts in the upper gears.  Everyone I talk to, even online, says this is normal.  There are upgrades to reduce or eliminate this but it's costly so I'll just deal with it.  Also, the truck wants around 70 psi in the rear wheels.  This is absurd when not hauling something heavy.  I drive with 45 psi in the rear tires which causes a notice on my dash screen to warn me of low rear tire pressure.  I now think of it as a pre-driving tire check.  I ignore the amber warning light.  Also, when it got cold outside I noticed the heater fan squeaked a bit.    ***Update***  It's now 9-26-18 and the truck is still
 plugging away.  It's doing well however it's time for new tires.  That's about all I have to say about it.  No problems since last review other than the latest update on the infotainment system.  Now my iphone will sometimes connect automatically and other times I have to tell the infotainment system to accept a call of which it asked me to confirm if I wanted to take it via the truck system.  This is highly annoying.

ram,2500,2015,Steve Watson, 07/08/2016,Edmunds Needs To List ALL Models,4,"I don't have a Tradesman, but the Big Horn with the 6.4 liter Hemi wasn't listed. Overall rating is excellent. this is my 5th Ram having purchased my first, a 1500 in 2006. I have owned (3) 1500's, (1) 3500 and now the 2500. I balanced the cost of the diesel against the cost of the hemi, and found the latter to be the better deal. I pull my 38' 10k RV behind my truck with few issues and on occasion even put my HD Ultra in the bed while towing the RV. Wish I had bought the 8' bed vice the short bed....next time. Truck pulls fine on the open road, but will struggle a bit on steep inclines. The trailer brake system works great. Transmission is fine, but at times, will shift hard when rapid down shifting. I intend to have the dealer check it out at the 30k service. I love the email vehicle status updates I get via email from Ram on a monthly basis. Modern technology....Cabin is spacious and I find it better than the competitors offering the same trim level. Price is better also! Ram needs to dump Firestone. The factory tires don't wear well. If your looking for a heavy duty truck that also gets great gas mileage, you might want to look elsewhere. Just keep in mind, the 6.4 Hemi has all the balls you may need, but fuel economy suffers. 15-17 mpg on the highway at 72-75 mph, 7-10 mph pulling  the RV at 60-65mph. Cabin is well put together and comfortable. I have cloth, but the first thing I did was Scotch Guard it and continue to do so every 6 months or so....no stain issues. Seriously, this truck gets the job done at a price below the competition while offering the same quality of materials and workmanship. My wife loves driving it....that in itself says a lot about the Ram. (She drives a '17 Ford F150...).

ram,2500,2015,ltngdrvr, 03/23/2015,"2015 RAM Cummins, Great Truck, Always Room For Improvement Though",4,"Ordered my 2015 RAM 2500 Mega Cab Cummins, picked it up 02/09/15 and in the last 6 weeks have racked up over 10K miles. I traded in a 2012 F250 Crew Cab Long Bed PowerStroke that I had put over 200K on. So far I am really liking my RAM although there is room for improvement.My ford pulled better, even though both have the same torque at 800. I can only attribute this to the difference between the faster revving V8 vs the big inline 6 of the Cummins. If RAM made the 3.73 or 4.10 gear ratios optional in the Single Rear Wheel trucks over the 3.42 ratio, maybe it would match the ford's pulling abilities. That would probably hurt fuel economy empty. I have gotten as high as 21.7 MPG in the RAM."
ram,2500,2015,richard hough, 01/15/2016,Powerful beast with more than one Achilles heel!,3,"The power of the Hemi cannot be beat! The transmission over the first 5000 miles is iffy. The ride quality is better than my 2011 Ram, yet the noise inside the cab is worse. The quality of the interior materials is worse than previous years, as is the function of the radio system. It never ceases to amaze me how the price goes up year after year, even with the obvious cost cutting done by FCA! 2 years down the road more stuff breaks. I pulled the rear slider closed and the handle came off. Time will tell as the truck loses value! 2 years down the road yet another FCA recall and no fix! Happened with the steering issue on my 2011, now airbag on my 2015. May be time to rethink the Ram brand!

ram,2500,2015,Rick Kimbrell, 01/05/2017,The Federal Government had no clue with mandates,3,"First of all, this is my 3rd Ram diesel.  And, had 2 Ford Superduty diesels before.  From a comfort and interior room, hard to beat this truck.  The Laramie package has heated and cooled bucket seats, very comfortable in Texas weather.  You can move the drivers/passenger seat all the way back and not hit anyone knees who are sitting in the back seat.  The back seat will slightly recline if so desired.  Pulling power...hard to beat.  4x4 works great and will get you out of a jam as long as you have gotten rid of the stock tires they put on these trucks.  They are NOT off road tires.  This would be a great truck if the Federal Government had just left things well enough alone.  This wonderful Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system the Government mandated be on these truck.  I am ok with it being there.  But, if the system encounters an error, you get a check engine light and a message telling you that after 150 miles...your max speed is going to be 5mpg.  Do the Feds not understand that in middle American, SW America especially in many parts of Texas...you are 175 miles or more from a dealership.  I guess in Washington, there are dealerships within a 25 mile range.  Where in the world did they come up with such a mileage limitation.  So, beware if you live remotely and buy a diesel...you may end up stranded or limping along at 5mph for several hours.

My truck with the 6.4 Hemi wasn't listed so I used the Laramie as the model. My 5th Ram since 2006 including my 2008 dually. I just can't find a better truck for the money. I've seen other comments and really don't know what direction the authors come from. I've driven my truck through water that came up over the chrome step assists.....never had an issue. Back up camera works fine. Takes getting used to when all you have been doing is using mirrors in the past....but I have never had to make more than 3 attempts to hook up to my RV. Plenty of cabin room, has all the gadgets and doodads, (although I do miss the CD player), and it does any job asked of it. It's had a few recalls, but I think every damn car/truck in my neighborhood has too. It's towing capacity is a bit fuzzy. Ram's website says 15k other sites say 16k. Have had issues with tire vibrations at 70-75mph but the dealer is working to resolve. I finally got rid of the factory tires and put Cooper on/off road tires on. Resolved the issue for the most part. I have found that bad dealer service puts a bad taste in customers mouths and they post comments about their vehicles reflecting not so much the vehicle as the dealer. I have had a great dealer, Arrigo in SawGrass, FL, so I guess I'm lucky. I even drive there from FL to have it serviced. Great service advisor,Alana, who ENSURES customer satisfaction.
**** After driving from FL to Yellowstone...then to MA I learned that although the 6.4 Hemi is a strong engine, it doesn't like pulling 10k in RV weight up steep hills. Lots of downshifting and high RPM' s. If I had to do it again, I would go back to the 3500 diesel dually I owned. Likely will go to the 3500 again but not the dually. You just need the torque to pull heavy trailers. The built in Jake brake is great. Works well but still puts a strain on the engine on steep declines. Despite this, I'm still a Ram fan.

ram,2500,2015,Mike, 11/29/2015,Awesome Truck,5,"I have owned several trucks.  FORD, CHEVY and DODGE.  By far the best purchase I have ever made.  RAM hit the nail on the head with this truck.  I wasn't sure about owning a diesel with DEF fluid, but with the fuel mileage I get I have no problem with it.  It only consumes DEF fluid when I pull and it doesn't go through that much.  When empty I don't use any.  Big advantage to Ram is there is a gauge so you see your level of DEF fluid vs dummy lights on Ford and Chevy. And to fill the DEF tank is right next to the fuel.  Chevy you have to pop the hood to fill the DEF tank.  The diesel is amazing, huge amounts of torque when pulling and the fuel mileage is crazy.  Empty I get about 23mpg Hwy and 18 in town.  Pulling a 10K trailer 75 mph I get 13 and it doesn't slow down for any hill or mountain.  Just set the cruise and go.  Reliability is standard Cummins reputation.  Diesel still require the maintenance, if you ignore it you will pay for it.  I went with Ram Cummins because of the issues with Duramax eat injectors and Powerstrokes have had issues in the past and Ford Dealerships are garbage.

The Gas mileage is horrible average 8-10 MPG. The tires are worn out. I have owned several Ram trucks and will never buy one again. I am selling/trading mine as soon as the dealer replaces the motor. After the repair due to the low resale value I have been unable to sell the truck. My truck now has around 29000 miles. I am less satisfied than I was. I do NOT recommend this vehicle. I now have a small older truck i drive, and only use this one when i have to. I DO NOT RECOMENT THIS. Update at 31000 miles the transmission had to be replaced. Warranty covered everything.i now get slightly better fuel mileage. The truck has been painfully to own. I use the truck as little as possible. It has been a huge dissapointment. Update I went into the dealer to trade the truck in they offered me a ridiculously low price based on its history so because the truck had all these problems I don't have a clean vehicle Report I have a list of repairs it works okay now I still hate the radio and how it functions it is very annoying but I'm stuck with the truck until I'm willing to take a very low price to trade it in

ram,2500,2015,ros mell, 09/22/2016,Luxury car on steriods,2,"Condensed version. The cumbersome ""Thing"" doesn't know what it is.   Decked out like a luxury car with oversized trunk pretending to be a truck?   It's an over priced glitzy ""looker"" and that's about it.   At around $52,000 I guess it's gotta be something?  Thought I could live with it or get used to it.  After around a year of owning, I actually hate getting into it trying to use or driving it.  Pain to get everything into and out of because of the height.  Even people, using wheel to wheel side steps.  Cargo?  Right?  Too high up to be practical for loading and unloading most anything.  Might be okay for towing something with 6.4L Hemi engine?  But?  Isn't the truck bed meant to carry materials eliminating the need to use trailers most of the time?  The layout stinks for use as a truck inside and out.  Touch screen crap, steering controls or voice commands are not practical or laid out well.  CD player hidden in center console?  Annoying chrome handle on center console glares sunlight in eyes while driving.  What's practical?  Not much to me for either driver or passenger use.  Turning steering wheel sometimes turns stations, volume or dash settings from one thing to another by rubbing up against hands, fingers or legs.  Self dimming rear view mirror too impractical especially with rear tinted windows. - Throws off perspective for me.  Climate control blower sounds like jet engine - but blows poorly.  Cruise control ""on"" function blanks out digital speed indicator when first turned on is nerve wracking when setting speed.  ECO mode is about worthless.  Rarely works.  Had checked.  Response?  ""It's okay, you must have lead foot."" - Um, it's posted 55 mph off my driveway.  Only time ECO comes on is downhill or coming to a halt.  Worthless for highway cruising.  4x4 with factory supplied HT's, (Highway Tires) makes little to no sense for most off road applications. Or, even driving in sand or snow in 4 low.   Changed mfg HT tires at 3000 miles to AT's.  Better.  Help/support/loyalty?  Dealers within 100 miles around here are mostly useless for anything.  Tire pressure is around 60 psi front 80 psi rear TPMS setting is too high for normal unloaded driving and is supposedly adjustable by dealer - by ones who know what they are doing.   None here do.  Changed oil when asked to adjust tire pressure.  Check everything else but headlight alignment when stating poor nighttime visibility.  At another dealer?  Had truck for most of day and didn't do anything when high beams wouldn't come on. The closest dealer?  Blew up an engine by putting wrong oil filter on someone else's vehicle among other things.  Trust them?  Not today or tomorrow.  As of right now the vehicle is worth around $39,000 - from $52,000!  Depreciated that much already and can't even use it for normal intended purposes as general purpose P/U?  Am keeping ""it"" for now to remind myself not to buy another over priced off scale impractical  luxury car masquerading as a truck until the time is right to buy a real and more practical vehicle - to use as a general purpose pickup truck.  Also, according to all I've read, you cannot now put a snow plow on half ton trucks, just 2500's and up.  Even then, the 1500's or half tons are as gargantuan as the 2500's.  Sometimes a person can't win for losing?   Guess I'm out of luck finding a real truck until the newest soccer mom truck fad dies off?  Until then, it's sitting until something more practical comes along or it lays an egg.  Just like Ram did?  Ticked off?  Fill in the blanks?  Finally and very thankfully got rid of it to someone else who could hopefully use it - or didn't know better?

The dealership say that all the 8 nut systems are hard to get the nuts off and on and that this has been like that for many years. Working with aircraft and auto parts, I know that this is either defective parts or poor maintenance by over tightening with impact tools rather than using a torque wrench as they should do. And to replace those nuts, it cost $8-10 per nut and about the same for the studs. I have had to have  my catalytic converter, my DEF pump and had my computer reprogrammed many time for a number of issues. I think that this should be classified as a lemon."

Ive owned nothing hut ram trucks and all the same issue so this time i go out and buy a nice 2015 2500 with about 75,000 on it and sure enough in no time at all the truck starts rotting out at the wheel wells like normal. I am extremely displeased that a $45,000+ truck will rust out in 5 years, i mean come one, 5 years. After this experience i am not sure i will own another dodge ram again. Truck runs and drives great with no issues, plenty of power and great mileage for what it is. "
ram,2500,2016,Jason, 03/25/2016,Upgraded from a Tundra,5,"6.7 Diesel Black Appearance Group.  Basically I will compare my last truck (2010 Tundra 5.7 Rock Warrior 4x4) to this one.  My family camps a lot.  I have a 9000# camper.  My Tundra pulled it very well.  For a 1/2 ton truck it's amazing.  Great brakes, amazing power, and great comfort.  With all that said it is NOT a heavy duty truck!!  I originally purchased a 1/2 ton truck because it was a daily driver and figured a 3/4 or 1 ton truck might be too much as a daily driver.  I could not have been more wrong.  After 5 camping seasons towing with my Tundra and filling up every 120 miles (I got 7.5 mpg) I had enough.  I have always wanted a diesel due to obvious reasons; towing/hauling, efficiency, stability, and the pure idea of having a diesel truck.  My father has a 2012 F-350 6.7, so I borrowed it for a long trip.  About 10 minutes into the trip I knew the Tundra was gone.  

I drove them all.  In my opinion the Ram 2500 was by far the best decision for me as a daily driver.  The 3/4 ton has ridiculous towing (17,000+) and the available payload is way more then I would use.  It's the only 3/4 ton that has coil rear 5-link system.  Which promotes a fantastic ride for a HD truck.  The ride is solid, sturdy, and enjoyable.  It handles very well for nearly an 8000# truck.  For those of you who are...um.. vertically challenged, may have a difficult time getting into it.  It will be a more of a jump.  I'm 6'4"" and I slide right in, however, my wife 5'4"", has to climb in - but she loves the truck!  Once you get inside you will be amazed on how refined it is.  Everything inside the cabin looks high quality and well made.  The conveniences included rival most luxury SUVs.  

Performance wise it will scoot.  The nasty torque will put you in your seat, but it is the slowest out of the big 3 from a dead stop.  Once you are moving (say 20-30) and you hammer it - they all are fairly close.  It shifts quite a bit sooner than the Chevy and Ford.  The Ram will shift just before 3,000rpm, whereas the others will shift closer to 3500-4000 on a wide-open throttle acceleration.  But I didn't purchase this for drag racing, I bought it for straight up towing.  With all the torque available at 1600rpm it does it extremely well and with very little effort.    

Fuel economy for this 8000# beast is beyond amazing.  My Tundra averaged 14.5-15 per tank to and from work.  I have over 2000 miles on my Ram; basically 4 tanks.  So far each tank has been; 19.2, 18.6, 18.5, and currently I'm sitting at 18.8 with about another 100 miles until I fill up again.  I take the same way to and from work everyday.  Yes, I have a boring daily routine.  I live in central Ohio - the elevation is around 900ft (for those of you that need to know if the mpg is at sea level or in the clouds).  PS - I have, and will keep, all the emission.  I'm sure I will change my mind in a few months, but for now I'm happy with the sound/performance/mpgs.

Granted this entire review is based on a couple thousand miles.  Rest assure I will update after I have an entire year of camping under my belt.

ram,2500,2016,Hank Stone, 04/12/2016,Luxury in a Limited,5,"WOW! I purchased a 2016 RAM 2500 Limited 4x4 with the 6.7 Cummins to pull my Airstream.  This truck came with everything but a stripper pole!
Unbelievably comfortable.  Test drove the F250 first then the RAM.  Once the wife sat in the RAM and we took it for a test drive it was over.  The comfort blows
the Ford away.  The truck has 2,000 miles already with the Airstream behind it.  Going down 8% grades in Western N.C. is worry free with that exhaust brake.
Can't say enough about this truck.  Look forward to many more fun trips!

ram,2500,2016,John Williams, 07/05/2016,Great Truck!!!!!,5,"I'm writing this review because my 2016 RAM 2500/ 6.7 Laramie 4x4 is a Beast!  I custom ordered this truck and man did everything I got on this truck deliver. A month after getting my truck I went to Big Bear after a major snow fall and my truck handled well in 4x4H in the snow. My truck started well in 0 degree weather and every thing worked after driving in 0 degree weather. Next, two months later I went driving in the desert and once again my truck handled well on very rocky and bumpy roads like a champ. I have driven on the beach, in canyons, through water and my truck gets the job done. I just towed my 9,800lbs travel trailer and my truck towed well and braked well. I feel there are two downfalls with this truck; one is the limited turn radius of the truck. The turn radius isn't bad but the truck is hard to park in parking spots. Also the rear air vents provide very limited air in my crew cab. With those small issues stated, the interior of the truck is great. The storage in the rear passenger area is outstanding. I plan to have this truck for a while. Good job RAM!!!!!!!

ram,2500,2016,David, 03/01/2016,6.7 Ram 2500 Laramie with Black Appearance Package,5,"Sold my toy hauler and had no need for my 2012 F350 with 8' bed. Had a few problems with the ford and after owning a 2005 dodge 2500 decided to give Ram a chance. I will admit I do miss the tailgate step, this is my only complaint. This truck has almost as much technology as the wife's luxury SUV. This is my daily driver and no problems with mirrors if you set them up correctly. With the 6.7 Cummins 370HP/800 TQ and 3.42 rear axle ratio I get 21 mpg at 70 mph and my average with all driving is 17.8 mpg. I can pull my #14,000 trailer without a strain. So if you have to tow and need a comfortable daily driver go test drive a new ram. Since I 1st did this review the only thing I have added is a bestsop trek step. Works great for stepping up and down in a high truck!

ram,2500,2016,brian cook, 11/26/2015,MY 2016 RAM LARAMIE IS AWESOME!!!,5,"I bought my first ram laramie in new in 2004. I kept the truck until I traded it off in 2011 for another ram 2500 and it never had anything go wrong with it. The only time it was in the shop was for regular maintenance, It was always reliable. My 2011 was also a great truck.  Same story as the 2004, always reliable and never had an issue except for the suspension was a little rough. I traded it in on a chevy in 2014 (HORRIBLE MISTAKE!). Within a year the transmission went out and then the oil pump!!! Unbelievable! Maybe it was a lemon, I don't know but I will never buy another chevy again. (Also in 2010 I bought a new Camaro and it was in the shop for an oil leak within 10,000 miles). I then just recently traded off my chevy on a 2016 Ram 2500 Laramie and love it! The truck is extremely nice inside and out and drives fantastic compared to the older Dodge Rams that I've had.  Or any other truck that I've owned for that matter (Ford, Chevy). I would suggest to anyone looking into buying a new truck to test drive the new Ram! I never write reviews but after reading the negative one on here I had to post my feelings about the Ram. 

UPDATE; 
As of 5/30/2016 I would not change anything about my first review. The truck is awesome!

ram,2500,2016,Slick, 08/17/2016,Former Ford fanboy says... WELL DONE RAM!,4,"I was looking to replace my 2k Super Duty V10 4x4 supercab with a crew cab to give the dog more room, and fewer repair projects for me.  After getting frustrated with the local Ford dealers, started looking at Ram.  Spoke with several neighbors and co-workers who had made the switch from Ford to Ram & were extremely happy with the reliability & value of the Ram.  I had an extremely pleasant buying experience.  I did not want (to pay for) a loaded model.  I was able to find pretty much exactly what I wanted.  I bought a '16 2500 Heavy Duty crew cab short bed 4x4 with the 6.4L gasser & 4.10 gears in the Tradesman trim level (not a Power Wagon).  It's optioned almost to the SLT level with the chrome appearance package, preferred equipment package, UConnect 5.0, 4.10 gears, anti-spin differencial, shift-on-the-fly 4x4, park sense/park view, power trailer tow mirrors, and LED bed lights.    The ride is nice, albeit a bit stiff... but that's mainly a function of running 80 psi in the tires.  I'm amazed at how quiet the cabin is.  Being a base model, there are plenty of hard plastics in the cabin... but so far (fingers crossed), no squeaks or rattles... & it seems well put-together.  I wish it had a telescoping steering wheel, and the brake pedal sits a bit high for my foot.  I'll get used to it tho.  The seats seem quite comfortable... even the back seats.  The cylinder deactivation is imperceptible, tho at low speed/rpm, it will chug a little, on occasion.  The shift points (of the transmission) seem a bit off, even with the 4.10s, but all work smoothly.  It just seems like it's easy to catch the transmission off-guard pretty regularly...  a common occurrence in newer cars/trucks with 6-10 cogs in the trans...  it's tuned for mileage.   I'm getting around 11-13 mpg in town & 17-18 mpg on the highway.   No complaints there.  I'm still in the break-in phase, so no towing yet.  Overall, I'm a happy camper!

ram,2500,2016,Mountain Man, 12/12/2016,2016 Ram Mega Cab Diesel,5,"Purchased this truck a couple of months ago.  I live in Colorado and I spend a lot of time crossing the mountains in really rough storms.  More than once I have found myself being the only vehicle on the road able to handle the snow and ice.  The traction control is superb and the Cummins engine is amazing.  I should also mention how comfortable it is to drive.  The interior is really nice, especially with the saddle leather and all the bells and whistles that keep me comfortable in the worst conditions.  I've owned a lot of vehicles over the years, but not one of them can compare with this truck.  If you are looking for a vehicle that can handle the worst weather in the USA and keep you comfortable the entire time, then this is the truck for you.  I'm not a ""brand loyal"" guy, so when I was looking for a truck I looked at Ram, Ford and GMC.  At the end of the day the Ram won hands down.  The Mega Cab is very comfortable and the back seat is amazing for my kids.  Best truck on the market in my opinion.  Take it for a long test drive before you buy anything else.

ram,2500,2016,Uncle Jessie, 01/04/2017,"Tranny issues, lots of recalls",3,"Transmission went out at 5300 miles. Would have killed us if we'd been on the interstate. Luckily, it died near the house and reverse still worked enough to get us home. Truck just stopped, transmission by-passed Drive and went to 'Tow' mode and got stuck in 4th gear, unable to move forward. The transmission is just all messed up, after it sat a day it would drive forward about 50 feet and then go back into tow mode and would not go forward again; then gear changes were 'violent' and the truck would just jump when it managed to change gears. Love the truck and it was everything I wanted up to this point but 5300 miles and the tranny's gone?? 
Update: Got the transmission fixed at one of the top rated dealerships fairly close to the house and I've had no issues with it since; however, it doesn't go quite like it originally did; a little slower to change gears and get up to speed. We've taken it on a couple of long distance trips and it's been fine and I really don't have any more complaints about it. I use the truck to tow logs for my little sawmill and it does a good job. I also tow the occasional boat and trailer for other things and love the tow-ability and ease of controls. The original Firestone tires were advertised as 'off road' but they certainly are not and barely grip on an uphill incline when the truck is towing or has a load; however, they do ride good on the open road. 
Overall, I'm pretty happy with the truck now that the tranny problem seems to have been rectified and pleased with the warranty work although I did have to pay a little extra to have the truck towed to the dealership of my choice to do the repair work since the two closer dealerships have horrible service departments. Definitely worth paying a little extra to get the work done right the first time, though.
Another update: the part for the transmission (solenoid) was replaced with the same faulty one. Since then I have had it replaced with a newer version and at 14k miles all has been OK. Another recall came about- the truck may jump out of PARK. I got that one taken care of under warranty. Another recall just came out about the tailgate latch coming loose. So far it's been a typical 'Dodge' as far as initial quality (there is none).
It gets about 18.5-20 MPG on the interstate and about the same as everyday driving so I'm happy with fuel mileage. I think that is great for a 6.4 L gas engine. Other than the transmission issue and an unidentifiable wheel noise, it's been great. As a family we really like the Ram even with all the issues we've had so far. It gets decent fuel economy considering the beefy engine, it's very comfortable and roomy and it tows great.
Another update: got another recall about a steering bolt being the wrong type that may come loose and lose control of steering. I believe this is the fourth different recall.  Again, pep and pick-up not what it was before the tranny issue and gas mileage suffering these days.  We drive it a lot for family outings though because it is so comfortable and the kids/grandkids love the space and ride quality. Even with all the issues, it's still a great truck and, to be honest, we hear just as much complaints with other makes. Having been a Dodge/Ram owner for decades, I'm used to the quality being a little sub-par to be honest but buying a brand new truck and paying what you have to pay these days - you should get a better quality vehicle for the price.
Update 10/9/2019 - No further issues with the transmission. Power and fuel economy not what it was before all the trouble but still a really comfortable ride and still love how it tows - best towing vehicle I've ever owned. Still has a couple of open re-calls, one of which has no resolution at this time so waiting for a fix for that one before I take it in for the other ones. I've got about 28,000 miles on it and the Firestones are shot - soft rubber
 makes for a good ride but short life span.  Definitely will not put Firestones back on it due to wear and lack of off road traction in these 'all terrain' tires. All said the family loves this truck. I should clarify one thing, this is not a Power-Wagon as it says in the description but it was the only choice for the model and engine I have. It is four wheel drive with limited slip and it does a great job of getting in and out or rough areas even with what I would call 'road' tires. If it had better traction tires I think it would be nearly unstoppable off pavement.
Update 4/9/2020: No problem with the truck since the last update. Driving it more and more and love it. Very comfortable, great power to get on the road and up to speed. Great for towing. The ride quality is so good in this truck compared to all the other trucks I've owned. Family loves it, plenty of room for all of us, comfortable and most importantly to me, plenty of room for this 300 pound 6'2"" guy.
Update: 10/12/2020 - still all good after those initial poor spots; it's an all purpose truck - work, play, family.

ram,2500,2016,Chris, 06/05/2017,Tranny sha and shudder,3,"This is my 9th Ram since the body style change in 02.  A mix of 1500's, 2500's gas and diesel.  From day one this truck has had a shudder or shake at start under throttle until it shifts out of first.  It is a longbed diesel 2500 crew cab.   Dealer one immediately replaced the drive shaft but I don't know if it was both sections or just one (and maybe none).  DIdn't fix the issue and how can they give it back to me not realizing it's not fixed?  Dealer two, and the one I purched the truck from,  could find no repair although admitting it has a shudder.  They said another new truck on the lot did the same thing.  They blamed it on the long double drive shaft and wasn't anything to worry about.  With 7k miles, it continues to shake and shudder at take off espcially obvious under accerlation.  The dealer said not to worry because it's covered for 100K.  What an ass.  These trucks are supposed to good for a bunch more miles thatn 100K.  I've spoken to a couple guys that have this issue and they said Ram can't fix it.

ram,2500,2016,Justin Embrey, 05/23/2018,2017 Power Wagon Worst Vehicle I have ever owned.,2,"As most shoppers would be when I bought this truck I was very happy with the way it looked and drove when it was brand new. Soon after buying the truck i began having issue with the Electronic throttle control (Less than 5000 miles). It went to the dealership 3 times over about 3 months and still occasionally says it needs to be serviced. There has been 3 recalls on it to date one of which the parts are not currently available to repair it.  The paint chips off of the truck with the slightest sign of something rubbing up against it besides a cotton cloth. The hood and body has rust all over it in various spots from small rocks and even was chipped once by my hand hitting the tailgate. I was asked if I bought the paint protection plan for the vehicle and I asked them if they were kidding me, they clearly were not. Dodge knows they are doing less than a good job on the paint and overall dependability of these trucks. On to the next item, During the winter of 2017, the driver side window decided that it was going to break and no longer roll up or down. It went to the dealership yet again, They fixed the little tiny plastic part that had broken but ever since the window makes a grinding noise when going up or down and they said they can not find the issue. The latest issue that happened today 5/23/2018 is going down the interstate at 65 mph it decided to slam itself into 4 wheel drive and downshifted into 3rd gear. The truck jerked like I had slammed on the brakes and then would not shift past 4th gear regardless of the speed. When I stopped at the next red light the truck did not want to go as it was stuck in fourth gear and in limp mode according to the dealership. I have been a Ram owner for over 13 years and I can say that this experience has completely ruined my high regard for Dodge primarily for their lack of interest in resolving the issue. I have now started the process of making a lemon law claim on this vehicle as it has been into the dealership for repair almost 10 times in barely over a year. I will never buy another Ram truck for anything.

ram,2500,2016,Robert Barcelona, 04/08/2017,It's so RAM GOOD!,5,"I was looking to purchase a 1 year old RAM 2500 SLT with the 6.7 diesel engine. There is a ton of inventory out there and they all seem to have around 20,000 miles and were auction buys, then placed on the dealership lots. Very few dealers were actually willing to deal on these trucks. They all say... ""these trucks are highly sought after and there is very little room for discounts."" I wasn't about to spend $39,000-$43,000 dollars plus tax, license and DOC, on this truck. And I sure as heck didn't want to spend $50,000-$60,000 dollars on a new one. Call me cheap. After months of searching, researching, and dealing with multiple dealers, I found a 2013 RAM 2500 Tradesman with the 6.7 diesel with 18,000 miles. I didn't really want to look at it because I thought that it wouldn't have the features I wanted or needed. WOW was I wrong. Even on a 4 year old truck, there was very little difference in the interior features. Its exactly what I needed and the dealership that had it was ready to sell it. I purchased it for $35,500.00. I probably paid a bit more than I should have paid for it but even after tax, license, and DOC, I was still able to purchase a new camper shell and new rims and tires and still be under the amount of the SLT version. Ive had it a short time but I like it more thank my 2008 Ford F250 Diesel. If your looking at the SLT model, you may want to consider the Tradesman model and save some money.

The first day I drove the truck I lost acceleration on the highway and I had to pull off the road. The transmission had a problem with only 65 miles. I called Dealer and they told me to call Chrysler support and arrange for towing back to Dealer. Since I was more than 40 miles from the Dealer I would have to pay for the towing. BS! After a week at the Dealers service department I was told the transmission had to be replaced! Remember it only has 65 miles on the odometer. I demanded a new truck from the Dealer and they told me it's no possible since it was titled. The Customer Support was terrible, no one at the Dealer would return my calls, General Manager and Service Manager. I called the Attorney Generals Office and my Attorney. I'm still waiting for a resolution!!!

My 2016 Dodge Ram 2500 HEMI 6.4L (gas) truck has been in the shop several times in the past 12 months mostly because of MAJOR TRANSMISSION ISSUES and an entire list of other issues.

Dealers tell you the recommended oil change interval is 6000 miles between oil changes however, they do not tell you about oil consumption (based on Ram's ""Acceptable Oil Consumption"" maintenance notification - one quarter every 2,000 miles at over $10.00 per quart is within their accepable level). That only applies if you have less that 50,000 miles, after that, it's one quated for every 750miles. Love the truck - hate the oil consumption. Buyer beware - ask about any Dodge or Ram models there maintenance flier regarding ""ACCEPTABLE Oil Consumption"" - its the same.

I understand things wear out but you pay over 50k for a truck and this is all you get. When the breaks stated making noise at 30k the service guy tells me it a ram and sometimes they squeak! So i let it go, now I’m out 800 bucks because the driver caliper hung up and I’m out of warranty on the brakes. I will never own another Ram product, ever!!!!!!

ram,2500,2016,B Tanner, 05/14/2018,Ram 2500HD 6.4L,4,"2500 and 3500 HD trucks are work trucks so don't expect a ride like the 1500 series. I purchased to tow a 10,000 lb travel trailer and it does a great job in most terrain. Haven't been in big mountains yet and don't plan to. Currently looking to upgrade to Cummins diesel in the same level of rig.  Mine currently has the 6.4L and it is a strong engine. Two things I wish they would do: Add the 8 speed tranny to the 6.4 and set the cruise where it downshifts like the new 1500's do. It drops 3, sometimes 4 mph before it downshifts. Brothers new 1500 changes gears at a 1 mph change. Much smoother. Basically, I'm a Mopar guy from the get go having grown up in a Mopar dealership throughout the 50's and 60's.

ram,2500,2016,Randy, 11/15/2015,A piece of crap= POS,1,"To start with, my family has owned 7 dodge diesel's trucks so far. I will not buy another. I like driving my 1999 2500, owned it for 16 years and take it to drive unless I don't have a choice.  Would trade 2016, in if I wouldn't lose so much money. I get 21 mpg in my 1999; get 16 mpg in 2016.There's no interior lights for the front seat area. Have to pull over or passenger has to remove seat belt to read the map. Have to use the light in the back seat area. It doesn't have gas caps. It has Dumbo mirrors. They stick out way to far for normal use. It's very hard to see traffic in the mirrors. Real hard to change from fast lane to slow lane. Can't see cars in right lane. Mirror height to short. If you turn (90 degrees) the mirrors, you can see wide, but can't see cars. Have to use interior mirror for lane change. Has bug eyes mirrors on drivers side and passenger side. It's a pos. Tried to change out mirrors. Dealer had no knowledge on any kind of part swap. I'm 6'2"" and can't reach in to the bed of the truck without a ladder or lower tailgate. Still need ladder to get in bed. You have to buy steps to get in and out of the truck unless you have a 16"" vertical jump. Wife in high heels had to take off shoes to get in. Even with step, I hit my head on the overhead door opening. Not as tall as my 1999. Motor has a rev limiter. about 3200 rpm. Right when the motor is at full turbo, it cuts out. The exhaust brake button need to be relocated. You have to look at the bottom of the dash to engage. Eyes off the road like texting. Going to get a switch, for exhaust brake, to put on the gear shift lever. What does work--- I like the drink holder in the door. It's wired for easy towing. I like the six speed transmission. Wish I could put transmission in my 1999. Have to check. Over all I will retrofit an older truck before buying a new one. I've driven over 6 million miles in my life and this truck is dangerous to drive in traffic. Even on Freeways.  Overall.       Don’t buy this truck!

It only shows up when you have a big load on the truck.  when it does mess up you are stuck in 3rd gear.  Problem will not show up on a typical test drive.

ram,2500,2017,Justin Embrey, 05/23/2018,Worst Vehicle I have ever owned. Never again!!!,2,"As most shoppers would be when I bought this truck I was very happy with the way it looked and drove when it was brand new. Soon after buying the truck i began having issue with the Electronic throttle control (Less than 5000 miles). It went to the dealership 3 times over about 3 months and still occasionally says it needs to be serviced. There has been 3 recalls on it to date one of which the parts are not currently available to repair it. The paint chips off of the truck with the slightest sign of something rubbing up against it besides a cotton cloth. The hood and body has rust all over it in various spots from small rocks and even was chipped once by my hand hitting the tailgate. I was asked if I bought the paint protection plan for the vehicle and I asked them if they were kidding me, they clearly were not. Dodge knows they are doing less than a good job on the paint and overall dependability of these trucks. On to the next item, During the winter of 2017, the driver side window decided that it was going to break and no longer roll up or down. It went to the dealership yet again, They fixed the little tiny plastic part that had broken but ever since the window makes a grinding noise when going up or down and they said they can not find the issue. The latest issue that happened today 5/23/2018 is going down the interstate at 65 mph it decided to slam itself into 4 wheel drive and downshifted into 3rd gear. The truck jerked like I had slammed on the brakes and then would not shift past 4th gear regardless of the speed. When I stopped at the next red light the truck did not want to go as it was stuck in fourth gear and in limp mode according to the dealership. I have been a Ram owner for over 13 years and I can say that this experience has completely ruined my high regard for Dodge primarily for their lack of interest in resolving the issue. I have now started the process of making a lemon law claim on this vehicle as it has been into the dealership for repair almost 10 times in barely over a year. I will never buy another Ram truck for anything.

The number of recalls for this model are off the hook, especially the drag link issues...a spot weld is a fix??  Made in Mexico. Trans is starting to shift funny.

ram,2500,2018,Chris, 11/24/2018,Beast of a truck,5,"Be aware of your dealer's ethics in all aspects of your purchase.  ie.  Financing, your trade in, extras that you add on, the extended warranty  on diesels, and lock in a good interest rate.  Shop for financing before you shop for your truck.  Don't let the dealer rush you into anything, they like to wait late into the day, to then rush you into signing the papers quickly.  On to the truck.  The best vehicle I've ever bought.  Milage is awesome.  21 to 22.5 average.  Towing is unreal.  I can't even tell my boat is behind me.  Handling and ride is the best on any 2500 I've ever driven, mine or company vehicle.  I rarely reccomend a vehicle with 5 stars, but there isn't a 6 star rating, or I'd chose it on this one.

ram,2500,2018,Dentist775, 04/04/2019,RAM convert,5,"I used to be a Toyota truck junkie.  I was in the market for a new Tundra and decided I should do my due diligence and drive a Ford, Chevy and a RAM.  I was only impressed with the RAM 1500.  The dealer then suggested I test drive the Cummings 2500.  I was blown away with the build quality and the power of this engine.  I had always thought that Dodge made the worst trucks.  I was wrong.  I went back to Ford and drove the F-250 diesel and felt the interior was made of cheap materials for the price, but the ride was nice.  The same went for the Chevy 2500 I drove.  The power in the engine was great, but the cab felt small and had too many buttons on the dash. The cost for both of these vehicles similarly built (i.e., leather, heated seats, back up camera, etc) was outrageous.  I bought the Ram 2500 with the Laramie package, off road package, etc. and it was about $15-20K less than either of the other trucks.  I'm getting 19-21 MPG after about 5000 miles on the truck.  I know people are very passionate about their truck brands, but do yourself a favor before you buy your next truck and check out a RAM diesel pickup.  You will have a tough time justifying the cost and quality of a Ford or Chevy after you test drive this truck.

ram,2500,2018,JRG, 08/07/2018,The Cummins Makes the Ram,4,"There are only a few choices in HD trucks and none of them are bad. What the Ram brings to the table is a good platform with a fantastic engine and presented in a good value. Even the SLT has plenty of goodies. This is a work truck and a very capable, comfortable, reliable one. I know there are brand aficionados out there and that’s all good. I’d argue that the Ram is the best value in the HD truck segment, especially with the Cummins engine.

ram,2500,2018,Oilfield trucker, 04/20/2019,Absolutely love my Cummins,5,"I did a lot of research before I bought my 2018 ram 2500 with the Cummins and g56 6 speed manual. I’m not a ram fanboy so I looked at all the brands before I went with the ram. The reliability of the Cummins engine is really what sold me on it. I got the tradesman with the chrome package and it ended up being a lot cheaper than most half ton trucks! The diesels hold their value a lot better than gasoline engines and they just simply run longer. I haven’t regretted getting the ram once. The towing power it has is just ridiculous compared to a gasoline engine. UPDATE: 1 year later.... still just as happy with it as I was when it was new. My ONLY complaint is the location of the oil filter, you can’t get it out without dumping half the oil out of it. It’s not hard to get to through the passenger side fender well but you’ve just got to tilt the filter to one side. I guess it’s only a problem if you do your own oil changes"

ram,2500,2018,Jrod, 12/31/2018,Best heavy duty trail ready truck on the market,5,"I'm a Dodge/RAM fan and I have been since my dad gave me my first truck in 1998; a 1974 Dodge 3/4 4x4 pickup. Years and several brands later, I can honestly say that the new breed of trucks across all manufacturers are outstanding choices. I looked at the Ford Raptor, Tundra TRD Pro, and the Silverado with a Z71 package as potential suitors. I even considered the new ZR2 for a very, very brief moment. I wanted a truck with off road capabilities from the factory, with a nod towards locking diffs and other features that went beyond off-roading badges, skid plates, and mild trail tires. I don't need speed sensitive cruise control, lane departure warning systems, or blind spot warning lights, and the Power Wagon understands that. This is not an on-road pageant winner to address a comparison with my Tesla owning friends looking to carry home Ikea furniture.  My RAM has the proven trail features that I was looking for as a weekend getaway vehicle for my family of five as I get back into fishing, bike riding, and camping with my maturing kids. Aggressive styling and very good build quality, this truck exhibits excellent road qualities from peppy acceleration to great braking (the Wrangler DuraTracs take away a bit on the braking and quick maneuvering but I've adapted my driving style with no issues). The Power Wagon option has less payload than the other HD 3/4 trucks on the market but with the coil over springs in the rear and the Bilstein shocks, axle hop on expansion cracks with an empty bed is far less than the competitors. I consider this to be a half ton truck with HD axles. One area that needs improvement is with the headlights. Although they are projector beams, the light dispersion is poor and a truck of this size would do far better with HID or LED to light the way. I replaced my factory halogen bulbs with Sylvania Ultrastar bulbs but the improvements are not substantial. 
With a new body style and interior options coming for the RAM 2019 HD lineup, I expected tried and true electronics and mechanics in this truck and so far I have not been disappointed. Sure, I have a ways to go and with no off road time as of yet, it's a bit early to assess reliability. However, this generation of RAM HD has been around a while and I have no doubt that it will have minimal problems and years of great service.

16000 MILE UPDATE
Outstanding performance over the past 13 months and I highly recommend the vehicle for anyone in the market. The truck still drives rattle free and no electronic issues to report at all. Mechanically, I’ve not taken the truck in for repairs for the drivetrain or suspension but I’ve had a couple of small issues which are noted below. 

1. The RAM box on both sides have small clips that connect the mechanism to lock and unlock the lids electronically with the rest of the doors. Both sides have broken at least once and on two separate occasions. Nothing jammed under the lids or anything but it seems that the original clips were not that great. Hopefully, the replacements will last from here on out. 
2. One recall for the steering link and the possibility for it to loosen. The recall fix is to weld it together on the jam nut. Not a big deal really but it does mean that a front end alignment requires a bit more work if and when I need it. Thinking about it now, I should have skipped the recall. 

The Goodyear Duratracs that came factory are wearing very smoothly and evenly. I have noticed some increase in on center wandering but nothing excessive. Suspension still rides smooth for a 3/4 ton truck and with a cab full of kids and a weekend of camping gear, it rides even better. 

Headlights are still a disappointment even after I swapped the bulbs for Sylvania Ultras. One huge improvement I did was to install Rigid fog lights and spot lights to the factory location and what a difference. No issues with the headlights now.
 

Maintenance is a breeze and I do my own oil changes.  There is one grease fitting to be lubed every oil change so I had to buy a grease gun and a needle tip. Plan on a bit of a hassle to find the grease point if you elect to do it yourself and the service recommendation is every oil change. Unless you 4 wheel drive often, I’d say that this lube point could go every other oil change. 

I have no body issues and everything fits together very well. I did get a cracked windshield my first month of ownership and it took two months to get a factory replacement due to demand. However, it was fixed locally by a big glass company and I’ve had no issues other than the wait. 
I do give up some on road agility such as quick steering and hard braking but the off road ability is outstanding. I do not tow anything but the capabilities of this truck on the backroads is impressive. Look for a different vehicle option if towing is your intended purpose. 

My overall impression with this as my daily driver is above satisfactory and I highly recommend the Power Wagon.

ram,2500,2019,Kris, 04/02/2019,2019 Ram 2500HD Tradesman/Off-Road/Snow Chief.,5,"I bought the first Ram of it's kind to hit the state and so far so good. We are a Mopar family and this is my 3rd consecutive Ram since 2007 (born in raised in a GM home and that's who put food on the table). My last truck was a 2014 Ram 4x4 1500 5.7/8spd. QC Black Edition, so I have prior experience with the beauty that is the 8 speed. I'll preface this by stating I had been actively shopping (actually building) 2018 Tradesman similarly opted. I had went to 3 dealers to look, but just couldn't settle for the 6 speed transmission. The 6 speed and 373 is a terrible combo in Ram and the 4:10s are hard to find. I ended up seeing this exact model at the last dealer I went to. I while there aren't many rebates, I do get supplier pricing and qualified for 0% so I decided to take it for a drive. First thing I noticed is that the 1st 3 gears pulled substantially harder than the 6 speed. 4th, while low, seems to be a good mid-range gearing. On the highway this truck sings along at 70 moh and appx 1800rpm. I am averaging (only 200 miles on it) appx 15mpg, with mixed driving. I pull a boat,firewood,ATVs etc, and maybe a TT from time to time. I cannot justify the added expense of the CTD. FCA did right with this setup as the 8 speed can handle almost 600ftlbs of torque. I refuse to get caught up in this numbers game the makers are doing. The ride is quiet but firm, but it's a heavy duty. If you want plush, buy a car or spend $80k. I buy trucks for trucks. This setup is the perfect blend of function over form. The work grade vinyl is better feeling than most leathers and if I didn't tell you it was vinyl, you'd assume it was leather. This truck is carpet deleted, because who wants to clean carpet in a truck? If this gets dirty I can wipe the seats with a wet rag and spray out the floors. No more freaking out because mud was left in your $46k truck. Technology wise, I have no use for the 12"" screen or climate control. They are neat, but wholly unnecessary, as phones can take care of everything I need and then some.  But to each there own. This truck does have, park sense, rear camera, puddle lights, skid plates, On/Off tires/ Bilstein Shocks, Hill Descent control, Factory break controller, 220amp alternator, 6 aux switches, clearance lamps, and overhead night light (weirdly my favorite feature in my last truck too. It's the simple things) It's a well refined  beast. There are a few things I don't care for: The ugly SXM antenna (I didn't get SXM nor do I want it), No flares on this year Off Road (it's an upgrade that usually results in rust anyway). Floor storage is only available on the Big Horn.  If you can get over your stigma of owning a gas powered HD, this truck is a game changer. I know Ford and GM are coming to market with their answer, but I don't see that this race will ever stop, so pick a spot in the line and cut in.

ram,2500,2019,Dave C- Maryland, 10/27/2019,Best truck on the market,4,"I searched 2500’s for 4 months. I went to the dealerships of Ford, Chevy, GMC, Toyota, and Ram. The F250 are light weight & seem powerful, BUT THATS BECAUSE THEYRE ALUMINUM. Price is outrageous, and style is too boxy. Also, comfort in the Fords are “Thumbs down”. Next, Tundra’s are nothing more than Overpriced Tacoma’s w/terrible gas mileage and next to nothing towing. GMC have all the Bells and whistles of luxury, but WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. Plus, I want a truck that WORKS, not shines in a parking lot. Lastly, Chevy’s options for the money are crap. $65,000 for a 2500 w/no bed liner, no running boards, no tie downs or fifth wheel hook up in the bed, and that’s on 2019. Finally, I got exactly what I was looking for in option/value/towing in the 2500 Hemi long bed. Design is smooth, sturdy, & options were best in class. Bed liner, FULL LENGTH running boards, back up & bed cameras w/zoom, tie down/5th wheel hook ups already in bed and also electric hookup inside bed. Interior is roomy, Bluetooth everything, tons of USB/power outlets, tons of under seat storage, heated seats & steering wheel, cup holders galore(I have 5 kids) and the price was low 50’s.

Nav/computer is awful and not fully functional. Everything electronic is unreliable. Less than 3 years old and I’m sitting here waiting for a tow truck. 4wd doesn’t engage well. Often doesn’t start. Then there are the days it doesn’t want to turn off. Won’t always get out of park even when completely level. Cruise control only works about 30 percent of the time. Truck thinks the axle lock is always on. Several recalls which means several wasted days at the dealership waiting and weeks of truck not being safe to drive while waiting for recall parts to arrive.

ram,3500,2011,mscmdurham, 10/02/2012,Love it!,4,"We bought a 2011 used with about 40k miles on it already.
I use it to pull my horse trailer and you can hardly even tell it is back there.
I have loaded 2 full tons of haycubes in the bed and although it squated a little it handled it just fine.


The only issue we have had with it so far is one day the key fob would not unlock the door. I made the mistake of using the manual key and everything went haywire.
We had to disconnect the battery and let it reset.
Also a couple of times while using the hands free device for the phone, even after the call was ended and the keys were out of the truck, the display stayed on.
Again had to disconnect battery and reset.
That happened 2 times."

I have the Laramie package and it is pure luxury...truck or not. Uconnect works excellent, I have the 730n. High quality leather, great sound system, quite ride, more power than I will probably ever need...and I pull heavy equipment. Lumbar support is outstanding. M.P.G,s are not horrible for a 1 ton with this much power, I can get it down to about 14 if I drive hard, normal driving gets me about 18-19. Towing 14000# gets about 10. Call quality on Bluetooth is excellent. Took about 3 minutes to pair my iPhone and download the phone book. Absolutely no buyers remorse...love it. Would do it again!! "
ram,3500,2012,Ronald Coburn Jr., 08/04/2018,Amazing Performer!!,5,"Update: 6 February 2019
Still running strong!!  Had the dealer perform a detailed cleaning and waxing and the vehicle looked like new!!  Minor rock chips but to be expected with a nearly 7 year old truck.

Mechanical: even in -26 degree weather during the Polar Vortex, the truck started right up and the 4wd got me through some heavy snow!!  Bottomline, one emmision issue since my last posting.  The O2 wiring harness popped a code and was replaced, which is not cheap!!  Then the O2 Sensor popped a trouble code and was replaced, again, not cheap.  Funny part, Ram redesigned the wiring harness and location which makes me suspicious that this was a design issue.  For me, this solved the fault codes and I even saw an improvement in my gas mileage!!  Then came winter, winter fuel and the drop in mpg!!

Interior: holding up nicely.  The only drawback has been the information center screen.  Once you see the 2019/2020 center dash infotainment, control screen you have to be envious.  But let's face it, that is a minor cosmetic issue and my baby is paid for with zero issues!!  What more can you ask for!!  Runs great, starts every time, for its size great fuel economy,  interior isn't falling apart, no water leaks, brakes hold up better now compared to early models, hauls and pulls anything, and still looks great!!  Then you look at the resale value it has held onto and I can't complain!!

Looking forward to upgrading to the new 2020 Ram 3500 Longhorn Larime Megacab again, basically what I have but updated.  Just waiting to see some mpg data and a test drive before i pull the trigger!!  But again, paid for and runs/looks great,  it is going to have to blow my socks off in order for me to give up this truck!!

Prior assessment:
Well constructed, minimal repairs in 6 years, body and finish are rock solid, amazing engine, 4wd gets where you need to go, rides like a Cadillac for a truck, minimal road noise at highway speeds!  17.7 mpg highway, 17 city; great value for your money!!  This is my 5th Ram diesel since 1994 and they have only improved with each new revisions!

Really Bad gas mileage ( diesel fuel),, but,, I kinda knew that would be the result of a truck weighing 8000 lbs! Comfortable on long trips. I took it to Las Vegas pulling a 7000lb racecar trailer down Route 66 and it got around 9 to 10 Miles per Gallon... Diesel fuel is Cheaper than gasoling for the first time in 4 years,,, So,, I'm enjoying a little reprieve.. I change the oil and filter every 3000 miles with Mobil Delvac and Genuine Mopar filters... Hopefully it will last a while... Had trouble with my 2009 2500 Blowing black smoke around 80,000 miles,, So I traded it in for this 2012 Duallie."

Well things are so darn sweet and adorable when posted all over the media of the Fiat Chrystal buyback unless you actually own one of these gems and Actually wishes to excercise your rite for buyback as it's nothing Zero as court orders have detailed. I would feel a tiny confident at this point if someone actually wishes to help this grossly intentional  negligent method used . I spent many months calling everyone even Fiat /Chrysler themselves and even the very corrupt company continue the same all throughput to include: Ram dealers &everyone involved all say "" We are not familiar how this works . Well according to the big media sugar display "" simply bring into local dealer for current KKB retail plus 10% .  Ha ha first fraud ! The behind scene TRUTH is : bring into a dealer for a third party appraisal by ""  the very dealer that sells trucks and pays wholesale for purchase "". I am as driven to mountains and rolled off edge waiting for a single educational answer as to how much or when and how ( will ever ) be paid when they take my only vehicle which was intentional gross negligence that resulted in such rare circumstances and I am left no choice now but filing several charges to merely move on with life with a new truck !  My 8th Ram 2500/3500 always dedicated. Now I wish to drop Ram and begin With Chevrolet duramax as the cummins has totally let me and all others substantially down ( let alone I am certain criminal charges would follow pertaining to the manner used being 100% opposite from the recall settlement action suit.   Imagine the recall Fiat customer service lines actually answer phones to say they have no information as to how the recall works as it's in the courts hands.    Sorry so long of boring message.

ram,3500,2013,Jeff Smith, 11/20/2018,Tough tow truck with a limousine ride,5,"This is a hard-working diesel 4x4 tow truck with 50,000+ miles now. (Diesel was not a review menu choice.) Use it to move equipment, tractors, trailers, boats, etc on hitch (not a 5th wheel.) Replaced Ram '05 3500 5.9 diesel 4x4 with this 6.7. Had to evolve with DEF, particle filter regeneration and more restrictive fuel requirements, but was rewarded with much better performance AND fuel mileage! Expect more than 20 mpg at highway speeds after ~10K miles and closer to ~25-27 driving 50-60 mph country roads. Hyper-miling techniques help a lot with a 4-ton truck. Cabin creature comforts, fit & finish are a quantum leap. Also use it to commute for up to 700 miles in a day: great ride for a 1-ton truck with superior road presence. Ram boxes are very convenient lockable storage; there's plenty of cabin storage, too. Always serviced at dealership, so recalls were transparent to me. Have had repeat bothersome issue with ""water in fuel filter"" warning, but no other problems. Had the vibration/ shake at highway speed issue one day after a long period of not driving it - loaded 1,000#(+) equipment that afternoon and vibration disappeared. She apparently likes to work! At the price of new vehicles nowadays, I hope to get many more years of service out of this truck. So far, I feel confident that I can expect that.

ram,3500,2014,T.A.W., 12/23/2017,"Please, don't buy a RAM Truck",1,"I hope this review saves someone else from wasting a lot of money and time on a RAM truck.
A little history of my ownership experience:
My use of a truck is not just driving on pavement. I spend a great deal of time on forest roads, this is not hardcore off road terrain. Bumpy, Muddy, and a bit of fun yes, but not “Off road” really. I pull trailers, the heaviest around 13,000 Lbs and lots of freeway driving.

I have always owned trucks, my first vehicle was a mid-80’s Toyota pick-up, then a mid-90’s Toyota Tacoma, then a 2004 Toyota Tundra. In early 2013 I wanted a bigger truck and I also missed driving a manual transmission truck. The only automatic vehicle I have ever owned was the 2004 Tundra.  I went all out and purchased a new 2012 RAM 2500 diesel Crew Cab. The 2012 was in the shop every month like clockwork. You could not drive this truck for more than half a day off pavement without the check engine light coming on, which was ironic since the mode of the truck was an “Outdoorsman”.  After two years I had had enough and worked it out with the dealership to trade the truck in on a 2014 RAM 3500 diesel with a manual transmission. I was thinking that all RAMs could not be this bad or the company would be out of business. Well I was wrong.
2014 RAM 3500 Big Horn 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel Crew Cap with a manual Transmission Review:
The truck has power I’ll give it that, but only when it is not in the shop for something. The main issue was the exhaust system. In my option it is a very poor design that has various bandaid fixes, but should be redesigned and made functional. In the two years I owned this truck every part of the exhaust system was replaced at least once and many were replaced multiple times. One comment I get all the time was why not just install a “delete kit” and solve the problem. I’m sure this would have made the truck usable and improved the overall performance, but I feel you should not have to break Federal Law for a functional truck. The truck put me in limp home mode 2 times while more than 100 miles from home. If you are not familiar with this mode, the truck computer will give you a warning that in 150 miles your top speed will be 5mph. This is one of the most frustrating things, since it is not a failure of a key system that allows the engine to function, but rather an exhaust system failure 
Aside from the exhaust issues, there was a host of other issues:
1. The 3rd taillight leaked water in the cab twice. I finally gave-up on the dealer fixing this and fixed it myself with a little bit of caulking. It should be noted that this also occurred on my 2012 RAM. It is a very common problem with RAMs. Easy fix with caulking, but for the price you pay for this truck the cab should not leak.
2. The windshield wiper motor failed, casing the windshield wipers to no longer work.
3. The emergency brake light would not go out in cold weather, luckily the emergency brake would disengage. 
4. Transmission started leaking a little around 30,000 miles
5. The cruise-control button started not working intermittently around 50,000 miles
6. The latch on the middle console stopped working and was locked in the closed position
7. Around 58,000 miles a bushing in the front end started to fail and would make a clunking sound every time you turned the wheel while driving or not.
8. The exterior body detail between the front and rear doors started to crack and peel.
While the 2014 RAM was in the shop a little less than the 2012 RAM, both trucks were complete failures. If you are looking at purchasing a new truck please, don’t buy a RAM. Hopefully you will never know firsthand the pains and financial loss of owning one.

Will go into limp mode if low on Def but never have. Exhaust will have problems if you do not go 25 miles when regenerating. Shutting off when in regenerating will mean exhaust will carbon up and might not go back into regeneration again for quite a while. Taillight leaking in cab? Must be front but never have and fail to see how anyway. Would I buy again? No for the following reasons regarding saftety. I do not have HID headlights. Mine does not light up sharp corners. I have some sharp corners with trees. I have to stop and inch around. Completely blind in pitch dark. Easy head on. Lights do not adjust right or left. Truck like this should be electrical adjust for up and down with the loads this carries.Had to put on another set of driving lights pointing sideways. I get blinked. Signal in mirrors are worthless except from front. People in blind spot can not see them. Look at Ford for good ones and their lights. Pulling a 5th wheel is dangerous for all plus law suit. Should be in mirror like every body else (Ford). Headlights from Stone Age have been like this. Now brakes also from Stone Age. Go back to 1996 and read about lights and brakes. Still the same. If pulling a trailer with brakes granted you will not notice. They help stop the truck. Peddle goes 1/3 down and then you stand on it. Cured with $350 Hawk HD pads, wow! Bad low speed lag worse at 1,2,3 were you need it must with Aisn. Sucks! Gauges suitable for towing in 150 larime yuppy truck but not in 3500! What?

Only con is that with a sub under back seat takes away from lots of storage space.  For a crew cab lack of storage in cab is disappointing but worth working around.  Another negative and it can be real annoying, when pulling our 5th wheel from a stop and with aggressive throttle their is a loud reverberation through the driveline originating from what I have found out from others to be rear leaf spring issue.  By feathering the throttle on start with a load the noise is pretty much null, but it's still a nuisance to know that engineering should have eliminated this defect prior to production.

ram,3500,2019,Todd Heading, 05/19/2019,Lots of improvement as well as quality issues,3,"New 2019 Ram 3500 Laramie has a lot of improvements comparing to my 2017 Ram 3500 Laramie. However, it came with a lot of quality/technical issues. My truck has 700 (seven hundred) miles on odometer, out of first two weeks of ownership I was deriving vehicle one week, another week it's in service. *** Previously owned 2017 Ram 3500 Laramie 4x4 with Cummins Diesel, heavy-duty transmission and dual rear wheels, I've learned a few lessons and ordered this 2019 Ram 3500 Laramie in configuration, optimal for my task (10% recreational towing, 90% commute). By eliminating a few options that I almost never used previously, I have saved almost ~20k on purchase price. I decided to go with gasoline HEMI engine, no 4x4 and standard transmission with 2019 Ram 3500. *** The first catch was with specifications: Ram advertises ~150–200 lbs more in both payload and towing capacity in their marketing materials that actual vehicle was built and delivered (they explained it as those measurements were done for Tradesman trim and not applicable to higher trims like my Laramie). *** After delivery immediately second issue was realized – I was reinstalling fifth-wheel PullRite sliding hitch from my 2017 Ram 3500 and have found that my brand new 2019 Ram 3500 has distance between fifth-wheel prep sockets 3 mm longer on passenger side than on driver side. Fortunately, ISR frame by PullRite could accommodate this but on the length limit. *** Another surprise I have got after a few hundred miles – fueling truck was taking almost 40 minutes as nozzle was clicking back every quarter gallon. Dealership, after inspection, stated that ""fuel line was crossed during manufacturing process"" and still waiting for required parts for warranty replacement. *** Interior is definitely updated and feels much more luxury. I don't recommend going with their 12"" screen as it's still driven by relatively old software, slow and buggy. Another catch – if you order Group 2 option you will have wireless charging for your smartphone, but will still need to connect device with original cable to use Apple Car Play (i.e. Google Maps). *** Comparing 2017 and 2019, I don't see too many visible exterior improvements (i.e. panoramic sunroof is available only on 2019 Ram 1500), the best difference for me so far – front LED lights, makes a huge difference driving at night. *** HEMI pulls my 16.5k lbs trailer very nice, I can't tell the difference in towing between my 2017 Ram with Diesel / AISIN and 2019 Ram HEMI. I didn't drive in mountains yet, but don't think gasoline engine doesn't have exhaust brake, it actually doesn't need it. For engine braking purposes you downshift from steering wheel with 2019 Ram 3500 HEMI. *** Overall, great improvements, but looks like Quality Control needs to be greatly improved at Ram factory.

ram,3500,2019,JT, 08/02/2019,2019 RAM 3500 with 6.4L Gas is perfect,5,"After much researching and internet surfing plus test driving over 20 truck types and models, we ended up with a new 2019 RAM 3500 Crew Cab tradesman 4x4 Dually.  We needed a truck that was an easy daily plus could pull our 12,000 LB fifth wheel, but also did not cost me over $48k and this fit the bill perfectly.  
I only purchased a few optional packages on the Tradesman Crew Cab 4x4 Dually, which included the Tradesman Level 2 Equipment Group, Chrome Appearance Group, LED Bed Lighting, Parksense Rear Park Assistance and of course Trailer Brake Control and a few other minor things but cant remember what they were.  TIP: I had the Dealership install the aftermarket B&W gooseneck/fifth wheel stuff, which honestly is better then stock prep. 
 
So far the truck comes with lots of standard features what usually you would have to pay extra for, and here are some of the options I can recall that are included : 
Cruise Control, Tire Pressure Information on all 6 tires (Dually), UConnect, adjustable dash viewing options, configurable truck option in settings, Integrated Voice Control, Bluetooth Phone connectivity, Multiple USB connections, Rear storage under rear seats that fold up and out of the way, Power windows with one-touch down AND up too, power locks, power mirrors with blind spot mirrors plus flip out for towing, 32 Gallon tank (wow), Comes with both 4-pin and 7-pin connections for trailers, power rear sliding window, Rear window defroster, of course A/C and heater is in it (remember when A/C was optional, ha ha), Remote keyless entry, push button start (no key needed, just the FOB in pocket) and SiriusXM 1-year included plus several other things I forget. I did just get it last night, so I am still learning all of the features.  
BTW, I was able to get this for only $39k with extended warranty, after dealing with Dealer a lot, lol.  
This comes standard with a 3yr/36,000 bumper to bumper warranty (I increased warranty to 75k miles), plus a 5yr/60,000 mile Powertrain warranty on Gas engine (100k miles on diesel).

ram,3500,2019,Craig Newman, 03/22/2020,Ram Trucks are Great,5,"The New High Output Engine is great lots of power.  Took a 1000+ mile trip towing a gooseneck trailer,  mileage towing at 60-65 MPH was 12.1 MPG.  Towing at 70-75 mileage dropped to 11.9 still not bad for a 3500 Ram Dually.  Dave Smith Motors made this all possible with the best deals lowest prices and haggle free buying.  One would be foolish to buy a Ram from anyone else.

Ram 3500 HO still going strong, it has the power and smoothness to carry horses cows and other loads that require a smooth and steady ride.  It handles the rough roads well with a load on.  A great truck for towing

The doorhandles we’re not working properly and could not open the sliding door. The front headlights are constantly burning out, the rear stop lights keep constantly burning out, the interior cargo lights keep burning out, rear defroster stoped working, the hinges on the doors are loose and will fall off, at 54,000 I had to replace the radiator fan ($998.00) now I am hearing a ticking noise in the engine which the dealer is telling me will need to open the engine to correct issue (at no charge).  I have replaced brakes and rotors twice since I own it at $1000. Per time.  Front stuts need changing (leaking oil).  Very disappointed.  Also the upkeep is VERY EXPENSIVE.  This van can carry a ton of cargo but falls apart easily.  I would not buy again.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2014,Cornel Plescan, 06/01/2016,2014 Ram Promaster 3500 - for expediting,3,"Many people leaves reviews and empty their frustration, but I want to share this:
I bought my 2014 Ram Promaster 3500 cargo van in March 2015, at 140 miles, today June 1st, 2016 have already 125 600 miles. ...I am spending most of my time on the road doing expediting. ..
I tried to make it as much as comfortable for me, which this van can offer you good option...
My dissapointments are:
1...not very good on fuel 
2...over 3,000 lbs doesn't perform well 
3...the A/C is not powerful enough if you are in heat zones 
4....at 125,000 the transmission broke down after I went to dealer and did the flush, just after two weeks, and of course is not in a warranty anymore 
5....not enough parts, hard to find parts and accessories, even the air filters expensive but hard to find even at the dealer 
6.....start leaking trough the roof when sits under the rain
7....many dealers are not equipped or authorized to work on these vans
8....the headlights low beam light bulbs every 4-5 weeks are burning 

9...around 275000 broke down lifters replaced, soon after alternator, battery, drive axle.

Any repairs are very expensive and poorly done no matter where it was done AZ, NM, MI, NY, IN, MO

My advice, do your homework before thinking of buying it, I don't recommend it

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2014,dlam1995, 05/01/2015,"Great Van, Just Hope it Doesn't Break",3,"Don't get me wrong, our Promaster has been easily one of our best preforming vans... When it doesn't need to be fixed. 

A few months back, we got it back from the local body shop after it had been t-boned in an accident. Recently, the front end on the same side it was hit on in the prior accident. Our mechanic found that the strut mount had failed, so he called to get the part. Our wait time? Two months (projected to be available on June 30th) just for that rubber block. Our work in the heating field means we need to be mobile, and we can't afford to loose that mobility. 

You'd figure that you would actually be able to get parts for a new vehicle. If you can't get parts, don't bother."
ram,promaster-cargo-van,2014,Mitch Romero, 02/03/2016,Don't buy a Ram Promaster,1,"Only a Promaster dealer can work on these vans and They are far and few. They don't tell you that when you buy them. Very few dodge dealers are authorized to work on these vans. They have to have bought into the Promaster franchise. Therefore service can be slow and awful because the dealer knows the next Promaster dealer can be hundreds of miles away. We purchased Three  2014 Promaster vans they have all been to the repair center several times more than our fleet of 2005 Chevy vans to date. Most of our cheverlots have never had breakdowns beside general maintaince. The back up camera on one Promaster has going out on one at 39,000 miles,  transmission out at 42K miles, rear tail lights  continue to burn. Every one of them leak water through the back doors when it rains. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE, WE HAVE ALSO HAD NUMEROUS RECALLS FROM DODGE.  They never keep the truck for less than a week at time two to three weeks in most cases. We are a service Company and are going to get rid of all of them, which we will take a big lose because we have our Vans wrapped and shelving unit install inside them. We as a Company are Finish with Dodge!!!!!!

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2014,Jordan B., 01/30/2018,What a nightmare,1,"Bought this new, didn't drive it very much initially, which we greatly regret, as we could have used our state lemon law. The rear door latch was broken when we bought the van. It was repaired five times by the dealer. We started driving the van more in 2017 and hit some major problems: van started going into limp mode at around 15k miles. The check engine light went on, van wouldn't go over 40 mph, and engine would rev to 1500 RPMs. The dealer said they might have to charge us to diagnose problem. My husband did a quick internet search, saw this is a common problem with Promaster vans. Shut down car and restart once, this takes it out of limp mode. Restart it a second time and the check engine light went off. We hoped this was a one time thing, but it kept happening. The Service Department at the dealer is worthless. They pretend that we are the only Promaster owners having problems, treat us like we are unreasonable for being upset that our van is so unreliable. For each repair they keep the van for a minimum of 2-3 weeks. We have to call frequently to get status updates. For limp mode, the dealer replaced the throttle position sensor, but this did not work. When we took it back a second time, they replaced the main computer/PCM. When we picked up the van after this repair, some of the lights (seat belt, battery) stayed on on the dashboard. The dealer thinks this is the instrument cluster. They want to charge us for this. At around 16k miles we heard a loud sound in the engine. The dealer said they might have to charge us to diagnose and repair this, but it was a broken fly wheel, covered under the 5 year powertrain warranty. The service advisor told us not to take this on long trips, but to ""stay local"". So we have a $30k van with 16k miles on it that we can't use. When we picked it up after the fly wheel repair, it started making a different engine noise. We dropped the van off again at the dealer to replace the instrument cluster and diagnose this new noise. After 2 weeks they hadn't even attempted to diagnose the noise, just called us and told us the van was ready to pick up. We refused to take possession of it until they determined what the noise was. The service advisor yelled at us, said, ""You'll never be happy"", and ""What am I supposed to do, it's not pulling any codes"". We finally got the service manager to agree to diagnose the new noise - it is a broken idler pulley (which they'll charge us for). Or is it? The dealer really doesn't seem to know what to do with these vans, just keeps replacing parts hoping that something will work. So now we are out of our 3 year warranty, and we're too late for our state lemon law. I have contacted a lemon law firm that thinks we may have a case. There is the federal lemon law, breach of warranty, and basic consumer safety laws that may cover us. If we had just driven the van more when we first got it, we would have had a very clean cut case with the lemon law and not had to go through an attorney. We have also called Fiat Chrysler, but all they do is recommend arbitration. It's non-binding to the consumer, but if you agree to terms from arbitration, you have to sign away your right to a future class action suit against FCA, and no way would I do that. These Promasters are a nightmare and there may very well be some sort of class action litigation in the future.

Less than 20,000 miles and needs all new brakes and rotors. When I drive it, the wheels are hot to touch and sometimes smoking. Headlight bulb replacement 3 to 4 times a year, and not an easy change. leaks everywhere. Bad wiring everywhere. Very few dealerships can work on them, and in my case, they are pretty incompetent. Ram doesn't seem to care about this. Servicing the engine is horrible. location of the fluid fills are horrible. Same for oil filter location. The trans leaks, but there is no dip stick to check level! Front clanking bump sounds developed after about 10k miles. Trans periodically slips and changes gears for no reason. As someone who uses this van to earn their living, not only it has cost me lots of money to maintain, I have probably lost triple that in lost work because it was in the shop. If the engine or trans goes, it will put me out of business.

Was told the pump was bad and they had to order over and over again because if the pump came to the dealership as a 2014 they would trash and reorder until they received a 2015 pump.  Thought that was strange but I took it as the 2015 part was improved.   I find myself having to replace the headlight bulbs every 5 to 6 months for some reason.  Had a tick in the motor after 3 years. Ram did cover the labor but the expence of the cam shaft was on me.  Currently I am replacing the ball joint on the right side twice in the last 6 months which when the ball joint goes it rips the 450.00 CV axel in half.  So after labor that's 1200 repair back to back not to mention had it come apart on the highway the vehicle could have flipped.  I'm lucky to be alive.  I called commercial Dept for Ram and no help.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2014,Gary Reysa, 09/19/2016,2014 ProMaster Converted to RV,4,"Mine is a 2014 ProMaster high roof 136 inch WB that was purchased new in 2014.  We have converted it to an RV and put 22,000 miles on it.  It has been a good vehicle so far and does the compact and efficient RV role very well.  It gets 19 to 20 mpg on trips, which is exceptional for an RV - twice what our last small class B RV got.  It is comfortable to ride in and provides great views out the large windshield.  It is highly maneuverable (drives like a car) and parks in normal car spaces.  It does well in the snow (we are in MT, so lots of snow) and it does back roads well.  The only significant mechanical problem has been squeaky brakes, which the dealer finally fixed at no cost.  There have been some minor recalls that the dealer took care of with no problems.  I have yet to spend a single dollar on it for repairs other than oil changes.  The dealer support has be very good, but I would rate the support from FCA at something like a C minus.

Dealership did cover it though, I got lucky. Brakes and struts bad at 30,000. Trans-axle bad at 31,000 miles. When it rains it pours with this mistake of a Van. It probably was a decent van until Chrysler got a hold of it.

Update:
After all the work has been done on the van the breaks still aren't right. It's running good though and people say it's a great looking van. It's comfortable, good acceleration for a v6 and hope it last me a while. If I had it to do over again I probably would have gone with the Ford, possibly the Nissan.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2014,Joseph DeLacruz, 07/08/2016,So far so good.,4,"I've had this van since December of 2013 and have only racked up 34K miles on it.  I don't use it commercially, it was just a better replacement for my full size pickup. It's basically used as a REAL sport utility vehicle for my dirt bikes, kayak, snowboarding, camping and hauling things once in a while. I'm 5'8"" and find the seating position very comfy, longest drive I've done in one day was 550 miles. I love the cavernous interior, it was the widest and tallest of all the low roof contemporary euro style vans, with the lowest step up height.  It's performed well in snow due to the front wheel drive (which was a selling point for me, I only wish there was a 4WD version).  So far the only problem  I had was front parking lights contacts corroding, but it was fixed during a recall, it had a bunch of other various recalls that were fixed at the same time (so I hope). The other HUGE gripe I have was when filling up with gas I have to hold the trigger the whole time because the gas trigger lock unlocks probably due to the gas filler hose angle (?), but it only happens in California with the vapor recovery boot.  Ive averged 20mpg, which was alot better than my pickup.  Time will tell if I get any of the problems mentioned in the other review, but my experience have been positive so far.  I do all of my maintenance on all of my vehicles because I'm a mechanic by trade  and don't trust dealerships. I think if you read into specific vehicle forums, you'll get a better perspective of how owners think of their vehicles, because many people that give reviews on automotive sites are just the mad ones with that have had problems.

It's been a great company asset to me. I kitted it out for one person to sleep in and the rest of the space is cargo. I drive pretty miserly and get average 19mpg. If you are in a hurry it will use much more gas- that's your choice. So far there have been no mishaps or breakdowns of any kind. It's fast! Almost 300Hp moves this van more than sufficiently - I've humbled a few teens in mom's car at stoplights. Pulls a trailer very well, and back-up cam is super nice. I've done oil changes myself - pretty simple. No complaints from me thus far. Looking forward to many more years with this rig and recommend it over the competition for cavernous cargo space/low step-up thanks to the front-wheel drive system. The stock tires may be great for city streets but are pretty bad in snow and Offroad. I recently replaced them with Grabber AT-X tires and it’s far more capable in both snow and Offroad. I’ll never put stock tires back on.

If you are looking to purchase one of these vehicles I highly suggest, from experience, not to purchase the Ram Promaster 2500.
Why not? Because you want a vehicle that doesn't need to have its transmission replaced every hundred-thousand miles.
What? Yes. It has a mini-van trani in it and they are only rated for 100,000, that's it
I had mine done at 98,000
But that's not all. There are plenty of other issues, nearly to numerable to list.
Electronics shorts require it to be jump started frequently. The mechanics are unable to find these and down time has been costly.
The radio and rear cameras stopped working and were disconnected.
The transmission mounts went and now the van can make sharp right hand turns without you even turning the wheel!
It will drive you right off the road in moments should you blink too long.
It's rated at 20mpg but that's a lie. You are fortunate to get 15.
Continual problem with the rear door locking
Sounds like a freight train going down the road.
You cannot get parts for it!!!
I have been on a waiting list, and I am number 365 on the list, just for a transmission mount.
Brake caliper blew up. They are not sold at the local auto parts store, nor are they sold at Napa nor are they sold at Autozone, nor are they sold at Advanced Autoparts. You have to go online and search for them. Or, you could ask your dealer. I think that's what Ram wants, use their overpriced dealer garages to siphon even more money out of your wallet.
Let's review shall we:
Faulty breaks
Faulty electrical system
Full dashboard failures
Mini-van transmission that you are guaranteed to have to replace
Engine mounts that will need to be replaced
Hard to find, no, nearly impossible to find parts
Locking issues
Water comes in through the top of the windshield
I mean, these are not little issues. These are time intensive, costly issues.
Please, do not purchase this van. You will certainly regret it.
I was insulted one day when a fellow contractor said I had purchased one and he said that he had one at one time and that it was the biggest hunk of junk he had ever purchased. Now that I think about it he was most certainly %100 correct. I could have done better in a junk yard and saved myself all of that money.
If I can even sell it I doubt I will even get back the money I put into the repairs!

Worse work vehicle I have owned.

Dodge needs to quickly discontinue this truck... great concept on the loading height and cargo space everything else is complete crap.... I'm immediately trading this in... might need a lemon law lawyer.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Eric, 11/11/2017,Complete Garbage,1,"Poorly designed period. Horrific, unreliable hunk of GARBAGE.  Purchased a little over a year ago and have had so many problems I feel like suing Ram. Its been back to the dealership at least a dozen times for in many cases the same repairs. To be completely honest I could sit here and write a book about how pathetic this vehicle is. I am left feeling completely ripped off. Stay away from Ram Period.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Tony, 03/14/2017,"New Promaster, Run away, just Run away.....",1,"Promaster concept is great!  I fell in love with it for what I do.  I own a fleet of expedite vehicles and they pile the miles on in a hurry. You can see that I scored it fairly high in most areas but had to give it a 1.  Mainly because it should score a -8 on value and maint. costs.  front brakes on a 2015 with 55k miles.  Dealer told me it is $1000.00 bucks for rotors, ""special order"" retainer clips and brake pads.  $1000 for front brake job?   I have a 2016 with 100k on it and 2015 with 55k.  The 2016 will need a complete top end rebuild, it is a gas engine and sounds like a diesel.  I use full synthetic every 7500 miles.  Headlight replacement very prematurely, several times.  Automatic engine brake engages automatically on very slight decline causing an already under reliable engine to rev up to the point of failure.  If you have a plumbing business or you are an electrician and need a van for 15k miles a year, and have a back up vehicle for shop times, this would be a great van.  If you truly need a commercial grade vehicle and depend on it for your livelihood, this is definitely not it.  Body parts are nearly impossible to find as it is assembled in Turkey or somewhere over there.  Don't take my word for it, call a body shop and ask about repairing a Promaster van.  I also have 2 Chevy cutaway vans and they both have over 130k miles and run like a top!  (2) Ford Transit Vans.  They are not setting any records but still light years ahead of where the Promaster is.  Lastly, what does Ram do to help new customers with their quality problems you might ask?  They lower the warranty from 2015 100k miles powertrain warranty to 2016 60k miles powertrain warranty.  Oh, the Ram truck will still have the 100k powertrain, but not the $41,000 ""commercial"" van.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Dave Cangelosi, 09/16/2015,not a happy driver,1,"My pro-master does not even have 10,000 miles on it. It has multiple recalls, engine makes noise, the brakes make noise, and the reversing camera is bad. The main issue is that the dealers do not put any energy to fix it, It has been into several different dealers and they just let it sit there (we will get to it when we can,, we are busy) Well I have work to do also.  If you need your truck on the road, don't get the pro-master.  We have four of them, and switched back to Chevy.
    Many months latter, still the worst vehicle I ever drove.
3/2017 a definite do not buy.  Still no Promaster mechanic has been able to fix the recalls on the back doors. (not sure why) It only gets about 12.4 miles to the gallon once it is loaded up with inventory.  The truck seems to burn out lights about every 2000 miles. I am constantly replacing some sort of an exterior light.  These are common issues on all four of our vans of the Promaster line.  Oh yea,, my reversing camera is still broke.  They can not figure it out.  Once it is filled with inventory, this truck will get stuck in an eighth inch of snow.  No one stands behind this product and its a poorly constructed bucket of junk.
   9/2017 I noticed another review saying that they got good gas mileage. The only way that the four we have would get o.k. mileage is if they are empty, Why would you need a van if you were going to drive it empty?  Still not happy, still a lot of issues that did not get fixed.
  9/19. Still driving it, and it has an endless list of repairs that have beed done and still need to be done: - radiator leaks, power stering fluid leak, engine oil leak, and did i mention the head lights burn out every 2000 miles like clock work. Only 56,000 miles on this bucket of junk and it has more repairs on it than my chevy trail blazer with 138,000. This was and is a terrible truck

At 52,000 miles my engine my blow.. It was in the shop 20 times!! Lost money couldn't work for weeks because the Dodge dealer took forever trying to fix it..

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Richard Marsh, 10/24/2017,ProMaster Ram 1500 with Sherrod conversion JUNK!!,1,"WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!! Within the first couple of days  the passenger door mirror fell off, rear tag light didn't work. The conversion company put different tires on and the tire pressure light stayed on because failed to adjust computer. The back seat bed would not got down.  Dealer got new motor from Sherrod. Dealer put it wrong so bed went up sideways. We had an antifreeze leak.  dealer said it was a Sherrod pump. Hard to get pump since they changed models. FINALLY got the correct pump installed by dealer. More on that later.  Now the brakes started to squeal. Dealer said ""most do that"" Not a good answer. SO I took the brakes apart my self. There is NO anti squeak lube between the brake pads and the caliper. Fixed that myself front only. NO squeal. NOW the latest, the car will not start sometimes. The key goes into start position but the starter motor will not engage, at times the key cannot be removed. Dealer said they have to order a new key assembly . The old one is about to fall out.  Now back to antifreeze pump, started to smell antifreeze again. When pump was changed hoses were crimped and hose clamps were loose on pump and leaked. I fixed that put in a new hose with insulation.  Still have trouble starting  the car....... DON'T BUY  DON'T BUY... I'm putting  L-E-M-O-N on the windows with the dealerships name . Ps dealer is in Canton Ga. I've only had the car 8 months.
UPDATE:  4/26/18  We no longer have the van it stranded us 4 times I originally said it was JUNK.... My update now is  SUPER SUPER JUNK....I can't emphasize this enough DON'T BUY a Sherrod Ram 1500 PROMASTER Period don't even look at one ....I now have a Ford Transit converted by Explorer MUCH MUCH better, but don't get the tire and wheel upgrade for $1800. That is a rip off. They originally put on junk tires instead of what we ordered , we made them change them to what we ordered.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Jeremy Main, 04/09/2017,Lemon,1,"Worst vehicle my company has ever purchased. In the shop more than its on the road. Dodge customer support is terrible at best.  Problems included brakes locking up when below 32 degrees outside, side door broke and wouldn't close, headlight housing full of water when raining, engine light on a total of 20 different times each time going into limp mode and needingredients 1,000.00 and up repairs.   Ended up having to write out a check for 6,000.00 just to trade it in on a different vehicle as the resale value is the worst I've ever seen.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Mike, 09/27/2016,Just Bought Our Third,4,"I am surprised by some of the negative reviews here. I purchased a 2014 ProMaster, and added another last year. Just purchased our third one, a 2017. Very happy so far. Yes the driving position is unusual compared to  a car, but having grown up on VW Buses, I like it. The power door locks are a bit goofy, but otherwise the van is sensible and well thought out. Compared to the Sprinter that we also own, this van feels light, but more responsive. It makes our Ford E series feel like the dinosaur it is. I like the low load floor the FWD offers , and it has been OK in the snow-no better or worse than our front engine/rear drive vans. The dealer has been great to us for both sales and service, although I do drive about 15 miles for it. Our much closer local dealer was very rude both when I went to look at the ProMaster for purchase and when we brought the Sprinter in for service (they were a Sprinter dealer at one time). It is not a Mercedes S class in terms of refinement, but it is a work van and as a work van this has proven to be a functional, reliable tool. I own a plumbing service business in Chicago, so we deal with very harsh weather changes, brutal potholes, tons of traffic, and many stops.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Alpha Tech, 08/31/2017,2500 diesel run away from it.,1,"Our company put about 2 to 3000 miles every two weeks on the vehicle. Vehicle is in the shop every two weeks diesel exhaust problems. Vehicle will slowdown in the left lane to 5 miles an hour sometime right after service due to diesel exhaust system.  Headlight will go every few months( very hard to change without going to dealer). Our probables began at 6 to 8000 miles and escalated by 21,000 miles.  Parts very slow to get to dealer many dealers do not know how to work on the vehicle.  Radio antenna will blow off.  At a little over 100,000 miles we sold the vehicle off to auction.

I will don't buy one more car from Dodge ever.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Tom, 03/03/2016,"Terrible, run fast!",1,"This is total junk! Aside from rust everywhere, everything is inconvenient and must be designed as poorly as possible. I hate driving this van and would rather drive anything from the 80's! Aside from ridiculous understeer, the tires wear out every 12k due to poor design.  I don't think they could have designed this whole thing worse if they tried. Why is the oil filter in the most inaccessible place possible? Can't remove the keys if the battery dies? Radiator leak at 40k miles? Totally not designed for anyone higher than 5' tall.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Jeff, 03/30/2016,Can hear me coming a mile away,3,"We purchased the promaster for route work , usually making 10 or so stops a day.  After about 1000 miles we started getting the front brakes squealing like a pig and a grinding noise while almost coming to a stop. We thought it would stop eventually but at 4000 miles i couldn't stand it anymore and brought it back to the dealer.  I told them about the issue and they said they would check it out.  When i went back they said the brakes were working as designed and there was nothing else they could do.  Piss poor excuse in my book dodge... Wont buy another one..

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,LT, 08/25/2016,Sucks Fuel Like Nobody's Business,3,"I purchased the low roof short wheelbase version to haul motorcycles. Around town I get 16 at best (17 indicated on computer is optimistic). Highway the best I get is 15. I have the Pentastar 6-banger in my Pro-master. Other than the poor fuel economy my only other complaint is the suspension. Simply put it can't handle any bumps. On a rough road you'll want to pull over and check your fillings. When fully loaded it is a little better. Combine the suspension with a windy day and you'll want to stay off the interstate unless you want to be driving a box-kite down the road. The brakes work very well but there is so much front end dive due to suspension that you need to be careful. The front brakes also squeal like hell due to brake pad dust getting on the rotors. Other owners complain as well. All else is good. Excellent technology package, tall seat, spacious windshield. nice backup camera and the cargo area is huge. I sprayed in rhinoliner and insulated the walls/roof. A bulkhead is also a good idea. I'll likely keep the van even with the fuel economy and handling. It's an excellent delivery vehicle, but as an interstate vehicle you won't end up passing many gas stations. Summary Plusses - View of the road and high seating position, low deck height means easy to load things. Side door is awesome. Back doors swing open and completely out of the way. I mounted roof racks as well for ladders, etc. The truck is set up for racks that mount to tabs meaning no need to drill into roof.  Minuses - Fuel Economy/range, suspension, brake squeal, and it's the ugliest vehicle from the rear.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,BW Cupp, 08/21/2016,"Promaster, long wheelbase EXT.",4,"I have several Promasters and with the exception of the early 2014's, which had a few recalls, my experience has been good. Is the driving position a little strange, yes, could the dealer support be better, of course. But, after having several Sprinters, and having to pay big money to repair and maintain them, the Promaster is my new favorite. Great fuel mileage, turning radius, light feeling and easy to drive. The low floor height is helpful loading my dirt bike, or anything else. For the extra $10-15 grand for a Sprinter, it just doesn't make sense to me. Mine averages 18 mpg, which is what my Sprinters got on a good day. No more $150.00 oil changes. No more dealing with Mercedes dealers that don't really want to deal with you. No more messy diesel truck stops and the overpriced fuel. Now, if Toyota would just bring a van to compete with the Promaster and Sprinters my life would be much simpler.....2/22/17 Almost 3 years later, still enjoying the Promaster. Just went to Texas, and back, still averaging 18 mpg on gas, and no one problem. Works great for loading my dirt bike and going riding. Still have room for a couch that makes into a bed, sink, refrigerator, TV and surround sound. I am very comfortable camping! 2/22/19 Recently I bought a Transit 350, long, tall with the EcoBoost motor. Wow, what a fun motor to drive. I am not a speeder, my car is a Prius, but this is a good one. Is it better than a Promaster for camping? Not for me, but, I will say its nice to go up a hill and not be shifting back and forth like a Promaster. I get the same fuel mileage(18 mpg) on both. The width is a problem as it doesn't give you the options on floor plans that you have with a wider Promaster.  Promaster's have really increased in price over the years and I don't think there the bargain they once were, catching up with the Trainsit for sure. When camping, there's no substitute for room, so the Promaster wins against the Transit in my view. I would never again own a Sprinter.

Dealer would not cover the headlights under Warranty.  Dealer Charged $85 for the installed Replacement Bulb.  Actually a 15 minute job & $7.50 Bulb.  2 of 4 radios stopped working.  Had 2 Blower Control Modules Go.   Brake Pads were Originally $400 for PADs Only.. NO LABOR.  All of the Cargo Access Doors have issues, they will either not open, can't lock or won't latch shut.  There are a number of Torx Bolts holding the latches to back door hardware in place.  All side door ""Plastic Straps"" have broken so we need to rig ""Pull Strings"" to unlatch doors They Vibrate Loose & Fall out..  Back doors have swung open while on the interstate! Ram has created a monopoly by setting up only 2 Dealers in the Pittsburgh area so parts r often not available  & always VERY EXPENSIVE.  The Torx bolts were $9 Each & Were Out of Stock.  The good news is Front Wheel Drive Great In Snow, has more Cargo Space than the Ford Transit we have purchased to Replace Promasters.  Finally, WHY IS THERE NO CLASS ACTION SUIT FOR THE LOWBEAM HEADLIGHTS.  Every other Promaster u see on Road will have Burnt Out Headlight.

Because anyone that has a Ram ProMaster knows it is a total piece of junk with so many problems you can't even list them all. My transmission went out at 1700 miles.!! Thats SEVENTEEN hundred miles. Bolts were falling out of the car, water came in through the doors, the electrical system, and the guys at the ram service centers all take a deep breath every time another ProMaster pulls on to the lot for repairs. There has never been a vehicle that has been put together and designed so poorly with absolutely no consideration to the American consumers or people that might have been faithful and loyal to the Ram brand.

IT STILL SUCKS!!!,1,"I can't stand this van, for 10 hours a day it is my office and it has made me miserable since my boss foolishly bought it. he did not test drive and I am paying for it. The dealer sold us a van that is not at all practical for what we do. Its too short for what we need to haul. The window doesn't go all the way down so your resting your arm on a thin piece of glass, the steering wheel doesn't tilt so your stuck in an agonizing and compromising position all day. The driver seat offers no lumbar support. when reversing to a loading dock with the rear doors open it does this constant obnoxious beep so you cant hear if your going to run someone over. (my van was not equipped with a rear cab window) front wheel drive means no winter hills for me with a load. unless you really slam the rear doors and sliders it beeps saying they're open. the list goes on. just really do your homework before a purchase.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Brandon B, 12/15/2018,You will loose your a$$,1,"I have owned many work vans this is the worst ever. First, the headlights bulbs will fail constantly. My head (as in the top end of the motor...) had to be rebuilt at 96k. The touchscreen that controls many crucial features blacks out randomly. The transmission needed a full rebuild at 110k. The doors have all failed in one way or another and are cheaply made. I wash and wax it religiously and still small amounts of rust appear on the exterior door hinges. The sheet metal is so thin you can dent it with your knuckle. I would venture to say this is the worst van, maybe vehicle in history. Do not!!! Do not!!! Buy one. Its making its final voyage to a dealership today where I will loose my final massive amount of money. I am a professional contractor of 22 years. Commonwealth dodge of Louisville was great dealing with the head rebuilding but I’ll never buy Mopar again. This Is the result of something that has been over or under engineered, produced within fear materials and likely nonunionized labor in Mexico. They probably make two dollars an hour so I can’t blame them for not really caring too much. The Postal Service uses these vans so I can only imagine how many millions that’ll cost us.

The Brakes did squeal some at first but when I hit 8000+ miles it stopped the annoying squeal .and I might mention sometimes when going up a steep hills it's a little gutless but I did not buy this to be a sports car? However I am carrying a Heavy cold plate freezer about which weighs about 800 #lbs plus a lot of ice cream to haul around so considering that I am carrying that kind of weight it has performed just fine! I have now only 22000 miles on it; and drive out to the Beach sometimes where it has done just fine? the Diesel mileage is usually between 22-25 miles per gallon but I've seen it hover just under 30 mpg so you see I've really had no major complaints to speak of? I love my van.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Canine wrangler, 09/22/2018,Guess I got the good one!,4,"2500 Hightop diesel. 21,000 miles. Converted to camper. Unlike other reviewers, I have not replaced a single light. The transmission has s built in clutch which takes a bit of practice to master. I always use the manual shift option while in the city. Twice I almost got into an accident when the engine and transmission stumbled when in drive mode. Once, when crawling through an intersection then punching the accelerator to avoid an accident..the van stalled. Second time I slammed on my brakes when someone almost hit me in an intersection. The transmission got confused and stalled. Recall on ignition switch and trailer hitch wiring. Silver van, extremely poor paint job. Repainted entire passenger side under warranty. Dealership took off moldings and put them back on using same two face tape. Moldings were flapping in the wind by the time I got home. Went back and they did it right. Brakes squeal. Took it to dealership and they told me you have to ride them hard a few times to get the dust off them. Total idiots!  Aside from the noise , they work great. I don’t care for the plastic nose and grill. Already it’s fading after 3 years. Ram should have painted them instead of trying to pocket  a few bucks.Positive qualities.. I like the way the van handles. Seats are comfortable and the dash layout is simple and effective. Bluetooth is great.. Synchs up with my phone and streams music with no fuss. Diesel is torquey and flies up hills. Averaging 26 mpg. No loose bolts, doors don’t sag, antifreeze doesn’t leak. No rust.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Andy, 10/13/2018,Best option out there,4,"Most of the complaints people have about this vehicle (low beams, doors, etc) are so darn easy to fix permenantly that they should not discourage anyone considering a cargo van.  I replaced the low beams with LED bulbs for <$50 off Amazon and have been using them for 2 years now without a single issue.  The door side door latch is a bit more complicated to fix but still like a 20 min job, once.  Why would you ever write off 1 of 3 real options for simple fixes that take less than an hour ONCE to fix.  Otherwise, the vehicle isn't perfect (much like every other car on the road) but does everything it needs to do when you need it to do it.  The pros most certainly outweigh the cons here, leaving you with the superior cargo van.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Guy, 08/27/2017,2 years of personal ownership,4,"Using the vehicle for small business. Driving conditions very moderate and conservative. Climate area of extreme heat and mild winters. Vehicle functions well so far. Doing an average mileage of 8000 per year. So far no major issues. Drove the vehicle cross country from east coast to west coast with fully loaded cargo. Cargo is mostly light weight but once in a while vehicle load with full capacity 2 pallets weighing 2800 pounds and the vehicle pulls it like a champion. RPM ranging from 2.5 and up to 3.8 on higher angle slopes. Overall trip read a surprisingly 18.8 MPG with an average speed of 66 MPH. It feels heavy and stable on the road like a mini truck. Overall pretty satisfied with the handling and cargo area.

Cons: steering wheel has a slight uncomfortable angle and could have been made with more adjustable options and better hand grip (personal preference). Some of the controls could have been closer to the driver. Interior and exterior plastic cover looks cheap and I am worried it would fall apart as soon as the warranty expires. The body of the vehicle also makes an impression of paper thin. Driving the vehicle on a manual mode do actually make a significant difference in RPM and has a potential to save money on gas. Manual drive shift is inaccurate - an attempt to pull low gear at an elevated slope and automatic shifting went into gear regardless of manual intervention. I have a history driving multiple Dodge vehicles and they all start to fail as soon as warranty expires or sooner like a ticking time bomb.

Pros: relatively quiet, pretty comfortable seating stable on the road, sharp turns are a plus, and storage space is maximized to the highest potential.

As for accessories I decided to purchase a motorcycle garage rubber mat and cut it to size for bedding. It works great, cheap, and protects the floor from scratches. Planning to cover the walls also at some point to avoid scratching the interior paint.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,BSCI, 12/12/2019,Replaced entire fleet,5,We were asked to demo a Promaster when they first came out.  We fell in love with it.  Going from rear wheel drive to front wheel drive is amazing in the winter.  We own 5 Promasters.  I think the only problem we've really had is replacing headlights.
ram,promaster-cargo-van,2015,Bryan, 12/21/2019,Garbage.,1,"I'm amazed at the 5 star reviews. Even without the constant problems, there are too many design flaws with this van. This one is set up for electrical work, and at 50k miles has had transmission problems, radiator replaced, headlight assembly replaced, the heater intermittently fails, constant coolant smell in the cab that no one can figure out, bad door latches, and gets horrible gas mileage. FWD is great in the snow and allows for a low load floor, but the downsides outweigh this.  When loaded down, this thing spins the tires no matter how gentle you are, partially due to the all or nothing transmission. Trying to accelerate smoothly only results in slamming downshifts and the engine screaming. It also hates to reverse uphill, somehow being both gutless and uncontrollably surging. 
Seating position and visibility are one of the few things I like about the van. Controls in general are not well designed, and the touch screen sucks. As some have pointed out, the windows don't roll all the way down. Why?
If I had purchased this, I'd sell it at a loss. Not worth it. As it is, my company runs its vehicles into the ground, so I'm stuck with it for awhile. Luckily, that probably won't be as long as most work vans, as I'm sure it won't make it to 100k without equaling its purchase price in repair costs.

This van has served me well as in my business as an ice cream van. most of my business is stop n go and this van has held up well, It has now after 4 years has just turned over 27000 miles?  I maintain normal maintenance and no problems? the only negative I can find is the radio which I never use keeps coming on by itself which is annoying?

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2016,PROMASTER OWNER, 08/12/2017,FROM A GUY THAT OWNS TWO 2016 RAM PROMASTERS 1500,1,"I own two pro masters of the same year and the same model, and I want to provide an honest review separated by sections so that you can make the best decision possible when purchasing this vehicle. 

DO I RECOMMEND THIS VEHICLE: No, I don't. I would suggest you purchase a more reliable van by Ford. The vehicles have been great regarding the space they provide, and I like the seating, but the reason I suggest you stay away from this vehicle is that there is just way too many issues with them. I read some reviews by some disgruntled people and I typically think they're just upset, but it doesn't happen to everyone. Well, I own two, and the problems between both of them have been tremendous, and all before the vehicle reached 30,000 miles. 

Van 1: Before 20,000 miles first the bolts in the door were loose and began falling out. PROBLEM #1: I noticed something with the door, and it was bent because of the bolts missing and securing the door. PROBLEM #2: While driving the vehicle just died. Towed it to the dealership and entire oil system needed to be replaced because it was malfunctioning. Warranty covered it. PROBLEM #3: The driver side window stopped working and had to get that fixed. PROBLEM #4: The sensor for low tire pressure is always on indicating low pressure when it's fine, had to get that replaced. PROBLEM #5: Back door wouldn't open, the cables had to be readjusted on the door. PROBLEM #6: The air conditioner now produces a low-level hum that is always present. I haven't had this fixed yet but will update when I have it addressed. PROBLEM #7: The headlight bulbs burn out fast. I've had to replace them about five times already; this isn't normal. CONCLUSION: All these issues had taken place before 30,000 and were all covered by warranty. I will say that calling Promaster has been great as they took care of all the issues for me and they do a great job at that. Even if you take it to the dealership, always notify Promaster so they can follow up with everything. 

VAN 2 PROBLEMS: I purchased this with 20,000 miles, and all of these issues happened before 40,000.  PROBLEM #1: Headlight keeps going on on the left, I replace it twice a month at this point. PROBLEM #2: When turning on the van the air conditioner doesn't work, and I have to restart the vehicle once or twice for it to reset and turn on. PROBLEM #3: The sliding door is stuck shut and won't open. I have to take it in because the handle won't work or anything else. PROBLEM #4: The vehicle is starting to loose power when driving and I'm taking it to warranty again next week for this issue. PROBLEM #5: The tire pressure sensor keeps tripping when the tires are filled just fine. 

No one should purchase a new vehicle or one with 20,000 miles and have this many issues; it's ridiculous.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2016,John, 12/27/2017,Beware,1,"I have 4 of these vans. Used for construction related biz. Also own Ford and GM vans. The Dodge Promaster is without a doubt the worst trucks we have ever owned. Mechanical and electrical failures. Cannot keep head lights in them. Also, these front wheel drive trucks do not go through snow or even wet roads. If you put any weight past the rear axle forget it. Front tires wear out fast. We have switched to Ford Transit vans. To early to tell how they will work out. If you buy a Dodge Promaster be sure do buy as much extended warranty as you can afford. You will need it.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2016,Ernest DeCarlo, 02/16/2016,Every contractor or delivery person should own it!,4,"While there are a few quirks about this vehicle, the good far outweighs them.
The front wheel drive is great. I have driven it twice in snow and wheels barely spin. The turning radius is great also and cargo is much better than my old GMC Savanna. The quirks are the left side arm rest is way too low for the seating position. And you sit at top of front window while putting the seat in lowest position. Like I said there is a lot to like about this vehicle for what I use it for. I'm in a service based business. I do not haul a lot of weight.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2016,David, 01/28/2016,Best vehicle I’ve ever owned!,5,"Updated review...completely satisfied with my huge bully of a cargo van! Well made.
REALLY well made. My favorite characteristic is the up front/forward seating position with its panoramic windshield. The front wheel drive is a blast and the engine torque is very powerful. Once you reach cruising speed, smooth, smooth sailing. FYI...I’m still amazed at the 
MPG this thing gets. I’m averaging approx 20. Go figure?! Anywho I love this thing.
Great interior, get the cargo box panel lining. Super sharp looking. VERY comfortable seats too. Be sure to get the armrest on both seats. Also be sure to get the power fold side mirrors. Opt for the aluminum wheels...wish they had some deep dish options to choose from. You can never look too cool even in a van. A few suggestion for FCA, more powerful A/C...pleeeease! A decent subwoofer under the seats would be a nice option too. An easy DIY, to quiet the cargo area, simply cram some sponge like insulation neatly between the roof and cross beams.
I know it sounds weird but it will make you feel like your in a high priced sedan. Costs maybe $7 at HomeDepot. I installed two bubble top ventilation fans in the cargo bay
that help take the load off the A/C. FCA, are you listening? One last thing. It’s a cargo van right? I can’t count how many times I’ve been approached about the van by contractors and just Dads. Let’s face it. This is America. We do stuff here. And nothing beats a big square cargo bay to make weekend projects fun. Expect relatives you didn’t know you had calling you to borrow it. Yeesh!

Manual said every 4000 miles but likely to go 40000 miles.  Gas mileage are 22 city 29highway and around 24 to 26 average.  So far not a single problems. Seats were feeling small just for one week than once used to it feels good. I am 5 11 190lb. Brake squels until new to 15000 miles but now it is gone. Move over from E150 this van is stronger in accelerating after first gear.  Do not need to down shift on hills and saving $200 per month in fuel.   I am driving about 3500 miles per month.  If this van hold up it will pay for it self.   $24000 in ten years

Update now 32000 miles second oil change and air filter.

Avg 26mpg
Long distance 
45mph 35 mpg
55mph 33 mpg
65mph 30 mpg
75mph 25mpg
85mph 18mpg

Due to drag it gets better mileage in 40 to 50 mph.

Update after 2 years and 7 month no major problems 

Now 74000miles in the vehicle and still drive like new.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2016,Tony, 04/12/2018,Great Platform Poor Durability,2,"I own  several of these.  Very functional vehicle but I would never buy one again.  These things have a great design for use, more storage, front wheel drive, better gas mileage, but break down all the time.  The worst part is I purchased the 5yr/200k warranty on all of them (9) thinking this would take care of it, however, most dealerships give very little help and sit for days before they can even get looked at.  Each dealer has one guy that works on these, maybe two if it is a big dealer.  Radiator hose is a 3 day wait.  This is a business killer if you have to depend on the vehicle to make money.  They eat headlights like crazy, Ram knows there is a problem but does nothing.  2018 big fix was to no longer have daytime running lights and put manual light switch back in.  Do yourself a huge favor and get something else.   Crazy misdiagnosis repairs all the time.  My current problem is a 2018 with 1511 miles, yes just over a 1500 miles.  ABS/ECM /service engine lights and power loss.  Dealer says.................................It will be a few days before we can look at it.  Never again Ram!

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2016,Kelley H, 09/28/2017,3.0 EcoDiesel,4,"I have had very little issues with mine.  After reading past reviews, maybe commercial use is too tough for them.  Also, if your an employee and don't own it, you drive it like a knocklehead.  I use mine for RV and Motorcycle recreational.   1. The tire sensor problem is not known by most people, but when you rotate the fronts to the rear you must decrease the new fronts pressure and increase the rears pressure or the Sensor light will stay on.  The rears need more pressure because of sensor receivers for the rear and front location are different because of cargo requirements.  2. The side sliding door handle needs a redesign.  If you pull handle in an angle to open instead of pulling straight out before trying sliding it back you will brake plastic lock.  Drivers door hinges and headlight failures are related to vibration from the front end.  The struts are cheapest Fiat could fine.  Don't slam the doors like the old Chevy's and Ford vans.  That will break the window operators especially if you door storage if full.  Radio issues and backup camera.  Just have dealership change the radio out, Its not repairable.  Brakes are pain, yes! But Ram owners have know Ram pickups have always had brake wear issues.  You want brakes go get a Ford Van. No issues with DEF system yet. So far so good.  I would buy another one is I needed.  Looks like the V6 engine is the one to stay away from.

It handles like a (tall) mini-van, runs like a car. Definitely the PEPPIEST Van out there. Great Visibility from the tall comfortable upright drivers seat; Huge windshield, Great (large electric folding) mirrors, Great rear camera. Excellent steering radius; even the biggest version is easy to park. I've owned it for a year and a half and have 30,000 miles on it. I had a bad tail light seal, and the tail light was replaced by RAM under warranty. I have replaced one headlight bulb.. That's it. No problems, no issues. The Promaster gets great mileage, and has no problem passing all the other vans on the highway. Mine is a fully loaded Camper Van, and I am so happy with it, I am seriously considering buying one of the smaller low roof versions as a daily runner. I have no gripes but WOULD like to see a better nav system, and tilt wheel.

UPDATE: At 34,000 miles - STILL love it. I've driven a Sprinter, driven a couple Transits, STILL wouldn't trade the Promaster at any price.

Took a little while to figure out how to work the three stages of the VVT on the new engine but, now that I have, I regularly get over 19 mpg.  Mileage depends highly on speed and wind direction with this beast.  Can be anywhere from 15 to 22 in strong winds at highway speeds.  Never under 15, even going directly into 20 mph headwind in plains. FWD is GREAT for winter driving, and allows vehicle to have lower deck.  Vehicle bounces around empty.  I carry about 1000 pounds payload, which has it stable.  Have had up to 3000 pounds in it and it handles just fine.  Seating is on the high side relative to windows and took getting used to, but like being able to see over the top of SUV's and most pick up trucks.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2016,AndyK, 04/25/2019,No vehicle is perfect,4,"Bought new. I don't expect too much from the vehicles I buy as long as it gets the job done for me. I am a locksmith with pretty heavy load in the back all the time.  After almost 50k miles, no major problem. When people have issues with their car usually they are quick to say bad about it then praise the other vehicles.  Guess what, the owners of other vehicles do the same, Ford Chevy etc. Anyways the pros I see: 1. Great narrow turning radius because it's front wheel drive. I have Ford van truck dodge van. This van let's me make turn in one shot where I have to try twice with other vehicles. Uconnect is decent that my customers have no issue hearing me while I drive. Backup camera is a must. Awesome. 
There other pros but other cars have too so I am not gonna mention them all.  Cons : yes you guessed it right! Headlight bulb. Mine lasted longer than the other people I guess but when it went out I got the led bulbs( you have to modify fitting some how to make it work) and they work great except it gives a lot of noise in the radio. I learned I have to put ferrite sleeves to reduce noice. I have not done that yet, I am too lazy. It has no effect on hands free talking. Door contact sensor seems to be off somewhat that when I thought the sliding door is completely shut and then lock the door using the remote I often find that the passenger door not locked because the side door. Now I make sure everything is locked. Somewhat inconvenient.  Gas mileage is not great but regardless of which brands and models it takes certain amounts of energy to move the weight and all the Van's I drove gave me about the similar mileage so not too disappointed. Can't compare to Ford transit or sprinter since I haven't dove those but I wish they came out with V8 engines because it revs quite a bit when I drove up to Lake Tahoe when the van was brand new and no cargo in the back.

Looks too much like an ambulance. I went to a local Ford Dealer and the first Transit 2500  I looked at had a recall notice on it so it couldn't be sold. The dealer didn't have a basic Transit 2500 on the lot but the sales guy called me the next day and said he found one not too far away. In the meantime, I started reading reviews and looking closer at the Transit and there were just too many things like having the parking break in the middle between the two seats and countless breakdown issues that I just did not want any part of. I decided to head down to our local Dodge dealer and look at the Promaster 2500 HIgh Roof. They had one on the lot. I took it for a test drive and really liked it. I got in easy, backup camera and sensors were great. Got it with power mirrors that fold in. Apparently, the dealers order only a few configurations of the van so if you want to build one yourself, they said it would take about 4 months to get. I took advantage of the rebates and got it out the door for around $34,000. It had about $1500 worth of upgrades. I didn't need navigation, floor mats and a bunch of extra stuff. The LED lights would have been nice but I am going to get that aftermarket anyway. The only ridiculous thing I found so far is that the passenger seat doesn't have an armrest. Reall happy with the purchase. I have only had it 4 days now so the good thing is that nothing has fallen off the van yet that I know of! It's big and beautiful... just hope I won't be moving furniture for my friends every weekend :(

The check engine light came on at about 5k miles along with a message saying DEF - go to dealer. The dealer gave me a rental car and had it fixed and out the doors in 2 days; new def pump and also a new tire sensor that had the light lit on the dash. This is a big vehicle and the diesel has been getting between 25-28 mpg for personal use, lightly loaded (very little city driving.) The first gear is very high but I quickly adjusted. It turns well for it's size; I can make u-turns at the lights. Brakes are amazing. I am pleased with it.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2017,Preacher, 11/28/2018,Electrical Nightmare!,2,"My van from the time I bought it in June of 2017 has been an electrical night mare.  I have had a module replaced, headlights bulbs replaced, bulb on top of cab 6replaced, body ECM module replaced, warning lights coming on in the instrument panel, and other problems.  I called Promaster and they know about these problems but they aren't doing a recall.  The Promaster Rep told me this module has been on Service Call since January of this year.  My van has been to the dealership 5 times and it still isn't fixed.  The dealership told me they were going to have to bring in a Specialist from Promaster.  I am fed up with these issues.  My van is the best driving van I ever had only if I could keep driving it.  Preacher I was just given this number by Promaster Service Rep 18883274236.  This number goes to an organization called NHTSA.   This organization is the ones who file recalls.  I ask anyone that has a problem with their Promaster to call the number above.  Out of 125 reviews I have found 98 % of the consumers have had the very same problem I am having."
ram,promaster-cargo-van,2017,Rade, 11/07/2018,Just wanted to add ...,2,"Before you buy this van read all bed reviews and run away because I wanted to feel pleasure driving everyday in my new van, instead its very anoying. I still have 2 ford e350s with over 150000 mile that start and drive smother then new PRO MASTER. I am not joking. Instead I decided to buy one with 10k miles. So far from all above reviews I didn't experience bulb changing yet. Don't get me wrong, I love this van. Great cargo space, good handling, ok gas mileage( i am electrical contractor and don't have to many things in the back and get around 14 miles per galon. Price more affordable then ford vans I drove for years and swear by them.  This is stuff that happened to me in less then 10k miles: -First 15 second in the morning are very shaky and rough for engine(starts like some used cars after 100k miles). Coolant leak on coolant bottle that was changed under warranty and still leaking on the radiator(common issue with this vans, they told me at dealer place) and should be changed under warranty. And yes, they have only one certified guy in this place and wait time is over two to tree weeks just to get appointment. Transmission wait time is at least 2 to 4 weeks (dealers information because I have transmission issues already with 19000 miles). Started as big kick once,that I was thinking that's it, I am not moving any more. After that one started to kicking when you put it in drive or reverse, then same day I lost 4th and 5th speed. I head to park on side of road and shut it of, turned it on and then went away and started shifting again, and yes I tried to move to manual shifting mode before I stoped but it would not do anything(it would stay in D on the dash). Couple of days after same big kick in between 1st and 2nd gear. Just today alternator started acting. When key is turned you would hear only click and nothing would happened for first couple of times. It looks like brake fluid is leaking because when I go down the hill brake warning turns on(low oil level). Back door don't close on lower side all the time(stay lose every 4th time). Very rough shifting from first to second and 4th to 5th and 6th specially after downshifting.  Forget about complaints about bad layout of coffee holders and crazy downshifting when you go down the hill or missing telescoping tilt (weird position of the steering wheel). Second time since I bought it I was at the dealer, there is no transmission codes, there is some for not being able to turn on the engine. So I have to go back there Monday morning. I am sure that this will probably be the last Chrysler vehicle in my life because I experienced more problems in 9000 miles than ever before in my life. Every time I sit in my new van I think what is next. Very stressful. Hopefully you will be smarter or you will suffer because of your decisions. Good luck.
Update-January, 2019. Story does not end here :).
Clicking noise of alternator almost left me in the customer driveway because because van did not want to start. So after over 50 tries finally did start the engine and I got back to my driveway where after another couple of days and another 100 tries did start and I took it to the dealer. Same story at dealer that they are over the roof with vans and one technician. Took them almost two weeks to replace starter that was bad and replace leaking radiator and I've been told that they did not have time to check transmission because there is to many vans in. Ok, I got my van back and couple of weeks after I still lose coolant and have drop of my van today back to the dealer. Transmission bucking is even worst and I experienced noise couple of times again and just wait for the day when it is going to give up. My current mileage is 21700 and I am already thinking how to get rid of this van because I just don't trust it.

The other one has had so many little issues its annoying, no radio currently as that is the latest thing to break. oh and also have to replace headlight bulbs every 5,000 miles, driving home with no headlights at night is SO FUN! And you have to take it to a dealer that can work on them not just any Ram dealership can. Save your money and time! The biggest issue is That it is UNDER WARRANTY and this company REFUSES TO STAND BEHIND THEIR WARRANTY ON THEIR PRODUCT!!! AVOID AT ALL COST
"
ram,promaster-cargo-van,2017,ATEC, 04/08/2018,"I own 9 of these. Run away, Run away, Run away.",2,"I am a fleet owner and purchased several of these because they are very functional with a great overall design and platform.  They safely handle a lot of weight and have superior freight space.  They are actually kind of fun to drive because you are setting way up high like an old flat nosed tractor.  They are front wheel drive and do pretty good in the snow and ice and gas mileage is far superior to the others.  So it sounds great right?, so why the poor review?  What a piece of JUNK!  Headlight bulbs are about every 6 weeks, headlight capsules melting right onto the bulbs at the tune of a $1000 per occurrence.  The factory built in Jake brake is so overly sensitive that even empty on the slightest of down grades it is downshifting abruptly and the rpms shoot up to 4500.  There is coolant loss that apparently is impossible to detect?  Lifter knock will form around 85,000 miles faithfully.  I have had so many problem with these I know the Ram customer care rep by name and memorized her extension.  I put 200k bumper to bumper warranties on them at the tune of $5,000 each, which is great but between actually trying to get them in for service within 3 to 4 days, waiting for parts for days and crazy expensive repairs it is a constant nightmare and almost not even worth it.  Then once they are repaired they try to get out of warranty by saying it is maintenance or normal wear and tear.  In general Ram dealers are the pits for service work, usually only having 1 or maybe 2 techs who are even ""certified"" to work on the Promaster.    The worst is Ram knows these problems exist and take no responsibility or have figured out any fixes for it.  I have a dealer service bulletin I ""acquired"" outlining the problem but they refuse to recall it.  The 2018 engineering marvel to remedy the problem..... they eliminated the daytime running lights and put the old headlight manual on and off switch.  Ram customer care will help pay for the premature repairs a couple times but after one or two you are on your own.  I am not brand loyal, and had no preconceived brand bias one way or the other.  It is on very seldom occasion that I leave reviews on any products, but the Promaster is deeply flawed when it comes to durability.  I have a few Ford Transits, the cargo space in narrower, they are rear wheel drive and about 2-3 miles per gallon less but very reliable.  The 2016 Transit that has 305,000 miles on it has had less cost in repairs then the 2017 Promaster with 45,000 miles.   Chevy Cutaways are bulky with poor gas mpg but cheap, quick and easy to fix.  The Chevy Cutaways typically need transmissions at about 150k miles, but they are readily available and takes about 5 hours at the dealership (GM crate one installed for about $3200 - $3700) I will not be buying another Promaster and I hope this review helps any business owner out there make a better choice for your business needs.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2017,Frank, 04/27/2019,No Pro Master,1,"Bought two 2017 1500 high roof brand new for plumbing business in NYC. Consecutive Vin #'s. Both now around 10,000 miles. Both had numerous headlight failures. Roof lights also failed on both. Some parts are not available yet. Both have horrible gas mileage around 7mpg not fully loaded. Horrible in the snow or wet roads. They lurch forward when trying to accelerate. Transmission shifts sound like a hammer against steel. One has now been at the dealer for repair for a month. The emergency brake linkage came apart. Truck was stuck in customers driveway blocking her from getting kids from school. My plumber had to crawl underneath and was able to dislodge. How embarrassing. Would never ever buy Dodge again. Switched from Chevy because we needed the high roof that Chevy doesn't have yet. The repair dealer White Plains Dodge is great and honest. Unfortunately they are working on a crappy product. The only good things about these trucks are the room in front and back, the 3 seat option, and the windshield view. Can't find anything else nice to say. Totally disappointed. Stay far away from Promaster.
Update: 5/6/19. Ram corporate just called me back. My truck has been at the dealer for e-brake since 3/29/19. Corporate just said the part should be in 7/10/19. 4 months without truck @ $577 per month. They won't guarantee a rental reimbursement. Next call is to Consumer Affairs, Attorney General etc.

Back in 2017 there were not a bunch of reviews yet to warn consumers about the trash being made by FCA. Now there are hundreds of thousands of enlightened consumers about the promaster junk. I'm surprised it gets 2 stars but that is due to the FCA rumor control and whats left of marketing. Very soon they will need to take every one of these to the scrap pile for recycling. Maybe then it will be worth something. For anyone who still has doubts about this mistake of a van just take some time to read reviews, there are thousands of them....

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2018,David Khat, 07/10/2018,Worse van ever.,1,"This announcement is in regards to the 2018 Dodge ProMaster Ram. We are an experienced and established logistic company with a fleet of 160 cargo vans contracted with several companies. In the past, we have used several cargo brands such as Ford, Chevy, and Nissan. Recently, our leasing agent has switched us to the 2018 Dodge ProMaster Ram. Immediately from the first month of service, we have encountered countless problems that we have never experience before when using other make and models. 

The two main issues are mechanical and vehicle structure within less than 700 miles. 

The mechanical issues we have dealt with are the following, 
Serpentine belt, controls several important part of the vehicle such as AC, alternator, and power steering. The serpentine belt comes off which is not normal, and we are unable to prevent this issues.
Transmission, the vehicle does not shift properly or not at all and the gears disconnect leading to rolling of the van which has lead to an accident in our fleet which has totaled another vehicle. The shifter in the vans are loose and/or becoming loose. 
Within the first 3000 miles, the front tires bald without reason which is abnormal as well. 

The structure issue is the door handle hinges. The door handle hinges mounted to the frame are weak and snap out regularly making it unable to open and the hinges actually break off the van. 


In January and February 2018, we made a formal complaint to Dodge through out leasing company. We had two visits from two different Dodge personnel and discussed the issues state above. During the visits, the Dodge personnel admitted to being aware of the hinge issues. Dodge personnel offered to only assist us to the mechanical issues, transmission and serpentine belt. However, they have not fixed the vehicles thoroughly, and are continuously being serviced. Within Dodge service, we are not reimbursement or given an incentive for the down time these vehicles are being serviced. The front tires and structural issues are still being overlooked. 

This announcement is to bring attention to all consumers to not invest in 2018 Dodge ProMaster Ram. Your money and safety are at risk. .....

We will be switching to a chevrolet custom up fitted van and it may not be as friendly for customers but at least it won’t be sitting in the shop for 2 weeks of every month.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2018,Bob the Musicguy, 02/21/2020,Solid and versatile,4,"I’ve been driving this van for almost two years now as a service rep in the music industry.  Routinely, I do about 35,000 miles a year and currently have 53,000 miles on the van.  For the capacity (2500 extended high roof), the MPG has been outstanding at 18.3mpg average over the 53,000 miles.

I’ve not had any mechanical issues except for one: They shop that put in the aftermarket trailer brake controller put a screw through a wire.  It didn’t cause issues at first, but after several thousand miles it caused an intermittent short that left me dead on the road.  I can’t directly blame RAM for that fault but I will say that it is foolish that RAM makes a van with this towing capacity but doesn’t offer a factory trailer brake option.

With the addition of a lumbar support cushion, I find the van to be very comfortable.  Yes, it rides like a cargo van, but it’s actually not as rough as most 2500 pickups I’ve driven.  The heater and A/C keep up just barely when your driving on a day in the extremes. Where I’m at that means anywhere from 0 to 100 degrees.  As a driver, my only real complaint is that the passenger A pillar is a HUGE blind spot at intersections.  This has caused a few close calls.

I have towed a 7x14 enclosed double axle trailer weighing about 5,000lbs when loaded and the van does just fine with it.  Due to the van blocking the wind, I still get a remarkable 13.5mpg towing this trailer at 70mph on a calm day.  I’ve towed it maybe 3000 miles and not had any issues.  Just remember that you’re towing a trailer in a big van: you won’t do jackrabbit starts.

All in all, I’m very pleased with this van for the work that I do.  I see a lot of negative reviews here on them and the negative reviews far outweigh the positive ones.  I’m not sure if this is because these are prone to issues or whether it’s because people are more likely to comment if their experience is negative.  My experience has been almost 100% positive so I think it is probably the latter.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2018,Yani, 10/11/2018,"After 40,000 miles",5," It's been 24 months living with the promaster and all is good, mileage has suffered as a result of Minnesota winter, about 15-16MPG with mornings warm up. Other wise all is good, riding in a tin box full of tools is not a joy, so I hung two moving blankets between the cargo area and the front which quieted  things down  a lot, also helps with AC and heat. Love all the room!  I’ve had two issues one was a factory recall which was no problem and I had a leaky radiator which was replaced under warranty all good. I’m now shopping for a new set a tires and plan to use the van another year or two before I trade it in. I am a Landlord and I do a lot of my own repairs and turnovers, so one day I may be mowing grass, the next day I may be fixing a sink, or remodeling an apartment and hauling building materials. The van has great cargo room, I can drive my 46"" riding mower right into the back, or wheel in a new fridge and not have to lay it on it's side. I have installed Dewalt toughsystem racks that hold all my tools, and fold away when I need the extra cargo room. On the highway I average 22 MPG, combined city highway I average 17.5. The van is easy to drive, great visibility, plenty of power to get onto the highway, great bluetooth feature, good by commercial radio. The radio turns on with out the key which is nice, the dual locking system is harder to get use to, one button to lock, but one button for cargo area and another for cab access. Great van, ride is a little rough, but it's a cargo van, not a limo.

Definitely the most spacious of any van I’ve been in.  Smooth ride, handles well for its size, and muscles up hills when fully loaded.  Very reliable and mechanically sound. Maintenance and oil changes are dirt cheap (I change my oil for $50, a Mercedes cost $300, couldn’t imagine repairs, no brainer).  These vans are a great answer to the Mercedes Sprinter which I’ve heard first hand have plenty of costly issues.  All in all a fantastically reliable vehicle.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2019,John, 12/30/2019,Great for utility horrible to drive + hour,3,"I bought it to haul my off road motorcycles and it works very well for that purpose. Fuel mileage is decent at about 13.5 in the city and 18.5 on longer road trips. My complaint is it is the most uncomfortable vehical I have ever driven. The wheel won't tilt and sits at a strange angle and the seat has one low set arm rest with the door bolster too far away to sit straight up and down with my arm on.  I find myself leaning towards the door so my arm rest on the bolster and also forward to hold the wheel and end up in pain after an hour. I have taken it on 2 four hour trips and it takes days for me to recover.  I now constantly correct my leaning and just hold my left arm out so my back is better but my shoulders cramp so I started putting a pillow between me and the door, it helps. It's a 45,000 dollar vehical that I have had for 3 weeks and I am looking for aftermarket steering collum, door bolsters and seats and will pay what ever it takes when I find then. So it is great as far as utility and would be wonderful if I did not need to drive it further that 10 miles. Drivers erganomics are by far the worst I have ever experienced. I really regret not buying a ford transit.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2019,Dan, 07/19/2019,Safety Nightmare!,1,"Second update: Edmunds wanted another update. Well it's still a nightmare. You can add incompetent dealer service to the list. They repaired the mirror, but could not find the fuel system issue claiming they went to a gas station to try it. (They did not.) They did a tire rotation and didnt reset the TPMS. They left the fronts inflated to 80 psi, then changed the rears to 62 psi. (Why? Trying to get the tpms light to clear? What a random pressure.) The rears should be 80 and the fronts 42. I had to fix this myself. The service manager ignored my calls so the light stays on. The slider door does not latch unless you slam it, and you have to put some force into closing the rear doors also. In case i did t mention it, there's an active recall for the shift control becoming detached and the trans would stay in the last gear you selected, so no park. 

First update:
I was asked by Edmunds to update my review: well all of the below still stands. Winter driving is useless and trying to get out of driveways with a slight rise at the road such as roadside ditches are dangerous as you cannot stop to look unless you want to back up and try agsin. The driver side heated mirror is inop and i'm still having problems filling the tank due to poor venting. The windshield easher nozzles stick up in the wiper area and have very weak clips. I cannot use a snow brush here or else they will fall off. So yes. This vehicle is still a nightmare on wheels after more time getting used to it.

Original Review: 

So I just got one of these vans issued to me for work. The front wheel drive shudders in reverse going uphill unless you give it a lot of gas. To reach most things in the cab, you have to reach for them which is dangerous while driving. Cup holders, cruise control, hazards, radio dials. The driver side mirrors are obstructed by the pillar in the window (which doesn't roll all the way down.)  The steering wheel doesn't tilt but does extend. (part of the linkage is exposed at your feet.) You're sitting so high up, it feels like you're driving a bus. The 12v plug only works when the van is running. The radio doesn't remember your last input setting. (Playing from USB or bluetooth? When you start the van again, it starts playing from the radio. There is no way to turn off your headlights and leave your parking lights on. Cruise has to be enabled after starting the van each time. I feel like I'm going to snap off the front doors since the stop in the hinges does not line up until the door already feels like it's bending. The mirrors are power folding and all 4 do have power adjust. (Why did they include a rear view mirror with solid rear cargo doors?) The reverse camera is a nice feature. It does have good cargo space and my 6'3"" self can climb in the back comfortably. (Short height van) The sliding door helps when I have to park in a parking spot and still get at tools. The cabling to the rear cargo doors does seem like a future point of failure. The rear axle does not provide much ground clearance. There is a very basic light in the rear cargo area that is all but useless. There is no third brake light likely due to how wide it is. The cab and cargo door locks are two different buttons and you cannot program your horn to honk to indicate it's locked. The gas tank doesn't always fill to full and the gas door is flimsy plastic.  I'm sure there's more I forgot, but here's a book to read to get you started.

ram,promaster-cargo-van,2019,Darryl R., 05/22/2019,Ram shopping for unwanted bundle packages.,3,"I  have been shopping for a Ram Promaster Cargo Van 150 or 250 high top, either with a 136 or 159 inch w/b. I want speed control, rear door glass, key fobs and back up aid. If I was going to pay for stuff just to jack up the price give me swivel seats, the larger generator, the 12 volt rear plug and trailer hitch package or the alarm system. However all Ram wants to sell is stuff I really am not interested in like aluminum wheels, fancy grill, side wall paneling, wood floor, appearance group and the like. Who needs most of this stuff in either a work or recreation vehicle? Your not making me want to buy your product, your telling me to shop your competitor to get what I want and not pay for what I don't what. Not a van within 500 miles of what I want. You make a van to appeal to practical needs and mess it up thinking it should be dressed up like a luxury car which it is not. You're as bad as the phone service providers wanting to make bundle packages that is driving landline users to pull the cord. No wonder more Transits sell than Promasters. You just don't get it.

ram,promaster-city,2015,Chris, 11/09/2015,Nice little van,5,"I have purchased a 2015 Promaster City. I looked at the Nissan Nv200 And the Chevy City Express. The Chevy is just a rebadged Nissan and they want you to pay for them doing that at around 2k more.  I test drove the Nissan twice. Not a bad little van , but I could tell it was best designed for the city, and no tow rating.  The Nissan is slow. What got me on the Ram was 50 more horsepower. Got it with a factory trailer hitch rated to tow 2000lbs. So it can tow my 4 wheeler to play on the weekends, ect. Plus the ram drives so much better. 80mph down the highway at just over 2k rpm. Nice. Only have 2000 miles on it and averaging 27 highway and 21 city loaded with probably 500 pounds of tools. Also very stable in winds, handles like a car. So far so good. the transmission is a little strange, as well as the gas pedal is touchy, quarter throttle acts like its floored, But overall I can get used to that for the trade off in towing and performance.

ram,promaster-city,2015,Al Tuttle, 05/11/2019,Great Economy Delivery Van,4,"Model Promaster City SLT Cargo Van.  This is a mini delivery van.  Great interior cargo capacity -space and weight.  Hinged rear doors release to open more than 90 degrees - really helps.  Sliding side doors provide adequate access Space is obtained at the cost of sound proofing - so you get road noise - recommended high tire pressure (42 psi) may also contribute to noise.  Tight handling and steering with good braking. Better than expected acceleration out of 2.4L engine and 9 speed auto transmission.. Great gas mileage - Average around 28 MPH for WV Country Rd driving.  Taking it easy on the flat - have gotten as high as 32 MPH.  No problems in snow or muddy gravel roads with all season tires, but didn't push it.  Have encountered ground clearance problems on rutted/cratered WV back country roads - but not a problem on ""normal"" roads.Lots of nooks for storing  -doors and overhead bin.  A little tight between seats- cup holders too small dia. Seats firm but adequate adjustments, including lumbar support.  Without windows on the side sliding cargo doors, it is difficult to see traffic coming from the right at intersections that are more than 90 degrees (over your shoulder - true for any windowless van).  Otherwise visability front and side good. Rear camera and backup warning helps. In 2015 model, speedometer is difficult to see on sunny days, especially if wearing sunglasses.  On third set of tires 48K, and original brakes. (put new tires on for last winter - replaced 2nd set still had about 1/2 wear.)  One electrical problem with rear wiper switch required replacement of control module for all switches/controls on the steering wheel/column (under warranty).  Only other maintenance - oil, filters, and alignments.  AC is just adequate, Night time high beams exceptional.

ram,promaster-city,2016,Wendy F, 09/14/2016,What can't my Promaster City Wagon do?,5,"I love my Promaster City Wagon. In bright yellow, I might add. It looks like a little bread truck/caution sign driving down the road but I am so happy inside. I have to say that I am trading in two cars for this one PMC wagon: a 1998 Toyota Tacoma with camper shell, and a 1995 Chevy Lumina minivan. I like a car with great utility and a car that I can sleep in on road trips. My old truck and van were each really good in their own way. But my new PMC Wagon tops them both--as a hybrid truck/van monster. Obviously my review is being written by someone that drove a Tacoma and an old van--not a Lexus so my needs for comfort and luxury may be somewhat less than yours, but here is what I think.  This car is so fun to drive and so comfortable that I have no idea that I am in a cargo van -- except for the fact that it holds boat loads of stuff. It accelerates quickly -- too quickly if you want to watch your gas mileage, it handles and turns very well. It stays on the road. I can pass ANYONE on the highway, and often do. No trouble getting up to speed to merge onto the highway either. The seats are comfortable in the SLT with the extra lumbar support. It is true, you do have to crank the recliner knob and it is a bit slow, my old Lumina van was the same way. The front seats go so far back that you can sleep in them just fine. I am 6'2"" and find so much leg room up front that I don't have to put the seat all the way back (never happens in other cars). If you don't want to sleep in the front seat then tumble half the back seat forward and sleep diagonal on the floor (if you're under 6' tall you don't have to sleep diagonal).  It can come with satellite radio and has a great entertainment/computer console with buttons integrated into the steering wheel, built-in hands-free phone calls with bluetooth. Someone complained about not having a CD player. Well any smart phone or mp3 device will hook right up to the radio console with USB or bluetooth.  Tons of head room, you can put your arms straight up and wave them around. Way cool overhead storage and clever bottle holders in the door pockets. Good, solid construction. Sliding doors are light and very slidey with very clever handles. I love the simplicity and design of the door handles and latches and the combination door handle/lock button in the front seats. Cavernous front seating area with wide angle view. I want to drive this thing to Alaska to see the wide open scenery. I think it is quiet. I know it is quiet compared to my Tacoma (which is a noisy little truck) and even compared to the Lumina. Even during a wind storm, I did not feel that the van was too tall or got too much wind noise or battering around. Note that it is wider than your average minivan. A wider track like a jeep might be helping to avoid that too-tall feeling. It corners like a car, not like a van. I have almost 5,000 miles on it so far and no mechanical problems yet (knock on wood). I am getting about 24 mpg in town and more like 26 on the highway. Best mileage in 9th gear (85mph and 30 mpg).  I have not tried it in the snow yet. As a front wheel drive I expect it will do OK, but we'll see. It has a quick disconnect battery! Seriously, you just pull up a big pin. I have been waiting for that for years. My first car was a Studebaker (no I am not that old...the car was older than me) and I loved my Studebaker because of the simple, functional design. I feel like I have finally bought another Studebaker. You can't beat the combination of price and utility (and I suspect, but we don't know yet because it is a new model...reliability). Driver fatigue is very low in this car due to comfort. The speedometer is oddly off to the left of the dashboard (not centered) and I don't think the trip computer allows you to show a digital speed which would be handy. What you see in front of you is the date and some other trip info. I
 think this is funny because the date doesn't change--all day long. But maybe if you're using this as a work van and have to sit in that front seat and do paperwork, you'll appreciate knowing where to find the date? I had wanted to buy a car with automatic climate control, but this car did not have that option. I must say I really don't spend much time fiddling with the temperature controls in this truck anyway. There is an unfortunate blind spot where the panels are in the back/sides that prevents you from seeing, in parking lots, if someone is approaching the back of your car from the side. But a backup camera, and audible object detection system help with that. So my complaints are way fewer than the things that I love about the car. I get compliments often about its looks and potential versatility. My old parents find it easy to get in and out of both the front and back seats, it has a low step-in height than most trucks and a higher seat height than most cars. I consider it a FWD SUV, for on-road adventure; a mini, dry camper; a daily driver; and a cargo hauler.

ram,promaster-city,2016,Lostrminds, 07/11/2016,Promaster City Wagon SLT,5,"Sitting at home late one night researching minivans on YouTube.  Thank goodness I ran across the Ram Promaster City Wagon. The wife wanted stown'go style mini. That was enough to make me throw up but this van was interesting.  We had looked at and drove C, D, H, K & T vans, did I miss any? Sure they had the stuff but they carried the average $33k+ price tag. Two weeks later a new Ram City Wagon SLT in our drive. A great bang for the buck. 
  Now owning our Ram Promaster City Wagon SLT for almost 3 weeks now with 2400 miles on the clock. I can say we love it.  Ride, handling, gas mileage and interior space is fabulous.  
  Our wagon had a long list of options from heated seats, backup camera w/ rear audible sensors, fog lamps, aluminum wheels, electric windows and doors (child proof lock outs in rear for windows & doors too), adjustable steering wheel, electric adjustable heated mirrors, rear wiper/washer with defroster and the Uconnect radio which is far superior than our Mylink on our GM. The front overhead storage shelf is Awesome, too. For the cup/bottle holder baby crowd: front doors 2, rear doors 1 and center console 2 that's a total of 8. 
 Head room, shoulder, leg room up front and back is great. The front doors offer easy access to the front seats which are equipped with turn knobs to adjust seat recliner with lumbar support. Boohoo no lever. Passenger has recliner knob. The rear sliding doors open to expose rear seats that tumble forward in 60/40 fashion. 60 on drivers side 40 on passenger side but are non-removable. Putting our toddler in his car seat with ease, no issues with banging your head, bending over straining your back and easy access to adjust that car seat. Also each rear seating position (3) has the LATCH System to install a child's car seat.  
  Cabin safety I see front air bags, front bucket seats tagged with airbag equipped and side curtain airbags front and rear, too.  I read something about knee protection: not sure if that means airbag or just the design of the lower dash. Other safety items that seem standard on every vehicle I assume need to be stated: antilock brakes, skid control, hill assist. 
  A personal not on safety I've read the professional reviewers complain of ""NO"" 3rd row seat: thank goodness! I've witnessed a few highway rear ended accidents in my day and everyone I've witnessed are automobiles that get smashed into the back to the rear window.  It is in my personal option a tragedy waiting to happen to place your children or loved ones in a far rear seat/3rd row in any minivan or small SUVs. That could result in your child being (the Bumper) compacted in any type of rear end Collision/accident. As the driver I have a cripple zone in front of me with airbags and a steering to attempt to maneuver but you have limited of no control what so ever when hit from behind. With that in mind why would you place a child in the rear crumple zone!  Explain that to me? Why! A quick internet search will qualify my option. Purchase a full sized van, Suv or a bus.  
  The rear cargo doors are also 60/40 opening to 90 or 180 degrees they offer easy low height access to the rear cargo area which is  carpeted with 4 anchoring points and shallow built-in side shelving on both sides.  Rear cargo area is roughly 49"" between wheels by 52"" with seats up and 67"" with seats folded. Stack that firewood, carry mulch, toss in the dog or pickup your groceries with no worries of damaging your interior cargo area, no fancy trim just space. 
 Our gas mileage is averaging 26.8.  Nice pickup, great cruising on the highway. Set cruise at allowable speed and the motor and 9 speed automatic handles it nicely. If you want to control your shifts tap the gear selector to manual and take control of that 9 speed gear box. 
  Handling on the winding  roads at posted limit to me is sure footed and pleasant. In our area we have many
 unpaved, washboard, loose gravel roads it performs satisfactorily stays were pointed. I've driven auto cross in my Alfa, motorcycles, snowmobiles and boats. Is it my Alfa Spider no but it's not a barge either. Fun would be the word with manners. 
  Interior noise seems to be a topic of concern. It's a van! Well we both think our Ram interior is as quiet as our 2014 Chevy extended super quiet cab. Nice sounding 6 speaker stereo, free satellite radio for a year, flawless Bluetooth hookup and iTunes no problem. Two 12volt plugs between the seats and one in the rear driver side also near the shifter a usb and audio input for your phone. 
 I personally like the look of the wagon. I've fielded many questions from I suppose similar minded folks at almost every stop: gas station, grocery and even the highway rest area. I'm willing to shown'tell but the wife not so much. 
  Our dealer was superb out of Warren PA.  Hats off to Cory and Troy.  Best ever experience I've ever had!  Out the door with the exterior and interior protection treatments and a Michelin tire swap w/nitrogen came in rig

ram,promaster-city,2016,D. R., 06/13/2018,The worst vehicle I have ever owned.,1,"Every time I take it to the shop for repair (2-3 times a year), it’s like buying this piece of junk van all over again. If you like paying way too much for repairs that are needed way too often... needing an alignment as often as an oil change (Expensive oil changes in general), riding around in seats that are like torture devices, and having a digital transmission that causes whiplash every time it changes gears, then this is the vehicle for you!  Thank you RAM, for ramming me into poverty.  Repeatedly. Almost any vehicle will now seem luxurious after this one.


Update!

Had a 2000 dollar fix in May of 2018 to replace the front axel. 

December of same year:  the coolant thermostat crapped out and a replacement thermostat cost 500 dollars by itself.

May 2019-   Air vents started misting coolant in at me.  Went to  dealership to get the heater core replaced ($900) the car promptly broke down on the interstate and I had to get towed back... coolant drenching everything.  EVEN THE SUPER EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE TERRIBLY BUILT.  The dealership fixed it up... but left it in such a mess that I couldn't actually tell whether or not it was fixed (Coolant still dripping on everything) until I took it to a different dealership where they charged me $130 just to tell me whether it was fixed or not.

June - 2020  -  the slow death of my vehicle and wallet continue.
Sway bar links had to get replaced... somehow one of the replacements even ends up being defective.  It's like the pro master city's natural state is to be broken.

What will fall off next?  When will the money run out to repair this pothole with wheels?  Stay tuned for more exciting adventures in pro disaster city...  the anti-herbie.

ram,promaster-city,2016,Mark, 01/30/2018,Not a fan,3,"My first review was on 11/1/16 shortly after purchasing this vehicle. I was unsure of my feelings about it but now I can honestly say I do not like this van. one of my complaints early on was the acceleration. It's a peppy vehicle but the gas petal is way to sensitive and acceleration from a stand still is inconsistent. I've had the vehicle long enough to have gotten used to driving it but sometimes I step on the gas and the van accelerates normally. Other times it moves too quickly and there are times when it seems like it doesn't respond at all. Not a good feeling in busy traffic. Then there is the brake issue I mentioned in my first review. The issue still exists and RAM has no plans to do anything about it. I guess it's not an expensive enough vehicle for them to care about. Every morning when I leave for work my brakes screech like crazy due to the cheap metal they used on the drums and they rust overnight. Either that or the pads have a high metal content and the metal in them rusts. The screeching does go away after driving the vehicle and making a number of stops to ""grind"" the rust away. On a rainy day I can get thru the screeching period, drive for a while until I reach my destination, get back in the van a few hours later and the brakes screech all over again. This is unacceptable! Since my last review I have realized that this van handles bumps horribly. I have a 12 year old pickup that rides better than this thing. Now I am having electrical/transmission issues and am actually waiting for the local RAM service tech to call me back to arrange to have the van towed for them to evaluate/repair the issue. Maybe it's just my vehicle as I do see positive reviews but I am not happy with it.

ram,promaster-city,2016,G.Brown, 09/23/2016,Renting to see if worth it,4,"I've rented this van 3 times now and until this current time, I noticed some comfort features lacking. First off, I'm a repair guy, own a Avalanche truck, can pack all my tools and pull a trailer no problem,  MPG is my problem.  So, first time I rented one was December of 2015, right after they came out. I also have a catering company and my truck was in the shop. It handled my equipment well and I was pleased. Second time, I had to pack my daughter for college and drive about 500 miles,  I got about 27mpg, and that was mostly freeway.  This last time, I noticed things that I hadn't before; lack of 2 arm rest. Seems like that should be common place, especially for a cargo van. The ability to rest your arms on the door arm rest area, it's just a bit too far away, your forearm is on it but your elbow is off, and if you shift towards the door, your ""rear"" is riding on the high part of the seat. The gear shifter positioning doesn't allow for your phone to be stored close by. Yes there's a flat area on the dashboard but a middle consule area would be great.  The two cup holders between the front seats, the one in the rear is really a pain for either driver or passenger,  not convenient.  You definitely have to get a suction cup phone holder if using your phone for GPS,  no place to see it otherwise. Overhead storage bin is great, I'm able to put my ""classic construction clipboard "", wallet, bag of chips, etc up there no problem. Side doors open easily,  rear doors are great. If you're packing / moving, which I did for my daughter,  I suggest similar size boxes, that way everything fits nice and tight. Setting the tripometer is kinda a pain until you get use to it, it's on the wiper or blinker handle at the end, so you have to push it in and cycle to your option. The lumbar/ recline knob is really a pain in the.. .Seriously,  you have to wrap your left hand down and around while rotating the knob. It is a bit loud when not loaded.  I've only rented the cargo version,  no second row seats. 12vdc plug in cargo area nice feature. Oh, the 2 plugs in the front are not ""live"" unless key is on, so you can't charge phones/ tablets/ ,etc unless van is on,  kinda bummer. Standard rims and tires are weak. I've been on the search for a van like this for the past year, but unless the Tradesman SLT have more comfort features,  I'm not completely sold. I  do like the towing feature,  which the Chevy and Nissan are not compatible but the Transit is. I'm on the road all day with a co worker, so these minor details are actually major for me.

ram,promaster-city,2016,Mark, 11/01/2016,Still unsure,4,"I needed an extra work vehicle and my brother owns a dealership that does a lot of business with Enterprise Rentals. He offered me this van at what I thought was a great deal. I want to like this van but I really don't know what to think so far. It took me a while to get used to the gas petal. Either I was taking off too fast sending everything in front flying backwards or I would start and then hesitate. Anytime you switch from driving a particular vehicle for a while there is an adjustment period as you get used to the new vehicle. I am getting used to it but not sure if there is a transmission issue. I just can't seem to have a smooth start. I've never had that problem with other vehicles for this long. Also, every morning, especially if it is damp outside, my brakes seem to work too well. I will be maneuvering in our driveway working my way toward the street and every time I just slightly step on the brakes I damn near go thru the windshield. They just stop way to hard. The brakes sound awful too as if they needed to be changed a long time ago and the drum is being grinded by worn pads. My brother's mechanic looked at the brakes and said there is plenty of meat still on the pads. They didn't replace the pads because the only ones they could find were really expensive. Hopefully some aftermarket company starts making some cheaper, better pads soon.I want to like this van. It is peppy and has good cargo area. I suppose I just need to take it to the dealership and have them take a look.

ram,promaster-city,2016,THE PEOPLE'S REVIEWER, 06/12/2020,Money pit!,1,"It's a total disaster on wheels. Only thing going for it is it's looks and spacious cargo area. But no use if it's ALWAYS IN THE SHOP AND DODGE TECHNICIANS CAN NEVER FIND THE PROBLEM. I'm beginning to think that there is some special department that specializes in dodge vehicle repair and all dodge techs call there for guidance and no one ever answers cause they don't know either. Every trip to the DODGE DEALER shop is an overnighter. STAY AWAY!!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. And it's true what my colleagues say about they never haber parts available for this vehicle in particular. Im guessing it's because they're the most in demand for repairs. Oh, I almost forgot, it shakes on solid firm pavement and idle is always rough. Gear shifting is hard and vehicle does pull to the left. I purchased my car used with only 1 year of use in very good condition and its been in the shop most of the time. 

IT'S DEFINITELY A LEMON
"
ram,promaster-city,2016,Chris kline, 03/07/2019,Contractor tested and approved,4,"Very versatile for a small vehicle, snow handling poor. Turn off your traction control if you're stuck. Center console poorly designed but door bottle holders even the score. Needs a digital speedometer. Radio reception is often spotty. I outfitted with dual locking ladder racks, alot of noise but to be expected. Tow hitch and light connector with a 8in. Lift tow adapter works great. Tows smooth, good visibility with mirrors but tranny shift is prolonged,  probably to be expected. Wall mounted tool boxes left and right and a $50 universal rubber mat.  Always buy good seat covers and great floor liners(weather tech) for any vehicle you are going to keep. You won't be disappointed!!! Great value and performance.  There are over a million and a half European cousins of this vehicle driving around.  So it's not really new or untried, just the North American version 2014 to 2015 not so good. Redesigned 2016 to 2017 models seem overall great for the price. Consider the wagon version, even if you want to work out of it. You will get insulation rear seats and a whole lot more options an versatility for a few thousand dollars more. Also bought a full size spare tire with jack and hanger/installation kit for piece of mind, made the dealer pay half. Driving 1110 miles one way in 2 days from now towing a 4x8 harbor freight folding trailer with a  600lb load. Then 20 min to seperate the trailer into two halves that fit into the back of van, preventing me from towing a light/empty trailer 1110 miles back. That's versatility! Smart vehicle saves me gas, repairs and expensive tires for the work truck. Savings comparison to 1/2 ton work truck equal the cost of this van over a 5 year per period. Do the math, you won't be disappointed.

ram,promaster-city,2017,zach berdan, 09/30/2016,"Good value, lots of room.",4,"I was looking for a rig that could haul gear and furniture and double as a recreation vehicle for bike, kayak, camping, etc. with decent gas mpg and fwd. In a word versatility that was fun to drive. I found the Promaster city wagon after the local Ford dealer wasn't even carrying the passenger Ford Transit and the salesman looked at me like I had something growing out of my head. This was the only Promaster City Wagon on the lot so I guess the versatile Eurovan has yet to catch on. I hate the lack of versatility/space in minivans and crossovers b/c of seating and finish. I recently bought this for clearing out an estate and for long trips. It's been a smooth ride so far. There is plenty of head room and room to bed down for the night or long haul. Back seats can be removed to make more room or tumble forward. Ideal for one or two people on a long haul. Lots of cargo space for moving gear and head space and shelf rack above windshield. Cruise control is a must but not standard. The cargo base is a tin can with 2 seats. The city wagon finishes the back with some plastic and fabric/sound dampening. You pretty much pay for anything extra. Decent fit and finish. Be forewarned: here in VT and with insurers it is deemed a truck/commercial vehicle b/c it has a truck base? so costs @$100 more to insure for a year. I am hoping after the break in period to get better mpg. Right now @23 hwy? 4 speaker Stereo is a little tinny but it is nice to take calls and play tunes via bluetooth, a new trick for this old dog, and I like the backup camera. City wagon was in short supply so no break from the msrp. Hard to get the features I wanted, pretty much had to take what is on the lot. Which was an ok set of features, camera, stereo, blutooth, cruise. I was unable to procure the rear defrost and wiper package. Rain driving means using the side mirrors which fold in btw, for parking. So far, so good. Lots of compliments and head turns around town. Good sight lines, though somewhat exposed, like you are driving around in an fish bowl.  Roof rack is extra. Seat is comfortable for a big guy like me. Some have said the drive position is weird, but I don't mind it 33"" arms, 30"" inseam legs. I checked out the videos on line about it first and was happy to see it can haul a modest small size trailer too.

ram,promaster-city,2017,Scott, 05/09/2018,The penalty box,2,"I have been issued this vehicle as a ‘service’ van. It has been the most uncomfortable van I have had during my career. The driver seat is very uncomfortable after about 45 minutes of driving. The cab is cramped with little storage, none behind the seats. Why Chrysler decided that it wasn’t worth the extra $2.00 to equip this with variable speed intermittent wipers is beyond me. In the 33,000 miles that I have driven it so far, it has been in the shop twice for a bad front stabilizer/sway bar. The 2nd visit today and was advised by the dealership that the part is on back order. I suppose they are on back order because of how many they are replacing? Thankfully our fleet vehicles are rotated out after 80,000 miles. I hope and pray that my company doesn’t make the same mistake of selecting this vehicle again.

ram,promaster-city,2017,Todd, 03/04/2019,Family Adventure Wagon,5,"We purchased a new Ram Promaster SLT Passenger Wagon in July 2016. We absolutely love this truck. It was built tough to withstand hard commercial use and built to last. That really appealed to us, as everything is built with long term durability in mind, and it is evident. The truck has proven itself in Europe with over 2 million sold, serving Europeans both as a commercial van and family van. The 2.4 Tiger Shark motor is strong and efficient and also built to withstand constant commercial use, so we felt it would do well long term, with normal family use and it has. It has exceeded all expectations and is so useful and functional. Even in passenger form with the rear seat up and ready for use, we have a cargo area of 4 foot by 4 foot behind that rear passenger seat. It swallows up everything with ease,and you can stack stuff right to the ceiling. It also has proven to be the best vehicle to haul our two large Labrador Retrievers, they have lots of space and it’s so easy for them to get in and out. We found that in Europe Fiat sells a K9 separation barrier, between the cargo area and rear seat, our US version actually has all the slots for it, so we ordered one from a Fiat dealer in the UK, it worked and installed perfectly. It is rated to carry as much weight as most half ton pick-ups, in a much more affordable, practical, efficient design. Ride quality has been excellent and my wife and feel the front seats are the best we’ve ever owned with amazing back support and comfort even in long 12 hour rides. Fuel economy has also been excellent with solid low to mid 20’s in the city and 26-32 on the highway at 80 mph. We live in a mountainous western state and typically average just shy of 30 mpg with the cruise set at 80 and climbing mountains and hills, the nine speed helps achieve that amazing number as does the very slippery aerodynamic design. In 3 years we have had no warranty work and nothing break or need repair. If you use high quality synthetic oil like Amsoil, you can easily get by with one oil change per year. I did find that I get about 3% better fuel economy with 91 octane or better. Cost of ownership has been super low with us basically changing the oil twice so far at a cost of around $80 per change for Amsoil’s best synthetic and their 25K oil filter. It’s almost due for its 3rd oil change, and after that’s complete, we will have spent $240 total maintenance dollars for 36 months of driving. The maintenance schedule is amazing with very little to do outside of oil changes, and basic filters for at least your first 3 years. Overall this vehicle has been amazingly strong and reliable with comfort and amazing utility at a much lower price than a pick-up or Suburban type vehicle. It also has proven to be fuel efficient and easy to maintain with little cost. They built it to stand up to hard commercial use and as a result, we are confident we can drive this for many more years with little concern and low wear and tear. I honestly recommend these to everyone and anyone as we have never had a better more efficient and reliable vehicle. It’s proven, it’s tough, it’s efficient, its comfortable, it’s a no brainer as a family hauler that can also do some real heavy duty hauling. We have driven 14,500 miles with no issues and are very confident of long term reliability, as I have talked to a few local business’s, who have the cargo version and have driven them over 100k already with very little issues. Nice job FCA!

ram,promaster-city,2017,Tim T., 07/26/2019,Good concept with poor execution,2,"City vans are a great idea for companies that don't need full size vans for their deliveries.   However, for them to be useful they need to be reliable and this vehicle is not.    I work for a large healthcare company and all of our branches are experiencing the same problems.   Bad coils, transmission failures, and excessive oil consumption problems.   FCA makes some attractive products but they have always had reliability issues no matter who owns them.

ram,promaster-city,2018,Aceadman, 08/20/2019,Very underwhelming after 2000 miles,2,"I was looking for a simple small cargo van and after driving the Promaster City, Ford Transit Connect, and small Nissan van, I chose the Ram. I have to say that after 2000 miles of driving it, I am distinctly not impressed.

The transmission seems VERY clunky especially at low speeds. With very light acceleration, at very low speeds, it often seems to almost ""sputter"" as thought it's about to stall. For a truck designed for CITY driving, awkward engine performance at LOW speeds is a ridiculous flaw.

Motortrend said it has smooth transmission, but I beg to differ. It feels like it shifts 11 times when accelerating from 0 to 45 from a stop. really awkward and jerky. It really NEVER seems like it's in the correct gear, and I am constantly overriding the automatic transmission downshifting as a rule. 

It has a very rough idle when in gear and stopped. I actually took it back to the dealer in the first week because it seemed broken, but they said that's the way it runs. To me, it shakes worse than my 2003 Subaru Forester, a 16 year old car with issues of its own. Putting it in neutral smooths out the idle but it is still worse than you'd expect in any vehicle in 2018. 

Cargo space is good and exactly what I need, but it does seem a bit cheaply made. The box seems pretty flimsy when you close any door.

Much has been made of the awkward driving position, and I notice it, but it doesn't really bother me. I can adjust to it.

Air conditioner works well as does defroster. Haven't really used the heat yet.

Rubber gasket on rear door peeled off when pulling something out through the back. I got it back on, but I think that's a bad design.

Side doors work well.

The little ""storage"" details are all pretty lousy. But that's no big deal to me. Could EASILY be more ergonomic and usable with really minimal thought and work.

The rear brakes are crazy noisy, when it's empty especially. It sounds like they have no pads in the rear and are ""scraping"" on something rather than slowing the wheels. I thought it might ""break in"" but did not. If I hadn't had the same issue in the one I test drove, I'd think something was wrong.

All in all, the flaws are workable EXCEPT for the transmission/engine performance. It's really annoying and makes the vehicle NO FUN to drive. in 2018, everything should be fun to drive."
ram,promaster-city,2018,David Stephens, 06/30/2019,Underwhelming for business use,2,I've owned this van for 4 months and 8000 miles. My vehicle is set up for cargo use with a partition between the front passengers and rear cargo. This van is to narrow. You are literally shoulder to shoulder with your passenger. At first look the van appears to have ample storage but the storage shelf above the passengers is shallow and useless. The door pockets are big enough but between the seats is a small cup holder and 2 outlets (that died on me recently). Anybody taller than 6ft will have a difficult time finding a comfortable driving position. The engine is strong enough but very loud under moderate acceleration. Fuel economy has not been great. The entertainment system is fine and the back up camera is nice. Just recently the engine has had rough idle upon a cold start which is concerning. Overall I do not recommend this vehicle as I have serious concerns about the reliability. 
ram,promaster-city,2018,Sharon, 11/25/2018,Very poor interior/exterior design,3,"Things I don't like: van is too narrow. gear shift & emergency break situated between driver & passenger, one very small cup holder, very useless indented places to put stuff, almost inaccessible over head shelf, controls for lights etc. in weird places; turn on/off high beams and turn signals come on, wipers only have 3 speeds, poor visibility, and over all construction VERY poor quality- very light & tinny. This is after a week of owning this vehicle. I bought it for the cargo area for farm and art show use, and also needed to be able to carry passengers occasionally. This was the best of the Ford, Chevy/Nissan etc. from what I could find locally.

ram,promaster-city,2018,New England, 12/08/2019,Reliable,4,"Agree with points made previous 3 reviews. I'm in service industry and it has been flawless for first year/25k miles. The manual shift mode-very smooth - is a must to avoid the ""clunky"" performance. The transmission seeks the higher gears too quickly/stays in them too long. I have found the gear that gives you 2000 RPM is the one you want to be in.....5th gear as high as needed driving up to 40mph...even highway driving at 70mph 7th gear ( out of 9 gears ) performs best.My seats are manual but still very comfortable.Plenty of cargo room - doing away with cage gives plenty of room in front cab for one person/extends leg room."
ram,promaster-window-van,2014,Mr Mental Mike Y, 04/01/2019,Incomparably the worst vehicle in its class!,1,"Say goodbye to your cash now!
If you are looking to purchase one of these vehicles I highly suggest, from experience, not to purchase the Ram Promaster 2500.
Why not? Because you want a vehicle that doesn't need to have its transmission replaced every hundred-thousand miles.
What? Yes. It has a mini-van trani in it and they are only rated for 100,000, that's it
I had mine done at 98,000
But that's not all. There are plenty of other issues, nearly to numerable to list.
Electronics shorts require it to be jump started frequently. The mechanics are unable to find these and down time has been costly.
The radio and rear cameras stopped working and were disconnected.
The transmission mounts went and now the van can make sharp right hand turns without you even turning the wheel!
It will drive you right off the road in moments should you blink too long.
It's rated at 20mpg but that's a lie. You are fortunate to get 15.
Continual problem with the rear door locking
Sounds like a freight train going down the road.
You cannot get parts for it!!!
I have been on a waiting list, and I am number 365 on the list, just for a transmission mount.
Brake caliper blew up. They are not sold at the local auto parts store, nor are they sold at Napa nor are they sold at Autozone, nor are they sold at Advanced Autoparts. You have to go online and search for them. Or, you could ask your dealer. I think that's what Ram wants, use their overpriced dealer garages to siphon even more money out of your wallet.
Let's review shall we:
Faulty breaks
Faulty electrical system
Full dashboard failures
Mini-van transmission that you are guaranteed to have to replace
Engine mounts that will need to be replaced
Hard to find, no, nearly impossible to find parts
Locking issues
Water comes in through the top of the windshield
I mean, these are not little issues. These are time intensive, costly issues.
Please, do not purchase this van. You will certainly regret it.
I was insulted one day when a fellow contractor said I had purchased one and he said that he had one at one time and that it was the biggest hunk of junk he had ever purchased. Now that I think about it he was most certainly %100 correct. I could have done better in a junk yard and saved myself all of that money.
If I can even sell it I doubt I will even get back the money I put into the repairs!

ram,dakota,2011,rdsteve23, 05/24/2015,Solid midsize light duty pickup truck,4,"I like my V6 crew cab 2WD BigHorn. It has decent power, handles good, rides smooth but has a firm suspension, and is comfortable. This is a nice light duty pickup, perfect for my family of 4, which can haul some light payloads and tow my camping trailer. I like the bold exterior look it gives, while the interior is comfortable and convenient. I've owned it for about 5 years now, and the only issues to come up was a faulty tire pressure sensor (still covered under warranty at the time) and every once and a while the gas gauge reads empty when I start it up, but then will slowly go to correct reading. All in all, this is a solid truck that didn't cost me an arm and a leg like most trucks do..."
ram,dakota,2011,engineer49, 03/31/2011,2011 Dakota 4x4 Ext Big Horn,2,"Fit and finish is very good, ride is comfortable, however, performance is sorely lacking.
MPG is 15, at best.
The transmission is reluctant to shift into the higher gears -- even letting off the accelerator doesn't encourage a shift change.
The 3.7L engine lacks the oomph to take on inclines without downshifting to 2nd gear.
The rolling resistance seems unusually high as it drives like it is towing or hauling a heavy load.
One would expect mediocre fuel economy to have a trade off in power, or vice-versa, but that's not the case.
Dodge would do well to re-outfit this truck with a better engine and transmission."

ram,dakota,2011,jason, 03/10/2018,Great Truck,5,"I love the truck but the only thing i would changes is I would have rather had the V8 and 4x4 other than that it is a great truck. I have traveled everywhere with this truck to PA,MI,NY,IN,KY,WV and it is very dependable and so far I have only had to take the truck in for regular maintenance.

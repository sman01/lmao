cadillac,ats-coupe,2015,Eddie T Theo, 06/02/2018,Love my ATS,5,"Previously owned two Cadillac CTS and put over 100,000 miles on both of them. After just a couple of months, I love my ATS Coupe - smaller size, performance, style, comfort, technology - it’s the complete package.

cadillac,ats-coupe,2015,JaNeen Hedquist, 10/24/2015,Beautiful inside and out,5,"Do not plan on ""great"" luxury service that should accompany this vehicle.....the dealership where I purchased this from actually chastised me for being 45 minutes late to drop off my car and pick up a loaner...treated me very poorly then the service and body shop guys did not want to speak with me, while I was always very nice to them.  Once the sales manager got involved and said I would go thru him directly, I said thanks but no thanks and went to a competing Cadillac dealership who treated me much better.  But GM service for luxury vehicles is still not up to par as their competitors are, such as Lexus.   Sadly, this will be my last GM vehicle and I will be going back to either Lexus or Audi.

cadillac,ats-coupe,2015,Etaganap, 05/20/2018,2015 Cadillac ATS COUPE premium 3.6,4,"Rate harsh. Possibly due to run flat tires. Difficulty not a ride I have expected from a luxury brand.

cadillac,ats-coupe,2015,Barbara Hudson , 09/17/2020,All The Sizzle—-ATS💥,5,"My all time favoritisms cars have been sports cars, from Triumps to Mazda RX7. The ATS is the very 1st 2 door coupe I found which gives the look & feel of a sports car , but doesn’t make the ‘mature’ lady driving it look silly! It is a vehicle filled with convenience plus all the safety features available. I’m more than disappointed Cadillac has stopped making them!!!"
cadillac,ats-coupe,2016,Walter Marsh, 05/29/2017,Great car except for two problems.,4,"This is a great car as far as acceleration and handling goes. Plus, in my opinion, it's a great looking car and has a reasonably comfortable interior. The back seat is  unsuitable for adult passengers but I didn't buy a coupe for four people to ride in. I do think the workmanship is very good. There are two major problems. I do not have the cue system and as I'm not much for high tech things, this is fine with me. However most controls are via a touch screen. Especially annoying are the controls for the heating/a.c. system. They should have added a few knobs instead of having to look over at the screen and touch the appropriate arrow. My biggest complaint, and you don't hear much about this, are the run flat tires which cause the ride, when hitting any type of bump, to be extremely harsh. I so disliked the run flats that I recently changed them out to non run flats and the ride is tremendously improved. Maybe I can only do 70 around that turn instead of 73 but that's okay with me. I put a repair kit in the trunk which includes a compressor and sealant and I also have Cadillac and AAA road side service so I am not overly concerned about a flat. Also, when you ride on a run flat with no air in it, you can than throw the tire away as the sidewall has been compromised. Oh, one other thing. The engine has the stop/start system but in 2016 there is a disable button which I engage every time I start the car. On the 2017's you cannot disable the stop/start feature. All in all, I like the car a lot but it took me getting rid of the run flats to say that.

cadillac,ats-coupe,2016,Ponco, 11/16/2017,"eye catching look, no more granpa cadillac",4,"I've own a coupe since the day I first purchased my vehicle.  Cadillac ATS coupe is a real upgrade for me from my beloved Honda Accord Coupe that has been discontinued from 2018 model.  The overall look is just great and I got so much compliment from my neighbors.  There some pros I'd like to state; a) there are not many around and I rarely see the same model that I drive (see sedans but not coupe), b) distinctive styling and ground crawling design, c) high quality material inside, d) CUE is not as bad as the critics have reviewed, e) great power from 2.0T engine, f) smooth 8AT shifting.  I must also mention some cons and they are; a) front seats do not recline fully, b) lane departure warning, blind spot warning, front collision alerts do not come with Lux model unless it is chosen.  My 2013 Honda Accord came with all of them as standard features, e) gas mileage is poor.  average is around 22, max. 33.  my 3.5L V6 accord coupe recorded max 36 highway, 27-28 normal, f) poor traction on OEM Continental run flat tires.  Got snowy day recently and the grip was poor.  I expected better and now am worried about coming snow season, g) it would be nice if the interior noise was suppressed since this is a luxury brand coupe.  Overall I am very happy with this vehicle.  It's exciting to drive.

cadillac,ats-coupe,2016,drewf, 04/24/2017,Underappreciated Coupe,4,"This was really a genuinely fun car to own and drive. I drove the 4 series and the C class, and this car performs very much on their level, if not exceeding them both in acceleration, handling, and ride comfort. It instills confidence. What it lacks is the level of luxury refinement of those vehicles, and others in this class. Cadillac has come a long way in developing this car. They just need to get the little details a little more refined, such as CUE, Nav, storage. But if you are looking for a real driver's car, and you can track one down with low miles, I say grab it!

cadillac,ats-coupe,2017,1st time Caddy Owner, 01/03/2019,Sporty but has the worst transmission!,3,"I love the look and road hugging performance. This vehicle's turbo 4cyl. is very fast. It can stand up to much bigger and more powerful engines. The 8A transmission is the most unreliable and hard shifting piece of junk I have owned. It makes all sorts of noises at idle, of which two dealers can't seem to repair. The 8A's hard and erratic shifting makes me regret purchasing this car. Countless futile trips to the dealer have added to my frustration. GM uses this transmission in several of its models, so these problems aren't exclusive to my ATS. GM please fix, I really like my car, just not the transmission.

Update: As of today, 7/11/2019,my car is back at the dealer and has been for over 3 weeks awaiting major repairs. GM/Cadillac has really spoiled my desire for every owning or recommending  another Cadillac!

cadillac,ats-coupe,2018,DONNIE SMITH, 01/05/2018,Limited selection,4,"Unable to find the ATS Coupe in the color combination I wanted so had to order, not will to pay for only part of what I wanted.  Being told it will take up to 2 months to get the car, which is see as odd since it is not a car in high demand. Also while shopping I found some cars had different options.  I view this as a likely failure on who ever input the information,  one that upon contacting the dealer had 6K dealer add ons, as I write this it is still listed on the interrnet at the lower price.  I will be happy to let you know my experence when and if the ordered ATS coupe get here.

cadillac,ats-coupe,2018,Mark, 11/25/2018,Surprised and Disappointed!,3,"Prefer to drive wife’s maxima for sure. Shocking how loud it is when driving down the road. Lack of cameras, and having to reach to dash for various functions is at least surprising. My bad for not test driving for a few days for sure. Folks think the car is sexy but regret the purchase.

cadillac,ats-v,2016,Tucker Maclain, 03/24/2016,Caddie makes a World-class sport sedan!,5,"This car can't be compared to a Camry or Accord, but rather a BMW M4 or Mercedes AMG C63 S.  When compared to those cars, they're all pretty even.  The Caddie has the nicest powerband with the twin-turbo.  The 8 speed automatic (GM 8L90) is borrowed from the 650hp Corvette Z-06, so in the application it's pretty bullet-proof and understressed.  It shifts every bit as quickly as Porsche's PDK.  It's a wonderful driver.  You really can't describe it, but rather you have to drive it to understand.  It feels as though it is on rails.  The interior quality is very high.  The Cadillac CUE has been updated and I don't mind it a bit.  It is a little slower to adjust fan speed or temp.  People have complained on the BMW fanboy site ""Bimmerpost"" that the instument panel looks out dated.  I think it's fine.  It has a totally cool, configurable HUD like an F-16 fighter that really makes the instrument panel unnecessary.  

All 3 of these top-notch sports sedans have their own personalities and whichever you pick will get you a winner.  What I liked about the Caddie was that performance-wise or, really any measure, it is the equal of Europe's best. The Caddie gives up NOTHING in performance, comfort, of technology.  Numerous outings from Willow Springs to the Nurburgring have shown it at least equal to BMW and Mercedes best.  The Caddie has touring/sport/ track modes that adjust damping/shiting and other parameters that make it excel as a daily driver.  The back seat is pretty cramped--seriously.  Not for adults.  I didn't buy it for the back seat though.  All that should go into my back seat is a piece of soft luggage.  The Caddie is 10s of thousands of dollars less than the other two and is arguable better.  And finally, you can feel good about driving an American car.  I NEVER thought I would own a GM car.  It's a new company though.  the 2016 ATS-V, Camaro, CTS-V, and Corvette Z-06 are all world class cars at bargain prices.  No longer is driving one a compromise.  They are among the best.  I am more impressed with this car every time I drive it.  That engine and and automatic transmission are absolutely stunning.  The chassis is very stiff.  The feature list is high.  It's an amazing vehicle.  Other cars I considered were the CTS-V, the Corvette Z-06 (way too cramped for me), the Jaguar F-Type R, and the Porsche 911.  I'm very happy with my choice.
"
cadillac,ats-v,2016,Brian Jared, 11/06/2017,Thoroughly Impressed!,5,"I bought this 2016 ATS-V Coupe used with 14K miles on it four months ago. I traded in a BMW 530i which I drove and loved for nine years. I have previously owned  2 Porsche 911's and a Porsche 944T (Yeah, I'm an older guy). I have only owned this vehicle a short time so I cannot speak to reliability issues other than to say the car had all the records and had been maintained by the dealership who sold it to me. Those records only indicate routine maintenance.                                                       I will start with the downsides. The backseat is for luggage, children, or an extremely crowded short trip for an adult. The car is essentially a two-seater, but that is what I bought it for. Getting in and out isn't the easiest, but it is a coupe. Compared to the Corvette and the Porsche Cayman S, it is much easier. I am not a fan of the touch-screen technology utilized throughout. I think it takes attention away from the road to a degree that buttons and dials do not. Also, the piano black color shows fingerprints quickly. I always carry a cloth to touch it up. And of course, when it comes to gas mileage, it is gonna cost you more. Those are the bad things. Lets talk about the good. PERFORMANCE! This thing is a rocket which handles so predictably, and gives you so many options as to how you want to set it up, that I just make excuses to get into it and drive. The Tour mode is remarkably comfortable for grocery store runs or cruising on the highway, but moving to Track Mode transforms the car. I really feel as if I get the best of both worlds. The Recaro chair upgrade is a must - I have never had a seat that was so supportive and yet flexible in how I want it to feel. As a driver's car, as opposed to a family car, this is an extremely comfortable and confident ride. It is both the fastest and best handling car I have ever owned. I chose it over a 2016 Corvette Z06, 2016 BMW M4, and 2014 Porsche Cayman S.  All were amazing cars, but the decision came down to comfort and cost. All four of the cars I drove were impressive, but the Caddy was just easier to get in and out of for this 66 yo. That probably isn't an issue for most. The cost also was a factor. It was between $7-14K cheaper than the other three with less mileage on it. But most of all, the ATS-V just blew me away with its performance. I did not ever think I would buy a Cadillac, but I did, and I could not be more thrilled. If it proves to be reliable, then I will hang on to it for quite a while.

Updated Review: 11/3/18 - 18 months with this car and I continue to look for excuses to drive it. I recently took a solo round-trip drive from Florida to Illinois and Wisconsin, putting 3400 miles on in 2 1/2 weeks - the car was a pleasure on the long haul. I have only done routine maintenance (all covered by warranty) and I have been more than pleased with the reliability of this higher-end performance car. I repeat what I said in the initial review about the piano-black touch screen being a pain, but if that is my biggest complaint about this vehicle, then I have little to gripe about. I highly recommend this car.

cadillac,ats-v,2016,ron stock, 01/08/2017,"Wow, you must test drive this car.",5,"This car equals the corvette with the 6,2  base engine; acceleration, steering, figure eight time, g-force, and braking. Every-else is a matter of personal opinion.  Most coupes and sedans  all have the same look trying to look like the modern re-design of the BMW 7 series. Cadillac dares to be different. I love it for being distinctive. It is real sleeper and real surprise to lesser cars who challenge you at a stoplight. The CUE computer management is much maligned as a way to find something wrong with the V series, I find the CUE easy to learn and use, not slow in any way. I read a review that criticized the automatic transmission. The V transmission is the same one in the corvette and is quite a thrill in race mode.

cadillac,ats-v,2016,Samual Dollar, 10/18/2018,Perfectly American - An Honest Review,1,"Update: While driving home one day on the freeway (at less than the speed limit), someone was merging into me and I changed lanes. The steering overcompensated and it caused an accident which damaged the rear bumper. The experience with the dealership and with Cadillac was horrendous. They quoted 6k for repairs and refused to give me a timeframe, it took over 4 months at a cost of over 19k until I got the car back, and they refused to check the steering system of the car or even write it down. Since I no longer feel confident in the safety of this vehicle, and since Cadillac made no real attempt to help, I cannot in good conscience recommend this car to anyone.  I contacted corporate who assigned a rep, she called the dealership, said the car was at a paint shop and she didn’t know which one, and closed the case. This was my second new V-series, and 6th new vehicle from GM. I recommend a brand that cares about their customers, which is clearly not Cadillac. /Update   
Cadillac has created something truly unique with the ATS-V series coupe, and I wanted to write this review to share my honest experiences with this car from the perspective of a person who works, goes to school, has a family, and uses it as his daily driver. To begin with I want to start with the tremendous value of this vehicle. If you look around you can find a great deal on a new or slightly used ATS-V, which instantly makes it within the grasp of a lot more people, making it a steal to buy one at the moment. Next I will briefly talk about performance. This car has more power than anyone would ever need for driving purposes, while having enough extra to have fun at the track if you do want to take it to the limits. I have the version with a manual 6 speed which is an amazing transmission, and really in normal driving you don't even need the 5th or 6th gear. 1st gear will take you you to 37MPH if you want to have fun, or you can shift sooner for when the family is in the car. With the rev matching (which can be easily turned on or off via paddle shifters) and in touring mode you can have a nice gentle ride, although my kids prefer when I'm in sport mode with the slightly more connected suspension. You can choose the level at which you are connected to the road and can adjust the electronic assists to your liking. I want to address comfort and interior quality. The seats are bolstered and very comfortable (I have the regular seats, the Recaro's are also nice, but are narrower and the interior finish is nice. A lot of reviewers seem to dislike the gauge cluster and the touch controls for the radio. To be honest, I have never had an issue with either of those. The gauge cluster has all of the information you need, and I never look at it except for fuel level since the HUD gives me all the information I really need for driving. I know there are some digital clusters out there that are fancy and can look nicer, but in reality when you are driving you should at least pretend to be looking at the road. As for the touch controls, the ATS-V has Android auto and Apple Carplay, and I have never actually touched the controls on the radio because I use the buttons that are integrated on the steering wheel and the touchscreen. I can see this as being annoying to some, and I agree that actual buttons would probably have been a better option, but it's not enough to justify not getting the car. I also like that the touchscreen is actually integrated into the dashboard rather than a random screen placed on it as if it were an afterthought like so many of the German's like to do. Other than that, the back seats are small, but great for kids (perfect family car, especially with an outlet in the back and 4g connectivity), there are a lot of compartments and storage space (including a compartment behind the stereo that also doubles as a charging mat), and the only real complaint I
 have with the interior is that the cupholders in the front are behind the shifter, and since I have the manual it can be slightly annoying if you actually decide to use them. With that said, I have a manual in a Cadillac, so I can't really complain too much. Finally, there is the exterior styling. This is obviously subjective, but I think that the front of the car is edgy and beautiful, while the back is more of a classic Cadillac conservative styling. The important thing to note is how few of these cars are around, I have had many people tell me how much they love the look of my car, and a big part of that is because you rarely see them. I have seen only 2 other V-Series coupes since I've had this car, and both were different colors (and one was driven by one of my law school professors who randomly switches between cars). The BMW M3 is a beautiful car, but they are a dime a dozen. I think this car looks nicer, plus with the relative rarity it gives it a nice edge since you see so few of them.

cadillac,ats-v,2016,JML, 12/20/2015,ATS Varoom.....,5,"I have owned several Corvettes... 4 BMW's... 2 of which were M's and the ATS V Coupe' is a superior machine in all aspects! Unfortunately the 2019 Coupe' is the final production of this machine! However it appears that a high end sports Coupe' is on the horizon... i.e. a mid-engine ultra luxury brother to the new C8 Corvette!

cadillac,ats-v,2016,Teeb, 07/11/2019,Shoulda got the 4 door,4,"Drive this car on the track, and you will forget the CUE system bugs, the impossibility of getting into the back set, the mediocre viability. This car, as one instructor told me, ""Is incredibly well ""planted"".  For 99% of the population (including myself) this car will always be a better car than the driver.  For everyday use, it doesn't shine as well.  The ride is harsh, even on tour setting, the carbon fiber effects are just asking to be crushed by parking lot bumpers and the gas mileage along with a smallish gas tank, yields a range of only a couple hundred miles.  But one shouldn't buy a V type expecting practicality.  Also, it gets a lot of attention.  Even at the last dealer I took it to, the service manager drooled over it - saying he had never seen one (6-Speed stick).  So I like it, a lot.  I forgive the short comings.

cadillac,ats-v,2016,Paul Berger, 08/13/2016,New ATS-V,1,"Great handling and pick up a little short on the electronics great seats no rear seat and small trunk but its a sleeper car and it moves out.
That was after one month biggest mistake I ever made there CUE flat out does not work period it has been in AutoNation of West Palm over three months trying to fix the electronics do your self a FAVOR reasearch the CUE systems for at least 4 years they have known about this issue and done nothing worst car I ever owned would never buy another Caddy.. I also own a ZO6/ZO7 not one issue with there infotainment center.  Do your self a favor buy anything else unless u want to live with out your car for months and spend your life at the dealership and shame on Edmunds for not reporting this issue I am currently seeking Lemon Law on this piece of crap they call a fine automobile serviced 4 times for the same issue total days without vehicle approximately 12 weeks total also left outside its was given back to me in horrible shape black spots in the pain will need to be clay bared etc.

[contact info removed]  GM Just bought car back thankfully i was not stuck with this car it is fast but Caddy has a long way to go before anyone should buy one of these just trying to save someone the headaches just google CUE issues they have known about this since 2013 but still sell the vehicles anyway., The cars
Handling was great better than my M3.. and very fast loved the recaro seats interior was cheap for a 75 plus car.. bought a Mercedes CTS with 2000 miles on it a 2016 that's a real machine with coil overs and RennTech tune 620HP and wow what a monster good luck be very careful of the. Caddys I now know why there service Dept was always so backed up .. Stsy away from Autonation at all costs worst customer service I have ever had.. they good learn a lot from Braman.. I hope this truly helps someone from making a huge mistake and spending all that time in service..

CUE system is wonderful once you learn to use it. I have a new BMW M2 Competition and in most situations I’d rather drive the Caddy. I’ve had zero problems with the car.

cadillac,ats-v,2016,Tjtiger83, 12/29/2019,A Classic Sports Car ahead of it's time,4,"Pros: There are definitely very few of these driving around compared to the competition in it's class (M3/M4, AMG 63s, Gulia Quad4, Lexus or the Infinity Q50/Q60s)
- if you like understated/sleeper status from people not in the know...this will check the box
- Vehicle doesn't disappoint in power and handling with a lot still left on the table by Cadillac (wait till you are out of warranty period to really unlock full potential of this beauty...can easily achieve 550hp from stock internals)
- very well planted chassis and unique aggressive styling and form
- Definitely passes the ""look back at it"" test

Cons: in between tires and Gas, you'll feel the hurt but no one buys this performance gem expecting the frugality of a Camry
- *CUE* Definitely the archilles heel of this platform because everything else was executed with precision. CUE definitely lacks in functionality in the class and definitely is the bane of user interaction. Implementation feels like an incomplete freshman software development project. There is no synergy between the user interface and all the good features provided by the platform. Definitely going to be a sore sport but this is like 10pt demerit on an otherwise 95% scale.
-Cadillac failed the car by pricing it out of the demographic it was trying to capture...yes it's supposed to elicit a ""luxury"" ethos but cadillac doesn't have the same cache as BMW and Mercedes with the M and AMG badges respectively. Thus pricing this car when the interior and infotainment trailed is competition was bad form and inevitable doomed this. I have one that is Silver with Grayish white interior and love it, but it took me over a year to have it come down to my price range. Dealers were more adamant of letting the cars go for their market rates by instead letting them sit on the lots gathering rust and getting outdated because of false sense of inflated values. Nonetheless, this is a lot of bang and car for the buck, compared to it's European and Asian counterparts. I prefer the unique lines of the coupe but if you need better space, definitely the sedan wins out, although you only get the split seats standard in the coupe but its an additional option in the sedan. Also the sedan sort of looks like the old 2nd gen CTS so there is that. Choose Manual if you care more about car fun and engagement vs 0-60 times reported on paper (auto better in a heavy traffic city nonetheless). You'll thank your inner gearhead/child for it down the line. Good luck finding a good specimen before more people wake up to this hidden gem.

cadillac,ats-v,2017,Scott, 06/26/2017,Don't own one quite yet,4,"The ATS-V made my short list after exhaustively examining the car and talking extensively with the Cadillac product people at the LA and San Diego auto shows the last two years.  I like what I've read in all the reviews.  Last Friday Cadillac invited people who had indicated a previous interest in the brand to a driving/instructional event at Qualcomm stadium in San Diego.  After learning more about the features of the models and driving several cars under controlled conditions the ATS-V is now firmly at the top of my list for another car in 2018.  Corvette, Porsche 718 Cayman, and Audi TTS are now tied for second.  In an orchestrated but still pedal-to-the-floor straight line acceleration run to about 80 mph 464 HP, and then Brembo brakes, just took my breath away.  The 8-speed auto (in sport mode) snaps off shifts easily as well as a Porsche PDK.  I drove a regular ATS in a short mini autocross, too, and liked how that model performed.  I've read the criticism of the instrument cluster.  That's just going to be personal for everyone; it doesn't bother me.  Supposedly Cadillac is working on a better CUE for 2018.  The ATS-V is a real sleeper compared to the Corvette as it's arguably nearly the same car.  The back seat, however, is something that everyone will agree on.  It's uninhabitable for anyone over about 12 years old.  I'm only  5'11"" and there's no way to fit back there.  Fortunately, there's only my wife and me so I don't require a 4-seat car anyway.  But if you do, please heed my warning.  I've been doing 4 track days a year with my current car for a number of years now with AudiClub SoCal.  If my checkbook does indeed jump out of my pocket in 2018 I think this Cadillac ATS-V will acquit itself admirably at Buttonwillow, Spring Mountain, and Willow Springs.  See you there.

This isnt your typical american-muscle, there is a reason ferrari bought MRC from GM. Who cares if CUE is horrible, just use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto...

Power comes on smooith and strong pushing you into the seat even under only partial turbo boost.  Standard seats are extremely comfortable.

Engine sounds great especially in sport mode. very quiet on the highway in touring mode.  Mine is wave metallic with dark wheels & red brembo brake calipers, also front grill and rear bumper trim is the optional black chrome.  its a shame its discontinued."
cadillac,ct6,2016,RON, 11/03/2016,"""HAPPY CAMPER FROM SPRINGFIELD, MO""",4,"I've been a loyal DTS/Deville customer for 30+ years.  Dealer tried to talk me into a XTS;  fortunately, I waited ""Patiently"" for the CT6.  Bought it early June,  8,000 miles ago.  Likes:  styling, quietness, handling, ride, acceleration, braking, cornering, fit and finish, seating, safety features and entry/exit.  Dislikes:  a/c continually ""Freezes up"" when operating continuously 40 min to an hour (blows ambient air).  Will reset after 20 min in off position.  Dealer attempting to resolve.  Instrument panel air vents won't allow air flow above the panel (directed too low).  Auto shifting not smooth (compared to '10 DTS).  Overall, best car I've owned, so far.  Highly recommend to friends. ………. 2 YEARS AND 48,000 MILES LATER:  A/C still freezes up, 90 degrees outside temp and high humidity, 5 trips to dealer, ""repaired"" again last month, can't test. Will not use for several cold weather months.  Transmission vibrates, acceleration and cruise. Back to dealer tomorrow.  Still like styling, ride, handling, braking, fit/finish and safety features.  Depreciation / resale value disappoints me.  No longer ""HAPPY CAMPER"" …….. 3.5 YEARS AND 66,000 MILES LATER:  A/C problem seems to be resolved after7 visits to dealer. Cadillac tech rep got involved.  Experiencing transmission vibration issues. May be resolved after 2 dealer visits. Still like the many positive features of the vehicle.  Very low trade in value disappoints me.

cadillac,ct6,2016,Robert J. Tarte, 08/29/2018,Terrible Service,1,"The electronics are terrible and Cadillac and GM customer service is terrible.  My vehicle,e has been at the dealer for 3 weeks.  2 parts have been replaced and the vehicle now cannot be programmed.  It took 12 days for a part to be shipped despite my request for overnight shipping.  Cadillac told me that they have their processes.  GM told me that they have their protocol.  Thus, 12 days to ship a defective part. My dealer told me that they are attempting to get authorization for a new vehicle but GM.  wants to send. Yet another part.  There is a question whether the part is even available,but GM protocol is the most important thing to GM,not a satisfied customer.  After 7 Cadillacs, there will not be a number 8.  It is a shame, because the CT 6 is a beautiful car.  GM has not changed since the bankruptcy and probably never will.  Do not buy a Cadillac.On Sept.4 after 27 days, vehicle finally fixed.  Hopefully, GM will offer some compensation for my inconvenience and time spent attempting to resolve the matter.

cadillac,ct6,2016,Mike, 08/13/2018,2016 CT6 Base Review,5,"CT6 Base with Driver Awareness and Convenience options including panoramic sunroof. I traded a 2011 Mercedes E350 and not having owned GM products for quite sometime, I am pleasantly surprised. Some immediate things I noticed.  1. When I first entered the car, it felt a little confined compared to the E350 but I'm getting used it.  There is plenty of room, just differences...  2. The turn signal stalk is high.  3. The rear is quite large; very roomy -  I am 6'4"" and my sons are quite tall as well.  the CT6 certainly fits the need as compared to my E class. 4. I'm a little surprised that the floor mats or logo.  Maybe they do on the luxury or premium trims, but not on my base.  5. The doorsill seems to scratch easily as compared to the doorsill on my E class. 6. I love the driver awareness features and all the tech the car offers. 7. There rear part of the sunroof shade can be operated from either passenger door in the rear - there doesn't appear to be a lock for it (as there is a rear window lock for example) so my children constantly play with it. 8. The rubber material on the key fob, well, is rubbing off.  I've read many prior complaints about this and will contact the dealer or Cadillac warranty.  9. The 4 cylinder engine seems to perform well although downshifts at low speed are very ""jerky"" and unappealing. Overall great car.

cadillac,ct6,2016,Snowbird, 12/28/2017,Guilted Into It,4,"I've had the car a little over a month now.  I needed it like I need a hole in the head (had a perfectly good 2006 Buick Lucerne CXL with the Northstar V8 that I still enjoyed but family was ""ragging"" on me to get a newer car that reflected my financial circumstances).  But now that I have it......... I actually sort of like it.  It was a brand new leftover 2016 (in Nov 2017) with 300 miles on it, and I got an appropriate deal on a two year old car from the dealership.  The performance of the TT 3.0 is not in dispute.  It went 0-84 uphill in the blink of an eye (seemed like it anyway) when my son drove it.........and it was incredibly stable and quiet when he did it.....and mine doesn't have the super-duper steering package.     Around town, it's quite smooth, but you notice the downshifting of the transmission sometimes (tight?). The dash/interior is beautifully done, but I think I'd prefer some of the ""old school"" practicalness....like airvents that close and can be directed almost anywhere.  The exterior styling is exceptional and I notice nuances every day that I missed initially.  People notice it...and I've caught quite a few just staring at it when it goes by them.  Trunk might be small but will be more than adequate 95% of the time.  I don't do electronics, but again, my 27 and 29 year old sons loved it all.  Too much for most folks, but comparing apples to apples, a darn good price vs Mercedes or BMW for the same capability.  Car cruises nicely and can be a very good executive commuter.  Back seat has lots of room for anybody but really designed for only two people.  The stop-start technology is irritating and I'm still looking for a permanent kill switch.  You can turn it off when you get in by pushing a button on the dash, but there should be a permanent kill switch too. As others have mentioned, storage pockets for all the little stuff are almost nonexistent in the front.  Over all though, not a bad package at all and worth looking at if you're in that price range.  Glad I made the plunge after the fact.

cadillac,ct6,2016,Big Wes, 11/13/2016,This Caddy Represents,5,"This is the best Cadillac ever IMO.  My first was a 1982 Cimarron (ok to laugh) then a 2007 STS, a 2010 SRX, a 2013 XTS and traded a 2014 XTS for this gem.  Car has styling, performance and handling.  Most noticeable is the ride quality over the XTS which was not bad but the CT6 gets a 10 out of 10 for ride quality.  It handles like a much smaller sports car yet it bathes you in luxury.  My only complaint is the lack of storage compartments for the driver.  The auto stop/start takes some getting use to but the on/off switch allows you to turn the system off if desired.  I looked at the 750 BMW and a S550 Mercedes before choosing to stay with the Cadillac CT6. The lack of performance and handling with earlier big Caddy's drove me to BMW for a spell. Now that they have addressed that concern I see them luring away BMW and Mercedes customers due to the attractive price point of the CT6.  Thanks GM for making Cadillac the ""Standard of the World Again""

cadillac,ct6,2016,Dana Basney, 04/19/2017,"Big, beautiful, quite, and safe",5,"I previously had a 2015 Cadillac . This car has so many more safety and technological features it is a generation apart. With 360 degree video recording, digital 180 degree rear view display it has far superior rear visibility than the traditional rear view mirror.  It has side sensing radar, front and rear sensors, automatic braking, collision avoidance warnings in the front, rear, and side, adaptive cruise control, pedestrian alert, heads up display with speed limit display and collision alert. Today I was backing out of my driveway when the rear side warning went off, allowing me to brake and avoid colliding with a teenager recklessly going 40 miles an hour down the street in a 25 mile zone.  Thank you Cadillac technology!  It's also a beautifully styled car, inside and out.  Only complaint is the front cup holders are too small and close together, and the storage space in the front console is rather limited.

I chose the CT6 Platinum AWD 3.0TT for the improvement in features, AWD for inclement weather, & larger interior.  It has every option imaginable & is an incredible everyday vehicle.  Now that I have been driving it for 2.5 years, can say without question it is the very best automobile I have ever driven.

cadillac,ct6,2016,Mike, 01/19/2017,Base CT6 Steering,3,"I like many things about my CT6.  My main objection is the whining from the steering column.  The columns were manufactured by two vendors.  Unfortunately, the base model steering column whines and the noise is annoying.  Had I known, prior  to leasing the CT6, I would have chosen a car from a higher model level with a quiet steering column.  I have been told by Cadillac, GM, and the dealer that the columns are not interchangeable.   The whining is very disappointing for such a well designed car.

Car has beautiful exterior styling. Ours is Passion Red with a silver metallic body pin stripe. A real eye turner. We get lot's of complements. It is the quietest car we have ever driven.

cadillac,ct6,2017,Jim, 09/18/2017,irritating whineing noise,4,"This is a very nice vehicle but it has a whining noise, especially between 30 and 40 miles per hour.  The dealer can't seem to find what is causing it.  If they can't soon find a fix, we are considering if the dealer will buy it back.

The dealer thinks the whine is coming from the rea drive shaft.  They have replaced the drive shaft three times, and the whine is beginning to start again.  Since this the third time they have been unable to fix the problem, GM said to replace the  vehicle.  It also falls into the lemon law.  I hope we can get them to give us a 2018 CT6.  By the way, GM says this vehicle is only the third one in the entire CT6 fleet to have this problem.   Lucky me I guess.

cadillac,ct6,2017,JK, 02/02/2018,This would be the perfect car but ...,3,"The 8 speed transmission on the CT6 is just plain awful.   The first to second shift feels at times as if you have been hit from behind by another car.  Other times it takes seconds for the car to shift from first to second and during that time the car has no power applied to the wheels.  GM and the dealerships appear to do nothing about this after several complaints and tell me its normal (no...it's not normal for a $70+ car to shift like a 30 year old truck).

cadillac,ct6,2017,m300michael, 11/14/2017,Fighting with GM is not easy,3,"I am having  issue that involves the transmission on this vehicle.  On occasion the transmission shifts/lurches so hard that it feels like the vehicle was struck from the rear.  I did take the vehicle in for service and dealership stated that they upgraded the computer and the problem should  not re-occur.  Wrong!  The same issue has occurred several more times and one time my grandkids were in the vehicle and it actually scared them when the vehicle lurched.  Reading other reviews involving the Cadillac CT6 shows that I am not alone with this issue.  I know that there is no perfect vehicle available on this planet but, what I fear is that the lurching may occur and cause an accident or  transmission will not last long and will need to be replaced (hopefully, while under warranty).
This transmission issue is still  an issue, as I have taken the vehicle back to the dealership and the dealership cannot ""duplicate"" the hard shift.  Interesting fact is that every single person that has been in my vehicle has felt this problem and I have had it occur before and after taking the vehicle for service.

No more review necessary.  GM repurchased this vehicle as of 11/15/2018 due to the issue with the transmission and their inability to either replace or repair it.

cadillac,ct6,2017,Paul, 11/08/2017,Easily the worst car I have ever owned,1,"My 2017 Cadillac CT-6 is bad beyond belief. It has been in the shop for approx 4 of the 20 weeks that I have owned it. I would not wish this car on my worst enemy. Here is a list of all the problems. Brake pedal assembly needed to be replaced, seat belt tightening motor needed to be replaced,  and panel under steering wheel fell off. Those are the problems that have been resolved. What has not been resolved is the headliner makes a loud rattling noise. It comes from the area between the sun roofs. I have taken it to two dealerships and they have attempted to fix it with “clamps”. That actually made it worse. Last but not least. The car makes a very loud whining noise. It sounds like a cat being tortured( not that I have heard a cat being tortured). It’s really loud. I understand that I may have just gotten a lemon but so far GM has not done anything to make this right. It’s a great looking car but so far miserable to drive.

Update: the car still has all the original problems and has added a new one. The brakes squeak intermittently. Not right away but after driving for a little while. This happens every time I drive more that 5 miles. It appears to be a known issue for the year and make of car. So I bring it in to dealership and apparently they drove it around the lot once and since the brakes didn’t squeak they said there was nothing they could do. What a joke. The car and the Auto Nation Cadillac dealership in Wpb Fl are horrible.

You have to experience the ride to see how smooth and how quiet the car is.  Handling, and acceleration are exceptional for a car this size.   Because the hybrids come fully equipped their is more high tech equipment on bored than I can describe . It was a pleasure to take on a cross country trip.  I say this car has a mind of it's own because at times when you need quick acceleration it will hesitate before going.

My new 2017 CT6 has the magnetic ride as well but with very little rubber between the road and the pretty 20"" wheels you feel the bumps like never before. I kept the 2007 for a few weeks and can't believe how much difference in the smoothness of the ride the 2007 has over the new 2017 and have to believe these low profile tires with large wheels must make up the difference. As for warranty, I am pretty upset that you do not cover these wheels since they come with the upgrade package. I have a strong feeling the first large chuckhole I encounter will damage the tire and wheel. NOT GOOD BUISNESS for such a great expensive vehicle. By the way, this is my 5th Caddy. I love everything else about it, but I always bought for the smooth ride and this may lose my confidence.

cadillac,ct6,2017,Cadillac Owner, 08/30/2017,Absolutely the worse Cadillac I've owned,2,"Buyer Beware. If you are committed to a CT6 insist that you road test your intended purchase for a few days before making the deal. First, I have owned 12  Cadillacs and was hoping that the CT6 was going to be the new flagship of the Cadillac fleet. It's not. . This disaster has the most crude, rough shifting 8 speed transmission that won't 'learn and adapt'  and gets confused about which gear to crunch into. My CT6 has build-quality issues as my car needed to have its entire front end reassembled because of a mis-aligned fender that got crunched by the front door. My CT6 experienced a catastrophic rear axle hub/bearing failure in its first 200 miles. If you don't have access to German smooth autobahn pavement, stay away from the 20"" wheels and magnetic suspension . . .  the car will shake apart on normal roads. The AC is weak and has issues with the thermostat's control of its fan speed. Cheap hard plastic interior with a poorly designed center console featuring a useless cell phone charger. The rave reviews on-line must be  based on quick test drives and photos of this otherwise nice looking sedan.

Update August 2019: This one ended up in salvage/auction with less then 5000 troubled miles on it. A real mess.  Fortunately, I can report that its replacement, a 2019 Cadillac CT6, is significantly better. GM upgraded the dreadful 8 speed transmission to a 10 speed and it actually shifts like any normal car. Nearly all of the options function and no glitches yet. Little tweaks here and there have improved it over the 2016-2018 versions of this model. It's a very nice looking sedan.

Update March 2020: Replacement vehicle, 2019 CT6 is  still performing well.

This is my fifth car.I have had BMW 5 series and Mercedes S series drivers ask me about the CT6 at gas stations and at work. The acceleration of the 3.0 twin turbo is beyond impressive and the fuel economy is reasonable considering it is a 400 HP car. I have only taken the car on one long road trip to Nashville. After four hours of driving i did not want the trip to end. The car is that much of a joy. It feels much lighter than the 4100 pounds that it is. It is pretty nimble for a car it's size. After one year i have not had any unscheduled maintenance.  The ride comfort is great and the rearview mirror that turns into a tv screen to show you the full rear view of the car is amazing! A must have on the highways.  I have no regrets and i highly recommend this car. It is great to see GM back on track with some great products.

Point is the car is gorgeous. But DAMMMMMMN ive never seen a ""Luxury Car"" who is so called trying to compete with the Lexus, Audi, BMW, and Mercedes!! this is by far THE CHEAPEST made vehicle i've even seen!!!!!  i have 8,800 miles on the CT^ and i'm hearing noises, squeaks, oh and when i go over a bump, it sounds like the damn bottom is going to fall out! similar to when i'm driving my grand dad;s 1970 Buick!.

cadillac,ct6,2017,Hugh Marron, 07/27/2017,Most Fun Car Ever,5,"If you have never owned a luxury sedan - give yourself a month to learn about the features , where they are and how to program them. I transferred from a Cadillac XTS to my CT 6 so my learning curve was much shorter but the surround vision was great, USB and Hot spot features take some getting used to, ONSTAR uses the built in Navigation system - you need to understand the interface features between Onstar and the onboard Navigation system - the one feature that is confusing is the memory setting from your remote key bob - they are not numbered anymore for some reason so you can confuse the memory setting for the seats and mirrors if you transfer remote keys - this is the one feature you should have the dealer explain before you drive your car away - it will save time later. Other than that - curl up with the instructions books and enjoy. After more than a year - I would add that the Premium Red car color is great as well - My car is outside 24/7 and looks clean all the time except during pollen season :)  Now 3 years in and I still love the car but will be replacing it with a 2020 Lexus LS 500 F Sport next week.

Low profile tires is the culprit. hit a curb, no tire scrape just grinding of the very expensive wheel. It happened with my 2013 XTS and the CT6 with same type of low tire will cause the same problem in addition to causing a bumpy ride. The smoooth Caddy ride generated a lofty reputation.

cadillac,ct6,2017,Todd, 10/26/2018,Easily the best car I have ever owned,5,"This is a very good handling car for how large it it.  I have owned many (mostly German) luxury and sport sedans, but this one it the only one that does everything well.  It is not the fanciest or most expensive I have owned, but the most well rounded.  Please note that I own the Platinum which has a lot of suspension upgrades that make a difference!  The braking is the best ever for a road car.  The 4 wheel steering makes the car seem very small when driving.  The suspension changes for every road condition and is VERY smooth and quiet.  This car is quieter than any Lexus I have owned and steers better than any BMW I have owned.  (Better feel than my M4 easily)  It is also serene.  No constant beeping at you like BMW.  My one complaint is that the transmission at low speeds has occasional mildly hard shifts which should probably not be an issue for this price range.

cadillac,ct6,2017,Geosur, 02/27/2017,Almost a great choice for top luxury sedan,4,"After test driving a few of the 2017 CT6 models, I have concluded this is not the perfect car for me at this time.  First of all, like many high end luxury vehicles, this car is air tight.  Therefore, when all the windows are up, it is difficult to get the doors to close without slamming them.  That's the reason why many of it's competitors went with automatic soft closures for the doors, like the trunk.  Next, a rear wheel drive is not available with the 3.6L engine.  Though I live in the snow belt next to one of the Great Lakes, I have never found the need for AWD as long as I use the right winter tires.  I love the way rear wheel handles.  I will never own FWD again, but would do an AWD as long as primary power comes from the rear.  And, I won't be sold on a turbo charged 4 cylinder engine forced to work hard to act like a 6 or an 8.  Besides, now you are stuck using premium fuel.  Next, I dislike steering wheel paddle shifter's and want to do my manual shifting on the stick in the center console.  And, I was hoping to be able to select something other than black for the dashboard and trim without having to move into the Platinum model.  What with the rear camera mirror?  It actually made me nauseous looking at it.  Otherwise, it is a very good looking vehicle and would most likely own one if it at least had the door closures.  I'm not going to slam doors on my vehicles.  I liked many of the features like heads up display, start/stop technology and brake hold.  With just a few more changes, I can see me behind a wheel of a CT6.

cadillac,ct6,2017,SH, 07/06/2019,Leaky Luxury,4,"I love this car!  It gets great on mileage, comfort and performance.  The only issue I have had, and it is annoying, When it rains, there is a very small leak between the dash and driver's door.  It has been in the shop four times and is now there for the fifth.  The service advisor has always been very friendly and never questioned taking the car in.  Right now, I am working with General Motors for their Buy Back Program.  It's sticker price of my car to sticker price of a new one, less a usage fee.  I'm sure the usage fee they will try and charge me will be huge, and I'll be very upset, we'll see.  If so, this will be my last GM Vehicle.
*** Update.  GM actually came through with a VERY surprising usage fee.  $400 for two years and 2 months of owning the car.  I now have a brand new CT6.  My only issue was that the selection of colors available to me was extremely limited due to having to select off my dealers lot.  My color choice was red but, ended up with white.

cadillac,ct6,2017,Kleslie, 11/11/2019,This car is made for driving!,5,"Anyone that has driven a full-size luxury car needs to drive this one. The only word that comes to mind is “nimble”. This car is bigger than it’s European competition, thousands cheaper than the competition, and nimble. AWD Is now something I can no longer live without, and that clunk people complain about is just the transmission engaging all the wheels, and if you’re not used to that it seems like somethings wrong. There ain’t nothing wrong, you just have to get used to flinging around Cadillac’s flagship. The V-6 is plenty powerful enough, and good on gas mileage.  This car is the same weight as my 2012 CTS was. Just keep one thing in mind when you drive this car, this is a big-Ass car!

I have had it in the shop four times and they always tell me there's nothing wrong with the air conditioner......and then they say that I need to have the windows ceramic coated.  Soooo, if it works correctly why would I need coating?  If it sits outside while I am visiting my family, it takes about 30 minutes to cool down, and usually it never cools down enough especially for people in the backseat.  I think I will go to Mercedes next as I never had a problem with that brand.  "
cadillac,ct6,2017,Tom, 10/13/2017,Not the old man's caddy,4,"I test drove the NA V6 with standard suspension and 19"" wheels.  Found it very composed, offering a nice ride on smaller bumps, as well as very solid high merging acceleration. Seats comfy during test drive, and CUE system worked fine for the limited amount I used it.  Felt the transmission shifted nicely and kicked down quickly for acceleration, though noted that the car was in sport setting.  Wife claimed she couldn't quite get comfy in the driver seat, though she didn't spend that much time adjusting it.  Overall, I though the chassis felt nicer than the E400 wagon i had just test driven, though not as fast.  The Merc was more luxurious inside, but I was not disappointed in the CT6.  Didn't get a chance to really lean on the car, but my test drive was enough to convince me that I should spend more time in one, and that it is still on the list of possible candidates.

The ride is so smooth it feels as though you are floating. The seats hug you as you drive and it feels as though they were made just to fit your body. The technology in this car is amazing and surprisingly easy to navigate.

cadillac,ct6,2018,Anguyen, 04/30/2018,2018 3.6 AWD,4,"I haven't experienced the jerky transmission shift problems at low speed. Perhaps because I also turn off the auto stop/start function which is unrefined (very similar to our 2016 Audi A6 3.0T).  The driving dynamics, technology and value have been as advertised. But fit and fitness needs work (loose rear quarter rubber seal, climate control panel popping out). At least my dealership experience has been excellent.   The car lacks the blistering speed of our 2016 Audi A6 but just as buttery smooth (perhaps slightly more than that A6). And the hushed cabin, technology and the way this large car handles a twisty road, on the standard steel suspension, are rather impressive.

cadillac,ct6,2018,Ken Deill, 10/12/2018,Perfect Purchase,5,"I have not been this excited about one of My Cadillacs since my first Northstar purchase in the late 1990s. I usually purchase used Cadillacs. I have had a 1976 Seville, 1997 SLS, 2000 STS, 2003 STS, 2007 STS AWD, 2013 XTS platinum. Most purchased three years old with low mileage. I now decided because of the Super Cruise feature to purchase New. I located the color, and model I wanted , drove 112 miles one way, and bought the White over Black CT6 platinum, I now own. I purchased it after a drive around the block. I traded my 2013 XTS platinum in, received 0% five year money, and drove home. 55 miles of which I went hands free, on super cruise. I have had Adaptive cruise for some time now, so I was used to everything, except letting go of the wheel. It was fantastic. The V-6 TT is right there as well. I have 1960s muscle cars that cannot beat it. I decided to drive the CT6 to my home in Louisiana 938 miles away from my usual residence. My wife, and I drove 600 miles the first day 85% of which was hands free. The whole round trip I drove hands free 1600 miles, Best 33 miles to a gallon, average 28. Through St louis in driving rain, and all. My wife said it beat every other Cadillac for front seat comfort. Finally the best massage in town on all four seats. I have peole at work that go out at lunch time just for that experience. The stereos have been so good for so long it is difficult to say, however the 34 speaker system , we love it as well. We both look very forward to the upcoming V-8 , I will opt for the 500 horse unit as I like the looks of that vehicle better. Thanks Cadillac for another great experience every time I decide to take this car. Did I forget to mention , It is fun again to take an automobile trip. Fun to drive 80 miles or so for dinner. Thanks Again. Ken Deill

cadillac,ct6,2018,Tony Da'Acosta, 07/07/2018,Best Full Size Luxury For the Money!,5,"After hearing and reading all the stuff people where saying about the CT6 I decided to buy one. It wasn't easy since a lot of reviews where complaining about ""vibrations felt on steering during acceleration"" to ""Suspension not being smooth enough all kinds of stuff, after finally getting one I can say most of those reviews where just hatting on the CT6. There is some vibration felt under extreme acceleration but to anyone that has owned an AWD vehicle if you say you have never felt this you are lying they all do it, before getting this CT6 I had a S550 AWD same feeling when picking up speed under hard acceleration, some reviews compared it to the junk Audi A6, had one of those junks too always at dealer for problems with vibrations, electrical stuff battery use to drain, trim on doors and pillars coming off, nav screen stopped working  and weird noises from AWD system under hard accelerations and or turning at low speeds, after just 16mo. of ownership decided to take it to the nearest carmax and get rid of it, not to mention the trade value on the A6 was less than 45% after 16 mo. : (.. The Benz was a lot better than Audi very smooth and not as much vibration, the only problem was the electronic suspension other than that great car. I test drove the Lexus and I can't believe why people make such a big deal about that car, the LS 500 felt like driving a Ford Econoline felt very heavy and not mannered at all during lane changes, lots of tire noise at highway speeds and seats are not comfortable at all they are very hard rear are a little better but still for the price tag there is no comparing. Some websites say ""the CT6 competition Offers more technology and options"" well thats a lie, none of the ones I mentioned above had any of the options the Premium Luxury CT6 offers and even if you get the top of the line Lexus, Audi or Mercedes you still don't get the same technology you get with the CT6, Panaray Bose, Active Chassis and steering, wifi , night vision and not to mention Supercruise the best. There are a few flaws to the CT6 1. Engine should have more HP, even though it gets up and going very well . 2. Transmission on AWD model shifts hard at low speeds sometimes, not all the time but I do have a lead foot. 3.  Start / Stop Technology is annoying I think Luxury cars shouldn't have this period or at least a setting where you can turn it off period never to come on again at next ignition cycle. Other than that there is nothing at the time that bothers me, fits all the stuff I have to carry for my 3 kids , car is very safe all of the safety and driver awareness stuff works great, Heads up display is great you see all the warnings there , auto parking feature is cool and works perfect, love the night vision and the 360 cameras record any disturbance to the car and records you trips. Great Car Overall and so far it's been great, Getting an average of 29.9 MPG but I mostly do highway.

cadillac,ct6,2018,Bill Fisher, 09/14/2018,After One Month - The Good The Bad and The Ugly,3,"My previous 4 cars have been in order Volkswagen Phaeton and a 2011 Hyundai Genesis, a 2013 Hyundai Genesis and a 2015 Hyundai Genesis.  I have been driving my 3,6L Luxury Cadillac CT6 for 2,000 miles so far.  My first driving impression is that for a large car, it drives much smaller.  The steering is very precise and the car is definitely a point and shoot driver.  To me that is a HUGE win.  When cruising down the road it is quiet and silky.  It's definitely the most serene car I've owned in my 65 years up until about 70 MPH.  I think at higher speeds the Genesis G80 is quieter.  This is my first Cadillac though because I've always despised floaty boat like drivers and that's how I always remember them.  This is most definitely not that.  Color me surprised.  I actually test drove it when it was suggested by my favorite sales guy who moved from the Hyundai store to a Cadillac store.  I fully intended on buying a Genesis G80 Sport and was waiting for one to arrive in a color I liked.  (it never did)  Hyundai needs to fix that.  It lost a sale over the fact that a vehicle in anything other than gray or black  was never available.  But when I drove the Cadillac I fell in love with the ride.  My hot buttons are Safety, Quiet and Handling.  I will not stand for a car that wallows.  The Cadillac checked all the boxes.  I have had this, as I said, for one month and now comes the ugly.  The car has been to the dealer more in one month than my three Genesis' combined did over 8 years.  The initial quality problems, while not big issues shouldn't happen and I will list them.  1.) The console cover once fell right off in my hands when opening it.  It  was replaced under warranty.  The fact is, it is the smallest center console I ever saw besides.  It's almost a joke.  Not a deal killer for sure but all the same.   2.) The right front wheel had a big gouge in it.  It was replaced but I had to go back to the dealer a 2nd time because the air pressure monitor stopped working in that wheel after replacing it.   3.) When the car goes into 4 cylinder mode there is a vibration that seems like either the timing is off a little or their is a torque converter shudder.  It is almost imperceptible.  But I feel it.  On the plus side, it doesn't go into 4 cylinder mode often.  I find it hard to believe that Cadillac engineers designed it to drive that rough in 4 cylinder mode.  My dealer doesn't feel its out of spec.   4.) The drivers seat is squeaking.  It normally doesn't start until I have a few miles in and the car is warmer but it is getting increasingly bad.  If I bounce my butt up and down I can make it sound like a cheap motel bed.  When driving it is apparent when I hit a bump or corner.  This just bugs the crap out of me and I am going to end up getting it fixed or shoot the car.  I also think the dealer prep was lazy.  I had to have them work on both my windshield and side view mirrors because of some kind of residue that made my windshield look sandblasted and the side view mirrors smudged and dirty looking.  I tried resolving these myself with window cleaner and scrubbing to no avail.  I don't know what they used but it's mostly OK now.  I will say, once these issues are taken care of I will absolutely LOVE the car.  But these niggling issues should not exist on a $65,000 car.  That said, I love the drive, the quiet and the value.  Would I buy it again?  At this price point you aren't going to get another car that offers the quiet, size, the comfort and the safety, combined with the precision steering on anything like this.  In short, if I don't buy a Genesis G80 Sport, my next option would be this.  For reference, I test drove Acura, Audi (I own an A5 Cabriolet) Volvo, Genesis G80 Sport, Kia Stinger (wife vetoed that one) Buick Regal Wagon and Honda Accord.  The Genesis does fall a little short on the Interior materials compared to the
 Cadillac.  But the Genesis has a better infotainment system and real knobs for the radio and A/C controls.   I'll call it a toss-up at this point.  But if the Genesis had just a bit better interior it would have won out.  UPDATE:  More time has passed and I think it's time to say it like it is, I'm sorry I made the purchase.  Very sorry.   Here's my beef with this car.  Any time it goes into 4 cylinder mode it virtually rumbles.  HORRIBLE!  The dealer says it's normal.  I call BS.  Second, and I'm sure they will fix it.  Or at least I hope they will, the drivers seat squeaks worse and worse the longer I own it.  How in the heck do they validate seats that squeak like these do?  The infotainment system needs tweaking.  The lack of buttons means there are always, and I mean always, going to be fingerprints all over that big beautiful 10 inch screen.  Now these things may seem small to you, but when you are the owner and driving it, they matter.  Especially the seats and the rumble.  I'm sorry I made this purchase.  I regret it.  I should have bought a Genesis G80 Sport.

cadillac,ct6,2018,BRM, 11/21/2020,Self Driving Super Cruise and 4 Wheel Steering,5,"This car has exceeded expectations in every way. There are a number of cars on the road that have some of the options...but not many in this price range are all available on one car. 

1. Super Cruise option = Self Driving - hands-free on divided highways...many roads have been added...it is no longer limited to just roads with on-ramps or off-ramps. Nearly every divided highway in our area is now in the system. I recently took a 1,200 mile trip and probably didn't have my hands on the steering wheel more than 45 minutes at the most....maybe just 30 minutes....just amazing! A camera monitors your eyes...so you still have to watch the road. This option is only available on the Premium Luxury or the Platinum models...and runs about 5,000 to 6,000 more...so worth it if you plan on taking long trips. I am in my 60's and it took me all of 5 minutes to become comfortable with using this option. In some ways, it helps one stay more aware and is able adjust for traffic issues more quickly than most humans. 

2. 4-Wheel Steering...how many people even know that this available on a Cadillac. This makes the car extremely nimble...easy to transition from lane to lane on the interstate with precision...better on turns and easier to park...you have to experience it to believe appreciate it.

3. Night Vision...this enables the car to see out beyond your headlights. You can even display the night vision on the dash and you can see what the car is seeing. This enables the vehicle to detect a person crossing the street before you seen them...or other such obstacle...it will warn you and assist with braking if needed.

Lastly, you add other options that many cars have such as the panoramic sunroof, sunshades for the rear passengers, multi-zone climate, massage seats, incredible sound system, self parking for every type of parking space, lane assist, dual rear view mirror...works as a true mirror or operates using a rear facing camera, all wheel drive (in addition to the 4 wheel steering that turns all 4 wheels) and more. 

When you combine that with a quiet/smooth ride in car that handles like a sports car...just an amazing car. One has to wonder why it was not promoted more?

cadillac,ct6,2018,NormV, 11/25/2020,Cadillac that delivers seamless torque/ride qualit,5,"The 2018 Cadillac CT6 plug-in with 40 miles of battery range and full tank of gas will exceed +500 miles or more than any current EV car. On battery 80-100 mpge is the norm and on longer drives 35 mpg at highway speeds and 40 mpg when the 2.0T engine is fired up in the city. The battery will get me to work to charge there and home with errands and eating out with ease as we have seen over 1,500 miles without gasoline engine firing up. The CT6 wheel base is long so most road irregularities are taken with ease. Though rougher surface steets do transmit through the ridge aluminum and steel chassis. The seat area is comfortable and wide with good thigh support for longer legs. The heated and vented seats can be programmed for everytine the car is started. Though tech features like rear view camera is mostly used in congested setting with limited distance viewing like a regular rear view mirror, the night vision works wonders in highlighting sidewalk walkers while deer silhouettes are highlighted with a flashing display and vibrating seat given plenty of time to slow. The night vision works wonders in thr fog that the human eye cannot see. This 2018 was purchased new in March 2020 for about half off the listed price as nothing could match it technology for the middle $30's price.

cadillac,ct6,2019,Cmaygar, 08/18/2019,"Style, Class, Value",5,"I recently purchased my CT6 Sport after shopping for a month or so for a twin-turbo sport sedan. There was nothing within striking distance of the price of my car to be in the running. The technology packages on my car, with the added comfort and technology package, are outstanding. My favorite new piece of technology is the rear view mirror full-spectrum camera. Wow! This is the best safety feature since the blind-spot monitor. I never turn the camera back to its normal setting. 

This car handles beautifully. It’s acceleration in “touring” mode is smooth and amazingly quick. The car corners very well, which is amazing for its length. The entertainment and utility system is very easy to use and quite intuitive. I also love the built-in phone charger. Great idea! 

This is definitely not your grandfather’s Caddy. This Sport edition is a true head-turner. The aggressive body styling is very sharp.

But once the vehicle arrived (yesterday), all that was forgotten.  The vehicle itself is a full five-star production in every detail.  
The engine is incredibly strong.  A gorgeous exhaust tone is trumpeted with anything above a mild acceleration.   The ten speed transmission is almost unnoticable.  Shifts crisply without any lurch or delay.
The body is a beauty from every angle.  Wheels are also striking.
Interior leather is very high quality.  Seats fully adjustable.  
While I miss some high quality woodwork, I understand that this is a Sport model so the panels that would have otherwise been wood are carbon fiber.  
The dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use.  The icons of the various systems are all good size and easy to spot.  The electronic dashboard is configurable so the info each driver desires can be displayed.  
In the final analysis, the vehicle was even better than I had hoped.  So glad I waited the nine months from the order/reservation to delivery.

For 10 years old, it still looks great and in style, however it has had its share of problems. I have had to replace the rear O2 sensor. The camshaft and crankshaft position sensors on the engine also both went bad, which made the car stall randomly after running for a while. It was also leaking fluid onto the exhaust manifold which caused a bad burning smell when the heat was on, which was an expensive fix. Handles OK in the winter, but I wasn't able to make it up a snow covered hill. Great car but it's showing its age under the hood."

I have driven this car almost daily for 14 years and 5 months before upgrading to a new vehicle, this week. This vehicle never gave me any problems, nor did it give me any major repairs or anything of that sort. Even today, I can get in this vehicle and drive it to and from work without any hiccups. I drove this car over 250K miles, and aside from normal wear and tear, regular fluid changes and few cosmetic blemishes this car was awesome.

Past winter problems with heat coming in on one side and not the other. Was in shop 7 weeks in 2 months time and still not fixed. Continuous computer problems with Heat digital knobs on dash. Engine leaked oil had it towed 3 x after $4,000 out of pocket expense from the engine gaskets busted etc.If you do not drive much probably ok to have for a while I average over 20,000 miles a year or more due to my job not recommended unless you have money to spend on costly repairs.

cadillac,cts,2003,originalsoul31, 03/13/2013,"I miss my Pontiac Grand Prix, which as a better built car.",2,"For 10 years, my dream car was the CTS. My Pontiac Grand Prix GT suffered a blown head gasket. Sold it for $600 and used the money as a down payment for the '03 CTS. Test drove it, loved it. The same day I left the car lot, problems arose. The oil pressure light came on, but that turned out to be a wet sensor. The next week, the check engine light comes on, it's a bad gas cap, fixed that after a few weeks of troubleshooting. Last week it shuts down on the freeway suddenly. Two months in and I still cant trust this car. Hopefully once I can get it right, I'll love it. But right now, it's making my '99 Grand Prix and '84 Toyota Tercel seem like better built cars."
cadillac,cts,2003,D Kuriger, 12/08/2016,Money Sucking Vortex,2,"I bought this car used from a dealer and within a couple of weeks sunk over $2000 when the transmission cooler exploded. This was a problem because the cooler is located inside the radiator and the antifreeze mixed with the transmission fluid and the transmission had to be cleaned out. Then the right front shock assembly broke. A simple, common part with only $50 labor. Except GM has stopped making parts for this car already. The mechanic couldn't believe it. I finally found the part from a junkyard on the other side of the country. Then another part broke and again, the part could not be found, so my mechanic made something that would work. It is now sitting on my driveway, the transmission finally gave out on it. I haven't listed all of the problems I've had with the car (heater doesn't work after 6 months, leaks every fluid like a sieve, warning lights randomly come on and then turn off, sometimes the window controls don't operate the right window, and on and on). This was a fun car to drive when everything works, but that only adds up to a few days in the last year.  I'll never own another Cadillac.

UPDATE: After the car sat, non-running in my driveway for a few weeks, I ended up selling it to a guy for $175 and feel like I got the best of the deal.

I had betrayed  Toyota, specially the Camry (the best by far). I loved the WoW factor, even 5 yrs later people still comment about the design of the car. Even the commercial was a blast, the one where luxury cars were wasping around and the cts came into the ballroom and stole the spot light.  5 yrs later at 80,000+ miles, my CTS is showing its age. I have take excellent care. I have not missed one scheduled maintenance but the window motor went out, air compressor must be replaced and there was another $1000.00 job that I cannot recall. "

Problem areas are A pillar size which obstructs side vision and rear vision is limited by rear end height and rear seat headrests.

The CTS handles like a dream and the brakes are topnotch."
cadillac,cts,2003,Steve, 12/30/2006,Safe Used Car,5,"When looking for a used car for our daughter, we selected a used CTS. Our feeling that it is the best buy for the money. It provides more value than anything new in our budget.  It gets 27 mpg on the road.  The CTS has a very solid ride, great brakes, and it delivers outstanding performance in sport mode that rivals anything on the road today. We are tall and the higher roof line is important. The trunk is OK, but another couple inches in length here would be better."

I owned this car for 3 years and it never went longer than 3 months without needing a repair of some sort. Don't make the same mistake I did. This car's beauty comes at a painful cost.

cadillac,cts,2003,meeshi, 04/17/2012,Ehhh,3,My parents bought this car when it first came out. and now 10 years later its mine. Im a senior in high school. From what i remember it had a lot of issues and still does. The a/c and heat haven't worked for almost a year. The engine has this weird low idle sensor that needs to be replaced. I would say that if you bought this car to get a real good warranty for it! The check engine light has been on since we got it! and so has the check air bag light.

some heads as you drive by. The after 
market spoiler adds another dimension 
to the vehicle. Car has enough power, 
but could use a few more ponies. The 
comfort of the interior is accentuated 
with the 8 speaker Bose system and 
navigation package. This car rides like 
a dream with stabilitrack. The minimum

cadillac,cts,2003,AtlantaSpeeder, 07/13/2017,This Car Is POSSESSED!,2,"The best thing about this car is the interior. Sitting inside the car is like relaxing on a very nice couch. And couch is a good term for the Cadillac CTS because that's pretty much what it is--a piece of furniture, because its hardly ever moving. Why? Because its constantly breaking down. The motor in this thing seems to have a shelf life of about 150,000 miles. I've owned this car 5 years and have spent THOUSANDS on various, regular repairs. And the ECM repair issue (GOOGLE it) is an epidemic. Literally, every one of these models has a defective ECM. The longer you own the car, the harder it is to replace the ECM, and thus costs to repair are SOARING. last time I checked, an ECM replacement at the dealer cost around $1000. Cadillac is a joke, and this car is a punchline. DO NOT BUY THIS HEAP!! And forget about getting support from Cadillac because those people are incompetent and could care less. Buy a Lexus instead! Get your money's worth and drive something that is reliable!

cadillac,cts,2003,ms.tree, 11/29/2008,Worst car ever,3,Without a doubt the worst car I have ever owned. This car has been down more than up. I bought it certified used and a extended warranty and I've still come out of my pocket with a couple thousand. I took the car to 5 different Cadillac dealerships before the 5th figured out it was a stearing sensor. I once took it in got 2 blocks from the dealership and it had to be towed back. There have been so many problems I can't remember them all and now the seals have to be replaced the timing belt and cam covers all this at a cost to me around $1800 unbeleiveable. 
cadillac,cts,2003,Mark, 03/12/2009,Like throwing $ away,3,"I can not begin to say how disappointed I am with this car.  As soon as the warranty expired it has cost nothing but money and time.  My average annual repair bill in in excess of $3000 and the average repair takes 3 to 4 days to get corrected due to misdiagnostics by the shop technicians.  This on a car with less than 100,000 miles on the odometer.  I completely understand why GMC is on the verge of bankruptcy.  And my forgiveness to those who will lose their jobs when they finally close the doors, but if you build junk and offer bad service you don't deserve to be in business.  My experinece with this car has been so bad I will never buy another vehicle from the Big 3.  Ever!"

Dismissed it at first, because I never saw myself as a Cadillac owner.  From looking over many other vehicles, I bought the Cadillac. Biggest misconception is people think its an 8- cyl., which GM needs to highlight. Fuel efficiency could be better, but it IS a 'sports' car, nothing like the whip your grandpa drove. One minor repair in seven months, but I got a good deal and an ext. warranty in a bad economy. The dark red looks sharp and I'm happy.

After several test drives especially with hearing challenged mechanic a new differential was installed with no luck. The noise sounds like a cross between a worn bearing or a strong wind across some metal vanes. It gets progressively loud when the outside winds are anywhere from 15 to 20 MPH or my vehicle speed reaches 60 mph and above. It's unbearable when ever I take a trip on the road.

Other than that, I am very pleased with this car, has held up well, trani & motor are still super tight and handles very well.

cadillac,cts,2003,newcaddycts, 07/22/2002,'03 CTS vs. '02 530,5,"I compared 6 cars in & around the 
same price range. The 2 that stood out 
were the 530 and the CTS. Both are 
close in size, options & performance. 
Both share some of the same parts 
(transmission & seats) & good build 
quality.  The largest difference 
between the 2 cars, besides styling, is 
the price.  The BMW is $11,000 more 
than the CTS with comparable options, & 
in my opinion almost identical in 
handling. This makes the price 
difference too hard to overcome for BMW.

If the CTS is not one of top ""editor's 
choices"" for 2003 then the fix is in.  
Read both reviews & drive both. You 
might find the short comings listed for 
the CTS a bit petty afterwards."

Interior is comfortable - nice but not

light cover fell off every time I 
opened the roof at freeway speeds, Then 
the clock decided to lose time, the

cadillac,cts,2003,Casey, 06/10/2009,"Lots of Miles, Lots of Fun",4,"I am surprised to read so many reviews with people having problems with their CTS'.  I have put over 100k miles since purchasing mine used almost 4 years ago.  It now has 155,000+ miles on it and I am just now having to replace the fuel pump.  Other than that, no significant problems.  My 03 still looks great and gets plenty of compliments.   "
cadillac,cts,2003,cdiez, 06/06/2002,bmw beware,5,"a much better combination of 
performance/comfort than bmw can 
offer. (Ive driven the entire bmw 
line, this car matches great against 
5s and 3s and I currently own an X-5) 
The bose sound system and electronics 
pkg is far superior to that of my bmw. 
Climate control is also far superior 
to my BMW. Perfect size...BMW 3 series 
are just too cramped inside. This car 
gives nothing away in handling to any 
bmw sedan except for the M3. Styling 
is exceptional...get great comments 
from onlookers everyday. BMW's sedans 
look like hondas at 50 yards."
cadillac,cts,2003,L. Hodge, 07/01/2009,Foolishness,2,"I purchased the pre-owned car in March 2006 with around 16,000-22,000 miles on it.  The first few years were ok, except I had to purchased tires the next year!(gross), anyway, I have had problems after problems after problems!  Now, for the fourth time on today I had to get a tow truck to tow it into the dealer in Greenbelt, MD.  I need a timing belt, which will cost 1,500.  It's has been the worst car besides the Volvo I had long time ago, that I have ever driven!  No more cadillacs for me!  thank god.  Never will I purchase a cadillac again!  No way, hosay!!  No more cars, period!!  Dissatisfied to death!! (Mad, angry, frustrated, whatever!!"
cadillac,cts,2003,Noah Hill, 07/06/2009,The Best of The Best,4,"I purchased this vehicle used. It was a very high mileage, but I got a steal. It has over 200k, runs like a dream. The CTS combines the luxury of a Benz with the handling and power of a BMW. "
cadillac,cts,2003,CTSdriver, 06/11/2002,If this is just the beginning....,4,"The CTS is the first car 
heralding Cadillac's new direction. It 
is great looking, I've got compliments 
from people young and. It's feels fast, 
and it is, although it could use a 
little more power. It corners with a 
lot of confidence for a large car. The 
comfort is alright, but the Volvo that 
it replaced seemed to be easier to get 
into, it is also not quite up to par 
with its stablemates (STS and DTS, 
which I have driven) which are very 
plush. The interior is much maligned 
for its plastic looks and I must agree, 
although the actual material is much 
nicer than regular interior plastic. It 
has a very nice feel that you must see 
and feel for yourself."

the 2nd automobile I have ever owned.  
My first was a 90 Mazda pickup that I 
bought brand new.  After almost 12 
years I was ready for a change.  And oh 
man, have I changed.  This car does 
wonders for your self confidence and 
ego.
I actually can't wait to wake up in the 
morning now to drive to work.  I have 
trouble sleeping.  I've woken up at 
night and sat in the driveway to play 
with my personalization settings the 
other night. Today I left for work 
early and drove around some more after 
arriving.  Luckily my company will be 
relocating soon.  It should add another 
10-15 minutes to my commute."

cadillac,cts,2003,taedog77, 10/18/2009,Ready to burn!!,3,I bought this certified pre-own (34K miles)car as a lease turn in and have been regreting it ever since.After 50k miles the car fell apart I've spent over $6k in repairs on this piece of junk and it only has 110k miles on it and it is currently broke down now. The brake lines in the rear rusted out with a repair cost of $1100.The oil pump started leaking at 75k miles. Take my advice STAY AWAY from Cadillac they will screw you in the end and to top it off they issue no recalls for this car at all and they know it has major issues! I REALLY HATE THIS CAR it like a bad marriage and I want OUT!!!
cadillac,cts,2003,Big Jay, 10/29/2009,very happy,4,This car has been excellent. I bought the car use and the performance has been exciting.  I do not have any negative issues to report the car is great.
cadillac,cts,2003,blue max, 12/05/2009,Blue/Silver,4,Car purchased with 9000 miles It was not titled until I purchased it Exec.car. We put over 14000 miles a year car now has 81000 on it. G.M replaced 3 of 4 Good Year tires and didn't help much. Put 4 Bridgestone Pole positions and the car went like it was on rails. Wonderful This car has the Sport Suspension on it ant the wife and I love the way it handles and rides. We drive it hard on long trips and regularly get near 28 miles per gallon.Large trunk with amazing space. Navigation system is not user friendly but gives you lots of other features related to the car. We found a great 2009 CTS and will pick it up in a couple of days. Would have liked to keep it in the family

cadillac,cts,2003,roxnter, 03/09/2010,Bad engineering,2,"I have never liked this car, but my wife loves it.  Excessive engine noise, makes it sound faster than it is.  Very stiff suspension.  Fine on curvy roads, but very annoying in town.  You feel every bump.  Cheap interior and tinny sound when doors close.  Just normal repairs until recently when alternator belt failed, chunks of which got under the timing belt throwing off the timing and ruining the engine (bent valves, heads to machine shop & unknown damage to pistons.  What kind of cheap engineering allows the timing belt to be dislodged by a alternator belt failure.  Should just run out of juice & stop.  I was afraid this Caddy was going to do this some day. Last GM product I'll ever own."
cadillac,cts,2003,mr.flowers, 03/17/2010,Costly repairs!,3,"I puchased my cts just feb. 17, 2010 from a pretty reliable sounding private dealership. Exactly 1 week later the engine light came on. I bought the car with a warranty so the diagnoses was it need a THERMOSTAT and a WATER (something). $748. That night the light came back on. took it back, left, light came back on. This time the sensors need to be reset. same thing happened. after 4 times with this back and fourth in 2 weeks, I'm next gonna try a back yard mechanic since the dealership can't fix it! Go figure"
cadillac,cts,2003,c_rey4, 03/21/2010,Frustrating Problems,3,"I purchased this car used with 38k miles and a clean CARFAX report.  I was very happy with the vehicle until I hit the 58k mile mark.  My check engine light came on at this point and I discovered my thermostat quit working.  After doing some research online, I found this is an overwhelmingly common issue.  Before I got the car in to be repaired, the engine started making a terrible ""wobble"" noise.  All of the bearings went bad on the front of the engine.  I decided to replace the thermostat, tensioner pulley, and water pump myself.  5k miles later and my thermostat is bad again.  My AC compressor seized at 70k miles as I was driving on the highway.  $2k in repairs this year alone and I did the work..."
cadillac,cts,2003,Caddy owner, 04/05/2010,Nice Car,4,I purchased used and only had to replace the battery in about two years.  Very reliable car and very easy to conduct routine maintenance.  I am not a mechanic yet it took me about an hour to replace all brakes and routers.   Fast car and handles great.  Nothing to complain about.
cadillac,cts,2003,Tom Cat, 06/24/2002,You've Gotta Love This Car,5,"I ordered in April 2001. My CTS arrived
in May (4 weeks from the day I ordered
it). What an awesome car. I absolutely
love it.  I haven't seen any others on
the road since I got mine. So I get a
lot of attention from other drivers,
pedestrians, etc. A lot of ""thumbs up""."
cadillac,cts,2003,kstaff22, 05/07/2010,pleased,4,Bought 2003 with lux package-17' wheels for my wife in Jan 2003.We liked the ride and handling and have taken it a couple trips to FLA.Had a few issues which I expected since it was the 1st year of a  new model. After a couple months their was an issue with the steering rack that cadillac replaced--after that no problems.There was a recall on the Goodyears that they replaced at 25k--- and a rim that pitted that they replaced---so I didn't have to spring for new tires till almost 60K miles! Live outside of Buffalo NY---handles well in the snow. Looking forward to getting a new CTS-4 next year after I get my moneys worth out of these new tires.
cadillac,cts,2003,reggaebooba420, 06/01/2010,Great If Garage Kept,5,"Depending on where you live can play a huge role in the yearly damage on your car, rain, humidity, extreme heat and cold weather are all happening factors. I keep mine in the garage and never miss an inspection or oil change. With only 37,000 miles, 6,100 yearly average, my Cadillac provides luxury and comfort for swinging and banging on the streets of Houston."
cadillac,cts,2003,dtb2, 07/19/2010,Fun CTS,4,"We had this CTS since the month of December in the year of 2007 and this car still drives like new. The only problem on the car is that something is rattling under the hood whenever we take off fast or if the car is in park, but we love this car, and this car is so nice that i'll pass it down to my son for his first car. We love CTS and I recommend it to anybody who likes them."

cadillac,cts,2003,Dewsweeper, 07/13/2002,What a Nice Car This CTS Is,4,"We have had our new CTS for two weeks.  
This CTS is the lux/sport package with 
sunroof, auto, heated seats (won't use 
this much in the ""Big Easy""), HID, and 
white diamond paint.  

It really sticks to the road and is a 
hoot to drive, but the enthusiasts will 
want another 50 HP. The standard audio 
system is fine.  

Rear seat passengers have more leg room 
than you think, but headroom is 
slightly cramped for the six footer.

The dealership was very price conscious 
and sold us the car for $300 over 
invoice found on the Edmund's site.  On 
top of this, I was able to apply 
another $1000 off using my GM card 
earnings.  Sweet."

Today I stopped for groceries, while pulling into the parking lot my tranny line broke off the radiator. will cost $950.00 to repair, lines were rusted out.  Now I see were there is a RECALL on the brakes lines?  what about the other lines?"
cadillac,cts,2003,jeffE , 07/16/2002,Love my orphan,4,"I love my CTS.  Great handlng, could 
use more power.  The manual 5 speed is 
great, definetly not my grandpop's 
Caddy.  My only regret is that I spent 
32K on the car and next year it is 
going to have a restyled interior, 
bigger V6, and an optional V8.  Kinda 
kills the resale value of mine.  I 
only wish GM could have sorted some 
ofthesethings out for the first model 
year."
cadillac,cts,2003,AutoMole, 07/29/2002,'03 CTS,4,This car has dramatic styling and looks different from all the other 'McSedans' on the road.  It also has incredible handling and braking with decent performance for a V6 (although the engine could use more torque IMO).  The paint and overall fit and finish seem to be of high quality.  It's an all-around fun car to drive that never fails to put a smile on my face whether I'm looking at it in the driveway or behind the wheel.

My parents both have their own 
Escalades but i have to admit that 
having a car is so much more fun and 
enjoyable.  It has a better ride.  The 
CTS has more than enough room and has a 
very good ride.  It gets lots of looks 
and stares and many people are jelous 
of it.  I am glad I got this Cadillac 
and i dont think I would trade it for 
anything."
cadillac,cts,2003,R W Becker, 08/10/2002,??,4,"Difficult to master the electronics.  Navigation system absolutely requires the 
instruction manual and is still difficult.  OnStar cellular telephone service 
doesn't make sense at $ 1.00 per minute and a separate telephone number. 
  The OnStart 30 minute demo time had nothing that worked correctly.
Rear visability is very poor.  Automatic Speed control buttons at the bottom 
of the steering wheel are not convienent."

some good stuff here! If they keep this 
up, I'll never go back to BMW."
cadillac,cts,2003,cigar_surfer, 08/20/2002,Cadillac's first true sports sedan,4,"Cadillac did their homework and nailed the essential qualities required to 
compete in this class, then went the extra mile and strode into uncharted 
territory of bold yet elegant styling. In keeping with the sport sedan credo, I 
opted for a 5 speed stick and lux sport. The car drives beautifully and 
handles like it's crazy glued to the road. You'll feel each undulation of 
pavement, but that's the way it should be. If you want to float down the road, 
try a DeVille. The ride is not harsh, and is 
very quiet. Engine is smooth, quiet and responsive. I feel the interior evokes 
just the right blend of luxury, ultra modern styling, and purposefull utility."
cadillac,cts,2003,jefferdmann, 08/21/2002,My Lemon CTS,3,"I loved my car at first but between 
2000 and 6000 miles it has been in the 
shop 6 times, the last three for a 
coolant leak.  Cadillac has refused to 
replace my car insisting that they can 
repair the cracked head.  I have 
retained a lemon law attorney who 
assures me I have a very strong case. 
Bob Lutz seemed to be making a 
difference with GM and especially 
Cadillac, unfortunately their quality 
problems appear to me to be reminisent 
of the 80's.  I am so disapointed.  I 
just turned 40,and I bought my first 
cadillac.  Next time I will go with 
the BMW or Lexus."
cadillac,cts,2003,pdrjr, 08/22/2002,Lovin my CTS,4,"When I was a kid Cadillacs were cool.  
By the time I was in college, they were 
living rooms on wheels.  Now, Caddy is 
making a car that kicks butt, turns 
heads and competes with luxury 
imports.  I'm an American.  I want 
power, performance and bold styling.  
And I want to buy it from an American 
company, especially at a time when 
world opinion is decidedly anti US.  
The kids at the car wash tell me they 
love my CTS.  People stop in parking 
lots to look it over, and slow down in 
traffic to get a better view.  Break 
Through indeed."

cadillac,cts,2003,Dr. M.A. Sharpe, 08/27/2002,CTS ! What a fun car to drive!!! Wow !,4,"This is definately not your grandpa's 
Caddy!  This is the most fun car I've 
yet to own.  I got all the goodies, 
but with the 5 speed.  Great choice!  
Much better feeling of control than 
the Lexus 3-series, BMW 5-series, and 
Mercedes 2-series, all of which I've 
had. This is the first Cadillac I've 
owned, and I promise I'll be back for 
more.  Very impressive, great design, 
nice sport/luxury feel.  TURNS HEADS 
EVERYWHERE !!  Only complaint is foot 
parking brake, instead of a hand 
brake.  Too many moves to get brake on 
and in 1st or reverse to park.  GM 
should fire the guy who designed that, 
but everybody else gets a 50% raise, 
and a company car..."
cadillac,cts,2003,BARBARA M. JOHNSON, 08/31/2002,THE ULTIMATE CAR,5,"This is a truly beautiful vehicle. 
Great design appeal.I am amazed by the 
numerous comments that I receive from 
fellow drivers and walkers-nods of 
approval, thumbs up and requests for me 
to describe the car's features. The 
ride is smooth and it handles well. 
What a great choice for a 70 year old 
adventurer. Cadillac has a winner in 
the CTS."
cadillac,cts,2003,calicadi, 09/02/2002,Change is good,5,"It was the exterior styling that 
snagged me. Read everything I could 
find on it for almost a year. Finally 
took a test drive and was sold. The 
size, balance and weight are properly 
handled by the engine, transmission and 
suspension. The interior is comfortable 
and functional, stylish without 
gimmickery. Fit and finish are 
excellent. Driving it is a real hoot. 
You can cruise around in regular auto 
mode or punch in the sport mode and get 
aggressive. It is hi-tech, so reading 
the owner's manual is a must, but the 
payoff is getting the most out of the 
experience. After checking out the 
German and Japanese offerings, and the 
Lincoln LS, I chose Cadillac."

cadillac,cts,2003,Dr Mike, 09/26/2002,"Eat your hearts out Euro trash, Caddies",4,"The fact that GM is actually using the 
transmissions that they supply too BMW 
is amazing in itself. This car is up 
there with the Lexus GS300, BMW 530i, 
Mercedes E320 at a price $11,000 to 
18,000 dollars cheaper. Preformance and 
size are identicle, this is a no 
brainer. However if you have money you 
would rather throw away than donate to 
worthy cause, instead of a dealer."
cadillac,cts,2003,Alan51462, 09/28/2002,Safety Hazard,3,"The design of the CTS windshield and
dashboard creates serious reflections
that can blind a driver, as happened to
me, when the conditions are right.  The
dashboard is highly reflective and only
a moderate amount of sunlight seriously
reduces visability.  I test drove the
car on a cloudy day.  Today was sunny, I
got blinded and asked the dealer to
rescind the transaction.  

Another problem, the ride.  When I went
over a public street that was suffering
from a washboard effect, I bounced so
high that I would have hit the ceiling
if I hadn't been properly strapped in.

AVOID THIS CAR AT ALL COSTS."

I go.  The navigtion system has already

I can go over the speed limit if not

She drives wonderfully. She has the

Volovo S80.  For the money, you would 
be hard pressed to find a better deal. 
When I bought the car my wife was out 
of town in California with friends. 
When she returned she unlocked the car 
with her remote and the pre-sets,

recommend a CTS to anyone who loves to

driving.  Cadillac has gone all out to 
provide a perfect blend of styling and 
performance using quality craftmanship 
and technology.  I was more than a bit 
apprehensive about buying a new vehicle

we put more miles on it.  We bought the

would ever buy a car without one."
cadillac,cts,2003,firemedic24, 10/03/2002,THANKYOU Cadillac!!!,5,"Unbelievable - that about sums up the 
CTS.  I test drove hoards of vehicles, 
and even though the CTS may not be the 
top dog yet, Cadillac defintely did 
their homework!!!  I love absolutely 
everything about the car.  It may only 
have ""220 HP"", but with the combination 
of the Lux Sport package and its 
handling capabilities, I didn't even 
notice what car reviews are calling 
ashortfall in the Engine!"

YOU , YOU FIND A CAR ON THE MARKET THAT IS THIS FUN TO DRIVE

cadillac,cts,2003,ry1nik, 10/02/2002,CTS,5,"I've never had an ""entry level luxury 
car"" before, so I can only compare my 
CTS to a Grand Prix or lower type 
vehicle. I have the feeling that the 
CTS is strapped to me, instead of me 
just being an occupant of the vehicle. 
That indicates how much I like the 
driving quality. I got the Copper 
Sunburst color (which Caddy is 
discontinuing), and I get LOTS of 
comments and turned heads."

blue CTS.Car looks and drives great. 
Getting alot of complements everywhere 
I go.I actually enjoy my drive to work

S60, FELL IN LOVE WITH THE NEW LOOK,"
cadillac,cts,2003,MGD, 12/05/2002,Sexy Beast,5,"I did a lot of research before I bought 
this car. I test drove several cars, I 
went to the car show and considered 
every car under 45,000. In the end the 
CTS was the car that really stood out 
from the rest. My wife told me that if 
I were going to buy a car in that range 
I should get one that looked like it 
was. I got one with every option except 
the navigation system. It's garnet red 
and it's about as sexy as a car can be. 
I love driving it, looking at it, 
playing with all the toys and showing 
it off."
cadillac,cts,2003,sad Cts, 12/08/2002,Should have waited another year,2,"This car has been nothing but trouble. 
Its first defect was on the trip home 
from the dealer. The stabilty systems 
yaw sensor went right away.

Next the sunroof, the A/C system leaked 
into the cabin and flooded the floors. 
The seat tracks rusted, the wires got 
wet, the oil cooler leaked coolant. 17 
days total out of service so far and 
there are more problems, too many to 
list!"

exterior styling that is unique, not a 
run of the mill generic jelly bean.  
Now if only my CTS had some horse 
power!  It is really lacking in that 
department.  The V6 just doesn't have 
the power you would expect.  A real 
disappointment.  I'm not happy with 
the ""early"" shift pattern of the auto

CTS.  We drove the base as well as 
fully loaded Luxury Sport edition.  
Within 45 minutes of arriving at the

edition.  It is a head turner and we 
are really happy with the decision to 
go with the CTS.  Full of power, great

have people of all ages making compliments, many at stoplights are 
questioning cost. A few with BMW's & MB's are checking it out while

replace a comperable size Mercedes. 
There is simply no comparison, the CTS 
is more comfortable, provides greater 
performance, has great eye appeal and 
all without sending you to the poor 
house. We purchased the sport luxury

lots of power and comfort.  I would 
suggest that you ask for tinted 
windows when you purchase it.  I 
didn't think about it as I purchased 
the car when it was dark.  The car 
handles the road beautifully and hugs 
the curves like a car should."
cadillac,cts,2003,ClevelandDan, 01/22/2003,The time of your life!,4,"I've had my CTS for about a month and 
bought it after test driving the BMW 3 
and 5 series several times.  Long time 
Honda owner, but had to look at 
American cars after seeing so many look 
alikes from the Japanese & Germans.  
Tough to tell an Audi from a BMW from a 
Toyota.

The CTS is a blast to drive - almost 
seems like it is reading your mind when 
you want to change lanes.  Once you 
begin moving over you better be ready - 
the CTS is very responsive.

Can easily cruise at 80 mph and you 
don't even notice.  I defintely use my 
radar detector at all times.

Great turning radius as well, very 
tight and quick."

cadillac,cts,2003,Minoz, 02/02/2003,Too bad for BMW and MB,4,"32 year old, happy with the CTS.  
Wanted the BMW 5 series, or a Benz, but 
neither were budging. The interior of 
the CTS is similar if not better then 
the BMW, for less money!  Ride and 
handling is fantastic, both sporty and 
luxury.We get looks everywhere we go. I 
love the fact there is no chrome, or 
cheap pieces to fade on the exterior.  
I can't wait to tint the windows.  
Highly recommend the vehicle, even 
though, I love the fact that there 
aren't too many out there, like the 
BMW, which you see at least ten a day!
And if you don't mind the driving a 
Cadi Soprano's(we're in NJ) jokes, you 
won't be dissappointed."

the corners very well.  In comparison 
to the Benz Kromer the Cady beats it 
hands down.  The performance is awsume.
Its not a very roomy Car.  But it is 
very sporty and handles like a VET.
  I use to have an Escalade, and this 
car out performs it.  So giving up the

price of the manual CTS in base form.  
There is more image here for the 
dollars.  Add to this the fact that the 
car is fun, on rails, fast, cruises at 
110 with ease, and garners looks 
wherever you go, and there's little on 
the downside.  Compared to an Acura, 
Lexis, BMW, etc., I was able to buy my 
teenage daughter a Hyundai with the 
savings."

not trade it for anything. got the 5

comfortable seats and excellent engine 
power at any speed. only two things to 
modify: the glove box is too small, and 
the car revs too high at highway speeds 
in 5th gear: either add a 6th gear, or 
change the 5th speed gear to get better

of the car right.  The handling is 
great with the luxury sport package, 
the build quality is as good as any 
car I've owned (the Caddy is #39).  
The car is tight and quiet around

on the free snacks.  "

this is the direction they are going 
then maybe we have something we 
Americans can be proud of other than 
just the Corvette.  If Cadillac is 
looking to attract younger buyers 
they've succeeded with this car.  I 
have no complaints so far.  The analog 
clock in the dash is unnecessary, would 
have liked more guages instead.  Other 
than that, I just push the sport mode

The CTS has handled great but am 
discovering some mechanical problems 
with it after owning it for a year.  It 
is now in the shop for 5 days for water 
intrusion into the interior of the auto 
from the a/c system.  The passenger 
side set frame is rusted from the water 
damage and the carpet needs to be 
replaced.  This is not something I 
consider a minor glitch and hopefully 
is in isolated manufacturing problems 
with the a/c system.  I would consider 
a 2004 CTS but would not recommend a 
2003 CTS."

test ride, it took only a short spin 
to realize that this was a different 
Cadillac. It not only looks great, but 
it drives like a sports car, handles 
really well, and gives good mileage in 
the bargain. It has most of the luxury 
features that I look for, and I have 
had only one problem with it; the 
plastic cover on the head lining that 
holds the controls for the courtesy 
lights and the sun roof is faulty; and 
it is continuing to be a problem;

I really can't complain about anything, other than the fact that the plastic caps on the wheel lugs fell off (dealer/warranty fixed).  Other than this I have not experienced any mechanical problems in 20,000 miles. For those who want an American car, this is a serious competitor for the German imports."
cadillac,cts,2003,Top Cat, 10/01/2003,CTS is a great ride,5,"For us true Americans we are hard 
pressed to find a review site that 
hasn't sold out to the Japanese or  
Germans.  So, after a PILE of research, 
I gave the CTS a go...and I will likely 
never come back.  Taking turns at 45 
MPH causes the stability control to 
kick in, but the car sticks the turn.  
Acceleration is excellent and the 
access to controls allows you never to 
take your eyes off the road.  Most of 
the controls are voice activated so 
using your hands is optional anyway.  
It is a very steady and stable ride and 
response is phenominal.  I am proud to 
be an American car owner and am 
extremely happy that this no longer 
means settling for a lesser ride."

passengers. Washboard surfaces can 
shake teeth loose and no on has ever 
ridden in this car with me who has not 
complained that they feel car sick 
from all the jittering and bouncing 
they take from the ride. If you have a

It definitely needs some more power.  
The power is adequate but not exciting. 
Cadillac has hit a good nerve with the 
younger buyer.  I have experienced zero

been perfect.  The volume wheel on the 
steering wheel is poorly positioned as 
I hit it when turning on occasions 
blasting the volume.  The car is fun to

chance.  Overall I would recommend this 
car to anyone. "

and was excited.  I thought that 
cadillac had finnally made a break 
Through.  I experienced nothing but 
problems.  Air conditioner leaks 
flooded the car twice.  All the carpet 
had to be replaced. Battery went out.  
Warning lights coming on for no 
reason.  And the service from the 
dealership was horrible.  I called the 
Customer Assistance center thinking 
that they would help.  Not only no help 
but rude.  Cadillac will never regain 
market share with poor quality and even 
poorer service.  They just don't seem 
to care about the consumer once they 
have purchased a car. Beware of the CTS 
unless you want migrane headaches"

driving such a car.

The suspension is firm but not punishing and it handles great. It's not super fast but it does move when you step on the gas.  I have owned the car for more than a year and the only problem was an overactive stability control system. I drove to the dealership and they fixed immediately in less than 30 minutes.  I do a lot of driving and so far it has been totally reliable. It even did pretty well in the snow.  I have gotten a lot of compliments on this car.

not get in our driveway when there was 
more than a half of an inch of snow.
We also were involved in an accident on

It also warned me that there was no oil

cadillac,cts,2004,Mike, 08/28/2015,Heavey maintenance car with many pattern problems,4,"When this car gets over 75,000 miles there is a 50 percent chance that the headgaskets will fail and need replacement. 741 coce on the transmission, that is an intermittent or stuck off position of the shift selnoid in the transmission. $ 20.00 part $ 2000 dollar job. 171 and 174 codes . 174 most likely will be an intack leak after the throttle body. You will need to get a gasket set and replace the throttle body coupler as well. Cheap but labor intensive. You have to remove the plenum for the gaskets first taking off the Fuel rail etc etc. When you do this you will see were your starter is located. After 100,000 miles or 150, stretching it you will have to replace the double plat plugs. Front is ok to to do , the back by the firewall could be a pain in the butt. While your at it change the coils if you could afford it. You may start to develop oil leaks . Many of the O rings around the sensors dry up and start to leak slightly. The oil filter adapter leaks on these cars, usually needing a new gasket or possible new adapter and gasket. While u have that off, u might as well change the crankshaft sensors located in a tough spot right above the oil filter adapter using new o rings to stop those little oil leaks that are starting at this mileage. Also changing the crankshaft position sensors will assure you that they wont fail and leave you stranded without notice. Piece of mind. The cars are just heavey maintenance. im a mechanic that changes the oil regualrly using good sythetic oil and filter. I use my caddy, but it could be a pain in the u know what. the parts are made realy light of aluminum and these days they are not even madein the states. Many now are made in asian countries and many mechanics will tell you they are having problems with the quality and reliability of the electronic sensors etc. Even a/c delco is stamped made in China etc. Timkin Hub bearings are now made in Korea. Not bad but the old american made lasted longer. Just be ware what is going on in this industry. Be cafeful. It's not just Cadillac it's all of them. Make them cheap and  light and sell them for high profit. Be well everyone good luck. Write to Gm in Detroit and tell them to make their cars here parts here putting American men and women back to work.

Here 9 years later and about 180,000 miles she is still running strong and fun as hell to drive. I remember when I first test drove it I was in disbelief it was a caddy.

Well, I can not be more happy. I have let friends with BMWs and other cars drive it and all you have to do is look at thier faces after they get out of the car. They know what I now know.

Put a new set on about 12k ago and they won't last until next inspection April '12.

If sliding (from a stop at slow acceleration) on slightly wet pavement is is fun, it's fun. I've driven in Illinois winters for sixteen years; this is the only car I've ever slid off the road in. Interior looks good for awhile, but black finish on control buttons has chipped off. Interior lights dim off and on, and the cruise control has been disengaging--it only has 18,000 miles on the car. To this date, it has had three recalls. Don't waste money on a tired name when there are car quality companies producing luxury vehicles built with the driver in mind."

I have been frustrated with several recalls and other parts that wore out, like the starter.  I have also had defective memory seating that is supposed to remember your previous setting.  That had to be replaced.  I did not find the dealership to be attentive to my service requests and had to make several trips for the same complaint to be repaired.   The back seat is tight in leg room and should definitely be larger. I traded in a BMW 740iLl to buy this car and will be going back to another BMW.

I also had this problem, not because of a faulty wiring system like many of the reviews said, but because of the bose sound system. When i bought the car i knew bose made a cheap product and expected this to happen, due to the lack of a remote wire on their amp.  I replaced the amp and speakers (the bose speakers are made of cardboard) with a better product and it fixed the issue. This car has great handling and plenty of power.  "

I have the 3.6 L engine and acceleration is great and handling is also quite sharp, not to mention the turning radius on the car is one of the best out there.  This car is super smooth at fast highway speeds and is a good looking car.  When you compare it to other European cars in its class, this is hands down the best bang for the buck. This sure isn't just an old man's Cadillac.  I'm in college and I love it.  This is proof that Americans can make superb quality cars.  The newer generation models look 10 times as amazing.  The CTS is definitely the greatest American car on the market today."

I have the Luxury Sport package with the 255 HP engine, Bose sound system, and the 17 inch wheels.  This is a very practical and comfortable family car and gets excellent gas mileage.  My only issues with this car is the door height from the inside (I always have to open the door when I am at the drive-up ATM) the fact that the car can easily be accidentally shifted into neutral from drive if my passenger crosses legs or shifts and bumps the shifter, and that the blower for the climate controls is VERY loud. A loaner CTS I recently drove with fewer options was not as enjoyable.  Get upgrades on this car."

hesitation when you press on the gas

suspension and cabin upgrade was a 
good addition. Stabilitrac keeps the

The cabin is very comfortable. The 
exterior is built to very tight 
tolerances.
I looked at the Acura TL, Infiniti

simply more fun."
cadillac,cts,2004,Glenda Stayton, 01/03/2006,CTS is a cool car,4,"The Cadillac CTS with both the luxury and sport packages is a very cool and fun car to drive.  You have more quick acceleration than you need and with the addition of chrome wheels and a spoiler...you have the looks.

I drive from Prescott, Arizona to both Southern and Northern California often. I have enjoyed separate drives to: the Canadian Rockies, Branson MO, Durango and Salida CO, Washington, D.C., Roswell NM, and Tombstone, AZ.

My CTS was in the same price range but in another class when it comes to performance. The mileage was the biggest surprise. I get between 28 mpg to 31 mpg on the road.  Where we live we have a lot of twisty two lanes road that we have to use, a real pain except when I use the CTS. So far I really love this car. "
cadillac,cts,2004,george, 08/06/2007,"After 3 years, CTS great car",5,"2004 CTS was purchased new. After 3 years, has been a great car. Love the OnStar, mileage, looks. No problems. After my '85 Caddy disaster, thought I would never buy another Caddy. Just bought a new STS last week.  Most reviews are after a few weeks of ownership. After 3 years with the CTS, I bought the STS and my wife still drives the CTS. That speaks volumes."
cadillac,cts,2004,Z28west, 08/02/2010,Sporty Nightmare,3,"It's very fun to drive, and fast for a V6. Looks great and turns heads. Great interior. However it gets terrible mileage for a V6. I get 24 on highway if I'm lucky. It burns about a quart every 1000 miles!  It is worthless in snow and ice. My transmission went out at 95,000 miles. $5000 for a new one installed at the dealership.  When I step on my brakes the car shimmies and shakes back and forth. Had to replace a brake caliper at 75,000 miles $850! Basically it's a unreliable gas/oil burning expensive piece of crap that I can only use half of the year if the transmission wasn't broken! Spare yourself a headache and steer clear! Its looks ARE deceiving! "
cadillac,cts,2004,rcwilbur, 07/09/2008,Timing Chain Repair at 70K miles=$2500,3,"I love driving this car.  When purchasing I opted for the 3.6 liter engine, in part, because it has timing chains that are supposed to survive the life of the car, as opposed to the 3.2 which the owner's manual suggests replacing at 100k miles.  The owners manual even states that if you don't replace the timing belt on the 3.2 liter you risk severe engine damage.  Well the timing chain broke on my 3.6 CTS at 70K miles and the dealership estimates that the repair costs will be about $2500.  Dealership also told me they had another 3.6 CTS in at the same time, for the same problem."
cadillac,cts,2004,ceranic, 01/04/2006,Do Not Purchase This Vehicle,3,"Think twice before purchasing a 2004 Cadillac CTS. Due the fact that front and rear tire sizes vary, it is not possible to rotate the tires. Consequently, the tires will feather (cup) and produce an irritating, noisey ride.  According to several tire dealers, plan on replacing tires after approximately 15,000 miles. I would seriously question any rave reviews on the fun aspect of driving this vehicle, or any vehicle, whose tires remain in place without proper periodic rotation."
cadillac,cts,2004,Truegrit, 09/27/2003,Cadillac CTS with 3.6 liter engine,5,"This is the best car I have ever owned; 
the drive and handling is suberb, the 
engine is peppy with ample horsepower 
to carry the weight and accelerate as 
needed.  On a dollar-for-quality and 
performance basis, I don't think 
there's a Euro luxury sports sedan that 
can begin to compare with the CTS."
cadillac,cts,2004,Debbie North, 08/25/2004,Personal use,5,"I love the exterior styling.  The 
vehicle still draws the attention of 
other people.  Engine performance is 
outstanding.  Plenty of power when 
needed.  Easy to drive, easy to park.  
Good room for both front and backseat 
passengers.  Interior styling is very 
attactive.  "
cadillac,cts,2004,bill e, 12/20/2005,Drives like it looks,5,"The 2004 Cadillac CTS is a blast to drive. Its turning radius and power gives you a sense of dominance. It seems to turn heads with its short but big reputation. The big brother V doesn't hurt. One hundred thirty MPH is the fastest I've gone, but want to go One hundred forty five. For the price it gives you speed, dynamic handling, some luxury, and a lot of fun."
cadillac,cts,2004,Tim, 09/22/2018,2004 Cadillac CTS,3,"My Cadi drives well. But when I get the speed up to 40 or 50 mph it fells like I am losing power.

The interior is comfortable but is a little boring and kind of cheaply made. I am very disappointed with the stabilatrack which has gone haywire on me after 45000 miles and a rattle coming from the engine somewhere, after about 30,000 miles. other than that the car is wonderful, turns on a dime, good acceleration, handles good, and brakes good. "
cadillac,cts,2004,NateC, 09/27/2008,Classy car decent prices on preowned,4,Owned the car for about 6 months. No problems or fixes as of yet. Pretty good power for a V6. Considering K&N Intake. Smooth ride and great handling. 
cadillac,cts,2004,Murry, 01/15/2009,Ameri-can't,3,"It handles great in dry conditions, but not in snow, which is miserable. Fuel economy is disappointing for a V6 with VVT. The transmission makes a whinning noise, and the car is known to have issues with trannies. Comfortable, stylish, and fun, but not quality, reliable, or practical. Overall a decent value IF you get it at a cheap price, but I'll never buy another caddy again- HIGH maintenance costs, and not great quality. Get an Acura- 10x the quality for about the same price.  Do not even consider if you drive in winter conditions."
cadillac,cts,2004,2smooth, 04/04/2009,Good try but going back to an Import,4,"Wife crashed the toyota 4runner and my Honda S2000 was stolen off the drivway.  So I decided to go with some class and give GM back a chance... WRONG CHOICE!!!  The CTS 3.6L with Navi and 17"" wheels was a good try for GM but this car still does not compare.    Quality is poor as paint interior on knobs are chipping everywhere and my side skirt is loose, memory settings get messed up on the sideview mirrors.  There are recalls on the CTS with the steering linkages.  My alignment needs to be redone every year so far and now it is acting up with suspension noises. Brand new these cars are great, right up until you add some mileage on them. Overall,still fun to drive while looking good doing it"
cadillac,cts,2004,ppilsner, 01/14/2010,Problem with Timing Chain,3,"So excited to buy my first Cadillac.  Certified pre-owned and have had regular oil changes.  Manual says nothing about replacing this chain for the 3.6 engine, but does so for the 3.1.  Just out of warranty, and paid off early.  Chain broke with no warning whatsoever.  Research and mechanics have said this should not have happened at this mileage.  In the shop right now and we're up to $2100 and counting.  Anyone else had a problem with timing chain?  It's just wrong!  Dealer is not wanting to make any adjustments, passing me off to corporate office.....very unhappy with my decision to purchase this american car.  Between brake and shock problems, it's a regret."
cadillac,cts,2004,Bud Utecht, 04/13/2010,Mixed Emotions,4,"The CTS does not enjoy slippery conditions. Not a car to drive in Maine. While a great fun car to drive, it is a very expensive car to maintain. Tires will last about 24,000 miles, and don't hit a bump or you'll blow out a $650 rim. We did have significant electronic problems, which may have been due to dealer incompetence. "

really feel the 50%/50% front to rear

Even an NSU Ro80, for those of you that 
know what that is! And, as noted, we 
own a new 3-Series and an E-Class right 
now. This car can stand proud with any 
of those. Is it as good as a 2004 BMW 
330i? No. But it's oh-so-close, and the 
price differential is substantial (in 
the Cadillac's favor) when equipped the 
same way - loaded with automatic

the CTS better."

Catera's.  The first one had a few 
problems, the second virtually none.  
We shopped around and drove other cars 
in the same class.  We ended up with 
the CTS, Cadillac's owner loyalty 
incentive was the financial clincher.

We love the way the car drives.  With 
the new, larger V-6 and less weight 
than the Catera, combined with the 5-
speed automatic, it is very quick.  The 
handling is very tight and precise.  It 
is fun to drive!"

cadillac,cts,2004,Scott, 10/23/2005,Dead Batteries and Dies Out When Driving,3,I have been having problems with my 2004 Cadillac CTS since 7/2005 with the car dying out while driving on three occasions and I have had to have the battery changed twice. My car has been in the dealership for roughly one month while they are trying to figure out what is going on. They are not having much luck. They are only working on the dead battery problem. They gave up on finding out why the car dies out while driving. After my experience with the service level of the dealership and the Cadillac corporate people I would never buy another Cadillc. Buyer beware.

very impressed with the power and 
smooth acceleration.  The cabin is 
extremely quiet and roomy when compared 
to some of the competition.  The Bose 
system and XM make a great 
combination.  We just had a snow and 
ice storm and for a rear wheel drive 
vehicle it handled extremely well in 
the snow mode with traction control on."
cadillac,cts,2004,LDT, 01/26/2004,"Nice Ride, needs work",4,"I have never bought a Caddy, but 
knowing this car was designed to 
compete with European cars made me take 
a closer look.  Even though I do not 
have the sport suspension, it still 
handles quite well. I also do not have 
the Bose stereo, but it still cranks 
out the sound.

What I do not like is the cheap boom 
box center stack.  GM just can't seem 
to figure it out. The climate control 
is also poorly designed. They used the 
same controls that was in a Buick I 
rented last summer.  Guess it was a 
cost saving thing.. but if you want to 
compete with the real sport sedans....

The info center is also hard to read 
and the controls are poorly laid out."

Until October 2005 a seal broke in the trunk and it took all of the 3 inches of rain from the sky into my interior. Everything was totaled inside. Since then Caddy installed a new interior. Every week I get a new rattle along with panels falling off the interior. It sounds like a Yellow school bus when you drive it. I reached out to service reps and GM in Detroit. All on deaf ears. As long I  pay GMAC nobody cares.  I strongly recommend you choose wisely. For the first time in my life after 25 years of driving Cadillac, I have to try other waters (foreign). What a shame!"

drive.  Outstanding driving feel, 
beautiful new engine,(the 3.6L), and 
high content for the dollar.  Interior 
materials feel better than they look, 
no Altima-like hard plastics...  
Everything feels high quality, perhaps 
it is the light shine coating GM put on 
everything that takes away from the 
look.  Cant say enough about the new 
engine and transmission, I have never 
felt a more seamless auto in my life, 
this includes overrated BMW and MB.  
Couple small gripes--loose carpet near 
the driver right foot, but the 
dealer/GM will fix it no charge.  Cant 
beat the domestics on rebates either. 
EXCELLENT first effort by GM here."
cadillac,cts,2004,Anthony Clay, 02/14/2004,Ya! Baby,4,"I received the Cadillac CTS as a 
company car and it has been the most 
impressive company car that I've ever 
driven.  In the past I have had Volvo, 
Sabb and various General Motors, Fords 
and Chrysler's.  I really like the firm 
suspension without being considered 
bumpy. After driving the sob 9-5 I was 
surprised that he used more gas but I 
guess that's what you have to give up 
for the performance. The styling of the 
car is really progressive and is like 
nothing else on the highway.  For those 
who enjoy being different this is just 
what they're looking for."

2003. Cadillac was getting a lot of 
buzz, being that the XLR and SRX were 
getting ready to roll into the 
dealers, and that the CTs has been 
getting a lot of buzz. I checked out a

smooth but sporty ride and the firm,

Unless you must have manual

I'm overjoyed at how amazing this car

only one option... the engine 
upgrade/auto trans. The car literally 
floors me with it's bold styling and 
performance. I thought I'd regret 
dropping the options, and although I'd 
rather have a V or a loaded model, I'm 
extremely satisfied. I do not feel 
that the editor's rating on Edmund's

to give a reliability rating but it 
finally feels like Caddy got this 
right.  It wanders a little more than

2001 which I thought was a very well-
built car. The new CTS leaves the 
Catera in the dust! Wonderful handling 
on the open road, and when you use the 
cruise control, you get a cruising 
range of 400+! The seats are extremely 
comfortable (both front and rear), and 
the temperature controls make riding in 
extreme heat or cold a non-issue. I 
am 'floored' that this is not in the

drive will convince you."
cadillac,cts,2004,hemiguy61, 03/09/2004,CTS Surprise,4,"The automotive press is missing the 
boat on this one.  The styling is 
distinctive and different and I like 
that a lot considering the sea of 
boring imports out there.  The CTS has 
great power, gets good gas mileage, is 
comfortable, has a ton of storage and 
overall is a ball to drive.  It has a 
great turning radius and is a snap to 
parallel park in the city.  What more

vehicles.  It is much larger inside 
then the 330 which I considered before 
this purchase.  The road noise is 
almost non-existence in the car.  I 
was a little concerned about the

260 horsepower. It really is

amenities.Had to purchase the available 
packages but it appears stripped with a 
lower price to attract new younger 
purchasers. Car is small inside but 
very enjoyable to drive. Not really the 
best sedan for company in the rear as 
it is cramped.Nevertheless,very 
enjoyable in the city and to park."
cadillac,cts,2004,Skuuteroo, 04/30/2004,A real nice surprise,4,"I bought a CTS with the 3.6L engine and 
automatic. The ride is much quieter and 
the road imperfections get absorbed 
very well, but there is a slight sense 
of disconnect compared to my previous 
car (2003 Tiburon). However, the car 
handles (even w/o 
the Sport pkg) extremely well. Body 
lean is negligible, and steering is 
precise. I don't consider the interior 
to be luxury oriented as much as 
techncially sumptuous. It's definitely 
upscale looking and wood belongs in 
furniture and buildings, not cars.
It's great to feel good about owning 
a ""reward"" car that's made in the USA.

I have owned Audi and the CTS is a 
refreshing change. Cadillac has a 
truely fine entry-lux car with the CTS. 
If you are looking at BMW, Audi, Saab, 
Lincoln LS or Lexus-give the CTS a test 
drive, you will be pleasantly 
surprised! The CTS handling/drive is 
very impressive- feels like a sport 
sedan should."

nothing but great things to say. It 
performs well, the ride is great, its 
fun to drive and I feel great driving

the same price and opted for the 
Caddy.  I love the secure, comfortable

awesome,the light platinum w/ebony 
interior gets raves from my 
passengers. Even the carpeting is 
plush and elegant. The OnStar hands

to the CTS--I've put 11,000+ miles on 
it in 4 months & thus far all is well.  

Once I got used to the rear-wheel 
drive, I found the CTS has terrific 
handling and cornering capability.

It has killer acceleration & a smooth 
ride--but there's also the unnerving 
factor of finding yourself driving far 
faster than you intended.  My CTS gets 
around 25-27 mpg on the highway, 
driving 80-85mph on average (!) 

The only problem encountered so far is 
having a bent rim (probably from a *&^ 
MI pothole.) Overall, the quality of 
this car is excellent.

this much fun driving is it? :"

any of them, luxury-wise.  I also have a 2000 Mazda
2k Miata LS. The CTS isn't even as sporty as the Miata.\
Well, maybe it can keep pace with it on a 
straightaway but the Miata would kill 
it in the curves. Make no mistake the 
CTS is NOT an all weather Corvette.  

THE GOOD:  The new CTS has great 
looking sheet metal, ergonomic steering 
wheel and console controls; shiftable 
automatic transmission w/sport and snow 
options. It does have a trip computer.  
Its a dry pavement 0-100 monster.

THE BAD: It felt drifty on the highway

alignment before 5,000 miles.  The dealer couldn't do
it the same day and the fix cost me $50 at an alignment 
shop. "

(whatever is on the cts-v) and they 
told me it was not available but I 
could purchase the tires, rims and the

$900.00 each rim and $200 each tire. I 
did not even want to know about the

I ended up purchasing a 2004 Cadillac CTS.  The best car to me means, in the highest 5% class of all cars made for safety, comfort, drivablity, performance, reliabilty, operating cost, and total value.  Spending months investigating automotive publications and internet reviews, comparing detailed specification data, and driving many of the cars that met my stringent requirements, only two cars remained out of all the competitors. They were the BMW 5-series and the CTS.  The one area that seperated the cars by a wide margin was CTS's high value/lower price for the better overall offering. "

I have made sure the oil was changed every 3,000 to 6,000 miles as needed.
Just with in the last month my CTS started cutting back when my wife was driving it.
I checked oil in car & it was fine. dealership
did a diagnostic test on the car and contacted me that same day and advise that the CTS had no issues & everything checked out fine.
Within two weeks she was experience same problem I checked oil level & it was no oil at all.
Went to pick up some oil put in car.
Then I test drove the CTS next day & had no problem until I picked up some speed then it cutback some and engine light came on.
 When I went out to leave on tuesday it would not start out all & had to have it towed to dealership.
Thats when I was told that i need a new engine.
The repairs would cost $6200. I have recommended Cadillac CTS to numerous people never again.
I am disappointed I had a chrysler sebring before this car that I traded in with 230000 miles on it.
Cadillac is suppose to be a step above that.
Its wrong how this economy is set up to bail out GM but I can't even get a $6200 repair covered by the company that should have failed."

 They car was sounding weird and I had my husband check it.
It needed 5 quarts of oil.
There was no warning, or light.
The catalytic converter went out in it twice in a year and a half and then I started having a misfiring problem.
Whenever I was going up a hill, or had to accelerate fast, my whole car would jerk and then my engine light would start flashing.

I have owned several gm products and this is the first one I have had with this problem. would I buy another one no way. gm needs to man up and fix this problem and not charge the consumer who spent their hard earned money to buy a car they thought was going to be reliable. no wonder people are turning to Honda and other cars.  bad when you have to carry oil in the trunk of your cadallic. im not the only one check internet. when you ask dealers about the problem they say thats the first they have heard of problem. i say bull

The worst part about it was I didn't figure this out until the car was down 4 qts and started to make lots of noise. No LOW oil level or pressure indicator.

cadillac,cts,2005,Paul Shorts, 12/18/2015,Fun to drive but...,1,"Jumped into this after 4 years of driving a Buick Century. Couldn't resist the feel and performance, and fun of the 6 speed manual. Had great luck with the cheap old Buick so I figured I'd be safe purchasing another GM product. Purchased the car with 92,000 miles and it looked and drove like new. Had all dealer service records so I thought I'd be safe. Whoops! 

Pros - The car handles amazing, and is extremely comfortable and fun to drive.

Cons - At 105K a grommet on the gear shift went out. Could still get 1st - 6th gears fine, but couldn't put it in reverse. $300 part, but Cadillac was out of them, and nothing aftermarket was available. Had to drive for 2 months with no reverse while waiting for the part. Sortly after purchase I noticed I was having fairly high oil consumption. Never had a car do this so I contacted Cadillac. Told them I was burning 2.5 quarts per 5000 miles. I was told by a mechanic at a Cadillac dealer that ""that's really low consumption for the 3.6 motor"". Now with 170K miles on it, it's using 1.5 - 2 quarts every 1000 miles. At 126K the motor broke a valve. Needed a full valve / upper motor job. $3500! At around 125K the traction control / ABS started acting up. Traction control engages when not needed, and occasionally the ABS engages when stopping, which can be a little scary. Transmission started leaking at about 125K. Too expensive to fix, so just keep adding oil to the MT when I change the oil. At 150K the brake lights quit working. Turns out it's a problem with the wiring loom. Repair was ridiculous so I just re wired it myself direct from the relay to the brake lights. Right catalytic converter now needs to be replaced. Can't get an inexpensive aftermarket cat in California. Going to be dumping this ""beauty"" as a non-op when it's time to get it smogged. Still can't believe that my cheap old Buick ran so well and never had a problem, and the sweet Caddy has literally been a piece of junk.

This is in addition to normal maintenance such as brakes, tires (of which I've need to put 2 sets on) and oil changes. Also it burns oil at about 1 qt every 2000 miles, I found this out after I nearly ran it out of oil and the computer shut the engine off (there is no light indicating low oil). I like the car, but I probably wouldn't buy  another."
cadillac,cts,2005,Mikey, 08/11/2010,2005 CTS,4,My CTS is one of the sharpest looking cars I have ever owned. It's fun to drive and drives & feels like a sports car.  Unfortunately it has many problems. The oil consumption is ridiculous. Right now it's using a qt. every 600 miles. It's terrible to drive a Caddy & have to carry oil in your trunk. The braking system fails often when I'm turning into my driveway or a parking space making it a major safety hazard. Mechanics have not been able to find the problem as of yet! About every other month I have to replace a burned out brake light.  
cadillac,cts,2005,bigsim, 01/07/2015,I don't know what you guys are talking about.,4,"Bought my CTS 4.ago and I love it, had a oil leak  which was repaired under warranty. It does use a little oil so I keep an eye on it, this is a sports car I don't think a lot of people understand that so you have to be vigilant on upkeep I love this car and would recommend it to anyone ...Again this car is not for the person that doesn't take care of their car all the blown engine problems I bet can be traced back to some kind of abuse."
cadillac,cts,2005,Bamaguy, 09/08/2010,A lot of problems at higher miles,3,"Bought the CTS over a year ago and everything was tight and good. Since then i have replaced rear transmission seal, front drive shaft seal, front drivers wheel bearing. It uses a quart of oil every 2,000 miles and the radiator has a leak. On the interior, the dash has cracks from the sun and the leather seats are not wearing well. At 70,000 miles and easy mature driving this car is a disappointment. Sad to say, but it will be the last GM i buy. "
cadillac,cts,2005,nothappy2010, 12/14/2010,This Vehicle Might Become Your Casket,1,"My Navy son was involved in a serious 5 car collision involving my 2005 CTS.
The AT-FAULT driver hit my son from the rear, causing him to hit 3 more cars.
ALL safety features failed, causing injuries to my son.
NONE of the airbags inflated and the seat belt failed to restrain my son.
General Motors will not return emails and/or calls-after spending countless hours with my car.
They are skirting the accident, which is why I filed a formal complaint with the Consumer Safety Division.
Now GM will be required to supply my family with answers.
Had my son been hit a mere 10mph faster - he may have suffered severe injury, maybe even death!
Thank God he is okay."

I love this CTS as does my wife who is not a ""car person."" I have not had any type of problem in these first 9 months. My car is black with all options made plus numerous dealer extras, rear spoiler, back-up light louvers, grill, custom ss exhaust system, cold air intake, complete interior wood and more. Often people stop me to say it is beautiful and ask more about it. I am a car nut and not easy to please but this one has done it. Style is of course a matter of taste but I think this has it all. I have heard some negatives on the interior but do not agree."
cadillac,cts,2005,Gloria, 07/06/2008,Satisfied,3,The leather on the driver's side started to split and have dry cracks in less then three years old and I wonder if it is due to the heating element in the seats.  This is the first time having the heating element on my seat and I welcome this during  the winter months but the leather did not last.  The leather type material around the joy stick element is starting to peel exposing the metal.  The black paint around the stereo CD is starting to peel as well.  The electronic seats on the driver's side starts to squeak when it goes forward and backwards.  Don't know what causes this when the passenger seat does not make this sound.

Nobody cared to help get the warrenty company to pay for any repairs as they all told me there was nothing wrong even though I was going thru almost 5 quarts of oil every 3000 miles. other than that I love the car although the airbag sensor and the passenger seat went out right after the warranty was up.

cadillac,cts,2005,Hammer, 08/02/2009,Blown ENGINE at 46K,2,"Just over 46K on this car and it needs a new engine!  There was no warning that it had burned all the oil up. After reading more reviews I'm not the only one. I was just out of my warranty, but GM did try to help saying they would pay for 50% of the replacement.  Not so fast! Turns out they have to replace the motor the ""GM"" way, the dealer wouldn't even quote me a price.  After asking again he said that it could run more than just putting in a new motor.  Thanks, but no thanks! I'll put in a new motor, how's that for BILLIONS of bailout money?  I'm sure our kids/grandkids are very happy with our investment.  GM should have DIED, don't buy a Caddy."

Dealer charged me $100 to reflash the ECM which (unknown to me) was under recall and should have been free. Now it won't start and service airbag light is on. Center column plastic is peeling. Will never buy another Cadillac .  "

I have read the bad reviews and my response is find a new mechanic!  3 timing chains? Really!! The water pump in my CTS also failed at 34k miles. dropped off in the AM and picked it up after lunch. Each vehicle has its problematic issues and I think I can deal with a new water pump.. The dealerships that fix them are not the manufactures and they are not all the same.."
cadillac,cts,2005,avguy, 11/10/2009,Worst I have ever owned,2,"This is the worst car I have ever owned. I had to replace the entire valve train at 70,000 miles at $4500 and now at 87,000 miles a connecting rod went and now needs a new engine for $6100 and yes I changed and checked the oil. That's how I knew it went through a quart about ever 2000 miles. If you are looking to buy one of these don't. I will never purchase another GM car, no wonder they are in so much trouble."
cadillac,cts,2005,r41866, 02/14/2007,"Nice Car, but Still Some Things to Improve",4,"The CTS has a small turning radius and good traction, even in rainy days. It also has very good braking performance. Its acceleration is not very impressive, but maybe it is due to the heavy weight. Its fuel efficiency is so so. Its ride is comfortable, except that the engine noise is quite loud.  Its quality is OK, except for a problem with the automatic window."
cadillac,cts,2005,Ryan, 08/26/2010,Terrific car since new,4,"I bought my 2005 CTS Luxury Sport in Oct, 2004 with 300 'demo' miles on it and have beaten the tar out of it.  I currently have 97,000 miles on the car with minimal complaints and overall, would not go back to the '97 Audi A4 I traded in for it (Caddy blows its doors off). While the 3.6 is known for oil consumption, it was purposely built at the high end of tolerances to free up horsepower.  Consumption remains just under 1 quart per 2000 miles, which is within specification.  Aside from brakes and tires, I have had a water pump, rear differential seal, and a headlight module replaced (all under warranty). Overall, I love the car, and it remains rattle and wind noise free after 97k miles."
cadillac,cts,2005,swaz, 01/29/2010,CTS,2,"I have owned my CTS since it had 8 miles. I got 75K miles out of the first set of brakes. I have maintained the car religiously. It is by far the worst car I have ever owned! I would not buy another Cadillac or any American car ever again. The quality stinks. The closer I have gotten to 100K miles the worse the car got. Was told by Capital in Atlanta, GA. ""sorry, they didn't install an oil light in this year model"". The car will alert you of everything, just not low oil."
cadillac,cts,2005,Steve, 10/07/2010,Would buy again,4,"I bought this car almost 3 years ago in Dec. 2007, and I love it.  It was a certified car with the 6 yr 100,000 mile warranty, and I was glad I got it -  In the first year, the passenger air bag sensor went out & the sunroof switch failed. In the second year, the car was run low on oil and there was no dash light to indicate this.  I was given a new engine for free under warranty at 65,000 miles. I haven't had any problems in the past 18 months.  Despite these issues, I really love the car.  All of the repairs were free under warranty, so that didn't bother me much.  The car handles great, has lots of power, is very comfortable, and with my fully optioned car, is really luxurious.  "
cadillac,cts,2005,ziskie, 02/27/2006,CTS review,4,"My CTS' handling has been exceptional.  It glides down the highway and has gotten lots of ""wows"" on ride quality from friends who have been in it.  The soundproofing and speaker system are very good.  I like the style too - it sticks out in the crowd without being ostentatious.  There are lots of BMWs and Mercedes where I live, but my Caddy looks better and gets more notice."
cadillac,cts,2005,William lacina, 09/09/2016,Great car,5,"I love my 05 cadillac cts sedan! It performs great on the road. With excellent acceleration and handling it is easily the best car I've owned. The quiet cabin is great! Hardly any road noise at all. It was a great buy as a used vehicle for me and my family. Perfectly reliable for over a year now too. No complaints.

Engine seized up 9 months after I got it (is always made sure oil changes were ahead of schedule). Luckily the warranty covered it....cool. It started making a noise in transmission, so I had to replace the flex plate and torque converter. Now my check engine light turned on and I have multiple cylinder misfires. Awesome, had to fix that. Now due to all the rain we've been getting, I'm finding at least 2 leaks and there's water EVERYWHERE! Now I have to drain all the water out and clean all the mold that's growing in my trunk and passenger side. Stay away from this car! You might have the same bad luck like I did.

I purchased 1 month ago and driven the car another 2,000 miles! My car had 22,674 miles on it. The drive is smooth and quiet. I traded a Toyota Solara. I can't believe the ride difference. I also have a 2005 Acura TL. The Cadillac's ride, feel and quality so far are better than the Acura! The gas mileage is the same as the Acura at 23 to 25 mpg combined highway and city. The steering wheel controls are excellent. The car is tight and looks brand new! I have the Navigation with Bose system and XM. Wow it has fantastic sound. The two tone seats and wood trim, make the car stand out!"

It has had the following problems: full set of replacment tires before 25,000 miles, a LOWER END OVERHAUL before 35,000 miles, a headlamp at 3 1/2 years, a battery at 4 years, a water pump at 45,000 miles, and numerous small problems.

somewhat paranoid about buying an

Going over a bump, the car shimmies and has bad tire bounce.  The back seat is very uncomfortable due to the bouncing.  I took it back to the dealer and was told that this is how the car rides, it has a sporty ride.  Someone should have told us this before we purchased it.  We cannot take it on long trips, it is too uncomfortable.  Our Toyota Camry rides much better, for much less money.  Also, I've had to replace the passenger rear tire twice due to flats.  People have gotten into the car and asked if it has shocks. I test drove the car before purchaseing it and it did not ride like the one we bought."

Quite frankly, I could afford the other luxury vehicles (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) but none of them had the same qualities I found in my CTS.

Shutting off the car for a few minutes brings it back. Check engine light came on once. Dealer could not find the fault. Reset and been ok since. A car of this price should have more than an ugly black plastic dash. (something GM changed in 2008) Minus? Depreciation. The worst I ever experienced. This 3 year old car is not even worth 40% of what it cost new. Seat belts are awful. No passenger grab handle. Quite an omission in a $45,000 car. Overall the CTS is a very fine $25-30k automobile. But $45K? Forget it."

However, over time, the ride seems a little harsh over imperfect roads (which most are around here).  I like the look of it and the fact that it represents at least one American car company that is attempting to compete with the imports.  I know there is a trade off with ride and performance but I was expecting a smoother riding car since, after all, this is a Cadillac.  I like the volume control on the wheel.

The perfect car...1 week before warranty went out took it to dealership in jacksonvilel NC, they said car was in tip top shape,  2 weeks later the water pump seals blew out, water pump seized up & the synchros for 1st and reverse stopped working.

One is for driving in the snow and the other to place the car in the sport mode. The sport mode changes the configuration of the transmission. Test drive the car and push the button to sport mode.  You will leave all competitors behind. The salesman at the dealership thought it changed the suspension, but this is not true. It's absolutely incredible how this automobile performs in this mode. It is not recommended for normal driving, for your gas milage will decrease dramatically. Test drive it!"

It still turns heads, and is comparably rare.  Ample power.  Cons (Good grief!):  Fit & finish.  Maybe it's just my car, but the seat bottom rocks from side to side, there is a rattle in the left front dash, the moonroof cover rattles, I am experiencing windnoise, etc.  The dashboard is not sporty or luxurious.  It is down right ugly compared to dash in the Acura TL.  Bad mileage.  Tight interior space.  Load 4 average adults, and you'll know.  Loud engine. The steering is too light.  Make sure to get the get sport suspension.  If you want to drive a proud American car with unique looks and are willing to overlook build quality, this is the vehicle for you."

Its interior with heated lumbar seats is accomidating, welcoming, and deserves your cruisin' time.  The Bose sound sytem is excellent.  You can't drive this car without the music blaring.  The navigation system helps if you stink with maps, or are just lazy like me!. I replaced the wheels and rims for 20"".  I guess automakers haven'tcaught up yet in the tire department.

After some twenty years of Nissans, Mercedes and Porsches, I am now back to a good old American-built car.  The Cadillac CTS has it all -- whether on a superhighway or in the driveway.  Solid, positive handlng, even a powerful engine that runs on 87-octane fuel.  Who would have thought?"
cadillac,cts,2005,Cadillac done right, 06/29/2005,Cadillac a winner,5,"I have had many new cars, this is my first Cadillac but will not be my last. I am very satisfied with the ride and performance. Everything works and works well.  I looked at Audi, BMW and Benz models in this price range and they did not come close to ride, roominess or smooth performance."
cadillac,cts,2005,SteveB, 06/29/2005,World Class,4,"While many would argue that buying a Cadillac vs. a Lexus is crazy, the simple fact is that I purchased a car based on the enjoyment I recieve while driving it instead of considering only the ""re-sale"" price for the next owner.  The CTS handles very well (this from someone that used to race Camaros in SCCA autocross), it has plenty of power for normal (and somewhat spitited) driving and fits the driver like a four door Trans-Am.  The rear seat provides plenty of room for ""adults"" vs many competitiors that provide onlly enough leg room for pre- schoolers.  In other words, if you are considering a BMW, Mercedes C-Class, or Lexus ES or IS, you would do well to drive a CTS before buying."
cadillac,cts,2005,Ken Neal, 07/10/2005,2005 Cadillac CTS 3.6,4,Have not had any problems.  Fun car to drive not only the accelerating but it hangs to the road with a small turning radius.
cadillac,cts,2005,Jim Stewart, 07/22/2005,What a thrill!,4,"The power is exhilarating! The road maneverabilty is great. It corners very well and it turns around ""on a dime"". I highly recommend the CTS to everyone."
cadillac,cts,2005,cadillacmike, 08/13/2005,"Sharp car, great performance & handling",5,"This is my 6th Cadillac, and my wife absolutely loves it even if she won't admit it. It has rather sharp styling (I like the STS better) but everyone likes it. The black is real nice when it's clean. Power and handling are superb, interior comfort is unsurprassed, and Cadillac continues to refine their memory system, this car can remember the seat position, radio settings, climate control, exit preference, Twilight Sentinel settings, mirrors, and it even has a personalized name for each key holder! The XM Satellite radio is superb. We were originally not going to get the navigation system, but once she found out that it can play DVD movies it was all over. You can even watch while driving!"
cadillac,cts,2005,Ken, 08/13/2005,My New Car Experience,4,I have not gotten the performance or gas milage that I understood that I would get. I don't know what is wrong with my car but it is not the same car that is discribed in these reviews.  It just does not measure up to other cars that I have owned.
cadillac,cts,2005,Nick, 08/13/2005,Incredible Car,5,"I have had the car for six months and 15,000 kms with no problems. It is great to drive, the transmission is silky smooth, and it has great power in all ranges. GM has a winner here."
cadillac,cts,2005,Everett Coker, 08/26/2005,Cadillac CTS 2005,4,The ride is smooth and the handling is good.  Car responded when asked and was quiet while riding.  A/C could be a little quiter.
cadillac,cts,2005,NatsCTS, 10/24/2005,Loving my CTS,5,"My CTS is very nice, I enjoy driving it.  I have had no trouble at all with it and it's sleek and sexy.  It handles the road with such precision.  Test drive one and see for yourself!  "
cadillac,cts,2005,Mine!, 10/28/2005,Very pleased,4,"This is my first Cadillac - I was considering my first non-American purchase since buying a used Honda from a family member several years ago.  My father has had several and purchased an STS in the past couple of months in black - which was the color I thought I wanted.  When I put my feature list together, the dealer could DX the car in silver, white or red.  I love the red!  People make a point to tell me they like the car."
cadillac,cts,2005,CadillacMan, 10/29/2005,Best in it's class,4,"Before I got my CTS this year I was driving a 2003 Cadillac Catera, which the CTS replaced. The Catera was a poor attempt to compete with the other luxury automakers who had made entry level automobiles. The CTS though is a vast improvement that not only looks better, but drives better, and comes with much more standard equipment and even better options. This has been one of the best cars that Cadillac has made so far. I would guess that the CTS is probably one of Cadillac's most successful vehicles since the STS, which also took the same form as the CTS when they were remaking the Sevilles.  It is just a little larger but for the most part it is the same car. The CTS is also nicely priced."
cadillac,cts,2005,xtranaut, 12/22/2005,My New 04 CTS,3,"Now, you might think me sick. I just traded my 2001 Jaguar XKR for a 2004 CTS. Object: get practical and stay sporty. First drive on the car - great, smooth, and agile on the freeway. Around town, it is noisy and a little clunky though. I have the sport suspension. This car is loaded except for navigation. The interior trim is really American cheesy. Why can these automakers spend a little more to make a little more? You can't play with the Germans and Japanese unless you at least MEET their specs. The dealer did a faux CTS-V package with mesh grille, spoiler, and 18 wheels (from STS) with new Michelins. Plus the color is a premium red. It looks like a hot streak.  It is only what Chevy should have done with Impala."
cadillac,cts,2005,CML, 01/21/2006,Luxury and Performance!,4,"My CTS is an amazing performance vehicle!  What a great combination of luxury and performance!  It is definitely the most fun car I've ever driven.  It has incredible ""pick-up"" and gets out of the way of everyone rapidly.  I get comments from even strangers regularly about ""what a nice car"" you have."
cadillac,cts,2005,TGR, 02/04/2006,2005 CTS,4,"My 2005 Cadillac CTS is a pleasure to drive. I drove it 3,800 miles in three weeks and had a blast.  Its performance for a 255 hp V6 is great. The best part are the perks associated with Cadillac ownership. The Mid-Missouri dealership treats us like family. I will purchase again. "
cadillac,cts,2005,Zldjan, 03/27/2006,CTS lives at the shop!,3,"This car has been nothing but problems from the day I received it. It has had problems with its electrical system, transmission, clutch, alignment, differential, driveshaft, tires, interior trim, you name it.  I have had to make multiple trips to the dealer to get the same problem fixed.  Me and the rental guy at Enterprise car rental are now on a first name basis  At this point I have gotten GM customer service involved and I am hoping they come through and do the right thing.  This is my first GM and so far Im not so impressed with the quality, but the car is sexy and it has helped me meet some wonderful people in the towing and car rental industries. "
cadillac,cts,2005,Happy Owner, 04/21/2006,Happily Surprised by GM,5,"This is my first Cadillac. I am absolutely delighted with this car. It came with no defects, and rides like a dream. My German friends tell me that it rides better than a BMW. It holds the road, without the extra suspension package. It does not dip in curves. It has terrific road feel, but still is very comfortable inside. It has lots of room for passengers, including tall ones. The CTS has good trunk space. Highway driving is a pleasure and city driving great. With the 3.8L engine it has very good pickup, lots of power under the hood. IT has good acceleration on hills. My gas mileage has been 21.3 overall, which is unexpectedly good. The radio is a dream with 8 Bose speakers. The cooling has separate controls for driver and passenger, more than enough. I'm hooked."
cadillac,cts,2005,fontes, 05/23/2006,The best i've driven,4,"What I like most is the modern, stilish design and beyond all this car's stability. It is a real experience to drive. I have never had a better car to drive and park in tough spots.  Its' turning radius is excellent."
cadillac,cts,2005,tfranklins, 07/09/2004,I love the stick shift 2003 Cadillac CTS,4,"One design flaw - - -cup holder is 
right in front of the gear shift, not 
bad if you're driving an automatic 
transmission, but not good for a manual 
transmission, where you're always 
shifting - - -you drink(water bottle) 
is directly in the way of you hand!  
That's the only problem I can find with 
the car; otherwise it's a fun drive! ! !"
cadillac,cts,2005,bijon, 07/13/2004,sg,5,"Drove, the 5 series, the C & E series 
and the Lexus 330 and 300.  None 
compared to the overall sport, comfort, 
and response of the CTS.  It may not 
have the best resale, but that was not 
a consideration."
cadillac,cts,2005,CTS fan, 07/21/2004,I love my new black 05 CTS,4,"I just traded my silver 03 3.2 w/220hp
for a new black 05 3.6 VVT /255hp with
sport susp.pkg.,17''whls. custom chrome 
grille and chrome exhaust exhaust tips 
too. It's a real Hot wheels cruiser and 
really looks good.  Now I am in love 
with the car !!! Its night and day 
between the 03 and 05 with greatly 
inmproved driveability and performance. 
Not to mention the mx satellite radio, 
Onstar and built in phone. It's very 
cool.  I would have bought the V/series 
400hp  but at 47 i could not get 
interested in the manual transmission 
and playing with a clutch during rush

cadillac,cts,2005,RR Fait, 08/09/2004,We love our CTS!,4,"I purchased the CTS for my wife. She 
feels so safe driving it thanks to the 
frame structure design that resembles 
that used by her favorite Nascar 
driver, Scott Wimmer and the Cat car!! 
I have to admit that I feel secure also 
but my review would go deeper by saying 
I really like the handeling on curves 
and in tight places, it's excellent. I 
would like to have the instruement 
panel a little more visible, especially 
when the steering wheel is in my most 
comfortable position. This is (overall) 
a very beautiful automobile to own and 
operate. Hats off to GM on this 
concept.."

whole different animal. I really,

I have had over 40 new cars and this is
one of the worst.

The car cannot stay in alignment and 
already have had six new tires in 10K
miles.

The car is noisy and the whine or howl
in the transmission is getting worse. 
The dealer says it is comes from the 
rear end and Cad has no fix at this
time.

I have a 2004 Toyota Solara and a Lexus 
and they both put this car to shame. GM 
must do better to keep my business."

usual suspects (3-Series, C-Class) with 
stand-out styling and performance to 
match.  Cadillac really got this one 
right.  The engine is flexible with 
lots of torque AND loves to rev.  5-spd 
auto is so smooth.  This car has great 
turn in and response to input.  It's 
roomy enough for two kids in car seats 
in back.  I love the styling, although 
I know this is polarizing design.  I've 
gotten lots of ""thumbs-up"" and 
compliments in parking lots.  Growing 
up with imports, I decided to take a 
look as I'd heard great things about 
CTS.  I could not be happier with my

holds its own.It moves when ever I ask

is an American car lets me know that it is totally
 reliable.  It has excellent acceleraltion, compared 
to the BMW 330i and in my opinion it is way more

cadillac,cts,2005,cadaddy, 01/01/2005,New Fan of CTS,4,"This is my first venture into the 
luxury market and the CTS is a real 
nice blend of luxury and performance.  
The size is just right and the 
features are great for a personal 
car.  A 6 CD dash-mounted player, 
satellite radio and OnStar handle all 
the entertainment and the 3.6L engine 
is strong enough for quick driving (I 
couldn't justify getting the more expensive
V-series and it's potential for speeding tickets).  
My only complaint is an amplifier that 
has not performed a few times, 
rendering the radio silent.  It was diagnosed 
and will soon be fixed when I get the 
time.  I got the redline color and the 
17 inch chrome wheels.  It is a 
beautiful car, although I may lose it 
to my wife."

the lot of the same dealer and asked to
drive it. Cadillac was not on my list of
cars to test so imagine my surprise when
I was amazed by the performance.
Continued on my new car quest with more
import test drives, and after all was
done ended up back at the Cadillac
dealer and purchased the CTS. Not only
did I get a fantastic car I got a
fantastic deal ... with the current
weakness of the dollar against foreign
currency (esp. the Euro) I saved many
thousands.

The CTS is a true ""Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde""
car ... a luxury car that turns into a
raw sports car at the whim of the driver."

The doors close solidly, and the fit and finish suprised me. This car is much quieter (wind noise) than my STS was. I highly reccommend it."
cadillac,cts,2005,happy caddy, 03/18/2005,2005 Cadillac CTS,4,"Once I decided to purchase a Cadillac CTS, it was a very easy task. I picked the color with the sport and luxury package. What more could I want, besides a CTS-V of course? Well, was I surprised, once the snow melted off the roads, this is just a great car to drive. What fun is is to see eyes looking at my Cadillac zoom by.  There are a few things that I think Cadillac could improve on though.  I like hand brakes, I can't even see the parking brake petal when driving.  Also, I know that this is minor but couldn't GM find room to put the date somewhere on the navigation system's screen.  Overall I'm HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY with my CTS. I can't wait for 2007 model with all wheel drive."
cadillac,cts,2005,andy matt, 03/18/2005,Good to go,4,"The 2005 Cadillac CTS is pleasing for the driver who has a long commute, but when out on the open road likes to have a comfortable ride with acceptable performance. It has lots of room in the trunk.  Its front seats are comfortable and have enough adjustments.  I don't know about back seats, I don't use them.  Its steering is taut, brake feel is good and handling is better than the average mid size sedan.  The engine response is peppy and the transmission is one of the smoothest I've driven.  The drive by wire response sometimes feels a little wierd but feeds in what you want most of the time. This is a great car, but there already has been a recall to reset the ECM apparently on all 2004 and many 2005 models."
cadillac,cts,2005,myredcar, 03/20/2005,Excellent,4,"I haven't had a chance to put many miles on it this weekend, but my new CTS is a dream!  I spend a lot of time in my car, so the interior quality was a big priority - I am impressed.  I was planning on another black car, but nearby dealers offered only white, silver, or red.  I picked red and am thrilled with my choice!"
cadillac,cts,2005,Jay Hayden, 04/06/2005,Cadillac CTS,4,"I have had a good experience wityh my 2005 Cadillac CTS so far.  The car is quiet and tight without rattles.  It has a firm ride and does not sway when rounding curves at high speeds.  I like the leather interior, and so far it has been very reliable with no problems whatsoever.  I am not crazy about the angular exterior design, but the styling is not too bad.  The car still gets a lot of attention and nice comments from friends and neighbors.  This is my third Cadillac, and I prefer American cars because in my opinion, they are less expensive to maintain, and this Cadillac is much more roomy (especailly in head room) than many European and Japanese cars which cost a lot more."
cadillac,cts,2005,Eric, 04/27/2005,Check out this car,5,"The Cadillac CTS is comfortable, has great performance, and has great looks.  Anyone looking for a sports sedan that doesn't want to be cramped should check it out!"

Have 28,000 miles on it with no quality problems, in fact brake wear is fantastic. All in all this is car with no competition."
cadillac,cts,2005,Beverly J. Vaughn, 06/20/2005,Great 4 Door Sports luxury car.,5,My husband drives CTS all the time. He is 62 and drives the CTS like he is 25. The accelleration is extremely good against similar foreign autos.  Although it is a 4 door sports car it does ride well. The 10 way seats allow us to ride very comfortablly while we listen to SUNNY (24) on the satelite radio.  Handling is teriffic. Sure wish the V8 wasn't so expensive after all I am 76 years young.  Happy Motoring.
cadillac,cts,2005,Wesley B. Payne, 06/22/2005,2005 CTS,4,"CTS is a very solid and potent driver. The handling is firm and responsive. The 3.6 L v6 is snappy and gives confidence. Overall it is a pleasure to drive and has a very sporty feel, yet still provides comfort for long hauls. "
cadillac,cts,2005,JERRY, 07/03/2005,Great Design; Sub-Standard Paint Job,4,"I love this car. It has a unique design and distinctive performance.  It is super!  Now for the cynical part of me: My unit has the ""Diamond White"" optional exterior paint, which cost $995 retail; $860 GM Employee price.   As you know, the factory robotic spray paint booth does its job flawlessly.  From 10 feet away, the car is very nice and pretty.  From 2 feet away, the exterior white paint is rippled (like waves on a lake) and the final clear coat paint is noticeably dimpled.  Not a world-class effort, IMO.  I did not appreciate paying extra for a sub-standard simple white application.  A much smoother paint job could have been programmed into the robots."

Obviously I have been highly satisfied with all, despite critics who bemoaned the ""unreliability"" of the Cateras (not true) and the ""lack of information"" on the '03 CTS.  My experience is that the latest CTS is a great car: fine performance, wonderful design and absolutely no trouble."
cadillac,cts,2005,Ron, 09/01/2005,Not a Real Standout.,4,"I've had mine for 5 months with 5,000 miles on it. I like the car generally, for the reasons I purchased it - stand out design, performance. However, I think it's a pretty average GM car in most ways. It lacks the ""luxury"" amenities you would find in other cars of this price range. For example, you get the same generic key fob as a Chevy Astro with no standard alarm or window roll down feature.  And no locking fuel door? Are you kidding me? And while the performance is good, it's nothing to write home about. Assembly is not that good either. Rear bumper cover feels loose, and the passenger doors have to be slammed to be shut properly.  While these aren't critical issues, this car can improve."
cadillac,cts,2005,Bill, 09/29/2005,CTS,4,"I bought this car based on the style and a friend's enthusiastic endorsement. It's a good riding car, but the engine runs much rougher than my Honda's ever did. I am kind of disappointed with all the plastic in the interior and with the low gas mileage. The cigarette lighter hasn't worked since I drove it off the lot. But...everyone loves the styling."

cadillac,cts,2005,Charlene, 05/10/2006,Love this Car,4,"I have owned this vehicle for a little over a year and I never get tired of looking at it or driving it.  This car makes driving fun and safe at the same time.  She has terrific acceleration when needed, has responsive handling on turns, and stops with control. In teaching my daughter how to drive she accidentally put her foot on the gas at a red light taking us dangerously close to the intersection, she then slammed on the brakes, the car never lost it's footing, all the safty features kicked in, ABS, stability control, and traction control.  We avoided an accident.  I now have signed her up for driving lessons.  GM thank you for making safety sexy."
cadillac,cts,2005,Mike, 10/11/2006,Not too Great for a Cadillac,3,"It has been many years since I have had a new vehicle spend so much time in the shop. Almost immediately I had problems with the rear end. They performed a bulletin on it but it was back in the shop a few weeks after with the same problem. Then they replaced the whole rear end. Next it was check engine lights. Then they replaced the gas tank. Next the rear end problem came back. Then came more check engine light problems. And then less intrusive problems started happening like the finish chipping off the most used control knobs, problems with the driver's power seat, problems with the nav system. I was ultimately pretty disappointed in this great looking Cadillac."

The design is very eye catching and has practical aerodynamic application. The interior is designed well. The control panel is easy to get to and manipulate. The  bucket seats keep me comfortable during my long drives. The navigation system has saved me more than once. The handling is very stiff and sporty. I was surprised at the turn radius. After driving a Lincoln LS for several years, I would have to say that this is a slight step up.  "

cadillac,cts,2005,rhaydon, 07/01/2007,Loads of Fun!,4,"This is my first Cadillac, although my parents have had several over the years so I am familiar with them. I am 37 yrs old and absolutely love this car! I  have the 3.6L V6 and it gets about 26 mpg highway and 19 mpg city. I average about 24 mpg and I step into the pedal quite often. It did have to go back to the dealer at about 3000 miles when the car started pulling to the left for no apparent reason.  It took 2 trips to the dealer, but they figured out it was a failed steering gear and replaced it under warranty.   Overall, this car is superb!"

cadillac,cts,2005,CawfeeTawk, 09/22/2007,Snow Joke,5,"While I've thoroughly enjoyed the way this car handles and drives, it's a nightmare in the snow. Long Island,NY had only 3 snowy days, one with real accumulation. This car couldn't even negotiate a one inch ridge of icy snow leaving me unable to get of a parking space.  I needed to be towed a few times over the winter because the rear wheel drive is so inadequate (even with ""Stabili-trac & snow traction engaged).  I never had this issue with front wheel drive cars and I would never buy or lease a rear-wheel-drive vehicle again.  With that said, if an all-wheel-drive version is available and affordable, I'd be in it in a NY minute."
cadillac,cts,2005,Jay, 10/23/2018,"240,000 and still driving",4,"I bought my Cts with 60,000 on it. Very nice ride and kept in tip top shape. Im currently at 243, 000 miles and I've only replaced water pump and starter. Love this car. It's been really good to me. I would always suggest that you have a second vehicle if possible. It does wonders when you dont have to drive your main car Every single day.

cadillac,cts,2005,Dmarie, 03/11/2019,2005 3.6 CTS 2nd owner 150k,4,"My experience with owning a 2005 3.6L CTS has been more pleasant then most, it seams.  The previous owner took exceptional care of the car and provided me with complete maintaince records.  I purchased the car knowing it had a strange sound coming from the engin but was shown documents from a mechanic that is was because the car needed a new cadalic converter.  I opted to purchase and have it repaired.  That ended up being completely incorrect information.  When looked at by my mechanic the noice turned out to be the cars timing chain.  That was awful news as it is a very expensive job.  The lowest quote I received was $2800.00.  Well I didn’t have the money for this and I never anticipated having to do such expensive maintenance right at go so with the advice of my mechanic I have kept the oil in check and use premium oil always.  I know this will only buy me a little time but it’s what I’ve had to do.  That was 3 years ago.  It still needs a timing chain but my CTS has been faithful to me and I can’t tell you how nice it feels to drive this car.  Ya the oil consumption is quite extreme but knowing this upfront, I’ve been cautious with regards to oil changes and frequently checks.  Other then that the car is great.  Now for another issue caused by my teen son.  Apparently Chevy vehicles have an interesting “theft mode” built in to them.  While my son was replacing the front door speakers he somehow set the car into theft mode.  That mistake cost me $800.00 and didn’t completely fix the issue.  The key still has to be monkeyed out of the ignition and none of my gages work or my traction.  I’m still able to drive the car but this is just rediclous that these isn’t a better solution to resolve this problem.

cadillac,cts,2005,Uni's Reason, 01/15/2020,"Over a quarter million miles, still handles like n",5,"If you only have enough $ to afford a 15 yr old vehicle, definitely don't buy a GM product of any kind-buy a Honda Civic or Accord! Can't kill em'! But I'm definitely a ""lucky"" Cadillac owner. I have an 05' CTS & it's got over 250,000 miles on it & it still drives like it's new. Still original engine & trans. I have a 2011 Chevy Traverse & it's garbage compared to my Cadillac. Problems you WILL have with old, high mileage Caddy's-catalytic converter will go out(had to use some hacks to get check engine light off to pass emissions), bearings-have fun-all 4 will crap out by 150,000. Alternator will go out around 175,000-200,000 too. Yes, mine guzzles & leaks oil as do ALL older GM/Chevy vehicles but that's a cheap ""fix"" w/ some Stop Leak. But keep a constant watch on your oil levels. I almost ran mine completely dry & there was no warning light. I'm not sure if there's an engine protector that will cut the engine before significant damage-I was lucky. Back brake light strip on trunk will burn out & costs a couple hundred bc its all one big piece so I go without it, not necessary for legal driving bc it still has the 2 normal brake lights. & a small electrical issue w/ the Automatic heat/air vents which is no big deal, just don't use those buttons. Other than that, this car is very mechanically sound & handles like it's brand new. It's expensive to drive a Caddy of any year or Model though bc they require synthetic oil changes($60-$100 depending where you take it) & they require Super or Premium unleaded gas or they run like crap-if you want your CTS to last & run at top performance, you cannot use regular unleaded! So again, they're expensive to drive & maintain. If you don't have a lot of expendable cash to throw into a vehicle on top of the purchase cost then please DON'T buy a Cadillac, especially an older one! They ain't cheap to insure either! If you're looking for a dependable, old, high mileage car-go Honda or Toyota! If you want only American, go Ford! Trust me! I LOVE my Cadillac CTS & it's still going strong for now but it's runnin' on luck & its just a matter of time. Also, mine has never been in an accident or had any significant damage(ie. water, hail, rust from salt) & has been garage kept it's whole life. Its also gone in for all maintenance checks, tune-ups & oil changes that Cadillac includes for free when purchasing one of their vehicles. These factors will significantly change the life expectancy of any part of any vehicle. If you don't do basic maintenance on a vehicle, it won't last & won't be a good, reliable car regardless of what make & model it is. Unless it's a Honda-they will run literally forever on nothing. My friend had an Accord with almost 400,000 miles on it, never changed the oil, never maintained it, never really put gas in it either-ran it on fumes-he died before the car did, in fact it's still on the street to this day-go figure...
A little tip too-manual trans lasts WAY longer than automatic just for some general info.

With its' sporty exterior I turn heads every where I go. The factory sound system is amazing quality. The seats are extremely comfortable and the dual climate zones make it even better. My 3 children never complain of being squished in the back seat since we have gotten it and I don't have to worry about their safety with the 6-point airbag system.

It never had a lot of power and the ""traction control"" would come on each time I pulled out from a stop.
I could live with that.


I started having issues around the 2nd year...
most of which was covered.
Now I am at year 7 and I have had nothing but issues for 2 years.
I have had to put several thousand dollars in for repairs.
Rear differential broke TWICE, Air bag issue, Wipers don't work, catalytic converter, misfires all the time, purge valve, spark plugs, and the list goes on.
I still owe 4K because it was a lease at first.

Shouldn't a Caddy last at least a decade or 120000 miles?
Very sad and disappointing."

The heated leather seats, wood trimmed steering/console and plush pile carpeting add a luxurious coponent to the superb handling.  My only complaint is the plastic grill on the front but I believe they have addressed this in the 2008 and 2009 models.

A great car for long drives: very comfortable seats, good standard sound package, low highway noise. Most important to us was its heft: we wanted something luxurious that would handle well enough, but also provide safety. The CTS is a good trade-off of performance and safety.

The Acura had a great interior with lots of standard features but, the exterior styling is so-so. In fact, it is not easy to differentiate between the Acura TSX at first glance.   The Cadillac has superior exterior styling and an interior meant to seem more serious like its European competitors. With comparable handling and better responsiveness from a dead stop or highway passing than the TL (due to a higher peak/flat torque curve at roughly 3,000 rpm) the CTS has my vote.  I made my decision based on rational objective reasoning. Throwing objectivity out the window, I feel better driving an American car. "

I love the crisp angular styling.  It is very comfortable for long trips.  The driver's seat is supremely comfortable (on the other hand the front passenger seat is uncomfortable). The car has been totally reliable except for a sun shade that came loose.  The interior has too much plastic and doesn't give a luxurious impression.  The car is priced like a small BMW or Mercedes but has the interior room of their larger 500 and E series.  One of the most endearing features is the extremely small turning radius.  The car is very nimble and easy to park as a result.

I will never own anything but a Cadillac for a daily driver ever again. The one small issue I have is the leather seats could be of a better quality leather but I think they addressed this already. GREAT CAR!!!!
cadillac,cts,2006,Angelo, 01/18/2006,This Car Saved My Life,4,"I loved the 2006 Cadillac CTS from the day I took delivery of it, but this past Sunday I loved it even more. My son and I were in a major accident and this car saved our lives. I slid on ice and hit a pole on my drivers side door with the pole falling down on top of the car. It bent the car in half, blew out most of the windows and smashed the roof. The impact of the pole was by my pelvis and legs. To my amazment my son and I did not have a scratch. The side curtian airbags deployed as did the airbag in the seat. This saved me from any trauma. The pole hit the drivers side window smashing it, when the side curtain airbag deployed it was between my head the glass and the pole. My family thanks you GM."
cadillac,cts,2006,RAN, 05/06/2006,An American Car Makes the Grade!,5,"For years I have driven foreign luxury cars because American car companies did not build the car I wanted to drive.  The CTS is finally an American car that has a place in my garage. The CTS is very comfortable, quiet, just the right size, has unique styling, and I am averaging 29 mpg on the highway. The construction of the car is very solid and the Cadilac Division of GM has done a remarkable job in following up to make sure I am 100% satisfied with the CTS.     "
cadillac,cts,2006,Nan, 05/19/2006,Rocks My World,4,"I have a CTS 3.6 Sport Appearance with the 18"" wheels/Luxury Pkg/automatic. After having tested several models in this class and higher I think I have the most striking and best of the bunch. It is comfortable, has great pick up when I need it, and is great for longer trips. Its maneuverability is great, it turns on a dime. I enjoy all of the little toys inside. "

cadillac,cts,2006,Dave, 05/08/2007,This transmission is normal?,3,"Least satisfying car I've had in many years. The chief problem is a transmission-- or is it in the electronics-- that wants to stick me in a lower gear whenever the car decides to. I went down a steep mountain in supposed high gear and was going 10 mph at the bottom when I just let it coast. Dealer gave me the old line about European-type transmissions. Another point, I long ago gave up on ever figuring out the information screen controls. Gas mileage is lousy too. Why did I trade my Grand Prix, an excellent car, to ""move up""?"
cadillac,cts,2006,CTS, 12/08/2009,Unpleasant.,2,"Excessive road noise,engine noise(sounds like a truck). It drowns out any conversation. Otherwise a fine car.The lease expires soon. It will be a Lexus this time."
cadillac,cts,2006,ccleary34, 02/26/2008,Great Value!,4,"I am coming up on 2 years of ownership. This is also the first time in about 15 years that I only have one car. I was worried about not having 4X4 or AWD but so far I have never been stranded in the few times there has been snow. Great acceleration and handling! One of the best I've owned. While some have more performance, utility, luxury, this Cadillac is the best blend I've seen so far."
cadillac,cts,2006,Chris DeWeese, 09/22/2006,Mixed Emotions,3,"My CTS handles like a dream and has plenty of power.  0-60 it is great, when in ""sport"" mode.  I can take corners that are posted 35 mph at 55 mph.  I have the 3.6L with the 5 speed auto and it is plenty fast.  I have two beefs, though.  The XM radio has static, which I thought was impossible on satellite radio, and apparently all CTS's with the single CD player do, too.  The response from the dealer/GM to fix it was underwhelming to say the least.  It still hisses.  The battery was replaced under warranty today because it died twice and I had to jump it.  Yep, the car has 7,000 miles on it and the battery died.      "

cadillac,cts,2006,Dorothy A. Watson, 11/21/2016,I will never buy another Cadillac,3,"I bought this car thinking it would be my forever car, problems the first year I had it.  I was rear ended I haven't been right since the accident and neither has the Cadillac. I have fixed many of problems since I had the Cadillac, but the last problem which I am experiencing with now is the Electronic Stability system.  I paid a lot of money for this extended warranty but to no avalibity it ended before I could use it.  I whole purpose I am question this is this ESS should be on recall why should I have to spend close to nine hundred to have this problem fixed when I have researched this and a lot of people are having the same issues.  I have a couple of friends that wanted to purchase a cadillac and I told them don't do it, it is not worth the money.

cadillac,cts,2006,irene w webb, 08/04/2007,Rear end noise and early tire wear,4,"I leased this car after having traded in a 2000 Eldorado with low mileage that I had purchased from a non-Cadillac dealership, hence, it was not Cadillac ""certified"" and the repair bills were getting costly. They certified my car and marked up extensively - I should have kept it!  The CTS was great - for the first 7,000 miles. I was rounding a corner on a rainy day and the car almost spun out of control and left huge - long - black tire marks on the road and the right rear tire seemed to lock up.  I got the car under control and my nerves settled and went on.   At 10,400 I took the car in for a noise in the back end and oil change. The service tech. told me I had to replace the tires."
cadillac,cts,2006,DudeinAkron, 11/30/2019,"Ugliest Interior, Cut-rate Design, Mech Failures",2,"Jeezus, the dashboard is hideous on this car. What was the designer thinking? The Deville had a tasteful, curved, flowing dash for the 1st time ever. Then there's the CTS. Weird shapes and cartoonish textures everywhere. Shiny plastic burlwood slapped on this year. Easily scratched.
The exterior is marred by the venetian-blind. front grille and too-flat bumper.
I bought a 3.6 Auto with 83,000 miles- with a mileage discrepancy recorded on the title. The dealer tricked me into signing off on this before allowing me to see the Carfax. Don't ever sign the report unless you've read it.
At less than 100k (allowing for a simple recording error in mileage) the 6 coils were shot- 5 cylinders were misfiring. What sounded like a flat tire turned out to be a carrier bearing buried deep under the exhaust and heat shield. About $2000 in repairs needed. And the trans seems to be slipping.
The car had factory 2 din Bose Nav Stereo- no CD to run it. Replacement? $129 if you so choose. Thousand dollar option rendered useless.
If you change the stereo, you lose the ability to change driver functions like alarm and power seat settings. Speaking of seats, they're gorgeous but so massive they rob the rear passengers of any legroom. At least they're heated- tho only high and low.
No heated wheel. Function buttons downgraded to 4 generic buttons and a volume knob with a mind of its own. Turn signal stalks overloaded with missing dash switches.
The ride is so choppy I deflated the tires to 30 psi. Anything to stop the pounding. Idle is super rough on reg gas, still bad on premium. Horrible mileage.
I upgraded to mesh grille and had to drill pinholes in front wreath and crest to attach it to the grille with jewelry wire. Right headlight HALF-FULL of water from bad seal.
And WTF is up with the trunk lid? it weighs 1000 pounds and doesn't pop up on its own. Replacing the struts made it go from impossible to open to impossible to close. The struts stop it a few inches from closing so it must be slammed every time. 
Verdict? Mistake. If you can afford it, buy Generation two. You'll still live in fear of engine, trans and driveline failure, but at least the interior look is improved in gen 2.

cadillac,cts,2006,BillF, 09/13/2008,Not what I expected from Cadillac,3,"My first and last Cadillac.  Love the car but have had problems with it since it hit 10K miles (rear end 3 times, computer once, electrical and now fuel pump problems)  Last experience it left me stranded (fuel sensor).  Dealer didnt do something right and had a major fuel leak after picking it up.  Cadillac will not stand behind the car and I cant even find the next higher person to talk to (Regional manager will not talk directly.  Have to go through customer service and they will not give any information).  Very disappointed and will never buy another one.  And they wonder why the imports have taken over the market.  "

Besides that, the Grand Am was the first new car that I ordered just the way I wanted it! But, even though the CTS is a used car, it beats the Grand Am hands down in almost all categories.  Comfortable, easy driving, nice appearance, lots of amenities, could have better gas mileage, but overall, a really nice car.  I am not sorry that we bought this car, especially since it is American made. "
cadillac,cts,2006,barbara stoothoff, 12/30/2005,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"My previous car was a Jaguar.  The Cadillac CTS matches or outperforms the Jaguar in ride, acceleration and handling. The Jag was already in for repair at this point. The Jag interior was a little more stylish though, the CTS is a little plastic even with the wood trim."
cadillac,cts,2006,Bruce, 07/20/2005,Awesome,4,"My wife and I picked up our new 2006 CTS today and it is awesome looking, rides great, handles great, has great power, and is very comfortable.  Its great sound system and it makes you feel good driving it.  And it does all this on regular gas."

I drove many others before driving the Cadillac including the BMW 330i, Infiniti M35, Audi A6, Lexus ES 330, and Mercedes-Benz C320.  Of these I had decided on the 330i and was ready to buy when I stopped into the Cadillac store.  They asked me to take a drive and give a honest opinion.  I was blown away.  This car out handled, out powered, and was flat out a better value than anything else I had driven.  This is definently not my grandparents Cadillac.  The imports had better watch out because Cadillac has their number. "
cadillac,cts,2006,buster90, 11/13/2005,There are better choices out there,3,"I am very disappointed with my 2006 Cadillac CTS. With a $36,000 sticker price you expect a nice car. It ha no heated seats, no rear seat ducts, no homelink, no power passenger seat, no memory seat, and no compass. This was a joke considering all of the competitors have these options at this price. If you want them...expect to pay around $40,000. The engine noise expecially dugint hard acceleration is loud, I expect this in a $15,000 Pontiac G6, not a $36,000 Cadillac CTS.  The build quality can't compare to Infiniti, Lexus, or Acura. There are better cars for the money."

I was all over the place, must have had a few mini heart attacks on the commute home from work. The worst was a few weeks ago, I was rear ended and sandwiched between 2 cars. No air bag deployment and my seatbelt brought me up to the steering wheel, then decided to kick in and pull me back, the car just broke apart. I was sad, but will definitely go with something else now, with better fuel mileage and NO REAR WHEEL DRIVE!!!!"

Then again it has a sunroof and that robs some headroom.  This car is a blast to drive. It corners like it's on rails and always has plenty of power on tap. Still turns heads too. Despite the head room thing it is otherwise comfortable for road trips.  Reliability has been top notch and good fuel economy.  If you are looking for a true drivers' car without having to shell out big bucks, look no further."

After the defects were fixed, the car handles / brakes / performs well, although the interior could use a little spiffing up, and the manual up/down shift control, integrated as part of the automatic transmission, was missing -- a standard feature on  competitors' similarly-priced models.  The following defects were all covered by the factory warranty, but still meant that I had to spend a lot of my free time during a couple of work weeks going back and forth a total of 3 times:  Trip 1: Defective left front strut Trip 2: Right front power window stuck Trip 3: Engine computer."
cadillac,cts,2006,Don Powell, 11/05/2005,Not to Shabby,4,"I got a white diamond 2006 Cadillac CTS with cashmere interior. The new interior looks much better than the 2005 model's. I also got the polished wheels with the luxury package which gives you lumbar seats and the passenger has eight way seat as well. The memory driver's seat is handy for multiple drivers.  The hands free phone is excellent along with Onstar.  It has a lot of get up and go which I don't really need but it is nice to know it is there if needed. The car is quiet, smooth and has excellent handling. I have a PT Cruiser and believe it or not it compares well to the ride and handling of the CTS. Getting in and out of the PT Cruiser is much easier but of course being much higher it should be."

I tried out the Mercedes C230 and was amazed that the CTS was far superior in all categories...this vehicle has it all! By the way, I am a retired GM dealer, but I have an open mind...I had enough new-car demos in my career that I am not easily impressed by cars, but this CTS is a winner."

The Bose sound system is an absolute pleasure to listen to and I loved the design of the volume control button on the steering wheel. Overall this is a a sophisticated, well mannered driving machine that is capable of competing with the German and Japanese luxury badges."

The Cadillac CTS has an excellent ride and handling, comfort, firm suspension and class.  GM deserves a lot more credit and customers than they are getting.  The CTS is a winner and I sell Audis and Porsches for a living!  The German cars are still the standard for safety, performance, and handling but for trouble-free affordable daily driving, I'll take the Caddy anytime."

If you want an entry-level luxury sedan, but don't want to be stuck with an ES 330 or a bulky Avalon, and don't want to pay BMW or Mercedes prices, this is the way to go. This car will take you from hip in South Beach to classic at your corporate headquaters and won't lose its cool. Way to go GM. "

Its seats and backseat leg room are great (better than in the BMW 3-Series, Mercedes C-Class and the Lexus IS250).  Having driven all of those I have zero regrets about my purchase.  My only negative is that the dash could have a little better design (especially if you have the base stereo and no navigation). Cadillac service is superb as well and they really take care of you."

I made the 4 hour drive to Vegas from LA and I didnt want to stop driving it was so comfortable. My girlfriend was able to sleep the whole way there she was so comfortable, which made the ride for me that much more enjoyable. But this car is quick, fun and roomier than it looks. I highly recommend at least a test drive."

I have owned it 2 weeks and it lives up to all my expectations.  The dealership was professional and efficient.  They certainly performed up to the Cadillac standard of excellence. So does the CTS. The car has great standard features and great appointments.  The fits and trims are every bit as exacting as the foreign competition.  The OnStar and XM radio are a great addition. This car makes my long commute enjoyable!

I drove the car 135 miles to drop it off with her, and by the time I got to her house I wanted to keep it myself.  This car is the best driving car I have ever driven! The features were excepional and the look is out of this world.  My mother was so happy that she cried for an hour.  What a great car!"

It ts a very smooth combination. The auto features a very nicely incorporated manual shift mode that is accessible with a right flick of your wrist. Pull back and it down and it shifts to the next lower gear. Push it up and it up-shifts. All five gears are accessible this way. This car is rear wheel drive with a 3.42 drive ratio. I have found 70 mph yields an engine speed of 2,250 rpm, which is good for less engine wear and highway gas mileage.  The interior is well laid out with the exception of the glove box which is big enough to hold gloves and not much else."

cadillac,cts,2006,Andrea, 10/15/2005,Out of this world,5,This car is a dream to drive. I knew it was a great car but I did not know what a thrilling experience it can be to drive a 'near' sports car for that amount of money. I have owned a Cadillac DeVille before (1992) but the two vehicles cannot be compared. I also own an SUV (other brand) and am delighted with the CTS's comfort. I finally found a car that more nimble and more fun to drive and ride in than a BMW (which I still own and will get rid of) or my friends' Mercedes. I test drove the Toyota Avalon before deciding to buy the CTS. My advice: Drive a CTS before buying the Avalon; the handling will convince you - plus the CTS has style and character.
cadillac,cts,2006,Glenn P, 10/07/2005,First New Caddy,4,"So far I am quite pleased with my purchase. I just returned from Las Vegas, a 600 mile trip, and got 25 mpg running in the high 70 to low 80's most of the trip. The a/c works great, the car has has lots of vim for passing, and is fairly quiet on the road. I wish the interior was a little larger to support my 6 foot frame. My wife loves the car and she's the one who made the selection."

I go back to the muscle cars in the 60's and 70's when I didn't like Cadillacs, but loved my GTO and Olds 442. I thought they were fun on the Georgia Highways at 140 mph, but they would not be a match for my CTS 3.6 Black Beauty, today. This car is a good reason to continue to cheer on our American manufacturers. Today at a stop light it smoked a Mustang GT to 80 MPH. He couldn't stay with it.

cadillac,cts,2006,Dan, 03/17/2006,The real deal,4,"Recently drove my CTS 3.6 from Monterey to Big Sur and back on the Pacific Coast Highway.  I drove at the limit up and down the hills and hairpin curves never using the brakes -  just the sport shift!  It was as if the car was on rails!  I own a Mercedes and have owned a VW and a BMW.  It handles just as well these do - but is more comfortable.  It glides in and out of traffic with terrifc acceleration and with smooth, effortless shifting. GM doesn't know how good a car they have.  Interior could be a little sexier."
cadillac,cts,2006,Mike L., 03/16/2006,GM gets it right,4,"I've have nothing but praise for this mid-size sedan.

The car is so good looking and gets many stares because of its polarizing looks.  It is suprisingly roomy and comfortable.  As for the performance the V6 has plenty of power, however I now wish that I got it with a 6 speed manual because with the automatic (even with manumatic) it does not feel sporty enough.  The leather is top notch and is softer than new BMWs and Mercedes I have been in.  Cadillac has almost hit a homerun with this car, it only needs richer plastics in the cabin (mainly on the console). This car is a great value too, much cheaper with more options compared to BMW 3- and 5-Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Lexus IS, and Audi A4."
cadillac,cts,2006,vj, 07/16/2006,"After a long look, I bought a Caddy",4,"I looked long and hard for a new ride. We test drove a Toyota Avalon, Infiniti, and Ford 500. I went to this Cadillac because of the exterior styling and a little improvement in fuel economy over my Tahoe Z71. We love the performance; I've also owned a Corvette and the ride and handling of the CTS are comparable and in some respects better given that the Vet blows you away with power. But I always wanted a powerful, comfortable family car that had some style and looks like I found it. The interior is roomy enough for the men in my family, all of them over 6 feet and 200+ lbs. But is quick and agile for me by myself."
cadillac,cts,2006,Alan Bradford, 07/15/2006,Before the Change,5,"This car is the perfect size and fit for tall drivers and suits smaller drivers as well.  When the change comes in 2008, may the same be said about the space."
cadillac,cts,2006,Cathleen Snyder, 08/14/2006,My Caddy,5,I have enjoyed every minute of driving my Caddy.  I took it to Pennsylvania last week and it handles the road beautifully.  I am completely satisfied.  Other perople come to me and ask me about its performance.  Others that own a CTS come and tell me how much they enjoying owning this car.  This is a beautiful car.  I am just thrilled that I have it.  My friends like riding in it too.
cadillac,cts,2006,Vic, 09/05/2006,Glad To Be Back In A Caddy,4,Cadillac has finally come out with a destintive looking car.  I love the design.  Inside and out this is a head turner.  I get excellent gas milage on the wide open roads of Nevada.  I was so impressed with this car that I traded in a 2006 Nissan Altima and took some loss on it.

It would be better if it were a little roomier and also if the passenger seat was automatic and not manual.  Other than those small annoyances the car is perfect and overall I love it!"
cadillac,cts,2006,jjmiller, 07/25/2007,Great car,5,"We purchased this car with 7000 owned by 92 year old man and it is too much car for a oler person, traded back to the dealer for a small and less equipment."
cadillac,cts,2006,Vsizemore, 10/09/2007,I like this car,4,"I purchased my CTS certified used. I was looking at several new vehicles, including both the 3 and 5 series BMWs, Audi. I never even thought of considering a Cadillac until I saw one at a dealership when I was looking at another vehicle. I fell in love with the design. I drove it and fell in love with it. I waited a few months to review it so I could really experience the vehicle. I still love it. It is unbelievably comfortable, has a smooth ride, and tons of features. I buy new cars about every 2 years. I will probably keep this one longer, and I'll definitely consider another CTS when the time comes, which I haven't done with a vehicle for a long time."
cadillac,cts,2006,complife, 09/24/2007,Cool Car,5,"Even though I have owned this car 18 months, I have just returned from my first 300 mile trip driving my White Diamond 2006 CTS 3.6 and I enjoyed the drive all the way there and back. It handled great (even on the Blue Ridge Parkway), the XM radio kept great company (no having to hunt for local stations), and I felt secure in knowing OnStar was with me all the way! This is my second Caddy - my first was a 1991 DeVille that I traded for the CTS. Oh yes, I got two compliments on my ""pretty car"" while at the resort!"
cadillac,cts,2006,ok, 04/21/2008,Just ok,3,I leased this about 18 months ago and it has been a very reliable car. It handles poorly with just the smallest amount of snow or wintry precip on the ground. The gas mileage is around 23 mpg with all highway driving.

cadillac,cts,2006,Dee, 08/30/2018,Visible But Not Overbearing,5,"It has been extremely reliable and easy to maneuver in traffic.  Parks easily with good backing up visibility.  Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of newer cars but sometimes simplistic is better.  Older drivers would like the ease of maneuvering yet visible in traffic.  Very comfortable ride and very low maintenance.  Gas mileage is remarkably good for an older car 22-27 in the city--highway.

cadillac,cts,2007,David, 05/20/2006,Luxury and Performance,4,This automobile has all the expected features of a smooth and quiet luxury ride and also has the quickness and power of a sports car.  It is great to take on the highway for business trips yet it is a comfortable family car for a family of five that includes three teenagers.  My 16 year old son relishes driving it.
cadillac,cts,2007,dennispalmer, 08/28/2006,Great Car to Drive,4,"The Cadillac CTS has very good quality.  Cadillac has done it right with this vehicle, from the styling to performance. The ride is very comfortable and there is easy access to all of the technology. I have had no problems what so ever with this vehicle would reccomend it to all."
cadillac,cts,2007,LYLE, 11/03/2006,Best Bang for the Buck,4,"I have this car for two weeks now and I am very satisfied with it.  I hate when some people write a review on a car without ever owning it. That's just plain hot air. If you are looking for Detroit quality, this is the one.  Mine is loaded with all available options including DVD navigation. Two major options are the 17"" wheel sport package, which by the way is the only wheel package that you can get with the navigation system and the 3.6 luxury package. I was luck enough to find the car in stock at a dealer in New Jersey.  Apparently, not too many are ordered like this one in white diamond with all the bells and whistles. I literally bought this car over the phone. Not to bad for Detroit Iron."

cadillac,cts,2007,Doug, 07/10/2006,2007 CTS 3.6L Sport Sedan is Awsome,4,The 2007 CTS 3.6L Sport is the most fun I have had since I drove Porches 15 years ago. I didn't know a sport luxury car could be this much fun. The OnStar and XM radio features were unexpected fun and insurance in the case of OnStar. Getting into the car and having the seat and mirrors go to my preset postions is a nice feature. The car has more than enough power @ 255hp ( I didn't get the CTS-V - V8 because of gas mileage). 
cadillac,cts,2007,Trey, 08/17/2017,VERY reliable.,5,"Enjoy driving this car.  The engine uses NO oil & is changed per the oil life monitor.   It is Black Raven with option package 1SB.  AC/heater extremely efficient.  Very good steering & braking.  Update, 2019.  This little Caddy is still delivering problem free service as a daily driver.  Still on factory original brakes.  Very pleased even 12 years later with this investment!

cadillac,cts,2007,gill123, 03/03/2013,J.R.'s CTS,4,"First Cadillac I've ever owned, got it back in 2010 picked it over an Infiniti M35 due to dealer cost. Sport model with 18"" wheels, limited chrome and spoiler definitely turns heads. For the most part it performs up to its looks which is pretty decent considering its weight and 255 HP. I like the Interior very much, love the plastic in the 2007, EZ to keep clean. Coming out of the a BMW 325i). I am good and uncomfortable; handling very good; braking powerful. Standard 18"" sport tires which led to all-season replacement after 40000 miles (at my expense). Overall mileage of 19.2. Next vehicle? I am now looking at the ATS. My 99 BMW was a money pit."
cadillac,cts,2007,Shirley, 06/03/2006,2006 Cadillac CTS-fantastic!,5,"Every time I drive this car, I become more impressed with it.  The style is sharp and distinctive. It stands out from the others that all seem to resemble each other.  The performance, acceleration, steering control, and comfort of the ride are incredible. It's fun to drive! I bought mine in ""Infrared"", which is gorgeous. This is the best car I have ever owned."
cadillac,cts,2007,fenwah, 09/07/2006,A Great Family Sedan that ISN'T Boring,4,"Besides test driving the CTS, I test drove a Toyota Camry, Toyota Avalon, Acura TL, Infiniti G35, and a Mini Cooper. The Mini Cooper won hands down, but I have a wife and two kids...so the Mini didn't win.  The CTS won.  So why did it win?  There was more room in the backseat than in its competitors...which the kids need.  I love the exterior of the CTS.  I was able to get a 6-speed manual with the CTS.  The seats were great...they hugged the body.  The interior was not as nice as the TL or the G35, but I just enjoyed the ride of the CTS more than any other car (besides the Mini).  I got the CTS sport w/ 18"" wheels...I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a new car."
cadillac,cts,2007,Nicole Van Meter, 10/20/2016,Huge Disappointment!,1,"My mother-in-law purchased this car  used (1-2 years old 8k miles). She is a senior citizen and wanted a reliable car for her remaining years. She had several Cadillacs in the past and always liked them. From the beginning it seems like this car was always in the shop with electrical and emissions issues costing my mother-in-law a lot of money (fixed income). She has maintained this car perfectly and always brings it to the Cadillac dealership for all work including oil changes. She has just turned over 80,000 miles and after hearing a ""knock"" brought the car in yet again and was told (by 2 mechanics) the low end of the motor is ready to blow! The dealership wants $6,600 to replace the motor. Wow.... really? It doesn't even have 100k on it.... What a hunk of junk! I personally will never purchase a Cadillac after her experience. If 0 stars was an option, that's what I'd give!"
cadillac,cts,2007,CTS4ME, 04/15/2009,I love this machine!!!,5,"I've owned the 05' and newer Accords and Camrys and the CTS is a far better vehicle for the money. It is a beautiful car and not just another ""SEDAN"". It's sporty and I love it. Not a single problem. Father in-law owns a 2006 and has never had any trouble. So, I decided it was my turn to have one.  "
cadillac,cts,2007,catmike, 07/19/2006,Smooth Operator,5,This car handles and rides very well. It accelerates quickly and has the power to maneuver yet it's easy on the gasoline. We do a 50/50 mix of city/hwy and get about 25 mpg average.  The interior is not plush but is solid. There is good leg and head room for tall front seat passengers.
cadillac,cts,2007,9mm, 08/24/2006,The Perfect Sedan,5,"I used to own a Mercedes and let me tell you,  is fantastic.  The Cadillac CTS' looks, performance, build quality, and comfort, are all superior to the Mercedes-Benz C-Class."

Yes, in other respects, this is a fun car to drive.  It has plenty of pep, gets decent MPG, handles very well, and has comfortable seating for the most part.  Based on this purchase experience (first-time Caddy buyer), it will be my last.  Reason?  There is more bang for the buck with the competition.  "

Then again Major engine issue at 19months!  The car has been a nightmare and the dealership is even worse to deal with in this regard.  I would never buy another Cadillac nor deal with GM.  I can't believe the poor level of customer service and then the poor level of quality of the car. I do like the style and look of the car, but it is a poor, poor quality car.  It is upsetting as you expect a Cadillac to be the best, not the worse!"
cadillac,cts,2007,Ali, 08/20/2006,"Excellent, Love it!",5,I used to buy Nissans and Hondas for all these years. I am very happy with the decision that I made to buy a Cadillac CTS.  It is just excellent.
cadillac,cts,2007,Julius, 08/09/2017,5 Years Later - WARTS come out,1,"Like a bad case of herpes - that night with that attractive someone later came back to haunt.  Purchased a low miles (35K) 2007 3.6L sedan based partially on my local mechanic stating that the 3.6L engine was 'bullet proof.'  I purchased from a Cadillac dealer (Val Ward in Ft Meyers FL) in 2012.  It was an attractive car that rode extremely well with decent acceleration and very good handling and braking.  Checked all the blocks by checking reviews, car fax, prepurchase check with independent mechanic.  Within months I started having problems.  First the ABS started going off (intermittently), making braking horrendous and dangerous.  Then noticed the engine started eating oil.  There was no (blue) smoke from the exhaust, but my mechanic suspected the emissions system (CAT, etc) was absorbing the oil leaking out prior to the bypass.  [Note - I should have cut my losses and sold this thing at that point, but the wife loved the car & the Mech thought it wouldn't get any worse.]  Later the check engine light came on.  Code said it was a Cam sensor - which was replaced (not cheap).  The light later came back.  Here's where it gets bad -- in year 5 of ownership at 100,000 miles the engine essentially went.  (All kinds of noises that was most likely timing chains / guides and perhaps other bad items from the crank case.  Keep in mind this car was driven easy by a female and I believe the first owner was elderly.)  Replacement REMAN engine is over $5K installed and rebuilding the existing engine with duel Cams is about the same.  Trade in value without major problems is currently extremely low around $3,000 thanks to Cadillac flooding the market with these vehicles.  My Mech (who sold his SRX with the same engine) said that Cadillac knew about these engine problems and has done nothing about it other than quietly fixing the problem in a later model year.  He also believed fairly early that Val Ward knew there was a problem with this vehicle before selling it.  Careful sleeping with this pretty babe.

What sold us was the low mileage & excellent warranty. My husband has a long drive to work and wanted something fun and comfortable from the domestic luxury market. He fell in love with the styling and handling, that was until he was left stranded not once, not twice but THREE TIMES over the same problem which the dealership, several engineers & technicians direct from GM HQ could not pinpoint after three weeks, they had never seen the problem before! The key was stuck in the ignition and would not start or release the key so they had to replace the entire ECM to get it to start!"

After 4 years on the road car is still tight (front end, doors and windows) with no rattles or squeaks. Seats are very comfortable and performance is spectacular. Have gotten caught a couple of times jumping on a green light a little too quick. Car is Raven Black and had the stock grill painted black to match. Appearance has drawn attention. At 4700 lbs fuel economy is not bad. As some have already reported, nav system can be complicated without the manual. Waiting for one to arrive. Otherwise love driving the car and can't wait for the next one in a couple of years. "

I was blown away that this car beat such noteworthy competitors. The power/punch of the car, the throaty sound of the engine, the opulence of the interior (outside of the stereo/technology) and the edgy look of the car was just terrific. Additionally, I see so many A4s and 3 series BMW's on the road, I know for good reason, but they seem very trendy to me. Downsides are the cheaper feel to the interior controls and stereo, as well as public perception around ""American Made"" vehicles vs the vaunted European and Japanese competition."

My only complaints are related to comfort and interior design. After about one hour in this car I want stop and fix the pain in my back, no matter how I adjust the seats. Our 2002 Camry XLE seating and interior features are superior to the Cadillac which is a shame. We'll never use this car for road trips.

The 2.8 V6 has plenty of grunt at low RPMs, especially in the lower gears! The engine is very free revving, even in the higher gears. The handling of the car is outstanding, as it is able to take corners at high speeds with ease. The engine is quiet, and only smooth sounds enter the cabin. The suspension is stiff, and has a rough ride quality. There is also lots of road noise that enters the cabin. Fun car if you want a Sport Sedan on a budget, but very unrefined for a luxury car."

cadillac,cts,2007,Supermatic, 03/31/2010,CTS Sport,4,"This car has been remarkably trouble- free over the past 34 months. Performance is quite good and ride is firm but compliant. Front seats, however, in no way compare to the Mercedes-based ones in my previous Chrysler Crossfire. Replaced the front brake pads, etc. at 26,000 due to mainly mixed suburban driving. Biggest warranty repairs have been the replacement of a piece of interior trim in the rear seat area and replacement of the entire radio/CD player/information center due to a fault in the CD portion. In both cases loaner vehicles were provided and work was done on-time with no hassles."
cadillac,cts,2007,Barry from LI, 01/28/2007,Sunset Blue Beauty,5,"I am very impressed with the performance and quality of the CTS.  I had been driving BMW's for the past six years but wanted to ""Buy American"" this time and Cadillac was the way to go.  I have the Luxury and 17-inch Sport Packages.  The ride and seat comfort far exceed the BMW with only a small sacrifice in handling.  It has great acceleration from the 3.6L engine with an automatic transmission.  It also has outstanding maneuverability thanks to a super-tight turning circle."

cadillac,cts,2007,SteveP, 08/26/2007,Not as Good as It looks!,3,"This vehicle drives well, but does not reach the EPA mileage. Has the larger engine (not the V-8) and performs well.  Noisy inside on rough roads - the combo of shocks, suspension and body results in some annoying reverberation over bumps.  There was no plan for the back seat passenger AC - on a par with the cheapest Chevy on the lot. If you want the back seat cooled, you have to run the AC fans on high and freeze out the front seat.  Trunk does not have the closer system - it needs a big slam to shut!"

cadillac,cts,2008,Jordan, 07/16/2016,Bang for your buck Queen,5,"I purchased my 2008 Cadillac CTS4 with the 3.6 direct inject V6 engine and most of the bells and whistles. The only options I did not get were navigation and parking pack. I have to start with the power train in this vehicle. The 305hp direct inject V6 is an absolute peach. Smooth, refined, and power all over the band. It's also very quiet, until you push it past 3500rpm, then she starts to growl. It's a great noise for a Luxury V6. The tranny, a 6-speed automatic, is one of the best I've ever used. It's buttery smooth and knows where (what gear) it needs to be. I've never had issues with either. Always follow the factory maintenance guide and requirements for maintenence. The all-wheel drive is great. I live in Buffalo, NY, and if there is one thing people know about Buffalo, is that we get a lot of snow. It puts the power down well. This car is also incredibly comfortable. I owned a small econo-car previously, and my back would cry at trips longer than 45mins... This car, no complaints at all. Very comfortable seats with 10-way adjustability. I'm very big on nice interiors, and the interior of this car sold me on it. It's beautifully laid out, nice use of perforated leather, soft-touch plastics, and wood trim throughout. I got the panoramic moon roof as well, which is beautiful during the night, or soaking up the sun rays on cooler days. There are, however, creaks and rattles all over the cabin. It's a shame, but the car is also cheaper to own than foreign competitors, so it's expected to see corners cut in places. The only other complaint I have about the interior is outward visibility. The pillars are very thick. It hasn't been a huge problem, but noticeable. Exterior is subjective. I was never really a fan of the look, only because my little eyes can see cost-cutting corners shaved. But, it is a sharp looking, handsome design. Modern amenities such as HID headlamps and LED light bars throughout make her a beauty in the night. I also opted for the 18"" polished aluminum wheels and spoiler, which make the car look a little more upscale and aggressive, respectively, in my opinion. Driving the car had been very nice. Smooth over rough roads, good road manners, although the weight does tend to want to drag it around corners sometimes, great steering feel, and plenty of V6 power. 0-60 has been run at 6.3 seconds for me at the track, on 93 premium. Practicality is good, not great(this is a luxury sedan after all). Fuel economy roughly 19-20 mpg combined city/highway. Cost of ownership has been low for luxury levels. Maybe I'm ""lucky"" or maybe I properly maintain my vehicle. Either way, outside of normal maintenance (oil, tires, brakes, etc.) and a few minor electrical faults (all have been very cheap (>$20) fixes or under warranty) this car hasn't caused me a single headache. If you are looking at buying one, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!! look at owner history, service history, car fax reports, etc!! Can't stress this enough. The car is a fantastic car, especially at the price you'll find them. But, it needs to have been properly maintained and taken care of.

cadillac,cts,2008,jimboc240, 09/08/2013,Car of the year?,2,"I owned the CTS4 with every option since new. (as well as many many other vehicles) I was generally happy with it, especially how it ran in the snow. You can't beat AWD. For a V6, it can move pretty well. The navigation and Bose sound system is probably its best point. It seemed to do everything well, but nothing stands out. I love our country, but the Germans really are on top in the quality department. On the surface, the interior looks nice, but the leather is thin, and everything else is just cheap plastic.
The drivers seat broke. They wanted 1200 to fix it. It came with ""heated windshield washers"" but they disengaged it due to failure after 1 year. With no fix possible. "
cadillac,cts,2008,Virginia Swisher, 01/24/2016,I'm not the only one who owned the Cadillac from H,3,"2019 April Fool's Day, 25°out, turn emgine on engine light come on ""engine hot"" How can the engine be hot? Told it  needed 2 temperature sensors $1200. Also needs 2 new rotors on front wheels $600 and a headlight is out. It will cost $300 just in labor just to get to the place to replace a headlight. Each bulb is at least $150 ( might as well replace boths). Didn't  need to replace on sensor, but total cost $1900. Finally, decide to get rid of the car. Talked to a loan officer who had the same model Cadillac who called her car ""The Cadillac from HELL"" 2018 was a mix bag, There has always been a problem with the door locks. I could never be sure they would work. Then it came to a head, when the remote wouldn't open the driver's door.  I could only open the door with the key in the door.  Tried to have it fixed, $500 and it still isn't  working, needs additional parts to the tune of another $500.  To fix all doors would be at least $500 each door. Also needed to relace the rear brakes again. 
2016, wound up as a decent year for this car.  (2014)10 months ago I bought a Cadillac CTS and what a nightmare.  I needed to replace the 2003 Buick Century with 190,000 miles on it. I've have had several GTM cars in the past and wanted to keep with GM, and this was going to be my birthday splurge. I decided to look for a used car with lower mileage, rather than a new car because I was on a limited budget.  I had looked at Chevy Impalas, Buicks  and found that they were exceeding my budget- so just as a whim- I looked on the internet at Cadillac and was seeing that there were a few that were in the same range as the Impalas. (I did CarFaxes on every car I looked at & before I took it for a test drive - this car came with a positive report- one owner, garage kept, well maintained, & 50,000 miles on it & it looked brand new- nothing to indicate that there would be any problems. ) So in comparing a Cadillac CTS to and  the Impalas- I thought I was getting a higher quality car- not so.  I picked it up at the end of February-        (they gave me a 3 month warranty).  In April, the check engine light came on- it needed a new coil (not cover by the warranty)  $500: in June, the catalytic convertor went (cover by the warranty, otherwise it would have been at least $700).  In July I took it in for an oil change and a check up and was informed it would need new brakes on the rear by the end of November (this would cost at least $400- wound up costing $500).  In September it just passed inspection (mostly because of the brake issue).  The middle of October, I was heading to work and there was the horrible clanking noise coming from the wheels- (no warring), managed to get to the dealership (which has been in business for over 80 years) and left it there. Next day they informed me that the drive shaft had broken (don't know how or why) and it would cost $1500 (they took off $250 from the bill). I informed them I was extremely unhappy and nervous about driving the car and I needed to talk to customer service.  She listened to me politely, said she wanted me to be secure with the car and they would take it in and do a complete check up on the car to make sure everything was working right.  They did that, then one week later I as was coming home from work, I heard this big thump. I got out of the car to check it and saw nothing- got back in the car and it went nowhere- the transmission went on the car.  I called the dealership and they couldn't believe this happened.  They gave me a loaner for the 6 days they had my car. The bill came to $2500, but I paid $750 (they got GM to cover most of it under a warranty).  At This point, I can't trust this car. My salesperson showed me another CTS, a year younger than mine w/ less mileage. So he discussed it with the head of use car sales, and he informed me that  they could only give me $10,000 for the car.  I can't
 afford to throw $10,000 down the drain and then spend an additional $7500 to get into that new car, so I left asking that they keep eye out for something comparable that I could afford.  I became resolved that I would have to keep  this car, so I put the new brakes on  at the beginning of December and hoped for the best.  On the Monday after Christmas, on the way home from work, the car began to vibrate violently as I began to accelerate.   Again I called the dealership and manage to get it there, and then left it.  They called me  the next day and informed me the car was fixed at no charge  (it turned out to be 2 coils & 2 spark plugs needed to be replaced- that would have cost over $700). I have checked into Lemon Laws- my car does not qualify, talked to a  friend who is a lawyer, called Cadillac Corporate to file a complaint-

I had a 2004 CTS first, and I had multiple security issues with it requiring trips to the dealer to fix. The my son totaled it when he hit a deer doing 75MPH. I do like the looks of the CTS, so I bought a 2008 CTS 4 as a replacement. It had 28,000 mi. I have had many issues with it as well. First, it uses oil, and the oil MUST be checked every 1500 miles or you will be in trouble. I checked mine at 3000 (after a #60 oil change since it uses synthetic oil), and NO oil registered on the dipstick. No leaks. CTSs just use oil. "

We had never had any issues with our first CTS so we were sure we would be getting another quality CTS. Our new CTS had 31,000 miles on it when we purchased it six months ago. It has been in the shop 4 times for major repairs-oil consumption, catalytic converter replacement, piston rings, cam shaft shims, steering and just this morning, the passenger airbag light is not working! I would expect these types of repairs on a 1980 Ford not a brand new Cadillac. I am half tempted to drop this car back off at the dealership, spend $ 500.00 and buy a junker that would certainly be more reliable than the new car I have now! "
cadillac,cts,2008,jmdhale, 09/18/2012,2008 CTS Blown Engine/Oil Consumption/GM fails to act,3,"I purchased a 2008 Cadillac CTS with 31K which was also the mileage at which the oil had been changed. My wife being the primary driver averages 33 miles a day and is very easy on the vehicle.
 At 41K the car threw a rod resulting in blown engine.
At the advice of GM the car was taken to my local Cadillac for repairs. Although the vehicle only has 41K and the power train warranty is for 100K Covert told me there is nothing they can do as my power train warranty expired 2 days prior to the break down. For $10,000 they will put a new engine in for me.
GM continues to tell me the warranty is good up to 100K, but states I failed to properly maintain my vehicle.

I purchased the car with 31,217 miles on it and have documentation from dealership showing the oil was changed at 31,107 miles.
The attached excerpt from my 2008 Cadillac CTS Manual states you vehicle computer will let you know when to change the engine oil and filter. This is based on engine revolutions and temperature, and not on mileage.
It goes on to say that one may not need to change their oil, but once a year. 

When Cadillac turned over their review to GM the local Service Manager wrote that our vehicle was 6977 miles overdue for an oil change.
The dealership went on to tell me that we should have the oil changed every 5k to 6k. Although the manual specifically states mileage is not a determining factor. Also using the 5K to 6K logic and the fact my oil was changed at 31K we would have been due for an oil change at 37K which based on their equation would only be 3K over not the 6977 reported to GM which resulted in denying my claim. Again GM states mileage in not a factor in oil changes. 

We owned the car just over 8 months and have only put 9,500 miles on the car. The dealership is stating the car ran completely out of oil and it was our fault. How does oil disappear when we have no leaks? This is not possible and Ive spoken to numerous certified mechanics who stated cars do not run out of oil in 9,000 miles unless you have a leak or the car has an oil usage issue which is the fault of the maker. 
Note this vehicle has 37 recall or service notices some related to power train and cooling systems. We never overheated.no check engine lightbut GM and dealership flat out said we are SOL. After a 2 billion dollar bailout this is what we get?"

At that point the '09s were out so I also got rebates for buying the old model year. I have been generally very happy with purchase. 

A couple of issues mostly relating to fit and finish. The car has some spots where the wood accents aren't quite large enough to fill the space they are in so there a couple of gaps here and there. Also, the car has a pretty bad paint job for a luxury car. It was like they only put one coat of clear on it. The car also has some interior rattles that seem to come from the bowels of the dash and can't be held down to be stopped. "
cadillac,cts,2008,Rick Croak, 12/10/2015,What is everyone complaining about?,4,"I bought my 2008 CTS direct injection new. Granted, I only have 55,000 miles but so far the car has only been to the dealer twice, under warranty.  Once for a part in the rear suspension and once for the XM radio receiver.  Other than that, the tires were replaced at 50,000 miles and I have changed the oil every 6-7000 miles,  based on the computer, or once per year. 
Also, being a C6 Z06 Corvette owner, I know what performance is about.  This CTS is a joy to drive and can really get up and go. The only gripe I have with it is an engine vibration ( I believe caused from engine strain from staying in gear too long) at 45 MPH. It could probably be adjusted out, but I can not see spending the money to have it fixed. 
The only other issue is that the trade in value is so low that I cannot make myself trade it because the car is so enjoyable to drive. Otherwise, I would probably have a new CTS.

My advice to anyone reading these reviews is that if someone is complaining about the reliability of their CTS they bought used with over 30,000+ miles (That's a lot to me to be calling ""new""!), you take that risk when buying anything used as the previous owner could have rode it hard and put it away wet with no maintenance.

Of course we bought this car used and as they say you get what you pay for, but as working people we cannot afford to throw our money into a car that is already needing repairs done.

cadillac,cts,2008,Big Al, 09/27/2009,Highly Unreliable,3,"In less than 24 months of ownership car has spent over 6 weeks in the shop being repaired or awaiting parts for a repair.  2008 CTS has had issues with timing chains.  Cadillac had to redisgn the part because of high failure rates according to the Cadillac representatives I have spoken too.  In addition, I have had persistent keyfob issues, accelerator sensor failures, nicked wiring harness, etc.  Cadillac has been less than sympathetic about the LEMON they sold me.  The car has been in the shop so often, it probably knows the route by heart.  "
cadillac,cts,2008,sp4rt4nz, 10/22/2009,"Great car, nice ride.",4,"My first American car, after several Japenese sedans. The styling and build quality are excellent. I've had a few quirky problems, but no less reliable than the Toyotas, Infiniti, and Nissans that I've owned. The CTS has been much more reliable than the G35 which I traded. The CTS has been a low maint vehicle as I do oil changes and tire rotation only every 10K miles. I've been averaging 20 mpg in mixed driving, which is a bit disappointing, but it only requires non-premium fuel. This is no BMW, but I also paid $7K less than a comparably equipped 3- series and the CTS is much roomier for a 6ft. 200lb driver. "
cadillac,cts,2008,Pboss, 11/24/2009,Not Alone,4,"I have had my CTS for almost two years.  Overall, I am mostly happy with my purchase.    Pros:  AWD handles great in Alaska Winter weather.  Styling is beautiful and have power to spare.  Cons:  Squeaky brakes since day one!  Most irritating:  rattle from steering column.  Both were deemed ""normal"" by dealer service department.  At $15,00 maybe these things are normal.  At almost $50K they should not be.  As much as I love this car, with the constant ""normal"" rattles, I will not be buying another GM luxury car.  "
cadillac,cts,2008,Chris, 05/11/2010,Been a great car,4,"Owned the car since early 2008 with 28k miles and it continues to work near flawlessly.  The ride is smooth, but still feels connected to the road.  The engine is powerful, though at times feels weak since it's coupled with AWD.  Besides regular maintenance, the only issues have been a broken trunk net clip."
cadillac,cts,2008,Mike, 09/22/2010,First Cadillac I've ever owned,5,"I've had this car for over 2 years and it has been great!  The only issue with it was a recall for the washer fluid heater but other than that it's been perfect.  This is by far the best car I've ever owned and I've had 27 cars!  Solid, quiet, fast and fun.  If you live in a snowy climate the AWD is a real plus, mine had handled 2 Minnesota snowy winters without a problem.  Cadillac did a great job with this and I would not hesitate to recommend it based on my experience.  "
cadillac,cts,2008,Lance Rineer, 02/23/2008,Best 6 cylinder engine ever driven,5,"We hope this new Cadillac ""6"" holds up as well as the ""8"" Northstar, as the performance for a six is absolutely incredible.  You would swear this engine is an ""8"" cylinder.  Low end torque and highway cruise from the powerplant is phenomenal within this vehicle.  "
cadillac,cts,2008,BarreraBoy, 01/16/2019,Major waste of money!!,3,"Went through two engines both gave out due to the same problem, and it wasn't because of poor maintenance. I loved my CTS but I had to give it up due to the repair cost and what I owed on it. But I wouldn't make the same mistake again if your looking to purchase one might as well be a new one not used so you know your getting something no has neglected or caused damaged to before.

The 3.6L DI is exceptional, fun to drive and the overall build quality is something I'm not used to from GM. There are several flaws in the vehicle that I'm experiencing (minor) such as the express close moonroof doesn't actually close on it's own and the steering has a light clicking when turning.  One major disappointment for me comes not from the car, but from GM.  Our nearest Cadillac dealership is 2.5 hrs away; somewhat a nuisance when repairs are necessary, especially when we have about 4 GM dealers in the area. "
cadillac,cts,2008,Ed Stolarz, 10/09/2009,Great 2008 CTS!!,5,"I have owned over 20 new cars so far and the 2008 CTS is Number 1 on my list of cars that I've owned! Its great distinctive styling and great looks, fabulous interior, great reliability and super handling makes it fun to drive and a real joy to own! Cadillac and GM have really done a great job on this car! The attention to detail and build quality is the best I've experienced! The interior in the CTS is truly a work of art! If you haven't considered or test driven the new CTS, you are not being fair to yourself and your missing one of the best car choices out there! The CTS is a super overall package especially with its great all wheel drive option! Give it a try and see for yourself!"
cadillac,cts,2008,blaid, 03/24/2012,Be careful!,3,"I've owned the 2008 Cadillac Cts V6 DI for about two years now. I was very intrigued by the new design and thought it looked very nice. I never bothered to look at the reviews or negatives about the car, so I screwed my self there. I bought the car used with only 24k miles on it and it's been at the dealers for minor problems six times within the two years! Now if the car didn't have a warranty these minor problems would have been a major price considering it is a Cadillac. Key less entry malfunctioned numerous times, wheel tilt control
and two windows as well. Engine would make noises and the tech's would not display any information to why. Don't buy it without a warranty, you will lose!"
cadillac,cts,2008,cadillacmike, 12/21/2011,2nd CTS and probably not the last,5,"This is our 2nd CTS. the first was a Black 2005 with EVERY option except block heater (we're in FL folks) and pearl paint. This one is the same, in light platinum (looks like the silver on my 2009 STS). It also has AWD. The 2005 went strongly to 117,000 miles when we traded it; this one is up to 30,000.

No major issues, but the ultraview sunroof is too noisey, something's loose because i can push up on the divider and the noise goes away. Handling is superb, inside room is good (I also have a Fleetwood and like my room), performance is outstanding. Noise level will be great once the roof is fixed. Eye appeal is without par, wife gets compliments on the chrome wheels all the time. "
cadillac,cts,2008,herb, 08/11/2010,What a disappointment,3,"I decided to take a chance on an American brand car after years of buying toyotas, hondas, nissans and mazdas. I loved the styling of the cts, and even knowing the poor reliability record of cadillacs and gm in general, I decided to take a chance on them. What a huge mistake! Within one month of owning the car, I had the first of numerous problems with this car. I had to have the sound system entirely replaced, and again less than one year later! From day one I experienced squealing from the brakes as I have heard many other owners have had. This is unacceptable in a so called premium automobile brand or any car period! The final straw was a non functioning fuel gauge. Maybe gm should hang it up!"

Combined mileage about 22.7 mpg. 26.8 hwy (non DI engine). Runs great, fun to drive. Excellent paint quality. I also own a 2004 SRX which has been okay, but had to replace xfer case at 51,000 miles.

This CTS now is at 38,000 miles with no issues. Great quality GM. I now own four GM vehicles. "

It started making noised at around 15,000 miles.
I ended up needing to have the entire driveshaft replaced.
The brakes have always made noises that they shouldn't and I just had one of the fuel injectors replaced.
It got stuck open according to the tecnician and the car started smoking and smelled like fuel.

The car is totally not worth the money I paid for it."

Cadillac CTS this spring. Two weeks of driving and it stops moving in the middle of traffic. Some strangers kindly pushed me to the side of the road. Called road-side assistance (joke) re-activated my AAA on the spot. Towed car to the dealer, they said, ""we replaced a modular"". No other explanation given even when I asked. On the way home I put on the brakes and that was the start of the squeaking sound. Six months later and to no avail the brakes are still squeaking. 
Also, I keep getting a lot of water inside, dealer response: Moon-roof drains are clogged. Not covered under extended warranty."
cadillac,cts,2008,Dr. Mike, 06/12/2008,Best Sports Sedan in its price class,5,"I have had the new CTS for three months and this is the most enjoyable automobile that I have ever owned.  All aspects of the vehicle are pleasing.  The performance is world class and the interior is set up in a convenient and comfortable manner.  The sound system is killer and the Nav is best in class.  However, the Onstar turn-by- turn is so simple and cool that I tend to use it instead of the Nav system.  I love the total lighting package from the very cool ambient interior lights to the trick light pipes in the front and rear.  This car is confident and capable in the canyons, the city or on the highway.  Great job Cadillac!!!  "
cadillac,cts,2008,Jamie K, 02/15/2009,"Dissappointed, and surprised",3,"Disappointed, and surprised. Others don't agree. My father picked up the newly redesigned CTS last year as his third Cadillac. As I am a huge BMW fan, the 2008 CTS falls way behind. First, big improvement over the embarrassing interior design of the first CTS, but the looks deceived me. When I drove the car, I was disappointed in many things. The driver's seat is too tight and not appropriate for a luxury car. The dashboard looks beautiful, but its functionality is poor, and again too tight a fit. Acceleration is typical GM, jumpy with an intense torque if you don't have a gentle-minded foot. The dealer-installed rear bumper proximity beeper is downright annoying."

Which btw u cannot properly configure on Edmunds as the options they list differ somewhat then what Caddy actually will do. Without question the car draws attention. Ride is smooth & very tight  though w/18"" wheels expect to get plenty of road feel; which is a new experience with Caddy.  I extensively test drove the BMW 5 & 3 series and this car matches them in >95% of handling characteristics. A- Trans is like silk. Extremely minor flaw in fit, but it would only be noticed by perfectionists :).  Rides very quiet, except on hard accel where you hear it growl. Motortrend said motor is rough at idle,  but mine is smooth"
cadillac,cts,2008,CTS-dad, 10/02/2007,Good after initial glitch w/ fuel gauge,4,This car has not disappointed us.  We have had it for one month now.  The car is very quiet; we cannot understand how anyone could have any complaints about noise. One disappointment: our car needed service during the first week we had it (fuel gauge was inaccurate and we ran out of gas on first trip...showed 1/4 tank when it was actually empty. Static electricity must have fried a chip or something. This problem was fixed by dealer service in a few days).
cadillac,cts,2008,Disappointed, 08/11/2010,Fustrated,4,"I just purchased this vehicle and was super excited when driving off the lot. Once I got home I noticed a ticking sound coming from the engine. Took the car back to the service center 2 days later. I'm told that the sound the fuel injector make is ""normal"". It's totally annoying and loud! Not that way I expected a Cadillac to sound."
cadillac,cts,2008,Evan, 05/31/2008,Proud to own a Cadillac,4,"I'm 36 and this is my second Cadillac, but this is no fuddy-duddy car like my '04 DHS was labeled. It's a car seemingly made for my demographic. I've never driven a car that turns as many heads and gets as many compliments and inquiries as this one does.  The steering feel and handling are superb. The throttle response and manumatic shifting can take some effort to be smooth, but that kind of adds to the fun.  The car likes to rev, but it lacks low end torque. It feels a little slow until you hit around 3500 RPM, at which point it takes off almost unpredictably quickly.  I also have a strange odor coming from the air vents, and have since day one. Not sure what that's about."
cadillac,cts,2008,wacojohnny, 12/13/2007,2008 CTS all options,5,"Well I also picked up my cts. It came in with everything including the wood wheel and shifter. I waited till now to write this because after a 1000 miles I have a clear picture of its performance. I have not found anything wrong with this car. It was ordered with every option AWD,DI,89U, spoiler, this without a doubt the most enjoyable car I have ever owned. The moonroof is great (here in NYC) the handling fantastic, the bose sound system and the HDD are great. No negatives at all. Great work Cadillac. The American car is back!"

cadillac,cts,2008,Carlos D, 06/22/2008,Sweet Cadi - CTS,5,"Wow, this car has exceeded my expectations and you must drive the direct inject V6 with 305 HP to truly appreciate it.  I've owned new BMW 5, new BMW 3, and new Audi 6 and the new 2008 CTS not only belongs in this class but outshines them all with ext/int design and features.  You definitely get more and more for your money.  The direct inject 304 hp engine is there to perform when needed.  The sport suspension package with 19"" wheels has the CTS hugging the road and gives it the tight feel. I love this car...it's the best 4 dr sport sedan I've owned and if Cadillac continues to deliver quality and VALUE there's no reason to go back to BMW, Audi, or consider others like Lexus.   "
cadillac,cts,2008,csf1, 07/15/2008,Great Car,4,"Great car for the money.  Only thing I dislike is the front seats are a little hard because of the heated, ventilated ducting.  Also gas mileage is a little less at 19.5 mpg than previous 05 CTS 21.5 mpg which may be due to the AWD and the car still has only 4000 miles."

The BMWCCA magazine Roundel recently did a comparo between the CTS and the 5 series and concluded that not only was the CTS an excellent auto inside and out, but was virtually the equal of the BMW for over $10K less.

The ride, the looks, the interior ergonomics and options were great. The quality of fit and trim, along with the value of the available features, trumped the competition. We decided that we wanted a vehicle that did not look like anything else on the road and this 2008 CTS does just that with the looks it commands from passersby.

The car was either the same or outperformed all the other cars.  The layout of the cockpit is fantastic.  The car rides great and people notice the beauty of the car as well.  My car has everything expect for Navigation and the Moonroof.  With Onstar I felt I didn't need the Nav. That saves you a lot of $$.  I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a luxury high performance car.  Definitely get the DI version.  Matt."

The car handles OUTSTANDINGLY, rides GREAT, and looks FANTASTIC!  My car has the performance package, luxury 1 and 2 and polished wheels.  You really don't need to spend the extra money for the Nav.  The interior lighting looks unbelievable.  And the best part is that the car was so much less then the BMW 3 series, Audi A4 and the Mercedes C class.  GM really did a tremendous job on this car.

That was my mistake. I looked the car over admiringly since, and was annoyed that at $40K+ car would not have a rear bumper that was aligned properly. The dealer informed me that it is a manufacturing defect and it is normal that the bumper be out of alignment on one side of the car or the other. ""The bumper is just too big"" was the actual reply. I've contacted Cadillac through their web site and been given a very thoughtful run around. I could have learned to live with the defect, having been a loyal GM owner for 20+, but the responses and lack of care make me wish I had not bought it."

Its stunning to look at, inside and out and with the FE3 package and 6speed manual, it is a true driver's car.  Most importantly, it is genuinely a quality piece. The body structure is incredibly solid; even with the stiff FE3 suspension setup it feels imperturbable. The interior isnt just excellent for a car in the mid-40s, it is actually nicer than a number of more expensive cars, with great fit & finish and superb materials. The Nav/Infotainment System is the best I have ever seen or heard. The exterior features Lexus like panel gaps."

I have yet to test this car in snow, although the fact that I can spin the tires on dry pavement does not give me confidence going into winter. I previously owned awd Acuras and BMW's which were excellent in snow.  Most of the consumer reviews I've read are positive in regard to performance. My view is that overall performance is defininately adequatebut I find that unless I stomp on it, I feel like I'm driving a big four cylinder sedan. When floored the car takes off but not without a lot of noise. The Acura RL I had most recently had a more refined feel. "

I've recently had my car in for some quirky problems and have noticed wear in the interior components including gaps between components. I think this is also contributing to noticeable interior wind noise. All-in-all the car still drives great and has handled excellent on snowy roads this winter.

Traded in 3-series for CTS.  Although exterior looks are subjective, this is one of most compelling-looking cars in the modern era. Interior is fabulous, as well. Nav system and hard drive are well-designed and easy to use. The pop up function for the nav is a great touch, as is the ability to display the radio info without popping up the nav. Ergonomics are excellent. I find myself looking forward to long trips - it just eats the miles. Glad to finally be able to buy an American car again without compromise. This car reflects serious attention to detail, baked in from lessons learned."

cadillac,cts,2008,ej, 04/21/2009,Piece of Junk,2,"Love the car when it's not in the warranty service shop. Have 24,000 miles on it, and it has had two major repairs. First, at 12k miles, the cheap plastic clips that hold up the wiring harness broke in cold weather and the fan destroyed the harness. Then after the check engine light came on at 24k, and the inferior timing chain had to be replaced. Now, I;m told the service codes indicate the cam/crank misalignment. Pretty sad for GM's ""flagship"" car line. Then there's been constant leaks in the door seals (repaired three times), which whistle above 40 MPH. The premium Bose sound is a disappointment  This is my 1st & last Cadillac."
cadillac,cts,2008,omegafiler, 04/24/2009,"Almost there, but not quite yet.",3,"I purchased a fully loaded 2008 CTS w/ DI brand new and ended up trading it in about 5k miles later. So you can see where this is going. Overall the car was great, fun the drive, and looked very nice. But after 6 dealer visits and a few annoying issues unresolved, it had to go. The big issue with this CTS and ALL of the CTS's I tested was poor build quality and materials. Every piece of plastic squeaks in the car from the center stack, to center console, to the cheap ""chrome"" bezel on the IP. Like rattles? Plenty of those around the sunroof, doors, etc. This is not what I or anybody expects from GM's 'best' car they are offering for sale right now. If GM can fix that, they might survive. "
cadillac,cts,2008,cpatterson, 05/08/2009,"Great buy, a few minor issues",4,"I bought my '08 CTS in August of 2008 as a demo car, so it already had about 5k miles on it. Have had no major problems or defects. The DI engine is awesome, especially when you use premium gas. There are a few rattles that come from the dash and the driver's seat does do some squeaking, especially when the leather is cold. My only complaint has been the brakes, which started squeaking about a month after I bought it. Dealer tells me it's because of the parts used and GM should have a replacement out by January '09 - but it's May and still no way to stop the squeaking. Brakes work fine though. Overall, very happy with my purchase - it's a beautiful car, fun to drive, and a really good price."
cadillac,cts,2008,Doug, 01/07/2008,CTS beats 535 hands down,5,"I drove BMW, Lexus Acura and Lincoln MKZ. After owning this car for 4 months it has proven that it exceeds the others in every aspect. Fit and finish in and out is superb plus it gets 30MPG on the road on regular gas. I just need more reasons to open the garage door and go for a ride. Thanks Cadillac for building the best!"

cadillac,cts,2008,psdesertrat, 01/13/2008,Architectural Masterpiece,4,"I purchased a AWD auto with all options. I've owned 20 autos in 30 years. This is the best design and execution of what I've owned and compared the CTS to. In two months, the CTS has been driven through heavy rain, ice and snow. It handles as well as any 4x4 I've owned. I traded my STS V8 and never looked back. It is by far the most tactile, entertaining, and visually pleasurable vehicle yet. I drove the A4 and 325 AWD's. In comparison, the CTS controls are the most intuitive. I could not figure out how to turn the BMW/Audi radios off during the test drive! With the CTS as good as it is, we cannot wait for the replacement of our DTS perfomance sedan. "
cadillac,cts,2008,Alan, 01/11/2008,Wish I had bought a Lexus,3,"The CTS has many fine qualities - ride, stability, sound system, interior design.  But the lack of certain features many of which are found on less expensive cars such a fog lights and a back-up camera, along with poor gas mileage (20% less than my 2003 CTS), and 7 days in the repair shop in the first 90 days of ownership tell me I should have bought a Lexus.

Nice having a car that gets compared to far more expensive models above its class.  My car, bought in Dec, 08 CTS AWD, DI, Black Cherry, loaded.  Handling nice, ride exceptional, quite, except for when you push it.  Sound coming out of the tail pipes makes you say bring it on.  This thing looks mean coming at you.  All the tech works nicely.  My only drawback is gas and break pedal could us a bit more space between.  Went to grocery store the other day some guy walked into the shopping cart holder looking at the CTS as I drove up.  GM finally got it right.  "

cadillac,cts,2008,Kristen Carr, 01/18/2008,CTS very happy with purchase,5,"No complaints so far.  We can't stand driving our SUV, ""kid school dropoff mobile"", anymore. Get ready for the 20 question a day from onlooker routine. Yes it's American. No it has good quality. Nothing has broken.  Gas mileage was as advertised.  Steering is not loose. Brakes are excellent. etc.. Trust me this goes on at any gas station, car wash, or valet restaurant."
cadillac,cts,2008,Sibica, 07/25/2009,Amazing car!,4,"This car has been incredible since owning it; gets more looks and comments than any car I've ever owned.  Sure, the mileage isn't great, but I didn't buy this to save a few $ on fuel.  Interior is SO quiet, build quality is fantastic, and it's a pleasure to drive.  In fact, my wife and I fight over who gets to drive it when we go out!  We chose the black on black, which really sets the car off.  Absolutely stunning to look at.  With regards to comfort, I'm 6'5"" and have no worries in the drivers seat.  Would suggest winter tires for the snow as it is rear drive, but otherwise not a problem.  Would buy another one in a heartbeat.  LOVE IT!"

cadillac,cts,2008,Mike MC, 01/31/2008,Reliability in question,4,"I loved this vehicle for the first 2000 miles and then it began idling roughly when in gear. Then the passenger window regulator went out with the window in the down position. The dealer has had the car for two weeks without being able to find parts anywhere. Cadillac, it seems, has failed its dealers and customers."

I have colleagues who have indicated such with their Lexus, Mercedes and BMWs - but definitely not the case here.  I've found that I look forward to going to work because I get to drive this car! I've had it for 3 months and it's been fantastic.  My friends with different luxury nameplates are envious and for the 1st time - considering a Cadillac. I love it."

Water getting in two cylinders, GM wanted to repair the motor, I wanted a new one.  Local dealership finally told GM it was a block problem couldn't be fixed.  Been in the shop 3 weeks, might get it back in a couple of days.  Caddy talks the talk but certainly doesn't walk the walk as far as customer service goes.  This is my 17th new GM car and the last.

cadillac,cts,2008,chelsialyssa, 02/17/2008,This is not your grandparents Cadillac,5,"I love this car! It is gorgeous. Truly beautiful. I had a 2006 MB CLK 500 Convertible and love my new Cadillac more! It is so plush, nice to drive, makes me want to take my time to get where I am going. Love the keyless entry - dont need to dig in my purse with a handful of groceries to get my keys, the door just opens! AND you can play DVD's for the kids in the Navigation system! I purchased the fully loaded all leather, black/black automatic with the bigger engine! The navigation system is really nice - huge screen and love the traffic reports! Dont lease this car - buy it -  because you wont want to give it back!"
cadillac,cts,2008,Rick, 02/24/2008,New CTS owner 2008,4,"I bought my 2008 CTS with 300 HP DI engine and I swear it feels like an 8 cylinder. The handling of this car is like a luxury-sports car, which is much better than the 2004 350 ZX I traded in. I've got just over 1200 miles on it and it is still as tight and responsive as the day I drove it off the lot. I talked my wife into this car and she is happy I did(it was her 350Z). I got every feature available."
cadillac,cts,2008,Roger, 02/25/2008,Caddie is Back!,5,"While the 08 CTS is not quite as precise as the BMW 3- or 5-series (I've owned both), it is more than adequate in everyday driving and gives you back a much quieter, smoother ride than either of the Bimmers. The interior of this car absolutely blows away the competition. Compare this car, well equipped for about $43k (AWD, 3.6 DI, Bose, and almost everything except Nav with a comparably equipped 3-series (about $49k) or 5-series (even more), and you'll begin to understand what all the press is about.  Fit, finish and materials are superb...and if GM can produce a reliable car (TBD), the Boys in Bavaria and elsewhere have a lot to be worried about.  Did I mention this car burns regular?"
cadillac,cts,2008,Shani Chainani, 09/01/2007,Caddy Gold,4,"The new CTS is a beast of a different kind.  The car is completely redesigned but maintains the characteristics of the legendary first generation.  The front view of the car is aggressive, low to the floor, and makes a statement before you arrive at your destination.  The interior is by far the best, even topping BMW and Mercedes brands (which we were considering).  The driving experience is stiff, responsive and very comfortable.  A simple tap to the right of the shifter sends the car into sport mode and all 304 horses awaken to tear up the asphalt.  Only one way to describe our experience thus far- Pure Gold."
cadillac,cts,2008,LaBorde, 09/14/2007,My 2008 CTS,4,"Replaced my 2005 STS with the CTS. CTS is more comfortable, more ""gadgets"", more fun to drive, turns more heads than my STS ever did."

Owned 2 BMW 530i's and a C280 Mercedes before that.  Happy to see that there's an American car that finally measures up. Is it perfect - no?  Probably the only car in its class not to have bluetooth, but OnStar is GM's baby so I can live with my bluetooth earpiece and use the OnStar when needed. What I am impressed with is the styling, performace, and functionality. Got the 3.6DI with 304 horses and its definitely quicker than the 530i. The audio with XM and 40GB hard drive and centerpoint surround sound is sweet. Escalade-like styling makes it. "

I have the 304 hp model with rear wheel dr. Fully loaded with the luxury package and navigation. The only thing this car is missing is blue tooth. there is zero road noise, you can only hear the engine at higher revs. "

When I bought my CTS  I researched and test drove all the major competitors (BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C Class, etc.) and the CTS beat them all in drive, HP, leg room (I'm 6' 2"" and have enough room to even sit in the back) and in looks. This is my first Caddy but won't be my last."
cadillac,cts,2008,LB, 10/03/2007,Foreign cars eat ur hearts out!,4,"This car rocks! It's the red one on TV and magazine covers; I got it fully featured, but opted for the Auto vs Manual shift. It replaced my '03 CTS that I loved (and so did my BMW-owning friends....more room!) I obliged my Mercedes and Audi loving relatives by considering them, but hands down this CTS packs more punch/value for every buck. I find it a smooother ride than the Europeans. It has more useful features than my cousin's limited edition Audi that cost $80K. He said he has no iPod connector nor USB port, nor 36 preset channels, nor as much room in the back seat for clients as I do. The teenagers in my neighborhood went crazy over it.  Talk about not being Dad's car anymore!"

First trip was to Ann Arbor for dinner last night, beautiful ride!  "
cadillac,cts,2008,Sirgeek, 09/27/2007,This CTS is amazing.,4,"I can't get over the features this car packs. The hard drive is fantastic.  The power and fuel economy together are both unbelievable.  I liked it for the exterior, but I love it for the interior. And it actually has good rear seat room. This is clearly Caddy's 5-series, but it feels more like a 3-series driving down the road (the curvier the better!)"
cadillac,cts,2008,CAC99, 09/29/2007,08 CTS,4,"Great car!  Most outstanding interior of any American car.  Exterior looks a little too flashy and front bumper is a little low, but still a classy looking car. Terrific build quality (way to go GM) and great driving characteristics.  Nice to see Cadillac come to market with new technology like great nav system, ""TiVO-like audio"" and voice command.  Disappointing to not see Bluetooth even offered - I bought on the promise that it will be retrofitted."
cadillac,cts,2008,B.Smith, 10/03/2007,This CTS has all the right ingredients,4,"I was considering the 3-series, 5- series, and Acura TL in addition to this vehicle. I'd have been happy with any of them I think, but the CTS had that extra bit. The technology was abundant and easy to use. The performance was amazing on twisty lake side roads. I've driven it about a 1000 miles so far on business trips and my customers gush over it and I sit in comfort the whole while. Get the air conditioned seats! I also appreciated the DFI engine over the standard and am getting about 28 mpg on the freeway. 20 mpg in town."
cadillac,cts,2008,Karen, 10/02/2007,I love this car!,4,"I've only had the car for 2 weeks, but it's been my dream car for years and I waited for the 2008s as I heard they were much improved.  I love this car more than I ever imagined I would.  It's quiet, comfortable, easy to drive and everyone stops to look at it.  The sunset blue color is really something to look at."
cadillac,cts,2008,ejmachad, 08/31/2007,Mac Daddy Pimp Mobile!,4,"I picked up the ride on Saturday afternoon and spent the rest of the day ""oohing and aahing"" and getting lots of looks from other drivers.   I went from a BMW 325 and was very surprised by how well the car handled. I  expected a big drop off in handling and there was none.  Oh, and this car moves. I had smooth power and plenty of torque. If you're not careful, you'll eclipse the speed limit quickly. All this with an extremely quiet interior. The interior is beautiful--especially at night! The ambient lighting absolutely makes a huge impression. I like the HID steerable headlamps and if I'm not mistaken the back up lamps are HID as well.  This is my first Caddy and I'm in love! "
cadillac,cts,2008,joe2306, 09/08/2007,2008 Cadillac CTS is fantastic!,5,"I have now had my 2008 CTS for about 10 days. I took delivery of a black with black leather with the 304 horsepower engine and all wheel drive that also has the 18 inch wheel package with all season tires and the upgraded suspension, etc. I also have the premium luxury collection (PDQ) that includes almost every option available on the car.  For background, I have owned the Lexus 400 series, the BMW 7 series, the BMW 5 series, the Audi A6 4.2, the Audi A8 and a number of other similar cars. This car is every bit as nice, particularly when you compare the price  This car is fantastic. It is beautiful inside and out and the stereo and nav functions are great and easy to use. Go see it!"

cadillac,cts,2008,Michael Lyon, 09/22/2007,08 CTS Absolutely Tremendous!,5,"This car just rode from Miami Beach to St. Augustine Florida, directly after pickup from the dealer. The straight line handling compares to train rails, almost unbelievable engineering from Cadillac/GM. We hated getting out of the car after 5 hours!  Total joy, as you will swear your driving a V-8.

cadillac,cts,2008,Concord Caddy, 09/24/2007,New AWD CTS is a winner,5,"My 2004 CTS lease was up and I was contemplating a SRX for the reliability in the snow. I decided to drive the 2008 CTS-4 and was amazed at the improvements. Both interior and exterior this is a superior car to the 2004-07 versions. Even though I got the standard engine, it still has more muscle than what my 2004 had. I was really thinking SUV, but once I drove the CTS it was a no-brainer. I like everything about it, the cabin looks like a fighter jet cockpit, the controls are easy to navigate, and find. The body is rounder and has a more muscle car look to it versus the boxy earlier versions. Be careful! If you drive it, you may not be able to resist getting it."
cadillac,cts,2008,Steve , 09/29/2007,GM Gets it right,5,"Went to buy an STS but settled on the CTS instead.  Love the sunroof with sunshade. The performance, economy, and handling are unbelievable in this car. Transmission very smooth. Got 26 miles to the gallon on first tank. Form and fit and interior design are way ahead of the competition. Thanks GM.  Traded a 2005 SRX.  "

Stopped in to get the payoff on our Hummer trade-in.  A black CTS in the showroom had (afater market) 20"" chrome wheels and a feature set at least $6 - $10K better than Lexus and BMW. Just to be thorough, we drove it.  Amazing ride. Stunning. I'm still smiling. Everything everybody is saying.  I just kept thinking, ""This is a Caddy?"" I couldn't beleive it. Only several days later, but I'm still giddy. I love this car. Fast, smooth, quiet, responsive, corners on rails. There isn't enough room in this review space.  Trust me:  drive this car! "

The 2008 CTS is far superior in quality, performance, and handling. That's right, the 2008 Cadillac CTS walked all over the Avalon for quality  Three out of four Avalons I considered had very noticeable interior fit-and-trim problems. While the Avalon was very capable and pleasant to drive, there wasn't anything outstanding about the vehicle. On the other hand,  the CTS provided me with an instant ""WOW"" experience in the road. This vehicle is fun to drive and the handling and suspension is outstanding."

I would say in my experience this is one of the best cars I've driven for the money. Great performance and handling, easy to use features, feels  luxury unlike in my opinon the previous CTS. An awesome ride."
cadillac,cts,2008,brown343, 10/22/2007,Maybe expectations were too high,4,"Came off a lease of an Audi A4. The CTS was a new design for 08, which was appealing. Seriously considered the BMW 335xi also. Having more rear leg room and supporting an American company were the deciding factors. However, build quality of my A4 was much better than the CTS. Have already had the CTS in for steering (wheel shakes) and navigation problems.  Spending 4 hours at the dealership with a two week-old $48,000 vehicle is quite discouraging. Steering feels ""disconnected"" from car at times, especially during aggressive driving.  Fuel-injectors make a noticeable, annoying hum. Thanks go to a great stereo to mask this. Upon close inspection, my black paint has factory flaws."
cadillac,cts,2008,PittDriver, 10/21/2007,My 3rd CTS,4,"Leased an '03 and then an '05. The new '08 improves on every aspect of the CTS both the good and the not so good. Huge improvements in the interior. Ride, suspension, handling all even better than before, and the handling was already great. I'm delighted to see GM's initial success in design mature so well. Growing up, I loved Caddies so it's satisfying to be driving one as a grown up. (Brings out the teen in me when I'm behind the wheel.) My CTS is, without any exceptions or explanations, every bit as good or better than what Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and Infiniti can turn out for the money. That's improtant to me, since it would be great to keep driving cars like this made by GM."
cadillac,cts,2008,anselmoc5, 10/25/2007,Red Hot 2008 CTS4,5,We bought this loaded 2008 CTS to replace our base model 2004 CTS.  What a huge step up! Ours is exactly like the Crystal Red CTS4 seen in all of the ads. This car draws a great deal of attention when we are out in it. An 800 mile road trip in the first week of ownership proved to be a most pleasurable drive. The car handles like a sports cars and the 304 HP V6 sure feels like a V8.  The ride is Cadillac quality but with a nice sporty road feedback.  All of the chatter about the sunroof letting in too much light proved to be a non- issue.  Even with the light Cashmere interior the sun shade blocked out the sun's rays just fine. This is a truely great car to own! 
cadillac,cts,2008,Caddy gone perfect!, 10/25/2007,This ain't your daddy's caddy,5,"Be prepared to be impressed - from putting on some of Cadillac's color options - to the extensive standard equipment, all are better on this car. If the same level of attention paid in planning then building this car can be transfered to others in the GM Family - watch out world for market share will return back to the USA! "
cadillac,cts,2008,Mike, 11/09/2007,Wow,4,"Waited  7 weeks and 1 day for cars arrival after factory order.  Even though I had seen hundreds of photos in magazines and television ads, I was stunned by the car's beauty and design in person.  And this is from a guy that owns an 07 MB S550 and 06 MB CLS500. The White Diamond paint is outstanding as is the build quality. The interior is excellent as well. I can't imagine anyone not being pleased with this vehicle.  I got on the freeway and opened it up a bit and was very happy with the response and smoothness of the egine and transmission.  Kudos to General Motors."
cadillac,cts,2008,randvlip, 11/13/2007,Back to American,4,"Once was a true blue American car buyer. During a period with no contract, I sold Toyotas and bought into the foreign car hype. However, something about the engines never gave me the feel of muscle in the engines of an American. This car has the get up and go I grew up with, yet the luxury I've grown to expect. I have the 304 DI with the Performance package which combined really gives a superior driving experience. And oh, BTW Sunset Blue has chameleon characteristics that may make you not recognize your car depending on the time of day and/or the light it's in. I love it."
cadillac,cts,2008,Christoph Capzi, 11/09/2007,CTS 08 Gorgeous!,5,Suspension on this car might be the best I have ever driven.    The balance between handling and overall comfortable ride is spectacular. MPG has surprised as well with 22 combined!

However, my dealer called me when the 2008 came in and insisted I drive it.  Needless to say I feel in love and I couldn't pass up the deal.  GM finally blew me away with this car and kept me as a customer.  Purchased a fully loaded Crystal Red with the 3.6 Direct Inject engine.

cadillac,cts,2008,Todd K., 11/18/2007,Finally a true American sports sedan,4,"I've had my '08 CTS for about a month now, and the commercials are spot on - this car turns me on every time I fire it up.  It's a real head turner, and I've gotten more looks and thumbs ups than with any other car. Mine has the 6 speed w/ DI engine, and most every option available. I say most options because one that I really wanted - AWD, was not available with the stick.  I test drove the G35X, BMW 335iX, Audi A4 Quattro and finally the CTS and it was love at first sight. The CTS is really that good, and a bit bigger than the others. I really wanted AWD and I might have a different opinion after the snow falls, but I'm planning in investing in a decent set of snow tires.  We'll see.."
cadillac,cts,2008,08 CTS - well done !, 11/26/2007,08 CTS - new standard for the world,5,"My 2005 CTS was a step up from my two previous STS Caddies. Build quality was excellent and I experienced only minor repairs over 35,000 miles. It still is a real ""looker"".  But my new loaded Crystal Red 08 CTS is about the most perfect car I have ever had. It blows away just about every BMW, Audi and Mercedes on the road today. It is stunningly beautiful, excellent fit and finish, with options galore and the handling is remarkable. The styling and performance improvements in the 08 are obvious, but it is the subtle nuances and thoughful engineering that make the car a standout for me. I can't tell a Lexus from a Camry until up close, but there's no mistaking this Caddy at any distance !"
cadillac,cts,2008,Jim G, 11/28/2007,2008 CTS DI,4,Great vehicle to drive. A bit heavy but it feels good once it gets rolling... AWD takes a bit of performance away. I swear my 2007 (non-DI is quicker and faster) But a truly great car. Love the entire redesign. 
cadillac,cts,2008,DanV, 11/20/2007,First American car in awhile,4,"Haven't owned an American car in years, but after reading reviews, decided to give it a try. My previous car was an '06 Audi A6.  Very impressed with this new Cadillac...the CTS has an amazing ride-handling combination, great power with the DI engine, and awesome looks. The perceived quality is on par (if not better) with the top German and Japanese offerings. Time will tell about long term reliability."

Traded my 2005 Audi A6 which I liked but got too frustrated with Audi because they Claimed the noises in my car from the heating vents were ""characteristic"" of the car and there was nothing they would do about it.

cadillac,cts,2008,OttawaUser, 12/05/2007,Lots to like,4,"My CTS has the FE3 suspension and the 304 hp direct injection engine.  Performance: I like to drive quickly. Power, tracking, grip and dynamics are all excellent. Performance brakes are really powerful (but touchy at low speeds), and also necessate 18"" wheels for snow tires - 17"" won't fit. In sport mode the auto transmission matches speeds perfectly, a bit less smooth in regular mode.  Interior is put together really well. Feels much roomier than G35. Seats very good. Controls very well thought out. Stereo with 40 GB HDD is truely awesome. My only quibble - needs more storage bins in front and a place for sunglasses.  Overall I love it and find myself  looking for excuses to drive."

There is a noise in the instrument panel (sounds like a fan running all the time) they say it is normal (the other 4 didn't have it!!!)

cadillac,cts,2008,HTaylor, 05/22/2019,Exceptionally Reliable Vehicle,5,"I purchased my 08 CTS two years ago when my 04 CTS (that was previously run in the ground by the previous owner) cost me $4k to repair and still wasn't right.  I reluctantly looked at another CTS mainly because the reviews had it rated higher than every over Cadillac model car out there and since I'm 6'3"" 290 pounds the Caddy is really generous with Driver legroom.  I have had zero issues (mechanical or otherwise) with the car since purchase.  No warning lights, squeaky sounds, falling apart interior, nothing.  I must admit that the car came from a previous older couple that treated it like the queen she is.  It had 69k on it when purchased and it's sitting at 90k now.  It's very response (especially when put in manual mode).  It's much quieter than any of my other vehicles (little to no road noise).  Everything is tightly together and works properly.  Not sure how the sunroof and windows were able to withstand two major hailstorms that totally destroyed hundreds of other vehicles here in Colorado Springs in Summer of 2018 but even with some dents and dings on the body I still can't bring myself to risk giving up such a stellar performer.  Cadillac got it right with this one!!!

cadillac,cts,2008,Vini, 12/22/2019,Nothin's lackin' when you're cadillacin',5,"I bought mine in 2014 with 130000km on it. I'm still driving it in 2019 with 241000km now.
My TCS, abs, and scs have been disable due to a sensor in the front hub that has failed. You have to replace the whole hub/bearing assembly to fix it. I fixed the passenger side because of this when I first got it... But it's been years since the driver side went... And I don't really care if any of that stuff works really. I've had to change a headlight. It was a pain because you have to take off the bumper to do it. But oh well I can handle that. It uses about 1/2L of oil in between oil changes which no problem. All's I've had to do was the brakes. Which cost me $400 because I could do them myself. The engine light has been on for a long time now... Probably the cam or crank position sensor. But it starts every time... Sometimes it struggles... But it starts. All in all I've had a great experience with the CTS. The interior is still clean and has zero wear or rips anywhere. Very high quality. Being 11 years old now but it still looks modern. The body styling was far beyond its time. It does not look dated at all. Zero rust. I would recommend this car for sure. It owes me nothing and I'm sure it still has another 100000km in her.

cadillac,cts,2009,Greg, 03/10/2016,Great Car for the Price,4,"I purchased my 2009 CTS in 2013 with 69,000 miles on it at the time.  I drive the car daily (40 miles or so), cross country twice (2000+ miles each time), and frequently on road trips of 200 miles or more.  It handles well on the highway and the ride is smooth.  Cabin is spacious and quiet for an older vehicle, and comfortably seats me and three others.  I have not had any problems with the car mechanically though I frequently ride it hard and put it away wet.  Since it hit 75,000 miles I've been changing the oil every 7,000 miles and using nothing but Valvoline High Mileage Full Synthetic.  The engine is powerful and it will outrun most sedans on the road, both 0-60 and in top speed... believe me, I've done it.  The only electrical issue the car had was in the headlight wiring harness, which had a plug rust out due to a leak in the passenger side headlight.  I attempted replacing the headlights first, believing the issue was in the passenger side light itself, but when both stock and aftermarket replacements (don't ever buy them, they are terrible and not nearly as bright as stock) continued to have issues, I tracked the problem to the harness.  $114.00 was the total cost and it took me about an hour and a half to install (I know very little about this kind of stuff).  Not bad if you ask me.  The car now has 114,556 on it and still runs, shifts, and takes the corners like it did when I first got it.   I live off a pretty windy road, and at night when traffic is non-existent, I enjoy taking the ""20 MPH MAX"" corners at 60+.  This car sticks around the bends and makes me confident enough to sling it back and forth with ease.  Only other change I made was the addition of 4 new tires (cost $800) at 100,000 miles (still had factory rubber up until then) and wiper blades every 2 years or so.  As of right now factory breaks still pass state inspection, as does everything else.  I am very satisfied with how this car drives.  I only wish it had a few more features on it, but it's a base model so I digress.  Total cost in 2013 for the car was $19,995, and I've put probably less than $1500 into it in my time owning it.  I'm happy with that.  One last thing.  Was at a dead stop and got rear ended by a Camry traveling in excess of 40 MPH.  I drove away from that scene with nothing but moderate rear end damage, and a bent exhaust pipe (his insurance paid $7,400 for complete repairs including an entire new exhaust system, rear bumper, trunk lid, and tail lights).  The Camry's engine was literally sitting on the ground.  Sorry fellas, but American steel still beats Japanese plastic.

My advice, sell the car quickly and never buy another one. That is exactly my next move. I have had this car five years and thought after I paid it off it would last another five years. WRONG! Can't afford the repairs and hoping I can get rid of it. Just had to replace timing chain at 160000---surprised I even had to do this at all. Too much money invested I just have to keep driving and hope it last long enough without another major repair. Still unhappy with car. I will never buy another American made car.

cadillac,cts,2009,Craig, 05/12/2016,"Great Car to Own, But distructive side air bags!",5,"We loved this car and it and would recommend owning it to others. It is a great feeling, handling and looking car. The fuel economy and value far exceed expectations.  BUT if your side airbags deploy like ours did when a pair of deer ran into the side of the car, the interior of the vehicle virtually self-distructs in a live saving role and totals the vehicle interior with 5K to 6 K in damage plus labor including locking down the seat and seat belts, and that is without deployment of front airbags. 
The side impact we recieved left the car both driveable and the doors openable but dented and knocked out the front head light. But the side air bag deployment essentially made a case for Total Loss in insurance on vehicle with no frame, engine, electrical, power train or other auto body damage.  3500 in exterior parts and labor to fix the exterior but 12,500 in damage from the side airbags deploying.

I sold the Scion tc and purchased a used 2009 Cadillac CTS with all factory options at 75k miles.  The vehicle seemed well maintained inside, out, and mechanically.  I had purchased it from a reputable BMW dealership for $18k.  Here are the things that have gone wrong with the car.

This car was a HUGE disappointment, being it was my first luxury vehicle.  Granted I bought it with 75k, i made sure full tune up was performed along with all the fluids changed (transmission, differential, transfer case, coolant) when i first purchased the vehicle.  Things have failed on this car that do not fail on reliable manufactures.   I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GM VEHICLE EVER AGAIN.  ESPECIALLY A CADILLAC.  Next vehicle will be a Lexus, or even hate to say the new Genesis or Equus look good and have good reliability ratings.  Too bad I really wanted to support an American brand.   My car was service at Englewood Cadillac in NJ and Brogan Cadillac in Totowa, NJ.   They know me by first name at both places because my car has been in there so much, along with other customers I tend to see every now and again.  Lots of problems, everyone i know with a used Cadillac has a horrible experience with them.  SO DISSATISFIED WITH THIS CAR, PLEASE DO NOT BUY ONE.

cadillac,cts,2009,Sad CTS Owner, 12/05/2009,Dream Car Nightmare,3,"I am so disappointed with my car that I can hardly stand to drive it and am considering simply not paying for it anymore. I spent months reviewing the car and even got advice from a coworker who has the car and is a GM family member.  It has been one issue after another and is constantly at the dealership.  I finally had to go to GM and threaten to stop paying for it to get their attention. After repeated trips to service, I had to use my phone to film a problem that I still have with the stereo sound not powering up. The front end shakes and is out of alignment again, it idles to high and the transmission feels rough and can be felt in the gear shifter. Dealer service quality is very poor."
cadillac,cts,2009,BlockDaddy21, 07/27/2009,Lives Up to the Hype,4,"With the automotive world giving such panegyrical reviews to this car, I figured it surely must be a ploy to get us to stimulate the economy and buy American. Prior to my '09 CTS, I owned a 2008 Acura TL Type-S that was my absolute favorite car. However, I drove the CTS, and it was all over. My 3.6 DI AWD is a real driver's car; it gives great feedback to the driver, corners like it's on rails, the brakes are phenomenal, and it has admirable throttle response. Not to mention great style!  Overall build quality is great - no complaints in the first 7000 miles.  I would recommend that anyone in the market check out the CTS among the typical mix of imports - you'll be pleasantly surprised."

The driving experience was great, with the FE3 sports suspension, +300hp direct injection engine, and with it's 18inch wheels. The turning radius was real tight! I could not pass up on the price. With my trade in, a $42,000 car for less than $29K!

It was a great car until 73k miles when there was some “missing” in the engine when going up hills at about 52 mph.  The car went into a Cadillac dealer and what was thought to be a plugged fuel injector.  After 4 returned visits the dealer decides a piston needed to be replaced! WHAT!  It was over $2,000.00 for that visit for major engine issue to a vehicle with relatively low miles.
Fast forward to 78k miles without any issues, no warning, leakages or dash lights while driving highway speed there is a sudden screeching scream and thumping coming from the car.  I immediately pulled over to the shoulder and put it in park which would not stop the car from rolling.  The car had to be towed to the Cadillac dealer which they determined a few days later the transmission has totally gone out on it.  Their explanation was it was caused to “mechanical failure”.  The Cadillac dealer nor GM would back up their product.  The dealer offered to take it as a trade for a new Cadillac, no way.  
Several thousand dollars later, the transmission was rebuilt at my expense.  Two weeks after getting the car back with a rebuilt trans the throttle went out ($600).  A few months later the tracing sensor went out.  After that was replaced the car started leaking radiator fluid and need 2 water pumps replaced at the tune of almost $1,000.  This was enough within a few months and less than 80k miles on the vehicle.
I recently traded the CTS in on a brand-new foreign made vehicle not a GM product.  GM did not back up their product and have not earned my business.
For the price and the Cadillac name, I expected more.

I wanted one since I was a little boy. This car has been a nightmare, repair after repair, and never runs without a check engine light coming on after a few miles. The fuel pump melted pouring gasoline over the exhaust, luckily we weren't killed, they recalled all model years up to 2008, I have the 2009, so even though the part used was the same, no coverage, $1600 out of pocket. The exhaust system fell off twice, battery died multiple times, brakes went out, seats and electronics all went bad after the repeated leaks from wherever, 4 inches of water on floor in back seat, trunk with a foot of water, and dashboard where computers and electronics are housed lots like a waterfall when it rains...car is totaled, mold ,mildew, just a mess. The folks at GM do nothing for you, and the dealer could care less, actually offers to sell me another Cadillac, as if that is doing me a favor...Hudgins Chevrolet Cadillac in Williamsburg, Virginia, stay away from them, they don't care. This car was a lemon, never again with a GM product.

cadillac,cts,2009,Shannon Hayes, 07/30/2018,Plan on spending $$$$ in repairs,1,"I was asked to update my review. Nothing has really changed. The CTS model has huge problems with the stablilizing track system.  It just doesn't turn off the system, you LOSE power to the transmission.  Pulling out into traffic can end with your car being t-boned, and this is without any notice.  Getting it repaired took 4 separate attempts. The bill would have been over $2000 had I not had the foresight to purchase a warranty (Cadillac Dealer Mechanic actually never made it out of there driveway.

The only thing I have done to it is oil changes and one set of tires at 74,000. I love this ride, can't get over this car, runs strong, and looks great. Love the black ice paint !!

The road holding, acceleration and ride are on par with many sport sedans. The all wheel drive works flawlessly in snow, rain, etc. The drivers handle failed (antenna would not respond to the transmitter) last month and had to be replaced. The optional blue tint coat paint gets rave reviews where ever I go. The gas mileage averages 20.5 (80% road, 20% city)."

I never thought about it at the time of purchase but I do now! I paid almost $40,000 for this car and at 15,500 miles the plastic upholstery on the drivers seat is already starting to stretch and fray. I'm not a big person at 165 lb. So it's not my size thats the problem its the cheap plastic crap they used for the seat covering. Not a bit of leather on these seats at all. What ever you do don't settle for anything less than leather. Remember Cadillac guarantee doesn't cover your upholstery.

This vehicle was the best value from a features & performance per dollar standpoint. The BMW's had a slight edge on drive experience and handling, but not enough to warrant the higher price and sacrifice on all other features. The technology inside the CTS is incredible, with only a few annoying exceptions (see below). I am very happy with this car and look forward to driving it every day. It has great curb appeal and is a vehicle that makes you feel great when driving it. If you like music, then you'll esp love it.

The 09 CTS is a nice car, looks very nice from the outside, has a respectable interior also. I wish I took a closer look at the Audi, BMW, and possibly the infiniti. My mom has a G37 which is a nicer car in my opinion. The CTS does have the image of being expensive if that is important to you. The car is very heavy but despite its weight, it is very nimble. I feel it could have a few more horses but it can pick up speed pretty well. The Gas mileage is horrible but it does take the 87 octane which is nice. That is a perk that other cars in this luxury category don't have. "

The DI engine either just doesn't like sub zero temps or is plain tempermental, but on occasion, I've had trouble firing this baby up.  Having said that, the AWD is awesome. This car handles better on slick roads than my V8 suv.  It looks great and is overall pretty cool.  The most annoying thing for me is the telescoping steering wheel.  It is quite bulky so that my knees constantly bang into it, and I'm an average to small guy.  But, she's a head turner and the Black Cherry color is awesome."

I encountered every conceivable weather condition except snow --sunshine, rain, and even hail; high buffeting winds and still air; temperatures from the 40's to the 90's. Indianapolis is 500 feet above sea level.  Vail pass is 10,200 feet. I kept the cruise at 77/78, except in Colorado, where I found it easier to drive with the cruise off. The car is so smooth, quiet, and comfortable that I frequently found myself doing 90 when I was not using the cruise. The A/C was flawless in the 90 degree sun, and the cooled seats were wonderful. The drive was almost like playing a video game from my easy chair. I got 26.3 mpg going west and 27.1 returning east."

I love the stitching of the leather seats, and the sepele wood accents make all the difference in terms of lux factor. I wish I would have upped to the nav system/upgraded stereo however. The double wide sun roof is great for the people in the back as well. It really makes all the difference in a car purchase when you can walk up to your car and smile every time.

You give up nothing at all, and the car is significantly less expensive than its rivals.  Fit/finish, ride, handling, power, comfort and features are all 1st rate.  Unlike some of the imports, this car fits both taller drivers (I'm 6'5"") and shorter drivers (my wife is 5'3"") very comfortably. It's really quiet on the road - no wind noise, squeaks, or rattles. The DI engine is responsive, powerful, and runs on regular gas. I frequently get comments from friends and co-workers: ""You bought a what?!?""

She drives 120 miles round trip to and from work,  and this Cadillac fit the bill,  with more luxury than we were expecting from a car costing $40 grand. We got the car with the Premium Luxury Collection, and my wife just loves the heated and cooled seats, the interior is as good as those cars costing twenty thousand dollars more. This car handles as good as any BMW or Lexus. The feel of the ride is almost as good as those high end luxury cars but just a bit hard with the sport pkg and 18 inch wheels, but not enough to make me look at any other make. Very good car."

I traded in my 6 year old S-Type Jag for the CTS. Electronics have sure come a long way since the Jag was new. Now I have all the toys in a solid, powerful, beautiful, and moderately priced American vehicle that I can have serviced anywhere.

The CTS with the Direct Injection, Performance Package, and AWD was the best car for the money and the combination of features.  The Caddy has more room and a better interior than even the German cars, which surprised me since I grew up with Audi.  The hopped up CTS is NOT AN OLD MANS AUTOMOBILE!  "

That said, there are still some quality issues they need to address.  There were some paint issues (underspray), a shaky side mirror, and creaks.  Nothing too bad but these things should not take place on any car of this class.  I would tell anyone to check out CTS before buying an import.  This car has it all."
cadillac,cts,2009,Jerry Schofield, 08/19/2009,Transmission Failure - Unhappy Owner,3,"Expect this from your dealer and cadillac. If your automatic tranny fails like ours, cadillac will have you wait two weeks for the parts and a failed attempt to rebuild your transmission at least twice before they deem it appropriate to replace the transmission. Our new CTS spent 20 days of the first 29 days of ownership in the shop. As a ""valued"" Cadillac owner you'll spend dollars for nickel and dime service. The new ""GM"" is just as bad as the old ""GM"" or worse. No matter how great the car looks or drives, you won't enjoy ownership if you're treated like this.

Great look & feel inside & out, superior driving experience (even with base 3.6 engine).   Bold exterior design and black cherry color has drawn lots of compliments.  Mileage is about as expected, 17-19 mpg in mostly city driving.  Seems pretty good to me for an AWD car.  Like one other reviewer, I had major transmission problem about 3 mos into ownership, which eventually required total replacement and about 2 wks in the dealership.  However, dealer handled great, provided free loaner CTS for the entire time, so what's to complain about?  No problems since.  Overall a great vehicle and certainly the best car I've ever owned."
cadillac,cts,2009,USA-1 , 03/26/2020,Enjoying this car.,5,"I was given this car as a ""loaner"" from a dealership and was sold after the first mile.

Bought this used in 2017 and the vehicle had 78K.

3.6 DI with all options.
Bose and XM sat radio awesome
Heated and cooled seats awesome
Cornering and handling. Stays flat in corners awesome
Performance takes off and passes with ease.
Cabin is quiet and clean.

Original tires. Black paint in good shape.

I think one needs to be careful in selecting a used car. A car driven hard for 20K miles may have a lot more problems then a well maintained easily driven car with a lot more miles.

Problems: Bluetooth will not play music from my phone. But will allow phone calls. Needed a battery. Sunroof is a little noisy.  2009 computer is lags. That is all folks.

Not my daily driver. still has original tires Ha! I keep it shiny.

Amazing that this car gets a lot of attention as folks think it is worth a lot more than it is.

The problem has progressed and we are headed back to the dealer again. The radio/NAV went out after 15,000 miles and brakes were replaced after a recall.

AWD glues the car to the road, yet provides a comfortable ride without sacrificing feel for the road. And, it's a head turner to be sure. Not a creak, squeak or rattle - this car is tight! My previous car was a Lexus ES330 and before that an Acura TL. Before buying I test drove Acura, Lexus and BMW's. The CTS is by far and away the best vehicle in it's class!

When I was looking for a new ride I tried them all. To be fair, I looked at all AWD cars similarly equipped. So, in searching, I found: IS250 (no guts-204HP, no glory). G35X, too much $$$ when you add the Sport pkg, wasn't impressed much except for the exhaust note. M-B C300-4Matic, too much $$, period! BMW 3or5 X anything, ditto. One minute behind the wheel of the CTS, the choice was clear. Motor Trend Car of the Year, need I say more?

The car is very sporty too. I get lots of compliments on it. The car doesn't need premium gas which is a huge plus. The voice activated command is nice and works well. Besides my 2005 Corvette, this is the first domestic car I've purchased in over 20 years. I have high expectations for my CTS and have not been disappointed."
cadillac,cts,2009,traderj, 10/15/2008,Very Happy,4,"Made an unbelievable deal for the base model with GMS pricing (which is still available on the '09 base model), Lease Loyalty Cash, Bonus Cash (for paying cash), Rebates and GM Card rewards. Paid only 64% of MSRP. This is an attractive car inside and out. It is enjoyable to drive. A solid, but not harsh, ride. I am 5'10 165 lbs. and I think the seats are very comfortable.  I could see where someone larger than me would think that the seats might be too narrow. Also rear headroom is limited to 6' adults. Rear visibility is very limited. This is my biggest knock against this car. But many cars I test drove had this same problem. Overall very happy!'"

Absolutely love this vehicle running on regular gasoline!"
cadillac,cts,2009,MK, 11/09/2008,Competing with the Germans!,4,"I have owned many many cars, mostly German and some Japanese luxury brands, this CTS is my first US luxury sedan in 25 years! It certainly competes well with all those brands, but with all the incentives and employee pricing, value ratio was the best of them all. In fact, I traded in my 2008 BMW 335i twin-turbo coupe shortly after for another car!"
cadillac,cts,2009,gunorthopod, 11/16/2008,At last!,4,"At last, a car that meets and exceeds all my expectations. Previous car was a 2007 Mercedes CLS 550. Thirty nine days in the shop the first 14 months. Problems with faulty navigation, multiple creaks, rattles, and vibrations, AC blower motor defective, and catastrophic power failure twice. Transmission needed to be replaced.I engineered a lemon law buyback fortunately. I looked at Lexus and BMW but was enthralled by the CTS. What a car! Perfect fit and finish with more advanced electronics than MB. Everything works as described. More than adequate power with superlative handling and acceleration. The only thing I gave up was a one half second 0 to 60 time. GM and Cadillac have produced a world class car.  "
cadillac,cts,2009,cts fan, 12/13/2008,First American car ever in 16 years,4,"I have had Toyota, Honda, Honda, Mini, Scion, VW and Honda.  This is my first upgrade into the luxury category and I was thinking of a Lexus until I drove my new CTS. This car has it all.  Looks, design, comfort, fun factor, reliability and safety.  And did I mention looks!. I absolutely love it so far. It is just amazing."
cadillac,cts,2009,kwbaron, 12/20/2008,GM's hard at work,5,"These are concerns expressed on this blog that no longer exist in this vehicle. Flash to pass is on this vehicle and it works with the HID high beams, I believe an industry first.  Bluetooth is standard.  It is now impossible to step on the brake and gas pedal at the same time. There is a single address book for the Bluetooth, navigation and OnStar systems. I compaired this vehicle to a Infinity 37x, Acura TL, and Lexus GS 350.  All are excellent vehicles. Only the CTS DI AWD has the interior luxury of the Lexus (done in the distinctly GM style), the performance and efficiency of the direct injection engine (it runs on regular gas) and handling characterics of a European sedan."
cadillac,cts,2009,Jacques T, 12/27/2008,22 Year Old Son Gone Nuts Over My CTS!,5,"Need we say more.  First time ever my son showing off our Caddy!  Quiet and quick acceleration,  pretty impressive! My God how come the CEO's are begging Washington for the money?  This car is real good for us. Would not surprise me if this car saves GM alone.  Zero complaints."
cadillac,cts,2009,steve, 03/14/2009,Thrilled!,5,"This vehicle is simply phenomenal. All the bells and whistles except ventilated seats. Pop up nav is truly my favorite feature.

Had to take the CTS4 out for a spin when took my lease back...wow.  Plenty of quiet performance, I mean quiet.  NE Ohio potholes no match.  BMW better performer but not for the added dollars,  Lexus no curb appeal,  Infiniti more bells and whistles,  Audi my back still hurts.  Glad I had to return the lease to a Caddy dealership."

cadillac,cts,2009,Caddy style!!, 04/05/2009,Caddy style!!!,5,"Great car! I owned a 2003 CTS and this one is night and day! Test drove G37S, Audi A5, and Jaguar XF. This car compares to all except G37S which was fast and fun but rough ride. The Audi and Jaguar were overpriced compared to the CTS and features offered. The only thing that bothered me on test drives was the cooled seats (back hurt). Bought car without cooled seats. Other then this I love the car - cool look and great ride! Very good price for the features and quality provided. Also 0% finance and fantastic rebates you can't pass up."
cadillac,cts,2009,Phil Grisham, 04/22/2009,GM got this one right!,5,"At a time when so many new cars all look alike, this vehicle is truly distinctive in design inside and out.  This car handles like a dream.  Build quality is great.  My average mileage is 23 mpg and on the road at legal-plus speed it is 28 mpg. A little more punch would be nice.  I am considering a performance chip if I can find one.  I had a problem with the radio coming on all by itself!  It took a few phone call and a few months, but it was corrected.  On a wet rutted road water splashing under the car on the left side makes a lot of noise.  "

The key's are always in the vehicles so you get to really check out the vehicles without some salesman pressuring you. I'm so tired of seeing on the internet about how American cars use cheap plastic (I have yet to see a car that uses any other type) I have been in Audi's, Bmw's, Mercedes, etc and I will tell you that it's allot of bull. Being spread around about American Interiors and reliability. I think Cadillac hit it ""outta here"" as the late great Harry Kalas (Phillies announcer) would say.   "

My grandson wanted me to get the Cts V but im 70 i dont need that. This has plenty of get up and go. I got it fully loaded for 51,000. It has all the luxury's. MY wife loves it and wants to keep it forever. The heated cooled seats are great. {Cooled is loud on high setting} Love the dual sunroof. Pop up nav screen is a must. All of our music sounds great on this car. A few things I dont like on this car is head room in the back. Storage is nill for cell phone and wallets. There is ALOT of road noise but you get used to it. My grandson is getting a car in a year he likes mine but still is getting the XLR"

This car was in the shop more than it was in my driveway... from rattles and squeaks to engine lights and a replaced transmission... the car looks great - but build quality is very poor.  And GM/Cadillac apologized but were unwilling to step up and make it right (I repeatedly requested a replacement vehicle and I didn't want to go through the lemon law - nor should I have had to with this ""flagship"" product).  I wanted to buy a GM with this purchase to help the cause... but they did nothing to reward my loyalty.  Very disappointing all around.  The car did look good while I had it! "

cadillac,cts,2009,Jim P, 06/17/2009,HUGE Disappointment,1,"First it was a harmonic imbalance that was so bad it caused me to be nauseous when I drove the vehicle. This took months to correct. Then it was a rattle in the drivers sun visor and it needed to be ordered and replaced. Then it was seriously squealing brakes that need to be replaced with about 10,000 miles on the car. Then it was a rattle so bad in the rear it sounded like to roof was falling at times. And still I have the rattle in the dash area that is so annoying I actually hate driving my car. Driving a new car at the price point of +$40k should be a WONDERFUL experience.  This car is pure JUNK! No wonder your going belly up! You deserve it."

I tired of my 04 Lexus with a terrible tranny problem that they wouldnt adddress. It had zero performance. I was missing my 1972 GTO! i bought the CTS 3 weeks ago and i love it! I would put the quality up against any of the foreign manufacturers. I have the thundergrey and had people come uo to me in parking lots and say""wow, what kind of car is that""? GM has hit a home run with this line. "
cadillac,cts,2009,Travis Rogers, 07/01/2009,Satisfied . . . mostly!,4,"I love everything about the car except for the gas mileage which isn't any better than the 2000 Sedan De ville I traded in for it.  The storage spaces (doors, glove box, center console, trunk, etc.) are also quite small for the size of car.  I got the blue diamond tricoat which is absolutely beautiful.  The On-Star and cell phone service is cool and the stereo system is awesome.  It handles beautifully and has plenty of smooth power!"
cadillac,cts,2009,John C., 07/03/2009,The Best Choice for an All Around Sedan,5,"My prior two cars were 2002 & 2006 Lexus LS-430 sedans. I established a decision criteria to keep it objective. I checked out Lexus LS/GS, Mercedes E, Jaguar XF, Infinity M, BMW 3/5, Lincoln MKS, Geneses, Audi4/6 & Acura TL. In the end, the BMW 535 and the Cadillac CTS stood out. We also own a BMW (& 4 before it).  The ride/handling was about the same. Styling was aggressive versus classic. Seating was similar. Cost over three years was insignificant. The difference was the way the cars are actually equipped.  BMW offers most of the same options, but they are not reasonably available. Ease of use was also big factor.  Even my BMW driving wife agreed, the CTS was the best total choice."

I did look at the foreign models, but the only thing that stood out for me was BMW. I have owned GM before and have been overall impressed with their designs and comfort. What originally lured me in was the promise of excellence in design and my parents being Cadillac owners, but I was sold at first test drive.  Love the car, love everything about it!! I'm afraid that between the customer service from Corporate Cadillac and the quality of the vehicle, I am now a Cadillac owner for life!  Oh...FYI... I have read reviews about road noise... three words: sport-tuned- suspension... go back to that Lexus if you don't like it!"
cadillac,cts,2009,Ltdc, 08/08/2009,My first Cadillac,4,I must say that so far it has been a mostly pleasant experience. I have the red CTS and it does draw it share of raves from family and strangers. One draw back I noticed immediately was the width of the A pillars in conjunction with the side view mirrors makes for a sizable blind spot. Backing the car up is a bit of a guessing game since you can't see the rear deck. You can't count on the computer to give accurate gas mileage readings. On the instant readout the mileage jumps all over the place including into the 40 + mpg range. The average MPG was showing 30.2 at 65 MPH without the AC on. If it was really getting that kind of mileage I think it would have been show on the EPA estimate. 
cadillac,cts,2009,RandyL, 08/26/2009,A world-class offering from Cadillac,4,"Given all of the incentives to purchase a new car, I decided to replace my '02 V6 Honda Accord EX, a fine car that I found to be extremely boring.  When I read the reviews of the new CTS I was impressed. When I drove the car I was even more so. Now, after 9K miles I am comfortable in saying that it is everything I expected it to be.  It is truly a world-class car, and GM & Cadillac should be justifiably proud. They have produced a distinctively American entry level luxury sedan with performance, style, and quality. There is no reason to add the phrase ""for an American car"" when comparing it to Euro or Japanese competitors. It's vehicles like the CTS that are critical to GM's recovery."
cadillac,cts,2009,MJLx2, 09/04/2009,One Year Update Review,5,"One year and 17,000 miles ago I bought my '09 CTS.  What a phenomenal car.  Fun to drive, not a single problem, and still a head turner.  Highway mileage has averaged 26 - 29 mpg on road trips - using regular gas.  Truly a terrific car. The AWD was outstanding throughout last year's Chicago winter. The car is still tight as the day I bought it.  The 304 hp engine is quick and powerful with a deep growl when you jump on it. My previous car was a Lexus ES 330 and before that an Acura TL.  Without question this is a much more fun to drive and stylish car with the same reliability and quality of the competition.  Would I buy this car again? - without hesitation. "
cadillac,cts,2009,Jenn, 10/13/2009,My second CTS,4,This new CTS made it even less painful to get rid of my old (2006) CTS. This car is pure pleasure for me. I love everything about it except the fact that it feels so smooth while I am driving it that I don't realize that I am going so fast. I loved my old one but this one stands out by far! Would suggest this car for anyone who is looking for a luxury thrill. The only thing this car doesn't do is make me coffee but it has a button for that and will direct me to the nearest Starbucks.
cadillac,cts,2009,jon, 11/04/2009,2009 Cadillac CTS 4dr sedan 3.6L,4,"Previously owned Mercedes Benz E420, BMW 328i, BMW 325i, Lexus LS 430. Never thought about ever owning a Caddy. Was considering buying BMW 525i or Merc E350, but felt that it is too common. Finally, gave the CTS a shot when I saw it in the showroom. Beautiful cutting edge design on exterior and interior and what an incredible driving experience, rival that of my previous BMW and Mercs.Way better than my Lexus in handling. Much quieter than my 2007 BMW 3 series on highway. Proof that GM can make good car if it wanted too. Highly recommend the new CTS, best bang for the money! One other bonus, dont have to use premium gasoline."
cadillac,cts,2009,cwilson, 11/08/2009,Love my CTS,4,"I had been looking at the CTS since 2007, but the reports I read did not convince me it was the car for me.  This year, however, everything I read was encouraging so I took the plunge and have very happy I did.  My CTS is by far the best car I have ever owned.  It does not get the best gas mileage, but that's not why I bought it.  It is fun to drive, very comfortable, and the perfect size.  It is the best looking car on the road (in my humble opinion!) and handles effortlessly.  My next car will be another CTS if Cadillac maintains the integrity of the car."
cadillac,cts,2009,CTS, 11/19/2009,1 Year Update,4,"This was my dream car. Or I thought it would be. So many things have gone wrong with this car. The battery died stranding us 4 times. The steering wheel squeaks been taken to dealer twice. Steering coulum replaced. It still squeaks. The cooled seats broks. the lumbar support broke, There are some rattles. The key stopped working. The brakes squeal. For a 53k car none of this should happen. Don't get me wrong this is a beautiful car. The interior is top notch. Even though there is too much lumbar support on lowest setting. The interior/ exterior design is amazing. The speakers, navigation, leather, panoramic sunroof, heated/cooled seats are great. Great car, way too many problems for price."
cadillac,cts,2009,c6vette, 11/22/2009,Awesome American Car,4,"I've now owned my car for about a year and a half.  I've put almost 23K miles on it and I still love it as much as the day I got it.  The ride is amazing.  I have the FE-3 performance suspension with summer tires and it rides firm with tons of feedback but still is smooth for the most part.  It's such a blast to fly through a turn in this car and it's incredibly stable.  The car quality is first rate and the materials feel great.  My only issue with the car is that if you push on some of the plastic in the center stack it creaks, which it also does if you go around a turn fast. Otherwise the car is very tight and well made.  Overall I love it."

cadillac,cts,2009,Livscad, 09/03/2019,Where do I even start.,3,"I bought this car used in May of 2017. It’s a beautiful car for sure but it’s been nothing but a money pit since the day I got it. I’ve replaces the throttle body, auxiliary coolant pump, the regular coolant pump, spark plugs, coil packs, the cooling fan resistor, all 4 hubs, the battery 2x, and the headlights are the biggest pain to change. My passenger back window stopped working, park assist stopped working, and my engine light is more than not always on. If I knew what I was getting into I wouldn’t have bought the car. I did some research before purchasing to see what the common problems were and the timing chain aka $$$ was the only real problem that could occur. Im hoping I can keep this car running until I can save up for a Subaru... I feel like I’m driving a lemon and it’s just a huge waste of money. I’m afraid to drive it far distances because it’s every other week with this thing. Who knows what will go wrong next..."
cadillac,cts,2009,Roxbeary, 01/10/2020,"Nice vehicle, but meant for older wealthy people",4,"Nice vehicle. It drove like a dream, but any little problem that occurred was super expensive to fix. Cadillac's are really meant for older people with money. 
Also, this car has weird headlamps. If they are taken off to change the bulb its difficult(for mechanics) to put it back correctly. Water begins to corrode the wires for the lights, this will be a continuous $700 repair. 
Sunroof started leaking at just under 70k miles. It got an average of 17mpg. 

All of this aside, it was a beautiful vehicle that drove nice. I'm thankful for my time with it, but happy to now have something that gets me 41mpg.

I took it back to the dealership and they told me there was nothing they could do because all of the 3.6 L, 304hp, engines do this. They said Cadillac is looking into this but I have heard nothing from Cadillac. I almost had a very bad accident trying to pass someone on the highway when the engine almost stalled."
cadillac,cts,2010,mrsteve1, 02/21/2014,Nice ride .Great style,4,Awd is a must and the exterior Crystal red is hot .The interior style works well for my 6 foot frame. Ultraview sun roof is very sharp. 3.0 engine is fine for me. I'm no race car driver.If you want to race around go for the 3.6..Leather is nice quality and its my kinda car. Reliability is yet to be determined but I opted for the extended GM warranty well worth the 2000 bucks.Takes 87 octane running just under 20 city. Nice heavy car and doors feel like the old days strong and solid!If your looking for a sharp car this is by far it!If you want some real American muscle I would go for the CTS-V...Time will tell how she rolls... but so far I love it!

cadillac,cts,2010,tdbmd, 09/13/2012,Good sports sedan,4,"I purchased my '10 CTS 3.6 with AWD about 6 months ago.
This is my first sports sedan.
The CTS handles great.
Ride is firm but not bone jarring.
3.6 liter motor has good acceleration, but you have to rev it a bit to get the most performance from it.
Have not had any bad weather yet to test the AWD system.
Mileage is about 22 mpg in mixed driving and 26-27 on the hwy at speeds from 65-70 mph.
The interior is comfortable and well finished.
The seats are comfortable but really best for 4 passengers, 5 is a bit tight.
Bose stereo has great sound and I like that you can hook up a iPod to it.
Climate system works well in both heating and cooling."
cadillac,cts,2010,Best Car for price, 08/26/2010,Best car out there if you have the money,5,Very smooth and quiet ride. My son loves the ventilation in the back and perfect acceleration.

cadillac,cts,2010,Fertile12, 02/01/2010,Disappointed,3,"Cadillac has degraded the CTS this year.  Small conveniences have been remover, e.g. rain-sensing wipers, which are no longer available (and the dealer didn't even know about).  The ""easy-out"" convenience rolls the seat back when the engine is stopped but the seat returns to the driving position when the door is opened, indicating poor, unthinking programming. That should be called easy-out but no easy-in.   "
cadillac,cts,2010,DubyaC, 02/02/2010,So Far So Good,4,"I selected the CTS for my first high end car.  Born in the 60's, I can easily remember the days when Cadillac & Lincoln dominated the luxury market.  So I was excited; not just to finally have a Cadillac of my own, but one with modern styling, excellent fit & finish, and outstanding performance.  As they say, it's not your Dad's Cadillac. I love the feedback I get through the tranny - whether the automatic or manual mode. Excellent balance struck between quiet ride and performance suspension.  Handles the corners quite well, but road noise you typically get with such a car is absent - enough for passengers to comment on the quiet cabin.  Acceleration is more than competent."

The back is a little snug. 5.1 Bose sound system is sthe best great sound and lots of power for classic rock.

This is my first step into the American-made auto arena, and I must say I am impressed.  Having always gone the foreign auto route and most recently coming from a 2007 BMW 328i, I was a bit skeptical about buying American.  However, after persuasion from a friend who is a fellow Cadillac owner and the incentives offered on the 2010s, I decided to make the move.  I must say at this point in time, I am completely satisfied with my new luxury sedan.  The car turns plenty of heads, and I love my Black Raven exterior with Ebony interior.  GM, you rock!"

Overall I like it, but interior storage is inadequate, mileage is less than expected and the visibility borders on being dangerous. I compensate by angle parking only on the end of the row and only making right hand turns. I traded a 1998 Q45. The CTS is not in the same class. I wanted to buy American with RWD and the CTS is probably the best."

The seats are hard, the ride is so horrible my wife and I felt Ill when we drove from the dealer to our home (70 Miles).The cruise control will not hold within 3- 4 miles per hour.Service dept. said ""thats the way the way it is"" there are..no adjustments. The grille- bumper assembly on the front of the car does not clear the road by more than 3 to 4 inches. My wife turned off a main highway onto a service road, small dip, damaged and broke ""plastic grille"". Only 200 miles on vehicle. The position of this assembly is actually a safety problem in my opinion.   "

The cost of the Audi S4, A6, BMW 335I & Mercedes E350 are all very high for what you get.  The ability to have it all and at a great pice was perfect for me.  I used Hill Cadillac in Newtown Square PA.  The entire buying experience was top notch.  I highly recommend them to anyone.

cadillac,cts,2010,HoustonMR, 03/28/2010,First Cadillac - Maybe Last,4,"Traded in a Cadillac DTS but drove a Lexus RX prior.  While this is a great looking (and driving) car, my fear of fit and finish of American made cars has come largely true. This car has great pick-up and has some great amenities but it lacks the quality and additional options that foreign car makers like Lexus and Mercedes offer.  My biggest complaint is a constant whistle from the sunroof that the dealer cannot get rid of.  For a car that runs up to $50K this type of defect should NOT occur. Never had issues with Toyota, Nissan or Lexus vehicles before this purchase."

I've already taken it on two long trips - including one on Amtrak's Auto Train service to Florida without a problem. Sound system, bluetooth, navigation are all very good. Performance is excellent. Fuel economy is not too bad considering the car wasn't really designed for efficiency. Car is great for long trips (and passing on two-lane highways!).

Like father, like son; in 2009, I bought my first cadillac...a 2006 DTS and loved it every day until 2 weeks ago when I traded it in for a used 2011 CTS Premium, black raven with 26k miles, a real cream puff (I never buy new). It was way above my expectations and I fell in love all over again. This machine seriously performs and while it's much tighter than the DTS, it still feels and drives like a Cadillac, only better!

This CTS is one of my favorite cars. I had a 3 series BMW AWD and loved the car, but after the warranty expired, it was time for it to go! So I bought the CTS preowned with 20,000 miles and the only complaint is the 3.0 engine. Its a great engine, but it lacks torque for those red light accelerations. Interior is superb, exterior is beautiful! If I was to buy this car over, I would look for the same car with the 3.6! But other than that I love my Cadillac!"

Although the Edmunds reviews are rather critical of the CTS, I found the ride extremely comfortable and the handling very nimble for normal driving (I don't take curves at 80 mph). The fit and finish in this car is exceptional.
The top of the line Premium AWD has every conceivable option that a car enthusiast could want.

The 3.6 is well worth the price premium.
The engine really pulls strong in upper ranges.
Love the audio system that came with this package.

All highway trip managed to get about 25.
CTS still seems pretty popular with older crowds, so be prepared for comments if you are younger and driving one of these."

However, ALL of that isn't worth the car for one reason and one reason only. The absolutely complete MESS of navigation and especially the phone system. 
1) when you get a call, the number appears on the DASH but the CONNECT button is on the NAV SCREEN and it pops up MAYBE 25% of the time. The audio voice will instruct you to hit a button, but when you do... nothing happens and you will lose calls ALL THE TIME. It CANNOT put your iphone contact list into its system (are you kidding?) and the ""hands free calling"" is worse than the Prius (which was horrific). "

Style and Design are the best in class, which I must say is the biggest lure to buy a CTS. Performance is great, has good power and handles better in corners. I am surely disappointed with the drive comfort level, seats itself aren't bad, something about the drivers position and may be the suspension. It gave me a neck ache after a couple hours drive.

cadillac,cts,2012,Dylan, 09/15/2015,Stay away! Keep family Away,1,"I bought an 2012 CTS Lux. It was used with 11,000 miles on it by an one owner who upgraded every six months. In May 2014 I had to take it in due to my airbags randomly being deployed while it was parked in my garage. Under warranty Cadillac replaced both driver and passenger airbag and also said the wiring was messed up and they corrected it. November of 2014 the airbag light came on and I took it down to Cadillac (45 minute drive from where I lived. Same dealer that I bought it from) get there and was told they would get right on looking at it because it was a slow day. 4 hours later I get told they couldn't find out what was wrong with the car and just reset the light. April 21, of 2015 my car now has 32,000 miles on it and I'm on vacation visiting family 900 miles away from home. i drove to a friends house to pick her up to go get my oil changed before I headed back home. My car is off and parked. My keys are in my pocket my wallet and cell phone along with a newer MacBook Pro is in my car locked. My cars electronics for the navigation and airbags and everything else catches fire and destories my trunk and everything in the back seat before the fire is able to be put out. My insurance totals the CTS but they get out of paying GAP of 5,000 dollars. Granted I paid a lot more on my car payments then my 500 dollar a month payment. I contact Cadillac and my insurance both because now I'm stuck with a 500 dollar car payment on a car that is now torched. Cadillac want nothing to do with it since no one died and insurance said they don't care and not there job too. We've always bought GM products and now I think we will be sticking with paying higher repair bills with European cars then with American anymore. So if you are serious about buying this car ask yourself is your life or families live worth the risk?

cadillac,cts,2012,Rita Richardson, 09/15/2017,Buyer Regrets.. Cadillac should only be leased..,3,"We bought our son a cadillac there 10 years ago..  We took really good care of it with regular oil changes etc   It only had 73,000.    When we got it already had 13,000 so he really only drove it 60,000 and in June the engine quit.  We took it to Banks and they said it would be like $7000 or more to fix it and it wasn't even valued at $7000.   I really felt bad as there was absolutely nothing wrong with this car as far a rust or dents or scratches and the interior was in really great condition.   I can't believe that Cadillac doesn't make a car that can't  go more than 73,000.   I have had an oldsmobile that went to 218,000, a blazer that went to 140,000 and I still have a Hyundai that has 115,000.   These are all just regular cars, I really thought if we got a Cadillac..It was built to last. but I guess I was wrong.

Last April 2016..  We bought a 2016 truck and 2012 Cadillac in the same week.  Paid cash.  We paid  $21,000 for the Cadillac and I just took it to a dealer who now says that it is only worth $13,000.  wow an $8000 loss on a car we have had a year and a half. It had 47,000 when we got it and it now has 57,000.   It is in the garage most of the time now as I am afraid to use it to have happen to it what happened to the 2007.

We had a Cadillac previous to these to that the head gasket went on as well.

I guess I should have done more research on these cars and looked at reviews..  I really regret buying this car...  These cars only meant to be leased I guess so you only have them for 2 years and get rid of them.

I will be posting my reviews of these cars on all sites that I can.  It is definately Buyer Beware.  I won't EVER buy another Cadillac..nor will I tell anyone else to do so.

Thank you for reading this

Interior the same as my old one, and in great shape! Exterior is a pearl color. Really wanted black, but this car had low mileage and is in great shape! Like the discount I received from Edmunds! No haggle, just paid the asking price!

It is now September 2020, still love this car! Just a note about the CTS made between 2911 and 2013. These vehicles have a defect in the power train. The bolts back out and break off, which means you could loose you transmission. I was told by the dealer that the problem had been fixed on the 2012. Wrong, I heard something rattling around under the car in 2019. Took it to the dealer and guess what the bolt had backed out on this one too. I had purchased a warranty so no problem getting it fixed. When I get a oil change I always have them check the bolts on the powetrain. Other than that defect its still a great car!

A car loan or get the engine on a car that is lovely runs well. So hopefully I will get another 3 years out of it.  The car overheated no warning.  Let it cool and topped up antifreeze. They say I put too much in and when the pressure went up(drove from Maine to Florida) and the stay was releasing it just continues and lets out too much anti freeze.. and it overheated. Woke up to leave from Jacksonville and engine light and stability lights on. Topped up fluid. again too much as per Cadillac, drop to Daytona where that dealer after $800 got me on the road again. Five minutes of driving and lights on. Drove to South Fla. Brought it to dealer limping running on 4 cal... needed new engine. They said $5k used engine. 6k rebuild this one 11k new one. I said used on(from a rear end) went to pickup car and it was $11k they said they coundnot get the used one so they put in the new one... $10. what was my choice at that time? I hate car shopping and do like this car. Cadillac explained they put in a new engine with a 30,000 mile guaranty. They have followed up making sure the car runs well.

This is something new beginning 2019 with about 58000 miles and 6.5 years of ownership electrical issues are drivers door lock stopped going up and down automatically.

We test drove a BMW 3 when we purchased, the 3 is fine but we use this car for family road trips and the back seat and cargo space on the 3 were a joke.

cadillac,cts,2013,Brian mayer, 01/02/2017,This car is the definition of fun.,5,"This car competes well with the German counterparts, especially in the dollar amount it cost.  You get a lot for the money.  The tech in it is great, the car is quiet, the seats are comfortable, and it travels well with the wife and I, and our two kids.  The fit and finish are top notch.  All of these were a plus because what I was really looking for was a car that handled well and could be a lot of fun.  I have the performance edition and it comes with the 3.6 engine and the FE2 suspension.  The engine provides plenty of power, but straight line speed is not what makes this car a stand out.  After all, a lot of cars have decent 0 to 60mph times.  It's the superb steering, suspension and brakes.  Last summer I really got a chance to push it to the limits by keeping up with an Audi TT on the curvy back roads of Wisconsin.  I finally slowed down when it started raining ( I did have my wife and one of my kids in the car with me).  As for reliability, in the time I've had it, it has only needed to be repaired once.  That was for a leaky seal around the sunroof.  If you want a fun sedan, if you want a family sedan, try this car.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
From here on is an update to my original review.  The car continues to be reliable.  The all wheel drive has been spectacular in these Iowa winters.  It is still a blast to drive.  I just wish the roads where I live were as fun as the roads in Wisconsin.  I've had to replace the tires and it was a little spendy.  But when I bought a sports sedan, I knew things wouldn't be cheap like on my wife's little Hyundai.  I stick with my original assessment:  If you want a fun family sports sedan, the CTS won't disappoint.
From here is another update as of Jan 2018.  The car is still fun.  Last fall I was again driving in Wisconsin.  I picked a very curvy road for the route.  It was awesome taking those 25 and 30 mph curves at 55 and 60 mph.  The same goes for cloverleaf off ramps.  Those recommended safe speeds are routinely surpassed.  Of course, such fun has a price.  I have had to replace both rear wheel bearings.  As I stated earlier, I knew that having a sport sedan would result in extra expenses.  I haven't mentioned the Iowa winters yet.  I have AWD on my CTS.  It has not let me down yet.  The suspension that helps keep the car planted in extreme driving also helps it hang on for these winters.  Again, an awesome car.
It is now January of 2019 and Edmunds has asked me to update my review.  The car still drives great as mentioned before.  I'll concentrate on reliability instead.  Except for a leaky sunroof gasket and the wheel bearings (both were covered under warranty), the car has been nearly fault free.  I do get the oil changed on a regular basis and they perform inspections at that time also.  There are minor electrical glitches.  Every long now and then the sound cuts out from the audio system.  Switching audio inputs (like going from FM to hard drive and back) takes care of that problem.  Every long now and then a message will come up to have my tire monitoring system checked.  Turning the car off clears that out.  And a couple times in the past four years, I've had to drive circles in the local KMart parking lot to recalibrate the compass.  Again, they are minor and free of cost.  Most importantly, they don't detract from the fun driving nature of the car.  I'm looking forward to seeing the replacement for the CTS that Cadillac is working on.  By the time it comes out, I should be ready for another car.
It is now January of 2020.  Not much has changed.  It is reliable and very fun to drive.  Based on what I've read about the new Cadillac CT5, I'm really glad to have this car.  The CT5 is not the great handler that the CTS is.  I hate to see people go away from the Cadillacs, but when the CT5 goes downhill from the CTS, what is the point.  For my next care I'm
 actually looking at the Mazda 6 or the Volkswagen Jetta GLI.  Until then, I'll continue to enjoy driving experience that is the CTS.

cadillac,cts,2013,hb sizemore, 02/29/2016,This Caddy CTS is awesome!!,5,"This automobile is very nice. The model I purchased has Luxury Level One. This includes panoramic sunroof, heated seats, electronic climate control, Bose stereo, and leather seating surfaces that are heated at the flick of a button. There are so many options that it is better just to drive one than attempt to list them all here. Very nice quality on fit and finish, quiet interior cabin and safety features to numerous to mention. This sedan came with high end Michelin tires and the ride is remarkable. Cornering capabilities are upper end and even the 3.0 liter engine will provide you with exhilaration that is unexpected. You feel like your doing thirty when you doing 80.

 I find myself constantly making myself back off the accelerator on the interstate. The car feels nimble driving while you have the security of feeling beefy and strong. I did not buy my sedan for status, I bought it for the performance and architecture. If you really want a car you feel good about this is it. You get so much more for your money with CTS than with its competitors, some of which are over rated because of their high cost. I do not want to bash other brands, as I want to high light my experience with this car. Completely elated and satisfied would be an understatement. Five Stars all the way!!!!
It has now been 18 months since I purchased this vehicle. I am pleased to say this vehicle is the best I have ever owned. Great performance and absolutely no problems. Zero defects. What else could a person want?
So now it is 2020 and the only thing that has happened to my car is that I had to replace a drive wheel bearing on the front right side which was covered under warranty. We have new Michelin tires on it now. I can safely say this is the best performing low cost sedan we have ever owned. The performing characteristics are a bonus. The paint has held up well and there have been no issues with the electronics,hvac,or door and window actuators. Highly recommend this vehicle. Best buy in second and third year of production with under twenty thousand miles for an affordable purchase.

cadillac,cts,2013,Phil Callighan, 10/21/2015,"Still Turning heads, running fine!",5,"Very stylish sedan. This is my daily drive.  Bought it new and have owned it now for over 7 years. Still a great ride. Eight-way adjustable leather front seats make the ride very, very comfortable although this is not sink-in comfort seating. Cabin is quiet. Ride is exhilerating. However, living in northern lower Michigan, I did add snow tires to ensure utmost traction in snow on hilly roadways. Mostly drive this in-town so gas mileage hovers around 16.5 mpg, which is not great, but I believe car was originally tuned to demonstrate acceleration, so I haven't  been eager to change it. Still receiving comments on the ""look"" of the car (mine is Summer Gold color) and I enjoy detailing, so the car usually looks quite good. I haven't been itching to trade it in since it's performing so well. I also like the rearview camera view appearing in the rearview mirror instead of the dashboard view I see on newer models.

cadillac,cts,2014,Richard Domingues Boscovich, 02/23/2015,Cadillac IS back like never before/ Update,5,"Quick update after about six and half years now.  Still extremely satisfied with the car, have no need to update. ZERO issues. Still a joy to drive. Not sure how the new CT5 replacement is compared to the CTS V-Sport. Although the new engine is a 3.0 liter twin turbo with less power. 

 OK. Wanted to update my impressions after 43 months of ownership. Nothing to add really. Other than a software update to the CUE system (did improve its responsiveness) the car has been super reliable. Zero regrets. Still puts a smile on my face.  


 We all know that it takes time for things to go wrong or an annoyance to develop. So let let me start with the slight irritations first. First off I did experience the mist odor in the HVAC after 19 months.  Not bad, but annoyed me. Dealer resolved it at the next oil change. Secondly, and I still have to ask the dealer about this, is the fact that when I changed cell phones from a Windows phone to an iPhone I cannot receive text messages anymore? Used have the car read them to me and be able to respond verbally. Have to figure this out. That is it! Otherwise nothing. I get a smile on my face everytime I get behind the wheel. had the opportunity to drive my buddys new Merc AMG recently. Very nice car. But not as responsive or quick as the V Sport. Also drove the CTS V s few days ago. Outrageous car!! Wow! But if you need a daily driver which can go out when it snows (within reason of course) the V Sport is actually better. That it. But one! Not sure why they are not selling? Crazy for the money. 

The CTS v Sport is, hands down, the best handling sport sedan period. Not BMW, Jag, Lexus.. nothing.  The quality, feel and  finish is excellent.  Drive it!
"
cadillac,cts,2014,JohnnyBos, 03/31/2016,Absolutely love this car,5,"I bought my all-wheel drive CTS last year (2015) - it was a 2014 model year that was still on the lot, so very happy with the deal.  For the past 15 years I drove only German cars, BMW and Volkswagen.  The pros and cons for the CTS:
Pros:
--It manages the amazing trick of feeling substantial while also being light and agile.  Comparing the aluminum body of this car (including doors and trunk) to a BMW 5-series steel body, you realize how much fat and bloat you're carrying around with the BMW.  It shows up especially in the handling of the CTS... it's an absolute racehorse, and a lean and agile one.  Yet the doors close with a very satisfying ""thud,"" same as you find on the German cars.
--Love the exterior design and (almost all) of the interior... it's amazing.  Very sensual and aggressive, sleek.
--On the highway, the open road, it handles better than a 5 series BMW.  Great sound dampening, great control.  Just a heck of a car to drive.
--Some people complain about the CUE entertainment system, but I actually find it pretty simple to use.  It's a million times easier to use than the old ""I-Drive"" systems on the BMW.
--The materials used in the car, the leathers and wood trim, etc., are all top notch.  I was recently inside a BMW M5 - which cost over $100k - and the BMW didn't have anything nicer in terms of interior materials.
--On the inside of the driver's door is a round sticker which you won't find on any BMW, Audi, Lexus, or Mercedes sedan - that sticker says ""Made in Michigan, USA"".  And as someone who cares about our country and our workers, that's the ultimate status symbol.  When Detroit makes a killer car, you can feel great about buying it for a lot of reasons, including where it's made.
Cons:
--The CTS heat seater heats up a little bit slowly and doesn't get the seat very hot, even at max temperature.  The seat heaters on my German cars would burn your tail if you left them on too high / too long.  As someone living in the Midwest I'd prefer a hotter and quicker seat heater.  (The heated steering wheel does heat up quick and hot, however).
--I'm not in love with the design of the steering wheel - could be a little simpler and more elegant looking.  But other than that, and a very small Onstar button panel on the ceiling, the rest of the interior is BEAUTIFUL.  It's sleek and tight and very well put together.
--I would physical buttons which allow you to adjust direction where the air flows in the ventilation system (to feet, to windshield, etc.).  The CTS has buttons which only appear on the screen if you increase/decrease the volume of air flow.  Or you can go through multiple screens to adjust it.  Same with AC... there's no physical button to press for AC... there are other ways to get AC to come out, which show up on the screen, but I prefer to have a direct physical button for it.
--At very, very low speeds... like when the car is just rolling forward of its own power at 3 or 4 mph, without pressing the gas, it feels a little torquey and uneven.  Living in the city, you often end up kind of rolling forward a bit in traffic or a parking lot.  My VW and BMW were more smooth at that super low speed.
That's about it... other than that, it's a totally amazing car.  I recommend it highly to all my friends, colleagues, and other people.  It's a fantastic car and is VERY underrated.
"
cadillac,cts,2014,Scott in Wesern PA, 09/26/2016,Germans Let Caddy Catch Up **UPDATE Mar 2018**,4,"Let's be clear: My Audi A8L, 2009 model was a stellar car. It did everything right and looked damn good doing it. At nearly 110,000 miles, I was faced with two - three garage visits per year @ $1500 a pop... or trade in my Black Beauty. 

In Feb 2017 Mercedes ran a promotion offering 2016 low-mileage E Class turn-ins for a decent price and a 5 year unlimited mileage warranty so I said what the heck. The E Class is a nice car, but it does not have the superior chassis of the CTS. It is also bland on the inside. The CTS interior looks elegant from any seat in the car. Having just zoomed past 30k, there are ZERO rattles or squeaks...a good sign of build quality. I also tested the BMW 5 series and an Audi A6 just to be sure.... Sorry BMW but I have no idea what you guys are trying to accomplish. Audi's are always awesome, but the dash is a bit on the spartan side. As an added bonus, I just swapped out the Pirelli run-flats with a set of Michelin Pilot Sport AS3+ and the Caddy now has the Magic Carpet ride similar to what the A8 delivered.  It still handles like a dream but feels less twitchy. Go Caddy Go!

October 2017 Update: I joined the Cadillac forum where there is a ton of great information. The CTS developed a squeak at very low speeds over minor bumps...the dealer was inspecting the strut and shock components when I looked on the Cadillac forum and it turns out to be the upper and lower control arms. Covered under warranty! They replaced the steering knuckle too, so hopefully I'm good to go for a nice long time. 

The car continues to impress. One important note about Tour v Sport modes: many cars change their demeanor dramatically when you go from Tour to Sport...the CTS,  NOT SO. I inquired to my mechanic if it really does much and he said Oh, Yes. Putting it in Sport mode makes it go from a lion casually walking through the grass to a lioness hunter crouched and ready to pounce. The moment you change your inputs to be more aggressive, the system immediately reacts accordingly. So I leave it in Sport all the time. You never know when your going to have to blow by Bubba's diesel exhaust-spewing truck or put Granny's Prius in her place.

The interior remains rattle and squeak-free. The car fits like a glove. On a recent 300 mile jaunt on mostly hilly Western PA highway roads and keeping within 10mph of the speed limit I returned a highly respectable 26+ MPG. I felt the brakes pulsing a bit on the highway, so I mentioned it to the dealer during the steering knuckle trip and they resurfaced the rotors at no charge! Ahhhhh smooth as silk again.

***Mar 2018***  Little niggly things are creeping their way into nirvana as the odometer zooms past 45,000 miles. The sunroof has a weird squeaky-creak. Nav map orientation, which I always use with heading up, likes to re-orient itself to north up. Yesterday the tranny couldn't decide between 2nd or 3rd and shuddered between the gears for a good 5-6 seconds...even the wife said ""what was THAT?""  

More worrysome is my dealership got rid of the guy who ran the service department and replaced him with a complete nincompoop. My car threw a pair of codes related to the front suspension, so I called, made an appointment, and told the nincompoop the codes and said WRITE THEM DOWN since I'll be clearing the codes with my OBD-II scanner. Upon arrival at the appointment, it was as if I had never existed prior to that moment in time. I nicely reviewed what we had previously agreed to, and he (in a huff) went to the car with his scanner and came back and said there are no codes to which I replied ""Because I erased them after I told you what they were I am not driving around for a week with the check engine light on"" to which he replied, more huffily, ""Then we'll have to put it on the computer"" No s**t Sherlock. I asked for my keys back and have been looking at used Audi A8's. There are some
 tremendous deals out there!
SO 6 months ago Rockville Audi had a 2015 A8 4.0T CPO with 18k miles for less than 50% of the $97k sticker. See my review under 2015 A8's and kindly bow to the depreciation gods. They gave me a more for the CTS than I anticipated, and I am now driving one of the world's truly magnificent automobiles. Thank you Cadillac nincompoop!
April 20019 Update  To reinforce my decision, I tested a 2018 CTS 6 cyl -  twitchy and loud compared to the Audi. Still has great handling, and that is by far its best attribute. CUE never bothered me, and many luxury brands are headed in the touch screen direction, but I love my buttons. Put 20k on the Audi in a year and could not be happier! If the CTS could refine the chassis a bit and make it significantly quieter on the inside, it will certainly return to my short list when the Audi expires.

cadillac,cts,2014,sammyboy542, 12/04/2013,Thoroughly pleased,5,"I have always been indifferent towards Cadillac cars.
I have never found them all that exciting.
This car has intrigued me since it was introduced earlier in the year.
I was in the market for a mid-size luxury car stepping up from an Audi A4, and after comparing BMW, Audi, Mercedes, and Cadillac, this is what I landed on.
Obviously this is subjective, but I think the styling is absolutely stunning.
The drive is very engaging when you want it to be and extremely comfortable when commuting.
From my experience of riding and driving multiple Cadillac cars in the past this is the first time I've ever been compelled to purchase a cadillac car myself -- at 29 yrs of age."
cadillac,cts,2014,james85018, 06/15/2014,CTS V-sport premium,4,"I comparison shopped/drove quite a bit before buying this car in June 2014.
Handling and the engine performance are superb--better than the E550 and 550i.
The interior may be a smidge behind the Germans in terms of fit/finish, but it is a minimal difference. The CUE system isn't intuitive, and I'd prefer just knobs and a straightforward information management system.
It took me about three days to feel like I had the hang of CUE. My car has the upgraded Kona wood interior, which is absolutely beautiful; I don't know that I'd pay for it, however, if not for the $6000 in incentives GM offered ($3000 rebate + $3000 ""conquest"" cash) and dealer's willingness to negotiate.

cadillac,cts,2014,Ray Anderson, 09/15/2016,One Amazing Sedan,5,"After purchasing a 2016 BMW X3 35i and completely being disappointed in it, this car is complete 180 degrees.   I purchased a used 2014 CTS Vsport premium that just came off a lease.  With under 25K in miles and half the warranty and free maintenance left this car it was a deal from a new one.   I have to say they are a bit pricey new, but there are usually some good incentives out.  With that, I have to say this is an amazing car.   The interior is what a luxury car should be.  Nice materials and everything feels solid and well build.  Seats are comfortable and driving position is just right.  I just don't understand why all the auto critics hate the CUE system.  I think it works just fine.  No system is perfect, but other than the volume control being slow sometimes, everything else works fine.   Handling and acceleration are outstanding.  The car is quick and corners like it is on rails.  Usually good handling comes at the expense of ride quality.   Magnetic ride control has master these two feats.   GM has really knocked it out of park with this car.  It is sleeper.   It gives you all the comfort of a luxury car with the performance of sports car.   This is the perfect balance between the two.  Given the fact I have a bit a lead foot, it is returning 19 MPG on average.  This is not bad.

cadillac,cts,2014,John, 04/17/2016,Not my pappy's caddy,4,"I've owned my '14 CTS 3.6 Premium for a year now and can clearly judge this car.
Pros - incredible handling for a sedan, very solid acceleration for NA V6, GREAT braking, impeccable interior (good or better than ANY other mid lux in class hands down)
Cons - performance is good, not great (understand it's not the VSport, however), resale value is AWFUL (was intrigued by ATS-V and dealership was going to barely pay off and I got an incredible deal on car...VERY disappointing.  Lastly, the sound of the exhaust leaves something to be desired...
Overall this car is absolutely fantastic.  Handles, drives and feels like a very well put together sporty mid-size luxury and clearly is at level of MB E350 level or BMW 5 series...tested both and CTS beat both out in nearly every level.  This Cadillac ""move"" is only going to get better and I'm excited as I hope I never am interested in a german car again.  If I could buy the new CTS-V it would be mine but the price is Porche 911 Turbo level...yikes.

Caddy, well done and worth the buy for anyone considering a mid-size luxury sedan.  Great car and many people are impressed by the car's beauty and style.
"
cadillac,cts,2014,lajollaboy, 02/18/2016,Let's get this straight...,5,"Being an avid enthusiast and owner of my '14 Vsport Prem I have read and viewed about every review article and video on the internet.  With some of the reviews, I truly wonder if they are driving the same car I am!  So, for the format of this review, I'm going to pick out those things I commonly read with which I disagree - both good and bad.

1.  ""Fit and finish not as good as German competitors -""  This is the one I really don't get at all.  People complain of cheap plastic and the like... I honestly don't know where they are getting this from.  My car is rock solid - from squeeks and rattles to the feel of the controls.  The only thing I've had problems with is that the glove compartment which actually has two latches (!) sometimes only catches one of the latches.  But that's it.  I find my interior design elegant and tasteful and much more progressive than the Germans.  UPDATE 9/18: The glove box has been just fine.  My sunroof creaks sometimes though.

2.  ""CUE is terrible.""  Cue is designed to be a highly customizable owner experience which for somebody (like a car journalist) who drives the car for a day (or even a week (or even shares the car with other journalists as part of a long term tester)) may find it frustrating.  But once you do have it set up and understand how to get to things, it's really a very well designed system.   You can get to most of the things you need from the steering wheel and view your changes in the instrument pod (as opposed to the middle screen) which I would much prefer to having to reach for a joystick and look to the middle screen every time.  With that said, despite being able to do most things from the steering wheel, finger prints are still a problem as noted by many, especially if you have a frequent passenger who doesn't like your music (Zoe!!!) and it would be nice to know what the temp controls are set at without having to tap and return on the screen.  

3.  ""The touch sensitive buttons are unrepsonsive.""  ... like the slider volume control.  This is just patently not true. The metallic guides for proper finger placement are very useful.  I use these buttons many times a day and have never been frustrated by them.  I am sorry that Cadillac has bent to journalists' pressure to get rid of them.  UPDATE 9/2018:  I'm still bewildered by the criticism of these buttons.  I know Cadillac is moving away from them because of the bad press but I really do not like at all the new buttons.  I'm going to keep my car for ever!!!

4.  ""Doesn't have features that a similar model from the German three would have.""  This is laughable.  For every feature the Cadillac doesn't have at a price level, it provides 10 others that the competition doesn't have.

5.  ""The interior is tacky.""  Nope.  It's awesome.  Its just not 80's vintage matte black with random dials, buttons and switches all over the place [sarcasm] like typical German cars.      Most of the interior is leather and natural wood.  I mean for God's sake, THE HORN ON MY STEERING WHEEL is made of LEATHER!  I love it!  I wish the display were higher res, though.  UPDATE:  I still love my interior.  I have the digital dash which I think makes a big difference.

Now the bad...

1.  ""Incredible power train!""  While the car is crazy fast, the engine can feel a little choppy showing its V6-ness through the rev band if you wind it out.  The throttle is WAY too sensitive and the transmission takes a lot of getting used to and even then some of the shifts are a bit abrupt.  You'll get used to it but until then you and your passengers will have some sore necks!  :)

2.  ""Incredible ride and handling!""  Oh yes it does!  ... at least after you change the tires from the PZeros that it comes with.  Those things are made of cement!  

3  ""Turns a lot of heads.""  Sadly, most people want to see a German luxury car badge.  I think my car looks very cool but I'm
 surrounded by BMWs and you know those guys aren't too forthcoming with compliments on American cars.

All and all, I love my car!  It's fast, comfortable and the styling is so cool (inside and out), it's unbelievable!  UPDATE 9/2018:  I still love my car.  I marvel at it every day.  It's been very reliable after some initial items were fixed when it was under warranty.

cadillac,cts,2014,Disappointed Owner, 05/21/2017,Worse than expected,2,"I live in Los Angeles and so I'm on the freeway a lot with stop and go traffic. The engine performs extremely poorly at those low speeds around 15 mph when it's shifting to the next gear. The car always jumps in shifting gear at the low speed. In acceleration, the gears shift fine with no issues. However, as it gets to about 45 mph, it struggles again where you need to really press on the accelerator again. It also has a rough idle, the touch screen isn't responsive at certain spots, the sensors activate when the car is at a complete stop and no car is moving, the sensors in the car will beep for a minute then stop, and backing up if you're near something and are aware and you lift your leg off the brake, the car with do a shuddering self brake scaring the scrap out of you.

With the CTS and ATS they couldn't be more wrong. These Cadillacs are not marketed very well. Truth is they are amazing on road track cars. 5 link rear suspension. Spectacular steering dynamics. This car belongs on a track. Even the ""cheaper"" 2.0T with 300lb ft of torque. It's on par with Subaru WRX and Ford ST. Unfortunately Cadillac doesn't market these models well. They should build a 320Hp 2.0T with a V-sport badge and all the body cladder. Price it aggressively. Market it on the Drift circuit. Get young people excited about it.

cadillac,cts,2014,mel blain, 07/01/2017,A real beauty!,5,"I had wanted a CTS back in 2009 but couldn't get the payments and trade in value right so had to settle for something I really didn't want, but came to love.  After 147K miles and a few things starting to go out, had to make the decision to buy a newer car.  Glad it worked out where I didn't get one then, as the 2014 I just got was well worth the wait.  Obsession Red and a real looker!  Jury is still out on the smoothness of the ride, considering  it is a Cadillac, but the features on it are amazing.  I literally had to read the Owner's Manual from cover to cover just to understand how all the gadgets work!  Still learning.  Right now, I am averaging 21.7 MPH, which I feel is great!  Road trip later this month, so we are looking forward to seeing how it handles on the interstate.  Keep up the good work, Cadillac!

Update 1/8/20:  I still love my 2014 CTS and can now say that the average MPH is 24.4!  I feel we get a smooth ride on the road, having taken it on a couple of 1000+ mile road trips since first buying it.  Technology rating has decreased, as the Cadillac Cue went out within the first year, but was replaced under warranty with no further issues.  Even though she is now 6 years old, we still get compliments on her, and can say that she sure doesn't look her age!  Can barely tell the difference between ours and the 2019 models!

At low speeds its fast to respond (0-50).  At higher speeds it doesnt feel fast but you will be driving 80mph and not relize it.  Handles excellent although in sharp turns it tends to feel like it slows down to complete a turn.  I have the premium so every luxury is available which i like.  My tall 12 yr old daughter doesnt think tge back is roomy.  Im not sure because ive never been in tge back set.  The front seats are extremely comfortable.  It is a hrad turner on the outside.  I didnt realize that it would get so much attention.  People love this car.  When they see the inside they are in complete aww of tge car.  My true only complaint is the cue system 2.0hmi it lags and is sliw and turns off when you least expect it to do so.  I will get the upgrade of the nav cue system i hear it way better.

cadillac,cts,2014,Josh B, 01/02/2019,Why do People Call This An Old Person Car?,4,"For starters I love this car. I am a 23 year old who has always loved fun sporty cars. The CTS with the 2.0t feels fantastic with smooth acceleration and instant torque. The build quality is great and still holding up over 70,000 miles without any annoying rattles or loose interior bits. I used my CTS as a daily commuter over the past year and have taken multiple 1000 mile+ road trips. The car is decently comfortable and handles amazing going down the road (especially with magnetic ride control). I live in Michigan and I have had no problems driving through snow or ice with the AWD and Pirelli P-Zero near all seasons that are on it. My biggest complaint with this car is the transmission. The 6 Speed auto shifts fantastic when you are doing more spirited driving, but when cruising through traffic at light throttle it can be a little jerky at times. Overall I love this car and I highly recommend it.

cadillac,cts,2015,Steve M, 04/04/2018,Jury is still out but I love driving it,5,"This car has had some gremlins in the first month of ownership. MAP sensor tripped at 15k. Crankshaft Position Sensor relearn came on and can only be relearned with a GM tech II  or similar scanner. Then the power steering light comes on and power steering switches to manual. Once you restart the car, it comes back on, but has gone back off again. Of all things, this is concerning and dangerous if it occurs during a turn. Hopefully my mechanic will figure it out and I can get some miles on this beauty. I will update this review. I know...I know... many say they will, but don't. I will however. As far as how it drives: this car moves well for a 2.0 and has all the power I am looking for. gas mileage is decent for a heavier AWD car. It corners great and hugs the road with little body lean. Of course, the suspension is stiffer, so you're not going to get the traditional floating Cadillac ride and will feel more bumps, but it's not bad. The cornering makes up for it. You can even adjust it some. The CUE system is not hard to figure out and so far works well. 2014-15 versions though can't upgrade to Apple Play or Android Auto via the dealership. There are people who claim to do it with a $750 upgrade on Ebay, but I'll just use my phone in a holder. I wish they had the adaptive cruise avail on the Luxury version, but the Lane Assist is nice. So....while it hs many of the bells and whistle, power and styling I want, the main thing is will it be reliable. Reviews don't indicate it will have engine or tranny issues but I'll see what happens with the electrical gremlins before saying this is a great car.

Ok...here is my updated. No issues with the car. Love driving it so much, I sold my Town Car, as I found myself only driving the CTS. Nice power, fair mpg, nice interior, very comfortable. Very happy with the car.

cadillac,cts,2015,Rishi B, 10/27/2018,Cadillac...The Standard Of The World...Again,5,"Owned many Cadillacs over the years and they continue to get better and better.  As much as I consider trying another make next time around, they come out with something new to reattract me.  Contrary to some opinions, my Cadillacs never go to the shop unless its for an oil change, covered by Cadillac.  The CTS was leased for 39 months and is coming to an end.  I have 45K miles on it and the fancy electronic glove box needed to be fixed recently.  The CUE system, which has had complaints since its release, was replaced once by Cadillac.  Apparently the fingerprints on the screen get embedded due to the heat but was replaced under warranty without concern.  I have owned Mercedes BMW Infiniti...Cadillac seems to outshine all around in looks and reliability.  Its a shame they arent getting credit for being as good as they are...

cadillac,cts,2015,Mike S., 04/23/2017,Satisfied with my purchase 18 months later.,5,"I love my base CTS. The 2.0L Turbo four and six speed is great. I am very happy I missed out on the 8-speed in the '16 up as well as the standard auto stop/start as I have had loaners I didn't love. Sad I had to go aftermarket for a backup camera in the base trim though that is now standard for '16 and newer. My biggest issue is the resale value. It is much like an Audi as the bottom fell out of the value right away and I haven't caught up with my payments yet. That said I'm not mad about this as I love the car and wouldn't replace it except for maybe an ATS-V with a standard transmission in a year or two.

cadillac,cts,2015,Bling master, 01/27/2016,Great luxury sedan,5,"I traded a BMW 3 series for the mid size CTS . I enjoyed my time in the BMW. The caddy handling is very close to the e90 handling and better than the handling of BMW F10 platform. I purchased the car on its merits fun to drive, superb performance, luxury and dealer support. The car has performed flawless for the first 13,000 miles. CUE has a learning curve but so did gen 2 idrive. The CTS is a goid value as noone is paying the sticker price.Forget the GM bashing this is a great car.

None could touch this car for sheer value for the money, features, comfort.  But, Big surprise, it rides and handles as well , I think better, than Volvos I've owned or Audi, Acura.  Lots of comfort, much more style, Its a better car and I expect will be far less costly to won than the German makes especially.  I also own a Corvette (been a vette owner for years) so I know what good handling, acceleration, braking should be like.

Suspension is firmed than my Town Car and my old Caddys, but that is expected. Had some Gremlins with the Map sensor, then the Crankshaft Position Sensor, then the power steering. None of these sensors needed replaced. They would throw a code, which was reset and no further issues. Car has great lines and a sleek look. Interior, I feel like I'm in a cockpit. Getting in/out isn't as easy as my 2012 MKZ or my 03 TC, but it's not bad. The car gets 28mpg on the highway, so not bad. My only regret is I wish the car had the adaptive cruise. Except for that, it is the only bell I didn't get that I wanted.

cadillac,cts,2016,Next2pool, 07/26/2016,Everything is better than the previous CTS,5,"If you owned a Gen II CTS, this one will be better in every category. The new V6 is very strong and I'm averaging about 26 MPG in all around suburban driving. The interior is very quiet but the road noise from the front is the only complaint I have. There is almost no wind noise. The interior material quality is excellent and the fit and finish is superb. I am disappointed in the autostop performance. When it does activate (when is hard to predict) the engine has an annoying shudder when it stops as well as restarts. I have driven other GM models that are much better. The transmission shifts very well and doesn't seem to have a problem managing 8 gears. Although I like the hard inside cover for the sunroof, the roof itself does not seem to open as far as the previous version and it looks a bit clunky from the outside when open. The Cue system is much faster than before I have no problem with the controls at all. I did expect the Navigation system to have a more colorful display and I can't see how to name a route for future use. The gooseneck trunk hinges seem to be a step backwards from the articulated system of the Gen II model. The front seats are better than before but still not all that great for longer trips. Overall, I am very satisfied by this new CTS.

Update 1 year after purchase: I did have a transmission issue that was annoying. After a stop with the auto stop/start active, the transmission would have an abrupt 1-2 shift. It did that since new and i realized that it couldn't be normal. GM replaced the transmission and the problem is gone--it apparently was a manufacturing defect and not a common problem. I replaced the run flat tires with conventional tires and that eliminated the road noise that I was complaining about. The gas mileage is outstanding in all around driving. Overall this is the best car I have had. It is a pleasure to drive.

cadillac,cts,2016,Karl, 07/18/2017,The Cadillac of CTSs,5,"I couldn't be happier with my 2016 CTS.  The car looks fantastic, and aggressive, from every angle -- classic Cadillac.  And the CTS 3.6 AWD has the performance to back up its looks, with tremendous acceleration (0-60 in 5.3 seconds), razor-sharp handling, and confident braking.  The interior is beautifully designed and crafted, including aromatic leather seats, a pleasing and logical dash design, and natural grain wood trim.  I find the driver's seat as comfortable as any I've ever sat in, and was able to achieve the perfect driving position after a few days of fiddling.  I'm also enamored of the 13-speaker Bose Centerpoint sound system, which produces striking musical fidelity; the excellent navigation system; and the extra-large panoramic sunroof.  Between the CTS's cosseting interior and raging performance, I thoroughly enjoy my commute to and from work, particularly on the back roads that I take to avoid traffic.  I also look forward to chauffeuring my son around to his various activities, and would note that there is ample room in the back for child car seats, not to mention tall adults.  As for maintenance (i.e., changing the oil and other fluids and rotating the tires), it's free for four years, and my local Cadillac dealer treats me like a rock star.  I've had zero problems with this car, and highly recommend it.

cadillac,cts,2016,broberts, 06/17/2016,CTS #2,4,Liking the car so far (1month now).  The fuel saving feature - where the engine cuts off at a stop - is a pain.  Glad there is an override feature.  The SUV does not have the override and that was at least one of the eliminating features for me to consider that vehicle.  Very nice acceleration.  Good gas mileage so far.
cadillac,cts,2016,KK, 08/02/2016,RWD CTS is fun!,4,"I got the CTS as I didn't want to get an SUV. I wanted something that was fun to drive. I got one with a 2.0T engine as it is plenty powerful for my needs. Mine is a base sedan (RWD only!) with upgraded leather seats, panoramic sun roof and park white color as the options. The car has it's quirks, but nothing that you cannot live with. CUE is as good as a touch screen infotainment system gets. Don't believe the negative reviews out there. Use it and find out out yourself. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a fun to drive family sedan that can fit 5 passengers with ease.

cadillac,cts,2016,Danny, 07/14/2016,Make sure you don't mind the AutoStart feature,3,"The Auto Stop/Start is terrible.  It may not bother everyone (I cannot fathom how people don’t mind this), but it is annoying and distracting every time you stop the car.  The car shakes and jiggles at every stop sign and stop light.  My passengers are incredulous when they’re first taken for a spin.  It is not only annoying, but also distracting.  Your mind goes to it every single time you stop.  You can turn this off every time you start the car, but it is not possible to turn this feature off permanently.

Almost all the 2016 Caddys have Auto Stop/Start (I think the XTS is the only one that doesn’t) and they take the fun and relaxation out of driving.  Make sure you thoroughly test drive them before buying.  When test driving, make sure you do some city/urban driving and turn the A/C off (it doesn’t kick in when the A/C is chugging at a decent rate).  Like I said, it won’t bother everyone, but will bother many.  Enough so that GM put out a couple bulletins on the subject.  These are for the ATS and CTS, but I would think it applies to all 2016s with Auto Stop/Start.  Check out #15-NA-033 “Normal Characteristic – Slight Bump, Jerk or Rough Engine Startup [Oct 15, 2015]”.  It says “Condition: some customers may comment that there is a slight bump, jerk or rough engine startup during an AutoStart event”.  Then it says, “Correction: This is a normal condition”.  I guess they said it was unusual, then had to correct it and say it is a normal condition!!!  Directive #16-NA-071: Diagnostic Tips for Stop/Start and Auto Stop Operation [Mar 4, 2016] says, “Condition: Vehicle does not engage in Auto Stop mode and Vehicle automatically restarts during an AutoStop event”.  It goes on to say, “It is imperative that the customer be well informed about the unique features and operational characteristics of their vehicle equipped with Stop/Start.  For the sales team to be fully prepared, they should use the Getting to Know Your Vehicle guide as an outline when presenting the vehicle to the customer”. Cadillac knows this is a terrible and they are not notifying their customers.

Other cons: the run-flats are a poor ride; they’re loud and you can feel everything.  The 2016 CTS models don’t come with a spare and instead have run-flats.  The tactile sliders/”buttons” are over-engineered.  Just give me a knob for the radio volume; ditto for the A/C fan speed.  Also, a little more difficult to get out of than previous CTS.

Pros:  trunk is larger than previous CTS; nice and roomy.  The panel that comes up in the dash is a cool storage area (and lockable).  Cool feature that lets you program the radio so you are notified when your favorite band is on XM.  Bluetooth with phone is loud and clear.

cadillac,cts,2016,Joel Adler, 10/12/2019,Second time is a charm,5,"I had a 2016 CTS Performance and I loved everything about it except the tires and wheels. The Pirelli run flats were the worst. 
The Premium package adds adaptive cruise control and looses the Pirelli tires. Although the Continental tires are not as wide and less aggressive on the road, they more than make up for it on comfort. 
I don’t know why people malign the CUE system. 
It is logical and easy to use. 
The cabin is comfortable.  This car is great for long rides no matter what type of road. 
This is a great looking, great handling car. Before purchasing this car I looked into 2016 Mercedes E class and 2016 BMW 5 series. The Caddy offers more technology than either at a comparable price. 
I’m glad I bought it. 
Several months have gone by since I wrote my review. I have put on a lot of miles since this review was first written. My opinion has not changed. 
This is a solid, comfortable car. It handles well and people still think it is new, even though it’s over 4 years old. 
Update;
The more I drive the car, the better the gas mileage gets.  One major advantage with the CTS is that it takes regular gasoline.  This can save several hundred dollars a year at the pump.
I recently had the car on a nice winding road.  It drove great.  There was a point where I had to pass another vehicle.  When I stepped on the accelerator, the exhaust gates opened up and the sound was great. The car took off like it was shot out of a cannon. I am still happy with my choice.

We finally told them to keep the car until it was fixed , they put grease in the sunroof track to stop the noise that didn't work they the put tape in between the tracks that hasn't help  the dealer said YOUR NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THE PROBLEM so I guess we are going to have to take it the way it is.

I love the XTS, the most comfortable car I've ever owned, ad thought about downsizing to the CTS Luxury as i like the exterior.   Appearance is great, the interior is basically the same look as my XTS however it is more cramped and the quality is a bit less, but being a downsize from the XTS i was not put off by that.  The ride is horrible!!  It's like driving an old pick up.  You feel every pebble, the engine noise is annoying.  The front seat is very comfortable though, I am 6 ft. so had the seat back almost all the way, making the backseat behind me useless.  Not a big issue for me, but thought i'd point it out.  The biggest problem with this car is the price.  They want more for a CTS and my XTS which is roomy, comfortable and rides like a cloud.

cadillac,cts,2016,Greg, 06/23/2017,Car is really nice but suspension?,4,"I have 37,000 miles on this car and the engine performance, braking & handling remain excellent except for the same issues.
The suspension remains shockingly harsh, especially the front and even in Touring mode. When going over bumps like highway milled to paved surfaces the transition patches/ramps can't be absorbed smoothly. A pothole is bone jarring. I don't think the car is meant for run flat tires?
The other issue is road/wind noise. Still not quiet enough.
A few things that are less than desirable.
The Bluetooth and Apple Carplay complaints I had seem to have been resolved at the last dealer maintenance.
Rear seat leg room remains way too cramped.
Trunk space and accessibility remains very poor and would have been better if the rear bumper access point was lowered to the trunk floor level. This height difference seriously limits the length of items you can put in and is further limited by the narrow back seat opening. 
I'd consider an XT5 if they redesigned it. The front is ugly and the stance should be lower & flat and it badly needs performance! An XT6 would be nice. More aggressive and a hot rod.
Otherwise I might consider the C6 2.0TT.

cadillac,cts,2016,MMiller, 02/16/2020,Best luxury sport sedan of the past decade.,5,"This is one of the most under appreciated cars on the road. It reminds me of what BMWs use to be. In fact I haven’t had this much fun driving a sedan since my 2001 5 series. If you are into driving dynamics and performance this is the car for you. The CUE system is one of the best infotainment systems I’ve used and gas mileage isn’t bad (27.1 mpg) in suburban driving (conservative driver). There have been no significant mechanical issues. The drive train is fantastic (0-60 4.5 seconds).
So if you’re thinking about BMW, Mercedes or Audi look at the CTS VSPORT. If you like Lexus this car is not for you because it’s  actually fun to drive.
Well I liked the 2016 so much I went out and traded it for a 2019 CTS-Vsport. This was the last year for this car so I wanted the freshest example because I plan on keeping it awhile. The drive train with the Asian 8 speed transmission is exceptional. I think this alone sets it apart from the standard CTS and even the mighty V.

cadillac,cts,2016,Terry Gosser, 03/12/2016,Very Disappointed,3,"Found the new Luxury Cadillac CTS 4 (all wheel drive) disappointing.  As usual still rides the same as 25 years ago.  Noise from tires, exhaust, engine come right through with the stereo set on low, requiring music to be turned up.  Lacks innovation, and technology, poor aero dynamics causing poor mileage.  Very heavy for no obvious reason except they're stuck in 90's.   Mercedes comes out with touch shift, GM will have to copy it.  Lexus are perfectly quiet on the inside, Cadillac has yet to copy.  Just seemed like a poor performance from all angles with little innovation.  I will go with Mercedes or Lexus over this manufacturers offerings.  Priced at 65,000 and told it rides like a Cadillac.  If you want poor quality still from a U.S automaker.  Test drive after driving a lexus or Mercedes and you to will be disappointed in a Cadillac just as I was.  Probably be another 15 years before I give them another chance with such poor planning and innovation.

"
cadillac,cts,2016,AG, 10/08/2020,No regrets - the love is lasting.,4,"I've owned my 2016 CTS 3.6 AWD Luxury package for almost 5 years now, and I have to admit I still love driving this car.  Even without MRC this car has a taught, firm ride and sharp, responsive steering.  Although way down on practical power compared to the blown sixes in the competing BMW 535xi, Audi A6, and Mercedes E400, this NA V6 has more than enough power for everyday use and surprisingly has a nice growl that is unobtrusively amplified through the Bose sound system in Sport mode.  Otherwise, the car is dead silent inside with little wind or road noise.  The 8 speed transmission works well and shifts quickly with the paddle shifters in sport mode, but even sport does not result in a much more aggressive shift pattern in automatic.

The Bose sound system is not bad - not great, but better than most Bose systems I've experienced.  I have no issue with the updated CUE interface in this car, and the touch-sensitive controls are complemented by a comprehensive set of steering wheel controls (although nothing beats knobs for volume and tuning).  The Nav interface is very dated and the included maps are hopelessly old.  The backup camera resolution is very poor, but by 2019 my dealer replaced the camera under warranty with an updated, upgraded part that makes it acceptable

The interior is ""Germanic"", but with a dose of style.  At least in all black, the different materials in different areas is not noticeable, and all contact surfaces are soft-touch.  The genuine open-pore wood trim is surprisingly classy, especially with the discreet LED lighting at night.

With the exterior design now 7 years and a generation old, this model still looks great to me and, maybe because it's not a very popular/common car in a sea of BMWs, continues to draw compliments in parking lots.

I recently bought a GM extended warranty and decided to keep the car for at least 3 more years - I've rarely hung on to my DD car for more than 2-3 years.
"
cadillac,cts,2016,Rick, 11/02/2020,Time,2,"Well, as time has passed, the shoddy Craftsman has reared its ugly head. Creaks and rattles are prominent. The CUE system is 100% shot. The transmission lurches and bucks. Never again. "
cadillac,cts,2017,Brad, 12/27/2017,Certified Pre-owned is the way to go,5,"This part is an update. I still love this car however occasionally the Cue system will lock up when using Android Auto. If you don't start Android Auto on your phone before using it in the car, after you use a voice command it will sometimes just lock up and the CUE system will be unusable until you unplug your phone or turn your car off. It would be nice if you could use Android Auto without having to plug your phone up to the car via USB. Other than that I love this car! I would definitely buy it again.

All of the online reviews (Motor Trend, Car and Driver etc. and YouTube) are spot on except for one thing. The CUE system has been upgraded in 2017 and is fast as a phone or tablet so all of their disparaging comments about it are no longer valid for this year model and subsequent. Some reviewers complain that when they touch the silver trim on the center console nothing happens. It isn't designed to. You have to touch the lighted controls. They should just figure it out and get over it. Some reviewers complain about no volume knob. I typically use the steering wheel controls so that isn't an issue for me. They don't have knobs on their phones and they seem to cope. Very comfortable seats (I don't have the Recaros), very high quality interior, great performance, very high tech in the Premium Luxury model. Great looking car inside and out. I can't think of a single option they could add to this car (well maybe massaging front seats). If you buy this car I don't think you will regret it. I guess my only negative comment on it would be they should sell it with all season tires instead of summer tires. I drove this car plus an ATS V and a CTS V and for the money I think this is the best value for the all around package. You only spend a small amount of time having fun with the acceleration compared to hours cruising down the highway. I would rather lean toward the additional comfort (and better looks IMO) of the CTS over the ATS and paying an additional $20-30K for an extra 200 horsepower in the CTS V wasn't worth it to me. I'm satisfied with 420 horsepower.

The black metallic 2017 CTS wig the black interior is absolutely a head turner. There isn’t a day that goes by that “she” doesn’t get multiple compliments. If you want a beautiful car that outclasses the vast majority of the other rides out there, the 2017 CTS will do it for you. Great to drive as well. Only thing I’m getting used to compared to my previous CTS which I still love and drive is the steering isn’t as precise. Still good but definitely different.

cadillac,cts,2017,William, 10/04/2018,"CTS V-sport, best car for the $ that nobody buys",5,"Shop around and take full advantage of all the discounts for sure.  Be sure and drive one on a nice twisty road as well before buying.  First off the new ""cue"" system so far has ZERO issues and I really like it.  Now as for the car, I bought the regular one as I hate sun roofs, and was looking for a nice large comfortable daily driver for all seasons. I planned to keep it for 3 years. Another factor was the price vs performance curve. I was also looking at audi A8, bmw 7 series and Mercedes CLS.  What primarily sold me was the online reviews of the handling of the cts as well as ( imho) I really love the exterior looks.  The price point I paid after all the GM, dealer ,end of year etc was nearly 20,500 off of the MSRP so that and the fact that is really goes pretty well for a v6  totally sold me.  A few things I think could be improved on   1) hvac system should be more accurate as to temp settings 2) the transmission while good, compared to the ZF 8 speed is ""acceptable"" at best, it shifts far to slow in the sport and track modes. 3) seats should be offered with a massage function 4) The stock run flat tires are HORRIBLE it should have come with most any other brand but Pirelli's for sure, and NO run flats!  The interior is very nice for a GM product, seat adjustment if very good for bigger guys i'm 6'6"" and have zero issues. Handling and suspension are spot on , they totally nailed that for sure.  All in all I really like the car far better than I thought I would when buying it, I've always had Porsche,BMW or Mercedes before this. Would I have bought it for sticker price (70's) ummm maybe but probably not. However for the mid  to low 50's it is in fact a fantastic bargain for the money.

cadillac,cts,2017,Gary S, 04/19/2019,Been That - Done There,1,"I traded my well liked Audi A6 in on a Cadillac CTS on the advice of a friend who owned one.  He's still my friend but I am no fan of the Cadillac.  The 4 cylinder 2.0 turbo sounds like it belongs in a Chevrolet Cruz and the often experienced ""turbo lag"" explained away by the dealer as ""just how turbos are"". Terribly disappointing.  The info system is a joke - you're lucky if you don't wrap yourself around a pole trying to operate it while driving.  And the run flat tires - when it's cold it feels like your driving on 4 blocks of ice.  To add insult to injury the tires only lasted 17,000 miles.  Handling was ok but not great as was cabin noise.  The heated/cooled seats did neither very well. The Bose sound system is very good and about the best thing on a very mediocre and disappointing vehicle.  "
cadillac,cts,2017,TexIrish, 02/07/2018,good looking,4,"The seats do not vibrate during lane depature.  Other than that, this is one neat car.  Good gas mileage, great ride for a car this size.  Wish Cadillac would fix the vibration thing.
"
cadillac,cts,2018,Jeffrey Gilmore, 07/13/2019,Outstanding Value for the $$,5,"This is the fourth Cadillac I have purchased.  I traded in my 2014 XTS because I needed AWD in the climate I live in now.  I compared the Audi A6 to the Cadillac CTS.  While the A6 had a little more interior room, the CTS has more standard features for less money.  
Stay away from the turbo 4.  It is noisy, unrefined and weak.  The 3.0 V6 is quick and smoooooth.  
The ride and handling is decidedly sporty.  Part of this is due to the AWD system and run-flat tires.  Ditch the run-flats for some all season radials and a ""donut"" spare.  Tire noise goes away and your ride will be much smoother.  Even still, it rides smoother than the A6.
I LOVE throwing this car through the curves.  Confident precise steering keeps the tires planted, well balanced, thanks to the 50/50 weight distribution.
Inside, quality materials abound: a standard feature on all the Cadillacs I've owned.  Seats are comfortable for extended periods of time.  Front leg room abounds (I'm 6'4) although rear legroom is less than my larger XTS.  Touch sensitive controls work great, but are great as a finger-print capturing device.  
I HIGHLY reccomend you purchase a CTS.  The few gripes I have are outweighed by the quality, handling, smoothness and satisfying luxury experience that comes from owning this car.  This CTS is the best balance of luxury, sportiness, and value for the $$ of any Cadillac I have owned.
If possible, purchase a low mileage CPO.  You will save tons of $$ for the same experience as a new model.

cadillac,cts,2019,MMiller, 03/02/2020,One of the best sport sedans available,5,"I have now owned two CTS V-Sports (2016 and 2019). The 2019 is the last year for this car and the reason I went ahead and traded my 2016 in for the 2019. In my opinion after driving Audi's, BMW's and Mercedes the CTS-V-Sport is one of the best luxury sport sedan over the last 10 years. The CTS won the Motor Trend Car of the year in 2014 largely due to the V-
Sport. The V-Sport is not like any other CTS. It has its own Asian 8 speed transmission that is amazingly smooth which is not available in any other Cadillac/CTS. The 420 hp twin turbo V-6 produces plenty of power. Road feel and handling are on par with my previous favorite the 1997-2003 BMW 5 series. In regards to the infotainment system the updated CUE system (since 2016) is one of the best especially when put together with Apple Car Play. It is much better than the I drive system in my wife's 2019 X-5 or the systems I have used in Audi's and Mercedes.  I've not tried the system in a Lexus but why? Only people who don't enjoy driving and  have no taste (a grill only a mother could love) drive Lexus.
The  CTS V-sport really does bring back ""Standard of the World"" for Cadillac. Too bad Cadillac didn't market this car better or price it more competitively new. They are great deals used (certified preowned) but were about $10,000 too expensive new.

have owned 6 BMW's and this is the 
best value for the money. I thought 
very highly of the Bimmers but they 
are way overpriced for what you get 
compared to the ""V"". Cadillac did 
their homework on this one and will go 
far on this series. 

I was going to buy this car as an 
investment, but after the test drive 
it is my car of choice to drive not

car for about three months, and read 
all the reviews. The styling is great, 
but the drivetrain is spectacular. It 
rides great, looks great, and has all 
the luxuries! Well done Cadillac!"
cadillac,cts-v,2004,EricJ, 03/31/2004,Wow!! What a car!!,5,"Just bought it, drove 1400 mi first 
week, only 1 ticket.  Better than I 
hoped.  I've never bought a car in this 
category before, so I'm glad I waited 
until this ""family-friendly"" model came 
out.  My youngest kids (11, 9, and 6) 
fit just fine in back and love it; I 
let my 15-yr old boy drive it a bit - 
now he's ruined and wants his own.  I 
hit .95 g a couple of times and just 
love the way it hugs the road on tight 
turns!"

midsize sedan. Very satisfactory 
handling in an American sedan."
cadillac,cts-v,2004,M G S, 04/08/2004,About Time,4," Finally Cadillac gets into the Game. 
Although not a high tech barnstormer, 
yet a vehicle that I've enjoyed 
immensely. It feels very confident when 
driven and braking. There were no 
noticable bad habits in the vehicle. 
This is a pure drivers car with little 
reliance on gimmicks or electronics. 
The seats are comfortable and easily 
adjustable. This car is comfortable for 
the short hop as well as the long haul. 
A very pleasant surprise. If this car 
doesn't make car of the year, it'll be 
a crime. This car represents everything 
that auto mags scream for. This car 
delivers."
cadillac,cts-v,2004,Mogul, 04/21/2004,Muscle Car,5,"This is one great car, the engineers 
should be congratulated for putting 
this car together.  It's so much fun 
to drive. The engine sounds are worth 
the price of the car. I have a bad 
fuel guage, ran out of gas second day 
with 1/8 of tank indicating."
cadillac,cts-v,2004,Pneubird, 04/28/2004,ITS A V,4,"This is a drivers car!! Handling like 
you wouldn't believe. Tachs up to 6500 
RPMs so fast you better not take your 
eyes off the tach or you will float the 
valves at 6800 RPMs. My only grip is 
the throw from first to second. Its a 
bit long. Rice burners beware!! I have 
already dusted a few and have 3 
speeding tickets to prove it!!"

two weeks, it's everything that the 
auto magazine reviewers said it was--
and then some.  I get the same 
sensation driving this that I did 
driving a Nascar racer at the Richard 
Petty school in Orlando--except this 
looks better and is a lot more 
comfortable.  I wish I could take 
credit for designing it since there are 
so many things in it that I would have 
wanted--and they're there."

drive.  The clutch is very tight.

this one, and I must say I am 
delighted. The deficiencies of the M-3 
(5 speed tranny, tiny rearview mirrors, 
small back seat legroom) are but a 
distant memory. I was able to drive 
them back to back for 3 weeks while I 
sold the M-3 on ebay.  More torque, 
more gears, better brakes, better 
handling. A level of luxury I was not 
accustomed to in the M-3. Auto seats on 
key removal, auto lights, GPS, fabulous 
sound system, killer XM radio.  The 
only drawback? You'll need deep pockets 
at the pump."

RIDE of a cadillac.
The GM team has taken the cadillac to 
the next level of performance.  This 
car is something very special and fun 
to drive. "
cadillac,cts-v,2004,geneno, 07/05/2004,Heck of a car!!!,4,"I traded in a 2002 Z06 for this ride, 
which was tough to do because the 
Corvette was a known entity (lots of 
fun). The Z06 is a good knife fighter. 
If you want to take a short trip and 
attack the roads, this is the car. 
However, if you want all the Z06 has 
to offer and more, then the CTS-V 
takes the mantle. I spent 10 hours in 
the CTS-V recently and when I got home 
I wanted to drive some more...nuff 
said."
cadillac,cts-v,2004,2cme, 08/08/2004,brand new,4,"This vehicle came loaded, it is 
difficult to understand how to program 
the navigator, hook up the phone, etc.  
The steering wheel does not telescope 
which can be a problem if there are 
going to be muti-sized individuals 
using the car, and the front console 
plastic can be uncomfortable for some 
men when their legs splay open and the 
knee hits it."
cadillac,cts-v,2004,kit, 09/15/2004,loads of fun,4,"The CTSV will have you reliving the 
muscel cars era or in some cases make 
you wish you were there.  With traction 
control and stabilitrak the V is much 
more forgiving than its predecessors 
but the neat thing is you can turn off 
the traction and stabilitrak and get 
wild. You can 26 mpg on the hwy if you 
keep your foot out of it. If you love 
to drive you will love this car, the 6 
speed takes a little getting use to but 
once you have it down you can't wait to 
get in and go.  The V handels as good 
as it goes, I have reached 1.00 g 
without the feeling of pushing the 
envolope.  The nav system is great, no 
more maps or looking for gas and hotels."

this car!"
cadillac,cts-v,2004,chiptractor, 12/07/2004,Corvette for the kids,4,"This vehicle is fun to drive fast, and 
it does not attract undue attention. 
The acceleration is very strong, 
allowing you to make passes like a 
motorcycle, and the brakes are very 
effective. Handling controls allow you 
to throw it around without concern, 
and you can turn them off if you 
really want to get sideways. You can 
sell it to your wife as a nice 
sensible family sedan if you keep it 
quiet when she's onboard.  "

am a German car snob. My most recent 
car was a 2001 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG. I have 
also had a BMW 540i, Porsche 996, Porsche 993,
etc. This car really takes the cake. It is VERY fast, 
handles great and rides stiff but not too much so.
The motor makes power everywhere.
You are in 4th and roll up 
to a stop sign - no problem the torque 
will pull you away from a dead stop. 
You are always in the right gear. 
Kudos to the overdrive gear. At 75mph 
you are barely turning 2,000 rpm so I 
often get nearly 27 MPG. The seats are 
comfortable, although they could use 
more lateral support. The brakes are 
the best I have ever had on a 4 door 
car. GM really got this one right. Thanks 
to Bob Lutz. I do not miss the E55."
cadillac,cts-v,2004,Greg Millard, 09/05/2006,G's CTS-V,4,"I ordered this car six months before it was available.  I grew anxious and impulse and bought a new Volvo S060R which was very nice but one drive of the 'V' and back went the Volvo to the dealership the S60 went, costing me over $5,000 for five weeks ownership.  That is a lot of money, but the CTS- V is definetely a car with a soul that does was you want when you want and was well worth paying for my mistake.  If fuel economy is your reason d'etre this is not your car.  If however, high lateral grip, stupendous braking and ulta quick acceleration are on your list of priorities, you need look no further.  And, it's Made in the USA. "
cadillac,cts-v,2004,Dennis, 03/17/2007,Great Non-Family Car,4,"I love my CTS-V.  It is comfortable to drive and fun to drive HARD into turns.   It has perfect balance.  The only problem is paint rubbing off of the radio knobs and a rear end bearing failure.  It has lots of wheel hop on a hard standing start, especially on wet pavement.  I want a new '07 or '08 because of the 100,000 mile warranty.  I plan to buy another one as soon this one's goes out of warranty.."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Former M5 Owner, 01/27/2007,Get Rid of the Bimmer,4,As a previous Porsche Boxster and BMW M5 owner I was skeptical about an American-made CADILLAC for myself (40-year old former European-make snob) to satisfy my craving for a family sedan and performance vehicle that didn't break my kid's college fund. It blew me away on the test drive.  Its 400hp matched my M5 and shifting was a breeze. Its handling is excellent. I would recommend this car to any M5 owner who is looking for an alternative.  
cadillac,cts-v,2005,mamma24, 06/29/2010,Racing Family,5,"Love our cts-v, 6 speed, 5.7, 4 door! Fun to drive, looks HOT and holds 3 kids in the backseat! Can't complain about the mpg, getting 22 when we drive easy! Always run 91 in it too! Wouldn't trade it, after 2 years, even with my 'cons' below! Tinted the windows in solar guard 5%. Exhaust is not loud enough for me. Putting flowmasters on soon. Always turns heads everywhere we go as it is!"
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Fast Businessman, 09/26/2006,Perfect Mix Between Business & Pleasure,4,"I bought the CTS-V to replace my adolescent-looking '04 Mustang GT.

cadillac,cts-v,2005,logun, 05/17/2012,over a year ownership (happy),4,"bought my V with 49k on it in 2011. Performance is outstanding. It is F-A-S-T, saying that I don't abuse the car, but I have pushed the gas a few times.
It corners well.
The rear differential is crap. I cant say that enough. Huge fail point for GM. 2ndly the gear shift is crap as well. Designed after the BMW type shifter. It's vague & has a looong throw to it. Nothing like muscle car coupes of GM & Ford. Overall I do enjoy the car, it's definitely fun to drive & easy to pass folks. My suspension is nice & stiff, it will jar your kidneys on bumps.
LOTS of power, sucks the gas if you lay into it.
Decent mileage, City is aroud 16 mpg & hwy it's been up to 27mpg at 70 mph. 21mpg @ 85-90mph"

The car has outstanding overall performance in an austere yet functional ad attractive cockpit. To those who think the drink holders should be larger:buy a different car.  I had the computer ""custom blueprinted"" and removed the 1-4th gear interlock in the computer program.  The car runs well with Michelin Pilot Sport tires"
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Tim, 08/10/2010,A Corvette for those of us with kids,4,"First, I own a 2005 CTS-V, essentially this means my 400HP comes from a 5.7 L Aluminum block instead of a 6.0 L one..that difference notwithstanding, the vehicles are nearly identical.  First, this is an amazing vehicle, and can be had at a reasonable price.  I purchased mine and it still has a full MasterGuard GMPP Warranty.  For those of you who are looking at CTS-V's, I would recommend post 2005, as the 05's have rear differential issues that were addressed with an updated P/N in 06 (mine has been replaced).  I get many positive comments on my black V, and she begs to be driven rough.  The 6 speed is phenomenal, if a little bulky in traffic.  Very smooth, very dignified, and fits the family"
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Bill S, 11/05/2006,"2005 CTS-V, Top Notch",4,"My experience with BMWs is not good. Lots of trouble, lots of cost.  I've had this Cadillac CTS-V for 22 months and have put 30,000 miles on it.  I have never replaced the tires or had a warranty item.  I do use snow tires from November to March and I rotate them at 5,000 mile intervals . My 350Z has been a disaster with tires and radios (3 sets of tires and 3 radios).  My car still has no loose anything after 30,000 miles, but it takes some skill to drive this car.  It's not for every one."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,rocdoc, 10/10/2006,Buy German!,2,"Had a Bmw M3 before this and have had multiple ""hot rods."" The build quality of the CTS-V is pathetic, as is the handling, even with the ""handling package."" I've had it in the shop a ton.  I even got so tired of dealing with it that I'd wait until I had a few warranty items ""saved up"" so as to avoid more frequent visits. The depreciation is also horrible compared to a comparable foreign model- do not buy!"
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Gary Mossner, 02/07/2006,Awesome Fun,4,"I like my Cadillac CTS-V as much as my Corvette. The looks of astonishment that I get from Mustangs and BMW's are hilarious. They can't believe it is a Cadillac. Which it is, my first and certainly not my last. It handles like it's on rails. I had the G meter pegged out at .95 and it was effortless and held the corner tightly with hardly any tail movement."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,cliff, 03/27/2006,Wow,4,This is the most enjoyable car to drive and what a bargain for what you receive. I have on occasion pushed the car to the limit and it will blow you away as well as most other cars on the road. it suprises everyone. Take a bow Cadillac for this one.
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Larry L. Blagman, 07/23/2006,CTS - Very Good,4,"I have had my CTS-V for 13 months. It has been the most reliable and pleasurable car that I have ever had. I would think that with all the features that this car has that something would have had a minor problem. I haved had nothing go wrong. It had had the oil changed every 3,000 miles and that Is it.   The performance is first rate and the handling is excellent. I get praise about this car wherever I go. It is an attention getter.  My average mile per gallon is 15 mpg. I think that this is good considering the car's performance. I will definately buy another CTS-V when the new model comes out."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Rmildenberger, 07/15/2006,2005 Cadillac CTS-V,4,"I was intrigued by the Cadillac performance vehicle.  I am not the least bit sorry that I bought it.  My wife drives a Corvette, and I prefer the Cadillac.  I haven't had any trouble with the vehicle and has been in the shop only for routine service.  If there was a complaint, it would have to be the Goodyear tires that came on the vehicle.  The tires were wonderful, but the replacement cost was very high.  I replaced the tires at 11,000 miles.  Would buy another CTS-V."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,ElSanchez, 08/13/2006,CTS=V Z06,4,"For the heart of a Corvette, this thing still gets great mileage and is extremely civil.  But when I open it up, it's a whole different beast."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,YoungVP, 02/27/2007,Fun at Last,4,"Finally an American rear drive that has plenty of horsepower. I have been waiting for something that gave me what my old BMW 540 had. This is much more reliable and cheaper to own. Plus, it's got all the American muscle that I have missed for many years! It is a great car.  I will be buying the '08 model with 500 HP when it comes out."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Renesis 83, 05/19/2009,A true 4 Door Vette,4,"I have owned several muscle cars over the years and this one truly lives up to the standard, the handeling is great and the torque is available at any speed. Its a sleeper and the car is very under rated and there are few of these produced. All I can say is that 0-60 under 5 seconds and qtr miles in 13 seconds flat from a 3800lbs car is great. Also this one handles great and the steering reponse is excellent. Get rid of the runflat tires and you ll get your self and excellent highway cruiser. why over pay for an M5 when you can get this. I am very satisfied with the car and plan to keep it for years to come. Good work GM performance division. Also looking on 2010 camaro SS and 08 Gt500"

cadillac,cts-v,2005,Jim Hastings, 05/09/2006,Not Good,2,"During my first month of ownership the radio had to be replaced.  The keyless entry quit working after 6 months. Also, a ""thud"" noise when applying the brakes had to be fixed - I am still not sure what that was. The design is too low to the ground, maybe reason that the ""plastic"" front strip became lose and I ran it over it. The engine has power but it is not equally distrubuted the over wheel base thus the reason for the ""black"" soot on my chrome wheels.  It makes the car look like it hasn't been cleaned in months.  I thought the car looked really good but it is definitely not worth the money for all the little quirks that need to be worked out.  This is the last GM that I'll buy."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Ian, 08/12/2007,One problem after another,2,"This car is fast in a straight line, but that's about it. The differential is a poorly designed component that can't handle the power the motor puts out.  I had the car a little over a year, and had to have it replaced once, and serviced for leaking twice. The suspension is OK, but it still drives like a large car.  A lot of other things had to be repaired/replaced under warranty.  Do not buy this car if the warranty is close to running out!"

cadillac,cts-v,2005,cheesemonger, 03/11/2009,Hmmmmn,3,"Car runs fine, no problems of serious nature. Just it seems to be not well thought out. Simple thing, how can a car in this price range not have a central lock gas cover or at least an interior release for the gas cover? The navigation system is better than the BMW iDrive but that is a pretty low bar to beat. If l could take the computer tower out, it would improve my feelings a lot. l am stupid enough not to be able to change the name of previous owner so shut off personalization and now have no memory for seats. Cannot change clock, not a computer guy, a car guy yes, but too much computer issues."

This car is a quantum leap in feel and power.  My drives seem shorter, because it is such fun to drive I hate to arrive.  I like it's stealth Corvette quality.  I bought this car used with 40,000 miles on it and it looks like new except for a small fleck of finish missing from one of the Nav system buttons.  I get lots of complements from  people who know what it is and those who don't.  Total thrill to step on it and work through the gears and step down into a set of twisties."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,400HPLS6, 04/15/2005,Excellent car,5,"The CTS-V is amazing.  This is one American car that can compete with the best the Germans build.  The V is a rocket, a luxury rocket.  This is not a car to drive if you prefer boring rides.  If you love excitement, the V is the answer.  If things like shifting for yourself, or 400 hp scares you, then it is not."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Engineer Geoff, 06/09/2005,Geoff's CTS-V,4,"If GM made more cars like this, they wouldn't be in trouble.  I have 3500 miles on my 2005 CTS-V, half of it being wide open interstate and half in the doldrums of Los Angeles commuter traffic.  This car replaces a highly modified Jaguar XJS-V12, and I am generally delighted with the move.  The Cadillac handling is hard to fault, and selective turn off of stability and traction is welcome. I am less pleased with straight line performance, as the vehicle is subject to axle tramp unless care is taken to avoid it.  Also, engine management slowly (over seconds) decreases rpm on release of throttle which makes for an odd feel on hard acceleration.  DIC is distracting and features ill thought out."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,ZOOM, 06/12/2005,Driving The V ZO6,5,"Driving the ""V"" is an adventure I look forward to every day. It's all whats been said and some so smoothly.

cadillac,cts-v,2005,stewarth, 06/23/2005,6 months review,4,"Having just clocked 12,000 miles in 6 months in the V, I have to say that I am thrilled to be the owner of this Z06 in sheeps clothing.  What more could you ask for, neck snapping power, comfort, handling and great looks.  I don't baby this thing. In April I put over 60 laps of hard driving at Road Atlanta going almost 130 on the back stretch in fourth. I even did a 180 in the first turn.  Even in competitve driving mode the stability control activated and worked to perfection in getting the car under control.  My friends were impressed by my driving skills.  (If they only knew).   The car never disappoints. 3,300 miles on the Power Tour and not one problem. Wore out the tires though."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Gary, 06/24/2005,Great Value,4,"Faster than a BMW 545, more comfortable that an M5, and thousands less than both, this is a great value if you like to drive fast in comfort.  Handles very well, sound system is great, and seats are comfortable, yet firm enough to work.  This is a very good competitor to BMW 5 series, which I used to own.  The interior is spartan.  This is a performance car, not a a luxury car, although the creature comforts are excellent. You just don't feel like you're in an expensive luxury car.  If driving is your objective, then you have to try this car. I would like a quieter, smoother transmission, that doesn't force you into 4th gear at certain speeds."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,pumbathane, 07/10/2005,Speed Thrills!,4,"I love my V! I was a bit apprehensive about having a six speed manual, as I live in a large city and spend time in stop and go traffic. No problem. The CTS-V handles, shifts, and runs great. The clutch is easy without being too mushy. My previous toy was a 2001 Mercedes C32 AMG. The Mercedes was fast, but I got tired of the lag that comes with supercharged engines. I also got tired of visiting my local Mercedes dealer regularly for engine repairs.  The V has great low end torque, courtesy of its' 400 hp eight cylinder, handles incredibly well, and sings sweet burble music via the exhaust. For a car guy,this is heaven!"
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Papa Tom, 07/10/2005,Grandma's new V,5,"Excellent car in everyway, it's amazing that the economy is there with the performance and comfort.  Best buy for the dollar. Grandma really enjoys her new car.  The Ecalade was nice but this is better."
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Richie T, 07/23/2005,Woo Hoo! This is Too Much Fun,4,"I was ready for something new, fast, and American. This car fit the bill perfectly. The GM Employee pricing plan currently in effect made it an absolute no brainer! Coming from a 2003 Mercedes SL500 (which had constant electrical issues) I was really wondering if I could be happy with this car. I love it. Naturally, this is a car that would only appeal to certain drivers. The suspension is stiff, the handling is fantastic (18 inch wheels with run flat tires, active suspension), the 14 inch Brembo brakes stop the car well, the 6 speed Getrag designed transmission and differential all make this car feel like something other than your Grandma's Cadillac. Overall, I am obviously THRILLED!"
cadillac,cts-v,2005,v-guy, 01/20/2006,The V,4,"The Cadillac CTS-V is the cat's meow!  I purchased it as more of a trophy to take out on nice days and when I needed some adreneline and man does this machine have it!  I love everything about it, and best of all it's American!  Anyone looking for a well built, unbelievably quick machine should consider the V!"
cadillac,cts-v,2005,Mace Carpenter, 06/18/2004,Car Rocks,4,"The car is absolutely outstanding!  The 
power is awesome, the handling is 
great, the feautures are near perfect, 
and the support from the dealer is 
superb.  I recommend this car.  The CTS-
V easily matches or exceeds in 
performance, features, and quality with 
similar vehicles from Lexus, Mercedes, 
Jaguar & BMW.  However, the CTS-V is 
$20,000-30,000 dollars less expensive 
than what you would have to spend with 
the other companies.  Awesome ride...  "

still more comfortable.  The stereo is 
much better.  The car has no major

It gets over 26 mpg on the highway at 65 mph on cruise control. At the same time this is a family car. It seats five, and has lots of leg room in back seat. The back seat also goes down so that I can fit skis, snow boards, and hockey sticks. I have three big boys and definitely need this extra space.  I looked at BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz E55, Mazda, Volvo and read all car magazines. The CTS-V is the one with a soul."

cadillac,cts-v,2005,babylou, 08/07/2005,World Class,4,"This car is truly world class once the shifter is changed to one made by UUC Motorwerks.  It is not so over- ""refined"", ala Lexus or Mercedes AMG, that it is boring.  The only competitor in its size class that is as fun is the BMW M5.  Build quality is great.  Cadillac reliability stats are impressive.  All for a 30% lower price and better reliability than a BMW M5, MB E55 AMG, etc."

cadillac,cts-v,2005,Zip, 10/02/2005,CTSV - Slick American,4,"The one issue I have is the torque reversal noise when shifting at low speeds - it's normal but annoying.  Such power needs to flex.

The engine has tons of power, the car looks great with the 18"" wheels and slightly flared fenders.  This first couple times I drove it, I just laughed, the power is so plentiful.  This car is downright fast.  I get thumbs up from people who are ""in the know"" about this car.  I got the Red Line color.  At first I liked black the best, but I really think this is the best color on the V.  I'm happy this car only comes with a 6-speed manual transmission, as several ""non car-guy"" types have bellyached to me about the ""need for an automatic"".  No way.  If you can't shift, get a STS-V or a Mercedes-Benz.  This is a modern day muscle car."

cadillac,cts-v,2005,Jim, 03/28/2016,2005 CTS V,5,"I’ve had it for 3 years now. I changed the springs and put harder rear bushings on the V to deter wheel hop.The differential was making noise (a version 1 malady), so I put a Creative Steel Ford 8.8 diff kit in it. I autocrossed it last season in FS (SCCA Solo), and took a 3rd for the season against “Works” Minis and other small cars. Not bad for such a large heavy car. It’s comfy and has “cool factor”.

cadillac,cts-v,2006,shannon, 11/08/2010,Long term Review - Very Important,3,"After owning the car for a couple of years. Here is a review that might be useful to some. Having driven both engines Ls2 and Ls6. I would say that Ls6 is a tick faster on the top end. The car is Daily driver and is good fun as an American car can be. After owning several GM built cars over the years, I will now consider another brand just because competitors have built superior cars. V is not very thought out. The shifter is terrible - too much effort. The suspension is not forgiving. This car is not on the same level as the AMG and M5. They are fast and comfortable and driver feels connected to the car. with this, it feels like you are in a substandard product."
cadillac,cts-v,2006,estrellazero, 08/19/2008,Awesome Cadillac,4,"If you enjoy a smooth ride with the amenities of a luxury vehicle, but enjoy what a 400 hp LS2 engine can do to exercise your lead foot - then this is a car for you.  It's a super car that can be drive for comfort, convenience, but for sport and performance! Enjoy responsibly!"
cadillac,cts-v,2006,cred, 04/02/2010,Amazing CTS-V,4,"Break Neck quick and lots of fun. The interior has much to be desired, not bad but not as high of quality as competitive vehicles. Plastic sunshades and dash seem cheap. The comfort and room is good however and the features are relatively easy to use. Fuel economy is excellent for a sub 5 second 0 - 60 mph car. Ride is tight and handling is excellent for a performance sedan... but soft enough for a comfortable ride."
cadillac,cts-v,2006,Guy Patterson, 01/05/2006,Performance and Value,4,The 2006 Cadillac CTS-V is a truly wonderful car that was cross shopped against the Volvo S60R and an Acura RL.  If you want BMW M-Series performance at an affordable price buy this car.

The price is excellent compared for the foreign competition.  I've found that the more I drive it, the more I like it.  I own a C5 Corvette and I can tell you that the CTS-V is fast, but it does not feel as fast as my vette.  We will have to take it to the track to tell.  I love the exterior styling.  I love the smoothness of the ride...the suspension is perfect.  The ride is quiet.  The radio is awesome.  The interior toys are great.  I love the sound of the engine.  Keep in mind you are purchasing a 400hp car so it will not be quiet as a mouse, but the sound level is just right.  This car gets an A+ for the money!"

It is such a great all around car, I'm ditching my toy Porsche b/c I just don't drive it anymore.  Also, its faster, but cops don't seem to notice it and the ""fast & furious"" import jet set is apparently oblivious -- I have waxed more kids in imports than I can count in just the last two months.

The interior could be better, but the engine - and the exhaust - sings the perfect tune that you get to forget everything else in the world.  The displays are well done, handling is incredible especially running away from curves. The passenger room is spacious. Just in case you are able to find a few freaks who are willing to take the passenger seat on this beast.  Overall this car is too good to be true."

I've took the monster on a cross country trip last summer with my girl. we've had a blast. the navigation, big sunroof, nice stereo, and the 6.0 under the hood. The manual transmission is so easy to handle - thanks to high torque. The V is so much fun to drive, I can't help drive it at least 500miles a week (and my work is only 5 miles from home). The four door sedan doesn't get any attention from the police or the traffic. But there is hardly any car on the road above this 400 hp beauty and the beast. And the compliments I get from cops while I am parked is out of this world."

Highway on ramps are fun and the underpass noise gives you a rush. I feel like a high school kid again. I have every dealer performance option I in can get. The skip shift has to go. A MSG transmission with paddle shift, and the heads up display would be more fun."

In addition to the excellent performance, I can fit a wife and three kids in it very comfortably! The only downside I have found so far, is the skip shift wins the award for most annoying feature on a car ever.  Although not a big deal, the location of the cup holders interferes with the position of your shifting arm after those trips to Dunkin' Donuts."
cadillac,cts-v,2007,xmustanger, 11/11/2010,Love this car!,4,Got this car a few days ago and love it so far! Never thought i could have so much fun in a 4 door sedan.

Dealer installed performance exhaust, skip shifter and upgraded suspension....each worth the added expense, particularly if you like to hear an engine that growls. Obviously, does not handle like a 911, but at 60% of the price it is worth giving up a little. "

cadillac,cts-v,2007,Wise One, 09/11/2007,Scary Fast,4,Excellent vehicle and more power for the money than most out there. Car is a real head turner as people initially think it is a regular CTS until they get a little closer and then only see your tailights. Also handles amazingly well for a large vehicle. On the highway very quiet and smooth until you need the power.
cadillac,cts-v,2007,robuc1, 10/23/2007,Wow!,4,"This is hands down the best dollar for dollar auto purchase I have ever made. I've owned 911's, Mercedes, late '60's muscle cars, etc.  this one wins the lot!  It'll beat almost anything on the road (I added the Cadillac sanctioned magna-supercharger), and literally, it's hard to keep on the road!  I've had it dynoed at the neighbourhood shop at 440hp at the rear wheel..yup, rear wheel.  You will not be disappointed with this machine. It's an ol' man's muscle car...power, looks, comfort, sound."

Also the differential clanks loudly and the dealer says this is normal. Lightning fast, good brakes. Interior too much plastic. "
cadillac,cts-v,2007,james smith, 03/19/2008,Fuel Mileage,4,I am very much disappointed with gas mileage. I had a 2004 cts that got 28.2 mpg and my 2007 gets maybe 23.5 mpg I live in Texas and I'm 71 yrs old

I drove it expecting to be disappointed. 8 months later I'm still riding V-crazy! Amazing power; great looking (pictures cant do it justice); and at half the price of other supercars that absolutely can not compare. More horse power than most cars in the industry, especially sedans. This car can lift my 350+ pound can out the seat! I am pleased.  "
cadillac,cts-v,2007,Car lover, 10/25/2008,Better than my 2 Corvettes,4,"Love the acceleration of the 400 horses.  The 6 speed is the same as my last Corvette so the first to fourth shifting wasn't as annoying as it could've been.  Like the cornering. Wife won't drive it because she thinks the suspension is too stiff - that's a bonus for me.  The added seats over a Corvette really make me not want another Corvette.  I've gotten 25 mpg on the highway and it's a nice ride on interstates.  Great sound system and the navigation system is useful.  XM radio is convenient in getting sports games in the middle of nowhere. OK, now that Corvettes are made with over 600 horses, I guess I'd try one. But not for 100K+. Best car I've ever had, hands down!"

Believe me when I say this car has more torque and is more fun to drive than all of the above, and it does it all with great style and comfort."
cadillac,cts-v,2009,Jmos77, 11/02/2009,Incredible Sleeper,4,I just traded my M3 for the CTS-V and the car is simply amazing.  THe power and torque are scary at times and the magnetic suspension offers a perfect balance of comfort and touring.  This is by far the fastest car I have ever owned so be prepared to buy a radar detector for keeping this car at speed is impossible.  The biggest surprise for me is how beautiful the interior is.  The hand stiched dash and the ambient light along with the skyview sunroof makes for a fantastic place to spend time.  The fit and finish are very surprising as well and I love the white diamond paint on my car. Bottom line GM hit a homerun and if you need a 4 fast sedan then look no further.  Can't beat the price too
cadillac,cts-v,2009,Chris, 01/20/2009,American Know How,4,"This car is great, luxury, features, performance, roomy and did I mention performance. The ride is very smooth and controlled no mater how you drive it. It is not as loud as you might expect from a performance sedan and just a joy to drive. The quality is as good as you can get and I have found no problems with it.  The performance is off the scale, the Recarro seats are fantastic and the interior is well layed out and functional, not to mention beautiful.  I have gotten an average of 11.4 MPG since I bought it but this is not a hybrid. This is my dream car, thanks Cadillac for making my dream come true and providing such a great example of ""Good Ol American Know How""."
cadillac,cts-v,2009,JFJr, 01/15/2009,Ultimate high performance luxury sedan,4,"This car has set the standard for high performance luxury sedans, regardless of price.

Car is a blast, but traction is an issue, even in 104 degree weather. Just have to get over the fact that you can't floor it in 1st or 2nd in any weather without blowing the tires completely. 3rd gear hooks up in 90+ degree weather, and we'll see about cooler days this fall! Interior is very nice, but there is a bit more interior noise than in an audi I owned. 14-15 MPG average really isn't that bad for a 600HP sedan. Gadgets are very nice. The 8 inch nav touch screen is impressive. Excellent toy if scaring three passengers on the way to lunch is your cup of tea!"

I will likely keep this car forever. "

I bought the loaded Reacaro version with an automatic and I can tell you: this car is the real deal. It is a beast on the road and a beauty to behold. Loaded with luxury, handles lke a much lighter car, and will simply plant your head and body in the back of your seat whenever you ask. Here's a little secret: the ZR-1 engine is in this pup. You can easily get this engine to produce way more horsepower. In fact GM built it in such a way that it almost begs to be upgraded. A pulley here, new headers and cat back there, tune the tranny and engine, and there is nothing under 100k that can catch this car. Buy if you dare."

Guess which one is faster and more powerfull, but not quite as slick looking - just by a little bit?  There is not a Beamer or Mercedes worth the 30 to 40k more I'd be willing to pay for their prestige.  Besides the Corvette Touring Sedan -V looks much cooler that either of them, especially out of my rear view mirror.  Been there done that many times before and they flat out ain't worth it.

Power, speed, and control at levels unheard of with a production line manufactured 4 door sedan - bar none!  Then there are the looks.  Talk about a phallic symbol on a testosterone high.

I am NOT sorry I bought this car four months and 4500 miles ago, trading up from my beloved Acura RL.  It lives up to EVERY bit of hype heaped upon it in the auto media.  It is FAST, it is QUIET inside, the interior is high-quality, and the car is STEALTHY in that cops won't notice this car AT ALL.  The torque is everywhere you want it to be.  There are few buttons and they are large and intuitive.  I didn't buy the car for gas mileage but it sure could use another gallon in the tank.  Range is 240 miles in mixed 50-50 city/freeway driving, less when fooling around."

I cannot comment on reliability, yet, but I can tell you that you should NOT test-drive it unless there is a chance that you can afford to buy it. My test drive took 20 minutes with a smiling sales guy pressed into the seat and it was the most visceral and yet sublime experience I ever had in an automobile.  External styling, interior, engine, suspension, brakes, steering feel, infotainment system...everything is a work of art. Cadillac absolutely hit a home-run and may have made the finest American car ever."

Have been watching this car prior to ever purchasing the M3 but needed more space - so I made the move.  Looks are terrific and simply unparralled by the competition.  What I did notice about this car is the obvious thrust / torque that goes with its monster engine.  But I noticed that the car starts to handle and steer better as you increase speed.  The suspension seems to set-up better, steering more response and crisp.  My only grip is (don't forget, coming out of M3) is that there are a lot more creeks and noices coming from interior parts and the seats.  Great car for GM, yes, DNA of the best cars on the road, not yet. "

The electronics are pretty complex to me since I have driven my Honda Accord for 12 years. I read a little bit every night to understand the electronics of the CTS V.

I am very impressive by the features but need to return to dealership to have some trim items tightened up. Slightly smaller steering wheel like the sie in my Evo X Mr that I traded would be perfect.

Driven everyday as a daily driver, but has the capability to be taken very seriously on a track or closed high speed course. Think of it as a 4 door Corvette with a back seat and trunk. The Magnetic Ride Control suspension and selectable Comfort/Sport and (4) StabiliTrack settings work like a dream. BMW owners with Sport Packages would likely keep it set to Sport mode and not notice any harsh or bumpy ride. Designed by GM Performance group and utilizes many Corvette ZR-1 parts.

I am a very good driver and no heavy foot driving.  2010 CTS is 200 lbs heavier apparently, and to me the weight difference was noticable immediately. Handles well, good steering, good traction.  Lacking head room; interior roof line is low. I like to drive sitting quite high so as to overlook the front end, but a tall person could have difficulty.  Also the curvature of the top of the door line at the frame means I have to duck well to avoid hitting my head. So far that is my only complaint.  I am a REALTOR so I have to know my vehicle is reliable. This is my fifth Cadillac since 1985."

I switched from my 750i BMW to this car.  Before the BMW I had an AMG E55 Mercedes and both those cars were great.  I drove the new E63 AMG and the M5 before deciding on the Caddy.  I have put 2000 miles on the car and it really is a great car.  Everything works, the car looks great, nice fit and finish.  The engine just has a nice rumble and everything works with no drama.  Just press the gas pedal and hang on!  Handling reminds of my Porsche, just a tight nice ride and it loves the hills.  A GREAT value for such a world class car.  No regrets at all.  "

Every morning when I switch on the light in the garage, I am still thrilled to own this car.  This car is the ultimate sleeper as only ""car people"" know what it is.  I've taken it to the drag strip, and it's actually faster than my Vette, it ran a 12.1, completely stock!  Have I mentioned handling?  I love the way this car attacks corners.

Its a dream to handle in part because its impressively powerful. It speeds up, slows down, turns corners and does everything very, very well, and of course, its very powerful. Its better than any of the pony cars Ive owned or the Vetts or the imported sports cars. Its better than the BMW it replaced.  Its gorgeous inside and out.

The ride is plush, with a rocket for a motor and acceleration is just awesome.  I purchased a 2006 SRT 10 Ram ""Viper powered"" new and added aftermarket products.  Although the truck is awesome for acceleration and handling, it has nothing on the CTS-V.  Both are eye catchers but the CTS-V is a head taller.  Ride, comfort, interior design, music, performance is just outstanding in the V.  If you are ready for the ride of your life, buy one or make friends with someone who has a CTS-V because any seat is the ride of your life. "

Most recently a module of some sort failed leaving steering wheel  controls cruise, radio, paddle shifter inoperable. It was an expensive and time consuming repair. As the problems became completely determined, they were eliminated and the car has been trouble free for more than a year.

If you are lucky to own one of these automobiles consider yourself lucky and blessed.

I say that so that you realize its not designed to be cushy. Its designed for folks that want a Z06 in a sedan package. The only downside is that the Cadillac dealers are not quite as good as say a BMW dealer in attentiveness. Leaps and bounds better than 5 years ago but a little growing to do.

cadillac,cts-v,2017,Brad, 06/24/2020,Cadillac's lack of quality and responsibility,1,"We are on our 3rd Cadillac and our last.   We leased our 3rd CTS V in October of 2017.  11 months remaining on the lease.  The car has been in the Service Dept. at a local Cadillac dealer for 6.2 months out of the last 7 months.  That's 190 days.  Still in the Service Dept.  Needed a new engine at 11600 miles.  In the shop for 68 days that time.  Went right back in for 75 days to repair the damage they did trying to install the new engine the first time.  190 days so far.  Getting a new steering box now because it is shredding the tires.  Three new turbos, one replaced twice. Rear differential module went out also.  We have made all the monthly lease payments to this date.  We have asked Cadillac to take the car back 3 times.  They have refused every time.  Last one was yesterday.  I am gathering all the repair documents along with the VIN # to post so you all can see the quality and commitment to the customer that Cadillac lacks.  They are a big business bully to the small customer.  They know what the right thing to do is and they refuse to do it.  Shame on them and GM for how they treat the consumer.  Posting Docs asap.  This car is a lemon and they know it and will resale it when we turn it back in.  Buyer be ware!!!"
cadillac,cts-v,2019,Anthony, 10/13/2020,Most Fun in a Performance Sedan!!,5,"I’ve always enjoyed driving performance sedans. The writers are always critical of CUE which I’ve actually grown to like once you’re used to it. Although not as polished as some of the European competitors the CTS-V is an amazing car. The balance, performance and exclusivity of the vehicle show when driven. The sound is devilish. Fit and finish is excellent and so far no major issues with 17k miles on the car. Only minor problem was with the transmission. GM has a correction with a multiple flush and different fluid. Resale has always been strong with the V vs it’s competitors and is almost cult like. Recaros are firm but comfortable. Highway gas mileage is excellent for a 640hp car and around town isn’t bad as well since it shuts down to 4cyl. If you’re in the market for an over engineered performance sedan that’s RWD this is the one. Way more fun to drive and reminds me of the old school muscle car days. They’re not easy to find as not many were built. In 2019 only 1055 cars so they are limited. Carbon fiber package makes the car look striking. If you’re in the market for an AMG,S6/7 or M5 check out the V. More reliable and way more fun!!

cadillac,escalade,2000,RJ Howard, 12/08/2005,Love it!,3,"This is my first domestic vehicle in ten years and I do love it.  It has some of the typical GM creaks and such, but nothing major at all.  Also it is a bit low on power, but it is a big truck.  It has been a joy to own."
cadillac,escalade,2000,ealexb, 02/04/2005,Cadillac Escalade,4,"The Cadillac Escalade is identical to a GMC Yukon Denali (the Cadillac of GMC).  It has a suprisingly smooth ride & powerful 350 hp engine.  The interesting thing is the 350 V8 engine seems to get unprecedented gas mileage - approximately 20+ mpg/highway & 16-17 city! This is pretty good for a 6,000 pound truck!  The newer engines are even better on gas, they put the Ford Excursion to shame with its lousy 10 mpg!"

cadillac,escalade,2000,Jason , 11/09/2019,GREAT Tough Truck!,5,"Awesome truck! I bought a 19 year old one with 248,000 miles and the thing starts right up, quiet as a 4 cylinder, and drives as smooth down the road as it did new! I’ve hauled with it, gone off road, and it takes it all like a champ! I get compliments all the time on it. I won’t get rid of it, ever. It’ll be a classic next year and an antique soon after! 

Gas mileage is absolutely acceptable for this size vehicle and engine. 

A few mechanics have told me this is the most reliable model of Escalade. With the 5.7L Vortec V8, same as the Corvette. 

Fun to just cruise! Great on long trips!

get into the back when the doors are

I must admit I was a little scared to drive the big SUV, because it was so much bigger than what I was used to.  When I took my first trip in this Escalade, I was hooked. I LOVE it.

cadillac,escalade,2002,escalade23, 08/05/2010,Best car ever!,4,I wanted one since I was 12 and it's everything and more I dreamed of! The ride is so smooth and luxurious. So quiet the first day I got it. I turned over the key cause I thought it was off. It is like driving an airplane at night. Has every feature you could possible want. The body style is so good Cadillac didn't change it for 5 years. Feel so safe and sound whenever I drive it. Not good on gas but its worth the price. Has a powerful huge engine that can get up and go when you need to. 
cadillac,escalade,2002,AMZ, 02/25/2018,a 2002 in 2018,3,"A few months back my wife totaled my 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid.  It was long paid off and I was enjoying not having a car payment.  Unfortunately, while my wife was fine, my Camry wasn't.  She managed to crease a light pole in the snow in the perfect spot to total the car.  We needed another car and shopped hard.  In the end we picked up a 2002 Cadillac Escalade in Diamond White for approximately $7k out the door from a local dealer's ""super saver"" lot.  Now, ordinarily I'd be leery of buying a 16 year old car, but this one had ""old people"" miles on it at 125k from two previous owners and the carfax showed it had been serviced at the local area chevy/cadi dealers it's entire life. We needed a larger SUV due to two children who are not getting any smaller. Our other car is a 2010 CTS Luxury and while I have never been a GM fan I have to say the past few months have impressed me with the build that went into these SUVs.  We actually jumped on the truck so fast that the dealer hadn't gotten it detailed or cleaned after the auction yet.  No obvious leaks on any of the seals but there were a plethora of Starbucks napkins in the center console.  The motor is the iron block LM7 which is the venerable Vortec pushrod V8.  These things are still out there running at well over 200k+ miles and were used in about everything GM made for the better part of a decade and a half I believe.  Parts are still available all over the place.  The transmission in this truck is pretty bulletproof if the fluids are serviced and this year did not have the air suspension so that added complexity/fail point is thankfully missing.  The vehicle appeared to be garage kept and the paint/chrome was still bright.  Handling and ride are straight old school Cadillac with a floaty ride and effortless steering as numb as your lip after a dentist visit. It's like sitting on your living room couch at 65 mph.  Traction control and ABS are fully functional.  One point we did find was the climate control was on the fritz which is likely why the car had been traded in (in December).  The blend actuator was futzy and the dash only blew hot air while the rear A/C froze your neck.  That was at least about a $500 repair due to the need to take out the entire dash, which the dealer performed before we bought it.  I've seen the same part (which is pretty much unchanged in the last couple decades) futz out in considerably newer GMs.  The only other thing I've found is the mirror control switch is dead but that is an easy fix at $20 and a bit of my time.  While the technology has not held up in terms of obsolescence (have not seen a cassette deck in decade plus and the OnStar doesn't work due to the FCC mandated removal of analog cell) the interior materials, components, and build themselves have.  All the body seals needed a drink of silicone but all were functional.  Mileage is not the greatest but the vehicle is getting about 15mpg combined with mixed highway/city driving so, not bad for a truly full size SUV.  I expect, with continued care and maintenance, to be driving it daily when it enters it's second decade.   I have to say, GM got this one right back in the day.

exceptional.  It seems as if Cadillac 
has risen to the foreign challenge and 
blown them away.  The Escalade is 
priced better than the ML, X5, and 
Range Rover but will outperform them 
anyday."
cadillac,escalade,2002,EDollesin, 05/18/2002,Best SUV,5,"The Escalade is a looker and drives 
like a sports car.  Lots of power and 
beautiful interior.  The stabilitrac 
helps with corners and does not have 
body roll like a regular SUV."

YOU FEEL EVERY bump-- and 2wd 
indistinguisable from 4wd -- we test 
drove a 4wd and were told it was a 2WD-
4wD a wonderful vehicle- 
One cannot get past call center people 
to talk to Cadillac --
We could not get a fair deal to 
upgrade to 4WD -- to correct what is 
an obvious CADILLAC problem"
cadillac,escalade,2002,M N Bajrangi, 08/18/2009,Minor problems,3,"I enjoyed driving the escalade, but since it the first year it came out a few minor hiccup need to be corrected. When the back shock stays up it puts pressure on the front, thus when one goes in a little hole the front suspension goes up and down repeatedly."

the gas mileage it's a fun vehicle to 
drive.I just purchased a silver sand

have not driven my vehicle on the

Christmas Eve of 2001, and it has been 
a pleasureable experience since.  We 
regularly use it for long trips (200+ 
mi).  It is very comfortable and the 
seats are divine.  After trying out the 
Lexus LX470 and Toyota Land Cruiser, 
the Escalade was the obvious choice.  
Both alternatives were very 
uncomfortable, (odd for a lexus), and 
not very appealing.  The engine is 
wonderful and nothing comes close.  
Dont buy a Denali, the Escalade is the 
best suv for the money!!"

that is like a house downpayment but i 
have the money so its alright i guess."
cadillac,escalade,2003,Rex, 11/21/2006,The Slade,4,"This is a great vehicle.  It sounds like a muscle car when started. The only thing that I don't like is where the heated seat warmer button is. This is because every time I lock the door or open the window, I accidentally hit the stupid heated seat button, and the next thing I know, my butt is on fire (or it feels like it).  This is very frustrating. Other than that, the truck is very reliable and has very good performance. It also turns heads. I love the halogen lights as well. Overall this is a great vehicle!"

cadillac,escalade,2003,msjanuary, 12/26/2005,My first American made vehicle,4,"I love the performance of the 2003 Cadillac Escalade as a whole. The gas mileage is tough, but it drives like a dream. I have owned Mercedes and Lexus and the comfort on this Escalade runs circles around those cars. I love how high it sits and the way it handles through mountains. I generally keep vehicles for three years, but I will keep this an extra year then buy the new model. It is super."
cadillac,escalade,2003,R & D, 09/02/2006,'03 Escalade,4,"After my first week of owership I became very disappointed for about the next three months because it turned out that we wound up with an Escalade that had a lemon differential.  Once the service department figured out what was wrong with the car and totally replaced the differential with a brand new one, my truck started spending more time with us instead of in the shop.  Although it was fun driving all the different ""new lenders"" they gave us to drive while the car was in the shop."

Exhaust chimes after driving 5 miles 
and parking as it cools. Seat heater 
button is too close to the power window 
button. Turns on heat when you try to 
operate window.  Air conditioning has 
quit. Service stability alarm has come 
on seeral times. Cargo door needs a 
gorilla slam to avoid a door ajar alarm 
as you are driving down the

2002. Except for air conditioner,

have to live with it. Not at $50,000 I 
don't. "

I have owned many cars and SUVs, from Lexus, Mercedes and many others. Not only does my Escalade look cool but it drives as good as it looks. I did put on 22"" rims. Only problem with the wheels is the Escalade attracts alot of attention. Sometimes it can be unwanted attention but I wouldn't change a thing. "

comfortable, has great visibility, 
like the interior for the most part. 
Exterior looks great! That counts for 
something~right!  Very easy to park, 
brake & back up.  Like the reverse 
chimes, they are not annoying(like in 
the Jag). Would prefer that the fake 
wood was real (very very cheap~who 
dropped the ball on that detail? 
Demote him!) The interior is 
definitely more cheaply stylized than 
it should be. It is still a Cadillac 
after all. Way too noisy for my taste. 
But the soundproofing is very good.  
Just hate slinking through 
neighborhoods like a redneck. Exhaust 
is too loud, this thing should purr or 
at least make it an option. "

by far my favorite car. So I was 
excited to see the refinements in the 
2003 model. I was very disappointed. 
They upped the price and cheapened the 
insides significantly. They moved the 
computer console, took away some of the 
convenience buttons on the dash and the 
steering wheel, changed the center 
console from 2 compartments to 1, and 
added a useless opening in 
the dash.The trailer package, which was 
included in the 2002, became an option 
in 2003. All in all, I was very 
disappointed in this year's model from 
the inside appearance standpoint. As 
far as power and outside appearance, it 
was outstanding. "

cadillac,escalade,2003,John Gentile, 06/01/2005,My 2003 Escalade,4,The only thing that has gone wrong for me is the front seat has poped off twice. The bottom of the seat material pops away from frame of seat and makes a loud noise every time. I do not care about the milage. I think it is fine for the weight of the car. I love my Escalade. I think Cadillac has got it right. It handles like a dream and turns on a dime. I love the interior but the clock is a little loud. I had a blowout on the freeway while on vacation with my family. The stability Track worked perfect and did not pull stopping straight as an arrow.

an eye catcher! People just stare when

was that passed them. It wraps you in 
luxury as you cruise the highways, 
intimidating all others who don't drive

alone get double takes by everyone. If

it's beautiful. I have received several 
compliments about the color in the 
short time we've had it. Took the 
Escalade on a Phoenix to Denver

This is by far the best SUV on the

actually consider driving on trips 
instead of flying!  The reviews that 
tell you to buy a Lincoln instead were 
obviously written by people who have 
never driven the Escalade.  That is 
the only way to explain their wrong 
advice.  Granted, the MPG is not the 
best, but if you can afford a 50k+ 
vehicle, you don't care about the 
extra cost of the gasoline. Besides, 
Power=Fuel consumption. If your into 
Luxury and pure power, you've found it

Pros:

-Excellent V8 engine that snarls when you put your foot down and has no trouble smoking most vehicles on the road.

-Handles well

-Good sound system

Cons:

-The interior build quality is a real black eye. They dropped the ball on this one.

-Some replacement parts are pricey

-Electronics build quality is also a little spotty"
cadillac,escalade,2004,latrae75, 12/15/2007,"A ""Truck"" underneath the Glamour",4,"I purchased my 2004 Escalade with the 6.0 liter in February. It was certified and came with the extended factory bumper to bumper 6yr/100k warranty. I hear about people complaining about it's fuel economy, but you must realize that behind all the chrome and flash that this is still a 5700 lb truck with a 6 liter V8. I use to get about 17 mpg on the highway, but I have installed a K&N filter($50) and a custom Flowmaster exhaust system($450), and now I get between 20-21 mpg with premium(93 octane) gas on the highway cruising at 70 mph, with 22"" wheels. If fuel consumption is a worry for you, then simply don't buy an suv. But this truck is absolutely awesome, especially on long 200+ mile trips. "

The only reason why I might never buy another Cadillac after owning soooo many is the cheap and horrible design of the interiors.  I'm begging Cadillac to change their outdated mindset of plastic and unimaginative thinking and take example from Lincoln when it comes to interior design. Power rear hatch, folding rear seats, rain sensor wipers, cooled leather seats, center shifter, and please get rid of the plastic!  Make it a Cadillac not a Tahoe with enhanced cheap trim.  We are all getting tired of GM cutting corners on Cadillac. If it does not change, my selection will."

He purchased his a year later.  His speedometer just went out too.  We were told to call Cadillac that there is a Campaign that we should be reimbursed for the part.

has the best of everything and looks 
great too. The power is mind boggling. 
You feel like you are in a sports car

the navigator and x5. I choose this

the handeling and how easy it is for a 
person to drive. i let my 75 year old 
mother drive it and she thinks it is 
very easy to drive. i have two kids 
and like the third row feature it's 
just when u need the cargo space it is 
kind of hard to change from passenger 
to cargo mood. but this is great i luv 
it in the winter. it has great 
handeling and i like how high it sits 
up but it still is low enough to 
comfortably get in."

Escalade. After driving it and 
thoroughly comparing it with Navigator 
and Mercedes, I can honestly say it is 
a the best of the three. The only 
negative problem I have had has been 
some rattling, unavailability of rear 
cargo mat and lack of storage room when 
the thrid row seats are in place.

I would purchase another one."

its nothing more than a rebadged tahoe. 
I sort of regret buying it because 
theres almost no difference in the 
interior, exept the wood grain that 
looks like it was from a vehicle from 
the 80's or something.also, the plastic 
and leather dont seem to be up to the 
50k standard. in other words, the 
interior should be more refined and 
differentiated from the tahoe, like the 
navigator is from the expedition.Also, 
this vehicle needs to lose the ugly 
column shifter. The 285 hp v8 is slow. 
this vehicle should just come with the 
340 hp engine. "

years GM cannot build a dashboard that 
does not squeak! Not as noisy as my 
benchmark 74 Camaro, but can't the 
imports teach Detroit a thing or two in 
building a $62k car? The driver's door 
when slammed sounds like my old 85 K5 
tailgate-like something is loose and 
broken inside. All these were present 
since purchase. Interior leather is 
excellent but lets add the standard 
Cadillac rain sensor, not the Chevy 
wiper delay. And how about he seat 
massager like the DTS? Great overall 
look but too many places to clean-how 
about moving the gaskets closer to the

If you are looking for an SUV and want the very 
best,
by an Escalade."
cadillac,escalade,2005,Ed, 01/11/2010,Cadi ESV is the best,4,"This is a best SUV, car and truck.  I have driven ESV for 5 yrs and love it.  Driven in the snow storm and full snow on the road, it feels like car hugs the road.  Going up the mountain, CanWhistler, Salt City, Colorado, Lake Tahoe, it has the all the power you need and more.  Driving in the city, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, it feels like your driving a car and it is has the luxury ride.  This Cadi is very reliable and I have not had any problems of any sort.  Pulling a 3-5 ton trailer no problem, you can't even feel your even pulling a trailer.  After 67,000 miles on the Cadi, it  beats any Toyota, Lexus, Mercedes and Rover.  You got to try it to believe it.  I have for 5yrs."

It was fully decked out, on 22s, chrome door handles, gas door, mirrors, all 4 windows were tinted, remote start, second row tv, gps. the previous guy even took out the original seats and put in custom black leather seats, he also put in a train horn alarm, ipod auxillary, and thousands of dollars worth of speakers and subs to make the bose audio twice as loud, just as bassy, and very very clear froma distance. The car was in perfect shape inside and out, very reliable for the 1 year we had it. I got to drive it twice a week, and my girlfriend loved it jsut as much as she loves me. The reason we sold it-gas mileage. I still miss it"
cadillac,escalade,2005,mikeygg69, 07/01/2011,"Luxury, Performance, and Fun",5,"This is the best truck I have ever driven. Every time I drive my Escalade SUV it's like an adventure; from the stereo system to the beefy performance and luxurious ride, 2005 Cadillac Escalade is the best SUV ever.
I have never heard a better stereo system in my life, and I actually own a BMW with a Harmon Cardin stereo system.
It cannot touch the Escalade. It is like my own personal symphony orchestra at a touch of a button. I attempted a trade in a year ago, but change my mind after the test drive. I am fully convinced that the 2005, Cadillac Escalade is the best SUV truck available, hands down. If you want a reliable truck, go find you a 2005, Cadillac Escalade truck."

Even got comparable 22"" chrome bling.  It is, without question, the prettiest, beefiest, most noticeable production car on the road today, even after 10 years post-concept (first production version was model year '02).  Now the problem is, without spending $100K+ on something really highend, what do we replace it with in 5-6 years?  There is nothing even up to the 2012-hopper even comparable."

Now Caddy says they won't fix the whistling noise in the engine, the continuous buzzing of the navigation system, the clunking of the transmission and the blurry, defective driver side mirror.  I was told I have to live with it.  I hope no GM/Cadillac customer will just ""live with"" poor quality.  From one Caddy customer to all the others...they will NOT back their product.  They have over 120 technical service bulletins for just the 2005 Escalade alone, while most vehicles have maybe 10-20 a year. Oh, and GM's customer service stinks!  Yeah, I'm mad!"

cadillac,escalade,2005,nick, 04/13/2005,Making them better for 2005,4,"I purchased this vehicle two months ago and it has been a great experience. I currently have 14,000 miles on it and it runs great, and rides very smooth. The 2005 model seems to have a smoother transmission and an improved navigation unit, now touch screen. I originally purchased this vehicle because of its performance capabilities and and it's all wheel drive for the part of the country I live in. I would recommend this SUV for anyone looking for a high performace smooth luxury SUV that actually looks good!"
cadillac,escalade,2005,Cadillac SUV, 06/11/2005,Another Cadillac,4,"The Cadillac Escalade lives up to the Cadillac reputation.  The Escalade has sexy styling with well contoured curves.  The interior of the Escalade is where is really shines, with all the bells and whisltes you can imagine, you feel like your in a small jet. It takes some reading and practice to get use to its instrument panel and if your lucky enough to have it, the readout on the trip computer and satelite radio.  The stereo is built in digitally and sounds very nice as well as the 5 CD changer.  The most fun is the dual climate control (really tri) for driver, passanger and rear passanger (all seperate for each persons comfort)  The vehicle handles well, but it takes longer to stop."

It meets my needs and expectations in an SUV with the exceptiond of gas mileage (about 14-16 mpg). The electronics and automatic features are wonderful with the way the electronic sunroof closes automatically upon exiting the vehicle. The backup warning feature is also quite helpful. Since I did not get the navigational system, the rear camera feature is not avaiable.  The exterior styling and engine size of the vehicle, puts it ahead of other comparable vehicles, in my view. "

2004 Esclade ESV ( GM pull ahead made me
a deal I couldn't refuse).  I considered
getting another Denali but I heard the
suspension on the Esclade was better
than the Denali.  It truly is even
better than my Denali.  The car cruises
beautifully on the highway for long
hauls, it carries my kids and dogs all
together.  The climate control is great
for such a big vehicle.  I am very very
happy and will hold this one until they
come out with the redesign in 2007."
cadillac,escalade,2005,ALEX H., 10/23/2004,Worst suspension and handiling,3,"Worst suspension and handiling ever 
expierienced. Vehicle throws you off 
road when riding over a small 
pothole.At 23000 miles transmission had 
to be rebuild, consitant problems and 
having to send back to dealer. Power on 
vehicle is to much for the poor 
handiling and suspension. Vechile is to 
overrated."

workmanship is evident everywhere,even 
long distances are not tiring!
You just feel that you have a lot of 
space,a lot of air to breathe and the 
acoustics are outstanding...
OnStar and voice activated phone

It is a very solid riding and handling 
vehicle.  It has plenty of power and 
great passing speed.  They did take a 
few things out of the 2005 like the 
dual compartment console and also the 
lock on it.  I do wish the second row 
of seats would lay flat to give me more 
room in the back for long cargo.  Over 
all it's a great vehicle and I will buy 
anther one."

with opening and closing. Also, the low tire 
pressure warning lamp does not indicate 
which tire is low.  I found this to be

The mileage is what you expect from an SUV.  We are having some problems with the hands free phone not understanding us but have not yet looked into getting it fixed.  The driver's seat is comfortable and with the memory settings there are no arguments about moving the seat.  I am definitely impressed with the quality of our Escalade.  We've had SUVs before and a common problem was an impaired view on turns.  This is definitely not a problem with the Escalade.

I am now 43 and finally feel that I've landed my feet into the vehicle I had aspired to, all these years. If I knew that All WHEEL DRIVE would be sooo convient and give me great road control.. I'd bought one years sooner.. I While I have NEVER had brand new I am just as satified with my 2005 Black Escalade AWD.. my only problems are that of the Cluster Board, blanked out face to radio, front end suspension, and falsely presented rear climate control. That rear climate control neither gets hot or cold.. just a fan to circulate.. dial description showshot and cold adjustments but it changes nothing.. it's just designed to circulate air pulled from the front.. smh.. POOR JOB G.M!!.. when you spend money like that you exspect maximum comfort on spell!!.. Heated seats don't stay on long... I've only had my truck for 3 months but with our crazy weather in Saint Louis, Missouri I don't miss a beat.. I laugh when it's rainy and every one else is fish tailing when light turns green.. lol..

I have 80,000 miles on it now and haven't had anything go wrong other than an issue with the heater fan, it wouldn't stop running even when off, so the dealership fixed it and haven't had any other issues.  It just now needs new brakes, other than that I haven't put a dime into it as far as repairs go.  I wanted to trade it in for a newer model, but I wasn't impressed with the interior on the new Escalades, my 2005 is much more plush and looks way better; the new ones look cheap inside...no caddy logos in the seats?

Then I bought a 1999 Cadillac Escalade (new) had very few problems except that OnStar kills the battery about every 18 months and that it is not very good on gasoline.  Well this 2005 Escalade is very stylish, has lots of power, is comfortable, and not that bad on gas.  Its gas mileage could be better, but it's not nearly as bad as the 1999 Escalade that I owned previously.  "

Toyotas and others are overrated on thier performance and milage abilities. I am a maitenance guy and have worked on vehicles and equipment for over 40 years.  The one thing I have found is that most people are not totally honest about thier fuel mileage or maintenance problems. Most don't keep thier tires inflated to the proper inflation or don't realize how much fuel quality can differ from dealer to dealer."

Cadillac knows about it and so far they have replaced one part, but the noise continued. Now I have to take it back so they can replace the power steering which they claim should fix the problem.

The newer models dont have the towing capacity of this truck. Everytime I look at new vehicles they dont have that feel. I have never had a car this long. Just had the headliner and front seats done for 1000. 228,000 running strong just 43 tune ups and 1 full A/c front then rear. I had the tranny cleaned and said it looked great no metal bands looked good.

cadillac,escalade,2006,Transporter, 06/12/2007,2ND Time Around!,4,"Had a 2002 Escalade and found a great deal on new 2006 AWD that had been on the lot. Some minor changes such as XM stereo, navigation, phone from the 2002. Rides a little smoother. All in all another great SUV. Have averaged 18.5 MPG on freeway a liitle better than the 2002 which was 17.5. No one mistakes this Cadillac SUV for just another SUV.  "
cadillac,escalade,2006,scott, 09/16/2008,2nd Time Around!,4,"I consider myself a 'car guy' and have an '02 540i black on black manual 6 speed.  I love cars and research them in my spare time!?!  I reluctantly leased an '04 Escalade ESV when the Chevy Suburban salesman tried to rob me!  Unhappy at the time, but momma wanted it so 4 years later, we loved the truck so much we decided to buy it off lease and were heartbroken when GMC wouldn't negotiate.  We looked at the Lexus and the Denali among others.  Just today we bought an '06 Escalade and couldn't be happier!  The others didn't have the ride, the comfort, reliability or the look!  we feel like we're home again!"
cadillac,escalade,2006,Paul of Las Vegas, 12/09/2005,Big and Brawny,4,"The professional reviews talk about the Esacalade's dated interior, but I think they miss the point. The interior works: it's practical, comfortable, and high quality. It may not match the latest BMW or Audi, but that's part of it's thugish charm. I test drove a few SUV's, but most were ruled out by the lack of 7-8 seats, the poor customer service of the dealer, or looks. In the end, the only two contenders were Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade.  I was surprised by the Lade's driving, quality, engine performance, ride, handling, and finally, all those practical touches: from the walk-thru center seats to the Onstar cell phone. I love it - highly recommended!"
cadillac,escalade,2006,wilpwr, 05/17/2006,Not a Bad Ride,4,"The 2006 Cadillac Escalade is a nice ride.  It has an exceptional sound system and lots of bells and whistles. Unfortunately it requires premium fuel, ouch! But the gas milage isn't that bad. I drove nearly 180 highway miles on a 1/2 tank, mostly at 60 mph.  "
cadillac,escalade,2006,hlewis, 04/21/2006,"I Love my ""truck""!",4,"This car makes me feel like I am in the safest and one of the most attractive vehicles on the road. It's turning radius is amazing, considering its size. I have only owned Mercedes-Benz vehicles before this and have been pleaseanty surprized with this car.  I could not find an Mercedes that I liked better than this SUV. I drive both long highway distances and short commutes with equal ease. I plan on owning my Escalade for 10 years and expect it to last well beyond that."
cadillac,escalade,2006,Eva, 07/27/2010,Nice with style!,4,We bought a 2006 last summer in 2010 and since the moment I started driving this beauty I realized what Cadillac is all the fuss about. I love it. Front differential went out and could be an expensive fix. Other than that the car has 100 + miles and it drives like new. 
cadillac,escalade,2006,ME, 10/11/2005,Best SUV,4,"This is the best SUV out there.  After 3 years of absolutely no problems with my first Escalade, I couldn't resist getting another one.  It is luxurious AND reliable!  It handles better than most cars!"
cadillac,escalade,2006,Tom, 10/31/2005,Good Ride,4,"The Escalade is a great SUV.  I am surprised that it does not come with rain sensitive windshield wipers however.  Some SUV's that cost $20,000 less at least have that option.  One of the big pluses with this vehicle is the dealer network.  My dealer was great - it only took an hour and a half from the time I set foot in the door until the paperwork was all done and I was on my way.  If you're looking for a large, luxury SUV that other drivers on the road respect due to its size, this one's a winner."
cadillac,escalade,2006,Morning, 12/30/2005,Rolling in Michigan,4,"The 2006 Cadillac Escalade is a great truck.  It has even more features than my DeVille.  It is fun to drive and has a beautiful design.  I totally enjoy the XM radio and panicked when my trial period neared its end (and I was the one who said that I never listened to the radio while driving...yeah right).  OnStar occasionally gets you lost although there is the capability to record the directions. The navigation system is a must. It easily guides you to your destination.  The heated seats are great on a cold winter's day.  I could use a few more inches of leg room for driving though.  This truck is surprisingly easy to park, especially with the visual and sound alarms to prevent bumping in the rear. This is a great vehicle.  It gets the respect that it deserves. "
cadillac,escalade,2006,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, 07/11/2006,Nice Truck,5,"My 2006 Cadillac Escalade has the perfect ride and great handling.  It is greqt looking, too.  I love its smooth cornering."
cadillac,escalade,2006,bridgit, 03/02/2008,Fun,4,My wife thoroughly enjoys this car. She always told me it was an old man's car. I would not try to take it away from her. It was the first Cadillac she ever drove. Her other car was a Lexus and Camry. She won't ever consider a Lexus now.
cadillac,escalade,2006,escalade, 08/16/2005,2006 Cadillac Escalade,4,The Cadillac Escalade is one the best vehicles that I have owned in my lifetime.  The quality and performance are both there. Its gas milage not that bad. I would like to see next generation of this model because I will by another.
cadillac,escalade,2007,Cuervo_Black, 06/20/2010,Great Ride,4,"Omg! I'm in love with a Cadillac. I love this vehicle. At first I was looking to buy a Denali and to my fortune god gave me this escalade. Let me start with the bad first. The door handles are cheap, they break but are not expensive to repair. Second, gas mileage in the city. Its a beast on the streets but on the interstate it does good. Well it has the best gas mileage for its size and class. I'm spoiled with all the features. Dvd, navigation, stability, camera, comfort and power. This baby purrs when you floor it. People have given this SUV a bad review don't understand that you rather have safety comfort and power over price and gas mileage. Its a balance of what you get. You won't regret it"
cadillac,escalade,2007,builder6, 11/05/2010,Beautiful SUV /to much plastic,4,"We love the comfort, style and look of this SUV. It's a pleasure to drive and have not experienced the wind noise problem that I have read so many complaints about. My only and biggest problem is the quality with which it was made. I owned a BMW before this and never had a problem with the build. The ESV however has one piece of plastic after the other that breaks, cracks, peels or fails in someway. From my tow hitch cover, to my door handle, to the center console what American made crap. Made in America should mean made well and with quality. They could learn something from the Germans when putting together a vehicle of this price tag."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Mark, 11/15/2006,My First Caddy,4,"This is my first American-made vehicle in 15 years...and lovin' my new Escalade.  It has a wonderful ride and most of the features that I wanted (no Bluetooth -- come on GM!).  The exterior styling is fantastic...just the right amount of chrome.  The interior is much improved, it's wonderful for an American-made SUV.  GM still has plenty to learn from Lexus, BMW and Infiniti."
cadillac,escalade,2007,highflier1, 05/28/2012,The Best,4,"This is my favorite vehicle by far. I have the ESV with all options. I love the size, the ride height, the roominess. I am 6'4"" and this vehicle gives me the headroom, legroom, hiproom, shoulder room I like. I like riding high up and the visibility is superb. I can take 6 people in comfort and still have room for luggage etc. The Lexus, Mercedes, Infinitis, etc of the world can't compare for room. Also the Escalade has a panache, cache, a presense all its own. It is distinctive and not like the clone SUV's you see everywhere. As well, it is truck based, solid as a rock, heavy, sturdy, and reliable. Safety has a lot to do with physics, when bigger hits smaller, who wins?"
cadillac,escalade,2007,nray, 05/12/2006,An Awesome Luxury SUV,4,"The dealership-I am a repeat customer- was helpful and the vehicle exceeded my expectations in luxury and comfort. The exterior design is great, but the added creature comforts inside this next generation of Escalade are amazing. The seats are so comfortable and the instrument panel is very clear and easy to read day and night. I can't praise this SUV enough."
cadillac,escalade,2007,hot and awsome, 10/21/2006,Hot and Awsome,4,"The new 2007 Cadillac Escalade has the hottest body styling on the market right now. The car is tuned for speed, but still can be driven comfortably.  The engine is wisper quiet while crusing on the highway, but wakes up instantly with one touch of your right foot.  So if you're looking for a luxury SUV with the heart of a sports car this is the buy for you."
cadillac,escalade,2007,homer, 12/07/2006,rRad Noise,4,"I like the car a lot, except that the wind and road noise are really bad.  A friend I took on a long road trip said his two year old Tahoe is much quieter.  Sad, but I have to agree with him.  The dealer adjusted the doors once but it didn't help. Is there a fix out there? "
cadillac,escalade,2007,DOS, 12/19/2006,Big Is Better,4,"I just did a test drive on both the '07 Navigator and the '07 Escalade.  The BIG difference was the motor and the instrument electronics. The Escalade's ride was very nice as was the handling. The seats in the Navigator were a bit better, as was the 3rd row seating but I saw a drop off in the engineers to incorporate the electronics the way Escalade did.  I now own the Escalade.  The styling was the major factor in my decision.  The Navigator was a bit cheaper even with the options packages.  I'm not buying the Escalade for gas savings, but it's nice to know you can use regular gas when it's crunch time! "
cadillac,escalade,2007,macnamara532, 12/24/2008,My American Car Buying Days Are Over,2,"I have tried to support the American car manufacturer, but I can't anymore. I have had everything from havng to replace the console, because it was rattling so much, too the cheap plastic Door handles that cut my wife's hand. The molding around the windows is falling apart. Then the recalls, the last one because the unit that heated the windshield wiper fluid had heated up while not in use, and apparently had started fires. These are just the proverbial tip of the iceberg, many other things have gone wrong, but I am getting depressed even more by continuing on. Needless to say, I love General Motors, but until they improve quality, I  will no longer be a loyal buyer."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Mark, 03/25/2006,excellent rebuild,4,"This new rebuild of the Escalade is awesome.  They have made many improvements from their older models.  The new dash layout is fantastic, especially if you get it with the info package.  The touch screen navigation is easier to navigate then with buttons and knobs. The instrument panel competes with many other luxury vehicles as well. And one great feature that this truck has that I have not seen on any other cars is the intellibeam system which puts the highbeams on when it pitch black, this is great for turnpike driving when there's oncoming vehicles. Overall I think General Motors out did themselves, and I would recommend this truck to anyone."
cadillac,escalade,2007,David Graham, 09/29/2015,Over 100000 miles and it still performs,4,"Just got back from a 1000 mile road trip with my buddies and the Escalade did not disappoint.  Ride was smooth, power was great and even though the 2015's completely changed the look, this car still looks great.  We purchased the car used with 35000 miles and its had some minor repairs.  (motor mounts, door handles power liftgate motor, power mirror motor) My main gripe is the lack of an aux jack or USB jack.  We thought the rear aux jack could be used to connect an IPOD but that doesnt work.

cadillac,escalade,2007,niki, 12/17/2006,Not What I Expected,2,"Well I have been driving an Escalade for seven years now and love it! Ready to try on the new 2007 model, I drove to the dealership to pick it up!  Cadillac is well aware of my disappointment, I called them! This is a $65,000 - $70,000 truck and I felt the interior quality was significantly lower than in years past!  You can see dramatic cuts they made to make it seem more roomy!  The seats are less comfortable and the cup holders, ha!  The windows don't power up! The automatic back hatch is awesome though.  At least that's an improvement.  But bring back my confy seats!  I think I want my 2004 Escalade back! "
cadillac,escalade,2007,Kriller, 01/13/2007,Thin Plastic Seems to be in Style,2,"I haven't sold my '04 Escalade yet and I can't wait to get rid of my '07 model so that I can sit comfortably again.  How could GM switch the comfy seats for these cardboard-ones? I got tired after driving for an hour, bumping around on roads I used to think were smooth, having my thoughts drowned in the engine, road, wind, and interior-noise! The Cashmere interior is too bright and will look old in six months.. It still has no flat folding 3rd row seats.  And it still has no telescoping steering wheel.. Even though the styling is generally improved (mostly in the exterior front, the back looks like any GMC-truck) the over-sleekness of the interior came with a price - loss of personality. The engine sounds impressive, but lacks the power to impress. Overall this truck has a cheep feeling."
cadillac,escalade,2007,sammy500c, 04/10/2010,Love this SUV,4,"I love everything about this car. It's sleek, sophisticated, and a luxury to drive in SUVs. Gas mileage could be improved of course with the economy the way it is, but over all, you can't go wrong to own this car. ENJOY"
cadillac,escalade,2007,jean, 10/27/2006,Best Ever,4,"This is the sixteenth new Cadillac we have bought and the best one ever.  It makes you feel safe.  It's  easy to drive, to park, has navigation, OnStar, and all around audio is fantastic. I plan to keep this car a long time.  "
cadillac,escalade,2007,ike, 01/24/2007,Nice Drive,4,"I have had this vehicle for about six months, and I have to say that it is the best vehicle that I have ever owned.  My last vehicle was an Expedition, and the motor, driving, interior, exterior of the Escalade are many times better.  Great job in making me look so good while driving my vehicle. Just one thing bothers me, actually two. One is the fact that a vehicle like mine does not have a fuel button! I have to go outside:( and the engine key is so not ""Cadillac"", while other lesser vehicles have push button start ups, and all sort of nice keys, Cadillacs is disappointing. Besides that, this is the best large SUV on the freeway."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Dillpickle AndDena, 10/27/2017,Don't Buy,3,"I have two Cadillacs I bought new. We did all the maintenance but yet both cars needed new engines. My 2008 cts at 110,000 miles. And my 2007 escalade about 105,000 miles. I had an aftermarket warranty on both cars thank goodness!  If not, I would be carless. I will no longer buy Cadillac. They don't make their cars to last. In my area I have a dealership in Naples and ft myers. Ft myers one treated me so good until my car got old!  In fact they didn't want to work on them after the 100,000 mile mark. They put in the engine in the cts and did such a poor job. I will never use that dealership again!

cadillac,escalade,2007,Bill Spilker, 06/05/2018,Riding high and heavy,4,"This is a comfortable highway cruiser with lots of power that can haul a big load or six big adults with room and comfort to spare.  Dependability has been pretty good, but repairs are expensive.  A little noisier than I would have expected for a vehicle costing this much, and definitely sucks the gas, but that is because it is big, powerful, and offers just about every creature comfort you could ask for.  My wife likes it better than sliced bread, and I got it for her (60 mile one-way commutes on small state highways).  We have been pretty pleased with it.

cadillac,escalade,2007,SUPERRPH, 11/02/2006,Blissed-out BLING!,5,"I love this truck! My 9 year old son calls her the Escalady, what a lady she is! I have driven my 2007 Escalade for 6 months and 12,000 miles. I still can't get over all of the yearning stares (male and female, young and old) and comments about what a beautiful vehicle it is. After all the Escalade is at the top of the food chain. Power is delivered smoothly over the entire power curve. The engine runs quietly at cruising speeds. Push down your right foot and  experience spirited acceleration along with a throaty harmonic sound of unbridled power and arrogance. Its fand finish is luxurious. The import luxury SUVs don't even come close! I looked at them all! Cadillac is back on top. "
cadillac,escalade,2007,ggc, 09/17/2007,Bad Luck,3," I had the misfortune of choosing probably the worst Escalade in the lot. When I see all these ""10"" ratings in performance form other customers, I just feel like crying. Just bought a 2007 Escalade. I always wanted to have a Cadillac. I had a Navigator before (which I loved ) but the new ones are so ugly.. The Escalade is so impresive and beautiful.. But is probably the worst ride I ever had...starting with the loud wind noise, busy and rough shifting and having to ""step on it"" to get some kind of speed. I regret this buy big time. Dealer cannot ""reproduce"" the problem. I wany my Chrysler Pacifica back!"
cadillac,escalade,2007,natawika, 11/08/2013,Never again,3,"I have had nothing but problems with my 2007 Cadillac Escalade.
I literally have this vehicle in the shop just about every other month.
New battery, serpentine belt, both wheel bearings, struts, wheel bearing sensors, DVD player quit, ball joints, service rear camera.
What next?
Plus, everything I have fixed was expensive.
Seats are starting to fall apart.
I would expect this from a vehicle that was beat on, but my esclade is mainly used for family trips.
I can't wait to get rid of it!"
cadillac,escalade,2007,david saylor, 12/20/2006,2007 Cadillac Escalade EXT,3,"I have had problems with chopping the outside edge of the front tires.  The tailgate on the EXT just falls open.  The edge at the back of the tailgate is higher than the gate itself, a design flaw."
cadillac,escalade,2007,GOBOILERS1, 02/02/2009,Save Dollars Buy a Denali,3,"Traded my'04Denali for this and have been disappointed.Took major downgrade in bells and whistles which is just wrong for the price. Wifes '02 Trailblazer has more! Seats are hard, small and uncomfortable. Traded because Denali seats had no support and Escalade is like sitting on a box. GM's ""new improved"" rain sensing wipers are terrible.Watch the car in front - you will hit it before it wipes! Wind noise is pathetic! I know it is a big box but come on! My friends Expedition is soooo much quieter. The third row seats weigh a ton! Majir pain to take in and out. When out the big plastic strips that seats ride on are in the way. GM saved a few bucks with no light in glovebox or under hood "
cadillac,escalade,2007,NG, 08/10/2009,Best Luxury SUV,4,"I recently bought my first Cadillac.  I traded in my Mercedes for the Escalade and i couldn't be happier.  We bought a 07 with 17,000 miles on it.  It is Fantastic! Living in Minnesota where the winters are the longest season it makes sense to have a SUV such as this one. The only thing i wish it had was a MP3 jack for my IPOD.  Other than that it has everything you could want in a SUV. I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anybody living in extreme climates who desire that luxury car feel!  "
cadillac,escalade,2007,Tess, 02/12/2010,Better Mileage Than Advertised,4,"I consistently get 18-20 mpg :)  Wish newer Cadillacs were as comfy as the older models.  Had a 2002 and from the handle grip above the passenger seat, to the arm rests for front passengers, to the soft comfortable seats - it was superior to the 2007.  2007 should have had an Mp3/Ipod connection as standard equipment.  The 22 inch tires do not provide as good of a ride, though they do look nice.  A little better shock/suspension system would an help offset that."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Chas., 03/13/2006,Worthy of Cadillac Name,4,"This is my third Escalade. Have had an '02 and '04 and now '07. This is the best yet. They solved most all of my issues with previous models. Dash is lower and well laid out, visibility better both fore an aft. Seats are a little smaller but still very comfortable. New 6 speed tranny is much better on response through the full range and seems to get better mileage than my '04. Navigation system is a vast improvement. Ride is much more controlled. Plush without giving up responsiveness. Fold and tumble seats are nice but having to manually put them back up is a waste. Power lift and close rear gate is a wonderful feature."
cadillac,escalade,2007,moose, 03/23/2006,The Big Dog,5,This truck is the best.  I think as far as SUVs go it stands alone.  It's in a class by itself.  The only way to know how good this truck is is to own one.  I have had many other SUVs and the '07 Escalade just takes you on another journy.  If you don't own one you are missing out.
cadillac,escalade,2007,Alan Ross, 04/10/2006,Improving But Still Not There,3,"Cadillac has done a nice job of restyling the Escalade but unfortunately they have a way to go to beat their Japanese competitors. The outside is beuatiful and the inside looks good but looks can be deceiving. There is almost no storage room in the back, the rear windows only open part way, the sideboard windows not at all. The upgraded stereo is marginal and little things like the cuip holders are still cheap and not what you would expect on a vehicle at this cost. Gas mileage to date is terrible, around 11- 12 miles per gallon in mixed (city/hiway) traffic. There are a number of rattles in the vehicle as well. All things considered, I would have expected more from a vehicle at this price."
cadillac,escalade,2007,hhhhhhaaaaaayyyyyyyy, 05/03/2006,2007 Cadillac Escalade,4,Yeah the 2007 Cadillac Escalade is pretty much a great vehicle. IT drives nicely and looks hot going down the road. I'd reccomend it to anyone looking for comfort AND style. Fo sho. buy one today!
cadillac,escalade,2007,Bill W, 06/03/2006,Even Better,4,"This is my 4th Escalade, I started buying them in '02. This seems to be the best one yet, it continues to look great, especially in black with 22"" wheels. The navigation system is easy to use but has had glitches, When it warms up and the vehicle is shut off, it will not resume operation, stating ""disc misread"". The ride is very good as it has been in all of my previous models and it continues to be easy to manuever. This one is very fast for an SUV this big, it's just 0.5 seconds slower 0-60 than my 1970 GTO ""Judge.""  Its build quality appears to remain solid and dealer service has in the past been excellent and local which is great! I will continue to purchase this model."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Gary Crouch, 04/30/2006,Dream Machine,5,"This is by far the best Escalade yet. It drives as smooth as butter, is extremely comfortable, has load of power with the 403 hp engine and gets average fuel mileage. I traded in a 2004 Range Rover and haven't regretted it for one second. It's a real head turner and gets looks everywhere I go. I would highly recommed this vehicle. There's nothing like a Cadillac."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Susan, 05/27/2006,My 2007 Escalade,4,"I have had 4 Escalades, 3 Devilles, 2 Sevilles and one CTS. Every single time I want to get a new model, I go out and test drive other makes and models and.....go back to Cadillac. The new Nissan Armada is just like driving a big old bulky truck....not AT ALL like the Escalade, the Lexus GX 470 disappointed me also as did the BMW (too small) and Mercedes (too small). The Lincoln Navigator also was short changed on the interior, it just felt plastic-like...NOTHING like the Escalade. The 2007 has pep and can bust out at the light or passing on a two lane road. The changes from 2006 to 2007 are PROMINENT and VERY WORTH WHILE. I also would rate this gem as one of the SEXIEST SUVs on the market."
cadillac,escalade,2007,LK, 06/25/2006,You get what you pay for!,4,"I confess...the '07 Cadillac Escalade appearance sucked me in. There have been many changes in to it for '07, like a new ft suspension, punched out the 6.0 to 6.2L added more HP, heated and cooled seats, a heated steering wheel, and  other great creature comforts. If you have a need for a large SUV, this is the one! The gas mileage is great for its class!. Don't hate the luxury sport UTILITY vehicle and it's mileage...hate the people who buy one with out really needing them! If your like me and spend a lot of time in your vehicle, tow occasionally, haul light materials.. Maybe it is time you pampered yourself? It is everything I expected. The '08 model can only get better from here."
cadillac,escalade,2007,VICKY, 08/26/2006,Awesome Vehicle,4,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is a great vehicle.  We have every option in it. It is very comfortable. The cooled seats are great in the South.  The remote start option is great for warming up the engine.  I love everything about it.
cadillac,escalade,2007,Anthony, 08/27/2006,Fantastic Vehicle!,4,I must say that Cadillac and GM got their act together when designing the new Escalade. We have the ESV model and nothing can come close to it. So far I can only say great things about this truck! It truly defies its size the way it accelerates and drives. It sounds like a muscle car from the outside and the 6.2 liter V8 loves to rev. The 6-speed auto is actually pretty good on gas on the highway. Its a bit thirsty around town but understand we are talking about an 8-passenger 3 ton vehicle here. If you need the room and are looking for a first class SUV there is nothing that compares to the Escalade!  Write the check and get one!
cadillac,escalade,2007,gap2006, 01/09/2007,About the AC,4,"I purchased my 2007 Cadillac Escalade in March '06 when it was first released and have put about 10,000 miles on it. It's been flawless in every way and all the tech gadgets work the way they are supposed to. As far as climate control, I already suffered through a long heat wave with temps above 100 and the AC performed flawlessly. You can start the car remotely and by the time you get in it it will have already cooled down considerably. Once you get in and blast the AC and ventilated seats you will be pretty cold. Anyway, I look forward to your feedback as to how it actually performs in your area. Good luck. "
cadillac,escalade,2007,jack cosgrove, 05/11/2007,Lux SUV,5,"The vehicle is nothing less than spectacular. I bought it for my wife who is totally enamored with the looks, ride and performance. I opted for the 20"" wheels, which saved acouple of bucks, and were a little unique, a good mix for ride quality."
cadillac,escalade,2007,john, 11/28/2007,Really bad,2,This is my second Escalade and I was really excited about it. I bought a fully loaded awd black black. The problem is the transmission feels as though it's going to fall out of the car....the wors shifting ever. I manually shifted to see what gear 4 and 5th are the worst. Also the 55 lbs seats...I mean come on...my 125lb wife has no chance at getting them in/out. This car really is disappointing and they will feel it.
cadillac,escalade,2007,Joe, 05/12/2020,This thing is Haunted,1,"Don't buy it! I have spent over 40 thousand dollars within 7 years of this thing, I replaced the Transmission twice, had to replace the top end of the engine, the shocks and compressor three times, motor mounts, had to replace the hubs 4 times, I've replaced the headlights 6 times and they still don't work, this truck eats breaks and tires like crazy, the TV's in the truck broke, the back up camera broke twice, the windshield wipers go on and off by themselves, the door handles broke 3 times, the heated seats don't work, the heater hoses broke 3 times, I did the ball joints 4 times, I did the u/joints twice, and much more. I swear this thing is possessed, I took it to a priest so he can do an exorcism on it but to no avail. If you do consider buying an escalade, buy stocks in OPEC, because this thing eats through gas, horrible gas mileage.

cadillac,escalade,2007,LW, 08/15/2006,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be. . .,2,"After test driving multiple Escalades over the past month, I have to say that I was completly let down.  While the exterior is absolutely stunning, the interior fails to impress.  The interior is not of solid construction at all.  Opening the center console I felt like I was going to break it, it is very shaky.  Overall the quality of the interior of the Cadillac just seemed very cheaply constructed to me.  The power of the engine also failed to impress me as well.  After driving it on the open interstate and flooring it a couple times, it just failed to impress."

It just plain has every feature and true luxury.  And all the features work well.  This car is a pleasure.  Much better than my old Lexus and Mercedes.
cadillac,escalade,2007,Lucas, 07/23/2009,First American full size SUV,4,"I sold my 2003 Infiniti Coupe for an 2007 Escalade fully loaded Black on Black with 60k miles for about $32k plus taxes and fees. I rented an 2009 from Hertz in Feb and I just had to have one of my own. This is a weekend car. I am 26yo, engaged and I wanted a car to sit 7 people. I got the extended warranty on it. Gas mileage in NYC driving is roughly 280 miles on 22gal without AC or spirited driving. Wind noise can be heard above 65MPH. At start-ups the rear back on the truck makes loud noise (electrical?) for about 30 seconds. But besides that it is great on the road, uneven pavement, and pot holes. Mine has the 18"" chrome wheel but I am looking to upgrade to the stock 22"". "
cadillac,escalade,2007,THEKID, 05/25/2007,Absolutely Horrible,2,"I have had this car for under a year, and I have never had a car need to go to service more in my life. I have had the brakes serviced 7 times already. It seems like one thing after another goes wrong, and for what you pay, I am horrified with the amount of time I have to deal getting the car serviced. I got it for the children, but what a mistake. I wish I had my 5 series back.  Please do not get this vechicle it is the worst waste of money!  The inside and exterior look is the only positive about this, but I want to be able to drive a car not just look at it in the driveway.  I hope this helps you all!"

The Escalade is a nice truck and it rides well, but the rearview camera has not worked right from day one.  ""Service rearview camera"" flashes on the screen when going from park into drive. The service staff at my Cadillac dealership are totally clueless and pretty much don't care. Maybe they will care when GM gets my survey. The truck only has 250 miles.  "

The horrible wind noise, and when we take it in for service they dont hear it.  The third row seats are very hard to fold up and take out, dont know if we would purchase a escalade again,  maybe we just got a rotten Apple from the orchard."

I had been driving a 2005 Acura MDX which I liked but with another kid on the way needed something bigger.  We found a great deal on a used Escalade and bought it on the spot.  It has every feature you could imagine and drives like a dream in the snow.  Very quiet ride and comfortable for every passenger.  I would highly recommend the auto running boards and heat/cool seats, and the nav with back up camera as it would be hard to see behind you without it!  This is a great SUV and my only wish is that it had a better console and of course better gas mileage.  "
cadillac,escalade,2007,love it, but,"Love it, but please change DVD/audio sys",4,"Absolutely the best SUV and has lived up to all of our greatest expectations over last 2 years.  Definitely recommend it.  I was 9 months pregnant during the test drives - it had the only comfortable seats (many A+ compliments to GM)!  Love the growl/purr of the engine, great looks, sporty handling & acceleration.  Only 1 gripe - hate the lawyer's version of the DVD/NAV/AUDIO.  It's ridiculous that you have to come to a complete stop to use many features (scroll XM stations, calls, destination, etc) when there is a passenger to do it without causing distraction for the driver. Could utilize the front on/off airbag switch to ""unfreeze"" the features while in motion.  Hate that on the highway!"

My 2nd favorite was the Pacifica but like comparing apples to oranges. My wife has an ML 320 that in no way compares to the Esclalade. I'd rather drive my son's Kia Sportage than her Mercedes.

Now Lexus and other luxury manufacturers have competition in the SUV segment.  Cadillac has shown a great improvement with the production of this ultimate large size SUV.  I am so glad to see that the brakes have also been improved.  The interior is also very nice.  I like the rear view camera.  I love its ride on road and also on off road.  It has the great power and torque.  Its 6 speed gear box is also quick responding.  I have taken this large size monster to the hottest area of my country and even at 52 degree centigrade my vehicle was able to travel at high speeds, I was surprised to see that from an SUV."

Let me tell you there is no comparison between the two.  The new Escalade is just built so much more solidly.  I am so glad that I choose this truck. I recommened it to any one looking for a real head turner.
cadillac,escalade,2007,Denice, 08/03/2006,Beautiful Ride,4,This Cadillac is an awesome car inside and out.  It has great power and all the luxury that you expect. The chrome on the exterior really makes it stand out. That was a big eye catcher for my husband and I. We are very happy with our Cadillac and have no regrets. I would tell anyone that likes Cadillac or SUVs that this is the vehicle for them. 
cadillac,escalade,2007,Ron, 02/14/2006,They Have a Winner,4,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade looks great and drives great.  Its new opitions have Cadillac written all over them.  The new Escalade is finally a true Cadillac.

To anyone who is looking for a luxury SUV, this is the vehicle for you!"
cadillac,escalade,2007,Mobb V, 02/20/2006,SUV of your Dreams,4,"I bought my 2007 Cadillac Escalade  three days ago and I couldn't be any happier. When I drove off the dealership parking lot I felt like I was in another world. This SUV is amazingly powerful and outstandingly comfortable. The mileage isn't as great as my old Tahoe had, but this truck gives you a lot for the money you pay. It has awesome electronic gadgets and a lot of room for anyone who wants to ride. I plan on modifying it a little bit to make it the true babe magnet. This SUV has totally made me the happiest person on earth."

cadillac,escalade,2007,HAPPY GUY, 07/18/2006,Awesome SUV,4,"I traded in my 2003 Escalade for the new '07 model.  When I first saw them I wasn't sold, but after a closer look and examining the interior, I was sold. This truck is great...it's scary how much Cadillac stepped up their game to compete with Lexus and Infiniti. The previous models had kiddie interior layouts but this layout meets the money that you pay for the truck. I am very pleased and have no regrets about spending the extra money."
cadillac,escalade,2007,LEK, 09/16/2006,Love it...,4,The new 50/50 body distribution of the Escalade makes for great handling and it stops on a dime. The third seat air curtain is great for those who are carrying extra passengers.  The Escalade even has a number of color options. It rides as smoothly as a sedan...
cadillac,escalade,2007,Dean, 10/19/2006,You've Gotta Have One of These...,4,"The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is one teriffic vehicle.  I puchased all the available options with no regret.  Finally, a car company not afraid to put in a remote engine starter as standard fair.  Don't even get me started on the awsome cooled seats.  I found about 15 little features that aren't even documented, did you know the heat/air fan automatically slows (quiets) when you make a phone call so the noise doesn't interfere with the call?  How about just touching the turn indicator for half a second and the turn indicator continues to flash 4 additional times. Cool stuff.  The ride in this vehicle is truly the best.  This truck is worth the expense.  I love the new look and interior."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Bill Williams, 12/20/2006,I'm Hooked,4,"This is my 4th Escalade, one was an EXT, the others are the AWD models. They consistently have shown very good quality, reliability, and performance. It still rides a bit harsher than I would like, but it handles reasonably well. I have been sufficiently impressed with this vehicle to keep coming back to ""the well.""  It's nice to drive something this nice that's built in this country, actually Arlington Texas. "
cadillac,escalade,2007,davo1103, 12/23/2006,Powerful Engine,4,The 2007 Cadillac Escalade is an excellent truck.  It has a great engine.  It needs more leg room in front and second rows though.
cadillac,escalade,2007,First Caddy Owner, 01/30/2007,Verdict's Still Out,3,"I bought this vehicle in April '06. I loved the new style. The remote start and remote lift gate are great! Navigation and XM radio also great. I also love the climate-controlled front seats, heated steering wheel, and heated rear seats. GM still can't figure out flat folding 3rd seats though! And no auto up windows? Come on!  Also, I hate that it has no telescoping steering wheel.  My driver door had rattle since day one. I have been to dealer five times, and they can't stop it. Now I have a vibration in the front dash, too.  And, the brakes squeak terribly in cool, damp weather! The dealer looked at them twice and says nothing can be done.  This is my fourth GM vehicle, but first with squeaky brakes - and it's a Caddy.  Overall, I like the vehicle, but am not sure that I'd get another one"
cadillac,escalade,2007,great blend, 01/28/2007,Perfect Blend,4,"I have the 2007 AWD Escalade and if I had to sum it up the words would be ""perfect blend."" This SUV has more power than any other I have driven, so when I read that it is under powered by other reviews I don't know what their comparing it to?  Maybe the Corvette.  The improvements in the interior is one the main reasons I bought this vehicle.  The nav system is very fast and full of information, while the Bose stereo system sounds incredible, the plasma screen DVD players in front and back are crystal clear.  I have the optional 22"" rims and to me this SUV still has a smooth ride and takes bumps well.  So I say to people who consider this SUV compare apples to apples and you won't be disappointed.  "
cadillac,escalade,2007,xcesshp, 09/26/2007,Segment Leader,4,"Purchased Dec'06 about 17000 miles so far. Only 2 issues, battery died first month, and heated seats didn't work even though cooled function worked, both fixed without further incident. The interior is user friendly and car-like, exudes luxury, huge improvement over previous generation. Very comfy seats. AC strong and cold in 100+ temps. 11mpg mixed 19mpg highway.  My particular truck doesn't suffer the excessive wind noise but did notice it on the loaner. Changing from a CLK55AMG overall pleased with the vehicle. No vehicle is perfect, everyone has different needs. For overall combination of size, power, handling, luxury and utility, this is currently the segment leader. "
cadillac,escalade,2007,Brandon James, 05/21/2007,'07 Escalade,4,"Had it for about 1 1/2 months. Drive it as often as I can. Always look forwad to getting into it. The ride is smooth, quite and comfortable. "
cadillac,escalade,2007,Tony, 05/20/2007,Denali is a better buy,3,"I love the interior and exterior. The transmission is jumpy/bangs at ""traffic/lower speeds"" (stop/go @ 10mph and less. I've averaged about 11.5 mpg and have about 5500 miles on the vehicle so far. The wind noise on the drivers side is very pronounced. I don't buy the excuse that it's the mirrors as it's not 1/2 as loud on the passengers side. Overall I wish I had stuck with a new Denali XL or gone with the Benz GL. "
cadillac,escalade,2007,Michael, 06/27/2007,Better than expected,4,"The new Escalade is extremely impressive with 400hp, creature comforts galore, and attractive styling. The comfort level of the new Escalade is extremely high. The seats are a little flat with little side support, but amazing seat warmers make up for it, same with the second row. The GPS and rear view camera system is the best I have ever experienced, even better than other Cadillacs. The styling is far better inside and out than all other competitors. The engine sounds great and has decent pull for such a large vehicle, even though the amazing engine suffers in fuel economy. I average about 12 with mostly city and the occasional highway."
cadillac,escalade,2007,thompsrw, 06/22/2007,Love it,4,"I've had my '07 now for about 3 months. All in all I love it. Reading through a few reviews made me worried because of the reliability etc. I've not had a single issue with mine. Only issue I have is the gas mileage. But lets be honest, we're not buying an SUV this size for gas mileage. Turning radius is incredible, speed and power is perfect and the looks both in and out are top of the line- bar none. Expensive but worth it. I've test driven and owned several other luxury SUV's - BMW, Navigator, Range Rover etc., and I'm still glad I bought it."
cadillac,escalade,2007,PS, 07/02/2007,2007 Escalade AWD,4,"This is my 4th Escalade. Overall good experience. Love driving this vehicle. However, 2007 model is the least comfortable to drive. Interior is lovely, but smaller that previous years."
cadillac,escalade,2007,jeffram, 08/18/2007,I have driven all SUVs,4,"I have had the LX470, Hummer h2 sut, test drove the Lincoln Navigator. The Lincoln was my second choice as I pull a boat and the LX470 is sorry to tow 6000 lbs. I went into the Caddy pessimistic because of the plastic wood and the uncomfortable seats and a stiffer than expected suspension.  My Hummer was smoother. The Navigator dash design is horrible and the rear entertainment system looks like an aftermarket install. The Escalade will grow on you.  It is the best SUV on the market. There isnt a better user friendly Nav entertainment system.  If you do not choose this option you are missing out!   I went in with a 2 year lease waiting for the new LX.  I am staying with Caddy!"
cadillac,escalade,2007,Hilbilly, 06/21/2007,Great Wheels,4,"Got my new 'Slade about a month ago. So far has 1000 miles. Love the power and comfort. The 403 hp enables me to quickly pass just about anything but a gas station. But I knew what I was in for and am pleasantly surprised by the highway mileage of 19 mpg. Around town it's less but that's the price you pay. Seats are very comfortable and long drives are no problem. Love the audio/nav system and the muted ride when the road is a bit rough. But it's still a truck. That said, there's absolutely no other vehicle Id rather have than this one. Three friend recently bought Toyota Sequoia, Lexus GX and Aston Martin. I'll take my Escalade over them any day."

cadillac,escalade,2007,Nick Slade, 10/05/2007,07 Escalade - great SUV,4,My only complaint was the noise from towing a trailer. The sound of the hitch rattling was transmited into the cab. The ride in the cabin is so quiet and refined. The sound of the trailer was very appparent.

I was going to get the new BMW X5, now I'm so glad that I got the Escalade instead.  This is by far the best SUV on the market - best looking, most power and everything you wanted inside.  My whole family loves it - my husband, my two little kids and of course myself.  I am exited to drive it everyday.  Yes, GM knows how to make an SUV!"
cadillac,escalade,2007,2Escalades, 11/21/2007,I bought a Luxury Truck!,4,"As this is now my second Escalade I do not believe as of now I will own anything else. Unless they come out with something that can beat the gas mileage. The exterior is great, the ride is amazing and all it takes is a small tap on the gas and you feel the 400 HP. As of right now GM has built a vehicle that is reliable and something that I know I can trust with my life and anyone that rides in it."
cadillac,escalade,2007,DB, 12/05/2007,So far so good,4,"Love the Escalade. As for mileage, I'm pretty used to spending more at the pump, already owning an SUV. However, it gets poor mpg. Living in the city I get roughly 10.3 mpg. The best Hwy mpg was 17.6; pretty much coasting downhill.  As for build quality, could be better for a luxury truck.  Overall, very satisfied with the Escalade. "
cadillac,escalade,2007,Jack Houston, 04/11/2008,First Escalade,4,"Most impressive appearance. (white diamond) Average 13 in town and 18 on trips. Had 98 Tahoe which this replaced. Ride much better and brakes improved.  Third row seat hard to remove when need to haul.  When in cruise control,  keeps down shifting.  Remote key won't work 50% of time.  Had to have AC valve replaced, as was giving heated air on drivers side."
cadillac,escalade,2007,Andrea in NY, 05/05/2008,I am on my 3rd Escalade,4,"I just ordered my 3rd new Cadillac Escalade, (all 3 were black)  I had the 04, 07, and my new 08 is in.  I absolutely love them.  I will keep on buying them too.  I have never had one engine problem with them.  I use OnStar often.  I find that the ""directions and connections"" thru OnStar more useful than the nav.  I also love the hands free phone.  The stereo is fantastic too.  I have a lead foot so I love the 400 hp.  It comes in handy often.  The factory 22's are worth every penny.  I have friends that tried to put on aftermarket 22's and the cannot get rid of the vibration.  I live in upstate NY and have left them on through the winter.  As long as you clean them, they are fine."
cadillac,escalade,2008,Concourse, 11/01/2007,BUYER BEWARE,2,"Transmission went bad with 2000 miles on it.After 5 attempts to have it fixed they finally found the problem.  It is an engineering flaw that GM said do not repair,there is no repair and it is on all 07 & 08 models. I'm crushed I paid $68k and no fix for Cadillac's engineering flaw, I asked them how much on trade they said $48k so a $20k loss on a problem that GM knows about and will not repair and will not warn potential buyers, how low can you go? Learn thru my mistake on trusting Cadiilac, and ask about this engineering flaw, the service dept. knows about it they have documents in their file that they can show you but you can't make a copy of it."

It is super comfy and I have had no issues with it other than a few nit picky cosmetic replacements. The engine and computer system have never given me any trouble. I would have expected a vehicle of this price range to come with blue tooth, but they did finally add it on the 2009. My favorite thing about this truck is the engine! I love that loud roar of my 6.2 liter when I crank it up. The 22"" wheels aren't to bad either! I have always felt safe driving it and long trips are easy. "

heated steering wheel went out a year ago ($900.00) to fix it..rear defrost has been serviced 4 times... i was told i should have bought an extended warranty...y would an $80,000 car need an extended warranty....i wouldnt sell this car to my enemy! and wait til u have to do general maintenance on it...$1500.00 easy!
im told this is all normal!"
cadillac,escalade,2008,bobby, 10/14/2008,Don't drink the Cadillac koolaid!,2,"This may be the nicest looking large SUV, however the trade off for reliability, build quality/materials, and lack of basic amenities leave this owner regretting every drive. I only have 7 thousand miles and the things spends more time at the dealer than my garage. GM clearly rushed this vehicle to market before it was done. The interior materials are cheap and not color matched. The metal is different colors and burns your hands. My door panels are turning purple from black. Only 2 windows auto down. the third seat is a pain to store. The onstar drops calls in the city, god forbid I need it out of town. Buy something else!"

Searched high and low for the most loaded and low mileage one I could find. I have now driven it nearly 20k miles, mostly back and forth from California to Arizona, and I absolutely love this truck. Its a dream to drive. True Cadillac luxury. Have not had one, single issue with it. Dealer even threw in 3 year 36k mile extended warranty as they were so confident in its reliability. In the past 6 years I have owned a Hummer H2, Yukon XL and a standard Yukon, and this Escalade is my pride and joy over those other vehicles. I would highly recommend the Escalade to anyone in the market for a used SUV."
cadillac,escalade,2008,Jack Kennedy, 05/22/2016,The SUV that catches your eye.,4,"I have always loved the Escalades. They are big, comfy, quick, safe, smooth, good looking, and spacious. They are a great car!!!!! There is one problem though. It's the chrome on the car. The Magnesium Chloride destroyed it!!!!!!!! We took it to trade it in and the vehicle runs great, probably one of the best running eight year old Escalades ever and it had 77000 miles on it when we took it to trade it in for a new one. The dealer offered us only $18000!!!!!!  The vehicle had to be worth $25000 or more. I also have an issue with the radio. If you turn the radio knob to the right, the radio channel goes the opposite direction. Same if you turn it to the left. It also freezes and glitches a lot. The quality of materials could be better. The dashboard is plastic and so are the door panels. Overall, I absolutely adore  this car and highly recommend it.

THE BAD ... Horrible fuel mileage (barely 11mpg), plastic door handles (c'mon really??), Rear windows go down half way (sucks for rear passengers), Rear passengers are always hitting their feet exiting (seat adjustment needed), 3rd row seating ever worse (passengers knees hit their chest)
THE UGLY ... Plastic (fake) wood grain interior panels are quick to get scratched and LOOKS horrible!!
Overall I like my Escalade, just wished I purchased an ESV instead. Full rear doors(windows roll ALL the way down) 3rdrow seating has more leg room plus you have cargo space"

cadillac,escalade,2008,BDC, 07/19/2010,Best Ride Ever!,4,"I just recently purchased my 2008 ESV Black and Chrome escalade.  I would never thought about purchasing a Cadillac Truck or any vehicle from Cadillac.  Once I saw the exterior and the interior I was a more than a little impressed however, once I took a test drive I was sold! This is one of the if not the smoothest drives you will ever have.  The way it shift gears and accelerate in speed is so smooth it is sweet! Everyone that sees my truck like it and everyone who test drives it love it.  It is really a dream truck!  (Just keep the warranty for annoying little repairs)."
cadillac,escalade,2008,Norm, 04/24/2008,2004 Model ESV was better,2,"My previous model ESV 2004, had features that I felt made it a luxury vehicle.  The 2008 seats are hard, do not hold you in position when cornering.  The sun visor is poor.  Previous model had more flexibility.   Headrest ability to bend forward is now seriously lacking.  I happened apparently to be one of the few people that used the disc changer system under random ALL.  Since the addition of the backup camera this feature has been removed.  This last item damed near stopped the purchase.  I now wish that I had purchased a Mercedes GL 550.  Which at this point in time will be my next purchase; and most likely sooner than later.  This is my 10th new Cadillac purchase in a row."

Inconvenient entry/exit of rear passengers. Loose fitting panels. doors fill with water when washed. Transmission shifting erratic, and unpredictable (dangerous when towing). Cheep chrome on wheels and roof racks. Too noisy for a Cadillac. Rear suspension leveling is week.  Flaws too many to list.  Were Cadillac's engineers drunk or just plane incompetent?? "

I traded in my 2004 Pearl White Escalade for this 08 Black beauty. I have all the bells on it as I did on the 2004! You cannot find a more comfortable car as the Escalade.  I get 14 mpg average with the 08 and did the same with the 04. I will always drive an Escalade."

Everything is covered in soft great smelling leather, including dash and doors and entire seats. Power is spot on and most of all ride has better control and smoothness than regular Escalade and Range Rover because of magna ride. Same suspension as Ferrari 599 and Chevy Corvette ZR1 and new Caddy CTS-V . Must drive on highway. It's an absolute dream. Let's buy American again, because GM is finaly making a perfect car and America's future is in our hands to keep American companies alive for a better future.  "

No mechanical issues experienced as noted by several previous postings.  It's fun to drive and does exactly what I expected when I bought it - looks great, drives great, and hauls as a big rig!"
cadillac,escalade,2008,domesticdude, 03/25/2008,Surprisingly good,4,"Cadillac is on a role, and the Escalade is no exception. It has great looks, lots of luxury and features, 403 hp, and an exhaust note from a muscle car. I never thought i would buy and SUV, but the Escalade sold itself. The power and exhaust note surprised me most as it is quick (for and SUV), and sounds great. The handling also really surprised me as it handles like a much smaller car. The only negatives i can fin is the old school tilt only steering wheel, third row seat ( everything about it from room to not power folding), and a light in the rear of the car rattles. The GPS in this car is absolutely fantastic, it is the highlight of an already great interior. Just a great SUV."
cadillac,escalade,2008,BK, 04/03/2008,Exactly what I expected,4,"I bought my first Cadillac in October of 07 and have been happy with the experience so far.  Exterior style is pretty much the best aspect of the car.  It's classy and has an edge.  The ride is luxury car smooth for the most part.  I don't feel tired most of the time I drive home from a long day at work. Fuel economy is average at best but I expected that.  At $3.10/gal a fill up is $60, which lasts me about a week. Build quality is as good as other luxury cars.  Lots of cheap plastic and panels that do squeak and come off.  It looks good though. Nav system is great.  Seats are comfy.  And caddy dealers are willing to deal a little for the car. All in all I'm very satisfied"
cadillac,escalade,2008,BUYUSA, 04/18/2008,Best SUV,4,"I love the Truck, The most impressive thing is the power, it moves, drives very smooth , the NAV is great very easy to follow, I traded up from a Ford Expedition..there is no comparison, this CADI is unreal, I test drove every SUV , the Range Rover and all, testes the CADI last and was sold instantly, Just go drive one! You'll buy one, if you can afford it!!"
cadillac,escalade,2008,Len Cannarozzi, 04/25/2008,Absolutely love it!,5,"This Caddy (ESV) is an absolute dream. The sheer presence is impressive. Everyone that sees this thing loves it. When quickly accelerating the exhaust reminds of the race cars in ""Days of Thunder"". What a sound - almost better than my Vet. When you enter the car at night, the lighting, both inside and out, are unbelievable. Everything about this vehicle exudes luxury.  I have read some complaints about the trans. But, I like the way it works. It tends to quickly go to the next gear. You have to go nearly 80 MPH to get to 2K PRM - an amazing engine. Still, if you're in hurry, you just need to punch it and it takes off.  Like the TV ad says, if the Escalade had a bathroom, I'd live in it."

cadillac,escalade,2008,jason , 07/14/2007,"Dont buy for looks, Has big problems",1,Mechanically this car is junk. It is a new engine transmission combo for GM and they definitely didn't nail this one. Maybe in a few years they can make it better. I have had both engine and transmission problems with it and it only has about 12000 miles. JD Powers has rated it a 2 star for mechanical quality and that is very generous of them. All the good reviews are just for 1st drives and the looks after you have it a little while you will see the poor quality of this vehicle! And this is coming from a GM man that has always liked and bought GM! 
cadillac,escalade,2008,R.Shoe., 09/22/2008,Don't waste your money,1,It is nice to drive and looks sharp. That is about it. Engineers must have been high when the interior was planned. The rear pass. windows don't roll down all the way. Was told GM makes these doors to small around the wheel well hence window rolls down 1/2 way - no it's not a safety thing. There are no pockets in the back side doors. No Storage. All of the seats are SO uncomfortable. They are like sitting on concrete. The third row seats have no place to put anything. For the third row both cup holders are on the left side of the car. There is a water leak in sun roof. Too many problems to list. No wonder GM is having financial problems.  
cadillac,escalade,2008,Josh, 07/22/2008,All looks no quality! Terrible vehicle,1,"I have owned 3 range rovers from 2005 up until 2008. I should have kept my range Rover. It's like going from a Porsche to a scooter. This car has no detail and terrible quality. The stitching is poorly done and everything looks like plastic. (wait! Is is all plastic, even the fake wood trim) from a side rear view the escalade looks ugly. The escalade idles very roughly. What do you expect from a gm I guess? Car was probably built in 15 mins. From robots. Good thing I lease this pile of junk cause range Rover is waiting for me."
cadillac,escalade,2008,Mike, 05/27/2008,66K Piece of Junk,2,"I loved the look of the new Escalade and alas that is all the car is. Just something good to look at. But it is a mechanical nightmare. This truck looks, drives and feels like it was put together in a hurry. I only have 2500 miles on it and the tranny bucks like a horse at least 3 times a day. Cadillac has reprogrammed some kind of computer but it keeps doing it and they say that there is nothing that they can do to fix it. It also idles very rough, the first month we had it it was fine and now it vibrates so badly at stop lights that it is embarrassing. Cadillac told me to use premium, I have and it still does it.Sometimes the power lift gate does not want to work. Should've gotten a 08 Sequoia"

We decided to roll the dice on GM after getting an unbelieveable deal on a lease. Now anyone doing homework on the Escalade knows this SUV has pros/cons. Reliability issues, possible wind noise, gas mileage...and while we liked the GL 320 & 450 the pricing was too good to pass up on the Caddy. Wife loves it. Tons of room inside, great rear-entertainment (unfortunately it blocks rear view mirror. No problems to date though. We love the curb appeal as well.  I will say anyone shopping an large SUV must check out the 08 Seqouia Platinum. Understated & loaded!"

GM does need to give this monster motor multi-displacement and possibly engine off at idle, but appreciate its ability to run on mid grade nicely and regular in a pinch with no problems.  3rd seat layout is a joke and it went in my mini storage the 2nd day. Exhaust note at idle and low rpm is absolutely beautiful! And at freeway speeds muffler tech. makes the hearty growl disappear (Huh, how'd they do that ?) I've got 6600 miles on this brute and oil life is still projected at 38% left. Pretty cool with factory oil, and it hasn't used a drop.So much more to praise; ride/sound/build/comfort/Power/etc qualities. Platinum model next"

I cant stop talking highly about my new truck, my GF loves it, all the girls love it. Fast & very athletic with the stock 22s. I was very happy that it did fit into my garage. Cant wait to take it snowboarding, and towing the bikes down south on those long trips.

BEAUTY: I truly love the vehicles luxury, style, class, and SIZE, there's nothing better offered by any manufacturer. But here is what I find missing, or don't like. 
1) No light in the glove box. 
2) No auto-down windows, except drivers door. 
3) Cheap battery. 
4) No telescope steering wheel.  
5) Small brakes.  
6) No independent suspension. NO BRAWN: 
7) The Escalade at 403HP is grossly underpowered. I am forced to switch the vehicle into tow-mode, to get higher revs out of each gear, in order for it to perform decently. Unfortunately, when in tow- mode, it down-shifts like a jake-brake!    "
cadillac,escalade,2008,z costello, 03/19/2010,Great SUV with a few quirks!,4,"I really do like my Escalade. However I am thankful it is still under warranty. I have had it in for several small but annoying reasons. Not sure why but the armrests become loose all the time. I had to get the center caps fixed do to squeaking issue. The radio/cd player will shut off every now and again for no apparent reason and the door latch became disconnected so you couldn't open the rear door from the inside. No, the child lock feature was not engaged. All problems were fixed but I only had 8000 miles on it when all this happened. The armrest issue seems to be the only problem that seems to not get handled. Other than that it's a great looking truck with tons of power. Would buy again"

With so many standard features like a voice- activated Navigation system, DVD entertainment system, a heated leather wrapped steering wheel with radio and climate controls, heated and cooled front and 2nd row seats, bucket seats, a universal garage door opener, and SO much more, this car will easily destroy competitors like the Lexus LX570 and Land Rover Range Rover, in luxury. The Honda Civic Sedan gets to 60mph in 11.3, this Escalade Platinum gets to 60 mph in 6.1; that's pretty impressive for any car and very impressive for a large SUV.

cadillac,escalade,2009,trk003, 11/20/2009,Car Seat - 3rd Row,3,We purchased this vehicle to accommodate our family size. Since the original purchase GM has redesigned seat belts in the 3rd row. Seat belts that accommodate a car seat will lock when pulled completely out to safely secure a car seat. 2008 ESV's had the ability to place car seats in 3rd row with a seat belt but in 2009 the belt was redesigned and includes 2010. Car seats can only be secured in the 2nd row. Please note the second row also has anchors for securing. Only 2 car seats can be secured in an Escalade ESV. Kind of a waste for vehicle size.
cadillac,escalade,2009,Tim, 07/14/2015,TERRIBLE QUALITY...,1,"... for something aesthetically pleasing. At the end of 2014 I purchased a used CPO 2009 Cadillac Escalade with ~53,000 miles. It was fully loaded. THANKFULLY, it has had all repairs still under warranty, However, the warrant expires in a month and I am seriously considering selling the car to avoid costly repairs. Since I have owned it for almost a year the following repairs have been needed: heating and ventilation front driver seat repair, front struts needed replaced, cables to and from battery replaced due to complete electrical system failure while driving, lumbar support driver's seat repair, right driver's side CV boot leak, side cover for moon roof replacement, tire pressure monitoring system constantly going on/off, and now battery draining overnight and auto-up/down on driver side window malfunctioning. 

The complete electrical failure while driving was the scariest. We experienced a complete electrical system failure while driving twice (i.e. NO POWER STEERING, NO ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, NO INJECTION OF FUEL INTO ENGINE). Thankfully, my wife and I were able to pull the vehicle over before an accident occurred. Cadillac replaced the cables going to and from the car battery which has seemingly remedied the issue. There are tons of forums of this occurring and how the NHTSA has not recalled the car because of this boggles my mind. 

Overall this car is a prime example of poor mechanical engineering. DO NOT PURCHASE this car if you value reliability or quality craftsmanship. Unfortunately, it was my wife's dream car, but it has been in the shop for more often than not and she has been unable to showcase its most valuable asset: aesthetics. I cannot imagine the cost that we will incur once the CPO warranty expires. For example, the cost to repair the driver's side heated and ventilated seat was just over $1,000. The Cadillac dealership near us charges $150 just to diagnose an issue. I guess this is what you get for a ""luxury"" vehicle. In comparison, I have owned a 2004 Lexus ES330 currently with 130,000 miles and the only maintenance I have performed are oil changes and new tires. I have owned it for 3 years when I purchased it with ~90,000 miles on it. Good luck Cadillac owners. I feel your pain

cadillac,escalade,2009,Doug, 08/18/2009,"Escalade, another Year, another Homerun",4,"This is my second Escalade and I continue to be impressed.  I've owned several luxury SUV's and the 2009 Escalade is an overall more enjoyable vehicle.  We currently also own a Mercedes ML500, the Escalade doesn't handle quite as well on cornering but otherwise the Escalade out performs and is everything you could ask for and more.  It is very well equipped from a luxury perspective, again comparing it to the ML500 the seats of the Escalade are comfortable but with the ML their are more adjustable area's of the seat so you can form it to your personal shape better. The navigation in the ML STINKS and the Escalade is a dream to use, view, etc -  Nice job Cadillac.I actually have reached 19 MPG"
cadillac,escalade,2009,Sean, 06/18/2010,Big mistake GM,2,"I have had nothing but problems. It isn't even one year old and the service engine light has gone of three (3) times withing a year. The problem is always fuel system or engine. Second, the not spacious, cheap interior angers me. Wobbly center console, loud, cheap tailgate, glove compartment has no room for owner's manual, you can hear the lumbar support cracking and bending inside the seat when you inflate it. The rear leg a/c didn't work, when I fold the seats I hear this cheap squeaking and all the doors can close without making the squeaking noise when there is no lubrication. Chrome is plastic. Don't waste $80,000 and buy a BMW or Mercedes SUV and you'll be pleased."

cadillac,escalade,2010,Jnick, 09/14/2018,Crap are Us,3,Run don'walk away from this.  This car has been nothing but a headache.  This is our second one. The first was a 2000 and now we have 2010.  You would think they would take some clues from the first one and get it right.  The dash board is light up like a Christmas Tree and so was the 2000.  This car is not worth the materials they put in it to build it.   High Maintenance cost and you will have them often.  Built for appearance not performance.
cadillac,escalade,2010,NJB, 09/22/2010,Little Legs,3,"You'll need little legs if you buy the huge Escalade.  Actually had an agreement on an 07 ESV in late 2008 but dealer sold it out from under me.  OK since by that time, I realized the tiny, non-adjustable rear seats were almost deal-breakers anyway.  No, not the third row small, nonadjustable seats - the SECOND row.  My $30k 06 Pilot had more rear legroom and it has seats that move fore and aft, unlike the $70k Escalade.  Cool looking as the Escalade is, the QX56 is more usable and we're getting that.  I'm surprised you mention Land Rover as an option: Land Rovers have the #1 disparity between perceived quality and actual quality - they're bad trucks but great for poseurs!"

Selling features on this one were Magnetic ride control, active fuel mgmt (4/8 cyl), front side airbags standard. RE the ride control - only thing I notice is slightly faster transmission of road variation. It' certainly a more ""euro"" feel, frankly out of place in such an SUV as this. Active fuel mgmt is a total joke - I got better mileage with my '08 (but, only 500 miles so far in this one). And guess what? No more rain sensing wipers and no more heated washer fluid (I'm from Wyoming - needed that hot washer fluid!). There's more, but the crowning blow came when transferring OnStar - you can't keep your old number!! "

Of the Cadillac and the road, it should be built far better than the Tahoe/Yukon? Not ! The biggest pc of crap! I have ever owned! Within 8 months it was in the shop about 12 times for all sorts of problems. Worst was the engine cut off while driving on interstate. Super dangerous vehicle! Took it in and there must have been 5 escalades in shop for shadow problems of mine. Purchased a Volvo xc70 loaded and freaking love it!"
cadillac,escalade,2010,Sergio, 04/10/2010,Escalade,4,"We had first looked at the 06 Escalade but didn't like it. We went with the Mercedes R350, but when it was time to change, the styling was a turnoff compared to the GL. So we went with the Gl450. It has a great third row, but the bench seat is a turnoff. So we decided it was time for a new luxury SUV, with captain chairs, leaving us to the Navigator, extremely bold, the QX56, in which the redesign didn't thrill us but was a near choice, or the Escalade. By far the styling is great and overall i am pleased with it. It has AWD, which I need, and is VERY difficult to get in Florida."

cadillac,escalade,2012,jmuh212, 01/20/2013,First Escalade,4,"We bought this amazing SUV last summer after trading in our Enclave. Needless to say, we will not be going back! The Escalade is exactly what I expected it to be and more! The only down side about the Escalade is ride comfort. Even with the new magnetic ride control it has improved, but is not up to par with other SUV's in its class such as the Mercedes GL-Class. Other than the ride, it's amazing!"
cadillac,escalade,2012,rydan93, 11/06/2012,This is my 3rd Escalade I looove this truck!,5,"I can't begin to describe how much I love this vehicle. Under diress from my husband, I sold my 2008 Escalade and went to a Buick Enclave. While the Enclave is a wonderful vehicle and extremely smooth ride, after 15 mths, I missed my big gas gusseling SUV! I missed the 6.2 liter engine. If you've ever owned an Escalade before, its very hard to go down(in size and performance)to anything else. I had been spoiled and continued to complain about letting him talk me into getting rid of my '08 Escalade which never gave me a lick of trouble. So, the stars aligned and he went and got me another Escalade. A newer, nicer one than I had before! All is right in the universe again!"

cadillac,escalade,2015,Mike, 01/12/2018,Drop it like its hot....(the car value),3,"Bought the 2015i Escalade (""i"" indicates the new version with the new logo badge) for about 86k new.  Looked to check the value of the vehicle and its around 50k in immaculate condition; first issue: truck does not hold its value.  During my time, the Escalade has had its share of issues, to which the dealership was more than happy to resolve since it was under warranty.  However, some of the issues out of the gate were fairly major.  For example, my transmission was changed 1 year into the purchase (never got a full explanation on this one), airbags needed to be serviced, CUE system has been changed twice due to malfunctions like rebooting during use and turning bright green at times, and many, many small issues here and there.  Unfortunately, these repairs were not lemon-able because they were all different, but on the upside I did get a try a wide variety of Cadillac cars through their loaner program.  Other small issues like cabin noise and vibrations were similar to what I experienced in my Chevy Tahoe, except the Tahoe was around 40k and not exactly a premium vehicle.  My recommendation, the Escalade struggles to compete with similarly priced SUVs; you are better off looking elsewhere or buying used.

The time had come for something new so we naturally opted for a brand new Escalade Platinum SUV. Very long story short, the car began having issues almost immediately and has been back to the dealership more than a dozen times. We've had over two dozen separate issues. The dealership has done their best but the factory refuses to take the car back, even though many of the issues continue. Can't wait until the lease is up. We will NEVER own another Cadillac.

cadillac,escalade,2015,Jack Kennedy, 01/24/2016,BEST CAR BUT...................,4,"The Cadillac Escalade is stylish, fast, comfortable, safe, and it has a nice grumble from the 6.2L V8. But there is a MASSIVE FLAW. It's the CUE system. The CUE system is the worst infotainment system ever. Sometimes it won't even come on when you start the car! It can take up to 6 blocks for it to turn on. The response is slow, voice commands can be frustrating and it glitches a lot. I also don't like the sliding things to turn the volume up or turn the AC on. I like knobs. The headlights can be a little too bright and people think your high beams are on. Also the turn signals on the mirrors can be blinding at night. But the tail lights are INCREDIBLE. It lights up the whole street!! The gas mileage is great for an SUV like this. The DVD player in the rear is great too. I love the power fold down seats. Mountain driving is one of the best places to drive it. It flies up the hills and I love the hill decent braking. Overall I expected more when paying $93000 for this beast. When I Kelley Blue Booked it, it said it was worth $70000 and it only has 8300 miles on it. The Escalade is the perfect family hauler, it is safe, cool, and I don't think there is anything on the road like it. We have had four Escalades and they all are great. The reason we keep buying them is because it saved my brothers life in a car accident and the vehicle was totaled. It took one for the team. So if you were looking at a big burly safe SUV, the Escalade is a great choice.

cadillac,escalade,2015,Melissa S., 09/29/2016,Stay away from this vehicle,2,"We have owned our vehicle since August 2015.  We have had problems since the first day.  Bad airbags, steering wheel had to be replaced 3 times, steering column replaced, torque converter replaced, front camera replaced.  The MAIN issue is still not fixed after many many many trips to Service. There is a rough idle at any stop.  The engine idle is so rough that the RPM's bar is moving up and down while the car is stopped.  At times it feels like the car is going to shut off.  Cadillac is not accepting responsibility and is saying this is NORMAL.  So...if you like a rough idle in a $100,000 Luxury vehicle go ahead and buy this SUV.  Otherwise, I would suggest you go down the road and find a different luxury vehicle.

cadillac,escalade,2015,G3, 08/24/2019,The worst vehicle ever!,1,"My family has owned Cadillac's even before I was born, so it was a no brainer that getting this vehicle I thought would be cream of the crop. I didn't have it for 2 weeks and into the shop it went. Sunroof was leaking water and CUE (radio) would just go black. Received the vehicle back and thought all was well but it was not. The radio went black as you would drive and sunroof was still leaking, as well as now the transmission seems like it was shifting. The dealership replaced the radio, said they added fluids to the transmission and that the rubber around the sunroof needed to be replaced. After a month the radio started going out again so now a third radio was put in. Not even 2 miles after I leave the dealership the third brand new radio went black again. I called the dealership they claim it must be something else as to why this was occurring. They did not have an appointment until 2 week out. At that time my air stopped working and being in a big suv with 85-95 degree weather with no air is not fun at all! This vehicle has been in the shop over 5 times and I have only had it for 6 months and when I called to see what the update was they haven't even started working on it. I called other GM dealerships to see if they would work on it and they told me it had to be a Cadillac dealer. I am highly disappointed in GM, Cadillac and Mary Barra (president of GM) as this is supposed to be one of the best and top of the line GM vehicles and I haven't even had the chance to thoroughly enjoy it. This will be my last GM vehicle as I will never purchase from them again!

My wife and I were just shopping for an upgrade of our current 2010 Denali. We looked at the Escalade, we were swept off our feet and signed the paperwork that night. This vehicle is nothing short of amazing. I never in my wildest dreams thought I would get a back massage while cruising at 75 mph down the interstate.
  We are still discovering the latest gadgets and taking it in tomorrow to have upgraded software installed to integrate our phones for easier applications of usage. Another plus, we got an astounding average of 26mpg at 70 mph last weekend on a road trip.
  The down side is that the apative cruse control would go offline going down the highway due to an error in the system. That is going to be addressed tomorrow also.
  As far as buyers remorse, it's nonexistent here folks.
"
cadillac,escalade,2016,S.Alexander, 10/08/2016,Presence like no other SUV!,4,"I owned a previous generation Escalade and the new model is a huge improvement over the old one.  Interior is very luxurious, and looks way better than GLS or Q7.  Old model was Rear or AWD only, and now you can get 4WD, and use it in rear wheel drive mode (or automatic or permanent 4WD) for everyday driving.  No need to use 4WD for summer driving and waste gas.   As a result fuel economy improved substantially, I get 16 mpg in the city and up to 26 mpg highway.  Apple CarPlay adds a nice touch and all electronics and navigation look/work perfectly fine.  My complaints would be lack of a sunroof in the base trim ($76K), and even if you get a model with a sunroof, it's a small one.  Panoramic roof is not available. Magnetic ride is awesome and very smooth, however, once you hit a rough pavement, the ride becomes very jittery. Handling is very confident and acceleration is very good, but, try to change lanes quickly at highway speeds, and you will be quickly reminded that you drive a huge truck. Overall driving feeling is very confident, you won't be bothered by snow, heavy rain or any other nonsense. In the end, I decided to get this car for its unique look and presence.  Park it next to Audi Q7 or MB GLS and see for yourself.  Q7 looks like a station wagon/minivan from the side, and GLS looks very unassuming and small next to the Escalade's huge grill and glowing vertical LED lights.  Euro competition may offer better ride and some technical advances, but Escalade brings such unique and unrivaled presence - it is still the king of SUVs.

cadillac,escalade,2016,Libby, 08/18/2018,2016 Escalade sucks.,3,"Escalades have been our choice of family car for years and years. We have three daughters that are competitive cheerleaders— therefor we travel A LOT. Classy, stylish, comfortable, easy to drive, always a looker— pretty much perfect... until this model. The jerk and the harsh gear changes are terrible- and also it shakes sometimes like your going off the interstate and hitting the little bumps on the line. We’ve taken it in several times (an hour away from our house) basically nothing changes- The process Cadillac is requiring is an absolute JOKE.. try this, try that...basically to waste your time and not have to address THIER issues. By the time you’ve taken your car in to meet there “requirements” of their “process” it’s already a few years old and ready to be traded in. They know exactly what they are doing. It’s actually very very very disappointing how Cadillac has handled this... and it’s not just my car- according the the internet it’s a very common thing. Shame on you Cadillac, makes me sad that I have to buy another brand. It’s understandable that things happen— it sucks, but it’s life. What’s unacceptable is they way they’ve handled their mistakes.

cadillac,escalade,2016,Chris, 10/18/2019,Electronic nightmare,3,"Had the 2016 Escalade as a lease.  From day one this truck was an electronic nightmare.  It spent more time at the dealership and I wasted many, many lease miles bringing it back to the dealership for repair.  Liftgate failed far too many times.  Battery failed in the first 4 months of ownership.  Heat in the back would constantly reset itself to highest temp so the kids would be overheated in the back set.  AC failed.  I would be driving and the entire console would go out and come back on, with rpms all over the place.  Cadillac could never figure out why so it became something I had to deal with.  When driving it would feel like steering would go out for a few seconds which was very scary.  Had one instance when I could not shut off truck.  I had to let it run the entire night until Cadillac could pick it up the next morning.  Sensors worked sometimes, other times oversensitive, sometimes not at all.  Nothing like going through a toll booth and having truck slam on its brakes every time, thinking I was going to hit something.  Cadiallac's answer was to shut off the feature. Some of the issues I honestly could have dealt with had Cadillac been responsible and dealt with the repairs in an honest manner but every time I brought the truck in for one repair, I would leave dealership with another problem so it became nothing but a headache.  The Escalade is a beautiful truck, roomy comfortable interior with all the bells and whistles, but honestly with all the problems I had, it does not justify the price.  I am now the proud owner of a Lincoln.
"
cadillac,escalade,2016,GM-vs-Euro, 05/05/2016,Nice but Not Refined compared to Euro SUV,4,"The Escalade is a luxury truck in my opinion; even the huge column gear shifter reminds me of a Chevy Truck.  Despite the plush seats and upscale interior, the ride has many jitters from road bumps, engine drones, and the transmission drones under acceleration. If you have ever owned a truck then you know what I mean.  If you are transitioning from European vehicles you will not like this unrefined beast in many aspects.  

Despite the unrefined integration of all its bells and whistles, the Escalade makes a strong presence with its huge size, powerful engine, big LED taillights and headlights.  Maneuvering into a normal parking spot can be a challenge, especially in an indoor garage.  The front, rear, and top down view cameras do help with parking.  I love the feature that vibrates your seat to warn you before you back into an obstacle.   

Road handling is its strength. This beast can handle every road condition because it is really a truck.  But riding in a truck with plush seats and interiors still can't trick your senses into believing that you are not in a truck.  The high pressure suspension doesn't have very good rebound damping.   When the suspension jitters are triggered, it resonates throughout the car.  It doesn't give you a muted and dampened ride that you get from an Audi Q7 or Mercedes GL.

The GPS and radio has a nice big screen but it is tilted in a strange angle. The buttons are intuitive but again not refined like European or Japanese entertainment systems.  Also, I wished the GPS map has a way of displaying on the large LCD dash display while the car is in motion.  The Escalade only lets you see small arrows and turn instructions on the dash and on the minimalist HUD display.  The audio system has clear sounds, and the interior is quiet enough even when blasting down the freeway at 80mph, as long as the road is smooth and you don't trigger the suspension jitter from poor road conditions.  I also like the air vented and massaging seat.  The lane departure control that vibrates your seat as a warning is a nice touch.  

Having owned a Z06 Vette, and now got a chance to experience the Escalade, my complaints about high-end GM products are the same, un-refined interior.  Unless you need the SIZE of the Escalade, an European SUV is much nicer to live with.
"
cadillac,escalade,2016,Mark, 01/04/2020,My family loves this vehicle,5,"My Escalade has about 45,000 miles on it now.  We have the Platinum edition in the esv with four wheel drive.  Let me start with the exterior.  This thing is sexy.  Sleek, aggressive, big and bold.  Even after all these miles I still smile when I see it.  I have the Pearl white.  I think I would prefer standard bright white when I do it again.  It looks even better in the winter with the ski racks on top nice tough appearance.  Inside this thing is big roomy and comfortable.  Third row seat could use more leg room.  But not bad.  The ESV model leaves an enormous amount of storage behind the third-row seat. Very nice for my family of 6. Plenty of legroom for me at 6'3'' and my taller than average teenagers.  I didn't know how much I would like the CUE system at first.  But once you learn it and the touch style buttons you learn to love them.  4 TV's, 360 degree cameras, adaptive cruise control, and massaging front seats are all wonderful.  The biggest reason I went with the Cadillac was for the towing. General motors 6.2L in this SUV is amazing. We use it as a daily driver. A long road trip family hauler. But we also use it to either hall the camp trailer to the mountains or the boat to the lake.  0 to 60 in this little baby is fun and almost scary. Towing is strong and impressive. but most impressively the fuel economy is mind-blowing on this size of an engine. we live out west where speed limits on the freeway are often 80 miles an hour and this vehicle will consistently get 19 miles per gallon at 80 to 90 miles an hour.  I looked at several luxury SUVs while making my decision. Frankly the only other one that worked well for my family would have been the Lincoln extended version, it's nicely equipped little brother the expedition Platinum, or the GM little brother in the GMC Denali.  I looked at the BMWs Mercedes Land rovers etc.  Nice vehicles. Towing capacity on paper is pretty good. Almost every situation these European rigs towing could not handle very much tongue weight from a trailer and even though they were rated to tow enough, almost every European option felt like it was being overworked with just my wakeboard boat at a mere 6500lbs. Also much smaller inside and almost zero cargo capacity behind the third-row seats.  Towing was the same behind Denali and felt really good behind the Ford.  Denali was short a couple of fun options and Ford/Lincoln Ecoboost felt like it had plenty of power but the towing fuel economy indicated it was working pretty hard.  one thing that goes unsaid in a lot of these reviews is how amazing the headlights are on this vehicle. Driving down the freeway they will light up for 5 Lanes of traffic on low beam setting. Wonderful.  I know we are only less than 50,000 miles in but we have had zero electrical and zero transmission problems with this vehicle.  I have read those are the two biggest complaints.  All that being said if you are looking for something easier to park, give up the extra cargo space and get a smaller European SUV. If you are looking for a ton of 3rd row legroom look at the Ford. For my family and our lifestyle this thing is dang near perfect.  I do prefer the steering wheel button layout on the Denali and also that the Denali comes with an integrated trailer brake controller.  On my model year Denali did not have 360 degree cameras or massaging front seats and maybe a couple other options.

cadillac,escalade,2016,Roger Lake, 03/19/2018,Worst Car I have ever owned!,1,"Ok we will start with the PRO:  Looks and cargo space.  That’s all.  Now the Con:  First off I want to start off by saying I own a car dealership and have personally owned every type of vehicle their is.  This truck is the worst vehicle by far that I have ever owned.  The engine burns oil at 11k miles. Brought it in to the GM dealer and they hand me a paper stating that it’s acceptable to burn up too a quart of oil between oil changes. 92,000 dollar vehicle and Iam adding oil between oil changes?  The transmission shifts horrible and slams into gear every day I pull out of my garage.  Going up hills the truck loses power and seems to not know what geat to go into.  Also my wife and I smell coolant in the car when you first turn on the ac as if the heater core is leaking.  We paid extra for power running boards and they Stick.  Truck rides ruff and clunky.  It’s a real shame because we sell used Cadillacs on our lot and the older ones were much better.  I feel the quality of a Hyundai or Kia far exceeds the quality of this truck.  I have never went on and reviewed a car or truck in my life as all vehicles have their issues but this truck has so many problems that even though it’s so pretty this truck makes me so angry and Iam so laid back.  I don’t care how much money you have this truck will be your worst financial decision you have ever made in your life if you buy it.  No redeemable features other then size and beauty. I had to go jump start this truck the third day of owing it because the battery was no good.  And I remind you we bought it brand new with no miles.  I don’t have time to go to the dealer every week because of all the problems.  We can’t even drive the truck we’re paying so much money to have.  The dealer wants to give us a Chevy Cruze as a loaner car every time.  We bought this truck because we have a big family.  I end up putting a dealer plate on a Honda Pilot and have my wife drive that.  So basically buy a Honda Pilot to drive when your Cadillac is broken down and in the shop every week.  If I could give this review negative stars I would.  Nothing in my life has disappointment more then this vehicle.  Buy German or Japanese the quality it much better.

We've owned it for nearly 4 years and it's in the shop about 8x per year for everything under the warranty.  They had to replace the computer board a few times as the vehicle just shut down on her.  Many things have been replaced on the SUV.  We only have 40k miles on the car, but my wife has the serviceman's cell number.  It's really not worth the price when you can buy a Toyota, Lexus or BMW and not have to take it to the shop every few months.  It's what I expected, but now my wife never wants a Cadillac again.  I've talked to other owners and they are not that impressed and have had similar experiences.  Highly NOT recommend.

cadillac,escalade,2016,VictoriaBC, 08/13/2020,2016 Escalade Platinum - WORST PURCHASE EVER!!!!!,1,"We ordered the 2016 Platinum Escalade with every option possible.  We spent over $120K (we are in Canada).  This thing has been terrible from day 1. Our local dealer here in Victoria, BC (Wheaton, Cadilallac GMC) was no help either, after the sale they didn't give a crap about us! We have a laundry list of things that have gone wrong with it, including the entire AC unit had to be replaced (after going back and forth with the dealer - I self diagnosed the problem after reading forums - and tracked down the parts myself!!! to get them to fix it... it was UNDER WARRANTY - yet I had to do this).   The SUV is currently in the shop right now, I was informed yesterday that the repair bill is pushing $8,0000 plus TAX!! The SUV is 4 years old and the extended warranty that I paid $2800 for just expired because it has just over 100km (62,000 miles)!  Apparently the front air ride system has failed and it needs a new radiator brakes and rotors.. It has been shifting HARD since day 1 (embarrassing to be honest - it JERKS hard at low speeds) and they just said that its normal... There is nothing normal about it!  I called Cadillac, only to be put on hold for 30 minutes I finally opted to leave a message, we'll see if I get a call back.  They DO NOT VALUE their customers..   PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!! 

After reading the other reviews, our problems are very similar, which makes me very concerned for the future of this vehicle. I wish I could have read these reviews before purchasing.  I have been a faithful GM customer all of my life (1969 Camaro, 1967 Camaro, 2008 Chevy Duramax 2500, 2009 Hummer SUT, 2012 Cadillac Escalade Hybrid, 2010 Chevy 3500 Duamax Dually, 2016 Cadillac Escalade)  After the way I've been treated by GM, I will NEVER BUY or RECOMMEND A GM PRODUCT.

Dealership keep giving me the run around with an answer. Air condition stopped working. First two times reports of faulty freon this time they have no clue. Won't replace my brand new car but can't find the problem. I would suggest BMW X5 which I should have bought in the beginning now I'm stuck with this clunker

cadillac,escalade,2017,SPORTOURISTA, 07/04/2017,"A Roll of the Dice, Nice surprise!",5,"After driving foreign SUVS for over 20 years (mostly German), this time I decided  to try something different. I wanted more room, larger towing capacity, 4WD/AWD, and a nicer interior. After 2000 miles in an ESV 4WD Luxury, a new surprise emerges everyday. It has a beautiful interior, nice fit and finish, tons of electronic safety features and the oft-criticized CUE infotainment system. I am pleased and surprised with the ride quality of the suspension and 22"" wheels.  The sophisticated electronically controlled shock technology may be the reason. I have not found the CUE system overly complicated. There is a lot to learn here, but most of the controls seem logical and useful, if you are patient and read the owner's manual.  The interior's low noise level is impressive as is the standard Bose designed sound system.  A big surprise is the weight of this vehicle of this vehicle compared to its European competitors, ie., the M-B GL series and the large Range Rover. They all weigh in the 5700-6000 lb. range.  Cadillac has used a lot of aluminum and lightweight high strength steel based on my research. I like the ability to run less expensive regular or mid-grade gas, (which is acceptable) although premium is recommended. Mileage so far has been slightly less than the EPA estimates.  So far I have only towed my 6000 lb. boat for about 200 miles. The torque and H.P of this model's drive train seemed unfazed with the task. And the room in the rear cargo area is huge. This is a large vehicle, but it doesn't feel that way from the driver's seat or in its handling prowess. It also has a very tight turning radius. So what is there to not like? Keeping in mind the concept of this vehicle and the reason I bought it, I haven't found much to dislike yet, but I'll keep looking. Most owners that I have talked to, love their vehicles and without hesitation would buy another one.  Enough said!

cadillac,escalade,2017,Patrick R. Blasz, 11/14/2017,truly a great luxury suv,5,"We purchased this vehicle in july 2017 and have put 6K miles on it. The mpg can easily exceed the epa (needs to be dismantled) estimates. The best is 30.7. You will read much by the professional motor media, about the same caliber of journalism as the rest of the media, parroting that the ride is harsh. Utter nonsense. These people are checking with one another to see what the consensus while be. Disregard them. We have purchased a range rover and the Escalade is a nicer vehicle in many regards. The solid rear axle is advantageous for the high tow rating. While the RR has better off road capabilities and is a wonderful vehicle, the Escalade has other attributes to stack up to any large SUV. Cadillac has done a wonderful job with this vehicle. We purchased it over the competition for the third row seat and the retractable running boards. These running boards are far far better than any fixed running board. So, forget the ""professional"" reviews, try it, you will like it.

cadillac,escalade,2017,Brett R, 11/05/2018,Awesome SUV when not in the shop,4,"Pros: Great looks, smooth ride, great handling (like a sedan), comfortable interior. Cons:  Reliability is now a concern with two major issues in under two years. 1) Instrumentation dashboard went out completely after about 1 year so you couldn't see your speed, gas tank, or any of the vitals.  Unfortunately this happened while traveling out of state.  2) At just under 2 years, Escalade is now in the shop for an issue where the transmission lunges and makes a noise.  TBD but Cadillac thinks it is a transmission issue.  I'd be OK with minor nagging issues but for the priciest car I've ever purchased I shouldn't have major issues and I'm disappointed. In addition, not a huge fan of the entertainment interface. Too complex and not user friendly for simple things like volume control (stick with knobs vs. having to swipe left to right).

cadillac,escalade,2017,Bob Thompson, 03/23/2019,Forget the rest and drive the BEST !!!,5,"This is my second new Escalade, 10 years apart.  The ride is so much improved from the 2007 to the 2017.  Both of my Escalades have been the Luxury model as they have the same seats, suspension, inflatable front and side air bags, 22"" wheels and tires, power folding third row seating, good looking LED exterior headlamps and tail lamps, entertainment qualities, and quiet ride, that are included with the Premier and Platinum series, but cost thousands of dollars less.  They are beautifully styled, with easily recognizable tail lamps that are stylish, as well as highly visible.  From the new grille, new dash, large back-up camera screen, front and rear parking sensors, to the puddle lamps on the bottom of the exterior mirrors, Cadillac's engineers remembered to include everything that they would want, if they were shopping for a new SUV.  Drive one today and you will see that I am right.

I am a conservative person and I did not want to be associated with the image.  However, the new design caught my attention, no artificial gills and a really nice looking SUV.  I don't mind the truck frame lineage, I like the durability and toughness aspect of the design.  I really bought it to carry around my grand children and I want them protected.  However, it is entertaining and I really like driving it.  The price of entry is steep, but the look of the Tahoe or GMC versions did not visually appeal to me.  I like the way this SUV looks and I feel good driving it.  I could have bought any SUV, but I am a guy and this one appealed to me.  I have had no issues and have about 10K miles on the truck.

The transmission does not shift properly.  In fact, the dealer replaced the original transmission at 3000 miles.  The mounts have also had to be replaced as well as other parts.  The controls are difficult to maneuver.  Cadillac customer service in Detroit is the worst anywhere.  They never acknowledge any problem, do not attempt to repair anything, and then ask you if you are satisfied.  We are in the process of having our arbitration hearing as part of the lemon law process.  The Escalade has been at the service shop for almost 60 days over six visits in just 11 months.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the reviews.  Do not buy or lease an Escalade or any GM product.

I was given a so called ""upgrade"" from a rental agency recently.  I've driven extended cab/bed pickup trucks and other large vehicles before, but I really didnt like the Escalade.  Oh sure, that's lots of bells and whistles and gadgets, but that didn't impress me.  I was travelling with my wife and 3 of our kids.  When we opened the back to load our luggage I was dismayed to see less than a foot or cargo space.  We had to put down a seat and stack the luggage to fit.  I would have gladly taken a minivan or sedan over the Escalade.

My other SUV is a 97 Lexus LX450 with 165000 mi and I have not had to replace or fix anything major.

cadillac,escalade-esv,2004,johnj, 07/12/2008,GM Let Down,3,"I purchased this vehicle with the understanding that it was Cadillac Certified with the extended warranty unfortunately the dealer ripped me off and there is no warranty.  While Cadillac is a good product there are too many parts as pieces that can break.  I have had the car in for warranty work 5 times in the last 10 months, nothing major but it will add up as soon as the original warranty runs out.  The vehicle is still under the original warranty for another month but after that I am out of luck after that thanks to a dishonest dealer and GM customer service unwilling to do anything about it.  Beside that I think it is a good vehicle but lacks a lot of features of the new models."

Sure you may pay a bit more, however you get a lot more. And you truely get what you pay for.

has the comfort and refinement that 
you'd expect from a premium SUV, but is 
also rugged and can handle agressive

returned from a long road trip and it 
was like staying at a 5 star hotel with 
wheels.  The HVAC system is great.  The 
entertainment system was a big hit with 
the kids (big & little), and the XM 
satellite radio keeps you entertained 
even where there is little or no AM/FM 
signal.  The navigation system and 
OnStar are outstanding.  Take it from

Everyone at my daughter's class loves to ride in it and blast music or watch a DVD.  I can't wait to get an '07 or '08 when my lease expires!

When it engages, it sets you back in the seat and lets you know but it does it gently, not like my previous 1999 Suburban with a 5.7L. More plush over bumps, on turns, and acceleration. The ammenities are overwhelming compared to a Suburban, and it feels like you got what you paid for. "

The longer body style has improve for long hauling then the short body style.  My 2004 Caddy does not have the DVD entertainment, but does have everything else i.e. navigation, satellite radio, CD player and a decent radio. Now that analog has become extinct OnStar and the other related emergency connections are useless.  Vehicle has great ""get up and go power!"" Navigation CD is now outdated there is no new CD for the 2004 system to update, what a joke. Have not tried this vehicle off road, but in some of the heavy snow falls in the North East it out performed it self. It's just okay!"

So I bought another full sized Chevy SUV. At first I was very happy! The  truck performs above and beyond! Looks hotter than any other truck out there.  The bad. Had to replace the transfer case at 65,000 miles, tire sensor at 60k, a $350 shock at 72,000 miles while doing xcountry road trip, heated and cooled seats went up front, brake caliper seizes up! Cup holder doors wouldn't close, had to call Cadillac since it was on back order. Steering makes noise in front. Navi gets confused sometimes. No factory cross members! Seriously on a platinum edition"

cadillac,escalade-esv,2005,BillyG, 11/13/2005,Well Worth the Money,4,I have had a Chevrolet Suburban and a GMC Yukon XL and neither compare to the Cadillac Escalade ESV.  It is a very expensive SUV but it is well worth the extra money.  The only negative is the gas mileage but I knew that before buying.  I strongly recommend buying to anyone considering the Escalade ESV.
cadillac,escalade-esv,2005,Charles, 06/10/2005,Excalade ESV,5,"If there was anything I felt was better than my Cadillac Escalade ESV I'd have bought it.  The only real problem I have with this truck is that, for the cost of this vehicle, I think its pretty cheap to not have a light in the ash tray and that your passanger has to use a flashlight to see into the glove box at night (there is no light there either).  I buy a $70,000 truck and GM wants to save $35 on parts and labor!"
cadillac,escalade-esv,2005,jordanw, 07/14/2006,Platinum Edition,4,"We have had our Escalade ESV Platinum Edition for almost two years now.  Overall I have loved it.  It is powerful, safe, and comfortible.  The features of the Platinum Edition are top notch, but I do believe for the price point some features are missing such as adaptive cruise control, night vision, rain sensing wipers, massaging front seats, parking sensors in the front, and a heated third row.  All are availible on other Cadillacs why not the Platinum?  As for the cooled seats, what a great innovation!  However, the driver's seat one doesn't seem to work (I will have the dealer look at it soon) but in the backseats they work especially well it is almost like heaven.  I would buy another one (maybe the new 2007's)."

The kids love the extra room and the captains seats and my wife loves to drive it. It has so many options that we are still finding new options that we did not even know we had. It is worth the extra money to spend over the Chevy and the 6.0 liter engine runs great. This is by far the best SUV we have owned.

It is definitely great for family trips, its extremely comfortable.  It makes me feel safe when I drive on the freeway.  My husband definitely makes good use of it with his customers.

date!  I began with the introductory 
1999 model and then owned a 2003. The 
2005 Escalade ESV is by far Cadillac's 
finest accomplishment and I highly 
recommend it to anyone wanting a  
luxury ride, a large seating capacity,
and every option available -- with the 
exception of the chauffeur.  The touch 
screen radio -- including the XM radio -
- and Navigation system are two options 
that were not on my previous Escalades 
and I will never be without them 
again!  The ride in the ESV is 
comparable to riding on a cloud and the 
maneuverability in an SUV of this size 
is amazing!  You will not be

The only two things I would change is make the windshield taller (my Expedition had a bigger windshield) - it is hard to see when you have the visor down.  I wish Cadillac would have the keyless entry pad on the door like my Fords did.  This makes life much easier.  Other than that - I love it!

Its ton of room and comfort make this vehicle my favorite ride of all time! Think you have low tire pressure? Just push a button and check it from the inside of your car.  This is a great feature since I hate doing it manually. The Bose stereo system sounds as if you have surrond sound, and the touch screen programming is awesome."

I have to think they're not all legit.  It's very quiet, the ride is great, the interior and exterior are beautiful, it's solidly built, and it's very safe.  We were just rear-ended by an F150 and all we had was a scratch on the rear bumper the size of my thumb.  The F150 had $3,000+ damage.  We took a 3,500 mile road trip this summer from TX to the Rockies, and I assure you there is no finer road-trip machine. 17 mpg hwy.  We've had one minor problem, which was a seal on the transfer case (under $100), and it has been back to the dealer for repair ONCE since new.  This is 100% fact."
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Torque, 12/06/2006,Very Happy,4,After coming out of a '03 Navigator I believe Caddy stepped up to the plate. I test drove the '07 Naviagator and Expedition. The Escalade ESV is a superior vehicle. 103hp is considerable. The exterior styling is very well executed.

The perfomrance is fantastic and the fit and finish are top notch. I have the White Diamond with the Ebony interior. When comparing this truck to the European and Asian large SUV's the ESV wins on space and comfort.  Besides, the rumble of the V8 engine sounds like my '71 Vette.  The NAV system and the entertainment system are great along with the rear camera.  Air conditioned seats are a feature I thought I never needed and now wonder on those hot summer days how we did without.  Its gas mileage isnt to bad for its size.  Remember it weighs close to 3 tons so 14 mpg's ain't too shabby.  I have gotten over 17 on the highway. "

Bought new tires with only 30K on the original Bridgestones.
Lousy mileage around town, but she is built for the freeway. Love her on the open road.
Still not worth the price new they are asking.
So look for low mile used with a warranty.
And also an independent repair facility that can work with the warranty.
The dealers just dont get it, the quality of American autos are crap.

The dealership experience was top of the line. But we are having the black paint redone, interior detailed and some work completed under warranty. We have had the unit for 4 weeks and driven her 5 times. We are so spoiled by having 20 yrs of experience with Lexus, decided to try the ESV since it really looks so wonderful. Get past the looks, this isn't worth the 70K new and questionable if worth the $42K we spent. If I ever decide to be more positive about this experience, I will write you an update."

Interior is perfect and the cooled seats are great on hot summer days.  The only thing I don't like is the amount of real estate in the wheel wells with the optional 22"" rims.  Fuel economy is something of a moot point since with the AWD and 403 hp in such a heavy vehicle.  But then, if you're concerned about gas mileage, you probably can't afford this vehicle anyway.  This is definitely the finest vehicle I have ever owned.  If you have several kids and want the finest large SUV on the planet, this is it."

Don't get me wrong they are all fine cars in their own way but if you have 3 kids like we do and travel to the lake etc this is the best way to do it! After several Suburbans we tried a 2003 Cadillac Escalade ESV and my wife loved it. So much so that we put 100,000 miles on it in 3 years and never had a problem. As a matter of fact she wanted to keep it she loved it so much. Now we have the new style and the Best just got Better! Make you wife and kids happy guys get them one and they will love you for it.

First and foremost, why would you put the DVD player under the seat? You can't even stretch your legs without kicking it. The wireless headphones broke easily. The third row is pretty much for babies and toddlers only. The legroom is comical. Too much plastic too. Sometimes the DVD player won't turn off too. No fold flat seats or MP3 jack and the second row seats are really loud when you let them down. On the bright side, the performance is outstanding, the interior quality is great, and I love all of the features."

cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,bighuts4ever, 02/07/2009,good car to buy,5,i just bought a new esv and i love it its so good to drive and has good comfort the bad part in this car is the sound its so good but it works bose sound system if you are looking for a car this is the one that i highly say yes to :)
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Julie Bennett, 04/15/2009,Anyone like wind noise?,3,"I will start by saying I love the look of this SUV.  It looks sharp coming down the road.  Beautiful design.  But we have had nothing but trouble with this vehicle.  It has been in the shop more than I can count.  I usually wait until 3-4 things are wrong before I put it in the shop now.  The wind noise is unbelievable.  It is extremely loud on the highway on a windy day.  If you are wanting a quiet vehicle, this is not it.  We have never paid this much for a vehicle and have been nothing but disappointed.  Seems like the designers could have worked out all of the wind noise before they produced the car.  We are trading it in very soon and hoping for a quieter vehicle with less trouble."
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,wj waters, 06/10/2009,Best SUV made!!!!,5,"I bought this for my wife, we have 52,000 miles on it now and we have really enjoyed it. We had very little trouble wit this truck!!  I would buy another one in a heart beat!!!"
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Awesome ride, 02/07/2010,Awesome Ride!,4,"If this stinks for those who paid full boat for theirs, I apologize, but I just bought an 07 ESV Plat. edition, AWD for 36K w/50k miles. 36000! Can you say almost 2/3 off sticker? I can! For what I paid, this is the sweetest ride out there. I did not purchase this truck for the gas mileage, so we'll skip the I bought a vehicle that has 403 hp but I demand 40 mph decision. Wind noise at speed? The volume controls on your Bose surround sound system is on your steering wheel. Fantastic ride, fun to drive. All the Gizmos as our LTZ Avie had, but so much more of a luxury ride. And easier to see out of than the Avie. Can't wait for vacation time. See you on the open road."
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Scott, 09/16/2010,Good Big Highway Cruiser,3,"We bought this car to travel back and forth between WV Mts. and FL and it is perfect for that.  Lots of room as long as you remove the heavy 3rd row seats.  We have had no mechanical issues with 45k miles on it now.  I traded out for the 22 inch factory wheels and gave up some highway comfort for looks.  The 18"" factory tires soak up the road far better than the good looking 22"" factory wheels/tires. Great in the Mountains powerwise and with the transmission grade brake.  It is big and powerful enough to power through high snow drifts.  Pretty quiet on Highway, and you can drive with little effort as the long wheel base makes it very stable.  The computerized suspension works well."
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,MsAngel31, 02/22/2008,Big Mistake,4,"We bought the 2007 Escalade ESV as a step up from our Durango. We absolutely loved it. Starting the next day after signing, the problems started. Keyless remote start wouldn't work, then the heated seats quit, not once but 3 different times, the airconditioner wasn't working, the module for the tire pressure quit working, the heat in the back quit working and more. We have now owned this thing for 3 months and its been in the shop over 30 of those days on 9 different occassions. I would never ever buy another one!! 70K wasted....sigh"
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Mo, 06/05/2006,Awesome!,4,"I love it!  I went from an '03 ESV to the '07 and what a difference!  the new one has an awesome interior...it is very comfortable and everything is where it should be.  It rides nice and appears to handle much better than the '03.  A couple of additional items would have made this the perfect truck:  Bluetooth, Auto-up windows, and better fuel economy...early indications are about 10 MPG city / 14 MPG Highway...a far cry from the 13 City / 19 Hwy that are found in other reviews."
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,L. Danchik, 06/07/2006,Great Luxury in an American SUV,4,"I've had luxury cars and I've had SUV's. This one brings it all together in one package. It provides great styling and a great ride. Its interior is really classy. It has lots of luxury items throughout.  The navigation system and back-up rear camera are both really top notch. Mine is black and came with 22 inch chrome wheels. I have never had a car that gets so many ""looks"" running down the street. I know part of that is because it is so new, (and, after all, it IS a Cadillac), but the bold front grille and clean lines with just the right amount of chrome, really grabs attention. The engine has lots of power and acceleration, not like a big vehicle, at all. I can't wait to get in it going to or coming home from work.  "
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Vishal, 06/09/2006,2007 Excalade ESV,4,"The escalade ESV is a great family SUV. One problem is that there aren't that many interior options.  Also, the seats get dirty very easily. It takes regular unleaded fuel, so there are no worries about the high cost of Premium.  My truck gets 12 mpg city, and 17 mpg highway."
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Yadvinder, 06/11/2006,Amazing SUV,4,"This is an amazing SUV. They have improved the engine, it now has 403hp. It has a spacious trunk compared to the regular Escalade. It drives great, it's not that fun to drive around due to its size but it's really great on trips."

The ESV is the SUV bar none!"
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Myke, 05/29/2007,Wow!,5,This SUV is way beyond what I had expected. It has dramatically changed from the previous model. Everything is better more dramatic in design. No one can mistake this SUV for any other.
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,DANIEL PECKHAM, 05/28/2007,CADILLAC ESV,4,"Over all we love this vehicle, however we are very unhappy with the wind noise and have had it into the dealership 4 times to try and have it corrected. The dealership has done everything the manufacturer has recommended and there has not been much improvement it sounds like the windows are not all the way up and is very annoying as we did not plan on spending money and have this problem.  Love the seats with the A/C as we live in Florida. Drives beautifully."
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Anthony K, 05/24/2007,Cadillac Did It Right!,4,"I enjoy every aspect of my big, bold and beautiful ESV!  It is very comfortable for my legs at 6'6"". I love the strong growl of the engine, it's like a muscle car on steroids. I guess it's an SUV with an asterisk. I was very careful before spending over $60K for a vehicle. I did the comparisons with all the other leading luxury SUVs - none compared in features and power (403 horsepower!) This SUV is the King! I bought this car becauase I liked everything about it. I never thought I would so many looks and compliments and 'thumbs ups' in traffic. This SUV turns heads!  I have no idea how sane person could give this SUV a bad rating. Go drive it for yourself...   "

For a company that brags about ""the quietest ride ever"", it is loudest vechicle I have ever been in.  The wind noise is so bad that I am thinking of trading it in already.  I have had it into the dealer 5 times with to no avail.  It sounds like the windows are rolled down and the wind is blowing 90 mph.  I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this ESV until some MAJOR changes happen.  "
cadillac,escalade-esv,2007,Kerrie, 07/13/2016,Piece of CRAP!,1,"I bought this car with only 20K miles on it.  It has been NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS!  I am a mom of three children. THE only thing good about this car is it can fit all of my children in it and their friends!  Other than that, its awful and always being repaired at a certified Cadillac dealership.  I have a filing cabinet knee deep with repair bills. I finally had the car paid off last year, the car had 87k miles and the engine blew.  I had no choice but to put a new engine in it or the car would of been a complete loss. The radio has gone out THREE times. The radio installed is $1,300  I'm sorry but a radio being replaced three times is absolutely ridiculous. I will not be purchasing another Cadillac. I'm sorry but for the amount we paid for this vehicle, its not worth it. I'm so disappointed in Cadillac and hope no one ever has to go through what I have.

We had several ""Euro-lux"" cars prior; this Escalade is an exceptional vehicle in all respects. Assumed, based on stereotypes, that the car was going to be an ""American Slug"" but needed the space & reluctantly went with it. Not so! It's been perhaps the best vehicle I've ever owned. Have driven cross- country, urban, & suburban settings for over two years. It's been utterly reliable, & the routine service provided by the dealer has been stellar. And this record of excellence has occurred in one of the USA's harshest climates; over 45,000 miles so far. Believe me, this vehicle has proven it's worth!"

Every time, I went to the dealership to fix this issue and the last time I had gone, they ""fixed"" it. On the drive home, there were severe issues and we ended up driving back to the dealership within 35 minutes of receiving it because the issues had not been resolved. When we returned, they fixed this issue. However, when we expressed our frustration that we had experienced several transmission issues with the car, specifically during long trips (at 25, 000 miles) , the dealership simply shrugged and said "" all cars have issues."""

Love the vehicle overall, dealership experience at Naperville Cadillac not so good. Strange that there is no supplement to the owners manual for Platinum features, like mag. ride control, heated/cooled cup holders, and seat back video systems.  Some fit and finish under par (creased alum. dash trims, sloppy body panel fits). Heated/cooled cup holders malfunctioned immediately.  Warranty service?  We've been waiting a month with no parts still.  Audio/video system is great - 5 TV's!  Kids love it. Cooled seats work much better in my STS than in this vehicle.  White carpet and lower door panels?  Who at GM had that idea?  Smooth power!"

When I mentioned about Audi, she did not even talk to me at all. I traded in my Porche 911 Turbo with no regret. Driven over 1000 miles so far,and we are extremely satisfied. Gorgeous exterior styling, very comfy and roomy interior, and great ride. Backup camera works really good even at very dark night, and touch screen NAV system is very easy to use. Good gas mileage for this big and heavy SUV. This is the best SUV."

cadillac,escalade-esv,2009,Sean, 04/12/2010,Waste of money,3,"I will be truly honest with you, the car is a piece of crap. The interior should be entirely redone. Let me start with the rear air vents after just 3 months, one was twisted and just fell off. Look at the glove compartment, you can't even fit the owners manual in their. The center console is wobbly and it's a struggle getting some things in and out because of the rough edges. Plus, there is no auto close for the rear window and the tailgate makes a loud ding and is very loud when you open/close it. Also, the interior parts such as the rubber door lining is practically thrown together and each part in the interior seems uneven with the other parts. Don't waste your money and get a German car."

Noise that I thought was wind noise was tire noise. If you go on long trips, you give up some bling but turn the ride back to a Caddy ride.

It's embarrassing after paying $80K for a 2010 Escalade Plat to have a w/shield wiper chatter prob. rt out of box. After 4 dealer attempts & conversations with GM Tech Center engrs can't fix and gave up. Wiper chatter happens only during rain & not while using washer fluid. I developed a test to simulate rain with garden hose gently sprinkling because the local dealer service could not duplicate.

cadillac,escalade-esv,2016,Griselda C. Gaytan, 03/22/2017,Transmission shifting is still not great.,3,"My husband and I have purchased brand new GM vehicles for many years now. Needles to say we have invested a great deal of money in our trucks and suvs. In 2015 we decided to purchase a 2016 Cadillac ESV because we liked the look of it. Well, not everything that glitters is gold, that's for sure!! Shortly after purchasing we started noticing the shifting was rough, the gears shift so rough all the passengers feel the rough shifting especially when taking off and on and off during a ride. The roughness of the shifting gets worse after time. As the problem with the shifting gets worse and worse the truck eventually won't even turn on, it just goes dead. We had to use cables to start it up so we could drive it to the agency and hope it would not leave us stranded. We expected so much more from a Cadillac vehicle being that our investment was a total of 94,000 dollars. The truck has been in the shop a total of six (6) times and it almost feels as if I've been driving a loaner more than my vehicle. Our family loves to take road trips in the summer months but we we have not been able to take summer road trips since we do not trust this truck to keep our family safe. We have no faith in Cadillac products and will never, EVER invest in Cadillac again!! We contacted GM to informed them of our concerns and expected GM to stand by their product but the best they could do was inform us that the shifting pattern is a new one with these new Cadillacs and the customers are not used to it. Whaaat??? No vehicle that we have ever driven shifts as rough and in such unpredictable patterns as this Cadillac ESV. Plus every time we get our vehicle back and new parts such as , gear box, are replaced and computer is reprogrammed it rides much better but eventually the problem starts once again until it gets so bad it eventually goes dead again!
 We will be trading this useless piece of JUNK for a real quality suv. Obviously GM does not care enough about their customers to keep them satisfied. Never Again!!

It's been a while since my first review and a lot has changed. 
After filing the lemon law documents through the BBB and getting our lawyer involved GMC offered to exchange our vehicle for any other vehicle we wanted.
We paid a fee of approximately 10,000 dollars which in the lemon law is called a usage fee. The usage fee is basically what you have to pay for the time the vehicle was used based on a formula.
We chose another Cadillac Escalade ESV.
it was great at first but now just two months and a half driving the vehicle we are starting to notice the modulator acting up. We will be calling the agency to get it serviced.  This truck is much, much better. We are hoping it just needs adjustment.
The interior assembly of this new 2017 model seems to be much sturdier since I don't hear rattling of panels like with the last one.  It's too soon to tell though.
If you are thinking of spending high dollar on a luxury vehicle I don't recommend it. Try Lexus or Range Rover.

I went to different dealerships from january 2016 till now(october 216) but no one able to find that noise exactly where its coming from instead they started changing all the parts out of my brand new escalade.

cadillac,escalade-esv,2016,Jim Hilbrant, 01/12/2016,"Cost vs quality, fitment=big disappointment,",1,"UPDATED 21 Aug 19:  Nothing changed DO NOT BUY!!!~Having owned the 2007 ESV I thought long and hard about buying a new 2016.  Keeping in context we have owned Lexus since 1990, total of five LS models over the years. Best single auto manufacturer in the world for quality, value, cost of ownership.  Unless you need the size of the ESV for family, road travel, don't buy one.  Your hard earned $80K+ needs to go elsewhere because of the workmanship, quality issues.  It LOOKS awesome, rides great, it is the fitment, vibration, flutter of plastic parts rubbing against each other that will drive you crazy. The center CUE had a vibration as if a wiring harness had been flopping around. The sunroof decided just this morning that something up in there, needed to be jostling around, and these things happen only when they want to.  We have only owned her 3 weeks, she has 735 miles on her.  We got her for the room, size to accommodate family.  If LEXUS ever decides to make one similar in size, we are in.
Nothing in my review changes except that I will never own another.  It is GM junk at the highest level.  Last May 22, 2016 we finally got help from the BBB in Washington DC to help replace the original 2016 we bought in Dec. 2015.  It took us 6 months to get rid of that pile of junk, replaced it with another pile of junk.  Folks other than the dealer experience being so stealor and supportive, I will never own another.  PERIOD.  From problems with transmissionn shifting at times I cant understand, to the dye color of the leather already wearing away.  Plastic parts look like wood and yet vibrate into a frenzy at times.  Listen carefully, you do what you want.  If you want to toss money into a pit loaded with stress and problems, then buy this thing.  If you want to save yourself the grief, buy Lexus or something else.   UPDATE:  JUNK it is OVERPRICED JUNK   Would love to sell it if you know of anyone interested.  DO NOT BUY ANYTHING CADILLAC

The repair shop stated there is nothing further they can do and that the vibration is common in the 2016 8 speed transmission GM products.

The first time I took the car in and showed them the technical service bulletins they started working on the transmission.

cadillac,escalade-esv,2016,Adam S, 05/13/2019,GM reliability destroying once great Escalade,2,"Bought a certified 2016 Escalade ESV because we just had our 3rd kid and needed something with extra room for 3 car seats and 2 strollers. 
Traded in my 2013 Infiniti JX35 with 90k trouble free miles. Loved that SUV, but too small for my needs. 
Day 1 of owning Escalade heard tranny slipping and truck bangs and thumps with every shift. Dealer replaced tranny fluid and that made a huge difference. 
Took back possession of vehicle and right away, heard an engine ticking. Took it back and needed a new belt. 
Now when I put truck into AUTO from 2WD in rain and snow it sounds like the front differential(?) is slipping. Truck sounds rough, feels like crap and I’m trying to get another appointment with the dealer. 
These trucks looks gorgeous, don’t get me wrong and I love the Kona leather interior with the Captains seats. It’s comfortable and fast, but the reliability is so bad that after 3 months I can comfortably say I won’t buy Cadillac again. Also the dealer experience has been less than stellar, but I realize that depends on individual dealerships. 
I wish Lexus or Infiniti would build an XL Luxury SUV. With as many Escalades and Suburbans on the road, I have to assume there’s a solid business case. 
In either case, check out the Navigator or Expedition, because GM has self destructed with their horrendous reliability. But if you must get GM, please get an extended warranty.  Cadillac certified warranty is crap.  My Fidelity warranty has covered more than $3,700 worth of fixes that Cadillac wouldn’t cover.

cadillac,escalade-esv,2016,bbtx1987, 10/18/2019,"Stay Away, Transmission complete garbage",1,"We bought our 2016 Escalade ESV new 3.5 years ago and have been PLAGUED with issues. Drove it off the lot and brought it back within 3 weeks complaining of rough transmission shifting at low speeds, steering wheel vibrations and a whining noise at high speeds. Car always 'within spec' so nothing the dealer could do. If we would of just returned the dang thing. Since then, we've had the car in over 12 times complaining about the transmission alone. I've also had to have the rear HVAC controls replaced twice for controls not responding and rear seat warmers turning on by themselves, drivers seat replaced for failing controls, steering week column replaced, rear lift gate motor replaced as it died, the battery died and stranded me, rear shocks leaking and replaced at 33k miles, wood paneling replaced from bending out of place, lane assist recalibrated.... And the kicker... all those times I complained about the transmission, I had GUNK in the transmission fluid at 33k miles - that needed replaced. Now we are ditching this hunk of junk for something more reliable given we believe the transmission is faulty and irreversibly damage given we've been complaining since we drove the car off the lot. 
DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY, we are pissed at the quality of this crap GM product with how much we spent. We filed a complaint with GM and they just wanted to 'assist us with getting it fixed with the dealer.' Thanks, but no thanks. I can schedule taking my car into the dealer for the 20+ time on my own, as I have for the entire 3.5 years we've owned the thing. Worst car I've ever owned - never had this many issues on my other cars combined!"
cadillac,escalade-esv,2016,James, 01/13/2019,love it but confused,3,"Before buying the Escalade take it out for a test drive for a day or two! We traded in our 2018 Traverse and bought our 2016 Escalade used. We thought we needed something bigger because we have four girls and one of them is one and a half year old. Needed luggage room so we purchased it.  A week later we heard a ticking sound in the engine so we went back to the dealer and they told us that it was normal and they went ahead  and change the oil and we didn't hear it anymore. The next morning my wife called me on her way to work and she that said she hears the ticking noise again and I told her well just keep driving it will probably go away. The next day the ticking noise gotten louder to a clunking noise. We took it back to the dealership then they told us  that we needed a new engine and it's covered under warranty. We were shocked because the vehicle had ouly 38,000 miles on it. They went ahead and fixed it and replace the engine and they also went ahead  and fix the recall that it had. Drove it for a couple weeks and had more power than it had before and then transmission started slipping it seems like. Brought it back they said that it's normal the computer is probably trying to interact with the new engine. We took it again for the 2nd time for the transmission and  they cannot find anything. Sometime it will jump back or skip! To make a long story start I went ahead and bought a Mercedes GLC for my wife so she can go to work with and yes we still have the Escalade but it's sits because I travel for work so it really doesn't drive that often unless I'm home. That was the biggest investment we ever made in our life and we are trying to figure out what to do with it. Its is a beautiful truck don't get me wrong  that's why I am so upset  it's a shame!! 😠Cadillac need to get their stuff together and treat their customers right and build a good quality vehicle.

It was used w/less than 20k miles on it and still has less than 30k miles. Within the short time frame we've owned it, the info/CUE screen/system blanked out several times, had to take in twice and seems to be fixed now but? When it goes out, of course so does your air. More importantly however the brake pads (on the front end) are defective. Not just worn/general use issues, but pretty much disintegrating and need to be replaced. Since this is considered a 'maintenance' issue, it is not covered under warranty. So a 2 year old vehicle w/less than 30k miles and paying for new brake pads OOP. Other issues like shifting when taking off or stepping on it to get going after slowing down are regular occurrences. The ride itself is noticeably better than the 2017 Tahoe we had before and so far the rest of the bells and whistles are functioning nicely. Just wish Cadillac would stand by it's product better.

The one that replaced the first lemon, the second is still a lemon pile of junk.  At just over 40K in miles highway at that, the transmission gave up the ghost.  In shop now to replace and guess what the 2019 loaner is the same pile.  You can hear the transmission starting to whine at 2800 miles.

cadillac,escalade-esv,2017,Tammy, 06/19/2018,"Won't start, just click, click, click, click",1,"This is a 2017 Cadillac Escalade ESV buyback. We knew they put a new motor in it. We bought it 14 hours away from home. Then stopped 9 hours away from home for dinner. It would not start back up just click, click , click. Had it towed to the nearest Cadillac dealer, stayed in a hotel, got a rental . Called Cadillac customer service and since we had AAA tow it they refused to help me with anything. ( Hello, I JUST purchased the vehicle a few hours previous.) Went back over to the dealership in the morning with the rental after getting uber to take us to the nearest rental place open on a sunday hoping it would start and it did. Took the rental back, drove straight home did not shut it off at all. Once home we shut it off , then tried to start it again and it would not start just click, click, click. Had it towed to a dealership near us. It would not, not start for them (4 days). I went up and got it. I had e-mailed Cadillac Customer service 3 times by now with no response. I called Cadillac customer service got a case# and was told to e-mail my receipts of being stranded in Toledo Ohio, so I put the receipts in the next e-mail for reimbursement.   Afraid to shut it off wherever we went,  two weeks later it acted up again. no start, just click, click, click. My guys bumped the bottom of the starter and it started so WE knew it was the starter and the dealership confirmed that 20 miles after the motor was put in they put in a starter ( not told to us when we bought the vehicle) . Back up to the dealership it went. For a week this time. I e-mailed Cadillac customer service again asking for the status of my case# and to advise them the vehicle would still not start intermittently . Still no response from Cadillac customer service.  Still it would not, not start for them. I went back up to pick it up. Now today June 19 2018 exactly a month from the day we bought it . It will not start just  click click, click. I know if we put it on the tow truck to go back it will jostle the starter and it will start again for them. I called the dealership and they can not send someone to my house. So, I am again stuck with a vehicle I do not dare drive anywhere without leaving it running. Cadillac Customer Service is a Joke. I have a case# and yet still nothing has been done. I have e-mailed them 5 times called 9 times and the only contact I have had from them is from me making the effort to contact them. I have received 1 phone call from them on June 16th(Saturday I was with my children and do not answer my phone) and it was on my voice mail that if I did not contact them by June 18th they were closing the case.    I called them and got NO ONE, only a voice mail and I left a message. Still no call back. So I called another # this morning and they transferred me to the same ""Senior Rep"" for me to leave another voice mail. I received a call on my cell phone which I had told them only to use after 5pm. She ""Sheila"" the senior customer rep stated they denied my reimbursement and told me to have the dealership near me reimburse me. Then they possibly would reimburse the dealership. WHAT it is not the dealership I am taking it to to be fixed fault that the vehicle stranded me 9 hours from home 5 hours after I bought it . I told her it is not the money, I have the money to cover the hotel, uber, rental,  it is the principal that Cadillac is suppose to be the ELITE of customer service !!   I asked to have her supr call me. She said it will be 1-2 business days. Then preceeded to tell me that they consider business days as 8 hours a day and it would be before 48 ""business"" hours that I would receive a call.    So, maybe 5-6 days before I get a call and in the meantime I am stuck with a Cadillac I can not depend on !!!!!  BEYOND FRUSTRATED !!!!!

cadillac,escalade-esv,2018,Cindy W., 01/28/2020,My dream vehicle!,5,"If you're looking for a great ride, a ton of bells and whistles and a stylish vehicle, you're going to love owning an Escalade.  This SUV has everything, hiding spots for your belongings, USB ports everywhere, 120v plugin, a ton of Bose speakers and so much more.  

The camera system is amazing! When I flip up my rear view mirror I see traffic behind me.  When I pull into my garage I still get the 360 view to make sure that I'm over enough and in far enough.

My only issue, and this is a me issue is that this is sooo much bigger than the Tahoe I came from.  This one is a beast ;o) so I'm having problems pulling into parking spots still, but with time, I'm sure that I'll nail it.

cadillac,escalade-esv,2019,Fred Flickster, 12/23/2018,Traded '18 Escalade ESV Premium for '19 Platinum,5,"This is by far the best at what it does.  It goes country club to cross country vacation hauling with luxurious power and comfort. Haul the family, dogs, luggage and boat to the coast. Doesn't breath hard, smooth as silk, pulls like there's nothing attached & passes like a muscle SUV. All weather, in all seasons with comfort  and confidence. I've driven everything in the $75K to $125K, over 6000lb GVW category luxury SUV category for Section 179 business purposes... they're all nice and each has their niche. However, they (like any vehicle) have their drawbacks. For example, take the 2018 Mercedes 450 GLS. The front seat ride and comfort is super, however the back seats are not designed for any drives other than a straight line. Avoid riding in the back with a full stomach. Range Rover is too small. XC90 is a front wheel drive SUV? X5. Q90, etc... are great as well, but again, not the  SUV of choice.  For family, toys, horse trailers, boats, etc... and all the gear that goes with them, the 2019 Escalade ESV Platinum can't be beat. Drive train choices are 2wheel, AWD, 4High and 4Low, paired with a heavy duty 10spd Automatic. Plus Touring, Sport and Snow modes at the touch of a button... it's the standard by which all others are judged.

cadillac,xt4,2019,PeterC, 03/22/2019,"XT4 Tech/Comfort, Fun-to-Drive, Performant SUV",5,"Well thought out SUV. Just traveled 250 highway miles at 70 mph and averaged 29.2 miles per gallon - incredible! My 6 cylinder, 2015 top-rated SUV never got more than 22 mpg on the highway. The advanced adaptive cruise control is truly set and forget. Will even stop the car.  This feature alone significantly reduces driver fatigue. Made the 250 mile highway drive a breeze. XT4 is well laid out - smart combination of buttons and touchscreen makes it easy to operate - no fumbling for climate controls, heated seats, or switching audio tracks. Very convenient volume control knob ensures you play all your music at the perfect level. (Or you can use the up/down volume control buttons on the steering wheel if you prefer.) Advanced technology makes the XT4 a pleasure to drive. The other day a neighbor was walking his dog as I was rounding a corner. The person icon in the heads-up display turned yellow and the SUV automatically slowed. XT4 will anticipate things before you do. XT4 is an interesting SUV that combines technology and comfort for a fun-to-drive, performant SUV.  Note: A few of the reviews I've read have said that the engine is noisy.  I'm don't agree with those reviews.  The interior is very quite and don't notice any excessive engine noise.  I've driven the car over 1,100 miles and much prefer it to the Acura RDX (previously owned) and Infinity Q30 (rented on trip before getting Cadillac and is not as comfortable).  Bottom line is that the XT4 performs well (strong engine, quick/smooth shifts), is very comfortable (great seat positioning/support), great layout of controls (and very responsive touch screen) and is really fun to drive.

Replaced a 2016 SRX that we really liked, but like this more.  It's sporty looking, has great acceleration and quiet comfortable drive.  Excellent interior finishes with controls that make sense and are easy to understand and use.  Vastly improved entertainment system is a pleasure to use vs. old CUE systems.  Plenty of room front or back for my 6'3"" frame.  Add to all this the fact it runs on regular gasoline vs. any competition and this is a vehicle to take seriously over it's competition.

cadillac,xt4,2019,Bruce W., 04/14/2019,Nicely thought out and comfortable compact SUV,4,"I traded a MB 300E Sport for this- which was just 'too low' for me to be comfortable in. The tech is 'on par' with the Benz- and it is quieter except for hard acceleration. Ride is firm- but not much different then the MB's Sport suspension. Handles well. It has a 'full size spare tire' - so no worry about getting stranded and the expense of replacing a 'run flat tire'. Seats are very  comfortable and wide with adjustable lumbar and heat and massage- and rear leg room is 'unmatched' by anything else in this class. Like the Benz it has 'control buttons' for those who prefer them - and CUE system is much improved and faster then previous system- and uses a  'touch screen' that Benz lacked.  I think Cadillac is on 'right track' with what the XT4 has to offer!

cadillac,xt4,2019,Patti M, 02/10/2019,Great Car If Sensors Worked As Expected,3,"I leased a Premium Luxury XT4 after driving a Lexus for the past 12 years.  Unfortunately my car died on me at 300 miles with a Service Transmission message.  The dealer was good about getting me a loaner car out that same night.  It turned out to be the sensor and they found that many of the wires had been pinched and/or misrouted.  I had been experiencing the parking sensors and the cameras coming on at random times.  While they corrected the wiring which fixed the transmission issue, the parking sensors continue to come on at random times.  The dealership even took out a new car and was able to duplicate the same problem.  Supposedly the dealership is working with Cadillac to see if the problem can be resolved with a software update.  Not only do the front parking sensors come on at random times, the pedistrian sensor also comes on randomly - like on a major freeway where I'm sure there pedistrians are not walking.  My phone also continues to unsync and I have to delete everything to get it to pair again.  This means I often do not have a phone that will work with my car.  My gas milage has been around 22 in the city and 29 when I did a road trip.  I am now at 1200 miles and while there are things I like about my car, I could not recommend it to anyone else until they manage to get all of the bugs worked out of the sensors.  I have an expectation that everything should work as expected when paying this much for a new car.

Very comfortable and by far the best tech a car has to offer as far as entertainment, navigation, etc is concerned (GM has pretty much one of the the best User Interfaces out there).  I'm glad that Cadillac got rid of the capacitive touch Cue system, that thing was horrendous and never does what you want it to do.  We've only had one problem with it.

I just had it out in about 6 to 8 inches of snow, Ice, on some mild inclines and it did great.  I haven't put cable chains on, and just factory tires, but I was very impressed.  Usually, its at my mountain cabin where we deal with the snow, but this week the Seattle area is getting a lot, and on Bainbridge, where I live there is snow, ice, and hills (and a limitted amount of road sanding).  I have to say it totally exceeded my expectations.  I have only had the car about a week, but I am loving it.  The interior fits me well (at 6'-2"") and I can even sit it the back without being squeezed, and have good leg room.  The voice controls, and the smart phone interconnect work well. I like the interior trim and design, climate controls are simple to understand.  Overall a very nice looking and performing compact suv (that doesn't feel too compact on the inside).  And for those of you in the Seattle area, Doug's Cadillac was truly a pleasure to work with I highly recommend.

cadillac,xt4,2019,Elliot Klinbovsky, 08/18/2019,Caddy XT4,5,"Leased my XT4 in April. My last vehicle was a leased Lexus IS350 F-Sport which I loved. Just too little room inside. I was hesitant about going back to American made cars because of old reputations for poor reliability and quality. So far, I am extremely happy I did go back. The good...First, the XT4’s seats are incredibly comfortable, probably the most comfortable out of all the cars I have purchased over the years. The vehicle has over 9000 miles now, is squeak and rattle free, and I am loving it more everyday. I ordered a white sport AWD with upgraded 20 inch wheels which look amazing. These wheel are a little stiffer driving than the standard 18’s. The optional Bose 13 speaker audio system is well worth the upgrade price. It sounds better and clearer than its competitor’s much more expensive upgrades. Tech and GPS is top notch, easy to learn, and with nice looking graphics. One of the things I love the most is the interior quality and look. The carbon fiber (not sure if it is real) across the dashboard on the sport looks awesome.
The bad...I believe this vehicle could benefit from 20-30 more horsepower standard. While it is no slouch, a vehicle in this price range and class should be quicker. Also, the price. Starting out in the mid 30’s, it’s reasonable. Upgrade it as most will, it will reach as did mine close to 50 grand or more.  That’s steep in this category. And last, the vehicle has a weird swaying feeling when hitting bumps whether tracking straight, or in a turn. Not sure if that is a characteristic of this vehicle, or it’s suspension. All in all, love my new Caddy XT4!

I have addressed this issue approximately 10 different times with Cadillac service and have contacted Cadillac directly, they do not seem to think there is a problem.

cadillac,xt4,2019,BDP, 12/17/2018,Perfect Ride for the Pacific Northwest,5,"Traded an ATS for the XT4 to get a little more cargo volume, but with the same footprint.  The powertrain is state-of-the-art with a BAS stop-start, cylinder-shut-off, turbo, DOHC, direct injection, 9-speed transmission and in my case, AWD.  Interstate driving at 70 mph gives a repeatable 30 mpg, wind and tire noise are very low in the cabin, the XT4 is not pushed around by the grooves from studded tires in the highway, and AWD is perfect for drives in the Cascades.

Mine was $48,500 and does not have heads up display or adaptive cruise control or navigation.  But my main complaint is engine noise at accelleratiin and a hum at 40 and 60 mph.  It is a little too torquey and less of a luxury ride.  It falls in the odd zone of trying to be sporty and luxury but missed on each one.   The really only great feature is it fits into my garage easily.  Not comfortable for long road trips.  I will probably trade for Genesis GV80 or Jeep Wagoneer when they come out.

cadillac,xt4,2019,dave stone, 12/14/2018,rough engine noise at start,3,"drive great. But what is going to be the most talked about with the XT4 is how noisy and rough the engine is the first 10-15 second when you first take off. Sounds like it's always asking for upshift. reminds me of my old chevy engine. This will have to be the first item to adress with the refresh.

cadillac,xt4,2019,Fred, 01/02/2019,From an ATS to an XT4,5,"After four years of driving my ATS with 6 cylinder 321 HP I leased an XT4.   Pros:  Fantastic technology, great visibility, very easy to get in/out, softer more comfortable ride, quiet, one set of golf clubs fits sideways just like ATS but not quite as wide.  My large bag and standard driver ""just"" fit.  Take you clubs and try before you buy.  184"" length to still fits into garage the same way.  Seats are more comfortable than ATS and can be adjusted so your head isn't hitting the head/neck protector.  Also, seats heat up and massage your lower back!    Cons:  Certainly doesn't handle like the ATS in terms of acceleration, cornering but more comfy ride.  Accelerated plenty fast enough to get you up to speed on the freeway no problem at all.  All in all I'm really liking the change.

In which the service manager stated the part does not exist !! What? how can you make a care and not have replacement parts? They gave me my car back and stated it was safe to drive as I was driving the car down shifted from 40 to 30 MPH. I took the car back same day they mentioned OH yeah your timing belt is off not working I was told by service writer the car should have never been sold. 4 months later still no car no resolution to the turbo , engine, timing thing frustrated !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

cadillac,xt4,2019,Kenny Solov, 02/25/2019,First Caddy ..... and I like it !,4,"A bit a apprehensive to purchase my first Cadillac, in fact my first GM product. Like many of my generation growing up in the 80’s we were told, and experienced superior reliability from the likes of Honda and Toyota. And we dreamed of stepping up to Lexus and Accra when we had made it. So I drank the koolaid, owned them all with a few German marks thrown in as well. I was bored stiff. My XT4 has attitude that the Japanese could only dream of. The exterior shouts individual here. The interior is plusher and in my opinion more soothing and refreshing. Now I know some folks want to keep their boy racer fantasies alive, but know what ? I grew up and so did Caddy."

My vehicle has had the transmission replaced one and I have been having ongoing problems with the tranny to this day Cadillac refuses to admit there is still a problem car is less than a year old and it's embarrassing to drive with anyone who asks what's wrong with this car .

There isn’t a bad view of this vehicle.  It is the right size for my lifestyle needs.  Is it sports car fast, no.  However, it is light on its feet and is plenty fast.

cadillac,xt4,2019,Cadillac owner, 06/15/2020,1 year review of this underrated car,5,"So we got this car 1 year ago and I must say this car is very underrated compared to German and Japanese luxury vehicles. The interior is very nice to sit in for the driver and passenger and feels like a luxury car. The infotainment screen is well organized and is very responsive and the camera quality is crystal-clear. The outside looks are very sleek and something that if you had an XT4 you would easily recognize it in the parking lot. Also the XT4 drives very well and the engine sounds powerful and has amazing performance. 

Cons:
The backseats don't recline and feel to comfortable but is not a deal breaker.
The transmission does not have smooth transitions between gears at certain speeds.
When accelerating it takes the turbo charge a second to activate.

All in all the XT4 is still a car that should be on your radar if you are looking for a luxury SUV.

cadillac,xt4,2019,Cadillac Lady, 07/13/2020,I LOVED my ATS Coupe and LOVE the XT4,5,"My lease was up on the ATS Coupe. I had 3 ATS's in a row and LOVED the sportiness and handling of them; they are a ""driver's car"".  Because the new CT4 and CT5 sedans were not out yet and Cadillac no longer made the ATS I had a decision to make. The XT4 has the 2.0T engine, which I loved, but didn't have that heavy feeling larger SUV's have. The interior space is generous and huge rear leg room in the XT4 compared to the ATS. Many safety features now standard on the XT4 Premium Luxury.  Definitely more  cargo space; a great vehicle for two to travel in.

Is the engine abit loud while standing outside the vehicle? Yes. But once inside the Active Noise cancellation and quiet cabin really put all the alleged loud engine noise concerns to bed.

The Luxury has a sun roof and a lot of safety features but I felt the base model came with SO MUCH that it was perfect, and it is.  Great fuel economy ( Don't love the  stop feature when you are at a stoplight but it's becoming a lot more common, I get it)   Living in Florida, A/C is important and this system delivers in spades.  Love hat we can remotely start the car and cool it off first.  Sound system is insane!  Inclusion of apple car play is seemless.

cadillac,xt5,2017,John, 12/08/2016,Thoughts from an SRX driver,5,"I took my SRX in for warranty work and was given the XT5 AWD as a loaner for one day.  Here is my thoughts based on the 55 miles I put on it. The XT5 is similar to my 4-month-old SRX in terms of pricing and trim level. However, the XT5 is very different in the following ways. Engine: newer engine with auto-start-stop function and a newer transmission.  Secondly, I noticed right away that the led lights are standard and the headlights are not halogen like the similar trim SRX. The XT5 does have the auto start/stop where the engine could be automatically turned off at a red light (by the software). When you step on the gas pedal, the engines turns back on. The car, also, switches between V6 and V4 mode depending on the power needs, similar to Honda's VCM technology. The ride is quiet, smooth, and sure-footed. However, I did feel that the SRX's engine delivers quick power when demanded while the XT5's engine has to figure out how much power the driver needs before delivering it.  So there is a brief lag time since the software has to decide between different modes (V6 vs V4) to deliver power. On the positive note, the XT5 is very fuel efficient compared to the SRX. The nagging windspeed noise originating from the panoramic roof on the SRX seems to have been resolved. The placement of several buttons on the SRX, such as parking brake or Onstar, have been moved around. So there will be a learning curve for the SRX drivers when they upgrade to the XT5. Most importantly, several ""digital"" buttons on the SRX's CUE (ex. such as heated seat button) have been replaced with actual buttons on the newer model. The CUE seems to be more responsive on this upgraded model but there is still a decent amount of time needed to learn it if you are not familiar with the system. The most important difference is the new, redesigned seats.  They are more comfortable than the SRX's seats. My XT5 did come with collision warning, cross traffic alerts, and the seats do have a vibrate function to alert the driver of imminent dangers on the road. Finally, XT5 has a bigger interior and seems less heavy while driving when compared to the SRX. Overall, it is a decent improvement over the SRX. In other notes: if you have a larger family or require more space than the XT5 but cannot afford to break the bank trying to purchase an Escalade, my recommendation is to hold off till the XT7 comes out in 2018-19 timeframe.

cadillac,xt5,2017,L. Fleury, 06/18/2016,After Much Research - Love my XT5,5,"I was on the hunt for a crossover/SUV that could serve as my work commute car (about 15 miles) with some business meetings an hour or two away while also serving as a family vehicle for travel in New England (and therefore purchased the AWD model).  I love that the vehicle is a V6 with ""cylinder reduction""; only using all six when needed.  The AWD feature is controlled by a button and can be engaged while driving -- therefore, I do not need to use it in dry/warm conditions.  The interior is beyond gorgeous and comfortable.  Handling is seamless and sporty.  Love, love, the vehicle - so far, so good!  The XT5 is made in Spring Hill, TN - another selling point for me as I was looking for an American car.  Last, but certainly not least, the car takes ""regular"" grade gas.  A huge selling point for me.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Disappointed Owner, 08/15/2017,Beautiful Peice of Crap!,2,"I've owned my 2017 Platinum XT5 for about 14 months. The Cadillac Service Department has had it on and off for about 2 of those months. (They have it now as I type this memo) Its currently going on 3 weeks for this visit to the shop. The vehicle has had a host of reoccurring issues from: video from backup camera flickers when in reverse; service rear camera popups in Cue system; service front proximity sensor popup messages; issues with climate controls from the center stack as well as the rear console; folding mirrors sometimes don't respond when you touch the button; auto shutoff when the vehicle is stopped quit working. The Service Department has addressed these issues but some reoccur.  Its been serviced by Cadillac least 7-9 times in these 14 months. The Service manager says he is talking to GM about my issues.

cadillac,xt5,2017,rick, 07/14/2016,Great ride,5,"When someone starts gives you how big a seat is in inches, I kind of figure they're a competitor and not an owner. I've owned more than a few SUV's in my including the RX (3), Audi (1), a Highlander, an Infiniti and1 other American SUV besides a Caddy. Had a SRX which quite frankly I didn't care for. I now own an XT5 and it is a great car. Transmission is 8 speed so it's moving through gears nicely. Blue tooth hookup and what I like is if the phone rings, the A/C gets quieter automatically. I like that there are now more buttons and less of that touch screen. I hated pushing the screen to increase the A/C. Now it's a button. The rear view camera can be used as your rear view mirror so if there are people in the back seat, your view will not be blocked. I'm 6 foot but not overweight so I find the seats very comfortable. My legs haven't fallen asleep while driving. All in all, I'm happy with this SUV and I believe it compares favorably with the RX.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Don J, 07/17/2016,The Right Choice,5,"Test Drive the Lexus GX 460 & BMW X3 SUV and the decision will be easy. The XT5 checks all of the Boxes. Make sure you get the full wrap warranty protection, It covers anything that can happen to the vehicle, from you dogs scratching the interior or exterior, door dings, windshield nicks, replacing your rims if you hit a curb to 24/7 roadside service @ no cost, not even the loaner car.
"
cadillac,xt5,2017,Tomonthebeach, 10/12/2016,Huge improvement over SRX but...,4,"We waited to get the XT5 and bought one of the first batch because Cadillac promised that the CUE system would be greatly improved.  It was not.  After 26,000 miles and a trip hitting 40 states, I would say CUE is still crap and the nav system was easily out of date from the get-go.  To start with, fingers leave streaks because of the glass they used.  When the sun hits the display - you see finger streaks; not much else. The touchscreen requires far too many submenus to achieve even simple tasks.  The navigation system relies on out-dated maps which reflected incorrect speeds easily half the time.  It got lost about once every thousand miles on interstate segments that had been changed at least a couple years earlier based on pavement bleaching.  It has no detour option and will not reroute even after driving 50 miles on a different highway! Traffic warnings were unreliable.  Fortunately if you have a mobile phone supporting Android Auto (AA), that functions like you would expect a luxury car nav system to function.  Android Auto understands my Bulgarian spouse's accent every time - CUE is so bad passengers break out in laughter.  Cadillac should fix the glass, put CUE in the cloud, and pay Google for Android Auto and SIRIUS rather than nickle and diming customers for updates and service - not very classy.  They just hit me up $100 for a nav update 2 years after purchase.  It shoudl have been free - just lime my software system updates.  Time will tell.

When driving, handling is fantastic.  This car can turn inside many sedans with a far shorter radius than our XT5.  Pickup is quite peppy.  Mileage is very good for a car of this class.  The gearshift is counter intuitive, and the transmission sometime hunts for the right gear in stop-n-go traffic.  The fit and finish is good, cargo space excellent, and it has lots of nice feature like ample door storage.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Ron L., 06/07/2016,Update to my initial review,5,"I wrote the below review about nine months ago when I bought the XT5.   I have definitetly changed my rating on this supposedly luxury SUV.   At 2000 miles, the rear spoiler blew off the car on the freeway, nobody hit but real quality, made the American way.   The best news:   at 6,000 miles , the engine BLEW one whole bank of pistons.   Completely new engine took 5 weeks to get in and installed.   I won't go any further other than the fact that if you buy one of these Caddys, expect nothing but headaches.   I recently bought a new 2018 Audi SQ5 and I am now ecstatic I did.   Audi has hit it again with another winner.  So far, this vehicle 
 outperforms and handles 100% better than anything Caddy XT5 has to offer for only 1 grand more.

OLD REVIEW BELOW:

Picked up my new XT5 this past Saturday after doing much research and test driving.   I was not even aware this model was being released by GM this early.   Glad I stopped and looked, drove it and got hooked.
In the past 3 weeks, tested QX5, RX350, BMW X5, GLE and GLS.
I'm very picky when it comes to attention to detail so I tested and looked at many vehicles.   This XT5 is simply amazing for the value and the money compared to some of  the Germans and Japanese brands.  I have been leary about American cars ever since the bailout but tried them out again.  Glad I did...  Without rambling, and after driving all those other vehicles, Caddy was the winner , hands down.    Handling , front, side and rear view amazing, quietness, power, etc were all as good as it gets in my opinion.  I am not a brand loyal person as you can see but I would recommend anyone looking in this category to give the XT5 a good look.
My ONLY picky complaint in the piano black entertainment system panel.   It is a fingerprint magnet.   Told you I was picky.   If anyone has anyone particular questions , you can always ask.
I will be really anxious to see what the National Crash Tests look like once tested.   So far, I am thrilled with my decision

cadillac,xt5,2017,Tom B, 06/16/2016,XT5 one year in,4,"after one full year of ownership I am still very happy with the vehicle. Superb front seats, very good outward visibility and very good MPG especially when used no the speed (cruise) control. Much more precise fuel metering then with your right foot. On board center mputer actually shows my best at 41 on a trip home Friday m the mountains.
Still frustrated with the arrangement of the indicator light for the electronic c parking brake. The design is not logical. Also all of these newer automatic t ansmssins have software quirks in handling higher number of ratios (6,8 or even 9). Not a deal breaker Judy st something you notice. Great road trip car with good cargo capacity.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Mike Valenti, 06/16/2016,Top dealer,5,"My review of 2017 Cadillac XT5, I came out of a 2013 Lincoln MKX which isn’t exactly a dog. The plus sides of Cadillac XT5 it is quieter almost a eerie quiet. The ride is better, Cadillac has always had that baby buggy ride much softer than the Lincoln. XT5 electric power is the best very smooth with a short turning radius. Possibly one of the best new feathers is the new eight speed automatic transmission
Smooth as glass, at eighty miles per hour tach is reading 1950 RPM about 200 less than the Lincoln MKX. Overall Cadillac has a home run on it’s hands, fast smooth and quiet and lets face it knock dead styling. Now go get one.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Ramesh M, 11/01/2016,Another Satisfied Customer - Not great ( updated ),2,"I was not sure about this SUV initially. Did some research before buying. I never owned a Cadillac before and has always owned a Lexus. I was planning to buy a new Van/SUV for my wife as her Toyota Sienna has done 68000 miles on it. Even though the Sienna is a great van, I did not like the fact that AWD has the Run Flat Tires on them, which gives it a bumpy ride and is expensive replacing the tires as it cannot be repaired otherwise it was a great family vehicle for us. My son has been learning to drive and it was also did not look good for him as he was driving a family van. Since my Sienna was well maintained, I good a good appraisal for it, so we decided to buy new car. Initially we saw Pacifica, which my wife did not like - quality of the vehicle was in question. Then we took a test drive in Cadillac xt5, Very good ride, excellent quality overall. People talk about the Cue not being fast enough, I think the Cue is much better than the system in my 2014 MB ML350. I also noted that the xt5 does not have a CD player - which i don't mind as we never use CDs anymore, as we have learned to use USBs/SD cards. The vehicle has 2 USB port in the front console and 2 for the back seats, I would have expected Cadillac to have SD card reader installed - but not a big deal. The other issue is the cargo space, it could have been little bit bigger, the head clearance for back seat is 2 inches short when compared to Lexus RX - hope Cadillac brings an SUV with little bit more space for the back passengers and cargo. There is no other choice, either you go for xt5, or Escalade which is huge. Over all very happy. Have to wait and see how it holds up to its reputation.
         The above was my earlier review. Currently my SUV is with the dealer with complete black out of CUE system. Why driving the CUE system completely went dead and an error message saying "" waiting for update media"" and ""copying 0/100"" appeared. I absolutely have no control on navigation, blue tooth etc. The service guy does not know what it means and said their technical guy in off. Its been 4 days and no answer yet. Ended up going to Cadillac owners forum and found out other XT5 owners having same problem and the fis is ti install"" human interface module"" and have to wait for that part to arrive. So frustrated that a SUV that is done 1400 miles and 3 weeks old in service station? what kind of quality they have in their car? I miss my Toyota van and made a blunder buying XT5 instead of Lexus RX350. No more Cadillac.
UPDATE: - SOLD IT AT A LOSS

cadillac,xt5,2017,first time caddie owner, 07/18/2017,so far so good,5,"Level smooth ride, at least with my edition, enjoyable to drive, great leg and head room, no mechanical issues of any kind knock wood,  many features included such as remote start/height adjustable and hands free trunk, easy entry exit no side steps required. Seats are comfortable but a greater number of adjustment such as upper split bending/massage option wouldn't hurt.  You might want to order or get one with a spare tire as it's an option otherwise comes with an air compressor not good for certain flats but has roadside assistance.  The start stop function stopped working perhaps as the battery is slightly lower which is normal for lack of use but it's much better that way anyhow as there is no off on switch. There are improvements I would make for future editions such as fog lights, mirror turn signals automatic parking display when entering a parking space instead of only after reverse, less menus inside of menus by having more buttons, some materials are sensitive and delicate such as the dash velour so you have to be careful, I don't think the tires have rim protectors on these vehicles, add color changeable ambient lighting inside, night vision option for animal pedestrian detection which is available on some of their other vehicles.  For the price it's hard to beat when you add it all up.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Ruth, 09/30/2016,Really fun to drive,5,"I upgraded from a Honda CRV (which was great).  However, in this car I feel like a queen.  I really like the safety features that tell me that a car or pedestrian is approaching and from where.  When there is a danger, the driver seat vibrates that alerts you to look at instruments to see what the problem is.  I was disappointed that there is no CD player.  CDs may be on the way out, but most of us still have favorite CDs.  It would be nice to be able to use them.  Also, I was disappointed that no spare tire (unless it is purchased as an addition) or donut was provided.  I only received a can of ""stuff"" to inflate my tire.  However, Cadillac does provide excellent roadside assistance so I won't have to purchase that with my insurance.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who would like a really neat SUV.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Drew Barab, 01/09/2017,First Cadillac - a pleasure to drive,5,"Have had the car about a month. It came equipped with all of the safety tech that I wanted. Because of Edmunds and the Cadillac site, I was able to see all of the available inventory in the four states that would sell to me without sales tax (because I live in OR where there is no sales tax).  I read just about every review on this car. Seems like the reviewers were of two minds on this SUV - either they thought it was a rough ride that was not very sound proofed or a smooth ride that is very quiet. Some complained about the CUE system. I find the car to be a very smooth ride and quieter than my Lexus RX350. The CUE system is much more user friendly than the systems in the BMW and Mercedes to me. Neither of them have a touch screen. Using a mouse/touchpad and trying to maneuver it while keeping your eyes on the road is not user friendly as far as I am concerned. There is a bit of a learning curve, but certainly nothing like the other systems.

cadillac,xt5,2017,C. Young, 05/30/2017,Four transmitter failures in 7 months,2,"Leased XT5 Oct. 9, 2016.  On Dec. 3, 2017, Feb. 14, 2017 and May 13, 2017 the transmitter that locks/unlocks doors, starts and stops the engine failed.  This is a total of four failures in 7 months (including the one that came with the car). The 'patch' solution is to place the transmitter in a cradle at the bottom of the center console (a solution I discovered in the owner's manual when on a dirt road in AZ, late on a freezing cold afternoon by myself) when the car would not turn on.  However, in the case of car not turning off, the doors won't lock if the transmitter is out of the cradle.  So when out of the car, the car has to remain unlocked.  I'm a travel writer covering 5 states.  This means my car has been left unlocked in hotel parking lots many a night.  I'm a woman, usually traveling by myself, and I can't trust this car will start or stop.  The car hasn't started twice and the engine hasn't stopped twice so far.  The transmitter has been failing about every three months.

cadillac,xt5,2017,drramesh28, 08/30/2017,Horrible Reliability,1,"I bought his Cadillac XT5 thinking I could give business to native company. I was debating between this and Lexus RX. Made a big mistake buying it. I traded my wonderful Toyota Seinna as it has done 70,000 miles ( It drove and was more reliable than this Cadillac XT5). The SUV was good for about a month then problem after problem.
1) The Central touch screen went dead within a few weeks of owing the vehicle and it took almost 10 days for them to fix it as it has to come from the company. When I got my vehicle back after 2 weeks, found that they removed the dash and was not fixed properly as the dash close to the passenger side was misaligned and the under dash led light was also not fixed properly and I have to fix it myself as I don't want my vehicle to sit at the dealer for another week.
2) I went out of Country for 2 weeks and when I came back found that the SUV will not start and called roadside assistance, they came and jump started the SUV with a Jump starter ( are you guys kidding me, its a brand new SUV that has done only 1000 miles) -  it took a week for them to fix it.
3) Rattling sound coming from rear seat - which I fixed myself after buying some insulation material from Lowes.
4) ""Crispy sound"" coming from electrical box located below the left side of driver side dash. The fine crispy sound comes every time I accelerate from 0-30 miles and then disappears - took the SUV to the dealer - they said that everything sounds good ( they don't want to acknowledge)
5) After the battery issue was fixed, I started seeing that the voltage of the battery started falling again after a week coming back from the dealer - per dealer, the rear brake light was constantly lighting up ( the company had a recall for this as per the dealer).
6) My car has made multiple visits to the dealership in 6 months of owning it - Horrible reliability.
Went against Consumer reports rating about reliability and purchased this vehicle and I got burned. Don't waste your money. I ended up selling this vehicle after owning it only for 6 months.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Fredrick Dobbs, 07/12/2016,Oh You Cad.,3,"This is a second shot at a review after 2000 miles and a fairly long trip of all day driving. First of all. The acceleration is wonderful. The handing is not Lazy boy Cadillac, it's sporty handling corners like a sporty SUV which I guess it is from the performance. Love the handling. Love the silence on the road. I have residual hearing problems from big guns in the military and even with my dodgy hearing I can easily hear my music and audio books on trips, not to mention the helpful musings of my spouse. Braking is excellent if not a tad touchy. You do not have to stomp on these brakes. I love the safety features like lane change warnings, rear crossing warnings and the back up camera although I have never got the need for the digital track in the rear camera to bend its my turning. I know I'm turning. I am very gratified that an American company is making a car of this apparent quality. It gives nothing to the off shore imports. This car is a stand out in a city where you can't swing a dead possum without hitting a BMW and Mercedes. It seems to be some kind of cultural imperative but I've had my share of complements even though I doubt many people look carefully enough to distinguish it from a SRX. The overall appearance of the exterior and mechanicals is stunning and the color I selected, Silver Coast is a stealth car wash avoidance feature. It hides the dirt wonderfully when I am negligent on washing the car.  one last small gripe. I don't like the design of the 18 inch wheels. Kind of seventies looking. Cadillac could do better. Look on the web to get some ideas. My single annoyance with this part of the car and it is a BIG one, is the inability to turn off the stop/start mechanism. You can off foot it and you get lurches. It is not as clever as the propeller hat engineers who designed it think it is. I hate it and would not buy the car again. I can find just about any other car that allows you to disable this dubious feature including other Cadillac models. It works off the brake and you can fool it. If you are at a signal and the engine turns off, just lift your foot off the brake and it will start again. Depressing the brake again while you are waiting will not shut it off a second time. I am not thrilled with the XT two step.  I want to get this all praise out because I think this is a Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hide car. Mr Hide designed the interior. The dash lights adjust automatically and are too dim in day light for me. I can not manually adjust them higher. They brighten in a parking structure and at night and you can dim them down with the dimmer switch but that switch does nothing to brighten the dash lights in the day. This forces me to use the window with a large numeral for speed determination. This is a problem because of the propensity for the dash to reflect overhead sun at certain times of the day. In fact, same said genius engineer also probably designed the center information center with insufficient shading and helpfully tilted the screen toward to windshield at the top just to make sure that you don't miss getting the screen compromised by the sun reflection.  You can play CSI and count your finger prints on it for lack of seeing other information. The seat is my biggest interior problem. My wife's RX350 has wonderful seats. She is looking for a new car and ruled out the XT5 because of the hard seats and the uncomfortable lumbar support. I have the same complaint. Hard seating not good for long drives. bothers my leg. I had to get a piece of memory foam which my spouse sewed up in a cover to put on the seat. This is a sport seat and not suitable for a SUV in my opinion. All the SUVs I have ridden in and owned have had more comfortable seats. Again. Live with this car before you buy. Rent one and see if the seat suits your back side. I hate them which makes it awkward for a car I now own.  As I said, I am tall
 and large. When I sit with the seat back, it is obvious they thought to put in a long seat track for tall people but then failed to accommodate any other interior feature to this seating position. The center console is difficult if not nearly impossible to get into. The dash information center is way too far away. The door panels bow out near the front of the car then conveniently bow back in to crowd your arm. Another thing that escapes me is the logic of the seat memory. In any other car you press the memory button and number one for example to set your seat and in the future you just tap the button to make the seat move. In the XT, you have to lean on the button for the entire trip and if you stop pressing, the seat stops moving. To have the seat work automatically you have to turn on a feature in settings. After you do that the car resists any further changes. You have to turn it off to reset memory. In my case that is far too frequently because the seat does not seem to hold the back rest angle and must be readjusted periodically. Brilliant outside, not inside.

cadillac,xt5,2017,James, 08/02/2018,XT5 Huge mistake,1,"What a disappointment.  2nd Cadillac.  CTS was great until the cue system failed.  Gave GM another chance figured maybe in three yrs they would have improved their product.  My XT5 drivers seat replaced at 3k.  Leather became brittle?  Go figure.  Bad cow I guess.  Front door molding buckled at corners both sides replaced as well.  Paint actually started coming off all four wheels.  In shop now as all wheels have to be repainted.  Horrible ride.  My F150 rides better.  And who actually thought the auto stop was a good idea?  You really should have driven this thing for a month before you marketed it to the rest of us.  In a loaner again.  So mad at myself for thinking GM could produce a quality product.  Now facing rediculous depreciation and couldn’t trade if I wanted to unless I’m ok eating 20k.  By the Lexus.

cadillac,xt5,2017,TM145, 01/14/2018,Poor Gas Mileage,3,"First of all, I love the way the XT5 drives. It has a smooth, but sporty feel. The seats are comfortable for me.  The back seat is OK but not super roomy.  The cargo area isn't bad either.  I can put a lot of groceries in the cargo area.  The moving bar that is in the cargo area tends to rattle a little bit and it's annoying.  I absolutely hate that the stop/start feature cannot be turned off.  The sound system is medium.  And the infotainment is easy to use and convenient. The gear shift is annoying when shifting into reverse.  Sometimes it takes a couple or three tries.  The interior is pretty and I love the various pages for the dash.  Android Auto works well and helps to keep my eyes on the road.  The large sunroof is great and I love that I can cover it on sunny days.  I've owned the car for about 8 months without any mechanical issues yet.  My gripe is the gas mileage is horrible.  It's supposed to get 19 mpg in the city but I'm only getting 11-12 while driving around town.  The freeway MPG isn't bad (20 plus).  I work out of my home and most of my trips are fairly short.  My Toyota Sequoia got better gas mileage around town.  The poor MPG might be a deal breaker for me.  I purchased a small SUV to get better gas mileage.  This car is thirsty.

Upon pulling in my garage today, the transmission light has come on again. I’m starting to notice that the transmission feels like it’s slipping. Calling again to have it checked/fixed. Stop/idle function  function is no longer working. And I to have a rattling noise in the backseat that I cannot locate. Sadly I have paid my SUV off already. Under warranty so I anticipate immediate resolution.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Klwarren100, 08/06/2018,Could've Bought a BMW,3,"Buyer beware. First off, don't get your Cadillac from Arnie Buaer. Initially, the service was great and then I stepped in the car to drive away with the salesperson and it was not what I initially sat it. It had no heated seats and it had miles on it and I initially sat in a new car ( I had heated seats in my Terrain that I traded in). So anyway, get the car home and weeks later, I'm hearing a weird noice and it's the brakes. I shouldn't hear anything on a brand new car let alone a Cadillac that I'm paying and arm and a leg to have. I've had the car in the shop several time regarding the brakes. In car with my daughter, the car wouldn't let me drive it, it was so bad. Turn's out it was a chip that was related to the brakes after me bringing the car in multiple times, the finally get that squared away. So the last brake incident in July , my oil and tire rotation was supposed to be done, so I would not have to see these 🤡 for. Long time as I feel like I'm there all of the time (for a 2018 Cadillac). I get an email that I need an oil change and then my car indicate that on the display. I call the dealership and said I thought you changed my oil and the lady said that the computer said yeah it says right here that you're not due til March. I said well, my sucker says December of this year. So she says come in so we can take the light out. How bout actually doing the oil change. I'm so disgusted as I bought a Terrain at this same dealership. I can't even enjoy the car, as I've had so many issues. Never again!!! I could've spent the money on a BMW and dealt with less nonsense.

Update 8/6/2020- Nightmare. Car in shop again as we speak. Just had car checked 2 days prior. They claimed it was okay. Then it wouldn't start.  I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Constantly in shop. To pay for luxury and the product run old jalopy is insane. It's a 2018 and it's only 2020. Never again.

cadillac,xt5,2017,thefranklin1, 10/26/2017,Had me....lost me,2,"On the way home from purchase, XT5 developed loud grinding noise on left side.  People were pointing and staring.  Car had to be towed in.  Dealership sales good about providing loaner.  Got it back with loud vibrating buzz from liftgate area when on almost anything but fresh paved roads.  Dealer advised Cadillac aware of this problem as a number of complaints.  Haven't engineered a solution, but working on it?  ""Could be 2 days, 2 weeks or....""  I'll just have to wait- but service says they'll follow up every so often.  In 5 weeks of ownership car has been in for service problems 4 times!!!  Have owned many, many cars in my 66 years but none like this.  Design is good, right size, fuel economy OK.  Fairly comfortable but ride is a little hard.  Dealership has been great but still stuck with a car with what appears to be an unsolvable problem.  Numerous rattles and squeaks.  At this point, car is still in shop.

I contacted the service dept. at the dealer about 2 weeks ago and the service adviser didn't even seem to know that the XT5 had a no-turn- off start/stop system so he told me to just keep driving. I then called the salesman who told me to drive the car until the weather cooled down to see if it would turn off on its own. Today I visited the dealer's service department to make sure that I was not injuring the cat since it does seem to try to turn off at the same intersections that it used to. Today's service adviser printed off reasons that the system does not work and they are the same reasons that I saw long ago on the internet or in the manual. He told me to just drive the car normally and that I would get a warning from the car if something was wrong.  He also assured me that there are many XT5's out here and that none has reported a start/stop problem, although he did not bother to check my car.

cadillac,xt5,2017,CK, 01/10/2017,XT5 - Buyers Remorse,2,"Over the years I've had very good luck and have been satisfied with several vehicles in the GM family...(Yukon, C5 Corvette, 2014 Stingray and two SRXs).  My previous vehicles operationed beautifully and I was often very happy with the driving exprience.  Given my good luck with GM, I decided to jump into the XT5 (FWD Premium Luxury Package).  The styling is terrific and the car is comfortble.  However, the instrument cluster is a recycled dash of the previous SRX but with illumination that is way too dim for day light driving.  The result is a dull, lackluster display not befitting a luxury flagship vehicle.  The Auto/Stop function is downright annoying and possibly even dangerous in heavy stop and go traffic.  With the vehicle shutting off / stalling all the time it gives the driver a very uneasy feeling when you need sudden acceleration, such as in making sudden turn in an intersection.  GM HAS to disable and or allow the driver to opt out of this feature.  Now, with only two weeks of owning my XT5, the entire Cue system has gone haywire and is blacking out and turning on and off at will.  Buyers remorse is an understatement. This flagship line of GM has been struggling for better market share and without a little more thought, time and real world testing, the XT5 and Cadillac for that matter will find itself lagging behind the completion and may fail all together.   Seek out other vehicle options or stick with the SRX until GM sorts out the bugs and design issues.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Bill, 09/03/2016,Our New XT5,3,"Bought 2010 SRX new, loved it except the 3.0 engine. Luxury model white with tan interior.  Just sold that car and bought a 2017 XT5 Luxury model White with Tan interior.  Engine is great with plenty of power fit and finish is perfect.  I was a little disappointed that Cadillac trimmed a few options from the luxury model I purchased before like:  no cd player, sill plates no longer have a light in them, there is no longer a horizontal interior dash trim  light, tan interior no longer offered in tan headliner with tan carpet only in black. Front seats need a little more attention to front bottom bolsters, (need more padding).  Except for the dashboard the whole interior seemed a bit cheap compared to the SRX.   

I have to say the vehicle has the  same gas milege even though it has a bigger engine,  Bose system sounds great, (I hate it has no built-in cd),

2019 UPDATE:
Transmission whines and make a clicking noise when it shifts, took it in several times and dealer said that is what it is supposed to sound like.  Car, in general, is not very quiet with road-noise, the whining, and clicking it is as if the manufacturer did not put enough soundproofing in the cabin and engine compartment...   Stock Michelin tires too hard and only got 30k miles and need replacing.  Tires made the car ride rough.  I had to take the car back to service 4 times to fix the driver's seat.
At 3 years I am not satisfied with the XT5 and service and will not buy my next new vehicle from Cadillac, guys you dropped the ball.

I went to the Grand Prize Cadillac dealer in Nanuet. Linda was our salesperson. She is patient, wonderful and knowledgeable no pressure what so ever. The car was really great.

Other vehicles driven/looked at BMW X5/3, Audi Q5, Highlander, Kia Sorrento, Murano. I realize some of these vehicles are not considered ""luxury"" but looked at them anyway. Criteria is a top safety pick or better and average or better reliability. Unsure if XT5 will meet safety whenever it is tested. hoping it will last for 3 LEASE YEARS. If anyone has any experience or thoughts please feel free. I called corporate Cadillac they are unsure if and when they vehicle will be tested. If I was them I would be making sure it gets tested.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Former Sports Car Owner, 01/19/2019,My first SUV,5,"Was a little hesitant to purchase an SUV after owning 2 door sports cars. I have been pleasantly surprised with the the vehicle. Interior is comfortable and visibility is is good. However, there is a slight blind spot when turning left from the drivers seat. I'm sort so I need to lean forward to make sure I miss the meridian. I was a bit surprised that the handling in the snow is not all that great. Great clearance, but that may because I am use to lower sports cards. Owned and Audi and BMW, both AWD. I honestly did not think there would be a significant difference in handling based on more clearance. However, there is much more slippage in the FWD. Amazing after owning AWD the difference though there is more clearance. I've also noticed the car is not as quiet as my other cars. It's not terrible but noticeable in comparison. Car is luxurious and comfortable. Plenty of leg room in both the front and back. Love the extra space in the trunk and plenty of elbow room in the front. Heated seats are amazing, nice options and features with Bluetooth and remote start. Car starts from a further distance than my other vehicles and I like to emote access app to start the car from anywhere. Interior illumination is very nice and like the exterior illuminated handles at night. Some features are a bit frustrating since you cannot set some options when the car is moving, such as navigation; which is annoying. Sound system is better than average. Opted for the white interior with cooled seats. Seats cool quickly, much nicer than the 6 Series BMW. The same is true for the heated steering wheel and seats. Sound is good when listening to text messages ad make calls. Struggling a bit with the Android Auto as the features do not load easily like they did when my daughter connected her IPhone; she had no issues with the apps appearing - very easy to connect the IPhone. I travel a lot for work and the car is very comfortable and I never have issues with back pain. Seats recline and move forward and backward with ease and very comfortable. The lumber only offers forward and back but not up and down which is not as good as the BMW because if you are tall or short the lumber may not be in the correct location based on your size. Love the auto feature on the truck which opens to different height based on the setting. Rear seats recline slightly, not too far but it is nice. Rear seats are also easy to lay flat when transporting large cargo. Rear center armrest is generous in size but front armrest storage is a bit small and tight. Like the phone charger, slide it in and it charges with no cable. Nice feature not offered in the BMW or Audi. Overall, nice vehicle and I don't know that I'll return to a sports car. However, in the future, I will purchase the AWD since I live in a snowy climate (didn't think it would be that big of a deal - wrong); I got a great deal which I could not pass up from the dealer. GREAT CAR but get the AWD if you live in the Midwest.

On to the important stuff. Once I got the car and drove it for a week, I noticed a rough riding, quirky gas hog that had all kinds of electrical gremlins. The ride is harder than my F-150 pickup! No lie? That short"" break in period "" promised never came about. Gas mileage is aweful. 16 mpg around town with the small engine and 19 on the highway, with a very conservative driver. And only FWD. On to the Gremlins. It started when it wouldn't go into reverse. It's an electronic shifter, not like your conventional cars. On one occasion, it took 15 tries to get it into reverse. Shifting of the 8 speed transmission is sloppy and felt like it's slipping. I was told by the dealer"" It's the normal way it shifts"" . Really? The lift gate would just stop working. Wouldn't work with remote, inside button or outside  switch. The Bose stereo would go flat like my 1960 transistor radio.  Then pop back into this century at any given time. Overall, the quality of the radio was poor anyway. Not up to Bose standard. And the car has unusually loud noise from wind and tires. It is actually distracting to drive for long distances. After about 2,000 miles, a loud clunk could be heard coming from the transmission. Another issue looked at by the dealer but ""could not duplicate."" I could go on and on but I'll wrap it up. Wipers come on for no reason and don't come on when they are suppose to in auto mode. Poor  tracking, seems to chart it's own course going down the road. A recall later and several trips to the dealer has cured nothing. My final word, I looked up Cadillac and found they are 2nd to the worst for ""lemon law "" complaints. Should have done a little more research. Could have saved a bundle of money.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Martyman47, 04/20/2017,Very Disappointing for the money,3,"I owned three (2010, 2012 & 2014) Cadillac SRXs before I leased the XT5.  If I never drove those cars my rating for the XT5 would have been higher.  But the SRX was so much more car for a lot less money.  The XT5 drives about the same as the SRX but the SRX was more luxurious.  It felt more robust too.  The interior of the XT5 is a lot less luxurious as the SRX.  In all the car is a disappointment especially considering it cost $5,000 more than the same 2014 SRX model and has fewer options.  I wish I had kept my SRX.
"
cadillac,xt5,2017,MEK, 04/25/2017,I love this car,5,"I've test driven almost every SUV available and this is the best one of the lot. Have you ever driven an SUV and thought it must be similar to driving a boat on the water? Yeah, me too. Until I test drove this one - it's actually a lot of FUN to drive! The XT5 has an excellent balance between comfort and handling. It's like driving a small sports car, it handles really well and has great pickup. I've only had it for about a month, but so far it seems super reliable. I expect this car to last a very long time. I'm also super impressed with Cadillac customer service - no other car brand seems to even come close to providing the same level of support. I have consistently felt like they want to build a lifelong relationship with me, not just sell me a car. I understand now why Cadillac customers are so loyal.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Kyle Johnson, 12/15/2017,Pleased with my purchase,5,"I am very happy with this purchase.  High notes.  Love the styling, smooth ride, quietness and on board technology.  I've been pleasantly surprised with the fuel mileage, averaging just over 27 MPG and getting nearly 29 on a couple of road trips.  My daily commute is on a two lane highway so I may be getting a bit better than someone who has to drive in heavy city traffic or stop and go.  I have 2 minor complaints.  When the headlights are on the bright setting, it seems like they should illuminate out further than they do.  My other complaint is with the lane departure feature.  I'm good with a vibrating seat or flashing light or even a chime or buzzer.  I don't like that the vehicle will actually attempt to slightly maneuver the steering wheel in the direction it thinks the car needs to go.  While it makes the correct decision most of the time, there are driving situations where it does not.  In those instances, I have to ""fight"" the steering to override the decision and often end up over-correcting.  Not to the point where I would call it dangerous, but, to the point where I would call it annoying.  Also, I have a slight concern about what could happen when driving on a slippery surface and this happens.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased and really am enjoying the vehicle.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Bill, 07/14/2017,Owned less than a year...,1,"...due to very poor interior build quality and horrible start/stop.  Rattles and squeaks from day one.  Did not have the patience to keep returning to the dealer.  The start/stop engages at 2 mph or less.  Why would it engage it anything other than zero??  The final 2 feet in the garage was a daily frustration. The engine and transmission were also disappointing....much weaker performance than you would expect from 310 hp.  Passing is a chore to get the revs to a level that allow the car to pass.  Second Cadillac...last Cadillac.  It cost me $15k of year one depreciation to get into a rattle free car.  I'm very happy with my new Audi allroad.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Larry N, 11/02/2016,Happy Folks,4,"We have been driving Cadillacs since 1990 and always enjoyed them very much. Our first bucket seats were in our 2002 4 door sedan. We are older folks and have never enjoyed the Cadillac bucket seats. We had a 2013 DTS and those seats did not fit our needs very well. We had to purchase kitchen chair pads from Walmart to get us out of the hole we were in with the vehicle. When we got our 2017 XT5 we thought maybe the seats might be better, nope the same old seats. A friend suggested we visit a Relax The Back store and look at one of their seat units. We did and bought one for our new car. We drove the car from Minn. to Arizona and found the new seat worked just great. When we arrived in Arizona we went right out to a store and bought another unit for the rider seat. This is the first SUV we have ever owned, we have to say we enjoy it very much. It's so much easier to get in and out of this style vehicle. The good news, no more hitting of my head when I get into this car.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Vickey woodley, 02/17/2019,Very disappointed,2,"I traded my 2015 SRX (which I liked) for this roomier car which I thought was beautiful.  Unfortunately I must have received a “lemon”.  The electronics on this car gave me so much trouble the first year.  Stop, start feature didn’t work, bad key fob, alarm system randomly going off, heated seats and steering wheel quit working, etc) Another mistake on my part was to lease the car.  Neither the dealership or GM was willing to work with me on getting out of this lease .  I wanted to buy another Cadillac from them but no deal. Appears I’m stuck with this car that I have rented for 2 1/2 years.  I think Cadillac makes a good product, just not this particular one. I definitely will not go back to the same dealership but not sure about purchasing another GM product

cadillac,xt5,2017,M Pittman, 03/29/2019,Look out when warranty wnd,3,"Bought my 2017 Cadillac XT5 as soon as this new model arrived at the dealership.  Was excited to take delivery.  I had no problems whatsoever during the first 25000 miles except the wireless charger never worked with my iPhone 8plus. The dealership could never explain why so it still doesn’t work.  After about 25.000 miles, occasionally when I would put my vehicle into gear the SUV would jerk horribly.  The dealership explained it was a XT5 design flaw and would not cause any problems just a jerk. Mmmm??  Fast forward to 50,100 miles and out of warranty...blind spot monitor goes completely out, electronic system will not read either one of the key fobs even after battery changes, rear camera will not work, tires start peeling and have to be replaced (20” Michelan tires).  I decided after expensive repairs to look in to trading it in.  Much to my surprise my 54,000 Cadillac is now worth at best (and trust me I baby my vehicles) 29,000.   Let me say this.... I will think long and hard before I purchase another Cadillac.  VERY disappointed!

cadillac,xt5,2017,Howard Arner, 04/16/2017,"Caddy XT5 ""Finally""",5,"I always wanted an SRX but now that only n3: 1 car finally pulled the trigger and bought an XT5.  The vehicle is eve4ything that I thought it would be. Have had it for a month and just took my 1st road trip.  Had to adjust the front seat as after 2.5 hours felt a little hard. Otherwise comfort, handling, fuel mileage, etc were great. I bought one of the loaner cars with 5,000 miles on it. They gave me added warranty miles for maintenance program and vehicle is still new but saved about 10%. Well worth it.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. Good for family or empty nesters or single person.  Also, really like how the trailer hitch I'd hidden by the bumper when not using it.  Take a test drive and you'll end up buying one.

cadillac,xt5,2017,CBrown, 03/06/2018,Hate it,2,"Lots of transmission problems.  Lots of hard shifts, wil not go into gear, etc.  Shift points are a mess and force you to floor it to get a downshift when all you need is moderate acceleration.  Autostart/stop cannot be disabled and makes for a jerky ride - everyone comments on it.  Quality of materials is maybe at chevy levels.  Apple car play has tons of problems.  Good points are that it is very quiet and is a pleasure to drive on the highway.  Overall, this car is a major step backwards from SRX.

cadillac,xt5,2017,Joe Pearce, 02/11/2018,Disappointed,2,"I purchased a white 2017 Cadillac XT5 Platinum on 12/31/2016.  It has all the bells and whistles you could imagine.  My main problem is with the ride - rides like a ""real"" wagon.  Very rough.  You'd think paying $65,000 for a car would give me a better ride.  Another ""feature"" I do not like is when I come to a complete stop - the engine stops.  I was told that was a feature to save gas and can not be uninstalled.  I ask you, when I pay $65,000 for an automobile - do you think I'm concerned with whether I get 20 mpg or 22 mpg?  It is annoying that every time I stop - the engine quits.  I'll not purchase another vehicle with this feature.

Three days later, I called to check on the progress.  I was told they had not begun on the car yet.  When I asked about my appointment and was told the part was in, why had they not started on the car.  I was told the appointment put me in ""line"" with a technician.  I called Thursday and was told they started on the car and it should be ready that day or on Friday.  It is now Friday.  I just called and was told the ""ordered part"" was damaged and they would have to reorder one (guess they haven't already don so).  It would be Tuesday of next week. REALLY?

Do your homework."
cadillac,xt5,2017,Eric, 12/05/2020,Quiet and Comfortable,5,"I purchased a pre-owned 2017 XT5 Luxury with low miles in excellent condition. It's the quietest and most comfortable car I've driven. Outward visibility is great all around. I've read reviews saying the XT5 has poor visibility out the back, but I don't find this to be true at all. I can see out the back, sides and rearview mirror completely fine, so I'm not sure what the problem is that others are experiencing. 

The seats are extremely comfortable. The driver's seat is the most comfortable I've driven in. One major pro that no one seems to mention is the floor in the back seat is completely flat. I looked at the BMW X1, Volvo XC60, Mercedes GLC and Mazda CX-5, and they all have the big hump on the floor in front of the middle seat. The flat floor was a big deal for me when buying. If you have kids with car seats in the backseat, having a flat floor in the back makes it much easier to slide in/out the car with kids.

My XT5 is very quiet inside. Road noise and engine noise are almost non-existent. Not sure why some people say this car is loud. Maybe if you have the Premium Luxury or Platinum model, which have larger wheels, that can contribute to a rougher/louder ride. The start/stop engine doesn't bother me at all. I can hardly hear it or feel it when it engages. My last two cars had the engine start/stop feature so I'm also used to it, so doesn't bother me at all.

Another major plus about the XT5, it has a V6 that runs on regular gas. I realized paying more money at the pump for premium gas with a BMW, Mercedes or Volvo would be stupid. As if gas isn't expensive enough.

I love the electronic gear shifter, this is my first SUV with one. My last two SUV's had mechanical gear shifter which feel archaic now. Yes, reverse in the XT5 is up and to the left. It's so easy, I don't understand why some people complain about this. It's foolproof and took me two seconds to get used to. The shifter is also perfectly placed where I naturally lay my right arm/hand when driving.

If you're looking for a smooth, quiet and comfortale ride I have to recommend the XT5. It also has many other comfort and safety features that all work as advertised. The Cadillac CUE system is pretty intuitive and simple to use. Long term reliability has yet to be seen, but I've never had any major problems with my other cars, so I don't expect any issues with my XT5 as long as I schedule routine maintenance.

cadillac,xt5,2018,Afam Naper (pen name), 02/04/2018,Exceptional Vehicle,5,"I love my XT5.  I am in my mid-forties and never thought I would be so car crazy.  This vehicle is perfect.  Lots of tech features.  Some of the things I have been pleasantly surprised by is the visibility and handling in bad weather conditions and at night.  I also like the ability to switch transmission from front wheel, AWD, and sport mode.  Sport mode is fun and it gives a little mid-life crisis sport car feel or at least as close as you can get when trying to be practical with a family of 5.  I live in the Midwest and so deal with the four seasons.  This car cruises through them all.   If I had only one complaint is the start/stop feature and gas mileage - not great.  I am completely used to it, but prefer it didn't have it and perhaps a bit better on gas.   I looked at all the luxury models and this had the best combination of styling, technology, comfort, and overall handling.   Wife loves the vehicle and the kids love the vehicle which isn't easy since all of them have their opinions and different preferences.   I have been in a number of accidents unfortunately and the safety features make me feel really safe.   I cannot recommend this SUV enough.  I also think the styling competes and in some cases out class it's foreign competitors and brings something that is uniquely American to it.

cadillac,xt5,2018,Shot, 01/12/2018,XT5 Platinum 2017 AWD,5,"My previous SUV was a Jeep 4wd. After 3 good years the warranty was up and I wanted a sportier SUV. I was looking at the AMG GL43 and the Porsche Macan GTS. Both great vehicles, fast, but expensive. Cadillac was offering 5 years 0 percent interest. So on a whim we went to look at the XT5. We opened the door of the Platinum and my first response was OMG. The interior design, materials,fit and finishes were 5 Star. The Cadillac has a nice exterior design, is very spacious, a large tilting back seat, with lots of storage. The engine and transmission are very smooth. The front seats, instrumentation, NAV, safety features are excellent. And the ride is very smooth especially for long road trips. Yes, this SUV is not as fast or sporty as the two German SUV’s that I was considering. But the XT5 is larger, quieter, well designed and is far less expensive. I drive it in the AWD mode all the time so the handling is acceptable for an SUV. For me, the Cadillac was the way to go. I would recommend this vehicle.

cadillac,xt5,2018,Gary Cox, 08/29/2018,First Cadillac,5,"We purchased an XT5 about a month ago and love it.  We have always bought GM products but this is our first Cadillac.  The trim level is Platinum and came with all the bells and whistles.  The rear view camera is fantastic.  It is so much better than just the rear view mirror and is much safer.  My wife and I believe it should be standard on all cars and trucks for safety reasons.  The back seat legroom is still a little tight, but, we are moving from a Tahoe to the XT5.  I saw where some people did not like the start stop feature.  This feature can be turned off using the menu options.  We had the dealer do it for us.  By the way. our dealer was fantastic.  We look forward to owning this vehicle for a long time.

The rear view camera is so much better than the Lexus.  The side mirrors with the yellow light that warns of a car in the blind spot is a life saver.  I will certainly lease a Cadillac in the future!

The front seats can not be adjusted up in the back enough for my wife and also I could use a little more adjustment myself. That is not the biggest problem, the front seat ventilation is almost not existent, I took it to the dealer and was told everything worked as designed. They also said they have heard this complaint before. I have had this feature on other cars, GMC, Lexus, Buick, and Avalone. So I am use to useing this feature since I live in Phoenix.

cadillac,xt5,2018,jjuwsnyc, 12/13/2017,Poor fuel economy. Very uncomfortable front seats.,3,"So I discovered that the headrest does not adjust. This is now standard on Mercedes. glc, audi q5. The pain that i had in my neck extending down to my lower back was not bearable. I tried to sell the car privately and to lease swap it. But no good. The vehicle dropped 14K in value with less then 1500 miles. I finally got a dealer to up the price by 4K from the low ball offered even at  Cadillac dealer that did not have any inventory. So I am thankfully finished with this car. It is beautiful, but for me the seat was so bad that I was willing to sacrifice over 11K to get rid of this car.  As for GM financial. I have called 7 times to get a letter showing that the vehicle was paid off and purchased. i have been told so many different stories. All incorrect. The letter is not generated. It would be generated, It has been generated. Nothing. ON hold for hours. I will not ever walk into a GM dealership ever again.

UPDATE. I AM SO GLAD TO BE RID OF THIS CAR, EVEN THOUGH IT COST ME MORE THAN 10K.

cadillac,xt5,2018,easy undercarriage damage, 04/16/2018,$750 to replace exposed plastic tube - Otherwise +,4,"There is limited protection of the undercarriage components. A cheap little plastic vent tube to the fuel tank is exposed under the vehicle and subject to damage. THE DRIVE SHAFT OF THE VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED to replace the little plastic tube exposed to the bottom of the vehicle. There was no known event that caused this damage - it appears rolling over anything like a twig can cause the brittle plastic tube to snap. It has never been off road. I am on my first $750 repair to replace this tube. I could see that this could easily happen on a recurring basis.

OTHERWISE - the car has been good. Seats very comfortable, info system is easy to manage. Bought a 2020 Lexus 350L and the Cadillac is preferred.

cadillac,xt5,2018,Edge, 03/14/2019,Decent Cadillac but there are better vehicles out,4,"Love the style & color choices. Decent ride & decent power. For the price GM wants for this vehicle, they could of used the 335 HP 3.6 V6 instead of the 310HP 3.6 V6. The 8 speed transmission isnt the best either. The car always feels like it is in the wrong gear & downshifts are delayed. Not a fan of their pricing compared to their standard feature list. Out of the 4 trim levels, I opted for the Luxury Trim with optional paint & the drivers awareness package.  In my opinion, the drivers awareness package should be standard & should include standard full A.E.B and adaptive C.C.  My 2017 Subaru Outback 3.6R has Eyesight with full A.E.B & adaptive C.C standard, for much less money. I was heavily cross shopping other makes, if it wasnt for the free 3 year maintenance and long powertrain warranty, I would of bought into another brand

cadillac,xt5,2018,R. Booth, 07/08/2018,The most dangerous vehicle I've driven,1,"Having the Cadillac name I was expecting a quality vehicle. What I found was disappointing. During my first drive I found that the hidden shift buttons on the back of the steering wheel will shift the transmission with it set to ""Drive"" or ""Manual"". I accidentally touched the down shift side on the freeway suddenly finding myself in a much lower gear than I needed with traffic behind me making emergency moves to miss the suddenly slowing Cadillac.  That was just he first of many issues. Next was the cruise control. If you gently touch the cruise + side you accelerate 1 mile an hour per touch, like every other cruise control I've used. But with this one hit a bump as you press the button or push a little too hard it adds 5 miles an hour. With traffic around me traveling at 77+ mph and me at 76 I pushed the button to match the flow of traffic. I pushed it too hard and found myself doing 81 mph. A felony in Virginia. The next safety issue is with the windows that are another pressure sensitive issue. With a light touch the windows go up or down as you hold the button down. Press down with more pressure and the windows open completely. Not an issue my Lincoln does the same, but if you press or pull the switch up too far it also goes completely up by itself. This is a hazard for children whose fingers could be severed by the window. God forbid their head got caught in it. 
  Handling of the XT5 is ok but nothing to write home about. The Sport setting stiffens the suspension a bit and cuts down on body roll. Brakes are good. Transmission is an issue. It's an 8 speed automatic. If you live in a fairly flat area you won't mind it. Here in the Virginia mountains with back roads that wind up and down you'll notice the transmission is constantly shifting. Slow down for a corner, shifting, going up a hill, shifting. That's not only uncomfortable but really dulls the performance of the 331 hp engine. So i ended up keeping it in manual most of the time while we drove the back roads of the Shenandoah Valley.
  The vehicle is loaded with so many gadgets that it really is like driving a video games. Center touch screen OK but I don't like all the in cabin lights during night driving. But that is more my issue as I find this with most of today's cars. Being able to turn off that screen in the middle of the console would be a great plus in my opinion.
"
cadillac,xt5,2018,M. Ward, 07/10/2018,Dangerous at any speed,1,"Not what I'd expect from Cadillac. Transmission shifts constantly. Auto lights won't stop brighting people. Nearly got ticket when the car kept turning on bright lights after I dimmed them. Auto windows are a hazzard to children. Hidden shift buttons behind steering wheel can unexpectedly shift to lower gear even in Drive. That nearly caused one accident so far. Cruise control will go up 5mph if you aren't careful about how you press the switch. Radio has no tune feature so your stuck with what it wants to play.  If you have a family or live in a hilly or mountainous environment the constant shifting will drive you nuts. Save yourself the headache, buy something else.

It handles horribly and has no power. The auto stop feature only works when it wants to. The seats are soo hard and uncomfortable I feel like I'm sitting in a wooden chair. I have NO idea how GM can justify the cost of these vehicles , and YES it is a brand new car and it drives and handles worse than a Nissan Versa ( a 12k vehicle ). I used to like GM vehicles but if this is there ""top of the line "" vehicle I will never buy another one.

cadillac,xt5,2018,HandmaidenoftheLord, 02/18/2020,Beautiful Looking But UNSAFE XT5 Caddy!!!,1,"If you live in a cooler climate, forget about the floor heater in the XT5 as it is only one small hole which is directed up at your knees while your toes get frostbite, really!! Next, the heating system...There is a velocity of air trapped behind the dashboard which when the defroster is turned on, blasts of air hit you at chest and upper body, which is overwhelming! And the back-up camera is glaringly bright at night and picture is very grainy and nearly impossible to see any detail, people or animals. And the grid randomly shows up or NOT when using reverse. Fuel door has no lock or gas cap and the door is mismatched color and doesn't fit tightly in its spot, which looks chintzy cheap. Other safety concerns are the shifter in the center console as it can be easily accessed by passengers and accidentally change gears. And the manual gear shifter behind the steering wheel can easily be pulled by accident as well. On to the auto windows which can seriously cause injury or even death, wow, how did GM get away with all of these safety issues?? I loved Cadillac products from way back but now I would rather drive anything else frankly and that's a shame...get your safety act together GM and repair the Caddy's unsafe specs and restore it back to its former glory.

cadillac,xt5,2019,Stew, 06/03/2019,good car but not great car,4,"I have had my XT5 for 1 year and I am pleased with it. Rides well but sometimes suspension can be harsh. Transmission gets confused at times. I found the seat back very uncomfortable and had auto upholsterer add more padding; problem solved. Missing features like side mirror turn signal, locking gas door and many other small items. The bottom edge of the 2 front doors have sharp corners not rounded smooth edges like every other cat that I've owned. Cut my legs twice on the door. Otherwise the car is smooth, quiet, comfortable and reliable. A good car but could and should be a little better.

Follow up 1 year later - still happy with my XT5. This is my first American car I have owned and am  pleased with the reliability. The 2020 model has been updated and many of the issues I have with the car have been addressed. The new transmission is supposed to be much more refined. Many basic features missing from my car are now standard equipment (HID headlight, turn signals in mirrors, etc.).

Like most technology, you have to learn it. When you do after a day or two, you'll find the flexibility and things you can do are great. I get the feeling the reviewers get in the car and expect this knowledge to pop into their heads. It's a computer guys. Come on over to my house and I'll teach you how to use it. The mirrors are rather large and just fine contrary to this review. The base navigation system is unimpressive. The XT5 is a rather large vehicle, but I got 28mpg on a recent road trip.

cadillac,xt5,2019,Thomas Derr, 11/05/2018,Love My XT5!,5,"Three weeks ago, I took delivery of a 2019 XT5 Luxury AWD with the optional Black Ice Package (dark grey 20"" wheels, blacked-out grille, and Black ice exterior trim pieces). First, the car looks great, with the Crystal White Tricoat paint, contrasting nicely with the Black Ice Package trim. This vehicle rides so smoothly and is the quietest car I have ever driven. This past weekend, I took it on its first longer trip, from southern NJ to Northeast PA. It handled hills and twisting roads without complaint. On the way home, I filled the tank. When I got home, I pulled up the trip summary on my app, and for the last 101 miles (fill up to home), the fuel economy was calculated as 30 mpg! Even though this is an AWD model, it's not full-time AWD. On my car, AWD is activated by selecting either Sport mode or just ""AWD"". I've been driving in Tour mode, 2-wheel drive, for the most part. My XT5 also has front pedestrian braking, low speed automatic braking and lane departure warning, which my '16 SRX did not have. The Bose Surround system gives beautiful sound. I couldn't be happier with this crossover.

Back seat has lots of leg room.  Smooth ride.  After owning two Cadillac SUVs I don't think I will ever be happy with anything else!

Everything else is so intuitive and easy to use. Based on the exterior conditions the car sets the internal systems to make you comfortable. Love it!

GM has finally met the challenge of the German and Japanese luxury vehicles with interior materials, fit and finish and technology second to none.

It is just the right size to give comfort while being small enough to be able to maneuver.

The CUE electronics are horrible, however.
Why is it that some engineer decided that a sleek touch pad appearance trumped function?
I have learned, after difficulty with the touch, that the system (like an Ipad) does not respond well to fingertip touch but instead needed a finger pad touch.
Okay on an Ipad, but awkward at best while driving.
Certain things, like climate control and radio controls, just are easier with knobs. Also, voice recognition is terrible.

After I had it for a couple of months the radio began Messing up.  Wouldn’t respond to touch.  Which runs everything. I hate the design of the system. They had to replaced the system. After a year with the new system the screen cracked from the inside because it gets so hot inside the system. It is doing the same  exact thing as the last system they put in. To replace it is around $2000.00. Even if I could afford another system, I think the problem is more than a Dysfunctional system x2. Windshield wipes and hazard light turn on by themselves. Had to replace the  suspension in the front that was $1500. My back left brake light went out. Have to replace the whole light because it is LED bulbs. Dealer price $700. 
My mom bought a brand new Cadillac back in 1986. She was still driving it in the 2000’s. It was built great. No problem at all. The new ones aren’t made the same. Wouldn’t buy another one. Sad because I love the car. "

If this is how they build a luxury car I don't want to take a chance on one of their other vehicles. I Will never buy another GM product again.  There is just no quality in their cars.

inside all materials are of premium quality.
cue system was a little tough, now very user friendly, very quiet and stable ride, and i feel it has plenty of power, i don't see where you would need more performance.
it really gets up and goes, and am getting 28-30 mpg highway.
have had many new vehicles in past 5 years, and this is as good or better than any hi line import vehicle including mercedes or audi.
technology is far better than any, and the price for what it is, is a real bargain hands down.

It has been written about as the new definition of the American luxury car, and I think that that is apt.
It is not an attempt at a European or Japanese clone.
It's its own thing, and I like it a lot.
It's big enough to feel luxurious but not so big it feels clunky on the road.

The car came without wheel locks which led to my rims being stolen 3 months into my lease. On two occasions the rear suspension has dropped, literally bottomed out.  The local dealer was kind but not equipped with the training to deal this problem.  Third time, they replaced rear compressor which seems to have done the trick.  At 24,000 miles, one of the battery cables became completely corroded.  Is technology taxing the battery too much?

BUT, it was annoying!  The device that maintains the AWD needed to be replaced and the glove box door would not operate requiring FIVE trips to the dealer to fix it.  Yes, it was all under warranty, but it was annoying.  In spite of the aforementioned, I thought of trading it on on a CT6.  Nice car until the trade value is determined and the cost of a 2016 CT6 when the 2017's are about to come in and I am floored.  Cadillac is more costly than Mercedes, BMW, Audi etc for similar models and trade value for Cadillacs is in the basement.  Bought a comparable Mercedes for less with a decent trade value on my XTS.

After I contacted the dealer, and GM TAC I was told that it's operating as designed. Dealer and GM smart guys say it's the station pump pressure and the vapor bellows on the nozzle and go to other gas stations .. real nice solution!

Update: It's a nozzles issue. When I go to my local station (tested with the owner present) we noticed that two different pump nozzles resulted in two different results. A nozzle without the black rubber boot ... it clicked off .. a nozzle with the boot .. filled up fine ... since then all the nozzles have been changed at this station.... a learning experience for us both. I try to fill up only at my local station now, but those times when I have to use another and the boots not there .. it clicks off repeatedly. I try to avoid those odd named gas stations ..

cadillac,xts,2013,Michael deLeon, 10/14/2015,AMERICAN LUXURY,5,"After purchasing Toyotas for years we decided to buy American.   We are very pleased with the luxury of the XTS.  It is by far the most comfortable vehicle we have ever owned.  This is a great car for ""empty nesters"" and receives plenty of compliments wherever we take it.  We did not by the XTS for performance and although it does not have the horsepower to launch at intersections, I am pleasantly surprised at how well the XTS corners and steers.  This introductory model had a couple recalls when we first bought it as I would expect any new model would have.   Since then, the XTS has been wonderful.  The four year bumper to bumper warranty is awesome.  If you are in your middle age years and want to buy American then this vehicle is the one to buy.

The CUE system took some time to get use to since I was used to knobs and buttons on all my previous cars.  The voice recognition software works well for a truly hands free entertainment control.   Load up your SD disk and insert it into the slot and you have all the music you ever need for a road trip.  The best feature of all the electronic marvels this car has is the back up camera with motion prediction.  This is awesome in parallel parking.  Just put it in reverse, turn the steering wheel to line up your path and back into your spot.

If you want American luxury at its best, convenience, and reliability (especially with the warranty) this is the car to purchase.

I had been working through one of Cadillacs finest representatives (Mr. Chris Ferren at Crestview Cadillac), who had been working on this vehicle with me for several months, Chris was very diligent in keeping me posted on the XTS and periodically sent me supportive media to help me make my final decision. Finally, Chris actually brought the vehicle to my residence (can you believe that!) we then finished the paperwork and spent several hours going through the details of the XTS such that I could get completely familiar with all the new gadgets. Chris is an excellent person to work with and I highly recommend him to anyone that is in the market to purchase a new Cadillac, regardless of the make or model, hell definitely do a great job for you.

cadillac,xts,2013,NormV, 08/19/2015,"CUE the chorus, ""We Love Our XTS VSport Platinum!""",5,"Our Vsport had a ecu tune for over 550 lb-ft of torque. It was faster than my C5 Corvette! 

Update:  we drove 3,200 miles round trip to Key West and the XTS VSport made it a easy trip.  Set the adaptive cruise at 80 mph for almost the whole way making it a great addition for long drives.

The XTS VSport Platinum impresses everyone insight or it. It has the fuel economy on the highway(32.2 mpg, two way average for 6 hours each direction with cruise set at 65 mph), beautiful ride, but firm enough to throw it into a turn and the hydraulic steering holds the intended course. The power is phenomenal and always available when you need it. The amenities are the cherry on the cake, including the flawless CUE.

Currently working on an ecu tune close to 550 lb-ft through it's AWD. The fiancé says, ""it just goes!"".

-------

Not much new to report. A new set of 18"" wheels with set of Pilot snow tires and shutting off the stability control has a new meaning on snow covered roads.  The torque vectoring does wonders in rotating the VSport with the throttle on the white stuff. 

Over all, even with the lighter 18"" wheels, the ride is stiff. The in-laws come out of 10-15 year old Toyota's with clapped out suspensions find the ride too sporty. But they find the rear heated seats inviting when they can figure out the touch screen controls. 

I'm thinking it needs more bark to match the 550+ lbs bite. So maybe a rear muffler upgrade.

cadillac,xts,2013,Paul Huba, 02/28/2019,Likes and dislikes,5,"This is a handsome and beautifully designed car.  The ride is exceptionally controlled and comfortable.  The safety features are what all cars should have, and I'm enjoying the extra confidence they give me when I am maneuvering in tight parking spaces.  Also on the highway when I enjoy the scenery and take my eyes off the road.  I also like the heads-up display with the speed limits at a quick glance.     As a senior citizen my dislikes are that radios need not be overly designed so that stations and volumes can be adjusted by feel and not having to focus and strain to see the controls while driving, on a screen that may have some sun glare etc.  I would like the power of the engine to come on a little quicker, similar to my GMC Terrain.  It has a similar engine size.  The remote for the doors and the ignition are a little too large for a mans pocket but just right for a woman's purse.  Maybe a reduction in size or weight would help.

cadillac,xts,2014,Jerry, 12/16/2016,Think twice on this car..think again and don't buy,2,"I own a 2014 XTS, but it's the same basic car.  I started with a 2013 XTS but it was so riddled with problems that Cadillac bought it back under Lemon Law and put me in a 2014 XTS.  I haven't had the problems with the 2014 that I had with the 13, but it has it's own problems that can't be corrected like a radio that won't stay off when you turn it off.  Well about two times a year it will stay off, but it goes back to the ""stay on"" mode, and Cadillac says that's ""normal"" and there's nothing wrong.  Well then, why does it stay off every now and then.  Which version should be believed?  Next would be the ride...in a word horrible!  This car rides like an old pickup truck from the 50's.  You feel EVERY bump and dip in the road, so much for the ""Magnetic Ride Control"" that's supposed to read the road a thousand times a second to avoid the bumps and dips...it doesn't!  Also the tires pick up and transmit a loud noisy sound to the cabin...on even the best of roads.  Last would be the resale value.  My car just turned 16,000 miles and is in excellent condition, and according to Kelly Blue Book, it's worth $30,000 less than it cost in two model years.  It must be a really hard sell on the used market.  Potential buyers are smarter than I was, and they know what a disaster this car really is and avoid it.  I wish I had.

I haven't changed my feelings about this car.  As the word gets out, even fewer people are buying a Cadillac XTS.  Both Cadillac and their dealers are desperate trying  to get rid of them without much luck.  The Sales Manager at my dealership has been dogging me with never ending e mails about me trading my 14 in on a 2017 ""you'll have a new 4 year bumper to bumper warranty.""  Yeah right...just what I want, the same exact car, with the same exact horrible ride, and all it will cost is my 14 and $31,000.  Sorry, but no thanks.  I do want to say the dealer is excellent, but they didn't build this horrible car.  Add to that the new Cadillac CT6 which again is almost exactly like the XTS, but two inches longer, and get this...the base model is about $58,000 and it comes with a 4 cylinder engine...a Cadillac with a engine they borrowed from a Chevy Cruze...are they crazy??  By the time you upgrade to the proper V6 engine and trim package, you'll be at 70 some thousand dollars!  No wonder you don't see many if ant CT6's on the road.  Cadillac has lost sight of who their customers are chasing both BMW and Mercedes customers, and it  hasn't worked.  They just lose loyal customers like me forever.  Cadillac has nothing to offer me anymore so I will go in a different direction when it's time to trade.  It really is sad, but the stupid Cadillac Division Manager doesn't have a clue as to what their customers want.

Haven't changed my mind on this car.  With 21000 miles on the car, I have had the 3rd replacement battery.  The onboard computer that controls EVERYTHING is as dependable as a $25 watch.  The bumper to bumper warranty expires in January of 2018.  Will see if I can buy an extended warranty just to cover this nightmare that's always causing trouble.  When you buy a Cadillac, you will live with the Dealer's Service Department and 99% of your problems will be with the useless technology that was forced down your throat!

Well it may still be luxurious & beautiful to look at, but that is all it offers,,, just looks... The base model offers nothing one would expect with an original sticker price of close to $50K,,,, My last 4 dr sedan, Ford Taurus, 2010, is missed terribly !!!! No heated seats, no sunroof,, the control system (radio, heater & AC) is controlled through a ""CUE"" system, that is like using a I-Phone while you are driving,,, and you know what they say about using your phone while driving..... Although you can adjust these in a more traditional way,, it's not anything that is easy to do,,, finger sliding & touching is still a must to operate controls.... Only using the steering wheel controls to change radio stations is the best way to insure your safety........ If you have to pull your door shut (either side) you better have real long arms (or be un-belted) because the doors open where a person under 6ft tall will have issue reaching the handle to pull shut......

cadillac,xts,2014,paul d, 04/27/2017,what does caddy spend it's engineering budget on?,1,"Worst new car I've ever bought, and I've had at least 25. Where to start. Cue system impossible, I wonder how many drivers have died trying to turn on radio. Voice recognition non existant my lg cell phone never misses a beat but caddy has never caught on, I don't even try anymore. At 500 miles had to buy a new tire that ruptured, i must have ran over something no warranyy. At 14000 miles original tires wouldn't pass inspection, worn out, no warranty because they are performance tires. So had to pay for set of tires. I bought nokian and after 15000 more miles the nokian still look like new. Glove compartment door froze shut, dealer had to tear glove door off and replace. Side detection radar stuck on and kept side marker lights on even with car off and locked, had to replace system. Head light burnt out and informed they have to take front bumper off to replace headlight. If not under warranty that's 225.00 to just remove and replace bumper for a headlight, doesn't include parts. Latest is brakes squeal so loud people on sidewalk stop and look. Had to replace all the pads and rear rotors. Rotors were ""delaminating"". Like the tires, pads aren't part of bumper to bumper warranty, 75.00 dollars for pads. Honestly, i'm not hard on vehicles, this car just sucks. Oh, depreciation is insane, i'm losing value at the rate of 1000.00 a month. Am I down on gm, no, I have a gmc truck that's tops. So if your thinking about this caddy run like hell....
"
cadillac,xts,2014,David Wang, 10/24/2015,"Loved it at first, but fatal flaw...",4,"I recently had this car for an extended rental covering nine days and 1200 miles, so I hope my review holds some weight. 

When I first got on the road in this Cadillac, I was thoroughly impressed and thought GM has come a long way since the last time I had regular use of another GM vehicle in the late 90's. This Cadillac had good power, good braking, decent handling and road feel. The HID headlights light up everything on the road, but get used to the flashing from oncoming cars thinking you have your high beams on. The 6-speed transmission is good but is no match to an 8-speed ZF transmission.

The interior is very nicely appointed, but the infotainment/climate control is extremely cumbersome. Buttons would not register depresses or would be delayed. Adjusting the audio volume with buttons that had a delay couldn't be more annoying. The large LCD screen showed fingerprints all over and there is color banding if viewed thru polarized sunglasses. The hidden compartment behind the controls was too easily opened when inadvertently touched. The Bluetooth connection also intermittently would not play audio from an iPhone and would require an effort to disconnect and reconnect. 

Which leads me to review the worst design flaw of this vehicle: the ""smart"" key. The locking algorithm of the car allows the user to lock the key inside the car with no ability to unlock the car. I experienced this when I had the key in my hiking backpack, walked up and opened the trunk where I placed said pack and key inside the trunk and closed the trunk. Doing so, locks the trunk without alarm and does not unlock the trunk and/or doors. No other smartkey equipped car I've experienced would allow the user to do this, and I cannot believe GM engineers did not think of this all-too-common scenario. Even a 2007 Toyota Prius would unlock the cabin doors if it detects the user closing the hatch with the key inside the hatch.

Overall, this was a nice effort by GM in producing a luxury vehicle to compete with the Japanese and German manufacturers, but it still misses in the fine details that make a good car a great car.

cadillac,xts,2014,Lorrell Cooper, 08/15/2018,xts my 5th and last cadillac,3,"My family cars have all been Cadillac since 1993. I have had five of them now.. First off my 2014 XTS (bought new) is smaller and it can no longer be called a big luxury car. It might as well be a Toyota in that regard. They changed the suspension so it handled more like a sports car. To do so they sacrificed a smooth ride. It rides like a truck., You feel every bump. It is not a quiet ride. You hear the tire hum and other outside noise quite a bit. I recently rented a Ford Torus and was amazed at how much smoother the ride was and how quiet it was inside the car by comparison. You need really good eyes to be able to read most of the instruments on the dash and it distracts your concentration on the road. The voice recognition for navigation and radio/cd etc is terrible. My cell phone is considerably better. the opening to get into the car is so small (35""high) entry is difficult. You really have to double over and bend your head down to get in. I'm agile enough to do it, but my wife has a hard time.   It has a great many high tech features for convenience and safety that are really nice..........but so does everybody else.  And finally...When it was 2 years old, it had depreciated to half of it's $52000 price (before taxes etc).........4 1/2 years old with 19000 miles on it 
and the resale value is in the toilet!  (update 11/2017) Sold this Cadillac.  Bought it for $57000 out the door.....sold it for $24000...just under 5 years old = $6600 deprecation per year.

It is so quiet I accidentaly left the motor running when my wife and I went to lunch - it was still running when we returned - there is no key. It is a better value for your money than the Mercedes E Class, BMW 5 or the new 2014 Cadillac CTS Sedan. 

On April 8th 2017 - I sold my great XTS and bought an even  Greater CT 6 - the only thing wrong with the Cadillac CT 6 is that GM and Cadillac don't know how to advertise their cars like Lexus, BMW and Mercedes - if they did - the CT 6 would be blowing them all away on Sales.

cadillac,xts,2014,Bill Olinger, 07/01/2016,Still a great car!,5,"This is my fifth new Caddy since 1990 and the best so far. I sprung the extra cost for the Platinum/Twin Turbo. Besides the great power (better than my previous Northstar engines), with the Platinum you get most of the goodies included. I do not have automatic parallel parking or rear seat DVD, and did not want them either. This is the car you could drive from coast to coast in comfort. The only sedan trunk I've ever had bigger than this car was an old Mercury Marquis. The only trouble I've had is with a couple pieces of dashboard trim. Even people who aren't in to cars say it's beautiful, especially the interior (jet black with wheat inserts). Occasionally I'll experience an electronic gremlin that will (for example) shut off the lane departure system without my pressing the button. It's obvious when it happens and easy to reset. Not worth a trip to the dealer.  My wife owns a 2016 Lexus, and the electronics are much more confusing than on the Caddy. The adaptive cruise control is amazing. The brakes come to very quick stops if needed. the front end at night especially is a head turner. I've seen the new CT6 (the big new flagship, not to be confused with the smaller CTS)  in person and it's a great car, but it does not detract from my XTS owner ship. (Maybe in a few more years...!) I've logged about 29K miles so far. I read the Cadillac forums, which are mostly posts by those with gripes, but I have experienced very few of the problems I have read about. Not one serious issue yet, mostly routine maintenance and a couple of minor recalls that all cars can have. The Bose ""Centerpoint"" surround radio sounds fantastic. The ride is smooth, the car handles well, and it has more reserve power than anyone needs.  I find that Caddys (maybe GM in general) have well-calibrated gadgets (blind spot, cruise, etc.) that work well.  Our new Lexus has the same gizmos, but somehow are not ""spot on"" like those in Caddys. Big Caddys have always just ""felt right"" to me.

Addendum: car is now 5 1/2  years old and still like new. (I keep it garaged and cleaned.) Only notable issue is that batteries only last about 2 years it seems. Probably lots of heat and gizmos that drain it. Also, first two were factory batteries. Replaced now with an aftermarket that might last longer. The more I keep it the more I like the car, especially since GM looks to be phasing out large sedans from most of their lineup in favor of SUVs and trucks.

Addendum #2: Now at about 50,000. This summer I was driving in the desert for a few days where temps reached 122 degrees. The electric cooling fan ""stuck"" on and drained and ruined the battery. The dealer ""reflashed"" a computer, which stopped the fan from constantly running even after shut-off. Had to remove the fuse for a few days when parking. Eventually, the dealer replaced the fan assembly as it was just shot, probably from the extreme heat. Unfortunately, about the same time the passenger-side LED DRL assembly burned out. Headlight still worked, but it's all one sealed unit. $1600 to replace and not covered by warranty. Oh well, way cheaper than a new car! Overall still a great car and looks and runs like new!

cadillac,xts,2015,Don D, 10/15/2015,Like driving my couch!,5,"Let me start by saying I have been wary about American cars until now!  I had a Chrysler 300-S witch was good but missing a few things until I drove the XTS. The seats are great, the ride, climate controlled seats, and Bose system my drive a joy!   I would suggest the front wheel drive over the all wheel drive, really not needed and I can feel the difference with acceleration. The MPG is less then my prior 8 speed and XTS can use a slightly bigger gas tank but I'm sticking with this one for a while, coming from a guy who changes cars every 18-24 months!

cadillac,xts,2015,john kneeland, 01/05/2017,Not a CTS,4,"Overall our previous CTS may have been slightly better.  This car is not as fast but far more comfortable than the CTS Coupe (Performance). We have now purchased an XTS-V which we have enjoyed. With 410hp it's a blast to drive.  Our 2015 XTS was destroyed when hit in the rear by a truck at 65mph!  Wife was driving and sustained only minor strains........  XTS-V after 5 years on the road still runs perfectly and shines like a new dime.  Even though it drinks premium, it's worth it @ $2.59 gal. It's 2020 now.  We replaced the Cue screen unit as it failed ($1200) and heated seats failed.  Extended warranty handled both.  ALWAYS buy the extended warranty with luxury cars with all the options as sooner or later you'll need it.  We now have 48K miles on it

cadillac,xts,2015,John R. Clausen, 12/26/2015,I want my Lincoln back!,3,"Probably my last car due to my age.  I have owned many cars but not a caddy until now,, a nd I must say I'm a little disappointed.  The infotainment system can't hold a candle to my past Lincoln.  The Lincoln was also more roomy up front and had a better standard engine.  Another disappointment for me was the dash lighting.  At night it is awesome but during the daylight it darkens out and becomes almost a blank.  Is it not necessary to view your instrument panel during the day also? Car handling is great and the look of the car is great, but Ipaid for a lot of extras that don't measure up! Also the forward crash monitor and its notifier, that is the red lights that appear and the alarm don't respond until you are too close to the car ahead of to avoid an accident. I could go on but as I said when I started this,  I wish I had my Lincoln back!

cadillac,xts,2015,majesticviewrentals, 04/05/2016,Wouldn't rent again,3,"I rented this car for a week and during that week did lots of city driving in Atlanta, as well as a road trip to Charleston (5 hours each way).  From the moment I sat in the driver's seat I regretted getting the car, but it was all they had left so I was stuck with it.  The driver's seat was ridiculously uncomfortable.  You sit on a narrow panel of material and from each side of that middle panel there is a separate panel that comes up at about a 30 degree angle.  I am curvy but not overweight - you would have to be very skinny for your bum to fit on the middle panel. Within an hour, my right foot was going to sleep - no matter how many adjustments I made to the seat.  There are lots of adjustments but none to lower those side panels.  The other negative - Every time I wanted to see to my right, I had to have the passenger lean forward so I could see behind their head (and it wasn't a tall person).  It was hard to get past the discomfort of the seat to judge the rest of the car, but it was otherwise a comfortable and fairly quiet ride.  The passenger liked their seat (but is had a wider middle panel). As disclosure, my past two cars have been a 7 series BMW and an E class Mercedes, so maybe I am not being fair, but they need to make the seat adjustable!

cadillac,xts,2016,Anthony Lupino, 05/25/2016,XTS,5,"This car is the best car that I have owned. The car rides quietly, runs great and looks great. Did I say that it produced in North America not Asia. Service just down the road with plenty of GM dealers to take care of every need. The quality of the car for the cost is excellent you will not be disappointed with the xts take a look.

I've had the car for one year and it had proven to be excellent on the road in upstate New York's winter wonderland. With snows on all four wheels it will go through almost any snowy conditions.

The XTS now has 27,000 miles on it and is running very well. Only routine maintenance has been preformed on the car and it is included in the price of the car so there are no out of pocket expenses in caring for this vehicle. We have taken the XTS on several long trips to the Carolina's and it gets over 30 miles per gallon while on the freeways and it is very comfortable to drive long distances.

The xts has 37000 miles on it and was recently in for service for rear axle service. Was loaned a new Cadillac to drive during the service. Received excellent service from the dealer warranty is excellent. Oil changes are included with this car another great feature. Very happy with the vehicle and all of the features it offers.

Performance is every good, just drive one and note the fine brakes, steering and ride. The warranty is excellent and Cadillac dealers are not difficult to fined. If you can't fined a Cadillac service center there are GM dealerships everywhere. This car has a lot to love. Why buy a German car that cost twice as much?
"
cadillac,xts,2016,Zachary Jenkins, 10/26/2018,Better than the MKS I had.,4,"I traded in MKS for this vehicle and I have been rewarded with a more comfortable, more stylish and more efficient vehicle that has just been easier to live with. The engines are rated similarly, but I assume the Caddy is a lighter vehicle because the acceleration is healthier and the fuel bills smaller (The engine turns 2000 rpm @ 80mph). The MKS had an elegant interior, but it was tight for everyone. The XTS also feels like an easier transition from the imports I had always driven before owning the MKS. No one will confuse this car for a Buick, as they often did with the MKS and where the MKS did give the impression of being more expensive than it was, the Caddy is sleek and high tech-sometimes a little too much so, as I feel like I am driving the Starship Enterprise at times-the technology works and works well, but somehow the MKS seemed to have a bit more soul at times. Those things not withstanding, I couldn't possibly go back to the MKS. I've only needed servicing and maintenance-no repairs even at 125,000 miles. 10 hour drives don't beat me up anymore and I just feel better since I bought it.
At 195000 miles, nothing has changed. My only gripe would be the electronically controlled shocks/struts are $300 a piece and I cannot in good conscience tell you whether or not they actually improve the ride or handling. The car is still rock solid and anything that has needed attention was either a maintenance item such as tires, brakes and shocks or headlights and taillights. Strangely, the decorative LED strip on the passenger side has fallen victim to a leak in the headlamp housing and this must be a common issue because I see plenty of other XTS with this same malady. Otherwise, it is hard to beat this vehicle in it's overall goodness.

cadillac,xts,2016,silver, 12/08/2016,Unreliable vehicle,1,"I bought this gorgeous, classy, luxurious and very expensive 2016 Cadillac Platinum top of the line Caddy. After five months and 6000 miles it is sitting in my garage unused waiting to be traded in at a major loss. Serious maintenance problems include a complete loss of power overnight while sitting in the garage. Roadside service had problems starting it with his power pack and finally had to jump start it with an old personal truck that he used. The dealer service department could not find a fault after keeping the car overnight to trace the battery drain. A  few days later while on a local drive, the transmission failed! It would not move forward or reverse. The beautiful car sat on the side of the road until road service showed up to tow it to the dealership. The dealer determined parts were needed to repair it and it took almost a week to get it repaired. The transmission is now shifting rough but dealer test shows no fault. Being an elderly owner, I have lost all confidence in the vehicle and do not dare drive it on long trips. I am now using my wife's reliable Honda CRV for long trips. Very embarrassing to tell friends, family and neighbors why this beautiful vehicle sits in the garage unused.  Buyers must heed the below average consumer reliability ratings for Cadillac. Beware.

cadillac,xts,2016,Dennis Spinella, Ph.D.,My personal Limo!,5,"Overall, my 2016 XTS AWD Cadillac was a phenomenal purchase. It is a first class vehicle that is worth more than I paid for it. The inside is luxurious and the exterior makes the statement of pure luxury. It is a large car designed for traveling and riding, rather than a driving automobile. The XTS is not known for impeccable handling. You need to check out the CTS models if you want a sporty ride that hugs the road. This is a luxury cruiser that is quiet, comfortable, safe and has all the amenities you would need. Those that give a negative critique of the Info-tainment system have not researched the manuals. Once you experience the overall navigation system, you will find that it is a breeze...the way we felt back in the 90's about a computer. A car buyer needs to do his/her homework, for all cars are designed for particular buyers. The German automakers accentuate driving, rather than comfort and reliability. If your priority is reliability, get a Lexus or Toyota, though they are a bit ""vanilla"" in appearance. The Cadillac strikes a balance between driving and riding, and has the Cadillac name plate!

cadillac,xts,2017,Howard Clark, 12/11/2017,"Did not think I would like it, Changed my mind.",5,"Originally I wanted a CT-6, having a 2011 DTS.  I wanted my wife to sit in many sedans to find the one she preferred.  We had not considered an XTS, but owning Cadillacs since 1971 we decided to look at all models again.  Previous brands tried were BMW 7 Series, Mercedes E and S, and Lexus LS 460. I realize there is no comparison between the imports and the XTS, however, the price point on the XTS, it's finish and hi-tech components made me look closer.  Since my wife uttered the fatal words, ""I like that one"", and Edmonds had already provided me the quote we purchased the XTS.  It is a great car, reads almost as smoothly as my previous DTS's and DeVilles.  I gave road noise a poor grade on the survey, however the noise and harsh ride was totally the fault of the tires.  The original equipment tires provided great stability and drive characteristics, but I care nothing about that.  From similar complaints from other Cadillac owners about tires I requested the dealer to replace them with a different brand/non performance tires.  This was done at no charge to me, my ride is restored and we truly like the car.  The warranty and free service is equal or better than the imports.  The engine and drive train is well proven.  Nice Cadillac, Nice Pricing.

Update June 2018
been on several trips with the XTS, performed wonderfully.  Highway mileage at 73 MPH is 29.7-31.2.  The car is extremely responsive for a non-turbo V6, never any issue with lack of power for any purpose. Electronics are faultless, handling is great. I had it serviced by a out of state dealership, again very pleasant experience, no cost.  Only small con's are the trunk size is smaller than a DTS and we carry a small scooter as well as luggage in the trunk.  Perhaps it is my age or just maybe the seats could be a little softer.  Beyond that, great car for us, have honestly enjoyed it since purchase.

Huge...Sleek...powerful...refined...super comfortable..roomy...eye catching....just beautiful! We first drove the new CT5 and really liked it, but the ride was nothing compared to the xts which we drove afterwards. Got the base model in black with black interior and dark tinted windows, it looks like the top of the line model but for much less. She drives like a dream, like floating on a magic carpet...but also handles surprisingly well for such a large car. It has tons of high tech stuff that I could care less about, but it does look nice. The other thing is very few peeps have one where I live, so its something different and special as well. Ginormous interior, but drives like a smaller car....silky smooth and I get compliments everywhere I go. And since most peeps are buying suv/cuvs now, sedans have much larger rebates...the xts is no different, with the gm card...giant gm rebates and dealer discounts, I bought this beauty for less then you could buy a new bmw 320i for...the xts is much nicer, larger, more powerful...getting 30mpg on the highway as well...only downside is slightly restricted side and rear view, put a couple of those stick on convex mirrors and your good to go!

cadillac,xts,2017,George Woodruff, 04/23/2017,Beautiful car/super comfortable,5," Well, now we've had it for about 40k miles( in service April '17) with no problems and still are pleased with the purchase.  Still original tires in very good shape.  Getting upper 20s gas mileage.  We went to Lexus for our last new purchase......ES350.  It is also a good value.  The Caddy is bigger and quieter w more features and 20K more dollars.    I haven't had the Caddy very long but so far we love it.  The massaging seats are a must and the driver safety features are quite useful.  The adaptive cruise control takes some getting used to.  It adds safety.  The down side is that I approach the vehicle in front and my car slows so inconspicuously that I find myself following at the prescribed distance at 5mph slower when I don't have to.  Change lanes and you're off again to the set speed.//////After 1 1/2 yr....still love the car.  No problems.  I still like the massage feature, but the seats are not that comfortable for me.  I have an ATS also that is comfortable.  The safety features make me a better driver. I like the lane departure warning and the seat vibration if  I am too close to a vehicle or the garage wall.  The backup lights are weak.  They make you have to use the camera.  The computer interface is fine and Onstar is quite useful.

cadillac,xts,2017,Chuck W, 01/02/2018,A geezer's delight!,4,"GM apparently sells a large number of Luxury optioned XTS's to fleets. They don't have all the goodies of the Premium or Platinum Luxury editions, but they come back on the market as one year old cars dirt cheap. I considered many of them but decided we needed the extras that come with the Premium Luxury model. We were able to buy a dealer demo with only 3400 miles on it with a $20K discount. We have driven Cadillacs for 30 years but always bought used ones. This is our first new Cadillac and it is stunning. The fact that SUVs, pickup trucks, and ""sport"" sedans are so popular make this traditional luxury sedan a great buy. Ours is a 2017 model and I note there is heavy dealer discounting on 2018 models. If you want a luxury sedan at a bargain price compare the XTS with what you get can get for the same price. Love the adaptive cruise control. Haven't gotten up the nerve to try the auto parallel part feature.  Now for the not so great. The CUE touchscreen controls are hard to operate. If someone came up with an aftermarket on/off/scroll button, every owner would have it installed. On top of being anything but intuitive, the screen retains your fingerprint every time you touch it. It looks messy and at some times of the day can actually obscure the controls. The power window controls are placed too far forward. The switch for the driver's side window should be right where your hand falls, but you tend to hit the rear window button instead. This car has more road noise than previous DTS and SLS we have owned. The Goodyear Eagle tires may be part of the problem, but you would think GM would want a quiet ride in a luxury car. One year in to ownership of this car I couldn't stand the road noise any more. I was shopping for replacement tires and was very annoyed that GM would equip a luxury car with tires this obtrusive. I drove a CT6 and decided that was what I should have bought. I am much happier with the CT6 all around. The XTS is an excellent value, but it's not Cadillac's best.

cadillac,xts,2017,R. Frost, 03/11/2018,Would never buy any other car,5,"This is my first Cadillac.  Always (I'm 65 and my Pa before me) been Ford folks.  Previous car 2007 Lincoln MKZ which was a very good car until about 110,000 miles then it was all downhill on the dollar slope (lots of maintenance expense).  But the Cadillac....Ours is a lease return with 24,000 miles and was exceptionally clean.  The positives:  This car feels like I remember the big cars of yesteryear.  Not the 'ol stoneboat dip and sway mind you, but it feels like you've got Detroit steel around you in a car with an extremely comfortable and VERY QUIET ride.  This is a road car with the excellent combination of comfort and superb handling characteristics.  It isn't a sports car, but really...if I wanted a sports car I would buy one, cram myself in, fill the trunk with my shaving kit, sail around the corners, then after 2 hours struggle to unfold my stiff and sore self and gimp into the lodge.  With this XTS, I have all the dip and dive I need, drive for 8 hours, open a sensibly sized door, step out (yep..I need to stretch a little), walk into the lounge and have a cold one.  I can unload the 4 suitcases and other paraphernalia from the spacious trunk later.  The minimal cons:  The touch screen and touch bar climate/sound controls.  The climate and sound controls look nice, sleek.  But are not really drive friendly.  It is difficult to consistently get the desired results without taking eyes off the road and 'finding' the right spot to touch to make a change.  Caddy would do better with less high tech and more user friendly (read safety).  Intuitive ""I can feel the dial"" controls would be safer and less frustrating.  This is by no means a deal breaker, but it does reflect on safety.   This car offers all I want in one package,...I had begun to wonder if they ""made 'em like this anymore"".  Go Detroit!!!!!

cadillac,xts,2017,Tom, 03/12/2018,Cadillac XTS FWD,4,"Car is very stylish for a four door sedan.  Ride height is low resulting in poor visibility.  Pluses: safety features, great stereo sound except no CD, attractive interior, quiet window operation, handles like a smaller vehicle, easy to park.  Negatives: ride comfort would be excellent if it weren’t for the noisy tires (Goodyear Eagle RS-A P245-45-R19).  Owned seventeen vehicles and the tire noise is off the charts.  Perfectly quiet on new asphalt but extremely noisey on concrete or composite surfaces.  Actually sounds like you are riding on the rims on some streets.  Instrumentation on lower trims does not compare to instrumentation on much lower price vehicles.  Touch controls for radio, navigation and climate require two or three attempts just to change the volume or fan speed.  Navigation is more difficult to operate and less accurate than navigation systems on Chrysler, Nissan, Ford.  Really wanted to like this car, but didn’t research it enough.

cadillac,xts,2017,SouthernYankee, 01/29/2019,1st Caddy and happy so far.,4,"I bought my 2017 XTS while still under warranty (not CPO though) fora great price, in my opinion. Traded my Traverse for it. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the Traverse. In fact, it was actually a great vehicle in every way except for gas mileage. Which is why I decided to get rid of it ( if I was lucky I could get 17 mpg on the highway while using the cruise control). Driving a lot of highway miles as I do, this was getting expensive and unsustainable. Being 6’5” 250 lb, I also needed a car that was comfortable. I looked at many cars and it came down to the XTS, Impala LTZ, Passat, E350, and Audi A6 ( which I’d previously owned). I settled on the Caddy primarily due to road comfort, space, and maintenance costs. Sure, the model I got doesn’t have blind spot monitoring but I drove for 50 years without it before and it actually makes you be more aware of your surroundings as a driver. “Experts” talk about lack of road feel but I think the XTS is fine. Steering is effortless, it rides smooth, and it corners flat. Great for a car this size. CUE is okay. I’m sure the recent upgrades to the system has led to its improvement. Response is fast, display of is clear but a fingerprint magnet. My wife says the heated seats aren’t as good as our previous cars but that’s subjective. Interior room is great. My son is the same size as me and has plenty of room in the backseat. The best part, so far I am averaging almost 29mpg on the highway. Pretty good for a full sized with a 6 cylinder car these days. I’m hoping this car lasts for a long time.
"
cadillac,xts,2017,Matt, 11/28/2018,"Wow, what a value!",5,"I've owned my XTS for almost 3 years now and still absolutely love it! I'm not a grandpa but i did want a nice roomy car that still had an athletic feel. The overall quality of the build and features surpasses all other cars on the road in my opinion. I started with an open mind when buying my new car and spent 2 years looking at all models available. I ended up choosing between the XTS and a used S Class Mercedes. The length of my garage ultimately made my decision but I don't regret getting the Caddy at all. Handles and performs like a sports car and has 18 cuft. of trunk space! I have done a a/b comparison between the XTS and the CT6 in the showroom and I would still buy the XTS. The CT6 looks and feels like a bloated version of my car at a higher price point. I also feel that the XTS is the most beautiful Caddy since the '84 Sedan DeVille.

cadillac,xts,2017,Bruce, 04/12/2017,Cadillac's Cue System is HORRIBLE,2,"We were actually considering purchasing a new XT-5, so we decided to rent the XTS for an extended vacation that included virtually every type of driving, including city driving in Phoenix & Las Vegas, heavy mountain driving in Northern Arizona & Utah, and flat, high-speed desert driving in Nevada and Arizona. First, the pluses: overall pleasing style that offers decent interior room in a relatively compact body configuration. Fairly well-finished interior that isn't too busy in appearance. Reasonably sized trunk that will accommodate two large suitcases plus two good sized carry-on bags. Sorry, but that is where the pluses stop. Now the negatives, and there are a lot of them: Cadillac's Cue Entertainment/Info system. This is hands down the worst system I have ever used (we've had Mercedes, Volvo's, Jeep's, Ford products with My-Touch Sync, as well previous model Cadillac's, all with factory navigation systems to compare). Get your hands anywhere near the touch screen and half the screen displays control icons for the various functions the system offers...this is INCREDIBLY annoying, especially when you are using the sometimes accurate navigation screen. Our car was 3 weeks young and had just 1,000+ miles on it when we got in it, so one would assume that everything should be in proper working order. The navigation system occasionally worked well, but on at least three occasions over the 1,600 mile, nearly two-week ""test drive"" we gave this car, it changed turn-by-turn directions while we were driving it. Voice control worked well about half of the time, with the other half being so bad that it was actually comical. If I didn't know that it was giving us bogus instructions, we would have ended up in Canada instead of Las Vegas. Once, the voice told us to proceed 2.6 miles and then take a right, but the route shown on the screen indicated a left turn only 100 feet ahead...TOTAL junk! Cooled seats: first car I have ever driven where the cooled seats turned on by themselves when the car was not started remotely on a hot day; very bizarre. Climate Control: Set at 72 degrees on auto-temp with an outside temperature of only 78, the thing blasted cold air for hours at a clip; heat sensor must be mounted in the top of the dash where the sun is always on it. Cruise Control: Lot's of luck figuring this one out. Hit the resume switch and it might go back to the previous speed, or it might choose a higher speed in 5-mph increments. One time, it was set at 82 mph, and when I hit the resume, it took-off and showed it was set for 90! During mountain freeway driving, the cruise is incapable of maintaining a steady speed. Shifting: car automatically downshifts on steep mountain grades, even at freeway speeds. Suddenly the tachometer will go from 1,200 RPM to over 4,000 RPM in an effort to slow the car down even when the driver isn't using cruise control or the brakes. This is extremely annoying and completely unnecessary.  Interior storage: no place for sun-glasses, cup holders are not cooled like some competitors, making water bottles rather warm while driving in the desert. Absolutely stupid compartment hidden behind climate & radio controls that is activated by touching the bottom edge, engaging an electrical motor that swings the entire panel upward, providing nothing is obstructing it...a good conversation piece that serves no purpose. Perimeter sonar sensors: Audible about two milliseconds before impact requiring driver to rely only on the visual indicators...great when in reverse! Rear camera: Rendered totally useless at night because of the glare from the center mounted back-up lamp. Sun Glare: dash appearance strips cast a glare on the side glass that inhibits the vision of the driver's side rear-view mirror. Power Adjustable Steering Wheel: Not enough vertical movement; stays too high in the lowest position adding to arm fatigue on long
 drives with hands at the proper 10 o'clock/2 o'clock position. Head Restraint Adjustment: Only up & down...really?? On a $60K automobile?? Okay, mercifully, I'm going to stop here. If you are still considering this over-priced, under-engineered, horrible excuse for a luxury car, then have at it. We've owned new Cadillac's in the past, and they have been less than stellar. Hoping that General Motors had finally shed some of the deadwood executives that drove it into bankruptcy, we decided to give Cadillac a chance at winning us over again...Not going to happen! I would guess that the biggest market for this car is the rental car fleet at heavily discounted prices, because this car just doesn't cut it.

cadillac,xts,2017,R. Harrell, 12/12/2017,Luv...Luv.... Luv,5,"I bought the XTS Premium model and luv it. I have had Mercedes, BMW and Jaguer and have fallen in luv with Cadillac. The ride, amenities and over all experience has been exceptional. I bough the car after I had bought the XT5 the week prior to replace my Mercedes GL350 and when I was looking at the SUV I decided to test drive the XTS as well. I could not get it out of my mind so went back a week later and bought it as well. I looked at the CTS6 as well but really liked the esthetics and the performance of the XTS much better. I had a CTS- V for a number of years but I can honestly say this XTS is the bomb diggity, Luxury , ride and amenities can not be beat. Years ago you could not get me to buy an American car but I am completely sold.

cadillac,xts,2017,Chris, 01/15/2017,What happened to Cadillac?,2,"I rented this vehicle for 12 days in San Diego over the holidays.  In spite of reading the manual twice and calling Onstar (they were no help), I could not figure out even the most basic commands like getting the seat memories to stick or getting the trip meter to appear on the display.  Even more infuriating: most of the time when exiting the car, the driver's seat would move back and the outside mirrors would point towards the ground.  While I appreciate the car's attempt to ease egress and spot puddles, the problem is the seat and mirrors would not return to their previous position when getting back in the car!  It's really aggravating having to reset these items every time you go somewhere.  My opinion is CUE is a disaster.  It was easy pairing my phone, however.  Additionally, the XTS now has rubberband 19 tires that ride like crap!  I could feel every little imperfection on San Diego's crappy side streets.  On the plus side, the car's handling was quite good.  The XTS is  a blast to throw around corners, although I miss the sound of a V8 and the car could definitely use 50 more lbs. feet of torque.  Overall, I dropped this car off thinking Cadillac doesn't know what the cars mission is and who their customers are.   I do know I could never spend $55K on a car who's controls can't be figured out, with a ride that my Ram 1500 puts to shame!

cadillac,xts,2017,Julia Fleming, 10/21/2018,2017 cadillac XTS,4,"I Love my car. I have owned the vehicle for 3 months. It was certified used when purchased with 23k miles. The interior is gorgeous. The jewel like rear view mirror charmed me first, but the seats and technology package were unexpectedly attractive. The touchscreen and touch sound control does away with buttons so the dash is clean and lean. The ere are little cubbies enough for sunglasses, change and Samsung smartphone (unfortunately not iphoneX) fit snugly  inside the conveniently secretive cubby.  It doesn’t have quite the agility of my former BMW 325i, but it does comes close, and for a sedan, that’s, well, amazing. Gas mileage is what I expected, approximately 21-22 mpg,  about the same as another former midsized sedan, a Lincoln MKS. The ride is quiet and smooth and there is adequate trunk space. Overall, it is a very comfortable car with just the right amount of luxury.

cadillac,xts,2017,Lonesome Dave, 04/15/2019,Coolest Old-Fartmobile Around,5,"I bought mine a year ago, a used fleet car with 27,000 miles. I have read some complaints about the CUE system and other controls, but I have had no problems figuring it out. I got the stock engine, but this beauty was built for comfort, not for speed. I've never had a car like this; there is not a single knob on the dashboard, which is very cool. Sure, you have to look for the button you want, but this should not take more than one second. 

I plan on driving this car when I move cross country with a German Shepherd and a parrot, and we will all be very comfortable. I agree that the stock tires are too low-quality for a vehicle of this caliber, but that's easy to fix. There are a lot of nice touches inside; one of my favorites is the ambient lighting at night. I also bought some cool accessories like floor mats with the shield emblem, and lights that display the Cadillac logo on the ground when the door is opened. 

I am a 60 year old retired computer programmer and if this is my midlife crisis, at least I'm doing it in style. The biggest shame is that Cadillac is discontinuing all sedans, abandoning the very thing that made the brand great.

cadillac,xts,2018,Stacy S, 10/11/2019,Repeated problems,3,"The Cadillac Cue system does not function properly and apparently cannot be fixed. The Cue system in this car is a second generation - I had a Cadillac XT5 previously and that Cue system utterly failed  (and was  known to be defective -read  the message boards).   On my 2018 XTS, all of my saved ""favorite"" channels continually disappear.  The steering wheel controls will not operate to change channels because the channels are gone, though you can see a darkened outline of the them on the screen.    I have rebooted, saved, and resaved channels only to have them drop off again almost immediately.    I have addressed the issue with the dealer who advises this is a known software issue and the engineers are ""working on it.""  That was months ago and I can only assume the engineers find this problem to be beneath their dignity as there is no fix in sight (I called Cadillac two weeks ago and got the same story, they are ""working on it."")  Most likely the engineers have turned their attention to developing a fleet of electric cars that no one wants or needs.  I would suggest that if they are unable to fix a software problem in an entertainment center, this bodes ill for their ability to manufacture a reliable and safe electric car (that no one wants or needs).  A second recurring problem:   the passenger side air bag seat sensor continually malfunctions.  an alarm starts sounding while driving when there is no passenger in the car.  I had to order a new sensor which by the way took WEEKS to come in.  So, for a so-called  ""luxury"" vehicle, this one falls short.  Disappointing

The CUE system is junk, the backup camera works some days and not others, the backup guides keep disappearing or the screen goes blank, the Apple CarPlay works sometimes.  It will be working, I'll stop for gas and when I restart the car it will no longer work..This happens frequently.  The memory seats only work half of the time, and there's no rhyme or reason on when and why they don't work.  at the 2 year mark the CUE screen spider-cracked...This is a known issue that Cadillac refuses to fix.  They offer to replace it for $1000-1500.  There are several lawsuits for this issue.  There is a $120 DIY fix, but Cadillac will not do anything.  The CUE system also freezes or goes completely blank on occasion.  The service department has had to do two hard resets on the system to get it back to working order.

For handling, ride comfort, and braking, ATS beats the others. Yeah, M3 is quicker by .7 sec to 60 ... not a big deal unless you take your ride to the track every weekend.
Mileage: 19mpg city, 29 highway(!), 24 combined so no complaints there especially as compared to M3. This car is a pleasure to drive with its great handling, and it feels good to have finally cut the cord to those overpriced Germans. CUE is not perfect but is far from a deal-breaker.

CUE, like your first smart phone or new computer operating system, needs understanding. However, it's appalling to see Consumer Reports slam ATS's rating because of CUE--shame on them. The ATS is fun to drive, the sound system is outstanding, cabin noise is non-existent and it handles like a dream--better than a 3 series.

A small trunk, tight rear seat and stiff ride are justified minor complaints. "

After reading several reviews of the ATS, I decided that a test drive wouldn't hurt, my expectations not being high, I was pleasantly surprised, and, frankly, somewhat stunned

I've been reading for the past 30 years in Car & Driver and Motor Trend about how great the driving experience of the BMW 3-Series was. During all of that time I was hoping like crazy that either Cadillac or Lincoln would develop and produce a direct competitor to the German entry level sport sedans. Lincoln hasn't yet, Cadillac finally did. Kudos to GM for not dropping the development of this model during their bankruptcy. The ATS's handling and steering feedback is just amazing. The ride is what you SHOULD expect from a compact sport sedan. Hey, it's not your Grandpa's land yacht!!!"

I traded in my 2012 Audi A4 Prestige S-Line for my ATS and could not be happier.
The A4 was a great car (with a few problems), but the ATS is just so much more willing to get thrown around and feels so much livelier and nimble.
The 3.6L has plenty of grunt and thus far with about 3k miles, I am averaging almost 24mpg in mixed 50/50 driving, which is just under the what my Audi got but the ATS does not need premium fuel.
The interior is top notch and CUE has been easy to figure out.
So far I have had 0 issues.
I was a little concerned giving Cadillac a try, but I am so glad I did!"
cadillac,ats,2013,David H. in the Valley of the Sun., 05/03/2018,Five years old and not a darned thing wrong yet!,5,"Bought it used with 18,000 miles (lease return) three years ago. It now has 55,000+ miles on it.  So far this car has been absolutely perfect. The interior is still flawless. I had some softer taller and fatter Michelin tires installed on the stock 17"" rims and it glides so much smoother now than with the original lower profile tires on it.  It doesn't get the highest fuel economy but then again it's not a Prius... and it's All Wheel Drive.  My guess is that the mileage is negatively affected from me wanting to put my foot into the 272 HP turbo charged power plant.  Keep in mind our other car is a Mercedes-Benz R Class with a diesel engine. So when I get in this I just can't help but put my foot down.  

Everyone who has driven this car says it drives like a sports car (not a Cadillac Sedan).  What more can you ask for... Cadillac styling with ample performance and decent fuel mileage.  I'll probably keep it for a long time.  By the way, the CUE entertainment system will drive you batty at first. But eventually you'll get it figured out. I suggest you use the controls in the steering wheel as much as possible. Otherwise you'll find that you can get distracted fiddling with them.  My only complaint is the CUE system.  The sound system is great but using the CUE instrumentation on the dash truly sucks.  

Update: 11/9/18 - I recently took it into the dealer for a recall (computer update on power steering).  I asked them to give it a complete inspection to see what maintenance might be looming.  I was prepared to have to replace the brakes soon. He said they show no wear and overall everything still looks new.  Wow! 
Original brakes with almost 60,000 and they tell me they look new?  I think that says that GM is using quality brake pads.  The only thing he found was a strut with a very slight leak.  Still no repairs. The only money spent so far has been on wiper blades and tires.

Update 11/14/2019 - Well... here I am again to tell you just what a great car this has been for us.  Not one thing to report over the past year except that we get in it and drive it and it's never once failed or needed repairs.  Can this be a fluke?  I've never had a car that was seven years old that hasn't ever needed anything fixed.  And that strut we were told was leaking hasn't dripped anything on my garage floor ever.  I took it to a local Big-O tire store to get it replaced and they said they can't find any leaks.  So not sure what was up at the dealer.  I suspect maybe someone dripped oil while filling it when they did the oil change?   

I truly love this car (except for the CUE dash controls... they still are so distracting to use).  If you find one of these for a good deal I feel secure in saying I wouldn't hesitate buying it.  Not after knowing how great ours has been.

cadillac,ats,2013,ls8, 10/20/2013,remarkable car,5,"Have the 2.0T with CUE, etc.
Have been driving it in the city and have been very impressed, but drove it for first time in N Ga mtns this weekend and was amazed.
Rather than fighting tight curves, it dives into them.
Scary fast acceleration to pass with no lag or hesitation.
Easy to pass someone on a two lane and look down and see that you are doing 100 all within a couple of seconds.
CUE took about one day to get used to and now I wouldnt want to go back.
Interior makes my previous BMW interior look like the 80's.
 Functionality and sound quality on the CUE stereo is outstanding."
cadillac,ats,2013,jg0712, 05/18/2013,"Finally, an American Sports Sedan!",4,"Have only had my ATS for a week but I can already record some observations.
This car probably possesses the best driving dynamics in a sports sedan in it's class.
Tighter suspension and lateral balance than current 3 series.
Not as smooth as Infiniti G but outshines these cars in more categories than not.

My first American car since my first car ever back in 1984 and I feel it was worth the wait.

Not perfect, but a true drivers car that doesn't compromise on handling, performance and style."
cadillac,ats,2013,Jaime H, 03/12/2016,Great entry luxury sedan,5,"I am definitely on board with the Cadillac brand after this purchase. I have had the car for almost four months and loving every second of it. This car handles surprising well, even in rain I dont have to change the way I drive. Interior is great for the price tag. I can't say anything about the cue system, as mine does not have it, but I just connect my iPod to the USB port and leave it. So getting the touchscreen didn't appeal to me. The 2.0t engine is great. Having almost no turbo lag is great for hooning around backstreets. Transmission sometimes gets confused on when to shift when pushing the car hard, but manual shift gets rid of that. 
If your in the market for a4s or BMW 3 series but are slightly to expensive,this car used is a great choice and beats out the europeans cars if you ask me.
"
cadillac,ats,2013,tomfoolery2, 03/05/2014,Flat out best value in this segment,5,"I was hesitant to check out the American manufacturers and disappointed in Lincoln for sure (Chrystler doesn't even compete here). However, this car stood out as a giant slayer.

I did exhaustive research and the ATS gives much more value per dollar than anything else out there. The equivalent German or Japanese cars cost significantly more. We're talking 20-30% more!

At first I wanted to use my new gem sparingly but the more I drive it the more I find myself making excuses to go for a spin.

Don't buy this car without the full CUE. Pony up and you won't regret it. Don't believe anyone who says CUE is unusable. I have had zero trouble.

Update: 6 years and 65,000+ miles later and I still love the car. If I had to do it again I would go for the V6. I miss the torque. The car has still been stone cold reliable and Cadillac service is stellar. My only remaining curiosity will be the long term reliability. With 4 years 50,000 miles maintenance included and 6 year 70,000 mile power train warranty it might be a long time before you see that update!

And yes, I'm dying to upgrade to the ATS-V or CTS-V.

cadillac,ats,2013,cjackson4, 03/05/2013,THE RIGHT DIRECTION,4,"Ive never seen myself as a Cadillac owner, but I must say I love this car. When I first looked into buying a new car, I compared it to the BMW, Mercedes and Audi. I wanted to get the most for my buck. After calculating price of car, maintenance, and fuel cost I easily ruled out Mercedes and Audi. The BMW drove very nice but the inside look was not appealing enough. Also, with gas prices going up I dont think it is wise to buy a car that requires PREMIUM gas. All this made my decision very easy. In the ATS I purchased the 2.5 4-cylinder. I am averaging around 25 mpg and most of my commute is in the city. I LOVE THIS CAR and I am truly happy I made this decision. "

No, it's not the 2.0T or 3.6, but this little engine really is peppy once you step on the accelerator. The only complaint is that I never achieve the marketed MPG, I only get around 18 driving to and from work and school. Other than that, I LOVE this car!"

cadillac,ats,2013,Kris, 03/08/2017,Issues with ATS Local GM service excellent,4,"I have owned my 2013 Cadillac ATS less than two months, yet have had a couple of issues with the car.  With that being said,  I have never received better service than my local GM service department has shown me.   The history of the car was a one owner (3 year lease) 32,000 miles.  The day I purchased the car and drove it home I smelled burning oil.   Noticed the next day there was oil on my garage floor.  I took to a GM service center, and they found the positive crankcase vent tube broken, replaced broken parts and installed two valves, yet after this was done there was oil dripping onto my garage floor.   Took to another GM service department closer to my home and they found oil leaking from the lower oil pan.  They resealed the oil pan and fixed the oil issue.  Two weeks later the car started shuttering when I accelerated between 25 to 40 miles per hour.  Took to my local GM service center, diagnosed issue as a torque converter chatter.   The service center replaced the torque converter.  The technician found a coolant leak while this work was being done and replaced the hose leaking.   All the work was covered under the existing bumper to bumper warranty.  My local GM dealership was awesome.  Their entire service department is a class act.  They went above and beyond to fix the issues with my car.
**Update 6 months later....  No other issues with the car.  The work (repair and replacements) the local GM dealership completed on my car fixed all issues.  It's a fun car to drive, I have lots of compliments on this car.

cadillac,ats,2013,Elaine Mico, 11/05/2015,The American Standard of Luxury not here.,1,"I leased a 2013 Cadillac ATS 4 door Sedan turbo, The car has been nothing but problems from the start.
We are talking about the American standard for luxury vehicles, obviously this car is not.
I am not going to completely trash the car because it does have some good points such as the handling, acceleration,
interior looks as well as an appealing exterior, definitely a great looking vehicle.
But the CUE system is inoperable while driving for fear of getting too distracted or frustrated and getting into an 
accident. The radio is useless it's always acquiring the HD signal so it sounds terrible, every once in a while it loses 
all the pre-set stations.

I had front end problems since the begining of my lease, the car is in the shop every few months for different problems, 
already had about 7 recalls, There is absolutely no pleasure in driving this car.
As I write this it is in the shop for noise vibrations on engine and rear. They called me and told me that there were 
loose screws on engine/door as far as the back vibration is concerned they said that all 4 rims are bent due to the 
potholes on roads. Now this definitely doesn't sound right, I can understand one rim possibly getting bent/damaged but not 
all four of them this leads me to believe that there is an apparent design/structural fault or that the materials used are 
too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. I have owned/leased well over 15 different vehicles during my life and 
never had a problem where I was told that the rims were bent/damaged.

This ATS has been nothing but headaches since we got it and I must say that the dealership has been no help.
When I last contacted the owner of the dealership he told me that I should call Cadillac/GMC directly and complain to them 
so let me get this straight you buy the car and after that they are done with you so now when you have a complaint or 
problem you have to contact the manufacturer yourself. What is the point in buying from a dealership when they are not 
there to help you, we may as well be allowed to buy directly from the manufacturer since ultimately they are the ones that 
you have to deal with.

Lastly I must say that my experience with this vehicle has been nothing but frustrating and overall unpleasant, what is 
the point of having a car that you have absolutely no joy or pleasure in driving. I would be willing to possibly 
understand having so many problems if the car was used but for a brand new car it does not appear to be reasonable and at 
this point the car only has 27,000 miles practically still pretty new.
It’s 2018 and my review of the ats still stands.
I have since leased a 2016 srx no problems, now leasing 2018 xt5 no problem.

cadillac,ats,2013,Brian Armstrong, 08/15/2015,2.0T 6A after 20K miles bought CPO at 8K miles,4,"I bought the ATS 2.0T as a CPO from a local dealer. I paid 25K and I love the car. I always put in 92+ octane and have never gotten less than 25 mpg (miles driven/gallons pumped at empty- not cue's take on the same). The handling of this car is as car&driver and all other magazines have stated - Second to none in it's class. You feel connected to the road in a car that isn't a bloated overweight numb steering overpriced import. The trans does need work however, but in sport mode I have only minor complaints. I also have had zero problems since I bought it, and I now have 20K miles. Bottom line - If you're looking for a GREAT chassis, with sweet steering feel and acceleration take a test drive. I cross tested Audi A4, 3 series all the usual and the caddy fit my needs and likes much better than the others.
"
cadillac,ats,2013,Steve M., 03/30/2016,This thing is a blast to drive,4,"The ATS is really a fun to drive car. With the 321 hp  V6 it has plenty of power and with the trans in manual mode you can really wind it up through the gears. Handling is great, it really holds the road. I don't know why it is that GM puts summer only tires on vehicles  it sells in the north east. I had to replace them not long after I got it with all season, an extra expense. The one thing that I don't like about the car is the touch screen controls. You can't work the radio or climate controls by feel, you have to take your eyes off the road to make sure you hit the touch screen just right and sometimes that isn't easy. Over all I like the car and am enjoying it but I would say that it is not anything for a little old lady or anyone wanting a real cushy ride.

cadillac,ats,2013,kd1007, 02/08/2013,ATS MAJOR PROBLEMS READ THIS !,2,"If unresponsiveness in Cadillac's CUE infotainment system has been a personal point of frustration, relief is on the way: an update to smooth things over is being worked on. CUE Design Manager Jeff Massimilla told Wired Magazine that the firm's received feedback regarding responsiveness, and they're working on ""a modification that will be released sometime later this year."" DONT BUY OR LEASE TILL ITS FIXED ! 

With the upgrade, the infotainment system will be more responsive and the touchscreen and capacitive buttons will provide haptic feedback more quickly. The Cadillac XTS and ATS are set to score the update, but there's still no exact date penciled in for the patch's arrival. 
DONT BUY OR LEASE TILL ITS FIXED ! 

Though vehicles could suck down the update with a built-in data connection, the software will need to be installed by a Cadillac dealership instead. Not a fan of having lost knobs and dials to a touchscreen in the first place? 
According to Cadillac VP of Marketing Don Butler, we'll see the likes of such analog controls complement the screen interface in the future.

I can't believe that Cadillac is not aware or able to fix this flaw with the rough idle .This Cadillac Ats will not compete with Bmw , Audi with this problem. I think vehicle has awesome styling and does have a quiet ride but the trembling on idle give the whole car a bitter taste."
cadillac,ats,2013,Greg Meyer, 10/12/2017,Not as great as you might think,3,"I have only 38k miles. My camshaft sensor went out in July of 2017, it took the shop two days to replace it and they never called me to say that they needed to keep my car another day. The techs at Putnam Cadillac don't like to talk to customers so they don't call them to inform them of pending repairs. A month after it was in the shop my Cue touch screen started dying and in two weeks was dead. I told them the Cue screen was dead when I dropped the car off yesterday. Today they finally called me after I called them for info. They said the Cue screen was dead, I said I knew that and had told them that yesterday. What's happening with it? The rep, Leo Yi, said he has the parts but he can't do anything until he speaks to his warranty administrator and she does not get in until tomorrow. Does that mean that every warranty job at Putnam Cadillac in Burlingame has to wait for this administrator to confirm the work can be done? Every job in the place must be backed up!                   The ATS is a fast car. The transmission is very slow to shift even in sport mode. The 3rd to 4th gear shift takes forever and often slips. This is common with most ATS's. It is Very small inside. If you are taller than 5'10"", don't buy one. You will have a hard time getting into it. The very tiny trunk is only big enough for a gym bag or two. The CUE touchscreen system is terrible. Due to that particular issue, I cannot recommend this car. The touchscreen works sometimes and fails sometimes. You cannot turn on the A/C without the touchscreen. If you look at the Cadillac forums, you will see the frozen or dead Cue Touchscreen is a very very common problem.  Why they are not recalling the cars is beyond me. Consumer Reports needs to look into it.  It is nice looking car inside and out. Good paint. It handles well. But the poor touchscreen, poor dealer service, and getting in and out of the car without banging my head are reasons I would never own another.

Several recalls including rear defogger, transmission issues, etc. Of course there is no recall on the CUE.  Interior falling apart. Plastic parts just pop off. I'm collecting them for next owner. Driver seatbelt gets stuck.  The audio is horrible while using the phone via Bluetooth.  I'd rather hold my phone and drive.  Navigation is only available through OnStar and limited at that. Climate controls have a mind of their own.  While only using the AC, the heater will intermittently come on; even in 100 degree temperatures outside.

cadillac,ats,2013,Adam S, 04/30/2018,You don't know what you are missing.,5,"Before owning the ATS, I had two BMWs (both bought new,) a 2002 325i and a 2005 Z4.  When I traded in my 325i in 2013, didn't want another BMW, but I did want a rear wheel drive car that would give me a ride similar to the BMW.  Well, truth be told,  when compared to my 325 and the newer BMW 3-series cars, I found the ATS' steering, road holding capabilities, road comfort, dashboard panel and interior to be superior.  This car took turns without leaning, and considering its great suspension, it rarely felt ""jittery"" on regular roads.  It's 2L turbo was quick enough for me.  However, I must say that although the BMW's turbo engine and transmission were smoother, the ATS was still a more enjoyable car to toss around.  The car's touch screen infotainment system got a lot of bad raps, but I didn't have any problems with it.  Nonetheless, it does appear that over the years, the negative reviews of the infotainment system seems to have had precedent over the car's excellent road performance and has undeservedly decreased the car's resale value.  Good new for those who are looking at the ATS (but bad for me when I will sell the car in another 2-3 years).  My overall recommendation to anyone interested in this car is not to waste any time and just buy it.  You'll have a great car at a very great price.

The CUE system is easily figured out and the My Cadillac app works great for starting car from my desk and downloading routes for upcoming trips.  Overall I am very impressed with my new baby.

cadillac,ats,2013,Jeremy, 01/23/2019,Younger male who gave Cadillac/GM a go for it,4,"So this my 3 car I have ever owned. I am an avid MotorTrend reader... previous car 1995 Mazda Porters (family car), first purchased car 2002 Volkswagen Jetta 1.8T sweet car, upgrades to a 2008 Nissan 350Z (great deal and just had to own one in my lifetime. Okay on to the Caddy just like most of us Americans we are so into our europena and Asian car brands. I know I didn’t want a 3 series as most folks say after the first year definitely 2nd you have issues. Okay on to the ATS the 2013 is the first year for this model. I think cadillac made the back a little to tight but the front seats are amazing and the leg room. I do think the leatherette material needs to be a little tougher.. unfortunately mine is tearing but in honesty the car is 6 years old now and I have owned it for 2.5 years and I drive daily. I must say the keyless entry should have been standard on all trim levels in my opinion but there is an upgrade FYI if u want to add those handles. My gas consumption is great based on current market 20-25 fills it up for me ... and I use 87 but highway I use premium fuel: the trunk space I don’t like and think they should have figured out something a little more user space friendly lol... I have had to change my lightbulb and boy it was a task but anyone can do it and save on funds. The ATS definitely introduced new Cadillac owners and the new CTS is amazing looking .. I call it ATS on steroids as it looks just like it ..  I def want to keep the car for another2.5 years and then try another brand but this was a great value and great entry level luxury sports sedan.. more tech should have been in the car in my opinion also standard .... car is quick and if u get the right engine airfilter u can hear the turbo

cadillac,ats,2013,Cat Ruggiero, 10/03/2019,TOUCH SCREEN and MORE,1,"I purchased my 2013 Cadillac in 2015 from Hudson Cadillac in Poughkeepsie, NY.  I was NEVER warned about the touch screen computer, that can STOP WORKING.  I cannot control the radio or the temperature neither on the steering wheel or the touch screen.  Cadillac has agreed to replace it and ONLY charge me for the labor.  If they didn't do that the part would cost me about 1600.00.  I have spoken to MANY people that have the ATS to see what their feedback is.  MOST said they would never buy another Cadillac.  Just the fact that they only warranty the car to 36000 miles is a clear indicator of the reliability of this car.  Oh, forgot to mention, the car comes without a spare tire.  I WILL NEVER buy another Cadillac again.  I will go back to Infinity!! A much more reliable car with a warranty of 100,000 miles.  Jeez....even Kia stands by their cars with a 100,000 mile warranty.  And my car only has 47,000 miles on it.  I keep thinking what is going to go wrong next!!  Issues with the sunroof not closing too!!"
cadillac,ats,2014,Asiafish, 01/23/2016,Leftover 2014 a ragingg bargain,3,"This is my first Cadillac after over a decade driving Mercedes-Benz C class.  I drive on average 40,000 miles per year and typically buy a new car every other year (leasing is too expensive for that many miles).  Compared to my last Mercedes (2012 C250 Sport) the ATS is more powerful, better handling and has better seats, at least in front.  With the amount of miles I drive, a comfortable drivers seat is the first thing I look at, and the ATS seat is the best I've had yet with the possible exception of the 2005 C230 Sport sedan, which wasn't as adjustable, but was perhaps a slight bit better shaped, especially at the headrest.  

<P>

The seat is extremely firm and very well bolstered.  It also has an extendable thi support that really makes the difference (I extend mine outward one detent (it has three).  The side bolsters and lumbar are inflatable and a lot smoother and better shaped than those in more recent C Class seats, though the 2005 again was just as good or better, though non adjustable for the side bolsters.

<P>

Ride matches the seats, very firm, but compliant.  I prefer a stiff ride so long as it isn't punishing, and Cadillac has about the best balance in this car of anything I've ever owned.  Recent Mercedes C Class is a bit smoother, but the ATS has sharper handling and steering.

<P>

Brakes are outstanding, with Brembo by Cadillac branded brakes up front and smaller disc brakes in the rear.  I took a very twisty mountain road Thursday night and drove quite aggressively, but the brakes never faded, never squealed and always scrubbed off speed with serious authority.  These brakes are far better than anything on any car I've ever owned, and equal to those on my friend's Porsche Cayman.  

<P>

The interior styling is just beautiful.  It has many traditional Cadillac styling cues with the slender vertical tail lights especially appealing, but everything is tidy, compact and modern.  This is a Cadillac, but a youthful, enthusiast Cadillac.  I love the way this car looks inside and out.

<P>

The CUE system is perhaps my only complaint.  This system is totally touch-screen based which is very nice, pretty and functional, so long as the car is parked or you are in the passenger seat.  It is awkward to use while driving, but fortunately most functions can be accessed by the steering wheel controls and the phone's mute button also works to mute the stereo.  I liked the Comand System in the Mercedes better, but once you spend a bit of time and learn the steering wheel controls and voice activated access the system is less annoying, though still not ideal.  I would much prefer old fashioned knobs and buttons, but it isn't a deal breaker.

<P>

The instruments are okay, nothing incredible.  There is a three-section LCD at the bottom that is extremely useful, with each of the three sections configurable for anything from trip computer to navigation, fuel economy or diagnostics.  The only real complaint I have is that the tachometer is pushed to the far left, and in aggressive driving can be obscured by the steering wheel or drivers hands.  This would be a bigger problem in a manual transmission car, but on my automatic it isn't too bad.

<P>

The back seat is small, quite a bit tighter than my last C Class.  I'm 5'9"" and like to sit a bit further back than normal for my height when driving.  I can still fit in the backseat behind my driving position, but foot and knee room is minimal.  I could ride back there for an hour or three, but a longer trip wouldn't be comfortable.  The backseat itself is terrific though, with great lower back and thigh support and the same firm padding as the front seats.

<P>

The interior is also very well trimmed in very nice leather, thick carpeting and real metal (aluminum in my car), wood or carbon fiber.  Panel gaps are even and everything feels very well put together.  The window sticker
 advertises a hand cut and sewn interior, and I believe it, with quality at least equal to my last 2012 Mercedes and better than the 2009 or 2005 that I owned previously, or my wife's Lexus for that matter.

<P>

Fuel economy is a bit disappointing so far.  I've put just over 1,000 miles on the car in the week I've owned it and my last long drive (270 miles) returned 27 MPG.  It was mostly highway driving at 80 to 85 MPH, but the C250 would return 30MPG on that same drive.  Maybe it I'll improve as the car breaks in.  City driving so far gives me just under 20MPG, where the C250 woud give 23.  This car has only a 6 speed automatic compared to Mercedes' 7 speed, plus the car has a good 70 more horsepower, so I can't complain.

<P>

It's early days yet with the ATS, but so far, I'm impressed.

<P>

***UPDATE 18 months and 46,000 miles***

My mileage is far lower than usual for this much time, which is on account of the car spending a lot of time with the dealer.  Currently in Lemon Law case.

cadillac,ats,2014,vroom2, 03/23/2014,"Update after 5,000 miles",4,"I previously posted my initial impressions of the ATS and here are some thoughts after another 5K miles on the odometer:

Now that the engine has some miles on it, the fuel economy has improved to meeting or exceeding EPA numbers. Expect 30-33 MPG on the highway and 20-22 in town.

This car needs premium gas. Lower grades will dull performance and increase fuel consumption considerably.

I still miss real buttons and knobs on the CUE system but its no reason not to buy the car.

The small 10cu feet trunk is enough for a road trip for two but no more than that."
cadillac,ats,2014,kanger3, 05/04/2015,Going back to Lexus...,3,"The sharp exterior styling brought me to this car, and the great salesman got me to drive off with it. I've had this car for 12months (16K miles) now and have run into one issue after another...A blowout from the run-flat tires was the first issue. I paid $400 for a new tire because they said it was road-hazard. Then the USB ports stopped charging. Then the car threw up a check engine light (code P0023) dealer replaced a fuel solenoid. One month later, threw up another check engine (code P0021) dealer replaced fuel solenoid in Bank B. It's been a week, and now the car is idling rough and lacking power. No engine codes...YET."

i like the safety of Onstar, assistance systems for parking and backing. The Cue system does not work 100% well with my iPod..but it does work most of the time, by plugging into the usb port which tucked into the storage area in the dash board, which opens by gently swiping your finger on the bottom of the compartment. the downside of the C U E system is of course finger prints."

This car was great when it was new, but after 39k miles the build quality begins to show. I've had multiple repairs on the interior. Suspension is creaking, whistling noise from the wheels. Lots of road noise. Unusable Bluetooth phone over 30 mph. Thought this car was a great value compared to BMW and Mercedes, it isn't. You are not winning. This is a chevy cruise with a Cadillac badge and more powerful engine. The transmission is garbage, and I could never average more than 22.7 mpg. Terrible from a 4 cylinder. I traded it in for an Infiniti Q50, got the same payment and tons of technology. Not to mention 300hp V6 that gets better mpg. I could not be happier to get rid of this car. It's beautiful but a piece of junk. I gave America a chance again and was again disappointed. The technology you get and then build quality from the Japanese luxury cars is crazy when you compare prices. Don't be tricked into thinking this car is a good deal.

Called Cadillac up and put in a claim and they have stated that because the dealer says it's fine they can't do anything...so basically I'm stuck with a 50k POS.

also inviting. But the continuing problems surface every month. The quality is sub par to those imports. Craftmanshift is very poor. The look of the ATS performance is outstanding as the handling. I made a mistake of getting the 2.0. It has no punch from the gate. Aside all the fun this CAR has to offer. Its in the shop once a month for something. I lost the power steering once, not a good experiance. I even lost the dashboard lights,gauges.Going in now 4 mildew smell in AC, its killing me. 
The only upside of this car was the people who serviced it. I have to give Pepe Cadillac service all the credit for keeping this car on the road.  From the service director , advisors and technicians. They get 5 stars for the dedication and hard work.  Had this been a well made car, it would have been a marriage for a lifetime

cadillac,ats,2014,Jay, 10/04/2017,Where to begin....,3,"So i got this car after driving a 97 camry for 10+ years. I loved it so much but after awhile it was time to let her go. i always loved the grill and back of caddys and i had hit a point in my career where i could afford it so i went after it. Initially I LOVED IT. It was fast, stylish and beautiful in inside. Once i figured out you could manually shift, i completely lost it. The love affair didnt last long though. So first, and i dont know why this is the case, but the check engine light is attached to the coolant level. The first time it came on, i almost cried. I had heard that cadillac maintenace is CRAZY so i had prepared for the worst. After getting the code pulled i relaxed. this happened about 6-10 more times so either the ATS inhales coolant, or i had a leak. Second, its small as hell on the inside. Im 6 feet even and it was impossible for anybody to fit in the backseat behind me. Not the biggest problem, it just gives me a reason to not carpool. Now to the biggest issue....THE CUE SYSTEM IS TRASH. It ALWAYS lost connectivity with the bluetooth, then the touch screen just flat out stopped working. Upon doing research, its a common problem. I did love the secret compartment however. For this to be a ""luxury"" car, i felt they couldve did a better job with that. Last but not least, its depreciation rate is ridicoulous. Its worth about 1/3 of what i paid for it. Never again. to wrap this up, its a fun drive, real smooth, responsive, fast, quick and gas milage is great. Thats where my praise for it stops. dont buy, lease

cadillac,ats,2015,Steve Cain, 03/10/2016,Not your daddy's Caddy,5,"It's important to understand what this car is and is not.  If you think a Crown Victoria is a good car, the ATS is not the car for you.  On the other hand if you think a BMW 3 series is a good car, test drive an ATS, you will be surprised.  The ATS is a complete departure from the ""livingroom recliner on wheels"" approach of days gone by for Cadillac.  Its a drivers car cut from the cloth of European sports sedans.  (Think Audi A4, BMW 3 series) That means crisp handling, quick accelleration, relatively small size and a firm ride.  If you think these things are desirable, it's hard to beat an ATS, but if you want a numb isolated ride and don't care about handling, then please, buy something else.  For perspective,  I traded my wonderful BMW 5 series for the ATS and in most ways, the ATS is as good or better.

I've not driven the base 2.5 engine.  My ATS has the 3.6 V6 and for comparisson I have spent a few days driving the 2.0T and both perform similarly in terms of brute power... the 3.6 sounds more pleasant to me but both engines deliver lots of power.  If driven in traffic, the cars don't feel real fast because the throttle is easy to modulate in stop and go traffic... but if you stomp on it, you will see 60MPH in between 5 and 6 seconds.  If you enjoy driving fast on twisty roads, it doesn't get a lot better than the ATS for four seats.  Definitely not Crown Victoria like.

For more perspective, I'm in my 50's, 5'8 and fit fine in the front and back seats comfortably.  The up optioned seats are terrific even if 6 footers aren't going to be happy in the back seat, but they aren't going to be happy in the back of an A4 or 3 series either.  I have read some reviews on line about the ATS and draw the conclusion that some ATS buyers had no idea what they were buying.  They would be happier with an early 90's Crown Victoria.  That's fine, but you have to come to terms with what the car is and what it's intended to do.  The alternatives to my ATS are the Mercedes C250, Audi A4, and BMW 328.  If you think an alternative to the ATS is a Toyota Avalon, you should consider something else.  As for me, I love my ATS.

cadillac,ats,2015,Anmar Janabi, 06/13/2016,Great car for singles and as second car.,4,"I wasn't thinking into buying this car until I received a newspaper with an amazing offer. To be honest, the good deal drove me to the dealer to try the car. I leased it for about $140/mo cheaper than BMW, Mercedes, Audi.
I have driven BMW, Mercedes, Audi as well. This ATS really can compete with its sisters. 2.0T engine is amazing, powerful although little noisy when Turbo kicks in. I tried my friend's Audi A5 but ATS was faster in acceleration. Handling is stellar ! Braking is great, better than BMW and Audi due to Brembo brand. Check 60-0 mph braking on YouTube. I think it was 99 feets vs 101 feet for BMW, Mercedes, Audi.
Interiorly, I agree with others, it is small. Rear seat barely for 2 adults, and Trunk is much smaller than my previous Honda Civic. For me isn't an issue and I am slim, use the car for commuting only, rarely people get intro rear seat. Small trunk doesn't bother me, I have a SUV.
Great finish, wood trims, leather all over. But the touch part of the console is awkward. Physical buttons are more appropriate while driving.
Gear: for some reason manual downshifting is restrained. You need to pull hard to overcome the unexpected resistance. Upshifting is smooth. I don't understand why Cadillac does that.  Headlight is good, but the high beam light is poor. Don't thing it will lighten the road like BMW and Mercedes.
Overall, the performance is outstanding. But my advice is American cars should be leased only due to poor reliability after 3-4 years and low resale value.

cadillac,ats,2015,Rey, 03/16/2016,I love my ATS Premium,5,"I saw the ATS at the auto show and fell in love with it. However, I didn't rush into buying it. I compared it to BMW 3 series, Infinity, Acura (my former). I also watched and read comparisons of similar cars from Motor Trend, etc. Once I bought it I've never regretted it. It is very quick, handles fantastic (esp in sport mode) and nimble in traffic. My vehicle has the heads up display which works great and I especially like the auto braking during cruise control. I don't have to constantly hit the brakes any time a car slows down in front of me, the ATS adjusts the speed for me (great feature).

cadillac,ats,2015,Larry F., 01/22/2017,Great Buy - Missing Latest Technology,4,"Good gas mileage, great handling, small rear seat. Missing blind spot and cross traffic warnings, heated seats, etc... all in higher level models. For the price, should have been included. The headrest in the front seat force your head forward a bit too much making it uncomfortable for a 5'9"" driver.

cadillac,ats,2015,MGM, 02/09/2018,True Love,5,"The 2013 ATS was very impressive with regards to comfort, performance and technology. So, at lease end, I wanted more. The 2015 with added turbo blew me away. If torn between sporty, elegant, or aggressive, know that the ATS brings it all together.

cadillac,ats,2015,T G, 04/06/2016,Love / hate relationship,3,"The handling is stellar!  I also own a Porsche 911 and this is the only sedan I've ever driven that actually compares ok.  I also think the exterior look is fantastic - clean, timeless but also interesting.

However, I dislike just about everything else about this car.  CUE is horrendous.  It is unintuitive and talks too much when in voice prompt mode.  My wife's Audi blows away the Cadillac's interface.  While the 2.0ilter engine has reasonable power, you have to overcome both turbo lag and a slow transmission (mine has the 6 speed auto) in order to get good performance.  Even then, it sounds pretty bad - a bit like an overworked and muffled lawnmower.  If you ignore the sound and run the car in manual mode then it's fine, but who wants to do that.

These two things are irksome enough that I decided to sell the car.  Resale is absolutely horrible.  This is partially due to the fact that the car was overpriced in the first place.  I knew that going in but I wanted to buy American.  Poor resale doubles the pain.

If you want to buy the car anyway, get the V6, make sure it has the new 8 speed auto, and make sure you get a hefty discount on this overpriced car.

Overall, I would not recommend this car.

The only thing she did not like was the touch display on the cue display which does not have knobs. The ride is very comfortable and not noisy as said in the other review. Yes it is the Cadillac version of a sports car but having owned a 2012 Camaro R/S  this is like driving a BMW Series 3. Take a test drive before you buy or lease if it not what you want then move up the Cadillac chain.

cadillac,ats,2015,Luv my cars, 01/05/2019,Buying them used is the deal of deals N $AVE!!!!!!,4,"Picked up a 2015 from a dealer for $17,500 under 30K miles. That's a great price compared to the $35K sticker. They don't hold values, but they do perform well for the use sticker price. The AWD has 3 modes, Touring, Sport, and AWD. Now for those who want a comfortable car that runs really good, and has plenty of gitty up and go, with some really sweet interior, this is a nice ride. I've own a 2005 Corvette C6, LS2 400hp 400tq $55K new , and the 2006 Pontiac GTO $38K new. This car isn't a V8, but it will hang with any V6 non turbo and is a fun car to drive. You want 450 HP out of this 2.0L get some mods done, but don't be afraid to spend the money, for roughly about 3K you can get 325HP.... Its even possible to get 450 HP to wheels with this drive train.....Its a good deal used in my opinion for a used ride, although some people are way more pickier than me, and want new year models. Don't blow the cash on a new one, save it for the mods and a cool summer or winter cruising vacation in this car.

I'ts noisy and a rough ride.   Doesn't feel like you are driving a Cadillac.   Back seat difficult to enter and too small.    Small trunk.  Fold down back seats are a good feature.

This is not your grandpa’s Cadilac , this is more high tech sports car, very athletic, plenty of power. Exciting to drive.

cadillac,ats,2015,Dave Katreeb, 02/18/2016,"""extremely displeased""",1,"This is the worst Cadillac I've ever been in, I've owned two prior to this one. I am extremely displeased with my 2015 ATS 2.0T Luxury model.  If you are an average to large person, get in and out of the driver's seat a few times. The door pillar makes it very difficult. Most likely the worst feature for me. Look at the passenger room, sit in the back seat. It was very uncomfortable with four adults. The max load, passenger and cargo is only just over 800 lbs. The cab is small and noisy. Open the moonroof in either configuration and it's very noisy.  There is nothing that sets this Cadillac apart from any other vehicle. The Luxury model is sub par to the foreign cars standard models and almost twice the price. The 2.0 claims to get good mileage, I am only getting just under 20 mpg. There is nothing 'Cadillac' about my ATS.  I've had mine for two months and have less than 800 miles. I'd rather drive my 2006 Ford Ranger than the ATS, and I do. If you are in the market for a small sedan, look else where.

There had been just some minor recalls but service has been on par and always had a brand new loaner. Cue system was under warrant and had been replaced as Wes the rear view camera. I’ve most had any trouble since. The lower on this little devil is great and the ride is smooth and quite. Love the nose sound system. My only qualm is that the rear seating is a little tight. But don’t usually have anyone to transport. The way I drive I’m a little heavy on the peddle or my mpg would be accurate at 22.5mpg
"
cadillac,ats,2016,Clark, 06/14/2017,An overlooked gem of a car,5,"2016 Cadillac ATS 2.0 turbo luxury AWD trim is a great handling car. As many others have mentioned already, the vehicle is slick, drives extremely well, handles confidently, and overall a great driving car. When the sport mode is selected, the wheel and suspension gets noticeably tightened and gear changes at higher RPMs to allow for a quicker acceleration, which all makes it a very nice sporty experience. One feature I do not like is that the luxury trim does not have the HID lights (higher trims do have it). Halogen lights does the job, but it is nowhere near the brightness of HID. Backseat is cramped, but for small to normal sized people, it isn't uncomfortable. If ATS makes HID standard and add a couple more inches to the backseat legroom, in my mind, it would clearly beat BMW 3 series. Until then, it is so close, yet so far from the 3 series benchmark. At the same time, when I'm in the car by myself driving in sport mode on the highway, these couple of minor inconveniences are an afterthought. At 272 hp and 295 lb-sqft, the 2.0 turbo is the real steal among the trim offerings in my opinion. If you are looking for an entry level luxury sport sedan, I highly recommend you test drive the ATS 2.0 turbo and test out the acceleration and handling. You won't be disappointed.

Update: After 19k miles, the car is still great. No issues. Runs and handles excellent. Still loving the nimbleness, acceleration and instant power.

Update 2: After 32,000 miles, no issues. Now we know that Cadillac is replacing the ATS with the new CT4 (www.caranddriver.com/news/amp23599322/cadillac-ct4-sedan-future-cars/), this may place the last gen ATS as the best compact performance car Cadillac will have built for awhile, because the CT4 will have less power and torque. I may sound like a broken record to mention its outstanding sportiness, but the last gen ATS 2.0T competes with a very select few high performance 2.0T compacts: 3 series, Audi A4, MB CLA, and AR Giulia. This is an outstanding group to be part of from performance perspective. Not sure the new CT4 can be part of this discussion. The old ATS’s performance reputation will be preserved in the historical context. Some complain about its boxier look, but I find it classy and set apart from the competition. Local Cadillac dealership experience has been quality.
"
cadillac,ats,2016,Walt, 11/13/2016,The nod goes to Cadillac,5,"I traded in a BMW 320 for the Cadillac ATS all wheel drive.  The BMW is the segment leader and has been for many years for a good reason BUT, the Cadillac is better.  It is more comfortable, much quieter, quicker and a pure joy to drive.  It doesn't sound as sporty or feel as sporty, but it is overall an excellent car.  It is, after all, a Cadillac.
After 22,000 miles I still feel the same about the ATS, it’s a great car.
After almost two years of ownership and 29,500 miles, I still feel the same.  The ATS is a good-looking, well-designed machine and is a joy to drive.
I now have 39,000 miles on the odometer and the ATS is a joy to drive.
My ATS currently has 43700 miles and is still a good-looking joy to drive.
At 54,000 miles my ATS has been relatively trouble free and is still a joy to drive.

Great cornering and excellent acceleration provide an excellent feel behind the wheel. The car is 5 star safety in every category making the overall experience that much better. Had previous experience with 2.0 turbo and it was problem free although I only drove it for 50k miles. If you are not looking for a large sedan this could be your car. Drive it and you will like it.

cadillac,ats,2016,Bill Morgan, 11/30/2016,Makes you grin every time you drive it.,4,"This car in my opinion is a driver's car. The 3.6 liter V6 is very responsive, it makes nice noises. The chassis corners flat, the transmission bangs shifts off with authority, the steering is great and with the V Sport brake option I can keep out of trouble..  When you want to be sedate and laid back the ATS accommodates so nicely. Drove the car out west for vacation. Interstate highways were gobbled up with 32 mpg. Twisty mountain roads are where this little sedan shines baby! In sport mode I was hitting apexes at twice the limit and asking for more.

cadillac,ats,2016,Bob II, 10/13/2016,New ATS Coupe,3,"The car is beautiful with it's volicity red exterior and black interior. New the car had a loose connector in the driverside door. Within twenty four hours the cruise control quite working and the dealer can't get the correct part. After a couple months it started working. The Continental Procontact SSR run flat tires are noisy and hard riding.  Cadillac & Continental  refused to replace them. Rear tire alignment was off and dealer didn't mention when rotating tires. Had to replace tires at 24,00 miles due to broken belt, replaced with Bridgestone Driveguard Tires. What an improvement with driving comfort. The way tires and rims are designed, it's easy to scratch rims on curbs. If you use Apple Carplay with the iPhone navigation or OnStar navigation the radio wont play. Dealer isn't very helpful with assisting. No one to turn to. Don't recommend Apple carplay. Heater don't seem to provide heat consistently when needed.. Controls are dangerous to use and drive. CUE system is as dangerous as texting. Had trouble with drivers side window lowering enough to open door. Took Cadillac dealer four tries to fix, but when cold still won""t lower enough. works ok during warm temperature. Told dealer what I felt why, but he won't listen. For some odd reason transmission slips in low gear it's self when it shouldn't. Plastic cover on back of drivers seat fell off twice, Had to pop it back on, Cue screen went static, but had backup diagram showing driving forward.  Back up camera isn't clear on moist evenings. not sure if exhaust cause problem. Cadillac problem. Had same issue on Cadillac XT% loaner, but not as bad. Camera gets dirty easy, especially when raining.  Car value depreciated over $27,000, in less than two years. due to dissatisfaction I was going to trade in, but own more on car than it's worth. Even do I put a $10,000. down payment on. Had this car back to the dealer more than any car I've owned in 40 years. It's a shame such a beautiful car. will never buy another vehicle with run flat tires.

cadillac,ats,2016,Alfred McMullen, 08/21/2016,Transmission transition twitchy!,3,"When I got the got a few months ago, I was more excited about the electronics than the feel of the car.  A few weeks into driving I discovered how erratic  the transmission shifting was--you can actually feel the car going into gear and ,in some instances, the engine downshifts, which I consider unsafe.  Even with disabling the ""stop engine"" mode, you can feel the noticeable changes in shifting.  It is an unsatisfactory ride and I have owned or leased over 40 GM cars."
cadillac,ats,2016,Red, 03/29/2016,Fun 2.5L standard Caddy,5,"Since I just learned that the 2.5L engine will not be used in 2017, I will change my review to the following:

Honestly, I bought this car because it is a four door with ""rear wheel drive"" and handling is good. The price was greatly discounted on the ATS base model so I decided to purchase it rather than a Chevy Malibu. If the Chevy Malibu was rear wheel drive, I would have purchased one of those. The other reason for buying the ATS, is that my wife did not want a larger car than this. I preferred to buy a Dodge Charger or Chrysler 300, but what can you do. Happy wife, happy life.

cadillac,ats,2016,Curt H, 08/22/2019,Sweet car and great to drive,4,"I was looking for a used ATS earlier this year, primarily to avoid the steep value depreciation in the first couple of years.  I heard a lot of negative feedback from friends and others who have had older Cadillac models, but I have followed this car through it's release and updates.  My summary is that it drives really well, and overall is a great car that is also fun to drive.  If I have any complaints about it, they would be in the area of the transmission and attenuation that I get at certain speeds.  The dealer says that there isn't anything wrong with the car, and the learning transmission has adopted to my driving style better so I have less of that.  If I could give it a 4.5 I would but these nuisance things are minor.  The value for the price paid is really good, in my opinion.  The driving dynamics, especially on the highway, are stellar and probably the part I like best about this car.  
I have now had the car over a year, and every car has its issues.  Overall I would give it a 4/5 now instead of 5.  The transmission is not the best, too set up for fuel economy even in sport mode.  Also if the steering is cut all the way to one side it spits up a bit.  Still happy with it and glad I bought it used.  It runs fine on regular gas and gets good mileage.  The handling is the best part of the car.

cadillac,ats,2017,Fields Cadillac , 08/04/2019,Amazing changes,5,"I bought this type model starting with the 2010 SRX. I don’t think I’ll ever drive another type. I thought that car was awesome; great ride, lots of features, and the sound system is sooo good I can rock out. So I then got a 2014 (I like to keep cars under warranty). But then when I got the 2017 ATS, expecting it to be the same I was surprised. The shift stick took some getting used to. The gas mileage went up almost 20% I guess because the car is lighter and it has the stop start feature. The AI features are complicated but once you get the hang of it it’s an assistant. The “stay in lane ” feature has been very helpful teaching teenagers to drive. Also the “you’re too close”. I’m Sure they have fancy names but you get the gist. I use the heated seat feature on days when my back aches and steering wheel warmer on days ,y hands hurt. (Not often but I big day at the gym can sometimes be too much)  My particular Cadillac dealer (fields Cadillac  in jacksonville and st Augustine Florida) is practically like family. They take care of everything and it’s worth the 35 mile drive plus they give me a loaner and will feed people breakfast and lunch should you have to wait. What’s not to like?

Parts are very expensive, and these cars are a real pain to work on! It will be a choice you will soon regret, just like I did. I got next to nothing on trade in too, by the way!

It was probably low mileage because it likely was in the shop all the time like I have experienced!  I thought this platform was supposed to have been a well engineered Opel model brought to the U.S. to compete with the best sports sedans of the world?  In the 1st 7 months, I spent over one third of the cost of the entire car on repairs! The car has nice features and is a good driving car, but I would be afraid to take it out of town in cold weather out of fear of being stranded!!  I had hope to find my son a reliable car to take to college...I was very wrong!"

Everything had too be fixed by the dealer, no ASE mechanic could service it, but had it towed from their shop to the dealer.

I may complain about the appearance some but not much.  The fantastic interior far outways the exterior's short cummings.  The loud Bose sound system and fun to play with moonroof are great.  The leather memory seats are definitely of the Cadillac quality.  The engine could use a few more horses but I can't complain.  It still has great power.

Everything is going wrong with it, and it has cost us just about as much in repairs as the car did to begin with.  And today we found out that a oil sensor is bad, but they tell us that if they try and replace it at the Cadillac dealer, there is a chance that it will mess up the entire engine, and the engine will have to be replaced.  And Cadillac does not cover this, even though it is a design flaw.  Do not buy this car.   I have had other Cadillacs, and by far this is the worst."
cadillac,catera,2001,William H. Helfer, 04/16/2008,Love the car !,4,"The car looks great, drives great and has gives me excellent gas mileage. The engine should have more pep. The engine should run a bit more quietly."
cadillac,catera,2001,soren919, 01/16/2011,Utter Disappointment,3,"My very first car turned out to be a lemon and a stressor on my mother.
Seemed like a nice, clean car that wouldn't cost me a lot because it was a Cadillac and Cadillac's usually are pretty dependable.
But this car, just was an EPIC FAIL.
Now I'm trading it in and getting this burden off of me and my mother!
Engine repair costed $2000, then the brakes, then tires, then transmission (which has to be injected into engine which is even more money) sunroof works when it wants to, back wheel drive stinks (especially in snow and ice), power locks on driver side went out, and on top of all of that, CRAPPY gas mileage...please don't ever buy this car...all of these cars should be set on fire!!"
cadillac,catera,2001,Dustin, 06/24/2008,WORST cadillac ever to be made!!!!,2,"I have had this car since 2004 and have had nothing but problems. It had between 20 and 30k miles on it when I got it. Thought I was getting a steal at 14k. Now that I've had it a while, I realize why it was only in production for 4 years. Since 2006, I have replaced not only 1 but 2 engines and now this one quit yesterday. There are problems with the electrical system in it. The sunroof opens and closes when it wants to, the car is definitely a lemon and Cadillac should do something to alleviate some of the cost since it was their bright idea to sell an American made car that was produced in a foreign country. All together I'm at $9,000 in repair costs. And it's not paid off yet. "
cadillac,catera,2001,oil fire!, 09/08/2009,oil fire!,4,"My car caught on fire from a leak in the valve cover, and the fire messed up the wiring.  Since then all kinds of funny things happened. The radio worked when it wanted, the gas cap and the trunk switch locked and would not open. I liked my car because it was small and supple to operate, but when the expense of fixing it became too much, I traded it off for a Buick.  The final straw was the failure of the engine module which left me without a running car, and a wait for the new part.  I have pumped a lot of money into maintenance but this was too much.  The reliability was not good so I sold the car... Hated to see ol flame go, but it has gone to the great beyond now"

Have documentation with receipts showing $3,000 in replacement costs of motor, timing belt, radiator, etc. (fan belt broke & mom in law ruined motor but loved car so much we replaced it). Replaced tires 9/16 and repaired AC. Very clean car, very good interior, very good paint, very good air conditioning, glitchy radio but sound system phenomenal w cd player, mp3 or cassette.

cadillac,catera,2001,skubik, 02/26/2002,2001 Catera review,4,"I bought my Catera in October of 2001; the deal I got combined with 0% financing for 5 years was too good to refuse.  Overall I'm happy with my Catera.  It's cleanly styled both inside and out, and my car is tightly and solidly built.  Power is strictly average considering the car's weight, but for routine driving it's fine.  Handling is quite good, and the seating is roomy and very comfortable.  I've had two or three minor problems, but nothing major over the car's first 5,000 miles."
cadillac,catera,2001,Downsize, 07/05/2003,Great car... very under-rated!,4,"The person who posted on 4/13/03 must 
be nuts or probably drove the car into 
the ground.  Giving it ""4""s on the 
interior and exterior design--why'd 
you buy it?  I recently purchased mine 
used and found it to be a GREAT buy.  
Orignally 36K and got it for $18K with 
only 9000 miles.  Runs great, rides 
great, has a ton of features I didn't 
expect and never had a problem but 
then again I respect and take care of 
my vehicles."
cadillac,catera,2001,Albert, 08/07/2009,Worst Cadillac - EVER!,3,This car is a reliability disaster - a breakdown waiting to happen - it can be downright dangerous. A Cadillac-ized Opel isn't worth a dime. In less than two years 12K worth of warranty work. When the warranty is up this car is toast.
cadillac,catera,2001,mach2rio, 11/26/2002,catera review,4,"We have had nothing bue excellent 
service from our Catera.  Personally, I 
feel that the auto people of the world 
initially gave the car a bum rap and 
just could noe bring themselves to 
admit they were wrong.  Such as the 
editor's review here on the Edmunds 
site.

The only thing my wife does not like is 
having a CD changer in the trunk."
cadillac,catera,2001,Great Car, 06/29/2005,2001 Catera Sport,5,"Great Car, comfortable ride, pleasure to drive during trips. It really has the Zip Cadillac used in their marketing. Too bad after all the fine-tuning they did and then discontinued the model."

cadillac,catera,2001,Chris, 12/25/2004,Devil Vehicle,2,"The 2001 Cadillac Catera may be the most poorly built car of all time.  I had two seperate lemons involving the A/C and engine.

cadillac,catera,2001,Merckx, 03/07/2002,Der Mighty Opel,4,"What a checkered past this car has had. GM has been forced to give them away-mine was a little over $10,000 off list. So any problems pale in comparison. It's a real joy to drive-really pleasantly stiff steering. Everything has that satisfying German ""thunk"" to their operation. I could heartily recommend this car,if there are any left on the lots.

cadillac,catera,2001,mutbreath, 03/25/2002,Great Bang for the Buck!!!,3,"I bought this car for several factors including I must say the 0% interest and the deals that were to be found due to the fac that this car was discontinued.  I have had no major problems over the first 7000 miles and it is truly fun to drive. It could use a little more off the line acceleration but it is truly the ""Caddy that Ziggs"".  I would reccommend testing one for your self if you can still find them.  Especially the Sport model.  The larger wheels and stiffer suspension makes this car long for the open road."
cadillac,catera,2001,dcmertz, 04/19/2008,"Great interior,unreliable engine area",1,"My husband and I purchased this car 6 months ago. We have since then had the spoiler fall off (without the dealer taking ownership of this) the headlights are already clouded, replaced the front tires, and these are not inexpensive over $200 each. We have also replaced the idle arm, the coolant leaked behind the engine and only one place to get the part, and not inexpensive to fix, We paid 6000. However have in 6 months put in 2600 in repairs. whats next? The car handles great in the winter with over 6"" of snow, no complaints there, it's just the maintenance is not what we paid for and for the Cadillac name this is very disappointing. Wish we would have read up on it more. Buyer beware."

Shortly after I found out that many components have been altered to fit GM's US-requirements, which do not include quality.  I have the same issues as many posted here, electrical issues (US version has an extensive OBD-II emission system which is not even cleaner than Europe's)and mechanical issues (rough running engine, stalling)."

Love the accent lighting along the dashboard seam & how the lighting flows into the door seams. Seating is good for long trips & cruising. Better than the G37.  Exterior: - eye catching head turning. love or hate it people will look. I love the center exhaust & they stayed true to the angular lines throughout the design.

I bought my coupe with 72k on it for $12700, everything works great, It does need new back struts ( easy fix $500) my mpg is really bad tho that would be my only complaint, I'm averaging 20.5 which is low considering its rated at 18/27. Other than that I couldn't be happier with it, its truly a sport luxury coupe. Reliable, zoomy and not to mention one of  the sleekest designs ever! you can't go wrong with it.

Terrific road handling.  But don't expect to use the back seat.  Don't let anyone park near you (due to the width of the doors).

I love this car more than my '08 CTS! The styling is fantastic! I have had about 22 new cars through the years and I have never received this many compliments on a car before, and I have had some really nice cars! The interior and exterior are beautiful. The seats are comfortable, the 304 HP with the 6 speed trans is very smooth and it uses regular gas! My '08 and my new coupe both are all wheel drive which are absolutely great in the snow, actually fun to drive! I went with the 18 inch all season tires and FE2 suspension which gives great handling and a firm but very nice ride."
cadillac,cts-coupe,2011,RF, 09/26/2010,Very Impressive CTS Coupe,5,"I just came out of an '07 CTS V6 Direct Injection, Premium. The new CTS Coupe has some very significant improvements. There is a dramatic reduction in road noise and now the car is quiet. The drive is much more comfortable with improved shock absorption, braking, handling, and acceleration, but still feels sporty. Stereo speakers also significantly improved, and there is an incredible Navigation System and Hard Drive..Trunk is a little smaller, but rear seats go down. This car has been tweaked!"
cadillac,cts-coupe,2011,axle33, 01/21/2012,This car is my Corvette!!!!,4,"I could have chosen any car I wanted under $100K, & I chose the CTS 2 door Coupe in Diamond White Tri-coat. I love the color, sporty styling, body lines which are so futuristic & the dual exhaust tips in the middle of the car side by side just under the middle brake light looking like the tail of a speeding comet! I am 6 foot 5 inches tall & weigh just under 300 pounds & this car fit best for me as compared to the Camaro or the Corvette. No one can ride behind me so it is basically a 3 person car when I have my seat against the back seat but I don't care. Only if the XLR were to have looked so good! I think if you want or need a back seat, buy the four door CTS or the wagon. Yes, I'm in LOVE"
cadillac,cts-coupe,2011,dam22, 04/23/2011,Sport Car Performance & SUV Comfort-Luxury,5,"As long one considers the CTS Coupe as a 2 seater, it is tough to top.
Mine is a stick ordered from Detroit. Performance is only slightly below that of my 350Z; excellent acceleration & swings through the twisties with abandon.
Comfort is first rate with large cabin (for 2), well laid out controls & dash, and every amenity known to modern man including a 40 GB harddrive & 10 speaker Bose for music.
The inside fit & finish is the best I've ever seen.
The car is a work of art inside & out.
Go sit in one.
Do consider the back seat usless; anyone over 2'6"" will not fit & you'll need a shoehorn to get them in.
But no one will buy this bomb who really needs 4 seats."

cadillac,cts-coupe,2011,carlson4RXN, 08/21/2010,2011 Cadillac CTS Coupe critical faults!,2,"1. 304 hp is not enough, a V-8 w/400 hp should be standard for this vehicle. 

2. Front seats are terribly uncomfortable,replace them w/ seats from the sedan or the SRX - lots of good comfort. 

3. The exterior paint colors are too few and many should be put only on outhouses. Paint options should include all of the Cadillac colors and be at no cost added. 

4. The back seats for only 2 people is silly and very uncomfortable. Fix this and make the seat flat for extra room. 

5. The performance package w/only summer time tires is stupid stupid! 

6. The ride is sometimes rough, fix this and make it a luxury comfort ride like a real Cadillac! 

7. The hot rear exhaust pipes can burn your legs if touched."
cadillac,cts-coupe,2012,TMH, 03/22/2017,Great 1 or 2 person car,5,"Don't expect anyone to get into or ride in the back seat.  Nearly impossible to sit up as adult and thus should consider this car a ""two seater"" and 3/4 only in emergency or children (w/o childseat...it is very hard to get it in and kids head will hit ceiling!).  Golf clubs will NOT fit widthwise: sure the car is wide enough, but GM Engineers (in their infinate wisdom) made the trunk supports so they come down in the trunk and squish anything taller than 4"" tall for at least 6"" from each side.  And the best engineering feat?  Do NOT let your key fob go dead or low.  To get into car (there are NO key holes in either door) you have to open the trunk (the key hole is 3"" above license plate top...hidden.  Once trunk is open, there is a plastic pull tab under rear window deck (if you are over 5' tall, you cannot see it without leaning into trunk).  Pulling opens driver door.  You now are in the car-but fob is only way to start it-so you are sunk.  Don't get me wrong, I love this car-but you had better know idiosyncracies before buying it!

Its as nice on the inside as it looks on the outside. Very comfortable seats and clear well thought out controls. A little disappointed in the 10 speaker Bose audio systems power output but the sound is crisp and clean. The six speed shiftable auto is smooth and quiet.The engine seems
under powered and struggles to haul this small yet 3900 lb. car up to speed from a stop. It has good freeway punch and does well once you get it rolling. Handling is tight and flat and inspires confidence in wet or dry conditions and

The sport supension gives the car a tight and sporty feel. Handling and cornering are great.

I was tired of the expensive quirkiness of my past BMW's and Mercedes and after 4 Lexus' - wanted something different. This car has unique style, you don't see 4 of them t every stop light and it is quiet, has a great sounding engine and is comfortable."

It's hard to walk up to it without a smile on your face and you get a lot of positive reactions from other people. The interior is also very nice, as with all of the CTS line. The seats are firm, but comfortable. I've made a 2-day, 1400 mile trip in the coupe and was very comfortable. I have the performance collection coupe w/o the summer tires and the ride is firm, controlled but comfortable. I don't feel isolated from the road but I don't feel every bump in it either. The car performs well and is a lot of fun to drive. The rear seating is tight, I would never put an adult back there ... who in their right mind would buy a coupe for the back seat? "
cadillac,cts-coupe,2012,Marialana Lenhart, 04/16/2016,"solid, responsive and capable",5,"Don't buy a CTS coupe if you have difficulty getting in/out of a car, or are looking for a roomy rear seat compartment for adults.  Do buy the car if you appreciate a solid, responsive and capable road experience.  I bought the RWD because I preferred a smoother drive compared to the AWD CTS's I tested, and have so far experienced very good traction on interstate travel in downpours.  Doubt I will want to drive the CTS during major snowstorms, but I bought it already having a car for extreme winter weather.
I think the car looks great and garners respect from other vehicles.  I have read about CTS owners who experience a 'shudder' in low speeds before the transmission moves into a higher gear.  I have experienced this one or two times at very low speeds, but during normal driving acceleration it has not been noticed.   I wanted a comfortable touring car with a lot of attitude, and this is what I've found the car to have.  Less than 40,000 miles and runs like new.

Paint is still easily chipped.

Still only basic maintenance done to vehicle.  Oil change, tire rotation, etc.  No warranty work needed at all.

Need to be careful that the driver's side window lowers itself before closing the door.  Had a couple times closing the door where the window jambs against the door frame and bent the door trim a bit.

I am 6-5, lots of head/leg room (no sunroof).
I have about 3 inches of clearance from my head to the roof.
I need to move the driver's seat about 3 inches forward from the farthest back position for comfort.

Trunk space is fair, 2 rolling bags and some extra stuff.

Right leg rests against the center console while driving, this isn't very comfortable.

cadillac,cts-coupe,2014,Joseph Butkiewicz, 06/04/2016,Sophisticated Sports Coupe,5,"This car is quick, responsive, comfortable and stylish. The ride is European in nature providing good road feedback so you know the conditions of the surface. Driver and front seat passenger ingress and egress is excellent, but being a coupe, the rear seat people are somewhat hampered. But then buyers who opt for the coupe don't really care . My only negative comment on the car after four weeks or so of ownership is the lack of depth in the center console storage area. You can't fit a compact disc in it. Having to store them on the passenger's seat is messy and access to them is problematical at best. In general, however, I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing the car. Too early to comment on reliability issues, but I would expect them to be adequately addressed by GM in a prompt and satisfactory manner.

cadillac,cts-coupe,2014,Blake, 12/29/2018,My second CTS Coupe!,4,"I just traded in my 2012 CTS Coupe Performance for a 2014 CTS Coupe Premium.  A nice  upgrade!  Of course its a coupe and limited access to the rear seats, but expected in this size of a coupe.  Many upgrades from the Performance to the Premium!  Although it does not have the upgrades the 2018-2019 Caddy's may have, it still pretty impressive for a five year old.  Very heavy coupe and a “standard” V8 would be more appropriate (excluding the V series), since the mpg really isn’t a factor.

Cadillac redesigned the 2014 CTS sedan including adding the Que system but left the coupe the same using 2008 technology.

It drives as nicely as any car I've driven--precise handling, smooth quiet ride and a lot of power.  I have the thunder gray finish-- it's gorgeous.

cadillac,cts-wagon,2010,Robert, 11/28/2010,Best car yet,4,I absolutely love my CTS wagon.  The interior finish is well done.  The ride is silky smooth.  I get so many compliments.  There are so many SUVs that I am glad to have a vehicle that is not like every other one out there.  I recently began using the sport mode and think it makes up for the 3.6l engine option I passed on.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a great driving vehicle with more space but does not want a suv.

This is my third wagon, the first being a BMW 3 and the most recent a loaded Magnum HEMI.  I never imagined driving a Caddy until I saw this beauty.   The interior quality is excellent and so is the ride.  Fit, finish and touch are exactly what I was looking for and are better than BMW.  BMW has been stuck in a time warp for far too long.   You can't really compare this to the Magnum HEMI quality wise, but HEMI wins the need for speed any day. The Caddy is no HEMI (unless you get the CTS-V).  I had owned it less than 30 minutes before I got my first compliment.  It's a pleasure to drive fun to drive."

The 3.6 delivers more than ample power, I ordered the 19"" summer package as well and like the FE3 Brakes, I don't find the ride to suffer at all with the sport suspension, quite comfortable. The styling of the Wagon does turn heads that's for sure, I like the stance of the wagon better than the sedan.

cadillac,cts-wagon,2012,Dee Salla, 01/03/2018,Wagons Ho!!,5,"I LOVE a station wagon and was thrilled when my favorite car designed one. This is my 4th Caddy, the first two being STS's and third an SRX. The SRX was my least favorite. Wagons are wonderful. You have the style, ride and comfort of a fancy sedan with the luggage space of an SUV. I haul around two Golden Retrievers and they like the comfort also.  Although the head room in the SRX was better for the dogs because in the wagon they tend to hit the inside roof area and turn on the overhead light, they still look darn good in my diamond white Caddy. ;) Update. I have had my car for three years now and I still love it. My only complaint is the floor mats. They need to design a way that they stay in place. The button/hook has ripped out of the carpet and the floor mat is constantly sliding under the peddles. I have removed it from the car for safety reasons. Currently I have 63000 miles and it still runs great. Jan 6, 2019 and still loving my car. Just wish I had floor mats.

As a current GM employee, this was pretty much my only option - but I'm really glad I decided to get it. It doesn't look like anything else on the road - and I really like that. I'm always getting compliments on its appearance, and it's really sharp in black.

I just took it on a 1,000 mile road trip and it performed admirably. Great handling and 23 mpg on the highway with luggage, passengers, and a heavy foot. I could probably even get the advertised 26 mpg if I gave the tires a little more air. "

cadillac,cts-wagon,2014,Matt, 06/23/2019,One year into 3.6L AWD wagon ownership.,4,"The Good: Sporty Handling, grips the road, great brakes, decent power, no rattles, lots of room for storage, car feels steady and safe at all speeds. Absolutely great road feel and balance. Mine ran the 1/4 mile at 15.2 seconds at around 94 mph which ain't bad for a 6 cylinder wagon. Car takes 87 octane with a +320hp motor with a high +11:1 compression ratio. All wheel drive is great in the snow. THE BAD: Big people will have a hard time getting into the car. Sporty handling is a bit firm for a Cadillac that only thinks it fast (mine does not have Magna Ride option). I only get 17.5 mpg around the city. Maintenance parts for a 2014 model year can confuse regular service centers because in 2014 all other CTS models (non-V & coupe) changed the platform (new model design). The lack of engine torque makes the car feel slower than it is IMHO (the engine has something like 270 ft lbs of torque but 320hp). You really can't tow with this car but I think that's pretty obvious to most folks. ALL IN ALL: Good all around car that I don't regret purchasing. Cheaper than a SUV.

Inside: leather, keyless, popup infotainment screen, back up camera, Bluetooth and remote start turns the HVAC and/or heated seats on for you, depending on temp. The Recaros aren't worth $3500 over the base seats, which offer nice lateral support.  The CTS-V coupe IS the total package. A perfect daily driver, luxury coupe or track car, its easily worth $80- 100k. I've only owned imported cars until now and it's nice having American muscle in my garage."

The downsides are few. First, the car is not built as well as newer GM models that I own; my Cruze is much better built. The CTS-V's interior creaks and has had a number of other minor issues. Next, the car really begs for more than 70 mph speed limits. Can't blame the car for that though."

 Panamera's lack of 5 seats, and S7 too, ruled them out (3 kids).

Don’t believe a review from C&D or Motortrend. I don’t have a clue why anyone would purchase either of these birdcage liner providers. This car does everything as well as 95% of the world could want. Its fast, handles, comfortable, especially with the Recaros and stop better than any car at its weight and a hell of a lot better than most lighter ones. I have owned 3 of these, all manuals, one with sunroof, two without, I never open them. These cars hold their resell value better than any other Caddy accept perhaps the V series CT6? Time will tell. I would love to keep the miles low on my 15, but it’s just too much fun to drive. I have never had a single issue with anything with this car. I take very good care of my automobiles, I change the Mobil 1 every 3500 miles, try to keep them from rain and never do they see snow or salted roads. Compared to the MB wagons there is no comparison. The Cadillac is far superior. Three mid 2000 4Matics and they all sucked. One trans went bad, but nagging little things like AC doors not closing, wipers only working on two speeds, tire sensors that didn’t work and worst, airbag warning lights that stayed on from day one until sold.( I will never own another MB. If you get a chance to own a V wagon, take care of it, don’t modify it and chances are it will be worth more than you paid for it years from now. I have a 95 ZR1 and a 2015 CTS-V Wagon that I will keep till I die and will continue to enjoy driving. I have a few other keepers but aren’t as much fun to drive as these two, well there are a couple that are fun I just can’t afford to lose my license again. For some reason a 2019 ZR1 is the biggest Cop magnet I have ever owned and if you accidentally bump the accelerator it will cost you two tires and one very large ticket, they will make up words to add to the ticket just so the judge will add cost, like you needed him to!

Replaced the left front wheel hub at 105,000 miles and the right is near ready to be replaced.
The steering wheel programing is in need of fixing because the wheel don't move up on exit but down.
The CD player rejects and gives an alarm code.
The dash cover rolled up on the edges which is common on those models but was simple to repair with adhesive and replace. Love the car"
cadillac,deville,2000,duraflex, 01/11/2014,14 years old and still going strong,5,"I have owned a 2000 Cadillac DeVille DHS for about 5 years.


When a favorite relative passed it on to me, it was almost 9 years old and had sat unused in a garage for at least 2 years with just 22,000 miles on it.
Professional mechanics told me I would likely have all kinds of very expensive problems with it and offered to take it off my hands and pay me $2000.
GM was in trouble at the time but I decided to keep the car and take the risk.


With the exception of replacing the battery, tires and overhauling the brakes - they were wrong about every other dire prediction. 

In 5 years, I've spent about $5000 in repairs and maintenance on the car.
It's been worth every dollar.

UPDATE as of Nov 2014:   After owning the 2000 DHS for a total of 6 years, I traded it in on a 2006 Cadillac DTS.   Although the styling on the 2006 is a bit more chiseled and refined, the 2000 definitely rode better and quieter - wish I had kept it.

cadillac,deville,2000,dtsfan, 08/08/2011,I Love My DTS.... Still,4,"As a child of the sixties, I always admired the iconic Cadillac brand.
Back when I was a kid, a Cadillac was a Cadillac and everything else paled in comparison.
As I approached 45 years old, I was looking to buy a car and looked at everything, from BMW to Jaguar to Mercedes Benz, but my wife had been working for a major cosmetic company and had earned 2 pink Cadillacs in 02 & 04.
That's where I fell in love with the Deville.
It had everything, style, prestige, confort, performance, and reliability.
The DTS ticked all the boxes for what I wanted in my own car.
So I found my bronzemist DTS and brought her home.
5 years later, I'm still in love with her."
cadillac,deville,2000,2000 DHS, 05/07/2006,2000 DeVille,4,"The trade-off between handling and comfort is excellent.  For a large heavy car with a  relatively powerful V8,the fuel ecomony is very good.  I changed the front tie-rods and front engine mount after 60,000 miles.  Also, the front seat warmers no longer work and the Northstar engine burns oil.  Other than that, this is a great car."

is all the plastic and the fit and

cadillac,deville,2000,freddy, 12/25/2004,Great car,5,"Purchased my 2000 Cadillac DeVille with 2,000 miles on it. I had a Lincoln Town Car.  The DeVille handles better and has better acceleration. It gets good gas mileage. the sun visor too low for tall people though.  GM's engineers have changed this for 2001. I have not experienced any major problems with this car.  The check engine light came on once.  It was repaired with no problems at the dealer.  The Cadillac DeVeille comes witrh a good warranty.  The Northstar engine usees minimal oil every 2,000 - 3,000 miles. Just add a quart and keep driving. the front windshield had an airleak which made noise, but this was repaired by my dealer at 3,000 miles and is now OK.  This car's windshield is known to be poorly sealed at factory."
cadillac,deville,2000,DanA, 03/09/2008,"Great Vehicle, but have cash",4,"I bought this DTS in 2003 with 114,000 miles from a dealer in MI. The exterior and interior were spotless. They still are other than the driver's seat leather due to my daily driving. All I had to do was test drive a DeVille to know what my dream car was.  The car drives solid, accelerates smoothly, and always runs strong from acceleration to passing speeds. I love this car, yet it does have serious maintenance issues. When parts fail, shop around for labor, but expect to spend major dollars on parts. Northstar does burn 1qt oil / 2k mi or so, but is very tolerable as this doesn't seem to have major effects."

Great fuel economy and mostly everything is great about the car. not any problems since our family bought it back in 2000 except normal services. Highly recommend this car. 
cadillac,deville,2000,JB, 09/30/2008,Northstar oil use,3,"For every one that posted a note about oil consumption, a quart or so every 2000 miles or so is somewhat normal.  Excessive consumption can also be related to piston rings being stuck due to ""babying"" the engine.  One relatively easy solution is to find a clear stretch of road, place the car in second gear and accelerate quickly up to ~ 70 mph, then coast down to 40 mph (no braking!).  Do this 3 -4 times.  It will help keep the piston rings floating free and seated against the cylinder walls, reducing oil consumption.  Dealers and knowledgeable mechanics can also perform a chemical cleaning."
cadillac,deville,2000,fred, 11/02/2009,solid,4,"bought mine with 71k about a year ago.  now has 96k and only have replaced an egr valve.  does burn 1 quart between oil changes but from reading here, typical.  great gas mileage 25 on highway.  great punch when you need it.  just replaced brakes all around for 350.00 with ceramic pads and the egr valve was about 200.00.

A/C blowing greasy stuff out of vents at 90K mi. Torque converter out again at 105K mi. All repair prices/parts out of sight because it's a Cadillac. My used cars all were better than this one.

cadillac,deville,2000,John, 08/21/2019,Head Gaskets can Blow on some Northstar Engines,3,"My wife treated her Cadillac with kid gloves and it was Garaged from day one. When it began OVERHEATING at only 63K, I knew we had a problem. Our Local mechanic performed what was known as THE TRIPLE PLAY. They replaced the water pump, the thermostat, and the upper crossover gaskets. Turned out that the engine's Head Gaskets were blown and a local Cadillac Dealer quoted me $7,500.00 to replace them. GM knew that some of their Northstar Engines were blowing head gaskets, but failed to do anything about it. Came down to Aluminum Heads on Steel Blocks and temperature changes for the two different metals. Their Bolts were too short and the bite in the Steel Blocks didn't hold. Norm Huhn (huhnsolutions.com) had the patent on fixing that engine's problem as well as sourcing a local Cadillac Mechanic who knew how to properly fix the problem. Overall, it takes 3 days since the Car has to be lifted off the engine once everything from the engine has been disconnected. Anyway, our 2000 Cadillac DHS Sedan Deville now runs just fine and like the day my wife drove it out of the Dealer's Showroom. YES, there is LIFE after blown head gaskets on these Cadillacs. Just a matter of contacting Norm for his insert kit and finding a Mechanic who knows how to do the job properly. Other than that and replacing most of the sensors, this car has a brand new life and much more to go. 20K after the fix and still going strong! In the end, it only cost me $3K to replace the heads PROPERLY on this Northstar Engine and it runs great!

cadillac,deville,2000,Caddy Lover, 10/29/2008,Love It!,4,This is an awesome vehicle! This is my fourth Cadillac and it carries the tradition perfectly. The mirrors tilting can be controlled by the feature programming as can most functions and are programmable to seat memory. the new design is good: still looks like a big ole Cadillac but is modernized and stylish. Peeforms well for a large vehicle and comfort has always been Cadillac's benchmark. has about 80k miles and runs like a clock standard maintenance only! uses some oil about 1.5 quarts per change but is not bad giving the volume it starts with (almost 7!). I hope to keep this car as long as possible and keep it next to my Fleetwood Brougham until my son can drive it. Cadillacs Always!

jams, through the twisting canyons at 50 mph and on the highways at 70 
MPH.  The interior comfort is fine, and the ability to sit 6 in a pinch (hope the 
person in the middle front is a kid!) is a plus.  Those that feel that they need 
to buy a BMW or Mercedes to get a good ride and luxury should look at the

I love the steering wheel controls for the radio, gotta have that.  This car has two personalities, if you drive conservatively you'll get really good gas mileage, I average about 20.5 miles per gallon this way (city & hwy combined).  However, if you want to drive fast, it will do that too, without hesitation.  It will go like a scalded dog, but the gas mileage will drop to about 16 mpg.  Its highway mileage is superb, about 23 mpg."

The Night Vision, Stabilitrack, park ride assist are just some examples. I had a Mercedes-Benz S600 in the past and the confort was too poor and the performance was less impressive that the DTS! Wow!!! Three months ago, I asked to a Mercedes-Benz's salesman what was the difference between this Cadillac and the S600 of Mercedes. He told me : You must be agree to pay 50 000 $ in more !!! I think that I will keep a Cadillac for the rest of my life."

cadillac,deville,2001,Christian, 02/07/2010,Caddy Deville,4,"I purchased a 2001 Cadillac Deville (Base Sedan) in 2004 with 9,000 miles on it. It was purchased from a prominent local dealer, and it looked new, smelled new, and drove new the day I drove it off the lot for a total price of $25,000 including the 5 year 75,000 mile extended warranty. The car drove like a dream for the first 3 years, and was overall problem free as for the 4th year on, it has been extremely time consuming costly in order to keep it running sufficiently and looking good. The extended warranty on the vehicle recently ended in July. The company was exceptional. From the year 2004 to 2009 the warranty spent over $10,000 in repairs for this car "

better in handling and comfort.  BUT, 
there have been too many defects.  Had 
to replace entire engine wiring 
harness (took a week), steering rack, 
chip controlling the steering feedback 
to Stabilitrac system, heated seat 
wiring in front (burned out), seat 
belt tensioners - plus a few other 
build problems.  Gas mileage in city 
about 14.5 - hgwy about 22, but a real

treacherous country backroads.  Unless 
Cadillac (& all GM) get on the backs 
of their suppliers to improve quality

the imports- class for class-."
cadillac,deville,2001,Vincent Roane, 01/02/2010,All That Glitters Is Not A Gold Cadillac,3,"First let me say that I have always admired Cadillacs since I was a little boy. All 4 of my uncles owned a Cadillac at one time or another. A beautiful car to drive and be admired in. However, repairs can be expensive for a domestic car. I strongly suggest purchasing an extended warranty immediately. It burns alot of oil. And takes 8qts to do an oil change. Which the dealers all say is normal. At 100,000 the selonoid transmission started to go bad. And the oh so dreaded sensor modules always tend to fail on all cadillacs at some point which costs between $500-$800. Other than all of that. It's a beautiful car to drive and look at, but no fun to repair. Keep $500 on hand at all times."
cadillac,deville,2001,dot driggers, 08/07/2005,It's a great car,4,"I have  been very happy with this car.  I am a widow who is very mechanically illiterate and I have had no trouble or worry with it. If  I do not keep it, I will  get another Cadillac.  It is very  comfortable and the interior is particularly nice I think.  I  like the ""extra"" gadgets it  has, like  the information panel. "

It had less than 20K mi when I bought it in '05. I've put less than 30K mi on the car since owning it. In that time, I've spent $5700 in repairs. That is awful for a car that has fewer than 60K miles on it. In the 5 yrs I've owned the car, it has cost me $1100/annually in repairs. That's pathetic. Those repairs consist of complete axle work, brakes, rotors & shocks, new transmission w/ all 4 motor mounts, new starter, window problems & many more problems, not to mention that it drinks oil. I got rid of that pc of junk & bought a Honda! No more GM for me. No Thanks!"
cadillac,deville,2001,Mike E., 11/25/2015,2001 for $2000,4,"I just recently bought a 2001 Deville in the typical ""old person"" color of tan. I needed a cheap car to get to and from work. It has 160xxx miles on it and cost $2000
So far it has not impressed me but for such a low cost, what can I expect. I was leasing a 2015 Kia Optima and this beater Caddy actually rides better than the brand new car.
I was told prior to purchasing it that it will need a torque solenoid thing but the mechanic assured me that it could be replaced a little later on. I too have experienced the horror of the power windows not working. Currently the driver side front is the only one working but again... $2000

Quality is another story... Engine started burning oil at the rate of 1 quart every 400 miles. Thank heaven I got the extended warranty! Dealer rebuilt the motor, new pistons and rings, $5600.00 and 3 days in the shop. This car had something break every month. All 4 power window regulators broke, 3 fixes on the brake lights, torque converter problems, stability control warnings, too many things to list here. I recently traded it in because the warranty was about to expire, which had a $100 deductible for each occurrence. Quality was crappy at best. car had less than 70k mi"

Since I have owned my DeVille I have found out that the engine uses oil to the extent of a quart every 1,700 miles and is viewed by GM as NORMAL according to their service bulletins. Therefore, no attempt to correct problem.  In addition, I have had two coolant leaks, an engine mount replaced, an electronic control module replaced, both wheel hubs and front bearings replaced, a trunk seal replaced, and the list goes on.  Now I undertstand why I got a bumper to bumper extended warranty to 100,000 miles as a certified used car. Unfortunately, it still isn't enough."

It's looks/comfort are up there with Mercedes, but I have owned many different cars and this car is by far the most unreliable car I've ever owned. In the past year I have had all the window motors/regulators replaced, one engine mount was cracked in half, all new brake pads a few months ago and now they squeak all the time. The dealership said it is a common problem though even though there is life left on the pads. The tire pressure sensors are all broken, the transmission fluid sensor is broken, coolant sensor is broken, and the heated front drivers seat is broken...HONDA HERE I COME!"
cadillac,deville,2001,cadiman95, 10/29/2011,Best cars ive owned,4,My dad just bought me this car it is very pretty i love it best car ive driven. The performance of this car is amazing for a car that weighs almost 5000 pounds it can beat any car off the line and in a race. All of my cadillacs have made it to 200000 miles without any problems. When you buy cadillacs look for the R sticker under the hood if it has that then it weill last you as long as you want. The girls also love it. I raced my friend who had a 2008 infiniti m35x and he was amazed at how fast this car is. It is so comfortable but at the same time fun to drive. no japanese car can match this car. I love cadillacs and will own one for as long as i live you really need to buy and own one.

However, this car has many repair problems, i.e., oil leaks, steering problems, I have had many sensors replaced, both front hubs, both cv joints, water pump,a/c compressor and too many other repairs to mentions.  I feel a vehicle with only 90000 miles should not have had that many repairs.  I have a 93 Honda Accord with 220,000 miles and I can count the repairs I have made on it. "

I would still recommend buying a car like this, because the comfort and looks outweigh the problems. Its a great car"
cadillac,deville,2001,W J TX, 10/07/2007,Over rated over priced,3,"This car looks great however driving it I notice poor rear visibility for backing and parking. The powerful engine is a bit too much for a FWD car, full throttle at 30 mph is a bit risky since the car darts in one direction or the other depending on the road. Replaced both hubs, no help. The fuel consumption is high in city driving acceptable on the open road though. This engine is an oil hog about a qt. every 1000 miles which GM says is normal for the Northstar, explains the 7.5 qt. crankcase. Transmission oil life sensor does not work. Plastic in and out is poor quality, dash pad warping, fender liners crack just from stones on the road. Had a rented 2007 for a month was no better."
cadillac,deville,2001,Dan, 08/05/2007,Maintenance nightmare,4,"This is my 3rd new Cadillac and although I love it, it is not a quality car. It will use a quart of oil every 1500 miles.

hours to my house, then riding for 2 
hours in the backseat, I'm convinced 
this is the only way to travel. The

The car has been worry free. The only things I've done are oil changes, replacement of the original tires at 55K miles, wheel alignment and 60K maintenance service.  I would have never imagined myself driving a Cadillac, but this car is fantastic, esp. 28 MPG on the highways.  It does like oil, but the car display tells you when to add it and the dealer told me this is typical of Cadillacs and GMs in general."

cadillac,deville,2001,koole, 02/19/2007,To Caddy or Not to Caddy,4,"The DeVille is a great looking car.  It has abundant features.  I wish it had cooled seats like '04 and newer models though.  It also has a nice clean interior setup, everything is easily within driver's reach."

actually in a lot of way agree with 
each and everyone of them. But now its 
my turn to defend one of Americas last

good ride on the highway, very 
comfortable. Thats why people drive 
these cars great highway monsters. As 
far as dependablity goes I have never 
had any problems. Now as far as Lexus 
goes there service drives are very busy 
so if they are all that why are they 
always in the shop????????"
cadillac,deville,2001,John DiPilla , 03/26/2002,Missing the Luxury Boat,3,"The Luxury Flagship for GM kind'a misses the mark on quality.  During the short ownership time (3.5 months) several significant mechanical issues were noted, not promptly fixed, with causes only the factory could correct (I can't blame the dealer).  One issue took so long to repair even the ""new - and free"" loaner I had while waiting for mine to be repaired had the problem..."

Chevys, Pontiacs, Olds, Buicks, Triumphs, Healy,  Honda Accords, a Toyota Camry, a VW Bug, and a Mercedes E-320...which was a real costly mechanical lemon.  My 18 years old 2001 Special Edition Cadillac DeVille is by far the best of them all, Number One for comfort, quiet, great for long trips, and reliability, and it STILL  RUNS  LIKE  NEW. The only maintenance has been tires, a battery or two, and  one brake job, one change of spark plugs, two side window regulators and the key ignition switch.

My wife has a 70 miles commute every day, so we are putting a lot of milage on the vehicel. Plush ride, very comfortable. However, every 4 months or so there had been issues - mostly with the electronic. Every visit in the shop is at least $700. No wonder that you can by those used ones so dirt cheap - you need to invest $3,000 or more every year just to keep them running! Gas milage is about 19 MPG on premium gas (the poster who reported 30+ miles is clearly smoking something!) with a mix of city & highway."
cadillac,deville,2002,potsynolls, 09/14/2014,Not sure what Cadillac is anymore...,3,"I think that the devilles' are good sized cars that eliminating any cramped feelings that most other cars can have. This is a definite upgrade from chevy division products, and I am sad to see the company changing it's product line up into unfamiliar territory. Being a 2002 deville I have made and paid for some repairs which isn't fun, but eventually any 10+ year old car is going to need some work done to it. I am still a little confused to what Cadillac thinks that they are competing with at the same price points of everyone else. I think that the build quality of cadillacs should be the standard for all GM products instead of them continuously pumping out tin can crap to consumers."

cadillac,deville,2002,Harry, 11/15/2005,Be careful of Cadillac Certified Vehicles,2,"This is my fifth Cadillac and will probably be my last.  It was supposed to be a Certified Pre Owned vehicle but within a week, it was in the shop for three weeks.  They had to replace the dash and auto headlights (they are still broken).  The traction control can not be turned off (they say it's a computer prob, but can't fix it), there is a pronounced vibration at over 60 mph (the shop says its a characteristic of the car and they can't fix it), and a host of other small problems.  I bought the car because it was certified and am sorely disappointed.  I always liked Cadillacs but their customer service, at least at my dealership, is horrible.  They just don't seem to care one whit.  They've sold the car now so to heck with the purchaser.  Sad, ain't it."

We purchased a 2002 replacement.  This car was good for about 35,000 miles.  Then it started using oil, had to replace 2 seat heaters, water pump, and two starters.  Since then it has been one senor after another, cruise control module, two more starters, flywheel, ball joint, etc, etc.  I will drive this until it stops to get my investment back, however I could never be compelled to purchase another Cadillac in this lifetime!  Not worth the cost outlay or the frustration level.  I have also learned Cadillac, as a company, is not concerned about its customers - horrendous experience!"

Last month at 83,000 miles, the northstar has a leaky head gasket. That'll be another $1400 plus. Sad that such an expensive car develops problems so soon.

We have had all four bearings/hubs replaced, rear shocks, pass. window switch, one tie rod end and the pwr. strg. hose has a slight leak.  Otherwise, it has been an excellent drive, smooth but have had the slight front end vibration above 60 MPH as commented by others.  Four new Yokohama tires virtually eliminated it.  Some of the dash switch lights have gone out but due to the permanent bulb design in the circuit boards, the bulbs simply cannot be replaced without a soldering iron.

That battery leaked and was recently replaced and they found a hole burned through the bottom of the car.  They also replaced the passenger window motor because the rear window dropped. The motor is making noises now. Also, the seats get stained easily. The dash instruments are hard to see due to the glare. The good things are the comfortable seats, smooth ride, quiet engine, and how there is plenty of room and trunk space. This is not a performance car my any means."

92 Deville was built such as good 
quality working visors, seats that 
cradle the body and a more comfortable 
road ride.  I also miss the exterior 
light monitors and the automatic pull 
down trunk.  The $2K Onstar system

now and although its alot of fun to

Everything from suspension problems to 
moon roof leaking. The dealer is taking 
care of the problems as they arise but 
things are breaking faster than they 
can fix them. GM needs to go back to 
the drawing board on this one. There's 
more to it than glitz and glitter."
cadillac,deville,2002,Mike, 08/20/2005,What a Ride!,5,I bought my 2002 DeVille STD Sedan on E-Bay used.  What a deal!  The car is extremely smooth.  I'm always finding an excuse to dive the Cadillac over my other cars.  It's just a fun ride!  No problems thus far.  Luxury at a fraction of the cost.  There are advantages to American cars that don't hold their value despite being built just as well as those German and Japanese cars...They are much cheaper used!

cadillac,deville,2003,Stacey Kazacos, 01/05/2016,2003 Deville -- Land Yacht,4,"I bought the Deville with about 35K miles, 7 years ago.  The car is best on a long trip when comfort and smooth highway handling count the most.  My biggest problems have been with faulty sensors -- just about all of them to include:  oil pressure, engine temp, airbag, steering, tire pressure etc.  The actual components were NOT at fault.  In every case it was the sensor.   The other problem I had (which seems to be common among owners) is the power window motor failing.     The electronic switches and displays are chintzy.   Anyway, the motor is great.  Uses about 1 quart per 1,600 miles.  All that said, it is a fun car to drive on a trip.  It depreciated quickly -- so I would shy away from buying a new one in the future.

Update on 7/6/2016:  Still have the Caddie and enjoy driving it, especially on road trips.  Unfortunately, the latest ""service engine"" light came on and provided some ugly results:  ""replace torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid.""  This is an expensive repair where the a transmission shop has to remove the transmission to replace parts.  Uggh.  In searching this repair among other Caddie owners, I am not alone.   Many, many owners have reported the same thing.  The car has just under 100K miles, has been well maintained etc.  GM knows about the recurring problems and made little/no changes to address specific and expensive problems in subsequent model years (see my original comments above).  No love here for this company -- sorry.  I will avoid buying a caddie in the future.

Every time i turn on the a/c or heat the car will shut off, even when randomly driving it shuts off. The service tire monitor light came on, fixed that only for it to come back on shortly after.

There was a horrific odor coming through my ventilation system, then  was told I had bacteria in the lines.  This needed to be disinfected.

Gas mileage is very close to EPA rating both in town and on the highway, usually 18-20 city and 24-26 highway (EPA is 18/27).

It has been many times to dealership for this or that repairs under warranty or I am paying the bill. Then the dealership damages it and won't repair unless I pay. The gm parts are expensive ($7.00 plastic retainer) and you wait for them to order them. The noise caused by the self leveling system is aggravating to hear. The car is so big and bulky that you can not maneuver it easily. The power steering is soft however. Yet that steering had to be repaired also to be soft and noiseless. The quality and workmanship is not worth the money you spend to buy. Next car I purchase will be a new one and not gm.

cadillac,deville,2003,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,Best Car Ever,4,"I've always liked caddy's, and this one is no exception. Can't believe how nice it still is and love the 275 hp engine. Everybody talks about how pretty it is. I like the vinyl top a lot also. Its the best car I've ever owned and definitely the most luxurious. I even like it better than my infiniti. In my opinion I bought the car from a car lot ran by crooks, they did not disclose things about the car I should have known before purchasing, and had to have a couple parts replaced. Still have a few more to go but at the end of the day I still really like this car more than any other. The best I test drove. My dream is to own a house and a dts platinum off the show room floor."
cadillac,deville,2003,Big Lou, 06/30/2008,Gas Crunch? Luxury and Economical Ride,4,"I bought this Cadillac a few months ago. My fear was that it was a gas guzzler as I've owned Cadillac's since the 80's.  Much to my surprise, I got 27 mpg on the highway commuting to and from work. I love the car, it's comfort and options. This car is second to none for affordability, reliability and overall fun driving. It's not Grandpa's Cadillac anymore."
cadillac,deville,2003,zipcode21804, 07/02/2008,I Love this car,4,"This is my third Cadillac and by far the best. Gas mileage could be better but hey it's a caddy. The ride is just what you would expect. I have not had a problem with the car in six months of ownership. If you are looking for a good family car, look no further than the 2003 deville. when you push on the gas this baby will get it. I was truly surprised, howbeit at four dollars a gallon I don't get on the gas to often. This is truly a highway car, but it's pretty cool for tooling around town as well. I've learned that the ladies love its style. Buy it!"
cadillac,deville,2003,mike, 10/08/2009,Cadillac Deville,3,I been a Lincoln owner for over twenty years and finally bought a Cadillac.  So far the ride and fuel economy and comfort is about the best you can get in a full size luxury car.  I am disappointed in the quailty workmanship cheap plastic on dash and cheap looking leather for the seats and rattles never had nothing like that with the Lincolns I owned.  Only had it a month now and no problems yet so can't speak on reliability hopefully it will be better then the others I have heard about.  Its strickly a highway cruiser you don't hear the rattles. It handles poorly  even for a luxury car it should handle better but i spend all my time with it on the highway so I am happy with the car so far.

Cadillac used purchases in the past, I 
was only beginning a search for a 
different vehicle.  The quality of the 
Cadillac, as well as the established

enhanced by the 0% interest, and I was 
able to select the car I did for that

cadillac,deville,2003,G-Wagon, 06/05/2019,"170,000 mile G-Wagon !",5,"I was in hard time's and just lost a vehicle too a bad friend ship , so i found a 2003 cadillac deville with 22 inch rims for a respectable price of $1,800 and i settled with the owner for $1,670 . The car had several issues but mostly the rims and tires were completely trash so i bought new rims and tires and found that the car had around 10 thousand dollars worth of work done too it ! With some TLC and alot of cleaning the car is amazing ! I've had it for 2 months and put over 3,000 miles , i absolutely love the car and it's beautiful for a large car . It does however eat about a quart and a half of oil every thousand miles and i found this is normal ( Lucas oil motor additive slows this down also improved gas mileage ) i usually get 15 too 20 miles too the gallon witch isn't bad the window switches tend too act up and lights for service engine are permanent lol but it is a strong car and i feel safe . the room inside and trunk space are insane and I'm currently looking too buy another since my girl friend has fell in love with the car lol. Again thier is alot of faults too a large car like a deville but i see more advantages in my case and line of work and living with children . i do suggest keeping a eye on the oil and coolant because these two are the most crucial thing's with the northstar v8 if they become low then kiss your caddy goodbye and don't say i didn't warn you . enjoy ! I know i am 😉 😉

cadillac,deville,2004,Dave Edwards, 07/24/2015,RICH MAN'S CAR FOR WORKING CLASS MONEY!,5,"The reality of these fine cars, is that the market has not been kind to them. But that is a good thing for a guy like me, who is on a budget, and wants a nice, classy car.  My 2004 Deville Base cost $35,000.00 + new in '04, but in March, 2015- with 107k on the odometer,  it cost me $4,000.00 out the door of the dealer, with all taxes and fees, and smog paid. I have since fixed all the things that were known issues at purchase. I put on new General Altimax RT tires, new cross drilled and vented rotors and ceramic pads all around, and a new heater blower motor. Buying all the parts on Ebay- NEW for about half the price of a local auto parts store... and my costs are at about $5,200.00  YES, I then had a driver's door window regulator failure!  EBAY- NEW AC Delco Motor, 61.50, and regulator- 30.99 Labor- 75 bucks.  The REAL reason these regulators fail, is because GM used nylon/ plastic guide wheels. If they were made of aluminum, there would have been far less problems. If you encounter regulator failures BUY ON EBAY. I've heard that dealers can charge as much as 500 bucks to replace one. After seeing my mechanic do the job, I know I could do it myself. $168 is quite reasonable, I'd say. 
A note- the dealer I bought from, was DRIVING this car from Reno, to Tahoe daily.... because he dug it that much.
Now, it's my turn.
This car, is by far, the most classically 'handsome' Cadillac of the last 30 years, in my opinion. It handles like a sloth. I don't like that so much, as I drove high performance cars all my life. That said-  the great angry song of the Northstar V-8 when you 'get on it' is a joy to hear! 
Mileage so far has been as 'bad' as 18.0 city, and as good as 23+ highway. Haven't taken it on a long highway trip yet. It is about the same as my Nissan Pathfinder. HEY!  I bought a Cadillac, not a friggin' hippie Prius! 
I'm a very big man- 6'-2"" and large framed. This is the most comfortable, roomy car I've ever owned. I'm also a bass player. My whole rig, two small speaker cabinets, two bass guitars and stands, a seat, and an amp head fit in the trunk, no problem.
I drove this car from Reno to Elko, a four hour trip, both ways, if you do over 80 mph. I did. got 23 mpg., and felt like  I was gliding over the road.  I now have 117k on it.  The driver's side window regulator just failed again! These are just poorly designed units. and apparently, the aftermarket ones are, too.. unless it's something else. I ordered a new regulator. 30 bucks. The motor sounds like it's still working. Left rear door window and locks are inoperative. All the motors and module work fine. It is a short in the harness somewhere. Makes no sense, as the rear doors hardly ever get used. It doesn't affect me, I never need to unlock (I can still do it manually) or roll down that window.  I still love the car. A really nice ride.

Almost two years owning this nice car, and the drivers window regulator failed again. This is a known issue with these on this model.  use that door anyway. The other issue is I had to replace the oil pressure switch. I mentioned above-  took this car to Elko, Nevada, from Reno, about a year ago, four hours there... and then back home to Reno a week later. Much of that trip is a 75 mph. speed limit. The car actually achieved 23 mpg. And that, is at 80+ mph! The comfort level has remained as it was when I got it, big, roomy, quiet, and very pleasant to drive. These cars are still very reasonable to purchase and own/ maintain. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another 2004+ model if the need arose.  The city mileage varies, according to trip length, and my driving style. Observed is lower than my time of purchase... It is mainly used in the city right now- showing 16.9. 
Still a nice ride.
Four years of ownership.... wow time flies! Still have the 'dead' rear door issue... and the power steering pump bearing went out- made a clicking
 noise.. Replaced it. Not too much money- but the system needs to be bled of air. Still it is a really nice, smooth and comfortable ride. When the time comes- I will be buying another one. Later model... but another Cadillac DeVille for sure.
August, 2019... still driving it. 131k on it now, I have another car- a Subaru, to get around the sometimes VERY snowy and icy roads here in the Reno/ Tahoe area. The caddy is simply too low to the ground to be useful in anything but rain and light snow.
Still have the bad rear left door. But a mechanic told me the issue could be in the front door harness. When I have time, I'll look for it. Still rides great, and runs excellent! I have NOT even changed the plugs in this car yet! I still love it. I was looking up some things for this car online, the list price for it was something even higher- I thought it was 45k, but, it was $56k list, new! I don't think they actually sold these at that price. Still, a lot of car for the money.

cadillac,deville,2004,archielmj, 03/14/2015,Keeper,4,"Bought this sparkling mint charcoal 04 Deville in 2009 for 45% of what it cost new with 55,000 km on it and  had never seen rain.
Deep tinted passenger and rear window and put on a Corsa aftermarket exhaust to give it a sexy look and sound.
5 yrs later, ive changed the oil, put on a new set of Michelins and kept it garaged.
I love cruising in safety and style and this big ol' caddy gives me that.
I can't imagine selling it since it wouldn't bring much, and to replace this level of luxury and comfort without laying out large money isn't going to happen.
There is something to be said for the looks and manners of this 11 yr old car, and will likely keep it for another 10 years or more."

Northstar V8 has plenty of power and gets decent fuel economy on the highway. Stereo is great and has plenty of power. Tons of rear seat and trunk space as well... Wow!

Test drove Impalas, Lucernes, Lexus ES and finally this Caddy. Hands down the best family car for the money (especially used). Huge but still handles nicely. Cavernous trunk, very low noise and exceptional stability means great road trip material for the family. Northstar provides great highway performance and very good gas mileage (22-23mpg).

A couple of issues with window regulators and electrical shorts (all fixed under warranty) marred the otherwise great reliability and consistency. GM better not discontinue this one!"

I love the ride and responsive handling for a big car, the getup and go is great, when it is in cruise control you are literally floating on the road. We have driven this car down south a few times and there is not too many nicer cars to take a trip in and it averaged pretty close to 27.5 mpg.

This is a great car in all areas. The northstar is a terrific engine. For a large car it handles well. I love all the gadgets it has. Heated and cooled seats.

It even has massaging leather heated front seats! The performance of this car is amazing. When you drive this car down the road, people notice you.

Powerful engine delivers smooth acceleration; transmission shifts without jerks (no hunting like the Lexus or Avalon).  Bose stereo is just the best.  Mileage on the highway is 29.5, while city depends on whether it's warmed up: 16 cold for short trips, 18 warm.  Daytime headlights were annoying - had to remove fuse to disable.  Nav has helped a lot in strange towns. Occasional whine from a DC-DC in dash. Use the heated/cooled seats a lot. Pearl paint is tops!"

cadillac,deville,2004,Scotty1927, 01/08/2017,Beautiful Machine,4,"I love old Caddy's and Elvis because my dad loved old Caddy's and Elvis.  Now they are obsessions.  Just picture this, since my children refuse to, a black Caddy with black carriage roof, Gold Package, polished chrome wheels with gold Cadillac emblems, and Vogue Tyres.  It don't get no better!  George Jones, Pasty Cline, Conway Twitty, and Ray Price sound even better when I am cruising in that old car.  The car is mobile art.  An object of beauty and grace.     Having said all that there are some real concerns.  If you whisper ""head gasket"" I will break into a cold sweat.  She is running Mobile 1 and I have no money for repairs.  Windows are for looking out of, NOT rolling down.  Nylon window components have a horrible reputation.  The brakes don't always seem quite up to the task.  The paint is flaking off of the radio and climate controls.  It's the first thing I see when I get in the car and I cannot believe it.  As much as I love Cadillac, GM went belly up for a reason.  FWD doesn't make sense for this car.  Too much weight up front and the turning radius is bigger than a cul-de-sac.  The car actually feels downsized to me.  Not nearly as much room as my 1993 Fleetwood Brougham and certainly nothing like my 1995 Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon.  I hate to see these cars disappear.  Some of the new Cadillac's are four cylinder.   They are shaped like beans and look like my wife's 1987 Accord.  Play some Haggard.  I need a drink.

Anyway - love my Caddy - a couple of reliability quirks including window and heated/cooled seat problems but they were all covered under the decent warranty. GM's OEM Brakes still stink too but that's easily improved once changed out. Exceptional comfort, safety, security and power are what this great family sedan is all about. Recommended."
cadillac,deville,2004,Jason A, 06/15/2009,Best Luxury car for the money,4,"I bought this Car about 6 to 7 months ago when the gas prices were around $ 3.50 to 4 bucks a gallon. So not alot of people wanted this car because it doesnt get the best gas mileage. All I have owned is cadillacs, I love them. They don't hold there value well but you can pick them up at a good price if you really look around. I paid $7,000 total for mine with taxes. at the time its high book value was  $11,500. The car does have a little over 100,000 miles but you can't tell by looking at it. For a big car that weighs alot this car will get up and fly, the ride is of course very comfortable. For the money you can't go wrong if you want a big, fast, and luxurious car, That is fun to drive."
cadillac,deville,2004,Scott Matthews, 11/05/2005,My DTS,5,"I believe these sedans are very underrated. I love my DTS! The only things I would change: I would make an AWD version and the front cup holder (when flipped out) blocks the shifter from shifting into 1st gear. Last week I drove a 2006 DTS, loaded to the hilt. I can actually say I like the interior of my 2004 much better than the 2006. I do like the changes outside for 2006 though."

I was a Honda man for the past 13 yrs,  but after experiencing a deville I'm not ever riding in another Honda again,  unless it's to go buy another Cadillac and I need a ride to pick it up LOL."

However, the flagship Mercedes-Benz is my absolute favorite this DeVille is a better value dollar- for-dollar-bang-for-the-buck. Yeah. DeVille stinks on initial resale, but I knew that going into this purchase. This is why I buy off-lease, certified Devilles. I travel 65000+- annually and would love to have the fuel economy of a Toyota Prius. However, that is the only improvement I can think of for my 2004 Deville DHS.

This car fails each catagory.  The Michelin tires are the wrong tire for this car.  They wear poorly and are virtually impossible to balance properly.  If the car has a problem they can't fix, they treat you like the plague instead of admitting the problem - a fatal GM flaw.  Engine is totally underpowered. It does get good gas mileage."

In the short time I've owned it, I've found it to be comfortable, fun to drive and surprisingly economical.  I average 29 mpg highway (around 18 city).  The NorthStar V8 & trans are smooth and quite.  While I'm not sure I would have paid $40k + for this car four years ago, the poor re-sale value puts it in a class by itself for a used car!  I will own other Cadillac's in the future.  I'm also fond of the '08 CTS & DTS.  However, the new STS styling needs to be bolder."

How can you beat that! It is very comfortable, decent mileage, great acceleration. I love it. My only complaints are that the radio sucks and I wish the seat went back a couple of inches more. I have had a couple of repairs but not bad. Hopefully the dependability will continue over time. I mean this car is 13 years old.

I have all the Records and this car cost $49,000 to the Original buyer and well to me its still ""Like New"" so there you have it....I never buy brand new car because of this reason.   The resale value is not good but buy used and save tons of money.

cadillac,deville,2005,Paul, 07/18/2006,First DeVille,4,This is our first Cadillac. We purchased it as a certified pre-owned car at a reasonable price. The warranty and the car have more than exceeded our expectations.
cadillac,deville,2005,John, 10/18/2018,The Everyman's American V8 Luxury Sedan,5,"Hello All, I hope you find this review helpful, if not too long! I bought this car after my previous car, a 2006 Chrysler 300, was totalled in a highway pileup (too many bad drivers out there). I bought the Deville for $3,000 with 96,000 miles on it - it was finally time. It was a one-owner, owned by an older gentleman who only took it for service to the dealer he bought it from in '05, a HUGE plus and reassurance. I had been craving a V8-powered American sedan for years, and this one won me over. It may be the finest example of a car of my craving for the price. First, a few impressions on the engine, transmission and ride. The engine is the famed Northstar V8, which in this base trim level provides 275 horsepower and 300 (!) lb. ft. of torque. The engine is an absolute gem, it has fantastic power, sounds awesome, and gets very good fuel economy for a V8 (I get 22.5 mpg mostly highway). It is famed for these good traits, but also for some bad ones too, unfortunately. All Northstars are known to be oil burners; mine has yet to need a top-off (in about a month of ownership), but I know most need to be watched with the eye of a hawk, as they can burn oil very fast. Secondly, and more seriously, these engines are infamous for blowing head gaskets, which lead to repairs that can cost anywhere from $2,000 up to even $3,500+. The problem is not the gasket itself, but the head bolts, which often pull out of the aluminum block, lifting the gaskets and causing overheating. 1997-1999 Northstars are by far the worst, stay away at all costs. 2000 saw a lengthening of the head bolts, which helped some. Your best bet is a 2005 or newer Northstar, as these head bolts were not only lengthened, but also had a coarser thread that virtually fixed the issue. Get a 2005+ if possible!! It is well worth it, what an engine. Make sure you flush your coolant at least once a year, to help keep the engine running cool and increase life. The transmission is a 4-speed, which is adequate. Its pretty reliable as long as you treat it well. The car could be infinitely better with a 5- or 6-speed (for fuel economy and performance), but the 4-speed is good enough for a car like this. And the ride - oh man, THE RIDE. It is far and away the best part of the experience. You simply waft down the road. It's incredible. Stepping inside the cab, your comfort experience is further increased with incredibly comfortable leather seats, wood-grain trim, and solid, durable construction that pleases the eye as well as the hand. My Deville is the base model, but strangely, it came loaded with basically every option minus Night Vision, fog lights and stability control. It has heated and cooled power memory seats (front and back are heated, only front seats cooled), sunroof, OnStar, Sirius XM, heated steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, auto headlights, CD, the works. The seats are supremely comfortable, and the heated seat function is terrific (3 levels of heat). The car comes with 4 power outlets, 2 front, 2 back. There is a vast amount of room as well, tons of space for 5 adults. The radio, cruise control and Driver Information Center controls are intuitive, with many controls on the steering wheel. The fit and finish is excellent. The trunk is also HUGE - the Mafia jokes never cease! There are a few minor complaints, however. The climate controls are a annoying - the buttons are not intuitive at all. I may be old-school, but dials work so well for fan speed and zone - why switch to an up-down button (for both) to navigate? And also, when you press the A/C button, the light indicator ""A/C off"" turns on, and shuts off on a second press. Why not say ""A/C on?"" Too confusing! If the icon isn't lit, I believe the A/C is on, if it is lit, the A/C is off, still not sure! Why do this GM?? Second, the battery is NOT in the engine bay, nor in the trunk - its under the
 rear seat. Yes, that's right! Definitely not a hazard! Typical of 2000's GM.I sure hope there is no leak of any sort - talk about heated seats! The only other thing I can think of is the lack of stability control as standard. I believe every Cadillac should have it standard. All in all, this is a fantastic buy for the price - you simply won't get more for less. It's been problem-free so far. Make sure to have some $$ set aside for potential repairs, but if you can find a low-mileage example, I don't know why you wouldn't pull the trigger. If you dream of Uncle Sam, 8 cylinders, La-Z-Boys and room for all your friends, you can't go wrong here! What a car!

cadillac,deville,2005,merlincat, 01/21/2009,American Dream,5,"Bought out of an estate sale with only 24k on it. Virtually new 4 year old car. It's every thing a Caddy should be. Heavy, big, roomy, plush, and you can get 4 bodies in the trunk.It gives you that aaahhhh feeling at 80 floating down the interstate. She gets almost 29 mi/gal on cruise at 80 and that's in the Rockies at 7000 ft! So sad the big Caddys are going away for BMW size posers. I imagine they are fine cars but the American dream sled will be another thing we Americans did really well and quit. Got caught in a Colorado blizzard and the heavy 350 sitting over the front wheel drive made her move like an Abrahms tank through the snow. Amazing. If you can find a clean one, buy it!"

The engine is now burning oil to the tune of a quart every 100 miles or so.  I have found other owners who have the same complaint and it looks like I will have to take it in for an overhaul.  It only has 45,000 miles on it and yet it uses this much oil.  There is no leakage nor smoking that I can see.  I don't think we will ever buy another Cadillac."

I got it with 16,000 miles on it, and it drives and looks like the day it rolled off the showroom floor. The price was great ($ 18,500 on a car that stickered for approx $57k 3 years ago), partially due to it not being the most recent body style, but it has every option with the exception of navigation. American cars have really come a long way, and I hope that more people will start to realize it and not choose foreign solely because of the prestige factor."

The city mileage could use some help.  The only complaint I have is with the poor design of the seatbelts.  I am a short person (5'5"") and I find that the seatbelt hits me across the neck.  It is not adjustable, as it comes out of the top side of the seats.  They work fine for my husband, but he is 6'4"".  In other cars we have owned, you had a slide feature to raise or lower the seatbelt.  I have raised my seat, but that is not enough to help.  This could be a safety issue if you are in an accident.

I've had it custom made with power folding mirrors, a power rear sunshade, adaptive cruise control, xenon headlamps with intellibeam, and adaptive remote start. This luxury liner cost me near $72,000, but it was worth every cent.  It drives great and filters out the bumps on the New York City streets.  It is quiet, roomy, and gives great gas mileage for a V8.  I got it in white lightning exterior paint. I'm gonna keep it for a looong time."

The seat does not rise high enough for me to see well over the dash.  The back of my seat periodically folds back to a horizontal position without my desiring it to do so.  This is my 5th Caddy and, by far, it is the worst I ever owned.  The driver's seat belt root is too far in the midline so that when you want to strap yourself in you find that your back is laying on the belt and you have to twist yourself to get it.  As an older driver (77 y.o.) this is a contortion that is uncomfortable. The gear shift indicators are too small and almost impossible to read."

Warning # 2 Check via your car VIN to be sure car doesn't have ""Stiff suspension option"". Apparently a purchase option. Makes for poor rough ride.

cadillac,deville,2005,reginaumbras, 05/20/2020,Awesome First Car,4,"My great-aunt gave me this car in 2015 when she stopped driving. I had previously driven my mom's Toyota Avalon and 1998 Suburban, so driving an extremely long sedan was not a problem for me. I could even parallel park it if I needed to, but getting out of tight spots required multiple point turns. When I first got the car she rode like a dream. Smoothest, softest ride I've ever experienced, and low road noise. She loved going fast and I got pulled over for going 86 mph on a highway because I didn't realize how fast I was going! I never got her mpg over 26 on road trips and it hovered around 13 in the city, which was not ideal. Fortunately the big gas tank meant not having to fill up too often. She was absolutely a road trip car. During the four years I had her, I spent about 200 hours putting about 16,000 miles on her in road trips alone. She got me safely between Georgia, Ohio, and Texas every time I had to travel. I found the seats extremely comfortable (5'7"", 140lb) and took good care of the leather so it never cracked. Some of my heavier passengers found the passenger seat belt uncomfortable and hard to use. The trunk is massive and I was able to fit almost everything I owned into the trunk and back seat the multiple times I moved in this car.

In 2017, I had owned the car for two years. I was driving on a four-lane road and a truck merged into my lane. I swerved to avoid a collision, but I was going 60 mph and the car couldn't correct fast enough. I lost control and fishtailed down the road before hitting a telephone pole on the shoulder. Thank goodness I was in this heavy car, otherwise I might have flipped and had a much worse accident. The rear quarter panel, rear bumper, and rear passenger door were destroyed along with the rear axle and one of the tires. Because the car was under 100k miles and everything under the hood was working fine at the time, my mom's mechanic purchased a junk car and repaired mine with its parts. From the outside you could not tell the difference, but she never rode as smooth after that.

At some point during the 2018/2019 school year the air conditioner stopped working completely, which made for an uncomfortable drive from Texas to Ohio in May 2019. When I was almost to my destination in Ohio, the car overheated while I was sitting idle in a parking lot. I managed to get where I was going, but once I got the car to a shop I found out that there was a leak in the head gasket. Repairing it would have cost much more than the car was worth, since the engine would have to be removed. The entire air conditioning system needed replacing as well, so I sold the car for parts to the mechanic.

If you're looking to buy a car like this, look at the maintenance history. The head gasket leak is a known issue with the North Star engines used in Devilles from 2005 and earlier. If it's already been repaired, the car is probably solid. But if it hasn't happened yet it is only a matter of time, and you'll be stuck with a car you can't use without shelling out more money than it's worth. Otherwise, it's a great car to drive and is very spacious."
cadillac,deville,2005,Joe, 08/28/2017,Do Not Buy This Car,1,"Worst car I have ever owned.  Leaks oil, transmission fluid.  It is one repair after another.  You fix one problem and then another problem happens.  If you like to constantly fix your car then this is the car for you.  Very nice car if you can keep it out of the repair shop and on the road.

I finally have everything fixed and the car is running great.  I love the car now but there was a lot of pain to get to this point.  Great car once you get it going.

The ride is supremely quiet, and the seats are comfortable, although a bit on the firm side (I prefer the seats in my previous Lincoln Mark 8).

I feel safe and comfortable in this car.  All the bells and whistles work well.  MY complaint is that you can't program the navigation system when the car is moving.  So if you're on the freeway, you have to pull off if you want to impute a destination.  My mileage - in city driving only (I've never taken it more than 70 miles from home) is about 17 to 18.

cadillac,deville,2005,FRED, 01/15/2005,2005 Cadillac Deville,4,"I am disappointed that the seat belt height control was eliminated in the Cadillac Deville.  The base stereo system is not of good quality. I have recieved much better reception on radios with telescoping antenas. GM keeps eliminating nice features, but raising the price. "
cadillac,deville,2005,Motley Crue Freak, 02/19/2005,New Cadillac Fan!,5,"Wow the 2005 Cadillac DeVille is simply beautiful and so powerful. After driving Lincolns that broke down all the time, I decided to look at Cadillac because everyone kept telling me they were awesome. And It's true I test drove a Cadillac a few hours ago and wow, compared to Cadillac, Lincoln is a joke.  The DeVille has a smoother ride, better materials, and is well worth purchasing. Now I'm in love with Cadillac.  No wonder so many people buy them, because they are nice cars and are very reliable.  I will never drive anything else, no other car compares to it."
cadillac,deville,2005,Mike Rodgers, 03/11/2005,Thoughts,4,"Traveling on the open road in my 2005 Cadillac DeVille is like riding on air, even on California roads. The fuel milage for this big a car has been around 25 mpg, highway and 17 mpg in town. the interior could be nicer for the cost. The headlights are bright, but don't seem to light the road as well as they should. The front end is low and drags when entering some driveways. Overall, the car is very nice to drive."
cadillac,deville,2005,Tots, 03/18/2005,"Luxury, handling, performance....",5,"When I purchased my 2005 Cadillac DeVille I wasn't sure if I was making the correct decision, but after having it for the past two years it has been a blast.  The car has had no problems.  Cadillac has really caught up to other luxury brands in terms of style, functionality, speed, performace, and luxury....way to go "
cadillac,deville,2005,robert vaticalos, 03/22/2005,Dream Car,4,"My 2005 Cadillac DeVille is the best car that I have ever owned in the sence that its technology seems to be state of the art.  It provides great comfort as well as proformance. Furthermore, the many options make this car a pleasure to drive and use. Finally, its styling of is sleek and very beautiful."
cadillac,deville,2005,Thomas Bellovary, 08/04/2017,Classy Chassy,4,"This is a very comfortable car to drive and being seen in. It is a heavy well built car and should protect its passengers should there ever be an accident.

cadillac,deville,2005,Aidan G., 05/14/2019,05 Cadillac Deville,4,"This is an outstanding car. Not as luxurious as either the Cadillac's of the past nor the Cadillac's of today but still a great overall vehicle. Very smooth ride, much like high end Mercedes as well as older Cadillac's. The material is great, with comfortable leather and wood interior design. However there is a bit to much use of plastic in the interior. The cargo space in unbelievable. The trunk is very spacious and there is plenty of head space and leg room for backseat passengers. Exterior design is classy and respectably Cadillac. When traveling at high speeds the car tends to shake, and when braking while going down a steep hill the steering wheel shakes as well. Very good audio quality, the car is very disconnected from outside noises. Overall a very superb car.

cadillac,dts,2006,chris tillett, 10/12/2015,40000 miles not good,3,"1st off, what a beautiful car, comfy, decent mpg! But, this car was always serviced at a Cadillac dealership, at 38000 miles breaking system complete rebuild, not as good as new ! Then both valve cover gaskets, front seat electronics. At 39000, all seals in lower engine replaced at 40000 mile service! Big expense ! Very nice car, but, are you telling me a Lexus , Mercedes or competitive luxury car would need this??  I no longer trust this car as reliable, but, is pretty. My 4th Cadillac , shame that Cadillac doesn't have reliability for price. Prestige not worth it

cadillac,dts,2006,JimM, 10/18/2006,2006 DTS Review,4,"I truly love my DTS. Its exterior design is great for me.  Its interior comfort / design are also very nice. My wife loves the seats and interior layout. I had to take into the dealer two times, once for air noise in the sunroof and once when the windshield washer didn't work. Both were easy fixes, but a car that is less than one year old, shouldnt have problems. ITs gas milage is just OK, I average 22.8 mpg in mixed hwy/city driving. The engine does rock when needed and the ride is smooth and comfortable."
cadillac,dts,2006,bsdtwd, 06/19/2011,"DTS Luxury III, Total Comfort at reasonable price",4,"Bought mine gently used with 23,000 miles. Just off lease. Has everything but distronic style cruise. My wife loves the cooled seats and massage. Just had heated windshield fluid option disabled due to recall. Worked well. Got $100 back from GM. I replaced the third brake light on trunk lid. LED's were going out and I discovered issue as I replaced it. The first screw, of seven, was over torqued during manufacture and let water into the led housing. You must replace entire unit. About $125.00. I see lots of DTS's with same issue. New one works well. Only other repair was front wheel hub/bearing. Rough winter/potholes in Ohio. A great car, fantastic ride and the last of the big ones. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Steve, 12/01/2015,Great car but,5,"I have had this car for about 18 months and bought it used.  It has needed some repairs but for a 10 year old car what do you expect.  Other than 12 mpg fuel economy, but being the performance model with a big V-8 and a 4000 pounds and mostly city driving  I guess 12 mpg is not too bad I can not really find anything to complain about with this car.  I have the performance model and for a 4000 pound car it has great get up and go.  Plenty of room in this car and living in PA it was great in the snow with Michelin tires on it.  This having been almost 60,000.00 dollars for this car new you would expect nice things from it.  I recently looked at a new Toyota Avalon XLE premium and it still cant compare to this Cadillac.  I was going to trade in the Cadillac for a brand new car but can't find one reason why I would want to give up this DTS.

cadillac,dts,2006,chief07, 02/16/2012,Great Car with Some Exceptions,4,"I just recently purchased 2006 Dts with 60k on it got it for only 12,000. This car was babied all its life. Anyways, It is very comfortable and reliable to drive. The only issue I am having is a slow leak in my front pass tire and the hub/wheel bearing is making my abs/traction lights go nuts while im driving. Other than that the car starts up everytime and drives as smooth as can be. Also my driver headlight flickers on and off. The new dts is more stylish and sleek and the interior is beautiful...if anyone knows why my abs/traction lights go nuts let me know. I replaced the front pads and rotors when I purchased and thats the only repaid I had to do so far!!"
cadillac,dts,2006,overlandbpc, 04/19/2013,Rides like a Caddy,4,"This is my 7th cadillac. A fine American car. I do question if you guys know what trim level your car is. Most of you are Luxury III, or Performance???? I didn't think they made that many with those trims. Might want to check your trim level again. 1sd is a Luxury III There were only 11,146 of those built. Far fewer Performance were built 1se is the performance package. Anyhow it's a great car. Reliable, fast, and smooth. I've owned the car now for 6 years and have put a little over 50k on it without an issue. Japanese/German cars are over rated. If your an American buy something made here. Keep jobs here. Our cars were built by good Americans in Hamtramck Michigan"
cadillac,dts,2006,Duke, 02/04/2010,It's so nice,5,I bought my 06 DTS as a program car with 17K on it.  I've had it for over 3 years and I absolutely love it.  My gas mileage on the highway nears 30 MPG. It's very comfortable and drives like a dream.  The cooled seats are a blessing in the New Mexico summers.  This is my 4th Caddy and I'll buy more.
cadillac,dts,2006,JACK HUDDER, 06/03/2006,Tetirement,5,"The DTS is very comfortable on long drives. I love the remote start so the car can be cooled down before entering. I'm surprised with the good gas milage. It is better than the Acura RL that we traded in.  Also, it burns regular fuel not premium.  We like the monthly reminders from OnStar. Any questions after purchase were promtly answered."
cadillac,dts,2006,B Rivard, 06/14/2019,Cadillac isn't What It Used To Be,1,"I bought this 2006 Cadillac DTS brand new from the dealership.  I don't drive much so even though it is a 2006, it only has 38,000.  I just took it in because of the vehicle leaking oil.  After two visits to the dealership, they determined they would have to take the engine out in order to fix the seal - to the tune of $4,000.  When I contacted Cadillac (corporate), they were aware of the problem but refused to do anything about it.  According to my research, this is a known problem for model years 2006/2007/2008/2009.  This is my ninth Cadillac (new) so you could say that I have been a loyal customer for years.  There will not be a 10th Cadillac.

cadillac,dts,2006,John, 12/28/2006,2006 DTS Potential Buyers Beware,4,"I love the car and the way it handles. You just can't beat the ride of a Cadillac, but...buyer beware. They do not retain their value at all. I was going to trade it in after one year to take advantage of Cadillac's recent incentives and the dealer had the nerve to only offer me $24,000 trade in on a car that I paid $55,000 for. I would never buy another one based on the extremely poor value retention. You'd be better off to look at an Audi or a BMW, something that will maintain it's value more"
cadillac,dts,2006,JONES199, 08/13/2008,Embarrassed,4,"I am embarrassed I like this car do much.  Looks great, mileage is surprising, the cooled seats are off the chart.  My friends all make fun of me for driving the ""old man's car"" until they rise in it.  I now get stuck driving lots of places.  The Cadillac dealership however could learn from the high end imports. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Jumper, 12/07/2009,Wow! Mine is great!,5,I am surprised to read these problems! My DTS is awesome! I have never had nothing but a marvelous ownership! My 06 DTS is so nice. Never had any problems. I did buy it new though. This is my second Caddy. The last was an SLS. It too was a marvelous ride! 
cadillac,dts,2006,J STUART, 08/20/2010,Wadda car,5,"I drove Cadillacs as demos for years. Finally bought my own 2006 DTS, It did not disappoint at all. I am loving it. The remote start here in AZ cools it down before you drive. Seats that heat/cool and rub your back. The world looks different through this windshield. Road trip!"
cadillac,dts,2006,CodyC, 10/16/2010,New Caddy Owner...and Luvin It,5,"This is my first Caddy, but I absolutely love driving this. I previously owned a Chrysler Concorde LXi...loved that car. But, I could end up loving this Caddy more. Large trunk is what attracted me, but I took this one for a test drive and WOW. THE MOST comfortable ride I have ever had. It comes with every gadget: Nav, DVD, XM, BOSE sound, dual AC/Heat controls, separate rear temp control, front/rear parking sensors, rain-sense wipers, V8 performance, good hwy gas mileage, exception lighting features, soft leather seats. Luvin It."
cadillac,dts,2006,Dennis, 01/31/2016,more bang for your buck,4,"We bought this car when it was two years old, with 7,358 miles on it; paid 40% of what it sold for new. It's been an excellent highway cruiser ... still gets compliments on it's appearance, comfortable ride and quietness.. The low profile tires make for zippy cornering, but our previous Cadillacs had taller tires that gave an even better ride ... too bad hot-dogging sells vehicles these days ... all the TV ads show cars being driven as if they are toys, expensive macho playthings instead of transportation.

Second review, 5,000 miles later: If they made this same car now and added some of the newer safety features I'd buy one right now. But I haven't seen anything that temps me. Eleven years old with almost 68K on it and going strong; just finished a 2100+ mile trip that required snow tires across the Rockies: piece of cake.

I got breaks done once a year because break pads just wore out. I had to replace tires every 10k miles. Stability track warning light always came on. Continuous problems with arm bars and tire rods.
Gas guzzler.
Arm rest broke.
Overall just a cheaply made care...Not impressed. Glad I bought a Lexus this time.
Service at Caddy is bad and fails to compare to Lexus.
Never again."
cadillac,dts,2006,Tim, 05/09/2010,Nice Build,4,"I looked at this car not really intending to buy a Cadillac. I've owned many domestic and foreign cars and rate this as one of the better vehicles I've owned. The build quality is excellent. The motor performs as it should and has a nice exhaust note under acceleration. The Bridgestone tires leave much to be desired however, there are few choices of Mfg. for tires of this size. The Yokahoma Advan S.4 look like a better option. Torque steer is manageable however if your driving becomes to0 spirited I could see where this could get one into trouble. I would like to see better sway bars on this car I think it would greatly improve its handling even though it is very good for a two ton car. "
cadillac,dts,2006,dad7159, 03/22/2010,Great Ride,4,Although you can buy more premium cars with the price you can't beat the Caddy.  I am 50 and do not consider this an old man's car.  Drives Great quiet and smooth!
cadillac,dts,2006,RobW64, 07/14/2006,Outstanding Luxury Vehicle,4,"I purchased a black DTS after researching new vehicles for about a year. This is a gorgeous vehicle that turns heads everywhere we go. My co-workers who own Lexus, Jaguars, and Acuras are begging to drive it. Although the dealership told me I'm probably one of the youngest DTS buyers they've ever had (I'm 41), a few test drives by us ""middle-agers"" and the vehicle would sell itself."

cadillac,dts,2006,Daniel, 12/07/2019,Last of a Dying Breed,5,"If your a true car enthusiast you’ll appreciate the DTS for truly what it is, which is the last true “old school” American luxury cruiser of the modern age along with the now also discontinued Lincoln town car. This Cadillac has the NorthStar V8 and boy have I done my research! I knew that owning this vehicle meant staying strictly up to date with maintenance and no not because of the NorthStar engine but because it begs (needs) to be taken care of in order to keep that same awesome reliability mixed with the unique driving feel. That being said, the NorthStar is a powerful smooth engine that is extremely reliable yet very underrated (06-11 model years) and has only one purpose... To deliver a perfect comfortable ride. Those who claim to have had major problems with the DTS (06-11 model years) just didn’t know how to properly maintain the vehicle & that’s just facts. Keyword, research! Don’t take anyone else’s word for it! 
"
cadillac,dts,2006,Ted K, 03/08/2020,A CLASSIC - Beautifully designed & well engineered,5,"The 2000-2011 Devilles and DTS cars were probably the last Cadillacs that were thoughtfully engineered with intuitive ergonomics.  The windows are deep and there's plenty of headroom - even in the back seat.  The visibility in all directions is excellent.  Everything is logically designed - You do NOT need a 200 page user manual to figure out every function and feature the car offers.  The big V8 engine is powerful and throaty and will still deliver about 28MPG on the highway at 65mph.  The seats are comfortable and well shaped - front and back.  The HID headlights and fog lights are the best.  There are even cornering lights to show you what you are turning into at night.   The ride is smooth but firm.  Handling is quick and responsive.   

I have been trying out newer Cadillac CTS and CT6 models lately and the only thing they are better at is reduced road noise.   That's it.   Visibility on the new Caddys is greatly compromised and the interior space in the rear is not as good - especially the headroom.  The new ones are also rather gaudy with those flowing tear headlights.

At 14 years old, my DTS still looks great and drives like new.   Big, comfortable and easy to drive.    The car has been a pleasure to own and I had planned on turning it over to our 18 year old son but he simply doesn't have the maturity or interest to become a responsible driver so I will be selling to someone else to have and enjoy.

cadillac,dts,2006,Lloyd, 08/31/2008,2006 DTS Performance Sedan,4,"The DTS is very easy to own and operate requiring minimal maintenance as scheduled.

cadillac,dts,2006,judy, 02/01/2009,Great Car,4,"Purchased this vehicle after having a 20002 Cadillac with only 60,000.  Really liked the styling. A problem that I continue to have is the tire monitoring system.  Had 2 sensors replaced and am having problems again. Just cannot keep the sensors operating properly. Only other problem was the electrical system went dead one day. Overall, a lovely car to drive. I get very good gas mileage (27-29) on long trips. In town, normally 20-21. Love the car."
cadillac,dts,2006,Jim, 06/28/2007,Assessing the 2006 Cadillac DTS,4,"I thoroughly enjoy the car in almost every aspect. It has lots of zip and yet is classy. The interior is nicely laid out with plenty of room. The seats are comfortable. I don't use the remote start much, but in the winter it is nice to have. I thoroughly enjoy the XM radio. Like drugs, it is extremely addictive. I cannot live without it now. I have since installed it in my second car and when I replace that, I will get XM radio in the new car."
cadillac,dts,2006,oscar, 01/09/2008,worst car ever and service,2,"worst car ever, I'v had my car for 2 years.12 times back in dealer for all kinds of electrical problems, transmission, drive train, suspension was out at 30000 miles and dealership manager said that everything is normal, same was with transmission at 5K miles car was jerking ,the gear change was wery rough,  and again I was told by the service manager ,everything is normal, it took 6 trips to the dealer and and 40K miles later to make the dealer look at the problem again and finally figure it out.My advice for potential cadilac DTS buyer: If you are planning to buy the car for driving ,not sitting in a garage, please buy different car , You'll save yourself a lot of nerves,honestly!!!!"
cadillac,dts,2006,NORTHSTAR GUY, 10/20/2009,NOT YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BOAT,4,Just traded my 04 Deville - which I loved but wanted to upgrade. The 06 DTS is chock full of features and is tuned much differently than the previous model. Feels more Euro and has a throatier exhaust and more road feel. Seats are way more supportive.

What is the problem with GM? They cannot get it right.  The looks are ok, but all the accessories are screwed up. Upon exit the tilt wheel will not retreat and tilt upward fully, and when you unlock the doors it returns to driving position, so much for memory. This thing sucks gas like a Cadillac dealer trying to get your money. Wish I had bought the Lexus or Mercedes-Benz. Cadillacs are notorious for poor resale values and now I am stuck with the gas guzzling great white behemoth from GM. Oh, I forgot to mention that the fuel door is accessible to anyone."
cadillac,dts,2006,wnelson, 03/09/2007,Problem with Battery Recharger,3,"My vehicle is 14 months old (5,350 miles) and when driven, it's a dream.  However,  one day after 11 months of driving, it would not start in mid-town NY.  It was then ""repaired"" by a dealer.  One and a half months later, the same thing happened.  Again, it was repaired (it took 5 days) by the same dealer.  Last night, after midnight (less than 3 months from ""Repair Job #2), it wouldn't start again.  The motor didn't even turn over.  Then, 40 minutes later, it started up!  This lack of reliability is insane and is the reason that I'm getting rid of an otherwise great looking/driving automobile. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Harry, Irvine,I Actually Just Drove This New 2006 DTS!,4,"I just drove the DTS at a dealer introduction drive in Irvine CA so I know what I am talking about. I was able to test drive this car even though I do not work for any dealer or GM. Cadillac has made many major new improvements with this car that goes way beyond just a re design of the front and rear exterior.  The glass is thicker and laminated, with new structureless windshield wipers and many other body improvements to reduce outside noise.  The improved suspension absorbs bumps better. This car now drives even smoother than the 2005 Lexus LS430! The DTS interior/exterior looks and feels more luxurious. DTS now competes better with the LS430! It even has new adaptive radar cruise control. "
cadillac,dts,2006,GARYSL, 09/21/2009,Will buy again,4,"I bought my DTS Performance with much trepidation after years of Toyotas and Volvos. After almost 4 years with the exception of the brakes and gas mileage I couldn't be happier. Other than a very minor complaints this car has been exceptional! I have read many complaints about the factory tires and after 37,000. miles mine are just fine with regular rotation and correct pressures I believe they will easily reach 60k.  I'll be very happy if they greatly improve gas mileage and add a 6 speed transmission. It's my sincere hope that comfort is not sacrificed for handling as I find the DTS handles extremely well with the various electronic handling augments."
cadillac,dts,2006,b wagner, 11/14/2005,2006 Cadillac DTS Performance,4,"After owning this car for one week I can truly say that it exceeded my expectations. It performs better than I anticipated, and the ride and luxury are pure Cadillac.  The fit and finish are perfect, and the powerful sound of the 4.6 litre engine is great. I have been driving performance luxury cars for years, but this car gives me the room, comfort and the performance combination that I have been searching for. The 18 inch chrome wheel option is a must. The front and rear views of this car are great and the profile gives a nice clean look. I chose light platinum for the exterior and shale interior. The 291 hp matched with the 3.71 differential gives the car a lot of mid range power, 3,000 to 4,000 rpm. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Mac McCauley, 03/05/2006,"So Far, So Good",4,"Our 2006 Cadillac DTS Luxury is our first Cadillac.  We traded in a Buick LeSabre for it.  It is WAY better!  I read the other reviews to see if I could shed any further light on this car.  First, why would anyone buy a car that floats like a boat?  One test drive would tell me that.  Another review says the DTS is like a sports car.  A floating sports car? I like the ride MUCH better than the Buick. The ride is just right! Anyway, drive it before you buy it. Upon exit, the tilt wheel will go all the way up and in, just push the exit button again up to three times (not listed in owners manual). When unlocking the door, the seat will either move or not (personal setting).  There IS memory on the tilt wheel. What a car!"
cadillac,dts,2006,Ralph Rogers, 03/21/2006,Happy,4,I had one of the first Northstar engines in 1993 on a Cadillac Eldorado.  I was very happy with that engine so I had to get the Performance model in my 2006 DTS.  It took me a short while to learn about all the toys such as heated/cooled seats and the massage feature.  The Performance model has all the toys but is well worth the purchase just to get the engine.  After I sold my 1993 Cadillac I went in 2000 I went  with a Lincoln Towncar Cartier Edition.  The car was fine but I missed my Cadillac.  The DTS rides and drives great and the Performance model is the one to buy.   Get the added chrome wheels.  It really sets the car off.  I am very happy.
cadillac,dts,2006,Car Lover, 06/09/2006,Nice Car,4,"I bought a Cadillac DTS because it had the most roomy back seat of all the vehicles that we drove. I have been suprised by the quality of the car, it is really put together well. The performance version is a real kick to drive. Lexus drivers in the neighbohood are always impressed by the car. It is sensational for the money."
cadillac,dts,2006,coopera, 09/30/2006,Very Happy with the DTS,4,"I really am enjoying driving this vehicle considering that I have been driving an SUV for so many years.  The DTS is extremely comfortable...and I love the XM radio.  It is still early but, I think this will be a great car.  I have a small complaint...and that is sometimes I sit in the back seat and rest my left arm on the armrest since I recently had shoulder surgery.  The seat belts in the back seat are very uncomfortable and rub against my neck when I am sitting there.  Also, I think some of the interior trim could be a little more refined and better quality materials.  Other than that, the car is most enjoyable."
cadillac,dts,2006,stevo, 03/18/2007,"Nice Car, but the Exterior Design Needs Help",3,"I started owning Cadillacs in 2000 and loved the exterior design of the DTS models from 2000-2005.  I bought a 2006 in anticipation that it would be better, however in my opinion it is worse.  It has very shallow cup holders.  I have spilled several cups of coffee since owning the car due to this issue.  It also is a bit noisy during hard acceleration, but the cruising noise level is fine.  It has some torque steer at highway speed when you floor it because it is front wheel drive, which I find annoying.   The OnStar system is excellent and the fact that you can use your Verizon cell phone numbers with it is a nice feature."
cadillac,dts,2006,Chuck, 03/27/2007,Great experience,5,"I just got back from a trip to Florida and the DTS exceeded my fondest expectations. The ride was great, fuel economy ok (22 mpg overall in 2600 highway miles and 1600 urban miles), and the XM radio simply fantastic. The only criticism was in figuring out the memory seat coordination with the keys. The interior room and trunk space was well appreciated for a 4 week trip. This is my 15th cadillac and I would buy another one in a heart beat."
cadillac,dts,2006,satisfied owner, 05/22/2018,Nice cruiser,4,"The 2006 DTS is a comfortable and reliable vehicle with very adequate power and stability driving mountain roads. Like any vehicle, the highway mileage depends on how aggressively it is driven; highway cruising produces 28 - 29 mpg, whereas romping on it drops the mpg down to 22 - 23. Long haul trips with 400 - 450 miles between fuel and food stops are OK if you can sit that long.
"
cadillac,dts,2006,Dan, 12/18/2018,Great car but with Headlight Issues,4,"The headlights on this vehicle go on and off without doing anything. Either right and left and will leave you with only one light on and maybe no headlights on, and Cadillac dealers don't know the fix. I don't drive the car at night because I'm afraid of not having any headlights. Cannot understand why GM doesn't have a safety recall on this problem.

The car came with a 3 month warranty and took it into the Cadillac dealership where I bought it from and they replaced both Headlight Bulbs and both Ballast's at the cost of $1,251.00 and no problem since. This dealership in Merrillville Indiana is by far the best and they sure are honest. The thing I don't understand is why GM never had a recall on this issue as others have the same problem.  Been almost a year now and headlights are working great. Had to take back to dealership back in February because of oil leaks in the engine and at the cost of $3150.00 can still smell oil leaking on the exhaust somewhere.. Still covered by dealership warranty. In September of 2019 had to take vehicle in to dealership for check-engine light on at a cost of $500.00 for a O.2 Sensor on right side exhaust. Labor is very expensive for work at a Cadillac dealership for sure and am afraid to go in for any further work.

cadillac,dts,2006,cphillips, 11/07/2005,Great Car,5,My 2006 Cadillac DTS is great. It drives very well.  It is a 5-passager car with great comfort. It gets great fuel economy too.
cadillac,dts,2006,Madbuyer, 06/18/2006,Poor quality,2,The deflector on my DTS fell off on Route 95 going 75 miles per hour.  I thought the front end of the car was falling off.  I am still waiting for parts to fix it.  My car had 800 miles on it when the problem occurred.
cadillac,dts,2006,bigkahuna, 12/28/2006,DTS Hard Under Legs,3,The driver's seat in my DTS is very uncomfortable.  The premium leather has a rough finish and the seat cuts my legs under the thighs. This car also tends to over steer.

cadillac,dts,2006,Jerry G, 04/11/2008,Would not start,4,"Would not start AGAIN. This is the 3rd time since we bought it. It goes back to the dealer and on the 1st time he said we left something on. According to the owner's manual everything is supposed to shut down after 10 minutes. 2nd time they could find nothing. They still have it for the 3rd. time today. It remains to be seen what the problem may or may not be. Also lots of luck calling 1 800 Cadillac to get it started. The first 2 times they sent a qualified starting service, not today. This guy was not equipped to start a car that was still in the garage. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Grumpy1, 12/18/2005,How to mess up a great car,4,"Without a doubt this is one of the finest autos I have ever driven. But, I cannot understand why so many details were installed hastily just so that they could hurriedly put the car into production. The glove box for instance is no comparison to my old '02. Most of the interior is plastic. This is not what you would expect in a $50,000 car. The consol is about useless. There is no longer a light under the hood. Mine has a heated stearing wheel that does not heat. It has so many buttons to press that after three months I do not know what many of them are for. The easy exit seat is easy exit but not easy entrance. The doors dificult to close.  Also, amazingly this car does not have a locking gas door."
cadillac,dts,2006,caddyman28, 07/07/2008,Caddy Got It Right,5,"Great mileage for a large car 22 mpg with city and highway at 75 with 4 people. All toys of a Lexus at a lot less. Was going to by a new Dodge Charger SE plus for 23k. Did the math and got this car for less, more features with Cadillac CPO until 2012. Handles good, quiet and build quality is good. Caddy is back. "
cadillac,dts,2006,dennisfaust, 10/23/2007,Cadillac,5,"Great solid car. Good value. Rides like a Cadillac. Plenty of power. Economy is competitive to much smaller cars, and regular gas is a plus. Well designed interior. Everything fits and is comfortable. Quiet ride."
cadillac,dts,2006,Paul, 06/06/2008,Second Caddy,4,"After fully enjoying a certified pre-owned Deville, we opted for another certified pre-owned Caddy. This time we traded for a barely used level 4 Performance DTS. This car has almost every option Cadillac makes and has been a joy to drive. At almost half the sticker price with a 6 year/100K warranty, we thought the car was a bargain. It looks no different than an 08!"
cadillac,dts,2006,RTS, 06/24/2008,Small Business Owner & Manager,4,"I have owned 5 Cadillac DTS Performance Touring Sedans in the last 8 years. My current DTS is a 2006 with a custom after market ""DeLegance"" package and I have had hundreds of people make very positive comment on the looks of this automobile. It also gets admiring looks from Mercedes Benz and Lexus owners. This performance edition, although, only rated at 292 H.P. has substantial power and acceleration due to the Northstar engine and performance axle. I special ordered this Caddy with the Tehama Italian leather seats and they are very nice. I am more impressed with this Caddy than any other I have owned. The quality of construction, top notch materials and performance without any problems."
cadillac,dts,2006,bsdtwd, 07/11/2009,2006 DTS Luxury III,4,"Traded my 2000 DHS for the 2006 DTS Luxury III w/ Navig. Great car. Bose system is fantastic, navigation is nice but limited to larger metro. areas. Cruised Interstate at 31.02 Mpg. Massage seats, rear sunshade and cooled seats are a plus. Fat Big Ride at 28+ mpg. Go get one!"
cadillac,dts,2006,Tom, 11/04/2005,Just Test drove this car,4,"I own a 2003 DTS, which was in for service.  I love the car and have no problems. My 2003 is cetified so the dealership gave me a new DTS to drive while they were working on it. This is a very nice car! At first I did not like the look, or feel but as I drove it I noticed how quickly it repsonded to my touch, it handles great and is very fast.  I went to pass on the highway and was doing 75, within seconds I was hitting 95! This is a fast big sedan! When I got my 2003 back, my first thought was how much can I get on a trade? "
cadillac,dts,2006,Thad Stovall, 11/06/2005,DTS Delivers,4,"The 2006 DTS is a prestigious work of art that is an ""eye catcher"" and is worthy of the attention it gets. It is fashioned to rival the Asian and European luxury automakers. The DTS's design is an improvement over the previous DeVille, having improved handling and design."
cadillac,dts,2006,John, 01/07/2006,2006 Cadillac DTS,4,The exterior design of my 2006 Cadillac DTS is exceptional.  The exterior color options are good as well as interior colors. Its handling is better than the previous DeVille models.  The XM satellite radio is tremendous and the heated and cooled seats are exceptional.
cadillac,dts,2006,Martin, 04/10/2006,"Great Car, Poor Mileage",4,"I love the car.  I have had Infinitis (2), Jaguar (1), Volvo (1), Mazda Millenia (4), Dodge and Ford Pickups, Buick, etc etc.  The DTS has great room, the ride a little soft, and the design much improved.  I had an order in for new Lexus ES 350 but changed my mind when I drove the DTS.  The only problem besides the poor gas mileage is what appears to be overspray on windows and other surfaces.. I am going to have my dealer look at it soon."
cadillac,dts,2006,Happy owner, 05/10/2006,"Very, very happy",4,I have had my DTS Performance for 3 months and with the exception of its fuel consumption I could not be happier.  I've had several back operations and needed a comfortable smooth riding car I got beyond my expectations with the DTS.  It has power to spare. Comfort and ameneties are plentiful. My favorite option is the adaptive cruise control which does an amazing job maitaining safe spacing between cars.  The front and rear heated/cooled seats are extremely comfortable.  The sound system is excellent though with the nav system you loose the six disc changer. Other manufacturers manage to have a CD changer with nav system.  GM should do so too. Everything else is great.
cadillac,dts,2006,Betty Henson, 05/09/2006,Best Yet,5,"I have been driving Cadillacs since 1976 and this 2006 DTS is my favorite of all.  I love the new body style, as well as the improvements on the inside.  The color is Blue Ice, beautiful, rich color."
cadillac,dts,2006,sleepla, 05/09/2006,Nice Car for the Price,4,"I got an ex-rental Cadillac DTS for $32,000.  In my opinion, it is the best car for the money."
cadillac,dts,2006,cjnuss, 05/20/2006,Excellent Car,4,"This is the thrid Cadillac that I have owned since 1976.  The DTS is the best handling and the most quiet of the three. I have the Luxury 2 model with chrome wheels, titanium paint, and the trunk package.  I have had no trouble with it since my purchase. "
cadillac,dts,2006,RKing99, 05/20/2006,GM Got it Right!,4,"I really like the car.  It is my first Cadillac. It replaced a Q45. It has nice power, a great sound, and excellent build quality. My wife wanted comfortable seats, not European / Japanese hard seats. She really likes the comfort now and does not complain after long trips. The car is really quiet and has an excellent ride. The car has excellent handling abilities on the highway, tight steering, and only a little lean in the corners and curves for a car of this size and comfort. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Rob, 05/24/2006,Great Car,4,"This is a wonderful car, much improved over the DeVille, and it sells for LESS than the old version.  It is a quiet and a very well thought out car.  I love the ""rumble"" you hear from the exhaust when you give it a little acceleration.  "
cadillac,dts,2006,David Linton, 06/03/2006,Best Caddy I've owned.,4,"The longer I've had this car the more I like it. The only disappointment I have found is the floor mats, which are very cheesy.  The car would be even better if it had a 5 or 6 speed transmission."
cadillac,dts,2006,John Perry, 07/01/2006,Still the Standard to Beat,4,"After six months and more than 6,000 miles I am very happy with the car.  I did not think that I needed the heated steering wheel or the cooled front seat, but once I used them I would not want to do without them, even for the limited days they are really needed.  "
cadillac,dts,2006,Barbellman, 12/18/2005,Sweet Ride,4,"My other car is a 2003 Corvette so when I say I'm impressed by my new DTS Performance Edition it should mean something. I've only put about 3,000 miles on it so far but I love this car! It's excellent handling and punchy V8 are a pleasant surprise in a car as large as the DTS. If you're looking for a car in this catagory you've got take a DTS out for a test drive."
cadillac,dts,2006,VetteGuy, 12/21/2005,Cadtastic,4,"I am an owner of a 2004 C5 Corvette and rented a 06 DTS while I traveled to Pennsylvania. I can't believe how much I fell in love with this car! It was really hard giving back the keys at the airport and I even looked back one more time before going into the entrance. I must have looked over at the wife 40 times while driving it and I kept saying ""oh man, I love this car...we have to get one"". Cadillac definitely has a winner on their hands and I hope one ends up in mine. The ride is smooth yet not to sloppy like the land boats of yesteryear. The power is delivered smootly and with total assurance by the hearty V8 engine. We had two HUGE suitcases and other bags and the trunk swallowed them with ease."
cadillac,dts,2006,Dave, 01/12/2006,Disappointed,4,"I waited months for my 2006 Cadillac DTS Luxury. It replaced my 2004 DHS. I have had a new Cadillac every 12-18 months since 1988. I am disappointed with the 2006 DTS. Is Cadillac trying to make the DTS a sport car?  Big tires and rims = a poor ride.  Here are some other things I don't like:  The gas tank is too small. The fule door does not lock remotely.  The fuel cap holder is too low on the filler door, allowing the cap to rub against the body. There is no memory on the electric tilt wheel, no pass-to-flash unless headlights are on.  The arm rest on the driver's door is too low. Also, what's with the chrome door lock knobs sticking me in the arm?  This car has poor workmanship, a gap in the caulk around trunk resulted in trunk well full of water."
cadillac,dts,2006,B, 01/16/2006,Delighted,4,"We're delighted with our 2006 Cadillac DTS and would gladly do it again.  It has a large trunk for hauling gifts to children and grandchildren was an important feature for us and this car delivers on that. We've been surprised and delighted at how good the gas mileage is on the highway - 27+ mpg.  Everything about the car has been great, and it compared extremely well price-wise and feature-wise to other luxury cars. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Elena Linton, 02/09/2006,Wonderful Car,5,"Love almost everything about the Cadillac DTS, except the floor mats.  It is one of the most comfortable cars I have ever driven and it has power to spare.  The only complaint I have, besides the floor mats, is that a five or six speed transmission would be a welcome improvement."
cadillac,dts,2006,big jack, 03/02/2006,2006 Cadillac DTS,4,I find the 2006 Cadillac DTS to be a much better car than the 2003 DeVille that I traded in for it.  It is a more solid and quiet car.  The only problem is its poor gas mileage.
cadillac,dts,2006,ROBERT W FLAGG, 03/21/2006,Cadillac DTS,5,"This is the first Cadillac I have owned since the mid-nineties.  This car is very quiet - no road or wind noise. I also have a Lexus 430, a great car but not as attractive in the interior or the exterior as the Cadillac.  So far the mileage is very good!"
cadillac,dts,2006,Denny Pemberton, 05/03/2006,I Just Love It,4,"I made the mistake of buying an '05 STS, to me it's not what I consider a Cadillac, it rode rough and you could hear and feel every little bump, they tried to make a sports car out of a luxury car and they were way off, so in Apr of '06 I bought a new DTS.  Believe me there's a world of difference The ride, style, comfort and room just to name a few.  Try the DTS and you'll love it."
cadillac,dts,2006,Charlie, 05/10/2006,Personal Opinion,4,"The Cadillac DTS has an excellent appearance and outstanding performance, It is pleasant driving, smooth riding, and has no outside wind noise.  I get many favorable comments from passing pedestrians. It is my 13th Cadillac and I trade every two years. It is somewhat lacking on gas mileage in city driving though."
cadillac,dts,2006,Peter, 05/13/2006,Just in the Nick of Time,4,"I bought a certified 2003 ETC and wanted to get another but, sadly, the Eldorado was discontinued in 2002.  I had no plans to get another Cadillac because none of their other models appealed to me, but the 2006 DTS, is no longer an ""old-folk's"", boat of a car and it really got my attention.  It looks great inside and out. The Performance package has more options than one has the right expect.  Getting all the preferences set takes some study and experimentation, but this car really pampers you once they are. The DTS has plenty of power, as good as my ETC and is very quiet and well-mannered on the road. The environment control is superb."
cadillac,dts,2006,Dr Leonard Pal, 05/26/2006,First New Cadillac,5,"It feels good in these times to have bought an American product.  Is every bit as good, if not better, than the BMW I bought new, or the Lexus bought new."
cadillac,dts,2006,DTS, 06/09/2006,Our fourth Cadillac,4,"My wife is of European origin, and she insisted that we buy American. Each vehicle we have purchased has been better than the previous model. The DTS is very comfortable for both the driver and passenger. It has more than enough power for both open road and getting around town. No one should carry more than it can fit in the generous trunk. My only complaint about this latest model is that Cadillac dropped the electronic seat adjustment gadget that fixed the seat to fit the preferences of the driver for that key."
cadillac,dts,2006,DTSV, 08/25/2006,I Love it!,4,"My husband and I have owned a Cadillac STS V6 for years.   The DTS is amazing,  It has a wonderfaul ride, great pickup and is beautiful to look at.  Wow !  What a great car."
cadillac,dts,2006,Larry H, 09/05/2006,Lots of Great Car for the Price,4,"I am very pleased with this big sedan.  It is smaller than the Lincoln Town Car.  Recently redesigned with a great looking exterior, the DTS caught my eye when it first came out.  I even traded my Jaguar XJR to get one.  The Caddy has better acceleration, is quieter, and is a good car for clients - comfortable, smooth, easy to enter and exit. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Rob, 09/09/2006,Great Car,4,"This is a great car.  It is quiet, powerful, and has great styling.  Cadillac doesn't market this car as a ""Euro luxury"" car, but as a great American luxury car, which I like.    "
cadillac,dts,2006,Ted Gardner, 10/04/2006,Best Buy,4,"Have driven it 4000 miles and have enjoyed evry mile. View from all windows is excelent, performance is great and milage is astonishing for a big automobile. Handling in the mountains with the stability package is really great, but you have to get used to it. This is my second Cadillac, my other one was a 97 and it was a very good car. I never spent a dime on it except for tires brakes and regular oil changes in 115,00 miles. I am sure the improvments that have been made since then shoould prove this one to be better than the first one. I can drive it fro 8 hours plus and still am not tired.  "
cadillac,dts,2006,Buday, 10/11/2006,Outstanding Vehicle,5,"This is my fourth Cadillac, my first in twelve years. What a terrific performing and smooth riding vehicle. I tried out a Lexus LS 430 and believe the DTS has a better ride and comparable quietness and build quality for $20,000 less. I like it better the more I drive it.  My car has had no problems to date."
cadillac,dts,2006,mcdphd, 10/26/2006,Great Car,4,This car is great!  I love this car.  It has good get up and go.  It rides like a dream and is very comfortable inside.
cadillac,dts,2006,frank, 11/08/2006,A Luxury Car that is Undervalued,4,"I've owned many luxury cars and find this year's Cadillac DTS to be a great value for the money. It rides great, has good design details, and its fit and finish are greatly improved, offering a comfortable ride with plenty of room and cargo space. "
cadillac,dts,2006,Cadillac, 12/23/2006,Cadillac,4,"This is the best car I ever owned.  It has a great ride, handles well, and has lots of extras that make driving more fun."
cadillac,dts,2006,steve saunders, 12/28/2006,2006 DTS w/Performance Package,4,"As a former Eldorado owner, the size of the DTS took a while to get used to. With the performance package it handles well for a car of its size and it still rides well.  It has the best suspension for this car - I've driven both styles. The interior is typical Cadillac high quality. The downside of the interior is the cup holders.  They are too shallow  to really really hold cups or bottles, especially during turns or braking. I had issues with the original dealership and Cadillac introduced me to another dealer for any required maintenance or warranty work.  Cadillac has excellent customer relations. I like the OnStar system.  My next car will be an STS-V."
cadillac,dts,2006,2006 Cadillac DTS, 02/09/2007,Finally a Real Winner,4,"I love to drive this car. After having several Cadillacs, none of them came close to this one.  Its room, comfort, and performance are all up there and it's priced right!"
cadillac,dts,2006,Lloyd, 06/20/2007,2006 DTS Performance Sedan,4,"Awsome vehicle very comfortable with performance and great handling. The Performance edition with the larger engine gives a little extra punch, the ride is much better with the enhanced suspension and ride package, takes bumps and railroad tracks with ease. Brakes very well stops on a dime while holding the road. Navagation system combined with onstar is easy to use and very accurate. Bose soundsystem with centerpoint sounds awsome especially with XM or a CD in play. I am very comfortable in my driver seat for a long drive thanks to 8 way power seats with memory and the cooling and massage features."
cadillac,dts,2006,Duke Borkoski, 10/23/2007,I'd buy it again,4,"This is my 4th Caddy and it has more omph that any of the previous 3.  Great color -Ice Blue. Got better mileage with the '03 but this still gets 25-27 mpg on the road.  Love the extra toys - heated steering wheel, OnStar, etc."
cadillac,dts,2006,Harold Brooks, 03/25/2008,My opinion,4,"It is a real pleasure driving this vehicle. The battery burned out recently and a new one was purchased. It is equipped with OnStar, which had come in handy in several occasions. The sensors make it easy to park in tight places. The low mileage is a result of not taking any long trips."
cadillac,dts,2006,James Petralia, 12/14/2017,Starship of the road,5,"I purchased my 2006 Cadillac DTS Performance model from a used car dealer in upstate N. Y. in January 2017. At the time of purchase, I was retired from an insurance Marketing position for 35 years and had always been provided a company car. What a great car this DTS is! After almost a year of ownership, I can't think of a single thing except mpg to criticize in this vehicle. It has plenty of power, smooth ride, stable breaking and all around fine handling. Not to mention, it is a great looking car from GM.
"
cadillac,dts,2007,Jim , 10/04/2006,Best I've Ever Owned,4,"This is the best car I have owned in 55 years of owning and driving vehicles.  It is comfortable, enjoyable to drive, good looking, and I know of no other vehicle that meets the same standard."
cadillac,dts,2007,BigJJ, 09/11/2015,"Over 200,000 miles and going...",5,"I just past 200,000 miles!!! I've owned this Caddy for almost 7yrs. Bought with 1684miles...yes, 1,684! Regular oil changes & tune-ups and I've had one issue... At 154,320miles I had the transmission go out. I had it rebuilt. Now at 201,140 there is a ticking that's coming from the engine block and I have a torn drivers side seat. The car is going to be my son's after the ticking sound is looked at by Cadillac. 
I am now looking for another 2007-2010 DTS!!!

cadillac,dts,2007,Kim, 10/02/2015,A dream to drive .,5,"This car replaced 2000 cadillac Deville. Which did get better mpg.then the 2007 dts but hands down this dts with the performance package is awesome to drive the power and handling and comfort is a dream and style is tops.

cadillac,dts,2007,singboi, 02/14/2013,1St Caddy,4,"I just purchased a 1 owner '07 Cadillac DTS Performance for $17,995 with 68,000 miles. I love everthing about the car I did a year of research on the Cadillac DTS before I purchased one and the Performance is the best of them all. I got everything I wanted in the car. "
cadillac,dts,2007,applevalleyallstar, 07/27/2008,Mystic Gray DTS,4,"Fun to drive, tighter cabin feel,no gas tank release or lock, no automatic break release, rear trunk area too high, no auto trunk close/lock.  Leaves a lot to be desired from the previous years of Cadillac ownership.  Driver's seat really squeals with the leather rubbing against the console, rear headliner problems.  Navigation is great, so is the Bose sound.  Gas mileage is less than my previous DTS by three miles city and 2 miles highway.  The higher end, shorter body makes it look more like a sport than a luxury sedan.  The vehicle has enough power, but sure sucks up the gas when you, 'step on it'.  Nice color coordination on the Mystic Gray ext. and the titanium interior. "
cadillac,dts,2007,airforcdinstar, 10/28/2011,Poor craftsmanship,1,"I purchased the car Certified Pre-Owned with 68000 miles. It has been in the shop 4 times for Wheel bearing, hubs, fuel sending unit, transmission leak,engine valve cover gasket and some other things. I purchased this car thinking Cadillac was a step up from some of the poor quality Chevrolets I drove. WOW I was wrong. I traded in a brand new 2011 Ford Taurus that I couldn't affford so I traded down and Paid 15,500 for this car. Thankfully its under warranty, however Cadillac service center managers are very aggressive and challenge me on all the repairs, thankfully I am a mechanic for the Air Force and I know a little bit about cars. This car is a nightmare and Cadillac service is horrible!"
cadillac,dts,2007,Robert, 01/15/2019,Best car I have ever owned.,5,"First it has a V-8. I have never shopped for a car based on mpg. I do care about planet! Just do not drive very much. I am 65 yr old single male and have had quite a few cars over my lifetime (nothing high end like German). This is my second Cadillac, first a Fleetwood 60 special mid 1990's that just wore out. I bought this at Cad dealer in 2007, after bad (perhaps I got a lemon) Lincoln Ls-V8 that had over 6,000.00$ maint by 55K miles. Cad dealer worked with me to afford and I love it. Turned down offer just other day to sell. And this from a gentleman who was driving it's twin! As far as it's handling notes, I drive a rather twisty and moderate high speed road twice a week. This model (DTS) is sort of unique especially among American cars. 1, OHC V-8 it will really rev 2, FWD and rather heavy. I had an old Pontiac many many years ago with the SD-455 and if I drove it like this car on curves it would have killed me. And most important when I bought this car I ordered the very top of the line (traction but they don't last) Pirellis. There is a M-series out there I bet still wondering what kind of cad he me a few years ago. Hope you had fun reading with luck this will be the last car this old car guy will ever need
"
cadillac,dts,2007,ManDude 1983, 06/16/2020,GET ONE! BUT BE PREPARED FOR TEMPER TANTRUMS,4,"I never thought I'd buy a Cadillac, let alone a DTS. The interior is cheap, base speakers sound like a boom box, cooled seats are a joke, radio screen is obsolete in the daytime, the arm rest is as soft as a brick, the steering wheel only tilts up and down, and the outside temperature reading is located down on the climate control deck.  I was a little unsure when I first bought her if she’d last beyond 2 years, but after my last 200 mile journey in the left (fast) lane at a consistent 80mph, I knew I had found my tribe. She can keep up with the best of them without sloppy or mundane handling like my 05 Town Car. The underrated NorthStar engine is simply amazing! so much so, that I can overlook the basic interior. She's a little temperamental with her annoying sensors and audible dings, but she'll never leave nor forsake you. The best part is most people wouldn't give her two looks, even the police. But that's where she shines as she stately passes everyone in her way without wavering. 
"
cadillac,dts,2007,A., 11/10/2018,2007 Caddy DTS Luxury II Package,5,"I purchased this car in July 2018. This is a great car and the last of the comfortable, full size Cadillac's with air ride. This specific car is black raven in color, fully loaded with anything you could get in 2007. I've added lots of chrome accessories which really make it look more expensive. This car has the 4.6 Northstar motor in it. People complain of oil leaks & bad head gaskets with these engines. It's now 2020 and I've had 3 Northstars (all of very different years) which all served me well with no issues. They are as good as the GM 3800 motors which I have also. Maintenance means everything on any car. This car has just over 107,000 miles on it and has only needed headlight ballasts and a new radiator. The transmission shifts smooth under hard acceleration. The HID headlights are extra bright for driving at night. The car is great on gas and very powerful. I would buy another one again if I didn't have so many cars already!
"
cadillac,dts,2007,usa4me, 06/12/2013,"Not perfect, but reliable as the sunrise, and fun to drive!",4,"This car is an absolute dream to drive. It has a firm, yet compliant ride, handles great at high speeds through the mountain pass I drive through twice a day to work and back. Acceleration is brisk, and the top end is terrific for such a big car. Room galore inside for six, large trunk, and killer looks make this a very sane car in comparison to even some V6 foreign cars. I average 24 MPG including a 15 minute climb of 4500 feet 2X a day. I have averaged 27+ on a 2.5 hour drive via highway. Phenomenal mileage for a V8 with loads of power on tap at any speed. "
cadillac,dts,2007,Rebecca Cockrell, 01/27/2017,Love my DTS...,5,"I bought this car used six years ago and have driven it 2/3 of its life.  It has been a pleasure to drive.  I previously owned a 1992 Lexus LS 400 and was intending to drive it forever, but it was a little small for my husband.  The DTS has met his need for more room and it had more ""bells and whistles than my '92.  It took a while to get used to the more ""cushiony"" drive, but after I did I fell in love with it.  Could not live without OnStar.  Only reason I am trading is because we need a higher car due to hip problems, so plan on getting an SRX.  Otherwise would keep it for years more.  Love it.

cadillac,dts,2007,David , 08/13/2019,Luxury ride for ow budget price,4,"I have owned a 2007 DTS for almost 3 years and really enjoy it a lot.  The ride, room, luxury feel and looks are what Cadillac built their reputation on and this car does not disappoint.  The biggest caveat is that it must be driven like the big heavy boat it is or you will burn through gas, brakes and suspension parts, all of which can be expensive.  I have yet to replace any brake components but have had to replace tie rods, etc.,after 2 years.  
I do not recommend for a youthful driver.  It is built for a more mature experienced driver who anticipates rather than reacts to the road.  
If you are looking for a car under $6k that look and drives like you spent 10 times that, do consider the DTS.  While repairs can be pricey they are far less than a BMW or Mercedes and are comparable to other GM products.  The engine seems rock solid as does the tranny.  It can't be beat for comfort on the highway and I get about 28mpg at 72mph.  Town MPG varies from as low as 8 in the summer to 12 in moderate traffic."
cadillac,dts,2007,Makon, 08/30/2006,Great '07 Vehicle,4,"I have driven many Cadillacs in this series over the years like the Concour, Performance DTS, etc.  I especially like the upgraded styling, performance, and new xeon lighting."
cadillac,dts,2007,John, 12/09/2007,Get a Life--it's a Caddy!,4,"Why do ""reviewers"" think everything on wheels has to be an McClaren?  This is a luxury car that is extremely comfortable, reasonably nimble for a 2- ton vehicle, easy to enter and exit, gets me 18+ mpg around town, well made, gives me a back massage, decent appearance.  It does what I want it to do in terrific fashion!  I'm not sure why a luxury automobile needs 55-series tires, 17 inch wheels, and nearly 300 horsepower, but it does.  I've owned a 800 hp street-legal '57 Chevy, I've driven my Dad's Chrysler Hemi for several thousand miles--and they were both great, but I'll take my Caddy for everyday driving.  It's solid American iron and I don't think it needs to apologize for anything!"

I have owned my one owner 2007 DTS for about 16 months now and have had it in the shop for many repairs (exactly 33 times) 3 brake jobs, 2 water pumps, heated/cooled seats motor replacements, sunroof leaks, low oil pressure sensor, etc..etc.. the list goes on. I will never own another GM vehicle of any sort after owning this and having a better look at everything on this car and a real eye opener to GM auto's in general.

cadillac,dts,2007,racer, 02/28/2007,"DTS - Better Than Any MB, BMW or Jag",5,Driving the new DTS is the most user friendly experience ever.  It does for luxury what the '07 Corvette does for performance.  You don't have to spend a fortune to have the best ride on the road - this car looks great and gives the passengers a feeling of safety and comfort that is top level and impressive. 
cadillac,dts,2007,Cat Dude, 08/18/2009,Very Pleased WIth This Car,4,"I purchased the 2007 DTS Performance used, with 13,000 miles. It replaced a 2003 CTS. WE are very pleased with the handling, quietness, and comfort of the vehicle. The MPG is very positively surprising, particularly when the car plenty of power. THe memory seats are very handy, the controls are simple and well within reach. The Bose sound system is very nice. We've traveled quite a bit in this car this year and we arrive much more relaxed than when in traveling in other cards we've had. Visibility seems poor when backing the car, and the proximity sensors help. Very well pleased with this American car. "
cadillac,dts,2007,luvchrysler, 08/26/2010,Basic American Iron,4,"The ride, comfort and convenience are what the DTS is about. Handling is soft and imprecise, but secure. This was purchased to be a highway cruiser, and as such it excels. This is our 4th caddy and 2nd DTS, the previous DTS was an '03 and was basically run to the ground. The '03 was plagued with electrical problems, which were addressed with the '06 upgrade. Thoughtful touches include the cooled seats, remote start and heated steering wheel. The white led instrument-interior lighting is clear and attractive, the sweep of the dash modern with intuitive controls. Seat belts are difficult to latch though, and the lack of an outside trunk lock a strange omission.  "
cadillac,dts,2007,BenKelba, 02/21/2007,My DTS,4,"This car rides and handles much better than I expected.  For its size, comfort, and economical operations I cannot think of a better choice.  I use the car to transport customers on trips between 10 miles to over 100 miles.  I always hear comments like ""how come they don't sell more of these.""  I am never ashamed to use this vehicle with my clients."
cadillac,dts,2007,captfx, 09/05/2011,NO WASHER HEATER,4,"Pros: 
I love the styling. After 4 years I think I like the look even more than when I first got it. It is a real head turner. I get a lot of nice complements. I have the black with black interior. Although a step down from the performance model the car is a rocket. I love driving it.
 
Cons:
Cadillac recalled the windshield washer heater. It could leak, short circuit and may cause a fire. Their solution was to remove the unit and 4 weeks later send you a check for $100. Hard to believe. They should have replaced the unit instead they took the cheap way out. They did this with other Cadillacs and Buick. I hope they don't recall the a/c or power steering. Because of this my next luxury car "
cadillac,dts,2007,Apple Valley All Star, 02/18/2020,All Class 07 DTS Luxury 11,4,"I have owned this beauty since 08. It was a corporate lease. Still smelled new when it was delivered to my house. Yes, in 08,  I was far ahead of the buy on line game. 
Currently 72,000 gentle miles. No lead foot here.
Always serviced by Cadillac.

Pros: classic ride, handles very well. Has all the bells and whistles. Gorgeous wood in cabin and on steering wheel. Fully loaded.
 It is beautiful Mystic Grey with titanium interior and eye catching chrome rims. People still turn their head when I drive by. Paint still has the factory high gloss shine. Comments: That's when a Cadillac was a CADILLAC!

Cons: 3rd break light replaced 3 times, no harsh use.  3 of the 4 electric window assemblies have been replaced probably due to not enough use.

 I've been waiting for a new flagship vehicle for 6 years. Maybe in 2022. The concept car Escala might make the assembly line at a pricey 100k plus.  
Don't know if I will ever again find such a wonderful car which had everything including the interior and exterior color I wanted, at 17,000 miles, Cadillac certified 6/100,000 and half the original  sticker price.  I love this car.

This is the second new Cadillac I've owned, my 04'Deville was a total lemon and I thought it was an anomaly, unfortunately it wasn't, my 07' is an even bigger lemon!  I don't know where to start, the car breaks down almost constantly, everything from electrical to drivetrain, even the heated seats broke.  The front wheel drive system, axils, seals and transmission are a mess.  The car spends more time in the shop than in my garage.  If I was to give a complete list of everything that's been repaired on this car it would take an hour to read.  About all this car does is look good standing still.     "

I highly recommend tis wonderful American made automobile. 
cadillac,dts,2007,mike, 04/11/2010,Helpful,4,So far the vehicle seems to be a typical Cadillac. I have noticed it uses more fuel than other caddys I have owned and I am surprised that the gas tank door can be opened from the outside also it seems the radio does not have real good reception 
cadillac,dts,2007,Dean Franklin, 08/10/2010,Good rider,3," I have driven a few hundred miles, but no trips yet. This is a solid car with no rattles and no surprises. Stereo is excellent, engine power is sufficient. Fit and finish of the interior is miles ahead of a 2004. It is a pleasure to drive but I feel cheated having a 4 speed trans on an expensive car."
cadillac,dts,2007,Dean Franklin, 09/08/2010,Lots to like,4,"I just got back from a trip that was 1000 miles each way. Did not get tired, and that speaks volumes. Since the dash was moved forward compared to my 2004 DTS it feels spacious. The DTS doesn't follow the shape [high rear, low front) of some other cars so with the seat raised some I have a good view front and back. Pleasant ride with the feel of being in control. The engine torque is impressive. The wide brake makes for easy two feet driving.      "
cadillac,dts,2007,dino, 02/18/2008,Superior to LS460,5,This is a fantastic vehicle. Worlds ahead the previous model. Excellent performance & much quieter at high speeds than the LS460 & superior seats.

cadillac,dts,2007,vacationer, 03/27/2007,Wow!,4,"We rented one of these babys in Hawaii. Trust me, this is definitely a car that anyone should show up in to any sort of party or get together. Plenty of power; sounds like a muscle car when revved, lots of get up and go, and extremely quiet. Handles decently as well for a car 9 ft. longer than a Lexus LS 460. It is more the experience of driving one (as would be driving something like a Lincoln Town Car) more than actually owning it. If you need seating for 6 and something old and stylin', go for it! Way too overpriced though for some of the idiosyncracies is has; just pick up a used one."

cadillac,dts,2007,Jack Kreska, 08/27/2007,Bad seats,3,"Fake leather dash and door panels, too much plastic, uncomfortable seats. The optional ""bench"" seats have no lateral support, the seat is too short and does not support my legs, and I cannot find a comfortable position. The passenger seat is similar. Our previous DeVille (2002) had much better seats than this one. The steering wheel is heated but the leather cover does not extend to the 10 and 2 oclock driving areas.  Also, the instruments and console are difficult to read while wearing sun glasses (and we really need them in Texas).  The luxury options are great, but overall, we're really disappointed with what they've done to this car."
cadillac,dts,2007,G. Cline, 08/04/2007,Not Impressed,3,"I took a 2000 mile trip a month after I purchased the vehicle, and I was not impressed with the handling or functioning of the vehicle. Navigation system worked fine there, but, was inoperative on the way back. I was only able to select point-to- point (not selected roads).  Stability control allows too much sway on turns (not near as good as my 1995 Eldorado ETC).  Icons and Switches:  Switches on the Armrest are poorly placed and poorly labeled. Heating and Ventilation: Poor design for the controls. The Air Conditioning blows cold air even when it is 30 degrees outside, and, the car is first started.

cadillac,dts,2007,KenB757, 06/28/2007,'07 DTS,4,"The levels of engine and road noise are still excessive in the current DTS, especially when compared to the Town Car, Mercedes Benz, and Lexus models. There is still too much NVH feedback through the steering wheel. A couple of times, when making a sharp U-turn, it felt as if the drive belt slipped resulting in the temporary failure of the power steering. Another annoyance is a squeak caused by the front seat back rubbing against the stationary center armrest console when encountering bumps. Get the bench seat option if you hate squeaks. Cadillac knows of the problem since the side of the seat bottom cushion contacting the console is covered in fabric. I will consider another DTS in '09."
cadillac,dts,2007,BJ TX, 10/16/2007,Much to be desired,2,"The car looks nice enough but interior design needs help, may as well put the radio and A/C panels & controls on the floor since it is necessary to turn & look down to see them. The seat belt buckle is difficult to find jammed up by the center console. The plastic interior is poor quality for a LUX car. The ride is smooth the engine power is good, steering could be tighter. This car rides and handles no better than my base 01 De Ville and lacks the comfort. The controls in the arm rest are poor design resting my arm on it the windows go down and the controls are touchy. There are too many DIC switches. The tire monitor has stopped working. Rear visibility past the rear doors down the side."

cadillac,dts,2007,vegas caddy driver, 11/25/2019,2007 cadillac dts,4,"the one bad item on the car is the Northstar engine. I had to have new seals put in at 45000 miles. Most say new seals from 75000-10000 miles. Also, the memory on the seat locks into one setting and will not remember. The car has more power than the front wheels can handle and can have strong torque steer problems in a turn from start. Gas mileage is 3.5 mpg worse than my 2004 Deville which ran on regular, so say 4-5 miles per gallon per dollar more. Other than that it is more comfortable than any other car I have owned.

It rides like you're in your own living room!  When you sit inside and start it up, you think you're in a space ship...lights all around!  It's designed to work with OnStar, so we had to get an aftermarket bluetooth adapter.  The navigation is CD (DVD?) driven, so future updates should not be a problem.  I LOVE the dual heated and cooled front seats, and the rear seats also have heat!
TWO YEAR UPDATE:  Still going strong with only routine upkeep.  She just needed a small touch-up on some surface rust on one door.  At 90,000+ miles, still a very reliable car.  All electronics work (and it's LOADED).  Comfortable to ride.
THREE YEAR UPDATE:  The 3rd brakelight on the trunk was found to have some lights not working.  Bought a new light online and had our local mechanic install it.  Nearly 100,000 miles on it and STILL just like new!
November 2018:  Noting rare slippage in the transmission, we decided to trade-in.  Now leasing a Kia Forte instead.  Someone will still get many enjoyable years from this Cadillac.

I am not the typical age of the traditional Caddy buyer.   I like the size, comfort, and style of large American Cars.  Family has always driven Caddys or Lincolns and I carry on that tradition with a great amount of pride.  Purchased Certified-Used in early 2011, traded a 2005 Deville DTS that I loved. The 2008 DTS is NOT a sports car nor is it intended to be. I am so very disappointed in its reliability issues not only for the cost but also for sentimental reasons."

I was able to test drive the best of Europe, Asia and the US any way I wanted. Believe me, no expensive import offers anything more than the Cadillac DTS except snob appeal.

cadillac,dts,2008,rdownie, 03/30/2014,Glad I didn't sell my Merc Grand Marquis.,2,"Two years ago, I purchased a 2008 Cadillac DTS with 62,000 miles. It was to replace my 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis with 156,000 miles---now 163,000.
The Cad looks and runs like a brand new car, but the ride is not near as nice as my aging Grand Marquis. Lots of road noise on city streets.

Plus, too many buttons to push---very distracting. I would have bought another Mercury, but Ford wrongly decided to not manufacture them any more.  The Mercury does not have as many distracting buttons to push and the ride, both city and highway, are much, much better.

Headroom in the Cadillac for the driver's side is poor.  I am 5'11"" and 230 lbs.  I have to move the seat to the maximum down and rear positions, plus relocate the steering wheel to the maximum up position, in order to get in without bumping my head on the door frame.  In my 60 years of driving, I have owned many luxury cars.  This Cad is the worst of them all.  By the way, my wife, much smaller, loves the car, or I would get rid of it immediately.

The Cadillac recently developed an oil leak in a cover on the front part of the engine.  The Cad dealer wanted $2,900.00 to repair this mild to moderate leak, stating that the entire engine has to be removed to make the repairs.  Ugh to Cadillac and General Motors.

Another distraction is the speedometer display.  When the morning sun is up, you cannot read the dash lights.  And, turning the headlights on to the maximum does not help any.  No more Cadillac's for me.  This is not a car for the un-rich owner.  Driving into the Cadillac Dealer costs an arm and a leg for even the smallest services.  I have traded this Cadillac off for a new KIA Optima.  Not as many buttons to push but the compact KIA handles better and is more comfortable than the ""Luxury"" Cad.  As previously said----no more Cadillac's for me.

cadillac,dts,2008,Ralph, 06/28/2008,American Luxury Car,5,"I traded a BMW 745 for a Cadillac DTS. The Cadillac lacks some of the more sophisticated technology of the BMW but it is easier to maintain, it rides beautifully, and is easy to get serviced. Consumer Reports recommended this car for reliability in part because it dispenses with some of the cutting edge technology and, instead, provides reliability and a more affordable price.  The large trunk and back seat and good for carrying more passengers and luggage. We use this car as a road car for longer trips. It takes regular gas, parts are easy to get and there is an extensive dealer network. GM has done an excellent job with this car."

My old DHS was a great car with a bad transmission.  I had a few problems and tried to contact the ""help"" line.  They refused to let me talk to a decision maker and were basically worthless.  Cadillac apparently does not want to talk to customers.  I am trying to go through the dealership and they will not give me the name of the GM Rep so I am not allowed to talk to her.

Below 25 or above 30 mph the gear noise cannot be heard. Suspect the transaxel. The side seat buckles in the back seat are set down too far making it difficult or next impossible for an average size adult to connect the latch to the buckle.

When I got my first one I was only 44..below average demographic..love the comfort; acceleration; and handling..not interested in overrated and overpriced German or Japanese..Caddy packages all options neatly..takes me 20 minutes to buy my car..always get the White Diamond..keep building these."
cadillac,dts,2008,chuck, 12/19/2009,Fuel Economy lacking,4,"I have had several Cadillacs including a 2006 DTS that got good to excellent gas mileage.I use the DTS primarily as a short to long trip car,so it's mostly highway driving.Still the mileage as recorded by the computer fuel monitor is in the low 20's, where the 2006  was in the mid 20's. As far as the looks and comfort of the car,I am well pleased."
cadillac,dts,2008,jacobson, s,jacobson's DTS review,4,"I started driving a Cadillac when Oldsmobile stopped building the original Aurora. I travel from Florida to Atlanta, GA and the ride is comfortable, quiet, and smooth, my companion reads a book all during the drive. On one trip my cruise control stopped working, I hit my OnStar button and they made an appointment for me at a dealership near where I was staying. The service manager was waiting for me and the problem was solved.  He called me to make sure everything was completed to my satisfaction.That is Cadillac quality and servuce."
cadillac,dts,2008,Caddy Daddy 2K19, 12/25/2019,Most Bang For Your Buck,5,"I owned my first car when I was 16, a 1994 Honda Accord. Then, I upgraded to a 2002 Lincoln Continental when I turned 20. Next, a 2004 Cadillac SRX when i married, had a baby and turned 23. I am now 33 and drive a 2008 Cadillac DTS. I recently bought this car 10 months ago with 84,000 miles for $7,500. I’ve had to do some routine maintenance (brake, bearing, battery, a couple spark plugs) since i bought it. I attribute this more to the small dealership than a testament to the reliability/durability of the DTS. Even after sinking a couple thousand dollars into this beast since purchase, it’s still a great buy. I revamped the audio system, adding dual 12” subs in the trunk and JL audio speakers and tweets throughout the cabin. I will also be throwing Vogue whitewalls on this big boi once the winter is over. Don’t feel the need to replace the stock rims as I really like them. My Lac has a landau roof and looks so classy. Too classy. Had to go bad grandpa and throw a giant naked chrome lady (Sabrina) on the hood. Car now looks sufficiently G’d up. Macs drive Lacs. The interior is a creamy linen throughout. Upgraded to some custom Lloyd mats with the Cadillac name written in script. Also put in Cadillac crest logo welcome-lights for the front doors at night. Classy. The front seats are heated and cooled, rear seats are heated. Steering wheel is heated. I added a car alarm and remote start. It’s heavenly having a warm seat and nice cozy car on these cold New England morning. The car is a beast to maneuver and park for the uninitiated. I’ve always been a lover of large American sedans, so I be wheelin. There are nice wood accents throughout the cabin. Not sure if the wood is wheel or not but it all looks nice. I love some good, clean, creamy beige interior leather, my goodness. So plush and luxurious (for the pricepoint). The stock radio was hideous, i did not have the model with the dvd navigation screen. No worries, ripped that garbage out and threw in a kenwood touch screen. The seats are comfortable and the car is fun and comfortable to drive. Lots of compliments from all age groups and genders. People love the car, it’s a real head turner. I’ve heard of issues and criticisms regarding the 2008 Cadillac DTS. I did not buy the car new. I did not pay $50,000 for a platinum DTS with an oil leak. So I can only speak to my experience. For $7,500 84,000 miles there is no better balance of luxury and price. There just isn’t. This car is in the class of 300, Lucerne and Town Car. This is not a sporty car to whip around corners. This is a large, luxurious, good ol’ fashioned American land yacht. I know the upkeep involved in maintaining such a vehicle. If you’re worried about gas mileage or paying for premium gas and full synthetic oil and leather wipes for the seats and doors and weekly carwashes ... this is not the car for you. Furthermore, this is not the car company for you. You might want to drive a Kia. This is not a Kia. This is a Cadillac.

The 2004 had better interior and sound system. I like the H.I.D. headlamps, the remote start and quietness on the 08. It could have had nicer rims and higher quality sheet metal. (the trunk and lower rear quarter panels seem very cheap. I don't like the cloth on the side of my seats. It should have had a 2 -tone interior for the $33,006"

cadillac,dts,2009,floy, 01/06/2010,2009 DTS Review,4,"Overall, I like my 2009 DTS. It has a good warranty coverage and is a good riding car. I traded in a 2000 Deville for this 2009 DTS. Quality of interior material of my 2009 DTS, although good, is a step down from the quality of material in the 2000 Deville. My 2009 DTS cabin is not as quiet as was the 2000 Deville. Front headrests in the 2009 DTS are rigid, positioned awkwardly, and obstructs rear view when backing up. 2009 DTS gas mileage is poor and the bucket seats are not comfortable for a big man. Other than the aforementioned issues, everything else seems to be okay."
cadillac,dts,2009,Paul, 11/06/2010,New 2009,4,"We traded an 06 DTS for an 09 with 985 miles. We enjoyed the 06 so much we couldn't resist the opportunity to buy an almost new one at about 16K below the sticker price. As with the 06, we are not disappointed. Few cars offer the comfortable, quiet performance of the DTS. An aging design, but like a fine wine, it seems to improve each year!"
cadillac,dts,2009,martyt2, 05/08/2014,As good as anything from Europe,4,"I am a Cadillac fan.
The DTS that we have now rides as well as anything from Europe, is very smooth and powerful.
It has more features and options than a sensible person needs.
The Bose system is top of the line.
Styling is a matter of opinion.
I think it is a pretty car.
The interior is very luxurious."
cadillac,dts,2009,vfrosh, 08/03/2011,Great 2009 DTS,4,"I purchased my 2009 DTS with 29K.
I have owned it for a year.
I average 20K miles yearly.
The car has held up well.
It is a fun comfortable, fast, and pretty car.
This is my 12th caddy.
I have owned four new caddys and eight used ones.
The used caddys offer the best savings from depreciation.
I usaually purchase 2- 3 year old caddys.
I put 50K miles on my new caddys and usually average 130K on my used caddys."
cadillac,dts,2009,Spartan for Life, 05/21/2020,Smooth High End Ride,4,"The Cadillac 2009 DTS remains a high performer for use luxury cars.  I purchased mine in 2014 with only 17 thousand miles on it.  I now have 55 thousand miles (which is still low.. I garage it in the winter and use my AWD SUV)  However it is still a joy to drive.   I have friends who have luxury foreign Brands and they compliment me on the quietness and smooth feel of the ride.  Features like heated and cooled seats and moon roof are timeless.
I have had to put about $3000 worth of maintenance work over the last four years but that seems like a bargain for an eleven year old car.   Knock on wood.  North Star engines are powerful, responsive , and dependable however my previous Cadillac’s developed leaks at about 100,000 miles.  So far, no problem with this vehicle.   I certainly recommend it.  Well built, Good fit and finishes."
cadillac,dts,2010,idaspaceman, 12/22/2010,Outstanding!,5,"I test drove the Lincoln MKS, Buick Lacrosse, Lucerne, and the Lexus E350.
Hands down the DTS was a superior engine and ride., and luxury items to either be on par or superior.
Everyone will have pro's and con's...but at the end of the day it was an easy decision for me.
I know there will be some who will say it's a Grandpa vehicle...call me old, but there is nothing like the ride and luxury of a Caddy."
cadillac,dts,2010,Auto Terry, 06/14/2017,A Great Luxury Sedan!,5,"Ok, I drove many cars before picking the DTS, Lincoln was a very close second! But I choose the DTS for Ride, Comfort, Quiet Cabin and pure size. It is a big car with ROOM. When looking at Lexus, Audi, Infinity or BMW, you will spend more money. Plus you have to use premium fuel at .50 plus more per gallon ad the performance is not as smooth as the Northstar V8! On regular fuel i get 18MPG around town and have got 25 MPG on a trip, running 70MPH and our luggage and presents for the Grandkids! The professional reviews if you want to call them look toward the status symbol of a name plate. I looked at pure car comoparison not an image of how I arrive, after all isn.t that what driving a car is all about. Sure the car floats, that is luxury. What do people do buy a luxury car with real tight handling and take it to the track? Get serious. I own a Z06 Corvette for that. And I will tell you the Caddy is no slouch! Not as tight as European cars, but I bought a luxury car. The massaging seat are superb on a long drive, Bose stereo sounds great. And when I look at the dash it is straight forward, easy to use. Some of the other cars I looked at including Lexus and Toyota Avalon and the above, there were so many confusing controls that were not ergonomically designed, it made you wonder. I am driving the car not operating and airliner. Infinity, BMW and Audi were the worst set of dash controls. Now to the car, if anything breaks it is half the cost of other parts, the same base components are made in high quantities as they are on the GM cars and less than competitors. The dealer has been great. The car has only need normal wearable maintenance items. No big scheduled service appointment for required maintenance that cost $1800 like some of the others. I have taken good care of the car and the fit and finish is perfect, nothing has come loose or ever left me down! Does it look dated, no it is a classic look. And when driving it the seats are like the recliner at home, not a hugging seat with tight seat bolsters (save those for racing seats) pure comfort. The engine is smooth and steady, always there when you need power and quiet! The NAV is now a tad outdated, but that is technology. I have owned many luxury brands including Benz and some of the above and the Caddy is a keeper!

cadillac,dts,2010,Bob, 10/07/2010,Poor Build Quality,4,I've had the DTS for 3 months now.  I love everything about it except the build quality.  Ride is spectacular. Interior build is just good.  Inside window molding is lose and has a gap where you can see the edge of the window.  The outside is where the build quality looks bad.  Trim on doors does not line up.  Doors themselves do not line up.  Doors either hang higher or lower than the front or rear doors. Trim inside the trunk fell off as it was never snapped on.  Transmission leak at 1000 miles (Bolts had to be sealed).  GM just doesn't care about the DTS as they are doing away with it.  Well guess what. I'm doing away with GM. Cadillac is NOT the standard of the world as they claim. 
cadillac,dts,2010,dino29, 01/01/2011,DTS vs Avalon,4,"What are the editors drinking or inhaling comparing the Avalon to the DTS? I just completed test driving both vehicles multiple times starting out w/an open mind - The Avalon rides like a little & lighter car compared to the DTS. The trunk is significantly smaller on the Avalon & it just doesn't have the ride quality of the DTS. The overall appearance is that of a much cheaper vehicle, which the Avalon is.
I was very surprise when I looked at the expert review & found these two vehicles being compared as peers. The DTS is significantly more of a luxury vehicle in nearly all respects. 
This notion that not having a six speed trans somehow lessens the vehicle is hogwash."

The cabin area both front and rear has more than adequate room. Our friends could not believe how roomy and stately this car is. The chrome wheels really enhances the silver DTS. I previously owned a Lincoln Town Car and this DTS is far superior both in roominess and handling. DTS interior is by far more rich looking. Has an awsome stereo system. My wife and I will definetly purchase another Cadillac. We are very satisfied and throughly enjoy riding in our
DTS. MPG on the road is 20 and in town 16. We are statisfied with this."
cadillac,dts,2010,new mks owner, 10/02/2010,Cadillac does not repair problems,3,"I had a 2009 Cadillac DTS and the driver side windshield washer would not wet down the upper windshield and deposited the water in bulk right in front of the driver view through the windshield.  The passenger side washer/wiper worked perfectly.  Cadillacs replaced two wiper arms to no avail.  I reported this to Cadillac and in 6 months I was told an engineer would call me. still waiting after the case was closed twice and reopened.  I test 6 new 09 and 2010 DTS Cadillac and they all do not work . Traded the Cadillac DTS for a Lincoln MKs.  got three time more features, more luxury and a better driving automobile. no more Cadillacs in my garage."
cadillac,dts,2010,1george, 04/29/2015,Very Disappointing,2,"I always dreamed of owning a Cadillac. Now, I own a DTS and my dream is broken. I drive for Uber and looked at Lincoln Mkx,Town Car,Chrysler 300 and the DTS I selected the DTS based on back seat size and FWD.The car is comfortable and the FWD works well. However, this car rides like crap.The front end bottoms out over the slightest bump in the road. I took it to the dealer to ask about this and they told me that a lot of DTS owners complain about this problem and they told me there was nothing I can do to improve the ride.
This is the worst driving car I've ever owned."
cadillac,dts,2010,PT crusher, 03/20/2010,Great comfort even for BIG GUYS,5,"Just picked up an 08 DTS, I was driving a Dodge Ram. I've always had Trucks because I'm a big guy (6'5"" 270lbs), so I need a lot of leg room. The bouncy, loud and overpowering ride of the trucks had to go. The DTS offers plenty of room, power, comfort, and it's just a nice looking car. If I had to compare ride of the DTS. Think if you spent 30 year sleeping on the floor, and you just got a top of the line pillow top (King Koil Matress). You sleep would never be the same you wouldn't want to get out of bed. That's what driving the DTS feels like. Comfort and smooth ride like you wouldn't believe. A++"

cadillac,dts,2010,devdon, 04/07/2012,From Avalon To DTS,2,"I have now had my DTS for 2 years (23,000MI).
I think I have experience enough now to say, having owned a 09 Avalon previously....there is no comparasion.
The Avalon is far superior.
The gentlemen that said there is no comparasion has apparently not driven the Avalon.
My DTS started with front wheel balancing problems.
After ordering 2 sets for me it still feels that I'm driving it unbalanced.
And it took several attempts to get them to do that.
Fit and finish both interior and exterior are sub-par.
Road and wind noise is pronounced and the engine noise is extremely annoying.
The only reason I can see why anyone would buy one is the ""name"".
That was my reason..mistake."
cadillac,dts,2010,Marcel, 09/30/2018,Love the ride,4,"Have had and still, Suburbans for years.  Instead of trading for another this time, decided to keep and get a sedan. This Cadillac has same features as my Suburban, but is a much more comfortable and quiet ride.  Great power in the Northstar engine, plenty of passenger room, huge trunk very nice interior.  Fuel pump went out in first week but 90 day warranty and dealer contribution took care of it.  Ecpensive to repair, so consider an extended warranty taking into cosideration miles on car purchased and warranty limits.

cadillac,dts,2010,kgm0001, 11/29/2010,Compared to my 07 Town Car,3,"I've found my Town Car superior to the DTS in almost every way except: pedal position, ride, brake feel, and power (DOHC in DTS vs SOHC 4.6 L in TC). DTS engine is noisy and expansion joints cause booming throughout the structure. TC's body on frame is quieter with much less road noise. DTS steering is too firm making small corrections difficult without yanking the wheel. DTS: no locking fuel filler door; no trunk lid pull down; no trumpet horn; FWD; occupants sit too low; seems like a mid-sized car when compared to the TC. Town Car: rides too firmly; accelerator and brake pedals too close together and too far to the right; engine not as responsive as in DTS; RWD."

Onstar GPS makes getting to your destination an absolute pleasure. The ride with magna traction shocks is as great as it is on my Corvette.   "
cadillac,dts,2010,northernwisconsin, 10/24/2009,Under Rated,5,"While I have nothing against the foreign models, the repair costs for a Benz are high.  I have an 06 DTS with 36M and the car is great.  Good build quality. A great highway cruiser.  It seems like the press is locked in the 80s calling the car a floater for handling etc.  The DTS does everything expected of it with class.  The engine and trans are bulletpoof.  Local transmission shop says they never see the Caddy trans for overhaul.  The post-05 seats are excellent and fit 6 footer.  The car is no more heavy than Lexus.  The DTS design could use a freshening with some GM money.  But I have no complaints and have been pleasantly surprised at how competent the vehicle is."

cadillac,dts,2011,Bill Gobeille, 04/30/2017,Unapologetically old school luxury...,4,"Just wanted a big, solid, reliable, old fashioned American luxury car as a weekend cruiser/retirement car.  Looked for a white, low mileage, DTS Platinum edition with a brown interior for years.  It's a very popular used car with strong reliability and good ones sell fast, so you have to be on top of the search.  Finally tripped across one on Autotrader alert after a 3 year search.    The alert hit the phone, it ticked every box, clean Carfax, and the internet price was awesome (5k cheaper than 2 similar local models for sale), so I purchased.  My brother drove it up for me and so far, so good.  Beautiful car, easy to drive, and very comfortable.  Interesting observation is that the speed never gets away from you...you know that sensation when you think you're driving one speed and you're actually going much faster...this car's perceived vs actual speed is right on the money.  Other driver's take one look at it and KNOW that you're not lead footing it down the road, just enjoying the ride!  Love the blind zone and lane departure alert features, just wish that a backup camera had been offered as a feature as well.  Easy entry & exit for all passengers, tons of trunk space, amazing ride quality, upscale but not showy, and very solid /stable feeling.  Update:  Took it across country in 2018 and it was such a smooth drive.  We moved west and literally packed it to the rafters, can't believe how much we stuffed into it!  We hit heavy rain, a white out blizzard, a huge wind storm, bumper to bumper city to wide open highway driving, sea level to mountain terrain...handled it all like it was just cruising down the boulevard!  Ran it through the car wash when we arrived and it looks like new!
"
cadillac,dts,2011,JimBo, 09/24/2015,Platinum Bargain!,4,"Searched for this platinum edition for over 4 years...makes an incredible used car buy given all the stats on reliability and safety, combine that with inlaid wood and cadillac logos on the upgraded leather seats with alcantara headliner and courtesy lights...the perfect chauffeuring car for taking friends and family out to dinner or cruising down the highway is where it really shines!  You will probably think the ride is a bit rough for such a big luxury car, but getting it up to speed smooths things out.  Bought my 4 year old DTS with 32k miles at about 1/3 the MSRP...BARGAIN! Update: sold the car because I don’t keep cars long and in this case the driver’s seat was not very comfortable to me. I was able to negotiate with the dealer on trade, he thought he would be stuck with an old caddy on his Maserati lot, but I assured him the Platinum would be gone within two weeks, and because I was buying and trading two cars, he did up his price...checked back a week later and, “you were right! It didn’t make it to the weekend before someone bought it over the phone from out of town and came within a few days to pick it up. I’ll look at these platinums differently now”...I’ve seen him add several platinum Escalades to his lot in the time since! I still highly recommend the platinum!

The cars were VERY powerful and had the latest electronic advances, until around 2000 when GM had probably already decide to discontinue it. (Eldorado has older stabilitrak than Seville, etc). Being FWD, this car is has some torque steer, but its not too annoying. The Bose audio system is excellent, but most ESCs did not have it. The seating is very comfortable, but not as supportive in ESC trim. The driver info center is easy to use.  The memory personalization is also easy to set up.

cadillac,eldorado,2000,pketch, 05/19/2007,What a blast,4,"Bought used off lease. ETC Crims Pearl.How did I get so lucky?  Drives like you would expect. First year aluminum roller rocker followers. The use of premium fuel is not required. A real plus with fuel getting ready to $4. Gas milage is great for the size and power. Under estimated by EPA. 22+ around town 28+ on the road. Transmission has to be one of the best. The shift is almost unnoticible. But best off all they tell you at GM to drive it like you stole it. The G force when you punch it will set you back in your set. The styling, being that GM tried to emulate the '67 (first year) I say they nailed it. Those classic lines are all over it. In short love the car, love to drive it"
cadillac,eldorado,2000,cadillacmike, 12/22/2004,Not bad for an Eldorado,4,"I bought my used 2000 Cadillac Eldorado, because it was a Coach Builders Limited Convertible conversion. The steel roofed Eldorado was just to bugly for me with it's HUGE blind spot. Anyway, I've had it for about three months, and I think it's too bad they stopped maikng this car, beceuse it took me two years to find one here in Tampa and this is supposed to be convertible country.  Realibility: It's been ok, just an annoying intermittent remote trunk release problem, that definitely has something to do with the convertiblle top. The Northstar engine system is SUPERB. I am experiencing lots of wind noise, but it's a convertible.  It handles fine, but has a little tourque steer under hard throttle.  That's to be expected in a FWD car. "

The only reason I am replacing my ElDo is for 4 doors and room for a Rotweiller. I have loved this car, but hate lifting a sleeping grandchild out of the back seat car seat.  It is a thrill to drive, so comfortable and very luxurious. I had problems with water leaking around my moonroof but I had a great service department and so my inconvience was minor. They totally replaced my carpet twice and finally cured the leak problem.  "

cadillac,eldorado,2000,cadillacmike, 02/04/2005,Very nice running car,4,"The car I bought is a Coach Builders Limited convertible conversion, so it's a convertible. This means less interior lighting, and a SLIGHTLY smaller trunk, and of course wind noise, but it was a first class job, with an automatic hard boot that raises and lowers to cover the top. You get about 70% of the original trunk space regardless of the top position, nice wnen compared to the ""no trunk space"" problem of the popular folding hard top cars, and it seats five. The excellent Northstar system has phenomenal power and can actually run for 50 miles at 50 MPH with NO coolant. It has nearly every convienience feauer availabe from 2000, and rides very smooth and quiet (below about 70MPH)."

Gets 32 mpg on the hwy at 70 mph. No joke. Better than my Chrysler 300M with 6 cyl. Virtually no problems at all with the car. I think the seats could have had a little longer seat pad and the spare room between grill and fan could have been put in the back seat for more legroom, but having said that, the car has been great. Am looking to buy another Caddy for the wife and wish the Eldorado was still around. We will look at an STS or DeVille.  "

All that being said, My Eldorado runs PERFECT, Gets 29MPG on the road, and looks acts and feels like the thorobred she is.

The Eldorado is the pinnacle of the 2-door luxury sport coupes as far as I'm concerned.  The interior is comfortable, quiet, roomy (for it's style), and well built.

It uses regular fuel and I get 28 mpg on the highway.  With a strong tailwind, I get 30 to 34.  Pretty incredible for a V-8.  And lots of power, good brakes.  I had a Troféo with 300,000 + miles and the ESC was the best substitute I could find.  Interior styling is not as luxurious as the Oldsmobile.  But the power and mpg make up for it.  Since their is no other American luxury coupe and Chevrolet refuses to upgrade the Monte Carlo, I may buy another ESC or ETC and rotate the two until GM comes to their senses about what we want.  Overweight gas guzzlers can't be our future."

I should have known then. Over its life, it has had four dead batteries, over $2,000 so far in electrical repairs, and latest is over 7 days in the shop with 24 indicators in the computer. The GM tech center is taking bets on what the problem is. Many parts have been replaced, so far including the computer itself. This is the last Cadillac I will ever own (first one was an '84, remember those engines that blew up?).  I have never owned a ""foreign"" car, but this one has done it.

Turn the key to start and you will immediately feel the quality of this fine car. Watch the tach to see if it is running. The starter hardly makes a sound. Acceleration and power are excellent. Drive it gently at freeway speed and gas mileage will be well above 20mpg. I owned a '93 eldo for over 4 years then sold to a neighbor. That was not a good move but now the new one I intend to keep at least the next 10 years.

cadillac,elr,2014,BigW, 11/06/2015,Wow - Get One If You Can Find One,5,"I'd never bought an electric car before, so I researched the heck out of this thing before I bought it.  I probably read every review and watched every video review out there.  Then I went out and drove the car.  Going in, I expected it to be very much a mixed bag, with some big compromises I might be able to live with given the heavily discounted price.

What I found instead was an absolutely stellar car that just didn't fit the conventional narrative and has really slipped through the cracks.   

Is it a modern sports car?  No.  But it has plenty of power, nice handling, etc.  The disconnect between what some reviewers said and the car's actual performance was breathtaking.  In the kind of driving we all do in the real world, it will give you absolutely nothing to complain about.  It looks like it ought to be able to take on a Porsche 911 and it isn't that fast, but that is the only way in which the driving dynamics will disappoint you.  

Is it a eco-warrior statement car?  No.  No one will actually realize that you are driving something that is better for the environment than a Prius.  So people who want to wear that on their sleeves will hate it because it doesn't make an eco-statement.  Also, it is far too plush and luxurious to give off that ""I'm sacrificing for the good of the planet"" vibe.  

Is it a traditional luxury car?   Not really.  It is much more sporty and nimble than a traditional luxury car.  The ride is smooth and well-composed, not floaty at all. However, the interior is all luxury car, and the levels of quiet are better than any luxury car I've ever seen.  

What it really is, is a car purpose-built for the real and relatively uninteresting driving we actually do in the real world.  You don't need a huge V8 to putter along in commuter traffic.  You don't need a bone-crushing suspension that handles well but beats you up every mile when you only see those twisty car commercial roads in car commercials.

In the real world, quiet matters.  In the real world, power matters but only up to a point.   In the real world, handling and ride quality need to be thoughtfully balanced.   In the real world, you shouldn't waste gas getting to work, even when it is cheap.   The ELR does every one of those things well, all while looking absolutely amazing.  

Yes, the backseat is tiny.  Yes, it should not have sold for $80k initially.  But that is about as far as the legitimate criticisms go. 

With gas prices low, these things are selling for absolutely absurd prices.  They are very rare, so finding one can be a challenge.  But if you land one, you will end up with an amazing bargain.
"
cadillac,elr,2014,Gene, 02/18/2016,ELECTRIC LUXURY ROADSTER,5,"That's what ELR stands for. Coming from a Volt, I found a 2014 with 9000 miles on it as a great ""owners"" car considering my lease is coming up very quickly. It's a head turner, people gather around it, they look, they stare and while it's OK with me, it gets unnerving after while. I watch where I park, especially at places like the supermarket, home depot, etc. It is rare to see on the road. It's a partner when you want to drive it in an economical fashion. It's FASTER than the Volt. It handles BETTER than the volt. Forget about passengers. Forget about lots of storage. I took my 65"" TV home in my Volt. Forget about it with the ELR. It screams success, it's a very special car. I hate to drive it in the rain, I hate it when it gets dirty, I wax it all the time. 

I get 40+ miles on EV alone. On gas, I dont compete with MPG as I just floor it. Engine sounds a bit loud, it's ok.

20's from the factory and it's all good.

Update.....it's 8/25/17 now....

Still get stares, looks and endless compliments. I now own a '16 GTR Nismo and I get just as much looks and compliments On the ELR as the GTR. 

Reliable, fun and top of the food chain feelings.

cadillac,elr,2014,rowley123, 06/13/2014,ELR beats Tesla S hands down!!,5,"I wanted a luxury electric car and thought Tesla was the way to go UNTIL I saw the CADILLAC ELR.
This car is the way to go if you are looking for a high end electric car that is fun to drive and practical.
The all electric cars concerned me since you HAD to plan a long distance trip around charging.
The ELS, however has a 9 gallon gas tank there to power the generator to make more electricity- how awesome is that!!! (It is NOT a hybrid with a gasoline engine).
 My only fault is with the rear seat size - but lets face it, the population that drives an ELR is not running kids to dance lessons - you are way past that! (or have a mini van for the ""family car"".) 
Update 6/2017 --- I have since traded this ELR in for a new XT5 since I get a new car every two or three years tops.   Unfortunately the ELR didn't catch with Tesla buyers as a BETTER electric car, yet it remained a ""head turner"" right until the end. I still maintain that until  technology puts a charging station at every ""gas station"" and that electric charging time does not exceed the the time to gas-up, (5-min.) that an electric car with a back up gasoline source to power the generator when you exhaust the charge is the only way to go.

cadillac,elr,2014,Joe Manley, 08/15/2016,I still love it after a year,5,"One year ago I bought a new, no mile, 2014 Model with every option and Kona brown interior. It stickered for over 82K  and I bought it for 46k plus tax and registration. I got a $2,000 check from the state, a $500 rebate from the electric company and the $7,500 federal rebate brought the price down another 10 grand to 36k plus tax and registration. The car is simply stunning. It's beautiful inside and out. Whenever I park it I still look back and smile. It's a joy to drive, all the electronics are simple to operate, suspension is superb, plenty of power and the interior is just gorgeous, comfortable and just works. I usually get around 45 miles one a charge. My commute is 44 miles and when I get home unless it's really cold I will still have one or two miles left or will have just run out of charge a mile or so away. When I drive on the weekends the gas engine gets great mileage and I have never been able to hear when it turns on or off. I still get compliments everywhere I go. I have almost 13k miles on the odometer now and have not had one mechanical failure of any sort. Trouble free and stylish-just love this car.

Without too much effort, I can make my 40 mile round trip on electric only.   This isn't a fun car you want to rip up mountain roads in; that's not what it's designed to do.  It's designed to cart you around town in a quiet, luxurious cocoon that is still responsive and fun to drive.  
Having the engine backup is vital.  There's no way I could do an EV with less than 100 miles of range without being constantly paranoid that I'd run out of juice.  The ELR solves that problem.  You can milk the batteries for all they've got, then the motor kicks in to keep you going.  "
cadillac,elr,2014,Tuba player, 08/16/2018,Traded Volt for upgrade,5,"Purchased this car from the dealer that had used it for 10,000 miles as a loaner but had not charged the batteries regularly. Lifetime mileage was only 38 mpg when I picked it up but has increased to 65.5 while I drove the next 13000 miles. The performance is a little better than the Chevrolet Volt due to suspension and computer improvements. The availability of power seats, adaptive cruise control, and general luxury interior was justification for trading a 2 year old car and extending payments 2 more years. Adjusting seats while traveling is easy and helps with old age arthritis. Not as practical for hauling as the hatchback Volt but we always have a truck to get things done. I have been using the car locally and most months I don’t buy gas. Last summer took a 1500 mile trip without plugging in and averaged 37 mpg, mostly 70+ mph.

cadillac,elr,2014,DP Mendel, 01/28/2019,2014 ELR Off-Lease Steal,5,"While I did get an ELR with 42,000 miles, it also came with a $57,300 discount! Should also be noted that the gas motor currently has only about 9000 miles on it so this vehicle should easily surpass 250,000 combined miles as long as the electric motor is as good as they seem to be. Wonderful car for a commute of 10-15 miles to work each day. Can also plug in while at work and still run errands after work without worrying about running out of charge. Have been going about 4 months and 4000 miles on each tank of gas. The range does drop from 40 to 30 miles in the winter time and the vehicle does run the gas engine when it is cold outside to maintain winter HVAC needs. Would be nice if the winter engine use settings could be adjusted. Overall a great car for someone who doesn't need a back seat for anything more than emergency use.

This vehicle is well engineered. The only negative is it takes over twelve hours to fully recharge the electric battery unless you have the upgraded charging unit.

cadillac,elr,2014,ELR Man, 04/01/2020,Luxurious Economy/Comfort with Style,5,"Style like no other modern day automobile.  Great comfort for two and super economical to drive.  Blind spots are not as bad as you might think and, of course, the back-up camera helps.  Performance is very good, handling is great, ride is adjustable - four settings from touring to all out performance and mountain driving with the tip of the finger.  Wind noise is non existent but a little road noise is present with the Z rated performance tires currently on the car.  I will opt for good all season radials when replacement is required.

I bought mine used with 55000 miles last September (2019) so the ""big"" depreciation was gone.  Price was less than a later model Chevy Camaro but there is no comparison between the two.  Because so few were built (about 2500 2014 models) they could become somewhat of a collectable.  I'll probably never see that in my lifetime but who knows.  In the meantime I will enjoy it all I can.

cadillac,elr,2016,Eric Rotbard, 05/09/2016,The perfect electric personal luxury coupe v.2,5,"Having leased a 2014 Cadillac ELR (and 2011 Chevy Volt before it), the bar was already set very high.  Contrary to the comments of many online detractors, the ELR is -not- simply a dressed up Volt.  As any EV advocate should tell you, the fact that the Volt and ELR have the same powertrain configuration does not mean they are the same car.  That would be like arguing that any internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) is the same as any other because they both have similar engines and transmissions.  In an EV, what is a battery but the EV analog to an ICEV gas tank?  No one would argue two cars are the same because they have the same gas tank.  And the electric motor (be it in a Tesla, Leaf or Volt) is very similar in design from the original EV1 days, so it is more of a one size fits all part far more than the engine and transmission which need to be properly mated to the vehicle application.  Lastly, the ICE in the Volt and ELR are designed primarily to provide electricity rather than mechanical energy (although it does that too in limited circumstances).  What differentiates the Volt and ELR, then is the software and performance tuning (and the fact that the electric motor is more robust to handle the extra hp and torque).  The Volt and ELR provide vastly different driving experiences.  Other than the fact that both are silent,  you would never confuse driving one for the other.

I had previously said that the 2014 ELR was the perfect electric personal luxury coupe.  It may not be as fast as a Model S, but it had plenty of torque.  Also, whereas the Model S is beautiful, practical, spacious sedan, the beauty of the ELR is that it is the opposite: it is designed to be a personal car first and foremost, not a family car.  It is not practical, nor is it intended to be.  The 2014 ELR was -exactly- what I wanted: a personal car that can transport my family in a pinch.  In my opinion, it is one of the most beautiful expressions of automotive design in history, both inside and out.  I thought I could not be happier with the 2014 ELR...

... until I drove the 2016 ELR.  Cadillac increased its performance, refined its handling, upgraded its CUE infotainment system with faster processing, more features, and enhanced the interface, and lowered the price.  I had to have it, so I managed to transfer my 2014 ELR lease, and leased a new one.  

After having an ELR for 2 years, I still enjoy simply looking at it.  The new '16 ELR is the perfect expression of Cadillac's Art & Science design theme, and is an absolute joy to drive.  I cannot praise it enough.
"
cadillac,elr,2016,Lance Jordan, 06/30/2017,Best car I've ever owned!,5,"This car is hands down the best car I've ever had. I have gotten up to 50 miles on an electric charge. I average around 40mpg or more on the generator, no range anxiety of that of a Tesla. It has a super high end interior, the bose system rocks and the seats are comfortable. Its has ever tech feature you need. The acceleration is strong on the low end. The weight distribution is good, since the weight of the batteries are in the center of the car. Handles like a dream, stops on a dime. The styling is a thing of beauty. I love the car, no complaints whatsoever.
"
cadillac,elr,2016,SAM, 06/06/2016,You Should Road Test a 2016,5,"There are great deals available.  The ELR is discontinued and will certainly become a collectors item.  As battery technology improves, it is conceivable ELR battery replacement will become available.  This is a car to keep... My 2016 Sport is fast, comfortable, provides great MPGe and is an overall thrill to drive all the time.  Cadillac has no idea about marketing and have made a huge mistake by ending its life.  I took it to a Cadillac event in NJ recently and everyone was incredibly impressed.  Every new Caddy should have a plug-in option and offer technology upgrades as they become available, similar to Tesla.  Also, the idiot auto bloggers and journalists haven't a clue when it comes to what people want.  It is not always about 0-100.  There is not 1 test on a 2016 ELR I can find.

cadillac,elr,2016,Dr Tasso Pappas, 09/18/2016,Dr Tasso Pappas recommends 1 a day 4 work and play,5,"In over 30000 miles I have fallen in love with this auto. These are the most comfortable front seats I have ever seen!,,, The headrests are the best in my 20 years of many new and used cars.  I commute 1000 a week and with using my level 2 charger overnight I average 54 miles per gallon. The stereo sounds amazing. The CUE system beats that of my Buick and my Yukon.

The ElR. Is an impressive vehicle. The seats are simply the best in comfort of any vehicle I have owned. Although the lack lateral support, the comfort is a 10.  The ride is a good balance between sport and cruising. No issues besides a need to replace the intellibeam sensor.

We also own a BMW i3 and GM's quality and implementation of hybrid technology is dramatically better. Great vehicle.

Looks great and always draws a crowd,  Don't believe the ""professional reviews, this car has plenty of acceleration.  Look at what the owners say.  All 5 star.  I have a 220 plug at work so for my commute I never buy gas or pay for electric.  Company gets a tax break, so we all win.  Interior is the best of any car I have owned.  Traded a Porsche Boxter S for it, and could not be happier.  Go get one, if you can find one of the 3000 Caddi made.  If you do you will own one of the most limited edition luxury cars on the road.  Oh, it is a green vehicle as well.  So feel good about you!
"
cadillac,elr,2016,Plug in with range extendr fan, 05/29/2019,This is an excellent car,5,"Anyone looking at this car probably has a clue... don't buy this (used at least 3 year old car at the time of this writing) if you want a:
1: Pickup truck and need the room
2: need a van or big hatchback because you haul so much stuff
3: This is to be your only car unless you never haul anything of size
4: Have 3 kids that you need to haul around
5: Need a testosterone boost and an extension of your manhood with asphalt burning acceleration and/or big Porsche engine sounds
6: Really want some long range EV and don't care about the fact that you have a range extending gas engine or don't care about range anxiety.

Do think about one of these cars (2016) if you want a drop dead great looking car that pictures can't accurately display how nice this car looks in person, with an interior quality that can only be bested by a car costing 3 times it's price when new. If you like regen type driving like a Volt, i3, IPace, you got it in L mode, but with the regen on demand paddle you get regen at double the rate of the normal one pedal driving- it's excellent and highly useful. I never even see dirt on my front wheels from the usual brake pad dust/brake fluid vapor like on most cars. Using the regen paddle and normal regen type of driving makes using the brake a rarity. Car is so reliable, problems are rare and few. Drives great and Voltec technology is very well thought out. Car is way better than I even imagined. Super happy with it! Don't believe idiot reviews from car magazine writers. If you understand what the car is all about before you buy and are okay with it, you will be a happy ELR owner. The reviews on this site are wrong! Here's what they say:

    Still has a lofty base price - No matter now, at used  they're an exc deal!
    noisy gasoline engine - I don't even notice mine, unless going up steep hill
    claustrophobic backseat - Untrue, anyone under 5-10"" can fit just fine
    tiny trunk with narrow access - Not THAT small, there's way smaller 
    touchscreen can be slow to respond - Nope -2016 fixed all that.
    continued use of the original Chevrolet Volt powertrain. Not true, it's way tweaked and way better, so that's just not a good statement making it sound the same - it's not!

All in all, I would highly recommend this car to folks wanting a 2 door, maybe no kids, especially with normal 50 mile and under driving per day. regen paddle ALONE will make me keep this car for a long time, not even counting it's great looks! It even came with great looking wheels - a rarity on cars.

cadillac,elr,2016,2016 ELR owner, 09/17/2019,Love my 2016 ELR,5,"After several years of looking at the usual cast of long-range plug-ins (Tesla S and 3, Volt, etc), I finally test drove an off lease 2016 ELR when I saw one in our area. (60 miles away).  It took 15 seconds of driving the car to make a decision-a beautiful interior, fantastic sound system, great acceleration, spectacular design-instant joy. With 16k miles (off lease), it was about the cost of a new Volt (32K).  After 6 months owning and using the car every day, it is still like a mini-vacation when I close the door and start driving.

The interior is all Cadillac-it is beautiful.  We have owned several Cadillacs (cars and SUVs) as well as several other cars (Infinity, BMW)-the interior of the ELR is gorgeous and the seats/feel driving are similar to the CTS4 we owned and loved-though with instant torque and about 4-5x the gas mileage! 

I have a 35 mile round trip commute and never use gas despite using the standard wall plug in charger which takes exactly 20 seconds a day to plug in to the car. Although not necessary for my driving, the game of using paddles instead of brakes to see how far you can go on the battery is actually pretty addictive. So far 45 miles is my best.  

I also use the car to drive long distances and the ability to not think about charging has been awesome. Even in straight up gas mode, the car gets pretty spectacular mileage  without really trying (34-36 mpg in my experience)-remember this is a 3000+lb Cadillac!  After 6 months and about 10K driving (filling the gas tank about once a month), I have averaged about 79 mpg in mixed use with a number of 200+ mile trips. 

Acceleration and power are great in ""either"" mode (as it is all mediated through the electric drive train) and the heralded engine noise is actually pretty sedate unless you are flooring the car when the battery is empty. If a throaty engine sound when hitting the gas is what you seek, this is not the car for you. 

The trunk has more than enough room to handle a full hockey equipment bag (about 2 golf bags in size)-though my sticks require using one of the fold down seats.  With both seats down, there is actually a lot of unobstructed room -though you may feel some guilt sullying the car.

I bought the car in Mid-New Jersey (Gold Coast Cadillac -who were great) but live in the Philadelphia area and have found getting the car serviced was not an issue-something I was worried about given the low numbers produced.

Overall, my ELR has proven to be a spectacular car. Absolutely love driving it.  Perhaps overpriced when first introduced and with a pretty amusing (courtesy Neil McDonough)/polarizing marketing campaign, they are a great option if you can find one. 
"
cadillac,elr,2016,Dennis, 08/07/2018,Great car,5,"Love it.

"
cadillac,elr,2016,R.H. MacLaughlin, 11/30/2018,Smitten!,5,"Well, I acquired this on one of those screaming lease deals...zero down/$499 a month.

The sticker price was too expensive for me to consider to buy, but I thought it was a unique vehicle, and having gone through a Nissan Leaf and two Ford C-Max Energis, I wanted to stick with a plug-in; the freedom from gasoline stations is a subtle lifestyle enhancement that I would never trade away...AND, remember the commercial about the Chevy Volt owner who puts gas into her car so seldom that she forgets how...?  ME! I forget all the time...but they put the gas tank release in the door so it isn’t in the most intuitive spot... So far, I have averaged 115MPG over the life of the lease. 

Three years ago I started my life with this car and was sort of  troubled by the exclusivity, the beauty, the speed, the quietness...everything about this car is meant to make you feel calmer, and stress free—except the looks.  Everyone asks about it, gawks at it, drools over it, insists there is a “V” version.  This car is way too fine a vehicle for a fifty-something dad.  

Now, three years later, with the lease about to expire, I am paralyzed at the thought of a day without this gorgeous car.  What am I to do? Buy it? Or Buy a new, lesser car? Decisions decisions.

I have a few gripes. 1. The USB port is inside a cubby that my hand does not fit into (thus, being a dad does have its rewards). 2. A manual parking break...really? Even my wife’s Kia engineered that away. 3. No ventilated seats...??? Again, Kia..."

cadillac,escalade-ext,2003,abadboy, 03/01/2003,Bad Boy Toy,5,"INCREDIBLE! The room, the power, mine 
is s'charged with almost 600 hp. The 
look, black with 24"" ASA wheels from 
the Tire Rack(a must have). Everyone 
wants a ride or there picture with it. 
Like being a rock star. Don't 
buy one if you don't want the 
attention. No one can get enough of 
this BAD BOY! Never considered a 
Cadillac before. Everyone said 
Cadillacs are old guys cars, now 
everyone looks to me for a ride. The 
ultimate in excess, over the top in 
your face truck! This BAD BOY ROCKS! 
Made a trip to Vegas the first weekend 
I had it, couldn't beleive the looks we 
got, or how everyone moved to the right 
to let this BAD BOY go past. INCREDIBLE!"

cadillac,escalade-ext,2003,Lovemyext, 12/03/2003,You get what you pay for...,4,"I've only had this truck for less than 
a week and I am totally in love.  I've 
owned numorus Cadillac cars over the 
years and I was always impressed with 
the level of comfort.  However, I have 
always owed a pickup truck as well.  
Now, this way I can kill two birds with 
one stone.  My EXT might not get as 
many looks as an H2.  But I know for a 
fact the guy behind the wheel of that 
H2 is not NEARLY as comfortable as I am 
in this truck.  And the H2 might be 
bigger but I also know I can out run 
him with the awsome power this caddy 
has under it's hood. "

it has every thing. I get great mileage 
on the escalade and have lots of fun 
driving around town in it. The seat are 
comfortable and the color of the 
outside and the inside are outstanding. 
As much money as I have out into this 
vehical it has givin me so much more 
back. I think every body needs to have 
a cadillac escalade you will never 
regreat buying this vehical it is such 
a good car. I want to thank the company 
for making such a realiable truck. 
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!"

expensive-it is GREAT! I love 
everything about my Escalade. I was

The features are great with this car!!!"
cadillac,escalade-ext,2003,JEN3NASCAR, 04/03/2003,A CLASS ACT...,4,"The Cadillac EXT is a truly dream 
machine...my husband ordered this 
vehicle as a surprise, and had every 
available option put on it (we had 
admired them ever since they hit the 
market)...the attention to detail is 
something to be appreciated.  The 
thing is a class act, from bumper to 
bumper, and the interior is 
total ""Cadillac comfort"" throughout.  
It is amazing how agile this vehicle 
is, considering its size...you have to 
drive an EXT to experience how well it 
handles.  It has plenty of ""get up and 
go""...very responsive. Be warned-If 
you decide to take and EXT for a spin, 
it will be love and first drive, and 
you will be hooked! :)"
cadillac,escalade-ext,2003,SLT, 12/31/2008,Best Truck out there,4,"This has got to be the best truck I have owned! I bought it used to see if they are really truck worthy and yes they are! Great power, comfortable ride, all the bells and whistles, and beautiful looking! Get a lot of compliments from a lot of people. Does awesome in the Colorado snow, went up some hills that I didn't think I could go up, but it cruised right up with no problem!! This is the all around vehicle for families. Towing, running around, or just cruising, this is the ultimate Cadillac. I will most definitely be getting a 2009 model soon! Love these trucks!"

my first love(auto).The neighbors  
chat, and 
 Men and WOMEN everywhere have to 
comment on the truck.The seats, sound 
system, and utility are all A+++. Long 
drives are tireless. 

 We did Christmas shopping for eight in 
one day in the rain. We had a 12 ft 
tree tied to the bed and must have 
looked liked Santa's modern Sleigh 
(w/345 reindeers under the hood)!

 It will tow 6,000 pounds on a 6% grade 
uphill at well over the speed limit, 
while having sufficient chassis, 
suspension, and brakes to make it safe, 
easy, and fun. It drives in the rain 
like it's on rails. I'd buy another.

realized it was leaking oil. Took it 
back and it was repaired. Dealing with 
the dealership about the little bugs 
with a new car was a nitemare but the 
truck is incredible. Fast, smooth great 
sound system. I even had the chance to 
race an acura with it and won... not 
off the line but after a few seconds I 
cought up and passes them. It's big 
though... can't be affraid of driving 
if you are buying this truck"
cadillac,escalade-ext,2003,Gator , 11/19/2003,Outstanding,4,"Great vehicle but some suggested 
improvements. One be sure and check on 
delivery for a trailer hitch pkg, this 
is not a standard feature? I got it 
thrown in after purchase with little 
effort but could have been a $400.00 
mistake. Also more ground clearance 
would be nice.I understand this is not 
a true off road vehicle but for $57,000 
loaded with all wheel drive you should 
have better off road options.(Standard 
Ford or Dodge 4X4 ROAD clearance would 
make this vehicle perfect 3-4 inches 
higher.) "
cadillac,escalade-ext,2003,david minarik, 12/01/2003,ext experience,4,"Replacing my pickup, i bought the ext. 
a good and bad move. The first month, 
I didn't see it. Three times it 
stranded me, and had to file a 
complaint with the BBB. The truck is 
now running fine, but GM still hasn't 
called back.  The truck is a good ride 
with lots of power,  and I've hauled 
12 ft lumber in it without a problem. 
Definitely overpriced!"

higher than the Avalanche, the 
features, performance and comfort more 
than make up for it. I have 4k miles on 
mine and so far it has been trouble 
free. Only complaint is gas milage is 
terrible. I am averaging 12 mpg city 
and not much better highway. Its alot 
of fun to drive and pulls a 30 ft 7500 
lb travel trailer with ease."
cadillac,escalade-ext,2003,javarob, 03/09/2003,Best Ever Vehicle : The Uber-Truck,4,"I bought in December with some 
reservations.  Perhaps it cost too 
much.  Perhaps it was too big of a 
vehicle.  I thought it was beautiful, 
however, and I loved the drive.  If I 
bought a sedan, I would need to rent a 
truck at times.  The first week I was 
amazed with the compliments.  Every day 
I drove it I found something more that 
I liked.  After one month, I was 
excited at every opportunity to drive 
it.  Sometimes when I drive it I find 
myself thinking it is the greatest 
vehicle man has ever built.  That may 
be extreme, but I have never been more 
pleased with a car or truck that I have 
owned."

If you are looking for luxury, but still want the ruggedness of a truck, this is it. I highly recommend it. The Bose audio is decent, but you really need a sub to go with it. It is fun to drive. The factory chrome wheels will do for a while, but I really need to upgrade to bigger rims. Overall, I like the exterior and interior styling and the performance is there when you need it."
cadillac,escalade-ext,2004,William J Mammone, 04/30/2007,2004 Escalade EXT ownership,4,Very glad I purchased this vehicle. It rides and handles and tows great. Comfortable and easy to drive. It can carry people or items 8' long with the midgate down. Suits all of my needs.

is smooth and solid.  Steering effort

standard features on the vehicle 
including StabiliTrack, AWD, heated 
seats & mirrors, soft leather 
everywhere, excellent Bose stereo 6 
disc CD, adjustable pedals, ON STAR, 
voice activated phone, on and on.  This 
vehicle is utility, luxury, sportiness, 
ruggedness, and attention-getting all

only have put the first thousand but 
what a delight, GM can build a vehicle 
as good as any other country, this is 
my 40th new GM product and never 
happier with any before, was just about 
to go to the other side, thanks for the 
Cadallic EXT.
First tank of gas was great, at least 
2/3mpg better than the denali, same set

good milage with big vehicle, so happy 
when it happens."

The only problem I have had is with the navigation system not working correctly and a whining in the front drivetrain but they were both fixed by the dealership."

can say it's a hoot to drive.  My wife 
had a Lexus RX300 and I had a Tahoe

both of us to consolidate our needs

winding up and down curves of the Sea

I have found that the driving experience with the EXT has been nothing short of great. It will turn on a dime and I have found that when parking in tight spots it handles beautifully.  If I were going to buy another vehicle I would seriously consider buying another EXT. The power of the engine will get you out and about without any hesitation.  I have also noticed that in the year that I have driven it the gas mileage has increased substantially.

But I definitely wanted something utilitarian, good looking, and well built. It also would have to provide a comfortable ride if I chose to drive it on out-of-town trips. Then one evening...just before the dealership was about to close, I walked into the indoor showroom of our local Cadillac dealership and....'voila'. The EXT really struck both myself and my wife as something to consider. Within a few days we struck a 'deal' (a little pricey, but fair...). Now we marvel at how close we came to our targetted goals in purchasing a new SUV-type vehicle. It's a neat package. If only everyone might want to buy one"

In the Escalade EXT, I get a bigger, sturdier vehicle, with the same luxuries (if not more), and it's so much fun to drive.   "

I drove the 2003 for two and a half years, before trading it for my 2006.  The 2006's ride is a lot smoother, and is more comfortable. I drive from Georgia to Florida a least once a month, so the comfort and room that the EXT provides definately suits my needs.  When I am at home, I use the EXT around our farm to carry feed and hay, it is a workhorse also."

Although you can feel the weight behind the truck, the ride comfort and performance are excellent.  I love the functionality of having a truck for the occasional tow and the ability to haul the periodic large purchase.  I traded my 2004 Silverado LT for the refinement of the Cadillac.  Despite the fact that the two vehicles are completely incomparable the only downfall to the Cadillac is that it is too gorgeous to get dirty.  The EXT is definitely a head-turner.  I think GM has the most market for the high-end truck.  However, if the functionality of having a truck didn't prevail, my wife liked the BMW X5's interior over the Escalade's."

This truck drives and handles like you cannot believe.  The dealer gave me a new Escalade SUV to drive until my EXT came in two weeks later.  It drove fantasticly as does my EXT.  The driving experience is night and day between the earlier models and the redesigned '07.  This is my first EXT and it is a blast.  I have been given a lot of ""nice truck"" comments with the SUV's, but man they are coming fast and furius with the EXT...heads turning every which way.  Only bad thing...I paid full list for the EXT. Ouch!  Well to be the first on the block I guess you have to pay to play...lol."

However, does not feel quite as quick as my 04 EXT, that only had a 4 speed automatic & 345 HP. Acceleration from lower speeds feels like the engine's power is not fully making it to the wheels. Acceleration from higher freeway speeds is awsome. This vehicle does so many things well, that it is hard for me to consider driving anything else. Let's see, It has nice overall styling, great power, luxury seating / interior & comforts that match just about any luxury vehicle, plus tremendious utility. Could use an MP3, bluetooth hook-up, and more cubby storage spaces inside.Those minor things aside, a safe practical vehicle for many purposes. "

It was well worth the wait.  It has superb styling and comfort, beautiful Diamond White paint, 22"" wheels and best of all NO sunroof!  The Escalade EXT has excellent power and great handling for a truck, but terrible fuel economy.  Also, the lack of interior storage space is disappointing, it does not even have a sunglasses holder like my Suburbans had. The console storage is very limited and anything stored in the top part is dumped around every time the lower console is accessed.  It has a great instrument panel layout. The heated/cooled seats are very comfortable. I love the heat for my sore old back!  This truck has superb headlights and driving lights."

cadillac,escalade-ext,2007,Dave, 11/25/2006,2007 Cadillac Escalade EXT,3,The 2007 Escalade EXT is my 3rd Cadillac truck. I miss the sun visors from prior models. My 2003 had two visors with a pull out for the 3rd visor. Now there is only one and you are forced to set in a different position to keep the Florida sun out of your eyes. The tailgate is a total design flop. The painted surface sticks up higher than the black deck. If you use it as a TRUCK you will soon see all the paint gone on the edge of the tail gate. Probably like all vehicles the price went up and the quality went down hill.

I am not crazy about the 6 speed trans. because it is always shifting, and I am experiencing a severe vibration when in overdive. The dealer I bought this from has a top notch service department and they think this might have something to do with the trans. or the differential, either way it only has 1,000 miles on it and there shouldn't be anything wrong."

At this point I don't see my going to any other type if and when I purchase another one."

Don't know if it was the new '08 diesel 6.4L or what, but fuel economy was miserable, 12mpg in town, 16mpg on interstate with no towing. I also missed the versatility of the Avalanche: side cargo bins, heavy duty covers, waterproof rear bed, and the expandable bed size. Not only that, but the EXT adds significant comfort and features: NAV, DVD entertainment, heated/cooled seats, luxurious and beautiful interior, and great looks. Take it easy on the gas pedal and you'll be getting 15-16mpg in town, 20mpg on the interstate. Hauls tools, gear, toys, and projects with ease. The ultimate upgrade!"

The buying experience was great as the dealership, coral cadillac, was a pleasure to deal with to the drive of the truck anything but that of a truck. Smooth over any type of road.  It looks great (Black with the 22"" chrome rims!). I can put my sons go-kart in the back and makes trips to Home depot easier.

cadillac,escalade-ext,2008,Cesar, 03/13/2016,[non-permissible content removed] 400hp suv/truck,5,"The title describes this vehicle to the fullest. it is not a vehicle that you buy for fuel economy,it is not a fuel saver by any means. This a 400 horse power beast with a big engine and all wheel drive capabilities. This vehicle fits my needs and wants spot on when it comes to running around with the kids sports equipment  and golf outings with the boys to cleaning it up and showing up to my Corp. meetings . I've driven it in the snow up and down the hills with no problems multiple times. The kids love the rear DVD and joy taking the long trips in it.

It not bad during winter but I live in Texas and you know it get hot. When A/C is on this truck will not shift right (been in to dealership repeatly, even the Owner of Dealership took it for a week and GM refuses to to fix it, told me to live with it or they would trade me out with imtimidation as trade difference.(I have bought several CADS.

It could be better if they could add basic techs stuff that cheap Japanese cars have, otherwise a fun car to drive and to look at. Hope the dealer stop calling me for extending warranty.  "

Bed cover leaks, dealer does not tell you that, but, it is in the vehicles manual (now who reads this before buying). The back seat is useless. I am 5'2"" and rode in the back seat for 200 miles and was never so uncomfortable! Maybe a child could, I say maybe! I am pleased with the towing ability that is great. As far as 14 mpg.  I consistently get 12.5"
cadillac,escalade-ext,2009,GregS96, 03/04/2010,"Good Vehicle, Overpriced",4,"At 5,000+ miles, driven in a wide range of weather conditions, terrain, and road conditions, I can honestly say that I am happy to own this American vehicle...at the price I paid for it (below invoice, 0%/5yr financing, business tax deduction).  Traded on a '08 Toyota Tundra (great vehicle), it compares favorably in comfort, ride, performance, handling and economy.  However, with a $15k higher list price, it should be much better, with more modern features (i.e.; adaptive cruise, lane departure warnings, etc)."
cadillac,escalade-ext,2009,Rich Trayler, 09/02/2018,Escalade EXT Excellence,5,"Even after 9 years and 140,000 miles our EXT is an excellent vehicle, especially for long road trips.  Only negatives are that it is a little difficult to park in tight parking places and the gas mileage is lower than we would like - 15 mpg city and 20 hwy (but considering the size of the vehicle, these are acceptable to us.)  We have an optional bed slide and this is an outstanding option that makes it easy to access all of the bed storage area.
"
cadillac,escalade-ext,2010,Richard, 08/04/2010,Excellent,4,"Overall very pleased. I do a lot of highway and city driving, and the the EXT belies its body-on frame truck body as it is a dream on the highway and is more then manageable in the city. Tow and 9500 Pound trailer and the engine never strains at all, it's very easy to forget you're towing anything. "
cadillac,escalade-ext,2012,gam7, 09/02/2014,brakes 2012 Escalade EXT,4,"Recently purchase a 2012 Escalade EXT. Only had 690 miles.  Thought I was getting the cream of SUV's.  Find the car lacking in several areas based on the purchase price. However what I consider to be a major issue is the brakes.  The EXT is a 6,00 pound truck.  The brakes are way to small to stop the EXT in a panic stop.   GMC should be ashamed to put that truck on the road with the brakes it has.  Have had two near crashes.  I'm 77 years old and have never experienced a near rear end collision before.   When compared to a Chrysler product the EXT in the area of brakes gets a solid ""D"" !   

Would be interested in other Escalade owners experiences.  Gary...   

I have since installed new rotors and pads, a SUPERCHARGER, and cold air intake.  The performance is amazing for a 6,000 pound truck.  Unless I really get into it the milage has improved.  and the engine really likes the supercharger.  Still needs better brakes !

Sept. 3,2017    Still driving the 2012 supercharged Escalade EXT.  No issues.  Really like the performance for a 6,000 lb truck.

cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,?, 01/01/2009,Smooth Ride,5,This is my third Escalade. Hybrid is very quiet. The 2007 was really loud. Very smooth acceleration. Ride is 75% better than 2007 vehicle. The bluetooth is great to have although should have been available on the 2007. Hybrid gets 18-19 on average which for me is acceptable. Love the vehicle. Do not drive like a full size sport utility. Best large SUV on the road. Have driven it 4K miles. Flawless.
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,Bill, 10/25/2008,Excellent value,5,"Had it for a week.  My wife's vehicle. She Loves it.  Tim, the owner of the Dealership, explained and oriented the vehicle for 45 minutes with my wife.  She was very Impressed with the vehicle and the time put in to explain everything by Tim.  We traded a Lexus LX-470 in on it.  Got tired of 12.8 mpg and Premium Gas prices.  The Cadillac gets 23-25 mpg in real world setting and uses regular gas.  The build quality is equal to Lexus.  Finally, Hats off to an American Vehicles"
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,Frank, 04/14/2009,Love It !,4,I traded in a 2007 Tahoe for the Escalade and so far I am very impressed with the performance. You step on the gas and the performance is much better than I was expecting from a hybrid. I am getting 20.7 MPG combined City/Highway driving with mildly conservative driving habits.The fit and finish is what you would expect from Cadillac and is fun to drive.
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,Brak, 09/27/2010,The Big Sipper,4,"It ain't a Prius, but I am getting much better city mileage than in my previous CX-9. I have been pleasantly surprised that I have not given up much in terms of acceleration but gained so much in luxury, comfort and space.  The legend is (not from the dealer but my research) that this is one of the ""bail- out mobiles"" driven from Detroit by the GM execs that were blasted for flying the private jets.  A bunch of them came off lease and I got this for $11k-$13k below retail (according to Edmunds and KBB).  Looks a lot better once I got all the blasted ""Hybrid"" decals off.  We are in love with the Big Sipper."
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,escaladelover, 05/03/2009,WOW!!!!!,5,What a beautiful SUV!!!!! Such a nice and luxurious exterior and interior. The fuel economy for a hybrid is unbelievable!!! My escalade averages around 21.2 MPG for city and around 20 MPG for highway which is magnificent for a vehicle this size!!!! 
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,walt, 02/24/2009,Enjoy the ride,5,Enjoy the car a lot.  We traded in a Volvo XC-90 and enjoy an increase of about 5 mpg and (more important to the wife) an increase of about a 200 miles between fill-ups. The Escalade has performed flawlessly and the tight turning radius makes it easy to park. The magnetic ride control easily makes this the best riding vehicle I have ever owned.    
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,imint213, 11/26/2014,After a year of ownership,3,"Well, I'm not that impressed with Cadillac. For the price you pay, more thought should go into the comfort and convenience. First of all, how does it not have a cabin air filter. Even low model Toyotas have cabin filters. Instead of 22 inch wheels, they should be 20 inch for a smoother ride. Cadillac needs to redesign the way the 3rd row seating folding can accommodate more storage space. I could go on and on.

The Bluetooth system is not very good. It does not pull up contact list, does not allow you to use the car keypad number, and there is difficulty pairing the 3G i Phone from apple"
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,amanda, 04/27/2010,NOT WORTH THE MONEY AND MILEAGE IS TERRI,2,"I bought this car thinking I was going green. Unfortunately, only thing green about this car is the high price tag.  I have always had a MERCEDES and never minded spending the money as it is a quality car. No comparison!!!! Leather is cheap in the Escalade and my dog have made scratches every time they are in there.  Storage is non existent. Not even room for the DVD ear phones.  No spare tire. Had to pay $1,400 extra for a spare tire mounted underneath the car.  This car needs to be totally redesigned and done correctly  Do not waste your money on this one."

cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,Sam, 06/25/2010,Are you seriously stupid?,2,"WHAT THE HELL did I get myself into? I should have bought a Mercedes Benz or Land Rover Rang Rover HSE! The quality management of this car is horrific, the navigation/cd player unit is useless most of the time due to its horrific functionality: every day I choose a new station it needs to scan the stations again and again and again the navigation is SLOW. I'll press buttons and wait up to 10 seconds until anything happens, and when it does, it'll happen all wrong.  I went over a bump, and the plastic under carriage clip broke off and the INTERIOR wood trimming in the rear snapped of since it's a CLIP ON! The DVD unit takes such a long time to start if you've turned off the car so."
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,Michele, 08/14/2010,Huge Mistake,2,"My husband wanted this car and we traded in our Lexus GX for it.  I should have know something when they rushed to take our Lexus.  It looks great on the outside, causing accidents when I drive from people looking so hard.  Cheaply made bumper (bumped while parked by a car slowing coming out park) and broke clips and bumper.  Seat belts are flimsy (my kids as well as myself struggle to buckle in).  We are currently trading it in and it has lost so much value the last year  (over 10 thousand).  Factory Remote start works when it feels like it.  I have to push button several times unless I am right next to it.  Who needs it then.  Don't listen when they tell you that this car can take regular."
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2009,Gus Oliver, 12/20/2018,Better Mileage than my Wife's Escalade,4,"It doesn't get 20MPG but how many cars get the EPA rated mileage?  I am getting 15 around town and 17 on the highway.  My wife has a 2008 Escalade ESV (not a hybrid) that gets about 12 around town and 16 on the highway.  At 2000 miles per month, I figure I will save about $100 at $2.50/gallon.  I do have more things that can go wrong but that is why I bought an extended warranty although it doesn't cover everything.  The tire sensors (did not work which the dealer was suppose to fix and didn't) which the tire shop indicated they go bad after 8-10 years.  The big trim piece in front of the dash is broken, the upholster is messed up on the console lid and the back seat but that has more to do with the last owner than the car itself.  It does have wind noise around the driver's window and a few rattles but overall, I am satisfied.  It is not a new vehicle.  It does still have about half of its life left but cost me about 20% of the cost of a new one.

cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2010,mother8, 08/27/2013,Buyer beware,1,"The electrical system has gone out four times in 6 weeks. This means no power steering, power brakes, gas etc. No power! This makes the vehicle a liability on the road. I am getting very little support from the dealer to resolve this issue. This vehicle needs to be taken off the road before someone gets hurt or even worse killed. Traveling at a high speed on the freeway without power as I experienced was quite frightening to say the least. Every time the system has failed I was traveling in traffic. Not sure if this is a Hybrid, Cadillac or Escalade issue?"
cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2010,Jason, 11/25/2015,Major Issues with Escalade Hybrid,1,"Although the cadillac lives up to it's name in comfort and style the vehicle was in the shop more often than on the road. The car had MAJOR electrical issues which forced me to trade it in on an Audi. The reliability was terrible as we never knew when the next MAJOR issue would arise. After 100,000 miles the hybrid battery system went out completely which was going to cost $3300 to replace. The running boards were automatic and both motors burned out along with several other smaller items. Overall we spent well over $3000 trying to fix the car (of course the dealer did not help at all as they washed their hands clean- not surprising). Needless to say, I most likely will not buy another Cadillac and will definitely not buy from that specific dealer.  Highly disappointed in the overall quality of cadillac.

cadillac,escalade-hybrid,2010,Josh, 05/17/2020,Money pit that dealership can't figure out,1,"STEER CLEAR OF THIS MODEL!! I bought the Escalade Hybrid used for my family hoping to enjoy the large comfort, good sound, and power and pulling, but what I got was a car that has been broken down for the majority of the 2-1/2 years I have owned it. Serious problems started happening with the electrical system, hybrid system, and power steering. The car dash flashes with strange warnings and then shuts off. The power steering went out, and this problem ultimately bricked it. After taking it to the dealership for the power steering, I have replaced the hybrid battery, regular battery, auxillary transmission pump, auxilary transmission module,  electronic control module, and the car still does not run. The current codes say I need the steering position sensor which GM discontinued and no after market versions exist. And now I am getting codes for the hybrid battery again after I just replaced it. I have terrivle sunk costs in this car but the dealership nor GM nor Cadillac will help me. I will never buy another Cadillac. They don't understand their own Frankenstein hybrid they created and now I have a junk vehicle in my driveway with a loan payment due every month.

Bose radio is very good however the CD and cassett player has no tone control. Compared mine with new Cadillacs and found the same thing. Changing the Bass up or down made no difference. Complained to dealer and they said that is just the way the Bose is. Complained to Bose and never got a response. We never listen to music on this junk sound system.

It drives well, and although I had early problems with it, lately it has performed very well and I have had only minor problems with it. I think the style is great, the sound system is excellent, and the comfort is off the charts. It rides very smoothly up to about 65 miles an hour, but I believe that there is a problem with the springs on all of the 2000 models where it becomes noticeably shaky until about 80 mph. The size isn't what I was hoping it to be.  It's very roomy, don't get me wrong, but now that I think about it, it is a little bit big for my needs.

The car is sexy, fast and comfortable, but everything goes wrong on it.

This was a great car to own until the mileage hit 100,000. Then it started to cost me a lot of money. The car had constant oil leak problems which apparently are common with the Northstar engine. Some of the interior components are low in quality for what you expect from a Cadillac e.g. cup holders, garage opener knobs, seat adjustment controls. All broke.  Other than the reliability issues, this was a great car to own. Powerful and smooth drive. Nav system, rear parking sensors, wiper sensors, leather seating are all great.  Some parts are no longer available after 10 years."

The car will run great and I love how I can pick up and move on the road. I don't like that every other week I have this car in the shop and people are ripping me off on parts.

cadillac,seville,2000,Cesar Lasinsky, 11/24/2020,"Nothing special, nothing interesting",3,"I am a European from Poland and I am surprised that Americans have opinions that Cadillac is a luxury car, these cars are full of plastic, which crackles after a year from new, I drove the 2017 Escalade and the cockpit started to fiddle after a year of driving, the automatic transmission is a failure somehow,  slow, each gear change is felt where in Europe city cars 20x cheaper than escalades have better gearboxes and quality finish of some elements.  The suspension is only suitable for driving straight ahead at higher speed and sudden turns, the car has a tendency to tip over onto the roof, a shame for the brakes, I know that the car is heavy, but the car brakes like a tractor in the field"
cadillac,seville,2000,BGB, 04/23/2010,Love the car but Maintainance excessive,4,"Bought car used in July 2006.  73K kilometers, now 165K. LOVE the drive, the incredible Bose sound system, the handling and the acceleration.  I have a bad back and the leather seats are sooo comfortable and great support.  Sight lines are fabulous.  Runs quite and no outside noise.  Little things too.  Pop the trunk and it opens right up, don't have to lift it.  Open the hood and you don't have to put up a bar to keep it open.  Everything is colour coded.  Uses REGULAR gas.  Great gas mileage on the hwy.  Strong car too.  Was rear ended and barely felt it.  The seat seemed to wrap around me.  Bumper had a big dent but the front end of the other car was a mess.  Downside is the maintainance."
cadillac,seville,2000,jbm, 07/26/2002,200 Seville,4,"MY car would stall when it was going 
really slow...coasting, etc.  It was 
repaired under warranty.  Something to 
do with slow torque......  Otherwise it 
has been one of my favorite cars.  My 
first favorite was my 1989 Seville."
cadillac,seville,2000,stlphil, 05/05/2002,Car Fax?,1,"I checked this vehicle on Car Fax. Paid 
the 19.99 fee. Clear title reported, no 
problems reported. This car has 
mechanical problems out the wazoo. Only 
25,000 miles on the car. The ABS 
doesn't work, the steering is sloppy, 
the accelaration is erratic. The 
console wood has been re-painted. This 
car is dangerous to drive. 
Be cautious of a Car Fax check. I don't 
think anyone would buy this car that 
was Cadillac Certified and Car Fax 
certified."
cadillac,seville,2000,Doc Z, 12/07/2005,Think American Again,4,"Love the STS.  I would change the styling of the interior toward a more ergonomicly friendly center console.  Also, the drink holder is less than adequate. I love the performance and the styling, this is my fifth Cadillac, three of which have been the STS model. I will look at the new STS-V when it comes out leter this year. Bring on the German and Japanese luxury cars, so they can go home with their tails between their legs.  American engineeing is kicking butt with the STS-V and is ready to take on any challengers in the luxury sedan venue. I have owned Mercedes, Lincoln, Lexus, and BMW and the only one that comes close is the Lexus."

those cars are nothing compared to the 
Cadillac."
cadillac,seville,2000,ADE 1000, 08/03/2003,Great car,4,"We leased the STS after comparing it 
to the following vehicles: Audi A6 
4.2, BMW 540i, Lincoln LS V-8, and MB 
E430. The STS offered more car for the 
money in our opinion, and prefferred 
its ride quality and exterior styling. 
Our lease is over and our experience 
was a pleasant one. The car was a 
great highway cruiser, it handled 
well, had decent power, and the ride 
is amazingly smooth. Reliability was 
fair, the car needed a few trips to 
the dealer for minor warranty stuff. 
Overall, the car was solid."

cadillac,seville,2000,Fatty87, 01/22/2004,the BEST CAR i have ever owned,5,"I bought this car with 70000 miles on 
it. I have driven it hard for two years 
and it now has 112895 miles. Not a damn 
problem. She is a beauty, she a has a 
great body and boy does she have a 
personality. I previously had a 96 STS 
and was some what let down with its 
somewhat fair build quality. BUT, now I 
am convinced that CADDY has changed And 
I will be buying more RELIABLE cars 
from Caddy and so should you."
cadillac,seville,2000,Happy Ed, 02/28/2004,OK. Who really built this car?,5,"  I purchased this vehicle as 
a ""Sunday"" car. Not a work vehicle or 
drive the kids to school vehicle. My 
first drive on the highyway worried me, 
because it had a slight vibration. I 
returned it for repairs, 4 tires 
corrected the problem(end of the year 
purchase. Sitting for a year without 
driving, flatten the tires somewhat) It 
gets great gas mileage, 3 mpg better 
than my Mitsubishi Sigma V6. This is 
also driving without trying to get gas 
mileage, in the 70 to 80 mph range, and 
when you want to pass, step on the gas 
and pass. Everything works. The car is 
dead quiet on the road, no rattles or 
creeks. Very enjoyable."
cadillac,seville,2000,mike6480, 08/26/2004,2000 STS,4,"This is a fantastic vehicle. Bought 
used but low miles and in perfect 
condition. Power, Styling, Comfort, and 
features are world class and exceeded 
my expectations. Seems to be holding 
value very well relative to miles ( key 
is to keep miles on low average side ). 
Was disappointed with life of OEM 
Goodyear Eagles, just put new set of 
Bridgestone Turanzas' on, can already 
tell difference in handling. If you can 
find a STS 2-3 years old with less than 
30k mileage, BUY IT ! great car at half 
price of new."
cadillac,seville,2000,John Hickam, 01/20/2005,Seville STS Rating,4,"The 2000 Cadillac Seville STS has a lithe, supple ride and handles very well.  It gets up to 25 mpg.  At 80,000 miles, the  only non-scheduled maintenance that I have performed was the installation of a new abs system and a fuel pressure regulator."
cadillac,seville,2000,Warning, 03/03/2007,Hmph,2,"if you buy one of these out of warranty you're gonna wanna put about $4,000 in a safe for that rainy day when your head gaskets or cylinder heads fail you. You're also going to want to set aside $150 semiannually for replacement of the front door Bose subwoofers.  And you're going to want to put aside $70 weekly for gas because the car breathes it in.  You're going to wonder why your engine shuts off at a stoplight the day after a rainy day.  You're going to want to put your hazards on so the hasty driver behind you won't beep their horn when the light turns green after yours shuts off. You're going to want to change that dexcool annually, forget what the manual says.  Three years later you're going to wonder why you bought it."
cadillac,seville,2000,TAT, 05/11/2003,Like it,4,"Bought the car new. Love the V8, it  
has impresive passing power. I drive 
across the country each spring and am 
comfortable even on 10 hr. runs. 
Running at 80 MPH I get 25 MPG, great 
for a large car."
cadillac,seville,2000,2000caddyman, 06/30/2003,2000 Seville STS,5,"After being a very satisfied owner of a 
Cartier Lincoln Town Car and had 
reservations about repalcing my Town 
Car with a Seville.  MY Seville exceeds 
my Town Car in every area except the 
rear seat.  I test drove a Lexus and a 
Jaguar before I purchased my seville 
and I was very favorably impressed wih 
my seville. The interior appointments 
areecxeptional and rival any other 
luxury car.  If it were called a Lexus, 
BMW,or Mercedes, the pinheads who write 
for automobile magazines would rate it 
higher.  There is an obvious bias 
against American Cars by the automotive 
press. The Seville STS is a very 
underrated car."

this new one stalls while driving down 
the street. They have replaced the 
engine crank sensors. Then they say 
when I bring it back the second time 
for the same problem they put a 
diagnostic package on it and could not 
get the problem to duplicate. How can I 
search for others for possible solution 
or retribution? I am glad Wisconsin has 
a ""lemon law"" and will not be hesitant 
to invoke it.  Unless they reair it 
permanently 
or replace it now on the third try for 
the same problem it will be the last 
Cadillac I purchase."
cadillac,seville,2001,nathaniel, 04/27/2013,15 Years Old and Still a Beauty,5,"I purchased my 2001 STS in about May of 2004 as it came off of a 3-year lease. It had about 32K miles and now it only has about 88K (as of 10/16). I purchased it at Caddy dealer. A new Caddy comes with a 3-year 50K warranty... However.... a Certified Used Cadillac has/had a 6 year/100K mile one, which makes a used one with the Certified Warranty a bonus for the used car purchaser. Also, they cover not only power train, but practically everything (i.e. basically bumper to bumper), including a free loaner car. Couple of months after purchase it developed an oil leak. No ""oil pan"" on transverse, i.e. had to remove engine, take apart in middle and put in a new gasket. Glad it was under warranty. 
--- 
Updated 10/16... As I updated above it now has about 87,000 miles and looks fairly much like new (garaged, plus I keep it polished and clean...) When I tell people it's a 2001 and I've had it since 2004 they can't believe it.  Still runs great, geat power, great stopping ability, and great handling for a car of its size. Also, nice interior leather with good fit and finish.

A nice riding car that holds its value."
cadillac,seville,2001,Mike, 11/21/2008,Fast Luxury Sedan,5,"We bought the car used with 25K miles. This car is a joy to drive, my wife rarely lets me drive it because I drive it like a sports sedan. The 300hp DOHC 32 valve engine is quiet, but revs quickly & effortlessly to 6500 rpm when needed.  Need to pass someone....point it straight, hit the accelerator & you are approaching warp speed vey rapidly (EX: passing 50mph- 85mph in under 6 seconds) in addition to a luxury ride, outstanding heated seats with memory & awesome Bose 6+1 cd changer.  For mid 50 year old it is a true luxury hotrod. In town we get 20+ mpg & 25-28 mpg on hiway (as long I don't start driving like speed racer). Great car, somewhat expensive to repair/maintain."

Seville SLS it has been in the shop way too many times.
The instrument panel computer failed 3 times, 
both front seat heaters failed, the 
left rear door just would not open, the  
engine stopped (no steering - scared my 
wife who was driving) ad nauseum.  I have

Year later died at Doctor's office. Had it towed to dealer again. $300 for new ""special Caddy"" battery cause terminal broke. Battery is under back seat that no one uses. How could this happen? Got no answer. Year later had to jump start car, then dash lights went out. Traded it in back to dealer I bought it from!"

It's a thrill to drive and more comfortable than you would believe.  As with any high end vehicle, repairs and parts are costly, though this vehicle has proven to be so reliable that the need for such is few and far between."
cadillac,seville,2001,Firestorm 500, 02/05/2009,Darth Vader's Cadillac,4,"Bought used black on black STS with 78K miles for my wife. Now it has 118K miles. Generally reliable. Have replaced battery, crank position sensors, engine air tube, engine cooling fan and a few other things. Others are right, car is expensive to have worked on, I only let Cadillac dealer do it. Rides nice, is quiet. Handles good. Bose 4.0 stereo very good. Car still looks good, many favorible comments. Good A/C. Roomy. Trunk is adequate. 300 HP Northstar will fly, but uses oil about 1 qt. every 700 miles or so.  About 19 mpg city, 24 highway, regular fuel. Very good traction on wet roads or snow. Stabilitrak helps a lot. Has better build quality than my 97 Eldorado or 97 Catera.  "
cadillac,seville,2001,PMP, 07/18/2009,Dont sleep on this one !,4,"Bought used with 120k from a guy who didnt really keep up on the maintenance but I got her back to 100% in no time. Replaced the crank sensors (very common) I suggest you replace them before they go @ around 100k miles. Also replaced the cat (common as well) $300 so again not a big deal on a $53k car. The car uses about 2qts of oil every 3k miles which is common on northstars. Again not a big deal, just keep up on your oil changes. Ive owned alot of high end cars (audi,mercedes,jaguar,bmw) and must say this caddy is right up there with them ! I get compliments everywhere I go and its 8 yrs old ! Navigation is also easier to use than most factory units. Stop thinking go buy one ! "

Cadillac, I thought I was receiving, 
the best American Made Car I could 
get.  Boy, are we in trouble.  After  
14 months, I have a service repair 
history about 10 feet long.  I have had 
my car in 15-20 times, all for problems 
I would not have expected in a $54K 
car.  For example, broken 
plastic ""wood"" pieces, rattles, 
squeaks, computer 
replacement/reprogramming, power 
steering, motor mount, transmission, 
and brakes!!  For a car that is 
advertised as a ""race car"", I haven't 
had a set of pads or rotors that have 
lasted longer than 5000 miles!!  I've 
put at least 10000 miles on rental 
DeVilles since I bought this *New* STS!"
cadillac,seville,2001,k5861, 12/01/2002,Crank Sensors,4,"I agree with Vosser. This is my sixth 
Cadillac, the first Seville.  At 9,000 
miles, it needed a new power steering 
pump which seemed to take the dealer 
forever to obtain.  At 12000 miles, it 
stalled out in the middle of a busy 
city street where the speed limit was 
45 mph. The diagnosis via On Star was 
defective crank sensors.  For the 
nearly $46K this vehicle cost, such 
problems are simply not acceptable."
cadillac,seville,2001,Icefish4, 09/08/2003,Seville SLS,4,"This is an awesome car with a few 
major exceptions. First and foremost, 
the suspension is so sensitve, you 
can't keep the tires balanced. 
Michelins are essential, as the 
factory Goodyears are junk and have 
no business on this car. Also, too 
many electronic ""doodads"" that fail. 
Mine has been in the shop several 
times for failed sensors. A great car

This car is in mint condition with lots of comfort and convenience features. Performance takes second place to luxury, but not by a lot. Once rolling its a quick car and body lean is kept to a minimum. Its too big to be a sports car but if you want a sporty luxury car, this is a good one."

cadillac,seville,2001,PEARL, 09/17/2010,A great ride,5,"I bought this car through a dealership.  It had been a lease car.  My brother got it for me wholesale.  The heater wasn't functioning (December - brrr).  I learned only a year ago that it had been in a bad accident and the axle is bent.  Also, I knew that there was an oil leak, so I add a quart every other tank of gas.  Overall, of the five I've owned (one Allante), it's been the best one yet.  I've gotten 28 mpg on the freeway.  It's diamond white, so it still cleans up perfectly.  It shines like a diamond when I'm looking for it in a parking lot.  All those other 'bubble' cars that all look alike can't hold a candle to it.  It had 58,000 when I bought it; I have 155,000 now."

cadillac,seville,2001,Christine Hunt, 04/06/2005,Incredible Car,4,"I bought this car about 9 months ago.  I look for reasons to drive it.  It truly is a driving dream in every sense.  I felt especially safe during the Chicago winter season due to the suspension, traction control and stability control.  It truly is an amazing car to handle.  The interior is extremely luxurious, and very well put together.  The heated seats just add to the driving pleasure.  I will definitely buy another certified Cadillac."
cadillac,seville,2001,DM, 09/07/2005,Cadillac convert,4,"As a long time import owner, domestics were never high on my list.  I've owned several Nissan / Infiniti vehicles.  Needed a larger vehicle for the family and to travel in.  STS works perfectly everyone has room and the Caddy more than gets up.  Pretty much every creature comfort available and rides quiet.   By the way, I'm way under 40 so the looks from the older Caddy owners are just great. "
cadillac,seville,2001,On my 3rd Northstar., 08/12/2006,It's a Cadillac,4,"Like the age old ad says it's the ""penalty of leadership."" All of these Sevilles are based on the 1998 design. Compared to all other makes no one was this progressive. Sure the car is a bit heavy, expensive to own, and expensive to repair, but all in all it's a superlative motor car. Overall I've had minimal problems with this car for the amount of technology involved. The seat heaters were replaced under warranty, it had a vibration at 65 mph fixed under warranty, and the valve position sensor had to be replaced. Otherwise this is a start it up and go car. Not to mention it can pass anything else on the road quite effortlessly. Bottom line, if you want to drive GM's top of the line expect some minor problems. Overall it is luxury at its best!"
cadillac,seville,2001,Mo, 10/09/2006,Superb,4,"This car's exterior's exterior combines the best of European and Japanese design, with the interior luxury and comfort of an American car.  It definitely is worth a look if you are interested in a car to enjoy.  I look for reasons to drive it."
cadillac,seville,2001,Judith, 09/07/2007,Good car,4,"This car has a classic look and a great ride. Plenty of room for passengers, and comfortable seats too. My STS is great on slippery roads and in snow. There is virtually no air noise. I now have over 95,000 miles on my car, and I am having a hard time thinking about getting rid of it. It's getting older and the value is going down, but I still love it."
cadillac,seville,2001,Hudson Jeff, 04/28/2003,2001 Cadillac Seville STS Review,2,"Acceleration seems slow and the car 
feels too heavy.  The front wheel drive 
with 300 horsepower causes the traction 
control to come on constantly in slick 
conditions.  I replaced the factory 
Goodyears with Michelins and it 
improved.  Lots of little problems need 
fixing, thank goodness its under 
warranty.  The interior is nice and 
comfortable and the sound system is 
good.  Lots of standard features.  
Definitely not a drivers car.  Huge 
first year depreciation hit.  Consider 
a purchase it performance is secondary 
to comfort.  Even smarter is buying one 
a year or two old and avoid the 
depreciation hit."

charge."
cadillac,seville,2001,Ronnie Coles, 01/15/2003,Owners review with auto experience.,4,"I like mine,I give it 2 big thumbs up. 
However, I believe that the electric 
gadgets is to much to go wrong. It's 
the closest American made car to the C-
5 Vette, in a ""4dr"" you can get. From 
the deep floor pans for leg room to 
the 300hp Northstar it's 1st class 
sport luxury.Brand new mine ran 15.03 
@ 96 MPH in the 1/4 mile.I have raced 
and BEAT many Mustang GTs on the 
street from a roll-on. With it's 
massive weight it's not a trill outta 
the hole but once you get it moving, 
HANG-ON!Now that mine is broke-in i'm 
certain it would run 14.80s or better."
cadillac,seville,2002,pezlow, 12/10/2008,Chaos Theory,4,I have owned my 2002 STS for three years and love it...sort of. I'll be honest the engine and tranny work great together. Throughout my time owning it I have not had to have the engine or transmission serviced. The interior looks great (it won interior of the year in 1998) especially with the newer nav unit but it does suffer from the GM rattles and cheap plastics. The real problem with this car is it's suspension. Tie rods and intermediate shafts seem to be a recurring problem. Having 300HP going to the front wheels puts a lot of strain on those weak legs. I love my car and thank goodness for warranties.      
cadillac,seville,2002,Jack Clark, 07/07/2002,Twenty-seventh Cadillac,5,"I have had this Seville SLS for about 45 days.  It is about the 27th Cadillac 
that I have owned.  This is the best.  The last one I had was a 2000 STS and 
I like this better because it rides better, is more quite, and gets better gas 
mileage. (30.5 on the hiway) It handles great and is very well put together.   
It has plenty of power.  300 ft lbs of tourque and comes in at lower rpm than 
on the STS.  I drove a new Lexus and it felt like a boat compared to the 
Seville.  For the money you can't beat it.  My friend has a Mercedes and is 
always having trouble and it costs so much to have anything done to it.  Over 
$200.00 just for an oil change."
cadillac,seville,2002,susan, 12/08/2005,Overall Comments After One Year of Ownership,3,"My 2002 Cadillac Seville STS  was exceptional when acquired however, electronics and mechanicals became inoperable, needing complete replacemen.  I had to make major mechanical repairs to the engine, steering shaft, stereo, too many to list.  It is a good thing they have a long term warranty on their ""quality"" used vehicles. I am disappointed with the overall experience. The front pilars are wicked blind spots also."
cadillac,seville,2002,hodrod guy, 08/10/2006,This is a True Beast,4,"I just got this puppy in May of this year...so far so good.  It's funny how I ended up in this car being that I was looking at a '91 Corvette and a 2003 Mustang GT.  Not to mention I was getting out of a 1999 Trans Am...needless to say I'm into fast, agressive cars, but my main goal this time around was to get the most bang for my buck and the Cadillac SLS beat them out.  It's really fast and solid as a rock.  I love the way the back end of the car looks, but the front end is the only thing I'd change.  It is just a little farty.  I tend to forget that when I get behind the wheel and hit high speeds in no time while feeling like I'm sitting on the couch in my living room.  I recommend this car for anyone who grew up as a gear head.  I'm 25 years old."
cadillac,seville,2002,Onyx, 02/18/2009,"Never Liked Cadillacs, Until Now",4,"This is my first Cadillac. I fell in love with the interior right away.  All leather and wood, soft seats, pretty dash display. It took a few days before I realized what a beautiful car is is on the exterior also. It is sleek and sporty in a way.  I bought this car used and it has lots of little problems. The steering wheel shakes, the struts are bad, the tire pressure sensors are confused, the alignment is bad.  After reading other reviews, I realize that's normal for this car, but I'll try to fix it anyway. I'm in love with my Cadillac.  It seems to know the road better than I do and it goes right where I tell it to go. The sound system rocks. Did I mention  I'm in love with a Caddy?"
cadillac,seville,2002,dissapointed, 06/17/2010,Dissapointed,3,I am a long time Cadillac lover and although this is a pretty nice car I am very glad I bought it used instead of a 40 to 50 grand sticker new the 300 horse does not feel like 300 horse well that's at the crank anyway. Reliability is ok but I wouldn't take a long road trip without worrying of maxing out a credit card in repairs on the way parts are expensive not owner friendly maintenance . I should have stuck to the 94 mark vii 170k ran like a champ and not hard to work on and way more power. I have lost faith in gm. I have been turned to Ford. For performance and reliability very disappointed
cadillac,seville,2002,Bill Hooven, 04/22/2002,Genuine Road Car,4,"This car is safe, reliable and, above 
all, just plain fun to drive.  Can't 
believe road-handling .. . point it and 
it goes there.  Cornering is secure and 
confidence-building.  Mileage 
excellent, and on regular unleaded! 
Seats especially comfortable - all day 
drives no problem. This one is for the 
person who loves quality and road 
manners."
cadillac,seville,2002,mdpelc, 08/15/2003,Best of both Worlds,4,"This is my second STS. Cadillac has a

on a car."
cadillac,seville,2002,surfone, 02/25/2009,Piece of junk,3,"I always try to buy American. I bought this 2002 Seville STS with 36,000 miles on it. After 3 months of ownership and $1100 worth of repairs, I am sorry I ever bought it. The only good things are the mileage and the stereo. Everything else is garbage. Don't buy one unless it comes with a warranty."

Love the power, and comfort.  Mileage for this much power and size of car is amazing.  Front wheel drive and Stabilitrak makes driving in snow a joy.  Interiors and engines in these cars seem to last forever!  At speed and Ive had mine will over 100 MPH on several occasion these cars a stable and smooth.  Would recommend one to anyone."
cadillac,seville,2002,inkjax, 09/11/2009,cadillac's are amazing !,5,The 02 sls is just as Nice as my 96 etc. Not every car is perfect. Some do have issues. For the most part caddys are amazing cars with a huge history (except for v8-6/4 and ht4100) both huge piles of crap! The s series cars are well built and usually very very reliable cars. Fun to drive and easy to take care of. Vegas and nearly back on a tank with all the performance of a sports car! How do you beat that? (230 miles one way) that was nearly 28 mpg in full size luxury sedan. I have owned 75 caddys in my life and would recommend them to anyone who wanted an upscale reliable car. Amazing ! Thank you Cadillac!   
cadillac,seville,2002,Chris Klein, 01/15/2005,First time four door...,4,"My 2002 Seville is my fourth Cadillac. My preference in style has always been the Eldorado though. I had many problems with my 1995 Cadillac ETC, and was looking at a head gasket.  With $6,000 in repairs in two years, I was done. My 2002 Certified Pre-Owned Seville SLS is a nice change of pace. It handles the crappy local streets and pot holes much better than my ETC did. For a heavier car, it drives like a much smaller car; i.e. the 1997 Nissan Maxima SE that I used to own. It have been experiencing some light shaking in the steering in wheel at 65+ MPH. The dealer ""replaced tie rod"", but I still notice the shake. It's not bad, but I am not convinced this is ""the way it sohuld ride."" I paid nearly $22,000 for this car with less than 35,000 miles. It was in near new condition and certified. I miss having a sunroof."
cadillac,seville,2002,TXalias, 03/19/2002,SLS is a nice car,4,"Comfortable, reliable, powerful. You get a lot for the money. Turn radius leaves a lot to be desired and some quality issues are also dissapointing."
cadillac,seville,2002,Northstar Engine , 11/28/2009,Caddy Seville 2002 SLS with On-star,4,"     I bought this Caddy in March of 2005, it is my sixth Caddy. Two have been bummers but not this one. I have had no trouble with this car. I love to drive it and it handles very well. It has the Northstar engine and i get excellant milage. On a trip around 26 around town about 20. I also own a 1991 Seville that i love to drive. I have nothing but good things to say about this car."
cadillac,seville,2002,Greg, 08/30/2005,Not very welll built,2,I wouldn't buy another Cadillac. My 2002 Seville has been in the shop for 3 major fixes and now that it is no longer under warranty I worry all of the time about the next system failure. Each failure resulted in over a week at the shop and would have cost several thousand dolalrs if not for the warranty. 
cadillac,seville,2002,Black on Black, 04/01/2009,8 out of 10,4,"This car has great looks,smooth decent power,and lots of unnecessary goodies like steering wheel controls,rain sensing wipers,memory seats and radio presets,back up sensors,etc. The handling is pretty good for a 4,000 pound car although you can definitely tell its 4,000 pounds when you push it in corners. Its too bad that you cant completely disengage the stability control which slows you down in the turns. I like driving fast and the Northstar responds as happily as 300 hp can although I do wish they threw in about 30 to 40 more hp and torque. I might get Corsa exhaust but still deciding if I want my Caddy to sound like a Z/28. Awesome used car value. Bought 3/09 for $9,244 53k No snrf,nav"
cadillac,seville,2002,David Hamilton, 06/28/2002,2002 STS REVIEW,4,"This is my second Seville in 4 years.  
The build quality and lack of problems 
is greatly improved with my 2002 STS."
cadillac,seville,2002,lemko, 09/11/2003,2002 Cadillac Seville STS,4,"This is my third new Cadillac. I bought 
it to replace my 1994 Cadillac DeVille 
base model. What else can I say but 
that the Seville STS is easily the most 
attractive luxury sedan on the marker - 
foreign or domestic. The performance of 
the 4.6 litre Northstar V-8 is 
legendary. The Delco-Bose stereo system 
alone is worth the price of admission 
as it sounds even better than my home 
system. The car feature som many nice 
amenities there's not enough bandwidth 
to list them. I had considered a Lexus 
LS430, but the Seville offers better 
styling, performance, and value."
cadillac,seville,2002,Joe Stevens, 11/03/2003,This is my second Cadillac,4,"I traded in a 1997 SLS that I loved 
because it started to burn a quart of 
oil every 1,000 miles.  I love the 
2002 STS in every way except a 
couple.  I have had extreme problems 
balancing the tires, and still have a 
slight vibration at certain speeds.  I 
also wish, (minor issue) that the sun 
roof was a one touch close as well as 
the one touch open, and lastly, the 
satellite radio antenna on the roof 
should be painted, not a flat finish 
plastic.  It detracts from the car.  
Other makes paint their antenna cover 
to match the car finish.  "
cadillac,seville,2002,EALEXB, 05/02/2003,This STS is GREAT! Recommend highly.,5,"I had a 1997 STS before this one and it 
was impressive. This 2002 STS outdoes 
it with greater features and more gas 
mileage (I'm averaging 32-33 on 
Highway)!!
The car handles great and does NOT ride 
like a luxury car, more like a Corvette 
(had a 2000 Vette, and the Caddy seems 
to ride very similar, except the weight 
of the car). All in all a great car for 
the price!
ENJOY!"
cadillac,seville,2002,Buy American, 03/23/2008,Cadillac for luxury and performance,5,"This SLS is my 3rd Cadillac, and by far the best car I've owned. Ride comfort on long trips is unsurpassed, as is fuel economy for a car this size. The Northstar engine is really amazing in that it has incredible power, yet gets 30 mpg on the highway. Around town it is nimble while soaking up rough pavement in stride. Cadillac has a proven winner with this generation Seville with reliability of a Swiss watch. Or should I call it the Rolex of cars."
cadillac,seville,2002,bas, 12/29/2005,Worst Purchase I have Ever Made,2,"I have had nothing but problems from the moment I drove my Cadillac Seville STS off the lot.  My repair folder is over 3"" thick - including continual vibration in steering at various speeds and reverbration in entire car and tie rods that were replaced numerous times.  There is service bulletin out there - but dealers won't disclose this.  I would NEVER recommend the Seville to anyone."
cadillac,seville,2002,Dave, 03/11/2008,Great Cadillac stop holds up to the best,5,I bought this car 8 months ago not knowing much about the Cadillac family very much. I was obviously worried about that curse used Cadillacs seem to carry with them with a high rate of unreliability but iwas wrong. I kept good tabs on this baby and she has never failed me with a breakdown or faulty light not once. The only problem I had was the water pump froze and ended up getting a small crack but I still believe that was due to the consecutive 5 degree days (and sub zero) nights up in the northshore. I love the cockpit and have had no complaints of leg room. Very powerful when it needs and refined.

cadillac,seville,2002,William E. Rogers, 06/14/2002,Seville SLS,5,"This car replaces my 1999 Eldorado ETC 
only because I needed a 4 door sedan.I 
drove a Jaguar S type which was 
comparably priced.  Not only did the 
SLS perform better but I was able to 
negotiate a much better price by 
thousands.  I chose the SLS over the 
STS because of the lower rear end ratio 
which is yielding excellent fuel 
mileage on regular gas. This along with 
the luxury package make for a great 
driving auto."

Big deal. This car always starts, rides great and the BOSE is much more than you will ever need. I reccomend Cadillac to any and everyone. 27MPG also. "
cadillac,seville,2003,Steven Jerome, 08/05/2006,'03 STS,4,"This is my third STS and by far the best. I also had a '96 and a '98. This car's beautiful lines and aggressive wheels and tires make a great first impression. Mine has every option except navigation. It is very smooth, luxurious, and classy. It's much better than the Mercedes E430 that I traded in in every aspect. I am extremely satisfid with this car."
cadillac,seville,2003,Jason, 12/22/2009,32 year old get a Cadillac,4,"My first luxury car, and I think i picked a winner.  At first I must say the car had some build issues, speakers, driver side heated seat, driving sensors, lets just say I got to know what a Cadillac dealership shop looked like.  But I must say the staff where always helpful, friendly, and very knowledgeable. Once I got all the bugs worked out the car has been great. Taking this car on a road trip is a dream, the performance/comfort ratio truly lives up to the Cadillac name."

features and has that unique style as the price has drop and you can afford to have one. The North star motor can be a smooth surprise, but like with any vehicle you buy there is always some strength and weakness of any car, The car itself is a driving computer and if your not aware of this the car can be your worse nightmare in repair with sensors and the electronic hardware that runs the car, but aside of that the car is a marvel as the technology in the car has laid some idea's for the future Cadillac's,
Its a true Cadillac and i just love mines with 96,000 miles and i am a mechanic

wear out so the engine pours out its 
oil all over my garage floor, 
supposedly common, a $4000 repair. 
Then there is the key getting stuck in 
the ignition, $200 repair. So far this 
car including all the repairs and the 
normal maintenace puts it in the range 
as a mercedes E class. Think twice

Constantly at the dealer for repairs. Had the engine resealed twice. It had 56k miles when I traded it. I traded it for a 2003 with 4k miles. It now has 30k miles and we have had the engine completely resealed, constantly fighting leaks, parts being replaced are lasting less than a year, the air/heater broke down, the seat heaters had to be repaired and the radio and cd changer doesn't work right. I am now looking to trade it in for something else. "
cadillac,seville,2003,nh resident, 07/12/2008,Traded,3,"I just traded the car after two years. It had the most beautiful interior of any vehicle I've ever owned, but constantly had things going wrong after the warranty ran out.  The water pump went at 51K, the seat warmer at 53K, the seat control at 57K and a sensor in the transmission at 66k that would cost $2K to replace (don't think anything was actually wrong with transmission).  This last one was the final straw, and I sold it.  For two people though, it was a wonderful road cruiser."

We will never get rid of it. Its got 34,000 miles on it and still has factory warranty. We had a new 2006 Mercedes R350, their new crossover vehicle. It was junk. They had to buy it back because they couldnt fix it. We also just bought one of the last new '06 Yukons. We had an '04 but sold it. This one also has nav, rear DVD, sunroof, Denali, and OnStar. We will stick with GM for life. Thanks for making such great cars."

I love the exterior styling, especially when compared to the new STS, which is bland and not distinctive. Its iInterior ergonomics are excellent and its design is great.  The Seville SLS is a very comfortable car and a plesaure on a long trips.  Also, its size is perfect, not too big and not too small. This is Cadillac's best car ever.

When it came time to replace it, I found that this last year model was selling at a bargain basement (think low level Hyundai Elantra) price. I am going on two years with it and the only problem I have had was a wind leak in the windshield which the Cadillac dealer fixed under factory warranty. It gets 26-28 MPG on the highway and about 20 around town. I use Pennzoil Synthetic oil and only change it when the onboard computer says to...around every 10,000 miles. I do not have to add oil between changes. It's not as quiet and cushy as my wife;s 2006 DTS, but neither is anything else I've ever driven."

It had an air leak in the windshield due to an improper replacement, but after replacement the car is very quiet. The Michelin Symetry tires provide a good ride. This was a lease return car, so we had a few minor fixes to do, but for the price, it is the best luxury car we have owned. It has a few scrapes on the lower front bumper as it sits pretty low to the ground. It is fun around town as well on the road. The wheel base is a bit longer than our Buick.

I told her I wanted to get her a different car and showed her a 2004 SRX. Well it was love at first sight, nice car all loaded up, we bought it. Well it does not, always, like to start when it is warm. She has been stranded several times and needed rescued. When it does this it will not turn over, will not shut down the electrical system and holds on to the key. I took it to my brother, a service director at Mercedes, and he sent me to a GM guy. The GM guy worried about it for several days and found some advice on the internet, he removed the 7.5amp fuse for the security system......Several more trips to a GM shop and way more spent ($1006.56 the last time) I traded it for a 2011 Cadillac SRX and it is perfect in every way.
I met the person that bought this car from the Cadillac dealer that I traded with. She has not had any problems except that something caused her and the car to drive it into a building causing about $5000.   in damages. The 2011 SRX that I traded for has been spot ever since it's purchase.

The sunroof is amazing, the shape of the car and body style is beautiful... but that's where it ended for me! I have only owned this car for 6 months, but it has been in the shop over 10 times for various expensive repairs... new cat converters, new air ride suspension, 2 new power steering columns, various wiring issues, new spark plugs and coils... it has cost  us thousands in repairs, not to mention the hassle of dropping it off at the shop approx every 2-3 weeks! This is definitely not the quiality a cadillac should be!"
cadillac,srx,2004,Leonard, 01/26/2010,Outstanding All-Around Family Vehicle,4,"I was a little concerned about buying a used SRX, having read about many owners' negative experiences. However, after driving this car once I knew it would be ours. This is a spacious and comfortable SUV-wagon-crossover- whatever but it drives like a sport sedan! I'm a big guy that is used to driving a new full-sized Chevy pickup, but the SRX fits me like a glove. After putting a few thousand miles on the car and a couple long rides hauling both people and cargo, I have to admit there isn't much more I could ask for. The V6 is surprisingly powerful, quick-revving, and can deliver decent MPG if you behave yourself. For a used AWD luxury vehicle, this was an amazing value."
cadillac,srx,2004,William, 07/12/2017,Could have been a great car,4,"I love the looks and handling of my SRX. It's 13 years old now and holding up well with the exception of rust on the drivers side wheel well. I've noticed this on several others and the body shop believes it is caused by a poor factory seal between the inner and outer surface. The car is labeled a sports wagon and truly lives up to that name. The front seats are firm which I prefer but combined with the stiff suspension they can quickly become uncomfortable on roads that are anything other than flat and smooth. The dash has a nice layout compared to many newer vehicles with the exception of the heater controls which are located low in the center close to the console. They are loaded with many small buttons and digital readout. Seems easy enough to use but a simple adjustment like switching on the defroster or turning up the fan may require looking at the controls instead of the highway and I've discovered it can be dangerous taking eyes off the road with it's quick and responsive steering. The storage is great and its handled everything I've thrown at it over the years, which is a lot. The major drawback is the drivetrain. The 3.6 v6 motor has all the power I could ever ask for but I'm afraid to use it because these motors suffer from timing chain issues and there are three of them. Second to that is it's oil consumption. The motor requires 6 qts Mobil One and has always been thirsty for more which Cadillac considered normal. Thirsty btw has been anywhere from one qt per 800-1500 miles. The second major drivetrain problem is the transfer case chain. The supplier provided weak chains the first couple years of production and they are prone to stretching and slipping. At least the replacements are properly tempered. Repairs like spark plug, coil and injector replacement require the upper intake plenum be removed which adds to the cost of repairs. I was quoted $310.00 for spark plugs after the warranty was up so I learned to do it myself. Lastly, the car requires two different tire sizes which limits choices and rotating. The oem Goodyear's on mine ran close to $1000.00 mounted.  I love this car, it's served me well, still looks and drives like new but I would never buy another.
 Update: 138000 miles 16 years old. Just installed the third set of tires. Running the rear size on all 4 works out well for rotations. Original timming chain and transfer chain still working well. Rust on left rear wheel well is getting worse and repair cost almost as much as the car is worth. Replaced all brakes and wheel bearings and one tire rod since last report. On last report I stated I would never buy another but three more years have passed and I can think of no other car I rather have. The SRX does everything I need a vehicle to do.

There are numerous electrical problems on the car- doors wont stay shut while driving, third row of seats wont go down, battery keeps dying unexpected and I've replaced it. There was battery drainage in two spots- interior lights blew out, constant engine leaks from trans fluid and power steering. In the past two months, it has been in the shop more than I have driven it. The most unreliable car. I will never purchase another Cadillac product. From what I have read, many other people have experienced the same type of problems with this year/make car. Dealing with Cadillac is awful too."

I found the perfect comprimise. V-8 Northstar power and all the Cadillac comforts. Sunroof is about as close as a convertable as you can get. The rear DVD is great for my son on those long trips and the heated seats are heaven.
Paid just under 14k with 60k miles. This is probably the one that sat on the showroom floor in 2004. Dont get me wrong its not perfect but It fits every need I have as well as the wants. MPGs are around 18 or so but I do drive with a heavy foot since the V-8 makes me smile. Not for everyone but a great car if it fits your needs."
cadillac,srx,2004,candace3, 10/19/2011,Adjustable pedals,4,"I love the car, it's perfect for my needs.
I have had some issues with the wheel pulling to the left, which i asume is the alignment or suspension also at 64,000 and i had to have an engine sensor replaced. Which I have heard to be common with this model.
I think the sensor has something to do with the Pedal placement. I was using the pedals extended a bit, because i'm on the short side.
I was having some delay
with the gas
pedal.
very strange. It was fine when i put the pedal's back to the farthest position.
but that is a feature that I do not get to use now.

Over all I have not had too many issues.

The seats are amazingly comfortable, and the features are impressive. I don't have the sunrooof, but almost every other feature, and it's been a great car for me.

Bought it right after the test drive.  Just love driving it.  I love the versatility of the 3rd row, the sunroof is amazing.  Second row is slightly higher (theater seating) which pax really like.  Great sound system.  The only negative is the paint on the roof rack is peeling.  I also had a leak in the jack storage compartment which the Lexus dealership paid to have fixed.  I would never buy a brand new SRX because of the cost, but this one was 3 years old and had depreciated to $22k. Looks brand new!"

cadillac,srx,2004,guy41, 10/01/2012,More Than a AWD Station Wagon,4,I purchased the 2004 SRX to replace a Buick Riviera and a Chevrolet AWD Astro van. It was difficult finding a vehicle with the sporty ride and handling of the Buick that could also perform some of the daily tasks of the Astro. Suprisingly the SRX does it all with style and grace. I like this model more than the new ones for its sporty station wagon style. Even after 102k miles it makes me smile when I'm behind the wheel and I would buy another.
cadillac,srx,2004,Skylar10, 12/29/2008,Last Cadillac for me.,3,Have not been pleased with this Cadillac. I had never owned a Cadillac and I can truthfully this will be the last one. The transmission is extremely rough shifting at lower speeds - normal says the dealer. When it is cold -has real trouble shifting from reverse into drive -dealer can never duplicate this problem when I take it in. It uses a QT of oil every 1000 miles - no leaks and this is normal per the dealer . The check engine light goes on and off but the dealer can't find out why. Panaramic sunroof makes lots of noise - dealer can't seem to fix that problem either. Throttle body and fuel pump both had to be replaced at 50k.

Ride & handling surprisingly good. Dead Quiet at 70MPH Electronic controls in ice / snow best of the luxury cars.  Hard to make it do something bad when teaching kids to drive on ice.

Both vehicles were upscale for their class and had many great features. I looked for a quality used vehicle as I wanted to get away from premium fuel. I traded in my used '96 Seville which finally had too many miles for the SRX which runs on regular. Would have been a smart fuel move except for the poor mileage I am getting and rising fuel prices. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with this vehicle's handling and ride. I purchased used as I am getting ready to retire and don't want big payments, but I miss the comfort of the Eldo (wish they still made them) and don't want a new vehicle with cheap seating.      "

So here is where the fun begins (not really).  1st week, both rear windows stopped working, rear seats ratted, engine light came on, outside mirrors stopped working and engine was making weird noise.  Luckily it was all covered under warranty.  In the end, 11 parts were replaced INCLUDING 2 timing chains.  Remember this car had only 52k miles on it and was certified pre owned.  In the end, seats still rattle, and outside mirrors still dont quite work right.  COME ON GM, make a car like the Japanese."

Even had NHSTA recalls but they said it doesn't apply to my vin.   This is the worst car I have ever owned except my 1965 Plymouth Barracuda 40 years ago.  do not trust Moore Cad or cad corp.
cadillac,srx,2004,romojondro, 06/03/2015,WORST CAR EVER BUILT,1,"I have never owned a car with more problems than this. At 80k miles with a clean title this car started to fall apart. It leaked water in the passenger side, would turn off on the free way, had abs issues, needed a new starter, blown shocks, two bad headlights, water pump fell out of the car, veered off in directions it felt like at high speed, had electrical problems galore, cd player malfunctioned constantly. Dashboard cracked, defective airbags and over all a commuters nightmare/ death trap. "

cadillac,srx,2004,Robert, 08/04/2016,Waste of money,3,"I bought this car with 180,000 miles and in the time it took me to go 4,000 i had to replace the power steering pump twice,the hoses for the power steering, all of the four camshaft position sensors, the alternator, the oil pump, and the oil pressure sensor. I thought i was getting a good deal on a nice vehicle, but i guess i would have been better off throwing the money down a pit.

gives me a feeling like this one. The 
performance and handling of this 
vehicle is superb. I have been driving 
my SRX for more than one month and I 
got so many head-turns. Wherever I park

ordered the SRX with every option 
offered and it is down right 
spectaular.  The build quaility is 
outstanding and superior to my BMW X5 
4.4 that I drove for the past 3 years 
70k miles.  The comfort of the SRX is 
in a class by itself and it literally 
stops traffic with its beautiful 
looks.  Hat's off to GM and the 
Cadillac team for making my generation 
know what it felt like in the early 
days to be a ""Proud Cadillac"" owner.   
I am hooked and so are all of my 
neighbors."

last ten years, this is the most 
satisfied I've been with any car.  
V8/transmission is quiet and smooth as 
any.  Longer wheelbase and AWD gives 
it great handling and confidence in 
winter climates.  Ultraview sunroof is 
unique and very enjoyable to have.  
Pricey when you put it all together,

for."

The SRX handles more like a sports car

handles tight turns and winding roads

extremely comfortable and quiet.  
Positively the best driving experience 
of any car I have everr owned."
cadillac,srx,2004,Diane Kirk, 05/14/2008,SRX,3,I truly enjoy the luxury and the smooth ride that this car provides.  It is very comfortable and easy to handle.  The only problem would be the gas mileage but in this day and time I'm sure none of us are excited about gas prices.
cadillac,srx,2004,King of Murgos, 07/17/2003,Cadillac's RX330,4,"This vehicle really handles like a 
sports car, just like Cadillac 
advertised. The engine is quiet and 
refined. The leather trim inside the 
vehicle is really comfortable and the 
interior materials such as the wood 
trim is excellent and the carbon-fiber 
has improved. The dashboard design is 
excellent and the touchscreen is 
initutitive, you don't have to read 
the manual in order to know how to

like no other. And it is worth the 
price"

Everything was covered under warranty. We looked at several different cars but Cadillac offers the best pre-owned warranty out there. You can get a very good deal on a 3 year old Cadillac with a new car warranty."
cadillac,srx,2004,Super T, 05/27/2010,Never Again,3,"After owning Acura, Lexus and BMW vehicles we decided to try a Cadillac since we thought the SRX was for us.  What a mistake.  GM still doesn't get it.  The sunroof had a rattle that could never be fixed.  Gaps were found in the body panels that were letting water in and causing mold.  You couldn't get out of the car without wiping your leg on the rocker below the door."
cadillac,srx,2004,Charity, 10/01/2010,Transfer Case and Head Light Problems,3,I have had the head light in my Cadillac fixed twice now its time for my inspection and they say I have to pay to get it fixed again.  I think its a defect cause the first time I had it fixed at the Cadillac GMC dealership.   Also my transfer case is messed up when I take off it makes a thud sound.  Anyone know how much it cost to fix a transfer case. Stability system light has been since five months after buying the car.
cadillac,srx,2004,SRX OWNER, 11/03/2003,Comments & Suggestions,4,"First, I love this car. Ride, handling 
and comfort are excellent. Navigations 
system is first rate and easy to use. 
It could stand some improvements. Why 
is there no glove box light or 
underhood light? Why is there no lumbar 
support or telescoping steering wheel 
in a fine car of this caliber?"

cadillac,srx,2004,Unhappy Owner, 06/18/2008,It's Finally Gone,3,The SRX was sold last week with absolutely no regret. We were very excited when we originally bought the SRX because of its looks and performance.  Both of the attributes held to be true to the end.  Interior finish was awful and build quality was about as bad as it could get.  The dealer tried to make things work but Cadillac was very uncooperative.  The sunroof would not function at times and creaked and rattled all of the time.  The engine burned 5 quarts of oil in the last 8k miles driven and Cadillac said that was in tolerance.  The final straw was the sunroof began leaking with water pooling under the third seat.  It really is too bad that the car had to be dumped on the market.
cadillac,srx,2004,P Schultz, 07/01/2008,"I love my SRX, only had cosmetic problem",4,"I love my SRX.  It's fun to drive, has plenty of power.  The only problems I've had with it is cosmetic issues.  My radio dash and door handles started to peel, delaminate.  I had those replaced now everything looks new again, but did notice it will most likely delaminate again.  Other than that, it's a joy to drive and seems very reliable so far."

have one major complaint being that the 
driver & passnger seats do not have 
lumbar adjustments which are quite 
important to us due to back problems. 
Cant understand why a car costing 
$58,000+ cant include this. Also why 
are running boards not available. We 
short people have a hard time stepping 
up to get in. Can we get answer from 
Cadillac regards this? Would slso like

years. I purchased the SRX for more 
storage room on long trips. It is not a 
comfortable vehicle, difficult to get 
in and out of, and the 3rd seat is a 
childs jump seat(10years old max). 16.5 
MPG avg. with the V6. The power 
steering at parking speed is truck-like.
On the other hand the 5 speed 
transmission performs great on the 
highway. If you are a Cadillac owner

2 chey blazers and my last one was an 
Envoy. My husband also had a Navigator 
a few years back.  I was tired of the 
truck-like feel of the Blazer and I 
loved the Envoy. Thinking now that I 
wanted a car, I hated to give up the

all.  It handles like the Germans, rides
comfortable like the Japanese and goes
like heck without punishing the
occupants.    The looks may me a love it

We were really out of Cadallic 
ordinary customers. The GM credit card 
rebate plus $1500 rebate really made 
the deciding point. This SUV is not on 
the top of every category, but 
everything is near perfect.

Want to find out couple years later

This is basically the price of new Toyota Highlander, Ford Freestyle, or Chrysler Pacifica! I added a Certified Pre-Owned package (with 2.9%APR). This is a very good vehicle, but it is not without glitches.  I had the rear wheel hub replaced.  There is corrosion at the rear roof rack pillars.

ML320). The SRX is the best all around 
Vehicle I have owned. Power is just 
right with the V-6. Comfort is tops 
with a smooth ride, but a firm- sporty 
feel. The SRX sits lower than most 
SUVs, giving me the confidence to toss 
it into a corner without fear of 
tipping. Interior is pleasant; seats 
handled a 750 mile trip with no 
discomfort.  All in all, this is GM's 
finest hour."
cadillac,srx,2004,ghfromct, 01/23/2004,Best Car I've Ever Owned,5,"Just an awesome vehicle.  Everywhere I 
go, people stop me to talk about this

past, but this is the first time 
perfect strangers will stop by just to 
check out the car and talk about it.  
Rides like a luxury sedan, and it's 
hard to believe that you're driving a 
vehicle as large as it is.  The V-6 has 
plenty of power, so I wouldn't worry 
about upgrading to the Northstar unless 
money is no object.  Fuel economy is 
solid with the V-6.  I get 22-24 mpg in 
highway driving.  The styling of this

drive. The Northstar engine is 
phenomenal as is the 5-sp auto trans. 
We regularly travel an approximate 50 
miles of twisting, turning, two lane 
road and, other than my ZR1 'Vette, 
I've never had as much fun on that 
route as I have with the SRX. We 
traded a 2003 Infiniti G35,an 
excellent car, due to a move to a cold

passenger space; we have the optional 
third seat. "
cadillac,srx,2004,LPC, 01/25/2006,Never Thought I Would Love a Caddy!,4,"I had just about given up on American cars until I found the Cadillac SRX. Being a picky person with many ideal features I never thought I would find the perfect vehicle. I wanted performance, luxury, and utility plus 7 seats to tote around kids and their friends. Living in a hilly NY area, I needed AWD too. Until the SRX, this combination just did not exist. I was a little weary about American cars, I decided to test drive it and fell in love. The power is just unbelievable and the quality is top notch. It feels so solid compared to our Volvo S60 - they are not in the same league at all. I drive it hard and it responds.

comparing to SUV's only.  Comfort, 
handling, response are all top notch.
The interior is roomy and sporty

wanted.  This car is pure heavenly to 
drive however the price tag is steep

to be one of the top SUV's for ride

interior space is great (especially 
for us folks over six feet).  The six

cadillac,srx,2004,Virginia Haliwell, 03/23/2004,My Cad SRX,4,"I like the looks of the SRX. The 
exterior design makes it easy to see 
out of. Their is plenty of leg room in 
both the front and back seats. On the 
negative side, the consol is not big 
enough to be useful. As a lady driver, 
there is no place to put a purse, or 
other items you may need, such as mail, 
papers, etc. If you don't have a front 
seat passenger, you can put it on the 
seat, but if you have passengers, & put 
it on the floor, there is always the 
chance, it will slip under your feet 
and interfere with the gas peddle."

I was originally interested in the SRX 
because of its automobile size - not 
the monster Escalade. I really 
appreciate Cadillac packaging options 
together, I purchased the Luxury 
performance package with the Ultraview 
sunroof and third row power seat. The 
6cyl has incredible power and I like 
the fuel economy over the 8cyl which 
felt like a rocket ship on wheels.

cadillac,srx,2004,Anderson, 07/24/2006,Two Rears Driving the Cadillac SRX,4,"The Cadillac SRX is a great open road vehicle.  It gets 26 MPG on long trips. Its city gas mileage is not so good though at around 16 MPG.  This truck is fun to drive, has great power for a V6, and has excellent styling.  Its negatives are the unconfortable back seat (too stiff and upright), the V6 is noisy when accelerating, the information center controls are difficult to operate, the very wide door sills makes graceful entry difficult for women and puts dirt on men's slack bottoms, there is no adjustment for the shoulder belt height (where it contacts the neck), and no power opener for the rear hatch.  Also, mine has some door rattles at 35,000 miles.  I would still buy/lease another SRX, but with a V8."
cadillac,srx,2004,William Rahner, 07/24/2006,Excellent road car!,5,"I love the car!  Despite negative reliability ratings from Consumer Reports, the only maintenance issue I've had was the collapse of the two front shock absorbers, which the dealer immediately corrected.  The vehicle has a wonderful ride and great handling characteristics, especially on the highway. It's quiet and comfortable, and the seats are firm and very supportive. My wife, who is not easily impressed with domestic makes, really loves it. It's been great on road trips, averaging 24 MPG on the highway. The Northstar V8, is considerably more thirsty I'm told, but I don't miss the horsepower...the V6 is quite responsive.   I recommend the car without reservation."
cadillac,srx,2004,Ike73, 04/13/2004,A good fit,4,"I had researched this vehicle for quite 
sometime. It proved me wrong once 
behind the wheel. At first I did'nt 
quite like the exterior look for the 
price but onced behind the wheel that 
kind of went out the window. The ride 
over ruff terrain could be alittle 
smoother but it may be better with the 
magnetic ride control. As far as the 
performance and being a Cadillac you 
just can't beat it."

the ""Cadillac ride"" mystique - there is 
really something to it.  V6 engine has 
plenty of power - V8 not necessary.  
Cadillac has earned it's place as a

stepping out of the vehicle. Other than 
that this is truly a World Class car. 
Quality, performance, and workmanship 
are all outstanding. Cadillac is 
truly ""breaking through."" While the 
price is high, you get what you pay 
for. While fuel usage is a little high, 
what do you expect from an AWD 8 
cylinder rocket? While the Navigation 
Display takes a while to get used to it

cadillac,srx,2004,M. O'Rourke, 06/27/2004,2004 SRX V8 AWD,4,"I have owned the car for 1 month and find the 
performance all they promised and more. V8 
power,handling etc. are all top notch. Seats, interior 
trim and materials are not bad but a few notches 
down from BMW. The entire package lacks the 
refinement of the European counterparts but 
Cadillac is learning. Ultraview is great but the sun 
screen shutters wildly at even 40 mph. The high 
belt line gets some getting used to. You kind of feel 
like you are in the bottom of a bucket and the 
sharp angled front door shape can be dangerous, 
my wife 
ran into it the first time she tried to get into the

headache. "

SRX. I love the handling. My kids and I 
really love the ultraview sunroof. The 
dvd player in between the seats is 
actually more kid-friendly in my 
opinion, than those roof screens.
One complaint would be with opening the 
hatchback type back door. It is fairly 
heavy for me (a woman.)I feel like I 
really have to give it a good pull to 
unlatch it. It would have been nice to 
have a remote control door opener 
that ""pops"" it open. An interior driver 
side button to ""pop"" the back door 
would be nice also; something similiar 
to a trunk release type feature. "

Northstar V-8 and 320hp, this is a 
great performance SUV (built on a car 
platform, the CTS).  As with most new 
models, there are some bugs:  rattles 
in the retracting roof and passanger 
door and two small oil leaks which 
required a week to repair.  The engine 
actually has to be dropped to make the 
repair.  This drove the Cadillac 
mechanics to distraction.  The repairs 
were completed and all is now well.  

A fun, convenient vehicle to drive,

performance. The vehicle is definitely a
head turner and several people have
complimented me and my wife on its
looks. Only complaint by my wife has
been the heavy rear hatch for her. Caddy
should consider electrically power
assisted like the old trunks. Drive one
before you buy any other SUV you will be
  impressed with this vehicle."
cadillac,srx,2004,Nanunit, 08/12/2004,Thinking Differently About Cadillac,5,"Cadillac definitely has a winner in 
this SRX!  I never thought that I would 
own a Cadillac, but this car really 
impressed me.  First, I really liked 
the exterior styling--it has a ""cut"" 
look that is very appealing --solid and 
premium.  I think the rounded egg 
design of the Lexus 330 is behind the 
times.  The SRX drives like car, has 
great performnace and is very 
comfortable and refined. The V6 is 
sweet. Given the weight it accelerates 
nicely and effortlessly   The interior 
design is well-integrated--controls are 
easy to use and intuitive and the seats 
are great. The quality exceeded my 
expectations-- I can't find any fault."

Had an ice storm the first month we 
owned it but the AWD handled it without 
any issues. This is our second Cadillac

built auto we have ever owned in the 40 
years I have been buying cars. The 
engine is great the power curve is 
stronger than the MB ever was the

One thing that could use some attention 
is the roof rack, without crossbars it 
really has limited value.

several boring test drives I decided I wanted 
something sportier.   A friend who used to 
own a car dealership told me to look at the 
SRX.  I had not heard of this vehicle at that 
time. 
The first test drive was a base vehicle with no 
options.  On the second test drive I saw the 
large sunroof and knew this car was for me. 
The Stabilitrak is truly amazing on corners or 
in emergency manuevers.  Other pluses 
include the DVD player and OnStar which I use 
all the time. The express up and down on the

averaged 21mpg."

it catches  somewhere in the 
transmission when pushing the gas 
pedal from a complete stop or it seems 
to switch gears at low speeds fairly 
rough.  Will take it in though, has 
two recall, ABS and some front hooks,

We drove all the minivans (some more 
than once) and decided to give the SRX 
a spin based on Edmunds readers making 
it a 'consumer's most wanted'.  We are 
glad we did!  More comfortable and 
stylish and way more fun to drive (I 
drove a 2005 Cadillac STS recently and 
when I climbed back into my SRX, I was 
just as comfortable and sitting higher

the most anoying problems are the
numerous electrical issues that includes
frequent cases of the battery being

When this happened and the car had to be in the shop for some time.  The paint was never the same.  There has been two more recalls since then.  Lastly, the finish on the stereo is peeling.

I spend over 4 hours a day in the SRX and it is fantastic.  It has become difficult for me to get comfortable in other vehicles.  For a V6, it does everything I ask it to do quickly and quietly.  A yound woman co- worker who was riding in the car actually burst out with a ""NICE!"" during heavy on-ramp acceleration.  The AWD is great as it makes the rear slide a tiny bit in cornering so there is no understeer.  Test drive one and you'll never buy a Toyota!"

The comfort for a big guy can't be beat - seriously. So many other SUV driver areas are just too small for me. The SRX's flat-top doors keep the elbows snugly secure from sliding down, as opposed to so many other SUVs' rounded door tops.  I'm able to drive home large purchases with ease (eg, furniture) yet have a smooth (car chassis), safe, elevated ride without any scraping in San Francisco's hilly terrain. The AWD is great for traction.  It's QUIET! The huge sunroof makes it a safe, virtual convertible. It has so many amenities, I can't understand why this isn't the top-rated SUV"

The transmission shifts smoothly and it will go on command at any speed.  It is dangerously fast.  The speed and feel on any road conditions makes the fun to drive index off the charts.  You almost have to be careful.  I don't find the interior cheap looking as others have suggested.  The MPG ratings are BS.  I have averaged about 15 MPG in mixed driving.

Too bad because I love the looks both inside and out. It's comfortable on the highway and very pleasant to drive anywhere. It could have better gas mileage, though.

This was supposed to be my dream car and instead has become my nightmare car.  I will never again own a GM product of any kind unless it is given to me.

cadillac,srx,2005,bernard long, 11/27/2010,Five+ years out,3,"Overall, we have enjoyed our SRX. However it is a GM car.  Seats very comfortable and after a 16 hour drive from SW FL to DC, we were not even stiff. However, this doesn't compare to Lexus, BMW, MB or Volvo in trim quality, fit and finish. Moreover the drive train is suspect.  Replaced the torque converter at just under 50000 miles (warranty); timing chain stretched out due to insufficient lube, I was told, at 70000. N engine is an unannounced oil burner and oil needs changing more quickly than indicated. GM picked up most of the Timing Chain cost ($4000/$4500).  Now (75,000) there is strange noise from under the hood and the smell of coolant.  I would not again buy any early GM or N engine"

cadillac,srx,2005,Buzz dropy, 04/16/2016,2005 SRX,4,"I bought this car in the blind, had no knowledge of the car.  I am pleased with the car overall, but many technology features that are on basic Chevy models are  not on this car.  I have no ports, I cant use bluetooth, I can tether the car to anything.  But the car also makes noise when rides, when taken to the dealer to be checked nothing can be found.  This car also drinks gas like about 12/15 miles per gallon.  Its still the best car that I ever owed. My car has 114k on it and it does not show it its like new.  I have made repairs to the manifold, breaks and their is a light out that I refuse to tackle, as it appears so hard to get to. 

After owning this car for 10 months, I have learned a great deal.  Issues are created on this car for no reason.  I have had issues with the CD player, won't reset and/or work.  The suspension is terrible.  $600 for a wheel bearing.  Air conditioning never worked, $700 repair.  Trade in value is horrible, or that may be me, because I paid to much for the car.  But my biggest surprise was having the blinker/running lights replaced, $375.00 per side.  In order to replace the lights, tires have to be removed and special tools are needed that a normal person would not have bought them and still could not replace the lights, just paid for it.  I have driven this car 7k miles and things just go work.  Thanks Cadillac.  Going to a Lincoln next month.  I had a choice between a Lincoln and this car made a bad decision.

ABS and TRACTION CONTROL module flooded during heavy rain (it's on the bottom of the chasis). Brakes worn out pre-maturely. Rear Windshield washer NEVER worked.

I haven't had much trouble with my caddy. it would jump when it idled so i took it in and just a cylinder was misfiring quick fix and my turn bulb had to be replaced. took it to a caddy dealer and they were horrible so i took it to a gmc dealer and they were great. ive put about 9k on it in the 5 months since i got it and i have to say is i only had about 1 quart of oil when i get it changed at 94k but you just have to watch ur oil. I Love My SRX nothing drives better 
cadillac,srx,2005,review, 04/16/2010,What's the deal?,3,"After reading all the other reviews I know they should recall these cars, was driving car nowhere near time for oil change car started jerking and check engine light came on no light indicated low oil level, took to shop had no oil was over 5 qts low.  Who would ever image that a Cadillac would not have a light to indicate low oil level. Something needs to be done about this problem if only I would have known this before I bought the car never again will I have or recommend this car to anyone"
cadillac,srx,2005,john, 01/16/2009,Don't buy one,2,"This thing is not worth spit. It has way too many reliability problems mainly with the so called ""computer"". Ours went out, they replaced it, then the gas gage indicator stopped working so they reset the computer, then the turn signals stopped and they could not duplicate it then we lost oil but the computer never told us and the dealer didn't know why. We traded it in on a Subaru Forester. The trade-in number was a surprise because it is so low!  GM should go bankrupt putting out this SRX crap for too many bucks. We had 40K miles on it and in the shop 6 times!"

cadillac,srx,2005,herproudmom, 04/28/2005,SRX review,5,This vehicle is very comfortable while sporty at the same time. The third row seat and DVD system rocks as my little girl so frequently says. The traction control and stability system is great. I really can't say anything bad....

cadillac,srx,2005,Kent, 04/03/2010,Oil Problems- GM in denial,2,"Great looking car but clearly a defect in the engine.  As others have reported, you get an oil change an 1500 miles later the car starts shaking. You check the oil, its empty.  No oil leak, no burning smell, just gone. The dealership says they've ""never heard of this problem"" yet people all over the internet report the same problem.  We wanted Russ Darrow, our dealer to find out what was wrong before the warranty ended.  They have done nothing except keep charging us for oil changes (@ $117 each time) and say there is nothing wrong.  Even though randomly for no apparent reason, you'll check the oil and it fine then a week later its 5 quarts low. Its clear there should be a recall on this car."
cadillac,srx,2005,Nothing but trouble, 07/16/2010,Nothing but trouble,2,"I purchased this car used and thought I had gotten a good deal.  Unfortunately in the last two years, I have had nothing but problems with this car.  I just had the water pump replaced ($700), two belts, now the tire monitor isn't working.  I've had to also replaced the power steering lines and parts related to the coolant system.  I feel like I'm in the shop more than anything.  The list goes on re: parts that have needed replacement. On a positive note, it is a very comfortable car and handles amazing on the road.  I wish this car was made to last more than a few years for it's price. Very disappointing.  I don't think I'd ever buy a GM vehicle again. "

When you are driving a luxury car you need to keep up with certain things that you wouldn't need to in a Honda. I have my oil checked after every 100+ mile trip and topped off and get my oil change every 3,000 miles. It's a great reliable car with amazing handling. The gas mileage could be better but no complaints, again a high maintenance vehicle. You need to take care of it though, and commit to regular maintenance, if you can't then you shouldn't be buying luxury."
cadillac,srx,2005,darkspd, 08/26/2008,Pretty but always in the shop!,3,"This car is fun to drive, great power, comfortable and always broken. Every two weeks this car must go in for a major repair (under warranty, thank goodness). Engine (oil leaks and consumption), tranny (went out twice in 2 weeks, factory replacements are terrible, second time they had a local shop rebuild it right), power steering, A/C 4x, drive shafts front and rear, rear differential, sun roof motor (still has intermittent problems), drivers seat and controls, paint (twice), weather striping (doors and sun roof), radio with control display, CD player, interior lights and switches.

cadillac,srx,2005,Brenda, 07/09/2010,Problems with transfer gearbox,3,"The first few months I owned the vehicle I was very, very pleased.  But after six months I had to replace the outside mirror and consistently had a burning smell in the vehicle.  The car was serviced and repaired under the warranty.  When the car reached 88,000 miles the big troubles began. The right and left tie rods, the air conditioner and the transfer gearbox had to all be replaced within a three week period.  To me I did not feel the car was old enough for such problems to begin. I have been a loyal GM customer, but I am seriously reconsidering if I will ever purchase another Cadillac.     "
cadillac,srx,2005,Bill, 03/25/2005,Fun to drive,4,"This is the most responsive vehicle I have ever owned. The down side is, if you are not paying attention, you will be doing 80 mph and not know it. The ride is soft, yet sturdy. The steering is crisp and responsive. Gas mileage at 65 mph is in the 20+ mpg. As stated it's to easy to do 80 and that lowers mpg to around 17.5 mpg. Put a pinstripe above door handles and you have a great looking sports car that is tuff to get stuck in the mud or snow. "
cadillac,srx,2005,Scott, 06/15/2005,Take it back,3,In the 15 months I've owned this car it has been in the shop over 45 days. The large sunroof rattles. Replaced it and still not good. I'm on the 3rd. radio. Still bad. Dead battery problems. The wipers squeak. Dealer can't fix it. There is a burning smell in the car and GM states there is no problem but they suspect the hoses. Amazing. This car is nothing but a rattle trap. I've had more problems with this car than any other car I have. I have an attorney and am going for the Lemon Law in Michigan.
cadillac,srx,2005,Jo Ann, 08/15/2005,Love my SRX,4,"Since I already owned a Cadillac SLS and a small motor home for traveling, I purchased the SRX for the utility aspect that I needed, instead of a small pickup truck. With the 3rd row seats folded down, the SRX gives me plenty of room to haul small to medium loads. I disagree with Edmunds review of the inside.  The wood trim inside as well as the GPS makes my SRX look very impressive. All my friends are blown away by the appearance of the inside as well as the body style. It is the best handling vehicle I have ever owned.  It has quick response, excellent stability control, automatic all wheel drive drive in case I get stuck in the Florida sand. Ultra view moon roof is such a luxury."
cadillac,srx,2005,Jim Prunty, 10/26/2005,Dissapointed,4,"The 2005 Cadillac SRX is a very nice truck if you own a gas station.  With today's technolgy, 12 MPG city and 18 highway is unthinkable for this vehicle.  A Tahoe gets better mileage!  The sunroof is a very nice fearure, but the 3rd row seats are a joke."
cadillac,srx,2005,Bettsey Arnold, 12/14/2005,Disappointed Owner,2,There are several things that I do not like about the 2005 Cadillac SRX.  There are quite a few blind spots that are safety concerns.  The passenger seat and back seats are very uncomfortable.  I have owned other Cadillacs and I am so very disappointed with this one.  I am thinking of trading it in for a GMC Yukon or Ford Explorer.
cadillac,srx,2005,Ruth Donley, 01/03/2006,I love my SRX,5,This is the fifth Cadillac I've owned and the first SUV.  I love the size and the easy handling of this SUV and will never buy a sedan again.   It is so much fun and at age 67 I feel like a kid again when I drive it.  I can honestly say it's the best vehicle I've ever owned not only from a practical and useful standpoint but it looks great.  When I first bought it so many stopped and asked about it and said it looked great.   I love my SRX.

Second, I had to replace the torque converter. Then I had to replace the rear end..AGAIN!  Fourth, my SRX has had repeated oil leaks.  The front timing cover and engine pan also had to be replaced.  I paid $55,000 for a Cadillac SUV and its seats are small, it has no telescoping steering wheel, no digital dash display, no light for the glove compartment, etc. etc. etc.  GM should be ashamed of themselves for this $55,000 SRX. My first Cadillac was a 1962 when quality made a difference and I`ve driven only Cadillacs since. I love the style of my SRX but my satisfaction ends there. I just wrote to my dealer last week but do not expect anything positive back, I just vented my frustrations regarding this vehicle to get it out of my system."
cadillac,srx,2005,hate2land, 10/18/2004,SRXisSensational,5,"Acquired this V6-SRX-RWD in June for my 
wife. I'm ""breaking it in"" for her; 
But, truth be told,I can't part with it.

The 5-speed auto SNAPs off the shifts 
with precision if I need to get on it. 
The V6's variable valve timing pumps 
torque right out of the chute and hits 
255 ft/lbs around 2800RPM. Feels like 
my Mustang-GT. And it can run nicely on 
regular gas.

Build quality is excellent! Seams are 
all in alignment: no gaps. Excellent 
seats and power adjustments. Stock 
stereo rocks.

Handling and ride really surprised me. 
Much better than any GM product I've 
been around. European feel. Only 3800 
miles so far but only one problem.

With no magnetic ride control and standard tires, there is something weird in the handling.  Bumps and uneven pavement throw it slightly off line requiring steering correction.  The steering is heavy and dead feeling with AWD.  For tall guys, the steering wheel is too far away.  We have squeaks and rattles.  Normal aceleration falls flat at 40 mph when it shifts into 4th gear, requiring you to add more throttle, a nuisance.  The engine sounds more like an appliance than a car.  "

cadillac,srx,2005,ep, 10/09/2017,Beware the early LY7 Timing Chain Failure!,1,"This car is a wonderful, comfortable, grocery getter -- a tall wagon on a front engine, rear drive platform with a 4-valve variable timing hemi. It is docile and precise but can roar when you put your foot down. My opinion of it would be far, far more favorable if we hadn't seen the early timing chain failure at a bit over 50,000 miles.  The car was maintained by the Cadillac dealer for the first 30,000 miles. Thereafter I did the maintenance. I changed the oil every 3300 miles regardless of what the oil monitor said. I never even saw a Change Oil message.   One evening we were driving it home up a gentle hill at about 35 mph. There was a horrible noise, grinding, clicking, and it died. We were barely able to pull into an empty parking lot. The left upper timing chain had slipped. The engine had gouged cylinders, two bent rods, a holed piston, and two valves in the sump. Other valve bits and a lot of oil damaged both cats. The only thing salvageable was one head. The dealer wanted $11,000 to repair it because we were out of the LY7 timing chain secret warranty extension program deadlines. I found a new/rebuilt engine for $3500 delivered and did the work myself -- making certain that the timing chain system parts were marked Cloyes True Roller USA -- discovering that it's impossible to change the engine in this car without taking it out/rebuilding it in pieces OR dropping the front subframe in unit. We also experienced the dreaded Cadillac dead car/won't release the key electrical issue which eventually required the replacement of both engine and transmission control units. And at this late date I've run into a number of the 2-hour minor signal bulb replacement issues. This was our last GM product.

Update 2020 -- 60,000 miles on the new engine with a made-in-the-USA Cloyes TrueRoller timing set and a high-volume oil pump. Running like a top -- but only because it's got an engine built correctly, the way GM should have in the first place. There's no way we could replace this vehicle with something as comfortable and practical without spending ten times its bluebook. The engine continues to run so well we treated it to a makeover -- shocks and a suspension refresh, stainless grille work, new headlights, and wide Michelins on 20"" 10-spoke polished Stradas.... the last set in the world that fit the car, we were told. The difference in ride is astounding. The low profile dubs and new shocks really allow the solid platform to shine. A really good basic car, ruined by terrible cost cutting and packaging engineering in the LY7.

We bought this with 70,000 miles on it and it now has 118,000 miles on it and we have put over $9k in maintenance costs in this piece of junk (not including regular maintenance i.e oil changes, tune ups, etc.).  Our car repair shop absolutely love us.  We give them so much business!!!  The SUV gives you the feel of a luxury vehicle with the rear parking assist, leather seats, center console display, OnStar, Sirius/XM capability, power seats, etc. but don't let that fool you.  This car is a lemon and any dealership who sells these cars should be fined!!!  My wife and I are hard working people just like the next people and we don't have the extra money to keep putting money into this piece of SH!+!!!  That $9k could be going to a lot of other things like paying down other debt, putting more money into our children's college fund, funding our emergency fund, getting a better quality vehicle, etc.  I wish I would have read more owner reviews before buying this car.

The second car was even worse, at 65,000 miles the transmission had to be replaced, at 85,000  miles the engine had to be replaced, the catalytic converter had to be replaced. This product is crap. Now the traction control keeps engaging making the car lose power and has almost caused an accident frequently because the car doesn't gain power quick enough. The support from GM sucked.

The car also blew a cylinder at about 20,000 miles and the dealership failed to replace the oil in the vehicle when they repaired it. Had to bring it in again. They blamed it on me.

First it ran hot was towed to dealer that replaced water pump for $300. 2 months later she was driving the car and it started shaking. She took it to the dealer that checked the oil and said it was over three quarts low. They added oil and charged $117.  The engine never leaked or smoked, so where did the oil go. Thee dealer could not tell us . In 2 weeks the check engine light came on. Took to dealer who ran diagnostic and found a cyl was damaged due to low oil. The car was always serviced at dealer with Mobil 1. Tried to get new engine for $8000, but none found, even by two dealers. Finally had a local garage install a used one for $2,800"

After tons of research, I found my SRX & fell in love with the price & the great condition for being used. 36 days into owning it, on a weekend trip, it made some funny noises. We pulled over a lot, but other than the check emissions light, nothing appeared to be wrong. The next morning, I started it up & the engine sounded HORRIBLE! We checked the oil & there WASN'T ANY! We put nearly 6qts of oil in it and took it to the dealer the next day. There wasn't any sign of a leak & the dealer said it hadn't used oil either. It's purred like a kitten ever since & no more oil loss. Has anyone had this happen to them or explain what might have happened?"

My sunroof rattles, and now I have water in the back compartment under the third seat which has caused my headrests to mildew and also my 3rd seat has some mildew areas.  It has been a major inconvenience to find where it is leaking from.  I've read other reviews and on the 2004 model a few customers have had leaks under their 3rd seats from the sunroof.  Has this been a problem for others.  Maybe this is something Cadillac should look in to.  Maybe there should be a recall on this problem before others have to deal with it."
cadillac,srx,2005,Paul, 10/07/2009,battery and ECM,4,The car drives great. Only had one problem a blown fuse. I learned an expensive lesson. If you have the 3.6 V6 do not take the battery lose unless you wait one hour to reconnect. If connected to soon it can either lock the ECM (engine control modual) or worse fry it. In either case the car will not crank and the key can not be removed from the ignition. Now my wife says we should have bought a Lexus.
cadillac,srx,2005,kolber, 01/21/2010,Lousy Quality,3,"I bought 2005 SRX for my wife who always wanted a caddy. I also owned 2006 STS at same time. Have had many problems over and over again with with electronics with car. Now timing chain has broke according to my local garage due to low oil pressure. Since buying this caddy I traded in my STS due to poor quality with all the gadets in the car. The SRX is a great example of nice car not built well. Engine makes lots of noise, and uses oil. When you buy a cadillac you expect a car above the rest! I have owned at least five different cars over past few years and will NEVER buy another cadillac again new or used. I'm now waiting on GM to see if they will take any responsiblity for poor quality car"
cadillac,srx,2005,Margaret, 02/10/2010,Not what I expect from a Cadillac!,3,"This car has been nothing but a HEADACHE! It has been in for repairs more than any of the 8 vehicles that I have owned from other car makers. Seat belt, driver seat, sunroof, steering column, cylinder coil, catalytic converter, lower control arms, front rack and finally changed all engines rings and seals for oil consumption problem that they called normal. Cadillac knows there is an oil consumption problem with the SRX. They say it is normal, but this type of oil consumption is not normal for any vehicle. Do NOT purchase this vehicle! I will empty you wallet and the resale value is low. Our government should encourage them to recall these vehicles. At least Toyota took responsibility."
cadillac,srx,2005,Not What I Expected , 04/07/2010,Big Mistake,4,I cannot believe that GM would build a Cadillac without a sensor to let you know that the oil is low.  The other reviews sound like me.  Had I know that the SRX V6 uses so much oil and there is not a light that tells you there is no oil in the car I definitely would not have bought it.  Driving from LA to Sacramento the car starts jerking but no warning light comes on so I think I just filled up with bad gas and continue to drive another 100 miles.  Well it was not the gas it was no oil in the engine.  I owned the car 4 months and was scheduled for an oil change two days later.  I cannot believe GM does not fix this problem.  The warranty does not cover engine damage due to no oil in the car.

Despite the care we have given the car it is rusting straight through in several places.  In the last four months we have spend over $900 a month in repairs to keep it on the road (excluding tires, oil, etc).  What a money pit.  We went back to buying Toyota again this spring.   "

The SRX is a dream to drive. It is more comfortable than a Lexus and it has superior handling (no fear of rollover on turns). But, I miss the Japanese common-sense engineering.  The location of the AC, heater, and rear window wiper controls on the SRX require your full attention (eyes off the road) when adjusting.  You cannot avoid rubbing the backs of your legs on the rocker panels when exiting the car (this gets them very dirty when raining or snowing).  There is no remote gas cap lid (you have to buy a locking gas cap like we did in the 70's).  Lastly, the second row seats do not fold flat. "

cadillac,srx,2005,Luis R Diaz, 02/15/2005,From the Caribbean,5,"After using the SRX for over 1 year, I still feel very pleased with my decision to buy one. The commodity of getting in and out of the SRX separtes it from most SUV's. On many occasions I have received very possitive comments from people of all ages regarding the looks of this vehicle."
cadillac,srx,2005,Ian Echeverria , 03/25/2005,Well worth it,4,"I have to admit that after test driving the Volvo XC90, Lexus RX330, and VW Tourag that I was impressed by the handling and quaility of the SRX. Comparing size, class, and options it is the best in class in my opinion. What's best about the Cadillac SRX is the the price beats the other 3 and the quality doesn't suffer. Finally an American SUV that competes with the others and can hold its ground. If you don't believe take it for a drive and feel the difference."
cadillac,srx,2005,abc, 04/09/2005,Excellent SUV,4,"Although it's a large car, I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle rather than an SUV.  It's a great feeling after 9 years of heavy SUV driving.  Cadillac, you did it!"
cadillac,srx,2005,Frank McElveen, 04/15/2005,Good vehicle,4,"Good SUV, comparable to my wife's Lexus Rx300. More power, less engine noise, better handling, even more quiet. The additional woodgrain package is a must for appearance...makes it look $1,000 better. Needs the same addition that was placed on the Lexus. A bummper cover in the rear to keep marks off of the top of the bumper.  Very good vehicle so far, 2,500 miles. "
cadillac,srx,2005,del rae, 04/28/2005,New Cadillac SRX,4,The wife and I love this truck.  The only thing we think they could have do better on the door interior door panels should have a leather trim or some thing we looked at a inf and a Lexus but not happy with the lack of power.  I drive a 2004 Dodge Ram Pickup 1/2 ton hemi and love it as you can see the wife likes power.
cadillac,srx,2005,Tom C., 05/12/2005,Cadillac SRX owner comments,3,"We've driven the SRX 3,000 miles since the purchase 45 days ago.  1/3 of it on a long trip; the remainder has been city driving.  We use the speed control whenever possible and avoid 'rabbit' starts in stop and go driving.  Both my wife and I have 50 years of driving experience, most of it with GM and Toyota vehicles.  We have the six cylinder model and optional rear seats so it seats 7."
cadillac,srx,2005,tahoe66, 05/17/2005,"Noisy, Spirited SRX",4,"Having had 9 Tahoes, I expexted a vehicle at least as quiet in the SRX. The AWD mated with the V6 is agile, spirited and fun to drive, but much busier sounding than our Trailblazer at 14 grand less. Fuel economy not much better than the Tahoe (the only reason I switched). Seats are superb, navigation system is great, but one needs the eyes of an eagle to read the clock & temp. Ultraview roof is a mixed bag, big open air feeling, noisy when open, creaks open or closed. Third row seat should not be powered, takes forever to raise and lower. Over all quality less than I had hoped for, but nothing major, just small annoyances. Can not believe XM radio and rain sensing wipers weren't standard."
cadillac,srx,2005,silver streak, 05/18/2005,Handles Like a Sport Sedan,4,"The most impressive thing about my SRX is the ride.  Very responsive, roomy and the kids love the third row of seats.  Living in the sunbelt, I have a RWD 6 which is quite responsive without breaking the bank at the fuel pumps (runs fine on regular).  Ultraview sunroof is like driving an SUV convertible.  I made a smart decision in choosing this vehicle."
cadillac,srx,2005,Bill, 05/26/2005,Very Happy with my SRX,5,"Last December my Mercedes-Benz broke down. I went to this Cadillac dealership to take a look at their Escalade and saw the SRX. After the test drive, I immidiately ordered mine. For the last six months, I did not regret a bit. It drives better than a sedan, more than enough power although mine is a V6, feels save and very comfortable. Best of all, it bears an American name. (Just for those of you that wonder, I was not born here.)"
cadillac,srx,2005,robhersch, 05/29/2005,Rob's SRX Review,4,"Selected after ""driver's trials"" with the V6 & V8 comparisons at El Toro; Special ordered Nov '04, BlueChip / Ebony, std V8 w/trailer pkg; delayed delivery due to plant shutdown & snow; worth waiting for; wife loves quiet ride, styling, leg room, moon roof & other goodies; I like the vehicle size, driver's road height, adj lumbar, leg room, shifter tran & performance, especially on the mountains between LA & Vegas; would prefer regular gas vs. premium but will keep tank full anyhow; mileage reasonable for V8 power about as advertised; ride stiffer than typical luxury sedan, but better than most, and great when coupled with the super handling on narrow winding roads; don't plan true off-roading but will do ""local-bad"" roads."
cadillac,srx,2005,jim, 06/01/2005,SRX Equals Fun,4,The SRX handles like a luxury sedan. The V8 engine is fast in its response and you can not tellhow fast your going as the handling is flawless. The SRX offers great visiability looking forward but has some interference due to third row headrests. The leather seats are adjustable to accomadate any size driver comfortably. The controls and guages are also conveniently displayed. The vehicle does lack some convenience storage space compared to other vehicles I have had. The up side is that I do not keep things in the vehicle I do not need for months on end.
cadillac,srx,2005,duque, 06/12/2005,Happy Cadillac customer,4,This truck is extremely comfortable with a long wheel base which absorbs bumps easily. It has convenient controls and cofortable seating. The space is a blessing!
cadillac,srx,2005,Robert Gingras, 06/13/2005,Company Vehicle,4,"Overall, vehicle is fun to drive and very functional in all weather conditions.  The six-cylinder engine privides ample power and the seating is fine for four adults. ( without the added third seat ) gas mileage averages around 20 mpg.  I would consider another SRX when my lease is up on this one."
cadillac,srx,2005,Jburns, 06/26/2005,Cadillac SRX - Great Vehicle,4,"The SRX has just the right amount of storage space for our frequent trips to the sunny south. The ride and handling is excellent. The step-in height is a little high, for a small person. Plenty of power in all conditions. Gas mileage good for a 4,400 lb. vehicle. The large sunroof is great, but for highway driving its to windy and you need the additional pop-up 3rd row seat conventional sunroof only. "
cadillac,srx,2005,Joyce, 06/29/2005,Our SRX saved our lives,4,"While traveling South to Florida,we had a very bad accident in our brand new SRX. We hit the guard rail, went airborn into the northbound lane on I 95 in Virginia and then rolled over 8 times, hit a tractor trailer truck twice and landed, straped in our seat belts, in the car but upside down on the roof. The car was demolished but the passenger section had about 3 feet of room between us and the bottom of the car. We both had very significant injuries but when the police arrived on the scene they expected to find fatalities not people who were alive. Our dog was in a dog car seat in the second row and she survived with NO injuries. We have replaced the car (even the same color). Love the car."
cadillac,srx,2005,esmurrell, 07/09/2005,Switched and proud,5,"This is the first American vehicle I have purchased and I couldn't be happier!  Couldn't resist the deal (everyone buys @ employee price) and the style and performance leave nothing to be desired.  Just returned from a 2,800 mile road trip and the vehicle performed flawlessly!  Gas mileage is 23+ MPG, the stereo and rear seat entertainment system lived up to their promises.  The comfort is second to none.  Seats, driving position quietness, etc. make this a family hauler bar none.  Handling in the mountains was sure footed and confidence inspiring.  Get lots of lucks of approval and/or admiration.  If this car performs well over time, I will switch to American with the other one as well.  "
cadillac,srx,2005,Vinnie , 07/10/2005,Cadillac SRX,4,My Cadillac SRX is a fun SUV that does not drive and feel like a truck. The 6-cyl. engine is very fast and all I need for the road. I also like it that there are not many of these on the road everywhere and people want to know what is it. It looks clean and has the Cadillac quality and prestige.
cadillac,srx,2005,Larry C, 07/21/2005,Best one I ever owned,4,"By far the best I ever owned.  We traded a Highlander on this SRX, worlds of difference.  Fun to drive, probably the safest SUV on the market.  I can see why it's SUV of the year two years running.  We opted for the storage as opposed to the third row seating as we are empty nesters.  The V-6 is quick and smooth, the only improvement could be a automatic rear door.  The ultraview is great.  Best SUV we ever owned.  Employee pricing makes it even better! Great car, great deal, makes driving fun again!"
cadillac,srx,2005,Albee, 07/23/2005,Who says SUV's can't be comfortable?,4,"My Grandfather used to drive his Caddy to Florida every year. I always thought of Caddies as ""senior citizen's vehicles"". Well no more! I have been driving foreign cars for the last 20 years, but decided to look at the new Cadillac's which appealed to my eye, but what about build and performance? The quality so far is letter perfect. The car runs on regular fuel and the dealer service was as good as Lexus or any other foreign car. They finally got it right.  Step on the gas and you really don't believe there's a 6 under the hood. No need for the optional V8 here. The other day, the ""car"" informed me that the front left tire had low (23psi) pressure. There was a nail in my tire. How about that? This truck has safety too."
cadillac,srx,2005,slim63, 07/25/2005,2005 Cadillac SRX,4,I have only had the vehicle for a week but so far it is the best I've ever owned. Looked at the Lexus and BMW because of the 3rd row seat in them. The comfort and performance is amazing. Will update after a few months.
cadillac,srx,2005,David F., 07/25/2005,Very Happy with First Cadillac,4,"This is my first Cadillac and third SUV.  So far very happy!  My SRX is fully loaded with sunroof, navigation system and rear DVD.  Eveything works great.  Had a problem with a vibration in the center console, but my dealership fixed it right away.  I wish it did have better gas millage, but with any SUV you should never expect great fuel economy.  "
cadillac,srx,2005,Angel Saraniero, 08/15/2005,I Love My SRX!,4,"I traded in a 2001 Mercedes-Benz C320 for this vehicle.  We needed more room because we just had a new baby and all the car seats wouldn't fit. I also wanted something with better handling in the winter than the Mercedes. So I picked the SRX-we added the dual DVD players-so the kids would be thrilled. I got the car with the AWD, which will be great in these harsh upstate NY winters. The only thing I really dislike is the horrible gas mileage.  We have taken a few highway roadtrips, and are only averaging 17 mpg highway. Other than that this car is just like an SUV, more room, great layout, family friendly and the sunroof is amazing! I read some reviews here before I bought the SRX and these helped decide me!"
cadillac,srx,2005,jjmd, 08/15/2005,Completely Satisfied,4,"This automobile has it all.  It has plenty of room for the family, yet is loads of fun to drive.  The acceleration and handling are like that of a much smaller car.  I am sold on the Cadillac brand now and I was quite skeptical when I purchased the car."
cadillac,srx,2005,Deb C., 08/26/2005,I love this car. My best Cadillac ever!,5,We recently leased this car and are very pleased with it. I traded in my Escalade because it was too big and not good in gas mileage. The SRX has everything that we need and came fully loaded with the exception of the navigation and DVD system. We have are own. It is fun to drive and easy to figure out with the included CD. We love the looks of the car and so does everyone else. There is no other car like it as I have been looking at smaller SUVs and none of them have the cargo space or the looks and options such as the SRX. The 6 Cyl/AWD is great. I have no complaints with this car. The dealership is great as well as the employee discount. This is my first lease program. Works out great!
cadillac,srx,2005,Drivin' Hard, 09/27/2005,A Winner for Cadillac,4,"Just finished the first three months of ownership of my new SRX and am very pleased with the car. After testing both the eight cylinder and the six cylinder engines I opted for the 3.5L six and am not at all disappointed since I find the power is totally adequate. It rides and handles well and combines the best of an SUV and a sedan. On long trips it's as comfortable as my '04 Escalade and not as thirsty. Some have criticized the exhaust note, but I find it pleasing and not at all intrusive. So far everything works as advertised with no problems. Cadillac seems to want to make sure it's owners have an overall excellent ownership experience and I'm certainly very satisfied."
cadillac,srx,2005,Sweets, 11/08/2005,My SRX,4,"I love my new Cadillac SRX.  It is the most comfortable SUV that I have ever ridden in or driven.  I know they say they are going to make improvements, but as far as I am concerned, it dosen't need any.  "
cadillac,srx,2005,Jason, 01/05/2006,Great Family Vehicle,4,"We love the Cadillac SRX.  The sunroof is amazing, don't buy one without it.  It drives like a car, but offers most of the convienances of an SUV.  The third row seat is great for people that only use it on occassion and the stadium style seating makes the kids feel part of the action vs. being seclueded behind the second row.  Still, the thrid row seat is only made for kids.  Its gas mileage is acceptable, not as bad as an SUV, but not as good as many cars.  The styling is awesome.  It is what sets the vehicle apart from others and always turns heads.  It has a great stereo, easy to use navigation system and a very quite ride.  I have no major compliants.  The wide door jams are a bit odd and take some getting use to."
cadillac,srx,2005,Richard Balling, 03/28/2006,Not as good as expected,3,"The engine in my Cadillac SRX is noisy on acceleration.  It whines like a car trying to shift out of first gear.  Also, there is not enough room in the back seat (second seat).  It has a very stiff ride."
cadillac,srx,2005,ParVenu Playboy, 07/10/2006,One year old and not one bug or repair,4,"This is the first American car I've bought in 20 years. So far it has not had one single bug (unlike my BMW's that go computer out of control). I got every option available and love the huge sunroof, magnetic glide ride and Bose stereo system. The first generation satellite radio cut out all the time in the city. The only regret I have is the poor gas mileage. My SRX only gets 11 mpg in the city and 18.5 on the highway."
cadillac,srx,2005,Gary, 07/24/2006,Great Ride,4,My 2005 Cadillac SRX is the best vehicle I have ever owned!  No other Crossover SUV is even close to the ride and comfort of my Cadillac SRX.  I test drove the BMW and Benz before buying my SRX and the SRX is head and shoulders above the other two. Believe it or not this is the first American car that I have ever owned! Great job by Cadillac with this vehicle.

handling and comfort add up to pure 
luxury.  My 6'2"" son tells me the back 
seat is most comfortable he's been in.  
The third row seat is small and only

third seat."
cadillac,srx,2005,RPM220, 08/24/2004,Best Luxury Performance SUV out there,5,"Compared the SRX to the X5 and Cayenne 
it won hands down. Excellent 
combination of style, versatility, and 
performance. The ride is a lot smoother 
than the competition without a handling 
penalty. The third seat is also 
somehting else that comes in handy at 
times that no one else in the class 
seems to offer. The SRX has plenty of 
gadgets to keep anyone busy and the 
Ultraview roof is a must have option. 
So far the car has been solid and 
dealership service has been excellent. 
Also note that the SRX can run on 
regular fuel which is a nice cost 
savings at the pump"

cadillac,srx,2005,Lupe, 09/14/2004,Love my SRX,4,"My SRX is the perfect blend of SUV & 
car with the best of both.  For those 
who are tired of SUV's that drive like 
trucks and tired of mini-vans and want 
true distinctiveness & luxury, this is 
the vehicle.  The ""pick-up-and-go"" on 
the V6 is great, pleaty of power & 
speed - I like the downshift feature 
built into the gear shift for when you 
need the extra punch to merge or pass.  
The SRX is the perfect combination of 
practicality for a working mom and 
trendy style and luxury for a 
professional.  The interior luxury 
appointments are first rate and the 
features and controls are easy to 
navigate.  The car generates a lot of

about a month. Not one problem so far. 
If you want the fastest most fun to 
drive SUV made than look no farther 
than the SRX! Average gas mileage so 
far is 16.7mpg in mixed driving, but we 
didn't buy the V8 to get good gas 
mileage. It's simply a sports car 
disguised as a SUV. ;-)
We're planning a 2000 mile shopping 
trip soon. I think it ""should"" have 
plenty of room. The ride is stiffer 
than the our 2002 Seville was, but it's 
very well controlled and doesn't wander 
at all."

cadillac,srx,2005,fjordan, 11/09/2004,The special aftermarket packages u need,4,"right, there are 2 pacakges you
definitely need to add in addtional to
the bare-bone base model (V6 RWD).

1. luxury package .  (Not
lux-performance pkg, which is a hoax and
buy you nothing more than more cost of
gasoline...)

2. After market:  wood-view package.
the reason is that the original design
of SRX's central panel is a bit
blackish, and the added flavor of wood
trim will make the interior 200% more
gorgeous, classic and impressive.

Beyond these 2 packages, the Caddy SRX
seats are just as comfortable as any
mercedes.

The acceleration is the best in the
bunch as compared with Porsche Cayenne
or X5."
cadillac,srx,2005,GRC, 11/13/2004,Perfect size,4,"Having been the driver of Duallys, 
trucks and large SUVs over the last 20 
years, I am delighted with the roomy 
compactness of the SRX.  I still feel 
high enough up off the road to be 
comfortable, and I don't worry about an 
entire Honda Accord (or the like) being 
obscured & hidden in the blind spots as 
is the case with driving large SUVs.  
The SRX wheels into the smallest of 
parking spaces with as much ease as any 
small car.  It handles effortlessly and 
is a pleasure to drive.  Cadillac 
appears to still be King of Bells & 
Whistles."

cadillac,srx,2005,burt caplan, 11/17/2004,happy customer,4,"excellent vehicle to drive and nice 
looking.
controlls very hard to operate, heater 
and air very small buttons and you must 
take eyes off road to operate. also 
very hard to exit as you have about 
three inches of metal to swing legs 
over. would like better gas milage but 
like that i can use regular gas.if 
vechicle continues to operate like now 
would purchase another."
cadillac,srx,2005,Robert Hofmann, 11/15/2004,Cadillac's best yet,4,"This is my 16th Cadillac and I love it. 
It handles well, rides well. Holds the 
road great. Quieter than I expected it 
to be. Plenty of power to over take 
most vehicles on the road. "
cadillac,srx,2005,cadillacjeff, 11/11/2004,LOVE THAT SRX,4,"A blast to drive.  Great seats and 
sound system.  More electronic features 
than I will ever use. Eight's 
acceleration is breathtaking! Quiet, 
comfortable, safe, and stable in all 
weather."
cadillac,srx,2005,drinks2u, 11/11/2004,Slik meets Corporate world,5,"This is the most comfortable and 
economic car in the luxury class.  I am 
a petite woman and find the ride 
appealing.  I am in my mid-20s; Cadillac has 
always appealed to the older generation 
but has now appealed to the Generation X 
clan!!  Thanks and I would recommend 
this car to anyone who can afford this 
price range!!!!!"
cadillac,srx,2005,BUTLER, 11/28/2004,SUV,4,"Having a DeVille as previous car, the 
ride is not as smooth but for a SUV it 
handles and rides great.  Having the 
glass top for viewing is really great 
and to ride with it open does give the 
feel of conv. But only drawback is I 
can't have satellite radio on the model with 
the glass top.  Gas mileage on the 
highway is disappointing for a six cyl. 
car it comes at barely 22mpg.  My 
biggest problem is that my wife loves 
it and I rather have a DeVille."
cadillac,srx,2005,EG, 12/15/2004,The 2005 Cadillac SRX is My Favorite Vehicle,4,"The 2005 Cadillac SRX is a wonderfully comfortable
vehicle to drive. The 6-cyclinder engine could be a 
little peppier, espectially when getting onto highways.
I found the steering to be tight and excellent."
cadillac,srx,2005,t. Stefan, 12/15/2004,The SRX is Simply the Best,4,"The 2005 Cadillac SRX is smooth,speedy, and agile.
It is great fun to drive with performance that may startle
you.  If you're looking for a beautiful, refined, 
performance SUV with great styling; drive this one.  
This might be the best vehicle that I've ever owned."
cadillac,srx,2005,Bobby, 01/01/2005,Best Vehicle I have Driven in Over 30 Years,4,"Without a doubt the 2004 Cadillac SRX is
one of the best vehicles I have owned and
driven in over 30 years. It has all the features
you want in a vehicle like this. You don't know what 
you are missing till you go out and 
drive an SRX."
cadillac,srx,2005,Mary Courim, 01/01/2005,Good Looking,4,"My 2005 Cadillac SRX is great for everyday errands

a small woman like myself."
cadillac,srx,2005,A. Ferguson, 01/01/2005,very pleased,4,"Overall, I am very pleased with Cadillac SRX.
I have an AWD V6 version with all the extras. 
I have found the navigation system, which I find
priceless,and my kids love the DVD system
and the Ultraview roof. I love the handling of this SUV. 
It's very easy to drive and doesn't 
seem like I'm driving a truck. I have 
test driven other SUVs that are hard to 
manuever."
cadillac,srx,2005,Diane, 01/05/2005,Cadillac SRX,5,I went from a large SUV to the Cadillac SRX.  It is the best move that I have made.  The SRX is easy to drive and has excellent handling.  I enjoy all the Cadillac luxury options. The interior is roomy and I do not feel confined.
cadillac,srx,2005,njfla, 01/05/2005,My SRX,4,"A great vehicle to drive, holds the 
road well, comfortable, plenty of room 
for 5 adults, a dog, gifts, 2 suitcases 
and a ham to travel 300 miles on 
Christmas.  Mileage 23 MPG highway, 16 
and a half around town.  Not bad!  "
cadillac,srx,2005,john williams, 01/05/2005,brand new,4,"I compared thsi car with a host of 
SUV's in the same price/feature range 
(Lexus, BMW, Volvo, Acura, Mercedes). 
There was no question once I test drove 
this car. Handling is a dream! Power in 
the mountains (colorado) is remarkable 
and equals the turbo charged Saab 9.5se 
that my wife drives. Excellent 
comfort/interior for driver and 
passengers. Learning the computer and 
all its features is a bit time 
consuming and somewhat complicated. 
visability (rear side views from driver 
seat) is not great."
cadillac,srx,2005,Bill, 01/16/2005,Enjoying My Wife's SRX,4,"I am used to peppy cars as the car that I turned in was a Cadillac STS, point being is that the 265 Hp Cadillac SRX provides me with all the pep I need.  To top this off it is fueled with regular gas. It also gets good gas mileage on trips and around town.  I truly enjoy driving this attention getting vehicle.  Lexus and Mercedes-Benz people are always examining it wherever I drive.  It is dolled up very nicely with pearl white paint and gold striping.  I added a set of chrome wheels later on.  The origial wheels looked almost plastic, very distasteful.  However our salesman suggested we have the original ones chrome plated, well that was the iceing on the cake.  Now you know why I enjoy driving my wife's SRX."
cadillac,srx,2005,lawsbc, 01/16/2005,2005 Cadillac SRX,5,"The 2005 Cadillac SRX  is quiet, responsive, and economical.  The inside cargo space is deceiving, it provides more than adequate storage.  The V6 engine makes one forget the need for a V8."
cadillac,srx,2005,Eagle, 01/16/2005,I Love It,5,"I had a 2003 Cadillac Escalade.  My new 2005 Cadillac SRX is so fun to drive! It gets pretty darn good gas mileage, but who cares when it is so fun to drive.  Getting in takes a little getting used to, because of the wide threshold. I love the Bose sound system. The wood trim is beautiful (I am not so fond of the black dash).  Overall, this is one of the best vehicles that I've owned."
cadillac,srx,2005,Merle, 01/23/2005,2005 Cadillac SRX,4,"My 2005 Cadillac SRX is still a new vehicle, but so far so great!  It has a very cool and unique looking exterior design.  I have the V6, which seems to have plenty of power for this vehicle.  The enormous sunroof is amazing.  It has plenty of room inside, but not a huge SUV feel.  It also has a very smooth ride on the highway, a terrific sound system (Bose), and rich looking interior.  I haven't tested it in much snow yet, I but am confident it's all I need."
cadillac,srx,2005,RobinClem, 02/21/2005,"Extras, Good and Bad",4,"The 2005 Cadillac SRX is a lovely car and lots of fun to drive.  Do not, however, get the third seat unless you regularly transport children.  it is not good for adults, and the alternate, lots of nifty little hampers, is very welcome.  Cadillac will practically give you the car if you don't want the sun roof, so think that over.  (It's awesome, however, for those that like sun roofs.)  After six months, I may have used the navigation system three times, all in the first two weeks.  For us, OnStar is a must, and we actually used it in an emergency."
cadillac,srx,2005,ms, 03/04/2005,Converted to SUV's,4,"Changed from a Jeep Grand Cherokee to my 2004 Cadillac SRX and what a difference. I had never liked SUV's and now drive the SRX everywhere just for fun.  It accelerates well, is great looking, and much better at braking than the Grand Cherokee was. I would recommend it to everyone."
cadillac,srx,2005,Ms. SRX, 03/06/2005,I love it!,4,"Buying this SUV was an excellent choice.  It is the perfect size, specifically when you have kids (it is not too tall.)  The powered third row is a plus!  The entertainment system is excellent, specifically the location of the DVD!  However, it is noisy.  You will hear everything around you even if you have the radio and AC on."
cadillac,srx,2005,phil donohue, 03/10/2005,We Love Our Cadillac,5,"This is our first new Cadillac, and it is a superb vehicle. From every aspect, we love this vehicle. It has a superb ride, great acceleration, very comfortable on long trips, nimble and very fuel efficient. A truly perfect vehicle for our family."
cadillac,srx,2005,M, 03/15/2005,Love at first drive,4,"I test drove, test drove, and test drove.  I drive for work every day, so I wanted to be prepared for the purchase.  I also have 4 kids, so I needed at least 6 seats.  I looked at every Nissan Minivan & SUV + the Infiniti, Toyota, Mazda, Chrysler, Ford, etc.  I wanted at least a V6, 4WD-AWD, 6+ seats, leather interior.  This easily brought me into the $30k+ ballpark.  I took my first test drive in the SRX right after it was released (V8, etc) and as soon as I nailed it coming off a ramp onto the highway, I was hooked.  I also tote folks around for work, so the HUGE back seat was great.  Not minivan cavernous, but definitely SUV huge.  You'll love it from your first drive. "
cadillac,srx,2005,Melitas Forster, 03/18/2005,We love this auto,4,"We were fortunate to get a certified used SRX, loaded, it is so beautiful in every way. Great ride with the AWD and handles beautifully. Love it. "
cadillac,srx,2005,DK, 03/19/2005,Great ride,4,"Highly recommend this vehicle.  Handles superbly, fast as a rocket with the V8, great interior room for a tall driver."
cadillac,srx,2005,J.Dillon, 05/06/2005,Great Drive and Performance...But,3,"Many areas of concern. Navigation/Radio/Dic system is a mess. Poor lighting-impossible to control. No compass. Clock-temperature characters are too small. Needs to be completely redsigned. Can't program so that doors won't lock when in gear.  Very dangerous. Front seats are very hard and uncomfortable. My passengers share this view. Can't open back window which is a design flaw. Rear hatch door is heavy. Should be able to ""pop"" it open. Would like to have true keyless entry like Ford products with combination numbers on exterior of car.  Car drives and handles very well. If GM fixes the above issues I will trade for another. If not, I will trade for a Ford product this fall."
cadillac,srx,2005,Fred, 05/09/2005,It's Not A GMC Denali!,3,"Had 2004 GMC Denali before this I got my 2005 SRX V6 AWD - Likes: ride / drives well, looks great. Dislikes: city mileage is only about 14.5 MPG. I do not like the wide door stills! It's very hard to get into and out of the vehicle without getting dirt on your pants. This is not good! On the first weekend, I washed the vehicle and had a major water leak in the left upper corner of the windshield and ran down onto the dash, nice for new car. But they did fixed it! Why a 3:91-1 final drive (ratio)? RPM is approx. 2,300 - 2,400 at 70 MPH."
cadillac,srx,2005,SRX-V8, 05/21/2005,Comfort Exemplar,5,"After driving a Jeep for several years, the Cadillac is very comfortable and we feel well worth the money spent. The Northstar engine is smooth and from all indications one of the best on the market."
cadillac,srx,2005,jrtrock, 06/03/2005,Better than a Lexus and cheaper!!!,4,"Test drove  Lexus 330RX, Infiniti, etc. The Caddy was the best deal and the best driving....a great vehicle at a great price."
cadillac,srx,2005,Pam Foerstner, 06/03/2005,You need to test drive this car!,5,"I previously drove a Lincoln Navigator and wanted to downsize without sacrificing any of the luxury features.  I was impressed by the body style of the SRX, but when I drove it I knew I had found my car.  This car is so much fun to drive that I regularly catch myself doing 90 mph on the highway without realizing it.  When I drove the car at the dealership, I told the salesman that I was interested in purchasing an SRX.  He asked me when I would like to come back to pick the car up and I said that I would be taking the car home that night.  I have not been disappointed!  I love this car.  "
cadillac,srx,2005,TW, 06/21/2005,SRX,4,I researched my next vehicle for over a year.  Glad I picked the SRX.  It has the 3rd row seat for times we need extra room and has great handling.  Never thought I'd want a Cadillac but they're on a roll lately with the new designs.  Only have had for a month but we're rolling up the miles.
cadillac,srx,2005,Art, 07/14/2005,Storage,4,I was amazed to find that the rear storage does hold golf clubs either across or front to back in the storage area without putting down the 2nd row seats. 
cadillac,srx,2005,Edye Weller, 07/30/2005,SRX survey,4,"This SRX is so easy to drive and handle, also on long road trips and so very comfortable. Loved the memory seats. the lift gate is easy to close and I am 5'. The back of the SRX has a plug in for a small refrigerator and we use it when we travel. We also like all the conviences for all the passengers, heat and air, all the storage and cubby holes for thing."
cadillac,srx,2005,Troy, 07/31/2005,Troy,4,The Cadillac SRX  has great utility and curb appeal and it drives like a sports car rather than like a truck.  It has more power than all other SUVs except for the Poirsche Cayenne.
cadillac,srx,2005,francosuisse, 08/02/2005,Porsche owner buys the Caddy,4,"As an owner of a Porsche 911 C4, I was going to buy a Cayenne S.  But after I test-drove both the Porsche and the Cadillac SRX, there was no hesitation anymore.  The SRX feeling on the road is much better than the Cayenne (probably the magentic ride control).  I also add the impression that it was better performing than the Porsche (esp. the auto 5-speed transmission is better tuned to the engine)."
cadillac,srx,2005,Richard Guizlo, 08/05/2005,Back in a Cadillac,4,"After a ten year hiatus, I decided to give Cadillac another shot, and so far I'm really glad I did.  I am really enjoying my SRX.  It is a great ride, and so far I have zero complaints.  I chose the SRX over BMW X-5 and Infiniti FX35 because I couldn't see paying that much more for those."
cadillac,srx,2005,Frank, 08/06/2005,"4,000 Miles & Counting",5,"Only negatives include less than optimum visability with rear seats in up position, cargo shade/cover not very durable and limited storage space in real area.  The ride at slow and high speeds is exceptional, pick up great and overal handling above average.  We just returned from a trip that started in the Atlanta area, to Cleveland, Ohio, Milwaukee, WI, Indianapolis Indiana, through Kentucky, Tennessee and back to Georgia without a hitch.  It is just a fun vehicle to drive."
cadillac,srx,2005,Triple R, 08/09/2005,Barely a luxury SUV,3,"I just got my 2005 SRX today and found it to be a decent SUV. It has a very attractive exterior and a decent engine. But one you get inside everything disappoints. The ""leather"" felt more like vinyl and their is way to much rubber and plastic everywere. The entire interior felt cheap. Compared to my parents' Acura MDX has a much more luxurios feel and real leather. I found the engine to be annoyingly loud in comparison to the MDX. I did enjoy the handling of the SRX quite a bit though as it felt like I was driving my TL instead on a Minivan. My biggest gripe is the fact that my friend's Accord (and naturally my TL) are much more luxurious then this ""Luxury"" SUV. GM's gotta work on interiors. "
cadillac,srx,2005,Fred Oldencott, 09/16/2005,Great car,4,I have nothing but good things to say about my Cadillac SRX. It is fast enough for me and a comfortable road car. It has a functional interior and superb handling along with decent gas mileage.
cadillac,srx,2005,Mike, 12/21/2005,2005 Cadillac SRX AWD V8,4,"The 2005 Cadillac SRX has excellent handling and is very quick and very stable in all driving conditions. The cabin is very comfortable, we have a 6'2"" son who can sit comfortably in the back seat. We enjoy the sunroof a lot."
cadillac,srx,2005,fyreman235, 03/15/2006,A Real Looker,4,"I love the Cadillac exterior styling.  I guess it is a love-it-or-hate-it thing!  I bought it with 2,000 miles as certified used vehicle with a 100,000 mile warranty.  It has already been on a 5,000 + mile round trip, and I have very few complaints.  It performed well in all circumstances including snowy mountain roads in Colorado. The navigation system always gets you there, but not always by the best route. "
cadillac,srx,2005,First Caddy, 09/06/2006,Best Vehicle that I've Owned,4,I love my Cadillac SRX.  Driving it through the north Virginia mountains with the roof open in late spring was a great vacation.
cadillac,srx,2005,Valerie, 09/09/2006,I Love my Car!,4,"I find the SRX to be very comfortable, easy to drive, and convenient for traveling or shopping.  It handles well and feels secure,  even on slippery or snow covered roads in winter. I really would have liked to have the pull-out visor extensions on the sun visors...they are not really a luxury, but a necessity, at times. Occasionally, the electrical system goes out of whack, unlocking the doors for no reason while I am driving.  If I leave a door open for a long time, as when unloading groceries, the memory goes out and I have to reprogram my seat position controls.  Occasionally, the sunroof sticks open, but I have always been able to get it working by myself.  Other than that, I love it."
cadillac,srx,2005,Richard Grahman, 10/10/2006,"Cadillac SRX, 2005",4,I have purchased 8 new vehicles over the past 12 years and this is by far the best handling car. We just love it.
cadillac,srx,2005,rhazen541, 12/18/2006,2005 SRX V6 AWD,4,"I had an Acura TSX prior to this and compared to it, honestly I have more fun and driving experience overall in this SRX.  Granted I know I do not get the looks that I would get in my Acura, but that is a good thing to kinda blend in, in the way that the SRX performs.  I am glad I purchased the vehicle and I am looking forward to seeing the new 2007 model and contemplate on going to the V8 model.  I drove the 2006 V8 model and didn't really notice a huge difference in power, except when passing at hwy speeds is the only time noticed a bit more performance, but this is not major as I easily hit high speeds when passing in the V6 model. I hope this helps."
cadillac,srx,2005,Oso, 12/27/2006,Best Crossover Available,4,"I drove all of the competition (M3 & 5, Mazda CX-7, Acura RDX, Nissan Murano, VW Touareg, Mercedes R350, Chrysler Pacifica, Ford Freestyle) and went back to the Caddy dealer.  This is the most fun to drive large vehicle I've ever owned and this is the 30th car/truck I've had in 35 years. My Vette was more fun to drive but not worth a darn for hauling groceries and lousy in the snow.  Its fit and finish are excellent and I love the edgy styling, it doesn't look like all of the other cookie cutter, big rounded box SUV's on the road.  Drive one, you won't be disappointed."
cadillac,srx,2005,Tom Grohl, 02/28/2007,Very Reliable,5,"I have had my 2005 SRX for two years and have driven over 30,000 miles. I have only returned to the dealer for oil changes and tire rotation. This is a very reliable and pleasurable vehicle to drive. The build quality is excellent. I would recommend this car to anyone seeking a luxury crossover."
cadillac,srx,2005,Ron, 03/27/2007,Everything you need to know but....,4,"After studying the data available and test driving numerous SUVs, I bought the SRX.  And, I haven't been disappointed.  Put it through its paces on a twisty road and although not up to my C5 Vette standard it was alot of fun.  The interior is very roomy and quiet with great visibility."

I am currently getting in mixed highway and street travel 20.8 miles per gallon.  Very please compared to that of most SUV's.  Handles very well when pushed too.  Otherwise it is a very smooth highway cruiser.  Nice alternative to my old SUV!"
cadillac,srx,2005,Boinz, 05/24/2008,Outstanding SRX,4,Drove about 5 used SRX's before I selected this one.  They all drive differently - mainly suspension.

I inherited this 2005 SRX from my late uncle with only 62,000 miles in 2018. He only drove it a few thousand miles a year. He had it maintained at the dealership every 90 days whether it needed it or not. The maintenance records are with the vehicle. In one year I spent over over $7,000 in major maintenance costs including a timing chain, intake gasket, power steering pump, and new transmission.  Now 5,000 miles later at just over 67,000 it blew a rod and needs completely overhauled or a new motor.  Even with 67,000 miles and a new motor the trade in value is less than $5,000. What a disappointment from cadillac.

cadillac,srx,2006,Don C, 02/11/2018,I Love My 2006 Cadillac SRX,5,"Spoiler alert:  This is going to be a sloppy Valentine kiss to my trusty SRX.  This is the first generation SRX and it was built on a truck platform, which translates to DURABILITY.  Trucks are built to last and this is one tough-built SUV.  But for all of its ‘truck DNA’ this is a fantastic passenger vehicle for daily use and highway driving — great road car.  The interior is well laid out and super comfortable (excellent front seats).  Reliability has been terrific and maintenance is generally inexpensive, even at the Cadillac dealer.  I did have to replace the timing chains at 92,000 miles due to a supplier quality issue — at my expense.  That’s it.  Gosh, my only regret about this outstanding SUV is that it’s got 154,000 miles on the odometer now In 2018 and I know it’s getting long in the tooth.  I’m actually shopping for a newer SRX (first generation) with much lower miles.  2009 was the last year for this truck-based SRX, so hopefully there are some pampered low mileage ones stills out there.  The 2010+ models were totally redesigned using a car-based FWD chassis, so they’re smaller, lighter, and less durable.
"
cadillac,srx,2006,k_man60, 12/29/2011,This is a great car,4," I purchased our 2006 Cadillac SRX for my wife in 2009. It was a low milage unit and it was exactly what we were looking for. Aside from some normal maintenance issues we have not had any major issues with this car. The car runs well and while it doesn't get 40 MPG the fuel economy is pretty good for a V8. The SRX has a great ride and is a sporty looking unit for a family wagon. We haven't had any of the problems other posters have had. Must be the luck of the Irish. I also do my preventative maintenance (oil changes, inspections etc.).

I would buy another anytime. I drive over 80 miles a day to work and back. I now look forward to the trip. You can't beat the Bose stereo. It is almost a surreal experience."
cadillac,srx,2006,Shaunna, 11/12/2009,Great Car !!!!,4,"I bought this car a year and a half ago and the only problem Ive experienced is a dead cell in my battery which Cadillac replaced under warranty.  It handles well in bad weather and is fun to drive.  It does drink gas and oil and that could have been an issue standing for improvement. But, overall its a great car. I would purchase another. The best car Ive driven in my 13 yrs."
cadillac,srx,2006,sharimac, 06/13/2016,It's simply the best,5,"This is a SPORT UTILITY.  Mine had 69k miles and two weak cylinders when I bought it.  The engine still lasted for 3 years.  Only maintenance was the regular oil changes/tire rotation.  But I love the car so much it was well worth spending 10k for a new motor at 122k. The transmission lasted 170k.  Like with anything wear and tear things will need to be fixed and replaced.  It's easy handling, easy to park.  I'm older now and getting in and out of it is so easy even for my elderly mother.
Always having a sports car in the past it handles remarkably well.  Has real good acceleration not like a sports car, but then it isn't one.  I've hauled a 12' utility trailer with a Goldwing across country twice.  Mind you that was pushing the cars' GVW. But it did it along with 4 other round trips from Albuquerque to Jacksonville Florida.  I myself have put over 100k miles on this car and I still love it.

Returned, said ""internal error"" AKA ""we never looked!""  Replaced the radio, Same problem after new radio installed.  Returned back to dealership for 4th time when the windows were ""stuck"" half way open and no driver's side controls.  Now they are going to replace the ""unified switch body"" and they say that this IS the problem. We'll see?  Frustrated that no one seems to be able to find the problem. Anyone else have this issue?"

cadillac,srx,2006,Rick t., 10/29/2006,Great Handling! Great Ride!,4,"The more we drive this Cadillac, the more we like it. It really handles well.  I can't stress this enough.  It is a tight, nimble vehicle. Its acceleration is very acceptable for a V6.  The huge sunroof is enjoyable and we find ourselves using it almost all the time. It is easy to park and not as bulky feeling like full size SUVs. Its gas mileage has been 22-23 mpg highway and 16 around town.  We do drive fast and live in a hilly area of So Cal."

Fortunately we were able to get GM to cover the costs of replacing the motor. then i was back in again to have the entire strut assembly replaced, not long after that i went in to have wheel barings replaed (i was ok with that) then again back in to have the water pump replaced. ive only owned this car 6 months. Now i am having some issues again that the service techinicians cant seem to figure out. I had my oil changed on March 6th. On April 23rd i took my car back in do it acting weird and find out i only have 1 qt of oil in it although i had 6 qts put in it 1 1/2 months before... they have no idea what wrong now... very unhappy"

The FX was a great driver's car but had way too rough of a ride and the rear had little storage. My second car was a brand new Buick Lucerne. It drove great but, didn't fair well in the snow and rain. Also my V6 Lucerne was hard to get in and out of and was sluggish. My Cadillac SRX V6 has very comfortable seats, a functional rear gate, and is nimble and quick. You quickly forget your driving a SUV. "

cadillac,srx,2006,Becca, 10/07/2008,Poor experience with my SRX,2,"I have now owned my SRX for 1.5 years.  I purchased it brand new with no complaints up until recently.  Over the past 3 months, my car has been in for repairs 5 times with the dealer only fixing my concerns/complaints 3 occasions.  It has had a new Catalytic converter (the car stalled on me in rush hour traffic), the horn went out, the battery had to be replaced (in a year), and there is a constant rattle when I accelerate or brake.  For a ""luxury"" car, I am frustrated.  My prior vehicles that included a BMW and Mercedes did not require this much maintenance.  So much for switching to American made for me.  This will be the last GM I purchase!"
cadillac,srx,2006,mattjames24, 12/28/2010,Better than the new one,4,"Purchased as a demo fully loaded (minus the navigation system and V8) and absolutely love the car. The magnetic ride control gives the car a performance/handling on par with BMW. The moonroof is great, especially when open on the long drive home from work. The only downside was the high cost of brake work after the service department failed to notice the wear. But all in all a great car and much better than the cheap, underpowered one released 2010.

Subject: Thank you for contacting Cadillac

The help desk in Bengladesh  suggested that I spend my money to have Devoe Cadillac assess the problem. 

Understands that there are many posts online speaking to the issue of the LEMON ( my wording ) SRX and that all those owners should have spent their time and money visiting and re-visiting the dealer.

Cadillac has never thought the issue critical enough to issue a Recall !!!\

cadillac,srx,2006,Laura, 09/01/2010,Never thought I'd hate a Cadillac,4,"I bought my '06 SRX 2 months ago, and within the first week it started having electrical issues; radio presets lost memory, sunroof and windows wouldn't close, tilt reverse mirrors wouldn't work, and why it was stalling. The dealership handled the issue poorly, they've had the car for almost 25 days in the last 2 months & still couldn't fix the problem. I took it to another dealership for a 2nd opinion, and it was fixed within an hour. I guess it was a known issue for the battery and computer modules to be tighten, so that all electrical lbs of power can support all the functions. After about 3 days, all the issues came back again.

cadillac,srx,2006,Frank, 05/27/2006,Ultimate Cadillac 6cyl SUV,4,"I have driven Ford Explorers for 16 years, including 4 different models.  My dealer assumed that I would by another, but with my buying plan with MetLife, I could buy the SRX at the same price I would have paid for another Explorer.  Besides, Joe Bowman gave me a much higher trade-in than Beach Ford or Colonial Cadillac would have.  It was worth the trip to drive 250 mile to Harrisonburg to get the vehicle I wanted.  They could not have been a nicer group of people to deal with.  When I arrived, all the paper work was completed, and with an explanation of how everything worked, and test drive, I was on my way back to Vievinia Beach.  I have been excited to own another Cadillac.  I am happy."

Drives great in snow (Chicago) & rain. Handles like a dream with the two different size tires on front and back, ingenious idea. Picks up very quickly great maneuverability, awesome stereo. I tried the Porsche Cayenne, Volvo, Mdx, Lexus 300 & BMWX3,5 none compared to SRX that's why it was Car of the year 2006! Great job Cadillac! Finally it takes 87 gas, what a extra bonus esp. now!!!

We have had problems with the skyroof, it has been back to the shop 2 times thus far in addition tires can be pricy as the front and back are different sizes. We are going to get a 2008 SRX with AWD but are not concerned with the skyroof this time nor the third seat. The 3rd seat sounds great but it is hard to get to and sits to close to the rear of the car for safety reasons. We would recommend this car. "
cadillac,srx,2006,donnak48, 09/18/2011,Don't be lured by luxury!,3,"I have read many reviews regarding the SRX, nearly all of them positive. However.... I have owned my 2006 for just over 2 years now and can't even count the number of times I've had to take it to the shop for major repairs. These include the panorama sun roof not closing, the wheel bearings needing to be replaced not once but twice, check engine light coming on for reasons the shop was unable to duplicate (of course!), electrical issues causing the engine to quit and the final straw-no compression to the engine, which required a tow to the dealership, a call to GM, and more than a week's worth of repairs. I have absolutely had it with this car! $6000+ in repairs in 2 years? Not acceptable."
cadillac,srx,2006,Adrian, 01/29/2016,Maintenance costs make it not worth it.,3,"I bought this car used when it 7 years old and had 60k on it... not bad. I put ALOT of highway miles on it because my son lived 4 hours away (at the time). In the beginning it was a very smooth ride; very quiet, with power to spare. The next couple of years, however, has been full of major mechanical problems and the parts for this thing are really expensive. I would encourage anyone considering this car to reconsider and look elsewhere. The cost of oil changes alone can run from $70 to $100 a pop.

This cross-over just feels safe in all conditions, a comfort when hauling kids and on long trips. I'm a great fan of station wagons, but find the SRX to drive even better with superb luxury.

I gained in power/performance, but lost a little in handling. If America's automakers continue down the path Cadillac has paved, they'll be re-gaining some marketshare. If you're looking at the Acura MDX, Mercedes ML, Lexus GX, BMW X5 - you have to try this one too."

However, you really only feel the extra power if you accelerate while already moving (like passing) and then it flies! Off the line this vehicle sort of lumbers as it is quite heavy. Also, my SRX does feel much sturdier and less hollow than the V6, I'm not sure why. My drive to work is 40 minutes and I actually enjoy it now, it is very relaxed and has a great factory stereo... as opposed to my VERY unreliable Saab which had less than 30,000 miles!  My only complaint is that I can't seem to adjust the seat to be 100% comfortable. I think this car is just not made for women who are 5' 2""! "

I wanted something sporty and fast, my wife wanted the ideal soccer mom ride. The SRX is both, a great family hauler that feels safe and is reliable in all conditions. We love the heated seats, handling in ice and snow, traction control and stopping power. But wait, this vehicle is fast and handles extremely well, feeling like a luxury sedan and not a nicely wrapped truck. It has beautiful fit and finish, great Bose sound, and a quiet interior. I did exhaustive research before buying, comparing the SRX to the MDX and RAV4. It was no contest, and I've never owned a Cadillac before. "

The seats are very comfortable, the glass roof (s) are very large with power shades on both, the transmission smooth, great handling, good power, good brakes, good sound system, nice extra features like little gloveboxes in doors, etc.. The only somewhat negatives: gas mileage, a couple of panels not so tight on the gap tolerances, odd slight valvetrain noise...and that's about it. It's a great vehicle. V8 a must too."
cadillac,srx,2006,Gregg, 01/22/2008,Fine Performing SUV,4,My experience with this SUV has been nothing but satisfaction. I can see why it's called a crossover type. It can please on all levels. It feels and drive like a fine car and can accelerate quickly and smoothly as a sport car. Spacious inside without looking big and gaudy on the outside. The body design is sporty looking and yet refined.  I did not expect to even consider this vehicle because it was in it's second year of production but the test drive simply left the competition behind. Not only is quality built under the hood but also is pleasure and comfort. We took a 1400 roundtrip and driving fatique was never a factor!

Mine has the cashmere interior running all the way to instrument panel and top pad / dashboard.  The dashboard and instrument panel are a darker cashmere, but this is so much better than black or gray which Cadillac has forced on us over the past 10 yrs.  There is no glare on lighter dashboards.  Also, lets have some interior colors.  This is my wife""s SUV and we both love it.  It is very well built and stylish in and out.  The infared looks sharp. Only complaint is the wiper stalk on right side of steering colum sticks out too far and is easily hit when your moving hand from center stalk to the steering wheel."
cadillac,srx,2006,Carolyn CHiara, 03/01/2006,Great All Around Vehicle,4,I absolutely love the Cadillac SRX.  It performs very well in the snow.  It has great comfort and ride. I had a Cadillac Seville before this and this is far greater in style and handling.  I get a lot of compliments and questions about the vehicle from people when I am getting gas.  I had a man stop next to me at a light and give me the okay sign.  I would absolutely recomend this vehicle to others.

My salesperson was wonderful and  during bad weather of the 2006 blizzard in New York I was able to drive through areas other car could not.  I felt secure with the information from the computerized road updates and the heavy weight of the SRX.  As a women I enjoy driving it and my children love the comfort in the rear seats.

It is beautiful (inside and out), luxurious, comfortable, fast and posesses impeccable road manners. It handles like a dream.  When I drive or park the vehicle, it turns heads. On several occasions, people have actually stopped to ask me about the car. When I cite the long list of its virtues, you can tell that the questioners are deeply impressed. I cannot imagine why it took me so long to buy a Cadillac! It has been worth every penny! "
cadillac,srx,2006,Fast Eddy, 05/20/2006,Our SRX,4,"The Cadillac STX is terrific in all respects.  I love the large sunroof, the sound system and the power rear hatch.  My wife loves to drive it because of its ease of parking and incredible tight turning radius, not to mention the added height over our DeVille.  This, of course makes seeing the road and other traffic much easier.  We do believe this is a safety feature.  We feel secure with the knowlege that there are air bags in front, side, and upper side areas.  We love the low sill which makes it easy to load and unload the cargo area.  People comment about the cutting edge styling of the vehicle all the time.  The all wheel drive gives uncommon road traction which, in turn provides the SRX with exciting acceleration.  "

The exhaust is almost a growl - it is pleasant. The appearane attracts positive comments everywhere I go. Most people cannot beleive that this is a Cadillac. We are thinking of aquiring a second one - it is a very cool, satisifying vehicle. Our dealer was super as well!"
cadillac,srx,2006,Bill Foo, 07/11/2006,Nice Ride,4,"I traded in a 2004 Infiniti FX35 for a Cadillac SRX because my wife found the ride on the FX to be too harsh and the cargo space lacking. The SRX rides as one would expect a Cadillac -- very smooth and soft, yet the handling is quite acceptable. Oddly enough the FX had better gas mileage. On a round trip from Long Island, NY to Allentown, PA I achieved 18 MPG on the SRX averaging 70-80 mph. Similar conditions with the FX yielded 21 MPG. The last time I owned an American car was in 1982. I've gone foreign ever since. GM has done something nice here to win me back. Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase, but wish the acceleration to be slightly better; perhaps I should have gotten the V8."

The extra large sunroof gives it the feel of a convertible without all of the road noise.  It seems to be very tightly manufactured.  I enjoy driving it as much as my Infiniti G35!"
cadillac,srx,2006,krissyburke, 08/06/2006,I might look like a granny...but,4,"I love this car, it is so smooth. The other day we had huge amounts of stream line winds, you couldn't even feel them in this car; let alone hear them! The only problem I have is, sometimes I feel more like a granny driving this car, when all of my friends have their sporty mom vehicles. I am still only 27 and not quite ready to fully give up my youth just yet. However, with hopefully a third baby on the way this car was really the way to go for us. So, I might look like a granny in this car at times,...but I still love it!"
cadillac,srx,2006,Steven, 08/20/2006,Best Vehicle I've Ever Purchased!,5,This is my first Cadillac and it will not be my last. The vehicle is a head turner and I have received many compliments from friends and other drivers. The ultra view sunroof is a must have.  It's a fun vehicle to drive. I'm a very satisfied customer. 
cadillac,srx,2006,Jan, 02/26/2008,Class act,4,"Have enjoyed my SRX on most levels. Fun to drive, great looking, easy to handle & the look and feel of understated elegence. I have purchased it fully loaded & what a joy it has been. The SRX appeals to all the drivers in the family with only one complaint by me, fuel consumption."
cadillac,srx,2006,Robert, 11/12/2005,The Best Cadillac Ever!,5,"This is my second Cadillac and so far and it is even better than the the frst! I can truly tell that Cadillac has really worked hard to make this car what it is. When I made the hard choice to turn in my CTS to get the SRX I was reluctant, but as soon as I got it I relized I made the right decision. It handled and drove better than my CTS and it is just an overall better vehicle! "

I sold my Escalade a year ago and downsized to GMC Envoy to save money, but I missed the Caddy style and feel. I am 45 years old and this is my mid-life ""fun-to-drive SUV.""  I've got four great kids and they love it too!  It has a powerful V8 engine, great handling, and excllent options like the DVD, Navigation, and Big Sky Glass Roof."
cadillac,srx,2006,eric, 04/13/2006,Cadillac SRX,4,"I have had 6 different SUV's over the years.  For just plain fun this is the tops.  I wouldn't want to take it where I took vehicles 30 years ago, but I wouldn't do that to most luxury SUV's.  It suits me perfectly."
cadillac,srx,2006,Dana, 04/27/2006,Love My SRX,4,"After test driving both the V6 and the V8, there is no compairison for me.  The V8 is so much nicer, the noise level is quieter, and the the power is effortless.  Both my wife and I just love the styling, and we get asked all the time, ""What kind of car is it"", and I am proud to tell them that it is a Cadillac.  I have not found anyone that has not liked the looks of this car.  Keep up the good work GM, your quality is world class!"
cadillac,srx,2006,S. Ellis, 05/27/2006,SRX in East Texas,4,"After looking at the Lexus GX 470 we decided on the SRX. We added the Drivers and Luxury Packages, 3rd row seat, upgraded Bose stereo system and ultraview sunroof.  The Drivers Package has the magnetic suspension and 18"" wheels, which makes the car / SUV drive like a dream!  An added surprise was the headlight washers - a really neat feature!  We average 17 mpg (city) and 23 mpg (road).  We LOVE the automatic folding 3rd row, especially with 3 kids.  It's easy for the kids to get into from the 2nd row.  My husband and I have our own ""personal"" settings and the car automatically sets them depending upon whose key is used - no more changing the seats, radio, air, mirror, etc. - the car does it for you!"
cadillac,srx,2006,Lance Elliott, 06/22/2006,Great SRX!,4,"This is my first ever SUV/Crossover and I am very happy with the SRX. It is fun to drive, like a car, it is very comfortable and with the ultraview sunroof open and windows down it feels as if you where in a convertible or a Jeep! Having driven very flashy cars over my life time, I was worried that the SRX may not get the looks I was use to. But having bought black on black, it gets attention everwhere I go, so I highy recommend the SRX when life tells you the desire for a two seater has past, but you still do not want a boring box on wheels.............simple visit your local Cadillac dealer. I am sure you will agree the SRX will make you still feel young and sporty. It was my 36th B-day gift."
cadillac,srx,2006,Brenda and Bryan, 07/20/2006,Love my Cadillac SRX,4,"I love our 2006 Caillac SRX. Its comfortable and reliable. Its very stylish exterior is awsome. The V6 sure has a lot of get up and go when you need it. It is easy to park and handles great. There is plenty of leg room both in the front and the second row. The third seat is great, but only fits children. The thrid seat folds flat and when its down there is plenty of cargo space even for my LARGE stroller. The Ultraview is a MUST!! It is amazinly large and doesn't create a lot of noise like most sunroofs. You can't beat Cadillac's warranty! "
cadillac,srx,2006,marlin, 08/15/2006,Amazing,4,"This car is amazing, it runs very well.  It has lots of room for my family and has a huge sunroof."
cadillac,srx,2006,Formerlexusdriver, 10/02/2006,Pay More for Imports If You Must!,4,"I have read the reviews about the SRX, so I had a very low expectation for it.  All I have to say is test ride this vehicle, and all those criticisms will seem like hot air.  I read one criticism was that the center console had two levels, and that you have to remove the top layer to get to the bottom, if you don't like this feature, remove the upper tray, and it becomes one large compartment.  The handling was a very pleasant experience, and all of the controls are thoughtfully positioned.  Some people might be accustomed to European or Japanese configurations, so they may not be used to the SRX, my advice is to give some time and you will realize that there is a reason for the position of the items."
cadillac,srx,2006,john, 01/17/2007,Pleasent Suprise,5,"I spent 95% of my time looking at other cars and the final 5% looking at / researching the Cadillac SRX and wow was I surprised.  It's kind of like finding that great restaurant / hotel / vacation spot and not wanting to tell anyone about it to keep it ""exclusive."""
cadillac,srx,2006,dctex99, 03/18/2007,Brand New 2006 SRX,4,"I love everything about the SRX.  I just bought a brand new leftover 2006 model at a great price.  It handles well, gets a lot of looks, and I got a great price on it in early '07.  I highly recommend it."

cadillac,srx,2007,william andersen, 05/31/2017,My first used car,4,"Always bought new before but this 10 year old SRX looks and feels almost new. Nicest car I've ever owned: most comfortable and most features. The only disappointment is the ride - a little truck like on anything other than smooth pavement.
Now I know why I never had a Cadillac before: I can't afford the repairs.
Only about 115,000 miles on the car and the alternator had to be replaced. Also, the battery, because it ran down too low more than once as the alternator was failing. Then the transmission failed and had to be replaced. SO, now I'll have this car forever because it isn't worth how much I've put into it on repairs.
At least it gets better MPG than the van it replaced, and it's not our primary vehicle.
UPDATE; I've now had this car for 1 year and I'm really pleased with it. Such a nice, comfortsble car. And it easily tows my 3000 pound boat. I use the Tow/Haul feature because it might avoid transmission damage, but it doesn't seem necessary and it increases fuel consumption by staying in lower gears longer. MOst of my towing is less than 20 miles and mostly on flat terrain.
UPDATE: I guess it's been about 18 months that I've owned this car. Still really like it for the comfort, convenience and better MPG. No more repairs.!
"
cadillac,srx,2007,calang1, 12/30/2013,Long-term Evaluation,3,"We've owned this 2007 SRX AWD V-6 about 4-years. It now has 90K miles. The car has been very reliable, and we've only ever paid for routine maintenance. There are a few problems you should be aware of. (1) The engine consumes several qts. of oil between changes. (2) The build integrity is fair-poor, as evidenced by numerous squeaks and rattles. (3) The passenger foot-well is extremely narrow, and uncomfortable. (4) Fuel mileage is much lower than advertised. We experience 15/20. 

Update. The care was sold after experiencing a rear wheel bearing failure. The wheel bearing failure left us stranded at the side of the road with absolutely no help from the Cadillac dealership where we serviced the car. They would not even arrange a tow truck. 

The car performed as I stated, and I would not change the rating. I would caution a prospective Cadillac owner, however, to be extra-diligent in assessing your dealership experience before buying any Cadillac product.
"
cadillac,srx,2007,Caddy, 12/31/2006,Not My Father's Cadillac,4,"This is my first Cadillac.  I always thought of it as an older person's vehicle.  I have one child who plays hockey and so I felt the SRX was a great size for room and comfort on road trips.  I am only getting 15 miles to the gallon, with a V6, but so far that is the only disappointing feature."
cadillac,srx,2007,Herman, 04/23/2016,For a old car it runs pretty good me.,4,"Not that great on gas, especially city, then again I brought a Cadillac, I've had this car about month now, it had 149,999 miles on it when I purchased it, my wife thought I was crazy, but I did my homework. I ran it through AutoCheck ( 25.00 ) came up clean, NO Accidents, Title check out, Odometer was true, vehicle used, and much more came back clean 91%. Ran it through Car Facts, which show the car was completely serviced 120,000 miles, which included brakes, plugs, filters all around, rear end, and all electric components, and sunroof by the dealership. As I explain to my wife we really starting off with a 30,000 miles vehicle just without the warranty, and only paid $7,000. I will still keep you posted as time goes on, and she still keep the crazy in reserve.   
As everybody else we started off with the tires curse. Front driver tire had to have a Sensor replaced, driver rear tire had two slow leaks, had to have that fixed, and really that it so far. Will keep you posted.

cadillac,srx,2007,S.C. Good, 11/25/2006,More than just transportation,5,"I ordered the new V8 Sport SRX with 20-inch wheels and took delivery 11/15/06. This Cadillac has everything I wanted in a new vehicle: great looks; smooth, powerful acceleration; comfortable ride; and attractive, well appointed interior with many driver  convenience features. Since my car is also my part-time office, I wanted a vehicle in which I could enjoy time spent in it. Now I prefer my moving office to my stationary one!  The Cadillac SRX is much more than just transportation. "
cadillac,srx,2007,HB Gourley, 10/30/2006,First time truck owner,4,I picked up my new '07 SRX on 10/28/06 and it is a very nice ride. I ordered one with the 5.1 surround sound and DVD player. The ride is controlled and very quiet with power to spare. The 6-speed automatic transmission seems to be better on gas than my '06 XLR with same 320 horses and the five speed automatic.
cadillac,srx,2007,Steve, 01/21/2007,A Very Comfortable Drive,4,"This is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned and the visibility is great.  The interior upgrade for this year is very evident.  I'm only getting about 16 mpg but the model is the AWD version so I expect it to be less.  Early on it leaked oil due to a faulty galley plug, which was replaced under warranty.  Two rear fender well pieces became delaminated/discolored and had to be replaced under warranty, but I don't think the color (Gold Mist) was matched properly.  I'm taking it to an independent body shop for a second opinion.  If I am wrong, that will be the end of it.  If not, it will be going back to the dealership.       "
cadillac,srx,2007,Ko Venlo, 07/24/2006,Great Road Trip Car...,4,"The 2007 Cadillac SRX is a great car.  It is fun to drive, with its good acceleration and handling.  Its interior is nice for a family since it has leather on the seat areas and stronger materials on the doors.  The basic stereo is all we need and it sounds awesome."
cadillac,srx,2007,jbowen52, 01/13/2011,"Great value, great service",4,"I bought this used with 45000 miles.
 It has performed great for me.
 Smooth ride, great seats, great handling for a tall crossover and a great value.
Performance with the V6 is adequate, but it is pulling a heavy vehicle with AWD.
Have not needed more yet.
I considered the GMC Acadia and clones, but this was less than any of them with similar age and miles despite a higher initial price.
Some minor interior issues were resolved quickly by the local dealer under warranty.
Mileage runs low 20s highway, not bad with AWD at high speed and high teens around town.
Love it so far and would buy another but new one doesn't offer the third row seat, useful with the grandkids.

cadillac,srx,2007,Rogerg, 12/04/2007,Disappointed,4,Cadillac is unable to resolve a problem with hesitation when going up hills. Otherwise car handles well and is essentially a large station wagon. Gas mileage is poorer than window sticker.
cadillac,srx,2007,dme2, 01/17/2015,Stay Away,1,"Purchased this car used, as we never buy brand new. Have owned and Eacalade ESV, Mercedes M Class, Audi A4, etc prior. Never have I had a car that I hated more than this. Poor gas mileage, slow to accelerate, oil always low, panoramic roof broke twice, lost just goes on and on. Constant mechanical issues. Took to dealer a few months ago because steering gave out. Gave me a list of things wrong including the entire power steering system. Every last bit of that was shot. Unacceptable for a car with 100K on i and a car I properly maintained. These problems added up to the tune of $6,000. That was last straw. Traded it, got nothing for it, but so happy to be rid of it. Went with a Lexus RX 350 "
cadillac,srx,2007,Drrodd, 11/21/2006,My Cadillac Station Wagon,4,I have always like station wagons.  This is my first Cadillac.  My wife and I are very pleased with the product.  It is comfortable more than any wagon I have had previously.  It has plenty of spare power and handles easily.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone interested in a superior vehicle.
cadillac,srx,2007,healthguy, 12/28/2007,Great Performance.but will not repeat,4,"This car reminds me of the NY Yankees.  On paper, it just can't be beat.  On the road, and day to day there are some glaring misses.  Unless this is fixed in the next model year, I will not buy again.   Now my detail: A great handler.  Excellent solid feel of the road. Beautful look and touch. Quiet and smooth ride.  Now the problem; 1) Terrible heat and air control for back seats. 2) No button to open the hatch, you have to use the remote, and that takes practice. 3) with the rear ent system, you only get 1 cd/dvd. Just one, what's the deal with that? 4)3rd row electric seat is a death march and not simple either. Nothing like waiting 3 minutes in the rain for a seat. "
cadillac,srx,2007,DAARON, 09/26/2010,SRX,4,"Nice ride, for a short wheel base has a very smooth ride. The V6 has plenty on get up and go, but it doesn't have the power to keep it at a 70 mph run.Hardly ever is in 5th gear. If you watch the rpm you will notice an increase and still running 60 or 70 . that's why the fuel economy is so poor. I get about 21.5 hwy.But I'll pay the price for the ride and reliability"
cadillac,srx,2007,JMK, 01/08/2007,2007 SRX - One Great SUV!,4,"My wife and I just bought the 2007 SRX V8 last week.  We had been waiting until the new interior was introduced because we thought the old one looked cheap.  The new interior is absolutely FANTASTIC.  The use of hand stitched leather and real wood really makes the interior look classy.  We were in love with the exterior from day one.  This is an SUV that stands out from the rest and is very distinctively American.  We ordered the Magnetic Ride Control and this vehicle is absolutely the smoothest vehicle I have ever been in.  In addition, it corners like a sports car, is incredibly quiet, but also provides the functionality of a SUV.  I am absolutely positive that the SRX is a superior vehicle to anything in its class."
cadillac,srx,2007,bags, 04/10/2007,Awesome vehicle,4,"We traded in an '04 CTS and opted for the larger SRX. It really is an awesome vehicle. The power is strong throughout all the gears. If you didn't know it was a 6 cylinder, you would think it was an ""8"". Great ride, supportive seats  The roof is fantastic.  Quiet ride. Paint is top quality. Anyone thinking of a mid size SUV ought to give this one a look. Congrats to Cadillac.  Mileage is mediocre, 4300 pounds is the reason."
cadillac,srx,2007,Rod, 11/26/2006,A Great Station Wagon,4,"We love this vehicle and can really find nothing about which to complain.  The power is super, the ride is comfortable, it looks great.  It uses a bit more fuel than I would like but if you can afford a Cadillac you can afford the fuel.  Nothing about this car is 'cheap'.  The Bose radio and XM satellite radio are the best.  My wife and I often just turn into the garage and listen to what's playing.  My one complaint is the manual could explain some of the buttons more thoroughly.  This car is the very best anyone could want."
cadillac,srx,2007,Art Crump, 02/10/2010,Terrible In Snow,3,"Initial driving and ride were very impressive. Did a little research prior to buying, and snow driving was rated??

Since then we have replaced 1 battery, 6 tires, (all locations), 2 front wheels, a timing chain, a steering rack and a CV joint. While the servicing dealer has been great the fact remains that we still have a ""vibration"", or ""rumble"" at various speeds. Since filing lemon law papers and bringing back car for ""last chance"" repair, we are now informed that this is ""typical/usual"" to this car. They didn't say that the first 4 times car was in & they replaced wheels and tires. Otherwise we love the car!"
cadillac,srx,2007,Jeff, 01/12/2007,Cadillac hits a home run with the SRX!,4,"This vehicle is absolutely the best vehicle I have ever ridden in.  Its fit and finish quality is first class.  The interior is very classy with the hand stitched leather dashboard and the real wood accents.  The ride, comfort, quietness, handling, and acceleration are all first rate.  The exterior styling is very distinctive and American.  It has lots of storage space.  The SRX includes all the amenities that one would expect from a premium car company."

I looked at a lot of mid-sized SUV's and sedans...this is the best of both worlds.  We got the 3rd row seating because we have 5 grandkids. Even the older kids love the ""very back"" seat.  When they are not with us it folds down to a full size storage area.  The sunroof is incredible.  I will never be without OnStar or hands-free phone service.  Both are great security features.  The car's phone has worked in areas where my regular cell phone would not.  It cost more per minute..but when needed it is well worth it. It is funny to have a car with its own phone #.  "
cadillac,srx,2007,vusford1, 09/29/2007,Good crossover,3,"The Cadillac SRX is a nice crossover SUV, that is often overlooked by people shopping in this price range, who often buy the Acura MDX. I really didn't want an MDX, becuase it is considered a ""mommy- Mobile"", so I chose the SRX. I am very impressed with it so far, it has great handling, a nice ride, and a very luxurious interior. The only demerits are a couple of squeaks from the cargo area, and some occasional wind noise"
cadillac,srx,2007,B&J, 09/03/2007,Visibility,4,Run over curbs and your only clue will be the sound and the bump.

The car stopped on me twice, transmission problems and had to be towed each time.  Rear end problems twice, tire problems all of the time, and a tire gauge that never stops flashing.  When I asked about getting rid of the car I was told everything that was wrong could be fixed and nothing could be done about it.  I am afraid to go out of town in this car. Seven weeks ago (Aug. or Sept.2010)the bearings on the passenger side were replaced.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  The car is beautiful in looks but not fit to be placed in the Cadillac class. I am glad the lease is almost over.  Never again. "

We picked up a slightly used SRX4 with just under 1,600 miles for $11K under list. We also opted for the Cadillac certification so we have 5 years of $0- decuctible bumper-to-bumper warranty on it. I have already brought it in to address a couple of items like the sunroof being slow/stuck and the clock being noisy (sunroof motor and clock  replaced w/o questions). The interior is just about as luxurious as the germans, my 12 year old likes curling up in the 3rd row after tiring sports, and the V8 performs.  If it only got 25 mpg, it would be perfect."

V8 RWD sport package/black is a great looking car.   Previously had an Infiniti G35 rwd, and this car is close in perfomance, but I can tow my boats and have room in the back. Rear seat has been used for teenagers on an hour trip, and they didn't mind at all.  I love driving this car every day at the price I paid used (about 50% less than new with 28K miles).  Car is fast, will leave 2 stripes of rubber with locking rear.  Did get stuck last weekend in soft grass...AWD would have been nice, but otherwise, I don't miss it.   "

It drives great and  handles excellently when tossed through the corners.  Having driven it near it's limits at a C&D ride and drive last year left the feeling that it could be our new vehicle when our Envoy went back.  Who can beat the deal, with the great finance rates and rebates I got this one for $500 under invoice with just a phone call.  The fact that I bought from the biggest Cadillac dealer in the country might have had something to do with it.  I too am hitting mid-15 mpg area in the city, but on the highway straight cruising at 75 mph I was seeing 25-27 mpg, which is not bad for an AWD, 4,300+ lb. vehicle.  The hidden compartment above the glove box is terrific."

I looked at these for two years before finally taking the plunge with a 2007 V6 with the third row power folding seat. I wasn't sure I really wanted an SUV since I had driven a luxury sedan for years, but the transition was effortless. My husband wanted me to get the Ecalade but I felt that was just too big but the SRX is perfect!  The ride is wonderful, and I have no problem parking and turning like you can have with other large SUV's.   "
cadillac,srx,2007,Jeff, 08/24/2007,2007 SRX V8 AWD,4,"I purchased a V8 AWD with the sport package. The V6 SRX is more than adequate but for a little less gas mileage the V8 makes the SRX that much more enjoyable. Here is a first for me, after owning German, American and Japanese luxury cars, this is the first time I did not need to go back to the dealer to correct a minor or major problem. You heard right, no issues at all for the first 4 month and 4000 miles. The SRX drives extremely well, very responsive controlled ride, very fast and the six speed shifts at the right times even w/o electing to shift yourself. Workmanship and the new interior are world class. I am not easy to please but this is the best crossover out there and blows Lexus away"
cadillac,srx,2007,Lucci, 06/24/2007,SRX all I expected and more,4,"Large crossover. Handles and drives like a car, not a truck. Magnaride suspension really helps with that and is well worth the $1650. 3rd seat mostly for kids but for the rare occaisions I need it, it is perfect. It stores in the floor at the push of a button."
cadillac,srx,2007,JJJ, 10/28/2007,I just love to look at it!,4,"I love this car with a few minor exceptions. With the sport package, the 20 inch wheels, and all black outside, there are not very many better looking SUVs on the road. With the V8, it's just plain fast. But, I am only getting 13.5 MPG, less than in the Escalade I traded in.  And, the Escalade took regular gas. Seats could be a bit more comfortable but not bad."

cadillac,srx,2007,AColl, 10/06/2009,2007 SRX V6 Utility package,3,"Good looks and convienient, very useful, cargo space or 3rd seat, kids love it, too small for adults but this is a crossover anyway, not a minivan. front looks outdated, it should have been more like 07 cts, just a minor facelift could have been a tremendous benefit. Full of anoying electrical glitches, sunroof backs up when rear windoes are closing, can't be fixed, seat belt jammed and replaced twice. Don't buy this car w/o a warranty. Very good handling and performance for its size but slow compare to 2010 RSX. Electric rear seats are a slow, it should have been manual (like acura- MDX). Need better care to built and fix minor problems. Poor mileage. I would buy another one if improved."
cadillac,srx,2007,timtx01, 07/01/2008,Great experience 18mos into it,4,"I had not bought an American car since the late 1980s and was afraid to try it again. But this car was such a looker, drove so well and was priced so attractively that I couldn't turn it up. I have been very happy with the car, with the exception of the gas mileage. I do a mix of about half city/half highway driving and I manage to average 15-16 mpg. On the freeway I get 21-23 mpg depending on road/weather conditions. I think the car could probably benefit from a slightly larger wheel size but as that would only decrease MPG I am happy enough with what it came with."
cadillac,srx,2007,HMH, 01/19/2007,Fun Machine,4,"With the V8 Northstar engine, this is a fun vehicle to drive.  It has all the performance that one could ask for."
cadillac,srx,2007,Brighton, 06/18/2007,Not Worth The Money,1,"The V8 engine works well on flat straight roads. With the mountain driving I do, the 6 speed is geared too high and it continously losses powers and shifts, even in the S mode. In a 25 mile stretch of mountain driving the engine shifted 40 times in regular drive and 33 times in the ""s"" mode. Very dissappointed in the performance of this car. The back up warning is useless, the is only a audio warning when you are within 12 to 18 inches of an object and only if your reverse speed is 3 to 5 mph. Otherwise you are required to look about the back window for lights to determine if there is something behind you.  "
cadillac,srx,2007,Aleksey Toporkov, 06/23/2009,I will trade SRX when select the new car,3,"Steering wheel can not be adjusted towards driver. If you like to have steering wheel close to you and you are tall, knees will push against the dashboard and keys. Seating is rather sports car than SUV (legs will be very high). TERRIBLE leg room for the front passenger - check the narrowing on the left. Navigation system is lousy: touch screen is very non-responsive, route (pink) is colored almost the same as the other roads (red), very frustrating - trying to find something on map manually with assisting windows popping up w/o need and making the search area narrow. 3rd row seating only suits small kids. 2nd row mid seat tall passenger bumps head against switches. Resale value - disaster."
cadillac,srx,2007,Foudre, 04/27/2008,"2007 Cadillac SRX, V8",4,"We've owned Cadillacs over 30 years but this is first crossover vehicle. It is exceptionally efficient on ice and snow.  Would I buy another SRX?  Probably not. When I have passengers in the SRX there is no place for my purse except in cargo area which is very inconvenient. Mileage per gallon is poor and the small gas tank requires frequent stops to buy gasoline. Rear entry door is exceedingly slow opening and closing. Aluminum trim on heat vents on dash reflect and glare badly in both outside rear view windows, a serious problem. Lacks interior dash control for rear entry door, very inconvenient."
cadillac,srx,2007,Gary, 02/28/2007,SRX,4,"One day after we got the SRX, a snow storm hit.  The SRX got around in 6"" snow without any problems.  The vehicle is very comfortable to drive.  It has much more interior room than the CTS we traded in. Its gas mileage is not anywhere near the sticker numbers, but it is improving."
cadillac,srx,2007,Kurt, 02/26/2007,I Like My SRX,4,This is a great crossover.  We moved from a larger SUV to the SRX.  It drives like a car and still has most of the space of our  larger SUV.  It is fun to drive.

So I'm back. Got the fully loaded V8, all the toys! Rides like a dream, corners like a sports car, hauls the kids with fun. Open sky with both roofs, and AWD for the NH snow! Black on Black...head turning! I think Cadillac missed the call to market this exciting crossover. Fun to drive, quality build, upscale materials, power to spare! You'll love driving the V8. Now go out and get your Caddy SRX and take to the highway. It's a fun sporty crossover. "
cadillac,srx,2007,Charles from Canada, 04/27/2007,The best of all worlds,4,"I replaced my BMW 325xi with the SRX V8 fairly fully loaded. I wanted something fun, sporty to drive yet that would have the space for both passengers and stuff for the growing family plus that I could use for visiting business customers.  The SRX which we recently got has really blown us away on all fronts.  Outstanding interior, comfort and the driving experience for a car of this size is just a hair less dynamic than the BMW - quite amazing really. Fuel economy is so-so, but I expected that. At least it takes regular fuel so there is savings versus premium on most comparable vehicles. This vehicle has the best of all worlds - comfort, performance, fun, luxury and utility!   "

I added the 20-inch sport wheels and it looks fantastic from any angle.
Must have been pampered by the former owner as it's nearly flawless after over four years.
I wish I had the Ultraview sunroof, but it's one less thing to break in the long run.
Potential buyers beware of water leaks around the back hatch that leave water in the tire jack storage well.
It's an expensive fix (700+$), and that's if you catch it early and there's no other damage.
Other than that one problem, I love this car."

This time, I purchased instead of leasing so I drove everything, BMW, Volvo, Maxda, Acura and settled on the SRX. I couldn't be happier, the ride is beautiful, the inside ""top notch"" not like the Enclave which was my first choice after I traded the Buick Rendezvous.  Rear seat leg room better than any car I test drove.  I am 6 feet tall and the vehicle is very, very comfortable all the way around.

I hate Infinity and I can never see eye to eye with the German companies.  I decided to look at the Cadillacs. No way I was buying one, but I looked anyway. The test drive was fantastic. After much internal agonizing, I went back. There were large rebates in play and they had exactly what I was looking for. I pulled the trigger! I have never enjoyed a vehicle more. Wonderful engineering, beautiful fit and finish and a great stereo system. It has it all, size, comfort, power and a wonderful 50/50 weight distribution. Kudos to the new Cadillac management!"
cadillac,srx,2008,Steve P., 08/01/2018,The only true cross over,5,"The 2008 Cadillac SRX was built on the CTS chassis, which means it's the size of an suv with the handling of a sedan, power is great, comfort exceptional. There is a huge amount of creature comfort in that car. Road and wind noise are minimal, so long as you maintain the car it will run smoothly, it is a good solid buy.

cadillac,srx,2008,Lorenzo, 04/07/2019,"2008 SRX ""Sleeper/Keeper""",5,"Most newer SUVs have shrunk-down to 5-passenger models.  The 2005-2009 Cadillac SRXes were wonderful models......with seats for seven (7).  Then, in 2010, following other manufacturers, the SRX was also 'shrunken'.  Our 2008 SRX meets all our needs:  Seven (7) passengers (when needed), very comfortable, quiet ride, cruises on highway like on a cloud, and still looks good.  Of course, we miss 30 mpg.....but for the lower miles we drive, it's worth it!  Had our SRX mechanically checked-out, and no major issues at 73,000 miles.  Other larger SUV's (Toyotas, Hondas, etc.) may have higher resale values, but for the price we paid, we're very happy driving our 2008 Cadillac SRX.

However with only 56000 the transmission burned out all of the clutches. I had taken it to the dealer but they told me is was a computer issue. It wasn't so the out of town dealer had to completely rebuild the transmission while on vacation. Day after repair we drove it 1100 miles home without a problem. Got 22 mpg on highway at 74 mph.

So much for consumer reports saying its unreliable. Love the SRX because it handles like a well designed car and accelerates with ease. Everything works the way its supposed to and this car has been very reliable so far. Drive way better than the V6 trucks from BMW, MB and Lexus and you will save money. Test drive this car before getting saddled to a boring vanilla vehicle recommended by consumer reports. By the way this Caddy does fine off road and in the snow"

Here is the chronological order of things that broke down:
1. Handle holder on the roof (the one that you hold on to to get in and out of the car) -- was hammered in -- easy fix.
2. Front seat plastic backing was hanging -- clamp was off -- easy fix.
3. Muffler was rumbling, weird noise level up -- clamp was off -- easy fix.
4. Engine chugging -- spark plug replaced.
5. Back seats rattling wildly and violently at high speeds -- wheel balancing did not solve the problem -- still rattle.
6. Power steering and pump failed.
7.Chugging bad"
cadillac,srx,2008,RJ, 10/27/2008,Love my SRX crossover,4,I love how this SRX handles and rides.  I test drove the Lincoln MKX which did not compare to the ride of the Cadillac SRX.  I have 6500 miles and drive six (6) hours to my cottage in Michigan.  It is a treat to drive that distance now.  The interior is gorgeous and everyone always compliments the vehicle's overall appearance.  Great job Cadillac.  The Bose sound system is like nothing I have ever experienced.  I cannot wait for winter to see how it performs with the AWD feature.  It is really a fun car to drive.  My wife loves the SRX and especially the black exterior I chose.
cadillac,srx,2008,Joe, 10/12/2010,My last GM,1,"Took over the lease at 20K and had way too many trips to the dealer. 2 sets of rear breaks, 1 set of front, sunroof too many time to mention. engine light for no reason, and timing chain twice, also road noise on the highway was ridiculous.

Initially I was looking at an Escalade EXT but ended up with the SRX which I love. It handles great, looks good and is pretty comfortable. Everyone already knows the gas mileage sucks so if that is an issue this ride isn't for you.

cadillac,srx,2010,Chet in Michigan, 02/27/2018,My 1st Cadillac probably will be my last,4,"My dad had a 2000 Seville DTS, had many issues with ignition, door and window actuators etc, but she made 294000 miles when mum sold her after his passing. My mum had a 1998 Seville STS and she got rid of it after she started having issues mostly electrical and door pins falling off. So what do I do after many years later after they were all gone? I buy myself a 2010 Cadillac SRX4. So 4 days after I buy the vehicle, we have major rain storms in S.E Michigan. I come out of work to find mini swimming pools for ants and cockroaches in the passenger side and driver side floors. I was obviously devastated. Initially I thought I had left the sunroof open, but soon found that not to be the case. Having researched further on Google found 2010-2012 Cadillac SRX all 228,000 of them having the same issue. And in the state of California there is a pending class action suit against GM and owners of these vehicles for this issue. For GM does not consider it a safety issue and as such there is no recall. After numerous visits to the dealer I bought this from and threatening the lemon law (Which in Michigan is non existent on a used vehicle btw, only new vehicles, unless used vehicle came with expressed warranty at time of sale, which thankfully I had) they finally fixed the roof leak for free. See, GM was running behind in mid 2009 when they released the newly styled SRX so they used the wrong parts, and shipped out these vehicles to be sold. Over the years of road vibration later, they come lose, and the rain or any other type of water instead of going thru the drain pipes and falling on the road below vehicle, falls inside the cabin. (Also on Google) but GM does not consider a sunroof leak a safety issue so there is no recall. They however fixed the problem from the 2013-17 vehicles by redesigning the sunroof drain pipes.                                                                                                                                                    Now when winter arrives I have a new issue. Check engine light goes on. However engine runs smoothly enough. Upon using my OBD2 tester that I bought from Snapon many years ago, I find the code to be a P0017 code that comes up as 3 possible issues. Could be a lose timing chain (GM had a bad batch of timing chains for their 2009-13 vehicles) or 2 sensors. THANK GOD I TOOK OUT THE WARRANTY AT TIME OF BUYING THIS!!! So they have to fix this new issue with a $100 deductible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Overall fun vehicle to drive. In the snows this year my traction was a bit lose. Probably because the front tires are on the balder side. With a Haldex Stage 3 AWD system I should be having awesome traction. The same Haldex system used on AUDI, BMW and VOLVO vehicles.  All issues fixed she would be terrific. After all I do turn heads on that sunny day in Michigan when I roll past in my Black on Black Cadillac SRX4 3.0 Liter V6 for I am driving Cadillac Style......I think I'll try a Ford Explorer on my next venture. Thank you GM your flagship vehicle needs a lot to be a true flagship in my book.

cadillac,srx,2010,Glenn, 09/26/2010,A different story,4,"This is my second of the new restyled SRXs and my 5th new Cadillac.  I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the ride comfort as it is a bit harsh over bumps.  When compared to others in its class it is fully an equal, but I expect more from a Cadillac ride and am disappointed every time I feel the bumps and grind.  In my first (a 2010) I had the 2.8 turbo AWD because I wanted the power.  I hated the turbo lag however.  On my second (a 2011) I have the 3.0 AWD and the power is a bit lackluster but I am not planing to drive it in rally races.  It joins interstate traffic safely and performs more than acceptably around town.  I love everything else about the car and I demand a lot.  "
cadillac,srx,2010,jtsx1, 05/13/2012,"Has lots of features, but unable to give the total driving experience",3,"The exterior is looks nice, interior looks good, but drives like an old person's car. The engine lacks power; feels like there's no torque/mid-range, and fuel economy is pretty bad for this kind of performance. The brakes are some of the worst I've every used; the pedal has a wooden feel and the pads supply minimal braking...I would never dream of towing anything with this vehicle, despite it's 3500 lb suggested capability. Throttle response is horrid and could cause issue if you had to maneuver in tight spaces (there's an initial delay before the gas kicks in) I liked the gauges, center stack design, and air-conditioned front seats. I wouldn't feel safe driving this vehicle on a daily basis"
cadillac,srx,2010,BMW Car Club Member, 01/26/2010,SRX after two weeks of ownership,4,"Current vehicles: BMW 7, Porsche Boxster, Honda Odyssey, Acura TL.   I got the SRX to have an AWD, midsize SUV to replace the BMW.  Never thought I'd get the Caddy.  Rented one for 1 week to make sure I liked it.  Options are great.  Love the NAV, Weather reports, 40 gig hard drive.  Nice interior.   On the road, it feels very stable, quiet, very German.  With curves it feels like a truck.   My only wish is for more power.  The 265 hp is adequate but with such low torque, the SRX never feels that fast.  Took the car in today for a minor problem, they gave me a CTS with 3.6 L engine.  Wish they put it in the SRX.  With 3 yr lease, maybe they'll upgrade eng in time for my new one."
cadillac,srx,2010,bit0hny, 04/04/2018,Constant repairs!,2,"At 65k mile the propeller shaft (aka drive shaft) let go had that replaced. Multiple wheel bearings let go before 80k miles and the rear axle at 84k a 4k repair bill thats when I traded it for a truck made in the US. These cars are built in Mexico with cheap parts I would not recommend buying one especially the AWD. Ive had several Cadillac's over the years and the reliability has fallen short on the newer models. I suggest if you thinking about one of these you do you research most consumer reports are rating brand new models in a few days reliability is not a factor.
"
cadillac,srx,2010,Black and Gold, 10/16/2009,Cadillac Hits One Over the Wall,5,"I shopped around before selecting the SRX.  This beats the Lexus RX350 by a long shot.  This crossover is premium quality throughout.  I couldn't believe how much less this was than a comparably equipped Lexus.  The quality, comfortable ride, handling, and all the bells and whistles is hopefully some of what GM will be coming out with soon. This car has restored my confidence in GM- somebody did their homework on this crossover.  Even the gas mileage is decent- getting in the mid 20's on the road."
cadillac,srx,2010,tsenior, 12/08/2009,Hopefully a keeper.,4,"I looked at several vehicles including Highlander, Venza, Audi, Acura MDX and Acadia.  I'm still not convinced I made the best choice. Believe it or not my final choices were between the SRX and the Acadia..2 different autos, I know. I really like the space, utility and styling of the Acadia. I really liked the features and styling of the SRX. For starters the SRX ride is too stiff. I can sense the power struggle with the weight of the SRX. At cold idle the engine isn't as quiet as it should be. Seat adjustments are difficult because of the lack of space between the door and the seat...poor design. If the sunroof is open while on the freeway...excessive noise...  more than my Ford F-350."
cadillac,srx,2010,D-Lyted, 07/28/2010,What a vehicle! Pure class.,4,"We just purchased our new SRX Luxury edition and are truly delighted. Having looked at Acura, Audi and the Toyota Venza, the SRX beats them all. It uses regular gas, gets great gas mileage and rides blissfully.  If you look closely at the form, function and finish of the interior and exterior, it truly is elegant. LED lights front and rear (is that a tail fin?), 18 inch Michelins, self leveling xenon headlights, turn signal in mirrors and side marker of car, electric open rear hatch programmable to your garage height etc. WOW!"
cadillac,srx,2010,dicksc, 09/17/2010,Great SUV,5,I had a 2007 SRX and just purchased a 2010.  There is no comparison between the two.  I also had a Lexus RX 300 which was a great vehicle and the 2010 SRX is very much like the Lexus.
cadillac,srx,2010,thetvmn, 10/23/2012,Best out there,4,"I love my 2010 SRX! Not only is it a beautiful car on the outside, but the interior is amazing. The moonroofs are great for fall cruising or just riding around on a starry night. If you're a car person, you might notice that the designers didn't forget Cadillac's heritage. From the subtle ""tailfins"" to the chrome V on the dash, there's no mistaking it as anything else than the classic American automaker. And as for the bad reviews: With grammar like that, I doubt one would be educated/successful enough to own an SRX unless they bought it off a junk lot in the first place. I highly recommend this car!"
cadillac,srx,2010,stewart, 03/09/2010,Nice try,2,"This was my first Cadillac and I was excited.  Wow, that feeling has changed.  The car is way underpowered and the gas mileage is terrible.  You would expect one or the other but not both.  I love the styling but knobs have already come off and the electrical system has already been worked on by the dealer.  I originally bought this for my wife but she refuses to drive this anymore.  Oh well, it is great when you get the ""I told you so.""  In the snow it has done ok but terrible handling in the rain.  Already changed the tires once and little improvement.  I wanted to help out and buy American but I think this car needs a lot of work over.  Back to the Mercedes dealer and never again."
cadillac,srx,2010,woods2, 02/20/2011,Everything we expected and more.,5,"Bought SRX to replace our 12 year old motor-home.
Wanted vehicle for continued travels, with ample cargo space, and ability to reach 2nd home in all types weather.
Couldn't ask for a better choice.
Have 8,400 miles to date and average 26.7 mpg on road.
SRX joins
M-B 300 and Volvo C70 in our ""fleet"", and it's become our favorite ride.
Added fog lamps and greatly improve night driving on back roads.
First driving experience without spare tire/jack; keeping fingers crossed.
No negatives to date.
Power, ride, rear seat space concerns, addressed by others, found to be very acceptable in our case.
Rear seats partially recline and most comfortable.
Outstanding Dealership."
cadillac,srx,2010,ctaylor66062, 07/13/2012,REALLY disappointed with me '10 SRX!!!,3,"I've owned my Cadillac SRX for almost 2 years now. I was drawn to it's sexy looks inside and out. Since I've owned it, it has been in and out of the shop over 10 times for various issues (won't start, side view mirror shaking, chrome trim fell off, electronic issues.) I think the thing that is most annoying about the SRX is the horrible visibility. On numerous occasions I have almost hit cars/pedestrian etc because of the awful visibility front and rear. Also this crossover is extremely small compared to it's competitors. I have two kids who ride in boosters... so basically it only seats 4. No 3rd person can fit in the back row. I can't wait to trade this car in!"
cadillac,srx,2010,AE Corley, 05/22/2018,driving sadly,3,"My SRX burns oil, there is an extremly loud noise when i turn my steering wheel if it is cold out side,(so embarrassing), and we broke down about 8 hours away from home, had to replace an alternator. And the #1 and #2 buttons that adjust your seat, does not work. And my mechanic is having to keep a watch on my car because we are thinking the alternator may go out again. It was a year ago that it went out. So frustrated.

cadillac,srx,2010,Alex, 09/12/2009,Worth the wait,5,"In August, my wife and I were tempted to pounce on an Audi Q5 in order to take advantage of CARS but decided to wait for the 2010 SRX's to arrive instead.  This vehicle has been totally worth the wait! (so far)  If it were possible I would write in an 11 for ""Exterior Design"". You simply won't find better than this in the crossover class. The interior is stylish while not overdone. While the Q5 has a better navigation CPU/GPU, I find the retractable design and overall touch screen interface of the SRX to be superior.  The ride is smooth and quiet while the throttle response and steering somehow maintain a high fun-to-drive factor.  Q5? RX350? No thanks. Give me the 2010 SRX."
cadillac,srx,2010,Joe, 02/02/2010,Not real impressed,2,"I traded my 2009 Buick Enclave in on this SRX, wished I didn't. Bought Luxury model but has alot of performance options 20"" wheels. The ride is to stiff and noisy over uneven surfaces. I hear a noise like the front end is worn out when going over uneven surface like parking lots. This is not the ride I expected from all the years I wanted a Cadillac. Seat are leather and real stiff. Not enough room for me in the drivers seat and legs room, seat is all the way back too (I am 6'1""). Cadillac please go back to the drawing board with the ride, this is a CADILLAC!!!!! or it is supposed to be."
cadillac,srx,2010,Nate1431, 02/10/2010,Still Proving Itself to Me,4,"I ordered my feel w/ navigation in October 2009 and just received the SRX 3 weeks ago. I traded a 2006 Lexus RX 330 for this vehicle; the styling inside and out is what sold me as I was sick of seeing the RX everywhere I went in my town.  Acceleration is definitely lacking, but I was aware of that after my test drive, but other performance made up for it.  I am in the midwest and we have had a ton of snow and ice the last few weeks and the SRX has handled it much better than RX 330 did.  I was concerned about quality going from a Lexus to GM; my navigation touch screen already has a crack in it.  I also wish I would have gone with 20"" tires."
cadillac,srx,2010,Eyedoc164, 03/02/2010,2010 Cadillac SRX,4,"Got a 4 mos pull ahead to get out of my H3 lease.  Connecting the dots needed a GM produce, AWD with a decent lease product.  Connecting the dots, there was only one option, the SRX.  Did my hw on the web, and again all dots led to this crossover.  When US News rated it # 3 luxury midsize SUV, it wasa done deal. Dealer asked me if I wanted a test drive, saw the list of quality trucks it rated higher then, and said not necessary! With 4 lexus suv's at every red red light, the styling here is REFRESHING!.  Great style, great workmanship, great attention to detail, was concerned about the reviews that stated engine was underpowered, not an issue for me, came from a HUMMER!  Overall very pleased"
cadillac,srx,2010,PC 100, 03/15/2010,2010 SRX Cadillac AWESOME SUV gets 9.3!,4,"The 2010 SRX I purchased is the ""Luxury"" model and it has plenty of power, get up and go and is agile as anything I have ever owned in the past (BMW 535i, Acura MDX, Mercedes 300, we are a 3 car family). The fit and finish is tops, the styling is beautiful, the drive is so precise and RR Tracks don't make us rattle inside, awesome handling characteristics.  This car is loaded with so much stuff it's hard to imagine how they did it for the price.  I never thought I'd buy a Cadillac (BMW's and German engineering or Acura's and Japanese reliability where my game), but I think that they finally got it right and I feel so good about owning an American made car.  The SRX beats the competition!"
cadillac,srx,2010,Matt, 06/01/2010,Way To Go GM!,4,"I recently purchased a fully loaded Performance SRX without all-wheel for my wife and couldn't be happier, no buyer remorse here.  In fact, I've NEVER wrote a blog on any topic on the web, but felt like I had to on this one.  I currently own 3 series BMW for myself and when my wife needed to get a car I had to take a look at this car since it was the styling that first caught my attention.  However, what I found was that I was blown away by the comfort of the ride and all of the features the car has.  It truly is a well thought out car.  Happy to say my wife loves it too.  Funny thing is that when i go to the garage I find myself pausing for a good minute before I decide which keys to grab."

As far as power goes its nore then i need, and for a 4000 pound car it moves along nicely. The ride is good for an suv/crossover. City mileage is not the greatest i am getting 15.5 mpg how ever i am getting at best on 3 long trips 28 mpg each trip, thats on the on board computer and by doing the math and keeping under 70 mph. I have had one body problem and that was the small piece on chrome molding on the drivers mirror fell off, (caddy dealer replaced it free). All in all i love the car, it's a head turner!"

I don't recommend any one purchase this crossover we paid over 40,000 for this car and this is what we got put a little more money and go get a BMW or a Mercedes because its not worth the headache."

The BOSE sound system is tremendous and the sportiness keeps it young. :D
It rides super smooth and I've never had a complaint about comfort. 
The price is outstanding for what all it has to offer and I'm honestly in shock at how convenient this car is. 
It's roomy, sporty, beautiful, and smooth... What more could you ask for?"
cadillac,srx,2010,J, 01/02/2010,Great decision...!,4,"07'BMW X3 to 10'SRX. We too looked at Q5, GLK, MKX, RX. SRX has more content and offers more value. Fit and finish very good. Power is adequate for this type of vehicle. We have done a 1500M road trip and it was great. Around town it is perfectly fine..! Interior is really nice and better than all the others. You get more VALUE with Cadillac. All the others are ala-carte and add up too quickly. Cadillac targeted LEXUS and quite frankly it is no contest, the two don't compare. The SRX is hands down a better product overall. We really like our white/grey/chrome wheel, performance version, it was a great decision indeed. It's my ladies crossover and she is very happy. Wow..we have a Cadillac !"
cadillac,srx,2010,mstiltner, 10/03/2011,Love it!,3,"I've had my 2010 for a few months now and I am pleased overall. It is a little weak. I should have gone with a more powerful version since I'm used to a V8. I love the size I don't feel too big or too small. I am dissappointed because I keep having to take it to the dealer..... sunroof issue, memory seat problem and remote start problem. Not what I would expect from Cadillac. Even after all of this I still love this vehicle."

cadillac,srx,2010,sparky5858, 11/21/2009,Extensive test drive only,3,"We have a 2007 SRX about to end lease, and we took on of these for a test drive. Though we like the exterior styling and sunroof (both trump the rx 350), that's pretty much where it ends. The first thing the driver is presented with is a very clunky and archaic steering wheel adjustment mechanism. Even though our 2007 has mechanical tilt, at least there's actually some pivot. Not here. Very cheap feel. What is Caddy thinking? Drove it back to back with the GMC Terrain. Very similar feel for more than $10,000 more. Also, very sluggish and the ride quality was not that good. We actually thought the Terrain had a better ride. Caddy missed here. We'll keep shopping, but leaning toward RX 350."
cadillac,srx,2010,Brian, 11/25/2009,A near hit.,3,"Although this model looks better than the previous generation, I still like the BMW styling more. The sharp lines in the hatch don't look good on this type of car. This car is way overpriced and can't compete with Lexus, Infiniti, Acura when the only engine option is a whimpy 3.0 V6. Why did they take out the V8? Also, the way the windows slope down in the two rear windows looks dumb and takes away blind spot visibility. My Pacifica has a bigger engine, more interior room, but gets the same fuel economy. Buy a Ford Edge and you'll get a car with better resale value for $10k less."
cadillac,srx,2010,handysandy, 12/23/2009,What a poor design,3,I drove the SRX around my dealer's streets and thought it was somewhat underpowered but acceptable. Now that I have had it for a month I am sorry I did not take the GM return option. This car is underpowered and has the poorest ride I have ever experienced. A few comments have noted that the ride of this car is horrible. I would add that I have never had a Cadillac with such a bone jarring ride ( I have had six of them before this one) My wife and I need our seats back almost all the way. There is no way to put the back seats down to form a cargo area with front seats back.Dealer says ride and cargo problems are design. Don't buy this expensive dog!! 
cadillac,srx,2010,Ryan, 01/12/2010,This is no Cadillac! Keep your old SRX,3,"This is NOT a Cadillac, this is a ""luxury version"" of a Chevy Equinox, a small eco-SUV. Nowhere near as comfortable, useful, or fun to drive as our 2004 SRX (which is a TRUE Cadillac-designed vehicle). We were excited when we heard about the upcoming redesigned SRX for 2010, but now regret waiting. Going to get a low- mile or unsold 2009 SRX instead."
cadillac,srx,2010,V Owner, 02/07/2010,Luxury SUV,4,"Purchased this car despite auto magazine reviews. Test drove many luxury suvs. Best most comfortable  interior I have ever owned. Power is more than adequate especially with sport mode. Outstanding long range tourer, very comfortable, very luxurious. Not a performance car but has adequate acceleration. For performance sedan purchase performance car like a CTSV or 5 series.

No, 5 days later the parts still not in. finally they fixed it. 4 months later the car is dead when I get in it. Call Cadillac road side asst. they tow the car to dealer. I mention that the car hums when  the car is turned off and you're in it. 2nd that the rear end is making a noise after backing up and slowing turn the wheels - surround sound does not work. they rent a car. I will  have this rental 7 day's very unhappy with the issues on the rear differential. the car is less then 5 month's old. I LOVE the dealership. Never buy Again."

cadillac,srx,2010,T-Bay, 08/03/2010,Great Luxury for the price,4,During my test drive I fell in love with the car. I didn't use the sport mode until I got it home. This has eliminated any concerns I had about pick up and the ability to pass on the highway. I bought the luxury model without the nav system.  Onstar downloads turn by turn navigation directly to the small screen on the steering wheel. It also comes over your stereo system prior to a turn.  Brilliant!  The pop up and rear view camera are nice but I am glad I saved the $2400. It also comes with rear and front parking assist without the camera and pop up.  The interior is incredible and really makes the driving experience a dream.  Great value for a luxury crossover!

Where I live this could have a very grave consequence. "
cadillac,srx,2010,Car Crazy, 11/20/2009,Almost Perfect,5,"At 22 years old and spending all my money on the vehicles i drive, and after owning a fully loaded lincoln aviator for the last 4 years i can say this is what a luxury suv should be.  The motor is a little underpowered so i out in an intake and a turbo.  Now i can fly by anybody else on the road.  The fit and finish are perfect, the road noise doesnt exist, adn its smooth. I average 28/29 mpg and i drive hard.  Ive only had the Caddy for a month, put on 9000 miles but its still like the day i drove it off the lot.  My only recommendation for Caddy would be to get rid of the 3 litre and use the 3.6 from the cts, and make the 2.8 the base engine."
cadillac,srx,2010,Ron, 07/13/2020,Great luxury SUV,4,"Bought mine used with about 129k miles on it a few years ago, now have about 149k. It is very comfortable, quiet and 10 speaker sound system w/sub is as good as my home stereo. Also gets good gas mileage, perfect travel car. I have had a few repairs, nothing major, but that is to be expected with a 10 year old car. Some people expect cars to last forever, but everything needs maintenance occasionally. All in all, been the perfect SUV for me.

cadillac,srx,2010,BigWes, 09/20/2009,This Cadillac Delivers,5,"I rented 2010 SRX first to make sure I liked the car's offerings, and it won me over hands down.  It is a bonifide Cadillac in every aspect. From the front grille to the tail lights it screams loud that it is GM's best.  Smooth ride, solid handling, quality appointments and surperb brakes.  I read a couple of reviews suggested a bigger engine was needed.  I find the base 3.0 V6 quite sufficient for the task.  It's responsive to throttle input and EPA mileage rating seems to be true.  I LOVE this car and it was worth the wait for them to hit dealer showrooms. Keep making cars like this GM and you will regain the #1 auto maker spot soon."
cadillac,srx,2010,John, 09/28/2009,The Best Looking Crossover World Class,5,"I love my new SRX. After checking out the Lexus RX350,Audi Q5 and the Mercedes GLK. I went with the Cadillac the navigation is the easiest and most advanced of all the ride and comfort fit and finish is world class and the design is artistic and seperates itself from the cookie cutter styles of its competition. Check out the Cadillac SRX you will also love the fact it is about $3000-$4000 less than other crossovers option for option"
cadillac,srx,2010,Birce Ege, 09/25/2009,Just like in the commercials,4,"Just picked up a Gold Mist with Shale interior yesterday. The design is really amazing, once i got in i felt like i was in an airplane cockpit. Spacious, comfy, luxury, all the switches ergonomically designed. Test drove a Lexus RX350 before and besides the fact that the SRX engine is slightly louder, i'd pick SRX hands down. Pick up not as bulky as i thought, panoramic sunroof makes the interior very bright when you uncover it. I thought i'd never pay for a navigation package in my life but i would highly recommend you opt for it, beautiful big screen, easy to use, touch screen. Leather trim is top notch, all the details nicely done. 265hp is enough despite reviews recommending the turbo."
cadillac,srx,2010,Tiffany, 10/09/2009,Bang for your buck,4,"Have had my SRX for about a week, such a smooth ride feels like I'm flying. Engine is powerful enough, especially since it handles more like an SUV than a car. Test drove the Lexus 350-boring and expensive compared to the SRX. One problem, the tire lug-bolt cover popped off somehow and I've already had to get it replaced. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase."
cadillac,srx,2010,mejs2, 10/12/2009,Just NICE,4,I was considering buying the chev traverse but thought it was too big. Once my wife and I saw and drove the SRX we were sold.  The ride is cadillac all the way.  Traded in a CTS that was nice but this is much better.
cadillac,srx,2010,charlie, 10/12/2009,A Gtreat New Design,5,"I waited about a year for the new design to come out on the SRX and it was well worth the wait. The new design competes well with other SUV's of this price range. I think this is the SUV for those of us who want the luxury of an Escalade, but don't really need to drive a behemouth. The SRX is everything I expected and waited for and more....."
cadillac,srx,2010,Charlie, 10/13/2009,Drive it for Yourself; then Decide,4,"If I would have listened to certain car magazines I would have never looked at this vehicle. They said that it was drastically under powered. On the contrary this vehicle, although not a speed demon, has plenty of power and rides like a dream. The build quality is excellent and it doesn't follow the crowd with it's styling. Every day I have someone come up to me saying that they love the style of my car. Great choice."
cadillac,srx,2010,Barry, 10/17/2009,Way To Go GM!,4,Now this is what a high quality SUV should be like.Quality for a great price!These are selling off the lots faster then pancakes @ ihop! Be real happy if you get one for MSRP?
cadillac,srx,2010,Lawrence, 10/23/2009,Cadillac SRX - at the top with no second,5,This vehicle exceeds anything I can imagine.  The quality of the vehicle and the interior - everything to a tee.. never thought a V6 would deliver quick driving and quiet at the same time - gas mileage is out of the chute at an average of 25 mpg with limited downtown driving. The style steps over any other.. in a class by itself.  Lot of room and cozy interior.  Love it !!
cadillac,srx,2010,Barry, 10/25/2009,GM Gets It Right!,5,"Don't want a car, Don't want a truck, this crossover is for you!Looks great inside & out.Handles flawlessly even with it's 265 HP.My SRX is loaded with rear DVD & chrome wheels.You get a lot for the $ & big savings from competitors.Take one for a ride, you'll love it!"
cadillac,srx,2010,American Musashi, 10/28/2009,2010 Cadillac SRX,4,"I recently purchased a new 2010 SRX. It is sporty yet very comfortable. Its styling is superior to that of the Lexus, Acura, Mercedes and some BMW crossovers (the new X6 is super cool but super small). I was in the market for a vehicle that offered me the best value for my dollar and I found it with this outstanding machine. My SRX is a premium and as a result has an impressive list of amenities. It has sporty handling when I need it and is quiet and comfortable on my daily commute. I have to say that I am a convert and am impressed with the overall quality of the material and workmanship."
cadillac,srx,2010,Sjones, 10/29/2009,SRX matches up well,4,"Drove the SRX with 20"" wheels and most other options at manufacturer event. GLK, X5 and RX350 were on hand for comparison. The SRX interior was the best hands down. The GLK was dull and the RX350's design is just odd. The simple touch screen nav is easier to use that the Lexus mouse controller. The 3L engine did not feel slow although it was noticeably slower than the Lexus with its 3.5L V6. That said, the SRX felt much more buttoned down than the Lexus and on par with the GLK. The backseat offered vents with climate control which the Lexus lacks. Also, the door panels were of superior quality to the Lexus. Did not sample X5 because it was so much more expensive than the others."
cadillac,srx,2010,SeeMeFly, 10/29/2009,The Best Crossover Ever,4,"After attempting to purchase a 2010 RX350 and not getting a deal in the Houston area, I waited for the 2010 SRX release.  Best wait ever and best car ever owned.  Hands down over my Mercedes C280 purchased new in 1998.  With cars like this GM will be back on top soon!  A joy to drive and love the Nav and XM radio.  Was able to get a spare tire from dealer, although they don't come with car.  "
cadillac,srx,2010,Bill, 10/29/2009,Ex X5 Ownwer,5,My family and I love the car.  It is  a pleasure to drive and a headturner.
cadillac,srx,2010,Steve Tait, 11/07/2009,Absolutely Delighted,4,"After a long wait for delivery, I am absolutely delighted with this vehicle.  The interior is fantastic and the exterior design grabs much attention.  Prior vehicle was 2006 SRX and the 2010 is a big step forward, particularly in interior comfort, features and design.  Some reviews said the car was underpowered and I do not find that at all.  There is plenty of power and the vehicle moves quite quickly.  First and second gears are a bit noisy though and then third through sixth gears are quite quiet.  A great highway cruiser.  Altogether a great value, way better priced than the competition.  Cadillac should sell a ton of them."
cadillac,srx,2010,manx2, 11/11/2009,can't do much better!!,4,Absolutely love it! Lucky to get one off the lot; great price; enjoying every minute of driving!
cadillac,srx,2010,HoustonTexan, 11/15/2009,American Luxury at it's finest,5,"I feel like I am in an oasis of comfort, style and agility. This car is all that it is cracked up to be and more. You get more than your money's worth. My neighbor next door drove home a bmw 5 series coupe (sporty), my neighbor across the street drove home a mazda 6(affordable)all brand new this weekend and I drove home the SRX handsdown (priceless)"
cadillac,srx,2010,HBG, 11/20/2009,Very nice ride,4,"Picked up my 2010 in late October. Already have a 09 SRX, but the 1010 and just a little nicer on all levels.Build quality, fun to drive, interior, exterior all a 10. The SRX stand out from the crowd. If your thinking about a SUV put this at the top of your list and take it for a ride.Very nice ride."
cadillac,srx,2010,lyndy, 12/02/2009,OMG! So cool!,4,"I absolutely love my new SRX! The styling looks great,  the performance - Serious head turner!"
cadillac,srx,2010,Scotty, 11/25/2009,2010 SRX - I love it!!!,4,I saw the commercial for this car and they had me.   I had been looking at a variety of cross overs but felt they lacked style.   I will say that this car turns heads.  I've received a ton of compliments on it already.  I love the exterior design.  I just picked it up last week and I will say that I love it!!!
cadillac,srx,2010,GoldMist , 11/25/2009,Noise?,4,Bought my premium SRX in October. Absolutely love it. Except for ONE THING - Does anyone hear an odd noise coming from behind the center console? I've been told this noise is in all SRX's. Dealership said it was probably the navigation cooling fan? Seems odd to me...
cadillac,srx,2010,Lon Nefouse, 12/04/2009,The 2010 SRX,4,"First American I've bought in many years..this is such a great car and a crossover,,has all the bells and whistles without the complications. I love this vehicle. Its what Cadillac was once all about. when the phrased was used for something that was top of the line ""THE CADILLAC OF THE INDUSTRY"". KUDOS TO GM..they got this baby right..and 50K bumper to Bumper for 4 years 100K powertrain. I'm BACK!!!"
cadillac,srx,2010,Cady Happy, 01/01/2010,1st Happy Cady Owner,4,"Read much about the lack of pick-up in t enew SRX.  My suspencions are these are previous V-8 owners (massive SUVs).  The car is great, corners great (beats our Pilot), interior is well designed and the CRV is such a joy to drive.  So much technology, still learning after 1100 miles.  By the way, stomp on the gas and the SRX does take off without hesitation.  It's a CRV not a Vette!"
cadillac,srx,2010,Dick Anthony, 01/08/2010,Stiff Ride,4,"We test drove a basic model,front wheel drive with 18"" wheels and purposely drove over bad roads. The ride was excellent. However we wanted and purchased the Premium model with all the options. The first drive in it I knew we made a mistake because of the handling. It is to stiff and noisy over uneven surfaces, nothing like the model we test drove. I inquired when ordering the car if we could get it without the sport suspension and 20"" wheels, but you could not. But I thought ""oh this a Cadillac, it must ride nice"". Mistake!! All the other features of it are excellent. Warning, test drive the actual model you will be buying."
cadillac,srx,2010,red white, 01/21/2010,fun to drive,4,"I really enjoy driving this car as I don't personally feel like I need gobs of horsepower or torque because as I mature (older) I tend to put less emphasis on performance as opposed to comfort, reliability, and upscale features. If you purchase the srx with the standard 3.0 liter engine it's important to remember that performance is not what you will get. I was pleased with the way the car handled (we travelled to Florida 1585 miles) and the fact that I wasn't the least bit fatigued after driving for 27 hours with on nights rest. Visibility not as overly compromised as some reviewers have said it was, as I found it easy to adjust to because of the large exterior mirrors"
cadillac,srx,2010,Annette, 01/19/2010,"Not much power, you're paying for luxury",4,"This review is based on a rental for two weeks while my Mitsubishi was in the body shop.  The bottom line is that you are paying for the ""toys"" in this vehicle rather than performance.  I expected a vehicle priced this high should have some pep when it comes to the gas pedal.  It's pretty sluggish when it comes to shifting.  In automatic mode, it was revving at 4500 rpms before it shifted into 3rd gear.  You are basically paying for the goodies & gadgets inside the vehicle.  Is it really worth it or would you rather have good performance?"
cadillac,srx,2010,jeff s, 02/02/2010,Replaced a GLK 350,4,"My wife recently purchased a MB GLK350 and found it too small, as I did. Replaced it with the SRX-AWD....much roomier and frankly more comfortable overall. Though this is our first american name tag in two decades, it is surprisingly satisfying.  Only drive in about 1,000 miles. So far so good.  "
cadillac,srx,2010,Scott, 02/05/2010,Initial impressions,4,"Have only had the car now for about a week. Less than 500 miles on it so far but so far so good. Just got a hitch put on it and the all weather floor mats and mudflaps. Turbo definitely gives it a bit more pep - but you should definitely drive for yourself to decide if the premium (and drop in gas mileage) is worth it.  One gotcha that I have not seen mentioned is that the Turbo requires premium while the 3.0L engine can run on regular.  Compared it with XC-60, RX350 - and decided on this for features and drive."
cadillac,srx,2010,D. Johnson, 01/28/2010,"so far, so good",4," This vehicle caught our eye in October of last year. It's exterior made a statement that we liked. The interior hit the spot,too...A lot of creature comforts there. Prior to purchase,we searched for reviews, giving more weight to people who actually *bought* the vehicle.  Some who bought the Performance SRX said the ride (on 20-inch wheels)was too stiff and they wish they'd purchased the Luxury with the 18-inch wheels. We decided the Luxury SRX met our needs. We like the ride,feel and handling. It's too soon to rank it's reliability...I'll have to get back to you on that. "
cadillac,srx,2010,rk4racing, 01/30/2010,2010 SRX,4,"At 1700 miles, still loving my SRX.  We test drove the Terrian, but picked the SRX due to standard features on the SRX that are not available on Terrian.  A great value for the price, plus the latest Caddy technology.  The digital display is very cool.  My in- laws who have 07 Escalade were giddy over features.  The drive and handling is fun and sporty.  Love the styling, the SRX stands out amongst the mass of curved crossovers, a headturner amongst the mass Lexus' in So. Cal."
cadillac,srx,2010,Andrew, 02/09/2010,Smooth Crossover,4,"I have owed my SRX now for two weeks, and I am very impressed.  I feel it's the best priced luxury crossover avail.  I looked at the Q5 and MKX, and the SRX beat them on price by thousands with the options in the Luxury package.  $37.7K MSRP with a bose system, moonroof, bluetooth, XM, push button ignition, power liftgate, remote start, and very well designed interior.  After incentives I paid less than $35K, when a similarly equipped Q5 would have ran well over $45K required prem gas to get 12% worse highway MPG.  The MKX would have been at least a $3.5K higher and the push button ignition is not an option not to mention the feel of the interior of the Cadillac vs the MKX. No comparison.   "
cadillac,srx,2010,KEC 11, 02/10/2010,Love my SRX,5,It's great! No problems so far after 2 months. Especially like the platinum ice white color.
cadillac,srx,2010,Hope Hill, 02/18/2010,I Love it;-),5,I traded my 2004 SRX for the 2010 SRX. My! What a difference! They improved everything. It doesn't even look like the same car. I love the in your face grill. It says look at me! My SRX is black with black interior. It's so sleek. Can't wait to take it on vacation!
cadillac,srx,2010,KY Woman, 03/01/2010,Love it so far!,4,"The styling of this vehicle is amazing.  There are SO many boring cars out there.  This crossover turned my head from the moment I first saw it.  I just love it. I had to rate reliability in order to submit my review, but my opinion after only 1 month of ownership isn't very informative."
cadillac,srx,2010,Dave583, 03/13/2010,Cool Caddy SRX,4,"My new SRX has to be one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.  Super sleek and fun to drive.  Very quiet ride under normal conditions and very comfortable too.  Love all the bells and whistles and that super cool pop up Nav / systems screen.  I have the AWD Performance package and it drives well in the snow. I test drove 3 different models and liked the Performance one the best. Yeah, its not the fastest or quickest out of the gate, but boy all the rest of the features and the LOOKS more then offset that. After all, its an SUV not a race car and I have not had any problems merging onto the highway.  I just need more free time so I can drive it!"
cadillac,srx,2010,ky cadillac, 03/12/2010,first cadillac,5,"First time owner of Cadillac and could not be more happy with SRX. Fun to drive, looks great, lots of convenient accessories. Just about every day get some type of compliment on it from other folks. "
cadillac,srx,2010,Mini Fins Fan, 03/03/2010,"Like it, but..........Yeah we like it !",4,"The fit and finish are great, with one exception. The driver's outside mirror is loose. Otherwise everthing is fine. Checked out Lexus RX and BMW X5. Bang for your buck has to go to Cadillac. This car is great, ride is a little stiff, but it pays off whenever you want to enjoy some spirited driving. Test drove the 3.0 and to be honest, it was verrrry poky. Waited and test drove the 2.8 turbo. What a difference. Like night and day. Unfortunately, it uses only premium fuel. I thought that maybe I could sneak in some regular now and again, but that is not the (recommended at least) case. The interior is fantastic and the Cadillac exterior design is unmistakably attention grabbing.  "
cadillac,srx,2010,JJ Poire, 04/03/2010,Actually Better Than Expected,4,"I'm a buyer's remorse kinda guy, so I expected all kinds of things to bug me once I drove the car away. Not so. The car is fun to drive,especially in sport mode, the interior almost perfect, the comfort unmatched and I really don't know what all the underpowered talk is about but it gets on the freeway great and cruises impeccably.Seriously, of all the new cars I've owned this one scores the highest since the first year model Ford Explorer, and it's a LOT better on gas."
cadillac,srx,2010,roundhill, 04/20/2010,Excellent car horrific visibility,4,"Fun car to drive. I get a lot of compliments & jokes either asking why a Caddy (because I am not over 60) & where are my spinning wheels (SRX is black; very urban looking). The interior fit is excellent; controls easy to use & the nav & onstar are excellent.  Upgraded from a minivan so big change! Rear storage is limited (especially when compared to a minivan). Biggest complaint is the visibility. I am 6'1"" & I have several blind spots. The rear view camera helps.  Went with FWD to save some $. Some say & I agree that the on the highway acceleration is weak for a car in this class; the V6 is too small but you get better gas mileage; a trade off. Well priced. Has a decent warranty. No spare."
cadillac,srx,2010,Jerry Serimian, 04/21/2010,So Happy-So Sad,4,"After previously owning a 2008 Cadillac STS with the 4.6 liter, I have to say that the 3.0 liter engine performs extremely well given the size and weight of the SRX. Ride and quality are second to none.  At this price point, the SRX offers more amenities than many other sport utilities in the same price range."
cadillac,srx,2010,frank, 04/21/2010,cts on stilts,4,So far so good car has cts interior but is up higher better ground clearance in bad weather<<real sporty love interior pop of nav sunroof love the car. I don't usually buy a car first of a new design so I leased it cadilac outdid themselves! Got all wheel drive with nav makes the most sense in the northeast will also help resale value
cadillac,srx,2010,UH Keller, 04/22/2010,I would have never believed it,4,"Our SRX replaces a Honda Pilot.  Our other car is a 5 series BMW.  We love the SRX.  Style, comfort, handling and surprisingly great quality control. We prefer the SRX over the BMW on long trips.  Fuel consumption has yet to reach advertised rate, but we only have driven it for 3000 miles. My wife loves her car."

cadillac,srx,2010,JM Hammond, 05/18/2010,Just what I expected,4,"For the past 3 years I've been driving a Jeep Compass. Probably the worst car I ever owned as an adult. I've had several Cadillac's. This is not only the most stylish, but the best in comfort and handling. The ride is exceptional. The navigation system superb. The CD loader outstanding. The adjustable rear gate a brilliant idea. GM has a winner here and I'm glad to be back in the fold.    "
cadillac,srx,2010,Barb, 05/24/2010,My first Cadillac,4,"I purchased my new Cadillac SRX 4 weeks ago. What a fun and exciting vehicle to drive! It is quite responsive, (I love the sport mode) it handles like a sports car when you drive it like one! The seats are so comfortable, beautiful stitching along the seats, great stereo system, huge sunroof, very, very quiet inside. Low to the ground styling, very sporty looking! I love those Xenon headlights and LED taillights! The push button  start/stop is a cool feature. The adjustable rear hatch door is awesome! The gas mileage is impressive and I expect I will hit that 25 mpg on the open road.  Cadillac has done an outstanding job on this new addition to the line up. I give it 5 Star rating in my book!"
cadillac,srx,2010,Barb D., 06/09/2010,My First Cadillac,5,"I purchased a 2010 SRX Luxury Edition. I am a devoted GM & GMC fan and this one tops all of my past purchases! So far I love everything about it! The style is awesome, handling is very sporty, comfort is over the top, attention to detail on the interior is very impressive!  The stitching on the seats, dash and door panels really show that added bit of luxury from Cadillac. It is such a quiet and smooth ride! No lean or pitch on curves, very tight and confident feel about the sporty way it handles! The huge sunroof is so unique! All components are with in easy reach of the driver. And, .as though it couldn't get any better, I am getting 24.7 mpg on the highway! Cadillac has ROCKED MY WORLD!"
cadillac,srx,2010,John, 06/16/2010,2010 SRX - it's nice!,5,"This is my first Cadillac and I'm really impressed so far!  I've had the car less than a month but I just love driving it.  It rides like it's on a cloud! The handling is great and the performance is not as bad as everyone was eluding to.  Everyday I learn something new about the car and say to myself ""that's really cool"". Had the car on a trip recently and the navigation system was outstanding, then add real-time traffic and OnStar and you have a winning combination. The 3 climate zones, rear audio system (it's like having 2 radios - must use headphones) made things very comfortable for everyone.  GM did an outstanding job in my opinion - plus the car is NOT outrageously priced!"
cadillac,srx,2010,MommyO, 06/23/2010,I'm in Love,5,"I have been considering downsizing from my Ford Expedition for a year now, spending numerous hours on-line researching different makes and models. Last month my  husband and I finally started test driving. I liked the Lexus RX and the Chevy Equinox, until I fell in love with the Cadillac SRX. The vehicle is amazing, it's all that and then some. I have it in the Platinum Ice Tricoat color and I have received nothing but compliments on it. I bought it with 2,600 miles on it and the price dropped almost $10,000, which didn't bother me because it's in MINT condition. I hate buying brand new; as soon as you drive it off the lost the value on it drops drastically."
cadillac,srx,2010,Barbie Doll, 09/03/2010,Amazing first Cadillac,5,As a recent college graduate I was looking for a vehicle that was appealing good on gas mileage and overall was comfortable. I am beyond happy with my SRX. I love the quality of the navigation system and how easy it is to use. All my co-workers are in love with the sunroof and how big it is. I must say I'm always volunteered to do the driving at works since my car is so comfortable. I will say I was a bit skeptic at first going from a two door sports car to a cross over but I must say I am beyond happy. The only problem I have encountered with the vehicle is one of the aluminum pieces by the driver mirror fell off. I took it to the dealership and it seems a few people have had the same issue.
cadillac,srx,2010,pghguy517, 10/26/2010,Nice car,4,"I love the car!  Looks and rides great, well built.  The dealership that I bought it from was the only disappointment.  No experience with their repair shop, but their sales staff was the worst.  The Lincoln dealer staff next door was much better."
cadillac,srx,2010,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,Almost Perfect,5,"I wanted a small SUV that got decent gas mileage but didn't want to go with a rear wheel drive model for the few days a year that it actally snows in Washington, DC.  That narrowed my search down to the SRX and the Lexus.  I bought the SRX luxury edition without any extra bells and whistles.  I love the car.  It rides like its on rails and has all of the features that I need.  Even though its more sport than utility, I can still fit quite a bit of stuff in it.  Given that the car costs +/- $5K less than any other car in its class, I think its a great bargain.  "
cadillac,srx,2010,Valerie Apa, 11/20/2016,love Cadillac,5,"Went from a CTS To the SRX because we needed more room and wanted to pull a small camper.  We are just as impressed with this SRX As we were with our CTS. Love the glass roof and the comfortable ride!

cadillac,srx,2010,J BYRD, 04/22/2017,It's a Cadillac!,4,"I've had the 2010 Cadillac Luxury, Premium turbo and now own the Performance model.  The Luxury was front wheel drive and I wanted the AWD with all the features, so I got the Premium model with the 2.8 turbo.  It was great with nice acceleration and all the features...fully loaded with entertainment package.  I then saw the Performance model with all the same features except the 2.8 turbo and econo mode; however, I liked it better because it uses regular gas, not like the turbo, which requires premium gas.

Then when weather was really hot the fan that cools the motor wouldn’t turn off. We had to pull the fuse out to get it to stop. Then both rear wheel bearings had to be replaced. The back up camera went out at $50,000 cost $799. Took to the dealership today. The radio has quit. They said it needed an amplifier. This caused the back up sensors to quit working also. Today also the transmission starting slipping  I’ll never own another Cadillac. This has taught me a lesson.

cadillac,srx,2011,CaddyLove, 08/08/2015,Love this Caddy!,5,"I've owned my 2011 SRX Luxury since May 2011.  Regretfully, I will be selling it soon.  I have loved this crossover and have never had any issues.  Aside from a few minor recalls, this vehicle has been virtually maintenance-free!  I have to admit that after 4.5 years I have racked up a meager 33,000 miles (mostly city driving), but have had the opportunity to take it for a couple of long road trips.  Except for sluggish acceleration, it drives like a dream.  I have the pop-up Nav screen and the sound system is awesome!  The interior is beautiful and the ambient lighting (at night) is a nice touch.  The seats are comfortable and the ride is very smooth.
My major complaint is the lack of room in the back seats. We have a massive car seat for my son, which only works in the middle of the backseat.  With another on the way, it has come time to get a larger vehicle.  If it weren't for needing more room, I'd drive this until the wheels fell off, which I'm sure would be a very long time from now at the rate we're going!
One thing I think could be improved is the vents...I live in Houston, Texas and the summers here are brutal.  I'm sure it didn't help that I picked a black SRX with charcoal interior...but the A/C system was a little too slow to cool the vehicle some days.  I ended up using the Onstar remote start feature a lot to get the car going and cooled off early.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this Caddy and I would consider buying one again (once the kids are older and in smaller booster seats)!

cadillac,srx,2011,creeative123, 02/07/2011,Loving My New Luxury SRX FWD,4,"I have been watching this vehicle since it came out in 2010.
I went back and forth between the Infinity FX35, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and the Cadillac SRX.
Coming from a Japaneese SUV I was hesitant at first, but I must say, GM really stepped it up a knotch.
I went with the Luxury Model and to be honest I don't think it is sluggish at all.
It is stylish, they spared no expense on all of the bells and whistles.
It can be alittle hard to see backing up but the camera which comes on your rear view mirror more than makes up for that.
You do loose a little head room with the Pani sunroof, but the benfits more than outway the negatives.

The only drawback is that it is a bit under powered, something that has been addressed in the new 2012. It's also the best looking SUV.

... unfortunately, this vehicle has been a disappointment.
I liked the exterior looks - mpg ok; however, should have checked the vehicles performance and technology out better - both a disappointment - not the standard I have come to expect from Cadillac.
Found the vehicle to be noticeably underpowered - transmission shifts in a odd way at times - very irritating technology (e.g. front crash warning beeps in the garage when backing out in reverse, the front seat when you turn off the vehicle moves back automatically so far you would not want someone in the rear seat, etc).

cadillac,srx,2011,TD, 06/29/2018,A Decent Car with a Some Glaring Issues,3,"We have owned this car four years. Bought used with low miles. Trips to New England, the Great Plains and many trips in between. The Good: Quiet, comfortable ride. Quality materials. Most comfortable driving car I've owned including a Lexus RX200. The Not-So Good: Front A pillar blind spot. The front pillar is so large it often blocks people walking in a crosswalk if you are turning a corner. Headlights: Just plain dim. Almost worthless. SatNav: Just ridiculous. The suggested routes it takes are miles out of your way. Google Maps is far more accurate on choosing a route. The software needs a major update but updates are few and far between. Acceleration: Don't expect to win any races. Anemic at best. The Bad: Timing chain issues. Seriously? Of all the cars I've owned over 40 + years, including Lexus, Ford, Audi, BMW, on and on, this is the only car where a timing chain has needed replacement. If your 'Check Engine' light comes on, be afraid. Very afraid. This little repair item will set your bank account back, oh, say about $2000. Apparently, timing chain issues are common with this GM engine no matter which car; Cadillac, GMC or Chevrolet. You've been warned. Depreciation: The SRX has one of the highest depreciation rates of any used car. This is great if you are looking for a nice, used high-end luxury SUV for a bargain price, but not so great for resale value. While we have really enjoyed this car,  the major issues that have cropped up have soured me on buying another GM product. Update 1/6/2020: Since my initial review, the windshield wipers failed twice. Again, another expensive repair on a GM product that I've never experienced with any other make. I believe GM now has a recall on Chevrolet Equinox wipers which are the same part, but nothing on Cadillac thus far. The headlights on the car are unsafe for night driving. There is a class action law suit against GM for this defect but no resolution to date.

cadillac,srx,2011,Jay, 01/08/2019,2011 srx luxury AWD,3,"got a used srx lux awd at 110,000 miles. Head restraint sticking forward causing neck pain. Brake pedal sticking so much higher than gas pedal causing knee pain. Front wheel bearing was replaced in 2016 but had to be replaced again in 2018. Water always getting into headlight and burning out bulb. Water from sunroof leaking into passenger compartment. Fixed all these problems by myself. Seats so hard it is not comfortable combined with a very stiff suspension. A/C not working. Bluetooth only connects to phone calls and not music. 12v phone charger inside glove box; difficult to access. Engine seems to be in good condition and doesn't seem to consume oil or coolant. Nice quiet ride on highway. Huge blind spots; giant A and B pillars, almost ran over people couple of times. No torque and needs 4000 - 5000 rpm to keep up with traffic, weird transmission with huge delay in downshifting, and throttle has delay of quarter second-the most unresponsive car ever driven. The temperature and vent controls are buttons which is difficult to adjust. Gets 14 city 18 combined highway going very slow.

update: went on a 2 hour trip. After that I developed tailbone pain. The seats are like rocks. Also forwarding CD is not easy. 

a/c not working because the water from the sunroof leaking  into passenger compartment caused rust and corrosion on the evaporator. now dash needs to be pulled and $1700 work needs to be done for the a/c to be working again. 

wheel bearings went out in 2020 again. $800 for two rear bearings!

cadillac,srx,2011,dallasfarmboy, 12/14/2010,I'm Disappointed in Cadillac and Sewell,3,"We purchased a new 2010 SRX almost 9 months ago and it has 6,000 miles on it.
First, the gas cap is directly over the right rear tire which forces the gas tube to run parallel to the ground.
This causes almost any gas pump nozzle to constantly stop or fall out, so you have to hold the dirty nozzle the entire time. Despite many complaints from many buyers, GM and Sewell resolve this issue with a letter to complainants telling them they don't know how to fill their car.
The other issue is a slushing sound in the gas tank.
This is very annoying and sounds like a lead ball rolling around in the back. The visibility, long hood, and sluggish and jumpy acceleration are also poor."

When we got it we though it was a great value compared to the big three from Germany. The ride is really rough. I suspect this was some sort of effort to make the SRX sporty. It is really tight, and it seemed every little bump could be heard and felt inside it car. The interior is nice, and the price for the content is better than those from Germany. But gas milage is so-so. We average about 25 MPG on the high way, and 15 city. It's overall average isn't much better than my fullsize truck. If you're gonna spend $50k there are better offering for mid-size crossovers."

Cargo room is adequate and the cargo gate is a nice idea.  Keeps things in place in the hatch.

The engine leaves a lot to be desired, but it's fair.  Rides like a luxury should, but very noisy when you need to pass, or merge on the freeway from the underpowered engine.  Poor fuel mileage with about 16'5 tops in city driving.  At 6' there's plenty of leg room, and some to spare.  Difficult to program different things i.e. radio etc."

It is cumbersome to drive.
I went from an Acura MDX to the SRX and every day, I miss my MDX which had much more room, but was much more agile than the SRX.
I have already had transmission problems.
The cargo space is miniscule.

The navigation system is very good and the stereo is top of the line.

Also we have to replace all the drain tubes in the car now to secure that this hopefully will not happen again.

GM customer service answer to my dilemma: ""we can't do anything if the service people can't duplicate the problem!""
Do they think I am draining the battery for the fun of taking the car back to the 50's type dealership (three times, and leaving the car for a total of 8 days)? They apparently forgot that I'm not only a customer, but one of the taxpayers whose

cadillac,srx,2011,A.S., 04/13/2018,An Expensive Chevy,3,"With a price tag north of $50,000 I expected a premium feeling vehicle, but instead feels like an over-priced Chevy.  Appearance-wise, the SRX is great looking SUV, but that is where my positive opinion of it ends.  It only has 17,000 miles on it, but it looks like it has over 100,000.  The leather seat is already worn and cracking, the interior panels are popping out of place, and the leather on the steering wheel is faded.  The SRX is a very cheap feeling vehicle.  The rear hatch doesn't open because water got inside and damaged it.  The water damage was repaired under warranty, but the dealer won't fix the hatch motor, even though Cadillac acknowledged that it was caused by the water getting in.  Also, the roof trim on both sides are popping up by the windshield and I can't get it back in place.  Performance wise, the SRX is severely underpowered.  The 3.0L under the hood is not competent enough to move this SUV and it feels like I am towing something, but it's just the lack of power.  The technology in it is a joke.  Bluetooth doesn't work and when you try to pair the phone the system freezes.  If I have a USB cord plugged into my phone the car won't recognize it and says it is not supported.  The navigation is garbage, very inaccurate.  The whole interface is overly complicated and slow.  Luckily, this vehicle was inherited and not purchased.  My family gave up on domestic vehicles long ago and the SRX is a reminder of why.  You can do no better than purchasing a pre-owned Japanese luxury vehicle.  They are super affordable, reliable, and have great resale value.  There is a reason why a used Lexus RX350 with 100k miles cost the same as a used SRX with 30k miles.

The ride and comfort is very similar to the DTS I traded in as well as the overall feel of driving.  It has just about every feature one could want, including a Bose sound system.

So I decided to lease SRX and have it for about 3 weeks with 550 miles on it. Combined mpg as per the car computer says less than 15 mpg, a far cry from the window sticker which says 17 & 23. This poor showing despite having a less powerful engine put into the car which sacrifices pick up power and supposedly giving better mileage. This leaves a lot to be desired and would require GM to improve this major short coming. Other than this, the car has been problem free so far and I hope I didn't make a bad decision. "

cadillac,srx,2012,madillini, 03/19/2014,2012 SRX Performance,5,"Bought this car a month ago. Also considered the Lexus 350. It wasn't even close. The SRX seems much roomier inside and has many more nice features. The exterior is chiseled yet sleek, the interior is roomy and comfortable. Seats are very supportive and love the pull out thigh support on the drivers side. Haven't used the GPS much but no problems with accuracy when I did. I actually like the push button parking break. Drive is very quiet, acceleration is quick, steering is responsive, shifting is ultra smooth, this car is a joy to drive.

cadillac,srx,2012,commander58, 01/13/2012,Very happy with the SRX,4,"2012 FWD Luxury model. Great lease value compared to competetors such as Acura MDX. Infinity EX, FX, etc. Delaership experience excellent. SRX rides fantastic. Road noise non-existent. Handling, acceleration, shifting of the transmisson all great. Seats are firm, but I find the SRX to be very comfortable. Great feature content on the Luxury trim level. Averaging 21 mpg with mostly highway driving. Very pleased with the exterior & interior appearanc eand build quality. I was in the market for a luxury SUV/CUV and found this to be the best value out there. I have not had a GM product for quite a few years, and I'm very impressed so far!"
cadillac,srx,2012,rocky92, 03/28/2014,Good All Around SUV,5,"My 2012 SRX is front wheel drive luxury model with 18 inch wheels. Original owner and no reason to get a newer vehicle. Good handling, quite, and good pick up and smooth and I drive it aggressively at times. All around MPG is 20 to 21 MPG which is better than the AWD models. The 2012 model has buttons which I like better than touch screens.

cadillac,srx,2012,dtrotter61, 09/14/2011,Caddy SRX is a Winner,4,"The addition of the new 3.6L V6 engine made the already good SRX a class leader in its category.
While it possessed head turning looks and a luxurious interior, it lacked the performance necessary to run with the Big Dogs.
The new engine provides a throaty growl when accelerating and provides plenty of passing power on the freeway.
When combined with excellent fit and finish inside and out and great driving dynamics, braking and acceleration, the SRX now has the total package.
Having moved from a Lexus RX 350, which I loved, the SRX is more powerful, stylish, engaging and dynamic vehicle that
possesses excellent ergonomics and technology.

cadillac,srx,2012,Grug, 11/27/2017,Buyer Beware!,2,"Loved the look and the ride of this car.  At about 40,000 miles things started to go south. The check engine light began to come on intermittently.  Had it checked by the dealer, but after several rounds of tests, they found no cause.  Next I began to notice condensation in my headlight casing.  This stayed for a couple of years, now both headlamps have stopped working on the same day!  Again to the dealership, where I was notified it was a $3,000 repair! This was for the labor and head lamp assembly!  Outrageous!  I googled the issue and find this is a well known issue with this car starting in 2010.  GM will do nothing and act like they don't know it exists. Ironically, while shopping the car to trade in on a ""non GM"" car, all the other dealers are very aware of the problem.  I will never by a GM car again!  Horrible customer service.

i'm extremely happy with the SRX. The Caddy has such style inside and out, its a treat to look at! The performance is also very pleasing, it gives up nothing to the competition in this area, we crossed shoped this vehicle with several others (except the Lexus Rx as we were not all that happy with ours) and the Caddy came up on top."
cadillac,srx,2012,JC, 10/04/2015,2 for 1 and did my homework,4,"I traded in my 05 Infiniti q45 and 04 Chevy trailblazer in for the Srx.  I wanted all the same features both vehicles had together. I look at the Lincoln, Mercedes , Infiniti and BMW. But for the value you could not beat Cadillac. I am a 6'3"" male that's sits comfortably inside and do not have a problem getting in or out. Cadillac services or will maintain the vehicle for the next 3 years all free. I test drove a 2015 but settled on the 12. Didn't want big car payments. Plus the only difference is the navigation radio system but everything else is the same.  It has 22000 miles and certified pre-own. I had it a month a get 21 mpg around town and 25 on the highway.  This is great compared to my last v8 and v6 engines. And it takes regular gases.  The dealer also washes it at every service a sweep as give you a brand new loaner. I do recommend you test drive.

cadillac,srx,2012,Amanda, 10/18/2015,Sexual white chocolate,4,"Let me start off by saying this vehicle is gorgeous! A real looker, and there aren't too many of them out there alongside all of those Ford Edges and Nissan Muranos. The interior is impressive, even though we don't have the large nav screen, it still looks great. Expensive looking. The leather is high quality and the reason we bought the 2012 is because it really doesn't look worn at all.. We've only recently figured out why it doesn't look worn - it's very uncomfortable!! I'm 6'0 and had to sit in the backseat for 4 hours, and honestly it was less comfortable than an airplane for me. My head kept hitting the roof, i couldn't put my knees straight out, and for some reason this models' back seats don't recline (thought that was standard but it may only be for Performance models) so you're literally sitting stick-straight the whole time and the seats don't give in any way. The front seats are much more comfortable than the back, but still less comfortable than our 2013 Jetta SE. If it's beauty you're after, and something with a sturdy interior that will last, then this car is for you. If comfort is priority, look elsewhere (we test drove an MKX and it was very very comfy all around).

I have a handheld Garmin that takes me to my driveway - but the Cadillac Nav system puts me 1/2 mile away. My dealer attempted to drive another 2012 SRX with Nav to my address and that vehicle also made wrong turns. AVOID this option.

Of course all of this is now out of warranty. Contacted a Cadillac dealer and he states ""everything breaks - go ahead and buy a jeep, I don't care"", contacted Cadillac and got the ""sorry for your luck"" statement.

Mind you the 3.6 is no Ferrari, but at least the engine doesn't seem stressed under hard acceleration. Even with the 20 inch rims, the car sacrifices little interior noise. Reasons for buying this car vs competitors: Q5- RELIABILITY ( we've had 6 Audis/VW- ALL HAVE BEEN A HEADACHE) 
GLK- Too small inside. Lexus RX- Too Boring to look at and drive. Evoque- nice, but see Q5 comments and multiply that by 20= Land rover. "
cadillac,srx,2012,tweeder, 06/03/2013,Unreliable Nav System.,4,"While I enjoy all the reasons I chose the SRX (ease of entry/exit, style, seat comfort, handling, etc), the expensive Navigation system is a joke! The map display is fine, the audible prompts are OK, the way it works with POI's is confusing, but the main reason for having a GPS system (guiding you to a destination) is totally unreliable!
I, like so many others I now discover, have, in only a few months of ownership, experienced numerous incidence of inaccurate directions.
Apparently the map database used is woefully out of date and inaccurate.
To compound the disappointment, GM knows it's bad and offers no fix!
Back to Japan or Korea for next car!"

Awesome! I read complaints about the 2011 engine revving up and down and tried it. I agree.
I have had mine for about 5 days now (lol).
The 3.6L is very nice and I have been driving it in the ECO mode for the past 2 days. Plenty of power and am getting about 20.7 MPG. The inside is very refined, comfie and stuff is easy to get to."

It rides good.
 However... there are a lot of ""little"" things, details, that were missed.
 I am convinced that the people they let drive the pre-production versions of this car were people that had a vested interest in keeping development cost down, and getting the car to production on time.

Next the brakes made a strange chirping noise, front pads and rotors, now the engine misfires. It has been in shop for a total of 45 days for this problem. GM cannot fix it not the dealer where car was purchased or the GM engineer dept. The car just misfires when it feels like it. GM tried cols 1,4 map sensor,throttle and alot of other parts.

cadillac,srx,2012,kerry f., 03/06/2019,2012 Cadillac SRX,5,"Everything was great except the low beam headlights which should have been recalled by GM.  California won a class-action suit against GM, because of the rubber O-ring/seal/molding at the back opening allows moisture to get in and destroy the reflective material overtime. The low beam headlamps get dimmer and dimmer to the point of severe danger.  Cost for GM to repair $1700, and they put the same crap in.  Saw one individual who had LEDs installed on Youtube, and only cost $250.00.  Not sure what state though.  Other than that I would have never sold the car. Loved that car.  If you are in the city/suburbs with street lights you will never notice it.  Also, my one co-worker is 6' 8"" and loved the passenger front seat, because he had room for his legs and was not against the ceiling.  Lots of cargo space too.

cadillac,srx,2013,pensman, 04/14/2014,Not Quite There but close,4,"The SRX handles well, especially on highways; but visibility is an issue. The rear view mirror is too small.  Probably the worst I have dealt with but I suspect the size is such because of the side ""pillars"" which can obscure your view. So you really need those side mirrors that light up to warn you when a car is passing.  Having the defensive driving add-in helps. Plus my model has a driver's seat that vibrates should you start to drift into another lane. On the highway, I have managed to get 24 mpg. The CUE system needs some major improvements as it is totally non-intuitive nor can apps be added to it which I believe is a big mistake.  And the HD radio can drift which makes it difficult to hold on to a station. Storage in the rear compartment is excellent.  No spare tire, just a can of stuff that you use to halt a leak/puncture as you then limp in for help.  I have had a few problems with the power driver's seat. The seat refused to drop down.  It was repaired, unsuccessfully, several times. Finally, I insisted the seat and power mechanism be replaced.  But after I left the car with the dealer, who promised to drive it and prove the repairs worked, I received a call informing me the entire seat and all would be replaced. I still enjoy the car but my wife isn't as enthusiastic.  Actually, she hates it. She finds she can't cope with the rearview mirror.  She drives an Audi Q5. I like the way the SRX handles, and it is great for highway driving and holds the road well for a front wheel drive car. This Caddy is still a road winner. A friend bought the new XT5 and I have noticed some good tweaks, but this model is still great to drive but I have wished at times there was more storage in the back. Time has passed but the car is still a winner with me. As I take care of my cars, the SRX looks new. I'd like to trade it in for a new XT5 but I can't come up with a good enough reason. It's good that I like this car.

cadillac,srx,2013,Kevin Taube, 10/26/2015,Cadillac SRX Review,5,"We were looking for a late model used CTS sedan when we came across this 2013 SRX Performance model.  The car was a lease return and had only 11,300 miles on it.  The car is also Certified, meaning we get an extended warranty for no additional cost.   The Cadillac salesman was very helpful and came down to meet our offer without making us go through annoying back and forth with a sales manager.  Overall, a very good experience. 

The car is primarily for my wife and met her requirement for AWD and outward visibility.  Having a very positive experience with the 3.6 engine in my older CTS,  I was pleased to see that this car had the same motor.  This motor has proven its performance and reliability for more than 10 years on tens of thousands of GM cars and trucks, including the Chevy Camaro.  After more than two months, we are very pleased with the car.  We enjoy the XM radio on the CUE system and the back up camera and parking assist features work flawlessly.  The car even brakes automatically to prevent backing into a bush (or worse).   

While it does not afford an overly generous amount of space in the rear cargo area, few SUV's of this size do.  The auto power lift gate opens the door well out of head bumping range and is adjustable should you prefer less of a lift height.  The front seats are very supportive and appear to be made of quality materials and craftsmanship.   The heated power seats  will adjust to any reasonable position and provide very good support.  The sun roof is very impressive, opening up directly overhead for front passengers and having a fixed roof window for those in the rear.  Overall a very comfortable and solid ride car. 

The performance is the best part of this car.  It goes fast and shifts authoritatively.  The car will carve turns at speeds twice that of those posted with no noticeable body roll.  Steering is taught and braking superb.  Acceleration is outstanding for a two ton SUV.  It should be noted that the Performance model does require that you give up that softer, quieter Cadillac ride to a noticeable  degree.   If that's a concern, you should consider one of their world class sedans.   

We are very happy with this car and would buy it again.  If you're concerned about buying a Cadillac, you needn't be.  Cadillac has come a long way in ten years and is making great cars.   And you will have the added benefit of knowing that you are supporting an American company.

My beautiful vehicle I was so proud to drive, so proud to own has let me down. Now that the new XT5 has come out and replaced the SRX the value of my SRX has plummeted below my loan amount.

cadillac,srx,2013,phytkv, 05/11/2017,Obsessed!,4,"Craved a 'caddy' ever since forever! Art 'n Science design themed SRX offered best of what I wanted/needed; snazzy style, ample cargo space, loads of comfort & safety technology. A better torque-to-speed ratio would definitely be a useful improvement! Gas mileage is acceptable for a vehicle of this weight, but ONLY if you stay on top of required maintenance schedules, replace tires ahead of suggested interval, maybe treat it to a fuel system cleaning from time-to-time?  Downside, buzzy, slow-ish acceleration. When I want to pass, I want to pass then, not later! However, once it gets there, it moves!!  This vehicle would definitely benefit from enhanced engine compartment sound insulation. Perhaps higher quality materials could've/should've been used?? Getting accustomed to the fat 'c' pillar blind spots is a thrill, but also potentially dangerous. All things considered; electric vs. gas, coupe-sedan-truck, vanilla vs. rocky road, I love my SRX waaaayy more than not!! Unfortunately, now have to consider a competitor's product due to the XT5's size and lack of appeal to me. The new XT4 is too small for my needs and lacks same/similar verve, so I'm forced to consider replacing w/ a competitor vehicle i.e. Jaguar F-Pace Sport, Range Rover Discovery or a yet-2b-determined vehicle. Because SRX's unique design stands out (in a good way!) among the industry's current smoother, softer design direction, I'm pleased Cadillac isn't completely abandoning the A & S theme.

The cue system started acting up about 30k miles, I took it into dealership, they said it was fine...at 60148 miles, the cue system went out...Cadillac refused to cover this because I was 148 miles over warranty.  Told me it would cost $1200 to fix minimum and they wouldn't know until they got in there.  I bought new screen on Amazon for $80 bucks and had a local mechanic install it for an additional $80.  About 70k miles on the car and I notice that my tires are not holding air...started with one then ended up being all 4 of them.  My rims had corroded so much that the tire wouldn't seal to the rim.  Cadillac dealer says I need 4 new rims, I took it to another shop and paid the labor cost for them to grind the rims so that they would seal.  Caddy dealer told me they tried and it didn't work...other repair place in town was able to do the job. 80k miles and the battery needed replaced, 90k miles and the ac went out and I began to notice the paint on the hood of my car is looking like its bubbled.  The ac compressor needs to be replaced...1200.00.  This is the last straw for me...before I get a chance to trade...my low oil light comes on...apparently my car is now using oil.  Its not leaking so it must be using  it.  I've owned several lower end vehicles and have never had the issues I have had with supposed quality high end vehicle.  Big thumbs down Cadillac...on your product and your lack of customer service skills.

cadillac,srx,2013,Ms Payne, 05/23/2019,6 year owner of the SRX,4,"I purchased the 2013 SRX new with 5600 miles on it. Six years later I'm at mile 61K and still enjoy my car.
PROS - smooth, dependable road car. I love taking long trips driving this car. The performance is great; it accelerates and shifts very well.  The power heated seats are very comfortable and is adjustable to multiple positions.  Love the lumbar seat adjustment feature of this car.  The large sunroof is great.  The BOSE system has great surround sound.

CONS - Visibility. I'm a 5'1 female and can barely see from the sides because the side pillars obscure my view. I have to be extremely cautious when making turns or pulling out into traffic. 
The glass on the CUE Infotainment center started de-fragmenting (I learned this is a flaw of several Cadillac models with CUE) and I was unable to use any of the CUE features - GPS, Radio, Heating/Cooling.  It cost me almost $400 to get the glass replaced.  I'm very disappointed the dealership didn't replace this flawed glass for free since the de-fragmenting is no fault of the car owner. 
The stored radio channels cannot be deleted after they have been set.  Your only option is to set a new channel over the old one. 
Back seats are only comfortable for young kids and teens. Rear storage is very limiting. 

Overall, I enjoy this car but recently learned dealerships are no longer offering the free oil perks that I always enjoyed with all my Cadillac purchases.  That added to my disappointment with the CUE system has me looking at other luxury cars."

cadillac,srx,2013,roy79, 02/20/2014,SRX-DISAPOINTED,3,"I am very disappointed in my SRX. The seats are uncomfortable, rear visibility and right side visibility are poor, the transmission shifts rough. I have gotten more accustomed to the CUE system and it is easier to use, even though it is slow to respond and continues to be difficult to use in traffic. The air conditioner is poor and not made for Texas heat. When starting, you have to drive a couple of city blocks before you get cool air. I keep the temp on the lowest position and the fan on high most of the time. The car did not come with a spare tire and I got a big sales pitch about how great Cadillac service is, in all parts of the U.S., even rural areas. Cadillac service has not been that great when I park it in front of their door. So I am afraid to take it out of town on the road. I have a second car that I use for vacations. I like the safety features. The seat shaker gets your attention and when backing a large triangle appears on the screen if you have cross traffic. The 307 HP engine is nice, but you pay for the power with poor gas milage. The interior has not held up very well. The carpet and floor mats are very poor. I've had a couple of minor mechanical problems, but overall the drivetrain has been reliable.

cadillac,srx,2013,Bob Baker, 03/14/2020,GM just can’t seem to get it right,3,"There’s a lot to like about the SRX. The styling is distinctive, there’s plenty of interior room, it hauls a lot in the cargo area, the ride is comfortable, and the voice activated navigation system is easy to use. 

Now the flip side. The mechanical and electronic reliability is highly suspect. The nav screen had to be replaced after the system died. Both front seat heaters stopped working. The fuel pump failed (leaving my wife stranded), the transmission started to shift very abruptly, a whining noise developed in the rear differential, the check engine light illuminated on a few occasions for no apparent reason. Fortunately, all of these expensive repairs were covered by the CPO warranty.

But worst of all are the low beam headlights. They are incredibly dim, barely brighter than the daytime running lights. And their brightness has continued to deteriorate as the vehicle ages. After years of denying that a low beam problem existed, GM has finally (in 2020) owned up to the issue and is willing to replace the headlights (at a coat of over $1600), which the vehicle owner must pay up front and then request reimbursement from GM.

This will be my last Cadillac.

cadillac,srx,2013,ptownsteve, 02/21/2013,Absolute Delight,5,"Turned in our 2010 SRX at lease termination last month in exchange for a 2013 and am delighted with the new 2013 version.
While I liked the 2010 it had several shortcomings including the engine and a lack of some features.
The 2013 has addressed all these concerns and more.
The engine is superb, smooth and powerful and there are lots of additional features which I love including a heated steering wheel, and many more.
And, the new CUE system is awesome.
There is absolutely no shortcoming I can find, only complete satisfaction.

Takes a little getting used to but I have found I am becoming more and more dependent on all these safety features.  I had a a fairly new SUV and found on the highway it was not as safe on long trips so traded up to the SRX Luxury, haven't regretted my move....  Have owned many luxury cars over the years, including Cadillacs, but this is my new favorite.

cadillac,srx,2014,Melissa, 11/17/2015,It returns the favor,4,"Remember the commercial...when you turn your car on, does it return the favor?  This one does!  Couldn't quite pull off the luxury package so we got the base and I do love it.  Loved it from afar from the first time I saw it.  My only issue is blind spots...they take a bit to get used to.  If I had to do it over, would have for sure gotten the rear camera.  Even with the base model, it is quite luxurious.  Great interior, easy to use and fun to drive.  Great gas mileage around town (over 17) and handles well in the snow and ice.  Feels sturdy when driving - we drove a few of the competitors which felt light weight and unstable - this one just felt safer when driving.  Interior - the black seemed to be the only model that had ""matching"" interior.  Did not care for one color dash, different color seats, different color carpet...then the wood accents...a little too pimpy for this lady.  Went with the black...black seats, dash and carpet and carbon fiber (rather than wood) and that did the trick.
Update:  I have had this for a little while now and still love it just as much as the day we brought it home!  We've taken it on a few trips and for the long haul, the ride is very nice.  I think my only complaint was $25 for a wiper blade...one wiper blade!  But I suppose its all relative...right?
Update:  Still in love with my SRX!  I have gone through all 4 seasons now and through rain and snow and ice and everything in between, this baby has taken care of us!  We have taken it across 2 states for weekend excursions and still believe it is the perfect vehicle for my needs.

cadillac,srx,2014,Hank, 05/30/2018,Let's go!,4,"This vehicle, with 24,000 miles on the odometer, makes me want to drive it everywhere. I left the house recently just to enjoy the night driving experience. I love the lighted trim pieces that encircle the interior, giving off a soft glow. (Counter point; the low beams are about useless, the most common complaint you will hear. Just terrible. I installed 4000 lumen LED's which fixed the problem.) I think of this vehicle as a large sports car as I speed up rather than braking for the S turns. I cannot believe it is a Cadillac.

cadillac,srx,2014,L Salas, 06/19/2018,Taken for a ride by Cadillac -GM,3,"GM does not want to take ownership of the fact that their headlight assemblies on my 2014 SRX and other prior/recent year SUV’s are dangerous as the headlights start dimming over time so you are unable to see less than 5 feet in front of your car at night. It is a danger to anyone riding in the vehicle and I am surprised that there have not been any serious injuries due to it that I could find. I contacted my local dealership as well as reached out to GM to no avail.   Because my original warranty had expired before the headlights had  become so dim that I started noticing there was an issue, I had to buy aftermarket lights and replace them ourselves. My selling dealership wanted 3x the amount of the lights to replace them at my cost!?!   It  is ridiculous that I had to pay for something that comes standard on a vehicle and shouldn’t have be replaced unless wrecked, especially at its price point. Shame on Cadillac/GM.   I thought you were better than this.  It has made me rethink of our loyalty to GM products all these years.

cadillac,srx,2014,Evelyn, 05/31/2016,Too many repairs,1,"I bought this car over a Range Rover Evoque, a BMW x5, and an Audi Q5.  What a mistake.  Based on my experience with this car I will never buy an American car again.  I have less than 20,000 miles on the car and I have had it in the shop at least 8-10 times for various issues.  Warning lights come on when there's nothing wrong with the car.  Driver's window has failed three times, in that without any warning it will not go up; instead it goes half-way up, grinds around, and goes down again.  The motor has been replaced and prior to that the gaskets around it were replaced.  Taking it in tomorrow for the third time.  The equipment in the cargo space is useless if you want to partition it off with the provided adjustable bar.  The bar is not solid, and items that you want to protect will slide through.  The temperature controls are supposed to be easy but they're not; you have to figure out the right touch on a flat surface, or you have to slide your finger across a very small area.  All while taking your eyes off the road.  The navigation system is very disappointing.  The maps are difficult to adjust, and the routes provided by the system are often the most confusing or the longest routes possible.  Again, I deeply regret buying this car and will trade it in as soon as the driver's window is fixed.

cadillac,srx,2014,Steve Rush, 01/27/2018,BEAUTIFUL SUV...TIGHT ON CARGO SPACE,4,"The 2014 Cadillac SRX Luxury Edition is a fine suv that looks terriffic, handles well, and checks most of the boxes in the ""customer satisfaction"" department. I have owned mine for 16 months and have had no issues with it mechanically. City driving yields around 15 miles per gallon and highway numbers come in around 18 miles per gallon. These numbers are a bit lower than I had hoped for, but the trade off is a nicely appointed ride with many cool luxury features. I am happy with the performance factor, as this caddy has plenty of zing under the hood to get you going there in a hurry. Cargo space allows for 4 sets of golf clubs, but with some difficulty, as it seems to be a bit lacking in width in that area. By comparison, my 2015 Honda CRV actually has more room for your cargo. My wife isn't a fan of the touch sensitive buttons, but isn't interested in learning either. Overall, an excellent suv, featuring good looks and power, and I would rate the reliability as 5 stars.

cadillac,srx,2014,roy79, 12/17/2013,I am disappointed in my SRX,2,"The view to the rear is very poor. The back up camera is a necessity. Right turn vision is also difficult. The front seats are hard and uncomfortable. My in town gas milage is below 15 mpg. The on board computer system is very fancy with a lot of Wow factor but it is very difficult to learn and is slow to respond. It is very difficult to make any adjustment safely while driving in traffic. Now that I have gotten accustomed to the CUE system it is easier to operate and I actually like it better than the system in my Lexus RX. The fact that the car does not have a spare tire keeps me from taking it out of town. Cadillac service has not been impressive even when I park it in front of their door, so I expect road service to be extremely poor or nonexistent. I paid over $50K for a car that I can't trust to drive on the highway. The air-condition system is very poor to the point that I never use the auto setting. It is NOT an air-condition system built for Texas. The rear air has to be adjusted every time you get into the car. The transmission is horrible, the worst automatic transmission I have ever seen. At times it shifts so poorly, I think it is going to jerk itself out of the car. I have had problems with it leaking oil in puddles on the garage floor.  Check engine light came on one time, not sure what they replaced. I will not keep the car without a warranty. I like the seat shaker and the big triangles that pop up if you have cross traffic while you are in reverse. Overall the safety features are very good. I think it looks better than the Lexus.

So many areas of disappointment.  The front seats are extremely uncomfortable on both short trips and long trips.  The headlights are very dim (HID are not standard ... unbelievable!) and make night driving a challenge.  Blind spots are problematic.  Turning radius is lumbering and the vehicle does not easily turn into tight parking spots.

Poor visibility less than 10 feet in front of car. Went to dealer and was told lights were fine but I said they weren't because I couldn't see the road very well. I had them install after market bulbs which made the road and signs visible but light is still dim and can really only safely see with high beams on. Was told this was an known issue with the srx and nothing could be done about this. Unreal that cadillac is not concerned with the safety issue at all. I think most owners are trading off and so this problem isn't getting reported by the dealers as it should be so these unsafe driving cars are still showing up at dealerships.

Also found many complaints on the NHTA website on this same issue.  Another issue is the CUE, it has cracked in my car.

I have been looking for a SUV to replace my 2011 Avalon.  My initial plan was the Lexus RX350. I was taken with the look of the SRX and decided to give it a test drive.  I was impressed with most everything in the car. As a kid I always thought Cadillac was a great car. In the ensuing years GM and Cadillac were never in my thoughts when it came to new cars.  I was happy to give GM a chance once more. I was able to get a good price esp with a $1500 rebate from Cadillac.  The 4 yr warranty and maintenance paid program was a big factor in my decision.  I just hope my faith is rewarded with a quality car.

This is a one year follow up. Overall I am very pleased with the car.  I have had one minor issue and it was quickly resolved.  

mGas mileage is as anticipated, in other words not great.   I have 12k miles on it and it rides great and looks great.  I noticed yesterday that I do not have a single paint chip on the front!  I can not say that about the Toyotas I have owned.  

I do love driving the car and the space is perfect for my requirements.  I an still not crazy about the button-less, knob-less dash design. I am getting used to it but I am not sure I would get another one.  

The navigation system is just horrible.  It cannot find well established roads, the time calculations are wildly out of whack and the routes can be interesting.  This system falls well short of what this car deserves.  The rest of the CUE system works fine most of the time.  The rain sensing wipers have a mind of their own, coming on for no apparent reason on bright sunny days.  

Two year update on this car.  Overall the car is still excellent. The issues I mentioned remain.  Over time I have found the cup holders to be awkward. This design issue was corrected in the new model.   

For some reason my memory seat quit working. I followed the instructions in the owners manual to no avail.  I mentioned it to the dealer we told me the manual was incorrect and he showed me how to reset the seat.  

The car is otherwise, working well and I have no regrets at buying it.  

The blind spot monitoring, cross traffic alert and lane departure warnings are great. I really appreciate them. 


I am happy that Cadillac has achieved quality parity with imports in the class.  It has been an enjoyable ownership experience so far.

Year 3 update. I am still enjoying this car.  I have mentioned a few of my dislikes. These are my personal pet peeves but overall I could say I am very glad I bought this.  The paint has held up much better than the paint on my Toyotas.  Chances are good I will buy another Cadillac, most likely it will be the SRX successor.  My trial of buying another Big Three car has worked out very well. There will always be naysayers but I will not be one after this ownership experience.

This is a 4 yr update.  The car has just completed the 48 month warranty period and so far it has not fallen apart.  I have really enjoyed driving the car and have had zero new issues other than I mentioned in earlier updates.  Still not a fan of the knob-less dash displays. I am well pleased with the car and I will likely replace it with a 2020 XT5 (rumor has it they will have at least some knobs on the CUE system).

cadillac,srx,2015,Robert, 01/05/2016,2015 Cadillac SRX - A Level Below Other Luxury Car,4,"I really like the SRX but it is definitively a level below other luxury car brands (i.e. Lexus, BMW, Acura, etc.), and I feel the same way about the dealership quality.  I negotiated a good deal on this car, and paid significantly less than I would have if I bought another Acura MDX (my previous car). So, based on the price, I have been satisfied, so far.
July'16 Update: I have grown to like this car even more over the past year. The transmission is not great but the dealership did make improvements. I continue to be satisfied.
Jan'17 Update: I continue to enjoy the SRX more and more. I have had no problems with it and the transmission adjustment the dealership provided resulted in a huge improvement. After 2 years with the SRX, I have begun to shy way from my initial comments above.
Feb'19 Update: Some problems have started to develop that shouldn't in a four year old car. The driver's window is operating very slowly and the dealer can't apparently fix it. The lane monitoring system has started to act up as well. The SRX simply is of the same quality as the Lexus I still own and the Acura MDX I used to own.

cadillac,srx,2015,Jeff, 01/22/2016,Most comfortable car I've ever owned.,5,"Most will say that the SRX is over-priced for a luxury crossover of its size.  And then they slide into that extremely comfortable front seat and drive away.  I knew after driving this car for less than a mile that I had to have it.  Front seats are extremely comfortable, especially if you have the ventilated seats.  My only real beef with the interior design is the memory seat function.  I'm not quite sure I understand the reasoning behind the need to continue to hold the seat memory buttons in order to adjust the seat if auto recall is not enabled (can be a real pain).  The response of the engine was somewhat sluggish at first.  Then I turned off the ECO setting and placed the transmission in Sport Mode.  What a difference.  It literally threw me and my passenger back in our seats.  Everyone complains about the fuel economy, but if you can afford the sticker price of an SRX to begin with a little extra for gas isn't going to turn you off.  I went from driving a Suburban to the SRX.  17 mpg average is a huge improvement from the 12 mpg (and that's not towing anything) I was getting in that beast.   The technology and entertainment package included in the Premium model are well worth the extra money.  Love the customizable driver information center.  The Cue system could be a little more responsive and it could be played out more logically.  Also, I would really like to see an update to integrate Android (and Apple if they really must) cellphones more.  The GPS is the most accurate I've used yet in a stock system.  My kids now insist on taking the SRX everywhere because of the entertainment system (I'm almost positive it's because of the fact that they each get their own seatback monitor with the capability of viewing separate sources).  The sound system is amazing, but then you'd expect that from Bose.  The safety systems are outstanding.  Lane-departure warning, side-blind warning, auto braking, auto adjusting cruise control (this is just PFM), and the list just goes on.  Cargo space is somewhat limited when compared with other luxury SUV's, but then if cargo space is what you're looking for you're probably not going to be buying a crossover.  All-in-all, the SRX is well worth the money (especially if you can find a lightly used demo with several thousands of dollars off).

cadillac,srx,2015,Tim, 01/21/2018,Second owner 2015 SRX Performance AWD,4,"This was my first cross-over SUV, having owned trucks for many years. I never purchase brand new vehicles because of the instant depreciation so I was specifically looking for a vehicle that was 2-3 years old with low mileage. In addition to the SRX, I researched and test drove quite a few different mid-size SUV makes/models including Acura, BMW, Ford, Range Rover, GM and Lexus. Each of the different SUVs had their own strengths and weaknesses when it came to power, comfort, handling, entertainment, etc. The SRX Performance AWD impressed me in many different areas, not the least being style and looks. I was very attracted to the ""Art and Science"" design incorporating the sharp angles and aggressive stance. In my opinion, it is far more appealing than the rounded and plain looking Acura and Lexus. From a driver's standpoint, the SRX didn't match the acceleration and handling of the BMW, but it was comparable or better than the other makes/models I drove. Steering is responsive and handling very good. The fact that this is the Performance AWD model probably aids in that category. I have read many negative comments about the CUE entertainment system and must say that I don't have much of a problem with it. It seems intuitive to me and responds quickly to any touch command. The Bose sound system is incredible for a stock/factory set-up. The comfort and safety features were as good or better than other models I drove. I guess the only real negative that I've come to experience is limited/restricted sightlines towards the rear of the vehicle. Thank goodness for the excellent back-up camera, driver assist package and tilting side-view mirrors! As noted in almost every review, gas mileage is probably the worst in this vehicle's class and the fact that I don't use ""Economy"" mode probably doesn't help. When in ""Economy"" mode shifting and acceleration is a little sluggish, so I prefer to drive in ""Sport"" mode. I've also noticed some negative comments about dealerships. I guess I'm one of the fortunate ones and have only received top-notch service from my local dealership and was really impressed that I haven't had to pay for any oil/filter changes up to this point. Having owned and driven the SRX for about 12 months, I can say I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to friends.

cadillac,srx,2015,David H., 06/18/2018,"""Red, Right, returning""",5,"This old sailor's motto marks my returning to Cadillac with a bright red 2015 SRX after some years with a 2009 Mercedes SUV.  And it's great to be back.  We bought our SRX from our local dealer when it was previously owned for a year with 11,000 miles on it - a real cream puff.  We feel we got a fair deal, a warranty better than the new cars and we totally love the car.  The comfort, convenience and performance are completely Cadillac.  And the gadgets are great too - the car is ""Fully loaded"".  We could probably live without the steering wheel warmer here in Florida but it's fun to brag about!  12/25/2019 - Here we are a couple of years later and the ratings are still the same.  No long trips yet so mileage is low. Car still looks like new and acts it too.6/24/2020: Report pretty much the same.  No long trips, still low mileage (about 26K I think - more for sure).  Tires becoming marginal it seems perhaps adding to higher road noise (along with rougher road surfaces related to lots of construction here in Central Florida).  The outside rear view mirror on the driver's side has clouded over and is on order (and on warranty I think).  We still love the car and it's still like new.

The Cadillac SRX has a major flaw in production. The sunroof drains are too short and will contract with time and heat. Cadillac issued a recall for this problem in every state but Texas because of Texas heat...... Well that is just not acceptable. Texas is one of the largest states in the us and has more GM vehicles sold than any other state. If you make a fault product you should fix it. Now the dealers want between $725 and $1500 to fix this issue. This is aweful of Cadillac to do to its consumers of Texas. This is a common problem with the SRX. Steer clear of a ccompany that wont stand by it product.

It made the last two picks, over the Volvo XC, Lexus RX350, Audi Q5 & 7.  Clearly of the American school: soft suspension, EPS (electric power steering) which isolated the feel of the road and attitude of the vehicle from the driver, had the body roll of an American car.  Liked the angular design.  Interior was first class hand stitched leather.  User Interface for the Entertainment system controls is kludgy, way behind Android and IOS phones.

I spent upwards of 40k for a car that malfunctioned with less than 300 miles on it. I don't know what the dealership (Barton Birks Chevrolet in Newburgh NY ) did to prep this car for delivery but obviously something got missed? This is not the outcome I expected after trading in a Honda CRV that never needed anything other than oil changes and tires. The dealership where the car was towed advised that the code read ""throttle body assembly"". This car just came out of the factory!!! I bought a new car so I could trust that when my family was away from home that the car we bought would keep them safe. Perhaps this is why they push the extended warranty at purchase.

cadillac,srx,2016,JTM, 09/07/2016,"Cadillac SRX 2016, Thoughts",5,"PROS: Engine, Handling, Front Passenger/Driver Room, Technology, Road Holding, and Ride Comfort. CONS: Fuel Economy, Curb Weight, Rear Passenger Room, Visibility, Noise (from Panoramic Window).  2016 Cadillac SRX was heavily discounted during the month of August 2016 and I decided to purchase one. Here are my thoughts after the first 500 miles. The car is pretty nimble for an SUV, actually 0 to 60 in about 7.5 seconds. Brakes feel very spongy, therefore,  one needs to press the brake pedal harder than normal for the car to stop. I presume, the car is still ""breaking in"" so I will monitor the braking issue and update after 3000 miles or so. The huge panoramic window is great, however, at highway speeds, it does get noisy. Have the Cadillac dealer adjust the windows to reduce the noise. Fuel economy is poor (so far). Again, I was told the engine needs to break in for max fuel efficiency. The transmission ""jerks"" between 1st and 2nd gear, however, this is normal. This SUV tries to balance the ""sporty"" aspect and the ""family hauler"" aspect so it does handle ""sportier"" when you push the vehicle. Moreover, this is ideal for a family of 4 to get around as well. If you have a larger family, Cadillac is working on another SUV between SRX/XT5 and Escalade. It is slated to be released around 2018. The SRX does have great warranty (4yr, 50K (basic) and 6 yr, 70K mi (powertrain)). Also, the first 4 years of maintenance are included with a new vehicle (oil changes, etc). The tires are Michelin Latitude and they ride pretty well. The ride comfort, in general terms, is excellent and the suspension soaks road bumps/imperfections pretty well. I have not had a chance to ride in the snow yet. I will update with the snow performance at a later time. The CUE system is mediocre and some folks may find the small lag time in response from the system frustrating. If on highway, use care when operating CUE as you may need to take your eyes off the road to adjust settings on the CUE system. Music/Entertainment options include: CD, MP3/HDD, XM, Radio. My unit did come with the Navigation/Bose 10 speaker set up. I did not have the Driver Assistance Package so cannot comment on it. Reliability: one has to keep in mind that the SRX is at the end of its life, therefore, unlike the XT5, one is buying a proven car which has most of its ""kinks"" worked out. For example, in 2010, GM decided to use the 2.8 Turbo and the 3.0L V6 on the SRX. The Turbo did not sell well and there was reports of engine trouble since people were using ""regular"" gas to power the Turbo engine (which is a big no-no in the automotive industry, NEVER use Regular gas in a Turbo engine, no matter what the manual says). The 3.0 V6 was underpowered to move the heavy SRX and was also discontinued. Then GM decided to use their corporate 3.6L V6 and that was the best match for a heavy SUV such as the SRX. Hence, you are getting a proven vehicle in the SRX. The XT5 is on its first year in 2017 and I, for one, do not feel comfortable being the guinea pig for GM's new vehicle line, especially, when I am shelling out 40K + on a new XT5. The SRX seems like a solid choice in the Cadillac lineup as far as reliability is concerned. Now, there are sensors everywhere on this vehicle.  So, expect some kind of sensor failure at some point during ownership, however, the engine/transmission combo is a ""proven"" for this vehicle. By the way, use ""regular"" gas for the 3.6L V6 engine. Cadillac has been trying hard to ""remake"" their image. They have moved their HQ from Detroit to New York and has taken on the ""Dare Greatly"" motto in an effort to set themselves apart from the rest of GM's vehicle lineup. With this in mind, I found the dealership experience to be very pleasant. All I had to do was show up and agree on a price. The sales team did the rest of the work including, calling my insurance to transfer the policy
 from my trade-in vehicle to the SRX. They did a lot of ""leg work"" to have me out of the showroom in about 1 to 2 hours. They did offer food and beverages for the Cadillac customers and was very polite and pleasant to deal with. Currently, the Lexus leads the pack in dealership experience, but Cadillac is not too far behind.

I had a lincoln mkt prior to purchasing this car and boy do i hate that i ever swirtched back to a cadillac.  The seats are hard and the positions  of the head rests are a pain in the you know what.  Im 5'7"" woman that likes to sit with a straight back.  I dont want my head pushed forward.  From 2007 to 2010 i had a cadillac cts and i loved that car.  It was fast, smooth and comfortable!  Switched to a lincoln and i truly loved driving my mkt.  I decided to downsize  and switch back to caddy.  Its a nice looking car however i loathe driving it because im terribly uncomfortable.  I wished i had just paid the extra money and stayed with lincoln and got a mkx.  Cadillac MAKE YOUR SEATS LIKE LINCOLNS OR BETTER! I am looking to sell my srx asap and get back into a LINCOLN!!!!!

cadillac,srx,2016,Glenn, 04/07/2018,Is this really a Cadillac?,3,"I have purchased about 6 Cadillacs over the last 30 years. I have always loved their styling, but have been disappointed in their claim to be a luxury vehicle. They are luxury in the sense they have many ""bells and whistles"" and a high price, but I have experienced too many repair services for quality problems. Thank God I have had good warrantee coverage especially with their certified program, but it is both inconvenient and frustrating to contend with this type of nuisance. Luxury should mean quality, and I start to wonder if BMW, Lexus, and even the American made Buick may be better choices in the future. I may have high expectations, but one or two quality problems erode on my definition of quality.

There is an issue with the SRX Sunroof drain tubes shrinking and popping off (very poor design).  They are supposed to fix this problem up until Jan 2017.  GM is fully aware of this and there is a customer satisfaction action that is for only a few States.  I live in Michigan so I am not covered.  The car has flooded badly and mildew has collected.  

If anyone has an SRX PLEASE stay out of the rain!  TERRIBLE customer service, worse engineering, and costly to own.

cadillac,sts,2005,SLG, 09/24/2015,"Comfortable ride, good performance, clean styling",4,"My 2005 STS Norstar V-8 since it was new.  Currently, it has almost 80,000 miles.  There were a few minor mechanical problems when new, all covered under warranty, but over the last several years the repairs have been minimal, or just routine maintenance.  The car has very good handling, braking and acceleration for a luxury car, and plenty of room to ride very comfortably, which makes road trips no problem.  With the Norstar V-8 it has plenty of power, but without sounding like a ""boy racer.""

The major caution when driving this car in wet, slushy, or icy conditions is the power.  The traction control is okay but does not really rein in the car quickly enough if the rear wheels loose traction.  I found that using snow tires during the slushy and/or winter months as well as adding 150 pounds of sand in the trunk made all the difference.
"
cadillac,sts,2005,Alex, 07/25/2016,Gorgeous car with a decent price tag.,4,"Bought this car from the dealership with 106,000 miles. It came in the ""white diamond"" color and the looks on this thing are head turning to say the least! This paint scheme practically could sell the car on its own! I've only owned the vehicle for a few months now but aside from a few flaws, which i'll point out, this is a relatively fun and comfy car to drive in. Firstly, for a car thats over 10 years old, the technology is surprisingly ahead of its game. Air conditioned seats, heated seats, driver recall settings, bluetooth which works great, nav system, dvd player, rear proximity sensors, tire pressure sensors, heated mirrors, and the list goes on and on! Too many electronics to name, which could be a blessing, or a curse, if any of these fancy bells and whistles malfunction. Thankfully its been smooth sailing so far, and everything has worked great. This car feels fast...i'm not one to boast about it, since I normally don't spend my time racing it, but it really does pick up and I find it almost hard not to give it some throttle on occasion. I find myself looking down at the speedometer from time to time and asking...""am I really doing 50 right now?!"". The only complaints I have so far are the suspension. This thing is certainly not the smoothest ride out there! It feels awfully stiff and you can feel each and every bump on the road. I dread things like potholes because in this car, you'll practically knock yourself out if you drive over one!! My girlfriend has complained multiple times about the bumpy ride, and though the interior is loaded with luxury, it isn't doing its job correctly if you aren't comfortable during the ride! Other than the stiff as a board suspension, this car is a blast to drive around! In my old beat up Cavalier...I regretted driving on the highway...mostly just merging onto the highway because the thing was so sluggish and unsafe. Now i'm eager to merge just to hear the engine roar for a few brief moments! Not to mention the car feels much safer as well. Lastly, I keep hearing bad things about the gas mileage. I deliver pizza as a side job, and after a 6 hour shift, i've gone through a little under 1/4 of a tank. Not too bad for my standards. Not expensive to fill up, and it isn't as bad of a gas hog as people say it is. Overall, i'll say that this car has been a dream come true for me in my mid 20's. I feel much more confident driving this car than I did with my previous one. I have more fun on the road, and I feel safer while driving it. Did I mention the sound system is awesome?!
"
cadillac,sts,2005,Christopher Newton, 07/24/2016,2005 STS v8 in 2016; So Much Car for so Little,5,"Ok, so I bought this car a few months ago for a little over $5k. Brand new, eleven years ago mind you, it was somewhere around $68k at the dealership. It is pearl white (my name for it because that's what everyone says it looks like), Northstar V8, with every imaginable option. All of them, each and every one of them, work - despite the age, despite the 130k plus miles. It has a quirk or two here and there, but nothing that hasn't been easily sorted out.  Also, apparently the previous owner decided to delete the mufflers and go with straight pipes (cats are still there obviously), and that alone sold me on it when I took the test drive. The SOUND, holy cow! OMGoodness, that noise. At around 3k RPM the V8 comes to life and rolls from a growl to a roar as you accelerate all the way to 6500. It's intoxicating if I'm honest. But mostly, inside and out, the car oozes class and elegance. Nevermind the snobs that say a plastic dash is cheap - frankly it doesn't LOOK cheap and who the heck goes around feeling the dash of a car every day anyway? No one, that's who. Everything is first rate, high-end and maybe ten or eleven years ago, at $67,000 one has a reason to complain about minute things. But today, at $5 grand or so - or even two or three times that if mileage is low enough to justify - it's simply to die for. I couldn't tell you the number of compliments I get on the car - it's several each week - even being more than a decade old, it's still an eye catcher. It's also a joy to drive, although it took some getting accustomed to for sure. I read one review where the owner laughably equated it to driving a truck. This clearly is due to the handling, probably magnetic ride, and the turn-in the car gives as it enters curves and counters G's. At first it feels like rear-end body roll but it's the shocks adjusting to the road and conditions and stopping roll before it starts. It's a unique sensation to the uninitiated. Mine handles terrifically, eating up curvy roads with ease and provides a steady confidence.  So, it looks amazing, drives amazing, and the features? Yes, it has a ton of them. The 8 inch LCD screen with navigation is great, I have the 2016 update DVD so it's not old or stale. Turn-by-turn, maps, searches that are a bit cumbersome at times, but once you learn the system it's fine. Also integrated is voice commands which are head-shakingly amazing. Just have to know the command and it works - most of the time lol. There are ones I use regularly that greatly simplify use of the car. Like ""windows down"", ""windows up"", or ""navigation home"". The head-up display is a feature I never knew I'd love so much. At first it was annoying, but as I grew accustomed to it, I will no longer drive a car without it if I don't have to. It's not just that it shows speed, but that it flashes up integrated data as well, most notably navigation turns. The adaptive cruise control is great, but sometimes traffic is just too heavy for it - although that's true of regular speed control also. Forward collision warning is nice for sure - in the event you're glancing away and you come close to another car or object. Automatic high-beam headlamps is nice too, but sometimes it doesn't turn off for an on-coming car. Remote start is really nice but I don't use it often as I'm not that pampered frankly. The automatic lights work well, but mostly I just turn it off and choose to set lights manually. OnStar and XM Radio are nice features I'm enjoying also, in addition to being able to use my phone's streaming media to pipe to the car's system via Bluetooth and the onboard RCA jacks. It's a 2005-era workaround for audio/video but it works. If you're looking to buy one of these cars, do a few things; 1) insist on the navigation center stack, it was part of a big option package and at a glance you'll know the car has other nice options 2) Adaptive cruise has
 issues here and there, but the head-up display system is first-rate and it's an option I'd insist upon, 3) Insist on the automatic wipers - seriously, it's one of the best features on the car, they rock, 4) If you're looking at an '05 to '09, insist on the Northstar V8, 5) Bottom line, get it with as many options as you can. You'll love the technology! I can't say enough good things about the Cadillac STS. In one word, it's ridiculous.

cadillac,sts,2005,Linda Noonan, 07/24/2015,Beautiful but many costly repairs.,2,"I loved the look and smooth ride.  I bought my STS with 7K miles, certified pre-owned with extended warranty.  At  18k miles the fuel pump went then 33K miles the water pump went after that it was something BIG each year.  Cat converter replaced, intake position sensors, replaced vent solenoid, motor mounts, right & left lower control arms just to list a few.  (seriously!)  Transmission started clunking especially while driving slow or going from reverse to drive.  Always garaged and maintained, I had to stop the $ bleeding at 85,000 miles when the transmission/drive train was about to drop out.  The Cadillac dealer said new drive train $3,500 and there would be possible other issues.  I'm done with Cadillac, this was my third, my beautiful Eldarado had mechanical troubles as well.  Too bad, they were such beautiful LOOKING cars.  Perhaps it is the aluminum North Star engine?  Since my experience I have heard of others having numerous problems with this system.

It never gets old driving this car. When I bought it, the car was still under warranty and I had some small issues fixed without a problem. The performance of a car this heavy is nothing less than what you would expect from Cadillac. The interior looks great and very classy.

This AWD car replaced our beloved 2003 Audi A6 and surpassed it in almost every way (gas mileage being one of the only exceptions [minor]). The car is built as well if not better, has AWD, is incredibly fast for a heavy 4-door, looks fantastic in every angle-inside and out, fun to drive (handles well), and the stereo wipes out every other car stereo I've ever heard-standard or aftermarket. 97k miles on it and has been absolutely reliable.

I was impressed with the Northstar engine and power, although it was a little soft and ""grandpa"" like for me.  I saw a 2005 STS V8 and decided to test drive.  I fell in love and purchased.  It is much more sporty, handling more like a Mercedes than ever imagined.  It is very comfortable, similar to Seville but not as soft, fast, a head- turner, reliable and oozes class! Not one problem so far. Absolutely love it!"

Also, there is excessive road (tire) noise at highway speeds. The front end feels sloppy going over small (speed) bumps. The front struts were replaced approximately two weeks after purchase.

Poor resale value has worked just fine for us since we can buy a little more car for the money on the used market.  Overall, I like the styling of the STS inside and out.  Many prefer the CTS in both respects, but I prefer the toned-down design of the STS.  I am not normally an extended warranty fan, but anybody considering the STS would be wise to find one under factory warranty, or in the case of a 2005 or 2006, a factory CPO warranty. Many little problems crop up.  Take reviews here with a grain of salt.  The 'high-end' stereo is NOT all that and is easily trumped by a decent aftermarket ones."

cadillac,sts,2005,sports sedan, 08/27/2006,2005 STS,4,"I bought this car new 7/26/06 with 355 miles on it. Within two weeks, I made a trip to WA state. I never averaged below 25.5 MPG. For the most part, I averaged near 28 MPG. The acceleration was great. The dip stick showed little or no use of oil. I thoroughly enjoyed all the amenities (OnStar, XM radio, dual a/c, and driver memory settings). The STS was quiet and practically drove itsself, even on poorly maintained roads."
cadillac,sts,2005,mack, 02/03/2007,Best Car I Have Owned,5,"The 2005 Cadillac STS is by far the best car I have ever owned. I traded a 2003 CTS in for this one. The CTS is sort of a ""Starter Cadillac."" The STS' bells and whistles seem to never end. I keep finding new ones. Its ride is awesome."
cadillac,sts,2005,Connie Lara, 04/07/2008,Uncomforable driver's seat,3,"I really enjoy the power my car has but, I  really have a problem with  the comfort of the driver's seat.  After a 3 hour drive my right leg starts to cramp and I get pain in my hip.  I attributed this to back surgery but after reading the reviews on this car I am glad to find out it is not me.  The dealership has been great but I am disappointed with the car considering it is supposed to be a luxury vehicle."
cadillac,sts,2005,Linda L. Felton, 05/21/2008,I bought the STS lemon,4,"I purchased my STS in January, 2005 and was stranded on the highway by October, 2005 needing a new gear shift.  Since December 21, 2006 I have been stranded with a dead battery six times and rough riding with the check engine light twice on Sunday trips of 200+ miles. By the time I get to the dealership after being delivered 5 new batteries in 3 years, the problem cannot be duplicated. Neither of the two dealerships have been able to duplicate the problems so they say there is no problem.  There were 6 month intervals from 2006-2007 but 2008 has already recorded January 24, February 18, and May 18.  "
cadillac,sts,2005,Paul, 01/03/2009,Don't buy one,3,"This was my dream car. I am a very loyal GM buyer over the last 25 years. I can tell you I will never own one again. This was the icing. Uncomfortable creeky seats, electrical problems, stereo problems, alarms going off in the middle of night. In all had the car in the shop for at least 18 times. To top it off, GM called me to offer money off my next one. The front tires are different size than back. No rortation=many tires. Rides like a Jeep! I am sorry if this is too harsh but if you looked at my carfax you would say I'm being kind"
cadillac,sts,2005,Just Brilliant, 02/03/2009,Affordable muscle,3,"I keep a number of cars- for business, fun, performance and some just to look at.  The STS is meant for business appts and really fits the category.  Picking a client up in a $100k car or a $1k car sends a message.  It's great for taking my hottie out on the town.  No worries about the elements or parking lots.  Don't settle for less then a fully optioned vehicle. Get the heads up display, V8, navi, sunroof, 15 speaker bose, adaptive cruise, 18 inch wheels.  Reliability is an issue along with finding knowledgeable, competent and confident service. "
cadillac,sts,2005,jct, 11/06/2010,Do not buy a Cadillac,4,"We bought the car with 16,000 miles on it and right away we found out the car needed new tires and the wheels were way out of alignment and shortly after had a problem where it wouldn't start after filling it up with gas and had to get that fixed. at around 50,000 miles trans started to go out and finally went out at 77,000 miles and got that fixed. The same day we got the trans fixed the ac compressor froze up and it started spitting antifreeze out all over."
cadillac,sts,2005,aaron s, 09/17/2004,outstanding,5,"Recently turned in my E55 MB, feel the 
fit and finish of my new STS is 
outstanding.  Bought the STS  on the 
whim after test driving, never thought 
Id be back buying a non german 
auto......"
cadillac,sts,2005,Gordon Lewis, 07/27/2004,STS better than a BMW,4,"Previuosly owned a BMW 528 sedan - 
Cadillac STS is by far as much if not 
more automobile for the buck & with 
just as much bang when it comes to 
handling, performance & comfort."
cadillac,sts,2005,ahmaduhhs, 10/23/2012,Good and Bad :(,3,"Owned the 2000 STS, 2001 STS, 2002 STS, 2003 STS and now the 05 STS. The interior is shameful compared to the 98-04 STS. The exterior however is marvelous particular the front and back end. Lots of standard features love the power of the V8 N*. Heard the V6 was no good :("
cadillac,sts,2005,Layn, 10/09/2004,NOT THE BEST,3,"The looks of the car are very stylish. 
It is definately a great looking car, 
but the interior has something left to 
be desired.  The leather is hard and 
not too comfortable.  It is a lot like 
the leather in the CTS. STIFF AND 
RIGID.  Not too sure about reliability 
yet.  Cadillac has not been known for 
excellence in reliability as of late, 
so we will have to see.  Another 
disappointment was the dealership we 
went to.  The sales staff was not as 
knowledgeable as they should have 
been.  There was much left to be 
desired with the dealership as well.  "
cadillac,sts,2005,ron's cad, 03/03/2007,Ron's Cadillac,4,"This is my first Cadillac.  It is a great handling automobile.  I chose the black color.  It is very good looking, better than a BMW or Mercedes, in my opinion.  The brake performance is excellent, but has a squeal problem. Dealer service has been wonderful so far.  I will buy one again."
cadillac,sts,2005,2005 STS, 06/04/2008,Not For Me,3,"The STS is a sleek, stylish car, but difficult to drive. There are too many complications such as not being able to see out of the back window, when anyone else drives it i.e. my husband, the rear view mirror change direction, but do not change back when I drive, also the radio automatically changes to another station or the disc changes. I do not like not having a key and I do not like the door locks, just to name a few."
cadillac,sts,2005,2005 STS, 07/14/2008,Good looks only!,3,"Our car has been a lemon!  Same tire thump as others reported & tires were replaced after about 4 trips to the dealer.  Tires also after were replaced did not wear well or last long since can not be rotated.  Power steering lines have been replaced.  There was a burping noise coming from vents that was horrible as it sounded like someone was passing gas.  Again after a few trips to dealer, some type of ventilation computer part was replaced.  My car has been in the shop over a dozen times in 2 years. The problems were all ""odd"" and could not be diagnosed easily so there were many return trips.  As other reviews have said when you buy a Cadillac you are not treated as if you buy a Lexus."
cadillac,sts,2005,johnjohn, 01/31/2009,BEST CAR,4,I brought this car used.It is the best car I have ever owned.The looks the ride and comfort are amazing.I have only had to take it in for service.
cadillac,sts,2005,Jason, 02/20/2009,Cadillac: The American dream,4,Had this car for over a year now and it is the best car I have ever owned. AWD is good in the snow and great in the rain. Drives like a dream.
cadillac,sts,2005,ultrastark, 05/30/2009,awesome ultra fine classy car,4,"owning and especially driving this beauty are an absolute pleasure, yea there is the odd glitch here and there such as the interior shud be a bit more prestigous. the 320 hp is awesome they shud have made it a 360hp or so but the 320hp is superfine. sound system is beyond prestige. it handles like a sports car born on the track. what a sweet ride u built it right this time caddy, the headlight and light system mated to the front fascia is a designers showpiece."
cadillac,sts,2005,Rob & Renee in WA, 01/06/2008,Love my 2005 STS,4,"We traded a 2006 Subaru Outback in on this car.  We wanted something larger and better looking and boy did we get it!  Interior is roomy and seats (front and back) are extremely comfortable.  Tons of leg room, even in the back seat.  We like the seperate climate controls, power sunroof, and the automatic driver settings.  This car will adjust the seat and mirror settings for two drivers. It is really neat getting into the car after my husband has used it, and the seats and mirrors are set exactly where I like them.  Trunk is a bit small & the glove box is a joke. Gorgeous exterior and extreme pick up.  Very fast and fun to drive. This is not your grandpa's car!"
cadillac,sts,2005,cindy, 06/24/2009,enjoyed the car,4,"The only problem with this car was the mirror on drivers side had locating problems.This was fixed.otherwise great experience.Put 20s on and looks great.Rough riding due to the low profiles and all the mechanisms in the seats, but wonderful vehicle experience."
cadillac,sts,2005,Grant STS, 12/02/2004,The Standard Of the World,4,"Just took delivery of a beautiful Blue Chip STS 4 and I can only say that it is the most awesome car on the market.  Handling is light and nimble yet the ride is very solid.  Magna ride control really eats up the NYC potholes.  Fit and finish are world class and the interior will make even the strongest critics smile.  Outstanding power, cool features and a kick a@# Bose sound system.  "
cadillac,sts,2005,Robert, 12/04/2004,My 05 STS V-8 with 1sg package,5,The performance of the vehicle is outstanding and transmission shifts so smooth you do not feel it shifting. Exterior and interior fit and finish is is up to par if not better than all other autombiles.
cadillac,sts,2005,Cadillac STS, 12/09/2004,Cadillac Got it Right!,5,With a powerful V8 engine and a suspension and body to handle all that power the STS is a driver's dream. The acceleration has to be experinced to be believed either from a dead stop or from 80 on up it is really fast. The styling is cutting edge for Cadillac with a look that is appealing for young and old with a bold athletic stance that says it is ready to move and move fast. If you are looking for a sedan that looks great inside and out and handles like a sports car a test drive in this beauty is highly recommended.
cadillac,sts,2005,Bigdog63121, 01/13/2005,I Love it!!,5,"Have driven a lot of cars in my 55 years and by far my 2005 Cadillac STS is the best. Not only is it the most fun to drive, it is also the best handling. Plenty of my friends have gone the import route and the ones who have had the chance to ride in, or drive my STS are truly impressed. I gave up a 300 hp Northstar for the 265 hp V6 in this car and have not looked back. I have all the acceleration that I need and I never got up to 150 mph any way!"
cadillac,sts,2005,Dave, 01/30/2005,First Time Cadillac Owner,4,"I'm still getting used to the body style of my 2005 Cadillac STS.  It looks a little bulky for my taste, but that's Cadillac.  The car is set apart from most on the road by it's different looks.  It is full of technology, so you need to enjoy it to enjoy the car."
cadillac,sts,2005,Chris, 02/16/2005,Not ready for prime time,3,"This is my fifth STS.  Great performance and style other than the added spoiler.  Poor fit on the rear doors & trim. Bluetooth phone still not functional, traction contol is disengaged under sport shift - no solution yet.  Various other glitches (remote start did not supply fuel, transmission stumble at low speeds). Trunk is quite bit smaller than the outgoing model.  A potentially great car introduced before it was debugged."
cadillac,sts,2005,Rick, 02/17/2005,05 STS fun To Drive,4,What a beautiful car. Fun to drive. The most quiet car I have ever been in. The power in the V-6 is more than needed. Buyng a V8 would be a waste. Or you just want too much power. You cannot feel the trany shift. Smooth as silk. Just a great car.
cadillac,sts,2005,Carlos Couto, 04/29/2005,My first Cadillac,5,"In my 30 plus years of driving I have driven all makes and some of the best cars in the world including Rolls Royce, and I have never seen a car so confortable, safe and tecnicaly advanced as my new STS. I truly enjoy driving it. Be aware that you lose your privacy, wherever you go people just keep looking at the car and driver (I think I like it). What a great buy I have made. "
cadillac,sts,2005,Jeff D'Amato, 05/11/2005,STS Rocks!,4,"This car is What puts Cadillac over the top. Not soft and old like Lexas. Not hard, business like and ugly like the new BMW's. By far the best stereo system in any car at any price.The STS Rocks!"
cadillac,sts,2005,caddy4life, 05/15/2005,Great vehicle,5,This car is awesome. it looks amazing driving down the street. I even got a complement from a Mercedes owner. The STS drives great and I love the cruise control that slows down when you get too close to another car. The heated/cooled seats are great for any weather. The navigation screen is big and easy to see even when the sun is out by moving the screen back and forth.
cadillac,sts,2005,BaltoMan, 05/15/2005,Great American Car,5,"I looked at all the competitors - BMW 5 series, MB 300's, Lexus 300's, Acura TL and RL, Audi, and Infiniti M35/45. The Cadillac has edgier styling, better or as good as interior than all but Audi (BMW was pitiful).  It also has better build and reliability than the European cars, more fun and masculine than Lexus or Acura. Only the Infiniti was close. It has more toys for the money and the option packages made more sense. But the STS is stylish, roomy, confortable and a great drive. Best of all, it's made in America. "
cadillac,sts,2005,Aboody, 06/02/2005,Standard of the World,5,"Cadillac is definetly back in the game with this new STS. From the great looks to the great interior, to superior technology. I have had the car for two months and its great. No problem at all. This is the third Cadillac to be part of our family, and every year they keep on getting better. They have all been great, and no problems at all. Cadillac has really silenced the streotypes. If your looking for a car make sure to test this one out. It blows away all the other midsize cars, whether it be BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Infiniti, or Jaguar.  Excellent Car, worth every penny, as were all the other Cadillacs we have. Why settle for anything but the standard of the World?"
cadillac,sts,2005,Fernando, 06/25/2005,Cadillac STS,4,"I really like this car, is fun to drive, the style is nice. Delivers performance when needed. The gadgets are amazing, the keyless entry is my favorite, but I also like the Onstar equipped phone and the transmission switch. Is a nice car."
cadillac,sts,2005,Cary L, 06/27/2005,Great American Car!!!,4,"Originally went to purchase a CTS Luxury Sport but the salesman also showed us a V6 STS Luxury pkg. For a few dollars more my wife and I got exactly what we were both looking for. I have been looking at both Japanese and European cars for the past 3 months and the STS V6 beats them all! The V6 is the perfect engine at 255 HP, coupled with a 5 speed auto trans that has sport mode as well as a manual shift option, this car not only looks great it's a blast to drive. Center stack with optional Premium upgrade gets wood trim, which makes this interior gorgeous! If thats not enough, it runs on regular gas, something all the imports can't do.  Also remember it is rear wheel drive, so no torque steer."
cadillac,sts,2005,J.Stiles, 06/29/2005,Traded a Town Car,4,Fun Car! The seats a little hard. Two faults: trunk very limited and glove box stinks. Missing some things that we were used to: auto trunk close; hidden accesory plug for radar detect or phone that closes down with ignition. Overload on computorized settings. (my wife is still scared to touch )
cadillac,sts,2005,nick moscato, 07/27/2005,Best Cadillac I Ever Owned,5,"I have owned Cadillacs from 1980 till now, my '92 was the best looking coupe but this car is the best handling car in any weather, its easy to drive more than enough power with the V6 takes regular gas. This car is fun to drive. The nav system is great, I cannot find anything wrong with this car, look fit comfort are great. Thanks Cadillac for creating a beautiful and stealhty looking vehicle."
cadillac,sts,2005,Joe, 07/27/2005,Great Car to Own,5,This is my first Cadillac and is the best car I ever purchased.  It is fun to drive and is loaded with technology. The white diamond paint with cashmere interior draws attention. Kudos to GM's Cadillac Division.
cadillac,sts,2005,P SII, 07/27/2005,Best Built Luxury Vehicle that I've Owned,5,I've had the Audi A8 and the Mercedes E-Class and by far I must say that the new STS is by far the best to drive and it handles on a dime.  I was merely impressed to see that GM has gotten a vechicle to play with those that others claim to be the best in this class.
cadillac,sts,2005,PeteB, 08/12/2005,Great Car,5,"This STS is a great car!  The STS drives so smoothly, with all the power and handling that you would expect in a luxury car.  I have owned a lot of cars and this is one of the best.  The STS has best balance between ride and handling over the competition.  I agree with Edmunds.com's Editors best picks for 2005.  I would never have probably looked at a Cadillac without the excellent reviews.  I look for opportunities to drive this car!  I think that the rear seat comfort could be improved though, but other than that I have no complaints so far!  Also, received a great deal on a great car!"
cadillac,sts,2005,gordon petry, 08/30/2005,2005 Cadillac STS,4,We have had our 2005 Cadillac STS for less than two months but so far really love it except for the small glove box.  This is our fourth one and we really love it.  We had some problems with the carpet but my dealer and Cadillac renewed it. We hope to buy another one in a couple of years.
cadillac,sts,2005,pres, 01/09/2006,Combination of Luxury and Performance,4,"The 2005 Cadillac STS is an excellent blend of comfort and performance.  It has good power, road manners, a good feel for the road, and handling.  It's adroit yet comfortable. The appearance of this car is sharp, but with a rich look."
cadillac,sts,2005,Chris, 07/13/2006,Transmission!,3,"My STS' transmission is awful!  When downshifting, it has trouble finding a gear, especially when you want to re-accelerate.  It makes for a very rough ride.  At speed, it's okay.  Also, its voice recognition is poor.  The electronics are too complicated, too.  The learning curve is fairly steep. I also don't like the adaptive cruise control. Bluetooth is a joke as well."
cadillac,sts,2005,STS Car guy, 09/20/2004,STS - MORE CAR THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE,4,"Forget the negative comments. This car 
has all the great features you will 
ever want in an automobile. It's fast 
enough, rides comfortably, and comes 
with all the bells and whistles. The 
1SF I drive makes the 03 Infinity Q45 
I traded seem like just another car. 
With only 300 miles it's hard to find 
any faults. All the technology becomes 
overwhelming when you are trying to 
learn it all at one time, but the fun 
is discovering new things this car will 
do everyday. Going back to a car 
without keyless entry, 5.1 surround 
sound, advanced navigation, intelligent 
headlights, rainsence wipers, heads up 
display, in a perfectly designed 
cockpit will be impossible."
cadillac,sts,2005,Sir Drive Alot, 09/29/2004,BMW who?,5,"This is a fantastic ride. Great power, 
interior sound, and build quality. It 
accelerates like a rocket. the Bose 
sound system is the best. The nav 
system is easy to use, well alot easier 
than BMW's I-drive. I did not buy the 
active suspension because I could not 
tell the difference with my driving. I 
tried the V-6 but no way, not enough 
uumf."

cadillac,sts,2005,yolan carter, 10/02/2004,The Kat Rides,5,"Sporty exterior and great funky army 
green color. Great pickup.  This is my 
5th Cadi and first not a Deville model. 
Takes some getting used to because it 
is smaller than the full size Deville.  
Burns regular gas which is why I 
switched models.  Engine is made in 
France but it appears to be splendid so 
I'll forgive them for that. 
I miss the huge trunck of the Deville 
but the back seats fold down so I have 
a huge trunck provided there are  no 
passengers in the rear. I like the 
smaller size because it is easier to 
handle, parking is a breeze.  The only 
drawback I can find is one does not get 
the soft ride of the large Deville. 
This is a ""sport"" ride"

This is absolutely the finest vehicle
I've ever owned.

From the DVD audio with Bose 5.1
surround sound to the keyless
EVERYTHING! (I'm still trying to figure
out what to do with my keys!)

Bluetooth phone, DVD, all features
exceptional.  They obviously took cues
from import luxury cars but ""tweeked""
the options to be more user friendly.

Handling, ride, suspension - all
incredible.  I feel as though this car
was designed specifically for me!

Gas mileage is not-so-great as a barrel
of oil hits 55.00 but it's not like a
surprise with a 255 HP  V-6.

Get down to your Cadillac dealer!  You
gotta drive this car!"

cadillac,sts,2005,Ira d, 12/22/2004,CADDY HAS FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT!,4,"I HAVE JUST PURCHASED MY STS WITH THE 
G PACKAGE AND I HAVE THE CAR FOR A 
TOTAL OF 700 SO FAR. I HAVE TO SAY 
THAT THIS CAR IS EVERYTHING YOU COULD 
ASK FOR IN A LUXURY CAR. I LOVE THE 
ALL AROUND PERFORMANCE AND IT 
DISTINCTIVE APPEARANCE. THE ""G"" HAS TO 
BE ORDERED, BUT IT IS WELL WORTH THE 
WAIT. THE CAR LOOKS MUCH BETTER WITH 
THE 18 INCH WHEELS. ALL I CAN SAY IS 
THAT IT IS A CREDIBLE RIVAL FOR BMW 
AND MERCEDES, AND SHOULD BE ON 
EVERYONE'S LIST.
THE GAS MILEAGE COULD BE BETTER, 
HOWEVER, BUT OVERALL, ""WOW"" IS THE 
BEST ADJECTIVE TO USE!!"
cadillac,sts,2005,Ron Lessley, 12/24/2004,Owner's Manual gibberish,3,"The Owner's Manual is not user 
friendly. It took two Tech reps two
hours to program the features, so how
does GM expect the buyer to utilize the
gibberish that passes for a manual.
Just to use the CD, reading the manual
is useless -you have to sit in the car
and press buttons at random to get this
feature going. Where is the user guides
(photos, VHS) that came with the old 
STS? When that's all done, the glove
compartment is too small to hold any-
thing more than a pair of gloves and
all the other compartments are too 
skimpy to be of any use. The time 
display (clock) is too small unless you
like squinting to read the numerals.
Apart from poor GM design on important
utilities?"
cadillac,sts,2005,JOE REDDEN, 12/30/2004,2005 Cadillac STS,5,"My '05 Cadillac STS is a pleasure to drive.
Its exterior styling is unique, and looks great.
The fit and finish of both the exterior and 
interior is fine. The interior noise level is 
almost nonexistant. This is a great truck 
in all respects."
cadillac,sts,2005,Hyman Arbesfeld, 01/01/2005,This is My 6TH Cadillac STS and its the Best Yet,4,"The exterior of the Cadillac STS is unmatched by
any vehicle being sold by Lexus, Mercedes-Benz
or BMW, all of which are too bland for my taste.
This really is a car that you can enjoy
looking at.

Not having to use a key for all that a
key is normally used I have found very
interesting.  I have to educate others
about this when i leave the car with
parking attendants."

decided to switch to something different

style.  I chose Cadillac STS because it
is a prestige car that is absolutely
gorgeous.  I am very pleased with it.  I
have had it for only two weeks and am
still learning about special features."

owned. I never drove one until the day 
that I went to my local Cadillac 
Dealer. I was looking at the CTS but 
was disappointed by its economy 
looking interior. I saw the STS and I 
fell in love with the car. It has 
style and appeal I was looking for. 
Along with the value. "
cadillac,sts,2005,bill james, 01/15/2005,Review - 2005 Cadillac STS,5,My 2005 Cadillac STS is fun to drive.  Its power is there when it is needed.  It has a very quiet ride. It also has a roomy interior and easy access when getting in and out.  The option of automatic or manual shifting also make it a blast to drive.
cadillac,sts,2005,BMW fan, 01/16/2005,Unbelievable and Remarkable vehicle,5,"My 2005 Cadillac STS is an unbelievable car.  The handling, ride, and power are better than BMW, Lexus, Mercedes or any other import car. I test drove a Lexus LS 430 right before the Cadillac STS and the ride quality was exactly the same, which really surprised me. Its almost as if GM duplicated the ride quality. "
cadillac,sts,2005,Robert Stephens, 01/20/2005,What a Cadillac,5,First of all I love the keyless entry system in the 2005 Cadillac STS.  When you sit behind the wheel you can feel the room and see the beauty of the interior. I just love the real wood in the dash. Though this car is a V6 it has as much power as my 1984 Chevrolet Corvette. It really has the Cadillac ride which no car maker can match. It is fun to drive.
cadillac,sts,2005,Senior Male, 01/25/2005,Cadillac gets back to great cars,4,"I traded a 1993 Lexus LS400, which was purchased new and was a terrific car.  My new Cadillac STS is quicker, faster, more secure on the road, and a lot more fun to drive.  The shifter provides control just like a manual transmmission.  I love all the autumatic goodies. In just a few weeks the car became a very accomodating good friend."
cadillac,sts,2005,kg55, 01/26/2005,2005 Cadillac STS,4,"My 2005 Cadillac STS rides like a dream!  It is tight, smooth and quiet.  Its standard features were enough, but with just the V6 Luxury Equipment Group and Premium Upgrade Package, I have more creature comforts than I have ever had!  There has been no wind noise and it handles the bumps as well as any foreign luxury car.  I look forward to the ride to and from work!"
cadillac,sts,2005,Nice, 01/27/2005,Nice Car!,4,"The 2005 Cadillac STS is a wonderful combination of comfort and performance. It provides a reasonable alternative to BMW , Lexus and Mercedes-Benz."
cadillac,sts,2005,DG1, 02/09/2005,"""The"" Car to Have ...",5,"I have owned the AWD Cadillac STS for about three months and 5,000 miles.  It is down right fantastic!  The car performs even better then it looks.  The interior is beautiful and several steps up from my previous CTS.  Anyone looking for the best all around car in the world should simply start looking at your nearest Cadillac dealer.  If you bring your checkbook, you will want to buy the STS ."
cadillac,sts,2005,Samuel Halter, 02/09/2005,I'm impressed with my new STS,4,"My Cadillac STS is very new, but so far, I'm impressed. The sound system, HUD, OnStar, keyless entry/starting, 18 inch wheels and XM radio are outstanding features.  The car also looks great."
cadillac,sts,2005,PMS, 03/05/2005,Former Import Loyalist,5,"I must say that I have been a loyal import consumer until I looked at the Cadillac STS. After extensive research and test driving, I fell in love with my new STS. The interior, drive, performance and comfort could not be duplicated for the price. It has awesome technology. So far it's been a pleasure to own."
cadillac,sts,2005,keith duggan, 03/12/2005,great car,4,"Great handling and great pickup when passing other vehicles. This car demands to be driven. The ride is unbelivable, it's the first car my wife has been able to sleep in while on a trip. Great job Cadillac!"
cadillac,sts,2005,Belinda Mitchell, 03/12/2005,STS,4,"It's a wonderful vehicle.  I have the rear wheel drive vehicle and the performance in the snow is still good. It is excellent in rainy weather. Cadillac's traction control makes up about for the lack of all wheel drive.  But, if you drive in heavy snow go for the all wheel drive."
cadillac,sts,2005,swirls, 03/12/2005,I love my STS!,5,it's a solid vehicle with lots of bells and whistles. The adaptability of the vehicle to my needs is superb. All of the instruments are within reach and plainly displayed with out being striking or obvious. This car has real presence with a stylishness that is classic and  not trendy. I also received a wealth of information to further enhance my Cadillac experience. I encourgage anyone who is curious to give this one a spin. You'll be hooked!
cadillac,sts,2005,tark, 03/19/2005,Awesome remake of this vehicle,5,I am so pleased with the remake of this car.  It is a huge improvement over the previous models.  This is the most fun car I have ever driven and I rent vehicles weekly in my travels.  Highly recommended.
cadillac,sts,2005,2005 Cadillac STS, 03/22/2005,My 10th Cadillac,3,"I have been through them all and find this car to be the most disappointing of all.  I miss the auto brake release, the fuel tank release, the easy to close trunk etc etc..guess I am spoiled..but I do love the XM radio.. I had a problem with the keyless entry system but hopefully they have figured it out. Bring back the real Seville."
cadillac,sts,2005,Papabal, 03/24/2005,"STS,nice but bland",3,"My V6 STS rides, handles and generally feels better than the 2003 Seville V8 STS it replaced and so far seems screwed together loads better than any previous GM I've owned.  But the styling outside and inside seems too bland.  Designers seem to like the plain, trimless body sides these days (probably cheaper too), but on this car, like many others (BMW etc) there is too much flat sheet metal from window sill to rocker that will only attract dings and chips which will be accentuated by the flat expanse.  On the inside, the voice navigation system really needs work and I defy someone to find the clock when stuff is turned on. Room could be better on such a large car.  "
cadillac,sts,2005,hrsavage, 04/06/2005,I love my STS,5,"Over a 50 year span, my new STS is my 47th car and without doubt it is the best one I have owned. Its' handling and all out drivability surpass anything I have ever driven, including 8 Mercedes and 3 Porsches, even a Lotus. And at 75 mph, it gets 24 miles to the gallon. Cadillac is again the standard of the world. All this for $50,000. Imagine!"
cadillac,sts,2005,Mrs. R M Wheeler, 04/22/2005,On the road again,5,"We traded 2002 DeVille in after test driving our STS 2005 Northstar V8.  We test drove a Jaguar and a Mercedes a few months back.  We weren't in the market to really purchase a new car, but after driving the STS, we were sold.  Handles like a dream, drives true and is really fun to drive.  I am so lucky my husband who has is a car buff from way back, said he wouldn't consider the V6.  When the salesman rode with us in the V8, he said it did have a little more pep than the V6!  Beautifully done car, inside and out. Cadillac has a winner and so do we."
cadillac,sts,2005,csquare, 04/24/2005,Luxury and fun car,4,Well designed and makes driving a pleasure. The engineers really gave a lot of thought to this design.  It is ergonomically correct!
cadillac,sts,2005,L.Englander, 05/07/2005,They did Good,4,I like the looks and performance and I got the car loaded with just about every piece of optional equipment. It's nice to have people stare and compliment me on the car and maybe some day I'll figure out how to use all the gadgets.
cadillac,sts,2005,shawnbi, 05/21/2005,STS AWD,5,I love this car. What a amazing ride. Outstanding technology inside the vehicle for a great experience. Better then BMW and Audi hands down. I still can't believe how awesome this car is. Cadillac has its own unique feel which I applaud them for!
cadillac,sts,2005,FLYONS, 05/22/2005,Great car,5,"Great car, love to drive it. Best car I've ever driven. Quiet, great ride. I like the handling on back roads. Fuel mileage is good, not great. Love the Bose sound system. The V6 has plenty of power."
cadillac,sts,2005,dracula, 06/20/2005,My first Cadillac,4,"I have always bought Buicks but this year I decided to upgrade to Cadillac. The STS ads got my attention and since I only buy American cars, I was sold. So far so good. I looked at the Lucerne but I did not like the name nor the improvements since I bought my 2000 LeSabre Limited. "
cadillac,sts,2005,Ron Lessley, 07/01/2005,Peppy STS Beats the Old Seville,3,"Trying to program the memory features was a real chore. It took 2 dealer techs 2 hours to get the job done. The old Seville came with VHS instructional tape and a handy card. This new STS is not user friendly in that respect. The glove compartment is next to useless, being so shallow and the return of standard cigarette lighters and ash trays is not a welcome addition. The buyer gets more ""toys"" than he can keep track of, so eventually forgets all but the most used features. The tires and brakes could be a little more high-performance but are only adequate as they come from the factory. The coffee cup holders have only one purpose: to hold coffee cups. "
cadillac,sts,2005,Dianne Adams, 07/11/2005,Consumer Rating for Cadillac STS,5,"This vehicle is in one word awesome.  You have to drive one to believe the  over all performance, comfort and whatever you would ever dream of having in a car. I have owned a few Cadillac's, they were all wonderful cars but nothing like this one. Competitors can't touch this one.  I love my STS."
cadillac,sts,2005,FrmrBMWguy, 07/30/2005,Look at the V6!,5,"I formerly have driven BMW's for the past decade. The price on the new 7-Series has gotten a little pricey, so I looked at alternatives.  For the money, I could not have found a better drive.  I tested the V8 for a week then the V6.  There is truly NO noticable difference in the performance, and since the majority of my driving is in the city, I would highly recommend the STS V6.  Fully optioned it is priced closely to the base V8. "
cadillac,sts,2005,Ed Durante, 07/30/2005,Outstanding Vehicle,4,"I have only 2,500 miles on this car, but they have been very enjoyable miles. The car is solid, and extremely quiet, except when I have the 15 speaker Bose DVD system cranked up. The power is awsome, and the handling smooth and responsive. This is my fourth consecutive Cadillac in the Seville line. The past vehicles were SLS's and I loved them. I was having mixed emotions turning in my last car which was a 2002 SLS. It only took one test drive of the new STS and I never got into the old car again, and didn't look back. The controls are state of the art and user friendly. From programming the features to using the GPS navigation system. The car is an absolute dream to drive and own."
cadillac,sts,2005,w.j.bridges, 08/20/2005,Happy choice to replace Acura TLs,4,"The Cadillac STS is a great road car.  Fuel mileage (overall) 21 mpg but engine not yet broken in with 1,000 miles.  Leather seats could be softer but quality is good.  Only dissatisfaction is with glove box which is rediculously designed and much too small.  Good storage between seats helps.  Previous 3 cars were Acura TLs which were great cars, but just as satisfied with STS. "
cadillac,sts,2005,Batman, 09/04/2005,The Batmobile,4,"Fantastic car with tons of cool gizmos and gadgets that are so fun to play with. Great power with the V8, and handling with the magnetic suspension is the best that I have driven. I really like the remote start, cools it down inside. If only it would come pick me up. The black exterior and the chrome lines make it my little Batmoblie."
cadillac,sts,2005,jclarkeusa, 09/17/2005,Front End Problems,3,"My 2005 Cadillac STS is a nice car but the front end rattles excessively at speeds of 35 MPH or under.  To date, Cadillac has been unable to fix the problem.  So far, they have replaced a control arm but that still has not fixed the problem.  If I had it to do over again I would have purchased the Infinit M35 or BMW 530i.  This will be the last time I buy an American luxury car!"
cadillac,sts,2005,Frank Maiese, 10/04/2005,Fourth One,4,"This is my fourth Cadillac. The only thing I miss is the floatly driving of the big Cadillacs, other then that it is a great car. I like the way it handles going around curves.  If you go a little too fast it brakes itself and slows down to a safer speed.  "
cadillac,sts,2005,jhutchinson1, 01/31/2006,Cadillac STS,3,"I love the look and feel of this car, however the engine and steering column have already been replaced before it hit 6,000 miles.  The parts were not in stock, resulting in 37 days repair time the first time and 39 the second.  I am in the process of a buyback now!"
cadillac,sts,2005,The white streak!, 05/10/2006,Satisfied Customer,4,"I really enjoy the vehicle and love the look and feel!  I have experienced squeeking in my breaks though.  All of the interior features are generally wonderful.  It can be difficult to get into the vehicle, but overall the ride and feel are wonderful!  I have had many had many people comment on the look of the car and most people are in love with it!  "
cadillac,sts,2005,Arturo, 06/26/2006,Switched,4,"I had to have the the fuel tank in my '05 STS replaced, the fuel gauage repaired, and replaced the main module that controls the memory.  I was informed after purchase that the DRL will not function if you opt to engage the auto rain sensing wipers even if the manual indicates that you can."
cadillac,sts,2005,rick simon, 07/29/2006,Disapointment,3,"I am really disapointed that a $60,000 car is so poorly built.  What's worse is that Cadillac customer care was rude and told me that there is nothing they are willing to do to fix it.  The Bluetooth connection is a joke, the people on the other end say you sound like you are in a cave and are hard to hear.  The car has a wind leak in the passenger door.  We even traced the location and told the dealer where it was located.  Twice and they still can't fix it.  The tires are low profile Michelins. One tire has a thump in it which is noticible at low speeds.  Guess what, no problem found!  I have always been an American auto owner, but this car is screaming ""trade me for a Beemer!"""
cadillac,sts,2005,Mark Moran, 08/10/2006,The Most Car for the Money,4,"The car rides somewhere between a Lexus and a BMW.  It is firm and responsive, especially in sport driving mode (or manual shifting) with the performance transmission setting.  It really zips along. "
cadillac,sts,2005,J.Stiles, 10/26/2006,Tires,4,"At 10,000 miles my STS developed a thumping noise, which was especially noisy at low speed.  Our dealer diagnosed this as a tire problem and replaced (free of charge) our front tires. The noise dissipated to almost nothing, it is but still noticeable in the rear tires. I was a little surprised that the dealer charged us for a full alignment on the new tires."
cadillac,sts,2005,large sedan, 12/16/2006,Cadillac is the Best,5,"My miles have been - 33% city, 33% 300 mile trips, and 33% long trips. Around town I ave between getting 20 to 21 mpg. On the 300 mile trips I ave 24 mpg, and on long trips I avg. 25 mpg.  With 36,000 miles and counting I have not had any problems requiring service.  This is my second Cadillac, after two Buicks. I will trade it in for another Cadillac at 70,000 to 90,000 miles.  My experience with the dealer has been tremendous. They pick up and return my car for service. They offer a ride if I drop off the car for oil changes. When I go for an oil change I make an appointment and wait in a plush waiting room with hot coffee and pastries available for ""free."""
cadillac,sts,2005,gojo2, 03/15/2007,STS Brakes and Front End,3,Our 2005 Cadillac STS is not as reliable as the Lexus' we've owned.  We've had problems with the brakes and the front end.  The dealer and Cadillac are not as friendly to customers as they claim.
cadillac,sts,2005,BenjaminSimon, 04/03/2007,Standard of the World: 2005 STS V8 1SG,4,"I may only be 24 but this Caddy is one of the finest cars I have even been in. Sure a 7 series or S class is better, but I cannot afford those. I like how heads turn when I drive by. I have every factory option and I would have it no other way. I live in the south, so AWD is something that I did not want. AWD hurts both performance and gas mileage. Instead I got performance handling package. (It was a either/or option with AWD) The gas mileage is very average, but I did not buy this car to save money on gas. The MSRP was $63K+ and I would suggest buying used. I got mine 10 months old with 15K and saved huge money. Only been in the shop for software updates. Best value on the road for under $65K "
cadillac,sts,2005,Caddy Lover, 04/17/2008,A Keeper,4,"Great in almost every way. Thought it was me, at 70, turning the chicks head, but turns out it's the Red Line Red color.  Guys if you're looking for women, forget e-harmony.com, get a '05 STS Red Line Red. Sleek in every way.Sorry i didn't buy the AWD."
cadillac,sts,2005,Barbara Janina, 08/30/2020,BLACK PANTHER,5,"My STS4 is called THE BLACK PANTHER because she is black (of course) and she gives the driver the feeling that she just wants to let loose and run fast and sleek.  Her impression is very aggressive and she is.  She has the 2nd generation NorthStar engine and its mated with a fantastic 5 speed with overdrive transmission with instant response.  I can drive her the usual way, move the shifter to the right and she'll hold each gear to the maximum rpm before shifting or i can move further to the right and I can shift the gears myself.  I can also change the suspension between touring and performance mode.  She is considered a sport sedan and was built to compete with her European counterparts.  In fact she beats all of them off the line in 0 to 60.  Punch it and instant response and are pushed back into your seat at a force of .83 g's.  Love also the comfort and luxury inside.  She's elegant, head turning, powerful, fun to drive, does well at car shows and is extremely dependable. I own a 95 Cadillac ETC  with the 1st generation NorthStar engine.  I love it so much that when I retired her to show only, I wanted another Cadillac and definitely with a NorthStar engine.  I found it in my STS4.   I was lucky enough to find the rare STS4 with not only the NorthStar but with the 1SG package.  There were only 1,000 built.  Its a suspension, brake and performance package.  Ive got the premiere wheels which I discovered is also rare.  This is a car I will also not let go except when shes old enough to being another show only car. My car is not red.  My car is all wheel drive as the 4 in STS4 denotes.

It is a V6 and has enough power. I am partial to caddy's. My first car was a 1970 sedan deville. I should have purchased the all wheel drive for I live up north and the car is terrible in the snow. I currently have 114,000 miles on it with no problems. i change the oil every 3,000 miles. I am looking forward to reaching 200,000 miles. "
cadillac,sts,2006,Michael Forman, 03/27/2016,Dude. Yes.,5,"Finally got my grubby paws on a V8 STS, after a year of searching high and low on the intertubes. Perfect color (black), low miles (50k), prior owner babied her like the creampuff that she is, and great price ($12k). I can only assume that the general snobbiness of the American car buying public keeps prices so affordable for such a monstrous performance car. I say, danke schoen to you, BMW owners. My new beauty's Northstar absolutely GROWLS. So throaty and wonderful. I do hereby solemnly swear that (if I can afford to) I will be a Cadillac owner for the rest of my days on this mortal coil.

If you, dear reader, take any advice from all this...it's worth the wait for the V8. Put that on a bumper sticker.

These are repairs I would not expect before 100,000 miles."
cadillac,sts,2006,darkmatter, 05/28/2013,"Cadillac Delivers Excellence, GM does not.",4,"I purchased my 3.6L v6 STS fully loaded for $10,000 after my previous Cadillac, a 2000 Deville DHS, was totaled from hail damage. I needed to get a new car quickly, and I had my first Cadillac for so long with no issues; I wanted to stick to the brand. When I first sat in the vehicle the overwhelming number of ""intuitive"" features was extremely intimidating. Overtime, they grew on me, and the immense customization became a tool from the vehicle to optimize a perfect driving experience. However, with all the great number of features and beautiful styling of the car I found it was easy to overlook the mechanics. One week after I purchased the vehicle, I noticed a ""clicking"" noise. Continued:"
cadillac,sts,2006,J Scott, 03/09/2007,Satisfied Customer,4,I've only had my STS for two months.  I read the reviews here before buying it and I am very pleased with my decision to buy the 2006 STS.  It is more of a sports car than I expected.  The V6 engine has plenty of power for the car.  I got it loaded and I am enjoying it very much. I think any complaints you may read here are overblown. You will be glad you bought this car. I just can't comment about the long term reliability because I have only owned it for two months.  Its fuel economy has been 23 mpg highway / 14 mpg city.

Using the oil recommended by Cadillac which is Mobil One-5w30. No signs of oil leaks, no smoke out of the exhaust pipe.  Cadillac drive OK if you don't mind the popping sound in the driver seat when turning corners.  Also, sometime the lights in the dash below the speedo/tach go out.  Our third Calillac, the last two had electrical problems.  After 8 years with Cadillac, this will be our last one.   "
cadillac,sts,2006,stser, 08/11/2014,Best Car We Ever Drove,4,"Bought new in June 2006 for my wife and two middle school boys. Boys are grown and gone, but car is still excellent. 108,000 miles and counting. Lots of short cold winter starts which can really wear on an engine, but no problems. Used synthetic oil and changed only every 10,000 miles. Ash tray covers (f&b) both broke off, and the bushings in the front suspension have moved out of place so we do get some clunking noises over bumps. Both headlamps burned out within months of each other and were costly to replace because the whole front end had to come off. On third set of tires, otherwise no issues. If looking at used...I would buy my car again. Hope to keep it another 100,000 miles. Good GM!"
cadillac,sts,2006,KSMYSTS, 08/23/2010,The Good Outweighs the Bad,4,"This is my 3rd Cadillac, and my second STS.  The new design definitely tops my former Seville STS.  It is a very fun car to drive, and has lots of power at any speed, without using Sport/Manual mode.  Sure there are things I would change and things that aren't fantastic (like any car), but the good makes those easy to overlook.  The styling with traditional Cadillac cues is a win for me, and I love all the bells and whistles - after all, this is a Cadillac. I feel great driving it, a very responsive car - it is difficult to find performance and luxury in the same package, but this is an example of it."
cadillac,sts,2006,My last GM, 04/27/2019,Not bad but not great,3,"Traded in my 1998 deville for a 2006 STS 3.6 with 86,000 miles. It was flawless for the first year of ownership. Around 96,000 miles I got a misfire and ended up doing the spark plugs. Order the parts online and do it yourself, takes some time but a huge money savor. Didn’t really experience any issues until 140,000 miles then it was all down hill. Transmission became clunky shifting from reverse to drive or when coming to a stop and then accelerating again. LED taillights will fail one bulb at a time but you have to replace the entire assembly. Keyless entry will fail. Interior chrome door handles peeled and will cut you if the wind takes the door out of your hand. Gas mileage for a v6 is poor, I drive both city and highway and generally averaged 19mpg. Horrible in the Michigan snow, I’ve always had Michelin tires and if you are under 5/32 tread they are now useless. Owners Manuel says you’ll burn a quart every 1200 miles. By the end I was burning a quart and a half per tank of gas. Sealed for life transmission is a lie, got the a code reading “transmission fluid deteriorating ”. If your key fob battery is starting to die change the battery right away I waited and was locked out of my car. The Bose stereo sounds great, handling was great, looks a bit sleeker than the CTS. Developed more misfires and oxygen sensors failing in the last 4 months of ownership. Made it to 167,000 miles and traded it in for a Lexus LS430. Basically if your considering this car get the V8 and expect stupid things to go wrong.

cadillac,sts,2006,Jeff, 06/10/2006,Never again,1,"I thought this car would be fun and practical. I have the STS 4, all wheel drive. I have owned it for 7 months and have already made four trips to the dealer and the issues are still not corrected. I have had on-going problems with the all wheel drive and leaks, seals, etc. It has excessive wind noise (which is a a joke for a $60,000 car, my Honda is much quieter). My car has a horrible issue with its acceleration / transmission and the engine nearly seeming to stall out when I want to accelarate on turns and corners. It has a poor HVAC system. It would take a librarian 6 weeks of reading to figure out all the electronics on the car and how to use them. The interior is way too small.  Plus there is no back seat space. I am not happy."
cadillac,sts,2006,Jordan, 09/03/2010,Love My Caddy,4,"I purchased this car certified used with 34,000 on it.  So far I love the Caddy.  I traded in my 2002 Lexus GS300 due to a series of electrical issues. I wanted to buy luxury and AMERICAN so I went with the STS V6. This car is a weekend driver for me as I have a company car. So far I have had it in for warranty service 3 times. The window switch in the back seat went out (roll down but not up), the ashtray trim piece broke, and the selector switch for the power mirrors broke. All under warranty. The technology in this car rivals my Dad's E350 and will out perform the Mercedes all day. It is American and has some squeaks now and then but overall a dream to drive and turns heads. Love this car"
cadillac,sts,2006,Garry, 12/19/2006,2006 STS Bad Brakes?,4,"For 20 months and 18,000 miles I have considered my 2006 STS the best car I've owned. It is truly great road car, and just plain fun to own.  Today I went in for regular maintenance, my dealer informed me that the car required new front pads and rotors, $900!  He went as far as to say all CTS and STS have ""soft"" brakes and I can expect to repeat today's expense every 18,000 to 20,000 miles.  My disappointment is profound."
cadillac,sts,2006,"""S"" Man", 12/30/2006,Awesome STS,5,I bought this car in November and so far it is great! I love just about everything this car has to offer. The ride is very quiet and the 6-cylinder engine offers a lot of pep - there really is no need for the V8 and the additional cost that goes with it! The interior is top notch and it has all the features you could ask for. I have received a lot of positive comments on this car! 
cadillac,sts,2006,Former Caddy Man, 03/18/2007,Fails to Meet Expecations,2,"This car has lots of promise, but fails to deliver.  The quality of the car itself as well as the dealer service has been very poor in my experience.  I have experienced a number of breakdowns requiring tows.  It has had repeated problems and the dealer has not been able to resolve them.  This should not occur with a car like this.  The transmission is rough and uncertain at low speeds and the electronics either don't work as billed or don't work as designed."
cadillac,sts,2006,kinlease, 07/10/2005,The Lean Machine,5,"I am not embarrassed to be behind the wheel of this powerful, technolgically advanced Cadillac.  I personally have a Jaguar and Mercedes, and only went foreign in 1996, as I tried to give my business to the American manufacturer.  This car is fabulous!  The features are great.  They could have made the exterior different than the CTS.  I think of it as a larger CTS, which is a mistake, and a bit masculine."
cadillac,sts,2006,Mark McNulty, 07/27/2006,Great Car,5,"This car is fun to drive and has all the latest technology.   Keyless entry, push button start,  and voice controls - for windows, radio, AC.  It has virtual advisor, which gives me current weather condtions, stock reports and traffic accidents and construction sites to avoid.   I really love this car!   I had a 2005 Cadillac STS with a V6 engine, but traded this in for a 2006 STS V8 with navigation an all the toys.   "
cadillac,sts,2006,Simon Li, 08/18/2006,One Smart Choice for Luxury,4,"This car has a very comfortable ride and a feel of luxury from outside to inside. The style is not just for the 40+ age group any more and the GMAC Smart-Buy program made my decision easier to make. I got the V6 model, it is not as sporty as V8. Overall, it makes my drive to work a lot more enjoyable, even Monday morning."
cadillac,sts,2006,Aurora5000, 10/05/2006,2006 STS,4,This is a great full-size car at a midsize price.  It has a nimble road feel and a powerful V8 engine.  I like its clean lines on the outside and lots of leather and wood trim in the inside. It gives others an impression of quality and luxury. Attention was given to reducing road noise. Its ride is somewhere between the CTS (stiff) and DeVille (soft).
cadillac,sts,2006,Va rider, 10/30/2009,Glad I bought it used,3,"have read many reviews.  I agree:  a little firmer than my 2001 SLS.  Not used to bumpier ride.  Mileage is 13 in town and 19 on the road with hi test and Cad recommended fuel (Texaco).  I test drove an 80,000 mile BMW 750i before and much nicer and same price.  Retails for $101K now but an STS V-8 is easily $68K.  Next time or next car: AWD"
cadillac,sts,2006,Martin, 08/19/2010,Engine Trouble After 3 years,2,"I bought my 06 STS after owning a volvo for 14 years.  Never had to replace the motor or transmission.  I thought I was going to own this car for a number of years without major problems.  Wrong! In the shop now with engine problem.  The price keeps going up just to identify what's wrong. Paid too much money to have problems so soon. I am now wondering if I made a mistake in purchasing this car.  I thought this would be the car that would take me into retirement.  It's a good looking car, but it has it's down falls such as useless glove compartment, limited storage space in doors, small truck for a med size nice looking car, noisy, and limited room in the back seats. "
cadillac,sts,2006,I Bought What???, 04/01/2009,Don't Buy This Car - At least the 2006,4,"I purchased a Certified 2006 STS w/ 20,000 miles in July 2008.   Excellent condition. I traded my Toyota Solara with no regrets until ... the moaning sounds started.  Forget driving this car on long interstate trips involving mountains. This is the most annoying noise ever. I've had it to the dealer 6 times for repair without any luck.  They claim to ""reprogram"" whatever it is they ""reprogram,"" but it never repairs the problem. I didn't think a car like this with over a $55,000 price tag new would have so many problems. I cannot speak for the V6, but the V8 is not up to par with even the 3.0 V6 in my former vehicle the Solara. I'm ready for another Toyota!  Tell me again why GM is in a mess?"
cadillac,sts,2006,Ike, 05/19/2010,Nice Care,4,"After two year - I'm happy.  Sorry to report that I had to have brakes and rotors replaced @ 43K.  Bought with 16k - so no reason to replace the brakes - tires a still good for another 20k.  Rides nice, all the bells and whistles are cool.  Overall not bad except for the brakes.  Recommend to someone looking for a nice car, great features, and class.  Drove 1100 miles in two day and felt great getting out of the car.  Ave 28 mpg - very good for an AWD, 6 cyl.  I do get a lot of road noise when driving on concrete.  Other then that -  nice."
cadillac,sts,2006,Romiee, 07/09/2010,Not Bad for a used CAR,4,"Bought the caddie STS 06 v8 with 50,000k.  IT was out of warranty though but that didn't bother me. Its a great car and very stylish. I had the CTS 07 2.8l prior and traded that in for a little more luxury. Only paid additional 3,000 for difference. Again great car and very happy. Had small minors repairs like mass air flow sensor replaced and rear brake pads. I do a lot of driving and have already put almost 10,000 miles in 8 months.  This car can go on for a very long time. Just maintain the oil changes every 5,000 or 6,000 miles using synthetic motor oil for the STS v8. Highly Recommend putting Super or premium gasoline in this car for better engine protection and performance. :)"
cadillac,sts,2006,mstewart, 11/21/2005,2005 STS,3,"I have had nothing but trouble with my 2006 Cadillac STS V8 since I took delivery of it. First, the delivery was delayed at the dealership because the entire radio had to be replaced. After the first 1,000 miles, a loud noise like crunching tin cans developed in the front-end. The dealership has attempted to fix it several times without success. I have been waiting on another part for over a week which they hope will remedy the problem. Meanwhile a coil in the engine went out causing it to operate on less than all 8 cylinders. I have communicated with Cadillac customer relations but have gotten absolutly no relief. Buyers beware."
cadillac,sts,2006,JARED LENNTER, 06/18/2006,Vadillac STS - Better than a new BMW or MErcedes,5,"This car rides and handles better than our 2 year old BMW 7-Series.  Its seats, braking, steering, and power ""or a 6-cyl. are unreal. We could not be happier with a car.  I am thankful America is producing strong quality for a reasonable price, $44,000 loaded."
cadillac,sts,2006,Mister Anderson, 07/01/2006,It's Really Here,5,"The mid size luxury sedan that you are looking for is right here in America! Like everyone, I drove the usual suspects Audi, BMW, and Infiniti. The technology that Cadillac has invested in the STS is amazing. 5.1 surround sound, navigation, a true keyless remote, gracious styling and the quietest ride in its class. I sold an '03 Infiniti Coupe and an '05 Infiniti Sedan for the STS. Both are nice cars but the coupe was too loud inside. I have never looked back. Its can cruise at any speed."
cadillac,sts,2006,Gene Remillard, 08/09/2005,Excellent vehicle,4,"Having been a Lincoln owner since 1988, I am impressed with this, my first Cadillac.  The initial reason for the change in vehicles was that I did not have the comfort I expected from the Town Car. The performance I am experiencing is above my expectations, and the comfort level is what I was looking for.  Initially, the gas mileage was a bit lower than expected, but now with 1,600 miles, it has increased to the expected level."
cadillac,sts,2006,lcacsllc, 12/20/2005,The greatest disappointment of Cadillac,3,"I have been driving Cadillacs for the past 16 years.  I have had DeVille's and SLS's.  Always I could rely on Cadillac to provide superior ride and service.  My 2006 STS V6 was a huge disappointment.  We have 8,000 miles on the car and have felt every crack in the road from here to Florida and back.  We cancelled a Christmas driving trip and chose to fly.  The ride is intolerable.  Never before have we had to test drive the car before ordering.  We find that the only smooth ride offered by Cadillac is the DTS.  We like the sporty styling but its a tin-lizzy dressed in sports attire.  Second, the glove box is not sufficient to even house the car's instruction manual.  What a useless piece of space."
cadillac,sts,2006,johnnocalif, 01/15/2006,STS - Ride is VERY FIRM,3,"If you are looking for a soft, luxurious Cadillac-style ride, you won't find it in the STS.  Its bucket seats are pure Mercedes stiff.  I have moved from a 2004 Jaguar S-Type with the Sport Package to a 2006 STS V6 with the Performance Luxury Package.  I love the STS and all the technology. The STS feels more luxurious and larger.  It has great ride, is quiet, and has no road vibration -  but the seats are so firm that it ruins the ride. The lumbar support is too hard and does not fit a 6'2"" body.  The Jag S-Type rides softer on the freeway and tighter winding roads.  I love many things about the STS, but a 1-2 hour drive is all that I can stand."
cadillac,sts,2006,joe casazza, 01/29/2006,My Early Opinion,3,"I just got my 2006 Cadillac STS V8.  While its styling is appealing, the rear seat comfort is very tight.  Also, its quality is not as good as I had expected.  The instructions for the electronics is very confusing.  Even dealer personnel have difficulty due to the use of different systems in different models. The keytless start feature is OK, but not great.  the stereo is fantastic!"
cadillac,sts,2006,Bobb, 06/26/2006,Why doesn't Cadillac Listen!,3,"My new STS is a well built alternative to the off shore crowd.  I find it to be a quiet car with enough power to give it that ""fun""factor."" All in all, I am satisfied with the vehicle. That said, there are many shortcommings with the car that Cadillac never should have allowed to pass. The storage inside the car is just pitiful. The glove box is not large enough to fit my gloves in! The center console is tiny and there is no back seat storage to speak of. But it is the electronics that really sour my opinion of the car. Voice recognition? Not my voice. Want to use your Bluetooth phone? Not while you are moving. Change your destination on the Nav? Have to stop the car! This is simply a stupid design."
cadillac,sts,2006,ADMIN, 07/20/2006,Love it but Cramped,4,"I just bought my first ever Cadillac.  It looks great, drives so smoothly but lacks backseat leg room and has very little storage room.  It is very difficult to get out of, but overall it is luxury through and through."

It is the best car I've ever owned. I'm always learning something new about the STS. I don't know how they can make this car any better.  I advise everyone to take a test drive in the new STS, you'll fall in love with it."
cadillac,sts,2006,Brian, 10/21/2006,My Thoughts,4,"First two weeks with the STS have been great.  I have come from driving imports for many years and felt like I was taking a chance.  So far, only time will tell, I love the car.  Feature for feature and in the price dependent the luxury imports can't compare.  I have the V6 AWD and look forward to the winter snow.  This car is super quiet and so far rock solid.  It is almost freakish how many features that have been packed into the car and the first time that I have actually had to read an owners manual more than once to get a handle on all of the technology features and how to use everything."
cadillac,sts,2006,MATT B, 11/04/2006,STS is Dynamite!,5,"The standard personal choices via the touchscreen, and unbelievable ride and power of the 6-cylinder engine, have truly amazed me.   We are really, really happy with this car.  I am only 34 years old, and will buy over and over again, if Caddy stays on this course!"
cadillac,sts,2006,James B, 12/20/2006,2006 STS V6,4,"We love this car.  It has a smooth quiet ride, handles great, the Bose stereo is a must! The V6 has more than enough power.  "

I had low expectations concerning it's performance, but I am very impressed by how responsive and fun to drive this car is. I have put 2,500 miles on it so far and the car is defect free. The car is the same weight as my old STS but it feels much more light and nimble. Overall, I am delighted with it."
cadillac,sts,2006,Ron, 02/12/2007,Ron's Stealth Gray/Cashmere STS,4,"This is a good car with great incentives to buy or lease.  The ride is firm and quiet.  If you want the cushy ride of yesteryear move on.  It's quiet and feels good at highway speeds.  The V6 is quite impressive, smooth and fast off the line or for passing. It is quieter than the noisy Northstar V8. Its gas mileage is fair, but it's regular gas so deal with it! I have the cashmere interior with lighter wood trim and steering wheel...awesome look.  The electronics are a challenge, but good.  The voice recognition needs improvement.  I'm not disappointed at all."
cadillac,sts,2006,Queen, 04/23/2007,Imports Beware!,4,"Driving this car is like a dream. I never imagined owning a Cadillac and when I bought this one, I was actually looking at the Mercedes E350. After driving this car, you can't even compare them. The Cadillac won hands down. I recommend anyone looking in the luxury class to seriously think about taking a test drive in the STS before making a decision. It will change the way you think and look at American made cars. The manager at the dealer told me if I just drove the STS, I may never drive anything else. I think he may be right!"
cadillac,sts,2006,brian burka, 11/29/2005,Not Happy,2,"There are a few important things that I don't like about the 2006 STS.  The foot-well is so cramped that if you are like me, 6 feet tall, your right knee will rest against a very uncomfortable sharp hard-padded bolster.  The glove compartment is too small for such a large car...once the owner's manual is in, there is no room.  The trunk acess is poor.  The dash design is bland and could be much more luxurious.   "

Wheel bearings in both front and back 3. Park gear sensor in transmission replaced-computer does not recognize that car is in park. 4.  Im afraid #3 has caused a problem with the transmission as the car does not have any ""impulse"" power when put in drive. 5.  Overall very disappointing automobile so far.  I would definitely not recommend purchasing.  I certainly will not make this mistake again.  BMW and Lexus much better for the money.  I have owned both.  Tried to go with American car maker this time around.  Extremely disappointed.  Good Luck. "

Mine is the fully loaded v-8 awd model, with nav, headsup, and mag ride control. I have a 03 CTS and a 05 ESV and I would have to say I like this the best. Price is a little steep at $72,000 with all the options but it sure beats giving the Japanese more money! If you are worried about the gas, you can't afford the car! The v-8 is just as good on gas as the Cts with the 6cyl  "
cadillac,sts,2006,c77ward, 09/26/2008,Simply the Best,4,"Bought a Cadillac STS after trying all car makers, BMW, Mercedes, Acura and Went back home to the General. I am a car enthusiast and have owned over 20 cars in a 25 year time span. Cadillac has matched or beat the competition with the new sigma platform & V8 VVTI Northstar. For too many years, Auto magazines have prejudiced Car Buyers from buying American Luxury, I dare anyone serious about buying a top end luxury car with tons of bells and whistles and high end power to test drive this car. It can rival or beat any E or 5 series German Made Car with no match. 5.9 0-60 on my 2wd STS is comparable to the german made,and the Spec V is faster. The ride far surpasses anything they can muster."
cadillac,sts,2006,Jac122, 04/02/2006,Sorry... I lose!!!,2,"This is my second Caddy. I owned a 2003 Seville SLS, what a perfect car.  I looked forward to all the ""goodies"" in the 2006 model....WHAT A MISTAKE!  The car is so sluggish; it remains in 5th gear most of the time.  Press the accelerator and HOPE, then pray it responds usually won't.  Bluetooth has no teeth.  Frequently does not recognize phone, and does not work while driving. The voice recognition does not recognize ANYONE!   Its gas mileage is only about 15 mpg.  GM knows of the sluggishness and says ""its up to specs"" Your loss buddy.  Just give me my 2003 SLS and we'll call it even.  If you are considering a '06 STS V6 AWD, beware and test drive extensively first."
cadillac,sts,2006,bassplayer, 05/30/2006,The STS - Enjoy It For What It Is!,4,"I test drove several sport sedans and entry level luxury cars before purchasing this one.  The $5,000 dealer incentive had a lot to do with the purchase, I'll admit, but the car is tremendous, and a fine example of American car makers getting it right.  It blends performance with luxury, and offers more back seat room and trunk space than several comparable cars.  I agree with many reviewers that the glove box is poorly designed and offers no space.  However, the combination of power, AWD, luxury, braking, toys (XM, OnStar, Nav, etc.) were too good to pass up. This is a great looking car with a compliant ride with just enough road feel for me.  Bottom line, enjoy the car for what it is!            "

The only thing I have done is changed oil at 9400 miles and rotate the tires at the same time. I average 20 mpg , not bad could be better. The exterior design is beautiful, although standard wheels should be 18's. The interior is beautiful with exception of cheap hard plastics on the center stack. Seats are to firm. Overall I love the car, well that is until I saw the 08 CTS. I kind of feel like I am driving an old mans car next to the new CTS.  "

cadillac,sts,2006,Jeff lapsker, 06/24/2010,I love this car,4,"I drove Japanese cars my whole life. I am 52.  This 2006 STS V-8 was purchased with 28,000 miles in June of 2010.  Paid 21,000 and added a $3,000 bumper to bumper additional 50,000 mile warranty. This car is solid,  No outside noise heard.  Beautiful on the outside and inside. The most powerful engine I've ever had and it moves effortlessly.  The tach never has to go higher than 2200 rpm even at 80 mph.  There is a penalty for all this power.  I probably will spend $1500- 2000  more money in gas per year than my V-6 Maxima and avalon engines. I couldn't afford a new STS. So I got lucky getting an 06 with only 28,000 miles.  And it doesn't have a scratch.  Looks like new. Who uses the glove box"

The value and the fact that it is American made made my choice for me.  The American public in general does not care about driving road courses they care more about driving in traffic and are more used to American roads, not european hills and curves.  So who cares about most of the things car magazines care about. Unfortunately some people believe all they read and don't take the time to test drive the competition.  I believe if you blindfolded people they couldn't tell the difference between a Cadillac and a Lexus."

I am stunned by the improvement in high performance drivability, such as shifting on curves, and high speed maneuverability in traffic. The music system is superb, and satellite radio is a plus. I don't see why so many Americans buy a Lexus or BMW without putting this car to the test."
cadillac,sts,2006,Not A Fossil, 01/23/2006,Get the AWD,4,"The 2WD Cadillac STS has trouble going when the forecast even calls for snow. My 2% driveway grade is too much for it with just a dusting. That being said, the ride and quality is better than my previous Lexus. It's fun to drive. I had to replace the front control arm after 6,000 milies though.  This is a common problem with STS and CTS according to the service manager."
cadillac,sts,2006,Barbemm, 01/22/2006,Awesome Car,4,"Having had five previous Cadillac DeVilles, and one DTS, this STS all wheel drive is by far the most fun to drive. It handles and corners with unbelieveable control. I love driving this car. It is so quiet, I open the window to listen to hear if the engine is running. It is air tight, you don't hear a sound. The stereo is awesome. It still feels weird not using a key, but I am sure I will get used to it. The only three things I can compain about are the glove box is too small (I can't even fit the owners manual), the trunk space is not only limited but hard to get things in an out of, and the voice activation function is a joke.  It doesn't understand perfect English, I say ""windows down"" and it says, ""pardon, defrost on?"""

With 320 horses and great low-end torque its a rocket ship on wheels.  The all wheel drive ""rides on rails"" with the smoothest hard accelleration on the planet, and effortlessly climbs my steep driveway in the snow.  Great turning radius, big disc breaks stop smooth as silk, holds the sharpest of turns under power, and magnetic ride control gives sportscar feel, but smooths the road when needed.  And it makes your drive a dream with a cabin to die for, an astonishing sound system, bluetooth phone hookup, nav system and every gizmo you could possibly need.  Love this car!"
cadillac,sts,2006,Marvin Mays, 05/04/2006,No more Lexus for me...,4,I love my Cadillac STS. I was a Lexus man until I test drove a STS with the G package and the Northstar V-8. It's a whole lotta fun just to drive around the city. Driving on the open road will take your breath away.  It is nice to see an american car built this well 
cadillac,sts,2006,cinemel, 07/30/2005,The best so far,4,"This is my favorite STS so far. It's the third one I've owned. It handles responsively with a European tight suspension, not as mushy as the DeVille."
cadillac,sts,2006,GARRY, 07/31/2005,Cadillac STS,4,"After 3 Lexus models in a row, I decided on an STS.  It was the best auto choice I've made in years. Better dealership, better cost, and a far superior car.  Much more fun to drive and far superior in design of features."
cadillac,sts,2006,geoaquamariner, 08/09/2005,I Like My STS,4,"I have owned this vehicle for 2 months and lovin' it so far.  The only complaints I have is the glove box is too small, and the coin tray drawer is hard to access being right in front of the gear shift.  This car loves to run, and fast!  I am still learning all the details of the navigation system.  There is a lot it can do, but takes some practice and repetive use to get the handle on all its details.  This is a solid car that gives a great driving experience.  Cadillac got it right with this one. "
cadillac,sts,2006,Bstein, 08/09/2005,2006 Cadillac STS V8,4,"This car's Overall performance is good.  It is excellent on highway, it has very fast pickup.  Negatives- small glove compartment difficult access. Trunk space too small.  It can take only two sets of golf clubs. Positives- Its contempory styling and great handling."
cadillac,sts,2006,chink, 08/09/2005,America's Back! Wow what a Cadillac!,5,"Amazing! Truly amazing!  The line-up of the all new Cadillacs is outstanding, yet this one leads the pack.  The all new STS seriously will send its competitors racing back to the drawing board.  There are so many toys in this vehicle, you'll never get bored.  This puppy handles like a Corvette.  It's feline-like qualities shine in this model.  At 110 mph, this vehicle takes curves like a cat clawing gramma's furniture in fear for its life!  Exterior styling causes necks to snap as they attempt to determine what kind of vehicle your in.  Owning this vehicle is certain to subject neighbors to envy. Out of my way this is no longer Gramp's Cadillac! Finally a Caddy for us Gen Xers...not quite 30!"
cadillac,sts,2006,Dsc, 09/21/2005,I drove them all!,4,"I test drove the BMW 530, Mercedes-Benz E class, Lexus ES 330 and Audi A6. I had decided on the 5-Series but drove the Cadillac STS at the last minute and LOVED IT! It is a great car, feels sporty, but is large enough to comfortably accomodate rear passengers. It has so many bells and whistles I haven't had time to figure them all out yet. Incredible car!"
cadillac,sts,2006,Bob, 10/18/2005,Bob's review,5,"The design and quality of the 2006 Cadillac STS are outstanding.  The reason I like the design, the car is distinctive and does not look like every other car on the road. "
cadillac,sts,2006,Peter Heimann, 10/18/2005,2006 Cadillac STS,5,This is by far the best built vehicle I have ever purchased.  With this vehicle General Motors has done an oustanding job of competing with European and Japanese products.
cadillac,sts,2006,chris, 11/09/2005,Cadillac STS,5,My 2006 Cadillac STS V8 is an excellent and fun car to drive.  The electronics are the easiest to use of the premier luxury sedans I have been in and it handles beautifully.  I really wanted a fun and reliable car and this car has more than delivered!
cadillac,sts,2006,tom fuller, 11/12/2005,"Fun, but not up to the Quality of Lexus",3,"My wife and I each have a 2006 Cadillac STS V6 because I feel strongly that I prefer to buy an American car.  Unfortunately, my car has been into the shop four times to have trim pieces put back on, and there is a distracting amount of wind noise which cannot be resolved and apparently is just the way the car is.  My wife's previous car, a Lexus, was whisper quiet, so we're not used to this.  If GM wants owners of BMW and Lexus to go to Cadillac, they will have to do some major work on the entire way they build cars and treat their customers.  I also own a BMW Z4, and having had this plus the Lexus, going down to a Cadillac has been a shock.  So I'm not saying I won't get another one, but the jury's still out."
cadillac,sts,2006,JoeonLI, 11/13/2005,V6 STS Review,5,"This is my first Cadillac. I've owned several GM cars, and this one is the best. I leased it, and would get another one without hesitation. The tranny is so seamless, it's hard to notice it shift while cranking out music over the 15 speaker system. Cadillac hit a home run here."
cadillac,sts,2006,andy, 01/29/2006,Cadillac Sport Sedan,5,"I believe that the STS is a great value. The only option I got was the AWD, since before purchased I heard from many people ""Cadillacs are bad in the snow"". With OnStar, 6 airbags, traction control, a Lojack style tracking disabling device, I feel safe taking it on the road. I like this car a lot. It is not too big, and it has the big car feels"
cadillac,sts,2006,Jay Holloway, 02/19/2006,First Cadillac Ever,3,"I bought my Cadillac STS V6 around Christmas time, trading in a Mercedes-Bena.  Previously, I have had two Lexus GS 300s. The STS is very quiet and comfy.  The DVD audio is SLOW to respond to orders though and the voice recognition does not work. Its Bluetooth is reliable. The navigation system is fine, but won't let you use it while driving even if your passenger is trying to use it.  Bluetooth functionality is limited while driving as well.  The backseat is tight for leg room. OnStar costs a fortune. The trunk is smaller than expected.  Having said this, my ownership experience has been excellent despite the flaws.  The stereo using DVD audio discs has OUTSTANDING sound quality and will make you really want it.  The video image and functionalty of the navigation screen is large but average resolution. The interior ambience with DVD audio is great."
cadillac,sts,2006,sanjeevp, 03/17/2006,AWD Alternative to Lexus 430/460,3,"One of the best vehicles to come out of Detroit. Nice balance between the performance and handling of BMW & Mercedes; and comfort of Lexus 430. Performance, handling and ride are excellent; user interface and voice recognition are poorly executed; reliability for 1st year is good according to CR. Good (and less expensive) AWD alternative to Lexus 430/460 in Northern snow areas; in my opinion superior to BMW and Mercedes. But you can still get better value for money with the Infiniti M45."
cadillac,sts,2006,Skyking, 04/04/2006,"Power, Luxury, Price Equals Value",5,"After looking at V8 models of comparable cars from Inifinti, Lexus, and Mercedes I discovered the answer was built in America,  In style, performance, technology, comfort, convience, and luxury the the Cadillac STS added up to value.  The convenience of making a call and having the car picked up for service with a loaner STS dropped off cannot be beat.  It is everything I was looking for in a car for less money than the competitors.  When more costs less I consider that the mark of VALUE.  "
cadillac,sts,2006,DMakoff, 05/16/2006,Cadillac V8 STS,4,"This is the best car I have leased.  I find its ride to be more fun than the top tier German cars I have had and it has a better sound system.  It is priced right, at considerable savings over the competition.  GM got it right with this car."
cadillac,sts,2006,ed, 05/17/2006,STS Cadillac,5,"This is the finest Cadillac that I have driven to date (I have had nine previously).  The handling is suberb and rivals that of a BMW (I have driven the 5- and 7-Series).  The pickup is better than I espected from a V6 (less than 7 seconds).  The interior is more than adequate for me (6'2"").  This car has all the amenities that you would want and most are standard. I have white diamond paint which cost $995 retail which is a bit much, but it is a beautiful color.  The car is very tight and there very little road noise that enters the cabin. While the STS isn't for everyone it is for the discerning driver. Hats off to GM because I think they finally got it right."
cadillac,sts,2006,Gene, 09/17/2006,STS,4,"This is a very nice car that is fun to drive.  I love the keyless entry and navigation system. Thanks GM, Cadillac is BACK."
cadillac,sts,2006,GRSMITH, 10/07/2006,Definitly Top Five,5,The Cadillac STS is possibly one of the top five sport sedans competing in this market.  Its handling is superb and its ride comfort is first rate. I've had many compliments on its styling. Cadillac has built a winner. 
cadillac,sts,2006,Richard, 01/04/2007,Cadillac is Back,4,"After two decades of owning Mercedes, BMW, and Infiniti, I decided to test the Cadillac STS. I selected the STS over the Mercedes E350 and Infiniti M35.  Its ride is firm but smooth.  The electronic features are fantastic.  Remote start with heated seats and steering wheel make cold mornings easier.  The 15 speaker Bose stereo with XM radio is FANTASTIC. I get about 20 MPG on my commute and on a recent road trip I averaged 23 MPG at 80 MPH."
cadillac,sts,2006,JT, 04/29/2007,STS Purchase,4,"I traded in my CTS from an 2006 STS last year and have been very pleased with the purchase to date. I've had no issues with this vehicle. It has been extremely reliable. I compared with a BMW 5-series before purchasing my STS, and in my opinion the Cadillac offers much more value for the money. The touchscreen interface is very intuitive and easy to use, and in my opinion far superior to the German systems.  "
cadillac,sts,2006,roger, 04/25/2007,The Cadillac,3,Dealership did not know about the slap stick shifter. I worked in Chicago  for 4 months commuting and the car got great mileage. I live 90 miles from Chicago. The mileage in the city was terrible. I was getting 14.0 to 15.3! I thought I was getting a wood grain steering wheel. I guess it was not in the 1sb package. V6 never again. The transmission stays in the current gear when you stomp the gas. GM blew that. Turning radius is not tight enough. That button you hold for 7 second is OK but the transmisson is better when you don't use the computers.  
cadillac,sts,2006,Mark Anthony, 07/27/2007,Cadillac Man!,5,"This is my 5th new Cadillac and so far the best.  People are in awe when I tell them the features. Windows down by voice,   push button start, keyless access, just walk up to the car and the car door opens automatically.  15 speaker Bose stereo and navigation screen, it even plays DVD's and MP3's!  The automatic transmission shifts without the clutch. I just love this car. I clean it everyday!"
cadillac,sts,2006,sts, 05/10/2008,not for winter driving,3,Lousy car in winter. Car should not be sold without four wheel drive in this area.  GM messed up on this. Also  my 8 cylinder  Cadillac got better mileage than the 6.

cadillac,sts,2006,treybehindthewheel, 01/27/2019,Great ride and handling in a solid car!,5,"I did my research before buying a used luxury vehicle. I have bought American brand cars most of my life, so I really wanted an American brand. I was expecting to see Lexus, Volvo, Audi, Mercedes, Infiniti and Acura when the 2006 STS appeared on my screen! I have had eight previous Cadillac's, but never an STS. I looked and looked for one in my area and finally had my new Caddy pop up. Drove three hours for a test drive, but it was worth every dime. My ""new"" 2006 STS has not disappointed in any respect except the trunk entry space is a bit cramped for large items. Beware large suitcases or coolers! Also, the GPS is antiquated and difficult to operate. Outside of that. Wow! How can this car be 14 years old? So many creature comforts that work flawlessly, including ventilated front seats!!! This is my ninth Cadillac, and I have been very surprised with the ride and drive on this '06.  Engine is a 3.8 V6 and surprisingly powerful coupled with the five speed shiftable automatic. When I placed everything the Cadillac STS had going for it against everything other luxury sedans in the same price range and then took the negatives into consideration - the STS was the clear winner. This is my 37th vehicle and ninth Caddy. It’s a year down the road and no regrets.
"
cadillac,sts,2006,Dennis Glodoski, 10/04/2020,Awesome Cadillac STS,4,"If you can get by the cheap GM plastic and fake wood trim by the radio and HVAC this Cadillac is definitely an amazing machine very underrated for sure if you get the 1SG package then you won’t be disappointed it lives up to the Cadillac standard of performance and luxury, I’m very happy with my 1SG STS AWD very reliable sedan (like any vehicle if you take care of it good) just keep up with your oil changes and your cam phasers won’t fail like any VVT system oil maintenance is important! Very complex technology indeed, honestly if your mechanically inclined this car will last as long as a Lexus! Only thing I had to replace was the oil pressure switch and maf sensor other then that just the common wear items such as brakes and tires, weak points are the differential bushings and cheap GM electronics, besides that this car is seriously a bench mark for today’s current Cadillac line ups, it’s got a German tuned sigma platform chassis good suspension set up and brakes. Definitely an ATS and XTS challenger, if you can find one with the LH2 Northstar engine try it you won’t be disappointed! Honestly GM’s finest Cadillac built. 
"
cadillac,sts,2006,KIETSA, 11/02/2020,NICE RIDE,5,"I bought this 2006 STS nine years ago.  It's my sixth.  Great car, except for the past three years, it's had an 'extended crank' problem that the local dealer couldn't figure out.  Finally, my brother's mechanic told me it's a check valve in the fuel pump.  It's a $1,600 job, which is almost the value of the car.  It usually takes two attempts to start the car; sometimes three.  I contacted Cadillac and I'm sure you know what I got:  0!  I'm looking for an XT5 at the moment.
"
cadillac,sts,2007,MR T, 11/19/2006,Tough to Beat,4,"I just leased a 2007 Cadillac STS V6 all wheel drive. This car is a blend of performance, luxury, and technology. With the V6 you have enough power and all wheel drive should give me great control in the winter. This is not your Father's Cadilliac. It has a smooth ride with enough power to keep your attention. The interior is luxurious. I chose this car over the BMW 5 series, E350 Benz, Lexus GS, and Infiniti M45. I chose the STS because its luxury, performance, and lease incentives. The sticker was $52,000 and I leased it for $612 a month with nothing down. This car competes with the others in its class too. When I look at the US cars most of them are not worthy to compete in this class. The STS is. This is the new Caddy!"
cadillac,sts,2007,Jeremy Trynor, 10/13/2006,STS much better than 2006 S Class Benz,5,"This car is 30 grand cheaper than Mercedes and absolutely runs better.  You don't have a service engine light come on everyday like the German vehicles.  The 6 cylinder is nailing 19.7 mpg combined hard driving, and is extremely quick off the line and very quiet.  We truly cannot believe how much we enjoy this car.  Seats, performance, Bose Audio and Wood grain are above expectations."
cadillac,sts,2007,moneyfornothing, 10/24/2006,My Daily Driver of Choice,4,"I've owned an Audi, a BMW, and a Lexus. None of those satisfy me like the STS Northstar. It has lots of power, the best handling sedan I've driven, PERFECT Audio by Bose, great engine tone, and luxurious appointments. I drive nearly 80 miles every day so comfort and fun are important to me. None of my previous luxury cars have held up well. My Corvette is still my weekend car though. I am thrilled with this car, but when the time comes, I'd love to get an XLR-V (yeah, I just need to save for 2 years :-D). I suggest you stop looking after Cadillac. No BMW, Audi, or Lexus will compare, and I have experience with them all."
cadillac,sts,2007,Will, 03/09/2017,Great car! A Real Cadillac that beats BMW!,5,"I have owned this car for 3 years and has been great owning this car. I owned a 2002 Eldorado and this car is vastly improved over the Eldorado. The engine is strong to redline. The transmission is silky smooth and when drive fast shifts smooth and fast with no lag in downshifting. Passing on the highway is effortless and is strong in any situation. The suspension is smooth in touring mode and nice and firm in sport mode but not harsh. Extremely comfortable, any person can find a nice position to drive comfortably. It's luxury, performance and value all in one car. All I have needed to do is replace the rear shocks outside regular maintenance. Not a bad deal. All the electronics and power options work fine after 10 years. All the interior and exterior has held up wonderfully. No rattles, squeaks or noises. Extremely happy with the STS V8 AWD. I recommend to stay away from the v6 and go with either V8 STS. Truly a driver's car that you can put the family in without giving up anything. When you're alone you can drive it like a Corvette and when your with the family you can drive it like a Cadillac with all it comes with, comfort, great ride, and quality with all the luxury you could want. BMWs, Lexus and Mercedes of this age are nowhere near holding up like the Cadillac. Especially in the price to fix all the problems those cars have when they get to this age. Don't forget the price to fix them neither! Cadillac prices for parts are much cheaper to replace than all those cars. I drove a S class Mercedes that was two years newer than my car and it felt like it was going to fall apart, total junk! My Cadillac drives like a two year old car, not a ten year old car. American cars get a bad rap. I'll take a Cadillac over all those cars I mentioned any day. Maybe I got lucky and found a good one, but I don't think so. I think it is a well built and engineered car.

cadillac,sts,2007,Rodney Knight, 09/01/2006,One of the Best,4,The 2007 Cadillac STS is a wonderful car.  I see lots of reviews.  Until retirement I was a damage appraiser.  I know what's underneath and this car is just head and shoulders above the imports. 
cadillac,sts,2007,Palak, 10/04/2016,Great car,5,"My 2007 STS Platinum edition was recently totaled in an accident.  It was a great car.  I had over 118,000 miles on it and I drive a great deal for work.  The only problems I had with it were related to running over some free debris, so I can't blame the car for that.  I truly loved this car and will miss it.  I can't find one for sale anywhere in the same trim or color.  The only fault in this car is I wish it came with a rear view camera for backing up.
"
cadillac,sts,2007,cadfanatic, 09/03/2010,Well Made Car,4,"This car is a dream.  It performs well and looks great.  I have had no problems with it.  Unless you get a 535i or higher, they do not compare.  BMW's are mechanical pieces of junk.  You best not keep one after the warranty runs out. This caddy is super, handles extremely well.  I also own a 2001 STS.  It has 180,000 miles on it, still runs like new.  To all the haters, you can put a dead key fob in the center console pocket and the car will work fine.  Read the manual.  If you want cavernous rear seat room, get the DTS."
cadillac,sts,2007,Brandon Young, 01/10/2007,"Northstar Gas Mileage on ""6"" is Good",5,"The STS has won us over.  For the price, looks, convenience, build quality, gas mileage, we are extremely pleased with this machine."
cadillac,sts,2007,sluggomagoo, 12/21/2016,After 8 years no regrests,5,"I'll be the first to admit that I don't use it often.  It's a weekend warrior and in some cases due to the summer tires when it snows I don't drive it. I picked it up used with 7k on it in 2008. 8 years later I got slightly over 60k. Besides oil changes, breaks and tires, I've had to replace the battery due to age. I did have a pot hole issue which bent a rim and a lower control arm, I had both left and right arms replaced.  The glove box latch broke because it's cheap. I'm real careful with it now. There's nothing high tech about it. I guess it could use a USB and a WIFI but, It's a car not a internet router. It does have GPS and remote garage opener. The stock sound system is excellent. I'm hoping to get 10 more years out of it if I live that long. I didn't like the GM dealer support where I live. They can't fix anything right. Can't even air up ties correctly.
"
cadillac,sts,2007,Sammy Sam, 09/16/2015,Not so Good,1,"This is my second Caddy. I thought I'd get a four door car because my family grew. Well this car I got from the dealer was a eye catcher and test drove it fine. After a couple weeks, I started to have some issues, the dealer couldn't figure it out and the warranty on the car wouldn't kick in since they can't nail what the problem was. Basically the noise sounded like a belt going bad, they changed everything imaginable and still the issue was there. Brakes are horrible, and electronic pieces go to quickly such as the steering wheel controls for the radio. Additionally, to replace your headlights you have to remove the entire bumper off to do so, dealer asks 350.00 in labor only, which is a rip off, although I do it myself, I have to take the day out on a weekend to do it which then the rest of the weekend is gone. My opinion is that they need to make a car that is consumer friendly for repairs such as maintenance for lighting etc. and then the dealers need to know how to fix these issues. So far this is my last Caddy and wouldn't buy another.. Going back to BMW. Way better car.

cadillac,sts,2007,Former Caddy Owner, 05/22/2009,My Last Cadillac,4,"This is my 3rd or 4th Cadillac (lost count) but it is surely my last one.  This little STS has had one annoying problem after another...and NO MILES ON IT!!!  This evening it has shut down completely and doesn't recognize fobs, won't open the trunk or move out of PARK.  Road Side Assistance sent a tow truck out to carry the car back to the dealer, but, the tow driver couldn't budge the car out of PARK.  Thankfully, we are home and have a second vehicle (Toyota) so we aren't stranded.  Now, if this was happening at a mall or anywhere on the road, this incident would be more than infuriating.  I would not advise anyone to buy a Cadillac."
cadillac,sts,2007,Statesman, 05/03/2009,A Sporty Luxoboat,4,"I inherited my like new '07 STS this year and it is a pleasure to drive.  There are only a few squawks: programming without the nav screen is complex and the drivers seat appears loose (there's a TSB that addresses it) and nitrogen-filled tires are a bit overboard.  Aside from those minor criticisms, the car is an excellent performing car.  It's rakish looks are complemented by its terrific handling."
cadillac,sts,2007,Cadi07AWDV8, 08/17/2010,Very happy!,4,"I love the V8 AWD, the few thousand is worth it for the AWD option if you are in snow states. Also the magnetic ride control with the available option of riding with performance or touring is great. I love the navigation, once you get it down. it is quite user friendly. Definitely luxurious with the diamond white pearl and the cashmere interior and light brown wood grain! Great sound with the Bose speakers also! HID lights and LED tail-lights. This car is perfect!"
cadillac,sts,2007,locdoc, 07/26/2008,Stay away,3,"I leased this car, and within the first year, the car was in the shop for over 30 days!  It was first a recall, then rattles in the trunk that took three tries to fix, then a blown speaker, then Homelink failures.  Unbelievable!  I was never offered anything for my troubles by the dealer or GM.  Bottom line, I traded for a 2008 335i BMW sedan and could not be happier.  BMW offers so much more for the money.  Imagine that, a BMW more affordable and a better value than a Cadillac!!  The original list on the Caddy was $65,000, and it wholesaled after I traded it in for $25000, and only after 13 months!!  "
cadillac,sts,2007,caddy owner, 01/07/2010,not so good,3,"I have enjoyed leasing this caddy. I was so happy the day I picked up. Over the past 3 years the car has had some problem. There was about 4 recalls. I wore a hole through the driver side carpet. The outside chrome has come off. Gas tank lid spring broke. Knobs on the dash have worn off. I only avg 14 mpg. A bit under powered. Trunk and back seat way too small. The rims bust up very easy. Had to replace 2 of them in the past 2 years. The plus is the car looks great and does have a smooth ride. After driving the car for 3 years I would never buy one. Its just not a well made car for a stick price of $54,000."
cadillac,sts,2007,Lomcc, 05/24/2008,Lots of small problems!,3,"I leased this car almost a year ago because I could get a great lease deal and liked the styling.  The engine and transmission are the best features on this car.  It rides extremely well and has lots of power! The problem is in the details.  The Bluetooth is a joke. Our BMW works light years better.  The navigation system interface was poorly designed.  It is confusing much harder to use than any other I have tried. There has already been one recall, plus a loose metal piece that had to replaced in the trunk, plus a non- working Homelink garage opener, plus lack of good steering wheel controls.  For the same price, you could get a BMW that is MUCH better!"
cadillac,sts,2007,mlpjlk, 07/11/2008,Great Looking car with Feature Issues,4,"Like most people on this forum are stating, this car looks great, rides great, preforms great, stops great, etc... Mechanically, this car looks and performs head and shoulders above its competition.  Where the STS falls short of everyone else is in the creature comforts that make a luxury car a luxury car.  GM went cheap and misses the mark on these items.  Bluetooth only certified to work on phones older then 2007.  May work with newer ones, but they are not 100% Bluetooth compliant.  See Suggested improvements below for more."

I received an abundance of rebates and leased this car for 36 months with only paying taxes for 420.00/month.  GM sent me a 2000.00 off certificate as well.  The car handles smoothly, I can feel the road.  The V6 is plenty powerful and I didn't lease based on the $46,000 MSRP.  The car is tight, beautifully equipped and rides like a dream.  I have OnStar, my own voice activated phone etc.  If GM could get people to drive this car they would buy it.  Kudos to General Motors for getting their act together."

cadillac,sts,2007,Tony, 01/02/2008,"Not worth $54,0000",4,"I have now driven this car for a sold year. The car looks great and handles well. There are some problems that you should not have with this price range. I have noises in the power stearing. The gas cover is cheap and is just spring loaded. I get less than 14.5 miles a gallon in the city. I do like the style and handleing. There is somthing about a caddy that has a dual exhaust that is streamlined. All n All this is not a $54,000 car. This is more like a $40,000 car. If you were to compare this to the Lexus or Benz in the same price range you might sway away from the Caddy but the Caddy have much better lease deals. I was able to lease this luxury car for nothing down and $599 a month!"
cadillac,sts,2007,brian, 07/10/2007,Car is great,4,"Car is an automotive winner. She blows the doors off the Mercedes Benz E class, the Infinity M35, or the 535 series BMW. in both performance and and good looks. Full featured for far less. "
cadillac,sts,2007,Bill, 01/02/2008,Pleasantly Surprised !,4,"After some very expensive minor repairs and service to our Mercedes E320, My wife and I started researching alternatives. We have owned mostly German and Honda cars for many years. (Except for my jewel- like '94 Vett).  She thought the CTS was too ""edgy"" but was totally taken by the STS.  I was a little skeptical until we took it for a test drive.  It was really impressive and comfortable.  The first 1000 mile trip yielded 25 mpg on regular gas. Some of the controls are a little unfriendly but well worth the time to master.  Last night I started the STS from inside a restaurant which turned on the heater & seat heaters during a snowstorm.  The warrenty and OnStar are great. "
cadillac,sts,2007,browser, 01/11/2008,"Finally, Believer in American",4,"I picked up my 2007 STS with 5K miles about 3 weeks ago. After owning a Lexus, Infiniti, Mercedes and BMW, I think the STS presented the most value for the car. This was my first American car in over 20 years. What an improvement in design and quality!!  I love the technolgy and comfort. Finally nice job"
cadillac,sts,2007,DawnHouse, 02/15/2008,First Luxury car!,4,"I have only had my STS for less than a month, but so far I fall in love all over again every day! I have had an H- 2 for two years, which I thought was luxurious until this Cadillac! This car is easilly the favorite of anything I have or ever will have. The ride is incredibly smooth, like butter, I can't imagine how the V-8 STS could accelerate much faster than my V-6 because it is FAST, and the overall handling is to die for. The XM radio and the OnStar are things I don't need but use often. I think the pearl white (White Diamond) paint was the final selling point for me, as it is stunning. I bought my '07 brand new in '08, saved quite a bit doing it this way & would definately reccomend!"
cadillac,sts,2007,JWD, 02/23/2008,2007 STS 4,4,Had this STS for a month now and have to say it an awesome car. Living in the north the AWD has shown that it can handle the winters here. This car handles great and is very quiet and comfortable to drive. Seems to be built solid and the V6 has enough power to keep you intrested and still provides an average of 18 mpg. The 5.1 Bose stereo is the best I have ever heard in a car.
cadillac,sts,2007,Sylvia, 01/04/2007,My STS rocks!,4,"I've enjoyed owning my Cadillac STS - I can sum up my experience like this: reliable, luxury, solid, head-turning, quiet, smooth, f-a-s-t!, beautiful, graceful, turns on a dime, great stability and best of all, my 6'6"" husband fits comfortably...."
cadillac,sts,2007,tj65, 09/07/2007,"2nd STS for me, and I love my '07!!",5,"This is my 2nd STS. I expected a lot of my new '07 STS and have been very pleased so far! Cars I considered before buying my STS - all very nice but either too small or offered less value: 1. Acura TL and RL 2. Lexus GS and IS 3. Infinity M35 4. Subaru Tribeca 5. Audi A6 6. Mercedes E Class 7. BMW 5 Series 8. Volvo S70  The '07 STS handles like a sports car with luxury feel; exacly what I was looking for! It's quick for a V6 - I test drove the V6 and V8, and there was not a huge difference to justify the incremental cost.  I looked at a bunch of cars, and the STS, in my opinion, gave me by far the best bang for the buck (see favorite features below)  Very pleased so far!"
cadillac,sts,2007,John, 10/18/2007,Magnificent Automobile,4,"My search for a leftover 2007 STS V8 took some effort but it was definitely worth it.  I prefer the 2007 grill to the more enhanced 2008 version - clearly a matter of taste. Previous car was a 2000 E320. I would say that the STS is in another league in terms of overall refinement.  The interior is absolutely beautiful - particularly in Cashmire. I have not taken the time to figure out the navigation system but all other controls are user friendly.  The quality of materials is on par or superior to the Mercedes.  Aside from a Corvette, this is the best American car on the road today! "
cadillac,sts,2008,KRSTS, 06/20/2010,I fall in love everyday,5,"I have owned this STS for 27 months and I love it more everyday.
It was a GM owned CPO with only 8200 miles.
This is my third Cadillac.
My others were all V8s and I do not miss the V8 at all.
The V6DI is great engine, not only for the power but the fuel mileage.
The car is very comfortable on long trips and handles like a dream.
There were a few minor issues early that were promptly fixed by the dealer. Now I only take it in for an annual oil change and inspection. Best car I have ever owned in my 67 years."
cadillac,sts,2008,jeff sunshine, 11/10/2008,Solid player,4,"I purchased mine at the end of August when there were only V6 AWD models. I traded my V8 STS and thought I would be taking a step down. With V6 DI engine, I really do not miss the V8. So far this car is solid in all respects; handles well,comfortable, reliable, good mileage and is fast enough. In my opinion, this car favorably competes with BMW, MB and the other usual suspects but after you negotiate your final price, there really is no comparison becuse you pay a lot less. The status of a label is unimportant to me (although a Caddy still has some clout left) and as car enthusiast, I look to the raw driving experience. STS is right there and if the V8 G8 had AWD, I would be driving that."
cadillac,sts,2008,LarryG, 01/16/2009,Lemonade,4,"Leased my 2008 STS in late December, 2007. Failed camshaft sensor, failed right side cam at 13,000 miles, deffective FOB's, 5-burned out lights, deffective driver's seat lumbar system. Dealer is great but car spends too much time in service bay.  Will not lease or buy another GM product. Totaly fed up."
cadillac,sts,2008,Cosmo, 08/11/2007,08 STS is hot,4,"302-horsepower engine with direct injection V6. A bolder look on the outside and inside will attract younger buyers. I am 41.  I wanted a 4 wheel drive car that can accommodate 3 car seats in the back. I looked at the BMW 535xi, Lexus GS350 AWD Infiniti M35 (currently drive Infiniti M45) at Audi A6. For the money the 2008 I stress the 2008 STS was the best value. The increased performance and the side air extractors,  incorporated into the front fenders of STS. New chrome-plated door handles and lower rocker moldings are added for more presence and refinement. "
cadillac,sts,2008,powerline87, 08/05/2012,My first Cadillac,4,"This is my first Cadillac and my first car that was over $1000.

Value: I got my car 3-4 years old, because the price drops by $20-25k by then.

Performance: 302hp 3.6L DI V6.
52/48 weight dist. AWD. Dual-Wishbone front suspension - It handles better than most smaller cars I've driven, and even handles about as well as the CTS, despite being bigger and more comfortable.

Comfort:
I have driven a Lincoln MKZ, a Cadillac CTS and SRX, and a Lexus ES 350, and the STS is the most comfortable out of all of them.
It is roomier and its seats just feel more comfortable.

Summary: A used 2008-2011 Cadillac STS has a better balance between luxury and performance than any other car in my price range."
cadillac,sts,2008,Will, 10/19/2017,Stay Away From The Northstar V8,3,"I have owned 2 Cadillac STS's thus far. The First was a 2005 with the V8 and the one I have now is a 2008. They are great cars for the thought but stay away from the V8 North star engines by all means. At around 87, 000 and up the V8 North star starts going to the ground with problems. The found out problem with this engine is the design for the cylinder head mounting studs start to loosen due to corrosion and the material or metal used for the Head studs that clamp them down. This leads to head gasket failure and even engine damage. You can get the head gaskets fixed but the problem will come back after 30,000 miles or so, ultimately leaving you with a reoccurring and expensive problem. You can re-drill new studs in the engine and the problem still will come back. Its a nice luxury / performance car overall but I recommend buying the V6 with the 306hp. Oh and on my 2005 car the transmission started to give up on me. I think the 5 speed can barely handle the V8 power, the 07 and up have 6 speeds that are more adequate.

The lows had no THUMP the Mids were Watery and the highs were muted. Apparently There are five different listener settings: Centerpoint, Driver, Talk, Normal and Rear. Centerpoint is the setting to use. The other four settings make the system sound awful at high volumes. Centerpoint wakes up the entire system and is easily comparable to the Boston Acoustic sytem I just came out of from my SRT8 Charger. "
cadillac,sts,2008,GM Never Again, 08/04/2008,Stick with a luxury import,3,"The car is fun to drive and is great when its not in the repair shop. I have had my STS in service 2 times in the last three months (BRAND NEW) for different problems. GM and Cadillac treat you like you bought a Chevy.You pay a high end price and get low end service. To sum it up, they suck and I will never buy a GM product again. High end imports are more reliable and give much better customer service."
cadillac,sts,2008,Neville, 03/13/2016,Try a Mercedes before buying this.,1,"This is the worst car I have ever bought. I only have 56k miles on it, and have had many electrical issues, some of which have made the car unusable. The dealer service is expensive and incompetent. The car itself, when it works, is pleasant enough, but is totally unreliable. No wonder GM went broke making rubbish like this.
Update: my local independent mechanic has repaired most of the electrical issues, and apart from minor issues which appear and then apparently fix themselves, the car is now relatively reliable.
Update: I have now owned this miserable car for nearly 4 years. My opinion is unchanged. Never another Cadillac!

cadillac,sts,2008,Samlh, 06/22/2008,Driving the 2008 STS,4,"I bought the V8 style, because adaptive speed control was not available on the V6.  I traded in my 2005 STS, and got a great deal on the purchase.  To this point, I am very pleased with the car, although gas mileage has not been good.  Hopefully, it will get batter as I put more miles on the car.  Although my 2008 is still very new,I believe it is a big improvement over the 2005.  The car looks and rides better.  I believe I made a good decision in purchasing  the 2008 STS."

I have owned many Lincolns, several Mercedes, a terrific Jag and some unmentionables over my almost 40 years of ""business"" driving. This car has great styling, exceptional sound system and many, many options.  It is very responsive, quite and comfortable to drive.  I drove all the ""others"" before I chose the caddy and price was not a concern.  I'm glad to be driving an American sport sedan.  It looks good and drive great.  Time will tell but so far it's a winner."
cadillac,sts,2008,David Lovitt, 04/19/2008,STS not so good,3,Car has been into shop twice with less than 400 miles on the odometer.  Today it completely died after refusing to shift into any gear higher than second. Problems with stability control and antilock brake system at 200 miles. Also has some paint flaws that need to be addressed. I'm sorry I tried so hard to buy this vehicle.
cadillac,sts,2008,Eric, 07/30/2008,From 2 BMW to Cadillac...,4,"After 2 BMW,I just bought my first caddy at 36 yrs old.I was just tired seeing BMW,G35,NEW C-class even the new CTS every corner. So I found a great STS. It's very comfy very luxurious and the space inside. The nav with the 15 speakers from Bose? Oh la la. Its the best oem sound system I've ever heard, by the way I am a musician. Of course the mileage is so so I bought the v8. Funny that the hid light are not std for that car.  Overall its a good value when reduce cause I wouldn't buy at full retail. I love everything about the car but its not BMW handling and driving experience. When you think about it who care were not formula 1 driver, right? Cadillac: the ultimate luxury experience? I guess"
cadillac,sts,2008,Tony, 07/20/2008,The best value for your money!,4,I had S-class Mercedes and BMW 7 several times before. I changed my S500 and I'm glad I did. Those fancy Germans are just not worth the money when it comes to compare.
cadillac,sts,2008,Herb, 12/06/2008,Bad Paint,4,"Love it, except the paint. The car is black, and I had it waxed immediately, by a professional. The first time I cleaned it myself, I discovered many pock marks on the hood and rear deck. They are in the paint, and wax does not remove them. I am taking it into the dealer to check. The paint is defective, and I hope someone will back it up."
cadillac,sts,2008,Larry G, 02/20/2008,Fantastic Car,4,"I had driven a Volvo S-60 with AWD and wanted a bigger AWD car. Looked at BMW, Audi, Lexsus and settled on the STS with the new direct injected V-6. Great power, great tranny. Car has every bell and whistle. Love the remote start, heated-cooled seats and the heated steering wheel. Car is good looking outside and very attractive inside. Great highway cruiser but also very agile and responsive in city driving. In snow or rain the AWD is superb!"
cadillac,sts,2008,John Lerner, 08/18/2007,2008 STS 6 cylinder is a dream!,5,"2008 STS  Just delivered and drove from East Hampton Long Island to Myrtle Beach South Carolina.  Wife and kids love the ride on this car, more than our former BMW 5 series.  MPG combined on the car's computer stunned us with 21.6 combined, and 27 mpg all day long on the highway, running 87 octane!"
cadillac,sts,2008,Hugh, 11/13/2007,The Right Decission,4,"Have only owned the Caddy for a couple of weeks, and I am very impressed. I looked at evrything from BMW's, Acrua's other Cadillac's, and even the new Buick Enclave.  I live in snow country of upper Michigan, and the STS afforded me the opportunity to own a classy, Luxury car with AWD. Gas mileage is great compared to owning an SUV upper here. And the in-line V6 has all the get up an go that I would need. At first the Navigation system appears to offer it self to one with a degree in computers, but a little hands on time is all thats needed.  Cost more than the CTS, but you get more and it is defintely a better auto for the extra money!"
cadillac,sts,2008,Charlie Higgins, 05/26/2008,Best luxury sports sedan,5,"Since January my wife and I have driven this vehicle daily.  At 250 miles we took off to Florida from Ohio and averaged 24 mpg at 68 mph.  Many times I took it above 75.  The six speed transmission feels almost continuously variable.  We purchased the navigation option along with the luxury interior package and AWD.  I agree 18"" wheels would have been nice but the HD brakes are not compatible with this larger wheel.  The car performance is smooth and controllable compared to the BMW 535 and the Mercedes E Series. We  test drove the CTS and agree with other reviewer that there is no comparison . Quality is unassailable and with 5500 miles ytd we would purchase all over again.  "
cadillac,sts,2008,Matt, 03/09/2010,"1st Cadillac, Great Car",4,"This was my 1st Cadillac. I purchased it new in Dec 09.  It was on the dealer lot of 1.5 years and I got a great deal.  After reading all of the reviews, was worried about build quality and reliability.  I have been very happily surprised.  Ride quaility is #1, handling and V8 performance are great.  I am in my mid 40's and looked at Lexus, Infiniti, MB.  The caddy, for the price, exceeded those other car makers.  My younger friends have all been impressed with this car and are looking a Cadillac instead of a BMW or lexus.  I hope that GM will continue to improve the model.  At this writing, I don't think I will purchase anything but a Cadillac again.  I have been very satisfied."
cadillac,sts,2008,TexasPhotographer, 10/03/2007,My First Cadillac,4,"I like this car. However, the manual reads like it was written in a language other than English.  Instead of providing information, the manual refers you to two other pages to get the information.  The navigation system is nice, but difficult to learn and again the manual is little to no help.  The seats are comfortable and I like the sporty ride.  The glove compartment is way too small.  I do not like the fact that when opening the trunk, it does not open fully.  As a photographer I have arms full of equipment.  I would have liked the trunk to open so I could put the equipment in the trunk instead of on the ground so I can manually open the trunk. Not a convenient feature."

The quality of workmanship was the best I've ever seen in my 53 years of owning and driving all kinds of cars. 0 defects, good fitment, quality throughout. As good over better than any foreign car or truck I've ever been exposed to. Thinks I, ""They've finally got it right"".  "
cadillac,sts,2008,richcory, 10/28/2009,Very Happy,5,"Wife and I bought our 08 STS V8 in March of this year and it had 13000 miles on it.  We like it so much that we have driven to to Vegas, Denver and Ohio from our home in Oklahoma.  Wife drives it every day to work and another 13000 miles later we couldn't be happier with our purchase.  On the trip to Vegas and back we averaged 30 MPG with 4 adults and trunk full of luggage.  Sound system is the best of any factory system available.  Nav is good but could be more user friendly.  Interior storage space could be improved upon and the glove box is a joke.  Overall a great car with lots of performace and fun to drive.  It's performace isn't that far off from my 94 Vette."
cadillac,sts,2008,impatient, 02/03/2008,Four months with the Caddy,4,"I was really excited about getting this car.  I wanted the Bluetooth capability and ordered the vehicle when I discovered it was included.  However, the voice recognition system is quite faulty as it just does not work properly.  Cadillac just installed a second nav radio to combat this problem and still it does not respond to voice commands.  When a command is given, it responds three times with ""Pardon"" and then says ""Command not recognized.""  Because of this, I am not able to make telephone calls except when the vehicle is in park. Not at all convenient.  Maybe Cadillac will fix this problem.  I hope so."
cadillac,sts,2008,Dominic, 10/09/2007,Love the new STS,5,"I just traded in my 2003 v-8 FWD SLS for a new 2008 v-6 STS RWD.  Having driven the '03 for 4 years and the '08 for only a few weeks short weeks, I can say that the '08 is by far a better car. That is not to say anything bad about the '03, just that Cadillac got it right with this one. RWD, IMHO, is a much better way to design and build this class of car. I got the car pretty much loaded up.  Sticker was ~$54K. The larger 18"" wheels included in the 1SC Luxury Performance package, along with the HD brakes really make this a driving machine.   "
cadillac,sts,2008,Cosmo, 08/20/2007,Outstanding Value for the Money,4,"08 has great looks and comfort.  New V6 ans sheet metal improvements creates great appeal.  Was looking at BMW, Mercedes Audi, Lexus and Infiniti for the money the STS was the best buy, "
cadillac,sts,2008,Hugh, 11/12/2007,No Disappointments!,5,"We enjoy driving this car and both want to drive when we go.  Handles fantastic and could not be quieter. The direct injected six is more powerful than my old Seville V8, has more horsepower. The mileage is better than the 2001 Seville as well. Interior finish is tops, the programing features took some time to master for the memory feature. Very happy with this car and no bag of money had to go to Japan!"
cadillac,sts,2008,onia, 04/05/2008,Great Car,4,"First off, I am in full agreement with all preceding reviews. And I wonder why I haven't seen (in last eight months) any media promotion, a  commercial or even a simple ad for this sophisticated competitor to the Lexus, Infiniti, BMW, and Benz types. Incidentally, there isn't even any dedicated 2008 STS Forum on Edmunds yet! The only three minuses on the car are the lack of space inside ""for stuff"" (where to put glasses?), small trunk and overcomplicated nav system, which is, in fact, inferior for instance to the 5-year older 2003 CTS system."
cadillac,sts,2008,jeff, 04/08/2008,my turn,4,"Love the car.  But difficult to get out of it. Doors seem a bit small.  GPS advanced, difficult to learn.  Dealer should specifically have someone to spend 30 to 45 minutes with you to review.  Would make life easier first few days.  Overall very happy and doing better on gas after 350 miles than I expected"
cadillac,sts,2008,Mark, 04/18/2008,Love this car!,4,"I test drove a CTS first. It was just Ok. I then drove the STS and Wow. I was sold!  Big difference.  They want to sell you a CTS at sticker b/c they make more $ on them, but the STS is worth the extra money, it is much more car.  Smooth, quiet, luxurious. This is quite simply a nicer car than the  5- series BMW and E-Class Mercedes without the price tag of the BMW or the poor quality of the Mercedes.  I could not tell the difference in performance test driving the V-8 and V-6.  The DI V6 feels like a V-8.  This car simply babies you.  Frustrating that you can't get AWD with all the toys in the V-6.  I opted for all the toys on a RWD with the 18"" chrome wheels package - Car looks awesome."
cadillac,sts,2008,OKrahoma, 05/18/2008,I Love My Boomer Sooner Red STS!,5,"This is my first Cadillac, & I love it!  Everywhere I go, people tell me it is a beautiful car.  I love the red of this car, & I love all of the chrome. We took it on a 2500 mile trip two months after buying it, & had a wonderful drive.  We did have a problem when pulling over on the highway to change drivers. A rain- filled pot-hole crumpled the front end, not noticeable on the outside.  A simple call to OnStar led us to the nearest dealer. The only option we did not get was the navigation system, & I'm fine with that! My husband had wanted a Chrysler 300, & I sold him on this, & so far, he's happy with the car, & me!  I love that smiling front end! (On the car!)"
cadillac,sts,2009,cadillacmike, 12/29/2011,An Underrated (V8) car that we'll miss,4,"While the CTS is the darling sport sedan from Cadillac, the STS was a more refined car with more room, and power (with the NorthStar V8) and better egronomics with regard to the memory seat and wheel recall functions. We have both a CTS (2008 premium ed) and an STS (2009 Platinum ed), so can compare them both. We also had a 2005 CTS and two (still have 1) LT1 Fleetwood Broughams, so we've had a few Cadillacs in recent years
Handling and performance are equal to or superior to the CTS, particularly with NorthStar & the wide 255mm 18"" rear tires (CTS has 235mm front & rear) Interior room is better and the single glass sunroof is quieter.
15 speaker Bose system is very powerful and clear."

BMW naturally emerged as the winner because I was used with it.  But what a surprise, the Caddy STS was as good as the Bimmer 5!  It handled in good composure; was fast and smooth.  It felt a bit lighter and easier to drive than the BMW (for daily commute).  I'd say this car is an athlete in suits.    I can zoom pass many muscle cars without making a sound.  It's very smooth and quiet.  I got 25 mpg in city driving; quite remarkable for a car this powerful.  The Bose audio system is the best I've heard in any cars."
cadillac,sts,2010,Jim, 09/24/2010,Outstanding Car,5,"I bought a Diamond White Platinum Series STS. It is an outstanding car: exceedingly comfortable; quick response; OUTSTANDING fuel economy (city 21 -highway 25+ at 80MPH!).  Superb seating and sound system.  Overly complicated navigation system as I do not find it to be intuitive  I liked Chryslers system much better.  Voice Recognition software is problematic - but I'm learning to deal with it - ticks me off though.  The CTS navigation software is used in the STS, which results in technical glitches. So far Cadillac has not fixed this issue.  Styling is strikingly stunning  it gets a LOT of looks.  Road handling is outstanding.  I feel very safe driving Im very happy to drive this car."
cadillac,sts,2010,Jeff NYC, 01/05/2010,Solid Value,4,"I originally wanted the performance of the 8 cyl.Northstar but with $3.00 gas, I settled for the 302hp DI 6 cylinder. I generally don't like anything with less than 8 cylinders but this STS motor is remarkable. It accelerates like an 8, sounds good and delivers exceptional gas mileage. I thought the trip computer was broken when I averaged 31mpg on a 300 mile highway trip but it was true. The sport gears work well if you want drive aggressively and so far I have had no maintenance issues.The handling is  good for 4100lb luxury car but I must admit that I lean towards more agile cars that have suspension treatmentlike the V-series.STS price (after the deal) is alot less than E350 and 530.

Heavy - it gives you the impression you are in an electric train. If you push it hard it responds. But you are better off with a v8, clearly. It has a ridiculously small gas tank. What were they thinking !). Seats are very hard. Lights are not very good. Great music system not an agile car ( again, needs a v8,  also) "

It not only is an eye catcher it is also eye candy to me!  I always wished to own a Caddy but the lease option works for me.  These cars are performance driven and I like the 6 cylinder engine.  The white diamond paint is to die for!"

cadillac,sts-v,2006,Slo-Mo-Shun, 01/17/2008,Cadillac is back,4,"First, the gentleman who described the STS-V's handling as ""sloppy"" is way off.  As a driver of stock cars, open wheel racers and, currently, shifter karts, I assure you that the STS-V has enough handling to accomplish any manuever that could sanely be attempted on public roads.  This car is nicely placed 80% of the way between an M5 and a Jag R-type.  It is a tad softer than the German cars, but that's more than acceptable to me--if I want to get beat up by a stiff ride, I might as well go to a race track and drive something really fast.  This is the car that persuaded me to get rid of my old BMW 750.  No 5 series or E class car was able to do that."
cadillac,sts-v,2006,K D Long, 11/21/2005,V stands for VAROOM!,5,"WOW, what a blast to drive.  The 2006 Cadillac STS-V provides Corvette-like performance and seats four comfortably, and can carry four golf bags.  The motor pulls like a jet engine all the way to redline, nice and linear.  The brakes are fantastic, you can throw out the anchor over and over again without and noticable fade.   Some people know what it is, many do not.  But the face on the guys with the M3s, Mustangs, and 911s are funny after they get waxed by a Cadillac.  My only complaint is the brake dust on the wheels, they should offer the competition grey like on the 2006 Corvette.  It would hide some of the dust.  This is a superior car to anything I have driven.   Great Job Cadillac & GM!"

cadillac,sts-v,2006,Tom, 12/19/2016,"Fun car, but costly to Maintain",4,"I have owned 2 different 2006 Cadillac STS-V's so I have experience with two different cars of the same year/model.  I found them both to be equal in all areas so it's not like I had a ""Good one"" and a ""bad one"".  The styling of these cars is very good.  I think they are sporty and command attention on the road versus the standard STS.  When everything is functioning properly, performance is VERY good.  (Especially for an ""older"" car)  In 2006, these cars were ridiculously fast, however, by today's standards, they are nothing special. A stock V6 mustang can keep up with a stock STS-V.  A 2015 stock Mustang GT will eat my lunch.  On the down side, cost of ownership is very high.  This car seems always need something repaired and its usually not cheap.  Overall these are fun cars, but be prepared to pay for it!

cadillac,sts-v,2006,john slater, 05/15/2006,Compared the STS-V / M5 / E55 and Bought,5,"Having owned a BMW M5 (2001) and a BMW M3 I wanted more of an every day driver, but stillbe able to  enjoy great performance, handling, acceleration, and stopping power.The STS-VV, E55 and M5 are all great cars, but different. So far I am totaly impressed with the STS-V and am happy with my choice.  My wife, who drives a BMW 740i sport and would never drive an M5 or E55, loves the STS-V."
cadillac,sts-v,2006,miledriver, 04/23/2014,2006 Cadillac STS,2,"Costly car to maintain for sure. Looks pretty good on the outside. I like the steel blue color and wheels but feels cheap and plastic on the inside. Cadillac is not like the Cadillac I grew up with that my Mother always drove. Those cars really seemed to last and were comfortable. This car is not and maybe its because Im use to driving a Lexus and actually know what a quality car feels like. This car now has 105,000 miles and resale is AWFUL to say the least. It does however get the job done to and from work but NO TRIPS!! Don't trust it, feels to lose and its been taken care of is the sad part."
cadillac,sts-v,2006,ThurstyDog, 03/03/2008,Don't Bother w/ STS-V,2,"The engine is fantastic.  The Brembo brakes are the best I have ever owned.  I have had M3s in the past and was looking for a sedan and got a good deal (or so I thought). The car has been the shop for 8 weeks in the first 16 months. Not just for small stuff either, but for items like the transmission shifting to 3rd gear at hwy speeds (that will get your attention and of those behind you). Power steering pump exploding and too many others to count. I have contacted Cadlliac numerous times and they refuse to help.  For a $70+k car you would think that they would give some service consideration, but so far they have disappointed all along. So this will be my 1st and last Caddy. "
cadillac,sts-v,2006,Jeff, 12/07/2005,Cadillac comes up short with the STS-V,3,"The STS-V is a nice step for Cadillac into the performance division of cars but it comes up short in several key areas.  The first thing that you'll notice when you get into the car and start driving is the poor handling.  The car's handling is incredibly sloppy.  The Cadillac reps said thats because it wasn't designed to handle, just go straight.  Well the E55 is faster and the M5 handles better so what does the Cadillac do?  The interior is subpar, with the rear seat using primative HVAC controls.  The front seats are not sport seats and have no side support.  The interior itself is ok, but nothing fantastic."
cadillac,sts-v,2006,SPIKE, 04/21/2006,Traded A8L - wanted PERFORMANCE!,4,"I could not accept the trade-in offer from the local Audi dealer.  He told me to keep my old A8L which kept needing transmission recalibrations.  Plus it did not have fancy options like Blue Tooth etc.  The Caddie runs better, it is quieter, and smoother.  I hate the Pirelli Tires though.  They are harsh and provide a noisy ride.  I will buy Michelins when they are available in this size. I like the interior! The leather is just as good as in the Audi.  I also like the navigation and other features that the Germans still do not have.  The car is smaller, but rides just as well as the Audi.  It is not quite as solid at very high speed, but I don't really need to drive at 130 MPH.  "
cadillac,sts-v,2006,Mark, 02/19/2006,Wonderful!,4,The 2006 Cadillac STS-V is an absolutely wonderful driving machine!  I have it in black.  It draws attention from 100% of all the people at stoplights.  It gets up to 178 mph on my home runway.  It is worth every penny.  The only thing that it needs is a more luxurious colored wood trim.
cadillac,sts-v,2006,Larry B, 03/19/2006,Best Car I Have Ever Owned!,5,"Nothing more to be said - the Cadillac STS-V is the best car that I have ever owned!  It is extremely quick, a treat to drive and an attention getter. You will not be disappointed! The interior is the nicest GM has ever made. "
cadillac,sts-v,2006,Beach Bum, 07/30/2006,STS-V,4,The 2006 Cadillac STS-V has an excellent interior and comfort. Tihs car has a powerful engine that pulls hard. Its overall fit and finish is well done. 
cadillac,sts-v,2006,Dino, 03/29/2020,A wonderful mix of luxury and performance.,5,"This was our first experience with the V Series Cadillac.  We have driven Cadillacs since the late 1970's and fell in love with this car from day one.  It is truly a wonderful mix of luxury and performance. The engine provides plenty of power, the suspension makes mountain driving fun, and the brakes are very well matched to the performance.  Based on our experience with our STS-V we have owned two CTS-V's.  Our first was a 2012 wagon, and our current one is a 2016 sedan.
The higher horsepower of the newer cars can be exciting, but also more challenging to drive with both feet flat on the floor!  The STS-V with it's 469HP/Torque was much more predictable when you choose to drive like you stole it!  If looking for an older luxury sports sedan you won't go wrong with an STS-V.  They are truly a joy to drive!
"
cadillac,sts-v,2007,Greyhound - Rex, 11/15/2006,Yeah Baby,4,"This car is extremely fast and powerful.  It handles like a dream, especially at high speeds.  Its braking is very reliable, but does put a lot of brake dust on the car's rims. "
cadillac,sts-v,2007,Mr. Z, 12/26/2008,I Love this car!,4,"Having owned a 94 STS,97 and a 98, this car surpasses all! Goes like stink, corners like it's on rails, and stops on a dime! Comfortable, notwithstanding the ride caused by the garbage tires. Shredded the rears at 15,000 miles. Never owned a car that got more attention! The younger crowd is more aware than older persons. Look forward to driving it every day."
cadillac,sts-v,2007,Jesse Garcia, 08/26/2006,STS-V Hauls,4,"The STS-V is an overall fun vehicle.  Its fuel economy is poor, but that is to be expected when you have 469 ponies under the hood.  It handles well, accelerates like a raging bull, and handles like a sports car.  I also own a Porsche 911 C4S, and it almost corners just as well.  The interior fit and finish could use some help, but the exterior look is gorgeous.  The stance it has makes it look like its going 100 mph standing still.  Overall, the STS -V is a fun and at the same time practical sedan."
cadillac,sts-v,2007,JP, 08/28/2008,Excessive tire noise,4,"I love the car except head height, and excessive tire noise, The run-flat Pirellis are so loud at 65 mph it is hard to hear the radio or have a conversation without yelling, 100 db of noise!. I plan to take the run- flats off, will need to get a spare wheel and jack though. Cadillac was no help. I asked cooperate for help with this, They said ""So sad too bad"" :("

cadillac,sts-v,2007,BurninLove, 04/24/2007,What an amazing Car!,4,I owned a STS-4 prior to owning a new 2007 STS-V. The V is an amazing car and it's scary fast! Even looks cool when its standing still. The interior is a step up from my loaded out STS-4. Nice stiching and quality leather is used through out the interior. The surround sound is an amazing feature with some of the best sounds I have ever heard out of a car. The STS-V screams as it goes down the road. I amazing car that I would own time and time again.
cadillac,sts-v,2007,ty, 08/25/2007,Superfast!,4,"The car is awsome! Great power, handiling, and braking. I have been told it looks like it's going 100mph sitting still! The car was pricey but so worth it every time I mash the throttle!"
cadillac,sts-v,2007,JS, 09/23/2007,Exceptional Cadillac,4,"I purchased the STS-V in late June 2007. The car has performed extraordinarily well.  I do a fair amount of driving on back roads and the handling of this vehicle is superb around bends and winding roads.  There have been no squeaks or rattles. The car is tightly built. Gas mileage is similar to a large SUV. I am getting around 15 mpg around town which is slightly better than the rated mileage. One aspect of the car that you don't fully appreciate during the test drive is how well the driver seat holds the driver in place during cornering. The seat design is superior to that of most cars in this class. Mechanically, the engine and transmission operate very smoothly. "
cadillac,sts-v,2007,matmat673, 12/07/2007,Crazy Car,4,"Overall, one of the best cars I've ever driven. Great power (tough to handle in the snow), but pulls like a train at any speed.  Competitive mode driving is an absolute hoot!   Fuel economy, like the other ratings, is a similar to my Tahoe.  With a little encouragement from $3+/gallon gas, can manage 22+mpg on the highway.  One issue with gas gauge floating up and down alot, not sure exactly how much gas is in it if I take corners hard and hit the accelerator.   Many compliments, many on-takers at every light, and gets alot of attention everywhere. Well worth the price!"
cadillac,sts-v,2008,GTT, 12/23/2008,Beautiful Automobile,4,"Bought the STS V the first week of December and have taken a couple of 300 mile trips in it.

You forget you're driving a big Caddy and think you're in a very fast sports car."

Negociate a spair from the dealer and regular preformace tiers BEFORE you purchase.  I put on Toyo tiers, no trade in they have a back room full of Perelli run flats that been taken off... GM said toooo bad so sad...I should haven test drove on the freeway."

cadillac,sts-v,2009,The Gentleman, 07/21/2010,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,4,"This is the ultimate sleeper performance sedan.  I did add ""supercharged"" to both sides of the hood cowl.  At speed it seems to get smoother.  It does so many things well that it is hard to fault the car.  I get better mileage than the sticker, 21 MPG at 75 MPH.  Simply going for a drive will make you smile."

Fast, quiet, steady at speed but the rides a bit jiggly on the OEM run flats...will swap  for the Pilot A/S Plus. Very nice car at a great price"

I get more thumbs up from other convertible drivers (Porsche comes to mind), teens, general passersby, than I ever have with another vehicle.  This car is a beauty, comfortable, fun to drive, fast, and well designed.  You'll really want to exceed the speed limit in this one, it is so smooth.

They should have more interior color

to tell everyone that if you are 
looking for style, comfort, and the 
finer things in life, and have $75,000 
to buy it, then this is your car.  On 
the other hand, it basicly has the same 
engine and my 1996 Mustang Cobra 4.6L 
8cyl 5 speed and I payed a lot less for 
that car then I did this one. So in my 
opinion its not worth the price, I only 
payed for the Cadillac symbol on the 
front grill. "

Cadillac XLR last Fall throughout the 
12 years I owned the Jaguar, I never 
once saw a vehicle that came close to 
it in style, performance & comfort, nor 
did I ever contemplate replacing it.The 
XLR's debut changed my attitude almost 
the moment I first saw it. During the 
nearly five months I have owned my 
black XLR, I have consistently 
experienced pure pleasure in driving 
it. Not only does it ""turn heads"", it 
handles and performs flawlessly and 
with power to spare.I never cease to be

cadillac,xlr,2005,qgsm33, 01/08/2007,"Bought It Used, Saved Depreciation",4,"I looked hard at the Mercedes SLK55 and the SL500.  I couldn't afford the SL500 (ouch).  The regular SLKs (350, 280, etc) didn't have enough horsepower to really compare.  The SLK55 was almost impossible to find used with fairly low miles.  Although the SLK55 is a great car, it just seemed too small for me.  My daughter said ""you look like an elephant riding a peanut"" (referring to the short wheel base and short overall car length).  Mercedes made a big deal out of their hard top retracting in 19 seconds vs. 30 seconds for the Caddy.  My only trouble on the Caddy has been the computer thinking the top isn't fully locked when you hit a hard bump.  That has been fixed now via some reprogramming."
cadillac,xlr,2005,DRB, 06/13/2005,From a Cadillac Technican's Point of Veiw,3,"The 2005 Cadillac XLR has great perforance, with only a slight under steer at 130 mph.  With the ground effects the chassis does a nice job sticking you to the road. The slap stick / shifter is pretty cool with the HUD system and the cruise control great. With this system, the XLR matches the speed of the slower car ahead of it until either you switch lanes or the slower car ahead of you speeds up, then your set speed on the cruise control returns to your set speed. How cool is that! The downfall is with the top down ther is very little room in the trunk, no place for those golf clubs to go with the roof down.  I have seen a lot of folding top repairs already and miss aligned rear quarter glass misfits.  Aftermarket wheels seem to mess up the ride."

cadillac,xlr,2005,edwestrfld, 06/11/2005,2 years of ownership,4,"The car is a blast to drive and always turns heads on the road.  I have lost count of the number of people giving me the thumbs up.  The XLR has been a solid performer.  I had one computer chip issue in the first two months, which was quickly fixed.  My car was one of the first off the line, and had brake squeal with low speed stops.  Cadillac replaced all four rotors with upgrades.  All subsequent cars produced have the same rotors.  Have had one chip in the paint on the retractable roof.  External trunk release was replaced. You do have to tell the carwash guys the trunk is ""powered"" and you don't close it by hand.  Also has a hidden panel they inevitably don't clean.  "
cadillac,xlr,2005,Rick Benson, 11/17/2004,XLR - LEMON,3,"I HAVE OWNED (9) Cadillacs over the 
past (14) and have been extremely 
satisfied with each one.  In February 
2004 I received my dream car, only it 
turned out being a nightmare.  The 
problems started at 430 miles.  Lights 
that did not work, windows switches 
defective, inability to start.  XLR 
had to be towed on a flatbed twice, 
back to the delarship.  One of the 
fuel tanks had to be replaced, ""check 
fuel cap"" message continuosly on 
drivers information center.  Less than 
13 MPG on open road and highway 
driving. Engine misfiring, engine 
leaking 1/2 - 1 pint of oil everytime 
it was shut off.  Various other 
electrical problems.  Navigation 
System works about 1/3 of the time.   
In the shop 40 days."
cadillac,xlr,2005,Chris O, 12/05/2004,Cadillac joins the Big League,4,"If the crisp creases of the XLR's lines get your 
attention right away, then the cockpit comfort and 
layout just reinforce the fact that Cadillac has built 
one seriious sports car. It has all the gizmos, and some, 
but all serve to enhance the driving experrience and 
not confuse and overtwhelm the enthusiast. It is quick 
of the blocks, but with finesse rather than 
machismo.  The XLR's handling is precise and 
exhilerating. The retractable top is an engineering 
masterpice and delivers a whisper quiet interrior 
when up, and a head turning air in the hair thrill 
when stowed. Its clean lines, luxury, and power 
combine to deliver a grand touring roadster to 
compete with the best Europe has to offer. "
cadillac,xlr,2005,John L Martin, 04/21/2005,New Cadillac XLR 2005,5,"The new 2005 Cadillac XLR competes easily with the Mercedes-Benz SL500 and has in my examination surppassed the it  for ease of driver use.  Cadillac's XLR technology integration is the best in its class. The edge in overall performance goes to the XLR. The interior luxury is on par with the SL500 with the XLR's looking more modern. Its general styling best in its class.  Its comtemporary edge makes heads turn. Everyday driving is where the XLR excels with all features standard except for XM digital radio. In summary, the Cadillac XLR is sitting at the first position in luxury sports roadsters when you consider the price."
cadillac,xlr,2005,SR, 05/20/2005,Cadillac XLR,4,"I have previously owned Lexus products including the SC430 and I feel that the Americans, specifically Cadillac have hit the mark on the XLR.  It is more powerful, more advanced and certainly more fun to dry than the Lexus.  This is remarkable considering that the Lexus is one of the best cars in the world.  I feel that the XLR proves that American automakers can, when they want, build a car that is second to none."
cadillac,xlr,2005,Frank, 09/01/2005,Needs more trunk space,4,"Wow- Car gets the looks, I wish the wood grain would not scrach so easy. Fun to drive with top down. Radio needs better antenna, but sound is great. "
cadillac,xlr,2005,Chris, 06/10/2005,out too soon?,3,"Many details were missed in my Cadillac XLR.  For example, when you raise the trunk lid outside in the rain the water drains off the forward lid and into the trunk. This causes a damp, musty odor and wets anything inside.  The electronics on the car are very complicated and the owner's manual is poorly written.  If a passenger who is not familiar with the car is left inside without a fob, they can't get out. This is very dangerous in an emergency!  There is an electrical drain on the battery. When my car not used 2 or 3 days the battery dies. This has happened 3 times in 18 months requiring road service.  Most of the aforemtioned problems are fixable and would make the ownership experience much more enjoyable, but Cadillac has a deaf ear!"
cadillac,xlr,2005,BobJ, 04/30/2005,2005 Cadillac XLR,4,"My 2005 Cadillac XLR has been better than I expected in terms of being fun to drive and the build quality.  I have not had any problems with it at all at all after six months of ownership.  Heads turn constantly when I drive by.  This car is faster than I can go, quicker than I need, and turns and brakes better than my last Porsche.  My oonly problem with it, and this is a minor gripe, is that when backing out of a parking space, the roll bar partially blocks my view."
cadillac,xlr,2005,Elizabeth Henderson, 07/10/2004,My XLR,4,"I love my XlR, it's sporty and goes 
very fast!  Although, it has been in 
the shop for repairs many times!  It 
had to have a new rear end put in, the 
air conditioner worked on and the speed 
control worked on.  But all in all it's 
a beautiful car, not for long trips not 
much trunk space and really not that 
comfortable after 8hrs.  My husband 
thinks the driver's seat is very 
uncomfortable but I don't.  I feel bad 
that I rated the relibility of it 
poorly, we have had Cad. for a long 
time and never had much trouble.  Our 
dealer is very nice and always has a 
loaner car ready for us.  Maybe because 
it's so new we just have to get the 
bugs out.  "
cadillac,xlr,2005,Fibbidiboo, 08/07/2005,"First Cadillac, no surprises",3,"Frankly, I must be naive. Thinking GM- the large bank that also makes cars- could compete with the finest autos from Lexus, BMW and Mercedes reveals a sudden lapse in judgment. Yes, the Eucalyptus wood is beautiful but the bin doors are pure Cavalier quality. Sure the design is provacative, but evidently engineer imagination must have been worn out by the time they got to the wheels. I mean do all new Cadillac shoes have to look the same? But the biggest clue to engineering misfires evidenced itself on a recent 1,200 mile trip in which the heat from the transmission tunnel fused my vitamins together in the trunk. And getting it to recognize the FOB so that I can start it is a hope/prayer."
cadillac,xlr,2005,David Toth, 07/08/2009,World Class Car,5,"This car blows the BMW's that I have been driving off the road.  The XLR is fast, handles great, and extremely comfortable.

cadillac,xlr,2005,HOWDY, 12/02/2004,Cadillac XLR,5,"My new 2005 Cadillac XLR is my second one.  I purchased an early 2004 model and it was great.  It turned heads and was enjoyable to drive.  I had very few problems with it, considering that it was such a new model.  I purchased a 2005 XLR without any reservations.  From the perspective of a previous Chevrolet Corvette fanatic, this is an excellent car."
cadillac,xlr,2005,Matt Lucchese, 05/27/2005,Corvette with Class,4,"The Cadillac XLR is absolutly fantastic! it handles as well as my best friend's Chevrolet Corvette, but it isn't as fast.  The car looks much better than the 'vette, and with the luxurious interior, is much more comfortable than it.  Having the hardtop convertible is the best feature of the car because you'll never have the old rag look."
cadillac,xlr,2005,greg holloway, 05/29/2005,Excellent Car to Drive,5,"The exterior and interior look of the Cadillac XLR ""turns heads"" everywhere you go.  Its power and handling feel like a race car.  No car make compares with the comfort of Cadillac and the interior seats, by comparison to all other two door sports cars, is unparallelled.  Its strong standard features do not make you want to do add ons.  This is an exceptional car - GM did this right. "

I have been a Chevrolet Corvette nut for many years (from 1965 on - and have owned several).  The XLR fits better for comfort and style.  Instead of the old Corvette wave, the XLR demands the ogle of admiration from those who see it on the road.  There still are not very many out there."
cadillac,xlr,2005,Charley Dickey, 06/02/2005,Birthday Present from Wife,4,"I love 2005 Cadillac XLR.  I can change it from hard top to convertible at a stop light!  It is a pleasure to drive.  Unfortunately, its luggage space with the top down is practically nil."
cadillac,xlr,2005,caddy lover, 06/10/2005,AWESOME,5,"I have driven the Cadillac  XLR and it is amazing, better than I would have expected. I got more stares from people than with my Mercedes-Benz. Its just a great car, which few people have which makes it even better."
cadillac,xlr,2005,LeeRoyLRT, 08/17/2005,A Great Car - Fun to Drive,5,"This is one fine automobile. Quality inside and out. Very quite with great performance. Finally a true sports car with luxury. I love the crash avoidance system, yes you may call it cruise control, but on the way home from a trip and it senses vehicles in front of me in a torrential down pour and I am only going 47 mph and I can't see them. I think much more highly of this option than of normal cruise control. Go GM, especially Cadillac."
cadillac,xlr,2005,XL R Roadster, 05/18/2006,An Excellant Review,4,"I had always wanted a Corvette and had been looking at Corvettes.  I took my Cadillac DeVille in for service and they were asking me when I was going to trade.  I told them I was wanting something different.  They told me about the XLR that was coming out.  When they got one in they called me to look at it and I fell in love with it.  It is so much fun to drive and really turns heads.  I have a second car and I don't drive it every day.  I took a trip to Lafayette, LA and it was a pleasure.  It is totally a sports car.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this car."

Cadillac had not figured out where to put the XM antenna, which is now located on center of the trunk lid. I miss having XM radio, but will order it on a new 2006 XLR. This is a nice car and it is very confortable on long trips."
cadillac,xlr,2005,DrZ89, 06/18/2005,Great Ride,4,I have owned a lot of cars but this is by far the best car I've owned. It is a great car to put the top down and hit the open road.  The car is comfortable to drive and handles like a dream. I can get in and out of the car without feeling like I have to climb or roll. The car gets looks wherever I go. I can't imagine ever selling this car.    
cadillac,xlr,2005,jabben, 07/12/2005,Cadillac XLR,4,Everthing I had expected is coming true as this baby boomer really wanted a fast and exciting entry level two seater. It excellent and quick to respond. The oil life seems to be okay and gas mileage okay. I have never been in a vechicle that people have given there thumbs up on the style of it. 
cadillac,xlr,2005,GoVols, 08/13/2006,"XLR, Best of the Breed",4,"This is the most commented-on car I have had since I owned a 1973 Jaguar E-Type V12 in the 70's.  It has power, performance, comfort and (most of all) style.  From its front angles it looks like the Batmobile.  I am very happy with the car.  The only problem is the touch screen for audio/mav/etc. is unreadable with the top down on a sunny day."

With the top up, you have no idea you are in a roadster! It is so quiet.  No problems with the car so far . Purchased on 7-8- 09 with 7295 miles. It is quite different from our 07 Corvette.  We considered a 2010 Camaro...love the exterior looks, but inside was a disappointment (seats, dash, short windshield). Back to the XLR..CD player has awesome sound...love the cooled seats.  Think this will be a collectible car. Got this like new 06 for about half of the original list. My wife says the car is ""cool""!"

cadillac,xlr,2006,Bob, 08/18/2008,buy the benz,3,"After looking for one of these since Nov 07,  and reading all the reviews I bought anyway. I have had 2 weeks and its been in shop for 6 days,  for heated/cooled seats,  and horn.  Going back tomorrow for fog lights and high beam flash. Make sure only buy certified and get vis records.  These are very high maintenance cars and while they look good,  they are not built like a 75k car. Buy the Benz,  more money but you should actually get to drive it,  instead of rental cars. Certification provides warranty,  but doesn't mean they actually checked.  I had not driven 2 feet after delivered certified when the above were not working. Don't feel sorry for gm or employees,  they need to do job. "

This one is a lemon.. Almost every 2 weeks I was spending $800 on something to have it fixed.. Extended warranity was worthless. Replaced both window regulators 800 each.  Then transmission cable broke $400   As a single woman repair cost has cost me my car. I can't keep up with repair bills  But truly love driving this car with top down and up.

It was diagnosed by the dealer as ""inappropriate spark detonation"" the problem has still not been solved even after three more visits to the dealer and a ""site visit"" by Cadillac's engineer.  The car has been out of service for nearly a month since I purchase it, with no end in sight.  I also own a new Cadillac STS, and there is no comparison between the cars.  It is a shame that Cadillac cannot seem to get it right.  Next time, it'll be a Mercedes-Benz SL500."
cadillac,xlr,2006,XLRer8, 08/24/2006,I'm Lovin' It,4,"I have had zero problems with my Cadillac XLR!  It is a real head turner.  Every hotel or restaurant I take it to parks it in the front.  I'm a big guy and fit into it with no problems.  I wish I had waited for the V-series though.  In twelve months I have only seen three others on the road.  There is millions of Mercedes SL500s out there, but very few of these."
cadillac,xlr,2006,jimbo, 11/14/2007,XLR - Great car - but . . . .,3,"While a very unique vehicle - those seeking a luxury sports car will find it falls short of the XK, SL, 6xx series vehicles.  It's Corvette heritage is very obvious and in the supercharged version has good performance (non-supercharged is a bit ""wanting"" IMHO).  The lack of any type of storage behind the seats really makes this a challenge when traveling.  Also with the top down - storage is practically zip - especially when compared with the SL."

cadillac,xlr,2006,Race Addington, 11/13/2007,2006 XLR,4,"This is my 2nd Cadillac, 1st was 2005 CTS. The XLR is a sporty, good looking car that attracts a lot of attension. The only complant is the lack of knowledge for repairs and maintence and it's common malfunctions of computer driven systems.  Also for such an expensive car the FM raido reception system is weak and some interior items are built cheaply such as visors, visor mirrors and storage compartments between seats. Other than that, the car is a great ride.  Note: Watch out for the cops, they seem attracted to expensive look and don't take kindly to top down and music loud."
cadillac,xlr,2006,domesticdude, 03/25/2008,"Great Car, Little Nitpicks",4,"Every time i walk into my garage i just stare in awe for a few seconds. With this parked next to my 2007 XKR it is a sight to see. The XLR is one of the best head turning cars period. It just looks incredible, and when you add the retractable hardtop thats reason enough to buy it. I have the regular XLR and it is quick, but one can tell it needs a little more power and desperately needs a better exhaust note. The interior is a little cramped, i'm 6 ft tall, and lacks storage. Personally i like the interior, its nice enough and is very user friendly, though it could be nicer. IT is just a great overall car."
cadillac,xlr,2006,Mark Zachary, 02/10/2009,Rare Fun Car,4,"A Rare car among more common luxury convertibles on the road. Plenty of power for a 2 seater, handles well. Smooth, stable ride on highway and side roads.  Comfortable, well equipped interior.   A Fun car to drive, especially on warm, sunny days with the top down.  Eye catching exterior is noticed wherever you travel. Be warned.....this vehicle often attracts the interest of complete strangers but I've met some great people who enjoy unique, fun automobiles like the XLR as much as I do.  Buy One and Have Fun! "
cadillac,xlr,2006,kervin, 12/26/2005,Great car,5,"The Cadillac XLR is a much beter car than the Lexus SC430 that I traded in. I love the interior design, it has just the right amount of wood to vinyl to aluminum trim. This cash has much superior technology to the Lexus SC430, HUD, cruise control, FOB, magnetic ride control, and the Northstar engine technology."
cadillac,xlr,2006,John, 07/20/2005,2006 Cadillac XLR,4,"My Cadillac XLR has no truck room. I parked the car in Soho, NYC to see people's reaction on a Sunday afternoon. 30% of people stopped to look at the car and some took out their phone camera. It drives like a GM car, it does not have stiff handling. At high speed I want the stiffness."
cadillac,xlr,2006,TerryLee, 05/31/2006,"Fits like a glove, smooth and sexy",5,"The Cadillac XLR is a fine, classic car for ladies.  It has power when needed with just a touch on the gas pedal.  It rides smooth and sleek.  It has the look and makes a lady look good.  It's sexy.  It fits me like a fine, leather glove.  I love the hard top.  This car has plenty of trunk space for my expensive luggage for a week's trip, even in golc weather.  It's technically sleek.  Its speakers surround you with sound.  And, a ride under the stars on a warm, summer night will knock your socks off."
cadillac,xlr,2006,caddyguy, 12/10/2005,My new 2006 XLR,4,"I just purchased my first new car in my 55 years. I will update this as time passes, but I am pumped about the XLR. It is stunningly beautiful top up or down, and quick and sure on the road. I am hard pressed to understand the marginal reviews of the interior - I find the appointments commensurate for a rig in this price range. The seats adjust to dreamy perfection, the lights and overall vision are excellent. Not being a computer geek type, it is going to take some time to adapt to all the 170 voice commands the car responds to. The hands free phone was a hit with me right off, as is the free OnStar for a year, and XM radio for three months."
cadillac,xlr,2006,Jay, 10/16/2005,Star Black,4,"I purchased this car in Cathedral City, CA and drove it cross country to FL.  What a joy! The handling and ride were outstanding. This is my dream car, I can't even imagine anything topping it, although I am sure they will in years to come."
cadillac,xlr,2006,Lance, 02/23/2007,WOW!,4,"I love my new car. It is somewhat rare and a real head turner. I moved up to it from an '06 Vette. I have had some issues with the GPS not logging in, but it should be fixed soon."
cadillac,xlr,2006,Jon, 09/20/2005,Outstanding Value,4,Having just purchased a 2006 Cadillac XLR Limited Edition model...it has lived up to or surpassed my expectations. It has a wonderful ride and much more storage than I would have expected. It's a true pleasure to drive. It's definitely not your Daddy's Caddy!
cadillac,xlr,2006,wily, 07/07/2005,XLR Turns Heads,4,The XLR is the perfect car to cruise the boulevard and turn heads from young and old alike. We just like to drive around and watch people watch us.  So many come up to us when parked that we have made new friends all up and down the east coast. It sounds like a hot rod and doesn't disappoint on performance.  The car has all the luxury features one could ask for though cabin storage is really non-existant.
cadillac,xlr,2006,G G Johnston, 12/27/2005,2006 XLR,5,"This is the finest car I have ever owned. The styling and performance are equal to the Mercedes-Benz SL500 but about $25,000 dollars less. It should be recognized by more auto writers as a superb vehicle."
cadillac,xlr,2006,GoldenGirl, 11/22/2006,XLR Review,4,The driving and power performance of this vehicle are overwhelming.  I love the way it handles and takes corners.  It hugs the road.  It has a luxurious interior and easy to get to controls.  The hard top convertible is an eye-catcher and people always stare and comment what a beautiful car this is.
cadillac,xlr,2007,Lance Elliott, 03/05/2008,Nothing turns heads like a red Cadillac,4,"Having owned many new Cadillac's I dreamed of an XLR since they first hit the market in 2004. I can say with my XLR it has been a love/hate relationship, with love still winning over my hate of some issues with the car. "
cadillac,xlr,2007,Bernie, 12/21/2007,I love it,4,"I spent a long time deciding whether I wanted to spend the money for this car.  Strange as it may seem, I also considered the Saturn Sky which is a terrific looking car. I've owned a convertible before and knew that if I ever owned one again it would have to have a power hard top with a glass rear window.  The XLR looks great and is fun to drive.  Gas mileage on the highway has been far better than expected too! "
cadillac,xlr,2007,twathen, 08/13/2006,XLR Update,5,"The Cadillac XLR is the most enjoyable and fascinating auto I've ever owned, including Ferrari and Mercedes.  It is responsive and truly a quality built auto.  It is the best vehicle ever owned."
cadillac,xlr,2007,Ron Conrad, 06/29/2010,Review and a question about transmission,4,"I previously owned an SL-320, then picked up an 07 XLR while in Fla. this winter. I love it, think it is drop- dead beautiful. Averaged 27 mpg coming up 95 at 75 mph. I've noticed a random clunk in the transmission when moving in slow traffic at about 18 mph. Anyone else notice this? Only happens when very slow stop and go situations. This is a more luxurious car than my 97 SL was. Any input about the transmission would help. Ron"
cadillac,xlr,2007,Bonnie Hudson, 03/07/2007,It's a Wow!,5,"What a fabulous looking car!  I had five Jags before this one and they can't compare to the new XLR. It has a beautifully appointed interior with burled Ash wood trim, leather that  is color co-ordinated with exterior and interior and a suede headliner.  It runs like a dream and does everything for you, especially the adaptive cruise control which means you can literally take your foot off the pedals.  I LOVE the way the hard-top folds (like a piece of origami) into the trunk. I also love the color (a subtle purple), the automatic locking doors on both sides, and the heads-up driving feature is just fabulous! It's made so beautifully.  This car simply has it all!"
cadillac,xlr,2007,James, 01/11/2020,I've been driving luxury cars since 1963,5,"I have been asked to update my comments on my 2007 XLR Cadillac. I am pleased to report that my observations regarding this extraordinary car have not changed. Having owned dozens of luxury automobiles during my 74 years, I can report that the XLR is an extraordinary piece of automotive engineering and design.  The magnetic ride smooths road surfaces,  the steering is tight, and the engine and transmission are perfectly matched.  It is an extraordinarily well built car (in fact, hand built!),  and provides the kind of pride of ownership that is lasting because it is simply so beautiful, durable, and exciting to drive and own. I encourage any reader who is considering a used sports car to test drive one of these. These cars are, simply stated, superb in every conceivable fashion.
"
cadillac,xlr,2008,Scott Leyva, 10/17/2009,All smiles,4,"I love my XLR-V and it makes me happy to get behind the wheel.  It has had its share of problems including a leaky radiator and a bad supercharger air pump that started making groaning noises.  It is definitely high maintenance including light bulb replacement that took the dealership one hour to get to it to replace.  Also, one time the top stopped half way and we had to use the key in the bumper to get it closed manually.  It never happened again so the car has its own personality.  This car is red and draws a crowd wherever I go!  Not even my 95 Jaguar XJS, which I traded in, drew this much attention from young and old alike.  I just hope it is lower maintenance than the Jaguar!"
cadillac,xlr,2008,Don Decker, 10/30/2017,Cadillac XLR,2,"After Extensive Searches, and Reading Many Reviews, all I can say is: BUYERS BE AWARE!!                                                                                                                              What the Dealerships, and Salespersons won't tell you is that there are NO Replacement Body, Bumpers, Light Assemblies, or Trim Parts available anywhere, USA or Abroad, not even After Market for this Short Manufacturing Run Car (2004 through 2009) making Insurance Extremely Expensive if you can find someone to Insure it. Great Performance Car, Handles Great, Comfortable to ride in, but Poor Mileage. Might be a Good Car for someone who collects cars, and has plenty of Mad Money to play with.

The First thing everyone expresses is the Sharpness of the Composite Stealth Look..  After that and in order is the inside beauty, then the Top, then the Windshield Display after starting with the Keyless Entry.. Once on the streets and highway it is the unsurpassed Thrill of pure POWER that puts an over welming smile on the Drivers Face and the Braking and Steering is unreal it is so good.. The Advanced Radar Cruise Control is incredible and works flawlessly.. On twisty roads at night the 15 degree ""Turn with the road"" lights are Great..

When I was looking for something new and fun, Of course I looked at the C6 Vette's but I liked the interior and exterior color combos they both offered. I prefer this color of the infared and Shale color combo over any the Corvette had to offer. Plus this car rides great. With it's weight distribution of 50/50, I have not broken the rear end loose once driving the Ca. Sierra roads. Just a wonderful car. Very much a hear turner everywhere I go.

cadillac,xlr-v,2006,Army Al, 05/15/2019,The New Grandpa's Cadillac,4,"Before purchasing the XLR V, only 2,188 were produced, I test drove the Base model XLR over 13,500 produced as well. My only comment on the V model is that it's an upgraded base model on steroids. Love the additional supercharged power, acceleration and the sound of the engine when the pedal is put to the metal. I only participate in car shows and average 800 miles yearly. 9.9 times out of 10 times, it's the only XLR V in attendance surrounded by Ferraris, Lambos, MBZs, BMWs, Jaguars, Teslas and other exotic cars. Haven't had any mechanical issues since my initial purchase in Nov 2014. Counting my lucky stars when I hit the starter button. Buy it, drive it, if you want daily attention. As a senior citizen, I'm in the 4th quarter of my life and the XLR V will take me to my end game with a smile on my face. A previous Vette and Porsche owner and they don't even come close IMHO. Since the car is out of production as of 2009, certain spare parts are impossible to find. Example, head and tail lights. Don't have an accident.

cadillac,xlr-v,2006,John Winant, 05/18/2006,GM's Secret Head Turner,4,"I bought the XLR-V because I wanted something new and different. The car had a beautiful look. I've had it for almost two years and I love it. People walk up to me and tell me that my car is outstanding. I've had no problems with this car, only one minor recall for programing. I would recomend the XLR very highly."
cadillac,xlr-v,2006,2006 Cadillac XLR-V, 11/16/2006,The XLR-V is a Great Car,5,"This is the best car for driving, looking and owning.  It's the greatest car that I have ever owned.  Its acceleration and handling couldn't be better."
cadillac,xlr-v,2006,STEPHEN HOLM, 11/25/2006,Almost Perfect,4,"I have owned several head turning cars and motor cycles, but this beats them all.  From old ladies to young men and kids, people have chased me through parking lots and tried to flag me down on the street, just to get a look and learn more about it.  They are usually shocked to find out that it is a Cadillac.  Yes, this happens to the point it that it is a problem.  Aside from that, it is great fun to drive.  The acceleration and handling are so very nice, yet the car is so refined. It is simply a refined ""wildcar"". It has an amazingly fantastic aftermarket sound (meaning the engine).  The great sound system is stock."
cadillac,xlr-v,2006,david, 12/16/2006,Davy's Baby SLR - VVroooom,4,"This is the fastest car I have ever had. It drives extremely smoothly and has great power with a bit of a whine like I have heard on newer airplanes. It drives great, however, I am not a high tech guy and this car is high tech. It take a lot of effort to ot to learn to appreciate everything. It comes with a pre-packaged cell phone and OnStar, which is very cool. This car is sharp.  I love the power and am surprised that I haven't been pulled over yet.  The high tech features make it attractive to others that haven't seen the digital info projected like 3D over the steering wheel at the front of the car. The radio blares and for a sports car.  It has a very smooth ride."
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,AL, 10/17/2006,Love It,4,"I just wanted something different than my BMW convertible that I have driven since 1977.  I love this car.  It is a thrilling experience to drive.  No, it does not handle like my BMW but it is a nice change.  I will get snow tires and hope that it will take me safely in the winter months ahead. I call it ""My Batmobile"" it reminds me of Batman's car.  It is a beautiful change for me and my husband.  If you are looking for an automobile with fuel economy--this is not the one for you.  All and all I just love it."
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,James Landi, 11/07/2017,The incomparable luxury roadster,5,"Edmunds asked me to up date my initial review from over a year ago, ostensibly, to determine if I still felt as I did. What follows is my original review, and I happily report to you that my XLR still engages and satisfies me as it originally ""WOWED"" me. So what follows is my original review... It's hard for me not to take second, third and fourth looks at my Infra-red 2007 XLR when it's parked. It looks like no other car-- unique from every angle-- a true work of automotive art that was hand built by G.M in their Corvette plant.  This is a sports car that will provide you with the finest,  most quiet, and most comfortable ride on virtually every road surface.  Driven sensibly, it will give you 25 miles to a gallon of gas.  For its time, the electronics were top of the line, but alas, it does not have blue tooth or an audio input into the sound system.  My wife and I selected to purchase ""On _Star and activate the XM.  Aside from having a failsafe navigation system in the car with the cd map, the On Star provides you with audio directions through the Boise sound system  Additionally, each month you receive a mechanical report on the state of your car's many systems--- so you are confident about the car's operation.  The used car values for XLR are relatively steep,  but if you find one with low mileage that has had the benefit of a mature driver you'll be very please with the purchase.  It's the most fun you'll ever have in a car!

cadillac,xlr-v,2007,2007 XLR-V CA, 01/18/2008,2007 Cadillac XLR-V,5,I had this car for about a year. I have had absolutely no problems at all. The quality is outstanding. The power and responsiveness are awesome. A very drive-able vehicle whether in city/freeway traffic or on long weekend excursions. A great machine to drive! 
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,sunidhi, 02/19/2007,The 2007 Cadillac XLR-V,4,I think that this car is really well built.  I had a really fun time driving this car. I hope that other people buy this car and have just as much as fun as I did.
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,Laura, 08/26/2006,What a Thrill Ride!,4,I have had my XLR-V for three months.  The only way to describe it is a Corvette with all the extras of a luxury Cadillac. 
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,Bob K, 10/09/2006,Much Better Than Expected,5,"Finally, a car that is as good or better than a Mercedes. The XLR-V is a gentleman's sports car.  It flies and handles great. At the club we get positive nods at the door, people are really impressed after a ride."
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,goglobal, 10/12/2006,XLR-V is awesome,5,This car is fantastic.  I would highly recommend it.  It provides a fantastic balance of performance and luxury.
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,2007 Cadillac XLR-V, 12/07/2006,Fast,4,I like fast cars and this one is just great. It is fast and very reliable. It rides really smoothly and you hardly hit any bumps.
cadillac,xlr-v,2007,John Cutsey, 04/26/2008,Awsome Machine,5,"As stated in my review above it has been the most exciting car that I have ever drove. I have had BMW's, Mercedes sl500 amg package, Jaquar XJR supercharged and nothing compares to not only the exciting drive, but all the looks you get from every age group 8 and 10 year olds through 75 to 85 year olds."
cadillac,xlr-v,2008,Richard Spratt, 10/18/2008,Fun beyond belief!!,4,"So far this car has been a dream to own. It is incredibly responsive and handles like a jag roadster but better. I have had it on two road trips and is an absolute joy to drive as well as  ride ride as a passenger. While it has a six speed ""automatic transmission"", my only regret is that I do wish it was a manual transmission.  My wife will take it out and put it through its paces and she would not want it to be a manual transmission.One other minor thing is that it does not have a factory installed connection to plug my I-Pod into the sound system. I would recommend this car to anyone!"
cadillac,xlr-v,2008,sp, 03/14/2008,"So far, so awesome",4,"I've driven a lot of different high end and sports cars, so when it came time to step it up to the 6-figure market, I had a lot to choose from. I chose the xlr-v for the styling, the acceleration, the hard top, the fact that all the options are included at base price (unlike the M6 or the SL550) and that it had a much more attractive and distinctive exterior body style than most cars in its class. I have driven this car almost every day (despite having 4 other cars at home to choose from), and I have yet to be disappointed.  This car is fast, comfy, technologically sophisticated, and it's a head-turner."
cadillac,xlr-v,2008,ANBEY, 04/21/2008,XLR-V,4,"I tend to drive a car hard.  This beauty can take it. The curves and laps disappear while admiring glances stand back and peer. I can't take this car out without some one having something glowing to say about it.  It is a real looker.  From LA to San Francisco the ride was smooth and easy. I arrived fresh as a daisy and ready to party at the wedding I was attending.  Waking up to a flat tire  bummed me out, until I realized it could drive 300 miles on the run-flats it came with. So I went to breakfast as planned . Later with the assistance of On-star  I casually sought out  a tire repair store. Goodyear did the trick, and I was on my way.  The joys and goodies are too many to name."
cadillac,xlr-v,2009,Scott Leyva, 05/12/2009,I love my XLR-V,4,"We traded our 1995 red XJS convertible after 14 years.  We knew nothing about the XLR, but were smitten once we drove it.  It gets just as many if not more looks and compliments!"
cadillac,xlr-v,2009,MJL, 12/06/2017,Claasic Cadillac Sports Car,5,"The car is pretty advanced for being 9 years old.  Nav and entertainment are just fine.  No USB.  It's the Corvette in a tuxedo!  It has 30,000 miles with no issues thus far.

mini,clubman,2017,John B in LIT, 12/24/2016,Happier with my MINI than I was with my BMW 328i,5,"The Clubman is about the same exterior and interior dimensions as the 3 series BMW. The S has a bit less BHP than the BMW 328, but this is almost unnoticeable and has plenty of power to spare, so don't be dissuaded by the side-by-side figures. The ALL4 provides superior traction in most conditions, which provides an additional level of confidence and safety on slick roads. Although both the BMW and the MINI have run flat tires as standard equipment, MINI offers a donut spare as an option and BMW does not. I would say that the handling of the Clubman is on an (excellent) par with the 3 series, and I actually prefer the MINI. The Clubman also has a panoramic sunroof as an option. The NAV/Entertainment architecture on the MINI is very similar to the BMW i-Drive, so transitioning from a BMW to a MINI is almost seamless. Interior comfort, in my 6' 1"" opinion, is actually superior in form, fit, and finish to the 3 series Bimmer, and the wagon design with folding rear seats of the Clubman is more practical than a sedan when you have stuff to load (BMW 3 series can be ordered as a wagon, but these are rare on BMW lots in the USA). MINI promotes and lends itself to some very nice individualizations (Stripes, wheels, etc.), so you can easily and economically modify the look of your MINI to make it uniquely ""your own,"" whereas with BMW, you more or less get what you buy/lease. Gas mileage could be better, but these cars inspire sporty driving, so my mileage may be as a result of my own lead foot and not the car. Warranties and maintenance plans are comparable between the MINI brand and the BMW (MINI is owned by BMW), and the MINI service department (at least where I live) is friendly, clean, well stocked, knowledgeable, and first rate with loaner cars available for customers. All this said, I think one of the things I like most about driving a MINI is that they aren't as ubiquitous and as cliche' as the BMW brand, and it's just a hoot to drive at about $8K+ less MSRP than a comparably equipped BMW. If you enjoy driving for the pleasure of driving and don't test drive a MINI Clubman S when considering premium compact cars, then you are shortchanging yourself.

mini,clubman,2017,Stewy33, 02/15/2019,Perfect all around every season car.,5,"35,000 miles later in the harsh winters of Wisconsin, The Mini Clubman S All4 is the perfect all around every season car. I average 33.5 MPG year round on 93 octane, with that confirmed on the pump. The green mode is great for cursing down the highway. The car has plenty of rear storage if you fold the back seats down. I was able to bring home a 55 inch TV with both barn doors shut no problem for reference. The 2.0L engine is okay... The Mini's engine is a down tuned BMW motor. (cough, cough) DINANtronics = +58HP/88TQ for the 2.0L S model installed for under $1,000. (20%+ HP gain) and trust me it is worth every penny!!! The 8 speed automatic transmission shifts so smoothly you barely know when it is shifting when you don't have your foot into it. Winter wise the All4 system (AWD) is outstanding. I tossed on a pair of Michelin iceX tires and drove to work in 2 blizzards this year. 5 inches of snow down...no problem. 6-10 inches in your way....the front splitter turns into a plow and starts stuffing the radiator opening, but she will keep going. (watch your temperature gauge!!!) My favorite feature of the car is the tire pressure monitors. My least favorite thing about the car is the front doors. They seem small and you can hit your head getting in. It is funny watching a passenger bonk their head getting in! (LOLOLOLOLOL)

mini,clubman,2017,Mark, 02/22/2017,New model=worse model,2,"The Clubman was redesigned for 2016.  If you look around the miniusa website you'll have a hard time finding anything relating to fuel efficiency while it was very proudly displayed among the info for the previous model.  It's a nice car, but one of the few perks it actually had was fuel efficiency. Now it's got a new engine(3 cylinder!) and the MPG is humorously bad. It gets 23 mpg in the city which is on par with some large sport utility vehicles but it's still a tiny car by comparison.  We've had three MINI's so I'm not a MINI basher. We previously had a Clubman that got 32 mpg on the same to work routes the new Clubman gets 23 mpg. What automaker does that?? In sum, you can get far more for far less money with lots of other vehicles.  The only benefits is that it looks different and you can find your car in a parking lot.  We have a ALL4 base model which is not listed among the choices here."
mini,clubman,2018,Chris B., 01/21/2018,Get the S,2,"Owned new clubman for 6 months after deciding between Mini Cooper S 4 door, Honda Civic, Audi A3, & Honda Accord.  We went with the Clubman for the handling, storage capacity in the back, ergonomic rear doors, and the allure of being part of owning a Mini.  Within the first 30 days started feeling buyers remorse due to incredible sluggish acceleration and even in ""sport"" mode the car lacks power (lack of horsepower almost felt dangerous in traffic and especially entering highways), which made us wishing we would've paid more for the S model.  We went back to the dealership to trade it in and they wanted 35% less than what we paid (we knew there would be depreciation), but the dealership elaborated that Mini halted production of the Clubman for several months because they were unsure if they should keep producing the car because customers were veering more towards Mini Coopers or Countryman models.  They also said that the value depreciated because of poor demand & potentially high cost of parts. We walked hoping that we would grow closer to the car. The car has an excellent cabin-feel, handles incredibly well, and the sunroof(s) are an amazing feature that make the cabin feel much bigger.  During a snowstorm the car slid off the road and the suspension got ripped apart... I firmly believe most cars would've survived the wreck, but the tiny parts got mangled from the impact. We purchased a Mini Cooper S for the handling and speed. The regular Clubman is just too boring and doesn't seem like a car that Mini wants to continue making.

mini,clubman,2018,Rick, 10/29/2020,Best small car I have ever owned!,5,"The 2018 Mini Cooper Clubman S is the best small car that I have every owned.   I was more then happy to trade in my 2017 Subaru Impreza Premium for my fully loaded Clubman S automatic in Dynamic Red Metallic.   From the first minute, the differences between these two could not be more stark.   I love the acceleraton of having the turbo 2.0 litre engine, combined with the 8 speed automatic.   I decieded to get a fully loaded car as I was tired to having such minimal amenties in my old Subaru.   I'm so glad that I did as I just enjoy the car so much and it's a real pleasure to drive too.   Years ago, I test drove a first generation Mini Cooper S and I thought the ride was too harsh much more towards sport.   My current car is much more friendly for a long drive.   I'm glad that I got the larger Mini as the extra space has come in handy for daily living, commuting, and shopping then smaller 3 door model.  I have found that the car is as refined as the 3 series BMW too.   I am happy to recommend the Mini Cooper Clubman S as a great all around vehicle and it's reliable too.

mini,clubman,2018,Jerry G, 08/20/2019,Great Little Go Kart,5,"Before you purchase a Mini Cooper, You need to know that underneath the quirky exterior of the new Mini's is a BMW! They are also not cheap cars. They are compact upscale small cars. They are extremely fun to drive, they are quick, and very nimble!

mini,clubman,2018,Greg Chick, 05/07/2020,Can drive 9 hrs. and feel great.,5,"The Mini Cooper Clubman, John Cooper works is a great car, cute, fast, I even get 32 MPG.  But a real big downfall is that the front tires went thin at 20,000 miles.  Heep in mind my driving got over 50,000 miles on my Honda CRV all wheel drive.  The dealer wanted $850 for a pair!.   So I went to Discount tire.
2,000 miles later, the brake light came on, I took it into a shop, the front brakes were gone.  Rotors and pads & switch etc. just under $1,000.  I didn't even ask the Mini dealer for a price.   The rears had another 10,000 mi left, so I am set to do fronts tomorrow.   As a note, I got over 50,000 miles on the CRV brakes AWD and they were still strong as per the Honda dealer when I traded it in for the Mini on new Years day, 2019,    
One other thing I realized about the dealer is when they did the $400 oil change, they did not rotate the tires.  The backs were 50% better.  Keep in mind, these are run flat tires, real expensive.

mini,clubman,2018,Koala Mama, 12/06/2020,"Fun, unique compact car",4,"We bought this used 4 months ago, we looked at Honda CRV, Mazda MX5, Kia Soul and  others, we love it.  It is sporty, nimble, quick, and I love it's unique style, We have a rare color combination of Digital Blue with a white roof/mirrors and Satellite Gray interior that really stands out from other vehicles in its class..  It is comfortable to drive and roomy without being too large.  Gas mileage is great.  We recently took it on a 1000+ mile trip and found the storage space to be adequate for our luggage.  The one thing that I really, really don't like is that they have manual seats.  Seriously?  You can't put an electric seat in a $40k+ car?  Heated steering wheel would be nice as well. It is difficult to see out the rear window due to the pillar from the two doors, a camera that projects into the rear view mirror, like Cadillac, would greatly improve visibility.

mini,clubman,2019,R K Carr, 03/26/2019,In the MINI Cooper Club man.,5,"Love this car. I’ve had many cars & SUVs in the past 34 years this is the most gratifying & most fun yet. Love everything about the car. Getting the black roof & tintingbthe windows gave the car a whole new dimension. Only two drawbacks with my Clubman; 1.  Unexpectedly the transmission disengage in the automated carwash and it will not go back into gear. 2. The turn signals on the rear doors are not brake lights. This has caused numerous drivers behind me consternation. Even had three pull up next to me to inquire about my malfunctioning brake lights and state that they almost ran into the back of me.

mini,clubman,2019,Keifer, 08/26/2019,Trends in Leased Vehicles,2,"I've been leasing cars for the last 15+ years and it seems as though the manufacturers are equipping cars with components that require replacement within the initial lease period.  I previously leased a Mercedes Benz GLK 350 and needed to replace tires after just 25K miles.  

My current lease is with a Mini Cooper Clubman S All-4 and it has 23K miles and needs front brakes rotors and wear sensors (estimated at $800+ at the dealer).  In addition, it seems as though i'll need tires shortly to make it to the end of my lease.

Quite possibly, i'm a sceptic, but it seems as thought the manufactures are equipping new vehicles with substandard performing parts and tires leaving the initial lease holder with significant financial responsibilities before the conclusion of the lease period.  One of the reasons I lease is to AVOID these types of expenses.  I've owned multiple vehicles over the years that were 4+ years old and had 40K+ miles before needing tires, and at no time did I require brakes.

Seems like a negative trend ... 

UPDATE: 3/2020
My disappointment remains regarding the maintenance required on a leased vehicle...I actually went back to Mini with the potential to buy another and now they offer a “Maintenance” line item you can purchase for $895 which covers brakes.  I guess they know the brake components won’t hold up for more than 26K miles.

mini,convertible,2017,Mike Sticksel, 09/11/2017,Great Little Pocket Rocket - Amazing Packaging,5,"OK to start this review out I admit that I had no intention of buying a MINI. Truth be told I went to look at a used Bentley Continental GT and the MINI Convertible was parked next to it. It attracted my wife like iron filing to a magnet! I drove the 10 year old Bentley with 50,000 miles on the clock and was VERY disappointed. Interior room was like a Camaro and it rode like a buckboard. True it was 10 years old, but it was a disappointment.  To keep my wife of 49 years happy we took the MINI Cooper S for a test drive. I was very skeptical about even taking it for a test drive but I figured ""what the heck!"". What a surprise. It rode great and the interior materials and fit and finish were top notch. The Caribbean Aqua color really looks cool, and the light gray leather interior and the rest of the interior surfaces exude ""Quality"". We had just leased a new Genesis G90 5.0 Ultimate AWD three months ago and I was very impressed with the quality and packaging of the MINI Convertible, even compared to our Genesis Luxo Barge. Plus it is a BLAST to drive. The 2.0 Liter Turbo 4 puts out more than enough thrust (189 hp & 207 Ft/lbs). We have been blessed with late Summer weather and we have been driving it with the top down exclusively. Every time I drive it I am amazed at the ride and room. It is truly ""10 pounds in a 5 pound bag"". The Genesis G90 is a serene drive - the MINI is FUN!. I might be a bit older than the demographic of the typical MINI Convertible owner (70 years young) but I still like to have fun. Seeing and then buying a 2017 MINI Cooper S with 8,000 miles on it was a happy accident. I would not have gone looking for it, but am very happy I found it.  We would never have the MINI as an only car - but as a second ""fun car"" it can't be beat.

Well I've had the car a year now and my opinion hasn't changed. We joined the local MINI Club and have been on many rallies and gone to quite a few car shows. It is a blast to drive ""hard"" and on rallies it corners like a go-kart. Puts a smile on my face every time I get in it. Only problem is that we have had one heck of a hot summer and the top-down time has been limited. Other than that, which is not the car's fault, it has been fun to own and drive. I would recommend one to anyone looking for a fun convertible. The Cooper S with 189 hp has more than enough punch.

mini,convertible,2017,Joe Tullos, 09/13/2017,Pricey But Fast,5,"Really cool car.  Super quick. The attention to detail inside and out is what makes this car worth the extra money compared to the Fiat 500 although the Fiat is a really cool car too.  The convertible top works great.  Loaded with ""features"" many of which I'll provably never use. The interior is roomier than it looks.  Well laid out instruments and cool mood lighting (one of the features I didn't need).  Our kids are grown, so the back seat is mainly for storage and the occasional friend who wants to go motoring. I drove it on vacation this year ... about 700 miles each way.  Handled like a champ.  So if you usually only have 2 passenger... want something sporty...and looks cool...this could be the car for you

mini,convertible,2017,AK, 01/13/2018,"Love my MINI, Warranty not meaningful",5,"I love my MINI convertible. I would prefer it got better gas mileage but I bought it knowing what the mileage would be. It had little issues within 4 months of buying it (last January). For example, on closing the top, I got conflicting messages. On one instrument it said ""retraction complete."" On another instrument (large one where radio , manual etc are) where I never got messages, it said retraction NOT complete.  So, there appeared to be a computer glitch.  When I called the dealer, Seattle MINI by my house, they said if I brought it in, that was my ONE annual visit covered by my warranty.  So, I did not take it in and the issue eventually went away.  But, I only drove 6K miles during this last year, so I assume I still have a computer glitch which I will have them check out when I take it in this month.   You should not get the Bicycle Rack prep unless you verify what bicycle rack is available. For my MINI Cooper convertible, the only bike rack available is sold by MINI for $749.00.  So, with the Rack Preparation, that is $1,000.00 to be able to carry a bike. Unless you are an avid cyclist, probably not a good investment. Its a great car, though. I love it.

mini,convertible,2017,JCW Driver, 07/07/2017,JCW,5,"Love , love this car.  I bought a JCW and it's clearly a car  for people who love to drive. My previous car was an Audi TDI that was bought back by Audi as part of the diesel gate. I looked into a new GTI but they're made in Mexico, not buying a German car made in Mexico.  I contemplated buying another Audi but wanted to try something completely different this time. There is nothing practical about this car. It's really just a two seater with an average size trunk. Other two seaters are just too small for my height (over6').  It gets good mpg but the tank is too small. The most disappointing thing about the purchase was the buying process.  There is only one MINI dearer in my city and it's either pay their price or don't and  they only had one JCW conv. . I was able to negotiate a little off their price but according to Edmunds  I still paid too much.  I have had the car for three months and have had no problems. Although I am really enjoying this car and have no serious complaints  right now I'm sorry to say but it will probably be my only MINI purchase. Next time I go back to another German car."
mini,convertible,2017,Jon, 11/06/2018,Absolute blast to drive,5,"Small sports car with big attitude.. jump in hammer down the throttle and the turbo pushes you back in to the seat.

mini,convertible,2018,Mario Sanders, 07/04/2018,My other Mini,5,"This is my second Mini convertible. I bought a 2018 Mini convertible Aqua blue. It has great performance and the color stands out. We have a 2017 Mini Clubman also as it performs great as well. My Mini Convertible top can open halfway like a sunroof. Most convertible vehicles don't open like this. This is a great size for a little car and can fit into small spaces very well. With back up camera and warning signals helps a lot into small spaces. My 2005 Mini Convertible did not have such features. It handles very well with the top open and even when top is down we just love to ride in the country. It is very good on gas mileage. It is hard to decide which mini to drive the next day. The Clubman or the Convertible. Both handles very well.

mini,countryman,2017,Cameron, 08/15/2017,New and Improved,5,"I was seeking a downsize from a midsize SUV when I stumbled upon the new Countryman. Mini has done an incredible job at making the cabin feel spacious and functional despite it being much smaller than what I was accustomed. If you are at all familiar with BMW products (X1 in particular) you will notice some striking similarities from the cabin materials to infotainment. Performance is good and it is a blast to drive - however, you can expect ride quality to match the sporty driving characteristics. The cabin certainly gets a shock over potholes - the dynamic damper control is a must if you want an improved ride. I was skeptical of Mini's reliability (which influenced my decision to lease); if you do your research you will see that the new engine and chassis are straight off the BMW X1 and have displayed exceptional reliability so far. Overall, I am highly impressed with new Countryman, a car that was certainly NOT on my radar when I started shopping. If you are looking for a car that is engaging to drive while offering compact SUV capacity and capabilities this is a safe bet.

mini,countryman,2017,Bruce Bolen, 08/22/2017,"Unique, classy, practical and fun",5,"It's an emotional car and a blast to drive.  I knew when I ordered a Mini, it would likely have problems based on Mini's track record.  The sales experience was dysmal; the dealer is 171 miles from my front door.  I asked the salesman to pick us up at the airport nearest the dealer, 20 minutes away.  He refused.  We got lost on the city trolley system and asked the dealer receptionist to have someone pick us up, which they finally did.  The salesman had all the paperwork wrong (after I'd given specific email information), and, after the third try and 1.5 hours we were on our way.  At the first rest stop, my wife opened the passenger door and a trim piece fell in her lap.  The second day, the infotainment system had long delays, there was static in the speakers and the navi froze.  Later, the heads-up display developed a loud clicking noise while retracting, and the rear hatch would come open by itself when nobody was around the car.  Mini USA was more than accommodating by providing a flatbed four two 342-mile round trips from my home to the dealer, one to diagnose the infotainment problem, and a second to make the repairs (after waiting nine weeks to get a new head unit).  The service writer at the dealership who handled everything over this two-month period was also exceptional.  I wanted a Mini Countryman really, really badly, so I have never waivered from loving the car right from the start.  After owning over 35 new cars and reading every review known to man, I knew I wanted and loved the new Countryman.  The car is economical, power is adequate, the paddle shifters are very intuitive to use, and the outstanding 8-speed auto is always in the gear you want.  The steering is exceptional, the brakes very solid, and the sport seats are very comfortable.  The standard sunroof in this car has less draft and minimal buffeting....better tan I've experienced in Mercs and BMW's.  The suspension is very well sorted out, providing an outstanding ride/handling compromise. Overall MP g is 31 in mixed driving and 34 highway on  mid-grade fuel. In spite of my horrific sales experience and all the electronic issues, I still highly recommend this delightful and wonderful car which is now 100% operational with 5,400 miles

mini,countryman,2017,Joseph Yeow, 04/22/2019,"Looks great, fun to drive and high maintenance",3,"Fun comes with a price. In this case, high maintenance. I bought one with 19’ wheels and all the bells and whistles that include self park, nav, heads up display and upgraded audio. Not sure why but manufacture equipped the car with Summer high performance tires that left me with 2mm thread during 8k oil change. E-mailed Mini and they referred me back to dealer which provides no answer but saying that run flats don’t comes with mileage warranty. Other than that, the electrical unit on the instrument cluster keeps having issues where all lights would come on during drive. After resetting it for 3 times at a dealership, I gave up and let it be. Same with the foot kicking trunk lid where it’ll pop open when I get close to the car before kicking it. Problem solved after 2 visit. This is a great looking car with the drive of a bmw. However, time and money comes with that as a package so think twice before owning it. Did I mentioned replacing wearable parts like windshield wiper now requires buying the extra package?

mini,countryman,2017,Steve, 07/09/2020,Nice car with an expensive design flaw,3,"I have owned two Mini Countryman, a 2015 and now currently a 2017 Countryman S ALL4.  The car itself is nice, and after 3 years I am happy overall with the vehicle except for one flaw which I consider to be major if you don't like pouring money down the drain.

I am not happy at all with what appears to be either an intentionally built in design flaw, or a complete lack of engineering and incompetent  design.  The issue: If you spill any liquid on the center console where the cup holders are located, you have the potential to trigger a transmission warning that cannot be extinguished, and will cost you thousands to repair.

My daughter had her drink spill on the center console, a full fountain drink that dripped out the top and onto the console as she rounded a corner.  This occurred several weeks ago and has had time to dry completely.  I now have a transmission service light on that cannot be extinguished.  I took the car to the dealer, and this is the story.

Liquid, spilled on the console, near the cup holders, will seep into the gear shifter mechanism located directly below the cup holders. When this mechanism and it's circuitry get wet, it triggers a transmission warning light that cannot be extinguished, even after the mechanism has been dried.

The service department indicated that there is no mechanical issue with the transmission, and that the electronics in the mechanism are functioning normally and there is no short.  Despite this, there is no way to eliminate the transmission service light.  What has been explained, is that a moisture detector, once triggered, will show this fault until the unit is replaced, even if there is no mechanical or electrical reason for this fault light to remain on.  

The price to replace this unit (which is not mechanically or electrically compromised)?  $1500.00

Some questions I asked;

What is the reason to design a console that has a cup holder where any spillage from the cup holder potentially can cost $1500 to repair?  No answer.  

What assures me that another spill after the unit is replaced will not repeat the same issue costing another $1500?  No answer.

Why is there not a waterproofing cover or plastic sheeting that deflects moisture away from the shifter mechanism if it is located directly under a cup-holder?  No answer.

Now my choice is, pay $1500 to repair a part that is not malfunctioning only because it encountered a spill, and HOPE that it doesn't happen again, or leave the light on and HOPE a real transmission issue doesn't arise that will be masked by the fact that the light remains illuminated.

This, in my opinion, is a very poorly designed car, if a simple issue like this can cost such a large amount to repair.  Did none of the engineers at Mini, consider this, and simply cover the component with a moisture deflection barrier?  Or is this designed into the car so that Mini may charge money to replace a part that is actually working.  $1500?

Very poor design.  I invite Mini to dispute this or provide any explanation as to why they would not protect circuitry under a CUP HOLDER from possible spillage.  If I have a $1500 electronic component, I would never set my drink on top of it.  Neither would I expect the manufacturer of that $1500 component to suggest I place drinks on top of it, Why? because everyone knows spills can happen,it would be foolish to set my drink on a Stereo, no matter the cost.  But that is exactly what Mini has done. Placed a $1500 component in the center console and then a cup holder directly above it,  with no protection for the component at all.

My recommendation, don't buy this car, or, if you do, don't allow any beverage in the car unless it's a sealed bottle, and then be very careful not to spill it.

mini,countryman,2017,Lou, 02/01/2018,2017 Mini Countryman WORST CAR,1,"I have had my 2017 Mini Countryman for 11 months and 3 of those months it has been in the shop.  The electronic parking brake fails.  Mini does not take responsibility for this extremely dangerous glitch and says that according to the manual I need to use chock blocks to ""safely"" park my vehicle. This petroleum jelly substance oozes out from under the hood and stains all that it touches.  Mini will not fix this (they say it is common in Minis and BMWs) and says it will happen for 20,000 miles (this is a BRAND NEW CAR).  The car will lock the keys in the car.  I have had friends witness this flabbergasted that the car decided to lock itself in front of us.   The Bluetooth will play music over phone calls.  There is no where to turn the music off since it was never on in the first place.  The only way to remedy the situation is for me to hang up and call the person back.  In general the electronic interface is very glitch and delayed.  I am 5'2"" tall.  The car does not fit me.  The visors are too short, the center controls are too far back.  I could go on and on, the car has been a nightmare!   I bought this car because I loved my 2014 Mini Countryman.  The 2017 is a terrible redesign and is glitch filled.  I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER MINI!

mini,countryman,2017,Joyce, 08/23/2017,MINI company does not support vehicle,1,"I liked my new 2017 countryman when I first got it but after trying to get service for it... I WOULD NEVER BUY A MINI AGAIN!  The service people at Global Imports MINI in Atlanta have had my car at the shop for almost 11 weeks.  They keep claiming that they cannot get the part shipped from Europe.  After 9 weeks the part finally shipped from MINI but when it arrive the part was missing a part!  Now it has been 2 weeks and that part has still not arrived.  The MINI company has been terrible with customer service with complete lack of followup and a complete inability to be able to track a part being shipped.  This is the most disorganized company I have ever seen with the worst customer service.  I could have ordered a whole new car in the time it is taking them to provide one part.

mini,countryman,2018,Erich Meyer, 01/20/2019,Still smiling after 18 months,4,"Leased a 2018 Countryman ALL 4 Cooper S for my wife who had drove an Explorer for years.  She was tired of the same boring SUV style everyone else has so we got the Mini. Test drove many of them and the S model with the 2.0 liter inline four is the way to go.  Has a firm ride if you're not used to it but still a blast to drive after 18 months and 14,000 miles and everyone loves the looks of it.  Think the run flat tires make the ride firmer than it needs to be.  Hugs corners and just makes you want to drive fast.  Very quick although I think the two door Cooper S models are a bit faster. It has an amazing amount of room inside for the kids in the back seat.  The high pressure fuel pump was replaced at 6,000 miles but the dealer in Highlands Ranch, CO was great to work with since under warranty.  My wife doesn't care about cars typically but she loves this one. I'm nervous about the potential reliability issues down the road so that's why we leased it.  Would like to keep it so will see how it does the next 18 months.

mini,countryman,2018,Allyson Smith Harris, 03/23/2019,Very pleased,4,"The biggest plus is the fuel economy.  I’ve had the car two weeks and haven’t had to fill up just yet. The acceleration is a plus as well. It’s roomier than one might expect. I had a vendor event and was able to fit all of my items in the back with room to spare. I’ve carpooled with my husband who is a big guy and he falls asleep with no problem lol The controls take a bit to get accustomed to. They are cumbersome and some of the options seem unnecessary (Granted my prior vehicle had an iPad as the console). The sound system is pretty good. The Multimedia configurations leave a little to be desired. The quality of conversations can be a bit compromised on occasion. Overall, I’m very happy with the car. I think that if I hadn’t had the amenities in my prior vehicle (Volvo xc90-2016) I would still find fault with the technology.
"
mini,countryman,2018,Eric Scholz, 08/22/2018,First time Mini owner,5,"Car performs better than spec - averaging 80 MPG (due to short commute, however).  Drive is quiet, trans is smooth, acceleration is excellent.  Love the Mini interior - has much more style than other comps.  Materials are great.  No rattles or squeaks so far.  Roof rails/fold down seats come in handy.  Plug in with 120v is fine for overnight.  Havent needed 240v.  Electric range is adequate, but would be nice to have 20-25 mile range.  Beyond that on a hybrid seems like a waste of money/weight/resources (should be big enough for a round trip commute, road trips will use gas regardless).  Only minor complaint: brakes are a little touchy at slow speed stops - could use a little more give - but can get used to it by feathering the pedal.  Overall - 4.5 Star!  Love this car...
"
mini,countryman,2018,Paul, 10/13/2018,A surprisingly fun car to drive,4,"Although I had a couple of hiccups in buying the car, the vehicle itself is proving to be a delight to drive. Its the fully loaded automatic 4ALL version. It’s been incredibly stable and sure-footed during torrential downpours and the bad weather we’ve been having. There are only two bits I would consider changing. A more comfortable seat (it’s not the worst seat but the VW Golf I drove before this was pretty comfortable straight out. This requires more work.) and slightly less tire noise. Quality of materials is high. I only wish a better hybrid was more widely available.
"
mini,countryman,2018,Adam, 06/23/2019,Third MINI. LOVE it despite some consistent flaws,4,"This car is a huge upgrade in drivability over my 2015 and 2013 models.  The ergonomics and quality of the controls inside is much upgraded as is the ride quality, noise, vibration, harshness, and overall livability.  My main gripe is with the quality of the leatherette upholstery in these vehicles.  This is my THIRD MINI where the leatherette on the driver's seat has broken down and cracked.  Both other MINI's had the driver's seat cover replaced under warranty and I am expecting the same on my 2018 considering the fact that this is supposed to be a premium make and the car is less than a year old.  There's clearly an issue with this upholstery that BMW/MINI hasn't quite figured out.

"
mini,countryman,2019,David Odoms, 10/14/2018,Lot to like,4,"The car has get up and go using the electric and gas, which is engaged whenever you stop and restart the car; it is the default setting. There are many things that I like about this vehicle and a few that could be improved. Being a BMW Owner since 89, this is one of the only vehicles that got me to switch; I wanted a vehicle that I could take off the beaten path a little. BMW X  heckle don’t really look the part for off the beaten path type of vehicle and since BMW owns the brand I test drove it. I drove the S, which was very nice, drove the JCW did not like because engine noise was loud during acceleration and was rather stiff handling and over bumps, SE was extremely quiet did not know it was running. The SE performed the best overall in my opinion, but the S is a good trade off. I got the SE because the dealer was knocking off $3k and the government discount for hybrids made priced close to the S. 

I love the enter/exit height of the vehicle, i.e., no plopping down or having to climb up into it. I love that it came with all of the bells and whistles standard in the limited edition. However, I do not know why they included features to prevent you from hitting a vehicle or pedestrian in front of you but left out blind spot warnings. The interior is excellent and the seats are quite comfy in cloth. Not sure why they put in manual seats instead of power when you have all of the bells and whistles. That is not a big deal as once it is set, I rarely change the seat position except for when wearing winter gear. The rear lift gate opens all of the time without issue using a light kick and then backing up. Gas mileage depends on how you drive. I am still learning, but have managed to get into a rhythm if you will. The trick to getting excellent gas mileage is to use the green mode. However, performance is definitely hampered, but when you are on a road by yourself or heavy traffic, it is great to save during these times. When driving in green mode on the back roads or heavy traffic, I select save the battery, which recharges the battery quite well. I love the cornering lights, because they light up the way when you turn. I love car play and the HK sound system. "
mini,countryman,2019,Eric S, 11/28/2018,2000 mile review,4,"So far, love this car.  Quiet, sporty ride, great acceleration, awesome materials, comfortable seats.  My commute suits this car with 12 miles round trip.  Only complaints are grabby brakes (but you do get used to it) and could use a little more range on battery.  Transition of battery to engine is seamless, you can hardly tell other than a boost in power.  If you drive long distances, might as well get the non-hybrid model.  Plug in is fine, like the pre-condition option.  AWD is computer controlled, so slightly different than what I am used to, but so far, so good on my steep snow covered driveway.  Backseat is comfortable.  The selection for vents could use improvement-cycling through options is annoying.  But, typically, it is set it and forget it.  No problems with rear hatch and use the foot activation all the time.  Sound system great.  Since my commute is mostly short, my overall MPG since I bought the car (with some long road trips) is over 80 mpg - awesome.  So far, plan to buy this car out at end of lease.
"
mini,countryman,2019,Rebecca R., 09/11/2018,"Run away, run fast, don't look back!",1,"Why would someone (me) plunk down tens of thousands with zero research on a mini hybrid? I'll tell you why. Having owned a mini before, and having had a wonderful experience with both the product and the dealer, we didn't think twice about checking out the 2019 hybrid. When I walked into the showroom and saw the hybrid with a big 60+ on the sticker, I got googly-eyed like a girl seeing Sting for the first time. Clearly I didn't have enough knowledge to understand that the 60+ sticker on the window meant something very different from the sticker I had seen on other hybrids. Have you ever impulse bought an expensive item only to get it home and realized by your spouse's expression that you have made a really bad purchase? I have. Buyer beware of the Hybrid Mini. I look forward to having it out of my garage and out of my life. 

That won't happen for a while though. After putting 800 miles on it and realizing the reality about the lack of economy of my new Mini/BMW product, the dealer offered to buy it back for $10K less than I paid for it and with 800 miles on the odometer. As much as I wish I could take a 10K loss, I couldn't.  I could have rented a Porsche 911, maybe two, for that much.

This car gets ~30 mpg and I commute 74 miles each way to work. It does not have the range of 60+ as implied prominently on the sticker. It uses Half of a tank of gas, round-trip in the Eco Green mode. It has to be plugged in when not in use. Every single time it is not in use. it has a wimpy 9 gallon tank.  On the highway, it's a dog. 

I understand now that the 60+ on the sticker has no relationship to actual fuel economy. Rather it's one component of a math formula required to estimate economy based on an individual's driving. So if you're happy to go from 0-60 in a few minutes, from the metering light, if you're all about appearance no matter how impractical, if you're a soccer parent whose kid isn't on a travel team, if your grocery store is walking distance, if you drive without the wheels touching the ground at a sedate speed, this is the car for you. It's cute and gives the illusion of fuel economy.  

Drove the kid to school. ~3 miles round trip, in ""Eco Green"" mode. Avg speed 21. MPG: 34.4. I commute in this car only to advertise my displeasure. Give a little honk if you see me. Mine is the one with prominent ""Buyer Beware"" signs all over it. 

Please don't insult me for not having done my homework, I feel stupid enough as it is. Please don't make unrealistic recommendations I can't implement. 

The salesman was a good guy, the dealership is nice, the car is cute. But, what I was looking to buy was a vehicle with good gas mileage like my cheapo last hybrid. Didn't like that car but at least the gas mileage was good. And I hoped for a car that offered a nicer driving experience.

Things I didn't notice during the test drive. The toggles are cute but are rendered non-functional if a drink e.g. water bottle, is placed in the cupholder -- blocks the toggles. The power windows squeal when putting the windows down. The automatic lift gate works to raise occasional and only after my shin is covered in grease from attempting to open. It doesn't work for closing the liftgate at all. The dash is a strange material that draws and holds dust. The cargo capacity is small when the back seats are up. The owners manual is dumber than I am for buying this car. Look up what a color on the dash means. The manual will enlighten you by telling you it's a color. Haven't yet determined how to use the online manual. For optimizing mileage, multiple steps are required to program for efficiency. While driving, I don't want to toggle a bunch of things to gain efficiency. One button or in this case, toggle, should suffice. The controls on the round knob are not intuitive. Someone must have noticed that because there are redundant buttons to bypass the knob and
 shortcut to functions e.g. turning on the radio. Not sure why they couldn't just design it to turn on by pushing the on/off button. That button works for turning the radio off, but the shortcut button is used to turn it on.

Mini offered to send someone out to teach me how to drive it. In this case 40 years of driving experience didn't cut it. So far, I've heard nothing further about this Unicorn Engineer who is going to teach me that driving 3 miles with an average speed of 21 mph is not the way to get good economy. 

If you're buying this car, plan to spend a few hours at the dealer for a class on functionality after your purchase. If you want a nice driving experience, combined with economy, for a sticker price less than a mortgage payment, I'm not sure where, but look elsewhere.

There is more cargo room than one would expect for a small SUV.

mini,countryman,2019,Peter Philpot, 07/15/2019,Disappointing,3,"Don't Buy. Originally our salesman, Ryan George in Palm Harbor, Florida mentioned the mileage would be about 65 miles per gallon and that was also in the advertising.  This was appealing to us as I do a lot of driving in my business.  So we traded the Countryman we had just purchased for the hybrid.  The mileage is much less than expected or advertised.  So far, in less than 1,000 miles, 38.7 mpg.  Even fully charged, the battery gets less than 15 miles before switching over to the engine.  Very disappointing.  We are going on facebook to see how many other people are having these results and if we come up with 100 or more, we may bring a class action suit against Mini Cooper/BMW for false advertising.  I am a little embarrassed too, as I told a lot of clients and friends that I was going to do this because of the mileage as well as the overall appearance and performance of the Countryman, so with such a disappointing performance, I really can't justify the investment.

The car only had the 1.5 engine, but I found no problem with the car’s acceleration getting up to speed on the freeways in Southern California traffic. I was surprised to find that the car sat much higher than expected.  I assumed I would be hauling myself up and out of the car, but I was wrong.

mini,countryman,2019,Paul Weise, 04/30/2019,Worst car I’ve ever driven,1,"I got this car as a rental while my car was getting repaired after a collision, first thing I noticed was the terrible stiff suspension as I left the rental lot, then I tried to accelerate onto the freeway and it eventually got up to  speed with great effort. The radio/ infotainment system is a pain to navigate so much so that it has a warning every time you start the car, not to scroll through it while driving. All the options are controlled by a scroll wheel on the console, I had to delete the pandora and Spotify apps off my phone so that the car would stop trying to use them instead of just playing music off iTunes.

The seats are not particularly comfortable and the leg room is cramped in the front seats. This car is not good for city driving or sitting in traffic, at freeway speeds it rides ok with cruise control on but don’t try to overtake anybody in a reasonable amount of time.

Now for the first world problems 

Equipped with push button start but not keyless entry so you still need to pull out your keys every time you get in or out of it

The Bluetooth cuts out sometimes if you get a notification on your phone, and takes 5-10 seconds to reconnect when you get in.

The air conditioning is LOUD, I’ve been driving in temps around 70F and the radio has to be at about 80% to here it over the fans on medium speed. If the AC is on full blast the volume has to be at max to kinda hear it. 

The only thing louder than the AC is the turn signal click

The car has no navigation or apple carplay or android auto support 

Avoid renting this car. DON’T BUY IT there are plenty better cars for cheaper

Acceleration is poor as the automatic gearbox struggle to work out which gear it should be in. In turn, this means there is significant turbo lag. On motorways this performance issue is obvious, especially when changing lanes. In city traffic, good luck accelerating out of a corner. Also gone in the 2019 model is the hidden dash storage above the glove box and the netting storage pouces on the sides of the footwells.  I opted not to get the premium sound upgrade - a choice I regret. The audio quality is like that on a Versa or Rio with less speakers.  A very sad Mini.

What a joy this little pup is! Like a Wrangler, there is a give-and-take feel...a love/hate relationship that adds up to a love affair unlike most other cars I've owned. It's why I enjoyed my Jeeps and why I so much enjoy my Mini. If these cost $80k you would say...so now I see why. They are quality well beyond the price tag and driving one is a sheer joy. Keep wanting to get in and go somewhere I don't need to go.

Not only does it handle exceptionally well in all weather conditions, it gets great mileage and has been very reliable. I replaced the run-flat tires with some wider softer tread tires, and that really made the car ride much more smoothly. I just carry a can of flat fixer in case I ever get a flat, which I have not in all the years I've owned it. I always tell people that the mini is not a luxury car, it drives like a sports car.

It's fast (although could be faster), and the phrase ""corners like it's on rails"" is a tremendous understatement.  Unfortunately, the fun can only be had for 4, maybe 5 days a week, as the Cooper will inevitably spend the rest of the week getting fixed.  In the 2+ years that I've had my car, it has been in the shop for a total of about 14-16 times.  Everything has been replaced (from the power steering fan, to the entire transmission, and everything in between). I would estimate that the total cost of repairs (under warranty) has been approximately $10-$12K CDN."
mini,cooper,2002,Fun in Del Mar, 04/03/2008,Clutch and Transmission Failure,3,"I have had a lot of trouble initially with the computer system of the car, but the worst is that I had to have the clutch replaced at 75,000. miles and now I need a new transmission at 83,000. miles.  Dealer tells me it's my driving - but I have been driving Beemer stick-shifts my whole life - I never had to have either one of those parts replaced until I got to 175,000. miles.  Furthermore, all maintenance the car needs is very expensive - which may have to do with individual dealerships. Nor am I happy about the acceleration of the car.  It certainly does not compare to any of the 3- series of the BMW's - but then again it's also cheaper."

mini,cooper,2002,ghost, 09/30/2008,Very upset!!,2,"I purchased my 2002 Mini last Aug. 2007.  I have driven it less than 3 thousand miles..if even that much.  I was told today that something called the Final Drive needed to be replaced and the Transmission was messed up.  Being that our economy is so great and I can't get a job- I couldn't afford the thousands it cost to fix it.. and lost over thousands in letting it go for pennies.  I am saddened beyond belief that a car that I thought was so incredible, after all, a BMW etc., turned out to be the biggest lemon that I have ever purchased. OK.. I loved that car for the whole time I had it.. and now.. feel so very let down!"
mini,cooper,2002,Drew, 06/07/2007,Best Car. . .Ever,5,"The MINI Cooper S is, without a doubt, one of the greatest autos ever delivered to the masses. It combines just about every ideal for a car, from safety to sporty, economy to performance, capacity to compactness (read ""park it anywhere"").  I've had mine for a year and have literally nothing but praise for it, and can't wait to drive it every time I've got to go somewhere. Now I'm just wondering when the honeymoon will end."
mini,cooper,2002,Tollag, 04/06/2002,Perfection?,5,"When I first sat in the Mini Cooper, in 
the mid 70's, I was blown away at the 
abundance of space! When I first heard 
it was being re-designed, and 
introduced into the U.S., I had to 
order it! After waiting 3 months, to 
that final test drive, I nearly had a 
heart attack. The low end power was 
incredible! Then, when I got behind the 
wheel of the ""Big Dog"" the Mini Cooper 
S, I knew it was for me. Everything 
fromt he ample space to the incledible 
German Engineering made me fall in love 
all over again, and all for a moderate 
price! It truly is an amazing car! I 
wish the ""Fun to drive"" column didn't 
end at 10!"
mini,cooper,2002,Mr. Mini, 04/14/2002,The Best Car In The World!!!! Hands Down,5,"The Funnest and Bestest car i have 
ever droven. That exterior is unique

house. I wouldn't trade it for 
anything in the world."
mini,cooper,2002,jennyj, 06/07/2010,Stay Away!,2,"I bought this car from the previous owner who babied the car and had virtually no mileage. I argued with my family and friends that if I had to drive a ""fuel economy"" car it would at least not be generic, so I bought the Mini. To say I have been let down with this car and BMW's backing of this car would be the understatement of the millennium! The transmission went at 42,000 miles and the wanted 7,500 to replace it, even though there were hundreds of similar complaints of faulty tranny's, BMW simply turned its head! Next were the window motors, the end caps of the rain gutters, the exhaust (at over a grand), the power steering pump, and more! This car is the biggest pile of garbage around!"
mini,cooper,2002,T Ritchison, 02/08/2008,Mighty,4,"My Mini S, makes me smile. It's everything I ever wanted in a small car. Lots of fun to drive. The 6 speed is awesome. The engine is very reponsive. I've taken many long trips. The hum of the engine & exhaust at 60- 80 MPH, is music. Never had so much fun. I'm a backpacker. The room in the back is perfect for wine, hiking poles, cooler, 1 large suitcase and 2 back packs. My only dislike; the run flat tires. Expensive to replace  and are good for about 25-27 G's. But I can live with that! I believe, its the best reproduction ever. My Mini & Me. My license plate is MIGHTY. Its that and then some. Wow!"

and a ride that is much quieter than 
you would think for such a small car.

the fun of driving!"

cart-like handling and roomy interior. 
(For two passangers) While the front 
seats are very comfortable, there is 
little leg room for additional 
passangers. Gadgets! This car is so 
cool. Heated seats, headlamp washer 
jets, on-board computer, retro interior 
styling just to name a few. Don't 
purchase this car if you dislike 
attention. People love the way this 
thing looks. The 17"" rims and low 
profile run-flat Pirelli tires with the 
wide stance gives it a bulldog 
appearance. The ""S"" model looks 
aggressive with the hood scoop to feed 
the super charger."

It is BMW technology at its best - an affordable, compact car that people from all walks of life desire.  The history plays a major roll for this car, yet even if this was its first time around, I believe it would be equally as popular simply because of its perfect engineering and carefree lifestyle that it promotes.  Whenever MINI owners pass one anther on the street they most always wave or honk, very unusual in today's world of ""iPods."""
mini,cooper,2002,urbanllc, 09/06/2005,love it / hate it,3,"I can't think of another car I could want after having a MINI; however, especially for the first two years, I can't think of another car that could have given me so much trouble.  I'll chalk it up to having bought the first model year. The mpg is poor and not nearly as high as represented.  Still, it's a good city car, fun to drive and easy to park. Service at my dealer is superb.   Surprisingly, with the backseats down, it can transport quite a lot of cargo. "
mini,cooper,2002,BERANDY, 04/15/2003,What a car!!,5,"When I first saw this car I knew it 
was for me.  I'm a total car freak and 
have spent my life constantly trying 
to find out all there is to know about 
all the cars on the road.  
Finally here was a car with  such 
character!!  Just seeing all the 
little chrome details on the exterior 
was enough for me.  Until this car 
came along I was afraid I was doomed 
to a life of all-one-color cars!  
Thank you BMW!"
mini,cooper,2002,cheryl,,"""uncle""",3," This car is so much fun to drive, rivaling other imports I've had. It has plenty of power to render confidence in passing and on ramp approach, corners on a dime, and has awesome gas milage without performance trade-off.  However, I've experienced way too many costly repairs ie. engine wire harness, intake valve module, cooling fan module, power steering pump etc. It's time to cut my losses. Regretable, I scream uncle.  "
mini,cooper,2002,Lynn, 07/31/2018,TOP GEAR,4,"I got my mini one year ago (2017) as a ""TOY"".  Just for fun, running errands, drive it locally. etc. Keep in mind, the mini was 15yrs old when I got it. The odometer  showed 55,000 but after getting a car-fax, the mini really had 160,000 last time reported in 2015. Now in 2018 I estimate the mini to have close to 200,000.  My mini is still strong, tranny is smooth, changes gears easy, clutch is perfect. I never would have guess the actual mileage to be so high.  It drives so good, I don't use my SUV much any more. I don't know how long it will run without repairs, but for me it's ""TOP GEAR""

adjusted to fit anyone. A friend of 
mine who is 6'5"" even found a 
comfortable seating position with 
plenty of headroom. The performance 
and handling is super. I find myself 
searching out the longest, twistiest

park. Highly recommended."

mini,cooper,2002,Barb Wilcox, 07/12/2016,A very nice SECOND car.,4,"Number one would be the extraordinarily high dealer maintenance costs!  They are about the same across the board as a very high level BMW.  Great handling, but with the basic set-up, very poor acceleration.  Very easy to park.

is disaster.  BigJames does not need 
this mess.  The car looks stupid just a

BigJames's only good thing to say is 
that he should be able to unload it

so hot right now."

safe.  I feel like I am driving a cheap 
Korean car in this MINI.  Hey, at least 
I can sell it to some other

a year.  My favorite remains Porsche, 
however, I tried a MINI for a month to 
see what it would do.  What a 
disappointment.  The standard MINI 
shifter was terrible.  So, I got the S 
which was only marginally better.  Poor 
acceleration for what they claim to be 
a fun to drive car.  Much like a Honda 
Civic more than anything else.  Moving 
on."
mini,cooper,2002,wannam3, 07/16/2002,Only a bucket of headaches,1,"Having owned three other BMWs in the 
past, I eagerly bought one of the first 
MINIs in the Bay area.  Although 
Beemers tend to be a little fussy, my 
MINI was a disaster.  Rattles 
everywhere, poor low end torque, 
windshield wiper did not work well, 
leaky fuel line, and two engine cutoffs 
on the highway.  The second was the 
last straw.  Luckily, I had bought a 
couple other BMWs in the past, and they 
wanted to make me happy, so they 
refunded all of my money except $500.  
Bye bye MINI, maybe in a couple years 
the defects will be worked out."

It is a great car to drive and it feels 
like a sports car!  

The car is best suited to drivers using 
the back seat for occasional 
passengers.  If you will be seating 
more than two people on a regular basis 
you might be well to size it up for all 
concerned before purchase."
mini,cooper,2002,Ro, 04/28/2002,Mini Fun,4,"Excellent performance for the small

Definitely fun to drive and at present

car I have ever owned."
mini,cooper,2002,Madeline, 05/03/2002,What was I thinking?,2,"I should have just bought a BMW instead 
of compromising with a Mini.  I think I 
was deceived into thinking the Mini was 
simple a small version of a BMW 3 
series.  It is not.  Do not get fooled 
as the novelty wears off quicker than 
any other car I have owned."
mini,cooper,2002,timemoves, 05/04/2002,What a major disappointment!,1,"I feel that with all the positive 
reviews here, the MINI would be a great 
choice.  A test drive revealed a few 
flawas, but I just thought I was being 
a little too picky.  Well, three weeks 
with the car and it remains my biggest 
car purchase mistake ever.  There is 
really nothing fun about this car.  If 
you want excitement with this little 
amount of sheet metal, you might as 
well buy a motorcycle instead.  That is 
basically what the car is like.  It is 
something of a hybrid between a riding 
lawn mower and a motorcycle.  Nice 
concept, but a very poor execution.  
Shame on BMW for putting this thing on 
the US market."
mini,cooper,2002,blairp, 05/04/2002,A thoroughly major disappointment,1,"I should have not been fooled by the 
marketing hype.  I am 6 foot and about 
190 lbs.  There is no easy way to be in 
the MINI.  I guess if you are a short 
European or scrawny American is the 
only way it will make sense.  A real 
man could never fit into this thing.  
The dealer kept telling me I would grow 
to love it.  I should have passed.  Now 
I have a Mini that sits in my garage 
waiting for my 10 year old son to 
become old enough to drive.  Sadly, he 
will probably be to tall to drive in it 
as well.  Like I said, if you are over 
5 foot seven, make sure you will feel 
like a tuna trapped in a cheap tin can."
mini,cooper,2002,kilian, 05/06/2002,The only problem is the crowd.,5,"Great fun to drive. It took a little
while to get the hang of the folding
seats when someone gets into the back
seats. The headlights are great compared
to my 1988 VW Quantum synchro
stationwagen. Only 250 Miles so far.
Wheel rims needed cleaning from brake
dust after only 100 Miles. I hope it's
just from the breaking in period. I love
this car, and I hope to have it for many
many years."
mini,cooper,2002,intro, 05/08/2002,Why did I listen?,1,"I based my most recent purchase, a 
MINI, based on the 18 reviews here on 
Edmunds.  What was I thinking?  I think 
many of the people here on the board 
must not really own a MINI.  Except for 
reasonable gas mileage, not much good 
to say about this car.  Might as well 
go get a Toyota Prius or something."

turns. Features and controls are 
comfortable and within easy reach.    
Overall, I am very pleased.  The only

on the hwy. Looks great inside and 
out. I have the British Racing green

buy a bigger car.  Its a $20000 car.  
How much performance do you want.  It

expecting the car to handle like a

drive a bmw 328is and race autox dsp.  
I have the opportunity to test drive 
both the Cooper S and Cooper, and I

the highway and city driving.  Even 
when you are driving at higher speeds 
you don't feel like you are in a small 
car, it feels stable and secure. Very 
roomy interior, and I like the set-up 
of the gauges.  It may only be a 4 
cylinder, but it's zippy and gets great 
gas mileage. I am very satisfied with 
my MINI."

way it sticks to the road and handles. 
I am 6'4"" and have no problem getting
into or out of this fine little car.  My
MINI will be my daily commuter car.  The
MINI fit all of my requirements of
performance, handling, mpg, price, and
uniqueness.  It is just a lot of fun,
only problem is that I am putting too
many miles on the car, close to 100
miles a day, but what fun.  MOTOR ON...."

review - Now broken in, it is a very 
different car. I feely free to hit the 
red-line and enjoy the performance.  I 
really don't think the car needs more 
h.p. anymore - The car is great!

I do recommend however getting the 16"" 
wheels. The 15's are sloppy in hard 
cornering.  The only complaint I now 
have is the rain gutter - it's made of 
plastic and has snapped off.  

I'm still happy :-) - how some aren't 
is beyond me..."

extraordinary, the performace 
excellent, it's absolutely gorgeous 
inside and out and it's the most 
comfortable car I've ever driven. Those 
that complain about lack of horsepower 
should learn to drive - with proper

in the twisties - no car can match the 
Cooper's handling through corners at

the Price is unbeatable for the car 
you get.  The ride is hard, but is a 
Sport type suspension, no complains.  
I expected a little more from interior

the Japanese competitors. A few things 
have to change in future models like 
the D ring in the hack door... Noisy."

they add comfort.  Mine came with 17"" 
Antera wheels and Michelin 215/40 
tires, making its handling 
unbelievable.  

I don't understand the people who say 
the car does not have enough power.  If 
you know how to drive 4 cylinder with a 
stick shift, there is more than 
adequate power.  And don't buy it on a

mini,cooper,2002,Darren D, 07/01/2002,What a deal!,4,"The MINI Cooper S has NO competition! 
Think about it...sports car speed,
sports car (or better) handling, great
style & looks, great fuel economy for
the performance, all at an unbelievable
price!  Compared to the WRX which I was
seriously looking at, the MINI has more
low-end torque (no turbo lag here),
better handling, more luxury options,
better looks and is $4,000 LESS!  Plus,
a 6-speed manual!  I have to agree with
some of the others - if you can't get
the S to move with the 6-speed manual,
you aren't a very good driver.  A good
driver will have great acceleration and
power at any speed.  Very highly
recommended.  Make sure you test drive
the S."

inches taller and wider, but it is 
about 2 feet shorter.  It amazes me 
that people have commented that they 
are tired of seeing the tires of other 
cars, because the driver's perspective 
in a Mini is the same as that of any 
other sedan ... actually the Mini sits 
a bit higher than my Tercel. When I

It reminds me much more of a moped than 
a car.  Sure, when I was 12, the MINI 
might have been fun.  Now it is just an

months and keep wondering what is 
wrong.  It just does not seem that fun 
to me.  Many people talk about how fun 
to drive it is, but I think it reminds 
me more of my old Daewoo than a nice 
BMW.  Where is the acceleration?  I 
cannot find any low end power.  The 
dealer keeps telling me do not expect a 
ride like a BMW but something more like 
a Mazda.  I did not find that very 
comforting."

Bavaria.  Underpowered.  Unrefined.  
Poor build quality.  I am just thrilled 
I did not sell my 325i when I picked 
this one up.  Within a week there must 
have been a wiring error because the 
car simply died on the highway while I 
was going 70.  The Mini dealership said 
this has happened to a couple others

closing because somebody failed to pick 
it up.  I drove it home.  What a 
blast.  Ducati riders slow down for a 
look on the 405; ""fast and furious"" 
types in their slammed Acuras ogle it, 
as do their girlfriends; commuters 
speed by and then circle it for a 
second look.  I am hooked.  It 
satisfies the desire for quickness, 
style and handling and is not as 
frightening to drive as my dear

It takes a while to get used to the 
rubbernecking & comments.  Folks don't 
know MINI is a car company - the 
refrain ""But who makes that?"" after 
I've said MINI might get old, but I 
don't mind now.  It's a great car - 
don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  
It's a fitting sibling to BMW -- BMW

USABILITY of the performance that makes 
this stand out from ANY vehicle I have

What is amazing about the S is that 
the average driver (like me) can easily 
make use of the package. On a twisty

this is a big but, car has intermitent

sporadic, which makes it difficult to 
feel safe.  Service does what it can, 
yet issues keep coming up again. Car 
has been in 6 times with almost 30 
days in service. I suggest waiting for 
the 2003 model and avoiding the CVT.  
Hopefully the 2003 S will have worked 
all the bugs out. Also, order the car, 
shop around as many dealers add up to 
$3000 in mandatory accessories above

mini,cooper,2002,jahotchk, 11/01/2002,I LOVE MY MINI,5,"I really love my Mini, I've only onwed 
it for about two weeks, but I already 
have 900 miles on it.  It is really fun 
to drive and especially fun to look at.

I think the best thing about my Mini, 
is that it took me only 15 minutes to 
wash!  Unlike my Mini-Van, which takes 
me about an hour!

It drives smoothly, I love the 
Navigation system and the Auto Air.  
Did I mention the kick butt Audio 
Deck?  Man for a stock desk, that thing 
pumps base.  I was thinking of puting 
an Alpin MP3 deck in there, but I am 
having second thoughts.

I highly recommend test driving a Mini 
prior to knocking it.  They are really 
fun, and I am enjoying ever minute of 
it."
mini,cooper,2002,Tim C, 11/02/2002,Like a supercharged go-cart on rails,5,"Got the car in August. Wow! Great 
styling, great handling, and an 
increadible head turner. My 16 year old 
car-fanatic of a son had been after me 
to get the Cooper S and he was right on.
People stop me getting in and out of 
the car. They pull up along side me (on 
two lane roads) to chat about the car. 
I get smiles and the thumbs up 
whereever I go. And again going their 
is a gas. The bigest problem is that 
there aren't enough winding roads to 
let it loose on...."
mini,cooper,2002,Lucky Andy, 11/06/2002,My 2K2 Mini Cooper,5,"When I first saw the Mini last spring, 
I knew I wanted one. Just what I need 
at my age to make me feel young. I love 
the look of it inside and out. 
Everywhere I go I get Hi fives!"
mini,cooper,2002,pvd, 11/06/2002,Fun to drive,4,"The car is absolute fun to drive. 
Although straight line accelaration is 
acceptable, switching lanes and driving 
winding roads can't be much more fun 
then with this car.

For daily commute the horsepower is 
more then adequate. 

But handling comes with a prize, dents 
and other road shortcomings are well 
fed back to the driver, although in a  
acceptable manner.

Fuel consumption is average. If you do 
your best low fuel consumption is 
feasible, but the car invites you to a 
more robust driving style, hence a 
relatively high fuel comsumption for 
a1.6 L engine."
mini,cooper,2002,minicoopers4me, 10/13/2002,What fun!,4,"This is without doubt one of the most 
fun to drive vehicles I have ever had.  
It handles, it accelerates and it gets 
over 30 miles to the gallon.  I have to 
fight with my wife over who gets to 
drive it.  It's looks seem to have a 
Love it or Hate type of quality with 
people I meet, and you do meet people 
with it.  Be prepared to tell people 
what it is and where they can get one!"
mini,cooper,2002,Johnny36, 07/10/2002,"Gads, I love my MINI !!!",4,"I waited until I had my MINI for month 
so I could get a real feel for it before I 
wrote a review. This has been 
perhaps the happiest month driving 
I've ever had. Concerns for power 
should be reserved until you get a 
feel for the shift/motor. Only now am I 
able to get the car to launch from a 
standstill. The MINI is not a 3 series, 
but it is definitely a BMW. The 
handling is exceptional! I've done 
corners so fast that I'm almost 
slipping out of my seat, but the car 
feels glued to the road. As to looks, 
it's like being a pretty woman; 
everyone wants to say 'hi'."
mini,cooper,2002,Maleko, 10/03/2002,Fun,4,"To all the ""I thought it was a $50,000 
BMW"": Do your crying somewhere else.  
Dollar for dollar the MINI COOPER S has 
to be the best value on the market.  
What other $20,000 dollar car has the 
technology this car has? What other 
$20,000 car has the handling this car 
has? NONE!  This car is fun, fun, fun.  
If you can't figure it out and enjoy it 
for what it is... a fun car... then 
maybe you should go back to your ever 
boring BMW (Boring Mundane Wheels)."

now!"
mini,cooper,2002,concordmini, 11/17/2002,Plenty of power,5,"To all you out there that complain about
lack of power. You need to remember its
a 4 cylinder, not a V8. And being a
sporty car, it is designed to be revved.
Dont be afraid to run it in the 4-6000
rpm range, and I dont mean just
shifting, cruise at 6000 if you need to.
On trips to tahoe (ie:big mountain
climb) I may be in 3rd gear at 70 mph
during some parts of the climb. Its not
a big deal, the engine can handle
sustained 6000 rpm for days. Oh and I
still get 39 mpg round trip (350 miles
up and back down to san francisco area)
Rev it , dont lug it if you need the
power. generally you need to hit 4000
rpm or higher to get the sweet spot in
the horsepower."
mini,cooper,2002,VWBusType2, 12/11/2002,If you drive >5 miles you need this car,5,"I was out cruising in my '71 VW Bus 
when I was flagged down by a guy in 
a '50-something Mini.  We checked out 
each other's rides, and ever since then 
I've been in love with these things!  
Driving them is a blast... racing with 
people on the interstate is even 
better... especially when there are 
curves involved!  The look you get when 
you get to the next light after 
roasting your tires through 1st and 2nd 
is pretty nice too...  The Mini may 
look small and be deemed a ""waste of 
money"" but until you actually drive it 
(if the owner will ever let you) the 
amount of fun to be had is unmatched."

pavement, which might be a problem for 
some, (especially with 17 inch wheels

speed and turns with no problem, and 
personally I'd have it no other way. 
Space is deceivingly large and

excellent except for my wide feet!

the most fun to drive for $20,000 and I 
found it.  The controls fall readily to 
hand and offer the right kind of 
feedback.  The engine pulls strongly 
from 3000 rpm to redline although I 
rarely rev past 6000.  The brakes are 
super although a little darty on uneven 
surfaces.  Selecting gears is a 
pleasure.  And cornering is just 
incredible.  In 2002 I bought my Minin

my 1970 2002 BMW."

and will just about more than enough 
quickness for the average joe. It also has 
suprising cargo space and it gets great gas 
mileage. It is certainly worth all the hype and 
it also worth the extra dollars because of the 
astounding build quality. Don't let those 
initial quality reports fool you."

When I bought it, I thought I would 
sell it and make a few dollars on the 
inflated prices of 2002.  After driving 
it for a few days - I had to keep it.  
This thing handles better than 98% of 
the cars on the road.  It has great 
power, all the comforts of any luxury 
car, and is very safe too.  The 
performance aftermarket is very strong 
too, so there are no compromises to 
owning this foreign brand (thanks

course it is most fun on the twisties.  
I've driven Ferraris, Porsches, BMWs, 
Mercs, and Audis but I wouldn't want 
any other car as a daily driver.  Lots 
of people complain ride is too stiff 
but I like it.  I have had problems.  
Its been into service 
seven times for such things as leaking 
water pump, leaking coolant tank, to 
replace lower steering column, a/c 
howling noise, peeling interior paint, 
and many rattles.  I'm sticking with it 
though because it is just too much fun!"
mini,cooper,2002,aileen, 09/03/2003,Perfect Metro Car,4,"I live, work, and play in Portland OR,
which makes the Mini the perfect car for
me. There are few activities more
satisfying than sneaking around the
behemouth SUVs in traffic or squeezing
into tiny little parking spots no normal
vehicle could manage. I've had this car
for a year and they are an increasingly
common site in Portland, but people
still comment on it on a near-daily
basis. It is impossible for me not to
smile when I see it each morning."
mini,cooper,2002,EricH, 07/30/2003,"Brand new, so subjective to some degree",4,"Raw numbers can't explain the 
experience driving this car! you 
cannot go (or stop) anywhere without 
people coming over and asking about it 
everybody smiles and points and wants 
to know about the car.

 I would upgrade to a dustless 
aftermarket brake pad. The setup of 
the gas pedal in relation to the brake 
pedal makes the car difficult to 
downshift using the ""heel & toe"" 
technique.

fun to drive?"

car. My impressions are mixed. First, I 
also own a 2000 Miata, which was my 
second for them. So, when I got the 
MINI S I was prepared to absolutely 
fall in love. I did, but...little 
things bug me...1st gear is loud and I 
do not understand that, cheap sunroof 
covers, lousy air conditioning, really 
bad. the handling is great, but the 
Miata kills it in my opinion. It is a

How is it that MINI (Read BMW) can pack so much stuff into this price point but no one else can? Bi-xenon lamps in a car with a base price of $20,000! This can not be possible. Then you drive the car, its engine is smooth with a very linear feel to the power, especially considering that it is supercharged. Then you take your favorite corner and realize that it is going to be one of the most fun cars you will ever drive. Taking that corner at great speed, I had as big a smile on my face as I did the first time I hammered on a new 911 Turbo S. The moral of the story is stop reading buy a MINI Cooper S."

Don't be deceived by size.Have pictures of car loaded for ski weekend for 2 adults with 3 pairs of boots, 2 pairs of skis, and a snowboard.    Not even packed.  Only thing I've had to borrow a car for was to borrow a ladder.  Both are better borrowed.  Couple of little troubles (Power steering pump {made noise,took it in}, loose battery conection {had it towed,felt stupid}, vibration on sunroof easily resealed. All under warranty,as are oil changes every 10K.   What a peach. Buying out the lease."

I drive a lot coming and going to work and wanted something other than the traditional Toaster-Box commuter car (PT Cruiser, Toyota Yaris, Ford Focus, etc.) This car has as much equipment as my larger SUV and is just a comfortable and I'm a rather large fellow of 6', 250 lbs. I can still even get four folks in for a run to the movies, mall or what have you. I love it and so far and I'm glad that I bought it. I wish I could have gotten a smarter salesperson at the Mini dealer who told me that there was no certified used program thus causing me to get one someplace else.  Whatever, I do most of my own maintenance anyway."

It loves the snow and handles awesome.  I average well over 30 miles a gallon around town and 40 on a road trip.  It will wiz up Vail Pass at high speeds (shhhh don't tell).

coolant turned brown at around 2500 miles,

windshield and the roof came out while 
traveling at highway speeds. Both were 
promptly fixed under warranty.

This car is my daily driver, and I find it very 
comfortable and a blast to drive! I opted for 
the standard 16"" wheels, which other 
owners have said make the ride a lot more

I had been on the list to buy one since May of last year.  Took over 7 hours to get out of there.  And when that time came, they didn't even bother to clean the car, just handed me the keys, and sent me on my way, without ever even letting me test drive a single one."
mini,cooper,2003,Amber, 10/11/2015,I love my mini - Car lover,4,"Just starting from the time I got the car- I Purchased my mini last year (in 2014).  The seller did not do any maintenance to the car since he owned it (for 3 years) and no record of what was done to the car. I could tell there was something going on with the belt at the time I purchased it. (ended up being belt tensioner) 

We have done tons of maintenance that was overdue along with preventative maintenance to keep it running strong.I literally drove my mini from Florida to California, then from California to Iowa, then from Iowa to Florida and had no issues. Not to mention the little car was weighted down most likely beyond its capacity as I was moving around the country a lot at the time. Here is a list of typical things that need to be replaced for higher mile minis and I highly suggest you look into these parts for replacement if you do own a mini:

*Bypass valve
*PC Valve
*Spark plugs and wires
*Coil Pack (usually rusted connection causing acceleration issues)
*Map Sensors (preventative not really needed at the time)
*Timing chain tensioner
*ATI super charger damper crank pulley (highly suggest you go with a higher grade crank pulley- the stock ones are known to not last) 
*Power steering pump (always known to eventually go bad)
Oil pan and seal
*replaced belt
*fuel filter 
*Suspension bump stops
*Engine Mounts (mine were literally done for falling apart- i went with poly mounts however it will make the car more rigid so more vibration) 

I am a mother with a 3-year-old son. I have a large Recaro Car seat that fits in my car. I drive my car daily and I make road trips in my car. You have to decide personally why do you want an older R53 mini? My husband and I work on our own cars so we don't pay for a mechanic; We only pay for the parts. I highly suggest Way Motor Works or ECS Tuning they have the best deals on parts from what we have found for my mini.
The car is small and rigid so the ride is not as smooth as our 335Xi BMW. If you want something that drives like a Cadillac then think about getting a different car. This is a fun little car that I enjoy modding and driving and I plan on replacing the engine when it comes to that point. I don't plan on ever getting rid of my mini. Is there some maintenance sure what car does not have maintenance especially once you hit 100k miles. Mini coopers are not your Toyota Camry or Honda Civic standard car they are for the unique few who find an interest in the silly character and the up and down pro and cons of what all involves the mini.

mini,cooper,2003,Chazz, 05/30/2016,Need space in the garage?,3,"Here was the challenge: Find a decent performing car that would fit in my two car garage along with an electric golf cart and a Chrysler Town and Country.  At the time – about three years ago -  the Fiat Abarth was out of stock at the local dealers and the current Mini was about an inch and a half too long. However the earlier Mini, being a little shorter, would work just fine, so I bought a used Cooper S to replace my Porsche.  The previous owner had installed 18 inch wheels which allowed the car to corner as if on rails but resulted in a really rough ride. After about a year of this, I changed to 17 inch wheels. Much better.  Any car with over 100,000 miles is going to need a lot of things replaced, and the Mini is no exception.  Maintenance cost can be greatly reduced by not using “genuine Mini” parts. For example, I just had the clutch changed (for the first time) at 160,000 miles.  The dual mass flywheel used as original equipment by Mini is made by Luk in Germany. Buying the replacement genuine Luk part from Rock Auto cost me $254.79 whereas had I bought the same part with a Mini sticker on it, the price would have been $734.75.  I think of this Mini as a two person and a dog sports car that surprises many people with how fast it i

mini,cooper,2003,ddealminana, 05/26/2012,"Cute on the Outside, Scarey Under the Hood",3,"I was given this car in 2004 as a gift from my parents. I could not have been happier. After having it for over eight years now, I am ready to drive it into the Hudson. This car has been nothing but one major problem after another. The first year I got it I was on the highway and the car just stopped switching gears above third gear. Luckily that was covered under warranty. Since, I have had the air conditioning go out twice, the power steering go out, windows stopped, door locks stopped, numerous overheating episodes, etc. My poor father has spent numerous hours and dollars repairing this thing. Thank goodness I have him though, because I would have spent several thousands by now"
mini,cooper,2003,Paul Chiang, 05/28/2016,Research the quality issues before you buy,3,"The Mini Cooper is the car to get if you value the unique blend of sporty handling, appearance and cargo space above all else, including reliability issues and the high cost of maintenance and repairs. 

I have lived with a stuck driver's side window and a windshield stress crack for many years. When I brought my Mini in for a recent power steering recall, I was informed that coolant and oil was leaking.  It would cost almost $3k at the dealer or $1.5k at an independent shop. There is no shortage of class action lawsuits for various problems that Mini refused to resolve. 

It's a fun car to drive under the speed limit. I can squeeze a lot of stuff into it. I have been able to transport a folded queen memory foam mattress.

I decided to sell my Mini rather than repair everything and risk facing other issues (clutch, transmission, etc.) popping up in the near future. I paid the MSRP of $17k in 2003 and sold it for $3k to the local franchise dealer in 2016 after another mechanic corroborated the repairs that were needed. I was not able to get anyone on Craigslist to pay more than the dealer.
"
mini,cooper,2003,socalpv7, 10/21/2016,Good for a while...,2,"I had my 2003 Mini Cooper S for just over a year. It was a good year of ownership but not without it's major hiccups. I, too, was one of the people that thought I would be amongst the ""lucky ones"" and not have any of the issues that the other reviews mentioned. I wish I was wrong. The Mini was not bad at first...I got mine with only 57K miles. It was fun to drive, gripped like a go cart, had decent acceleration, and got okay fuel economy. Just over a year later I am glad it is gone (with 64K miles). I miss it, but it was far too expensive to maintain. Here is my list of the things that went wrong while I owned the car (I kept up on maintenance, or at least tried to): 1. Engine would occasionally randomly have issues idling and sometimes shut down. 2. The A/C is basically non-existent. Even with a fresh re-charge it never blew cold or strong enough to make a difference (say hello to sweaty back on hot days). Also, don't know if it was just mine, but anytime the A/C was on, even on low, the car was much harder to drive and would sometimes stall when idling. Acceleration was also drastically decreased. 3. Everything creaks and rattles from the interior plastics, cheap door sound, etc. 4. Clutch/flywheel started making screeching sounds, come to find out flywheel was burning ($1,800 for clutch and flywheel). The dealer said this is a common issue. 5. A/C compressor went out in the middle of the summer ($900). 6. Two days after the A/C went out, passenger window motor regulator failed, couldn't roll window down or all the way up. 7. Headliner was sagging since the day I got it and got worse on cold days. 8. Power steering fluid reservoir always had a leak no matter how many times it was fixed (common issue). 9. Two weeks after the A/C and window regulator went out, the power steering failed. It was a nice August summer turning around the weight of the car with no A/C or passenger window. Luckily enough that was under recall and got fixed. 10. After the recall got fixed I got a list of $3,600 worth of repairs that the dealer said ""red--required attention soon"". Add on the ""yellow--will soon require attention"" and it was up to about $5,200. I decided to part with my MINI at this point. Needless to say, it was hard to sell with such a long list of issues. If you are a college student or are tight on money, this is probably not the car for you. You can get a similar driving dynamic and performance for other cars that will not cost you as much to maintain.
"
mini,cooper,2003,joe troise, 09/12/2015,For Risk-Takers Only,3,"These little cars are very seductive, but beware--the early model Minis are quite trouble prone and as expensive to maintain and repair as a Porsche (not an exaggeration---I checked this thoroughly). Clutch? How's $2400? Engine? How's $6,500 on up? Automatic transmission? Don't even ask. Front brakes? $500. Broken AC? $1200 on up. New catalytic? How about $1800?   Broken sunroof glass? Again, don't ask, you'll have a heart attack.

Plusses: Fun to drive, great acceleration on the S model, plenty of leg and head room for tall drivers, decent fuel economy, great handling and braking (to a point--a Mini does like to hop around a bit). 

Minuses: Not a car you want after it ages. Not a car you want out of warranty. Buy the newest one you can afford. Tend to rattle. BMW cheaped out on these cars. I've only driven up to 2014 or so, and therefore cannot comment on newer than that. AC mediocre due to large glass area, punishing hard ride, jittery handling on rough roads, extremely high repair and maintenance costs. 

In short, if you can't throw $150 a month at  a car to keep it running and safe, then don't buy an R53 or R52 Mini Cooper, or perhaps any Mini Cooper out of warranty. These cars are toys, not everyday drivers.

The transmission gave away and the dealer cost of fixing I was told will be $8000. He states that there was a hole in the transmission and therefore it blew up. Obviously it sounds as though it is a manufacturing problem - but they of course will not admit it and attributes it to my driving.

Then the driver's side door handle quit working so I had to roll window down to get out, until window quit too, then I had to crawl out passenger side. Electrical issues caused all windows + sunroof to open when it rained which ruined the cloth seats. Then it started running out of gas before it was on E. Doors locked shut once so my bf had to crawl out window & I had go out trunk so I could roll window up. Then the tranny quit! $5k for a rebuilt!

Starting in the 2nd month of ownership I began having to replace things--each time a cost of $500-$600 mainly due to the high price of the parts.
Every time I fix something, I have another problem.
I am planning to get a new car once I can afford a monthly payment seeing as I have never gone over 6 months without some type of expensive maintenance.

It has plenty of space for me (6'5""/255 lbs.) and a co-pilot, great car on the highway (which is about 80% of my driving), plenty of power for such a small car and is just plain fun to drive. I skipped on the 'S' model but have not been disappointed with my decision. It has truly been a reliable car - I say this as I'm about to hit 98k. The only major out of pocket expense was a set of rear calipers and rotors - all other repairs have been fairly inexpensive and limited to mostly oil changes every 15k.

mini,cooper,2003,Alejandro, 06/06/2003,The Best Hatchback Available,5,"I can sum up my mini cooper S with 
three phrases, Fun, Quality and Good 
Value.  BMW did not hold back from 
giving the mini the technology and 
design it does for it's big boys (700 
series)
This car is fun to drive everyday.

I never imagined thought that I would 
get 
so much attention from other folks. 
Hence the styling success. For the 
first 6 months of ownership I would at 
least 1 person if not 3 people stop me 
to chat about my mini cooper S.  I look 
forward to many years of motoring 
pleasure."
mini,cooper,2003,Noah's Owner, 06/16/2003,I Love my MINI,4," I bought my Cooper S to use as a daily 
driver and to provide some fun driving 
experiences on the weekends. So far 
it's fulfilled those duties perfectly. 
The build quality is excellent and its 
filled with lots of standard features. 
I didn't add a lot of extra options to 
mine, but I don't feel like I'm missing 
anything. 
 The car has surpassed my expectations. 
Its a blast to drive, its got a 
surprising amount of room inside, its 
nimble in traffic and fairly 
comfortable on long interstate drives. 
I love my MINI!"
mini,cooper,2003,MIssMyVW, 10/28/2010,Cons outweigh the Pros,3,"I purchased this car used in 2007 and I didn't even get 5000 miles on it before the clutch went out on it the first time.  Six months after that replacement, I had to have it back in the shop because the clutch pedal had a master/slave issue and I had to have the cylinders replaced.  Then, just this past week, after approximately 21 months and 9,000 more miles on the car, I had to have the clutch replaced again.   Seriously, while the car looks really cool and is sometimes fun to drive, it is *not* worth all the extra money it will cost you for ownership.  I can't wait to pay this thing off and go back to driving a VW again."
mini,cooper,2003,BAD REVIEW, 08/06/2003,Beware of the Mini,1,"Beware of the Mini, is an all too true 
phrase. Looks cute. Performance in a 
nut shell makes the ""Yugo"" shine. Would 
like to see their saftey tests."
mini,cooper,2003,Eddie Mikell, 05/08/2008,I should have my head examined,1,"I bought this car instead of a miata because I thought I need 4 seats.  WHAT WAS I THINKING?  What a joke vehicle.  It leaks oil, it shudders on acceleration.  It's unreliable.  People will tell you it's the ride man, the ride, but the ride doesn't make up for all the repair bills, or lack of body integrity.  It's cute, but it is a lemon."
mini,cooper,2003,Commando, 01/19/2017,Never again,1,"After seeing the reviews I was very excited to purchase my Mini....I don't think I have ever regretted something more in my life. I don't know why this car is rated so highly. This car has given me nothing but problems. And no one wants to work on it. All the auto shops don't want to work on it. And when I found one that would he told me mini's have problems all the time. That the check engine lights always come on and always have oil problems. The only good thing is that it is cute and gets good gas mileage. Other then that I really have nothing good to say about this car. After mine gets out of the shop I am selling it immediately.
"
mini,cooper,2003,jujuzulu, 12/23/2008,You will not regret this purchase!,5,"This car has been incredible! It is enjoyable, gets great gas mileage and I bought mine back when everyone stopped me to see ""What in the heck is that?"" you're driving. (Fun, at first but ultimately a bit cumbersome! Although once I started talking about it, couldn't stop smiling!). The run flats have been a nice asset, as that has been my only problem in 5 years of ownership---2 flat tires! Motor on, MINI!"
mini,cooper,2003,Dwayne Hayes, 05/11/2009,Long Time Owner - Still Happy,4,"I use this as my daily commuter, year-round in Chicago winter driving with a 20+ mile commute on local roads (lots of stop-and-go). Other than a few interior squeaks from the dash, I have little complaint. I can't find another economy car that can be equipped as nicely and handle solid on slippery roads and high winds. When it comes to running errands, city driving/parking (even grocery runs)  for 6 years we always gravitate to the Mini. Only major repair: I had the fuel injector replaced at 70K. Drawbacks are that it's a high-strung breed - higher revs, noisier on the highways and a bouncy  ride on rough roads. Be prepared if you're a big coffee drinker -- you will need a good, no-spill mug"
mini,cooper,2003,mcoMINI, 09/10/2002,"Looks, hype, and lack of substance",1,"Fun to drive car, though there is NO torque 
below 3k RPM.  Controls are too heavy, ride 
quality is VERY harsh.  Interior too plasticy 
(vinyl seats in a $22K car?!?).  Uneven gaps 
in body panels look bad.  Unpainted plastic 
on body looks cheap.  Stereo isn't very 
good.  Brazilian made Chrysler engine is 
disappointing, (yes, even in the S model).  
To top it off, the dealer is STILL trying to rape  
their customers."

mini,cooper,2003,Caroll Wood, 10/19/2002,MINI 2002,5,"The new MINI definatly has the spirit 
of the old mini.  It performs better 
and you do not have to work on it every 
week end.  The downside is that with 
all the new electronic gadgets and 
improvements, there is a price to pay.  
My MINI has been in the shop several 
times for ""little"" things."
mini,cooper,2003,Garyt, 12/26/2002,Mini S Owner since July,4,"the speed of the car is the most
surprising thing. didnt expect that
quickness out of a 4 cyl. I am 6'5"" and
there is plenty of leg room and head
room. Safety feature of the car and
recent rating of 4 stars is impressive"
mini,cooper,2003,DavidCX, 04/10/2003,This is one fun car!,4,"It's not the fastest car out there, but 
it certainly one of the most fun to 
drive!  It handles better than any car 
I've ever driven in stock form. You 
find yourself taking lots of detours 
just to get on a windy road rather than 
a straight on. Could use a little more 
power though, especially low end 
torque. Unfortunately, the dealers are 
only getting a very limited supply of 
JCW kits. Some people complain about 
the noise and harsh ride of the 17"" 
wheels w/ runflats, but I don't think 
it's that bad."
mini,cooper,2003,Vespa2t, 08/19/2010,Super Fun But Also Expensive to Own,4,"After owning a MINI S for 2.5 years and 15,000 miles I can say this is the most fun car I have ever had. However, it has been the most troublesome car for me to date as well with $2000 in repairs, and that is parts only because I can repair it myself. Now, this is a car that was owned by the lead MINI tech at the dealership for its first 70,000 miles and maintained religiously since new. And now it has rust, yes rust on a 7 year old car. There are two big holes in the sheet metal just below the taillights. Keep in mind when buying one that you are buying a BMW product and thus comes with BMW prices for parts and service. "
mini,cooper,2003,Peter Rorie, 04/22/2009,Think twice-Novelty wears off quick,3," I'm a medical rep. that drives 70 miles a day of hard driving. I've put 10,000 miles and 3,000.00 bucs into the  car!--all new brakes,fan assembly, electric windows,clutch, ect,ect. It's cool for the first month, then guess what? It's just another gutless little car. Resale is still good-(x car salesman). For a toy, it's great. If your gonna make it your work car--buy something else.--If I had it to do again, I'd of bought a clean used BMW 325. I paid 14k a year ago for it--I'll get 9500- in trade for it next month-(already had a quote)- make sure you love em' if you make the purchase--your gonna spend a little $ on it. (Also, MAKE SURE there's a dealer close by) You'll be appreciated."
mini,cooper,2003,Car enthusiast, 11/26/2002,Look at a VW GTI instead,1,"I saw a Mini at the auto show just months before it arrived at dealerships and 
it felt like a hundred $100k vehicle.  When I sat in the vehicle at the 
dealership, there was an obvious difference in feel from the one at the show- 
cheap.  It's not as small as the original, negating any real association.  
While the S version is a decent sporting car, think of the base vehicle as a 
stylish Chevy Metro.  The vehicle is fairly priced- before the dealer markup.  
As of now, neither versions are worth the money.  If you wait, maybe you 
can have one at a more reasonable price (closer to invoice). Want a real 
value in sporting and luxury in a similar car? Seriously consider the VW GTI."
mini,cooper,2003,tcchadwell, 04/24/2007,Street Legal Go-Kart,4,Bought my '03 S used last year with only 25k miles. Runs and looks like new. Great paint job (British racing green). Gets lots of looks wherever I go.  My daughter wants me to keep it for her (10 years until she drives thank goodness). Two friends have one as well and we have all been happy with them. Lots of local owner clubs around metro areas too. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a truly enjoyable car to drive. I look forward to going fo a spin every time. Resale value is at the top of all vehicles made today. Good gas mileage too.
mini,cooper,2003,Chuckie, 02/20/2003,Totally Fun!!!!,5,"I was in the market for a new car when 
its stylish looks caught my eye. 2 
minutes into the test drive and I knew 
I had to have a Cooper S that day.  No 
car I have ever driven is tighter 
around a turn.  Better acceleration 
than I expected from a small car.  
Comfortable (LOVE those heated seats). 
Seats hug you when accelerating around 
a bend. Plenty of front seat room. 
Engine purrs. Brakes great. Can't 
drive it enough... Wish I had a longer 
commute to work.  Go with the S

perfectly.  The trip averaged 33.1 mpg

The driver's door went from only opening from the outside to not opening at all. Now the power steering is messed up. The closest dealer is 3 hrs away and no one else will touch it, plus it is expensive to fix. The cup holder is extremely inconvenient, w/ being such a small car they really should move it.

Engine is weak in the low range, but 
once you pass 4000rpms, then you get 
all the power. It reminds me of my 
Civic VTEC. ( and this is weird for a 
supercharged engine, though).
Anyways, the car drives like a go-kart, 
and that is the main reason why I

Suspension and handling are sharp,

pretty good.  The clutch is soft.

The interior is spacious for two.  The 
looks really are to die for!  Prepare 
to spend a lot of time talking to 
passer-bys, and people at the pump.  A 
guy in an M3 challenged me to a race,

as plastic as a Fisher Price toy car

b/c I wanted this just based on how cute it 
looks !  Not as reliable as I wished it would 
be !!"
mini,cooper,2003,Hobbs, 12/03/2002,Mini Madness!,4,"Just got my Mini. First Thoughts: Fun, 
fun, fun to drive!! Lots of looks from 
passerbys, Handles very 
well.                                   
                                     
The Good:'Sport' Automatic impressive. 
Love the Sunroof and the 
seats 'Pleather' look like real 
leather. I enjoy driving it every time 
I am in it. I suggest the 'Indi' Blue 
color with black roof.                
                                     
The Bad: No interior storage space a 
big bummer. Radio controls on steering 
wheel should have an AM/FM toggle 
switch. CNN rates the MINI the worst 
(most costly $$$$) in 'bummer' crashes."

falling apart"

new model car I took a chance. Ive been 
driving it religously for three weeks 
and absolutley love it and fall in love 
with it more and more. Not only do I 
feel special since not many people own 
one, but driving it is the best part of 
my day. 

The performance is awesome on this car. 
I takes off nicely and is a solid and 
great handling vehicle. i must admit 
that I am nervous about the future of 
this car but right now I am just 
enjoying every minute. BMW mini is 
wonderful!"

so much joy."

remember to look and see what will 
arive and if thats what ya want buy 
it . but at john roberts you have to 
put a $1000 down payment before you 
even sign the papers to reserve the car.

mini,cooper,2003,pxlmxr, 12/19/2002,Love the MINI,5,"When the lease was up on my BMW Z3, I 
decided to look for a more reasonably 
priced car- but i did not want to 
sacrifice performance- I decided to get 
a MINI. So far the car is a blast. The 
first thing I noticed was that it 
actually handles better than the Z. I 
love the design of the car inside and 
out, and the fit and finish is what you 
would expect from BMW. Though the car 
has a little less muscle than my other 
cars, it is far from under-powered and 
the low price means that I can buy the 
car rather than lease - so now I get to 
work on it and make it go faster on my 
own. I would recommend this car to 
anyone who loves to drive-"
mini,cooper,2003,Topper, 01/02/2003,Even Better Than Advertised,4,"Looking for performance and a car 
that's fun to drive, I originally 
looked at Porsche's Boxter...great car, 
but overpriced, given the competition 
and speed laws in the U.S.

Next stop, Mini-Cooper's S Model.  All 
the fun, acceleration and corner-
hugging thrills of the Boxter at half 
the price...plus, there's 
more 'attitude' and whimsy with the 
Mini that Porsche's upper-brackets 
simply can't offer.   

In sum, an excellent driver's car that 
never fails to excite or bring a smile 
to your face.

They're worth the wait."
mini,cooper,2003,GOJIRA, 01/03/2003,What a great car....,4,"I have waited for the Mini S since it 
was first talked about several years 
ago. It was worth the wait. This car 
has been beautifully executed. My 
girlfriend and I have had it for 4 
months now and we still smile like 
children every time we drive it.  
Performance is top notch but it is also 
and incredibly safe car. 
QUESTION FOR THE NEGATIVE COMMENTATORS: 
Do you even own a MINI? Or is it just 
sour grapes speaking?"
mini,cooper,2003,jarys, 01/03/2003,The Cooper is sweet,4,"This car is fun! The styling appeals to 
both men and women as it is cute yet 
fast and handles like nothing I have 
ever experienced. High tech computers 
control every function. Run flat tires, 
oil changes every 15k and outhandles 
everything on the windy road. Stopped 
every day by men and women to see the 
car."
mini,cooper,2003,acrossit, 01/02/2003,really fun to drive,4,"If you want a quick responsive car this

mini,cooper,2003,631, 01/04/2003,The best car on the roads!,5,"This is the best car I have ever 
driven.  The ride is great. The 
handeling could not be more perfect.  
Also when the car starts the engine 
sounds so nice.  No upgraded muffler 
system is needed on this car.  The back 
seat is a little tight to be in for a 
long time, but the front is very 
comfortable.  The speedometer is not as 
hard to read as one might think.  It is 
an excellent car for anyone to drive."
mini,cooper,2003,anglophile, 01/04/2003,2002 MINI Cooper,4,"I'm ecstatic about my MINI since I'm a
long time British car enthusiast and
have been waiting for the opportunity to
buy a  new cheap and cheerful car from
England for years. So far it's more
reliable than my classic British car and
gets as much attention. Handling and
braking are superb, but the engine could
use more lower RPM power. CVT
transmission performs well. Cold weather
package and sport seats highly recommended."
mini,cooper,2003,tcihil, 01/11/2003,Indi Blue white roof and wheels,4,"The MINI is a breakthrough car for the 
U.S. and finally may make smaller cars 
fashionable.  It's refreshing to get 
real sports car handling in an average 
priced car.  After about 2500 miles, 
I'm still looking for a chance to try  
the great high-rpm acceleration that 
was a blast in the demo, but this is my 
car now and I baby it a bit."

$10,000 more and this little car would 
still be a great deal!  There is not a 
car on the market right now that does 
not even comes close to the MINI!"

up,wax,look at and  of course motor 
in.  We use it everyday and have had a 
great time everytime we get in it. We 
are getting 29mpg, lots of looks ( good

mini,cooper,2003,xiaobai, 01/27/2003,"Nothing Better for $20,000",4,"Considering what cars consumers 
get these days for $20,000 the Mini 
Cooper S is sent from heaven.  I am 
willing to say that most people have 
never experienced the kind of 
attention one gets driving around in 
one of these things.  Everybody I 
meet loves it.  It makes people smile 
and that's very rare for an affordable 
car.  This isn't a Porsche, the 
performace isn't stellar, but it's very 
fast, very agile, very beautiful, very 
well made and thought out, and very 
impressive overall.  It's not for 
everyone, but for a 23 year old, just 
graduated from college, architect 
with no family and not too much 
money; you can't possibly find 
anything better, period."

nice to have a little more torque

love the car."

mini,cooper,2003,HonoluluDoug, 02/18/2003,Drive it like you stole it,4,"The essence is this: the MINI Cooper 
(particularly the S model) is a driver's car.  
This is the most fun I've had driving a car, 
ever.  The unofficial motto says it all: ""Drive it 
like you stole it!""  Driving it like you have 
your mom in it is no fun at all, and it's worse 
deal for your mom.  Very direct, tight,  
steering, brakes, and shifting make for a 
rewarding experience.  Choosing a new car 
is always a gamble, but after two months of 
driving it like I stole it, I feel like a winner."
mini,cooper,2003,spenser weppler, 02/21/2003,Being a Teenager again,4,"This car is great it's like driving a 
go-kart it takes corners amazingly and

rough pavement especially with the 15

minimized."

mini,cooper,2003,coasterguy, 02/22/2003,"YEAH, Baby!",5,"MINI promotes togetherness, freedom, 
and above all: FUN!Togetherness 
happens, since all you have to do is 
park at the local grocery for a few 
minutes and soon a crowd with gather. 
Freeway driving makes you a rolling 
conversation piece, as carloads of 
folks all press their noses to the 
window for a better look at your MINI. 
Freedom happens because your MINI will 
take you anywhere you want to go, do it 
in style, and not break your gasoline 
budget in the process.
FUN is the key, though. It's impossible 
to drive this car without a big, goofy 
grin on your face..."
mini,cooper,2003,Indygo, 02/24/2003,1 Month Review,5,"I had studied the car for almost a year
before getting it.  I've now had mine
for a month.  Most of the production
kinks have been worked out, and the car
is something else.  It's real fun to
drive, an eyecatcher, and very
comfortable.  The dual sunroof feature
makes the car extra roomie inside, while
the on steering radio controls let you
enjoy driving the car."
mini,cooper,2003,Mike03CooperS, 02/25/2003,'03 Cooper S w/Sport Pack,4,"It is an incredibly fun car to drive
when either on a country road or in a
hurry, having to weave around sport
utilities.  Handles just like you've
read about - point and shoot - but the
ride is a bit rough on bad roads with
the 17's, as you'd expect.  Strong
enough motor - could use another 40hp. 
Brilliant car.  HIGHLY recommended."
mini,cooper,2003,jstwpb, 02/25/2003,Best Value,5,"When I first saw the MINI I was 
impressed with the retro interior and 
exterior styling.  After test driving 
the car I knew that I had to have one.  
It handles better than any small car I 
have ever driven. I got mine with 
premium package one and the sport 
package.  I felt that these were an 
excellent value. These packages 
included may features found on cars 
costing $10K-$25K more than my MINI."
mini,cooper,2003,SleepeeK, 06/10/2003,Too much fun,5,"1st new car, 1st stick--fabulous 
experience! The S is quite easy for 
novice manual-drivers (though 
refinement of technique will absolutely 
yield increasing excitement). Fit n' 
finish is wonderful, I've heard not a 
rattle nor had a leak since purchase. 
4.5 months old, 8700+ miles so far I 
couldn't be happier. MINIUSA still has 
some issues to work out (windscreen 
fractures and software performance, in 
my experience) but let's keep in mind 
that it's only in it's 2nd full

expected. "

space is ideally only for 2 people, 
but it does not feel like you are in a 
small car. The steering is tight and 
very responsive as there is no 'play' 
in the wheel. If you move it a little, 
you go that way. The ride is rough, 
but in a sporty way. I can see that 
some may not find it comfortable. The 
six speed manual requires some effort 
too. The amazing thing is the 
handling. It speeds through corners 
with no body roll or any sense that 
you might loose control. Eventhough it 
is a small car, I feel very safe and 
confortable. Now if I can just find 
enough excuses to go out and drive 
somewhere..."

no mechanical issues, sporty, reliable, 
blah blah blah.  
But, putting the practical stuff aside, 
the real reason why I love my Mini is... 
it's a Mini.  Ever since I first laid 
eyes on a classic Mini with the Union 
Jack on the roof, I knew I wanted one.  
There's something about the hum of the 
engine, the distinctive silhouette, the 
pop-art meets old-school rally racing 
coolness of that big speedometer in the 
middle of the dash, and being greeted 
every morning by a smiling, happy little 
Mini.  Yes, Mini owners are a little 
nuts about their cars.  We can't help

it, and that was moving from reverse to 
drive in my driveway.  One oil change

second time, about one month later, the 
cooling fan would not go off, it 
drained the battery and the car was 
stuck in my garage, had to be towed 
again.  Last time we didnt have the car 
for five days, now its been two days so
far.  I dont know if this car is a

up and moves!  Best performance is when 
you're in the ""power band"" (above 2,000

tool around at traffic speeds, and your 
aware of many glances and some outright

mini,cooper,2003,kfuqua, 08/06/2003,MY MINI,5,"I purchased my MINI when I was 
anticipating the birth of my first 
grandchild and I wanted a car that 
would make me look fun and not ""old""!.  
The MINI was just the car for me.  The 
car seat and stroller fit in just fine 
because of the versatility of the hatch 
back and the ability to fold one back 
seat down at a time.  Also the big 
speedometer keeps my lead foot in 
check.  Most of my driving is around 
town and my MINI is east to park and 
get in and out of.  Also I am still 
getting quite a few stares as I go down 
the road (something I haven't gotten in 
a few years).    "
mini,cooper,2003,Catherine A. Gearhea, 08/06/2003,Crowd Pleaser,5,"My son introduced me to Mini's last

up to all my expectations and then some."

nicely designed. Roomy enough interior. 
Nice interior design.
Excellent heat and air. Good design 
overall."
mini,cooper,2003,drm, 08/14/2003,My favorite car ever!,5,"I have owned a BMW, a Mercedes, a Saab, 
and an Audi, and the Mini is by far the 
best car I have ever owned.  I enjoy 
driving it around town, and it is 
amazingly comfortable on long trips as 
well.  The controls are well placed, 
the interior is surprisingly roomy and 
the ride, while sporty, is not rough.  
The handling is superior to any other 
car I've driven, and, of course, it is 
by far the cutest car on the road!"
mini,cooper,2003,minicoop08, 08/06/2003,Luv My Mini :-)),5,"   I have had nothing but great 
experiences so far with my mini. 
Everywhere I go people are stopping and 
asking me about it.It is really a 
unique car.BMW and Mini put a lot of 
time and thought into the remaking of 
this car.Every control you need is 
right at your finger tips without 
having to look for anything once you 
know where they are."

Cooper S, and a 2003 MINI Cooper.  The 
handling of both are superior.  The gas 
milage varies from 25 in town to 33 on

MINI Cooper, I knew I had to have one
since I am an anglophile and have been
hungry for a ""cheap and cheerful""
British car ever since the demise of
British Leyland.

My MINI has been everything I dreamed
about and more. It has reliably
transported me on my 120 mile/day
commute, even during our harsh winter.
Last month, it protected me in an
accident on I-95. After my car was hit
in the rear side, it spun out and
collided with a metal guardrail. I was
unhurt except for a tiny bruise on my
temple. Sadly, my insurance totalled the
vehicle, but I thought so highly of it
that I have a 2004 on order."

mini,cooper,2003,SailorMom2000, 08/25/2003,Best Car EVER,5,"My father was a car dealer, so while 
growing up I drove just about everything.  The 
MINI is the best car I have EVER had!  The 
engineering, reliability, and performance 
match anything I have driven - but all the road 
tests and reviews already prove that.  BUT the 
REAL pleasure in owning a MINI is just driving 
it!  I have been a licensed driver for 33 years 
and I am having FUN behind the wheel once 
again!"
mini,cooper,2003,Vicsmini, 08/25/2003,Love My MINI,4,"Only had a few months. This is my wifes

over again. Outstanding pick-up,front 
leg room, and It's so solid it weights 
more than my Honda Civic."

mini,cooper,2003,miniyup, 08/30/2003,How could you top it ?,4,"I ordered my car in January, paid 
straight MSRP with no mark-ups or add-
ons.  2700 miles now.  My wife and I 
took it on a road trip to Door County 
WI and it makes a fine road car for 
two.  Ok to even carry three people 
with luggage for a short run (2 hrs).  
Absolutely reliable so far.  No 
squeeks, rattles or anything out of 
place - excellent build quality.  Not 
sure I will ever think of replacing 
this car until it completely wears 
out.  In terms of the total package, 
it is way beyond anything else in this 
price range and even many cars much 
more expensive."
mini,cooper,2003,moorlockx, 09/02/2003,'03 MINI S,4,"A fantasticly fun way to get around. 
Unique styling, coupled with good 
performance and handling, and modern 
aesthetics, makes this one of the best 
overall cars I've driven in my 33 years 
on the road. It's a car equally at home 
in town or on the open road. It excells 
on curvey, back roads. If oyu're 
looking for quick 0 to 60 times, look 
elsewhere, but for everything else, 
there's the MINI."

mini,cooper,2003,sonofdoug2, 09/12/2003,A Dream Come True,4,"Never has a car grabbed my attention 
the way the new MINI did when it came 
on the market.  At first, the idea of 
owning one was more of a dream than a 
real possibility.  After I graduated 
from college, I moved home and paid off 
my loans.  Since I was living at home, 
I was able to save up quite a bit for a 
down payment.  Now my dream car is a 
reality, and I love it more and more 
every day."

is the most fun car out on the road,

is it red and black, but I have had 
racing wheels added, red tint, a custom

this car to everyone =)"

Northwest where I rented a mini S.  
From Seattle to Port Angelus and from 
there to Vancouver Island .  Every 
task I asked this little car to do, it 
did in a manner which lets you know 
it's really built to hug the road.  
The response to every curve with the 
leadfoot is what front-wheel-drive is 
all about me."
mini,cooper,2003,MINImorphosis, 07/23/2003,So much fun.,4,"I've had my MINI for 8 months now.  It 
has had two recalls, a few minor 
manufacturing defects, and an 
overheating problem that still hasn't 
been completely corrected but I can 
overlook these problems because it is 
just so much fun to drive.  The dealer 
I purchased it from treats your like 
royalty and provides you with a 
complementary loaner car which takes 
the major hassels out of the service 
issues.  All maintainance is covered 
for the first 3 years, 36,000 miles. 
Can't think of any car on the road that 
is so much fun to drive for the money.  
Happy motoring:)."
mini,cooper,2003,parrotkind, 08/06/2003,Love it!,4,"We absolutely love our MINI.  We have 
had on two autocrosses and a driving 
school at Buttonwillow racetrack.  It 
has to be one of the most fun cars on 
the road and it absolutely is the 
cutest.  It still brings a smile to my 
face everytime I look at it and we have 
had it almost a year.  

The only complaint I can find is the 
lag in first gear especially with the 
a/c on.  I don't usually use a/c, but 
it has been hot this year, and I have 
had to a bit.  Well I am embarassed to 
pull away from a light because the car 
is a slug with a/c on.  With it off the 
car still needs to be in a higher rev 
off the line or it lags in first."
mini,cooper,2003,hd516, 08/06/2003,Just What I had Expected,4,"Generally, I selected the MINI beacuse 
it looks great and was a lot of fun to 
drive when I took it for a test. 
Overall, I have been pretty happy with 
it. It handles very well (actually 
better than any other car that I have 
ever driven). It is pretty fast too, 
but not off of the line. You need to 
get the engine revving a bit before you 
feel any substantial power. Once it 
gets going, it is really a nice package 
to drive. I have been really pleased 
with the car so far. Be prepared to 
have a lot of people ask you questions 
in parking lots and at stop lights. 
This car attracts a lot of attention."
mini,cooper,2003,thaiboxerken, 08/06/2003,Luxury without cost.,5,"If you want to ride in a super sports 
car, without paying super prices, the 
MINI is the way to go.  This car is a 
performance monster and affordable.  
With 37mpg, the cost to drive is 
cheap.  This is a definite break from 
the SUV hodgepodge."
mini,cooper,2003,Homer J, 08/09/2003,Great little car,5,"A blast to drive. Performance and 
handling are exceptional. Off ramps at 
70 mph are no problem. This is 
definitly a drivers car."
mini,cooper,2003,pjhowell, 08/12/2003,Too Cool for Words,4,"I have had my Mini for about a month.  
There have been zero mechanical

Feels solid.  Corners like a go cart.  "

to 80mph fast and you can't even tell 
you're going over 50 (oops, I have 
already gotten one ticket, I think they 
were just jealous of my cute car). : )
Hood stipes are a must along with the 
white wheel, but keep them clean. This 
car gets more stares and comments than 
I thought possible."
mini,cooper,2003,ACNMini, 08/27/2003,Spot On!,4,"I have owned my Yellow S model for a 
month now, and I can confirm that this 
car is nearly perfect.  The combination 
of beautiful exterior design, well 
executed interior design, build 
quality, and economy shows that BMW 
really got this one right.  The car can 
match most sports sedans on a feature-
for-feature basis.  The S model is NOT 
an economy car dispite the fact that it 
gets 30mpg average for me-it is a high-
performance sports car in every sense.  
Pure fun!"
mini,cooper,2003,LieutMoMo, 08/27/2003,"Sexy, Sassy, & Sweet",5,"This is the best car I have ever 
owned.  If you don't like to recieve 
attention, stares, questions, hoots & 
hollars from fellow motorists, then 
this car is not for you.  Whether you 
are making a quick trip to the store or 
a road trip across the state, the 
cooper always manages to keep its 
passangers safe, comfortable, and 
yerning for more.  "
mini,cooper,2003,Mini Inu, 08/28/2003,Fun 2 Drive,4,"Car is just fun to drive, period. Its a little 
bumpy for a daily drive, but not too bad. You 
really realize how small this car is when you 
pull up next, or park next to a SUV.
Need a little more HP, for some driving 
enthusiast, so see about the JC Works kit. And 
buy the S, it is worth the extra HP, as a 
minimum. 
Sunroof is also a must! Harmon Kardan is nice, 
but I never heard the stock. Again, worth the 
extra cost."

bi-monthly 600 mile round trips. I've 
owned it 6 months and have 3000 miles 
on it. I use it locally when I decide 
to go somewhere without my Doberman.You 
must be a light traveller, great sound 
system, excellent instrument panel, but 
not much room for other than a trip to 
a grocery store. If you're gonna travel 
a long distance, pack as light as

days of flying along in a go-cart. 
Except Mini's allow you to feel in 
much more control than a go-cart.It is 
glued to the road at serious speeds. 
It feels great for doing anything. If 
you looking for attention this is the 
car you need and well,if you're not 
then you can just outrun em'. I love 
everything about this car. I went with 
just the normal and although the power 
isnt totally there.I feel it is 
enough,although many people do not. It 
isnt too expensive on insurance and it 
will definately be the most fun you'll 
ever have in a car."
mini,cooper,2003,bumpka, 09/27/2003,You couldn't give me any other car...,5,"This car is amazing. It has everything 
you could want. I have owned my Cooper 
CVT for about a year now and no 
problems here, just smiles. There are 
only 2 reasons I had to go back to the 
dealer: 1) state inspection 2) a black 
trim piece around the wheel well was 
coming up and was replaced under 
warranty. This car is a blast to drive-
-good acceleration and sometimes I 
don't even notice that I need to slow 
down of curves."

to look at, dynamite handling, 
shifting, etc..

BUT, the quality has been a joke. 
1.Steering column replaced: 4 times 
for clicking
2. Sunroof rattles in the front (they 
fixed it,) now rattles in its frame
3. Seats squeek, fixed three times
4. Finishes scratch WAY easier than 
any other car I've had
5. MPG is not too great, usually 23, 
city
6. AC fan loose. Fixed
7. Reflector fell off
8. Service is pathetic, and usually 
takes 3 attempts to fix anything
9. Trunk lid rattles in its place

screwed together. "

mini,cooper,2003,Minnie Driver, 10/07/2003,Mini Cooper S w/sport & premium,4,"I've never paid MSRP for a car before, 
but I would say that this car is worth 
it. The buying experience is extremely 
easy & fun. Mini is constantly sending 
me nice goodies in the mail, & customer 
service has been great so far. Like how 
you can order exactly what you want on 
the car. A VERY fun car to drive with 
lots of pep, great handling & brakes. 
The int & ext design continues to draw 
looks, and it's refreshing to drive 
something different. I'm used to an 
SUV, but quickly acclimated to this 
small car which feels roomier inside 
than it looks. The ride is firm, but I 
expected that. Love all the BMW 
features without the BMW price."
mini,cooper,2003,Frederick Stecker, 01/11/2005,I love my MINI,5,I have taken my MINI Cooper -S through a variety of conditions and have only two complaints.  The first is that the rear view mirror is decidedly too small; the second is that the run flat tires do not fare well in the north country in early spring driving.  We have a phenomenon called frost heaves and driving with rigid tires can slow one down to a speed of 5 mph.  I've sloved this problem by buying extra rims and having baloon tires for spring motoring.
mini,cooper,2003,Minius, 10/10/2003,Worth the wait,4,"This car is the most fun to drive of

waiting in great anticipation for 10 
months for production and delivery, it 
hasn't been a disappointment. 
Although, it does seem to have a lot 
of little noises that come and go. 
Hopefully, this will be worked out.  
Gas mileage would be great, exept for 
the added cost of premium gas.  "
mini,cooper,2003,Not2Mini, 10/21/2003,It's a Lemon,2,"I waited three months for this car and

mini,cooper,2003,Fangio, 10/22/2003,A Pip,5,"When reading that John Cooper (Paris 
Dakar Minis) and BMW teamed up I 
couldn't resist.  Just bought a 1904 S 
and it is a sheer delight to drive.  In 
its class it holds its ground 
beautifully with the Porsche Boxster 
and Cayenne Turbo I drive."
mini,cooper,2003,Jessalex, 10/22/2003,Could it be cuter?,4,"I just got it and liking it so far.  
Steering is very responsive, the 
shifting is smooth and logical, the 
heat seems to work well and overall it 
handles nicely.  The design is clever 
and funky, with some very intelligent 
and well-thought out touches.

It lags somewhat going up hills.  The 
rear window is extremely small. Rear 
passengers have no control over 
windows...theirs is fixed, and yours 
determines how much air they get. 
With limited space I think they did a 
good job with the small things, but 
overall I would like to see future 
model years (I have a 2004) add a 
little heft so I don't feel like I'll 
crush it if I look at it wrong."

Ok, I've had to add oil here and there, but that's true with many turbo/super charged car.I'm a little bigger than the average guy, 6'2"" but to my surprise the car is just right. I've even made trips with my family, wife and two boys 10 and 11 y/o in it and haven't had any issues with space.

mini,cooper,2004,Kramer, 01/07/2016,"My ""Lil Blue""",5,"I wanted a Mini for three years, and after much research and patience I finally bought one! I cannot say enough amazing things about this car, but first what I learned from reviews was DON'T BUY AN AUTOMATIC. They have major problems. (I only buy stick anyways) And the ""S"" model may be faster but seems to have more issues. So I bought the good ol' regular Coop. I just bought it with 99,000 miles and it drives and rides like it's brand new! It's it so fun to drive, ever night after I get off work I find myself aimlessly driving around because it's so fun to drive. The big mph gauge in the middle is awesome, and everything has a round and sophisticated feel to it. The clutch is so smooth. It handles like a dream. The seats HUG my back, even my dad was really impressed with the car. (And he's owned over 50 cars) He owns a Mercedes convertible which is fun to drive, but I have to say I enjoy driving this more! The second I test drove it I knew that was it. The car just feels like one with you. I will keep this car going for as long as possible unless I get a newer one. You are missing out if you don't have one! Just do the maintenance yourself and you'll be fine.

mini,cooper,2004,ksunshine11, 04/12/2012,Best car ever!,5,"I bought a 2004 base cooper with 90,000 miles on it and I couldn't be happier! Getting 36-38 mpg average, and I don't drive like a grandma! I did my research beforehand, learned cvt transmissions and standard automatic transmissions have major problems, but standard manual is fine. Also the supercharged have water pump and cooling system issues, they do have 60 more horsepower (but only .2 sec faster than base, wth?) Repair cost are about the same as any other car, just dont take it to the dealer! But DO stay on top of maintenence. Go for the base manual, you won't be disappointed!"
mini,cooper,2004,John S, 08/27/2006,MIN-E,4,"I bought my Mini Cooper S used with 17,000 on it for a fair price.  It is one of the best cars ever driven. People stare, smile, and ask questions wherever you stop.  This car is fun, fun, fun.  That's all you can really say. Downside - this is not a family car, but it is perfect for two and the occasional three or four.  At 20,000 miles, I had to have the slave cylinder replaced (leaking).  This was all taken care of under warrenty. "
mini,cooper,2004,Honda owner now, 10/26/2010,Mini USA's little ATM machine!,2,"With 60k miles on it CVT transmission failed on the freeway at rush hour, they tried to charge me $10k to replace it, talked em down to $3k but still then the fuel gauge, again, leaving me stranded on the freeway $1200, then the power steering $1000, then the mysterious $1200 thermostat repair that took them over a week to diagnose, apparently I hit a pot hole on the way home from the dealership (I have no memory of hitting anything) but the next day all the radiator fluid was on the ground so back she went to where they set me back another $2200 for a new radiator.  I'm not even listing the numerous repairs that cost under $500 that I had to do, all for a car with less than 85k miles. "
mini,cooper,2004,hankmanz, 08/29/2012,A great car if you have a spare one and money,2,"It holds the road like it was glued to it and it is easy to drive, but after that it is all bad.
I have lost track of the repairs it has needed.
Three transmissions and four clutches with the first transmission and clutch at 10K so it isn't the driver.
The front air dam falls off it you even touch a curb.
The leather seats are falling apart.
Heat and AC haven't worked in two years.
The third stop light leaks and goes bad every couple of years.
The muffler failed at 21K. The key doesn't work if you are more than ten feet from the car.
I would never buy another even though the repair record on the newer models looks a lot better than the one for 2004."
mini,cooper,2004,johnd, 06/13/2008,Great car but...,4,"Great car, fun to drive. Cute as a button however, we are noticing some build quality issues. At 40K, radiator leaked, replaced battery 2 times, new belt tensioner, new engine seals. I don't know if the mechanic knew what he was doing but I found out the  dealer sold his dealership shortly thereafter and all new people are working there now. Not too happy with the repairs."
mini,cooper,2004,EX MINI owner and RELIEVED!, 04/11/2017,I lost a LOT of money buying a brand new MINI,2,"I bought my car brand new in '04. It was a daily driver. I drive responsibly, care for my vehicles, and prefer to hang on to a vehicle rather than trade up as soon as possible. I still have a '65 Bug, a '76 Chevy Nova and a '91 Cadillac on the road. The MINI was the WORST INVESTMENT I HAVE EVER MADE, IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. In somewhat chronological order, it's failures included: constantly rattling speakers, replaced on two or more occasions; broken motor mounts (the dealer thought it was the clutch and replaced twice. Later, there was a recall on said motor mounts); Panel lights that would turn themselves off; Speedo and tach would randomly impersonate windshield wipers; Exterior trunk latch stopped working; fuel pump failure; Steering cooling fan failure; Steering rack needed replacement; Whining transmission. The car was well over 24K off the lot. 6 years later, with 80K on the odometer, I sold it for 3200.00 as to carry out the repairs would have cost a small fortune.

mini,cooper,2004,Chris P, 07/11/2009,MONEY PIT! DON'T BUY!,3,"I bought my 2004 mini cooper in the summer of 2008 used.  I am the second owner.  It is a blast to drive and gets tons of curb appeal.  However, it is a complete piece of garbage.  Literally over night about a month ago...the engine started to sound like a blender.  After going to 2 mechanics to get opinions...I need a new transmission!...which baffles me since it is manual and i drive very carefully.  Many other small problems, such as pwr windows breaking, airbag sensor light turning on, squeaky brakes, terrible to drive when A/C is on.  It is SOOO expensive to maintain.  I am currently looking to trade it in before problems get worse.  Complete garbage.  Dont waste your money."
mini,cooper,2004,Robert, 06/11/2008,Great car up to a point,4,"Everything was fine until the warrenty ran out. I bought my Mini in April, 2004. The car ran great until my extended warrenty expired at 75,000 miles. The first thing to go out was one of the engine sensors - that was about $700. A little later I took it in for a tune-up. The dealer noticed that a seal was leaking and with the tune-up I was out another $1,300. As I was leaving they mentioned that some item in the suspension would need to be replaced soon to the tune of another $1,000.  About two months after that I lost the power steering.  Enough was enough, I traded it in on a Honda. It's a great car if you can afford the maintenance   "

I got the car with 39k i think and now I am at over 90k and haven't had any real problems out of it. I really wish that it was easier to work on. Im a 24 yr and am not made of money to go to the dealer every time I need to change the oil. I haven't had any tranny problems like all the other comments, but Im guessing that theirs is automatics."

The single largest expense was the clutch flywheel. I have it repaired at an independent shop where I purchased the car or it would have been twice as expensive. I called the dealer to compare prices. I was able to get 286,000 mi.on my last clutch so I do know how to drive a car without abusing a clutch. This car has been a delight to own otherwise. I have been tempted to sell, but I love driving it. I keep hoping each repair is the last. Let's hope it is. I do agree each time I take it in, just to get oil changed, it cost about $1000.00.  "
mini,cooper,2004,spencer wiley, 07/25/2010,Best car all around,4,"My MINI is the best car I have ever had. I have the John Cooper Works model with work done making 249 hp. Besides the incredible power everything else about this car is spot on. For the money the interior is GREAT quality and flashy. Nothing is broken or falling off. I get 40 mpg highway with the work done and all. With 47k miles and the only problem was a leak in the slave cylinder. All in all the most fun car in the world. It is cheap, economical, high quality, fast, great handling, attractive, and always puts a smile on  your face"

While small, there is plenty of room in the front seats, but at the expense of the rear. First generation R53 MINI Cooper S is definitely more reliable than the second genarion that came out in 2007. Easy to modify with a 15% reduction superchager pulley and cold air intake to get this car around 200 hp.

Not a cheap fix, believe me, to say nothing of the inherent danger in losing all power without warning."
mini,cooper,2004,JoBob, 03/21/2010,My Mini,5,"If you lease this car it's great! I bought it, and I keep buying it every time I go in for the scheduled service. I am going to miss this car after I trade it in. The money it costs to run it is 10 times the amount you will save in gas costs. Also you need to pack a lunch to drive to the very rare and exclusive mini service dealerships.After you get there eat that lunch you packed while you wait for hours to find out that there is more than just an oil change. Have a strong heart for the bill you get. I know for a fact I could have been driving a Lincoln cheaper than this. If you have lots of money and time to blow, buy this car! "
mini,cooper,2004,denvermike, 08/13/2008,Love it - Great value for the money,4,"This car is a blast to drive. It spoils you. From the quick acceleration, to the continued power through all 6 gears, combined with sharp handling = tons of fun. Add in the great fuel economy and the unique look and it's just a great car. And if aftermarket tuning is an interest for you, this car has tons of potential available for simple/non-intrusive changes. You can easily add 40+ hp without doing anything radical.  Warning - the summer tires will do you little good in the snow; the car is just too twitchy. I purchased a 2nd set of rims and studded snow tires and the car unstoppable in the Colorado winter.  "

mini,cooper,2004,Downtown111, 10/24/2009,Midlife Crisis Car,4,"I fell in love with the 09 MINIs the first time my wife and I drove a brand new 08 in the Spring of 09.  But I was reluctant to spend the 28K on the sticker. Then I found an 04 with 50K miles for half that and thought it would be a good way to see if we really wanted one.  This car has exceeded every expectation we had for fun, economy and attention-getting.  We occasionally read about CVT issues for this year, but after 6 months of daily commutes of 70 miles we still love this reliable, trouble-free sports car.  Just put snow tires on for our winter commuting.  My wife thinks it is a sensible choice for a mid-life crisis vehicle, and nothing we have ever owned is this much fun to drive!"
mini,cooper,2004,Eagles, 11/20/2009,Yippee,4,"I bought a cooper S in October of 09. I have always wanted a mini since the age of 16. Now at the age of 46 it was well worth the wait. I have had no bad experiences with this car. It is as fun to drive as it looks. I was hesitant to purchase after reading all the negative reviews. To compensate for unwarranted repairs, I purchased a 2 year extended warranty. I would strongly recommend this car for the person who loves having fun and enjoying life."

mini,cooper,2004,bveracka7, 01/06/2011,My Favorite Little Red Car,4,"This car is a blast to drive. The first thing people notice is how roomy the interior is for a car that is so small. I love the size, it is just right for me. The Mini S gives you the best of both worlds; it's speedy as heck and rides like a European sportscar but doesn't waste too much fuel. I get an average of 35mpg, but you get a lot less if you drive fast. Main things I like are the interior set-up; the dash is beautifully shaped and covered with nice material that's easy to keep clean. I like how the switches & controls are centralized around the console and steering wheel. The interior is not small compared with the outside, and it gives you that feeling of being safe that only a European car gives. When you drive the Mini, you won't feel like you're in a claustrophobic box but rather a pretty comfy sportscar! I've used it to commute 35 miles each way Monday thru Friday for the past 3 months with no complaints or problems. I found mine at a repo-auction where I got a great price on it, although it had 103K miles, it was a clean Florida car with no issues and a pretty reasonable price for me. I will be investing in a different set of wheels and tires for the winter though, as the 17-inch custom wheels & tires don't like snow at all and I can't drive in the heavy snow. I have been told by a fellow Mini owner that with the right tires and wheels, the car will deal with the snow much better."

In 2004 John Cooper and BMW paid tribute to the 1964 MINI that won the Monte Carlo Race.  Only 1000 were produced which integrated some of the legendary John Cooper Motorworks features in a one time production. This car is so fun to drive, low center of gravity matched with a 4 cylinder turbo charged engine with 6 forward gears. Dives like a Go Kart and screams on the highway when weaving between traffic. This car is an exciting little brute that many drivers pay much more to experience the real joy of the sports car driving experience.

The day after purchase , it would red line at 15 mph.  I took it to the local mini dealership, and they told me that it was normal, that I probably was not driving it aggressively enough.  So then it stalled on me at a red light, and they said this was normal, still not driving it aggressively enough. After this happening probably 9-11 times in the 6 weeks I had it, I sold it.  I would have to drive it around the parking lot for about 20 min. to get it to get back to its normal self.  Some people say that theirs goes out completely.

Several months later the oil light came on. It needed a switch, but then also needed an engine harness and starter.  This work had to be done at a dealership and took one week to complete. I was fortunate that they had a loaner available. I am afraid to take this car on a road trip. I am thinking of trading it in on a Honda.  I never had such expensive repairs with my Honda"

It is a tight ride in the seats, so it's not the funnest to drive for long periods of time. NOW! The downfall.  Mini cooper has had problems with the junk transmissions they put into the coopers. Despite being built by BMW, it is not a BMW tranny in the car.  My car has 67000 mile on it and the transmission is acting up in it, the cost to fix it? Try $6000, since mini does not sell parts to fix the bad trannies. Other than that, it's a very cool car to drive until you get to high miles on the car and it will cost you."

car.  I'm 6""4', and can still put the 
seat back another 2 inches.  I have a 
34' inseam, for those of you who 
thought I might have short legs.  The 
car is a pleasure to drive.  After 
driving a 87 BMW 325 for 16 years, I 
expect the car to be reliable.  I love 
the way it handles.  The reviews are 
much to hard on the cars steering.  
There is no play in the wheel, the way 
things should be made.  Just like the 
BMW, the battery is in the rear, with 
a connection in the front should you 
need it.  Steering, braking, and 
acceleration are all very good.  This 
car is a blast!"

fastest- but it handles like its glued 
to the asphalt and seems to be born and

every time I drive it...Corvette and
Porsche owners want to race. To date, I
have been quite pleased with the

flawlessly.

Only complaint is the required high

can hold its own. Pushing down on the 
gas until the pedal clicks to the floor 
and you can feel the car bolt you 
forward. The interior has so much to 
offer. I bought the leather package, 
with GPS - which directs you where to 
go. The controls are conveniently 
located and easily adjusted at a click 
of a button. The standard sound system 
is very good.  Lots of leg room even 
for taller drivers. The dual sun roof 
is nicely engineered. I have had no 
problems with the Mini, other than too 
much attention from drivers. "

mini,cooper,2004,jppd, 10/16/2003,First Months Impressions,4,"Crisp handling is what we are told that 
separates Mini Cooper from its competitors. I 
whole hardily agree. The car has a feeling of 
being glued to the road. After having been 
told that 17"" wheels and 205/45 were stiff 
and unforgiven I would say that on our roads 
in the Pacific Northwest don't exhibit this 
conclusion. Quality of materials is good, but 
the facia is quite plasticy. Powerful heated 
seats are too powerful, but that said your 
bum and back are toasty after only a minute 
or two. 
I'm surprised at the auto air conditioning 
system which seems to be much better than 
on my 2000 Audi A 6. "

break the bank, the Mini S can't be 
beat. Each time you slip into the 
leather seats, pop the sunroof and hear 
the throaty response of the exahust, 
you begin smiling.  Once you actually 
zip off the mark and pull a quick 
corner (all within the speed limit, of 
course), the grin hits your lips and 
doesn't stop till you're parked and 
flip the 'unlock' toggle to end your 
latest fun journey - to the store, 
work, or a weekend away.  Simply a joy 
to drive in every way."

people, but once they see the interior, 
the way it handles, and all the little

mini,cooper,2004,nesad1, 11/05/2003,Automatic Transmission (CVT) is OK,4,"Because most of my driving is spent in 
traffic commuting into Boston, and 
because my wife won't drive an standard 
transmission, I ordered my Mini with an 
automatic (CVT). Now, after a month of 
driving it, I am happy that I got the 
CVT.

The CVT has one gear with an unfixed, 
huge range of variable gear ratios. It 
doesn't drive quite like other 
automatics, but it's more than adequate 
once you get used to it.

In addition, there is ""sports drive"" 
mode built in that makes it run at 
higher rpms and thus makes 
additional torque available in this 
mode. It's a lot of fun when you're 
driving on a road with lots of tight 
twists and turns."

a peseta, it brakes smoothly. Gosh, I 
could go on and on. The design is 
fantatstic.I get about 365-400 miles to 
the tank. I get crazy comments from all 
manner of people. The car matches my 
personality they say. The Mini staff is 
awsome, not pushy, just infomrative and 
friendly. And last but not least, I 
learned to drive it (a stick) on the 
day I drove it off of the lot. Thanks

new Minis run out of handling before 
they run out of horsepower.When driven 
hard there is a lot of chissis flex, 
the addition of a positraction unit 
helped a great deal with wheel 
spin.This car is fun to drive!Very 
quite at 100 MPH and stable, even in 
cross winds.The only problem we have 
had was with the drivers side window

took in to great consideration the fuel 
mileage as well. So far the car has 
been great. It is like driving a race 
car all the time. The gears are very 
short and the clutch lets out at the

is.  Secondly, Mini is lucky that the 
car is so loveable... the rattles that 
this car seems to have already (at 200 
miles) would seem unacceptable in a 
Japanese car.  I find myself at the 
dealer twice already for warranty 
claims... and yet, I really could care 
less.  THAT is how much fun I am 
having.  The handling is impeccable.  
The steering feel is excellent.  Every

Good gas milage.It is comfortable on 
long trips due to the very nice seats, 
ample leg room, and long wheel base for 
its size. Very precise steering 
too...move it an inch and change a lane!
so dont curl your hair/pluck eyebrows/ 
or read in this one..it has 
low tolorance for driver inattention.
Also its one of the few cars I have 
owned that gets this much notice on the 
road, or anywhere it is . It is a 
sports car rather than a muscle car
(rather like a Mazda Miata )meaning 
that its a light ,very nimble car that

A TRUE SPORTS CAR, BUT IT DOESN'T KNOW 
THAT."

and fun to drive. It can be a little 
jerky at times because its very 
sensitive to the touch (in terms of 
steering, accelerating and braking) but 
once you get the hang of it its 
amazing. Really zippy-- it hard not to 
speed in it!!

Its also extremely fuel efficient and 
comfy inside. However, the back seats 
only suit small children because there 
is not a lot of leg room. "

weeks a go.  What a hoot!  Lots of 
room, fun to drive, a head turner

it!.  BMW got it right in designing 
this, and it's affordable.  I was also 
considering an Aidi TT, but this is 
just more fun!"

my car felt just like a video game!!  
This thing is so much fun; it makes the 
drag of New York City driving seem less 
painful-  except the pot holes where 
the S takes a real beating because of 
the stiff suspension.  Otherwise the 
car is the most fun I have ever had in 
a sports car. Forget the hefty Porsches 
and BMWs and Lexus, you won't have 1/2 
of the fun for the double price you 
paid.  The attention this car gets 
exceeds anything.  Like the dealer 
sales woman said, ""You can't be shy to 
drive a Mini!""  I get so many thumbs up 
from pretty girls I wish they would 
flash at me instead!"

them on the movie The Italian Job and 
fell in love with them then, never 
dreaming I would ever own one. We 
dropped by the Mini of Nashville just 
to look and test drive one just to see 
what they were like, with a couple of 
hours I was the PROUD owner of a yellow 
Mini with black bonnet stripes. One 
week later I was offered more money 
than I paid for it and turned it down 
without blinking an eye. That's how 
much I love it! Which is helps that I

after 3000rpm.  We frequently have 3 
large to med adults in the car and 
comfort is good for rear passenger 
2/3 hours driving time.  Front seats 
are excellent and fabulously 
adjustable!  I'm always surprized at 
how small the car is from the 
outside, it seems much larger from 
the inside when driving, although it 
handles like a sports car. "

(as well as an original Cooper S) 
and this car is more fun to drive than any of 
them.

Can hold four adults, including ny 6 foot son 
in the back seat, but I think of it as a two 
seater with good cargo space -- which is 
pretty good with seats up or down."

thoroughly as possible,before making a 
decision to buy, my car turned out to 
be tops in all categories.The fact that 
just about every feature one could ask 
for, was standard, and I could pick and 
choose from a very short list of extras 
without any pressure from the dealer, 
made it as close to a custom car as I 
will ever come. "

car. Handling is fantastic, wicked 
tight.The 6 speed is perfect on the 
highways! Over 160 horsepower, 
allows me to pass in 6th with a huge 
amount of room for pickup!  Clutch is 
smooth. Sticks to the road around 
corners no matter what speed you take 
them.  Gas milage on my long commute is 
fantastic 28-35,depending on weather 
conditions. Believe it or not, I will 
at times drive my family of four around 
town with this car, with no one being 
squished in anywhere.  You can really 
feel the BMW-ness of this car when you 
are inside driving it!!!!!!!!!!!!"

mini,cooper,2004,Maxifun, 01/10/2004,Maxifun,4,"We bought the Mini because we loved the 
original when we where first married 
but were raising/having children. We 
can afford to have a third fun car and 
the Mini is it. I like to drive it 
hard, meaning put it through the 
corners, pass people on the expressway, 
find other Minis to ""race' and get 
comments from Grandmas and teenagers 
re""nice Car"" etc. etc. I din't drive 
the ""s"" when we bought it, because I 
wasn't willing to spend the extra 3K

It easily fits four adults, with 6-ft.+ people in the front seat, or two adults and two dogs.  Parking is a snap and the turning radius is about the same as the car length.  The seats are comfortable even on long drives and road noise is minimal at high speeds."
mini,cooper,2004,Telva Chase, 01/13/2004,Mini Cooper S Loaded,5,"Love my new mini - I've only had it a 
week and it's a blast to drive. I 
don't really miss the low-end torque 
of my Pontiac Firebird, it was too 
much power for a daily commute anyway. 
I know how to get the most out of a 
stick, so I have no issues with 
performance.
I also love having an excuse to NOT 
drive my work friends to lunch 
everyday! 
Even my 6'2"" husband can sit 
comfortably in the vehicle which he 
could not in my Firebird - even with 
the T-Tops off.

much as I love the BMW's the Mini is 
just the most fun to drive.  It handles 
likes a sports car, has more than 
enough acceleration and is more roomy 
than you think possible.  The most fun 
is on two lane country roads that wind 
up, down and all around.  It just sits 
on the road, refusing to move off line 
regardless of how tight the turn.  It's 
only flaw is a backseat that is 
designed to seat your worst enemy.  It 
is not terribly comfortable.
But if you are looking for a fun ride 
and like people waving at you or giving 
you the thumbs up, then you just have 
to have this car."

released. I have complained several 
time to customer service and the

It's so cute and fun. I get more

When I drive people that pull up next 
to me actually look over, and tell me 
(or mouth) how great my car is. It fits 
anywhere, and to contrary there is a 
lot of room inside. I can fit four 
people in there so easily, and they

there was a vibration in the front of 
the cabin that hasn't been fixed after  
two attempts from the dealer. Then the 
passengers side rear tire keeps loosing 
air so the sensor comes on all the time 
and the headlight went out! And this is 
with no accidents! So now a rock hit 
the windsheild and no one can replace 
the glass b/c the car is so unique. I 
have never had so many problems with a

BMW you can be assured that reliability 
isn't an issue, and that safety is #1 
Compare the Mini with any other car

mini,cooper,2004,jswords, 02/27/2004,Best New Car for the Money,5,"The Cooper is the best for the money.  
Although it isn't made for large

singles or couples.  The car has a 
great warranty and almost free

Even the large car companies can't 
match this."

the original, but being the American 
manufacture wouldn't let that happen
even though let ford come out with the
ford fiesta which was the same size at
the time. Im to learning the body style

away or make it happen in small car and
keep a great price "
mini,cooper,2004,Toni, 03/26/2006,My Mini,4,"Minis have everything in a small packet. It's really fun to drive at high speeds.  In the city it's even more fun to drive.  It is small, fast and really good at cornering.  The interior is really goo\d looking. "

I spend an extensive amount of time driving due to work and a long-distance relationship, and have never been disappointed. I am a careful driver and take good care of my car, but made the mistake of using summer performance tires throughout the Wisconsin winter...still handled fabulously! There really is nothing this little car can't do; I read through thousands of reviews before purchasing, and while the dealership inconvenience and fairly high prices for repair remain true, I have had little to no problems otherwise  "

But once you have to fix something on your mini, it can be very expensive. Once your car is out of warranty, Mini USA refuses to take any responsibility for their cars. They will not fix even a manufacturers defect, and cover themselves by saying it is out of the 3 year warranty. They are cute cars but are not made to last. "

I love the feel of it, the size, the leather interior, the ability to get an entire shopping cart in the back. It is fun to drive and has the power I want to get around.  I have had some major mechanical problems:  rear main seal replaced at 34K and now lost a valve at 39K. Seems problems that shouldn't come up at the mileage."

Mine is a decked out Mini Cooper S convertible with all the options and JCW package (except the nav system). Quick & nimble but harsh and jolting ride (17"" run flats + stiff suspension = good looks+performance but uncomfortable) While no match for a hardcore RWD sports car, it has a very good vehicle dynamics characteristics for a FWD. Neutral steer with a hint of tail-out oversteering when pushed. Overly intrusive ESP (but you can turn it off). Not recommended if this is going to be your one and only car. Not many 4 seater convertible that can match fun factor as Mini Cooper"

I have had to replace the transmission three times on the hardtop, the AC failed twice on the hardtop, the AC / heat system failed once on convertible, the ASC light comes on/stays on in both, they have various serious rattles - that MINI knows of - they have had to be serviced.  MINI service has taken care of everything, but I am spending most of my highway driving just taking both cars in for service.  I am regretting having two MINIs that have so many service issues.

mini,cooper,2005,Vanessa Nobrega, 09/20/2015,Dream car turned into nightmare car.,2,"Growing up I'd always dreamed of owning a mini cooper, and last April, that dream became true when I purchased a 2005 Mini Cooper S. The Carfax report looked good and there were no issues with it. I bought it with 75,000 miles on it, and within the past year, I have put thousands into fixing things. My tachometer stopped work, my break lights would stay on when the car was off, I had to replace the alternator, the pulley system, serpentine belt, and alternator clip. Luckily, the dealer I bought it from is a family owned and willing to help anyone out, and took it right off my hands this past weekend. I would never buy a used Mini again, because all of the problems came out of nowhere, and my Local Mini Dealership did not have any clue how to fix most of the problems. After replacing the body control module, my tach still does not work, and when it is dark out, I can't see how fast I am going as the lighting is out. Luckily I only have a couple of days left with my ex-dream car. LESSON LEARNED!!

Repairs needed by 25,000-30,000 miles indicate that many of the components just aren't the sturdiest (wheels, tires, multiple oil leaks and a power steering fluid leak, suspension parts in need of replacement), but with the work done, it seems like new, and I would like to drive it forever.

mini,cooper,2005,Joan McLeod, 09/20/2016,LOVE My Mini,5,"... But NO cup holders or armrests!!!!!  It's a 2005, with heated seats, navigation, full moonroof. Goes from 0 to 60 in seconds (my favorite part!), and can park in tiny spots (amazingly), and the seat warmers in MN should be standard!  UNFORTUNATELY-- There are no upgrades for the GPS, so I use it only as a live map.  The one cup holder snapped off the first year, so I bought a console with 2 cup holders, that sits on the passenger seat when I'm alone.  (There is a center cup holder for the backseat, which I use, inconveniently; and an ashtray I removed, but it's too tiny to be of much use).  Back seat is way too cramped for adults or children over 54"" tall, but folds flat for plenty of cargo space.  And I'm heartbroken that the trade in value is only $4000.

And that's where the happy story ends. My Mini has had engine recalls, indicator lights fall out (left and right sides), 3 windshield cracks, radiator thermometers explode (twice), random signal lights signaling (i.e. flat tire, check gas cap, service engine) for years on end (""bad computer circuitry""), oil pan leaks, emissions tubes cracked, the metal decal on my steering wheel pop up (twice. who knew that the entire steering wheel has to be replaced when that happens), vanity mirror covers fly off their hinge, battery failures, and more - but I've run out of room. In short, my Mini's been a nightmare."

mini,cooper,2005,riverbendmike, 03/19/2010,Poor Quality,2,I have had nothing but trouble with my 2005 Mini Cooper Convertible.  I have spent thousands of dollars in out of warranty repair bills. My problems have been. 1. Convertible mechanism cable replacement. 2. Oil gasket replacement. 3. Power steering failure (safety issue) 4. Trunk latch replacement. 5. Shift mechanism replacement. The car is at the dealer and the oil issue is being looked at again because I've had to add oil too often.  So that may need to get done again. I'm seriously thinking of just leaving the car there.  There is a reason it has go-cart handling. - It's built like a go-cart.
mini,cooper,2005,Marie, 08/12/2009,So much fun!,4,"This car is the most fun that you can have driving!  Everytime that I get behind the wheel the Mini is ready to go.

mini,cooper,2005,Michael Street, 01/21/2016,A colossal piece of Euro garbage!!!!,1,"The only positives are, they're cute to look at. They get good mileage per gallon. If you can ever keep them running they are fun to drive.
Everything beyond those points is negative.
After 50-60 K miles, they are junk. The parts are incredibly high priced and it's difficult to find anyone who will work on them! Most mechanics make it very clear, I hate working on Mini's of any kind, any year, etc!!! 
I spent a fortune on this poorly designed, poor running, undependable, rattling ,shaking, rarely working piece of junk!! Mini/BMW should be embarrassed to have created, designed and manufactured these rolling disasters. 
The engine is weak. The transmissions are terrible! Both Auto and manual. They are going to fail!! It's only a matter of when and where!!!
I will never, ever consider another Mini/BMW product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Too many warranty fixes from one previous owner and myself to list but include everything from water leaks to fluid leaks to repeat seat cover replacements, front seat replacement, loss of compression, etc. Compared to my previous vehicle, a Miata, it shifts like a truck.  Handling is no where close to the Miata's. It would make a cute 3000 lb. paperweight."

The MINI was nearly perfect with Free oil changes and normal maintenance until 36K. The exception of around 29K, AC unit was replaced. Around 60K the engine mounts and bushings ($700) had to be replaced and then around 100K the oxygen sensor went out with some other parts around it. MINI refused to pay even though it was a known issue ($900 we paid) Later, Clutch 114K ($1700), 114k Cylinder #1 died on the freeway ($2700.) If you keep this car over 100K, find an independent shop, the cost is half. The dealers charges $300 for an oil change, some areas $400. "

The run flat tires wear quickly, but other than that, repairs have been minor and inexpensive.

Bought my fully loaded chili red 2005 model off the showroom floor about as soon as the convertibles became available -- November 2004.

mini,cooper,2005,minicoupah, 05/05/2006,Best in Class,4,"I bought my Cooper with the cold weather, premium pack, and 5-speed transmission. It has the most amazing ride. I'm a big guy and there is no issue with the cockpit.  It is not he quickest vehicle around, but it is fast. This car is VERY stable. Its ride is a bit choppy on bumpy roards though. It goes where you point it, without any steering wheel torque at all. It redlines at over 6,000 rpm and the engine runs and runs. I have logged 20,000 miles on it so far this year. A glutton for performance, I've ordered an '06 ""S"", with DSC, limited-slip, chrono, cold weather, and premium pack #1. As a side note, I rented one with an automatic and took it to Death Valley and the Mojave. I drove it VERY hard and actually beat-on it over 50 miles down the West Side Rd. I chuckle now, knowing just how well these cars are made."
mini,cooper,2005,Gretta0326, 07/25/2008,First of MINI,4,This is one of the most fun cars I have ever driven. I went with the automatic but really wish I had gone with the manual S version. It handles fabulously and is a must-have if you have to park in the city.  
mini,cooper,2005,Sophie, 08/25/2008,Smile!,5,"I am so lucky to be driving a Mini Cooper S for my first car.  I bought it last June and it's never going to have another owner.  Everytime I drive her, I can't help but smile. The supercharger is fun, and the handling is amazing. I learned to drive on a Buick Park Avenue, so the Mini was a dream. With the back seats down, I can fit my 152cm snowboard. Good cargo space. I autocross with my mini, and it's beyond words. Acceleration is good. The auto-manual is a great option!  Also, the winter package, Harmon/Kardon sound system, and sunroof are definitely worth the extra money!  The runflat tires that came with her are terrible, though. I recommend replacing them as soon as possible."
mini,cooper,2005,Loosenut, 10/30/2008,Love hate relationship,4,"The car is so much fun to drive it's addictive. It corners smoothly and accelerates well. The front seats aren't the most comfortable but are very adjustable. The biggest problem I have had is with the new gas containing ethanol. Seems the gas companies add more than the 10% they say they do and the Mini runs lousy because of it. At least that is what the dealer says. Oh yeah, and now the CD player died."
mini,cooper,2005,bebonic84, 11/10/2008,It's a love/hate relationship,4,"Since I bought the car in Nov I've had to make the trip to the dealer four times.

So loud I'd have to turn off my car in the bank drive thru. It's on its way into the shop this week actually to have the front end looked at. The tires were so incredibly expensive that I had to go out and buy run of the mill tires just to make it through this winter. "

But after 4 years, it's time to get an automatic since the wife can't drive a stick. This has been one of my favorite cars I have owned, being in my forties, that's been a lot. It is a blast to drive. I agree the seats could be a little more comfortable, but they're not that bad. The cup holder situation is bad, very bad. Mechanically, I have only had an O2 sensor fail. and those ridiculously expensive tires were replaced too early with normal high performance tires (it is also a weird size had to special order them). The passenger seat has stopped reclining. I will miss waving at other MINI owners and being in the family."

Even though the car looks small on the outside, there is plenty of room inside.  The back seat is very deep so your knees don't touch the back of the front seats.  The gas mileage is excellent.  There could be a few more 'comfort' features in the cockpit, but everything you need to motor is right at your fingers.  The convertible is one touch operation, no latches to fool with, and it has a sunroof option that no other cars have."

The seats have warmers in them if your sidekick gets cold.  The interior is very retro, very cool!  Go and test drive one and I guarantee you'll want one.  It is a little bit high on the price for the S Convertible, but it is worth the money.  If only my wife would let me drive it more!

mini,cooper,2005,Quepr, 04/16/2005,05 Red Mini in Dayton,4,"I have now had my Mini for 6 months. I live in Ohio and was impressed with how well it handled in snow and ice. I also like that everything I need is at my fingertips ie heat, air, audio, mirrors,convertible,etc. The shifting is as smooth as butter. I had not driven a shift in nearly 15 years, it came right back and was soooooo easy. As far as fun, I can't think of a word that can describe fully how much fun it is to drive. The top goes up and down w/in 10 second with the touch of one button. When you roll all the windows up and the top is down you d on't get too much wind. If you have a long commute, it is not very comfortable, other than that I think it is one great little car!! "
mini,cooper,2005,R-Mini, 04/16/2005,We love our Mini,4,"When I began searching for a convertible, most models were out of my price range.  After looking at the Mini web site, I was able to design my own vehicle, with the options that I wanted, and still remained well within my budget.  The handling is precise (15 inch wheels with Pirelli P3000 tires), the automatic transmission flawless, and in all the years of driving, this is the first automatic that I have owned where you cannot feel any up or downshifting.  On a recent trip of over 1500 miles, my Mini convertible averaged just over 33 mpg on the highway.  I would recommend to anyone interested in a convertible to give the Minis a test drive.  There have been no mechanical issues to date."

mini,cooper,2005,jt, 03/25/2006,Wow. I'd buy it again.,4,"German engineering + classy design. My Cooper S is 600 lbs. heavier than my previous 4 door cars (Jetta, Saturn, Accord) but handles like a fighter jet. The power brings out my lead foot, which hurts gas mileage, but I squeeze 350 miles out of each tank of 93 octane (mostly highway driving on my Manhattan to Warrenvile NJ commute).  I considered Hybrids, but their fuel economy evaporates on highway driving.  Mini's handling and standard features make me feel safer (ABS, traction control, 6x airbags, and a really solid, heavy body.)  Street parking in NYC is a dream. I paid $30,000 with all options and have no buyer's regret. Consider getting insurance on your tires / rims: run-flats are $250 each. In NYC you will get a flat. I already had one and the insurance has paid for itself."
mini,cooper,2005,sabinka, 03/27/2006,It's LOVE,5,My Mini Cooper is my sixth convertible...and it is the BEST one yet. It handles like a dream even she likes to fly.  This is by far the best car I've ever owned. PS: my boyfriend owns/ d rives vintage muscle cars and he loves to drive the MINI too.
mini,cooper,2005,MINIpower, 05/21/2006,The MINI Experience,5,"Absolutly everything about owning a Mini is exciting.  My 9 rating under comfort is for the lack of an armrest, but one soon becomes accustomed to that, or buys one!  The car just begs to be driven around tight corners, which are frequently found in my Rocky Mountian town.  It handled great even when it snowed for weeks straight this winter.  The car has much more interior room that would be thought at first glance.  Basically, I do not think that there is any other car on the market in this price range of such good quality!"
mini,cooper,2005,keif calkins, 06/05/2006,Love the Mini,4,We keep the Mini at our beach house.  What a neat car for tooling along a1a. Not a day goes by that someone stops me and admires my Mini. I have never seen a convertible top as well made as my Mini's.  The ride is exceptional for a small car.  I just love my Mini.  The only negative is my service dealer is 75 miles from where my Mini lives.
mini,cooper,2005,Cressy, 06/17/2006,Awesome,5,"I traded a huge F150 Supercrew 4x4 for my Mini Cooper S and have never regretted it - this car is awesome.  It does 0-60 in the 6's, and gets 30 mpg.  What more can I say!"
mini,cooper,2005,Emma, 07/04/2006,Minitastic,5,I love my Mini.  It is the car that makes you smile every time you get behind the seat.  Any small flaws (there are a few rattles) are by far outweighed by the sheer pleasure of driving this tiny but mighty Mini!
mini,cooper,2005,jhocasio, 07/07/2006,You should get this car....,4,"This car has been fantastic.  Especially when driving in German roads, the car can go up to 141 mph!  The steering is simply superb.  While driving in American roads, the vehicle responds phenomenally to the lack of driving that other's do in the highways.  Its gas mileage - in the highway you can get it up to 30+ miles to the gallon, however, in the city it struggles to keep past 24 mpg -  not bad comparing against the big machines.  Other great things about the vehicle - parking, dual sunroof is a must, storage is actually more than expected.  The challenge - the other challenge is the sport suspension on American roads, our roads just do not support a race car suspension."
mini,cooper,2005,Gina, 08/09/2006,Mini Needs Better Gas Mileage,4,"I have owned this car for about six months. It's fun to drive, has a classy interior, and is loaded with everything and has chrome everywhere. It is easy access to whatever you need. This car has a great panoramic roof!! With a 1.6L 4-cylinder engine it needs to get much better gas mileage though. I have the auto. w/o supercharger and only get about 26 mpg. I would suggest the S model for those who drive on the highway. Getting on and off highway ramps gets a bit tricky. As for the interior room, I've taken 3 coworkers of average size to lunch and they seemed comfortable on the short ride.   I enjoy this car because I'm a 5'3 inch female and it fits me. Getting in and out is easy, and I have a back seat for stuff. I just need to adjust to the lack of power."
mini,cooper,2005,Brian, 03/04/2006,Fun to drive? You better believe it!,5,"This is the first car I've owned in a while (10 years or so of truck ownership preceeded it) and I've always wanted a convertible.  WOW. There are not enough adjectives to describe what it's like to drive this car. From handling corners like they're not even there, to lots of punch in acceleration, you can't help but have a huge grin on your face when you're putting this car through it's paces.  Still, nearly a year after I bought it, I still get people daily asking me about it, if it's fun to drive, where I got it...it's the most fun I've ever had driving a car.  To the editors ratings..7.8? How can you possibly put as much weight into 'cupholders' as you do 'fun to drive'?  "
mini,cooper,2005,COOPER, 03/18/2006,Mini Car - Max Fun,4,This car is a delight!  The only problem that I have had with it was rubbed wiring and it was fixed quickly at the dealer.  We enjoy this car so much. It's velcroed to the road!  It performs perfectly on the interstate at 75 mph or crawling in the city.  I can't wait to see what MINI comes up with next!
mini,cooper,2005,Marvel S, 04/16/2006,Let's Motor,4,"We now have 2 Mini's and love both of them. The Convertible is definitely a head turner. It is lots of fun to drive and totally different from anything on the road today. My 2002 has 30,000 miles and has been very reliable. Between the two cars the only major problem has been with the convertible roof. It is easy to use, but gets white marks on it when raising and lowering. The car has been recalled for this problem. It still does it after the fix. It looks like it can cause early wear.  Besides that one problem, the car has been flawless and just a blast to drive.  Lets Motor!"
mini,cooper,2005,Penny, 05/17/2006,In case you were wondering...,4,"This has been a fun little car with more room than previously anticipated.  For comuters who are willing to forego a smooth ride for great gas mileage or someone who likes to be looked at, this is the car for you.  Personally, I am enjoying this car. I wasn't even interested in buying it because I had an SUV and thought it was to small, I was wrong!  This car is fun and sexy at the same time, who would have thought!  One thing that is confusing, the car has beaucoup gadgets, but is missing standard perks ie; auto tint rearview mirror or digital compass this was standard on a base Saturn. Those items are kind of a no brainer."
mini,cooper,2005,jazz251, 05/28/2006,High Quality Small Car,5,"After years of looking at this car I finally got my wife to test drive it.  Now I can not get her out of it! We bought a 2005 model that was sitting on the lot.  It had only 10,000 miles and had most options.  It is a base engine but the HP seems more than adequate for the traffic bound DC / N. VA area.  Plus the gas mileage is great.  For a small car it is very quiet.  It is well built and fun to drive.  I plan to keep this a long time and plan to pass it on to my son in about 5-6 years. "
mini,cooper,2005,RodgerMcConnell, 06/12/2006,Another Miniac,4,"I love my Mini. I have the Chile Red convertible with white stripes and the car seems to glow. Mine is powered by the JCW engine kit which adds considerable lower end power to the handling equation, and while I've grown a little jaded with the 207 HP power plant, the Mini is an absolute joy to drive. It's quick to accelerate and the precise steering engenders total confidence in the Mini's predictability. All this and the Mini is soooo stylish. I live in Montana and I'm accorded near rock-star adulation while on the road or even when it's parked. While the car is a great social icebreaker, all the attention is almost embarrassing. People of all ages simply love this car!"
mini,cooper,2005,Chris M, 06/23/2006,I love my Go-Cart!,4,"In spite of having the automatic transmission completely replaced and losing some of my faith in my car because of it, I still love driving it. The fuel economy vs. performance can't be matched. This car has a good quality feel but the ride can be a little rough at times. A long trip will leave you feeling fatigued. It is responsive and quick. However, I have had issues with people in huge SUVs not seeing me and almost moving over on me. :) "
mini,cooper,2005,Miss Mini, 07/17/2006,Miss Mini Loves Attention,4,My husband let me pick the car I wanted - and I've always loved the Mini since we were in Europe.  So I was overjoyed when the convertible became available. My husband thought my MINI was a girly car - that is until he drove it. Now he loves to drive it -  the pick-up and the way it holds the road - especially in curves.  He is tall - over 6 ft. and he has plenty of room.  Only draw back is the nearest dealership is 100 miles away.  So am glad it is working well.  
mini,cooper,2005,Hans-Juergen, 08/25/2006,I'm lovin' it !,5,"I've had my Mini for 15 months, and have put 17,000 fun-packed miles on it.  I have the base model with manual transmission, sport seats, and a sunroof.  Although I have read reviews that say otherwise, I think the base model packs plenty of power (as long as the A/C is off).  I have not tired of this car - each time I get in it, I am reminded of how much fun driving should be.  It is responsive on turns, and stable as can be at high speeds on the freeway."
mini,cooper,2005,jrfats, 09/30/2006,'05 Mini,3,"I'm delighted with this Mini. I call it a go cart with air conditioning. I wish that the tires would last longer, but that is a low profile run flat problem. I wish that there were more dealers as I keep the car in Montana - it is over 400 miles to the nearest one.  So far, I have had no problems. The brakes are much better than in the 2003 model, which I still have in another location."
mini,cooper,2005,miniplatz, 10/04/2006,New Owner,4,"I drove it for two days in the West Virginia mountains using the paddel shifter. It was a blast. The only change I would make is an electric adjustable drivers seat. It is a great car, but it is not as much fun as my 1990 British Open Mini.  Everyone should have one."
mini,cooper,2005,MDGiusti, 12/24/2006,I Love My Mini,4,"I love my Mini. I have had it for a little more than two years now and it has treated me very well. My wife and I evacuated from three hurricanes in it (including Katrina and Rita) and its fuel economy and comfort helped us survive the ordeals. We were still driving while less gas-miserly cars had long-since run out of fuel. Evacuations aside, I love driving my little car. It is great fun and I still get envious looks while driving around town. Don't be scared away by size either... I am a 250-pound 6-foot-one man and fit comfortably."
mini,cooper,2005,danderson, 01/05/2007,Great Car,4,This car is with out a doubt the most fun for the money I could ever imagine.
mini,cooper,2005,Sean Maestro, 05/07/2007,Fun Fun Fun,4,"I miss my MINI Cooper. I had a 2005 custom-built to my liking and had it for 2 yrs. I had the opportunity to drive it on English roads and it was perfect for the winding narrow streets and small parking spots. I averaged 29mpg, which I thought was great, giving me about 400 miles per tank. I am 6'3 and was able to fit perfectly, but no one could sit behind me. I had a baby and got rid of it for an SUV - big mistake. "
mini,cooper,2005,Jim, 07/10/2007,Interior bug don't bug me too much,4,I can't say enough about the tight handling in this car. It sticks like glue to the road no matter how hard I push it  It's a feeling of confidence that the car will do what I ask of it. Yes it is plagued with multiple interior bugs but you can't have it all all the time.
mini,cooper,2005,Fuzzyvaldez, 06/28/2007,Best car ever owned,5,"Wow! This is a great car with everything you could want. I've never had any problems with this car and would recommend it to everyone I know. This car has been taken on 1k mile drives and is my daily driver and has never failed me. My only issue is that people didn't order the amenities they really wanted. Please don't complain the car would be better if it had items you didn't order. I've seen this car marked down on the fact it didn't have a sunroof (maybe one should have ordered one) and MPG come on people really, its a sportscar with a supercharger not a hybrid 50hp family wagon. So love this car for what it is and not hate it for what you wish you would have ordered."
mini,cooper,2005,jmargolis, 07/22/2007,Overall not bad,4,"Generally, I've been very happy with my Mini. I've had one ABS sensor go bad and my power steering hose needed replacing for a leak. There are very occasional inexplicable computer problems, as well. Overall, performance and handling are very good, though the stock run-flats on a sport suspension and springs make for a rough ride. The interior is nice (I prefer the pre-2007 interior) but a little ""plasticky""; would be nice if they offered JCW leather upgrade for more than just the dash and down tubes (e.g., the door panels)."
mini,cooper,2005,nkasoff, 10/30/2007,The greatest car I've ever owned,5,"I absolutely love my MINI convertible. I've owned all sorts of cars in the past, and nothing even comes close.  I got a base model, the only option was the CVT. It's not a performance car by any means, but I didn't want that - if I did, I'd have bought the S. I don't need the speed, or the tickets. "
mini,cooper,2005,autooracle, 04/18/2008,"I may be small, but I am safe and solid.",5,Great car. Handles better than a 911.  If that corner says 30 and you are going 60. Hold on!!  Very solid. Rattles can be a bit annoying. The dealer had to intall an anti rattle kit.  So-far-so-good. Get rid of the run flat tires as fast as you can wear them out.  Replacing them with another brand of tire will drastically improve your ride. 
mini,cooper,2005,veridiana andrade, 12/01/2016,l love this vehicle. It's been amazing.,5,"Its a great car when your single.  But now I have kids and it's too small for everything I have to carry.
"
mini,cooper,2005,MJ, 01/09/2018,Love my MINI,5,"Great Car!. Fun to drive.  Fuel efficient.  More interior room than you'd think.

mini,cooper,2005,Montgomery Alphetia, 02/27/2005,This car is rubbish,1,Do not buy this car. it is a rip-off and a cheat. The exhuast pipe fell off only one day after i bought it brand new.
mini,cooper,2005,7670226, 06/28/2008,7670226,4,"We dumped our Jetta for a Mini, and it was a great decision. It feels so exhilirating to ride. The vroom of the 1.6-liter four makes me want to go faster. The transmission, though is a different story. But there is so little body lean, it corners perfectly, why get an S model if this is enough? The rear seat is surprisingly roomy for a car this small. Most controls are simple to use. The outside is just adorable. The white goes perfectly with the black roof. Driving lamps help at night. It's sad that there isn't enough room for us and our luggage, so we can't go to Chicago with it. But it's so much fun just to drive through the city. It's so playful."
mini,cooper,2005,Peeweee, 09/16/2008,The most fun car to drive,5,"Finally kids are grown - no hockey bags to haul or kids to move to college. This little car is so road hugging and is so responsive - it is just the most fun I've had in 35 years of driving. Not a day goes by that someone doesn't stop me and ask ""what is that car?"" or ""do you like it?"" This little car gets me high fives when driving down the highway and many smiles at his license plate (PeeWeee). A great brotherhood (or sisterhood) as I get waves from other mini drivers. Often I come out of the mall or grocery store and find another mini parked right next to me. Love to surprise large men who think they will be cramped inside the car. Wonderful little car I will have for years!"
mini,cooper,2005,da libby, 04/28/2005,Fun Factor+++,5,"Once you get past the ordering and waiting process, which MINI had made kind of fun in its own way, the real fun comes in driving it.  Easy to drive and park in the city and great to drive on the highway.  Best though is driving on twisty ""country"" roads.  Great handling and a very solid ride -- no twist and shake like in other convertibles I've driven.  The sport seats are very comfortable, even after a 5-hour cross-state drive.  Contrary to the ""official"" review, the HP in the base Cooper is plenty for getting to highway speeds smoothly and effortlessly -- watch the speedo because you won't realize how quickly you can pass the speed limit!"
mini,cooper,2005,Jack Nesbitt, 06/10/2005,Red Mini,4,"Coming up on 10,000 miles. No major problems of any type. Rides hard as one would expect. Small noise in dashboard when on bad LA freeways. Gets great mileage. Averaging 31.7 mpg in LA combined highway and city.  "
mini,cooper,2005,Ted, 03/18/2006,Makes me feel young.,4,My 2005 MINI Cooper S Convertible is my weekend car.  It is extremely fun to drive.  I park my SUV in the driveway after work and just take off with my MINI.  It is a throw back to my younger days.  
mini,cooper,2005,Drew, 05/17/2005,05 JCW MINI Cooper S,4,The MINI Cooper and all its different models are great and are totally an expression of the owner's personality. Love how customizeable it is.  The handling and acceleration on the S is awesome. Totally a fun car to drive around in & turns heads.
mini,cooper,2005,Britishdave, 01/03/2005,"One word, ""FUN Fun Fun""",5,"One drive of this car and you know 
right away what all the fuss is about. 
It truely is that good!

Thanks to European gear ratios and go-
kart cornering, mine has had fun 
staying up with some expensive metal on 
the  mountain roads this summer. 

If you know anything about MINI Cooper 
history, you know that in years to come 
many of these cars will be tore apart 
and rebuilt into 300hp plus pocket 
rockets. They already have 250-280hp 
aftermarket tuning kits available. Can 
you imagine?

Great mileage, awesome low depreciation 
values, complete standard features all 
adds up to a fun car that loves to be 
driven at a fraction of the cost of 
competing toys."

mini,cooper,2005,Jim, 01/29/2005,MINI Cooper S,5,"After 18000 miles, there is little I would change about the MINI Cooper S. Performance is excellent in all aspects and the MCS is a blast to drive.  You can't help but have a broad smile after a drive.  Overall mileage rarely drops under 30 mpg. One weak point is tire wear.  The front tires of my first set of Dunlop all weathers was ready for replacement at 16000 miles. With the standard suspension, the ride is firm but not jarring. Controls, though uniquely placed, are easy to learn and sensible. Of some fifty cars I've owned, the MCS sits at the top of my fun to drive list!"
mini,cooper,2005,ROGER, 02/11/2005,More fun than...,5,"This is the most fun I've had driving since my 70 Pontiac Trans-am. My Mini has several after-market additions and is an absolute delight. You just want to get in and drive. And WOW, what a ride it is. I'm a big guy and was put off by the size till I climbed in and drove the car. It's roomy, comfortable and offers excellent driver visibility. Mine has dual moon roofs and tinted glass all the way around--highly recommend that trick. The roadability is superb. Get the S- model with a 6-speed Getrag and you're in for a real thrill. This car wants to go 70 mph so you'll want to watch the foot because 70 in this car is like 50 in another car. Go for it!!!"

mini,cooper,2005,CyKy0205, 02/15/2005,2005 Mini Cooper S,4,This car is fun to drive and own.  Trying to keep it within the speed limit is difficult.  I purchased a radar detector before I filled the tank for the first time.  The only downside was getting the run-flat tire repaired after I picked up a nail on the street.
mini,cooper,2005,fgdrewry, 02/15/2005,Cooper S,5,"Althought this car is less than a month old,  I traded in a Hatchback Cooper S with 30,000 miles that I purchased 3 years ago.  My evaluation would be the same for the MINI I traded except for performance.  My new car has the John Cooper Works kit which boosts the horse power from about 167 to 207.  This makes the car really get up and go.  I have had numerous sports cars over the years--Maserati, Porsche, Corvette, etc. and this handles as well as any of them."
mini,cooper,2005,R Page, 02/18/2005,Fun with a Mini,4,"Find this car to be the most fun and exciting. Owned a Porsche 911SC for 20 years and the Mini is just a joy and a kick to drive. Handling, gearbox and acceleration are superb. 4,000 miles and not a rattle or even one minor problem. "
mini,cooper,2005,Larry, 02/26/2005,Worth it,4,I love to be in it and drive it.  I know many people who have very expensive cars that prefer the mini as there regular car. It handles in traffic and can move into parking and tough spot easily...City traffic is a breeze. It hanles great in the Canyons of Los Angeles.......And it is a looker.

The car is Fast, Fun, SAFE & does not depreciate like other cars...Why would it? I paid MSRP, and so did everyone else! It is a limited production car unlike Toyota, Nissan, Honda & the others... (I'll never owe more than the car is worth.).  The Sales staff at my dealer (Checkered Flag) are simply the most well trained & educated crew I've ever dealt with. Other dealers should take a lesson! This is the way to sell & service the customer.  If you have not driven a MINI ""S"" yet you need to, its everything you would expect BMW to manufacture!!!  Quality!!!  "

Unfortunatly, she gets sick A LOT!  I am the second owner of this car.  Since I purchased it last June, the clutch has been replaced twice, the transmission has been replaced once, the computer has been replaced about four times, airbags have been replaced twice, and speakers have been replaced twice.  She is currently in need of new brakes, a new windshield, a new speaker, I have a feeling the clutch is going again, and since the air bag light is on for about the 100th time again, she probably needs either another new computer or new air bags.  I don't blame the car, I blame the HORRIBLE service dept. of BMW"

mini,cooper,2005,lee, 04/09/2005,Great Car For The Money,4,"The Mini Cooper is the best value for the most car on the market. We chose the basic model, since the prospect of two 50-year-old women going 140 miles per hour in Boca Raton, Fl, seemed a wee bit silly.  What we found was a car with all the safety features of BMW and a length to width ratio that makes the car stick to the road like a fly to a glue strip. Then there is the great gas milage, exceptional sound system, stylish good looks and a real backseat. We are in heaven.  I highly recommended this car for anyone who wants a sporty convertible for safe, fun, ""normal"" driving. If you want to race, go spend four-to-five times the money. "
mini,cooper,2005,archrail, 04/12/2005,Enjoyable,5,"I am really enjoying the car. My other car is a 1971 Porsch 914-4.  Both cars are excellant. But the MINI Cooper of course is techincally superior. After all, there should be advances in 34 years of motoring. But the Porsche is still fun to drive, however the MINI actually handles better. Both have 1.6 liter engines. The engine response with the MINI is quicker and you can really control the MINI on a mountain road. You drive has hard and as fast as you, the driver can handle!"

I've never owned a better car, (since 1964 I've had everything from VW convertibles to a 280SL Mercedes), and I've never been happier with a vehicle.  My '05 Mini S convertible is fast, corners  well, and looks great.  If you want to meet people, this car is a real conversation starter, because a day doesn't go by without someone asking, ""How do you like your Mini?""  The bottom line?  I love it!"
mini,cooper,2005,kroth5, 04/18/2005,"Great car, inside and out",5,"I bought the car for its looks, but I am very pleased with its performance and interior. MINI is a great company and the service group in Orlando is wonderful.  Also, they make owning the car fun, with a great merchandise catalog and some great giveaways like travel games, MINI playing cards, etc.  "
mini,cooper,2005,sizedsmatr, 04/28/2005,I love this car,4,"This car is the most fun little thing to drive.    I am amazed at the handling and power for such a small engine.  I also have a 745Li, but I love zipping around town in my Mini."
mini,cooper,2005,etemchin, 05/01/2005,Great Mini,5,The mini Cooper is a great car to own.  it is really fun to drive and gets pretty good gas mileage.  I really recomend checking it out.
mini,cooper,2005,Hap Bullard, 05/01/2005,One fun car,4,"Fun to drive with plenty of performance. Other than having to replace the drivers side window regulator our Mini has performed perfectley. Very comfortable and stable  at 90 to 100 MPH, and still gets 25 plus miles per gallon. Great in traffic, with the 6 speed gear box you can match RPM's at any speed for a good ride. The traction control is a waste and can be dangrous if you forget to turn it off especially under hard braking or when you put some lateral G's on her. This is the best new car I've bought for the price, ever.  If you want a car that really makes you smile,buy a Mini..."
mini,cooper,2005,Angie Zemzicki, 05/02/2005,"My Li'l Mini Cooper ""S""",5,"This is the car for adventurous folks.  Not a family (not enough space for passengers in back seat). Great gas mileage, especially with today's prices at the pump. Handles like a fancy high priced sports car.  "
mini,cooper,2005,Gwen, 05/12/2005,Gwenie,5,What a wonderful and dependable car. I have owned many vehicles and swore off small cars until my cooper was given to me. I have 8 children so we plan on having 9 Mini's parked in our driveway with the next 9 years. Thanks for a wonderful adventure in life!
mini,cooper,2005,subductiveevilsoulII, 05/04/2005,Joe's response,5,"the car is very nice, and it handles like a car should.  it is very easy going on the fuel, and it has the pick up and go that you need to have to drive defensively"
mini,cooper,2005,Sharon Banis, 05/13/2005,Mini Cooper Coupe/Hatchback 2005,4,"It's a joy to drive. It's a conversation starter. I get ""flashes"" from other Mini owners -- like a secret handshake. Everyone wants to go for a ride in the Mini (well nearly everyone)! It causes smiles! It handles well and is fairly sturdy -- unfortunately Mina was hit by an Accord and had some ""internal injuries"" but the Accord lost its bumper and Mina looks like new after some repairs! I remained unhurt.  It hugs curves and feels very stable."
mini,cooper,2005,ilovemymini, 05/27/2005,lets motor,5,i have never been so happy with a car purchase. I love my mini cooper and cannot wait to purchase the redesigned and improved version in 2007. i recommend this car to everyone looking to have a great time and turn some heads.
mini,cooper,2005,Tykoon, 05/27/2005,Awesome Car,4,Talk about an awesome car.  I've had it just over a month...& I absolutely love it.  Fun to drive and look at.  Its a real attention getter.  I'm not worried about the reliability it has a warranty and it is a bmw.  More than that It is just the most wonderful car.  Its my first new car and I love it.
mini,cooper,2005,HOTCOLE, 05/28/2005,COLE'S REVIEW,5,Fast and fun - excellent Sunday car!
mini,cooper,2005,kitty, 05/28/2005,Kitty's Mini Cooper,5,Ordered mini Cooper ........took 45 days to recieve...........Outstanding car. Comfortable.....Head Turner !!
mini,cooper,2005,Bob Bellamy, 05/28/2005,Not So Mini!!!,4,"What a car!!! If you've never driven one, you don't know what you're missing!!! Not enough u's in the word FUN!!!"
mini,cooper,2005,Leslie, 05/28/2005,Fun things in small packages.,4,"This car has been great fun and I get plenty of looks!  It is easy to drive and easy on the gas.  It's relatively quiet, for a convertible, and grips the road when it corners.  The ride is a bit rough but it's worth it.  The electric sun roof/top are fast and easy to operate.  "
mini,cooper,2005,vonhanep, 05/28/2005,MINI Mania,4,"Without a doubt the most fun car I have ever driven.  It still brings a smile to my face whenever I open the garage on my way to work in the morning.  The one-button convertible top operation, which opens and closed the windows as well as the top is an engineering feat."
mini,cooper,2005,Joe Obermeier, 05/28/2005,"I call it Lucille, it's a ball to drive",4,"Had an original Mini in 1968. Ordered a new 2002 as soon as deposites were taken. Had the second all yellow one in South Florida. The dealer had the first. Put 23,500 mile on in and traded it in on a 2005 MINI Cooper S convertable. The perfect car for South Florida. Go topless most of the time. Fast enough to avoid most rain drops and getting too wet inside. "
mini,cooper,2005,Roger W Perman, 05/28/2005,2002 Mini,5,"I purchased this vehicle new and use it mainly to run around town in. I have in it for service one time with no major problems. The only problem I have ever had was the rear hatch had a problem staying closed. They fixed it.A great car, a great price, I would certainly purchase another one."
mini,cooper,2005,Meg Duarte, 05/29/2005,My yellow MINI,4,"This is my third Mini - drove two in Europe - I just love, my clients love it, and even my very tall friends are comfortable and get a kick out of it.  I will NEVER change brands.  There are a few problems, but all are curable.  I've driven lots of different brands since I began to drive in 1956 and the MINI is #1"
mini,cooper,2005,WindInMyHair, 05/31/2005,"Oh yeah, Baby!",4,"Driving shouldn't be this much fun.  Corners are the best... on my test drive I was actually INSTRUCTED to floor it on tight turns and bumps and it performed great.  Awesome gas mileage, one touch convertible top operation.  Smooth ride even at high speeds.  My only complaint is the cup holders...."
mini,cooper,2005,C Dodge, 05/31/2005,Love the MINI Cooper Convertible,4,The interior of the MINI Cooper convertible is much larger than it appears if you are outside the car.  Leg room in the rear seats is limited (but that's not a problem for me).  The car is very responsive and a lot of fun to drive.  I have the basic model but I find that the horsepower is more than adequate for my driving.  And I love the overall look of the car.
mini,cooper,2005,dogswood, 05/31/2005,A Boomer's Car,4,"This is the car for baby boomers over 6 feet tall. At 6'5"", I can stretch out and enjoy the top down 12 months of the year (seat warmers). Mandatory to spend extra $300-$400 for wind deflector to keep wind off your back.  Comfortable for long trips but no room behind tall drivers. Really a 3 seat car. Also, minimal trunk although back seats fold down.  Glad I got S version, motor is enough to leave all but the very serious roadster behind.  No serious complaint. However, orange odometer and trip computer very difficult to read in daylight.  A great handling and fun to drive ""hot rod""!!!"
mini,cooper,2005,T. Smith, 06/02/2005,Fun and Affordable,4,"This has been a great driving year. I love my MINI. One of the great things about it is the smiles that are invariably produced when you drive by. Gas mileage is acceptable (though high test gas is a slight burden).  The interior is very comfortable (definitely spring for the leather sport seats). My son (a tall 9 year old) has plenty of room in the back and the three of us have taken several long trips. Having a MINI means packing lightly, but it's a good exercise in downsizing the extraneous stuff that crowds our lives. Pleny of room for groceries and such and tall people fit fine. But the real sell is the enjoyment of driving. Go-kart? Maybe. But it's stable and, did I mention fun?"
mini,cooper,2005,jon walke, 06/10/2005,mini cooper aka bmw garbage,3,"owned the car for 6 months,it was in the shop 8 times for problem with car almost stalling when air was on,bmw acknowledged there was a problem & didnt have any time when expected to have remedy,also had power steering replaced & the car had more rattles than a 1980's huyndai - bmw doesnt participate in the california arbitration for lemon law so traded it in on a new vw bettle before everyone figured out what a piece of crap the cars are.thank goodness they have a 3yr 36k mile warranty, you'll need it "
mini,cooper,2005,jc vol, 06/10/2005,coopsoso,4,Performance it good. Fueling its great and the best car for parking!! I just love it. lol
mini,cooper,2005,SPT, 06/10/2005,Mini Car Maxi Fun,4,One of the best cars I have owned. Perfect for a city ... easy to park.  Three issues:  1) Needs decent back bumper 2) poor visibility with top up and down 3) rough ride. This IS a sportscar not a sedan.
mini,cooper,2005,deb, 06/10/2005,New Cooper,4,"Fun to drive, fun to own"
mini,cooper,2005,Handy Andy, 06/13/2005,Seniors love Mini!,5,"Our Mini has been a wonderful car.  It fits everything that we need to put in it.  It is FUN to drive, and we get alot of comments from people who want to know how we like it.  Even though we live 125 miles away from the dealer, it is not a problem because the Mini only needs to be serviced once a year  Many of our friends and relatives have driven the car and all of them love it.  There is alot of room in the front seats.  Following the production of car on the internet was great fun."
mini,cooper,2005,conmike92, 06/15/2005,Mini Mania,5,"Its a great car...you do not need the S engine for extra power.  The standard engine is great.  CUTE, CUTE, CUTE (and fun!) car!!"
mini,cooper,2005,pedro fonseca, 06/23/2005,my toy,5,"I love my little car, i am 70 years old and I feel very confortable driven my mini, the power is more than enoug, already  drive to Tampa at 70 and 80 miles per hour and run beautifull, stability is great and brake excelent, I just trade a BMW 330 convertible and i have more fun with my mini, every body look at the car and ask question. I wish if can running with regular gas but they recomended high grade that is expensive."
mini,cooper,2005,emily!, 07/07/2005,Perhaps the Best Car Ever Made,5,"The 2005 Mini Cooper Convertible is not only cute, and fuel efficiant, but also well designed in the ways of aesthetics and performance alike. I can corner in my Mini at 70mph without a peep from the tyres, the convertible top lifts up in the back so even more stuff can be crammed in the trunk.The convertible top can either be opened all the way, or be opened part-way and used as a sunroof! The interior is fun, and roomy, allowing my 6'2"" boyfriend to comfortably stretch out, while i, at 5'1"" have no problem reaching everything. In addition to all of this, the Mini is small enough to create it's own parking places, where SUV's would'nt dare to go! By far the BEST CAR EVER MADE!!! "
mini,cooper,2005,Mark Smith, 06/29/2005,The best small car in the U.S.!,5,"The MINI for me is the only car that truly excells in the categories of Style, Performance, Fun to drive, and practicality. It's great on fuel economy (29mpg avg. Cooper S manual), comes with three years of free maintenance (even covers brakes), has go kart performance, and is able to fit all of the people and cargo that I ever need. There's nothing negative I can say about the vehicle. It does everything I ask it to do above and beyond the call of duty. Why would you consider any other small vehicle? "
mini,cooper,2005,MiniSuz, 07/10/2005,Love My MINI,5,"It's only been six months, but the love affair continues between me and my MINI!  I've never had such fun owning and driving a car!"
mini,cooper,2005,Linda, 07/10/2005,The Mini is a Hoot,4,"The Mini is a ""big car in a little body.""  It has plenty of power on the highway, gets great gas mileage, and is just plain fun to drive.  The only negative thing about it is that it uses a higher grade of gasoline than most."
mini,cooper,2005,Shutt, 07/10/2005,Awesome,5,"My 2005 Mini Cooper Ragtop is great. From its performance to its looks, there wasnt another car on the road so well packed for the money."
mini,cooper,2005,m,inimini,Super fun car,5,"Normally drive a BMW X5 and will still use it when taking out clients. Drive about 75 miles a day and this mini convertable is a gas. The 5 speed manual is perfectly syncronized and the automatic top, which can also be used as a sunroof, is one touch Am already getting over 30mpg in the city and 40 on the highways....but most of all, it's FUN"
mini,cooper,2005,Newton, 07/11/2005,MINI Cooper Convertible Rocks!,5,"I waited 3 months for my 2005 MINI Cooper S Cabrio and it was worth the wait!!! I have not been disapointed.  In fact, I've been grinning like the Cheshire cat for the past two weeks.  Every day I have been approached by someone commenting on it:  ""Classiest Cooper I've ever seen!"" ""Way Too Cool, Thumbs UP!""  ""What is it?"" ""I WANT YOUR CAR, REALLY BAD!"" ""Hey! You're driving my car!"" ""Love your car!"" I feel like a celebrity, may have to get a press agent if the attention keeps coming! The fun factor in the MINI is way off the chart! But in the end it is also a well-built solid car with great safety features and way better fuel economy than my hubby's SUV. You don't just drive it, you wear it!"
mini,cooper,2005,JCRAY49, 07/21/2005,Great Car....but...Service is a Concern,4,"Initially, I purchased the Mini Cooper S because of my wife and daughter's infatuation with this car.  After driving this vehicle only one time, I also became ""hooked"".  My main concern about purchasing this vehicle was the lack of dealer certified service in my area.  Unfortunately, my fears became reality just 3 weeks after purchasing our new 2005 Mini.  Our sun/moonroof motor went out after only 1,200 miles on the car.  I spent a day traveling to get this car repaired under warranty.  I am hoping for the best from here on out. The car is truly very fun to drive and actually fits our family of 4.  I am 6'4"" and the car fits me fine.  We all have a great time taking rides in our Mini."
mini,cooper,2005,pcphil, 07/21/2005,Most fun ever driven,5,"This car makes me smile just thinking about driving it. It is surprisingly roomy even for large people. It drives like it is on rails. Room for two plus their luggage. Able to carry two more for short jaunts, but would not want to carry 4 on a road trip."
mini,cooper,2005,David, 07/26/2005,Flawless -- so far,4,"I find it odd how some people claim to have such bad experiences with car. I think they are the ones who write reviews, and the others (the vast majority) are out driving.  I'm in the latter category.  I have had not one single breakdown, broken anything, or even a rattle develop in 6 months/7,000 miles of driving it.  In fact, I can't believe I've already put 7,000 miles on it.  I had one defect from the get-go, but it's so minor, it's hardly worth mentioning: the driver's-side door handle's LED seems to have omitted at the factory (the passenger-side one is present).  Oh the horror!  I can recommend this car without qualification as one with the best build, quality, fun and value out there."
mini,cooper,2005,Ed, 08/12/2005,A blast to drive,5,"I test drove a 2004 MINI for the first time, just for kicks - when I accidentally took a corner at 45 mph, I was hooked. The '05 model has more horses, some better styling, and even more options. I picked up an S (chili red, white roof and mirrors) with Premium, Sports, and Cold Weather packages (for use in Chicago), and the Harmon Kardon sound system. Short version: I love it. Handling is great; acceleration, while not the best, is plenty of fun for a daily driver. The size and maneuverability make the MINI perfect for parallel parking and highway passing. My only major worry is that somebody will drive into me while smiling at my car!"
mini,cooper,2005,Cool Blue, 08/16/2005,I like it,4,"This car has replaced my motorcycle as my fun vehicle. While it's small, at least I can take my wife and kids with me for a ride now. The retro/modern styling makes the car truly unique and the supercharger's whine combined with the deep exhaust note are heavenly on your ears. Lot's of customization options from the dealer and third parties. "
mini,cooper,2005,DeeDubya, 08/16/2005,Fun? Yes...but aphathetic service...,3,"I wanted a vehicle that was fun to drive and good on gas.  The MINI S has delivered on those counts.  But, the engine has developed a cold start stumble and nearly stalled in traffic the other day.  BMW calls it a ""low idle problem"".  The service department has ""made a note of my concern"", but would not look at the car.  I've owned it 7 months, but I'm looking for another vehicle.  One needs a thick skin at BMW/MINI Service departments.  Sales departments are all sweetness and light, but the real truth can be found at service.  Wait for the 2007 engine redesign if you want this car."
mini,cooper,2005,MINIZ, 08/17/2005,MINI's: THe New Milenium,4,"This car is not only fuel efficent, it's fun to drive. I drive my kids around and they are extremely comfortable. It's got power and speed; it makes you want to keep driving! I recommned this car for anyone who is looking for a safe, reliable, fun and cute car to drive! Let's motor!"
mini,cooper,2005,tbong, 08/29/2005,Fun Car to Drive When You Can,3,Owned for three months and it has been in the shop three times.  With problems ranging from the car not starting to the GPS not working.  Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.
mini,cooper,2005,Matt, 09/14/2005,Lots of fun,4,"I've owned this vehicle for about two months now.  Overall I've had a very satisfying experience.  Despite the rising price of gas (and the fact that you fill up with premium) I can't get enough of driving this car.  I did have some minor issues with the car, the first was that the door latch on the driver's side did not want to open correctly, a tension issue that was quickly fixed by the dealer.  The second was a defective ignitor of one of my xenon headlights, again fixed for me under warranty."
mini,cooper,2005,SteveK, 09/21/2005,Mini Cooper S..Maximum Fun!,4,"Nov '04 I went to Moritz BMW to test drive a 3-series.  Saw the Mini dealer next door and did a test drive.  That's all it took! 10 months and 7400 miles later...it's GREAT!  With the youngest out of the house, it's just my wife and I.  Even did a Mini road rally this past Labor Day weekend in TX hill country.  Those backroads were built for this car!!"
mini,cooper,2005,GEORGE, 09/23/2005,Awesome MINI,5,"This car is a crowd stopper! Anywhere you go, people are in awe over it.  It is great now that I pass by the pumps when everyone is in line for $3 gas."
mini,cooper,2005,Jeff, 10/24/2005,AMAZING,4,"My Mini cost me about $21,000 with tax, title, ect. and I would have paid $50,000. This car has more value and performance than most would belive possible for it's price range. It is easily comprable to more expenisive veichles and without question more stylish. A++ RECOMENDED FOR ALL!~"
mini,cooper,2005,Laurence Ewing, 10/25/2005,Spunky Little Car,4,"This car is a fun car and now with the price of gasoline, it is an economical car to drive.  I am very happy with the way it handles, especially on curves.  I really don't think the car can be rolled.  It is a little rough riding, but I think that is mainly due to the ""run flat tires"" on my car.  I like how the door windows seal themselves, which reduces wind noise.  The car is easy to clean and care for.  It is suprising how much one can place in the back; even more if the rear seats folded down.  It is a great car!"
mini,cooper,2005,JennyK325, 10/27/2005,I get MINI withdrawal ....,5,"I bought my car used.  It needed a tire speed sensor installed at 18,000 miles. Since then, it has been great.  The first owner did not treat the car kindly.  Other MINI owners wave or honk every time they pass.  I look forward to driving my car.  It's fun to take out on curvy roads, similar to driving a comfortable go-cart.  I did have one passenger too large to fit in the car, but otherwise it's big enough for everything else -- grocery shopping is not a problem, nor is transporting 3 teenage boys!  The hatch lid hides whatever is in there providing extra security."
mini,cooper,2005,Sun195, 12/27/2005,"Fun to drive, needs better build quality",3,"We've had a 5-speed MINI Cooper for about a year. It's a lot of fun to drive around town and twisty roads, but not very comfortable on long trips. The gas milage has been ""ok"", but not great. The build quality is seriously lacking - wheel center caps fell off, rattles all over the interior, problems getting car into reverse. If you buy one of these, make sure your dealer provides good service -  our local dealer has been difficult to work with and they are only dealer in state. We had better luck driving out of state for service, which needless to say is not very convenient. I expected much better service and build quality from a subsidary of BMW."
mini,cooper,2005,nick, 12/27/2005,Best Litle Car I have Ever Seen,4,"I've had my MINI Cooper for 9 months and it the best car I have ever driven.  I always get looks, get stoped, and get compliments on it.  People are always asking ""Where did you get it and how much it cost?""  When I tell them, I can see that I have made a new Mini owner."
mini,cooper,2005,Da-Works, 01/04/2006,Boxster Killer,4,"I purchased my Pepper White John Cooper Works MINI S last May and Ive had a permagrin ever sense.  The performance is almost scary and surprising to many who try to follow me on a back road. If you're thinking of buying a MINI, do it. It's more than just another sports car.  The build quality is excellent and, so far, the reliability has been great. I bought my car with several features that the autocrosser would think of ordering. Full sunroof, upgraded seats and auto ac/heat, as well as auto headlights dimming rear view mirror, etc. Overall the added features make the car a great cruiser and weekend get-away car. "
mini,cooper,2005,sojurn79, 01/10/2006,I Love My Mini,5,"My 2005 MINI Cooper is truly a fantastic car with so many options available that you get a completely customizable ride straight from the factory.  I recommend this car to anyone who has to commute far, for in-town driving, or for someone who just wants a nice economical show-piece in your driveway.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
mini,cooper,2005,Sam Mannos, 04/07/2006,Sam's Mini Cooper,5,"This vehicle is the best small auto I have ever owned. As soon as a 4 door model is available, we will be shopping for a second Mini Cooper for our family. This automobile is comfortable, fun to drive, very responsive and has power to spare."

Jaguar xke, a 1971 jaguar xj6 and 
several cadillacs. I find that the Mini 
is by far the most fun car to drive. 
It's like driving a go-kart, Which I 
have also owned. The confort is not the 
qualty of the cadillac but then how 
many cars are."
mini,cooper,2005,Rick Bounds, 09/02/2004,Fortunate and Fun,4,"I've really enjoyed the car.  There have been a few 
rattles which have been fixed by the dealership.  
There have also been a few strange noises coming 
from the clutch when the car hasn't been driven in 
several days at start-up.  At times when it is hot, it 
idles rough.  I love the car, but I'm not too 
convinced that maintenance will not skyrocket as 
the car gets older.  The strange noises coming from 
the clutch have me worried.  All in all, I'm still glad I 
bought it."
mini,cooper,2005,Michael Button, 09/17/2004,My mini....NOT so good!,3,"My Mini has been in the shop more times 
than I can count! I have had problems 
with the computer since day 1! I have 
had many things replaced and it's only 
6 months old! I DO NOT recommend buying 
a MINI at all! My dealership has been 
great but the car....SUCKS! My locks 
have a mind of their own! It is in the 
shop as we speak waiting to see if it 
will be purchased back under the 
Oklahoma Lemon Law!"
mini,cooper,2005,swisso, 09/24/2004,Awesome Fun,5,"Just purchased a new convertible Cooper 
S. I test drove the following 
convertibles: BMW 3, Jeep, Audi and 
mini. Having owned two BMW's in the 
past there is no question that BMW has 
graced this car with German 
engineering. This was unquestionably 
the most fun to drive and put an ear-to-
ear smile on my face from day one. 
Looking out the back can be a bit of a 
problem at first but once you get used 
to the size its fine. I've cruised at 
90mph with the top down and that is no 
problem also. Just like the reviwers 
said: ""this is a go-cart for adults"". 
If you really enjoy feeling the road 
while driving and you don't need a lot 
of space this is it."

A Mini Cooper, while accessible to everyone, is very much a sports car and souls be treated and maintained as such. I bought mine used and while I love it, I poured a good amount of money into it on repairs because the previous owner didn't take care to buy original parts, perform regular oil changes, or just maintenance in general.

mini,cooper,2006,z31526@gmail.com, 06/10/2016,Mini Cooper S *Yes or No*,4,"First I might say I loved this car. Second thing is I was scared to drive it. Scared that something might break. There are things you need to know. I have been a diy mechanic for many many years. This is not your average car to maintain. This was a super clean car when I bought it and traded it in. I had this for a year 58,000 miles to 66,000. I did the following things to the car. Tires - Most of these cars require run flat tires, because there is no spare! This will cost you more. O2 Sensors if you do not know what this is DO NOT BUY THIS CAR! 2 of them and 80.00 a pop. Brakes 140.00, Water outlet gasket just the gasket if you can find it 16.00. Plug wire and plugs 120.00. I was a fool for buying this fun car and even dumber to put money into it. What they don't tell you is the added expense if you do not run premium gas. You will eat O2 sensors up all the time. Clutch

1. Don't loose the keys this will be spendy
2. Repairs - You better have money a clutch is upwards of 1800.00
3. Only a mini dealer can clear some of the codes this will cost you.
4. If you have snow beware the car might be able to do it but take a look under the car there is a cooling fan that sucks up from the bottom of the car to cool the engine. Snow will ice up and bam ur back at that mini dealer again.

There are so many things im sure I have forgotten. This was not the car for me or my family. She was a ton of fun but not that much fun had it up to 140 and was scared. Took corners at 60 and wow was cool. Then I realized mmmmm im Married and 42 years old.

So I leave it up to you. They say this was the most dependable year to have. Stay away from automatics just read the blogs. Took this car on a 1600 mile round trip and that was enough for me to get rid of it. Tale care!

mini,cooper,2006,Lydia, 01/01/2016,Worst Car Ever,1,"Owning this car is like dating a hotshot model. Sure, the first few dates are amazing because, hey, you're dating a super hot chick and everyone thinks you're a stud. However, after a few dates you start to realize that your wallet has run dry because the relationship is so expensive! Dinners at 5 star restaurants, fancy vacations, frequent shopping days, expensive gifts... you get the picture.

Moral of the story, DO NOT buy this car unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in repairs. 

It is cheaply made however the parts are expensive, oil changes are expensive and hard to find ($80+ per change), repairs are expensive, and finding mechanics to work on it is very difficult. I bought this used and gorgeous, with only 70k, but within a year after purchase the power steering failed ($1000), the coolant reservoir cracked open ($500), the engine mounts broke ($1000), numerous leaks and other engine problems ($5000), electrical units failed and now it thinks the trunk is always open and the tires are always low. I cannot WAIT to BREAK UP with this car! Looks aren't everything and I need a car that I can trust.

Again, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS CAR unless you're willing to throw money at it year after year.

The 2002-2004 models are just as fun but not as easy to live with.
The MINI is a car that you buy if you love driving; it simply puts a smile on your face every time you get in it, even the non-S models.
I particularly like the cheeky British styling altho not everyone does.
It was tied for highest resale value (w/Honda Civic) for compacts!
If reliability, interior space or a quiet ride (MINIs have lots of interior squeaks/rattles) are at the top of your shopping this, this probably isn't the car for you."

Unusual instrumentation with smaller speedo and tach mounted side by side on steering wheel. Love driving the car. It's almost as fun to drive as a Porsche 911 I had. Supercharged engine has plenty of power. Handling is very good, although ride is more unforgiving than the Porsche due to the run flat tires. If you don't know, minis don't come with a spare tire, thus the run flats. Repairs that I had to deal with include a leak around the thermostat (twice), a leaky hydraulic motor mount, a minor oil leak, and a faulty passenger airbag sensor that required replacing the passenger seat cover ($1200, but covered by warranty)."
mini,cooper,2006,Barry Whitman, 01/05/2017,Old Guy with Old Mini,5,"This car has the unlikely distinction of having very successfully replaced a Lexus sedan.  It is a poor man's Porsche (I've owned a couple of Turbo Porsches in my time), with excellent tracking, braking and performance.  Its ride is on the stiff side, due to its extra springs and run-flat tires, but perfectly acceptable because of its performance.  It is happiest at 70+ on the Interstate, but does just fine around town.  The mileage is almost always in the 30's, but bear in mind that it prefers premium fuel.  If I were buying today, I'd add a Sirius radio (for station variety) and navigation, but I would not change much else.

The mini emblem on the steering wheel popped off when I pressed the horn. The windows and sunroof sometimes open when I unlock the car using the electronic fob.

It is a small car that makes it fun and easy to find parking spaces. It does have some blind spots, but with time you learn how to adjust to this and the sensors help when backing up.  I took mine on an eight hour road trip and the car was very comfortable.  I was able to fit a large suite case in the back with the seats down.

It makes driving everything else feel like you're in a 1970s Toyota!  The transmission was a little laggy, but I dealt with it.  In all honesty the worst part about the car was that the key had such a bad range, other than that, I couldn't complain.  I sold it to a nice family for the same price I bought it for (2years later) and I was going to buy a Prius for the MPGs.  Well, a Prius is not a fun car.  I'm currently looking for another Mini Cooper, because after driving a street-legal go-kart, it's hard to switch to an average car!

This is perhaps the most fun car per dollar spent you can own. The Bad: it needs planned maintenance every 40k miles. In my case the suspension components including the various rubber bushings and the shock absorbers need replacing. The supercharger service (adding new oil) is expensive (almost all is labor and approx. $1,000) and this should be done around 80k. I had one rusty door, replaced under the 12 year rust warranty.

After all is said and done, the MINI was a great car to drive. Even the convertible is faster than most cars on the road. It's easy to play leap frog in traffic with this little go-kart. Too bad they went to turbo, because hearing the whine of the supercharger was very comforting. I will miss the MINI, but not its potential for high maintenance costs and the small cargo area. "

One of the issues here is the passenger seat air bag sensor cycles on and off. If God forbid we are in accident an the air bags don't deploy someone could die!  Look else where!"
mini,cooper,2006,Limycar, 10/20/2006,"MINI Car, Major Problems",3,"I wish that my ex-car was as reliable as the dealer I purchased it from.  In 10 months, the car was in the shop 30+ days for the same problem four times...loss of power as a result of misfiring.  The sensor lights such as the DSC came on without reason and the digital gauge for average gas consumption continued to read 99.9 even at a stand still.  The central lock sporadically unlocked the passenger door when the key was removed.  Dealer bought the car back and I'm now driving a 2007 VW GTI.  Dollar for dollar, VW is the better buy.  Only thing missing is the character of the MINI...and the unreliability."
mini,cooper,2006,Joe Metro, 11/23/2006,Great Car - Horrid Gas Mileage,3,"We received our MINI in May '06 - we live in the hills of San Francisco.  It is the perfect city car in terms of being able to park anywhere. The power is great and it easily accommodates two men and a dog.  Our big gripe is that it is only getting 14 mpg in the city - after break in. We have taken it to the dealer to inspect but they insist nothing is wrong and that low mileage is typical in this model. So why do the claim it ""sips gas""?  We are very disappointed that our MINI is as bad as an SUV on mileage."
mini,cooper,2006,GuitarBabe, 12/12/2006,How Fun is This?,4,"I love this car!  Having always owned a 4-cyl. car, I feel it has plenty of power.  It's fun to drive. It gets good gas millage.  This car is just right for one or two people."
mini,cooper,2006,sportscarnut, 06/23/2009,Buy A John Cooper Works,5,"I bought my 06 JCW over a year ago, and I have no regrets.  This is my third BMW, and reliability has been on par with my prior cars (about average), but it is a blast to drive!  The ride is certainly on the rough side, and there is a good amount of noise from the wind and a/c, so be prepared to crank up the radio.  My JCW is rated at about 40 more hp than the S, but you really don't notice the difference in power unless you rev it hard.  The noticeable difference w/ the JCW is in the limited slip differential, the aero body kit, and the brakes.  Cornering versus the standard S is night-and-day difference.  If you are a guy, stay with dark colors as light colors look cutesy on this car."
mini,cooper,2006,skip2211, 10/16/2010,New owner,4,I bought my 2006S in October 2010. i get about 27 mpg city and 30-34 mpg highway. Sunroof will bake the driver as there is no shade ! I am having it limo tinted. Performance is great but ride is VERY stiff. Potholes feel like craters. Great handling and fun to drive. Oil change at Mini dealer is over $100.. Had to buy a bra for it as the front attracts all rocks. I am 65 and feel like a kid again! Holds resale value well but Mini dealers are few and far away and costly. Get rid of the run flat tires but then you have no spare ! It turns heads wherever I go and is bright red.
mini,cooper,2006,ojershelly, 10/04/2005,Amazing ride in such a small package,5,"This car puts the ""kid"" back in all of us!  Lower the top and it brings a smile to your day.  Whoever said ""bigger is better"" never drove a Mini.  Drive one."
mini,cooper,2006,Ernfun, 08/26/2006,What a Great Car,5,"I love my 2006 Mini Cooper S with the John Cooper Works Kit.  I have been to ""performance driving"" schools at Limerock and New Hampsire International Speedway and was able to keep up with cars costing many times more. You really can't describe how the Mini accelerates and handles until you drive it.  The six-speed transmission is unbelievably responsive. I commute 45 minutes each way to work and a boring drive has become an adventure. The sound system is excellent. The back seat is small but I'm able to drive my 12 and 14 year old kids comfortably and they love riding in the car."
mini,cooper,2006,fedssocr, 12/01/2006,"So far, so good",4,"I bought my MINI Cooper in March 2006. I placed the order in January but had to wait a couple of months to get my car. I don't drive very much so I only have about 3,500 miles on it so far. At first, the gas mileage seemed low, but now that everything is broken in it's great. I average over 40 mpg on the highway and about 30 or so combined city/hwy. I am also fairly small so I am quite comfortable. The handling is great. Even though it's ""only"" a base Cooper I still have plenty of passing power and zip when I need it. It's really a great little car. This car is easy to drive, easy to park. "
mini,cooper,2006,scooterluv1, 04/25/2013,Love my SCOOTER!,4,"I have owned many cars in my day, but this scooter (Mini Cooper S) is the most fun to drive. This car is quick, roomy (I am 6'2"", 200#), a sure head-turner and financially economical. Warning: If you are looking for a smooth ride and back seat roominess, pick another car... I bought it 2 years ago w/21000 miles on it and now it has 50000 miles. I have had few issues w/it; (thankfully, I did purchase a good aftermarket warranty) most major issue was w/carbon dirt build-up/clogging up the fuel injectors, but a fuel system flesh ($100.00) and 93/100 octane gas cleared that right up. I am very well pleased w/this blend of Mini/BWN."
mini,cooper,2006,Bob S, 04/19/2009,Think About It,4,"I love the personality of this car! I love the overall design--inside and out, but this car is not really meant for urban driving, especially in areas where there are potholes. In two years I have had to replace the struts twice and the brakes once and the run-flat tires while convenient provide for a jarring ride. The ride on expressways is great and acceleration is great. Think about how much the car costs and if you're ready to deal with it's quirky issues. Also, not as good on gas as one would expect--I averaged 19 mpg, not the best for a car of this size."
mini,cooper,2006,maria, 06/27/2006,"Fun, Fun, Fun",4,"I love my car.  I have the Cooper Convertible and it is a lot of fun to drive...on the street or on the highway.  It has a lot of spunk and get up and go, plus I LOVE the color - Purple Haze.  I never drive unnoticed.  My students think it is an awesome car and always want to go for rides.  Of course they want to take a ride by themselves.  My 25 year-old son at first thought it was a ""chick car.""but he was surprised to find out that when he drove it one day it attracted alot of young women asking asbout the ""Italian Job"" car.  So I guess it is a ""chick car""....."
mini,cooper,2006,sandymonet, 05/11/2008,My Coop,4,"This is the greatest little big car ever! I have no problems with pick up and I can out start my husband in his Corvette! It is beautiful in detailing and comfortable in seating. All controls are right at my finger tips so I do not have to grope around in the dark for anything. The on dash cup holder stinks, but that is minor in comparison to all the fun I have driving (zooming) around town. Glad I bought it especially now with gas prices so high. My gas lasts me about a week and then some. I can hook my ipod up and just go. Just love the way it handles the corners nice and tight at high speeds. The one touch button for top down is an added bonus. You should get one! Be glad you did."
mini,cooper,2006,UKDragon, 06/09/2008,The greatest thing since sliced bread!,5,"What's not to like? The best exterior and interior designed car ever, great fuel economy, you can park it anywhere, still has a great kick in performance, it takes turns like nothing else! Ridiculously fun to drive, and you get to be part of the MINI community- don't forget to wave to other passing MINI owners on the road! One of the  best things about this car is that you get to customize it's appearance however you wish. Go explore their website and virtually design your own MINI! I have had no technical issues with mine, and it's been 2 years. Plus it has a great warranty and the service is BMW quality. Nothing bad to say about it!"
mini,cooper,2006,Fun Commute, 01/01/2009,Fun Commuter,4,"After much research I purchased a used one with 35k miles for local commutes.It's a go cart on steriods. Whole family loves it. It handles as well as anything I've ever driven in the twisty hills we have here and I've driven about every sports car out there. However, at speed on interstate( say 80-90 mph) it gets squirrely. Primarily as a result of torque steer, tight steering and fact it's a square box.I've put 7k on it and have had no maintenance issues except radio. Top is wonderful and surprisingly quiet but you're blind in rear quarterpanels when it's up. Mileage has been so so (24 cty-26 hwy) but pedal has been to floor since I've had it.I'd buy another in a heartbeat.   "
mini,cooper,2006,E-money, 07/01/2009,The all mighty MINI,4,"This car is a lot of fun but it comes with a lot of quirks too. The overall design (in and out) is smooth and pleasing to look at. We have the Racing Pulley accesory which adds horsepower and creates an intoxicating turbo sound when u punch the gas. The only real complaints I have with this car is the fact that with the run flat tires it rides severely stiff. The second is the reliability, from one day to the next the car will act strange (engine sounds, random jumps in electric). But never the less if you are looking to buy one I would highly reccomend it!"
mini,cooper,2006,RM Joy, 10/27/2005,Cooper S the thrill is back,4,"I have been driving my MINI Cooper S for about 6 months, and it still a blast. The  S comes stock with a 168 hp engine, which is plenty of fun, but I did an aftermarket upgrade ($280.00) to bring it up to about 190 hp. I am a lover of small cars, and these cars handle marvelously on the highway or on Oregon's twisty country rodes. Above all, this little car has ""character"". "
mini,cooper,2006,J. Cooper, 12/23/2005,The Most Fun You Can Have in a Car,4,"The MINI Cooper S is as fun as driving gets.  According to every woman the see it it's ""adorable"" I've not yet been impressed with the fuel economy but it's still new and still can't get used to the center console gauges, but it's a small price to pay for this much fun.    "

mini,cooper,2006,NLCOOLJ, 01/20/2006,2006 Mini Cooper S,5,"This car is ...............excellent and lots of fun. I bought a 6-speed manual 2006 Cooper S in Astro black with silver roof and bonnet stripes.  Its options include Premium, Sport, Cold weather, HK Stereo, Chrono meter, Rear fog light, PDC, Piano surface 7 interior, and Limited Slip Differential.  Its fairly quick, fun to drive and I have had many people pay compliments to me about the car. I love its handling.   It provides great value for the money."
mini,cooper,2006,mary, 02/02/2006,I Love this Car!,5,The MINI Cooper S is fun to drive.  I love the details.  It is a hot looking car. I'm getting great gas mileage.  The car hugs the road.
mini,cooper,2006,sicko_q8, 02/26/2006,I'm in Love,5,"I'm only 19 years old.  I have driven the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 330i, but the Mini Cooper S is the best thing I have ever driven.  Even my mom thinks so because she drives the car more then I do (give me my car back).  Now my younger brother is buying one because we all agree that its worth the price."
mini,cooper,2006,John, 03/14/2006,Too Much Fun,5,"This is the most fun car to drive. I cruise at high speeds and it is comfortable. I have a Mini Cooper S with an automatic transmission and it is like having three different transmissions in the car. Full automatic for normal driving and high fuel economy, sport automatic for increased performace, and manual stick or on steering wheel paddle shifting. Although, the transmission sometimes can act a little strange, ie. not hitting the correct gear. I look for excuses to drive this car."
mini,cooper,2006,Tammy, 03/23/2006,"Pep, style and function",5,I have an Acura and an Audi in the driveway. I pick the MINI every time. I drop the top in freezing weather on a sunny day! I am getting 27-28 mpg in the city. I navigate a lot of small streets and parking is a breeze. It's spoiled me. Really. 
mini,cooper,2006,Allison Mayer, 04/21/2006,I Love my Mini Cooper Convertible,5,"It's so fun to drive that I look for excuses to go places so that I can get in my Mini and go. It looks great and is much more interesting-looking than other cars on the road. It is very roomy inside. The stereo is terrific. There are so many standard bells and whistles that I still am learning how they all work. This is the ""funnest"" vehicle I've ever ridden in or driven. It makes me smile and lifts my spirits whenever I drive it. My other car is a '98 Toyota 4Runner, which I absolutely love. But my Mini is the most fun. I love the attitude of the company too. It doesn't take itself too seriously."
mini,cooper,2006,Panzey, 05/23/2006,Fun to Motor in a Mini,5,I've not had a bad day with my Mini!  After a long day in the office I quickly lower the top and off I go with the breeze flowing through my hair!  It has a lot of gusto!  When we take it for short weekend trips we lower the backseats and have plenty of room for our bags/gear!  
mini,cooper,2006,erik shryock, 06/18/2006,Mini is Awesome,5,"I am very delighted that I bought this wonderful machine. Having BMW behind it you can sure tell the quality of this product. I had driven a friends two years ago and fell in love with it. I have been shopping for luxury autos for leasing; but, when Mini made this convertible and I test drove it with top down at BMW i quickly purchased it in stead of a BMW.  I feel you get your money worth and its cute to boot. Thank you."
mini,cooper,2006,Zooming Mini, 07/11/2006,The Most Fun Ever,4,I have had my Mini for just over a month and have put 1300 miles on it already (this includes a 10 day trip out of town while Mini stayed home). Driving a Mini is the most fun I have ever had driving a car. It is a dream in busy city traffic and comfortable on my long drives to the beach. 
mini,cooper,2006,Arobryn, 07/12/2006,Lotta Love for My Little MINI,4,"When my Honda Prelude lost a cylinder I was crushed. I loved that car. I decided to buy new, did the research and got an economy car - Mazda3. I almost took it back with buyer's remorse. The Mazda3 is probably the sportiest economy car you'll find, but it is no comparison to my Prelude. By the beginning of this year I was determined to get something new. I never looked at the MINI as I couldn't take the car seriously because of it's looks. After sitting in one I did some research and finally ordered from the factory.  After two months it arrived five days ago and I'm in love, again! I got a Pure Silver MCS Convertible with JCWorks Kit and that 207hp moves my little street-legal go-kart like a DREAM!"
mini,cooper,2006,minicoupah, 08/03/2006,Best Money Spent,4,"This is my second Cooper Convertible. I owned a base model for one year then traded up to the ""S"". The ""S"" is superior (actually stands for ""Special"") in all aspects. I ordered it my way with limited slip, DSC, xenon lamps, front & rear fog, premium pak #1 and cold-weather pak. Also I opted for 16"" proformance tires. I learned that the 17""'s are too harsh for lousy Massachusetts roads and don't plan on running it in the snow. This vehicle is a driver's vehicle. With the proper driver, there are not many cars that can match it in performance and handling. Oh, there are bigger, better, faster and more cars but NONE (at least in this price class) can compare to the ini Cooper S ragtop."
mini,cooper,2006,Laura Rennick, 02/16/2006,Excellent,4,"The Mini is an excellent car, it handles great especially on curves. I have only had it for about two months now and have absolutely fallen in love with it. The interior design is wonderful, everything is very accessible and the inside is surprisingly roomy. It rides very smoothly and will get up and go, you have to be careful because your speed will get away from you. I highly recommend this car."
mini,cooper,2006,Tonnelier, 06/12/2006,The Most Fun Car Ever Built,5,"I've only had it for a week, but I'm in love! Without a doubt, it the cutest thing on the road.  It drives like a dream, hugs the road tightly, even without the Dynamic Stability Control or the Sport Suspension.  The Harmon Kardon stereo is so good that you can hear piano jazz at 65 miles an hour with the top down. Power windows and top are standard, I believe, as are remote door and trunk locks. In fact, you can put the top down with the remote!  The warranty covers all service for 3 years. And the ""Ultimate"" plan covers tire and windshield damage as well.  The only drawbacks are backseat leg room and a tiny trunk. But if you're hung up on those things, buy a minivan!"
mini,cooper,2006,llblasi, 06/12/2006,MINI s with JCW Tuner Kit,4,"The Mini Cooper S with JCW tuner kit is a tight, fast pocket rocket that loves to be thrown into tight corners.  The fun factor is definitly a 10."
mini,cooper,2006,pill grl, 06/23/2006,LOVE this CAR!,5,"This car is incredible - if you are even thinking of purchasing one you must drive it before deciding against it. I get at least one comment per day like ""nice ride,"" ""awesom car,"" etc. A friend of mine said he was thinking about a MINI and bought a VW instead - all I said was you didn't drive one did you? He said ""no - how did I know that"" I said because you didn't buy one."
mini,cooper,2006,Harddo @ Mini, 06/23/2006,Fun in the sun!,4,I am really enjoying my Mini Cooper Convertible S JCW.  It rejuvinates me and puts a smile on my face. The snarl from the exhaust gets the blood going.  
mini,cooper,2006,d, 08/16/2006,Little Hot Chili,4,"This is the best car to be resurrected. Unlike many movies, this sequel is equally as great as the original."
mini,cooper,2006,Ken w/Evan's help, 09/01/2006,What a Blast!,4,The Mini Cooper S' acceleration and handling are awesome.  This car manuevers better than any car I have ever had the chance to drive.  BMWs and Audis are unable to keep up. The performance of this vehicle is the selling point but there are so many other features on this car. The window automatically rolls down 1/2 inch when you open the door and then closes up tightly when you shut it.  No more ear popping. The car is so tight that you can be in a high gear at low speed and it still drives smoothly without chugging along like other cars would do. Hold down the button on the key fob and all the windows and sunroof open automatically. The car will let you know when you have a flat tire. Go test drive one! 
mini,cooper,2006,flying high girl, 09/06/2006,"Love, Love, Love my MINI",5,"This is truly a fun car to drive.  It is so small, but with the S motor it's got killer pickup.  I love the sound of the engine.  It's a quiet ride, with the seats folded down, you can get some storage.  Be prepared to get stopped a lot, people love asking questions about it.  I hit a deer late at night and it only did minimal damage.  I was stunned.  The only downfall is since it's so low and small, I have to wash it a lot.  Beware of truckers, rocks hit me a lot on highway.  Its pickup is wonderful.  I love the one button everything goes down with the top feature.  The heated leather seats are great.  It has lots of leg room upfront.  When going on trips that require lots of luggage, you have to think MINI.  My pug Matilda and I love it!"
mini,cooper,2006,melissa, 09/20/2006,Love This Car,4,This car is every bit as much fun as it looks. It's also very solid. I was recently rear-ended and couldn't believe how sturdy the car is. 
mini,cooper,2006,SDBluebird, 10/13/2006,SD Bluebird,5,"This is a great car!  The lowest mileage that I have seen on a tank of gas is 24.9 mpg and the highest has been 36.  Its gas mileage depends on if the top is up or down.  This car has great safety features, mine has an excellent GPS system that will calculate the fastest or shortest route for you.  The GPS  talks to you to let you know of upcoming turns as well as showing them on the display.  This is the only convertible I know of that you can also drive with the sunroof open. The cold weather package alerts you when the outside temperature reaches 37 and roads could become icy.  I had no trouble on a recent cross country trip where I drove in fog, rain, sleet, snow and beautiful sunshine.  It also delivers great performance!"

mini,cooper,2006,Linda, 11/04/2006,Luv my Coop!,4,"So far this car has been the greatest.  It handles beautifully, has great pickup and is as cute as a bug.  I have a Hot Orange Convertible!  I traded in a 2005 Cadillac XLR, so I am trying something very different. I like the interior size.  Having a back seat is a big benefit, even if it is a tight squeeze to get in it. It does not get the great gas mileage I expected.  I only get about 25 mpg.  For it's size, and engine, I expected better."
mini,cooper,2006,bean, 11/29/2006,2006 MINI Cooper S 2dr Convertible,5,I love this car!  It is zippy as heck :).
mini,cooper,2006,safetydriven, 11/29/2006,My Mini,5,"I love my Mini. We use her in a driving school and the students love driving her. In a Mini, height is not a problem, if the student is short the seat can easily be raised and if they are tall there is plenty of leg room. Students learn from the very beginning how easy it is to move the steering wheel just a little and the direction changes quickly."
mini,cooper,2006,Jim W., 01/03/2007,Driving While Smiling,4,"I've been driving my MINI S 6-speed since August, and always buckle up smiling... something I can't say about my previous car - the '03 Jetta 5-speed from VW (a great car itself). This car has very sporty handling, great styling inside and out, and an engine which I would rather listen to than any radio or music! I love the bright red and chrome accents inside. You just never forget that you are driving a special car.  I don't race about, but any time a curve comes along I can't help but raise the revs and enjoy the thrill of this car's cornering.  The fit and reliability so far have been excellent - some features like the toggles may seem quirky but that's the British touch!"
mini,cooper,2006,Kevin, 01/14/2007,Great Car for the Money,4,"I've driven my MINI 3,200 miles so far. Although there are some bad reviews about the reliability of Minis, I haven't experienced any problems with mine. I drove many cars including Porsche and Lotus before Mini, and I have to say Mini tops the chart in most fun to drive category. My appreciation for the car's design in and out grows every time I look at it. Finally, its resale value is amazing. I don't think there are people who buy a cars and sell them for higher prices than Mini owners, true story. "
mini,cooper,2006,Mom loves Mini, 08/29/2007,My Favorite Car to Date!,5,"The Mini is excellent in the snow. Forget the 4-wheel big SUV, this little car handles the snow better than any other car I owned. In the summer, the Mini begs to be driven on the open road. Also, I have yet to find a parking spot that I can't fit into. I went to New York in the winter. At first the parking garage said there was no room, but when they saw my Mini, they found room for that car!  I have yet to use my husbands truck to go grocery shopping. My Mini holds it all  and then some!!  I have yet to have a bad experience with my car.  Just seeing my car makes me smile and I say ""Mini, mini, mini!!"" "
mini,cooper,2006,2MANYCARS, 11/13/2007,Good things come in small packages,5,"A pocket hot rod, Goliath killer. I have all the high perf. options and love the overall package performance. A couple of laps at Sebring surprised my brother who races a Porsche there. Stable, fast, excellent brakes, peppy engine. If you want thrifty car, buy a VW diesel. This is about fun and ""low self esteem "", they will look at you for sure. Bought HK Sound and Chrono Package. Love them. Chili Red with Silver top different look altogether from Red/White. Would buy again."
mini,cooper,2006,BK, 11/15/2007,'06 Hyper Blue Cooper!,4,"This car screams! I always look forward to driving it, whether on an 800 mile round trip to the mountains, or a 2 mile trip to the store. Acceleration is super, as is braking. Cornering is something to look forward to, as there is no detectable lean, even when pushing what I would call normal ""around town"" driving. I have never had trouble merging onto the freeway, making that last-minute 3-lane lane change if I have to, or parking. My biggest worry is if someone dings one of the doors. I have the GPS system, which is not only hugely useful, but great fun. It gets twice the mileage of my V-8 SUV, which I keep because it's paid off, and sometimes I need to haul wood or dirt - not for a Mini!"
mini,cooper,2006,MJM, 09/05/2005,I Love My Car,5,I've had my Mini Cooper for only a week however I love this car and just about everyone that sees its ask me questions about it.
mini,cooper,2006,jaimief, 08/29/2011,My Mini has driven me off the deep end!,2,"I bought a 2006 mini cooper hatchback automatic and have had nothing but HORRIFIC problems from the start!
Where to begin, well all of the internal accessories have either fallen off broke, or cracked within the first year, including: cup holder, visor, change cup holder lid, and cigarette lighter!! Then someone smashed into my car and nearly totaled it, Prestige mini was responsible for fixing the damage and had me drive up there three times because they could not fix it properly.
After the third time, it still was not fixed, the better business needed to get involved and still to this day, 4 years later, my car still is the most unreliable car imaginable.
Terrible customer service!"
mini,cooper,2006,Fivechip, 06/26/2006,A Star Car,5,I traded a 2003 Mini Cooper in on the 2006 Mini Cooper S Convertible and wow what a difference in power and smoothness.  The 6-speed transmission shifts like butter compared to the 2003's 5-speed transmission.  I loved the '03 model but the '06 is so much better.
mini,cooper,2006,Orlando, 08/26/2006,Take It for a Long Test Drive,3,"I had a Mini S Convertibe for four months and got rid of it. The car is nice to look at it but my sincere opinion is that is more of marketing hype that truly a good purchase. Various sites rate the Mini as having great resale value, but I found the hard way that not to be true. If you are really considering one take it for a really long test drive and please do not buy it with leatherete which is very hot and unconfortable.  Also, I would recommend an automatic with paddle shifters, because of the weak engine you shift all the time in order to find the right gear. The Sport package is a great value and the convertible top with two functions is great.  Finally for the money ($31,000) there better buys out there!"
mini,cooper,2006,14characters, 07/16/2011,"MINI, Test drive one to understand...",4,"This is my first MINI & I would buy another, given the chance. Fun to Drive, always. Reliable?
After logging 73,000 miles without incident, I can say yes. Great service from the dealer from new.
As Small as it seems, I can easily carry 8' pieces of lumber inside if needed. Plenty 'o' leg room in the front. Fine for my young one in the back. Glued to the road. I slid on some gravel on a back country road moving at a good pace, yep! handles like a go-cart, I felt safe."
mini,cooper,2006,ROBERT E. CLAPROTH, 11/06/2015,not in my posession anymore SOLD it sometime ago.,4,"This car has a good amount of mileage on it mostly driven on Freeways,always garaged and kept in good maintenance shape-and was never involved in an accident.----- sadly to report that I no longer own this car traded it in for a Subaru all-wheel drive Impreza.  Thanks for using your service.

mini,cooper,2006,Clement Danhoui, 07/10/2016,Great classy excellent condition car.,5, 
mini,cooper,2006,Mr. B, 12/01/2005,better than my corvette,5,"I have had the competition and this is the best. I had a porche 914, a mazda miata and a corvette. The mini blows them away. Everyone said i was crazy foe selling my 2002 corvette for a mini cooper but it was a good choice. The mini is not tempermental and can be driven as a daily driver instaed of just a sunday driver like my other ""Toy"" cars have been. I can't stop revving and driving it hard. I am a big guy (300lbs) and fit very comfortably in it. It also has goos storage whwn the rear seats are folded down. Mine is pepper white with a black top and black stripes. I also upgraded the wheels to 17's. I also got the automatic transmission which I highly recommend. Its exactly like a stick!"
mini,cooper,2006,jean, 11/29/2006,Great car,4,"I love my MINI.  It's fun to drive, gets good gas mileage in town and on the highway, and fits into tight places."
mini,cooper,2006,Craig, 05/01/2006,Second MINI I have owned and the best,5,"I first owned a 2003 MINI Cooper that I purchased off the dealer's floor. I owned it for almost 3 years. I at first wanted to order the 2007 with the newer engine, but after much research I decided that the 2006 engine had at least 7 years use behind it, as it first was introduced in late 2000 as a 2001 model in England. I included the JCW Air Intake which boosted the HP to around 178 or so. I ordered the ""S"" in Dec '05 and took delivery in Feb '06. The build date is 01/06. I followed it through the shutdown over the holidays and up to delivery here. The 2006 is a great improvement over the 2003 model.  I recommend this ride to any and all that are up to having a smile transfixed on thir face!"
mini,cooper,2006,travlr, 09/29/2006,Sporty and Fun,4,"My red Mini with a black roof, black bonnet stripes, and Union Jack side and interior mirror makes many people smile as I drive by.  It's quick and maneuverable in Manhattan traffic.  I rarely drive higher than 3rd gear in the city and it scoots into the traffic lanes very nicely."
mini,cooper,2006,Ace, 07/18/2006,How Do You Spell Dog? Mini!,2,"Yeah, it's cute.  But a movie doesn't make it fast.  The Mini is: 1. dog slow, 2. has a rear blind spot 3. the top doesn't tuck away, 4. it has no cover for the top, 5. no rear seat lighting, 6. no power seats, 7. you sit low so it is hard to see out of, 8. it has no satellite radio, 9. the stereo stinks, 10. I hate the retro guages, give us state-of-the art. 11. and include a built-in iPod jack."
mini,cooper,2006,Dave Finski, 10/27/2008,Loved it since I bought it.,5,"I've loved my 2006 Mini convertible since I bought it brand new. My wife asked me what I'd get on my next one that I didn't get on the one I bought. My answer, ""nothing"". There isn't anything I feel I should have opted for. Nothing I opted for that I should have done without. Opted for the basic engine. Saved money and don't need the extra horsepower, extra complexity of the turbo now mileage loss from being assertive with the gas pedal. Got the chrome exterior do-dads to cheer it up, leather bolstered seats, AC, manual transmission, more chrome do-dads inside and heated seats. Must get the heated seats. Awesome when the air gets a bit chilly. Now my wife wants her own!"
mini,cooper,2006,JKPowers67, 01/13/2009,Great Car! But....,4,"The Mini has been a great around town car, providing solid performance and a lot of fun. If my driving were still largely in town I would never get rid of it. However, I now commute 70 miles per day over rougher surface highways and the road noise is very significant. It makes it hard to talk on the phone, and in a quiet car (no music) it's just annoying. Reliability has been good, but the minor things that have come up required a 2 hour drive to pick up the car. The whole experience has been great, but it's time to move on. I pick up my Infinity G37 this afternoon. But I'll really miss my Mini."
mini,cooper,2006,Hillary, 01/18/2009,Fun to Drive! when not being repaired.,4,"After 2 months of having it, I had the EML light go on and the car went into fail safe mode (9 mph). It did this on the 405 freeway, not very safe and very scary! I had the extended warranty and MINI roadside assistance came to pick it up. Apparantly it was the throttle body. 4 months later the same issue. This time it was the computer. 6 months later the same thing, this time they said it was just a fluke, everythings fine. Again 2 more times in the past 5 months. The MINI dealership is 35 miles away from my home, so this started to become a huge inconvenience especially with no rental car."
mini,cooper,2006,mangopop, 03/01/2009,Sad but True,3,"I bought my Mini in 2006. It was the ONLY car I wanted and I fell in love with it instantly. After 1 1/2 years, and about 12K miles I started having all sorts of electrical problems. Ive had more sensors go off than I knew were in the car! Airbag sensor, Gas sensor..and a few more that I don't remember the name for. I have now been in and out of the dealership every month for the last 5 months and i'm really disappointed that my Mini cooper did not live up to my expectations. I was hoping for it to be around for a while, now I'm looking to let it go before the warranty is up. "
mini,cooper,2006,jfied, 06/15/2009,So Much Fun!,4,"I bought my Cooper Hatchback used with 13.4k miles, and I absolutely love it.  Yes, it's a little on the loud side, and rough roads make for a bumpy ride.  But this is absolutely ""the most fun"" car I have ever driven!  It absolutely hugs the road - I love putting the sunroof down (and the seat heaters on if it's chilly) on a sunny day, especially if I have the luxury of a drive across the back roads.  However, I live in an urban area, and most of my driving is a rush-hour commute. I still wouldn't change the car.  I get about 27 MPG in town (bumper-to-bumper) and 33 MPG on the highway. "
mini,cooper,2006,Suzanna, 10/01/2009,Almost Perfect,4,"A lot of fun, but lacks some practicality. Got rid of the run-flat tires to improve gas mileage and my dog kept stepping on the reset button anyway. Warning: no matter how considerate of a driver you might be, there are other drivers who are outright hostile to Mini Coopers (I've had other people confirm this).  Maybe it's jealousy. Either way, watch out for it. "
mini,cooper,2006,Happy, 11/18/2005,I'm Happy with Happy,4,"Just sitting in my MINI Cooper (Happy) puts a smile on my face.  Very few cars can do that anymore. It handles like a GoKart and gets good economy.  The only issue that I have had with it is that BMW says to use Premium Fuel, which is a bummer.  The back seats are not usefull unless those in front are small also. Otherwise, this car is a beatiful piece of machinery."
mini,cooper,2006,fabworks, 11/19/2005,My third Mini,4,I have purchased three MINIs since 2002 and also own a Porsche 911 Cabriolet. The only reason my Porsche gets driven is to get washed and on a once a month drive down the coast. I love driving my Minis for everyday use. 
mini,cooper,2006,MiniMan, 12/27/2005,Sports Car Moves in Retro Style Package,5,"We bought the MINI because it looks great.  We love the MINI because it is a sportscar in hatchback clothing.  This little car begs to be driven.  You'll find yourself searching out winding roads to go blasting down.  It is a real treat.  If you are on the fence about this car, spend some test drive time driving on a twisty 2 lane road and you will be signing your order immediately.  After an hour you will feel like you have been driving this car for years.  All the moves on the road inspire confidence.  It has plenty of room up front for someone 6'4"", however there will be no backseat room behind someone of this height.  "
mini,cooper,2006,jim d, 02/06/2006,Love my Mini,4,I am absolutely in love with my new MINI Cooper S.  It's zippy when you need to take off.  Its sharp modern design pays homage to the Minis of the past.
mini,cooper,2006,Debi, 03/01/2006,Mini,4,"This car is just too fun!  It puts a smile on my face whenever I just look at it.  The mileage is better than my last car and it handles like a dream.  I do wish I would have purchased the S, mine is a little sluggish off the line.  Overall, I couldn't be more pleased."
mini,cooper,2006,Mike, 03/29/2006,An every day car!,4,"This is my fifth Mini. I've had a Mini classic, 2004 Cooper, 2005 Cooper Convertible, 2005 Mini Cooper S Convertible, and now a 2006 White Pepper Cooper S Convertible. This is such a fun car to drive, especially going round corners. It's nippy and fun! I have so many options...some of the major ones are: aero kit, (custom chrome grill), 17"" web spoke wheels, xenon headlamps, additonal racing lights, chrome exterior, chrome line interior, navigation, automatic transmission with paddles (one of the greates features), auxillary gauges, sport package, premium package, cold weather package, convienience packaage, front fog lights, rear fog light (great for backing off drivers too close or those with brights on), and the wind deflector."
mini,cooper,2006,Daves1mini, 04/21/2006,I've had lots of cars - Mini is best,4,"I've had my Mini for 2 weeks, the standard.  I decided not to buy the turbo version because I did not want to have to buy premium gas..  The standard model has plenty of pep for me. Who said it was sluggish?  I paid much more for a Jaguar X-Type and the Mini has more extras than it and is far more fun to drive.  I love it!"
mini,cooper,2006,ElmerFudd, 05/04/2006,There's Nothing Wrong with My MINI,5,"My all black 2005 Cooper S draws in the guys and the girls.  It's hot fun to drive, everything always works, it has no sqeaks or noises, and has lot of pure driver pleasure for the gearhead.  The mid-60s interior and deep throttle rumble evoke the golden age of sports motoring, but without the pools of oil under the engine and jiggling the under dash wires to get the starter or radio to work.  I live in the land of exotic machines (San Francisco), but my all-black Cooper has the highest fun/dollar and status/dollar ratio of any of them.  Oh yes it is really easy to park, and surprisingly practical for around town with 3-4 people in it and for longer trips with two.  Buy it or you'll never forgive yourself."
mini,cooper,2006,kl, 06/02/2006,What more could you ask for...,5,"This is one of the few vehicles that has everything going for it, a great warranty, insane resale value, low maintenance, fun to drive, good gas mileage and it is easy to park. :-)  I have had a lot of nice cars, a Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4, Cadillac STS, Z28 Camaro, and an '04 Cooper S.  So this is my second MINI.  I just can't seem to get away from them.   This is car you have to drive to understand."
mini,cooper,2006,epaquin, 06/07/2006,It's the best.,5,"I love to drive my Mini. It's comfy, roomy, everything. and I'm a big girl. I'm 5'11"" and i fit comfortably in it. So if you are in the market, I would go for it."
mini,cooper,2006,MiniAndMe, 06/19/2006,Finally got one,4,"I finally got my Mini Coopeer S.  I had to go 1,500 miles to get it. The drive home was the most fun I have had in a while, breaking it in and getting to know it in one fell swoop. The passing is tremendous. The HK stereo is just about perfectly powered and balanced.  The combo sun/moofroof is great for cruising, although the roofracks seem to whistle and deflect bugs to the sunroof.  This is easy to fix though, they come off and cap in about 10 minutes.  I'm 6'2"", and still have to move the seat up about 3 clicks from the back, but I pity the people in the back seat behind me.  My wife loves it so much I think I'll get her a non-S to keep her out of mine!  Drive one, you'll love it."
mini,cooper,2006,jasper, 07/02/2006,Excellent,5,This car is so fun to drive and reliable. I was pleasently suprised by all of the features that it has.  I wouldn't have expected them because when I first saw it I just though it was a cute car. The features coupled with the price make this the best car I have ever owned!
mini,cooper,2006,hctiev, 07/03/2006,This Car Rocks!,5,I chose this car over an Acura TL - why?  The fun factor!  I've gone from HAVING to spend time in the car to WANTING to spend time in the car.  I have yet to find two Mini's that are identical.  BMW did this right.  I now have a car that has all of the British nature combined with the best of German engineering.  I'm keeping this car forever.    
mini,cooper,2006,jkdy, 07/10/2006,My Mini Tex,5,"I bought my mini (""Tex"") used in Dec. '04 from a dealer.  I am a car nut, but Tex has totally hit all the right buttons; I don't have a desire for any other car. I don't like that the dealer is 150+ miles away; it makes getting it serviced tough.  I have also bent two rims on icky Michigan roads. I hate that and would like if there were more practical tire options since I drive 75 miles a day.  But even with that; when I go to think of another type of car, nothing else is as much fun as the ""cute"" factor, that everybody from middle-aged ladies to young, make car mechanics, to practical hubbies always seem to comment about.  My Tex has the big attitude to match his name and his performance.  It's unmatchable!"
mini,cooper,2006,semitame, 07/25/2006,Mini Max,5,"My Mini has replaced an Audi RS6 as a runabout vehicle. I have an Audi Q7 on order for harsh situations. Going about town with my little go-cart is a blast. I ttook it on freeway from CT to NH. It is a little less friendly on poorly-maintained highways. It has lots of vibrations and I think I need to replace the performance run-flat tires with all-weather tires, and maybe adjust the shocks.  I am old. Altogether my 500 mile trip was enjoyable. Pay attention on those bumps...make sure you land where you intended!"
mini,cooper,2006,Bthayer23, 08/09/2006,MINI Turns Heads,5,"The first week I owned this car, I gave my boss's daughter a ride around the block and answered questions from three complete strangers about my MINI.  It's a flashy car by virtue of its uniqueness, but it has the zip and handling to back it up.  Its sensible fuel economy doesn't hurt, either.  Take a spin in a MINI at night.  The huge speedo gives the whole car an orange glow, and the giant sunroof lets in the moonlight."
mini,cooper,2006,KCKel, 08/08/2006,Fast and Fun!,5,"Speed Limits spoil the enjoyment of driving this car!  That is the only negative thing I can say about it so far.  I highly recommend it!  If you want a small and peppy car, this is it!  No need to test drive anything else.  I am 5'6'' and my husband is 6'  we both fit in it perfectly.  We fight over who gets to drive it.  It has numerous features such as leather heated seats, Harmon/Kardon stereo system, computer which indicates fuel consumption, miles left before needing fuel, and xenon head lights."
mini,cooper,2006,T.C., 08/17/2006,Cooper S Report Card,3,"This is one of the most fun cars I've ever driven...BUT it rides like my Grandfather's 1958 pickup, there's no give and you feel every bump in the road which causes bent/broken struts and or the brackets. It has seating for four with the LATCH system but it's really a 2 seater. When a carseat is installed there's no room for it to be occupied unless the person in the front seat is 4 feet tall with their seat all the way forward. Being small doesn't mean saving money at the pump due to using premium gas. The limited number of dealerships creates problems for the consumer both buying/selling and getting repairs/maintanence done. When there's only one dealership in the state it's very detramental for everyone."
mini,cooper,2006,Blitz, 10/06/2005,Excellent car,5,"This is the best small car you can find.  It's like buying a small BMW 3-Series because the interior has lots of BMW parts.  It is very fun to drive, and a very unique car.  2006 is the last year for this generation so the build quality is perfect.  I look forward to driving in my Mini every morning.  "
mini,cooper,2006,cphoebus, 11/23/2005,WOW!,4,"I just got my MINI Cooper S and I love it! Everyone wants to drive it and tells me how cool it is. I didn't like the looks of them at first but they grew on me. I am super happy with my new purchase! If you can afford it, definitely get the S model."
mini,cooper,2006,My MINI, 01/12/2006,My New Red Mini,5,"I had to travel about 80 miles to the nearest dealership to see the Mini.  It was love at first site!  I live in the city where one has to use street parking.  Buying a bigger car or SUV would not make my life easier.  Since I bought my Mini, I can park where others can't!  It's wonderful not to have to drive around to find a parking place. I bought my Mini for its compact size and great gas mileage.  I didn't realize I was buying a sports car as well! "
mini,cooper,2006,RRS, 01/15/2006,2nd MINI...Love All Over Again,4,"I loved my 2004 Cooper S so much that I traded it in for an 2005 Cooper S Convertible. The only issue I had with the '04 was a problem with the radio display.  t became garbled when the temperature fell below 0 degrees.  The radio was replaced by BMW.  My dealer gave me only $2,000 less than what I paid for my 2004 when I bought it new.  You gotta love that love depreciation! The convertible is even more fun than my hard top. I recommend this fun, reliable go kart to everybody - I've already referred 5 sales to my dealership!"
mini,cooper,2006,JOHN GUIDA, 01/14/2006,Love My Mini,5,"I have read some of your reviews. Some were negative about this car's pep.  I have been suprised to the opposite.  The Mini Cooper has more pep than I expected it to.  Therefore I am thrilled with my Mini Convertable (not the ""s"" model).  Your profesonal reviews had me a little nervous after ordering the car.  I'm assuming you're using teenagers to do your reviews. I'm forty eight years old and this is the most fun car I had ever had to drive.  If you want to see a cheap interior look at the Pontiac Solstice.  Mini has thought of features on this car that I would have never expected."
mini,cooper,2006,James Samuel, 02/15/2006,Grinning ear to ear.,4,"Driving my new Mini S Coupe is a breath of fresh air.  I stand 6'6"" and can comfortably fit in driver's seat.  After driving large pickups for my daily drivers the Mini has been a welcome change.  Not only is it fun to drive, but it has cut my weekly fuel bill by two thirds!  I am using those savings to find me an older pickup that is free from all of the new fangled technology that plagues pickups today."
mini,cooper,2006,B Walker, 03/01/2006,My 2nd MINI,4,"My 2006 Hyper Blue / black top Mini Cooper S has the premium package, sport package w/webspokes, cold weather package, ltd slip, anthracite headliner, and leather seats w/blue inserts.  This car is better than my '04 Cooper in every way.  The body is tighter with no squeaks or rattles.  The ride is actually better with the 17 inch wheels than my '04 was with the 16's.  The webspokes are gorgeous.  The small upgrade in power and change in gearing makes the car feel as quick as the '04 was with the TMS pulley package.  I will upgrade the '06 as well when the pulley package is available.  I looked at the Subaru WRX STI (incredibly low and super harsh ride) and the new Volkswagen GTI (pretty cool but it ain't no MINI!).  I love this car.     "
mini,cooper,2006,Bilbo Baggins, 03/22/2006,'06 MINI Cooper S,4,"This is a daily driver and weekend warrior. It is also called upon for long distance travel duty. The build quality is much better than my old '02 MINI Cooper S. The ride, especially over potholes and expansion joints, has been improved without sacrificing handling. Gearing changes have improved the acceleration. The ECU upgrades have solved several old drivability issues. This is still the most enjoyable vehicle that I have ever owned whether on a 5 hour drive or a weekend at the track.  It makes the everyday commute something to look forward to. I can not get into my car without smiling. But, it is not for everone. Because it is only 2 door it is not a great family car. It is difficult to put carseats in the back."
mini,cooper,2006,Bob, 03/21/2006,"Coop, Coop, Coop",5,"This is a great car. It's fun to drive, well engineered, gets good gas mileage, looks sharp, corners like a race car, and accelerates with the best of them.  I drive it on a 36 mile commute every day and love it.  It does not drive like a small car.  It feels very solid on the road."
mini,cooper,2006,rubugd, 03/22/2006,my MINI review,5,"I just bought my MINI four days ago. I hate not being in it. Even though it is still too cold, I have been sporting the top down with the heater blasting. This little car has some attitude and speed. I love it!"
mini,cooper,2006,Small but Mighty, 04/03/2006,Small But Mighty,5,I've owned my MINI for almost 5 months now and I can't begin to explain how much I love this car.  Everything from the toggle switches inside to the supercharged 1.6L engin make me smile ear to ear. it is the only car that I've owned that makes me look forward to driving in the morning. It's simply amazing.
mini,cooper,2006,Craig, 04/18/2006,2006 MCS w/JCW Air Filter,4,"This is my second MINI, my first was a 2003 MINI Cooper. I was going to wait for the new 2007 and new engine, but decided that new French engines wouldn't be a good choice in the first build year. I ordered and waited nine weeks for delivery. I have not been disappointed. The power is 100% better than the 2003 model's and the interior is superior also. As with any ""new"" car I have had a few minor problems, none in the powerplant. Overall this MCS drives and handles like a dream and it brings a smile to me everytime out.  Whether I purchase another MCS is for the future, I am enjoying this one too much now to even think about that. I would highly recommend this to any driver looking for a change in style!"
mini,cooper,2006,soggy, 04/28/2006,Brand New MINI Cooper S,5,"My MINI Cooper S is a brand new car. It has had so no problems thus far.  I absolutely love driving the car, it makes me want to drive too much..."
mini,cooper,2006,Rebecca, 05/15/2006,Love my MINI,5,I have actually had my MINI since November of 2002.  It is the most fun I have had on four wheels!  The service that I have received (when necessary) has been wonderful!  It is truly a joy to own - - my next car will be a MINI Cooper S.
mini,cooper,2006,Londoner@aol.com, 06/23/2006,My Mini Cooper S,5,"My 2006 Mini Cooper S is fun, fast, and It gets admired constantly.  It's zippy and has an amazing amount of room in it for storage."
mini,cooper,2006,Bill Prueter, 08/27/2006,Where Form Meets Function,5,"I looked at Mini over a two year period.  I test drove it three times before my purchase.  I could not be happier.  I am impressed that it is the smallest car (143 inches) yet holds four people.  My son is 6' 2"" and says it is the nicest car he has ever driven (for fun he and I often test drive cars on Saturdays).  His leg length does mean that someone can not sit behind him.  Other wise we have had four people in the car ride comfortably.  This car has zip.  My Miata (former car) cornered very well, but this car performs even better.  Its acceleration is wonderful.  However, on a trip to New York I achieved 44.1 mpg one time and 41.5 another.  I live in a small town and typically get 30 mpg."
mini,cooper,2006,david a walsh, 09/02/2006,Fun to Drive,5,"The 2006 Mini Cooper S is the most fun I've had in 50 years!  It's like a go kart on steroids, that turns heads.  With the top down everyone feels free to talk to you.  Most say ""looks cute and fun to drive.""  I agree!  This is a well built vehicle.  It feels solid and tight.  I have been getting 18 to 28 mpg in city driving depending upon how heavy my foot is.  If I'm careful, I think that I could average around 25 mpg city.  This car has a very stiff suspension hard on bumps, but it is great in turns.  I love my mini"
mini,cooper,2006,AliMia/MINI-Neemo, 09/08/2006,My MINI Soulmate - A Total Joy !,5,"I never thought that it was possible to love a car so much!!  I Truly feel as as if it were my kindred spirit!  I custom built this MINI Cooper-S Convertible on the MINI USA Website at least seven months before I bought it. I test drove four other convertibles, but they just didn't capture the spirit of who I am.  Even though my test drive MINI wasn't a convertible, I loved the tight response the steering wheel delivered and was totally surprised by the room inside. Yes, it's actually very spacious and accomodates all kinds of ""personal junk"" inside and out of sight from curious lookers. If you're a kid at heart - this is the car for you.  It's a go-kart with soul.  Plus it has super safety features and great power! It is exclusive and unique!  "
mini,cooper,2006,angel, 09/07/2006,Moving My Mini,5,"Our new Mini has made drives so much fun. I love passing people and having them stare at us, it's cool. I love the waves you get from other Mini owners. It handels like a dream, we haven't had a manual transmission car in years and it just makes the ride and car more fun than ever. "
mini,cooper,2006,Anabela , 09/29/2006,I Love My New Mini,4,"I just purchased my first Mini after wanting one for the last three years.  It is so much fun to drive and is truly the kind of car I don't mind making payments on every month.  It handles very well, has great personality and fits into any parking spot out there."
mini,cooper,2006,2003 Mini, 10/18/2006,Tire Troubles,4,"Love this car, but the tires are difficult on it.  You have to check the air pressure weekly since they are runflats and to replace them its around $200 per tire. Also, you can't get the tires replaced just anywhere.  You must go to a certified foregin car dealer that uses a special machine to change run flats. This is the only downfall of this car so far, but its a biggie since changing all four tires can cost around $1,000 dollars."
mini,cooper,2006,Kate, 10/18/2006,I Love It!,5,Bought my MINI about a month ago.  This car is really fun to drive!  I like it even more than I thought I would.  It is easy to zip around town and fit into any parking spot.  I have had absolutely no problems with visability and the gas mileage seems good so far.  I love it!
mini,cooper,2006,DH, 12/01/2006,Great Little Car!,4,"I bought the Mini base model in mid October '06 (red body and white roof) and it's been so much fun to drive!  It has great handling and solid steering, true to its BMW heritage and it really drives like a BMW!  Though only 115 hps, it does not feel under-powered if you know how to work a stick shift.  It is wonderful that the base Mini comes with Leatherette and not fabric since fabric covers eventually get all icky and can't be wiped down."
mini,cooper,2006,ohblackwater, 01/28/2007,Awesome Car!,5,"The MINI Cooper is an awesome car.  I have driven 8,500 miles in mine and I have averaged 32.2 mpg with mostly in town driving.  The power is good especially between 50 and 80 mph (I know that surprised me as well).  The fit and finish are perfect.  I'm very picky and I've owned this car for 6 months.  I have yet to find a SINGLE defect in the car.  I got the Premium and Sport packages.  I will absolutely buy another MINI product.  They're phenomenal quality and ""Oh My GOD"" fun to drive!  This car is a go cart!"
mini,cooper,2006,Stuart, 02/03/2007,Fun to Drive,4,"The Mini Cooper is roomier than most people think, so if you are considering one, sit in it. If you like to drive, this car is a blast. I thought that getting the automatic would reduce the fun, but it was for my wife and what she wanted. Living in the congested Portland, OR metro area, I have to say that it is the right choice. I do use the manual mode at times and can either maximize my fuel economy or power by shifting myself. We got the sport package with the 17"" wheels. The ride is a little rough, but we don't mind and the handling is great. Its fuel economy in mostly city driving has been around 19-21 MPG. The door locks stopped working on the first day, but after the switch panel was replaced we haven't had any issues."
mini,cooper,2006,harddo in florida, 02/10/2007,Great Fun in a Mini,4,I really enjoy this car.  I am a big guy and fit well in it.  The seat is a bit soft. The car is a hoot in traffic!  I love driving my Mini Cooper JCW convertible.  The top is always down!
mini,cooper,2006,AprilWhine, 02/26/2007,GP - From 0019 in the US,4,"This is my fourth MINI, not bad on a car only that has only been available in the US since 2002! I've loved them all, but the GP is really something special. From the sound of the supercharger winding up to the road hugging dynamics, it's the most fun to drive car I've ever owned. "
mini,cooper,2006,Robert, 03/10/2007,After a Year and a Half,5,"I really enjoy this car and I'm glad that I bought it.  I purchased the S model and added the moonroof, fog lamps and DSC.  The moonroof is outstanding, I like the DSC but if I didn't have the fog lamps, I wouldn't notice.  I haven't had any problems, but after 20,000 miles there are a few rattles and squeaks (particularly in the brakes on a cold day - the dealer told me that that was because of the brake pad composition).  Its gas mileage is good, even with having to buy premium gas (I just filled it today and spent $32 in NJ).  All in all, this car is still a blast to drive and I always get a question or two at the car wash about it.  I'm happy with my '06 Mini Cooper S!"
mini,cooper,2006,goldsbar, 04/26/2007,Annoyances Trump Fun,4,"I've owned several fun cars in my life and this one just doesn't measure up. The annoyances really got to me after a while. Not a lot of engine for the price. Run flats had horrible grip off the line. Tires chirped at the slightest provocation. Horrible gas mileage - low 20's - for the size of the car and power. Engine was annoying and very economy car like. Didn't give that ""I want to go faster"" feeling. Huge blindspot with the top up. Yes, it was fun to drive even at slow speeds which is important. Handling is very good but not great by any means. Better cars for the money out there!"
mini,cooper,2006,Sutton86, 05/02/2008,Zippy but chilly,4,"Cute, fun car to drive. You'll get lots of compliments! Good power and cornering. Great gas mileage. Visibility is poor when top is up; average when top is down. Roll bars stick up and ruin the line of the car. The Miata is superior for design and visibility. In fact, I miss my old Miata but needed more space."
mini,cooper,2006,katefromca, 05/19/2008,Fun looking but poor quality,3,"Owned the Mini for 2.5 years; in that time, had an oil leak, brake problems, steering wheel problems, and a dead battery. Good thing it comes with warranty and full maintenance!  It is a fun car to drive and people still gawk when seeing a Mini convertible. But, it is an extremely unreliable car and after awhile that does eat into the fun, even with free repairs and maintenance. Finally, traded it in for a not-so-fun but reliable and safe Subaru.  If you are considering this car, make sure your Mini dealership is close to where you live, you'll be visiting it often!"
mini,cooper,2006,KenK, 10/03/2020,More fun than it should be.,5,"Owned my 2006 since new.  It's still a blast to drive after 14 years.  If you buy the gen 1 try to buy 2005-2006 with a manual trans. Stay away from CVT models.  It's also best if you are decent DIY mechanic.  This will save you lots of money !  Keep current on the maintenance and replace all the known weak links as needed (look them up online) Cooling system parts, suspension bushings etc.  If you want a daily driver, this may not be a good choice, but it's a great second car or short distance commuter.
"
mini,cooper,2007,Kelly, 08/01/2015,Love and Loathe,2,"If you insist on buying a Mini, then buy a new Mini and the extended warranty.  The warranty will pay for itself after the first repair.  Be sure that you have support in your area in the form of a dealership or a garage that is known for working on Minis. (It is very difficult to find an independent garage that excels on Mini service and maintenance.)  Sell the car before the warranty ends.  If you keep it after the warranty expires, be ready to pay $1000 and up for each repair, and there will be numerous repairs, for example, the water pump (replaced 2x), thermostat housing, oil pan seal (replaced 2x), moonroof repairs, rear door latch (replaced 2x), cylinders misfiring, oil leaks, axle seal replacement, etc.)

I loved how the Mini Cooper looked and drove.  The handling, especially around corners, was amazing.  This car was truly enjoyable to drive.  For the size of the car, it had a lot more cargo space than expected.  I used the Mini for trips to warehouse stores like Sam's Club and Costco.  

I loathe the car, however, because of the cost to maintain and the frequency that it was in the shop being repaired.  This car is not reliable or practical in terms of cost and upkeep.  Due to the overall cost to purchase and maintain, I will never buy another Mini again.

mini,cooper,2007,scooterluv1, 07/03/2015,Mmmm... I got mixed feelings!,4,"Absolutely loved it the 1st year! The 2nd year, not so much ($3000.00 sunroof repair, timing belt issues, $700.00 brake job, $300.00 emission issues, etc.). The 3rd year, it's just okay... I still like the car, but am no longer in-love w/it; I'm actually thinking of trading it for a new age Chevy Camaro. I've owned at least 8 BMW's (& loved all for the most part) and I expected much much more a BMW product."
mini,cooper,2007,living_dino, 06/06/2011,Timing Chain / Tensioner,3,"I had owned a 2006 MINI Cooper S, and I was one of the first people to buy the second generation of New MINI.
I LOVE the performance and driving experience of both cars.
There are few cars on the road that offer such a great driving experience, with the kind of gas economy that they get.
The first generation MINI was flawless in all respects.
The second generation, at least my year, has a re-occurring timing chain issue.
The technicians keep chaining it up, one year it is the chair, the next it is the tensioner (actually twice), and they they tell me it was an oil leak from the timing chain cover.
I think there is a design flaw, and they won't admit it.
In 4 years, 5 repair incidents."

mini,cooper,2007,Bryan Parry, 03/01/2015,Don't Say You Weren't Warned,2,"Got sucked into the sporty performance and good look and then...

I owned a preowned MCS '07 w/ 39k on it for THREE MONTHS before selling.  Let me say that again THREE MONTHS. I experienced the following. Random Limp modes and stall outs in the middle of traffic. Timing Chain ""death rattle."" Carbon build up. Frozen throttle/ unable to start. Multiple engine misfires in cylinders 1 & 2. Inexplicable grinding into third gear (had a brand new clutch btw). Inexplicable problems with power locks including the hatch randomly opening itself. Cabin rattles. This car was clean and maintained right on schedule. I was the third owner. I finally threw in the towel and got a Mazda"
mini,cooper,2007,Casey B, 09/02/2018,2007 Mini Cooper S,2,"This car was a blast to drive, but spent more time in the repair shop than my driveway.   I bought it used from the dealer when it was 6 years old, and it only had 48k miles.  Based on service records and appearance, it had been well cared for by the previous owner.  I bought a warranty at time of purchase because I read online reviews indicating that reliability was spotty.  Sure enough, after I owned the car about a year and maybe 8k miles later, it needed a new engine due to oil starvation (I later learned that the turbo models consume about a quart of oil every 1k miles).  The engine repair was $7.5k, and my warranty covered about $5k.  However, that was after I threatened to sue the dealer and the warranty company for NOT wanting to cover the repair.  The dealer and warranty company initially told me that the warranty was null and void because the car had been modified (lowered a bit and an air intake added).   I then reminded the dealer that the car was exactly as they sold it to me, and it that was going to be an issue, they should have told me before selling me a third party warranty.   About 18 months later, it started making a rattling sound, and I spent over $2k replacing the parts that house the timing belt.   About a month ago, I took it in for an oil change, and to have some warning lights diagnosed (air bag, check engine light). Long story short, they listed another $4.5k in needed repairs, including a new air bag!    By this time, I only had $66k miles on it because it was just a weekend fun car.  I paid for the oil change and told the dealer I was done.   I literally handed the keys back and told them to keep the car and that I'd drop off the title in a few days.   They weren't surprised because this model year is problematic, and they've heard stories similar to mine before.  They did manage to find a wholesaler to buy it from me for $600, and I gladly accepted it.   Had it run properly, it would have sold for closer to $5k, but I just didn't care anymore, and the thought of taking it home that day made me ill.  So I left it and never looked back.

I ignored that warning sign because it was so cute and so fun to drive - big mistake. I loved that car and had it for 1 yr before I traded it in - too many problems to list but the last one was a recall. I knew from experience that Mini dealership would say it was something I did so I traded it in. They never covered anything - ever - it was always my fault. I spent over 2,000 bucks on it in a year. I love the car, always will but I can't afford the repairs. For a Mini car it has Major expenses, are you prepared to pay that price? I wasn't - driving a Toyota now and very very happy with it!"

After finding what I wanted, in my price range, I purchased a 2007 base hatchback with 49k miles.  The car was in super nice shape.  Mechanically it ran and drove excellent.  It has been an absolute blast to drive.  It gets some super fuel economy.  I was getting better than the average.  34.5 mpg combined.  Then the trouble started. Sun roof stuck open.  $1100 to install a used Sunroof just 5 days after I owned the car.  Dealer said this is Common?

mini,cooper,2007,rc_rasmussen, 12/05/2012,Do Not Ever Buy a Mini,2,"What a fun car to drive!!

What a horrible car to own!!

I've had nothing but maintenance issues with my mini.
It's too bad really, cuz I was such a huge fan for the first 2yrs I owned the car.
Since then though, never again.

I've had all the same issues with the timing chain and tensioner, up to the climax when I was told I would need a new engine at 86k miles.
Cost 8000$.
Mini agreed to help pay for 0!!
I'm now at 98k and the engine has started to seize.
I was extremely dilligent in maintenance.


Other issues include airbag sensors breaking, replacing a water pump at 52k - cost : 1400$.

The kicker - I just finished paying it off 3 months ago....

Save yourself the 24k$"
mini,cooper,2007,CTMINICOOPER, 01/23/2016,Buyer Beware,1,"I would not recommend MINI Cooper brand.  I reside in CT and the brand is not reliable and the maintenance cost is absurd, unless money is not a concern for you.  The cost and reliability will trump the fun after the warranty expires.

If you live in CT or state similar to CT (climate and roads), if the vehicle will be your sole / primary car, if you want to own it for more than three years, then I would recommend against a Mini Cooper.  Based on friends, colleagues, and me, you should research and listen to others who have lived the experience.  Your pockets and frustrations will be felt more than the fun in driving it.  Headquarters and dealerships do not take ownership of their brand, even when 200,000 of their vehicles have the same issues.  Do the deep research and you will find the consistent issues with this brand.

Based on articles and other owner's experience, the above continues to be an issue.  Mini ranks at the bottom of reliability; however, at the top for repair cost through a life of a vehicle.

The technician said that the parts how that there was a problem for a while, judging the wear marks on certain parts. He also said that timing chains only last 30 or 40k miles. Don't buy a Mini. If you own one sell it before the timing chain breaks and screws up the internal parts such that the engine has to be replaced to the tune of $8,000. Dumb design, I was a dummy for buying it."

 Since I purchased it the driver's side door locking mechanism fell apart, the tensioner has been replaced 2 times, the timing chain replaced, the water pump replaced, the air intake hose & clamps replaced , & the air conditioner fan motor replaced.

mini,cooper,2007,Annoyomos, 12/29/2015,This car was a nightmare!,1,"This is the worse car I've ever had!  A MINI Cooper Convertible 2007 standard version and  I was so excited when I first purchased this car. I felt like a celebrity because kids would run up to it and hug it.  I just loved the way the wind felt against my hair as I drove with the top down. We all know this car kills you with cuteness. Don't be blinded by its adorable exterior its a super sensitive money eating machine. The first year the dash board was lit up with issues. The first two years I drove a loaner and Mini Cooper employees knew my face very well and I should of moved right in.
 Anyway this car has steering wheel issues that will cost you thousands of dollars to fix it. An airbag recall that Mini will repair but leave you to any other airbag related issue ( dashboard lighting ) that's probably related to the stupid recall but they want you to pay for it. I had plugin problems with the cooling system what ever that means.. The car would be shut off and it would sound like its still on trying to cool off.
One issues that drove me crazy was you cant bring this car to any mechanic because this is a foreign car they have no clue what to do with your car. I've had mechanics break parts on the car doing a simple oil change or changing the brake light( broke trunk light by leaning on it during a repair) so I was a slave to MINI cooper. I couldn't take it anywhere else which is super annoying. MINI isn't trustworthy either though. I went in and asked them to check my engine because the light was one. I specifically asked them to check my fluids. They didn't and later my car over heated and was smoking everywhere. They came and served it but I was a scared mess after the experience. They apologize but constantly repeat the same screw-ups due to lack of communication with the mechanics and service reps.
 Overall I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone and if you want to spend money on two cars to keep one cute one go ahead.. I drove around anxious all the time worrying about what light will come on next and how many thousands of dollars will cost me when the next light comes on. Not away to live

Bad automatic transmissions.
Bad clutches.
Bad vacuum pumps that can cause the need for a complete engine review.
And the problems I've had: death rattle dieseling.
It's a noise the engine makes on start up.
You can find countless posts on Mini forums on this issue.
The noise is a symtom of the timing chain and tensioner failing.
It usually just costs $1,550 to fix, but the change can jump timing or break causing the valves to contact the pistons and the need for a $8,000 engine replacement.
My was replaced at 20,000 miles and now again at under 70,000 miles.

In all I've dumped $2300 into it since I got it a year ago. Thankfully I bought a warranty, doesn't cover everything though.

The car ran great for about another 3 weeks and now the motor knocks badly and it needs a timing chain according to the service department. Also the transmission has a slow leak. I am terrified about when the factory warranty is up. Mini made a huge mistake in my opinion by letting BMW take control of the motors.

I do wish they had put an opaque screen on the sunroof as the Virginia summers get boiling hot, but the auto down windows on the remote helps that some.  Drinks in the cup holders tend to unintentionally turn on the seat heaters too.  "
mini,cooper,2007,Nelson, 03/31/2010,2007 Mini Cooper S aluminum block,3,"My daughter bought me this car because I am poor. With this car, I am poorer. Plus, the local mechanic can't fix it and the dealer is two hours away. In fact, I took it to the dealer for cold start problems, and they could not fix it or even find the problem. Either fuel pump or carbon on valves. How can a car with less than 50,000 miles have carbon build up? And this is evidently common, perhaps a congenital defect. Also the normal maintenance, for example, the tires, is every 25,000 miles and costs $800 for horrid run flats. This car is not for one without disposable income and need for reliability. "
mini,cooper,2007,aburg, 02/17/2012,Lots of Fun for the Enthusiast,4,"Bought our S 6spd used in 2010 with 28k on the clock.
We chose a Mini S because we wanted something that got decent MPG was fun to drive and was a little different.
It has fulfilled all of those things and we are extremely happy with it.


We knew that buying a Civic or Corolla would probably be cheaper and more reliable but it would also be a lot more boring.
The Mini has been in the shop now and again but we knew it would probably take some up keep going in.
We bought our Mini used, it still had some factory warranty on it and we added an extended warranty ($1,800) which has turned out to be useful."
mini,cooper,2007,ndmyr, 08/14/2007,Mixed experience,4,"This is a great performing car, but mine has been in the shop more than I have driven it.  DSC and brake warning light is on constantly and DSC doesn't work.  My windshield wipers also come on by themselves after I turn the car off which is very irritating. The dealer says the electronic control part is  on ""national order"" status from Mini in Germany which leads me to believe that there must be a lot of other owners with the same problem.  I'll have to wait and see if this car can outperform the Toyotas I have owned in the past.  I also wish I had the leather seats - the ""leatherette"" plastic seats make you sweat like crazy and feel cheap relative to the cost of the car.  Avoid them."

mini,cooper,2007,oliveb, 12/23/2011,Fun to drive when not being fixed,3,"I bought my 2007 MC used with 24,000 miles. It was the perfect first car for me -- small, easy to park, fun to drive. However, around 50,000 miles the car's reliability took a turn. This year it was in for service 7 times, towed twice. Everything from steering wheel locks to o2 sensors has needed to be replaced. It has started to overheat, and make discontenting sounds. Alignment pins have started rattling (not covered in warranty - $700 to fix). After a recent service trip the service light was at 10,000 miles and two weeks later its at 7,000 - no possible way I drove 3k in two weeks. 
My mom and sister both have brand new minis and love them, so perhaps this is a car not to be bought used."
mini,cooper,2007,S_Car_Go, 07/26/2009,23 Years of BMW,3,"Between my husband and I we've owned a BMW product since 1986. The Mini is truly a BMW and comes with all the benefits and the drawbacks.  BMW is all about what's under the hood - great engine, handling and braking.  BMW really doesn't care if your drink fits in the cupholder of if the interior uses materials that makes it look worse than an econo box.  After all, you're having too much fun driving to notice!  If it's anything like our other BMWs, expect that each visit to the mechanic will be about $1,000 - it will happen enough to be painful but not enough to hate the car.  Go to a Mini car club dinner (yes, you women too) to meet other owners and find out the best mechanics, body shop etc"

We have only 45,000 miles on the car and we have already replaced the tires twice, replaced door locks that broke, and now we need a new turbo and a valve job. They claim it's because we don't change the oil often enough but it's funny that they don't tell you this when you buy the car, they don't tell you this when you bring it in, and they don't contact you (like almost every other high quality car manufacturer) when you are due for maintenance.

However, my wife and I were discussing our dilemma last night deciding whether to pay the $1800 to repair rear gasket oil leak or trade it in. Now that we are out of warranty it looks like she'll be going. During first 50000 miles had fuel pump issue oxygen sensor,and numerous other problems.

I average 45 mpg, sometimes more, sometimes less depending on driving conditions, but I haven't gotten less than 41. The controls did take some getting used to, but that's just one more thing that makes this car unique. It is surprisingly roomy. I got a pretty basic model and it is still loaded with lots of nice features that most other cars only offer as ""added features"". I bought this car just as a work car that would be cheap on gas, but its so fun to drive that I drive it everywhere. My other vehicles are just collecting dust."

As above having to drive 2 hours for service and then also for the oil change and then the service light came on again and when we went in for the computer read NOTHING needed to be done, wasted trip.  Everytime one of the parts needed replacing the mgr. of the service dept said oh yes, we've had problems with that part.  When will it end??

I have taken numerous 1500 mile round trips with 35+ mpg @ 75-80 mph. The Mini rides well on the smooth interstates, but lousy roads in the northeast can beat you up a little; I guess a combination of the short wheelbase, run-flats, and inordinately high tire pressures. Overall though, the experience has been a good one so far. One other thing, no matter how many seats are physically in the car, the car is a two-seater.  "

Borla exhaust is a little loud on extended trips. A few body fit problems noted and as yet dealer has not been able to fix. A couple of quality issues that you would not expect on a BMW product. One of the key remotes did not work-had to be replaced by dealer. Line to boost gauge pulled loose triggering all kinds of engine warnings. The car is fully loaded with all options so lots of fun things to play with. Performance and looks are real highpoints.  Electric top has a few quirks but generally works very well.

When the turbo kicks in, it flies. I wanted to get a Solstice but was disappointed with its poor visibility and interior quality. For less money I got the Mini and have not regretted it. It handles just like a go cart, has good visability, feels safe, and the interior is beautiful. The electronic displays are all programmable, including allowing you to call up a speedo in the center of the tach (infront of the wheel).

Didn't feel I needed the MINI Cooper S and I am perfectly fine with the base MINI. I have been averaging 28 MPG (city driving only) since I have yet to have him (MINI MAC) out on the open road. Oh yes, you will name him or her since it becomes so personalized and full of character. MINI MAC loves the curves and getting the attention he deserves on and of the road.

But worrying: From day 3 check engine light came on intermittently-gas cap issues, it seems- then went away. It went on again yesterday (1100 miles) when tank got low so that was ok. But it's fun to drive and I'm not even into cars (I thought.) It's like a go cart but feels super  safe and you don't feel small.

While it lacks the punch of the Cooper S, it still has quite acceptable acceleration if you are in the appropriate RPM range. I happened to acquire one with the 6-speed auto transmission.  If you include the sport mode, there are six different operational settings for the tranny, and there is a learning curve to figure them all out. I usually drive in manumatic/steptronic mode with the heavier steering of the sport mode enabled.  The paddles on the steering wheel are especially convenient, and I do not miss a clutch pedal in heavy stop and go traffic.  The wheels are on the corners, which makes for wickedly fun cornering!"

Leatherette seats make you sweat & the doors won't stay open. The cup holders are not usable, except the one in the back & the arm rest is in the way of that one. It drives fun when you go fast but in the city with stop & go traffic, it jumps a lot. Not sure if that's normal, but the dealership assures me that it is. It's been in the shop 2x since I've gotten it, the first time b/c my check engine light came on & I asked them to check the ""jumpyness"". They reset the computer & replaced recalled parts but then it became really jumpy & was smoking. Got it back today."

The ride in the S is much more comfortable now that the Sport Suspension is an option and not a standard (back-breaking) feature. But I have had some weird things happen with the factory- installed iPod adapter, and sometimes the NAV screen just blanks. The dealer can't find anything wrong with it.  The run flats roar on the highway, but replacing them made the ride quieter.  Visibility is an issue: other moron drivers have plowed into my lane on 4 occasions. Luckily I was able to avoid them, but it's still scary. Finally, this is definitely a single person car; any more than 2 people and it's a tight fit for stuff."

Driving it is arouses the limbic brain ( limbic brain is the primitve centre of the brain that makes you prick up your ears whe you are half a sleep and you here a noise in the house.)

First, the speedometer is off over 5 mph at 75 mph, the speedometer reads 80 mph when I am going 75 mph. I called Mini and they said that this was within design specs and they wouldn't and couldn't make the speedometer accurate. The other problem is with the road noise. It is difficult to talk on a cell phone at highway speeds. If they would fix these two issues and offer better customer service it would be a great car."

Speaking of maintenance, I haven't needed any.  Nothing. Nada. I have almost 12K miles on the car, and the coputer says it will be another year before it will need its first service. That said, we started shopping around for a larger vehicle because we're adding to our family, and the prices we're being quote for trade in are near ridiculous. $22K trade value in for a $34K car?

I usually have my cell phone in one of the cup holders which is handy.  Cornering is fun, tight, no sway. No problem in traffic, visibility is great, power to get out of anyones way or away from traffic is supreme. I've got a roof rack on my MINI.

Neither powerful nor fastest but it is quick, agile, solid and builds confidence even at high speeds on irregular pavements and curves never fails to give feedback to the driver.

My windshield has 3 stone chips and 2 big cracks due to stone hits & the high windshield angle. Engine has cold idle issue where it sounds like a diesel truck for 1-3 minutes.

My sunroof won't open when its really hot.  I have it in the shop twice to get lights replaced and two other times for minor issues.  The seats are great for short trips since they hug you in the seat...but for long trips my lower back aches terribly.  Also, the center console opens on its own by merely brushing it with my arm, needs a better closing mechanism.  The sunroom screen doesn't block enough sun."

I LOVE to drive it, but I've had several issues with the turbo engine, mostly the turbo itself.  It's been replaced twice and I also had to have the valve cover replaced, all under warranty. This is my third Mini, first was an '02 Cooper. Second was an '05 S with the supercharged engine, which I had NO problems with.  I would probably still have that one, but a drunk driver took care of that for me!  If I were to do it again, I would stick with the base Cooper, unless they bring back the supercharger.  Was much more reliable.  On top of that, the closest dealer is a 90-minite drive away."

Cons: the tires wear out extremely fast. I seriously have to rotate and get two new tires at least twice a year. I don't understand why they wear so fast, since I'm not a crazy driver and have low milage. I feel like my car turns on maintenance lights fairly often, even though it is never turns out to be serious ( airbag, check engine ) Also, after about and hour and a half the seats get very uncomfortable.

Everything about the car is great: a bicycle fits in the back, it gets great gas mileage, and the overall feel of the car is exceptional. Except...the engine malfunction light came on at 340 miles and it has been in the shop ever since. Mini U.S. and Mini Germany have no idea how to fix it at this point. I am told that it has been joined by another 2007 with the same problem at 380 miles.  I would suggest that you avoid buying a 2007 at this point and give them time to work out the bugs if you feel you must have this car."
mini,cooper,2007,DCroft, 04/03/2007,This is a great little car!,5,"I've only had it a week so the reliability rating may be bogus but this is the most fun you can have on four wheels. I find myself looking for twisty, winding roads. It is relatively inexpensive to buy and extrememly economical to drive. All that and a fast, very nimble drive as well! I couldn't be happier (but wait till next week...)  "
mini,cooper,2007,Ollie, 04/07/2007,Just got it,5,"Went and bought a 2007 turbo S model. It's a fun car to drive. Bought it for the gas mileage, and I am not dissappointed. Turbo performance is awesome. Just have to get used to a smaller vehicle. Only problem so far is cd player doesn't work. At some point I'll have to take it in, but it's a 130 mile drive to get there. Dealers are few and far between."
mini,cooper,2007,jlevy, 04/11/2007,Just had the car for a month or two,4,"I've got a minimally optioned Cooper S (LSD, HID lights, arm rest, 16"" wheels, no sport suspension). The handling of the car is very good. It reminds me of an MR-2 I used to have and is much more responsive than the WRX I traded for it. It's just plain fun to drive. Torque steer and the LSD can conspire to twist the wheel a little - use two hands. Power from the 1.6 turbo motor is very nice - not as fast as the WRX I traded (Cobb stg 3), but very useable low end torque and nicely spaced ratios in the manual 6 speed trans."
mini,cooper,2007,Lovingit, 04/10/2007,Greatcar,4,"The new '07 Mini is much improved over the last one. Just got one of the first six speed manuals. The car drives great and has significantly more performace than the previous base model. Performance could be better, but then they wouldn't have a reason to charge more for the S. Overall, the car is a joy. The sport seats are comfortable, easy and specific configuration options enables you to get exactly what you want.  The car gets a great deal of attention and is just plain fun.  I would highly reccomend this car to those who want something different and individual."
mini,cooper,2007,graphicjoe, 05/09/2007,I love it!,5,"I've almost reached the break in mileage so I have not really pushed the car to its limits as yet. But it has great handling in all areas, a lot of grunt for a 1600 cc car, and good mileage. I like the jumbo speedo. The unusual placement of controls that receives lots of complaints isn't a problem for an owner. If you drive the car frequently the control placement becames natural. For my needs it is almost perfect.  "
mini,cooper,2007,mlg2ca, 07/02/2007,MINI spells F-U-N,5,"Bought the car about 2 months ago and never had so much fun driving. I am taking  long way to work and making detours! This car is both sporty and eco-friendly. The turbo provides wonderful torque in the twisties yet is economical to drive on the highway in 6th. As some teenagers that walked by my house put it, 'This is a sick ride man !'."
mini,cooper,2007,Dissappointed, 06/10/2007,Mini nightmare,3,"This is not going to be your normal review since, though I've owned this car for just 2 months now, I've actually only had it in my possession for half a day and have only driven it 15 miles. Why?  Because it keeps having problems which the dealer either can't identify or fix, and which Mini seems to care nothing about since they seem to have a problem sending parts to repair what they find wrong.  My ratings are based on the 15 miles I drove the car. The problems seem to have started when they forgot to remove the gas tank vent plugs on arrival.  But after replacement of the entire fuel system it's still having problems.  Yes, it's a lemon and in frustration I've asked for my money back."
mini,cooper,2007,leapinlizz, 06/19/2007,Unexpectedly Roomy inside,4,"Have owned my Mini for three months now. It gets a lot of attention and questions from curious people. People even roll down their windows and ask questions when I'm sitting in traffic. Can't believe how smooth and fast the car accelerates.  Torque steer on this car can be a little scary if you punch it hard. Very comfy for two people. Great on gas, averaging 32 MPG with combined city/highway and can go almost 400 miles on one tank. Had a Murano try to follow me through the twisty bits a couple weeks ago. That was funny. The ride can be a little harsh over bumps and is probably not for everyone. Probably the most irritating thing about this car is having traffic in front of you. "
mini,cooper,2007,blueguydotcom, 06/28/2007,Fun car with a few minor flaws,3,"Every morning I look forward to driving my Cooper S. The turbo engine's relatively smooth and eager to rev. With a pretty tight suspension on the car, it seems to swallow most corners with ease. The small exterior dimensions hide a surprisingly roomy interior. I've transported 4 adults in my car without complaint.  Fold down rear seats also make the car pretty good at transporting groceries/gear from Costco.  Finally, the car nets an astounding 35 mpg for me on the freeway and I get about 30 mpg combined.  FWD robs the car of fun though. Until I start a family, the Cooper will meet my needs - small, fun, economical, zippy and easy to maneuver in any environment - it's a perfect urban car."
mini,cooper,2007,cj, 07/05/2007,Joy! Utter Joy!,5,"I traded in my BMW X3 for the Cooper S. I got so much more than fuel efficiency, which was my initial goal. I totally pimped it out! It is a joy to drive and it is solid! I was amazed at how well it is built and how solid it feels. BMW got it right! The turbo is quick, seamless and no turbo lag. The sound system is killer. The ""bun warmer"" seats are toasty on those chilly Colorado evenings when I like to drive with the ""way cool"" double moonroof opened to the max. The styling makes me smile when I drive it and others smile when I cruise by. It corners like a dream. My husband is 6'4"" and loves this car. He has a brand new BMW 328XI and I can't get him to leave my MINI alone! "

Yesterday, at 1171 miles, it began 'jumping'. I am no car expert and the best way to describe the problem is like when driving a stick and you dont change gears properly. Needless to say it will be going back to dealer as soon as we can get it there."

Not quick without sportmode on, sometimes its annoying trying to pass others in traffic. My problem with the car is the arm rest. first of all its a option and even with it inside its low and very un omfortable. Maybe it's because I didnt get leather seats? Other than that car is solid.

Sure you can find a car that beats the MINI in a few areas but you can't find any car at any price that does all the things as well as the MINI does. It's worth the extra money you may need to pay for it. So far..."
mini,cooper,2007,speed, 11/09/2007,Speedometer faulty,4,"I really enjoy driving this vehicle but there are some serious deficiency's that would prevent me from buying another Mini. The first is the road noise. Mini really needs to reduce the road noise, its so loud that at highway speeds its difficult to talk on my cell phone. Another significant problem is the speedometer, when I am going 75 mph the speedometer in the Mini reads 81 mph. I called Mini and they said that it is within design specs and they could not and would not fix the speedometer. This sloppiness in performance and the unwillingness of Mini to take care of the problem makes me wonder about Mini's integrity. I don't think it's too much to ask that the speedometer be accurate."
mini,cooper,2007,jterry, 12/03/2007,"Good, fun car.",4,I've had my MINI for a couple of months now and have put about 2000 miles on it. This car makes driving an enjoyable activity. The gas mileage is great and the front seat is suprisingly roomy. Can't say the same for the back.

Now, that's an endorsement."
mini,cooper,2007,Nick, 03/20/2008,Gotta love it!,5,"I bought this as my first ever new car. Within seconds of pushing the start button I was grinning ear to ear, and it hasn't stopped since. The fun factor of this car is off the charts. I have a feeling those who buy a Mini want a car that makes their heart race a little every time they sit in it.  It drives and handles like a dream.  I decided to go for the S package and get the better performance and pay more for that instead of paying for leather seats and an upgraded interior.  I'm glad I did as the interior is already pretty nice in it's stock form. Overall it's a great car.  There's ample room inside. In fact I can fit my skis inside instead of on the roof."
mini,cooper,2007,mini love, 03/20/2008,My forever car,5,"I did a lot of homework on this car, selected what I wanted and have no regrets.  The weather outside is not an issue with this car.  (and this Chicago winter has been nonstop). Be sure to get the heated seats!)  Mileage is good, handling is superb, and very precise. I have the upgraded radio and have  rear dimming mirror, which are a must. xenon headlights are perfect for night driving.  since you are going to purchase this car, go for the color and interiors that make you happy. Keep it clean, and it will remain looking brand new. Have had no problems for the 6 mos. I've owned it, just lots of onlookers, smiles, waves, and questions from curious people and other Mini drivers. Go for it!"
mini,cooper,2007,Fun but poisoned, 04/25/2008,Fun but poisoned,4,"This car should win the Bang for the Buck contest.  It is a performer that is easy on the gas.  0-60mph under 7 seconds and gets 30 mpg city/highway.  There is no other car that can match the performance and the fuel efficiency of the new MINI Cooper S.  But the engine makes loud noises like a diesel truck.  On some occasions, it is worse as if it is grinding on some internal metal parts.  Dealer has not found the solution yet.  I have my fingers crossed that the MINI company will find a permanent cure for this problem.  The car rattles sometimes.  Handling is second to none."

mini,cooper,2008,bill_jones, 06/14/2014,"Too many problems, excessive oil consumption",3,"I owned a 2008 Mini Cooper S, until recently when I traded it in with 75,000 miles. I bought it new and it was a fun car to drive.
It had lots of leg room for my 6' 4"" body, but in terms of maintainability it was the worst car that I have ever owned. After 36,000 miles, I was continually plagued with either a ""CHECK ENGINE"" or ""SERVICE"" light and as a result I was forced to bring it to the dealer/car repair shop to get it analyzed. Furthermore, it had ""run flat"" tires...a terrible experience!
To summarize my MINI experience:
after 50,000 miles it turned into a lemon. To the future owner...stock up on SYN 5W-30 motor oil...you're going to need it! "

If you are reading this and other posts you should have an idea now that the Mini is a blast to drive. And you will pay and pay for the constant repairs to enjoy that go-kart feel. The reliability on these cars is abysmal - period. Something is always leaking, breaking or needs replacing. The little turbo simply just eats things up and you will be in the ""repair"" tunnel of hell once things go south. And they will sooner then later. I simply can't recommend these cars until BMW makes a significant commitment to improving quality. Save yourself heartache and go get a new Mazda Miata.

Noisy on highway, base engine strains when pushed. Automatic trans is clunky on downshifts and has trouble making decisions. This car had some type of solenoid problem before I bought it and found that out later. Very finicky about fuel- Mini will almost spit out anything less than 93 octane. Carbon buildup problems exist and on such a tightly built engine, that becomes worrisome. The Mini, for me, is like someone that you just date but wouldn't marry."

mini,cooper,2008,stanley m heath, 06/11/2016,a blissful honeymoon led to a nasty divorce,1,"BMW seems determined to make Mini owners tethered to their Mini dealership service departments. There are no instructions for owner maintainence and the instructions for resetting the stupid computer for things as simple as inflating the tires are either incomplete or unintelligible. Oil change intervals of 15,000 miles are too long and only contribute to more trips to the dealer in the long run as the engine wears out. Every Mini owner can attest to the utter worthlessness of the run flat tires. Harsh ride and expensive to replace I put conventional radials on and it made big improvement. For a ""sports"" car with all the electronics I""d expect and oil pressure gauge and a temperature gauge at the minimum, but apparently BMW engineers knew better. I bought my Cooper S with 13,000 miles and never got the Email regarding the recall for timing belt tensioner replacement until mine imploded at 30,000 miles. The local dealer was willing to replace mine, but up until that moment I'd never had oil consumption problems. Since then it burned through 2 qts. in 5000 miles. Coincidence? I think the fragments from the tensioner ruined the internal parts of the engine. The driving experience is indeed exhilarating, but beware the dealer cost for service can offset the fun factor real quick. I will not buy another Mini or any other BMW product or recommend them to anyone else. Run the other way

By the way, the title refers to a carnival ride, ""The Wild Maus.""  It would snap your head off your shoulders, if you weren't careful.

mini,cooper,2008,Exhausted Mini Owner, 09/20/2016,"Don't Drive Away With This Car, Run From It!!!",1,"So, when I was in the market for a new car, a Mini Cooper S Convertible caught my eye.  I have always liked Minis, and this car fit my personality to a 'T' (or so I thought).  All was well, for about a month.  I took it to the shop after I bought it to have them look over an issue I was having with brakes squeaking.  I need new front brakes; also, there were about $3000 worth of repairs that my car needed because I had holes in my oil line, and all other types of issues.  This took me two trips to the dealership to get all of these taken care of.  We will consider those my fault for buying a lemon, without taking it to the dealership before buying it.  With those repairs out of the way, over the next two years I have taken my Mini to the dealership over a dozen times.  I have had the wiring fixed, I have had a new throttle body installed, I have had to have the entire front end realigned and fixed because rain was just coming right into my convertible top, and had this weird possession episode where my tachometer was telling the rest of my lights and functions to freak out and come on at random.  I breaks down at random, and then will work for a couple of weeks, only for the issue to come up again, or another one to rear its ugly head.  I purchased my car in Jan 2014, it is now Sep 2016, I have paid for my car more than twice now!!!!!  Don't walk, run, run far far far away from this car.  The times it does work, I love it, it is so fun to drive.  But, if you are the type of person that wants to know if you are going to make if from point A to B...ever, don't buy it.

However shortly after I picked up the car the problems started; engine overheating, windows not rolling up, various engine lights coming on, etc...  Each time the dealer would help me resolve the issue, but as this wasn't scheduled maintenance, I had to arrange alternative transportation.  In addition we live about an hour from the dealer so it was two hours of driving with my wife following me.  This wouldn't have been such a big deal if it wasn't in the shop at least once a month.

mini,cooper,2008,CourtneyEC, 10/09/2018,Great car if you’re financially comfortable enough,4,"This is a really fun car, deceptively comfortable for one so small, great for collecting speeding tickets. Has great field of vision around it. Plenty of storage space if you put the back seats down, I’ve moved with it a few times. Back seats are cramped and the seats themselves are uncomfortable, front are just fine. The seats are pretty durable and clean up nicely after minor spills. Has a lot of customization you can do with the read outs though they are often obscured by warning lights. You get used to the big odometer in the middle of the car. The front end of the car is very low and prone to getting torn off if you park too close to a concrete curb, you learn to park far back in a space. I hate the sunroof Which takes up the front and back area of the ceiling and comes with a purposeless mesh cover, but that’s just because it’s impractical in Vegas and only serves to expose the top of your head to the sun while you drive. If you like sunroofs it’s a pretty big one. It has stopped working though recently, which most I ever did with was crack it for ventilation while parked. The gas indicator is different from most cars, visualized in pie slices. Once it gets down to three the car may run empty at any moment. The downside is that the car is expensive to maintain. My dad bought this used in 2011 as a midlife crisis mobile and I ended up with it in 2013. In that time the timing chain snapped, requiring the whole engine be replaced. Then a few months later some plastic part in the engine deformed from heat (I live in Las Vegas, I think it’d been 115 that day) and had to be replaced. Oil changes are $60 to $100, though supposedly only needed once a year. Currently at 122000 some miles it’s just had to have completely new brake pads, replaced water pump, Persistent antifreeze leak that the mechanic is currently trying to fix, all of which has cost more than a third of the car’s worth at this point. That’s not to mention the several sensors that have gone bad so constantly say something is wrong with the tires, seatbelts, and brakes even though they’re fine. I don’t bother fixing those. This model (or all Minis?) have a lot of plastic parts inside that I don’t think hold up well to the dry heat in Vegas. The check engine light has been on for most of the life of the car, with one thing or another wrong with it at any given time. It’s been a good car, comparatively good on gas mileage, but the upkeep is a bit beyond what is practical On a student’s limited funds. Would make a great passion car though, something fun and comfortable for someone that can afford the repairs and has a garage to shield it from the sun. Not sad I’ve had it, just sad it hasn’t been more durable. Then again, 7 years in the family putting up with longer commutes, a climate I don’t think it was designed for, and persistent minimal maintenance (getting it fixed when we can afford or when absolutely urgent) I’d still says it’s been a good car for the price. This round of repairs may hold it for another 60 or 80000 miles, but planning to sell it and go electric when I get the money saved up.

mini,cooper,2008,EastCoastGirl, 11/02/2009,MINI Review,4,"I have had my 2008 MINI Cooper S for a year and half with zero issues.  I have only had to have one part replaced on my coop - the recalled exhaust.  (The tail-pipes were too long and were a burn hazard for the legs.)  I love love LOVE to drive MINI's and can't imagine owning any other car. They handle well, have pep and are cute to boot! "
mini,cooper,2008,Not quite sure, 12/24/2009,Not quite sure how I feel,4,"I bought my MiniS because I wanted better gas mileage, but so far I've had 3 flats and one shattered windshild from a stone on the fwy so it hasn't been all that economical.  Also, the dealer added $3000 to the MSR b/c ""they are so much in demand.""  Well, now they're not in demand and I paid quite a bit more than I should have.  Also, I'm a little afraid to take it on long trips b/c I always seem to come back needing a new tire.  Yeah, I do get lots of compliments like ""You're car looks like it's smiling at you!"" Or, ""you've got a cutie!"" That's nice, but I'm seriously thinking of trading it for a RAV 4-- more room, better tires, more comfortable on long trips."
mini,cooper,2008,Mike, 07/17/2010,This car is garbage,3,"I bought my 2008 Mini brand new as I wanted a fun car to drive.  I have been to the dealer for fixing things so often I am now on a first name basis with them.  It's no one big thing, but a bunch of little things.  Windows don't work properly, engine indication lights come on randomly, I needed a new valve cover gasket at 28,000 km and since getting the car back from the dealer, it sounds like a diesel.  I tried to get it back in right away, but was told that I have to wait three weeks, likely causing further damage.  I don't care if the repairs are fixed under warranty.  It's the hassle of taking time from my day and having to continuously take the car in that is driving me nuts."
mini,cooper,2008,wildmini, 08/27/2013,"Mini now, Maxi$$$$ later. Horrible resale value!",3,"My 08 Cooper S (6 speed auto) ran at 226 Degrees.
The Thermostat is computer controlled and works to keep the temperature HOT.
In turn, this cokes up the oil in the Turbo models, and causes a lot of build up in the engine from carbon.

I found my Turbo model had excellent fuel economy until you factor in the amount of High-Quality synthetic motor oil I had to constantly replace.
People try to say their Mini doesn't use oil, just look at the exhaust pipe on any of them, they use plenty of oil.


I sold mine at 77K after a series of replacements.
Heat kills & every trip is a risk after you get significant mileage on these."
mini,cooper,2008,dan, 03/20/2009,dont waste your money,3,"we bought this to fast ,it is very small inside and hard to get to anything in the back after  only 6 months the dealer will only give us 19,000 trade for a 33,800 loaded mini , they told us the mini was hard to get and has a good resale value ,these were just lies to get us to buy the car if you dont mind a bumpy ride,no room inside ,or want to loose 15,000 on your car in 6 months than this is the car for you ,i learned my lesson the hard way , hope this helps you ."
mini,cooper,2008,mini coop, 09/11/2010,Great Car,4,"Has been virtually trouble free and I have 48,000 miles on the car in two years. I am 6'5"" tall and it is very comfortable..tons of room. My 6'6"" son can sit in the back seat behind my wife on the passenger side. We can fit 5-6 bags of grocery even with four in the car. It accelerates very well with 4 in the car even up hills. Ride is firm but has no rattles. The six speed manual is smooth and the engine improves with mileage. I like it better now than when I got it...smoother and quicker. Still gets tons of looks and comments. People pull up asking me roll down my window to say the car is great. Nothing performs as well for the money and 40+ MPG. Great in snow and cold. Strong heater.  "
mini,cooper,2008,MINI S POCKET ROCKET, 11/12/2010,Go GO Cart GO!,4,"This is a blast to drive, there is no other way to describe this little Pocket Rocket!! Fast tight  steering, just out and out fun to drive. I Have had many types of cars in my life over the years from Jags and Vettes to Mercedes and the like. The most fun car to drive ever. The radio is kind of lacking how ever should have bought the Better radio option!"
mini,cooper,2008,kongsi, 05/13/2013,Did I buy the right car,4,"Well I was looking for a bigger car , but saw this MINI at BMW of Dallas and fell in love with it.
I was surprised , how good the service was when I bought it , this Ali really went out of his way to help me choose the right car.Then usually I feel the car gets lesser as the time of purchase goes by , but they upgraded the car to certificated the car and replaced things that were getting worn , like the run flat tires.
The car is a blast to drive ,the only thing IÂ´m not sure of how hard the ride is and how loud the road noise is. It can wear me out .
The price is a little high ,because some things are so much plastic , but there are allot of features on it ."
mini,cooper,2008,JT, 06/16/2008,Excellent Engineering,4,"Been driving about a month now in by base mini hardtop.  Great car! Fun to drive. Sticks to the road.  42 mpg highway!  Great engineering. Tons of room for pilot and passenger.  Every feature thought through. The engine will stay on to ensure the car cools down, even if you shut it off. Hold the unlock button down on the remote and the windows go down and sunroof resets to vent. Standard sport button resets steering and gear ratio for more feel of the road.  Very impressed. What other 40+ mpg car inspires you to get in every day? "
mini,cooper,2008,Ian Venieris, 08/08/2008,Cute but rough.,2,"Cute looks, good handling and the new for 2007 BMW engine with Peugeot parentage caused me to buy the 2008 Cooper S with the 6-speed transmission. Having driven the automatic I do not recommend it as it does not allow for the fuel economical 6th gear when in sport mode. The car is plagued by multitude of gremlins which in my case caused it to spend 28 out of the first 60 days at the dealership's service department. 1200 miles out of a total of 2000 miles driven were for transport to and from the dealership. If one decides that this is the only car in which they can be happy, I suggest interviewing the dealership to identify their service competency but few areas have more than one dealer."
mini,cooper,2008,Apple, 09/14/2008,Apple of My Eye,5,"The MPG is amazing, I was coming from a 2003 MC, and I have been getting 40.1 MPG with the AC on. It does handle like a gocart, and is very stable at 95+ MPH. Love the look and for me the Navi is a must. You can't beat the price or features. Oh did I mention MPG!"
mini,cooper,2008,Marcel, 10/16/2008,'08 Cooper Convertible,4,"If I was going to buy an economical car, then I wanted a car that is fun to drive. The Cooper convertible is just that. Currently at 34 mpg around town and the 5-spd. is perfect for this car. The car is perfect except for the blind spot when the top is up. This is the rear quarter area, behind the back seat. Tough to see when backing up - however the rear sensors are helpful.  "
mini,cooper,2008,TPAMiniGuy, 05/04/2009,More Fun than my 911's-Part II,5,"After 12000 plus miles the car is flawless..it gets better than sticker gas mileage..onboard computer displays your MPG in realtime and average...great feature...not a single problem ..average 36.5-39.5 ..it will get over 40 MPG if you drive it  easy on the highway at 70...Sports car ride more firmly than a luxury car..It is incrediblely stable and safe at ""highway plus"" speeds...also has fantastic brakes..Tons of leg room..We plan to add a 2009 S Convertible so our 2008(yellow) will have a playmate...as soon as she decides on the color....If you're a car guy you'll love this car....If you not, you'll still love this car!"
mini,cooper,2008,KarenZ, 06/05/2009,This is a fun but wacky little car!,4,"Pros: handling fuel efficiency (my avg 30.4, I think) parking (mwah, ha ha!!!!!...that little space is mine all miiiiiine!) power/acceleration dash layout fit and finish reliability ipod-friendly ($12.00 male-male cord. Plugs right in...totally easy!)  Cons: Very jerky acceleration Somewhat jerky braking The seat belt thing gets caught in the space where the door jamb is.I've tweaked my back/shoulder muscles a few times. Hate that! Awful cupholders. If you can get a soda cup out without crushing it, you are amazing and you should become a surgeon. Trunk locks when doors are locked. Even if you've already ""popped"" it. Annoying! Wind wiper controls stink. And only two intermittent speeds."
mini,cooper,2008,marcia low, 08/10/2009,No more sidewalk model,5,I love my British racing green convertible. The sidewalk package has all the bells and whistles esp the gorgeous brown leather interior. Now they won't make it any more. I am disappointed I wanted a new one only because I think the rear window visibility would be much improved with the retractable roll bars.
mini,cooper,2008,MAM, 08/13/2009,"Too much maintenance, too much time",2,"It's a fun car to drive, great gas mileage, cute etc, but very expensive for repairs. In one year, I've spent $2500 out of pocket on a car I bought brand new from the dealer, in addition to the gas to get to the dealership (100 miles roundtrip in DC traffic) and taking time off work (they close at 7pm)."
mini,cooper,2008,No Fun , 08/14/2009,Cooper MINI Convertible,2,"I am very disappointed with the engine & automatic transmission design.  There is a very bad dead zone in the acceleration in 1st from a dead stop. The top squeals when coming up. The maintenance is free but when they don't fix anything it's worthless. The repair shop isn't familiar with the car and can't fix problems.  I have had to go back 4 or 5 times before something gets fixed. They have even lied, actually fixed something and said on the repair sheet that there was nothing was wrong. I would not recommend anyone buy this Car with an automatic. The rear view is cluttered and very dangerous to back up.  The automation in the controls is stupid, mostly unnecessary and very annoying"
mini,cooper,2008,kmbkat, 10/17/2009,disappointed,3,Bought my Mini new in 2/08 and the fuel pump went out at 17000 miles. Although it was covered under warranty I can only guess what troubles lie ahead. I also had to replace one of the run flat tires to the tune of $249. The car is fun to drive and I have adequate space since I no longer have young kids to transport. But once I experience a major mechanical failure I start looking for a new car. I plan to buy a new Honda or Toyota in 2/10.
mini,cooper,2008,NotSoGreat, 12/11/2009,Beware of water for Mini Convertible,2,"To those of you considering buying the Mini Convertible. There is a design issue where water pours into the Mini on the driver's side when you open the door or window when it is, or has been, raining. I thought mine had a problem, only to find out after three visits that it's just the design that is an issue and thus can't be fixed. It's been fun driving it, but the water issue is a deal killer for me so I will be selling my Mini."
mini,cooper,2008,RJ, 01/28/2018,Love my Mini!,5,"Best car I've ever owned! I've had it for 10 years now, and love it!  I've owned Chevy, Ford, Nissan, and Toyota in my 40 years of driving, and my Mini performs the best, gets the best mileage (over 40 mpg!), is the most fun to drive, and is SO good looking! The only problem with a small car is sometimes trucks on the highway don't see you, so you must drive very defensively.
"
mini,cooper,2008,Larry, 03/19/2018,Mini Sports Car,5,"Dealers are in the big cities, but there garages that work on them.  My Mini has required no maintenance other than oil changes and tire rotation.  I did put in a new battery last summer.  It didn't give me any trouble,  but it was getting old.  I love driving it!  No one can keep up with me on tight curves and ramps.  I haven't tried for 140+ top speed yet.  I've close enough that I know it will do it.  Six speed tranny is as good as any I've driven.
"
mini,cooper,2008,Raymond Piechocki, 09/14/2018,Rocket in a Shoe Box,4,"This a really great car that I have enjoyed for 10 years. I have driven the car on long road trips and it has performed well in a number of different areas  with great performance and reliability. Maintenance, other than routine, has been at a minimum until about 6 months ago. Then the computer went, costly repair. Remember, the MINI is a member of the BMW family, and that translates into EXPENSIVE.  Given its pedigree, I expected the quality to be much higher. There is a lot of plastic and rummer that is exceptionally poor in quality. Rubber windshield gasket deteriorated very early in its life but that deterioration did not effect performance (no leaks), it just did not look good.  This happened in a number of cases around and under the car with gaskets and seals. I attend to keep the car forever because the cost of repairs is more than I can get if I try to sell it. I love driving it, and it appears that I will do just that!!!
"
mini,cooper,2008,Reu, 12/20/2018,Why you should never buy these cars!,1,"Ok first off keep the model of the 2008 Mini Cooper S as named R56 and the type of engine as the N14. Major! Major! Major! Issues wrong with these dang engines. Just YouTube oil filter housing gasket leak and oil cooler gasket leak, turbo oil feed line replacement, valve cover gasket replacement and exhaust leaks on the 2008 R56. If you plan on buying this vehicle get prepared for an extra $2,000 dollars just in repairs if it is 10 years or older. Not to mention you have to clean out the air intake valves of all the carbon which is maintenance fee of $200.
"
mini,cooper,2008,Bismark, 08/29/2008,Total Recall,2,"The Mini S convertible is a cute and stylish car, with decent power and superior handling, but these are the only positives I can grant it. Ride on 17 inch runflats is appalling (and I have driven track-prep'd cars on the street for years, and ride motorcycles, so I am no 'princess and the pea'). Cannot adjust seats to my liking, knee rubs vs center console constantly. Ergonomics laughable (speedometer is a decoration as it's well out of the driver's vision, window toggles badly placed, climate controls non- intuitive), gearbox vague, rear- visibility non-existent/dangerous. Cute weekend toy car, but non-viable as modern commuter to anyone over the age of 25. Oh, and my mpg? Only 20 avg."
mini,cooper,2008,Turbo S, 07/25/2009,One year in my Cooper,4,"Had the car for little over a year now.  It is an absolute BLAST to drive, and will always put a smile on your face.  Fuel economy is phenomenal for a car this fast as well.  Lots of cool features, like the folding mirrors, that are more fun the show of than functional, but fun either way.  The pushbutton start is cool, but I wish it had the comfort access system.  The leatherette looks nice, but I don't like the way it feels.  All in all, for $25,550 and the included maintainance, its a lot of fun for the money."
mini,cooper,2008,Unhappymotorer, 08/18/2009,"Beware of ""Warranty""",3,"I bought my car brand new a year ago -- have loved it despite quirks with the windows (no fix for it yet...supposedly coming in late 2008). Drove it responsibly for 14,000 miles in the year to include a trip across country.  Now the clutch is ""burnt"" and its not covered under the warranty. They are blaming me, which is ridiculous. I would be wary of buying one again."
mini,cooper,2008,Alex, 03/21/2008,Flawed,3,"I took ownership of my brand new Mini on January 22, less than a month later the mini lost all its brakes (because the brake hydraulic line was not properly attached to the brake system) while I was driving 65 mph.  Scary as all hell, could have been injured bad, but was lucky that the road I was on was relatively traffic free.  Response from Northwest Mini was too bad for you and it was the same for MINI USA.  Looks like the safety inspections do not include checking the brake lines.  You'd think that would be fundamental.  The Mini is extremely fun to drive but hard to trust to keep you safe.  I really hope my experience is out of the ordinary, but folks should be aware before they buy.  "
mini,cooper,2008,rob_gendreau, 05/30/2008,Sports car disguised as econo-car,4,"The MINI has been described as a go-kart with functionality, and that's not far wrong. The car is a blast to drive, but works as a comfortable, affordable economic daily driver. The gas mileage is awesome: I get about 35 MPG in mixed freeway/surface driving. The standard Cooper has more than enough performance pizzazz to delight anyone who likes driving, and it's even a decent autocrosser for those who are more ambitious. A great way to have fun and not go broke in the era of $4 gas."
mini,cooper,2008,EC, 06/06/2008,Fun!,4,"The Mini Cooper S was the last in a long line of cars we looked over. From Honda, Mercedes, Infiniti, GM, Toyota, Smart, we looked over and drove various models for 6 months before deciding. The Mini Cooper S was hands down the most fun to drive. The acceleration, handling, and manual / automatic transmission features were the most notable. The Mini makes the simplest driving trips more interesting and exhiliarating with the feel of the road evident in every drive. My wife and I both enjoy driving the car and look forward to taking a vacation during the summer to several destinations in the US.  "
mini,cooper,2008,Laurie, 06/17/2008,Fun Car!,4,"I was looking for a smaller car with better gas mileage than my SUV. I considered the Prius but didn't like the design or the high price tag. The Mini has it all - economical, fun, great gas mileage, excellent and unique styling! The car is a blast to drive and much roomier than it looks from the outside. Add the roof rack for additional storage and you're good to go!"
mini,cooper,2008,Jerry, 06/29/2008,Unfair Advantage,5,"This car definitely presents an unfair advantage over all other cars. Having owned a used car dealership and driving dozens of different car over the years, the Mini Cooper takes them all by storm. Hands down, it is by far the best car. Excellent mileage, get- up-and-go, cornering, comfort, reliability, and just down right fun! Total strangers walk up to you and start a conversation about it. It stands out from the other faceless shadows in the parking lot. It truely is BMW's ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" and ""Driving Excitement"". (Sorry Pontiac, you lose)."
mini,cooper,2008,Michael Berliner, 07/05/2008,My Second MINI,5,"My last MINI was a 2003 hard top, and this new convertible is much better than my old car. It was love at first sight when I picked it up at the dealer. I've had it for a month and it is past the 1250 mile break-in point, and it is more limber and willing.  As far as I'm concerned, I'll be happy to drive this MINI for many years."
mini,cooper,2008,max from mini, 08/06/2008,Mini,5,Very peppy. Fun to drive. Excellent in the city or the highway. Does better gas mileage than is advertised. Can't mistake this car with anything else. Exterior design stands out from the crowd and you dont have to break the bank for it.  
mini,cooper,2008,ATMNLV, 08/16/2008,Fun but beware,4,Love the car very comfortable with more than enough power. Car has 2000 miles on it and my engine hood scoop is melting which is happening to a lot of cars. MINI won't reply or hasn't recalled this design defect
mini,cooper,2008,VICKIE , 08/24/2008,Awesome Mini,5,I first got my Mini Cooper in March of 2007. I love the way the Mini handles on the highway and the way she hugs the mountain roads. I wish there was a little more leg room in the back but I only have one child and we just bought her the 2008 Mini Cooper and she is loving her own Mini. We can take both Mini on a road trip and still walk away with money in our pocket from saving on fuel. We will always be a Mini Cooper family.. 
mini,cooper,2008,TPAMiniGuy, 09/02/2008,More fun than my 911,5,"Loved the original MINI but was too young to drive one. What a great car. So glad they brought the marque back. It is a superb car, performance, handling, comfort. Ordered my ""S"" kinda bare bones, sport suspension, limited slip, and better sound system. It has alot of high tech items in what seems like a low tech car. Great A/C even in the Florida heat. Surprising good."
mini,cooper,2008,Arzie, 10/12/2008,16 MPG,2,"I've got 3000 miles on my Mini S convertible and I found out the hard way the marketing in better than the product.  I'm getting only 16 mpg, horrible. The exterior styling is great, but the interior is lacking. The cup holders are useless in that they are too close to everything to  put other than the smallest cup in it.  And that is indicative of the entire vehicle, looks good but doesn't always work and it's usually too small to do the intended job.  I thought this would be a great fun car to drive but it seems I'm always driving to the gas station. I had a Toyota before and boy do I miss it."
mini,cooper,2008,chela348, 11/05/2008,Finally Got My MINI,4,"Recently graduated 7 years worth of pharmacy education and took advantge of getting my dream car. I can't recall the first time I ever saw it (tv, movies, drive past one) but I wanted one. I don't drive manual so I waited a month for my Oxygen Blue White Top MINI! I can't begin to explain how much fun I have driving it! I get so much attention from it and love waiving to my fellow MINI drivers! Gas is so ridiculous, I get over 40 MPG (especially if i switch to the fake manual). I enjoy my panoramic sunroof everyday. I'm a petite girl and feel like it was made for me in every way! Oh and I've only had the car for 2 months and it now has 3000 miles!"
mini,cooper,2008,jlee924, 12/30/2008,2008 Mini Cooper,5,"Got my Mini Cooper in May and I love the car. I had an SUV before, and I'm really liking not having to buy gas every week.  I'm getting around 35mpg with the 6 speed auto and while using the Triptonic trans. Handles surprisingly well in the snow too."

I have the 6 speed manual and  love it! I would pay all over again! One day I'll own an S-convertible and an S- clubman to finish my MINI family. I recommend these cars to anyone and everyone  come across! And I just got back from a cross country road trip, best and most comfortable drive I've ever had for long term road time."
mini,cooper,2008,Chip, 01/24/2009,A Real Smart Car,5,"After shopping hybrids, smart cars, and flex fuel, I opted on the Mini Cooper. It is great on short hops and long trips.  I have been getting incredible gas mileage on regular grade gasoline, 40 in town, 47 highway.  The car handles like a dream and one cannot omit the ""fun"" factor to drive one. I have 16"" run on flat tires, so the ride is a little bumpy at times, but for what it is, I consider it plenty comfortable. Nice leg room (I am 6'0"" and still must move the seat up some) for the driver and passenger.  Leg room for backseat passengers is questionable.  My wife liked mine so much, she bought an ""S"" model with automatic.  Recommend sport suspension and seats, with stereo upgrade.  "
mini,cooper,2008,Val, 04/01/2009,A Total Blast!,5,I was on my way to purchase the Acura RDX when the Mini Clubman caught my eye at the car show and I totally fell in love.

First it looks cool, so much fun to drive, can go up the hill soo much faster than other cars, still gets good gas mileage..I drive somewhat fast and like to accelerate and I have an automatic turbo charged..i push that sport button and this car will fly..still average 30miles per gallon, have the mini sound system...Fun, reliable, good mpg"
mini,cooper,2008,Family Guy, 04/20/2009,Short lived love affair,4,"I custom ordered my Cooper S manual last spring, and sold it after only 9 months of ownership. It was certainly fast (one speeding ticket), nimble and fun to drive, but even my 8 year old daughter complained that the rear seating was too small and that ""she didn't feel safe"". I regularly drive 2- 3 hour trips and found this car to be harsh riding, noisy and rattley. The small tires and wheels were simply no match for the rough roads around Ohio and Michigan. My full-sized buddies complained bitterly about no leg room when they rode with me, whether in the front or back seats.  Buy it for the city and only if you don't have kids."
mini,cooper,2008,Little Red Rocket, 04/25/2009,A MINI That Give You Alot!,5,"Have had my MINI for about 15 months. I'd have more miles on it but living in sunny AZ, I love riding my Bikes. This is one 'fun' car! Almost takes me back to when I owned a BMW 2002Tii. I had the JCW Performance Kit installed. Yes it really makes a difference! Not so much wth the JCW Brembo Brakes. Save yourself some money and stay with the OEM. Just about everyplace I park my MINI, people compliment it. My wife has an 06 Miata MX-5. Both cars have almost the same performance stats, but really feel different. The MX-5 is so smooth and natural. The MINI feels like every second it looks for a fight! What fun! Watch out for the options you order A $23K car cost over $40K easily Have fun!"
mini,cooper,2008,Ohioman, 05/02/2009,Short Lived Love Affair,3,"O.K., it's cute, fit well in my garage and was truly ""fun to drive"", but the novelty for us was over for us in a big hurry. It is a very small car, and while likely the best in its class, we found it cramped, noisey, rattley and poor riding, especially on road trips. The run-flat tires are bricks, the premium stereo was fair at best, it was nearly impossible to get comfortable (no,we aren't big people), and I really didn't care for the valve rattle at start-up on cold days.  I switched to a Camry SE V6 which is (yes) faster, more refined, has far nicer/more of ""everything"", and for about the same money. If you need to drive regularly, long distances or with others, don't buy a Cooper"
mini,cooper,2008,warren, 06/14/2009,MINI Cooper-The best in it's class!,5,"So far, my MINI is winner. As all other reviewers have commented on-- it's a blast to drive! Test drove the other subcompacts and MINI stood out from the pack.  Cornering and handling are outstanding with no body roll. Braking is very responsive and fuel economy is excellent averaging about 31mpg combined. Getting 44mpg+ on the Hwy with a light foot in 6th gear. Styling is one of a kind.  Base Cooper still nicely equipped without a lot of added options. Interior fit and finish is impressive. Ride is a bit firm, but still in a fun kind of way, although this can get tiring on long drives I must admit. Watch the road dips as this car sits low to the ground."
mini,cooper,2008,Sean Michael, 06/21/2009,"45,000 and still going!",4,OMFG THIS THING IS A BLAST!!! From the very get go I fell in love with a car my wife had suggested when I thought of getting a bug... I'm glad I went with the Mini. First of all I commute 184 Miles a day up and down from the mountains. Phx to Payson AZ of an elevation change of over 5000 ft. I needed something reliable and could handle the road and elements. This little car has sold me for LIFE! I love the Tech with the Sports handling. If you're thinking of buying your wasting precious time you could be driving. =)
mini,cooper,2008,Disappointed_in Mini, 08/11/2009,Another Clutch failure,3,This is my second mini.  The clutch went out in the first one after 2 1/ years  years and only 22000 miles.  The cause was determined to be a manufacture defect and was covered.  My 2008 Mini S has only 10727 miles and is a standard transmission too.  The clutch began slipping on this one. It is currently at the dealer and I am waiting to hear if the repairs are covered.  I do not ride the clutch and do not drive aggressively or even need to shift that often (not a lot of stop and go traffic).  I have read many posts on other sites about mini's and clutch problems.  Buyer be ware!!!
mini,cooper,2008,Timo, 02/24/2008,The Best trade-in Ever,5,We took ownership of this vehicle a mere ten days ago. We traded in 2002 Saturn. The Mini Coopers S is 100X different and better than the Saturn. My biggest worry was storage space. All of our groceries fit into the car. The drive is like being a rat in a chase. It moves flawlessly through traffic and poor weather.
mini,cooper,2008,TOMCAT, 03/04/2008,When I Press the Start Button!,5,"Ah! I have finally found the car I so dreamed of. Namely a car (to borrow the words of another automobile ad) when I 'press the Start Button' it presses my 'start button'! I traded in a 'perfect' 2007 Lexus RX 350 for the Mini. The Lexus was just too 'boring to drive. I wanted something with 'attitude'! With a doubt my MINI Cooper S is it! The only cars I can remember that I've owned that were this much fun and excitng to drive were my 1973 BMW 2002 Tii or my 1972 Capri (from Germany V- 6)!  Yes its ride is a bit 'taut', but if you're looking for a smooth ride, but a Lexus or a Buick. Everyplace I go, people stop to look and ask or compliment me about it. In short, I love my MINI! "

Im an engineer so I first look at the data behind the hype, I then have to touch/feel/analyze the product, and finally I take all the data gathered and throw it on the white- board and present it to my peers. The results are still wow!  The Mini convertible fits my lifestyle as my PC locks in the trunk, my CDs and IPod lock in the glove box, and my Mini has BLING just like my carbon fiber road bike. Don't buy this car if youre dont want to be noticed as Im amazed at how many strangers walk up and ask me Ive seen those and have wondered what they are like. How do you like it?"""

People who say it's under powered do not know how to drive a stick shift sports car properly. You must use the tach, rev the engine and you have to love to shift! Use it's power curve and it will never dsappopoint. I have a hard time keeping to the speed limit. My little car just wants to fly! It's very similar to my long-gone MG's, but better. It's faster, handles better, great mileage, little engine, big heart, I haven't had this much fun driving in years. No issues with reliablity. More room inside than my Pontiac and room for friends if needed. What more could you ask for? Love it!!"

But as time went on, my fiancee and I were growing weary of sharing here car. You know waiting to get picked up, waiting for me to get home so you can go out, etc. I made it as long as I could, and finally bought the car I wanted, the 2008 Mini Cooper!  I ended up getting one off the floor of the dealership, I thought I needed an S, but for me this one was the right one.  It doesn't seem as small as it looks when your in it, and that is key for me, coming from an SUV."

Mini Marketing kept me in the loop with what was going on with my car and supplied me with fun little mini accessories along the way.  I live in the city, and commute ~20 miles to work. On both fronts, this car is amazing... it puts a smile on my face when commuting (and not just because of the 39mpg), and makes me want to hug it when it inevitably fits in the most ridiculously small street parking spots.  The car oozes character."

They will NOT listen to the customer and will look for any reason than the one the customer is complaining about to blame the issue on.  My issue?  Carbon deposits in the motor.  Yes folks, this can happen to your ""fun loving"" MINI too - and probably will.  4 trips to MINI - 2 times with the engine light on and guess what?  Carbon deposits aka ""engine buildup"".  This issues starts to occur between 30- 40K.  You will notice skipping in 1st gear, decreased performance, oddities, etc... and the run around from MINI.  Good luck!

To prevent the carbon build up, I was told to use a gas additive every month and drive in a spirited manner every so often.

With my MINI S, I often find myself driving in a spirited manner. The horsepower is great for merging onto an interstate or passing slower cars on single-lane roads. It's also great for weaving in and out of rush-hour traffic.

The main drawback is the rough ride. I've hit potholes (and a ladder once) that have slammed my teeth together. However, the only damage done to the MINI was a broken headlight!"
mini,cooper,2009,Mel Collins, 12/28/2016,"""Frequent Flyer"" to the dealer service department!",2,"PLAIN AND SIMPLE-- JUST DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE !!!Bought it at Car Max in Whitemarsh, Md. 11/23/2014. Knowing it was a BMW product , and major repairs would be costly, we purchased the extended Warranty package for $4,600. And, we are so glad we did that! From 11/23/2014-10/16/2015 our 2009 Mini was back to Car Max for repairs 5 different times (variable inlet control valve; thermostat housing unit; $1,700 for the radio which controls half the instrumentation on the dashboard). Fortunately, all were covered by the extended Warranty, except the $150 deductible we had to pay out each time. Most recently, 12/23/16, check engine light on again. Stalling out problems & loss of heat from the heater. This time we took it to a Mini dealer in Towson, Md. They were open Xmas eve!! so we dropped it off & got a loaner vehicle. They just called us this morning, 12/28/16 with the diagnosis: Bad timing chain; excentric shaft; valve cover & cracked front strut mounts!! Total cost= $4,946.97. Extended Warranty is paying $4,676.97. We have owned this car for just 25 months; driven 21,000 miles; had the oil changed 4 times & it's been for major service repairs now 6 times !!!   So, if you just have to have a Mini, and you buy a used one, just bite the bullet & purchase the extended Warranty--NOT an Extended Service Contract--the Extended Warranty. Because you will certainly need it !!"
mini,cooper,2009,Luther McKeehan, 11/27/2015,A TRUE MONEY PIT! Buy Anything Else.....,1,"I have owned almost every type of car known to mankind and with one exception (67 Porsche 911 S) this is the worst car I've ever owned.  Maintenance cost are through the roof, parts and labor extremely expensive.  BMW sold the car with a long term KNOWN engineering defect (poor timing chain design) that has motors blowing up all over the world (ck the internet) at between 55k & 65k miles.  While maintained to absolute factory standards, mine blew up at less than 30 mph with 60k.  After fighting with the company for over 9 months (while I made car & insurance payments and had to acquire an additional vehicle) they only agreed to pay for the $11,000.00+ repairs after I recorded a series of conversations which proved I'd repeatedly been lied to and my attorney told them ""fix it today or we file tomorrow!""  The local dealership was super but BMW calls the shots.  Although they finally did agree that it was a design issue in the end they refused to reimburse me for the towing and miscellaneous out of pocket cost which had been promised to me in every single conversation.  BMW Corporation, in my humble opinion, is run by a bunch of crooks who sell cars with known defects and should be jailed.  I will NEVER purchase nor recommend any BMW product.  Also ask about the engine having to be completely torn down and shot sprayed with crushed walnut shells as part of regular maintenance cleaning because it is so poorly designed.   I lost thousands of dollars on this car.  They're cute and fun but don't walk....RUN AWAY FROM THIS LEMON!!!!!!

mini,cooper,2009,chungking, 01/23/2011,BUY OR CONSIDER BUT BEWARE,2,"I bought my Mini Cooper S 2009 brand new.
It was performing great for the first year but then as it got older although it was under mileage (12,700 miles) in 14 months of ownership, the engine experienced annoying pinging sound specially while on idling. Note* the engine is warm.
I took it to the dealership and was told it's normal.
 The pinging sound became louder and it sounded like a diesel engine.
I traded it in for a Mitsubishi Lancer Sportback AWD Turbo Lancer Ralliart."
mini,cooper,2009,Rob, 06/30/2009,"Despite the faults, my favorite car ever",4,"I've never had more fun in a car than in my MINI JCW.  It pulls hard from 2500-5000 RPMs, corners like no other, brakes instantly, and looks outstanding (mine's dark grey with a black roof). It's nice to be the envy of everyone on the road, especially others driving a Cooper or Cooper S. In fact, the sense of community with other MINI drivers is one of my favorite aspects of the car.  I was fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where I could afford the JCW, and the slight performance increase (and I mean slight - it's not much) and exclusivity factor made the extra money worth it.  HOWEVER, for anyone more sensible than I, the Cooper S is plenty fun and very much less expensive"

It has only 40,000 miles on it and has already been towed 3 times, had carbon buildup in the engine, a new clutch and flywheel (beware this costs over $2000), a new timing chain, tensioner, rails, and gears, and the list goes on!

Major complaints to MINI I have been learning about since review online.  My complaint to MINI fell flat on its face.  Thanks a lot MINI for all the consideration!  NOT!

mini,cooper,2009,Carly, 09/01/2016,Maybe New But Not Ever Used,2,"I bought a 2009 Mini Cooper w/ 92,000 miles on it-- major mistake. If you're set on a Mini like I was, only buy or lease a new one because when they are close to 100,000 miles they need lots of very expensive work.

Minis are super compact which means when a mechanic needs to get to say, the water pump, he has to take out other parts which results in much higher labor costs. Plus, the parts are expensive.

Bought it for $7500, put a couple thousand dollars into replacing the water pump, water pipe, radiator, thermostat, AC, brake rotors, and battery...and two years later could only get $1800 after the transmission went out. 

I had it inspected prior to purchase and pretty much everything checked out, other than the mechanic saying I'd need new brake rotors.

Don't make the same mistake. Minis are SO fun and great for parking and gas, but the cost of repairs on an older Mini gets to be traumatizing. They're just not meant to be driven past 95,000 miles.

My family of 4 fits just fine in my Mini.  And I'll tell you something else, that hatchback rear facilitates quite a bit of cargo that your standard 4-door compact could not handle.

I am writing this review for people who are considering buying this car for frequent long trips. The car is a blast but I'm not sure I would purchase again because of all the long trips I take. In 14 months I have driven this car almost 60k mi. To be honest, the interior is not very comfortable. After driving about 2 hours on the hwy I start to get fidgety. Being in the passenger seat is almost unbearable after 1hr. Great gas mileage, but not really any pickup on the highway. I know I sound like I'm complaining. I really love my Mini but if you plan on driving as much as I do, you might want to reconsider."

I built and ordered it online, tailor-made for me, after 6 wks, the car was at the dealer as I designed. Cool!  Overall, very happy; a great build quality (much better than I expected from a British make, but I guess German engineering is at work nowadays).  Will buy it again   "
mini,cooper,2009,Marian, 06/14/2010,Buyer Beware,3,"I purchased my 2009 Cooper S brand new (7 miles on it) in January 2009 from Brian Harris in Baton Rouge.  It has needed various major repairs on SIX occasions in a 15 months of ownership. It has also needed an additional two tows 90 miles away (from New Orleans) to have the run flats changed.  The repairs have involved mechanical and electronic defects. Perhaps this model is defective, but the car is utterly unreliable. And if you don't live near a dealership, forget about this car. It is cute and fun, but for the cost in time and money of dragging it in to a dealer time and again (and they never seem to know how to fix this model definitively), please save yourself the aggravation."

I would absolutely knowing what I know now never recommend this car to anyone.
If an engine light comes on the only acceptable answer is to stop and be stranded.
never ever get this car for young people or your wife.
Until recent issues we loved it, but now after terrible experiences with dealer not ours but on road and mini themselves I would never buy.

mini,cooper,2009,James K, 01/18/2018,Blast to drive but a burden to own,2,"The mini is such a blast to drive. It accelerates very well and hugs the road better than any other car I've driven. Plus the exhaust from the factory sounds pretty good. I loved the thing very much. Unfortunately those are it's only strong suits. I don't drive it too hard  and if I'm lucky I'll get 28 mpg highway. Combined it gets 25 which is very  disappointing from a small 1.6L engine. For reference I had a 2004 Impala get  better highway mileage and get 25 combined with a 3.8L v6. However very poor reliability is the downfall. In the short time I've owned it I've had coils go out, a water pump failed, and now have a bad lifter. Not only is it unreliable but parts are hard to find and very expensive. If you want a mini Cooper I strongly advise getting a 2011 model or later. Those are far more reliable than the 2010 model and earlier.

I have a Porsche Carrera 4 in my garage, and I find myself picking-up the keys to my mini more often than not.  It drives like a dream: It hugs the road like the best, it is roomier than the expensive german brother, and it gives me 35 miles per gallon on the freeway. People complain about a small trunk space: They should buy an SUV.  I play golf often and my clubs fit in the back with the rear sits down. If you want fun, reliable transportation, and great gas mileage: Buy a Mini-cooper S.  If you don't like it, no problem you'll be able to seel it for almost as much as you paid."

I've owned lots of cars through the years but I've never owned one that could bring such a big smile to my face! The Cooper S has all the features one could ask for in a street legal slalom car! It handles extremely well, is balanced in turns, accelerates when called upon, and is willing to squeeze through tight spots where no ordinary vehicle will venture! Combined mileage has been 31 MPG and that's good with me. I just wish the engine didn't just sip high octane! I'm 6'-2"" and fit very comfortably in either front seat (although I prefer the driver's side). The controls are not intuitive but they can be learned.

But before I drove it off the lot I was told it takes only premium gas-- not the good mileage I thought. Then all the dashboard lights started coming on, one at a time. The low tire light; I can't even tell which tire, but the only way to reset is to take it to Mini Hawaii to have them use the special hi-tech gizmo on it for $135! Then the engine light (which I think is related to a 1st-time gas fillup gas cap mistake) but I can't get that reset without the same $135 diagnostic gizmo. It's still cute, and I still love it but it promises to become very expensive in time and money. I have regret."

Every single time I take this car in it will cost anywhere from $500 to close to $3k per visit.  Items fixed/issues:  timing chain, thermostat, backfires, recall: high pressure fuel pump, engine blasted with walnut shells, new valve cover.  This is all that comes to mind at the moment but there is much more.  By the way...the car is at 108k...the timing chain is knocking horribly again...getting towed again today as I cannot drive it in the condition it is in.  The 1st timing chain above was redone December 2017.  I have almost spent as much as I paid for this vehicle in repairs.  Unfortunately this is the last straw...it will be fixed and sold.

I loved driving it, it made driving fun again because I hate to drive at all.  Then I became a mom and decided that I didnt want to buy a new car yet because I didnt want another car payment ( I dont like to drown in car debt).  It was difficult to get my daughter in and out with the car seat but once she was old enough to climb in and was forward facing, it was fine.  Overall very minimal cost as far as repairs, minor maintenance.  The only thing that went wrong was my radiator got a crack because I drove it too rough in the snow and jumped a curb.  I was going to keep it until it died but 2 weeks ago, it drowned.  My car got stuck in a flood and was totaled due to hurricaine Matthew.  Best part is, I got double the amount back for the car from insurance! It was paid off and still held a great value!  Needless to say, Im buying another MINI! But Im getting a clubman ( better for kids).

mini,cooper,2009,H&H, 08/02/2009,The MINI is so fun to drive,5,"This car is a birthday gift for my wife. She loves it very much. The car is very reliable, nothing wrong so far. The fuel efficiency is excellent. This car is very fun to drive, you will enjoy the driving. The MINI drivers are friendly, they smile to each other on the road. The car is small, but it runs very fast, you can easily reach 70mph on highway."
mini,cooper,2009,hellfire, 08/13/2009,replacement for my 911,5,"No it's not a 911, but it is surprisingly more fun. The quirky character starts with the handling and interior, and goes all the way to the company propaganda (love the 'always open' mantra and the crazy ads that go with it). I can pull more g's in the corners than i could with my 911 or boxster even on stock suspension & tires (love the incredulous look as i pass them on the curvy on-ramps).  incredibly easy to manage the manual transmission - heel-toe downshifts are easy, rev-matching is much easier than the supercharged minis.  averaging 29MPG with spirited driving+some stopngo."
mini,cooper,2009,CityDriver, 09/09/2009,The most fun car I've ever driven,4,"I wanted a combination of excellent performance with great gas mileage for under $25,000.  This car is by for the MOST FUN car I've ever driven, and I have had my share of fun cars.  The power and handling are very comparable to a BMW. The interior space is deceivingly spacious and although the rear seats are small, the back seats do not deserve the ""overly cramped"" reputation that they have earned, but you're not buying the car for the back seats.  The turbo is more than adequate considering the car gets 34 mpg on the highway.  There are a few negative aspects- the controls are not easy to use (radio, heating/cooling system) and the speedometer is in the center of the dash which is awkward."
mini,cooper,2009,milindsport, 09/10/2009,Hot Hatch,4,"Where do I start? This car so far has been such a pleasure to own and drive...and this is coming from a previous sport sedan owner. The ""WOW"" factor is definitely there...with impressive engine performance, great fuel econ and excellent driving dynamics. Apart from the performance factor, the design though polarizing to some is undeniably unique and the brand itself has a loyal and dedicated following with a large number of auto enthusiasts in the group. Finally the option to be able to customize this car to your exact specifications can be expensive yet a lot of fun. I have the ""S"" version which is a must for the performance oriented drive. Try the MINI....you will never stop smiling."

mini,cooper,2009,Ethan Lyon, 02/05/2019,Great First Car,4,"First off I would like to say that i crashed the car and ended up on my side. Going way to fast on snow/ice. My friend was in the car and were being young drivers. I was taking a 90 degree corner at about 25 on ice and snow and went off the road. I pulled the ebrake to swerve from a telephone pole and hit a bolder. It sent us up and back down on its side. The airbags did not deploy, but there was a recall that i never got around to. Both my friend and I got out with a few scratches. This car protected me and my frend. I will give it respect where its due.
"
mini,cooper,2009,RobInPhilly, 12/07/2019,Has made my daily commute a blast,5,"Bought this Cooper S as a second car, mainly to commute a 38 mile round trip daily. I do occasionally put my 6 & 8 yr old in the back, but it’s not an ideal or practical family car. 
The gas mileage is good and I average around 26mpg for my short trips and in the first 9 months of ownership (6000 miles) it’s been totally faultless. It’s at 42000 miles now, and 10 yrs old, so wouldn’t expect any major issues yet.
Driving this car is the best fun I’ve had behind the wheel and I’ve driven a lot of cars from Bentleys to old beaters. It’s like taking a puppy for a walk on a leash,  especially in sport mode. The handling is outstanding and the power is instant. This car is quick, but also very civilized when driven more moderately. Mine’s an auto transmission, but I switch to manual with the steering wheel paddle shifters and the transmission is a dream. The suspension and ride are a little stiff, but I’m still on run flat tires so will switch these out. Potholes or rough roads are best avoided!
For a small car the front is surprisingly spacious. I’m 6ft and can fully stretch out my legs when driving and the seats are very supportive.
Trunk space is minimal, but like I said I use this as a second car. Although I have squeezed in a full cart of groceries.
The built quality as as good as you’d expect from a BMW car, and I have no squeaks or rattles. The only noise I hear is from the growl of the exhaust pipes, which is like music. I mostly drive without the radio just to hear the car sing.
Probably not the best in snow, but is absolutely the most fun I’ve had driving.
Updated at 15 months and 46k miles: still loving this car, but a few words of warning. Mine has the factory sunroof, and it’s worth checking the drainage channels in the front corners of the roof frequently (you can find plenty of videos on YouTube). I didn’t realize mine were blocked with years of dirt and debris. We had a heavy rainstorm and when I opened the car door the following day I found 1/2” of water in the driver side footwell. I managed to dry it out thoroughly, but had multiple warning lights and my flashers were way too fast. The water had run through the headliner And straight through the footwell module, which is the main electrical unit. That’s a $1k+ rookie mistake and I’ll be checking tge drainage channels regularly now.
I also had a small oil leak, which turned out to be multiple leaks from various pipes and gaskets. It’s worth keeping on top of any oil leaks as the engine will always burn a little oil anyway and it’s not a motor you’d want to neglect oil maintenance on.
Not big issues for me, but worth pointing out.

mini,cooper,2009,Barb, 01/17/2009,Top Tier Gasolines,4,"I recommend that before you purchase a Mini you have access to top tier premium gas stations, such as Chevron and QT. If you live out in the countryside, as I do, be aware that using other than above mentioned gas will destroy your fuel pump system. Premium quality gasoline does not mean top tier...there's a mixture in other stations that may destroy your engine. Neither the Mini Cooper website  nor the Consumer's Report website made any mention  at all about this extremely important concern.  I was able to find a station within a 30 mile round trip from my home.  Again, think this out very well before you consider purchasing a Cooper!"
mini,cooper,2009,Andy J, 04/21/2009,Expensive but Worth It,4,"A home run; why can't US car companies build something like the MINI? We paid right at $30K for the car and feel like we got a bargain.  The new MINI retains some British charm but really should be regarded as the smallest member of the BMW lineup -- it looks and feels incredibly solid for a small convertible. My wife says she feels like she's behind the wheel of a baby tank.  Our ""S"" cabrio w A/T is returning 31 MPG in mixed city/hwy driving to date. What a combination of power and fuel economy -- way to go BMW/Peugeot!  Way, way bigger inside than it looks from the outside -- I'm 6'2"" 200 lbs and very comfortable in drivers seat. Trunk is tiny, but useful w/back seats folded down."

The way it handled the looks you get when you roll up in a crowd. Great gas miliage. I got her the automatic in pepper White and she loves it! As a father I feel at ease when she is in her mini. A great car! Parents if you are looking to hook up the kid with a safe and cool looking ride just go test drive the mini and you will get one too trust me. My daughter still asks me is this mini really mine?

If you don't go crazy with options MINI is reasonably priced. Engine is hugely satisfying at any range while still averaging 28 mpg combined cycle and has great resale value. The options list is as huge as a 911s which costs 4 times as much. There are tons of options for after-market parts. I love the free maintanance program."
mini,cooper,2009,Mflem300, 02/13/2009,Lots O'Fun,4,Ordered from the website and it was waiting for me when I returned from Iraq.

I was shocked and sold when I sat in one and it was extremely comfortable and roomy. Get a convertible or a sunroof because they operate great. It gets great gas mileage and all maintenance and the entire car (Including paint and body) is guaranteed for five years. I don't have to change the oil or nothing. All i have to do is put gas in it and that isn't very often. What a wonderful car!

I am 6' 2"" tall and I have more headroom in my Mini than many vehicles I have driven.  The fuel economy is great! I average 35 - 40 MPG around town.  My Mini only has three options (speed control, bonnet stripes and checkerboard mirrors) and it was well worth the $20,000 price tag."

Took it on a trip from Detroit Michigan to Naples Flordia 3 months after taking delivery. Averaged 35-MPG for the trip and was comfortable for the 21 hour trip. Turned heads the entire trip and was just a blast to drive. This is my first MINI as well as my first small car and plan to keep it for a long time. Used to lease large SUV's or trucks in the past, but no more. I love my MINI!"
mini,cooper,2009,Larry, 05/17/2009,Minnesota Mini,4,"Bought as daily driver.

It's up to the dealer at this point to convince me that this can be resolved. I hear they get high marks for service that's customer oriented, so far they have been, but the electrical issue is still there after stranding me the first time.

mini,cooper,2009,kLINGON1, 06/26/2009,Not What You Think,4,"I have about 3000 miles on this car with, thus far, no defects.  I bought the car because fo the retro looks, handling, fuel economy, and relatively low price given the abundance of features.  I was correct in all these suppositions but greatly underestimated how disagreeable the ride is.  Even after abandoning the pathetic runflats for top rated normal performance tires, the ride is jiggly under all conditions but the smoothest roads.  Now those of you not bothered by this and there must be many, fine.  However, this is by NO MEANS a discounted BMW.  BMWs work magic somehow in the first 10 cm of suspension travel, soaking up road inperfectis while keeping phenomenal traction. This is no BMW"

Love the heated seats and mirrors during the cold northern Ohio winter, and have been loving the dual sunroof this Spring/ Summer. I must say, I was a little concerned about the upcoming Winter, but the Mini was a dream to drive in the snow as well.

When I first bought it I loved the way it looks and the tightness of feel it gives when you drive. I now have about 16,000 miles on it, and had no single problem with a car so far. One thing I am very dissatisfied is this car tends to jerk occasionally when you press the gas gently. Seriously. Also even though I've heard model S has so much power and accelerates fast, I absolutely disagree. It really does not accelerate that fast from stop to 60 or accelerating while going. On the freeway, I always have hard time trying to cut other cars off without using sports mode. Even with sports mode, this car just does not accelerate that fast."

mini,cooper,2010,dynamos, 02/06/2012,Not Reliable,3,"We loved our Mini--until about 15,000 miles, when it began to run a little rough.
By 18,000 miles, the check engine light came on.
We took it to the local Mini dealer for service.
Turns out there were multiple error messages, due to excessive carbon build-up in the engine.
The problem was caused by the direct injection system.
They cleaned the engine by removing the intake manifold and blowing out the engine with crushed walnut shells.
Also, the timing belt tensioner was loose and leaking oil.
They tightened it and replaced the gasket.
The service writer stated that the repairs would have cost over $600 if the car was not on warranty."
mini,cooper,2010,captain9766, 06/19/2015,BUYER BEWARE,2,"I purchased the Mini Cooper S used and it had 32000 kilometers on it. Initially all was well, great mileage, fun to drive, moves well but then stuff went from bad to worse. The check engine light came on. I took a day off work, traveled 150 klms and took it to a Mini dealer. They did their exploratory diagnosis and informed me that it needed spark plugs- even though the manual says plugs are good for 100,000. After $580.00 the plugs were changed and the light stayed off for 50 klms. Must need injectors was the next diagnosis for $1200.00. the light stayed off for 1 week even though the mini ran like crap in that week. Traded the mini off at a dealer as I could not sell privately. They say the engine gets a carbon build up which I could maybe understand if I was only running it back and forth to the mailbox but, I was driving it 50k on highways 2 times a day and only using premium fuel.  Very disappointed.  I also own a BMW and This is supposed made by them...must be at their training school side. Not the quality at all.

mini,cooper,2010,AJ, 11/18/2016,My wife's rotten apple,2,"Don't go look or ride in this car - you will probably fall in love with it, like we did (if you like sporty little cars)!  But don't do it, unless you have money to burn.  You will be taking this car to the BWM dealer for any maintenance or repairs - need I say more?  And, there are many poor engine parts and defects that you will have to do your homework on to know about and monitor:  value tensioner and guides, thermostat and housing, oil CONSUMPTION.  True, we bought the car used with only 28,500 miles and it was in good condition.  We have babied this car; but now with only 70,100 miles the thermostat locks up, the engine overheats, and the head gasket blew ($2900 min repair).  Before this event it used at least a quart of oil between oil changes, and a good bit more if you took an interstate trip;  and the timing chain noise had been increasing (not yet to the 'death rattle' level).  We babied this car, drove it mildly, and changed the oil early ($90 at dealer).  I'm looking at selling the car for parts (we paid $17,000 used when we bought it) for probably no more than $3000 with bad engine, or a complete engine rebuilt (head gasket, timing chain, and god know what else by a local euro car shop) for about $4500 for a car that now is selling for about $8000 used, in good condition!

These cars, if you buy into the cult of mini that has the money to love every design flaw and gleefully pay for them have known things that always go wrong the thermostat housing, $500, new turbocharger, $1600, they flood and won't start after sitting for a week, $280. Run flat tires $210 each and now there is an airbag error light and the air conditioning quit.  I have spent thousands on this pile of junk and now at 75k miles the engine is getting rough with misfires.  This is the carbon build up due to direct port fuel injection.  This car is an over engineered unreliable nightmare. BMW doesn't give a crap that they pump out junk in a cuddly cutesy package.  They want your money.  At the dealer $21 for a spark plug .

We went to MINI of Concord who we have delat with in the past, always finding them very professional during and most important after the purchase.  After a long test drive my wife and I decided to purchase the MINI Hardtop.   After taking the car home we started to see the advantages of the vehicle and I  have to admit when you drive it, it does make you smile.   I handles like a go cart but not as rough a ride with the 15"" wheels. Performance is really nice even with the Auto Select Shift Transmission that we got as an option."
mini,cooper,2010,John Brown, 01/27/2016,Looked nice but what a waste of money.,1,"I owned a 2010 JCW for 7 months. The shortest I ever had a vehicle. I bought it used with under 10K miles. Initally I wanted a fuel efficient small fun car. Albeit small this car really had nothing else going for it. The fun factor wore off already on the second month of ownership when the clutch needed replacement. Since I bought the vehicle from a mini dealer they helped a bit with the cost. I paid 1200 vs the 4000 they initially wanted to charge. After some research I realized it takes 20 hrs of labor to do the job. Everything in this car is so compact that you nearly have to take out the engine for major repairs. I replaced the battery myself and ended up removing  windshield trim pieces to access the battery compartmemt. Sorry not very well engineered. The service departmemt told me that the clut h on Minis can easily burn out every 10K to 20K miles. Another weird Mini fault is that for some reason the engines burn oil. Mini service actually recommends that you check the oil monthly or every 1K miles and refill. In terms of ride quality, this car is terrible. I actually started to develop bak pain from the poor seats and stiff suspension combo. The entire quality is cheap for a car in this price range. Performance was fun at first, but I soon realized that there are plenty of other options out there. This car handles like a go cart so you get the illusion of speed. Fun on twisty roads but when you feel every little bump in your lower bak the fun wears out quick. I chose to purchase this car because Mini always intrigued me, now I learned my lesson and will never go back. After only 7 months of ownership I went back to a normal car not needing so much tlc and $$$. If you are the kiND of person that purchases a car for dependability, resale value, efficiency, comfort, etc this is not the car for you.

The safety ratings were good, gas mileage excellent, and the performance is fun without being overwhelming for a new driver.  Outward visibility is exceptional!  I was concerned about reliability ratings, however, as a longtime BMW owner, I’ve come to learn that most people will only give reviews on negatives and not highlight the positives.  We’ve had no issue with this car, but if we do, I have a greY service department at our local BMW/Mini dealership.

mini,cooper,2010,es, 10/21/2010,Great Alternative,5,"This car is perfect for my daily 20 mile, one way commute. Fits into 50% more parking spaces - such a pleasure in NYC. Performs great although gear-shifting in auto lags a bit. Switching to manual takes care of that. Love the look and roomy interior (cant speak for backseat.) Gas mileage a little less than estimated (27) but still very good (24-25). Sport mode is a little jumpy for city driving (for me) but great for highway. Overall very very pleased with purchase."

mini,cooper,2010,faye, 02/11/2016,Worst car experience,2,"I Bought this car after having driven a 1998 Ranger for a year and a half. It was supposed to be my rliable vehicle. I bought it used and for the first month it was great. Pros: it accelerates well, can park anywhere,and has great fuel economy. Cons: closest dealership is 4 hours (300+ miles) away & getting them to do anything is like pulling teeth, repairs are a nightmare as they are way over what i have ever paid in repairs on any other vehicle, constant breaking down. I can honestly say ihave paid more on this car to fix it then i have actually gotten paid off on it and i have had it almost two years and only driven it less then half of that as repairs usually take a month or more to get done.

2 soft tops ($5000) - eg broken defoger means you have to buy a new top
Timing chain recall $4800
Multiple scheduled break jobs ($4000)
Shorted computer ($3800)
I can keep listing, but you get the idea. Car was sold with 8 months left on extended warranty.  When not in the shop, this was a super fun car

mini,cooper,2010,Allyson, 09/26/2018,"It may be cute and fun, but NOT worth the headache",1,"I bought this vehicle because I wanted a RELIABLE vehicle and the reviews seemed promising. The gas mileage was also a HUGE selling point for me. Unless you live near and Actual MINI COOPER dealership/service repair shop and have $$ to spend on replacing incorrectly made parts. So far my timing chain, high pressure fuel pump, oil seal, AND now my Thermostat housing have all been recalled. Being covered under warranty SEEMS like an acceptable compromise, but unfortunately mini demands only MINI service can repair the vehicle under warranty. So when you like 155 miles from a Mini dealership having it towed to be repaired is going to run you another $500. These vehicles were not build correctly resulting in MANY MANY recalls warranty fixes. DON'T PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THIS.

Very pleased with this Mini S."
mini,cooper,2010,Mini lover, 05/22/2018,Mini car maxi love,5,"I bought this car new and loved every day of driving it. Love, love, love, and super fun. As the car aged I had to stay on top of the oil consumption which eventually got tiresome. The ride was rough for a passenger and the cabin was noisey to make and receive calls.  The convertible cover creates a big blind spot, but with such a small body it never felt like a safety issue.  After driving over 120k miles I just traded it in for a small SUV only because my auto needs have changed. The mini convertible is a fun, darling car.

I've owned a 1966 Porsche 911, a 1973 Porsche 911s and a 1985 Porsche 930, but I can honestly say my little Mini although it ""ain't a Porsche"", is a blast. I've got 50k on it and my MPG which I never have reset is 37.5 and my average MPH is 58.9 over those 50,000 miles. Top speed, 149......I couldn't get it to 150. Oh well, 149 MPH is pretty fast and it'll get there pretty quick. I truly love my Mini! Had a few minor issues, the weather strip around the windshield disintegrated which I believe was caused by the protective coating spray used on the windshield glass. The speakers on the doors are located just right so your foot hits it when you exit the car, the cover is cracked as  a result. The pano roof gave me some problems on hot days, it wouldn't open. Other than those few issues its been great!

We purchased the 2010 JCW a couple weeks ago and WOW  what an upgrade.  From the Harmon Kardon audio, to more comfortable interior, this car has exceeded my wife's expectations as well as my own.  The only downside is the recommendation not to exceed 4000 RPM during the first 1000 miles-this car is begging to be motored...we cannot wait to feel the redline performance of this car.  As for Breaking, you tap the pedal and the brakes grab, and grab hard-the seat belts are more for controlled breaking than inmpact!  You will appreciate the stopping power-you will love the acceleration and burble of the engine and exhaust!"

I had liked the VW GTI, But hubby and daughter were sold on this..but now that I have driven it - I love it too!  the gas mileage is great we are getting 33/36 mpg!  and it is fun!  I find that I have a bit more of a defensive driver as people tend to run you over. But our 16 yr loves it and I see that she is a better driver too.  We had a Mustang GT, but this far better and we are glad we bought it!  We keep it in sport mode for city driving (the turbo lag is the only thing I don't like) but Sport mode takes that away.  Get the Mini Cooper S...and the good stereo."

The Mini Cooper S is so fun to drive you may, as I did, have to adjust to having a car that handles so well, an engine that is just so eager to jump at being driven hard, and still manage to get around 30 mpg in the process."

Fun to drive, great performance, abysmal reliability. Have had it back to the dealer so many times, I’ve lost count. All engine related problems. Oil leaks, recalls, starting problems, check engine light, and on, and on. Engine was made in France by Peugeot. HUGE mistake. It’s been a money pit since the warranty expired. Rest of the car is great! Transmission (6 speed automatic) is Japanese (thank God!) and has performed flawlessly for over 100K miles.

Before we signed the purchased contract, we found the iphone/USB port does not work. The dealer insured us that was just a very minor and common issue in some 2010 mini and could be fixed easily by updating software upgrade or just replacing a small united called ULH box (where all the wires for the usb/ipod connect).  He said if we can wait for a few hours they can fix it. We were so stupid and believed his words, and took the car since we run out of the time stay over there.  Now it turns out a very serious problem, after I send the car back for them to fix. They cannot fix the USB port in a few hours but request a few days."

The dealer wanted a small fortune to do the repairs so I shopped around.  I purchased a complete clutch assembly including the flywheel for a 1,500.00 and paid the labor. The whole job set me back $2,300 us then on to the brakes. I purchased drilled and slotted front rotors, new rear rotors, front and rear premium pads with hardware from Rock auto for $151.00 us and had them installed for $120.00 us. so for about $2,600.00 us I had a screaming mini that was quick and stopped fast.

From what I've seen to far, it's incredibly fuel-efficient and quite fast. The back seat definitely is a con but I really wanted the 2 doors because it doesn't affect me very much and looks very clean. I don't carry much stuff or many people. Its not that expensive to insure as people think and I think the interior is beautiful even though there are some control flaws like the controls for the heat and windows are behind the cup holders which is strange and inaccessible when being used. I enjoy the little things like the mini coloured lights and the sun guard for the sunroof. there are definitely design flaws but I've already put in 50 hours while having it for 3 days and I'm incredibly happy. It had 88000KM on it and then they mechanics messed up the engine by not hooking up the coolant hose correctly and had to replace it so the engine is now new for me.

mini,cooper,2011,David Ginsburg, 07/25/2015,MINI is a big LEMON,2,"You could buy a MINI...or you could throw a pile of cash into a burning dumpster and get the same value. I have a 2011 MINI S, with 63k miles. Car is CONSTANTLY in need of repair. To date, I've replaced the ignition coils and spark plugs three times apiece--THREE TIMES!-- plus hoses, a water pump, drive wheel, fly wheel, water pump pulley, and the AC compressor. Now, the radio is fried and the replacement is $1,000.00 installed. 

It's hugely expensive and frustrating, and I would NEVER buy another MINI. I've spoke with the customer relations team several times, and although they are very nice and do their best to placate customers, that's all they do--placate you. There is never an actual solution provided. I'm hoping a class-action suit is filed against MINI soon, because I believe they are defrauding consumers with poorly-built cars and hiding the true costs of ownership. This is the worst ownership experience I've had in 25+ years of driving.

mini,cooper,2011,Indy Musician, 04/03/2016,Wish I had read up more on the common problems....,3,"I bought my 2011 manual base Cooper with 35,000 miles on it....now, at 54,000 miles, it has had a failure of two coils. This turns out to be VERY common with Minis when you go to the various forums.  The car will sputter on acceleration, take up to 10 seconds to turn over in the morning, etc. and the problem only worsens unless tended to.  Cost at an independent mechanic to fix? $650.

Another common problem is dirty injectors at this point.

Oh, and it needs a full synthetic oil....so, when you were hoping to get the $19.99 oil change at Car-X, it quickly triples that cost. :/

And the brakes are about gone now, too, despite mostly highway driving.

And the worst part? Don't get a flat tire. There is NO SPARE. NONE. 


The only good part of this car is the gas mileage, but even then, it's not as good as other manuals out there. I get about 33 mpg with, as I said, mostly highway driving.

They are like purchasing an appliance.
We had the Mini for 5 months when the timing chain broke at a red light, destroying the engine.

This left me with a $6000 engine replacement and God knows what after that.
Know this; if you are not rich, buy Japanese every-time.
Here's an update: the engine that replaced the one that had the timing chains fail, HAD ITS TIMING CHAIN FAIL!  TWO ENGINES, SAME CAR LESS THAN 3 YEARS.  BMW KNOWS IT SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL AND REFUSES.  THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD.  WHEN THE TIMING CHAIN SNAPS, THE MINI IS INOPERABLE.

I took a 700 mile trip north and avg 46 mpg on a flat expressway with keeping the speed of 65mph. If you go above that MPG will not be as great. 70 mph not bad and still received 42mpg. Keep your foot out of it and shift easy 32-35mpg in city shouldn't be a problem. I installed a K&N Typhoon kit and sounds great and improved MPG. I looked at many other cars in the same type of class. This one gave me the most personal room. It's bigger than you think on the inside. I can even fit my kids booster seats in.

I purchased the Mini with under 50,000 miles on her.  I started having problems around 60,000 miles.  I took her to a local BMW repair shop due to a lack of acceleration.  I was told that she needed an walnut blasting due to carbon build up on the engine intake.  They also replaced plugs and wires....$700.00.  Later, I had a brake (dash) light come on.  I took her back to the repair shop.  I was told she need brake pads, new sensors and rotors.....$900.00.  I did not purchase an extended warrant so this was an out of pocket expense. I was told by the mechanic that everything should be good for awhile. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in Mini...... Well, I now have almost 70,000 miles on her, with no recent problems.  I still must say.....I still love my Mini JAZZ.  She is my midlife crisis...LOL......Deb

The only one bought new was the 2015 R60 the others we shopped and did our due diligence when purchasing.  Some of the negative buyers should have researched their problems better.  Maybe I have an advantage since I grew up fixing my cars and my dad was an auto parts dealer.

mini,cooper,2011,clutchplate, 05/24/2011,"""S"" engine is now a star",5,"It's hard to believe the Mini Cooper S is only rated at 181 horsepower, it feels like more. After driving the standard Cooper hardtop the difference was night and day... if you can't afford the S, don't drive one. 

I also have a Lotus Elise & have been driving both up the same canyon road to observe the differences. The Lotus corners quicker/flatter, but the Cooper launches you out of a corner with more low end (turbo) thrust. Its power is in the midrange and it flings you forward from around 3,000 RPM. What a blast. It leans a bit while cornering but stays neutral when you hit the gas so you don't need to enter a turn super fast to maintain speed. Great fun, great car. "

Can't fix anything unless you have a pix or video to show the problem. Was missing parts from the factory also. Problems still exist. BMW USA offered to replace the car because of all the problems, then changes their mind the next day when we were going to take their offer. Be very careful if you decide to purchase this car from Mini(BMW USA), they do not stand behind their product. Guess that is why there is the LEMON LAW. May have to go to court to get relief.

another '11 Cooper ""S"" -- she previously owned an '05 ""S"" and thought AWD was the way to go.


She knew the minute we drove off the lot (w/Countryman) that she would be back for another hardtop--just no comparison.

The '11 hardtop is great -- Mini has worked hard to refine the hardtop over the years and it shows.
The quality of the car is outstanding whether you're talking about engine performance, handling, interior quietness...it's all better!"
mini,cooper,2011,Bob Bechtel, 11/08/2018,Sportbox,4,"This model was known to be only marginally reliable but has been exceeded my expectations. Repairs have been limited to a few recall issues. Around town mileage has been steady at 30.1 which, I believe, is better than the EPA estimate. My only complaint has been the gearbox design. Lack of a reverse lockout means that quick 3/2 downshifts require extreme care.

mini,cooper,2011,Bruce, 08/31/2017,Small package - Great reward,5,"Having owned several lower-end sports cars in my life (Fiat 124 and X-19, a 1972 Mini, and a Matra-Simca Bagherra), I can happily say that this car has been more fun to drive than anything before. I am a bit of a stickler for traffic laws, but there's a large playground between zero and whatever. Even on highways with higher speed limits, the turbo-charged engine has sufficient zip to give the driver an adrenaline rush and cause a passenger to grab for the panic handle. Having said all of that, the potential cost to replace the  high pressure fuel pump (MINI has extended the warranty for this to 100,000 miles.) or the turbo charger gives me chills, but not the good kind. When it came time to replace the tires, I got rid of the run-flats and added a spare to the already small trunk. Big increase in handling and ride comfort, with great savings to the pocketbook. Overall rating for me is AWESOME!

mini,cooper,2012,Kevin, 03/09/2016,"2012 Base Mini, Manual Trans, Lemon",3,"I traded in my trouble plagued 2002 Mini, for what I thought was a major upgrade.  I purchased my 2012 Base Model Mini with manual transmission last Aug. with 31,000 miles.  While driving down to my favorite eatery, shifting from 1st to 2nd shifter know came off in my hand.  I managed to replace it and continued on.  A couple of days later a aprox. 32,000 miles I began to notice a clatter from the engine at first start up in the morning, during the next few weeks it became progressively worse.  I took it to the local Mini dealer and was informed the clatter was the clutch failing.  Being a mechanic for 40 plus years I called BS, told them to keep the car for a cold start test the next day.  Low and behold it was determined the timing chain was at fault, these engines apparently have chain tensioners prone to failure.  The timing chain was replaced along with tensioners and  gears.  The dealer Seattle Mini stuck by their story that my clutch was failing and would be 2400.00 to replace, but offered me an extended warranty that would cover the clutch for 1895.00.  What a way to cover the cost of the warranty work. About 2 weeks after having the work down, the engine began to misfire badly, had it towed to the dealer, they replaced the coil packs for the ignition, and spark plugs and wires.  So here we are today, 41,102 miles, the engine is beginning to clatter again from the exact same location.  Under warranty to 50,000 miles.  Soon as it gets worse to justify the warranty work and before 50,000 miles back in again for another timing chain, followed by a quick trade in for another car, not MINI.  Oh and did I mention that Seattle Mini tried the whole your clutch is failing routine on me a 2nd time with offer of the extended warranty when I took it in for the Misfire problem I mentioned earlier.  By the way the clutch still works perfect, however the manual transmission has always been clunky when shifting, the transition from 1st to 2nd requires a firm pull, it also has no reverse lock out, on 2 separate occasions I have been at a light and forgot to downshift into first, while quickly doing so as to not block traffic, it went into reverse.  Luckily caught it before I hit someone behind me.  Been driving manual for years.

I am a commuter from a rural area into a college town and was looking for an economy car, but not one that was underpowered or cheap. This is likely to be the brand I stick with for awhile, they are SO fun to drive and cannot be beat in city traffic (only two wheels have it better). It feels safe because you know that the car has very respectable handling and power to get you around, and deal with occasional poor drivers on the open roads. Rather expensive based on size alone, it has taken the miles and years of ownership to gain a greater appreciation. *September 2020, still have the car (88k) and no intentions of getting rid of it any time soon. It is no longer a daily driver but a spirited part-time weekender, and plenty of suspension mods have been taking place. Don't get me wrong, we're just enhancing what is already tight and responsive handling...you just get greedy!

mini,cooper,2012,Ashwin, 10/03/2018,Great city car !,5,"I bought a 2012 MINI Cooper (Base Hardtop with 1.6L engine and 6 speed automatic transmission) for my wife as a birthday present and we absolutely love it ! We've owned it for about 6 months and put 5000 miles on it (had 47k when we purchased it). So far, it's been decently reliable and economical car to own. We've been averaging around 33 mpg under mixed conditions and around 38 -40 mpg on highways (the computer calculated mileage it displays is usually 2-4 mpg higher, but I'm happy it's getting the advertised mileage from the EPA/MINI). Oil changes are very cheap since it only requires 4.4 quarts and it costs less than $50 for synthetic oil+filter if you're a DIY person.  The car has very good visibility and decent cargo storage when you fold the rear seats down because let's face it, you're almost never going to have anyone sitting in the back. The stereo is excellent and all the electronics have been working perfectly. The brakes on the car are incredible which is probably because of how light the car is! The only reliability related issue we've had is a rough metallic clunky noise (sounds like a bucket of bucket of bolts) which turned out to be because of running very low on engine oil. It was particularly evident on coldstarts in the morning and would almost stall when you come to a stop even after the engine warmed up. My initial thought was that it was the infamous timing chain tensioner and I ended up replacing it during the oil change, but the part I removed was perfectly fine so it must have just been low oil causing the issue.  Thankfully, the OEM tensioner only cost me $25 and was simple to replace, and I don't have to worry about it for at least another 50k miles. I do not have any oil burning issues, so it might just be that the previous owner did not fill sufficient oil.  From a driving perspective, the throttle/engine/transmission combination is sometimes hesitant and sluggish to respond when you take off from a stop, but sport mode usually fixes that. The seats are excellent quality and won't hurt your back on a long road trip. Overall, it's a really fun car particularly in the city (road and wind noise is a little loud at highway speeds) and I'd highly recommend this car to anyone!

For 1 or 2 people just running around town to work, the grocery store, the movies or the mall Â itÂs hard to beat.

I'm not crazy about the speedometer in the middle of the car. The engine is definitely underpowered, but having a manual 6-speed makes the most it. 
Reliability-wise, the motor has developed an oil leak which is costing me a little over $600 to get fixed. Other than that, it has been reliable.

Only downside is this model year it did not have USB port that accepts thumb drives that are playable by previous cars and trucks I've owned. I also wud have liked blind spot warning and rear view camera. Dash does not wear well as to its design. Center large round thing, looks like it was pasted on as an after thought. The button on the steering wheel looks like it's been left out on the rain for 200,000 miles when the car only has 52K and the horn is not beeped by the button. Similarly, the finish on a spoke of the steering wheel has peeled off in one spot. The process of getting parts from Mini is made difficult since there is only one dealership in the large city of Atlanta as well as the surrounding counties. Fifty miles for me and that's one way. You can't buy parts from a BMW dealer either. Finally sold it. Needed more power under my right foot.

Now, less than a week after its second service I am sitting on the side of the freeway, waiting the hour and a half for Mini Roadside Assistance to come get me.

So much for BMW quality.

Update:  I finally threw in the towel.  The month of January was spent in loaner cars.  The car went through coils and spark plugs.  BMW wouldn’t honor the court ordered warranty.  While it was behaving itself I pawned it off on a Honda dealership for a 2018 Fit.  I was able to get enough from the Mini to make three years worth of Honda payment.  Never again a BMW product.

mini,cooper,2013,Jordan, 03/19/2019,DO NOT BUY A MINI COOPER S,1,"This car handles great, gets great gas mileage, etc., but there is a problem with the engine that BMW hasn't acknowledged: Excessive carbon buildup. The S models have direct fuel injection engines, so no matter what fuel you use or what additives cleaners you use, you will experience excessive carbon buildup on the engine valves at ridiculously low mileage. My 2013 Mini Cooper S has fewer than 40,000 miles and is already misfiring due to carbon buildup. There are hundreds of forum posts about this. Nobody has come up with a solution other than to have the carbon deposits sandblasted off at regular intervals. Any fix-in-a-can remedies are untested at best. My local mechanic says only Mini dealerships have the tool necessary for sandblasting the valves, so this is clearly something that Mini knows about.

UPDATE: The Mini dealership ruled out carbon buildup as the cause of the misfire. Instead, it’s a faulty engine computer. It’s normally over $2k, but Mini has a half assed program to replace it for about $1,900. THEY KNOW THAT CARBON BUILDUP AND FAULTY COMPUTERS ARE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR CARS, but a recall has never been issued.

These are fun cars, but the litany of problems straight from the factory floor and their unwillingness to issue recalls makes them more trouble than they’re worth.

mini,cooper,2013,par404, 09/06/2013,Fun car to drive,4,"I had larger cars in the past and decided to venture out for a smaller fun car. The MINI is all this and more. Hugs the road with great handling, great fuel economy, tightly built and dependable. The car takes premium fuel. The dealer had indicated you can get away with regular or mid-grade. Do not try it. You will lose the driving performance you hear in some other reviews. Otherwise, do not regret buying it and still having fun after one year."
mini,cooper,2013,hippiechick, 11/25/2013,Fun Car but Mini Service is Bad!,3,"Beware - Mini service is the pits!
I loved my Mini until something happened to it.
I was hit and my car had some minor damage.
I took it to an authorized dealer.
First time - my door wouldn't open when I got home and my tail lights were messed up.
I have now taken it twice to repair the same issue - second time they left parts in the back.


Mini corporate tells me my only recourse is to take it back to the same dealership.
Isn't that super!!!
Will never buy another one even though I like the car.
You have to have a car that you can get fixed when you need work done.

Also, run tires do not work - pull over immediately!!!"
mini,cooper,2013,lindigo, 04/01/2014,Your speedometer won't be even close to accurate,3,"Before you buy, do a search on Mini Cooper + speedometer so you will know inaccurate speedometers are their policy. I asked them to recalibrate my speedometer which is running about 7% high. They refused, quoting an internal bulletin not to repair speedometers that are within 10% of accurate plus another 2.4 miles. I.e., if you and your Garmin know you are driving at 65 mph, your speedometer will not be recalibrated unless it is displays OVER 74 mph.
So much for their claim that they fix new cars.
I even bought the extra coverage so this ""guarantee"" would continue for extra years.
I would never buy another Mini Cooper. Still talking, but I may have to sue to get my new car fixed."
mini,cooper,2013,norcalcommuter, 11/13/2013,Horrible interior design & engineering/road noise,4,"People are going to get this mini because its ""cute"" and has ""style"". Maybe you buy into Mini's whole ""lifestyle"" and marketing gimmicks. I think you either love this car or hate it. My wife loves it, I hate it.  Its her daily driver, so there you go.  Its a small car. I knew that. Realize you are basically buying a 2 seat micro-car.  I'm 5-8 and skinny and think this car feels cramped, and i grew up driving all models of small air cooled VW's.  You might as well fold the back seats down and use it as trunk space.  My 8 & 10 year olds have no leg room and barely get space to plant their feet when 5'-4"" mom is driving.  Don't tell me adults can fit back there! I *Hate* the Mini-Connected system with it's joystick and horrible look/software. Confusing, not user friendly. In the world of touch screen everywhere, this lack of, is archaic. The seatbelts get caught between the seats and door post. You have to open the door to get your buckle. The seats are hard to adjust to get right and comfortable. Too many confusing dash switches. Hard to get to the back seat. Ugh, glad I leased not bought!!!  If you like the old school, kind of meets the future, this is your car. Mini holds onto stuff like retro toggle switches, the big bezel dial like speedometer, but then puts a tiny digital box on top of the steering column with a digital speedo, outside weather temp, etc, but it takes like 5 different presses of a button to get to different parts of the display and the screen is too small to be useful. Spring for the black wheels. The stock silver are always dirty and a pain to get and keep clean. I gave up.

***Update*** 2016: After 3 years, glad I am turning the car back in at the end of the lease. If you really want a mini, test drive an ""S"" and the standard engine. I think the standard is underpowered. The freeway noise (lack of noise insulation throughout the car) and the god awful mini connected interface are the worst things about this car. Don't fall for the sales pitch to buy the extended tire care warranty. The run-flat tires are expensive to replace, but not as fragile as the dealer makes them out to be. They made claims that curbs and potholes would cause them to blow out easy.  Never had an issue with them, not even a nail in the tire...

I've had one major issue the entire time I've owned her and the service center thought it was caused by something on the road. Now that my extended warranty is up, I realize that maintenance can be pricey. I'm hesitant to take it anywhere other the Mini service center as they do use specialized parts/training."
mini,cooper,2014,Jon, 08/28/2015,"25,000 mile engine",2,"First of all, I bought the car brand new, knowing that I would put a lot of miles on it. The warranty seemed perfectly acceptable and we were very happy with the purchase. We put about 25,000 miles on this car in one year and we only brought it in for oil changes and recall repairs. So far, so good. The car handles well, gets good MPG, and does what we expect it to do. Then, the car broke down while my wife was driving through town, on her way home from work.

The dealer took about one week to diagnose the problem, claiming the service department was short-handed. The following week, I was told that the turbo charger would need to be replaced, and when I checked in two days later, the engine also needed to be replaced. I have owned several new cars, and I have never had a problem with the engine in the first year of driving. In fact, I have never had engine problems within the first 100,000 miles of any engine. Naturally, I was concerned. I asked about replacement parts, and of course, the exact same OEM parts that had failed already were being installed. I tell them that's fine, but I would like to have an extended warranty so that these new parts, including the engine, would be covered for longer in case the same problem repeats. This was also denied. I have spoken to MINI USA several times, and there is nothing they will do that is not already covered. 

Please understand, the car is well within warranty and I have incurred no additional cost. Not yet, anyway. However, the car has been in the shop for three weeks now, and counting. Getting an extended warranty is pointless now, because I will be unloading this car at my earliest opportunity. I will replace my MINI with a reliable car, and never consider purchasing another in the future.

I’ve been driving it for nearly a year and have put about 7,000 miles on it. No issues aside from some weatherstrip peeling up on the passengers window. I use this car primarily for my daily commute- and this car is hands down my favorite thing about my day. I LOVE driving home with the top down on summer nights. Only car I have ever aimlessly driven around just to drive.

I have driven it up to 6 consecutive hours and it was a champ. Definitely expect road noise on the highway, but I love how quick I can get up to speed. Comfortable in the front seat. I’ve never had someone ride in the back for very long, but I did not buy the car as a passenger vehicle. If you intend to have more than two people in the car, I wouldn’t recommend it.

mini,cooper,2014,R.A.L., 07/19/2019,Mini blast!,5,"The MINI is by far one of the most unique cars available.  The interior is like nothing else out there. The design options are endless and you can truly make it your own. I do recommend a manual transmission if you really want to ""motor hard"" as the display says when you put it in sport mode. I've owned both and the 6 speed takes this pocket rocket to the next level. Test drive one and you'll be hooked. It just looks fun and is fun.

mini,cooper,2015,The Roadster, 12/06/2016,Princess and Always in the shop,1,"This is the worst car that I have ever owned.  I have had a alpha romeo spider veloce, honda crv and one other car for over 10 years each with over 150,000 miles on them.  This car is cheaply and poorly made and was more expensive than both of them.  In the first year that I owned it all of the electrical wiring went and I had to have it towed in, less than 7,000 miles.  Covered by the warranty $8,000 plus.  The following winter the water pump went and I had to have it towed in yet again.  In year 3 the drivers seat started to frwy whith less than 20,000 miles.  Last year the brakes were falling apart and they had to be changed when the car only had about 24,000 miles on it.  I am at the dealer yet again 6 months later and although I purchased an extended warranty most of it isn't covered.  $600 plus to have the hood fixed because it won't open because the original cheap parts have rusted in 4 years.  Another $400 plus for new spark plugs and something else because the engine is malfunctioning with only 31,000 miles in the car.  Another oil change because all the oil leaked and I couldn't get to it since the cable broke to open the hood.  Inferior parts and quality.  Run from this vehicle and buy a Honda, Toyota or Subaru.  I can not recommend this car to anyone and will never buy another.  But at least it's paid for!

mini,cooper,2015,Dr. Henry Mullaney, 12/19/2015,BMW doesn't honor its warranty,4,"Mini Cooper provides a 3 year warranty on the car, but BMW refuses to honor it.  BMW makes the engine, clutch, and transmission for Mini Cooper.  To simplify logistics, they use the same clutch on all their Mini drive chains.  As an engineer, I know that the first rule for choosing a clutch for a car is that it should be able to handle the torque produced by the engine.  The Mini clutch was designed for the standard 140 HP Mini engine.  The JCW comes with 208 HP.  To make matters worse, the Mini clutch is backwards from standard clutches.  During shifting, the clutch disengages the transmission and not the engine.  That means that the thrust bearing continues to rotate while handling a lot of load.  The standard half inch steel bearing cannot hold up to the 208 HP engine.  There is an easy fix to this problem which engineers know about.  You replace the half inch steel bearing with a three quarter inch ceramic bearing made to handle the horsepower.  To save less that $10 per car, BMW decided not to do this.  Therefore their clutches wear out.  The last time my clutch failed, about 2 years after purchase with a three year warranty, BMW refused to pay for my warranty repair, and I am out about $2000.  
I asked my dealer to use a heavy duty clutch which I would buy during this last repair.  But their contract with Mini Cooper doesn't allow them to use any parts but BMW parts.  BMW tells me that I do not know how to drive a clutched car.  I have driven Saabs with standard transmissions and clutches for over 20 years and have never had a clutch failure.  I currently drive a 1999 Saab 9-3 convertible with 150,000 miles on it, with the original clutch still working fine.

Love the sound system, Harmon Kardon. Now HATE !!! gauges are impossible  to see ( small letters n numbers) without reading glasses ! yes I'm over 50. poor contrast at night ,dark red on black when the lights are on. Oh but during daylight hrs, its white on black. What the @#$% are you thinking ?  Clunk noise in suspension making me nuts , The dealer cant seem to ""replicate"", I have to take service tech for a ride to show him . Oh yea I hear it . Assured me everything is indeed A OK. Still clunks over bumps. $30,000.00 clunker I guess. I think they want me to go away and just make my payments and be quiet.  Gasket coming out of side window !! Really ? BMW product ? 10k miles the windshield shows pitting !  No dipstick to check oil ?  The radio is impossible to navigate , to complexed. That could be the over 50 issue, I'm sorry.                                                                                       1/29/2017  Dealer replaced rear shocks , I told them that I was not going to take the car back until it was fixed at first oil change .

mini,cooper,2015,guypou, 05/05/2015,pleased,5,"I am very pleased so far. Build quality and design make it a great deal to own.
It came with 16 inches runflat tires so the ride is on the firm side but more compliant than the previous model I had. I must admit that on deteriorated pavements at low speed it is not where it shines, otherwise the drive is rewarding.
The options include most packages except HK radio, connectivity and gps, the leather seats are really nice and comfortable.
I used to drive in a more spirited way, the green setting made me zen to some point so I get an average of 35 mpg in mix driving so far.
After one year and 10000 miles, I got a real average of 33.6 mpg on a mostly city driving which is impressive, the computer indicates around 35.
The sports seats with leather option are comfortable but non tilt adjustable which is a major issue, since leather and sport seats are a 2000$ option.
Technology is very basic, there is no back up camera etc, I would have expected more on a car with that price tag.
Keep on driving, at the wheel you are in another world.

mini,cooper,2015,wareagle06, 03/02/2015,Love My MINI,4,This car was originally not my first choice. I took one test drive and from that point I was hooked. I was looking for an every day driver that was also fun and I found it in the MINI. It really does have go-kart like handling. The interior is well built with quality materials. The performance is outstanding (I have the S model with the 2.0 twinpower turbo engine). What really sold me was the no cost maintenance. 
mini,cooper,2015,Dr. Henry Mullaney, 10/07/2015,BMW does not honor warranty on clutch,3,"The clutch is backwards from most cars.  When you step on the clutch of most cars, the clutch separates from the engine.  In a Mini, it remains attached to the engine, and the thrust bearing rotates with the engine with a lot of force on this half inch steel bearing.  The flywheel is a dual mass, suitable for today's drivers who do not know how to let out a clutch.  Finally, clutches are supposed to match the horsepower of the engine.  The clutch is sized for the standard 124 HP engine.  The JCW has the same engine, but with tuning and turbo puts out 208 HP.  The clutch in my Mini has now been replaced 4 times in 36000 miles of driving.  BMW which owns Mini runs it's warranty program.  95% of their calls involve BMWs.  BMW uses a traditional clutch and its clutches are matched to the engine.  So they do not understand the problems faced by Mini JCW owners.  I have a 4 year 50,000 warranty on my car, purchased in June 2012.  Yet BMW refuses to pay the $1700 bill to replace my clutch.  Heavy duty clutches are available for the Mini because the clutch fails so often.  They cost $1300.  They have a ceramic bearing that won't burn out.  Mini dealers have special equipment to replace clutches because they break so often.  It costs about $5000.  So chances are that your mechanic does not have this equipment.  My Mini dealer refuses to even touch a heavy duty clutch since their agreement with Mini USA requires them to only use Mini parts, which are unreliable.
If you buy a Mini JCW, you can expect the clutch to fail about once a year.  It takes 3 days to get a clutch installed.

mini,cooper,2015,Tana, 06/24/2016,I love my mini baby!,5,"This is a funny little car.  It has a lot of pep.  It's so fun to drive!  And it has a distinct, cute style. So I can forgive many other things that aren't perfect, such as a tight fit getting in and out of the car.  You learn ""how"" to get in and out of the car, so it works.  My husband is 6'2"" and weighs 270lb.  He has learned how to get in and says it is comfortable for him to drive and be a front passenger, but he can't sit in the back seat.  My adult child is not small and she can sit in the back seat comfortably.  The back cargo area has enough space for me to get a weeks worth of groceries in to. If we have other larger things we need to haul, we can put the seats down and it usually works.  It's not an SUV, so doesn't have the room that an SUV has.  We have to have bigger items delivered. My other choice of car was a Subaru Forester XT touring, but it was too expensive to get what I wanted and the navigation and bluetooth on it weren't nearly as good as my mini.   The dealership I bought my mini at only sold their cars with summer tires.  I would have liked all season tires which would be better in the snow.  I love the navigation system, I will upgrade it every other year or so.  I like the bluetooth, the streaming music, the folding mirrors, the acceleration, the handling, The bottom line...When you step on the gas, it goes...fast. And,....I get better gas mileage than was stated on the window sticker.  Update: Dec 2016. We drove to ID. So glad we decided to get snow tires. The handling isn't sporty. But we can drive in snow. We would not have been able to get around without them, even with all season tires. We will have them stored for when we make winter trips. On this trip we are discovering that there is just not enough room in this car for our needs. Thinking of getting a 2017 Mini Countryman, but then it looks like an SUV and not a mini. I still love the way this one drives though.

mini,cooper,2015,Dennis, 04/02/2017,"Dealer Eventually Sold Me My New Mini for $20,000",5,"I love my Mini Cooper.  I can hardly believe how incredibly powerful the little 3 cylinder Turbo is!  And, as someone who commutes 94 miles a day round trip from Virginia (DC area) to Baltimore, the average 38-41 MPG is really great for such a solid, powerful, road-hugging little car.  I knew I would love owning the Mini after I test drove it; however, price was a sticking point.  Consumer literature said you could get a Mini for $20,000 if you went with the 6 speed standard transmission base model, which was exactly what I wanted.  Over the course of 6 months or so, I kept checking back with my salesman to make clear I would buy one if they sold it to me for $20K.  He called me one day and said they had a brand new red Mini that someone had won in a raffle -- because it was a stick, they brought it back to the dealer.  I bought it with full warranty (no destination charge) and got it for $20K.  It had 34 miles on it.  The only things I find mildly problematic  is that folks can't hear me very well on bluetooth, and my hips get sore with all the commuting (can't seem to find a driver's seat adjustment that works for me).  All in all, a powerful, good-looking little sports car...I'm happy!

It's very practical, but in an extremely fun way. The ride, handling, performance, gas mileage, acceleration, and storage capability (with the rear seats down) are superb for a car of this class. Fit and finishes are great on the newer models, especially, with improved ride (sporty, yet forgiving) and the Harman Kardon sound system, which will blow you away. This car is built to last. And, the 4-cylinder turbocharged engine is definitely the only way to go. It provides plenty of get-up-and-go...especially on the highway and for longer trips.

I have contacted Mini...they say it's Apple...Apple says it's Mini...Meanwhile dealerships don't seem to have the answers either...not enough training at some of the high tech levels at some of the dealerships...I found a round about way to do so by connecting Pandora...but then I was using data...Upon further research of this problem, it appears there have been others with similar problems which still have not been addressed by Mini.  I did get Mini Corp and Apple on the phone together today.  Mini says they are looking into it and will get back to me...so I can't judge or say for certain what the outcome will be...but it is frustrating not to be able to get my navigation through the speakers.  Other than that the car drives great.  Amazing amount of power in this little guy.  Seats are extremely comfortable.  I love the heated seats during the cold winter days.  Like the added side visor on the driver's side of the car...perfect to keep that sun out of your eyes.  Sound system of Harman Kardon is great! More room than you think in the 4 door once seats are down.  Nice area to hide valuables in the back storage area as well.  Wish the keyless entry was just a simple touch with a finger instead of a push...but not I'm getting picky.  Also wish the fob created a sound from the car when you pressed it...that always helped me find my car.  Not as stiff a ride as I though it would be...big improvements from previous models.  Also, it's getting just ok gas mileage...I was spoiled by a Prius C before though.  This one eats Premium. But all in all, I think it's a very attractive vehicle and once I get this nagging navigation situation resolved will like it even better!  PS Did not like the ""S"" seats...I found them not so great for short people...However, I have heard that taller people really like them.  Glad I had a choice.

One of my favorite things is that MINI gave creative thought to the small things like where the gas tank is located, the way your MINI will wink at you when you get in, the heartbeat of the car, mood lighting etc. Even though it has all these fun things the car is crazy safe, like the gas tank cut off if you are in an accident to keep from fire, the 8 air bags and so many other things. I would highly recommend this car to anyone because it's more than just cute and fun but safe and reliable.

mini,cooper,2015,Eliot, 11/19/2015,Not If You Owned & Liked Previous BMW MINI's,3,"The point of view of this review is from a long time BMW MINI owner who, up until now, loved them.  It probably isn't relevant to those who haven't previously had a MINI.  Back in the '60, Ford had a great, innovative car that was very popular.  Each new version of it became bigger and bigger and sought to reach a wider market.  Eventually, it became a parody of itself, becoming virtually a 2 door family sedan.  Fortunately, Ford saw the light and the car has returned (sort of) to its roots. I am referring to the Mustang.  Well, it seems BMW is following that same sorry route with the MINI.  What was the attraction of the BWM MINI?  It's SMALL size, its uniqueness, its fun to drive-ness. As one local reviewer (in Maryland) wrote, driving a MINI was therapy.  So, what has happened.  To address the ""negatives"" appearing in professional reviews, which value every car against some homogeneous (with the exception, perhaps, of exotics and rockets), BMW is turning the MINI into just another compact car.  They have tried to make up for this by adding high-tech gimmickry, like color-changing LEDs and artificial sound effects, which serve only to make a cartoon out of the car.  The car has gotten huge compared to the previous MINIs. If you are buying this car for rear seat room and a living room on wheels ride, you are in the wrong place.  The 2015/2016 MINI hardtops are almost indistinguishable from the Countryman, both viewed from the outside and when sitting inside. This isn't because the Countryman is tiny.  On the technical side, one could say everything is ""improved"" except for the 3 cylinder engine in the base model. While it is surprisingly peppy, it is noisy and rough-idling.  Yes, there are now many MINIs on the road. So, from BMW's perspective, they are on the right path. But, if you are a Miniac for the initial BMW MINI offerings, you will most likely not be happy driving this one.  Let's hope BMW, like Ford, will come to its senses.  Eventually, Mr./Ms. average driver will tire of the cramped size, the ""hard"" ride and the ""weird"" stuff that might still remain and those who remember what a MINI was will return.  In the meantime, I'll probably be in a Miata or a GTI.

UPDATE: I no longer have a MINI. I test drove a 219 Countryman S and Cooper S. The quality is definitely up considerably. The ride is quieter and smoother. BUT, they just aren't MINIs anymore.  While there is still some unique and fun features, the prices are getting too high. A fully equipped Countryman S at $44,000.

mini,cooper,2015,MJ, 01/15/2019,Love it!,5,"2015 JCW 2 dr convertible owner. Really great car!  I'm not sure how I could ever become a non-Mini-driver now in terms of feeling the drive. Punchy acceleration and wonderful cornering; whipping through traffic and easy to park. What's not to like?
"
mini,cooper,2015,ROCKY, 08/14/2019,It is what it is...,4,"I have the 2015 MINI Cooper Convertible, automatic.   

When my 2 oldest kids moved out and my youngest started driving on his own we figured we did not need 2 full sized SUV's with third row seats anymore.   But I would never drive one of those lame cheap cars like a fiat, smartcar or a spark.  I also did not want some boring sedan.  
 I am very picky.  I honestly figured I would end up with yet another mustang or something to that effect.

We came across the MINI sort of by accident.  My husband pointed it out and I said no b/c I did not want a convertible or an automatic  transmission ... plus my husband is 6' 1"",  240 lbs and broad shouldered so i figured he would not fit in it because he did not fit in my Nissan sport coupe comfortably.  but my husband said it ""suited me"" because it had a cheeky custom paint job and he talked me into a test drive.  We were both super surprised by the TARDIS tech built into the thing.  He fit very comfortably and the seat went back like 8 inches further than he even needed it to and there was a good 6 inches of head room.  In the end It was purchased because it gets great gas mileage and it was pretty cheap and the car insurance on it was surprisingly much less than most cars.  

The funny thing is we bought it because it was practical but it is actually super fun.  The handling is great, I was really surprised at that.  It is pretty decent off the line and fun to drive.  It gets great gas mileage and I do really like it.  I get compliments all the time.  It is perfect for running small errands in the city or heading to dinner etc.  My son is 6' tall and I have had him and one of his friends in the back for short trips with no complaints.  You can fit several bags of groceries in the trunk with no problem.

It does have a few draw backs.  
1.  The visibility with the top up is horrible...  like to the point that it is a bit scary sometimes.  
2.  It's well ... mini. We get away with it b/c we have the full size SUV as well.  I do not see how this could be your only car.  There is no way you could make a trip to Sams Club even for a few things.  The trunk opening is just too small.  I don't even see how we could take it on a road trip.  Any more than weekender bags would not even fit in the trunk.
3.  It's loud.  This does not bother me but it is much louder than any other car I have had.
4.  Things are in strange places.  IE: you can't roll the windows up or unlock the door if there is a drink in the cup holder because the toggle switches for both of these are in the center of the car behind the gear shift and the drink holders.  It makes no sense. 
5.  You cant lock the car unless you are all the way out of it and all the doors are already shut.
This doesn't sound like a big deal but If you have to keep your keys out it is really hard to even grab a bag of McD's and your drink and shut the door. I have never seen this in another vehicle.  

All in all it's a fun car to drive with a bit of an attitude.  It seems well built, we have not had any problems and I do like it!

mini,cooper,2015,Alexis, 01/04/2020,"Fun to Drive, Not to Repair!",2,"I've had my Mini for about 4 years now, and I absolutely love driving it... when it works. The interior is very upscale and fairly easy to keep clean, my German Shepherd fits just fine in the backseat, and this car handles sharp turns and corners like no other. However, I've had over $20,000 worth of repairs and maintenance since I got it- it's almost insane! The car actually broke down on me within the first year, had to get the crank pulley replaced. Then a wire inside one of the headlight housings broke and the dealership wanted $800 to replace the whole headlight since they didn't sell that $12 part individually. The last straw for me was the dealership wanting $400 to replace the battery. Even the repair guy at the MINI dealership pulled me to the side and warned me that it'll only get worse after 50k miles... and I recently discovered that my boss is upside down in her MINI because of the same issues. So basically, if you're okay with throwing money at this car you'll love it. If not, please save yourself and look elsewhere. I'm sad to say it, but I'll never go back to Mini or BMW.

mini,cooper,2015,Maria, 08/20/2015,Some changes: #1 Rule: It's a MINI. Get Over It,5,"This is an update to my initial review.  I've got some 6,000 miles on it now.  Combined mileage is 34 mpg.  Freeway driving is a breeze, as long as you, the driver, realized your MINI Cooper (non-turbo) is no race or fast car.  It's a very simple 1600 cc's of raw BMW power.  They should use that line in their advertisements.  The car and its payment went to my ex-husband when I left him.  He wanted it.  He loves it.  At 74"" he is very comfortable in the car with top up or down.  So, the rest of this review is his.   

Toby, that is her name, performs exactly the way I had hoped she would perform.  Whether in the city (stop or go traffic) or on the highway, she does an excellent job.  I do not drive her fast.  She simply isn't fast.  I didn't want ""fast"" so, she is perfect.  For me.  At my age.  I got this car because it was a convertible, leather interior, a wonderful color combination for the exterior with a very comfortable ride and superior sound system.  Toby is a Highgate package with the Harmon-Kardon sound system (a 'must-have' in my mind).  I truly cannot think of anything else to say about the car, as it is just a superb automobile in spite of its price tag.  I got what I wanted: A well thought-out, high mileage, comfortable drop-top.  When I'm 80, please stay off the sidewalks.  I'll be driving on them!

mini,cooper,2016,Jim, former parts guy,To those with poor performance,5,"Read owners manual, this is a high compression engine and should only get 93 octane fuel. Preferably without 10% alcohol. Mine gets 3-5 better mpg without alcohol. As far as hesitation, power loss, use a high grade DETERGENT fuel injection cleaner like Lucas. Those cheap brand names are just a solvent that dissolves solids in your gas tank and they move up to your injectors. ( I bought a cheap 07 MINI because it was running rough, after 2 tanks with Lucas in it it runs like new!) I would run it in 2 consecutive tanks of gas, then 2-4 times a year depending on more or less than 12k per year."

Handling is superb... we have the base trim with 3 cylinder, but the 172 max torque makes a quick spin and cornering capability.  16 inch sport wheels and tires provide just the right amount of road holding ability and stopping power.  We have the 195/16 runflat tires as part of the sport package.  Navigator is great, clear instruction and great voice command functions.  Rear view camera and parking sensors work perfectly for tight parking spots.  The seats are very comfortable.  We love the dual sunroofs as well, and the Harmon Kardon sound system with unlimited tweeter sound and bass.  The exhaust note is sporty.  Our out-of-the-door price was $27,350 with $5,500 discount right around 2015 X'mas time.  Dealer even gave us rear tinted windows for free.  Nice!!  Thanks.

mini,cooper,2016,fchadly, 08/18/2016,Watch out for MINI customer service,3,"Update 19FEB18
I wound up selling the car as it just was not to my practical use of going back and forth to work anymore.  Our family only needs one good vehicle with one payment which our Ram 1500 crew cab serves us very well.  There was no maintenance issues or anything when I got rid of it, but for what I was paying monthly it was just not worth keeping anymore when I can get by with a $2000 car.

The car runs drives great and is surprisingly smooth going down the highway at 80mph for a short wheelbase auto.  My problem with MINI is their customer service after the sale.  So my wife and I get 60mi outside the Dallas dealership and decide to set up the Sat radio that supposedly came with the car.  After fumbling with the radio trying to find the ""Sat"" setting, I called my sales person back to ask where the setting was, he said he needed to call me back.  A few minutes later we were informed our car is ""Sat Prep"" which means me as the owner has to take the car in at MY expense, buy a $150 Sat code followed by $700 to install software in my factory NAV headset.  This was not explained to us prior to leaving the dealership.  When we called the sales manager back to get this worked out, it was an instant ""there is nothing we can do, we should have worked it into the original deal"".  So at that point when it came to the survey about the dealership, I wrote what happened and in a couple of days got a call from a Dewey Gatts customer relations supervisor on my voicemail to call him back.  And so I did not once, but three times over the course of three days with no phone call back.  Got a hold of another customer service rep who we again laid out our issue too and she sounded promising of helping out.  She said if you have not heard anything in 24-48hrs call back.  Again I called Dewey Gatts POC, and again straight to voicemail, so I called again, got another rep ""Tara"" who was quick to just say what Sat Prep means and that their is nothing they could do.  I posted on MINI USA the following:   ""so there In addition to our previous post about some misleading advertisement about Sat Radio on our new car, we have been back and forth with MINI customer relations since we have not been able to get a call back from our case manager Dewey Gatts.  We have waited the 48hrs to hear back on our case since Dewey Gatts will not call us despite the 3 different times I left my number on his voicemail to call.  When we asked the customer relations rep named Tara who the relations supervisor was so we could get some resolve on our case (at this point she started telling us there is nothing they could do), she could not tell us who it was, Tara kept telling us the next level are all supervisors.  What?? All departments regardless of business type have ONE person/manager who is in charge and then that Manager has someone s/he has to answer to as well.  You mean to tell me you cannot tell me who your own boss is?  or who your boss' boss is?  MINI you have something seriously wrong in with your customer service reps if they cannot tell me who their direct line of supervisors are much less can provide a phone contact.  MINI has put a huge damper on my ""Motoring"" experience.  This type of customer service shows what MINI USA's true colors are in order to resolve an issue.  If anyone is thinking of buying a MINI, you better have your homework down on what you want because MINI will use any misinterpretations to their advantage and continue to blow you off until you give up.  The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I so should have bought a Fiat 500 or Chevy Spark that I was looking at in conjunction to this car. I know Ford, Dodge, and Chevy customer relations at least make an effort to right a wrong.  MINI you have just lost a customer, we were planning to trade our Ram 1500 in next year for a Countryman but that will absolutely not
 happen at this point, I will stick with American or Japanese for next purchase"".

mini,cooper,2016,David, 03/12/2016,Cute quirky w some less than ideal attributes,2,"I have my own opinions that sometimes run counter to the popular view. Case in point are some aspects of the 2016 Mini Cooper hard top. We recently bought mostly for its quirky charm unfortunately not because of its handling. 

We ordered a base cooper with the 15"" wheels but with the default performance tires. The handling isn't as good as I hoped. It has personality like the rest of the car although I'd hoped for it to just work. Steering is responsive, however the car fishtails in quick maneuvers. It fact it's one of the worst I've driven testing by swishing the steering wheel side to side. The rear reacts violently after a long delay like the back is whipping around later. Can be scary on the expressway. We tried 16"" wheels and they're a little better but not great. Many other cars this size do better on this test. 
The other thing I don't like is the Harmon Kardon upgraded stereo. It has way too much bass. If that all you want to hear, maybe it's fine but I rank it as practically unlistenable even with the bass turned way down. The Fender upgraded stereo in VWs are awesome. Awesome bass yet clarity. 
We didn't order the upgraded stereo. The base stereo is fine and sounds clearer. 
The little 1.5 liter 3 cylinder engine is great. Has lots of low end torque, is happy to rev, and is surprisingly quiet. 
Manual transmission is very good. Nice fairly short throw. Rev matching on downshifts, hill hold. 
I test drove automatics. It works well in most cases but I got it confused when I jumped out in traffic and it took an eternity (maybe a second or two) to decide what gear to go into, all while cars were bearing down on me. 
Interior is small but can be comfortable is people aren't too big. 
Sunroof is amazing. Feels like your in a convertible. 
Overall ride is very solid. Stiff body, normally few rattles, good at absorbing bumps. 
Storage space is definitely lacking. Mini went cheap for 2016 and removed the secret compartment on the dashboard reducing storage space that's practically non existent. 
Who's idea was it to make a four door car and only have one cupboard in the rear seat?
Overall a fun cute car but with sometimes poor handling with the base wheels.

Update 9/2017
The cuteness has worn off. 
Acceleration, although still good, has lots of hesitation especially in 2nd gear. The car is especially sensitive to bad gas. I have to run the best premium or it drives like a bucking bronco. It is not fun. Even with good premium is still hesitates. It is not possible to smoothly shift this car. The computer is in too much control of the engine RPMs. Rev matching is ok when downshifting, but when upshifting, the engine is VERY slow to rev down. The end result is that the engine is ALWAYS going too fast for the next gear up. Giving it any gas makes it worse. Its simply very hard if not impossible to get a smooth shift especially around 2nd gear. Again the computer software is to blame. They dynamically change the throttle map on each gear. 1st gear is pretty mild. You can give it lots of gas and not go anywhere, but 2nd goes the other way and is very aggressive. Very sensitive to throttle position. 3rd and up and more forgiving.

The base radio still sounds awful. Even with the bass turned all the way down there can still be too much booming bass, but its just at one frequency. Frequencies below or above are cut out so you don't hear them at all.

The control software of the car drives me crazy. Like its possessed. All sorts of random behavior. My favorite is me having the AC turned off, the button clearly shows the AC is turned off, yet the AC is running and on blowing ice cold air even if I don't want it on. A few minutes later the gremlin lets go and it will silently shut off. This happens at random inconsistent times. I have not been able to find a pattern.

I randomly get door unlocks, warnings messages on the screen about
 start/stop being disabled, persistent chime about passenger not wearing seat belt... when there is no passenger! Which reminds me, start/stop didn't work for me once, just once, leaving me slowly rolling through a downtown busy intersection. Eventually flipped enough buttons it started up again. Thought it was broken, but eventually tried it again and it hasn't recurred. 

Overall the car is doing ok I guess. But whenever I drive it I'm greatly bothered by the hesitation and rough shifting. Bad stereo doesn't help. In retrospect, I wish I would have bought something less annoying.

Update 2/2018
We ditched the car and haven’t looked back. Was a bad experience. I wouldn’t buy a Mini again. Manual transmission failing. Major shudder when lifting clutch sometimes.

This Mini is not a durable car, and should never be purchase with more than 50,000 miles. I receive class-action lawsuit notices against Mini on all the issues I've had to deal with almost every three months. Obviously, I'm not the only owner dealing with these re-occurring issues. My advice is to stay away from this vehicle unless you have unlimited funds for repair or know a Mini repairman who works extremely cheap.

mini,cooper-clubman,2008,Virginia, 11/02/2010,"It was fun, but",4,"Blast to drive, easy to park, nice to look at.  Fun car, oddly tons of room inside, even for really tall people.  Fit big dog in, could buy dozens of bags of groceries, versatile.  Very poor driver in the snow- front wheel drive torque could easily get away from driver.  Sun roof was really nice-  large opening nearly like a convertible.  Excellent vision for highway driving, excellent pick up for on ramps.   But, not seen on highway easily at all, not seen in traffic, chippy on pavement when shifting, so light it jumped over joints in road, moving sideways a bit, and some fit and finish issues, quality issues.  Sound system, even with premium, not so great.  Utterly superb gas mileage!"
mini,cooper-clubman,2008,Branden, 05/20/2009,Sweet rally car with seating for four.,4,"Picked this up in Kansas city and drove it home 7 hours.  It has amazing torque and cornering.  Very comfortable for road trips, with firm seats and real lumbar support with the upgraded upholstery.  It does have a very firm ride, and the sport package is only for masochists.  I plan on switching out the run flats when they wear out with regular tires to ease the bumpiness.  The roads here in Minnesota are bad.  If you can find a twisty road it is sublime.  I test drove all the varieties, and I think the Auto base is a bit underpowered.  The Manual base is ok.  Obviously the S in either version rocks.  But switch the MPH over to the RPM gauge, as I hit 100 when passing without noticing."

I have had FOUR yes FOUR turbo's replaced. The fuel injectors replaced and the sunroof adjusted 4 times for excessive noise. I have had it in the shop in San Antonio,Houston and Austin. Customer service is terrible because they do not communicate with me. I have to call them to find out what the issue is.I have asked for some assistance from Mini and they will not help. They make it sound as it's my fault the car is always in the shop. I have not driven the car for 2 consecutive days since Sept 17th. Stay AWAY from mini!"
mini,cooper-clubman,2008,Bart, 06/04/2008,Cooper Clubman,5,"Clubamn is an excellent drive. Use for business, wanted regular Mini S but tools would not fit. Clubman gives plenty of room. Great mileage, even with super unleaded. Drive 400+ miles on a tank of gas. Hard to stuff more than 12 gallons when empty. Fun to drive, have to be careful not to get too fast, ride is so smooth that speed can get away from you."
mini,cooper-clubman,2008,QualMod, 07/06/2008,Love my Clubman,5,"Highly recommend the Clubman. Great on gas mileage (drove to Reno NV and back from San Francisco on one tank), and is a very cool looking vehicle, to boot. I never cared about cars or driving before, but now I look forward to simply driving to the dentist! Perky and smooth ride at once. My dog fits in the back as does my 6'4 boyfriend in the front. Also, as the Clubman is new, it is a head-turner. I can't leave a parking lot without people drooling over it and asking me questions! "

Special ordered it from England, waited months and am incredibly disappointed. Sure, it handles nice but it's incredibly noisy (run flats), obnoxiously bouncy, shifter throw is excessive, build quality seems pretty awful - less than 1000 miles and driver's window is stuck down, rear doors misaligned on delivery, tire pressue warning stuck on, side scuttle emblems fallen off, finish on $750 extra wheels pitted and corroding; cup holders awkward & too small, interior storage awkward. Info center controls unneccessarily complicated. I really wanted to like this little car."

The turbo charged engine feels more robust and smoother compared with the prior years, and the improve fuel economy is wonderful. Overall my mileage on my 2006 (manual 6 speed) was around 29 mpg for all types of driving. With the new Clubman (manual 6 speed) I am averaging around 33 mpg for all types of driving. This is wonderful for such a high performance little engine. The extra space is terrific, and the build quality is better overall than my 2006. "

I'm getting about 32 MPG with the auto. transmission in mostly country road-type driving. Good surprise: We fit 3 adults, a teenager, a goalie hockey bag and five medium-sized grocery bags in the car for a one-day round trip, 3 hours each way, & it was comfortable, even in back, and rear visibility wasn't blocked! The car is very well engineered but had some minor defects when delivered (not a surprise), which are still being fixed after 5 weeks (a surprise). The biggest surprise is that the car is a fantastic highway cruiser! It's amazingly stable at high speeds. You don't feel the speed, so you need to be very careful that you don't go 90 in a 55!"

When gas hit $4/gal I wanted to drive something with better gas mileage. We have a Camry Hybrid which is fuel efficent and boring. I wanted something more fun and the Prius wasn't going to cut it. Once I drove the Clubman I decided it had the size I needed and the fuel mileage and fun factor I wanted. I'm getting 36 mpg overall and 42 on the highway.

Of the 3 the Mini offered the Get-Up-&-Go I was looking for with the ""S"" model.  I test drove both models on the AutoBahn here in Germany.  What really sold me was the turbo, in both 5th & 6th gear the pick up to get around other vehicles was very impressive.  I also tested the fit for my Rottie with the rear seats down she has enough room to move around realitively comfortably.  "

The Clubman was the answer. Excellent pick-up; excellent grip; great 6 speed tranny; and you gotta love the barn doors in back. Gas mileage is, of course, great; 28 city and 33 highway. The ride is also much more secure and settled on the hwy with the longer wheelbase vs the Cooper coupe. "
mini,cooper-clubman,2008,Rapp1116, 06/08/2016,Great car. I give it 5 stars but,5,"Its noisy,  the seats could be better, the bluetooth suck, the usb ports are awful. The hand free phone system is unreliable at best.  Pure and simple!  T it has other flaws and the run flat tires are brutal.  Switch the tires and ignore the rest of the sortcomings This car is F U N to drive.  You just have to avoid Mini service off warranty . It’s is awful and terribly expensive.  I have owned about 20 cars in my life .  I have never kept a car more then 4 years.  My mini is 10 years old and still going strong.  

One safety issue of note that mini doesn’t seem to acknowledge.  My rear doors come open on their own from time to time.  The car can be parked over night, just starting up or driving down the road at 100kms.  It doesn’t happen very often but ...

The original Mini was great, but lacked size to take your golf clubs to the course and god forbid if you had to have someone in the so called backseat.    Well the Clubman is the answer.  Comfortable fit golf clubs in the back, and plenty of room for 4 when needed.  Ride is better than Original Cooper.  It is a fun sports car when you want to turn it on.   Sport mode adds to the fun to have ready on power.   Through daily commuting of 75%/25% highway to city, I have averaged 32 MPG with the automatic.  "

MINI is keeping the demand high by not keeping a lot of these in stock at the dealers (at least in San Diego), which is great for resale value. This car is a blast to drive, is built with BMW quality, and is oober-styish. Must have options are bluetooth & IPOD integration, and the dual pane sunroof. I've been getting about 29 1/2 MPG as a commuter with the manual transmission (still on first tank of gas), but I can easily see getting 35-40 on highway trips (I put it on cruise @ 80 and the current MPG monitor was reading 40+).

Windows rolled down almost always because people ask what is that you're driving. Has lots of room. I'm 6'7"" and I have no trouble fitting in the tiny little car.  It seems very safe as swell with the inside of the car acting like a bubble pillow if they go off because there are so many air bags. Traded in a Pontiac Aztek for the Cooper.

 I did get an email from the dealer last week about the Evaporator plate. Now that we're in the dead of summer, I am noticing a little odor (thought it was my shoes), so they suggest the Evaporator needs to be cleaned out for $120. That's the first service item on the car, with 48,000 miles and nearly 4 years. On the highway, I still get 42 MPG. With the 6 speed, I am never without the power I need.
I travel quite a bit and met 2 BMW engineers. Both said the 6 speed base Cooper w/ sport assist is a great car. I added the stabilizer bar as the only add on...and Xenon lights. Great value. Great Car. Fun!Fun!Fun!"

mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Mini me no more, 05/24/2016,"Get rid of it before 82,000",2,"I custom order my 2009 Mini Clubman, Chili red, all the upgrades including 18"" wheels and run flats and waited three (3) months for it to be built, shipped and delivered to me 10.1.2008. It was a great ride since I had owned a MG Midget years earlier, so I knew how these little cars feel.  But, in 2015 all the problems started with engine light coming on over and over again with these dates and findings, 

1) June 2015 - Jan. 2016 a chasing oil leak four times ($ 300 a pop), 2)  
April 2015 timing chain failure (covered by Mini),  
Feb. 2016 crack in oil line ( ($750), 
March 2016 (twice in the shop) another oil leak ($675 each time).  
April 2016 when I checked the oil and found there was none in the reservoir. The idiot that had worked on my car at the dealer had forgotten to place oil back in after the second March 2016 repair (the service manager said he had been fired due to other complaints) I found this out when I left he vehicle for four (4) days stay at the dealer (I always had it serviced at the Dealer to keep the records accessible) and
April 2016 I was told another oil leak and vacuum hose issue ($1,100). 
May 2016 -A week later, the engine light was back on, this time carbon build-up ($2,700). 

I spent  total of $7,100 on this vehicle from June 2015 to May 2016. Needless to say, I sold (not traded it in) it in a private sale to a guy that collects cars and wanted a 2009 Mini. He did not care about the issues, he just wanted the car and paid the price I asked. It was shipped from Charleston, SC to San Diego, CA on his dime. I purchased a 2016 Outback. Why? I just could not bring myself to trust the Mini mechanics after the oil misstep.

mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Fam, 02/04/2019,Cute Car with an UGLY soul lol..,3,"It looks good but it’s not good once it gets old. :) I bought my 2009 Mini Cooper Clubman with about 57K miles on it from the original owner. I thought I got a great deal. On the way home from purchasing, the engine started misfiring to my dismay. Got it home, researched it and saw these have a design flaw that can cause the engine cylinders to slip under heat, usage, etc. which is thousands of dollars to repair. There was also a suggestion of changing the spark plugs & ignition coils to see if it would correct it. This was a much less expensive option so we tried it and it worked! For awhile at least.  After this, we drove it for a long time as a commuter vehicle and put over 50K more miles on it, but the problem was reoccurring. We changed the spark plug & coil on whichever cylinder was causing the problem and would get a few thousand more miles on it. Then... around 100K miles, the clutch went. That’s actually normal but it was expensive because of the brand. A couple thousand dollars for that. Then, several areas on the engine started leaking oil and it started overheating and it was the thermostat leaking... repair estimate? Nearly $5000 and that wasn’t even the dealers price! A recommended Mini & BMW mechanic. The car isn’t worth much more than that with this number of miles. This is when I gave up and cut my losses. Once it gets up in miles it starts falling apart and it’s not worth the cost of repair.  Aside from that, it is fun to drive.. although for me, it lacked power on initial acceleration. It handled well and the steering was great. Interior has more room than expected being a Mini, the Clubman extra length gives the back seat decent room for two people. Other than that the interior design is not good at all. The window up/down buttons are right by the cup holders so you can’t use them if there is something in the cup holder without moving the cup. It’s minor but it’s annoying if you use the car all the time like I did. Also when one window is going down, if you then hit the other window switch to go down also, it will reverse the first windows direction. Again, not a big deal but annoying. The leather interior was nice looking and it held up well with daily use. Gas mileage was great with the manual transmission. I don’t recommend this as a good used car option though. It becomes a money pit at higher mileage.

I get so many comments...someone asked me if it was a MINI Limo.  I have taken many road trips of up to 800 miles at a time.  The seats could be a little softer, but they are not bad.  They hold you in place.  I get better gas mileage than posted...29 in town and up to 38 highway...depending on how heavy my foot gets.  It's definitely an attention getter car.  My battery had to be replace in less than 2 years...but fortunately still under warranty.  Options are expensive as are the run flat tires.  I am looking forward to buying the Countryman in a couple of years.  Love the barn doors."

mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Janice, 10/13/2009,Don't Buy the Hype,3,"At the risk of revealing that the emporer has, well, not all his clothes, I'll say that my new Mini, an automatic, has scary hesitation when you floor it from zero.  The automatic tire pressure sensor gives false alarms, so the local dealer wants me to pay to fill the tires with nitrogen.  Don't put barefoot kids or anything delicate in the backseat floor because the runners that slide the seats are incredibly sharp, exposed metal. They punctured a 2L soda bottle recently. It got under the carpet, and the dealer wanted $900 to dry it out, claiming no fault because cargo belongs in the cargo area (duh? but sharp metal is ok for people?) My auto body guy did it for $300. Keep shopping!"
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Gerry Maldo, 04/14/2010,2009 Mini Cooper Clubman Base Automatic,4,This vehicle is incredible fun to drive. I am averaging 26 mpg mostly city and not much traffic (really bad for a small vehicle) If you like manual transmission stick to it as on this car as the base model (NOT S TURBO) does not have the perk to get you moving. The car is a great eye catcher on the road. If I decide to get into another Mini it will the Turbo (S)model for sure. Cornering is a thrill like any other car on the road.  
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,unhappyminiown, 10/17/2012,maintanence nighrmare,3,"The car is great to drive nad provides a lot of interior space. The sales process was easy but the car was not thoroughly reviewed regarding the complicated alert system for maintanence. The dealership uses the car system to tell the owner that maintance is needed. There is no 5000 mile oil change schedule. The problem is that a yellow light comes on for one second at start and the owner has to go through a complicated push button hold 2 seconds, scroll to another screen, hold again ....... The engines probably love this feature but it is complicated. A big yellow light tells you that the temperature is 32 but you never get a similar warning for important things such as oil level low."

It's a absolute blast to drive. I love that it's factory tuned to backfire... There's nothing like hearing a pop and having flames shoot out of the tailpipe while shifting! This car has a great exhaust note and lots of low end grunt for a low displacement engine. Not only is it fast, fun, and efficient, but it's also quite practical.
It's a small car, don't get me wrong, but It's surprisingly spacious inside.

She did an Edmund's comparison online and was intrigued, so we headed out to the dealer where she fell in love with the S model.  We diligently  made our choices online and ordered her baby.

mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Disappointed, 03/31/2010,Shoulda bought the Honda,3,"We bought a 2009 Clubman because it was fun to drive, different, and got good gas mileage.   We put the car on the road for a 2500- mile summer road trip; performance was great and mileage was *fantastic* (~41MPG on the highway), but we found that the passenger-side carpets were wet.  We had to diagnose the problem via the MINI discussion boards on the internet, and traced it to a poorly installed gasket in the A/C system.   Other problems included rear-door seals that didn't seal, an inaccurate speedometer, and shut-downs due to bad throttle assemblies.   After ~5 repair trips in 12,000 miles, the dealer replaced the car, so we now own a 2010 - with a gas gauge that doesn't really work."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,SCBlueDevil, 01/09/2009,I never thought I'd drive a MINI,5,"After driving an Infiniti FX-45 for 4 years, when gas hit $4 I got tired of 13 MPG. I wanted something sporty, unique, and borderline practical. A regular Mini was too small, but the Clubman was love at first sight. I'm 6'4"" and it's as comfortable as most full sized cars. It is a blast to drive, a definite show stopper in parking lots, and is averaging 26/35 MPG. I  just wish someone had warned me that Minis are like Harleys - the initial purchase is just the start, then you become obsessed with everything Mini!  Oh well, everybody needs a few vices in life."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,dima, 04/02/2009,Clearly not a Toyota,4,"Minis are viewed as city cars, however except for the looks, it's a poor city runabout: just try opening those huge heavy doors in a tight parking space!  Steering is heavy. Pedals are heavy. Handbrake is heavy. Gearstick is tight. Worst, the engine is so coarse - my wife initially thought it was a diesel! And too slow for Boston traffic flow. Moving it through stop-start traffic is a pain. Turning circle feels surprisingly large too.  However it all changes once you get above 30mph. It's an absolute joy on the highway, and through the turns it feels like it can take any curve at any speed.  At 2,000 miles, been to the repair shop 3 times already. The dealer's very nice though."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Mahvelous, 01/20/2009,Perfect City Car,4,"So far so good. After 4500 miles no issues and the car has surpassed expectations. This really is the perfect city car.  Easy to park, good on gas, fun to drive, and can be made to accommodate your stuff or your friends.  So far very pleased with purchase.  Only shortfall is the brake feel.  The JCW is more performance oriented version but the brake feel is too touchy for spirited driving.  The brakes feel like they grab too much even with slight pedal pressure. Easy to upset balance of car.  Stopping power is excellent with the 4 piston front brakes made by Brembo. Good car. Take the plunge you fence sitters."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,antennariidae, 04/21/2009,How much is fun worth to you?,4,"After looking at this car, the Jetta Sportwagen and the Mazda 3, I ended up getting the MINI.  I got only the Premium package and the cold weather package.  Added 16"" wheels (15""=""clown car"") when the dealer gave me a deal on a set they had in the warehouse.  In short, the car is fun to drive.  Handling and braking are outstanding and the base model has enough power for most situations.  Once you commit yourself to revving it higher and downshifting when required, the power is adequate.  It's been reliable through the first 4,000 miles and have averaged 32mpg in traffic.  Other cars are more practical but MINI is selling fun as much as they are selling cars and in this area it delivers. "
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,John, 04/23/2009,Even with 2 kids,4,"The Clubman has given us a practical reasons to have a fun car.  My wife has been wanting a MINI for years.  With two kids, that wasn't happening...until the Clubman came.  We have a 4 year old and a 5 month old.  Car seats and entry and exit are no problem on the passenger side, thanks to the third door.  Behind the driver's seat is a little tight, but basically a non-issue.  After driving it for the last few months, I kind of wish we got the S.  But the straight 4 cyl does well in almost all our driving conditions, except when I want to really push it up a hill from a stop.  "
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Runner57, 06/19/2009,Base model is the best performing MC,5,"What are you waiting for? If you want to have fun and most of the standard features plus unbeleivable fuel economy (400 - 500 miles per tank ~ 13 gallons) this is the car to get. I call this is a hybrid (fun & fuel economy). I got the basic model - yet it has pleasing features all around. It has leatherette seat, more than necessary electronic controls, cool audio (the base stereo is better than my other three cars), quiet engine, engaging transmission, and lots of complements from every one. The car gets impressive miles in the summer (37 in the city & 42+ in the highway) with aggressive driving. This car invites you with electronics, also turns on necessary lights in the dark as you exit."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,DavidBerndt, 06/29/2009,MY THIRD MINI,4,"My lease was up on my 2006 JCW Royal Gray Cooper S with 38,000 miles. I was a little apprehensive about the change from a supercharged 210 HP to turbo charged 178 HP engine but not believe there is not much difference other than saving $7K for the JCW upgrade. The new 2009 Clubman S arrived 8 weeks after ordering and it much better than I expected."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Tim, 07/21/2009,I'm Happy,5,"I traded in an F150 Pickup so this was a big change for me. No regrets. With the rear seats down, I can get 2 guitars and a bunch of other stuff in it so what's not to like there? Real adults can ride in the back. Wouldn't recommend that across country but around town, not too bad. I wish I could get the high 30's MPG that others are reporting, however, 30.8 average for 8K of all kinds of driving is not bad.

mini,cooper-clubman,2009,geezer, 07/30/2009,You Will Love It!,4,"Fantastic car, runs best on premium gas though, this is a fun hi- performance car for reasonable money , has a 3 year full maintenance package included, and the final and 4th year warranty covers all the major components.... look this car is fun, fun, fun! Great around town, sharp and powerful on the highway sips gas, feels very well built, has a 5 star crash rating, club door works well, reasonable rear seat room for adults, no really!! Looks sharp, has all the latest technology, good brakes, good visibility, nice feel to the controls. I highly recommend this stretched MINI cooper s clubman."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,GoClyde, 08/07/2009,Change is Good,4,"When fuel was at $4 plus and I was driving a big GMC Denali something felt wrong.  I began looking for a fuel efficient car that was fun to drive but also provided the utilitarian features of my truck.  I found it in the Mini Clubman.  Outfitted with a roof rack system from Mini this car has taken all I can dish out.  Mountain biking, road biking, camping and hauling hockey equipment back and forth to the ice rink has not slowed down this car. In the sport mode the umph is exciting and shifting the gears is fun.  On long trips with three people the car is still enjoyable.  A fourth makes it seem a bit cramped.  At 6'2"" I'm quite comfortable driving this car that makes heads turn."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Mini Me, 08/17/2009,New To Mini's,5,"I love this Mini, I got it in Hot Choc color, and lounge leather lounge leather interior,with cream accents. So far I don't have any complaints, and don't expect I will either. The barn doors make loading a breeze. I have liked mini's for a while but they were just not practical until now, I love the extra space, and once the seats are folded down its surprising how much you can get in there!!  The ride is alot smoother than the regular cooper. Does not quite corner as a regular cooper, but I'm not a race car driver either."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Ashley, 08/16/2009,Quirkey type of fun,4,"I bought this car when gas was pushing $4.50 and quickly learned to forget about the gas crisis. I generally get 430 miles to a 13 gallon tank before I start looking to fill up. In slower traffic, stop and go, it can get a bit punchy. That being said, it is the most fun I have had driving a car. I haven't had any real problems with the size of the car, it fits anywhere and with the clubman's back doors, everything fits. The clubman S has a lot of power and when I'm not paying attention it surprises me still. I get quite a bit of attention in parking lots as people always are scrunching their eyebrows coming over to look at it. Learn to keep it clean b/c of all peeks in the windows."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Andy, 08/23/2009,A lot of fun and great drive,4,"This is the second Mini I currently own. My wife took the first (a 2007 cooper base) after falling in love with it. We took the Clubman on a 2500 mile vacation trip (a bit hesitantly since there aren`t that many dealerships cross country) after purchase and it performed flawlessly.  Loved driving every mile! The service at the dealership is awesome and their customer service is one reason why I purchased another mini.  I gotta admit, I do like the clubman better than the mini...feels more stable. And the turbo is exceptional.  When the Mini 4 wheel drive debuts in 2010, we`re gonna look at that.  Overall, the mini is a great riding, handling vehicle. Love the shifting with the 6 speed."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,dodo, 08/13/2009,AMAZING!!!,5,I love my mini clubman!!! When I went to the dealer to buy the cooper I quickly realized the space in that car was going to become an issue in the future. I opted for the clubman for that reason and boy am I glad I did! It still is really fun to drive and the extra space is really a bonus!!  
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Love this car, 09/08/2009,Better than I ever expected,5,"People told me that it would be fun to drive but it exceeds all expectations. I love getting in the car every single day - driving has never been so much fun.  Great handling, fast and gas mileage!  I get (average between city & highway) 41 MPG (the online computer says I get 43 but I do the math and it's comes out to 41.2).  We regularly use this as the family car because my kids love to ride in it - fit 4 people and 15 bags of groceries just fine."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,ny mini, 10/18/2009,it's not a car - it's a MINI,4,"We bought our Mini Clubman S new about 6 months ago. My other choice was a new V6 Accord, but decided on the Mini just because I wanted a change and better handling. Overall, I love it. It's surprisingly roomy inside for a small car, We have a 4 yr old boy and it's perfect - thats why we opted for the clubman. The Mini has more noises than I can identify, but that becomes one of it's charm. The clubman is not a ""pretty""car, but I think thats what I like about it. Only regrets are the ""pleather"" seats; they are too hot in the summer. The stereo is not that good either, but I find I am less interested in what I am listening to and more interested in the drive. Definitely Fun and different!"
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,JR, 12/16/2009,"Still new, but what fun we're having.",4,"""Pepper"" is still new at about 5K so can't comment on what I consider the most important factor - reliability.  So far so good, though.  My wife talked me into buying the Clubman.  I thought it was too expensive for what you get.  And the options are too expensive and too numerous.  However, the little beast has totally grown on me and made me a MINI convert.  The S is fast enough for most enthusiasts and it handles like MINI says: Like a go-cart.  It's small to be sure, but when you're inside it feels much bigger.  Never thought I would say this, but I love this expensive toy car."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Matt, 12/29/2009,Big Little Car,4,"Fun Little car that fits my 6' 2"" football player sized frame.  Better leg room than a many bigger cars, with full winter gear on can be a little tight width wise.  Handles great and with standard engine can easily do 80 and keep up or pass everyone.  Gas prices are a non issue and can fit 3 people without much of an issue.  Do however hate the low hight when I have big SUV's and their lights trying to intimidate me, but just run away from them with superior handling."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,gopar1, 02/28/2010,Much better than advertised,5,Don't believe the literature about how fun it is to drive this car - it is 10 times better than they say!!  My Clubman S can get up and go without any problems.  The ride is sporty and the quality is great.  The gas mileage is fine - getting about 29 to 30 mpg's combined.  If I could just go the speed limit I think the mileage would go up - however hard to do in this car.  I will trade economy for fun any day.  This is our first Mini and I will certainly buy another!
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Gregg, 04/02/2010,Fun and then some,4,"I have had the car for seven months and the only thing I can say fun fun fun. Great handling, the response is unbelievable. How so much car can be built into such a compact design is anybodys guess. There is nothing on the road that looks like it and it turns heads when you drive. Will be getting another one as soon as the lease to our second car is up. Definitely look at this one if your in the market."
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Buffaloe, 07/31/2010,The Jury is Out,4,"While I am very pleased to date with my Clubby, the potential for issues associated with build quality, durability, maintenance intervals, etc make me wonder about the future. Given the Clubby is under warranty but when I learn that brake replacement can approach $1K or higher, that concerns me. IMO, the whole MINI culture/concept not only includes the original purchase price but also the ongoing highly expensive maintenance. I will watch these reviews closely as the 2008 Clubby lose warranty coverage. "
mini,cooper-clubman,2009,Brad, 05/07/2019,Car from the heavens,5,"People review this car very negatively and yes cars can have problems but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get one everyone told me how expensive bmw parts are and how bad the transmissions are but i’ve had nothing but a trouble free experience I bought a 2009 automatic mini clubman (non s) i’m not going to lie i like to drive fast and it’s true driving a slower car fast is so fun and it has such a sporty feeling especially with sport mode on but you don’t have to only listen to the bad reviews some of these minis are amazing

mini,cooper-clubman,2010,Hight, 09/18/2016,2010 clubman base,4,"Owned this car for over two years. Have had some repairs but once you figure out you can buy these parts yourself and repair them... you will reduce your headaches!  Oil changes and brakes can be done yourself for minimal cost.    Excellent gas mikage. Typically on freeway 40+ mph.  You will find each mini has its own gremlins.  Mine will ONLY take certain types of gas or she gets very upset! They all have their quirky personalities but overall a joy to drive. Mine makes regular Costco trips  packs 6 foot football players and gear and my 6 ft husband loves to drive it and has plenty of headroom. Overall very happy with mine.

mini,cooper-clubman,2010,Donkey Boy, 08/12/2016,"Fun, Great Mileage, Beware of Repair Costs",4,"We bought a 2010 Clubman new. It was blast to drive and everything went well until the warranty expired. Car developed a couple of coolant leaks and $4,000 and two days later we were back on the road. The Clubman is actually comfortable for four and we have taken several roadtrips without complaints. With the manual ( very nice 6 spd) we can get as high as 39 miles to the gallon. We ordered the upgraded stereo and it is worth it. Bottom line is that the car is very fun, and cute. I would recommend buying the extended maintenance plan - it is a bitter pill but can save you lots of money down the road. A Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla will be more reliable but styling is terrible - absolutely neutral.

If a BMW 328i and a Honda Fit had a child this would be it. I am 6'5"" 230 lbs. and this car has more interior space than my BMW. My Clubman is great for mountain biking, kayaking, surfing and has room for my home depot trips. I would highly recommend this car. Love My Mini! "

I have owned a lot of cars. This one is a Gem. It is well built (BMW), Fast, really fast.
It handles really well. The Brembo Brakes on the JCW are really good. Stops the car instantly, helps with great handling through the curves.
Nothing has gone wrong on the car yet, just regular maintenance.
It handles like a sports car so the ride may be stiff for some people.
Bottom line: I don't want to get out of it.
It is far too much fun to drive.
The base stereo is not bad either!"

Additionally, I had to purchase new tires within two months of buying the car only 25k on it, and had to fix the driver's side and sunroof's window seals. I did not expect nor anticipate the cost to repair all of the issues, (around $4000). By the time it hit 42K, I had to fix all of these things. I am so over it, and most of these things should not have gone out! Very disappointed in Mini at the exuberant amounts they charge for parts and labor. Not a reliable vehicle at all! :-( "

I was told BMW's have plastic parts as well.  I go to wash the car and find a crack in the windshield that started on the top edge??  Dealer wants $800+ to replace.

Anything and everything that can go wrong with this car has gone wrong.  Electronic shifter, rear door release went out after a car wash, thermostat, water pump, water pump discharge pipe, drive belt, seat belt module, hood latches, timing chain tensioner, valve cover gasket, vacuum seal.  The crazy thing is you can find videos or instructions on how to fix all of these items yourself.  That's because so many people have these problems and don't want to pay the ridiculous Mini Cooper repair costs.  BMW engineer combined with British craftsmanship equals a car that breaks down a lot and costs an arm and a leg to repair.

mini,cooper-clubman,2010,beemerhead, 06/05/2010,Fun and Practical,5,"I have owned 2 Mini's in the past so I knew what I was getting into when I shopped for a Clubman S. Space is wonderful for a Mini. Be real. No one cross shops a Suburban and Mini.  I have taken two road trips in my Mini and I love every moment in it. It had way more than enough power in the Col. mts, yet good fuel economy (36 hwy, 26 city). I had 2 adults with about 4 duffel bags, all of which stowed nicely in the rear. The car is quick, amazingly fun to drive, looks cool and is  comfortable. Negatives are small cup holders , but way better than the past. Controls are switches like a plane but I like that. If you're attracted to a Mini. Just go get one and let the fun begin! Join a club, too!"
mini,cooper-clubman,2010,Jerry Casper, 03/21/2010,New Mini,4,This is my first Mini and I have really enjoyed it so far.  The Clubman version offers just the right amount of extra space for me.  I am an avid bowler and can easily fit two two-ball bags in the back without lowering the seats.  The extra space in the rear seating area is perfect for the grand kids and occasional adult.  In general the interior is comfortable but there are few quirks.  I don't like the placement of the power window controls which are right in back of the cup holders.  With cups in the holders you can't reach the controls.  All in all a great little car with good pep and super economy: Averaging 28+ mpg in city driving.

The rear, with seats down, is larger the many bigger cars trunks. There are 2 levels of storage under the floor in the rear. The barn doors are easy to use and better then a swing up door in tight places. Parking is a breeze. I now have about 4  more feet of usable space in my garage. The back seats lack leg room but are very comfortable with the front seats moved a bit forward. The roof rack system will carry just about anything I can think of and is much easier to reach then a SUV. This is a well thought out vehicle with lots to offer regardless of its size or any size. "

First the Love: Yes, it is a blast to drive (and park ), it has the best seat heaters on the planet, and the milage/fun can't be beat !

Now for the Hate: Some of the controls are just plain maddening, the rearview mirror and the barn doors create the worst blind spots ever. 

Overall I love the car, a year later and I still smile every time I get behind the wheel, but I wish Mini would not be quite so quirky with those controlls, it's just maddening.

Fun car to drive, and still get 30 MPG ave, sure you could get more driving a Prius, but if you want to drive a car with personality ..."

So far so good. It is surprisingly fast and as expected good on gas. The moonroof is great but I miss being able to avoid the sun completely. It corners real well. It takes a while before the GIANT speedometer grows on you. But, you will get over it. It is basically a 4 cyl BMW 3 series. If reliability is not an issue over the years, then it is a great car by all means. The HK audio has too much base. It is tight inside but cozy and snug. "

For us it was a grocery getter but the grocery store was 15 miles up and down country two lanes, ideal driving for this car. If you are in town, get an automatic and turbo, non turbo with auto is under-powered. If you're young and limber it is fine for road trips, if you a bit beyond middle age get something a bit bigger and easier to get in and out of."

Unfortunately the engineering and reliability is reminiscent of the original Mini: timing chain, water pump, burns oil (1Q every 3,000 miles), clutch (replace after 50,000), water/oil seals, tires (replace after 20,000 miles), stereo (complete failure after 2 years), brakes, shock absorbers (replace after 50,000), spark plugs, fuel injection system.

The fuel pump broke driving off the lot, the airbag system has been repaired 3 separate times, the water pump failed, an oil pump solenoid leaked and has been replaced twice, and the rear cargo 12v outlet came apart.
The runflat front tires needed replacement at 12,000 miles (told by dealer this is ""normal"", which of course is silly), and now there is a recall on the electric coolant pump for the turbo (can cause engine fire).

We looked at competing small cars, but they simply did not come close to looking, driving or performing like the Mini. The base-engined Clubman with the 6-speed is more than adequate for civil driving and has enough punch when we want to get ""sporty."" The power is tractable and predictable. High-speed driving is effortless, as the engine creates good mid-range torque. Wind does not affect handling or power.  Interior comfort is very good, too. The car draws good comments and everyone that rides in it finds that it is more than it appears, as in power, comfort, features, quality, etc."

Our MINI Clubman,(leased), automatic trannie, AC, cruise, & bluetooth gets 41.6 MPG at a steady 72- 75 MPH, The 3rd door is convenient and allows either passenger or pet easy access to the rear seat.

So it sat a lot during the winter which was quite mild. We found about 2 inches of water in the passenger side floor. I evacuated all the water and dried it out. My wife had left the door ajar so I assumed this was the problem. It happened again a few days later. Turns out the sunroof drain came off during the winter while the car was sitting and the water leaked down the front pillar into the electrical junction box and into the passenger compartment. HI BMW a third grader could have figured this out. Audi had already lost millions in a class action for the same thing. 
So my junction box is all corroded and it's $2300 to fix it. 9 percent of the original sticker to replace a fuse box that some idiot approved as okay to place it under a roof drain that doesn't even have a clamp to hold it on. GENIUS! FYI the drivers side is set up the same way. I also noticed that the screw covers had all been removed prior so the problem obviously had happened before. 
The dealer offered me 5k for my 11k car so I'm fixing it and trading it. No longer a fan.

UPDATE. So I fixed the car and after requesting the repaired parts and  South Shore Mini gave me a bunch of parts that didn't go to the car, I threatened to sue and they dropped the repair to $1400, still high for a 400 part and two wire connections that it turned out was all they replaced. I called Mini Regional and they never called back. Turns out customers are below them. They have a company policy of not calling CUSTOMERS back. "" We handle these internally"" was the response. Mini also does not have any set pricing guides for repairs like most manufacturers have so the dealer can charge you whatever they want. 

FYI I traded in the repaired Mini for a Volvo C30. Wow what a great car. Faster, quieter, more power and about the same size. Better gas mileage on the highway about the same around town. After adding in the repair cost in I still got $4000 more than the Mini dealership offered.  So look around before you buy a Mini. They may look cool but there are a lot of other options out there

After 20+ years of station wagons and minivans, my wife is in love with her new baby, and I have to admit I'm jealous.  We got the manual trans, which shifts like butter. This car is super fun to drive, takes off like a rocket, and is a real head-turner. I highly recommend the experience."

mini,cooper-clubman,2011,russmike, 05/21/2011,Excels at many things,4,"I've owned the car for a week now - ~350 miles. Achieved 29.5 mpg on the first tank, in mixed city/highway driving (a good bit of idling in traffic), and the current tank is at 36 mpg for highway and some errands. Great power, even though I'm still breaking it in, and the steering is immediate. Good steering feel, too, the car magazines are wrong on that count. Great stereo (Harmon Kardon/Sirius XM), and very comfortable driving position (I'm 6'1"", 230lbs.). I'm going to keep my Lexus LS, but probably drive this a whole lot more."

mini,cooper-clubman,2011,Coop a Loop, 10/24/2017,Mini with Major Problems,1,"What a POS, always said before do not buy a BMW, Audi, VW etc because repair costs are so high. This is perfect example. Had a 2011 with 90K miles, great looking car, fast, but scary fast at times, hit a bump at high rate of speed the car jumps into other lane almost. This one started to smoke once in a while and then Oil pressure light kept popping on & off and no one could say why for sure. So we tried this & that but light always came back. Also alternator went out so had to be towed, $1000 imported alternator, then water pump cracked as well at the same time. Dumped this car ASAP.... mechanic told me they are only good up to say 100K miles and then they start to go, I now believe him. Stay with a Japanese car, at least they last, and hold their value better that this BMW/Cooper did. Only had it for almost 4 full mos and spent well over 2K trying to keep it running, good thing they are so cheap to buy, now we know why.

The driving experience is fantastic.
We have the automatic and it has more that suitable power.
The
design is great and we always get positive comments.

The problem with the car is with the finish of the paint.
Our clear coat developed spots in it within 4 months of ownership.
Now the clear coat is disappearing in small areas of the car.
 MINIs warranty does not cover this defect.
I would expect the paint of a brand new car to last longer than a few months."

They are bricks that feel horrible.
I decided to pay the 2 grand for the best seats that they had in the JCW Clubman.
This was well worth the money.
The seats are much nicer and feel good even on long trips.
At club meetings with other Mini owners I cringe at riding with other s because their seats are so bad.
This car is fun and quick and has enough cargo room to function reasonably.
If you are going to trip with this car you will need to pre-arrange your luggage sizes.
There is a lot of room available in the back if you are industrious with your luggage choices."

The overall look is fantastic and the interior materials are very high end. That being said the rest of the car is a bit disappointing . The car has an auto and regular 1.6 L - this is a sluggish combo. The 17"" wheels look fantastic but after a few months of driving with the run-flats made we want to trade the car in. Switched to high performance regular tires and problem was solved. Overall the car is a ten in appearance and interior design. The performance is solid six. The 4spd auto just doesn't translate well with normally aspirated 1.6. I would advise buying the extended maintenance plan because the cost of repairs can be high if you are unaccustomed to german car repair costs.

After driving it awhile the check engine light went on. I had it checked out by a local mechanic who could not find anything wrong.  2 months later light went on again and now I've made an appt. with a Mini dealer. Evidently this is a common problem with Minis. Its now 2020 and the car is great . No further problems since the heat sensor replacement (covered by warranty). I wish they still made this size Mini.

mini,cooper-clubman,2016,Tom, 08/07/2016,Better than the critics say,5,"I have had this for 3 months. I got the base model with the sunroof and 6 speed manual. The car listed for $27,000 and I bought it for $21,500, including a $1000 rebate. I looked at other cars such as a Civic, Hyundai Elantra, and Kia Optima and they would not discount their cars nearly as much. For the price I paid the car is a great value. It is a premium car. Come standard with 2 zone climate control, blue tooth, sirius radio, alloy wheels, premium vinyl soft touch materials. I get and average of 38 mpg on a tank with 70% high way driving and 30% city driving. I took a 1700 mile trip and averaged 42 mpg for the trip. On the 1700 mile drive, the seats were very comfortable. Much more so than our Dodge Grand Caravan or the Chrysler 300 premium I recently rented. The bluetooth is very easy to setup and the call sound quality is much better than the VW CC I had prior. The only complaint is the knob control for the radio, bluetooth, etc. is not super intuitive and  takes a little to learn it. Once I learned it, it is great, but my wife, who rarely drives it, is struggling to learn it. The Chrysler 300's interface is outstanding. I am 6'4"" and 300+ pounds an the car is very comfortable, more so than the VW CC or the Chrysler 300. The car is pretty quiet on the road. I feel, for the $21,500 I paid for it, it is a premium small car, unique and a great value. I change cars every 18 months (just cause I want too) and this is already one of my favorites.

The Clubman is the answer to all of it! It's the most fun, stylish car I've ever owned! My daughter loves all the fun interior with the rotation of ambient lights. Even my 6'2 husband enjoys driving and riding in this car. The matinance and warranty they offer can't be beat. As for safety my insurance went down because it had a better safety fm rating than my Nissan Altima.  Over all I've so in love with my Mini!

mini,cooper-clubman,2016,Merissa Shelburne, 06/04/2018,Exceeds my expectations!,5,"I have never driven a Mini Cooper Clubman.  I was out in the market looking for a Fiat SUV AWD.  Found one at Carmax but Carmax don't negotiate on prices.  I think a got a way better car with the Mini Clubman than the Fiat. The interior materials are high quality, the ambient lights fascinates me and it is a two-toned color.  I really love it!  It is so comfortable,  turns really good and grips the road like a camaro. It even has the option to go green which is fuel efficient.  It runs like my daughter's Lexus Hybrid, when you are in traffic, the engines stops like it is not running like the hybrids.  You can turn it run like a sports car and you can have it fuel efficient. The trunk is spacious enough to put a lot of groceries and the door opens side by side which is so nice, nothing falling down your head.  I even like the side visors, which helps a lot when the sun is so bright on my side window. Overall, the 2016 Mini Cooper Clubman is the best car I ever had.
"
mini,cooper-clubman,2016,CarGuy, 04/04/2018,Liked It More than I thought I Would!,5,"So, I needed a multi-purpose practical car. Mini's get expensive super fast as you put on options. I waited till end of year clearance and got a discount. That is the way to go. What has surprised me is the little 3-cylinder engine. I got the smaller engine to save money and just the FWD. I was not going to get this car (I have had 5 other Mini's) but I kayak and paddle board and no other vehicles have side open doors any more! All are lift hatches. So, I like the Mini styling and got this one at a discount. The base 3-cylinder is great around town and will even squeak the wheels. Where you lack is the top end. With only 134hp your torque and power run out in about the first third of the acceleration curve. When you are on the highway you won't get a big burst of power to pass. It is great on the low end. The cargo room is super. I love how the back doors open automatically when you put your foot under the bumper and now I don't think I could live without it. I have hands full of gear for work, groceries or kayaking stuff and it comes in handy. I love the low roof for a low throw for the kayaks and boards. The ride is amazing, the best I've experienced in a Mini. Also the sound proofing has improved a lot over earlier models. I got JCW sport seats which I might pass on the next time. I liked the style but they are a bit less comfortable for most. All weather mats, roof rack and folding seats make it a super multi-task vehicle for my outdoor activities, taking friends places and daily errands. Mileage is terrific. I get at least the low 30's on highway and high 20's in the city. My teenage nephew drove it on a family trip with my kayaks and a car full of friends and they loved it, especially the tech. So, I expected a slow 134hp, 3100lb mediocre but practical car and I have come to really enjoy it. If you have the bucks the turbo 2.0l is probably a bit nicer and you can get AWD but don't sneer at the base model. It is a good value and will do the job around town and you save many thousands compared to the top end Clubmans. I am now at the end of the lease and I have had not had one single issue with the car, nothing broken, malfunctioning or recalled.

Two weeks after our purchase, the trim peeled off below the windows. It took 3 weeks to arrive from Europe. Trim peeled off again 2 months later, trim on backorder. Our second issue was an engine light at 10K miles. The thermostat was out, re-placed.
Third issue, at 14K miles, the car would not start. Had it towed to dealer. ""DME error?"" The car is still in the shop day 8. Said the ""main communication circuit board"" is bad, they think? Took 5 days to arrive from Europe. Still not sure if a new circuit board has fixed it, more to follow. Will hopefully get warranty extended. I love it when I have it."
mini,cooper-countryman,2011,miniweenie, 07/03/2011,Fustrated with my Mini,3,I've had my mini since February and even before I made my first payment in April the fuel pump went out. I had ran out of gas with a quarter tank left in the tank. Had to wait a month since the part was not avaiable and they had to get it from Europe. They finally got it fixed and the car was working great till I ran out of gas again! They replaced the fuel pump again and also the water pump. They say that they are working out the kinks on this new model but give me a break. Shouldn't they do that before they start selling to the consumers? Can't wait to get rid of it

Yes it is a little noisy on the highway, but town driving is one of the best times to have fun driving.  It is an all around great car to drive, and even is ok for long trips.  My issue is that both the alternator and fuel pump have needed replacing on my car. This is the first car I have owned that needed this.  These are very expensive, look out wallet!  What they also do not tell you is that the spark plugs need to be replaced periodically and will cause the car to literally not run if your dealer overlooks this.  I have never experienced this with other vehicles.  I do not mind that it needs premium fuel to operate, but I do mind the costs of repairs.  If you get this car, make sure you have also bought the extended warranty for the maintenance & tire repairs.  Very expensive option, if you do NOT get this.

mini,cooper-countryman,2011,slfisher70, 05/18/2015,Not Economical at ALL,1,"I drive ALOT. The car is fun to drive when there aren't any mechanical issues. Owned by BMW, but shows NONE of the standard quality elements seen in BMI engineering. Fun to drive, but EXPENSIVE and CONSTANT maintenance. Computer is quirky and will put the car goes into ""limp mode"". The Transmission is sealed and can only be maintained by the ""dealer"" which ask for leg and arm to service. Chronic alignment issues on the ""rear""? Camber is off. Have notified Mini Of North America of the flaw in the rear control arms. Even had the dealer perform the alignment only to tell me after $350 they were worn out. Computer updates that some how get ""missed"" during service but are found after warranty has expired.Continued issues with random warning lights. Low tire is always on and can't get it off not matter how diligent you are with tire pressure. No spare tire which is fun to find out when you have a FLAT. Run Flat Pirelli tires are not economical at all. $35K for a car no spare tire?? It is slippery in snow and ice with the ALL4. Better all wheel drive vehicles. They make this car almost impossible to service yourself. Better cars for the price UPDATE_ Mini North American is aware of the alignment issues. I have eaten through tires about every 3-5 months. I align and it stays that way for about month and it is back out. The last time I contacted Mini North American. Made them aware of the ""short"" rear control arms. They just glazed over it and said we'll make a note of it. The next time you are out look at the rear camber on a mini. TOE IN. Update again- 120,000 had one dealer tell me engine needed $4000 worth of work and another $1500. I change my oil and am very aware of maintenance. This is getting too much to handle but I can't pass this lemon on to another person. Just got notification of faulty high pressure fuel pump for cars under 10 yo old or 150,000 miles. Have had several young people look at the car- Oh I want one of those or I am thinking of getting one of those. ME- DON""T! They are constant maintenance with little support from manufacture.How can Honda make a car that will run for >300,000 miles with minimal maintenance and Mini you get to 30,000 and its ready for its first round of fix issues. Have replaced the main computer already memory due to a crack in the head light that ""back fed "". I am at the end of my ownership. Will be selling this vehicle in 2019. This has to be the worst car. I have chased a check engine light for year and half. Finally she died. The timing belts I guess are a known issue. It started making a strange noise a couple weeks before timing belt shattered and went through the engine. Known issue the mechanic did say a word when I mentioned the noise.

I swapped out the stock run flat tires with Michelin Pilot Sport A/S Plus tires as our prior Mini had run flat tires and the ride can be very harsh with run flats.
The Michelins make the ride much more comfortable and the ride is much quieter on the road.

We got the car loaded with almost every feature.

That is not the worse of it.
The front cup holders have some plastic spikes to keep cups in place and if you use a styrofoam cup it punctures it causing the liquid to spill out and drain into the shifter cables.
This in turn causes the shifter to get stuck.

The 6 speed Getrag transmission is the highlight of the car.
The gas mileage as advertised I have not been able to achieve partly because of the way I drive the car. Best achieved MPG was 25. Not bad, not great either.
Major complaint is that as good as the steering is, heaven forbid if you hit rut. Once that happens, the car skips and hops which is somewhat disconcerting.
Never have lost control, however, some Southern California roads will have an abundance of defects in the roadway which makes you lose confidence in the handling of the car."

It's really a 4-door Mini that has all wheel drive.
This isn't your father's SUV, and it isn't really suitable for ""off-road"" vaunts of a SUV.

What the Countryman is is a 4-door sports car - a rally car really - with all wheel drive.
And, the all wheel drive only kicks in when it is needed, it isn't full time 4 wheel drive and it cannot be manually controlled by the driver.

This car will likely not appeal to those looking for a classic SUV.

The Countryman S is roomy for four people; it's fast; really fast in curves; super in town because of its agility and size ( for maneuvering and parking).   I've had no reliability issues with either of my Minis that I have owned, but my Clubman got better gas mileage ( 28 city and 37 hwy).  The ride on both is rough, so not so good for passengers, especially in city streets in West Virginia where I live. However, this is a sports car and as such, the ride is to be expected.  The interior layout of controls is not good, but , has been corrected in 2014 and later models. Still, I like all Minis.  Still no problems, at 35000 miles. I will always like Minis.

mini,cooper-countryman,2012,doug martin, 11/30/2015,We loved this car. Bought another!,5,"Bought new in 2012 and ordered from Factory to our spec's.  From day one, my wife loved this car.  Now has 32,000 miles and she still loves it.  A couple of minor problems in 3 years were quickly taken care of by Mini under warranty.  Have used on long and short trips and around town driving, and found to be very comfortable overall.  Only complaint is ""jumpy"" when hitting bumps in roadway....might be due to hardness of ride in Run Flat Tires ?  We have owned in the past, BMW X-5, Porsche Cayenne, Lexus RX300 and have not found the Mini to be any more unreliable or costly to operate.  We will probably buy another All4 in 2-3 years.

mini,cooper-countryman,2012,collin_cooper, 08/29/2014,2012 Mini Countryman S ALL4,4,"I love the car---i bought used as the new price for Mini with options is outrageously high---so I waited and got a used one with everything I wanted for about half the original sticker price.

things to know about Mini--the ride is sporty not smooth...bumps hurt sometimes:) The layout is meant to be quirky and not conform the norms of North American standards---if you dont like that then dont buy a Mini

They are small cars---yes is a SUVesque vehicle but it is compact--our family of three does great in---but a trip to Costco means one back seat usaually needs to be folded down.

Buy it if you love Mini--the brand, the personna ,etc.. if you are iffy do not buy it :)"
mini,cooper-countryman,2012,arthur_b, 03/19/2014,It's a good car the hatch back is way better.,3,"I own a Countryman S All 4 Automatic, its a nice car ok to drive. I'm comfortable with the layout of everything on the interior, I like ride the interior noise isn't bad.
Adding 500 lbs to a vehicle it seems they would have upped the horse power a little bit.
One of my biggest problems is not with the car but BMW.
The free service cover brakes and wiper and oil changes.
Dont ask the have your tires rotated or road hazard on the expensive run flat tires.
So don't get a nail in your run flat because you canjust through that tire out and but a new one.
The charge for fuel injector cleaning $250, the charge for wheel alignment $200, for the tire $300. "
mini,cooper-countryman,2012,Kristen Schroeder, 04/05/2015,Nothing but problems,3,"I bought my 2012 Countryman because I loved my Cooper S but needed a little more space.  In just 24,000 miles I've had the radio replaced, the computer replaced, the gauges fixed, the water pump replaced, a coolant leak fixed, and a wheel bearing replaced.  Now the front wheel makes a spring noise every so often and it scrapes but then stops.  Mini says there's nothing wrong but will offer me a fraction of the purchase price to put me into a new POS Mini.  For now it's in storage because it's too delicate to actually drive."
mini,cooper-countryman,2012,so_cali, 07/01/2012,Could Have Been SO Much Better,3,I own a 2012 Mini Countryman S AT FWD. Apparently Edmunds doesn't think they make an auto trans as there is no option for choosing one as your model. This car looks SO cool and drives great except for the harshness of the runflat tires. No spare tire and no place for one. No back up camera. Cupholders placement and size are a joke and the whole rail system is silly and causes rattles. Get the three across back seat and avoid the rear rail at least. AC could be better. Navi and almost everything about the interior is pointless in that you need to take a class to learn how everything works and everything is placed where it shouldn't be. A whole lot of counter intuitive design. 
mini,cooper-countryman,2012,cmontyburns, 08/08/2019,Worst car ever,1,"Cheaply made, constant mechanical problems for five years. I mean Yugo-level problems (hood latch broke ($300), dashboard railing snapped off when key got stuck (fixed myself), ""car access module"" went bad ($800), drivers side door seized up ($500), shift linkage broke ($900), etc. etc.). The best way I can put it is that in my opinion, the designers of this car (and I believe the whole Mini line) put form over function in just about every way. I can't recommend highly enough against purchasing this vehicle. Simply junk.

mini,cooper-countryman,2012,barefooter0_1, 08/26/2012,Can't say I would buy another,2,"Having owned 2 other Mini's I expected high build quality, great power to weight ratio and above all stellar reliability. 
What I got is this: so-so performance, a valve train that sounds like a handfull of bolts in a coffee can, and a trip to the dealer 20 miles away in limp home mode.
Add in the shrinking/peeling chrome along the belt line and the end caps on same that keep falling off in parking lots, and a 3 day stay in the shop and you have my Mini Countryman.
I am attempting to have Mini USA replace the vehicle. It is not what I expected or paid for."
mini,cooper-countryman,2012,dipankarc, 07/03/2013,Fun to drive but interior so so,3,"Fun car to drive (not sure why one of the reviewers didn't like it so much) - I think the boost of the turbocharger on the Cooper S is great.
 I drive a six speed and find changing gears smooth specially between 1 and 2 which to me is the true test of a manual.
 I used to drive an Accord with a manual and it was a pain to shift (if you can find one these days).
 I find it a pleasant change from drive a boat of an average mid size car however the looks of a Ford Fusion is tempting.
 Interior not so great.
Bench seat is an option!!

mini,cooper-countryman,2012,b_chaud_rodz, 02/11/2015,Mini Cooper Owner's Nightmare,3,"I bought the 2012 Mini Cooper Countryman when it came out.  I had a Mini Cooper Coupe in 2008, excellent little car, but too small.
The first problem, my 2008 gave me 500 miles to a full tank, this one 380 miles.  I asked the dealer, he said to drive it for more than 10,000 so the engine can open up and this would change. Not.
The second problem, every bump on the road could be felt.  I bought more expensive tires, no improvement.
Third, it stalls when you initial a drive after a full stop. I use the ""Sports"" button, this works, but its stays revved, scary to stop.
Fourth, windows gets extremely foggy when heat is on.
I am returning this car, even if it kills my credit, not my pocket. "
mini,cooper-countryman,2012,mike360, 11/29/2011,Great car,5,"We bought the 2012 Countryman S with an automatic transmission. This car is really fun to drive - the most fun I've had driving since my 1965 MGB. I love the steering - it's tight and very responsive. Acceleration is fantastic, and the sport mode is awesome. The design of this car is really cool, and it's great having a car that doesn't look like the ""cookie cutter"" cars out there - they all look pretty much the same. We've only had it for about two months, and it's amazing how many people have asked about the car when we pull into a parking lot. Everyone thinks it's really a neat car. I'm 6'2"", and there's plenty of head room and leg room. "

mini,cooper-countryman,2013,Ralph Ciccarelli, 11/19/2015,Love Mini's but...,3,"I love Mini's. I have had 5, two currently. I traded a Clubman S to get this Countryman SALL4. I wanted a little more ground clearance for snow and taking kayaks to the rivers and lakes. I wanted to keep a low throw to the roof because I have to put one or two 45lb kayaks up there. The Countryman had virtually all the right characteristics with AWD, low roof, good clearance and four doors for guests. 

The car drives great and is very comfortable. I just got vinyl seats because of wet clothes from snow and kayaking. They are surprisingly comfortable and nearly perfect for me. Vision is great, driving is solid and sporty and close to regular Mini's. It has a bit more of a big-car feel at about 3300lb but that's not bad. 

Here is the significant negative. I just got it back from the shop this week with a new engine at 14200 miles. I have low mileage because I have three cars. one of which is a company-work car. I went in for an oil change and the rear main seal was leaking. They called it ""crank lock"" and I did not go over it in detail with the technician ,although I wanted to. I am fascinated by engineering. 

In any case the dealership was fantastic. They were courteous and kept me up to speed on the pace of the repairs. I asked if it was a common problem or manufacturer defect and they said it did not seem so. However, I see another review here by another guy who had an engine replaced at low mileage, too. I smell a recall in the future. 

So, here's the summary. Mini's are fun, sporty, urban-cool and urban-practical to the max. They drive well and do everything just as I would hope. However, they are hit or miss, with a lot of misses on reliability. Understand, I love Mini's. I am in a Mini Cooper club but I have to be straight on the reviews because I use these reviews extensively myself. 

Not one other thing has gone wrong but the engine is a big deal and I think they said they replaced the water pump at the same time. So, if you consider one of these my best advice is be sure they are under warranty  when you buy.

mini,cooper-countryman,2013,lizzy_2005, 04/02/2015,Fun car good in all weather,4,"Never slid in ice or snow, handles very good. It is a lot of fun to drive and I would probably have better fuel economy if it was not as much fun to drive. No issues getting up to speed, that's for sure! I had some issues with local dealer support and quality of technology craftsmanship. It took me 2 years to get an issue fixed that came from manufacturer it was a faulty AV jack that made it so you could not plug in an AV cable to listen to anything but the radio. The other 2 issues I had were an oil leak that was manufacturer defect and an AC power cable was freyed that both had to be fixed. Repair takes a while, the MINI service center didn't have anything on hand so each thing that had to be fixed or replaced had to be ordered. 
I drove this with baby seats in the back and strollers and diaper bags in the boot (trunk). Not a lot of storage space, but that was not something I was concerned about. I never had an issue fitting anything I needed to in the Countryman. 
My biggest annoyances are the windshield wiper settings and not being able to actually block the sun from the sunroofs more. Otherwise it's a fun car and handles really well in all weather.

mini,cooper-countryman,2013,sam, 02/20/2016,Gotta love MINI but hate MINI problems,3,"Always been a huge fan of MINI but I've literally had so many problems with this car. Something went wrong when they designed it and even MINI mechanic told me that BMW parts aren't great. It's an awesome car but so not reliable. So far...the wheel bearings went, clutch, fly wheel, fuel pump and spark plugs. My car has 43k miles and none of this really should be happening. Did I get a lemon? Not sure...MINI seems to blame quality of parts. Some things were recalled...just been frustrating. When a MINI mechanic tells you this is typical...you know something is up. I wish they were reliable.

mini,cooper-countryman,2013,dhtchk, 05/28/2014,Poor Clutch Design,3,"I've owned 7 manual cars over my lifetime.
My year old MC Countryman S 2013's clutch never felt quite right, especially on hills.
I learned this past week how wrong it is --and that MC knows this and does not have a fix.
I was stuck in a mile of stop and go traffic --ON A HILL.
By 1/3 of the way up, the clutch was burning and smoking and I had tremendous difficulty getting to the top safely.
Although the burn smell lingered for another week, the clutch performed fine after that --no smoking no slipping.

I finally took it into the dealer to check it out.
Bottom line: Countryman clutches smoke on hills; expect it to burn out; hopefully it'll do so within warranty period. YIKES."
mini,cooper-countryman,2013,minilover5982, 05/06/2015,Love my little mini!,4,I was looking for a car that would be perfect for my family if 3 but still work if we decide to have another child. My husband and I were both astonished  by the room in the backseat! He could sit back there no problem  and he's 6'3. I knew I wanted a suv but I wanTed something  not too bulky.  This fit the bill and then some.  The sound is good so I won need to replace anything  and I love how the keyless  entry is standard.  It's a joy to drive and my husband and I fight  over the drivers seat. Even my 7 year old thinks mommy has a cool car.  We don't drive to work so I doubt we will have much engine problems and it's keeps the gas cheap. Wasn't a fan  to find out it takes premium gas.
mini,cooper-countryman,2013,Fred DeWald, 11/08/2015,MINI gives the Maxi,5,"Don't expect super luxury or technology.....although both are OK. Expect a fun driving experience; expect people asking you about your car as it's a bit unique. Good overall interior room......seats 5 which is good for a small car. Fun to own and drive. 

Now after almost 4 years I have 57K miles on the car; still having fun with it. Great to drive, good gas mileage, responsive......overall a great experience.

Now I have 67K miles on the car......still performing up to expectations. No big issues, just normal maintenance. Still recommending the car to those who want a unique and fun experience.

I'm up to 92K miles......car runs great; still fun to drive. Continue to believe the car is a good one for people who want something different.

OK....hit the 100K milestone!  All is good. Had 1 issue with broken hood cable/locks....could not open good....no fun and dealer was not sympathetic. Otherwise still a fine auto....

mini,cooper-countryman,2013,samalita, 12/19/2013,"Not ""more fun in a MINI""",2,"Since the day I picked the car up at the dealer I had a problem.
The radio overheated and turned off on my drive home.
I've had it in the shop over four times, the radio replaced, and it still has the same problem.
Apparently all Mini's have this problem; it's not just mine.
They pulled other Coopers off the lot to perform the same test, and found the same result.
I was finally was turned over to the regional office to resolve my issue since the radio is ""operating as designed"".
After four months of dealing with them, I'm offered either a buy back, or a cash settlement to buy an after market radio which doesn't exist.
If you experience the same issues, take it in immediately.  The buy back value is based off of the mileage when you first had it in the shop for the repair.  
It's a cute car with some great features, yet it appears they just tried to put too much in a small space.

That said, if you like small nimble cars with some pep and a firm ride, this car is for you. Very pleased with the large amount of interior space; leg room and trunk space are more than enough. Of course the steering feel and handling are sublime; the acceleration in sport mode is excellent. Very similar feel to BMW xDrive.

mini,cooper-countryman,2014,Dan Lopes, 11/21/2015,My experience so far with my 2014 Countryman S,4,"I'd been wanting a mini since driving one when I was a teenager back I the 70's. I wanted something big enough to carry my drums around so the Countryman seemed like a good balance of performance and practicality. I've had sporty cars before but I've been very happy with the Countryman. That's not to say there isn't any room for improvement. The visibility out of the back isn't great and one of the first things I did I was add a backup camera. Love it... It should be standard equipment on all modern cars. I've put about 14,000 miles on it so far and hasn't been in the shop for anything. The ride is ok with the Countryman but hitting a pothole or rut in the road will rattle your teeth. I know any performance vehicles ride is similar and I'll probably not go with the run flat tires when the time comes to replace them. The instrumentation isn't intuitive and takes a while to figure out, but wasn't a deal breaker for me. It provides info on every part of the car and will let you know if something isn't shut,tire pressure low, gas getting low and how far you can go with the gas you have, it even will let you know when the car needs regular servicing. 
      I've had the mini now for about 2 years. The car has been my daily driver and has been dependable. The only problem that came up is the sensors on the wheels came on for the right front tire to inform me that the tire pressure was low. I'm still using the run flat tires that came with the car and the ride is still very rough when driving a bumpy road. Still have plenty of rubber left on tires but going to put on regular performance tires in a few more months.
Update
Still problem free. Only in the shop for scheduled maintenance. The rubber on the run flats still good so I'm putting off replacing those for a while longer. Car starts right up every time I push the ignition button and runs smoothly.
Update 5/18
It will be 4 years in August, that I first drove off the lot. Outside of regular scheduled maintenance the Mini Countryman has been problem free. The ride can be a little rough going over ruts and potholes, but that’s the trade off I guess to achieve the handling that you get with the mini. I’m at 49,000 miles now. It’s my daily driver, and still loving it.
Update 5/20
Getting close to 80,000 on the odometer now. Replaced tires..... started getting engine light warnings... had it checked out.... fuel injectors were clogged. Didn’t like the dealer quote to replace them so shopped around and found a local reputable auto shop that replaced them for much less. The mini continues to run strong and smooth

mini,cooper-countryman,2014,JimboTron, 08/31/2015,"Peppy and fun, but not sure about longevity.",3,"Leased a Countryman S after being sold on its sportiness and utility (over a sedan).  The turbo provides enough boost to pass and accelerate at traffic lights.  Takes corners very well.  Gas mileage is pretty decent as long as you don't speed too much.  Still small enough to make parking easy.   

I am concerned about its longevity.  My windshield is already pretty pitted up after having the car for a little over a year.  The windshield angle is steep, so it will catch and not deflect road pebbles.  Electric gremlins are already showing up - the door ajar warning light kept coming on while on the highway, even though all doors were shut tight.  Happened on a few occasions.  Some rattling starting to show up near the driver seat, can't tell if it's coming from the seat itself or somewhere else.  Sometimes the idling will dip drastically and takes a few moments for the ECU to regulate the idle.  Seats will cause butt and back aches on road trips.  Center speedometer looks cool at first but the novelty wears off quickly.  

I will likely not purchase this car after the lease is up.  It's a fun car to have as long as you have a warranty and you're not going to be doing long road trips.
"
mini,cooper-countryman,2014,DC Mom, 07/27/2015,Cute but clunky driver interface and terrible mpg,3,"I've had this car about a year, standard city driving, with some long highway trips occasionally.  Bought it because I wanted something good for city driving and parking, and carting around a couple kids, but also with a little style and oomph. The model I have is pretty loaded, with the GPS system, leather interior, fancy sound system etc.

After a year, pretty disappointed.  It super cute and fairly fun to drive, though a little stiff.  However the navigation system is so counterintuitive that I literally never use it- weird menus, no touch screen, takes forever to input addresses etc.  The sound system interface is similarly unwieldy, the sound is great, but it is much more complicated than it should be to save radio stations, seek channels, switch inputs etc.  All first world problems, admittedly, but it does diminish your enjoyment of the car when it feels designed by people who were trying to drive you crazy.  Similarly, it lacks basic conveniences for the price point, like a back up camera.  Even the fact that it doesn't have a simple clock on the dashboard (you have to toggle three buttons to see the time) is annoying.

The worst part of the car is the gas mileage.  With such a little car, you'd think it would be great. Manufacturer says it should be about 25 city, 32 highway.  Hah!  On the back of a tow truck, maybe.  I put only premium unleaded gas in (never had to do that with another car) and still only get about 17 mpg with normal city driving, maybe 23 on the highway. When I took it in to be checked, they said there was nothing they could do, and that they had had a number of people with similar complaints.  

Overall, though I like the style and fun, I would not recommend.  And will probably be trading mine in pretty soon.

*UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER.  Still not loving the car. Lots of small annoying glitches in the system that have needed fixing in the last few years- warning lights broken, weight sensor in passenger seat malfunctioned etc. Gas mileage continues to be bafflingly bad, have brought it in several times but the dealer says it’s normal/is uninterested in problem. (I average about 17/mpg with normal sedate city driving.). Would trade it in but also not great in resale value, so will ride it out until I can afford a new car.

mini,cooper-countryman,2014,Samanthad, 10/22/2015,One problem after another,2,"I was so excited to buy a mini for the first car i had ever purchased on my own, i was fortunate enough to be able to buy a brand new one! After only having the car for 6 months i started having problems starting with my tire pressure monitors. My left tire pressure monitor kept saying that it was low and flat but when i looked at the tire it was fine and the air compressor part said i had fine air pressure. Than my car started having transmission/engine problems at only 8,000 miles as well as my car redlining at 25 mph. My car is now dying when i make sharp left and right hand turns, as well as the car redlining at 25 and finally shifting to a higher gear after i have no choice but to floor it and have the rpms at 8 on the rpm screen on the car than once it finally shift the car knocks you forward with a loud and hard clunking noise. I have had it with this car! Mini and BMW customer relations have been a total pain to deal with saying it hasn't been serviced enough to help me with a problem. NO car should drive like this!! My car is still in the service department currently and the service techs have no idea what is causing the problems or how to fix it saying they feel what I'm talking about but not sure if its a mechanical problem or electronic issue... Its safe to say i will not be recommending this car to anyone not even my worst enemy! if i could give it 0 stars i would.

mini,cooper-countryman,2014,Rose V, 03/26/2017,Cuteness will fade when you go to the gas pump,2,"I purchased this 2014 MINI Countryman new as the design was unique and quite cute.   However, the stitching in the seats allows for chronic crumbs and dust to settle  which requires frequent vacuuming.  The car uses at least a mid-premium gas and does horribly with the gas mileage - not as stated.  The car is sluggish going up hills.  There is very little space in the front of the car to store things.  All that being said, I am in the process of trading the car in for something more economical on gas, more space to store and a better interior seat design.  In addition, the front tires needed replacement at 24,000 miles.  The dealer said they 'are high performance tires and wear quickly' .

mini,cooper-countryman,2015,LeftyBass, 04/15/2019,grin-inducing Mini Countryman!,4,"After much reading and shopping around, I recently got a clean used 2015 Countryman. If you know what you are getting into beforehand, the Countryman does not disappoint. PROs: Right-sized inside/outside dimensions, good interior room and great visibility for such a small SUV, great steering feel/handling/brakes, plus the intangible Mini cachet. CONs: only adequate power from base engine, some quirky controls that take a little time to figure out, some road noise from the run-flats (which I may change), and a ride that may be too firm for some. Still, a fun and easy little car to drive, enjoy, and own.

The sport suspension ride was so stiff on the stock run flat tires that I bought a set of regular tires for it within a week. Doing so improved the ride, but I owned the car for 45 days before I couldn't live with it any longer, and I traded the damn thing in on a MUCH better car, the MINI S Clubman ALL4, and I LOVE the car. Before you buy an overpriced Countryman, test drive a Mazda, or a Honda, or a Ford, or, or, or... Do NOT base your opinion of the rest of the MINI lineup on the Countryman. MINIs are a hoot to drive. Just not THIS MINI.

mini,cooper-countryman,2015,Ilookmarvlus, 03/30/2020,We're fans 3 times over...,4,"This is our first MINI and still the newest we own.  It's been a ton of fun and extremely trustworthy.  It has enough umf to be a great car in the mountains and twistys and more than enough car for 99% of life's needs.  We've hauled some furniture, even a snowblower in the back.  With the roof rack on one trip to Vegas with 3 of us the bellmen at the Bellagio unloaded 16 bags, backpacks, compression sacks and containers.  

It's also phenomenal in snow.  We have two sets of tires, one set of Blizzaks just for the snowy season mid October to mid April and we can drive though anything we've encountered.

Some of the things we didn't like were the run flat tires, some handling behaviours on uneven surfaces and the mileage.  We've beefed up the anti sway bar to a solid 23mm bar, strut brace and got rid of the run flats and the handling is much better.  We added a JB1 plugin tune and the performance and mileage improved.  We also do our own maintenance.

We enjoyed it so much we added a 2006 R50 and we recently added a 2011 R57 Cooper S Convertible.

Just packed it full of gear and put the Thule on the top and headed for the lake for the week...4 adults, gear and the full Thule at about 70mph and I averaged 26mpg.   I thought that was pretty good for a motor that hadn't even been broken in yet!?!  All 4 adults were comfortable and had no complaints on the 3.5 hour drive.   Harmon Kardon sounds insane good!  We have a little Audi with the BnO and this is not quite the same quality of sound...but damn near!  Bluetooth works well and phone calls are audible.

mini,cooper-countryman,2016,Perry, 12/28/2018,Speed between 45-60,4,"I am currently leasing a 2016 countryman. When I'm going between 45-60 and punch the accelerator to pass a car, the vehicle sputters and jerks, makes clinking noises, and then accelerates. All of this occurs within 1-2 seconds. This is not a delay you can experience with a turbo. Each time I've taken it in for annual maintenance I bring up the issue. They inform me it's due to the spark plugs and coil in a high altitude like Denver. They change them and the car is fine for 2-3 months then it begins again. I was interested in buying the car off the lease until I asked how much it would cost to replace the spark plugs and coil... +$900. No thank you! I pass thousands of cars a day on the road in Denver and I've never heard of spark plug issues for other cars in high altitude. Plus, there are mountains in Germany so I don't accept their response.  Anyone else have a similar problem?

"
mini,cooper-countryman,2016,W3 Car Enthusiast, 06/07/2020,Love the Mini style with real practicality,5,"This is the ""family"" Mini if you want Mini style and attitude but you have a family and groceries to haul. 

The backseats can fit 2 real adults comfortably and still fit your bags or groceries in the trunk. 

The S version has enough spunk to get up and go even though it won't break any speed records but that's not what it's for. The handling is sharp like a Mini should be but can be a bit on the firm side. 

Like all Minis, you can customize it to your heart's content to make it your own. I love it and I'm thinking about getting a 2 door for everyday driving now just to add some fun to my daily commute.

UPDATE: Still loving the Countryman. It's small enough for city driving and ease of parking is great for those tight strip mall parking spots. However, the car is surprisingly spacious inside for passengers, even taller ones fit well in the back. Grocery hauling is not a problem with the trunk, but if you are shopping for a big holiday get-together, you might run out of space for all the stuff unless you fold down the rear seats. Ride can be harsh over some city streets that aren't kept up well though, but that's because the S has harder suspension for cornering. The gas mileage does suffer if you push hard on the freeway. It is after all, still a high revving supercharged engine pushing a car that is not exactly the most aerodynamically shaped.

mini,cooper-coupe,2012,Glenn A., 02/24/2016,Fun to drive,4,"This is a very small car that is fun to drive. I've had my 2012 since late 2011. The Laguna Green color I have was not in production for long so having a rare color is kind of fun. The MINI Connected system works pretty well even without an iPhone you get a fair amount of functionality and the center screen is very nice. The Bluetooth audio streaming works well with my the phones I've tried it with. The USB input also works well if you put mp3s onto a memory stick. My car has the HK sound system which sounds very good.

What I've loved best about this car is parking it in the city. I've squeezed it into some really tiny spots on the street. The handling is great as well and the steering feel is strong. Even the base Cooper Coupe has plenty of power for a normal driver. I've never had any issue with respect to accelerating when necessary. 

The boot is fairly large for a MINI and there are some interesting little storage areas as well.  

The ride can be a little harsh on rough roads given the small wheelbase, but on good roads the ride quality is quite nice. The sport seats are very comfortable and supportive.

mini,cooper-coupe,2014,CarGuy, 04/04/2018,Will be collectible,5,"This is a fantastic fun car. You can enjoy it in the city, on the open road and on the track. The car is small, quick and most importantly to me, unique. I get people talking to me all the time about it. They think it is a hard top convertible. The good points first: It is uniquely styled, quick at 208hp and fun to drive anywhere. The space is absolutely brilliant. The Coupe is the same body as the 4-seat standard Mini but the back seats are gone and the roof is chopped. What you get is a trunk as big as a small SUV. I know, I have two SUV's. This is great for extended road trips and there is a hatch you can  reach through to the trunk. I have put a cooler there at times, lol. On the track the car is amazing, especially for FWD and short wheelbase. It can get jumpy on hard breaking into a turn but you can roar out. Just keep it straight and steady. On autocross it totally sucks. There is too much pedal lag and I have the automatic. Autocross is hard off and on acceleration and breaking. You need the stick and will probably be all right. Also, the suspension is firm. Because I know Mini's I got standard suspension. You don't need sport. I do track with standard and it's fine. Sport will break your teeth. The minuses are the automatic pedal lag and very limited vision. I expect that in a chop top coupe but you may not. Small convertibles and hard tops like this always have limited vision. It is big fun in a small car. I believe this car will be one of the most collectible Mini's as they ran it only three years in the hard top. I also put winter tires on it (Pirelli Sotozeroes) and it does great in the snow. Perhaps the most cheerful fun car I've owned and I have had a bunch.
"
mini,cooper-coupe,2014,Ralph Ciccarelli, 10/30/2015,Eye Catcher,4,"I got my JCW Coupe for track work. So far I have done only one autocross and no track days. I got the automatic because I wanted the paddle shifters for great up and downshifts. It takes some practice but the shifts are amazing. Let me do the negatives first. First, with the automatic there is a bad peddle lag. Even if you put it in sport mode it is an automatic. It was terrible at autocross. With more practice, I could handle it but for autocross the manual is the way to go. I think the peddle settings are no different than a standard Mini. Also, the JCW does not come with a sport suspension standard even if you thought you were buying the ""M"" or ""AMG"" of Mini's. You need to add that and it can cost a good bit. So, it is not 100% sport. 

The rest is all great. Acceleration once you start is excellent, handling is excellent and the standard suspension is great for comfort if you want a daily driver. If you put a sport suspension and oversized wheels it is very very hard. You can buy the JCW suspension for $4k more and it might be the best all purpose suspension. Vision is limited but frankly I expect that is a sportscar or convertible. The styling is so unique many people will point and ask you about it. It is perhaps my favorite thing about the car. It looks aggressive, yet friendly. The trunk is to die for in a two-seater. The reason is that the back seats of a regular Mini have been removed and even though the roof is lowered you have a ton of trunk for a little car. It has a reach through that is handy for longer stuff or reaching back to say a small cooler. It is a great road trip car and can handle decent luggage for two people. The car will fly and corner well and to me your big decisions are three if you are looking at one. 1. Automatic or manual. 2. Tech or minimal tech (adds cost). 3. Suspension, stiffer or softer or premium sport. If you max everything out this car will be in the mid $40s, new. Mini stopped making this model so you will have to be on the used car market. I actually like that as it keeps the car an uncommon model amongst and uncommon car. I like unique. Just drive one and see what you think. All of the coupe and roadsters are great but I think the base model sort of misses out with the low power. It is the sportiest of the lineup and also the smallest of the Mini's.

mini,cooper-coupe,2015,Primepowermariner, 11/16/2015,The best 2 seat coupe under $40k,5,"This car simply put is fun. It is fast, handles like a go cart and gets compliments everywhere I go. If you only want two seats then this is the car. Huge trunk, 33-35 mpg and good on insurance. It is not easy to get in and it rides like a sports car because it is one. This is exactly what I was looking for and it does not disappoint. The controls are quirky and I actually prefer them now. Great rare car.

The last two cars I had owned were a 2014 Ford Focus and a 2007 Saab 9-3, I enjoy driving the Mini as much as any car I've owned. The back seats are very limited, but you will know that going in.

Have been performance car freak since I was finally able to afford the original Datsun Z-car, then a series of Porsche 911's, finally a Boxster.  Just before getting a 2015 PACEMAN demo (2,00 miles on the clock) I was driving a 2012 BMW 330i coupe.  When oil leaks repair estimate came to three times what I had to put down for the 2015 MINI, the deal was made.  Have not been this happy with a car since my last 911 Carrera converatible!  OMG-- everything works! 32-33 mpg highway (lots of highway driving) on 89 octane), and decent, if not sparkling acceleration.  Wanted the 6-speed manual, but spouse insisted on automatic, and of course has driven it exactly once in almost a year.  Here in New England, ""performance driving"" is now gone.  Traffic is simply too heavy, and risk of expensive speeding ticket too big.  But moving along at 75+ with all the other trafic, especially the big semi rigs, no problem.  Dealer support has been the best ever, especially compared to  Porsche and BMW service.  Best of all, have seen maybe three Pacemen and none in the black sparkle of mine.   Love  it!

mini,cooper-paceman,2015,Tim, 04/20/2016,"Fun car, Terrible Electronics",4,"I've leased my 2015 MINI Cooper Paceman S for 9 months now, and have mixed feelings so far. 

Pros:
 - Fun to drive: the acceleration is great, and the car hugs the road on sharp curves (especially when SPORT mode is engaged). 
 - Interior is cool: the classic speedometer and the alternating lights make the interior of the car look pretty cool. The stereo system is okay, and it comes with aux/iPod support. The only downside of this is that the proprietary MINI aux/usb adapter is like $85 to buy, and it's basically a cable that combines a USB charger and the aux cable into 1 unified cable - huge ripoff. 
 - Sunroof is awesome 
 - Trunk space is better than expected

Cons: 
 - Gas mileage is extremely deceiving. The advertised MPG is something like 26 / 35. Ha! More like 17 / 23. I suppose most car companies slightly inflate their MPG numbers, but come on MINI.... 
 - Electronics suck pt 1: In hindsight, I should've paid for the premium electronics package - the standard is god awful. There is only 1 knob that controls the entire ""console"" - which is extremely minimal in features. Besides radio, it only has temperature, time, and MPG.. 
 - Electronics suck pt 2: For my MINI, I've had a bunch of small issues with the primary computer of the car. (1) The ""miles remaining"" number is wildly inaccurate. Within 2 minutes of normal city driving, the expected miles remaining dropped from 26 to 0, and then from 0 - 4. (2) The tire pressure lights are constant red-herrings.

Overall: fun car to drive on the highways and on open roads. Gas mileage is pretty crappy, and the electronics are really poor quality.

This is the most amount of fun I have ever had driving a car.
Nothing else compares! As far as convertibles I have owned a Miata, Z4 and a Mustang GT in the past and this Mini has a fun factor those 3 could not touch.
Sure the Mini is not the fastest out of those 3, but they did not evoke a fun to drive attitude as much as the Mini.

The option list on the Mini is crazy good, and (take note BMW) everything works like it is supposed to.

Original review:
I have owned my Roadster for slightly more than 2 years now. This is, without a doubt, the most fun car I will likely own. On a veautiful day or a balmy night, I think it is unrivaled. The multiple options offered are terrific, the car has been reliable and it is an incredibly fun drive. There are some cons... Backing up with the top up is a gamble at best, there are times I cannot see. The ride is rough, bumpy and loud. The Mini tech center could use a lot of work. For instance your phone is on Bluetooth audio but you want to charge your phine so you plug it in, now the next time you want to use Bluetooth audio you have to go through a maze of menus to re-select Bluetooth for music playback. That's silly. Would I buy it again? If it was my second car, in a heartbeat but as my daily driver as it is now, likely no.

I agree with the Edmunds review in that with the top up there is still a bit of noise and limited visibility, however, why would you want to drive this car with the top up? If it's raining outside I leave it in the garage. Otherwise, it's top down fun and exhilaration! The 6 speed manual is perfect for just that. I find it a struggle to not double the speed limit on most roads. In 3rd gear I can go as slow as 16 mph or as fast as 60. Almost like having an automatic. Ride can be rough at times but, hello, it's a sports car. Want a cushy ride? Buy a caddy! If you want pure driving fun with some awesome features, this is the car for you."

I have a four door luxury car and just wanted something to tool around in.  This car is exactly that.  It is great for a teenager or an old guy, like me, who thinks they are a teenager.  Really good mileage, unlike my Maserati.
